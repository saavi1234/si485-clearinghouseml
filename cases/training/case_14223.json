The Plaintiffs, represented by Children's Rights, Inc., the Nebraska Appleseed Center, and private counsel, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that Defendants were violating Plaintiffs' substantive and procedural due process rights under the United States Constitution; Plaintiffs' rights under the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (AACWA) and the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) program of the Medicaid Act. Plaintiffs also contended that Defendants were in breach of their own obligations under the state's State Plan contracts with the federal government under Titles IV-B and IV-E of the Social Security Act by denying Plaintiffs' rights to services and benefits as direct third-party beneficiaries of these State Plan contracts.</p><p>On January 19, 2007, the District Court (Judge Richard G. Kopf) entered a memorandum and order adopting Magistrate Judge David L. Piestar's Report and Recommendation denying Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification and granting Defendants' Motion to Dismiss on Younger abstention grounds. Specifically, the Court found Plaintiffs' proposed class definition to be \"both ambiguous and inconsistent with [Plaintiffs'] stated intent,\" and held that, even if less vague, the intended class lacked commonality and typicality. The Court further concluded that, under the doctrine announced in Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), the federal court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction in cases where equitable relief would interfere with pending state proceedings (here, the children's state juvenile court proceedings) in a way that offends principles of comity and federalism. The Court subsequently entered judgment for Defendants. Carson P. ex rel. Foreman v. Heineman, 240 F.R.D. 456 (D. Neb. 2007).</p>",

This is a civil rights class action brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on \nbehalf of all foster children w ho are or will be in the legal cu stody of the Nebraska Department \nof Health and Human Services (“HHS”).  The defendants in this action are Dave Heineman, as \nGovernor of the State of Nebraska; Nancy Mont anez, as the Directo r of Services, Nebraska \nHHS; Dr. Joann Schaefer, as the Director of Re gulation and Licensure, Nebraska HHS; Richard \n  -1-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 2 of 65 - Page ID # 399\n \nNelson, as the Director of Finance and Support,  Nebraska HHS; Dennis Loose, as the Chief \nDeputy Director of Services, Nebraska HHS; and Todd Reckling, Administrator of HHS’ Office \nof Protection and Safety (colle ctively, the “Defendants”).   A ll Defendants are sued in their  \nofficial capacities, as the administrators of Nebraska’s child welfare system. \n2.  Defendants’ failure to protect Nebraska’s foster children and provide them \nwith legally-required services subjects these children to significant and ongoing harm , deprives \nthem of a chance for a safe and stable childhood, and violates their rights under the United States \nConstitution and var ious federal statutes.  This  action se eks declaratory and inju nctive relief \nagainst Defendants to stop continuing violations of the legal rights of Nebraska’s foster children \nand to prevent Defendants, by their actions and  inactions, from continuing to harm  the very \nchildren that rely on the State for their care and protection. \nINTRODUCTION \n3.  There are more than 6,000 abused, ne glected or otherwise deprived \nchildren in the custody of HHS.  Instead of prov iding these traumatized and vulnerable children \nwith a safe and tem porary home, Nebraska ’s mismanaged, overburdened and under-funded \nfoster care system routinely further harms them and allows them to deteriorate, without the basic \ncare, services, protectio n and opportunities for a perm anent home that are necessary for their  \nphysical, emotional and psychological development and well-being.   \n4.  As a result of serious system ic deficiencies that have been known to \nDefendants for many years, the Nebraska foster care system operated by HHS inflicts numerous \nharms on abused and neglected children while they are in state custody, including: \na.  Frequent moves among multiple inappropriate placements.   Subjecting \nfoster children, especially those w ho have undergone the traum a of being \nremoved from an abusive or neglectful home, to repeated changes in their \nprimary caregivers causes serious harm  to their developm ent and \n  -2-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 3 of 65 - Page ID # 400\n \npsychological health. Yet data colle cted by HHS and r eported to the  \nfederal government shows that, of th e children in Defendants’ custody \nduring fiscal year 2004, nearly 32 % had experienced four or m ore \nplacements during th eir current stay in  foster care.  In an other example, \nthe annual report issued by the Nebras ka Foster Care Review Board in \n2004 (the “FCRB 2004 Report”) found that 50% of all children in “out-of-\nhome” foster care as of the last day  of 2003 had experienced four or more \nplacements during their time in foster care, and over 30% of those children \nhad been moved six or more times.    \nb.  Excessive stays in emergency shelte rs and other temporary facilities.   \nNebraskan children first entering foster  care and those already in state \ncustody who have th eir foster hom es or other placements “disrupt” are \nroutinely left for extended periods  of time, sometimes many months, in \ninappropriate emergency shelters and  other temporary f acilities intended \nfor very limited stays (no m ore than 30 days), often for the simple reason \nthat the S tate has nowhere else to  place them.  Trea tment services are  \nfrequently lacking in the shelters,  and these facilities often randomly mix \nyouth who have been adjudicated  delinquent with non-offenders, and \nchildren with aggressive physical  or sexual behaviors with young and \nvulnerable children.   \nc.  The placement of in fant and other very young foster  children in \nemergency shelters an d other temporary facilities.   In addition to th e \nharmful extended use of emergency shelters for children generally, group-\ncare facilities designed  for very sh ort stays are being regularly used as \nplacements for infants, toddlers and  other young children, sometimes for \nextended periods of time, again often because appropriate placements are \nunavailable.  The care of young ch ildren form ing critical bonds an d \ndevelopmental skills thr ough shifts of caretakers in  group facilities is \ndamaging to these children. \nd.  Overcrowded foster homes.  As a result of the lack of hom es and other \nplacements for foster children, foster  homes are regu larly overcrowded, \nsometimes housing more than six child ren at a tim e (many of them with \nspecial needs).  Such overcrowding prevents adequate parental supervision \nand places children at risk of harm. \ne.  Maltreatment of foster  children while in State custody.   Far too often \nchildren brought into N ebraska’s foster care custody because of abuse or \nneglect at the hands of their own biological parents or other caregivers are \nsubject to f urther maltreatment while in the cu stody of the State.  This \nmaltreatment occurs because of the St ate’s failure to (i) appropriate ly \nscreen and oversee foster hom es, (ii) segregate sexually  reactive children \n(often themselves the  victim of prior sexual abuse) or physically \naggressive children from other foster children, and (iii) adequately monitor \nand supervise visits betw een foster children  and their b iological family \n  -3-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 4 of 65 - Page ID # 401\n \nmembers when problem s that have not been  addressed place ch ildren at \nrisk of harm. \nf.  Overuse of institutional placements for children.  Due to a lack of foster \nhomes, Nebraskan foster children are inappropriately placed in institutions \nand other congregate facilities when  they could be appropriately placed \nwith foster fa milies.  T he State al so continues to p lace young children \n(including children under eight years of age) in institu tions and group \nfacilities, denying them  individualized treatment and im portant one-on-\none relationships with consistent caregivers. \ng.  Excessive lengths of stay in State custody.  Nebraskan foster children are \nunnecessarily spending large portions of their lives – and sometimes their \nentire childhoods – in fost er care.  Defendants fa il to provide foster \nchildren with appropriate case m anagement, case plans and the services, \nincluding adoption-relate d services, required to prevent children from \ngrowing up in state custody.  Nebras kan foster children are routinely \ndenied opportunities to  be adopted, and m any are discharged from  the \nfoster care system at or around the State’s age of majority without the life \nskills necessary for them to live independently. \n5.  These continuing harms to children are caused by a num ber of severe and \nlong-standing systemic deficiencies that plague Nebraska’s foster care system, including:  \na.  A severe shortage of fo ster homes.  HHS f ails to m aintain an adequate \nnumber and kind of foster hom es and other appropriate placem ents for \nfoster children.  Foster child ren are  placed wherever a bed or “s lot” is \navailable and not according to their individual needs. \nb.  High caseloads and turnover.   HHS caseworkers responsible for  \noverseeing the care and protection of  children in the State’s custody often \nhave dange rously high  caseloads that ar e f requently m ultiples of  the \nnational standard of 12-15 foster children per caseworker.  High caseloads \nand an unsupportive environment for many caseworkers have led to very \nhigh turnover rates.  In  urban a reas, caseworkers frequently leave after \nworking with HHS for one or two y ears and many leave well before that \ntime, often before they have even com pleted their training. As a result, \nfrontline staff members are frequently inexperienced.  \nc.  Poor monitoring of  child safety.   Nebraska’s foster homes are often \ninadequately screened for safety.   For exam ple, the FCRB 2004 Report \nfound that, in over 25% of the “out-o f-home” foster care cases reviewed \nby the Board during calendar year  2003, children were placed in homes \nthat were unsafe, inappropriate  or had never undergone a docum ented \nsafety assessment.  Additionally, high caseloads interfere with the ab ility \nof caseworkers to adequately monitor the safety of foster children assigned \n  -4-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 5 of 65 - Page ID # 402\n \nto them.  Recent state d ata shows that, for January 2005, at least 36% of \nfoster children statewide did not rece ive a required monthly contact from \ntheir caseworker. \nd.  A lack of basic health serv ices for foster children.   Nebr aska’s foster \nchildren are routinely d enied services necessary to addres s acute m ental \nhealth problems on the basis of cost.   These children are left in foster \nhomes that are unable to meet their needs and in which their mental health \nfurther deteriorates.  Foster children  are also denied timely basic medical \nexaminations and dental health services. \ne.  Poor planning and services to quickl y move children out of foster care \nand into permanent homes.  HHS routinely fails to provide foster children \nwith appropriate case m anagement, case plans and services, especially \nadoption-related services, that are re quired to ensure that children do not  \ngrow up languishing in State custody. In a 2002 audit of HHS, the fede ral \ngovernment identified the failure to establish goals for children’s \npermanent placement and the failu re to achieve adoption s in a tim ely \nmanner as “critical problems.”  These sam e “critical problems” continue \ntoday. \nf.  Grossly inadequate payments to foster care providers.  Nebraska fails to \nprovide payments to those caring for  foster children that even approach \nthe actual cost of care.  For exam ple, HHS pays foster parents as little as  \n$222 per month – less than $8 per day –  to raise a two-year-old foster \nchild, when the federal governm ent estimates that the average m onthly \ncost of raising a child in the rural  United States is $755 and even m ore in \nthe urban Midwest.  \ng.  Fiscal waste.   Nebraska regularly fails to co llect available federal funds \nfor foster children in S tate custody, foregoing many millions of dollars \nthat could be used to provide desper ately needed homes and services f or \nchildren.  \n6.  The harm s routinely inflicted on ch ildren in Nebraska’s foster care \ncustody, and the systemic deficiencies and pattern and practice of conduct from which they arise, \ncause the overall physical, emotional and psychological deterioration of foster children while in \nState custody. \n7.  Defendants have long been aware of  HHS’ ongoing and system ic failure \nto provide for the safety and well-being of Nebraska’s foster children, as all of these deficiencies \nhave been repeatedly docum ented in governm ental reports, audits and in the m edia.  Ye t \n  -5-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 6 of 65 - Page ID # 403\n \nDefendants have been unable or unwilling to address them.  The serial reform plans Defendants \nhave issued over the years have failed to ameliorate the ongoing systemic deficiencies and harms \nto Nebraska’s foster children detailed in this Complaint.  \n8.  These and other actions and inactions  of Defendants subject Nebraska’s  \nfoster children to significant and ongoing harm s, deprive them of a chance for a safe and stable \nchildhood, and violate their rights under the United States Constitution and federal statutes.  This \nlawsuit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief  to stop these ongoing lega l violations and the \nserious harms that flow from  them and ensure  that Defendants adequately care for and pro tect \nchildren in state custody, as required by law. \nJURSIDICTION AND VENUE \n9.

This action is prope rly maintained as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23 (a) and (b)(2). \n35.  The class is defined as:  “All foster children who are or will be in the legal \ncustody of HHS, including those alleged or adjudicated to be abused, neglected or abandoned by \ntheir parent, guardian or custodian, and thos e alleg ed or adjudicated to b e wayward, \nuncontrollable or habitually truant.”  \n36.  The plaintiff class is sufficiently  numerous. As of March 9, 2005, there \nwere approximately 6,674 foster children in the legal foster care custody of HHS, making joinder \nof all members impracticable.  \n37.  The questions of law and fact raised by the identified Named Plaintiffs are \ncommon to and typical of those raised by the putative class members.  Each Named Plaintiff and \neach putative class member is in need of foster  care services, must rely on Defendants for those \nservices, and is subject to HHS’ harmful systemic deficiencies. \n38.  Questions of fact shared by the Nam ed Plaintiffs and the p utative class \nmembers (together, the “Plaintiffs” or the “Plaintiff children”) include:  \n  -10-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 11 of 65 - Page ID # 408\n \na.  whether Defendants fail to provide fo ster children in their custody with \nsafe, stable and appropriate foster care placements, as required by law and \nreasonable professional standards; \nb.  whether Defendants fail to provide fo ster children in their custody with \nlegally required safety, protection and  services necessary to prevent them \nfrom deteriorating physically, psychologically, emotionally, or otherwise, \nwhile in state custody;  \nc.  whether Defendants fail to provide  appropriate and tim ely permanency \nplanning and services for  children in foster care  to assure that they  are \nproperly cared for and either safely re united with their families or freed \nfor adoption and prom ptly placed in  another permanent home, consistent \nwith applicable law and reasonable professional standards; and \n \nd.  whether Defendants fail to provide foster children in their custody with the \nopportunity to m aintain critical fa mily relationships, including through \nvisitation with their siblings. \n \n39.  Common questions of law include: \na.  whether Defendants’ actions and inac tions violate Plaintiffs’ rights under \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution to be safe from harm while in state custody;  \nb.  whether Defendants’ actions and inac tions violate Plaintiffs’ rights under \nthe Adoption Assistance and Child  Welfare Act of 1980, a s amended by \nthe Adoption and Safe Fa milies Act of 1997, and relevan t federal \nregulations, to mandated foster care and adoption services and foster care \nmaintenance payments;  \nc.  whether Defendants’ actions and inac tions violate Plaintiffs’ rights under \nthe Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment program of the \nMedicaid Act, and relevant federal regulations;  \nd.  whether Defendants’ actions and inact ions violate Plai ntiffs’ rights to \nfamilial association under the First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe United States Constitution; and \ne.  whether Defendants’ actions and  in actions breach con tractual righ ts \nenjoyed by Plaintiffs as third-party be neficiaries to Nebraska’s State Plan \ncontracts with the federal government pursuant to Titles IV-B and IV-E of \nthe Social Security Act.    \n  -11-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 12 of 65 - Page ID # 409\n \n40.  The legal violations alle ged by the Na med Plaintiffs are typical of those \nraised by each m ember of the putative class.   The harms suffered by the Na med Plaintiffs are \ntypical of the harms suffered by all children in the putative class. \n41.  Each Named Plaintiff appears by a next friend pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.

The Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nmembers of the putative class. \n43.  The Named Plaintiffs and the putative clas s are represented by attorneys \nemployed by Children’s Rights, a national non-pr ofit legal organization based in New York, \nNew York, with experience in co mplex child welfare class actions ; attorneys employed by \nNebraska Appleseed Center for Law in the Public Interest, a non-profit, non-partisan law project \nbased in Lincoln, Nebraska, with experience in complex welfare and Medicaid class actions; and \nattorneys from Ogborn, Summerlin & Ogborn, P.C., a  private law firm with offices in Lincoln, \nNebraska and Denver, Colorado, with experience  in complex federal court class actions; DLA \nPiper Rudnick Gray Cary US LLP, an internati onal private law firm  with offices in citie s \nthroughout the country, with experience in comp lex federal court cla ss actions; and Cline, \nWilliams, Wright, Johnson & Oldfather, L.L.P., a private firm with offices in Lincoln, Omaha, \nAurora and Scottsbluff, Nebraska, and Fort Co llins, Colorado; Woods & Aitken LLP, a private \nfirm with offices in  Lincoln and Omaha; and Gross & Welch, P.C., L.L.O., a private law firm \nwith offices in Omaha, all with experience in complex federal court litigation.   \n44.

Carson, now eight years old, has been  in HHS custody for approxim ately \ntwo years.  A victim of sexual abuse and fetal alcohol syndrome, Carson has serious mental and \nbehavioral health needs.  Thr oughout his term in foster care Carson has routinely been, and is \nnow being, denied access to treatment and services  appropriate to these significant needs, to his \ngreat detriment.   \n47.  Carson came into HHS custody in Se ptember 2003 as a six-year-old.    \nWhen police officers arrived at Carson’s house , they found him  carrying around an axe and \ndetermined that he had  access to other weap ons, including a knife, and drug paraphernalia.   \nCarson had been encouraged to drink alcohol and smoke in the home and at the time of removal \nhis teeth were severely decayed. \n48.  Carson was placed in to a foster ho me that was provid ed alm ost no \ninformation about his medical, em otional and mental health needs and the circum stances under \nwhich he came into care. \n49.  After several m onths in foster car e, Carson reported being repeatedly \nsexually abused prior to rem oval.  Carson was  taken to be interviewe d at Project Harm ony, \nOmaha’s Child Advocacy Center, but he becam e frightened and was unable to com plete the \ninterview process.   \n  -13-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 14 of 65 - Page ID # 411\n \n50.  Though Carson talks op enly of his desi re to harm and even kill people, \nhears voices, and describes dream s in which he  molests other children, he was no t assessed in \nany formal manner at or around the tim e he came into care and HHS has consistently im peded \nany and all efforts to obtain ap propriate trea tment f or Carson’ s various m ental health and \nbehavioral problems.   \n51.  During his first eight months in fo ster care, Carson’s HHS caseworker \nfailed to visit him even a single tim e.  For much of this period he was provided with no therapy \nwhatsoever, despite repeated requests by those  charged with his care w ho were witnessing his \ntroubling symptoms and behaviors first-hand.  When Carson’s caseworker finally approved basic \ntherapy by a counselor, not  a psychologist, it w as insufficient to even begin to m atch Carson’s \nneeds, because, am ong other reasons, he rece ived only a single 30-mi nute session every two \nweeks. \n52.  In the months following Carson’s first outcry about his sexual abuse, he \nbegan speaking about the abuse in more explicit de tail with his foster parents and, eventually, \nwith his therapist.  These allegations were referred to Carson’s HHS cas e manager.  The case  \nmanager, however, refused to report the allegation s, and they were not investigated, despite the \nfact that one of the alleged perpetrators was Carson’s biological mother’s boyfriend and Carson’s \npermanency plan was then, as it still is today, reunification with Carson’s biological mother. \n53.  Though Carson has remained in care far longer than 15 of t he most recent \n22 months, Carson’s permanency goal remains reunification and a petition seeking term ination \nof his parental rights has not yet been filed.   HHS has also not yet even begun the process of \nlocating Carson’s biological father.  \n  -14-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 15 of 65 - Page ID # 412\n \n54.  Throughout most of his nearly tw o-year stay in foster care, Carson has  \nbeen denied any visits with siblings, cousins, and other family members. \n55.  The foster care maintenance payments made to Carson’s foster parents on \nhis behalf have consistently failed to cover the actual costs of caring for him. \n56.  HHS recently placed Carson with a rela tive who has not b een adequately \ntrained or otherwise prepared to  address Carson’s substantial ne eds, a problem made worse by \nthe grossly inadequate therapy being provided him. \n57.  Defendants’ actions and inactions are part of a systemic pattern of conduct \nthat has caused Carson, and continues to cause  Carson, irreparable harm .  Defe ndants have \nviolated, and acted in delib erate indifference to and  beyond the bounds of reasonabl e \nprofessional judgm ent regard ing, Carson’s co nstitutional and statutory rights by  failing to  \nprovide necessary services and an appropriate placem ent for him ; by failing to make period ic \ncomprehensive assessm ents of his  needs, incl uding his m ental health  needs, and providing \nservices co nsistent with thos e needs; by failing to m ake tim ely and m eaningful casework \ncontacts and monitor his progress in foster care in order to  ensure his safety and well-being; by \nfailing to provide him with monitoring and services necessary to prevent him from deteriorating \nphysically, psychologically, emotionally, educationally or otherwis e while in state custody; by \nfailing to pay foster care m aintenance payments on his behalf that cover the reasonable costs of \ncaring for him; by failing to support his family relationships, in particular by not providing child-\nsibling visits; by failing to provide appropriate management and supervision while he has been in \nHHS custody in accordance with his individual needs, best interests, and reasonable professional \nstandards; by failing to provide case management and planning in accordance with his individual \nneeds, best interests, and reasonable professi onal standards; and by  failing to develop and \n  -15-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 16 of 65 - Page ID # 413\n \nimplement a viable permanent plan that will allow him to leave foster care and secure a safe and \nappropriate perm anent hom e in accordan ce with  his in dividual needs, best interes ts, an d \nreasonable professional standards. \nPaulette V. \n \n58.  Paulette V. has been languishing in the State’s foster care custody for most \nof the last twelve years, duri ng which time she has been physica lly or sexually abused on three \nseparate occasions and has been subjected to at least 17 different foster placements, a number of \nthem dangerous and cle arly inappropriate to meet her needs.  Paulette, who will b e turning 19 \nyears old in less than a year, has not been provided a legally mandated written transitional living \nplan and other services necessary to adequately prepare her for adulthood. \n59.  Paulette was rem oved from her biological m other’s care into the legal \ncustody of HHS when she was five years old.  Upon entering the system, HHS separated Paulette \nfrom her younger brother and sister  who were also taken into foster care, and she was denied \nvisitation with them for more than 10 years. \n60.  HHS originally p laced Paulette in a relativ e foster hom e in the Om aha \narea, more than 350 miles from where she was living at the time she came into care.  During the \ncourse of Paulette’s approximately five-year stay at this home, the relative with whom she was \nplaced was incarcerated for a drug offense.  HHS did not seek to remove Paulette from the home \nat the time or otherwise appropriately monitor her safety and the adequacy of supervision in the \nhome.  To the contrary, she was only rarely vi sited by her HHS caseworker.  At age 10, as HHS  \ncontinued in its failure to m onitor Paulette’s  safety and well-being, Paulette was repeatedly \nsexually abused by an older boy living in the home.  \n  -16-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 17 of 65 - Page ID # 414\n \n61.  Paulette wa s then sen t by HHS to live with  a m ore distant relativ e.  \nNotwithstanding her prior sexual  abuse, HHS arranged for Paul ette to receive only m inimal \ncounseling.  Given her past expe riences, Paulette found the stress of living with a num ber of \nolder boys in the home intolerable and she was moved by HHS to yet another relative placement, \nher fourth foster home since entering care.   \n62.  Paulette lived in this ho me, which eventually to ok legal guardianship of \nher, for about three years.  In this hom e, Paulette was physically abused by her relative foster \nparent.  She reported the abuse.  However, despite extensive bruising, no action was taken either \nby the police or by HHS.  Paulette came back into HHS legal custody when, at the  age of 13, she \nwas again sexually abused, this tim e by a boyfrie nd of her relative fost er parent and then \nguardian.   \n63.  Paulette was next shuffled through a string of group homes.  The repeated \nand serious psychological and physical traum as she had suffered during her years in HHS \ncustody manifested themselves in increasingly difficult to control behaviors.  She was eventually \ntransferred by HHS to a highly re strictive residential treatment center, where s he lived f or \napproximately six months.  Though Paulette attended an in-house school in  the facility, none of \nthe credits she earned while in this school were accepted once she returned to mainstream public \nschool, and, as a result, she was forced to repeat the 8th Grade.   \n64.  HHS then s ent Paulette to y et another relative foster home, where  she \nlived for nearly two years.  The pattern of  scarce visitation by HHS and inadequate counseling \ncontinued.  This placement was  also eventually formalized into a guardianship, but only three \nmonths later Paulette came back into f oster care when she attem pted suicide and HHS had her \nplaced in a psychiatric hospital for several months.     \n  -17-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 18 of 65 - Page ID # 415\n \n65.  Upon discharge from this psychiatric hosp ital, HHS placed Paulette in a \nprivately run Omaha emergency shelter to await yet another foster placement.  She remained in \nthis inappropriate facility for approximately three months while HHS purportedly sought to find \nher an appropriate home.  The shelter, intended  for extremely short stays of up to 30 days, was \npopulated by a m ix of delinquent, neglected  and abused teens and som e younger children, \nincluding children less than five years of age.  HHS  next placed Paulette in a different shelter in \nOmaha where she resided for over a m onth before running away after a dispute with another \nresident.  She was then kept for a number of days in a locked facility.  \n66.  Paulette was then p laced by HHS for  nearly two years in a series of \nrestrictive group placem ents, including a reside ntial treatment center, operated by a privat e \nprovider.  She continued to be visited by HHS only sporadically during this time.  She repeatedly \nasked her HHS caseworker to be transferred to a fa mily home but was told that no such hom es \nwere available.   \n67.  In late 2004, as a 17-year-old, Paulette was at last placed by HHS into a \nfamily foster home, at least her 17th foster care placement.  Paulette – now 18 years of age – has \nnot been involved in the required process of developing and implementing a Written Transitional \nLiving Plan and is not otherwise being adequately prepared for her transition to adulthood at age \n19, a transition that will surely be harder for  Paulette given the m any harms inflicted upon her \nduring her years in HHS custody. \n68.

Danielle is a seven-year-old child who has spent the majority of her life in \nstate custody and is now more than two years into her second extended stay in foster care.  HHS \n  -19-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 20 of 65 - Page ID # 417\n \nhas failed to provide Danielle with the case plan ning and services needed to m ove her on to a \npermanent home.  In fa ct, for much of the last  calendar year, Danielle’s perm anency goal has \nbeen “long term foster care,” a m anifestly inappropriate goal for an e minently adoptable child \nsuch as Danielle. \n70.  Danielle originally entered the foster  care system  as a toddler follow ing \nthe drowning of her younger brother.  After a pproximately a year and a half in HHS custody, \nDanielle was returned home.  In 2003, Danielle re-entered the foster care system as a four-year-\nold after one of her teachers reported signs of physical abuse. \n71.  Danielle is hearing  impaired and si gnificantly developmentally delayed.  \nAt the time of her re-entry into  foster care, Danielle had a hearing aide but had not been taught \nhow to use it.  The foster care m aintenance payments made to her foster parents on her behalf \nhave consistently failed to cover the actual costs of caring for her.     \n72.  HHS failed to take necessary steps to provide Danielle’s biological mother \nwith the services n ecessary to further the purported goal of reunification or to  determine that \nreunification was inappropriate and implement another permanency plan.  \n73.  More than a year into Danielle’s second foster care stay, it was determined \nthat Danielle’s mother could not safely and appropriately care for Danielle.  Notwithstanding this \ndetermination and the fact that Danielle’s foster mother had indicated that she was ready, willing \nand able to adopt Danielle, instead of prom ptly seeking to term inate parental rights so that \nDanielle could be adopted, HHS recomm ended that Danielle’s p ermanency goal be changed \nfrom reunification to “long term  foster care,” clearly an inappropriate goal for a child as young \nas Danielle for whom a potential stable and  perm anent adoptive h ome had already been \nidentified. \n  -20-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 21 of 65 - Page ID # 418\n \n74.  Although a petition seeking term ination of Danielle’s mothers parental \nrights has recently been filed, HHS continues to fail to take reasonable steps to seek and secure a \npermanent and stable hom e for Danielle.  For  example, HHS has not yet begun the process of \nfinding and terminating the rights of Danielle’s biological father or ti mely or ap propriately \nfollowed-up on Danielle’s m other’s claim of a  tribal affiliation for Danielle, both necessa ry \nprecursors to Danielle actually achieving permanency. \n75.  During her time in foster care, HHS has failed to arrange for even a single \nvisit between Danielle a nd either of her sisters, both of w hom have been in foster care for a \nnumber of years.  Moreover, HHS has failed to appropriately monitor the visits between Danielle \nand her mother, delegating responsibilities for su ch monitoring (and transportation to and from \nthe visits) to a constantly changing corps of under-trained and inexperienced staff employed by a \nprivate subcontractor.  \n76.  Defendants’ actions and inactions are part of a systemic pattern of conduct \nthat has caused Danielle, and continues to cause  Danielle, irreparable ha rm.  Defendants have \nviolated, and acted in delib erate indifference to and  beyond the bounds of reasonabl e \nprofessional judgment regard ing, Danielle’s c onstitutional and statutory righ ts by failing to \nprovide necessary services and an appropriate p ermanent placement for her; by failing to m ake \nperiodic comprehensive assessm ents of her ne eds; by failing to m ake timely and m eaningful \ncasework contacts and monitor her progress in foster care in order to ensure her safety and well-\nbeing; by f ailing to provide her with m onitoring and services necessary to prevent her from  \ndeteriorating physically, psychologically, emotionally, educationally or otherwise while in state \ncustody; by failing to su pport her family relationships by not providing child-sibling visits; by \nfailing to pay foster care m aintenance payments on her behalf that cover the costs of caring for \n  -21-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 22 of 65 - Page ID # 419\n \nher; by failing to provide appr opriate management and supervision while she has been in HHS \ncustody in accordan ce with her in dividual needs, best in terests, and reasonable professional \nstandards; by failing to provide case management and planning in accordance with her individual \nneeds, best interests, and reasonable professi onal standards; and by  failing to develop and \nimplement a viable permanent plan that will allow her to leave foster care and secure a safe and \nappropriate perm anent hom e in accordan ce with  her in dividual needs, best interes ts, an d \nreasonable professional standards. \nCheryl H. \n77.  Cheryl H. has been in foster care for nine years.  Because of HHS’ failure \nto appropriately assess Cheryl’s needs and place her in accordance with them  and HHS’ failure \nto develop, train and support fost er parents capable of m eeting the needs of children like her, \nCheryl has unnecessarily suffered through m ore than a dozen placement changes and has spent \nsignificant periods of her  life in ins titutional settings.  As a  result of HHS’ failure to provide \nCheryl with appropriate treatment and case planning services, Cher yl has also been denied the \nopportunity for a stable home through adoption or guardianship.  Instead, she has been permitted \nto steadily deteriorate while in state custody.     \n78.  Within a short time of coming into care, Cheryl – then only nine years old \n– was placed for an extended stay in a large  group home, far from the biological mother with \nwhom the state’s plan was for her to be reuni fied.  W hen this pla cement disrupted, she was \nplaced with a pair of first-tim e foster parents who struggled for a little under a year to meet her \nvery significant m ental health and behavioral  needs with almost no cas eworker supervision, \nsupport (including respite services ) or training from  HHS.  On  several occasions during her \nplacement in the hom e, Cheryl’s condition  dete riorated to th e p oint that she requ ired \n  -22-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 23 of 65 - Page ID # 420\n \nhospitalization in the children’s ward of a psychiatric hospital, but each time she was returned to \nthe foster home without significant additional supports or services.  U ltimately that placement \nalso disrupted and Cheryl then spent more than a year living in an emergency children’s shelter \nwith children of various ages and emotional, me ntal health and behavior al needs, a m anifestly \ninappropriate placement for a troubled girl who was then only 11 years old. \n79.  Cheryl’s placement when she was at last moved from the shelter was with \nanother set of first-time foster parents, again with no special training in the provision of anything \nbut basic n on-therapeutic foster care.  This  placement was also pun ctuated by a num ber of \npsychiatric hospitalizations but, as before, no alternative placem ent or stabilization and support \nservices to the foster home were offered or tried.    \n80.  When this placem ent also disrup ted, Cheryl was placed for a period of \ntime with a residential treatment center, and then moved through a number of group placements \noperated by the sam e provider that ran the treatm ent center.  At approxim ately the age of 16, \nCheryl was again placed in an unsupported “traditional” foster home that was ultimately unable \nto handle her.  W hen that p lacement disrupted, she was returned to a children ’s shelter for \napproximately a m onth, and is currently livi ng with yet another fost er parent, awaiting \nemancipation when she turns 19  in January 2006.   There is  minimal planning being done for \nCheryl’s future transition to adulthood, a future th at looks uncertain at best in view of her m any \nbehavioral, developmental and mental health problems – problems that have either been caused \nor exacerbated by her many years in foster care.     \n81.  Defendants’ actions and inactions are part of a systemic pattern of conduct \nthat has caused Cheryl, and continues to cause  Cheryl, irreparable harm .

Jacob is a 13-year-old boy who has b een HHS custody nearly half of his \nlife.  Jacob is developm entally delayed with an  extensive history of behavioral problems, many \ncaused or exacerbated by his experiences in state custody.  During his time in foster care, Jacob \nhas been shuffled amongst at least 11 different foster care placem ents, including five different \n  -24-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 25 of 65 - Page ID # 422\n \nplacements in the past year and a half, many of which were wholly inappropriate to, and failed to \nmeet, his extensive needs.       \n83.  Jacob first came into HHS custody in December 1996, at age four.  Jacob  \nwas neglected medically and had been given alc ohol by family members in order to control his  \nbehaviors.     \n84.  After stays in a num ber of placem ents, including vari ous institutional \nsettings, Jacob was placed in  a potentially adoptive hom e in A ugust 1999, into which he wa s \nadopted in November 2000. \n85.  Throughout Jacob’s adoption, he repor ted being slapped and otherwise \nverbally and emotionally abused by his adoptive parents.  In November 2002, HHS investigated \nabuse allegations against his adoptive parents, but of fered no additional services to the family.  \nWhile in the home, another foster child, who had also been adopted by Jacob’s adoptive parents, \nthreatened to kill Jacob.   In additio n, Jacob allegedly acted out sexually towards this adoptive  \nbrother. \n86.  As a result of these and other be haviors, Jacob’s adoptive parents \nrepeatedly requested that HHS pr ovide services in order to help  them successfully deal with \nJacob’s needs and behaviors, including inpatien t treatment for Jacob’s adoptive brother that \nwould separate the boys.  HHS’ contractor, Mage llan, denied services to Jacob and his adoptive \nparents without reason.  Instead of  offering services to keep the  family intact, HHS offered the  \nparents an infor mation packet and threatened  the adoptive parents with prosecution if they \nabandoned Jacob’s adopted brother. \n87.  Jacob’s adoption disrupted and his adoptive parent s relinquished custody \nback to HHS in February 2004.  Since that tim e, Jacob has had at least four placem ent changes \n  -25-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 26 of 65 - Page ID # 423\n \nand currently resides in a group home.  Although Jacob had been in care for many years prior to \nhis disrupted adoption, he was  only recently tested for Fetal Alcohol Syndrom e even though he \nexhibited facial featu res consistent with th e diagnosis.  In  addition, J acob was not given a \nneuropsychological evaluation until December 2004.     \n88.  As a result of his exten sive time in State custody and multiple placement \nmoves, Jacob suffers from  severe attachm ent problems.  Though Jacob desperately needs the \npermanency that only a properly supported adoptive home can provide, his primary permanency \ngoal is not adoption, but rather guardianship.   Although Jacob now has a concurrent goal of \nadoption, HHS has taken no steps towards that goal and Jacob is not currently listed on the HHS \nadoption website.   \n89.  Defendants’ actions and inactions are part of a systemic pattern of conduct \nthat has caused Jacob, and continues to cause Jacob, irreparable harm.  Defendants have violated, \nand acted in deliberate indifference to a nd beyond the bounds of reasonable professional \njudgment regarding, Jacob’s constitutional and st atutory rights by failing to provide necessary \nservices an d an appro priate perm anent place ment for him ; by failing to m ake periodic \ncomprehensive assessments of his needs; by failing to provide him with monitoring and services \nnecessary to prevent him  from deteriora ting physically, psychologically, em otionally, \neducationally or otherwise while in state cus tody; by failing to provide appropriate managem ent \nand supervision while he has been in HHS custody in accordance with his individual needs, best \ninterests, and reasonable prof essional standards; by failing  to provide case m anagement and \nplanning in accordance with his in dividual needs, best in terests, and reasonab le professional \nstandards; and by failing to develop and implement a viable permanent plan that will allow him \n  -26-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 27 of 65 - Page ID # 424\n \nto leave foster care and secure  a safe and appropriate permanent home in accordance with his \nindividual needs, best interests, and reasonable professional standards. \nBobbi W. \n90.  Bobbi is a 14-year old girl who has been in HHS custody for alm ost five \nyears.  A victim  of se xual abuse, Bobbi has b een diagnosed with m ild mental retardation, \ndisruptive behavior disorder, ADHD, and Oppos itional Defiant Disorder.  She has been \nsubjected to over twen ty different foster car e placements, many of them  highly secure group  \nhomes, shelters, and hospitals.  Bobbi has also  had at least eight different case workers during \nher time in HHS custody.    \n91.  Bobbi first entered HHS custody in  May 2001 as an eight-year-old.  Her  \nbiological mother voluntarily re linquished custody of her, stati ng that she could not care for \nBobbi due to her physically aggressive behaviors.    Within a month of entering HHS custody in \nMay 2001, Bobbi was returned to her m other but she reentered HHS cust ody alm ost \nimmediately.  For the next six m onths, Bobbi was shuffled through a string of group hom es and \nseries of stays in the Child Adolescent Psychiatric Unit (CAPS Unit) at BryanLGH Hospital. \n92.  In early 20 02, HHS placed Bobbi, then ten-years-o ld, in her only lon g-\nterm non-institutional foster care placement.  The family, a first-time foster family in which the \nfoster mother had over 20 years  of experience working with deve lopmental disabilities and an \nMS degree in counseling, had approached HHS  in 2001 for the express purpose of fostering \nBobbi.   During the entirety of he r two-and-a-half year stay with  this foster fam ily, Bobbi’s \npermanency plan rem ained reunification despite  Bobbi’s biological m other’s inability to m eet \nthe plan goals and stated desire not to have Bobbi return to her care.   \n  -27-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 28 of 65 - Page ID # 425\n \n93.  During this long-term  placement, Bobbi desired to be adopted by her \nfoster family and repeatedly shared this desire  with her H HS caseworker.  In addition, and in \nspite of Bobbi’s continued intense m ental health needs and physically aggr essive behaviors, the \nfoster family wanted to adopt Bobbi and repeatedly expressed this to HHS. \n94.  As a result of Bobbi’s HHS caseworker’s inability to work in cooperation \nwith Bobbi’s long-term foster mother, along with other factors, in April 2004 Bobbi was moved, \nabruptly and with alm ost no transitioning, from th e one foster placement that had been able to \nmanage her behaviors (and in fact wished to ad opt her in spite of them).  Compounding matters, \nHHS transferred Bobbi to a foster hom e over 100  miles away from her previous foster fam ily, \nwith whom she was permitted no visitation. Bobbi’s behaviors in this new placement predictably \nescalated and she required hospitalization in the BryanLGH CAPS Unit at least six times during \nher first six months with this new foster family. In December 2004, Bobbi’s placement disrupted \ndue to her new f oster family’s inability to m anage her new behavior al problems and otherwise \ncare for her.  She has been institutionalized ever since.  \n95.  Bobbi has been in foster care for fa r longer than 15 of the previous 22 \nmonths, and Bobbi’s prim ary perm anency pl an rem ains reunification.  A pet ition seekin g \ntermination of Bobbi’s parental rights was not  filed until October 2004,  more than three years \nafter she entered HHS custody.   The petition is pending.    \n96.  Bobbi’s concurrent perm anency plan is adoption.  However, HHS ha s \ntaken no steps towards achieving  that goal.  Bobbi is curren tly languishing in a group hom e, \nwhere HHS has kept her for m ore than a year.   The group hom e is inappropriate to Bobbi’s \nneeds.  Among other things, one of the hom e’s other two residents is 23 years old; Bobbi has  \nvery few personal effects; and her room’s furnishings consist of a mattress on the floor.   \n  -28-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 29 of 65 - Page ID # 426\n \n97.  Bobbi is 14  years old and faces the prospect of never b eing adopted o r \notherwise achieving permanency due to HHS’ failure to provide her with long-term placement in \na home-like setting and perm anency planning appropriate to her needs.  Her m ental health and \nbehavioral problems have been caused, or at a minimum, greatly exacerbated by HHS’ failure to \nprovide her with a stable hom e in a family setting.  Rather than looking forward to a placem ent \nwith a potentially adoptive foster family, Bobbi is currently on the wa iting list to be adm itted \ninto the Beatrice State Developmental Center.   \n98.  Defendants’ actions and  inactions have caused B obbi, and continue to \ncause Bobbi, irreparable harm .  Defendants have  violated, and acted in  deliberate indifference \ntowards and beyond the bounds of reasonable pr ofessional judgm ent regarding, Bobbi’s \nconstitutional and statutory rights by failing to provide an appropriate p ermanent placement for \nher; by failing to m ake periodic comprehensive assessments of her needs; by failing to provide \nher with m onitoring and servi ces necessary to pr event her from  deteriorating physically, \npsychologically, emotionally, educationally or ot herwise while in state custody; b y failing to  \nprovide appropriate m anagement and supervis ion while she has been in HHS custody in \naccordance with her ind ividual needs, best interests, and reasona ble professional standards; by \nfailing to provide case management and planning in accordance with her individual needs, best \ninterests, and reasonable profe ssional standards; and by faili ng to develop and implem ent a \nviable permanent plan that will allow her to leave foster care and secure  a safe and appropriate \npermanent hom e in accordance with her indivi dual need s, best interests, and reasonable  \nprofessional standards. \nHannah A. \n99.  Hannah, who is only seven-years-ol d, has already experienced over 14 \ndifferent foster care placem ents over th e course of her nearly  four years in H HS custody.  \n  -29-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 30 of 65 - Page ID # 427\n \nThough Hannah has m anifested signs of serious m ental and behavioral health problem s for a  \nconsiderable time – in cluding Reactive Attachment  Disorder, a p redictable by-product of her \nmany placement moves – HHS failed to properly ev aluate her for nearly th ree years, during \nwhich time some of Hannah’s more serious problems remained undiagnosed and unaddressed.   \nAs a result of this failure on HHS’ part, the  increasingly severe behaviors her m any HHS-\nsponsored placement moves helped to cause, and the fact that HHS has perm itted her to sp end \nmore than half of her life in foster care, Ha nnah is now in danger of spending the rest of her \nchildhood in state custody.  \n100.  Hannah was brought into HHS custody in January 2002 following reports \nof drug abuse in her biological hom e, bruises on  her face, and a festering wound on her head.    \nHannah was initially placed as a  three-year-old in a non-kinship  foster home with persons who \nwere familiar to her.  Though she reported pre-removal sexual abuse by her biological father (as \nwould her half-sister), within  four months of c oming into care Hannah, her younger sister, and \ntwo half-siblings were placed back into the phys ical custody of her bio logical parents (though \nHHS retained legal custody).  Less than four mont hs after her return hom e, due to her parents  \nfailure to provide for her mental health needs, HHS moved Hannah, her sister, and her two half-\nsiblings to another family foster care placement, this time with their grandmother. \n101.  In this placement, however, Hannah’s medical needs were again ignored.   \nShe developed a severe ear infection and her ear drained foul smelling and discolored liquid for \nweeks before being treated, and though Hannah and  her younger sister were routinely sick, their \nprescription medications were  almost never brought to day care  so that they could be given \nrequired doses during the day.  In addition, Hanna h and her siblings were not bathed and not \nmade to brush their teeth on a regular basis.   Though HHS was m ade aware of these concerns, \n  -30-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 31 of 65 - Page ID # 428\n \nnothing was done to m ove Hannah and HHS pr ovided little or no additional support or training \nto her relative foster parent. \n102.  Hannah’s behavior deteriorated in  her grandmother’s hom e, her third \nfoster placement, and she began  to noticeably regress.  In February 20 03, Hannah’s two older \nhalf siblings were removed from the home and moved to a different placement.  Hannah and her \nyounger sibling, however, remained in the home for at least an additional year. \n103.  During 2004, HHS m oved Hannah on a  number of occasions, including \nthrough several inadequately screened and superv ised non-family and relative placements.  On \none occasion, Hannah was sent out of state to live  with a relative with  a criminal record.  She  \nwas returned with marks and bruises and was alleged to have sexually acted out on another child \nin the out-of-state ho me.  There after, Hannah was placed with an unprepared and largely \nunsupported foster family that after only six weeks dropped Hannah off at a shelter for homeless \nfamilies (not even a children’ s shelter), where HHS perm itted her to s pend at leas t one night \nbefore she was rescued – not by HHS – but by a former foster mother.  More recently, Hannah – \nthough only seven years of age – was placed b y HHS for several weeks in  a shelter that hosts \nchildren and youth of both sexes, ranging in age  from 0-18.  Most recently, Han nah has been \nplaced in yet another non-relative family foster home in the Omaha area.   \n104.  Hannah’s biological parents’ rights  were terminated in Septem ber 2004, \nnearly three years after she en tered care.  Ov er the cou rse of Hannah’s tim e in care, HHS \npermanency planning on her behalf  has suffered significantly due to worker turnover (she is on \nat least her fourth case worker).  Hannah has  been free for adoption for well over a year, but \ncontinues to languish in foster  care without HHS providing her  a stable long-term placem ent, \nmuch less an adoptive or other permanent home.     \n  -31-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 32 of 65 - Page ID # 429\n \n105.  Hannah suffers from significant mental  and behavioral health problems  \nwhich were not fully diagnosed until August 2005.  During her tim e in care, Hannah has not \nreceived necessary serv ices, including the scop e of therapy needed to  address her significant \nmental health needs.  HHS has also failed to  arrange for services to address Hannah’s learning \ndisability. \n106.  Defendants’ actions and inactions ha ve caused Hannah, and continue to \ncause Hannah, irreparable harm.  Defendants have violated, and acted in deliberate indifference \ntowards and beyond the bounds of reasonable pr ofessional judgm ent regarding, Hannah’s  \nconstitutional and statutory rights by failing to provide an appropriate p ermanent placement for \nher; by failing to m ake periodic comprehensive assessments of her needs; by failing to provide \nher with m onitoring and servi ces necessary to pr event her from  deteriorating physically, \npsychologically, emotionally, educationally or ot herwise while in state custody; b y failing to  \nprovide appropriate m anagement and supervis ion while she has been in HHS custody in \naccordance with her ind ividual needs, best interests, and reasona ble professional standards; by \nfailing to provide case management and planning in accordance with her individual needs, best \ninterests, and reasonable profe ssional standards; and by faili ng to develop and implem ent a \nviable permanent plan that will allow her to leave foster care and secure  a safe and appropriate \npermanent hom e in accordance with her indivi dual need s, best interests, and reasonable  \nprofessional standards. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS REGARDING SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCIES AND \nTHE RESULTING HARMS TO FOSTER CHILDREN IN STATE CUSTODY \n \n107.

Defendants have the authority and the  legal responsibility  to ensure that \nfoster children in state custody receive the services, care and protection to which they are legally \nentitled, yet past attempts to address the m any pronounced deficiencies in Nebraska’s child \nwelfare system, and in particular its foster  care and adoption program s, have been largely \nineffective and in any  event not targeted at  the p roblems delineated in this  Com plaint.  \nDefendants have long known of the injuries an d harms suffered by Plaintiff children (and their \npredecessors in the State’s foster care system ) as a result of Defendants’ pattern and practice of \naction and inaction.  Their failure to take th e steps necessary to am eliorate these ongoing, \nsystemic harms reflects a clear departure fro m any reasonable exercise  of their professional  \njudgment, and is also in deliberate indifference to Plaintiff’s health, safety and well-being.   \nDangerous and Inappropriate Foster Care Placements and Placement Processes \n109.  Plaintiff children who have been tr aumatized by abuse and  neglect and \nremoval from their hom es are subject to further  harm while in the  State’s foster care sy stem \nbecause of a grave sho rtage of ap propriate  numbers and  types of foster hom es and other \nplacements, which results in the predictable cycling of children through numerous inappropriate \nand too often dangerous foster care placements. \n110.  Because of a severe sho rtage of foster care placements, an overburdened \nand insufficiently supported staff, and the abse nce of an appropriate and tim ely administered \nprocess for assessing th e needs of foster child ren, Plaintiff children who enter foster care in \nNebraska are routinely placed without regard to their specific needs or the training and capacity \n  -33-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 34 of 65 - Page ID # 431\n \nof the foster paren ts or other caretakers with  whom they are p laced.  Instead, P laintiffs are \nregularly placed wherever a bed or “slot” is available.   \n111.  HHS of ten f ails to  c ollect or  mainta in th e inf ormation necessa ry to \nproperly match Plaintiff children with foster care homes or other placements.  For example, as of \nMarch 2004, only 18% of the foster parent r ecords contained inform ation regarding the \ncharacteristics of a child that the foster pare nts would accept into their hom e, and only 16% of \nthe foster children’s records contained information about the children’s characteristics. \n112.  HHS caseworkers routinely place Pl aintiff children in foster hom es \nwithout providing the foster parents with adequate information concerning the children’s medical \nand mental health history and needs, and without  preparing the foster parents to deal with the \npredictable behaviors and treatm ent needs of th e children placed in th eir homes.  As a result, \nfoster parents are frequently unaware of and unequipped to meet Plaintiff children’s needs.  HHS \ncaseworkers are also often unresponsive to fost er parents’ requests for additional support or \ninformation about foster children placed with them.   \n113.  For foster children with needs that requir e intensive services or, in rar e \ncases, placement in group or instit utional settings that can provi de an even higher level of  \ntreatment and care, HHS consistently does not provide such serv ices or placements unless and \nuntil the children “fail” in  the less-supported (and less expensive) placements, those placements \ndisrupt, and those children suffer unnecessary and damaging additional placement moves.  This \nde facto requirement of “failure” before needed services and placements are provided is severely \ndamaging to Plaintiff children.  \n114.  HHS’ pattern and practice of placing children wherever a bed is available \ninstead of based on their individua l needs, failing to develop a nd maintain appropriate foster \n  -34-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 35 of 65 - Page ID # 432\n \nhomes and other placem ents, failing to provide fo ster parents with sufficient preparation or \ninformation, and failing to prov ide children with expensive services and placement absent prior \nplacement d isruptions o r oth er failures, resu lts  in a high  rate of psy chologically damaging \nplacement disruptions, with Plaintiff children bei ng repeatedly and unnecessarily shuffled from \none placement to another.  For example, HHS  reported to the federal governm ent that from \nOctober 2003 to Septem ber 2004, approxim ately  47% of the children in foster care had \nexperienced three or more placements and approximately 32% of Nebraska’s foster children had \nexperienced four or more placem ents.  In the 2004 FCRB2 Report, the Board stated that, of the \nfiles reviewed of children who were in “out-o f-home” foster care placement at the end of 2003, \nclose to 50% experienced four or more placem ent disruptions, and 33% had experienced six or  \nmore placement disruptions while in foster care.  The Board expressed special concern about the \nnumber of placements experienced by pre-school age children, who can be particularly damaged \nby multiple broken attachm ents with care giv ers.  Of the files rev iewed of pr e-school age \nchildren who were in “out-of-home” foster placement at the end of 2003, about 38% had lived in \nthree or more different homes, and about 12% had lived in five or more homes.   \n115.  Compounding the harm done to Plainti ff children from  being shuffled \nfrom one placement to another, it is commonplace for HHS to move a child from a foster home \nabruptly without attempting to provide supportive services to either prevent the placement from \ndisrupting or at least minimize the trauma of yet another change in a child’s primary caregiver.  \n                                                 \n2 The Nebraska Foster Care Review Board was created in 1982 pursuant to the Foster Care Review Act.  Neb. Rev. \nStat. § 43-1301 et seq.  Among other statutory duties, the board is charged with (i) establishing and training local \nfoster care review boards for the conduct of six-month permanency review hearings for children in out-of-home \nstate custody, and (ii) accumulating data and making reports on children in out-of-home placements to HHS and the \njuvenile courts.  The FCRB is also authorized to visit and observe foster care facilities in order to ascertain whether \nthe individual physical, psychological, and sociological needs of each foster child are being met.  See Neb. Rev. \nStat. §§ 1303-1308.  \n  -35-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 36 of 65 - Page ID # 433\n \n116.  Each placement move by a foster child  forces that child to seek to  form \nnew attachments with adult caregivers.  Plaintiff children who suffer multiple placement moves \nfrequently become increasingly reluctant to lov e and trus t their ca retakers, suffer behavioral \nproblems, and become more difficult to place in  permanent homes.  Additionally, the frequent \nplacement moves experienced by Plai ntiff children d irectly interfere with their education,  as \nmany of these unnecess ary placement moves result in  school changes, delays in th e transfer of \nschool records, and delays in enrollment and unnecessary absences from school.   \n117.  Because of an insufficient num ber and array o f available foster hom es, \nDefendants often rely on unsafe and inappropriate placements for the care of Plaintiff children , \nincluding inadequately screened and m onitored public (or “traditional”) foster hom es directly \nadministered by HHS; relative foster hom es, also under the direct supervision of HHS; hom es \nrecruited by agencies that c ontract with HHS; and hom es and group or institutional placements \nrecruited and overseen by private providers.   \n118.  There is an  acute sho rtage in Nebras ka of the therap eutic foster hom es \nneeded to accommodate child ren with emotional or beh avioral problems.  Because HHS has \nfailed to develop, train and support a sufficient num ber of therapeutic foster homes, Plaintiff \nchildren are routinely placed in settings that  are unable to  meet their needs and where they  \nendanger their own development and safety as well as the safety of the other children with whom \nthey are placed (inclu ding other foster child ren and foster paren ts’ biological and adoptive \nchildren).   \n119.  In addition to the harm  directly inflicted upon  Plaintiff children by the \nemotional trauma caused by each placem ent move, HHS’ failu re to match these children with \nhomes appropriate to their needs results in even longer stays in foster care for these children, and \n  -36-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 37 of 65 - Page ID # 434\n \nfurther harm, as the emotional and behavioral  effects of the pla cement moves significantly \ndecreases their chances of ever being placed in a permanent home.  \n120.  The severe lack of foster hom es also results in HHS pla cing Plaintiff \nchildren for extended periods of time in emergency shelters that are intended only for very short \nstays.  In addition to failing to provide stab ility, these shelter placements often fail to provid e \nchildren with adequate treatm ent services and fa il to provide even rudimentary safety, as they \noften house together children of diverse ages and maturity levels, including youth who have been \nadjudicated to be delinquent with non-offenders  and children with aggressive physical or sexual \nbehaviors with very young a nd vulnerable children.  Alt hough these em ergency shelter \nplacements are intended  to be tem porary and to  last no more th an 30 days, Plain tiff children \nfrequently remain for far longer periods – sometimes for four months or more – because the State \nhas nowhere else to place th em and also, in some cases, because staff  are too overwhelmed to \neven determine what placements are available for them.   \n121.  In addition to the inappropriate use of shelters for all children, very young \nfoster children (including infants and toddlers) are regu larly placed in emergency shelters and \nother temporary facilities, again because appropriate foster care placements are unavailable or in \nsome cases because staff are too overwhelmed to locate them.  The State’s data indicates that in \nthe month of April 2005 alone, m ore than 300 separate foster ch ildren spent time in emergency \nshelters in Nebraska.  The average age of children residing in shelters was 13.45 years, reflecting \nthe fact that a number of children staying in these facilities were in fact significantly younger.  In \nthe Northern Service Area the average age of children that spent time in shelters was 11.19 years, \na product o f that regio n’s regu lar placem ent  of infants and other very young children in  \nsheltercare.  HHS’ care of young child ren forming critical bonds and  developmental skills \n  -37-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 38 of 65 - Page ID # 435\n \nthrough shifts of caretakers in gro up facilities such as shelters or  crisis nurseries is severely \ndamaging to these children.   \n122.  As a result of the lack of hom es and other placements for foster children, \nfoster homes are regularly overcrowded and m ay include six or even  more Plaintiff children, \nexclusive of biological and adoptive children li ving in the hom e.  Such overcrowding often \nprevents adequate parental supervision and places children at risk of harm.  \n123.  Another result of HHS’ failure to d evelop and retain a sufficient num ber \nand array of foster homes is that Plaintiff childre n are often regularly placed in institutions and \nother congregate facilities when they could be  appropriately placed with  appropriately trained \nand supported foster families.  HHS also conti nues to place young Plaintiff children (includ ing \nchildren under eight y ears of age) in non -family setti ngs.  Such children are denied \nindividualized treatment and one-on-one relationsh ips with a consis tent caregiver by virtue of \ntheir institutionalization.  As the m ost common source of adoptive parents is foster parents, the \nState’s placement of Plaintiff children in institutions  decreases the likelihood  that they will be \nadopted. \n124.  Defendants devote few resources to re cruiting and retaining foster hom es \nfor Plaintiff children and pay foster parents caring for Plaintiff children only a fraction of what it \ncosts to actually raise those children.   \n125.  As it is legally obligated to do, Nebraska provides foster care maintenance \npayments for the direct and intended benefit of  most foster ch ildren in the state’s custody .  \nHowever, these foster care maintenance payments are not set based on the actual and reasonable \ncosts and individual needs of the children themselves and are insufficient to provide essential and \nappropriate care and services to Plaintiff children.  For instance, HHS pays many foster parents \n  -38-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 39 of 65 - Page ID # 436\n \nonly $222 a m onth – less than $8 a day – to raise  a newborn to two-year-old child, when the  \nfederal government estimates that it costs an average family $755 a month to raise a child of that \nage in the rural United States and $761 a mont h for the urban Midwestern United States.   \nNebraska’s $222 basic ra te is the lowest foster m aintenance payment in the country.   The \nexceedingly low rates paid to foster parents taking care of the State’s  most vulnerable child ren \ninterfere with HHS’ ability to  recruit and r etain f oster and adoptive f amilies f or Plaintif f \nchildren. \n126.  Similarly, the rates paid on behalf of Plaintiff children placed with private \nproviders – including som e of the state’s mo st damaged and vulnerable children – are not \nestablished based on the actual needs of children and the reasonable cost of caring for them.  The \nfoster care maintenance payments provided for children placed with private providers, including \nthose in non-family settings, are insufficient to provide appropriate care and services to Plaintiff \nchildren.    \n127.  Plaintiff children are re gularly placed with foster parents to whom  HHS \ndenies basic supportive services, such as appropriate respite care.  Additionally, HHS often fails \nto respond to foster parents’ requests for assistance with services and instead often simply moves \nPlaintiff children rather than prov iding services and supports to p revent impending placement \ndisruptions.   \n128.  In addition to the Plaintiff children that HHS places in “out-of-home” care, \nthere are approxim ately 1,500 children in the le gal custody of HHS w ho reside with their \nbiological parents or other caretakers, most of them on trial reunifications following stays in non-\nrelative foster hom es or other placem ents.  As  with the ch ildren in “ou t-of-home” care, these \n  -39-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 40 of 65 - Page ID # 437\n \nchildren are insufficiently m onitored and visi ted by HHS and are denied needed services, \nincluding mental health services.   \n129.  Far too often Plaintiff children brought into Nebraska’s foster care custody \nbecause of abuse or neglect at the hands of th eir own biological parents or other caregivers are \nsubject to further abuse, neglect and other m altreatment and harmful conditions while in the \ncustody of the State.  T his maltreatment occurs because of HHS’ failure to appropriately screen \nand oversee foster homes, segregate sexually react ive children (often themselves the victims of \nprior sexual abuse) or physically  aggressive children from other foster children, and adequately \nmonitor and supervise visits between foster children and their biological family members when \nproblems that have not been addressed place children at risk of harm.   \n130.  Through the pattern and practice of s ubjecting Plaintiffs to placement \npractices that are emotionally, psychologically and even physically injurious to them, Defendants \nhave acted and continue to act with deliberate indifference to their welfare and in clear departure \nfrom any reasonable exercise of professional judgment.  This pattern and practice of conduct has \ncaused, and is causing, direct and severe harm to Plaintiff children.   \nHigh Caseloads, Turnover and Inadequate Training \n \n131.  Defendants routinely fail to hire  and retain a sufficient num ber of \ncaseworkers necessary to ensure Plaintiff child ren are provided the care and services to which \nthey are legally entitled.   \n132.  National standards provide that foster  care caseworkers be responsible for \nno more than 12 to 15 foster children.  HHS  caseworkers responsible for Plaintiff children \nroutinely carry caseloads dangerously in excess  of those standards.  In som e regions, child \nwelfare caseworker caseloads are ro utinely several times the nation al standard and som etimes \n  -40-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 41 of 65 - Page ID # 438\n \nrequire caseworkers to be responsible for – and a ttempt to ensure the safe ty of – more than 50 \nPlaintiff children at one time.    \n133.  High caseloads and a lack of support  have led to a high caseworker and \nsupervisor attrition rate.  Especially in urban areas, caseworkers frequently leave after working  \nfor HHS for only one or two year s, and m any leave well before  that tim e.  Among childr en \nreviewed in the 2004 FCRB Report, nearly 60% had  four or more caseworkers while in foster \ncare.  Frontline staff, who ar e charged with making critical  decisions about a child including \nwhere the child will live, are frequently you ng and inexperienced and, as a result, often \nunequipped to make decisions that comport with any reasonable  professional judgment.  As a \nresult of high attrition in the supervisor rank s, supervisory staff responsible for overseeing \ncaseworkers are often them selves inexperienced, having been prem aturely promoted to cover \nvacant positions.  Supervisors are also often distr acted from their supervisory duties by the need \nfor them to carry caseloads of foster children pending the replacement and training of departed \ncaseworkers.    \n134.  The high turnover rate denies Plai ntiff children the appropriate and \nconsistent services, stable placements and case planning that are essen tial to their safety and  \nwell-being and to preventing them from languishing in state custody without perm anent homes.  \nEssential information about Plaintiff children and their cases – including such things as how well \nparticular children are adjusting to new foster ho mes, whether parent-child visits are helpful or \nharmful to particular children, or even what e fforts the biological parents have made towards \nreunification – is lost because of caseworker turnover, attendant rebalancing of caseloads within \nHHS units, and th e lack of effective comm unication between incom ing and departing or  \notherwise transitioning workers.   \n  -41-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 42 of 65 - Page ID # 439\n \n135.  These problems unduly prolong the tim e Plaintiff childre n stay in state \ncustody, as was recognized in a statewide “self-assessment” which HHS submitted to the federal \ngovernment in 2002 as part of its federal audit,  which listed caseworker turnover as one of the  \nbarriers towards timely moving children towards a doption.  This self-assessment also identified \nturnover and high caseloads as impacting HH S’ ability to com plete case plans in a tim ely \nfashion.  These deficiencies persist today.   \n136.  Compounding the problem s of turnover  and high caseloads, the training \nprovided by HHS to child welfare caseworkers fails to adequately prepare the workers for the job \ncritical functions of overseeing the safety, well-being and permanency of Plaintiff children.    \n137.  Through the pattern and practice of failing to hire, retain, train and support \nfront-line staff sufficient to m eet the needs of  Plaintiffs, Defendants have acted and continue to \nact with deliberate indif ference to their welf are and in clear depart ure from any reasonable \nexercise of professional judgm ent. This pattern and practice of conduct has caused, and is \ncausing, direct and severe harm to Plaintiff children.   \nPoor Monitoring of Child Safety  \n \n138.  Defendants often fail to  take basic screening precautions before Plaintiff \nchildren are placed in foster homes and other placements and fail to monitor Plaintiff children’s \nsafety and well-being once in their placements.   \n139.  HHS routinely fails to conduct documented assessments of the safety of a \nhome in which it has placed a foster ch ild, or to consistently conduct criminal and child abuse \nbackground checks on the people it relies upon to care for foster children.  For example, the 2004 \nFCRB Report found that in over 25% of the cases re viewed, children were placed in homes that \nwere unsafe, inappropriate, or had never undergone a documented safety assessment.  In 19% of \n  -42-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 43 of 65 - Page ID # 440\n \nthe cases reviewed by the Board, there was no cl ear indication that a com plete assessment was \nconducted of the foster child’s safety in the child’s current placement.  \n140.  HHS also fails to ad equately lic ense and o therwise ov ersee p rivate \nproviders with whom  it contracts f or the provisi on of group and institutional foster care to \nPlaintiff children.  L icensing inspections of su ch facilities are typ ically performed only once \nevery other year, usually on an announced basis, and fail to identify staff and conditions that put \nPlaintiff children at risk  of ha rm.  Such procedures are n ot in accord with nation al standards \nregarding the licensing of such facilities.    \n141.  Compounding the danger to children, HHS ca seworkers responsible for \nPlaintiff children often fail to consistently visit the children assigned to them for long periods of \ntime, placing these children at serious risk of harm.   \n142.  Regular visitation is essential to de termining, among other things, foster  \nchildren’s safety, their treatment and service needs, their progress in moving toward a permanent \nhome and the continued appropriateness of their current placements.  HHS itself has determined \nthat foster care caseworkers are req uired to vi sit each of th e children  on their caseload every \nthirty days.   \n143.  Nevertheless, Plaintiff children go  long periods without seeing their \ncaseworkers.  One of the findings m ade by the United States Department of Health and Hum an \nServices Administration for Children and Fam ilies during a 2002 aud it of Nebras ka’s child \nwelfare system was that “the frequency and quality of face-to-face contact between caseworkers \nand the children and parents in their caseloads was often insufficient to monitor children’s safety \nor promote attainment of case goals.”  These deficiencies remain today.  For example, state data \nreports show that, for the month of March 2005, approximately 30% of foster children statewide \n  -43-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 44 of 65 - Page ID # 441\n \ndid not receive a required m onthly contact from their caseworker.  In the Eastern Service Area \n(which includes Omaha), approximately 45% of children did not receive required monthly visits \nduring March 2005.  In the 2004 FCRB Report, the Board found that 526 foster children in “out-\nof-home” placement had no documenta tion in their case record to  indicate that th ey had been  \nseen by their caseworker even once in the previous 60 days.   \n144.  Defendants inappropriately “contract  out” essential casework duties such \nas monitoring visitation between Plaintiff child ren and their biological  parents and conducting \nhome visits.  These vitally important caseworker tasks are not adequately monitored by HHS and \nthe actual supervision is ofte n undertaken by cycling workers with m inimal training and only \nlimited knowledge of the children and parents whos e visits they a re supervising.  Essential \ninformation about Plaintiff children, such as how  well particular children are adjusting to new \nfoster homes or whether parent-child visits are helpful or harmful  to particular children, is often \nlost because the con tract workers supervising visitation did not  have the training to properly \nassess the situation or because of a lack of communication and coordination between and among \nthe foster care caseworker and the contract worker or workers.  \n145.  In its 2004 Report, the Foster Care Review Board documented some of the \nproblems created by Defendants’ reliance on substa ndard and unmonitored contract agents.  For \nexample, in some cases, foster children were tr ansported by a contract provider for supervised \nparent-child visits for weeks befo re the caseworker or the foster parents were inform ed that the \nparents were not even attending the visits.  At  least one contract agency upon which Defendants \nrely to trans port and supervise parent-child visits prohibited its em ployees from disclosing to \nHHS caseworkers any negative interactions that occurred during those visits. \n  -44-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 45 of 65 - Page ID # 442\n \n146.  Far too often private agency staff contracted to transport Plaintiff children \nto visitations fail to ensure that children are properly restrained in car seats, putting such children \nat risk of severe injury.    \n147.  Defendants continue the pattern and  practice of failing to appropriately \nscreen foster homes and failing to supervise the Plaintiff children in their custody despite the risk \nit poses for and harm it inflicts upon the children they are charged with protecting.  Defendants’ \nfailure to adequately monitor Plaintiff children is a departure from  any reasonable exercise of \nprofessional judgment and is in deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs’ safety and well-being.  This \npattern and practice of conduct has  caused, and is causing , direct and severe  harm to Plaintiff \nchildren. \nA Lack of Basic Health Services for Foster Children \n \n148.  Defendants often fail to  ensure that Plaintiff children in HHS custody \nreceive adequate health care services, including mental health, medical and dental care.   \n149.  Adequate health services are critical to ensuring that foster children do not \ndeteriorate while in state custody.  Health services are particularly important to foster children, as \nabused and neglected children who enter foster car e frequently have more serious health care \nneeds, stemming from the circumstances that resulted in their placement into state custody and \nthe trauma of being removed from what is often the only home they have ever known.  \n150.  For those Plaintiff children who need  higher levels of medical and mental \nhealth services, Defendants have elected to co ntract with Magellan Health Se rvices, a pr ivate \nbehavioral health organization, to provide intensive care m anagement services.  Personnel from \nMagellan rarely, if ever, visit with children, typically making their determinations as to the needs \nof Plaintiff children solely on the basis of superficial paper reviews.  Magellan frequently denies \n  -45-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 46 of 65 - Page ID # 443\n \nrequests that foster children be provided higher-level treatment (and placement in the facilities in \nwhich such treatment can be provided) based on  cost and without regard for diagnoses of need \nfor such treatm ent and placem ents.  Mag ellan al so term inates m ental health services an d \nplacements prematurely based on cost and regardless of the child’s actual continuing need.  HHS \nusually simply accep ts such decisio ns by Magellan, and do es not challenge them  through the \nadministrative appeals process.  As  a result of the denial or pr emature termination of critical \nmental health serv ices, the m ental health of  Plaintiff children furth er deteriorates and their \nplacements disrupt m ore frequently, decreasing the likelih ood that th e children will ever b e \nplaced in stable and permanent homes. \n151.  Plaintiff children, especially in the western and northern areas of the State, \nare regularly denied access to m edical and mental health services in proximity to their hom es, \noften because relevant service prov iders are lo cated across state lines .  Plaintiff children are  \neither denied any access to health professionals  or are required to spend hours traveling across \nthe State to receive services, including regularly needed services such as weekly counseling. \n152.  In addition to receiv ing deficient mental health services, Nebraska foster \nchildren are often denied required periodic m edical and dental screening exam inations and \ntreatment.  Plaintiff children are also frequently denied timely and adequate dental care.  This is \ndue, at least in part, to a severe shortage of de ntal care providers willing to accept Medicaid in \nNebraska, coupled with Defendants’ failure to  make alternative funding arrangements for dental \nservices. \n153.  In addition to deficiencies in the deli very of health care serv ices, critical \nmedical and mental health information about individual Plaintiff children is often not passed on \nto foster parents and other caretakers, thereby placing the health of those children in jeopardy.  \n  -46-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 47 of 65 - Page ID # 444\n \n154.  Defendants’ pattern and practice of  denying Plaintiff c hildren needed \nmental health services and other medical and dental care subjects them to unnecessary harm and \ncontinued risk of harm, and amounts to a departure from any reasonable exercise of professional \njudgment and deliberate indifference to Plaintif fs’ health, safety and well-being.  This pattern \nand practice of conduct has caused, and is causing, direct and severe harm to Plaintiff children. \nPlanning and Services Inadequate to Move Children \nOut of Foster Care and Into Permanent Homes  \n \n155.  Reasonable professional judgm ent and  applicable law di ctate that the \nplacement of a child in foster care must be temporary.  Foster children and their families must be \nprovided with planning and services necessary for the children to be promptly returned to the  \ncustody of their parents or other caretakers, when  it is safe to do so.  When it is not safe or  \nappropriate for children to be “reun ified” with their own families, foster children must receive \nprompt efforts to find them an alternative permanent home, typically through adoption. \n156.  In Nebraska, foster children do not  receive this m andated “permanency \nplanning” and related services.  Instead, Plain tiff children are spending significant portions of \ntheir lives growing up in state custody.  In its  2002 review of the Nebras ka foster care system, \nthe federal government identified HHS’ failure to  establish appropriate perm anency goals and \nachieve adoptions in a timely manner as “critical problems.”  Because Defendants have failed to \naddress these problems, children continue to linger in state cu stody unnecessarily, at significant \ncost to their health and well-being.  \n157.  Plaintiff children remain in f oster care for unn ecessarily long periods of \ntime because HHS fails to take even the m ost rudimentary steps to p lan for how a child is to  \nachieve a permanent home.   A child’s case plan is key to a child achieving such permanency, as \nit sets forth the plan for either reunifying the child with his or her biological parents or, when that \n  -47-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 48 of 65 - Page ID # 445\n \nis not possible, for moving the child to a safe and permanent alternative home, and designates the \nservices necessary for the child to atta in that goal.  Despite the clear importance o f case plans, \nand the statutory obligation to create and implement them, HHS frequently fails to either prepare \nor implement case plans in an adequate or timely manner.   \n158.  The federal government, in its 2002 a udit, expressed concern over HHS’ \nmany failures in developing case pl ans and in involving parents in  the case planning process.   \nThe failure to develop timely and adequate case plans remains a critical problem.  In its m ost \nrecent report, the Foster Care Review Board found that in 30% of the cases reviewed, the foster \nchild either had no current case plan, or the existing plan was incomplete.  The State’s own data \nreflect that in the month of March 2005, more than 30% of the children in custody did not have a \ncurrent case plan.  And data subm itted by HHS to the fe deral government in 2004 reflects that \n1,062 children (13.27%) in state custody had no established permanency goal.   \n159.  In the absence of a permanency goal and case plan for achieving that goal, \nPlaintiff children’s stays in foster care are unnecessarily prolonged.  Often, biological parents do \nnot know or do not understand what they m ust do to secure their child’s return home or are not \nprovided services necessary for them  to attain  those goals.  In cases in which parents are not  \nmaking efforts to be reunified with their children, there is often no documentation upon which to \nbuild a case  for the ter mination of their pa rental rights, a required step before a child can be \nadopted.   \n160.  In thos e cases in  which case plan s  are completed, they often contain \n“boiler-plate” language and are de void of individualized assessm ents regarding the needs and \ncircumstances of children.  Thus, HHS’ policy is  to initially assign  a  goal of return hom e to \nevery child who enters foster care, regard less of the child’s family history.  Despite the heav y \n  -48-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 49 of 65 - Page ID # 446\n \nreliance on reunification as a perm anency goal, critical services for biologi cal parents, such as \nsubstance abuse counseling, often are not available, even though HHS identified them as \nnecessary for the safe return of a child to his or her biological parents.   \n161.  Caseworkers f ail to regular ly an d consisten tly m eet with biolog ical \nparents, as they are required to do in order to assist and assess the parents’ progress in achieving \nthe goal of reunification.  In March 2005, caseworke rs of Plaintiff children made required visits \nwith the biological families of the children on their caseload less than half of the time, and only a \nthird of the time in the Eastern Service Area.  HHS’ failure to adequately and consistently work \nwith biological parents toward  reunification and to provide acce ss to services to assist in \nreunification, often unnecessarily prolongs Plaintiff  children’s stays in foster care and deprives \nthem of family relationships and the opportunity to be reunified. \n162.  In many cases, HHS makes no effort to  have Plaintiff children’s initial \ngoal of reunification changed to adoption (or in se lect cases, to another appropriate permanency \noption) until long after it  is clear that a child wi ll never be able to return hom e safely and well \nbeyond the statutory timeframes mandating that the child’s goal be changed.  According to 2004 \nstatistics, only 9.87% of Nebraska’s foster  care population had a perm anency goal of adoption, \nwhen the national rate is approxi mately 20%.  While children get older waiting for their goal to \nbe changed to adoptio n, many develop behav ioral problems associated with m ultiple moves, \nyears of uncertainty about their future, and othe r harms experienced while in foster care, and  \nmany are no longer good candidates for adoption.  \n163.  HHS also regular ly recommends the return of  Plaintiff children to th eir \nbiological families, often on trial reunifications,  without ensuring their safety, without having  \nprovided needed services to such fam ilies, and without h aving assessed whether th e problems \n  -49-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 50 of 65 - Page ID # 447\n \nthat led to the entry of such children into foster care have been addressed.  As a result, too many \nPlaintiff children who are reun ified with their  biological families return to f oster care af ter \nexperiencing further maltreatment.  For example, the FCRB 2004 Report indicates that just under \n40% of the foster children who were in “out-of-home” care at the end 2003 had returned to State \ncustody due to abuse or neglect after one or more failed reunification attempts. \n164.  HHS routin ely recomm ends that Pl aintiff childr en a ttend biological \nparent-child visits even when such visits are clearly emotionally injurious to a child because the \nparent’s attendance at the visits is erratic, or because the parent fails to engage with the child in \nan appropriate m anner.  Too often HHS caseworke rs are unaware of what tran spires at th ese \nvisits because the supervision of the visits has been contracted out to private agency workers, and \ncritical information is not passed on to the  HHS workers with principal responsibility for the \ncase.  \n165.  In those cases in which it is determ ined that reunification is no longer an \nappropriate goal for a Plaintiff  child, HHS frequently fails to begin the process necessary to \npermit termination of the paren tal rights of th e biological parents in accordan ce with federal  \nstatutory timeframes.   In its review of Nebraska’s child welfare system, the federal government \nnoted as a “key concern ” that the State was failing to free children for adoption in accordan ce \nwith the time frames established by federal law.  Nebraska stakeholders involved with the federal \nreview noted that it was “rare” fo r HHS to seek to free a child for adoption.  This deficiency  \ncontinues today. \n166.  Even on those occas ions when HHS d ecides to free a Plain tiff child for  \nadoption, the process is often unnecessarily p rolonged because HHS first seeks to term inate the \nrights of the biological mother.  Only after th at is accomplished does HHS begin the process of \n  -50-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 51 of 65 - Page ID # 448\n \nterminating the rights of  the f ather.  In m any instances, it is only when HHS is preparing to \nterminate the rights of a biolog ical mother that HHS begins the search  for m issing biological \nfathers.  If the father is located, HHS may start the lengthy pro cess of attempting to reunify the \nfoster child and m issing father, regardless of how  long the child has been in foster care.  Only \nafter this process has been exhausted does HHS seek to move a child to adoption. \n167.  By failing to locate and involve missing fathers at the outset of a case, and \nby later no t seek ing to term inate the rights   of both parents sim ultaneously, months, and \nfrequently years go by, during which tim e opportunities for a perm anent home are lost and \nPlaintiff children are left in limbo, not knowing if they will ever find a permanent home.   \n168.  HHS also regularly fails to identify in a timely fashion relatives who are \nwilling and able to provide appropriate care for Plaintiff children at the time they enter the foster \ncare system.  Instead, HHS frequently waits until  a child has been in the foster care system  for \nmonths and sometimes years before it looks to identify relatives who may be available to care for \ntheir kin in f oster care.  In  some instances a se arch for relatives does not even begin until the \nchild has been in custody so long that he or she is in the process of being freed for adoption.  If a \nrelative is located f or a child at tha t late juncture, HHS often rem oves the child from  a foster \nhome and p laces the ch ild with the relative, rega rdless of how long th e child has lived in the \nfoster home or if the foster parents are ready, willing and able to adopt the child, and irrespective \nof whether the child has ever had any contact with the relative prior to entering foster care.  The \nfrequent practice of uprooting children from stable foster families that have bonded with and are \nwilling to adopt particu lar children and placing those ch ildren into the homes of relatives wh o \nare virtual strangers to them, is often psychologically damaging.  \n  -51-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 52 of 65 - Page ID # 449\n \n169.  In those cases in which HHS seeks to change a child’s goal to adoption \nand the child’s parental rights are term inated in order for the child to be adopted, it takes well  \nover three years, on average, from the child’s entry into care for an adoption to be finalized, an \nenormous portion of any child’s life.  In fiscal year 2004, only 15% of those children who exited \nfoster care to a finalized adop tion did so within 24 m onths of  coming into f oster care.  The \nnational standard on this m easure is 32%, m ore than double HHS’ perform ance on this critical \nbenchmark. \n170.  The routin e delays in  accom plishing adoptions of foster children  in \nNebraska are harmful and unnecessary because,  as the federal governm ent noted in its audit of \nNebraska’s foster care system, they are principally attributable to ineffective casework practice, \nrather than any external factors.  Poor casework includes the unnecessary delays described above \nand the failure to transfer cases in a tim ely manner to the adoption unit responsible for placing \nchildren in permanent homes (in the few areas that  have such specialized adoption units) or to \nprivate agencies with whom HHS contracts for adoption services, and the failure to list children \navailable for adoption on either the state or na tional adoption exchanges  that allow prospective \nadoptive parents to identify children whom  they might be interested in adopting.  Although, in \nSeptember 2004, HHS reported to the federal gove rnment that there we re over 700 children in \nstate custody with the goal of adoption, as of  March 2005 only 161 were residing in what HHS \nidentified as pre-adoptive homes.  Though there are many hundreds of children with the goal of \nadoption for whom HHS has not identified an  adoptive home, as of Septem ber 2005, only 45 \nfoster children were listed on the State’s public adoption exchange website.  \n171.  There are a number of Plaintiff children in foster care for whom Nebraska \nsimply has given up trying to find a perm anent home.  In 2004, the State reported that over 130 \n  -52-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 53 of 65 - Page ID # 450\n \nfoster children had a perm anency goal of “l ong term  foster care”  and 488 had a goal of \n“emancipation from foster care.”  This means that HHS has no plan for these children other than \nthat they will grow up in foster care and, at  or around age 19, be left to fend for them selves \nwithout ever having had the opportunity to grow  up in a perm anent and loving hom e.  Of \nparticular concern is HHS’ inappr opriate practice of attaching goa ls such as “long term  foster \ncare” even to very young children under six years old. \n172.  Plaintiff children are also frequently  denied relationships with siblings.   \nChildren who enter State custody with siblings  are often separated from  them and placed in \ndifferent foster homes.  HHS also routinely fails to ensure that foster children who are separated \nfrom their siblings have regular opportunities to visit them.  As a result, HHS interferes with and \ndamages these critical family relationships. \n173.  Defendants are legally obligated to provide independent living services to \nthose foster youth ages 16 and older who cannot be returned home or adopted in order to prepare \nthem to live on their own upon discharge from foster care.  HHS has failed to adequately develop \nor make accessible an adequate array of such independent living services.  As a result, every year \nPlaintiff children are emancipated from the foster care system without the life skills necessary to \nfunction in society.  Many of th ese foster care “gradu ates” go  on to enter the ranks of the \nunemployed, the incarcerated and the homeless.   \n174.  Defendants’ pattern and practice of allowing children to languish for long \nperiods of time in foster care,  failing to provide adequate pla nning and services for children’s \nplacement into permanent homes, separating foster children from their siblings and denying them \nopportunities to maintain family relationships, and failing to provide adequate services to allow \nchildren to  live indep endently w hen they a re disch arged f rom state cus tody, despite th e \n  -53-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 54 of 65 - Page ID # 451\n \nknowledge that such practices subject children to psychological harm and make them more likely \nto develop behavioral problems, is in deliberate  indifference to Plaintiff children’s welfare, and \nis well outside the bounds of any reasonable exercise of professional judgment.  This pattern and \npractice of conduct has caused, and is causing, direct and severe harm to Plaintiff children. \nFiscal Waste \n175.  Nebraska regularly fails to collect  available federal funds for foster \nchildren in State custody, foregoing millions of dollars that could be used to provide desperately \nneeded homes and services for Plaintiff children.   \n176.  Nebraska h as en tered into  a State  Plan cont ract with t he feder al \ngovernment pursuant to Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, under which the State is entitled to \nreceive certain federal monies in exchange fo r the State’ s compliance with vario us federal \nrequirements pertaining to foster care and adopti on assistance.  Yet Nebras ka routinely fails to \ncollect available federal funds for the care of fo ster children and, in f act, collects Title IV-E  \nfederal funds for only between 20 and 30% of th e foster children in “o ut-of-home” care in the \nState, about half the national average. \n177.  HHS also f ails to sp end all of  th e m onies appropriated to it by the  \nlegislature for maintenance of the State’s child welfare system. \n178.  Defendants’ pattern and practice of fa ilure to obtain and expend available \nmonies on behalf of Plaintiff children in desperate need of appropriate placements and services is \ninconsistent with the reasonable exercise of professional judgment and in deliberate indifference \nto Plaintiffs’ safety and well-being.  This pa ttern and practice of cond uct has caused, and is \ncausing, direct and severe harm to Plaintiff children.  \nPoor Information Management Systems \n \n  -54-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 55 of 65 - Page ID # 452\n \n179.  Defendants have failed to develop an information management system that \nis capable of meeting the needs of HHS caseworke rs and the Plaintiff children they serve.  The \ndata in the State ’s primary child welfare database, N-FOCUS, is often outdated or incorrect, \nimpeding the ability  of  caseworke rs, superv isors and m anagement sta ff to m ake inf ormed \ndecisions for Plaintiff children. \nBreach of State Plan Contracts \n180.  The federal governm ent has appro ved the State Plans s ubmitted b y \nNebraska in order to receive federal financial assistance under Titles IV-B and IV-E of the Social \nSecurity Act to help fund the State’s child welf are, foster care and ad option programs.  These \nState Plans are contracts into wh ich the State of Nebraska ente rs for the express and direct \nbenefit of Plaintiff children, who are third-party beneficiaries of these contracts.  Defendants are \ndirectly responsible for fulfilli ng the obligations undertaken by Nebraska when it entered into  \nthese State Plan contracts, including but not limited to the obligation to administer the programs \nin accordance with specific relevant state statutes, regulations, policies and all applicable federal \nstatutes, regulations and other official issuances of the United States Departm ent of Health and \nHuman Services.   \n181.  Defendants have breached their obligations to P laintiffs under these State \nPlan contracts. \nCAUSES OF ACTION BROUGHT PURSUANT TO 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nFirst Cause of Action – Substantive Due Process \n182.  Each and every allegation of the Complaint is incorpora ted as if fully set \nforth herein. \n  -55-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 56 of 65 - Page ID # 453\n \n183.  The foregoing actions and inactions of the Defendants amount to a pattern, \npractice, or custom of failu re to exercise reasonable professional judg ment and of deliberate \nindifference to Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, and are the cause of  the violation of such rights.   \nAs a result of Defendants’ conduc t, Plaintiffs have been and  are being severe ly harmed and \ndeprived of the substantive  due process rights conferre d upon them  by the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United State s Constitution.  These rights includ e, but are not lim ited to, \nPlaintiffs’ right to protection from harm; their right not to deteriorate or be harmed – physically, \nemotionally or developm entally – while in state custody; their  right not to rem ain in state  \ncustody unnecessarily; their right to be housed in  the least restrictiv e, most appropriate and \nfamily-like placement while in state custody; their  right to treatment and services related to th e \ncause of their confinement; and their right to receive care, treatment and services consistent with \nreasonable professional judgment.  \nSecond Cause of Action – Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act \n184.  Each and every allegation of the Complaint is incorpora ted as if fully set \nforth herein. \n185.  Under the Adoption Assistance a nd Child Welfare Act of 1980 as \namended by the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, 42 U.S.C. '' 620-29(i), 670-679b (the \n“Act”), states receive certain federal reimbursements so long as they enter into a plan approved  \nby the federal Department of Health and Human Services and comply with its terms.  Nebraska \nreceives federal funding under the Act and has submitted and entered into such a plan, which is a \nlegal contract between the federa l government and the State, th ereby agreeing to provide child  \nwelfare services in accordance with the Act. \n  -56-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 57 of 65 - Page ID # 454\n \n186.  As a result of the foregoing actions  and inactions of the Defendants, the \nDefendants are engaging in a policy, pattern, practice or custom of depriving Plaintiffs the rights \nindividually conferred upon them  by the Act and the regulations  promulgated thereunder (45 \nC.F.R.

Each and every allegation of the Complaint is incorpora ted as if fully set \nforth herein. \n196.  Under Titles IV-B and  IV-E of th e Social Security Act,  states receive \ncertain federal monies so long as they enter into plans approved by the United States Department \n  -60-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 64   Filed: 02/13/06   Page 61 of 65 - Page ID # 458\n \nof Health and Human Services and comply with their terms.  Nebraska receives federal funding \nunder Titles IV-B and IV-E of the Social Security Act and has submitted such State Plans, which \nare legal contracts betw een the  federal government and the State,  and such plans have been \napproved.  In these State Plan contracts, the State agrees to provide child welfare, foster care and \nadoption services to Plaintiffs in accordance with  specific statutes, regulations and p olicies and \nall applicable federal regulations and other official issuances of the United States Department of \nHealth and Human Services. \n197.  As a result of their foregoing acti ons and inactions, Defendants have \nbreached and continue to breach their obligations under Nebraska’s State Plan contracts, and all \nPlaintiffs, as the intend ed direct third-party beneficiaries to thes e State Plan contracts, are (i) \nbeing denied their rights under law  to the services and  benefits that the St ate of Nebraska is \nobligated to provide to them under such contracts, and (ii) being harmed thereby. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n198.

The named plaintiffs move for certification\nof a class defined to include:\n     All foster children who are or will be in the legal\n     custody of [the Nebraska Department of Health and Human\n     Services], including those alleged or adjudicated to be\n     abused, neglected or abandoned by their parent,\n     guardian or custodian, and those alleged or adjudicated\n     to be wayward, uncontrollable or habitually truant. \n5\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 10 of 199 - Page ID # 2779\nFiling 11 (Motion to Certify Class).  See also filing 64\n(Amended Complaint), ¶ 35.  The named plaintiffs claim over 6000\nchildren are currently subjected to deficient custodial care\nprovided by the State, the State’s conduct (or lack thereof)\ntoward the named plaintiffs while in foster care is typical of\nthat experienced by all members of the proposed class, and they\nare willing and able to adequately represent the proposed class. \nFiling 11 (Motion to Certify Class). \nThe defendants have moved to dismiss the plaintiffs’\ncomplaint under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of standing and on the\nbasis of Younger and Rooker-Feldman abstention.  The defendants\nalso argue that the claims of named plaintiffs who are no longer\nin HHS legal custody because they have reached the age of\nmajority are moot.  The defendants have also moved to dismiss\nclaims II and III of the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), and\nassert that plaintiffs cannot state a claim for relief under\neither the AACWA or the EPSDT because these federal statutes do\nnot create a private right of action.\nThese parties’ motions raise interrelated arguments.  Many\nof the facts submitted on the class certification motion are\nalso argued in support of or in opposition to the defendants’\nRule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of standing.  The\nindexes of evidence filed by the defendants were offered to both\noppose the motion to certify the class and support the motion to\ndismiss.  See filings 73 (Defendants’ Index of Evidence) and 74\n(Defendants’ Index of Evidence Filed under Seal).  The\nplaintiffs have, in turn, argued that defendants’ evidence\nsupports the class certification motion and undermines the\ndefendants’ motion to dismiss.  They have also filed a\nsupplemental index of evidence in support of their motion for\n6\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 11 of 199 - Page ID # 2780\nclass certification, and have cited this evidence to not only\nrequest class certification, but also oppose the motion to\ndismiss.  See filing 82 (Plaintiffs’ Reply Brief--Class\nCertification), pp. 30-31, 34-36, 39, 44-52; filing 88\n(Plaintiffs’ Brief--Motion to Dismiss), pp. 42-47.  Finally, the\ndefendants’ brief opposing class certification “incorporate[s]\nthe facts, arguments and authorities contained in Defendants’\nMotion to Dismiss and Brief in Support of Defendant’s Motion to\nDismiss. . . ,” (filing 71 (Defendants’ Brief--Class\nCertification), pp. 3-4), and the plaintiffs have briefed the\nissues accordingly.  See filing 82 (Plaintiffs’ Reply Brief--\nClass Certification), p. 36 n. 34. \nThe court’s determination of class certification therefore\nencompasses review of the extensive record submitted for both\nthe motion to certify a class and the motion to dismiss.  To\nfacilitate efficient use of the court’s limited resources, this\nreport and recommendation addresses the issues raised in the\nplaintiffs’ motion for class certification, filing 11, and the\ndefendants’ motion to dismiss, filing 70. \nSUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS \nFor the reasons discussed herein, I shall recommend that:\n-- The plaintiffs’ motion for class certification be\ndenied;\n \n-- The claims of Cheryl H. and Paulette V. be dismissed\nas moot;\n-- The defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of standing\nbecause named plaintiffs, Carson P., Danielle D.,\nJacob P., Bobbi W., and Hannah A. face no real threat\nof imminent harm be denied.  \n7\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 12 of 199 - Page ID # 2781\n-- The defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of standing\nbecause Crystal Foreman, Jodell Bruns, Sara Jensen,\nMicheline Creager, and Vanessa Nkwocha, (the self-\nappointed next friends of Carson P., Danielle D.,\nJacob P., Bobbi W., and Hannah A., respectively), are\nnot capable and appropriate next friends, and\nunauthorized to litigate the legal rights of the named\nplaintiffs, be held in abeyance pending a ruling on\nthe remainder of defendants’ motion to dismiss;\n-- The defendants’ motion to dismiss on the basis of\nRooker-Feldman abstention be denied; \n-- The defendants’ motion to dismiss on the basis of\nYounger abstention be granted;\n-- The defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the\nplaintiffs’ claim based on the federal Adoption\nAssistance and Child Welfare Act (“AACWA”) be granted;\n-- The defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the\nplaintiffs’ claim based on the Early and Periodic\nScreening, Diagnosis and Treatment program of the\nfederal Medicaid Act (“EPSDT”) be denied.\nTHE RECORD\nThe court cannot adequately or appropriately determine the\nissues raised herein without analyzing the voluminous factual\nrecord in the context of Nebraska law.  Therefore, the summary\nof evidence provided hereafter addresses not only the evidence\nfiled of record, but also relevant Nebraska statutes and\njudicial opinions.  “[T]he law of any state of the Union,\nwhether depending upon statutes or upon judicial opinions, is a\nmatter of which the courts of the United States are bound to\ntake judicial notice, without plea or proof.”  McIndoo v.\nBurnett, 494 F.2d 1311, 1313 (8th Cir. 1974)(citing Lamar v.\nMicou, 114 U.S. 218, 223 (1885); Old Hickory Products Co., Ltd.\nv.

The Named Defendants:  The Office of Protection and\nSafety of the Nebraska Health and Human Services\nDepartment. \nThe Protection and Safety department of HHS is tasked with\nproviding “family-centered services to protect children from\nabuse and neglect, to improve conditions in families that place\nchildren at risk, and assisting youth to be productive and law-\nabiding citizens.”  Filing 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative\nCode–HHS), § 1-001 (HHS-003483).  The Protection and Safety\nSystem is, in turn, divided into two areas:  child welfare and\nprotective services (with services provided by “Protective\nServices Workers”), and the Juvenile Services System (the\n“Office of Juvenile Services” with services provided by\n“Juvenile Services Officers.”).  See filing 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska\nAdministrative Code–HHS), §§ 1-001 through 1-004.01\n(HHS-003484–3488).   \n \nA. Entering HHS Legal Custody.  \nAs of December 31, 2005, there were a total of 7636\nchildren in the legal custody of HHS.1  Filing 73, ex. 17\n(Derived Placement Data), p. HHS-011294.  These children entered\nHHS legal custody through one of four ways:\n1) Voluntary placement agreement.2  \n1Of these 7636 children, 135 are runaways and 80 are in\nindependent living.  Filing 73, ex. 17 (Derived Placement Data),\np. HHS-011293. \n2The plaintiffs’ briefs on class certification clarify that\nchildren voluntarily placed in HHS legal custody are not intended\nclass members.\n9\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 14 of 199 - Page ID # 2783\n2) Law enforcement pickup for temporary custody (also\nknown as a “Police Hold”);3\n3) Court adjudications under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-247;4\nand, \n4) Voluntary relinquishment of parental rights.5 \nFiling 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative Code–HHS), § 8-001\n(HHS-003612).  Each method for placement in HHS legal custody\nwill be discussed in turn.  \n1. Voluntary Placement Agreement.  \nA child can be voluntarily and temporarily placed in HHS\ncustody when a parent has no other option for the child’s care,\nand placement is not expected to exceed six months; for example,\nwhen short-term hospitalization is required, the parent must\ncomplete a short-term jail sentence, or short-term respite care\nis needed while in-home services are being arranged.  The parent\nmust agree to participate in specific case plan activities and\nservices and assume financial responsibility for the placement\n3To the extent that children entered HHS temporary legal\ncustody due to alleged abuse and neglect, these children are\ndescribed in the “including” clause of the plaintiffs’ proposed\nclass definition.  The plaintiffs’ briefs on class certification\nclarify that children adjudicated under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-\n247(1), (2), and (4) are not intended class members.\n4Based on the plaintiffs’ briefs on class certification, to\nthe extent that children entered HHS legal custody pursuant to an\nadjudication under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-247(3)(a) and 3(b), these\nchildren are included in the plaintiffs’ intended class.\n5The plaintiffs’ reply brief on class certification argues\nthat a voluntarily relinquished child should be included in the\nputative class even if the child was not also adjudicated under\nNeb. Rev. Stat. § 43-247(3)(a) and/or 3(b).\n10\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 15 of 199 - Page ID # 2784\ncosts, but can terminate the agreement at any time.  If\nplacement lasts for more than six months, the case is referred\nto the county attorney for filing a petition.6  Filing 73, ex. 7\n(Nebraska Administrative Code–HHS), §§ 7.003.01-7.003.01A\n(HHS-003599). \nThere were 22 children in HHS custody pursuant to voluntary\nplacement agreements on December 31, 2005.  Filing 83,\nex. 8 (Defendants’ Answers to Interrogatories), pp. 29-30. \nSee also filing 73, ex. 17 (Derived Placement Data), column\n“03-Vol Placement Agreement,” (HHS-011293).\n2. Police Hold/HHS Temporary Custody.\nA law enforcement officer may place a child in the\ntemporary custody of HHS, without a court order, if the officer\nbelieves the child is seriously endangered by his or her\nsurroundings and needs to be immediately removed, or when the\nofficer believes the juvenile is mentally ill and dangerous. \nFiling 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative Code–HHS), §§ 7-\n003.02, 8-001.01 (HHS-003600, 3612).  See also Neb. Rev. Stat.\n§§ 43-248(3), 43-250(4)&(5)(LEXIS 2005).7  Law enforcement may\n6Voluntary placement is not available for “juvenile\noffenders” or “status offenders.”  See discussion infra.\n7Under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-248, if a law enforcement\nofficer believes a juvenile “is seriously endangered in his or\nher surroundings and immediate removal appears to be necessary\nfor the juvenile's protection,” there are reasonable grounds to\nbelieve he or she is a runaway, or the officer “believes the\njuvenile to be mentally ill and dangerous as defined in section\n71-908 and that the harm described in that section is likely to\noccur before proceedings may be instituted before the juvenile\ncourt,” the juvenile may be taken into temporary custody. \nJuveniles needing protection are delivered to the temporary\ncustody of HHS; juveniles believed to be mentally ill and\n11\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 16 of 199 - Page ID # 2785\ninitiate a “police hold” for the protection of a child based on\ninformation it has directly received, upon notice from HHS\npersonnel that an immediate risk of harm exists, or based upon\nfacts elicited through a law enforcement/HHS joint\ninvestigation.  Filing 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative\nCode–HHS), § 4-002.01 (HHS-003515); ex. 20 (NCPC Model Protocol\nfor the Investigation of Child Abuse and Neglect Cases), p.\nHHS-011412–19).  After the child is in HHS temporary custody,\nthe HHS regulations require caseworkers to secure a placement in\nthe least restrictive setting consistent with the child’s best\ninterest, supervise that placement, consent to any necessary\nemergency medical or mental health treatment, refer the case to\nintake for processing, and contact the county attorney, law\nenforcement, or the court to determine if a court order for\ntemporary custody will be issued.  Filing 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska\nAdministrative Code–HHS), § 8-001.02 (HHS-003612).  \nLaw enforcement placement with HHS can extend for no longer\nthan forty-eight hours.  In the absence of a court order\nauthorizing continued placement, HHS temporary custody\nterminates at forty-eight hours and the child must be returned\nto the custody of his or her parent.  Filing 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska\nAdministrative Code–HHS), § 8-001.02 (HHS-003612-13).\nThere were 24 children in HHS temporary custody pending\nadjudication on December 31, 2005.

Court Intervention. \nThe Nebraska juvenile court has exclusive or original \nconcurrent jurisdiction over juveniles as described in Neb. Rev.\nStat. § 43-247.  Under the Nebraska Juvenile Code, a “juvenile”\nis “any person under 18 years of age,” (Neb. Rev. Stat. §\n43-245(4)(LEXIS 2005)), and therefore no Nebraska juvenile court\ncase may be filed regarding a child who has reached the age of\neighteen.  However, if the child was subject to the juvenile\ncourt’s jurisdiction at the age of eighteen, the court’s\njurisdiction continues until the child turns nineteen or is\nmarried.  Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-245(1)(LEXIS 2005)(\"Age of\nmajority means nineteen years of age\"); Neb. Rev. Stat. §\n43-412(1)(LEXIS 2005)(Office of Juvenile Services commitment\nends on child’s nineteenth birthday);  In re Interest of Steven\nK., 11 Neb. App. 828, 829, 661 N.W.2d 320, 322 (Neb. App.\n2003)(“[M]arriage terminates the minority of a juvenile and,\ntherefore, also ends the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.”).\nThe Nebraska courts may place juveniles in HHS custody when\nthe child needs:  1) state protection and/or care; 2) state\nsupervision; 3) mental health treatment; or 4) state\nrehabilitation.\na.  Juveniles Needing State Protection:  “3(a) Juveniles.”  \nPursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-247(3)(a), the juvenile\ncourt has exclusive original jurisdiction over “abused or\nneglected,” or “dependent” juveniles--commonly referred to as \n“3(a) juveniles.” \n“Dependent juveniles” are children who are homeless or\ndestitute, or without proper support through no fault of their\n13\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 18 of 199 - Page ID # 2787\nparents, guardians, or custodians; for example, where the parent\nis incapacitated or unavoidably absent from home, or where\nparents cannot provide for the exceptional needs of their child. \nNeb. Rev. Stat. § 43-247(3)(a)(LEXIS 2005).  A family has a\ndependent child if no mistreatment has been identified and\ninformation indicates state assistance is required to address the\nchild’s needs.  Filing 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative\nCode–HHS), §§ 3-006.03 & 3-005.02 (HHS-003492, 003511). \n“Abused or neglected” juveniles need state protection from\nthe behavior of their parents, guardians, or custodians. \nJuveniles characterized as “abused or neglected” are:\n-- abandoned children; \n-- those lacking proper parental care by reason of the\nfault or habits of their parents, guardians, or\ncustodians; \n-- those lacking proper or necessary subsistence,\neducation, or other care necessary for their health,\nmorals, or well-being because of neglect or refusal to\nprovide such care, or neglect or refusal to provide\nspecial care required for their mental condition; and\n-- those in a situation or engaging in an occupation\ndangerous to life or limb or injurious to their health\nor morals.   \nNeb. Rev. Stat. § 43-247(3)(a)(LEXIS 2005). \nIn child abuse or neglect cases, HHS regulations require\nthat Protective Services Workers perform an initial assessment by\ngathering information to validate maltreatment or the allegations\nof a court petition, and when necessary, formulate and implement\na plan to secure child safety while working with the family to\npreserve the family unity whenever possible.  § 4-002.01 at HHS-\n003515.  When HHS has determined that a risk of child abuse or\n14\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 19 of 199 - Page ID # 2788\nneglect exists, and voluntary services will not provide for the\nchild’s safety,8 HHS may initiate proceedings for court\nintervention by:  1) requesting temporary custody (e.g.,\nrequesting the court to authorize continuing HHS custody of a\nchild initially placed in HHS temporary custody by law\nenforcement), or 2) requesting that a petition be filed\n(presented to the juvenile court by the county attorney and\noutlining factual circumstances justifying court intervention on\nthe child’s behalf).9  Filing 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative\nCode–HHS), §§ 1-004.01, 8-001.03 through 8-001.05 (HHS-003487,\n003613-14).  If the court enters an order requiring an\nadjudication hearing for an abused or neglected child, HHS\nProtective Service Workers prepare a written case plan and court\nreport outlining HHS’s recommendations for the juvenile court’s\nconsideration, and attend the court hearing to provide testimony\nas requested or oral recommendations as necessary.  Filing 73,\nex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative Code–HHS), §§ 8-001.08, 8-001.10\n(HHS-003487, 003615).  See also Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-1311(1)\n(LEXIS 2005)(HHS shall “[c]onduct or cause to be conducted an\ninvestigation of the child’s circumstances designed to establish\na safe and appropriate plan for the rehabilitation of the foster\nchild and family unit or permanent placement of the child.”).  \n8HHS may arrange for services to be provided on a voluntary\nbasis and then monitor the family’s progress in ameliorating the\nconditions which led to the abuse or neglect.  Filing 73, ex. 20\n(NCPC Model Protocol for the Investigation of Child Abuse and\nNeglect Cases), p. HHS-011420). \n9Law enforcement may decide to arrest the suspected\nperpetrator of child abuse or neglect.  In such cases, the county\nattorney may also initiate criminal proceedings, or may decline\nto prosecute when other measures are deemed more appropriate,\nsuch as pretrial diversion or the filing of a juvenile court\npetition.  Filing 73, Ex. 20 (NCPC Model Protocol for the\nInvestigation of Child Abuse and Neglect Cases) at HHS-011419). \n15\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 20 of 199 - Page ID # 2789\nThe court determines whether the HHS placement\nrecommendations should be adopted.  Filing 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska\nAdministrative Code–HHS), §§ 8-001.08 through 8-001.10 (HHS-\n003487, 003614-15).  The court may permit a 3(a) “abused and\nneglected” juvenile to remain in his or her home subject to\nsupervision, or it may commit the juvenile to (1) institutional\ncare, (2) inpatient or outpatient mental health treatment, (3)\nthe care of a reputable citizen of good moral character, (4) the\ncare of an accredited association dedicated to caring for and\nobtaining homes for juveniles and willing to receive the\njuvenile, (5) the care of a suitable family, or (6) the care and\ncustody of the Department of Health and Human Services.  Neb.\nRev. Stat. § 43-284(LEXIS 2005).  If the juvenile court judge\ndoes not accept the HHS placement recommendation, HHS may file a\nrequest for expedited review by the Juvenile Review Panel.  Neb.\nRev. Stat. § 43-287.04(LEXIS 2005).\nThough the care options described in § 43-284 are also\navailable for 3(a) “dependent” children as ordered by the court,\nsince no maltreatment has been identified in such cases, state\nregulations require HHS to focus first on helping the dependent\nfamilies stay together through the use of parent, family, and\ncommunity resources.  Filing 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative\nCode–HHS), §§ 3-006.03 (HHS-003512).  “Only when family resources\nand community resources are inappropriate or unavailable to meet\nthe family need will Child Protective Services intervention be\nconsidered.”  Filing 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative\nCode–HHS), §§ 3-006.03 (HHS-003512).  \nIn child abuse, neglect, and dependency situations, the\nefforts of HHS Protective Service Workers are directed at working\nwith the children and their families to reduce risk to the child\n16\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 21 of 199 - Page ID # 2790\nin the present and future and help the family become self-\nsufficient.  Filing 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative Code–HHS),\n§§ 1-001, 1-004.01 (HHS-003484, 003487).  For children\nadjudicated under 43-247(3)(a), HHS is required to provide\nongoing services to the child and family, and an updated case\nplan evaluation and report to the presiding juvenile court every\nsix months.

Status offenses are acts that are problematic for\nthe juvenile and family, but not illegal if performed by an\nadult. \nIn status offender situations, the court may place the\njuvenile in HHS legal custody.  Neb. Rev. Stat. 43-286(2)(LEXIS\n2005).  However, parents are expected to exhaust all other\nreasonable community or family resources before asking HHS to\nbecome involved, and they must agree to be actively involved in\nHHS’ plan for services once the child becomes a state ward.  HHS\nprovides services to status offenders only when the court has\ndetermined that a child is a status offender and has ordered the\ndepartment’s involvement.

Neb.\nRev. Stat. § 43-247(1)(LEXIS 2005).  The juvenile court has\nconcurrent original jurisdiction with the district court over\njuveniles who have committed a felony under Nebraska law, (Neb.\nRev. Stat. § 43-247(2)(LEXIS 2005)), and it has concurrent\noriginal jurisdiction with both the district and county courts\nover juveniles who are sixteen or seventeen years of age who have\neither committed a misdemeanor or infraction under Nebraska law,\nhave violated a city or village ordinance, (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-\n247(1)(LEXIS 2005)), or have committed a traffic offense.  Neb.\nRev. Stat. § 43-247(4)(LEXIS 2005).  Such juveniles are also\nknown as “juvenile offenders,” (see filing 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska\nAdministrative Code–HHS), §§ 1-006.08, 8-001.10 (HHS-003494, HHS-\n20\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 25 of 199 - Page ID # 2794\n003614-15)), or  “delinquent juveniles.”  Neb. Rev. Stat. §\n28-709(2)(a)(LEXIS 2005)(“Delinquent child shall mean any child\nunder the age of eighteen years who has violated any law of the\nstate or any city or village ordinance.”).\nThe HHS Office of Juvenile Services (HHS-OJS), and its\nJuvenile Service Officers, provide services for juvenile\noffenders and their families.  Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-401(LEXIS\n2005); filing 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative Code–HHS), § 1-\n004.01(b) (HHS-003487).  Unlike “3a” and “3b” juvenile cases,\nadjudication of juvenile offenders is subject to the provisions\nof the Juvenile Service Act.  Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-401 et seq,\n(LEXIS 2005).    \nA Nebraska court may commit juveniles adjudicated under Neb.\nRev. Stat. § 247 (1),(2) and (4) to the legal custody of HHS-OJS. \nNeb. Rev. Stat. § 43-408(1)(LEXIS 2005).  The court orders the\ninitial “level of treatment” required for juveniles committed to\nthe Office of Juvenile Services; that is, the type of\nsupervision, care, confinement, and rehabilitation services that\nmust be afforded to the juvenile offender.12  Neb. Rev. Stat. §\n43-408(2)(LEXIS 2005); filing 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative\nCode–HHS), §§ 8-001.10 (HHS-003487, 003614-15).  The court may\nrequest a recommendation from the Office of Juvenile Services\nbefore determining the level of treatment needed.  Neb. Rev.\nStat. § 43-408(2)(LEXIS 2005).  The court does not, however,\norder a specific placement for the juvenile.  Neb. Rev. Stat. §\n43-408(2)(LEXIS 2005). \n12Unlike child welfare cases, the initial assessment of\njuvenile offenders is performed by community or Youth Residential\nTreatment Centers.

Neb. Rev. Stat. §\n43-408(3)(LEXIS 2005).  There are three levels of placement\nidentified by HHS for juvenile offenders:  1) home care; 2) out-\nof-home placement with a relative, foster family, agency-based\nfoster care, group home, emergency shelter, residential treatment\ncenter, treatment group home, or in-patient treatment facility;\nand 3) placement in a self-contained, staff-secure residential\nfacility (a Youth Rehabilitation Treatment Center such as those\nlocated in Geneva and Kearney, Nebraska).  Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-\n286(1)(b)(LEXIS 2005); filing 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative\nCode–HHS), §§ 7-004.01B, 8.001.01 (HHS-003602, HHS-003615-16). \nHHS must advise the court of where the juvenile has been placed\nwithin thirty days after placement.  Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-\n408(2)(LEXIS 2005).\nThe court maintains jurisdiction over the juvenile until he\nor she is discharged from the Office of Juvenile Services.  While\nin the custody of the Office of Juvenile Services, HHS must\nprovide reports to the court, and the court must conduct review\nhearings every six months to re-evaluate the juvenile’s placement\nand level of treatment.  Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-408(2)&(3)(LEXIS\n2005).  The juvenile court determines when the juvenile should be\ndischarged from HHS-OJS custody.\n[I]t is clear under the language of § 43-408 that the\ncommitting court maintains jurisdiction over a juvenile\ncommitted to OJS, conducts review hearings every 6\nmonths, and is to receive written notification of the\nplacement and treatment status of juveniles committed\nto OJS at least every 6 months.  See § 43-408(2) and\n(3).  Thus, although the statute speaks of committed\n‘juveniles’ being “discharged from [OJS],” § 43-408(2),\nthe statute does not explicitly say that OJS discharges\nthe juveniles, and, on the contrary, the Legislature\nhas explicitly mandated that the committing court\n22\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 27 of 199 - Page ID # 2796\n“continue[s] to maintain jurisdiction” over a juvenile\ncommitted to OJS.  Id.  Therefore, while OJS may make\nan initial determination with regard to the\nadvisability of the discharge of a juvenile committed\nto OJS, the committing court, as a result of its\nstatutorily imposed continuing jurisdiction, must\napprove the discharge of the juvenile.\nIn re Tamantha S., 267 Neb. 78, 82, 672 N.W.2d 24, 27-28 (Neb.\n2003)(interpreting amendments to Neb.

Juvenile\nServices Officers supervise and monitor the juvenile offender’s\nbehavior, determine if the level of restriction imposed is\nserving to modify the juvenile’s behavior, assist the juvenile in\nmaking arrangements for making restitution or performing\ncommunity service, provide notice to the juvenile of all liberty\n(parole) violations, and attend all hearings.

HHS defines juveniles as “dually adjudicated” if\nthey were adjudicated in more than one of the following\ncategories:  abused and/or neglected (§ 43-247(3)(a)); dependent\n(§ 43-247(3)(a)); status offenders (§ 43-247(3)(b)); or juvenile\noffenders (§ 43-247(1)(2), and/or (4)).  Filing 73, ex. 7\n(Nebraska Administrative Code–HHS), § 3-005.05 (HHS-003511).  The\nchild welfare and protective services and the Office of Juvenile\nServices divisions of HHS may share responsibility for a juvenile\nadjudicated under § 43-247(3) and as a juvenile offender.  As of\nDecember 12, 2005, there were 512 dually adjudicated juveniles. \nSee filing 71 (Defendants’ Brief Opposing Class Certification) at\np. 25. \n     4.

Voluntary relinquishments can be precipitated\nby 3(a) adjudications; that is, where a juvenile court has\ndetermined that a child was abused or neglected, and the child is\nplaced in HHS legal custody, the parent may thereafter decide to\nvoluntarily relinquish parental rights rather than work toward\nreunification.  In such cases, the permanency plan for the child\nbecomes adoption, and the child remains in HHS legal custody\n24\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 29 of 199 - Page ID # 2798\nfollowing the § 43-247(8) adjudication that parental rights have\nbeen relinquished. \nHowever, for children that are not already HHS wards, HHS\ndoes not provide adoption services to parents seeking to\nrelinquish parental rights unless the family has contacted and\nbeen turned down by private social services agencies.

Location. \nMany children in HHS legal custody remain in the physical\ncustody of a parent and are placed in their own homes.  This is\ncommonly referred to as an “in-home placement.”  As of December\n31, 2005, of the 7636 children in the legal custody of HHS, 2361\n(or 23.5%) were placed with their parent or caretaker, and 724 of\nthese children had never been placed outside of their home. \nFiling 73, ex. 17 (Derived Placement Data), p. HHS-011293.  \nIn contrast, a child in HHS legal custody may also be placed\nin another state.  Under the Interstate Compact on the Placement\nof Children (“ICPC”), Neb. Rev.

Native American Placements.\nSpecial placement considerations must be implemented when\nNative American children are adjudicated under Neb. Rev. Stat. §\n43-247(3)(a) and/or (b) and § 43-247(8).  Under the Indian Child\net seq\nWelfare Act of 1978 (“ICWA”), 25 U.S.C. 1901  , and the\nNebraska Indian Child Welfare Act (“NICWA”), Neb. Rev. Stat. §\n \n43-1501 et seq, when the juvenile at issue is an “abused and\nneglected,” “dependent,” “status offender,” or voluntarily\nrelinquished Native American, HHS must use tribal social services\nwhenever possible, with case-planning and services provided based\non the social and cultural standards of the tribe.  HHS must make\n“active efforts,” considered a higher standard than “reasonable\nefforts,” to provide culturally relevant remedial and\nrehabilitative services to prevent the breakup of the family. \nWhere out-of-home placement is required, the child must be placed\nin Native American homes or care facilities authorized or\napproved by tribal authorities unless the biological parents or\nthe child (if over 12 years of age) requests otherwise, or\nadherence to the established placement order is not possible\nbecause placement locations are unavailable or the approved\ncriteria will not address the child’s extraordinary needs.

Oversight by the Nebraska Foster Care Review Board.\nThe Nebraska Foster Care Review Board has been charged with\nproviding ongoing oversight of placement plans and care provided\nby HHS to juveniles in foster care (other than voluntary\nplacements).  Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-1301 et seq,(LEXIS 2005). \nHHS, every court, and every child-placing agency is required to\npromptly notify and provide identifying and explanatory\ninformation to the state board whenever a child is placed in\nfoster care.  Whenever a court has placed a child in foster care,\nthe court must send to the state or designated local board a copy\nof the plan or permanency plan for family reunification or\nadoption of the juvenile, and a copy of any progress reports, the\ncourt order, and the report and recommendation of the guardian ad\nlitem.  Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-1307(LEXIS 2005). \nThe state and local review boards must review each foster\ncare placement at least every six months to determine what\nefforts have been made to carry out the plan or permanency plan\nfor family rehabilitation and reunification or for permanent\nplacement of the child.  The board must assess whether continued\nout-of-home placement is appropriate, whether the child’s current\nplacement is safe, and whether parental rights should be\nterminated, and submit these recommendations and the rationale to\nthe court having jurisdiction over the child.

Filing 74 (Supplemental Evidence Index), ex. 47\n(Nkwocha Deposition), 27, 33-34, 45, 50-51.  She has not\ncontacted the Foster Care Review Board regarding Hannah A., and\nhas not reviewed its recommendations.  Filing 74 (Supplemental\nEvidence Index), ex. 47 (Nkwocha Deposition), 34.\nMs. Nkwocha was contacted by Jennifer Carter of Nebraska\nAppleseed in December 2005 and was asked to be Hannah A.’s next\nfriend.  Filing 74 (Supplemental Evidence Index), ex. 47 (Nkwocha\nDeposition), 34-35.  She agreed to do so because she believes\nHannah A. is worthy of a loving, stable home.  However, she does\nnot know if Hannah A. is currently placed in such a home, and\ndoes not know what efforts are being made by HHS to locate such a\nhome or adoptive parents for Hannah A.

Ms. Nkwocha also believes HHS places too\nmuch emphasis on relative foster home placement and proceeds too\nslowly in terminating parental rights.  She believes HHS should\nhire additional caseworkers, and provide adequate training and\nhigher per diem pay to foster parents.  Filing 74 (Supplemental\nEvidence Index), ex. 47 (Nkwocha Deposition), 64-69.  \nWith regard to the relief requested in this case, Ms.\nNkwocha believes that as to Hannah A., “the damage has been\ndone,” but “the larger picture is that other children would not\nhave to follow in her footsteps with regards to how much time is\nspent in foster care.”  Filing 74 (Supplemental Evidence Index),\nex. 47 (Nkwocha Deposition), 69-70.  She believes that “by\nreforming the system, . . . more children in foster care could\nbenefit from proactive, appropriate placement,” and hopes the\nresults of a federal class action suit will “apply more broadly\nthan just to Hannah. . . .”  Filing 74 (Supplemental Evidence\nIndex), ex. 47 (Nkwocha Deposition), 77.  \nIII. System Reform and Oversight. \nCongress and all three branches of Nebraska’s government\nhave addressed the issue of child welfare reform in Nebraska.\nA. Nebraska Oversight and Reform Efforts.\nAs previously described, the Foster Care Review Board was\ncreated in 1982 to provide continuing oversight of HHS, court,\n57\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 62 of 199 - Page ID # 2831\nand child-agency foster care placements.  The board maintains a\nstatewide registry of all foster care placements, and prepares an\nannual evaluation of such placements.  Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-1303\n(LEXIS 2005). \n \nIn addition to the Foster Care Review Board, pursuant to \nlegislation enacted by Nebraska in 1992, child abuse and neglect\ninvestigation teams were established in each county or contiguous\ngroup of counties in Nebraska.  These teams are required to\ndevelop protocols for investigating child abuse and neglect\ncases; ensuring law enforcement participation in investigations;\nreducing the risk of harm to child abuse and neglect victims;\nensuring that the child is in safe surroundings (including\nremoving the perpetrator when necessary); and sharing case\ninformation as needed for the child’s protection.  Neb. Rev.\nStat. § 28-728.  The requirements for forming the teams to\nestablish protocols were effective as of July 15, 1992.  Neb.\nRev. Stat. § 28-732 (LEXIS 2005).  In response to this\nlegislation, the Protocols Task Force of the Nebraska Commission\nfor the Protection of Children published a “Model Protocol for\nthe Investigation of Child Abuse and Neglect Cases” in July of\n1992.  See filing 73, ex. 20 (NCPC Model Protocol for the\nInvestigation of Child Abuse and Neglect Cases).\nGovernor Ben Nelson issued an executive order in 1993 that \nestablished “The Nebraska Commission for Child Protection.”  The\nCommission was tasked with assessing Nebraska’s progress in\nensuring the safe and healthy development of children and\nadvising the Governor and public of actions needed to protect\nNebraska’s children.

See filing 73, ex. 10 (2005\nCitizen Review Assessment--Governor’s Commission for the\nProtection of Children)(reviewing the efficacy of the Child\nProtective Service’s intake processes).\nB. Federal Oversight Through Funding Requirements. \nCongress has enacted statutes that permit the United States\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (USHHS) to oversee state\nchild welfare services in exchange for federal funding.  Title\nIV-B of the Social Security Act offers federal funds to “State\npublic welfare agencies [to] establish[ ], extend[ ], and\nstrengthen[ ] child welfare services.”  42 U.S.C. § 620(a).  To\nbe eligible for these federal funds, Nebraska must submit a plan\nin accordance with 42 U.S.C. § 622 for approval by USHHS, and be\nin substantial compliance with the terms of that plan. \nImplementing regulations require the state to submit a Child and\nFamily Services Plan (CFSP) to the Administration for Children\nand Families (ACF), (see 45 C.F.R. § 284.11).  “The CFSP will be\napproved only if the plan was developed jointly by ACF and the\nState (or the Indian Tribe), and only after broad consultation by\nthe State (and the Indian Tribe) with a wide range of appropriate\npublic and non-profit private agencies and community-based\norganizations with experience in administering programs of\nservices for children and families (including family preservation\nand support services).”  45 C.F.R. § 1357.15 (b)(4).\n59\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 64 of 199 - Page ID # 2833\nACF, acting through Child and Family Services (CFS),\nperforms reviews to determine if the state is complying with the\nfederally approved CFSP.  45 C.F.R. § 1355.32-1355.33.

If the state\ndoes not comply with the PIP, penalties may be assessed.  45\nC.F.R. § 1355.38.\n \nCFS performed initial on-site reviews in 2002 to determine\nif the states were complying with their approved CFSPs.  After\nits initial review, ACF found that all fifty states plus the\nDistrict of Columbia were not in substantial compliance with the\nfederal guidelines.  Filing 73, ex. 36 (Reckling Affidavit) ¶¶ 8-\n9; ex. 18 (May 2002 Child and Family Services Review Statewide\nAssessment). \nAreas identified by the review as requiring improvement in\nNebraska included:\n-- improving the response time on reports of child\nmaltreatment;\n-- ensuring a stable living environment by providing\nreunification within twelve months or adoption within\n24 months of the child’s entry into foster care;\n-- curtailing the practice of establishing guardianship\nfor young children rather than exploring adoption as a\npermanency goal;\n-- increasing the frequency and quality of face-to-face\ncontacts between caseworkers and the children and\nparents;\n-- providing consistent efforts to meet the child’s\nphysical and mental health needs;\n60\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 65 of 199 - Page ID # 2834\n-- improving case review, quality assurance, the service\narray, and foster and adoptive parent licensing,\nrecruitment, and retention.\nFiling 73, ex. 16 (Prog.

Current Status and Continuing Reform Efforts.\nIn its 2004 annual report, the Foster Care Review Board\nnoted that “Nebraska has one of the highest national per capita\nratios of children in foster care, primarily due to a lack of\nprevention programs capable of identifying and addressing many\nfamily issues before they became so critical that removal is\nnecessary.”  Filing 73, ex. 14 (Foster Care Rev. Bd. 2004 Annual\nReport), p. HHS-010991.  The board made substantial\nrecommendations for restructuring the state’s child welfare\ndelivery system, creating expedited review processes to afford\nquicker permanent placements, using state and federal funds more\neffectively, and holding perpetrators of abuse accountable. \nFiling 73, ex. 14 (Foster Care Rev. Bd. 2004 Annual Report), p.\nHHS-010980-91.  \nHowever, the 2004 annual state board report also noted that\nchildren’s outcomes within the HHS had recently improved due to\nthe efforts of defendants Reckling and Montanez, and the\nimplementation of those efforts by HHS caseworkers, supervisors,\nmanagers, and the child welfare system.

Court and child\nwelfare agency leaders from every state, the District of\nColumbia, and three U.S. territories attended this summit, the\nfocus of which was to prompt nationwide reform in the way child\nabuse and neglect cases are moved through court systems and to\nreduce delays in securing safe, permanent homes for children in\nfoster care.  Each state was tasked with developing an individual\naction plan to improve child protection procedures, with these\nstate plans to be nationally compiled into a National Call to\nAction for state courts.

Motion for Class Certification.\nThe named plaintiffs move for certification of a class\ndefined to include:\n     All foster children who are or will be in the legal\n     custody of [the Nebraska Department of Health and Human\n     Services], including those alleged or adjudicated to be\n     abused, neglected or abandoned by their parent,\n     guardian or custodian, and those alleged or adjudicated\n     to be wayward, uncontrollable or habitually truant. \nFiling 11.  They claim systemic deficiencies exist in Nebraska’s\nfoster care system, and class certification will save the\nresources of both the courts and the parties by facilitating a\nglobal resolution of issues potentially affecting every putative\nclass member.  See General Tel. Co. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 155\n(1982).\nA plaintiff moving for class certification has the burden of\nshowing that the class should be certified and that the\nrequirements of Rule 23 are met.  Coleman v. Watt, 40 F.3d 255,\n258-59 (8th Cir. 1994).  Under Rule 23(a), one or more members of\na class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of\nall class members if:\n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all\nmembers is impracticable;\n \n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the\nclass;\n(3) the claims or defenses of the representative\nparties are typical of the claims or defenses of the\nclass; and, \n64\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 69 of 199 - Page ID # 2838\n(4) the representative parties will fairly and\nadequately protect the interests of the class.\nId.  See also General Telephone Co. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 330\n(1980)(noting that the Rule 23(a) requirements are commonly\nreferred to as “numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy\nof representation.”).\nThe putative class must also satisfy one of the provisions\nof Rule 23(b).  Elizabeth M. v. Montenez, 2006 WL 2346469 at *4\n(8th Cir. August 15, 2006); Caroline C. v. Johnson, 174 F.R.D.\n452, 466 (D.Neb. 1996).  The named plaintiffs seek to certify a\nclass under Rule 23(b)(2).  Filing 11, p. 2.  Therefore, they\nmust show that “the party opposing the class has acted or refused\nto act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby\nmaking appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding\ndeclaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.”  Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).\nThe plaintiffs seeks broad declaratory and injunctive relief\nagainst a state agency.  “A federal court may not lightly assume\nthis power. ‘Where, as here, the exercise of authority by state\nofficials is attacked, federal courts must be constantly mindful\nof the special delicacy of the adjustment to be preserved between\nfederal equitable power and State administration of its own\nlaw.’”  Elizabeth M., 2006 WL 2346469, at *2 (8th Cir. August\n15, 2006)(quoting Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 378 (1976)).  \n“Federal courts operate according to institutional rules and\nprocedures that are poorly suited to the management of state\nagencies.”  Angela R. v. Clinton, 999 F.2d 320, 326 (8th Cir.\n1993).  “[T]his concern is heightened in the class action context\nbecause of the likelihood that an order granting class\ncertification ‘may force a defendant to settle rather than incur\n65\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 70 of 199 - Page ID # 2839\nthe costs of defending a class action and run the risk of\npotentially ruinous liability.’”  Elizabeth M., 2006 WL 2346469,\nat *2 (8th Cir. August 15, 2006)(quoting Advisory Committee Notes\nto 1998 Amendments adopting Rule 23(f)).  \n“Consequently, before certifying a class seeking broad\ninjunctive relief against a state agency, a district court must\nensure that it has Article III jurisdiction to entertain each\nclaim asserted by the named plaintiffs,” . . . “[a]nd the court\nmust conduct a ‘rigorous analysis’ to ensure that the\nprerequisites of Rule 23 are satisfied.”  Elizabeth M., 2006 WL\n2346469, at *2 (8th Cir. August 15, 2006)(citing Falcon, 457 U.S.\nat 161).   A “plaintiffs’ failure to identify the specific\npolicies under attack and the nature of their federal statutory\nclaims” in a massive class action “neither promotes the\nefficiency and economy underlying class actions nor pays\nsufficient heed to the [principles of] federalism and separation\nof powers.”  Elizabeth M., 2006 WL 2346469, at *6 (8th Cir.\nAugust 15, 2006)(citing Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 349 (1996);\nRizzo, 423 U.S. at 378).\nThe court may not consider the factual merits or weaknesses\nof plaintiffs’ underlying claims when determining if a class\nshould be certified.  Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156\n(1974).  However, a class determination  “generally involves\nconsiderations that are ‘enmeshed in the factual and legal issues\ncomprising the plaintiff's cause of action.’”  Falcon, 457 U.S.\nat 160 (citing Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463\n(1978)). \n  \nSometimes the issues are plain enough from the\npleadings to determine whether the interests of the\nabsent parties are fairly encompassed within the named\n66\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 71 of 199 - Page ID # 2840\nplaintiff's claim, and sometimes it may be necessary\nfor the court to probe behind the pleadings before\ncoming to rest on the certification question. \nFalcon, 457 U.S. at 160.  Although the court does not at this\nstage examine and determine the merits of the plaintiffs’ case,\nit may properly conduct a preliminary inquiry of the evidence\nrelating to plaintiffs’ allegations of systemic deficiencies in\nthe foster care system and the alleged resulting harm suffered by\nthe class, as well as the manner in which that evidence fits into\nthe legal framework governing the claims pleaded.  Blades v.\nMonsanto Co., 400 F.3d 562, 566 (8th Cir. 2005).  See also\nElizabeth M., 2006 WL 2346469, at *5 (8th Cir. August 15,\n2006)(“Though class certification is not the time to address the\nmerits of the parties’ claims and defenses, the ‘rigorous\nanalysis’ under Rule 23 must involve consideration of what the\nparties must prove.”).\nThe parties do not dispute that the numerosity requirement\nof class certification has been met.  The defendants also\n“concede that Plaintiffs have provided this Court with\nallegations sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Rule\n23(b)(2).”  Filing 71 (Defendants’ Brief–Class Certification), p.\n35.  Finally, there is no claim that counsel for the named\nplaintiffs are not qualified and competent to represent the\nclass, and I specifically find that they are.\nRather, the defendants oppose class certification for the\nfollowing reasons:\n• The plaintiffs’ proposed class definition is vague and\nambiguous.\n• The proposed class, as defined, lacks commonality: \nThere is no common question of fact because the class\n67\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 72 of 199 - Page ID # 2841\ndefinition includes children who came into the foster\ncare system in different ways, with differing needs,\nand whose circumstances must be evaluated on a case-by-\ncase basis; and there is no common question of law when\nthe outcome of legal issues depends on individualized\nfactual determinations.   \n• The claims of the named plaintiffs are not typical of\nthe class as a whole, because the named plaintiffs have\nfew, if any, complaints at this time and any harm\nallegedly occurring within the system is special and\nunique to each child.\n• The named plaintiffs, acting by and through their next\nfriends, cannot adequately represent the class.  The\nproposed class is diverse, but the named plaintiffs are\nall “3(a) juveniles,” and Cheryl H. and Paulette V. are\nnow adults and therefore no longer have claims.  As to\nthe next friends, the defendants claim they have little\nincentive to direct this litigation, and are using the\nnamed plaintiffs to pursue their personal agendas\nrather than truly represent the named plaintiffs’\ninterests.\nA. The Class Definition.\nThe plaintiffs’ proposed class is:\nAll foster children who are or will be in the legal\n     custody of [the Nebraska Department of Health and Human\n     Services], including those alleged or adjudicated to be\n     abused, neglected or abandoned by their parent,\n     guardian or custodian, and those alleged or adjudicated\n     to be wayward, uncontrollable or habitually truant. \nFiling 64 (Amended Complaint), ¶ 35.  This class definition has\nspawned considerable briefing by both parties.  The defendants\nclaim plaintiffs’ proposed class definition is ambiguous, and\ncreates a “fail-safe” class and a standing issue.  Filing 71\n(Defendants’ Brief--Class Certification), pp. 11-33.  The\nplaintiffs claim the class members are capable of ascertainment,\nand even if the class definition is not perfect, the plaintiffs’\n68\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 73 of 199 - Page ID # 2842\nbrief explains the intended scope of the class and the court is\nempowered to redraft the class definition accordingly.  Filing 13\n(Plaintiffs’ Brief--Class Certification), pp. 7-9; filing 82\n(Plaintiffs’ Reply Brief--Class Certification), pp. 9-13, 16.\nHaving thoroughly reviewed the parties’ arguments, the\nplaintiffs’ amended complaint, and the evidence, and having\ninterpreted these submissions in the context of Nebraska’s\njuvenile code, statutes and court system, I conclude the\nplaintiffs’ proposed class definition is both ambiguous and\ninconsistent with their stated intent as set forth in their class\ncertification briefs, filings 13 and 82.  I also conclude that in\nthe interest of permitting the court to further consider the\nplaintiffs’ motion for class certification and the defendants’\nmotions to dismiss, and to avoid further delaying these\nproceedings, the court should exercise its discretion and attempt\nto redefine the class in a manner consistent with the plaintiffs’\nstated intent.18 \n1. Proposed Class Definition--Ambiguous and Inconsistent\nwith the Plaintiffs’ Stated Intent.\nThe defendants claim that the definition is ambiguous\nbecause: 1) the term “foster children” is not defined and it is\nunclear whether “in-home” placements of juveniles in HHS legal\ncustody are considered “foster children” for the purposes of this\nlitigation, and 2) it is unclear whether adding the phrase\n“including those alleged or adjudicated to be abused, neglected\nor abandoned by their parent, guardian or custodian, and those\nalleged or adjudicated to be wayward, uncontrollable or\n18The court’s attempt to redefine the class in this section\nof the report and recommendation should not be interpreted as a\nrecommendation that a class be certified.\n69\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 74 of 199 - Page ID # 2843\nhabitually truant” to the class definition serves to narrow the\nscope of the class, or whether the class nonetheless includes all\njuveniles in “foster care” who are or will be in HHS “legal\ncustody.” \nThe plaintiffs forcefully claim the scope of the class is\nclear from their proposed definition recited above, especially\nwhen interpreted in the context of their initial class\ncertification brief.  The plaintiffs refer to the defendants’\nambiguity claims and their thorough explanation of Nebraska’s\njuvenile code and court system as a “tortured and unnecessary\nexegesis” supported by “red herring arguments.”  Filing 82\n(Plaintiffs’ Reply Brief--Class Certification), p. 10.  For the\nreasons discussed below, I disagree.  \na. Ambiguity of the Term, “Foster Children.” \nThe plaintiffs’ claim that “children in HHS legal custody\nbut currently residing in their own homes (either because they\nwere never removed or are on “trial reunification”) are within\nthe class definition. . . .”  Filing 82 (Plaintiffs’ Reply\nBrief--Class Certification) at 13.  The defendants claim the use\nof “foster children” in the class definition creates ambiguity\nbecause “‘foster children’” may be interpreted as either\n“including those juveniles residing with their parent or guardian\nor excluding those juveniles residing with their parent or\nguardian.”  Filing 71 (Defendants’ Brief–Class Certification) at\n30.  Defendants are correct.\nClarifying the definition of “foster children” is very\nimportant in the context of this case because a substantial\nnumber of proposed class members will either be included or\nexcluded from the class depending on how the term is defined.  Of\n70\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 75 of 199 - Page ID # 2844\nthe 6124 juveniles who were Child Protective Services wards on\nDecember 31, 2005, 1795 were in “in-home” placements (23.51%);\nthat is, children who are in HHS legal custody but “placed” in\ntheir own home.  Of these 1795 in-home placements, 546 had never\nbeen “placed” out of their homes.  Filing 73, ex. 17 (Derived\nPlacement Data), column “01-HHS Ward,” (HHS-011293).\nThe plaintiffs argue that “foster care custody as that term\nis commonly used,” (Filing 82 (Plaintiffs’ Reply\nBrief--Class Certification) at 11), includes those children in\nHHS legal custody with “in-home” placements.  Id. at 10.  This\ndefinition of “foster children” contradicts the common usage of\nthat phrase, the definition used in federal regulations governing\nfederal funding requirements for child welfare programs, and the\nimplicit meaning of the term under Nebraska’s Foster Care Review\nAct, Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-1301 et seq.19  \nA “foster child” is “a child raised by someone who is not\nits natural or adoptive parent.”  Random House Webster’s\nUnabridged Dictionary 756 (2d ed. 1997).  A “foster child” is\n“[a] child whose care and upbringing are entrusted to an adult\nother than the child’s natural or adoptive parents.”  Black’s Law\n19The plaintiffs’ argument that “foster children” includes\nthose in “in-home” placement also appears to contradict the\nplaintiffs’ use of that term in the Amended Complaint.  For\nexample, the plaintiffs allege:  “Reasonable professional\njudgment and applicable law dictate that the placement of a child\nin foster care must be temporary.  Foster children and their\nfamilies must be provided with planning and services necessary\nfor the children to be promptly returned to the custody of their\nparents or other caretakers, when it is safe to do so.  When it\nis not safe or appropriate for children to be ‘reunified’ with\ntheir own families, foster children must receive prompt efforts\nto find them an alternative permanent home, typically through\nadoption.”  Filing 64 (Amended Complaint), ¶ 155.\n71\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 76 of 199 - Page ID # 2845\nDictionary 232 (7th ed. 1999).  The federal regulations for “The\nAdministration on Children, Youth and Families, Foster Care\nMaintenance Payments, Adoption Assistance, and Child and Family\nServices” define foster care as:\n24-hour substitute care for children placed away from\ntheir parents or guardians and for whom the State\nagency has placement and care responsibility.  This\nincludes, but is not limited to, placements in foster\nfamily homes, foster homes of relatives, group homes,\nemergency shelters, residential facilities, child care\ninstitutions, and preadoptive homes.\n45 C.F.R. § 1355.20(a).  \nNebraska’s Foster Care Review Act defines “[f]oster care\nplacements [as] all placements of juveniles as described in\nsubdivision (3)(b) of section 43-247, placements of neglected,\ndependent, or delinquent children, including those made directly\nby parents or by third parties, and placements of children who\nhave been voluntarily relinquished pursuant to section 43-106.01\nto the Department of Health and Human Services or any child\nplacement agency licensed by the Department of Health and Human\nServices.”  Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-1301(4)(LEXIS 2005)(emphasis\nadded).  While the phrase “all placements” of children in HHS\nlegal custody would appear to include “in-home” placements as\n“foster care placements,” the remainder of the Foster Care Review\nAct places this statutory interpretation in doubt.  \nUnder § 43-1308, the Foster Care Review Board must “[s]ubmit\nto the court having jurisdiction over such child for the purposes\nof foster care placement . . . its findings and recommendations\nregarding the efforts and progress made to carry out the plan or\npermanency plan . . . regarding the child,” including “whether\nthere is a need for continued out-of-home placement. . . . ” \n72\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 77 of 199 - Page ID # 2846\nNeb. Rev. Stat. § 43-1308 (1)(b)(LEXIS 2005).  “If the return of\nthe child to his or her parents is not likely,” the board must\nrecommend referral for adoption and termination of parental\nrights, guardianship, placement with a relative, or, as a last\nresort, another planned, permanent living arrangement. . . .” \nNeb. Rev. Stat. § 43-1308(1)(c)(LEXIS 2005).  HHS likewise must\npursue termination of parental rights or a permanency plan if a\n“child has been placed in foster care,” and “the return of the\nchild to his or her parents is not likely.”  Neb. Rev. Stat. §\n43-1312 (1)(a) & (2)(LEXIS 2005).  “In reviewing the foster care\nstatus and permanency plan of a child . . ., the court shall\ncontinue placement outside the home upon a written determination\nthat return of the child to his or her home would be contrary to\nthe welfare of such child and that reasonable efforts to preserve\nand reunify the family . . . have been made.”  Neb. Rev. Stat. §\n43-1315(LEXIS 2005).  \nAlthough a strict interpretation of “foster care placement”\nas that term is defined under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-1301(4) could\ninclude placement of juveniles in HHS legal custody (other than\nvoluntary placements) in the juvenile’s own home, I conclude\nNebraska’s Foster Care Review Act contemplates defining a foster\nchild as one who has been placed outside the home.  See e.g.\nMatter of Lucinda G., 122 Misc.2d 416, 420, 471 N.Y.S.2d 736, 739\n(N.Y. Fam. Ct. 1983)(“The definition of ‘foster care’ in [New\nYork statutory law] does not contemplate care provided a child in\nthe home of a natural parent.  Although the term ‘foster parent’\nas defined . . . is deemed to include ‘any person’ with whom a\nchild is placed for care, both the term ‘foster parent’ and the\nterm ‘foster child’ contemplate placement of a person who is \n‘. . . in the care, custody or guardianship of an authorized\nagency.’”).  \n73\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 78 of 199 - Page ID # 2847\nMore importantly, for the purposes of this litigation, the\nquestion is whether the term “foster children” must be clarified\nfor the class to be “capable of ascertainment under some\nobjective standard.”  Caroline C., 174 F.R.D. at 459.  “[T]he\nboundaries of the class must not be amorphous.”  Id.  Despite the\nplaintiffs’ claim to the contrary, I conclude that under a common\nsense interpretation of the proposed class definition, absent a\nmodification or clarification of the definition by the court, the\nclass of “[a]ll foster children who are or will be in the legal\ncustody of [the Nebraska Department of Health and Human\nServices]” would not include children adjudicated under § 43-247\nand in HHS legal custody, but “placed” in their own homes.  Since\nthe plaintiffs’ intent was to include “in-home” placements as\nmembers of the class, the class definition should be modified.\nb. Ambiguity of the “Including” Clause of the Proposed\nClass Definition.\nThe plaintiffs describe the class as all foster children in\nHHS legal custody, “including those alleged or adjudicated to be\nabused, neglected or abandoned by their parent, guardian or\ncustodian, and those alleged or adjudicated to be wayward,\nuncontrollable or habitually truant.”  The defendants claim it is\nunclear whether the “including” clause of the definition limits\nthe class to “alleged or adjudicated” § 43-247(3)(a) abuse and\nneglect victims and “3(b) juveniles,” or if the clause merely\nexplains a sampling of the class of juveniles considered “foster\nchildren who are or will be in the legal custody” of HHS.  \nThe plaintiffs argue that the class definition is clear when\nconsidered in the context of the plaintiffs’ complaint and the\narguments in their brief.  They claim that as “set forth in their\nMemorandum in Support, Plaintiffs’ class definition can be\n74\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 79 of 199 - Page ID # 2848\nunderstood, and the class clearly defined, simply by reference to\nthe language of Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-247(3)(a) & (b).”  Filing 82\n(Plaintiffs’ Reply Brief--Class Certification) at 10.  They\nappear to be arguing that the clause “including those alleged or\nadjudicated to be abused, neglected or abandoned by their parent,\nguardian or custodian, and those alleged or adjudicated to be\nwayward, uncontrollable or habitually truant,” actually limits\nthe scope of the class.  The plaintiffs state that their\nMemorandum in Support and Amended Complaint “make clear that the\njuvenile delinquent population--those children placed in the\ncustody of HHS’ Office of Juvenile Services (HHS/OJS) - is\nexcluded,” (id.), [t]hose few children in custody for being\n“mentally ill and dangerous” pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-\n247(3)(c) are also clearly not included,” (id. at 12), and “so-\ncalled ‘voluntary’ placements . . . are not part of the class.” \nId. at 9. \nContrary to the plaintiffs’ argument, there is considerable\nreason to challenge the proposed class definition in its current\nstate.  Although the plaintiffs’ initial class certification\nbrief may be interpreted as stating juvenile offenders, voluntary\nplacements, and “mentally ill and dangerous” juveniles are not\nincluded in the class, it is unclear from the proposed definition\nalone whether the plaintiffs intended the class to include “all\nfoster children in HHS legal custody,” or only those “alleged or\nadjudicated to be abused, neglected or abandoned by their parent,\nguardian or custodian, and those alleged or adjudicated to be\nwayward, uncontrollable or habitually truant.”  \nThe class should be clearly defined at the outset of\nlitigation.  Doe v. Lally, 467 F. Supp. 1339, 1343 (D.C.Md.\n1979).  While briefs can be used to clarify the intended scope of\n75\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 80 of 199 - Page ID # 2849\na class definition (and are absolutely necessary when the court\nis called upon to redraft the class definition), the definition\nshould be sufficiently precise, standing alone, to afford the\ncourt and parties the ability to ascertain who is a class member. \nParsing through and deciphering the parties’ adversarial briefs\nis not a reasonable substitute for a clearly stated class\ndefinition.  Class definitions inform the court, all named\nparties, and the class members concerning the scope of putative\nmembers entitled to notice of the proceedings, who can ultimately\nenforce a favorable ruling, and who will be bound by an adverse\none.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B); Garrish v. United Auto.,\nAerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, 149 F.\nSupp. 2d 326, 330-31 (E.D. Mich. 2001); Zapata v. IBP, Inc., 167\nF.R.D. 147, 156 (D. Kan. 1996); Vernon J. Rockler and Co., Inc.\nv. Graphic Enterprises, Inc., 52 F.R.D. 335, 338 n. 2 (D. Minn.\n1971).  \nThe most straightforward statement explaining the\nplaintiffs’ intended class is set forth in their reply brief on\nclass certification.  Plaintiffs state:\nThe class definition proposed by Plaintiffs is limited\nand, in effect, requires that only two simple questions\nregarding class members be answered: (1) Is the child\n[] in the legal custody of HHS? (2) Is the child\nalleged or adjudicated pursuant to either Neb. Rev.\nStat. §§ 43-247(3)(a) or (3)(b)?  Any child not in the\nlegal custody of HHS and not alleged or adjudicated to\nbe abused, neglected, deprived, a status offender or in\none of the other enumerated categories of children set\nforth in Sections (3)(a) or (3)(b) - for example a\nchild exclusively alleged or adjudicated delinquent\npursuant [to] Sections 1,2,or 4 - would not be included\nin the class.  \nFiling 82 (Plaintiffs’ Reply Brief--Class Certification) at 10.  \n76\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 81 of 199 - Page ID # 2850\nThe plaintiffs’ proposed class definition cannot be\ninterpreted consistent with this stated intent.  If the\nplaintiffs’ class definition is interpreted to include all\nchildren who are or will be in HHS legal custody, and the\n“including” clause provides only an example of such juveniles,\nthe class definition is broader than plaintiffs’ intent.  Such an\ninterpretation would include, for example, juvenile offenders.  \nIf the class is limited by the “including” clause to “those\nalleged or adjudicated to be abused, neglected or abandoned by\ntheir parent, guardian or custodian, and those alleged or\nadjudicated to be wayward, uncontrollable or habitually truant,”\nthe definition is narrower than plaintiffs’ intended class.  The\n“including” clause of the proposed class definition does not\ndescribe all 3(a) juveniles, and in particular, it does not\nidentify 3(a) “dependent” juveniles--those who are homeless or\ndestitute, or without proper support through no fault of their\nparents, guardians, or custodians--as members of the class.20  \n20It is important to note that plaintiffs’ amended complaint\nstates “over 6,000 abused, neglected or otherwise deprived\nchildren” are in HHS legal custody,” (filing 64 (Amended\ncomplaint) ¶ 3), which would necessarily have to include all 3(a)\nand 3(b) juveniles.  However, the allegations actually describing\nthe defendants’ alleged wrongful conduct identify the victims of\nthat conduct as “abused and neglected” children.  Children\n“without proper support,” and “homeless” or “destitute” children\nare never specifically mentioned in the amended complaint, and\nother than in the class definition set forth in paragraph 35,\n“wayward,” “uncontrollable,” or “habitually truant” children are\nnever identified as victims of defendants’ systemic failures. \nabused\nSee Amended Complaint ¶ 4, “HHS inflicts numerous harms on \nand neglected \nchildren while they are in state custody;” ¶ 107,\n“The described experiences of the Named Plaintiffs are not\natypical, but instead are all too common illustrations of\nDefendants’ pattern and practice of deliberate indifference\ntowards, and widespread and systemic failure to exercise and\nimplement reasonable professional judgment regarding, the health,\nabused and neglected \nsafety and welfare of the  foster children\nthey are legally obligated to care for and protect;” ¶ 109,\n77\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 82 of 199 - Page ID # 2851\nI therefore conclude the class must first be redefined if\nthe court is to embark on determining if class certification is\nappropriate. \n2. Crafting a Class Definition.\nThe plaintiffs argue that their intended class definition\nwas limited to:  1) children in the legal custody of HHS, 2) who\nwere alleged or adjudicated pursuant to either Neb. Rev. Stat. §§\n43-247(3)(a) or (3)(b).  Filing 82 (Plaintiffs’ Reply\nBrief--Class Certification) at 10.  Using the foregoing\nstatement, and incorporating a clear definition of the “foster\nchildren” to be included in the class, the class could be defined\nas follows:\n     All children who: \n    1)  have not reached the age of majority as defined under\n     Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-245(1); \n     2)  are or will be in the legal custody of Nebraska’s\n     Department of Health and Human Services; and \n     3)  are alleged or adjudicated to be the children described\n     in Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-247(3)(a) and/or § 43-247(3)(b).\nabuse and\n“Plaintiff children who have been traumatized by \nneglect \nand removal from their homes are subject to further harm\nwhile in the State’s foster care system;” ¶ 129, “Far too often\nPlaintiff children brought into Nebraska’s foster care custody\nabuse or neglect \nbecause of  at the hands of their own biological\nparents or other caregivers are subject to further abuse, neglect\nand other maltreatment and harmful conditions while in the\ncustody of the State.” ¶ 149, “Health services are particularly\n abused and neglected \nimportant to foster children, as children\nwho enter foster care frequently have more serious health care\nneeds. . . .”  Filing 64 (Amended Complaint)(emphasis added).\n78\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 83 of 199 - Page ID # 2852\nThis definition is simple and straightforward, but it may not\nincorporate all the children plaintiffs seek to represent. \nAs set forth in plaintiffs’ class certification reply brief,\n“[a]ny child not in the legal custody of HHS and not alleged or\nadjudicated to be abused, neglected, deprived, a status offender\nor in one of the other enumerated categories of children set\nforth in Sections (3)(a) or (3)(b)” is not included in the class. \nFiling 82 (Plaintiffs’ Reply Brief--Class Certification) at 10.\nHowever, the same reply brief argues that children who are\nvoluntarily relinquished to the State, (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-\n247(8)(LEXIS 2005)), should be included in the class even if they\nwere never  alleged or adjudicated to be 3(a) and/or 3(b)\njuveniles.  Filing 82 (Plaintiffs’ Reply Brief--Class\nCertification), p. 12.  These statements cannot be reconciled.  \nSince the plaintiffs have advanced two conflicting\narguments, have noted the court is empowered to construct a class\ndefinition that would include voluntarily relinquished children,\n(filing 82 (Plaintiffs’ Reply Brief--Class Certification), p. 12\nn. 10), and the court has decided to redefine the class in this\ncase, the question now presented is whether juveniles in HHS\ncustody on the basis of voluntary relinquishment should be\nincluded as members of the putative class.  I agree with\nplaintiffs that juveniles adjudicated under 3(a) and/or 3(b) and\nvoluntarily relinquished under § 43-247(8) should be included in\nthe class.  However, juveniles in HHS legal custody solely under\n§ 43-247(8) should not be included in the class.\nThe allegations of the plaintiffs’ complaint contain no\ndescription and make no mention of the type of juveniles\nadjudicated solely under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-247(8), yet the\n79\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 84 of 199 - Page ID # 2853\nplaintiffs’ class certification reply brief argues such juveniles\nshould be class members because “there is no reason for them to\nbe treated differently than” 3(a) and 3(b) juveniles.  Filing 82\n(Plaintiffs’ Reply Brief--Class Certification), p. 12.  The\nfactual record contradicts this sweeping statement.  Moreover,\nwhen tasked with crafting a class definition, the court, like the\nplaintiffs, must consider Rule 23(a)’s “numerosity, commonality,\ntypicality, and adequacy of representation” requirements. \nGeneral Telephone Co., 446 U.S. at 330.  See e.g. Barney v.\nHolzer Clinic, Ltd., 110 F.3d 1207, 1214 (6th Cir. 1997)(holding\nthe trial court committed plain error by failing to amend the\nclass definition and narrow the scope of the class where the\nnamed plaintiffs’ claims were not typical of those of the\nenormous class certified and they could not adequately represent\nsuch a class).\nJuveniles who were neither 3(a) or 3(b) juveniles, but are\nvoluntarily relinquished and accepted into HHS legal custody\npresent a unique situation.21  HHS will not accept a\nrelinquishment of parental rights for a teenager unless the child\nand family have been receiving HHS services and there is a plan\nfor adoption.  Moreover, if the child is not already an HHS\nprotective services ward (a 3(a) or 3(b) juvenile), HHS does not\nprovide adoption services to parents seeking to relinquish their\nrights unless adoption services are unavailable through private\nagencies.  An example of such a situation is where the “[c]hild\nis so severely disabled that an adoptive placement would require\na medical subsidy, and the family has been denied services by\n21Such juveniles are so unique that as of December 31, 2005,\nthere were no children in HHS legal custody solely on the basis\nof a voluntary relinquishment of parental rights.   Filing 73,\nex. 17 (Derived Placement Data), column “05-Direct\nRelinquishment,” (HHS-011293).\n80\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 85 of 199 - Page ID # 2854\nprivate agencies.”  Filing 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative\nCode–HHS), §§ 3-005.06, 3-006.07 (HHS-003511, 003513).  See also\n“Subsidized Adoption” eligibility and procedures at filing 73,\nex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative Code–HHS), § 6-003 et seq\n(HHS-003560-3576).  \nThough the complaint alleges HHS fails to make sufficient\nefforts to locate appropriate foster care placements and adoptive\nparents for children in its custody, the plaintiffs have not\nalleged and have presented no evidence that HHS case management\nand permanency planning for juveniles adjudicated solely under §\n43-247(8) is, or should be, substantially similar to the efforts\nprovided by HHS on behalf of 3(a) or 3(b) juveniles.  None of the\nnamed plaintiffs was adjudicated solely under § 43-247(8).  There\nis no showing that the placement difficulties allegedly\nexperienced by the named plaintiffs, all of whom are 3(a) and/or\n3(b) juveniles, are typical of the obstacles to placement and\nadoption faced by children voluntarily relinquished and accepted\ninto HHS custody.  I therefore decline the plaintiffs’ request to\nexpand the proposed class definition to include children in HHS\nlegal custody solely on the basis of voluntary relinquishment. \n3. Potential Subclasses Within the Plaintiffs’ Intended\nClass Definition.\nThe parties disagree on whether “alleged” 3(a) and 3(b)\njuveniles in HHS temporary custody, Native American 3(a) and 3(b)\njuveniles, and 3(a) and 3(b) juveniles “dually adjudicated” as\njuvenile offenders should be included in the class definition. \nFinally, the parties’ briefs discuss juveniles placed out-of-\nstate pursuant to the Interstate Compact on the Placement of\nChildren (“ICPC”), Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-1101 et seq, and the\nplaintiffs argue that such children should be included in the\nclass.  Filing 82 (Plaintiffs’ Reply Brief--Class Certification).\n81\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 86 of 199 - Page ID # 2855\np. 12.  The court must therefore determine whether these\ncategories of juveniles should be included in the class\ndefinition.\na. “Alleged” 3(a) and 3(b) Juveniles.   \nThe plaintiffs’ proposed class definition includes not only\nadjudicated, but also “alleged” 3(a) and 3(b) juveniles.  Alleged\n“abused and neglected” juveniles, and alleged status offenders\nmay be placed in HHS temporary legal custody prior to an\nadjudication.  Where a juvenile is endangered by his or her\nsurroundings, law enforcement may immediately remove the juvenile\nfrom those surroundings and place the child in HHS temporary\ncustody, but this temporary custody ceases after forty-eight\nhours absent a court order extending the temporary custody. \nDuring the forty-eight hour period, HHS’ authority is limited to\nproviding and supervising a temporary placement and consenting to\nany necessary medical, psychological, or psychiatric treatment of\nthe juvenile.  Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 43-248(3), 43-250(4), 43-254\n(LEXIS 2005); filing 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative\nCode–HHS), §§ 7-003.02, 8-001.01 (HHS-003600, 3612).  Where the\nState requests continued temporary custody, a factual statement\nin support of continued detention is submitted to the court by\naffidavit, and “the burden is upon the State to allege and prove\nin a detention hearing that the juvenile court should not place\nchildren with their other natural parent after the expiration of\nthe first 48 hours of emergency detention under Neb. Rev. Stat. §\n43-250(4) . . . during a period of temporary detention pending\nadjudication spawned by allegations under § 43-247(3)(a) against\ntheir custodial parent.”  In re Stephanie H., 10 Neb. App. 908,\n920, 639 N.W.2d 668, 679 (2002).  If the state fails to meet this\nburden, the child must be returned to his or her parents.\n82\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 87 of 199 - Page ID # 2856\nIn addition to abuse and neglect cases, law enforcement may\ntake a juvenile into temporary custody if there are reasonable\ngrounds to believe the juvenile is a runaway.  Such juveniles,\nand other status offenders, may be placed by the court (not law\nenforcement) in HHS temporary legal custody pending adjudication. \nNeb. Rev. Stat. §§  43-248(5), 43-250(4), 43-254(5)(LEXIS 2005). \nHHS obtains legal custody and provides services to 3(b) juveniles\nonly when the court has first conducted a hearing, determined\nthat a child is a status offender, and has ordered the\ndepartment’s involvement.  Filing 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska\nAdministrative Code–HHS), §§  1.006.05, 3-006.04 (HHS-003493,\n003513).\nUnder Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-278, an adjudication hearing\nshould be conducted within 90 days after a petition is filed.  In\nre Interest of Brianna B., 9 Neb. App. 529, 531, 614 N.W.2d 790,\n793 (2000)(holding that § 43-278 is directory, not mandatory in a\n3(a) abuse and neglect case); In re Interest of Brandy M., 250\nNeb. 510, 550 N.W.2d 17 (1996)(holding the 90-day provision of §\n43-278 is not directory, not mandatory, in 3(b) cases).  The\npurpose of the adjudication phase is to protect the interests of\nthe child.  In re Interest of Amber G., 250 Neb. 973, 980, 554\nN.W.2d 142, 148 (Neb. 1996).  If the State proves the allegations\nof the petition by a preponderance of the evidence at the\nadjudication stage, the juvenile court assumes jurisdiction over\nthe minor child.  In re Interest of Heather R. et al., 269 Neb.\n653, 663, 694 N.W.2d 659, 667 (2005).  If the State fails to meet\nthis burden, the juvenile court does not have jurisdiction over\nthe child and HHS temporary custody ceases.  Accordingly,\n“alleged” 3(a) or 3(b) juveniles are in HHS temporary custody for\na short period of time, likely less than four months.  Upon\n83\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 88 of 199 - Page ID # 2857\nadjudication, they will either be returned to parental custody\nbecause the State has failed to prove the § 43-247(3) allegations\nof its petition, or they are adjudicated and would therefore be\nincluded in the plaintiffs’ putative class as “adjudicated” 3(a)\nand 3(b) juveniles.  \nFor juveniles placed by the court in continuing HHS\ntemporary custody pending adjudication, HHS prepares and submits\nto the court a written report addressing the location of the\nchild and the child’s needs, but the underlying facts prompting\nHHS temporary custody are not addressed “so as not to compromise\nthe due process rights of the parents” pending adjudication. \nFiling 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative Code–HHS), § 8-001.07\n(HHS-003614).  The adjudication hearing affords parents the right\nto challenge the State’s claim that 3(a) or 3(b) circumstances\nexist and that such circumstances justify the State’s\nintervention in the parent-child relationship.  Prior to\nadjudication, HHS does not (and should not) engage in formulating\nlong-term case plans for exploring whether family reunification\nis a safe and viable option, or whether parental rights should be\nterminated, adoption pursued, or the child placed in long-term\nfoster care or an appropriate, permanent home as envisioned under\nthe Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act.  See Filing 64\n(Amended Complaint), ¶¶ 4(e), 108, 155-176, 184-186 (Second Cause\nof Action--AACWA). \nI conclude “alleged” 3(a) or 3(b) juveniles should not be\nincluded in the class definition.  The scope of the plaintiffs’\namended complaint, indeed the gravamen of their claim, focuses on\nharm caused by long-term, and “languishing” HHS legal custody\ncaused by systemic deficiencies in the system.  “Alleged” 3(a) or\n3(b) juveniles in HHS temporary custody who never become\n84\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 89 of 199 - Page ID # 2858\nadjudicated 3(a) or 3(b) juveniles are not subjected to this type\nof harm.  In other words, the following alleged “common question\nof fact,” \nc. [W]hether Defendants fail to provide appropriate\nand timely permanency planning and services for\nchildren in foster care to assure that they are\nproperly cared for and either safely reunited with\ntheir families or freed for adoption and promptly\nplaced in another permanent home, consistent with\napplicable law and reasonable professional\nstandards\n(filing 64, (Amended Complaint) ¶ 38(c)), does not apply to\n“alleged” 3(a) and 3(b) juveniles.  Though some of the harms\ndescribed in the plaintiffs’ amended complaint, (for example,\nexcessive stays in emergency shelters, filing 64 (Amended\nComplaint), ¶ 4(b)), may apply to alleged 3(a) or 3(b) juveniles\nin HHS temporary custody, the claims of the adjudicated 3(a) or\n3(b) juveniles are much broader in scope, and in many respects\ndissimilar, from the claims of “alleged” 3(a) and 3(b) juveniles.\nI further note that the plaintiffs’ allegations are not\nspecifically focused on “systemic failures” in providing care\nduring the brief temporary custody phase.  For example, the\nplaintiffs’ allegations do not focus on HHS’ responsiveness to\nallegations that a non-adjudicated child is being abused, or the\ninitial intake and assessment procedures followed by HHS in\nresponse to a new report of child abuse or neglect.  See filing\n73, ex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative Code–HHS), §§ 3-001 through 3-\n005.01 (HHS-003505-3510).  Absent determining if the “alleged”\n3(a) or 3(b) juveniles will be harmed by HHS policies or\nprocedures applicable to the temporary custody period, the court\nis left to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether “alleged”\n3(a) or 3(b) juveniles are provided adequate care.  Such an\n85\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 90 of 199 - Page ID # 2859\nindividualized inquiry is contrary to the purpose of class action\nlitigation and could serve to delay the proceedings.\nFinally, children described as “alleged” 3(a) or 3(b)\njuveniles are within a very fluid subset of the plaintiffs’\nproposed class.  Assuming a class is certified, some “alleged”\n3(a) or 3(b) juveniles would not remain in the class for even\nfour months, while most would likely become part of the class as\n“adjudicated” 3(a) or 3(b) juveniles.  Those few juveniles\nreleased from temporary HHS legal custody and never adjudicated\nare not left without recourse; they can pursue their own claims\nin the juvenile court through a guardian ad litem while in HHS\ntemporary custody, or through a parent or guardian once temporary\ncustody ceases.  \nFor all the foregoing reasons, I conclude children who were\nonly “alleged” to be 3(a) or 3(b) juveniles should not be\nincluded in the class definition.\nb.  Native American 3(a) and 3(b) Juveniles.\nThe defendants claim Native American children are “in a\ncategory of their own” for several reasons and should not be\nincluded in the class.  Filing 71, (Defendants’ Brief--Class\nCertification), p. 26.  The plaintiffs argue that although some\ncharacteristics of having Native American children in HHS legal\ncustody “are distinct, these distinctions do not have the effect\nof making the proposed class any more or less ascertainable.” \nWhile this is true, a class needs to be more than “ascertainable”\nto be certifiable.  I conclude that the processes and criteria\napplied to 3(a) and 3(b) Native American juveniles are so\n86\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 91 of 199 - Page ID # 2860\ndistinctive that these juveniles should not be included in the\nclass.\nThe care and placement of Native American children is\nsubject to the provisions of the Indian Child Welfare Act of\n1978, 25 U.S.C. 1901 et seq, and the Nebraska Indian Child\nWelfare Act (“NICWA”), Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-1501 et seq.  Where\nan alleged 3(a) or 3(b) Native American child is living within a\nreservation, the tribal court has exclusive jurisdiction over the\nchild; where the child does not live on the reservation, absent\ngood cause to retain juvenile court jurisdiction or rejection of\nthe case by a tribal court, Native American juveniles are\nadjudicated by a tribal court, not a juvenile court.  Neb. Rev.\nStat. § 43-1504(LEXIS 2005).  \nUnder NICWA, attempts must be made to secure foster and\nadoptive placement of Native American children in Native American\nhomes or institutions.  Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-1508 (LEXIS 2005). \nFor example, additional counseling must be provided to parents\nseeking to relinquish a Native American child.  See filing 73,\nex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative Code–HHS), § 8-004.01\n(HHS-003623).  Where parental rights have been terminated, in the\nabsence of good cause to deviate from the established placement\norder, adoptive placement of a Native American child must occur\nin the following order of preference:  1) a member of the child’s\nextended family; 2) other members of the child’s tribe; and 3)\nother Native American families.  Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-1508(LEXIS\n2005); filing 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative Code–HHS), § 6-\n002.15 (HHS-003558).  The child’s tribe retains authority to\nestablish a different order of preference so long as the\nplacement is the least restrictive placement appropriate to meet\nthe child’s particular needs.  Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-1508(LEXIS\n87\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 92 of 199 - Page ID # 2861\n2005); filing 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative Code–HHS), § 6-\n002.15 (HHS-003558).  \nWhenever possible, HHS staff use tribal social services when\nworking with Native American families.  Case planning and\nservices are based on the social and cultural standards of the\ntribe, with “active efforts” made to provide culturally relevant\nremedial and rehabilitative services to prevent the breakup of\nthe family and to reunify the child and family.  This “active\nefforts” standard is higher than a “reasonable efforts” standard\napplied to non-Native American 3(a) and 3(b) cases.  See filing\n73, ex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative Code–HHS), § 5-004.02D\n(HHS-003539). \nTo summarize, adjudicated 3(a) and 3(b) Native American\njuveniles are subject to the jurisdiction of the tribal rather\nthan juvenile court; their case planning is often performed by or\nin conjunction with tribal social services; foster and permanent\nplacements are subject to orders of preference not applicable to\nnon-Native American juveniles; and “active efforts” must be made\nto abide by these placement criteria.  In a case such as this,\nwhere the plaintiffs’ claims focus on HHS’ alleged failure to\nprovide adequate case planning, manage child placements, and\nprovide proper foster and adoptive homes to 3(a) and 3(b)\njuveniles, the legally required criteria applicable to only\nNative American children distinguish those children from non-\nNative American children.  None of the named plaintiffs is Native\nAmerican, and therefore none has been subjected to placements\nmade in accordance with the ICWA and NICWA.  The named plaintiffs\nhave failed to prove that their claims are typical of those which\ncould be brought by Native American juveniles.  I therefore\n88\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 93 of 199 - Page ID # 2862\nconclude that Native American juveniles should not be included in\nthe plaintiffs’ proposed class.\nc. “Dually Adjudicated” Juveniles.\nThe defendants also raise the issue of whether “dually\nadjudicated” juveniles should be included in the class.  I\nconclude that adjudicated 3(a) and/or 3(b) juveniles, who have\nalso been adjudicated as juvenile offenders and committed to the\nOffice of Juvenile Services, and who have not reached the age of\nnineteen or been legally discharged from the Office of Juvenile\nServices, (see Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-412(1)(LEXIS 2005)), should\nnot be members of the class.22  \nJuvenile offenders differ from 3(a) and 3(b) juveniles in\nthat juvenile offenders are subject to the Juvenile Service Act. \nNeb. Rev. Stat. § 43-401 et seq (LEXIS 2005).  The court enters\nan order stating the type of supervision, care, confinement, and\nrehabilitation services that must be provided to the juvenile\noffender, (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-408(2)(LEXIS 2005); filing 73,\nex. 7 (Nebraska Administrative Code–HHS), § 8-001.10 (HHS-003487,\n003614-15)), and based on the court’s order, HHS determines if\nthe juvenile offender should be placed in home care, an out-of-\nhome placement, or a Youth Rehabilitation Treatment Center.  Neb.\nRev. Stat. § 43-286(1)(b)(LEXIS 2005); filing 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska\n22Note that the defendants’ definition of “dually\nadjudicated” is broader than my use of this term.  The defendants\ndefine a “dually adjudicated juvenile” as “one that has been\nadjudicated in more than one category under statute and may be a\ncombination of any of the following classifications:  Section\n3(a) with abuse or neglect, Section 3(a) with dependency issues,\nSection 3(b) status offender, Section 3(c) mentally ill and\ndangerous, and/or a Section 1, Section 2, or Section 4 juvenile\noffender.”  \n89\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 94 of 199 - Page ID # 2863\nAdministrative Code–HHS), §§ 7-004.01B, 8.001.01 (HHS-003602,\nHHS-003615-16).  The efforts of HHS Juvenile Services Officers\nare directed at rehabilitating the juvenile offender and\nmaintaining public safety.  Filing 73, ex. 7 (Nebraska\nAdministrative Code–HHS), 1-2, § 5-001.01 at HHS-003484, 3532-33. \nThe plaintiffs have explained that juvenile offenders should\nnot be included in the putative class, apparently recognizing\nthat HHS and court procedures for supervision of juvenile\noffenders differ from those used for the protection of 3(a) and\n3(b) juveniles.  A placement chosen to protect a juvenile from\nhis or her surroundings may differ greatly from a placement\nchosen to protect the public from the juvenile or to impose\nconsequences for the juvenile’s illegal acts, yet both may be\nquite appropriate under the circumstances presented.  Where both\ncriteria are simultaneously applicable to the juvenile--that is,\nthe juvenile is not only an adjudicated 3(a) and 3(b) juvenile,\nbut also a juvenile offender committed to the Office of Juvenile\nServices--the placement criteria and considerations, and the\njuvenile court’s jurisdiction to order or prohibit placement\nchanges, (see e.g. In re Interest of Chelsey D., 14 Neb. App.\n392, 707 N.W.2d 798 (Neb. App. 2005), differs from that\napplicable to 3(a) or 3(b) juveniles who are not in HHS-OJS legal\ncustody.  Since alleged “systemic failures” in choosing or\nchanging placements is a significant issue in the plaintiffs’\nlawsuit, I conclude that adjudicated 3(a) and/or 3(b) juveniles\nwho are dually adjudicated as juvenile offenders should not be\nmembers of the class while they are committed to HHS-OJS custody.\n90\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 95 of 199 - Page ID # 2864\nd. Juveniles Placed Out-of-State.\nThe Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children\n(“ICPC”), Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-1101 et seq., allows HHS to place\n3(a) and 3(b) adjudicated juveniles in another state if an out-\nof-state placement serves the child’s best interests.  Though the\njuvenile is placed out-of-state, HHS remains the legal custodian\nand oversees the case assessment and management services provided\nby the receiving state.  Since HHS continues to be the ultimate\ndecision-maker with respect to placement of such juveniles, there\nis no reason to exclude such 3(a) and 3(b) juveniles from a class\nseeking to obtain court-ordered corrections in the placement\nprocess. \n4. The Re-Drafted Class Definition.\nBased on the foregoing analysis, the class definition has\nbeen redefined as:23\nAll children who: \n1) have not reached the age of majority as defined under\nNeb. Rev. Stat. § 43-245(1); \n2) are or will be in the legal custody of Nebraska’s\nDepartment of Health and Human Services but are not\ncommitted to its Office of Juvenile Services; \n3) have been adjudicated under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-\n247(3)(a) and/or § 43-247(3)(b); and \n4) are not Native American. \n23Unlike the plaintiffs’ proposed definition, this\ndefinition is sufficiently precise to clearly identify the class\nmembers without first evaluating each individual member’s case. \nChristina A. ex rel. Jennifer A. v. Bloomberg, 197 F.R.D. 664,\n667 (D.S.D. 2000).\n91\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 96 of 199 - Page ID # 2865\nThis definition is written to clarify the plaintiffs’\nintended class, but narrows the class to exclude those potential\nsubclasses which are discussed in the parties’ briefs and which\nshould or cannot be included in a class represented by the named\nplaintiffs.  The court must now consider whether the putative\nclass, as redefined, should be certified. \nB. Rule 23(a) Requirements.\nA class may “only be certified if the trial court is\nsatisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of\n[Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)] 23(a) have been\nsatisfied.”  Falcon, 457 U.S. at 161.  The purpose of this\nrigorous analysis is to protect unknown or unnamed potential\nclass members, and by definition those people who do not directly\nparticipate in the proceedings.  Hervey v. City of Little Rock, \n787 F.2d 1223, 1227 (8th Cir. 1986).\n1. Numerosity.\nThere were over 2500 non-Native American adjudicated 3(a)\nand 3(b) juveniles in HHS legal custody in December 2005.  The\nparties do not dispute, and I specifically find, that the \nnumerosity requirement of class certification has been met.\n2. Commonality.\nEvaluating commonality requires assessing the specific facts\npresented for the court’s review and determining whether common\nissues of law and fact exist among the plaintiffs.  Elizabeth M.,\n2006 WL 2346469, at *4-5 (8th Cir. August 15, 2006).\n92\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 97 of 199 - Page ID # 2866\nThe plaintiffs’ alleged common questions of fact are:\na.

Whether Defendants fail to provide foster children in\ntheir custody with legally required safety, protection\nand services necessary to prevent them from\ndeteriorating physically, psychologically, emotionally,\nor otherwise, while in state custody; \nc. Whether Defendants fail to provide appropriate and\ntimely permanency planning and services for children in\nfoster care to assure that they are properly cared for\nand either safely reunited with their families or freed\nfor adoption and promptly placed in another permanent\nhome, consistent with applicable law and reasonable\nprofessional standards; and \nd.

Filing 64 (Amended Complaint), ¶ 108.\nThe plaintiffs’ amended complaint alleges that defendants’\nsystemic deficiencies and pattern and practice of conduct raises\nthe following common questions of law:\na. Whether Defendants’ actions and inactions violate\nPlaintiffs’ rights under the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\nto be safe from harm while in state custody; \nb. Whether Defendants’ actions and inactions violate\nPlaintiffs’ rights under the Adoption Assistance and\nChild Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoption\nand Safe Families Act of 1997, and relevant federal\nregulations, to mandated foster care and adoption\nservices and foster care maintenance payments; \nc. Whether Defendants’ actions and inactions violate\nPlaintiffs’ rights under the Early and Periodic\nScreening, Diagnosis and Treatment program of the\nMedicaid Act, and relevant federal regulations; \nd. Whether Defendants’ actions and inactions violate\nPlaintiffs’ rights to familial association under the\nFirst, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constitution; and \ne. Whether Defendants’ actions and inactions breach\ncontractual rights enjoyed by Plaintiffs as third-party\nbeneficiaries to Nebraska’s State Plan contracts with\nthe federal government pursuant to Titles IV-B and IV-E\nof the Social Security Act.\nFiling 64 (Amended Complaint), ¶ 39. \nThe plaintiffs urge that these common questions of law and\nfact warrant a finding of commonality.  The defendants, on the\nother hand, claim 3(a) and 3(b) juveniles present with vastly\n94\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 99 of 199 - Page ID # 2868\ndiffering needs, no two children are alike, each child must be\nevaluated individually and provided with HHS services in\naccordance with that evaluation, and there is no common question\nof law or fact that binds the plaintiffs together as a class.  \nCommonality under Rule 23(a)(2) may be found “where the\nquestion of law linking the class members is substantially\nrelated to the resolution of the litigation even though the\nindividuals are not identically situated.”  Paxton v. Union\nNational Bank, 688 F.2d 552, 561 (8th Cir. 1982).  Where the\nplaintiffs are challenging institutional conditions, policies and\npractices, and not their application to each individual member of\nthe class, the fact that each member of the class may be affected\ndifferently by the policies does not necessarily preclude a\nfinding of commonality.  Christina A. ex rel. Jennifer A. v.\nBloomberg, 197 F.R.D. 664, 667 (D.S.D. 2000)(certifying class of\n“all juveniles who are now or in the future will be confined at\nthe State Training School in Plankinton” who challenged the\nconstitutionality of the institution’s policies on the use of\nexcessive force).

Rule 23(a)(2) is satisfied when the “legal\nquestion linking the class members is substantially related to\nthe resolution of the litigation.”  DeBoer v. Mellon Mortg.

Perdue, 218 F.R.D. 277, 300-302 (N.D.Ga.\n2003)(relying on Baby Neal and specifically rejecting J.B.).24 \nThus, there appears to be split in the circuits on this issue,\nthough the differing outcomes may in reality only reflect the\nhighly case-specific nature of motions to certify a class.   \n24The plaintiffs cite to numerous cases where a class was\ncertified, (see Filing 13 (Plaintiffs’ Brief--Class\nCertification), pp. 11-12 & n. 4.), but the persuasive value of\nthese opinions is very limited.  \nIn Jeanine B. by Blondis v. Thompson, 877 F.Supp. 1268, 1287\n(E.D.Wis. 1995), the State defendants requested the formation of\nsubclasses but did not oppose formation of the class itself.  \nThe following cases were class action lawsuits, but the\nopinions do not discuss whether a class should be certified under\nRule 23:  Lynch v. Dukakis, 719 F.2d 504, 506 n. 1 (1st Cir.\n1983); LaShawn A. v. Dixon, 762 F.Supp. 959, 960 (D.D.C. 1991);\nB.H. v. Johnson, 715 F.Supp. 1387, 1389 (N.D.Ill. 1989); L.J. By\nand Through Darr v.

Bernstein, 499 F.Supp. 980, 992-993 (D.C.N.Y.\n1980), certified a class of children who were allegedly denied\nplacement because of their race and religion, but Wilder predated\nGeneral Tel. Co. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 155 (1982), and the\ncontinuing value of its analysis is suspect. \nCarr v. Wilson-Coker, 203 F.R.D. 66, 67 (D.Conn. 2001)\ncertified a class of “all individuals in Connecticut who are or\nwill be eligible for Medicaid managed care [dental] benefits, and\nare or will be seeking dental health services,” alleging the\nstate’s systemic deficiencies resulted in a lack of access to\noral health services in violation of the EPSDT.  The scope of\nallegations in Carr was much narrower than the allegations raised\nin this action, and on the issue of commonality, Carr’s analysis\nof relevant case law discussing the requirements of Rule 23(a)(2)\nis very limited.\n96\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 101 of 199 - Page ID # 2870\nIn Baby Neal, the Third Circuit held the district court\nabused its discretion by refusing to certify a class where the\nplaintiffs were “challenging common conditions and practices\nunder a unitary regime,” . . . “the children in the class are\nsubject to the risk that they will suffer from the same\ndeprivations resulting from the DHS’s alleged violations,”. . .\n“all of their injuries alleged here would be cured if DHS\nremedied the systemic deficiencies,” and “as the children\nchallenge the scheme for the provision of child welfare services,\ntheir claims share a common legal basis.”  Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at\n60.  Baby Neal held that since the complaint did not seek\ndamages, factual differences among the plaintiffs were largely\nirrelevant.  Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 61.\nThe children challenge DHS's pattern of conduct, which\nis subjecting them all to violations of their statutory\nand constitutional rights.  Because of the dearth of\ntrained caseworkers, for example, DHS (allegedly) fails\nto investigate reports of abuse and neglect promptly or\nadequately and fails to reliably provide the children\nin its care with written case plans, with appropriate\nplacements, with proper care while in custody, and with\nperiodical dispositional hearings.  Similar violations\nof the rights of children in custody to be free from\nharm can (allegedly) be traced to the scarcity of\nproperly trained foster parents or to DHS's lack of an\nadequate information system.\nBaby Neal, 43 F.3d at 62.  Baby Neal specifically noted that a\ntrial would not require an individualized inquiry into a vast\nnetwork of institutions because only Philadelphia’s child welfare\nsystem was at issue.  Baby Neal further held:\n[T]he [district] court failed to give effect to the\nproper role of (b)(2) class actions in remedying\nsystemic violations of basic rights of large and often\namorphous classes. . . .

Hart v. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280\n(10th Cir. 1999), the Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court’s\norder denying certification of a class comprised of “[a]ll\nchildren who are now or in the future will be (a) in or at risk\nof State custody and (b) determined by defendants and/or their\nagents to have any form of mental and/or developmental disability\nfor which they require some kind of therapeutic services or\nsupport.”  The Tenth Circuit specifically noted that its\nconclusion differed from that reached in Baby Neal in a similar\ncase.  J.B., 186 F.3d at 1289 n. 5.\nIn J.B., the plaintiffs, acting through next friends, sought\nstructural reform of New Mexico’s system for evaluating and\ntreating children with mental and developmental disabilities in\nits custody.  The court specifically acknowledged that based on\nthe allegations of the named plaintiffs, New Mexico’s child\nwelfare system was having “terrible difficulties providing the\nchildren with the kind of care and treatment they deserve.” \nJ.B., 186 F.3d at 1282.  The plaintiffs alleged “systemic\ndeficiencies” existed in the system such that the plaintiffs’\nfederal constitutional and statutory rights were being violated. \nJ.B. affirmed the district court’s conclusion that no common\nquestion of fact existed where the children’s entry into the\nsystem, particular placements, and movement within the system\ndiffered drastically from person to person. “Other than all being\ndisabled in some way and having had some sort of contact with New\n98\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 103 of 199 - Page ID # 2872\nMexico’s child welfare system, no common factual link joins these\nplaintiffs.”  J.B., 186 F.3d at 1289. \nThough the plaintiffs in J.B. claimed “systemic failures in\nthe defendants’ child welfare delivery system deny all members of\nthe class access to legally-mandated services which plaintiffs\nneed because of their disabilities,” J.B. concluded there was no\n“discrete legal question” applicable to all class members. \nWe refuse to read an allegation of systematic failures\nas a moniker for meeting the class action requirements. \nRule 23(a) requires a common question of law or fact. \nFor a common question of law to exist, the putative\nclass must share a discrete legal question of some\nkind.  \nJ.B., 186 F.3d at 1289.  See also Reinholdson, 2002 WL 31026580,\nat *8(“The reciting of the word “systemic” in mantra-like fashion\nthroughout the briefing and argument does not overcome the\nprerequisites to class certification.”).  “Given the complex\nfacts and legal issues involved in this case, we cannot say the\ndistrict court abused its discretion when it refused to\ncharacterize plaintiffs’ claims as a systematic violation.” \nJ.B., 186 F.3d at 1289.

Negley, 626 F.2d 600, 603\n(7th Cir. 1980)(affirming denial of a plaintiff class consisting\nof children entitled to a public education who have learning\ndisabilities and who are not properly identified and/or who are\nnot receiving special education). \nFinally, Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372, 375 (2d Cir.\n1997), cited by the plaintiffs herein (see filing 13 (Plaintiffs’\nBrief--Class Certification), p. 11), affirmed certification of a\nclass similar to that requested in this action, but it did so\nwith noted reservation and issued specific instructions to the\n99\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 104 of 199 - Page ID # 2873\ntrial court.  Marisol A. affirmed the district court’s\ncertification of a class composed of “[a]ll children who are or\nwill be in the custody of the New York City Administration for\nChildren’s Services (“ACS”), and those children who, while not in\nthe custody of ACS, are or will be at risk of neglect or abuse\nand whose status is or should be known to ACS.”  As in this case,\nthe named plaintiffs alleged the child welfare system\ninadequately trained and supervised foster parents, failed to\nproperly investigate reports of suspected neglect and abuse,\nunconscionably delayed removing children from abusive homes, and\nwas unable to secure appropriate placements for adoption.  The\nclaimed deficiencies implicated various statutory,\nconstitutional, and regulatory schemes.  The trial court\nidentified the common question of law as “whether each child has\na legal entitlement to the services of which that child is being\ndeprived,” and it identified the common question of fact as\n“whether defendants systematically have failed to provide these\nlegally mandated services.”  Marisol A., 126 F.3d at 377. \nThe Second Circuit identified the “core issue” presented as\n“whether, by conceptualizing the common legal and factual\nquestions at this high level of abstraction (or, understood\ndifferently, by aggregating all of the plaintiffs’ claims into\none ‘super-claim’), the district court abused the discretion\ngranted it by Rule 23 to provide for the orderly and efficient\nmaintenance of this lawsuit.”  Marisol A., 126 F.3d at 377.  In\naffirming the district court’s certification of a class, the\nSecond Circuit explained that although it believed “the district\ncourt is near the boundary of the class action device,” it was\n“not prepared to say that it has crossed into forbidden\nterritory.” \n100\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 105 of 199 - Page ID # 2874\nMarisol A. found no abuse of discretion “at this stage of\nthe litigation,” but further held that the class was, in reality,\ncomposed of subclasses consisting of smaller groups of children\nwith separate and discrete legal claims based on one or more\nspecific alleged deficiencies of the child welfare system. \nMarisol A., 126 F.3d at 378-79.  It ordered the trial court to\n“engage in a rigorous analysis of the plaintiffs’ legal claims\nand factual circumstances in order to ensure that appropriate\nsubclasses are identified, that each subclass is tied to one or\nmore suitable representatives, and that each subclass satisfies\nRule 23(b)(2),” and specifically ordered the district court to\n“identify (1) the discrete legal claims which are at issue, (2)\nthe named plaintiffs who are aggrieved under each individual\nclaim at issue, and (3) the subclasses that each named plaintiff\nrepresents.”  Marisol A., 126 F.3d at 379. \nHaving reviewed the law and its application to the\nallegations of plaintiffs’ amended complaint and the evidentiary\nsubmissions, I conclude the plaintiffs’ intended class lacks\nsufficient commonality for class certification.  A close reading\nof the amended complaint reveals that named plaintiffs each\nallege the following factual claim:  Under the State’s current\n“systemically deficient” policies and procedures, the State fails\nto adequately supervise them or the placements they are in, and\nfails to develop and implement appropriate permanency plans for\ntheir benefit, instead moving them from placement to placement,\nsome of which are harmful, unsafe, or inappropriate in the\ncontext of their individual needs.25  Thus, the claim is that due\n25There are several specific claims not shared by all named\nplaintiffs; for example, whether HHS paid foster care providers \ngrossly inadequate amounts, (Carson P. and Danielle D., filing 64\n(Amended Complaint), ¶¶ 55, 57, 71, 76); improperly withheld\nvisitation with family members, (Carson P., Paulette V., and\n101\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 106 of 199 - Page ID # 2875\nto a lack of monetary resources, caseworkers, and more and better\nplacement options, and the State’s reluctance to pursue\ntermination of parental rights, the named plaintiffs are\nlanguishing in the child welfare system rather than living a\nnormal family life.  No doubt the concern is both valid and\nheartbreaking, but I disagree with Baby Neal’s holding that\nbecause injunctive relief is requested, “the factual differences\n[among the class members] are largely irrelevant.”  Baby Neal, 43\nF.3d at 61.   \nThough the plaintiffs and defendants agree this is a\n23(b)(2) case, the court must still consider whether the\nplaintiffs’ intended class is sufficiently cohesive to pursue a\n23(b)(2) class claim.  Unlike Rule 23(b)(3), the language of Rule\nDanielle D., filing 64 (Amended Complaint), ¶¶ 54, 57, 59, 68,\n75, 76); inadequately trained, prepared, or informed foster\nparents, (Carson P., Cheryl H., and Hannah W., filing 64 (Amended\nComplaint), ¶¶ 56, 78, 79, 101, 103); failed to provide necessary\ntransitional living training, (Paulette V. and Cheryl H., filing\n64 (Amended Complaint), Filing 64 (Amended Complaint), ¶¶ 58, 67,\n80, 81); placed children in emergency shelters and other\ntemporary facilities for excessive periods of time (Paulette V.\nand Cheryl H., filing 64 (Amended Complaint), ¶¶ 65, 68, 78, 81);\nand failed to provide emotional support for foster children\nmoving from one placement to another, (Bobbi W., filing 64\n(Amended Complaint), ¶ 94.  While the presence of individual\n“uncommon” claims will not defeat an otherwise appropriate class,\nthey do punctuate the diverse circumstances of the individuals\nwithin plaintiffs’ intended class.  See also Marisol A., 126 F.3d\nat 378-79 (affirming class certification but requiring the court\nto create subclasses for children with discrete legal claims\nbased on specific alleged deficiencies in the system).\nThe amended complaint also alleges the state placed children\nin overcrowded foster homes, (filing 64 (Amended Complaint), ¶¶ 4\n(d), 5(a), 109, 122); and underused institutional placement\noptions and therapeutic foster homes.  Filing 64 (Amended\nComplaint), ¶¶ 113, 118.  The amended complaint does not\nspecifically allege that any of the named plaintiffs were\nsubjected to these types of alleged misconduct. \n102\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 107 of 199 - Page ID # 2876\n23(b)(2) does not specifically state the court must find\n“questions of law or fact common to the members of the class\npredominate over any questions affecting only individual\nmembers,” (Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), but determining whether a\nRule 23(b)(2) class action can be pursued depends, in part, on\nthe level of commonality found under Rule 23(a)(2).26  The Eighth\nCircuit recently held:\nAlthough Rule 23(b)(2) contains no predominance or\nsuperiority requirements, class claims thereunder must\nbe cohesive. . . .  Because “unnamed members are bound\nby the action without the opportunity to opt out” of a\nRule 23(b)(2) class, even greater cohesiveness\ngenerally is required than in a Rule 23(b)(3) class.  A\n“suit could become unmanageable and little value would\nbe gained in proceeding as a class action . . . if\nsignificant individual issues were to arise\nconsistently.” \nIn re St. Jude Medical, Inc., 425 F.3d 1116, 1121-1122 (8th Cir.\n2005)(citing Barnes v.

Compare Baby Neal,\n43 F.3d at 59-60 (holding the Rule 23(b)(2) injunctive class\nprovision was “designed for . . . a numerous and often\nunascertainable or amorphous class of persons.” . . . “Although\nthe [trial] court took cognizance of cases holding that common\nquestions need only exist--not predominate--for (b)(2) actions,\nit nevertheless proceeded to demand higher demonstrations of\ncommonality and typicality than the rule requires.”), and Kenny\nA. ex rel.

Injuries\nremedied through (b)(2) actions are really group, as opposed to\nindividual injuries.”  St. Jude, 425 F.3d at 1121-22(reversing\ncertification of a 23(b)(2) medical monitoring class where the\nneed for monitoring and treatment depended on individual\ncircumstances and medical histories). \nThe plaintiffs have challenged a whole host of actions and\nthe various affects of those actions on a whole host of wards. \nThey challenge all, or nearly all, aspects of Nebraska’s child\nwelfare system.  There is no benchmark for determining when the\nState’s policies--considered as a whole--or its allocation of\nfunds--considered as a whole--have reached the “reasonable\nprofessional judgment” standard for the benefit all members of\nthe class, as opposed to the individually named plaintiffs.  \nThe lack of commonality within the putative class is\nevidenced by the lack of any suggested and specific request for\ninjunctive relief.  Although the plaintiffs argue that discovery\nis needed before they can determine what specific relief to\nrequest, not even a minimal effort has been made to identify what\nmeasures the state should implement to address their needs or the\nneeds of the class.  The likely reason is the substantial\ndifficulty (and perhaps impossibility) of identifying any\nspecific form of relief that will benefit all members of the\nhighly diverse putative class.  Should the court enter an order\ngranting the relief requested in the plaintiffs’ amended\ncomplaint--that is, an order to obey the law--the injunction is\nunenforceable.  Language in an injunction that essentially\n104\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 109 of 199 - Page ID # 2878\nrequires a party to obey the law is overbroad and unenforceable\nbecause those against whom the injunction is issued must “receive\nfair and precisely drawn notice of what the injunction actually\nprohibits.”  Calvin Klein Cosmetics Corp. v. Parfums de Coeur,\nLtd., 824 F.2d 665, 669 (8th Cir. 1987).\nAs is evidenced by the histories and allegations of the\nnamed plaintiffs, they have entered Nebraska’s child welfare\nsystem for vastly different reasons with highly specific and\nchallenging needs.  They all have a court-approved permanency\nplan; but they challenge whether those plans are appropriate. \nThey are each in “placements;” but they challenge the quality,\nsuitability, and adequacy of supervision in those placements. \nThey each have a caseworker and have been contacted by the\ncaseworker; they challenge those contacts as insufficient to\ndetermine their needs and safety, or support sound placement\nrecommendations and decisions. \nWhat the named plaintiffs ultimately seek is a court order\nrequiring the investment of funds and the implementation of State\npolicies that will lead to the exercise of “reasonable\nprofessional judgment” in developing permanency plans, making\nplacements, supervising children within its custody, and finding\nthem homes.  See filing 64 (Amended Complaint), ¶¶ 38(a), 38(c),\n57, 68, 76, 81, 89, 98, 106, 107, 108, 130, 133, 137, 147, 154,\n155, 174, 178, 183, 190, 192.  Were the court to enter an\ninjunction requiring the defendants to implement policies\ndirected at exercising “reasonable professional judgment” on\nbehalf of each child, any later attempt of any child seeking to\nenforce the judgment, or to find the State in contempt, would\nrequire this court to review that child’s unique circumstances. \nIn such circumstances, there is nothing to be gained by\n105\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 110 of 199 - Page ID # 2879\npermitting class certification because, due to lack of\ncohesiveness within the class, “significant individual issues\n[will] arise consistently.”  In re St. Jude Medical, 425 F.3d at\n1122.\nThe individualized nature of the harm experienced by\nchildren in Nebraska’s child welfare system cannot be hidden\nbehind the term “systemic deficiencies.”  J.B., 186 F.3d at 1289. \nEach child in HHS custody is entitled to the State’s reasonable\nprofessional judgment in placement planning and allocating State\nmonetary and human resources to meet that goal, and therefore, on\nan abstract level, the class is cohesively bound by common issues\nof law and fact.  However, an injunctive and declaratory remedy\ncannot globally ensure that reasonable professional judgment is\nfollowed on behalf of not only the named plaintiffs, but unnamed\nand future members of the class with differing individual needs\nand concerns.  Indeed, assuming this court granted injunctive\nrelief as requested by the named plaintiffs, it is certainly\nforeseeable that the State may comply with the terms of that\ninjunction, by spending more or re-allocating resources to meet\nthe needs of the named plaintiffs and/or other members of the\nclass, and yet still fail to provide the level of supervision and\nplacement planning owed to a specific individual child.\nThe circumstances of each child in HHS custody remain a\nparamount consideration.  The members of the putative class are\nhighly diverse in terms of needs to be met and services to be\nprovided by HHS.  The plaintiffs’ allegation of “systemic”\nviolations does not create a common issue of fact within this\npurported class.  When the resolution of a “common” legal issue\nis dependent on factual determinations that will be different for\neach putative class plaintiff, a common issue of law does not\n106\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 111 of 199 - Page ID # 2880\nexist for the purposes of Rule 23(a)(2).  Elizabeth M., 2006 WL\n2346469, at *5 (8th Cir. August 15, 2006); Reinholdson, 2002 WL\n31026580 at *8.  See also Laurie Q. v. Contra Costa County, 304\nF. Supp. 2d 1185, 1198-99 (N.D.Cal. 2004)(noting continued\ncertification was doubtful where the court warned at the outset\nthat decertification was likely “if the adequacy of maintenance\npayments breaks down into particularized individual inquiries,”\nand the plaintiffs were now arguing the plaintiffs’ needs must be\nassessed individually).\n3. Typicality. \nTypicality exists if there are other members of the class\nwho “have the same or similar grievances as the plaintiff.” \nAlpern v. UtiliCorp United, Inc., 84 F.3d 1525, 1540 (8th Cir.\n1996).  Factual differences in the plaintiffs’ claims will not\nnormally preclude class certification “if the claim arises from\nthe same event or course of conduct as the class claims, and\ngives rise to the same legal or remedial theory.”  Id.  \nThe plaintiffs’ putative class is diverse, both in\nmembership and claims specific members can raise.  The proposed\nclass includes children ranging in age from newborn to nineteen,\nwhose have entered HHS legal custody because they were abused and\nneglected, abandoned, homeless, destitute, unable to be cared for\nby their parents, or uncontrollable, wayward, or truant. \nThe named plaintiffs were all adjudicated under 3(a), and\neach initially entered the child welfare system by removal from\ntheir homes for their protection.  Children who are homeless and\ndestitute (but not abused or neglected) or whose parents cannot\ncare for them, and children who are rebelliously truant, wayward,\n107\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 112 of 199 - Page ID # 2881\nand uncontrollable likely do not share the same interest (or\nperhaps any interest) in the named plaintiffs’ goal of focusing\nstate and federal resources on locating foster and adoptive homes\nfor long-term and permanent out-of-home placement.  Children who\nare abused and neglected need safety, care, and protection from\ntheir family; homeless and destitute families and their children\n(3(a) dependents) need a home where they can live together;\nchildren with parents who are physically unable to care for them\n(3(a) dependants) may need out-of-home placement with adequate\nparental and family visitation, but not termination of parental\nrights and adoption; parents of children who are wayward, truant,\nor uncontrollable need (and have usually asked for) state\nassistance in raising their children, preferably within the home. \nThe plaintiffs have the burden of proving the other members\nof the proposed class possess claims similar to theirs.  Alpern,\n84 F.3d at 1540.  As individuals, the named plaintiffs are not\nsimilar to one another.  Even acting collectively for policy\nchange, the named plaintiffs have failed to prove they “have the\nsame or similar grievances” of other members of the putative\nclass such that their claims for relief are typical of the class\nas a whole.  See e.g. Elizabeth M., 2006 WL 2346469, at *5 (8th\nCir. August 15, 2006)(holding Rule 23(a) requirements were not\nmet where the complaint alleged defendants violated class\nmembers’ constitutional and statutory rights by failing “to\nprovide appropriate essential services necessary for the\ntreatment, habilitation, rehabilitation, and amelioration of the\nPlaintiffs’ mental illnesses and/or developmental disabilities,”\nand “pleaded a laundry list of desired policy changes, alleged\nthat their injuries are caused by the absence of these policies,\nand asserted that Rule 23's requirements are satisfied because\n108\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 113 of 199 - Page ID # 2882\nall class members live in facilities where the desired policies\nare absent.”).\n4. Adequacy of Representation/Dismissal for Lack of\nStanding.\nThe adequacy of representation issue is of critical\nimportance in all class actions, and the court is under an\nobligation to pay careful attention to the Rule 23(a)(4)\nprerequisite in every case.  Vervaecke v. Chiles, Heider & Co.,\nInc., 578 F.2d 713, 719 (8th Cir. 1978).  To satisfy the\nrequirement of Rule 23(a)(4), the plaintiffs must show:\n(1) the representatives and their attorneys are able and\nwilling to prosecute the action competently and\nvigorously, and \n(2)  each representative's interests are sufficiently\nsimilar to those of the class such that it is unlikely\nthat their goals and viewpoints will diverge. \nHervey v. City of Little Rock, 787 F.2d 1223, 1230 (8th Cir.\n1986); Paxton, 688 F.2d at 562-63.27  The defendants claim the\nnamed plaintiffs cannot adequately represent the class because\ntheir interests and claims are significantly different from those\nof the class, (filing 71 (Defendants’ Brief--Class\nCertification), p. 50), and their next friends are mere\n“figureheads” who have neither the incentive nor the ability   \n27The factors in determining adequacy of representation by\nclass counsel include capability, experience, and potential for\nconflicts of interest.  Wrighten v. Metropolitan Hospitals, 726\nF.2d 1346 (9th Cir. 1984).  Although inadequate legal\nrepresentation precludes a finding of adequate class\nrepresentation, the defendants concede that counsel for the\nputative class is competent, and I find no evidence to the\ncontrary.\n109\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 114 of 199 - Page ID # 2883\nto direct this litigation.  Filing 71 (Defendants’ Brief--Class\nCertification), p. 53.  \nThe defendants’ have also moved to dismiss under Rule\n12(b)(1) on the basis of lack of standing.  “In every federal\ncase, the party bringing the suit must establish standing to\nprosecute the action.”  Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow,\n542 U.S. 1, 11 (2004).  The question of standing is “whether the\nlitigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the\ndispute or of particular issues.”  Elk Grove, 542 U.S. at 11. \nThere are two separate areas of inquiry for determining standing: \n“Article III standing, which enforces the Constitution's case or\ncontroversy requirement, . . . and prudential standing, which\nembodies judicially self-imposed limits on the exercise of\nfederal jurisdiction.”  Elk Grove, 542 U.S. at 11 (internal\ncitations omitted).  The State raises both grounds for arguing\nthis case must be dismissed for lack of standing.\nUnder the Article III limitation on standing, “[t]he\nplaintiff must show that the conduct of which he complains\nhas caused him to suffer an ‘injury in fact’ that a favorable\njudgment will redress.”  Elk Grove, 542 U.S. at 11.  The\ndefendants allege the named plaintiffs lack standing because they\nrequest injunctive and declaratory relief, but they face no real\nand imminent threat of harm, either because they are now adults,\nor because, at the time this case was filed, their “needs for\nsafety, health and well being [were] being met,” (filing 72\n(Defendants’ Brief–Motion to Dismiss), p. 54).\nThe defendants also claim the case must be dismissed under\nthe “prudential dimensions of the standing doctrine.”  They claim\nthe self-appointed next friends have only an ideological stake in\n110\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 115 of 199 - Page ID # 2884\nthis litigation and are not appropriate next friends to pursue\nlitigation on the named plaintiffs’ behalf.  “[P]rudential\nstanding encompasses ‘the general prohibition on a litigant's\nraising another person’s legal rights. . . . ’”  Elk Grove, 542\nU.S. at 11 (quoting Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984). \n“Without such limitations--closely related to Art. III concerns\nbut essentially matters of judicial self-governance--the courts\nwould be called upon to decide abstract questions of wide public\nsignificance even though other governmental institutions may be\nmore competent to address the questions and even though judicial\nintervention may be unnecessary to protect individual rights.” \nElk Grove, 542 U.S. at 11 (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490,\n500 (1975)).  A named party “is not a proper representative of\nthe class where he himself lacks standing to pursue the claim.” \nHall v. Lhaco, Inc., 140 F.3d 1190, 1196 (8th Cir. 1998). \nFinally, the defendants argue that since a class\nrepresentative must “possess the same interest and suffer the\nsame injury” as the class, (Falcon, 457 U.S. at 156), named\nplaintiffs who have reached the age of nineteen cannot be class\nrepresentatives--their claims are moot and became moot before a\nclass was certified. \n \nTherefore, the defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of\nstanding, the determination of mootness for claims brought by\nnamed plaintiffs who are adults, and the question of whether the\nnamed plaintiffs have proven they can adequately represent the\nclass, (Rule 23(a)(4)), are interrelated.  See e.g. Elizabeth M.,\n2006 WL 2346469, at *3 (8th Cir. August 15, 2006).  These issues\nwill be addressed together in this report and recommendation. \n111\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 116 of 199 - Page ID # 2885\na. Adequacy of Representation/Lack of Article III\nStanding--the Named Plaintiffs.\ni. Adequacy of Representation/Mootness:  Cheryl H.\nand Paulette V.\nCheryl H. and Paulette V. have reached the age of nineteen\nand are now adults under Nebraska law.  The defendants claim that\nnamed plaintiffs who are adults will no longer be subjected to\nthe alleged harm caused by the Nebraska child welfare system,28\nand cannot be class representatives because they are no longer\nmembers of the class.  Filing 71 (Defendants’ Brief--Class\nCertification), p. 52.  They further argue that once a named\nplaintiff becomes an adult, any claim for injunctive relief is\nmoot, no justiciable controversy exists, and the claim must be\ndismissed for lack of standing.  Filing 72 (Defendants’ Brief--\nMotion to Dismiss), p. 55-57.  \nIn response, the plaintiffs acknowledge that once a named\nplaintiff reached the age of nineteen, they are no longer in HHS\nlegal custody.  They argue, however, that Cheryl H. and Paulette\nV. should remain named plaintiffs in this litigation under the\ndoctrine of “capable of repetition, but evading review.”  Filing\n82 (Plaintiffs’ Reply Brief–Class Certification), pp. 37-41.  The\ndoctrine has “been applied where the named plaintiff does have a\npersonal stake at the outset of the lawsuit, and where the claim\n28Only Cheryl H. is identified as an adult in the motions\nand briefs; Paulette V. is identified as nearing adulthood.  \nFiling 71 (Defendants’ Brief--Class Certification), p. 52. \nHowever, Paulette V. turned nineteen after the motions and briefs\nwere filed.

If the “litigant faces some\nlikelihood of becoming involved in the same controversy in the\nfuture, vigorous advocacy can be expected to continue.” \nGeraghty, 445 U.S. at 398.  Moreover, some claims are so\n“inherently transitory that the trial court will not have even\nenough time to rule on a motion for class certification before\nthe proposed representative's individual interest expires.”\nGeraghty, 445 U.S. at 398-399. \nThe amended complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive\nrelief.  However, by operation of law and based solely on their\nage (not on the discretion of any HHS representative), Cheryl H.\nand Paulette V. are not now and never will be in HHS legal\ncustody again.  They face no present or future risk of exposure\nto HHS’ allegedly deficient policies and procedures.  Therefore,\nPaulette V. and Cheryl H. cannot show they “face[] some\nlikelihood of becoming involved in the same controversy in the\nfuture,” because their claims for injunctive relief “may arise\nagain.”  Geraghty, 445 U.S. at 398. \nThe plaintiffs argue that “foster care” claims are\n“inherently transitory” and therefore the “capable of repetition,\nbut evading review” doctrine must be applied on that basis. \nHowever, the plaintiffs have not cited and the court has not\nfound any law stating that the claims at issue in this litigation\nare considered sufficiently “transitory” to invoke the\napplication of the doctrine.29   To the contrary, both Cheryl H.\n29Claims specifically addressing HHS response to initial\nreports of child abuse or its conduct or inactions during\n113\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 118 of 199 - Page ID # 2887\nand Paulette V. allege they were allowed to “languish” or were \nrequired to remain in HHS legal custody for many years.  Filing\n64 (Amended Complaint), ¶¶ 58-66, 78-80.  The evidence submitted\nin this case demonstrates that the claims of Cheryl H. and\nPaulette V., as well as the other named plaintiffs, are not\ntransitory in nature.  \nCheryl H. and Paulette V. were juveniles in HHS legal\ncustody when this litigation was filed, but they are now adults. \nAs such, they have neither a current nor a potential future claim\nfor injunctive relief against HHS arising from its allegedly\ndeficient child welfare system.  A case can become moot if \nevents occur after it was filed that make it absolutely clear\nthat the allegedly wrongful behavior at issue in the lawsuit\ncannot reasonably be expected to occur again.  Friends of the\nEarth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528\nU.S. 167, 189 (2000).  Since Cheryl H. and Paulette V. will not\n“suffer a future injury that will be remedied” by the relief\nrequested in this lawsuit, their claims are moot.  Elizabeth M.,\n2006 WL 2346469, at *3 (8th Cir. August 15, 2006).  Their\ncontinued presence in the class “poses a substantial risk to the\n‘efficiency and economy of litigation which is a principal\npurpose’ behind the class action device.”  Elizabeth M., 2006 WL\ntemporary HHS custody pending a 3(a) adjudication may be\nsufficiently “transitory” for application of the doctrine.  But\nas previously explained, the amended complaint does not allege\nthe HHS fails to initial claims of child abuse, and the amended\ncomplaint does not specifically challenge HHS policies applicable\nto pre-adjudication temporary custody of children.  Accordingly,\neven if the doctrine of “capable of repetition, but evading\nreview” is applicable to claims challenging HHS temporary custody\nprocedures, (a determination I need not and do not make), it is\nnot applicable under the facts of this case.\n114\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 119 of 199 - Page ID # 2888\n2346469, at *3 (8th Cir.

For the same reasons, their claims for\ninjunctive and declaratory relief should be dismissed.30  See\ne.g. Elizabeth M., 2006 WL 2346469, at *3 (8th Cir.

Lack of Article III Standing:  Carson P., Danielle D.,\nJacob P., Bobbi W., and Hannah A.\nThe defendants also argue that since the lawsuit requests\ninjunctive relief, and each of the remaining named plaintiffs--\nCarson P., Danielle D., Jacob P., Bobbi W., and Hannah A--were in\nsuitable placements approved by the juvenile court when this case\nwas filed, they cannot represent the class because no case or\ncontroversy existed when the case was filed, and the case must be\ndismissed for lack of standing.  Filing 72 (Defendants’\nBrief–Motion to Dismiss), p. 54-55.  The defendants claim that\n“none of the named Plaintiffs faces a real and immediate threat\nof future injury, and any relief this Court could grant would not\nbenefit the named Plaintiffs.”  Filing 72 (Defendants’\nBrief–Motion to Dismiss), p. 54-55.  In contrast, the plaintiffs\nargue that this court cannot consider the evidence submitted by\nthe defendants--including the juvenile court rulings applicable\nto each named plaintiff--in assessing whether a “real and\nimmediate threat of future injury exists.”  The plaintiffs argue\nthat on a motion to dismiss for lack of standing, the defendants\ncan facially challenge the complaint, but a factual challenge is\nnot permitted if it requires a pretrial determination of the\nmerits of the case.  Filing 88 (Plaintiffs’ Brief--Motion to\nDismiss), p. 32-34.\nThe amended complaint thoroughly discusses past and repeated\nharms experienced by named plaintiffs Carson P., Danielle D.,\n116\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 121 of 199 - Page ID # 2890\nJacob P., Bobbi W., and Hannah A. due to the alleged systemic\ndeficiencies in the child welfare system.  As explained in Park\nv. Forest Service of U.S.,  205 F.3d 1034, 1037 (8th Cir. 2000),\n“[p]ast exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a\npresent case or controversy regarding injunctive relief . . . if\nunaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse effects. . . .” \nPark,  205 F.3d at 1037.  If the alleged unlawful conduct is not\nongoing, the plaintiff does not have standing unless he or she\ndemonstrates the existence of a real and immediate threat of\nsuffering a similar injury in the future.  Park, 205 F.3d at\n1037.  \nI need not resolve the issue of whether the defendants can\nproperly raise a “factual” challenge to the plaintiffs’ standing. \nUnder either a “facial” or “factual” analysis, named plaintiffs\nCarson P., Danielle D., Jacob P., Bobbi W., and Hannah A. have\ndemonstrated a risk of future harm that is sufficiently real and\nimminent to support standing.  The evidence of record does not\ncontradict the allegations of the complaint.  Both the evidence\nand the allegations reflect that these named plaintiffs remain in\nstate custody and have been in state custody for a significant\nperiod of time; they have been moved from one placement to\nanother and have encountered difficulties in those placements;\nand they each seek stable home environments but have yet to be\nplaced in permanent homes.  Under this undisputed factual\nhistory, the fact that their “needs for safety, health and well\nbeing [were] being met,” (filing 72 (Defendants’ Brief–Motion to\nDismiss), p. 54), when the lawsuit was filed does not eliminate\ntheir future risk of ongoing problems within the HHS child\nwelfare system.  As past HHS practice would indicate, they can be\nmoved to another placement; as the plaintiffs’ allegations would\nindicate, they could begin to encounter problems in their current\n117\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 122 of 199 - Page ID # 2891\nplacements and not be promptly moved.  The lawsuit filed does not\nseek to change the named plaintiffs’ current placement.  Rather,\nthe plaintiffs seek an order enjoining HHS from continuing to\nimplement its current policies, because those policies present a\nreal and continuous threat that past harms from HHS’ actions or\ninactions will occur again.\nThe claims of named plaintiffs Carson P., Danielle D., Jacob\nP., Bobbi W., and Hannah A. to enjoin HHS’ current policies and\npractices “may arise again” in the future.  Geraghty, 445 U.S. at\n398.  See e.g. 31 Foster Children, 329 F.3d at 1266 (holding\nfoster children involuntarily in defendants’ custody could not\navoid exposure to the defendants’ alleged systemic deficiencies\nwhich presented a substantial and sufficiently imminent\nlikelihood that past injurious conduct would continue); Carr v.\nWilson-Coker, 203 F.R.D. 66 (D.Conn. 2001)(holding that named\nplaintiffs, who had been denied dental services in the past,\nstill had standing to pursue class claims for lack of access to\ndental services even after they received dental care); Christina\nA., 197 F.R.D. at 670(holding doctrine applied in suit against\ninstitution, where four named plaintiffs were transferred out of\ninstitution, but could be transferred back and again subjected to\nthe conditions, policies and practices at issue in the\nlitigation).  Whether the ongoing risk these plaintiffs face\narises from the HHS’ allegedly deficient practices and policies,\nfrom some other culpable behavior, or through no fault of anyone,\nremains at issue, but it cannot be decided on a motion to dismiss\nfor lack of standing.\n118\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 123 of 199 - Page ID # 2892\niii. Adequacy of Representation:  Carson P., Danielle D.,\nJacob P., Bobbi W., and Hannah A.\n“The adequacy inquiry under Rule 23(a)(4) serves to uncover\nconflicts of interest between named parties and the class they\nseek to represent.”  Amchem, 521 U.S. at 625.  Though the\nplaintiffs’ broad brush allegations tend to blur the differences\namong the putative class members in this case, careful\nconsideration reveals that the priority of relief and remedies\nrequested, and the allocation of HHS resources demanded, by\nputative class members may vary greatly.  Conflicts of interest\nmay well exist between those named plaintiffs who primarily seek\nlong-term permanency planning with adoption, and putative class\nmembers (or even named plaintiffs) who are focusing on access to\nhealth care, resources for reunification, or assistance with a\nwayward child.31  This suit seeks to benefit not only the named\nplaintiffs, but also unnamed and unknown 3(a) and 3(b)\nadjudicated children who are currently or may later enter the\nchild welfare system.  I cannot conclude that the interests of\n3(a) “abused and neglected” juveniles are sufficiently similar to\nthose of 3(a) “dependent” and 3(b) juveniles such that their\nviewpoints and goals are unlikely to diverge.\nEven among 3(a) “abused and neglected” juveniles, the\ninterests and goals of this litigation may differ.  For example,\nwhile some may be seeking an order requiring HHS to implement\npolicies for expeditiously terminating parental rights and\nlocating adoptive homes, other 3(a) “abused and neglected”\njuveniles may want an order requiring the HHS to implement\npolicies and direct its resources toward family rehabilitation\n31See also the “Typicality” section of this report and\nrecommendation. \n119\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 124 of 199 - Page ID # 2893\nwith a goal of reunification.  While these policy goals can co-\nexist, they are at tension--these groups likely agree that in\nmost cases, reunification should be attempted, but they certainly\nmay disagree concerning when HHS should cease reunification\nefforts and re-direct its attention to terminating parental\nrights and, accordingly, what any court order on this issue\nshould require.  \nIn this case, the named plaintiffs allege the following\ncommon question of fact:\nc.  Whether Defendants fail to provide appropriate and\ntimely permanency planning and services for children in\nfoster care to assure that they are properly cared for\nand either safely reunited with their families or freed\nfor adoption and promptly placed in another permanent\nhome, consistent with applicable law and reasonable\nprofessional standards. \n          \nFiling 64 (Amended Complaint), ¶ 38(a).  To the extent the named\nplaintiffs ask this court to order and enforce an HHS policy\nassuring safe reunification or prompt placement in another\npermanent home in accordance the “applicable law and reasonable\nprofessional standards,” it is foreseeable that even 3(a) “abused\nand neglected” juveniles will have divergent viewpoints and goals\nin this litigation.  The plaintiffs have failed to prove they can\nadequately represent, and bind by that representation, the class\nas a whole.\nb. Adequacy of Representation/Lack of Prudential\nStanding--the Next Friends.\nThe defendants further argue that the named plaintiffs’\n“next friends” will not adequately represent the class.  The\ndefendants claim the next friends lack sufficient knowledge\nconcerning the named plaintiffs or their current custodial\n120\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 125 of 199 - Page ID # 2894\nplacement, and while purporting to represent the interests of an\nindividually named plaintiff they are, in reality, merely\nattempting to advance their personal ideological goal of\nreforming Nebraska’s foster care system.  The defendants argue\nthat each named plaintiff has a guardian ad litem familiar with\nhis or her needs, and who was authorized to pursue this action on\na named plaintiff’s behalf had a federal claim been\nappropriate.32  Filing 71, (Defendants’ Brief--Class\nCertification), pp. 51-59; filing 72 (Defendants’ Brief--Motion\nto Dismiss), pp. 43-53.   \nIn the context of challenging the “next friends” as class\nrepresentatives, the question is whether they, like the\nplaintiffs’ counsel, “are able and willing to prosecute the\naction competently and vigorously.”  Elizabeth M.,, 2005 WL\n1206150 at *7.  “Next friends” of class representatives must not\nonly represent the interests of an individually named plaintiff,\nbut must also vigorous prosecute the interests of the class as a\nwhole.  The defendants in this case are not challenging the next\nfriends’ fervor to litigate for class-wide relief; indeed, they\nargue that each next friend is personally motivated to pursue a\nclass-wide claim without regard to representing the actual\ninterests of any specific child, including a named plaintiff.  \n32I recognize that having concluded the named plaintiffs\ncannot adequately represent the proposed class, I need not\naddress whether their “next friends” are appropriate\nrepresentatives.  However, this is a report and recommendation. \nShould Judge Kopf order that the named plaintiffs are appropriate\nclass representatives, the capacity, ability, and standing of the\n“next friends” to represent the named plaintiffs will be\nrelevant.\n121\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 126 of 199 - Page ID # 2895\nRule 17(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides:\nWhenever an infant . . . has a representative, such as\na general guardian, committee, conservator, or other\nlike fiduciary, the representative may sue or defend on\nbehalf of the infant . . . .  An infant . . . who does\nnot have a duly appointed representative may sue by a\nnext friend or by a guardian ad litem.  The court shall\nappoint a guardian ad litem for an infant . . . not\notherwise represented in an action or shall make such\nother order as it deems proper for the protection of\nthe infant . . . .\nFed. R. Civ. P. 17(c).\nThe defendants argue that next friend representation is not\nappropriate in this case because each named plaintiff has a\nguardian ad litem appointed by the juvenile court, and therefore\n“a representative . . . [that] may sue or defend” on his or her\nbehalf.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c).  See filing 72 (Defendants’\nBrief--Motion to Dismiss), pp. 9, 42-45.  When any juvenile is\nbrought before the Nebraska juvenile court, “the court, on its\nown motion or upon application of a party to the proceedings,\nshall appoint a guardian ad litem for the juvenile . . . in any\nproceeding pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (3)(a) of\nsection 43-247.”  Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-272(2)(e)(LEXIS 2005).\nThe named plaintiffs’ court-appointed guardians ad litem are\nnot, however, considered a “general guardians.”  Orr v. Knowles,\n215 Neb. 49, 58, 337 N.W.2d 699, 705 (1983).  “A guardian ad\nlitem . . . is different than a parent or legal guardian, [and]\nonly has the power to act in the single situation for which he or\nshe is appointed.”  Orr, 215 Neb. at 58, 337 N.W.2d at 705.  A\nguardian ad litem has the duty to “protect the interests of the\njuvenile for whom he or she has been appointed guardian, and\nshall be deemed a parent of the juvenile as to those proceedings\n122\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 127 of 199 - Page ID # 2896\nwith respect to which his or her guardianship extends.”  Neb.\nRev. Stat. § 43-272(LEXIS 2005)(emphasis added).  Nebraska law\ndoes not grant guardians ad litem the statutory authority to\nassist in initiating litigation beyond the proceedings for which\nthey were appointed.  In re Interest of Brittany S., 12 Neb. App.\n208, 218-219, 670 N.W.2d 465, 473 (Neb. App. 2003).  \nThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs’ allegations in\nthis forum are related to the juvenile court proceedings, and\ntherefore the named plaintiffs’ guardians ad litem could pursue\nthis federal litigation as an extension of the juvenile court\nproceedings.  This argument impermissibly extends the scope of\nNebraska guardian ad litem authority.33  Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-272\nlimits the guardian ad litem’s role to representing the child in\nthe forum of appointment on matters pending at the time of\nappointment.  The named plaintiffs’ guardians ad litem are not\nauthorized to represent the named plaintiffs in this forum.  \nMoreover, to the extent the guardians ad litem appointed by\nthe juvenile court concurred with HHS’ recommendations during\ninitial and periodic placement proceedings before the juvenile\ncourt, a conflict of interest will arise if those same guardians\n33The defendants cite In re Antonio S., 270 Neb. 792, 795,\n708 N.W.2d 614, 617 (2005) as exemplifying the expansive role of\nthe guardian ad litem in representing the interests of the child. \nSee filing 72 (Defendants’ Brief--Motion to Dismiss), pp. 44-45.\nHowever, in In re Antonio S., the guardian ad litem appealed the\njuvenile court’s order to the Nebraska Supreme Court.  The\nguardian ad litem had been appointed by the juvenile court to\nrepresent the child, and requesting appellate review of that\ncourt’s order was clearly within the realm of that appointment.  \nIn re Antonio S. does not authorize a guardian ad litem\nappointed by the state juvenile court to initiate a separate \nproceeding in federal court challenging HHS practices and\nplacement determinations on federal constitutional and statutory\ngrounds.\n123\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 128 of 199 - Page ID # 2897\nad litem are tasked in this forum with challenging the\ndepartment’s placement and permanency plan recommendations. \nThough a guardian ad litem appointed by the juvenile court “is\ndeemed a parent of the juvenile,” (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-272\n(LEXIS 2005)), the federal court may permit a next friend to\npursue litigation or appoint guardian ad litem “when it appears\nthat the minor's general representative has interests which may\nconflict with those of the person he is supposed to represent.”34\nDevelopmental Disabilities Advocacy Center, Inc. v. Melton, 689\nF.2d 281, 285 (1st Cir. 1982)(holding that advocate for the\ndisabled with no “natural or other official relationship” to\ndisabled person had no standing to sue under rule 17(c)).

A\nreview of the entirety of each the next friend’s deposition\nreveals the defendants did not distort the deposition testimony;\nthere is substantial reason to question whether the plaintiffs’\nnext friends will adequately represent their individual\ninterests.\n“Next friends” usually appear in federal court on behalf of\ndetained prisoners who are unable, usually because of mental\nincompetence or inaccessibility, to seek relief themselves. \nWhitmore v.

As such, they lack capacity to sue.  See Fed. R.\nCiv.

Stat. 25-307(LEXIS 2005)(“[T]he action of an infant shall be\ncommenced, maintained, and prosecuted by his [or her] guardian or\nnext friend.”). \nThe question is whether the “next friends” are truly\ndedicated to pursuing the best interests of the named plaintiffs. \nIn claiming “next friend” status is supported by the evidence of\nrecord, the plaintiffs cite to Ad Hoc Committee of Concerned\nTeachers v. Greenburgh No. 11 Union Free School Dist., 873 F.2d\n25, 30-31 (2d Cir. 1989), a case that pre-dates Whitmore.  Ad Hoc\nCommittee held:\n[A] court should consider the good faith of those\nclaiming to speak for the infant and satisfy itself\nthat the “next friend” is motivated by a sincere desire\nto seek justice on the infant's behalf.  In addition, a\ncourt should explore the ability of the “next friend”--\nfinancial or otherwise--to prosecute the type of action\nat hand.  We would not sanction any attempt to assert\nthe legitimate rights of children as a mere pretext for\nadvancing ulterior political or economic aims.  Nor\nwould we approve of persons who, despite their good\nintentions, find themselves unable to finish what they\nstart.  Since the facts and circumstances of each case\nwill vary, a court should conduct an inquiry into the\napplication of any adult or group of adults seeking to\nrepresent a child's interests as “next friend.”\n. . .\nThe term [“next friend”] is broad enough to include\nanyone who has an interest in the welfare of an infant\n128\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 133 of 199 - Page ID # 2902\nwho may have a grievance or a cause of action . . . \nThe right of access to courts by those who feel they\nare aggrieved should not be curtailed; and this is\nparticularly so in the instance of children who,\nrightly or wrongly, attribute such grievances to their\nvery custodians.

Brophy, 124 F.3d 893 (7th Cir. 1997), the\nSeventh Circuit held that a child abuse prevention advocate could\nnot bring an action as the next friend of children who were\nallegedly removed from the home of their white foster parents and\nplaced in the home of a black (and sexually abusive) aunt on the\nbasis of race.  The self-appointed “next friend” was described as\n“a professional children’s advocate who, having interested\nhimself in the [case] at the behest of the lawyer appearing for\n129\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 134 of 199 - Page ID # 2903\nthe plaintiffs in this suit and having been persuaded or\npersuaded himself that they are being ill-used by their aunt, by\ntheir guardian ad litem, and by the entire Wisconsin\nchild-welfare establishment and judiciary, seeks to represent\nthem so that they can bring this suit.”  T.W., 124 F.3d at 896. \nIn concluding this “next friend” could not represent the\nplaintiffs’ interests, the court reasoned:  \nBearing in mind the considerations that we have\ndiscussed, and the almost complete lack of authority on\nthe question, we think the proper rule is that the next\nfriend must be an appropriate alter ego for a plaintiff\nwho is not able to litigate in his own right; that\nordinarily the eligibles will be confined to the\nplaintiff's parents, older siblings (if there are no\nparents), or a conservator or other guardian, akin to a\ntrustee; that persons having only an ideological stake\nin the child's case are never eligible; but that if a\nclose relative is unavailable and the child has no\nconflict-free general representative the court may\nappoint a personal friend of the plaintiff or his\nfamily, a professional who has worked with the child,\nor, in desperate circumstances, a stranger whom the\ncourt finds to be especially suitable to represent the\nchild's interests in the litigation. . . .  Without\nsuch a rule, and specifically its exclusion of purely\nideological “friends,” we may find [this next friend]\npopping up in children's suits all over the circuit,\nperhaps all over the country.\nT.W., 124 F.3d at 897 (Posner, J.)(internal citations omitted).\nThe self-appointed next friends in this case are not family\nmembers, conservators, or other guardians of the named\nplaintiffs.

Bobbi W., and Hannah A. agreed to represent a\nnamed plaintiff at the request of plaintiffs’ counsel.  As to\nReverend Jensen and Ms. Creager, there is no evidence they knew\nprecisely who they would be assigned to represent before agreeing\nto be a “next friend.”  Ms. Foreman is appearing at the request\nof Doug Gray, an attorney for Children’s Rights, (filing 74\n(Supplemental Evidence Index), ex. 31 (Foreman Deposition), pp.\n31-32, 35, 55); Reverend Jensen was contacted by Marnie Jensen,\nan attorney at the Ogborn, Summerlin & Ogborn law firm, (filing\n74 (Supplemental Evidence Index), ex. 35 (Jensen Deposition),\n10); after initially agreeing to be a next friend at the request\nof Citizen Advocacy, Ms. Creager was contacted by Marnie Jensen,\n(filing 74 (Supplemental Evidence Index), ex. 46 (Creager\nDeposition), 34-36); and Ms. Nkwocha was contacted by Jennifer\nCarter of Nebraska Appleseed, (filing 74 (Supplemental Evidence\nIndex), ex. 47 (Nkwocha Deposition), 34-35).  \nWith the exception of Ms. Foreman, (filing 74 (Supplemental\nEvidence Index), ex. 31 (Foreman Deposition), pp. 31-32), each\nnext friend has at least a basic understanding of the\nresponsibilities of a next friend for a class representative. \nSee filing 74 (Supplemental Evidence Index), ex. 33 (Bruns\nDeposition), 64; filing 74 (Supplemental Evidence Index), ex. 35\n(Jensen Deposition), 27; filing 74 (Supplemental Evidence Index),\nex. 46 (Creager Deposition), 48-49; filing 74 (Supplemental\nEvidence Index), ex. 47 (Nkwocha Deposition), 34-35, 77. \nThe evidence supports a finding that each of these next\nfriends have “an ideological stake” in the named plaintiffs’\ncase; their primary objective appears to be changing Nebraska’s\nchild welfare system.  This is especially true with Reverend\n133\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 138 of 199 - Page ID # 2907\nJensen and Ms. Creager, neither of whom had met their assigned\nnamed plaintiff before agreeing to be a next friend. \nThere is also reason to question the “good faith”\nmotivation, initiative, fortitude, and dedication of these next\nfriends to represent the named plaintiffs’ interests.  The record\nreflects that the next friends expended little, if any, effort to\nseek out sources and discover the current circumstances or the\npotential risk of harm faced by their assigned named plaintiff. \nThey filed a complaint on behalf of the child without this\nknowledge; and as of the time their depositions were taken (at\nleast three months after this suit was filed), they still lacked\nthe information necessary to assess the state’s current efforts\non behalf of the child, and had little, if any, reliable\ninformation concerning the circumstances and suitability of the\nchild’s current placement.  Whatever concerns they did have were\nnot voiced to the juvenile court, guardians ad litem, county\nattorneys, HHS caseworkers, or the Foster Care Review Board.37 \nThe evidence currently before me indicates that while each next\nfriend may have sincere empathy for her named plaintiff’s plight,\nher goal in this litigation is system change on behalf of others\nand not advocating the individual interests of her named\nplaintiff. \nI have previously concluded that with respect to named\nplaintiffs Carson P., Danielle D., Jacob P., Bobbi W., and Hannah\n37While there is some evidence that foster parents were\ninstructed not to speak to the next friends, (filing 83\n(supplemental evidence index), ex. 10 (Carter affidavit)), that\ndoes not explain the next friends’ failure to pursue any recent \ninvestigation before apparently deciding litigation would serve\nthe named plaintiffs’ best interests, nor their failure to raise\nconcerns before state agencies and authorities who could assist\nthe child.  \n134\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 139 of 199 - Page ID # 2908\nA., the amended complaint alleges a case or controversy and\nshould not be dismissed for lack of standing.  Assuming this case\nis not otherwise dismissed or the court does not abstain under\nYounger or Rooker-Feldman, these named plaintiffs need “next\nfriend” representation in this forum because they lack capacity\nto sue.  I am not currently convinced that their self-appointed\nnext friends will appropriately represent their individual\ninterests.  The next friends have failed to prove they should\ncontinue to represent a named plaintiff’s interests in this\nforum.38 \nThe defendants advocate that since the next friends who\nfiled this suit are not suitable representatives, dismissal for\nlack of standing is required.  In the context of habeas\nlitigation, the law supports the defendants’ argument.  Whitmore,\n495 U.S. at 165 (holding no case or controversy existed where a\nself-appointed next friend challenged a death sentence, but the\ncapital defendant was mentally competent and able to represent\nhis own interests and chose not to pursue habeas relief);\nCoalition of Clergy, Lawyers, and Professors v. Bush, 310 F.3d\n1153, 1162 (9th Cir. 2002)(dismissing habeas action where the\nplaintiff coalition had no relationship with detainees at Camp X-\nRay and therefore could not serve as their next friends).\nBut the issue is much more difficult when applied to foster\nchildren.  Foster children likely have no “significant\nrelationship” with any adult who can or will litigate on their\n38If their primary motivation for agreeing to be a next\nfriend was, as it would appear, to obtain child welfare system\nreform, I also question whether they will remain interested in\nthis lawsuit at all if the court ultimately concludes the\nproposed class should not be certified.\n135\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 140 of 199 - Page ID # 2909\nbehalf.39  Parents, adult family members, close adult friends,\nand general guardians often do not exist, are unmotivated to\nhelp, are irresponsible, or have a personal interest in the\noutcome.  Where child welfare reform is the issue, caseworkers\nhave a conflict of interest, and foster parents and HHS-\ncompensated service providers (e.g. therapists) likely have a\nconflict of interest.  Nebraska court-appointed guardians ad\nlitem are not only unauthorized by the state court to pursue\nfederal proceedings on a child’s behalf, but may have a conflict\nof interest.  \nUltimately, a foster child’s access to this forum may rest\nwith private citizens who are ideologically motivated to\nrepresent such children, irrespective of whether they know the\nindividual child they agree to represent.  Where such\ncircumstances exist, child advocates can be suitable next friends\nfor a child litigant provided they convince the court that they\nare not solely motivated by ideological goals, (T.W., 124 F.3d at\n897 (“persons having only an ideological stake in the child's\ncase are never eligible”); that the individual child’s best\n39However, “the contours of the requisite ‘significant\nrelationship’ do not remain static, but must necessarily adapt to\nthe circumstances facing each individual . . .  ‘Significance’ is\na relative concept, dependent on the individual [person’s]\nplight.  Not all [persons] have a relative [or] friend able or\nwilling to act on their behalf.  In such an extreme case it is\nplausible that a person with ‘some’ relationship conveying some\nmodicum of authority or consent, ‘significant’ in comparison to\nthe [person’s] other relationships, could serve as the next\nfriend.  Moreover, the concept of ‘true dedication’ is a\nsubjective one, difficult of measurement.  The existence of some\nrelationship, whether it be from authorized representation to\nfriendship or alliance to familial, serves as an objective basis\nfor discerning the ‘intruder’ or ‘uninvited meddler’ from the\ntrue ‘next friend.’”  Coalition of Clergy, Lawyers, and\nProfessors v. Bush, 310 F.3d 1153, 1162 (9th Cir. 2002).\n136\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 141 of 199 - Page ID # 2910\ninterests have been thoroughly considered, and that those\ninterests will remain paramount throughout the litigation.40  See\ne.g. Bowen v. Rubin, 213 F. Supp. 2d 220, 226 (E.D.N.Y.\n2001)(holding that attorneys who were willing to be guardians ad\nlitem for mentally disabled adults on a pro bono basis were not\n“unwanted meddlers” where plaintiffs’ counsel requested the\nassistance, the proposed guardians met and spoke with the\nplaintiffs, and being attorneys, the proposed guardians ad litem\nunderstood their fiduciary obligations to the plaintiffs and\ntheir roles as officers of the court).  \nWhere a self-appointed next friend has filed suit on behalf\nof a foster child, is successfully challenged as lacking\nauthority to act on behalf of that child, and no other\nalternative exists, the court is authorized to appoint “a\nstranger whom the court finds to be especially suitable to\nrepresent the child’s interests in the litigation.”  T.W., 124\nF.3d at 897.  Such a procedure assures the court that a child’s\nability to assert legitimate claims in this forum is not\nsummarily denied because an unsuitable next friend filed the\nlawsuit, while safeguarding the child from being named a\nplaintiff in litigation that is not being pursued with his or\nbest interest in mind.  \n40Assuming the child is represented by a suitable “next\nfriend,” either through self-appointment or court-appointment,\nthe court must remain watchful for “any attempt to assert the\nlegitimate rights of children as a mere pretext for advancing\nulterior political or economic gains.”  Ad Hoc Comm., 873 F.2d at\n31.  “[H]owever worthy and high minded the motives of ‘next\nfriends’ may be, they inevitably run the risk of making the\nactual [plaintiff] a pawn to be manipulated on a chessboard\nlarger than his [or her] own case.”  Lenhard v. Wolff, 443 U.S.\n1306, 1312 (1979).\n137\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 142 of 199 - Page ID # 2911\nAlthough the defendants may argue that such a procedure is\nnot supported by the holding in Whitmore, there is a discernable\ndifference between filing a next friend habeas suit on behalf of\na prisoner, and filing a next friend civil suit on behalf of a\nfoster child.  A prisoner who is competent can decide for himself\nif the suit should be filed, and a next friend who presumes to\nmake that decision for him is an “intruder” or “uninvited\nmeddler,” but a child is in no position to understand and\nchallenge a next friend’s status or whether the suit filed is in\nhis or her best interest.  Moreover, an incompetent prisoner who\ncannot make rational decisions often has a family member, close\nfriend, general guardian, or attorney who can serve as a next\nfriend, and the mere existence of this relationship creates some\nindicia that the prisoner’s best interests were considered before\nfiling the suit; for a foster child, there is often no other\nadult who has a “significant relationship” with the child.  In\nsuch cases, challenging the suit on the basis of the next\nfriend’s lack of standing is left to the defendant and/or the\ncourt.  The defendant may move for immediate dismissal for lack\nof standing based on the next friend’s unsuitability, but the\ncourt’s ultimate responsibility is providing access to the courts\nand justice.  \nUntil an appropriate next friend is appointed to represent a\nchild litigant, and absent a valid challenge to the face of the\ncomplaint itself, the court lacks any reliable basis for\ndetermining if the claims purportedly raised on the child’s\nbehalf present a justiciable controversy or should be asserted in\nthe child’s interests.  If the allegations of a foster child’s\ncomplaint, considered true, may present a cognizable claim within\nthis court’s jurisdiction, the court should appoint a suitable\nrepresentative for the child before addressing whether the case\n138\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 143 of 199 - Page ID # 2912\nshould be dismissed.  T.W., 124 F.3d at 898 (noting that but for\ndismissal on the basis of Rooker-Feldman abstention, child\nadvocate would be afforded a chance to seek court appointment as\nthe child’s next friend before the suit was dismissed on the\nbasis of lack of capacity to sue).  An appropriately appointed\n“next friend,” who understands the responsibilities of the\nposition and has evaluated the child’s interests, may decide on\nthe child’s behalf to either dismiss the suit or continue to\nlitigate.  If the latter is chosen, the defendant may still\nrespond that dismissal is appropriate because no case or\ncontroversy exists. \nAccordingly, should the court determine that the named\nplaintiffs’ amended complaint alleges a potentially cognizable\nclaim, and that abstention is not required, next friends should\nbe appointed to represent these named plaintiffs.  The named\nplaintiffs’ self-appointed next friends, Ms. Foreman, Ms. Bruns,\nReverend Jensen, Ms. Creager, and Ms. Nkwocha, may move to be\nappointed, and may be appointed upon a showing, made in an\nevidentiary hearing, that they meet the standards for appointment\nas next friends as set forth in this report and recommendation. \nThe defendants’ motion to dismiss based on the next friends’ lack\nof standing, and therefore the named plaintiffs’ lack of capacity\nto sue, should be held in abeyance.\nII.

As to their request for Younger abstention, they\nclaim that federal injunctive relief would interfere with the\nongoing judicial oversight provided by the Nebraska juvenile\ncourt system, juvenile proceedings are a matter of important\nstate interest, and any federal claims raised in this case could\nbe raised in the juvenile court forum.  As to the request for\nRooker-Feldman abstention, the defendants claim any federal court\nrelief entered in this case could effectively reverse prior state\ncourt determinations regarding juvenile placement and care. \nA. The Rooker-Feldman Doctrine.\nUnder the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, except in habeas cases, \nlower federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over\nchallenges to state court judgments.  Ballinger v. Culotta, 322\nF.3d 546, 548 (8th Cir. 2003).  “The doctrine bars federal courts\nfrom hearing cases brought by the losing parties in state court\nproceedings alleging ‘injury caused by the state-court judgment\nand seeking review and rejection of that judgment.’”  Mosby v.\nLigon, 418 F.3d 927, 931 (8th Cir. 2005)(quoting Exxon Mobil\nCorp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1526 (2005)).\nDistrict courts may not review state court decisions,\n“even if those challenges allege that the state court’s\naction was unconstitutional,” Feldman, 460 U.S. at 486,\n103 S.Ct. 1303, because “[f]ederal jurisdiction to\nreview most state court judgments is vested exclusively\nin the United States Supreme Court,” Lemonds, 222 F.3d\nat 492 (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1257; Feldman, 460 U.S. at\n486, 103 S.Ct. 1303).  A party who was unsuccessful in\nstate court thus “is barred from seeking what in\nsubstance would be appellate review of the state\njudgment in a United States district court based on the\nlosing party’s claim that the state judgment itself\nviolates the loser's federal rights.”  Johnson v. De\nGrandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1005-1006 (1994) (citing Feldman,\n460 U.S. at 482; Rooker, 263 U.S. at 416.  This\n140\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 145 of 199 - Page ID # 2914\njurisdictional bar extends not only to “straightforward\nappeals but also [to] more indirect attempts by federal\nplaintiffs to undermine state court decisions.” \nLemonds, 222 F.3d at 492. Federal district courts thus\nmay not “exercis[e] jurisdiction over general\nconstitutional claims that are ‘inextricably\nintertwined’ with specific claims already adjudicated\nin state court.”  Id. at 492-93.\nBallinger, 322 F.3d at 548-49.  \nBallinger held that under Rooker-Feldman, the court lacked\nsubject matter jurisdiction over a father’s § 1983 action\nalleging the state child support services and his child’s\nmaternal grandfather violated his constitutionally protected\nrights of parental association, due process, and equal protection\nby awarding child custody to stemming from state court's award of\nchild custody to the grandfather.  The court reasoned that since\nthe father could prevail on his federal claims only if the\ndistrict court determined that the state court judge wrongly\ndecided the legal questions at issue, the relief requested in the\n§ 1983 action would effectively reverse the state court decision\nor void its ruling.  Accordingly, the federal court action was\neffectively a prohibited attempt to appeal the state-court\njudgment, and the Rooker-Feldman doctrine barred the district\ncourt from considering the father’s claims.\nUnlike the state court judgment in Barringer, the\nplaintiffs’ complaint does not seek reversal of any prior\njuvenile court rulings, but asks for prospective relief. \nJuvenile court rulings remain subject to future modification and\nreview so long as the child remains in HHS legal custody.  The\nplaintiffs’ requested injunction seeks HHS policy changes that\nmay affect the outcome of future juvenile court review\nproceedings, but this requested relief will not effectively\n141\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 146 of 199 - Page ID # 2915\nreverse past rulings.  Since this court could enter prospective\nrelief in favor of the plaintiffs without addressing the merits\nand reasoning of past juvenile court rulings, the plaintiffs’ §\n1983 claim does not represent an attempt to appeal a state court\njudgment by filing federal court litigation.  The Rooker-Feldman\ndoctrine does not apply to this case.\nB. Younger Abstention.\nUnlike Rooker-Feldman abstention, Younger abstention goes to\nthe exercise of equity jurisdiction, not to the federal court’s\njurisdiction of the to hear the case.  Younger abstention “does\nnot arise from lack of jurisdiction in the District Court, but\nfrom strong policies counseling against the exercise of such\njurisdiction where particular kinds of state proceedings have\nalready been commenced.”  Ohio Civil Rights Com'n v. Dayton\nChristian Schools, Inc., 477 U.S. 619, 626 (1986). \nYounger abstention applies to federal claims for declaratory\nrelief and injunctive relief.  The motivating force behind\nYounger abstention is the promotion of comity between state and\nfederal judicial bodies.  Aaron v. Target Corp., 357 F.3d 768,\n774 (8th Cir. 2004).  Under Younger, a federal court should\nabstain from exercising jurisdiction in cases where equitable\nrelief would interfere with pending state proceedings in a way\nthat offends principles of comity and federalism.  Aaron, 357\nF.3d at 774.  Accordingly, abstention under Younger is\nappropriate where: (1) there are ongoing state judicial\nproceedings; (2) those state proceedings implicate important\nstate interests; (3) the federal litigation will interfere with\nthe state proceedings; and (4) the state proceedings provided the\nfederal plaintiff with an adequate opportunity to raise the\n142\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 147 of 199 - Page ID # 2916\nfederal claims.  Norwood v. Dickey, 409 F.3d 901, 903 (8th Cir.\n2005)(citing Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar\nAss'n, 457 U.S. 423, 431-32 (1982).  \nFor the reasons discussed hereafter, I conclude the court\nshould abstain under Younger from exercising jurisdiction over\nthe plaintiffs’ claims.\n1. Ongoing State Proceedings.\nEach of the plaintiffs, and every child adjudicated under\nNeb. Rev. Stat. 3(a) or 3(b) and in HHS legal custody, is subject\nto the continuing jurisdiction of the Nebraska juvenile court\nsystem.  Following adjudication, the court conducts a \ndisposition hearing to determine the child’s placement and the\nrights of the parties in the action.  In re Interest of Joshua\nM., 256 Neb. 596, 591 N.W.2d 557 (1999).  The court must\ndetermine where the child will be placed and must review this\ndispositional order for each child at least once every six months\nto reaffirm the order or direct another disposition of the child. \nNeb. Rev. Stat. § 43-1313.  As such, the named plaintiffs, and\nall members of the putative class, are subject to ongoing state\nproceedings before the Nebraska juvenile court system.  31 Foster\nChildren, 329 F.3d at 1277 (holding that state proceedings were\nongoing where the state court holds an initial adjudicatory\nhearing regarding a potential foster child, “retains continuing\njurisdiction over a dependency case and reviews the child’s\nstatus at least every six months,” must approve the case plan,\nand may amend the plan); J.B., 186 F.3d at 1291 (“We hold that\nthe continuing jurisdiction of the Children's Court to modify a\nchild's disposition, . . . coupled with the mandatory six-month\nperiodic review hearings, . . . constitutes an ongoing state\n143\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 148 of 199 - Page ID # 2917\njudicial proceeding.”); Laurie Q. v. Contra Costa County, 304 F.\nSupp. 2d 1185, 1204 (N.D.Cal. 2004)(“[T]he substantial oversight\nrole that the Juvenile Court must play during the pendency of a\nchild’s care within the foster system is sufficient to create an\nongoing judicial proceeding for the purposes of Younger.”);\nOlivia Y. ex rel. Johnson v. Barbour, 351 F. Supp. 2d 543, 567-68\n(S.D. Miss. 2004)(“In view of the continuing nature of the duties\nand responsibilities statutorily imposed upon the state’s youth\ncourts, . . . [the] proceedings may fairly be said to be\n“ongoing” in the case of each child over whom the youth courts\nhave assumed jurisdiction.”).\n2. State Proceedings Implicate Important State Interests.\n“Family relations are a traditional area of state concern.”  \nMoore v. Sims, 442 U.S. 415, 435 (1979).  The state has a\ncompelling interest in quickly and effectively removing the\nvictims of child abuse and neglect from their parents and placing\nthem in safe and suitable homes.  State conduct performed and\nproceedings instituted to protect children from abuse implicate\nsufficiently important state interests to justify Younger\nabstention.  Moore, 442 U.S. at 435 (applying Younger abstention\nto case challenging the state’s temporary removal of a child from\nan allegedly abusive home environment).\nNebraska’s interest in this issue is evidenced by its\ncurrent and ongoing welfare reform efforts.  The state’s Foster\nCare Review Board 2004 report includes extensive recommendations\nfor restructuring the state’s child welfare delivery system,\ncreating expedited review processes to afford quicker permanent\nplacements, using state and federal funds more effectively, and\n144\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 149 of 199 - Page ID # 2918\nholding perpetrators of abuse accountable.  Filing 73, ex. 14\n(Foster Care Rev. Bd. 2004 Annual Report), p. HHS-010980-91.  \nThe Chief Justice of the Nebraska Supreme Court formed the\nSupreme Court Commission on Children in the Courts in 2005, and\nthat committee continues state-wide efforts to address many of\nthe issues raised by the plaintiffs in this case.  The State is\nalso participating in collaborative national and multi-state\nefforts to develop welfare reform plans for implementation at\nstate and local levels.  Filing 73, ex. 37 (Montanez Affidavit),\n¶¶ 12-14.41\n41Though the defendants argue that Younger abstention is\nmandatory, Warmus v. Melahn, 62 F.3d 252, 255 (8th Cir. 1995),\nrev’d on other grounds, 517 U.S. 1241 (1996), held that “when a\nfederal action is projected to unduly interfere with ongoing\nstate proceedings ‘so important that exercise of federal judicial\npower would disregard the comity between the states and federal\ngovernment,’ federal courts have the discretion to abstain.” \nWarmus, 62 F.3d at 255 (citing Pennzoil v. Texaco, Inc., 481 U.S.\n1, 11 (1987), and Yamaha Motor Corp. v. Riney, 21 F.3d 793, 798\n(8th Cir. 1994)(district court's decision to abstain under\nYounger reviewed for an abuse of discretion).  See also\nQuackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706, 718-719\n(1996)(“[I]t has long been established that a federal court has\nthe authority to decline to exercise its jurisdiction when it is\nasked to employ its historic powers as a court of equity.”);\nAddiction Specialists, Inc. v. Township of Hampton, 411 F.3d 399\n(3d Cir. 2005)(“A federal district court has discretion to\nabstain from exercising jurisdiction over a particular claim\nwhere resolution of that claim in federal court would offend\nprinciples of comity by interfering with an ongoing state\nproceeding.”).  But see Canatella v. California, 404 F.3d 1106,\n1113 (9th Cir. 2005)(“District courts applying Younger must\nexercise jurisdiction except when specific legal standards are\nmet, and may not exercise jurisdiction when those standards are\nmet; there is no discretion vested in the district courts to do\notherwise.”).  To the extent that Younger abstention is\ndiscretionary, the efforts already underway, and especially the\nefforts of the Supreme Court’s Commission on Children in the\nCourts, should be considered.  Litigating claims in federal\ncourt, with evidence presented through adversarial and competing\nexpert testimony, is no substitute for the contemplative and\nreasoned analysis of the State’s judiciary and the committee\nmembers it has entrusted with tackling this difficult problem.\n145\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 150 of 199 - Page ID # 2919\n3. The Federal Litigation Will Interfere with the State\nProceeding.\nThe plaintiffs have not requested any specific type of\ninjunctive relief.  The prayer for relief in their complaint\nessentially requests the court to enter an order requiring the\ndefendants to cease violating the plaintiffs’ constitutional\nrights and comply with federal statutory requirements.  Under\ncircumstances such as this, some courts have refused to abstain\nunder Younger because, absent a specific request for injunctive\nrelief, they could not conclude that a federal order would\nnecessarily interfere with ongoing state proceedings.  See Olivia\nY., 351 F. Supp. 2d at 570; Kenny A., 218 F.R.D. at 286 n. 5.  As\nexplained in Olivia Y.:\n[T]he question presented under . . . the Younger\ninquiry is not simply whether there are ongoing state\njudicial proceedings, but whether the federal\nproceeding at issue will interfere with such state\nproceedings.  Unfortunately, owing to the generality of\nplaintiffs' prayer for relief in the case at bar, that\ndetermination is not as readily made as it might\notherwise have been.  Although plaintiffs’ complaint\nchallenges defendants’ actions and inaction in numerous\nareas, their request for relief is quite general.  They\nbroadly request that this court “[d]eclare\nunconstitutional [/or] and unlawful ...” defendants’\nviolation of their rights under the due process clause,\nequal protection clause, the AACWA and Mississippi Code\nAnnotated § 43-21-609(b) and (c)(ii), that the court\n“[p]ermanently enjoin defendants from subjecting\nmembers of the Plaintiff class to practices that\nviolate their rights,” and “[o]rder appropriate\nremedial relief to ensure that a detailed plan is\ndeveloped, implemented, and monitored to ensure\nDefendants protect the legal rights of Plaintiffs as\nset forth in this complaint.”\n. . . .\n146\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 151 of 199 - Page ID # 2920\nThis court does recognize that the interference at\nwhich Younger is aimed need not be direct, but rather\nmay be indirect interference. . . .  In the case at\nbar, the court still would be hard-pressed to conclude\nthat any specific relief plaintiffs seek in this action\nwould necessarily interfere with ongoing youth court\nproceedings.  Or stated another way, it is not apparent\nall\nthat   the relief plaintiffs might request would\ninterfere, either directly or indirectly, with ongoing\nyouth court proceedings.  Accordingly, the court will\ndeny defendants' request for Younger abstention.\nOlivia Y., 351 F. Supp. 2d at 570 (emphasis in original).\nI conclude, however, that the plaintiffs’ artful pleading\nand lack of specificity should not serve to circumvent the\nprinciples of comity protected by Younger abstention; that is,\nthe plaintiffs’ failure to identify the specific relief requested\nshould not assist them in defeating defendants’ motion to dismiss\non the basis of Younger abstention.  Therefore, rather than\nrelying on the plaintiffs’ prayer for relief to determine what\ninjunctive remedy the plaintiffs may request, the court will rely\non the allegations of the amended complaint, the presumption\nbeing that the plaintiffs will ultimately request an order\nremedying each allegedly wrongful action or inaction performed by\nHHS.\nBased on the specific allegations of the amended complaint,\nit appears the plaintiffs will request an injunction requiring\nthe State to:42\n-- Change its policies applicable to locating, re-\nlocating, and selecting placements for children; specifically,\n42See also filing 42 (Report of Parties’ Planning\nConference), pp. 5-11, summarized in this report and\nrecommendation at pages 2-4.\n147\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 152 of 199 - Page ID # 2921\n• Move children less frequently and to more appropriate\nplacements, (filing 64 (Amended Complaint), ¶¶ 4(a),\n114, 110-111);\n• Provide transitional support to children moving from\none placement to another, (filing 64 (Amended\nComplaint), ¶¶ 115–16);\n• Limit the placement time spent in emergency shelters\nand other temporary facilities, (filing 64 (Amended\nComplaint), ¶ 4(b)); \n• Eliminate or sparingly use emergency shelters and other\ntemporary facilities for placement of small children,\n(filing 64 (Amended Complaint), ¶ 4(c)); \n• Limit the number of children placed in a particular\nfoster home, (filing 64 (Amended Complaint), ¶ 4(d));\n• Screen foster homes, (filing 64 (Amended Complaint), ¶¶\n4(e), 129);  \n• Limit the use of institutional placements for children,\n(filing 64 (Amended Complaint), ¶ 4(f)); \n• Use institutional placements and therapeutic foster\nhomes when warranted, (filing 64 (Amended Complaint), ¶\n113, 118);\n   \n• Segregate dangerous or sexually reactive children from\nother foster children.

This determination, in turn, depends\non the extent to which Nebraska juvenile court judges are already\nvested with oversight responsibility and authority to consider\n149\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 154 of 199 - Page ID # 2923\nthe impact of the foregoing complaints with respect to each child\nand enter orders for the benefit of such children under their\njurisdiction.  \nNebraska law provides:\n[T]he Nebraska Juvenile Code . . . must be liberally\nconstrued to accomplish its purpose of serving the best\ninterests of the juveniles who fall within it.  The\njuvenile court has broad discretion as to the\ndisposition of those who fall within its jurisdiction.\n. . .  The basis for such power is the power of the\nState.  The State’s jurisdiction arises out of the\npower that every sovereignty possesses as parens\npatriae to every child within its borders to determine\nthe status and custody that will best meet its needs\nand wants.\nThe juvenile court is a product of the solicitude\nof the law for the welfare of infants.  Its powers and\nduties are described more or less in detail in our\nstatutes, and because of their humanitarian and\nbenefi[cial] purpose, they should be liberally\nconstrued to the end that their manifest purpose may be\neffectuated to the fullest extent compatible with their\nterms.\nIn re Interest of R.A., 225 Neb. 157, 168, 403 N.W.2d 357, 365\n(1987)(quoting In re McCauley, 178 Neb. 412, 415, 133 N.W.2d 921,\n924 (1965)(internal citations and quotation marks omitted).  \n[T]he foremost purpose and objective of the juvenile\ncode is the protection of a juvenile’s best interests,\nwith preservation of the juvenile’s familial\nrelationship with his or her parents where the\ncontinuation of such parental relationship is proper\nunder the law. . . .  Thus, the goal of juvenile\nproceedings is not to punish parents, but to protect\nchildren and promote their best interests. \n. . .\n150\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 155 of 199 - Page ID # 2924\nThe potential consequences of child protection\nproceedings range from an order requiring supervision\nof the child by a child protection agency, to leaving\nthe child in the custody of the parents, to an order\nfor the temporary or permanent removal of the child. \nIn re Corey P., 269 Neb. 925, 934, 697 N.W.2d 647, 655 (2005).\nConsistent with their expansive scope of authority, juvenile\ncourt judges decide the appropriate placement for children in HHS\ncustody.  Nebraska statutory law requires HHS Protective Service\nWorkers to prepare a court report and written case plan tailored\nto the child’s individual needs and provide the report to the\njuvenile court and all other interested parties prior to any\nplacement hearing or review hearing, (Neb. Rev. Stat. §\n43-1311(1)).43   The regulations further require the caseworker\nto attend the court hearing and provide testimony as requested or\noral recommendations as necessary.  However, the juvenile court\ndetermines whether the HHS placement recommendations should be\nadopted.  Interest of Crystal T., 7 Neb. App. 921, 925, 586\nN.W.2d 479, 482 (Neb. App. 1998).

See e.g. In re Sarah T., 2006 WL 1736280, *1 (Neb.\nApp. 2006).\nThe juvenile court can order the degree of HHS supervision\nto be afforded a child in HHS legal custody, the number of visits\nto be made, the types of reports to be provided, and the\nrequisite level of training and experience for an HHS caseworker \nassigned to a particular child’s case.  In re Crystal T., supra.,\nIn re Veronica H., 14 Neb. App. 316, 707 N.W.2d 29 (2005).  In In\nre Crystal T., the Nebraska Court of Appeals denied an HHS appeal\nand held that the juvenile court could modify an HHS recommended\ncase plan and order HHS to make 10 to 12 unannounced visits to\nthe home of the juvenile’s mother between hours of 9:00 p.m. and\n6:00 a.m. to ensure that the child was safe and the court’s\ncustodial orders were being followed.  Under the liberal\nauthority granted to the juvenile court, a juvenile court judge\nmay enter orders requiring HHS to remove a child’s case manager\nand reassign the case to a trained and experienced caseworker. \nIn re Veronica H., 14 Neb. App. 316, 707 N.W.2d 29 (2005). \n“[T]he court, having determined the current team of caseworkers\nhad not fulfilled its statutory obligation to report, simply\nordered the removal and reassignment of an alternative team.”  In\nre Veronica H., 14 Neb. App. at 324-25, 707 N.W.2d at 35-36.  In\naffirming this ruling and denying HHS’ appeal, the Nebraska Court\nof Appeals held:\n[T]hrough § 43-285(1), the Legislature gave juvenile\ncourts the power to assent and dissent from the\nplacement and other decisions of DHHS, as well as of\nother entities to whom the court might commit the care\nof a minor, and that the Legislature intended to remove\n154\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 159 of 199 - Page ID # 2928\nDHHS’ complete control of a minor whose care is given\nto DHHS under the Nebraska Juvenile Code.  Thus, we\nconclude that the Legislature, when it elected to add\nthe phrase “by and with the assent of the court” to §\n43-285(1), did in fact give juvenile courts the\nauthority to issue orders such as that issued in the\ninstant case.\nIn re Veronica H., 14 Neb.App. at 324, 707 N.W.2d at 35.\nThe juvenile court decides whether a child should be\nseparated from his or her parents for protection, where the child\nshould be placed, whether efforts to reunify should be attempted,\nthe conditions and supervision required for such attempts, when\nand if parental rights should be terminated, whether the parents\nshould be afforded an opportunity to complete a rehabilitation\nplan before such rights are terminated, and when or if a child\nshould be released from HHS custody (other than by reaching\nadulthood).  All such orders are subject to appellate review by\nthe Nebraska Court of Appeals and the Nebraska Supreme Court. \nSee e.g. In re Eden K., 14 Neb. App. 867, 881-82 (2006)(reversing\ntermination of parental rights where mother was making progress\ntoward reunification); In re Corey P., 269 Neb. at 929, 697\nN.W.2d at 651 (holding the Fourth Amendment was not violated by\nwarrantless entries into the parental home by HHS personnel to\ndetermine compliance with court-imposed conditions for retaining\nphysical custody of the children); In re Shelby L., 270 Neb. 150,\n699 N.W.2d 392 (2005)(reversing juvenile court and Nebraska Court\nof Appeals determination that mother’s parental rights should be\nterminated); In Interest of Boyles, 204 Neb. 546, 553-554, 283\nN.W.2d 382, 387 (1979)(affirming termination of parental rights\nand holding the court correctly concluded that rehabilitative\nefforts would have served no useful purpose).\n155\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 160 of 199 - Page ID # 2929\nBased on the foregoing analysis, I conclude that injunctive \norders by this court which attempt to impose parameters on HHS\nfor determining where a child should be placed; if and how often\na child should be moved to another placement; the child’s length\nof stay in HHS custody; the methods employed and attention given\nto parental rights termination proceedings; the supervision of\nthe children while in HHS custody; the level of training,\nexperience, and workload capability of HHS caseworkers assigned\nto a child; the level of reporting provided to the court by HHS;\nthe rights to visitation with family or former foster families;\nand the types of medical, dental, mental health, and behavioral\ntreatment a child may need, would both directly and indirectly\ninterfere with the plenary jurisdictional and decision-making\nauthority of the Nebraska juvenile courts.  The injunctive relief\nordered would give the federal district court an oversight role\nover Nebraska’s child welfare program, and would give it direct\ncontrol over decisions currently vested in the juvenile court. \nJ.B., 186 F.3d at 1292.\nIn this case, the plaintiffs are seeking relief that\nwould interfere with the ongoing state dependency\nproceedings by placing decisions that are now in the \nhands of the state courts under the direction of the\nfederal district court.  The declaratory judgment and\ninjunction that they request would interfere with the\nstate proceedings in numerous ways.  The federal and\nstate courts could well differ, issuing conflicting\norders about what is best for a particular plaintiff,\nsuch as whether a particular placement is safe or\nappropriate or whether sufficient efforts are being\nmade to find an adoptive family.  The federal court\nrelief might effectively require an amendment to a\nchild’s case plan that the state court would not have\napproved, and state law gives its courts the\nresponsibility for deciding upon such an amendment. . .\n. .  To say the least, taking the responsibility for a\nstate’s child dependency proceedings away from state\ncourts and putting it under federal court control\nconstitutes “federal court oversight of state court\n156\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 161 of 199 - Page ID # 2930\noperations, even if not framed as direct review of\nstate court judgments” that is problematic, calling for\nYounger abstention. . . . The relief that the\nplaintiffs seek would interfere extensively with the\nongoing state proceedings for each plaintiff. \n31 Foster Children, 329 F.3d at 1278-1279 (dismissing plaintiffs’\nsubstantive and procedural due process claims, constitutional\nclaims for denial of family association, claims based on alleged\nviolations of the AACWA and EPSDT on the basis of Younger\nabstention).  See also J.B., 186 F.3d at 1291-92 (concluding\nYounger abstention was required because the plaintiffs’ federal\naction would interfere with the proceedings of New Mexico’s\nChildren’s Court in that the federal court would, in effect,\nassume an oversight role over the entire state program for\nchildren with disabilities).\nCiting Kenny A., the plaintiffs argue that their litigation\nis directed at the HHS department, not the courts, and any\nfederal order would assist rather than interfere with the\njuvenile court by imposing higher standards on HHS.  The Georgia\njuvenile court system at issue in Kenny A. distinguishes that\ncase from this lawsuit.  As noted by Kenny A., “under Georgia\nlaw, once the juvenile court grants legal custody of a child to\nDFCS, the court is powerless to order DFCS to give physical\ncustody of the child to any particular foster parent or otherwise\nrestrict the actual placement of the child.”  Kenny A., 218\nF.R.D. at 286 n. 6.  In Kenny A., the juvenile court’s authority\nover the state social service department was very limited, and\nthe federal court could arguably assist that juvenile court by\nissuing orders against the state agency, orders that the juvenile\ncourt itself was powerless to enter.  Such is not the case in\nNebraska.\n157\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 162 of 199 - Page ID # 2931\n  \nArticle V, § 27 of the Nebraska Constitution authorized the\nNebraska legislature to “establish courts to be known as juvenile\ncourts, with such jurisdiction and powers as the Legislature may\nprovide.”  Ne. Const. Art. V, § 27.  Consistent with this\nauthority, the legislature enacted Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-285 which\nstates:   \nWhen the court awards a juvenile to the care of the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, an\nassociation, or an individual in accordance with the\nNebraska Juvenile Code, the juvenile shall, unless\notherwise ordered, become a ward and be subject to the\nguardianship of the department, association, or\nindividual to whose care he or she is committed.  Any\nsuch association and the department shall have\nauthority, by and with the assent of the court, to\ndetermine the care, placement, medical services,\npsychiatric services, training, and expenditures on\nbehalf of each juvenile committed to it. \nNeb. Rev. Stat. § 43-285(1)(LEXIS 2005)(emphasis added). \nAccordingly, “[e]ven though any remedial order would run against\nthe Department, state law makes it a duty of state courts to\ndecide whether to approve a case plan, and to monitor the plan to\nensure it is followed.”  31 Foster Children, 329 F.3d at 1279. \nExercising federal court oversight over HHS’ conduct on behalf of\na child would serve to duplicate the authority already afforded\nto the Nebraska juvenile court by the Nebraska legislature. \nFederal court injunctive orders against HHS would undermine and\ninterfere with the Nebraska juvenile court’s ability to exercise\nthe full extent of its authority over juvenile court proceedings.\n158\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 163 of 199 - Page ID # 2932\n4. The State Proceedings Provided the Federal Plaintiff\nwith an Adequate Opportunity to Raise the Federal\nClaims.\nThe plaintiffs in this case seek widespread reform of the\nNebraska’s child welfare system, which is governed by a complex\nsystem of state statutes and regulations and aimed at an\nimportant state interest--the care and protection of children. \nFederal lawsuits seeking orders to “fix” portions of the state’s\nintegrated system raise substantial abstention issues.   As\nstated by the United States Supreme Court in Moore v. Sims, 442\nU.S. 415 (1979):\n     The breadth of a challenge to a complex state statutory\n     scheme has traditionally militated in favor of\n     abstention, not against it.  This is evident in a\n     number of distinct but related lines of abstention\n     cases which, although articulated in different ways, \n     reflect the same sensitivity to the primacy of the\n     State in the interpretation of its own laws and the\n     cost to our federal system of government inherent in\n     federal-court interpretation and subsequent\n     invalidation of parts of an integrated statutory\n     framework.\nMoore, 442 U.S. at 427.  However, “[t]he notions of comity\nunderlying Younger abstention do not compel federal courts to\nrefrain from hearing federal statutory and constitutional claims\nwhen the pending state proceeding is an inadequate or\ninappropriate forum for pursuing these claims.”  LaShawn A. by\nMoore v. Kelly, 990 F.2d 1319, 1322 (D.C. Cir. 1993). \nThe pertinent issue is not whether the plaintiffs’ claims\nwere raised in the pending state proceedings, but whether they\ncould have been raised.  That the plaintiffs’ juvenile court\nproceedings have not specifically addressed, for example,\n159\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 164 of 199 - Page ID # 2933\ninsufficient supervision by HHS caseworkers is not the\ndetermining factor.  “The question is whether that challenge can\nbe raised in the pending state proceedings subject to\nconventional limits on justiciability.”45  Moore, 442 U.S. at 425\n(holding the district court should have abstained under Younger\nfrom considering a constitutional challenge to portions of Texas’\nstatutory scheme for investigating suspected child abuse, though\nnot every issue, including whether its computerized system for\ncollecting and disseminating child-abuse information was\nconstitutional, had been raised in a state judicial proceeding).\nThe plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that their\nindividual claims could not be adequately raised in Nebraska’s\njuvenile court.  J.B., 186 F.3d at 1292 (citing Pennzoil Co. v.\nTexaco, Inc., 481 U.S. 1, 14-15 (1987); Moore, 442 U.S. at 432). \nThe plaintiffs must prove they could not have obtained a juvenile\ncourt ruling protecting them from HHS’ allegedly unlawful conduct\nwhich caused them harm or the imminent risk of future harm,\neither because the juvenile court had no jurisdiction to consider\nthe federal questions raised in this case, had no authority to\naward a remedy, or because the plaintiffs lacked adequate\nrepresentation in that forum.  \nNebraska juvenile courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,\nbut as previously discussed, these courts have very broad power\nto issue rulings for the protection and welfare of children.  The\nplaintiffs appear to be arguing that the juvenile court lacks the\n45On this issue, I note that the amended complaint does not\nidentify any plaintiff harmed by every alleged act of HHS\nmisconduct, and as to some of the claims, none of the plaintiffs\nhave alleged resulting harm.  For example, none of the plaintiffs\nalleges he or she was personally harmed by HHS’ use of an\noutdated computer database system.  \n160\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 165 of 199 - Page ID # 2934\nfunctional equivalent of federal question subject matter\njurisdiction--that it is not empowered to issue a ruling that HHS\nviolated or will likely violate the plaintiffs’ rights under\nfederal constitutional or statutory law.  \nClaims challenging statutes as unconstitutional can be\nraised in the Nebraska juvenile court.  In re Kantril P., 257\nNeb. 450, 458, 598 N.W.2d 729, 737 (1999)(affirming the juvenile\ncourt’s denial of a motion to dismiss where the parent argued\nthat § 43-272.01(2) is unconstitutional and deprived her\nconstitutional right to due process of law).  A Nebraska\nappellate court will not consider a constitutional question\narising in juvenile cases unless the question was properly\npresented in the first instance to the juvenile court for\ndisposition.  In re Phyllisa B., 265 Neb. 53, 58, 654 N.W.2d 738,\n742 (2002);  In re Interest of Rachael M., 258 Neb. 250, 254-255,\n603 N.W.2d 10, 14 (1999).\n \nMoreover, the precise question is not whether a Nebraska\njuvenile court can be called upon to issue a ruling declaring\nthat specific HHS policies violate the constitution or federal\nlaw.  Rather, the plaintiffs must prove the juvenile courts\ncannot adequately consider evidence of HHS’ conduct or likely\nfuture conduct toward the individual plaintiffs, determine if\nsuch conduct violates their rights under federal constitutional\nor statutory law, and enter orders protecting the plaintiffs from\nHHS’ allegedly unlawful conduct.  A “federal court should assume\nthat the state procedures will afford an adequate remedy, in the\nabsence of unambiguous authority to the contrary.”  Pennzoil Co.,\n481 U.S. at 14.  The court “will not engage any presumption ‘that\nthe state courts will not safeguard federal constitutional\nrights.’”  Norwood, 409 F.3d at 904 (quoting Neal v. Wilson, 112\n161\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 166 of 199 - Page ID # 2935\nF.3d 351, 357 (8th Cir. 1997) (quoting Middlesex County Ethics\nComm., 457 U.S. at 431)).  There is no evidence before this court\nindicating that Nebraska’s juvenile court judges are unaware of\nor unable to interpret the federal statutory or constitutional\nlaws governing or impacting their rulings and procedures, nor to\nthe extent a party claims federal law was violated at the\njuvenile court level, that appellate review is not available in\nthe Nebraska Court of Appeals or Supreme Court.\nThe plaintiffs argue that the juvenile court forum cannot\nprovide class-wide relief and therefore is not an adequate forum\nfor resolution of their claims.  I have concluded that a class\nshould not be certified.  Moreover, as the court held in Joseph\nA. ex rel. Corrine Wolfe v. Ingram, 275 F.3d 1253, 1274 (10th\nCir. 2002), there is no persuasive authority holding “that a\nparty is entitled to avoid the effects of the Younger abstention\ndoctrine in cases where relief is available to individual\nlitigants in ongoing state proceedings but not to represented\nparties in a class action.”  Joseph A., 275 F.3d at 1274.46  \n46Although the court in Kenny A. held that the Georgia\njuvenile court could not afford an adequate forum for plaintiffs’\nrequested class-based relief, it reasoned that under Georgia law,\n“[e]ven in individual cases, the juvenile court cannot order DFCS\nto provide a particular placement for a child, develop new\nplacements, or enter orders regarding staff training, caseloads,\nthe creation of new resources or other issues affecting what\nhappens to children who come before it.”  Kenny A., 218 F.R.D. at\n287.  Brian A. ex rel. Brooks v. Sundquist, 149 F. Supp. 2d 941,\n957 (M.D. Tenn. 2000) held that “[a]lthough technically\nPlaintiffs could raise constitutional questions in their\nindividual juvenile proceedings,” the juvenile court was not a\n“more appropriate vehicle” for litigating multifaceted requests\nfor broad-based, class-wide injunctive relief based on the\nConstitution and federal and state law.  However, in Brian A.,\nthe plaintiffs alleged that although Tennessee had extensive\njudicial and quasi-judicial procedures, the juvenile courts\nfailed to provide those procedures, failed to conduct\n162\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 167 of 199 - Page ID # 2936\nThe Nebraska juvenile court can exercise substantial control\nover HHS for the protection of a child, can issue rulings\ngoverning HHS’ conduct on behalf of that child, and can modify or\nreject HHS’s recommendations regarding a child’s care and\nplacement while in HHS custody.  The plaintiffs each have a\ncourt-appointed guardian ad litem to assist in the juvenile court\nproceedings--an attorney and officer of the court statutorily\nobligated to act for the plaintiff and protect his or her\ninterests.47  Neb.

No such allegations have been raised in\nthis case.\n47Though not specifically raised as an issue in this case,\nthe role of Nebraska guardians ad litem distinguishes Nebraska’s\nsystem from Georgia’s.  Kenny A. discussed the juvenile’s lack of\nmeaningful access to counsel as a basis for concluding juveniles\nin Georgia could not adequately raise federal claims in Georgia’s\njuvenile forum.  However, each of the named plaintiffs in this\ncase has a guardian ad litem appointed pursuant to Neb. Rev.\nStat. § 272.  Such guardians ad litem are attorneys, and absent a\nconflict of interest, these attorneys act as both a guardian ad\nlitem and an advocate for the child.  As explained in In re J.K.,\n265 Neb. 253, 257-258, 656 N.W.2d 253, 259 (2003):\n§ 43-272(2) and (3) envisions a dual role for an\nattorney appointed under these subsections.  First, the\nattorney serves as guardian ad litem.  Generally, a\nguardian ad litem determines the best interests of the\njuvenile and reports that determination to the court. .\n. .  Under the Nebraska Juvenile Code, the guardian ad\nlitem is given somewhat broader powers; he or she not\nonly determines and reports to the court what is in the\njuvenile's best legal and social interests, but also\nadvocates that position.  Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-272.01.\n. . .  Second, an attorney appointed under § 43-272(2)\nand (3)) serves as counsel for the juvenile.  As\ncounsel, an attorney is required to zealously advocate\nthe wishes of the juvenile (as opposed to the best\ninterests of the juvenile), as long as those wishes are\nwithin the bounds of the law. . . .\n163\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 168 of 199 - Page ID # 2937\nI conclude that as to each individual plaintiff, the issues\nraised in this case could have been (or could be) adequately\nraised before the juvenile court.  “Unless plaintiffs can adduce\nspecific evidence indicating that agency inaction has neutered\nthe Juvenile Court--an act which plaintiffs’ pleadings fail to\naccomplish--this court has no choice but to abstain under\nYounger.”  Laurie Q., 304 F. Supp. 2d at 1207 (interpreting\nCalifornia’s comparable juvenile court system and dismissing the\nplaintiffs’ AACWA case under Younger abstention).  See also 31\nFoster Children, 329 F.3d at 1280-82 (holding New Mexico’s\njuvenile court provided an adequate forum where each plaintiff\nwas represented by counsel, no procedural constraints prevented\npresentation of the claims, and the court was authorized to\nconsider the case plan, the appropriateness of placements, the\nlength of time in foster care, any special needs of the child,\nand any issues of family visitation); J.B., 186 F.3d at 1292-93\n(finding abstention under younger where the plaintiffs failed to\nprove New Mexico Children's Court, which had “wide power” to\ndetermine the needs and claims of children, lacked jurisdiction\nor ability to adjudicate federal statutory and constitutional\nclaims during authorized periodic review proceedings). \nI conclude that child welfare and protection is an important\nstate interest, the injunctive relief at issue in this case, if\ngranted, will interfere with the ongoing jurisdiction and\nproceedings for each plaintiff in the Nebraska juvenile court,\nand that court provides an adequate opportunity to raise the\nfederal claims asserted in this action.

The disputed issue is whether either\nstatute creates a federal right that can be enforced by the named\nplaintiffs under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

The amendment required State plans to provide for\npayment of services through the use of rates (determined in\naccordance with methods and standards developed by the State)\nwhich the State assured, to the satisfaction of the Secretary,\nwere reasonable and adequate.  The Court reasoned that the care\nproviders were intended beneficiaries of the amended statute.\n“The provision establishes a system for reimbursement of\nproviders and is phrased in terms benefitting health care\nproviders.”  Wilder, 496 U.S. at 510.  The state plan was\nmandatory in that states “must” “provide for payment. . . of\nhospital[s]” according to rates the State finds are reasonable\nand adequate,” and receipt of federal funds was expressly\nconditioned on reasonable and adequate state payments.  Wilder,\n496 U.S. at 512.  Wilder further held that the obligation was not\n“too vague and amorphous” to be judicially enforceable because\nboth the statute and accompanying regulations set out factors a\nState was to consider in adopting its rates and the statute\nprovided the objective benchmark of an “efficiently and\neconomically operated facility.”  Wilder, 496 U.S. at 519.  \nWhile there may be a range of reasonable rates, there\ncertainly are some rates outside that range that no\nState could ever find to be reasonable and adequate\nunder the Act.  Although some knowledge of the hospital\nindustry might be required to evaluate a State’s\nfindings with respect to the reasonableness of its\nrates, such an inquiry is well within the competence of\nthe Judiciary.\nWilder, 496 U.S. at 519-20.\nIn Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), the Court\nfurther clarified the standard for determining whether a\nparticular statutory provision can give rise to a federal private\n167\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 172 of 199 - Page ID # 2941\nright of action.  The Court’s three-part test, commonly known as\nthe “Blessing test,” provided: \nFirst, Congress must have intended that the provision\nin question benefit the plaintiff. . . .  Second, the\nplaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly\nprotected by the statute is not so “vague and\namorphous” that its enforcement would strain judicial\ncompetence. . . .  Third, the statute must\nunambiguously impose a binding obligation on the\nStates.  In other words, the provision giving rise to\nthe asserted right must be couched in mandatory, rather\nthan precatory, terms.\nBlessing, 520 U.S. at 340 (citing Wright, 479 U.S. at 430-32;\nWilder, 496 U.S. at 510-511; Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17).  \nThe Blessing test was re-examined by the Court in Gonzaga\nUniversity v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002).  The defendants in this\naction argue that Gonzaga substantially limited the holdings of\nWilder and Blessing.  The plaintiffs argue Gonzaga simply re-\nemphasized and explained the Blessing test.  \nIn Gonzaga, the Supreme Court held that certain privacy\nprovisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of\n1974 (“FERPA”) created no personal rights enforceable under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983.  Gonzaga reiterated the Blessing test but noted\nthat since several courts disagreed on how those opinions should\nbe applied, the Court’s prior opinions “may not be models of\nclarity.”  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 278.  The Court granted\ncertiorari “to resolve the conflict among the lower courts and in\nthe process resolve any ambiguity in [its] own opinions.” \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 278.  Specifically, the Court noted that the\nlanguage in Blessing could be read to “suggest that something\nless than an unambiguously conferred right is enforceable by §\n1983.”  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 282.  Blessing had been interpreted\n168\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 173 of 199 - Page ID # 2942\nby some courts “as allowing plaintiffs to enforce a statute under\n§ 1983 so long as the plaintiff falls within the general zone of\ninterest that the statute is intended to protect; something less\nthan what is required for a statute to create rights enforceable\ndirectly from the statute itself under an implied private right\nof action.”  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283. Gonzaga expressly\n“reject[ed] the notion that [the Court’s] cases permit anything\nshort of an unambiguously conferred right to support a cause of\naction brought under § 1983.”  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283.  “[I]t\nis rights, not the broader or vaguer ‘benefits’ or ‘interests,’\nthat may be enforced under the authority of that section.” \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283. \nRelying on the foregoing cases, the Eighth Circuit very\nrecently clarified the applicable three-part test for determining\nwhether Spending Clause legislation, such as the AACWA and the\nEPSDT, creates a private right of action enforceable under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983.  Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496 (8th Cir.\n2006).  In Lankford, the plaintiffs, who were disabled adult\nMedicaid recipients, sought an injunction prohibiting the\nMissouri Director of Social Services from enforcing a new state\nregulation which curtailed providing durable medical equipment\n(“DME”) to Medicaid recipients other than blind persons, pregnant\nwomen, needy children, or those who receive home health care\nservices under the state plan.  The plaintiffs sought to enjoin\nenforcement of the Missouri regulation because it allegedly\nviolated federal comparability and reasonable-standards laws\nrequiring states to treat Medicaid recipients equally and with\nreasonable, non-discriminatory standards.  42 U.S.C. §§\n1396a(a)(10)(B), (a)(17).  \n169\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 174 of 199 - Page ID # 2943\nLankford held that the plaintiffs had no individualized\nfederal right to reasonable Medicaid standards enforceable under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Lankford explained:\nFor legislation enacted pursuant to Congress's spending\npower, like the Medicaid Act, a state's non-compliance\ntypically does not create a private right of action for\nindividual plaintiffs, but rather an action by the\nfederal government to terminate federal matching funds. \nSee Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S.\n1, 28, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981).  While\nthe Supreme Court has rarely found enforceable rights\nin spending clause legislation, it has not foreclosed\nthe possibility that individual plaintiffs may sue to\nenforce compliance with such legislation.  See Wright\nv. City of Roanoke Redevelopment & Hous. Auth., 479\nU.S. 418, 430, 107 S.Ct. 766, 93 L.Ed.2d 781 (1987)\n(Federal Housing Act supports a cause of action under\nsection 1983); Wilder v. Va. Hosp. Ass'n, 496 U.S. 498,\n510, 110 S.Ct. 2510, 110 L.Ed.2d 455 (1990) (Medicaid\nproviders had an individual right to reasonable\nreimbursement rates under the now-repealed Boren\nAmendment).  Still, the Court has since limited the\ncircumstances where a private right of action is found\nunder section 1983.  See Suter v. Artist M., 503 U.S.\n347, 363, 112 S.Ct. 1360, 118 L.Ed.2d 1 (1992)(no\nprivate right of action under the Adoption Assistance\nand Child Welfare Act, which requires states to make\n“reasonable efforts” to keep children out of foster\nhomes); Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 344-45,\n117 S.Ct. 1353, 137 L.Ed.2d 569 (1997)(no private right\nof action under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act,\nwhich requires states to “substantially comply” with\nrequirements designed to ensure timely payment of child\nsupport); Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 290, 122 S.Ct. 2268 (no\nprivate right of action under the Family Educational\nRights and Privacy Act, which prohibits federal funding\nof educational institutions that have a policy of\nreleasing confidential records to unauthorized\npersons).\n  \nLankford, 451 F.3d at 508.  \n170\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 175 of 199 - Page ID # 2944\nWhere, as in this case, the plaintiffs seek recovery under a\nstatutory scheme as broad as Title IV-E and Title IV-B of the\nSocial Security Act, the plaintiffs must identify with\nparticularity the rights the claimed.  “Only when the complaint\nis broken down into manageable analytic bites can a court\nascertain whether each separate claim satisfies the various\ncriteria we have set forth for determining whether a federal\nstatute creates rights.”  Blessing, 520 U.S. at 342.  To\ndetermine whether specific Spending Clause legislation creates a\nprivate right of action enforceable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the\ncourt must consider whether:\n(1) Congress intended the statutory provision to\nbenefit the plaintiff; \n(2) The asserted right is not so “vague and amorphous”\nthat its enforcement would strain judicial\ncompetence; and \n(3) The provision clearly imposes a mandatory\nobligation upon the states.  \nLankford, 451 F.3d at 508 (citing and affirming continued use of\nthe Blessing test).  If so, it is presumably enforceable under §\n1983.  This presumption is rebutted if Congress explicitly or\nimplicitly forecloses section 1983 enforcement, but the\navailability of administrative mechanisms alone cannot defeat the\nplaintiffs’ claim under § 1983 if the other requirements of the\nthree-part test are met.  Lankford, 451 F.3d at 508 (citing\nBlessing, 520 U.S. at 341, 347).\nA. The AACWA.\nThe AACWA provides for federal reimbursement for certain\nexpenses incurred by the states in administering foster care and\n171\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 176 of 199 - Page ID # 2945\nadoption services if the state satisfies the requirements of the\nAct.  To participate in the program, a state must submit a plan\nfor approval by the Secretary of Health and Human Services which\nincludes severally statutorily imposed requirements.  The\nplaintiffs herein claim their rights secured under some of these\nstatutorily imposed plan requirements--specifically, the\nrequirements of 42 U.S.C. §§ 622(b)(10)(B), 627(b)(2), 671(a)(1),\n671(a)(10), 671(a)(11), 671(a)(15), 671(a)(16), 671(a)(19),\n671(a)(22), 672, 675(1), 675(4), 675(5)(B), 675(5)(D), 675(5)(E),\nand 45 C.F.R. Parts 1355-1357--have been and will continue to be\nviolated absent federal declaratory and injunctive relief.  \n1. 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(15). \nThe plaintiffs allege the defendants “are engaging in a\npolicy, pattern, practice, or custom of depriving Plaintiffs the\nrights individually conferred upon them,” including “the right of\neach Plaintiff child to a timely written case plan containing\nmandated elements, and to the implementation of this plan;. . .\nthe right of each Plaintiff child whose permanency goal is\nadoption to planning and services to obtain a permanent\nplacement, including documentation of the steps taken to secure\npermanency; [and] the right of each Plaintiff child to services\nto facilitate that child’s return to his family home or the\npermanent placement of the child in an alternative permanent\nhome.”  Filing 64 (Amended Complaint), ¶ 186.  \nThese allegations attempt to raise claims under 42 U.S.C. §\n671(a)(15).

In Suter v. Artist M., 503 U.S. at 359 (1992), a class of\nfoster children48 brought an action for injunctive relief\n48The defendants in Suter did not object to class\ncertification.  Suter, 503 U.S. at 353.  The opinion does not\naddress whether a class should have been certified.  \n174\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 179 of 199 - Page ID # 2948\nalleging the state violated § 671(a)(15) of the AACWA by failing\nto make reasonable efforts to prevent removal of children from\ntheir homes and facilitate reunification of families.  Suter held\nthat § 671(a)(15) did not create a private right of action\nenforceable under § 671(a)(15).  \nThe Suter opinion identifies at least three reasons for this\nfinding:\n• The AACWA “places a requirement on the states, but that\nrequirement only goes so far as to ensure that the\nState have a plan approved by the Secretary” which\ncontains the requirements of the Act.  Suter, 503 U.S.\nat 358 (emphasis added).  The accompanying regulations\nalso provided no notice that anything other than\nsubmitting a plan was required as a condition for\nreceipt of federal funds.  Suter, 503 U.S. at 362. \n• “[I]f Congress intends to impose a condition on the\ngrant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously.” \nSuter, 503 U.S. at 356.  However, neither § 671(a)(15)\nnor the regulations adopted pursuant to the AACWA\nprovided specific, detailed guidance as to how the\nstate’s “reasonable efforts” were to be measured.  To\nthe extent the statutes and regulations imposed a\ndirective on the states, the meaning of that directive\n“obviously var[ied] with the circumstances of each\nindividual case,” and the decision of how to comply\nwith the Act was left largely to the discretion of the\nState.  Suter, 503 U.S. at 359-360. \n• While the Act does not include a comprehensive\nenforcement mechanism clearly indicating Congress’\nintent to foreclose remedies under § 1983, it\nnonetheless did permit the Secretary to impose\nconsequences for the state’s lack of “reasonable\nefforts” as required under § 671(a)(15).  The Secretary\nwas permitted to reduce or eliminate payments to a\nState if the State’s plan failed to comply, or the plan\nadministration substantially failed to comply with §\n671(a).  Therefore, the Act could be enforced without\nresort to private claims under § 1983.  Suter, 503 U.S.\nat 360-361.  \n175\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 180 of 199 - Page ID # 2949\nAccordingly, Suter held:\nCareful examination of the language relied upon by\nrespondents, in the context of the entire Act, leads us\nto conclude that the “reasonable efforts” language does\nnot unambiguously confer an enforceable right upon the\nAct’s beneficiaries.  The term “reasonable efforts” in\nthis context is at least as plausibly read to impose\nonly a rather generalized duty on the State, to be\nenforced not by private individuals, but by the\nSecretary in the manner previously discussed.\nSuter, 503 U.S. at 363.\nFollowing Suter, courts grappled and disagreed over whether\nSuter modified, effectively overruled, or imposed additional\nrequirements to the Blessing test for Spending Clause cases. \nStowell v. Ives, 976 F.2d 65, 69-70 (1st Cir. 1992)(Suter “held\nthat an intended recipient of programmatic benefits could not sue\nunder section 1983 if the federal statute merely required that\nthe State submit a plan to a federal agency satisfying certain\ncriteria, because such a ‘requirement only goes so far as to\nensure that the State have a plan approved by the Secretary which\ncontains [the listed criteria].’”); Marshall v. Switzer, 10 F.3d\n925, 929 (2d Cir. 1993)(“[T]he significant point in Suter was not\nthat the statute in question only required a state to submit a\nplan to the federal agency but that the statute provided no\nguidance for measuring “reasonable efforts.”); White by White v.\nChambliss, 112 F.3d 731, 739 (4th Cir. 1997)(“Suter itself was\nnot a novel holding, but rather rested upon settled legal\nprinciples with regard to private rights of action in the context\nof the AACWA.”); Arkansas Medical Soc., Inc. v. Reynolds, 6 F.3d\n519, 525 (8th Cir. 1993)(holding Suter did not create an\nanalytical framework to replace or overrule previous Supreme\nCourt rulings, but it did place “great emphasis on the fact that\n176\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 181 of 199 - Page ID # 2950\nrights must be ‘unambiguously’ conferred to be enforceable,” and\n“each statute must be examined on its own basis.”); Jeanine B.,\n877 F. Supp. at 1282-83 (Suter “announced a new approach to\nfederal funding statutes requiring plans, stating that the only\nprivate right arising from such statutes is a right to the plan\nitself, and not to the implementation of the plans’ required\nprovisions.”).  \nIn 1994, Congress enacted the following amendment, (often\ncalled the “Suter fix”), in response to the Suter decision.  \nIn an action brought to enforce a provision of this\nchapter, such provision is not to be deemed\nunenforceable because of its inclusion in a section of\nthis chapter requiring a State plan or specifying the\nrequired contents of a State plan.  This section is not\nintended to limit or expand the grounds for determining\nthe availability of private actions to enforce State\nplan requirements other than by overturning any such\ngrounds applied in Suter v. Artist M., 112 S.Ct. 1360\n(1992), but not applied in prior Supreme Court\ndecisions respecting such enforceability; provided,\nhowever, that this section is not intended to alter the\nholding in Suter v. Artist M. that section 671(a)(15)\nof this title is not enforceable in a private right of\naction.\n42 U.S.C.A. § 1320a-2.  The courts have not uniformly interpreted\nthe meaning of § 1320a-2.  Compare Brian A., 149 F. Supp. 2d at\n946 (reading the Suter fix as requiring lower courts to apply\npre-Suter case law) and Marisol A., 929 F. Supp. 2d at 682\n(same); Jeanine B. 877 F. Supp. at 1283 (holding the court must\n“rewind the clock” and look to cases prior to Suter to determine\nthe enforceability of AASWA provisions other than § 671(a)(15)),\nwith Harris v. James, 127 F.3d 993, 1002-03 (11th Cir.\n1997)(holding § 1320a-2 does not requires application of\npre-Suter case law); White v. Chambliss, 112 F.3d 731, 739 n.4\n177\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 182 of 199 - Page ID # 2951\n(4th Cir. 1997)(holding that § 1320a-2 had no effect at all on\nthe application of Suter to future cases).\nThe confusion lies in the following statutory phrasing: \n“This section is not intended to limit or expand the grounds for\ndetermining the availability of private actions to enforce State\nplan requirements other than by overturning any such grounds\napplied in Suter v. Artist M., 112 S.Ct. 1360 (1992), but not\napplied in prior Supreme Court decisions respecting such\nenforceability.”  The courts had not yet determined whether Suter\nactually announced a new principle of law, but were now\nstatutorily required to disregard any new pronouncements made in\nSuter.  However, of the three grounds identified in Suter, the\npotentially “new” criteria arose from Suter’s discussion of\nwhether the provisions of a state plan could provide the basis\nfor a federal private right of action when the statute itself (§\n671(a)(15)) merely required any federally approved plan to\ninclude certain provisions.  Suter, 503 U.S. at 358.49\nAccordingly, most courts hold that if § 1320a-2 effectively\noverruled anything in Suter, it overruled only that portion of\nthe opinion identifying and allowing a court to rely exclusively\non the “state plan” criteria in determining the existence of a\nfederal right.  A provision of the Medicaid act cannot be “deemed\nunenforceable by an individual merely because the provision\n49In other words, must a private right of action arise from\nviolating the statute itself, or can it arise from failing to\nimplement the plan provisions that were required by statute?  The\nanalogous question is whether federal regulations adopted to\nimplement a federal statute have the “force of law” sufficient to\nprovide the basis for a federal private right of action.  See the\nextensive discussion at Harris v. James  127 F.3d 993, 1005-10\n(11th Cir. 1997).\n178\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 183 of 199 - Page ID # 2952\ncontains state plan requirements.”  Watson v. Weeks  436 F.3d\n1152, 1158 (9th Cir. 2006).  See also S.D. ex rel. Dickson v.\nHood, 391 F.3d 581, 603 (5th Cir. 2004); Harris v. James  127\nF.3d 993, 1002 (11th Cir. 1997); Doe by Fein v. District of\nColumbia, 93 F.3d 861, 876 n. 1 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  “The mere fact\nthat all the Medicaid laws are embedded within the requirements\nfor a state plan does not, by itself, make all of the Medicaid\nprovisions into ones stating a mere institutional policy or\npractice rather than creating an individual right.”  Rio Grande\nCommunity Health Center, Inc. v. Rullan, 397 F.3d 56, 74 (1st\nCir. 2005)(interpreting § 1320a-2). \n42 U.S.C.A. § 1320a-2 does not, however, alter Suter’s\nultimate conclusion that § 671(a)(15) of the AACWA is not\nenforceable in a private right of action.  First, the language of\nthe statute specifically states:  “[T]his section is not intended\nto alter the holding in Suter v. Artist M. that section\n671(a)(15) of this title is not enforceable in a private right of\naction.”  \nSecond, the primary, or at least the alternative basis for\nthe Suter ruling was the Court’s determination that the AACWA\nlacked specific, detailed guidance as to how the state’s\n“reasonable efforts” were to be measured.  Suter, 503 U.S. at\n356-360.  Absent such information, the right is so “vague and\namorphous” that enforcement of the act would strain judicial\ncompetence.  Wilder identified this independent basis for finding\nno private right of action in 1990, two years before Suter, and\nthe criteria is now the second prong of the Blessing test. \nBlessing, 520 U.S. at 340; Wilder, 496 U.S. at 510-511.  The\nreasoning from Suter based on “prior Supreme Court decisions\nrespecting such enforceability” remains in effect under the\n179\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 184 of 199 - Page ID # 2953\nexpress language of 42 U.S.C.A. § 1320a-2.  Therefore, Suter’s\nholding that § 671(a)(15) does not create a private enforceable\nright under the second prong of the Blessing test was unaltered\nby 42 U.S.C.A. § 1320a-2 and remains the law.  I therefore\nconclude that to the extent the plaintiffs seek injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief under 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(15),50  no private\nright of action exists, and the defendant’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion\nto dismiss should be granted. \n2. 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(1), 672, and 675(4).\nUnder 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(1), the state’s federally approved\nplan must provide “for foster care maintenance payments in\naccordance with section 672 of this title and for adoption\nassistance in accordance with section 673 of this title.” \nSection 672 outlines the eligibility requirements and\ncircumstances under which the state must pay foster care\nmaintenance payments.  “The term ‘foster care maintenance\n50The plaintiffs’ complaint alleges a listing of the AACWA \n“rights” violated, and then string-cites the statutory references\nat the end.

As previously\nstated, § 671(a)(15) would appear to encompass the plaintiffs’\nclaim that the defendants have violated the “the right of each\nPlaintiff child to a timely written case plan containing mandated\nelements, and to the implementation of this plan;. . . the right\nof each Plaintiff child whose permanency goal is adoption to\nplanning and services to obtain a permanent placement, including\ndocumentation of the steps taken to secure permanency; [and] the\nright of each Plaintiff child to services to facilitate that\nchild’s return to his family home or the permanent placement of\nthe child in an alternative permanent home,” (filing 64 (Amended\nComplaint), ¶ 186).\n \n180\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 185 of 199 - Page ID # 2954\npayments’ means payments to cover the cost of (and the cost of\nproviding) food, clothing, shelter, daily supervision, school\nsupplies, a child's personal incidentals, liability insurance\nwith respect to a child, and reasonable travel to the child's\nhome for visitation.”  42 U.S.C. § 675(4)(A). \nThe plaintiffs’ amended complaint alleges the defendants’\npolicies, practices and customs deprive the plaintiffs of their\nright to have “foster care maintenance payments paid to the\nfoster parents or foster care providers with whom the child is\nplaced that cover the actual cost (and the cost of providing) the\nPlaintiff child’s food, clothing, shelter, daily supervision,\nschool supplies, reasonable travel to visitation with family, and\nother expenses.”  Filing 64 (Amended Complaint), ¶ 186.\nRelying on Missouri Child Care Ass'n v. Martin, 241 F. Supp.\n2d 1032 (W.D.Mo. 2003), the plaintiffs claim “Congress intended\nPlaintiffs to have the right to foster care maintenance payments\n(to be paid on their behalf to foster parents or foster care\nproviders with whom the child is placed). . . .  Filing 88\n(Plaintiffs’ Brief--Motion to Dismiss), p. 52.  Missouri Child\nCare held that foster care institutional providers had an\nenforceable right under § 672 to seek an order requiring the\ndefendants to determine a reimbursement rate for the costs of\ncare and services provided to foster children.  The court\nreasoned that the reimbursement provisions of § 672 were intended\nto benefit foster care institutions and such institutions had\nstanding to pursue the claims. \nMissouri Child Care is not persuasive authority for\nrecognizing a private right of action on behalf of the named\nplaintiffs.  Missouri Child Care held that the foster care\n181\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 186 of 199 - Page ID # 2955\nproviders, not the foster children, can pursue a private claim to\nset foster care rates.  As noted by Missouri Child Care, in\nenacting § 672, “Congress would . . . have been aware that as a\ngeneral proposition foster care institutions, not foster\nchildren, would be in a better position to enforce those rights,\nthereby ensuring the continued implementation of congressional\nintent.”  Missouri Child Care, 241 F. Supp. 2d at 1041.  \nFoster children do not directly receive the benefit of a\nclaim brought under § 672, and while adequate foster care\nmaintenance payments may enhance the likelihood of increasing the\navailable pool of foster parents, such indirect benefits do not\nsupport a private right of action in favor of the named\nplaintiffs.  See Blessing, 520 U.S. at 344-345 (holding that\ncompliance with Title IV-D’s detailed requirements for state data\nprocessing systems and staffing in exchange for federal funding\nof the state’s child support payment collection system did not\ncreate a federal right enforceable against the state under §\n1983).  The link between increased foster care maintenance\npayments and the services provided to any particular child “is\nfar too tenuous” to support the notion that Congress meant to\ngive each and every Nebraska juvenile in foster care a right to\nhave foster care providers paid at a sufficient level.  See\nBlessing, 520 U.S. at 345.  For the purpose of determining if a\nfederal private right of action exists, the named plaintiffs are\nnot the intended beneficiaries of 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(1), 672,\nand 674(4)(A).\nAlthough Missouri Child Care held to the contrary, I also \nconclude the plaintiffs cannot assert a right to foster care\nmaintenance payments under the second prong of the Blessing test. \nMissouri Child Care held that the plaintiffs’ claims were\n182\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 187 of 199 - Page ID # 2956\nindistinguishable from the type of claims asserted in Wilder. \nWilder held that under federal Medicaid statutes and regulations,\nhealth care providers had an enforceable right to reimbursement\nat “reasonable and adequate rates,” but the statutes and\nregulations under consideration in Wilder included specific\nfactors to be considered in determining the methods for\ncalculating rates.  Wilder, 496 U.S. at 519.  For example, Wilder\nnoted:\n[W]hen determining methods for calculating rates that\nare reasonably related to the costs of an efficient\nhospital, a State must consider:  (1) the unique\nsituation (financial and otherwise) of a hospital that\nserves a disproportionate number of low income\npatients, (2) the statutory requirements for adequate\ncare in a nursing home, and (3) the special situation\nof hospitals providing inpatient care when long-term\ncare at a nursing home would be sufficient but is\nunavailable. \nWilder, 496 U.S. at 520 n. 17.  Suter, decided two years later,\nnoted that the specific statutory and regulatory methods for\ncalculating rates in Wilder supported finding a private right of\naction for the health care providers.  However, no private right\nof action existed in Suter because § 671(a)(15) and its\nregulations provided no guidance as to how the “reasonable\nefforts” required under § 671(a)(15) were to be measured.\nWith respect to “foster care maintenance payments,” neither\n§ 672 nor the definition of that term in § 675(4)(A) provide any\nlanguage for discerning how rates should be set for paying foster\ncare providers the “cost” of caring for a foster child, and in\nthe case of institutional care, “the reasonable costs of\nadministration and operation of such institution as are\nnecessarily required” to care for a foster child.”  42 U.S.C. § \n675(4)(A).  The plaintiffs’ brief cites to no regulations\n183\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 188 of 199 - Page ID # 2957\ngoverning the calculation of foster care maintenance payments.  I\ntherefore disagree with Missouri Child Care, and conclude that\nlike § 671(a)(15), and in accord with the analysis of Suter, the\nplaintiffs’ asserted right to foster care maintenance payments is\ntoo “vague and amorphous” to support a federal right enforceable\nunder § 1983.  Compare ASW v. Oregon, 424 F.3d 970, 975-76 n.9\n(9th Cir. 2005)(holding § 673 created an individual right to\nadequate adoption assistance payments where the statute required\nan individualized process with each family to determine the\namount by mutual agreement with the state which could be\nreadjusted only “with the concurrence of the adopting parents,\ndepending upon changes” in the circumstances.  “Unlike foster\ncare maintenance payments, codified in a standardized rate\nschedule, § 673(a)(3) explicitly creates a right to\nindividualized payment determinations for adoption assistance\npayments.” Id. at 976 n. 9).\nThe plaintiffs’ claim under 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(1), 672, and\n674(4)(A) fails under both the first and second prongs of the\nBlessing test.  These claims should be dismissed under Rule\n12(6)(6).\n3. 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(10) and (11).\n42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(10) requires federally approved state\nplans to provide for the “establishment or designation of a State\nauthority or authorities which shall be responsible for\nestablishing and maintaining standards for foster family homes\nand child care institutions which are reasonably in accord with\nrecommended standards of national organizations concerned with\nstandards for such institutions or homes,” and to provide that\n“the standards so established shall be applied by the State to\n184\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 189 of 199 - Page ID # 2958\nany foster family home or child care institution receiving funds.\n. . .”  42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(11) requires periodic review of these \nstandards.  The plaintiffs’ amended complaint alleges the\ndefendants violate and continue to violate their right “to\nplacement in a family foster home or institutional placement that\nis licensed, re-licensed and operated in conformity with national\nstandards.”  Filing 64 (Amended Complaint), ¶ 186.\nSection § 671(a)(10) does not create an individual federal\nright enforceable under § 1983.  White by White v. Chambliss, 112\nF.3d 731, 739 (4th Cir. 1997).  \nThe requirement that a state's plan be “reasonably in\naccord with recommended standards of national\norganizations,” is no more specific than section\n671(a)(15)’s “reasonable efforts” requirement. \nFurthermore, the AACWA provides no “statutory guidance”\nto clarify the meaning of the requirements of\n671(a)(10).  Lastly, section 671(a)(10) is enforceable\nthrough the same alternative enforcement mechanism\nprovided for section 671(a)(15).  As the Supreme Court\nnoted in Suter, “[t]he Secretary [of Health and Human\nServices] has the authority to reduce or eliminate\npayments to a State on finding that the State’s plan no\nlonger complies with § 671(a) or that ‘there is a\nsubstantial failure’ in the administration of a plan\nsuch that the State is not complying with its own\nplan.” . . .  Suter thus forecloses the argument that\nsection 671(a)(10) of the AACWA provides the source for\nan enforceable right through section 1983.\nWhite, 112 F.3d at 739.

Under 42 U.S.C. §\n1320a-2, the Secretary “in consultation with the State agencies\nadministering the State programs . . . shall promulgate\nregulations for the review of such programs to determine whether\n[they] are in substantial conformity with-- (1) State plan\nrequirements under such parts B and E, (2) implementing\nregulations promulgated by the Secretary, and (3) the relevant\napproved State plans.”  42 U.S.C. § 1320a-2.  Section 1320a-2\nrequires the regulations to specify a timetable for conformity\nreviews of State programs, including when the initial review will\noccur, when any follow up review will occur if the state program\nis not in substantial conformity, and the schedule for less\nfrequent reviews if the state program is in substantial\nconformity.  The regulations must address the criteria used to\nmeasure conformity, and the withholding of federal funds when a\nstate program does not substantially conform.  42 U.S.C. § 1320a-\n2 (1-4). \nFederal statutes requiring operation of a program in\n“substantial compliance” with federal law are not intended to\nbenefit individuals, and cannot create federal rights.  Blessing,\n520 U.S. at 343.  Blessing held that a provision in Title IV-D of\nthe Social Security Act which required a state receiving federal\nchild-welfare funds to “operate its child support program in\n‘substantial compliance’ with Title IV-D was not intended to\nbenefit individual children and custodial parents, and therefore\n[did] not constitute a federal right.”  Blessing, 520 U.S. at\n343.  \n     T]he requirement that a State operate its child\n     support program in “substantial compliance” with Title\n     IV-D was not intended to benefit individual children\n     and custodial parents, and therefore it does not\n191\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 90   Filed: 08/16/06   Page 196 of 199 - Page ID # 2965\n     constitute a federal right.  Far from creating an\n     individual entitlement to services, the standard is\n     simply a yardstick for the Secretary to measure the\n     systemwide performance of a State's Title IV-D program. \n     Thus, the Secretary must look to the aggregate services\n     provided by the State, not to whether the needs of any\n     particular person have been satisfied. \nBlessing, 520 U.S. at 343.  Based on that determination, the\nSecretary can increase the frequency of audits and reduce\nthe state’s federal grant to induce or improve the state’s\nsystemwide performance level, both of which are reasonable means\nfor enforcing a Spending Clause statutory scheme.  Blessing, 520\nU.S. at 343-44.\nThough the case plans and reviews contemplated under §§ 622\nand 671(a)(16) are specific to each child, Congress expects the\nstates to “substantially comply” with these statutes in exchange\nfor federal funds.  42 U.S.C. §§  622(b)(10)(B), 671(a)(16),\n675(1), and 675(5)(B, (D), and (E) have an “aggregate” focus. \nThey are not concerned with “whether the needs of any particular\nperson have been satisfied,” and they cannot “give rise to\nindividual rights.”  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 288-289.  Where the\nfederal statute focuses on the aggregate practices of the states\nin establishing reasonable Medicaid services and not on\nindividual entitlement to medical services, the first requirement\nof the Blessing test is not met.

The defendants in this action ate Dave Heineman, as \n-1-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 2 of 57 - Page ID # 3\nGovernor of the State of Nebraska;  Nancy Montanez, as  the Director of Services, Nebraska \nHHS; Dr. Joann Schaefer, as the Director of Regulation and Licensure, Nebraska HHS; Richard \nNelson, as the  Director of Finance and Support, Nebraska HHS; Dennis Loose, as the Chief \nDeputy Director of Services, Nebraska HHS; and Todd Reckling, Administrator ofHHS' Office \nof Protection  and  Safety (collectively, the  \"Defendants\").  All  Defendants  are  sued in their \nofficial capacities, as the administrators ofNebraska's child welfare system. \n2.  Defendants' failure to protect Nebraska's foster children and provide them \nwith legally-required services subjects these children to significant and ongoing hann, deprives \nthem of a chance for a safe and stable childhood, and violates their rights under the United States \nConstitution and various federal  statutes.  This action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief \nagainst Defendants to stop continuing violations of the legal rights ofNebraska's foster children \nand to prevent Defendants, by their actions and  inactions, from continuing to  harm the very \nchildren that rely on the State for their care and protection. \nINTRODUCTION \n3.  There  are  more  than  6,000  abused,  neglected  or  otherwise  deprived \nchildren in the custody of HHS.  Instead of providing these traumatized and vulnerable children \nwith a  safe  and  temporary home,  Nebraska's  mismanaged,  overburdened  and under-funded \nfoster care system routinely further harms them and allows them to deteriorate, without the basic \ncare, services, protection and opportunities for a permanent home that are necessary for their \nphysical, emotional and psychological development and well-being. \n4.  As  a result of serious  systemic deficiencies that have been !mown to \nDefendants for many years, the \"Jebraska foster care system operated by HHS inflicts numerous \nharms on abused and neglected children while they are in state custody, including: \n-2-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 3 of 57 - Page ID # 4\na.  Frequent moves among multiple inappropriate placements.  Subjecting \nfoster children, especially those who have undergone the trauma of being \nremoved from an abusive or neglectful home, to repeated changes in their \nprimary  caregivers  causes  serious  harm  to  their  development  and \npsychological  health.  Yet data  collected by HHS  and reported  to  the \nfederal govemment shows that, of the children in Defendants'  custody \nduring  fiscal  year  2004,  nearly  32%  had  experienced  four  or  more \nplacements during their current stay in foster care.  In another example, \nthe annual report issued by the Nebraska. Foster Care Review Board in \n2004 (the \"FCRB 2004 Report\") found that 50% of all children in \"out-of \nhome\" foster care as of the last day of 2003 had experienced four or more \nplacements during their time in foster care, and over 30% of those children \nhad been moved six or more times. \nb.  Excessive stays in emergency shelters and other temporary facilities. \nNebraskan children first  entering foster care and those already in  state \ncustody who have their foster homes or other placements \"disrupt\" are \nroutinely left for extended periods of time, sometimes many months, in \ninappropriate emergency shelters and other temporary facilities intended \nfor very limited stays (no more than 30 days), often for the simple reason \nthat the State has nowhere else to place them.  Treatment services are \nfrequently lacking in the shelters, and these facilities often randomly mix \nyouth  who  have  been  adjudicated  delinquent  with non-offenders,  and \nchildren with aggressive physical  or sexual behaviors  with  young and \nvulnerable children. \nc.  The  placement  of infant  and  other  very  young foster  children  in \nemergency shelters and other temporary faciliiies.  In  addition to  the \nham1fnl extended use of emergency shelters for children generally, group \ncare facilities designed :tor very short stays are being regularly used  as \nplacements for infants, toddlers and other young children, sometimes tor \nextended periods of time, again often because appropriate placements are \nunavailable.  TI1e  care  of young  children· forming  critical  bonds  and \ndevelopmental  skills  through  shifts  of caretakers  in  group  facilities  is \ndamaging to these children. \nd.  Overcrowded foster homes.  As a result of the lack of homes and other \nplacements for foster children, foster homes are regularly overcrowded, \nsometimes housing more than six children at a time (many of them with \nspecial needs).  Such overcrowding prevents adequate parental supervision \nand places children at risk ofharm. \ne.  Maltreatment of foster children while in State custody.  Far too often \nchildren brought into Nebraska's foster care custody because of abuse or \nneglect at the hands of their own biological parents or other caregivers are \nsubject to further maltreatment while in  the custody of the State.  This \nmaltreatment occurs  because of the  State's  failure  to  (i)  appropriately \n-3-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 4 of 57 - Page ID # 5\nscreen and oversee foster homes, (ii) segregate sexually reactive children \n(otlen  themselves  the  victim  of  prior  sexual  abuse)  or  physically \naggressive children from other foster children, and (iii) adequately monitor· \nand supervise visits between foster children and their biological family \nmembers when problems that have not been addressed place children at \nrisk ofhann. \nf.  Overuse of institutional placements for children.  Due to a lack of foster \nhomes, Nebraskan foster children are inappropriately placed in institutions \nand other congregate facilities when they could be appropriately placed \nwith foster  families.  The State also continues to place young children \n(including children  under eight years  of age) in institutions and  group \nfacilities,  denying  them  individualized treatment and important one-on \none relationships with consistent caregivers. \ng.  Excessive lengths of stay in State custody.  Nebraskan foster children are \nunnecessarily spending large portions of their lives - and sometimes their \nentire  childhoods  in  foster  care.  Defendants  fail  to  provide  foster \nchildren with appropriate case management, case plans and the services, \nincluding  adoption-related  services,  required  to  prevent  children  from \ngrowing up  in  state  custody.  Nebraskan  foster  children are  routinely \ndenied  opportunities to be adopted,  and many are discharged from the \nfoster care system at or around the State's age of majority without the life \nskills necessary for them to live independently. \n5.  These continuing harms to children are caused by a number of severe and \nlong-standing systemic deficiencies that plague Nebraska's foster care system, including: \na.  A severe shortage offoster homes.  HHS fails to maintain an adequate \nnumber and kind of foster homes and other appropriate placements for \nfoster children.  Foster children are placed wherever a bed or \"slot\" is \navailable and not according to their individual needs . \n. b.  High  caselmtds  and  turnover.  HHS  caseworkers  responsible  for \noverseeing the care and protection of children in the State's custody often \nhave  dangerously  high  caseloads  that  are  frequently  multiples  of the \nnational standard of 12-15 foster children per caseworker.  High caseloads \nand an unsupportive environment for mauy caseworkers have led to very \nhigh twnover rates.  In urban areas, caseworkers fi·equently  leave atlcr \nworking with HHS for one or two years and many leave well before that \ntime, often before they have even completed their training. As  a result, \nfi·ontline staff members are frequently inexperienced. \nc.  Poor monitoring of child safety.  Nebraska's  foster homes  are often \ninadequately screened for safety.  For example, the FCRB 2004 Report \nfound that, in over 25% of the \"out-of-home\" foster care cases reviewed \n-4-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 5 of 57 - Page ID # 6\nby the Board during calendar year 2003, children were placed in homes \nthat were  unsafe,  inappropriate or had never undergone  a documented \nsafety assessment.  Additionally, high caseloads interfere with the ability \nof easeworkers to adequately monitor the safety of foster children assigned \nto them.  Recent state data shows that, for January 2005, at least 36% of \nfoster children statewide did not receive a required monthly contact from \ntheir caseworker. \nd.  A  lack of basic health serl'ices for foster children.  Nebraska's foster \nchildren are routinely denied services necessary to address acute mental \nhealth problems on the basis of cost.  These children are left in  foster \nhomes that are unable to meet their needs and in which their mental health \nfurther deteriorates.  Foster children are also denied timely basic medical \nexaminations and dental health services.  · \ne.  Poor planflillg alld services to quickly move children out off oster care \nalld into permanent homes.  HHS routinely fails to provide foster children \nwith appropriate  case  management,  case plans  and  services,  especially \nadoption-related services, that are required to ensure that children do not \ngrow up languishing in State custody. In a 2002 audit of HHS, the federal \ngovernment  identified  the  failure  to  establish  goals  for  children's \npennanent placement and the  failure  to  achieve  adoptions  in  a timely \nmanuer as \"critical problems.\"  These same \"critical problems\" continue \ntoday. \nf.  Gross{v illadequate payments to foster care prol•iders.  Nebraska fails to \nprovide payments to those caring for foster children that even approach \nthe actual east of care.  For example, HHS pays foster parents as little as \n$222 per month  less than $8 per day - to raise a two-year-old foster \nchild, when the federal  government estimates that the average monthly \ncost of raising a child in the nrral United States is $755 and even more in \nthe urban Midwest. \ng.  Fiscal waste.  Nebraska regularly fails to collect available federal funds \ntor foster children in State custody, foregoing many millions of dollars \nthat could be used to provide despenttely needed homes and services for \nchildren. \n6.  The  harn1s  routinely  inflicted  on  children  in  Nebraska's  foster  care \ncustody, and the systemic deficiencies and pattern and practice of conduct from which they arise, \ncause the overall physical, emotional and psychological deterioration of foster children while in \nState custody. \n-5-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 6 of 57 - Page ID # 7\n7.  Defendants have long been aware of HHS' ongoing and systemic failure \nto provide for the safety and well-being of Nebraska's foster children, as all of these deficiencies \nhave been repeated] y  documented  in  governmental  reports,  audits  and  in the  media.  Yet \nDefendants have been unable or unwilling to address them.  The serial reform plans Defendants \nhave issued over the years have failed to ameliorate the ongoing systemic deficiencies and harms \nto Nebraska's foster children detailed in this Complaint. \n8.  These and other actions and inactions of Defendants subject Nebraska's \nfoster children to significant and ongoing harms, deprive them of a chance for a safe and stable \nchildhood, and violate their rights under the United States Constitution and federal statutes.  This \nlawsnit seeks declaratory and injtmctive relief to stop these ongoing legal violations and the \nserious harms that flow from them and ensure that Defendants adequately care for and protect \nchildren in state custody, as required by law.  \n.JURSIDICTION AND VENUE \n9.

The legal violations alleged by the Named Plaintiffs are typical of those \nraised by each member of the putative class.  The banns suffered by the Named Plaintiffs are \ntypical of the harms suffered by all children in the putative class. \n37.  Each Named Plaintiff appears by a next fiiend pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n17(c),  and  each next  friend  is  sufficiently  familiar  with  the  child's  situation  to  fairly  and \nadequately represent the child's best interest in this litigation. \n38.  The Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nmembers of the putative class. \n-1 1- \n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 12 of 57 - Page ID # 13\n39.

Carson, now eight years old, has been in HHS custody for approximately \ntwo years.  A victim of sexual abuse and fetal alcohol syndrome, Carson has serious mental and \nbehavioral health needs.  Throughout his term in foster care Carson has routinely been, and is \n-12-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 13 of 57 - Page ID # 14\nnow being, denied access to treatment and services appropriate to these significant needs, to his \ngreat detriment. \n43.  Carson  came  into  HHS  custody in  September 2003  as  a  six-year-old. \nWhen police officers arrived at Carson's house,  they fouud him carrying around  an axe and \ndetermined that he had  access  to  other weapons,  including a knife,  and drug paraphernalia. \nCarson had been encouraged to drink alcohol and smoke in the home and at the time of removal \nhis teeth were severely decayed. \n44.  Carson  was  placed  into  a  foster  home  that  was  provided  almost  no \ninfonnation about his medical, emotional and mental health needs and the circumstances nnder \nwhich he came into care. \n45.  After  several  months  in  foster  care,  Carson reported  being repeatedly \nsexually abused prior to  removal.  Carson  was taken to be interviewed at Project Harmony, \nOmaha's Child Advocacy Center, but he became frightened and was unable to  complete the \ninterview process. \n46.  Though Carson talks openly of his desire to harm and even kill people, \nhears voices, and describes dreams in which he molests other children, he was not assessed in \nany formal manner at or around the time he came into care and HHS has consistently impeded \nany and  all  efforts  to  obtain  appropriate  treatment  for  Carson's  various  mental  health and \nbehavioral problems. \n4 7.  During his first eight months in  foster care,  Carson's HHS caseworker \nfailed to visit him even a single time.  For much of this period he was provided with no therapy \nwhatsoever, despite repeated requests by those charged with his care who were witnessing his \ntroubling symptoms and behaviors first-hand.  When Carson's caseworker finally approved basic \n-13-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 14 of 57 - Page ID # 15\ntherapy by a counselor, not a psychologist, it was insufficient to even begin to match Carson's \nneeds, because, among other reasons, he received only a single 30-minute session every two \nweeks. \n48.  In the months following Carson's first outcry about his sexual abuse, he \nbegan speaking about the abuse in more explicit detail with his foster parents and, eventually, \nwith his therapist.  These allegations were referred to Carson's HHS case manager.  The case \nmanager, however, refused to report the allegations, and they were not investigated, despite the \nfact that one of the alleged perpetrators was Carson's biological mother's boyfriend and Carson's \npermanency plan was then, as it still is today, reunification with Carson's biological mother. \n49.  Though Carson has remained in care far longer than 15 of the most recent \n22 months, Carson's permanency goal remains reunification and a petition seeking termination \nof his parental rights has not yet been filed.  HHS has also not yet even begun the process of \nlocating Carson's biological father. \n50.  Throughout most of his nearly two-year stay in foster care, Carson has \nbeen denied any visits with siblings, cousins, and other family members. \n51.  The foster care maintenance payments made to Carson's foster parents on \nhis behalf have consistently failed to cover the actual costs of caring for him. \n52.  HHS recently placed Carson with a relative who has not been adequately \ntrained or otherwise prepared to address Carson's substantial needs, a problem made worse by \nthe grossly inadequate therapy being provided him. \n53.  Defendants' actions and inactions are part of a systemic pattern of conduct \nthat has  caused Carson,  and continues  to  cause  Carson, irreparable harm.  Defendants have \nviolated,  and  acted  in  deliberate  indifference  to  and  beyond  the  bounds  of reasonable \n-14-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 15 of 57 - Page ID # 16\nprofessional  judgment regarding,  Carson's  constitutional  and  statutory  rights  by  failing  to \nprovide necessary services and an appropriate placement for him; by failing to make periodic \ncomprehensive  assessments  of his  needs,  including his  mental  health  needs,  and  providing \nservices  consistent  with  those  needs;  by  failing  to  make  timely  and  meaningful  casework \ncontacts and monitor his progress in foster care in order to ensure his safety and well-being; by \nfailing to provide him with monitoring and services necessary to prevent him from deteriorating \nphysically, psychologically, emotionally, educationally or otherwise while in state custody; by \nfailing to pay foster care maintenance payments on his behalfihat cover the reasonable costs of \ncaring for him; by failing to support his fan1ily relationships, in particular by not providing child \nsibling visits; by failing to provide appropriate management and supervision while he has been in \nHHS custody in ac.cordance with his individual needs, best interests, and reasonable professional \nstandards; by failing to provide case management and planning in accordance with his individual \nneeds,  best  interests,  and reasonable  professional  standards;  and by failing  to  develop  and \nimplement a viable permanent plan that will allow him to leave foster care and secw·e a safe and \nappropriate  permanent  home  in  accordance  with  his  individual  needs,  best  interests,  and \nreasonable professional standards. \nPaulette V. \n54.  Paulette V. has been languishing in the State's foster care custody for most \nof the last twelve years, during which time she has been physically or sexually abased on three \nseparate occasions and has been subjected to at least 17 different foster placements, a nmnber of \nthem dangerous and clearly inappropriate to meet her needs.  Paulette, who will be turning 19 \nyears old in less than a year, has not been provided a legally mandated written transitional living \nplan and other services necessary to adequately prepare her for adulthood. \n-15-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 16 of 57 - Page ID # 17\n55.  Paulette was  removed  from her biological mother's care  into  the  legal \ncustody of HHS when she was five years old.  Upon entering the system, HHS separated Paulette \nfrom her younger brother and sister who were also taken into foster care, and she was denied \nvisitation with them for more than 10 years. \n56.  HHS  originally placed Paulette in  a relative foster home in the Omaha \narea, more than 350 miles t!·om where she was living at the time she came into care.  During the \ncourse of Paulette's approximately five-year stay at this home, the relative with whom she was \nplaced was incarcerated for a drug offense.  HHS did not seek to remove Paulette from the home \nat the time or otherwise appropriately monitor her safety and the adequacy of supervision in the \nhome.  To the contrary, she was only rarely visited by her HHS caseworker.  At age 10, as HHS \ncontinued in its  failure  to monitor Paulette's safety and  well-being, Paulette was  repeatedly \nsexually abused by an older boy living in the home. \n57.  Paulette  was  then  sent by HH.S  to  live  with  a  more  distant  relative. \nNotwithstanding her prior sexual abuse, HHS  ananged for Paulette to  receive  only minimal \ncounseling.  Given her past experiences, Paulette found the stress of living with a number of \nolder boys in the home intolerable and she was moved by HHS to yet another relative placement, \nher fourth foster home since entering care. \n58.  Paulette lived in this home, which eventually took legal guardianship of \nher, for about three years.  In this home, Paulette was physically abused by her relative foster \nparent.  She reported the abuse.  However, despite extensive bruising, no action was taken either \nby the police or by HHS.  Paulette came back into HHS legal custody when, at the  age of 13, she \nwas  agam  sexually abused,  this  time by a  boyfriend  of her relative foster  parent  and  then \nguardian. \n-16-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 17 of 57 - Page ID # 18\n59.  Paulette was next shuffled through a string of group homes.  The repeated \nand  serious  psychological  and  physical traumas  she had suffered during her  years  in  HHS \ncustody manifested themselves in increasingly difficult to control behaviors.  She was eventually \ntransferred by HHS  to  a highly restrictive  residential  treatment center,  where she  lived for \napproximately six months.  Though Paulette attended an in-house school in the facility, none of \nthe credits she earned while in this school were accepted once she retumed to mainstream public \nschooL and, as a result, she was forced to repeat the  Grade. \ngth \n60.  HHS  then  sent Paulette to yet another relative  foster home,  where she \nlived tor nearly two years.  The pattern of scarce visitation by HHS and inadequate counseling \ncontinued.  This placement was also eventually fonualized into a guardianship, but only three \nmonths later Paulette came back into foster care when she attempted suicide and HHS had her \nplaced in a psychiatric hospital for several months. \n61.  Upon discharge from this psychiatric hospital, HHS placed Paulette in a \nprivately nm Omaha emergency shelter to await yet another foster placement.  She remained in \nthis inappropriate facility for approximately three months while HHS purportedly sought to find \nher an appropriate home.  The shelter, intended for extremely short stays of up to 30 days, was \npopulated by a mix of delinquent,  neglected  and  abused teens and  some younger children, \nincluding children less than five years of age.  HHS next placed Paulette in a different shelter in \nOmaha where she resided for over a month before rmming away after a dispute with another \nresident.  She was then kept for a number of days in a locked facility. \n62.  Paulette was then placed by  HHS  for nearly  two  years  in a series of \nrestrictive  group placements,  including  a residential  treatment center, operated by a  private \nprovider.  She continued to be visited by HHS only sporadically during this time.  She repeatedly \n-17-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 18 of 57 - Page ID # 19\nasked her HHS caseworker to be transferred to a family home but was told that no such homes \nwere available. \n63.  In late 2004, as a 17-year-old, Paulette was at last placed by HHS into a \nfamily foster home, at least her l7'h foster care placement  Paulette- now 18 years of age  has \nnot been involved in the required process of developing and implementing a Written Transitional \nLiving Plan and is not otherwise being adequately prepared for her transition to adulthood at age \n19, a transition that will surely be harder for Paulette given the many harms inflicted upon her \nduring her years in HHS custody. \n64.  Defendants' actions and inactions are part of a systemic pattern of conduct \nthat has caused Paulette, and continues to cause Paulette, irreparable harm.  Defendants have \nviolated,  and  acted  in  deliberate  indifference  to  and  beyond  the  bounds  of reasonable \nprofessional judgment regarding,  Paulette's  constitutional  and  statutory  rights  by  tillling  to \nprotect her from  ham1; by failing to provide necessary services and an appropriate permanent \nplacement for her;  by failing  to make periodic comprehensive assessments of her needs; by \nplacing  her  in  inadequately  screened  and  monitored  foster  homes;  by  placing  her  into \ncircumstances while in HHS custody which Defendants knew or should have known would have \nand did render her vulnerable to danger, placed her at risk of harm and which in fact resulted in \nsevere harm to her; by failing to make timely and meaningful casework contacts and monitor her \nprogress in foster care in order to ensure her safety and well-being; by placing her in emergency \nshelters for more than thirty days and contrary to her individual needs and best interests; by \nfailing to provide her with monitoring and services necessary to prevent her from deteriorating \nphysically, psychologically, emotionally, educationally or otherwise while in  state custody; by \nfailing to support her family relationships by not providing child-sibling visits; by failing to \n~ 18-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 19 of 57 - Page ID # 20\nprovide  appropriate  management  and  superv1s1on  while  she  has  been  in  HHS  custody  in \naccordance with her individtml needs, best interests, and reasonable professional standards; by \nfailing to provide case management and planning in accordance with her individual needs, best \ninterests, and reaBonable professional standards; by  failing to develop and implement a viable \npermanent plan  that  will  allow  her to  leave  foster  care and  secure a  sate  and  appropriate \npermanent  home  in  accordance  with  her  individual  needs,  best  interests,  and  reasonable \nprofessional standards; and by failing to provide her with legally mandated independent living \nand transitional services to  enable her to live on her own once she is  discharged from  HHS \ncustody at age 19. \nDanielle D. \n65.  Daniello is a seven-year-old child who has spent the majority of her life in \nstate custody and is now more than two years into her second extended stay in foster care.  HHS \nhas failed to provide Danielle with the case planning and services needed to move her on to a \npermanent home.  In fact, for much of the last calendar year, Danielle 's permanency goal has \nbeen \"long term foster care,\" a manifestly inappropriate goal for an eminently adoptable child \nsuch as Danielle. \n66.  Danielle originally entered the foster care system as a toddler following \nthe drowning of her younger brother.  After approximately a year and a half in l-IHS custody, \nDanielle was returned home.  In 2003, Danielle re-entered the foster care system as a four-year \nold after one of her teachers reported signs of physical abuse. \n67.  Danielle is hearing impaired and significantly developmentally delayed. \nAt the time of her re-entry into foster care, Daniello had a hearing aide but had not been taught \n-19-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 20 of 57 - Page ID # 21\nhow to use it.  The foster care maintenance payments made to her ti.1ster parents on her behalf \nhave consistently failed to cover the actual costs of caring for her. \n68.  HHS failed to take necessary steps to provide Daniello's biological mother \nwith the services necessary to further the purported goal of reunification or to determine that \nreunification was inappropriate and implement another penuanency plan. \n69.  More than a year into Danielle's second foster care stay, it was detenuined \nthat Daniello's mother could not safely and appropriately care for Danielle.  Notwithstanding this \ndetermination and the fact that Daniello's foster mother had indicated that she was ready, willing \nand able to  adopt Danielle, instead of promptly seeking to  tenninate parental  rights  so that \nDanielle could be adopted, HHS  recommended that Danielle's permanency goal  be changed \nfrom reunification to \"long term foster care,\" clearly an inapprop1iate goal for a child as young \nas  Danielle  for  whom  a  potential  stable  and  permanent  adoptive  home  had  already  been \nidentified. \n70.  Although  a petition seeking tem1ination  of Danielle's mothers parental \nrights has recently been filed, HHS continues to fail to take reasonable steps to seek and secure a \npennanent and stable home for Danielle.  For example, HHS has not yet began the process of \nfinding  and terminating  the rights  of Danicl\\e's biological  father  or timely or appropriately \nfollowed-up  on Danielle's mother's claim of a tribal affiliation for Danielle, both necessary \nprecursors to Danielle actually achieving permanency. \n71.  During her time in foster care, HHS has failed to arrange for even a single \nvisit between Danielle and either of her sisters, both of whom have been in toster care for a \nnumber of years.  Moreover, HHS has failed to appropriately monitor the visits between Danielle \nand her mother, delegating responsibilities for such monitoring (and transportation to and from \n-20-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 21 of 57 - Page ID # 22\nthe visits) to a constantly changing corps oftmder-trained and inexperienced staff employed by a \nprivate subcontractor. \n72.  Defendants' actions and inactions are part of a systemic pattern of conduct \nthat has caused Danielle, and continues to cause Danielle, irreparable ha1m.  Detendants have \nviolated,  and  acted  i11  deliberate  indifference  to  and  beyond  the  bounds  of reasonable \nprofessional judgment regarding,  Danielle's  constitutional  and  statutory  rights  by failing  to \nprovide necessary services and an appropriate pennancnt placement for her; by failing to make \nperiodic comprehensive assessments of her needs; by failing to make timely and meaningful \ncasework contacts and monitor her progress in foster care in order to ensure her safety and well \nbeing; by failing to provide her with monitoring and services necessary to prevent her from \ndeteriorating physically, psychologically, emotionally, educationally or otherwise while in state \ncustody; by failing to support her family relationships by not providing child-sibling visits; by \nfailing to pay foster care maintenance payments on her behalf that cover the costs of caring for \nher; by failing to provide appropriate management and supervision while she has been in HHS \ncustody in  accordance  with her  individual  needs, best interests, and reasonable professional \nstandards; by failing tq provide case management and pla1ming in accordance with her individual \nneeds,  best interests,  and  reasonable professional  standards;  and  by failing  to  develop  and \nimplement a viable permanent plan that will allow her to leave foster care and secure a safe and \nappropriate  permanent  home  in  accordance  with  her  .individual  needs,  best  interests,  and \nreasonable professional st:mdards. \nChervl H. \n73.  Cheryl H. has been in foster care for nine years.  Because of HHS' failure \nto appropriately assess Cheryl's needs and place her in accordance with them and HHS' failure \n-21-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 22 of 57 - Page ID # 23\nto develop, train and support foster parents capable of meeting the needs of children like her, \nCheryl has um1ecessarily suffered through more than a dozen placement changes and has spent \nsignificant periods of her life in institutional settings.  As a result of HHS' failure to provide \nCheryl with appropriate treatment and case planning services, Cheryl has also been denied the \nopportunity for a stable home through adoption or guardianship.  Instead, she has been permitted \nto steadily deteriorate while in state custody. \n74.  Within a short time of coming into care, Cheryl  then only nine years old \nwas placed for an extended stay in a large group home, far from the biological mother with \nwhom the state· s plan was for her to be reunified.  When this placement disrupted, she was \nplaced with a pair of first-time foster parents who struggled tor a little under a year to meet her \nvery significant mental health and behavioral needs  with almost no  caseworker supervision, \nsupport (including respite services) or training from HHS.  On several  occasions dtuing her \nplacement  in  the  home,  Cheryl's  condition  deteriorated  to  the  point  that  she  required \nhospitalization in the children's ward of a psychiatric hospital, but each time she was returned to \ntl1e foster home without significant additional supports or services.  Ultimately that placement \nalso disrupted and Cheryl then spent more than a year living in an emergency children's shelter \nwith children of various ages and emotional, mental health and behavioral needs, a manifestly \ninappropriate placement for a troubled girl who was then only II years old. \n75 .  Cheryl's placement when she was at last moved from the shelter was with \nanother set of first-time foster parents, again with no special training in the provision of anything \nbut basic non-therapeutic foster  care.  This placement was  also punctuated by a number of \npsychiatric hospitalizations but, as before, no alternative placement or stabilization and support \nservices to the taster home were offered or tried. \n-22-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 23 of 57 - Page ID # 24\n76.  When this placement also disrupted, Cheryl was placed for a period of \ntime with a residential treatment center, and then moved through a number of group placements \noperated by the same provider that ran the treatment center.  At approximately the age of 16, \nCheryl was again placed in an unsupported \"traditional'' foster home that was ultimately unable \nto handle her.  When that placement disrupted,  she was retumed to a children's shelter for \napproximately  a  month,  and  is  currently  living  with  yet  another  foster  parent,  awaiting \nemancipation when she turns 19 in January 2006.  There is minimal planning being done for \nCheryl's future transition to adulthood, a future that looks uncertain at best in view of her many \nbehavioral, developmental and mental health problems -problems that have either been caused \nor exacerbated by her many years in foster care. \n77.  Defendants' actions and inactions are part of a systemic pattern of conduct \nthat has caused Cheryl, and continues  to  cause  Cheryl,  irreparable  harm.  Defendants  have \nviolated,  and  acted  in  deliberate  indifference  to  and  beyond  the  bounds  of reasonable \nprofessional judgment regarding, Cheryl's constitutional and statutory rights by failing to protect \nher from hann; by failing to provide necessary services and an appropriate permanent placement \nfor her; by failing to make periodic comprehensive assessments of her needs; by placing her in \ninadequately trained and supported foster homes;  by failing to make  timely and meaningful \ncasework contacts and monitor her progress in foster care in order to ensure her safety and well \nbeing;  by placing her  in  emergency shelters  for more  than thirty days  and  contrary  to  her \nindividual  needs  and best interests;  by  failing  to provide her  with  monitoring and  services \nnecessary  to  prevent  her  from  deteriorating  physically,  psychologically,  emotionally, \neducationally or otherwise while in state custody; by failing to provide appropriate management \nand supervision while she bas been in HHS custody in accordance with her individual needs, best \n-23-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 24 of 57 - Page ID # 25\ninterests,  and reasonable professional standards;  by tailing to provide case management and \nplanning in accordance with her individual needs, best interests, and reasonable professional \nstandards; by failing to develop and implement a viable pennanenl plan that will allow her to \nleave foster  care and secure a safe and appropriate pennanent home in accordance with her \nindividual needs, best interests, and reasonable protessional standards; and by failing to provide . \nher with legally mandated independent living and transitional services to enable her to live on \nher own once she is discharged from HHS custody at age 19. \nJacob P. \n78.  Jacob is  a 13-year-old boy who has been HHS  custody nearly half of his life. \nJacob is developmentally delayed with an extensive histmy of behavioral problems, many caused \nor exacerbated by his experiences in state custody.  During his time in foster care, Jacob has been \nshuffled amongst at least II different foster CHre placements, including five different placements \nin the past year and a half, many of which were wholly inappropriate to, and failed to meet, his \nextensive needs. \n79.  Jacob first came into HHS custody in December 1996, at age four.  Jacob was \nneglected medically and had been given alcohol by family members  in  order to  control his \nbehaviors. \n80.  After stays in a number of placements, including valious institutional settings, \nJacob was placed in a potentially adoptive home in August 1999, into which he was adopted in \nNovember 2000. \n81.  Throughout Jacob's adoption, he reported being slapped and otherwise verbally \nand emotional1y abused by his adoptive parents.  In November 2002, HHS investigated abuse \nallegations against his adoptive parents, but o±Tered no additional services to the family.  While \n-24-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 25 of 57 - Page ID # 26\nm  the  home,  another foster child,  who  had  also been  adopted by Jacob's adoptive parents, \nthreatened to kill Jacob.  In addition, Jacob allegedly acted out sexually towards this adoptive \nbrother. \n82.  As  a result of these  and other behaviors, Jacob's adoptive parents  repeatedly \nrequested that HHS provide services in order to help them successfully deal with Jacob's needs \nand behaviors, including inpatient treatment for Jacob's adoptive brother that wonld separate the \nboys.  HHS' contractor, Magellan, denied services to Jacob and his adoptive parents without \nreason.  Instead of offering services to keep  the family  intact,  HHS  offered the parents  an \ninformation packet  and threatened  the  adoptive  parents with  prosecution  if they  abandoned \nJacob's adopted brother. \n83.  Jacob's adoption disrupted and his adoptive parents relinquished custody back to \nHHS in February 2004.  Since that time, Jacob has had at least four placement changes and \ncurrently resides in a group home.  Although Jacob had been in care tbr many years prior to his \ndisrupted adoption, he was only recently tested  for Fetal  Alcohol Syndrome even though he \nexhibited  facial  features  consistent with the  diagnosis.  In addition,  Jacob was  not given a \nneuropsychological evaluation until December 2004. \n84.  As a result of his extensive time in State custody and multiple placement moves, \nJacob  suffers  from  severe  attachment  problems.  Though  Jacob  desperately  needs  the \npennanency that only a properly supported adoptive home can provide, his primary permanency \ngoal is not adoption, but rather gnardianship.  Although Jacob now has a concurrent goal of \nadoption, HHS has taken no steps towards that goal and Jacob is not currently listed on the HHS \nadoption website. \n-25-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 26 of 57 - Page ID # 27\n85.  Defendants' actions and inactions are part of a systemic pattern of conduct that \nhas caused Jacob, and continues to cause Jacob, irreparable harm.  Defendants have violated, and \nacted in deliberate indifference to and beyond the bounds of reasonable professional judgment \nregarding, Jacob's constitutional and statutory rights by failing to provide necessary services and \nan  appropriate  pennanent  placement  for  him;  by  failing  to  make  periodic  comprehensive \nassessments of his needs; by failing to provide him with monitoring and services necessary to \nprevent  him  from  deteriorating  physically,  psychologically,  emotionally,  educationally  or \notherwise while in state custody; by fililing to provide appropriate management and supervision \nwhile he has been in HHS custody in accordance with his individual needs, best interests, and \nreasonable  professional  standards;  by  failing  to  provide  case  management  and  planmng  in \naccordance with his individual needs, best interests, and reasonable professional standards; and \nby tailing to develop and implement a viable permanent plan that will allow him to leave foster \ncare and secure a safe and appropriate pcm1anent home in accordance with his individual needs, \nbest interests, and reasonable professional standards. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS REGA.RDING SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCIES AND \nTHE RESULTING HARMS TO FOSTER CHILDREN IN STATE CUSTODY \n86.  The described experiences of the Named Plaintiffs are not atypical, but \ninstead  are  all  too  common  illustrations  of Defendants'  pattern  and  practice  of deliberate \nindifference towards, and widespread and systemic failure to exercise and implement reasonable \nprofessional judgment regarding, the healtl1,  safety and welfare of the abused and neglected \nfoster children they are legally obligated to care for and protect. \n87.  Detendants have the authority and the legal responsibility to ensure that \nfoster children in state custody receive the services, care and protection to which they are legally \nentitled, yet past attempts  to  address the many pronounced ddicicucies  in Nebraska's child \n-26-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 27 of 57 - Page ID # 28\nwelfare  system,  and  in  particular its  foster  care  and adoption programs,  have been largely \n· ineffective  and  in  any  event  not  targeted  at  the  problems  delineated  in  this  Complaint. \nDefendants have long known of the injuries and ham1s suffered by Plaintiff children (and their \npredecessors in the State's foster care system) as a result of Defendants' pattern and practice of \naction and  inaction.  Their failure  to  take  the  steps necessary to  ameliorate  these  ongoing, \nsystemic  banns reflects a clear departure  from  any  reasonable exercise of their professional \njudgment, and is also in deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs health, safety and well-being. \nDangerous aud Inappropriate Foster Care Placements and Placement Processes \n88.  Plaintiff children who  have been traumatized by abuse and neglect and \nremoval from their homes are subject to  further hann while in the State's foster care system \nbecause  of a  grave  shortage  of appropriate  numbers  m1d  types  of foster  homes  and  other \nplacements, which results in the predictable cycling of children through numerous inappropriate \nand too often dangerous foster care placement'>. \n89.  Because of a severe shortage of foster care placements, an overburdened \nand insufficiently supported staff, and the absence of an appropriate and timely administered \nprocess  tbr assessing the needs of foster children, Plaintiff children who enter foster care in \nNebraska are routinely placed without regard to their specific needs or the training and capacity \nof the  foster parents or other caretakers with whom they are placed.  Instead, Plaintiffs are \nregularly placed wherever a bed or \"slot\" is available. \n90.  HHS  often  tails  to  collect  or  maintain  the  infom1ation  ne.:essary  to \nproperly match Plaintiff children with foster care homes or other placements.  For exan1ple, as of \nMarch  2004,  only  18%  of the  foster  parent  records  contained  information  regarding  the \n-27· \n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 28 of 57 - Page ID # 29\ncharacteristics of a child that the foster parents would accept into their home, and only 16% of \nthe foster children's records contained infom1ation about the children's characteristics. \n9L  HHS  caseworkers  routinely  place  Plaintiff children  in  foster  homes \nwithout providing the foster parents with adequate information concerning the children's medical \nand mental health history and needs, and without preparing the foster parents to deal with the \npredictable behaviors and treatment needs of the children placed in their homes.  AI; a result, \nfoster parents are frequently unaware of and unequipped to meet Plaintiff children's needs.  HHS \ncaseworkers are also often unresponsive to  foster parents'  requests for  additional support or \ninformation about foster children placed with them. \n92.  For foster children with needs that require intensive services or, in rare \ncases,  placement in group  or institutional  settings iliat can  provide an  even higher level  of \ntreatment and care, HHS consistently does not provide such services or placements unless and \nuntil the children \"tail\" in the Jess-supported (and less expensive) placements, those placements \ndisrupt, and those children snffer unnecessary and damaging additional placement moves.  This \nde facto requirement of \"failure\" before needed services and placements are provided is severely \ndamaging to Plaintiff children. \n93.  HHS' pattem and practice of placing children wherever a bed is available \ninstead of based on their individual needs, failing to develop and maintain appropriate foster \nhomes  and  other placements,  failing to  provide foster parents with sufficient preparation or \ninformation, and failing to provide children with expensive services and placement absent prior \nplacement  disruptions  or  other failures,  resnlts  in  a  high  rate  of psychologically  damaging \nplacement disruptions, with Plaintiff children being repeatedly and mmecessarily shuffled from \none placement to  another.  For example, HHS reported io the federal  govemment that from \n·28-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 29 of 57 - Page ID # 30\nOctober  2003  to  September  2004,  approximately  47%  of the  children  in  foster  care  had \nexperienced three or more placements and approximately 3.2 % of Nebraska's foster children had \n.  . \nexpenenced four or .more placements.  In the 2004 FCRB\" Report, the Board stated that, of the \nfiles reviewed of children who were in \"out-of-home\" foster care placement at the end of 2003, \nclose to 50% experienced four or more placement disruptions, and 33% had experienced six or \nmore placement dismptions while in foster care.  The Board expressed special concern about the \nnumber of placements experienced by pre-school age children, who can be particularly damaged \nby multiple  broken attaclnnents  with  care  givers.  Of the  files  reviewed  of pre-school  age \nchildren who were in \"out-of-home\" foster placement at the end of 2003, about 38'!/o had lived in \nthree or more different homes, and about 12% had lived in five or more homes. \n94.  Compounding the harm  done  to  Plaintiff children from  being shuffled \nfrom one placement to another, it is commonplace for HHS to move a child from a foster home \nabruptly without attempting to provide supportive services to either prevent the placement from \ndismpting or at least minimize the trauma of yet another change in a child's primary caregiver. \n95.  Each placement move by a foster child forces that child to seek to form \nnew attaclunents with adult caregivers.  PlaintitT children who suffer multiple placement moves \nfrequently become increasingly reluctant to love and trust their caretakers, sutl'er behavioral \nproblems, and become more difficult to place in pennanent homes.  Additionally, the frequent \nplacement moves  experienced by Plaintiff children directly interfere with their education, as \n2 The Nebr.tska Foster Care Review Board was created in 1982 pursuant to the Foster Care Review Act.  Neb. Rev. \nStat.§ 43-1301 et seq.  Among other statutory duties, the board is charged with (i} establishing and training local \nfoster care review boards tOr the conduct of six-month permanency review hearings for children in out~of-home \nstate custody, and (ii) aceumulating data and making repmis on chi1dren In out-of-home placements to HHS and the \njuvenile courts.  The FCRB 1s also authorized to visit and observe foster care facilities in order to ascertain whether \nthe individual physical, psychological, and sociological needs of each foster child are being mel  See Neb. Rev. \nStat.§§ 1303-1308. \n-29-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 30 of 57 - Page ID # 31\nmany of these unnecessary placement moves result in school changes, delays in the transfer of \nschool records, and delays in enrollment and unnecessary absences from school. \n96.  Because of an insufficient number and array of available foster homes, \nDefendants often rely on unsafe and inappropriate placements tor the care of Plaintiff children, \nincluding inadequately screened and monitored public (or ''traditional\") foster homes directly \nadministered by HHS; relative foster homes, also under the direct supervision of HHS; homes \nrecmited by agencies that contract with HHS; and homes and group or institutional placements \nrccmited and overseen by private providers. \n97.  There is an acute shortage in Nebraska of the therapeutic foster homes \nneeded to  accommodate children with emotional or behavioral problems.  Because HHS has \nfailed to  develop, train and support a sufficient number of therapeutic foster homes, Plaintiff \nchildren  are routinely placed in settings that are unable to  meet their needs and where they \nendanger their own development and safety as well as the safety of the other children with whom \nthey are placed  (including other foster  children  and  foster parents'  biological  and  adoptive \nchildren). \n98.  In addition to the harm directly inflicted upon Plaintiff children by the \nemotional trauma caused by each placement move, HHS' failure to match these children with \nhomes appropriate to their needs results in even longer stays in foster care for these children, and \nfurther hmm,  as  the  emotional and  behavioral  effects  of the placement moves  significantly \ndecreases their chances of ever being placed in a permanent home. \n99.  The  severe laek  of foster homes  also results  in  HHS  placing Plaintiff \nchildren for extended periods of time in emergency shelters that are intended only for very short \nstays.  In addition to failing to provide stability, these shelter placements often fail  to provide \n-30-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 31 of 57 - Page ID # 32\nchildren with adequate treatment services and fail to provide even rudimentary safety, as they \noften house together children of diverse ages and maturity levels, including youth who have been \nadjudicated to be delinquent with non-offenders and children with aggressive physical or sexual \nbehaviors  with  very  young and  vulnerable  children.  Although  these  emergency  shelter \nplacements are intended to be temporary and to last no more than 30 days, Plaintiff children \nfrequently remain for far longer periods-sometimes for four months or more  because the State \nhas nowhere else to place them and also, in some cases, because staff are too overwhelmed to \neven determine what placements are available for them. \n100.  In addition to the inappropriate use of sheltr->rs for all children, very young \nfoster children (including infants and toddlers) are regularly placed in emergency shelters and \nother temporary facilities, again because appropriate foster care placements are unavailable or in \nsome cases because staff are too overwhelmed to locate them.  The State's data indicates that in \nthe month of Apri1 2005 alone, more than 300 separate foster children spent time in emergency \nshelters in Nebraska.  The average age of children residing in shellers was 13.45 years, reflecting \nthe fact that a number of children staying in these facilities were in fact si!,'llificantly younger.  In \nthe North em Service Area the average age of children that spent time in shelters was 11.19 years, \na  product  of that region's  regular  placement  of infants  and  other very  young  children  in \nshe!tercare.  HHS'  care  of young children  forming  critical  bonds  and  developmental  skills \nthrough shifts of caretakers in gronp facilities  such as shelters or crisis nurseries is severely \ndamaging to these children. \nI 0 L  As a result of the lack of homes and other placements for foster children, \nfoster homes are regularly overcrowded and may include six or even more Plaintiff children, \n-31-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 32 of 57 - Page ID # 33\nexclusive of biological and  adoptive children living in the home.  Such overcrowding often \nprevents adequate parental supervision and places children at risk ofhann. \n102.  Another result of HHS' failure to develop and retain a sufficient number \nand array of foster homes is that Plaintiff children are often regnlarly placed in institutions and \nother congregate facilities .when they conld be appropriately placed with appropriately trained \nand supported foster families.  FIBS also continues to place young Plaintiff children (including \nchildren  under  eight  years  of  age)  in  non-tamily  settings.  Such  children  are  denied \nindividualized treatment and one-on-one relationships with a consistent caregiver by virtue of \ntheir institutionalization.  As the most common source of adoptive parents is foster parents, the \nState's placement of Plaintiff children in institutions decreases the likelihood that they will be \nadopted. \n103.  Defendants devote few resources to recruiting and retaining foster homes \nfor Plaintiff children and pay foster parents caring for Plaintiff children only a fraction of what it \ncosts to actually raise those children. \n104.  As it is legally obligated to do, Nebraska provides foster care maintenance \npayments for  the direct and intended benefit of most foster  children in the state's custody. \nHowever, these foster care maintenance payments are not set based on the actual and reasonable \ncosts and individual needs of the children themselves and are insufficient to provide essential and \nappropriate care and services to Plaintiff children.  For instance, FIBS pays many foster parents \nonly $222 a month- less than $8 a day- to raise a newborn to two-year-old child, when the \nfederal government estimates that it costs an average fan1ily $755 a month to raise a child of that \nage  in the  rural  United  States and  $761  a  month for the urban Midwestern United  States. \nNebraska's  $222  basic rate is the  lowest foster  maintenance payment in  the  country.  The \n-32-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 33 of 57 - Page ID # 34\nexceedingly low rates paid to foster parents taking care of the State's most vulnerable children \ninterfere  vvith  HHS'  ability  to  recmit  and  retain  foster  and  adoptive  families  for  Plaintiff \nchildren. \n105.  Similarly, the rates paid on behalf of Plaintiff children placed with private \nproviders - including some of the  state's  most damaged and vulnerable children - are  not \nestablished based on the actual needs of children and the reasonable eost of caring for them.  The \nfoster care maintenance payments provided for children placed with private providers, including \nthose in non-family settings, are insufficient to provide appropriate care and services to Plaintiff \nchildren. \n106.  Plaintiff children are regularly placed with foster parents to whom HHS \ndenies basic supportive services, such as appropriate respite care.  Additionally, HHS often fails \nto respond to foster parents' requests for assistance with services and instead often simply moves \nPlaintiff children rather than providing services and supports to prevent impending placement \ndisruptions. \n107.  In addition to the Plaintiff children that HHS places in \"out-of-home\" care, \nthere are approximately  1,500  children  in  the  legal custody of HHS  who  reside  with  their \nbiological parents or other caretakers, most of them on trial reunifications following stays in non \nrelative foster homes or other placements.  As with the children in \"ont-of-home\" care, these \nchildren  are  insufficiently monitored  and visited  by HHS  and  are  denied needed  services, \nincluding mental health services. \n108.  Far too often Plaintiff children brought into Nebraska's foster care custody \nbecause of abuse or neglect at the hands of their own biological parents or other caregivers are \nsubject to further abuse, neglect m1d  other rnaHreaiment and harmful conditions while in the \n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 34 of 57 - Page ID # 35\ncustody of the State.  This maltreatment occurs because ofHHS' failure to appropriately screen \nand oversee foster homes, segregate sexually reactive children (ollen themselves the victims of \nprior sexual abuse) or physically aggressive children from other foster children, and adequately \nmonitor and supervise visits between foster children and their biological family members when \nproblems that have not been addressed place children at risk of harm. \n109.  Through  the pattern  and practice of subjecting Plaintiffs to  placement \npractices that are emotionally, psychologically and even phy-sically injurious to them, Defendants \nhave acted and continue to act with deliberate indifference to their welfare and in clear departure \nfrom any reasonable exercise of professional judgment.  This pattem and practice of conduct has \ncaused, and is causing, direct and severe hann to Plaintiff children. \nHigh Caseloads, Turnover and Inadequate Training \nI J 0.  Defendants  routinely  fail  to  hire  and  retain  a  sufficient  number  of \ncaseworkers necessary to ensure Plaintiff children are provided the care and services to which \nthey are legally entitled. \n11 L  National standards provide that foster care caseworkers be responsible for \nno  more than  12 to  15  foster children.  HHS  caseworkers responsible  for Plaintiff children \nroutinely carry caseloads dangerously  in  excess  of those standards.  In some regions,  child \nwelfare caseworker caseloads are routinely several times the national stuudard and sometimes \nrequire caseworkers to be responsible for - and attempt to ensure the safety of  more than 50 \nPlaintiti children at one time. \n112.  High caseloads and a lack of support have led to a high caseworker and \nsupervisor attrition rate.  Especially in urban areas, caseworkers frequently leave after working \nfor HHS  for only one or two years, and many leave well before that time.  Among children \n-34-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 35 of 57 - Page ID # 36\nreviewed in the 2004 FCRB Report, nearly 60% had four or more caseworkers while in foster \ncare.  Frontline staff. who are charged with making critical decisions about a child including \nwhere  the  child  will  live,  are  frequently  youug  and  inexperienced  and,  as  a  result,  often \nunequipped to make decisions that comport with any reasonable professional judgment.  As a \nresult of high  attrition  in  the  supervisor  ranks,  supervisory staff responsible  for  overseeing \ncaseworkers are often themselves inexperienced, having been prematurely promoted to  cover \nvacant positions.  Supervisors are also often distracted from their supervisory duties by the need \nfor them to carry caseloads of foster children pending the replacement and training of departed \ncaseworkers. \n113.  The  high  turnover  rate  denies  Plaintiff children  the  appropriate  and \nconsistent services, stable placements and case planning that are essential to their safety and \nwell-being and to preventing them from languishing in state custody without permanent homes. \nEssential information about Plaintiff children and their cases  including such things as how well \nparticular children are adjusting to new foster homes, whether parent-child visits are helpful or \nharmful to particular children, or even what efforts !he biological parents have made towards \nreunification~ is lost because of caseworker turnover, attend;mt rebalancing of caseloads within \nHHS  units,  and  the  lack  of effective  communication  between  incoming  and  departing  or \notherwise transitioning workers. \n114.  These problems unduly prolong the time Plaintiff children stay in state \ncustody, as was recognized in a statewide \"self-assessment\" which HHS submitted to the federal \ngovernment in 2002 as patt of its federal audit, which listed caseworker turnover as one of the \nbarriers towards timely moving children towards adoption.  This self-assessment also identified \n-35-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 36 of 57 - Page ID # 37\ntumover and  high casel oads as  impacting HHS' ability  to complete case plans  m  a  timely \nfashion.  These deficiencies persist today. \n115.  Compounding the problems of turnover and high caseloads, the training \nprovided by HHS to child welfare caseworkers fails to adequately prepare the workers for the job \ncritical functions of overseeing the safety, well-being and permanency of Plaintiff children. \n116.  Through the pattern and practice of failing to hire, retain, train and support \nfront-line starT sufticient to meet the needs of Plaintiffs, Defendants have acted and continue to \nact  with deliberate indifference to  their welfare and  in clear departure from  any reasonable \nexercise  of professional judgment. This pattem and practice  of conduct has caused,  and is \ncausing, direct and severe harm to Plaintiff children. \nPoor Monitoring of Child Safetv \n117.  Defendants often fail to take basic screening precautions before Plaintiff \nchildren are placed in foster homes and other placements and fail to monitor Plaintiff children's \nsafety and well-being once in their placements. \n118.  HHS routinely fails to conduct documented assessments of the safety of a \nhome in which it has placed a foster child, or to consistently conduct criminal and child abuse \nbackground checks on the people it relies upon to care for foster children.  For example, the 2004 \nFCRB Report tound that in over 25% of the cases reviewed, children were placed in homes that \nwere unsafe, inappropriate, or had never undergone a documented safety assessment.  In 19% of \nthe cases reviewed by the Board, there was no clear indication that a complete assessment was \nconducted of the foster child's safety in the child's current placement. \n119.  HHS  also  fails  to  adequately  license  and  otherwise  oversee  private \nproviders with whom it  contracts tor the  provision of group and institutional  foster care to \n-36-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 37 of 57 - Page ID # 38\nPlaintiff children.  Licensing inspections of such facilities are typically performed only once \nevery other year, usually on an announced basis, and fail to identify staff and conditions that put \nPlaintiff children at risk of hann.  Such procedures are not in accord with national standards \nregarding the licensing of such facilities. \n120.  Compotmding the danger to children, HHS caseworkers responsible for \nPlaintiff children often fail to consistently visit the children assigned to them for long periods of \ntime, placing these children at serious risk ofha1m. \n121.  Regular visitation is essential to detennining, among other things, foster \nchildren's safety, their treatment and service needs, their progress in moving toward a permanent \nhome and the continued appropriateness of their current placements.  HHS itself has detennined \nthat foster care caseworkers are required to visit each of the children on their caseload every \nthirty days. \n122.  Nevertheless,  Plaintiff children  go  long  periods  without  seemg  their \ncaseworkers.  One of the findings made by the United States Department of Health and Human \nServices Administration for  Children and Families during a  2002  andit of Nebraska's child \nwelfare system was that \"the frequency and quality of fuce-to-face contact between caseworkers \nand the children and parents in their caseloads was often insufficient to monitor children's safety \nor promote attainment of case goals.\"  These deficiencies remain today.  For example, state data \nreports show that, for the month of March 2005, approximately 30% of foster children statewide \ndid not receive a required monthly conta\"\"1 from their caseworker.  In the Eastern Service Area \n(which includes Omaha), approximately 45% of children did not receive required monthly visits \nduring March 2005.  In the 2004 FCRB Report, the Board found that 526 foster children iu \"out· \n-37· \n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 38 of 57 - Page ID # 39\nof.home\" placement had no documentation in their case record to indicate that they had been \nseen by their caseworker even once in the previous 60 days. \n123.  Defendants inappropriately \"contract out\" essential casework duties such \nas monitoring visitation between Plaintiff children and their biological parents and conducting \nhome visits.  These vitally important caseworker tasks are not adequately monitored by HHS and \nthe actual supervision is often undenaken by cycling workers with minimal training and only \nlin1ited  knowledge of the children and parents whose visits they are  supervising.  Essential \ninformation about Plaintit1 children, such as how well particular children are adjusting to new \nfoster homes or whether parent-child visits are helpful or harmful to particular children, is often \nlost because the contract workers supervising visitation did not have the training to properly \nassess the situation or because of a lack of communication and coordination between and among \nthe foster care caseworker and the contract worker or workers. \n124.  In its 2004 Report, the Foster Care Review Board documented some of the \nproblems created by Defendants' reliance on substandard and unmonitored contract agents.  For \nexample, in some cases, ioster children were transported by a contract provider for supervised \nparent-child visits for weeks before the caseworker or the foster parents were informed that the \nparents were not even attending the visits.  At least one contract agency upon which Defendants \nrely to transport and supervise parent-child visits prohibited its employees from disclosing to \nHHS caseworkers any negative interactions that occurred dnring those visits. \n125.  Far too often private agency staff contracted to transport Plaintiff children \nto visitations fail to ensure that children are properly restrained in car seats, putting such children \nat risk of severe injury. \n-38-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 39 of 57 - Page ID # 40\n126.  Defendants continue the pattem and practice of failing to appropriately \nscreen foster homes and failing to supervise the Plaintiff children in their custody despite the risk \nit poses for and ham1 it inflicts upon the children they are charged with protecting.  Def(mdants' \nfailure to adequately monitor Plaintiff children is a departure from any reasonable exercise of \nprofessional judgment and is in deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs' safety and well-being.  This \npattem and pra.ctice of conduct has caused, and is causing, direct and severe harm to Plaintiff \nchildren. \nA Lack of Basic Health Services for Foster Children \n127.  Defendants often fail  to  ensure  that Plaintiff children in HI-IS  custody \nreceive adequate health care services, including mental health, medical and dental care. \n128.  Adequate health services are critical to ensuring that foster children do not \ndeteriorate while in state custody.  Health services are particularly important to foster children, as \nabused and neglected children who enter foster care frequently have more serious health care \nneeds, stemming from the circumstances that resulted in their placement into state custody and \nthe trauma of being removed from what is often the only home they have ever known. \n129.  For those Plaintiff children who need higher levels of medical and mental \nhealth services, Defendants have elected to contract with Magellan Health Services, a private \nbehavioral health organization, to provide intensive care management services.  Personnel from \nMagellan rarely, if ever, visit with children, typically making their determinations as to the needs \nof Plaintiff children solely on the basis of superficial paper reviews.  Magellan frequently denies \nrequests that foster children be provided higher-level treatment (and placement in the facilities in \nwhich such treatment can be provided) based on cost and without regard for diagnoses of need \nfor  such  treatment  and  placements.  Magellan  also  tenninates  mental  health  services  and \n-39-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 40 of 57 - Page ID # 41\nplacements prematurely based on cost and regardless of the child's actual continuing need.  HHS \nusually simply accepts such decisions by Magellan, and does not challenge them through the \nadministrative appeals process.  As  a result of the denial or premature termination of critical \nmental  health  services,  the  mental  health of Plaintiff children  further  deteriorates  and  their \nplacements disrupt more frequently,  decreasing the  likelihood that  the  children will ever be \nplaced in stable and permanent homes. \n130.  Plaintiff children, especially in the western and northern areas ofthe State, \nare regularly denied access to medical and mental health services in proximity to their homes, \noften because relevant service providers are located across state lines.  Plaintiff children are \neither denied any access to health professionals or are required to spend hours traveling across \nthe State to receive services, including regularly needed services such as weekly counseling. \n131.  In addition to receiving deficient mental health services, Nebraska foster \nchildren are often denied  required periodic medical and  dental  screening  examinations and \ntreatment.  Plaintiff children are also frequently denied timely and adequate dental care.  This is \ndue, at least in part, to a severe shortage of dental care providers willing to accept Medicaid in \nNebraska, coupled with Defendants' failure to make alternative funding arrangements for dental \nservices. \n132.  In addition to deticiencies in the delivery of health care services, CJitical \nmedical and mental health information about individual Plaintiff children is often not passed on \nto foster parents and oth.er caretakers, thereby placing the health of those children in jeopardy. \n133.  Defendants'  pattern  and  practice  of denying  Plaintiff children  needed \nmental health services and other medical and dental care subjects them to unnecessary harm and \ncontinued risk of harm, and amounts to a departure from any reasonable exercise of professional \n-40-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 41 of 57 - Page ID # 42\njudgment and deliberate indifference to Plain rifts'  health, safety and well-being.  This pattern \nand practice of conduct has caused, and is causing, direct and severe harm to Plaintiff children. \nPlanning and Services Inadequate to Move Children \nOut of Foster Care and Into Permanent Homes \n134.  Reasonable  professional judgment and  applicable  law  dictate  that  the \nplacement of a chi.ld in foster care must be temporary.  Foster children and their families must be \nprovided with planning and services necessary for the children to be promptly returned to the \ncustody of their parents or other caretakers, when it is safe to  do so.  When it is not safe or \nappropriate for children to be \"reunified\" with their own families, foster children must receive \nprompt efforts to find them an alternative permanent home, typically through adoption. \n135.  In Nebraska, foster children do not receive this mandated \"penuanency \nplanning\" and related services.  Instead, Plaintiff children are spending significant portions of \ntheir lives growing up in state custody.  In its 2002 review of the Nebraska foster care system, \nthe federal government identified HHS' failure to establish appropriate permanency goals and \nachieve adoptions in a timely mmmer as \"critical problems.\"  Because Defendants have failed to \naddress these problems, children continue to linger in state custody mmecessarily, at significant \ncost to their healtl1 and well-being. \n136.  Plaintiff children remain in foster care for unnecessarily long periods of \ntime because HHS fails to take even the most mdimentary steps to plan for how a child is to \nachieve a permanent home.  A child's case plan is key to a child achieving such penuanency, as \nit sets forth the plan for either reunifying the child with his or her biological parents or, when that \nis not possible, tbr moving the child to a safe and permanent alternative home, and designates the \nservices necessary for the child to attain that goal.  Despite the clear importance of case plans, \n-41-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 42 of 57 - Page ID # 43\nand the statutory obligation to create and implement them, HHS frequently fails to either prepare \nor implement case plans in an adequate or timely mal1ller. \n137.  The federal government, in its 2002 audit, expressed concem over HHS' \nmany failures in developing case plans and in involving parents in the case plarming process. \nThe failure to develop timely and adequate case plans remains a critical problem.  In its most \nrecent report, the Foster Care Review Board found that in 30% of the cases reviewed, the foster \nchild either had no current case plan, or the existing plan was incomplete.  The State's own data \nreflect that in the month of March 2005, more than 30% of the children in custody did not have a \ncurrent case plan.  And data submitted by HHS to the federal government in 2004 reflects that \n1,062 children (13.27%) in state custody had no established permanency goaL \n138.  In the absence of a permanency goal and case plan tor achieving that goal, \nPlaintiff children's stays in foster care are unnecessarily prolonged.  Often, biological parents do \nnot know or do not understand what they must do to secure their child's return home or are not \nprovided services necessmy for them to attain those goals.  In cases in which parents are not \nmaking efforts to be reunified with their children, there is often no documentation upon which to \nbuild a case for the termination of their parental rights, a required step before a child can be \nadopted. \n139.  In  those  cases  in  which  case plans  are  completed,  they  often contain \n\"boiler-plate\" language and are devoid of individualized assessments regarding the needs and \ncircumstances of children.  Thus,  HHS' policy is to initially assign a goal of return home to \nevery child who enters foster care, regardless of the child's family history.  Despite the heavy \nreliance on reunification as a permanency goal, critical services for biological parents, such as \n-42-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 43 of 57 - Page ID # 44\nsubstance  abuse  counseling,  often  are  not  available,  even  though  HI-IS  identified  them  as \nnecessary for the safe return of a child to his or her biological parents. \n140.  Caseworkers  fail  to  regularly  and  consistently  meet  with  biological \nparents, as they are required to do in order to assist and assess the parents' progress in achieving \nthe goal of reunification.  In March 2005, caseworkers of Plaintiff children made required visits \nwith the biological families of the children on their case load Jess than half of the time, and only a \nthird of the time in the Eastern Service Area.  HHS' failure to adequately and consistently work \nwith  biological  parents  toward reunification and  to  provide  access  to  services  to  assist  in \nreunillcation, often mmecessarily prolongs Plaintiff children's stays in foster care and deprives \nthem of family relationships and the opportunity to be retmified. \n141.  In many cases, HHS makes no  effort to have Plaintiff children's initial \ngoal of reunification changed to adoption (or in select cases, to another appropriate pern1anency \noption) until long after it is clear that a child will never be able to return home safely and well \nbeyond the statutory timeframes mandating that the child's goal be changed.  According to 2004 \nstatistics, only 9.87% of Nebraska's foster care population had a permanency goal of adoption, \nwhen the national rate is approximately 20%.  While children get older waiting for their goal to \nbe changed to  adoption, many develop behavioral problems associated with multiple moves, \nyears of uncertainty about their future, and other harms experienced while in foster care, and \nmany are no longer good candidates for adoption. \n142.  HHS also regularly recommends the return of Plaintiff children to their \nbiological families, often on trial reunifications, without ensuring their safety, withm1t having \nprovided needed services to such families, and without having assessed whether the problems \nthat led to the entry of such children into foster care have been addressed.  As a result, too many \n-43-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 44 of 57 - Page ID # 45\nPlaintiff children who are reunified  with their biological families return to  foster care after \nexperiencing further maltreatment.  For example, the FCRB 2004 Report indicates that just under \n40% of the foster children who were in \"out-of~home\" care at the end 2003 had returned to State \ncustody due to abuse or neglect after one or more failed reunification attempts. \n143.  HHS  routinely  recommends  that  Plaintiff  children  attend  biological \nparent-child visits even when such visits are clearly emotionally injurious to a child because the \nparent's attendance at the visits is en·atie, or because the parent fails to engage with the child in \nan appropriate manner.  Too often HHS caseworkers arc unaware of what transpires at these \nvisits hecause the supervision of the visits has been contracted out to private agency workers, and \ncritical information is not passed on to the HHS workers with principal responsibility for the \ncase. \n144.  In those cases in which it is determined that reunification is no longer an \nappropriate goal for a Plaintiff child, HHS frequently fails to begin the process necessary to \npermit tennination of the parental rights  of the biological parents in accordance with federal \nstatutory timeframes.  In its review of Nebraska's child welfare system, the federal govemment \nnoted as a \"key concern\" that the State was failing to free children for adoption in accordance \nwith the time frames established by federal law.  Nebraska stakeholders involved with the federal \nreview noted that it was \"rare\" for HHS to seek to free a child for adoption.  This deficiency \ncontinues today. \n145.  Even on those occasions when HHS decides to free a Plaintiff child for \nadoption, the process is often unnecessarily prolonged because HHS first seeks to terminate the \nrights of the biological mother.  Only after that is accomplished does HHS begin the process of \nterminating the rights of the father.  In many instances, it is only when HHS is prepaling to \n-44-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 45 of 57 - Page ID # 46\nterminate the rights of a biological mother that HHS begins the search for missing biological \nfathers.  If the :futher is located, HHS may start the lengthy process of attempting to reunify the \nfoster child and missing father. regardless of how long the child has been in foster care.  Only \nafter this process has been exhausted does HHS seek to move a child to adoption. \n146.  By failing to locate and involve missing :futhers at fhe outset of a case, and \nby later not  seeking  to  terminate  the  rights  of both  parents  simultaneously,  months,  and \nfrequently years go  by,  during which time opportunities for a permanent home are lost and \nPlaintiff children are left in limbo, not knowing if they will ever find a permanent home. \n147.  HHS also regularly fails to identify in a timely fashion relatives who are \nwilling and able to provide appropriate care for Plaintiff children at the time they enter the foster \ncare system.  Instead, HHS fi'equently waits UJltil a child has been in the foster care system for \nmonths and sometimes years before it looks to identify relatives who may be available to care for \ntheir kin in foster care.  In some instances a search for relatives does not even begin until tl1e \nchild has been in custody so long that he or she .is in the process of being freed for adoption.  If a. \nrelative is located for a child at that late juncture, HHS often removes the child from a foster \nhome and places the child with the relative, regardless of how long the child has lived in the \nfoster home or if the foster parents are ready, willing and able to adopt the child, and irrespective \nof whether the child has ever had any contact with the relative prior to entering foster care.  The \nfrequent practice of uprooting children from stable foster families that have bonded with and are \nwilling to adopt particular children and placing those children into the homes of relatives who \nare virtual strangers to them, is often psychologically damaging. \n148.  In those cases in which HHS seeks to change a child's goal to adoption \nand the child's parental rights are tenninated in order for the child to be adopted, it takes well \n-45-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 46 of 57 - Page ID # 47\nover three years, on average, from the child's entry into care for an adoption to be finalized, an \nenom1ous portion of any child's life.  In fiscal year 2004, only 15% of those children who exited \nfoster care to a finalized adoption did so within 24 months of coming into foster care.  The \nnational standard on this measure is 32%. more than double HHS' performance on this critical \nbenchmark. \n149.  The  routine  delays  in  accomplishing  adoptions  of foster  children  in \nNebraska are hannful and unnecessary because, as the federal government noted in its audit of \nNebraska's foster care system, they are principally attributable to ineffective casework practice, \nrather than any external faelors.  Poor casework includes the unnecessary delays described above \nand the failure to transfer cases in a timely manner to th.e adoption unit responsible for placing \nchildren in permanent homes (in the few areas that have such specialized adoption units) or to \nprivate agencies with whom HHS contracts for adoption services, and the failure to Jist children \navailable for adoption on either the state or national adoption exchanges that allow prospective \nadoptive parents to identify children whom tl1ey might be interested in adopting.  Although, in \nSeptember 2004, HHS reported to the federal govcnunent that there were over 700 children in \nstate custody with the goal of adoption, as of March 2005 only 161  were residing in what HHS \nidentified as pre-adoptive homes.  Though there are many hundreds of children with the goal of \nadoption for whom HHS has not identified an adoptive home, as of September 2005, only 45 \nfoster children were listed on the State's public adoption exchange website. \n150.  There are a number of Plaintiti children in foster care for whom Nebraska \nsimply has given up trying to find a permanent home.  In 2004, the State repmted that over 130 \nfoster  children had a  pe1manency  goal  of \"long term  foster  care\"  and 488  had a  goal  of \n\"emancipation from foster care.\"  This means that HHS has no plan for these children other than \n-46-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 47 of 57 - Page ID # 48\nthat they will grow up in foster care and, at or around age 19, be left to fend for themselves \nwithout ever having had the opportunity to  grow up in a permanent and  loving home.  Of \nparticular concern is HHS' inappropriate practice of attaching goals such as \"long tenn foster \ncare\" even to very yo1mg children m1der six years old. \n151.  Plaintiff children are also  frequently denied relationships with siblings. \nChildren who enter State custody with siblings are often separated from them and placed in \ndifferent foster homes.  HHS also routinely fails to ensure d1at foster children who are separated \nfrom their siblings have regular opportunities to visit them.  As a result, HHS interferes with and \ndamages these critical tamily relationships. \n152.  Defendants are legally obligated to provide independent living services to \nthose foster youth ages 16 and older who cannot be returned home or adopted in order to prepare \nthem to live on their own upon discharge from foster care.  HHS has failed to adequately develop \nor make accessible an adequate array of such independent living services.  As a result, every year \nPlaintiff children are emancipated from the foster care system without the life skiils necessary to \nfunction in society.  Many of these foster care \"graduates\" go  on to enter the ranks  of the \nunemployed, the incarcerated and the homeless. \n153.  Defendants' pattem and practice of allowing children to languish for long \nperiods of time in foster care, failing to provide adequate planning and services for children's \nplacement into petmanent homes, separating foster children from their siblings and denying them \nopportunities to maintain family relationships, and failing to provide adequate services to allow \nchildren  to  live  independently  when  d1ey  are  discharged  from  state  custody,  despite  d1e \nknowledge that such practices subject children to psychological harm and make them more likely \nto develop behavioral problems, is in deliberate indifference to Plaintiff children's welfare, and \n-47-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 48 of 57 - Page ID # 49\nis well outside the bounds of any reasonable exercise of professional judgment.  This pattern and \npractice of conduct has caused, and is causing, direct and severe harm to Plaintiff children. \nFiscal Waste \n154.  Nebraska  regularly  fails  to  collect  available  federal  funds  for  toster \nchildren in State custody, foregoing millions of dollars that could be used to provide desperately \nneeded homes and services for Plaintiff children. \n155.  Nebraska  has  entered  into  a  State  Plan  contract  with  the  federal \ngovernment pursuant to Title IV -E of the Social Security Act, under which the State is entitled to \nreceive certain  federal  monies  in  exchange  for  the  State's compliance with various  federal \nrequirements pertaining to foster care and adoption assistance.  Yet Nebraska routinely fails to \ncollect available federal  funds for the care of foster children and, in fact, collects Title IV-E \nfederal funds for only between 20 and 30% of the foster children in \"out-of-home\" care in the \nState, about half the national average. \n156.  HHS  also  fails  to  spend  all  of the  momes  appropriated to  it by the \nlegislature for maintenance of the State's child welfare system. \n!57.  Defendants' pattern and practice of failure to obtain and expend available \nmonies on behalf of Plaintiff children in desperate need of appropriate placements and services is \ninconsistent with the reasonable exercise of professional judgment and in deliberate indifference \nto Plaintiffs'  safety and well-being.  This pattern and practice of conduct has caused, and is \ncausing, direct and severe harm to Plaintiff children. \nPoor Information Management Systems \n158.  Defendants have failed to develop an intbrmationmanagement system that \nis capable of meeting the needs of HHS caseworkers and the Plaintiff children they serve.  The \n-48-\n\n4:05-cv-03241-RGK-DLP   Doc # 1   Filed: 09/19/05   Page 49 of 57 - Page ID # 50\ndata in  the State's primary child welfare database, N-FOCUS, .is  often outdated or incorrect, \nimpeding  the  ability  of caseworkers,  supervisors  and management  staff to  make  infom1ed \ndecisions for Plaintiff children. \nBreach of State Plan Contracts \n159.  The  federal  government  has  approved  the  State  Plans  submitted  by \nNebraska in order to receive tederal financial assistance under Titles IV-B and lV-E of the Social \nSecurity Act to help fund the State's child welfare, foster care and adoption programs.  These \nState Plans are contract~ into which the St<tte of Nebraska enters for the express and direct \nbenefit of Plaintiff children, who are third-party beneficiaries of these contracts.  Defendants are \ndirectly responsible for fulfilling the obligations undertaken by Nebraska when it entered into \nthese State Plan contracts, including but not limited to the obligation to administer the programs \nin accordance with specific relevant state statutes, regulations, policies and all applicable federal \nstatutes, regulations and other official issuances of the United States Department of Health and \nHuman Services. \n160.  Defendants have breached their obligations to Plaintiffs under these State \nPlan contracts. \nCAUSES OF ACTION BROUGHT Pl!RSUA.\"'T TO 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nFirst Cause of Action- Substantive Due Process \n161.
