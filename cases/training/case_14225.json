    "summary": "<p>On February 25, 1986, fifteen foster children filed this case as a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. They proceeded under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Governor of Louisiana and various state officials with responsibility for administering the state's child welfare system. The Plaintiffs, represented by the Children's Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union (now Children's Rights, Inc.) and private counsel, sought money damages and declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that Defendants were violating Plaintiffs' substantive and procedural due process rights under the United States Constitution; Plaintiffs' rights under the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (AACWA); and Plaintiffs' rights under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) in their administration of Louisiana's child welfare system. On April 28, 1986, Plaintiffs amended their complaint to add additional named Plaintiffs.</p><p>On March 2, 1988, the District Court (Judge Morey L. Sear) denied certain individual Defendants' motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment. Defendants had sought to dismiss the complaint on the basis of qualified immunity, and argued that both plaintiffs' statutory and constitutional rights were not \"clearly established\" at the time of the alleged violations. The Court held that both plaintiffs' statutory and constitutional rights were indeed \"clearly established\"; however, he noted that the parties agreed that defendants may not be held liable for damages in their official capacities under the Eleventh Amendment, and could not be held liable for damages in their individual capacities for events occurring prior to the defendant officials' respective assumptions of office. The Court also noted that it was \"implicit\" that \"all of the claims that may give rise to damages may also support declaratory and injunctive relief.\" The Court concluded that plaintiffs have proffered \"sufficient evidence to indicate that there are significant numbers of violations,\" and to allow the case to proceed. Del A. v. Edwards, No. 86-0801, 1988 WL 19284 (E.D. La. Mar. 2, 1988). The Defendants filed an interlocutory appeal, which was allowed because denials of claims of qualified immunity are appealable.</p><p>On September 28, 1988, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the District Court's denial of summary judgment. The Fifth Circuit (Circuit Judge William H. Thornberry) held that Plaintiffs' claims under the AACWA were \"clearly established\" at the time of the alleged violations; however, the appellate court declined to address whether Plaintiffs' constitutional claims were clearly established. The Court noted that, as further litigation was necessary on the statutory claims, deciding a constitutional question was unnecessary at that time, and may be obviated depending on the District Court's ultimate ruling. Circuit Judge Jerry E. Smith dissented, stating his belief that Plaintiffs' claims merited dismissal. Judge Smith stated that, by avoiding the question of whether Plaintiffs' constitutional claims were clearly established, the majority allowed \"a single dubious claim to frustrate [D]efendants' right, under the doctrine of qualified immunity, to avoid having to face a jury and answer, in damages, novel claims of unestablished constitutional 'rights.'\" Del A. v. Edwards, 855 F.2d 1148 (5th Cir. 1988). </p><p>On December 19, 1988, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted Defendants' petition for rehearing en banc. Del A. v. Edwards, 862 F.2d 1107 (5th Cir. 1988). On January 13, 1989, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their damages claims with prejudice. On February 28, 1989, the Fifth Circuit dismissed the appeal. Del A. v. Edwards, 867 F.2d 842 (5th Cir. 1988).</p><p>Also on December 19, 1988, the District Court (Judge Sear) denied Governor Edwin Edward's motion to dismiss. The nub of the motion was that the Plaintiffs had failed to show \"links in the chain of proximate cause linking specific acts of the governor to the allegations in the complaint.\" The Court concluded that the governor, charged with lawful administration of the child welfare system, was a \"supervisory official,\" and that such an official could still be entitled to qualified immunity unless the plaintiff were to put forth evidence indicating the official \"in fact failed to act.\" In concluding that the Plaintiffs here had \"not yet done\" this, the Court permitted Plaintiffs fourteen days to furnish evidence of failure to act, after which time the Court would enter summary judgment for the governor. Del A. v. Edwards, No. 86-801, 1988 WL 137494 (E.D. La. Dec. 19, 1988). It is unclear whether summary judgment was subsequently entered for Governor Edward.</p><p>On March 6, 1989, trial began. By this point, nine Named Plaintiffs had been dismissed on mootness grounds; apparently, Plaintiffs' motion for class certification had either been denied or was never entertained. After two days of trial, the Court (Judge Sear) expressed his belief that plaintiffs had established prima facie violations of law. The Court encouraged the parties' respective child welfare experts to develop a plan to improve the Louisiana child welfare system. The parties agreed, and Defendants agreed the plan would apply class-wide (despite the absence of a certified class). Trial was continued indefinitely.</p><p>On August 18, 1989, the experts (without the assistance of counsel) provided a draft improvement plan to the Court. The Court (Judge Sear) ordered the parties to show cause why the plan should not be adopted. Following this hearing, the Court and the experts further revised the plan. After a final status conference, the parties were unable to reach agreement on a number of issues; the Court resolved the differences itself and adopted the plan. Del A. v. Edwards, No. 86-0801, 1990 WL 6035 (E.D. La. Jan. 25, 1990). </p><p>Following the adoption of the plan, each side moved to amend it. The Defendants wished to have language removed which stated that they did not object to the plan; the Plaintiffs sought some mechanism of enforcing compliance with the plan through the Court's contempt power. On March 22, 1990, the Court (Judge Sear) vacated the plan and returned the case to the trial calendar, stating that it was \"obvious\" that the plan did not provide \"a mutually satisfactory resolution to the alleged problems\" in Louisiana's child welfare system.</p><p>In May and July 1990, the Plaintiffs amended their complaint to again add new Named Plaintiffs. </p><p>Trial began for the second time on November 19, 1990 and concluded sometime early in 1991.</p><p>On October 21, 1991, the District Court (Judge Sear) entered judgment for Defendants on all counts. The Court held that Plaintiffs were not entitled to relief under AACWA because the Act did not create a right enforceable under Section 1983, nor an implied private right of action; that Plaintiffs were not entitled to relief under CAPTA because there was no enforceable right; that, even if private rights of action existed, Louisiana did not violate the Acts; that Plaintiffs had \"no clearly established right\" under the Fourteenth Amendment to a stable foster home environment; that Plaintiffs had \"no liberty interest in emotional well-being\"; that Plaintiffs had \"no right to be placed in the least restrictive foster care arrangement\"; and that Plaintiffs had a protected property interest with respect to their procedural due process claim, but that Plaintiffs failed to allege what procedural requirement was not complied with. Del A. v. Roemer, 777 F. Supp. 1297 (E.D. La. 1991). </p><p>On November 5, 1991, Plaintiffs appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. However, on December 7, 1992, Plaintiffs withdrew their appeal. Presumably, this withdrawal was in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=11170\">Suter v. Artist M., 503 U.S. 347 (1992)</a>, decided earlier that year, which held that AACWA did not create or imply a private right of action.</p>",

On January 25, 1990, the District Court (Judge Morey L. Sear), in conjunction with the parties' child welfare experts, entered an improvement plan aimed at curing systemic deficiencies in the Louisiana child welfare system. However, following objections of the parties, the Court vacated the plan and held a trial on the Plaintiffs' claims. On October 21, 1991, the Court entered judgment for Defendants on all counts.",

Edwards, 855 F.2d 1148 (1988)   \n \n \n2  This appeal arises from the denial of a motion to dismiss the complaint or alternatively for summary judgment. Although normally \nthis disposition would require us to examine affidavits and other summary judgment evidence, we need not do so in this case. It is \n \nclear from the parties’ briefs on appeal and from the proceedings at trial that the parties are challenging only the legal sufficiency \nof the complaint. The parties both referred throughout this appeal to the allegations in the complaint. Moreover, the defendants \nstated in their “Supplemental Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss and/or Motion for Summary Judgment” that “[t]he \nthrust of defendants’ motion is that the children’s allegations, accepting them as true, fail to state a claim” or alternatively should \nbe “dismissed under the doctrine of qualified immunity.” In their appellate briefs, appellants have failed to point to any specific \nfactual insufficiency in the summary judgment evidence. Therefore, we will confine our review to the sufficiency of the allegations \nin the complaint. \n \n1  The Second Circuit has developed a generalized rule for these circumstances. Under its doctrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction, \nthe court first determines whether it has jurisdiction over an appeal of any of the issues raised. Once the appellate court has \n \nrecognized jurisdiction over the case, it may exercise its discretion to consider otherwise nonappealable issues that sufficiently \noverlap the appealable issues.  San Filippo, 737 F.2d at 255 (citing cases). \n \n2  I recognize that under Wright, private actions to enforce individual rights under funding statutes may become more prevalent. \nNonetheless, I quote this language from Pennhurst to emphasize that spending clause statutes primarily calibrate the relationships \n \nbetween the federal government and the entities with which it does business. Such statutes affect individual rights only to the \nextent of the conditions the statutes impose upon the relationship between the federal government and the funded entity. \n \n3  See Guardians, 463 U.S. at 603-04, 103 S.Ct. at 3233 (White, J.) (analogizing, for the purposes of determining available relief, \nspending clause cases to eleventh amendment immunity cases). Cf. Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 105 S.Ct. \n \n3142, 87 L.Ed.2d 171 (1985) (state’s consent to abide by spending statute obligations is not consent enough to waive eleventh \namendment  sovereign  immunity).  See  also  Fletcher,  A  Historical  Interpretation  of  the  Eleventh  Amendment:  A  Narrow \nConstruction of an Affirmative Grant of Jurisdiction Rather than a Prohibition Against Jurisdiction, 35 Stan.L.Rev. 1033, 1124-27 \n(1983) (suggesting that the Supreme Court, cognizant of the limits of federal power over the states, is reluctant, in a case based \nupon the spending clause, to hold that a state has waived eleventh amendment immunity). \n \n4  South Dakota v.

Edwards, Not Reported in F.Supp. (1990)   \n1990 WL 6035 \n \n5  Del A, Brendolyn A, and Flemming G. \n \n \n6  Plaintiffs designated Dr. Jeanne M. Hunzeker, Associate Dean of the School of Social Work, Southern University at New Orleans, \nas their expert. Defendants designated Brenda Kelley, Assistant Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Social Services, as their \n \nexpert. \n \n7  P.L. 96–272 amended the federal Child welfare Services program and established a federal Foster Care and Adoption Assistance \nprogram. These programs are set forth, respectively, in Title IV–B (42 U.S.C. §§ 620–28) and IV–E (42 U.S.C. §§ 670–76) of the \n \nSocial Security Act. \nTitle IV–B provides funds to develop preventive and reunification services and to improve planning and case review for foster \nchildren and their parents. In order to receive additional federal funds under Title IV–B, a state must have a child welfare system \nwhich assures for all children in state supervised care, including case plans for each child, periodic case reviews, an inventory, \nan information system, and a service program to reunite children with their families. See42 U.S.C. §§ 620–28; Allen, Golubock, \n& Olson, A Guide to the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, in Foster Children in the Courts 579 (M. Hardin \ned. 1983) [hereinafter Foster Children in the Courts ]. \nTitle IV–E provides funds for the maintenance of children in foster care or in adoptive families. Title IV–E also provides \nreimbursement funds for children placed in foster care. In order to receive funds under Title IV–E, a state must have a plan \nwhich meets the requirements of Title IV–E as set forth in 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a) and 675. Among other things, the plan must \nprovide for individual case plans and periodic case reviews for children in foster care, and must provide that reasonable efforts \nwill be made in each case a) to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from his home prior to placement in foster \ncare, and b) to make it possible for the child to return to his home. See42 U.S.C. §§ 670–76; Foster Children in the Courts 579–\n80. \n \n8  See Plaintiffs’ Response to Order to Show Cause dated November 6, 1989. \n \n \n9  Plaintiffs also requested the following modifications: 1) section IV(B) of the Plan (Child Specific, Family Focused Programming) \nshould specifically refer to the State’s Foster Care Program Policy Manual, sections 6–510 through 6–545 (dealing with \n \nrequirements for children in foster care, including case plans); 2) the Plan should, in addition to ensuring that the State make \nreasonable efforts to return children to their homes (section IV(C)), ensure that the State make reasonable efforts to prevent \nplacement of children in foster care; and 3) the Plan should provide for appropriate medical care to children in foster care. \nBecause 96–272 contains specific requirements with respect to children in foster care, see42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1), \n(5)(B), (6); 45 C.F.R. § 1356.21(d)(2), and because the Plan is to be implemented in accordance with these requirements, I see \nno need to discuss plaintiffs’ objections as to requirements for children in foster care. Further, as the Plan does require that the \nState make reasonable efforts to prevent placement of children in foster care (section I(A)(2)) and that children in foster care will \nreceive adequate medical care (section I(B)(7)), I confine myself to a discussion of the objections concerning caseload limits, \ntimelines, and case worker training. \n \n10  On several occasions during the revision process, plaintiffs argued that the State’s own policy manuals attest to the validity of \nplaintiffs’ objections. See, e.g., Plaintiff’s Response to Order to Show Cause at 9–12. Plaintiffs do not specifically contend in their \n \nobjections that these policy manuals create property interests to which plaintiffs have a legitimate claim of entitlement, but the \nargument nonetheless has the flavor of a procedural due process claim as recognized in Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 \nS.Ct. 2701 (1972). Even if the policy manuals do create property interests to which plaintiffs have a legitimate claim of \nentitlement, see Taylor v. Ledbetter, 818 F.2d 791, 798–800 (11th Cir.1987), cert. denied,109 S.Ct. 1337 (1989), I cannot order \ndefendants to provide the benefits available under state law.  Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 106, 104 S.Ct. at 911. Rather, I can only order \ndefendants to provide procedural protection of these benefits to ensure that the benefits are not denied without due process of law. \nSee Taylor, 818 F.2d at 822 (Tjoflat, J., dissenting). \n \n11  Section I(A)(1) (Child Protective Services) provides, in relevant part: \nNational child welfare standards adopted in 1988 indicate workers in child protective services should carry no more than 10 to \n \n12 new cases per month and should not exceed a combined caseload of 16 new and ongoing cases per month. \nSection I(A)(2) (Family Based Services) provides, in relevant part: \nNational child welfare standards suggest staff should be well-trained child welfare practitioners (Bachelor’s degrees and Master \nof Social Work degrees) with a case load of 18 to 20 families in a one month period and carry the family for 3 to 6 months of \nservice. \nSection I(B)(4) (Foster Family Care) provides, in relevant part: \nFoster family care workers will be assigned workloads that reflect a differentiated caseload which reflects the individual needs \nof the children served. Workers with children placed in regular foster families will be assigned no more than 20 to 25 children \nand their families and whatever number of foster homes that entails. Workers with children with special needs will be assigned \nno more than 15 to 20 children, their families and whatever number of specialized foster families that entails. \n  13 \n \n\nDel A v. Edwards, Not Reported in F.Supp. (1990)   \n1990 WL 6035 \n \nSection I(C) (Permanent Substitute Services: Adoption) provides, in relevant part: \nNational child welfare standards of practice indicate adoption workloads should be specialized as follows: staff working with \nyounger children under 8 years of age should have no more than 20 active cases and workers with older special needs children \nshould carry no more than 10 to 12 active cases. \n \n12  42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(15). \n \n \n13  See42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(15)(A).

I do not feel \n \nconstrained however by this holding because the court arrived at this conclusion without discussion. \n \n33  42 U.S.C. § 627(a)(2)(A). \n \n \n34  496 U.S. 498, 110 S.Ct. 2510, 2516–17, 110 L.Ed.2d 455 (1990). \n \n \n35  479 U.S. 418, 430, 107 S.Ct. 766, 774, 93 L.Ed.2d 781 (1987). \n \n \n36  Part E funds also support foster care maintenance payments and adoption assistance payments. 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(1). The \npayments are made to the individuals or institutions caring for the child. Id. § 675(3)–(4). This aspect of the Part E funding \n \nprovision parallels the provision addressed in Wilder v. Virginia Hosp. Ass’n, 496 U.S. 498, 110 S.Ct. 2510, 110 L.Ed.2d 455 \n(1990). Both provisions require the state to disburse the funds directly to the putative plaintiff, or in the case of the children, to an \nindividual or entity on behalf of the child. In light of the Wilder Court’s holding that the funding statute benefits the putative \nplaintiff, the Part E provisions pertaining to these payments probably benefits the putative plaintiffs. Yet, in Wilder the putative \nplaintiff expressly challenged the amount of funds it had received from the state. The children have not alleged a violation of any \nprovision relating to these payments. Accordingly, the payment provisions are not at issue and the Wilder holding does not apply. \n \n37  42 U.S.C. §§ 627(b), 671(b). \n \n \n38  451 U.S. 1, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981). \n \n \n39  Id. at 24, 101 S.Ct. at 1543. \n \n \n40  See Spielman v.
