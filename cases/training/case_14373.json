    "summary": "<p>On August 19, 2013, Priests for Life, a non-profit Catholic group organized in opposition to abortion, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). Represented by the American Freedom Law Center, the plaintiffs asked the court for monetary relief and to enjoin the contraceptive services mandate in the Affordable Care Act. The plaintiffs claimed that the contraceptive services mandate was unconstitutional and violated the plaintiffs' rights to freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of expressive association, and equal treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that their sincerely held religious beliefs cause them to object to providing any direct or indirect support for contraception, sterilization, or abortifacients. They claimed that the accommodation for non-profit religious employers allowing them to have nothing to do with the contraceptive services provided by a third party insurer did not assuage their concerns. They claimed that even though the entire cost of the services would be absorbed by the third party, they would be furthering these services by paying for coverage through an insurer that provided these services.</p>\r\n<p>This case involves the same dispute as <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12690\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Priests for Life v. Sebelius</a> in the Southern District of New York, which was dismissed without prejudice on April 15, 2013, and was refiled in the District of Columbia later in the year. Priests for Life is one of a number of organizations that is religiously based and has a particular objection to the contraception mandate, but is not covered under any of the religious exemptions in the statute or in regulation, which are generally limited to churches and religious orders. Priests for Life objects to the fact that a health care plan that they purchase for their employees will provide those employees with access to contraceptive services.</p>\r\n<p>On December 19, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a judgment for the defendant. The court found that the actions of third parties do no create an impermissible burden, and granted the defendants' motion to dismiss.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs appealed this case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on December 19, 2013. 7 F. Supp. 3d 88 (D.D.C. 2013). The appeal included the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The Appeals Court ruled on November 14, 2014 that the accommodation the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has designed for religious nonprofits to comply with the contraceptive coverage mandate does not burden the plaintiffs' religious freedom, and affirmed the District Court's ruling. 772 F.3d 229 (D.C. Cir. 2014). On May 20, 2015, the Court of Appeals denied plaintiffs request for rehearing en banc, reasoning that the result in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12661\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius</a> does not compel them to credit plaintiffs&rsquo; misinterpretation of the regulation the plaintiffs are challenging and on June 10, 2015, the Circuit Court ordered that the mandate be stayed through August 26, 2015, pending petition for writ of certiorari.</p>\r\n<p>On November 6, 2015, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in this case to decide whether notifying the federal government by signing a form identifying the employer as a religious nonprofit that objects to the contraceptive services mandate (so that the government can work with the insurer or benefits provider to ensure employees have contraceptive coverage) violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or constitutes the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling government interest. This case was consolidated with six other cases dealing with this issue. Together, the cases were known as <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13465\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zubik v. Burwell [II] </a>.</p>\r\n<p>This case was argued on March 23, 2016. On March 29, 2016, in an unusual move, the Supreme Court directed the parties to file supplemental briefs suggesting a solution to their disagreement, in which employees could still receive contraception coverage without employers giving any notice to the government. On May 16, 2016, the Court issued a per curiam order remanding all seven cases to their respective courts of appeals, ordering the lower courts to give the parties time to come to agreement on an approach that that \"accommodates petitioners&rsquo; religious exercise while at the same time ensuring that women covered by petitioners&rsquo; health plans 'receive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage.'\" 578 U.S. 403. The Court took no position on the merits of this case.</p>\r\n<p>Back in the Circuit Court, the parties submitted a series of status reports indicating they had entered into settlement negotiations with the new Trump administration. On Oct. 16, 2017, the parties filed a joint motion to voluntarily dismiss the appeal. The case appears to be settled, though any settlement agreement is not currently publicly available. The Circuit Court dismissed the case on Nov. 6, 2017.</p>\r\n<p>The case is now closed.</p>",

This is a civil action in which Plaintiffs are seeking to protect and defend religious \nfreedom.  Plaintiffs are challenging the im plementing regulations of the  Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act (“Affordable Care Act”) which require ce rtain em ployers, includin g \nPlaintiff Priests for Life, to provid e insurance  plans that include cov erage for, or access to,  \ncontraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and related education and counseling (hereinafter also \nreferred to as “contraceptive services mandate”).   \n2.  Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the  contraceptive serv ices m andate violates \nfederal constitutional and statutory law and a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining its \nenforcement.  Indeed, the contraceptive serv ices mandate is unconstitutional on its face and as \napplied in that it violates Plaintiffs’ rights to the free exercise of religion, the freedom of speech, \nand expressive association under the First Am endment; it violates the Establishm ent Clause of \nthe First Amendment; it deprives Plaintiffs of the equal protection of the law guaranteed by the \nFifth Amendment; and it violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n3.  This action in which the United States is a defendant arises under the Constitution \nand laws of the United States.   Jurisdiction is conferred on this C ourt pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331 and 1346.    \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 3 of 33\n4.  Plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201 and 2202, by Rules 57 and 65 of the Fe deral Rules of Civil Procedure, by 28 U.S.C. § \n2000bb-1, and by the general legal and equitable powers of this Court.   \n5.  Venue is p roper in th is district pur suant to  28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because \nDefendants reside in this district and a substantial part of the acts giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims \noccurred in this district. \nPARTIES \n6.  Plaintiff Priests for L ife is a nonprofit corp oration that is inco rporated under the \nlaws of the State of New York.  It is recogn ized by the Internal Reven ue Service as a Section \n501(c)(3) organization.  Priests fo r Life is a religious organizat ion.  And based  on its sincerely \nheld religious beliefs, Priests for Life objects  to providing—directly or indirectly—any support \nfor, or access to, contraception, sterilization, and abortifacients.   \n7.  Plaintiff Father Frank Pavone  is an ordained, Rom an Catholic priest and the \nNational Director of Pr iests for Life.  Through  Priests for Life and those who associate with \nPriests for Life for the purpos e of advancing and prom oting its religious m ission, Fr. Pavone \nexercises his fundam ental constitutional rights to  the free exercise of  religion, the freedom  of \nspeech, and expressive association.  Fr. Pavone objects to D efendants forcing Priests for Life to \nprovide—directly or indi rectly—any support for, or access t o, contraception, sterilization, and \nabortifacients based on his sincerely held religious beliefs.  Fr. Pavone is currently covered under \nPriests for Life’s health care plan. \n8.  Plaintiff Alveda King, the niece of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., is a \nfull-time employee of Priests for Life.  She is cu rrently the Pastoral Associate and Director of \nAfrican-American Outreach for P riests for Life and  Gospel of Life Minis tries.  She is  also a \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 4 of 33\nvoice for the Silent No More Awareness Cam paign, which is the world’s largest mobilization of \nwomen and m en who have lost children to ab ortion, sharing her testimony of two abortions , \nGod’s forgiveness, and healing.  Through Priests  for Life and those who associate with Priests \nfor Life for the purpose of advancing and pr omoting its religious m ission, Plaintiff King  \nexercises her fundam ental constitutional rights to the free exerci se of religion, the freedom  of \nspeech, and expressive association.  Plaintiff King objects to Defendants forcing Priests for Life \nto provide—directly or indirectly—any support for, or access to, contraception, sterilization, and \nabortifacients based on her sincerely held religious beliefs. \n9.  Plaintiff King is currently covered under Priests for Life’s health care plan, which \nis an “employer-sponsored” plan under the Affordable Care Act.  If Priests for Life were forced \nout of the health care market,  Plaintiff King, as well as m any other Priests for Life em ployees, \nincluding Plaintiff Morana, would be forced to  purchase a costly, individual insurance plan as a \nresult of the “individual m andate” provision of the Act.  This indi vidual health care plan will \nnecessarily include “contraceptive services” coverage because the mandate applies to individual \nplans.   \n10.  Plaintiff Janet Morana is a full-time employee of Priests for Life.  She is currently \nthe Executive Director of Priests for Life, and she is the Co-Founder of the Silent No More \nAwareness Campaign.  Through Priests for Life and those who associate with Priests for Life for \nthe purpose of advancing and promoting its relig ious mission, Plaintiff Morana exercises her \nfundamental constitutional rights to the free ex ercise of religion, the freedom  of speech, and \nexpressive association.  Plai ntiff Morana objects to Defendant s forci ng Pri ests for Li fe t o \nprovide—directly or indi rectly—any support for, or access t o, contraception, sterilization, and \nabortifacients based on her sincerely held religious beliefs.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 5 of 33\n11.  Plaintiff Morana is covered  under Priests for Life’s health  care plan, which is an \n“employer-sponsored” plan under the Affordable Care Act.  If Priests for Life were forced out of \nthe health care m arket, Plaintiff Morana woul d be forced to purchase a costly, individual \ninsurance plan as a res ult of  the “individual mandate” provision  of the Act.  This individual \nhealth care plan will necessarily include the immoral “contraceptive services” coverage because \nthe mandate applies to individual plans.   \n12.

In March 2010, President Obam a signed  into law the P atient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act, Pub.  L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010),  amended by Healthcare and \nEducation Reconciliation Act of 2010, Pub. L.  No. 111-152, 124 Stat. 1029  (2010) (hereinafter \n“Affordable Care Act” or “Act”). \n19.  The Affordable Care Act requires em ployers with 50 or m ore e mployees to \nprovide federal governm ent-approved health insura nce or pay a substantial per-employee fine \n(“corporate mandate”).  26 U.S.C. § 4980H.  Th e implementation of the “corporate m andate,” \nwhich was required to take effect on January 1, 2014, has been delayed until 2015 by the Obama \nadministration without congressional approval.  \n20.  The Affordable Care Act also requires, inter alia, each “applicable individual” to \npurchase health insurance (“individual m andate”).  Individuals who fail to have “m inimum \nessential coverage” required by this m andate must pay a monetary penalty.   See 26 U.S.C. § \n5000A(b)(1).  The “individual mandate” takes effect on January 1, 2014. \nThe Affordable Care Act — Not a Neutral Law of General Applicability \n21.  To date, HHS has granted over 1,000 i ndividualized w aiver requests from \nemployers and to insurance plans excusing their compliance with the Affordable Care Act. \n22.  Certain provisions of the Act do not apply to members of certain religious groups.  \nSee, e.g., 26 U.S.C. § 5000A(d)(2)(a)(i) and (ii) (indi vidual mandate does not apply to members \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 7 of 33\nof a “recognized religious sect or division” that conscientiously objects to acceptance of public \nor private insurance funds); § 5000A(d)(2)(a)(ii) (individual mandate does not apply to members \nof “health care sharing ministry” that meets certain criteria).  None of t hese exceptions apply to \nPriests for Life. \n23.  The contraceptive services m andate (described further below) does not apply to \nemployers who provide so-called “grandfathered” health care plans.  The Affordable Care Act’s \ndefault position is that an existing health care plan is not a grandfathered plan. \n24.  Priests for Life’s health care plan is not a grandfathered plan under the Affordable \nCare Act for m ultiple reasons, including, but n ot limited to, the follo wing: (1) the health care \nplan does not include the required “disclosure of  grandfather status” statem ent; (2) Priests for \nLife does not take the position that its health care plan is a grandfathered plan and thus does not \nmaintain the records necessary to verify, explain, or clarify its status as a grandfathered plan nor \nwill it make such records available for examination upon request; and (3) the health care plan has \nan increase in a percentage  cost-sharing requirement measured from March 23, 2010.   See 42 \nU.S.C. § 18011(a)(2); 26 C.F.R. § 54.9815-1251T; 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-1251; 45 C.F.R. § \n147.140. \n25.  The Affordable Care Act is not gen erally applicable because, inter alia, it does \nnot apply equally to all individuals and e mployers; because the Act provides for num erous \nexemptions from its provisions, including exem ptions for some religious groups and for som e \nreligious beliefs, but not for others, including  Priests for Life and its re ligious beliefs; and \nbecause HHS grants ind ividualized waiver requests excusing some employers from complying \nwith the provisions of the Act. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 8 of 33\n26.  The Affordable Care is not neutral because,  inter alia, some groups, both secular \nand religious, enjoy exemptions from certain provisions of the Act, which others do not; because \nsome groups, both secular and religious, hav e receiv ed waivers from com plying with the \nprovisions of the Act, while others have not.  Prie sts for Life is not eligible for any exemptions, \nand it is c ertainly not elig ible for an exem ption from the challenged contraceptive services \nmandate.  In fact, the m andate specifically targets for discriminatory treatment those religious  \ngroups such as Priests for Life that oppose provid ing coverage for, or  access to, “contraceptive \nservices” on the basis of their religious views. \n27.  The Affordable Care Act favors certain  religious organizations, beliefs, and \npractices, and it disfavors those  religious organizations, such as Priests for Life, that oppose \ncontraception, sterilization, and  abortifacients on religious grounds .  Thus, the Affordable Care  \nAct discriminates amongst similarly situated religious organizations on the bas is of religious \nbeliefs and practices. \nThe Affordable Care Act — Development of the Contraceptive Services Mandate \n28.  The Affordable Care Act mandates that health insurers “provide coverage for and \nshall not impose any cost sharing requirem ents for . . . with respect to wom en, such additional \npreventative care and screenings  . . . as provided for in comp rehensive guidelines supported by \nthe Health Resources and Services Administration.”  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). \n29.  While organizations with fewer than fi fty employees are not subject to the \n“corporate mandate” and are thus  not required to provide health  insurance for their em ployees \nunder the Act, if such organizations do offer  a health plan, they m ust comply with the \ncontraceptive services mandate.  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 9 of 33\n30.  On July 19, 2010, HHS, along with the Depart ment of Labor and the Department \nof the Treasury, published interim  final regulati ons “implementing the rules for group health \nplans and health insurance coverage in the group and individual markets under provisions of the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act rega rding preventive health services.”  75 Fed. Re g. \n41726 (July 19, 2010).  Among other things, the interim final regulations required health insurers \nto cover preventive care for wo men as provided for in “guide lines supported by the Health \nResources and Services Administration.”  75 Fed. Reg. at 41759. \n31.  HHS accepted public comments to the 2010  interim  fi nal regu lations until \nSeptember 17, 2010.  A large number of groups  filed comments, warning of the potential  \nconscience implications of requiring religious individuals and groups to pay for certain kinds of \nservices, including contraception, sterilization, and abortion. \n32.  HHS commissioned a study by a private hea lth policy organization, the Institute \nof Medicine (hereinafter “IOM”), “to review what preventive services are necessary for women’s \nhealth and well-being and should be considered in the development of comprehensive guidelines \nfor preventive services for women.”  (See http://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines).  \n33.  In conducting its study, IOM invited va rious pro-elective abortion groups and \nindividuals to make presentations on the preven tive care that should be  provided by all health \ninsurers, in cluding the following: the Guttm acher Ins titute, the Am erican Congress o f \nObstetricians and Gynecologis ts, the National Women’s Law Center,  the National W omen’s \nHealth Network, Planned Parenthood Federati on of Am erica, John Santelli, and Sara \nRosenbaum.  (See http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13181&page=217).  \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 10 of 33\n34.  No religious groups or other groups th at oppose government-mandated coverage \nof contraception, sterilization,  abortion, and relate d education and coun seling were am ong the \ninvited presenters.  (See http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13181&page=217).  \n35.  On July 19, 2011, IOM published a report of  its study regarding preventive care \nfor women.  Am ong other things, IOM recomm ended that preventive services include “[a]ll \nFood and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods [and] sterilization procedures.”  \n(See Institute of Medicine, Clinical Preventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps (2011)). \n36.  Federal Drug Adm inistration-approved  contraceptive m ethods include, am ong \nother drugs, devices and procedures , birth control pills, prescription contraceptive devices, Plan \nB (also known as the “morning after pill”), and ulipristal (also known as “ella” or the “week after \npill”). \n37.  Plan B and ella can prevent the implantation of a human embryo in the wall of the \nuterus and can cause the death  of an em bryo.  The use of ar tificial means to prevent the \nimplantation of a hum an embryo in the wall of th e uterus or to cause the death of an em bryo \nconstitutes an “abortion.”  Consequently, Plan B and ella are abortifacients. \n38.  On August  1, 2011, HHS’s Hea lth Resour ces and Services Adm inistration \n(hereinafter “HRSA”) announced that it was  supporting “the IOM’s  recommendations on \npreventive services that add ress h ealth needs   specific to  wom en and f ill gaps  in exis ting \nguidelines.”  HRSA entitled the recommendati ons, “Women’s Preventive Services: Required \nHealth Plan Coverage Guidelines.”  Among other things, HRSA’s Guidelines include “[a]ll Food \nand Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient \neducation and counseling for all wom en with reproductive capacity.”  ( See \nhttp://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines).    \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 11 of 33\nThe Affordable Care Act — Adoption of the Contraceptive Services Mandate \n39.  On August 3, 2011, HHS, along with the Departm ent of Labor and the \nDepartment of the Treasury, published interi m final regulations which, am ong other things, \nmandate that all health insurers “provide benefits for and prohibit the imposition of cost-sharing: \n. . . . W ith respect to wom en, preventive care and screening provided for in comprehensive \nguidelines supported by HRSA . . . which  will be commonly known as HRSA’ s Women’s \nPreventive Services: Required Health Plan Coverage Guidelines.”  76 Fed. Reg. 46621 (Aug. 3, \n2011); 45 C.F.R. § 147.130. \n40.  Defendant Departments “determined that an addition al opportunity for public \ncomment would be im practical and contrary to the publ ic interest” and pr omulgated the final \nregulation without waiting for public comment.  \n41.  The August 3, 2011, interim final regulations noted that “several commenters [to \nthe July 19, 2010 interim final regulations] asserted  that requiring group health plans sponsored \nby religious em ployers to cover co ntraceptive services that their faith deems contrary to its \nreligious tenets would impinge  upon their religious freedom.”  A ccordingly, as further noted in \nthe regulations, “the Departments seek to provide for a religious accommodation that respects the \nunique relationship between a hou se of worship a nd its e mployees in ministerial positions. . .   \n[T]he Departments are amending the interim final rules to provide HRSA additional discretion to \nexempt certain relig ious em ployees from  the Guidelin es where con traceptive s ervices are \nconcerned.”  76 Fed. Reg. at 46623. \n42.  For purposes of the discretionary exem ption set forth in the August 3, 2011, \ninterim final regulations, Defendants concluded that a “religious employer was one that: (1) Has \nthe inculcation of religious values as its pu rpose; (2) primarily employs persons who share its  \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 12 of 33\nreligious tenets; (3) primarily serves persons who share its religious tenets; and (4) is a non-profit \norganization under section 6033(a)(1) and section  6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii).”  76 F ed. Reg. at \n46623; 45 C.F.R. § 147.130. \n43.  Priests for Life did not qualify as a “religious employer” under this exemption. \n44.  Although HHS accepted public co mments to the 2011 interim  final regulations \nuntil September 30, 2011, it went into effect immediately.    \n45.  Accordingly, health ins urers were re quired to begin providing the m andated \ncontraceptive services coverage in the first p lan year (in the individual market, policy year) that \nbegan on or after August 1, 2012. \n46.  The United States Conference of Catholic  Bishops called for a rescission of the  \ncontraceptive services mandate, and, in the even t HHS insisted on keeping the m andate, urged \nHHS to provide a broad and com prehensive conscience exemption for all  of those persons and \norganizations that objected to  the mandate—not just the extrem ely small subset of “religious \nemployers” that HHS proposed to exempt initially. \n47.  On January 20, 2012, Defendant Sebelius  announced that: “Nonprofit employers \nwho, based on religious beliefs do not currently  provide contraceptive coverage in their \ninsurance plan, will be provided an additional year, until August 1, 2013, to comply with the new \nlaw.”  She further announced that: “We intend to require employers that do not offer coverage of \ncontraceptive services to provide  notice to employees, which will  also state that contraceptive \nservices are available at sites such as community health centers, public clinics, and hospitals with \nincome-based support.”  (See http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2012pres/01/20120120a.html).  \n48.  On February 10, 2012, President Oba ma announced that his adm inistration \nintended to propose and finalize a new regulation that “will require insurance companies to cover \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 13 of 33\ncontraception if the [non-exem pted] religious or ganization chooses not t o. . . .  Contraception \ncoverage will be offered to wom en by their empl oyers’ insurance companies directly, with no \nrole for religious em ployers who oppose contraception.”  ( See http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-\npress-office/2012/02/10/fact-sheet-women-s-preventive-services-and-religious-institutions).   \n49.  In conjunction with the President’s  announcement, Defendants created a \n“temporary enforcem ent safe harbor,” which is  a self-imposed stay of  enforcem ent of the \ncontraceptive services mandate for certain qualified organizations.  This “safe harbor” would \nremain in e ffect for the qualified organization until its f irst plan yea r that began on or after \nAugust 1, 2013.   See HHS, Guidance on Tem porary Enforcement Safe Harbor (Feb. 10, 2012); \n77 Fed. Reg. 16501, 16504 (Mar. 21, 2012).   \n50.  The “temporary enforcement safe harbor” applied if (1) the organization is a non-\nprofit; (2) “[f]rom February 10,  2012 onward, contraceptive coverage has not b een provided at \nany point by the group health pl an sponsored by the organization” ; (3) “[t]he group health plan \nsponsored by the organization . . . provides to plan participants a prescribed notice indicating that \nthe plan will not prov ide contraceptive coverage for the first plan y ear beginning on or after \nAugust 1, 2012”; and (4) “[t]he organization self-certifies that it satisfies the three criteria above, \nand documents its self -certification in acco rdance with prescrib ed procedures.”   See HHS , \nGuidance on Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor (Feb. 10, 2012). \n51.  On August 15, 2012, Defendants issued addi tional guidance clarifying the scope \nof the “temporary enforcem ent safe harbor.”   Under this additional guidance, so long as an \notherwise qualified organization “took some action to try to exclude or lim it such coverage that \nwas not successful as o f February 10, 2012,” th e organization could still  qualify for the safe \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 14 of 33\nharbor even if it provided contracep tive coverage after February 10, 2012.   See HHS, Guidance \non Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor (Aug. 15, 2012). \n52.  The “compromise” announced by President Obam a on February 10, 2012, was  \npromptly rejected by the Catholic Bishops becau se it to failed to p rotect religious freedom and \nthe right to conscience. \n53.  Defendants rejected consid ering a “broad er exem ption” from  the challenged  \nmandate because they believe that such an exemption “would lead to more employees having to \npay out of pocket for contraceptive services,  thus making it less likely that they would use  \ncontraceptives, which would undermine the benefits [of requiring the coverage].”  According to \nDefendants, “Employees that do not primarily employ employees who share the religious tenets \nof the organization are more likely to employ individuals who have no religious objection to the \nuse of contraceptive services and therefore are more likely to use contraceptives.  Including these \nemployers within the scope of the exe mption would subject their employees to the relig ious \nviews of th e employer, limiting  access to contraceptives, and  thereby inhibiting the use o f \ncontraceptive services and the benefits of preventive ca re.”  77 Fed. Re g. 8725, 8728 (Feb. 15, \n2012) (emphasis added).   \n54.  Thus, the u ltimate goal of Defendants is  to increase the “use of contraceptive \nservices” b y com pelling access to  these s ervices and to  ensure that em ployees, includ ing \nemployees of religious organizations such as Priests for Life, are not “subject” to the employer’s \nreligious beliefs regarding such “services.”  Thus, Defendants’ objective is in direct conflict with \nPriests for Life’s goals and religious mission. \n55.  Consequently, despite beginning the proc ess of a mending th e regulations by \npublishing an Advance Notice of Proposed  Rule Making in the Federal Register,  see 77 Fed. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 15 of 33\nReg. 16501 (Mar. 21, 2012), Defendants made it clear from the very beginning that they did not \nintend to provide a “broader  exemption” that would in  any way “inhibit[] the use of \ncontraceptive services” by e mployees or “subject  . . . e mployees to the religious views of the  \nemployer.”  In short, Defendants did not intend  to extend the exemption from the mandate to \norganizations such as P riests for Life in a  manner that would protect  and respect Priests for \nLife’s religious beliefs and convictions, as well as those who work for and associate with Priests \nfor Life, such as Fr. Pavone and Plaintiffs King and Morana. \n56.  Indeed, according to D efendants, they  were intent on developing “alternative \nways of providing contraceptive co verage” that would require “contraceptive coverage directly \nto the employer’s plan participants (and their benef iciaries) who desire it,” cla iming that there \nwould “be no charge for the contraceptive coverage.”  77 Fed. Reg. at 8728. \n57.  Thus, even under this proposed regulati on, which would soon becom e final (as \ndiscussed below), Priests for Life would still  be purchasing a health  care plan that provid es \n“contraceptive coverage directly to  [its] plan pa rticipants (and th eir beneficiaries),” which is  \nunacceptable to Priests for Life.  In deed, Priests for Life would still be paying for a health care \nplan that provides these immoral services “directly to” its em ployees in violation of Priests for \nLife’s sincerely held religious beliefs.  And as Defendants’ proposed regulations made clear, the \ngovernment is purposefully and intentionally inse rting itself into Priests for Life’s business \npractices so  that, according to the governm ent,  Priests fo r Life’s em ployees wo uld not be \n“subject” to Priests for Life’s  “religious views,” thereby dir ectly undermining and interfering \nwith Priests for Life’s religious beliefs and practices.   \n58.  While Defendant Sebelius claimed that women may pay up to $600 per year for \ncontraceptive serv ices, she asserted that insu rers could provide thos e serv ices to cove red \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 16 of 33\nemployees at no cost because “on balance, preventive services around family planning, avoiding \nwhat may be unhealthy pregnancies, avoiding the health consequences  of that actually is a cost \nreducer.”   \n59.  However, insurance companies do not dona te products and serv ices to covered \nemployees.  Drug m akers will s till charge ins urers for birth control pills, IUD’s, and other  \ncontraceptive devices.  Doctors will still bill insurers for reproductive treatm ent.  The reality, as \nwith all m andated benefits, is that these co sts will be bo rne eventually via high er premiums.  \nInsurers may amortize the cost differently over time, but eventually prices will find equilibrium.  \nThus, Priests for Life will still pay for contraceptive services, including abortifacients, even if it \nis nominally carried by a third-party corporation—its health insurance provider.   \nFinal Rules on Contraceptive Coverage and Religious Organizations \n60.  On June 28, 2013, the Oba ma administration announced that it had issued final \nrules on contraceptive coverage and religious organizations.  These final rules were published in \nthe Federal Register on July 2, 2013 and b ecame effective on August 1, 2013.  78 Fed. Reg. \n39870 (July 2, 2013).  \n61.  With the e xception of  the am endments to th e religious employer exemption, \nwhich apply to group health plans and health in surance issuers for plan years beginning on or \nafter August 1, 2012, these final regulations apply  to group health plans and health insurance \nissuers for plan years beginning on or  after January 1, 2014.   78 Fed. Reg. at 39870.   \nAccordingly, Defendants extended the “tem porary enforcement safe harbor” to enco mpass plan \nyears beginning on or after August 1, 2013, and before January 1, 2014.  78 Fed. Reg. at 39872.  \n62.  Pursuant to these final regulations, the  definition of “religious em ployer” for \npurposes of  the only exem ption from  the cont raceptive ser vices ma ndate that provides \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 17 of 33\nmeaningful protection f or religious liberty and the r ight of conscience (i.e., it exem pts the \norganization from having to provide any offendi ng coverage) was narrowed.  W hile the revised \ndefinition did eliminate three criteria from the  earlier definition of “religious employer” for \npurposes of this exemption, it ultimately includes only those organizations that fall under Section \n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of  the Internal Revenue Code.  78 Fed. Reg. at 39874.  These \norganizations are essentially churches and re ligious orders—a very  narrow class of nonprofit \norganizations.   \n63.  Priests for Life, while a nonprofit religious  organization, does not qualify for this \nnarrow exemption.  Consequently, Defendants re vised the religious employer exemption by not \nexpanding it for organizations such as Priests  for Life, but by excluding such organizations \naltogether. \n64.  The earlier definition o f “religious employer” included nonprofit organizations \ndescribed in section 6033(a)(1)  of the Code, which includes religious organizations such as \nPriests for Life.  However, Priests for Life was not eligible for the earlier exemption because of \nthe other criteria that are now removed by these final rules. \n65.  The final ru les also pro vide a so -called “accommodation” for certain  “eligible \norganizations.”  An “eligible organization” is an  organization that satisf ies all of the following \nrequirements: (1) the organiza tion opposes providing coverage  for som e or all of any \ncontraceptive services required to be covered by the challenged mandate on account of religious \nobjections; (2) the organization  is organized and ope rates as a nonprof it entity; (3) the \norganization holds itself out as a religious organization; and (4) the organization self-certifies, in \na form and manner specified by HHS, that it satisf ies the criteria in (1) through (3) above, and \nmakes such self-certification available for examination upon request by the first day of the first \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 18 of 33\nplan year to which the “accommodation” applies.  This self-certification must be executed by a \nperson authorized to ma ke the certification on  behalf of the organiza tion, and the organization \nmust retain a record of this self-certification. \n66.  A group health plan established or m aintained by an “eligible organization” that \nprovides benefits through one or more group health insurance issuers complies with the “eligible \norganization” requirements by furnishing a copy of  the s elf-certification to each issuer that \nwould otherwise provide coverage in connection with the group health plan.  An issuer may not \nrequire any docum entation other than the copy of  the self -certification f rom the elig ible \norganization regarding its status.   \n67.  A group health plan issuer  who receives a copy of the self-certification must: (1) \nexclude contraceptive coverage from the group health insurance coverage provided in connection \nwith the group health plan; and  (2) provide separate paym ents for any contraceptive services \nrequired to be covered for plan pa rticipants and beneficiaries so long as they remain enrolled in \nthe plan.  W ith respect to payments for contraceptive services, the issuer may not impose any \ncost-sharing requirements (such as a copaym ent, coinsurance, or a d eductible), or im pose any \npremium, fee, or other charge,  or any portion thereof, directly  or indirectly, on the eligible \norganization, the group health pl an, or plan participants or be neficiaries.  The issuer m ust \nsegregate premium revenue collected from  the e ligible organization from the m onies used to \nprovide payments for contraceptive services. \n68.  For each plan year to which the “accomm odation” applies, an issuer required to \nprovide payments for contraceptive services m ust provide to plan participants and beneficiaries \nwritten notice of  the  availab ility of  separate paym ents f or contrac eptive servic es \ncontemporaneous with (to the extent possible),  but separate from , any application m aterials \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 19 of 33\ndistributed in connection with en rollment (or re-enrollm ent) in group health coverage that is \neffective beginning on the first d ay of each applicable plan year.  The n otice must specify that \nthe eligible organization  does not administer or fund contracep tive benefits, but  that the issuer \nprovides separate payments for contraceptive services, and must provide contact information for \nquestions and complaints. \n69.  Consequently, because Priests for Life pr ovides its employees with a health care \nplan, the government mandate forces Priests for Life to pro vide the means and mechanism by \nwhich contraception, sterilization,  and abortifacients are p rovided to its em ployees, which is  \nunacceptable to Plaintiffs because it violates their sincerely held religious beliefs.  \n70.  There is no logical or moral distinction be tween the extant contraceptive services \nmandate, with its lim ited religious em ployer exemption, and the “accommodation” for certain \n“eligible organizations.”  Em ployers who offe r health insurance do not pay for individual  \nbenefits and products as they are provided.  Rath er, they pay a prem ium for a policy that gives \ntheir employees access to covered  benefits an d products when they need them .  Under the \n“accommodation,” all non-exempted health plans must necessarily include contraceptive services \namong their covered benefits.  Consequently, relig ious employers, such as Priests for Life, are \nstill paying an insurer to provide thei r employees with access to a product ( i.e., contraceptives, \nsterilization, and abortifacients) that violates their religious convictions.   \nPriests for Life — Mission \n71.  Priests for Life is a p rivate association of the f aithful, recognized and approved \nunder the Canon Law of the Catholic Church.  It  works in harm ony with the goals of the \nBishops’ Pro-Life Committee and the local diocesan respect life offices.   \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 20 of 33\n72.  Priests for Life was founded in 1991 to do  one of the most important tasks in the \nChurch today: to help spread the Gospel of Life.   \n73.  The mission of Priests for Life is to unite and encourage all clergy to give special \nemphasis to the life issues in their ministry.  It also  seeks to help them take a more vocal and \nactive role in the  pro-life movement.  Pr iests for Life exists to f ight the culture of death.  \nContraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and  abortion all promote and support th e culture of \ndeath and are therefore immoral and antithetical to Priests for Life’s religious mission. \n74.  Pursuant to its Mission Statement, Priests for Life seeks to: (1) unite, encourage, \nand provide ongoing training to pr iests and deacons who give a  special emphasis to the “life \nissues,” especially abortion and euthanasia, in their ministries; (2) instill a sense of urgency in all \nclergy to teach about these issu es and to m obilize their peopl e to help stop abortion and \neuthanasia; (3) assist clergy and laity to work together productively for the cause of life; and (4) \nprovide ongoing training and motivation to the entire pro-life movement. \n75.  Priests for Life offers a wide range of audios, videos, and brochures, and regularly \nuses the media of television, radio, and the printed press to spread the message of life.  \n76.  Fr. Pavone, the National Director of Priests  for Life, and his associates travel the \ncountry full time to meet with priests, pro-life groups, and others  to express, teach, and spread \nthe Gospel of Life.  This is a religious exercise for Fr. Pavone.   \n77.  The Gospel of Life promotes the culture  of life, which opposes contraception, \nsterilization, abortifacients, and abortion.   \n78.  Through his expressive association with  Priests for Life, Fr . Pavone spreads the \nGospel of Life. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 21 of 33\n79.  Fr. Pavone is the “face” of Pr iests for Life, and  he uses th e media of television, \nradio, and the printed press to spread Priests for Life’s message of life.  For example, Fr. Pavone \nhosts the Defending Life television series on  the Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN).   \nThrough his media appearances and other expressive activities, Fr. Pavone promotes the culture \nof life and actively oppos es the culture of death, which supports and prom otes the use of \ncontraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and abortion. \n80.  Plaintiff King uses the media of television, radio, and the printed press to spread \nPriests for Life’s m essage of life.  Through her  expressive association with Priests for L ife, \nPlaintiff King spreads  the Gospel  of Life.  This is a religious  exercise for Plaintiff King.   \nThrough her m edia appearances and other expressi ve activities, Plain tiff King prom otes the \nculture of life and actively opposes the culture of death. \n81.  Plaintiff Morana uses the m edia of tele vision, radio, and th e printed press to \nspread Priests for Life’s m essage of life.   She is featured on Fr. Pa vone’s Defending Life  \ntelevision series and is the Co-host of the The  Catholic View for Women, also seen on EW TN.  \nPlaintiff Morana is a w eekly guest on EW TN Global Catholic Radio with Teresa  Tomeo and \nnumerous other media outlets.  Through her expressive association with Priests for Life, Plaintiff \nMorana spreads the Gospel of Life.  This is a  religious exercise for Plaintiff Morana.  Through \nher media appearances and other ex pressive activities, Plaintiff Morana promotes the culture of \nlife and actively opposes the culture of death. \n82.  Priests for Life also represents a family  of ministries that reach and enrich every \naspect of th e pro-life m ovement, for clergy and laity alike,  in a wide variety of activities, \nincluding d irect m inistries to priests, deaco ns, and seminarians; yo uth outreach; healing \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 22 of 33\nministries; broadcasting; prayer campaigns; edu cation regarding public po licy; and facilitating \nrelationships among pro-life organizations and leaders. \n83.  In sum, Priests for L ife provides a wide range of serv ices to both Catholics and \nnon-Catholics as part of its pro-lif e ministry, and it engages in a wide-range of expressive , \nreligious activity to further its  pro-life mission.  Through their asso ciation with Priests for L ife, \nFr. Pavone and Plaintiffs King and Morana expr ess a pro-life m essage to further Priests for \nLife’s pro-life mission. \n84.  Indeed, an individual’s freedom to speak and to worship could not be vigorously \nprotected from interference by the government unless a correlative freedom to engage in a group \neffort toward those ends were not also guaranteed.  This freedom to associate is an indispensable \nmeans of preserving individual liberties such as the freedom of speech and the free exercise of \nreligion.  By subjecting Priests for Life to the contraceptive services mandate as set forth in this \nComplaint, Defendants are infringing upon the  constitutional freedom s of Fr. Pavone and \nPlaintiffs King and Morana, who associate with  Priests for Life for purposes of promoting the \nculture of life through speech and religious activities protected by the First Amendment. \nPlaintiffs’ Sincerely Held Religious Beliefs Regarding  \nContraceptive Practices and Abortion \n85.  A deep devotion to the Catholic faith is central to the mission of Priests for Life. \n86.  Priests for Life holds and actively prof esses religious beliefs that include \ntraditional Christian te aching on the nature a nd purpose of human sexuality.  In  particular, in \naccordance with Pope P aul VI’s 1968 encyclical Humanae Vitae, Priests for Life believes that \nhuman sexuality has two primary purposes: to “most closely unit[e] husband and wife” and “for \nthe generation of new lives.”  Priests for Life believes and actively professes the Catholic Church \nteaching that “[t]o use this divine gift destroying, even if only partially, its meaning and purpose \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 23 of 33\nis to contradict the nature both of man and of woman and of their most intimate relationship, and \ntherefore it is to  contradict also the plan of  God and His  Will.”  Theref ore, Priests for Life \nbelieves and teaches th at “any action which either  before, at the m oment of, or after sexual \nintercourse, is specifically intended to prevent procreation, w hether as an end or as a m eans”—\nincluding contraception and sterilization—is a grave sin.   \n87.  Plaintiffs believe, as Pope Pa ul VI prophetically stated in  Humanae Vitae, that \n“man, growing used to the em ployment of anticonceptive practices, may finally lose respect for \nthe woman and, no lon ger caring for her physical  and psychological equilibrium, may come to \nthe point of considering her as a m ere instrument of selfish enjoym ent, and no longer as his \nrespected and beloved com panion.”  Consequentl y, Plaintiffs believe that the contraceptive  \nservices mandate harms women. \n88.  Priests for Life holds and actively prof esses religious beliefs that include \ntraditional Christian te aching on the sanctity  of  life.  It b elieves and teache s that each hum an \nbeing bears the image and likeness of God, and th erefore all human life is sacred and precious \nfrom the mom ent of conception.   Consequently, Priests for Li fe believes and teaches that \nabortion ends a human life and is a grave sin. \n89.  Further, Priests for Lif e subscribes to  authoritative Catholic  teaching about the \nproper nature and aim s of health care and m edical treatment.  For example, Priests for Life \nbelieves, in  accordance with Pope John Paul II’s 1995 encyclical  Evangelium Vitae , that \n“‘[c]ausing death’ can never be considered a  form of m edical treatment,” but rather “runs \ncompletely counter to the health-care professi on, which is m eant to be an im passioned and \nunflinching affirmation of life.” \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 24 of 33\n90.  Based on the teachings of the Catholic Church, and its own sincerely held beliefs, \nPriests for Life does not believe that contracep tion, sterilization, abortifacients, or abortion are \nproperly understood to constitute  medicine, health care, or a m eans of providing for the well-\nbeing of persons.  Indeed, Priests for Life beli eves these procedures  involve gravely immoral \npractices. \n91.  As part of its religious m inistry, Priests for L ife promotes the culture o f life by \ndirectly an d em phatically oppos ing the use of contraceptive s, sterilization  practices, \nabortifacients, and abortion.  Acco rding to Priests for L ife’s sincerely held religious beliefs, \ncontraception, sterilization, abortifacients, and abortion are not m orally neutral.  Consequently, \nPriests for Life actively opposes the use of such immoral drugs and procedures. \n92.  Fr. Pavone and Plaintiffs King and Morana share Priests for Life’s sincerely held \nreligious beliefs described in this Complaint.   \nPriests for Life — Employee Health Insurance \n93.  As part of its comm itment to Catholic  social teaching, Priests for Life prom otes \nthe health and well-being of its employees.  In furtherance of this commitment, Priests for Life \nprovides health insurance for its employees. \n94.  Priests for Life ensures that its in surance policies do not cover, promote, or \nprovide access to drugs, de vices, services, or procedures inc onsistent with its faith, including \ncontraception. \n95.  Priests for Life cannot provide health  insurance that su pports—directly or \nindirectly—artificial contraception, sterili zation, abortifacients, abor tion, or related education \nand counseling without violating its sincerely held religious beliefs.  \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 25 of 33\n96.  Priests for Life cannot provide health insurance that provides access to and makes \navailable contraception, sterilization, abor tifacients, abortion, or  related education and \ncounseling without violating its sincerely held religious beliefs. \n97.  Priests for Life cannot provide inform ation or guidance to its em ployees about \nother locations at which they can access artificia l contraception, sterilization, abortifacients, \nabortion, or related education an d counseling without violating  its sincerely held religious \nbeliefs. \n98.  In short, Priests for Life cannot comply with the contracep tive services mandate \nand its so-called “accommodation” without violating its sincerely held religious beliefs. \n99.  Priests for Life is funded solely th rough tax-deductible donations.  Donors who \ngive to Priests for Life do so  with an understanding of Priest  for Life’s m ission and with the \nassurance that Priests for Life wi ll continue  to adhere to, dissem inate, and report reliable  \nCatholic teaching on the sanctity of life and human sexuality. \n100.  Priests for Life cannot use donated f unds for purposes known to be m orally \nrepugnant to its donors and in ways  that would violate the implicit trust of the purpose for their \ndonations. \n101.  Priests for Life’s next plan year will commence on January 1, 2014.  \nPriests for Life — Harm Caused by the Imposition of the Challenged Mandate \n102.  Because of the contraceptive servi ces m andate, in cluding the s o-called \n“accommodation,” Priests for Life must now make business decisions that will affect its ability \nto continue the services it provides.  As a  nonprofit organization, Priests for Lif e funds its \noperations almost entirely through tax-deductible donations, includi ng planned giving.  Priests \nfor Life must make business decisions now base d on what it expects to  receive in donations in \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 26 of 33\nthe future.  This requires Priests for Life to look several years ahead to determine what its budget \nwill be and thus what services it will be capable of providing.  Priests for Life’s donors will not \nsupport an organization that provides its employees with access to contraception, sterilization, or \nabortifacients—practices that run counter to Priests for Life’s  mission, goals, and message—the \nvery basis for the donations in the first instance.   \n103.  Indeed, the current mandate with its limited religious employer exemption and so-\ncalled “accommodation” will force Priests for Life out of the market for health care services and \nthus adversely affect it as an organization.  Many of Priests for Life’s valued employees, without \nwhom Priests for Life could not provide its much needed services, will be forced to leave Priests \nfor Life and seek other employment that provides health care benefits. \n104.  The contraceptive services m andate is causing Priests for Life to feel econom ic \nand moral pressure today as a result of the  government imposing subs tantial burdens on th e \nreligious beliefs and practices of Priests for Life. \n105.  In sum, Priests for Life, a Catholic organization, is morally prohibited based on its \nsincerely held religious convictions from cooperating with evil.  Priests for Life objects to being \nforced by the government to purchase a health care plan that provides its employees with access \nto contraceptives, sterilization, a nd abortifacients, all of which  are prohibited by its religious \nconvictions.  This is true whether the imm oral services are paid for direc tly, indirectly, or even \nnot at all by Priests for Life.  Contracepti on, ste rilization, and abor tifacients ar e imm oral \nregardless of their cost.  And Priests for Life  objects to the governm ent forcing it into a m oral \ndilemma with regard to its relationsh ip with its employees and its very survival as an effective, \npro-life organization.   \n \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 27 of 33\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(Free Exercise of Religion — Violation of the First Amendment) \n106.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference all stated paragraphs set forth herein. \n107.  The contraceptive services mandate, as set f orth in this Complaint, vio lates the \nFree Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n108.  Plaintiffs’ sincerely held religious be liefs prohibit them  from  promoting or \nsupporting—directly or indirect ly—contraception, sterilization,  abortifacients, abortion, and \nrelated education and counseling, including providing a health care plan that provides access to \nor the means of acquiring such immoral services.   Plaintiffs’ compliance with these beliefs is a \nreligious exercise. \n109.  The contraceptive services mandate, as set f orth in this Complaint, sub stantially \nburdens Plaintiffs’ sincerely held religious beliefs. \n110.  The contr aceptive serv ices m andate, as se t f orth in  this  Com plaint, crea tes \ngovernment-imposed coercive pressure on Plaintiffs  to change or violat e their sincerely held \nreligious beliefs. \n111.  The contraceptive services mandate, as set forth in this Complaint, exposes Priests \nfor Life to  significant competitive disadvantage, in that it will no longer be able to offer its \nemployees health insurance. \n112.  The contraceptive services mandate, as set f orth in th is Complaint, does no t \nfurther any compelling governmental interest. \n113.  The contraceptive services mandate, as set forth in this Complaint, is not the least \nrestrictive means to accomplish any permissible governmental interest. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 28 of 33\n114.  The contraceptive services mandate, as set forth in this Complaint, is a restriction \non the free exercise of  religion w hich is not  narrowly tailored to advance any perm issible \ngovernmental interest. \n115.  The contraceptive services mandate, as set forth in this Complaint, is not a neutral \nlaw of general applicability. \n116.  Notwithstanding its rec eipt of multiple objections to the c ontraceptive services \nmandate on the basis that it woul d violate sincerely held religi ous beliefs, Defendants designed \nthat requirement and its re ligious employer exemption and “accom modation” in a way that \nmakes it impossible for Plaintiffs to comply with their religious beliefs. \n117.  By design, the contraceptive services m andate, as set forth in this Complaint, is \nimposed on som e religious organizations, but  not others, resulting in  discrimination among \nreligions. \n118.  The contraceptive s ervices mandate, as set  forth in this Com plaint, is of ficial \ngovernment action that targets re ligious conduct and beliefs for di stinctive, discriminatory, and \nadverse treatment. \n119.  Defendants promulgated the contraceptive services m andate, as set forth in this \nComplaint, to adversely target  and suppress the right to free ex ercise of religion of religious \norganizations such as Priests for Life. \n120.  Defendants’ violation of Plai ntiffs’ right to free exercise of religion has caused, \nand will continue to cause, Plaintiffs to suffer undue hardship and irreparable injury. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(Violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act) \n121.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference all stated paragraphs set forth herein. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 29 of 33\n122.  The contraceptive services mandate, as set f orth in this Complaint, vio lates the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act.  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb, et seq. \n123.

Plaintiffs’ compliance with these beliefs is a \nreligious exercise. \n124.  The contraceptive services mandate, as set f orth in this Complaint, sub stantially \nburdens Plaintiffs’ sincerely held religious beliefs. \n125.  The contraceptive services mandate, as set f orth in th is Complaint, does no t \nfurther any compelling governmental interest. \n126.  The contraceptive services mandate, as set forth in this Complaint, is not the least \nrestrictive means to accomplish any permissible governmental interest. \n127.  Defendants’ violation of the Religious  Freedom Restoration Act has caused, and \nwill continue to cause, Plaintiffs to suffer undue hardship and irreparable injury. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(Freedom of Speech and Expressive Association — Violation of the First Amendment) \n128.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference all stated paragraphs set forth herein. \n129.  The contrac eptive s ervices m andate, as set f orth in th is Com plaint, violate s \nPlaintiffs’ right to freedom  of spe ech and ex pressive ass ociation gu aranteed by  the First \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. \n130.  The contraceptive services m andate, as  set f orth in th is Com plaint, com pels \nPriests for Life to subsidize and/or provide  access to education and counseling regarding \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 30 of 33\ncontraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and abortif acients in violation of its sincerely \nheld religious beliefs. \n131.  The contraceptive services m andate, as  set f orth in th is Com plaint, com pels \nPriests for Life to enga ge in spee ch that is co ntrary to its  sincerely held religious beliefs and \ncontrary to the m essage that Fr. Pavone and Plai ntiffs King and Morana express on behalf of \nPriests for Life pursuant to their association with the pro-life organization. \n132.  By subjecting Priests for Life to the contraceptive services mandate as set forth in \nthis Complaint, Defendants are infringing upon  the constitutional freedom s of Fr. Pavone and \nPlaintiffs King and Morana, who associate with  Priests for Life for purposes of promoting the \nculture of life through speech and religious activities protected by the First Amendment. \n133.  The contraceptive services mandate, as set forth in this Complaint, is not narrowly \ntailored to advance a compelling governmental interest. \n134.  Defendants promulgated the contraceptive services m andate, as set forth in this \nComplaint, with the intent and purpose to harm the pro-life speech of religious organizations and \nindividuals such as Plaintiffs. \n135.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs’ right to free speech and expressive association \nhas caused, and will continue to cause, Plaintiffs to suffer undue hardship and irreparable injury. \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Establishment Clause — Violation of the First Amendment) \n136.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference all stated paragraphs set forth herein. \n137.  By favoring some religious beliefs and pr actices, but disfavoring those sincerely \nheld religious beliefs and practic es of Plaintiffs, Defendants ha ve violated the Es tablishment \nClause of the First Amendment. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 31 of 33\n138.  The contraceptive services mandate, as set forth in this Complaint, lacks a secular \npurpose, has the prim ary effect of inhibiting religion, and creates  excessive entanglement with \nreligion in violation of the Establishment Clause.   \n139.  The contraceptive services mandate, as set f orth in this Complaint, co nveys an \nimpermissible, governm ent-sponsored m essage of  disapproval of and  hostility toward the \nCatholic C hurch and Catholic religious belie fs and practices.  As a result, Defendants’ \ncontraceptive services mandate sends a clear message to Plaintiffs and others who are adherents \nto the Catholic faith that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community and an \naccompanying message that those who oppose the Catholic Church and Catholic religious beliefs \nand practices by accepting and promoting contraceptive services, are insiders, favored members \nof the political community, in violation of the Establishment Clause.   \n140.  Defendants’ violation of the Establishment Clause has caused, and will continue \nto cause, Plaintiffs to suffer undue hardship and irreparable injury.   \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Equal Protection — Violation of the Fifth Amendment) \n141.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference all stated paragraphs set forth herein. \n142.  By exe mpting som e religious organiza tions from  the requirem ents of the \nAffordable Care Act and its contraceptive services mandate on the basis of religious beliefs and \npractices, but forcing Priests for Life to comply in violation of its sincerely held religious beliefs, \nDefendants have deprived Plaintiffs of the equal protection of the law guaranteed under the Fifth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 1   Filed 08/19/13   Page 32 of 33\n143.  By favoring some religious beliefs and pr actices, but disfavoring those sincerely \nheld religious beliefs and practices of Plaintiffs, Defendants have deprived Plaintiffs of the equal \nprotection of the law guaranteed under the Fifth Amendment. \n144.  The contraceptive services mandate, as set forth in this Complaint, discriminates \namongst similarly situated religious organizations on the basis of  religious beliefs and practices \nin violation of the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment. \n145.  Defendants’ violation of the Fifth Amendment has caused, and will continue to  \ncause, Plaintiffs to suffer undue hardship and irreparable injury.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  Wherefore, Plaintiffs pray for judgment as follows: \nA.  That this Court declare that the contraceptive services mandate, as set forth in this \nComplaint, violates the First and Fifth Am endments to th e United States Cons titution and the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act; \nB.  That this C ourt preliminarily and perm anently enjoin the c ontraceptive services \nmandate, as set forth in this Complaint; \nC.

L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010).  A number of \ncircuits, including the District of Columbia Circuit, have \nexamined the mandate’s requirements regarding contraceptive \ncoverage for employees of for-profit companies; that issue is \nnow pending before the Supreme Court.  See Hobby Lobby Stores, \nInc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d 1114, (10th Cir. 2013) (en banc), \ncert. granted, 2013 U.S. LEXIS 8418 (U.S. Nov. 26, 2013) (Case \nNo. 13-354); Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sebelius, 724 \nF.3d 377 (3d Cir. 2013), cert. granted, 2013 U.S. LEXIS 8418 \n(U.S. Nov. 26, 2013) (No. 13-354); see also, e.g., Gilardi v. \nUnited States Dep’t of Health and Human Services, 733 F.3d 1208 \n(D.C. Cir. 2013).   \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 2 of 45\nThe instant case presents a different issue: the \nobligations, vel non, of non-profit religious organizations to \nprovide contraceptive coverage under the mandate.  These \norganizations are eligible for an accommodation to the mandate; \nspecifically, they are not required to provide contraceptive \ncoverage to their employees if they object to doing so on \nreligious grounds.  Under the regulations, an employer in this \nsituation can self-certify to its health insurance issuer that \nit has a religious objection to providing coverage for \ncontraceptive services as part of its health insurance plan.  \nOnce the issuer receives the self-certification, the non-profit \norganization is exempt from the mandate.  The organization’s \nemployees will receive coverage for contraceptive services, but \nthat coverage will be provided directly through the issuer.  The \ncoverage is excluded from the employer’s plan of benefits, and \nthe issuer assumes the full costs of coverage; it is prohibited \nfrom charging any co-payments, deductibles, fees, premium hikes \nor other costs to the organization or its employees. \nPriests for Life, a non-profit organization which takes a \n“vocal and active role in the pro-life movement,” Complaint ¶ \n73,  and three of its employees have filed this lawsuit objecting \nto the accommodation to the mandate.  They allege that the self-\ncertification Priests for Life must provide to its issuer \nviolates their rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 3 of 45\nAct, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb, et seq. (“RFRA”), and the First and \nFifth Amendments to the Constitution.   \nThe Supreme Court has made clear that religious exercise is \nimpermissibly burdened when government action compels \nindividuals “to perform acts undeniably at odds with fundamental \ntenets of their religious beliefs.”  Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 \nU.S. 205, 218 (1972).  At the same time, acts of third parties, \nwhich do not cause adherents to act in violation of their \nreligious beliefs, do not constitute an impermissible burden.  \nKaemmerling v. Lappin, 553 F.3d 669, 678 (D.C. Cir. 2008).  The \nright to religious freedom “simply cannot be understood to \nrequire the Government to conduct its [] affairs in ways that \ncomport with the religious beliefs of particular citizens.”  \nBowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693, 699 (1986).  Religious freedom is \nprotected “in terms of what the government cannot do to the \nindividual, not in terms of what the individual can exact from \nthe government.”  Lyng v. N’west Indian Cemetery Protective \nAssn., 485 U.S. 439, 451 (1988) (citations omitted). \nPlaintiffs here do not allege that the self-certification \nitself violates their religious beliefs.  To the contrary, the \ncertification states that Priests for Life is opposed to \nproviding contraceptive coverage, which is consistent with those \nbeliefs.  Indeed, during oral argument, plaintiffs stated that \nthey have no religious objection to filling out the self-\n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 4 of 45\ncertification; it is the issuer’s subsequent provision of \ncoverage to which they object.  But filling out the form is all \nthat the ACA requires of the plaintiffs in this case.   \nThere is no doubt that the plaintiffs find the statute’s \nrequirement that the issuer provide contraceptive coverage \nprofoundly opposed to their religious scruples.  But the \nissuer’s provision of coverage is just that -- an entirely third \nparty act.  The issuer’s provision of coverage does not require \nplaintiffs to “perform acts” at odds with their beliefs.  Yoder, \n406 U.S. at 218.  Accordingly, the accommodations to the \ncontraceptive services mandate do not violate their religious \nrights. \nPending before the Court is the plaintiffs’ motion for \nsummary judgment and the defendants’ cross motion to dismiss or \nin the alternative for summary judgment.  Upon consideration of \nthe motions, the oppositions and replies thereto, the Amicus \nCuriae brief of the American Civil Liberties Union, the entire \nrecord, and for the reasons explained below, defendants’ motion \nto dismiss is GRANTED; accordingly, the parties’ motions for \nsummary judgment are hereby DENIED AS MOOT. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nPriests for Life is a non-profit corporation incorporated \nin the State of New York, and Father Frank Pavone, Alveda King, \nand Janet Morana are among its employees.  Compl. ¶¶ 6-11. “A \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 5 of 45\ndeep devotion to the Catholic faith is central to the mission of \nPriests for Life.” Compl. ¶ 85.  Its mission is to “unite and \nencourage all clergy to give special emphasis to the life issues \nin their ministry . . . [and] to help them take a more vocal and \nactive role in the pro-life movement.”  Compl. ¶ 73.  \nAccordingly, “contraception, sterilization, abortifacients1 and \nabortion . . . are immoral and antithetical to Priests for \nLife’s religious mission.”  Id.  Priests for Life provides \nhealth insurance for its employees.  Compl. ¶ 93.  The next plan \nyear will commence on January 1, 2014.  Compl. ¶ 101. \nPlaintiffs’ claims arise out of certain regulations \npromulgated in connection with the ACA.  The Act requires all \ngroup health plans and health insurance issuers that offer non-\ngrandfathered group or individual health coverage to provide \ncoverage for certain preventive services without cost-sharing, \nincluding, for “women, such additional preventive care and \nscreenings . . . as provided for in comprehensive guidelines \nsupported by the Health Resources and Services Administration \n[(“HRSA”)].”  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4).  The HRSA, an agency \nwithin the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), \ncommissioned the Institute of Medicine (“IOM”) to conduct a \n                                                            \n1 Plaintiffs use the word “abortifacient” to refer to drugs such \nas Plan B and Ella that they allege cause abortions.  See, e.g., \nCompl. ¶ 37.  Plaintiffs do not allege that the regulations will \nrequire them to provide insurance coverage for the medical \nprocedure of abortion. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 6 of 45\nstudy on preventive services.  On August 1, 2011, HRSA adopted \nIOM’s recommendation to include “all Food and Drug \nAdministration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization \nprocedures, and patient education and counseling for women with \nreproductive capacity.”  See HRSA, Women’s Preventive Services: \nRequired Health Plan Coverage Guidelines (“HRSA Guidelines”), \navailable at http://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/ (last visited \nDec. 17, 2013).   \nSeveral exemptions and safe-harbor provisions excuse \ncertain employers from providing group health plans that cover \nwomen’s preventive services as defined by HHS regulations.  \nFirst, the mandate does not apply to certain “grandfathered” \nhealth plans in which individuals were enrolled on March 23, \n2010, the date the ACA was enacted.  75 Fed. Reg. 34,538 (June \n17, 2010).  Second, certain “religious employers” are excluded \nfrom the mandate. See, e.g., 76 Fed. Reg. 46,621 (Aug. 3, 2011); \n45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)(A).  On June 28, 2013, the \ngovernment issued final rules on contraceptive coverage and \nreligious organizations; the rules became effective August 1, \n2013.  78 Fed. Reg. 39,870 (July 2, 2013).  These regulations \nare the subject of this case. \n   Under the final regulations, a “religious employer” exempt \nfrom the contraceptive services mandate is “an organization that \nis organized and operates as a nonprofit entity and is referred \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 7 of 45\nto in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (a)(3)(A)(iii) of the Internal \nRevenue Code,” which refers to churches, their integrated \nauxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches, and \nthe exclusively religious activities of any religious order.  45 \nC.F.R. § 147.131(a).  Non-profit organizations which do not \nqualify for this exemption may, however, qualify for an \naccommodation with respect to the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement if they are “eligible organizations” under the \nregulations.  An “eligible organization” must satisfy the \nfollowing criteria: \n(1)  The organization opposes providing coverage for some or \nall of any contraceptive services required to be covered \nunder § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) on account of religious \nobjections. \n(2)  The organization is organized and operates as a non-\nprofit entity. \n(3)  The organization holds itself out as a religious \norganization. \n(4)  The organization self-certifies, in the form and manner \nspecified by the Secretary, that it satisfies the \ncriteria in paragraphs (1) through (3), and makes such \nself-certification available for examination upon request \nby the first day of the first plan year to which the \naccommodation applies. \n45 C.F.R. § 147.131(b); see also 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874-75.   \nOnce an eligible organization provides a copy of a self-\ncertification to its issuer, which provides coverage in \nconnection with the group health plan, the organization is \nrelieved of its obligation “to contract, arrange, pay or refer \nfor contraceptive coverage” to which it has religious \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 8 of 45\nobjections.  78 Fed. Reg. at 39,874.  The group health plan \nissuer which receives the self-certification form must (1) \nexclude contraceptive coverage from the group health insurance \ncoverage provided in connection with the group health plan, and \n(2) provide separate payments for any contraceptive services \nrequired to be covered for plan participants and beneficiaries.  \nThe issuer may not impose any cost-sharing requirements (such as \na copayment, coinsurance or a deductible) on plan participants \nor beneficiaries. 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,896.  Likewise, the issuer \nis prohibited from imposing any premium, fee, or other charge, \nor any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the eligible \norganization or the group health plan.  Id.  Failure to self-\ncertify or otherwise comply with the mandate will result in \nPriests for Life’s issuer including contraceptive services \nwithin Priests for Life’s healthcare policy, and charging the \norganization for such coverage.2 \n                                                            \n2 During the initial briefing, the parties stated that if Priests \nfor Life refused the accommodation, it could be fined $100 per \nemployee per day.  26 U.S.C. § 4980D.  At oral argument, \nhowever, the government informed the court that the ACA imposes \nan independent obligation on insurers to sell policies which \ncomply with the law, including, e.g., coverage for contraceptive \nservices.  See Defs.’ Suppl. Mem. at 1-4 [ECF No. 31], citing 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 300gg-13; 300gg-22; 76 Fed. Reg. 46,621, 623 (Aug. 3, \n2011).  This does not alter the analysis, however.  Under the \nstatute and regulations, if Priests for Life refuses the \naccommodation, it would then be placed in the position of \nproviding contraceptive services to its employees as part of its \nplan of benefits, and paying for such services.  As this Circuit \nheld in Gilardi, this arrangement would substantially burden \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 9 of 45\nThe parties agree that Priests for Life does not qualify \nfor an exemption to the contraceptive services mandate.  The \ngrandfathered plans provision does not protect the organization \nbecause the current health insurance plan has made changes since \n2010, including an increase in the percentage cost-sharing \nrequirement.  See Decl. of Fr. Pavone, ECF No. 7-1, at ¶ 5. \nPriests for Life also does not satisfy the definition of \n“religious employer” and is not eligible for an exemption on \nthat ground.  Id. at ¶ 3.  Finally, the parties agree that \nPriests for Life would qualify as an “eligible organization,” \nentitled to the accommodation, if it completes the self-\ncertification form.  Compl. ¶ 6.   \nPriests for Life states that completing the self-\ncertification form will require it to violate its sincerely held \nreligious beliefs because “the government mandate forces Priests \nfor Life to provide the means and mechanism by which \ncontraception, sterilization and abortifacients are provided to \nits employees. . . . There is no logical or moral distinction \nbetween the [] contraceptive services mandate . . . and the \n“accommodation[.]” . . .  Priests for Life [is] still paying an \ninsurer to provide [its] employees with access to a product [] \nthat violates [its] religious convictions.”  Compl. ¶¶ 69-70, \n                                                                                                                                                                                                \nPlaintiffs’ free exercise of religion. Gilardi, 733 F.3d at \n1216-19. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 10 of 45\nsee also id. ¶ 105 (“Priests for Life objects to being forced by \nthe government to purchase a health care plan that provides its \nemployees with access to contraceptives, sterilization and \nabortifacients, all of which are prohibited by its religious \nconvictions.  This is true whether the immoral services are paid \nfor directly, indirectly, or even not at all by Priests for \nLife.”). \nOn September 19, 2013, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary \ninjunction as to all counts of the Complaint.  On September 25, \n2013, the parties agreed to consolidate the preliminary \ninjunction motion with the merits under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 65(a)(2).  Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a motion for \nsummary judgment and defendants filed a cross motion to dismiss \nor in the alternative for summary judgment.  Toward the end of \nthe briefing schedule set by the Court, the D.C. Circuit issued \nits decision in Gilardi, addressing religious freedom claims \narising from different regulations under the ACA’s contraceptive \nservices mandate.  Following Gilardi, the Court ordered the \nparties to file supplemental briefs addressing its impact on \nthis case.  The Court heard oral argument on the parties’ cross \nmotions on December 9, 2013.  The motions are ripe for \ndetermination by the Court. \n \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 11 of 45\nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nA. Motion to Dismiss \nA motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6) “tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint.” Browning \nv. Clinton, 292 F.3d 235, 242 (D.C. Cir. 2002). A complaint must \ncontain “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that \nthe pleader is entitled to relief, in order to give the \ndefendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds \nupon which it rests.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, \n555 (2007) (quotation marks omitted; alteration in original). \nWhile detailed factual allegations are not necessary, plaintiffs \nmust plead enough facts “to raise a right to relief above the \nspeculative level.” Id.   \nWhen ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court may \nconsider “the facts alleged in the complaint, documents attached \nas exhibits or incorporated by reference in the complaint, and \nmatters about which the Court may take judicial notice.” \nGustave-Schmidt v. Chao, 226 F. Supp. 2d 191, 196 (D.D.C. 2002).  \nThe Court must construe the complaint liberally in plaintiffs’ \nfavor and grant plaintiffs the benefit of all reasonable \ninferences deriving from the complaint. Kowal v. MCI Commc’ns \nCorp., 16 F.3d 1271, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 1994). However, the Court \nmust not accept plaintiffs’ inferences that are “unsupported by \nthe facts set out in the complaint.” Id. “Nor must the court \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 12 of 45\naccept legal conclusions cast in the form of factual \nallegations.” Id. “[O]nly a complaint that states a plausible \nclaim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.” Ashcroft v. \nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009). \nB. Motion for Summary Judgment \n    Summary judgment is appropriate “if the movant shows that \nthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the \nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56(a).  The party seeking summary judgment bears the \n“initial responsibility of informing the district court of the \nbasis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the \npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and \nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, which \nit believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact.”  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 \n(1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).  To defeat summary \njudgment, the non-moving party must “designate specific facts \nshowing there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Id. at 324 \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  The existence of a factual \ndispute is insufficient to preclude summary judgment.  Anderson \nv. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247–48 (1986).  A dispute \nis “genuine” only if a reasonable fact-finder could find for the \nnon-moving party; a fact is only “material” if it is capable of \naffecting the outcome of the litigation.  Id. at 248; Laningham \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 13 of 45\nv. U.S. Navy, 813 F.2d 1236, 1241 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  In \nassessing a party’s motion, “[a]ll underlying facts and \ninferences are analyzed in the light most favorable to the non-\nmoving party.”  N.S. ex rel. Stein v. District of Columbia, 709 \nF. Supp. 2d 57, 65 (D.D.C. 2010), citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at \n247. \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nA. Standing \nThe parties do not dispute that Priests for Life, a non-\nprofit religious organization, has standing to advance all of \nits constitutional and statutory claims.  See, e.g., Jimmy \nSwaggart Ministries v. Bd. of Equalization of Cal., 493 U.S. \n378, 381, 384 (1990); EEOC v. Catholic Univ. of Am., 83 F.3d \n455, 467-70 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  The Court, therefore, has \njurisdiction to hear and decide the issues presented by this \ncase. Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & Inst’l Rights, Inc., 547 \nU.S. 47, 52 n.2 (2006) (“[T]he presence of one party with \nstanding is sufficient to satisfy Article III’s case-or-\ncontroversy requirement.”). \nWhile the defendants challenge standing of the individual \nplaintiffs, they acknowledge that the individual plaintiffs’ \nclaims are identical to Priests for Life’s claims.  See Defs.’ \nCombined Mot. to Dismiss or for Summ. J and Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. \n(hereinafter “Defs.’ Mot.”) at 13, n.8.  At oral argument, the \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 14 of 45\nparties agreed that it is unnecessary for the Court to address \nthe standing of the individual plaintiffs. See, e.g., Chamber of \nCommerce v. EPA, 642 F.3d 192, 200 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (it is \nunnecessary to address the standing of party whose presence or \nabsence is immaterial to a suit’s outcome, where another party \nclearly has standing) (citation omitted).  Accordingly, because \nthe presence of the individual plaintiffs has no impact on the \nmerits of this case, the Court need not reach the issue of their \nstanding. \nB. The RFRA \nThe Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb-\n1, provides that “[g]overnment shall not substantially burden a \nperson’s exercise of religion even if the burden results from a \nrule of general applicability, except as provided in subsection \n(b).”  Subsection (b) provides that “[g]overnment may \nsubstantially burden a person’s exercise of religion only if it \ndemonstrates that application of the burden to the person is (1) \nin furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is \nthe least restrictive means of furthering that compelling \ngovernmental interest.”   \nCongress enacted the RFRA in response to the Supreme \nCourt’s decision in Employment Division, Department of Human \nServices of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), in which the \nCourt held that the right to free exercise of religion under the \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 15 of 45\nFirst Amendment does not exempt an individual from a law that is \nneutral and of general applicability, and explicitly disavowed \nthe test used in earlier decisions, which prohibited the \ngovernment from substantially burdening a plaintiff’s religious \nexercise unless the government could show that its action served \na compelling interest and was the least restrictive means to \nachieve that interest.  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb.  The purpose of the \nRFRA was to “restore the compelling interest test” as set forth \nin Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963) and Wisconsin v. \nYoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972).  Id. \nIn order to state a prima facie case under RFRA, and thus \nto survive a motion to dismiss, plaintiffs must allege a \nsubstantial burden on their religious exercise.  The statute \ndefines “religious exercise” broadly, as “any exercise of \nreligion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system \nof religious belief.”  42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb-2(4); 2000cc-5.  The \nRFRA does not define “substantial burden,” but because the RFRA \nintends to restore Sherbert and Yoder, those cases are \ninstructive in determining the meaning of that term.  In \nSherbert, plaintiff’s exercise of her religion was impermissibly \nburdened when plaintiff was forced “to choose between following \nthe precepts of her religion,” resting and not working on the \nSabbath and forfeiting certain unemployment benefits as a \nresult, or “abandoning one of the precepts of her religion in \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 16 of 45\norder to accept work.”  374 U.S. at 404.  In Yoder, the “impact \nof the compulsory [school] attendance law on respondents’ \npractice of the Amish religion [was found to be] not only \nsevere, but inescapable, for the Wisconsin law affirmatively \ncompels them, under threat of criminal sanction, to perform acts \nundeniably at odds with fundamental tenets of their religious \nbeliefs.”  406 U.S. at 218. \nThis Circuit also recently addressed the issue of \nsubstantial burden in the context of a RFRA challenge to the ACA \nin Gilardi.  The Gilardi brothers are the two owners of closely \nheld for-profit companies.   Their companies are not eligible \nfor the accommodations available to Priests for Life; the \nregulations require such companies to provide contraceptive \ncoverage for the participants and beneficiaries in their group \nhealth plans.  The Gilardis challenged the provisions of the \ncontraceptive mandate which would have required them to directly \nprovide contraceptive coverage to their employees, claiming it \nsubstantially burdened their religious beliefs opposing \ncontraception.  The Circuit agreed, finding that “the burden on \nreligious exercise . . . occurs when a company’s owners fill the \nbasket of goods and services that constitute a healthcare plan.  \nIn other words, the Gilardis are burdened when they are \npressured to choose between violating their religious beliefs in \nmanaging their selected plan or paying onerous penalties.”  733 \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 17 of 45\nF.3d at 1217.  “The contraceptive mandate,” as applied to \ncompanies not eligible for the accommodations, “demands that \nowners like the Gilardis meaningfully approve and endorse the \ninclusion of contraceptive coverage in their companies’ \nemployer-provided plans.”  Id. at 1217-18.   \nUnlike the Gilardis, Priests for Life is eligible for the \naccommodations to the mandate, and therefore is not required to \nprovide contraceptive services to its employees.  To take \nadvantage of the accommodations, Priests for Life will be \nrequired to provide its insurer with a self-certification form \nstating that it is a religious, non-profit organization which \nopposes providing coverage for some or all of any contraceptive \nservices required to be covered by the mandate.  78 Fed. Reg. at \n39,874, 39,892.3  Plaintiffs argue that the self-certification \n                                                            \n3 In addition, Priests for Life claims that it will be required \nto “identify its employees to its insurer for the distinct \npurpose of enabling and facilitating the government’s objective \nof promoting the use of contraceptive services;” Pls.’ Mot. for \nPrelim. Inj. at 7 (hereinafter “Pls.’ Mot.”); and “coordinate \nwith its insurer when adding or removing employees and \nbeneficiaries from its health care plan to ensure that these \nindividuals receive coverage for contraceptive services,” id. at \n8.  Plaintiffs provide no support for their claim that the \nchallenged regulations require either of these things, and \nadmitted at oral argument that Priests for Life must “identify” \nits employees to its insurer and “coordinate” with its insurer \nin order to provide its current health care plan to its \nemployees.  Priests for Life also suggests, without support, \nthat it will ultimately have to bear the costs of the \ncontraceptive services mandate, because the insurance companies \nwill somehow find a way to either raise premiums to cover the \ncost of such coverage, or fail to lower premiums to reflect the \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 18 of 45\nsubstantially burdens their exercise of religion because the \naccommodations require Priests for Life to “promote, facilitate \nand cooperate in the government’s immoral objective to increase \nthe use of contraceptive services in direct violation of \nPlaintiffs’ sincerely held religious beliefs.”  Pls.’ Mot. at 1.  \n“[B]ecause Priests for Life provides its employees with a health \ncare plan, the government mandate forces Priests for Life to \nprovide the means and mechanism by which contraception, \nsterilization, and abortifacients (and related education and \ncounseling) are provided to its employees (and beneficiaries), \nwhich is unacceptable to Plaintiffs because it violates their \nsincerely held religious beliefs.”  Id. at 9.  “This is true \nwhether the immoral services are paid for directly, indirectly, \nor even not at all by Priests for Life.” Id. at 15.  In sum, \nPlaintiffs alleges they are pressured to choose between \nviolating their religious beliefs by “support[ing] and \nprovid[ing] access to” the services provided under the \ncontraception mandate, or “leaving the health care insurance \nmarket altogether.” Id. at 16. \n                                                                                                                                                                                                \nsavings to the insurer by its provision of such coverage.  Pls.’ \nMot. at 9, n.6, 10, n.7.  The plain language of the regulations, \nhowever, prohibits insurers from passing along any costs of \ncontraceptive coverage to eligible organizations such as Priests \nfor Life, whether through cost-sharing, premiums, fees, or other \ncharges.  78 Fed. Reg. at 39,875-77.  The Court declines, \ntherefore, to find a substantial burden exists on any of these \ngrounds. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 19 of 45\nDefendants do not question the sincerity of Plaintiffs’ \nreligious beliefs, but they do dispute whether the \naccommodations impose a substantial burden on the exercise of \nthose beliefs.  Defendants argue that the regulations impose no \nmore than a de minimis burden on Plaintiffs’ religious exercise \nbecause the regulations “do not require Priests for Life to \n“modify [its] religious behavior in any way.”” Defs.’ Mot. at 15 \n(quoting Kaemmerling v. Lappin, 553 F.3d 669, 679 (D.C. Cir. \n2008)).  Defendants contend that Priests for Life “is not \nrequired to contract, arrange, pay or refer for contraceptive \ncoverage . . .  Priests for Life need not do anything more than \nit did prior to the promulgation of the challenged regulations – \nthat is, to inform its issuer that it objects to providing \ncontraceptive coverage in order to insure that it is not \nresponsible for contracting, arranging, paying or referring for \nsuch coverage.”  Id. at 14-15.  The self-certification form only \n“require[s] [Priests for Life] to inform its issuer that it \nobjects to providing contraceptive coverage, which it has done . \n. . voluntarily anyway even absent these regulations” in order \nto insure that it does not provide such coverage.  Id. 15-16.   \nAccordingly, Defendants argue that completing the self-\ncertification form “is at most, de minimis, and thus cannot be \n“substantial” under RFRA.”  Id. 17.  For the reasons set forth \nbelow, the Court agrees with the government. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 20 of 45\nA substantial burden exists when government action puts \n“substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and \nviolate his beliefs.”  Gilardi, 733 F.3d at 1216 (quoting \nKaemmerling, 553 F.3d at 678); see also Yoder, 406 U.S. at 218 \n(law substantially burdens the exercise of religion if it \ncompels individuals “to perform acts undeniably at odds with \nfundamental tenets of their religious beliefs.”)  “An \ninconsequential or de minimis burden on religious practice does \nnot rise to this level[.]”  Kaemmerling, 553 F.3d at 678.  \nFinally, an adherent is not substantially burdened by laws \nrequiring third parties to conduct their internal affairs in \nways that violate his beliefs.  Id. at 679. \nIn Kaemmerling, a federal prisoner claimed that the \nstatutorily mandated collection and use of his DNA for purposes \nof a national law enforcement database substantially burdened \nhis free exercise rights.  Kaemmerling alleged that the \ncollection, storage, and use of his DNA violated his sincerely \nheld religious beliefs.  The D.C. Circuit “accept[ed] as true \nthe factual allegations that Kaemmerling’s beliefs are sincere \nand of a religious nature,” 553 F.3d at 679.  The Court further \nnoted that the government commanded compliance with the statute; \nfailure to cooperate with collection of a fluid sample from \nwhich the DNA would be isolated is a misdemeanor offense.  Id. \nat 673.   Nevertheless, the Court rejected his RFRA claim \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 21 of 45\nbecause the government was not forcing him to modify his own \nbehavior.  The Court explained:   \nKaemmerling does not allege facts sufficient to state a \nsubstantial burden . . . because he cannot identify any \n“exercise” which is the subject of the burden to which he \nobjects.  The extraction and storage of DNA information are \nentirely the activities of the FBI, in which Kaemmerling \nplays no role and which occur after the [prison] has taken \nhis fluid or tissue sample (to which he does not object).  \nThe government’s extraction, analysis, and storage of \nKaemmerling’s DNA information does not call for Kaemmerling \nto modify his religious behavior in any way – it involves \nno action or forbearance on his part, nor does it otherwise \ninterfere with any religious act in which he engages.  \nAlthough the government’s activities with his fluid or \ntissue sample after the [prison] takes it may offend \nKaemmerling’s religious beliefs, they cannot be said to \nhamper his religious exercise because they do not “pressure \n[him] to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.”  \nThomas v. Review Bd., 450 U.S. 707, 718 (1981). \n \nKaemmerling alleges no religious observance that the DNA \nAct impedes, or acts in violation of his religious beliefs \nthat it pressures him to perform. Religious exercise \nnecessarily involves an action or practice, as in Sherbert, \nwhere the denial of unemployment benefits “impede[d] the \nobservance” of the plaintiff's religion by pressuring her \nto work on Saturday in violation of the tenets of her \nreligion, 374 U.S. at 404, or in Yoder, where the \ncompulsory education law compelled the Amish to “perform \nacts undeniably at odds with fundamental tenets of their \nreligious beliefs,” 406 U.S. at 218.  Kaemmerling, in \ncontrast, alleges that the DNA Act’s requirement that the \nfederal government collect and store his DNA information \nrequires the government to act in ways that violate his \nreligious beliefs, but he suggests no way in which these \ngovernmental acts pressure him to modify his own behavior \nin any way that would violate his beliefs. See Appellant's \nBr. at 21 (describing alleged substantial burden as \n“knowing [his] strongly held beliefs had been violated by \na[n] unholy act of an oppressive regime”). \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 22 of 45\n553 F.3d at 679.4  The Kaemmerling court relied on Bowen v. Roy, \nin which a Native American man objected to the states’ use of \nhis child’s Social Security number in determining eligibility \nfor welfare benefits.  The parents objected to a statutory \nrequirement that state agencies “shall utilize” Social Security \nnumbers “not because it place[d] any restriction on what [the \nfather] may believe or what he may do, but because he believes \nthe use of the number,” a governmental act, “may harm his \ndaughter’s spirit.”  476 U.S. 693, 699 (1986).  The Supreme \nCourt concluded that the government’s use of the child’s Social \nSecurity number did not impair her parents’ freedom to exercise \ntheir religion. \nNever to our knowledge has the Court interpreted the First \nAmendment to require the Government itself to behave in \nways that the individual believes will further his or her \nspiritual development or that of his or her family.  The \nFree Exercise clause simply cannot be understood to require \nthe Government to conduct its own internal affairs in ways \n                                                            \n4 Other Circuits have also emphasized the requirement that an \nadherent be pressured to modify his own conduct in order to show \na substantial burden on religious exercise.  See, e.g., Navajo \nNation v. U.S. Forest Serv., 535 F.3d 1058, 1067 (9th Cir. 2008) \n(en banc) (to establish a substantial burden under RFRA, \ngovernmental action must “coerce the Plaintiffs to act contrary \nto their religious beliefs under the threat of sanctions, [or] \ncondition a governmental benefit upon conduct that would violate \ntheir religious beliefs.”); Civil Liberties for Urban Believers \nv. City of Chicago, 342 F.3d 752, 761 (7th Cir. 2003) (“within \nthe meaning of RFRA, a substantial burden on religious exercise \nis one that forces adherents of a religion to refrain from \nreligiously motivated conduct, inhibits or constrains conduct or \nexpression that manifests a central tenet of a person’s \nreligious beliefs, or compels conduct or expression that is \ncontrary to these beliefs.”) (internal citation omitted). \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 23 of 45\nthat comport with the religious beliefs of particular \ncitizens. . . . [A]ppellees may not demand that the \nGovernment join in their chosen religious preferences by \nrefraining from using a number to identify their daughter. \nId. at 699-700.  Other Supreme Court decisions have similarly \nrejected free exercise challenges to laws which would not \nrequire a plaintiff to modify his own behavior, but would permit \na third party to engage in behavior to which the plaintiff \nobjects on religious grounds.  In Lyng, the Court rejected \nNative American tribes’ challenge to government building roads \nand harvesting timber on national forest land used by the tribes \nfor religious purposes.  The Court explained “government \nprograms, which may make it more difficult to practice certain \nreligions but which have no tendency to coerce individuals into \nacting contrary to their religious beliefs,” do not violate the \nFirst Amendment.  485 U.S. 439, 450 (1988).  “The Free Exercise \nClause is written in terms of what the government cannot do to \nthe individual, not in terms of what the individual can exact \nfrom the government . . . ”  Id. at 451 (quoting Sherbert, 374 \nU.S. at 412 (Douglas, J., concurring)). \nIn this case, the Court does not doubt the sincerity of \nPlaintiffs’ beliefs, nor does it doubt that condemnation of \ncontraception is central to their exercise of the Catholic \nreligion.  “It is not within the judicial ken to question the \ncentrality of particular beliefs or practices to a faith, or the \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 24 of 45\nvalidity of particular litigants’ interpretation of those \ncreeds.”  Hernandez v. Comm’r of Internal Revenue Serv., 490 \nU.S. 680, 699 (1989).  However, to prevail under the substantial \nburden test Plaintiffs must show more than a governmental action \nthat violates their sincerely held religious beliefs; they must \nshow that the governmental action forces Priests for Life, \nitself, to modify its own behavior in violation of those \nbeliefs.  Kaemmerling, 553 F.3d at 679.5  This is where \nPlaintiffs’ RFRA challenge must fail--like the challenges in \nKaemmerling and Bowen, the accommodations to the contraceptive \nmandate simply do not require Plaintiffs to modify their \nreligious behavior.  The accommodation specifically ensures that \nprovision of contraceptive services is entirely the activity of \n                                                            \n5 For this reason, inter alia, the Court is not persuaded by the \nrationale articulated in two recent cases that a plaintiff can \nmeet his burden of establishing that the accommodation creates a \n“substantial burden” upon his exercise of religion simply \nbecause he claims it to be so.  See Roman Catholic Archdiocese \nof N.Y. v. Sebelius, No. 12-2542, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176432, \n*44 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 13, 2013) (stating that plaintiffs “consider \n[completing the self-certification] to be an endorsement of \n[contraceptive services] coverage to which they object; to them, \nthe self-certification compels affirmation of a repugnant \nbelief.  It is not for this Court to say otherwise.”); see also \nZubik v. Sebelius, No. 13-1459, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165922, \n*79-*82 (W.D. Pa. Nov. 21, 2013) (reaching the same conclusion).  \nIn this Court’s view, those opinions misconceive RFRA’s \nsubstantial burden test, which requires courts to “accept as \ntrue the factual allegations that [a plaintiff’s] beliefs are \nsincere and of a religious nature – but not the legal \nconclusion, cast as a factual allegation, that his religious \nexercise is substantially burdened.” Kaemmerling, 553 F.3d at \n679. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 25 of 45\na third party – namely, the issuer – and Priests for Life plays \nno role in that activity.  As in Kaemmerling, “[a]lthough the \n[third party]’s activities . . . may offend [plaintiff’s] \nreligious beliefs, they cannot be said to hamper [his] religious \nexercise.”  553 F.3d at 679. \nPriests for Life attempts to distinguish Kaemmerling on the \ngrounds that Mr. Kaemmerling did not object to the government \ntaking his fluid, hair, or tissue samples; he only objected to \nthe subsequent extraction and storage of his DNA.  Priests for \nLife claims that in this case, “the coverage for the morally \nobjectionable contraceptive coverage will occur only because \nPriests for Life has played an active role in purchasing a \nhealthcare plan and then authorizing the issuer of its plan \nthrough “self-certification” to provide the objectionable \ncoverage directly to its plan participants and beneficiaries (a \nrole that is prohibited by Plaintiffs’ religion) and thereby \ncooperating with and thus facilitating the government’s illicit \nobjective “to increase access to and utilization of” \ncontraceptive services (cooperation that is prohibited by \nPlaintiffs’ religion).”  Pls.’ Combined Opp’n to Govt’s \nMot./Reply in Support of Pls.’ Mot. (hereinafter “Pls.’ \nOpp’n/Reply”) at 23 (emphasis in original).  The Court does not \nfind this distinction to be meaningful.  The governmental action \nin Kaemmerling could not have occurred without the plaintiff \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 26 of 45\nplaying an active role by providing a blood sample.  \nNevertheless, the court rejected claims that his action \nconstituted a substantial burden because the action did not, in \nand of itself, violate plaintiff’s religious beliefs.  The fact \nthat government action thereafter was deeply offensive to his \nbeliefs did not give rise to a RFRA claim. See Kaemmerling, 553 \nF.3d at 679 (plaintiff’s knowledge that his “strongly held \nbeliefs had been violated by a[n] unholy act of an oppressive \nregime” was not enough to violate the RFRA because the \ngovernment’s actions do not “pressure him to modify his own \nbehavior in any way that would violate his beliefs.”); see also \nBowen, 476 U.S. at 699-700 (rejecting plaintiff’s challenge to \nthe government’s use of his daughter’s Social Security number \nbecause it “may harm his daughter’s spirit. . . . The Free \nExercise Clause affords an individual protection from certain \nforms of governmental compulsion; it does not afford an \nindividual a right to dictate the conduct of the Government’s \ninternal procedures.”) \nIn this case, Plaintiffs assert an objection to a single \nrequirement the regulations impose on Priests for Life directly: \ncompleting a self-certification form stating that it is a non-\nprofit religious organization which objects to providing \ncontraceptive services coverage.  Pls.’ Mot. at 7.  However, \nduring oral argument Plaintiffs conceded that they have no \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 27 of 45\nreligious objection to the self-certification form, in and of \nitself.  Rather, Plaintiffs’ act under the accommodations \nbecomes burdensome only when it is characterized as \n“cooperating” with or providing “authorization” for “the \ngovernment’s illicit goal of increasing access to and \nutilization of contraceptive services.”  Pls.’ Opp’n/Reply at \n23.  But no matter how religiously offensive the statutory or \nregulatory objective may be, the law does not violate RFRA \nunless it coerces individuals into acting contrary to their \nreligious beliefs. See Lyng, 458 U.S. at 450.  In this case, it \nis only the subsequent actions of third parties – the \ngovernment’s and the issuer’s provision of contraceptive \nservices, in which Priests for Life plays no role – that animate \nits religious objections.  Under Bowen and Kaemmerling, however, \nRFRA does not permit Plaintiffs to proscribe the conduct of \nothers. \nPlaintiffs’ reliance on Sherbert, Yoder, and Thomas is \nunavailing.  Pls.’ Mot. at 21.  Plaintiffs argue that these \ncases, particularly Thomas, established that the impact of a \n“substantial burden” need not be direct.  Id. at 20.  In each of \nthese cases, however, the burdens of the governmental action – \ndenial of unemployment benefits for refusal to work on the \nSabbath or in an armaments factory, threatened criminal \nprosecution for refusing to send children to school – all fell \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 28 of 45\ndirectly upon the plaintiffs’ participation in or abstention \nfrom a specific religious practice.  That is not the case here; \nonce again, the only action required of Priests for Life under \nthe accommodations is consistent with its beliefs.  It is only \nthe independent actions of third parties which result in the \navailability of contraceptive services.  See Conestoga Wood \nSpecialties Corp. v. Sebelius, 917 F. Supp. 2d 394, 415 & n.15 \n(E.D. Pa. 2013) (explaining that while an indirect compulsion \nmay constitute a substantial burden, legislation which imposes \nonly an indirect burden on the exercise of religion does not), \naff’d 724 F.3d 377 (3d Cir. 2013), cert. granted, 2013 U.S. \nLEXIS 8418 (U.S. Nov. 26, 2013) (No. 13-354).6 \nThis Circuit’s recent decision in Gilardi does not alter \nthe analysis.  In Gilardi, the plaintiffs themselves (through \n                                                            \n6 The Court is not persuaded by the rationale in Archdiocese \nof N.Y., which states that completing the self-certification \nform, itself, amounts to a substantial burden on the plaintiffs’ \nexercise of religion, because if they do not complete the form, \nthey are subject to penalties or other forms of government \ncoercion.  See, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of N.Y., 2013 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 176432, *32 (stating that RFRA’s “substantial \nburden” test is met by a finding that plaintiffs face \n“substantial pressure” to comply with the law.)  The Court \nagrees with the reasoning of Kaemmerling, which, in the Court’s \nview, correctly interpreted Sherbert, Yoder and Thomas to hold \nthat even a threat of criminal sanction did not amount to a \nsubstantial burden when it did not impact plaintiff’s religious \nexercise. Kaemmerling, 553 F.3d at 679 (“Although the [third \nparty]’s activities . . . may offend [plaintiff’s] religious \nbeliefs, they cannot be said to hamper [his] religious \nexercise.”)  \n \n \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 29 of 45\ntheir companies) had to provide contraceptive coverage for the \nparticipants and beneficiaries of their plan.  The Circuit \nexplained that the Gilardis were substantially burdened when \nthey had to place contraceptive coverage into “the basket of \ngoods and services that constitute [their companies’] healthcare \nplan.”  Gilardi, 733 F.3d at 1218.  The Circuit repeated the \nnature of the burden later in the opinion, defining the burden \nas a “demand[] that owners like the Gilardis meaningfully \napprove and endorse the inclusion of contraceptive coverage in \ntheir companies’ employer-provided plans, over whatever \nobjections they may have.  Such an endorsement . . . is a \n“compel[led] affirmation of a repugnant belief.””  Id. at 1218 \n(quoting Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 402).  Priests for Life need do \nnone of those things.  It need not place contraceptive coverage \ninto “the basket of goods and services that constitute its \nhealthcare plan,” nor must it even permit, much less “approve \nand endorse” such coverage in its plan.  Gilardi, 733 F.3d at \n1217.  On the contrary, Priests for Life need only reaffirm its \nreligiously based opposition to providing contraceptive \ncoverage, at which point third parties will provide the coverage \nseparate and apart from Priests For Life’s plan of benefits.  In \nthe Court’s view, the Circuit’s holding on the issue of \nsubstantial burden in Gilardi is distinguishable from this case. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 30 of 45\n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiffs \nhave not stated a prima facie case under RFRA because they have \nnot alleged a substantial burden on their religious exercise.  \nTherefore, Count II of the Complaint will be dismissed for \nfailure to state a claim. \nC.

The right of free exercise protected by the \nFirst Amendment “does not relieve an individual of the \nobligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general \napplicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or \nprescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or \nproscribes).”  Employment Div. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 879 \n(1990) (quotation omitted).  A law is not neutral “if the object \nof [the] law is to infringe upon or restrict practices because \nof their religious motivation.” Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of \nHialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 533 (1993).  A law is not generally \napplicable if it “in a selective manner impose[s] burdens only \non conduct motivated by religious beliefs.”  Id. at 543. \n  This Court agrees with the vast majority of courts which \nhave considered the issue and found that the contraceptive \nservices regulations are neutral and generally applicable, and \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 31 of 45\naccordingly have rejected Free Exercise Clause challenges.  See \nDefs.’ Mot. at 32 n.5 (citing, e.g., MK Chambers Co. v. U.S. \nDep’t of Health & Human Servs., U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47887, *13-15 \nCase No. 13-11379 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 3, 2013); Conestoga, 917 F. \nSupp. 2d at 409-10; Autocam Corp. v. Sebelius, 2012 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 184093, *23, Case No. 12-1906 (W.D. Mich., Dec. 24, 2012), \naff’d 730 F.3d 618 (6th Cir. 2013), petition for cert. filed, \n(U.S. Oct. 15, 2013) (No. 13-482); Hobby Lobby, 870 F. Supp. 2d \n1278, 1289-90 (W.D. Okl. 2012) rev’d on other grounds, 723 F.3d \n1114).  Although these cases do not specifically address the \naccommodations to the mandate at issue here, nothing about the \nspecific regulations governing the accommodations leads to a \ndifferent result.   \nPlaintiffs do not dispute that the regulations’ stated \npurpose is secular: to promote public health and gender \nequality.  Nevertheless, they argue that the mandate, and its \naccommodations, is not neutral because it was “designed to \ntarget employers who refuse to provide contraceptive services to \ntheir employees based on the employers’ religious beliefs.”  \nPls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj. 23-24.  They cite the exemption for \n“religious employers” as defined by 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a), \nwhich applies only to houses of worship and their integrated \nauxiliaries, but not to other religious organizations, and argue \nthat the exemption divides religious objectors into favored and \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 32 of 45\ndisfavored groups without any secular purpose.  Pls.’ Mot. at \n24. \nAs several other courts considering the issue have found, \n“carving out an exemption for defined religious entities does \nnot make a law nonneutral as to others.”  Hobby Lobby, 870 F. \nSupp. 2d at 1289 (W.D. Okl. 2012).  In other words, the neutral \npurpose of the regulations – to make contraceptive coverage \navailable to women – is not altered because the legislature \nchose to exempt some religious institutions and not others.  On \nthe contrary, “the religious employer exemption presents a \nstrong argument in favor of neutrality, demonstrating that the \n“object of the law” was not to “infringe upon or restrict \npractices because of their religious motivation.””  O’Brien v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 894 F. Supp. 2d 1149, 1161 \n(E.D. Mo. 2012) (quoting Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 533); see also \nCatholic Charities of Diocese of Albany v. Serio, 7 N.E.2d 510, \n522 (N.Y. 2006), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 816 (2007) (rejecting \nFree Exercise Clause challenge to state law requiring \ncontraceptive coverage on grounds that the law exempted some, \nbut not all, religious institutions.  “To hold that any \nreligious exemption that is not all-inclusive renders a statute \nnon-neutral would be to discourage the enactment of any such \nexemptions—and thus to restrict, rather than promote, freedom of \nreligion.”).  Indeed, Priests for Life itself is the beneficiary \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 33 of 45\nof an accommodation to the regulations, which was enacted for \nthe purpose of alleviating any burden on its religious practice. \nPlaintiffs argue that a statement in the Overview of the \nFinal Regulations authorizing the religious employer exemption \nfrom the mandate reveals a discriminatory intent toward all \nemployers which oppose contraceptive coverage and which do not \nqualify for the exemption.   \nA group health plan . . . qualifies for the [religious \nemployer] exemption if, among other qualifications, the \nplan is established and maintained by an employer that \nprimarily employs persons who share the religious tenets of \nthat organization . . . .  Employers that do not primarily \nemploy employees who share the religious tenets of the \norganization are more likely to employ individuals who have \nno religious objection to the use of contraceptive services \nand therefore are more likely to use contraceptives. \nIncluding these employers within the scope of the exemption \nwould subject their employees to the religious views of the \nemployer, limiting access to contraceptives, and thereby \ninhibiting the use of contraceptive services and the \nbenefits of preventive care. \n \nPls.’ Mot. at 5, 24 (quoting 77 Fed. Reg. 8724, 8728).  For the \nreasons just discussed, this comment lacks significance in the \ncontext of a Free Exercise Clause claim.  It merely explains \nthat the regulations confer the special benefit of an exemption \nonly for those religious organizations that are essentially \nhouses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries, and who \ntherefore may be permitted to give employment preference to \nmembers of their own religion.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n1(a).  That benefit, as discussed above, “is justifiable as a \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 34 of 45\nlegislative accommodation--an effort to alleviate a \ngovernmentally imposed burden on religious exercise.”  Catholic \nCharities of Sacramento, Inc. v. Superior Court, 85 P.3d 67, 85 \n(Cal. 2004).  Those non-profit religious organizations that do \nnot qualify for the exemption but nevertheless are opposed to \ncontraceptive services, like Priests for Life, are also eligible \nfor an accommodation.  Finally, employers that do not qualify \nfor an exemption or accommodation are subject to the \ncontraceptive services mandate in the same manner as all other \nemployers, whether religious or non-religious.  Accordingly, \nwhile the regulations “treat some [] employers” with religious \nobjections to contraceptive coverage “more favorably than other \nemployers, it does not under any circumstance treat [employers \nwith religious objections] less favorably than any other \nemployers.”  85 P.3d at 85.  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ neutrality \nargument fails. \nPlaintiffs also claim that the law is not one of general \napplicability because “Congress has permitted exemptions from \nthe requirements of the Act,” including those for grandfathered \nplans and certain religious employers.  Pls.’ Mot. at 24.  The \nexistence of categorical exemptions, however, does not mean that \nthe law does not apply generally.  See, e.g., United States v. \nLee, 455 U.S. 252, 261 (1982) (finding social security tax \nrequirements generally applicable despite existence of \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 35 of 45\ncategorical exemptions).  As the Supreme Court has held, laws \nare not generally applicable when they “in a selective manner \nimpose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious beliefs.”  \nLukumi, 508 U.S. at 543 (invalidating statute which prohibited \nonly the religious practice of animal sacrifice, but not hunting \nor other secular practices involving killing of animals).  The \nregulations in this case do not impose burdens selectively; they \napply to all non-exempt employers, regardless of their religious \nbeliefs. See Stormans, Inc. v. Selecky, 586 F.3d 1109, 1134 (9th \nCir. 2009) (“pharmacists who do not have a religious objection \nto [filling prescriptions for contraceptives] must comply with \nthe rules to the same extent—no more and no less—than . . . \npharmacists who may have a religious objection to [filling the \nprescriptions].  Therefore, the rules are generally \napplicable.”)  And again, to the extent the accommodation alters \nthe analysis, it promotes, not restricts, the free exercise of \nreligion by excusing from compliance employers such as Priests \nfor Life due to their religious beliefs. \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that the regulations, and \nthe accommodations, do not violate the Free Exercise Clause.  \nTherefore, Count I of the Complaint will be dismissed for \nfailure to state a claim. \n \n \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 36 of 45\nD. Freedom of Speech and Expressive Association  \nPlaintiffs next argue that the accommodation to the \ncontraceptive services mandate violates their right to Free \nSpeech and Expressive Association under the First Amendment.  \nThey claim the accommodation compels speech, in violation of \ntheir deeply held religious beliefs, by requiring them to \ncomplete the self-certification form, which then leads to \nPriests for Life’s insurer providing contraceptive coverage.   \nPls.’ Mot. at 31.  They claim the same requirement violates \ntheir right to associate, which they do for the purpose of \nexpressing a “message that rejects the promotion and use of \ncontraceptive services.”  Id. at 29. \nAs Defendants point out, “every court to review a Free \nSpeech challenge to the prior contraceptive-coverage regulations \nhas rejected it.”  Defs.’ Mot. at 35 (citing, e.g., MK Chambers \nCo., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47887, *15-17; Conestoga, 917 F. \nSupp. 2d at 418; Autocam, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 184093, *23-\n*25).  These cases rely on Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic & \nInstitutional Rights, Inc., (“FAIR”), a case Plaintiffs do not \naddress.  In FAIR, the Court rejected a free speech and \nexpressive association challenge to the Solomon Amendment, a \nstatute that conditioned federal funding to law schools upon \ntheir agreement to permit military recruiters on campus.  The \nCourt found that the statute “neither limits what law schools \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 37 of 45\nmay say nor requires them to say anything.  Law schools remain \nfree . . . to express whatever views they may have on the \nmilitary . . . the [statute] regulates conduct – not speech.  It \naffects what law schools must do – afford access to military \nrecruiters – not what they may or may not say.”  FAIR, 547 U.S. \nat 60.  The Court found that to the extent that complying with \nthe Amendment required the school to speak, such as by sending \nemails or posting notices on behalf of military recruiters, such \nspeech was “plainly incidental to the . . . regulation of \nconduct.”  Id. at 62.  “It has never been deemed an abridgment \nof freedom of speech . . . to make a course of conduct illegal \nmerely because such conduct was in part initiated, evidenced, or \ncarried out by means of language, either spoken, written, or \nprinted.”  Id. (citation omitted).   \nA similar analysis applies to this case.  The regulations \nregarding contraceptive coverage, including the accommodation, \nplace no limits on what Plaintiffs may say; they remain free to \noppose contraceptive coverage for all people and in all forms.  \nRather, the accommodation regulates conduct; specifically, the \nconduct of Priests for Life’s insurance provider.  And like the \nlaw schools in FAIR, the only speech the accommodations require \nof Priests for Life is incidental to the regulation of conduct.  \nPriests for Life’s speech in this case is its self-certification \nthat it opposes contraceptive coverage.  This speech is \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 38 of 45\nnecessary only because it is attendant to the regulation of \nconduct, specifically, the insurance company’s provision of \ncontraceptive services.  Indeed, the speech at issue in this \ncase is even farther from a First Amendment violation than the \nspeech in FAIR; in that case, the speech was incidental to the \nlaw schools’ conduct, while in this case the speech is \nincidental to the conduct of a wholly separate entity.  And in \nany event, the speech at issue here is in accordance with \nPriests for Life’s religious beliefs, not fundamentally opposed \nto it.  Cf. West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 \n(1943) (invalidating state law requiring Jehovah’s Witness \nschoolchildren to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and to salute \nthe flag); Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705 (1977), (striking \ndown law that required Jehovah’s Witnesses to display the state \nmotto—“Live Free or Die”—on their license plates). \nPlaintiffs argue strenuously in their motion that because \nopposition to contraception is a fundamental part of their \norganizational message, any provision of contraceptive coverage \nby any other party must necessarily interfere with that message \nand therefore be considered compelled speech.  See Pls.’ Mot. at \n28-32.  But this is not the test for compelled speech in \nviolation of the First Amendment.  As the Court held in FAIR, \none speaker who is forced to host another speaker’s message may \nonly assert a compelled-speech violation when the message it is \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 39 of 45\nforced to host is “inherently expressive.”  FAIR, 547 U.S. at \n64.  For example, the “expressive nature of a parade” was a key \npart of the holding in Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, \nand Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U.S. 557, 568 (1995).  \nLikewise, in Pacific Gas and Electric Company v. Public Utility \nCommission of California, 475 U.S. 1 (1986), the compelled \ninclusion of a third party newsletter along with Pacific Gas’s \nown newsletter “interfered with the utility’s ability to \ncommunicate its own message in its newsletter.”  FAIR, 547 U.S. \nat 64.  By contrast, there is nothing inherently expressive \nabout Priests For Life’s insurer, wholly separate from Priests \nfor Life, providing contraceptive coverage, just as there is \nnothing inherently expressive about a law school’s decision to \nallow recruiters on campus.  Id., see also Autocam Corp. v. \nSebelius, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 184093, *23.7     \n                                                            \n7 Priests for Life also argues that the ACA’s requirement \nthat contraceptive coverage include patient education and \ncounseling for women constitutes prohibited speech because it \nadvocates a particular viewpoint or content. See Pls.’ \nOpp’n/Reply at 28.  This Court agrees with the Conestoga court, \nwhich considered and rejected the same argument, explaining, \n“[w]hile the regulations mandate that [insurance companies] \nprovide coverage for “education and counseling for women with \nreproductive capacity,” which may include information about the \ncontraceptives which Plaintiffs believe to be immoral, they are \nsilent with respect to the content of the counseling given to a \npatient by her doctor. . . .  As such, it cannot be said that \nPlaintiffs are being required to [host] the advocacy of a \nviewpoint with which they disagree.  Plaintiffs’ concern that a \ndoctor may, in some instances, provide advice to a patient that \ndiffers from [plaintiffs’] religious beliefs is not one \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 40 of 45\nPlaintiffs’ expressive association claim is also devoid of \nmerit.  The government violates expressive association rights \nunder the First Amendment by directly interfering with an \nassociation’s composition by forcing them to accept members or \nhire employees who would “significantly affect [the \nassociation’s] expression,” Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 \nU.S. 640, 656 (2000).  It may also infringe on the freedom of \nexpressive association by passing laws requiring disclosure of \nanonymous membership lists, or imposing penalties or withholding \nbenefits based on membership in a disfavored group.  Brown v. \nSocialist Workers ’74 Campaign Comm., 459 U.S. 87, 101-02 \n(1982); Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 180-84 (1972).  These laws \nwere invalidated because they “made group membership less \nattractive, raising [] First Amendment concerns affecting the \ngroup’s ability to express its message.”  FAIR, 547 U.S. at 69.   \nBy contrast, the presence of military recruiters on a law school \ncampus “has no similar effect on a law school’s associational \nrights.  Students and faculty are free to associate to voice \ntheir disapproval of the military’s message; nothing about the \nstatute affects the composition of the group by making group \nmembership less desirable. . . . A military recruiter’s mere \n                                                                                                                                                                                                \nprotected by the First Amendment.”  Conestoga, 917 F. Supp. 2d \nat 419 (internal citations omitted). \n \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 41 of 45\npresence on campus does not violate a law school’s right to \nassociate, regardless of how repugnant the law school considers \nthe recruiter’s message.”  Id. at 69-70. \nAs in FAIR, the regulations and accommodations do not \nviolate Plaintiffs’ right to associate.  The regulations and \naccommodations in no way restrict Priests for Life’s members, \nemployees, and donors from associating to express their \nopposition to contraception.  Nothing about the regulations or \nthe accommodations force Plaintiffs to accept members or \nemployees it does not desire, nor do they make group membership \nless desirable as in Socialist Workers ’74 or in Healy.  Like \nthe plaintiffs in FAIR, there can be no doubt that Plaintiffs \nfind the content of the regulations repugnant to their religious \nbeliefs.  See Compl. at ¶¶ 87-8, 90 (explaining its beliefs that \naccess to contraception “harms women,” is “gravely immoral,” and \n“a grave sin.”).  However, the fact that a third party provides \ncontraceptive coverage to Priests for Life’s employees, separate \nfrom Priests for Life or its employer-sponsored health plan, \ndoes not affect the group’s ability to express its message under \nthe First Amendment, and therefore does not violate its \nassociational rights. \nThe government has not compelled plaintiffs to speak, nor \nhas it violated their rights to expressive association.  \nAccordingly, Count III of the Complaint will be dismissed. \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 42 of 45\nE. Establishment Clause and Equal Protection Clause \nThe Establishment Clause prohibits the government from \nshowing a preference for any religious denomination over \nanother.  Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 244 (1982).  \nPlaintiffs claim that the contraceptive services mandate, its \nexemption for religious employers, and its accommodations create \nan impermissible government preference in favor of churches and \nreligious orders over other religious organizations.  Pls.’ \nOpp’n/Reply at 29-30.  As with Plaintiffs’ Free Speech/ \nExpressive Association Claim, defendants point out that every \ncourt to consider an Establishment Clause challenge to the \ncontraceptive services mandate has rejected it.  Defs.’ Mot. at \n39 (citing, e.g., O’Brien, 894 F. Supp. 2d at 1162; Conestoga, \n917 F. Supp. 2d  at 416-17).  As these courts found, the \nregulations permit the government to distinguish between \nreligious organizations based on structure and purpose when \ngranting religious accommodations, which is not prohibited under \nthe Establishment Clause.  See, e.g., O’Brien, 894 F. Supp. 2d \nat 1163-4 (collecting cases).8 \n                                                            \n8 Plaintiffs claim that under Larson, the government is \nprohibited from making other distinctions among types of \nreligious institutions, in addition to denominational \npreferences.  Pls.’ Opp’n/Reply at 31-32.  Plaintiffs misread \nLarson.  The Larson court invalidated the statute at issue not \nbecause it distinguished between different types of \norganizations based on their structure or purpose, but rather \nbecause it “was drafted with the explicit intention of including \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 43 of 45\nPlaintiffs do not address this authority. The crux of their \nargument rests on a statement in the Overview of the Final \nRegulations authorizing the religious employer exemption from \nthe mandate, which states in relevant part:   \nA group health plan . . . qualifies for the [religious \nemployer] exemption if, among other qualifications, the \nplan is established and maintained by an employer that \nprimarily employs persons who share the religious tenets of \nthat organization .  . . .   Employers that do not \nprimarily employ employees who share the religious tenets \nof the organization are more likely to employ individuals \nwho have no religious objection to the use of contraceptive \nservices and therefore are more likely to use \ncontraceptives. Including these employers within the scope \nof the exemption would subject their employees to the \nreligious views of the employer, limiting access to \ncontraceptives, and thereby inhibiting the use of \ncontraceptive services and the benefits of preventive care. \n \n \nPls.’ Mot. at 35 (quoting 77 Fed. Reg. at 8728); Pls.’ \nOpp’n/Reply at 33 (same).   The Court has already considered \nthis statement in the context of Plaintiffs’ Free Exercise \nClause challenge and found it constitutionally permissible.  See \nsupra at III.C.  Nor does it violate the Establishment Clause, \nbecause it delineates the contours of a religious accommodation \nthat applies equally to organizations of every faith and does \nnot favor any denomination over another.  See, e.g., Walz v. Tax \nComm’n of City of New York, 397 U.S. 664 (1970) (rejecting \nEstablishment Clause challenge to law exempting from property \n                                                                                                                                                                                                \nparticular religious denominations and excluding others.”  456 \nU.S. at 254.   \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 44 of 45\ntaxes property of religious organizations used exclusively for \nreligious worship); Droz v. Comm’r of IRS, 48 F.3d 1120, 1124 \n(9th Cir. 1995) (upholding Social Security tax exemption only \nfor members of organized religious sects, despite the fact that \n“some individuals receive exemptions, and other individuals with \nidentical beliefs do not,” because the purpose of the exemption \nwas not to discriminate among religious denominations).   \nPlaintiffs’ Equal Protection claim is identical to its \nother First Amendment Claims:  they claim the regulations, \nreligious employer exemption and accommodation impinge on \nPriests for Life’s fundamental right to free exercise of \nreligion, freedom of speech and expressive association.  Pls.’ \nMot. at 33.  The Court has already rejected these underlying \nclaims, however.  “Where a plaintiff’s First Amendment free \nexercise claim has failed, the Supreme Court has applied only \nrational basis scrutiny in its subsequent review of an equal \nprotection fundamental right to religious free exercise claim \nbased on the same facts.” Wirzburger v. Galvin, 412 F.3d 271, \n282-83 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S. 712, 721 \n(2004).  Applying rational basis scrutiny to the fundamental \nrights-based claim that the regulations violate equal \nprotection, the Court has no trouble determining that the \ncontraceptive services mandate is rationally related to the \nlegitimate government purposes of promoting public health and \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-01261-EGS   Document 36   Filed 12/19/13   Page 45 of 45\ngender equality.  See, e.g., Dep’t of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 \nU.S. 528, 533 (1973).  Indeed, Plaintiffs do not argue that the \nregulations would fail such review. \nThe Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under the \nEstablishment Clause or the Equal Protection Clause.  Therefore, \nCounts IV and V will be dismissed. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the defendants’ motion to \ndismiss all counts of Plaintiffs’ Complaint is GRANTED; \naccordingly, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment are \nDENIED AS MOOT.

Plaintiffs’  principal  claim  is  that  the \naccommodation does not go far enough.  They believe that, \neven  if  they  opted  out,  they  would  still  play  a  role  in \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 3 of 86\n3 \n \nfacilitating contraceptive coverage.  They view the regulation \nas thereby substantially burdening their religious exercise by \ninvolving  them  in  what  the  Plaintiffs  and  their  faith  call \n“scandal,” i.e., leading others to do evil.  Plaintiffs claim that \nthe government lacks a compelling interest in requiring them \nto use the specific accommodation the regulations authorize, \nmaking the burden unjustified and unlawful.  They contend \nthat  RFRA  gives  them  a  right  to  exclude  contraceptive \ncoverage from their employees’ and students’ plans without \nnotice, and requires that the government be enjoined from \nimplementing the contraceptive coverage requirement. \n \n*  *  * \n \nAs  a  consequence  of  a  period  of  wage  controls  after \nWorld War II during which employers created new fringe \nbenefits,  the  majority  of  people  in  the  United  States  with \nhealth  insurance  receive  it  under  plans  their  employers \narrange through the private market.  Congress chose in the \nACA not to displace that basic system.  It sought instead to \nexpand the number of Americans insured and to improve and \nsubsidize health insurance coverage, in part by building on \nthe  market-based  system  of  employer-sponsored  private \nhealth insurance already in place.  The contraceptive coverage \nrequirement and accommodation operate through that system.  \n \nThe regulations implementing the ACA and its Women’s \nHealth Amendment impose a range of standard requirements \non group health plans, including that they cover contraceptive \nservices  prescribed  by  a  health  care  provider  without \nimposing any cost sharing on the patient.  The contraceptive \ncoverage requirement derives from the ACA’s prioritization \nof preventive care, and from Congress’ recognition that such \ncare has often been modeled on men’s health needs and thus \nleft  women  underinsured.    As  discussed  below,  Congress \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 4 of 86\n4 \n \nincluded the Women’s Health Amendment in the ACA to \nremedy the problem that women were paying significantly \nmore out of pocket for preventive care and thus often failed to \nseek  preventive  services,  including  consultations, \nprescriptions, and procedures relating to contraception.  The \nmedical  evidence  prompting  the  contraceptive  coverage \nrequirement showed that even minor obstacles to obtaining \ncontraception led to more unplanned and risky pregnancies, \nwith attendant adverse effects on women and their families.  \n     \nSome  employers,  including  the  Catholic  nonprofits  in \nthis case, oppose contraception on religious grounds.  The \nCatholic  Church  teaches  that  contraception  violates  God’s \ndesign because the natural and non-sinful purpose of sex is to \nconceive a child within a marriage:  Plaintiff Priests for Life, \nquoting the Papal Encyclical Humanae Vitae, declares that \n“‘any action which either before, at the moment of, or after \nsexual  intercourse,  is  specifically  intended  to  prevent \nprocreation, whether as an end or as a means’—including \ncontraception and sterilization—is a grave sin.”  J.A. 49.  In \nthe view of the Catholic Church expressed through Humanae \nVitae,  contraception  enables  the  separation  of  sex  from \nreverence for the sexual partner, the understanding that sex \nmakes children, and the imperative of deep commitment to \nmarriage and family.   \n \nThe  Catholic  Church  itself  is  exempt  from  the \ncontraceptive coverage requirement, but Catholic nonprofits \nhave a long and broad history of service that goes far beyond \nworship  or  proselytizing.    Nationally,  Catholic  hospitals, \nclinics,  universities,  schools,  and  social  services  groups \nprovide  many  services  that  are  not  inherently  religious.  \nCatholic-identified nonprofits employ and enroll as students \nmillions of adults, not all of whom are co-religionists or share \nthe Catholic Church’s religious opposition to contraception.          \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 5 of 86\n5 \n \n \nFaced with an employer-based health insurance system, \nforceful  impetus  to  require  coverage  of  contraceptive \nservices,  and  religious  opposition  by  some  employers  to \ncontraception,  the  government  sought  to  accommodate \nreligious  objections.    As  detailed  below,  the  ACA’s \nimplementing regulations allow religious nonprofits to opt out \nof including contraception in the coverage they arrange for \ntheir  employees  and  students.    The  regulations  assure, \nhowever, that the legally mandated coverage is in place to \nseamlessly  provide  contraceptive  services  to  women  who \nwant them, for whom they are medically appropriate, and \nwho personally have no objection to using them.  \n \nThe  regulatory  opt  out  works  simply:    A  religious \norganization that objects on religious grounds to including \ncoverage for contraception in its health plan may so inform \neither the entity that issues or administers its group health \nplan  or  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services.  \nDelivery  of  the  requisite  notice  extinguishes  the  religious \norganization’s obligation to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for \nany coverage that includes contraception.  The regulations \nthen require group health plan insurers or administrators to \noffer separate coverage for contraceptive services directly to \ninsured women who want them, and to inform beneficiaries \nthat the objecting employer has no role in facilitating that \ncoverage. \n \nPlaintiffs,  the  Roman  Catholic  Archbishop  of \nWashington  and  nonprofits  affiliated  with  the  Catholic \nChurch,  arrange  for  group  health  coverage  for  their \nemployees  and  students.    Plaintiffs  oppose  the  ACA’s \ncontraceptive coverage requirement on religious grounds and \ndo not want to provide the requisite contraceptive coverage.  \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 6 of 86\n6 \n \nInstead of taking advantage of the accommodation, Plaintiffs \nfiled suit to challenge it as a violation of their religious rights.   \n \nPlaintiffs’ principal claim arises under RFRA.  Congress \nenacted RFRA in response to the Supreme Court’s decision in \nEmployment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), that the \nFree  Exercise  Clause  of  the  First  Amendment  “does  not \nrelieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid \nand neutral law of general applicability.”  Id. at 879 (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  Congress sought to reinstate as a \nstatutory matter the pre-Smith free exercise standard.  Under \nRFRA,  the  federal  government  may  not  “substantially \nburden” a person’s religious exercise—even where the burden \nresults from a religiously neutral, generally applicable law \nthat  is  constitutionally  valid  under  Smith—unless  the \nimposition of such a burden is the least restrictive means to \nserve a compelling governmental interest.  \n   \nThe  contraceptive  coverage  opt-out  mechanism \nsubstantially burdens Plaintiffs’ religious exercise, Plaintiffs \ncontend, by failing to extricate them from providing, paying \nfor, or facilitating access to contraception.  In particular, they \nassert  that  the  notice  they  submit  in  requesting \naccommodation  is  a  “trigger”  that  activates  substitute \ncoverage, and that the government will “hijack” their health \nplans and use them as “conduits” for providing contraceptive \ncoverage to their employees and students.  Plaintiffs dispute \nthat the government has any compelling interest in obliging \nthem to give notice of their wish to take advantage of the \naccommodation.  And they argue that the government has \nfailed  to  show  that  the  notice  requirement  is  the  least \nrestrictive means of serving any such interest.   \nWe  conclude  that  the  challenged  regulations  do  not \nimpose a substantial burden on Plaintiffs’ religious exercise \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 7 of 86\n7 \n \nunder RFRA.  All Plaintiffs must do to opt out is express \nwhat they believe and seek what they want via a letter or two-\npage form.  That bit of paperwork is more straightforward and \nminimal  than  many  that  are  staples  of  nonprofit \norganizations’  compliance  with  law  in  the  modern \nadministrative state.  Religious nonprofits that opt out are \nexcused  from  playing  any  role  in  the  provision  of \ncontraceptive  services,  and  they  remain  free  to  condemn \ncontraception in the clearest terms.  The ACA shifts to health \ninsurers  and  administrators  the  obligation  to  pay  for  and \nprovide  contraceptive  coverage  for  insured  persons  who \nwould  otherwise  lose  it  as  a  result  of  the  religious \naccommodation.   \n \nEven if, as Plaintiffs aver, we must take as dispositive \ntheir  conviction  that  the  accommodation  involves  them  in \nproviding  contraception  in  a  manner  that  substantially \nburdens  their  religious  exercise,  we  would  sustain  the \nchallenged regulations.  A confluence of compelling interests \nsupports  maintaining  seamless  application  of  contraceptive \ncoverage to insured individuals even as Plaintiffs are excused \nfrom providing it.  That coverage offers adults and children \nthe  benefits  of  planning  for  healthy  births  and  avoiding \nunwanted pregnancy, and it promotes preventive care that is \nas responsive to women’s health needs as it is to men’s.  The \naccommodation requires as little as it can from the objectors \nwhile  still  serving  the  government’s  compelling  interests.  \nBecause  the  regulatory  opt-out  mechanism  is  the  least \nrestrictive means to serve compelling governmental interests, \nit is fully consistent with Plaintiffs’ rights under RFRA.  We \nalso find no merit in Plaintiffs’ additional claims under the \nConstitution and the Administrative Procedure Act.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 8 of 86\n8 \n \nI.  Background \nA.  The ACA & Accommodation \nThe ACA requires group health plans, including both \ninsured  and  self-insured  employer-based  plans,  to  include \nminimum coverage for a variety of preventive health services \nwithout imposing cost-sharing requirements on the covered \nbeneficiary.1  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a); see also id. § 300gg-\n91(a)  (defining  “group  health  plan”);  45  C.F.R. \n§ 147.131(c)(2)(ii)  (cost-sharing  includes  copayments, \ncoinsurance,  and  deductibles).    In  view  of  the  greater \npreventive health care costs borne by women, the Women’s \nHealth Amendment in the ACA specifically requires coverage \nfor  women  of  “such  additional  preventive  care  and \nscreenings . . . as provided for in comprehensive guidelines \nsupported  by  the  Health  Resources  and  Services \nAdministration.”  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4). \nTo  determine  which  preventive  services  should  be \nrequired, the Health Resources and Services Administration \n(“HRSA”), a component of HHS, commissioned a study from \nthe independent Institute of Medicine (“IOM” or “Institute”).  \nThe Institute is an arm of the National Academy of Sciences \nestablished in 1970 to inform health policy with available \nscientific  information.    In  reliance  on  the  work  of  the \nInstitute,  HRSA  established  guidelines  for  women’s \n                                                 \n1 An employer “self-insures” if it bears the financial risk of paying \nits employees’ health insurance claims (as opposed to contracting \nwith  an  insurance  company  to  provide  coverage  and  bear  the \nassociated  financial  risk).    Many  “self-insured”  employers  hire \nthird-party  administrators  (“TPAs”)  to  perform  administrative \nfunctions, such as developing provider networks and processing \nclaims.    See  generally  Cong.  Budget  Office,  Key  Issues  in \nAnalyzing Major Health Insurance Proposals 6 (2008). \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 9 of 86\n9 \n \npreventive  services  that  include  any  “[FDA]  approved \ncontraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient \neducation  and  counseling.”    Health  Resources  &  Servs. \nAdmin.,  Women’s  Preventive  Services  Guidelines, \nhttp://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/,  quoted  in  77  Fed. \nReg. 8725, 8725 (Feb. 15, 2012).   \nThe  three  agencies  responsible  for  the  ACA’s \nimplementation—the  Department  of  Health  and  Human \nServices, the Department of Labor, and the Department of the \nTreasury  (collectively,  the  “Departments”)—issued \nregulations  requiring  coverage  of  all  preventive  services \ncontained in the HRSA guidelines, including contraceptive \nservices.  See 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv) (HHS); 29 C.F.R. \n§ 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv)  (Labor);  26  C.F.R.  § 54.9815-\n2713(a)(1)(iv) (Treasury).  The Departments determined that \ncontraceptives  prevent  unintended  pregnancies  and  the \nnegative health risks associated with such pregnancies; they \n“have medical benefits for women who are contraindicated \nfor  pregnancy,”  and  they  offer  “demonstrated  preventive \nhealth benefits . . . relating to conditions other than pregnancy \n. . . .”  77 Fed. Reg. at 8,727.  Inadequate coverage for women \nnot only fails to protect women’s health, but “places women \nin the workforce at a disadvantage compared to their male co-\nworkers.”  Id. at 8,728.  Providing contraceptive coverage \nwithin  the  preventive-care  package,  the  Departments \nobserved, supports the equal ability of women to be “healthy \nand productive members of the job force.”  Id.  Because of the \nimportance of such coverage, and because “[r]esearch . . . \nshows  that  cost  sharing  can  be  a  significant  barrier  to \neffective  contraception,”  the  Departments  included \ncontraceptive  coverage  among  the  services  to  be  provided \nwithout cost sharing.  Id.     \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 10 of 86\n10 \n \nObjections  by  religious  nonprofits  to  the  use  of \ncontraception,  and  to  arranging  health  insurance  for  their \nemployees that covers contraceptive services, prompted the \nDepartments to create two avenues for religious organizations \nto exclude themselves from any obligation to provide such \ncoverage.  Those avenues track a longstanding and familiar \ndistinction  between  houses  of  worship  (e.g.,  temples, \nmosques, or churches) and religious nonprofits (e.g., schools, \nhospitals, or social service agencies with a religious mission \nor  affiliation).    First,  in  order  to  “respect[]  the  unique \nrelationship between a house of worship and its employees in \nministerial  positions,”  the  Departments  categorically \nexempted “religious employers,” defined as churches or the \nexclusively religious activities of any religious order, from \nthe  contraceptive  coverage  requirement.2    76  Fed.  Reg. \n46,621, 46,623 (Aug. 3, 2011); see 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a).  \nSecond, the Departments created a mechanism for nonprofit \n“eligible organizations,” i.e., groups that are not houses of \nworship  but  nonetheless  present  themselves  as  having  a \nreligious character, to opt out of having to “contract, arrange, \npay, or refer for [contraceptive] coverage.”  78 Fed. Reg. \n39,870, 39,871 (July 2, 2013).  This opt-out mechanism was \ndesigned  to  dissociate  the  objecting  organizations  from \ncontraceptive  coverage  while  ensuring  that  the  individuals \ncovered under those organizations’ health plans—people not \nfairly  presumed  to  share  the  organizations’  opposition  to \n                                                 \n2 An organization qualifies as a “religious employer” under the \nregulations if it is “organized and operates as a nonprofit entity and \nis referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended.”  45 C.F.R. § 147.131(a).  \nThose  provisions,  in  turn,  refer  to  “churches,  their  integrated \nauxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches” and “the \nexclusively religious activities of any religious order.”   26 U.S.C. \n§ 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii).   \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 11 of 86\n11 \n \ncontraception or to be co-religionists—could obtain coverage \nfor  contraceptive  services  directly  through  separate  plans \nfrom the same plan providers.  See id. at 39,874.  Plaintiffs \nchallenge this second mechanism, which the regulations refer \nto as the “accommodation.”  \nThe government designed the accommodation to avoid \nencumbering  Plaintiffs’  sincere  religious  belief  that \nproviding, paying for, or facilitating insurance coverage for \ncontraceptives  violates  their  religion,  but  the  government \nsought at the same time to preserve unhindered access to \ncontraceptives for insured individuals who use them.  Many \nreligiously  affiliated  educational  institutions,  hospitals,  and \nsocial-service  organizations  have  taken  advantage  of  the \naccommodation,  and  courts  of  appeals  have  uniformly \nsustained  it  against  challenges  under  RFRA  and  the \nConstitution.  See Mich. Catholic Conf. & Catholic Family \nServs. v. Burwell, 755 F.3d 372 (6th Cir. 2014); Univ. of \nNotre Dame v. Sebelius, 743 F.3d 547 (7th Cir. 2014) petition \nfor cert. filed (Oct. 3, 2014) (No. 13-3853). \nB.  The Plaintiff Nonprofits Offer  \nHealth Insurance in Various Ways \n \nPlaintiffs are eleven Catholic organizations that employ \nboth  Catholics  and  non-Catholics  and  provide  a  range  of \nspiritual  and  charitable  services  in  the  Washington,  D.C. \narea.3  They fall into four categories that differ in ways that \naffect how the accommodation applies to them, and that are \nthus relevant to some aspects of our analysis. \n                                                 \n3 Father Frank Pavone, Alveda King, and Janet Morana, employees \nof Plaintiff Priests for Life, are also individually Plaintiffs in this \naction.  We refer to them, along with the organization, collectively \nas “Priests for Life” or the “Priests for Life Plaintiffs.” \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 12 of 86\n12 \n \nFirst,  the  Roman  Catholic  Archbishop  of  Washington \n(the “Archdiocese”), a corporation sole, is part of the Catholic \nChurch.  It provides pastoral care and spiritual guidance to \nnearly  600,000  Catholics.    It  is  undisputed  that  the \nArchdiocese  itself  is  a  religious  employer  and  thus  is \ncategorically  exempt  from  the  requirement  to  include \ncoverage for contraceptive services for its employees in its \nself-insured health plan.  The Archdiocese operates a self-\ninsured  health  plan  that  is  considered  a  “church  plan.”  \nChurch  plans  are  exempt  from  the  Employee  Retirement \nIncome  Security  Act  of  1974  (“ERISA”),  which  regulates \nprivate, employer-sponsored benefit plans, including health \ninsurance plans.  See 29 U.S.C. § 1002(33) (defining “church \nplan”);  id.  at  §  1003(b)(2)  (exempting  church  plans  from \nERISA); see generally id. § 1001 et seq. (governing employee \nbenefit plans).  The ACA amended ERISA by establishing \nnew requirements for large group health plans and insurers, \nbut the church’s provision of benefits to its employees via its \nchurch plan is exempt from ERISA, which distinguishes the \nArchdiocese’s claims here from those of the other Plaintiffs.  \nThe Archdiocese need not submit any written notice in order \nto be exempt, and the employees of the Archdiocese are not \nentitled  to  contraceptive  coverage  under  the  ACA.    The \nArchdiocese nonetheless participates as a Plaintiff in this case \nin its role as the sponsor of the church plan that some of the \nother  Plaintiffs  also  use  to  provide  insurance  to  their \nemployees—a role that the Archdiocese contends makes it \ncomplicit in providing them with contraceptive coverage. \nThe remaining Plaintiffs are all religious nonprofits.  It is \nundisputed that, under the government’s regulations, each is \neligible  for  the  accommodation,  but  not  the  exemption \nextended to houses of worship.    \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 13 of 86\n13 \n \nComprising the second of the four categories are the so-\ncalled “church-plan Plaintiffs,” nonprofits affiliated with the \nArchdiocese  that  provide  educational,  housing,  and  social \nservices to the community and arrange for health insurance \ncoverage for their employees through the Archdiocese’s self-\ninsured plan.4    \nPlaintiff  Thomas  Aquinas  College  falls  under  a  third \ncategory.  It also self-insures.  It offers its employees health \ninsurance coverage through an organization called the RETA \ntrust, which oversees an ERISA-covered plan set up by the \nCatholic  bishops  of  California  and  run  by  a  third-party \nadministrator (“TPA”).  The parties agree that the College’s \nplan is not exempt from ERISA as a church plan.   \nIn the fourth category are those Plaintiffs that provide \ninsurance coverage through group health insurance plans they \nnegotiate  with  private  insurance  companies.    Catholic \nUniversity  of  America  offers  its  students  and  employees \nhealth insurance through two separate group insurance plans \noffered by AETNA and United Healthcare.  Priests for Life, a \nreligious nonprofit that encourages clergy to emphasize the \nvalue  and  inviolability  of  human  life,  also  provides  its \nemployees with health insurance through a group insurance \nplan offered by United Healthcare.     \nIt is undisputed that Plaintiffs all sincerely believe that \nlife begins at conception and that contraception is contrary to \n                                                 \n4  The  church-plan  Plaintiffs  are  the  Consortium  of  Catholic \nAcademies of the Archdiocese of Washington, Archbishop Carroll \nHigh  School,  Inc.,  Don  Bosco  Cristo  Rey  High  School  of  the \nArchdiocese  of  Washington,  Inc.,  Mary  of  Nazareth  Roman \nCatholic  Elementary  School,  Inc.,  Catholic  Charities  of  the \nArchdiocese of Washington, Inc., Victory Housing, Inc., and the \nCatholic Information Center, Inc. \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 14 of 86\n14 \n \nCatholic tenets.5  Priests for Life, for example, was founded \nto spread the Gospel of Life, which “affirms and promotes the \nculture of life and actively opposes and rejects the culture of \ndeath.”    Pls.’  Br.  11.    Catholic  doctrine  prohibits \n“impermissible  cooperation  with  evil,”  and  thus  opposes \nproviding  access  to  “contraceptives,  sterilization,  and \nabortion-inducing  products,”  which  the  Church  views  as \n“immoral regardless of their cost.”  Id. at 12.  The specific \nacts to which Plaintiffs object are “provid[ing], pay[ing] for, \nand/or facilitat[ing] access to contraception,” any of which \nthey believe would violate the Catholic Church’s teachings.  \nId. at 15.   \nIn the past, in accordance with their religious beliefs, \nPlaintiffs  have  offered  health  care  coverage  to  their \nemployees6  that  excluded  coverage  for  “abortion-inducing \nproducts,  contraception  [except  when  used  for  non-\ncontraceptive purposes], sterilization, or related counseling.”  \nId. at 16.  They structured the coverage in a variety of ways, \nincluding through self-insured health plans and group health \nplans,  which  they  directed  to  exclude  all  contraceptive \nservices.    Plaintiffs  object  to  the  contraceptive  coverage \nrequirement  and  the  accommodation’s  opt-out  mechanism \nbecause, they assert, the accommodation fails adequately to \ndissociate them from the provision of contraceptive coverage \nand,  by  making  them  complicit  with  evil,  substantially \nburdens their religious exercise in violation of RFRA.  In \n                                                 \n5 For ease of reference, we refer to contraception, sterilization, and \nrelated  counseling  services  as  “contraception”  or “contraceptive \nservices.” \n6 Throughout this opinion we discuss Plaintiffs’ “employees.”  We \nuse  this  term  to  refer  to  all  individuals  covered  by  Plaintiffs’ \ninsurance  plans,  including  employees,  students,  and  other \nbeneficiaries, such as covered dependents. \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 15 of 86\n15 \n \nparticular, they contend that the regulations, by requiring the \nplans  or  TPAs  with  which  they  contract  to  provide  the \ncoverage, effectively require Plaintiffs to facilitate it. \nC.  Procedural History \nPlaintiffs brought two separate suits that proceeded on \nparallel tracks in district court. The Priests for Life Plaintiffs \nfiled their complaint in August 2013 and promptly moved for \na preliminary injunction.  They challenged the contraceptive \ncoverage  requirement  and  the  accommodation  as  an \nunjustified substantial burden on their religious exercise in \nviolation  of  RFRA  and  raised  a  variety  of  constitutional \nchallenges under the Speech and Religion Clauses of the First \nAmendment  and  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  Fifth \nAmendment.   \nThe  district  court  considered  Plaintiffs’  request  for  a \npreliminary injunction together with the merits, granted the \ngovernment’s motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to \nstate a claim, and denied as moot the parties’ cross-motions \nfor  summary  judgment.    Reasoning  that  “[t]he \naccommodation  specifically  ensures  that  provision  of \ncontraceptive  services  is  entirely  the  activity  of  a  third \nparty—namely the issuer—and Priests for Life plays no role \nin  that  activity,”  the  court  held  that  the  Priests  for  Life \nPlaintiffs failed to show a substantial burden on their religious \nexercise.  Priests for Life v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human \nServs., 7 F. Supp. 3d 88, 102 (D.D.C. 2013).  The court also \nrejected each of Priests for Life’s constitutional claims.  Id. at \n104-111.   \nThe  remaining  Plaintiffs—the  Archdiocese,  Thomas \nAquinas College, Catholic University of America, and the \nchurch-plan Plaintiffs (referred to collectively as the “RCAW \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 16 of 86\n16 \n \nPlaintiffs”)—filed  their  complaint  and  moved  for  a \npreliminary  injunction  in  September  2013,  challenging  the \naccommodation under RFRA and the First Amendment.  The \nRCAW  Plaintiffs  further  claimed  that  the  government’s \nimplementation of the regulations violates the APA, including \nby  adopting  an  erroneous  interpretation  of  the  “religious \nemployer” categorical exemption that precludes the church-\nplan Plaintiffs from qualifying for it.  They also claimed in \nsupplemental briefing that the interim final rule was invalidly \npromulgated without notice and comment.7  The RCAW case \nwas  assigned  to  a  different  district  judge  who  also \nconsolidated proceedings on the preliminary injunction and \nthe merits, but who granted in part and denied in part the \nparties’ cross-motions for summary judgment.  \nThe  court  rejected  Catholic  University’s  RFRA  claim \nand  granted  that  of  Thomas  Aquinas  College.    Roman \nCatholic Archbishop of Wash. v. Sebelius (RCAW), No. 13-\n1441, 2013 WL 6729515, at *15-24 (D.D.C. Dec. 20, 2013).  \nThe  court  held  that  the  accommodation  did  not  impose  a \nsubstantial burden on Catholic University’s religious exercise \nbecause  “the  accommodation  effectively  severs  an \norganization that offers its employees or students an insured \ngroup health plan from participation in the provision of the \ncontraceptive coverage.”  Id. at *15.  The court determined \nthat  Thomas  Aquinas  College  was  entitled  to  summary \njudgment on its RFRA claim, however, because, as the court \nunderstood  the  regulations,  “a  series  of  duties  and \nobligations” constituting a substantial burden could fall on the \nself-insured College if, after the College opted out, its current \nTPA were to decline to serve as the plan administrator for \n                                                 \n7  The  RCAW  Plaintiffs  abandoned  on  appeal  their  other  APA \nclaims.   \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 17 of 86\n17 \n \npurposes of the contraceptive coverage requirement.8  Id. at \n*24.  The court granted the government’s cross-motion for \nsummary  judgment  on  the  other  constitutional  and  APA \nclaims.9    \nAll Plaintiffs appealed and sought injunctions pending \nappeal, while the government cross-appealed the rulings in \nfavor of the RCAW Plaintiffs.  We consolidated the appeals \nand granted an injunction pending appeal.  \nII.  Standard of Review \nWhether claims are decided on a motion to dismiss or for \nsummary  judgment,  we  review  the  district  courts’ \ndeterminations de novo.  Rudder v. Williams, 666 F.3d 790, \n794 (D.C. Cir. 2012); Potter v. District of Columbia, 558 F.3d \n542, 547 (D.C. Cir. 2009).  A motion to dismiss for failure to \nstate a claim should be granted if the complaint does not \n                                                 \n8  The  court  also  granted  summary  judgment  to  both  Thomas \nAquinas College and the church-plan Plaintiffs on their challenge \nto the so-called “non-interference” regulation, which prevented a \nself-insured organization from seeking to “influence” a TPA.  The \ncourt concluded that the regulation imposed an unconstitutional \ncontent-based limitation that “directly burdens, chills, and inhibits” \nPlaintiffs’ free speech.  RCAW, 2013 WL 6729515, at *37-38.  That \nregulation has since been rescinded, 79 Fed. Reg. 51,092, 51,095 \n(Aug. 27, 2014), rendering that claim moot.  \n9  The  district  court  believed  that,  because  the  Archdiocese  is \nexempt from the contraceptive coverage requirement, it was “not \njoined in” the RFRA claim, RCAW, 2013 WL 6729515, at *8, and \nthat  the  church-plan  Plaintiffs  lacked  standing  to  bring  such  a \nclaim, id. at *24-27.  The court also concluded that some Plaintiffs \nlacked standing to raise some of the other claims alleged in the \ncomplaint.  See, e.g., id. at *43-44, 47.  To the extent necessary to \nestablish  this  Court’s  subject  matter  jurisdiction,  we  address \nstanding below. \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 18 of 86\n18 \n \ncontain “sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a \nclaim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Ashcroft v. \nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).   \nSummary judgment is appropriate only if “there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n56(a); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, \n247-48 (1986); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-\n23 (1986). \nIII.  Standing \nThe RCAW district court concluded that the church-plan \nPlaintiffs  lack  standing  to  challenge  the  accommodation.  \n2013 WL 6729515, at *26.  The government does not press \nthat issue on appeal, but we have an independent obligation to \nconfirm our jurisdiction.  See Ams. for Safe Access v. DEA, \n706  F.3d  438,  442  (D.C.  Cir.  2013).    “[I]n  determining \nwhether plaintiffs have standing, we must assume that on the \nmerits they would be successful in their claims.”  Muir v. \nNavy Fed. Credit Union, 529 F.3d 1100, 1106 (D.C. Cir. \n2008) (internal alterations and quotation marks omitted).   \nPlaintiffs contend that they are injured by the challenged \nregulations because they are forced to choose among options, \neach of which, they argue, would require them to violate their \nsincerely  held  religious  beliefs:    They  may  either  directly \nprovide contraceptive coverage to their employees, or pay \nonerous  penalties  for  failing  to  include  contraceptive \ncoverage in their plans.  The government has offered them a \nthird  option  in  the  form  of  the  accommodation:    exclude \ncontraceptive coverage from their plans.  They object to that, \ntoo, however, because if they exclude contraceptive coverage \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 19 of 86\n19 \n \nfrom  their  plans,  the  regulations  require  someone  else  to \nprovide  it  in  a  way  that  they  contend  amounts  to  their \nfacilitation  of  the  objected-to  coverage.    Plaintiffs  further \nclaim that they are faced with those impossible choices as a \nresult of the ACA regulations, and that a ruling from this \nCourt  invalidating  those  regulations  would  redress  their \ninjury.  As a general matter, the government does not contest \nthat  Plaintiffs’  claimed  injury  is  legally  cognizable  and \nconcrete.   \nIn  successfully  challenging  the  church-plan  Plaintiffs’ \nstanding in district court, the government argued that it lacks \nauthority to impose on those particular Plaintiffs the harm of \nwhich  they  complain  and  that  they  thus  cannot  allege \nsufficient  injury  to  support  standing.    Specifically,  the \ngovernment contended that it could not require a TPA—the \nfirm the Archdiocese hired to administer its plan and process \nits claims—to provide contraceptive coverage to the church-\nplan  Plaintiffs’  employees.10    In  those  circumstances,  the \ngovernment  contended,  a  legal  victory  in  this  case  would \nchange nothing.   \n                                                 \n10 That is because church plans (such as the Archdiocese’s) are \nexempt from ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1003(b)(2), and ERISA is the \nonly vehicle through which the government may enforce a TPA’s \nobligation  to  provide  contraception  coverage  under  the \naccommodation.  See 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(b).  The government \nclaimed that, in light of its lack of a governmental enforcement \nmechanism,  the  Archdiocese’s  TPA  could  not  be  expected  to \nprovide  the  requisite  coverage  to  the  church-plan  Plaintiffs’ \nemployees.  As a result of that regulatory loophole, the district \ncourt held that the church-plan Plaintiffs are not injured by either \nthe contraceptive coverage requirement or the requirement that they \ncomplete the self-certification as a condition of opting out.     \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 20 of 86\n20 \n \nWhether or not the obligation is enforceable, however, it \nis  undisputed  that,  if  the  church-plan  Plaintiffs  want  a \nreligious accommodation, they are legally required to request \nit through the opt-out process.  Like all the other Plaintiffs, \nthe church-plan Plaintiffs allege that their religious beliefs \nforbid them from availing themselves of the accommodation \nbecause doing so would render them complicit in a scheme \naimed  at  providing  contraceptive  coverage.    They  thus \ncontend that the burden on their religious exercise is the same \nas the burden on any Plaintiff whose TPA or insurer provides \ncoverage  according  to  the  regulations.    Their  burdens  are \nequally  concrete,  even  though  the  asserted  burden  on  the \nother Plaintiffs is backed by a threat of enforcement against a \npotentially  recalcitrant  TPA,  whereas  the  church-plan \nPlaintiffs’ asserted burden is not.  Because the regulations \nrequire the church-plan Plaintiffs to take an action that they \ncontend substantially burdens their religious exercise, they, \nlike the other Plaintiffs, have alleged a sufficiently concrete \ninjury.11  See In re Navy Chaplaincy, 697 F.3d 1171, 1176-77 \n(D.C. Cir. 2012) (holding that “policies and procedures” that \nplaintiff  claimed  produced  future  injury  on  the  basis  of \nreligious belief were sufficient to confer standing). \nThe  Archdiocese  presents  a  distinct  standing  question \nbecause  it  is  completely  exempt  from  the  challenged \n                                                 \n11 Two of the church-plan Plaintiffs, Catholic Information Center \nand Don Bosco, have fewer than 50 employees and therefore are \nnot subject to the ACA’s requirement that employers provide their \nemployees  with  health  insurance.    See  26  U.S.C.  § 4980H(a), \n(c)(2).  We need not address whether that affects their standing, \nhowever, because the presence of other Plaintiffs with standing is \nsufficient to satisfy Article III.  See, e.g., Rumsfeld v. Forum for \nAcademic & Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 52 n.2 (2006) \n(“[T]he presence of one party with standing is sufficient to satisfy \nArticle III’s case-or-controversy requirement.”).  \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 21 of 86\n21 \n \nregulation.  It contends that it has a RFRA claim because it \nsponsors  the  self-insured  plan  in  which  the  church-plan \nPlaintiffs  participate.    It  argues  that,  despite  its  own \nexemption, it faces an impossible choice of either sponsoring \na plan that will provide the employees of the church-plan \nPlaintiffs with access to contraceptive services, or no longer \nextending its plan to those entities, leaving them exposed to \npenalties if they do not contract with another provider that \nwill  provide  the  coverage.    The  first  option,  in  its  view, \nsubstantially  burdens  its  sincerely  held  religious  beliefs  in \nviolation  of  RFRA,  and  the  second  option  allows  the \ngovernment  to  interfere  with  what  it  casts  as  its  internal \noperations, in violation of the Religion Clauses of the First \nAmendment.  Our holding that the church-plan Plaintiffs have \nstanding also supports the Archdiocese’s claim of redressable \ninjury adequate to support its standing to sue.12 \nIV.  RFRA Claim   \nThe claim that lies at the heart of this case is Plaintiffs’ \nRFRA challenge to the accommodation.  RFRA provides that \nthe  federal  government  may  not  “substantially  burden”  a \nperson’s religious exercise, even if the burden results from a \nrule  that  applies  generally  to  religious  and  non-religious \npersons alike, unless the burden “(1) is in furtherance of a \ncompelling  governmental  interest;  and  (2)  is  the  least \nrestrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental \ninterest.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1.  In other words, if the law’s \nrequirements do not amount to a substantial burden under \nRFRA,  that  is  the  end  of  the  matter.    Where  a  law  does \n                                                 \n12  Because  the  Archdiocese’s  RFRA  claim  derives  from  its \nsponsorship of a plan that also insures employees of the church-\nplan Plaintiffs, the Archdiocese’s claim rises and falls with that of \nthe church-plan Plaintiffs and so is not separately analyzed below. \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 22 of 86\n22 \n \nimpose a substantial burden, Congress has instructed that “we \nmust return to ‘the compelling interest test as set forth in \nSherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963), and Wisconsin v. \nYoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972).’”  Kaemmerling v. Lappin, 553 \nF.3d  669,  677  (D.C.  Cir.  2008)  (quoting  42  U.S.C. \n§ 2000bb(b)(1)).    Congress  directly  referenced  and \nincorporated the legal standards the Supreme Court used in its \npre-Smith line of cases in RFRA.  Constitutional free exercise \ncases that predate Smith accordingly remain instructive when \ndetermining RFRA’s requirements.  See id. at 678-80. \nWe  pause  at  the  outset  to  make  some  general \nobservations about the contours of Plaintiffs’ claims.  First, \nPlaintiffs’  case  is  significantly  different  from  the  recent, \nsuccessful  Supreme  Court  challenge  brought  by  for-profit, \nclosely-held corporations in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, \nInc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014).  There, the Court concluded that, \nin  the  absence  of  any  accommodation,  the  contraceptive \ncoverage requirement imposed a substantial burden on the \nreligious  exercise  of  for-profit  corporations  because  those \nplaintiffs  were  required  either  to  provide  health  insurance \ncoverage that included contraceptive benefits in violation of \ntheir religious beliefs, or to pay substantial fines.  Id. at 2775-\n76.  A critical difference here is that the regulations already \ngive Plaintiffs the third choice that the for-profit corporate \nplaintiffs  in  Hobby  Lobby  sought:    They  can  avoid  both \nproviding  the  contraceptive  coverage  and  the  penalties \nassociated  with  non-compliance  by  opting  out  of  the \ncontraceptive coverage requirement altogether.   \nPlaintiffs contend that, even with the choice to opt out, \nthe regulations leave them with the same “Hobson’s choice” \nas the for-profit corporations in Hobby Lobby.  In their view, \navailing themselves of the accommodation requires them to \nviolate their sincerely held religious beliefs just as surely as \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 23 of 86\n23 \n \nwould providing contraceptive coverage to their employees.  \nBut the opt out already available to Plaintiffs is precisely the \nalternative the Supreme Court considered in Hobby Lobby \nand  assumed  would  not  impinge  on  the  for-profit \ncorporations’  religious  beliefs  even  as  it  fully  served  the \ngovernment’s interest.13  Id. at 2782.   \nThis  case  also  differs  from  Hobby  Lobby  in  another \ncrucial  respect:    In  holding  that  Hobby  Lobby  must  be \naccommodated,  the  Supreme  Court  repeatedly  underscored \nthat  the  effect  on  women’s  contraceptive  coverage  of \nextending the accommodation to the complaining businesses \n“would be precisely zero.”  Id. at 2760; see also id. at 2781 \nn.37 (“Our decision in these cases need not result in any \ndetrimental effect on any third party.”); id. at 2782 (extending \naccommodation to Hobby Lobby would “protect the asserted \nneeds of women as effectively” as not doing so).  Justice \nKennedy in his concurrence emphasized the same point, that \nextending  the  accommodation  to  for-profit  corporations \n“equally  furthers  the  Government’s  interest  but  does  not \n                                                 \n13 Plaintiffs also have a fourth option under the ACA:  ceasing to \noffer  health  insurance  as  an  employment  benefit,  and  instead \npaying  the  shared  responsibility  assessment  and  leaving  the \nemployees to obtain subsidized health care coverage on a health \ninsurance exchange.  See 26 U.S.C. § 4980H.  That is permitted by \nthe  Act  and  regulations  and  might  well  be  less  expensive  to \nemployers than contributing to employee health benefits.  Plaintiffs, \nhowever,  contend  that  declining  to  arrange  health  insurance \nbenefits for their employees also would injure them because it \nwould be inconsistent with their religious mission and would deny \nthem  the  recruitment  and  retention  benefits  of  providing  tax-\nadvantaged health care coverage to their employees.  See Oral Arg. \nTr. at 19:5-15; see also Pls.’ R. Br. 21 n.9; see generally Hobby \nLobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2776-77 & n. 32.  The government has not \npressed the point here. \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 24 of 86\n24 \n \nimpinge on the plaintiffs’ religious beliefs.”  Id. at 2786.  The \nrelief Plaintiffs seek here, in contrast, would hinder women’s \naccess  to  contraception.    It  would  either  deny  the \ncontraceptive coverage altogether or, at a minimum, make the \ncoverage  no  longer  seamless  from  the  beneficiaries’ \nperspective, instead requiring them to take additional steps to \nobtain contraceptive coverage elsewhere.   \nSecond, Plaintiffs’ claim is extraordinary and potentially \nfar reaching:  Plaintiffs argue that a religious accommodation, \ndesigned to permit them to free themselves entirely from the \ncontraceptive  coverage  requirement,  itself  imposes  a \nsubstantial burden.  As the Seventh Circuit put the point, \n“[w]hat  makes  this  case  and  others  like  it  involving  the \ncontraception  exemption  paradoxical  and  virtually \nunprecedented  is  that  the  beneficiaries  of  the  religious \nexemption  are  claiming  that  the  exemption  process  itself \nimposes a substantial burden on their religious faiths.”  Notre \nDame, 743 F.3d at 557.  As the Notre Dame court noted, it is \nanalogous to a religious conscientious objector to a military \ndraft claiming that the act of identifying himself as such on \nhis  Selective  Service  card  constitutes  a  substantial  burden \nbecause that identification would then “trigger” the draft of a \nfellow selective service registrant in his place and thereby \nimplicate the objector in facilitating war.  Id. at 556. \nReligious  objectors  do  not  suffer  substantial  burdens \nunder  RFRA  where  the  only  harm  to  them  is  that  they \nsincerely  feel  aggrieved  by  their  inability  to  prevent  what \nother people would do to fulfill regulatory objectives after \nthey opt out.  Cf. id. at 556.  They have no RFRA right to be \nfree from the unease, or even anguish, of knowing that third \nparties are legally privileged or obligated to act in ways their \nreligion abhors.  See generally Lyng v. Nw. Indian Cemetery \nProtective Ass’n, 485 U.S. 439, 449 (1988) (distinguishing \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 25 of 86\n25 \n \nbetween right to avoid being “coerced . . . into violating their \nreligious beliefs” and the lack of right to pursue “spiritual \nfulfillment  according  to  their  own  religious  beliefs”).  \n“Government simply could not operate if it were required to \nsatisfy every citizen’s religious needs and desires.”  Id. at \n453.  \nWe  now  turn  to  the  substance  of  Plaintiffs’  RFRA \nclaims.    We  first  consider  their  contention  that  the \naccommodation  imposes  a  substantial  burden  on  their \nreligious exercise that is cognizable under RFRA.  We then \nanalyze  the  government’s  claim  that  any  such  burden  is \njustified  under  RFRA  because  it  could  not  be  made  any \nlighter and still serve the government’s compelling interests.  \nA.   The Accommodation Does Not \nSubstantially Burden Plaintiffs’ Religious Exercise \nIn our cosmopolitan nation with its people of diverse \nconvictions, freedom of religious exercise is protected yet not \nabsolute.  That is true under the heightened standard Congress \nenacted in RFRA as well as the constitutional baseline set by \nthe  Free  Exercise  Clause.    The  limitations  that  prove \ndeterminative  here  are  that  only  “substantial”  burdens  on \nreligious  exercise  require  accommodation,  and  that  an \nadherent  may  not  use  a  religious  objection  to  dictate  the \nconduct of the government or of third parties.  This Court \nexplained in Kaemmerling that “[a] substantial burden exists \nwhen  government  action  puts  ‘substantial  pressure  on  an \nadherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.’”  \n553 F.3d at 678 (quoting Thomas v. Review Bd., 450 U.S. \n707, 718 (1981)).  A burden does not rise to the level of being \nsubstantial when it places “[a]n inconsequential or de minimis \nburden”  on  an  adherent’s  religious  exercise.  Id.  (citing \nLevitan  v.  Ashcroft,  281  F.3d  1313,  1320-21  (D.C.  Cir. \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 26 of 86\n26 \n \n2002)).    An  asserted  burden  is  also  not  an  actionable  \nsubstantial  burden  when  it  falls  on  a  third  party,  not  the \nreligious adherent.  See, e.g., Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693, \n699 (1986). \nPlaintiffs’ objection rests on their religious belief that \n“they may not provide, pay for, and/or facilitate access to \ncontraception, sterilization, abortion, or related counseling in \na manner that violates the teachings of the Catholic Church.”  \nPls.’ Br. 15.  But the regulations do not compel them to do \nany of those things.  Instead, the accommodation provides \nPlaintiffs a simple, one-step form for opting out and washing \ntheir  hands  of  any  involvement  in  providing  insurance \ncoverage for contraceptive services. \n1.  The Court Must Evaluate Assertions of Substantial \nBurden \n \nThe sincerity of Plaintiffs’ religious commitment is not at \nissue in this litigation.  Plaintiffs are correct that they—and \nnot  this  Court—determine  what  religious  observance  their \nfaith commands.  There is no dispute about the sincerity of \nPlaintiffs’  belief  that  providing,  paying  for,  or  facilitating \naccess to contraceptive services would be contrary to their \nfaith.   \nAccepting the sincerity of Plaintiffs’ beliefs, however, \ndoes not relieve this Court of its responsibility to evaluate the \nsubstantiality of any burden on Plaintiffs’ religious exercise, \nand to distinguish Plaintiffs’ duties from obligations imposed, \nnot  on  them,  but  on  insurers  and  TPAs.    Whether  a  law \nsubstantially  burdens  religious  exercise  under  RFRA  is  a \nquestion of law for courts to decide, not a question of fact.  \nSee Mahoney v. Doe, 642 F.3d 1112, 1121 (D.C. Cir. 2011) \n(stating  that  judicial  inquiry  into  the  substantiality  of  the \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 27 of 86\n27 \n \nburden  “prevent[s]  RFRA  claims  from  being  reduced  into \nquestions of fact, proven by the credibility of the claimant”); \nKaemmerling,  553  F.3d  at  679  (“[a]ccepting  as  true  the \nfactual allegations that Kaemmerling’s beliefs are sincere and \nof a religious nature—but not the legal conclusion, cast as a \nfactual allegation, that his religious exercise is substantially \nburdened”).  “[A]lthough we acknowledge that the [plaintiffs] \nbelieve that the regulatory framework makes them complicit \nin  the  provision  of  contraception,  we  will  independently \ndetermine what the regulatory provisions require and whether \nthey impose a substantial burden on [plaintiffs’] exercise of \nreligion.”  Mich. Catholic Conf., 755 F.3d at 385; see also \nNotre Dame, 743 F.3d at 558 (“Notre Dame may consider the \n[self-certification]  process  a  substantial  burden,  but \nsubstantiality—like compelling governmental interest—is for \nthe court to decide.”). \nOur  own  decision  in  Kaemmerling  requires  that  we \ndetermine whether a burden asserted by Plaintiffs qualifies as \n“substantial”  under  RFRA.    In  Kaemmerling,  a  federal \nprisoner sought to enjoin the Bureau of Prisons under RFRA \nfrom collecting a sample of his blood, claiming a religious \nobjection to “DNA sampling, collection and storage with no \nclear limitations of use.”  553 F.3d at 678.  We observed that \n“Kaemmerling’s  objection  to  ‘DNA  sampling  and \ncollection’” was not “an objection to the [Bureau] collecting \nany  bodily  specimen  that  contains  DNA  material . . . ,  but \nrather  an  objection  to  the  government  extracting  DNA \ninformation from the specimen.”  Id. at 679.  We did not \nsimply accept Kaemmerling’s characterization of his burden \nas  “substantial,”  but  instead  independently  evaluated  the \nnature of the claimed burden on his religious beliefs.  See id. \nat 678-79.  The plaintiff failed to “allege facts sufficient to \nstate a substantial burden on his religious exercise because he \n[could not] identify any ‘exercise’ which is the subject of the \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 28 of 86\n28 \n \nburden  to  which  he  objects.”    Id.  at  679.    The  court \nacknowledged that “the government’s activities with his fluid \nor  tissue  sample  after  the  [Bureau]  takes  it  may  offend \nKaemmerling’s  religious  beliefs,”  but  it  rejected  the \nsubstantial burden contention because “Kaemmerling alleges \nno religious observance that the DNA Act impedes, [n]or acts \nin violation of his religious beliefs that it pressures him to \nperform.”  Id.  \nIn Henderson v. Kennedy, 253 F.3d 12, 17 (D.C. Cir. \n2001), this Court similarly rejected the plaintiffs’ formulation \nof the substantial-burden test as forbidding the government’s \ngeneral application of religiously neutral law where it would \nimpose any burden on religiously motivated conduct because \ndoing so would “read out of RFRA the condition that only \nsubstantial  burdens  on  the  exercise  of  religion  trigger  the \ncompelling interest requirement.”  As RFRA sponsor Senator \nOrrin  Hatch  explained,  the  Act  “does  not  require  the \nGovernment to justify every action that has some effect on \nreligious  exercise.    Only  action  that  places  a  substantial \nburden on the exercise of religion must meet the compelling \nState interest . . . .” 139 Cong. Rec. 26,180 (1993) (statement \nof Sen. Hatch).   \nUnder free exercise precedents that RFRA codified, the \nSupreme Court distinguished between substantial burdens on \nreligious exercise, which are actionable, and burdens that are \nnot.  Burdens that are only slight, negligible, or de minimis \nare not substantial.  And burdens that fall only on third parties \nnot before the court do not substantially burden plaintiffs.  \nSee, e.g., Bowen, 476 U.S. at 699 (“The Free Exercise Clause \nsimply cannot be understood to require the Government to \nconduct its own internal affairs in ways that comport with the \nreligious beliefs of particular citizens.”); Lyng, 485 U.S. at \n447 (finding it undisputed that the government’s action “will \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 29 of 86\n29 \n \nhave severe adverse effects on the practice of [plaintiffs’] \nreligion,”  but  disagreeing  that  such  burden  was  “heavy \nenough” to subject that action to strict scrutiny).   \nIn Bowen, a Native American plaintiff brought a free \nexercise challenge to a statute requiring the state to use his \ndaughter’s social security number to process welfare benefits \nrequests.  476 U.S. at 695-96.  Roy, the father, believed that \nthe government’s use of the social security number of his \ndaughter, Little Bird of the Snow, would serve to “‘rob the \nspirit’ of his daughter and prevent her from attaining greater \nspiritual power.”  Id. at 696.  The Court rejected Roy’s claim \non the basis that, rather than complaining about a restriction \non his own conduct, Roy sought to “dictate the conduct of the \nGovernment’s internal procedures.”  Id. at 700.  Roy’s claim \nfailed  because,  even  though  it  seriously  offended  Roy’s \nreligious sensibilities, “[t]he Federal Government’s use of a \nSocial Security number for Little Bird of the Snow d[id] not \nitself in any degree impair Roy’s freedom to believe, express, \nand exercise his religion.”  Id. at 700-01 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). \nBuilding on the analysis in Bowen, the Supreme Court \nrefused to apply strict scrutiny to the government’s land use \ndecision in Lyng.  485 U.S. at 450.  There, members of Indian \ntribes claimed that the federal government violated their right \nto  free  exercise  by  permitting  timber  harvesting  and \nconstruction on land they used for religious purposes.  Id. at \n441-42.  The Court stated that its free exercise jurisprudence \n“does  not  and  cannot  imply  that  incidental  effects  of \ngovernment programs, which may make it more difficult to \npractice  certain  religions  but  which  have  no  tendency  to \ncoerce  individuals  into  acting  contrary  to  their  religious \nbeliefs, require government to bring forward a compelling \njustification for its otherwise lawful actions.”  Id. at 450-51.   \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 30 of 86\n30 \n \nAccording to Plaintiffs, this Court is bound to accept \ntheir  understanding  of  the  obligations  the  regulations \nimpose—including  their  view  of  the  existence  and \nsubstantiality of any burden on their own religious exercise—\nbecause to do otherwise would be tantamount to questioning \nthe sincerity of their beliefs.  Indeed, under Plaintiffs’ view, \nwe must accept a RFRA claimant’s understanding of what the \nchallenged law requires her to do (or to refrain from doing), \neven if that subjective understanding is at odds with what the \nlaw  actually  requires.14    Plaintiffs’  approach  collapses  the \ndistinction  between  sincerely  held  belief  and  substantial \nburden.  We must give effect to each term in the governing \nstatute,  however,  including  the  requirement  that  only \n“substantial”  burdens  on  religious  exercise  trigger  strict \n                                                 \n14  Plaintiffs  elaborated  their  position  in  their  responses  to  a \nhypothetical posed during oral argument.  We posited a situation in \nwhich an adherent, similar to the plaintiff in Thomas, objected to \nworking  in  a  factory  on  the  grounds  that  the  tools  he  was \nmanufacturing were being used to support a war effort that his \nsincere  religious  beliefs  prohibited  him  from  supporting.    See \nThomas, 450 U.S. at 710 (after being transferred to a department \nthat  “fabricated  turrets  for  military  tanks,  .  .  .  [Thomas]  quit, \nasserting that he could not work on weapons without violating the \nprinciples of his religion”).  Unlike the facts in Thomas, however, \nin our hypothetical, the adherent was not manufacturing tools used \nfor  war,  but  rather  farm  equipment  that  had  no  relationship \nwhatsoever to any military effort.  Counsel for both the Priests for \nLife Plaintiffs and the RCAW Plaintiffs conceded that, under their \nview, if the religious objection was to war machinery, not farm \ntools,  a  plaintiff  who  misperceived  the  facts  underlying  his \nchallenge would be entitled nonetheless to a determination that \nrequiring him to continue working in a farm tools factory imposed \na substantial burden on his religious observance merely because he \nsincerely believed that it did.  Oral Arg. Tr. at 9:3-11:16; 22:16-\n23:24.  \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 31 of 86\n31 \n \nscrutiny.  We cannot accept Plaintiffs’ proposal to prevent the \ncourt  from  evaluating  the  substantiality  of  the  asserted \nburden.  \n2.  The Accommodation Frees Eligible Organizations \nfrom the Contraceptive Coverage Requirement \nA review of the regulatory accommodation shows that \nthe opt-out mechanism imposes a de minimis requirement on \nany  eligible  organization:    The  organization  must  send  a \nsingle sheet of paper honestly communicating its eligibility \nand sincere religious objection in order to be excused from \nthe  contraceptive  coverage  requirement.    Once  an  eligible \norganization has taken the simple step of objecting, all action \ntaken to pay for or provide its employees with contraceptive \nservices is taken by a third party.  \nSpecifically, the regulations require that, to be eligible \nfor the accommodation, an organization must certify that it \nhas a sincere religious objection to arranging contraceptive \ncoverage.15    See  45  C.F.R.  § 147.131(b);  29  C.F.R. \n§ 2590.715-2713A(a).  The organization opts out under the \nregulations by affirming that it meets those eligibility criteria \nvia a “self-certification” form sent to its group health plan \nissuer  or  TPA,  or  a  letter  to  the  Secretary  of  HHS  (the \n“alternative notice”).  45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(1); 29 C.F.R. \n§ 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(ii);  see  also  79  Fed.  Reg.  51,092, \n                                                 \n15  The  Supreme  Court,  in  Hobby  Lobby,  134  S.  Ct.  at  2782, \ncharacterized  the  accommodation  HHS  designed  for  eligible \norganizations  as  a  less  restrictive  means  of  serving  the \ngovernment’s interest in the contraceptive coverage requirement \nthat  should  be  made  available  to  the  closely-held,  for-profit \nreligious  corporate  plaintiffs  in  that  case.    The  government \naccordingly is extending the accommodation to such companies.  \nSee 79 Fed. Reg. at 51,094. \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 32 of 86\n32 \n \n51,094-95 (Aug. 27, 2014).  An alternative notice to HHS \nmust identify the forms of contraceptive services to which the \nemployer objects, and specify, among other things, the name \nof the plan, the plan type, and the contact information for the \nplan  issuer  or  TPA.16    45  C.F.R.  §  147.131(c)(1)(ii);  29 \nC.F.R.  §  2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(ii)(B).    Once  an  eligible \norganization  avails  itself  of  the  accommodation,  that \norganization has discharged its legal obligations under the \nchallenged regulations.  See 45 C.F.R. § 147.131(c)(1), (e)(2); \n29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1); 79 Fed. Reg. at 51,094-\n95.   \nThe  accommodation  here  works  in  the  way  such \nmechanisms ordinarily do:  the objector completes the written \nequivalent of raising a hand in response to the government’s \nquery as to which religious organizations want to opt out.  \nOnce the eligible organization expresses its desire to have no \ninvolvement  in  the  practice  to  which  it  objects,  the \ngovernment  ensures  that  a  separation  is  effectuated  and \narranges  for  other  entities  to  step  in  and  fill  the  gap  as \nrequired  to  serve  the  legislatively  mandated  regime.  \nSpecifically, the regulations:    \n  require that the group health plan insurer expressly \nexclude contraceptive coverage from the eligible \n                                                 \n16 Initially, an eligible organization could only avail itself of the \naccommodation  by  completing  the  self-certification  form.    The \nSupreme  Court  issued  an  interim  order  in  Wheaton  College  v. \nBurwell, 134 S. Ct. 2806 (2014), however, permitting an eligible \norganization  to  notify  the  Secretary  of  HHS  in  writing  of  its \nobjection instead of sending the self-certification directly to the \ninsurer or TPA.  Id. at 2807.  The Departments accordingly issued \ninterim  final  regulations  to  authorize  opting  out  using  that \nalternative notice.  79 Fed. Reg. at 51,094-95.      \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 33 of 86\n33 \n \norganization’s  group  health  plan,17  45  C.F.R. \n§ 147.131(c)(2)(i)(A); \n \n  fully  divorce  the  eligible  organization  from \npayments  for  contraceptive  coverage,  see  45 \nC.F.R.  § 147.131(c)(2);  29  C.F.R.  § 2590.715-\n2713A(b)(2)(i); \n \n  require  that  the  insurer  or  TPA  notify  the \nbeneficiaries in separate mailings that it will be \nproviding  separate  contraceptive  coverage,  45 \nC.F.R.  § 147.131(d);  29  C.F.R.  § 2590.715-\n2713A(d); \n \n  require  that  the  insurer  or  TPA  specify  to  the \nbeneficiaries in those separate mailings that their \nemployer  is  in  no  way  “administer[ing]  or \nfund[ing]”  the  contraceptive  coverage.  (The \nregulations  include  model  language  for  such \nnotice, suggesting that the insurer or TPA specify \nto  employees  that  “your  employer  will  not \ncontract, arrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive \ncoverage.”)  45  C.F.R.  § 147.131(d);  29  C.F.R. \n§ 2590.715-2713A(d); and \n \n  demand separate mailings and accounting on the \npart of the insurer or TPA, keeping contraceptive \ncoverage  separate  for  all  purposes  from  the \neligible  organization’s  plan  that  exclude  it,  45 \n                                                 \n17 There is no analogous requirement for TPAs because it is the \nself-insured employer that controls the scope of coverage provided \nunder its plan.  Once it has opted out, a self-insured employer has \nsatisfied  its  legal  obligation  under  the  contraceptive-coverage \nregulations.  29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(1). \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 34 of 86\n34 \n \nC.F.R.  § 147.131(c)(2)(ii),  (d);  29  C.F.R. \n§ 2590.715-2713A(b)(2), (d). \nThe  regulations  leave  eligible  organizations  free  to \nexpress to their employees their opposition to contraceptive \ncoverage.    In  sum,  both  opt-out  mechanisms  let  eligible \norganizations extricate themselves fully from the burden of \nproviding contraceptive coverage to employees, pay nothing \ntoward  such  coverage,  and  have  the  providers  tell  the \nemployees that their employers play no role and in no way \nshould be seen to endorse the coverage.   \nPlaintiffs’ opposition to the consequences of the ACA’s \nWomen’s Health Amendment, even with the accommodation, \namounts to an objection to the regulations’ requirement that \nthird parties provide to Plaintiffs’ beneficiaries products and \nservices  that  Plaintiffs  believe  are  sinful.    What  Plaintiffs \nobject to here are “the government’s independent actions in \nmandating contraceptive coverage, not to any action that the \ngovernment  has  required  [Plaintiffs]  themselves  to  take.”  \nNotre Dame, 743 F.3d at 559 (quoting Order at 3, Priests for \nLife v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., No. 13-5368 \n(Dec. 31, 2013) (Tatel, J., statement) (hereinafter “Emergency \nInjunctions Order”)).  But RFRA does not grant Plaintiffs a \nreligious veto against plan providers’ compliance with those \nregulations,  nor  the  right  to  enlist  the  government  to \neffectuate  such  a  religious  veto  against  legally  required \nconduct of third parties.  See, e.g., Lyng, 485 U.S. at 452; \nBowen, 476 U.S. at 699-700; Kaemmerling, 553 F.3d at 679; \nsee also Mich. Catholic Conf., 755 F.3d at 388-89; Notre \nDame, 743 F.3d at 552.   \nPlaintiffs seek to distinguish Kaemmerling and Bowen on \nthe  ground  that,  unlike  the  plaintiffs  in  those  cases,  they \nobject to what the regulations require of them.  But the only \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 35 of 86\n35 \n \naction the regulations require of Plaintiffs—completion of the \nself-certification or alternative notice—imposes a de minimis \nadministrative obligation.18  To the extent that their objection \nis to the role of that action in the broader regulatory scheme—\na  scheme  that  permits  or  requires  independent  coverage \nproviders  to  take  actions  to  which  Plaintiffs  object—their \nchallenge is governed by Kaemmerling and Bowen.  As in \nBowen,  even  though  Plaintiffs’  “religious  views  may  not \naccept this distinction between individual and governmental \nconduct,”  the  Constitution  does  “recognize  such  a \ndistinction.”  476 U.S. at 701 n.6.  So, too, does RFRA.  And \njust as the plaintiffs in Bowen and Kaemmerling could not \nsuccessfully challenge what the government chose to do with \ntheir  social  security  numbers  or  DNA  specimens, \nrespectively,  Plaintiffs  have  no  RFRA  claim  against  the \ngovernment’s arrangements with others to provide coverage \nto women left partially uninsured as a result of Plaintiffs’ opt \nout.  RFRA does not treat the government requiring third \nparties to provide contraceptive coverage in the face of an \nemployer’s  religious  disapproval  as  tantamount  to  the \ngovernment  requiring  the  employer  itself  to  sponsor  such \ncoverage.  See Mich. Catholic Conf., 755 F.3d at 388-89; \nNotre  Dame,  743  F.3d  at  554-55;  id.  at  559  (quoting \nEmergency Injunctions Order at 3 (Tatel, J., statement)). \nPlaintiffs  nonetheless  insist  that,  even  with  the \naccommodation,  the  regulations  substantially  burden  their \nreligious exercise by continuing to require that they play a \n                                                 \n18 Plaintiffs object that characterizing the accommodation as simply \nfilling out a form ignores the meanings that Plaintiffs attach to the \nform.  But the meaning Plaintiffs attach to the form derives from \ntheir  contention  that  their  completion  of  the  form  causes  third \nparties to take action.  The error of that contention is discussed \nmore fully infra Section IV.A.2.a.   \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 36 of 86\n36 \n \nrole in the facilitation of contraceptive use.  In particular, they \ncontend  that:    (1)  “signing  and  submitting  the  self-\ncertification”  or  alternative  notice  “triggers”  or \n“impermissibly  facilitates  delivery  of  the  objectionable \ncoverage” to the beneficiaries of their health plans; (2) the \nregulations require “contracting with third parties authorized \nor obligated to provide the mandated coverage;” and (3) the \nregulations require “maintaining health plans that will serve \nas conduits for the delivery of the mandated coverage.”  Pls.’ \nBr.  12,  18;  Pls.’  Supp’l  Br.  1.    Additionally,  self-insured \nPlaintiffs contend that their self-certification expressly and \nimpermissibly authorizes their TPAs to provide contraceptive \ncoverage.   \nEach of those separate, but related, arguments fails for \nfundamentally the same reason:  Notwithstanding Plaintiffs’ \ncontrary  contentions,  the  regulations  provide  an  opt-out \nmechanism that shifts to third parties the obligation to provide \ncontraceptive  coverage  to  which  health  insurance \nbeneficiaries  are  entitled,  and  that  fastidiously  relieves \nPlaintiffs of any obligation to contract, arrange, pay, or refer \nfor access to contraception in any way that might constitute a \nsubstantial burden on their religious exercise under RFRA.  \na. Plaintiffs’ Opt-Out Does Not Trigger \nContraceptive Coverage  \nPlaintiffs claim that the requirement that they submit the \nself-certification to their plan issuers or TPAs, or submit the \nalternative notice to the government, makes them “authorize” \nor “trigger” the provision of the contraceptive coverage they \nfind  religiously  abhorrent.    They  characterize  the  self-\ncertification and alternative notice as “permission slips” for \ntheir plan issuers and TPAs to provide contraceptive coverage \nto  Plaintiffs’  employees.    Pointing  to  the  regulatory \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 37 of 86\n37 \n \nrequirements  of  an  insurer  or  TPA  after  an  eligible \norganization  has  availed  itself  of  the  accommodation, \nPlaintiffs argue that it is their own act of self-certifying or \ncompleting the alternative notice that “confers . . . both the \nauthority  and  obligation”  on  the  insurance  companies  and \nTPAs  to  provide  the  objected-to  coverage  to  Plaintiffs’ \nemployees.  Pls.’ Br. 9.   \nPlaintiffs’ “permission slip” argument misstates how the \nregulations operate.  As the Sixth and Seventh Circuits have \nalso concluded, the insurers’ or TPAs’ obligation to provide \ncontraceptive  coverage  originates  from  the  ACA  and  its \nattendant regulations, not from Plaintiffs’ self-certification or \nalternative notice.  See Mich. Catholic Conf., 755 F.3d at 387; \nNotre Dame, 743 F.3d at 554.  The regulations require that “a \ngroup health plan, or a health insurance issuer offering group \nor  individual  health  insurance  coverage,  must  provide \ncoverage” for a variety of types of preventive care, including \nthe  coverage  to  which  Plaintiffs  object.    45  C.F.R. \n§ 147.130(a)(1).  That obligation exists apart from any action \nthat  Plaintiffs  take.    “‘Because  Congress  has  imposed  an \nindependent obligation on insurers to provide contraceptive \ncoverage  to  [an  eligible  organization’s]  employees,  those \nemployees  will  receive  contraceptive  coverage  from  their \ninsurers  even  if  [objectors]  self-certify—but  not  because \n[objectors]  self-certify.’”    Notre  Dame,  743  F.3d  at  559 \n(quoting  Emergency  Injunctions  Order  at  3  (Tatel,  J., \nstatement)).   \nIndeed, contrary to Plaintiffs’ characterization, what the \nself-certification  or  alternative  notice  actually  triggers  is  a \nseries of steps designed to ensure that eligible organizations \nsuch as Plaintiffs do not contract, arrange, pay, or refer for \naccess to contraceptive services.  The regulations fully relieve \nPlaintiffs  from  the  obligation  to  provide  or  pay  for \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 38 of 86\n38 \n \ncontraceptive coverage, and instead obligate a third party to \nprovide that coverage separately.  \nThe  illogic  of  Plaintiffs’  “trigger”  argument  is \nhighlighted by the conscientious objector scenario recounted \nabove.    The  implication  of  Plaintiffs’  position  is  that  the \nSelective  Service  could  deny  a  religious  conscientious \nobjector’s RFRA claim against calling up the next draftee \nonly if the government’s decision to do so survived strict \nscrutiny.  That strikes us as “a fantastic suggestion.”  Notre \nDame,  743  F.3d  at  556.    There,  as  here,  the  feature  that \ndefeats Plaintiffs’ argument is plain:  It was the government’s \nselective service draft quota, not the conscientious objector \nexercising his accommodation right, that determined whether \na replacement would be called.  So, too, it is the ACA that \nrequires that plan issuers and TPAs fill the resulting gaps, not \nthe  opt-out  notice.    In  neither  case  is  the  objecting  party \nsubstantially  burdened  by,  and  thus  entitled  to \naccommodation from, the sequelae of opting out.  Accurately \nunderstood, the opt-out mechanism imposes on Plaintiffs only \nthe  de  minimis  administrative  burden  associated  with \ncompleting  the  self-certification  form  or  the  alternative \nnotice.  See id.  As long as Plaintiffs complete either notice, \nthe regulations excuse them from any further involvement in \nproviding contraceptive coverage.  As discussed above, the \nbeneficiaries  receive  contraceptive  coverage  not  because \nPlaintiffs have completed the self-certification or alternative \nnotice,  but  because  the  ACA  imposes  an  independent \nobligation on insurers and TPAs to provide this coverage. \nb. Plaintiffs’ Contracts with Providers Do Not \nAuthorize or Facilitate Contraceptive Coverage \nPlaintiffs  further  contend  that  the  regulations \nsubstantially  burden  their  religious  exercise  by  requiring \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 39 of 86\n39 \n \ncontraceptive coverage to be provided for their employees \nand students by the same entities with which Plaintiffs have \ncontracted  to  provide  non-contraceptive  health  coverage.  \nOnce  Plaintiffs  opt  out  of  the  contraceptive  coverage \nrequirement, however, contraceptive services are not provided \nto  women  because  of  Plaintiffs’  contracts  with  insurance \ncompanies; they are provided because federal law requires \ninsurers  and  TPAs  to  provide  insurance  beneficiaries  with \ncoverage for contraception.  Plaintiffs’ contracts do not in any \nway authorize or condone the insurers’ or TPAs’ provision of \nthe  coverage.    The  separate  interactions  between  non-\nobjecting  insurance  companies  and  beneficiaries  do  not \nsubstantially  burden  Plaintiffs’  religious  exercise,  just  as \nthird-party actions in other religious-exercise cases have been \nheld not to burden plaintiffs.  See, e.g., Bowen, 476 U.S. at \n699-700;  Kaemmerling,  553  F.3d  at  679;  see  also  Notre \nDame, 743 F.3d at 552.  We do not understand Plaintiffs to \ncontend that RFRA privileges them generally to require that \nthe  extra-contractual  rights  and  legal  obligations  of \nindividuals and entities with whom they contract conform to \nPlaintiffs’ religious beliefs, nor could they. \nc. Plaintiffs’ Plans Are Not Conduits for \nContraceptive Coverage \nPlaintiffs  also  argue  that  the  regulations  substantially \nburden their religious exercise by permitting their insurance \nplans to be used as conduits through which their employees \nreceive contraception.  Plaintiffs identify a number of acts—\nsuch  as  paying  premiums  and  offering  enrollment \npaperwork—that they contend they must take that ensure that \nthe contraceptive “pipeline” remains open.  None of those \nacts, however, requires Plaintiffs to contract, arrange, pay, or \nrefer  for  access  to  contraception.    Once  Plaintiffs  take \nadvantage of the accommodation, they are dissociated from \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 40 of 86\n40 \n \nthe provision of contraceptive services.  The premiums and \nenrollment paperwork support the provision of health care \ncoverage to which Plaintiffs have no objection—and nothing \nmore. \nPlaintiffs contend that their plans remain a conduit for \nthe provision of contraceptives because they are required to \npay premiums or fees to entities in charge of the plans that \nprovide  contraceptive  benefits.    The  regulations,  however, \nexpressly  prevent  insurers  and  TPAs  from  directly  or \nindirectly  charging  Plaintiffs  for  the  cost  of  contraceptive \ncoverage  and  obligate  third  parties  to  pay  for  the \ncontraceptive  services.    45  C.F.R.  § 147.131(c)(2)(ii);  29 \nC.F.R.  § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2).    Therefore,  although \nPlaintiffs are required to pay premiums and fees to their group \nhealth  plan  issuers  or  TPAs,  those  entities  are  legally \nprohibited  from  using  Plaintiffs’  payments  to  fund \ncontraceptive services.   \n Plaintiffs further contend that their plans are used as \nconduits  because,  they  assert,  they  must  provide  their \nbeneficiaries with enrollment paperwork to enable them to \nparticipate in a plan that provides coverage for contraceptives, \nand they must send, or tell their beneficiaries where to send, \nthe enrollment paperwork.  Under the regulations, however, \nthe employer has no such obligation.  The insurer or TPA is \nentirely  responsible  for  any  paperwork  related  to \ncontraceptive coverage.  The insurer or TPA must provide \nbeneficiaries with notice of the availability of contraceptive \ncoverage,  the  notice  must  be  separate  from  any  materials \ndistributed in connection with the individual’s enrollment in \nthe employer’s plan, and the notice must make clear that the \nemployer  is  not  playing  any  role  in  the  contraceptive \ncoverage.    45  C.F.R.  § 147.131(d);  29  C.F.R.  § 2590.715-\n2713A(d).     \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 41 of 86\n41 \n \nPlaintiffs also argue that their plans serve as conduits \nbecause they must identify their health plan beneficiaries to \ntheir  insurers  or  TPAs.    No  regulation  related  to  the \naccommodation imposes any such duty on Plaintiffs.  See \nMich. Catholic Conf., 755 F.3d at 389.  Plaintiffs will have \nnecessarily provided their plans or TPAs with the names of \nemployees enrolling in their health care plan so that those \nindividuals may be provided with health care coverage.  To \nthe extent that Plaintiffs object to the actions the insurers or \nTPAs  will  take  after  receiving  those  names,  Plaintiffs  are \nobjecting to an independent obligation imposed on a third \nparty by the government.  As discussed above, RFRA does \nnot protect parties from obligations imposed on third parties \nby  outside  sources.    In  short,  none  of  the  actions  that \nPlaintiffs  identify  is  actually  required  of  them  under  the \nregulations,  and  none  of  those  actions  makes  their  plans \nconduits for contraceptive coverage.19  \nd. Regulations Specific to the Self-Insured Plaintiffs \nDo Not Create a Substantial Burden \nFinally, the self-insured Plaintiffs object to the regulatory \nprovisions  that  apply  particularly  to  self-insured \norganizations.  They object that their self-certification forms \nare what designate their TPAs as the plan administrators for \ncontraceptive benefits under section 3(16) of ERISA and also \n                                                 \n19 On a related note, Plaintiffs contend that they must refrain from \ncanceling their contract with a third party authorized to provide \ncoverage  for  contraceptive  services  and  from  attempting  to \ninfluence  a  third  party’s  decision  to  provide  the  coverage  for \ncontraception.  The government denied that the regulations would \nrequire Plaintiffs to refrain from taking either of those actions.  \nGov. Br. 33-34; Oral. Arg. Tr. at 46:15-48:1.  In any event, as \ndiscussed  infra  note  28,  the  regulations  have  been  revised  to \nremove the provision that Plaintiffs alleged so constrained them.   \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 42 of 86\n42 \n \nserve  as  instruments  under  which  the  health  plans  are \noperated.  See 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(b).  They argue that the \nregulations thus put them in the position of facilitating the \nprovision of contraceptives by authorizing the TPAs to take \nactions they previously could not have taken.  \nThat argument miscasts the regulations, which do not \nrequire  the  self-insured  Plaintiffs  to  name  their  TPAs  as \nERISA  plan  fiduciaries.    Plaintiffs  submit  forms  to \ncommunicate their decisions to opt out, not to authorize TPAs \nto do anything on their behalf.  The regulatory treatment of \nthe  form  as  sufficient  under  ERISA  does  not  change  the \nreality  that  the  objected-to  services  are  made  available \nbecause of the regulations, not because Plaintiffs complete a \nself-certification.  29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(b); see Notre Dame, \n743 F.3d at 554-55; 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,880.   \nThe self-insured Plaintiffs raise a parallel objection to the \nalternative  process  established  by  the  revised  regulations.  \nUnder the revised regulations, once the government receives \nan  alternative  notice  from  an  eligible  organization,  the \ngovernment sends the TPA a notification that will “designate \nthe relevant [TPA] as plan administrator under section 3(16) \nof  ERISA  for  those  contraceptive  benefits  that  the  [TPA] \nwould otherwise manage.”  79 Fed. Reg. at 51,095; see also \n29  C.F.R.  §  2510.3-16(b).    The  regulations  make  the \ngovernment’s notification to the TPA “an instrument under \nwhich the plan is operated.”  29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-16(b).   \nThe  self-insured  Plaintiffs  contend  that  the  revised \nregulations thereby violate ERISA because the government \nlacks  authority  to  name  a  plan  administrator  or  amend \nPlaintiffs’  plan  instruments.    Plaintiffs  do  not  contend, \nhowever, that the government lacks authority to author a plan \ninstrument  or  designate  a  particular  writing  as  a  plan \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 43 of 86\n43 \n \ninstrument,  and  it  is  this  authority  the  regulations  deploy.  \nOnce the government receives the alternative notice, it directs \nthe TPA to cover contraceptive services and, treating its own \ndirection as the new plan instrument, the government names \nthe TPA as the plan administrator of contraceptive coverage.  \nERISA expressly permits a plan instrument to name a plan \nadministrator.    29  U.S.C.  § 1002(16)(A)(i)  (defining \n“administrator” as “the person specifically so designated by \nthe  terms  of  the  instrument  under  which  the  plan  is \noperated”).20  By naming the plan administrator in the plan \ninstrument,  the  government  complies  with  ERISA.    The \ngovernment’s  approach  does  not,  contrary  to  Plaintiffs’ \ncontention, amend or alter Plaintiffs’ own plan instruments; \nthe government directs only the contraceptive coverage.   \nThe  self-insured  Plaintiffs  also  contend  that  they  are \nrequired  to  facilitate  access  to  contraceptive  coverage \nbecause,  if  their  existing  TPAs  decline  to  assume  the \nresponsibility  to  provide  contraceptive  coverage,  the \nregulations  obligate  Plaintiffs  to  take  affirmative  steps  to \nidentify  and  contract  with  new  TPAs.    The  district  court \ngranted  summary  judgment  for  Plaintiff  Thomas  Aquinas \nCollege on this ground.  RCAW, 2013 WL 6729515, at *24.  \nUpon de novo review, we reject Thomas Aquinas’s argument \nas premature.  Thomas Aquinas has not made any showing \nthat  its  TPA  has  any  intention  of  refusing  to  provide \ncontraceptive  coverage  to  its  employees.21    Moreover,  the \n                                                 \n20 ERISA also states that “in the case of a plan for which an \nadministrator  is  not  designated  and  a  plan  sponsor  cannot  be \nidentified,” the administrator is “such other person as the Secretary \n[of  Labor]  may  by  regulation  prescribe.”    29  U.S.C. \n§ 1002(16)(A)(iii). \n21 See 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2713A(b)(2) (“If a [TPA] receives a \ncopy of the self-certification . . . and agrees to enter into or remain \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 44 of 86\n44 \n \ngovernment has clarified that, if an eligible organization’s \nexisting TPA were to decline to assume responsibility for \nproviding  contraceptive  coverage,  the  regulations  do  not \nrequire the eligible organization to identify and contract with \na new one.  See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,880-81.  We believe that \nclarification requires us to vacate the district court’s grant of \nsummary judgment for Thomas Aquinas. \n*  *  * \nIn sum, RFRA grants Plaintiffs a right to be free of any \nunjustified substantial governmental burden on their religious \nexercise.  The regulatory requirement that they use a sheet of \npaper to signal their wish to opt out is not a burden that any \nprecedent allows us to characterize as substantial.  It is as a \nresult of the ACA, and not because of any actions Plaintiffs \nmust  take,  that  Plaintiffs’  employees  are  entitled  to \ncontraceptive coverage provided by third parties and that their \ninsurers  or  TPA  must  provide  it;  RFRA  does  not  entitle \nPlaintiffs to control their employees’ relationships with other \nentities willing to provide health insurance coverage to which \nthe employees are legally entitled.  A religious adherent’s \ndistaste for what the law requires of a third party is not, in \nitself, a substantial burden; that is true even if the third party’s \nconduct  towards  others  offends  the  religious  adherent’s \nsincere religious sensibilities.  The regulations go to great \nlengths  to  separate  Plaintiffs  from  the  provision  of \ncontraceptive coverage.  Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate \na substantial burden on their religious exercise that would \n                                                                                                     \nin a contractual relationship with the eligible organization or its \nplan to provide administrative services for the plan, the [TPA] shall \nprovide  or  arrange  payments  for  contraceptive  services  .  .  .” \n(emphasis added)); 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,880. \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 45 of 86\n45 \n \nsubject  the  contraceptive  coverage  requirement  to  strict \njudicial scrutiny. \nB.  The Accommodation Survives Strict Scrutiny \nWhen the parties filed their initial briefs on appeal, the \ngovernment conceded that this Court’s decision in Gilardi v. \nU.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 733 F.3d 1208 \n(D.C. Cir. 2013), vacated, 134 S. Ct. 2902 (2014), controlled \nthe compelling-interest inquiry here.  Gov. Br. 44.  In Gilardi, \nwe  held  at  the  preliminary  injunction  stage  that,  while  a \nclosely-held,  for-profit  business  corporation  was  not  a \n“person” whose religious exercise was protected by RFRA, \nits individual owners had RFRA rights that were injured by \napplication of the contraceptive coverage requirement to their \nfirm.    733  F.3d  at  1214-19.    Lack  of  a  regulatory \naccommodation  applicable  to  such  religious  objectors \nconstituted a substantial burden, and the government failed to \nestablish a compelling interest that justified it.  Id. at 1219-22.     \nWhile  this  appeal  was  pending,  the  Supreme  Court \nvacated Gilardi in view of its decision in Hobby Lobby.  134 \nS. Ct. 2902 (2014).  The Court also, in Wheaton College v. \nBurwell, 134 S.Ct. 2806 (2014), preliminarily enjoined the \nrequirement  that  a  party  seeking  to  opt  out  use  the  self-\ncertification form as specified in the regulations.  The plaintiff \nin  that  case  already  had  notified  the  government  of  its \neligibility and desire for exemption without using that form, \nand the Court required HHS to accept that as adequate notice.  \nBecause the Court’s decisions and a new Interim Final Rule \nresponding to the Wheaton College order (see 79 Fed. Reg. at \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 46 of 86\n46 \n \n51,092)  unsettled  the  governing  law,  we  requested \nsupplemental briefing.22  \nWe directed the parties to brief the implications for this \nappeal  of  the  intervening  legal  developments.    We \nspecifically requested briefing on the substantial-burden and \nstrict-scrutiny issues, and received such briefing from both \nparties.   \nHobby Lobby’s analysis is instructive, even though the \nsubstantial-burden  and  least-restrictive-means  questions \nposed by the lack of any accommodation available to the \nplaintiffs  in  Hobby  Lobby  are  very  different  from  those \npresented  here,  where  the  government  has  provided  an \naccommodation.  As discussed above, we conclude that the \naccommodation  does  not  impose  a  substantial  burden  on \nPlaintiffs in this case.  See Mich. Catholic Conf., 755 F.3d at \n390; Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at 554-559.  To the extent that the \nSupreme Court’s recent order in Wheaton College might be \nread to signal a different conclusion, analysis of the strict \nscrutiny question is also called for.  The Hobby Lobby Court’s \ndiscussion of the weightiness of the government’s interests is \nin substantial tension with Gilardi’s approach to the strict \nscrutiny analysis.  We thus proceed in light of the intervening \ndecisions to analyze whether the accommodation is the least \nrestrictive means to serve a compelling governmental interest.  \nThe  challenged  regulations  seek  to  ensure  timely  and \neffective access to contraception for all women who want it \nand for whom it is medically appropriate.  The government \ncontends that the regulations are amply supported because \nthey  arise  at  the  intersection  of  overlapping  governmental \ninterests, each of which is compelling:  public health, and \n                                                 \n22 See supra notes 15 & 16. \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 47 of 86\n47 \n \nwomen’s well-being.  The government claims an interest in \nindependently  assuring  seamless  contraceptive  coverage, \nregardless of whether the insured woman receives her other \nhealth  insurance  coverage  through  her  (or  her  family \nmember’s) employment at a religious nonprofit that objects to \nproviding it.   \nThe  Supreme  Court’s  characterizations  of  the \ngovernment’s  asserted  compelling  interest  and  the  narrow \ntailoring of the accommodation were dicta in Hobby Lobby.  \nThe accommodation was not challenged there; it was only \nadverted to as a potential remedy for the non-accommodated \nplaintiffs  in  that  case.    As  next  discussed,  however,  the \nCourt’s characterizations are consistent with our conclusions \nthat  (1)  the  contraceptive  coverage  requirement—and, \nspecifically,  its  guarantee  for  employees  whose  employers \npartake of the accommodation—is supported by compelling \ngovernmental  interests,  and  (2)  it  imposes  no  unnecessary \nconstraints on Plaintiffs’ religious exercise. \n1.  The  Government  Has  Demonstrated  Compelling \nInterests  That  Support  Seamless  Provision  of \nContraceptive Coverage \nIn  promulgating  the  challenged  regulations,  the \ngovernment  asserted  an  interest  in  supporting  women’s \nunhindered, cost-free access to contraceptive services.  See 78 \nFed. Reg. at 39,887-88.  The Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby \nassumed, without deciding, that the governmental interest in \n“guaranteeing  cost-free  access”  to  contraception  was \n“compelling.”  Hobby  Lobby,  134  S.  Ct.  at  2780.    Five \nmembers of the Court separately signed onto opinions that \nappear to be more affirmative.  Justice Kennedy, concurring, \nfound  it  “important  to  confirm”  that  the  “premise  of  the \nCourt’s opinion is its assumption that the HHS regulation \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 48 of 86\n48 \n \nhere at issue furthers a legitimate and compelling interest in \nthe health of female employees.” Id. at 2786.  He noted that \nthe  government  “makes  the  case”  that  the  contraceptive \ncoverage requirement “serves the Government’s compelling \ninterest in providing insurance coverage that is necessary to \nprotect  the  health  of  female  employees,  coverage  that  is \nsignificantly more costly than for a male employee.”  Id. at \n2785-86.    Justice  Ginsburg,  writing  for  four  dissenting \njustices,  recounted  the  government’s  evidence  establishing \nthe importance of contraception to a range of women’s health \nneeds, and concluded that contraceptive coverage under the \nACA  “furthers  compelling  interests  in  public  health  and \nwomen’s well being.”  Id. at 2799-2800. \nThere  is  no  simple  formula  for  identifying  which \ngovernmental  interests  rank  as  compelling,  but  certain \ntouchstones  aid  our  analysis.    Interests  in  public  health, \nsafety, and welfare—and the viability of public programs that \nguard  those  interests—may  qualify  as  compelling,  as  may \nlegislative measures to protect and promote women’s well \nbeing and remedy the extent to which health insurance has not \nserved women’s specific health needs as fully as those of \nmen.   \nThe government’s asserted compelling interest here, writ \nlarge, is in a sustainable system of taxes and subsidies under \nthe ACA to advance public health.  That interest is as strong \nas those asserted in cases such as United States v. Lee, 455 \nU.S. 252, 258 (1982), and Hernandez v. Comm’r of Internal \nRevenue,  490  U.S.  680,  699-700  (1989),  recognizing \ngovernmental interests in broad participation in public tax and \nbenefits  systems  as  sufficiently  compelling  to  outweigh \ncountervailing  claims  that  they  unjustifiably  burdened \nreligious exercise.   \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 49 of 86\n49 \n \nIn Lee, the Supreme Court held that the government’s \ninterest  in  a  nationwide  social  security  system  was \nsufficiently weighty to require that an Amish employer pay \nunemployment  and  social  security  taxes,  even  though  the \nCourt acknowledged that doing so would burden the Amish \nemployer’s religious beliefs.  455 U.S. at 258.  The Court \nobserved that the social security system “serves the public \ninterest by providing a comprehensive insurance system with \na variety of benefits available to all participants, with costs \nshared by employers and employees.”  Id.  The system would \nnot have been viable unless broad participation was required, \nand the Court held that the governmental interest “in assuring \nmandatory and continuous participation in and contribution to \nthe  social  security  system”  sufficed  to  justify  the \nacknowledged burden on the employer’s religious exercise.  \nId. at 258-59.   \nSo, too, in Hernandez, the Court rejected a claim that \ndenial  of  certain  tax  deductions  violated  the  plaintiffs’ \nreligious exercise because “even a substantial burden [on the \nexercise of religion] would be justified by the broad public \ninterest in maintaining a sound tax system.” 490 U.S. at 699-\n700  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).    The  government \nconcluded that the success of the ACA’s effort to expand \naccess to health care, improve outcomes, and control costs \nsimilarly  depends  on  widespread  use  of  preventive  care, \nwhich  the  Act  encourages  by  requiring  that  particular \npreventive measures be provided free of cost.  See 78 Fed. \nReg. at 39,872.  \nThe  Supreme  Court’s  recognition  of  compelling \ngovernmental interests in the physical health and safety of the \npublic,  albeit  in  factually  very  different  contexts,  further \nsupports  the  gravity  of  the  government’s  interest  in  the \ncontraceptive  coverage  requirement.    See,  e.g.,  Prince  v. \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 50 of 86\n50 \n \nMassachusetts,  321  U.S.  158,  165-67  (1944);  Jacobson  v. \nMassachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 25 (1905).  The Court in Prince \nsustained child labor laws against a free exercise challenge \nbased on the government’s paramount interest in protecting \nthe health and welfare of children.  321 U.S. at 165-71.  In \nJacobson, a mandatory, mass vaccination program withstood \na  constitutional  liberty  challenge  because  it  served  the \ngovernment’s interest in “the public health and the public \nsafety.”  197 U.S. at 25-26.  Those cases support the strength \nof  health  interests  behind  the  contraceptive  coverage \nregulations, which include interests in avoiding health risks to \nwomen and children from unplanned pregnancies.  Indeed, \nthese  very  same  interests—pediatric  care  and \nimmunizations—are  protected  by  companion  provisions  to \nthe Women’s Health Amendment in the ACA.  See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 300gg-13(a)(2),  (3).    Under  Plaintiffs’  argument,  and \ncontrary to Prince and Jacobson, those interests could fall to \nthe same type of religious challenge as is leveled here by \norganizations that sincerely object to the types of care they \ncover.  \nThe  Supreme  Court  has  recognized  the  interest  in \neliminating  discrimination  against  women  as  sufficiently \ncompelling  to  justify  incursions  on  rights  to  expressive \nassociation.  See Bd. of Dirs. of Rotary Int’l v. Rotary Club of \nDuarte, 481 U.S. 537, 549 (1987); see also Roberts v. U.S. \nJaycees,  468  U.S.  609,  625-26  (1984)  (recognizing \ncompelling interest in creating “rights of public access” to \nprivate goods and services in order to promote women’s equal \nenjoyment  of  leadership  skills,  business  contacts,  and \nemployment promotions).  Those cases lend gravitas to the \ngovernment’s  interest  in  the  contraceptive  coverage \nrequirement as an effort to eradicate lingering effects of sex \ndiscrimination.  See generally Nev. Dep’t of Human Res. v. \nHibbs, 538 U.S. 721 (2003). \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 51 of 86\n51 \n \nThe  Supreme  Court  majority  in  Hobby  Lobby \ncharacterized the government’s interests in “promoting public \nhealth and gender equality” as “broadly framed” and noted \nthat RFRA “contemplates a more focused inquiry.”  134 S. \nCt.  at  2779  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).    The \ngovernment  has  pathmarked  the  more  focused  inquiry  by \nexplaining  how  those  larger  interests  inform  and  are \nspecifically  implicated  in  its  decision  to  support  women’s \nunhindered access to contraceptive coverage.  We do not take \nthe government to suggest that its interests in “public health” \nand “gender equality” necessarily render compelling every \nsubsidiary governmental action that advances them.  Each of \nthose  interests,  however,  specifically  undergirds  the \ngovernment’s decision here to provide seamless coverage of \ncontraceptive services for women who want them and whose \ndoctors prescribe them.   \nAs we explain below, compelling interests converge to \nsupport the government’s decision, reflected in the challenged \nregulations, to provide cost-free contraceptive coverage and \nto remove administrative and logistical obstacles to accessing \ncontraceptive care.  Those compelling governmental interests \nsuffice to support requiring eligible organizations to ask for \nan accommodation if they want to take advantage of one, so \nthat the government can protect its interests by ensuring that \nthe resulting coverage gaps are filled.   \na. Improving Public Health Through Contraceptive \nCoverage \nThe ACA is an ambitious effort to reform the health care \nsystem in the United States.  It is designed to expand access \nto  comprehensive  insurance  coverage  as  a  means  of \ncontrolling spiraling health care costs while improving health.  \nSee  Cong.  Budget  Office,  Key  Issues  in  Analyzing  Major \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 52 of 86\n52 \n \nHealth Insurance Proposals 1 (2008) (“CBO Report”); see \nalso Remarks by the President at the Annual Conference of \nthe  American  Medical  Association  (June  15,  2009), \nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-\npresident-annual-conference-american-medical-association.  \nThe United States in recent years spent far more on health \ncare than did many other developed nations.  At the same \ntime, the quality of care Americans received was lower and \nour population was no healthier than people in countries that \nspent less.  CBO Report at 1.   \n \nCongress understood that improved health at affordable \ncost  cannot  be  attained  without  increased  reliance  on \npreventive care.  Most people underestimate the importance \nof  prevention  and  are  easily  hindered  from  undertaking \npreventive steps because the costs and effort of preventive \nhealth  care  are  immediate  while  benefits  typically  are \nuncertain and deferred.  Many adverse health conditions and \nan enormous amount of costly care can be avoided if people \nbetter  understand  risky  behavior,  plan  more  carefully,  and \ntake measures to reduce their risks, exposures, and errors.  \nInst.  of  Med.,  Clinical  Preventive  Services  for  Women: \nClosing the Gaps 16-17 (2011) (“IOM Report”).23  Providing \npreventive  care—including  patient  education,  screenings, \npreventive medications and devices, and early treatment—can \nbe less costly than treating advanced diseases and conditions.  \nSee id.; Chronic Diseases and Health Promotion, Centers for \nDisease  Control  and  Prevention, \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/overview/  (last  visited \nNov. 5, 2014); see also CBO Report at 136-38.  Yet, before \nenactment of the ACA, only a small portion of health care \n                                                 \n23  As  noted  above,  the  government  directed  the  HRSA,  in \nconsultation  with  IOM,  to  develop  guidelines  for  women’s \npreventive care services.  This report was part of that effort. \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 53 of 86\n53 \n \nspending went to prevention.  See Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, The Power of Prevention (2009), available at \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/pdf/2009-power-of-\nprevention.pdf.   \n \nCongress  and  the  Executive  Branch  determined  that \nserving the government’s compelling public health interests \ndepends on overcoming the human behavioral tendencies of \ndenial and delay documented in the legislative and regulatory \nrecord.  People tend to eschew preventive care when they \nhave to pay for it, make even minor efforts to learn about and \nenroll  in  new  programs,  keep  multiple  appointments,  or \nfollow new routines.  Because “[i]ndividuals are more likely \nto use preventive services if they do not have to satisfy cost-\nsharing  requirements,”  78  Fed.  Reg.  at  39,872,  the  ACA \nrequires group or individual health plans to include coverage \nfor  a  variety  of  preventive  health  services  without  cost \nsharing.  42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a).  “Studies have . . . shown \nthat even moderate copayments for preventive services” can \n“deter patients from receiving those services.”  IOM Report at \n19.   \nThe government further determined that the imperative \nof providing broad access to preventive care applies with full \nforce  to  women’s  health.    Congress  was  informed  during \ndebates on the ACA that “too many women are delaying or \nskipping preventive care because of the costs of copays and \nlimited access.  In fact, more than half of women delay or \navoid preventive care because of its costs.”  155 Cong. Rec. \n28,843 (2009) (statement of Sen. Gillibrand); see also 155 \nCong. Rec. 28,842-43 (2009) (statement of Sen. Mikulski).  \nIn  light  of  this  reality,  Senator  Mikulski  proposed  the \nWomen’s  Health  Amendment,  which  expanded  the  list  of \npreventive  health  services  the  ACA  required  that  insurers \ncover without cost sharing to include preventive health care \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 54 of 86\n54 \n \nand screenings for women.  155 Cong. Rec. 28,800-02 (2009) \n(codified at 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4)).  Congress in the \nACA  directed  the  HRSA  to  develop  the  list  of  covered \npreventive services.  The HRSA commissioned the IOM to \nidentify  preventive  health  services  with  strong  scientific \nevidence of health benefits.  The IOM’s report recommended \npreventive services it deemed necessary for women’s health \nand  well-being.    HRSA  accepted  IOM’s  findings  and \nrecommendations, and the Departments relied on them when \ncrafting both the exemption and the accommodation. \nThe  HRSA  and  IOM  concluded  that,  given  women’s \nreproductive  health  needs,  preventive  health  services  for \nwomen should include contraceptive coverage.  IOM Report \nat 109-10; see also 77 Fed. Reg. at 8,725.  The government \nrecognized that the cost of reproductive health care, including \ncontraceptives, is significant, and it falls disproportionately \non  women.    78  Fed.  Reg.  at  39,873,  39,887.    The  vast \nmajority  of  women  who  have  sex  with  men  use \ncontraceptives at least some of the time.  See IOM Report at \n103.  Most contraceptives used by women, and the forms that \nare most effective and fully reversible, are available only with \na prescription and in some cases must be administered by a \nmedical professional.  See id. at 105; Kimberly Daniels, et al., \nContraceptive  Methods  Women  Have  Ever  Used:  United \nStates,  1982-2010,  62  Nat’l  Health  Stat.  Rep.  1  (2013), \navailable  at  http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr062.pdf \n(hereinafter  “Daniels”).    Those  forms—including  birth \ncontrol pills, injectable methods, contraceptive patches, and \nintrauterine devices (“IUD”)—have been used at one time or \nanother  by  88  percent  of  women  who  have  had  sexual \nintercourse.  Daniels at 1.   \nThe  Institute  of  Medicine  observed  that  high  costs \nregularly cause women to forego contraception completely or \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 55 of 86\n55 \n \nto choose less effective methods:  “Even small increments in \ncost sharing have been shown to reduce the use of preventive \nservices  .  .  .  .  The  elimination  of  cost  sharing  for \ncontraception  therefore  could  greatly  increase  its  use, \nincluding  the  use  of  the  more  effective  and  longer-acting \nmethods,  especially  among  poor  and  low-income  women \nmost at risk for unintended pregnancy.”  IOM Report at 109; \nsee also 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,873.  Prescription methods of \ncontraception have lower failure rates than non-prescription \nmethods such as condoms, IOM Report at 105, but can be \nquite  expensive.    The  cost  of  an  IUD,  one  of  the  most \nconvenient and effective forms of reversible contraception, is \nnearly  a  month’s  full-time  pay  for  workers  earning  the \nminimum wage, and its cost makes it less likely that women \nwill use it.  Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2800 (Ginsburg, J., \ndissenting).  \nThus  the  government  decided  to  require  contraceptive \ncoverage  without  cost  sharing  because  appropriate  and \nconsistent  use  of  contraceptives  furthers  women  and \nchildren’s health in a variety of ways.  Enabling couples to \ncontrol  the  timing  and  spacing  of  pregnancies  improves \nwomen’s  health  outcomes.    Short  intervals  between \npregnancies  increase  maternal  mortality  and  pregnancy-\nrelated complications.  IOM Report at 103-04.  Even a normal \nand healthy pregnancy is a demanding physical process for a \nwoman.  Pregnancy increases risks of health complications, \nsuch  as  anemia,  gestational  diabetes,  hypertension, \nhyperemesis gravidarum, and even death.  See generally 78 \nFed.  Reg.  at  39,872,  39,887  (stressing  the  importance  of \ncovering preventive care to respond to women’s unique health \nneeds);  Pregnancy  Complications,  Centers  for  Disease \nControl  and  Prevention,  \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/\npregcomplications.htm (last visited Nov. 5, 2014); Pregnancy \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 56 of 86\n56 \n \nRelated Deaths, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/MaternalInfantHealth/\nPregnancy-relatedMortality.htm (last visited Nov. 5, 2014). \nA core reason the government sought under the ACA to \nexpand access to contraception is that use of contraceptives \nreduces unintended pregnancies.  According to the Institute of \nMedicine,  in  2001,  “49  percent  of  all  pregnancies  in  the \nUnited States were unintended.”  IOM Report at 102.  There \nis “an 85 percent chance of an unintended pregnancy within \n12 months among couples using no method of contraception.”  \nId. at 105.  Unintended pregnancies elevate health risks for \nwomen  and  children  and  impose  other  costs  on  society.  \nWomen whose pregnancies are unintended are more likely to \nexperience depression, anxiety, or domestic violence during \nthose pregnancies.  IOM Report at 103; see also Korte v. \nSebelius,  735  F.3d  654,  725  (7th  Cir.  2013)  (Rovner,  J., \ndissenting).    “In  2001,  42  percent  of  U.S.  unintended \npregnancies  ended  in  abortion.”    IOM  Report  at  102.  \nReducing  the  frequency  of  unintended  pregnancies  would \nreduce the frequency of abortions.  78 Fed. Reg. at 39,872; \nsee  also  IOM  Report  at  105.    Supporting  access  to \ncontraception  empowers  women  to  avoid  the  physical \nburdens and risks of pregnancy unless and until they decide to \nundertake them.   \nThe  government  further  relied  on  the  ways  that \ncontraceptive use can promote and improve women’s health \napart  from  their  procreative  health  needs.    Women \ncontraindicated  for  pregnancy,  such  as  those  with  certain \nheart conditions, hypertension, diabetes, Marfan Syndrome, \nor lupus, face health hazards from pregnancy that can be life \nthreatening.  See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,872; IOM Report at 103-\n04;  Hobby  Lobby,  134  S.  Ct.  at  2786  (Kennedy,  J., \nconcurring), id. at 2799 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).

Doctors also recommend that \nwomen taking certain medications that pose risk to maternal \nand  fetal  health  avoid  getting  pregnant.    Hormones \nmanufactured and sold as contraception are also used to treat, \nmanage, or prevent other diseases, such as “certain cancers, \nmenstrual disorders, and pelvic pain.”  Hobby Lobby, 134 S. \nCt. at 2799 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); see also 78 Fed. Reg. \n39,872; IOM Report at 107. \nThe  Institute  of  Medicine  reported  that,  for  similar \nreasons, contraceptive use also promotes the health of infants \nand  children.    Children  who  are  born  as  the  result  of \nunintended  pregnancy  suffer  increased  health  risks  on \naverage, including preterm birth and low birth weight and \nassociated complications.  IOM Report at 103.  Women who \ndo not immediately know they are pregnant, or are ambivalent \nabout bearing children, are more likely to delay prenatal care \nor engage in behaviors that pose pregnancy related risks.  78 \nFed. Reg. at 39,872; IOM Report at 103.  Short intervals \nbetween  pregnancies  also  can  have  serious  health \nconsequences  for  infants,  such  as  low  birth  weight, \nprematurity, and small-for-gestational age.  78 Fed. Reg. at \n38,872; IOM Report at 103.  Women in hazardous jobs or \nprecarious or dangerous living situations may need to delay \npregnancy  in  order  to  reduce  the  health  risks  for  a  child.  \nPermitting women to control the timing and spacing of their \npregnancies  improves  the  health  and  welfare  of  women, \nchildren, and infants.   \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 58 of 86\n58 \n \nb. Assuring Women Equal Benefit of Preventive Care \nBy Requiring Coverage of Their Distinctive Health \nNeeds \nThe government also relied on evidence that advancing \nwomen’s well being by meeting their health needs as fully as \nthose of men was a compelling reason for a contraceptive \ncoverage  requirement.    In  enacting  and  implementing  the \nACA, the government sought to provide coverage that offers \nequal benefit for men and women.  78 Fed. Reg. at 39,887.  \nBefore the ACA, insurance coverage for a female employee \nwas “significantly more costly than for a male employee.”  \nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2786 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  \nWomen paid more for the same health insurance coverage \navailable to men and “in general women of childbearing age \nspen[t] 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care costs \nthan men.”  155 Cong. Rec. 28,843 (2009) (statement of Sen. \nGillibrand); see 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,887.   \nThe government recognized that women pay more for the \nsame health benefits in part because services more important \nor specific to women have not been adequately covered by \nhealth  insurance.    See  155  Cong.  Rec.  28,843  (2009) \n(statement  of  Sen.  Gillibrand).    Contraception  is  a  key \nelement of preventive care for many women, yet the methods \nthat are most reliable and are under a woman’s control require \nprescriptions and are disproportionately more expensive than \nnon-prescription forms of contraception.  See IOM Report at \n105,  108.    Condoms,  which  are  inexpensive  and  widely \navailable over the counter, require men’s cooperation and are \nsubstantially  less  effective  in  pregnancy  prevention  than \nprescription methods.  See id. at 105.  When Congress added \nthe Women’s Health Amendment to the ACA, which requires \ngroup health plans to include preventive health care services \nfor women without cost sharing, it did so precisely to end “the \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 59 of 86\n59 \n \npunitive practices of the private insurance companies in their \ngender discrimination.”  155 Cong. Rec. 28,842 (daily ed. \nDec. 1, 2009) (statement of Sen. Mikulski).  The government \nconcluded that a preventive care package that failed to cover \ncontraception would not give women access, equal to that \nenjoyed  by  men,  to  the  full  range  of  health  care  services \nrecommended for their specific needs.  See 78 Fed. Reg. at \n39,887.   \nFor most women, whether and under what circumstances \nto bear a child is the most important economic decision of \ntheir lives.  An unintended pregnancy is virtually certain to \nimpose  substantial,  unplanned-for  expenses  and  time \ndemands  on  any  family,  and  those  demands  fall \ndisproportionately on women.  As the Supreme Court has \nrecognized “[t]he ability of women to participate equally in \nthe economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated \nby their ability to control their reproductive lives.”  Planned \nParenthood of Se. Penn. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 856 (1992); \n78 Fed. Reg. at 39,873 (“[A]ccess to contraception improves \nthe social and economic status of women.”).  Congress noted \nwhen enacting the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, Pub. L. No. \n95-555, 92 Stat. 2076 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.), \nand Family and Medical Leave Act, Pub. L. No. 103-3, 107 \nStat. 6 (codified at 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq.), a woman’s \nability to get pregnant has led to pervasive discrimination in \nthe workplace.24    \n                                                 \n24 See Hibbs, 538 U.S. at 736 (“‘Historically, denial or curtailment \nof women’s employment opportunities has been traceable directly \nto the pervasive presumption that women are mothers first, and \nworkers second. This prevailing ideology about women’s roles has \nin  turn  justified  discrimination  against  women  when  they  are \nmothers or mothers-to-be.’” (quoting The Parental and Medical \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 60 of 86\n60 \n \nThe government has amply substantiated its compelling \ninterests  in  the  accommodation.        The  government  has \noverlapping and mutually reinforcing compelling interests in \npromoting  public  health  and  gender  equality.    The \ncontraceptive  coverage  requirement  specifically  advances \nthose interests.  It was adopted to promote women’s equal \naccess to health care appropriate to their needs, which in turn \nserves women’s health, the health of children, and women’s \nequal enjoyment of their right to personal autonomy without \nunwanted pregnancy.  We hold that the accommodation is \nsupported  by  the  government’s  compelling  interest  in \nproviding women full and equal benefits of preventive health \ncoverage, including contraception and other health services of \nparticular relevance to women.     \n2.  The Regulations Use the Least Restrictive  \nMeans to Ensure Contraceptive Coverage  \nWhile Accommodating Religious Exercise \n \nIn  addition  to  calling  on  us  to  inquire  whether  the \nchallenged  contraceptive  coverage  requirement  serves  a \ncompelling interest, RFRA demands that we guard against \nunnecessary  impositions  on  religious  exercise  by  carefully \nexamining the particular way the government has gone about \nserving  that  interest.    The  Departments  designed  the \nchallenged  accommodation  for  eligible  organizations  fully \ncognizant of RFRA’s mandate.  See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,886-\n                                                                                                     \nLeave Act of 1986: Joint Hearing before the Subcommittee on \nLabor–Management  Relations  and  the  Subcommittee  on  Labor \nStandards of the House Committee on Education and Labor, 99th \nCong., 2d Sess., 100 (1986)); see also S. Rep. No. 95-331, at 3 \n(1977) (“A failure to address discrimination based on pregnancy, in \nfringe benefits or in any other employment practice, would prevent \nthe elimination of sex discrimination in employment.”). \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 61 of 86\n61 \n \n88.    As  already  described,  the  accommodation  excuses \neligible  organizations  from  the  contraceptive  coverage \nrequirement,  severs  them  from  any  involvement  in  the \nseparate contraceptive coverage to which the employees are \nentitled, and specifies that employees must be notified that the \nobjecting  organizations  have  no  involvement  in  providing \ntheir contraceptive coverage. \n  Adverting to this accommodation in Hobby Lobby, the \nSupreme Court stressed that it alleviates the burden on the \nplaintiffs  of  having  to  provide  contraceptive  coverage  and \n“serves HHS’s stated interests equally well.”  Hobby Lobby, \n134 S. Ct. at 2782.  The Court described the accommodation \nas “an alternative that achieves all of the Government’s aims \nwhile providing greater respect for religious liberty.” Id. at \n2759;  see  id.  at  2786  (Kennedy,  J.,  concurring)  (the \n“accommodation equally furthers the Government’s interest \nbut does not impinge on the plaintiff’s religious beliefs”).  In \nfact, the Court explained that the effect of the accommodation \non women “would be precisely zero.”  Id. at 2760. \nIn  determining  whether  the  government  has  used  the \nleast restrictive means, the Supreme Court has instructed that \nwe  focus  on  the  context  of  the  religious  objectors,  and \nconsider  whether  and  how  the  government’s  compelling \ninterest  is  harmed  by  “‘granting  specific  exemptions  to \nparticular religious claimants.’”  Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at \n2779 (quoting Gonzales  v.  O  Centro  Espírita  Beneficiente \nUniao Do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 431 (2006)).

Only if the eligible organizations \ncommunicate that they are dropping contraceptive coverage \nfrom  the  health  insurance  they  have  arranged  for  their \nemployees will the government be able to ensure that the \nresultant gaps in employees’ coverage are otherwise filled.  \nThe government contends that its interests would be impaired \nif eligible organizations were entitled to exempt themselves \nfrom  the  contraceptive  coverage  requirement  without \nnotifying either HHS, or their insurers or TPAs. \nThe government has an interest in the uniformity of the \nhealth care system the ACA put in place, under which all \neligible citizens receive the same minimum level of coverage.  \nLike the Social Security system at issue in Lee, the ACA \n“serves  the  public  interest  by  providing  a  comprehensive \ninsurance system with a variety of benefits available to all \nparticipants.”  455 U.S. at 258.  Contraceptive coverage must \nbe  effective  if  it  is  to  serve  the  government’s  compelling \ninterests, and the Departments were justified in concluding \nthat, to be effective, the coverage must be provided to all \nwomen who want it, on the same terms as other preventive \ncare.  Providing contraceptive services seamlessly together \nwith other health services, without cost sharing or additional \nadministrative  or  logistical  burdens  and  within  a  system \nfamiliar to women, is necessary to serve the government’s \ninterest in effective access.  Imposing even minor added steps \nwould  dissuade  women  from  obtaining  contraceptives  and \ndefeat the compelling interests in enhancing access to such \ncoverage.  See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,888.  \nThe  evidence  shows  that  contraceptive  use  is  highly \nvulnerable  to  even  seemingly  minor  obstacles.

Pls.’ R. Br. 22.  Those alternatives would \nsubstantially  impair  the  government’s  interest.    Plaintiffs’ \nproposed  alternatives  each  would  add  steps—requiring \nwomen  to  identify  different  providers  or  reimbursement \nsources, enroll in additional and unfamiliar programs, pay out \nof pocket and wait for reimbursement, or file for tax credits \n(assuming their income made them eligible)—or pose other \nfinancial,  logistical,  informational,  and  administrative \nburdens.  See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39,888.  Even assuming that any \nalternative program had or would develop the capacity to deal \nwith an enormous additional constituency, it would not serve \nthe government’s compelling interest with anywhere near the \nefficacy of the challenged accommodation and would instead \ndeter women from accessing contraception.  See id.   \nPlaintiffs  also  dispute  the  government’s  compelling \ninterest in applying the contraceptive coverage requirement to \nthem on the ground that there is “no evidence” showing that \nPlaintiffs’ employees lack access to or want contraception.  \nPls.’ Supp’l Br. 16-17.  The data upon which the government \nrelies  support  its  conclusion  that  women  generally  benefit \nfrom access to contraceptive coverage, and are unlikely to use \nsuch coverage when it is costly or complicated to obtain.  See \n78 Fed. Reg. at 39,887-88.  There is no reason to believe that \nthe health needs of Plaintiffs’ employees or spouses and other \ncovered beneficiaries in their families are materially different \nfrom those of other women.  Religious nonprofits like the \nPlaintiff  organizations  employ  millions  of  Americans—\nincluding individuals who do not share their beliefs.  As the \ngovernment recognized, “[e]mployers that do not primarily \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 64 of 86\n64 \n \nemploy  employees  who  share  the  religious  tenets  of  the \norganization are more likely to employ individuals who have \nno religious objection to the use of contraceptive services and \ntherefore are more likely to use contraceptives.”  77 Fed. Reg. \nat 8,728.  The evidence justifying the contraceptive coverage \nrequirement equally supports its application to Plaintiffs. \nAccommodating religious entities need not come at the \ncost  of  the  compelling  interests  the  government  program \nserves.  When the interests of religious adherents collide with \nan individual’s access to a government program supported by \na  compelling  interest,  RFRA  calls  on  the  government  to \nreconcile  the  competing  interests.    In  so  doing,  however, \nRFRA does not permit religious exercise to “unduly restrict \nother persons, such as employees, in protecting their own \ninterests, interests the law deems compelling.”  Hobby Lobby, \n134 S. Ct. at 2786-87 (Kennedy, J., concurring); see also id. \nat 2781 n.37 (“It is certainly true that in applying RFRA \n‘courts must take adequate account of the burdens a requested \naccommodation may impose on nonbeneficiaries.’”).  The opt \nout offered to religious adherents allows the government to \nfurther its compelling interests with the least restriction on \nreligious  exercise.    Under  the  accommodation,  eligible \norganizations  are  relieved  of  the  obligation  to  include \ncontraceptive coverage in their health care plans, but “women \nwould still be entitled to all FDA-approved contraceptives \nwithout  cost  sharing.”    Id.  at  2760.    Allowing  eligible \norganizations  to  exempt  themselves  completely  from  the \ncontraceptive  coverage  requirement,  without  so  much  as \nnotifying their plan or HHS that they have done so, would \nundermine the government’s interest in the breadth of the \nscheme established in the ACA.  \nThe government’s interest in a comprehensive, broadly \navailable system is not undercut by the other exemptions in \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 65 of 86\n65 \n \nthe ACA, such as the exemptions for religious employers, \nsmall employers, and grandfathered plans.  The government \ncan have an interest in the uniform application of a law, even \nif that law allows some exceptions.  See, e.g., Lee, 455 U.S. at \n261.  In any event, the exemptions to the ACA are limited and \nthe rationales that support them do not extend to exempting \nPlaintiffs.    Currently,  only  religious  employers’  plans  and \ngrandfathered health plans (employer health plans that existed \nprior to March 23, 2010, and that have not made particular \nchanges after that date) are not required to include coverage \nfor preventive services.  42 U.S.C. § 18011(a), (e).  Religious \nemployers  are  exempt  from  the  contraceptive  coverage \nprovision because the government reasonably assumed that if \nthe  church  opposed  contraception,  the  church’s  employees \nwould, too.  See 77 Fed. Reg. at 8,728.  The exception for \ngrandfathered plans sought to limit disruption by enabling \nindividuals temporarily to maintain their health care coverage \nas it existed prior to enactment of the ACA.  That exception is \na transitional measure and will be eliminated as employers \nmake changes to their health care plans.  See 45 C.F.R. § \n147.140(g) (a health plan ceases to be a grandfathered plan \nwhen  it  eliminates  benefits,  increases  cost-sharing \nrequirements,  or  changes  its  employer-contribution  terms).  \nAccording to HHS estimates, 66 percent of small-employer \nplans and 45 percent of large-employer plans were expected \nto lose their grandfathered status by the end of 2013.25  75 \n                                                 \n25 According to a 2013 study conducted by Kaiser Health News, the \ngrandfathering is already quickly phasing down. Thirty-six percent \nof  individuals  who  receive  health  care  coverage  through  their \nemployer in 2013 were enrolled in a grandfathered health plan, as \ncompared to 48 percent in 2012 and 56 percent in 2011.  Employer \nHealth Benefits: 2013 Annual Survey, Kaiser Family Foundation \nand Health Research & Educational Trust, at 221, available at \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 66 of 86\n66 \n \nFed. Reg. 34,538, 34,552 (June 17, 2010).  The exemption for \nsmall employers (those with fewer than 50 employees) is not \nan exemption from the contraceptive coverage requirement, \nbut from the requirement to provide any health insurance to \ntheir employees.  26 U.S.C. § 4980H(c)(2).  Employees who \ndo not get insurance through their jobs because they work for \nexempt small employers are eligible to purchase it through \nthe exchanges, where all listed plans are required to cover \ncontraceptive services without cost sharing.  None of the three \nexemptions is analogous to what the Plaintiffs here seek. \n*  *  * \nThe  accommodation  is  the  least  restrictive  method  of \nensuring  that  women  continue  to  receive  contraceptive \ncoverage  in  a  seamless  manner  while  simultaneously \nrelieving  the  eligible  organizations  of  any  obligation  to \nprovide such coverage.  Because the government has used the \nleast  restrictive  means  possible  to  further  its  compelling \ninterest,  RFRA  does  not  excuse  Plaintiffs  from  their  duty \nunder the ACA either to provide the required contraceptive \ncoverage or avail themselves of the offered accommodation to \nopt out of that requirement.  The accommodation meets the \ntwin aims of respecting religious freedom and ensuring that \nwomen continue to receive contraceptive coverage without \nadministrative,  financial,  or  logistical  burdens.    The \nregulations  thus  respond  appropriately  to  RFRA’s  explicit \ndemand for “sensible balances between religious liberty and \ncompeting  prior  governmental  interests.”    42  U.S.C. \n§ 2000bb(a)(5). \n                                                                                                     \nhttp://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/8465-\nemployer-health-benefits-20131.pdf.   \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 67 of 86\n67 \n \nV.  Constitutional Claims \nPlaintiffs  raise  several  constitutional  challenges  to  the \nregulations.  We address each in turn, concluding that the \nregulations do not violate any of the constitutional provisions \nidentified by Plaintiffs.   \nA.  Free Exercise of Religion \nPlaintiffs  claim  that  the  contraceptive  coverage \nrequirement violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First \nAmendment  because  it  categorically  exempts  houses  of \nworship  from  the  contraceptive  coverage  requirement  and \ntemporarily relieves grandfathered plans from the requirement \nto cover any preventive services without cost sharing, while \nnot similarly exempting Plaintiffs.  The Free Exercise Clause \nembodies a “fundamental nonpersecution principle.”  Church \nof the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. \n520, 523 (1993).  But it “does not relieve an individual of the \nobligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general \napplicability  on  the  ground  that  the  law  proscribes  (or \nprescribes)  conduct  that  his  religion  prescribes  (or \nproscribes).”    Smith,  494  U.S.  at  879  (internal  quotation \nmarks  omitted).    A  Free  Exercise  Clause  challenge,  in \ncontrast to a claim under RFRA, receives strict scrutiny only \nif the challenged law is either not neutral or not generally \napplicable.  See Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 531.  We have \nheld that the regulations comply with RFRA; they readily \nsatisfy the less stringent free exercise standard. \n“Neutrality  and  general  applicability  are  interrelated,” \nbut distinct.  Id.  A law is not neutral if it facially “refers to a \nreligious practice without a secular meaning discernable from \nthe language or context,” or if “the object of a law is to \ninfringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 68 of 86\n68 \n \nmotivation.”  Id. at 533.  A law is not generally applicable if, \n“in  a  selective  manner,”  it  “impose[s]  burdens  only  on \nconduct motivated by religious belief.”  Id. at 543.   \nPlaintiffs  do  not  contend  that  the  challenged \ncontraceptive coverage requirement is religiously non-neutral \non  its  face,  nor  that  it  was  enacted  for  an  anti-religious \npurpose,  but  that  the  exemptions  provided  to  houses  of \nworship  and  grandfathered  plans  render  the  contraceptive \ncoverage  requirement  non-neutral  and  not  generally \napplicable.  Those exemptions, however, do not impugn the \ncontraceptive  coverage  requirement’s  neutrality  and \ngenerality:  it is both, in the relevant sense of not selectively \ntargeting religious conduct, whether facially or intentionally, \nand broadly applying across religious and nonreligious groups \nalike.  See Mich. Catholic Conf., 755 F.3d at 394; RCAW, \n2013 WL 6729515, at *27-31; Priests for Life, 7 F. Supp. 3d \nat 105-07.   \nThe contraceptive coverage requirement is a religiously \nneutral part of a national effort to expand health coverage and \nmake it more efficient and effective.  The ACA’s limited or \ntemporary exemptions do not amount to the kind of pattern of \nexemptions from a facially neutral law that demonstrate that \nthe  law  was  motivated  by  a  discriminatory  purpose.    See \nsupra  Section  IV.B.2.    The  Florida  prohibition  on  animal \nkilling invalidated in Lukumi Babalu, by contrast, responded \nto the opening of a Santeria church, which practiced religious \nanimal-sacrifice rituals.  508  U.S. at 524.   The ordinance \nelaborated a putatively general prohibition on animal killings \nwith specific disapproval of killing for “sacrifice” as part of \n“any type of ritual,” while exempting as “necessary” killings \nfor  sport  hunting,  slaughtering  animals  to  eat  them, \neradication of pests, and euthanasia—killings that were “no \nmore  necessary  or  humane”  than  the  forbidden  Santeria \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 69 of 86\n69 \n \nsacrifices.  Id. at 536-37.  That exemption for so many non-\nreligious types of animal killing helped to make clear that \n“suppression of the central element of the Santeria worship \nservice was the object of the ordinances.”  Id. at 534.  The \nexemptions in the ACA do not single out any religion and are \nwholly consistent with the law’s neutral purpose.  Indeed, the \nexistence  of  an  exemption  for  religious  employers \nsubstantially  undermines  contentions  that  government  is \nhostile toward such employers’ religion.26   \nThe  contraceptive  coverage  requirement  also  does  not \ntarget religious organizations, but applies across the board.  \nThe exemptions do not render the law so under-inclusive as to \nbelie the government’s interest in protecting public health and \npromoting women’s well-being or to suggest that disfavoring \nCatholic or other pro-life employers was its objective.  See \nRCAW,  2013  WL  6729515,  at  *30.    For  example,  the \nSupreme Court has held that, despite statutory exemptions for \nself-employed Amish employers, the social security system \nwas “uniformly applicable to all.”  United States v. Lee, 455 \nU.S. 252, 260-61 (1982); see also id. at 262 (Stevens, J., \nconcurring in the judgment) (describing the challenged law as \n“a  valid  tax  law  that  is  entirely  neutral  in  its  general \napplication”).    As  the  Sixth  Circuit  recently  explained:  \n“General applicability does not mean absolute universality.”  \n                                                 \n26 See, e.g., RCAW, 2013 WL 6729515, at *28 (availability of the \nreligious employer exemption “cuts against the conclusion that the \ncontraceptive mandate was specifically designed to oppress those \nof the Catholic faith as plaintiffs suggest”); Catholic Diocese of \nNashville v. Sebelius, No. 3:13-01303, 2013 WL 6834375, at *6 \n(M.D. Tenn. Dec. 26, 2013) (noting that exemption for religious \nemployers  and  accommodation  for  eligible  organizations \n“evidences an intent, not to burden Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs, but \nto recognize and respect them”). \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 70 of 86\n70 \n \nMich.  Catholic  Conf.,  755  F.3d  at  394  (internal  quotation \nmarks omitted). \nPlaintiffs contend that the ACA’s exemptions make it \nunder-inclusive in a way that suggests that the government \nbelieves  that  “secular  motivations  [for  providing  an \nexemption] are more important than religious motivations,” \nPls.’ Br. 50 (internal quotation marks omitted), evidencing \nthat the government “devalues religious reasons,” Pls.’ R. Br. \n25  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).    But,  for  the  same \nreasons the exemptions do not undermine the government’s \ninterest in a uniform system, see supra Section IV.B.2, the \nexemptions  do  not  demonstrate  the  government’s  hostility \ntoward religious concerns.     \nBecause  the  contraceptive  coverage  requirement  is  a \nneutral law of general applicability, Plaintiffs’ free exercise \nclaim fails. \nB.  Expressive Association \nThe Priests for Life Plaintiffs argue that the contraceptive \ncoverage requirement violates their First Amendment rights \nto  expressive  association,  which  protects  the  “right  to \nassociate  for  the  purpose  of  speaking.”    See  Rumsfeld  v. \nForum for Academic & Institutional Rights, Inc. (FAIR), 547 \nU.S. 47, 68 (2006).  The regulations infringe that right, the \nPriests  for  Life  Plaintiffs  contend,  by  requiring  them  to \npromote the government’s immoral objective of expanding \naccess to contraceptives, which undermines the organization’s \n“very reason for its existence.”  Pls.’ Br. 51.  The Priests for \nLife Plaintiffs base their expressive association claim, like \ntheir RFRA claim, on a misreading of what the regulations \nrequire of them, suggesting that the regulations require them \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 71 of 86\n71 \n \nto  disclose  the  identities  of  their  employees  and  plan \nbeneficiaries.  See, e.g., Pls.’ Br. 52-53.  They do not.  \nA  law  may  violate  the  First  Amendment  right  to \nexpressive  association  where  it  directly  interferes  with  an \nexpressive  association’s  membership  decisions  or  where  it \nindirectly  affects  the  group’s  composition  by  making \nmembership less attractive.  FAIR, 547 U.S. at 69.  In FAIR, \nthe  Supreme  Court  held  that  a  law  requiring  law  schools \nreceiving federal funds to give military recruiters access to \nthe schools’ facilities equal to the access it afforded other \nrecruiting employers did not violate the objecting schools’ \nrights to associate.   Id. at 69-70.  The law schools’ non-\ndiscrimination  policies  prohibited  discrimination  based  on \nsexual orientation, and, because the United States Military \nrefused  at  that  time  to  hire  any  openly  gay  or  lesbian \napplicants, the law schools were strongly opposed to hosting \nmilitary recruiters and actively facilitating their access to the \nschools’ students.  The Court rejected that claim, holding that \nthe military recruiters’ presence on campus “does not violate \na law school’s right to associate, regardless of how repugnant \nthe law school considers the recruiter’s message.”  Id. at 70.   \nThe  Court  acknowledged  that  the  plaintiffs  there  had  to \n“‘associate’  with  military  recruiters  in  the  sense  that  they \ninteract with them,” but held that, because the recruiters were \nas an institutional matter outsiders who would “come onto \ncampus for the limited purpose of trying to hire students,” \nthey did not impinge on the schools’ expressive association.  \nId. at 69.   \nThe same is true here:  the Priests for Life Plaintiffs \nobject to interacting with coverage providers that must make \ncontraceptive coverage available, but such interaction does \nnot make those providers part of the organization’s expressive \nassociation  or  otherwise  impair  its  ability  to  express  its \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 72 of 86\n72 \n \nmessage.  Just as the students and faculty in FAIR remained \n“free to associate to voice their disapproval of” the military’s \npolicy against gays or lesbians serving openly in the military, \nid.  at  69-70,  Priests  for  Life’s  members  and  employees \nremain  free  to  associate  with  each  other  to  promote  their \nreligious views on contraception and other matters, and to \nvoice their disapproval of health-care products and services \nthat  they  believe  to  be  immoral.    “Nothing  in  the[]  final \nregulations prohibits an eligible organization from expressing \nits opposition to the use of contraceptives.”  78 Fed. Reg. at \n39,880  n.41.    Accordingly,  the  Priests  for  Life  Plaintiffs’ \nexpressive association claim fails. \nC.  Compelled Speech \nIt is “a basic First Amendment principle that freedom of \nspeech  prohibits  the  government  from  telling  people  what \nthey must say.”  Agency for Int’l Dev. v. Alliance for Open \nSoc’y  Int’l,  Inc.,  133  S.  Ct.  2321,  2327  (2013)  (internal \nquotation  marks  omitted);  see  Knox  v.  Serv.  Emps.  Int’l \nUnion,  Local  1000,  132  S.  Ct.  2277,  2282  (2012)  (“The \ngovernment may not . . . compel the endorsement of ideas that \nit  approves.”).    Plaintiffs  contend  that  the  regulations \nimpermissibly compel their speech in three ways.   \nFirst, Plaintiffs claim that the regulations require them to \nauthorize and facilitate health care coverage for counseling \nthat encourages and promotes contraception, in violation of \ntheir  right  against  compelled  speech.    Plaintiffs  appear  to \ncontend that the regulations commandeer them to echo or \nfacilitate  the  words  of  medical  professionals  who  might \ncommunicate to insured women the availability and potential \nappropriateness of various contraceptive methods.  But the \nregulations do not require Plaintiffs to communicate any pro-\ncontraceptive-coverage message, nor to authorize or facilitate \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 73 of 86\n73 \n \ncounseling  in  favor  of  contraception.    See  supra  Section \nIV.A.2; Mich. Catholic Conf., 755 F.3d at 391.  They leave \nPlaintiffs free to voice their opposition to contraception.        \nPlaintiffs’ reliance on Arizona Free Enterprise Club’s \nFreedom Club PAC v. Bennett, 131 S. Ct. 2806 (2011), is \nmisplaced.  Arizona Free Enterprise Club concerned a state \ncampaign finance law under which candidates for state office \nwho accepted public funding could receive additional state \nfunds  in  the  event  that  privately  financed  candidates  and \nindependent  expenditure  groups  exceeded  spending  limits.  \nSee id. at 2813.  Under Arizona’s law, the volume of political \nexpenditures  by  or  in  support  of  a  privately  financed \ncandidate triggered funding to his or her opponent.  See id. at \n2818-19.  Plaintiffs’ completion of the self-certification form \nhas no similar triggering role, and there is no interest or effect \nhere to level competing voices, which was a significant aspect \nof the constitutional infirmity of Arizona’s campaign finance \nlaw.  See id. at 2825.  Furthermore, contrary to Plaintiffs’ \nargument, nothing in Arizona Free Enterprise Club suggests \nthat  the  prohibition  on  compelling  a  party  to  “help \ndisseminate hostile views” the party opposes, id. at 2821 n.8 \n(internal  quotation  marks  omitted),  applies  to  laws  that \nrequire a party to engage in non-expressive behavior, such as \nthe provision of health insurance. \nSecond,  Plaintiffs  argue  that  completing  the  self-\ncertification form requires them to express a particular view, \nnamely,  that  they  oppose  providing  their  plan  participants \nwith coverage for contraceptive services, and that it deprives \nthem of the freedom to speak on this issue on their own \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 74 of 86\n74 \n \nterms.27  The self-certification form and alternative notice are \nthe  methods  through  which  Plaintiffs  can  opt  out  of  the \nrequirement to provide their employees with health insurance \ncoverage for contraceptive services.  The filing of the form, \nthough it may include “elements of speech,” is “a far cry from \nthe compelled speech” that the Supreme Court previously has \nfound to be unconstitutional.  FAIR, 547 U.S. at 61-62 (citing \nW. Va. Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943), and \nWooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 717 (1977)).  Just as the \ncompelled speech that the law schools identified in FAIR was \n“plainly incidental to the Solomon Amendment’s regulation \nof  conduct,”  id.  at  62,  any  speech  required  by  the  self-\ncertification or alternative notice is similarly incidental to the \naccommodation’s  regulation  of  conduct.    Compelling  an \norganization to send a form to a third party to claim eligibility \nfor an exemption “is simply not the same as forcing a student \nto  pledge  allegiance,  or  forcing  a  Jehovah’s  Witness  to \ndisplay the motto ‘Live Free or Die,’ and it trivializes the \nfreedom protected in Barnette and Wooley to suggest that it \nis.”  Id.  Requiring Plaintiffs to give notice that they wish to \nopt out of the contraceptive coverage requirement no more \ncompels their speech in violation of the First Amendment \nthan  does  demanding  that  a  conscientious  objector  self-\nidentify as such.      \nThe regulations do nothing to deprive Plaintiffs of “the \nfreedom to speak on the issue of abortion and contraception \non  their  own  terms,  at  a  time  and  place  of  their  own \nchoosing.”  Pls.’ Br. at 55.   Completing the self-certification \nform  does  not  limit  what  Plaintiffs  may  say  about \ncontraception—or any other topic—nor does it limit where, \n                                                 \n27  Plaintiffs’  briefing  contends  only  that  their  speech  is \nimpermissibly compelled by the self-certification form, and does \nnot address their compelled speech claim to the alternative notice. \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 75 of 86\n75 \n \nwhen, or how they may say it.  See Mich. Catholic Conf., 755 \nF.3d at 392.  Indeed, unlike the law schools in FAIR that had \nto host military recruiters and thus might have mistakenly \nbeen  viewed  as  endorsing  the  military’s  discriminatory \nrecruitment approach, the opt out here is designed to ensure \nthat Plaintiffs do not have to express, in words or symbolic \nbacking, any support for contraception.  Cf. FAIR, 547 U.S. at \n64-65  (government  is  limited  in  its  “ability  to  force  one \nspeaker to host or accommodate another speaker’s message” \nwhere  accommodating  that  message  interferes  with  the \nplaintiff’s desired message).  \nFinally, Plaintiffs object to the regulations because they \nrequire that Plaintiffs’ plan participants receive notice of the \navailability  of  payments  for contraceptive  services.    Thus, \naccording to Plaintiffs, the regulations coerce them to provide \naccess  to  their  plan  participants  and  either  create  the \nappearance that Plaintiffs agree with the notification or call \non them to respond to the notice to inform participants of \nPlaintiffs’ objections to contraception.   \nBut the regulations actually require quite the contrary:  \nthe  plan  issuer  or  TPA  must  send  a  message  explicitly \ndistancing  the  employer  from  the  offered  contraceptive \ncoverage, and do so in a completely separate mailing from \nany communication regarding the employer-sponsored plan.  \n45  C.F.R.  § 147.131(d)  (insured  group  health  plans);  29 \nC.F.R.  § 2590.715-2713A(d)  (self-insured  plans).    The \nregulations, therefore, take care to inform plan participants \nthat  the  coverage  for  contraceptives  is  not  paid  for, \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 76 of 86\n76 \n \nadministered by, or connected to Plaintiffs.  That is a long \nway from unconstitutionally compelling Plaintiffs to speak.28  \nD.  Establishment of Religion \nPlaintiffs  advance  two  Establishment  Clause  claims.  \nThey  first  contend  that  the  regulations  impermissibly \ndiscriminate between types of religious institutions by making \na general distinction, familiar in tax law, between churches \nand  other  houses  of  worship  (which  are  automatically \nexempt),  and  nonprofit  organizations  that  may  have  a \nreligious  character  or  affiliation,  such  as  universities  and \nhospitals (which may use the accommodation to opt out).  26 \nU.S.C. § 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii) (exempting “churches, their \nintegrated  auxiliaries,  and  conventions  or  associations  of \nchurches,”  and  “the  exclusively  religious  activities  of  any \n                                                 \n28  The  RCAW  Plaintiffs  challenged  the  regulations’  “non-\ninterference” provision as an unconstitutional speech restriction, \nbut as that provision has been rescinded, their challenge is moot.  \nThe  provision  originally  barred  self-insured  employers  from \n“directly or indirectly, seek[ing] to influence the [TPA’s] decision” \nto provide or arrange separate payments for contraceptive services.  \n79 Fed. Reg. at 51,095.  The government interpreted that bar as \napplicable  only  to  the  use  of  bribery,  threats,  or  coercion  to \ndissuade or hinder a TPA from fulfilling its legal obligation to \nprovide contraceptive coverage.  Id.  The government has now \nrescinded  the  non-interference  provision  in  its  entirety.    Id.  \nPlaintiffs  maintain  that  they  still  challenge  the  non-interference \nprovision “to the extent the Government contends it continues to be \nunlawful to ‘say to the[ir] TPA, if you don’t stop making the \npayments  for  contraceptives,  we’re  going  to  fire  you.’”    Pls.’ \nSupp’l Br. 27 n.12 (internal brackets omitted).  As the government \nasserted at oral argument, however, even when the non-interference \nprovision was in effect, Plaintiffs were free to fire their insurers or \nTPAs as they wished.  Oral. Arg. Tr. at 46:15-48:1. \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 77 of 86\n77 \n \nreligious order” from an annual return filing requirement).  \nSecond,  they  contend  that  the  regulations  entail  excessive \nentanglement  between  the  government  and  religious \ninstitutions.  Specifically, to the extent that the regulations \nseek  to  be  more  nuanced  and  context  specific,  looking  at \nspecific attributes of each organization in an effort accurately \nto distinguish among them, Plaintiffs contend the government \nimpermissibly interferes with internal church governance.         \nThe regulations draw a long-recognized and permissible \ndistinction  between  houses  of  worship  and  religious \nnonprofits.    The  Seventh  Circuit,  in  rejecting  a  similar \nchallenge  to  the  contraceptive  coverage  regulations,  noted \nthat “religious employers, defined as in the cited regulation, \nhave long enjoyed advantages (notably tax advantages) over \nother  entities,  without  these  advantages  being  thought  to \nviolate the establishment clause.”  Notre Dame, 743 F.3d at \n560  (internal  citation  omitted).    The  churches  gained  the \ncategorical exemption on the assumption that the relatively \nsmall numbers of employees who are employed by a church \nwill,  if  their  church’s  mission  opposes  contraception,  be \nministers or clerics likely to share that view, or at least have \nknowingly  joined  a  pervasively  sectarian  institution  that \nexpects them to.  77 Fed. Reg. at 8,728.  The categorical \nexemption was not extended to the broader group of religious \nnonprofits, however, because religiously affiliated hospitals, \nuniversities and social service agencies employ a wide range \nof  people  of  diverse  faiths  and  are  thus  “more  likely  to \nemploy individuals who have no religious objection to the use \nof contraceptive services and therefore are more likely to use \ncontraceptives.”  Id.  Limiting the exemption, but making the \nopt  out  available,  limits  the  burdens  that  flow  from \norganizations “subject[ing] their employees to the religious \nviews of the employer.”  Id.  \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 78 of 86\n78 \n \nPlaintiffs  equate  the  familiar  regulatory  distinction \nbetween  houses  of  worship  and  religiously  affiliated \norganizations,  based  on  organizational  form  and  purpose, \nwith  constitutionally  impermissible  distinctions  based  on \ndenomination.  They quote Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, \n231-32, 246 n.23 (1982) and Colorado Christian University v. \nWeaver, 534 F.3d 1245, 1259 (10th Cir. 2008), for the notion \nthat the Establishment Clause forbids distinguishing between \n“types  of  institutions”  as  surely  as  between  “sects  or \ndenominations.”  Pls.’ Br. 57-58 (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Both of the cases Plaintiffs rely on, however, were \nconcerned with lines drawn based on denomination, rather \nthan  organizational  form  or  purpose.29    In  Larson,  the \nSupreme Court invalidated a state law that imposed special \nregistration requirements on churches that received a majority \nof  their  donations  from  non-members  because  it  facially \ndiscriminated  against  religious  denominations  that  were \nnewer  or  chose  to  rely  on  public  solicitation  rather  than \nfinancial support from members.  456 U.S. at 246-48.  The \ndistinction  invalidated  in  Colorado  Christian  authorized \npublic  scholarships  for  students  at  Methodist  and  Roman \nCatholic  universities  while  refusing  them  to  students \nattending  non-denominational  evangelical  Protestant  or \nBuddhist universities.  See 534 F.3d at 1258.  The Colorado \nChristian court contrasted that denominational discrimination \nwith  the  permissible  exclusion  “of  all  devotional  theology \nmajors equally.”  Id. at 1256 (citing Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S. \n712, 715-16 (2004)).  This Court in University of Great Falls \nv. NLRB, 278 F.3d 1335, 1343 (D.C. Cir. 2002), similarly \n                                                 \n29 Indeed, the Plaintiffs’ argument would call into question the tax \nadvantages that have long been available to houses of worship, but \nnot other types of religious organizations.  Those tax advantages \nhave not been thought to violate the Establishment Clause.  See \nNotre Dame, 743 F.3d at 560. \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 79 of 86\n79 \n \ninvalidated a regulatory line that effectively asked whether \ncertain  schools  were  “sufficiently  religious”  to  be  exempt \nfrom  NLRB  jurisdiction,  administration  of  which  line  had \ndrawn the government into questioning whether the university \n“was legitimately ‘Catholic.’”  Id.  University of Great Falls \nfavors  a  test  relying  on  more  objective  factors  about  the \ninstitution’s structure and activities.  Id.  The regulations at \nissue here draw distinctions based on organizational form and \npurpose, and not religious belief or denomination, in keeping \nwith  Larson,  Colorado  Christian, and University of Great \nFalls.  See also Mich. Catholic Conf., 755 F.3d at 395; Notre \nDame, 743 F.3d at 560.   \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs assert that the regulations violate \nthe Establishment Clause because they believe they call on \nthe government impermissibly to “‘troll[] through a person’s \nor  institution’s  religious  beliefs.’”    Pls.’  Br.  60  (quoting \nMitchell  v.  Helms,  530  U.S.  793,  828  (2000)  (plurality \nopinion)). The regulations define a “religious employer” as \n“an organization that is organized and operates as a nonprofit \nentity and is referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of \nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.”  45 C.F.R. \n§ 147.131(a); see also 78 Fed. Reg. at 8,461 (stating that the \nexemption is restricted primarily to “churches, synagogues, \nmosques, and other houses of worship, and religious orders”).  \nThe IRS has developed a non-exhaustive, non-binding list of \nfourteen  factors  to  consider  when  determining  whether  an \nentity is in fact a religious employer.  See Am. Guidance \nFound.,  Inc.  v.  United  States,  490  F.  Supp.  304,  306  n.2 \n(D.D.C. 1980); Found. of Human Understanding v. United \nStates, 88 Fed. Cl. 203, 220 (2009).   \nPlaintiffs contend that, in order to determine whether an \nentity is in fact a religious employer, the government asks \nintrusive questions about its religious beliefs in violation of \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 80 of 86\n80 \n \nthe Establishment Clause.  They complain that the IRS factors \n“favor some types of religious groups over others” and that \n“they do so on the basis of intrusive judgments regarding \nbeliefs, practices, and organizational structures.”  Pls.’ Br. at \n61.  It is undisputed in this case that the Archdiocese is a \nreligious employer, and no other Plaintiff contends that it was \nimproperly denied religious-employer treatment.  As a result, \nPlaintiffs do not challenge a determination that has been made \nusing those factors, nor can they argue that the factors were \nimpermissibly applied to them.  Therefore, we agree with the \ndistrict  court  that  this  challenge  is  not  ripe  for  review.  \nRCAW, 2013 WL 6729515 at *43-44. \nE.  Internal Church Governance \nRelying  on  Hosanna-Tabor  Evangelical  Lutheran \nChurch & School v. EEOC, 132 S. Ct. 694 (2012), the RCAW \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  the  regulations  violate  the  Religion \nClauses of the First Amendment by impermissibly interfering \nwith matters of internal church governance.  They claim that \nthe  regulations  “artificially  split[]”  the  Catholic  Church  in \ntwo—into the Archdiocese (an exempt religious employer) \nand  its  related  nonprofit  organizations—and  prevent  the \nArchdiocese from “ensur[ing] that these organizations offer \nhealth plans consistent with Catholic beliefs.”  Pls.’ Br. at 63-\n64.    Neither  Hosanna-Tabor,  nor  any  other  precedent \ninterpreting  either  of  the  Constitution’s  Religion  Clauses, \nsupports this novel claim. \nThe  ACA’s  regulations  do  not  address  religious \ngovernance at all.   The regulations’ separate treatment of \nfunctions that Plaintiffs might prefer to group together does \nnot  interfere  with  how  the  Plaintiffs  govern  themselves \ninternally.  Plaintiffs  invoke  Hosanna-Tabor,  but  that  case \ndoes  not  stand  for  Plaintiffs’  proposition  that  the  First \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 81 of 86\n81 \n \nAmendment precludes application of a law simply because it \nmay affect different types of religious institution differently.   \nIn  Hosanna-Tabor,  the  Supreme  Court  recognized  a \n“ministerial exception, grounded in the First Amendment, that \nprecludes  application  of  [Title  VII  and  other  employment \ndiscrimination laws] to claims concerning the employment \nrelationship between a religious institution and its ministers.”  \n132 S. Ct. at 705 (internal quotation marks omitted); see id. at \n710.    The  Court  expressly  limited  its  holding  to  “an \nemployment  discrimination  suit  brought  on  behalf  of  a \nminister, challenging her church’s decision to fire her.”  Id.  \nThe  language  from  Hosanna-Tabor  that  plaintiffs  invoke, \nused there in the context of disapproving judicial review of \nministers’ discrimination claims because it would interfere \n“with an internal church decision that affects the faith and \nmission of the church itself,” id. at 707, does not apply here.  \nUnlike in that case, nothing about the regulation challenged \nhere would “depriv[e] the church of control over the selection \nof those who [would] personify its beliefs”—the Church’s \nown  ministers.    Id.  at  706.    The  Court’s  reasoning  in \nHosanna-Tabor  does  not  extend  beyond  ecclesiastical \nemployment matters to regulations that may affect a church’s \ndecision about its health care plan.  Accordingly, the church-\ngovernance claim must fail.  \nF.  Equal Protection \nThe Priests for Life Plaintiffs argue that the regulations \nviolate  equal  protection  as  guaranteed  by  the  Fifth \nAmendment, by discriminating on the basis of religion and \nimpinging on their fundamental rights.  This claim is largely \nduplicative of Plaintiffs’ Establishment Clause challenge and \nfails for similar reasons.  The Priests for Life Plaintiffs cite no \ncase in support of their contention that alleged discrimination \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 82 of 86\n82 \n \nbetween  types  of  religious  organizations  within  a \ndenomination  gives  rise  to  an  equal  protection  claim.  \nAdditionally, as the district court observed, the Priests for \nLife Plaintiffs’ fundamental rights claim is identical to their \nother First Amendment claims.  Priests for Life, 7 F. Supp. 3d \nat 110.  Because we have rejected those claims, we apply \nrational basis scrutiny to the regulations.  See Locke v. Davey, \n540 U.S. 712, 720 n.3 (2004) (applying rational-basis scrutiny \nto an Equal Protection Clause claim alleging discrimination \nbased on religion where the plaintiffs’ Free Exercise Clause \nchallenge failed).  Because, as discussed supra Section IV.B, \nthe regulations survive strict scrutiny, they necessarily survive \nthis more limited form of review.   \nVI.  Administrative Procedure Act \nThe  RCAW  Plaintiffs  contend  that  the  government \nviolated  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act  by  erroneously \ninterpreting  the  exemption  to  apply  on  an  employer-by-\nemployer  basis,  rather  than  a  plan-by-plan  basis.    The \nregulations state that the HRSA “may establish an exemption \nfrom [the regulations] with respect to a group health plan \nestablished or maintained by a religious employer (and health \ninsurance  coverage  provided  in  connection  with  a  group \nhealth plan established or maintained by a religious employer) \nwith  respect  to  any  requirement  to  cover  contraceptive \nservices  under  such  guidelines.”    45  C.F.R.  §  147.131(a).  \nWith respect to “multiple employer plans”—plans established \nor maintained by an exempt religious employer as well as \nnon-exempt organizations—the Departments concluded that \n“the availability of the exemption or an accommodation [will] \nbe determined on an employer-by-employer basis.”  78 Fed. \nReg. at 39,886.  This means that “each employer [is] required \nto independently meet the definition of religious employer or \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 83 of 86\n83 \n \neligible organization in order to avail itself of the exemption \nor an accommodation.”  Id.  \nAn  agency’s  interpretation  of  its  own  regulation  is \nentitled to substantial deference.  Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. \n452, 461 (1997).  The RCAW Plaintiffs contend that such \ndeference is not appropriate here, however, for two reasons.  \nFirst,  they  argue  that,  contrary  to  the  government’s \ncontention,  the  regulation  unambiguously  states  that  the \nexemption applies on a plan-by-plan basis.  See Christensen \nv. Harris Cnty., 529 U.S. 576, 588 (2000) (“Auer deference is \nwarranted  only  when  the  language  of  the  regulation  is \nambiguous.”).    The  regulation,  however,  is  silent  as  to \nwhether  the  exemption  will  apply  on  an  employer-by-\nemployer basis or a plan-by-plan basis.  It uses the phrase \n“group  health  plan,”  because  the  contraceptive-coverage \nrequirement  applies  to  group  health  plans  (as  opposed  to \nemployers), not because the regulatory unit for purposes of \nthe exemption is the plan rather than the employer.  Because \nthe  regulation  does  not  speak  to  that  issue,  we  reject  the \nRCAW Plaintiffs’ claim that the Departments’ interpretation is \nnot entitled to deference.    \nSecond, the RCAW Plaintiffs assert that deference to the \nDepartments’  interpretation  is  not  warranted  because  it \nconflicts  with  a  prior  interpretation  put  forth  by  the \ngovernment.  See Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., \n132  S.  Ct.  2156,  2166  (2012)  (“[D]eference  is  likewise \nunwarranted when there is reason to suspect that the agency’s \ninterpretation  ‘does  not  reflect  the  agency’s  fair  and \nconsidered judgment on the matter in question.’  This might \noccur when the agency’s interpretation conflicts with a prior \ninterpretation . . . .” (internal citations omitted)).  But the \nDepartments have not changed their position.  When they \nissued  the  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  regarding \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 84 of 86\n84 \n \n“Coverage  of  Certain  Preventive  Services  Under  the \nAffordable Care Act,” the Departments made clear that they \nintended the exemption to apply on an employer-by-employer \nbasis.  See 78 Fed. Reg. at 8,467.  (“The Departments propose \nto  make  the  accommodation  or  the  religious  employer \nexemption available on an employer-by-employer basis.  That \nis,  each  employer  would  have  to  independently  meet  the \ndefinition of eligible organization or religious employer in \norder to take advantage of the accommodation or the religious \nemployer exemption with respect to its employees and their \ncovered dependents.”).  The language on which the RCAW \nPlaintiffs  rely  to  demonstrate  that  the  Departments  have \nchanged their position does not support their argument.  See \n77 Fed. Reg. 16,501, 16,502 (Mar. 21, 2012).  All they point \nto is a hypothetical that specifies that an exempt religious \nschool  is  categorically  exempt  from  the  contraceptive \ncoverage requirement, whether it establishes and maintains its \nown plan or offers its employees coverage through a plan \nestablished by the exempt religious diocese with which it is \naffiliated.  See id.  Thus, contrary to the RCAW Plaintiffs’ \ncontention,  the  Departments’  interpretation  that  the \nexemption applies on an employer-by-employer basis does \nnot conflict with its earlier interpretation of the regulation, \nand is entitled to Auer deference.   \nFinally,  in  their  supplemental  brief,  Plaintiffs  contend \nthat  the  government  lacked  the  “good  cause”  required  to \npromulgate  the  interim  final  rule  without  notice  and \ncomment.  See  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3)(B)  (authorizing \npromulgation  of  interim  final  rules  without  notice  and \ncomment when the agency finds on the record “that notice \nand public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, \nor contrary to the public interest.”).  Several reasons support \nHHS’s decision not to engage in notice and comment here.  \nFirst, the agency made a good cause finding in the rule it \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 85 of 86\n85 \n \nissued.    See  79  Fed.  Reg.  at  51,095-96.    Second,  the \nregulations  the  interim  final  rule  modifies  were  recently \nenacted  pursuant  to  notice  and  comment  rulemaking,  and \npresented  virtually  identical  issues;  moreover,  HHS  will \nexpose  its  interim  rule  to  notice  and  comment  before  its \npermanent  implementation.    See  5  U.S.C.  §  553(b)(3)(B) \n(good cause exists when “notice and public procedure . . . are \n. . . unnecessary”).  Third, the modifications made in the \ninterim final regulations are minor, meant only to “augment \ncurrent regulations in light of the Supreme Court’s interim \norder in connection with an application for an injunction in \nWheaton College.”  79 Fed. Reg. at 51,092; see also Tenn. \nGas Pipeline Co. v. FERC, 969 F.2d 1141, 1144 (D.C. Cir. \n1992) (“We have . . . indicated that the less expansive the \ninterim rule, the less the need for public comment.”).  The \ngovernment reasonably interpreted the Supreme Court’s order \nin Wheaton College as obligating it to take action to further \nalleviate  any  burden  on  the  religious  liberty  of  objecting \nreligious organizations.  See 79 Fed. Reg. at 51,095-96; see \nalso Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emp., AFL-CIO v. Block, 655 F.2d \n1153, 1155-57 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (validating promulgation of \ninterim rule without notice and comment because, inter alia, \nit  would  comply  with  a  court  order).    As  the  agency \nexplained, delay in implementation of the rule would interfere \nwith the prompt availability of contraceptive coverage and \ndelay  the  implementation  of  the  alternative  opt-out  for \nreligious objectors.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3)(B) (good cause \nexists when “notice and public procedure . . . are . . . contrary \nto the public interest”). \n*  *  * \nIn  sum,  we  reject  all  of  Plaintiffs’  challenges  to  the \nregulations.    Accordingly,  we  affirm  the  district  court’s \nopinion in Priests for Life in its entirety.  As to the RCAW \n\nUSCA Case #13-5368      Document #1522271            Filed: 11/14/2014      Page 86 of 86\n86 \n \ndecision,  we  vacate  the  district  court’s  grant  of  summary \njudgment  for  Thomas  Aquinas  and  its  holding  as  to  the \nunconstitutionality  of  the  non-interference  provision,  and \naffirm the remainder of the decision. \nSo ordered.

S. ____ (2016)  3 \n \nPer Curiam \n PER CURIAM. \n  Petitioners  are  primarily  nonprofit  organizations  that\nprovide  health  insurance  to  their  employees.    Federal  \nregulations require petitioners to cover certain contracep-\ntives  as  part  of  their  health  plans,  unless  petitioners \nsubmit a form either to their insurer or to the Federal  \nGovernment, stating that they object on religious grounds \nto  providing  contraceptive  coverage.    Petitioners  allege \nthat  submitting  this  notice  substantially  burdens  the \nexercise  of  their  religion,  in  violation  of  the  Religious \nFreedom  Restoration  Act  of  1993,  107  Stat.  1488,  42  \nU. S. C. §2000bb et seq. \n  Following oral argument, the Court requested supple-\nmental  briefing  from  the  parties  addressing  “whether \ncontraceptive  coverage  could  be  provided  to  petitioners’ \nemployees,  through  petitioners’  insurance  companies,\nwithout any such notice from petitioners.”  Post,  p. ___.  \nBoth petitioners and the Government now confirm that \nsuch an option is feasible.  Petitioners have clarified that \ntheir religious exercise is not infringed where they “need \nto do nothing more than contract for a plan that does not \ninclude coverage for some or all forms of contraception,” \neven  if  their  employees  receive  cost-free  contraceptive \ncoverage  from  the  same  insurance  company.    Supple-\nmental Brief for Petitioners 4.  The Government has con-\nfirmed that the challenged procedures “for employers with \ninsured plans could be modified to operate in the manner\nposited in the Court’s order while still ensuring that the \naffected women receive contraceptive coverage seamlessly, \ntogether with the rest of their health coverage.”  Supple-\nmental Brief for Respondents 14–15.\n  In light of the positions asserted by the parties in their \nsupplemental  briefs,  the  Court  vacates  the  judgments \nbelow and remands to the respective United States Courts\nof Appeals for the Third, Fifth, Tenth, and D. C. Circuits.  \nGiven the gravity of the dispute and the substantial clari-\n\n4  ZUBIK v. BURWELL  \n   \nPer Curiam  \nfication and refinement in the positions of the parties, the \nparties on remand should be afforded an opportunity  to \narrive at an approach going forward that accommodates \npetitioners’  religious  exercise  while  at  the  same  time\nensuring that women covered by petitioners’ health plans \n“receive full and equal health coverage, including contra-\nceptive coverage.”  Id., at 1.  We anticipate that the Courts \nof Appeals will allow the parties sufficient time to resolve \nany outstanding issues between them. \n  The Court finds the foregoing approach more suitable \nthan  addressing  the  significantly  clarified  views  of  the \nparties in the first instance.  Although there may still be\nareas of disagreement between the parties on issues of \nimplementation, the importance of those areas of potential \nconcern is uncertain, as is the necessity of this Court’s \ninvolvement at this point to resolve them.  This Court has  \ntaken similar action in other cases in the past.  See, e.g., \nMadison County v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 562  \nU. S. 42, 43  (2011) (per curiam) (vacating and remanding \nfor the Second Circuit to “address, in the first instance,  \nwhether  to  revisit  its  ruling  on  sovereign  immunity  in \nlight of [a] new factual development, and—if necessary—\nproceed to address other questions in the case consistent \nwith its sovereign immunity ruling”); Kiyemba v. Obama, \n559 U. S. 131, 132 (2010) (per curiam) (vacating and re-\nmanding for the D. C. Circuit to “determine, in the first \ninstance, what further proceedings in that court or in the \nDistrict Court are necessary and appropriate for the full \nand  prompt  disposition  of  the  case  in  light  of  the  new \ndevelopments”); Villarreal v. United States, 572 U. S. ___ \n(2014) (vacating and remanding to the Fifth Circuit “for\nfurther consideration in light of the position asserted by \nthe Solicitor General in his brief for the United States”). \n  The Court expresses no view on the merits of the cases.  \nIn particular, the Court does not decide whether petition-\ners’  religious  exercise  has  been  substantially  burdened,  \n\n  Cite as:  578 U. S. ____ (2016)  5 \n \nPer Curiam  \nwhether  the  Government  has  a  compelling  interest,  or \nwhether the current regulations are the least restrictive \nmeans of serving that interest. \n  Nothing in this opinion, or in the opinions or orders of \nthe courts below, is to affect the ability of the Government \nto ensure that women covered by petitioners’ health plans \n“obtain,  without  cost,  the  full  range  of  FDA  approved\ncontraceptives.”    Wheaton  College   v.  Burwell,  573  U. S. \n___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 1).  Through this litigation, \npetitioners  have  made  the  Government  aware  of  their\nview that they meet “the requirements for exemption from \nthe  contraceptive  coverage  requirement  on  religious\ngrounds.”  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2).  Nothing in this opin-\nion, or in the opinions or orders of the courts below, “pre-\ncludes the Government from relying on this notice, to the \nextent it considers it necessary, to facilitate the provision \nof full contraceptive coverage” going forward.   Ibid.  Be-\ncause the Government may rely on this notice, the Gov-\nernment may not impose taxes or penalties on petitioners\nfor failure to provide the relevant notice.\n  The judgments of the Courts of Appeals are vacated, and \nthe cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent \nwith this opinion.  \nIt is so ordered.  \n\n  Cite as:  578 U.

S. ____ (2016)  3 \n \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., concurring  \ners’ religious exercise has been substantially burdened,” or \n“whether the current regulations are the least restrictive \nmeans  of  serving”  a  compelling  governmental  interest.  \nAnte, at 4–5.  Lower courts, therefore, should not construe \neither today’s per curiam or our order of March 29, 2016, \nas signals of where this Court stands.  We have included \nsimilarly explicit disclaimers in previous orders.  See, e.g., \nWheaton College v. Burwell, 573 U. S. ___ (2014) (“[T]his \norder  should  not  be  construed  as  an  expression  of  the \nCourt’s views on the merits”).  Yet some lower courts have \nignored  those  instructions.  See,  e.g.,   Sharpe  Holdings,  \nInc., v. Department of Health and Human Servs., 801 F. 3d \n927, 944 (CA8 2015) (“[I]n Wheaton College, Little Sisters \nof the Poor, and Zubik,  the Supreme Court approved a \nmethod of notice to HHS that is arguably less onerous \nthan [existing regulations] yet permits the government to \nfurther its interests.  Although the Court’s orders were not \nfinal rulings on the merits, they at the very least collec-\ntively constitute a signal that less restrictive means exist \nby which the government may further its interests”).  On \nremand in these cases, the Courts of Appeals should not\nmake the same mistake. \n  I  also  join  the  Court’s  opinion  because  it  allows  the \nlower courts to consider only whether existing or modified \nregulations could provide seamless contraceptive coverage \n“‘to petitioners’ employees, through petitioners’ insurance \n \ncompanies,  without  any . . .  notice  from  petitioners.’”  \n \nAnte, at 3.  The opinion does not, by contrast, endorse the \npetitioners’ position that the existing regulations substan-\ntially burden their religious exercise or that contraceptive \ncoverage  must  be  provided  through  a  “separate  policy, \nwith  a  separate  enrollment  process.”    Supp.  Brief  for \nPetitioners 1; Supp. Reply Brief for Petitioners 5.  Such  \nseparate contraceptive-only policies do not currently exist, \nand the Government has laid out a number of legal and \npractical obstacles to their creation.  See Supp. Reply Brief \n \n\n4  ZUBIK v. BURWELL  \n   \nSOTOMAYOR,  J., concurring  \nfor Respondents 3–4.  Requiring standalone contraceptive-\nonly coverage would leave in limbo all of the women now \nguaranteed seamless preventive-care coverage under the \nAffordable Care Act.  And requiring that women affirma-\ntively opt into such coverage would “impose precisely the \nkind of barrier to the delivery of preventive services that \nCongress sought to eliminate.”  Id., at 6. \n  Today’s opinion does only what it says it does: “afford[s] \nan opportunity” for the parties and Courts of Appeals to \nreconsider the parties’ arguments in light of petitioners’ \nnew articulation of their religious objection and the Gov-\nernment’s clarification about what the existing regulations \naccomplish, how they might be amended, and what such \nan amendment would sacrifice.  Ante, at 4.  As enlightened \nby the parties’ new submissions, the Courts of Appeals \nremain free to reach the same conclusion or a different one  \non each of the questions presented by these cases.  \n ",
