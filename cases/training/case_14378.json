    "summary": "<p>This is the second case filed in the <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=33\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Signal International cases</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On Apr. 20, 2011, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed suit against defendant Signal International, LLC, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. The EEOC alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC's allegations of unlawful employment practices and a hostile workplace on the basis of national origin, immigration status, and race stem from a related case, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14377\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>David v. Signal International</em></a>, brought against Signal by the guestworkers themselves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The EEOC alleged that the terms and conditions of the Indian guestworkers' employment were less favorable than their non-Indian counterparts', and that Signal engaged in a pattern or practice of subjecting the Indian workers to a hostile environment and disparate terms and conditions of employment based on their race and national origin. The EEOC sought injunctive relief and monetary awards, including damages for emotional pain and suffering, punitive damages for malicious and reckless conduct, and attorneys' fees.</p>\r\n<p>On Jan. 24, 2012, the Court (Magistrate Judge Robert Walker) granted a motion to intervene by three private plaintiffs who had been subjected to the allegedly unlawful treatment. The plaintiffs then filed a class action complaint, defining the proposed class as \"all Indian Workers who paid recruitment fees and/or other amounts to the Recruiters, and who were employed by Signal at any time in 2006, 2007, and/or 2008.\" 2012 WL 208864.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On Feb. 29, 2012, the Court (Chief U.S. District Judge Louis Guirola) granted Signal's motion to transfer the case to the Eastern District of Louisiana on the grounds that this case and <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14377\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>David</em></a> arose from the same conduct, and that the substantive issues and the parties were similar. District Judge Jay Zainey of the Eastern District of Louisiana then denied Signal's motion to consolidate the cases, noting that since the EEOC was a party to this case, it was statutorily entitled to expedited consideration.</p>\r\n<p>On Sept. 10, 2013, Magistrate Judge Daniel Knowles granted the EEOC's motion for a protective order for information related to the immigration history or status of individuals involved in the case. Signal argued it needed the information for impeachment purposes; the court noted that it had <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-LA-0010-0007.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">already rejected this argument</a> in the <em>David</em> case, and once again barred discovery on the matter. 2013 WL 4854136.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On Sept. 26, 2013, the Court dismissed the Intervenors' (guestworkers') claim for recovery of recruitment fees. The alleged discriminatory conduct in connection with the recruitment related only to events that occurred outside of the United States and before the Intervenors began to work at Signal's facilities, and the court found that Congress intended to exclude non-citizens located outside the United States from the protection of Title VII. As such, the Intervenors were not covered when they paid the recruitment fee because they were non-citizens and were not working within the United States at the time.</p>\r\n<p>On July 12, 2014, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation denied Signal's motion to transfer all of the cases pending against it to the Eastern District of Louisiana.</p>\r\n<p>On Oct. 14, 2014, the Court denied Signal's motion for interlocutory appeal of the Court's prohibition of discovery on plaintiffs' post-Signal information including immigration status. 37 F.Supp.3d 37.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Although the Court set a trial date of June 1, 2015, on May 7, 2015, the trial was delayed indefinitely until an appeal on a separate EEOC case, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=10911\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>EEOC v. Bass Pro Outdoor World, LLC</em></a>, could be resolved. Shortly after, on July 12, 2015, Signal filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy, putting a further halt on the case proceedings.</p>\r\n<p>In Dec. 2015, the EEOC announced that the parties had reached a <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/12-18-15.cfm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">settlement</a> for all cases, approved by the bankruptcy court. Signal would pay $5 million to 476 guestworkers through a claims process. All aggrieved individuals included in the litigation could receive relief in spite of the bankruptcy proceedings. Signal's CEO also issued an apology for its conduct.</p>\r\n<p>This case is now closed.</p>",

Signal International, LLC et al (Civil\nAction No. 08-1220) (โDavidโ)\nORDER AND REASONS\nBefore the Court is defendant Signal International, LLCโs (โSignalโ) motion to sever.1\nPlaintiffs oppose Signalโs motion.2  Signal has filed a reply in further support of its motion.3\nFor the reasons set forth below, Signalโs motion to sever is denied.\nBACKGROUND\nOn January 4, 2012, while this case was pending in Section โAโ of this Court, Judge\nZainey denied plaintiffsโ motion to certify this case as a class action under Rule 23 of the\n1 R. Doc. 1196.\n2 R. Doc. 1203.\n3 R. Doc. 1207.\n1\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Docum   ent 202   Filed 06/11/13   Page 2 of 5\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.4  Signal now moves for severance of the twelve named\nplaintiffsโ claims under Rules 20, as it claims the plaintiffs are misjoined under Rule 21. \nHowever, as Signal recognizes in its motion to sever, after denying class certification, Judge\nZainey determined that this matter will continue to move forward with all twelve plaintiffs,\nbeginning with a trial involving five of the twelve named plaintiffs.5  This Court adopted\nJudge Zaineyโs plan at a June 15, 2012 status conference.6\nANALYSIS\nThere are three interrelated rules of civil procedure at play in Signalโs motion.  Rule\n20 provides, in pertinent part, that:\nPersons may join in one action as plaintiffs if:\n(A)  they assert any right to relief jointly, severally, or\nin the alternative with respect to or arising out of\nthe same transaction, occurrence, or series of\ntransactions or occurrences; and\n(B)  any  question  of  law  or  fact  common  to all\nplaintiffs will arise in the action.\nFED. R. CIV. P. 20(a).  Rule 21 provides that โ[m]isjoinder of parties is not a ground for\ndismissing an action,โ but that โ[o]n motion or on its own, the court may at any time, on\n4 R. Doc. 1117.\n5See Civil Action No. 12-557, R. Doc. 78.  Judge Zainey issued this Order, which is dated March 16,\n2012, after reviewing proposed case management orders submitted by the parties in this case and in Civil\nAction No. 12-557. SeeCivil Action No. 08-1220, R. Doc. 1147 (order instructing parties to file proposed\ncase management orders after denial of class certification).  It is not clear why this Order was not docketed\nin both cases, as it clearly applies to both.  In addition, while a formal motion to sever was not in front of\nJudge Zainey at the time he issued the March 16, 2012 Order, Signal had raised the issue of severance in\nits proposed case management order, so Judge Zainey engaged in a detailed analysis of the costs and\nbenefits of severance of the plaintiffsโ claims and determined that proceeding with five named plaintiffs\nwas the best solution, unless the parties could agree otherwise.  The parties never agreed on a different\nsolution, so Judge Zaineyโs plan stands.\n6 R. Doc. 1178.\n2\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Docum   ent 202   Filed 06/11/13   Page 3 of 5\njust terms, add or drop a party. The court may also sever any claim against a party.โ  FED.\nR.CIV.P. 21.  Rule 42(b) provides that โ[f]or convenience, to avoid prejudice, or to expedite\nand economize, the court may order a separate trial of one or more separate issues, claims,\ncrossclaims, counterclaims, or third-party claims.โ  FED.R.CIV.P. 42(b).\nSignal is correct in stating that, after class certification is denied, the district court\nis required to evaluate the case to determine if the named plaintiffsโ claims are properly\njoined under Rule 20.  See, e.g., Acevedo v. Allsupโs Convenience Stores, Inc., 600 F.3d 516,\n521 (5th Cir. 2010).  The decision whether to allow permissive joinder under Rule 20 or to\norder severance of misjoined plaintiffs under Rules 21 and 42(b) is left to the discretion of\nthe trial court. See Williams v. Hoyt, 556 F.2d 1336, 1341 (5th Cir. 1977) (the district court\nhas โbroad discretionโ in determining the propriety of permissive joinder of parties under\nRule 20); see also Applewhite v. Reichhold Chemicals, Inc., 67 F.3d 571, 574 (5th Cir. 1995).\nIn Applewhite, the Fifth Circuit explained the interplay of Rules 20, 21, and 42, in the\ncontext of a case in which class certification was denied, leaving a number of named\nplaintiffs asserting similar claims against one defendant:\nGenerally, permissive joinder of plaintiffs under Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 20 is at the option of the plaintiffs, assuming\nthey meet the requirements set forth in Rule 20. Under Rules\n20 and 21, the district court has the discretion to sever an\naction if it is misjoined or might otherwise cause delay or\nprejudice.  Further, the district court also has discretion to\nsever claims under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42(b), in\nfurtherance  of  convenience  or  economy,  or  to  prevent\nprejudice.  This discretion, however, should be exercised after\nan examination of the individual case. \nId. (internal citations omitted).  As evidenced by this passage, the Courtโs discretion in\nmanaging a case after the denial of class certification is very broad.\n3\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Docum   ent 202   Filed 06/11/13   Page 4 of 5\nDespite Signalโs protestations to the contrary, Judge Zaineyโs finding that plaintiffsโ\nclaims are unsuitable for class certification under Rule 23 is not tantamount to a finding\nthat only severance of all claims will afford the parties a fair and just trial of plaintiffsโ\nclaims against Signal.  As the district court in Fisher v. Ciba Specialty Chems. Corp., 245\nF.R.D. 539 (S.D. Ala. 2007) explained, in another case involving a severance issue after the\ndenial of class certification:\nThe Rule 20 inquiry is distinct from that under Rule 23, and a\nruling against the plaintiffs on the latter in no way suggests\n(much  less  mandates)  a  like  outcome  with  respect  to  the\nformer.  Stated  differently,  there  is  no  predomination\nprerequisite for joinder of multiple plaintiffs' claims, and Rule\n20 contemplates a much lower threshold for allowing plaintiffs'\nclaims to proceed to trial together than is required by Rule 23\nfor  class  certification.  The  touchstone  of  the  Rule  20\njoinder/severance analysis is whether the interests of efficiency\nand judicial economy would be advanced by allowing the\nclaims to travel together, and whether any party would be\nprejudiced if they did.\nId. at 542.  Again, Rule 20 creates a two-prong test, โallowing joinder of plaintiffs when (1)\ntheir claims arise out of the โsame transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or\noccurrencesโ and when (2) there is at least one common question of law or fact linking all\nclaims.โ  Acevedo, 600 F.3d at 521 (citations omitted).  Signalโs severance argument takes\nfar too strict an approach to this liberal two-prong test, which the Court finds is clearly met\nin this case.  The first prong is met because  plaintiffsโ claims all arise out of the same\nallegedly discriminatory practices and policies, and all the plaintiffs claim to have suffered\ndamage as a result of similar, if not identical, alleged misrepresentations and fraudulent\nschemes orchestrated by Signal.  In addition, plaintiffsโ claims share several common\nquestions of both law and fact, and thus the second prong of the Rule 20 test - which\n4\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Docum   ent 202   Filed 06/11/13   Page 5 of 5\nrequires only one such common question - is easily met. Acevedo, 600 F.3d at 521.\n   Not only is the Rule 20 test met in this case, such that permissive joinder of\nplaintiffs under Rule 20 is appropriate, the Court also finds that severance under Rule 21\nor 42(b) is likely to have the opposite effect from what Signal claims to seek, causing the\nindividual plaintiffsโ cases against Signal to become hopelessly mired in inefficiency,\nredundance, and delay.  The Court further finds that severance would surely result in\nprejudice to the plaintiffs, while the risk of prejudice to Signal if severance is denied is\nminimal.\nSignalโs motion to sever, which is essentially a motion to reconsider Judge Zainey's\nand the Court's decision regarding severance in this case, fails to provide any compelling\nreason for the Court to revisit the issue.  Both Judge Zainey and this Court have already\nevaluated this case and determined that it will proceed under one case number with twelve\nnamed plaintiffs, and that the first trial in this matter will have five named plaintiffs; three\nchosen by plaintiffs and two chosen by defendants.  The Court, in its discretion, denies\nSignalโs motion to sever.\nAccordingly, IT IS ORDERED that Signalโs motion to sever be and hereby is\nDENIED.\n11th\nNew Orleans, Louisiana, this ___ day of June, 2013.\n_____________________________\n   SUSIE MORGAN\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\nCourt to Notify:\nMagistrate Judge Daniel E.

SECTION \"E\" (3)\nORDER\nOn July 31, 2013, the EEOC's Motion for Protective Order [Doc. #207] and the Motion of\nDefendant Signal International, L.L.C. for Protective Order [Doc. #208] came on for oral hearing\nbefore the undersigned.  Present were Gerald Miller and Julie Bean on behalf of plaintiff EEOC,\nDaniel Werner and Thomas Fritzsche on behalf of plaintiffs-intervenors, and Erin Hangartner and\nHal Ungar on behalf of defendant Signal Internationla, L.L.C.  After the oral hearing, the Court took\nthe motion under advisement.  Having reviewed the motion, the opposition and the case law, the\nCourt rules as follow.\nI. Background\nThis is a companion case toD  avid v. Signal International, L.L.C,. and this Court has repeated\nthe factual background on numerous occasions and will not do so again.  See David v. Signal Int'l,\nL.L.C., Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 WL 4344540 (E.D. La. Sept. 21, 2012).\n\nII. The EEOC's Motion for Protective Order [Doc. #207]\nA. The EEOC's Contentions\nThe EEOC f irst asks the Court to grant its m otion to protect inf ormation that has an\ninherently in terrorem effect.  It asks the Court to pr ohibit defendants from inquiring into any\nindividual's immigration history or status.  Citing case law, it notes that courts have held that social\nsecurity numbers (\"SSNs\"), employment histories, places of birth, places of residence, post-Signal\nemployment history and income, information about family members and tax documents have an in\nterrorem effect.  It does not disput e that def endants are entitled to any alias used during an\nindividual's employment with them.  \nThe EEOC argues that the im migration status of any individual ha s no bearing on his\nentitlement to protection under Title VII and Section1 981.  It contends that even were the Court to\nfind the information relevant, that relevance is ouwt eighed by the risk of injury and prejudice to any\nindividual.  It maintains that the production ofs uch information will chill or outright preclude some\nof the individuals' claims.  The EEOC argues thatc ourts have recognized that the production of such\ninformation may even preclude other workers from  maintaining their claims, thus limiting the\nenforcement of the federal civil rights statutes.  It contends that it must be able to ensure all of the\nindividuals' involvem ent in this lawsuit, thei r availability for discovery and trial a nd t heir\nwillingness to communicate with the government as witnesses and victims.  \nThe EEOC also notes that there is a widely-recognized policy against the disclosure of tax\nreturns.  It maintains that forcing such disclosure threatens the effective administration of our tax\nlaws given the self-reporting of income and would deter future plaintiffs from coming forward.  The\nEEOC contends that this reasoning applies to any document that would reveal income received or\n2\n\nsources of incom e (other than  that received fr om Signal).   It maintains that Signal can not\ndemonstrate the relevance of such documents.  The EEOC argues that courts have routinely held that\nany relevance of a civil rights plaintifsf 'employment history is outweighed by the risk of harm posed\nto the plaintiff.  \nThe EEOC notes that the rest of the protectiveo rder sets out the procedure for all parties to\nfollow in handling documents that a party deems to be confidential.  \nB. Signal's Opposition\nSignal notes that this Court earlier denied it access to T-visa applications and other\nimmigration-related documents in the related David lawsuit.  Signal also notes that when it did so,\nthe Court stated that the parties were concentrated on class-certification discovery, and that Signal\nmay be able to establish such information's admissibility at trial during a later phase.  In the order\ndenying class certification, the District Court noted  that it did not bel ieve that the immigration\nevidence would remain collateral for purposes of trial.  Signal notes that the District Court noted that\nplaintiffs were complicit with Signal when entering the country.  This, Signal contends, alters the\nbalance in its favor.\nNoting that this Court earlier relied on a decision fro mthe Ninth Circuit, Signal contends that\nthe Fifth Circuit has never examined nor adopted that decision. S ee Rivera v. NIBCO, Inc,. 364 F.3d\n1057 (9th Cir. 2004).  Signal doubts that the Fifth Cricuit would adopt the Ninth Circuits' sweeping\nstatement that never in an employment lawsuit will this information be relevant.  \nSignal maintains that it sim ply seeks to en force its constitutional right under the Fif th\nAmendment to impeach its antagonists with powerful evidence that is probative of bias or lack of\ncredibility.  Signal contends that the evidence is squarely rooted in the litigation's origins.  As the\n3\n\nDistrict Court recognized, plaintiffs knew that green cards were difficult to obtain, and they could\nonly obtain them from the United States government.  The District Court also recognized that some\nof the plaintiffs were willing to misrepresent to obtain entry to the United States.  An example of\nsuch misrepresentation, Signal argues, would be to devise a story of trafficking to remain here with\ntheir families.  The District Court also noted  that given the plaintif fs' own complicity in doing\nwhatever was necessary to enter this country, Signal (and others) m ay be able to prove that the\ninjuries alleged were not proxim ately caused by defendants'  conduct.  The District Cour t also\npointed out that at least one plaintiff had worked in this country before under the H-2B visa and\nwould have understood the temporary nature of such a visa.\nSignal maintains that it and the EEOC m ust work together to craf t a plan to utilize the\ninformation with as little collateral damage as possible.  It argues that it is unreservedly willing to\nminimize this Court's and the EEOC's concerns.   \nSignal contends that it has a right to full, probing and effective cross-examination of every\nmember of the class as to m otive.  It maintains that the EEOC potentially intends to present as\nwitnesses at trial the approximately 500 class members here, and it has the right to cross-examine\nthem to determine whether they invented the appalling conditions to bolstert heir trafficking claims. \nSignal consents to the majority of the remaining protective order, but notes that it does not\nconsent to the following:  \"Finally, as a federal governm ent agency, the EEOC has substantial\nobligations to disclose documents not prohibited from disclosure by law, or valid reason.\"  Signal\nnotes that the EEOC cites to the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") as authority but contends\nthat FOIA exempts federal courts from its provisions.   \n4\n\nIII. The Motion of Defendant Signal International, L.L.C. for Protective Order [Doc.  #208]\nA. Signal's Contentions\nWhile this memorandum is near identical to its opposition to the EEOC's motion, Signal\nnotes in the section on handling the confidential information that it seeks to avoid the abuse of the\ndiscovered material.  As an example, it points to plaintiffs' appearances on Dan Rather Reports to\nlambaste it.  Citing case law, Signal notes that teh United States Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit\nhave held that parties do not have a First Am endment right to dissemi nate, in advance of trial,\ninformation gained through the pre-trial discovery process.  Courts that have ruled similarly have\nheld that parties may only publish, disseminate or use the information when necessary to prepare\nfor or to try the case.  Signal also seeks to protect the privacy of non-parties in its subm itted\nproposed protective order. \nB. The EEOC's Opposition\nAfter detailing alleged examples of Signal's intransigence during the initial-discovery phase\nโ i.e., refusing to produce documents, refusing to produce documents in a certain format, refusing\nto meet with IT employees to discuss electronically-stored information (\"ESI\") โ the EEOC notes\nthat Signal is surreptitiously asking the Coutr to enter the protective orders rfom the David litigation,\nalbeit it without the in terrorem provisions.  The EEOC also notes  that Signal asks the Court to\nadopt the protective order [Doc. #1352] in which this Court declined to order Signal to re-produce\ndocuments in their native format.  The EEOC argues that it is not bound by  David, and because\nSignal surreptitiously asks the Court to adopt the order for that reason, the EEOC contends that\nSignal has waived the issue.  The EEOC argues that the two lawsuits are separate and distinct, have\nnot been consolidated, and it has been afforded no opportunity to be heard on the protective orders\n5\n\nin the David litigation.\nThe EEOC maintains that there is no case law to support the blanket adoption of protective\norders in another lawsuit. It argues that it has no idea to which documents each specific protective\norder refers, and while asking the Court to adopt all of theD  avid protective orders, Signal lists only\nthree (there were more).  The EEOC not es that under Rule 34, courts routinely order parties to\nproduce ESI in native format, with metadata attached.  \nThe EEOC contends that the District Court's class-certification decision in David is of no\nmoment as it was not a party and  is not bound by that adverse decision.  It notes that this Court\ndetermined that current immigration status is irrelevant because of its in terrorem effect, and the\nrelevancy, if any, did not outweigh the public interset in allowing employees to enforce their rights.\nIt maintains that this Court ha s already rejected Signal's argument that such evidence bears on\nmotive or bias or credibility.  \nNoting Signal's case law on which it now relies, the EEOC argues that such case law was\ndecided in 1972 and 1984, and it is thus not an intervening change in the law.  The EEOC also cites\nits own Supreme Court and lower court case law in which the courts note that trial courts possess\nwide latitude to impose restrictions on the cross-examination of a witness.  \nThe EEOC m aintains that Signal' s request ed provision barring the dissem ination of\ninformation is vague, overbroad and unworkable,  and that the provision does not appear to bar\nSignal from dissemination.  The EEOC contends that such a provision is unsupported by the law. \nSignal tried this once before, and the District Court denied it.  The EEOC argues that Signal ha s\nfailed to demonstrate good cause for such an order.  It maintains that Signal can not demonstrate\ngood cause because there has been no publicity in the last 18 months.  \n6\n\nWith regard to the addresses and telephonen umbers of former Signal employees, the EEOC\nhas no objection to the provision if it is modified to allow dissemination to persons deemed, in good\nfaith by counsel, necessary to the prosecution of the lawsuit.  \nIII. Intervenor's Combined Opposition to Si gnal's Motion for Protective Order and in\nSupport of the EEOC's Motion For Protective Order [Doc. #212]\nIntervenors note that Signal's arguments presuppose that the outcome and findings in this\nlawsuit or any other civil action bearo n the requirements for a T or U visa1.  They maintain that any\nindividual may apply for a T or U visa, and none oft he factors relates to participation or victory in\na civil action.  Intervenor s thus did not need to sue โ and thus did not need to contrive their\ndeplorable conditions โ to obtain a T or U visa.  \nIntervenors allege that Signal seeks to sim ply punish them โ certainly by inquiring into\ninformation regarding their wives and children.  Intervenors note that Signal has in the past made\nit clear that it would contact immigration officials and urge enforcement actions against them. \nIntervenors also contend that Signal's desire to impose a blanket ban on dissemination is\nunsupported by the law.  Distinguishing the case law on which Signal relies, Seattle Times Co. v.\nRhinehart, 467 U.S. 20 (1984), they note that there, the moving party sought to impose a ban on\nspecific dissemination related to their donors, not a blanket ban of all information produced during\ndiscovery.\nIntervenors argue that the blanket \"attorneys' eyes only\" designation as to home addresses\nand telephone numbers is overbroad, given that attorneys must sometimes discuss this information\nwith their staff, clients and expert witnesses. I ntervenors also object to the suggestion that counsel\n1\nThe intervenors here are โ generically โ the plaintiffs in the related David  lawsuit.\n7\n\nmust serve subpoenas on a non-party should it wish to speak to the non-party a nd use the home\naddress and telephone number with respect to serving such a subpoena.  Such a pr ovision would\ndelay litigation and increase expense.\nIV. Law and Analysis\nThe Federal Rules state that before a protectiev order may issue, the movant must show good\ncause why justice requires an order to protect a party or person from โannoyance, embarrassment,\noppression, or undue burden or expense.โ S ee Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(1).  To make a showing of good\ncause, the movant has the burden of showing the injury โwith specificity.โ  Pearson v. Miller, 211\nF.3d 57, 72 (3d Cir. 2000).  In other words, the party seeking the protective order must show good\ncause by demonstrating a particular need for protection.  See Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 785\nF.2d 1108, 1121 (3d Cir. 1986).  To establish good cause, a party seeking a protective order must\nset forth particular a nd specific demonstrations of fact, as distinguished from  stereotyped and\nconclusory statements.  Gulf Oil Co. v. Bernard, 452 U.S. 89, 102 n.16 (1981); In re Terra Intโl,\nInc., 134 F.3d 302, 306 (5th Cir. 1998).  Broad alle gations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not satisfy the Rule 26(c) test.   See Cipollone, 785 F.2d at\n1121 (citing United States v. Garrett , 571 F.2d 1323, 1326, n.3 (5th Cir. 1978)) (requi ring โa\nparticular and specific dem onstration of fact as  distinguished from stereotyped and conclusory\nstatementsโ);  Gen. Dynamics Corp. v. Selb Mfg. Corp., 481 F.2d 1204, 1212 (8th Cir. 1973);  8 C.\nWright, A. Miller & R. Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 2035 (Supp. 1985).  Moreover,\nthe alleged harm must be significant, not a mere trifle.  See Cipollone, 785 F.2d at 1121 (citing Joy\nv. North, 692 F.2d 880, 894 (2d Cir.1982)). \nThis Court finds the EEOC's argument persuasive with regard to the current immigration\n8\n\nstatus of intervenors. Even if intervenors'  current immigration status was relevant to the claim s\nasserted by the EEOC, discovery of such inform ation would have an in timidating effect on an\nemployee's willingness to assert his workplace rights and subject such an em ployee to potential\ndeportation.   See, e.g., Rivera v. NIBCO, Inc., 364 F.3d 1057, 1065 (9th Cir. 2004) (โ[W]ere we to\ndirect district courts to grant discovery request s for information related to immigration status in\nevery case involving national origin discrimination under Title VII, countless acts of illegal and\nreprehensible conduct would go unreported.โ); In re Reyes, 814 F.2d 168 (5th Cir. 1987) (granting\nmandamus and ordering district court to withdraw portion of discovery order allowing discovery of\nimmigrants' current immigration status).  The case law substantiates these fearsS. ee, e.g., Sure-Tan,\nInc. v. NLRB, 467 U.S. 883 (1984) (noting that employer reported five undocumented workers after\nthey voted in favor of union representation);D  oes I thru XXIII v. Advanced Textile Corp,. 214 F.3d\n1058, 1062-63 (9th Cir. 2000) (allowing  plaintiffs to plead their claims anonymously due to their\nfear of retaliatory deportation);  Fuentes v. INS, 765 F.2d 886, 887 (9th Cir. 1985) (noting that\nemployer reported undocumented workers he had employed for three years for less than minimum\nwage when they filed suit to recover wages owed) v,acated on other grounds by Fuentes v. IN,S 844\nF.2d 699 (9th Cir. 1988); Singh v. Jutla & C.D. & R's Oil, Inc., 214 F. Supp. 2d 1056, 1057 (N.D.\nCal. 2002) (noting that employer recruited undocumented worker and then reported him to the INS\nafter he filed an FLSA claim for unpaid wages); Contreras v. Corinthian Vigor Ins. Brokerage, Inc,.\n25 F. Supp. 2d 1053, 1055 (N.D. Cal. 1998) (noting that em ployer reported an undocum ented\nworker after she filed an FLSA claim for unpaid wages).\nThis is an action for unpaid wages and overtim e for work actually performed for Signal.\nCourts have recognized the in terrorem effect of inquiring into a party' s immigration status and\n9\n\nauthorization to work in this country when irrelevant to any m aterial claim because it presents a\nโdanger of intimidation [that] would inhibit plaintiffs in pursuing their rights.โ L iu v. Donna Karan\nInt'l, Inc., 207 F. Supp. 2d 191, 193 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (citations omitted).  Here, intervenors' current\nimmigration status is a collateral issue. The protective order becomes necessary as โ[i]t is entirely\nlikely t hat a ny undocum ented [litigant] forced  to produce docum ents related to his or her\nimmigration status will withdraw from the suit rather than produce such documents and face . . .\npotential deportation.โ  Topo v. Dhir , 210 F.R.D. 76, 78 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (quot ing Flores v.\nAlbertsons Inc., No. CV100515AHM, 2002 WL 1163623, *6 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 9, 2002)); see also\nEEOC v. First Wireless Group, Inc. , 225 F.R.D. 404 (E.D.N.Y. 2004) (holding that good cause\nshown for protective order where disclosure of im migration status would cause embarrassment,\npotential criminal charges, or deportation if status was discovered to be illegal).\nThe EEOC โ and intervenors โ have de monstrated good cause under Rule 26(c) for a\nprotective order to prohibit the disputed information. This Court has already held twice โ and been\nupheld once in holding โ that the disclosure of the information that Signal seeks would create ani n\nterrorem effect on interevenors. Courts frequently grant protective orders to protect an immigrant's\ncurrent immigration status. In Topo, for example, the court noted:\nPlaintiff asserts that by seeking information on her immigration status, defendants\nare attempting to exploit the discovery process in an attempt to threaten plaintiff's\ncontinued prose cution of her claim s. The court need not find such om inous\nundertones in defendant's discovery requests. Plaintiff's fears of her im migration\nstatus deterring further prosecution of her claim s are well-founded. Courts have\ngenerally recognized the in terrorem effect of inquiring into a party's immigration\nstatus when irrelevant to any m aterial claim. In particular, courts have noted that\nallowing parties to inquire about the immigration status of other parties, when not\nrelevant, would present a โdanger of intimidation [that] would inhibit plaintiffs in\npursuing their rights.โ Liu v. Donna Karan International, Inc., 207 F. Supp. 2d 191,\n193 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (citations omitted). Were plaintiff's immigration status relevant\nto prove a material aspect of the defense, a protective order would not be appropriate.\n10\n\nHowever, when the question of a partys' immigration status only goes to a collateral\nissue, as in this case, the protective ordebr ecomes necessary as โ[i]t is entirely likely\nthat any undocumented [litigant] forced to produce documents related to his or her\nimmigration status will withdraw from the suit rather than produce such documents\nand face ... potential deportation.โ Flores v. Albertsons Inc., 2002 WL 1163623, *5\n(C.D. Cal. 2002). Although the cases addressing this issue typically relate to the Fair\nLabor Standards Act, the underlying principle is still the same. When the potential\nfor abuse of procedure is high, the Court can and should act within its discretion to\nlimit the discovery process, even if  relevancy is determ ined. The court finds,\nhowever, for the reasons listed below that, atb est, plaintiff's immigration status is a\ncollateral issue not relevant to any material aspect of the case.\n210 F.R.D. 76, 78 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). Here, intervenors' immigration status is a collateral issue and\ndoes not go the m erits of Signal's defense.  This Court can not fathom  in what way any such\ninformation would be relevant to the issues in this suit.  Given that intervenors have invoked the\nFifth Amendment before, Signal will not be able to use evidence of prior crimes to impeach\nintervenors at trial.  In addition, the grounds for aindmissibility are irrelevant to any claim or defense\nhere.  The reasons why a particular intervenor may be refused admission to this country will not\nimpact any evidence submitted at trial. Further, any information on family members who are not\nparties to this lawsuit is clearly irrelevant.\nSignal asserts that information as to current immigration status would allow them to test\nintervenors' credibility. As the Court has noted before, credibility is always at issue. That, in and of\nitself, does not wa rrant an inquiry into the s ubject of current im migration status when such\nexamination would impose an undue burden on private enforcement of employment discrimination\nlaws.  See Rengifo v. Erevos Enters., Inc., No. 06 Civ. 4266, 2007 WL 894376 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 20,\n2007) (concluding that the opportunity to test th e credibility of a party based on representations\nmade when seeking employment does not outweigh the chilling effect that disclosure of immigration\nstatus has on employees seeking to enforce their rights); Avila-Blum v. Casa de Cambio Delgado,\n11\n\nInc., 236 F.R.D. 190, 192 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). โW hile documented workers face the possibility of\nretaliatory discharge for an assertion of theirl abor and civil rights, undocumented workers confront\nthe harsher reality that, in addition to possible discharge, their employer will likely report them to\nthe INS and they will be subjected to deporttaion proceedings or criminal prosecution.โ Rivera, 364\nF.3d at 1064. In  Rivera, the court observed that granting em ployers the right to inquire into\nimmigration status in  employment cases would allow them  to im plicitly raise threats of  such\nnegative consequences when a worker reports illegal practices.   Id. at 1065.  And while Signal\nmaintains that the Fifth Circuit would not adopt the reasoning underlying Rivera, this Court notes\nthat the Fifth Circuit has on one occasion issued a writ of mandamus โ an extraordinary remedy โ\nto order a district court to withdraw that porti on of its discovery order that allowed discovery of\nimmigrants' current immigration status.  Reyes, 814 F.2d at 170-71.  As it has before, this Court\nfinds that Signal's opportunity to test the cred ibility of plaintiffs doe s not outweigh the public\ninterest in allowing employees to enforce their rights.\nThat the parties are not in class-certification discovery proceedings is of no moment.  The\ncase law cited by this Court does not distinguish  between class-certification and m erits-based\ndiscovery to arrive at their conclusions.  Indeed,i n many of the cases, it is not readily apparent that\nthe plaintiffs sought class certification.  The Court finds that the underlying reasoning and analysis\nof those courts apply equally here at this stage of the litigation.  Accordingly, the Court grants the\nEEOC's motion with respect to this issue.  This holding includes the non-disclosure of intervenors'\ntax returns.  Galaviz-Zamora v. Brady Farms, Inc., 230 F.R.D 499, 503 (W.D. Mich. 2005). \nAs noted above, Signal also challenges the EEOC's inclusion of the following language in\nthe procedure to be followed with regard to c onfidential documents: \"Finally, as a federal\n12\n\ngovernment agency, the EEOC has substantial obligations to disclose documents not prohibited from\ndisclosure by law, or valid reason.\"  Signal citesV alenti v. U.S. Department of Justice, 503 F. Supp.\n230 (E.D. La 1980), as support for its argume nt that such language should be stricken from  the\nproposed protective order because the Freedom  of Information Act (\"FOIA\") does not apply to\ncourts of the United States.  The Court finds Valenti distinguishable.  \nThe FOIA requires that each agency of the government shall make available to the public\ninformation of a variety of kinds consisting mainly of agency records. 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(2)-(3). In\ndefining the term โagency,โ the Act itself specifically exempts โthe courts of the United Statesโ from\nthe definition.  Id. ยง 551(1)(B).  In Valenti, the question before the court was whether a witness\nbefore the grand jury was entitled to a transcript of his testimony before the grand jury under the\nFOIA.  See id. at 231-33.   The court, relying on Sectio5n5 1(1)(B), ultimately concluded that he was\nnot because the grand jury is an arm of the court, and the plaintiff's testimony was thus generated\nby a court โ and not an agency โ of the United States.  See id. at 232-33.   \nThat is not the situation here.  The proposed portective orders in this lawsuit will not protect\nfrom disclosure records generated by a court of the United States.  The records involved in the\ndiscovery process will be generated by the parties, one of which is an agency of the United States\nand subject to the FOIA.  Valenti is thus inapposite.\nNotwithstanding this finding, however, the Court finds that a protective order prohibiting\nparties from publicly disseminating information gleaned through the pre-trial discovery process is\nwarranted here.  Given the highly sensitive natureo f this lawsuit and the potential for abuse through\nthe media, the Court finds Signal's arguments persuasive on this point.  The case law is rife with\nsupport for the argument that no party to a laws uit has a First Amendment right to disseminate\n13\n\ninformation obtained through the pre-trial discoveryp rocess, and this Courts' discretion is broad on\nthis point.   See, e.g. Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart , 467 U.S. 20 (1984) (holding that when \"a\nprotective order is entered on a showing of good cause as required by Rule 26(c), is limited to the\ncontext of pre-trial civil di scovery, and does not  restrict the dissemination of the information if\ngained from other sources, it does not offend the First Amendment.\"); Harris v. Amoco Prod. Co.,\n768 F.2d 669 (5th Cir. 1985) (holdingt hat the EEOC was not entitled to \"receive full use of amterial\ndiscovered as an intervenor, whether that use is further investigation, litigation, or intera gency\ncooperation.\"); Greene v. Thalhimer's Dep't Store, 93 F.R.D. 657, 661 (E.D. Va. 1982) (limiting use\nof discovered material relating to EEOC conciliation efforts).\nWhile the Court recognizes that Signal's request is broad โ and the EEOC and intervenors\nobject to such an expansive protective order โ the Court also recognizes the highly sensitive nature\nof this lawsuit.  There has already been substantial media coverage of this lawsuit, and there is the\npotential for more.  This Court finds that the material gleaned through the pre-trial discovery process\nshould be limited to the preparation for and use at trial and for no other purpose until this dispute\nis resolved, through trial or settlement.  This Court can not fathom why the dissemination of any\ninformation obtained through the discovery process ouwteighs the privacy interest of the parties and\nnon-parties at this time.  And the EEOCs' interest in complying with FOIA is of no moment pending\ntrial.   See Harris, 768 F.2d at 685.  The EEOCs' obligations under FOIA are limited to requests by\nthe public, which at this time are negligible at best concerning this lawsuit.  There is no mandatory\ndissemination requirement under the FOIA.       \nWith regard to the production of electronically-stored information (\"ESI\"), the Court notes\nthat Rules 34 governs the production of such data.  The parties are the masters of their production\n14\n\nrequests, and they may request ESI in any format allowed under the rules.  Autotech Techs. Ltd.\nP'ship v. Automationdirect.com, Inc., 248 F.R.D 556, 560 (N.D. Ill. 2008).   The protective order\nin David [Doc. #1352] is inapplicable here.\nWith regard to the addresses and telephone numbers of former Signal employees, the Court\nfinds that the parties may disseminate such information to persons deemed in good faith necessary\nto the prosecution of  the lawsuit.    And lastl y, the Court will not order  the parties to serve a\nsubpoena on a non-party should it wish to speak said non-party.  Such a practice would be a waste\nof the Court's and the parties' resources.  \nV. Conclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons,\nIT IS ORDERED that the EEOCs' Motion for Protective Order [Doc. #207] and the Motion\nof Defendant Signal International, L.L.C. for Protective Order [Doc. #208]  are GRANTED IN\nPART and DENIED IN PART as outlined above.  The parties shall meet and confer no later than\nten (10) days from the date of this Order  to confect a protective order in conformity with this\nCourt's reasoning, and  no later than ten (10) days from said date , the parties shall f ile said\nprotective order for this Court's approval.\nNew Orleans, Louisiana, this 10th day of September, 2013.\n                                                                       \n DANIEL E.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nEASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA\nEQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY CIVIL ACTION\nCOMMISSION, ET AL.\nVERSUS NO:  12-557\nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL, LLC SECTION: \"A\" (3)\nORDER\nThe Court has considered the partiesโ arguments with respect to\nthe issue of consolidation and concludes that the David and EEOC\ncases will not be consolidated at this time.\nThe Court has already decided that the discrimination claims\nagainst Signal will be tried separately in the EEOC case.  (Rec. Doc.\n78).  Thus, the minimal overlap that the David and EEOC cases share\nis going to be eliminated.  Because both the David and EEOC cases\nwill always be pending on the same district judgeโs docket, formal\nconsolidation is not necessary to ensure that all common legal\nquestions are tried together, or to minimize the occurrences of\nhaving to present evidence more than once.  The EEOC case is\nstatutorily entitled to expedited consideration,1 and the Court is\nconvinced that consolidation with the larger and older David matter\nwill only serve to hinder the partiesโ efforts to comply with the\nstatutory mandate.\nDefendantsโ arguments so vehemently in favor of consolidation\n1 \nIt shall be the duty of the judge designatedp ursuant to this\nsubsection to assign the case for hearing at the earliest\npracticable date and to cause the case to  be in every way\nexpedited.  If  such judge has not scheduled the case for\ntrial within one hundred and twentyd ays after issue has been\njoined, that judge may appoint a master pursuant to rule 53\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n42 U.S.C. A. ยง 2000e-5(f)(5) (West 2003 & Supp. 2011).\n\nsuggest that they fail to recognize that consolidation does not alter\nthe partiesโ substantive rights.  Thus, contrary to the position that\nSignal takes, consolidation has no effect on whether the David\ndecision base applies in the EEOC matterโ-the law governing\npreclusion will determine that regardless of whether the cases are\nconsolidated.  Nor is consolidation necessary in order to avoid\nrepetitive and possibly conflicting legal determinations because the\nDavid and EEOC cases will always be pending before the same district\njudge from this point forward.  And because the David and EEOC cases\nare pending before the same district judge and the same magistrate\njudge, the parties will be compelled to engage in a coordinated\ndiscovery process, again regardless of whether or not the cases are\nconsolidated.  All parties recognize the need to conduct discovery\nefficiently.\nIn short, consolidation solves none of the concerns that Signal\nraises, and it could only lead to inadvertent delay of both the David\nand EEOC cases.\nAccordingly, and for the foregoing reasons;\nIT IS ORDERED that the Motion to Deny Consolidation (Rec. Doc.\n64) filed by the EEOC is GRANTED.  \nApril 2, 2012\n  _______________________________\n  JAY C. ZAINEY\n   UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n2",

These actions involve\nallegations that roughly 590 Indian welders and piperfitters were lured to work for Signal through\nthe fraudulent promise of legal and permanent work-based immigration to the United States, and that\nthey subsequently were subjected to forced labor and other abuses at Signalโs facilities in Pascagoula,\nMississippi, and Orange, Texas. \nDefendants Sachin Dewan, Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd., Malvern C. Burnett, Gulf Coast\nImmigration Law Center, LLC, and the Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, APC, support the motion\nto centralize.  The Equal Opportunity Employment Commission (EEOC) and some 190-plus\nindividual  plaintiffsโtogether  comprising  all  the  plaintiffs  in  the  twelve  actions  on  the\nmotionโoppose centralization. \nOn the basis of the papers filed and hearing session held, we will deny plaintiffsโ motion. \nAlthough these actions share some factual questions arising out of the alleged fraudulent scheme to\ntraffick plaintiffs into the United States to work at Signalโs facilities and the terms and conditions of\nemployment after they were hired by Signal, we are not persuaded that Section 1407 centralization\nis necessary either to assure the convenience of the parties and witnesses or for the just and efficient\nconduct of this litigation.  As both of the underlying courts have recognized, each individual plaintiff\nmust prove how he was recruited, the abuse he allegedly suffered while working for Signal, and the\ndamages caused to him by the alleged fraudulent scheme and discriminatory work conditions.  These\nindividualized facts very well may predominate over the common factual issues alleged by plaintiffs. \nMore significantly, all of the actions are progressing rapidly towards trial.  Jury trial of the\nMississippi plaintiffsโ claims in the first-filed David action in the Eastern District of Louisiana is\nscheduled for January of 2015.  Fact discovery in the first two actions filed in the Eastern District of\nTexas will close in less than two months, and trials in those actions are also set for early- to mid-\n* Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle took no part in the decision of this matter.\n\nCase C2a:1s2e- cMvD-0L0 5N5o7. -2S5M5-4D  E DKo  c uDmoceunmt 7e6n t   4F5il1e d   F0i8le/1d2 0/184/1  2 P/1a4g e   P2a ogfe 3 2 of 3\n-2-\n2015.  Much, if not all, of the โcommonโ factual discovery undoubtedly has been completed already,\nas more than a hundred daysโ worth of depositions have been conducted. \nFurthermore, there has been substantial inter-district and intra-district coordination.  All seven\nof the Louisiana actions have been assigned to Judge Susie Morgan, who has ordered five of the\nactions consolidated (all save the action by the EEOC) and that discovery of all the Louisiana actions\nbe conducted in a coordinated fashion so as to avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts.  Similarly,\nthe Texas actions have been referred to the same magistrate judge.  Consent orders have been entered\nin those actions allowing the Texas plaintiffs full access to the written discovery, document discovery,\nand depositions from the Louisiana actions.  Thus, โinformal cooperation among the involved\nattorneys and coordination between the involved courts seems preferable to formal centralization.โ \nSee In re Adderall XR (Amphetamine/Dextroamphetamine) Mktg., Sales Practices & Antitrust Litig.,\n968 F. Supp. 2d 1343, 1345 (J.P.M.L. 2013).  This is particularly so where the main effect of\ncentralization would not be to enhance convenience and efficiency, but to delay the progress of these\nactions, which are swiftly moving towards trial.  See In re DietGoal Innovations, LLC (โ561) Patent\nLitig., MDL No. 2507, __ F. Supp. 2d __, 2014 WL 709762, at *1 (J.P.M.L.

CAUSE NO. 1:11CV179-LG-RHW\nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL, LLC        DEFENDANT\nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO TRANSFER\nBEFORE THE COURT is the [26] Motion to Stay and Transfer Pursuant to\nthe First-Filed Rule filed by Defendant Signal International, LLC (\"Signal\").  Signal\nseeks a stay of these proceedings and asks the Court to transfer this action to the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, where, Signal\nclaims, a \"closely related . . . earlier suit is pending.\"  Plaintiff Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") has filed a response [29] opposing the motion. \nThe Court has reviewed the parties' briefs and relevant law, and finds that the\nmotion to stay and transfer should be granted.  The EEOC filed a [34] Motion to\nStrike Portions of Defendant's Reply Memorandum Further Supporting Motion to\nStay and Transfer.  The motion to strike should be denied as moot.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nThe EEOC filed this Title VII action against Signal in April 2011.  The\ncomplaint seeks to \"correct unlawful employment practices on the basis of national\norigin, race, and retaliation.\"  The lawsuit arises from charges filed with the EEOC\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 52   Filed 02/29/12   Page 2 of 12\nby two Indian national employees, Vijayan and Kadakkarappally.  According to the\ncomplaint, the EEOC issued Determinations with respect to those charges,\nconcluding that Signal had discriminated against Vijayan and Kadakkarappally\nand other Indian employees as a class, and that it had retaliated against Vijayan\nand Kadakkarappally because they opposed Signal's conduct.  The complaint seeks\nrelief for Vijayan and Kadakkarappally, as well as \"a class of over 500 similarly\nsituated Indian nationals\" who were brought to the United States from India to\nwork at Signal facilities in Mississippi and Texas.  The complaint includes several\nclaims against Signal under Title VII, including allegations of a hostile work\nenvironment based on race and/or national origin, \"disparate, segregated, and\ndiscriminatory treatment\" in the terms and conditions of employment, retaliation,\nand a pattern or practice of discrimination based on race and/or national origin.  \nSignal seeks a stay and transfer of the EEOC's action (\"the present action\") to\nthe Eastern District of Louisiana.  Signal argues that the present action is closely\nrelated to a similar lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of Louisiana in March 2008,\nDavid, et al. v. Signal, et al., No. 2:08-CV-1220-JCZ-DEK (hereinafter \"David\"). \nSignal submits that under the \"first filed\" rule, this case should be transferred so\nthat its issues can be resolved with David.\nThe EEOC is not a party to David, but Signal is one of twelve defendants in\nthat action.1  The plaintiffs in David are a number of Indian nationals who were\n1  The David Defendants are: Signal International L.L.C; Malvern C.

See\nMot. to Intervene, Ex. 2, ECF No. 2-2.  The motion to intervene was granted on\nJanuary 24, 2012.  See Order Granting Mot. to Intervene, ECF No. 44.  Intervenor\nPlaintiffs in this action are Sabulal Vijayan, Jacob Joseph Kadakkarappally, and\nKurian David.\nThe David complaint asserts \"class action claims arising from violations of\"\nthe Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), the Victims of\nTrafficking and Violence Protection Act (TVPA), 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1985,\nthe Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and claims of fraud/negligent\nmisrepresentation, and breach of contract.3  Several plaintiffs, including Vijayan\nand Kadakkarappally, also bring individual claims of retaliation under ยง 1981 and ยง\n1985, and claims of false imprisonment, assault, battery, and infliction of emotional\nA.P.C.; Indo-Ameri Soft L.L.C.; Kurella Rao; J & M Associates, Inc. of Mississippi; Billy\nR. Wilks; J & M Marine & Industrial, L.L.C.; Global Resources, Inc.; Michael Pol;\nSachin Dewan; and Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd. (a/k/a MedTech Consultants).  Signal\nhas also filed claims against a third-party defendant, Zito Companies, LLC.\n2 A group of approximately five hundred Indian nationals (the same group on\nwhose behalf the EEOC filed the present suit) had sought class certification in David\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.  The United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Louisiana denied the motion to certify the class on January 4, 2012.\nSee Def.'s Notice of Supplemental Authority, Ex. 1, ECF No. 42-1. \n3  The plaintiffs in David have filed a complaint and two amended complaints.\n3\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 52   Filed 02/29/12   Page 4 of 12\ndistress.  The complaint in David does not allege violations of Title VII, but the\nplaintiffs' Section 1981 retaliation claims are based on allegations of employment\ndiscrimination against Defendant Signal.  See Second Amended Complaint at ยถยถ\n333-345, David et al. v. Signal et al., No. 2:08-cv-1220-JCZ-DEK (E.D. La.), ECF No.\n944.\nDISCUSSION\nI.  Motion to Stay and Transfer Pursuant to the First-to-File Rule\nThe \"first to file\" rule permits a district court to decline jurisdiction over an\naction when it involves the same parties and issues as a previously-filed action in\nanother court.  When related cases are pending before two federal courts, the court\nin which the case was last filed may dismiss or transfer the case if it involves\nsubstantially similar issues which can be resolved in the earlier-filed action. See W.\nGulf Mar. Ass'n v. ILA Deep Sea Local 24, 751 F.2d 721, 728-29 (5th Cir. 1985) and\nSave Power Ltd. v. Syntek Fin. Corp., 121 F.3d 947, 950 (5th Cir.1997).  \"The\nconcern manifestly is to avoid the waste of duplication, to avoid rulings which may\ntrench upon the authority of sister courts, and to avoid piecemeal resolution of\nissues that call for a uniform result.\"  W. Gulf Mar. Ass'n, 751 F.2d at 728. \nThe Court's inquiry is focused on whether the two cases \"substantially\noverlap,\" but where the overlap is \"less than complete, the judgment is made case\nby case, based on such factors as the extent of overlap, the likelihood of conflict, the\ncomparative advantage and the interest of each forum in resolving the dispute.โ\nSave Power Ltd., 121 F.3d at 951.  The first-to-file rule is a discretionary doctrine. \n4\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 52   Filed 02/29/12   Page 5 of 12\nCadle Co. v. Whataburger of Alice, Inc., 174 F.3d 599, 603 (5th Cir. 1999) (citing\nKerotest Mfg. Co. v. C-O-Two Fire Equip. Co., 342 U.S. 180, 183-84 (1952)).  It is not\na rigid or inflexible rule to be mechanically applied.  Mann Mfg., Inc. v. Hortex, Inc.,\n439 F.2d 403, 407 (5th Cir. 1971).  The decision of whether to apply the first-to-file\nrule involves determinations concerning \"[w]ise judicial administration, giving\nregard to conservation of judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of\nlitigation.\"  Kerotest, 342 U.S. at 183.  \nIn support of its motion, Signal essentially argues two major points: (i) that\nthe issues and parties in the two actions are similar enough to invoke the first-to-\nfile rule and transfer the present action to the Eastern District of Louisiana; and (ii)\nthe relevant \"equitable considerations\" under the first-to-file rule further warrant a\ntransfer.  In response, the EEOC acknowledges that David was filed first, but\nargues that the motion to transfer should be denied because (i) the first-to-file rule\nis not applicable in this case because there are differences between the parties and\nthe issues, and (ii) venue is not proper in the Eastern District of Louisiana. \nThe Issues\nSignal argues that because David alleges intentional employment\ndiscrimination in violation of ยง 1981 and ยง 1985, the issues in David are\nsubstantially similar to the Title VII claims in the present action.  Essentially,\nSignal argues that in both actions, the plaintiffs will be required to prove\nintentional discrimination on the part of Signal.  Signal submits that the Court's\ninquiry into the defendant's discriminatory intent or motive will be the same under\n5\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 52   Filed 02/29/12   Page 6 of 12\nTitle VII and ยง 1981 and ยง 1985.\nIn response, the EEOC argues that the claims and issues in David are vastly\ndifferent from those in the present action, and the two cases do not substantially\noverlap.  The David complaint does not include claims under Title VII, but alleges\nclaims under a range of statutes, including, but not limited to, the TVPA, RICO, the\nThirteenth Amendment, and the FLSA.  The EEOC argues that in comparison, the\npresent action is much smaller in scope, as it only alleges that one defendant\nviolated Title VII.  While the EEOC concedes that the ยง 1981 and retaliation claims\nin David are similar to those in the present action, it argues this is not sufficient to\nfind that the present action is \"duplicative\" of David. \nThe employment discrimination claims in David are similar to the Title VII\nclaims brought by the EEOC in the present action, and they appear to arise from\nthe same conduct on the part of Signal.  The Court's examination of Signal's\ndiscriminatory conduct under Title VII would likely be very similar to an inquiry\ninto the same conduct under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981.  \"[T]he inquiry into intentional\ndiscrimination is essentially the same for individual actions brought under sections\n1981 . . . and Title VII.โ Lauderdale v. Tex. Dep't of Criminal Justice, Inst. Div., 512\nF.3d 157, 166 (5th Cir. 2007).  Presumably, the same or similar evidence would be\nused to support ยง 1981 claims and Title VII claims.  It follows that the discovery\nnecessary to litigate the employment discrimination claims in David would likely be\nduplicative of discovery in the present action.  The Court finds that, because the\nemployment discrimination claims arise from the same conduct, and in light of the\n6\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 52   Filed 02/29/12   Page 7 of 12\nlikely duplication of discovery of those claims, the similarity of issues weighs in\nfavor of a transfer.\nThe Parties\nSignal argues that \"David was voluntarily filed by the same Indian nationals\nfor whose benefit the present suit was filed.\"  (Def.'s Mem. at 7, ECF No. 27). \nSignal also asserts that David seeks individual relief for Plaintiffs Vijayan and\nKadakkarappally, who were the charging parties in the present action.  \nThe EEOC submits that it is not a party to David, and that it has no right to\nintervene in that case because the plaintiffs in David never received a notice of\nright to sue from the EEOC, as required under 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-5(f)(1), and have\nnot alleged a Title VII claim in their complaint.  The EEOC does concede that\nseveral of the David plaintiffs moved to intervene in the present action.  As noted\nsupra, that motion has been granted.   \nThe intervention of the private plaintiffs in this action has resulted in greater\nsimilarity of parties between the present action and David than when this action\nwas originally filed.  Intervenor Plaintiffs in this action are Sabulal Vijayan, Jacob\nJoseph Kadakkarappally, and Kurian David; each of these individuals is a named\nplaintiff in David.  The Court also notes that the EEOC brings this suit on behalf of\nthe same group of Indian nationals who filed David.   However, the EEOC is not a\nparty to David, and there are eleven other defendants in David who are not parties\nto the present action.  The Court also recognizes that the Title VII claims in this\nsuit are brought by the EEOC, and the EEOC is a distinct entity from the plaintiffs\n7\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 52   Filed 02/29/12   Page 8 of 12\nin David.  As an agency of the United States, the EEOC litigates on behalf of the\npublic interest as well as the aggrieved individuals, and therefore its interests in\nthis action differ to some degree from the private plaintiffs.  See EEOC v. Harris\nChernin, Inc., 10 F.3d 1286, 1291 (7th Cir. 1993) (\"The EEOC['s] interests are\nbroader than those of the individuals injured by discrimination.\") (citations\nomitted).  \nHowever, the first-filed rule does not require that the cases and the parties be\nidentical.  Save Power Ltd., 121 F.3d at 950.  The Fifth Circuit has held that the\n\"crucial inquiry is one of 'substantial overlap.\"  Id.  โ[R]egardless of whether or not\nthe suits here are identical, if they overlap on the substantive issues, the cases\nwould be required to be consolidated in ... the jurisdiction first seized of the issues.โ\nId. (citing Mann Mfg., Inc., 439 F.2d at 408 n. 6 and TPM Holdings, Inc. v.\nIntra-Gold Indus., Inc., 91 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1996)).  While the parties in these two\nactions are not identical because the claims in David are more numerous and\ndiverse, the employment discrimination claims in David are made only against\nDefendant Signal, just as the Title VII claims in the present action are against\nSignal.  It is apparent that the Title VII claims in the present action are based on\nthe same alleged conduct by Signal that forms the basis for the Section 1981 claims\nin David.   Therefore, the substantive issues involved in the retaliation and\nemployment-based claims in this action are similar to those in David, and the\nlitigation of these claims will involve several of the same parties as those in David.\nEquitable Considerations\n8\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 52   Filed 02/29/12   Page 9 of 12\nSignal also argues that the \"equitable considerations\" of the first-to-file rule\nweigh in favor of transfer.  In support of this assertion, Signal submits that the\nEEOC's filing of this case represents a \"collateral attack\" on the David Court's\nruling on the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. (Def.'s Mem. at 13).\nSpecifically, Signal asserts that the timing of the case before this Court is\n\"suspicious\" because it was filed exactly five months after the plaintiffs in David\nsuffered an adverse ruling with respect to their claims for class-wide injunctive\nrelief.  See Def.'s Ex. C, ECF No. 27-3) (transcript of hearing in which Judge Zainey\nruled that plaintiffs did not have standing to seek future injunctive relief against\nSignal).  Signal argues that this action, therefore, \"looks like a collateral attack on\nthe first court's ruling.\" (Def.'s Mem. at 12, ECF No. 27).  \nThe Court is not convinced that the EEOC's filing of the present action is a\ncollateral attack on the David Court's ruling regarding class-wide injunctive relief\nbased on Signal's assertions in its brief.  Any finding with respect to the timing of\nthe EEOC's lawsuit would be highly speculative on the part of the Court.  The\nCourt will not grant the motion to transfer on this basis.\nVenue\nThe EEOC argues that venue of the present action is not proper in the\nEastern District of Louisiana, and therefore the motion to transfer should be\ndenied.  The EEOC argues that venue is proper in the Southern District of\nMississippi under Title VII because most of the alleged unlawful practices occurred\n9\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 52   Filed 02/29/12   Page 10 of 12\nin this district, and Signal's principal place of business is in Mississippi.4 \nSignal argues that the issue of venue under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1404(a) is not\nrelevant to the question of whether to transfer this action pursuant to the first-filed\nrule.  Signal also points out that the David plaintiffs chose the Eastern District of\nLouisiana as their forum.  Of course, the same argument can be made for the EEOC\nin the present action; as the plaintiff, the EEOC chose this forum in which to\nlitigate this action.  However, the EEOC is a federal agency with an office in New\nOrleans.  It seems that the EEOC would be equally capable of litigating an action in\nNew Orleans as it would in this district.  While Signal's place of business may be in\nMississippi, it is currently defending the David action in Louisiana with counsel\nlocated in New Orleans.  As Signal points out, the individual intervenor plaintiffs in\nthis action chose to file the David action in Louisiana, and continue to litigate\nthere.  Therefore, those plaintiffs are available to the EEOC in Louisiana.  The\nEEOC does not argue that any witnesses or evidence will be less available to it in\nLouisiana than in this district.  The distance between this district and the Eastern\nDistrict of Louisiana is not great.  The Court does not see that the parties will lack\naccess to necessary resources by litigating this action in the Eastern District of\n4  The EEOC submits that the explicit Title VII venue provision applies to this\naction, which provides that venue is proper in \"any district in the State in which the\nunlawful employment practice is alleged to have been committed,\" or in the district\nwhere  \"the  employment  records  relevant  to  such  practices  are  maintained  or\nadministered,\" or in the district where \"the aggrieved person would have worked but\nfor the alleged unlawful employment practice.\"  42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-5(f)(3).  Title VII\nfurther provides that if the defendant is not in any of these districts, then an action\nmay be filed in the district in which the defendant's principal office is located.  Id.\n10\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 52   Filed 02/29/12   Page 11 of 12\nLouisiana.  \n\"The Fifth Circuit adheres to the general rule that the court in which an\naction is first filed is the appropriate court to determine whether subsequently filed\ncases involving substantially similar issues should proceed.\"  Save Power Ltd., 121\nF.3d at 950 (citing West Gulf Maritime Ass'n, 751 F.2d at 728, and Mann Mfg., Inc.,\n439 F.2d at 408). The Court finds that, given that these two actions arise from the\nsame conduct, the similarity of the substantive issues involved in the employment\ndiscrimination and retaliation claims alleged in the two actions, and the similarity\nof the parties, Signal's motion to stay and transfer should be granted.\nII.  The EEOC's Motion to Strike \nThe EEOC has moved to strike portions of Signal's reply memorandum in\nsupport of its Motion to Stay or Transfer [33] on the grounds that new arguments\nwere raised in the reply brief.  Specifically, Signal made arguments under the Fifth\nCircuit's decision in Truvillion v. King's Daughters Hospital, 614 F.2d 520 (5th Cir.\n1980), and asks the Court to consider invoking 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(b) and certify this\nissue to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.  Neither of these arguments were raised\nin Signal's initial motion.  \nSignal asserts that under Truvillion v. King's Daughters Hospital, 614 F.2d\n520 (5th Cir. 1980), the EEOC could have intervened in David if it issued right to\nsue letters nunc pro tunc.  Truvillion held that where the EEOC files an action that\nis dismissed on jurisdictional or procedural grounds, and the EEOC does not file a\nsecond action, \"it may validly issue a right-to-sue letter to an aggrieved person,\" so\n11\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 52   Filed 02/29/12   Page 12 of 12\nthat the private plaintiff could file his or her own action.  614 F.2d at 528.  Here,\nthe EEOC's suit has not been dismissed as procedurally or jurisdictionally defective. \nTherefore, the Court does not consider Truvillion to be controlling. \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Defendant\nSignal's [26] Motion to Stay or Transfer is GRANTED.  This matter is transferred\nto the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Plaintiff EEOC's [34]\nMotion to Strike is DENIED AS MOOT.\nSO ORDERED AND ADJUDGED this the 29th day of February, 2012.\nLouis Guirola, Jr.\ns/  \nLOUIS GUIROLA, JR.\nCHIEF U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE\n12",

Signal International (Civil Action No. 12-557)\nORDER AND REASONS\nBefore the Court are two motions filed in theE  EOC v. Signal International, LLC et\nal matter (Civil Action No. 12-557; โEEOCโ): (1) plaintiff Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommissionโs (โEEOCโ) โMotion to Strike or  Alternative ly to Dismiss Defendantโs\nAffirmative Answers,โ1 and (2) plaintiff-intervenors Vijayan, Kadakkarappally, and Davidโs\nโMotion to Strike, or Alternatively, to Dismiss, Defendant Signalโs Affirmative Defenses.โ2\nDefendant Signal International, LLC (โSignalโ) filed an opposition to both Motions in one\n1 R. Doc. 103.\n2 R. Doc. 110.\n1\n\ndocument.3\nEEOC seeks an Order from this Court striking all 17 affirmative defenses contained\nin Signalโs โAnswer and Affirmative Defensesโ4 to the EEOCโs complaint.5  Plaintiffs seek\nan order from this Court striking all 19 of  the affirmative defenses contained in Signalโs\nโAnswer and Affirmative Defensesโ 6 to the plaintiff-intervenorsโ class complaint in\nintervention.  Both EEOC and plaintiff-intervenors argue that Signalโs affirmative defenses\nare legally invalid, that they are legally insufficient under the pleading standard set forth\nin the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, that they do no respond to a single cause of action,\nthat they deprive EEOC and the palintiff-intervenors of fair notice to the defenses claimed,\nthat they are either conclusoryo r merely a denial of the pledaings, and thus insufficient and\nredundant, and that they shouldb e stricken from the record.  In response, Signal argues its\naffirmative answers satisfy the pleading stan dard set forth by Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure 8(b) and 8(c), and are thus suffici ent for purposes of Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 12(f), because the amount of detail required for a sufficiently pled affirmative\ndefense is lower than the amount of detail that must be included in a complaint.\nThe Court agrees with EEOC and plainti ff-intervenors that certain affirmative\ndefenses asserted by Signal must be stricken, but notes that Signal should be given an\n3 R. Doc. 112.\n4 R. Doc. 91.\n5 In its motion to strike, EEOC also requests that Signalโs โTwenty-Second through Twenty-Fifthโ\ndefenses and Signalโs โTwenty-Seventh through Fortieth-Third [sic]โ defenses.  See R. Doc. 103 at p. 1. \nSignal asserts only 17 affirmative defenses, all of which EEOC seeks to strike.  If EEOC seeks to strike\nanything else from Signalโs answer, EEOC failed to provide justification for such an order.  To the extent\nEEOCโs motion to strike requests an order striking anything beyond Signalโs affirmative defenses, the\nmotion is denied.\n6 R. Doc. 90.\n2\n\nopportunity to amend its affirmative defenses and re-urge them in a timely fashion.  โThe\ncourt may strike from a plead ing an insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial,\nimpertinent, or scandalous matter.โ  FED. R. CIV. P. 12(f).  An affirmative defense is โsubject\nto the same pleading requirement as i s the complaint,โ and a defendant โmust plead an\naffirmative defense with enough specificity or factual particularity to give the plaintiff โfair\nnoticeโ of the defense that is being advanced.โ  Woodfield v. Bowman, 193 F.3d 354, 362\n(5th Cir.1999).  Federal Rule of Civil P rocedure 8 provides the requirements that all\npleadings must satisfy, and subsecti ons (b) and (c) of the Rule govern the pleading\nrequirements for defenses and affirmative defenses, respectively.  Under Rule 8(b) and (c),\na defendant must โstate in short and plain terms its defenses to eachc laim asserted against\nitโ and must โaffirmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense . . . .โ FED. R. CIV. P.\n8(b)(1)(A) and (c)(1).7\nA motion to strike under Rule 12(f) โis a drastic remedy to be resorted to only when\nrequired for the purposes of justice.โ Augustus v. Board of Pub.

Avondale Shipyards, Inc,. 677 F.2d 1045, 1057 (5thC  ir. 1982).  โ[E]ven when\ntechnically appropriate and well-founded,โ motions to strike are not be granted โin the\n7 Signal, EEOC, and the plaintiff-intervenors all argue for varying degrees of application of the\nwell-known Twombly-Iqbal pleading standard to Signalโs affirmative defenses.  See Bell Atl. Corp. v.\nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007); Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009).  Signal argues that this standard,\nwhich the Court uses when analyzing the sufficiency of a complaint, does not apply to affirmative defenses. \nEEOC and the plaintiff-intervenors argue that Twombly-Iqbal does apply to affirmative defenses, and that\nSignalโs affirmative defenses do not meet the facial plausibility standard created by those two cases.  The\nCourt need not resolve this dispute, however, as the โfair noticeโ standard set forth by Rule 8 and the Fifth\nCircuit in Woodfield is a lower threshold than Twombly-Iqbal, and Signalโs affirmative answers do not\nmeet even that lowered standard.\n3\n\nabsence of a showing of prejudice to the moving party.Aโ bene v. Jaybar, LLC, 802 F. Supp.\n716, 723 (E.D. La. 2011) (quoting 5C Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, FEDERAL\nPRACTICE AND PROCEDURE ยง 1381 (3d ed. 2004)).

Jan. 3, 1996).\nSignalโs affirmative answer s are, for the most part, as EEOC and the plaintiff-\nintervenors both characterize them, โshotgunโ pleadings, devoid  of the kind of factual\nspecificity EEOC and the plaintiff-intervenors would need to have fair notice of the defesnes\nSignal is asserting, and to which particular  causes of action Signal is claiming each\nparticular defense is meant to apply.   See Woodfield, 193 F.3d at 362.  B ecause Signalโs\naffirmative defenses are vague and conclusory, EEOC and the plaintiff-intervenors would\nbe prejudiced if they were required to litigate every possible application of each and every\ndefense.  However, this is an issue that can be remedied if Signal better defines the defenses\nit is asserting to at least comply with the fair notice requirement of Rule 8 of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure.  By adding more detail to each of its affirmative defenses and\nexplicitly stating which defenses apply to whichc auses of action, Signal will be able to assert\nall of the affirmative defenses it sees fit, teh EEOC and the plaintiff-intervenors will be given\nfair notice of those defenses and be able top repare to litigate those issues, and this matter\ncan continue to move forward.                  \nAccordingly, IT IS ORD ERED that Motions to Strike be and hereby are\nGRANTED IN PART, as set forth above.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the following affirmative defenses contained in\nSignalโs Answer and Affirmative Defenses  to EEOCโs complaint be and hereby are\n4\n\nSTRICKEN, as they are impermissibly vague: 8 and 11.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the following affirmative defenses contained in\nSignalโs Answer and Affirmative Defenses  to EEOCโs complaint be and hereby are\nSTRICKEN, as they are merely conclusory denials o fEEOCโs pleadings: 1, 4, 5, 9, and 12-\n17.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the following affirmative defenses contained in\nSignalโs Answer and Affirmative Defenses  to EEOCโs complaint be and hereby are\nSTRICKEN, as they are not directed at any particular cause of action, and thus deprive\nEEOC of fair notice of the defense claimed  and which cause of action that defense is\nsupposed to apply to: 2, 3, 6, 7, and 10.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the following affirmative defenses contained in\nSignalโs Answer and Affirmative Defenses to  plaintiff-intervenorsโ class complaint in\nintervention be and hereby are STRICKEN, as they are impermissibly vague: 8 and 11.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the following affirmative defenses contained in\nSignalโs Answer and Affirmative Defenses to  plaintiff-intervenorsโ class complaint in\nintervention be and hereby are  STRICKEN, as they are merely conclusory denials of\nplaintiff-intervenorsโ pleadings, and thus redundant: 1, 4, 5, 9, and 12-19.  Paragraph 117A\nof Signalโs Answer and Affirmative Defenses  is also stri cken, as it is redundant and\nconfusing.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the following affirmative defenses contained in\nSignalโs Answer and Affirmative Defenses to  plaintiff-intervenorsโ class complaint in\nintervention be and hereby are STRICKEN, as they are not directed at any particular cause\nof action, and thus deprive plaintiff-intervenors of fair notice of the defense claimed and\n5\n\nwhich cause of action that defense is supposed to apply to: 2, 3, 6, 7, and 10.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Signal shall re-urge its answers and affirmative\ndefenses within fourteen (14) days of the entry of this Order, amending both pleadings\nto correct the issues described above.\nNew Orleans, Louisiana, this _2_0_th_ day of May, 2013.\n_____________________________\n       SUSIE MORGAN\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\nCourt to Notify:\nMagistrate Judge Daniel E.

Signal International, LLC et al (Civil\nAction No. 08-1220) (โDavidโ)\nORDER AND REASONS\nBefore the Court is the David Plaintiffsโ motion to โreconsider in limited partโ1 the\nCourtโs order of June 11, 20132 in which the Court denied defendant Signal International,\nLLCโs (โSignalโ) motion to sever.3  For the reasons set forth below, the  David Plaintiffsโ\nmotion to reconsider is denied.\nBACKGROUND\nOn March 16, 2012, while the above-captioned cases were pending in Section โAโ of\n1 R. Doc. 1355.\n2 R. Doc. 1349.\n3 R. Doc. 1196.\n1\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 206   Filed 07/15/13   Page 2 of 7\nthis Court, Judge Zainey considered competing case management proposals after denying\nthe David Plaintiffsโ motion to certify David as a Rule 23 class action.  TheD avid Plaintiffs\nproposed that all twelve named plaintiffs be tried together, while Signal, along with other\nDavid defendants, proposed that each plaintiffโs case be tried individually.  Judge Zainey\ndetermined that the initial David trial will involve five of thet welve named plaintiffs, with\nthree of those plaintiffs picked by theD  avid Plaintiffs and two picked by Signal.S  ee David\nv. Signal Intern., LLC, No. 08-1220, 2013 WL 2631427, at * 1& n. 5 (E.D. La. June 11, 2013). \nAfter the cases were transferred, this Courta dopted Judge Zaineyโs case management plan\non June 15, 2012.  Id.  Signal then moved to sever the David Plaintiffsโ cases, again asking\nthat each of theD  avid Plaintiffs have a separate trial.I  d. The Court denied Signalโs motion\nto sever, noting that it was essentially a motion to reconsider Judge Zaineyโs prior ruling\nand that โ[b]oth Judge Zainey and this Co urt have already evaluated this case and\ndetermined that it will proceed under one case number with twelve named plaintiffs, and\nthat the first trial in this matter will have five named plaintiffs; three chosen by plaintiffs\nand two chosen by defendants.โ  Id. at *3.  \nFresh on the heels of the Coutrโs denial of Signalโs request for reconsideration (under\nthe guise of a motion to sever), the  David Plaintiffs are now seeking reconsideration of\nJudge Zaineyโs case management plan.  The David Plaintiffs ask the Court to reconsider\nJudge Zaineyโs March 16, 2012 decision to allow Signal to pick two of the plaintiffs for the\nfirst David trial and this Courtโs adoption of that plan in June 2012 and reaffirmation of\nthat plan in June 2013.  The David Plaintiffs argue that reconsideration of that decision is\nnecessary to prevent manifest injustice.  In response, 4 Signal argues that the  David\n4 See R. Doc. 1358.\n2\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 206   Filed 07/15/13   Page 3 of 7\nPlaintiffsโ motion to reconsider  is untimely and that allowing Signal to pick two of the\nplaintiffs in the first David trial will not result in manifest injustice.\nSTANDARD OF LAW\nA  timely filed motion to reconsider an interlocutory order is evaluated under the\nsame standard as a motion to alter or amend a final judgment brought pursuant to Rule\n59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Proce dure.  See, e.g. Castrillo v. Am. Home Mortg.\nServicing, Inc., No. 09-4369, 2010 WL 1424398, at * 3โ4 (E.D. La. Apr. 5, 2010) (โThe\ngeneral practice of thi s court has been to  evaluate motions to reconsider interlocutory\norders under the same standards that govern Rule 59(e) motions to alter or amend a final\njudgment.โ).   A Rule 59(e) motion must be filed within twenty-eight days of the entry of\njudgment.  See FED. R. CIV. P. 54(b).  A motion to reconsider filed outside thi s 28-day\nwindow is evaluated under the standards governing a motion for relief from final judgment\nunder Rule 60(b).  Stangel v. United States, 68 F.3d 857, 859 (5th Cir. 1995) (โ[a]lthough\nmotions for reconsideration or rehearing are typi cally treated as F ED. R. CIV. P. 59(e)\nmotions, motions for reconsideration or rehearing served more than [28] days after the\njudgment are generally decided under Rule 60(b)โ);s ee also Demahy v. Schwarz Pharma,\nInc., 702 F.3d 177, 182 n. 2 (5th Cir. 2 012) (depending on the time of filing, a motion to\nreconsider โis evaluated either as a motion to โalter or amend a judgmentโ under Rule 59(e)\nor as a motion for โrelief from a final judgment, order, or proceedingโ under Rule60(b)โ). \nA Rule 59(e) motion calls into question the corre ctness of a judgment.   In re\nTranstexas Gas Corp., 303 F.3d 571, 581 (5th Cir. 2002).  โA motion to alter or amend the\njudgment under Rule 59(e) must clearly establish either a manifest error of law or fact or\nmust present newly discovered  evidence and cannot be used to raise arguments which\n3\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 206   Filed 07/15/13   Page 4 of 7\ncould, and should, have been made  before the judgment issued.โ Schiller v. Physicians\nResource Group Inc., 342 F.3d 563, 567 (5th Cir. 2003) (citations and internal quotations\nomitted).  In deciding motions under Rule 59(e), the Court considers the following: \n(1)  whether t he m ovant d emonstrates the motion  is\nnecessary to correct manifest errors of law or fact upon\nwhich the judgment is based; \n(2)  whether the movant presents new evidence; \n(3)  whether the motion is necessary in ord er to prevent\nmanifest injustice; and \n(4)  whether the motion is justified by an interveningch  ange\nin the controlling law. \nCastrillo, 2010 WL 1424398, at *4.  โA Rule 59(e) motion should not be used to relitigate\nprior matters that should have been urged earlier or that simply have been resolved to the\nmovant's dissatisfaction.โ SPE FO Holdings, LLC v. Retif Oil & Fuel, LLC, No. 07โ3779,\n2008 WL 3285907, at *3 (E.D. La. Aug. 6, 2008). โA district court has considerable\ndiscretion to grant or deny a motoin for new trial under Rule 59.โK elly v. Bayou Fleet, Inc,.\nNo. 06โ6871, 2007 WL 3275200, at *1 (E.D. La. Nov. 6, 2007). \nA Rule 60(b) motion also calls into question the correctness of a judgment.  Under\nRule 60(b), the Court may โreileve a party from a final judgmentโ for one of six enumerated\nreasons:\n(1)  mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; \n(2)  newly discovered eviden ce that, with  reasonable\ndiligence, could not have been di scovered in time to\nmove for a new trial under Rule 59(b); \n(3)  fraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic),\nmisrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing paryt; \n4\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 206   Filed 07/15/13   Page 5 of 7\n(4)  the judgment is void; \n(5)  the judgment has been satisifed, released or discharged;\nit is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed\nor vacated; or applying it  prospectively is no  longer\nequitable; or \n(6)  any other reason that justifies relief. \nFED. R. CIV. P. 60(b).  The district court enjoys broad discretion in assessing whether any\nof these reasons are present in a given caseT.  eal v. Eagle Fleet, Inc., 933 F.2d 341, 347 (5th\nCir. 1991).  All Rule 60(b) motions must  be brought within a โreasonable time โ after\njudgment, and motions brought pursuant Rule 60(b)(1), (2), and (3) must be brought\nwithin one year of the judgment or order. F ED. R. CIV. P. 60(c);  see also Steverson v.\nGlobalSantaFe Corp., 508 F.3d 300, 305 (5th Cir. 2007).\nANALYSIS\nThe  David P laintiffsโ motion to reconsider,  while purporting to seek timely\nreconsideration under Rule 59(e) of the Courtโs June 11, 2013 order regarding Signalโs\nmotion to sever, appears in actuality to seek reconsideration of a decision made by Judge\nZainey in March 2012, which motion would properly be governed by Rule 60(b).  Indeed,\nseveral of the arguments raised in the instant motion to reconsider were rai sed by the\nDavid Plaintiffs in their proposed case management submission to Judge Zainey last year. \nThe Court need not dwell on this timing issue, however, because theD  avid Plaintiffs have\nnot demonstrated that reconsideration of  Judge Zaineyโs case management plan is\nappropriate under either Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b).  \nCase management decisions rest squarely within the discretion of the district cour.t \nSee, e.g., Ctr. for Biological Diversity, Inc .v. BP Am. Prod. Co., 704 F.3d 413, 432 (5th Cir.\n5\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 206   Filed 07/15/13   Page 6 of 7\n2013).  In fact, in the only case cited by the David Plaintiffs on this issue, In re Chevron\nU.S.A., Inc., 109 F.3d 1016 (5th Cir.  1997), the Fifth Circuit stated that while it did not\nnecessarily approve of the district courtโs csae management plan, it was nevertheless loathe\nto disturb the district courtโs discretionary determination as to an  appropr iate case\nmanagement plan and the appropriate procedure for and use of an initial trial involving\nonly the claims of a sampling ofp laintiffs from a larger group. I d. at 1018.  The Fifth Circuit\nwent on to caution, however, that โbefore a tiral court may utilize results from a bellwether\ntrial for a purpose that extends beyond the individual cases tried,  it must, prior to any\nextrapolation, find that the cases tried are representative of the larger group of cases or\nclaims from which they are selected.โ  Id. at 1020. \nThe first trial in this case, while it will have obvious ramifications for the case as a\nwhole, is not a โbellwetherโ trial.  The Court does not intend the results of the first trial in\nthis case to be extrapolated to later trials.  Nor does the Court intend the juryโs findings as\nto the plaintiffs in the first trial to apply to anyone but thosep articular plaintiffs. The Court\nalso notes that neither the David Plaintiffs nor Signal intend for the first trial to have a\nbinding effect on the later trials or for the results of the first trial to be extrapolated in any\nway. The Fifth Circuitโs cautionary statements  about the preclusive effect of bellwether\ntrials does not control the Courtโs discretionary case management decisions in this case.\nNot only is the David Plaintiffsโ attempt to relitigate this issue by way of motion to\nreconsider inappropriate, they also have  not established that Judge Zaineyโs case\nmanagement plan will result in manifest injustice.  The Court, in its discretion, denies the\nDavid Plaintiffsโ motion to reconsider.\nAccordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the David Plaintiffsโ motion to reconsider be\n6\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 206   Filed 07/15/13   Page 7 of 7\nand hereby is DENIED.  Judge Zaineyโs case management plan remains in effect, as does\nthis Courtโs ruling on Signalโs motion to sever.\nNew Orleans, Louisiana, this 1_5_th_ day of July, 2013.\n_____________________________\n       SUSIE MORGAN\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\nCourt to Notify:\nMagistrate Judge Daniel E.

Signal\nInternational (Civil Action No. 12-557) (โEEOCโ)\nORDER AND REASONS\nBefore the Court is defendant Signal International, LLC's (\"Signal\") โPartial Motion\nfor Dismissal for Failure to State a Claim Upon Which Relief Can Be Granted.โ1  Plaintiffs-\nIntervenors (\"the Intervenors\") oppose Signal's motion.2  Signal also has filed a reply i n\nfurther support of its motion to dismiss. 3 For the following reasons, the motion is\nGRANTED. \n1 R. Doc. 184.\n2 R. Doc. 188.\n3 R. Doc. 191.\n1\n\nBACKGROUND\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the \"EEOC\") filed a complaint\nagainst Signal for various violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"4).\nThe Intervenors, a group of Signal's former employees, filed a complaint in intervention,\nseeking prospective relief under 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-5(g) and compensatory damages for\npecuniary and non-pecuniary losses.5  The Intervenors also inculded a claim against Signal\nfor recruitment fees (the \"Recruitment Cla im\") they paid to Michael Pol, d/b/a Global\nResources, Inc. (\"Pol\"), Malvern C. Burntet d/b/a Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, LLC\n(\"Burnett\"), and Sachin Dewan d/b/a Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd (\"Dewan\") (Pol, Burnett,\nand Dewan collectively referre d to as the \"Recruiters\"). 6 The Intervenors' amended\ncomplaint added nine (9) additional plaintiff-intervenors in their action against Signal but\nincluded the same prayer for recruitment fees as the original complaint. 7 \nThe Intervenors seek recover y of the recruitment fees they incurred because o f\nSignal's discriminatory practices in violation of Title VII which they say are recoverable\nunder 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981a(a)(1). Signal moves to dismiss theI ntervenors' Recruitment Claim\narguing that (1) 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981a(a)(1) does not provide judicial relief for the Recruitment\nClaim; (2) Intervenors failed to exhaust their administrative remedies with regards to the\n4R. Doc. 1. \n5R. Doc. 45. Although the Intervenors' complaint does not explicitly address the statute, the only\navenue available for the Intervenors to recover these damages for employment discrimination under Title\nVII is through 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981a. \n6R. Doc. 45. \n7R. Doc. 179\n2\n\nRecruitment Claim; and (3) Title VII does not apply extraterritorially.8\nANALYSIS\nI. Waiver and Timeliness of Signal's 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss\nInitially, the Intervenors argue Signal's 12(b)(6) motion is untimely because Signal\nfailed to raise this defense in response to the Intervenor's original complaint. They argue \nthe grounds for Signal's 12(b)(6) motion exis ted in the original  complaint and Signal's\nability to bring the motion was not \"re vived\" merely because the Intervenors filed an\namended complaint. See In re Morrison, 421 B.R. 381, 386 (Bankr. S.D. Tex. 2009). The\nIntervenors argue that the amended complaintd id not create a new basis for their 12(b)(6)\nmotion, therefore Signal should have raised the defense in a motion to dismiss the original\ncomplaint. Id. \nIt is true that under Federal Rule of Civl iProcedure Rule 12(b) a defendant asserting\na 12(b) defense must do so before filing an answer. See Russell v. Choicepoint Servs. Inc.,\n302 F.Supp. 2d 654 (E.D. La. 2003). But Signarle sponds that its 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss\ntargets the Intervenor's First Amende d Complaint, a pleading that Signal has not yet\nanswered.9 \nThe Court need not decide whether the filing of the amended complaint provided\nanother opportunity fo r Signal to file a 12 (b)(6) motion because, even if Plaintiffs-\nIntervenors amended complaint did not create a new basis for Signal to lodge its 12(b)(6)\nmotion, Signal's ability to raise failure to  state a claim as a defense has not been lost.\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(h)(2) allows ap arty to raise the defense of failure to state\n8R. Doc. 184.\n9R. Doc. 184-1, p. 1. \n3\n\na claim by a  motion for judgment on  the pleadings under Rule 12(c). F ED. R. CIV. P.\n12(h)(2).  A Rule 12(c) motion for judgmento n the pleadings may be made after an answer\nhas been filed. FED. R. CIV. P. 12(c). If Signal's 12(b)(6) motion was waived because it was\nnot filed in response to Intervenors' original complaint, the Court may nevertheless treat\nthe motion as a 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings for failure to state a claim for\nwhich relief may be granted. See Jones v. Greninger, 188 F.3d 322, 324 (5th Cir. 1999).\nII. Standard of Law\nWhether Signal's motion is treated as a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss or as a Rule\n12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings does not change the legal standard the Court\nmust apply. The standard for dismissal under Rule 12(c) is the same as that for dismissal\nfor failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6)J. ohnson v. Johnson, 385 F.3d 503, 528 (5th\nCir. 2004).  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a district court may\ndismiss a complaint, or any part of it, for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be\ngranted if the plaintiff has not set forth factuaall legations in support of his claim that would\nentitle him to relief.  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007);  Cuvillier v.\nTaylor, 503 F.3d 397, 401 (5th Cir. 2007).  As the Fifth Circuit expla ined in Gonzales v.\nKay:\n\"Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the\nspeculative level.\" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127\nS.Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). The Supreme Court recently\nexpounded upon the Twombly standard, explaining that \"[t]o survive\na motion to dismi ss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual\nmatter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on\nits face.\" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 128 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173\nL.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct.\n1955, 167 L.Ed.2d  929). \"A Claim has facial plausibility when the\nplaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the\nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct\n4\n\nalleged.\" Id. It follows that \"where the well-pleaded fact dso not permit\nthe court to infer more than the mere po ssibility of misconduct, the\ncomplaint has alleged - but it has not 'show[n]' - that the pleader is\nentitled to relief.\" Id. at 1950 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). \n577 F.3d 600, 603 (5th Cir. 2009). \nThe Court cannot look beyond the factual allegations in the pleadings to determine\nwhether relief should be granted.  See Spivey v. Robertson, 197 F.3d 772, 774 (5th Cir.\n1999); Baker v. Putnal, 75 F.3d 190, 196 (5th Cir. 1996). In assessing the Intervenors'\ncomplaint, the Court must accept all well-pleaded facts as true and liberally construe all\nfactual allegations in the light most favorable to the Intervenors. Spivey, 197 F.3d at 774;\nLowrey v. Tex A & M Univ. Sys, .117 F.3d 242, 247 (5th Cir. 1997). \"Dismissal is appropriate\nwhen the complaint 'on its face show[s] a bar to relief.\" Cutrer v. McMillan, 308 F. App'x\n819, 820 (5th Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (unpublished) (quoting Clark v. Amoco Prod. Co.,\n794 F.2d 967, 970 (5th Cir. 1986)).  A court may grant a motion f or judgment on the\npleadings when no genuine issues of material fact remain and the case can be decided as\na matter of law.  Erickson v. Pardus, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007).\nIII. Extraterritorial Application of Title VII\nSignal moves to dismiss the Intervenors' Recuitment Claim because Title VII does\nnot apply extraterritorially. 10 Intervenors in response argue that the  extraterriorial\napplication of Title VII is not required because the Intervenors worked at Signal's facilities\nin the United States.11 Signal concedes, and this Court agrees, that the Intervenors' other\nTitle VII claims based on conditions within theU  nited States present no extraterritoriality\n10R. Doc. 184, p. 8. \n11R. Doc. \n5\n\nissues.12 On the other hand, the alleged discriminatory conduct in connection with the\nRecruitment Claim relates to events outside of  the United States before the Intervenors\nbegan work at Signal's facilities. \nThe Court must acknowledge the \"longsta nding principle of American law 'that\nlegislation of Congress, unless contrary intent appears, is meant to apply only within the\nterritorial jurisdiction of the United States.\" EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U.S.\n244, 248 (1991) (quoting  Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo , 336 U.S. 281, 285 (19 49)). This\nimportant principle \"serves to protect against unintended clashes between our laws and\nthose of other nations which could result in international discord.\"  Id. Thus, the\npresumption against extraterritorial application of a federal statute can be overcome only\nif there is an \"affirmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed.\"I d. (quoting Benz v.\nCompania Naviera Hidalgo, S.A., 353 U.S. 138, 147 (1957)). Because this determination\nis \"a matter of statutory construction,\"A  rabian, 499 U.S. at 248, theC  ourt begins with the\ntext of Title VII. \nSection 2000e(f) of Title VII provides that\" with respect to employment in a foreign\ncountry, such term [employee] includes an indviidual who is a citizeno f the United States.\"\n42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e(f). Further, section 2000e-1(a) states that Title VII \"shall not apply to\nan employer with respect to the employment of aliens outside any State.\" 42 U.S.C . ยง\n2000e-1(a); See Iwata v. Stryker Corp., 59 F.Supp. 2d 600, 603 (N.D. Tex. 1999). Read\ntogether, the two statutes show Congress' inteniton to exclude non-citizens located outside\nof the United States from the protection of Title VII. See id. at 604. However, non-citizens \nare covered by the statute if they are working in the United States. See Espinoza v. Farah\n12R. Doc. 184, p. 10. \n6\n\nMfg. Co., 414 U.S. 86, 95 (1973).  \nIn the case before the Court, it is  undisputed that the Intervenors paid all\nrecruitment fees prior to their arrival in the United States. Signal's alleged discriminatory\nacts, requiring the Intervenors to pay high er recruitment fees than other non-India n\nworkers, occurred before the Intervenors came to the United States1.3 Under a plain reading\nof section  2000e(f) and section 2000e-1(a), the Intervenors were not covered by Title VII\nwhen they paid the  recruitment fees because  they were non-citizens and they were not\nworking within the United States at the time . \"It is clear from the plain language of 42\nU.S.C. ยง 2000e(f) and 42 U.S.C . ยง 2000e-1(a) that Congress inte ntionally excluded\nindividuals such as Plaintiffs from the protections of Title VII.\"I wata v. Stryker Corp., 59\nF. Supp. 2d 600, 604 (N.D. Tex. 1999). Further, based on the language of Title VII, there\nis no \"affirmative intention of Congress clearly expressed t\"o cover the recruitment fees that\ndefeats the presumption against extraterritorial application of the statuteE. EOC v. Arabian\nAmerican Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 248  (quoting Benz v. Compania Naviera Hidalgo, S.A.,\n353 U.S. 138, 147 (1957)).\nThe Intervenors argue that an analysis of Title VI'Is extraterritorial application is not\nrequired because the Intervenors eventually worked in the United States1.4 The Intervenors\nurge that they were employedw  ithin the United States underb  oth of the tests courts apply\nto determine the location of an individual's employment. Gomez v. Honeywell Int'l, Inc.,\n510 F. Supp. 2d 417, 421-24 (W. D. Tex. 2007) (explaining the \"center of gravity\" test and\n13R.Doc. 179. The Court notes that four of the twelve Intervenors paid recruitment fees prior to\nSignal's involvement in seeking foreign employees to work at its facilities to work in the United States.\n14R. Doc. 188\n7\n\nthe \"primary work station test\" used to  determine whether the  plaintiff-employee was\nemployed in the United States);  Shekoyan v. Sibley Int'l Corp., 217 F. Supp. 2d 59, 68\n(D.D.C. 2002). Regardless of which test Intervenors urge the Court t oapply, their argument\nmisses the mark. The Intervenors cann ot recover under Title VII for their Recruitment\nClaim because ofw  hen the claims arose, notw  here the Intervenors eventually worked. The\nCourt notes that the Intervenors may have valdi  claims against Signal for acts occurring in\nthe United States after the Intervenors arrived. However, the Recruitment Claim is based\non events before the Intervenors arrived in the United State,s for acts occurring beyond this\ncountry's borders and the reach of Title VII. \nThe most illustrative case involving a discrimination claim based on events prior to\nthe plaintiff-employee's arrival to the United States isR eyes-Gaona v. N.C. Growers Ass'n,\n250 F.3d 861 (4 th Cir. 2001). In  Reyes, the plaintiff sued an American corporation for\nviolations under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). Id. Although Reyes\ndoes not involve a suit under Ttile VII, the ADEA has almosti dentical provisions regarding\nthe application of the statute to non-citizens abroad. 15 The plaintiff, a Mexican resident,\napplied for a job in North Carolina.  Id. at 865. However, the en tire application process\noccurred in Mexico  and the plaintiff's calim was based on events in Mexico.I d. at 863. The\nFourth Circuit held that the planitiff was not entitled to bring a suit under the ADEA simply\nbecause the future place of employment was located within the United States. Id. at 866.\nThe court found that the plaintiff was a  non-citizen who was not employed within the\nUnited States, which prevented her from having a claim under the ADEA. Id.  \n15 Title VII and the ADEA's \"provisions defining 'employee' and outlining foreign employment are\nvirtually identical.\" Iwata, 59 F.Supp. 2d at 604. \n8\n\nSimilarly, the Intervenors were not citize ns and they were not employed in the\nUnited States when their Recruitment Claim aroes.  A plain reading oft he text of the statute\ncompels the conclusion that the Intervenors' Recruitment Claim is not viable under Title\nVII, and therefore compensatory damages cannotb e recovered on this claim under ยง 1981a. \nIV. Exhaustion of Remedies\nThe Court need not reach the issue raised in Signal's motion regarding exhaustion\nof remedies. Regardless of whether the Interevnors properly exhausted their administrative\nremedies r egarding the Recruitment Claim,  the claim for recruitment fees must be\ndismissed for the reasons stated above. \nThe Court also notes that when deciding motions to dismiss under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 12(c), it must limit its a nalysis to the facts alleged in the pleadings.  See\nCollins v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, 224 F.3d 496, 498 (5th Cir. 2000). In its motion,\nSignal attached several exhibits to support its arguments surrounding the exhaustion of\nadministrative remedies.16 When a court considers inform ation outside the pleadings, a\nmotion to dismiss is converted into a motion for summary judgment under Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 56. See Clark v. Tarrant Cnty., Tex., 798 F.2d 736, 745 (5th Cir. 1986).\nIn deciding the present motion, the Court  did not consider any matters outsi de of the\npleadings. All of the attached exhibits re lated to Signa l's arguments concerning the\nIntervenors' failure to exhaust administrati ve remedies, an issue the Court does not\naddress. Therefore, Signal's motion is not treated as a motion for summary judgment. \nCONCLUSION\nSignal's motion to dismiss is timely and Signal's defense of failure to state a claim\n16R. Doc. 184. Signal attached Exhibit \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" and \"D\" to its motion to dismiss. \n9\n\nfor which relief can be granted is not waiv ed. The Intervenor's Recruitment Claim for\ncompensatory damages under ยง1981a(a)(1) is not recoverable under Title VII. At the time\nthe basis for the Intervenor's claim arose, the Intervenors were not \"employees\" as defined\nby Title VII because they were aliens outside the United States. Accordingly, Signal's motion\nto dismiss the Recruitment Claim is GRANTED.\nNew Orleans, Louisiana, this 2_6_t_h day of September, 2013.\n_____________________________\n       SUSIE MORGAN\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\nCourt to Notify:\nMagistrate Judge Daniel E.

See R.

Signal argues the recruitment fees are not recoverable because (1) 42 ยง U.S.C. 1981a\ndoes not provide judicial relief i n the form of recovery of the recruitment fees; 15 (2) the\nplaintiffs-intervenors failed to exhaust their administrative remedies with respect  to the\nrecruitment fees; and (3) the recruitment fee claim arises out of events occurring abroad\nand Title VII does not apply extraterritorially.16\nThe Court granted Signal's motion for partial dismissal on September 26, 2013. 17\nTreating Signal's motion as a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 12(c), the Court found the basis for plaintiffs-intervenors discrimination\nclaim against Signal for recruitment fees arose before they were employees as defined by\nTitle VII because they were aliens outside the United States when they incurred the fees.18\nThe Court declined to apply Title VII extrat erritorially and dismissed the plaintiffs-\n14R. Doc. 188.\n15Signal argued 42 U.S.C. ยง1981a did not provide recovery because subsection 1981a(b)(3), which\ndescribes the cap on recovery, lists \"future pecuniary losses\" and not \"past pecuniary losses\" as\ncompensatory damages. Signal urged the omission in the statute showed that past pecuniary losses are not\nrecoverable. \n16R. Doc. 184. \n17R. Doc. 251. \n18R.

See, e.g. Castrillo v. Am. Home Mortg.\nServicing, Inc., No. 09-4369, 2010 WL 1424398, at *3-4 (E.D. La. Apr. 5, 2010) (\"The\ngeneral practice of this court has been to  evaluate motions to reconsider interlocutory\norders under the same standards that govern Rule 59(e) motions to alter or amend a final\njudgment.\")23 \n19R. Doc. 251, p. 9. The Court did not reach the issue of whether or not the plaintiffs-intervenors\nfailed to exhaust their administrative remedies. The Court noted Signal attached exhibits to support its\narguments surrounding the exhaustion of administrative remedies. Because the Court did not consider\nthose exhibits, it did not covert Signal's motion to a motion for summary judgment. Additionally, the\nCourt did not consider Signal's argument that ยง 1981a only applies to future pecuniary losses. \n20R. Doc. 273. \n21R. Doc. 273, pp. 4-7. \n22R. Doc. 273, pp. 7-19. \n23A Rule 59(e) motion must be filed within twenty-eight days of the entry of judgment. See Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 54(b). A motion to reconsider filed outside this 28-day window is evaluated under the standards\ngoverning a motion for relief from final judgment under Rule 60(b). Stangel v.

Because the plaintiffs-intervenors motion was timely filed within the 28-day window, it\nis properly treated as a Rule 59(e) motion. \n6\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 336   Filed 01/15/14   Page 7 of 9\n\"[i]mplicit in the Court's decision is the ho lding that Title VI I does not apply to the\nrecruitment and hiring process.\" 24 Specifically, plaintiffs-intervenors take issue with a\nsingle sentence of this Courts' order, which stated, \"[t]he Intervenors cannot recover under\nTitle VII for their Recruitment Claim b ecause of when the claims arose, not  where the\n[plaintiffs-intervenors] eventually worked.\" 25 Plaintiffs-interveno rs argue the Court\ncommitted legal error because this sentence creates a bright line rule preventing Title VII\nfrom applying to all activities occurring during the hiring process. \nThe plaintiffs-intervenors' reading of the Court's order is overly broad. The Court did\nnot rule that there may never be recovery under Title VII for actions occurring during the\nhiring process. When Title VII is applicable , it clearly prohibit s unlawful employment\npractices during the hiring process.26 Instead, the Court highlighted when the claim for the\nrecruitment fees arose (while the plaintiffs-ni tervenors, non-U.S. citizens, were abroad) to\ndemonstrate why applying the statute in this case would have required an extraterritorial\napplication of Title VII.   \nSecond, the plaintiffs-intervenors argue the Court erred as a matter of law in its\nSeptember 26, 2013 Order by reading \"Title VIIin   a radical way to judicially legislate a safe\n24R.

See 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(a)(2) (\"Section 703\")(\"It\nshall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any\nindividual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms,\nconditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex or national\norigin; or to limit, segregate, or (2) classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which\nwould deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect\nhis status as an employee, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\")\n7\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 336   Filed 01/15/14   Page 8 of 9\nharbor from Title VII for any discrimination with a foreign compo nent.\"27 Again, the\nplaintiffs-intervenors have misrepresented the Court's ruling, which is limited to the facts\nof this case and creates no safe harbor for discrimination with a foreign component.  \nIt is important to remember that the dismissed claim is a Title VII discrimination\nclaim for recruitment fees  incurred by non-U.S. citizens, while they were outside this\ncountry, and paid to the non-defendant Recruiter srather than to the defendant Signal.  The\nplaintiffs-intervenors have not presented any new evidence or pointed to any intervening\nchange in controlling law.  Neither have they cited to any case squarely on point reaching\na conclusion different from this Court. The pl aintiff-intervenors have failed to clearly\nestablish a manifest error of law or to show taht granting the motion is necessary to prevent\nmanifest injustice.  The requirements of  Rule 59(e) have not been met a nd the Court\ndeclines to reconsider its Order granting Signal's Motion for Partial Dismissal.28\n27Doc. 273-1, p. 4.\n28The Court does note that, even if exterritorial application of Title VII is not required, it is\ndoubtful that the allegations of the complaint in intervention for recovery of recruitment fees from Signal\nwould state a claim for relief that is plausible and capable of surviving a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss\nunder Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly. 550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 919 (2007) and Ashcroft v.\nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 139 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). To make out a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination under Title VII, a plaintiff to show he was (1) a member of a protected class; (2) qualified\nfor the position held; (3) subject to an adverse employment action; and (4) treated differently from others\nsimilarly situated. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668\n(1973). In the Fifth Circuit, an \"adverse employment action for Title VII discrimination claims ...\n'include[s] only ultimate employment decisions such as hiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, or\ncompensating.\" McCoy v. City of Shreveport 492 F.3d 551, 559 (5th Cir. 2007), quoting Green v.\nAdministrators of Tulane Educ.

Ct. 336 (1997). To state an actionable\ndiscrimination claim under Title VII, the plaintiffs-intervenors' claim for recruitment fees must be based\non a \"tangible employment action [that] constitutes a significant change in employment status, such as\nhiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision\ncausing a significant change in benefits.\" Burlington Indus., Inc. v.

For each Trust Claim Form that is submitted, the Trustee shall determine \nwhether the claim described therein meets the eligibility requirements of Sections 4.1  of this \nTDP and the eligibility requirements for  each component of such holder's Litigation Claims \nidentified in the Trust Claim Form as set forth in Section 4.3 of this TDP.  The Trustee shall \nallow submitted Litigation Claims that satisfy all eligibility criteria applicable to such Litigation \nClaim, provided, however, that, if the eligibility requirements of Section 4.1  of this TDP are \notherwise met, the Trustee shall only allow those .c laim components identified on the Trust \nClaim Form that meet the eligibility requirements of the subsection of Section 4.3 applicable to \nsuch claim. \nIf a Litigation Claimant submits an incomplete or deficient claim, e.g., the claimant failed \nto include required documentation or failed to sign the Trust Claim Form, the Trustee shall send \na deficiency notice to such Litigation Claimant and the Trustee shall informally and reasonably \nwork  with  that  claimant in  an  effort to  cure  any  such  deficiencies.  Litigation  Claimants \nsubmitting incomplete or deficient claims shall have thirty (30) days to cure a deficiency, and \nany Litigation Claim that continues to be incomplete or deficient after that thirty (30)-day cure \nperiod shall be disallowed, provided, however, that, if the eligibility requirements of Section 4.1 \nof this TDP are otherwise met, the Trustee shall only disallow claim components identified on \nthe Trust Claim Form that continue to be incomplete or deficient after the thirty (30)-day cure \nperiod. \nIf the holder of a disallowed Litigation Claim wishes to dispute the disallowance of such \nclaim  pursuant to  Section  5.1  or this  Section  5.2,  such  holder  may  file  a motion  in the \nNY\\7387605.2 \n\nCase 15-11498-MFW    Doc 555-1    Filed 11/24/15    Page 31 of 35\nBankruptcy Court seeking an  order resolving that  dispute  (a \"Dispute Resolution Motion\") \nwithin fourteen  14  days  of receiving  a disallowance  notice from  the  Trust.  Any Dispute \nResolution Motion should be served on the Trustee as required by Rule 9006-1  of the Local \nRules for the United States Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware.ยท For the avoidance of any \ndoubt, the sole remedies that may be sought by a Dispute Resolution Motion are (i) allowance of \nthe asserted Litigation Claim,  or,  (ii)  subject to  adequate demonstration of a non-frivolous, \ncognizable,  non-time-barred  claim,  authorization  to  file  a  lawsuit  against  the  Litigation \nSettlement Trust in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana or the \nEastern District of Texas.  Following the final allowance of the asserted Litigation Claim by the \nBankruptcy Court, or by a court of competent jurisdiction, such Litigation Claim shall be subject \nto the applicable treatment provided in this TDP. \nOnce the Trustee has  completed review and processing of the submitted Trust Claim \nForms, the Trustee will maintain records with the name of every Litigation Claimant, the claim \nor claims for which he seeks compensation, the evidence submitted in support of the claim or \nclaims, and which claim or claims was/were allowed or disallowed. \n5.3  Nominal Claim Values.

A Holder of an allowed Litigation Claim shall be \nentitled to receive his Pro Rata Trust Share (as defined below) of the Litigation Claim \nPayment Fund distributed by the Trustee. The \"Pro Rata Trust Share\" shall mean the \nproportion, expressed as a percentage, that the total of the Nominal Claim Values of all \nallowed Litigation Claim components held by a given Litigation Claimant bears to the \naggregate  of all  Nominal  Claim  Values  for  all  allowed  Litigation  Claims.

The Trustee shall distribute payments to Holders of \nallowed Litigation Claims within fourteen (14) days after the review and allowance or \ndisallowance of all timely-submitted Trust Claim Forms has been completed on a final \nbasis;  provided,  however,  that  to  the  extent  that  the  total  Val\\le  of the  Litigation \nSettlement Trust Assets has not yet been received by the Trust such that the Litigation \nNY\\7387605.2 \n\nCase 15-11498-MFW    Doc 555-1    Filed 11/24/15    Page 35 of 35\nClaim Payment Fund is not yet  fully  funded,  i.e., because certain of the underlying \nLitigation Settlement Trust Assets consist of amounts that may be paid incrementally \nover time, the Trust shall make an initial distribution based on the amount then-currently \nheld in the Litigation Claim Payment Fund.  The Trust, in consultation with the TAC, \nshall make additional distributions to Holders of allowed Litigation Claims as and when \nadditional funds are received by the Litigation Settlement Trust in amounts sufficient to \nmake a distribution practicable, until such time as the total value of Litigation Settlement \nTrust Assets has been received by the Trust and distributed on a pro rata basis to all \nholders  of allowed  Litigation Claims,  excluding portions set  aside for  the Trustee's \nexpenses as set forth in the Litigation Trust Agreement. \nSection VI \nMISCELLANEOUS \n6.1  Amendments.  The Trustee, with notice to the Litigation Settlement TAC, may \namend, modif'y, delete, or add to any provision of this TDP, other than Section 5.3, which may \nnot be amended, modified, or deleted, other than as set forth in Section 6.2, below. \n6.2  Severability.  Should  any  provision  in  this  TDP  be  determined  to  be \nunenforceable, such determination shall in no way limit or affect the enforceability and operative \neffect of any and all other provisions of this TDP, provided, however, that to the extent that \nSection  5.3  is  held to  be unenforceable,  then  the Trustee,  Litigation  Settlement TAC,  and \nrepresentatives of holders of Litigation Claims, along with any holders of Litigation Claims that \nsubmitted Proofs of Claim in the Bankruptcy Cases but who are not represented by counsel, shall \nmeet and confer and reach agreement on revisions to Section, 5.3, as  applicable, that would \nrender that Section (or those Sections) enforceable. \n6.3  Governing Law.

Defendant,  in t he a ftermath of  H urricane K atrina,  was una ble t o o btain a  \nsufficient number of qualified and reliable pipe fitters and welders to meet the demands of its \nwork load. \n9.  Defendant, to meet this need, arranged to bring into the United States over 500 \nIndian m en t hrough t he f ederal  governmentโs H -2B  guestworker p rogram.  T hese  Indian \nEmployees were hired by Defendant to provide labor and services at its Pascagoula, Mississippi, \nand Orange, Texas, locations. \n10.  The first workers arrived in the end of October, 2006. Additional workers came \nover in waves of 30 to 50 workers until on or about March, 2007. \n11.  Defendant brought over more than 500 Indian employees, sending some of these \nworkers to its facility in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and others to its facility in Orange, Texas. \n12.  At each location the Indian Employees were required to live in modular trailers \ncalled โman camps.โ   The โm an cam psโ w ere bui lt f or t he ex clusive us e of  t he  Indian \nEmployees.

These agreements were written in English, \nand Defendant di d not   give t he  Indian workers adequate t ime t o read or understand t hese \ndocuments. \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Docum  e  nt 153   Filed 08/08/12   Page 5 of 16\n14.  One of these agreements allowed Defendant to deduct $35 a day (or $1050 per \nmonth) from each Indian workerโs earnings to reimburse Defendant for the cost of providing \nfood, accommodations, and transportation for each such Indian Employee.  Under this agreement \nDefendant could continue to deduct this amount from the workerโs salary even if the Indian \nEmployee e lected not   to e at t he m eals pr ovided b y D efendant  and not  t o l ive i n t he \naccommodations provided by Defendant. \n15.  The โman campsโ were located on Signal property in isolated, industrial areas \nmiles removed from shopping areas, places of worship, and residential communities.  The camps \nwere enclosed by fences and accessible only through a single guarded entrance.  \n16.  Signal assigned numbers to each Indian Employee and used these numbers as a \nform of identification and reference rather than using the employeeโs name. \n17.  Signal camp personnel and supervisors used offensive language in speaking with \nand/or referring to the Indian Employees and insulted the Indian Employees on the basis of their \nrace and/or national origin.   \n18.  Signal guards monitored the comings and goings of the Indian Employees by \nrequiring them to show their employee identification badges.  Signal guards also searched the \npackages and bags of Indian Employees when they entered the camps. \n19.  Except on  rare occasions, the Indian Employees were not permitted to receive \nvisitors in the โman camps.โ \n20.  The โman campsโ were composed of a series of one room trailers connected by \nelevated walkways.  Most of the trailers were for sleeping and were referred to as โbunkhouses.โ  \nUp to twenty-four men were housed in each bunkhouse, sleeping in two-tiered bunk beds.  The \nbunk beds were so tightly packed in the bunkhouses that it was difficult for the workers to move \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Docum  e  nt 153   Filed 08/08/12   Page 6 of 16\nabout in the narrow passageways between bunks. \n21.  The bunkhouses had insufficient toileting and bathing facilities for the twenty-\nfour men.  The Indian Employees were forced to rise early to take their place in line for the few \ntoilets and showers in each trailer. \n22.  Privacy  was non -existent f or t he  Indian  Employees. T he  Indian E mployees \nexperienced  extreme di fficulty s leeping du e t o t he cons tant noi se  resulting f rom t he  close \nquarters and the comings and goings of workers who worked on different shifts. \n22.  Signal pe rsonnel c onducted s urprise s earches  of t he bunkhous es, i ncluding \nsearching of workerโs personal belongings. \n23.  The Indian Employees took their meals in mess halls which were part of the โman \ncamps.โ  The mess halls were only open during limited hours, set by Signal.  The food provided \nby Signal was of poor quality and was frequently bad, stale or molded.  \n24.  As a result of unsanitary conditions, sickness was rampant in the camps, and the \nIndian Employees sometimes required hospitalization.  \n25.  The โman campsโ had rules, enforced by Signal guards. The penalty for breaking \nrules was $250 for the first violation and $500 for a second violation. \n26.  When t he Indian E mployees c omplained a nd a sked t o l ive out side the l abor \ncamps, Defendant Signal told the workers that even if they lived outside the camps, Signal would \ncontinue to deduct the $35/day charge from the Indian Employeeโs weekly wage.  As a result, the \nIndian Employees reasonably felt that they had no choice but to continue to live in the Signal \nโman camps.โ \n27.  During the first two weeks of employing each Indian Employee, Defendant Signal \nalso deducted between $100 a nd $200 a  week from each employeeโs paycheck for tool kits \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Docum  e  nt 153   Filed 08/08/12   Page 7 of 16\nwhich the Indian Employees were required to purchase from Defendant Signal. \n28.  Vijayan a nd K adakkarappally r outinely  complained t o S ignal, on be half of  \nthemselves and the other Indian Employees, about the food, living conditions, camp facilities, \ncamp rules, and terms and conditions of employment at Signal. Vijayan and Kadakkarappally \nfrequently met with fellow Indian Employees to learn of their concerns relating to the conditions \nunder which they were forced to work by Signal. \n29.  In response to these complaints, Signal personnel warned the Indian Employees to \nstop complaining. Signal personnel and management regularly threatened the Indian Employees \nthat if they did not continue working for Signal or did not work to Signalโs specifications they \nwould be deported to India. \n30.  After complaining to Signal about the housing, food, and the overall terms and \nconditions of employment, the Indian Employees living in the Pascagoula โman campโ began \nmeeting to discuss how to persuade Defendant to improve the working conditions of the Indian \nEmployees. \n31.  On or  a bout M arch 4, 2007, V ijayan, K adakkarappally, a nd ot her  Indian \nEmployees met with attorneys in a church near the Pascagoula facility. The purpose of this \nmeeting was to discuss their rights as employees of Signal.   \n32.  Signal learned of the aforementioned meeting held on or  about March 4, 2007. \nThe recruiting agent Defendant Signal used in India, Sachin Dewan, called Vijayanโs wife at her \nhome in India and warned her that Vijayan must stop making complaints about Signal or Signal \nwould return the Indian Employees to India.  Vijayanโs wife informed Vijayan of this call.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Docum  e  nt 153   Filed 08/08/12   Page 8 of 16\n33.  Vijayan informed the other Indian Employees about the call which his wife had \nreceived and word spread quickly through the Pascagoula and Orange camps regarding the \nthreats against Vijayan. \n34.  Vijayan and Kadakkarappally took leading roles in gathering information and \nvoicing the complaints of the other Indian Employees to Signal.  \n35.   Defendant Signal called a meeting of the Indian Employees on March 8, 2007.  \nAt this meeting, in the presence of Signalโs legal counsel, Signal management told the Indian \nEmployees that: 1) they were not being mistreated; 2) they were complaining too  much; 3) \nmanagement would only respond to complaints which it considered were legitimate; 4) Signal \nwould fight back against any organizing efforts by the workers; and 5) if the workers brought \nany legal action against Signal, Signal would not extend the Indian employeeโs H-2B visas.   \n36.  The next morning, March 9, 2007, Signal locked the gate to the Pascagoula โman \ncampโ, thereby obstructing the sole means of direct entry to and from the camp.  Signal camp \ncoordinator D arrell S nyder a nd  approximately  five s ecurity  guards t hen s wept t hrough t he \nbunkhouses carrying pictures of Vijayan, Kadakkarappally and other Indian Employees. \n37.  Shortly after 5:00 a.m. on March 9, 2007, S ignal forcibly transported Vijayan, \nKadakkarappally and three other Indian Employees from their bunkhouse to another trailer used \nas a TV room.  Signalโs plan was to keep these employees in the room, to discharge them from \nemployment, and then to transport them to the airport for immediate return to India.  Signalโs \nplan was only altered because Vijayan, en route to the TV room, attempted suicide by cutting his \nwrists. \n38.  On March 9, 2007, Signal discharged Vijayan and Kadakkarappally. \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Docum  e  nt 153   Filed 08/08/12   Page 9 of 16\n39.

This unequal treatment included but was not limited to Indian Employees being \nassigned the most undesirable work which non-Indian employees were not asked to perform and \nother disparate terms and conditions of employment.   \nCOUNT I \n \n[Title VII Hostile Work Environment Based on National Origin/Race] \n41.

Defendant Signal International, LLC (โSignalโ), a major Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas-\nbased rig and ship fabrication and repair company, forced Plaintiffs-Intervenors Sabulal Vijayan, \nJacob Joseph Kadakkarappally, Kurian David, Sony Vasudevan Sulekha, Palanyandi \nThangamani, Muruganantham Kandhasamy, Hemant Khuttan, Padaveettiyil Issac Andrews, \nKechuru Dhananjaya, Krishan Kumar, Kuldeep Singh, and Thanasekar Chellappan (โPlaintiffs-\n \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Docum  e  nt 179   Filed 11/07/12   Page 2 of 21\nIntervenorsโ) and other Indian H-2B workers (collectively, including Plaintiffs-Intervenors, โthe \nIndian Workersโ) to live in overcrowded, unsanitary, and guarded โman campsโ for which these \nworkers paid dearly.  For a 6 foot by 3 foot top or bottom bunk with barely enough headroom to \nsit up in a room shared with as many as 23 other men, which Signal itself acknowledged was not \ncompliant with the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (โOSHAโ), and food \nprepared by an outfit that Signal management said would be shut down if the Health Department \never inspected it, Signal required the Plaintiffs-Intervenors to pay astronomical rent -- $ 1,050 \nper month.  The Plaintiffs-Intervenors, however, also paid with their health, their freedom, and \ntheir livelihoods.     \n2.  Among Signalโs many employees at its two production sites, only the Indian Workers \nwere required to pay these exorbitant rent charges and only the Indian Workers lived in the man \ncamps.  Signal specifically intended the man camps to be for Indian Workers only; segregated \nand isolated to such an extent that visitors โ be they close relatives, friends, language teachers, \nclergy, or legal services providers โ were not allowed to enter the compound.  Indeed, Defendant \nSignal would not have subjected, and did not subject, its non-Indian workforce to these \nconditions. \n3.  Plaintiffs-Intervenors and the other Indian Workers arrived at Signal having paid as much \nas $20,000 to Signalโs labor recruiters and attorney.  To work at Signal, Plaintiffs-Intervenors \nwere required to apply through these specific recruiters and attorney, and therefore they had no \nchoice but to pay these fees.  When some workers sought to come to Signal directly without \ngoing through these recruiters and this attorney, Signal refused to allow them to do so.  For the \nIndian Workers, fees of this size required selling possessions of value, mortgaging futures, and \nentering into desperate debt.  No non-Indian Signal employees were required to use a specific \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Docum  e  nt 179   Filed 11/07/12   Page 3 of 21\nrecruiter, nor did any non-Indian Signal employees arrive at Signal having paid a similarly high \namount of money to any recruiter.  \n4.  Signal also subjected the Plaintiffs-Intervenors and others to abusive treatment based on \ntheir race and/or national origin.  Signal referred to Indian Workers by their Signal employee \nnumbers and not by their names.  Signal supervisors and management used derogatory language \nto demean the Plaintiffs-Intervenors and other Indian Workers, including referring to them as \nโthievesโ and โanimalsโ; telling them to โshut upโ when they raised complaints to Signal; saying \nthat the man camps were better than the Indian Workersโ homes in India; and referring to Indian \nWorkers as โFโฆing Keralite,โ โrat[s],โ โchronic whiners,โ and โback-stabbing whining little \nbitches.โ  This race and national origin based treatment created a hostile work environment for \nthe Plaintiffs-Intervenors and the other Indian Workers.   \n5.  Signal assigned Plaintiffs-Intervenors to the most dangerous, difficult, and dirty jobs on \nthe rigs they were repairing, at times without adequate safety procedures in place.  Plaintiffs-\nIntervenors believe they were assigned to these posts because of their race and national origin \nbecause few non-Indian Workers received such unwanted assignments.   \n6.  Plaintiffs-Intervenors Sabulal Vijayan and Jacob Joseph Kadakkarappally complained to \nSignal management about these unwanted and unhealthful living and working conditions and \ntried to meet with other workers to coordinate a response.  After engaging in these activities, on \nMarch 9, 2007, Signal rounded them up in a public display designed to intimidate the other \nIndian workers, imprisoned Kadakkarappally in a guarded room to await forced deportation, and \nattempted to so detain Vijayan.  Only the attention of the media and the arrival of the local \npolice, along with a gathering of concerned supporters outside Signalโs gates and a suicide \nattempt by Vijayan, who decided he would rather die than be forced to return to his crippling \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Docum  e  nt 179   Filed 11/07/12   Page 4 of 21\ndebt in India, thwarted the deportation.  In all, the March 9 incident โ which Signal itself has \nreferred to as โBlack Fridayโ โ was a flagrant effort to retaliate against Vijayan and \nKadakkarappally for complaining about Signalโs illegal, inhumane, and discriminatory treatment.      \n7.  Plaintiffs-Intervenors therefore join the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \n(โEEOCโ) in this suit to vindicate their rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.   \nJurisdiction and Venue \n8.

At all times relevant to this action, David, Sulekha, Thangamani, Kandhasamy, Khuttan, \nAndrews, Dhananjaya, Kumar, Singh, and Chellappan were similarly situated to Plaintiffs-\nIntervenors Vijayan and Kadakkarappally and to the other Indian Workers. \n28.  Plaintiffs-Intervenors and the other Indian Workers are of Asian race and are Indian \nnationals. \nDefendant \n29.  At all relevant times, Defendant Signal, a Delaware corporation, has been doing business \nin Pascagoula, Mississippi, and in Orange, Texas.  Signal is engaged in the business of building \nand repairing ships and off-shore oil rigs. \n30.  At all relevant times herein, Defendant Signal has continuously been an employer \nengaged in an industry affecting commerce within the meaning of ยง 701(b), (g) and (h) of Title \nVII, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-(b), (g) and (h). \nTHE NATURE OF THE COMPLAINT \n31.  Defendant Signal, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, was unable to obtain a sufficient \nnumber of qualified and reliable pipe fitters and welders to meet the demands of its work load. \n32.  Defendant Signal, to meet this need, arranged to bring into the United States \napproximately 500 Indian men (the Indian Workers) through the federal governmentโs H-2B \nguestworker program.   \n33.  Defendant Signal entered into contracts with United States-based recruiter Michael Pol \nd/b/a Global Resources, Inc. (collectively โPolโ); United States-based attorney Malvern C. \nBurnett d/b/a Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, LLC and Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, \nA.P.C. (collectively โBurnettโ); and India-based recruiter Sachin Dewan d/b/a Dewan \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Docum  e  nt 179   Filed 11/07/12   Page 8 of 21\nConsultants Pvt. Ltd a/k/a Medtech Consultants (collectively โDewanโ) (Pol, Burnett, and \nDewan collectively referred to as โthe Recruitersโ). \n34.  When Defendant Signal entered into a contract with the Recruiters in April 2006, the \nrepresentatives of Signal who executed the contract knew that Signal would not pay any \nrecruitment fee, service charge, transportation expense, visa issuance fee, legal fee, or any other \nfee, expense, charge or money whatsoever to the Recruiters for any part of the recruitment, \nprocessing, arrangement, or transportation of the Indian Workers. \n35.  At that time, the representatives of Signal who executed the contract knew that the Indian \nWorkers themselves would pay these fees, expenses, and charges to the Recruiters.   \n36.  The Indian Workers in fact each paid up to $20,000 U.S. Dollars to the Recruiters.  \nSpecifically, Plaintiff-Intervenor Vijayan paid approximately $12,670, Kadakkarappally paid \napproximately $13,226, David paid approximately $13,000, Sulekha paid approximately \n$13,150, Thangamani paid approximately $13,000, Kandhasamy paid approximately $13,000, \nKhuttan paid approximately $18,785, Andrews paid approximately $11,380, Dhananjaya paid \napproximately $14,000, Kumar paid approximately $24,950, Singh paid approximately $22,000, \nand Chellappan paid approximately $22,000 for the opportunity to work at Signal. \n37.  At all relevant times, Signal would not accept Indian workers who did not use the \nRecruitersโ services.   \n38.  At all relevant times, the Recruiters acted as Signalโs agents and all actions the Recruiters \ntook during the recruitment process were with Signalโs express or implied authority.   \n39.  No welders or fitters directly employed by Signal, other than the Indian Workers, paid \nrecruitment fees in amounts comparable to the amounts the Indian Workers paid.   \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Docum  e  nt 179   Filed 11/07/12   Page 9 of 21\n40.  Upon information and belief, no welders or fitters directly employed by Signal, other \nthan the Indian Workers, paid recruitment fees that exceeded a few hundred dollars.   \n41.  Upon information and belief, no welders or fitters directly employed by Signal, other \nthan the Indian Workers, began their employment in debt as a product of recruitment fees.   \n42.  No welders or fitters directly employed by Signal, other than the Indian Workers, were \nrequired to use the Recruiters, nor any particular recruiter, in order to obtain employment at \nSignal. \n43.  The Indian Workers were hired by Signal to provide labor and services at its Pascagoula, \nMississippi, and Orange, Texas, locations. \n44.  The first Indian Workers arrived in the end of October 2006.  Additional workers came to \nthe United States in groups of 30 to 50 workers at a time until approximately March 2007. \n45.  Signal brought over a total of just under 500 Indian Workers to the United States, sending \napproximately 288 workers to its facility in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and approximately 200 \nworkers to its facility in Orange, Texas. \n46.  At each location, the Indian Workers were required to live in modular trailers called \nโman camps.โ  Signal built the โman campsโ for the exclusive use of the Indian Workers.  No \nother Signal employees were required to live in the โman camps.โ  \n47.  Before the Indian Workers were permitted to begin work, Signal required them to sign \nemployment and housing agreements. These agreements were written in English, few of the \nIndian Workers read or understood English well, and Signal did not give the Indian Workers \nadequate time to read or understand these documents. \n48.  One of these agreements allowed Signal to deduct $35 a day (or approximately $1050 per \nmonth) from each Indian Workerโs earnings to reimburse Signal for the cost of providing food, \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Docum e  nt 179   Filed 11/07/12   Page 10 of 21\naccommodations, and transportation for each such Indian Worker.  Under this agreement Signal \ncould continue to deduct this amount from the workerโs salary even if the Indian Worker elected \nnot to eat the meals provided by Signal and not to live in the accommodations provided by \nSignal.  These deductions also applied to days when for which the Indian Workers were not paid, \nsuch as holidays, sick days, weekends, and days with inclement weather where workers were \nunable to work. \n49.  The โman campsโ were located on Signal property in isolated, industrial areas miles \nremoved from shopping areas, places of worship, and residential communities.  The camps were \nenclosed by fences and accessible only through a single guarded entrance.  \n50.  Signal assigned numbers to each Indian Worker and used these numbers as a form of \nidentification and reference rather than using the employeeโs name. \n51.  Signal camp personnel and supervisors used offensive language in speaking with and/or \nreferring to the Indian Workers and insulted the Indian Workers on the basis of their race and/or \nnational origin.   \n52.  Signal guards monitored the comings and goings of the Indian Workers by requiring \nthem to show their employee identification badges.  Signal guards also searched the packages \nand bags of Indian Workers when they entered the camps. \n53.  Except on rare occasions, the Indian Workers were not permitted to receive visitors in the \nโman camps.โ \n54.  The โman campsโ were composed of a series of one room trailers connected by elevated \nwalkways.  Most of the trailers were for sleeping and were referred to as โbunkhouses.โ  Up to \ntwenty-four men were housed in each bunkhouse, sleeping in two-tiered bunk beds.  The bunk \nbeds were so tightly packed in the bunkhouses that it was difficult for the Indian Workers to \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Docum e  nt 179   Filed 11/07/12   Page 11 of 21\nmove about in the narrow passageways between bunks.  Signal recognized that the bunkhouses \nwere not compliant with the requirements of OSHA and decided against making them OSHA \ncompliant by having fewer Indian Workers in each bunkhouse because doing so would be too \nโonerousโ for Signal. \n55.  The bunkhouses had insufficient toileting and bathing facilities for the twenty-four men.  \nThe Indian Workers were forced to rise early to take their place in line for the few toilets and \nshowers in each trailer. \n56.  Privacy was non-existent for the Indian Workers. The Indian Workers experienced \nextreme difficulty sleeping due to the constant noise resulting from the close quarters and the \ncomings and goings of workers who worked on different shifts but were housed closely together \nin the same bunkhouses.  Signal also had control over when the lights were turned on and when \nthe lights were turned off in the bunkhouses as even that decision was not left up to the Indian \nWorkers. \n57.  Signal personnel conducted surprise searches of the bunkhouses, including searches of \nthe Indian Workersโ personal belongings. \n58.  The Indian Workers took their meals in mess halls which were part of the โman camps.โ  \nThe mess halls were only open during limited hours, set by Signal.  The food provided by Signal \nwas of poor quality and was frequently bad, stale or molded.  \n59.  As a result of unsanitary conditions, sickness was rampant in the camps, and the Indian \nWorkers sometimes required hospitalization.  \n60.  The โman campsโ had rules, enforced by Signal guards. The penalty for breaking rules \nwas $250 for the first violation and $500 for a second violation. \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Docum e  nt 179   Filed 11/07/12   Page 12 of 21\n61.  When the Indian Workers complained and asked to live outside the labor camps, Signal \ntold the workers that even if they lived outside the camps, Signal would continue to deduct the \n$35/day charge from the Indian Workersโ weekly wages.  As a result, the Indian Workers \nreasonably felt that they had no choice but to continue to live in the Signal โman camps.โ  No \nnon-Indian Signal employees who lived outside the camps had such deductions taken from their \nwages. \n62.  During the first two weeks of employing each Indian Worker, Signal also deducted \nbetween $100 and $200 a week from each employeeโs paycheck for tool kits which the Indian \nWorkers were required to purchase from Signal.  On information and belief, Signal did not \nrequire non-Indian workers to buy tools from Signal.    \n63.  Vijayan and Kadakkarappally routinely complained to Signal, on behalf of themselves \nand the other Indian Workers, about the food, living conditions, camp facilities, camp rules, and \nterms and conditions of employment at Signal. Vijayan and Kadakkarappally frequently met \nwith fellow Indian Workers to learn of their concerns relating to the conditions under which they \nwere forced to work by Signal. \n64.  In response to these complaints, Signal personnel warned the Indian Workers to stop \ncomplaining. Signal personnel and management regularly threatened the Indian Workers that if \nthey did not continue working for Signal or did not work to Signalโs specifications, they would \nbe deported to India. \n65.  After Signal ignored the Indian Workersโ complaints regarding housing, food, and terms \nand conditions of employment, the Indian Workers living in the Pascagoula โman campโ \ncontinued meeting to discuss how to persuade Signal to improve the working conditions of the \nIndian Workers. \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Docum e  nt 179   Filed 11/07/12   Page 13 of 21\n66.  On or about March 4, 2007, Vijayan, Kadakkarappally, and other Indian workers met \nwith attorneys in a church near the Pascagoula facility. The purpose of this meeting was to \ndiscuss their rights as employees of Signal.   \n67.  Signal learned of the aforementioned meeting held on or about March 4, 2007. The \nrecruiting agent Signal used in India, Sachin Dewan, called Vijayanโs wife at her home in India \nand warned her that Vijayan must stop making complaints about Signal or Signal would return \nthe Indian Workers to India.  Vijayanโs wife informed Vijayan of this call.  \n68.  Vijayan informed the other Indian Workers about the call which his wife had received \nand word spread quickly through the Pascagoula and Orange camps regarding the threats against \nVijayan. \n69.  Vijayan and Kadakkarappally took leading roles in gathering information and voicing the \ncomplaints of the other Indian Workers to Signal.  \n70.  Signal called a meeting of the Indian Workers on or about March 8, 2007.  At this \nmeeting, Signal management told the Indian Workers that Signal would fight back against any \norganizing efforts by the workers and that if Indian Workers brought any legal action against \nSignal, Signal would not extend any of the Indian Workersโ H-2B visas, despite Signalโs \nprevious promises of extensions.     \n71.  The next morning, March 9, 2007, Signal locked the gate to the Pascagoula โman campโ, \nthereby obstructing the sole means of direct entry to and exit from the camp.  Signal camp \ncoordinator Darrell Snyder and approximately five security guards then swept through the \nbunkhouses carrying pictures of Vijayan, Kadakkarappally and other Indian Workers. \n72.       Shortly after 5:00 a.m. on March 9, 2007, Signal forcibly transported Vijayan, \nKadakkarappally and three other Indian Workers from their bunkhouse to another trailer used as \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Docum e  nt 179   Filed 11/07/12   Page 14 of 21\na TV room.  Signalโs plan was to keep these employees in the room, to discharge them from \nemployment, and then to transport them to the airport for immediate return to India.  Signalโs \nplan was altered with regard to Vijayan because he attempted suicide by cutting his wrist. The \nother workers were placed in the TV room and kept there by guards who had instructions from \nSignal not to let the workers leave the room. \n73.  On March 9, 2007, Signal discharged Vijayan and Kadakkarappally because of their \ncomplaints, organizing efforts, and discussions of discriminatory terms and conditions of \nemployment. \n74.  Starting with the mandatory use of the Recruiters and continuing until the employment of \nall Indian Workers ceased,  Signal subjected such employees to terms and conditions of \nemployment that were less favorable than those enjoyed by their non-Indian counterparts.  \n75.  This unequal treatment included, but was not limited to, Indian Workers being assigned \nthe most undesirable work at the facilities which non-Indian Workers were not asked to perform, \nharassment and insults based on the workersโ race and national origin, mandatory subjection to \ninferior living conditions in the man camps where no non-Indian workers were required to live, \nmandatory rent and meal deductions, mandatory use of the Recruiters who required payment of \nhigh recruitment fees, and other disparate terms and conditions of employment.  \nCOUNT I \n[Title VII Hostile Work Environment Based on National Origin/Race] \n[Claim by All Plaintiffs-Intervenors] \n76.

Signalโs \nsupervisors and managers made offensive and unwanted derogatory comments about the \nPlaintiffs-Intervenors and other Indian Workers and engaged in a series of demeaning and \ndiscriminatory actions, specifically directed solely at the Plaintiffs-Intervenors and other Indian \nWorkers based on their race and/or national origin.   \n79.  Signalโs conduct was offensive, severe, unwelcome and pervasive and interfered with the \nIndian Workersโ working conditions.

J โข r I ell  ~ \n) \nPlaintiff,  )  COMPLAINT \nVS.  )  and \n) \nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL, LLC  )  JURY TRIAL REQUEST \nDefendant.  ) \n) \nNATURE OF THE ACTION \nThis  is  an  action  under  Title  VII  of the  Civil  Rights  Act  of 1964,  as \namended, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e, et.  seq., and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 \n(\"Title VII\"),  to  correct unlawful employment practices on the basis of national \norigin, race, and retaliation, and to provide appropriate relief to  Sabulal Vijayan \n(\"Vijayan\"),  Joseph Jacob Kadakkarappally (\"Kadakkarappally\"),  and a class of \nover 500 similarly situated Indian nationals (collectively referred to herein as \"the \nIndian  Employees\")  brought  to  the  United  States  by  Defendant  Signal \nInternational, LLC (\"Signal\") from the country of India to work as employees at \nSignal facilities in Mississippi and Texas. \nSignal's unlawful practices  adversely affected the  Indian Employees  as  a \nclass.  Plaintiff,  the  U.S.  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission \n(\"Commission\"),  alleges  Signal  violated  Title  VII  by  subjecting  Vijayan, \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 04/20/11   Page 2 of 20\nKadakkarappally, and similarly situated Indian Employees to:  (1) a hostile work \nenvironment  based  on  national  origin  (Indian),  and/or  race  (Asian);  and  (2) \ndisparate,  segregated,  and  discriminatory  treatment,  concerning  the  terms  and \nconditions  of their  employment.  Moreover,  Plaintiff  alleges  Signal  retaliated \nagainst Vijayan and Kadakkarappally, because they opposed Defendant's unlawful \nconduct.  Finally, the Commission contends that Defendant engaged in a pattern or \npractice  of discrimination  against  the  Indian  Employees  because  of their  race \nand/or national origin,  intending to deny to said employees the full enjoyment of \nthe rights guaranteed by Title VII. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1.  Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28  U.S.C.  ยงยง  451, \n1331,  1337,  1343, and 1345. This action is authorized and instituted pursuant to \n706(ยฃ)(1) and (3) and 707 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, \n42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-5(ยฃ)(1) and (ยฃ)(3), 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-6, and ยง 102 of the Civil \nRights Act of 1991,42 U.S.C. ยง 1981a. \n2.  This  Court  has  proper venue.  Most  of the  employment  practices \nalleged to be unlawful were committed within the jurisdiction of the United States \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff,  the  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission  (the \n2 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 04/20/11   Page 3 of 20\n\"Commission\"), is the agency of the United States of America charged with the \nadministration,  interpretation  and  enforcement  of Title  VII,  and  is  expressly \nauthorized to bring this action by ยงยง 706(f)(1), 706(f)(3), and 707, of Title VII, 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 2000e-5(f)(1) and (3) and ยง 2000e-6. \n4.  At all relevant times, Defendant Signal, a Delaware corporation, has \nbeen doing business in the City of Pascagoula, State of Mississippi, and Orange, \nTexas.  Signal is engaged in the business of building and repairing off-shore oil \nngs. \n5.  At all relevant times herein, Defendant Signal has continuously been \nan employer engaged in an industry affecting commerce within the meaning of ยง \n701(b), (g) and (h) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-(b), (g) and (h). \nCONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO SUIT \n6.  More than thirty days prior to the institution of this action, Vijayan and \nKadakkarappally filed  charges with the Commission alleging violations of Title \nVII by Signal. \n7.  All conditions precedent to the institution of this lawsuit have been \nfulfilled, to-wit: \na)  Vijayan  and  Kadakkarappally  filed  timely  charges  of \ndiscrimination with the Commission; \n3 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 04/20/11   Page 4 of 20\nb)  The  Commission  issued  Determinations  regarding  the \nallegations made by Vijayan and Kadakkarappally in which the Commission \nconcluded, inter alia, that: \n1)  Defendant  discriminated  against  Vijayan, \nKadakkarappally and the  Indian  Employees  as  a  class  in  the \nterms and conditions of their employment because of their race \nand/or national origin, in violation of Title VII; \n2)  Defendant  subjected Vijayan,  Kadakkarappally and  the \nIndian  Employees  as  a  class  to  a  hostile  work  environment \nbecause of their race and/or national origin, in violation of Title \nVII; and \n3)  Defendant  retaliated  against  Vijayan  and \nKadakkarappally  because  they  opposed  conduct  which  they \nbelieved in good faith to be unlawful under Title VII; \nc)  The  Commission  made  a  good  faith  effort  to  resolve  these \nfindings  through  conciliation,  conference,  and  persuasion.  Those  efforts \nproved unsuccessful. \nSTATEMENT OF CLAIMS \n8.  Defendant,  in  the  aftermath  of Hurricane  Katrina,  was  unable  to \nobtain a sufficient number of qualified and reliable pipe fitters and welders to meet \n4 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 04/20/11   Page 5 of 20\nthe demands of its work load. \n9.  Defendant, to meet this need, arranged to bring into the United States \nover  500  Indian  men  through  the  federal  government's  H-2B  guestworker \nprogram.  These Indian Employees were hired by Defendant to provide labor and \nservices at its Pascagoula, Mississippi, and Orange, Texas, locations. \n10.  The  first  workers  arrived  in  the  end  of October,  2006.  Additional \nworkers came over in waves of 30 to 50 workers until on or about March, 2007. \n11.  Defendant brought  over more  than  500  Indian  employees,  sending \nsome of these workers to its facility in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and others to its \nfacility in Orange, Texas. \n12.  At  each  location  the  Indian  Employees  were  required  to  live  in \nmodular trailers called \"man camps.\"  The  \"man  camps\"  were  built  for  the \nexclusive use of the Indian Employees.  No other Signal employees were required \nto live in the \"man camps.\" \n13.  Before  the  Indian  Employees  were  permitted  to  begin  work, \nDefendant  required  them  to  sign  employment  and  housing  agreements.  These \nagreements were written in English, and Defendant did not give the Indian workers \nadequate time to read or understand these documents. \n14.  One of these agreements allowed Defendant to deduct $35 a day (or \n5 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 04/20/11   Page 6 of 20\n$1050 per month) from each Indian worker's earnings to reimburse Defendant for \nthe  cost  of providing  food,  accommodations,  and  transportation  for  each  such \nIndian Employee.  Under this agreement Defendant could continue to deduct this \namount from the worker's salary even if the Indian Employee elected not to eat the \nmeals provided by Defendant and not to live in the accommodations provided by \nDefendant. \n15.  The  \"man  camps\"  were  located  on  Signal  property  in  isolated, \nindustrial  areas  miles  removed  from  shopping  areas,  places  of worship,  and \nresidential communities.  The camps were enclosed by fences and accessible only \nthrough a single guarded entrance. \n16.  Signal  assigned numbers  to  each  Indian  Employee  and  used these \nnumbers as a form of identification and reference rather than using the employee's \nname. \n17.  Signal  camp  personnel  and  supervisors  used  offensive  language  in \nspeaking with and/or referring to  the  Indian Employees  and insulted the  Indian \nEmployees on the basis of their race and/or national origin. \n18.  Signal  guards  monitored  the  comings  and  gomgs  of the  Indian \nEmployees by requiring them to show their employee identification badges.  Signal \nguards  also  searched  the  packages  and  bags  of Indian  Employees  when  they \nentered the camps. \n6 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 04/20/11   Page 7 of 20\n19.  Except on rare occasions, the Indian Employees were not permitted to \nreceive visitors in the \"man camps.\" \n20.  The  \"man camps\" were  composed of a series  of one room trailers \nconnected by elevated walkways.  Most of the trailers were for sleeping and were \nreferred  to  as  \"bunkhouses.\"  Up  to  twenty-four  men  were  housed  in  each \nbunkhouse,  sleeping  in  two-tiered  bunk beds.  The  bunk beds  were  so  tightly \npacked in the bunkhouses that it was difficult for the workers to move about in the \nnarrow passageways between bunks. \n21.  The bunkhouses had insufficient toileting and bathing facilities for the \ntwenty-four men.  The Indian Employees were  forced to  rise early to  take their \nplace in line for the few toilets and showers in each trailer. \n22.  Privacy  was  non-existent  for  the  Indian  Employees.  The  Indian \nEmployees  experienced  extreme  difficulty  sleeping  due  to  the  constant  noise \nresulting  from  the  close  quarters  and the  comings  and  goings  of workers  who \nworked on different shifts. \n22.  Signal  personnel  conducted  surpnse  searches  of the  bunkhouses, \nincluding searching of worker's personal belongings. \n23.  The Indian Employees took their meals in mess halls which were part \nof the \"man camps.\"  The mess halls were only open during limited hours, set by \nSignal.  The food provided by Signal was of poor quality and was frequently bad, \n7 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 04/20/11   Page 8 of 20\nstale or molded. \n24.  As  a  result  of unsanitary  conditions,  sickness  was  rampant  in  the \ncamps, and the Indian Employees sometimes required hospitalization. \n25.  The \"man camps\" had rules, enforced by Signal guards. The penalty \nfor breaking rules was $250 for the first violation and $500 for a second violation. \n26.  When the Indian Employees complained and asked to live outside the \nlabor camps, Defendant Signal told the workers that even if they lived outside the \ncamps,  Signal  would  continue  to  deduct  the  $35/day  charge  from  the  Indian \nEmployee's weekly wage.  As a result,  the Indian Employees reasonably felt that \nthey had no choice but to continue to live in the Signal \"man camps.\" \n27.  During  the  first  two  weeks  of employing  each  Indian  Employee, \nDefendant  Signal  also  deducted  between  $100  and  $200  a  week  from  each \nemployee's paycheck for tool kits which the Indian Employees were required to \npurchase from Defendant Signal. \n28.  Vijayan  and  Kadakkarappally  routinely  complained  to  Signal,  on \nbehalf of themselves  and  the  other  Indian  Employees,  about  the  food,  living \nconditions, camp facilities, camp rules, and terms and conditions of employment at \nSignal.  Vijayan  and  Kadakkarappally  frequently  met  with  fellow  Indian \nEmployees to learn of their concerns relating to the conditions under which they \nwere forced to work by SignaL \n8 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 04/20/11   Page 9 of 20\n29.  In response to these complaints,  Signal personnel warned the Indian \nEmployees  to  stop  complaining.  Signal  personnel  and  management  regularly \nthreatened the Indian Employees that if they did not continue working for Signal or \ndid not work to Signal's specifications they would be deported to India. \n30.  After complaining to Signal about the housing, food,  and the overall \nterms  and  conditions  of  employment,  the  Indian  Employees  living  in  the \nPascagoula \"man camp\" began meeting to discuss how to persuade Defendant to \nimprove the working conditions of the Indian Employees. \n31.  On  or  about  March 4,  2007,  Vijayan,  Kadakkarappally,  and  other \nIndian Employees met with attorneys in a church near the Pascagoula facility. The \npurpose of this meeting was to discuss their rights as employees of Signal. \n32.  Signal learned of the aforementioned meeting held on or about March \n4,  2007.  The  recruiting  agent  Defendant  Signal  used  in  India,  Sachin  Dewan, \ncalled Vijayan's wife at her home in India and warned her that Vijayan must stop \nmaking complaints about Signal or Signal would return the Indian Employees to \nIndia.  Vijayan's wife informed Vijayan of this call. \n33.  Vijayan informed the other Indian Employees about the call which his \nwife had received and word spread quickly through the  Pascagoula and Orange \ncamps regarding the threats against Vijayan. \n9 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 04/20/11   Page 10 of 20\n34.  Vijayan  and  Kadakkarappally  took  leading  roles  in  gathering \ninformation and voicing the complaints of the other Indian Employees to Signal. \n35.  Defendant Signal called a meeting of the Indian Employees on March \n8,  2007.  At  this  meeting,  in  the  presence  of Signal's  legal  counsel,  Signal \nmanagement told the Indian Employees that:  1) they were not being mistreated; 2) \nthey  were  complaining  too  much;  3)  management  would  only  respond  to \ncomplaints which it considered were legitimate; 4) Signal would fight back against \nany organizing efforts by the  workers;  and  5) if the  workers brought any legal \naction against Signal, Signal would not extend the Indian employee's H-2B visas. \n36.  The  next  morning,  March  9,  2007,  Signal  locked  the  gate  to  the \nPascagoula \"man camp\", thereby obstructing the sole means of direct entry to and \nfrom the camp.  Signal camp coordinator Darrell Snyder and approximately five \nsecurity guards then swept through the bunkhouses carrying pictures of Vijayan, \nKadakkarappally and other Indian Employees. \n37.  Shortly after 5:00 a.m. on March 9, 2007, Signal forcibly transported \nVijayan, Kadakkarappally and three other Indian Employees from their bunkhouse \nto another trailer used as a TV room.  Signal's plan was to keep these employees in \nthe room, to discharge them from employment, and then to transport them to the \nairport  for  immediate return  to  India.  Signal's plan was  only altered because \nVijayan, en route to the TV room, attempted suicide by cutting his wrists. \n10 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 04/20/11   Page 11 of 20\n38.  On March 9, 2007, Signal discharged Vijayan and Kadakkarappally. \n39.  Shortly after the Indian Employees arrived in the United States, and \ncontinuing until the employment of all Indian Employees ceased,  Signal subjected \nsuch employees to terms and conditions of employment that were less favorable \nthan enjoyed by their non-Indian counterparts. \n40.  This  unequal  treatment  included  but  was  not  limited  to  Indian \nEmployees being assigned the most undesirable work which non-Indian employees \nwere  not  asked  to  perform  and  other  disparate  terms  and  conditions  of \nemployment. \nCOUNT I \n[Title VII Hostile Work Environment Based on National Origin/Race] \n41.  Plaintiff incorporates and reasserts the aforementioned paragraphs six \n(6) through forty (40) of this Complaint. \n42.  Since  at  least  October  2006,  Signal  has  engaged  in  unlawful \nemployment practices at their Pascagoula and Orange locations in violation of ยง \n703(a)  of Title  VII,  42  U.S.C.  ยง  2000e-2(a),  including  subjecting  the  class  of \nIndian Employees to  a hostile work environment based on race  and/or national \nongm. \n43.  Signal created and perpetuated a hostile work environment against the \nIndian Employees based on their race and/or national origin. Signal's supervisors \n11 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 04/20/11   Page 12 of 20\nand  managers  made  offensive  and  unwanted  derogatory  comments  about  the \nIndian  employees  and  engaged  in  a  series  of demeaning  and  discriminatory \nactions,  specifically directed solely at the Indian Employees based on their race \nand/or national origin. \n44.  Signal's conduct was offensive, severe, unwelcome and pervasive and \ninterfered with their working conditions. In addition to the conditions previously \ndescribed in this Complaint,  Signal subjected the  Indian Employees to  a hostile \nwork environment, which included but was not limited to: \na)  Calling the Indian Employees insulting and offensive comments based \non their race and/or national origin; \nb)  Calling the Indian Employees \"thieves\" and \"animals\"; \nc)  Telling Indian Employees to \"shut up\" when Indian Employees raised \ncomplaints to Signal; \nd)  Telling  Indian  Employees  that  the  conditions  which  they  were \nIn \nliving were better than the slums in India; and \ne)  Referring  to  the  Indian  Employees  as  \"F .. .ing  Keralites\",  \"rat[s]\", \n\"chronic whiners\", and \"back-stabbing whining little bitches\". \n45.  The hostile environment that existed at Signal facilities  was created \nand perpetuated at the direction of Signal's management and supervisory personnel \nwith direct supervisory and/or managerial authority over the Indian Employees. \n46.  The unlawful hostile environment occurred with the full knowledge of \nSignal's  management  and  supervisory  personnel,  and  Signal  failed  to  exercise \n12 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 04/20/11   Page 13 of 20\nreasonable  care  either to  prevent the  creation of this  hostile  environment or to \ncorrect promptly the hostile environment once it existed. \n47.  The  unlawful  employment  practices  complained  of  in  the \naforementioned  paragraphs  six  (6)  through  forty-six  (46)  were  intentional,  and \ndone with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of \nVijayan, Kadakkarappally, and similarly situated Indian Employees. \n48.  The  effect  of  the  intentional  practices  complained  of  in \naforementioned  paragraphs  six  (6)  through  forty-six  (46)  has  been  to  deprive \nVijayan,  Kadakkarappally,  and  similarly  situated  Indian  Employees  of equal \nemployment opportunities and otherwise adversely affect their status as employees \nbecause of their race and/or national origin. \nCOUNT II \n[Title VII National Origin/Race Discrimination: \nEmployment Terms & Conditions] \n49.  Plaintiff incorporates and reasserts the aforementioned paragraphs six \n(6) through forty-eight (48) of this Complaint. \n50.  Since  at  least  October,  2006,  Defendant  has  engaged  in  unlawful \nemployment practices at its Pascagoula, Mississippi, and Orange, Texas, facilities \nin violation of ยง702(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(a). \n51.  Shortly after the Indian Employees arrived in the United States, and \ncontinuing until the employment of al Indian Employees ceased,  Signal subjected \n13 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 04/20/11   Page 14 of 20\nsuch employees to terms and conditions of employment that were less favorable \nthan enjoyed by their non-Indian counterparts. \n52.  This unequal treatment included but was not limited to being assigned \nthe most undesirable work which non-Indian employees were not asked to perform \nand other disparate terms and conditions of employment. \n53.  The  unlawful  employment  practices  complained  of  in  the \naforementioned paragraphs  six  (6)  through  fifty-two  (52)  were  intentional,  and \ndone with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of \nVijayan, Kadakkarappally, and similarly situated Indian Employees. \n54.  The  effect  of  the  intentional  practices  complained  of  in \naforementioned  paragraphs  six  (6)  through  fifty-two  (52)  has  been  to  deprive \nVijayan,  Kadakkarappally,  and  similarly  situated  Indian  Employees  of equal \nemployment opportunities and otherwise adversely affect their status as employees \nbecause of their race and/or national origin. \nCOUNT III \n[Title VII Retaliation] \n55.  Plaintiff incorporates and reasserts the aforementioned paragraphs six \n(6) through fifty-four (54) of this Complaint. \n56.  Defendant  Signal  engaged in unlawful  employment practices  at  its \nPascagoula, Mississippi, facility in violation of ยง704(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. ยง \n14 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 04/20/11   Page 15 of 20\n2000e-3(a). \n57.  Vijayan and Kadakkarappally, on behalf of themselves and the other \nIndian Employees,  opposed Signal's treatment of the  Indian Employees,  which \nthey reasonably believed in good faith to constitute discrimination in violation of \nTitle  VII.  Signal  was  aware  of this  opposition  on  the  part  of Vijayan  and \nKadakkarappally.  As  set  forth  in  detail  in  the  preceding  paragraphs  of this \nComplaint,  Signal retaliated against Vijayan and Kadakkarappally because  they \nopposed Signal's discriminatory treatment of the Indian workers by increasing the \nseverity of the discriminatory terms and conditions of their employment, forcibly \ndetaining  them  against  their  will,  and  discharging  them  from  employment,  on \nMarch 9, 2007. \n58.  The  unlawful  employment  practices  complained  of  in  the \naforementioned paragraphs six (6) through fifty-seven (57) were intentional, and \ndone with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of \nVijayan and Kadakkarappally. \n59.  The  effect  of  the  intentional  practices  complained  of  in \naforementioned paragraphs six (6)  through fifty-seven  (57)  has been to  deprive \nVijayan,  and Kadakkarappally,  individually,  of equal  employment opportunities \nand  otherwise  adversely affect their status  as  employees  because  they opposed \npractices made unlawful by Title VII. \n15 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 04/20/11   Page 16 of 20\nCOUNT IV \n[Pattern or Practice Violation] \n60.  Plaintiff incorporates and reasserts the aforementioned paragraphs six \n(6) through fifty-nine (59) of this Complaint. \n61.  Defendant has engaged in a pattern or practice of subjecting its Indian \nEmployees  to  a  hostile  environment  and  disparate  terms  and  conditions  of \nemployment based on their race and national origin. \n62.  The  unlawful  employment  practices  complained  of  in  the \naforementioned paragraphs  six (6)  through sixty-one  (61)  were  intentional,  and \ndone with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of \nVijayan, Kadakkarappally, and similarly situated Indian Employees. \n63.  The  effect  of  the  intentional  practices  complained  of  in \naforementioned  paragraphs  six  (6)  through  sixty-one  (61)  has  been  to  deprive \nVijayan,  Kadakkarappally,  and  similarly  situated  Indian  Employees  of equal \nemployment opportunities and otherwise adversely affect their status as employees \nbecause of their race and/or national origin. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court: \nA.  Grant  a  permanent  injunction  enjoining  Defendant  Employer,  its \nofficers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys, and all persons in active concert or \n16 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 04/20/11   Page 17 of 20\nparticipation with them from engaging in discrimination based on race or national \norigin:  (1)  in  the  terms  and  conditions  of employment  and  (2)  in  decisions \nregarding workplace discipline and termination. \nB.

Order Defendant Signal to institute and carry out policies, practices, and \nprograms  which provide equal  employment opportunities  for  Indian Employees \nand  which  eradicate  the  effects  of its  past  and  present  unlawful  employment \npractices. \nD.  Order Defendant  Signal  to  make  whole  all  of the  Indian  Employees \nwrongfully discharged or reduced in pay by providing appropriate backpay with \nprejudgment interest, in amounts to be determined at trial, and other affirmative \nrelief necessary to eradicate the effects of its unlawful employment practices. \nE.  Order  Defendant  Signal  to  make  the  Indian  Employees  whole  by \ncompensation  for  past and  future  pecuniary losses  resulting  from  the  unlawful \nemployment  practices  described  in  paragraphs  six  (6)  through  sixty-four  (64) \nabove, including relocation expenses, job search expenses, and medical expenses \n17 \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 04/20/11   Page 18 of 20\nnot covered by the Signal's employee benefit plans in amounts to be determined at \ntrial. \nF.

Signal (12-557)\nORDER AND REASONS\nBefore the Court is defendant Signal In ternational, LLC's (\"Signal\") Motion to\n1\n\nReview Magistrate Judge's Order.1 Plaintiff, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n(\"EEOC\") opposes Signal's motion.2 Plaintiffs-Intervenors also oppose Signal's motion.3\nBACKGROUND\nThe EEOC brought suit against Signal under Ttile VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\nas amended, 42 U.S.C. ยง2000e,  et. seq.  (\"Title VII\"), for discriminating against\napproximately 500 Indian national employe es who worked and lived in Pascagoula,\nMississippi and Orange, Texas. The EEOC and Signal each filed a Motion for a Protective\nOrder on July 16, 2013. The EEOC sought an order protecting private information of the\nIndian employees and their families from discovery, including immigration status, history\nor proceedings, their post-Signal employment and income history, and their post-Signal\naddresses.4 Signal opposed the EEOC's motion, ar guing the information is necessary to\nprotect its constitutional right under the Fi fth Amendment to impeach those testifying\nagainst Signal because the information is probaitve of bias, motive, and lack of credibility5.\nSignal filed a motion seeking a protective order of its own to prevent the dissemination of\ninformation gained through pretrial discov ery and to make former Signal employees'\naddresses and telephone numbers privy to only counsel in the case.6 \nThe Magistrate Judge granted in part and denied in part the parties' motions in a\n1R. Doc. 252. \n2R. Doc. 281.\n3R. Doc. 265.\n4R. Doc. 207. \n5R. Doc. 215.\n6R. Doc. 208. \n2\n\nsingle order on September 10, 2013.7 The Magistrate Judge granted the EEOC's protective\norder with respect to the private informationo f the employees and their families, including\nimmigration information, post-Signal employment and income history, post-Signal\naddresses, and tax documents.8 Signal's protective order was granted in part, and limited\nthe use of materials gleaned through pretrial discovery to preparation for and for use at\ntrial.9 The Magistrate Judge also granted Signal's  protective order limiting disclosure of\nSignal's former employees' addresses and telephone numbers to only those persons deemed\nin good faith necessary to the prosecution of the lawsuit.10\nBecause the parties submitted competing protective orders acc ompanying their\nmotions, the Magistrate Judge directed the  parties to submit a si ngle, joint, proposed\nprotective order in compliance with the September 10 order.11 The parties submitted the\njoint protective order on November 4, 2013.12\nSignal filed a Motion to Review Magistrate's Order on September 26, 2013 and that\nmotion is presently before the Court. Signal's motion only seeks review of the Magistrate\nJudge's order to the extent it prevented discovery regardingi mmigration history and status,\n7R. Doc. 237.\n8Id., pp. 11-12.\n9Id., p. 13.\n10Id. p. 15.  The Magistrate Judge further stated it would not order parties to serve supoenas on\nnon-parties if parties wished to speak to the non-parties. Lastly, the Magistrate Judge's order stated the\nparties may request Electronically Stored Information (ESI) in any format they choose, and the protective\norder in David v. Signal (08-1220) requiring ESI in non-native format was not applicable to this case.\n(Doc. 1352 in David). \n11Id.,  p. 15. \n12R. Doc. 284. The temporary government shut down during October 2013 prevented the parties\nfrom submitting the joint proposed protective order until November 4, 2013. (See R. Doc. 260). \n3\n\npost-Signal employment, and tax returns.13 \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nSignal seeks review of the Magistrate Judge's ruling based on Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 72(a) and Local Rule 72.2. If a paryt disagrees with a Magistrate Judge's ruling,\nthe \"district judge in the case must consider timely objections and modify or set aside any\npart of the order that is clearly erroneous or contrary to law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a); LR 72.2.\nAs another section of this Court summarized:\nUnder this standard, factual findings are reviewed for clear error, which is\npresent when the reviewing court upone xamination of the entire evidence is\nleft with the definite and firm conviciton that a mistake has been committed.\nConclusions of law should be overturned when the magistrate fails to apply\nor misapplies relevant statutes, case law or rules o fprocedure. For issues that\nare committed by law to a judge's disc retion, such as the resolution of\ndiscovery disputes, the magi strate's rulings are reviewed for abuse of\ndiscretion.\nKiln Underwriting Ltd. v. Jesuit High Sch. of New Orleans, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86286\n(E.D. La. Oct. 24, 2008)(Berrigan, J)(citations and quotation marks omitted). \nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nSignal argues the Magistrate Judge committed legal error in preventing the discovery\nof the employees' private immigration and post-Signal information because the Magistrate\nJudge did not fully consider Signal's Fifth Amendment right to cross examine witnesses.\nSignal argues the Magistrate Judge attributed \"too little weight to Signal's right to cross\nexamine for motive.\"14 Signal frames the Magistrate Judge's ruling as legal error and asks\n13R. Doc. 252, p. 2. \n14R. Doc. 252, p. 1. \n4\n\nthis Court to overturn the Magistrate Judge's ruling.15 \nHaving reviewed the record, the Magist rate Judge's order, and the parties'\nmemoranda, the Court does not find any lega l error. The Magistrate Judge's order fully\nexamined and balanced the relevance  of the immigration information, the  in terrorem\neffect on the employees, and Signal's right  to cross-examine witnesses.  The Magistrate\nJudge found the information to be irrelevant, and concluded thei n terrorem effect caused\nby seeking the employees' immigration information outweighed Signal's interests in using\nthe information to cross examine witnesses.  Signal has not shown the Magistrate Judge\n\"fail[ed] to apply or misapplie[d] relevant statutes, case law or rules of procedure.\"  Kiln\nUnderwriting Ltd. v. Jesuit High Sch. of New Orleans, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86286 (E.D.\nLa. Oct. 24, 2008)(citations and quotation marks omitted). Thus, the Magistrate Judge's\nruling is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Id. \nAfter considering the arguments of the parties and the decision of the Magistrate\nJudge, in which he fully considered Signa l's right to cross examine witnesses, the Court\nfinds the Magistrate Judge did not abuse his discretion.\nAccordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the Magistrate Judge's order prohibiting the\ndiscovery of immigration status, history, proceedings, and opst-Signal employment and tax\nreturns is AFFIRMED. \nNew Orleans, Louisiana, this _2_n_d day of December, 2013.\n                                                            \n_____________________________               \n          SUSIE MORGAN\n                                     UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n15R.

(\"Title VII\"), for discriminating\nagainst approximately 500 Indian national employees who worked and lived in Pscaagoula,\nMississippi and Orange, Texas.T he EEOC's claims are brought pursuant its authority under\nยงยง 706 and 707 of Title VII o n behalf of a class of Indian employees.6 The EEOC alleges\nSignal 1) created a hostile work environment  for the Indian employees (in violation of ยง\n703(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(a));  2) discriminated against and subjected the\nIndian employees to disparate terms and conditions of employment based upon their race\n1R.

United States , 431 U.S. 324\n(1997).16 The Court directed all remaining claims asserted by the EEOC and the plaintiffs-\nintervenors to be tried in Phase II, includ ing Signal's liability  for punitive damages.17\nBecause the pleadings revealed that the EEOC and Signal disagreed over the burdens of\nproof, recoverable damages, and the interpretation of ยง 706 and ยง 707 of Title VII, the Court\nfurther ordered the parties to submit proposed  case management orders to identify the\nexact claims to be tried in each phase, the statutory basis fore ach claim, the burden of proof\nto be applied to each cla im, and whether or not a pattern or practice finding in Phase I\nwould have any effect in Phase II18.

The parties were afforded an additional\nopportunity to express their concerns by submitting letters to the Court.21\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nAfter considering the issuesr aised in the parties' proposed discovery plans and case\nmanagement orders, the Court grants the EEOC's Motion for Entry of Discovery Plan and\nCase Management Order.  The Court will entear  separate case management order for Phase\nI.22  \nThe Court also grants the parties' oral request for clarification of its August 19, 2013\nOrder23 and Reasons bifurcating the case, as set forth below.  \nI. Phase I\n(A) EEOC's ยงยง 706 and 707 Pattern or Practice Claims\nThe parties disagree as to whether  the EEOC may bring itsp attern or practice claim\nfor disparate treatment under both ยงยง 706 and  707 of Title VII, and, if so, wheth er both\nclaims may be tried in Phase I. \n20R. Doc. 228.\n21R. Doc. 300. Both the EEOC and Signal submitted letters with respect to whether or not Phase I\nwould be tried by a jury. See Doc. 302, Doc. 303. Signal also submitted a letter regarding whether or not\nthe EEOC could bring a pattern or practice claim under ยง 706. See Doc. 301. \n22R. Doc. 317. \n23R. Doc. 228.\n5\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 316   Filed 12/04/13   Page 6 of 11\nThe EEOC alleges pattern or practice claims in its complaint under  ยงยง 706 and 707\nand argues it may proceed under theT eamsters framework for both.24 All parties agree that\npattern and practi ce claims generally proceed under the framework delineated in\nTeamsters. The Teamsters model begins with a \"liability\" stage, where \"the EEOC must first\nestablish a prima facie case of pattern or  practice by 'demonstrat[ ing] that unlawful\ndiscrimination has been a regular procedure or policy followed by an employer or group of\nemployers.'\" EEOC v. JBS USA, LLC , 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87127 (D. Colo. Aug. 8,\n2011)(quoting Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 360).  The burden the nshifts to the employer to rebut\nthe prima facie showing of pattern or practice by showing the EEOC's proof is \"inaccurate\nor insignificant.\" Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 360.  \nSignal contends the EEOC cannot pursue a pattern or practice claim under ยง 706\nusing the Teamsters model because only claims under ยง 707 may proceed usinTg eamsters.\nSignal relies upon the decis ion in EEOC v. Bass Pro Outdoor World, LLC , where the\nSouthern District of Texas outlined the treatment of pattern or practice claims under ยงยง 706\nand 707 among district courts:\n\"Notwithstanding [the differences between ยง 706 and  ยง 707] , court s have\nblurred the line between class-wide claims brought pursuant to ยง 706 a nd\npattern-or-practice claims brought pursuant to ยง 707.\"  EEOC v. Scolari\nWarehouse Mkts., Inc., 488 F. Supp. 2d 1117, 1143 (D. Nev. 2007)(citing\nGeneral Telephone v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 328 n.12 (1980); EEOC v. Gen.\nTel. Co. of the Northwest, Inc., 885 F.2d 575, 577 (9th Cir. 1989);  EEOC v.\nFoster Wheeler Constructors, Inc ., No. 98 C 1601, 1999 U.S. Dist. LE XIS\n11226, 1999 WL 528200, at *1 (N.D. Il l1.999)). Some courts have determined\nthat \"the EEOC may bring suit alleging  a pattern or practice of unlawful\ndiscrimination under section 706 or section 707, but if the suit arises from a\ncharge filed pursuant to section  706, then the  EEOC must meet the\nprerequisites of section 706 bef ore filing suit.\"  EEOC v. Int'l Profit\nAssociates, Inc., No. 01 C 4427, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19070, 2007 WL\n24R. Doc. 231. The EEOC's Proposed Discovery Plan and Case Management Order. \n6\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 316   Filed 12/04/13   Page 7 of 11\n844555, at *9 (N.D. Ill. March 16, 2007). For example, inS colari, the District\nCourt of Nevada determined that pattern-or-practice claims could be brought\npursuant to ยง 706, even though doing so, \"when Congress specifically created\nanother avenue to bring such claims[,] creates an apparent redundacny in the\nlaw that troubles the Court.\" Scolari Warehouse Mkts., Inc., 488 F.Supp.2d\nat 1144. The court based its de cision on several factors. First, the court\nobserved that there were several in tersections between ยง 706 and ยง 707,\nincluding the fact that ยง 707(e) incorporates the procedural requirements of\nยง 706.  Id. Second, as the court note d, Title VII has long been construed\nliberally in favor of complainants. Id. at 1145. The court expressed concern\nthat \"allowing punitive and compensatory damages for class-wide claims and\nnot for pattern-or-practice claims, when both are equally severe in\nmagnitude, would disrupt Title VII's purpose to eradicate wid espread\ndiscrimination and to make persons whole again.\"  Id. (citing  Albemarle\nPaper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 417-18, 95  S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280\n(1975)). Third, the court found that ยง7 06 and ยง 707 claims are similar in that\n\"the interest in bringing a class action and/or a pattern-or-practice claim is\nthe same: to prevent against unlawfule mployment practices affecting a group\nof individuals with related claims.\"  Id. (citing Harriss v. Pan Am. Wo rld\nAirways, Inc., 74 F.R.D. 24, 41-42 (N.D. Cal. 1977);C herosky v. Henderson,\n330 F.3d 1243, 1247 (9th Cir. 2003)). The court concluded that \"[g]iven the\nsimilar nature of such claims and the remedial purpose of Title VII,\" there\nwas \"little legal or prudential reason to foreclose the EEOC from bringing a\npattern-or-practice claim pursuant to ยงยง 706 and 707 for the purpose of\nseeking punitive and compensatory damages.\" Id.\nOther courts have reached the contrary conclusion. Disagreeing with Scolari,\nthe District Court for the  Eastern Distrcit of Michigan insisted \"that allowing\npunitive and compensatory damages in  ยง 706, but not ยง 707, actions may\n'disrupt Title VII's purpose' is ... irre levantโ Congress apparently did not\nthink so, as the 1992 amendments to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981a  only extended\npunitive and compensatory damages to ยง 706 actions, not ยง 707 actions.\"\nSerrano v. Cintas Corp ., 711 F. Supp .2d 782, 793 (E.D. Mich.\n2010)(emphasis in original). That court went on to find that the EEOC could\nnot proceed solely under ยง 706, but reserved its \"judgment on the propriety\nof allowing the EEOC to 'blur the lines .'.. between the two statutory sections\"\nin cases where the  E EOC pursued both ยง 706 and ยง 707 actions\nsimultaneously. Id. at 794. Similarly, the Northern District of Iowa opined\nthat, \"[l]ike ยง 706, ยง 707 grants the EEOC the right to seek equitable relief\nagainst employers found to have intentionally engaged in a pattern or\npractice of unlawful employment discriminatio n.\" EEOC v. CRST Van\nExpedited, Inc., 611 F.Supp.2d 918, 930 (N.D. Iowa 2009)(citing 42 U.S.C. ยง\n2000e-6(a)). \"Unlike ยง 706, however, the EEOC is not authorized to seek\ncompensatory or punitive damages under ยง 707; the relevant portion of 42\nU.S.C. ยง 1981a only authorized recovery of compensa tory and punitive\n7\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 316   Filed 12/04/13   Page 8 of 11\ndamages '[i]n an action brought by a complaining party under [ยง 706].'\" Id.\n(citing 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981a(a)). The  CRST Van Expedited  court accused the\nEEOC of \"attempting to have its cake and eat it too\" by trying \"to avail itself\nof the Teamsters burden-shifting framework yet still seek compensatory and\npunitive damages under ยง 706.\" Id. at 934. \"Complicating matters further,\"\nthat court observed, \"it is important to remember that the Supreme Court\ndesigned the Teamsters burden-shifting framework with only equitable relief\nin mind.\" Id. (citing Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co., 130 F.3d 1287, 1290 n.4\n(8th Cir. 1997)). \nEEOC v. Bass Pro Outdoor World, LLC, 884 F. Supp. 2d 499, 519-20 (S.D. Tex. 2012).\nAfter considering the different approaches, the trial court in  EEOC v. Bass Pro\nOutdoor World, LLC held the EEOC could not bring a pattern or practice claim under ยง\n706. Id. at 520. However, the decision by the District Court for the Eastern District of\nMichigan in Serrano v. C intas, relied upon by the trial court in  Bass Pro, was later\noverturned by the Sixth Circuit. See Serrano v. Cintas Corp., 699 F.3d 884 (6th Cir. 2012),\ncert. denied, 187 L. Ed. 2d 254 (U.S. 2103). The Sixth Circuit inS errano held the EEOC may\npursue a pattern or practice claim under the Teamsters framework pursuant to its ยง 706\nauthority. Id. at  896. The Sixth Circuit noted that a reading of ยง 706 to allow Teamsters-\nlike pattern or practice claims migh t create some overlap with ยง 707.  Id. at 895-96.\nUltimately, however, the Sixth Circuit found the two statutes were not \"superfluous\" even\nif Teamsters applies to ยง 706 claims. Id. at 896.  The Sixth Circuit is the only circuit court\nto rule on this issue.  \nHaving considered the arguments of the pa rties and examined the case law, this\nCourt finds the Sixth Circuit decision in  Serrano v. Cintas persuasive and clarifies i ts\nAugust 19, 2013 Order and Reasons by speciyfing that the EEOC may bring its pattern and\npractice claims under both ยงยง 706 and 707 using the Teamsters framework and that both\n8\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 316   Filed 12/04/13   Page 9 of 11\nclaims will be tried in Phase I. The de cisions cited by the district court in Bass Pro were\ndecided before the Sixth Circuit's ruling inS errano. Furthermore, at least one other district\ncourt has followed Serrano and similarly found the EEOC has authority to bring a pattern\nor practice claim under ยง706. See e.g. EEOC v. Pitre, Inc., 908 F. Supp. 2d 1165 (D. N.M.\n2012) (finding a pattern or practice claim for sexual harassment could be brought under ยง\n706).25  \n(B) Jury Trial\nThe Court also clarifies its August 19, 2013 Order and Reasons by specifying that all\nthe EEOC's Phase I claims under  ยงยง 706 and 707 will be tried by a jur2y6 .The EEOC's ยง 706\nclaim seeks compensatory and puni tive damages recoverable under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981a.\nSection 1981a(c) expressly grants both plaintiff and defendant the right to demand a jury\ntrial when compensatory and punitive damages are sought in intentional discrimination\nclaims under Title VII. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981a(c). Although only prospective injunctive relief is\navailable at the successful conclusion of Phase  I, the trier of fact will determine factual\nissues that necessarily bear upon the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages in\nPhase II.  \"Once the right to a jury trial attaches to a claim ... it extends to all factual issues\nnecessary to resolving that claim.\" Allison v. Citgo Petroleum Corp., 151 F.3d 402, 423 (5th\nCir. 1998) (citing Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 510-11 (1959)).\n25Only one district court has appeared to limit the EEOC's authority to bring a pattern or practice\nclaim to ยง 707 after the Sixth Circuit holding in Serrano.  See EEOC v. JBS USA LLC, in which the District\nCourt of Nebraska found the EEOC could not pursue a  ยง 706 claim under the Teamsters framework. 2012\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 167117 (D. Neb. November 26, 2012). However, this Court does not find that decision\npersuasive. \n26Signal requested a jury in its answer to the EEOC's First Amended Complaint. (Doc. 199). \n9\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 316   Filed 12/04/13   Page 10 of 11\nII.  Phase II\n(A) Effect of Presumption from Phase I\nIf the EEOC is successful at the Phase I \"liability\" trial,P hase II will proceed with the\nindividual employees' entitlem ent to r elief for the proven discriminatory patterns or\npractices. Following Teamsters, the employees will enjoy an inference that \"any particular\nemployment decision, during the period in which the discriminatory policy was in force,\nwas made pursuant o f that policy.\"  Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 362. The Second Circuit in\nRobinson v. Metro-North Commuter R.R. explained the bifurcation model and the effects\nof the presumption:\nThe effect of the presumption from the alibility stage is to substantially lessen\neach class member's evidentiary burden relative to that which would be\nrequired if the employee were proceed ing separately with an individual\ndisparate treatment claim under theM  cDonnell Douglas framework. Rather\nthan having to make out a prima facie case of discrimination and prove that\nthe employer's asserted business justification is merely a pretext for\ndiscrimination, a class member at the remedial stage of a pattern or practice\nclaim need only show that he or shes uffered an adverse employment decision\nand therefore was a potential victim of the proved [class-wide]\ndiscrimination. The burden then shifts to the employer to demonstrate that\nthe individual [was subjected to thea dverse employment decision] for lawful\nreasons. If the employer is unable toe stablish a lawful reason for an adverse\nemployment action, the employee is en titled to individua lized equitable\nrelief, which may include back pay and front pay. Class members who seek\ncompensatory damages in addition to  individualized equitable relief must\nthen prove that the discrimination caused them emotional pain, suffering,\ninconvenience, mental a nguish, loss of enjoyment of life, [or] other\nnonpecuniary losses. \nRobinson,  267 F.3d 147, 159-60 (2d Cir. 2001)(niternal quotations and citations omitted). \nThe framework established in Robinson was also later adopted inE  EOC v. Sterling\nJewelers, Inc. 788 F. Supp. 2d 83 (W.D. N.Y. 2011). After a jury determines whether Signal\nengaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination in Phase I, Phase II will address issues\n10\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 316   Filed 12/04/13   Page 11 of 11\nconcerning each individual employees' claim for relief, including whether Signal can meet\nits burden of rebuttal as to e ach class member, and if not, the remedies to which each\nindividual employee is entitled, including  back pay, front pay, and compensatory and\npunitive damages. Id. at 92. \nIf the EEOC fails to prove a pattern or practice in Phase I, individuals may proceed\nunder the McDonnell Douglas model to prove each individual employee's entitlement to\ndamages based upon alleged discrimination, without the benefit of any presumption.\nSo Ordered this _4_th_ day of December, 2013.\n                                                            \n_____________________________               \n          SUSIE MORGAN\n                                     UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n11",

      "text": "Case 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 44   Filed 01/24/12   Page 1 of 7\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI\nSOUTHERN DIVISION\nEQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY\nCOMMISSION PLAINTIFF\nVERSUS  CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:11CV179-LG-RHW\nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL, LLC DEFENDANTS\nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO INTERVENE \nBefore the Court is a [2] Motion to Intervene filed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a) by\nSabulal Vijayan, Jacob Joseph Kadakkarappally, and Kurian David (Movants).  The instant\nlawsuit is a complaint filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against\nSignal International, LLC (Signal) alleging unlawful employment practices in violation of\nSection 703(a) and 704(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. ยงยง2000e-2(a) and 2000e-(3).  The EEOC filed\nthe complaint on April 20, 2011.  Movants filed the instant motion on May 6, 2011, seeking\nleave to file a complaint in intervention to participate in the original EEOC action. \nSignal opposes the motion to intervene on several grounds:  (1) the motion is premature\nand therefore not timely; (2) the intervention improperly seeks to change the nature of the case;\nand (3) Movant Kurian David should be excluded as an unnecessary party.\nRule 24(a) states in relevant part that\n[o]n timely motion, the court must permit anyone to intervene who: (1) is given an\nunconditional right to intervene by federal statute; or (2) claims an interest\nrelating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so\nsituated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the\nmovant's ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent\nthat interest.\nMovants have not identified a specific federal statutory right to intervene in the instant lawsuit. \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 44   Filed 01/24/12   Page 2 of 7\nHowever, there is case law suggesting such a statutory right.  See EEOC v. Wackenhut Corp., 939\nF.2d 241, 243 n.5 (5th Cir. 1991).  Regardless, the Court finds that the intervention should be\nallowed pursuant to Rule 24(a)(2).  A party seeking to intervene as of right pursuant to Rule\n24(a)(2) must satisfy four requirements: (1) the application must be timely; (2) the applicant must\nhave an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action; (3) the\napplicant must be so situated that the disposition of the action may, as a practical matter, impair\nor impede its ability to protect its interest; and (4) the applicantโs interest must be inadequately\nrepresented by the existing parties to the suit.  Sierra Club v. Espy, 18 F.3d 1202, 1204-05 (5th\nCir. 1994).    \n(1) Timeliness\nSignal argues that the intervention is untimely.  Generally, a timeliness argument is raised\nif the motion to intervene is perceived to be filed too late.  See e.g. In re Lease Oil Antitrust\nLitigation, 570 F.3d 244, 247-48 (5th Cir. 2009); Sierra Club, 18 F.3d at 1205.  Here, however,\nSignal argues that the intervention is premature.  The Fifth Circuit has cautioned against granting\npremature motions to intervene, because there may not be enough reliable information early in\nthe lawsuit to evaluate the motion.  See Stallworth v. Monsanto Co., 558 F.2d 257, 265 (5th Cir.\n1977).  To determine timeliness, the court must examine the following four factors: (1) the length\nof time between the intervenor learning of his interest and filing his motion; (2) the extent of\nprejudice that the existing parties may suffer due to the would-be intervenor's delay; (3) the\nextent of prejudice to the movant if his motion to intervene is denied; and (4) any unusual\ncircumstances which may sway the court one way or the other.  Id. at 264-66.\nThe first two factors do not appear to apply because they involve a delay in intervention. \n2\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 44   Filed 01/24/12   Page 3 of 7\nIn this case, the motion to intervene was filed 16 days after the complaint.  Although Movants\nseek to intervene early in the litigation process, the cause of intervention and basis for the lawsuit\nis well known to the parties by virtue of the EEOC complaint and investigation that pre-dated the\nlawsuit.  In fact two of the would-be intervenors, Vijayan and Kadakkarappally, were among\nthose who originally filed complaints with the EEOC alleging discrimination by Signal.  Even in\nthose cases where the Fifth Circuit has expressed concern about premature intervention and the\npotential waste of judicial resources, the Court has done so in the context of advocating leniency\nfor late intervenors.  See e.g. Espy, 18 F.3d at 1206-07; Stallworth, 558 F.2d at 266-67.  Signal\ndoes not assert any specific prejudice caused by early intervention.  Although Signal was\ncompelled as its first pleading in this Court to file a response in opposition to the motion to\nintervene, Signal has preserved its other rights by subsequently filing a motion for more definite\nstatement and motion to transfer venue. \nThere is significant potential of prejudice to the Movants if the motion to intervene is\ndenied.  The Movants have individualized claims for damages.  See American Assโn of Retired\nPersons v. Farmers Group, Inc., 943 F.2d 996, (9th Cir. 1991)(holding that private litigants are\nnot precluded from seeking individual damages in a separate lawsuit when EEOC has, in effect,\neschewed doing so).  Although the EEOC's litigation takes the interests of the charging parties\ninto account, it does not transfer all private enforcement to the EEOC.  See Gen. Tel. of NW v.\nEEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 326 (1980).  The EEOCโs complaint supplements, but does not replace, the\nprivate cause of action.  Id.  For example, if not allowed to intervene, the Movants will not be\nable to participate in the trial concerning any ruling by the court, nor will they be able to appeal\nany rulings by the court.  John Doe #1 v. Glickman, 256 F.3d 371, 379 (5th Cir. 2001). \n3\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 44   Filed 01/24/12   Page 4 of 7\nConsequently, the Movants interest in intervening is greater than any prejudice asserted by\nSignal.  \nSubsequent to Signal filing its opposition to the motion to intervene, the basis for its\nuntimeliness argument (i.e. the fact that it had not been served with the complaint) has been\nresolved.  The EEOC sent Signal a request for waiver of service on May 20, 2011, which Signal\nauthorized and executed on July 10, 2011.  Therefore, the timeliness argument lacks any practical\nsignificance at this point. \n(2) Intervention Changing the Nature of the Case\nSignal acknowledges that Vijayan and Kdakkarappally were claimants in the initial\nEEOC action, and as such, would have an absolute right to intervene on their own behalf in the\nEEOC's lawsuit.  Signal argues, however, that the motion to intervene changes the character of\nthe action.  It argues that the intervention expands the factual circumstances and claims beyond\nthe scope of the initial EEOC complaint.  Specifically, Signal argues that the allegations in the\nintervening complaint refer to activities that occurred outside of the United States and refer to\nrecruiters, fees, and attorneys not mentioned in the EEOC complaint. \nThe intervention rule is intended to prevent multiple lawsuits where common questions of\nlaw or fact are involved, but is not intended to allow the creation of whole new lawsuits by\nintervenors.  Deus v. Allstate Ins. Co., 15 F.3d 506, 525 (5th Cir. 1994).  The intervening party\nbecomes a โpartyโ for the purpose of protecting some right or interest.  Id.  With regard to EEOC\ncomplaints, the Fifth Circuit has held that their scope should not be interpreted strictly.  See\nSanchez v. Standard Brands, Inc., 431 F.2d 455, 465 (5th Cir. 1970).  In liberally construing the\nEEOC charge, the courtโs analysis \"looks beyond the four corners of the document to its\n4\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 44   Filed 01/24/12   Page 5 of 7\nsubstance.\"  McClain v. Lufkin Indus., 519 F.3d 264, 273 (5th Cir. 2008).\nThe EEOC complaint identifies the complainants as citizens of India whom Signal\nrecruited for employment in the United States and that the complainants โpaid large amounts of\nmoney for the job opportunity.โ  The fact that the Movantsโ proposed complaint goes into greater\ndetail about the recruitment activities and fees paid by them does not fundamentally alter the\nnature of the lawsuit.  Rather, a judicial complaint under Title VII is not limited to the verbatim\nwording of the administrative charge itself, but by the โscope of the EEOC investigation which\ncan reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.โ  Pacheco v. Norman,\n448 F.3d 783, 789 (5th Cir. 2006); see also McClain, 519 F.3d at 273.  The Court finds that the\nproposed intervention does not change the character of the lawsuit.  To the extent that it expands\nthe scope of the lawsuit, it does so in a manner that could be reasonably expected given the\nallegations in the underlying EEOC charge.  \n(3) Kurian Davidโs Intervention\nSignal also argues that Movant Kurian David should not be allowed to โpiggybackโ onto\nthe complaint.  Any similarly situated plaintiff is permitted to โopt-inโ to an EEOC complaint,\nprovided he or she meets certain criteria.  Anson v. Univ. of Tex. Health Science Ctr., 962 F.2d\n539, 541 (5th Cir. 1992); see Bettcher v. The Brown Schools, Inc., 262 F.3d 492, 493-94 (5th Cir.\n2001). \nFirst, the party must have been similarly situated to the party who filed the EEOC charge. \nBettcher, 262 F.3d at 494.  David was one of approximately 500 Indian employees affected by\nSignalโs alleged discrimination.  He worked and resided at Signalโs Texas facility.  While the\nother Movants were employed at the Mississippi facility, the alleged conditions and bases for\n5\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 44   Filed 01/24/12   Page 6 of 7\ndiscrimination are virtually identical.  Thus, the Court finds that David is similarly situated to the\nother Movants.\nSecond, the charges must have provided Defendant some notice of the collective or class-\nwide nature of the charge.  Id.  Signal knew from the outset of this complaint that the potential\nclass of employees was the 500 Indian citizens who received H-2B guest worker permits to work\nas welders and pipe fitters for Signal.  Not only was Signal aware of the class-wide nature of the\ndiscrimination complaint, it knew with substantial precision and specificity the identity of the\nclass members.\nFinally, piggybacking under the single filing ruling is available only if the person who\nfiled the EEOC charges has actually filed a lawsuit that the piggybacking plaintiff may join.  Id. \nIn this case, the plaintiffs upon whose claims David is piggybacking are his co-Movants for\nintervention.  Since the Court has concluded that the co-Movants (Vijayan and Kadakkarappally)\nshould be permitted to intervene in the EEOC complaint, David may in turn piggyback onto their\nlawsuit.  It would be a waste of time and judicial resources, as well as a triumph of form over\nsubstance, to require David to re-file his motion to intervene rather than allow his claim to\npiggyback with his co-Movants in a simultaneously filed motion.\nGiven the nearly identical factual circumstances and legal theories behind Davidโs\nintervention, the Court finds that he should be permitted to intervene, either as an intervention of\nright pursuant to Rule 24(a)(1) or (2), or by permissive joinder pursuant to Rule 24(b)(1)(B).  A\nfactor that would militate in favor of joinder pursuant to Rule 24(a)(2) is the fact that David\nworked in Signalโs Texas facility, rather than the Mississippi facility.  Consequently, David is so\nsituated that his interests might not be adequately protected by his co-Movants, who are litigating\n6\n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 44   Filed 01/24/12   Page 7 of 7\nregarding conditions at the Mississippi facility.  Regardless, David โhas a claim or defense that\nshares with the main action a common question of law or fact.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1)(B).  In\nfact, the questions of law and fact are nearly identical to those raised by Davidโs co-Movants. \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the [2] Motion to Intervene is\nGRANTED.   \nSO ORDERED, this the 24th day of January, 2012.\n(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:7)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:7)\ns/                               \nUNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE\n7",

Defendant Signal International, LLC (โSignalโ), a major Alabama, Mississippi, and \nTexas-based rig and ship fabrication and repair company, forced Plaintiff-Intervenors Sabulal \nVijayan, Jacob Joseph Kadakkarappally, and Kurian David (โPlaintiff-Intervenorsโ) and other \nIndian H-2B workers (โthe Indian Workersโ) to live in overcrowded, unsanitary, and guarded \nโman campsโ for which these workers paid dearly.  For a 6 foot by 3 foot top or bottom bunk \nwith barely enough headroom to sit up in a room shared with as many as 23 other men, which \nSignal itself acknowledged was not compliant with the requirements of the Occupational Safety \nand Health Act (โOSHAโ), and food prepared by an outfit that Signal management said would be \nshut down if the Health Department ever inspected it, Signal required the Plaintiff-Intervenors to \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 45   Filed 02/03/12   Page 2 of 23\npay astronomical rent -- $ 1,050 per month.  The Plaintiff-Intervenors, however, also paid with \ntheir health, their freedom, and their livelihoods.     \n2.  Among Signalโs many employees at its two production sites, only the Indian Workers \nwere required to pay these exorbitant rent charges and only the Indian Workers lived in the man \ncamps.  Signal specifically intended the man camps to be for Indians Workers only; segregated \nand isolated to such an extent that visitors โ be they close relatives, friends, language teachers, \nclergy, or legal services providers โ were not allowed to enter the compound.  Indeed, Defendant \nSignal would not have subjected, and did not subject, its non-Indian workforce to these \nconditions. \n3.  Plaintiff-Intervenors and the other Indian Workers arrived at Signal having paid as much \nas $20,000 to Signalโs labor recruiters and attorney.  To work at Signal, Plaintiff-Intervenors \nwere required to apply through these specific recruiters and attorney, and therefore they had no \nchoice but to pay these fees.  When some workers sought to come to Signal directly without \ngoing through these recruiters and this attorney, Signal refused to allow them to do so.  For the \nIndian Workers, fees of this size required selling possessions of value, mortgaging futures, and \nentering into desperate debt.  No non-Indian Signal employees were required to use a specific \nrecruiter, nor did any non-Indian Signal employees arrive at Signal having paid this amount of \nmoney to any recruiter.  \n4.  Signal also subjected the Plaintiff-Intervenors and others to abusive treatment based on \ntheir race and/or national origin.  Signal referred to Indian Workers by their Signal employee \nnumbers and not by their names.  Signal supervisors and management used derogatory language \nto demean the Plaintiffs-Intervenors and other Indian Workers, including referring to them as \nโthievesโ and โanimalsโ; telling them to โshut upโ when they raised complaints to Signal; saying \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 45   Filed 02/03/12   Page 3 of 23\nthat the man camps were better than the Indian Workersโ homes in India; and referring to Indian \nWorkers as โFโฆing Keralite,โ โrat[s],โ โchronic whiners,โ and โback-stabbing whining little \nbitches.โ  This race and national origin based treatment created a hostile work environment for \nthe Plaintiff-Intervenors and the other Indian Workers.   \n5.  Signal assigned Plaintiff-Intervenors to the most dangerous, difficult, and dirty jobs on \nthe rigs they were repairing, at times without adequate safety procedures in place.  Plaintiff-\nIntervenors believe they were assigned to these posts because of their race and national origin \nbecause few non-Indian Workers received such unwanted assignments.   \n6.  Plaintiff-Intervenors Sabulal Vijayan and Jacob Joseph Kadakkarappally complained to \nSignal management about these unwanted and unhealthful living and working conditions and \ntried to meet with other workers to coordinate a response.  After engaging in these activities, on \nMarch 9, 2007, Signal rounded them up in a public display designed to intimidate the other \nIndian workers, imprisoned Kadakkarappally in a guarded room to await forced deportation, and \nattempted to so detain Vijayan.  Only the attention of the media and the arrival of the local \npolice, along with a gathering of concerned supporters outside Signalโs gates and a suicide \nattempt by Vijayan, who decided he would rather die than be forced to return to his crippling \ndebt in India, thwarted the deportation.  In all, the March 9 incident โ which Signal itself has \nreferred to as โBlack Fridayโ โ was a flagrant effort to retaliate against Vijayan and \nKadakkarappally for complaining about Signalโs illegal, inhumane, and discriminatory treatment.      \n7.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (โEEOCโ) is a federal agency charged \nwith enforcing Title VII.  \nPlaintiffs-Intervenors \n11.  Plaintiff-Intervenor Sabulal Vijayan was recruited beginning in late 2003 from the United \nArab Emirates and India for work in the United States. Vijayan worked for Defendant Signal in \nPascagoula, Mississippi from late 2006 until Signal terminated his employment on March 9, \n2007.   \n12.  Vijayan filed a Charge of Discrimination with the EEOC on or around April 12, 2007.   \n13.  On or around September 14, 2009, the EEOC Area Director issued a Determination to \nVijayan finding reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant Signal (who was the Respondent \nto Vijayanโs Charges of Discrimination) violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \n14.  Plaintiff-Intervenor Jacob Joseph Kadakkarappally was recruited beginning in late 2003 \nfrom the United Arab Emirates and India for work in the United States. Kadakkarappally worked \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 45   Filed 02/03/12   Page 5 of 23\nfor Defendant Signal in Pascagoula, Mississippi from late 2006 until Signal terminated his \nemployment on March 9, 2007. \n15.  Kadakkarappally filed a Charge of Discrimination with the EEOC on or around April 12, \n2007. \n16.  On or around September 14, 2009, the EEOC Area Director issued a Determination to \nKadakkarappally finding reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant Signal (who was the \nRespondent to Kadakkarappallyโs Charges of Discrimination) violated Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. \n17.  Plaintiff-Intervenor Kurian David was recruited in 2006 from the United Arab Emirates \nand India for work in the United States.  After arriving in the United States in 2007, David \nworked at Signalโs Orange, Texas facility. \n18.  At all times relevant to this action, David was similarly situated to Plaintiff-Intervenors \nVijayan and Kadakkarappally and to the other Indian Workers. \n19.  Plaintiff-Intervenors and the other Indian Workers are of Asian race and are Indian \nnationals. \nDefendant \n20.  At all relevant times, Defendant Signal, a Delaware corporation, has been doing business \nin Pascagoula, Mississippi, and in Orange, Texas.  Signal is engaged in the business of building \nand repairing ships and off-shore oil rigs. \n21.  At all relevant times herein, Defendant Signal has continuously been an employer \nengaged in an industry affecting commerce within the meaning of ยง 701(b), (g) and (h) of Title \nVII, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-(b), (g) and (h). \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 45   Filed 02/03/12   Page 6 of 23\nTHE NATURE OF THE COMPLAINT \n22.  Defendant Signal, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, was unable to obtain a sufficient \nnumber of qualified and reliable pipe fitters and welders to meet the demands of its work load. \n23.  Defendant Signal, to meet this need, arranged to bring into the United States \napproximately 500 Indian men (the Indian Workers) through the federal governmentโs H-2B \nguestworker program.   \n24.  Defendant Signal entered into contracts with United States-based recruiter Michael Pol \nd/b/a Global Resources, Inc. (collectively โPolโ); United States-based attorney Malvern C. \nBurnett d/b/a Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, LLC and Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, \nA.P.C. (collectively โBurnettโ); and India-based recruiter Sachin Dewan d/b/a Dewan \nConsultants Pvt. Ltd a/k/a Medtech Consultants (collectively โDewanโ) (Pol, Burnett, and \nDewan collectively referred to as โthe Recruitersโ). \n25.  When Defendant Signal entered into a contract with the Recruiters in April 2006, the \nrepresentatives of Signal who executed the contract knew that Signal would not pay any \nrecruitment fee, service charge, transportation expense, visa issuance fee, legal fee, or any other \nfee, expense, charge or money whatsoever to the Recruiters for any part of the recruitment, \nprocessing, arrangement, or transportation of the Indian Workers. \n26.  At that time, the representatives of Signal who executed the contract knew that the Indian \nWorkers themselves would pay these fees, expenses, and charges to the Recruiters.   \n27.  The Indian Workers in fact each paid up to $20,000 U.S. Dollars to the Recruiters.  \nSpecifically, Plaintiff-Intervenor Vijayan paid approximately $12,670, Kadakkarappally paid \napproximately $13,226, and David paid approximately $13,000. \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 45   Filed 02/03/12   Page 7 of 23\n28.  At all relevant times, Signal would not accept Indian workers who did not use the \nRecruitersโ services.   \n29.  At all relevant times, the Recruiters acted as Signalโs agents and all actions the Recruiters \ntook during the recruitment process were with Signalโs express or implied authority.   \n30.  No welders or fitters directly employed by Signal, other than the Indian Workers, paid \nrecruitment fees in amounts comparable to the amounts the Indian Workers paid.   \n31.  Upon information and belief, no welders or fitters directly employed by Signal, other \nthan the Indian Workers, paid recruitment fees that exceeded a few hundred dollars.   \n32.  Upon information and belief, no welders or fitters directly employed by Signal, other \nthan the Indian Workers, began their employment in debt as a product of recruitment fees.   \n33.  No welders or fitters directly employed by Signal, other than the Indian Workers, were \nrequired to use the Recruiters, nor any particular recruiter, in order to obtain employment at \nSignal. \n34.  The Indian Workers were hired by Signal to provide labor and services at its Pascagoula, \nMississippi, and Orange, Texas, locations. \n35.  The first Indian Workers arrived in the end of October 2006.  Additional workers came to \nthe United States in groups of 30 to 50 workers at a time until approximately March 2007. \n36.  Signal brought over a total of just under 500 Indian Workers to the United States, sending \napproximately 288 workers to its facility in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and approximately 200 \nworkers to its facility in Orange, Texas. \n37.  At each location, the Indian Workers were required to live in modular trailers called \nโman camps.โ  Signal built the โman campsโ for the exclusive use of the Indian Workers.  No \nother Signal employees were required to live in the โman camps.โ  \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 45   Filed 02/03/12   Page 8 of 23\n38.  Before the Indian Workers were permitted to begin work, Signal required them to sign \nemployment and housing agreements. These agreements were written in English, few of the \nIndian Workers read or understood English well, and Signal did not give the Indian Workers \nadequate time to read or understand these documents. \n39.  One of these agreements allowed Signal to deduct $35 a day (or approximately $1050 per \nmonth) from each Indian Workerโs earnings to reimburse Signal for the cost of providing food, \naccommodations, and transportation for each such Indian Worker.  Under this agreement Signal \ncould continue to deduct this amount from the workerโs salary even if the Indian Worker elected \nnot to eat the meals provided by Signal and not to live in the accommodations provided by \nSignal.  These deductions also applied to days when for which the Indian Workers were not paid, \nsuch as holidays, sick days, weekends, and days with inclement weather where workers were \nunable to work. \n40.  The โman campsโ were located on Signal property in isolated, industrial areas miles \nremoved from shopping areas, places of worship, and residential communities.  The camps were \nenclosed by fences and accessible only through a single guarded entrance.  \n41.  Signal assigned numbers to each Indian Worker and used these numbers as a form of \nidentification and reference rather than using the employeeโs name. \n42.  Signal camp personnel and supervisors used offensive language in speaking with and/or \nreferring to the Indian Workers and insulted the Indian Workers on the basis of their race and/or \nnational origin.   \n43.  Signal guards monitored the comings and goings of the Indian Workers by requiring \nthem to show their employee identification badges.  Signal guards also searched the packages \nand bags of Indian Workers when they entered the camps. \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 45   Filed 02/03/12   Page 9 of 23\n44.  Except on rare occasions, the Indian Workers were not permitted to receive visitors in the \nโman camps.โ \n45.  The โman campsโ were composed of a series of one room trailers connected by elevated \nwalkways.  Most of the trailers were for sleeping and were referred to as โbunkhouses.โ  Up to \ntwenty-four men were housed in each bunkhouse, sleeping in two-tiered bunk beds.  The bunk \nbeds were so tightly packed in the bunkhouses that it was difficult for the Indian Workers to \nmove about in the narrow passageways between bunks.  Signal recognized that the bunkhouses \nwere not compliant with the requirements of OSHA and decided against making them OSHA \ncompliant by having fewer Indian Workers in each bunkhouse because doing so would be too \nโonerousโ for Signal. \n46.  The bunkhouses had insufficient toileting and bathing facilities for the twenty-four men.  \nThe Indian Workers were forced to rise early to take their place in line for the few toilets and \nshowers in each trailer. \n47.  Privacy was non-existent for the Indian Workers. The Indian Workers experienced \nextreme difficulty sleeping due to the constant noise resulting from the close quarters and the \ncomings and goings of workers who worked on different shifts but were housed closely together \nin the same bunkhouses.  Signal also had control over when the lights were turned on and when \nthe lights were turned off in the bunkhouses as even that decision was not left up to the Indian \nWorkers. \n48.  Signal personnel conducted surprise searches of the bunkhouses, including searches of \nthe Indian Workersโ personal belongings. \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 45   Filed 02/03/12   Page 10 of 23\n49.  The Indian Workers took their meals in mess halls which were part of the โman camps.โ  \nThe mess halls were only open during limited hours, set by Signal.  The food provided by Signal \nwas of poor quality and was frequently bad, stale or molded.  \n50.  As a result of unsanitary conditions, sickness was rampant in the camps, and the Indian \nWorkers sometimes required hospitalization.  \n51.  The โman campsโ had rules, enforced by Signal guards. The penalty for breaking rules \nwas $250 for the first violation and $500 for a second violation. \n52.  When the Indian Workers complained and asked to live outside the labor camps, Signal \ntold the workers that even if they lived outside the camps, Signal would continue to deduct the \n$35/day charge from the Indian Workersโ weekly wages.  As a result, the Indian Workers \nreasonably felt that they had no choice but to continue to live in the Signal โman camps.โ  No \nnon-Indian Signal employees who lived outside the camps had such deductions taken from their \nwages. \n53.  During the first two weeks of employing each Indian Worker, Signal also deducted \nbetween $100 and $200 a week from each employeeโs paycheck for tool kits which the Indian \nWorkers were required to purchase from Signal.  On information and belief, Signal did not \nrequire non-Indian workers to buy tools from Signal.    \n54.  Vijayan and Kadakkarappally routinely complained to Signal, on behalf of themselves \nand the other Indian Workers, about the food, living conditions, camp facilities, camp rules, and \nterms and conditions of employment at Signal. Vijayan and Kadakkarappally frequently met \nwith fellow Indian Workers to learn of their concerns relating to the conditions under which they \nwere forced to work by Signal. \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 45   Filed 02/03/12   Page 11 of 23\n55.  In response to these complaints, Signal personnel warned the Indian Workers to stop \ncomplaining. Signal personnel and management regularly threatened the Indian Workers that if \nthey did not continue working for Signal or did not work to Signalโs specifications, they would \nbe deported to India. \n56.  After Signal ignored the Indian Workersโ complaints regarding housing, food, and terms \nand conditions of employment, the Indian Workers living in the Pascagoula โman campโ \ncontinued meeting to discuss how to persuade Signal to improve the working conditions of the \nIndian Workers. \n57.  On or about March 4, 2007, Vijayan, Kadakkarappally, and other Indian workers met \nwith attorneys in a church near the Pascagoula facility. The purpose of this meeting was to \ndiscuss their rights as employees of Signal.   \n58.  Signal learned of the aforementioned meeting held on or about March 4, 2007. The \nrecruiting agent Signal used in India, Sachin Dewan, called Vijayanโs wife at her home in India \nand warned her that Vijayan must stop making complaints about Signal or Signal would return \nthe Indian Workers to India.  Vijayanโs wife informed Vijayan of this call.  \n59.  Vijayan informed the other Indian Workers about the call which his wife had received \nand word spread quickly through the Pascagoula and Orange camps regarding the threats against \nVijayan. \n60.  Vijayan and Kadakkarappally took leading roles in gathering information and voicing the \ncomplaints of the other Indian Workers to Signal.  \n61.  Signal called a meeting of the Indian Workers on or about March 8, 2007.  At this \nmeeting, Signal management told the Indian Workers that Signal would fight back against any \norganizing efforts by the workers and that if Indian Workers brought any legal action against \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 45   Filed 02/03/12   Page 12 of 23\nSignal, Signal would not extend any of the Indian Workersโ H-2B visas, despite Signalโs \nprevious promises of extensions.     \n62.  The next morning, March 9, 2007, Signal locked the gate to the Pascagoula โman campโ, \nthereby obstructing the sole means of direct entry to and exit from the camp.  Signal camp \ncoordinator Darrell Snyder and approximately five security guards then swept through the \nbunkhouses carrying pictures of Vijayan, Kadakkarappally and other Indian Workers. \n63.       Shortly after 5:00 a.m. on March 9, 2007, Signal forcibly transported Vijayan, \nKadakkarappally and three other Indian Workers from their bunkhouse to another trailer used as \na TV room.  Signalโs plan was to keep these employees in the room, to discharge them from \nemployment, and then to transport them to the airport for immediate return to India.  Signalโs \nplan was altered with regard to Vijayan because he attempted suicide by cutting his wrist. The \nother workers were placed in the TV room and kept there by guards who had instructions from \nSignal not to let the workers leave the room. \n64.  On March 9, 2007, Signal discharged Vijayan and Kadakkarappally because of their \ncomplaints, organizing efforts, and discussions of discriminatory terms and conditions of \nemployment. \n65.  Starting with the mandatory use of the Recruiters and continuing until the employment of \nall Indian Workers ceased,  Signal subjected such employees to terms and conditions of \nemployment that were less favorable than those enjoyed by their non-Indian counterparts.  \n66.  This unequal treatment included, but was not limited to, Indian Workers being assigned \nthe most undesirable work at the facilities which non-Indian Workers were not asked to perform, \nharassment and insults based on the workersโ race and national origin, mandatory subjection to \ninferior living conditions in the man camps where no non-Indian workers were required to live, \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 45   Filed 02/03/12   Page 13 of 23\nmandatory rent and meal deductions, mandatory use of the Recruiters who required payment of \nhigh recruitment fees, and other disparate terms and conditions of employment.  \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n67.  Claims for damages for Signalโs violations of Title VII contained in Counts I, II, and IV \nare brought by the Plaintiff-Intervenors on behalf of themselves and all similarly situated persons \npursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   \n68.  Class claims for compensatory and punitive damages are brought pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(a) and 23(b)(3). For the purposes of compensatory and punitive damages, the class consists \nof all Indian Workers who paid recruitment fees and/or other amounts to the Recruiters, and who \nwere employed by Signal at any time in 2006, 2007, and/or 2008. \nRule 23(a) \n69.  The precise number of individuals in the class is known only to Signal, but the class is \nbelieved to include approximately 500 individuals.  Because of the number of class members and \nbecause the class members are foreign nationals and migrant workers, joinder of all class \nmembers is impracticable. \n70.  This action involves questions of law common to the class, including, but not limited to: \na.  Whether Signalโs conduct as set forth in Counts I, II, and IV violated Title VII of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964; and \nb.  The nature of damages available to Plaintiff-Intervenors and other class members, \nincluding the applicability of compensatory and/or punitive damages. \n71.        This action involves questions of fact common to the class, including but not limited to: \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 45   Filed 02/03/12   Page 14 of 23\na.  Whether Signal treated the Indian Workers differently from their non-Indian \nemployees by requiring them to pay 35 dollars per day to live in the man camps \ndescribed herein; \nb.  Whether Signal treated the Indian Workers differently from their non-Indian \nemployees by requiring the Indian Workers to obtain employment at Signal \nthrough the Recruiters, who charged exorbitant recruitment fees; \nc.  Whether Signal treated the Indian Workers differently from their non-Indian \nemployees by assigning the Indian Workers to the least desirable jobs; and \nd.  Whether Signal created a hostile work environment for the Indian Workers by \nsubjecting them to slurs and epithets based on the Indian Workersโ race and \nnational origin.   \n72.        The claims of the Plaintiff-Intervenors asserted in Counts I, II, and IV are typical of the \nclaims of the class. \n73.        The Plaintiff-Intervenors will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \n74.        Counsel for the Plaintiff-Intervenors are experienced in handling class action litigation \non behalf of migrant workers like Plaintiff-Intervenors and are prepared to advance the costs \nnecessary to vigorously litigate this action. \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 45   Filed 02/03/12   Page 15 of 23\nRule 23(b)(3) \n75.        Common questions of law and fact relevant to Counts I, II, and IV, as identified above, \npredominate over any pertinent questions involving only individual class members. \n76.        A class action is superior to other available methods of adjudicating the claims set forth \nin Counts I, II, and IV because, inter alia: \na.  Common issues of law and fact, as identified in part above, substantially diminish \nthe interest of class members in individually controlling the prosecution of \nseparate actions; \nb.  The class members are foreign nationals and migrant workers who lack the means \nand/or resources to secure individual legal assistance, and are particularly likely to \nbe unaware of their rights to prosecute these claims; and \nc.  A class action can be managed with efficiency and without undue difficulty \nbecause Signal has systematically and regularly committed the violations \ncomplained of herein and has used standardized recordkeeping and employment \npractices throughout the time period at issue. \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 45   Filed 02/03/12   Page 16 of 23\nCOUNT I \n \n[Title VII Hostile Work Environment Based on National Origin/Race] \n[Class Claim] \n77.  Plaintiff-Intervenors incorporate and reassert the aforementioned paragraphs 10 through \n76 of this Complaint in Intervention. \n78.  Since at least October 2006, Signal has engaged in unlawful employment practices at \ntheir Pascagoula and Orange locations in violation of ยง 703(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-\n2(a), including subjecting the Plaintiff-Intervenors and other Indian Workers to a hostile work \nenvironment based on race and/or national origin.    \n79.  Signal created and perpetuated a hostile work environment against the Plaintiff-\nIntervenors and other Indian Workers based on their race and/or national origin. Signalโs \nsupervisors and managers made offensive and unwanted derogatory comments about the \nPlaintiff-Intervenors and other Indian Workers and engaged in a series of demeaning and \ndiscriminatory actions, specifically directed solely at the Plaintiff-Intervenors and other Indian \nWorkers based on their race and/or national origin.   \n80.  Signalโs conduct was offensive, severe, unwelcome and pervasive and interfered with the \nIndian Workersโ working conditions. Signal subjected the Plaintiff-Intervenors and other Indian \nWorkers to a hostile work environment, which included but was not limited to:   \na.  Calling the Indian Workers insulting and offensive comments based on their race \nand/or national origin; \nb.  Calling the Indian Workers โthievesโ and โanimalsโ; \nc.  Telling Indian Workers to โshut upโ when Indian Workers raised complaints to \nSignal; \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 45   Filed 02/03/12   Page 17 of 23\nd.

Referring to the Indian Workers as โFโฆing Keraliteโ, โrat[s]โ, โchronic whinersโ, \nand โback-stabbing whining little bitchesโ. \n81.  The hostile environment that existed at Signal facilities was created and perpetuated at \nthe direction of Signalโs management and supervisory personnel with direct supervisory and/or \nmanagerial authority over the Plaintiff-Intervenors and other Indian Workers. \n82.  The unlawful hostile environment occurred with the full knowledge of Signalโs \nmanagement and supervisory personnel, and Signal failed to exercise reasonable care either to \nprevent the creation of this hostile environment or to correct promptly the hostile environment \nonce it existed. \n83.  The unlawful employment practices complained of in the aforementioned paragraphs 10 \nthrough 82 were intentional, and done with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally \nprotected rights of Vijayan, Kadakkarappally, David, and similarly situated Indian Workers.  \n84.  The effect of the intentional practices complained of in aforementioned paragraphs 10 \nthrough 83 has been to deprive Vijayan, Kadakkarappally, David and similarly situated Indian \nWorkers of equal employment opportunities and otherwise adversely affect their status as \nemployees because of their race and/or national origin. \n \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 45   Filed 02/03/12   Page 18 of 23\nCOUNT II \n \n[Title VII National Origin/Race Discrimination: \nEmployment Terms & Conditions] \n \n[Class Claim] \n \n85.

Starting with the mandatory use of the Recruiters by all Indian Workers, and continuing \nuntil the employment of all Indian Workers ceased, Signal subjected such employees to terms \nand conditions of employment that were less favorable than enjoyed by their non-Indian \ncounterparts. These employment practices violated ยง 702(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(a). \n87.  This unequal treatment included but was not limited to  \na.

Vijayan and Kadakkarappally, on behalf of themselves and the other Indian Workers, \nopposed Signalโs discriminatory treatment of the Indian Workers. Signal was aware of this \nopposition on the part of Vijayan and Kadakkarappally. As set forth in detail in the preceding \nparagraphs of this Complaint in Intervention, Signal retaliated against Vijayan and \nKadakkarappally by increasing the severity of the discriminatory terms and conditions of their \nemployment, and, on March 9, 2007, forcibly detaining them against their will and discharging \nthem from employment because they opposed Signalโs discriminatory treatment of the Indian \nWorkers.  \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:12-cv-00557-SM-DEK   Document 45   Filed 02/03/12   Page 20 of 23\n93.

For\nthe reasons set forth below, the EEOCโs motion is granted in part and denied in part.\nOne of the EEOCโs specific prayers for relief in its motion is for an order directing\n1 R. Doc. 192.\n2 R. Doc. 193.\n3 R. Doc. 195.\n1\n\nSignal to file an answer to the EEOCโs amended complaint within ten days.4  In response,\nSignal explains that it will file its answer โon or before June 3, 2013.โ5  Accordingly, to the\nextent the EEOCโs motion seeks an order directing Signal to answer the EEOCโs amended\ncomplaint within a certain time frame, IT IS ORDERED that the motion be and hereby\nis GRANTED.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED  that Signal shall filed an answer to the EEOCโs\namended complaint on or before June 3, 2013.\nThe Court now turns to the EEOCโs genera l prayer that the Court โi mmediately\nrelease [the EEOC matter] from any affiliation with David [v. Signal International, LLC,\nCivil Action No. 08-1220], and allow [the  EEOC] to proceed with Phase I discovery and\nlitigation,โ and the following specific prayers:( 1) that the Court order Signal to produce the\nidentity of the persons and entities identified in interrogatories propounded on Signal by\nthe EEOC;6 (2) that the Court authorize the EEOCโiss suance of Third-Party Subpoenas; (3)\nthat the Court order the parties to participate in a Rule 26(f) Conference and file a Joint\nCase Management Order, and to exchange Initial Disclosures no later than 14 days after the\nRule 26(f) Conference; and (4) that the Court order that the parties file a Joint Protective\nOrder governing the handling of confidential information.\nJudge Zainey denied Signalโs motion to consolidate the EEOC case and the David\ncase while this case was pending before Section โAโ of this Court.7  As a result, while the\n4 See R. Doc. 153.\n5 R. Doc. 195 at p. 2.\n6 See R. Doc. 192-3.\n7 R. Doc. 93.\n2\n\ncases are clearly related, they are not formally consolidated.  It is not clear that the EEOC\nis referring to when it references โaffiliationโ of this case with the David case.  Affiliation\nis not a term in the Federal Rules,  and there is no order in the record affiliating the two\ncases.  Instead, they are โrelated cases,โ and that is how they are designated in the caption. \nAccordingly, to the extent the EEOCโs motion eseks an order โreleasing its lawsuit from any\naffiliation with David,โ IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the motion be and hereby is\nDENIED AS MOOT.\nThe Court agrees with the EEOC, however, that the EEOC should b e allowed to\nproceed with discovery in its case against Signailn  an effort to movet he case towards a final\nresolution.  Despite Signalโs arguments to the contrary, there is no valid reason why the\nEEOC case should not move forward, and, to accomplish this goal, Signal must engage in\nmeaningful discovery with the EEOC and plaintiff-intervenors.\nAccordingly, to the extent the EEOCโs motion seeks an order allowing the EEOC to\nproceed with discovery, IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the motion be and hereby is\nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\nSpecifically, to the extent the EEOCโs motion seeks (1) an order directing Signal to\nproduce to the EEOC, no later than fifteen (15) days after the entry of this Order, the\nidentity of the persons and entities identified in the interrogatories propounded on Signal\nby the EEOC; (2) an order authorizing EEO C's issuance of Third-Party Subpoenas,\neffective immediately; (3) an order directing the parties to participate in a Rule 26(f)\nConference no later than twenty (20) days after the entry of this Order and to exchange\nInitial Disclosures no later thanf ourteen (14) days after the Rule 26(f) Conference; and\n(4) an order directing the parties to file a Joint Protective Order, or separate proposals if\n3\n\nno agreement can be reached, governing the handling of confidential information no later\nthan thirty (30) days after the entry of this Order, IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that\nthe EEOCโs motion be and hereby is GRANTED.\nFinally, the EEOCโs request for an order rqeuiring the parties to develop and submit\na joint case ma nagement order is contingent in part upon the Courtโs resolution of the\nEEOCโs pending motion to bifurcate the trial of this matter8.  Accordingly, to the extent the\nEEOCโs motion seeks an order requiring the parties to file a joint case management order,\nthe EEOCโs motion is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.  The Court will deal with the\ncase management order issue in the context of the EEOCโs motion to bifurcate.\nNew Orleans, Louisiana, this _3_rd_ day of June, 2013.\n_____________________________\n       SUSIE MORGAN\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\nCourt to Notify:\nMagistrate Judge Daniel E.

Signal\nInternational (Civil Action No. 12-557) (โEEOCโ)\nORDER AND REASONS\nBefore the Court is plaintiff Equal Employment Opportunity Commissionโs (โthe\nEEOCโ or โthe Commissionโ) โMotion to Bifurcate Trial and Discover y.โ1  P laintiff-\nintervenors (\"the Intervenors\") support the EEOCโs motion. 2  Defendant Sig nal\nInternational, LLC (โSignalโ) opposes the EEOCโs motion3.  The EEOC has also filed a reply\nin further support of its motion to bifurcate4 and a notice of supplemental authority.5  For\n1 R. Doc. 141.\n2 R. Doc. 149.\n3 R. Doc. 150.\n4 R. Doc. 160.\n5 R. Doc. 183.\n1\n\nthe reasons set forth below, the EEOCโs motion to bifurcate is granted in part and denied\nin part.\nI.  THE EEOC'S CLAIMS\nThe EEOC asserts four bases for its claims for relief against Signal in this case:6 \n(1)  that Signal โcreated and perpetuated a hostile work environment,โi n\nviolation of ยง 703(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (โTitle\nVIIโ), codified at 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(a);\n(2)  that Signal subjected certain employees to terms and conditions  of\nemployment that were less favorabel than enjoyed by other employees,\nin violation of ยง 703(a) of Title VII, codified at 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(a);\n(3)  that Signal retaliate d against specific employees who  complained\nabout Signalโs employment practices, in violation of ยง 704(a) of Title\nVII, codified at 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-3(a); and\n(4)  that Signal โengaged in a pattern or practice of subjecting its Indian\nEmployees to a host ile environment and disparate terms and\nconditions of employment based on their race and national origin,โ in\nviolation of ยง 706(f)(1), ยง 706(f)(3), and ยง 707 of Title VII, codified at\n42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-5(f)(1), 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-5(f)(3), and 42 U.S.C. ยง\n2000e-6, respectively.\nII. BIFURCATION  GENERALLY\n6 See R. Doc. 153 (the EEOCโs amended complaint).  While this amended complaint was filed after\nthe motion to bifurcate now before the Court, the amendments were, in large part, technical, and have no\nsubstantive effect on the Courtโs resolution of the motion to bifurcate.  Indeed, in the motion to bifurcate,\nthe EEOC noted the amendment to correct a citation.  See R. Doc. 141-1 at p. 6 n. 4.\n2\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Proce dure 42(b) provides that โ[f]or convenience, to avoid\nprejudice, or to expedite and economize, thec ourt may order a separate trial of one or more\nseparate issues, claims, crossclaims, counterclaims, or third-party claims.โ  FED. R. CIV. P.\n42(b).  The decision to bifurcate pursuant to this rule is left to the discretion of the district\ncourt.  See, e.g., Malin Intern. Ship Repair and Drydock, Inc. v. Veolia Es Special Servs.,\nInc., 369 F. Appโx 553, 555 (5th Cir. 2010) (unpublished).\nIII. PHASE  I\nThe Court agrees that bifurcation of the case for discovery and trial is appropriate\nwith respect to the EEOC's pattern or practice claim for disparate treatment as bifurcation\nwill aid in the swift and efficient resolution o fthese claims.  The Court declines to bifurcate\nthe EEOC's pattern or practice hostile work environment claim because of the subjective\nnature of the proof required.  See EEOC v. Mitsubishi Motor Mfg. of Am. , 990 F. Supp.\n1059, 1078-79 (C.D. Ill. 1998);J  enson v. Eveleth Taconite Company, 824 F. Supp. 847, 875\n(D. Minn. 1993); EEOC v. JBS United States, LLC, 2011 LEXIS 87127, at *17 (D. Colo. Aug.\n8, 2011). \nLiability and injunctive relief under th e EEOC's pattern or practice claim for\ndisparate treatment to be litigated  in Phaes I will proceed under the framework the United\nStates Supreme Court delineated in  International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United\nStates, 431 U.S. 324 (1997).  Should the trier o f fact find liability regarding the EEOC's\npattern or practice claim in Phase I, appropraite prospective injunctive relief will be decided\nby the Court.  Post-trial briefing concerningt he appropriateness and type of injunctive and\nequitable relief will be allowed.\nIV. Phase II\n3\n\nThe remaining claims asserted by the  EEOC and all claims asserted by the\nIntervenors will be tried in Phase II, including punitive damages.  The Supreme Court has\nmade it clear that any punitive damages determination must be \"reasonable and\nproportionate\" to the amount of actual (i.e. compensatory) damages.   State Farm Mut. \nAuto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell,  538 U.S. 408, 426  (2003).  Further, it would be unfair to ask\na jury to determine punitive damages against an employer without determining how many\nindividual employees were actually negative ly impacted by the alleged discriminatory\nconduct. See Phillip Morris USA v. Williams , 549 U.S. 346, 354 (2007). The EEOC's\nproposal that the jury in Phase I determine punitive damages runs afoul of the principles\narticulated in bothS  tate Farm and Philip Morris.  This Court must follow the Fifth Circuit's\nreasoning in Allison v. Citgo, 151 F.3d 402 (5th Cir. 1998), which rejected the idea that\npunitive damages should be assessed on a classw- ide basis at the conclusion of the liability\nphase:\nPunitive damages cannot be assessed  merely upon a finding that the\ndefendant engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination.  Such a\nfinding establishes only that there has been general harm to the group and\nthat injunctive relief is appropriate.S  ee Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490\nU.S. 228, 266 (1989) (O'Connor, J., concurring in the ju dgment). Actual\nliability to individual class members, and their entitlement to moneta ry\nrelief, are not determined until the second stage of the trial. See id.; Dillon\nv. Coles, 746 F.2d 998, 1004 (3d Cir. 1984). And because punitive damages\nmust be reasonably related to the  reprehensibility of the defendant's\nconduct and to the compensatory damages awa rded to the plaintiffs,\nrecovery of punitive damages must necessa rily turn on the recovery of\ncompensatory damages.\nId. at 417.  \nHandling punitive damages in Phase II will allow the jury to make the fact-specific\ndeterminations necessary for each claimant. See EEOC v. Int'l Profit Assocs., 2007 LEXIS\n4\n\n78378 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 23, 2007). \nV. CONCLUSION\nAccordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the EEOCโs motion to bifurcate be and hereby\nis GRANTED IN PART but DENIED to the extent it seeks a determination of its hostile\nwork environment pattern or practice claim and its punitive damages claim in Phase I.\nIn a previous motion, the EEOC requested an order requiring the parties to develop\nand submit a joint case management order in this case. 7  Because that request was\ncontingent in part upon the Courtโs resolution of the instant motion to bifurcate the trial\nof this matter, the Court denied the EEOCโs reqeust and informed the parties that this issue\nwould be revisited when the Court resolved the motion to bifurcate.8  \nThe Court notes there is a pending motio nfor partial dismissal filed by Signal.9  That\nmotion relates only to the recruitment clai m filed by the Intervenors and the motion's\nresolution, even if granted, will not defeat alcl laims filed by the Intervenors.  The pendency\nof this claim does not affect the parti es' ability to craft a case management order with\nrespect to all other claims. \nThe Court order s the EEOC to submit a proposed Discovery Plan and Case\nManagement Order (\"DPCMO\"), and a memorandum in support of its proposal, for Phase\nI and Phase II within fourteen (14) days of this Order. The DPCMO shall cover all topics\nnecessary for the orderly preparation for and tiral of Phase I and Phaes II, including but not\nlimited to the following topics:  the discovery t obe taken in each phase, including any issues\n7 R. Doc. 192.\n8 R. Doc. 198.\n9See R. Doc. 184 (motion to dismiss). \n5\n\nregarding discovery of electronically stored information and coordination of discovery with\nthe David case; the claims to be tried in each phase (in accordance with this Order), with\nstatutory citations for the basis for each claim; the identities of the claimant(s) for each\nclaim in each phase; the elements of, and the burden of proof to be applied to, each claim\nin each phase;10  the presumptions or inferences resulting from any previous findings; the\naffirmative defenses available with respect to each claim in each phase; the effect of any\npattern or practice finding in Phase I on individual claims in Phase II; the relief requested\nfor each claim in each phase; the time needed for trial of each phase; and suggested dates\nfor the pre-trial conference and trial of each phase. The EEOC is instructed to confer with\nthe Intervenors and Signal in an attempt to resolve as many issues regarding the DPCMO\nas possible prior to the filing of the EEOC's porposed DPCMO.  In the event that agreement\nis not reached on all issue s, Signal and the Intervenors shall file their objections to the\nproposed DPCMO, and supporting memorand um, and their counter-proposals, withi n\nseven (7) days of the filing of the EEOC proposal.\nAfter consideration of the parties' proposals and memoranda, the Court will enter\na DPCMO for Phase I and Phase II.  The Court is mindful of the fact that adjustments will\nlikely be necessary as the case progresse s but fi nds it desirable for the orderly\nadministration of this case for a DPCMO to be entered at this time.  \n19th\nNew Orleans, Louisiana, this ___ day of August, 2013.\n_____________________________\n       SUSIE MORGAN\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n10The EEOC has stipulated that its pattern or practice claims are to be decided   within the\nframework the United States Supreme Court delineated in International Brotherhood of Teamsters v.\nUnited States, 431 U.S. 324 (1997).\n6\n\nCourt to Notify:\nMagistrate Judge Daniel E.

Signal (13-6218, 13-6219, 13-6220, 13-6221, 14-732) \n     \n   \nORDER AND REASONS \n  Before the Court is a Motion to Certify  for Interlocutory Appeal or Alternatively \nto Stay P ending Application for Mandamus Relie f filed by Defendants Signal \n1 \n \n\nInternational, L.L.C., Signal International, Inc., and Signal Inter national Texas, G.P. \n(collectively \"Signal\") .1  Defendants Malvern Burnett, the Law Offices of Malver n \nBurnett, A.P.C., and Gulf Coast Immigr ation Law Center, L.L.C. (the \"Burnett \nDefendants\") have filed a similar Motion.2  The question presented is whether the Court \nshould certify for int erlocutory appeal its  orders prohibiting th e discovery of certain \npost-Signal information, including immigration status.  For the fo llowing reasons, the  \nCourt finds that the  criteria for interlocutory appeal are not present and that a  \ndiscretionary stay pe nding the outcome of a petition for mandamus relief is not \nwarranted.  The Motions are DENIED. \nBACKGROUND3 \n   A protective order in the above-caption ed matters prohibits Signal from \ndiscovering,  inter alia , the current immigration status of any plaintiff, the curren t \naddress or place of residence of any plaintiff, and the employers or potential employers \nof any plaintiff post-termination of employment with Signal.4 Moving Defendants argue \nthe protective order u nduly restricts their  ability to discover impeachment evidence. 5  \nThe Court has rejected this argument on multiple occasions, finding t hat the  in \nterrorem effect of producing the requested information outweighs Signal's interest in  \nunbridled discovery.  Recognizing the futi lity of beating a dead hor se, Moving  \nDefendants now ask the Court to certify its  orders upholding the protective order for  \n                                                             \n1 R. Doc. 1776 in the David Case, R. Doc. 472 in the EEOC Case, and R. Doc. 351 in the Achari Cases. \n2 R. Doc. 1808 in the David  Case and R.  Doc. 384 in  the Achari Cases.  The Bur nett Defendants \nincorporate by reference the arguments set forth in Signal's motion. \n3 The facts of the related cases have been detailed ad nauseum in previous orders.  Familiarity is assumed. \n4 R. Docs. 367 and 476 in the David Case, R. Doc. 285 in the EEOC Case, and R. Doc. 307 in the Achari \nCases. \n5 The Burnett Defendants also argue the protect ive order precludes them from assessing the economic \nharm, if any, suffered by the plaintiffs. \n2 \n \n\ninterlocutory appeal.  In the alternative, Moving Defendants request a discretionary stay \nof the above-captioned matters while they petition the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for  \na writ of mandamus. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n  An interlocutory appeal from a non-final order in a civil case is permissible when \n(1) the order involves \"a controlling question of law,\" (2) there is \"substantial ground for \ndifference of opinion\" on the question pres ented, and (3) an immediate ap peal would \n\"materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\" 6  The district court  \ncannot certify an order for interlocutory appe al unless all three criteria are present.7  In \ndetermining whether certification is appropriate, the Court is mindful that interlocutory \nappeal is \"exceptional \" and \"does not lie  simply to determine t he correct ness of a  \njudgment.\"8   \nLAW AND ANALYSIS \n  The partie s spill much ink arguing wh ether the protective or der involves a \ncontrolling question of law on which there ex ists a substantial ground for difference of \nopinion.  The Court need not decide these issues today.  For the reasons explained more \nfully below, certification is not warranted because an immediate appeal would hinderโ\nrather than hastenโthe ultimate termination of the related cases.   \n  An immediate appeal materially advances the termination of litigation if it would \neliminate t he need for trial, simplify the i ssues for  trial, or reduce the burden of \n                                                             \n6 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(b). \n7 See Aparicio v.  Swan Lake, 643 F.2d 1109, 1110 n.2 (5th Cir.  1981) (\"Section 1292(b) sets out three \ncriteria all of which must be met before the district court may properly certify an interlocutory order for \nappeal.\") (emphasis added). \n8 Clark-Dietz & Assocs.-Eng'rs, Inc. v. Basic Constr. Co., 702 F.2d 67, 68โ69 (5th Cir. 1983). \n3 \n \n\ndiscovery.9  Certification of the protective order would accomplish none  of these  \nobjectives.10  As a non-dispositive order, the revers al or affirmance of a discovery order \nwould seldom (if ever) eliminate the need for trial.   Nor would a decision from the Fifth \nCircuit simplify the issues for trial or redu ce the burden of dis covery.  If anything, \nvacature of the protective order would make discovery even more onerous and unwieldy.   \n  Rather than expediting a final disposition, an interlocutory appeal would actually \ndelay resolution of the related cases.  The  David Case is set for trial in less than three \nmonths.  Even if the Fifth Circuit chose to  hear the interlocutory appeal, the parties \ncould not realistically expect a decision for at least six months.11  Regardless of the Fifth \nCircuit's ruling, the  David Case would the n have to be  returned to the Court's jur y \ndocket, resulting in an addition al lengthy de lay.  Moreover, an extensive delay in the \nDavid Case would likely produce a ripple effect of con tinuances in the  EEOC Case and \nthe Achari Cases.  A nd once the  David Case and the related cases are finally tried, \nappealable issues will almost undoubtedly still exist, 12 which co uld lead to another  \nround of appeals and remands.13   \n                                                             \n9 B&B Advisory Servs., LLC v. Bombardier Aerospace Corp., No. Civ. A. 02-2695, 2003 WL 22326511, at \n*2 (E.D. La. Oct. 9, 2003); see also Panda Energy Int'l, Inc. v. Factory Mut. Ins., Nos. 3:11โCVโ003โK, \n3:10โCVโ2541โK, No. 09โ30453 (SGJ), and No. 09โ30453 (SGJ), 2011 WL 610016, at *5 (N.D. Tex. Feb. \n14, 2011) (\"An appeal materially adva nces the termination of litigation when it accelerates or simplifies \ntrial proceedings.\"). \n10 Courts i n the Fifth C ircuit ha ve recogniz ed  that a dis covery order is s eldom appropriate for \ninterlocutory appeal.  See, e.g., In re Tullius, No. EP-11-mc-365-KC., 2011 WL 5006673, at *2 (W.D. Tex. \nOct. 20, 2011) (\"District courts in the Fifth Circuit are hesitant to grant leave to appeal  interlocutory \norders relating to discovery.\"); Decena v. Am. Int'l Cos. (AIG), No. 11-1574, 2012 WL 1640455, at *2 (E.D. \nLa. May 9, 2o12) (\"As several courts have recognized, pretrial discovery orders will seldom meet the \nrequirements for interlocutory appeal.\"). \n11 As the David Plaintiffs note in their opposition memorandum, the average time for disposition in the \nFifth Circuit is 9.3 months.  See R. Doc. 1811-3 at p. 13. \n12 The related cases present many issues of first impression, which increases the likelihood of appeal. \n13 Such piec emeal appeals are disfavored.   See Mohawk Indus.,  Inc. v. C arpenter, 558 U .S. 100, 106 \n(2009) (\"Permitting piecemeal, prejudgment appeals . . . under mines 'efficient judicial administration' \nand encroaches upon  the prerogatives of distri ct court judges,  who play a 'special role'  in managing \nongoing litigation.) (quoting Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Ris jord, 449 U.S.  368, 374 (1981));  Clark-\nDietz, 702 F.2d at 69 (\"The basic rule of appellate jurisdiction restricts review to final judgments, avoiding \nthe delay and extra effort of piecemeal appeals.\"). \n4 \n \n\n  Having declined to certify the protective order for interlocutory appeal, the Court \nnow considers the alternative r elief requested by Moving Defendantsโa stay pending  \nresolution of an as-of-yet-filed p etition for mandamus relief in the Fifth Circuit.  There \nis no automatic stay of district  proceedings while a petition for writ of mandamus is \npending.14  Accordingl y, any such stay is i mposed under the dis trict court's general \ndiscretionary authority.15 \n  A district court has inherent authority  to manage its docket, which includes the \npower to stay proceedings.16  The moving par ty bears a \"heavy burden\" to demonstrate \nthat a stay is appropriate.17  \"Where a discretionary stay is proposed, something close to \ngenuine necessity should be the mother of its invocation.\"18   \n  For largely the reasons set forth above, Signal has failed to mak e the necessary \nshowing.  The hardship and in convenience that would result fro m a stay substantially \noutweighs any benefit,19 especially in light of the fact that mandamus relief is unlikely to \nbe granted.20  Accordingly, the Court will not issue a stay. \nCONCLUSION \n  Signal seeks to appeal an interlo cutory ruling, the resolution of which will not  \nmaterially advance the related cases to fina l judgment.  Accordingly, the Court will not \ncertify the ruling for interlocutory appeal.  Th e Court also finds that Signal has failed to \ndemonstrate that extraordinary circumstances warrant a discretionary stay.   \n \n                                                             \n14 Woodson v. Surgitek, Inc., 57 F.3d 1406, 1416 (5th Cir. 1995). \n15 See id. \n16 Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936). \n17 Costal (Bermuda) Ltd. v. E.W. Saybolt & Co., 761 F.2d 195, 203 n.6 (5th Cir. 1985) \n18 Id. \n19 See Landis, 299 U.S. at 254 (instruc ting lower courts to \"weigh competing interests and maintain an \neven balance\" in deciding whether to issue a stay). \n20 See In re LeBlanc, 559 F. App'x 389, 392โ93 (5th Cir. 2014) (noting that writ of mandamus is rarely \nissued with respect to discovery orders).  \n5 \n \n\n  New Orleans, Louisiana, this 14th day of October, 2014. \n \n _________________ _______________ \n SUSIE  MORGAN \n  UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n6 \n ",
