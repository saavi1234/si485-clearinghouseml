The case was filed after District Judge Jay Zainey <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-LA-0010-0016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">denied class certification</a> on Jan. 3, 2012 in the related case <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14377\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>David v. Signal International</em></a>. Plaintiffs were represented by private law firms.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs were brought to the United States to provide labor and services to defendant Signal International, a Mississippi company in the business of providing repairs to offshore oil rigs, including rigs in the Gulf Coast region. The complaint alleged that plaintiffs paid Signal's recruiters as much as $25,000 each for travel, visa, and recruitment fees, but upon arrival in the United States found out they would not receive the green cards promised to them. Instead, plaintiffs were allegedly forced to pay additional fees ($1050 per month) to live in racially segregated labor camps, and were subject to squalid living conditions and threats of both legal and physical harm if they complained about the conditions or decided not to provide labor.</p>\r\n<p>In Oct. 2013, the Court (Chief U.S. District Judge Louis Guirola, Jr.) consolidated this case and <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14381\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Chakkiyattil v. Signal International</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14383\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Krishnakutty v. Signal International</em></a>, and <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14385\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Devassy v. Signal International</em></a>, and then transferred the consolidated case to the Eastern District of Louisiana. <em>Achari</em> was the lead case.</p>\r\n<p>The second amended complaint of Mar. 3, 2014, filed on behalf of 47 guestworkers, alleged violations of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (18 U.S.C. &sect;1589 (forced labor) and 18 U.S.C. &sect;1590 (trafficking)) and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. &sect;1981), as well as claims for fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract. With consolidation, additional defendants were added, including attorneys, labor brokers, and recruiters involved in the trafficking scheme.</p>\r\n<p>In Apr. 2014, the Court also consolidated <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14386\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Singh v. Signal International</em></a> into <em>Achari</em>.</p>\r\n<p>On July 12, 2014, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation denied Signal's motion to transfer all of the cases pending against it to the Eastern District of Louisiana.</p>\r\n<p>On Aug. 13-14, 2014, the Court (District Judge Susie Morgan) denied defendants' motions for partial dismissal, finding that plaintiffs had sufficiently pleaded factual allegations to support their claims.</p>\r\n<p>On Oct. 14, 2014, Judge Morgan ordered Signal to refine its subpoena for bank records of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs argued that the request was not reasonably tailored so as to result in the discovery of admissible evidence, but the court disagreed since the plaintiffs were alleging financial coercion. However, the court found that since the litigation was in a late stage, Signal should be required to narrow its request from all affected persons to the named plaintiffs in the consolidated cases.</p>\r\n<p>Also on Oct. 14, 2014, Judge Morgan denied Signal's motion for interlocutory appeal of the Court's prohibition of discovery on plaintiffs' post-Signal information including immigration status, or alternatively to stay pending application for mandamus relief. Judge Morgan found that the criteria for interlocutory appeal were not present and that a discretionary stay pending the outcome of a petition for mandamus relief was not warranted. 37 F. Supp. 3d 836.</p>\r\n<p>The parties then filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On Jan. 6, 2015, Judge Morgan denied Signal's motion for partial summary judgment on plaintiffs' claim for relief under TVPA. 2015 WL 75276.</p>\r\n<p>On June 4, 2015, Judge Morgan issued an opinion determining the choice of law governing plaintiffs' common law claims. She found that the law of India governed plaintiffs' claims of fraud and negligent misrepresentation, and the law of Mississippi governed their claims of breach of contract and agency.</p>\r\n<p>A one-month jury trial was scheduled for July 2015, but the parties began settlement talks instead. By this time, the only remaining defendants were Signal, Burnett (immigration lawyer), and Dewan (recruiters). The other co-defendants were in bankruptcy proceedings, which stayed judgment against them.</p>\r\n<p>During the end of 2015, the parties entered into settlement negotiations, and on Oct. 2, 2015, the Achari (plaintiff), Chakkiyattil (plaintiff), and Burnett (defendant) parties filed a joint motion for dismissal contingent on their reaching a final agreement. In Dec. 2015, the Achari (plaintiff) and Dewan (defendant) parties filed another joint motion for conditional dismissal, and the court vacated the scheduled pre-trial and trial dates for all of the parties.</p>\r\n<p>Also in Dec. 2015, in the <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14378\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">related EEOC case</a>, the EEOC announced that the parties had reached a <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/12-18-15.cfm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">settlement</a> for all cases, approved by the bankruptcy court. Signal would pay $5 million to 476 guestworkers through a claims process. All aggrieved individuals included in the litigation could receive relief in spite of the bankruptcy proceedings. Signal's CEO also issued an apology for its conduct.</p>\r\n<p>On Apr. 7, 2017 in the <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14377\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>David</em></a> case, the parties settled the matter of attorneys' fees. The same day in <em>Achari</em>, Judge Morgan dismissed the Dewan (recruiters) and Burnett (lawyer) defendants without prejudice, though the plaintiffs could, by Aug. 1, 2018, reopen the action if the settlement was not consummated. On Apr. 18, 2017 in both <em>David</em> and <em>Achari</em> Judge Morgan entered a sealed stipulated judgment as to the Dewan defendants, though this document is not publicly available.</p>\r\n<p>The Court closed <em>Achari</em> on May 26, 2017, without prejudice. The Court shall retain jurisdiction. Any party may reopen the case if any of the unlocated plaintiffs are located so that they may be paid pursuant to the settlement agreement.</p>",

DEFENDANTS\nORDER CONSOLIDATING CASES\nAND TRANSFERRING TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT \nCOURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA\nBEFORE THE COURT are the Motion [33] to Consolidate filed by Signal\nInternational, Inc. and Signal International, LLC (โSignalโ) in cause no. 1:13cv222-\nLG-JMR, and the Motions to Transfer filed by Signal in each of the above-captioned\ncases (the โMississippi casesโ).  The motions are opposed by the plaintiffs.  After due\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 44   Filed 10/18/13   Page 2 of 10\nconsideration, the Court concludes that consolidation for the purpose of considering\ntransfer is appropriate, and that the Mississippi cases should be transferred to the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, where a\nsubstantially similar case was first filed and is pending.  Accordingly, the motions\nto consolidate and transfer will be granted.  The Court declines to rule on any\nremaining motions, leaving them for determination by the transferee court.  \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\nSignal seeks consolidation, stay and transfer of four cases to the Eastern\nDistrict of Louisiana.  The four are this case (โAchariโ), Chakkiyattl v. Signal, No.\n13cv318-LG-JMR (โChakkiyattlโ), Krishnakutty v. Signal, No. 13cv319-LG-JMR\n(โKrishnakuttyโ), and Devassy v. Signal, 1:13cv327-HSO-RHW (โDevassyโ).1  Signal\nargues that these cases are closely related to a similar lawsuit filed in the Eastern\nDistrict of Louisiana in March 2008, David, et al. v. Signal, et al., No. 2:08-CV-\n1220-JCZ-DEK (\"David\").  Signal submits that under the \"first filed\" rule, the four\ncases should be transferred so that their issues can be resolved with David.\nThe Eastern District of Louisiana district judge summarized the David\nplaintiffsโ claims as alleging a scheme to lure foreign workers to work for Signal in\nMississippi and Texas with the promise of permanent residence in the United\nStates.  Once in the United States, the David plaintiffs alleged they were subjected\nto discrimination and adverse working and living conditions.  The plaintiffs allege\n1  Devassy was recently consolidated with Achari. \n-2-\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 44   Filed 10/18/13   Page 3 of 10\nthat the recruitment defendants obtained millions of dollars in fees and Signal\nobtained workers for a lesser cost than if it hired American workers.  David, Order\n& Reasons at 4, Jan. 4, 2012 (denying motion to certify class).\nSignal is one of twelve defendants in David.2  The plaintiffs in David are a\nnumber of Indian nationals who were Signal employees.  Their Third Amended\nComplaint asserts violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\nOrganizations Act (RICO), the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act\n(TVPA), 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1985, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA),\nand claims of fraud/negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract.  Several\nplaintiffs also bring individual claims of retaliation under ยง 1981 and ยง 1985, and\nclaims of false imprisonment, assault, battery, and infliction of emotional distress.  \nThe plaintiffs in these Mississippi cases were previously among the plaintiffs\nin the David case who sought to be certified as a class.  After class certification was\ndenied by the Louisiana district court judge, they filed complaints in this Court. \n2  The David Defendants are: Signal International L.L.C; Malvern C.\nBurnett; Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, L.L.C.; Law Offices of Malvern C.\nBurnett, A.P.C.; Indo-Ameri Soft L.L.C.; Kurella Rao; J & M Associates, Inc. of\nMississippi; Billy R. Wilks; J & M Marine & Industrial, L.L.C.; Global Resources,\nInc.; Michael Pol; Sachin Dewan; and Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd. (a/k/a MedTech\nConsultants).  Signal has also filed claims against a third-party defendant, Zito\nCompanies, LLC.\n-3-\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 44   Filed 10/18/13   Page 4 of 10\nThe plaintiffs in Achari are a number of Indian nationals who allege that\nSignal, through recruiters, lured them to the United States to work in deplorable,\ndiscriminatory  conditions with the promise of permanent U.S. residency.  (Am.\nCompl. 3-7, ECF No. 26).  They assert claims of violation of the TVPA, 42 U.S.C. ยง\n1981, fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of\ncontract. \nThe plaintiffs in Chakkiyattil are a number of Indian nationals who allege\nthat Signal, through recruiters, lured them to the United States to work in\ndeplorable, discriminatory conditions with the promise of permanent U.S.\nresidency.  Chakkiyattil, No. 1:13cv318-LG-JMR, Compl. passim, ECF No. 1.  They\nassert claims of violation of the TVPA, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981, fraudulent\nmisrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract.  Id. 111-\n121.\nThe plaintiffs in Krishnakutty are a number of Indian nationals who allege\nthat Signal, through recruiters, lured them to the United States to work in\ndeplorable, discriminatory conditions with the promise of permanent U.S.\nresidency.  Krishnakutty, No. 1:13cv319-LG-JMR, Compl. 2, ECF No. 1.  They bring\nclaims against all defendants for violation of the TVPA, RICO, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981 &\n1985, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, โmoney had and\nreceived,โ breach of special/confidential relationship, and against certain\ndefendants, breach of fiduciary duty. \n-4-\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 44   Filed 10/18/13   Page 5 of 10\nThe plaintiffs in Devassy are a number of Indian nationals who allege that\nSignal, through recruiters, lured them to the United States to work in deplorable,\ndiscriminatory conditions with the promise of permanent U.S. residency.  Devassy,\nNo. 1:13cv327-HSO-RHW, Compl. 1-2, ECF No. 1.  They assert claims of violation of\nthe TVPA, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981, fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent\nmisrepresentation, and breach of contract.\nDISCUSSION\nI.  Motion to Consolidate\nSignal contends that the above cases should be consolidated only for the\npurpose of deciding whether the first-filed rule requires the Court to transfer the\ncases to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. \nSignal argues that the first-filed rule applies equally to all the cases it wishes to\nconsolidate for the purpose of transfer. \nThe plaintiffs argue that consolidation will not aid the Court as a matter of\nconvenience and judicial economy.  Plaintiffs contend that even though all four\ncases stem from David, they bring different claims against different defendants,\nand so individual attention must be given to each case in making the transfer\ndecision.  \nThe Court has broad discretion in determining whether and to what extent to\nconsolidate cases.  Ctr. for Biological Diversity, Inc. v. BP Am. Prod. Co., 704 F.3d\n413, 432 (5th Cir. 2013) (โThe trial courtโs managerial power is especially strong\nand flexible in matters of consolidation.โ); Mills v. Beech Aircraft Corp., Inc., 886\n-5-\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 44   Filed 10/18/13   Page 6 of 10\nF.2d 758, 762 (5th Cir. 1989).  The question of whether these cases should be\ntransferred to the Eastern District of Louisiana pursuant to the first-filed rule will\nrequire analysis of a single body of law in relation to each case.  The summary\nabove of each case shows that there is substantial similarity in the underlying facts\nand theories of recovery.  The Court finds that considering the cases together will\nresult in judicial economy.  Accordingly, the Motion to Consolidate will be granted.\nII.  Motion to Stay and Transfer Pursuant to the First-to-File Rule\nThe \"first to file\" rule permits a district court to decline jurisdiction over an\naction when it involves the same parties and issues as a previously-filed action in\nanother court.  When related cases are pending before two federal courts, the court\nin which the case was last filed may dismiss or transfer the case if it involves\nsubstantially similar issues which can be resolved in the earlier-filed action. See W.\nGulf Mar. Ass'n v. ILA Deep Sea Local 24, 751 F.2d 721, 728-29 (5th Cir. 1985) and\nSave Power Ltd. v. Syntek Fin. Corp., 121 F.3d 947, 950 (5th Cir. 1997).  โThe\nconcern manifestly is to avoid the waste of duplication, to avoid rulings which may\ntrench upon the authority of sister courts, and to avoid piecemeal resolution of\nissues that call for a uniform result.โ  W. Gulf Mar. Ass'n, 751 F.2d at 728. \nThe Court's inquiry is focused on whether the cases \"substantially overlap,\"\nbut where the overlap is \"less than complete, the judgment is made case by case,\nbased on such factors as the extent of overlap, the likelihood of conflict, the\ncomparative advantage and the interest of each forum in resolving the dispute.โ\nSave Power Ltd., 121 F.3d at 951.  The first-to-file rule is a discretionary doctrine. \n-6-\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 44   Filed 10/18/13   Page 7 of 10\nCadle Co. v. Whataburger of Alice, Inc., 174 F.3d 599, 603 (5th Cir. 1999) (citing\nKerotest Mfg. Co. v. C-O-Two Fire Equip. Co., 342 U.S. 180, 183-84 (1952)).  It is not\na rigid or inflexible rule to be mechanically applied.  Mann Mfg., Inc. v. Hortex, Inc.,\n439 F.2d 403, 407 (5th Cir. 1971).  The decision of whether to apply the first-to-file\nrule involves determinations concerning \"[w]ise judicial administration, giving\nregard to conservation of judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of\nlitigation.\"  Kerotest, 342 U.S. at 183.  \nIn support of its motion, Signal argues that the first to file rule applies\nbecause the issues and parties in the David case completely encompass the issues\nand parties in the Mississippi cases.  Signal provides a press release by the\nSouthern Poverty Law Center as evidence that the lawyers for the plaintiffs\nacknowledged the substantial overlap of David and the Mississippi cases.  (Def.\nMemo. Ex. 1, ECF No. 12-1).  In response, the plaintiffs argue that 1) there is a\nserious question of whether the Louisiana court can exercise personal jurisdiction\nover all of the named defendants; 2) there is no overlap of parties because the\nplaintiffs in the Mississippi cases are not parties to the David case; and 3) denial of\nclass certification in David shows that there is no substantial overlap of issues.  \nIn regard to the question of substantial overlap of parties and issues, the\nCourt finds that both exist here.  The fact that the plaintiffs are no longer parties to\nthe David case does not negate the presence of many defendants in common.3  The \n3  Defendants common to David and Achari are Signal International L.L.C;\n-7-\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 44   Filed 10/18/13   Page 8 of 10\nMississippi defendants are merely subsets of the David defendants.  \nMalvern C.

Burnett, A.P.C.; Indo-Ameri Soft L.L.C.; Kurella Rao; Global Resources,\nInc.; Michael Pol; Sachin Dewan; and Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd. (a/k/a MedTech\nConsultants).  All of the Devassy defendants are named in David.\n-8-\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 44   Filed 10/18/13   Page 9 of 10\nFurther, the issues are almost identical.  In all cases, the plaintiffs allege a\nhuman trafficking scheme that induced them to emigrate from India with the\nunfulfilled promise of permanent United States residency, and the imposition of\nadverse working and living conditions.  The theories of recovery in all of the\nMississippi cases are also presented in the David case.  Finally, it should be noted\nthat failing to meet the commonality requirements for class certification is not\nequivalent to a lack of substantial overlap of issues.  There is such substantial\noverlap that the Mississippi cases should be transferred to the Eastern District of\nLouisiana for consideration of the issues.\nThe plaintiffs question the ability of the Louisiana court to assert personal\njurisdiction over all of the defendants.  If there is such a question in these cases, it\nmust also be addressed in David, as all of the defendants named in the Mississippi\ncases are also named in David.  It would be improper for this Court to analyze the\nLouisiana courtโs jurisdiction in any event.  The Fifth Circuit has rejected the\nproposition that the first-to-file rule requires the second-filed court to consider the\njurisdiction of the first.  Cadle Co. v.

This is a human trafficking case brought by foreign workers trafficked into the \nState of Mississippi.  It is grounded in laws passed by the United States Congress to combat this \nvery problem.  Rather than hiring new workers from the Gulf Coast in the wake of a devastating \nhurricane, the Defendants instead turned the Plaintiffs into an exploitable source of cheap labor.  \nThe Defendants then worked together to defraud each of the Plaintiffs out of tens of thousands of \ndollars, falsely promised them assistance in applying for and obtaining permanent residence in \nthe United States, trafficked them into the United States, forced them to live in squalid and \nunsanitary conditions that damaged Plaintiffsโ health and psychological well-being, \ndiscriminated against them on the basis of their race, ethnicity, religion, and alienage, and \nthreatened them with financial ruin and adverse immigration action if they balked. \n2.

Burnett, the Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, Gulf Coast Immigration Law \nCenter, LLC, Sachin Dewan, Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd., Michael Pol, and Global Resources \nInc. (referred to hereafter as the โAgentsโ). \n3.  Signal is a Gulf Coast-based marine and fabrication company.  In the aftermath of \nHurricane Katrina, Signal set out to recruit several hundred foreign workers to work as \ntemporary welders and pipefitters in Signalโs Pascagoula, Mississippi facility.  Signal also \nrecruited workers to work at a Signal facility in Orange, Texas. \n4.  To assist in that process, Signal retained Michael Pol and his company Global \nResources, Inc. (โGlobalโ), a labor recruitment firm with operations in Mississippi; Malvern C. \nBurnett, an attorney based in Mississippi and Louisiana; and Sachin Dewan, a labor recruiter in \nIndia, to recruit workers on Signalโs behalf.  Signal also executed a power of attorney \nauthorizing Dewanโs company, Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd., to recruit for Signal abroad.   \n5.  The cornerstone of the Defendantsโ scheme was the tantalizing prospect that \nSignal would be able to hire a skilled workforce at effectively no cost by forcing the Plaintiffs \nand their coworkers to foot the bill for their own recruitment, immigration processing, and travel.  \nIndeed, an April 18, 2006 โSkilled Worker Recruitment Agreementโ between Signal and Global \nthat set this scheme in motion expressly stated that the workers would be delivered at no cost to \nSignal and that all other charges, expenses and fees would be paid by the workers themselves or \nby Global, who in turn would be reimbursed through deductions from the Plaintiffsโ wages.  In \nshort, Defendants paid nothing; the future employees paid everything.   \n 2 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 6 of 158\n6.  Beginning in mid-2006, Signal, both via its own employees and via its external \nAgents, traveled to India in order to recruit workers, including each of the Plaintiffs.  In printed \nadvertisements and in-person meetings in India, Defendants promised Plaintiffs that in exchange \nfor โrecruitment feesโ payable to the Agents ranging anywhere from the equivalent of $10,000 to \n$25,000, Defendants would provide Plaintiffs with jobs at Signal and assist them in applying for \nand receiving green cards.   \n7.  Defendants told Plaintiffs that because the permanent residency process could \ntake up to two years to complete and Signalโs need for workers was immediate, Defendants \nwould first assist Plaintiffs in obtaining temporary work visas, known as H-2B visas, while \nsimultaneously applying for green cards. \n8.  Lured by the promise of, in the words of one of the Defendantsโ advertisements, \nthe opportunity for โpermanent lifetime settlement in the U.S.A. for self and family,โ Plaintiffs \ntook on immense burdens to gather enormous fees, often by selling family assets and incurring \nsignificant debt at usurious rates.  Plaintiffs did this because they believed they would recoup the \nexpense with the high wages they were promised at Signal, and through the long-term \nemployment opportunities that would be available to them and their families as permanent \nresidents of the United States. \n9.  In actuality, the Defendantsโ promises regarding green cards for Plaintiffs were \nillusory.  Defendants had not taken, and had no intention at that time of taking, any steps to assist \nthe Plaintiffs in applying for or receiving green cards.  To the contrary, Signal (with the \nknowledge and assistance of the Agents) represented to the United States government that it \nwould employ the workers only temporarily, and that the workers would be returned to India \n 3 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 7 of 158\nโwithin the. . .year.โ  At no point did Signal or any of the Agents take any steps to assist any \nPlaintiff in applying for or receiving a green card. \n10.  Plaintiffs, of course, were never told of Signalโs representations to the United \nStates government.  The Plaintiffs were unaware that Defendantsโ promises of employment and \npermanent residency were false and relied on these false promises to their detriment.   \n11.  Put simply, Plaintiffs had been deceived into taking on life-altering debt for \nsomething that was never going to happen. \n12.  Upon arrival at Signalโs facilities in Mississippi, Plaintiffsโ plight only worsened.  \nSignal utilized psychological abuse, coercion, and fraud to leave Plaintiffs afraid and unable to \nleave Signalโs facilities and employ.  Plaintiffs were required to live in camps on Signalโs \nPascagoula premises, enduring barbaric and prison-like conditions.  Plaintiffs were among \nseveral hundred men crammed into trailer-like bunkhouses that were far too small for the number \nof men housed therein, and otherwise unfit for human habitation.  Privacy was non-existent.  \nToilet and bathing facilities were insufficient.  Food was often rotten.  Private โsecurity guardsโ \npatrolled the grounds like prison guards, prevented the Plaintiffs from leaving, and subjected the \nPlaintiffs to random searches of their persons and belongings. \n13.  Signal sought to deflect as much of the housing costs as possible onto the \nPlaintiffs.  For the โprivilegeโ of living in prison-like squalor, Signal deducted $35 per day from \nPlaintiffsโ paychecks, seven days a week, which constituted over 34% of the workersโ pre-tax \nearnings.  When workers requested permission to live off-site, they were told by Signal that they \ncould do so, but that Signal would continue to collect the $35 per day.  This compulsory \ndeduction essentially prohibited Plaintiffs from living in more humane conditions, lest their work \n 4 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 8 of 158\nbecome even less remunerative, and consequently their โrecruiting feeโ debt become even more \ncrushing. \n14.  Non-Indian workers were not subjected to such squalid living conditions, \ndegrading treatment, or extortionate room and board policies. \n15.  Plaintiffs were also made to work in unsafe working conditions that non-Indian \nworkers were not subjected to, and were forced to endure regular anti-Indian invective from \nSignal personnel, along with threats that they would be arrested and deported if they did not do \nSignalโs every bidding.  Indeed, Signal housed Plaintiffs in the so-called โman campsโ so that \nthey would not mix with the Pascagoula community.  The Signal executive supervising the \nPascagoula man camp referred to the facilityโprivately and in professional correspondence to \nother Signal employeesโas โthe Reservation,โ a term adopted from Signalโs โshipyard folks.โ  \nAnother Signal employee was more direct, promising Signal management on April 5, 2007 that \nif he were placed in charge of the man camp, he would not give in to the โmisguided notion that \nsome of these Indians can be reasoned withโ but would instead โmost defiantly [sic] go on a โrat \nhunt.โโ \n16.  Signal even forced men of Sikh heritage to shave their beards upon arriving in the \ncamp.  Wearing of a beard is an extremely important religious tradition to Sikh men, and \nSignalโs coercion left the men, including Plaintiff Ranjit Singh, reduced to tears. \n17.  Conditions were so poor at Signalโs Pascagoula facility that, after just a couple of \nmonths, workers (including Plaintiffs) began to consider ways to convince Signal to improve \nconditions.  In retaliation for the workersโ attempts to improve their lot, Signal terminated the \nemployment of four of the most outspoken workers, forcibly removed them from the camp and \ntold them they would be immediately returned them to India.  One of those expelled men, so \n 5 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 9 of 158\ndistraught over the thought of returning to India with the crushing debt of the โrecruitment fees,โ \nattempted suicide in front of one of the Plaintiffs. \n18.  Signal used this horrifying incident to its advantage.  In a meeting with the \nworkers (including the Plaintiffs) days after the attempted suicide, Signal told Plaintiffs that if \nany of the Signal workers filed a lawsuit against Signal, Signal would send all of the workers \nback to India.  The Plaintiffs understood this to mean that they must remain quiescent and work, \nlest Signal retaliate and ruin them financially. \n19.  Signal employed other methods of forcing the Plaintiffs to endure the abusive \nconditions.  In keeping with its focus on deflecting labor costs, upon Plaintiffsโ arrival, Signal \nrequired workers to set up โdirect depositโ bank accounts with a local bank, to which Signal also \nhad access.  These accounts gave Signal control over the workersโ ability to leave the facility \nbecause Signal could threaten to cut off the workersโ access to the accounts at any point.  Indeed, \nthis is exactly what happenedโin April, 2007, after certain workers fled the Pascagoula camp, \nthose workers were denied access to their accounts, at the behest of Signal.  This had the \nintended effect of intimidating and coercing the remaining workers, including Plaintiffs, into \ncompliance. \n20.  Deeply indebted, fearful, isolated, disoriented, and unfamiliar with their rights \nunder United States law, Plaintiffs felt compelled to continue working for Signal, on Signalโs \nonerous terms and in abusive conditions. \n21.  In line with Signalโs original intention as expressed to the United States \ngovernmentโbut not to the Plaintiffsโto employ the workers temporarily, the vast majority of \nPlaintiffs were terminated within a year and a half of arriving in Pascagoula or left to escape the \nhorrid conditions.   \n 6 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 10 of 158\n22.  At no point did Signal or the Agents ever apply for, or assist Plaintiffs in applying \nfor, permanent residency.  Moreover, consistent with its never-failing effort to improve its \nbottom line by transferring as many costs associated with their employment as possible back \nonto Plaintiffs, Signal never refunded the tens of thousands of dollars in โrecruitment feesโ \nPlaintiffs had paid in exchange for less than one year of low-paid work.  None of the Plaintiffs \nearned enough money at Signal to make the exorbitant and debt-inducing โrecruitment feesโ \neven remotely worthwhile.  Moreover, Signal never compensated Plaintiffs in any way for the \nphysical, emotional, and psychological degradations inflicted upon them at the Pascagoula camp. \n23.  In short, and as will be alleged more fully below, Defendantsโ promises of \nemployment-based green cards were fictional: \nโข\n  Defendants never filed or otherwise supported green card applications for \nPlaintiffs, or took any other steps toward assisting Plaintiffs with securing \ngreen cards; \n \nโข\n  Defendants told United States Department of Homeland Security under \npenalty of perjury that Signalโs need for workers was temporary; \n \nโข\n  Signal has stated in court filings that it never intended to provide the \nworkers with green cards, but rather with temporary H-2B visas; \n \nโข\n  Defendants segregated and confined Plaintiffs and other Indian workers to \nthe man camp because Defendants did not want Indian workers mixing \nwith other members of the Pascagoula community; and \n \nโข\n  Internal correspondence among Signal management in May 2006 shows \nthat โ[a]ll [Signal is] doing now is bringing the workers in under the H2B \nprogram.โ  \n \nDefendantsโ Conduct Violated Congressโs Clear Prohibition Against Human Trafficking \n24.  In 2000, Congress enacted the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act \nto provide enhanced legal protections for victims of human trafficking and to supplement \n 7 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 11 of 158\nexisting forms of relief.  Congress specifically included protections for persons forced to work \nout of fear of serious harm, physical restraint, abuse of the legal process, or threats of the same.   \n25.  According to House Report 106-939, the new statute was โintended to address the \nincreasingly subtle methods of traffickers who place their victims in modern-day slavery, such as \nwhere traffickers threaten harm to third persons, restrain their victims without physical violence \nor injury, or threaten dire consequences by means other than overt violence.โ  In particular, \nCongress clarified that the statute covered โa broad array of harms, including both physical and \nnonphysical,โ and could apply where the perpetrator โintentionally caus[ed] the victim to believe \nthat her family [would] face harms such as banishment, starvation, or bankruptcy in their home \ncountry.โ  \n26.  In 2003, Congress amended the statute to permit individual victims of trafficking \nto bring civil claims against their traffickers.  Plaintiffs do so here.  Plaintiffs also bring claims \nfor violations of fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of \ncontract against all Defendants and for violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 against Signal.1 \n                                                 \n1   Plaintiffs Lakshmanan Ponnayan Achari, Kodakeril Baby Biji, Xavier Disoliyan, Rajankunju \nGeevarghese, Jomon George, Shaiju Vadakkal George, Mouleswararao Guntamukkala, Joy \nJacob, Biju John, Shibu Joseph, Raveendranathan Mookaparambil Itty, Sunilkumar Marottikkal \nKuttan, Parshottam Ramchandra Mangani, Prakash Moses Kanagiah Manonmoni, Adharsan \nManuel, Jacob Mazhukkattu Mathew, Johny Mathew, Nandhakumar Nagaraj, Shaji \nVeluthalakuzhiyil Nanoo, Mangalan Chandrasekharan Pillai, Radhakrishna Pillai Sivarama Pillai, \nAby Molathu Poulose, Justin Poulose, Appunni Arul Prakash, Sreenivasarao Raparthy, Balwinder \nSingh, Ranjit Singh, Shanmugam Subramanian, Ninan John Tharakan, George Pulikkeparambil \nVarghese, Benny Kattukariyil Varkey, Shahi Vijayan, and John Yohannan (collectively, the \nโOriginal Plaintiffsโ) maintain their claims against Defendant Michael Pol, who filed a petition \nfor Chapter 7 bankruptcy on June 13, 2013, after the Original Plaintiffs filed their Complaint.   \n  Plaintiffs Varghese Varkey Abraham, Subhashithan Bahuleyan, Praveen Kulathum Muriyil \nGopalakrishnan, Eldose Isac, Thansilas Joseph, Kulath Somanathan Kalayam, Bhaskaran \nSreedharan Kutty, Nibu Raju, Savinder Singh, Kittayi Sunil Kumar Therattil, Moni \nPanikulangara Thomas, Thenooran Kumaran Unnikrishnan, Benny Chittilappilly Vareed, and the \nEstate of Kuliyanickal Paily Varghese (collectively, the โAmended Plaintiffsโ) do not bring \nclaims against Michael Pol, although they maintain their claims against Global Resources, Inc.  \n 8 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 12 of 158\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n27.

In 2004, Dewan \nConsultants contracted with Global and Burnettโthrough the Gulf Coast Immigration Law \nCenter, LLCโto identify and recruit Indian workers for employment in the United States on \npermanent residency visas.   \n82.  Defendant Sachin Dewan (โDewanโ) is the Director of Dewan Consultants.  \nDewan resides in India and has, since at least 2005, had substantial business contacts with \nPascagoula, Mississippi, including travel to Pascagoula on behalf of Signal and Dewan \nConsultants.  Dewan and Dewan Consultants will be referred to collectively below as โDewan,โ \nunless a distinction is drawn between them. \n83.  Defendant Malvern C. Burnett (โBurnettโ) is an attorney who is registered to vote \nin Mississippi and maintains offices in Ocean Springs, Mississippi.  Burnett used his Ocean \nSprings office to perform much of the legal work necessary to bring Plaintiffs and other Indian \nworkers to the United States on H-2B visas.   \n84.  Defendant Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C. (โBurnett Law Officesโ) is \na professional law corporation organized under the laws of Louisiana that maintains offices in \nOcean Springs, Mississippi.   \n 15 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 19 of 158\n85.  Defendant Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, LLC (โGulf Coast Immigrationโ) \nis a limited liability corporation organized under the laws of Louisiana that maintains offices \nMississippi.  Burnett is the registered agent of Gulf Coast Immigration.  On information and \nbelief, Burnett is the sole member and/or corporate officer of Gulf Coast Immigration.  Burnett, \nthe Burnett Law Offices and Gulf Coast Immigration operated as a joint venture and/or alter \negos, and will be referred to collectively below as โBurnett,โ unless a distinction is drawn \nbetween them. \n86.  At all relevant times, the Agents acted as the agents and/or representatives of \nSignal, and were acting within the course and scope of their agency, with the full knowledge, \nconsent, permission, authorization and ratification, either express or implied, of Signal in \nperforming the acts alleged in this complaint. \n87.  At all relevant times, the Agents were involved in a venture with each other to \nrecruit the Indian workers, including the Plaintiffs, and bring them to the United States to work at \nSignal, as memorialized by various oral and written communications and agreements, and were \nacting within the course and scope of that venture and those agreements, with the full \nknowledge, consent, permission, authorization and ratification, either express or implied, of each \nof the other Agents in performing the acts alleged in this complaint. \nSUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS \nIn the Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Signal Contracts with Dewan, Burnett, and Pol to \nBring Temporary Workers to the United States at No Cost to Signal \n88.  The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina presented both an opportunity and a \nchallenge for Signal.  The rebuilding effort offered significant potential for new work fixing \ndamaged oil rigs, ships, and other marine platforms.  At the same time, however, because the \n 16 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 20 of 158\nhurricane also destroyed or damaged thousands of homes along the Gulf Coast, including in \nPascagoula, some of Signalโs workforce had temporarily left the area.   \n89.  In early 2006, Michael Pol approached Signal with a purported solution to its \nproblem.  At a meeting in January or February of 2006, Pol told Signalโs Chief Financial Officer \nChris Cunningham, Senior Vice President and General Manager Ronald Schnoor, and Vice \nPresident of Productions for Mississippi Operations Bill Bingle, that he could deliver first-class \nfitters and welders from India at no cost to Signal.  Pol informed Signal that he would work with \nlocal immigration attorney Burnett and India-based recruiter Dewan to bring skilled welders \nfrom India.  The workers themselves would pay for all costs and fees associated with the \nrecruitment process, immigration processing, and travel to the United States, and Signal would \nnot reimburse the workers for these fees.  Signal would pay the workers between $14 and $18 \nper hour, depending upon skill level. \n90.  On April 18, 2006, Signal executed a document entitled โSkilled Worker \nRecruitment Agreementโ (the โRecruitment Agreementโ) with Polโs company, Global, \nauthorizing Global to recruit foreign skilled workers for employment at Signal โunder the โH-2Bโ \ntemporary program and/or the โpermanent residenceโ process.โ  Pursuant to the Recruitment \nAgreement, Global would be responsible for all costs associated with recruitment, transportation, \nand entry of the foreign workers into the United States and would deliver the workers โat no cost \nto Signalโ to the airport of Signalโs choice.  The cost incurred by Pol would be deducted directly \nfrom the foreign workersโ wages and paid to Pol/Global.   \n91.  On June 19, 2006, Signal executed a power of attorney with Dewanโs company, \nDewan Consultants, appointing Dewan Consultants as Signalโs โrepresentative in India to \nfacilitate the recruitment of skilled workers to the United States of Americaโ for employment at \n 17 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 21 of 158\nSignal.  The power of attorney authorized Dewan Consultants to advertise, conduct seminars and \ntrade tests, and sign any necessary legal documentation on Signalโs behalf. \n92.  Also in mid-2006, Signal entered into an attorney-client relationship with Burnett \nto advise Signal on immigration issues pertaining to Signalโs need for workers.  Signal and \nBurnett later memorialized their engagement in a written retainer agreement.  Pursuant to that \nagreement, Signal would not be responsible for any of Burnettโs legal fees.  Rather, under the \nterms of the agreement, Burnett took funds from the โrecruitment feesโ charged to the workers to \npay for the legal services he provided to Signal.   \nDefendants File Petitions for Temporary H-2B Visas, Not Green Cards \n93.  Signal requested that the Agents secure foreign workers and transport them to the \nUnited States as quickly as possible.  Signal and the Agents decided that Signal would sponsor \nworkers on an H-2B visa, which could later be extended if Signal needed more foreign labor. \n94.  In 2006, Dewan and Burnett placed newspaper advertisements in at least six \nIndian cities to recruit workers for Signal.  Some of the advertisements offered welders and \nfitters opportunities to go to the United States and obtain H-2B visas or โEmployment Based \nGreen Cards.โ  Other advertisements touted the opportunity for โpermanent lifetime settlement in \nU.S.A. for self and family.โ  \n95.  In the spring, summer, and fall of 2006, Dewan, Pol, and Burnett traveled \nmultiple times to India and the United Arab Emirates (โUAEโ) to conduct recruitment seminars \nwith interested potential workers.  Several Signal employees, including Signal Special Projects \nManager John Sanders and Vice-President of Productions for Mississippi Operations William \nBingle, traveled to India and attended these sessions.  Sanders also oversaw the immigration \ninterviews and served as contact between Signal and consular officials. \n 18 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 22 of 158\n96.  At these various seminars, the Agents promised recruits, including Plaintiffs, that \nSignal would sponsor green card applications for them.  In their seminar presentations, the \nAgents promised that although all hopeful green card applicants would automatically be enrolled \nas H-2B candidates, this would not affect the employment-based green card process. \n97.  Written agreements between Plaintiffs and the Agents also explicitly promised \nassistance in applying for and securing green cardsโassistance that Defendants took no steps \ntoward providing.  Dewan Consultants had some Plaintiffs sign โmemoranda of understanding,โ \nwhich, among other things, informed the workers that โSignal International, LLC has orally \npromised the Facilitator [Dewan Consultants] . . . that . . . [Signal] will be willing to file and \nprocess their employment base [sic.] Green Card.โ  Dewan Consultants also issued form letters \nto some Plaintiffs, informing them that Signal โshall proceed with your Green Card for United \nStates of America.โ  Likewise, the Burnett Law Offices and Gulf Coast Immigration signed \nreceipts memorializing the payment of โPart Fees for Employment Based Permanent Residence \nVisa Processing for Signal International,โ and Global issued a โServices Agreementโ promising \nsome Plaintiffs that Global would do โeverything within its power to assist worker to obtain \npermanent residence status in the United States within 24 months.โ \n98.  Signal and its Agents told the Plaintiffs that Signal would sponsor them \nimmediately for green cards in order to induce them to pay large fees to travel to the United \nStatesโwhich had the net effect of defraying nearly all the costs Signal would have had to \nexpend to recruit workers legitimatelyโand to induce them to pay exorbitant โrecruitment feesโ \nfar in excess of what would actually be required by the Defendants to obtain H-2B visas or even \nthe promised green cards. \n 19 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 23 of 158\n99.  Unbeknownst to the Plaintiffs, however, Defendants did not take any steps to \napply for permanent residence for the Plaintiffs.  Defendants only helped Plaintiffs obtain \ntemporary H-2B visas that legally prevented Plaintiffs from working for any United States \nemployer besides Signal.  Indeed, Signal made clear in its application to the United States \nDepartment of Homeland Security that its need for workers was temporary and short-lived.     \n100.  To ensure that their deception remained hidden, Defendants instructed Plaintiffs \nnot to tell United States Department of Homeland Security officials during their forthcoming H-\n2B visa interviews that, in addition to applying for temporary worker status, Signal had promised \nthem that it would sponsor them for green cards.  As Pol explained to Sanders in an August 24, \n2006 email: \nMal[vern Burnett], Sachin [Dewan] or I[ ] needs to be with each \nand every candidate going into the consulates before their \ninterview [because] [t]hey sometimes say the dumbest things and \nneed to be coached on the proper way to interview.  . . . [T]here are \nsome things that should not be known to the consulate personnel, \nsuch as the fact that we are going to process them for a green card.  \nIf one of those guys says he is going to the U.S. for immigration \nand Signal is sponsoring him for permanent residence (green card) \n. . . he is a goner. \nPlaintiffs Incur Substantial Debt to Afford High โRecruitment Feesโ \n101.  Lured by the Agentsโ promises of high-paying employment and permanent \nresidency in the United States, Plaintiffs relinquished stable employment opportunities in India \nand as guest workers in the Persian Gulf. \n102.  Apart from foregoing additional financial gains, Plaintiffs also sold personal and \nfamilial assets and incurred substantial debt to afford the fees demanded by Defendants for their \nrecruitment and travel to the United States. \n103.  These fees, quoted in various amounts to Plaintiffs, ranged from the equivalent of \napproximately $10,000 to $25,000.   \n 20 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 24 of 158\n104.  The Agents knew that these fees would cause the workers, including Plaintiffs, to \nincur substantial and potentially ruinous debt. \n105.  Each Plaintiff paid the amounts Defendants requested, as detailed in further \nallegations below. \n106.  Before receiving their visas, Plaintiffs were interviewed by officials at the U.S. \nconsulate in India.  Prior to these interviews, Dewan and other employees of Dewan Consultants \nmet with Plaintiffs, took their passports, collected payments for the consular interviews, and, at \nthe direction of Burnett, instructed them to tell consular officials that they only paid a total of \napproximately $670 in recruiting and immigration processing fees.   \n107.  Dewan told Plaintiffs that if they told the truth about the significant fees they had \npaid, their visas would be cancelled and the Agents would keep the money they had already \ncollected.   \n108.  Even in the face of significant delays in processing immigration paperwork, \nwhich left the Plaintiffs jobless and uncertain of their futures, Dewan, Pol, and Burnett refused to \nrefund any fees for any reason.  When certain Plaintiffs, including Shaiju Vadakkal George and \nAby Molathu Poulose, expressed reluctance to continue with the immigration process or pay the \nnext fee installment, Dewan, Pol, and Burnett threatened forfeiture of all money paid to that \npoint.  Defendants also loaded new, unexplained fees onto the workers, from minor fees (such as \n$45 โtesting feesโ) to significant additional last-minute travel expenses. \n109.  In the hours before their flights to the United States departed, Plaintiffs were \nrequired to wait in line to proceed through Dewan Consultantsโ cramped offices to make a final \ninstallment payment in cash.  Dewan then forced Plaintiffs to sign various documentsโmany \nwritten in English, which certain of the Plaintiffs could not read or understandโin a rushed \n 21 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 25 of 158\nfashion.  Dewan warned Plaintiffs that they would miss their flights if they did not sign quickly.  \nHe even refused to tell Plaintiffs what it was they were signing.  Only after Plaintiffs signed the \ndocuments did Dewan return their passports to them. \n110.  Thereafter, each Plaintiff boarded a flight to the United States, where they were \npicked up from the airport by Signal personnel and taken to Signalโs Pascagoula, Mississippi \nfacility. \nPlaintiffs Arrive in Signalโs Pascagoula, Mississippi Man Camp and are Subjected to \nDegrading and Discriminatory Conditions \n111.  Signal assigned each Plaintiff to work at its Pascagoula, Mississippi fabrication \nfacility.   \n112.  Signal required that each Plaintiff live in a man camp constructed in the fall of \n2006 specifically to house Indian workers.  Signal employees and management referred to the \nPascagoula man camp as โthe Reservation.โ   \n113.  Signal personnel discussed among themselves, including in written email \ncommunications, that housing the workers in a secluded man camp on the outskirts of town was \npreferable, as it would keep the Indians segregated from the rest of the Pascagoula, Mississippi \ncommunity. \n114.  The Pascagoula man camp was isolated, over-crowded, unsanitary, and not \nsuitable for human habitation.  Workers were not permitted to photograph the man camp. \nOvercrowded Bunkhouses \n115.  The camp bunkhouses themselves were not fit for long-term human habitation.  \nSignal crammed up to twenty-four men into each bunkhouse.  The bunk beds were so tightly \npacked that it was difficult for the Plaintiffs to move between them.  The top bunks were so close \n 22 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 26 of 158\nto the ceiling and the bottom bunks so close to the top bunks that Plaintiffs could barely sit up in \ntheir beds.   \n116.  The bunkhouses had insufficient toilet and showering facilities.  Lines for the \nbathroom were consistently very long.  The showers themselves were dangerous.  Electrical \nconduit joints near the showers were unglued, exposing workers to potential electrocution. \n117.  Privacy was impossible, and sleep was difficult, due to the noise from such close \nquarters, oppressive smells, and the comings and goings of workers who worked on different \nshifts.  Some workers reported rats in their sleeping areas.  Occasionally, rats ran across their \nbodies. \n118.  These conditions fell far short of basic requirements of habitability.  For example, \nthe federal governmentโs Occupational Safety and Health Administration (โOSHAโ) guidelines \nstate that bunkhouses of similar purpose should have a minimum of 50 square feet of floor space \nper habitant.  Signalโs bunkhouses offered less than 18 square feet of floor space per worker.  \nLikewise, OSHA guidelines require bunk beds to be at least 48 inches apart from other beds.  \nSignalโs bunk beds were so tightly packed together that workers were essentially sleeping next to \neach other. \n119.  Workers told Signal personnel on numerous occasions that they found these \nconditions to be intolerable.  Internal communications among Signal personnel discussed the \nโovercrowding,โ acknowledging that the Pascagoula camp was at least โ3 bunk-housesโ shy of \nappropriate capacity, and that โmore toilet/sink capacityโ was needed. \nRotten Food \n120.  The food provided by Signal was deplorable.  Meals were offered exclusively in a \nmess hall, which was only open during limited hours.  Workers who showed up a few minutes \n 23 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 27 of 158\nlate for a meal were denied food altogether.  Those who did eat were often served rotten food \nand, at times, workers found bugs in their meals.   \n121.  Plaintiffs frequently complained to Signal personnel that the food was so bad that \nthey were left hungry.  Many became physically ill or suffered chronic gastric problems, \nconditions that they made known to Signal.  \n122.   In an email to other Signal personnel, Signal Senior Vice-President & General \nManager Ron Schnoor acknowledged the โbad, stale, molded, and otherwise poor quality food.โ   \nRampant Disease \n123.  Even apart from the kitchen conditions, the man camp itself was a breeding \nground for bacteria and disease.   \n124.  Workers frequently became severely ill.  As explained by the Signalโs manager of \nthe Pascagoula man camp: \nOur Indians have been dropping with sickness like flies. . . .   \n[They] are getting w orried a nd believe there are unhealthful \nconditions in the cam p.  It is true.   The reaso n is because the \nplumbing was so shoddily done by GEโs subcontractors, and water \nhas leaked everywhere and stagnated as a result, which serves as a \nbacterial breeding ground. \nPerpetual and Abusive Oversight \n125.  Signal instilled in Plaintiffs a climate of fear through perpetual and invasive \noversight and surveillance.   \n126.  The Pascagoula man camp was located in an isolated industrial area that was \nmiles removed from other residential communities, shopping facilities, worship houses, and \nother basic amenities.  The man camp was enclosed by fences and accessible only by a single \nentrance, which was guarded by an armed security guard at all times.  When returning โhomeโ \nfrom work and entering the camp, Plaintiffs were required to show identification and subject \n 24 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 28 of 158\nthemselves and their belongings to search.  Their movements into and out of the camp were \nlogged. \n127.  Guests were not normally permitted in the man camp.  Plaintiffs were permitted \nvisitors in the parking lot. \n128.  Because the camp was isolated, Plaintiffs relied upon transportation from Signal \nto and from work and also to other populated areas.  However, Signal would only take them to \nWal-Mart or the bank.  Even then, Plaintiffs had little privacy as Signal security would \noccasionally follow them into Wal-Mart.   \n129.  Signalโs private security forces entered the Plaintiffsโ bunk areas at night.  Signal \npersonnel and camp security guards conducted โsurprise searchesโ of the bunkhouses, including \nsearches of workersโ personal belongings.   \n130.  Plaintiffs were not told when these searches would be conducted (again, in what \nwas supposed to be Plaintiffsโ โhomeโ), nor were they apprised of what it was Signal was \nlooking for.   \n131.  Signal prohibited Plaintiffs from drinking alcohol at the camp.  Violations \nsubjected the workers to fines of $250 and suspension from work.  A second โoffenseโ would \nresult in a $500 fine; a third โoffense,โ $750.   \n132.  The prohibition of alcohol was modeled after Signalโs policies for conduct in the \nworkplace despite the fact that the workers were living, not working, in the man camp.   \n133.  Signal did not bar its non-Indian workers from having visitors or drinking alcohol \nin their homes.  Nor did Signal confine its non-Indian workers to crowded bunkhouses or subject \nthem to invasive searches of their homes or belongings and near-constant surveillance.   \n 25 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 29 of 158\nSignal Charged Plaintiffs Approximately $1,050 Each Month to Live in These Conditions \n134.  For the โprivilegeโ of living in these conditions, the Indian workers (including \neach Plaintiff) were charged $35 dollars per day (approximately $1,050 per month).  From this \namount, $21 was allocated towards rent and $14 towards food.  The $35 daily fee was deducted \nautomatically from the Plaintiffsโ paychecks. \n135.  Pol personally received $1.50 per day per worker from the $14 food cost in pure \nprofit for having referred a caterer, Laxmi Catering, to Signal.  When Pol was later terminated by \nSignal, the $1.50 per worker per day profit was not remitted to the workers but was instead paid \nto another caterer, Anjay Keswani. \n136.  Before the $35 per day value was set, Signalโs Senior Vice President and General \nManager Ronald Schnoor initially recommended that Signal charge the workers $53.50 per day.  \nSchnoor reached that figure by calculating the amount it would take to amortize over just ten \nmonths the entire cost Signal incurred building the man camps in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and \nOrange, Texasโa $7 million capital expenditure.  Schnoor shockingly dismissed the devastating \nimpact of this exorbitant $1,600 per month fee by cavalierly asserting that the Plaintiffs and their \nfellow workers would all be โhappy campersโ because Signalโs living arrangements and wages \nwere likely to be an improvement over conditions in India.   \n137.  After a short time in the camp, workers (including certain Plaintiffs) began \ncomplaining about the poor conditions and asked to live outside the camp in accommodations of \ntheir own choosing.  In response, Signal informed Plaintiffs that if they tried to live outside the \ncamps, Signal would continue to deduct $35 per day from their paychecks.  Given their \nsubstantial debts, this wage deduction left Plaintiffs with no choice but to remain at the camp. \n 26 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 30 of 158\n138.  Signal did not require any non-Indian workers to pay for Signalโs capital \nexpenditures, nor did it require any other workers to pay for living expenses, whether or not they \nwere living in Signal-provided housing. \n139.  Signal imposed this onerous policy in order to avoid paying any of its own \nexpenses.  By exploiting the Plaintiffsโ tenuous financial position, heavy debt load, precarious \nimmigration situation and fear of job loss, Signal knew that they and their coworkers would have \nno choice but to continue working at the company.  Indeed, because of the grip in which Signal \nheld its Indian workers, the Plaintiffs felt compelled to remain at the Pascagoula man camp. \n140.  In contrast, workers of non-Indian race, ethnicity, or alienage were not required, \nor even allowed, to live in and/or pay for housing in the Pascagoula man camp. \nPlaintiffs Experienced Other Discrimination by Signal and its Employees \nDue to their Race, Ethnicity, Religion, and Alienage \n141.  Defendantsโ racial animus and discrimination against Plaintiffs and the other \nIndian workers took other, equally abusive, forms.   \n142.  Signal employees ridiculed Plaintiffs and accused Indians of being dirty people \nwho did not bathe.  Whether on โthe Reservationโ or at the worksite, Signal employees, \nincluding supervisors, repeatedly referred to Plaintiffs and the other Indian workers as โanimals,โ \nโIndian pigs,โ or similarly offensive and racist slurs.  Signal supervisors laughed when Plaintiffsโ \nnon-Indian co-workers harassed them. \n143.  Management frequently referred to Plaintiffs by badge number, even though they \ncalled non-Indian workers by their given names.  Some Plaintiffs were also referred to by \noffensive nicknames.  For example, Plaintiff Thenooran Unnikrishnan was referred to by Signal \nmanagers as โRaccoon,โ because they said his name was too hard to pronounce. \n 27 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 31 of 158\n144.  In an April 5, 2007 email to Signal employees Bill Bingle and Tracey Binion, \nSignal employee Darrell Snyder stated his opinion that it was a โmisguided notion that some of \nthese Indians can be reasoned with,โ and discussed his plan to engage in a โrat huntโ in the \nPascagoula camp to determine who was causing โdissensionโ among the workers. \n145.  Signal also displayed a shocking lack of respect for Plaintiffsโ religious beliefs.   \n146.  Signal knew that many of the workers were highly religious.  In particular, Signal \nknew that certain of its workers were Sikh.   \n147.  Wearing a beard is an article of faith in Sikhism.  In the Sikh tradition, a beard \ndemonstrates a love of God and respect for the natural form God bestows on man.   \n148.  Signal nevertheless demanded that Sikh workers shave their beards after arriving \nat the Pascagoula camp and threatened to deport them if they would not do so.  When Plaintiff \nRanjit Singh and other Sikhs were forced to shave their beards, they sat on the floor and cried, \ndistraught.  Workers of non-Indian race, ethnicity, or alienage and not of the Sikh religion were \nnot subject to similar treatment.  Signal also did not take any steps to provide reasonable \naccommodations to company policies or practices for its Sikh employees. \n149.  In addition, Signal knew that many of the workers were Hindu, but it treated \nPlaintiffs who practiced Hinduism differently than its Christian workers.  Hindu Plaintiffs found \nit very difficult to pray in their living quarters due to the lack of space, but Signal did not provide \nany alternative areas for them to pray.  Moreover, while Signal provided transportation to a local \nChristian church, Signal refused certain Plaintiffsโ request that it provide transportation to a \nHindu temple.  Signal employee John Sanders even required certain Hindu workers, including \nPlaintiff Thenooran Unnikrishnan, to attend a Christian church. \n 28 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 32 of 158\n150.  Signal also required Plaintiffs to engage in repeated โskills testingโ evaluations \nthat non-Indian workers were not required to take and subjected Plaintiffs to on-the-job \ndiscipline, periods without work, lower pay, and unfavorable job assignments to which workers \nof non-Indian race, ethnicity, or alienage were not subjected.  For example, when Indian workers \nfinished their assignments early, Signal required them to do extra janitorial work.  Non-Indian \nworkers were allowed to remain idle.  In addition, Signal managers controlled and closely \nmonitored Plaintiffsโ bathroom breaks, while non-Indian workers were free to use the bathroom \nwhenever they pleased.   \n151.  Signal also forced Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, to perform tasks that were \nmore difficult and more dangerous than the jobs Signal assigned to non-Indian workers.  For \ninstance, Signal made the Indian workers work in poorly lit oil rig tanks that contained powerful \nchemical fumes and lacked proper ventilation.  Signal also required Plaintiffs to work on \nshoddily-built scaffolding.  Non-Indian workers were not required to work in the oil rig tanks or \nunder similar dangerous conditions.   \n152.  Many Plaintiffs suffered injuries as a result of these and other unsafe conditions.  \nNonetheless, Signal refused them access to proper medical care.  Signal knew that the conditions \nat the Signal man camp and work site rendered Plaintiffs reliant on Signal for transportation to \ncare providers.   But when Plaintiffs were injured, Signal refused to transport them.  For \nexample, in or about January 2007, Plaintiff Johny Mathew fell from a scaffold when the \nplatform broke.  He suffered chest pains, but Signal refused to take him to a doctor.  It was only \none or two days later, after Mathewโs symptoms persisted, that a Signal security officer took him \nto the hospital.  At the hospital, the security officer told Mathew not to speak to the doctors and \ninformed them that Mathew had fallen in the bathroom.  Similarly, Plaintiff Thenooran \n 29 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 33 of 158\nUnnikrishnan suffered a head injury when he was struck with a pipe.  Instead of treating his \ninjuries, and despite the fact that his head was still bleeding, the Signal medic tested \nUnnikrishnan for the presence of drugs and alcohol in his bloodstream and then sent him back to \nwork.  When non-Indian workers suffered similar injuries, they were given proper medical \ntreatment, were not forced to take tests for substance abuse, and were given time to recover. \n153.  When Plaintiffs complained about the unsafe and illegal working conditions, \nSignal forced them to do additional cleanup work, demoted them, suspended them without pay, \nand/or threatened to deport them.  Plaintiff Parshottam Mangani was demoted after complaining \nabout slippery floors at his worksite, while other Indian workers who complained about unsafe \nconditions were suspended for three days for โsafety violations.โ  Workers of non-Indian race, \nethnicity, or alienage were not treated this way. \n154.  Defendantsโ discriminatory treatment of Plaintiffs and other Indian workers was \nmotivated by racial, ethnic, and religious animus, as well as an animus against those of Indian \nnational origin. \nSignal and the Agents Continued to Mislead the Plaintiffs \nAbout the Terms of their Employment \n155.  On numerous occasions during October, November, and December 2006, Burnett \nand Signal personnel met with workers who asked about the prospect of receiving green cards.  \nDuring these meetings, Signal personnel were told by workers that the Agents and Signal \npersonnel in India had promised that Signal would apply for and help the workers obtain green \ncards, and that the workers had paid as much as $25,000 for that opportunity. \n156.  Rather than tell the workers honestly that Signal had not applied for permanent \nresidency on their behalf and had no present intention to do so, Signal continued to deceive the \nworkers into believing that Signal would apply for and help them obtain permanent residency \n 30 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 34 of 158\nstatus.  Notably, in or about January 2007, Dewan and Burnett traveled to the man camp and, \nwith Signal employee John Sanders present, told Plaintiffs and other Indian workers that Signal \nwould provide each Indian worker, including Plaintiffs, with a green card.   Later, in and about \nthe first half of 2007, Signal posted notices in the man camp directing the workers to fill out \ncertain legal forms and submit them, along with their passports, to Signal for green card \nprocessing. \n157.  Beginning before the January 2007 meeting and continuing throughout 2007, \nSignal employees communicated and consulted with each other and with the Agents concerning \nwhat to tell workers, including Plaintiffs, about the status of their visas and green card \napplications.  Throughout that period, Signal and the Agents continued to assure Plaintiffs that \nthey would receive green cards, both in private conversations and in meetings.   \n158.  Signal also did nothing to address the fact that the Plaintiffsโ temporary \nemployment at Signal (which Signal itself represented to the U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity, under penalty of perjury, would be completed โwithin the . . .yearโ) was not \neconomically justifiable in light of the crushing amounts of debt Plaintiffs incurred and the \nmandatory $35 per day deduction for room and board.   \n159.  By at least October 2006, shortly after the first workers (including Plaintiffs) \narrived in Pascagoula, Signal personnel learned that each worker had been required to pay well \nover the equivalent of $10,000 to Pol, Burnett, and Dewan. \n160.  In internal correspondence and conversation, Signal personnel (including Signal \nexecutives) concluded that these โrecruitment feesโ were excessive and a root cause of \ndissatisfaction and low morale among the Indian workers. \n161.  Nevertheless, Signal did effectively nothing to remedy the situation.   \n 31 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 35 of 158\n162.  First, although Signal sent a letter to Dewan and Burnett requesting that they \nrefund half of the fees that they had received, Signal did not terminate its relationship with \nDewan or Burnett or impose any penalty or withhold any payment when those individuals \nrefused to comply.  In fact, Signal did nothing even after Burnett (i) asserted to Signal that \nDewan had refunded the workersโ money, and (ii) furnished affidavits signed by workers \nattesting to the โfactโ that they never paid any fees, both claims that Signal itself considered \nplainly false.   \n163.  Second, despite believing that the fees being charged were unreasonable and were \ngenerating problems, Signal never demanded that Dewan or Burnett cease collecting such fees \nfrom new recruits who were still in India.  Indeed, Signal continued to hire workers, including \ncertain Plaintiffs, through Dewan and Burnett after it learned of the unreasonable fees that they \ncharged, effectively ratifying the conduct of its Agents.  \n164.  Third, Signal did not itself refund the unreasonable fees charged by the Agents, \nnor did Signal offer any assistance to mitigate the cost or modify its contract with the Agents in \nwhich it had been agreed that neither Signal nor Global would shoulder any of the โrecruitment \nfeesโ for its Indian workers. \nIn an Attempt to Quell Rising Worker Dissatisfaction, Signal Sends Three Workers \nBack to India, One of Whom Attempts Suicide \n165.  By the spring of 2007 (approximately 3 to 4 months after workers first arrived), it \nbecame increasingly clear that the conditions at the Pascagoula camp were intolerable.  Workers \nbegan to consider ways to convince Signal to improve the conditions and sought outside advice \nfrom local church goers and attorneys. \n166.  In late February 2007, when Signal learned that certain workers had contacted a \nlawyer, Signal threatened to send the most vocal workers back to India.   \n 32 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 36 of 158\n167.  To exert additional pressure over Plaintiffs, Dewan and Dewan Consultants \nintimidated the families of certain vocal workers.  In or about March of 2007, a representative of \nDewan Consultants called Plaintiff Aby Pouloseโs family in India and warned them that Poulose \nwould be sent back to India if he did not stop making trouble at Signal.  Dewan called another \nvocal workerโs family and issued a similar threat.  And around the same time, a Dewan \nConsultants employee called Plaintiff Ninan Tharakanโs family and warned them that they would \nhave trouble in India if Tharakan created any problems in the United States.  \n168.  News of these and other calls to India spread among the workers, and \nsubstantially heightened Plaintiffsโ fears that Defendants would retaliate, perhaps even with \nviolence, against them and their families if they complained about or tried to leave the \ndiscriminatory and degrading conditions. \n169.  Signal escalated its pressure on the workers while continuing to mislead them \nabout green cards.  In a meeting with Plaintiffs and other workers on March 8, 2007, Signal \nmanagement assured the workers that Signal would โtake careโ of their green cards.  However, \nSignal management also told Plaintiffs that Signal would fight back against any โorganizingโ \nefforts, and that Signal would not extend any of the workersโ H-2B visas if a single worker took \nlegal action against Signal.   \n170.  On that same day, Signal decided to terminate and forcibly send back to India five \nof the ostensible โcamp leaders,โ and to do so in a way that would make an example out of them \nand intimidate the other workers into remaining scared and compliant.   \n171.  Early in the morning of March 9, 2007โwhen the workers for both the day and \nnight shifts were present at the campโSignal locked the gate to the Pascagoula man camp, \nthereby blocking the only exit.  At approximately the same time, Signal camp coordinator Darrell \n 33 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 37 of 158\nSnyder and five security guards swept through the bunkhouses carrying pictures of the men \ntargeted for termination.  Because Mr. Snyder and the security guards could not differentiate the \nappearance of these Indian men, they accosted numerous workers to determine whether they \nwere the individuals shown in the pictures.   \n172.  By 6:00 a.m., Signal had identified four of the five workers, taken them into \nโcustody,โ and told them that they were fired and would be deported.  Distraught at what that \nmeant for him and his family, one of these workers slashed his wrists and attempted suicide in \nfront of Plaintiff Parshottam Mangani.  The fifth worker fled the camp. \n173.  By early afternoon, local media, religious advocates, and other individuals had \ngathered outside the camp gates to express their concern over the attempted suicide and the \nforced detention of the other men. \n174.  The incidents of March 9, 2007 caused great fear in each of the Plaintiffs.  Not \nonly were they afraid of the worsening tension among the workers, they were scared of what \nSignal would do to them if they raised concerns about conditions at the camp.  Plaintiffs \nbelieved, based on Signalโs conduct, that protesting their plight would lead to arrest, \nimprisonment, bodily harm, and deportation back to India. \n175.  Indeed, by its conduct over March 8 and 9, 2007, Signal intentionally created a \nclimate of fear and intimidation in order to overawe the Plaintiffs and their coworkers into \ndropping their complaints about the camp and their treatment at the hands of Signal and its \nAgents.    \nSignal, Assisted by Burnett and Dewan, Used Fraudulent and Coercive Tactics to \nKeep Plaintiffs in the Pascagoula Camp \n176.  Following the March 9, 2007 incident, Signal and its Agents used additional \nfraudulent and coercive tactics to keep the workers, including Plaintiffs, under its control. \n 34 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 38 of 158\n177.  In or about mid-March 2007, Burnett and Dewan traveled to the Pascagoula man \ncamp to again reassure workers that they would receive green cards and warn them that they \nshould not cause any trouble for Signal. \n178.  That same month, Signal Senior Vice President Ron Schnoor addressed the entire \nPascagoula man camp about what had happened on March 9.   \n179.  Schnoor used two tactics:  fraudulent promises of long-term employment, and \nthreats to send the workers back to India. \n180.  First, Schnoor assured the men that Signal would continue to employ them for the \nโlong term.โ  That assurance was demonstrably false at the time, given that Signal still had not \ndecided whether it would extend any of the workers beyond the initial ten-month visa period, and \ngiven that Signal had already begun to evaluate the Pascagoula workers and had decided to fire \nand not apply for visa extensions for certain workers. \n181.  Second, Schnoor threatened the men, telling them that if any one Indian worker \nfiled a lawsuit against Signal, Signal would refuse to extend any of the H-2B visas for any of the \nworkers, and would therefore send all of them back to India.  Signal knew full well that this \nthreat would coerce the workers, including Plaintiffs, into staying at the camp, lest they return to \nIndia in crushing debt. \n182.  Nevertheless, even given the threats and false promises, by March 2008, over \nthree-quarters of the Indian workers in the Pascagoula camp had left Signal.  Many were \nterminated; others left of their own accordโoften by running away in the middle of the nightโ\ndue to the low pay, abusive treatment, and deplorable living conditions.     \n183.  No Plaintiff received a green card through the help of Signal or the Agents.  \nIndeed, neither Signal nor the Agents ever applied for a green card for any Plaintiff. \n 35 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 39 of 158\nMalvern Burnett Purported to Act as Attorney to Plaintiffs, but In Reality Was Working Solely \non Behalf of Defendants \n184.  At all relevant times, Burnett had an attorney-client relationship with each \nPlaintiff and, indeed, each Indian worker employed by Signal, for purposes of immigration issues \nand each Plaintiffโs work for Signal. \n185.  Burnett prepared the immigration forms required for Plaintiffs to apply for H-2B \nstatus.  In completing those forms, Burnett represented to the U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity, under penalty of perjury, that the Plaintiffs would stay in the United States only \ntemporarily, returning to India โwithin the coming year.โ  At the same time Burnett was \nsubmitting those forms, he was affirmatively telling the workers, including Plaintiffs, that they \nwould be eligible for permanent residency, and that he would assist them in applying for green \ncards. \n186.  Further, Burnett learned that, after they arrived in the United States, the workers, \nincluding Plaintiffs, asked Signal personnel when they could expect to receive green cards.   \nAfter learning this, Burnett did nothing to correct his clientsโ misimpression. \n187.  To further his deception, Burnett concealed from Plaintiffs where his true \nloyalties lay.  As noted above, by mid-2006 Burnett had entered into an attorney-client \nrelationship with Signal for the broad purpose of applying for and obtaining lawful status for \nIndian workers to come to the United States.  Later, in 2007, Signal and Burnett entered into a \nwritten Retainer Agreement memorializing the arrangement as it had been operatingโnamely \nthat Burnett would โrepresent you [Signal] in the matter of H-2B Visa extensions for MS and \nTXโ on immigration matters at zero cost while the fees for his work on behalf of Signal were to \nbe taken from the Indian workers, including Plaintiffs.   \n 36 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 40 of 158\n188.  Burnett never disclosed his attorney-client relationship or payment arrangement \nwith Signal to the Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, much less received their waiver of the \nconflict of interest it caused. \n189.  Burnett also entered into an attorney-client relationship with Dewan and Pol, \nstarting no later than mid-2006.  Burnett never disclosed this attorney-client relationship with Pol \nand Dewan to the Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, much less received their approval for it. \n190.  Burnett also had a โMultilateral Business Agreementโ with Dewan and Pol, for \nthe broad purpose of recruiting Indian workers to come to the United States.  Burnett never \ndisclosed this โMultilateral Business Agreementโ to the Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, \nmuch less received their approval for it. \n191.  One incident in particular crystalizes the contempt with which Burnett viewed his \nIndian clients.  On December 16, 2006, Burnett sent an email to Dewan and Pol regarding Pravin \nKumar N. Patel, a Signal worker and client of Burnett.  Patel had stopped payment on a check to \nBurnett.  Burnett told Dewan and Pol to ensure that โthe idiotโ Patel restore the payment and \nthreatened to have Patelโs visa โmysteriouslyโ revoked if Patel did not pay. Later in the email, \nBurnett referred to all the Indian workers, who were his clients, as โthe idiotsโ and speculated \nabout whether he should threaten them with โimmediate deportationโ in order to prevent them \nfrom stopping payment on future checks. \n192.  Burnett also forwarded emails he received from his Indian worker clients to \nDewan.  Burnett forwarded these attorney-client protected communications without permission \nfrom his clients, the workers. \n193.  Such appalling behavior violates not only the Mississippi Rules of Professional \nConduct for attorneys, but basic notions of loyalty, propriety, and honesty. \n 37 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 41 of 158\nPlaintiffs Each Relied on the Defendantsโ Representations \nLakshmanan Ponnayan Achari \n194.  In or about the last week of April 2006, Achari was working as a fitter in Chennai, \nIndia.  A boy from Achariโs hometown in Southern India called Achari and said that he had seen \nnewspaper advertisements offering the opportunity to live in the United States and obtain a green \ncard.  Achari subscribed to one of those newspapers, so he looked at the advertisement and \nconfirmed that it promised the opportunity to get a green card. \n195.  Achari then spoke with a friend, who had been working with Dewan Consultants.  \nThe friend knew the personal phone number of a man named Salimon and called Salimon on \nbehalf of Achari.  Salimon said that Achari should come to an interview. \n196.  In or about May of 2006, Achari traveled with a friend to the friendโs interview \nwith Dewan Consultants.  Achari spoke directly with Salimon, who told Achari that there were \njob openings for fitters in the United States.  Achari told Salimon that he did not have a passport, \nbut Salimon assured him that this would not be a problem. \n197.  On Salimonโs recommendation, Achari took a written test for the fitter job.  \nSalimon, Dewan, Pol, and, on information and belief, Signal employees were present for the test.  \nPol reviewed the test results and informed Achari that he passed.  Dewan also reviewed the test \nresults and made notations on Achariโs testing paperwork.   \n198.  About two days later, Achari attended a group interview.  At that interview, \nSalimon explained that Achari could obtain a green card.  Salimon also told Achari that this \nprocess would cost 600,000 rupees (approximately $11,000).2   \n                                                 \n2   Unless otherwise specified, all U.S. dollar approximations are determined through the use \nof a historical exchange rate calculator, available at \nhttp://www.oanda.com/convert/fxhistory. \n 38 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 42 of 158\n199.  Achari paid this amount to Salimon, Dewan, Burnett, and Pol in three installments \nin or about and between June and December of 2006.  To raise this money, Achari sold his \nwifeโs jewelry.  He also incurred substantial debt: he obtained two loans, each at a 36 percent \ninterest rate. \n200.  In or about November of 2006, Achari met with Dewan and, on information and \nbelief, a Signal employee.  Achari told Dewan that he had recently heard from other workers that \nthey were receiving H-2B visas and that this was the first time Achari heard that he might \nreceive anything besides a green card.  Dewan assured Achari that Achari had paid for and \nwould receive a green card. \n201.  Also in or about November 2006, Achari again met with Salimon.  Salimon \nassured Achari that he would receive a green card within eight months.   \n202.  In or about late November or early December 2006, just before he left for the \nUnited States, Achari quit his job at a workshop where he had worked for 25 years.  \n203.  On or about December 4, 2006, the day he was scheduled to fly to the United \nStates, Achari traveled to Dewanโs office in India to obtain his passport.  Although Achari \narrived in the morning, Dewan did not meet with him until the eveningโjust two hours before \nhis flight was scheduled to depart.  Dewan demanded that Achari sign blank pieces of paper and \npay the final installment of his โrecruitment feesโ before Dewan would give him his passport.  \nAchari felt intimidated and that he had no choice but to comply.  He signed and left for the \nairport. \n204.  After arriving in the United States, Achari felt compelled to remain at Signalโs \nman camp because Signal would deduct living expenses from his paycheck even if he lived \nelsewhere.  Moreover, he felt that he could not leave the job at Signal because he had taken out \n 39 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 43 of 158\nlarge loans at high interest rates to pay the โrecruitment fees.โ  He knew he would not earn \nenough to pay those loans back and feed his family if he returned to India. \n205.  Defendants also continued to assure Achari that he would receive a green card.  \nFor instance, shortly after he arrived in Pascagoula, Achari attended a meeting led by Pol, \nBurnett, Dewan, and Snyder.  At the meeting, Burnett said that Signal would apply for H-2B \nextensions for the workers three times, and would then apply for their green cards.  In or about \nearly-to-mid 2007, Achari attended another meeting led by Pol, Burnett, and Snyder.  At that \nmeeting, Burnett told the workers that he had applied for their H-2B extensions and that their \ngreen cards would also be processed.  \n206.  Achari relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, Achari \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nVarghese Varkey Abraham \n207.  In or about May of 2006, Abraham was working as a welder in Dubai, when he \nsaw a newspaper advertisement placed by Dewan Consultants.  The advertisement offered the \nopportunity to obtain an H-2B visa and a green card with permanent residency in the United \nStates.  Abraham called Dewan Consultants and spoke to Salimon, who told Abraham to attend \nan interview in India. \n208.  Based on Salimonโs promises of a green card, Abraham quit his job in Dubai, \npurchased an airline ticket, and flew to India.   \n 40 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 44 of 158\n209.  On or about May 19, 2006, Abraham attended an interview with Michael Pol and \nSalimon.  Pol and Salimon told Abraham he could obtain permanent residency and a green card \nif he worked in the United States.  Pol and Salimon also asked Abraham to take a written test as \npart of his job application.  After Abraham passed the test, Pol and Salimon gave Abraham a \nletter from Signal that promised permanent residency and a green card. \n210.  At the interview, Pol and Salimon told Abraham that the immigration process \nwould cost about 600,000 rupees (approximately $13,187).  Abraham paid this amount to \nDewan, Salimon, Pol, and Burnett in installments.  To raise the money, he used his savings, sold \na small business that he had owned, and also took out a loan at a 10 percent monthly interest rate.  \n211.  On or about November 26, 2006, Abraham traveled to Dewan Consultantsโ office \nto pay Dewan the final installment of the โrecruitment fees.โ  Dewan learned that Abraham did \nnot have about 50,000 rupees (approximately $1,118) of the approximately 600,000 rupees that \nDefendants had demanded.  As a result, Dewan refused to give Abraham his passport or his \nplane ticket to the United States.  Dewan also opened Abrahamโs suitcase and confiscated all of \nAbrahamโs papers concerning permanent residency. \n212.  Over the next twenty-four hours, Abrahamโs wife arranged for the remaining \n50,000 rupees to be paid to Salimon.  Only then did Dewan give Abraham his passport and plane \nticket.  He did not return Abrahamโs documents concerning permanent residency.  Abraham then \nflew to the United States. \n213.  Upon arriving at Signal, Abraham learned for the first time that Signal would \ndeduct approximately $245 per week from his paycheck for food and housing and that he would \nbe sleeping in a trailer with 23 other men.  The food was terrible, and the work was much more \ndangerous than that to which he was accustomed.  Nonetheless, he felt compelled to stay at the \n 41 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 45 of 158\nman camp and work for Signal because he had depleted all of his assets and incurred enormous \ndebt to pay the โrecruitment feesโ that Defendants demanded.  His H-2B visa only allowed him \nto remain in the United States if he worked at Signal, and he knew that if he returned to India, he \nwould never be able to repay his loans.   \n214.  Signal officials also continued to assure Abraham that they would process his \ngreen card.  Throughout the first half of 2007, Abraham attended camp meetings approximately \nevery two months at which Signal officials stated that they would extend the workersโ visas and \nobtain their green cards. \n215.  Abraham relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, Abraham \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nKodakeril Baby Biji \n216.  In or about July 2006, Biji saw a newspaper advertisement offering the chance to \nobtain an H-2B visa and then permanent residency in the United States.  In response, he called \nDewan Consultants, and Salimon told Biji that he should attend an interview that would take \nplace about one month later.   \n217.  Salimon, Dewan, and two Signal employees were present at Bijiโs initial \ninterview.  The Signal employees gave Biji a written test, and Salimon explained that Biji and \nthe other attendees would obtain a ten month H-2B visa and then a green card.  Salimon also \n 42 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 46 of 158\nexplained that this process would cost over 600,000 rupees (approximately $12,500).  This \nmoney would be paid to Dewan Consultants, Pol, and Burnett.   \n218.  Relying on the Agentsโ promises of receiving a green card, Biji quit his job of \nnine years and paid the 600,000 rupees demanded by the Agents between approximately July and \nDecember 2006.  To raise the money, he used his savings and borrowed from a bank at an \ninterest rate of approximately 10 to 13 percent annually.  Biji borrowed other funds at a 20 \npercent annual interest rate. \n219.  Approximately one or two months after his initial interview, Biji brought a fee \ninstallment to Dewan and Burnett at a hotel in India.  Burnett told Biji that he would receive a \nvisa and gave Biji paperwork promising an H-2B visa and permanent residency.  Then, on or \nabout November 7, 2006, Biji met again with Salimon, who stated that Biji would travel to the \nUnited States for ten months on an H-2B visa, return to India, and then come back to the United \nStates with a green card. \n220.  Just before Biji left India, Dewan forced him to sign paperwork written in \nEnglish.  Because Biji did not speak or read English, he could not understand what the \npaperwork said. \n221.  After arriving in the United States, Biji learned that the living conditions at Signal \nwere terrible and that Signal staff members treated the Indian workers like animals.  After a few \nmonths, Biji and three friends rented a local apartment for approximately $740 per month.  \nNonetheless, Signal continued to deduct $35 per day from Bijiโs paycheck for room and board.  \nEven though he was earning far less than he had been led to believe he would, Biji felt that he \nhad no choice but to continue working for Signal because he had spent all of his savings and \n 43 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 47 of 158\nborrowed a great deal of money to travel to Mississippi.  He believed that the only way he could \nearn enough money to repay his loans was to if he continue to work for Signal. \n222.  Biji also continued to believe that Signal would provide him with a green card.  In \nor about December 2006, Biji met with Burnett and Sanders at the Pascagoula camp.  Biji asked \nboth Burnett and Sanders when he would receive his green card.  Both assured him that Signal \nwould file for his green card.  In or about mid-2007, Biji also attended a meeting at which a \nSignal official again promised that the company would apply for the workersโ green cards. \n223.  Biji relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good working \nconditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work for Signal \nin the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by Signal, his \nneed to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ โrecruitment \nfees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, and his fear that \nSignal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, Biji felt intimidated into \nacquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nSubhashithan Bahuleyan \n224.  In or about the spring of 2006, Bahuleyan saw a newspaper advertisement that \nDewan Consultants had listed, offering an opportunity to work for a โLeading Marine and \nFabrication Companyโ in Mississippi or Texas and obtain a โpermanent-employment visa.โ  The \nadvertisement listed interview and testing dates in July 2006.  Bahuleyan attended one of these \nmeetings, where he took and passed a written test administered by Dewan and a Signal \nemployee. \n225.  After the test, Dewan and Salimon told Bahuleyan that if he accepted the job at \nSignal, he would travel to the United States on a nine-month visa and Signal would obtain a \ngreen card for him.  Dewan and Salimon assured Bahuleyan that he would become a permanent \n 44 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 48 of 158\nresident of the United States and would be able to bring his family to live with him.  Dewan told \nBahuleyan that this process would cost 600,000 rupees (approximately $13,200).   \n226.  Bahuleyan paid these โrecruitment feesโ to Dewan, Pol, and Burnett in \ninstallments between August and November 2006.  To obtain the funds, Bahuleyan took out a \nloan with a monthly interest rate of approximately 7 percent.  Due to the exorbitant interest rate, \nBahuleyan ultimately paid over 1,800,000 rupees (approximately $39,600) to settle this debt. \n227.  In or about early November 2006, Bahuleyan met with Dewan, Salimon, and \nBurnett to discuss his upcoming interview at the U.S. consulate.   They instructed Bahuleyan to \ntell the consular officials that he was only planning to stay in the United States for nine months. \n228.  Shortly after the interview, a Dewan Consultants employee called Bahuleyan and \ntold him to bring his final installment to Dewanโs Mumbai office.  On or about November 27, \n2006, Bahuleyan traveled to Dewanโs office.  As he waited in line to meet with Dewan, he saw a \nDewan Consultants employee tell another man that he had not brought enough money.  When the \nman told Dewan that he had no more money, Dewan told him that he could not go to the United \nStates; the man began to cry. \n229.  Bahuleyan began to worry whether Dewan also would accuse him of not having \nenough money.  Indeed, when Bahuleyan gave his money to Dewan and Dewanโs brother, they \nclaimed that Bahuleyan owed an additional 33,000 rupees (approximately $700).  Bahuleyan \nprotested that he had brought the requested amount, but Dewan and his brother said that it was \nnot enough.  Dewan did not give Bahuleyan his passport until Bahuleyan called his wife and \narranged for the remainder to be paid to a friend of Salimon.  Shortly thereafter, Bahuleyan left \nfor the airport and flew to the United States. \n 45 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 49 of 158\n230.  When Bahuleyan arrived in the United States, he learned that Signal would deduct \n$705 from his paycheck for tools and $35 each day for room and board.  Bahuleyan felt like a \nprisoner at the camp.  Signal regulated every aspect of his life, including where he went, what he \nate and drank, and what he could bring into the camp.  Eventually, Signal reduced his salary to \n$12 per hour without explanation.  Bahuleyan spoke with the general foreman, who told \nBahuleyan that, if he was unhappy with this pay, he could return to India.  Bahuleyan knew that \nhe could not risk losing all of his income from Signal because the interest on his loans was \nincreasing daily.  He felt that he had no choice but to agree to this wage deduction. \n231.  In or about early 2007, Bahuleyan attended many meetings at Signal.  Each time, \nSignal employees told the workers that the company would extend their visas and apply for their \ngreen cards.  In particular, on or about March 7, 2007, Bahuleyan attended a meeting led by \nSignalโs Vice President.  A number of workers asked about the status of their green cards, and \nthe Vice President assured Bahuleyan and other workers that Signal would โtake care of \neverything.โ \n232.  On the day that Signal fired several Indian workers in March 2007, Bahuleyan \ntraveled to the hospital with the Indian worker who attempted suicide.  Bahuleyan explained to a \ndoctor that he and other Indian workers had paid up to $20,000 to travel to the United States and \nhad been promised green cards.  He explained the stress that they were all under from the \nconstant threats of deportation.  A Signal safety officer who had accompanied them to the \nhospital overhead the conversation and warned Bahuleyan not to say anything negative about the \ncompany. \n233.  A few days later, Bahuleyan attended another camp meeting at which Dewan \nwarned the workers not to make any trouble for Signal.    \n 46 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 50 of 158\n234.  Bahuleyan relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, \nBahuleyan felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nXavier Disoliyan \n235.  In or about June 2006, Disoliyan was working as a welder in Abu Dhabi and saw \nan advertisement in a local newspaper promising an opportunity to work for a โleadingโ United \nStates marine company that would provide work visas and permanent residency.  In or about July \n2006, Disoliyan attended a walk-in skills test in India, at which Dewan, Salimon, and Signal \nrepresentatives were present.  At the skills test, Dewan and Salimon told Disoliyan and other \nworkers that they would travel to the United States on H-2B visas.  Dewan and Salimon also said \nthat, after six months, the workers would receive green cards and would be able to bring their \nfamilies to the United States.   \n236.  Dewan and his agents told Disoliyan and others that they would need to pay over \n700,000 rupees (approximately $14,436) for this opportunity.  Disoliyan spoke privately with \nDewan and Salimon and told them that he did not have enough money.  Dewan and Salimon \nexplained that Disoliyan could pay in installments, and he should take advantage of the \nopportunity because the job in the United Sates would allow him to save 150,000 rupees \n(approximately $3,000) every month.  Based on Dewanโs and Salimonโs assurances, Disoliyan \nbelieved that he would be able to pay back any loans in as few as six months.   \n 47 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 51 of 158\n237.  Disoliyan paid the fees demanded by Dewan, Pol, and Burnett by using family \nproperty as collateral for loans.  He secured a loan for approximately 300,000 rupees by posting \nthe house that he had built and the property he had received as part of his wifeโs dowry as \ncollateral.  Disoliyan borrowed the remaining 400,000 rupees (approximately $8,200) through a \nloan against which his brother-in-law offered his own house as collateral.  Pursuant to the terms \nof this loan, Disoliyan was required to begin repaying the principal within one month, and a \ndefault would mean foreclosure on his brother-in-lawโs home. \n238.  In or about August 2006, Disoliyan met with Dewan, Salimon, and Burnett to pay \nfor what Burnett said was his permanent residency visa.  At this meeting, Burnett assured \nDisoliyan that his permanent residency application would be granted.   \n239.  In or about November 2006, Disoliyan traveled to Dewanโs office in Mumbai to \npay his final fee installment and receive his plane ticket and passport.  It was there that he first \nlearned that Signal would charge him $35 per day for food and accommodations.  Disoliyan was \nupset about this additional cost and concerned that it would make it more difficult for him to \nrepay his loans.  Dewan assured Disoliyan he would be able to send 150,000 rupees \n(approximately $3000) back to India each month.  Regardless, Disoliyan decided that he had no \nchoice but to agree because Dewan and his associates told him that if he refused, he would not \nreceive a refund of the fees that he had already paid.  Dewan also pressured Disoliyan to sign \nadditional paperwork without giving him an opportunity to read it because they were in a rush to \nget to the airport. \n240.  Upon arrival in the United States, Disoliyan felt that Signalโs work conditions \nwere unsafe.  He did not express those concerns to Signal management, however, because he \nobserved that Signal demoted, fired, suspended, or reduced the pay of Indian workers who \n 48 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 52 of 158\ncomplained about the conditions.  At times, Disoliyan was unable to send enough money home \nto repay his loans because of the charges Signal deducted from his paycheck.  Nonetheless, he \nwas afraid to leave Signal because he had paid so much money to get there.  He knew that he \nwould never be able to earn enough in India to repay his debts.  \n241.  Disoliyan relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, Disoliyan \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nRajankunju Geevarghese \n242.  In or about April 2006, Geevarghese saw an advertisement in an Indian \nnewspaper that offered jobs in the United States for pipefitters and welders.  The advertisement \nalso stated that workers would receive work visas and green cards.  Geevarghese called Dewan \nConsultants and was told to attend one of a series of meetings scheduled for early May. \n243.  On or about May 2 or 3, 2006, Geevarghese attended a meeting at the Trident \nHotel in Cochin, at which Dewan, Pol, and Salimon were present.  Upon information and belief, \nSignal staff members were also present.  During the meeting, Dewan said that the workers would \ninitially receive H-2B visas, which would be extended for nine additional months.  At the same \ntime that the workers were processed for H-2B visas, Signal would also apply for green cards for \nevery worker.  Dewan stated that the cost for the entire process would be 700,000 rupees \n(approximately $15,630), which would be paid in three installments to Pol, Burnett, and Dewan.  \nEither Dewan or Pol also promised that the workers would have good accommodations, with \n 49 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 53 of 158\nonly two people per room.  At Dewanโs request, Geevarghese and other interested workers \nsigned a โtemporary contract,โ which documented what was discussed at the meeting, including \nthe fees and the promise of a visa and a green card. \n244.  Approximately three days later, Geevarghese received a call from Salimon, who \ntold him to attend a welding test on or about May 8, 2006.   Geevarghese took two tests \nadministered by two Signal employees.  Salimon then informed him that he had passed and \nshould begin to collect the money needed for his fees.   \n245.  Although Dewan had initially told Geevarghese that the process would cost \n700,000 rupees, the Agents ended up demanding even more from Geevarghese, which \nGeevarghese paid.  In order to raise the money necessary to pay the fees, Geevarghese depleted \nhis savings and sold his wifeโs and his childrenโs jewelry.  In addition, he took out one loan for \n250,000 rupees (approximately $5,582) and another loan for 450,000 rupees (approximately \n$10,102), both at 24 percent annual interest rates.   \n246.  Following his skills tests, Salimon called Geevarghese regularly to provide him \nwith updates concerning the status of his case and to inform him when and where to pay the fee \ninstallments.  Geevarghese paid these fee installments to Dewan, Pol, and Burnett in or about \nMay through November 2006.   \n247.  On or about November 6, Geevarghese met with Dewan, Salimon, and Sanders, \nwho told him not to mention the fees he had paid to Dewan, Pol, and Burnett during his \ninterview at the United States Consulate.   \n248.  On or about November 24, 2006, Salimon arranged for Geevarghese to fly from \nCochin to Mumbai so that he could make his final payment and receive his passport and plane \nticket to the United States.   When Geevarghese met with Dewan that day, Dewan insisted that \n 50 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 54 of 158\nGeevarghese pay an additional 4,000 rupees (approximately $90) for the plane ticket to Mumbai.  \nGeevarghese had not been told about this fee and only had 6,000 rupees left for travel expenses.  \nDewan, however, refused to give Geevarghese his passport and ticket to the United States until \nhe paid the 4,000 rupees.  Intimidated by Dewan, afraid of being stranded in Mumbai, and fearful \nof losing the opportunity to work in the United States, Geevarghese paid Dewan.  Dewan then \ndemanded that Geevarghese sign several contracts without offering him enough time to review \nthem. \n249.  In the United States, Geevarghese was shocked by the living conditions he was \nforced to endure.  He also learned for the first time that Signal would deduct money from his \npaycheck for the tools he used.  Nonetheless, Geevarghese was afraid to leave his position at \nSignal and return to India; he had sold everything of value that his family owned and knew he \nwould never be able to pay back his enormous debts working in India.   \n250.  Moreover, Signal officials and the Agents repeatedly reassured him and the other \nworkers that Signal would process their green cards.  In particular, Geevarghese attended a \nmeeting in or about November or December 2006 at which John Sanders and a Signal Vice \nPresident stated that Signal would process the paperwork necessary to make the workers \npermanent residents.  In or about March 2007, Geevarghese attended another meeting led by \nSignal senior management, Dewan, and Burnett.  They again promised that Signal would process \nthe workersโ green cards. \n251.  Geevarghese relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \n 51 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 55 of 158\nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, \nGeevarghese felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nJomon George \n252.  In or about April or May 2006, J. George saw an advertisement in an Indian \nnewspaper for pipefitting jobs in the United States.  The advertisement stated that permanent \nresidency status would be available to workers after six to nine months.  J. George called the \nlisted number and spoke with Salimon, who told him about an interview and informational \nseminar.  Salimon and Dewan were present at the seminar, as were two or three men from \nSignal.  Salimon explained that in order to obtain their green cards, the workers would need to \npay Dewan, Pol, and Burnett 600,000 rupees (approximately $13,400).   \n253.  J. George later took and passed a qualifying test.  After the test, a Signal \nrepresentative assured J. George that he would receive permanent residency status if he accepted \nthe job with Signal.  J. George then signed an agreement with Signal, which he understood to \npromise him a 10-month H-2B visa that would be extended and then converted into a green card.   \n254.  In or about August 2006, J. George met with Burnett and Dewan, who promised \nhim that the workers would receive green cards that would enable them to live and work \npermanently in the United States. \n255.  J. George paid the 600,000 rupees demanded by Dewan, Pol, and Burnett in \ninstallments in or about August through November 2006.  In order to raise this money, J. George \ntook out a loan at 18 percent annual interest, using a piece of land that his wife owned as \ncollateral.  He also sold all of his wifeโs jewelry and borrowed money from his brother and \nseveral friends.   \n 52 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 56 of 158\n256.  Before flying to the United States, J. George traveled to Dewanโs Mumbai office \nto collect his passport and plane ticket and pay his final installment.  J. George asked Dewan if \nhe could get his money back if he did not want to go to the United States, but Dewan told him \nโno.โ  J. George felt he had no choice but to continue on to the United States.  Dewanโs agents \nrequired J. George to sign various documents, but because the documents were in English and \nthe agents rushed him, J. George did not have an opportunity to read or understand what he was \nsigning.  \n257.  In the United States, J. George and the other Indian workers were told by Sanders \nand other Signal officials that they would receive green cards, but that if they caused any trouble, \nthey would be sent back to India.   In early-to-mid 2007, J. George also saw a notice in the man \ncamp advising workers to give their legal documents to Darrell Snyder for green card processing.  \nBelieving that Signal would finally begin to process his green card, J. George followed the \ndirections.   \n258.  J. George believed that he had no choice but to endure the unsanitary and unsafe \nconditions without complaint because Signal controlled his immigration status.  He did not want \nto jeopardize his employment with Signal because he needed to earn enough money to pay off \nthe debt he had incurred in order to pay Dewan, Pol, and Burnett. \n259.  J. George relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.

George \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nShaiju Vadakkal George \n260.  In or about April 2006, S. George had been working as a welder in Oman for nine \nyears when he learned from a friend about an advertisement for welding jobs and permanent \nresidency in the United States.  After calling Dewan Consultants and speaking with Salimon, S. \nGeorge took emergency leave from his job to attend a seminar in India led by Dewan, Salimon, \nand Burnett.  At the seminar, Burnett explained that the workers would travel to the United \nStates on H-2B visas, which would be extended twice.  They would then receive green cards and \nbe able to bring their families to the United States permanently.  Dewan explained that green \ncard processing would cost 550,000 rupees (approximately $12,280), and H-2B processing \nwould cost 200,000 rupees (approximately $4,460). \n261.  Approximately one month later, S. George received a call from Salimon, who \nexplained that the fee had been reduced to 600,000 rupees (approximately $13,070).  S. George \nsaid that he wanted to wait for a green card rather than start with an H-2B visa, but Salimon \nconvinced him to start work on just an H-2B visa.  Shortly after this conversation, S. George \ncompleted a skills test administered by Salimon and several Signal employees.  After a Signal \nemployee told George that he passed the test, Salimon instructed S. George to begin collecting \nmoney for his first payment.  \n262.  S. George paid the 600,000 rupees demanded by the Agents by borrowing money \nat an interest rate of approximately 5 percent per month.  He secured a second loan using his \nwifeโs jewelry as collateral.  Just before his consular interview, S. George resigned from his job \nin Oman. \n 54 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 58 of 158\n263.  On or about November 28, 2006, S. George traveled to Dewanโs office to pay his \nfinal fee installment and receive his ticket and passport.  Dewan refused to give S. George his \nticket and passport, however, because Dewan claimed that he owed an additional 10,000 rupees.  \nS. George knew that if he failed to pay the 10,000 rupees, he would forfeit all of the money that \nhe had already paid to Dewan, Pol, and Burnett.  S. George also felt compelled to pay because he \nhad already quit his job in Oman and he could not make enough money in India to repay his \ndebts.  He begged some friends who were also at Dewanโs office to help him, and together, they \nwere able to raise 10,000 rupees.  After S. George paid his final fees, Dewan would not give him \nhis ticket and passport until he had relinquished all of the receipts and documents that he had \nreceived in connection with his recruitment. \n264.  After S. George arrived in the United States, John Sanders told him that Signal \nwould process his green card application.  In or about March 2007, S. George attended a meeting \nat which Burnett, Dewan, and Sanders warned the Indian workers not to criticize Signal if they \nwanted to obtain green cards.  Sanders stated very clearly that if the workers worked hard and \nbehaved well, Signal would process their green cards. \n265.   S. George was very upset by the living and working conditions at Signal, as well \nas the sizable deductions that Signal took from his paycheck for accommodations and tools.  \nHowever, S. George felt that he could not leave because he needed to earn enough money to \nrepay the loans he had incurred in order to get to the United States.  Moreover, after the March \n2007 incident in which Signal fired a number of workers, S. George was terrified that if he \ncaused any problems, Signal would fire him and have him deported.   \n266.  S. George relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \n 55 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 59 of 158\nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, S. George \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nPraveen Kulathum Muriyil Gopalakrishnan \n267.  In or about June of 2006, Gopalakrishnan was working as a welder in Bahrain \nwhen he learned about a newspaper advertisement offering the opportunity to work for Signal in \nthe United States and to obtain a green card.  Because of this advertisement, Gopalakrishnan quit \nhis job and traveled to India so he could apply to work at Signal. \n268.  On or about June 20, 2006, Gopalakrishnan traveled to a welding center in India \nto take a welding test for the Signal job.  Salimon, Dewan, and a Signal employee were present.  \nSalimon and Dewan spoke to the applicants.  They said that applicants who were chosen for the \njob would work for Signal and obtain a green card.  This process would cost 600,000 rupees \n(approximately $13,100).   \n269.  Gopalakrishnan completed and passed the welding test.  After the test, he was told \nto complete and sign several documents.  He did not understand the documents, but he believed \nthat they were part of the application process and would help him obtain a green card.   \n270.  Gopalakrishnan ultimately paid the โrecruitment feesโ demanded by Dewan, Pol, \nand Burnett between approximately June and November 2006.  To obtain this money, \nGopalakrishnan mortgaged his home to a private lender at an interest rate of approximately 15 to \n16 percent. \n 56 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 60 of 158\n271.  Approximately two to three weeks after he took the welding test, Gopalakrishnan \nmet with Salimon to discuss the job at Signal.  Gopalakrishnan asked Salimon whether he would \nreceive a green card, and Salimon assured him that Signal would help him obtain a green card. \n272.  On or about August 23, 2006, Gopalakrishnan met with Salimon and Burnett to \npay an installment of his โrecruitment fees.โ  At that meeting, Burnett promised Gopalakrishnan \nthat he would receive a green card through his employment at Signal. \n273.  On or about November 18, 2006, Gopalakrishnan traveled to Dewanโs office in \nMumbai to make his final payment and obtain his plane ticket to the United States.  Dewan did \nnot give Gopalakrishnan his passport until Gopalakrishnan gave Dewan his final fee installment.   \n274.  Upon Gopalakrishnanโs arrival at the man camp, Signal employees informed him \nthat he had to pay Signal $245 each week for room and board.  Gopalakrishnan asked if he could \nrent an apartment outside the man camp, but Signal employees told him that he had to remain at \nthe man camp.  Gopalakrishnan felt like a prisoner at Signal.  He was monitored constantly, and \nhis foreman repeatedly threatened to report him for poor workmanship.   Gopalakrishnan felt that \nhe could not complain about the living and working conditions because he needed the job to \nrepay his debts.  Moreover, he was afraid to leave the camp because he thought that Signal \nemployees would find him and send him back to India.  \n275.  In addition, Signal and the Agents continued to promise Gopalakrishnan that he \nwould receive a green card.  In particular, in or about February or March 2007, Gopalakrishnan \nattended a camp meeting led by Burnett and Dewan, who told Gopalakrishnan and other workers \nthat Signal was in charge of their green card processing.  \n276.  When Gopalakrishnan finally escaped from the man camp, he attempted to access \nhis bank account and discovered that Signal had frozen his account. \n 57 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 61 of 158\n277.  Gopalakrishnan relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and \ngood working conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to \nwork for Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse \nby Signal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, \nGopalakrishnan felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nMouleswararao Guntamukkala \n278.  On or about May 23, 2006, Guntamukkala read a newspaper advertisement placed \nby Dewan Consultants.  The advertisement offered the opportunity to work in the United States \nand obtain a green card.  That same day, Guntamukkala spoke with a representative of Dewan \nConsultants, who told him that he could obtain an H-2B visa, which would be converted to a \ngreen card if he worked at Signal for one year. \n279.  Approximately one week later, Guntamukkala attended a small meeting at the \noffice of Dewan Consultants, where Dewan explained the process in similar terms.  Dewan also \nstated that it would cost each worker the equivalent of approximately $20,000.  Shortly after the \nmeeting, Guntamukkala took and passed a welding test, at which Dewan, Pol, and a Signal \nemployee were present.  Dewan and Pol gave Guntamukkala a signed statement promising that \nhe would receive a green card if he passed his welding test and worked at Signal. \n280.  In order to raise the money to pay Dewan, Pol, and Burnett, Guntamukkala \nborrowed the equivalent of approximately $7,000 from a neighbor at approximately 3 percent \ninterest per month.  He also borrowed approximately $12,000 from his closest friend at 2 percent \ninterest per month and sold his homeโthe only property he ownedโto repay his friend.  \nGuntamukkala borrowed the remainder of the fees from his family.  Guntamukkala paid all of \n 58 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 62 of 158\nthe fee installments that the Agents demanded between June and November 2006.  Dewan \nConsultants withheld his passport until he paid this money. \n281.  After arriving in the United States, Guntamukkala asked a Signal employee when \nhe would obtain his green card.  The employee told Guntamukkala that the green card paperwork \nwas being processed slowly due to the large number of people who would be obtaining green \ncards.  He told Guntamukkala not to worry, however, and assured him that he would receive a \ngreen card.  In or about early-to-mid 2007, Guntamukkala also attended a camp meeting at which \nSignal employees informed the workers that Signal was processing their green cards. \n282.  Despite the dangerous and difficult work conditions at Signal, Guntamukkala was \nafraid to complain.  When he told a supervisor that Signal was pushing him to work too hard, the \nsupervisor told him that Signal would send him back to India if he complained again.  \nGuntamukkala thought about leaving Signal every day, but he felt that he had no choice but to \nstay.  He knew that he could not repay his debts if he returned to India.  Moreover, Signal had all \nof his paperwork, and he could not work for any other employer in the United States under the \nterms of his H-2B visa.   \n283.  Guntamukkala relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and \ngood working conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to \nwork for Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse \nby Signal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, \nGuntamukkala felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \n 59 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 63 of 158\nEldose Isac \n284.  In or about May of 2006, Isac saw a newspaper advertisement in a local Indian \npaper offering the opportunity to work as a welder or pipe fitter in the United States, where he \ncould obtain permanent residency.  The advertisement listed Dewan Consultantsโ contact \ninformation.  Isac called the phone number listed and spoke with Salimon.  Salimon told Isac to \nattend a skills test and interview, where Isac could learn more about this opportunity. \n285.  Instead of traveling to Dubai, where he had secured a job as a pipe fitter, Isac \nattended the test and interview.  He met with Salimon and two or three Americans, who Salimon \nintroduced as representatives of Signal.  Isac took a written test, and a Signal official informed \nhim that he had passed. \n286.  Isac then spoke with Salimon, who promised Isac that he would be able to leave \nfor the United States within six months on an H-2B visa and would receive a green card in the \nUnited States.  Salimon told Isac that this process would cost 650,000 rupees (approximately \n$13,500). He assured Isac that once he received his green card, he could bring his family to the \nUnited States as well. \n287.  Isac paid the 650,000 rupees to Burnett, Pol, and Dewan in installments between \napproximately August and November 2006.  To obtain this money, Isac used his sisterโs and \nmotherโs gold jewelry and his familyโs land as collateral to obtain loans from banks.  Isac also \nobtained additional loans from friends. \n288.  On or about August 6, 2006, Isac paid his first installment to Burnett, Salimon, \nand Dewan.  Burnett gave Isac a receipt documenting his payment for โemployment based \npermanent residence visa processing for Signal International.โ \n289.  Shortly after this meeting, Isacโs prospective employer in Dubai told Isac to travel \nto Dubai as soon as possible to beginning working.  Isac told Salimon that he was considering \n 60 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 64 of 158\nthis opportunity, but Salimon promised Isac that he would travel to the United States soon, and it \nwould not be worthwhile for Isac to travel to Dubai to work for a short time.  Isac declined the \njob opportunity in Dubai. \n290.  In or about September or October 2006, at two different meetings, Salimon and \nDewan told Isac not to tell United States consular officials that he would receive a green card.  \nThey assured him that this was part of the process, and any other answer would prevent him from \ntraveling to the United States.  Isac felt compelled to follow Dewan and Salimonโs instructions \nbecause he had already given up his job in Dubai and had incurred substantial debt.  In at least \none of these meetings, Dewan assured Isac that he would receive permanent residency after \narriving in the United States. \n291.  On or about November 23, 2006, Isac traveled to Dewanโs office in Mumbai to \nmake his final payment.  Dewanโs staff forced Isac to sign, quickly, documents written in \nEnglish.  They did not allow Isac to read the documents and told him that the documents only \ncontained formalities.  Only after Isac signed the documents and gave Dewan's staff all of the \npaperwork related to his recruitment did he receive his passport.   \n292.  After Isac had arrived at Signal, he asked John Sanders when he would receive a \ngreen card.  Sanders told Isac that his โpaperwork would move forwardโ and would be ready for \nhim.  Isac understood this to mean that he would receive a green card.   \n293.  Isac was very unhappy with the conditions at Signal.  When he arrived in the \nUnited States, he learned that Signal would deduct $35 per day from his paycheck for room and \nboard.  Despite the fact that this deduction severely reduced Isacโs wages, he felt compelled to \nendure the conditions at Signal because he needed the job to repay his debts.  \n 61 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 65 of 158\n294.  Isac felt that he could not even complain about the conditions at Signal because \nSignal might deport him.  Signalโs camp manager told Isac that his H-2B visa prevented him \nfrom working for another company and he would be deported if he looked for another job.  \nSignal employees also posted a notice in the man camp warning employees about the dangers of \nlosing their immigration status.  After the March 2007 incident during which several workers \nwere fired, Isac felt particularly afraid that he would be deported or fired if he tried to leave the \nman camp or asked for help from someone outside Signal. \n295.  In or about July 2007, Isac attended a meeting at which Signal employee Darrell \nSnyder told Isac that Signal was applying for the workersโ visa extensions and assured him that \nSignal would also apply for their green cards.  When Signal posted a list of workers for whom \nthey had submitted visa extension applications, Isacโs name was on the list.  Isac believed that \nthis meant he would also eventually receive a green card. \n296.  Isac relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good working \nconditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work for Signal \nin the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by Signal, his \nneed to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ โrecruitment \nfees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, and his fear that \nSignal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, Isac felt intimidated \ninto acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nRaveendranathan Mookaparambil Itty  \n297.  In or about late 2005, Itty saw a newspaper advertisement in Abu Dhabi offering \nthe opportunity to work in the United States.  Itty called the phone number listed on the \nadvertisement and spoke with Dewan.  Dewan told Itty to attend an upcoming meeting at a hotel \nin Abu Dhabi.   \n 62 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 66 of 158\n298.  Approximately one month later, Itty attended the meeting.  Only two other \npotential workers were present.  Dewan gave a presentation and stated that the opportunity to \nwork in the United States would cost 500,000 rupees (approximately $10,600).  Itty was hesitant \nto pursue the opportunity because he thought the cost was too high. \n299.  In or about February 2006, a friend told Itty that he had given money to Dewan \nConsultants.  Itty called Salimon, who told Itty to attend another upcoming meeting at a hotel.  \nDewan and two other people led that meeting.  Dewan explained to the audience that they were \nlooking for employees to work in the United States for Signal and obtain a visa and permanent \nresidency.  Dewan explained that the workers would receive green cards after arriving in the \nUnited States and could bring their families for an additional fee.  He again said that this process \nwould cost 500,000 rupees (approximately $10,600), which would include payments to Dewan, \nPol, and Burnet.  Dewan explained that Pol and Burnett worked with Signal. \n300.  Shortly after the meeting, Itty took a skills test administered by Signal employees.  \nHe was then interviewed by Signalโs piping superintendent.  These Signal employees told Itty \nthat he would obtain an H-2B visa within 6 months, and would receive a green card within 18 \nmonths to 2 years. \n301.  Itty paid all of the fees demanded by Dewan, Pol, and Burnett in or about July \nthrough December 2006.  He raised the money for these fees by mortgaging his home and taking \nout a loan at an interest rate of approximately 13.5 percent. \n302.  The day that Itty was scheduled to fly to the United States, he met with Dewan at \nhis office in Mumbai.  Dewan refused to give Itty his passport until Itty paid the remaining \nbalance of his fees and gave Dewan all of the documents relating to his recruitment.  Then, just \nbefore Itty left for the airport, Dewan required Itty to sign several documents.  Itty did not \n 63 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 67 of 158\nunderstand the documents, but he felt that he had no choice but to sign because he had already \npaid so much money to the Agents and knew that they would not refund these fees. \n303.  After Itty arrived at Signal, Signal deducted approximately $400 to $450 each \nweek from his paycheck for room and board.  Because this cost would be deducted even if he \nlived elsewhere, he felt compelled to remain at the man camp.  He feared that if he complained, \nhe would be fired or deported.  He was also afraid that if he left Signal, Signal would call \nimmigration officials or the police, and he would be arrested or deported.  He knew that if he \nwere sent back to India, he would not be able to repay his debts.   \n304.  Itty also felt compelled to remain at Signal because Defendants continued to \npromise him a green card.  For instance, in or about February 2007, Dewan came to Signal and \nexplained to Itty and the other workers that their visas would be extended, and that they would \neventually receive green cards.   \n305.  Itty relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good working \nconditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work for Signal \nin the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by Signal, his \nneed to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ โrecruitment \nfees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, and his fear that \nSignal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, Itty felt intimidated \ninto acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nJoy Jacob \n306.  In or about mid-2006, Jacob saw a newspaper advertisement offering jobs in the \nUnited States.  He called Dewan Consultants, and was invited to attend a meeting at which \nDewan, Salimon, Pol, and Burnett were present.  At the meeting, Dewan and Salimon showed a \nvideo about Signal and told the attendees that Signal would provide green cards for the workers \n 64 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 68 of 158\nafter they had been at Signal for approximately nine months.  At this meeting, Jacob also signed \nsome documents that were written in English.  Although he could read some English, he could \nnot understand what the documents said. \n307.  During additional meetings with Dewan, Pol, and/or  Burnett in India, the Agents \nmade numerous representations that led Jacob to believe that in exchange for paying thousands \nof dollars in โrecruitment fees,โ Signal and the Agents would assist Jacob with applying for and \nreceiving permanent residency in the United States.   \n308.  In reliance on these promises, Jacob paid approximately 600,000 rupees \n(approximately $13,187) in โrecruitment feesโ to Dewan, Pol, and Burnett, and paid an \nadditional 200,000 rupees (approximately $4,395) in travel expenses.  In order to raise this \nmoney, Jacob took out private loans, using his house and his parentsโ house as collateral. \n309.  Soon after arriving in the United States, Signal officials told Jacob that his visa \nwould be extended and that he would receive a green card.  However, Jacob was very unhappy \nwith the squalid living conditions, the inedible food, and the dangerous working conditions.  \nAfter Signal fired several workers in March 2007, Jacob became afraid to criticize Signal \nbecause he did not want to be deported.  Jacob felt compelled to remain at the man camp and \nwork for Signal because he needed to repay his debts and knew that he would not earn enough to \ndo so in India.   \n310.  Jacob relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \n 65 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 69 of 158\nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, Jacob \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nBiju John \n311.  In or about April or May of 2006, John read an advertisement in an Indian \nnewspaper for a job in the United States that would pay $144 per day and promised H-2B work \nvisas or green cards.  John called Dewan Consultants and spoke with a representative of the \ncompany.  The representative told John that Malvern Burnett would obtain a green card for him \nand that the process would cost 650,000 rupees (approximately $14,515). \n312.  John attended a seminar in or about May 2006, where he met Dewan, Salimon, \nPol, Burnett, and Sanders.  They confirmed that John would need to pay 650,000 rupees in \nโrecruitment fees.โ  They also told John that if he paid Burnett an additional $4,000, he could \nwork anywhere in the United States.   \n313.  John paid Dewan, Pol, and Burnett 650,000 rupees in three installments.  John \nalso paid an additional 400,000 rupees (approximately $8,350) in travel and other expenses \nrelated to this process, resulting in a total cost of 1,050,000 rupees (approximately $22,865). \n314.  John raised the money for these expenses and fees by selling a piece of property \nthat he owned, borrowing money from his brother, and borrowing money that his father raised by \nselling land and other items.  He also borrowed 150,000 rupees (approximately $3,130) at 5 \npercent monthly interest.   \n315.  On or about November 19, 2006, John traveled to Dewanโs Mumbai office to \ncollect his passport and plane ticket to the United States.  Shortly before John left to catch his \nflight, Dewan gave him a โservice agreementโ document and told him to sign it immediately.  \nDewan told John that he could not board the plane until he signed the agreement.  Dewan also \nsaid that if John missed his flight, he could not recover the money he had paid.  Because his \n 66 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 70 of 158\nflight was about to leave, John quickly signed the agreement without reading it.  When Dewan \ngave John his passport and plane ticket, John learned he had paid twice the value of the plane \nticket. \n316.  After arriving in the United States, John felt compelled to live at Signalโs man \ncamp because Signal would deduct living expenses from his paycheck even if he lived \nelsewhere.  John was shocked at the terrible living conditions and dangerous working conditions, \nbut he was afraid to complain because Signal threatened to send him and other workers back to \nIndia if they misbehaved or spoke to others about Signalโs actions.  John also felt that he could \nnot leave his job at Signal.  He had sold all of his property and borrowed a large amount of \nmoney to come to Signal.  He knew that he could not make enough to repay his debts and \nsupport his wife and children if he returned to India.  John was even afraid to leave the camp, \nbecause he thought he would be arrested or deported.   \n317.  In addition, Signal and its Agents continued to promise him a green card.  In or \nabout December 2006, John asked Sanders when he would receive a green card.  Sanders replied \nthat Signal would apply for an H-2B extension and would then apply for his green card.  In or \nabout late 2006 or early 2007, John also saw notices in the man camp advising workers to ensure \nthat their names were spelled correctly on their immigration documents so that Signal could \nprocess their green cards.   \n318.  John relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good working \nconditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work for Signal \nin the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by Signal, his \nneed to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ โrecruitment \nfees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, and his fear that \n 67 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 71 of 158\nSignal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, John felt intimidated into \nacquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nShibu Joseph \n319.  In or about April 2006, S. Joseph read a newspaper advertisement offering the \nopportunity for pipe fitters to work in the United States and obtain green cards.  He spoke with a \nrepresentative of Dewan Consultants, who invited S. Joseph to attend a seminar in May to learn \nmore about the opportunity.   \n320.  On or about May 2, 2006, S. Joseph attended a seminar at which Pol, Burnett, \nDewan, and Salimon were present.  Either Pol or Burnett (S. Joseph is uncertain of which) \nexplained that workers would travel to the United States on H-2B visas, which would be \nextended for 18 to 24 months while their green card applications were processed.  After they \nreceived green cards, the workers would be able to bring their families to the United States.  \nDewan explained that this process would cost a total of 600,300 rupees (approximately $11,000) \nto be paid in installments to Burnett, Pol, and Dewan.  S. Joseph called Salimon after the \nseminar, and Salimon confirmed that workers would receive H-2B visas and green cards.   \n321.  In or about May 2006, S. Joseph took a written exam administered by a Signal \nofficial.  Salimon and Dewan were also present, and Salimon again assured S. Joseph that those \nwho were hired would travel to the United States on H-2B visas while their green cards were \nbeing processed.   \n322.  To pay his โrecruitment fees,โ S. Joseph posted his wifeโs jewelry as collateral for \na loan, and borrowed additional money from his brother, a friend, and his wifeโs family.  S. \nJoseph also borrowed money from an acquaintance at approximately 3 percent interest per \nmonth.  S. Joseph paid his first and second fee installments in or about August and November \n2006, respectively. \n 68 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 72 of 158\n323.  On the day of his flight to the United States, S. Joseph traveled to Dewanโs office \nin Mumbai and paid his final fee installment.  At Dewanโs office, either Dewanโs assistant or his \nbrother took all of S. Josephโs receipts and paperwork relating to his recruitment.  S. Joseph \nfeared that if he refused to give up his paperwork, he would lose the money he had paid.  Dewan \nthen demanded that S. Joseph quickly sign a number of papers, and said that he would not give \nS. Joseph his passport if he refused.  Afraid that he would lose all of the money he had already \npaid and the opportunity to work in the United States, S. Joseph signed the papers without having \na chance to read what they said. \n324.  At Signal, S. Joseph asked permission to live outside the man camp, but Sanders \ntold him that the costs for room and board would be deducted from his wages even if he did not \nlive there.  Because he could not repay his loans if he paid room and board both to Signal and \noutside the man camp, S. Joseph felt that he had no choice but to remain at the camp.  The living \nand working conditions were deplorable, and the food often made him sick.  However, he felt \ncompelled to continue to work for Signal because it was the only way that he could repay his \ndebts and keep his family from being cast into poverty.  S. Joseph also attended meetings in or \nabout early 2007 at which Signal officials promised that they would obtain green cards for the \nworkers. \n325.  S. Joseph relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \n 69 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 73 of 158\nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, S. Joseph \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nThansilas Joseph \n326.  In or about June of 2006, T. Joseph was working as a welder for a large company \nin India when he saw a newspaper advertisement offering the opportunity to work for Signal in \nthe United States and to obtain a green card.  The advertisement stated that those interested in the \nopportunity should attend a meeting and interview session. \n327.  Four or five people participated in T. Josephโs interview, including Dewan, \nSalimon, and two Americans.  Salimon assured T. Joseph that if he worked for Signal, the \ncompany would process a green card for him within 10 to 15 months.  Salimon said that T. \nJoseph would be able to bring his family to the United States, his wife would be able to obtain a \ngood job, and that his children would be able to attend good schools.  Dewan and Salimon told \nT. Joseph that this process would cost 800,000 rupees (approximately $17,432).  T. Joseph told \nDewan and Salimon that this was too much money.  \n328.  The following day, Joseph attended a second interview.  He spoke again with \nDewan and Salimon, who agreed that T. Joseph could pay 600,000 rupees (approximately \n$13,074) instead of 800,000 rupees.  T. Joseph then took a welding test, which Dewan, Salimon, \nand the Americans supervised.  One of the Americans told T. Joseph that he had passed the test. \n329.  Between approximately June and December 2006, T. Joseph paid at least 600,000 \nrupees in installments to Pol, Burnett, Dewan, and Salimon.  To obtain the money that they \ndemanded, T. Joseph sold some jewelry belonging to his wife and children and posted the \nremaining jewelry as collateral for a loan at a 2 percent monthly interest rate.  In addition, he \nsold the land his wife had provided as dowry for their marriage.  Finally, T. Joseph borrowed \nabout 300,000 rupees (approximately $6,702) from a private lender at a 9 percent monthly \n 70 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 74 of 158\ninterest rate, using his family home as collateral.  T. Joseph sold these possessions and borrowed \nmoney at such high interest rates because Salimon and Dewan had assured him that he would be \nable to receive a green card, bring his family to the United States, and obtain a good job at \nSignal.  \n330.  In or about early November of 2006, T. Joseph traveled to a hotel before his \ninterview with the U.S. consulate.  At the hotel, T. Joseph met with Dewan, Salimon, and some \nAmerican men, including Malvern Burnett.  Beginning soon after this meeting, Salimon and \nDewan repeatedly called T. Joseph and pressured him to pay the remainder of his โrecruitment \nfees.โ \n331.  On or about December 5, 2006, T. Joseph traveled to Dewanโs office to pay his \nfinal fee installment and obtain his passport.  T. Joseph saw Dewan threaten other workers and \nwarn them that they could not take receipts detailing their payments to Defendants to the United \nStates.   \n332.  When it was T. Josephโs turn to meet with Dewan, Dewan demanded that T. \nJoseph sign papers written in English.  T. Joseph could not read English, so he asked Dewan \nwhat the paperwork said.  Dewan refused to answer and demanded that that T. Joseph sign \nquickly.  T. Joseph was intimidated and feared that if he did not pay Dewan or sign the \ndocuments, he would lose the money that he had incurred substantial debt to pay to the Agents.  \nT. Joseph therefore signed the documents and paid his final payment to Dewan.  Only then did \nDewan give T. Joseph his passport. \n333.  Upon arrival in the United States, Signal employees required T. Joseph to sign \nseveral forms written in English.  T. Joseph could not read the forms, but he felt compelled to \nsign them so that he could begin working and repaying his debt. \n 71 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 75 of 158\n334.  Approximately every two weeks between December 2006 and November of 2007, \nT. Joseph attended several camp meetings with Signal officials.  At these meetings, Signal \nofficials repeatedly assured the workers that their visas would be extended and that they would \nreceive green cards.  Dewan also spoke at a meeting in or about March of 2007.  At this meeting, \nDewan told T. Joseph and other workers that if they continued to work hard and listen to Signalโs \ninstructions, they would receive green cards. \n335.  After T. Joseph received his first paycheck, he learned that Signal was deducting \napproximately $240 per week for room and board.  When T. Joseph asked a Signal manager if he \ncould live outside the man camp, the manager warned T. Joseph that he could not work for \nSignal if he lived outside the man camp, and would likely be deported.  T. Joseph felt that he had \nno choice but to stay at the man camp.  T. Joseph also felt that his only option was to continue to \nwork for Signal for as long as he could.  He had incurred so much debt to come to the United \nStates that he felt that he would rather die than face the shame of returning to India, where he \nwould not able to repay his loans and support his family.  \n336.  T. Joseph relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, T. Joseph \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nKulath Somanathan Kalayam \n337.  In or about April 2006, Kalayam saw an advertisement in the Malayalam \nManorama newspaper offering United States H-2B visas and โemployment based green card[s].โ  \n 72 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 76 of 158\nKalayam called the number listed in the advertisement and spoke with Salimon, who invited him \nto a meeting in Cochin that would take place later that week.  At the meeting, Salimon explained \nthat workers would travel to work at Signal on H-2B visas and that Signal would provide them \nwith green cards in approximately eighteen months.  Salimon also explained that applicants \nwould have to pay 600,000 rupees (approximately $14,100) in three installments to Dewan, Pol, \nand Burnett.  Dewan, Pol, and Burnett were also present at the meeting. \n338.  Kalayam paid the 600,000 rupees to Dewan, Pol, and Burnett between \napproximately June and November 2006.   In order the raise the money to pay these fees, \nKalayam depleted his life savings, including money that he had saved to buy a house for his \nfamily. \n339.  Kalayam also met with Burnett, Dewan, and Salimon several times between \napproximately June and November 2006.  In or about August 2006, Kalayam signed agreements \nwith Dewan, Burnett, Global, and Signal.  The agreement with Dewan stated that Dewan would \nproceed with his โemployment based permanent residence visa.โ  Shortly thereafter, Kalayam \nmet with Burnett, Salimon, and Dewan.to make a fee payment.  He spoke with Dewan and \nSalimon, who assured him that they would process his green card.  He also received a receipt \nfrom Burnett memorializing his payment of $1,427.50 for โemployment based permanent \nresidence visa processing for Signal International.โ  Although Kalayam asked Salimon for a \nreceipt for the money he had paid to Dewan, Salimon said he could only give Kalayam a receipt \nif he paid additional fees. \n340.  In or about September or October 2006, Kalayam was informed that the medical \ntest he had taken was invalid and he needed to take another one.  He had to pay approximately \n2,000 additional rupees (approximately $470) for this test. \n 73 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 77 of 158\n341.  Soon thereafter, Kalayam met with Burnett, Dewan, and Salimon to discuss his \nupcoming interview at the U.S. consulate.  Salimon told Kalayam not to disclose the fees he had \npaid.   He also instructed Kalayam and to tell consular officials that he planned to return to India \nbefore the end of July 2007. \n342.  In or about November 2006, Kalayam traveled to Dewanโs Mumbai office to \nmake his final fee payment and collect his passport.  Before Dewan gave Kalayam his passport, \nhe demanded that Kalayam return all of the paperwork relating to the Signal opportunity.  \nKalayam told Dewan that he did not have his paperwork, and Dewan threatened to withhold his \npassport.  Kalayam was afraid that he would lose all of the money he had already paid to Dewan.  \nHe had seen Dewan forcibly take documents from several workers that day and refuse to give \ntravel documents to other workers who failed to pay the amount demanded by Dewan.  \nUltimately, Dewan relented, but he insisted that Kalayam sign a number of documents quickly, \nwithout reading them.  Only after Kalayam had signed the documents did Dewan give him his \npassport.   \n343.  After arriving at Signal in or about December 2006, Kalayam was horrified to \ndiscover that he had to live in a crowded trailer and that Signal would deduct $35 per day from \nhis paycheck for food and accommodations.  Nonetheless, Kalayam felt that he had no choice \nbut to remain at Signal.  He had used all of his familyโs savings to travel to the United States to \nget his green card, and he knew that all of that money would be lost if he went back to India.  \nKalayam was afraid to criticize Signal because Signal officials threatened to deport the workers \nif they caused any trouble.  He was even afraid to leave the camp because he thought that the \npolice or immigration workers would arrest him. \n 74 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 78 of 158\n344.  In addition, Signal officials and the Agents continued to promise Kalayam that he \nwould a receive green card.  In or about early 2007, Kalayam attended a meeting at which \nDewan, Burnett, and Sanders promised the workers that Signal would apply for their green cards.  \nIn or about March 2008, John Sanders called a meeting and reiterated that Signal would process \nthe workersโ green cards. \n345.  Kalayam relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, \nKalayam felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nSunilkumar Marottikkal Kuttan  \n346.  In or about May or June of 2006, Kuttan read a newspaper advertisement offering \nthe opportunity to work in the United States and obtain an H-2B visa and green card.  The \nadvertisement listed the contact information for Dewan Consultants.  A few days after seeing the \nadvertisement, Kuttan attended a large meeting, where Salimon, Dewan, Burnett, and Sanders \nwere present.   Dewan and Salimon explained that Kuttan and other Indian workers would travel \nto the United States and work at Signal for eleven months while their green cards were \nprocessed.  Afterwards, they would return to India for a very short time after which they could \ncome back to the United States with their families. \n347.  In or about May or June of 2006, Kuttan met with Sanders and another American \nto take a welding test.   \n 75 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 79 of 158\n348.  Kuttan ultimately paid Dewan, Pol, and Burnett approximately 600,000 rupees \n(approximately $13,170) in installments between June and December 2006.  To pay these fees, \nKuttan sold his wifeโs wedding jewelry, borrowed money from his family, and took out a loan at \n18 percent interest.   \n349.  In or about December of 2006, Kuttan traveled to Dewanโs office to collect his \nplane ticket and passport.  Dewan required Kuttan to sign some documents before receiving his \nticket and passport.  Because Dewan rushed him, Kuttan did not have time to read the documents \nor understand what he had signed. \n350.  After Kuttan arrived at Signal, Signal and the Agents continued to promise that he \nwould receive his green card.  In or about July 2007, he attended a meeting at which Signal \nofficials stated that they would provide the workers with visa extensions and green cards.  Kuttan \nlater made an appointment with Burnett to ask him when he would receive his green card.  \nBurnett also told Kuttan that Signal would apply for his green card. \n351.  Kuttan relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, Kuttan \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nBhaskaran Sreedharan Kutty \n352.  In or around May of 2006, Kutty saw an advertisement in an Indian newspaper \nthat offered the opportunity to work in the United States and obtain permanent residency.  The \nadvertisement instructed interested applicants to attend a meeting at a hotel in Cochin.  Kutty had \n 76 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 80 of 158\nrecently completed interviews with a Singapore company and made arrangements to begin \nworking there, but he felt that he could not ignore an opportunity to live and work in the United \nStates.   \n353.  Kutty attended the meeting in Cochin, which was led by Burnett, Dewan, and a \nDewan Consultants employee.  They told Kutty that they would provide workers with a job at \nSignal in the United States, a green card, and living accommodations.  The recruitment process \nwould cost 700,000 rupees (approximately $15,564).   Soon after this meeting, Kutty took a \nwritten and practical test.   \n354.  In or about June 2006, Kutty was informed that he had passed the tests.  He \ndecided to pursue the Signal opportunity and pass up the job in Singapore. \n355.  Kutty paid Dewan, Pol, and Burnett the 700,000 rupees in โrecruitment feesโ in \ninstallments between approximately June and December 2007.  To raise the money, Kutty \nobtained a loan at a 13 percent interest rate by using gold and property as collateral. \n356.  In or about June or July 2006, Kutty visited Dewanโs office and asked whether he \nwould receive a green card if he worked for Signal.  One of Dewanโs employees assured him that \nhe would.  On the basis of this promise, Kutty made his first fee payment. \n357.  On or about August 9, 2006, Kutty met with Dewan, Burnett, and another \nAmerican to prepare for Kuttyโs interview with the U.S. Consulate.  They instructed Kutty not to \ntell the consulate that he would receive a green card. \n358.  On or about December 17, 2006, Kutty traveled to Dewanโs Mumbai office to \nmake his final fee payment.  Only after Kutty paid Dewan in cash did Dewan give Kutty his \npassport and airline ticket.  Kutty was also required to sign several documents written in English, \n 77 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 81 of 158\nwhich he did not understand.  Because the Dewan Consultants employees had left him very little \ntime to get to the airport, Kutty quickly signed the documents so he would not miss his flight. \n359.  In the United States, Signal deducted approximately $400 from Kuttyโs paycheck \nfor tools.  Signal also deducted between $200 and $300 per week for food and housing. \n360.  Kutty felt compelled to endure the deplorable conditions at Signal.  He saw Signal \nemployees retaliate and threaten to deport Indian workers who complained.  Kutty feared that if \nhe complained, Signal would also retaliate against him or have him deported.  He knew that he \ncould not afford to be sent back to India, where he would not be able to repay the debts he had \nincurred to pay Defendantsโ โrecruitment fees.โ \n361.  Kutty relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, Kutty felt \nintimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nParshottam Ramchandra Mangani \n362.  In or about and between April and July 2006, Mangani read a newspaper \nadvertisement for a job that offered permanent residency in the United States. \n363.  In or about the summer of 2006, Mangani attended a seminar in New Delhi, \nwhere Dewan and an American gave a presentation about a job opportunity.  They explained that \nMangani and other workers would travel to the United States on H-2B visas, which would then \nbe converted into green cards.  Dewan then distributed documents which stated that the process \nwould cost 700,000 rupees (approximately $15,155).   \n 78 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 82 of 158\n364.  Mangani paid Dewan, Burnett, and Pol these โrecruitment feesโ in installments in \nor about and between July and November of 2006.  To raise the money to pay these fees, \nMangani sold a 2 acre farm that had provided much of his familyโs income.  He also sold a \nresidential property he owned with a relative.  After these sales, the only property his family \nowned was his fatherโs house, where Mangani and his mother, wife, and daughter also lived. \n365.  Just before he flew to the United States, Mangani traveled to the office of \nDewanโs agent.  An employee demanded that Mangani sign paperwork.  Mangani asked if he \ncould read the paperwork, but the employee insisted that Manganiโs flight to the United States \nwould leave soon, and there was no time to read the paperwork.  Mangani felt that he had no \nchoice but to sign.  Only then did Mangani receive his passport.  \n366.  After Mangani arrived in the United States, Signal required him to sign \npaperwork agreeing that Signal could deduct $245 per week from his paycheck for food and \nhousing.  When Mangani and other workers asked if they could live outside of the man camp, \nSignal employees said that they had to remain at the camp.  Signal also required Mangani to sign \npaperwork under which he agreed to pay for the tools that he used.  Because the Signal \nemployees threatened to send him back to India if he would not agree to this condition, Mangani \nsigned the paperwork. \n367.  Mangani had been told by Dewan, Burnett, and Pol that he would earn the \nequivalent of 200,000 to 300,000 rupees (approximately $4,300 to $6,462) per month at Signal.  \nBased on these assurances, he had expected that he would be able to repay his debts and \nrepurchase his land.  Only after signing the paperwork allowing Signal to deduct hundreds of \ndollars per week from his salary did Mangani realize how difficult it would be to realize these \ngoals. \n 79 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 83 of 158\n368.  On multiple occasions, Mangani observed Signal personnel threaten to suspend or \ndeport workers who complained about the conditions at Signal or did not work hard enough.  As \na result, Mangani felt compelled to work quietly and without complaint.  He was afraid of being \nsent back to India.  Employers there did not pay enough for him to repay his debts, and he \nneeded to support his family.  He was also afraid that Dewanโs agents might retaliate against him \nif he returned to India. \n369.  In addition, Signal and the Agents continued to promise Mangani that he would \nreceive a green card.  For example, in or about early 2007, Mangani attended a number of \nmeetings at which Signal officials, Burnett, and Dewan assured him and other workers that \nSignal would process their green cards.    \n370.  Mangani relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, Mangani \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nPrakash Moses Kanagiah Manonmoni \n371.  In or about June 2006, Manonmoni saw an advertisement in an Indian newspaper \nannouncing a program under which pipefitters could work in the United States and receive green \ncards.  Manonmoni called the number in the advertisement and spoke to Salimon, who told him \nto attend an informational meeting in August 2006. \n372.  At this meeting, Salimon explained that Signal would process permanent \nresidency visas for the workers.  He stated that each worker would have to pay 850,000 rupees \n 80 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 84 of 158\n(approximately $18,700) plus airfare to the United States.  Salimon asked interested workers to \nsign a contract at the meeting, and said that they would be contacted about a test and an \ninterview.  Manonmoni handed his signed contract to Dewan. \n373.  Later that month, Manonmoni was invited to an interview attended by Salimon, \nDewan, Pol, and a Signal project manager.  During this meeting, he also took and passed a \nwritten pipefittersโ examination.   \n374.  Manonmoni ultimately paid Dewan, Pol, and Burnett 600,000 rupees \n(approximately $13,320) in โrecruitment fees,โ plus approximately 170,000 rupees \n(approximately $3,673) in travel and other expenses.  In order to pay these fees, Manonmoni sold \na parcel of land that he owned.  He also took out two loans using his wifeโs jewelry and his life \ninsurance policy as collateral. \n375.  Just before Manonmoni flew to the United States, he traveled to Dewanโs office \nand paid his final payment.  That day, Dewan assured Manonmoni that if he followed Signalโs \nrules, Manonmoni would receive a green card. \n376.  When Manonmoni arrived in the United States, he was told that Signal would \ndeduct $245 a week from his salary for accommodations, regardless of whether he lived at the \nman camp.  Because he could not afford to repay his loans and pay room and board twice, he felt \nthat he had no choice but to live at the camp.  Manonmoni was also afraid to leave Signal or \ncomplain about the conditions, because he knew that he could not return to India and still repay \nhis loans.   \n377.  In addition, Manonmoni believed that if he continued to work at Signal and do a \ngood job, he would receive his green card.  In or about December 2006, Manonmoni attended a \ncamp meeting at which Burnett stated that Signal would secure visa extensions and green cards \n 81 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 85 of 158\nfor the workers.  In addition, throughout Manonmoniโs time at Signal, John Sanders told him and \nother workers that Signal would โtake careโ of their green cards. \n378.  Manonmoni relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, \nManonmoni felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nAdharsan Manuel \n379.  In or about June 2006, Manuel saw an advertisement in an Indian newspaper \noffering positions for welders in the United States and the opportunity to receive a green card.  \nManuel called the number listed in the advertisement and spoke with Salimon, who told him to \nattend a meeting at a hotel. \n380.  During this meeting, at which Dewan, Salimon, and Pol were present, Dewan told \nManuel and other prospective workers that they would travel to the United States on H-2B visas \nto work at Signal.  Shortly thereafter, Manuel met with Dewan at his office, where Dewan \nexplained that Manuel would also be able to receive a green card if he took the job at Signal. \n381.  On or about November 7, 2007, Manuel met with Salimon, Dewan, and Burnett to \ndiscuss his upcoming interview at the United States Consulate.  They instructed Manuel not to \nmention Signalโs promise that he would receive a green card during his consular interview, \nthough Dewan and Burnett assured him that it would be taken care of once he arrived in the \nUnited States. \n 82 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 86 of 158\n382.  Manuel paid approximately 700,000 rupees (approximately $15,000) to Dewan, \nPol, and Burnett for the opportunity to work for Signal.  In order to raise this money, Manuel \ndepleted his savings and secured a loan at approximately 4 percent interest by offering his \nsisterโs and wifeโs dowries as collateral.   \n383.  After he arrived in the United States, Manuel learned for the first time that he had \nto pay $35 per day for accommodations that were much worse than any he had ever experienced.   \n384.  Despite the squalid living conditions and the unsafe work environment, Manuel \nfelt compelled to remain at Signal.  He was afraid that if he left, he would be sent back to India \nand would not receive the green card he had been promised.  Manuel believed that remaining at \nSignal was the only option that would allow him to repay his substantial debt, because he could \nnever earn enough money to repay that debt in India.  Manuel also felt compelled to remain \nbecause of Signalโs conduct.  Signal foremen constantly monitored Manuelโeven when he went \nto the bathroomโand threatened to notify the police and immigration officials if Manuel left \nSignal.  Signal employee John Sanders threatened to send Manuel and other workers back to \nIndia if they complained about the conditions at the man camp.  Manuel also feared that Signal \nemployees or Dewan might retaliate against him or his family if he left or complained about the \nhorrible conditions. \n385.  Manuel received repeated assurances from Signal personnel throughout early-to-\nmid 2007 that he would receive his green card.  In addition, in or about March 2007, Burnett and \nDewan traveled to Signal and met with the workers, assuring them that Signal was processing \ntheir green cards. \n386.  Manuel relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \n 83 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 87 of 158\nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, Manuel \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nJacob Mazhukkattu Mathew \n387.  In or about June 2006, J.M. Mathew read a newspaper advertisement offering \ntemporary and permanent work visas and employment with a marine company in Mississippi and \nTexas.  He called Dewan Consultants and spoke with Salimon, who invited him to a meeting at a \nhotel. \n388.  Approximately one week later, J.M. Mathew attended the meeting, where Dewan, \nSalimon, and Burnett were present.  At this meeting, Burnett said that the workers would travel \nto the United States on H-2B visas.  The workers would receive green cards after the H-2B visas \nhad been extended.  Dewan explained that this process would cost 600,000 rupees \n(approximately $13,000).  After the presentation, J.M. Mathew spoke separately with Burnett, \nwho assured Mathew that his wife could also come to the United States after he received a green \ncard.  An employee of Dewan Consultants also assured J.M. Mathew that he could bring his wife \nand family to the United States after obtaining a green card, which the employee claimed would \noccur within two years.  J.M. Mathew also spoke with Salimon and asked him about the \naccommodations at Signal.  Salimon said that two workers would share each room and that food \nand accommodations would be free. \n389.  Soon thereafter, J.M. Mathew took a skills test in the presence of Dewan, \nSalimon, and two Signal employees.  The Signal employees supervised the test and told J.M. \nMathew that he had passed. \n 84 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 88 of 158\n390.  In order to raise the 600,000 rupees that J.M. Mathew paid to Dewan, Pol, and \nBurnett, J.M. Mathewโs mother-in-law borrowed 125,000 rupees (approximately $2,693), \nposting her home and land as collateral.  J.M. Mathew mortgaged his home and land and \nborrowed the remainder at an interest rate of approximately 12 or 13 percent per year.  J.M. \nMathew paid Agents three fee payments in or about and between August and November of 2006. \n391.  In or about December 2006, J.M. Mathew traveled to Dewanโs office where he \npaid his final fee payment.  There, he learned that Signal would deduct $35 per day from his \npaycheck for room and board.  Although he believed that this amount was too high, he felt that \nhe had no choice but to continue with the process because he had already paid Dewan, Burnett, \nand Pol a substantial amount of money that he could not recover. \n392.  In the United States, J.M. Mathew remained at Signal because he continued to \nbelieve that he would receive a green card.  J.M. Mathew met regularly with Sanders and other \nSignal employees to discuss his immigration concerns, and he attended a number of meetings at \nwhich Signal and the Agents discussed green cards.  In or about early 2007, Dewan spoke at two \nseparate meetings and stated that workers would receive green cards.  During this same time \nperiod, Burnett also came to Signal and promised the workers green cards.   In addition, on or \nabout March 8, 2007, a Signal Vice President called a meeting and assured Mathew and other \nworkers that they would receive green cards soon. \n393.  J.M. Mathew was also afraid to leave Signal because if he returned to India, he \nwould not be able to repay his debts and would lose his house and land, as well as his mother-in-\nlawโs house and land.  He felt trapped.  He could not travel from the man camp without \ntransportation provided by Signal. He felt that he could not even criticize Signalโs treatment of \nhimself and other Indian workers due to Signalโs threats of deportation.  \n 85 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 89 of 158\n394.  J.M. Mathew relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, J.M. \nMathew felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nJohny Mathew \n395.  In or about March 2006, J. Mathew saw a newspaper advertisement in India \noffering welding jobs in the United States and the possibility of receiving a green card.  J. \nMathew called Dewan Consultants in response to the advertisement. \n396.  In or about May 2006, J. Mathew attended a meeting led by Dewan, Pol, Burnett, \nand Salimon.  At this meeting, Dewan explained that workers would travel to the United States \non 10-to-11 month H-2B visas, which would be extended three times.  During this time, Signal \nwould apply for green cards for the workers.  Dewan also stated that the workers would \neventually be able to settle permanently with their families in the United States.  Visa and green \ncard processing would cost 750,000 rupees (approximately $16,750).    \n397.  In or about May or June 2006, J. Mathew attended and passed a skills test, at \nwhich both Salimon and Dewan were present. \n398.  J. Mathew later met with Burnett, who reiterated that J. Mathew would first \nreceive an H-2B visa and would then get a green card.  At this meeting, J. Mathew signed an \nagreement with Signal, which Salimon interpreted for him, and which J. Mathew believed to \npromise that he would receive a green card.   \n 86 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 90 of 158\n399.  J. Mathew ultimately quit his job and paid almost 700,000 rupees (approximately \n$15,633) to Dewan, Pol, and Burnett in approximately three installments.  In order to raise this \nmoney, J. Mathew sold his wifeโs wedding jewelry, used additional money that he had saved to \nbuy a house, and took out a loan at 12 percent monthly interest.  In or about the fall of 2006, J. \nMathew refused a job in Kazakhstan so that he could stay in India and complete the necessary \nsteps to receive his visa and green card. \n400.  In or about late November 2006, a few days before his flight to the United States, \nJ. Mathew traveled to Dewanโs office.  Dewanโs staff forced him to sign several documents in a \nrushed manner and did not give him time to read or understand the documents.  Dewan also \ndemanded that J. Mathew return to Dewan his copy of the original signed agreement that \npromised him a green card, as well any receipts and papers related to the Signal opportunity.  \nWhen J. Mathew hesitated, Dewan said that J. Mathew would not be able to go to the United \nStates unless he returned the documents.  Dewan refused to give J. Mathew his passport and \nplane ticket until he returned these documents to Dewan. \n401.  After arriving at Signal, J. Mathew attended two or three meetings in or about \nearly-to-mid 2007 at which Burnett promised that Signal would process the workersโ green \ncards.  J. Mathew also attended a meeting, in or about March 2007, at which Dewan stated that \nthe workers would receive green cards.   \n402.  Despite these promises, J. Mathew was very unhappy at Signal.  The living and \nworking conditions were terrible, and Signal deducted $35 from his pay each day for room and \nboard.   \n403.  J. Mathew felt trapped and unable to leave Signal.  He was afraid that if he were \nsent back to India, he and his family would be thrust into poverty because of the debt he had \n 87 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 91 of 158\nincurred.  He was also afraid that he would suffer mistreatment at the hands of Dewan and his \nassociates. \n404.  J. Mathew relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, J. Mathew \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nNandhakumar Nagaraj \n405.  In or about May or June of 2006, a friend of Nagaraj told him about a newspaper \nadvertisement offering the opportunity to obtain an H-2B visa and green card.  Nagaraj \nresponded to the advertisement and called Salimon.  Salimon confirmed that Nagaraj and other \nworkers could obtain H-2B visas and green cards and told Nagaraj to attend a meeting in \napproximately three weeks to learn more.   \n406.  Dewan, Salimon, Burnett, and Pol were present at this meeting.  They explained \nthat workers would travel to the United States on H-2B visas, and that during this time, Signal \nwould process their green card applications.  \n407.  Approximately one month after the meeting, Nagaraj took a welding test \nadministered by an American.  Approximately one month after the test, Nagaraj met with \nSalimon at a hotel.  Salimon told Nagaraj that he could obtain an H-2B visa and work in the \nUnited States for ten months.  After ten months, Nagaraj would automatically receive a green \ncard and could bring his family to the United States. \n 88 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 92 of 158\n408.  Nagaraj ultimately paid Dewan, Pol, and Burnett 800,000 rupees (approximately \n$17,787) for this opportunity.  Nagaraj borrowed approximately three-fourths of these fees at a \nmonthly interest rate of 10 percent.  He also depleted his savings and sold property and jewelry \nthat his mother had received for her wedding from Nagarajโs grandfather.   \n409.  Just before Nagaraj left for the United States, he traveled to Dewanโs office in \nMumbai.  Dewan refused to give Nagaraj his passport until Nagaraj had paid the final installment \nand signed various documents.  Nagaraj asked if he could read the documents, but Dewan \nrefused and insisted that Nagaraj sign quickly so that he would not miss his flight to the United \nStates.  \n410.  After arriving in the United States, Nagaraj learned that Signal would deduct $245 \nfrom his paycheck each week for room and board.  When he asked Signal employees if he could \nlive outside the man camp, he was told that he was not permitted to live elsewhere.  Nagaraj felt \ncompelled to remain at Signalโs man camp because he would not be able to repay his substantial \ndebt if he was required to pay additional money for housing and food. \n411.  Nagaraj attended a meeting in which Dewan promised Nagaraj and other Indian \nworkers that they would receive green cards if they continued to work at Signal. \n412.  Nagaraj relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, Nagaraj \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \n 89 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 93 of 158\nShaji Veluthalakuzhiyil Nanoo \n413.  In or about April or May of 2006, Nanoo saw a newspaper advertisement placed \nby Dewan Consultants offering the opportunity for welders and pipefitters to work in the United \nStates, and promising green cards and legal status for the workers and their families.  Nanoo \ncalled the phone number listed in the advertisement and spoke to Salimon.  Salimon said that the \nopportunity would include green card processing and that the process would cost 530,000 rupees \n(approximately $11,850). \n414.  In or about May 2006, Nanoo traveled to Cochin, India for an interview and skills \ntest attended by Salimon and Dewan.  At the interview, Salimon said that Signal would apply for \nNanooโs green card once he arrived in the United States. Soon thereafter, at a meeting attended \nby Pol, Burnett, Dewan, and Salimon, Burnett also assured Nanoo that Signal would begin to \nprocess his green card once he arrived in the United States.  \n415.  Nanoo faced considerable difficulties raising the money that he ultimately paid to \nDewan, Pol, and Burnett.  He mortgaged his land at approximately 12 percent interest and used \njewelry belonging to his wife, sister, and sister-in-law as collateral for an additional loan.  He \nalso sold more family jewelry.  Nonetheless, he was still unable to raise the total amount \nrequired. \n416.  Before he was scheduled to leave for the United States, Nanoo visited Dewanโs \noffice to pay his final fee installments and collect his ticket.  Nanoo signed various documents, \nbut because Dewanโs assistants rushed him, he did not have a chance to read or understand what \nhe was signing. \n417.  Before Nanoo was able to collect his ticket and passport, Dewanโs assistants \ndetermined that Nanoo still owed a portion of his fees.  Dewan refused to give Nanoo his \npassport until he had paid the remainder of the fees.  Nanoo called his brother-in-law, who \n 90 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 94 of 158\nhelped him raise some additional money.  Only after Nanoo paid the full amount demanded by \nthe Agents was he allowed to board the next flight to the United States.  \n418.  In the United States, Nanoo learned that Signal would deduct $245 per week for \nfood and housing from his paycheck, regardless of whether he lived in the man camp.  Despite \nthe terrible living conditions, the fees that Signal charged him made it prohibitively expensive to \nlive elsewhere. \n419.  Nanooโs debt also made him feel compelled him to continue to endure the unsafe \nworking conditions at Signal.  Once, after Nanoo complained that the ships he worked on were \nunsafe, a Signal foreman suspended Nanoo for six days without pay.  Nanoo knew that other \nIndian workers had experienced threats, retaliation, and deportation when they expressed their \nconcerns about the conditions.  Nanoo feared that if he were sent back to India, he would not be \nable to repay his debt, he would lose the land that he had mortgaged, and he and his family \nwould become homeless.  He was also worried that Dewan or his associates would hurt him or \nhis family.   \n420.  Nanoo relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, Nanoo \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \n 91 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 95 of 158\nMangalan Chandrasekharan Pillai \n421.  In or about June 2006, M. Pillai saw an advertisement in a Dubai newspaper \noffering the opportunity for pipefitters to work in the United States and receive green cards.  The \nadvertisement invited interested workers to attend a meeting at a Dubai hotel.   \n422.  At this meeting, Dewan explained that Signal was looking for Indian workers to \ntravel to the United States under H-2B visas to repair oil rigs.  The H-2B visas would be renewed \ntwo to three times.  After that, the workers would receive green cards and would be able to bring \ntheir families to the United States.  Dewan also explained that workers would be required to pay \nBurnett, Pol, and Dewan visa and green card processing fees. \n423.  M. Pillai later took a skills test.  When he was notified that he had passed, he \nreturned to the hotel.  There, Dewan gave him a letter stating that M. Pillai would receive an H-\n2B visa and green card in exchange for processing fees. \n424.  M. Pillai ultimately paid approximately 600,000 rupees (approximately $13,056) \nto Burnett, Pol, and Dewan.  In order to raise this money, M. Pillai pawned his motherโs and \nwifeโs jewelry and borrowed money from a friend.  M. Pillai also took out two loans at 7 to 10 \npercent monthly interest, and an additional loan at 18 percent annual interest. \n425.  In or about November 2006, M. Pillai traveled to Dewanโs office to pay the final \ninstallments of his fees and receive his passport.  After he gave the money to Dewanโs brother, \nDewanโs associates rushed him out of the office before he could ask any questions or ask for a \nreceipt. \n426.  After arriving in the United States, M. Pillai learned for the first time about the \nterrible living and working conditions and the substantial deduction that Signal took from each \nworkerโs paycheck for accommodations.  M. Pillai did not complain about the living and \nworking conditions, however, because he saw that Signal threatened to deport workers who \n 92 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 96 of 158\nโcaused trouble.โ  M. Pillai also feared that if he were sent back to India, he would be unable to \nrepay his debts.  He had attended meetings in which Signal officials had promised that the \nworkers would receive green cards, and he believed that his continued employment in the United \nStates was the only way he could repay his debts. \n427.  M. Pillai relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.

Pillai saw an advertisement in a local Indian paper \noffering job opportunities for pipefitters in the United States.  He called the number in the \nadvertisement and eventually met with Salimon.  Salimon told R. Pillai that Signal would begin \nhis green card application when he arrived in the United States, and that the process would take \napproximately ten months. \n429.  In or about June or July 2006, R. Pillai traveled to Cochin, India for an interview \nand skills test.  Salimon and another representative of Signal reaffirmed that Signal would apply \nfor R. Pillaiโs green card. \n430.  R. Pillai also attended a meeting in October 2006, at which Salimon, Dewan, and \nat least one other Agent were present.  They explained that as soon as the workers began working \nin the United States, Signal would begin their green card applications.  The process would take \napproximately ten months, at the end of which the workers would be able to bring their families \n 93 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 97 of 158\nto the United States.  At the October meeting, R. Pillai was required to sign several documents.  \nThe Agents told him that he had to sign each document to come to the United States, but they did \nnot explain the contents of the documents, and R. Pillai did not understand what they said. \n431.  R. Pillai left a well-paying job as a pipe-fitting supervisor and ultimately paid Pol, \nBurnett, and Dewan approximately 900,000 rupees (approximately $19,855) in โrecruitment \nfees.โ  To raise the money for these fees, R. Pillai took out three loans at 8.5 percent monthly \ninterest, secured by his brotherโs house and all of his familyโs jewelry. \n432.  On or about November 17, 2006, R. Pillai met with Dewan to collect his plane \nticket.  At this meeting, he signed additional documents that were not explained to him.  Dewan \nalso demanded that R. Pillai relinquish all of his documents relating to the Signal opportunity.   \nFearing that he would lose all the money he paid to Dewan and would not be able to work at \nSignal, R. Pillai complied.   \n433.  When he arrived in the United States, R. Pillai was appalled by the unsanitary \nliving conditions, the unsafe work environment, Signalโs discriminatory behavior, and the \nsubstantial fees Signal required him to pay for room and board.  He also developed a bad cough \nfrom sleeping near the ventilator in his trailer, which still bothers him to this day.  R. Pillai felt \nhe had no choice but to endure these conditions and continue to work for Signal, however, \nbecause he was afraid that if he complained, he would be sent back to India, where he would be \nunable to repay the debt he had incurred to pay Dewan, Pol, and Burnett.  Signal officials also \ncontinued to promise him that they would process all of his paperwork. \n434.  R. Pillai relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \n 94 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 98 of 158\nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, R. Pillai \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nAby Molathu Poulose \n435.  In or about March or April of 2006, A. Poulose saw an advertisement in a Dubai \nnewspaper that promised an opportunity to work in the United States and to obtain an H-2B visa \nand a green card.  A. Poulose called Dewan Consultants and was told to attend a meeting in \nDubai. \n436.  At that meeting, Dewan explained that workers hired by Signal would travel to \nthe United States on H-2B visas and would receive green cards within nine to nineteen months.  \nDewan explained that this process would cost 700,000 rupees (approximately $15,764) and that, \nin the United States, the workers would earn 250,000 rupees (approximately $5,630) per month \nafter taxes.  Dewan also told A. Poulose that workers from Signal would be coming to India to \nadminister employment tests.   \n437.  Soon after the meeting, A. Poulose called Dewan to ask if he could meet Signalโs \nrepresentatives in India for the job testing.  Dewan agreed. \n438.  At the test, Signal personnel explained to A. Poulose that Signal was the โnumber \none shipyardโ in America and that Signal had sufficient political power that A. Poulose need not \nto worry about his visa.  They also assured A. Poulose that Signal would apply for his green card \nand that it would be processed while A. Poulose was working in the United States.   \n439.  In or about August 2006, A. Poulose attended another meeting at which Burnett, \nDewan, and Salimon were present.  Burnett told A. Poulose and other workers that he was a \n 95 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 99 of 158\nfamous immigration lawyer and that 600 H-2B visas with green cards had been approved for \nSignal. \n440.  A. Poulose ultimately left his job in Dubai and paid almost 800,000 rupees \n(approximately $18,061) to Dewan, Pol, and Burnett.  In order to raise this sum, A. Poulose \nborrowed 300,000 rupees (approximately $7,038) at 11 percent interest using his parentsโ house \nand land as collateral.  Because he was unable to secure money elsewhere, A. Poulose and his \nfamily eventually sold this property to finance the balance of his โrecruitment fees.โ  \nNonetheless, by the time he was scheduled to depart for the United States, A. Poulose still \nneeded to raise an additional 20,000 rupees (approximately $450).   \n441.  On the morning of A. Pouloseโs flight to the United States, Dewan threatened to \nburn A. Pouloseโs passport unless A. Poulose paid the missing 20,000 rupees.  He stated that he \nwould not refund any of the money that A. Poulose had paid.  A. Poulose ultimately paid the full \namount after his father offered Dewan the money that he intended to use to pay rent that month.   \n442.  Before Dewan gave A. Poulose his passport, he required A. Poulose to sign \npaperwork.  A. Poulose did not have time to read the documents because his flight would leave \nsoon. \n443.  After arriving in the United States, A. Poulose felt compelled to remain at Signal.  \nHis H-2B visa prevented him from working for another employer in the United States, and he \ncould not earn enough money to repay his debts if he returned to India.  He also believed \nDefendantsโ continued assurances that he would obtain a green card.  Consequently, he felt that \nhe had no choice but to continue working for Signal, despite the deplorable conditions. \n444.  A. Poulose relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \n 96 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 100 of 158\nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, A. \nPoulose felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nJustin Poulose \n445.  In or about the summer of 2006, J. Poulose was working as a welder in Kerala, \nIndia, when he saw a newspaper advertisement offering jobs for welders and pipefitters at Signal.  \nThe advertisement mentioned green cards and said that workers could obtain visas that would \nallow them to travel to the United States immediately.  J. Poulose called the phone number listed \nin the advertisement and spoke to Salimon.  Salimon told J. Poulose that he could learn more \nabout the immigration process and job opportunity at a meeting.   \n446.  J. Poulose attended the meeting that week.  He met with Pol, who was introduced \nan official of the American company recruiting workers.  He also met with Dewan and Salimon.  \nPol explained that J. Poulose could work for Signal.  Pol said that J. Poulose would travel to the \nUnited States on an H-2B visa and would obtain permanent residency status within one year, at \nwhich point he would be able to bring his family.  Pol also stated that J. Poulose could earn \naround $16 to $19 per hour at Signal. \n447.  At the meeting, Dewan and Salimon explained that this process would cost \n800,000 rupees (approximately $18,000).  J. Poulose felt that this would be a good opportunity, \nbut he was worried that he would not be able to afford the fees. \n448.  Approximately four to six weeks later, a woman from Salimonโs office called J. \nPoulose.  She explained that the fees could be reduced to 650,000 rupees (approximately \n$14,163).  She told J. Poulose that he should obtain the money and take a skills test.  J. Poulose \n 97 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 101 of 158\nwas hesitant, but based on the salary he had been promised, he believed that he would be able to \nafford the lower price and repay his debts. \n449.  On or about July 5, 2006, J. Poulose took and passed a skills test administered by \nSignal representatives.  Dewan and Salimon were also present.  Dewan said that J. Poulose \nwould be able to receive permanent residency status in the United States.  At a later meeting, \nSalimon also gave J. Poulose a letter promising employment at Signal, an H-2B visa, and \npermanent residency. \n450.  To raise the 650,000 rupees that he paid to Dewan, Pol, and Burnett, J. Poulose \ntook out multiple loans, including two with monthly interest rates of approximately 10.5 \npercent.  He used his motherโs wedding jewelry as collateral for one of these loans, and the deeds \nto his familyโs house and land as collateral for the other.  He also took out a third loan with a \nmonthly interest rate of approximately 6 percent.  J. Poulose paid all three fee installments \ntotaling approximately 650,000 rupees by November 2006. \n451.  On the morning of J. Pouloseโs flight to the United States, he traveled to Dewanโs \noffice in Mumbai to obtain his passport.  The office was crowded, and J. Poulose was forced to \nwait in a long line before he could meet with anyone.  Eventually, J. Poulose met with a Dewan \nConsultants employee who insisted that J. Poulose quickly sign paperwork written in \nEnglish.  The employee rushed J. Poulose to sign and did not give him time to read the \ndocuments, emphasizing that his flight would leave soon and that there were several people in \nthe office.  At the same time, J. Poulose saw Dewan threaten a worker who did not have enough \nmoney to make his final payment to Dewan.  Dewan told the worker that he could not go to the \nUnited States and stapled his passport shut.  This made J. Poulose nervous, and he felt pressured \n 98 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 102 of 158\nto sign immediately.  Only after he signed the documents did he receive his passport and plane \nticket.  \n452.  After J. Poulose arrived in the United States, he learned that Signal was deducting \n$35 per day from his paycheck.  Signalโs camp manager informed J. Poulose that the company \nwould deduct this amount from his wages even if J. Poulose lived outside of the man \ncamp.  Because he could not afford to repay his substantial debt and pay room and board outside \nthe man camp with these deductions, J. Poulose felt compelled to remain at the man camp. \n453.  Months later, Signal held a camp meeting where Dewan, Burnett, Sanders, \nSnyder, and other officials were present.  Both Dewan and Burnett assured J. Poulose and other \nworkers that they would receive their visa extensions and that Signal would continue with their \ngreen card processing.  Dewan warned, however, that the workers had to follow Signalโs \ninstructions at all times if they did not want to be deported.  After this meeting, J. Poulose feared \nthat if he did anything to make Signal management unhappy, he would be deported and would \nnot be able to repay his debts.   This caused J. Poulose to suffer severe mental stress. \n454.  On or about March 10, 2007, J. Poulose attended a camp meeting led by John \nSanders.  Sanders assured J. Poulose and other workers that if they followed Signalโs rules, they \nwould receive green cards.  However, if they organized against Signal, then they would not be \nable to stay.  After the meeting, J. Poulose saw notices on the man campโs notice board \ninstructing workers to bring documents to an office at the camp in order to obtain green cards.  J. \nPoulose followed these instructions, and as a result believed that his visa would be extended. \n455.  In or about July of 2007, J. Poulose again met with Burnett.  Burnett told J. \nPoulose that if he continued to work for Signal, his H-2B visa could be extended, and it would \n 99 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 103 of 158\neventually be possible to file a green card application.  Based on this promise, J. Poulose \ncontinued to work at Signal. \n456.  J. Poulose relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, J. \nPoulose felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nAppunni Arul Prakash \n457.  In or about April of 2006, Prakashโs wife told him about a job advertisement \noffering work as a welder or fitter in the United States and the opportunity to obtain a green card \nwithin 18 to 24 months.  Prakash called Dewan Consultants and spoke to a representative who \nsaid that he could work at Signal and obtain a green card.  The representative said that this \nprocess would cost about 700,000 rupees (approximately $15,650), and invited Prakash to attend \na general meeting in May.   \n458.  At the May 2006 meeting, Dewan explained that Prakash and other workers \nwould work for Signal.  Pol stated that Signal would file for green cards within 18 to 24 months, \nand that after the workers received their green cards, they would return to India then go back to \nAmerica with their families.  Pol and Dewan also assured those at the meeting that the green card \nprocessing would proceed as promised.   Pol stated that this process would cost workers 700,000 \nrupees (approximately $15,650); Salimon repeated this price as well. \n 100 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 104 of 158\n459.  In or about August 2006, Prakash attended another meeting where Dewan, \nSalimon, and Burnett were present.  Burnett explained that Prakash would receive a green card \nwithin 24 months and that he could bring his family to the United States.   \n460.  In or about November 2006, Prakash attended another meeting with Burnett, \nDewan, Salimon, and Sanders.  Burnett explained that Prakash would travel to the United States \non an H-2B visa, which Signal would extend twice.  Prakash would then receive a green card.  \nSanders also assured Prakash that Signal would take care of his visa. \n461.  Prakash ultimately paid the 700,000 rupees demanded by the Agents.  To raise \nthis money, Prakashโs family mortgaged their home and land in exchange for a loan of about \n400,000 rupees (approximately $9000) at twelve percent monthly interest.  Prakash obtained \nanother loan of approximately 100,000 rupees (approximately $2,250) at a monthly interest rate \nof approximately 23 percent.  He also borrowed 150,000 to 200,000 rupees (approximately \n$3300 to $4500) at 9 or 10 percent interest using as collateral jewelry that his wife and sister had \nreceived for their weddings, and that had significant sentimental value. \n462.  On the day of Prakashโs flight to the United States, he traveled to Dewanโs office \nin Mumbai to obtain his passport and plane ticket.  Dewan demanded that Prakash return to \nDewan his copies of original signed agreements.  When Prakash resisted, Dewan threatened that \nPrakash would not receive his passport or plane ticket.  While Prakash was waiting at the office, \nhe saw Dewan threaten to burn another workerโs passport until that man paid Dewan the \nremaining money that Dewan demanded.  Prakash therefore feared that he would not be able to \ntravel to the United States unless he gave Dewan his paperwork.  Prakash gave Dewan all of his \noriginal documents.  Dewan then insisted that Prakash sign paperwork written in English if \nPrakash wanted to receive his passport or plane ticket.  Dewan also demanded that Prakash give \n 101 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 105 of 158\nhim all of his paperwork relating to the Signal opportunity.  When Prakash resisted, Dewan said \nthat unless Prakash complied, he would withhold Prakashโs passport and Prakash would not \nreceive a refund for the money he had already paid.  Prakash feared that he would lose this \nmoney and miss his flight, so he gave Dewan the documents he had with him and quickly signed \nthe paperwork without understanding what it said. \n463.  Although Prakash knew Signal would be deducting money from his paycheck for \nroom and board before he left India, he did not realize until he arrived at Signal that the amount \nto be deducted was almost $1,050 per month.  Because of Prakashโs heavy debt burden and \nbecause he would have to pay this amount even if he lived outside of the man camp, he felt that \nhe had no choice but to continue living at the man camp.  Prakash also felt compelled to remain \nat Signal because Signal assured him that he could obtain a green card if he stayed and \nperformed well.  In particular, in or about March 2007, Prakash attended a meeting at which \nBurnett told the workers that if they behaved well and worked hard, they would receive green \ncards.  If they caused trouble, however, they would be fired.  Prakash feared being sent back to \nIndia, because he believed that he would not be able to earn enough money there to repay his \ndebts.   \n464.  Prakash relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would soon adverse immigration action against him, Prakash \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \n 102 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 106 of 158\nNibu Raju \n465.  In or about May or June of 2006, Raju was in India on a break from his job in \nDubai when he saw a newspaper advertisement offering the opportunity to work as a welder or \nfitter in the United States and obtain and H-2B visa and permanent residency.  Raju called the \nphone number listed on the advertisement and spoke to an employee of Aravind Associates, a \nsub-agency of Dewan Consultants.  The employee informed Raju that he would travel to United \nStates on an H-2B visa and would then obtain a green card that would allow him and his family \nto become permanent residents of the United States.  She told Raju to call Salimon the next day \nfor additional information. \n466.  Raju called Salimon, who reiterated that Raju could work in the United States and \nobtain an H-2B visa and permanent residency.  When Raju explained that he would soon return \nto Dubai for work, Salimon told Raju to contact Dewan Consultantsโ Dubai office and attend an \ninterview in Dubai in June. \n467.  Raju attended the interview, at which Dewan and two Signal employees were \npresent.  Raju took a written test, which a Signal employee informed him that he had passed. \n468.  Raju also spoke with Dewan, who explained that Raju would travel to the United \nStates on an H-2B visa, and that Rajuโs employer, Signal, would handle Rajuโs green card \nprocessing.  Dewan also explained this process would cost approximately $18,000. \n469.  Between approximately June and November 2006, Raju paid this amount in \ninstallments to Pol, Burnett, and Dewan.  To raise this money, Raju and his family borrowed \n600,000 rupees (approximately $13,068) from a bank, at a monthly interest rate of approximately \n7.5 percent.  Raju also borrowed about 100,000 rupees (approximately $2,179) from a friend, at a \nmonthly interest rate of approximately 3 percent.  Raju borrowed additional money from another \n 103 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 107 of 158\nfriend.  To pay the remainder of the fees, Raju sold his motherโs and cousinโs gold jewelry, \nincluding jewelry that his mother had received as a wedding gift. \n470.  On or about August 22, 2006, Raju met with Dewan and Burnett at Dewanโs \nDubai office.  Dewan introduced Burnett as Signalโs lawyer.  Burnett explained that Raju and \nother workers would obtain green cards and be able to bring their families to the United States.  \nAs a result, Raju signed an agreement that day. \n471.  On or about August 29, 2006, Raju traveled to Dewanโs Dubai office to pay a fee \ninstallment.  Raju again asked Dewan if he would receive a green card, and Dewan assured Raju \nthat he would. \n472.  On or about November 7, 2006, the day before Rajuโs interview at the United \nStates Consulate, Raju met with Salimon and Dewan.  Dewan repeatedly told Raju that he would \nnot receive a refund if he failed his interview.  After the interview, Dewan emphasized that Raju \nmust pay the remainder of the money that he owed Dewan in order to go to the United States. \n473.  In or about the middle of November of 2006, Salimon called Raju and told him to \nbe ready to travel to United States on November 29, 2006.  Salimon told Raju to bring his final \nfee installment and all the documents relating to the job at Signal to Dewanโs Mumbai office. \n474.  On or about November 29, 2006, Raju traveled to Dewanโs office in Mumbai.  \nApproximately 50 other Indian workers were waiting, and Dewan called each worker \nindividually into a room.  When Raju met with Dewan, Dewan required Raju to sign a number of \ndocuments.  Dewan refused to give Raju time to read the documents and emphasized he would \nmiss his flight unless he signed quickly.  Dewan also demanded that Raju give Dewan all of his \ndocuments relating to the Signal opportunity.  Raju refused at first, but Dewan told him that he \ncould not travel to the United States unless he gave Dewan the paperwork.  Because he had \n 104 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 108 of 158\nalready given Dewan so much money and had mortgaged his parentsโ home, Raju felt that he had \nno choice but to sign the documents and give Dewan his paperwork.  Dewan then gave Raju his \npassport, and Raju left for the airport and flew to the United States. \n475.  After arriving in Mississippi, Signal employees and officials repeatedly promised \nRaju that he would receive a green card.  For example, when Raju explained to his foreman that \nhe had incurred substantial debt to work at Signal, the foreman assured Raju that Signal would \napply for a green card for him.  Raju also attended several meetings at which Burnett and John \nSanders promised the workers green cards.  During a meeting in or about January or February of \n2007, Dewan and Burnett told the workers that they would receive green cards and urged the \nworkers to continue working at Signal.  On or about March 8, 2007, Sanders and other Signal \nofficials, including Signalโs Vice President, held another meeting.  The Signal officials told Raju \nand other workers that they would receive green cards.  Based on these repeated promises of \ngreen cards and the substantial debt he had incurred to finance his trip to the United States, Raju \ncontinued working at Signal. \n476.  Raju also felt compelled to continue living at the man camp because Signal \ndeducted $35 each day from his paycheck for room and board, which made it financially \nimpossible for Raju to live elsewhere.  Signal officials told Raju that he could go back to India if \nhe did not like living at the man camp. \n477.  Several months after Raju began working at the man camp, Signal told him and \nother workers that Signal would re-test all the Indian workers.  If anyone failed their test, Signal \nwould reduce their salary by one-half. \n478.  After the March 2007 incident during which a number of workers were deported, \nRaju began to fear that Signal would deport him.  He told his father about the incident, and his \n 105 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 109 of 158\nfather called Salimon.  Salimon threatened Rajuโs father, saying that if he continued to ask \nquestions, Raju would experience the same fate as the worker who had tried to commit suicide.  \nWhen Rajuโs father told Raju about his conversation with Salimon, Raju became even more \nafraid that Signal would arrange for his deportation. \n479.  Raju relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good working \nconditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work for Signal \nin the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by Signal, his \nneed to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ โrecruitment \nfees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, and his fear that \nSignal or Burnett would soon adverse immigration action against him, Raju felt intimidated into \nacquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nSreenivasarao Raparthy  \n480.  On or about June 26, 2006, Raparthy learned from a friend about newspaper \nadvertisements offering the opportunity to work as a welder or pipefitter at an American \nshipyard.  In response to the advertisement, Raparthy attended an interview session, where \nDewan and Burnett were present.  At the interview session, Dewan and Burnett told him that if \nhe worked in the United States, he could obtain an H-2B visa and then a green card. \n481.  The same day, Raparthy took a written test administered by Signal employees.  \nRaparthy passed the test, and the employees gave him paperwork promising an H-2B visa and \npermanent residency. \n482.  Approximately three days later, Raparthy attended a meeting with Dewan.  At that \nmeeting, Dewan assured Raparthy that he could travel to the United States on an H-2B visa.  \nDewan also told Raparthy that an H-2B visa extension and a green card application would be \n 106 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 110 of 158\nfiled without Raparthy needing to take additional steps.  Dewan gave Raparthy a document \nsigned by Burnett, which promised an H-2B visa and permanent residency. \n483.  Following Dewanโs instructions, Raparthy paid approximately 600,000 rupees \n(approximately $12,500) to Dewan, Burnett, and Pol.  To raise the money for these fees, \nRaparthy borrowed approximately 150,000 rupees from a bank at three percent monthly interest \nusing his wifeโs and motherโs gold jewelry as collateral.  He borrowed another 300,000 rupees at \nsix percent monthly interest.  He borrowed the balance from friends. \n484.  On the day of his flight to the United States, Dewanโs agents insisted that \nRaparthy sign additional paperwork if he wanted to receive his passport or plane ticket.  \nRaparthy asked if he could read the paperwork but was told that he would miss his flight if he \nreviewed the paperwork.  Raparthy signed, and only then received his passport and ticket. \n485.  After Raparthy arrived in the United States, he discovered that Signal deducted \napproximately $245 from his paycheck each week for room and board.  Raparthy asked Darrell \nSnyder and other Signal management if he could live outside the man camp, but Snyder told \nRaparthy that Signal would deduct the amount from his paycheck even if he lived elsewhere.  \nRaparthy felt compelled to continue living at the man camp because he could not afford to repay \nhis debt if Signal continued to deduct room and board and he paid for rent elsewhere. \n486.  Raparthy relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \n 107 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 111 of 158\nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, \nRaparthy felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nBalwinder Singh \n487.  B. Singh was recruited in or about 2006. \n488.  During meetings with Dewan and Burnett in India in or about mid-2006, Dewan \nand Burnett made numerous representations that led B. Singh to believe that in exchange for \npaying thousands of dollars in โrecruitment fees,โ Signal and the Agents would assist B. Singh \nwith applying for and receiving permanent residency in the United States.   \n489.  In reliance on these promises, B. Singh incurred substantial debt and paid \nthousands of dollars in โrecruitment feesโ to Dewan, Burnett, and Pol.   \n490.  After arriving in the United States, B. Singh felt compelled to remain at Signalโs \nman camp despite crowded housing because, among other reasons, Signal would deduct living \nexpenses from his paycheck even if he lived elsewhere, his H-2B visa did not permit him to work \nfor another U.S. employer, Signal constantly monitored the workers and threatened to deport \nthem if they complained about the horrible conditions at Signal, and he believed that he would \nface financial ruin and bankruptcy if he returned to India.  \n491.  B. Singh relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, B. \nSingh felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \n 108 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 112 of 158\nRanjit Singh \n492.  In or about May or June of 2006, R. Singh saw an advertisement in a Dubai \nnewspaper for a welding job at Signal.  The advertisement included Dewan Consultantsโ name \nand stated that permanent residency visas would be available for workers and families.  R. Singh \ncalled Dewanโs office and spoke with one of his employees, who told R. Singh to travel to the \nNew Delhi office with 40,000 rupees (approximately $873) to apply for the job. \n493.  At Dewanโs office, Dewanโs employee explained to R. Singh and approximately \ntwelve other applicants that they would travel to the United States on a visa, which would be \nextended, and that Signal would obtain green cards for the workers within two or three years.  \nThe employee assured them that American lawyers would handle the permanent residency visa \nprocess.  The employee also explained that the process would cost between 650,000 and 700,000 \nrupees (approximately $14,000 and $15,000) after travel expenses.  At another meeting \napproximately two weeks later and in subsequent conversations, the employee explained that R. \nSingh would pay the fees to Dewan, Burnett, and Pol. \n494.  R. Singh paid these โrecruitment feesโ in approximately three installments in or \nabout and between May and October of 2006.  To raise the money for the fees, R. Singh emptied \nhis savings, borrowed money from friends and his wifeโs parents, and sold his wifeโs jewelry.  R. \nSinghโs father also gave up title to two acres of property, which included his farm and home, in \nexchange for loans of totaling approximately 400,000 rupees (approximately $8,800). \n495.  After R. Singh had raised the money needed to pay the fees, he met with Dewan \nand Burnett.  They both assured R. Singh that he would receive a green card. \n496.    In or about October 2006, R. Singh quit his job in Dubai in order to attend his \ninterview at the United States Consulate. \n 109 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 113 of 158\n497.  Just before R. Singhโs flight to the United States, Dewan forced him to sign \nseveral papers in English, which R. Singh does not speak or read.  Dewan and his employee \nassured him that the papers were related to legal work.  Dewan refused to explain to R. Singh \nwhat he was signing.  R. Singh only received his passport back after he signed this paperwork. \n498.  R. Singh was appalled by the horrible conditions at Signal.  Nonetheless, he knew \nthat he would not be able to repay the money he had borrowed if he returned to India.  He felt \nthat he had no choice but to stay at Signal and wait to receive the green card that Signal and its \nAgents continued to promise.  In particular, in or about July 2007, Signal officials and Burnett \nled a meeting at which they told the workers that they would apply for the workersโ visa \nextensions and green cards. \n499.  R. Singh relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, R. \nSingh felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nSavinder Singh \n500.  In or about April or May of 2006, S. Singh was working in the UAE when he saw \nan advertisement promising the opportunity to work in the United States and obtain a green card.  \nS. Singh called Dewan Consultants and spoke with someone who invited him to attend a meeting \nat Dewan Consultantsโ office. \n 110 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 114 of 158\n501.  In or about May of 2006, S. Singh traveled to Dewan Consultantsโ UAE office \nand spoke with Dewanโs sister, who told him that Signal workers would travel to the United \nStates on a green card and that Dewan Consultants would help him obtain permanent residency.   \n502.  On or about May 25, 2006, S. Singh took and passed a welding test at which \nDewan, Pol, and a Signal employee were present.  A few days later, S. Singh met with Dewan at \nhis UAE office.  Dewan told S. Singh that he would receive a green card after arriving in the \nUnited States. \n503.  At the May 2006 meeting, Dewan told S. Singh that the visa and green card \nprocess would cost approximately $11,250.  However, Dewan, Pol, and Burnett ultimately \ndemanded approximately $14,250.  S. Singh paid this amount in installments.  To obtain the \nmoney, S. Singh borrowed money from friends, gave the title to his home as collateral to obtain a \nlarge loan, and depleted his life savings. \n504.  In or about October 2006, S. Singh met with Dewan and Burnett, who told him to \ntell U.S. consular officials that he was only traveling to the United States on a temporary basis.  \nDuring this conversation, Dewan again assured S. Singh that he would receive a green card if he \nfollowed their instructions. \n505.  On or about October 30, 3006, S. Singh traveled to Dewanโs office in Mumbai to \ncollect his ticket and passport.  Dewan demanded that S. Singh sign several documents written in \nEnglish, which S. Singh could not read.  Dewan also demanded that S. Singh give him the \npaperwork regarding his โrecruitment fees.โ  When S. Singh resisted, Dewan told him that he \nwould lose the money that he had paid and his passport if he did not comply.  Because he had \nincurred so much debt, S. Singh felt that he had no choice but to comply.  Only after S. Singh \nrelinquished his paperwork, signed the documents, and gave his final payment to Dewan did \n 111 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 115 of 158\nDewan give S. Singh his passport.  Dewan assured him that Malvern Burnett would process S. \nSinghโs green card. \n506.  After his arrival in Mississippi, S. Singh repeatedly inquired about his green card.  \nApproximately every two weeks until he left Signal on or about December 17, 2008, S. Singh \nmet with Signal employees, including John Sanders, who told him that if he listened to Signalโs \ninstructions, he would receive a green card.  In addition, on or about March 8, 2007, S. Singh \nattended a meeting at which Signalโs Vice President, Snyder, and Burnett told S. Singh that they \nwould process his green card application.  Approximately two months later, S. Singh complied \nwith a notice that Signal had posted at the man camp stating that workers should submit copies \nof their I-94 forms and passports for green card processing.  \n507.  S. Singh felt compelled to remain at Signal in order to recoup the money he had \npaid in โrecruitment fees.โ  In addition, S. Singh felt compelled to live at man camp because \nSignal would deduct approximately $245 each week for room and board regardless of whether he \nlived at the man camp.  S. Singh was also afraid that if he complained, he would lose his job and \nbe sent back to India.  In or about March of 2007, Dewan traveled to the man camp and \ninstructed S. Singh not to complain about the conditions at Signal.  Around the same time, S. \nSingh learned that Dewan had threatened another workerโs family in India.  S. Singh feared that \nhe and his family might be hurt if he complained about the conditions at Signal or did not follow \nSignalโs instructions.  Signal employees also threatened to deport him if he caused problems.  S. \nSingh had no friends or family in the United States and felt that he had no choice but to endure \nthe conditions at Signal if he wanted to repay his debts. \n508.  Signalโs assurances that S. Singh would receive a green card continued into 2008.  \nIn or about March of 2008, Snyder and Signal attorney Patricia Bollman assured S. Singh that \n 112 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 116 of 158\nSignal was processing S. Singhโs green card extension and that he would receive an H-2B visa \nextension.  In or about November 2008, Signal representatives told S. Singh that if he helped \nSignal by signing an affidavit supporting the company, Signal would complete the paperwork \nnecessary for S. Singh to obtain a green card.  Signalโs translator, Ramesh Gunisetti, told S. \nSingh that the document stated that S. Singh had not paid any money to Pol, Burnett, or Dewan \nto obtain his immigration paperwork.  S. Singh could not read English sufficiently to understand \nthe affidavit, but he felt compelled to sign because he feared that if he did not, he would be \ndeported and would not be able to repay his debts.  S. Singh later learned that this affidavit stated \nthat he was very happy working at Signal and that he could read, write and speak English. \n509.  S. Singh relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, S. \nSingh felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nShanmugam Subramanian \n510.  In or about 2006, Subramanian was working as a pipefitter in Singapore when a \nfriend in India sent him a newspaper advertisement offering jobs in the United States.  It stated \nthat workers would travel to the United States on H-2B visas and would then receive green cards.  \nSubramanian quit his job in Singapore and traveled to India to respond to the advertisement.  He \narrived in India in or about April 2006. \n511.  In India, Subramanian attended a meeting where he met Salimon and filled out an \napplication.  He later met Pol, Dewan, and Salimon for an interview.  After the interview, \n 113 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 117 of 158\nSalimon assured Subramanian that if he was selected and accepted the job, Signal would apply \nfor his green card once he arrived in the United States.  Salimon soon called Subramanian to tell \nhim he had been selected for the job. \n512.  Soon thereafter, Subramanian met with Salimon, who gave him a document \nstating that Subramanian would need to pay Dewan, Pol, and Burnett a series of payments \ntotaling over 600,000 rupees (approximately $13,200). \n513.  Subramanian paid all the fees demanded by the Agents.  In order to pay these \nfees, Subramanian used the money he had saved from his job in Singapore and pledged his \nmotherโs and sisterโs jewelry as collateral in exchange for a loan of 350,000 rupees \n(approximately $7,700) at 5 percent monthly interest.  Subramanian also turned down a job \nopportunity in Canada, because he felt obtaining a United States green card would offer him \nbetter work opportunities. \n514.  The day before Subramanian flew to the United States, he travelled to Dewanโs \noffice in Mumbai to make his final payment.  However, Dewan told him that he still owed \napproximately 10,000 to 15,000 rupees.  Dewan informed Subramanian that if he did not pay this \namount immediately, he would not receive his visa, passport, or plane ticket.  Dewan also \ninformed him that he would not receive a refund for the money he had already paid.  \nSubramanian called a friend in Mumbai, who was able to raise the missing amount.  Only then \ndid Dewan allow Subramanian to fly to the United States. \n515.  When he arrived at Signal, Subramanian was appalled at the squalid living \nconditions.  He also learned that approximately $1,050 per month would be deducted from his \nwages, regardless of whether he chose to live at the man camp.  Subramanian felt that he had no \nchoice but to stay with Signal, however, because he needed to repay the substantial debts he had \n 114 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 118 of 158\nincurred in order to take the job.  Subramanian was afraid to complain about the living and \nworking conditions because he knew that Signal fired workers who complained. \n516.  At Signal, Subramanian attended meetings with Signal officials approximately \nonce each month.  At those meetings, Signal officials repeatedly assured Subramanian and other \nIndian workers that Signal would apply for their green cards. \n517.  Subramanian relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, \nSubramanian felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nNinan John Tharakan \n518.  In or about May 2006, Tharakan was working in Dubai when a friend told him \nabout an advertisement offering pipefitting jobs in the United States.  Tharakan called the \nnumber that his friend gave him and spoke with a representative of Dewan Consultants.  The \nrepresentative invited him to an informational meeting at a hotel in Dubai. \n519.  At the meeting, Dewan told Tharakan that those who were hired would work for a \nlarge U.S. company.  They would receive a green card after working for eighteen months.  At \nthat point, they would be able to bring their families to the United States. \n520.  In or about June 2006, Dewan and a Signal employee interviewed Tharakan and \nadministered a written test.  After being notified that he had passed the test, Tharakan again met \nwith Dewan.  Dewan told him that he would travel to the United States on an H-2B visa, which \n 115 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 119 of 158\nwould be extended until his green card had been processed.  Dewan said that Signal would take \ncare of the immigration paperwork.   \n521.  During this meeting and later meetings in or about June and July 2006, Dewan \nand his employees told Tharakan that he must pay 700,000 rupees (approximately $15,344) to \nDewan, Pol, and Burnett for visa and green card processing. \n522.  Tharakan raised the money to pay the fees by selling his and his wifeโs wedding \nrings.  He used the remainder of his wifeโs jewelry as collateral for a loan at 13 percent interest, \nand took out another loan at 21 percent interest.  Tharakan also used money that he had \npreviously borrowed to buy property in India.  Tharakan paid the first three installments of his \nfees in or about June and July 2006.   \n523.  In or about September 2006, Tharakan took emergency leave from his job in \nDubai to attend his H-2B visa interview at the United States Consulate in India.  Because \nTharakan had to wait almost two months for an interview date, his employer fired him. \n524.  On the day of his flight to the United States, Tharakan traveled to Dewanโs office, \nwhere he paid his final installment.  Dewan refused to give Tharakan his passport and ticket until \nhe had paid his fees, given Dewan his receipts, and signed two or three blank pieces of paper. \n525.  Upon arrival in the United States, Tharakan was shocked by the living conditions \nat Signalโs Mississippi facility.  He was also surprised to learn that Signal would deduct $35 per \nday from his paycheck, even if he chose to live outside of the man camp.  Nonetheless, Tharakan \ndid not feel that he could complain or leave his job due to his debt, Signalโs threats of \ndeportation, and his fears that Dewan might hurt his family.  In or about March 2007, a Dewan \nConsultants employee called Tharakanโs family and told them that if Tharakan created any \nproblems at Signal, his family would encounter problems in India. \n 116 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 120 of 158\n526.  Moreover, in or about March 2007, Signal officials and Burnett told the workers \nduring a camp meeting that Signal would extend their visas and file their green card applications.  \nTharakan believed these promises and wanted to remain in the companyโs good favor so he \nwould receive his green card.   \n527.  Tharakan relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, \nTharakan felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nKittayi Sunil Kumar Therattil \n528.  In or about July of 2006, Therattil saw a newspaper advertisement that offered the \nopportunity to work in the United States and obtain a green card. \n529.  The next day, Therattil traveled to the Dewan Consultants address listed on the \nadvertisement.  He met with Salimon, Dewan, and two Signal representatives.  Salimon told \nTherattil that he would get a good job at Signal and could bring his family to the United States \nafter approximately eight months.  The Signal employees asked Therattil about his work \nexperiences and administered a written test, which they told Therattil that he had passed.  The \nSignal employees also told Therattil to speak with Dewan and Salimon to learn more about the \ndetails, including the cost, of the opportunity to travel to the United States.   \n530.  Dewan and Salimon told Therattil that he would travel to the United States on an \nH-2B visa and would receive a green card after nine to twelve months, at which point he could \nbring his family to the United States.  Dewan and Salimon also asked Therattil to fill out \n 117 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 121 of 158\npaperwork with information about his family.  They told Therattil that Signal would need this \ninformation to process his familyโs immigration paperwork.  Therattil only agreed to pursue the \nopportunity at Signal because Dewan and Salimon promised him that he could bring his family \nto the United States. \n531.  Dewan told Therattil that this opportunity would cost 600,000 rupees \n(approximately $13,650), which Therattil paid in installments to Dewan, Pol, and Burnett.  \nTherattil also paid additional visa and medical fees.  To obtain this money, Therattil used his \nwifeโs wedding jewelry as collateral to obtain a loan at a 9.5 percent annual interest rate.  He also \nobtained additional loans with monthly interest rates of approximately 1.75 percent by using both \nhis and his father-in-lawโs houses and land as collateral.  The 1.75 percent monthly interest rate \nwould double if Therattil missed one payment. \n532.  In or about August of 2006, Therattil traveled to Dewanโs office to make \npayments to Pol and Burnett.  Dewan assured Therattil that he would be able to live comfortably \nin America and that everything would proceed as Dewan had promised. \n533.  The next day, Therattil attended a large meeting, which was run by Dewan, \nSalimon, and an American.  Dewan explained that Therattil and other workers should tell the \nU.S. consulate that they were traveling to the United States on temporary H-2B visas and would \nreturn to India after six to nine months.  Dewan assured Therattil and the other workers this was \npart of the process, and they had nothing to worry about. \n534.  In or about December of 2006, Therattil traveled to Dewan Consultantsโ office in \nMumbai to make his final payment to Dewan.  Just before Therattil left for the airport, Dewan \ndemanded that he sign documents written in English.  Therattil did not know what was written in \nthe papers because he could not read English well, and Dewan refused to read the papers to \n 118 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 122 of 158\nTherattil.  Dewanโs staff demanded that Therattil sign the papers quickly, so he signed them.  \nOnly after Therattil made his final payment to Dewan and signed the papers did Dewan give \nTherattil his passport. \n535.  After his arrival in the United States, Therattil felt compelled to remain at Signal \nbecause of the substantial debt he had incurred.  Signal employees told him that if he left the \ncompany, he could not return to Signal or to the United States.  Therattil feared that if he left \nSignal or did not complete his work perfectly, he would be deported and would be unable to \nrepay his debt. \n536.  Therattil also felt compelled to remain at the man camp so that he could receive \nthe green card that he had been promised.  In particular, during a meeting shortly after Therattil \narrived at Signal, he told Signal employees about the substantial amount of money he had paid \nand asked when he would receive his green card.  Burnett, who was present at the meeting, told \nTherattil and other workers that they should wait, and Signal would take care of their \nimmigration paperwork. \n537.  Therattil later spoke with other Signal officials about the money he had paid to \nwork for Signal.  Signal officials repeatedly assured Therattil that they would renew his H-2B \nvisa, and a Signal employee told him that if he worked hard, Signal would take care of his green \ncard and permanent residency. \n538.  In or about early 2007, Dewan traveled to the man camp.  Therattil and other \nworkers asked Dewan about their permanent residency status.  They also requested refunds \nbecause of the deplorable conditions at Signal.  Dewan told them to continue working. \n539.  Signal deducted $35 each day from Therattilโs wages for room and board. \n 119 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 123 of 158\n540.  Therattil relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, \nTherattil felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nMoni Panikulangara Thomas \n541.  In or about May of 2006, Thomas saw a newspaper advertisement posted by \nDewan Consultants, offering welders and fitters jobs for in the United States, H-2B visas, and \ngreen cards.   \n542.  In or about May 2006, Thomas attended a meeting where Dewan, Salimon, and an \nAmerican introduced as Signalโs attorney were present.  At this meeting, Dewan explained that \nSignal needed workers to repair oil rigs.  Signal was offering workers an H-2B visa and a green \ncard, as well as accommodations, transportation, a salary of $18 dollars per hour, and benefits.  \nSalimon told the attendees that they must pass a practical skills test, which would cost 2,500 \nrupees (approximately $554).  Thomas did not want to pay the money for the skills test, so he left \nthe meeting. \n543.  Approximately three days after the meeting, Salimon called Thomas and \nencouraged him to take the skills test, telling him that he would not need to pay a fee for the test.  \nThomas traveled to Cochin to take the skills test, which he passed.  Salimon, Dewan, and two \nSignal employees were present.  Dewan stated that the green card program was based upon the \nworkers obtaining an H-2B visa.  Thomas told Dewan that he only wanted a green card, but \nDewan replied that green cards were only available to those who accepted the H-2B option first. \n 120 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 124 of 158\n544.  Dewan also informed Thomas that it would cost 200,000 rupees (approximately \n$4,430) in fees to obtain the H-2B visa, and an additional 400,000 rupees (approximately $8,860) \nin fees to obtain the green card.  Thomas paid the combined 600,000 rupees to Defendants in \ninstallments.  To obtain this money, Thomas depleted his life savings, including money he and \nhis wife had earned working abroad that he had planned to use to build a house for his family.  \nHe also borrowed money from his brother.  \n545.  In or about July 2006, Salimon called Thomas and told him to travel to a hotel in \nCochin on August 5, 2006 to pay the first installment.  On approximately August 5, 2006, \nThomas traveled to the Trident Hotel in Cochin, where Dewan, Salimon, and Burnett were \npresent.  Thomas made payments to Defendants.  He also filled out immigration forms, which \nDewan said would be used for processing applications for his H-2B visa and green card. \n546.  Around the beginning of November 2006, Thomas met with Salimon, Burnett, \nand Dewan at a hotel in Chennai to prepare for his interview at the U.S. consulate.  Dewan told \nThomas that he would be interviewed about his H-2B visa application.  Dewan instructed \nThomas to tell the interviewer that he would return to India before the visa expired.  Nonetheless, \nDewan reassured Thomas that the H-2B visa would convert into a green card.  Salimon, Burnett, \nand Dewan also asked Thomas to sign additional paperwork. \n547.  A few days after meeting with Salimon, Burnett, and Dewan, Thomas returned to \nChennai for his interview with the consulate.  Thomas met with Dewan and Salimon before the \ninterview, and Dewan reminded Thomas that, during the interview, he should say that he planned \nto return to India when the visa expired. \n548.  A few weeks after the consulate interview, Salimon called Thomas to remind him \nto pay his outstanding payments.  After this conversation, Thomas called Dewan several times to \n 121 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 125 of 158\nask about his passport; Dewan responded that Thomas would receive his passport once he \narrived in Mumbai and made his final payment. \n549.  On or about November 23, 2006, Thomas traveled to Dewanโs office in Mumbai \nto make his final payment and collect his passport.  Thomas expressed concern to Dewan and \ntold him that he needed the green card to be processed quickly.  Dewan told Thomas to be brave \nand that there would be no trouble.  Before giving Thomas his passport, Dewan demanded that \nThomas sign various documents that were written in English, without offering him enough time \nto review them.  Thomas felt compelled to sign the documents so that he would receive his \npassport. \n550.  After arriving in the United States, Thomas requested several times to change his \nliving accommodations.  Signal officials told him that Signal would continue to deduct the cost \nof room and board from his paycheck even if he lived elsewhere.  Thomas felt he had no option \nbut to continue to live at Signalโs camp because he could not afford to repay his debts in India if \nhe paid Signalโs room and board fees in addition to paying rent to live outside the camp. \n551.  While working at Signal, Thomas began to feel ill, and eventually traveled to a \nclinic in Dorchester, Mississippi.  At the clinic, the attending doctor took an echocardiogram, \nwhich revealed that Thomasโs heart was enlarged.  Thomas then saw a cardiologist.  Two to \nthree days after seeing the cardiologist, Thomas had severe burning in his chest, pain in his left \narm, and a high fever.   A doctor diagnosed Thomas with acute pericarditis (bacterial infection of \nthe heart).  Due to this sickness, Thomas was unable to work at Signal for over one month and \ndid not receive a salary during that time.  Upon returning to work, Signal cut Thomasโs entire \nsalary to compensate for the lost room and board payments for the entire time Thomas was \nunable to work, until that amount was fully paid. \n 122 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 126 of 158\n552.  In approximately May 2007, Thomas still had severe chest pain and was taking \nmedications.  Worried that he was not receiving adequate treatment in the United States, Thomas \nasked Signal if he could travel to India for treatment.  He was reluctant to put his job in jeopardy, \nbut Signal gave him permission, specifying that Thomas could keep his job if he returned by a \ncertain date.  After receiving treatment in India, Thomas returned to Signal.  He felt he had no \nchoice but to return to Signal because he needed to repay his debts.  In addition, Signal continued \nto promise that he would receive visa extensions, a green card, and the opportunity to settle \npermanently in the United States with his family.  \n553.  Thomas relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, Thomas \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue to work for Signal.    \nThenooran Kumaran Unnikrishnan \n554.  In or about June of 2006, Unnikrishnan was working in Dubai when he saw a \nnewspaper advertisement promising the opportunity to work in the United States and to obtain a \ngreen card.  Unnikrishnan called the phone number listed on the advertisement and spoke with \nDewanโs receptionist, who instructed Unnikrishnan to attend a meeting in Dubai. \n555.  At the meeting, Unnikrishnan was interviewed by a Signal employee.  \nUnnikrishnan later completed and passed a skills test.  A Dewan Consultants employee then told \nUnnikrishnan that he must pay Dewan approximately 25,000 rupees (approximately $550).  \nUnnikrishnan borrowed money from co-workers in order to pay this fee.  Before paying the fee, \n 123 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 127 of 158\nUnnikrishnan asked a Dewan Consultants receptionist and another employee whether he would \nreceive a refund if his visa application for travel to the United States was unsuccessful.  They \ntold Unnikrishnan that Dewan Consultants would keep 500 dirhams (the currency of the United \nArab Emirates, approximately $135, or 6,250 rupees), but would return the remainder to \nUnnikrishnan.  Unnikrishnan then paid the fee.  \n556.  After Unnikrishnan paid the fee, Burnett refused to meet with Unnikrishnan had \npaid him an additional installment of the โrecruitment fees.โ   \n557.  On or about August 22, 2006, Unnikrishnan met with Burnett, Dewan, and \nDewanโs brother in Dubai.  Dewan told Unnikrishnan and that he would travel to the United \nStates on an H-2B visa and that Signal would process his green card once he was in the United \nStates.  He would then receive permanent residency.  \n558.  While Unnikrishnan was in Dewanโs office, he learned that a fax arrived stating \nthat 250 H-2B visas had been approved.  Dewan told Unnikrishnan that the first people to pay \nwould be able to travel to the United States on one of those visas. \n559.  At that meeting, Unnikrishnan signed three agreements with Burnett, Pol, and \nDewan.  The agreements stated that Unnikrishnan would receive a green card and that this \nprocess would cost 700,000 rupees (approximately $15,400).   \n560.  Unnikrishnan paid this amount in installments to Dewan, Burnett, and Pol.  To \nraise the money, Unnikrishnan mortgaged his home at approximately 11 percent monthly interest \nand took out a second mortgage at approximately 2.6 percent monthly interest.  Unnikrishnan \nalso borrowed money from his uncle, who obtained the money by mortgaging his own home at \napproximately 1 percent monthly interest. \n 124 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 128 of 158\n561.  On or about October 4, 2006, Unnikrishnan quit his job in Dubai and traveled to \nIndia to meet with Burnett, Dewan, and Salimon in preparation for his interview at the U.S. \nconsulate.  At the meeting, Burnett told Unnikrishnan that he should not tell anyone that he had \nbeen promised a green card.  Because Unnikrishnan had already paid over 200,000 rupees \n(approximately $4,400), he felt that he had no choice but to comply with Burnettโs instructions. \nAfter his consular interview, Salimon told Unnikrishnan that he would not receive his passport \nuntil he paid all of his โrecruitment fees.โ \n562.  On or about November 28, 2006, the day he was scheduled to fly to the United \nStates, Unnikrishnan traveled to the Dewanโs office in Mumbai to pay his final fee installment \nand obtain his passport.  At the office, he saw Dewan shouting at other recruits, telling them that \nhe would not to give them their passports if they did not pay.  This frightened Unnikrishnan. \n563.  When Unnikrishnan met with Dewan, Dewan demanded that Unnikrishnan \nquickly sign paperwork written in English.  Unnikrishnan did not have enough time to read it, \nbut Dewan told him that the paperwork was for green card processing.  Unnikrishnan felt \ncompelled to sign the paperwork quickly, give Dewan all the documents that he demanded, and \npay Dewan so he would not miss his flight. \n564.  Before Unnikrishnan left Dewanโs office, Dewan informed him for the first time \nthat Signal would deduct approximately $35 per day for room and board.  Dewan also told him \nthat he would travel to the United States on an H-2B visa, and Signal would not process his \ngreen card until eight months after Unnikrishnan arrived in the United States.  Unnikrishnan was \ndevastated, but felt he had no choice but to continue to the United States because Dewan, for the \nfirst time, told Unnikrishnan that he could not receive a refund for the fees he had paid. \n 125 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 129 of 158\n565.  Upon arriving in Mississippi, Unnikrishnan filled out and signed several \ndocuments.  He did not know what he was signing because the Signal employees told him to sign \nthe documents immediately.  During his first week, Unnikrishnan also attended meetings at \nwhich Signal employees stated that Signal would apply for the workersโ green cards, but that if \nthe workers did not follow Signalโs rules, they would be terminated without warning.  In \naddition, in or about February of 2007, Signal posted a notice stating that Unnikrishnan and other \nworkers should submit copies of their immigration forms and passports to John Sanders for green \ncard processing.  Even after the incident in March 2007 when a number of workers were \ndeported, John Sanders again assured Unnikrishnan that his green card would be processed \neasily, and Dewan told him that Signal would arrange everything for him.  Unnikrishnan \nremained at Signal due to his heavy debts and Signalโs repeated promises that he would receive a \ngreen card. In or about July of 2007, Malvern Burnett told Unnikrishnan that his visa extension \nwas being processed and would soon be granted. \n566.  Unnikrishnan relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, \nUnnikrishnan felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nBenny Chittilappilly Vareed \n567.  In or about May of 2006, Vareed saw a newspaper advertisement placed by \nDewan Consultants.  The advertisement offered the opportunity to work in the United States as a \nwelder or fitter and to obtain a green card. \n 126 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 130 of 158\n568.  In or about mid-May of 2006, Vareed attended a meeting led by Dewan, Burnett, \nand Salimon.  Burnett explained that Vareed could travel to the United States on an H-2B visa \nand work for Signal.  The H-2B visa would later be converted to a green card. \n569.  Dewan explained that this process would cost 800,000 rupees (approximately \n$17,720); Vareedโs H-2B visa would cost 300,000 rupees (approximately $6645) and his green \ncard would cost 500,000 rupees (approximately $11,075).  However, Salimon later called Vareed \nand said that he could pay a total of 600,000 rupees (approximately $13,290).  Vareed paid this \namount in installments to Defendants.  To obtain the money for his โrecruitment fees,โ Vareed \nborrowed money from his wifeโs family and sold his wifeโs wedding jewelry. \n570.  Vareed also took a welding test, which he passed.  The test was administered by \nDewan, Salimon, and two or three Signal employees. \n571.  In or about August of 2006, Vareed met with Dewan, Salimon, and Burnett at a \nhotel in India, where Vareed made a payment to Defendants.  Dewan, Salimon, and Burnett \nrequired Vareed to sign several forms written in English, which Vareed could not read well.  \nVareed signed and completed forms based on Salimonโs instructions. \n572.  In or about the fall of 2006, Vareed met with Dewan, Salimon, and Burnett to \nprepare for his interview with the U.S. consulate.  Dewan told Vareed that he should not inform \nthe consulate that he would receive a green card and, if he did so, Vareedโs visa would not be \napproved.  Vareed felt compelled to follow Dewanโs instructions because he had already \nincurred significant debt to pay Defendants. \n573.  On or about November 19, 2006, Vareed traveled to Mumbai to make his final \npayment to Dewan and retrieve his passport.  Dewanโs brother and other Dewan Consultants \nemployees immediately demanded that Vareed sign paperwork written in English.  Vareed did \n 127 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 131 of 158\nnot know what the paperwork said, but felt compelled to sign because he had to leave for the \nairport almost immediately.  Vareed also made his final payment to Dewan.  Only after Vareed \nmade this payment did Dewan give him his passport.  Vareed then hurried to the airport and flew \nto the United States. \n574.  Upon arrival in the United States, Signal reduced Vareedโs wages from $19 to \n$17.50 per hour.  Vareed pleaded with his foreman for Signal to increase his wages.  The \nforeman agreed to increase Vareedโs wages if he worked hard.  Because he had incurred \nsubstantial debt to travel to the United States, Vareed felt compelled to agree to the wage \nreduction. \n575.  Signal also deducted $35 per day from Vareedโs paycheck for room and board.  \nVareed asked John Sanders if he could live outside the man camp, but Sanders informed him that \nSignal would deduct this room and board fee even if Vareed lived elsewhere.  Vareed felt \nfinancially compelled to remain at the man camp to repay his debt.  Vareed also felt compelled to \nendure the deplorable conditions at Signal because his H-2B visa did not allow him to work for \nany other employer in the United States. \n576.  Vareed attended several meetings led by Signal officials.  At many meetings, \nVareed and other employees informed Signal officials that they had incurred substantial debt to \nwork for Signal.  They also asked about the status of their green cards.  In response, John \nSanders informed Vareed and other workers that Signal would only give green cards to workers \nwho did good work according to Signalโs standards.  Vareed felt that he had no choice but to \nobey all of Signalโs demands if he wanted to obtain the green card he had been promised. \n577.  After the March 9, 2007 incident discussed above, Vareed feared that, if he \ncomplained, Signal would retaliate against him and arrange for his deportation.  Vareed knew \n 128 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 132 of 158\nthat if he were deported, he would then be unable to repay his debt.  Consequently, Vareed felt \nthat he could not voice his concerns about the conditions at the man camp. \n578.  Shortly thereafter, Vareed attended a meeting at the man camp led by Dewan and \nBurnett.  Both Dewan and Burnett promised Vareed and other employees that their green card \nprocessing would continue as promised.  In or about July of 2007, a Signal manager and Darrell \nSnyder assured Vareed and other Signal employees that their visa would be extended.  Based on \nthese promises, Vareed continued to work at Signal. \n579.  In or about May of 2007, Vareed returned to India after his young son became \nseriously ill.  He was reluctant to put his job in jeopardy, but Signal gave him permission, \nspecifying that Thomas could keep his job if he returned by a certain date.  After just 14 days, \nVareed returned to Signal.  He felt he had no choice but to return to Signal because he needed to \nrepay his debts.  In addition, Signal had continued to promise that he would receive visa \nextensions and a green card. \n580.  Vareed relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, \nVareed felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nGeorge Pulikkeparambil Varghese \n581.  In or about November and December 2003, Vargheseโs sister-in-lawโs father told \nVargheseโs son about an opportunity to work in the United States as a welder.  Vargheseโs sister-\n 129 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 133 of 158\nin-law told Vargheseโs son that there would be a meeting to learn more about the opportunity.  \nVargheseโs son attended the meeting. \n582.  Soon thereafter, Varghese met with Dewan and Salimon.  Dewan told Varghese \nthat his son could work in America as a welder.  He explained that this process would cost at \nleast 500,000 rupees (approximately $10,700).   \n583.  Varghese and his son paid these fees to Dewan, Pol, and Burnett.  To make these \npayments, Varghese sold some gold jewelry owned by the family.  He also mortgaged his home \nto borrow a large amount of money from a bank at an interest rate of approximately 17.9 percent.  \nVarghese and his son made their final payments to Dewan and Salimon in or about August 2004. \n584.  For approximately two years after he made his final payment, Vargheseโs son \nremained in India but heard nothing from Defendants.  Vargheseโs son repeatedly called \nSalimon, who assured him that he would be able to go to the United States soon. \n585.  In or about June 2006, Varghese and his son learned from friends that Dewan \nConsultants was still interviewing people.  Then in or about August 2006, Varghese saw a \nnewspaper advertisement in which Dewan Consultants offered opportunities for pipefitters and \nwelders to work in the United States.  Vargheseโs son called Dewan Consultants and spoke with \nSalimon.  Salimon explained that Dewan Consultants was conducting interviews for people to \nwork for Signal and travel to the United States on an H-2B visa.  Salimon said that Varghese and \nhis son should attend a meeting on or about September 8, 2006. \n586.  At this meeting, Dewan and Salimon explained that they were looking for people \nto travel to the United States on H-2B visas, which would be extended while their green cards \nwere processed.  Vargheseโs son decided to travel to the United States and work at Signal, but he \n 130 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 134 of 158\nfailed his visa interview and could not go.  Salimon told Varghese that Varghese could work at \nSignal instead. \n587.  Varghese completed his interview process and gave Dewan Consultants his \npassport for visa processing.  Salimon then told Varghese that he would have to pay an \nadditional 278,000 rupees (approximately $6,308) in cash within one day.  Varghese paid this \nfee.  In order to raise the money, he borrowed some money from his brother and sisters, and used \nhis savings to finance the remainder. \n588.  On the day of his flight to the United States, Varghese traveled to Dewanโs office \nin Mumbai.  A large number of people were waiting in Dewanโs office, and Varghese had to wait \nalmost the entire day before anyone at the office met with him.  When Dewanโs brother finally \nmet with Varghese, he told Varghese that he had to sign a document written in English before he \ncould receive his plane ticket.  Because Varghese needed to leave for the airport immediately, he \ndid not have enough time to read the document.  He signed quickly and left the office. \n589.  After he arrived at Signal, Varghese worked for approximately two weeks.  Signal \nemployees then told him that there was not enough work for him, and they would let him know \nwhen he could work again.  Varghese did not work for two weeks.  Then, Darrell Snyder told \nhim that he could work, but only for $9 per hour.  Snyder said that if Varghese refused, he would \nhave to go back to India.  Afraid of being sent back to India, where he would not be able to repay \nhis debts, Varghese felt that he had no choice but to work for the lower wage. \n590.  Varghese relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \n 131 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 135 of 158\nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, \nVarghese felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nEstate of Kuliyanickal Paily Varghese \n591.  In or about early June of 2006, K. Varghese saw a newspaper advertisement \nposted by Dewan Consultants.  The advertisement offered the opportunity to work as a welder \nand obtain permanent residency in the United States.  The advertisement specified that applicants \nshould take a welding test in late June of 2006.   \n592.  On the day of the test, K. Varghese traveled to the testing facility in Kochi.  \nBefore K. Varghese took the test, Dewan and Salimon explained that the cost of employment and \nobtaining a green card would be 700,000 rupees (approximately $15,217).  Dewan also explained \nthat applicants who passed the welding test would travel to the United States on H-2B visas, but \ntheir green card applications would be processed within six months, and they would then be able \nto bring their families to the United States.  A Signal employee administered K. Vargheseโs \nwelding test and told him that he had passed. \n593.  Approximately one week after the test, K. Varghese traveled to Salimonโs office \nin Kerala to pay his first installment.  He also signed several forms, which he believed were \nrelated to his visa and permanent residency application. \n594.  Approximately two weeks after he visited Salimonโs office, K. Varghese received \na letter from Dewan that explained that K. Varghese would pay Burnett, Pol, Dewan, and \nSalimon in installments.  The letter also explained that K. Vargheseโs payments would go \ntowards his employment and permanent residency in the United States.  To obtain the 700,000 \nrupees that he paid Defendants, K. Varghese sold his wifeโs gold and jewelry.  He also took out a \nloan for 550,000 rupees (approximately $11,957) at a 13.5 percent interest rate. \n 132 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 136 of 158\n595.   About two weeks after receiving this letter, K. Varghese traveled to Salimonโs \noffice to make a payment to Defendants.  Dewan, Salimon, and Burnett were present.  Salimon \nexplained that Burnett would process K. Vargheseโs paperwork.  Salimon also promised K. \nVarghese that he would receive employment and a green card in the United States.  Dewan, \nSalimon, and Burnett made similar promises throughout K. Vargheseโs application process. \n596.  In or about October of 2006, K. Varghese traveled to Chennai to meet with \nSalimon, Dewan, and Burnett and to prepare for his interview with the U.S. consulate.  Salimon \ntold K. Varghese that he should tell the consulate that he only intended to stay in the United \nStates temporarily.  Burnett, Dewan, and Salimon nonetheless emphasized that even though K. \nVarghese was seeking an H-2B visa from the consulate, he would receive a green card \napproximately one year after arriving in the United States, and his family would also obtain \npermanent residency.  Based on these assurances, K. Varghese continued with the application \nprocess. \n597.  On or about November 27, 2006, K. Varghese traveled to Dewanโs office to make \nhis final payment and retrieve his passport.  Dewan demanded that K. Varghese quickly sign \npaperwork without reading it.  Dewan also demanded that K. Varghese return all of his receipts \nand the letters that Dewan had sent him.  K. Varghese felt compelled to comply because he had \nalready paid Dewan so much money and did not want Dewan to prevent him from traveling to \nthe United States.  Only after K. Varghese returned the paperwork and paid Dewan did Dewan \ngive K. Varghese his plane ticket and passport.  K. Varghese then immediately left for the \nairport, where he boarded his flight to the United States. \n598.  Upon arrival in the United States, K. Varghese learned that Signal would deduct \n$245 from each of his paychecks for room and board.  K. Varghese told Signal officials that he \n 133 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 137 of 158\nwanted to live outside the man camp, but they forbade him from doing so.  Afterward, workers \ntold K. Varghese that even though he could leave, Signal would continue to deduct $245 each \nweek.  Because Signal would charge him for room and board regardless of where he lived, K. \nVarghese felt that he had no option but to remain at the man camp. \n599.  While at Signal, K. Varghese attended several meetings in which Burnett and \nSignal employees assured him that they would seek visa extensions for him.  K. Varghese \nremained at Signal so that he could receive the green card he had been promised and repay his \nsubstantial debts. \n600.  Signal officials also repeatedly threatened to have K. Varghese deported if he did \nnot obey all of Signalโs rules.  Therefore, he felt compelled to remain at the man camp, fearing \nthat Signal would have him deported if he left. \n601.  K. Varghese relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, K. \nVarghese felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \n602.  On or about November 26, 2012, K. Varghese died in a car accident.  K. \nVargheseโs claims against Defendants survive his death and are brought on behalf of his estate. \nBenny Kattukariyil Varkey \n603.  In or about February 2006, Varkeyโs co-worker told him about an opportunity \nfrom Dewan Consultants to work as a welder in the United States and obtain a green card.  \n 134 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 138 of 158\nVarkey called Dewan Consultants and spoke with Salimon, who told him to attend a seminar in \nApril or May. \n604.  In or about March 2006, Varkey called Dewan Consultants again and spoke with \nSalimon, who invited him to come to his office.   Salimon explained that Varkey would travel to \nthe United States on an H-2B visa that would later become a green card.  He said that the total \ncost would be 800,000 rupees (approximately $18,080).  Salimon told Varkey to look for an \nadvertisement giving the details about a meeting at the Hilton Hotel.  That same day, Varkey saw \nthe advertisement for the meeting.  This advertisement also offered the opportunity to obtain an \nH-2B visa and a green card.   \n605.  At the seminar, Salimon, Dewan, and an American whom Dewan explained was a \nlawyer for Signal gave a presentation about the jobs at Signal.  Dewan promised the workers that \nthey would receive green cards.  Similarly, the American lawyer assured them that they would \ntravel to the United States on H-2B visas that would become green cards after nine months.  \nAfter the presentation, Dewan reiterated that the cost for the green card would be 800,000 rupees \n(approximately $18,080).  These fees would be paid to Dewan, Pol, and Burnett. \n606.  In or about June 2006, Varkey took a skills test administered by a Signal \nemployee.  Salimon and Dewan were also present.  The Signal representative informed Varkey \nthat he passed.   Varkey began to raise the money to pay the Agents their โrecruitment fees.โ \n607.  To raise the money to pay the fees, Varkey depleted the savings that had set aside \nto buy a house for his family.  Varkey also borrowed money from his brother and used his wifeโs \ngold jewelry as collateral to obtain a second loan.  Varkeyโs wife had received this jewelry as a \nwedding gift from her parents, who had spent their life savings to purchase it.  Varkey and his \nbrother mortgaged their properties to obtain additional loans. \n 135 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 139 of 158\n608.  Varkey paid his first payment at Dewanโs office in or about June 2006.  Salimon \ntold Varkey to sign papers written in English, which he did not fully understand.  He told Varkey \nthat the papers were for his green card processing.   \n609.  In or about August 2006, Varkey paid his second fee installment.  Shortly after he \nmade this payment, Salimon called to tell him that the fees had been reduced to 600,000 rupees \n(approximately $12,960). \n610.  Just before Varkey left for the United States, Varkey traveled to Dewanโs office in \nMumbai, where he paid his final installment.  Dewan told Varkey that $3 per hour would be \ndeducted from his paycheck for room and board.  Dewan also informed Varkey that his H-2B \nvisa would have to be extended for an additional nine months before the green card processing \ncould begin.  He said that when Varkeyโs green card had been processed, he would return to \nIndia, after which he could go back to the United States with his family.   \n611.  Dewanโs staff also required Varkey to sign English-language documents and \nreturn all documents relating to the green card opportunity he had been promised.  They refused \nto explain to Varkey what he was signing.  The office was crowded, Varkey felt rushed, and he \nknew that he would not receive a refund if he refused to sign.  Only after Varkey had paid his \nfinal fee installment, signed the English-language documents, and given Dewan the documents \nrelating to green cards did he receive his passport. \n612.  When Varkey arrived at Signal, he signed a number of English-language \ndocuments that he did not understand.  He later learned that Signal would deduct $35 per day \nfrom his paycheck even if he lived outside of the camp.  Varkey felt that he had no choice but to \nlive at the camp because he could not afford to repay his debts if he paid rent on top of his room \n 136 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 140 of 158\nand board payment to Signal.  In addition, Varkey was afraid to leave his job because of his \nsubstantial debts.  He knew that if he returned to India, he would not be able to repay the loans.  \n613.  Varkey also believed that if he left Signal, he would not receive the green card \nthat Signal and its Agents continued to promise him.  In or about late 2006 or early 2007, John \nSanders told Varkey that the green card process was moving forward.  During the same time \nperiod, Varkey also attended a camp meeting at which Burnett said that Signal would process the \nworkersโ green cards. \n614.  Varkey relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, \nVarkey felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nShahi Vijayan \n615.  In or about March or April 2006, Vijayan saw a newspaper advertisement placed \nby Dewan Consultants offering the opportunity to obtain permanent residency in the United \nStates.  Vijayan called Dewan Consultants, and an employee invited him to an informational \nmeeting. \n616.  Dewan, Salimon, Burnett, and two Signal representatives attended the meeting.  \nDewan explained that if workers waited for their green cards before traveling to the United \nStates, they would have to wait eighteen months.  However, if they traveled to the United States \non H-2B visas, they could leave in six months.  Their green cards would be processed between \nthree to six months after the workers arrived in the United States.  Dewan explained that Signal \n 137 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 141 of 158\nwould be responsible for this process.   He said that the total cost would be 800,000 rupees \n(approximately $18,280).   \n617.  Signalโs representatives provided the companyโs website address at the meeting.  \nVijayan reviewed the website and felt that Signal looked reputable.   \n618.  At this time, Vijayan also had an opportunity to work in Australia.  He mentioned \nthis to Dewan, who assured him that working for Signal would guarantee Vijayanโs permanent \nresidency and allow him to bring his family to the United States.  Salimon also assured Vijayan \nthat Signal was an excellent company.  Based on Dewanโs and Salimonโs assurances, Vijayan \nrefused the job in Australia. \n619.  Vijayan paid the fees demanded in approximately four installments.  In order to \nraise the money, he mortgaged his house and land at 12.5 percent interest.  He also sold his \nwifeโs gold jewelry and used her wedding necklace as collateral to obtain another loan at 12.5 \npercent interest.  Vijayan borrowed the remainder of the money from private lenders who \ncharged high interest rates. \n620.  In or about August 2006, Vijayan met with Burnett and made payments to Burnett \nand Pol.  At that meeting, Burnett guaranteed Vijayan that he would receive a green card if he \nworked for Signal. \n621.  Just before Vijayanโs flight to America, he traveled to Dewanโs office in Mumbai.  \nDewanโs employees required him to sign some documents in English, which Vijayan did not \nspeak well.  Vijayan did not fully understand the documents.  Dewanโs employees nonetheless \nrushed Vijayan and refused to give him his passport until he paid his final installment fees and \nsigned the documents.  Vijayan felt intimidated.  He saw people crying because they did not have \n 138 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 142 of 158\nenough money to make their final payment and Dewan had refused to give them their passports.  \nVijayan signed the paperwork. \n622.  When Vijayan arrived in the United States, Signal also required Vijayan to sign \nEnglish-language documents that he did not understand. \n623.  Upon arrival in Pascagoula, Vijayan learned for the first time that the company \nwould deduct $35 from his paycheck each day for room and board, even if he chose not to live at \nthe man camp.  Vijayan felt compelled to live and work at Signal because he was afraid of being \nsent back to India, where he would be unable to repay his debts.  Vijayan also stayed because \nSignal personnel convinced him during conversations that he could receive a green card if he \nremained. \n624.  Vijayan relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, \nVijayan felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nJohn Yohannan  \n625.  In or about May 2006, Yohannan saw a newspaper advertisement that Dewan \nConsultants had placed, offering the opportunity to work in the United States and obtain a green \ncard.  Yohannan called Dewan Consultantsโ local office and scheduled a meeting. \n626.  At that meeting, Yohannan met with Salimon, who told Yohannan that he could \nwork for Signal, obtain a green card after working for one year, and earn a good salary.  Salimon \nalso told Yohannan that Signal was a reputable company. \n 139 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 143 of 158\n627.  Shortly after that meeting, Yohannan took and passed a welding test administered \nby Michael Pol and a Signal employee.  Pol and the Signal employee told Yohannan to contact \nSalimonโs office.  When Yohannan contacted the office, Salimon repeated his earlier promise \nthat Yohannan would receive a green card. \n628.  Yohannan later attended a larger meeting, where Pol, Salimon, and Dewan again \nstated that Signal was a reputable American company and that Yohannan and other workers \ncould obtain a green card and U.S. citizenship.  They told Yohannan that he would earn $18 per \nhour at Signal and receive food and housing.  Pol, Salimon, and Dewan did not mention H-2B \nvisas or any paycheck deductions.  \n629.  In or about August 2006, Yohannan met with Pol, Burnett, Dewan, and Salimon \nbefore his interview with the U.S. consulate.  They emphasized that if the consulate asked \nYohannan anything about the fees he had paid for his recruitment, he should say that he paid \nnothing. \n630.  Yohannan ultimately paid Dewan, Pol, and Burnett approximately 1,150,000 \nrupees (approximately $25,000) for this opportunity.  To pay for these fees, Yohannan used his \nsavings and took out loans at a 12 percent interest rate.  He secured some of these loans by \npledging his wifeโs jewelry as collateral.    \n631.  Before he left India, Yohannan also had an opportunity to work as a welder in \nSaudi Arabia.  Based on Defendantsโ promises, he gave up that opportunity and instead traveled \nto the United States to work for Signal. \n632.  Just before Yohannan flew to the United States, he met with Dewan in his \nMumbai office.  Dewan refused to give Yohannan his passport and airline ticket until Yohannan \npaid the remaining balance of his fees. Dewan demanded that Yohannan quickly sign various \n 140 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 144 of 158\ndocuments, but he rushed Yohannan and did not give him enough time to read them.  Feeling \nrushed and anxious to get to the airport in time for his flight, Yohannan signed the documents. \n633.  In the United States, Yohannan learned that Signal would deduct approximately \n$260 each week from his paycheck for room and board.   \n634.  Yohannan and other Indian workers attended meetings where they asked Sanders \nand other Signal employees when they would receive their green cards.  The Signal employees \ntold them that Signal would apply for their green cards at the appropriate time. \n635.  Yohannan relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendantsโ \nโrecruitment fees,โ his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, \nYohannan felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nTHE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT (โTVPRAโ) OF \n2003 AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \nForced Labor (18 U.S.C. ยง 1589) and Trafficking with Respect to Peonage, Slavery, Involuntary \nServitude, or Forced Labor (18 U.S.C. ยง 1590) \n636.  Each Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n637.  Each Plaintiff brings this claim against all Defendants. \n638.  Each Plaintiff is authorized to bring these civil claims against all Defendants \npursuant to the civil remedies provisions of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1595. \n 141 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 145 of 158\n639.  Defendants Signal, Dewan, Burnett, and Pol attempted to and did subject each \nPlaintiff to forced labor in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589. \n640.  Defendant Signal employed Plaintiffs in dangerous conditions at a guarded and \ngated man camp, and all Defendants falsely assured Plaintiffs that if they continued to work, \nSignal would assist them in applying for and receiving green cards.  Defendants controlled \nPlaintiffsโ housing, food, access to medical care, and other basic needs, and if Plaintiffs did not \ncontinue working for Signal, they would have been cut off from those needs.   \n641.  Furthermore, the substantial โrecruitment feesโ that Defendants coerced Plaintiffs \ninto paying forced Plaintiffs to work at Signal to pay off their substantial debts. \n642.  Defendants knowingly attempted to and did physically restrain and/or threaten \neach Plaintiff with serious harm in order to obtain the labor and services of each Plaintiff in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. ยง1589(1). \n643.  Defendants knowingly attempted to and did obtain the labor and services of each \nPlaintiff using a scheme, plan, or pattern which, in the totality of the circumstances, was intended \nto coerce and did coerce each Plaintiff to believe that he would suffer serious harm if he were to \nleave the employ of Defendant Signal in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589(2). \n644.  Defendantsโ scheme to isolate Plaintiffs, coerce them to live in conditions causing \npsychological harm, and limit their outside contacts, which included unlawful discrimination in \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981, was designed to convince Plaintiffs that they would suffer serious \nharm if they were to leave the employ of Signal. \n645.  Defendants threatened not to extend Plaintiffsโ H-2B visas, not to sponsor \nPlaintiffs for green cards, to deport Plaintiffs, and to send them back to India if they complained \nabout conditions at Signal, and also deceived Plaintiffs about the terms of their immigration \n 142 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 146 of 158\nstatus, each in a manner that constitutes an abuse of the legal process under 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589(3).  \nDefendants retaliated against Plaintiffs when they sought legal advice regarding their rights and \nimmigration status. \n646.  Defendants knowingly recruited, transported, harbored, provided, and/or obtained \nthe Plaintiffs so as to procure their labor and services in violation of laws prohibiting peonage, \ninvoluntary servitude, and forced labor within the meaning of the provisions of 18 U.S.C. ยง \n1590. \n647.  In violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1590, and in addition to the violations of 18 U.S.C. ยง \n1589 set forth above, Defendants knowingly recruited, transported, harbored and/or obtained the \nPlaintiffs for labor or services in furtherance of Defendantsโ violations of the following \nprovisions of Title 18, Chapter 77 of the U.S. Code: \na.  enticing, persuading, or inducing the Plaintiffs to board an airliner and to \ntravel to various locations throughout India and the United States, with the intent that they may \nbe made or held in modern-day slavery, violating 18 U.S.C. ยง 1583; \nb.  knowingly and willfully holding Plaintiffs to involuntary servitude, as \ndefined by the TVPRA, 22 U.S.C. ยง7102(5)(a) and (b), thereby violating 18 U.S.C. ยง 1584; \nc.  removing, confiscating, or possessing Plaintiffsโ and other class membersโ \npassports and other immigration documents in the course of violating, or with the intent to \nviolate 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1583, 1584, 1589, and 1590, thereby violating 18 U.S.C. ยง 1592(a); and \nd.  attempting to violate 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1583, 1584, 1589, and 1590, thereby \nviolating 18 U.S.C. ยง 1594(a). \n648.

As a proximate result of the conduct of Defendants, Plaintiffs have suffered \ninjuries to their persons, businesses, and property, as well as other damages.  Plaintiffs are \nentitled to recover damages for the period up to and including the time that Plaintiffs were \nemployed by Signal.  Those damages include compensatory damages (including, without \nlimitation, loss of wages, loss of opportunity, pain and suffering, mental and emotional distress, \nprejudgment interest, and additional economic loss from (1) recruitment and visa fees paid to \nDefendants; (2) expenses that Plaintiffs incurred to pay such fees, including but not limited to \ninterest from loans; (3) medical expenses; (4) damages related to living and working conditions; \nand (5) mandatory housing and other fees paid to Signal), punitive damages, and attorneysโ fees \nin an amount to be proven at trial. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nVIOLATIONS OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1866 \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1981 BROUGHT AGAINST SIGNAL \n650.  Each Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n651.  Each Plaintiff asserts this claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981 for declaratory \nrelief and damages against Defendant Signal. \n652.  Each Plaintiff is a member of a racial minority, as contemplated by 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1981. \n653.  The actions of Defendant Signal, as set forth herein, violated Plaintiffsโ rights to \nreceive full and equal benefit of all laws as guaranteed by 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981, including Plaintiffsโ \nrights to enjoy and benefit from non-discriminatory employment relationships with Defendant \nSignal. \n 144 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 148 of 158\n654.  Specifically, Defendant Signal subjected Plaintiffs to discriminatory and offensive \nmandatory room and board arrangements at Signal man camps in Pascagoula.  Defendant Signal \ndid not subject its employees of non-Indian race, ethnicity, or alienage to the same or similar \nroom and board arrangements. \n655.  As set forth in the preceding paragraphs, Defendant Signal also imposed \ndiscriminatory job-related requirements and adverse terms and conditions of employment to \nwhich its employees of non-Indian race, ethnicity, or alienage were not similarly subject. \n656.  As set forth in the preceding paragraphs, Defendant Signal also created and \nfostered a discriminatory work environment in which Indian workers were subjected to anti-\nIndian invectives throughout the time Plaintiffs were employed, and in which Signal forced Sikh \nworkers to shave religiously mandated beards.  Signal employees of non-Indian race, ethnicity, \nor alienage or not of the Sikh religion were not subjected to a similar work environment. \n657.  As set forth in the preceding paragraphs, through the actions and statements of its \npersonnel referring to and/or directed at Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers, Defendant \nSignal maintained an objectively hostile and abusive work environment on account of Plaintiffsโ \nrace, ethnicity, religion, and alienage throughout the time Plaintiffs were employed. \n658.  As set forth in the preceding paragraphs, Defendant Signal's discriminatory and \noffensive treatment of Plaintiffs was sufficiently severe that it created a hostile work \nenvironment in violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981 throughout the time Plaintiffs were employed. \n659.  Plaintiffs reasonably perceived their work environment to be hostile, abusive, and \ndiscriminatory on the basis of their race, ethnicity, religion, and alienage. \n660.  Defendant Signal's hostile, abusive, and discriminatory treatment of Plaintiffs and \nother class members was unwelcome. \n 145 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 149 of 158\n661.  Defendant Signal knowingly, willfully, maliciously, intentionally, and without \njustification acted to deprive Plaintiffs of their rights. \n662.  Defendantsโ actions evince malice and/or reckless indifference towards Plaintiffs. \n663.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ knowing, willing, and intentional \nactions, each Plaintiff has been injured, and is entitled to recover damages for the period up to \nand including the time that Plaintiffs were employed by Signal.  Those damages include \ncompensatory damages (including, without limitation, loss of wages, loss of opportunity, pain \nand suffering, mental and emotional distress, prejudgment interest, and additional economic loss \nfrom (1) medical expenses; (2) damages related to living and working conditions; and (3) \nmandatory housing and other fees paid to Signal), punitive damages, and attorneysโ fees in an \namount to be proven at trial. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION UNDER MISSISSIPPI LAW AGAINST ALL \nDEFENDANTS \n664.  Each Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n665.  Each Plaintiff brings this claim against all Defendants. \n666.  The actions of Defendants, as set forth herein, constitute fraudulent \nmisrepresentation under Mississippi common law. \n667.  Specifically, Defendants, individually and through their agents, employees, and/or \nrepresentatives, knowingly made materially false and untrue statements and representations to \nPlaintiffs regarding the nature, terms, and conditions of applications and opportunities for \nimmigration status and employment in the United States. \n 146 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 150 of 158\n668.  Defendants and/or their respective agents represented to each Plaintiff that (1) \nPlaintiffs would be eligible for permanent residency given their employment with Signal; (2) \nDefendants would apply for permanent residency in the United States on behalf of Plaintiffs no \nlater than 24 months after the commencement of work; and (3) Plaintiffs would have steady and \nongoing work opportunities in the United States with Defendant Signal. \n669.  At the time each of these representations was made, Defendants knew they were \nfalse or misleading. \n670.  Defendants intended that the false statements made by each Defendant and/or the \nDefendantsโ respective agents, employees, and/or representatives would induce Plaintiffs to pay \nthe exorbitant โrecruitment fees,โ would induce Plaintiffs to leave their homes and jobs abroad, \ntravel to the United States, and work for Signal, and would induce Plaintiffs to pay the room and \nboard fee and other fees extracted by Signal upon the workersโ arrival in the United States. \n671.  Each Plaintiff was entitled to, and did, rely on Defendantsโ representations. \n672.  In reasonable reliance on the false representations of Defendants and their \nrespective agents, employees, and/or representatives regarding green cards, employment \nopportunities, and employment conditions, Plaintiffs paid large sums of money and incurred \nsubstantial debt in the guise of โrecruitment feesโ and other travel and immigration-related fees.  \nSignal knew of these payments, and permitted them to be made to the Agents.   \n673.  In reasonable reliance on the false representations of Defendants and their \nrespective agents, employees, and/or representatives regarding green cards, employment \nopportunities, and employment conditions, Plaintiffs surrendered employment opportunities in \nIndia and abroad, left their homes and families behind, sold personal and real property, secured \nloans at usurious interest rates, traveled to the United States, and worked for Signal.  Further, \n 147 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 151 of 158\nonce in the United States, Plaintiffs continued to work for Signal after receiving repeated \nassurances that Defendantsโ prior representations were in fact true.   \n674.  No later than the first day that Indian workers arrived at Signal, Defendants knew \nthat Plaintiffs and their coworkers believed that Defendants had applied, or were intending to \napply, for permanent residency on behalf of Plaintiffs.  Defendants therefore had an obligation to \ntell Plaintiffs that this was not true.  Defendants failed to do so. \n675.  Defendantsโ actions evince malice and/or reckless indifference towards Plaintiffs. \n676.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ knowing, willing, and intentional \nactions, each Plaintiff has been injured, and is entitled to recover damages for the period up to \nand including the time that Plaintiffs were employed by Signal.  Those damages include \ncompensatory damages (including, without limitation, loss of wages, loss of opportunity, pain \nand suffering, mental and emotional distress, prejudgment interest, and additional economic loss \nfrom (1) recruitment and visa fees paid to Defendants; (2) expenses that Plaintiffs incurred to pay \nsuch fees, including but not limited to interest from loans; (3) medical expenses; (4) damages \nrelated to living and working conditions; and (5) mandatory housing and other fees paid to \nSignal), punitive damages, and attorneysโ fees in an amount to be proven at trial. \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \nNEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATION UNDER MISSISSIPPI LAW AGAINST ALL \nDEFENDANTS \n677.  Each Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n678.  Each Plaintiff brings this claim against all Defendants. \n679.  The actions of Defendants, as set forth herein, constitute negligent \nmisrepresentation under Mississippi common law. \n 148 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 152 of 158\n680.  Specifically, Defendants, individually and through their agents, employees, and/or \nrepresentatives, negligently made materially false and untrue statements and representations to \nPlaintiffs regarding the nature, terms, and conditions of applications and opportunities for \nimmigration status and employment in the United States. \n681.  Defendants represented to each Plaintiff that (1) Plaintiffs would be eligible for \npermanent residency upon the conclusion of their employment with Signal; (2) Defendants \nwould apply for permanent residency in the United States on behalf of Plaintiffs no later than 24 \nmonths after the commencement of work, (3) Plaintiffs would have steady and ongoing work \nopportunities in the United States with Defendant Signal. \n682.  At the time each of these representations was made, Defendants should have \nknown that they were false or misleading. \n683.  Defendants should have known that the false statements made by each Defendant \nand/or the Defendantsโ respective agents, employees, and/or representatives would induce \nPlaintiffs to pay the exorbitant โrecruitment feesโ; would induce Plaintiffs to leave their homes \nand jobs abroad, travel to the United States, and work for Signal; and would induce Plaintiffs to \npay the room and board fee and other fees extracted by Signal upon the workersโ arrival in the \nUnited States. \n684.  Each Plaintiff was entitled to, and did, rely on Defendantsโ representations. \n685.  In reasonable reliance on the negligent representations of the Defendants and their \nrespective agents, employees, and/or representatives regarding green cards, employment \nopportunities, and employment conditions, Plaintiffs paid large sums of money and incurred \nsubstantial debt in the guise of โrecruitment feesโ and other travel and immigration-related fees.  \nSignal knew of these payments, and permitted them to be made to the Agents.   \n 149 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 153 of 158\n686.  In reasonable reliance on the negligent representations of the Defendants and their \nrespective agents, employees, and/or representatives regarding green cards, employment \nopportunities, and employment conditions, Plaintiffs surrendered employment opportunities in \nIndia and abroad, left their homes and families behind, sold personal and real property, secured \nloans at usurious interest rates, traveled to the United States, and worked for Signal.  Further, \nonce in the United States, Plaintiffs continued to work for Signal after receiving repeated \nassurances that Defendantsโ prior representations were in fact true.   \n687.  No later than the first day that Indian workers arrived at Signal, Defendants knew \nthat Plaintiffs and their coworkers believed that Defendants had, or were intending to, apply for \npermanent residency on behalf of Plaintiffs.  Defendants therefore had an obligation to tell \nPlaintiffs that this was not true.  Defendants failed to do so. \n688.  Defendantsโ actions evince malice and/or reckless indifference towards Plaintiffs. \n689.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ negligent actions, Plaintiffs have \nbeen injured, and are entitled to recover damages for the period up to and including the time that \nPlaintiffs were employed by Signal.  Those damages include compensatory damages (including, \nwithout limitation, loss of wages, loss of opportunity, pain and suffering, mental and emotional \ndistress, prejudgment interest, and additional economic loss from (1) recruitment and visa fees \npaid to Defendants; (2) expenses that Plaintiffs incurred to pay such fees, including but not \nlimited to interest from loans; (3) medical expenses; (4) damages related to living and working \nconditions; and (5) mandatory housing and other fees paid to Signal), punitive damages, and \nattorneysโ fees in an amount to be proven at trial. \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \nBREACH OF CONTRACT UNDER MISSISSIPPI LAW AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n 150 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 154 of 158\n690.  Each Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n691.  Each Plaintiff brings this claim against all Defendants. \n692.  The actions of Defendants, as set forth herein, constitute breach of contract under \nMississippi common law. \n693.  Specifically, Defendants, individually and through their agents, employees and/or \nrepresentatives, promised to assist Plaintiffs in applying for and obtaining permanent residency \nand immigration status for Plaintiffs in the United States no later than 24 months after the \ncommencement of work, and promised Plaintiffs steady and ongoing work opportunities in the \nUnited States with Defendant Signal. \n694.  These promises were made in exchange for each Plaintiffโs payment of fees \n(including recruitment, immigration application, and travel fees) to Defendants and their \nemployees, agents, and/or representatives, and in exchange for each Plaintiffโs agreement to \nwork for Signal. \n695.  Each Plaintiff accepted Defendantsโ offers and promises; each Plaintiff paid the \nagreed upon fees, and performed the agreed-upon work. \n696.  Defendants breached their respective contracts with each Plaintiff by failing to \ncomply with their binding promises regarding assistance in applying for and obtaining permanent \nresidency and immigration status for Plaintiffs in the United States no later than 24 months after \nthe commencement of work, and steady and ongoing work opportunities in the United States \nwith Defendant Signal. \n 151 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 155 of 158\n697.  In reliance on these promises, each Plaintiff paid large sums of money and entered \ninto substantial debts, surrendered other employment opportunities, and incurred other financial \nlosses. \n698.  Defendantsโ actions evince malice and/or reckless indifference towards Plaintiffs. \n699.  As a direct result of Defendantsโ breach, Plaintiffs have suffered direct and \nconsequential damages, and are entitled to recover damages for the period up to and including \nthe time that Plaintiffs were employed by Signal.  Those damages include compensatory \ndamages (including, without limitation, loss of wages, loss of opportunity, pain and suffering, \nmental and emotional distress, prejudgment interest, and additional economic loss from (1) \nrecruitment and visa fees paid to Defendants; (2) expenses that Plaintiffs incurred to pay such \nfees, including but not limited to interest from loans; (3) medical expenses; (4) damages related \nto living and working conditions; and (5) mandatory housing and other fees paid to Signal), \npunitive damages, and attorneysโ fees in an amount to be proven at trial. \n 152 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 200   Filed 03/03/14   Page 156 of 158\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request the following relief for the period up to and including \nthe time that Plaintiffs were employed by Signal: \n1.  Compensatory relief, (including, without limitation, loss of wages, loss of \nopportunity, pain and suffering, mental and emotional distress, prejudgment interest, and \nadditional economic loss from (1) recruitment and visa fees paid to Defendants; (2) expenses that \nPlaintiffs incurred to pay such fees, including but not limited to interest from loans; (3) medical \nexpenses; (4) damages related to living and working conditions; and (5) mandatory housing and \nother fees paid to Signal); \n2.

CIVIL ACTION\nPlaintiffs\nVERSUS No. 08-1220\nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL, LLC, et al., SECTION โEโ\nDefendants\nRelated Cases:\nEQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY CIVIL ACTION\nCOMMISSION,\nPlaintiff\nVERSUS No. 12-557\nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL, LLC, et al., SECTION โEโ\nDefendants\nLAKSHMANAN PONNAYAN ACHARI, et al.,\nCIVIL ACTION\nPlaintiffs\nVERSUS No. 13-6218\n (c/w 13-6219, 13-6220,\n13-6221, 14-732)\nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL, LLC, et al., SECTION \"E\"\nDefendants\nApplies To: Achari v. Signal (13-6218 c/w 13-6219, 13-6220, 13-6221)\nORDER  AND REASONS\nBefore the Court is a Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)1 and a Rule 12(c)\n1R. Doc. 148. All documents cited in this order were filed in the master case, Achari v. Signal (13-\n6218). \n1\n\nMotion for Judgment on the Pleadings both filed by defendant Burnett,2 as well as a Motion\nfor Partial Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) filed by defendant Signal International, LLC\n(\"Signal\").3  Plaintiffs oppose  all of the motions.4 Considering the briefs, the record, and the\nparties arguments at oral argument, the court rules as follows. \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nPlaintiffs are citizens of India who secured visas to work in the United States for\nSignal in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Plaintiffs allege the Defendants recruited\nthem to work as temporary workers at Signal's facilities in Pascagoula, Mississippi.\nPlaintiffs further allege Defendants forced them to pay recruitment fees, as well as\nimmigration  processing  and  travel  expenses.  Plaintiffs  allege  that  throughout  their\nrecruitment,  Defendants  promised  them  permanent  residency in  the  United  States,\nhowever, Defendants never took any steps to assist Plaintiffs in applying for or obtaining\ngreen cards. As a result of Defendants' actions, Plaintiffs claim they were discriminated\nagainst and subjected to forced labor as welders, pipefitters, and marine fabrication workers\nfor Signal. At Signal's facilities, Plaintiffs claim Signal forced the workers to live in\ndeplorable conditions and used various tactics to compel the Plaintiffs to continuing\nworking. \nPlaintiffs originally were a part of a putative class action in David v. Signal (08-\n1220)(the \"David case\"). Plaintiffs are current members of the class of Indian workers on\nwhose behalf the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") brought suit in\n2R. Doc. 228. The Court uses \"Burnett\" to collectively refer to the following defendants: Malvern\nC. Burnett, the Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, LLC and the Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, APC. \n3R. Doc. 150.\n4R. Doc. 159, R. Doc. 160, R. Doc.161, R. Doc. 222, R. Doc. 223, and R. Doc. 238. \n2\n\nEEOC v. Signal (12-557)(the \"EEOC case\").5 After the Court denied class certification in the\nDavid case, putative class members filed four separate actions in the Southern District of\nMississippi.6 On October 24, 2013, the four actions were consolidated and transferred to the\nEastern District of Louisiana.7 These four consolidated cases are collectively referred to\nherein as the Achari cases.  \nIn of each the Achari cases, Plaintiffs allege Signal, Burnett, and Dewan8 violated the\nTrafficking Victims Protection Act of 2003 (\"TVPRA\") and Signal violated the Civil Rights\nAct of 1866 (Section 1981).9 Additionally, Plaintiffs in the Krishnakutty case include claims\nunder the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\") (18 U.S.C. ยง 1962\net seq) and the Klu Klux Klan Act (42 U.S.C. ยง 1985) against Signal, Burnett, and Dewan.10\nPlaintiffs in the Achari cases also allege state law claims for fraudulent misrepresentation,\n5The term \"class\" is used collectively to describe the aggrieved individuals who the EEOC\nrepresents and does not implicate Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.\n6Achari v. Signal (13-6218) (47 former putative class members from the David case), Chakkiyattil\nv. Signal (13-6219) (28 former putative class members), Krishnakutty v. Signal (13-6220) (2 former\nputative class members), Devassy v. Signal (13-6221) (13 former putative class members).\n7R. Doc. 47. A fifth case from the Southern District of Mississippi, Singh v. Signal (14-732) was\ntransferred to the Eastern District of Louisiana on April 24, 2014 and consolidated with the Achari cases.\nR. Doc. 240. These motions were filed before the Singh case was transferred to this Court.\n8The Court uses \"Dewan\" to collectively refer to the following defendants: Global Resources, Inc.,\nDewan Consultants, and Sachin Dewan.\n9See R. Doc. 200 (the Achari complaint); R. Doc. 199 (the Chakkiyattil complaint); R. Doc. 201\n(the Krishnakutty complaint); and R. Doc. 198 (the Devassy complaint). In addition to Signal, Burnett,\nand Dewan, plaintiffs in each case name other defendants. In the Achari case, plaintiffs also name Michael\nPol as a defendant. In the Chakkiyattil case, plaintiffs name Billy Wilks, J&M Associates, Inc., and J&M\nMarine, Inc. as defendants. In the Krishnakutty case, plaintiffs name Indo-Amerisoft, LLC and Kurella\nRao as defendants. In the Devassy case, plaintiffs name Kurella Rao, Indo-Amerisoft, LLC and Michael\nPol as defendants. \n10R. Doc. 201, pp. 46-58. The Krishnakutty plaintiffs also name Kurella Rao and Indo-Amerisoft\nas defendants in their claims under RICO and the Klu Klux Klan Act. \n3\n\nnegligent  misrepresentation,  and  breach  of  contract.11  In  addition,  Plaintiffs  in  the\nKrishnakutty case seek relief for money had and received, and breach of fiduciary duty\nunder Mississippi law.12 \nSignal and Burnett had filed motions to dismiss in the Achari cases before they were\ntransferred from the Southern District of Mississippi and consolidated. Once the Achari\ncases were transferred, this Court ordered counsel for Signal and Burnett to re-file their\nmotions to dismiss with a new submission date.13 Both Signal and Burnett filed a Motion\nto Dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).14 The Plaintiffs in the Achari cases jointly filed oppositions\nto both motions.15 Plaintiffs in the Krishnakutty case filed a separate opposition to Burnett's\nmotion to specifically address the arguments made with respect to their claims.16 \nThe Court thereafter ordered Plaintiffs in each case to file an amended complaint.17\nThe Court also directed Signal and the Burnett Defendants to file supplemental memoranda\nclarifying their intention to reassert their motions to dismiss with respect to the amended\n11Four complaints addressed in these motions (Achari, Chakkiyattil, Krisnakutty, and Devassy)\nbring state law claims under Mississippi law. The complaint in the recently transferred Singh case does\nnot specify the law of which state its state law claims arise under. \n12R. Doc. 201, pp. 65-70.\n13R. Doc. 149. \n14R. Doc. 148, R. Doc. 150. \n15R. Doc. 159, R. Doc. 160. \n16R. Doc. 161.\n17R. Doc. 182. The Court instructed the plaintiffs to file amended and restated complaints\nspecifically setting forth the defendants against which each cause of action is asserted, the specific\ndamages sought under each cause of action, and the statute or other law on which the demand is based. \n4\n\ncomplaints.18 Plaintiffs filed supplemental oppositions to Signal and Burnett's supplemental\nmemoranda.19 Burnett also filed a Rule 12(c) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings,20\nwhich Plaintiffs opposed.21 The Court will consider each motion in turn. \nSTANDARD OF LAW\nThe Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss filed by Signal and Burnett and the Burnett's\n12(c) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings are all governed by the same legal standard.\nThe standard for dismissal under Rule 12(c) is the same as that for dismissal for failure to\nstate a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). Johnson v. Johnson, 385 F.3d 503, 528 (5th Cir. 2004). \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a district court may dismiss a\ncomplaint, or any part of it, for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted if\nthe plaintiff has not set forth factual allegations in support of his claim that would entitle\nhim to relief. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007); Cuvillier v. Taylor, 503\nF.3d 397, 401 (5th Cir. 2007). As the Fifth Circuit explained in Gonzales v. Kay:\n\"Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the\nspeculative level.\" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127\nS.Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). The Supreme Court recently\nexpounded upon the Twombly standard, explaining that \"[t]o survive\na motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual\nmatter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on\nits face.\" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 128 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173\nL.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct.\n1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929). \"A Claim has facial plausibility when the\nplaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the\nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct\n18R. Doc. 210. \n19R. Doc. 222, R. Doc. 223. \n20R. Doc. 228. \n21R. Doc. 238. \n5\n\nalleged.\" Id. It follows that \"where the well-pleaded facts do not permit\nthe court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the\ncomplaint has alleged - but it has not 'show[n]' - that the pleader is\nentitled to relief.\" Id. at 1950 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). \n577 F.3d 600, 603 (5th Cir. 2009). \nThe Court cannot look beyond the factual allegations in the pleadings to determine\nwhether relief should be granted. See Spivey v. Robertson, 197 F.3d 772, 774 (5th Cir.\n1999); Baker v. Putnal, 75 F.3d 190, 196 (5th Cir. 1996). In assessing the Plaintiffs'\ncomplaint, the Court must accept all well-pleaded facts as true and liberally construe all\nfactual allegations in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs. Spivey, 197 F.3d at 774;\nLowrey v. Tex A & M Univ. Sys., 117 F.3d 242, 247 (5th Cir. 1997). \"Dismissal is appropriate\nwhen the complaint 'on its face show[s] a bar to relief.\" Cutrer v. McMillan, 308 F. App'x\n819, 820 (5th Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (unpublished) (quoting Clark v. Amoco Prod. Co.,\n794 F.2d 967, 970 (5th Cir. 1986)).  A court may grant a motion for judgment on the\npleadings when no genuine issues of material fact remain and the case can be decided as a\nmatter of law.  Erickson v. Pardus, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007).\nANALYSIS\nA. Signal's Motion to Partially Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim22\nSignal seeks dismissal of Plaintiffs' state law claims, claim for recruitment fees under\n1981, and claim for recruitment fees under the Klu Klux Klan Act. With respect to Plaintiffs'\nstate law claims, Signal argues those claims arise from the Plaintiffs' recruitment abroad to\nwork in the United States, and under Mississippi law, Plaintiffs' claims are implausible.23\nSimilarly, Signal argues Plaintiffs' claims for recruitment fees under Section 1981 and the\n22R. Doc. 150.\n23R. Doc. 150, p. 18. \n6\n\nKlu Klux Klan Act arise out of events occurring abroad and those statutes do not apply\nextraterritorially.24\n1. State Law Claims\nIn each of the Achari cases, Plaintiffs claim that all Defendants promised to secure\nthem permanent residency after their employment with Signal. Plaintiffs allege they paid\nexorbitant \"recruitment fees\" to the Defendants for processing immigration documents, yet\nDefendants failed to secure permanent residency for the Plaintiffs after their arrival in the\nUnited States. Plaintiffs also claim the Defendants misrepresented the nature of Plaintiff's\nemployment and immigration opportunities in the United States. For the Defendants'\nalleged failure to fulfill their promises to secure permanent residency, Plaintiffs assert\nbreach  of  contract  claims  under  Mississippi  law.  For  the  Defendants'  alleged  false\nrepresentations regarding Plaintiffs' opportunities for immigration and employment status,\nPlaintiffs assert fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation claims under Mississippi law.\nSignal argues the facts giving rise to Plaintiffs' state law claims involve Signal's alleged\nwrongdoing abroad. Signal believes the state law claims have a \"foreign basis\" because\nPlaintiffs' recruitment began in either India or the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Signal cites\nto Mississippi's choice-of-law rules to argue the state law claims are implausible because\nMississippi  law  would  not  recognize  claims  arising  from  events  occurring  abroad.\nAdditionally, the Krishnakutty Plaintiffs allege Defendants breached a fiduciary duty to\nPlaintiffs by failing to fulfill promises to obtain permanent residency or by misrepresenting\nPlaintiffs' ability to secure permanent residency.  The basis of the Krishnakutty Plaintiffs'\n24R. Doc. 150, p. 22.\n7\n\nclaims for money had and received is identical.  \nThe questions of which state's choice of law rules apply and which state's substantive\nlaw applies are questions of law for the Court.  These issues have not yet been decided and,\nas a result, Signal is not entitled to dismissal of the Plaintiffs' state law claims because it has\nnot established that the facts as alleged, accepted as true, fail to state a claim to relief that\nis plausible on its face. The Court cannot reasonably infer the defendant is liable or not\nliable for the misconduct alleged unless it knows the applicable law.  Accordingly, Signal's\nmotion to dismiss the Plaintiffs' state law claims is denied. Signal may refile its motion to\ndismiss the state law claims once these choice of law issues have been decided.25\n2. Claims under Section 1981 and the Klu Klux Klan Act\nPlaintiffs allege Signal unlawfully subjected the Plaintiffs to discriminatory terms\nand conditions of employment at Signal's facilities in Pascagoula, Mississippi based on race,\nethnicity, religion and alienage. Plaintiffs assert Signal violated 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981, which\nprohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of race.26 The Krisnakutty Plaintiffs\ninclude a claim under the Klu Klux Klan Act (42 U.S.C. ยง 1985), alleging Defendants\nconspired to deprive Plaintiffs of their Thirteenth Amendment rights to be free from forced\nlabor and involuntary servitude. Signal moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims under Section\n25Because this Court has federal question jurisdiction and is exercising supplemental jurisdiction\nover Plaintiffs' state law claims, the Court must apply the law in the state in which it sits. Erie Railroad Co.\nv. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). This includes the choice-of-law rules of the\nforum state. Klaxon v. Stentor Electric Manufacturing Co., 313 U.S. 487 (1941). When a case is\ntransferred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1404(a), courts apply the choice-of-law rules of the transferor state.\nFerens v. John Deere, 494 U.S. 516, 525 (1990). However, whether the Ferens rule applies to cases\ntransferred pursuant to the first-filed rule, such as this one, is unsettled. Accordingly, it is unclear which\nstate's choice-of-law rules apply to this case, and it is unclear which state's substantive laws apply.  \n26Section 1981 refers to racial discrimination in the making an enforcement of contracts, but the\nstatute has been read to provide a federal remedy against discrimination in employment on the basis of\nrace. See Adams v. McDougal, 695 F.2d 104 (5th Cir. 1983). \n8\n\n1981 and the Klu Klux Klan Act insofar as those claims seek recovery of recruitment fees\npaid abroad. Signal asserts Plaintiffs' recruitment occurred abroad and neither Section 1981\nnor the Klu Klux Klan Act apply extraterritorially. \nPlaintiffs' amended complaints do not seek recovery of recruitment fees under\nSection 1981 or the Klu Klux Klan Act.27 Plaintiffs' claims under Section 1981 are rooted in\nSignal's  alleged  discriminatory  acts  at  Signal's  facility  in  the  United  States.  The\nKrishnakutty Plaintiffs' Klu Klux Klan Act claims relate to Signal's alleged conspiracy to\ndeprive Plaintiffs' Thirteenth Amendment rights at Signal's Facilities in the United States.\nIn contrast, in each of the Plaintiffs' claims under TVPA, the Plaintiffs explicitly pray for\neconomic loss from recruitment fees paid to the Defendants.28 Thus, because the Plaintiffs\ndo not pray for recruitment fees under its Section 1981 or Klu Klux Klan Act claims, Signal's\nmotion to dismiss those claims is moot. \n27In the Achari case, Plaintiffs seek: \"compensatory damages (including, without limitation, loss of\nwages, loss of opportunity, pain and suffering, mental and emotional distress, prejudgment interest, and\nadditional economic loss from (1) medical expenses; (2) damages related to living and working conditions;\nand (3) mandatory housing and other fees paid to Signal), punitive damages, attorneys' fees in an amount\nto be proven at trial.\" See R. Doc. 200, p. 149. Plaintiffs in the Krishnakutty case seek: \"lost and unpaid\nwages, lost opportunities, pain and suffering (including emotional distress and humiliation), out-of-pocket\nexpenses, and other pecuniary losses including loss of property and/or business.\" See R. Doc. 201, p. 57.\nPlaintiffs in the Chakkiyatil case seek \"[C]ompensatory damages [including] housing fees paid to Signal\nand other charges made by Signal, adverse terms and conditions of employment resulting from\ndiscrimination (including underpayment of wages), pain, suffering, medical costs and lost wages resulting\nfrom on-the-job physical injuries related to discriminatory working conditions, damages related to living\nand working conditions, and damages suffered due to mental and emotional distress, as well as\nopportunity costs, out-of-pocket costs, and other pecuniary losses.\" See R. Doc. 199, p. 116. Plaintiffs in the\nDevassy case seek damages including: \"housing fees paid to Signal and other charges made by Signal,\nadverse terms and conditions of employment resulting from discrimination (including underpayment of\nwages), pain, suffering, medical costs and lost wages resulting from on-the-job physical injuries related to\ndiscriminatory working conditions, damages related to living and working conditions, and damages\nsuffered due to mental and emotional distress, as well as opportunity costs, out-of-pocket costs, and other\npecuniary damages.\" See R. Doc. 198, p. 72.\n28For example, in the Achari case, Plaintiffs pray for \"economic loss from recruitment and visa\nfees paid to Defendants.\" R. Doc. 200, p. 147. In the Chakkiyatil case, Plaintiffs pray for \"compensatory\nand punitive damages ... including recruitment fees.\" R. Doc. 199, p. 114. In the Devassy case, Plaintiffs\npray for \"compensatory and punitive damages, including recruitment fees...\" R. Doc. 198, p. 70.  \n9\n\nAccordingly, for the above stated reasons, Signal's 12(b)(6) Motion to Partially\nDismiss is DENIED as to the Plaintiffs' state law claims and DENIED AS MOOT as to\nclaims for recruiting fees under Section 1981 and the Klu Klux Klan Act. \nB. Burnett's 12(b)(6) Motion29\nBurnett  moves  to  dismiss  the  entirety  of  Plaintiffs'  complaints,  arguing  the\ncomplaints only allege \"unsupported and unsupportable conclusions\" as to all Defendants,\nand do not include factual material sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Burnett\nadditionally asserts Plaintiffs have not pled the allegations of fraud with the specificity\nrequired under Rule 9. With respect to Plaintiffs' state law claims, Burnett argues the acts\nalleged to form the basis of those claims occurred in India and the United Arab Emirates\nand are thus implausible under Mississippi law. Finally, Burnett argues Plaintiffs' state law\nclaims are barred by the passing of the statute of limitations.\n1. Sufficiency of Factual Material Alleged\na. TVPA Claims\nBurnett argues Plaintiffs' complaints lack factual allegations sufficient to state a\nclaim under the TVPA.  Burnett asserts Plaintiffs do not allege that Burnett ever forced\nPlaintiffs to work for Signal or ever threatened any Plaintiff with deportation if they refused\nto  continue  working  for  Signal.  Burnett  believes  he  provided  legal  and  necessary\nimmigration services to allow Plaintiffs to enter the United States. \nPlaintiffs' complaints include two related claims under the TVPA: a claim for forced\nlabor under 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589 (\"Section 1589\"), and a claim for trafficking under 18 U.S.C.\n29R. Doc. 148.\n10\n\nยง 1590 (\"Section 1590\"). Under 18 U.S.C. ยง 1595 (\"Section 1595\"), an individual who is a\nvictim of a violation under the TVPA  may bring a civil action against anyone who\n\"knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value from participation in a\nventure which that person know or should have known has engaged in an act in violation\nof [the TVPA].\" 18 U.S.C. ยง 1595. \nPlaintiffs seek relief under Section 1589, which prohibits anyone who \"knowingly\nprovides or obtains the labor or services of a person by any one of, or by any combination\nof, the following means: (1) by means of force, threats of force, physical restraint, or threats\nof physical restraint to that person or another person; (2) by means of serious harm or\nthreats of serious harm to that person or another person; (3) by means of the abuse or\nthreatened abuse of law or legal process; or (4) by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern\nintended to cause the person to believe that, if that person did not perform such labor or\nservices, that person or another person would suffer serious harm or restraint.\" 18 U.S.C.\nยง 1589.\nPlaintiffs allege Burnett placed advertisements and conducted seminars in Indian\ncities to recruit workers for Signal, promising \"employment based green cards\" and\npermanent residency in the United States.30 Plaintiffs' claim Burnett promised them green\ncards in order to induce Plaintiffs to pay large fees to travel and work in the United States.31\nPlaintiffs allege Burnett never took any steps to apply for permanent residency for the\nPlaintiffs.32 Based on their \"need to repay the substantial debt and interest [they] incurred\"\n30See, e.g., R. Doc. 200, pp. 21-22. \n31Id. at p. 22. \n32Id. at p. 23. \n11\n\nto pay Burnett's recruitment fees, Plaintiffs allege they felt \"intimidated into acquiescence\nand compelled to continue working for Signal.\"33 Plaintiffs allegations are sufficient to state\na claim under Section 1589(a)(2) for using \"serious harm\" to provide or obtain Plaintiffs'\nlabor.34\nUnder Section 1589(c)(2), \"serious harm\" includes financial harm \"that is sufficiently\nserious ... to compel a reasonable person .. to perform or to continue performing labor\nservices in order to avoid incurring that harm.\" Courts have found that threats of being in\ndebt and being unable to repay those debts constitutes \"serious harm\" sufficient to survive\na motion to dismiss. See Nunag-Tanedo v. East Baton Rouge Parish School Bd., 790 F.\nSupp. 2d 1134 (C.D. Cal. 2011); Panwar v. Access Therapies, Inc., 2013 WL 5486783 (S.D.\nInd. Sept. 30, 2013). Because Plaintiffs have alleged Burnett induced them into incurring\nsubstantial debts and Plaintiffs felt compelled to continue working to repay those debts,\nPlaintiffs' complaints contain sufficient facts to state a claim under Section 1589(a)(2). \nPlaintiffs also allege Burnett violated Section 1590 of the TVPA. Section 1590\nprovides a claim against any person who \"knowingly recruits, harbors, transports, provides,\nor obtains by any means, any person for labor or services in violation of this chapter...\" 18\nU.S.C. ยง 1590. The violations of Section 1589 are included in the chapter for violations of\nSection 1590. Thus, because Plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts to state a claim under\nSection 1589, Plaintiffs have also pled sufficient facts to state a claim under Section 1590\nagainst Burnett as a person who recruited Plaintiffs for labor in violation of Section 1589.\n33See, e.g., r. Doc. 200, p. 85. \n34As Plaintiffs point out in their original opposition, their allegations are also likely sufficient to\nstate a claim under Section 1589(a)(3) for using \"abuse of the legal process\" to provide Plaintiffs' labor. \n12\n\nSee Nunag-Tanedo, 790 F. Supp. 2d at 1147 (\"Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that\nDefendants are involved in a fraudulent scheme involving forced labor, and with the\nintentional nature of this matter Plaintiffs have also sufficiently alleged that Defendants\nrecruited, transported, and provided Plaintiffs for that forced labor.\").\nIn sum, Plaintiffs claims under the TVPA are sufficiently supported by factual\nallegations in each complaint. Burnett insists his actions were \"consistent with what would\nhappen in the ordinary course of events in representing non-immigrant workers recruited\nfor work in the United States.\"35 However, Burnett's disagreement over the version of the\nfacts alleged in Plaintiffs' complaints is insufficient to support a motion to dismiss. The\nCourt must accept all factual allegations in Plaintiffs' complaints as true, and Burnett has\nfailed to show Plaintiffs' claims under the TVPA should be dismissed. \nb. State Law Claims\nBurnett  also  argues  Plaintiffs'  complaint  does  not  set  forth  sufficient  factual\nallegations to support their state law claims for fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent\nmisrepresentation, and breach of contract. Burnett asserts the facts alleged demonstrate\na \"fulfillment of Burnett's obligations to the Plaintiffs.\"\nAs explained above, the questions of which state's choice of law rules apply and\nwhich state's substantive laws apply have not yet been decided. As a result, Burnett is not\nentitled to dismissal of the Plaintiffs' state law claims because he has not established that\nthe facts as alleged, accepted as true, fail to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. \nThe Court does find that Plaintiffs have satisfied Rule 9(b)'s requirement of pleading fraud\n35R. Doc. 148, p. 6. \n13\n\nwith particularity. Accordingly, Burnett's motion to dismiss the Plaintiffs' state law claims\nis denied. Burnett may refile his motion to dismiss the state law claims, to the extent that\nit is not based on Rule 9(b), once choice of law issues have been decided. \n2. Extraterritoriality\nBurnett moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' state law claims by briefly putting forth the same\nargument as Signal. That is, because a portion of the facts giving rise to Plaintiffs' state law\nclaims occurred abroad, Burnett argues those claims should be brought under the laws of\nIndia or the UAE. Burnett asserts Plaintiffs' complaint does not show a remedy exists under\nIndian law, thus Plaintiffs' state law claims should be dismissed. \nAs explained above, the questions of which state's choice of law rules apply and\nwhich state's substantive laws apply have not yet been decided. As a result, Burnett is not\nentitled to dismissal of the Plaintiffs' state law claims because he has not established that\nthe facts as alleged, accepted as true, fail to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. \nAccordingly, Burnett's motion to dismiss the Plaintiffs' state law claims is denied. Burnett\nmay refile his motion to dismiss the state law claims once choice of law issues have been\ndecided. \n3. Statute of Limitations\nLastly, Burnett seeks dismissal of Plaintiffs' state law claims for fraud, negligent\nmisrepresentation  and breach of  contract  asserting  the  statute  of  limitations  under\nMississippi law ran by March 8, 2011.36  \nAs explained above, the questions of which state's choice of law rules apply and\n36R. Doc. 148-1, p. 7. \n14\n\nwhich state's substantive laws apply have not yet been decided. As a result, Burnett is not\nentitled to dismissal of the Plaintiffs' state law claims because he has not established that\nthe facts as alleged, accepted as true, fail to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. \nAccordingly, Burnett's motion to dismiss the Plaintiffs' state law claims is denied. Burnett\nmay refile his motion to dismiss the state law claims once choice of law issues have been\ndecided. \nC. Burnett's 12(c) Motion37\nBurnett filed a Rule 12(c) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings in Achari v. Signal\n(13-6218) seeking to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims based on the same grounds as his Rule\n12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss. For the reasons discussed above, Burnett has not carried his\nburden  of  showing  dismissal  is  warranted.  Accordingly,  Burnett's  12(c)  Motion  for\nJudgment on the Pleadings is DENIED. \nCONCLUSION\nFor the above-stated reasons, IT IS ORDERED that Signal's 12(b)(6) Motion for\nPartial Dismissal be and hereby is DENIED as to the Plaintiffs' state law claims and\nDENIED AS MOOT as to claims for recruiting fees under Section 1981 and the Klu Klux\nKlan Act.  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Burnett's Rule 12(b)(6) Motion for Partial\nDismissal be and hereby is DENIED. \nIT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  Burnett's  Rule  12(c)  Motion  for  Partial\nJudgment on the Pleadings be and hereby is DENIED. \n37R. Doc. 228.\n15\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana, this 13th day of August, 2014.\n____________________________\n         SUSIE MORGAN\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n16",

This is a human trafficking case brought by foreign workers trafficked into the \nState of Mississippi.  It is grounded in laws passed by the United States Congress to combat this \nvery problem.  Rather than hiring new workers from the Gulf Coast in the wake of a devastating \nhurricane, the Defendants instead turned the Plaintiffs into an exploitable source of cheap labor. \nThe Defendants then worked together to defraud each of the Plaintiffs out of tens of thousands of \ndollars, falsely promised them assistance in applying for and obtaining permanent residence in \nthe United States, trafficked them into the United States, forced them to live in squalid and \nunsanitary conditions that damaged Plaintiffs' health and psychological well-being, \ndiscriminated against them on the basis of their race, ethnicity, religion, and alienage, and \nthreatened them with financial ruin and adverse immigration action if they balked. \n2.  Plaintiffs Lakshmanan Ponnayan Achari, Kodakeril Baby Biji, Xavier Disoliyan, \nRajankunju Geevarghese, Jomon George, Shaiju Vadakkal George, Mouleswararao \nGuntamukkala, Joy Jacob, Biju John, Shibu Joseph, Sunilkumar Marottikkal Kuttan, Parshottam \nRamchandra Mangani, Prakash Moses Kanagiah Manonmoni, Adharsan Manuel, Jacob \nMazhukkattu Mathew, Johny Mathew, Nandhakumar Nagaraj, Shaji Veluthalakuzhiyil Nanoo, \nMangalan Chandrasekharan Pillai, Radhakrishna Pillai Sivarama Pillai, Aby Molathu Poulose, \nJustin Poulose, Appunni Arul Prakash, Sreenivasarao Raparthy, Mookaparambil !tty \nRaveendranathan, Balwinder Singh, Ranjit Singh, Shanmugam Subramanian, Ninan John \nTharakan, George Pulikkeparambil Varghese, Benny Kattukariyil Varkey, Shahi Vijayan, and \nJohn Yohannan, each a former employee at Signal International, LLC and Signal International, \nInc.'s (collectively \"Signal\") Pascagoula, Mississippi facility, bring this action to recover for the \nunlawful and fraudulent behavior by Defendant Signal and Signal's agents Malvern C. Burnett, \nthe Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, LLC, Sachin \n1 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 5 of 106\nDewan, Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd., Michael Pol, and Global Resources Inc. (referred to \nhereafter as the \"Agents\"). \n3.  Signal is a Gulf Coast-based marine and fabrication company.  In the aftermath of \nHurricane Katrina, Signal set out to recruit several hundred foreign workers to work as \ntemporary welders and pipefitters in Signal's Pascagoula, Mississippi facility.  Signal also \nrecruited workers to work at a Signal facility in Orange, Texas. \n4.  To assist in that process, Signal retained Michael Pol and his company Global \nResources, Inc. (\"Global\"), a labor recruitment firm with operations in Mississippi; Malvern C. \nBurnett, an attorney based in Mississippi and Louisiana; and Sachin Dewan, a labor recruiter in \nIndia, to recruit workers on Signal's behalf.  Signal also executed a power of attorney \nauthorizing Dewan's company, Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd., to recruit for Signal abroad. \n5.  The cornerstone of the Defendants' scheme was the tantalizing prospect that \nSignal would be able to hire a skilled workforce at effectively no cost by forcing the Plaintiffs \nand their coworkers to foot the bill for their own recruitment, immigration processing, and travel. \nIndeed, an April 18, 2006  \"Skilled Worker Recruitment Agreement\" between Signal and Global \nthat set this scheme in motion expressly stated that the workers would be delivered at no cost to \nSignal and that all other charges, expenses and fees would be paid by the workers themselves or \nby Global, who in tum would be reimbursed through deductions from the Plaintiffs' wages.  In \nshort, Defendants paid nothing; the future employees paid everything. \n6.  Begirming in mid-2006, Signal, both via its own employees and via its external \nAgents, traveled to India in order to recruit workers, including each of the Plaintiffs.  In printed \nadvertisements and in-person meetings in India, Defendants promised Plaintiffs that in exchange \nfor \"recruitment fees\" payable to the Agents ranging anywhere from the equivalent of $1 0,000 to \n2 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 6 of 106\n$25,000, Defendants would provide Plaintiffs with jobs at Signal and assist them in applying for \nand receiving green cards. \n7.  Defendants told Plaintiffs that because the permanent residency process could \ntake up to two years to complete and Signal's need for workers was immediate, Defendants \nwould first assist Plaintiffs in obtaining temporary work visas, known as H-2B visas, while \nsimultaneously applying for green cards. \n8.  Lured by the promise of, in the words of one of the Defendants' advertisements, \nthe opportunity for \"permanent lifetime settlement in the U.S.A. for self and family,\" Plaintiffs \ntook on immense burdens to gather enormous fees, often by selling family assets and incurring \nsignificant debt at usurious rates.  Plaintiffs did this because they believed they would recoup the \nexpense with the high wages they were promised at Signal, and through the long-term \nemployment opportunities that would be available to them and their families as permanent \nresidents of the United States. \n9.  In actuality, the Defendants' promises regarding green cards for Plaintiffs were \nillusory.  Defendants had not taken, and had no intention at that time of taking, any steps to assist \nthe Plaintiffs in applying for or receiving green cards.  To the contrary, Signal (with the \nknowledge and assistance of the Agents) represented to the United States government that it \nwould employ the workers only temporarily, and that the workers would be returned to India \n\"within the ...y ear.\"  At no point did Signal or any of the Agents take any steps to assist and \nPlaintiff in applying for or receiving a green card. \n10.  Plaintiffs, of course, were never told of Signal's representations to the United \nStates government.  The Plaintiffs were unaware that Defendants' promises of employment and \npermanent residency were false and relied on these false promises to their detriment. \n3 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 7 of 106\n11.  Put simply, Plaintiffs had been deceived into taking on life-altering debt for \nsomething that was never going to happen. \n12.  Upon arrival at Signal's facilities in Mississippi, Plaintiffs' plight only worsened. \nSignal utilized psychological abuse, coercion, and fraud to leave Plaintiffs afraid and unable to \nleave Signal's facilities and employ.  Plaintiffs were required to live in camps on Signal's \nPascagoula premises, enduring barbaric and prison-like conditions.  Plaintiffs were among \nseveral hundred men crammed into trailer-like bunkhouses that were far too small for the number \nof men housed therein, and otherwise unfit for human habitation.  Privacy was non-existent. \nToilet and bathing facilities were insufficient.  Food was often rotten.  Private \"security guards\" \npatrolled the grounds like prison guards, prevented the Plaintiffs from leaving, and subjected the \nPlaintiffs to random searches of their persons and belongings. \n13.  Signal sought to deflect as much of the housing costs as possible onto the \nPlaintiffs.  For the \"privilege\" ofliving in prison-like squalor, Signal deducted $35 per day from \nPlaintiffs' paychecks, seven days a week, which constituted over 34% of the workers' pre-tax \nearnings.  When workers requested permission to live off-site, they were told by Signal that they \ncould do so, but that Signal would continue to collect the $35 per day.  This compulsory \ndeduction essentially prohibited Plaintiffs from living in more humane conditions, lest their work \nbecome even less remunerative, and consequently their \"recruiting fee\" debt become even more \ncrushing. \n14.  Non-Indian workers were not subjected to such squalid living conditions, \ndegrading treatment, or extortionate room and board policies. \nIS.  Plaintiffs were also made to work in unsafe working conditions that non-Indian \nworkers were not subjected to, and were forced to endure regular anti-Indian invective from \n4 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 8 of 106\nSignal personnel, along with threats to deport them if they did not do Signal's every bidding. \nIndeed, Signal housed Plaintiffs in the so-called \"man camps\" so that they would not mix with \nthe Pascagoula community.  The Signal executive supervising the Pascagoula man camp referred \nto the facility-privately and in professional correspondence to other Signal employees-as \"the \nReservation,\" a term adopted from Signal's \"shipyard folks.\"  Another Signal employee was \nmore direct, promising Signal management on April 5, 2007 that if he were placed in charge of \nthe man camp, he would not give in to the \"misguided notion that some of these Indians can be \n1 \nreasoned with\" but would instead \"most defiantly [sic  go on a 'rat hunt. \", \n16.  Signal even forced men of Sikh heritage to shave their beards upon arriving in the \ncamp.  Wearing of a beard is an extremely important religious tradition to Sikh men, and \nSignal's coercion left the men, including Plaintiff Ranjit Singh, reduced to tears. \n17.  Conditions were so poor at Signal's Pascagoula facility that, after just a couple \nmonths, workers (including Plaintiffs) began to consider ways to convince Signal to improve \nconditions.  In retaliation for the workers' attempts to improve their lot, Signal terminated the \nemployment of three of the most outspoken workers, forcibly removed them from the camp and \ntold them they would be immediately returned them to India.  One of those expelled men, so \ndistraught over the thought of returning to India with the crushing debt of the \"recruitment fees,\" \nattempted suicide in front of one of the Plaintiffs. \n18.  Signal used this horrifying incident to its advantage.  In a meeting with the \nworkers (including the Plaintiffs) days after the attempted suicide, Signal told Plaintiffs that if \nany of the Signal workers filed a lawsuit against Signal, Signal would send all of the workers \nback to India.  The Plaintiffs understood this to mean that they must remain quiescent and work, \nlest Signal retaliate and ruin them financially. \n5 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 9 of 106\n19.  Signal employed other methods of forcing the Plaintiffs to endure the abusive \nconditions.  In keeping with its focus on deflecting labor costs, upon Plaintiffs' arrival, Signal \nrequired workers to set up \"direct deposit\" bank accounts with a local bank, to which Signal also \nhad access.  These accounts gave Signal control over the worker's ability to leave the facility \nbecause Signal could threaten to cut off the workers' access to the accounts at any point.  Indeed, \nthis is exactly what happened-in April, 2007, after certain workers fled the Pascagoula camp, \nthose workers were denied access to their accounts, at the behest of Signal.  This had the \nintended effect of intimidating and coercing the remaining workers, including Plaintiffs, into \ncompliance. \n20.  Deeply indebted, fearful, isolated, disoriented, and unfamiliar with their rights \nunder United States law, Plaintiffs felt compelled to continue working for Signal, on Signal's \nonerous terms and in abusive conditions. \n21.  In line with Signal's original intention as expressed to the United States \ngovernment-but not to the Plaintiffs-to employ the workers temporarily, Plaintiffs were all \nterminated within a year and a half of arriving in Pascagoula, or left to escape the horrid \nconditions. \n22.  At no point did Signal or the Agents ever apply for, or assist Plaintiffs in applying \nfor, permanent residency.  Moreover, consistent with its never-failing effort to improve its \nbottom line by transferring as many costs associated with their employment as possible back \nonto Plaintiffs, Signal never refunded the tens of thousands of dollars in \"recruitment fees\" \nPlaintiffs had paid in exchange for less than one year of low-paid work.  None of the Plaintiffs \nearned enough money at Signal to make the exorbitant and debt-inducing \"recruitment fees\" \n6 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 10 of 106\neven remotely worthwhile.  Moreover, Signal never compensated Plaintiffs in any way for the \nphysical, emotional, and psychological degradations inflicted upon them at the Pascagoula camp. \n23.  In short, and as will be alleged more fully below, Defendants' promises of \nemployment-based green cards were fictional: \nโข  Defendants never filed or otherwise supported green card applications for \nPlaintiffs, or took any other steps toward assisting Plaintiffs with securing \ngreen cards; \nโข  Defendants told United States Department of Homeland Security under \npenalty of perjury that Signal's need for workers was temporary; \nโข  Signal has stated in court filings that it never intended to provide the \nworkers with green cards, but rather with temporary H-2B visas; \nโข  Defendants segregated and confined Plaintiffs and other Indian workers to \nthe man camp because Defendants did not want Indian workers mixing \nwith other members of the Pascagoula community; and \nโข  Internal correspondence among Signal management in May 2006 shows \nthat \"[a)ll [Signal is) doing now is bringing the workers in under the H2B \nprogram.\" \nDefendants' Conduct Violated Congress's Clear Prohibition Against Human Trafficking \n24.  In 2000, Congress enacted the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act \n(\"TVPA\") to provide enhanced legal protections for victims of human trafficking and to \nsupplement existing forms of relief.  Congress specifically included protections for persons \nforced to work out of fear of serious harm, physical restraint, abuse of the legal process, or \nthreats of the same. \n25.  According to House Report I 06-939, the new statute was \"intended to address the \nincreasingly subtle methods of traffickers who place their victims in modem-day slavery, such as \nwhere traffickers threaten harm to third persons, restrain their victims without physical violence \nor injury, or threaten dire consequences by means other than overt violence.\"  In particular, \n7 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 11 of 106\nCongress clarified that the statute covered \"a broad array of harms, including both physical and \nnonphysical,\" and could apply where the perpetrator \"intentionally caus[ ed] the victim to believe \nthat her family [would] face harms such as banishment, starvation, or bankruptcy in their home \ncountry.\" \n26.  In 2003, Congress amended the statute to permit individual victims of trafficking \nto bring civil claims against their traffickers.  Plaintiffs do so here.  Plaintiffs also bring claims \nfor violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent \nmisrepresentation, and breach of contract. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n27.

Defendants Signal International, LLC and Signal International, Inc. are \ncorporations organized under the laws of Delaware, with facilities in the Gulf Coast region, \nincluding Pascagoula, Mississippi.  At all relevant times, Signal International, LLC acted as an \nagent and/or alter ego of Signal International, Inc., and took all conduct discussed herein with the \nknowledge and consent of Signal International Inc.  Signal International, LLC and Signal \nInternational, Inc. will be referred to collectively below as \"Signal\" unless a distinction is drawn \nbetween them.  Signal provides marine and fabrication services, including offshore drilling rig \noverhaul, repair, upgrade and conversion. \n65.  Defendant Global Resources, Inc. (\"Global\") is a corporation organized under the \nlaws of Mississippi that recruits workers from India for employment in the United States. \n12 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 16 of 106\n66.  Defendant Michael Pol (\"Pol\") was, at all relevant times, the President of Global \nResources, Inc., and resides in Mississippi.  On information and belief, Pol was, at all relevant \ntimes, the sole corporate officer of Global.  Pol and Global Resources, Inc. are alter egos.  Global \nand Pol will be referred to collectively below as \"Pol,\" unless a distinction is drawn between \nthem. \n67.  Defendant Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd. (alkla Medtech Consultants) (\"Dewan \nConsultants\") is a private limited liability company organized under the laws of India.  Dewan \nConsultants has substantial business contacts with Pascagoula, Mississippi.  In 2004, Dewan \nConsultants contracted with Global and Burnett - through the Gulf Coast Immigration Law \nCenter, LLC - to identify and recruit Indian workers for employment in the United States on \npermanent residency visas. \n68.  Defendant Sachin Dewan (\"Dewan\") is the Director of Dewan Consultants. \nDewan resides in India and has, since at least 2005, had substantial business contacts with \nPascagoula, Mississippi, including travel to Pascagoula on behalf of Signal and Dewan \nConsultants.  Dewan and Dewan Consultants will be referred to collectively below as \"Dewan,\" \nunless a distinction is drawn between them. \n69.  Defendant Malvern C. Burnett (\"Burnett\") is an attorney who is registered to vote \nin Mississippi and maintains offices in Ocean Springs, Mississippi.  Burnett used his Ocean \nSprings office to perform much ofthe legal work necessary to bring Plaintiffs and other Indian \nworkers to the United States on H-2B Visas. \n70.  Defendant Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C. (\"Burnett Law Offices\") is \na professional law corporation organized under the laws of Louisiana that maintains offices in \nOcean Springs, Mississippi. \n13 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 17 of 106\n71.  Defendant Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, LLC (\"Gulf Coast Immigration\") \nis a limited liability corporation organized under the laws of Louisiana that maintains offices \nMississippi.  Burnett is the registered agent of Gulf Coast Immigration.  On information and \nbelief, Burnett is the sole member andlor corporate officer of Gulf Coast Immigration.  Burnett, \nthe Burnett Law Offices and Gulf Coast Immigration operated as a joint venture andlor alter \negos, and will be referred to collectively below as \"Burnett,\" unless a distinction is drawn \nbetween them. \n72.  At all relevant times, the Agents acted as the agents andlor representatives of \nSignal, and were acting within the course and scope of their agency, with the full knowledge, \nconsent, permission, authorization and ratification, either express or implied, of Signal in \nperforming the acts alleged in this complaint. \n73.  At all relevant times, the Agents were involved in a venture with each other to \nrecruit the Indian workers, including the Plaintiffs, and bring them to the United States to work at \nSignal, as memorialized by various oral and written communications and agreements, and were \nacting within the course and scope of that venture and those agreements, with the full \nknowledge, consent, permission, authorization and ratification, either express or implied, of each \nof the other Agents in performing the acts alleged in this complaint. \nSUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS \nIn the Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Signal Contracts with Dewan, Burnett, and Pol to \nBring Temporary Workers to the United States at No Cost to Signal \n74.  The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina presented both an opportunity and a \nchallenge for Signal.  The rebuilding effort offered significant potential for new work fixing \ndamaged oil rigs, ships, and other marine platforms.  At the same time, however, because the \n14 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 18 of 106\nhurricane also destroyed or damaged thousands of homes along the Gulf Coast, including in \nPascagoula, some of Signal's workforce had temporarily left the area. \n75.  In early 2006, Michael Pol approached Signal with a purported solution to its \nproblem.  At a meeting in January or February of 2006, Pol told Signal's Chief Financial Officer \nChris Cunningham, Senior Vice President and General Manager Ronald Schnoor, and Vice \nPresident of Productions for Mississippi Operations Bill Bingle, that he could deliver first-class \nfitters and welders from India at no cost to Signal.  Pol informed Signal that he would work with \nlocal immigration attorney Burnett and India-based recruiter Dewan to bring skilled welders \nfrom India.  The workers themselves would pay for all costs and fees associated with the \nrecruitment process, immigration processing, and travel to the United States, and Signal would \nnot reimburse the workers for these fees.  Signal would pay the workers between $14 and $18 \nper hour, depending upon skill level. \n76.  On April 18,2006, Signal executed a document entitled \"Skilled Worker \nRecruitment Agreement\" (the \"Recruitment Agreement\") with Pol's company, Global, \nauthorizing Global to recruit foreign skilled workers for employment at Signal \"under the 'H-2B' \ntemporary program andlor the 'permanent residence' process.\"  Pursuant to the Recruitment \nAgreement, Global would be responsible for all costs associated with recruitment, transportation, \nand entry of the foreign workers into the United States and would deliver the workers \"at no cost \nto Signal\" to the airport of Signal's choice.  The cost incurred by Pol would be deducted directly \nfrom the foreign workers' wages and paid to Pol/Global. \n77.  On June 19,2006, Signal executed a power of attorney with Dewan's company, \nDewan Consultants, appointing Dewan Consultants as Signal's \"representative in India to \nfacilitate the recruitment of skilled workers to the United States of America\" for employment at \n15 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 19 of 106\nSignal.  The power of attorney authorized Dewan Consultants to advertise, conduct seminars and \ntrade tests, and sign any necessary legal documentation on Signal's behalf. \n78.  Also in mid-2006, Signal entered into an attorney-client relationship with Burnett \nto advise Signal on immigration issues pertaining to Signal's need for workers.  Signal and \nBurnett later memorialized their engagement in a written retainer agreement.  Pursuant to that \nagreement, Signal would not be responsible for any of Burnett's legal fees.  Rather, under the \nterms ofthe agreement, Burnett took funds from the \"recruitment fees\" charged to the workers to \npay for the legal services he provided to Signal. \nDefendants File Petitions for Temporary H-2B Visas, Not Green Cards \n79.  Signal requested that the Agents secure foreign workers and transport them to the \nUnited States as quickly as possible.  Signal and the Agents decided that Signal would sponsor \nworkers on an H-2B visa, which could later be extended if Signal needed more foreign labor. \n80.  In 2006, Dewan and Burnett placed newspaper advertisements in at least six \nIndian cities to recruit workers for Signal.  Some of the advertisements offered welders and \nfitters opportunities to go to the United States and obtain H-2B visas or green cards.  Other \nadvertisements touted the opportunity for \"permanent lifetime settlement in U.S.A. for self and \nfamily.\" \n81.  In the spring, surnmer, and fall of 2006, Dewan, Pol, and Burnett traveled \nmultiple times to India and the United Arab Emirates to conduct recruitment seminars with \ninterested potential workers.  At these various seminars, the Agents promised recruits, including \nPlaintiffs, that Signal would sponsor green card applications for them.  In their seminar \npresentations, the Agents promised that although all hopeful green card applicants would \nautomatically be emolled as H-2B candidates, this would not affect the employment based green \ncard process. \n16 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 20 of 106\n82.  Signal and its Agents told the Plaintiffs that Signal would sponsor them \nimmediately for green cards in order to induce them to pay large fees to travel to the United \nStates-which had the net effect of defraying nearly all the costs Signal would have had to \nexpend to recruit workers legitimately-and to induce them to pay exorbitant \"recruitment fees\" \nfar in excess of what would actually be required by the Defendants to obtain H-2B visas or even \nthe promised green cards. \n83.  Unbeknownst to the Plaintiffs, however, Defendants did not take any steps to \napply for permanent residence for the Plaintiffs.  Defendants only helped Plaintiffs obtain \ntemporary, H-2B visas.  Indeed, Signal made clear in its application to the United States \nDepartment of Homeland Security that its need for workers was temporary and short-lived. \n84.  Written agreements between Plaintiffs and the Agents also explicitly promised \nassistance in applying for and securing green cards-assistance that Defendants took no steps \ntoward providing.  Dewan Consultants had the workers, including Plaintiffs, sign \"memoranda of \nunderstanding,\" which, among other things, informed the workers that \"Signal International, \nLLC has orally promised the Facilitator [Dewan Consultants] ... that ... [Signal] will be willing \nto file and process their employment base [sic.] Green Card.\"  Dewan Consultants also issued \nform letters to the workers once they were selected to travel to Signal, informing the workers that \nSignal \"shall proceed with your Green Card for United States of America.\" \n85.  Several Signal employees, including Signal Special Projects Manager John \nSanders and Vice-President of Productions for Mississippi Operations William Bingle, traveled \nto India and attended these sessions.  Sanders also oversaw the immigration interviews and \nserved as contact between Signal and consular officials. \n17 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 21 of 106\n86.  To ensure that their deception remained hidden, Defendants instructed Plaintiffs \nnot to tell United States Department of Homeland Security officials during their forthcoming H-\n2B visa interviews that, in addition to applying for temporary worker status, Signal had promised \nthem that it would sponsor them for green cards.  As Pol explained to Sanders in an August 24, \n2006 email: \nMal[vern Burnett], Sachin [Dewan] or I[] needs to be with each \nand every candidate going into the consulates before their \ninterview [because] [t]hey sometimes say the dumbest things and \nneed to be coached on the proper way to interview.  . .. [T]here are \nsome things that should not be known to the consulate personnel, \nsuch as the fact that we are going to process them for a green card. \nIf one of those guys says he is going to the U.S. for immigration \nand Signal is sponsoring him for permanent residence (green card) \n... he is a goner. \nPlaintiffs Incur Substantial Debt to Afford High \"Recruitment Fees\" \n87.  Lured by the Agents' promises of high-paying employment and permanent \nresidency in the United States, Plaintiffs relinquished stable employment opportunities in India \nand as guest workers in the Persian Gulf. \n88.  Apart from foregoing additional financial gains, Plaintiffs also sold personal and \nfamilial assets and incurred substantial debt to afford the fees demanded by Defendants for their \nrecruitment and travel to the United States. \n89.  These fees, quoted in various amounts to Plaintiffs, ranged from the equivalent of \napproximately $10,000 to $25,000. \n90.  The Agents knew that these fees would cause the workers, including Plaintiffs, to \nincur substantial and potentially ruinous debt. \n91.  Each Plaintiff paid the amounts Defendants requested, as detailed in further \nallegations below. \n18 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 22 of 106\n92.  Before receiving their visas, Plaintiffs were interviewed by officials at the U.S. \nconsulate in India.  Prior to these interviews, Dewan and other employees of Dewan Consultants \nmet with Plaintiffs, took their passports, and, at the direction of Burnett, instructed them to tell \nconsular officials that they only paid a total of approximately $670 in recruiting and immigration \nprocessing fees. \n93.  Dewan told Plaintiffs that if they told the truth about the significant fees they had \npaid, their visas would be cancelled and the Agents would keep the money they had already \ncollected. \n94.  Even in the face of significant delays in processing immigration paperwork, \nwhich left the Plaintiffs jobless and uncertain of their future, Dewan, Pol, and Burnett refused to \nrefund any fees for any reason.  When certain Plaintiffs, including Shaiju Vadakkal George and \nAby Molathu Poulose, expressed reluctance to continue with the immigration process or pay the \nnext fee installment, Dewan, Pol, and Burnett threatened forfeiture of all money paid to that \npoint.  Defendants also loaded new, unexplained fees onto the workers, from minor fees (such as \n$45 \"testing fees\") to significant additional last-minute travel expenses. \n95.  In the hours before their flights to the United States departed, Plaintiffs were \nrequired to wait in line to proceed through Dewan Consultants' cramped offices to make a final \ninstallment payment in cash.  Dewan then forced Plaintiffs to sign various documents - many \nwritten in English, which certain of the Plaintiffs could not read or understand - in a rushed \nfashion.  Dewan even refused to tell Plaintiffs what it was they were signing.  Only then did \nDewan return Plaintiffs' passports to them. \n19 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 23 of 106\n96.  Thereafter, each Plaintiff boarded a flight to the United States, where they were \npicked up from the airport by Signal personnel and taken to Signal's Pascagoula, Mississippi \nfacility. \nPlaintiffs Arrive in Signal's Pascagoula, Mississippi Man Camp and are Subjected to \nDegrading and Discriminatory Conditions \n97.  Signal assigned each Plaintiff to work at its Pascagoula, Mississippi fabrication \nfacility. \n98.  Signal required that each Plaintiff live in a man camp constructed in the fall of \n2006 specifically to house Indian workers.  Signal employees and management referred to the \nPascagoula man camp as \"the Reservation.\" \n99.  Signal personnel discussed among themselves, including in written email \ncommunication, that housing the workers in a secluded man camp on the outskirts of town was \npreferable, as it would keep the Indians segregated from the rest of the Pascagoula, Mississippi \ncommunity. \nI 00.  The Pascagoula man camp was isolated, over-crowded, unsanitary, and not \nsuitable for human habitation.  Workers were not permitted to photograph the man camp. \nOvercrowded Bunkhouses \n101.  The camp bunkhouses themselves were not fit for long-term human habitation. \nSignal crammed up to twenty-four men into each bunkhouse.  The bunk beds were so tightly \npacked that it was difficult for the Plaintiffs to move between them.  The top bunks were so close \nto the ceiling and the bottom bunks so close to the top bunks that Plaintiffs could barely sit up in \ntheir beds. \n20 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 24 of 106\n102.  The bunkhouses had insufficient toilet and showering facilities.  Lines for the \nbathroom were consistently very long.  The showers themselves were dangerous.  Electrical \nconduit joints near the showers were unglued, exposing workers to potential electrocution. \n103.  Privacy was impossible, and sleep was difficult, due to the noise from such close \nquarters, oppressive smells, and the comings and goings of workers who worked on different \nshifts.  Some workers reported rats in their sleeping areas.  Occasionally, rats ran across their \nbodies. \n104.  These conditions fell far short of basic requirements of habitability.  For example, \nthe federal government's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") guidelines \nstate that bunkhouses of similar purpose should have a minimum of 50 square feet of floor space \nper habitant.  Signal's bunkhouses offered less than 18 square feet of floor space per worker. \nLikewise, OSHA guidelines require bunk beds to be at least 48 inches apart from other beds. \nSignal's bunk beds were so tightly packed together that workers were essentially sleeping next to \neach other. \n105.  Workers told Signal personnel on numerous occasions that they found these \nconditions to be intolerable.  Internal communications among Signal personnel discussed the \n\"overcrowding,\" acknowledging that the Pascagoula camp was at least \"3 bunk-houses\" shy of \nappropriate capacity, and that \"more toilet/sink capacity\" was needed. \nRotten Food \n106.  The food provided by Signal was deplorable.  Meals were offered exclusively in a \nmess hall, which was only open during limited hours.  Workers who showed up a few minutes \nlate for a meal were denied food altogether.  Those who did eat were often served rotten food \nand, at times, workers found bugs in their meals. \n21 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 25 of 106\n107.  Workers frequently complained to Signal personnel that the food was so bad that \nthey were left hungry.  Others complained to Signal that the food was making them physically \nill. \n108.  In an email to other Signal personnel, Signal Senior Vice-President & General \nManager Ron Schnoor acknowledged the \"bad, stale, molded, and otherwise poor quality food.\" \nRampant Disease \n109.  Even apart from the kitchen conditions, the man camp itself was a breeding \nground for bacteria and disease. \n110.  Workers frequently became severely ill.  As explained by the Signal's manager of \nthe Pascagoula man camp: \nOur Indians  have  been  dropping  with sickness  like  flies. \n1 \n[They  are  getting  worried  and  believe  there  are  unhealthful \nconditions  in the  camp.  It  is  true.  The  reason  is  because the \nplumbing was so shoddily done by GE's subcontractors, and water \nhas leaked everywhere and stagnated as a result, which serves as a \nbacterial breeding ground. \nPerpetual and Abusive Oversight \nIll.  Signal instilled in Plaintiffs a climate of fear through perpetual and invasive \noversight and surveillance. \n112.  The Pascagoula man camp was located in an isolated industrial area that was \nmiles removed from other residential communities, shopping facilities, worship houses, and \nother basic amenities.  The man camp was enclosed by fences and accessible only by a single \nentrance, which was guarded by an armed security guard at all times.  When returning \"home\" \nfrom work and entering the camp, Plaintiffs were required to show identification and subject \nthemselves and their belongings to search.  Their movements into and out of the camp were \nlogged. \n22 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 26 of 106\n113.  Guests were not normally permitted in the man camp; Plaintiffs were permitted \nvisitors in the parking lot. \n114.  Because the camp was isolated, Plaintiffs relied upon transportation from Signal \nto and from work and also to other populated areas.  However, Signal would only take them to \nWal-Mart or the bank.  Even then, Plaintiffs had little privacy as Signal security would \noccasionally follow them into Wal-Mart. \n115.  Signal's private security forces entered the Plaintiffs' bunk area at night.  Signal \npersonnel and camp security guards conducted \"surprise searches\" of the bunkhouses, including \nsearches of workers' personal belongings. \n116.  Plaintiffs were not told when these searches would be conducted (again, in what \nwas supposed to be Plaintiffs' \"home\"), nor were they apprised of what it was Signal was \nlooking for. \n117.  Signal prohibited Plaintiffs from drinking alcohol at the camp.  Violation \nsubjected the workers to fines of $250 and suspension from work.  A second \"offense\" would \nresult in a $500 fine; a third \"offense,\" $750. \n118.  The prohibition of alcohol was modeled after Signal's policies for conduct in the \nworkplace despite the fact that the workers were living, not working, in the man camp. \n119.  Signal did not bar its non-Indian workers from having visitors or drinking alcohol \nin their homes.  Nor did Signal confine its non-Indian workers to crowded bunkhouses or subject \nthem to invasive searches of their homes or belongings and near-constant surveillance. \nSignal Charged Plaintiffs Approximately $1050 Each Month to Live in These Conditions \n120.  For the \"privilege\" of living in these conditions, the Indian workers (including \neach Plaintiff) were charged $35 dollars per day (approximately $1,050 per month).  From this \n23 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 27 of 106\namount, $21 was allocated towards rent and $14 towards food.  The $35 daily fee was deducted \nautomatically from the Plaintiffs' paychecks. \n121.  Pol personally received $1.50 per day per worker from the $14 food cost in pure \nprofit for having referred a caterer, Laxmi Catering, to Signal.  When Pol was later terminated by \nSignal, the $1.50 per worker per day profit was not remitted to the workers but was instead paid \nto another caterer, Anjay Keswani. \n122.  Before the $35 per day value was set, Signal's Senior Vice President and General \nManager Ronald Schnoor initially recommended that Signal charge the workers $53.50 per day. \nSchnoor reached that figure by calculating the amount it would take to amortize over just ten \nmonths the entire cost Signal incurred building the man camps in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and \nOrange, Texas-a $7 million capital expenditure.  Schnoor shockingly dismissed the devastating \nimpact of this exorbitant $1,600 per month fee by cavalierly asserting the Plaintiffs and their \nfellow workers would all be \"happy campers\" because Signal's living arrangements and wages \nwere likely to be an improvement over conditions in India. \n123.  After a short time in the camp, workers (including certain Plaintiffs) began \ncomplaining about the poor conditions and asked to live outside the camp in accommodations of \ntheir own choosing.  In response, Signal informed Plaintiffs that if they tried to live outside the \ncamps, Signal would continue to deduct $35 per day from their paychecks.  Given their \nsubstantial debts, this wage deduction left Plaintiffs with no choice but to remain at the camp. \n124.  Signal did not require any non-Indian workers to pay for Signal's capital \nexpenditures, nor did it require any other workers to pay for living expenses, whether or not they \nwere living in Signal-provided housing. \n24 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 28 of 106\n125.  Signal imposed this onerous policy in order to avoid paying any of its own \nexpenses.  By exploiting the Plaintiffs' tenuous financial position, heavy debt load, precarious \nimmigration situation and fear of job loss, Signal knew that they and their coworkers would have \nno choice but to continue working at the company.  Indeed, because of the grip in which Signal \nheld its Indian workers, the Plaintiffs felt compelled to remain at the Pascagoula man camp. \n126.  In contrast, workers of non-Indian race, ethnicity, or alienage were not required, \nor even allowed, to live in and/or pay for housing in the Pascagoula man camp. \nPlaintiffs Experienced Other Discrimination by Signal and its Employees \nDue to their Race, Ethnicity, Religion, and Alienage \n127.  Defendants' racial animus and discrimination against Plaintiffs and the other \nIndian workers took other, equally abusive, forms. \n128.  Whether on \"the Reservation\" or at the worksite, Plaintiffs repeatedly heard \nSignal employees, including supervisors, use offensive and racist language in speaking or \nreferring to Plaintiffs and the other Indian workers. \n129.  Management frequently referred to Indian workers by badge number, instead of \nattempting to pronounce their names. \n130.  In an April 5, 2007 email to Signal employees Bill Bingle and Tracey Binion, \nSignal employee Darrell Snyder stated his opinion that it was a \"misguided notion that some of \nthese Indians can be reasoned with,\" and discussed his plan to engage in a \"rat hunt\" in the \nPascagoula camp to determine who was causing \"dissension\" among the workers. \n131.  Signal also displayed a shocking lack of respect for Plaintiffs' religious beliefs. \n132.  Signal knew that many of the workers were highly religious.  In particular, Signal \nknew that certain of its workers were Sikh. \n25 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 29 of 106\n133.  Wearing a beard is an article offaith in Sikhism.  In the Sikh tradition, a beard \ndemonstrates a love of God and respect for the natural form God bestows on man. \n134.  Signal nevertheless demanded that Sikh workers shave their beards after arriving \nat the Pascagoula camp and threatened to deport them if they would not do so.  When Plaintiff \nRanjit Singh and other Sikhs were forced to shave their beards, they sat on the floor and cried, \ndistraught.  Workers of non-Indian race, ethnicity, or alienage and not of the Sikh religion were \nnot subject to similar conditions of employment. \n135.  Signal also required Plaintiffs to engage in repeated \"skills testing\" evaluations \nthat non-Indian workers were not required to take and subjected Plaintiffs to on-the-job \ndiscipline, periods without work, and unfavorable job assignments to which workers of non \nIndian race, ethnicity, or alienage were not subjected. \n136.  Signal also forced Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, to work under conditions \nthat were harder and more dangerous than the jobs Signal assigned to non-Indian workers.  For \ninstance, some worked in small, smoke-filled tanks that lacked ventilation, while non-Indian \nworkers were not required to do the same.  Plaintiff Jolmy Mathew fell from a scaffold and \nsuffered chest pains, but Signal would not send him to a doctor or allow him to receive a medical \nexam. \n137.  When workers complained about these unsafe and illegal conditions, Signal \ndemoted them, suspended them without pay, andlor threatened to deport them.  Plaintiff \nParshottam Mangani was demoted after complaining about slippery floors at his worksite, while \nother Indian workers who complained about unsafe conditions were suspended for three days for \n\"safety violations.\"  Workers of non-Indian race, ethnicity, or alienage were not treated this \nway. \n26 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 30 of 106\n138.  Defendants' discriminatory treatment of Plaintiffs and other Indian workers was \nmotivated by racial, ethnic, and religious animus, as well as an animus against those ofIndian \nnational origin. \nSignal and the Agents Continued to Mislead the Plaintiffs \nAbout the Terms of their Employment \n139.  On numerous occasions during October, November, and December 2006, Burnett \nand Signal personnel met with workers who asked about the prospect of receiving green cards. \nDuring these meetings, Signal personnel were told by workers that the Agents and Signal \npersonnel in India had promised that Signal would apply for and help the workers obtain green \ncards, and that the workers had paid as much as $25,000 for that opportunity. \n140.  Rather than tell the workers honestly that Signal had not applied for permanent \nresidency on their behalf and had no present intention to do so, Signal continued to deceive the \nworkers into believing that Signal would apply for and help them obtain permanent residency \nstatus.  Notably, in or about January 2007, Dewan and Burnett traveled to the man camp and, \nwith Signal employee John Sanders present, told Plaintiffs and other Indian workers that Signal \nwould provide each Indian worker, including Plaintiffs, with a green card. \n141.  Beginning before this meeting and continuing throughout 2007, Signal employees \ncommunicated and consulted with each other and with the Agents concerning what to tell \nworkers, including Plaintiffs, about the status of their visas and green card applications. \n142.  Signal also did nothing to address the fact that the Plaintiffs' temporary \nemployment at Signal (which Signal itself represented to the U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity, under penalty of perjury, would be completed \"within the ...y ear\") was not \neconomically justifiable in light of the crushing amounts of debt Plaintiffs incurred and the \nmandatory $35 per day deduction for room and board. \n27 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 31 of 106\n143.  By at least October 2006, shortly after the first workers (including Plaintiffs) \narrived in Pascagoula, Signal personnel learned that each worker had been required to pay well \nover the equivalent of $1 0,000 to Pol, Burnett, and Dewan. \n144.  In internal correspondence and conversation, Signal personnel (including Signal \nexecutives) concluded that these \"recruitment fees\" were excessive and a root cause of \ndissatisfaction and low morale among the Indian workers. \n145.  Nevertheless, Signal did effectively nothing to remedy the situation. \n146.  First, although Signal sent a letter to Dewan and Burnett requesting that they \nrefund half of the fees that they had received, Signal did not terminate its relationship with \nDewan or Burnett or impose any penalty or withhold any payment when those individuals \nrefused to comply.  In fact, Signal did nothing even after Burnett (i) asserted to Signal that \nDewan had refunded the workers' money, and (ii) furnished affidavits signed by workers \nattesting to the \"fact\" that they never paid any fees, both claims that Signal itself considered \nplainly false. \n147.  Second, despite believing that the fees being charged were unreasonable and were \ngenerating problems, Signal never demanded that Dewan or Burnett cease collecting such fees \nfrom new recruits who were still in India.  Indeed, Signal continued to hire workers, including \ncertain Plaintiffs, through Dewan and Burnett after it learned of the unreasonable fees that they \ncharged, effectively ratifying the conduct of its Agents. \n148.  Third, Signal did not itself refund the unreasonable fees charged by the Agents, \nnor did Signal offer any assistance to mitigate the cost or modify its contract with the Agents in \nwhich it had been agreed that neither Signal nor Global would shoulder any of the \"recruitment \nfees\" for its Indian workers. \n28 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 32 of 106\nIn an Attempt to Quell Rising Worker Dissatisfaction, Signal Sends Three Workers \nBack to India, One of Whom Attempts Suicide \n149.  By the spring of2007 (approximately 3-4 months after workers first arrived), it \nbecame increasingly clear that the conditions at the Pascagoula camp were intolerable.  Workers \nbegan to consider ways to convince Signal to improve the conditions and sought outside advice \nfrom local church goers and attorneys. \n150.  In late February 2007, when Signal learned that certain workers had contacted a \nlawyer, Signal threatened to send the most vocal workers back to India. \n151.  Similarly, Dewan called one vocal worker's wife in India and warned her to tell \nher husband to stop making trouble at Signal. \n152.  News of Dewan's call to India spread among the workers, and substantially \nheightened Plaintiffs' fears that Defendants would retaliate, perhaps even with violence, against \nthem and their families if they complained about or tried to leave the discriminatory and \ndegrading conditions. \n153.  Signal escalated its pressure on the workers.  In a meeting with the workers, \nincluding Plaintiffs, on March 8, 2007, Signal management told them that Signal would fight \nback against any \"organizing\" efforts, and that Signal would not extend any ofthe workers' H-\n2B visas if a single worker took legal action against Signal. \n154.  On that same day, Signal decided to terminate and forcibly send back to India five \nof the ostensible \"camp leaders,\" and to do so in a way that would make an example out of them \nand intimidate the other workers into remaining scared and compliant. \n155.  Early in the morning of March 9, 2007-when the workers for both the day and \nnight shifts were present at the carnp-Signallocked the gate to the Pascagoula man camp, \nthereby blocking the only exit.  At approximately the same time, Signal camp coordinator Darrell \n29 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 33 of 106\nSnyder and five security guards swept through the bunkhouses carrying pictures of the men \ntargeted for termination.  Because Mr. Snyder and the security guards could not differentiate the \nappearance of these Indian men, they accosted numerous workers to determine whether they \nwere the individuals shown in the pictures. \n156.  By 6:00 a.m., Signal had identified the five workers, taken them into \"custody\" in \na side room, and told them that they were fired and would be deported.  Distraught at what that \nmeant for him and his family, one of the workers slashed his wrists and attempted suicide in \nfront of Plaintiff Parshottam Mangani. \n157.  By early afternoon, local media, religious advocates, and other individuals had \ngathered outside the camp gates to express their concern over the attempted suicide and the \nforced detention of the other men. \n158.  The incidents of March 9, 2007 caused great fear in each of the Plaintiffs.  Not \nonly were they afraid ofthe worsening tension among the workers, they were scared of what \nSignal would do to them if they raised concerns about conditions at the camp.  Plaintiffs \nbelieved, based on Signal's conduct, that protesting their plight would lead to arrest, \nimprisonment, bodily harm, and deportation back to India. \n159.  Indeed, by its conduct over March 8 and 9, 2007, Signal intentionally created a \nclimate offear and intimidation in order to overawe the Plaintiffs and their coworkers into \ndropping their complaints about the camp and their treatment at the hands of Signal and its \nAgents. \nSignal, Assisted by Burnett and Dewan, Used Fraudulent and Coercive Tactics to \nKeep Plaintiffs in the Pascagoula Camp \n160.  Following the March 9, 2007 incident, Signal used additional fraudulent and \ncoercive tactics to keep the workers, including Plaintiffs, under its control. \n30 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 34 of 106\n161.  Later that month, Signal Senior Vice President Ron Schnoor addressed the entire \nPascagoula man camp about what had happened on March 9. \n162.  Schnoor used two tactics:  fraudulent promises of long-term employment, and \nthreats to send the workers back to India. \n163.  First, Schnoor assured the men that Signal would continue to employ them for the \n\"long term.\" That assurance was demonstrably false at the time, given that Signal still had not \ndecided whether it would extend any of the workers beyond the initial ten-month visa period, and \ngiven that Signal had already begun to evaluate the Pascagoula workers and had decided to fire \nand not apply for visa extensions for certain workers. \n164.  Second, Schnoor threatened the men, telling them that if anyone Indian worker \nfiled a lawsuit against Signal, Signal would refuse to extend any of the H-2B visas for any of the \nworkers, and would therefore send all of them back to India.  Signal knew full well that this \nthreat would coerce the workers, including Plaintiffs, into staying at the camp, lest they return to \nIndia in crushing debt. \n165.  Nevertheless, even given the threats and false promises, by March 2008, over \nthree-quarters of the Indian workers in the Pascagoula camp had escaped from Signal.  Many \nwere terminated; others left of their own accord due to the low pay, abusive treatment, and \ndeplorable living conditions. \n166.  No Plaintiff received a green card.  Indeed, neither Signal nor the Agents ever \napplied for a green card for any Plaintiff. \nMalvern Burnett Purported to Act as Attorney to Plaintiffs, but In Reality Was Working Solely \non Behalf of Defendants \n31 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 35 of 106\n167.  At all relevant times, Burnett had an attorney-client relationship with each \nPlaintiff and, indeed, each Indian worker employed by Signal, for purposes of immigration issues \nand each Plaintiffs' work for Signal. \n168.  Burnett prepared the immigration forms required for Plaintiffs to apply for H-2B \nstatus.  In completing those forms, Burnett represented to the U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity, under penalty of perjury, that the Plaintiffs would stay in the United States only \ntemporarily, returning to India \"within the coming year.\"  At the same time Burnett was \nsubmitting those forms, he was affumatively telling the workers, including Plaintiffs, that they \nwould be eligible for permanent residency, and that he would assist them in applying for green \ncards. \n169.  Further, Burnett learned that, after they arrived in the United States, the workers, \nincluding Plaintiffs, asked Signal personnel when they could expect to receive green cards. \nAfter learning this, Burnett did nothing to correct his clients' misimpression. \n170.  To further his deception, Burnett concealed from Plaintiffs where his true \nloyalties lay.  As noted above, by mid-2006 Burnett had entered into an attorney-client \nrelationship with Signal for the broad purpose of applying for and obtaining lawful status for \nIndian workers to come to the United States.  Later, in 2007, Signal and Burnett entered into a \nwritten Retainer Agreement memorializing the arrangement as it had been operating-namely \nthat Burnett would \"represent you [Signal] in the matter of H-2B Visa extensions for MS and \nTX\" on immigration matters at zero cost while the fees for his work on behalf of Signal were to \nbe taken from the Indian workers, including Plaintiffs. \n32 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 36 of 106\n171.  Burnett never disclosed his attorney-client relationship or payment arrangement \nwith Signal to the Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, much less received their waiver of the \nconflict of interest it caused. \n172.  Burnett also entered into an attorney-client relationship with Dewan and Pol, \nstarting no later than mid-2006.  Burnett never disclosed this attorney-client relationship with Pol \nand Dewan to the Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, much less received their approval for it. \n173.  Burnett also had a \"Multilateral Business Agreement\" with Dewan and Pol, for \nthe broad purpose ofrecruiting Indian workers to come to the United States.  Burnett never \ndisclosed this \"Multilateral Business Agreement\" to the Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, \nmuch less received their approval for it. \n174.  One incident in particular crystalizes the contempt with which Burnett viewed his \nIndian clients.  On December 16, 2006, Burnett sent an email to Dewan and Pol regarding Pravin \nKumar N. Patel, a Signal worker and client of Burnett.  Patel had stopped payment on a check to \nBurnett.  Burnett told Dewan and Pol to ensure that \"the idiot\" Patel restore the payment and \nthreatened to have Patel's visa \"mysteriously\" revoked if Patel did not pay. Later in the email, \nBurnett referred to all the Indian workers, who were his clients, as \"the idiots\" and speculated \nabout whether he should threaten them with \"immediate deportation\" in order to prevent them \nfrom stopping payment on future checks. \n175.  Burnett also forwarded emails he received from his Indian worker clients to \nDewan.  Burnett forwarded these attorney-client protected communications without permission \nfrom his clients, the workers. \n176.  Such appalling behavior violates not only the Mississippi Rules of Professional \nConduct for attorneys, but basic notions of loyalty, propriety, and honesty. \n33 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 37 of 106\nPlaintiffs Each Relied on the Defendants' Representations \nLakshmanan Ponnayan Achari \n177.  In or about the last week of April 2006, Achari was working as a fitter in Chennai, \nIndia.  A boy from Achari's hometown in Southern India called Achari and said that he had seen \nnewspaper advertisements offering the opportunity to live in the United States and obtain a green \ncard.  Achari subscribed to one of those newspapers so he looked at the advertisement and \nconfirmed that it promised the opportunity to get a green card. \n178.  Achari then spoke with a friend, who had been working with Dewan Consultants. \nThe friend knew the personal phone number of a man named Salimon and called Salimon on \nbehalf of Achari.  Salimon said that Achari should come to an interview. \n179.  In or about May of2006, Achari traveled with a friend to the friend's interview \nwith Dewan Consultants.  Achari spoke directly with Salimon, who told Achari that there were \njob openings for fitters in the United States.  Achari told Salimon that he did not have a passport, \nbut Salimon assured him that this would not be a problem. \n180.  On Salimon's recommendation, Achari took a written test for the fitter job. \nSalimon, Dewan, Pol, and, on information and belief, Signal employees were present for the test. \nPol reviewed the test results and informed Achari that he passed.  Dewan also reviewed the test \nresults and made notations on Achari's testing paperwork. \n181.  About two days later, Achari attended a group interview.  At that interview, \nSalimon explained that Achari could obtain a green card.  Salim on also told Achari that this \nprocess would cost 600,000 rupees (approximately $11,000).1 \nUnless otherwise specified, all U.S. dollar approximations are determined through the use \nof a historical exchange rate calculator, available at \nhttp://www.oanda.com/convert/fxhistory. \n34 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 38 of 106\n182.  Achari paid this amount to Salimon, Dewan, Burnett, and Pol in three installments \nin or about and between June and December of2006.  To raise this money, Achari sold his \nwife's jewelry.  He also incurred substantial debt; he obtained two loans, each at a 36 percent \ninterest rate. \n183.  In or about November of 2006, Achari met with Dewan and, on information an] \nbelief, a Signal employee.  Achari told Dewan that he had recently heard from other workers mat \nthey were receiving H-2B visas and that this was the first time Achari heard that he might \nreceive anything besides a green card.  Dewan assured Achari that Achari had paid for and \nwould receive a green card. \n184.  Also in or about November of 2006, Achari again met with Salimon.  Salimon \nassured Achari that he would receive a green card within eight months. \n185.  On the day he was scheduled to fly to the United States, Achari traveled to \nDewan's office in India to obtain his passport.  Although Achari arrived in the morning, DeViID \ndid not meet with him until the evening - just two hours before his flight was scheduled to \ndepart.  Dewan demanded that Achari sign blank pieces of paper and pay the final installment of \nhis \"recruitment fees\" before Dewan would give him his passport.  Achari felt intimidated and \nthat he had no choice but to comply.  He signed and left for the airport. \n186.  After arriving in the United States, Achari felt compelled to remain at Signal's \nman camp and work for Signal because, among other reasons, Signal would deduct living \nexpenses from his paycheck even if he lived elsewhere.  Defendants also continued to assure \nAchari that he would receive a green card.  For instance, shortly after he arrived in Pascagoula, \nAchari met with Burnett and Snyder.  At that meeting, Burnett assured Achari that he had \n35 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 39 of 106\napplied for H-2B visa extensions for him.  Achari also met with Pol, Burnett, and Snyder.  At \nthat meeting, Burnett told that Achari that his green card would be processed. \n187.  Achari relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, Achari \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nKodakeril Baby Biji \n188.  In or about July 2006, Biji saw a newspaper advertisement offering the chance to \nobtain an H-2B visa and then permanent residency in the United States.  In response, he called \nDewan Consultants, and Salimon told Biji that he should attend an interview that would take \nplace about one month later. \n189.  Salimon, Dewan, and two Signal employees were present at Biji's initial \ninterview.  The Signal employees gave Biji a written test, and Salimon explained that Biji and \nthe other attendees would obtain a ten month H-2B visa and then a green card.  Salimon also \nexplained that this process would cost over 600,000 rupees (approximately $12,500).  This \nmoney would be paid to Dewan Consultants, Pol, and Burnett. \n190.  Biji paid the fees demanded by the Agents.  To raise the money, he used his \nsavings and borrowed from a bank at an interest rate of approximately 10 to 13 percent annually. \nBiji borrowed other funds at a 20 percent annual interest rate. \n191.  Approximately one or two months after his initial interview, Biji brought a fee \ninstallment to Dewan and Burnett at a hotel in India.  Burnett told Biji that he would receive a \n36 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 40 of 106\nvisa and gave Biji paperwork promising an H-2B visa and permanent residency.  Then, on or \nabout November 7, 2006, Biji met again with Salimon, who stated that Biji would travel to the \nUnited States for ten months on an H-2B visa, return to India, and then come back to the United \nStates with a green card. \n192.  Just before Biji left India, Dewan forced him to sign paperwork written in \nEnglish.  Because Biji did not speak or read English, he could not understand what the \npaperwork said. \n193.  After arriving in the United States in or about December 2006, Biji met with \nBurnett and Sanders at the Pascagoula camp.  Biji asked both Burnett and Sanders when he \nwould receive his green card.  Both assured him that Signal would file for his green card. \n194.  Biji relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good working \nconditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work for Signal \nin the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by Signal, his \nneed to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \"recruitment \nfees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, and his fear that \nSignal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, Biji felt intimidated into \nacquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nXavier Disoliyan \n195.  In or about June 2006, Disoliyan was working as a welder in Abu Dhabi and saw \nan advertisement in a local newspaper promising an opportunity to work for a \"leading\" United \nStates marine company that would provide work visas and permanent residency.  In or about July \n2006, Disoliyan attended a walk-in skills test in India, at which Dewan, Salimon, and Signal \nrepresentatives were present.  At the skills test, Dewan and Salimon told Disoliyan and other \nworkers that they would travel to the United States on H-2B visas.  Dewan and Salimon also said \n37 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 41 of 106\nthat, after six months, the workers would receive green cards and would be able to bring their \nfamilies to the United States. \n196.  Dewan and his agents told Disoliyan and others that they would need to pay over \n700,000 rupees (approximately $14,436) for this opportunity.  DisoJiyan spoke privately with \nDewan and Salimon and told them that he did not have enough money.  Dewan and Salimon \nexplained that Disoliyan could pay in installments, and he should take advantage of the \nopportunity because the job in the United Sates would allow him to save 150,000 rupees \n(approximately $3,000) every month.  Based on Dewan's and Salimon's assurances, Disoliyan \nbelieved that he would be able to pay back any loans in as few as six months. \n197.  Disoliyan paid the fees demanded by Dewan, Pol, and Burnett by using family \nproperty as collateral for loans.  He secured a loan for approximately 300,000 rupees by posting \nthe house that he had built and the property he had received as part of his wife's dowry as \ncollateral.  Disoliyan borrowed the remaining 400,000 rupees (approximately $8,200) through a \nloan against which his brother-in-law offered his own house as collateral.  Pursuant to the terms \nof this loan, Disoliyan was required to begin repaying the principal within one month, and a \ndefault would mean foreclosure on his brother-in-Iaw's home. \n198.  In or about August 2006, Disoliyan met with Dewan, Salimon, and Burnett to pay \nfor what Burnett said was his permanent residency visa.  At this meeting, Burnett assured \nDisoliyan that his permanent residency application would be granted. \n199.  In or about November 2006, Disoliyan traveled to Dewan's office in Mumbai to \npay his final fee installment and receive his plane ticket and passport.  It was there that he first \nlearned that Signal would charge him $35 per day for food and accommodations.  Disoliyan was \nupset about this additional cost and concerned that it would make it more difficult for him to \n38 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 42 of 106\nrepay his loans.  Dewan assured Disoliyan he would be able to send 150,000 rupees \n(approximately $3000) back to India each month.  Regardless, Disoliyan decided that he had no \nchoice but to agree because Dewan and his associates told him that if he refused, he would not \nreceive a refund of the fees that he had already paid.  Dewan also pressured Disoliyan to sign \nadditional paperwork without giving him an opportunity to read it because they were in a rush to \nget to the airport. \n200.  Upon arrival in the United States, Disoliyan felt that Signal's work conditions \nwere unsafe.  He did not express those concerns to Signal management, however, because he \nobserved that Signal demoted, fired, suspended, or reduced the pay ofIndian workers who \ncomplained about the conditions.  At times, Disoliyan was unable to send enough money home \nto pay his loans because of the charges Signal deducted from his paycheck. \n201.  Disoliyan relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, Disoliyan \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nRajankunju Geevarghese \n202.  In or about April 2006, Geevarghese saw an advertisement in an Indian \nnewspaper that offered jobs in the United States for pipefitters and welders.  The advertisement \nalso stated that workers would receive work visas and green cards.  Geevarghese called Dewan \nConsultants and was told to attend one of a series of meetings scheduled for early May. \n39 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 43 of 106\n203.  On or about May 2 or 3, 2006, Geevarghese attended a meeting at the Trident \nHotel in Cochin, at which Dewan, Pol, and Salimon were present.  Upon information and belief, \nSignal staff members were also present.  During the meeting, Dewan said that the workers woud \ninitially receive H-2B visas, which would be extended for nine additional months.  At the saml \ntime that the workers were processed for H-2B visas, Signal would also apply for green cards fur \nevery worker.  Dewan also stated that the cost for the entire process would be 700,000 rupees \n(approximately $15,630), which would be paid in three installments to Pol, Burnett, and Dewall. \nAt Dewan's request, Geevarghese and other interested workers signed a \"temporary contract,\" \nwhich documented what was discussed at the meeting, including the fees and the promise of a \nvisa and a green card. \n204.  Approximately three days later, Geevarghese received a call from Salimon, wiJo \ntold him to attend a welding test on or about May 8, 2006.  Geevarghese took two tests \nadministered by two Signal employees.  Salimon then informed him that he had passed and \nshould begin to collect the money needed for his fees. \n205.  Although Dewan had initially told Geevarghese that the process would cost \n700,000 rupees, the Agents ended up demanding even more from Geevarghese, which \nGeevarghese paid.  In order to raise the money necessary to pay the fees, Geevarghese depleted \nhis savings and sold his wife's and his children's jewelry.  In addition, he took out one loan for \n250,000 rupees (approximately $5,582) and another loan for 450,000 rupees (approximately \n$10,102), both at 24 percent annual interest. \n206.  Following his skills tests, Salimon called Geevarghese regularly to provide him \nwith updates concerning the status of his case and to inform him when and where to pay the fee \n40 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 44 of 106\ninstallments.  Geevarghese paid these fee installments to Dewan, Pol, and Burnett in or about \nMay tbrough November 2006. \n207.  On or about November 6, Geevarghese met with Dewan, Salimon, and Sanders, \nwho told him not to mention the fees he had paid to Dewan, Pol, and Burnett during his \ninterview at the United States Consulate. \n208.  On or about November 24, 2006, Salimon arranged for Geevarghese to fly from \nCochin to Mumbai so that he could make his final payment and receive his passport and plane \nticket to the United States.  When Geevarghese met with Dewan that day, Dewan insisted that \nGeevarghese pay an additional 4,000 rupees (approximately $90) for the plane ticket to Mumbai. \nGeevarghese had not been told about this fee and only had 6,000 rupees left for travel expenses. \nDewan, however, refused to give Geevarghese his passport and ticket to the United States until \nhe paid the 4,000 rupees.  Intimidated by Dewan, afraid of being stranded in Mumbai, and fearful \nof losing the opportunity to work in the United States, Geevarghese paid Dewan.  Dewan then \ndemanded that Geevarghese sign several contracts without offering him enough time to review \nthem. \n209.  In the United States, Geevarghese was shocked by the living conditions he was \nforced to endure.  He also learned for the first time that Signal would deduct money from his \npaycheck for the tools he used.  Nonetheless, Geevarghese was afraid to leave his position at \nSignal and return to India; he had sold everything of value that his family owned and knew he \nwould never be able to pay back his enormous debts working in India. \n210.  Geevarghese relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \n41 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 45 of 106\nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, \nGeevarghese felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nJomon George \n211.  In or about April or May 2006, J. George saw an advertisement in an Indian \nnewspaper for pipefitting jobs in the United States.  The advertisement stated that permanent \nresidency status would be available to workers after six to nine months.  1. George called the \nlisted number and spoke with Salimon, who told him about an interview and informational \nseminar.  Salimon and Dewan were present at the seminar, as were two or three men from \nSignal.  Salimon explained that in order to obtain their green cards, the workers would need to \npay Dewan, Pol, and Burnett 600,000 rupees (approximately $13,400). \n212.  J. George later took and passed a qualifying test.  After the test, a Signal \nrepresentative assured 1. George that he would receive permanent residency status ifhe accepted \nthe job with Signal.  J. George then signed an agreement with Signal, which he understood to \npromise him a 10-month H-2B visa that would be extended and then converted into a green card. \n213.  In or about August 2006, 1. George met with Burnett and Dewan, who promised \nhim that the workers would receive green cards that would enable them to live and work \npermanently in the United States. \n214.  George paid the substantial fees demanded by Dewan, Pol, and Burnett in \ninstallments in or about August through November 2006.  In order to raise this money, J. George \ntook out a loan at 18 percent annual interest, using a piece of land that his wife owned as \ncollateral.  He also sold all of his wife'sjeweJry and borrowed money from his brother and \nseveral friends. \n42 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 46 of 106\n215.  Before flying to the United States, 1. George traveled to Dewan's Mumbai office \nto collect his passport and plane ticket and pay his final installment.  1. George asked Dewan if \nhe could get his money back if he did not want to go to the United States, but Dewan told him \n\"no.\" Dewan's agents required J. George to sign various documents, but because the documents \nwere in English and the agents rushed him, J. George did not have an opportunity to read or \nunderstand what he was signing. \n216.  In the United States, J. George and the other Indian workers were told by Sanders \nand other Signal officials that if they caused any trouble, they would be sent back to India.  J. \nGeorge believed that he had no choice but to endure the unsanitary and unsafe conditions \nwithout complaint because Signal controlled his immigration status.  He did not want to \njeopardize his employment with Signal because he needed to earn enough money to payoff the \ndebt he had incurred in order to pay Dewan, Pol, and Burnett. \n217.  J. George relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, J. George \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nShaiju Vadakkal George \n218.  In or about April 2006, S. George had been working as a welder in Oman for nine \nyears when he learned from a friend about an advertisement for welding jobs and permanent \nresidency in the United States.  After calling Dewan Consultants and speaking with Salimon, S. \nGeorge took emergency leave from his job to attend a seminar in India led by Dewan, Salimon, \n43 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 47 of 106\nand Burnett.  At the seminar, Burnett explained that the workers would travel to the United \nStates on H-2B visas, which would be extended twice.  They would then receive green cards and \nbe able to bring their families to the United States permanently.  Dewan explained that green \ncard processing would cost 550,000 rupees (approximately $12,280), and H-2B processing \nwould cost 200,000 rupees (approximately $4,460). \n219.  Approximately one month later, S. George received a call from Salimon, who \nexplained that the fee had been reduced to 600,000 rupees (approximately $13,070).  S. George \nsaid that he wanted to wait for a green card rather than start with an H-2B visa, but Salimon \nconvinced him to start work on just an H-2B visa.  Shortly after this conversation, S. George \ncompleted a skills test administered by Salimon and several Signal employees.  After a Signal \nemployee told George that he passed the test, Salimon instructed S. George to begin collecting \nmoney for his first payment. \n220.  S. George paid the 600,000 rupees demanded by the Agents by borrowing money \nat an interest rate of approximately 5 percent per month.  He secured a second loan using his \nwife's jewelry as collateral.  Just before his consular interview, S. George resigned from his job \nin Oman. \n221.  On or about November 28, 2006, S. George traveled to Dewan's office to pay his \nfinal fee installment and receive his ticket and passport.  Dewan refused to give S. George his \nticket and passport, however, because Dewan claimed that he owed an additional 10,000 rupees. \nS. George knew that ifhe failed to pay the 10,000 rupees, he would forfeit all of the money that \nhe had already paid to Dewan, Pol, and Burnett.  S. George also felt compelled to pay because he \nhad already quit his job in Oman and he could not make enough money in India to repay his \ndebts.  He begged some friends who were also at Dewan's office to help him, and together, they \n44 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 48 of 106\nwere able to raise 10,000 rupees.  After S. George paid his final fees, Dewan would not give him \nhis ticket and passport until he had relinquished all of the receipts and documents that he had \nreceived in connection with his recruitment. \n222.  After S. George arrived in the United States, he attended a meeting at which \nBurnett, Dewan, and a Signal representative all warned the Indian workers not to criticize Signal \nifthey wanted to obtain green cards. \n223.  S. George relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, S. George \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nMouleswararao Guntamukkala \n224.  On or about May 23, 2006, Guntamukkala read a newspaper advertisement placed \nby Dewan Consultants.  The advertisement offered the opportunity to work in the United States \nand obtain a green card.  That same day, Guntamukkala spoke with a representative of Dewan \nConsultants, who told him that he could obtain an H-2B visa, which would be converted to a \ngreen card ifhe worked at Signal for one year. \n225.  Approximately one week later, Guntamukkala attended a small meeting at the \noffice of Dewan Consultants, where Dewan explained the process in similar terms.  Dewan also \nstated that it would cost each worker the equivalent of approximately $20,000.  Shortly after the \nmeeting, Guntamukkala took and passed a welding test, at which Dewan, Pol, and a Signal \n45 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 49 of 106\nemployee were present.  Dewan and Pol gave Guntamukkala a signed statement promising that \nhe would receive a green card if he passed his welding test and worked at Signal. \n226.  In order to raise the money to pay Dewan, Pol, and Burnett, Guntamukkala \nborrowed the equivalent of approximately $7,000 from a neighbor at approximately 3 percent \ninterest per month.  He also borrowed approximately $12,000 from his closest friend at 2 percent \ninterest per month and sold his home - the only property he owned - to repay his friend. \nGuntamukkala borrowed the remainder of the fees from his family.  Guntamukkala paid all of \nthe fee installments that the Agents demanded between June and November 2006.  Dewan \nConsultants withheld his passport until he paid this money. \n227.  After arriving in the United States, Guntamukkala asked a Signal employee when \nhe would obtain his green card.  The employee told Guntamukkala that the green card paperwork \nwas being processed slowly due to the large number of people who would be obtaining green \ncards.  He told Guntamukkala not to worry, however, and assured him that he would receive a \ngreen card. \n228.  Despite the dangerous and difficult work conditions at Signal, Guntamukkala was \nafraid to complain.  When he told a supervisor that Signal was pushing him to work too hard, the \nsupervisor told him that Signal would send him back to India if he complained again. \n229.  Guntamukkala relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and \ngood working conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to \nwork for Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse \nby Signal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \n46 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 50 of 106\nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, \nGuntamukkala felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nJoy Jacob \n230.  Jacob was recruited in or about 2006. \n231.  During meetings with Dewan and Burnett in India in or about mid-2006, Dewan \nand Burnett made numerous representations that led Jacob to believe that in exchange for paying \nthousands of dollars in \"recruitment fees,\" Signal and the Agents would assist Jacob with \napplying for and receiving pennanent residency in the United States. \n232.  In reliance on these promises, Jacob incurred substantial debt and paid thousands \nof dollars in \"recruitment fees\" to Dewan, Burnett, and Pol. \n233.  After arriving in the United States, Jacob felt compelled to remain at Signal's man \ncamp and work for Signal because, among other reasons, Signal would deduct living expenses \nfrom his paycheck even ifhe lived elsewhere, his H-2B visa did not pennit him to work for \nanother U.S. employer, Signal constantly monitored him and other workers and threatened to \ndeport them if they complained about the horrible conditions at Signal, and he believed that he \nwould face financial ruin and bankruptcy if he returned to India. \n234.  Jacob relied upon Defendants' promises of penna nent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, Jacob \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \n47 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 51 of 106\nBiju John \n235.  In or about April or May of2006, John read an advertisement in an Indian \nnewspaper for a job in the United States that would pay $144 per day and promised H-2B work \nvisas or green cards.  John called Dewan Consultants and spoke with a representative of the \ncompany.  The representative told John that Malvern Burnett would obtain a green card for him \nand that the process would cost 650,000 rupees (approximately $14,515). \n236.  John attended a seminar in or about May 2006, where he met Dewan, Salimon, \nPol, Burnett, and Sanders.  They confirmed that John would need to pay 650,000 rupees in \n\"recruitment fees.\"  They also told John that ifhe paid Burnett an additional $4,000, he could \nwork anywhere in the United States. \n237.  John paid Dewan, Pol, and Burnett 650,000 rupees in three installments.  John \nalso paid an additional 400,000 rupees (approximately $8,350) in travel and other expenses \nrelated to this process, resulting in a total cost of 1,050,000 rupees (approximately $22,865). \n238.  John raised the money for these expenses and fees by selling a piece of property \nthat he owned, borrowing money from his brother, and borrowing money that his father raised by \nselling land and other items.  He also borrowed 150,000 rupees (approximately $3,130) at 5 \npercent monthly interest. \n239.  On or about November 19,2006, John traveled to Dewan's Mumbai office to \ncollect his passport and plane ticket to the United States.  Shortly before John left to catch his \nflight, Dewan gave him a \"service agreement\" document and told him to sign it immediately. \nDewan told John that he could not board the plane until he signed the agreement.  Dewan also \nsaid that if John missed his flight, he could not recover the money he had paid.  Because his \nflight was about to leave, John quickly signed the agreement without reading it.  When Dewan \n48 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 52 of 106\ngave John his passport and plane ticket, John learned he had paid twice the value of the plane \nticket. \n240.  After arriving in the United States, John felt compelled to remain at Signal's man \ncamp because Signal would deduct living expenses from his paycheck even if he lived \nelsewhere.  He was afraid to complain about the conditions at Signal because Signal threatened \nto send John and other workers back to India if they misbehaved or spoke to others about \nSignal's actions.  He felt that he could not leave his job at Signal because he needed to make \nenough money to repay the loans that he had borrowed from his family. \n241.  John relied upon Defendants' promises ofperrnanent residency and good working \nconditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work for Signal \nin the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by Signal, his \nneed to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \"recruitment \nfees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, and his fear that \nSignal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, John felt intimidated into \nacquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nShibu Joseph \n242.  In or about April 2006, Joseph read a newspaper advertisement offering the \nopportunity for pipe fitters to work in the United States and obtain green cards.  He spoke with a \nrepresentative of Dewan Consultants, who invited Joseph to attend a seminar in May to learn \nmore about the opportunity. \n243.  On or about May 2, 2006, Joseph attended a seminar at which Pol, Burnett, \nDewan, and Salimon were present.  Either Pol or Burnett (Joseph is uncertain of which) \nexplained that workers would travel to the United States on H-2B visas, which would be \nextended for 18 to 24 months while their green card applications were processed.  After they \n49 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 53 of 106\nreceived green cards, the workers would be able to bring their families to the United States. \nDewan explained that this process would cost a total of 600,300 rupees (approximately $11,000) \nto be paid in installments to Burnett, Pol, and Dewan.  Joseph called Salimon after the seminar, \nand Salimon confirmed that workers would receive H-2B visas and green cards. \n244.  In or about May 2006, Joseph took a written exam administered by a Signal \nofficial.  Salimon and Dewan were also present, and Salimon again assured Joseph that those \nwho were hired would travel to the United States on H-2B visas while their green cards were \nbeing processed. \n245.  To pay his \"recruitment fees,\" Joseph posted his wife's jewelry as collateral for a \nloan, and borrowed additional money from his brother, a friend, and his wife's family.  Joseph \nalso borrowed money from an acquaintance at approximately 3 percent interest per month. \nJoseph paid his first and second fee installments in or about August and November 2006, \nrespectively. \n246.  On the day of his flight to the United States, Joseph traveled to Dewan's office in \nMumbai and paid his final fee installment.  At Dewan's office, either Dewan's assistant or his \nbrother took all of Joseph's receipts and paperwork relating to his recruitment.  Joseph feared \nthat if he refused to give up his paperwork, he would lose the money he had paid.  Dewan then \ndemanded that Joseph quickly sign a number of papers, and said that he would not give Joseph \nhis passport if he refused.  Afraid that he would lose all of the money he had already paid and the \nopportunity to work in the United States, Joseph signed the papers without having a chance to \nread what they said. \n247.  At Signal, Joseph asked permission to live outside the man camp, but Sanders told \nhim that the costs for room and board would be deducted from his wages even if he did not live \n50 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 54 of 106\nthere.  Because he could not repay his loans ifhe also paid room and board both to Signal and \noutside the man camp, Joseph felt that he had no choice but to remain at the camp.  He felt \ncompelled to continue to work for Signal because it was the only way that he could repay his \ndebts and keep his family from being cast into poverty. \n248.  Joseph relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not bave sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, Joseph \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nSunilkumar Maroittikal Kuttan \n249.  In or about Mayor June of2006, Kuttan read a newspaper advertisement offering \nthe opportunity to work in the United States and obtain an H-2B visa and green card.  The \nadvertisement listed the contact information for Dewan Consultants.  A few days after seeing the \nadvertisement, Kuttan attended a large meeting, where Salimon, Dewan, Burnett, and Sanders \nwere present.  Dewan and Salimon explained that Kuttan and other Indian workers would travel \nto the United States and work at Signal for eleven months while their green cards were \nprocessed.  Afterwards, they would return to India for a very short time after which they could \ncome back to the United States with their families. \n250.  In or about Mayor June of2006, Kuttan met with Sanders and another American \nto take a welding test. \n51 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 55 of 106\n251.  Kuttan ultimately paid Dewan, Pol, and Burnett approximately 800,000 rupees \n(approximately $14,700).  To pay these fees, Kuttan sold his wife's wedding jewelry, borrowed \nmoney from his family, and took out a loan at 18 percent interest. \n252.  In or about December of2006, Kuttan traveled to Dewan's office to collect his \nplane ticket and passport.  Dewan required Kuttan to sign some documents before receiving his \nticket and passport.  Because Dewan rushed him, Kuttan did not have time to read the documents \nor understand what he had signed. \n253.  Kuttan relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, Kuttan \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nParshottam Ramchandra Mangani \n254.  In or about and between April and July 2006, Mangani read a newspaper \nadvertisement for a job that offered permanent residency in the United States. \n255.  In or about the summer of2006, Mangani attended a seminar in New Delhi, \nwhere Dewan and an American gave a presentation about a job opportunity.  They explained that \nMangani and other workers would travel to the United States on H-2B visas, which would then \nbe converted into green cards.  Dewan then distributed documents which stated that the process \nwould cost 700,000 rupees (approximately $15,155). \n256.  Mangani paid Dewan, Burnett, and Pol these \"recruitment fees\" in installments in \nor about and between July and November of2006.  To raise the money to pay these fees, \n52 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 56 of 106\nMangani sold a 2 acre farm that had provided much of his family's income.  He also sold a \nresidential property he owned with a relative.  After these sales, the only property his family \nowned was his father's house, where Mangani and his mother, wife, and daughter also lived. \n257.  Just before he flew to the United States, Mangani traveled to the office of \nDewan's agent.  An employee demanded that Mangani sign paperwork.  Mangani asked ifhe \ncould read the paperwork, but the employee insisted that Mangani's flight to the United States \nwould leave soon, and there was no time to read the paperwork.  Mangani felt that he had no \nchoice but to sign.  Only then did Mangani receive his passport. \n258.  After Mangani arrived in the United States, Signal required him to sign \npaperwork agreeing that Signal could deduct $245 per week from his paycheck for food and \nhousing.  When Mangani and other workers asked if they could live outside of the man camp, \nSignal employees said that they had to remain at the camp.  Signal also required Mangani to sign \npaperwork under which he agreed to pay for the tools that he used.  Because the Signal \nemployees threatened to send him back to India if he would not agree to this condition, Mangani \nsigned the paperwork. \n259.  Mangani had been told by Dewan, Burnett, and Pol that he would earn the \nequivalent of200,000 to 300,000 rupees (approximately $4,300 to $6,462) per month at Signal. \nBased on these assurances, he had expected that he would be able to repay his debts and \nrepurchase his land.  Only after signing the paperwork allowing Signal to deduct hundreds of \ndollars per week from his salary did Mangani realize how difficult it would be to realize these \ngoals. \n53 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 57 of 106\n260.  On multiple occasions, Mangani observed Signal personnel threaten to suspend or \ndeport workers who complained about the conditions at Signal.  As a result, Mangani felt \ncompelled to work quietly and without complaint. \n261.  Mangani relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, Mangani \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nPrakash Moses Kanagiah Manonmoni \n262.  In or about June 2006, Manonmoni saw an advertisement in an Indian newspaper \nannouncing a program under which pipefitters could work in the United States and receive green \ncards.  Manonmoni called the number in the advertisement and spoke to Salimon, who told him \nto attend an informational meeting in August 2006. \n263.  At this meeting, Salimon explained that Signal would process permanent \nresidency visas for the workers.  He stated that each worker would have to pay 850,000 rupees \n(approximately $18,700) plus airfare to the United States.  Salimon asked interested workers to \nsign a contract at the meeting, and said that they would be contacted about a test and an \ninterview.  Manonmoni handed his signed contract to Dewan. \n264.  Later that month, Manonmoni was invited to an interview attended by Salimon, \nDewan, Pol, and a Signal project manager.  During this meeting, he also took and passed a \nwritten pipefitters' examination. \n54 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 58 of 106\n265.  Manonmoni ultimately paid Dewan, Pol, and Burnett 600,000 rupees \n(approximately $16,940).  In order to pay these fees, Manonmoni sold a parcel ofland that he \nowned.  He also took out two loans using his wife's jewelry and his life insurance policy as \ncollateral. \n266.  Just before Manonmoni flew to the United States, he traveled to Dewan's office \nand paid his final payment.  That day, Dewan assured Manonmoni that if he followed Signal's \nrules, Manonmoni would receive a green card. \n267.  When Manonmoni arrived in the United States, he was told that Signal would \ndeduct $245 a week from his salary for accommodations, regardless of whether he lived at the \nman camp.  Because he could not afford to repay his loans and pay room and board twice, he felt \nthat he had no choice but to live at the camp. \n268.  Manonmoni relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, \nManonmoni felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nAdharsan Manuel \n269.  In or about June 2006, Manuel saw an advertisement in an Indian newspaper \noffering positions for welders in the United States and the opportunity to receive a green card. \nManuel called the number listed in the advertisement and spoke with Salimon, who told him to \nattend a meeting at a hotel. \n55 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 59 of 106\n270.  During this meeting, at which Dewan, Salimon, and Pol were present, Dewan told \nManuel and other prospective workers that they would travel to the United States on H-2B visas \nto work at Signal.  Shortly thereafter, Manuel met with Dewan at his office, where Dewan \nexplained that Manuel would also be able to receive a green card if he took the job at Signal. \n271.  On or about November 7, 2007, Manuel met with Salimon, Dewan, and Burnett to \ndiscuss his upcoming interview at the United States Consulate.  They instructed Manuel not to \nmention Signal's promise that he would receive a green card during his consular interview, \nthough Dewan and Burnett assured him that it would be taken care of once he arrived in the \nUnited States. \n272.  Manuel paid approximately 700,000 rupees (approximately $15,000) to Dewan, \nPol, and Burnett for the opportunity to work for Signal.  In order to raise this money, Manuel \ndepleted his savings and secured a loan by offering his sister'S and wife's dowries as collateral. \n273.  After he arrived in the United States, Manuel learned for the first time that he had \nto pay $35 per day for accommodations that were much worse than any he had ever experienced. \n274.  Despite the squalid living conditions and the unsafe work environment, Manuel \nfelt compelled to remain at Signal.  He knew that ifhe left, he would be sent back to India and \nwould not receive the green card he had been promised.  Manuel believed that remaining at \nSignal was the only option that would allow him to repay his substantial debt; he knew that he \ncould never make enough money to repay that debt in India.  Manuel also felt compelled to \nremain because of Signal's conduct.  Signal foremen constantly monitored Manuel- even when \nhe went to the bathroom - and threatened to notify the police and immigration officials if Manuel \nleft Signal.  Signal employee John Sanders threatened to send Manuel and other workers back to \nIndia if they complained about the conditions at the man camp.  Manuel also feared that Signal \n56 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 60 of 106\nemployees might retaliate against his family if he left or complained about the horrible \nconditions. \n275.  Manuel relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, Manuel \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nJacob Mazhukkattu Mathew \n276.  In or about June 2006, J.M. Mathew read a newspaper advertisement offering \ntemporary and permanent work visas and employment with a marine company in Mississippi and \nTexas.  He called Dewan Consultants and spoke with Salimon, who invited him to a meeting at a \nhotel. \n277.  Approximately one week later, 1.M. Mathew attended the meeting, where Dewan, \nSalimon, and Burnett were present.  At this meeting, Burnett said that the workers would travel \nto the United States on H-2B visas.  The workers would receive green cards after the H-2B visas \nhad been extended.  Dewan explained that this process would cost 600,000 rupees \n(approximately $13,000).  After the presentation, lM. Mathew spoke separately with Burnett, \nwho assured Mathew that his wife could also come to the United States after he received a green \ncard.  An employee of Dewan Consultants also assured J.M. Mathew that he could bring his wife \nand family to the United States after obtaining a green card, which the employee claimed would \noccur within two years. \n57 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 61 of 106\n278.  Soon thereafter, lM. Mathew took a skills test in the presence of Dewan, \nSalimon, and two Signal employees.  The Signal employees supervised the test and told 1.M. \nMathew that he had passed. \n279.  In order to raise the fees that 1.M. Mathew paid to Dewan, Pol, and Burnett, lM. \nMathew's mother-in-law borrowed 125,000 rupees (approximately $2,693), posting her home \nand land as collateral.  1.M. Mathew mortgaged his home and land and borrowed the remainder \nat an interest rate of approximately 12 or 13 percent per year.  1.M. Mathew paid Agents three \nfee payments in or about and between August and November of2006. \n280.  In or about December 2006, 1.M. Mathew traveled to Dewan's office where he \npaid his final fee payment.  There, he learned that Signal would deduct $35 per day from his \npaycheck for room and board.  Although he believed that this amount was too high, he felt that \nhe had no choice but to continue with the process because he had already paid Dewan, Burnett, \nand Pol a substantial amount of money that he could not recover. \n281.  In the United States, lM. Mathew remained at Signal because he continued to \nbelieve that he would receive a green card.  He met regularly with Sanders and other Signal \nemployees to discuss his immigration concerns.  In addition, at a meeting held on or about March \n8,2007, a Signal Vice President assured Mathew and other workers that they would receive \ngreen cards soon.  1.M. Mathew was afraid that ifhe returned to India, he would not be able to \nrepay his debts and would lose his house and land, as well as his mother-in-Iaw's house and land. \n282.  1.M. Mathew relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n58 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 62 of 106\n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, J .M. \nMathew felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nJohny Mathew \n283.  In or about March 2006, J. Mathew saw a newspaper advertisement in India \noffering welding jobs in the United States and the possibility of receiving a green card.  J. \nMathew called Dewan Consultants in response to the advertisement. \n284.  In or about May 2006, J. Mathew attended a meeting led by Dewan, Pol, Burnett, \nand Salimon.  At this meeting, Dewan explained that workers would travel to the United States \non 10-to-ll month H-2B visas, which would be extended three times.  During this time, Signal \nwould apply for green cards for the workers.  Dewan also stated that the workers would \neventually be able to settle permanently with their families in the United States.  Visa and green \ncard processing would cost 750,000 rupees (approximately $16,750). \n285.  In or about Mayor June 2006, J. Mathew attended and passed a skills test, at \nwhich both Salimon and Dewan were present. \n286.  J. Mathew later met with Burnett, who reiterated that 1. Mathew would first \nreceive an H-2B visa and would then get a green card.  At this meeting, J. Mathew signed an \nagreement with Signal, which Salimon interpreted for him, and which J. Mathew believed to \npromise that he would receive a green card. \n287.  J. Mathew paid the \"recruitment fees\" that Dewan, Pol, and Burnett demanded in \napproximately three installments.  In order to raise this money, J. Mathew sold his wife's \nwedding jewelry, used additional money that he had saved to buy a house, and took out a loan at \n12 percent monthly interest.  In or about the fall of2006, J. Mathew refused ajob in Kazakhstan \nso that he could stay in India and complete the necessary steps to receive his visa and green card. \n59 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 63 of 106\n288.  In or about late November 2006, a few days before his flight to the United States, \nJ. Mathew traveled to Dewan's office.  Dewan's staff forced him to sign several documents in a \nrushed manner and did not give him time to read or understand the documents.  Dewan also \ndemanded that J. Mathew return to Dewan his copy of the original signed agreement that \npromised him a green card, as well any receipts and papers related to the Signal opportunity. \nWhen J. Mathew hesitated, Dewan said that J. Mathew would not be able to go to the United \nStates unless he returned the documents.  Dewan refused to give J. Mathew his passport and \nplane ticket until he returned these documents to Dewan. \n289.  After arriving at Signal, J. Mathew learned that $35 would be deducted from his \npay each day.  Despite the reduced pay and terrible living and working conditions, J. Mathew felt \ntrapped and unable to leave Signal.  He was afraid that ifhe were sent back to India, he and his \nfamily would be thrust into poverty because of the debt he had incurred.  He was also afraid that \nhe would suffer mistreatment at the hands of Dewan and his associates. \n290.  J. Mathew relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, J. Mathew \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nNandhakumar Nagaraj \n291.  In or about Mayor June of2006, a friend of Nagaraj told him about a newspaper \nadvertisement offering the opportunity to obtain an H-2B visa and green card.  Nagaraj \nresponded to the advertisement and called Salimon.  Salimon confirmed that Nagaraj and other \n60 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 64 of 106\nworkers could obtain H-2B visas and green cards and told Nagaraj to attend a meeting in \napproximately three weeks to leam more. \n292.  Dewan, Salimon, Burnett, and Pol were present at this meeting.  They explained \nthat workers would travel to the United States on H-2B visas, and that during this time, Signal \nwould process their green card applications. \n293.  Approximately one month after the meeting, Nagaraj took a welding test \nadministered by an American.  Approximately one month after the test, Nagaraj met with \nSalimon at a hotel.  Salimon told Nagaraj that he could obtain an H-2B visa and work in the \nUnited States for ten months.  After ten months, Nagaraj would automatically receive a green \ncard and could bring his family to the United States. \n294.  Nagaraj ultimately paid Dewan, Pol, and Burnett 800,000 rupees (approximately \n$17,787) for this opportunity.  Nagaraj borrowed approximately three-fourths of these fees at a \nmonthly interest rate of 10 percent.  He also depleted his savings and sold property and jewelry \nthat his mother had received for her wedding from Nagaraj's grandfather. \n295.  Just before Nagaraj left for the United States, he traveled to Dewan's office in \nMumbai.  Dewan refused to give Nagaraj his passport until Nagaraj had paid the final installment \nand signed various documents.  Nagaraj asked if he could read the documents, but Dewan \nrefused and insisted that Nagaraj sign quickly so that he would not miss his flight to the United \nStates. \n296.  After arriving in the United States, Nagaraj learned that Signal would deduct $245 \nfrom his paycheck each week for room and board.  When he asked Signal employees ifhe could \nlive outside the man camp, he was told that he was not permitted to live elsewhere.  Nagaraj felt \n61 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 65 of 106\ncompelled to remain at Signal's man camp because he would not be able to repay his substantial \ndebt if he was required to pay additional money for housing and food. \n297.  Nagaraj relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, Nagaraj \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nShaji Veluthalakuzhiyil Nanoo \n298.  In or about April or May of2006, Nanoo saw a newspaper advertisement placed \nby Dewan Consultants offering the opportunity for welders and pipefitters to work in the United \nStates, and promising green cards and legal status for the workers and their families.  Nanoo \ncalled the phone number listed in the advertisement and spoke to Salimon.  Salimon said that the \nopportunity would include green card processing and that the process would cost 530,000 rupees \n(approximately $11,850). \n299.  In or about May 2006, Nanoo traveled to Cochin, India for an interview and skills \ntest attended by Salimon and Dewan.  At the interview, Salimon said that Signal would apply for \nNanoo's green card once he arrived in the United States. Soon thereafter, at a meeting attended \nby Pol, Burnett, Dewan, and Salimon, Burnett also assured Nanoo that Signal would begin to \nprocess his green card once he arrived in the United States. \n300.  Nanoo faced considerable difficulties raising the money that he ultimately paid to \nDewan, Pol, and Burnett.  He mortgaged his land at approximately 12 percent interest and used \njewelry belonging to his wife, sister, and sister-in-law as collateral for an additional loan.  He \n62 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 66 of 106\nalso sold more family jewelry.  Nonetheless, he was still unable to raise the total amount \nrequired. \n301.  Before he was scheduled to leave for the United States, Nanoo visited Dewan's \noffice to pay his final fee installments and collect his ticket.  Nanoo signed various documents, \nbut because Dewan's assistants rushed him, he did not have a chance to read or understand what \nhe was signing. \n302.  Before Nanoo was able to collect his ticket and passport, Dewan's assistants \ndetermined that Nanoo still owed a portion of his fees.  Dewan refused to give Nanoo his \npassport until he had paid the remainder ofthe fees.  Nanoo called his brother-in-law, who \nhelped him raise some additional money.  Only after Nanoo paid the full amount demanded by \nthe Agents was he allowed to board the next flight to the United States. \n303.  In the United States, Nanoo learned that Signal would deduct $245 per week for \nfood and housing from his paycheck, regardless of whether he lived in the man camp.  Despite \nthe terrible living conditions, the fees that Signal charged him made it prohibitively expensive to \nlive elsewhere. \n304.  Nanoo's debt also made him feel compelled him to continue to endure the unsafe \nworking conditions at Signal.  Once, after Nanoo complained that the ships he worked on were \nunsafe, a Signal foreman suspended Nanoo for six days without pay.  Nanoo knew that other \nIndian workers had experienced threats, retaliation, and deportation when they expressed their \nconcerns about the conditions.  N anoo feared that if he were sent back to India, he would not be \nable to repay his debt, he would lose the land that he had mortgaged, and he and his family \nwould become homeless.  He was also worried that Dewan or his associates would hurt him or \nhis family. \n63 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 67 of 106\n305.  Nanoo relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, Nanoo \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nMangalan Chandrasekharan Pillai \n306.  In or about June 2006, M. Pillai saw an advertisement in a Dubai newspaper \noffering the opportunity for pipefitters to work in the United States and receive green cards.  The \nadvertisement invited interested workers to attend a meeting at a Dubai hotel. \n307.  At this meeting, Dewan explained that Signal was looking for Indian workers to \ntravel to the United States under H-2B visas to repair oil rigs.  The H-2B visas would be renewed \ntwo to three times.  After that, the workers would receive green cards and would be able to bring \ntheir families to the United States.  Dewan also explained that workers would be required to pay \nBurnett, Pol, and Dewan visa and green card processing fees. \n308.  M. Pillai later took a skills test.  When he was notified that he had passed, he \nreturned to the hotel.  There, Dewan gave him a letter stating that M. Pillai would receive an H-\n2B visa and green card in exchange for processing fees. \n309.  M. Pillai ultimately paid approximately 600,000 rupees (approximately $\\3,056) \nto Burnett, Pol, and Dewan.  In order to raise this money, M. Pillai pawned his mother's and \nwife's jewelry and borrowed money from a friend.  M. Pillai also took out two loans at 7 to 10 \npercent monthly interest, and an additional loan at 18 percent annual interest. \n64 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 68 of 106\n310.  In or about November 2006, M. Pillai traveled to Dewan's office to pay the final \ninstallments of his fees and receive his passport.  After he gave the money to Dewan's brother, \nDewan's associates rushed him out of the office before he could ask any questions or ask for a \nreceipt. \n311.  After arriving in the United States, M. Pillai learned for the first time about the \nterrible living and working conditions and the substantial deduction that Signal took from each \nworker's paycheck for accommodations.  M. Pillai did not complain about the living and \nworking conditions, however, because he saw that Signal threatened to deport workers who \n\"caused trouble.\"  M. Pillai also feared that if he were sent back to India, he would be unable to \nrepay his debts. \n312.  M. Pillai relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, M. Pillai \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nRadhakrishna Pillai Sivarama Pillai \n313.  In or about May 2006, R. Pillai saw an advertisement in a local Indian paper \noffering job opportunities for pipefitters in the United States.  He called the number in the \nadvertisement and eventually met with Salimon.  Salimon told R. Pillai that Signal would begin \nhis green card application when he arrived in the United States, and that the process would take \napproximately ten months. \n65 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 69 of 106\n3 J4 .  In or about June or July 2006, R. Pillai traveled to Cochin, India for an interview \nand skills test.  Salimon and another representative of Signal reaffirmed that Signal would apply \nfor R. PilIai' s green card. \n315.  R. Pillai also attended a meeting in October 2006, at which Salimon, Dewan, and \nat least one other Agent were present.  They explained that as soon as the workers began working \nin the United States, Signal would begin their green card applications.  The process would take \napproximately ten months, at the end of which the workers would be able to bring their families \nto the United States.  At the October meeting, R. Pillai was required to sign several documents. \nThe Agents told him that he had to sign each document to come to the United States, but they did \nnot explain the contents of the documents, and R. Pillai did not understand what they said. \n316.  R. Pillai ultimately paid Pol, Burnett, and Dewan approximately 900,000 rupees \n(approximately $19,855) in \"recruitment fees.\"  To raise the money for these fees, R. Pillai took \nout three loans at 8.5 percent monthly interest, secured by his brother's house and all of his \nfamily's jewelry. \n317.  On or about November 17, 2006, R. Pillai met with Dewan to collect his plane \nticket.  At this meeting, he signed additional documents that were not explained to him. \n318.  In the United States, R. Pillai was appalled by the unsanitary living conditions, the \nunsafe work environment, Signal's discriminatory behavior, and the substantial fees Signal \nrequired him to pay for room and board.  R. Pillai felt he had no choice but to endure these \nconditions and continue to work for Signal, however, because he was afraid that if he \ncomplained, he would be sent back to India, where he would be unable to repay the debt he had \nincurred to pay Dewan, Pol, and Burnett. \n66 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 70 of 106\n319.

Pillai relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would take adverse immigration action against him, R. Pillai \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nAby Molathu Poulose \n320.  In or about March or April of2006, A. Poulose saw an advertisement in a Dubai \nnewspaper which promised an opportunity to work in the United States and to obtain an H-2B \nvisa and a green card.  A. Poulose called Dewan Consultants and was told to attend a meeting in \nDubai. \n321.  At that meeting, Dewan explained that workers hired by Signal would travel to \nthe United States on H-2B visas and would receive green cards within nine to nineteen months. \nDewan explained that this process would cost700,000 rupees (approximately $15,764) and that, \nin the United States, the workers would earn 250,000 rupees (approximately $5,630) per month \nafter taxes.  Dewan also told A. Poulose that workers from Signal would be coming to India to \nadminister employment tests. \n322.  Soon after the meeting, A. Poulose called Dewan to ask ifhe could meet Signal's \nrepresentatives in India for the job testing.  Dewan agreed. \n323.  At the test, Signal personnel explained to A. Poulose that Signal was the \"number \none shipyard\" in America and that Signal had sufficient political power that A. Poulose need not \nto worry about his visa.  They also assured A. Poulose that Signal would apply for his green card \nand that it would be processed while A. Poulose was working in the United States. \n67 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 71 of 106\n324.  In or about August 2006, A. Poulose attended another meeting at which Burnett, \nDewan, and Salimon were present.  Burnett told A. Poulose and other workers that he was a \nfamous immigration lawyer and that 600 H -2B visas with green cards had been approved for \nSignal. \n325.  A. Poulose ultimately paid almost 800,000 rupees (approximately $18,061) to \nDewan, Pol, and Burnett.  In order to raise this sum, A. Poulose borrowed 300,000 rupees \n(approximately $7,038) at 11 percent interest using his  parents' house and land as collateral. \nBecause he was unable to secure money elsewhere, A. Poulose and his family eventually sold \nthis property to finance the balance of his \"recruitment fees.\"  Nonetheless, by the time he was \nscheduled to depart for the United States, A. Poulose still needed to raise an additional 20,000 \nrupees (approximately $450). \n326.  On the morning of A. Poulose's flight to the United States, Dewan threatened to \nburn A. Poulose's passport unless A. Poulose paid the missing 20,000 rupees.  He stated that he \nwould not refund any of the money that A. Poulose had paid.  A. Poulose ultimately paid the full \namount after his father offered Dewan the money that he intended to use to pay rent that month. \n327.  Before Dewan gave A. Poulose his passport, he required A. Poulose to sign \npaperwork.  A. Poulose did not have time to read the documents because his flight would leave \nsoon. \n328.  After arriving in the United States, A. Poulose felt compelled to remain at Signal. \nHis H-2B visa prevented him from working for another employer in the United States and he \ncould not earn enough money to repay his debts if he returned to India.  Therefore, he felt that he \nhad no choice but to continue working for Signal, despite the deplorable conditions. \n68 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 72 of 106\n329.  A. Poulose relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, A. \nPoulose felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nJustin Poulose \n330.  In or about the summer of2006, 1. Poulose was working as a welder in Kerala, \nIndia, when he saw a newspaper advertisement offering jobs for welders and pipefitters at Signal. \nThe advertisement mentioned green cards and said that workers could obtain visas that would \nallow them to travel to the United States immediately.  J. Poulose called the phone number listed \nin the advertisement and spoke to Salimon.  Salimon told 1. Poulose that he could learn more \nabout the immigration process and j ob opportunity at a meeting. \n331.  1. Poulose attended the meeting that week.  He met with Pol, who was introduced \nan official of the American company recruiting workers.  He also met with Dewan and Salimon. \nPol explained that J. Poulose could work for Signal.  Pol said that 1. Poulose would travel to the \nUnited States on an H-2B visa and would obtain permanent residency status within one year, at \nwhich point he would be able to bring his family.  Pol also stated that J. Poulose could earn \naround $16 to $19 per hour at Signal. \n332.  At the meeting, Dewan and Salimon explained that this process would cost \n800,000 rupees (approximately $18,000).  J. Poulose felt that this would be a good opportunity, \nbut he was worried that he would not be able to afford the fees. \n69 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 73 of 106\n333.  Approximately four to six weeks later, a woman from Salimon's office called J. \nPoulose.  She explained that the fees could be reduced to 650,000 rupees (approximately \n$14,163).  She told 1. Poulose that he should obtain the money and take a skills test.  J. Poulose \nwas hesitant, but based on the salary he had been promised, he believed that he would be able to \nafford the lower price and repay his debts. \n334.  On or about July 5, 2006, J. Poulose took and passed a skills test administered by \nSignal representatives.  Dewan and Salimon were also present.  Dewan said that J. Poulose \nwould be able to receive permanent residency status in the United States.  At a later meeting, \nSalimon also gave J. Poulose a letter promising employment at Signal, an H-2B visa, and \npermanent residency. \n335.  To raise the money that he paid to Dewan, Pol, and Burnett, J. Poulose took out \nmultiple loans, including two with monthly interest rates of approximately 10.5 percent.  He used \nhis mother's wedding jewelry as collateral for one ofthese loans, and the deeds to his family's \nhouse and land as collateral for the other.  He also took out a third loan with a monthly interest \nrate of approximately 6 percent.  J. Poulose paid all three fee installments totaling approximately \n650,000 rupees by November 2006. \n336.  On the morning of 1. Poulose's flight to the United States, he traveled to Dewan's \noffice in Mumbai to obtain his passport.  The office was crowded, and J. Poulose was forced to \nwait in a long line before he could meet with anyone.  Eventually, J. Poulose met with a Dewan \nConsultants employee who insisted that J. Poulose quickly sign paperwork written in \nEnglish.  The employee rushed 1. Poulose to sign and did not give him time to read the \ndocuments, emphasizing that his flight would leave soon and that there were several people in \nthe office.  At the same time, J. Poulose saw Dewan threaten a worker who did not have enough \n70 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 74 of 106\nmoney to make his final payment to Dewan.  Dewan told the worker that he could not go to the \nUnited States and stapled his passport shut.  This made 1. Poulose nervous, and he felt pressured \nto sign immediately.  Only after he signed the documents did he receive his passport and plane \nticket. \n337.  After J. Poulose arrived in the United States, he learned that Signal was deducting \n$35 per day from his paycheck.  Signal's camp manager informed J. Poulose that the company \nwould deduct this amount from his wages even if 1. Poulose lived outside of the man \ncamp.  Because he could not afford to repay his substantial debt and pay room and board outside \nthe man camp with these deductions, J. Poulose felt compelled to remain and work at the man \ncamp. \n338.  Months later, Signal held a camp meeting where Dewan, Burnett, Sanders, \nSnyder, and other officials were present.  Both Dewan and Burnett assured J. Poulose and other \nworkers that they would receive their visa extensions and that Signal would continue with their \ngreen card processing.  Dewan warned, however, that the workers had to follow Signal's \ninstructions at all times if they did not want to be deported.  After this meeting, J. Poulose feared \nthat ifhe did anything to make Signal management unhappy, he would be deported and would \nnot be able to repay his debts. \n339.  On or about March 10,2007, J. Poulose attended a camp meeting led by John \nSanders.  Sanders assured 1. Poulose and other workers that if they followed Signal's rules, they \nwould receive green cards.  However, if they organized against Signal, then they would not be \nable to stay.  After the meeting, 1. Poulose saw notices on the man camp's notice board \ninstructing workers to bring documents to an office at the camp in order to obtain green cards.  1. \nPoulose followed these instructions, and as a result believed that his visa would be extended. \n71 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 75 of 106\n340.  In or about july of2007, J. Poulose again met with Burnett.  Burnett told 1. \nPoulose that if he continued to work for Signal, his H-2B visa could be extended, and it would \neventually be possible to file a green card application.  Based on this promise, 1. Poulose \ncontinued to work at Signal. \n341.  J. Poulose relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, J. \nPoulose felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nAppunniArulPrakash \n342.  In or about April of2006, Prakash's wife told him about ajob advertisement \noffering work as a welder or fitter in the United States and the opportunity to obtain a green card \nwithin 18 to 24 months.  Prakash called Dewan Consultants and spoke to a representative who \nsaid that he could work at Signal and obtain a green card.  The representative said that this \nprocess would cost about 700,000 rupees (approximately $15,650), and invited Prakash to attend \na general meeting in May. \n343.  At the May 2006 meeting, Dewan explained that Prakash and other workers \nwould work for Signal.  Pol stated that Signal would file for green cards within 18 to 24 months, \nand that after the workers received their green cards, they would return to India then go back to \nAmerica with their families.  Pol and Dewan also assured those at the meeting that the green card \nprocessing would proceed as promised.  Pol stated that this process would cost workers 700,000 \nrupees (approximately $15,650); Salimon repeated this price as well. \n72 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 76 of 106\n344.  In or about August 2006, Prakash attended another meeting where Dewan, \nSalimon, and Burnett were present.  Burnett explained that Prakash would receive a green card \nwithin 24 months and that he could bring his family to the United States. \n345.  In or about November 2006, Prakash attended another meeting with Burnett, \nDewan, Salimon, and Sanders.  Burnett explained that Prakash would travel to the United States \non an H-2B visa, which Signal would extend twice.  Prakash would then receive a green card. \nSanders also assured Prakash that Signal would take care of his visa. \n346.  Prakash ultimately paid the 700,000 rupees demanded by the Agents.  To raise \nthis money, Prakash's family mortgaged their home and land in exchange for a loan of about \n400,000 rupees (approximately $9000) at twelve percent monthly interest.  Prakash obtained \nanother loan of approximately 100,000 rupees (approximately $2250) at a monthly interest rate \nof approximately 23 percent.  He also borrowed 150,000 to 200,000 rupees (approximately \n$3300 to $4500) at 9 or 10 percent interest using as collateral jewelry that his wife and sister had \nreceived for their weddings, and that had significant sentimental value. \n347.  On the day of Prakash's flight to the United States, he traveled to Dewan's office \nin Mumbai to obtain his passport and plane ticket.  Dewan demanded that Prakash return to \nDewan his copies of original signed agreements.  When Prakash resisted, Dewan threatened that \nPrakash would not receive his passport or plane ticket.  While Prakash was waiting at the office, \nhe saw Dewan threaten to bum another worker's passport until that man paid Dewan the \nremaining money that Dewan demanded.  Prakash therefore feared that he would not be able to \ntravel to the United States unless he gave Dewan his paperwork.  Prakash gave Dewan all of his \noriginal documents.  Dewan then insisted that Prakash sign paperwork written in English if \n73 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 77 of 106\nPrakash wanted to receive his passport or plane ticket.  Prakash knew that his flight would soon \nbe leaving, so he quickly signed the paperwork without understanding what it said. \n348.  Although Prakash knew Signal would be deducting money from his paycheck for \nroom and board before he left India, he did not realize until he arrived at Signal that the amount \nto be deducted was almost $1,050 per month.  Because of Prakash's heavy debt burden and \nbecause he would have to pay this amount even if he lived outside of the man camp, he felt that \nhe had no choice but to continue living at the man camp.  Prakash also felt compelled to remain \nat Signal because Signal assured him that he could obtain a green card ifhe stayed and \nperformed well and he believed that he would not be able to repay his debts working in India. \n349.  Prakash relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would soon adverse immigration action against him, Prakash \nfelt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nSreenivasarao Raparthy \n350.  On or about June 26, 2006, Raparthy learned from a friend about newspaper \nadvertisements offering the opportunity to work as a welder or pipefitter at an American \nshipyard.  In response to the advertisement, Raparthy attended an interview session, where \nDewan and Burnett were present.  At the interview session, Dewan and Burnett told him that if \nhe worked in the United States, he could obtain an H-2B visa and then a green card. \n74 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 78 of 106\n351.  The same day, Raparthy took a written test administered by Signal employees. \nRaparthy passed the test, and the employees gave him paperwork promising an H-2B visa and \npermanent residency. \n352.  Approximately three days later, Raparthy attended a meeting with Dewan.  At that \nmeeting, Dewan assured Raparthy that he could travel to the United States on an H-2B visa. \nDewan also told Raparthy that an H-2B visa extension and a green card application would be \nfiled without Raparthy needing to take additional steps.  Dewan gave Raparthy a document \nsigned by Burnett, which promised an H-2B visa and permanent residency. \n353.  Following Dewan's instructions,  Raparthy paid approximately 600,000 rupees \n(approximately $12,500) to Dewan, Burnett, and Pol.  To raise the money for these fees, \nRaparthy borrowed approximately one-third of the amount from a bank at three percent monthly \ninterest.  He borrowed another third at six percent interest using his wife's and mother's gold \njewelry as collateral.  He borrowed the balance from friends. \n354.  On the day of his flight to the United States, Dewan's agents insisted that \nRaparthy sign additional paperwork if he wanted to receive his passport or plane ticket. \nRaparthy asked ifhe could read the paperwork but was told that he would miss his flight ifhe \nreviewed the paperwork.  Raparthy signed, and only then received his passport and ticket. \n355.  After Raparthy arrived in the United States, he discovered that Signal deducted \napproximately $245 from his paycheck each week for room and board.  Raparthy asked Darrell \nSnyder and other Signal management if he could live outside the man camp, but Snyder told \nRapartby that Signal would deduct the amount from his paycheck even if he lived elsewhere. \nRaparthy felt compelled to continue living at the man camp because he could not afford to repay \nhis debt if Signal continued to deduct room and board and he paid for rent elsewhere. \n75 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 79 of 106\n356.  Raparthy relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, \nRaparthy felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nMookaparambilltty Raveendranathan \n357.  In or about late 2005, Raveendranathan saw a newspaper advertisement in Abu \nDhabi offering the opportunity to work in the United States.  Raveendranathan called the phone \nnumber listed on the advertisement and spoke with Dewan.  Dewan told Raveendranathan to \nattend an upcoming meeting at a hotel in Abu Dhabi. \n358.  Approximately one month later, Raveendranathan attended the meeting.  Only \ntwo other potential workers were present.  Dewan gave a presentation and stated that the \nopportunity to work in the United States would cost 500,000 rupees (approximately $10,600). \nRaveendranathan was hesitant to pursue the opportunity because he thought the cost was too \nhigh. \n359.  In or about February 2006, a friend told Raveendranathan that he had given \nmoney to Dewan Consultants.  Raveendranathan called Salimon, who told Raveendranathan to \nattend another upcoming meeting at a hotel.  Dewan and two other people led that meeting. \nDewan explained to the audience that they were looking for employees to work in the United \nStates for Signal and obtain a visa and permanent residency.  Dewan explained that the workers \nwould receive green cards after arriving in the United States and could bring their families for an \nadditional fee.  He again said that this process would cost 500,000 rupees (approximately \n76 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 80 of 106\n$10,600), which would include payments to Dewan, Pol, and Burnet.  Dewan explained that Pol \nand Burnett worked with Signal. \n360.  Shortly after the meeting, Raveendranathan took a skills test administered by \nSignal employees.  He was then interviewed by Signal's piping superintendent.  These Signal \nemployees told Raveendranathan that he would obtain an H-2B visa within 6 months, and would \nreceive a green card within 18 months to 2 years. \n361.  Raveendranathan paid all of the fees demanded by Dewan, Pol, and Burnett.  He \nraised the money for these fees by mortgaging his home and taking out a loan at an interest rate \nof approximately 13.5 percent. \n362.  The day that Raveendranathan was scheduled to fly to the United States, he met \nwith Dewan at his office in Mumbai.  Dewan refused to give Raveendranthan his passport until \nRaveendranathan paid the remaining balance of his fees and gave Dewan all of the documents \nrelating to his recruitment.  Then, just before Raveendranathan left for the airport, Dewan \nrequired Raveendranthan to sign several documents.  Raveendranathan did not understand the \ndocuments, but he felt that he had no choice but to sign because he had already paid so much \nmoney to the Agents and knew that they would not refund these fees. \n363.  After Raveendranathan arrived at Signal, Signal deducted approximately $400 to \n$450 each week from his paycheck for room and board.  Because this cost would be deducted \neven if he lived elsewhere, he felt compelled to remain at the man camp.  He also feared that if \nhe complained, he might be fired or deported. \n364.  In or about February 2007, Dewan came to Signal and explained to \nRaveendranathan and the other workers that their visas would be extended, and that they would \neventually receive green cards.  Raveendranathan felt compelled to remain at Signal because \n77 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 81 of 106\nDefendants had promised him a green card.  He was afraid that if he were sent back to India, he \nwould not be able to repay his debts. \n365.  Raveendranathan relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and \ngood working conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to \nwork for Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse \nby Signal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, \nRaveendranathan felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for \nSignal. \nBalwinder Singh \n366.  B. Singh was recruited in or about 2006. \n367.  During meetings with Dewan and Burnett in India in or about mid-2006, Dewan \nand Burnett made numerous representations that led B. Singh to believe that in exchange for \npaying thousands of dollars in \"recruitment fees,\" Signal and the Agents would assist B. Singh \nwith applying for and receiving permanent residency in the United States. \n368.  In reliance on these promises, B. Singh incurred substantial debt and paid \nthousands of dollars in \"recruitment fees\" to Dewan, Burnett, and Pol. \n369.  After arriving in the United States, B. Singh felt compelled to remain at Signal's \nman camp despite crowded housing because, among other reasons, Signal would deduct living \nexpenses from his paycheck even ifhe lived elsewhere, his H-2B visa did not permit him to work \nfor another U.S. employer, Signal constantly monitored the workers and threatened to deport \nthem if they complained about the horrible conditions at Signal, and he believed that he would \nface financial ruin and bankruptcy if he returned to India. \n78 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 82 of 106\n370.  B. Singh relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, B. \nSingh felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nRanjit Singh \n371.  In or about Mayor June of 2006, R. Singh saw an advertisement in a Dubai \nnewspaper for a welding job at Signal.  The advertisement included Dewan Consultants' name \nand stated that permanent residency visas would be available for workers and families.  R. Singh \ncalled Dewan's office and spoke with one of his employees, who told R. Singh to travel to the \nNew Delhi office with 40,000 rupees (approximately $873) to apply for the job. \n372.  At Dewan's office, Dewan's employee explained to R. Singh and approximately \ntwelve other applicants that they would travel to the United States on a visa, the visa would be \nextended, and they would obtain a green card within two or three years.  The employee assured \nthem that American lawyers would handle the permanent residency visa process.  The employee \nalso explained that the process would cost between 650,000 and 700,000 rupees (approximately \n$14,000 and $15,000) after travel expenses.  At another meeting approximately two weeks later \nand in subsequent conversations, the employee explained that R. Singh would pay the fees to \nDewan, Burnett, and Pol. \n373.  R. Singh paid these \"recruitment fees\" in approximately three installments in or \nabout and between May and October of 2006.  To raise the money for the fees, R. Singh emptied \nhis savings, borrowed money from friends and his wife's parents, and sold his wife'sjewe1ry.  R. \n79 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 83 of 106\nโข \nSingh's father also gave up title to two acres of property, which included his farm and home, in \nexchange for loans of totaling approximately 400,000 rupees (approximately $8,800). \n374.  After R. Singh  had raised the money needed to pay the fees, he met with Dewan \nand Burnett.  They both assured R. Singh that he would receive a green card. \n375.  In or about October 2006, R. Singh quit his job in Dubai in order to attend his \ninterview at the United States Consulate. \n376.  Just before R. Singh's flight to the United States, Dewan forced him to sign \nseveral papers in English, which R. Singh does not speak or read.  Dewan and his employee \nassured him that the papers were related to legal work.  Dewan refused to explain to R. Singh \nwhat he was signing.  R. Singh only received his passport back after he signed this paperwork. \n377.  R. Singh relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, R. \nSingh felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nShanmugam Subramanian \n378.  In or about 2006, Subramanian was working as a pipefitter in Singapore when a \nfriend in India sent him a newspaper advertisement offering jobs in the United States.  It stated \nthat workers would travel to the United States on H-2B visas and would then receive green cards. \nSubramanian quit his job in Singapore and traveled to India to respond to the advertisement.  He \narrived in India in or about April 2006. \n80 \n\n.---------\n------\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 84 of 106\n379.  In India, Subramanian attended a meeting where he met Salimon and filled out an \napplication.  He later met Pol, Dewan, and Salimon for an interview.  After the interview, \nSalimon assured Subramanian that if he was selected and accepted the job, Signal would apply \nfor his green card once he arrived in the United States.  Salimon soon called Subramanian to tell \nhim he had been selected for the job. \n380.  Soon thereafter, Subramanian met with Salimon, who gave him a document \nstating that Subramanian would need to pay Dewan, Pol, and Burnett a series of payments \ntotaling 600,000 rupees (approximately $13,200). \n381.  Subramanian paid all the fees demanded by the Agents.  In order to pay these \nfees, Subramanian used the money he had saved from his job in Singapore and pledged his \nmother's and sister's jewelry as collateral in exchange for a loan of350,000 rupees \n(approximately $7,700) at 5 percent monthly interest. \n382.  When he arrived at Signal, Subramanian was appalled at the squalid living \nconditions.  He also learned that approximately $1,050 per month would be .deducted from his \nwages, regardless of whether he chose to live at the man camp.  Subramanian felt that he had no \nchoice but to stay with Signal because he needed to repay the substantial debts he had incurred in \norder to take the job.  Subramanian was afraid to complain about the living and working \nconditions because he knew that Signal fired workers who complained. \n383.  Subramanian relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \n81 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 85 of 106\nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, \nSubramanian felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nNinan John Tharakan \n384.  In or about May 2006, Tharakan was working in Dubai when a friend told him \nabout an advertisement offering pipe fitting jobs in the United States.  Tharakan called the \nnumber that his friend gave him and spoke with a representative of Dewan Consultants.  The \nrepresentative invited him to an informational meeting at a hotel in Dubai. \n385.  At the meeting, Dewan told Tharakan that those who were hired would work for a \nlarge U.S. company.  They would receive a green card after working for eighteen months.  At \nthat point, they would be able to bring their families to the United States. \n386.  In or about June 2006, Dewan and a Signal employee interviewed Tharakan and \nadministered a written test.  After being notified that he had passed the test, Tharakan again met \nwith Dewan.  Dewan told him that he would travel to the United States on an H-2B visa, which \nwould be extended until his green card had been processed.  Dewan said that Signal would take \ncare of the immigration paperwork. \n387.  During this meeting and later meetings in or about June and July 2006, Dewan \nand his employees told Tharakan that he must pay 700,000 rupees (approximately $15,344) to \nDewan, Pol, and Burnett for visa and green card processing. \n388.  Tharakan raised the money to pay the fees by selling his and his wife's wedding \nnngs.  He used the remainder of his wife's jewelry as collateral for a loan at 13 percent interest, \nand took out another loan at 21 percent interest.  Tharakan also used money that he had \npreviously borrowed to buy property in India.  Tharakan paid the first three installments of his \nfees in or about June and July 2006. \n82 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 86 of 106\n389.  In or about September 2006, Tharakan took emergency leave from his job in \nDubai to attend his H-2B visa interview at the United States Consulate in India.  Because \nTharakan had to wait almost two months for an interview date, his employer fired him. \n390.  On the day of his flight to the United States, Tharakan traveled to Dewan's office, \nwhere he paid his final installment.  Dewan refused to give Tharakan his passport and ticket until \nhe had paid his fees, given Dewan his receipts, and signed two or three blank pieces of paper. \n391.  Upon arrival in the United States, Tharakan was shocked by the living conditions \nat Signal's Mississippi facility.  He was also surprised to learn that Signal would deduct $35 per \nday from his paycheck, even if he chose to live outside of the man camp.  Nonetheless, Tharakan \ndid not feel that he could complain or leave his job due to his debt, Signal's threats of \ndeportation, and his fears that Dewan might hurt his family. \n392.  Moreover, Signal officials and Burnett had told the workers during a camp \nmeeting that Signal would extend their visas up and file their green card applications.  Tharakan \nbelieved these promises and wanted to remain in the company's good favor so he would receive \nhis green card. \n393.  Tharakan relied upon Defendants' promises ofperrnanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, \nTharakan felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \n83 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 87 of 106\nGeorge Pulikkeparambil Varghese \n394.  In or about November and December 2003, Varghese's sister-in-Iaw's father told \nVarghese's son about an opportunity to work in the United States as a welder.  Varghese's sister \nin-law told Varghese's son that there would be a meeting to learn more about the opportunity. \nVarghese's son attended the meeting. \n395.  Soon thereafter, Varghese met with Dewan and Salimon.  Dewan told Varghese \nthat his son could work in America as a welder.  He explained that this process would cost at \nleast 500,000 rupees (approximately $10,700). \n396.  Varghese and his son paid these fees to Dewan, Pol, and Burnett.  To make these \npayments, Varghese sold some gold jewelry owned by the family.  He also mortgaged his home \nto borrow a large amount of money from a bank at an interest rate of approximately 17.9 percent. \nVarghese and his son made their final payments to Dewan and Salimon in or about August 2004. \n397.  For approximately two years after he made his final payment, Varghese's son \nremained in India but heard nothing from Defendants.  Varghese's son repeatedly called \nSalimon, who assured him that he would be able to go to the United States soon. \n398.  In or about June 2006, Varghese and his son learned from friends that Dewan \nConsultants was still interviewing people.  Then in or about August 2006, Varghese saw a \nnewspaper advertisement in which Dewan Consultants offered opportunities for pipefitters and \nwelders to work in the United States.  Varghese's son called Dewan Consultants and spoke with \nSalimon.  Salimon explained that Dewan Consultants was conducting interviews for people to \nwork for Signal and travel to the United States on an H-2B visa.  Salimon said that Varghese and \nhis son should attend a meeting on or about September 8, 2006. \n399.  At this meeting, Dewan and Salimon explained that they were looking for people \nto travel to the United States on H-2B visas, which would be extended while their green cards \n84 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 88 of 106\nwere processed.  Varghese's son decided to travel to the United States and work at Signal, but he \nfailed his visa interview and could not go.  Salimon told Varghese that Varghese could work at \nSignal instead. \n400.  Varghese completed his interview process and gave Dewan Consultants his \npassport for visa processing.  Salimon then told Varghese that he would have to pay an \nadditional 278,000 rupees (approximately $6,308) in cash within one day.  Varghese paid this \nfee.  In order to raise the money, he borrowed some money from his brother and sisters, and used \nhis savings to finance the remainder. \n401.  On the day of his flight to the United States, Varghese traveled to Dewan's office \nin Mumbai.  A large number of people were waiting in Dewan's office, and Varghese had to wait \nalmost the entire day before anyone at the office met with him.  When Dewan's brother finally \nmet with Varghese, he told Varghese that he had to sign a document written in English before he \ncould receive his plane ticket.  Because Varghese needed to leave for the airport immediately, he \ndid not have enough time to read the document.  He signed quickly and left the office. \n402.  After he arrived at Signal, Varghese worked for approximately two weeks.  Signal \nemployees then told him that there was not enough work for him, and they would let him know \nwhen he could work again.  Varghese did not work for two weeks.  Then, Darryl Snyder told him \nthat he could work, but only for $9 per hour.  Snyder said that if Varghese refused, he would \nhave to go back to India.  Afraid of being sent back to India, where he would not be able to repay \nhis debts, Varghese felt that he had no choice but to work for the lower wage. \n403.  Varghese relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \n85 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 89 of 106\nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, \nVarghese felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nBenny Kattukariyil Varkey \n404.  In or about February 2006, Varkey's co-worker told him about an opportunity \nfrom Dewan Consultants to work as a welder in the United States and obtain a green card. \nVarkey called Dewan Consultants and spoke with Salimon, who told him to attend a seminar in \nApril or May. \n405.  In or about March 2006, Varkey called Dewan Consultants again and spoke with \nSalimon, who invited him to come to his office.  Salimon explained that Varkey would travel to \nthe United States on an H-2B visa that would later become a green card.  He said that the total \ncost would be 800,000 rupees (approximately $18,080).  Salimon told Varkey to look for an \nadvertisement giving the details about a meeting at the Hilton Hotel.  That same day, Varkey saw \nthe advertisement for the meeting.  This advertisement also offered the opportunity to obtain an \nH-2B visa and a green card. \n406.  At the seminar, Salimon, Dewan, and an American whom Dewan explained was a \nlawyer for Signal gave a presentation about the jobs at Signal.  Dewan promised the workers that \nthey would receive green cards.  Similarly, the American lawyer assured them that they would \ntravel to the United States on H-2B visas that would become green cards after nine months. \nAfter the presentation, Dewan reiterated that the cost for the green card would be 800,000 rupees \n(approximately $18,080).  These fees would be paid to Dewan, Pol, and Burnett. \n86 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 90 of 106\n407.  In or about June 2006, Varkey took a skills test administered by a Signal \nemployee.  Salimon and Dewan were also present.  The Signal representative informed Varkey \nthat he passed.  Varkey began to raise the money to pay the Agents their \"recruitment fees.\" \n408.  To raise the money to pay the fees, Varkey depleted the savings that had set aside \nto buy a house for his family.  Varkey also borrowed money from his brother and used his wife's \ngold jewelry as collateral to obtain a second loan.  Varkey's wife had received this jewelry as a \nwedding gift from her parents, who had spent their life savings to purchase it.  Varkey and his \nbrother mortgaged their properties to obtain additional loans. \n409.  Varkey paid his first payment at Dewan's office in or about June 2006.  Salimon \ntold Varkey to sign papers written in English, which he did not fully understand.  He told Varkey \nthat the papers were for his green card processing. \n410.  In or about August 2006, Varkey paid his second fees installment.  Shortly after \nhe made this payment, Salimon called to tell him that the fees had been reduced to 600,000 \nrupees (approximately $12,960). \n411.  Just before Varkey left for the United States, Varkey traveled to Dewan's office in \nMumbai, where he paid his final installment.  Dewan told Varkey that $3 per hour would be \ndeducted from his paycheck for room and board.  Dewan  also informed Varkey that his H-2B \nvisa would have to be extended for an additional nine months before the green card processing \ncould begin.  He said that when Varkey's green card had been processed, he would return to \nIndia, after which he could go back to the United States with his family. \n412.  Dewan's staff also required Varkey to sign English-language documents and \nreturn all documents relating to the green card opportunity he had been promised.  They refused \nto explain to Varkey what he was signing.  The office was crowded, Varkey felt rushed, and he \n87 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 91 of 106\nknew that he would not receive a refund if he refused to sign.  Only after Varkey had paid his \nfinal fee installment, signed the English-language documents, and given Dewan the documents \nrelating to green cards did he receive his passport. \n413.  In the United States, Varkey felt that he had no choice but to live in Signal's man \ncamp because Signal would deduct $35 per day from his paycheck even ifhe lived outside of the \ncamp.  In addition, Varkey was afraid to leave his job because of his substantial debts.  He knew \nthat if he returned to India, he would not be able to repay the loans. \n414.  Varkey relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, \nVarkey felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nShahi Vijayan \n415.  In or about March or April 2006, Vijayan saw a newspaper advertisement placed \nby Dewan Consultants offering the opportunity to obtain permanent residency in the United \nStates.  Vijayan called Dewan Consultants, and an employee invited him to an informational \nmeeting. \n416.  Dewan, Salimon, Burnett, and two Signal representatives attended the meeting. \nDewan explained that if workers waited for their green cards before traveling to the United \nStates, they would have to wait eighteen months.  However, ifthey traveled to the United States \non H-2B visas, they could leave in six months.  Their green cards would be processed between \nthree to six months after the workers arrived in the United States.  Dewan explained that Signal \n88 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 92 of 106\nwould be responsible for this process.  He said that the total cost would be 800,000 rupees \n(approximately $18,280). \n417.  Signal's representatives provided the company's website address at the meeting. \nVijayan reviewed the website and felt that Signal looked reputable. \n418.  At this time, Vijayan also had an opportunity to work in Australia.  He mentioned \nthis to Dewan, who assured him that working for Signal would guarantee Vijayan's permanent \nresidency and allow him to bring his family to the United States.  Salimon also assured Vijayan \nthat Signal was an excellent company.  Based on Salimon's assurances, Vijayan refused the job \nin Australia. \n419.  Vijayan paid the fees demanded in approximately four installments.  In order to \nraise the money, he mortgaged his house and land at 12.5 percent interest.  He also sold his \nwife's gold jewelry and used her wedding necklace as collateral to obtain another loan at 12.5 \npercent interest.  Vijayan borrowed the remainder of the money from private lenders who \ncharged high interest rates. \n420.  In or about August 2006, Vijayan met with Burnett and made payments to Burnett \nand Pol.  At that meeting, Burnett guaranteed Vijayanthat he would receive a green card if he \nworked for Signal. \n421.  Just before Vijayan's flight to America, he traveled to Dewan's office in Mumbai. \nDewan's employees required him to sign some documents in English, which Vijayan did not \nspeak well.  Vijayan did not fully understand the documents.  Dewan's employees nonetheless \nrushed Vijayan and refused to give him his passport until he paid his final installment fees and \nsigned the documents.  Vijayan felt intimidated.  He saw people crying because they did not have \n89 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 93 of 106\nenough money to make their final payment and Dewan had refused to give them their passports. \nVijayan signed the paperwork. \n422.  When Vijayan arrived in the United States, Signal also required Vijayan to sign \nEnglish-language documents that he did not understand. \n423.  Upon arrival in Pascagoula, Vijayan learned for the first time that the company \nwould deduct $35 from his paycheck each day for room and board, even ifhe chose not to live at \nthe man camp.  Vijayan felt compelled to live and work at Signal because he was afraid of being \nsent back to India, where he would be unable to repay his debts.  Vijayan also stayed because \nSignal personnel convinced him during conversations that he could receive a green card if he \nremained. \n424.  Vijayan relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, \nVijayan felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nJohn Yohannan \n425.  In or about May 2006, Yohannan saw a newspaper advertisement that Dewan \nConsultants had placed, offering the opportunity to work in the United States and obtain a green \ncard.  Yohannan called Dewan Consultants' local office and scheduled a meeting. \n426.  At that meeting, Yohannan met with Salimon, who told Yohannan that he could \nwork for Signal, obtain a green card after working for one year, and earn a good salary.  Salimon \nalso told Yohannan that Signal was a reputable company. \n90 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 94 of 106\n427.  Shortly after that meeting, Yohannan took and passed a welding test administered \nby Michael Pol and a Signal employee.  Pol and the Signal employee told Y ohannan to contact \nSalimon's office.  When Yohannan contacted the office, Salimon repeated his earlier promise \nthat Y ohannan would receive a green card. \n428.  Yohannan later attended a larger meeting, where Pol, Salimon, and Dewan again \nstated that Signal was a reputable American company and that Yohannan and other workers \ncould obtain a green card and U.S. citizenship.  They told Yohannan that he would earn $18 per \nhour at Signal and receive food and housing.  Pol, Salimon, and Dewan did not mention H-2B \nvisas or any paycheck deductions. \n429.  In or about August 2006, Yohannan met with Pol, Burnett, Dewan, and Salimon \nbefore his interview with the U.S. consulate.  They emphasized that if the consulate asked \nYohannan anything about the fees he had paid for his recruitment, he should say that he paid \nnothing. \n430.  Yohannan ultimately paid Dewan, Pol, and Burnett approximately 11,500 rupees \n(approximately $25,000) for this opportunity.  To pay for these fees, Yohannan used his savings \nand took out loans at a 12 percent interest rate.  He secured some of these loans by pledging his \nwife's jewelry as collateral. \n431.  Just before Yohannan flew to the United States, he met with Dewan in his \nMumbai office.  Dewan refused to give Y ohannan his passport and airline ticket until Yohannan \npaid the remaining balance of his fees. Dewan demanded that Y ohannan quickly sign various \ndocuments, but he rushed Yohannan and did not give him enough time to read them.  Feeling \nrushed and anxious to get to the airport in time for his flight, Yohannan signed the documents. \n91 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 95 of 106\n432.  In the United States, Yohannan learned that Signal would deduct approximately \n$260 each week from his paycheck for room and board. \n433.  Yohannan and other Indian workers asked Sanders and other Signal employees \nwhen they would receive their green cards.  The Signal employees told them that Signal would \napply for their green cards at the appropriate time. \n434.  Yohannan relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency and good \nworking conditions and would not have sold assets, incurred substantial debt, or agreed to work \nfor Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Based on his fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, his need to repay the substantial debt and interest he had incurred to pay Defendants' \n\"recruitment fees,\" his fear that Signal would confiscate even more of his hard-earned wages, \nand his fear that Signal or Burnett would institute adverse immigration action against him, \nY ohannan felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to continue working for Signal. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nTHE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT (\"TVPRA\") OF \n2003 \nForced Labor (18 U.S.C. ยง 1589) and Trafficking with Respect to Peonage, Slavery, Involuntary \nServitude, or Forced Labor (18 U.S.c. ยง 1590) \n435.  Each Plaintiffre-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n436.  Each Plaintiff brings this claim against all Defendants. \n437.  Each Plaintiff is authorized to bring these civil claims against all Defendants \npursuant to the civil remedies provisions of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1595. \n438.  Defendants Signal, Dewan, Burnett, and Pol attempted to and did subject each \nPlaintiff to forced labor in violation of 18 U.S.c. ยง 1589. \n92 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 96 of 106\n439.  Defendant Signal employed Plaintiffs in dangerous conditions at a guarded and \ngated man camp, and all Defendants falsely assured Plaintiffs that if they continued to work, \nSignal would assist them in applying for and receiving green cards.  Defendants controlled \nPlaintiffs' housing, food, access to medical care, and other basic needs, and if Plaintiffs did not \ncontinue working for Signal, they would have been cut offfrom those needs. \n440.  Furthermore, the substantial \"recruitment fees\" that Defendants coerced Plaintiffs \ninto paying forced Plaintiffs to work at Signal to payoff their substantial debts. \n441.  Defendants knowingly attempted to and did physically restrain and/or threaten \neach Plaintiff with serious harm in order to obtain the labor and services of each Plaintiff in \nviolation of 18 U.S.c. ยง1589(1). \n442.

Defendants' scheme to isolate Plaintiffs, coerce them to live in conditions causing \npsychological harm, and limit their outside contacts, which included unlawful discrimination in \nviolation of 42 U .S.C. ยง 1981, was designed to convince Plaintiffs that they would suffer serious \nharm if they were to leave the employ of Signal. \n444.  Defendants threatened not to extend Plaintiffs' H-2B visas, not to sponsor \nPlaintiffs for green cards, to deport Plaintiffs, and to send them back to India if they complained \nabout conditions at Signal, and also deceived Plaintiffs about the terms of their immigration \nstatus, each in a manner that constitutes an abuse of the legal process under 18 U.S.c. ยง 1589(3). \n93 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 97 of 106\nDefendants retaliated against Plaintiffs when they sought legal advice regarding their rights and \nimmigration status. \n445.

In violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1590, and in addition to the violations of 18 U.S.C. ยง \n1589 set forth above, Defendants knowingly recruited, transported, harbored and/or obtained the \nPlaintiffs for labor or services in furtherance of Defendants' violations of the following \nprovisions of Title 18, Chapter 77 of the U.S. Code: \na.  enticing, persuading, or inducing the Plaintiffs to board an airliner and to \ntravel to various locations throughout India and the United States, with the intent that they may \nbe made or held in modern-day slavery, violating 18 U.S.c. ยง 1583; \nb.  knowingly and willfully holding Plaintiffs to involuntary servitude, as \ndefined by the TVPRA, 22 U.S.c. ยง7l02(5)(a) and (b), thereby violating 18 U.S.c. ยง 1584; \nc.  removing, confiscating, or possessing Plaintiffs' and other class members' \npassports and other immigration documents in the course of violating, or with the intent to \nviolate 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1583, 1584, \\589, and 1590, thereby violating 18 U.S.C. ยง 1592(a); and \nd.  attempting to violate 18 U.S.C. ยงยง \\583, 1584, 1589, and \\590, thereby \nviolating 18 U.S.C. ยง 1594(a). \n447.  Defendants' actions evince malice and/or reckless indifference towards Plaintiffs. \n448.  As a proximate result ofthe conduct of Defendants, Plaintiffs have suffered \ninjuries to their persons, businesses, and property, as well as other damages.

Each Plaintiffre-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n450.  Each Plaintiff asserts this claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981 for declaratory \nrelief and damages against Defendant Signal. \n451.  The actions of Defendant Signal, as set forth herein, violated Plaintiffs' rights to \nreceive full and equal benefit of all laws as guaranteed by 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981, including Plaintiffs' \nrights to enjoy and benefit from non-discriminatory employment relationships with Defendant \nSignal. \n452.  Specifically, Defendant Signal subjected Plaintiffs to discriminatory and offensive \nmandatory room and board arrangements at Signal man camps in Pascagoula.  Defendant Signal \ndid not subject its employees of non-Indian race, ethnicity, or alienage to the same or similar \nroom and board arrangements. \n453.  As set forth in the preceding paragraphs, Defendant Signal also imposed \ndiscriminatory job-related requirements and adverse terms and conditions of employment to \nwhich its employees of non-Indian race, ethnicity, or alienage were not similarly subject. \n454.  As set forth in the preceding paragraphs, Defendant Signal also created and \nfostered a discriminatory work environment in which Indian workers were subjected to anti-\nIndian invectives throughout the time Plaintiffs were employed, and in which Signal forced Sikh \n95 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 05/21/13   Page 99 of 106\nworkers to shave religiously mandated beards.  Signal employees of non-Indian race, ethnicity, \nor alienage or not ofthe Sikh religion were not subjected to a similar work environment. \n455.  As set forth in the preceding paragraphs, through the actions and statements of its \npersonnel referring to and/or directed at Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers, Defendant \nSignal maintained an objectively hostile and abusive work environment on account of Plaintiffs' \nrace, ethnicity, religion, and alienage throughout the time Plaintiffs were employed. \n456.  As set forth in the preceding paragraphs, Defendant Signal's discriminatory and \noffensive treatment of Plaintiffs was sufficiently severe that it created a hostile work \nenvironment in violation of 42 U .S.C. ยง 1981 throughout the time Plaintiffs were employed. \n457.  Plaintiffs reasonably perceived their work environment to be hostile, abusive, and \ndiscriminatory on the basis of their race, ethnicity, religion, and alienage. \n458.  Defendant Signal's hostile, abusive, and discriminatory treatment of Plaintiffs and \nother class members was unwelcome. \n459.  Defendant Signal knowingly, willfully, maliciously, intentionally, and without \njustification acted to deprive Plaintiffs of their rights. \n460.  Defendants' actions evince malice and/or reckless indifference towards Plaintiffs. \n461.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' knowing, willing, and intentional \nactions, each Plaintiffs has been injured, and is entitled to recover compensatory and punitive \ndamages in an amount to be proven at trial, including attorneys' fees. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION \n462.

CIVIL ACTION\nVERSUS NO. 08-1220\n    \nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL, L.L.C, ET AL. SECTION  \"E\" (3)\nRELATED CASE:\nLAKSHMANAN PNNAYAN ACHARI, ET AL.

SECTION \"E\" (3)\nRELATES TO: 08-1220, 13-6218\nORDER\nOn August 27, 2014, the Motion to Quash Signal's Bank Records Subpoenas [Doc. #1709]\nin Civil Action No. 08-1220 (David) and the Motion to Quash Signal's Bank Records Subpoenas\n[Doc. #299]  in Civil Action No. 13-6218 A(chari) came on for oral hearing before the undersigned. \nPresent were Eben Colby on behalf of the Chakkiyattil plaintiffs, Meredith Stewart on behalf of the\nDavid plaintiffs, and Mitchell Hasenkampf and Elham Rabbani on behalf of Signal International,\nL.L.C.  After the oral hearing, the Court took the motions under advisement.  Having reviewed the\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 345   Filed 09/16/14   Page 2 of 6\nmotions, the oppositions, and the case law, the Court rules as follows.\nI. Background\nThis Court has oft repeated the factual abckground of this lawsuit in earlier orderss, ee David\nv. Signal Int'l, L.L.C., Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 WL 4344540 (E.D. La. Sept. 21, 2012), and will\nnot do so again.  The background of the related cases is near-identical to that of David.\nII. Law and Analysis\nDefendant Signal International, L.L.C. (\"Signal\") served subpoenas on both Capital One and\nMerchant & Marines (\"M&M\") banks, seeking the personal bank records of hundreds of indviiduals,\nincluding the plaintiffs in the David and Achari cases.  \nPlaintiffs contend that the subpoenas are notc ompliant with Louisiana law for two reasons. \nCiting Louisiana Revised Statute ยง6:333(C)(2), they first argue that the subpoenas failed to include\nthe required affidavit in which the subpoenaing paryt attests that a copy of the subpoena was served\non each customer whose records are sought.  Plaintiffs also maintain that service was not made at\nleast fifteen business days before the return dat.e  The return dates on the subpoenas were only eight\ndays after service.\nCiting case law, plaintiffs ask the Court toq uash the subpoenas and order Signal to comply\nwith Louisiana law. \nSignal has withdrawn its subpoena to Capital One.  The only one in dispute is thus the one\npropounded to M&M.  Signal maintains that because plaintiffs allege financial coercion โ even that\nSignal directed M&M to not release funds from plainitffs' own bank accounts to them โ it has the\nright to discover how plaintiffs purchased new  cars, took cross-country vacations and purchased\nother luxuries.  \n2\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 345   Filed 09/16/14   Page 3 of 6\nCiting Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45, Signal contends that the only ground on which\nplaintiffs may move to quash the subpoenas is th at they require the disclosure of privileged or\nprotected matter.  Signal notes that plaintiffs make no substantive objections to the subpoena.\nSignal also argues that plaintiffs can not rely on Section 6:333, which specifically excludes\nfrom the statute's scope any bank that is neither dom iciled in, nor having its principal  place of\nbusiness in, nor engaging in the business of banking in Louisiana. Signal notes that there is no\ndispute that M&M bank does not operate in Louisiana and is based in Pascagoula, Mississippi. \nEven were the statute to apply, Signal argues taht the Court must apply Louisiana's conflict-\nof-laws provisions.  Under that analysis, Mississippi has the greater interest in the application o fits\nown laws.   \nPlaintiffs note that Section 6:333 provides an alternative definition for a \"bank\":  \"'Bank'\nshall also mean a savings bank, a savings and loan association, a company issuing credit cards, or\nany other business offering credit.\"  Because M&M issues credit cards and offers credit, plaintiffs\nargue that Section 6:333 applies to it.\nPlaintiffs also contend that Louisiana's interest in providing notice to individuals whose\nbanks records have been subpoenaed does not conflitc with Mississippi law.  Because Louisiana law\ndoes not per se prevent the production of bank records (only requiring notice and an opportunity to\nobject), plaintiffs maintain that there is no conflict with Mississippi law.\nEven if there were, plaintiffs argue, Louisian a has an interest in enforcing its bank laws. \nThey note that here, a Louisiana law firm, acting under the authority of a Louisiana-based court, has\ncompelled the production of bank records to a Louisiaan address.  They thus contend that Louisiana\nhas an interest in enforcing the 15-day notice to individuals.\n3\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 345   Filed 09/16/14   Page 4 of 6\nPlaintiffs also maintain that the subpoenas aer overbroad.  They note that the subpoenas seek\nproduction of every single banking record related toh undreds of individuals.  They contend that the\nrequest is all based on the testimony of one individual, Hemant Khuttan, who testified that he bought\na car and that he believes that others had done so as well.  Plaintiffs argue that they had no access\nto public transportation to obtain necessities.  Som e employees thus pooled m oney together to\npurchase a car.  They contend that this hardly constitutes \"luxuries.\"\nPlaintiffs maintain that exploring hundreds ofi ndividuals' bank records for a period of years\nis not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  They argue that Signal\nshould be required to specify what information it seeks.  Plaintiffs also ask that they be allowed to\nreview the information first to redact personal identifying and financial information. \nFor the following reasons, the Court grants them  otions in part.  Rule 26(b)(1) provides that\nโ[p]arties may obtain discovery regarding any non-privileged matter that is relevant to any party's\nclaim or defense.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P .26(b)(1). The rule specifies tha tโ[r]elevant information need not\nbe admissible at the trial if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of\nadmissible evidence.โ Id.  The discovery rules are accorded a broad and liberal treatment to achieve\ntheir purpose of adequately informing litigants in civil trials. Hebert v. Lando, 441 U.S. 153, 176\n(1979).  Nevertheless, discovery does have โultimate and necessary boundaries.โ   Oppenheimer\nFund, Inc. v. Sanders, 437 U.S. 340, 351 (1978) (quoting Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 507\n(1947)).  Further, โit is well established that the scope of discovery is within the sound discretion\nof the trial court.โ  Coleman v. Am. Red Cross, 23 F.3d 1091, 1096 (6th Cir. 1994).\n4\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 345   Filed 09/16/14   Page 5 of 6\nRule 45 governs the issuance of subpoenas, and provides that on timely motion, the issuing\ncourt must quash or modify a subpoena if it requires disclosure of privileged or  other protected\nmatter, or otherwise subjects the subpoenaed person to undue burden.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(c)(3).\nUnder Rule 45(c)(1), โ[a] party or attorney repsonsible for issuing and serving a subpoena must take\nreasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a person subject to the subpoena.โ\nFed. R. Civ. P. 45(c)(1).\nThe Court first pretermits the question of whether Louisiana or Mississippi law applies. \nWhether M&M is a \"bank\" under the second definition of Section 6:333 is a merits determination\nfor the District Court.  Even were this Court to so hold, however, quashing the subpoenas at this\npoint and on thi s ground would be no m ore than an  exercise in formality.  At this point in the\nlitigation, plaintiffs have had more than 15 days to object to the subpoenas, which they have done\nin their motion and in their reply.\nPlaintiffs argue only that the subpoenas areo verbroad; M&M does not make this argument. \nWhile the subpoenas seek bank records for hundreds of individuals, the Court finds that the time\nframes are limited and, with regard to some individuals, mere days or months.  However, the Court\nconcludes that at this late stage of the litigation,1 the best course of action here is to order Signal to\nre-propound the subpoenas and lim it them at this time to the named plaintiffs in the  David and\nAchari lawsuits.  The return date shall be fifteen (15) days from the date of service.  The Court\nalso orders Signal to make the return of the documents on counsel for plaintiffs.  This will allow\nplaintiffs to redact the documents, should circumstances so warrant, of irrelevant and/or personal\n1\nAugust 8, 2014 โ the date on which plaintiffs filed their motions โ was the discovery\ndeadline.\n5\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 345   Filed 09/16/14   Page 6 of 6\ninformation in line with the num erous protective orders in these lawsuits.  Plaintiffs shall do so\nwithin fifteen (15) days of receipt of the documents  and shall then produce the docum ents to\nSignal.\nIII. Conclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons,\nIT IS ORDERED that the Motion to Quash Signasl' Bank Records Subpoenas [Doc. #1709]\nin Civil Action No. 08-1220 and the Motion tQo uash Signal's Bank Records Subpoenas [Doc. #299]\nin Civil Action No. 13-6218 are GRANTED IN PART as outlined above.\nNew Orleans, Louisiana, this 16th day of September, 2014.\n                                                                       \n DANIEL E.

The Equal Opportunity Employment Commission (EEOC) and some 190-plus\nindividual  plaintiffsโtogether  comprising  all  the  plaintiffs  in  the  twelve  actions  on  the\nmotionโoppose centralization. \nOn the basis of the papers filed and hearing session held, we will deny plaintiffsโ motion. \nAlthough these actions share some factual questions arising out of the alleged fraudulent scheme to\ntraffick plaintiffs into the United States to work at Signalโs facilities and the terms and conditions of\nemployment after they were hired by Signal, we are not persuaded that Section 1407 centralization\nis necessary either to assure the convenience of the parties and witnesses or for the just and efficient\nconduct of this litigation.  As both of the underlying courts have recognized, each individual plaintiff\nmust prove how he was recruited, the abuse he allegedly suffered while working for Signal, and the\ndamages caused to him by the alleged fraudulent scheme and discriminatory work conditions.  These\nindividualized facts very well may predominate over the common factual issues alleged by plaintiffs. \nMore significantly, all of the actions are progressing rapidly towards trial.  Jury trial of the\nMississippi plaintiffsโ claims in the first-filed David action in the Eastern District of Louisiana is\nscheduled for January of 2015.  Fact discovery in the first two actions filed in the Eastern District of\nTexas will close in less than two months, and trials in those actions are also set for early- to mid-\n* Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle took no part in the decision of this matter.\n\nCase C2a:1s3e- cMvD-0L6 2N1o8. -2S5M5-4D  E DKo  c uDmoceunmt 7e6n t   3F0il4e d   F0i8le/1d2 0/184/1  2 P/1a4g e   P2a ogfe 3 2 of 3\n-2-\n2015.  Much, if not all, of the โcommonโ factual discovery undoubtedly has been completed already,\nas more than a hundred daysโ worth of depositions have been conducted. \nFurthermore, there has been substantial inter-district and intra-district coordination.  All seven\nof the Louisiana actions have been assigned to Judge Susie Morgan, who has ordered five of the\nactions consolidated (all save the action by the EEOC) and that discovery of all the Louisiana actions\nbe conducted in a coordinated fashion so as to avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts.  Similarly,\nthe Texas actions have been referred to the same magistrate judge.  Consent orders have been entered\nin those actions allowing the Texas plaintiffs full access to the written discovery, document discovery,\nand depositions from the Louisiana actions.  Thus, โinformal cooperation among the involved\nattorneys and coordination between the involved courts seems preferable to formal centralization.โ \nSee In re Adderall XR (Amphetamine/Dextroamphetamine) Mktg., Sales Practices & Antitrust Litig.,\n968 F.

Signal\n1\n\n(13-6218,  13-6219,  13-6220,  13-6221)(the  \"Achari  cases\").1  Plaintiffs  in  the\nChakkiyattil case (13-6219) filed an opposition to the J&M Defendants' motion.2 \nThe J&M Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims in all of the Achari cases for\nfailure  to  state  a  claim,  primarily denying the  factual  allegations  pled  in  Plaintiffs'\ncomplaints.3 Under Rule 12(b)(6), a district court may dismiss a complaint, or any part of\nit, for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted if the plaintiff has not set\nforth factual allegations in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief. Bell Atl.\nCorp. v. Twombly 550 U.S. 554 (2007); Cuvillier v. Taylor, 503 F.3d 397, 401 (5th Cir.\n2007). In assessing the Plaintiffs' complaint, the Court must accept all well-pleaded facts\nas true and liberally construe all factual allegations in the light most favorable to the\nPlaintiffs. Lowry v. Texas A&M Univ. Sys., 117 F.3d 242, 247 (5th Cir. 1997). \nThe Court finds the facts pled in Plaintiffs' complaints are sufficient to support their\nclaims against the J&M Defendants. This Court already denied a similar motion filed by the\nJ&M Defendants seeking to dismiss the Plaintiffs' RICO claim in David v. Signal (08-\n1220)(the \"David case\").4 The Court is not persuaded to reach a contrary decision when the\nfactual allegations in the Achari Plaintiffs' complaints are substantially similar to the\nPlaintiffs' allegations in the David case.  Moreover, for the reasons set forth in the Court's\nOrder and Reasons in the David case on the 12(c) Motion for Partial Judgment on the\nPleadings and 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss filed by Signal and the 12(c) Motion for Partial\n1R.

Signal (13-6218 c/w 13-6219, 13-6220, 13-6221)\nORDER  AND REASONS\nBefore the Court is a Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)1 and a Rule 12(c)\n1R. Doc. 148. All documents cited in this order were filed in the master case, Achari v. Signal (13-\n6218). \n1\n\nMotion for Judgment on the Pleadings both filed by defendant Burnett,2 as well as a Motion\nfor Partial Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) filed by defendant Signal International, LLC\n(\"Signal\").3  Plaintiffs oppose  all of the motions.4 Considering the briefs, the record, and the\nparties arguments at oral argument, the court rules as follows. \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nPlaintiffs are citizens of India who secured visas to work in the United States for\nSignal in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Plaintiffs allege the Defendants recruited\nthem to work as temporary workers at Signal's facilities in Pascagoula, Mississippi.\nPlaintiffs further allege Defendants forced them to pay recruitment fees, as well as\nimmigration  processing  and  travel  expenses.  Plaintiffs  allege  that  throughout  their\nrecruitment,  Defendants  promised  them  permanent  residency in  the  United  States,\nhowever, Defendants never took any steps to assist Plaintiffs in applying for or obtaining\ngreen cards. As a result of Defendants' actions, Plaintiffs claim they were discriminated\nagainst and subjected to forced labor as welders, pipefitters, and marine fabrication workers\nfor Signal. At Signal's facilities, Plaintiffs claim Signal forced the workers to live in\ndeplorable conditions and used various tactics to compel the Plaintiffs to continuing\nworking. \nPlaintiffs originally were a part of a putative class action in David v. Signal (08-\n1220)(the \"David case\"). Plaintiffs are current members of the class of Indian workers on\nwhose behalf the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") brought suit in\n2R. Doc. 228. The Court uses \"Burnett\" to collectively refer to the following defendants: Malvern\nC. Burnett, the Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, LLC and the Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, APC. \n3R. Doc. 150.\n4R. Doc. 159, R. Doc. 160, R. Doc.161, R. Doc. 222, R. Doc. 223, and R. Doc. 238. \n2\n\nEEOC v. Signal (12-557)(the \"EEOC case\").5 After the Court denied class certification in the\nDavid case, putative class members filed four separate actions in the Southern District of\nMississippi.6 On October 24, 2013, the four actions were consolidated and transferred to the\nEastern District of Louisiana.7 These four consolidated cases are collectively referred to\nherein as the Achari cases.  \nIn of each the Achari cases, Plaintiffs allege Signal, Burnett, and Dewan8 violated the\nTrafficking Victims Protection Act of 2003 (\"TVPRA\") and Signal violated the Civil Rights\nAct of 1866 (Section 1981).9 Additionally, Plaintiffs in the Krishnakutty case include claims\nunder the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\") (18 U.S.C. ยง 1962\net seq) and the Klu Klux Klan Act (42 U.S.C. ยง 1985) against Signal, Burnett, and Dewan.10\nPlaintiffs in the Achari cases also allege state law claims for fraudulent misrepresentation,\n5The term \"class\" is used collectively to describe the aggrieved individuals who the EEOC\nrepresents and does not implicate Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.\n6Achari v. Signal (13-6218) (47 former putative class members from the David case), Chakkiyattil\nv. Signal (13-6219) (28 former putative class members), Krishnakutty v. Signal (13-6220) (2 former\nputative class members), Devassy v. Signal (13-6221) (13 former putative class members).\n7R. Doc. 47. A fifth case from the Southern District of Mississippi, Singh v. Signal (14-732) was\ntransferred to the Eastern District of Louisiana on April 24, 2014 and consolidated with the Achari cases.\nR. Doc. 240. These motions were filed before the Singh case was transferred to this Court.\n8The Court uses \"Dewan\" to collectively refer to the following defendants: Global Resources, Inc.,\nDewan Consultants, and Sachin Dewan.\n9See R. Doc. 200 (the Achari complaint); R. Doc. 199 (the Chakkiyattil complaint); R. Doc. 201\n(the Krishnakutty complaint); and R. Doc. 198 (the Devassy complaint). In addition to Signal, Burnett,\nand Dewan, plaintiffs in each case name other defendants. In the Achari case, plaintiffs also name Michael\nPol as a defendant. In the Chakkiyattil case, plaintiffs name Billy Wilks, J&M Associates, Inc., and J&M\nMarine, Inc. as defendants. In the Krishnakutty case, plaintiffs name Indo-Amerisoft, LLC and Kurella\nRao as defendants. In the Devassy case, plaintiffs name Kurella Rao, Indo-Amerisoft, LLC and Michael\nPol as defendants. \n10R. Doc. 201, pp. 46-58. The Krishnakutty plaintiffs also name Kurella Rao and Indo-Amerisoft\nas defendants in their claims under RICO and the Klu Klux Klan Act. \n3\n\nnegligent  misrepresentation,  and  breach  of  contract.11  In  addition,  Plaintiffs  in  the\nKrishnakutty case seek relief for money had and received, and breach of fiduciary duty\nunder Mississippi law.12 \nSignal and Burnett had filed motions to dismiss in the Achari cases before they were\ntransferred from the Southern District of Mississippi and consolidated. Once the Achari\ncases were transferred, this Court ordered counsel for Signal and Burnett to re-file their\nmotions to dismiss with a new submission date.13 Both Signal and Burnett filed a Motion\nto Dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).14 The Plaintiffs in the Achari cases jointly filed oppositions\nto both motions.15 Plaintiffs in the Krishnakutty case filed a separate opposition to Burnett's\nmotion to specifically address the arguments made with respect to their claims.16 \nThe Court thereafter ordered Plaintiffs in each case to file an amended complaint.17\nThe Court also directed Signal and the Burnett Defendants to file supplemental memoranda\nclarifying their intention to reassert their motions to dismiss with respect to the amended\n11Four complaints addressed in these motions (Achari, Chakkiyattil, Krisnakutty, and Devassy)\nbring state law claims under Mississippi law. The complaint in the recently transferred Singh case does\nnot specify the law of which state its state law claims arise under. \n12R. Doc. 201, pp. 65-70.\n13R. Doc. 149. \n14R. Doc. 148, R. Doc. 150. \n15R. Doc. 159, R. Doc. 160. \n16R. Doc. 161.\n17R. Doc. 182. The Court instructed the plaintiffs to file amended and restated complaints\nspecifically setting forth the defendants against which each cause of action is asserted, the specific\ndamages sought under each cause of action, and the statute or other law on which the demand is based. \n4\n\ncomplaints.18 Plaintiffs filed supplemental oppositions to Signal and Burnett's supplemental\nmemoranda.19 Burnett also filed a Rule 12(c) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings,20\nwhich Plaintiffs opposed.21 The Court will consider each motion in turn. \nSTANDARD OF LAW\nThe Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss filed by Signal and Burnett and the Burnett's\n12(c) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings are all governed by the same legal standard.\nThe standard for dismissal under Rule 12(c) is the same as that for dismissal for failure to\nstate a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). Johnson v. Johnson, 385 F.3d 503, 528 (5th Cir. 2004). \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a district court may dismiss a\ncomplaint, or any part of it, for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted if\nthe plaintiff has not set forth factual allegations in support of his claim that would entitle\nhim to relief. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007); Cuvillier v. Taylor, 503\nF.3d 397, 401 (5th Cir. 2007). As the Fifth Circuit explained in Gonzales v. Kay:\n\"Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the\nspeculative level.\" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127\nS.Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). The Supreme Court recently\nexpounded upon the Twombly standard, explaining that \"[t]o survive\na motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual\nmatter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on\nits face.\" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 128 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173\nL.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct.\n1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929). \"A Claim has facial plausibility when the\nplaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the\nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct\n18R.

It follows that \"where the well-pleaded facts do not permit\nthe court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the\ncomplaint has alleged - but it has not 'show[n]' - that the pleader is\nentitled to relief.\" Id. at 1950 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). \n577 F.3d 600, 603 (5th Cir. 2009). \nThe Court cannot look beyond the factual allegations in the pleadings to determine\nwhether relief should be granted. See Spivey v. Robertson, 197 F.3d 772, 774 (5th Cir.\n1999); Baker v. Putnal, 75 F.3d 190, 196 (5th Cir. 1996). In assessing the Plaintiffs'\ncomplaint, the Court must accept all well-pleaded facts as true and liberally construe all\nfactual allegations in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs. Spivey, 197 F.3d at 774;\nLowrey v. Tex A & M Univ. Sys., 117 F.3d 242, 247 (5th Cir. 1997). \"Dismissal is appropriate\nwhen the complaint 'on its face show[s] a bar to relief.\" Cutrer v. McMillan, 308 F. App'x\n819, 820 (5th Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (unpublished) (quoting Clark v. Amoco Prod. Co.,\n794 F.2d 967, 970 (5th Cir. 1986)).  A court may grant a motion for judgment on the\npleadings when no genuine issues of material fact remain and the case can be decided as a\nmatter of law.  Erickson v. Pardus, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007).\nANALYSIS\nA. Signal's Motion to Partially Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim22\nSignal seeks dismissal of Plaintiffs' state law claims, claim for recruitment fees under\n1981, and claim for recruitment fees under the Klu Klux Klan Act. With respect to Plaintiffs'\nstate law claims, Signal argues those claims arise from the Plaintiffs' recruitment abroad to\nwork in the United States, and under Mississippi law, Plaintiffs' claims are implausible.23\nSimilarly, Signal argues Plaintiffs' claims for recruitment fees under Section 1981 and the\n22R. Doc. 150.\n23R. Doc. 150, p. 18. \n6\n\nKlu Klux Klan Act arise out of events occurring abroad and those statutes do not apply\nextraterritorially.24\n1. State Law Claims\nIn each of the Achari cases, Plaintiffs claim that all Defendants promised to secure\nthem permanent residency after their employment with Signal. Plaintiffs allege they paid\nexorbitant \"recruitment fees\" to the Defendants for processing immigration documents, yet\nDefendants failed to secure permanent residency for the Plaintiffs after their arrival in the\nUnited States. Plaintiffs also claim the Defendants misrepresented the nature of Plaintiff's\nemployment and immigration opportunities in the United States. For the Defendants'\nalleged failure to fulfill their promises to secure permanent residency, Plaintiffs assert\nbreach  of  contract  claims  under  Mississippi  law.  For  the  Defendants'  alleged  false\nrepresentations regarding Plaintiffs' opportunities for immigration and employment status,\nPlaintiffs assert fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation claims under Mississippi law.\nSignal argues the facts giving rise to Plaintiffs' state law claims involve Signal's alleged\nwrongdoing abroad. Signal believes the state law claims have a \"foreign basis\" because\nPlaintiffs' recruitment began in either India or the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Signal cites\nto Mississippi's choice-of-law rules to argue the state law claims are implausible because\nMississippi  law  would  not  recognize  claims  arising  from  events  occurring  abroad.\nAdditionally, the Krishnakutty Plaintiffs allege Defendants breached a fiduciary duty to\nPlaintiffs by failing to fulfill promises to obtain permanent residency or by misrepresenting\nPlaintiffs' ability to secure permanent residency.  The basis of the Krishnakutty Plaintiffs'\n24R. Doc. 150, p. 22.\n7\n\nclaims for money had and received is identical.  \nThe questions of which state's choice of law rules apply and which state's substantive\nlaw applies are questions of law for the Court.  These issues have not yet been decided and,\nas a result, Signal is not entitled to dismissal of the Plaintiffs' state law claims because it has\nnot established that the facts as alleged, accepted as true, fail to state a claim to relief that\nis plausible on its face. The Court cannot reasonably infer the defendant is liable or not\nliable for the misconduct alleged unless it knows the applicable law.  Accordingly, Signal's\nmotion to dismiss the Plaintiffs' state law claims is denied. Signal may refile its motion to\ndismiss the state law claims once these choice of law issues have been decided.25\n2. Claims under Section 1981 and the Klu Klux Klan Act\nPlaintiffs allege Signal unlawfully subjected the Plaintiffs to discriminatory terms\nand conditions of employment at Signal's facilities in Pascagoula, Mississippi based on race,\nethnicity, religion and alienage. Plaintiffs assert Signal violated 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981, which\nprohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of race.26 The Krisnakutty Plaintiffs\ninclude a claim under the Klu Klux Klan Act (42 U.S.C. ยง 1985), alleging Defendants\nconspired to deprive Plaintiffs of their Thirteenth Amendment rights to be free from forced\nlabor and involuntary servitude. Signal moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims under Section\n25Because this Court has federal question jurisdiction and is exercising supplemental jurisdiction\nover Plaintiffs' state law claims, the Court must apply the law in the state in which it sits. Erie Railroad Co.\nv. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). This includes the choice-of-law rules of the\nforum state. Klaxon v. Stentor Electric Manufacturing Co., 313 U.S. 487 (1941). When a case is\ntransferred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1404(a), courts apply the choice-of-law rules of the transferor state.\nFerens v. John Deere, 494 U.S. 516, 525 (1990). However, whether the Ferens rule applies to cases\ntransferred pursuant to the first-filed rule, such as this one, is unsettled. Accordingly, it is unclear which\nstate's choice-of-law rules apply to this case, and it is unclear which state's substantive laws apply.  \n26Section 1981 refers to racial discrimination in the making an enforcement of contracts, but the\nstatute has been read to provide a federal remedy against discrimination in employment on the basis of\nrace. See Adams v. McDougal, 695 F.2d 104 (5th Cir. 1983). \n8\n\n1981 and the Klu Klux Klan Act insofar as those claims seek recovery of recruitment fees\npaid abroad. Signal asserts Plaintiffs' recruitment occurred abroad and neither Section 1981\nnor the Klu Klux Klan Act apply extraterritorially. \nPlaintiffs' amended complaints do not seek recovery of recruitment fees under\nSection 1981 or the Klu Klux Klan Act.27 Plaintiffs' claims under Section 1981 are rooted in\nSignal's  alleged  discriminatory  acts  at  Signal's  facility  in  the  United  States.  The\nKrishnakutty Plaintiffs' Klu Klux Klan Act claims relate to Signal's alleged conspiracy to\ndeprive Plaintiffs' Thirteenth Amendment rights at Signal's Facilities in the United States.\nIn contrast, in each of the Plaintiffs' claims under TVPA, the Plaintiffs explicitly pray for\neconomic loss from recruitment fees paid to the Defendants.28 Thus, because the Plaintiffs\ndo not pray for recruitment fees under its Section 1981 or Klu Klux Klan Act claims, Signal's\nmotion to dismiss those claims is moot. \n27In the Achari case, Plaintiffs seek: \"compensatory damages (including, without limitation, loss of\nwages, loss of opportunity, pain and suffering, mental and emotional distress, prejudgment interest, and\nadditional economic loss from (1) medical expenses; (2) damages related to living and working conditions;\nand (3) mandatory housing and other fees paid to Signal), punitive damages, attorneys' fees in an amount\nto be proven at trial.\" See R. Doc. 200, p. 149. Plaintiffs in the Krishnakutty case seek: \"lost and unpaid\nwages, lost opportunities, pain and suffering (including emotional distress and humiliation), out-of-pocket\nexpenses, and other pecuniary losses including loss of property and/or business.\" See R. Doc. 201, p. 57.\nPlaintiffs in the Chakkiyatil case seek \"[C]ompensatory damages [including] housing fees paid to Signal\nand other charges made by Signal, adverse terms and conditions of employment resulting from\ndiscrimination (including underpayment of wages), pain, suffering, medical costs and lost wages resulting\nfrom on-the-job physical injuries related to discriminatory working conditions, damages related to living\nand working conditions, and damages suffered due to mental and emotional distress, as well as\nopportunity costs, out-of-pocket costs, and other pecuniary losses.\" See R. Doc. 199, p. 116. Plaintiffs in the\nDevassy case seek damages including: \"housing fees paid to Signal and other charges made by Signal,\nadverse terms and conditions of employment resulting from discrimination (including underpayment of\nwages), pain, suffering, medical costs and lost wages resulting from on-the-job physical injuries related to\ndiscriminatory working conditions, damages related to living and working conditions, and damages\nsuffered due to mental and emotional distress, as well as opportunity costs, out-of-pocket costs, and other\npecuniary damages.\" See R. Doc. 198, p. 72.\n28For example, in the Achari case, Plaintiffs pray for \"economic loss from recruitment and visa\nfees paid to Defendants.\" R. Doc. 200, p. 147. In the Chakkiyatil case, Plaintiffs pray for \"compensatory\nand punitive damages ... including recruitment fees.\" R. Doc. 199, p. 114. In the Devassy case, Plaintiffs\npray for \"compensatory and punitive damages, including recruitment fees...\" R. Doc. 198, p. 70.  \n9\n\nAccordingly, for the above stated reasons, Signal's 12(b)(6) Motion to Partially\nDismiss is DENIED as to the Plaintiffs' state law claims and DENIED AS MOOT as to\nclaims for recruiting fees under Section 1981 and the Klu Klux Klan Act. \nB. Burnett's 12(b)(6) Motion29\nBurnett  moves  to  dismiss  the  entirety  of  Plaintiffs'  complaints,  arguing  the\ncomplaints only allege \"unsupported and unsupportable conclusions\" as to all Defendants,\nand do not include factual material sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Burnett\nadditionally asserts Plaintiffs have not pled the allegations of fraud with the specificity\nrequired under Rule 9. With respect to Plaintiffs' state law claims, Burnett argues the acts\nalleged to form the basis of those claims occurred in India and the United Arab Emirates\nand are thus implausible under Mississippi law. Finally, Burnett argues Plaintiffs' state law\nclaims are barred by the passing of the statute of limitations.\n1. Sufficiency of Factual Material Alleged\na. TVPA Claims\nBurnett argues Plaintiffs' complaints lack factual allegations sufficient to state a\nclaim under the TVPA.  Burnett asserts Plaintiffs do not allege that Burnett ever forced\nPlaintiffs to work for Signal or ever threatened any Plaintiff with deportation if they refused\nto  continue  working  for  Signal.  Burnett  believes  he  provided  legal  and  necessary\nimmigration services to allow Plaintiffs to enter the United States. \nPlaintiffs' complaints include two related claims under the TVPA: a claim for forced\nlabor under 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589 (\"Section 1589\"), and a claim for trafficking under 18 U.S.C.\n29R. Doc. 148.\n10\n\nยง 1590 (\"Section 1590\"). Under 18 U.S.C. ยง 1595 (\"Section 1595\"), an individual who is a\nvictim of a violation under the TVPA  may bring a civil action against anyone who\n\"knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value from participation in a\nventure which that person know or should have known has engaged in an act in violation\nof [the TVPA].\" 18 U.S.C. ยง 1595. \nPlaintiffs seek relief under Section 1589, which prohibits anyone who \"knowingly\nprovides or obtains the labor or services of a person by any one of, or by any combination\nof, the following means: (1) by means of force, threats of force, physical restraint, or threats\nof physical restraint to that person or another person; (2) by means of serious harm or\nthreats of serious harm to that person or another person; (3) by means of the abuse or\nthreatened abuse of law or legal process; or (4) by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern\nintended to cause the person to believe that, if that person did not perform such labor or\nservices, that person or another person would suffer serious harm or restraint.\" 18 U.S.C.\nยง 1589.\nPlaintiffs allege Burnett placed advertisements and conducted seminars in Indian\ncities to recruit workers for Signal, promising \"employment based green cards\" and\npermanent residency in the United States.30 Plaintiffs' claim Burnett promised them green\ncards in order to induce Plaintiffs to pay large fees to travel and work in the United States.31\nPlaintiffs allege Burnett never took any steps to apply for permanent residency for the\nPlaintiffs.32 Based on their \"need to repay the substantial debt and interest [they] incurred\"\n30See, e.g., R. Doc. 200, pp. 21-22. \n31Id. at p. 22. \n32Id. at p. 23. \n11\n\nto pay Burnett's recruitment fees, Plaintiffs allege they felt \"intimidated into acquiescence\nand compelled to continue working for Signal.\"33 Plaintiffs allegations are sufficient to state\na claim under Section 1589(a)(2) for using \"serious harm\" to provide or obtain Plaintiffs'\nlabor.34\nUnder Section 1589(c)(2), \"serious harm\" includes financial harm \"that is sufficiently\nserious ... to compel a reasonable person .. to perform or to continue performing labor\nservices in order to avoid incurring that harm.\" Courts have found that threats of being in\ndebt and being unable to repay those debts constitutes \"serious harm\" sufficient to survive\na motion to dismiss. See Nunag-Tanedo v. East Baton Rouge Parish School Bd., 790 F.\nSupp. 2d 1134 (C.D. Cal. 2011); Panwar v. Access Therapies, Inc., 2013 WL 5486783 (S.D.\nInd. Sept. 30, 2013). Because Plaintiffs have alleged Burnett induced them into incurring\nsubstantial debts and Plaintiffs felt compelled to continue working to repay those debts,\nPlaintiffs' complaints contain sufficient facts to state a claim under Section 1589(a)(2). \nPlaintiffs also allege Burnett violated Section 1590 of the TVPA. Section 1590\nprovides a claim against any person who \"knowingly recruits, harbors, transports, provides,\nor obtains by any means, any person for labor or services in violation of this chapter...\" 18\nU.S.C. ยง 1590. The violations of Section 1589 are included in the chapter for violations of\nSection 1590. Thus, because Plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts to state a claim under\nSection 1589, Plaintiffs have also pled sufficient facts to state a claim under Section 1590\nagainst Burnett as a person who recruited Plaintiffs for labor in violation of Section 1589.\n33See, e.g., r. Doc. 200, p. 85. \n34As Plaintiffs point out in their original opposition, their allegations are also likely sufficient to\nstate a claim under Section 1589(a)(3) for using \"abuse of the legal process\" to provide Plaintiffs' labor. \n12\n\nSee Nunag-Tanedo, 790 F. Supp. 2d at 1147 (\"Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that\nDefendants are involved in a fraudulent scheme involving forced labor, and with the\nintentional nature of this matter Plaintiffs have also sufficiently alleged that Defendants\nrecruited, transported, and provided Plaintiffs for that forced labor.\").\nIn sum, Plaintiffs claims under the TVPA are sufficiently supported by factual\nallegations in each complaint. Burnett insists his actions were \"consistent with what would\nhappen in the ordinary course of events in representing non-immigrant workers recruited\nfor work in the United States.\"35 However, Burnett's disagreement over the version of the\nfacts alleged in Plaintiffs' complaints is insufficient to support a motion to dismiss. The\nCourt must accept all factual allegations in Plaintiffs' complaints as true, and Burnett has\nfailed to show Plaintiffs' claims under the TVPA should be dismissed. \nb. State Law Claims\nBurnett  also  argues  Plaintiffs'  complaint  does  not  set  forth  sufficient  factual\nallegations to support their state law claims for fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent\nmisrepresentation, and breach of contract. Burnett asserts the facts alleged demonstrate\na \"fulfillment of Burnett's obligations to the Plaintiffs.\"\nAs explained above, the questions of which state's choice of law rules apply and\nwhich state's substantive laws apply have not yet been decided. As a result, Burnett is not\nentitled to dismissal of the Plaintiffs' state law claims because he has not established that\nthe facts as alleged, accepted as true, fail to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. \nThe Court does find that Plaintiffs have satisfied Rule 9(b)'s requirement of pleading fraud\n35R. Doc. 148, p. 6. \n13\n\nwith particularity. Accordingly, Burnett's motion to dismiss the Plaintiffs' state law claims\nis denied. Burnett may refile his motion to dismiss the state law claims, to the extent that\nit is not based on Rule 9(b), once choice of law issues have been decided. \n2. Extraterritoriality\nBurnett moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' state law claims by briefly putting forth the same\nargument as Signal. That is, because a portion of the facts giving rise to Plaintiffs' state law\nclaims occurred abroad, Burnett argues those claims should be brought under the laws of\nIndia or the UAE. Burnett asserts Plaintiffs' complaint does not show a remedy exists under\nIndian law, thus Plaintiffs' state law claims should be dismissed. \nAs explained above, the questions of which state's choice of law rules apply and\nwhich state's substantive laws apply have not yet been decided. As a result, Burnett is not\nentitled to dismissal of the Plaintiffs' state law claims because he has not established that\nthe facts as alleged, accepted as true, fail to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. \nAccordingly, Burnett's motion to dismiss the Plaintiffs' state law claims is denied. Burnett\nmay refile his motion to dismiss the state law claims once choice of law issues have been\ndecided. \n3. Statute of Limitations\nLastly, Burnett seeks dismissal of Plaintiffs' state law claims for fraud, negligent\nmisrepresentation  and breach of  contract  asserting  the  statute  of  limitations  under\nMississippi law ran by March 8, 2011.36  \nAs explained above, the questions of which state's choice of law rules apply and\n36R. Doc. 148-1, p. 7. \n14\n\nwhich state's substantive laws apply have not yet been decided. As a result, Burnett is not\nentitled to dismissal of the Plaintiffs' state law claims because he has not established that\nthe facts as alleged, accepted as true, fail to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. \nAccordingly, Burnett's motion to dismiss the Plaintiffs' state law claims is denied. Burnett\nmay refile his motion to dismiss the state law claims once choice of law issues have been\ndecided. \nC. Burnett's 12(c) Motion37\nBurnett filed a Rule 12(c) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings in Achari v. Signal\n(13-6218) seeking to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims based on the same grounds as his Rule\n12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss. For the reasons discussed above, Burnett has not carried his\nburden  of  showing  dismissal  is  warranted.  Accordingly,  Burnett's  12(c)  Motion  for\nJudgment on the Pleadings is DENIED. \nCONCLUSION\nFor the above-stated reasons, IT IS ORDERED that Signal's 12(b)(6) Motion for\nPartial Dismissal be and hereby is DENIED as to the Plaintiffs' state law claims and\nDENIED AS MOOT as to claims for recruiting fees under Section 1981 and the Klu Klux\nKlan Act.  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Burnett's Rule 12(b)(6) Motion for Partial\nDismissal be and hereby is DENIED. \nIT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  Burnett's  Rule  12(c)  Motion  for  Partial\nJudgment on the Pleadings be and hereby is DENIED. \n37R.

Signal (13-6218, 13-6219, 13-6220, 13-6221, 14-732) \n     \n   \nORDER AND REASONS \n  Before the Court is a Motion to Certify  for Interlocutory Appeal or Alternatively \nto Stay P ending Application for Mandamus Relie f filed by Defendants Signal \n1 \n \n\nInternational, L.L.C., Signal International, Inc., and Signal Inter national Texas, G.P. \n(collectively \"Signal\") .1  Defendants Malvern Burnett, the Law Offices of Malver n \nBurnett, A.P.C., and Gulf Coast Immigr ation Law Center, L.L.C. (the \"Burnett \nDefendants\") have filed a similar Motion.2  The question presented is whether the Court \nshould certify for int erlocutory appeal its  orders prohibiting th e discovery of certain \npost-Signal information, including immigration status.  For the fo llowing reasons, the  \nCourt finds that the  criteria for interlocutory appeal are not present and that a  \ndiscretionary stay pe nding the outcome of a petition for mandamus relief is not \nwarranted.  The Motions are DENIED. \nBACKGROUND3 \n   A protective order in the above-caption ed matters prohibits Signal from \ndiscovering,  inter alia , the current immigration status of any plaintiff, the curren t \naddress or place of residence of any plaintiff, and the employers or potential employers \nof any plaintiff post-termination of employment with Signal.4 Moving Defendants argue \nthe protective order u nduly restricts their  ability to discover impeachment evidence. 5  \nThe Court has rejected this argument on multiple occasions, finding t hat the  in \nterrorem effect of producing the requested information outweighs Signal's interest in  \nunbridled discovery.  Recognizing the futi lity of beating a dead hor se, Moving  \nDefendants now ask the Court to certify its  orders upholding the protective order for  \n                                                             \n1 R. Doc. 1776 in the David Case, R. Doc. 472 in the EEOC Case, and R. Doc. 351 in the Achari Cases. \n2 R. Doc. 1808 in the David  Case and R.  Doc. 384 in  the Achari Cases.  The Bur nett Defendants \nincorporate by reference the arguments set forth in Signal's motion. \n3 The facts of the related cases have been detailed ad nauseum in previous orders.  Familiarity is assumed. \n4 R. Docs. 367 and 476 in the David Case, R. Doc. 285 in the EEOC Case, and R. Doc. 307 in the Achari \nCases. \n5 The Burnett Defendants also argue the protect ive order precludes them from assessing the economic \nharm, if any, suffered by the plaintiffs. \n2 \n \n\ninterlocutory appeal.  In the alternative, Moving Defendants request a discretionary stay \nof the above-captioned matters while they petition the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for  \na writ of mandamus. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n  An interlocutory appeal from a non-final order in a civil case is permissible when \n(1) the order involves \"a controlling question of law,\" (2) there is \"substantial ground for \ndifference of opinion\" on the question pres ented, and (3) an immediate ap peal would \n\"materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\" 6  The district court  \ncannot certify an order for interlocutory appe al unless all three criteria are present.7  In \ndetermining whether certification is appropriate, the Court is mindful that interlocutory \nappeal is \"exceptional \" and \"does not lie  simply to determine t he correct ness of a  \njudgment.\"8   \nLAW AND ANALYSIS \n  The partie s spill much ink arguing wh ether the protective or der involves a \ncontrolling question of law on which there ex ists a substantial ground for difference of \nopinion.  The Court need not decide these issues today.  For the reasons explained more \nfully below, certification is not warranted because an immediate appeal would hinderโ\nrather than hastenโthe ultimate termination of the related cases.   \n  An immediate appeal materially advances the termination of litigation if it would \neliminate t he need for trial, simplify the i ssues for  trial, or reduce the burden of \n                                                             \n6 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(b). \n7 See Aparicio v.  Swan Lake, 643 F.2d 1109, 1110 n.2 (5th Cir.  1981) (\"Section 1292(b) sets out three \ncriteria all of which must be met before the district court may properly certify an interlocutory order for \nappeal.\") (emphasis added). \n8 Clark-Dietz & Assocs.-Eng'rs, Inc. v. Basic Constr. Co., 702 F.2d 67, 68โ69 (5th Cir. 1983). \n3 \n \n\ndiscovery.9  Certification of the protective order would accomplish none  of these  \nobjectives.10  As a non-dispositive order, the revers al or affirmance of a discovery order \nwould seldom (if ever) eliminate the need for trial.   Nor would a decision from the Fifth \nCircuit simplify the issues for trial or redu ce the burden of dis covery.  If anything, \nvacature of the protective order would make discovery even more onerous and unwieldy.   \n  Rather than expediting a final disposition, an interlocutory appeal would actually \ndelay resolution of the related cases.  The  David Case is set for trial in less than three \nmonths.  Even if the Fifth Circuit chose to  hear the interlocutory appeal, the parties \ncould not realistically expect a decision for at least six months.11  Regardless of the Fifth \nCircuit's ruling, the  David Case would the n have to be  returned to the Court's jur y \ndocket, resulting in an addition al lengthy de lay.  Moreover, an extensive delay in the \nDavid Case would likely produce a ripple effect of con tinuances in the  EEOC Case and \nthe Achari Cases.  A nd once the  David Case and the related cases are finally tried, \nappealable issues will almost undoubtedly still exist, 12 which co uld lead to another  \nround of appeals and remands.13   \n                                                             \n9 B&B Advisory Servs., LLC v. Bombardier Aerospace Corp., No. Civ. A. 02-2695, 2003 WL 22326511, at \n*2 (E.D. La. Oct. 9, 2003); see also Panda Energy Int'l, Inc. v. Factory Mut. Ins., Nos. 3:11โCVโ003โK, \n3:10โCVโ2541โK, No. 09โ30453 (SGJ), and No. 09โ30453 (SGJ), 2011 WL 610016, at *5 (N.D. Tex. Feb. \n14, 2011) (\"An appeal materially adva nces the termination of litigation when it accelerates or simplifies \ntrial proceedings.\"). \n10 Courts i n the Fifth C ircuit ha ve recogniz ed  that a dis covery order is s eldom appropriate for \ninterlocutory appeal.  See, e.g., In re Tullius, No. EP-11-mc-365-KC., 2011 WL 5006673, at *2 (W.D. Tex. \nOct. 20, 2011) (\"District courts in the Fifth Circuit are hesitant to grant leave to appeal  interlocutory \norders relating to discovery.\"); Decena v. Am. Int'l Cos. (AIG), No. 11-1574, 2012 WL 1640455, at *2 (E.D. \nLa. May 9, 2o12) (\"As several courts have recognized, pretrial discovery orders will seldom meet the \nrequirements for interlocutory appeal.\"). \n11 As the David Plaintiffs note in their opposition memorandum, the average time for disposition in the \nFifth Circuit is 9.3 months.  See R. Doc. 1811-3 at p. 13. \n12 The related cases present many issues of first impression, which increases the likelihood of appeal. \n13 Such piec emeal appeals are disfavored.   See Mohawk Indus.,  Inc. v. C arpenter, 558 U .S. 100, 106 \n(2009) (\"Permitting piecemeal, prejudgment appeals . . . under mines 'efficient judicial administration' \nand encroaches upon  the prerogatives of distri ct court judges,  who play a 'special role'  in managing \nongoing litigation.) (quoting Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Ris jord, 449 U.S.  368, 374 (1981));  Clark-\nDietz, 702 F.2d at 69 (\"The basic rule of appellate jurisdiction restricts review to final judgments, avoiding \nthe delay and extra effort of piecemeal appeals.\"). \n4 \n \n\n  Having declined to certify the protective order for interlocutory appeal, the Court \nnow considers the alternative r elief requested by Moving Defendantsโa stay pending  \nresolution of an as-of-yet-filed p etition for mandamus relief in the Fifth Circuit.  There \nis no automatic stay of district  proceedings while a petition for writ of mandamus is \npending.14  Accordingl y, any such stay is i mposed under the dis trict court's general \ndiscretionary authority.15 \n  A district court has inherent authority  to manage its docket, which includes the \npower to stay proceedings.16  The moving par ty bears a \"heavy burden\" to demonstrate \nthat a stay is appropriate.17  \"Where a discretionary stay is proposed, something close to \ngenuine necessity should be the mother of its invocation.\"18   \n  For largely the reasons set forth above, Signal has failed to mak e the necessary \nshowing.  The hardship and in convenience that would result fro m a stay substantially \noutweighs any benefit,19 especially in light of the fact that mandamus relief is unlikely to \nbe granted.20  Accordingly, the Court will not issue a stay. \nCONCLUSION \n  Signal seeks to appeal an interlo cutory ruling, the resolution of which will not  \nmaterially advance the related cases to fina l judgment.  Accordingly, the Court will not \ncertify the ruling for interlocutory appeal.  Th e Court also finds that Signal has failed to \ndemonstrate that extraordinary circumstances warrant a discretionary stay.   \n \n                                                             \n14 Woodson v.

Signal (13-6218) \n \n   \nORDER \n  This  matter  was  initially  filed  in  the  Southern  District  of  Mississippi  and \ntransferred to the Eastern District of Louisiana under the \"first-to file\" rule.1  Signal has \nmoved for summary judgment on choice of law.2  The threshold issue is whether the \nchoice-of-law analysis is governed by Mississippi law or instead by the law of Louisiana.  \nAfter resolving this issue, the Court must engage in a substantive conflicts analysis to \ndetermine the law applicable to Plaintiffs' common law claims. \nI.  Whose Law Governs the Choice-of-Law Analysis?  \n  A federal court exercising supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims applies \nthe forum state's choice-of-law rules.3  The Supreme Court has held that when a case is \ntransferred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1404(a),4 the transferee court must apply the choice-\nof-law rules that prevailed in the transferor court.5  Plaintiffs contend the so-called \"Van \nDusen rule\" applies in this case and that therefore Mississippi's choice-of-law principles \ncontrol.  Plaintiffs offer two arguments in support. \n                                                             \n1 See generally Achari v. Signal Int'l, LLC, Nos. 1:13CV222โLGโJMR, 1:13CV318โLGโJMR, 1:13CV319โ\nLGโJMR, 2013 WL 5705660 (S.D. Miss. Oct. 18, 2013). \n2 R. Doc. 333. \n3 See Janvey v. Brown, 767 F.3d 430, 434 n.10 (5th Cir. 2014) \n4 This statue permits change of venue \"[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses,\" and \"in the interest \nof justice.\"  28 U.S.C. ยง 1404(a). \n5 See generally Ferens v. John Deere Co., 494 U.S. 516 (1990). \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 534   Filed 06/04/15   Page 3 of 5\n  First, they argue a transfer order under the first-to-file rule is effectuated through \nSection 1404(a) as a matter of law.6  The Court disagrees.  Plaintiff has not identified any \nFifth Circuit precedent to support this novel argument,7 nor has the Court found any.  \nThe first-to-file rule is a distinct procedural mechanism for transferring venue.8  For this \nreason, district courts in the Fifth Circuit routinely distinguish between transfers under \nSection 1404(a) and transfers under the first-to-file rule.9   \n  Second, even if this case was transferred under the first-to-file rule, Plaintiffs \nargue the \"logic and holdings of both Van Dusen and Ferens\" should still apply.10  The \nFifth Circuit has not yet addressed this issue.11  As far as this Court can tell, only four \ncourts have addressed whether the Van Dusen rule applies to first-to-file transfers.  One \ncourt has squarely held it does not.12  The other threeโwhile not directly answering the \nquestionโexpressed skepticism that Van Dusen applies to transfers under the first-to-\nfile rule.13  The Court finds the reasoning in these cases persuasive.  Furthermore, \n                                                             \n6 See R. Doc. 347, p. 12. \n7 Plaintiffs cite one district court decision from Delaware in support. \n8 See White v. Peco Foods, Inc., 546 F. Supp. 2d 339, 343 (S.D. Miss. 2008) (\"As other district courts have \npointed out, a motion to transfer pursuant to the first-to-file rule does not depend on the presence or \nabsence of the ยง 1404(a) considerations.\"). \n9 See, e.g., Partners, L.P. v. Land Am. Am. Title Co., No. 3-08-CV-1547-O, 2008 WL 5119599, at *4 (N.D. \nTex.

Co, Inc., 386 F.3d 581, 600 (4th Cir. 2004) \n(\"Under these circumstances, and in light of the principles animating the Supreme Court's decision in Van \nDusen, we are not at all sure that the Van Dusen precedent should be blindly and mechanically applied, as \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 534   Filed 06/04/15   Page 4 of 5\nbecause the policy justifications underlying Section 1404(a) and the first-to-file rule are \noften in tension,14 it makes little sense to apply the Van Dusen ruleโa rule developed to \ngovern Section 1404(a) transfersโto a first-t0-file transfer.  Because the Court finds the \nVan  Dusen  rule  inapplicable  in  this  case,  Louisiana  law  governs  the  choice-of-law \nanalysis. \nII.  Choice-of-Law Analysis \n  The Court has already engaged in a similar Louisiana conflicts analysis in the \nDavid case.15  Because the operative facts and causes of action in David are substantially \nsimilar to the instant case,16 the David opinion guides the Court's analysis.  In David, \nthe  Court  held  that  the  law  of  India  governs  the  claims  for  fraud  and  negligent \nmisrepresentation and that Mississippi law governs the claims for breach of contract \nand agency.  There is no reason to deviate from this analysis. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nthe [plaintiffs] would have us do.\"); Chartis, 930 F.
