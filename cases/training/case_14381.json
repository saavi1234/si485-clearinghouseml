Plaintiffs filed this suit after District Judge Jay Zainey <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-LA-0010-0016.pdf\">denied class certification</a> on Jan. 3, 2012 in a related case, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14377\">I<i>David v. Signal International</i></a>.  </p><p>Plaintiffs were brought to the United States to provide labor and services to defendant Signal International, a company in the business of providing repairs to offshore oil rigs that was based in Pascagoula, Mississippi and had operations in the Gulf Coast region. The complaint alleged that plaintiffs paid Signal's recruiters as much as $25,000 for travel, visa, and recruitment fees, but upon arrival in the United States found out they would not receive the green cards promised to them. Instead, plaintiffs were allegedly forced to pay additional fees ($1050 per month) to live in racially segregated labor camps, and were subject to squalid living conditions and threats of both legal and physical harm if they complained about the conditions or decided not to provide labor. </p><p>The complaint alleged violations of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (18 U.S.C. ยง1589 (forced labor) and 18 U.S.C. ยง1590 (trafficking)) and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. ยง1981), as well as claims for fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract. Plaintiffs were represented by private law firms. </p><p>In Oct. 2013, the Court (Chief U.S. District Judge Louis Guirola, Jr.) consolidated this case and <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14380\"><i>Achari v. Signal International</i></a>, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14383\"><i>Krishnakutty v.

DEFENDANTS\nORDER CONSOLIDATING CASES\nAND TRANSFERRING TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT \nCOURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA\nBEFORE THE COURT are the Motion [33] to Consolidate filed by Signal\nInternational, Inc. and Signal International, LLC (โSignalโ) in cause no. 1:13cv222-\nLG-JMR, and the Motions to Transfer filed by Signal in each of the above-captioned\ncases (the โMississippi casesโ).  The motions are opposed by the plaintiffs.  After due\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 32   Filed 10/18/13   Page 2 of 10\nconsideration, the Court concludes that consolidation for the purpose of considering\ntransfer is appropriate, and that the Mississippi cases should be transferred to the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, where a\nsubstantially similar case was first filed and is pending.  Accordingly, the motions\nto consolidate and transfer will be granted.  The Court declines to rule on any\nremaining motions, leaving them for determination by the transferee court.  \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\nSignal seeks consolidation, stay and transfer of four cases to the Eastern\nDistrict of Louisiana.  The four are this case (โAchariโ), Chakkiyattl v. Signal, No.\n13cv318-LG-JMR (โChakkiyattlโ), Krishnakutty v. Signal, No. 13cv319-LG-JMR\n(โKrishnakuttyโ), and Devassy v. Signal, 1:13cv327-HSO-RHW (โDevassyโ).1  Signal\nargues that these cases are closely related to a similar lawsuit filed in the Eastern\nDistrict of Louisiana in March 2008, David, et al. v. Signal, et al., No. 2:08-CV-\n1220-JCZ-DEK (\"David\").  Signal submits that under the \"first filed\" rule, the four\ncases should be transferred so that their issues can be resolved with David.\nThe Eastern District of Louisiana district judge summarized the David\nplaintiffsโ claims as alleging a scheme to lure foreign workers to work for Signal in\nMississippi and Texas with the promise of permanent residence in the United\nStates.  Once in the United States, the David plaintiffs alleged they were subjected\nto discrimination and adverse working and living conditions.  The plaintiffs allege\n1  Devassy was recently consolidated with Achari. \n-2-\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 32   Filed 10/18/13   Page 3 of 10\nthat the recruitment defendants obtained millions of dollars in fees and Signal\nobtained workers for a lesser cost than if it hired American workers.  David, Order\n& Reasons at 4, Jan. 4, 2012 (denying motion to certify class).\nSignal is one of twelve defendants in David.2  The plaintiffs in David are a\nnumber of Indian nationals who were Signal employees.  Their Third Amended\nComplaint asserts violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\nOrganizations Act (RICO), the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act\n(TVPA), 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1985, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA),\nand claims of fraud/negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract.  Several\nplaintiffs also bring individual claims of retaliation under ยง 1981 and ยง 1985, and\nclaims of false imprisonment, assault, battery, and infliction of emotional distress.  \nThe plaintiffs in these Mississippi cases were previously among the plaintiffs\nin the David case who sought to be certified as a class.  After class certification was\ndenied by the Louisiana district court judge, they filed complaints in this Court. \n2  The David Defendants are: Signal International L.L.C; Malvern C.\nBurnett; Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, L.L.C.; Law Offices of Malvern C.\nBurnett, A.P.C.; Indo-Ameri Soft L.L.C.; Kurella Rao; J & M Associates, Inc. of\nMississippi; Billy R. Wilks; J & M Marine & Industrial, L.L.C.; Global Resources,\nInc.; Michael Pol; Sachin Dewan; and Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd. (a/k/a MedTech\nConsultants).  Signal has also filed claims against a third-party defendant, Zito\nCompanies, LLC.\n-3-\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 32   Filed 10/18/13   Page 4 of 10\nThe plaintiffs in Achari are a number of Indian nationals who allege that\nSignal, through recruiters, lured them to the United States to work in deplorable,\ndiscriminatory  conditions with the promise of permanent U.S. residency.  (Am.\nCompl. 3-7, ECF No. 26).  They assert claims of violation of the TVPA, 42 U.S.C. ยง\n1981, fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of\ncontract. \nThe plaintiffs in Chakkiyattil are a number of Indian nationals who allege\nthat Signal, through recruiters, lured them to the United States to work in\ndeplorable, discriminatory conditions with the promise of permanent U.S.\nresidency.  Chakkiyattil, No. 1:13cv318-LG-JMR, Compl. passim, ECF No. 1.  They\nassert claims of violation of the TVPA, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981, fraudulent\nmisrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract.  Id. 111-\n121.\nThe plaintiffs in Krishnakutty are a number of Indian nationals who allege\nthat Signal, through recruiters, lured them to the United States to work in\ndeplorable, discriminatory conditions with the promise of permanent U.S.\nresidency.  Krishnakutty, No. 1:13cv319-LG-JMR, Compl. 2, ECF No. 1.  They bring\nclaims against all defendants for violation of the TVPA, RICO, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981 &\n1985, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, โmoney had and\nreceived,โ breach of special/confidential relationship, and against certain\ndefendants, breach of fiduciary duty. \n-4-\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 32   Filed 10/18/13   Page 5 of 10\nThe plaintiffs in Devassy are a number of Indian nationals who allege that\nSignal, through recruiters, lured them to the United States to work in deplorable,\ndiscriminatory conditions with the promise of permanent U.S. residency.  Devassy,\nNo. 1:13cv327-HSO-RHW, Compl. 1-2, ECF No. 1.  They assert claims of violation of\nthe TVPA, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981, fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent\nmisrepresentation, and breach of contract.\nDISCUSSION\nI.  Motion to Consolidate\nSignal contends that the above cases should be consolidated only for the\npurpose of deciding whether the first-filed rule requires the Court to transfer the\ncases to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. \nSignal argues that the first-filed rule applies equally to all the cases it wishes to\nconsolidate for the purpose of transfer. \nThe plaintiffs argue that consolidation will not aid the Court as a matter of\nconvenience and judicial economy.  Plaintiffs contend that even though all four\ncases stem from David, they bring different claims against different defendants,\nand so individual attention must be given to each case in making the transfer\ndecision.  \nThe Court has broad discretion in determining whether and to what extent to\nconsolidate cases.  Ctr. for Biological Diversity, Inc. v. BP Am. Prod. Co., 704 F.3d\n413, 432 (5th Cir. 2013) (โThe trial courtโs managerial power is especially strong\nand flexible in matters of consolidation.โ); Mills v. Beech Aircraft Corp., Inc., 886\n-5-\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 32   Filed 10/18/13   Page 6 of 10\nF.2d 758, 762 (5th Cir. 1989).  The question of whether these cases should be\ntransferred to the Eastern District of Louisiana pursuant to the first-filed rule will\nrequire analysis of a single body of law in relation to each case.  The summary\nabove of each case shows that there is substantial similarity in the underlying facts\nand theories of recovery.  The Court finds that considering the cases together will\nresult in judicial economy.  Accordingly, the Motion to Consolidate will be granted.\nII.  Motion to Stay and Transfer Pursuant to the First-to-File Rule\nThe \"first to file\" rule permits a district court to decline jurisdiction over an\naction when it involves the same parties and issues as a previously-filed action in\nanother court.  When related cases are pending before two federal courts, the court\nin which the case was last filed may dismiss or transfer the case if it involves\nsubstantially similar issues which can be resolved in the earlier-filed action. See W.\nGulf Mar. Ass'n v. ILA Deep Sea Local 24, 751 F.2d 721, 728-29 (5th Cir. 1985) and\nSave Power Ltd. v. Syntek Fin. Corp., 121 F.3d 947, 950 (5th Cir. 1997).  โThe\nconcern manifestly is to avoid the waste of duplication, to avoid rulings which may\ntrench upon the authority of sister courts, and to avoid piecemeal resolution of\nissues that call for a uniform result.โ  W. Gulf Mar. Ass'n, 751 F.2d at 728. \nThe Court's inquiry is focused on whether the cases \"substantially overlap,\"\nbut where the overlap is \"less than complete, the judgment is made case by case,\nbased on such factors as the extent of overlap, the likelihood of conflict, the\ncomparative advantage and the interest of each forum in resolving the dispute.โ\nSave Power Ltd., 121 F.3d at 951.  The first-to-file rule is a discretionary doctrine. \n-6-\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 32   Filed 10/18/13   Page 7 of 10\nCadle Co. v. Whataburger of Alice, Inc., 174 F.3d 599, 603 (5th Cir. 1999) (citing\nKerotest Mfg. Co. v. C-O-Two Fire Equip. Co., 342 U.S. 180, 183-84 (1952)).  It is not\na rigid or inflexible rule to be mechanically applied.  Mann Mfg., Inc. v. Hortex, Inc.,\n439 F.2d 403, 407 (5th Cir. 1971).  The decision of whether to apply the first-to-file\nrule involves determinations concerning \"[w]ise judicial administration, giving\nregard to conservation of judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of\nlitigation.\"  Kerotest, 342 U.S. at 183.  \nIn support of its motion, Signal argues that the first to file rule applies\nbecause the issues and parties in the David case completely encompass the issues\nand parties in the Mississippi cases.  Signal provides a press release by the\nSouthern Poverty Law Center as evidence that the lawyers for the plaintiffs\nacknowledged the substantial overlap of David and the Mississippi cases.  (Def.\nMemo. Ex. 1, ECF No. 12-1).  In response, the plaintiffs argue that 1) there is a\nserious question of whether the Louisiana court can exercise personal jurisdiction\nover all of the named defendants; 2) there is no overlap of parties because the\nplaintiffs in the Mississippi cases are not parties to the David case; and 3) denial of\nclass certification in David shows that there is no substantial overlap of issues.  \nIn regard to the question of substantial overlap of parties and issues, the\nCourt finds that both exist here.  The fact that the plaintiffs are no longer parties to\nthe David case does not negate the presence of many defendants in common.3  The \n3  Defendants common to David and Achari are Signal International L.L.C;\n-7-\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 32   Filed 10/18/13   Page 8 of 10\nMississippi defendants are merely subsets of the David defendants.  \nMalvern C.

All of the Devassy defendants are named in David.\n-8-\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 32   Filed 10/18/13   Page 9 of 10\nFurther, the issues are almost identical.  In all cases, the plaintiffs allege a\nhuman trafficking scheme that induced them to emigrate from India with the\nunfulfilled promise of permanent United States residency, and the imposition of\nadverse working and living conditions.  The theories of recovery in all of the\nMississippi cases are also presented in the David case.  Finally, it should be noted\nthat failing to meet the commonality requirements for class certification is not\nequivalent to a lack of substantial overlap of issues.  There is such substantial\noverlap that the Mississippi cases should be transferred to the Eastern District of\nLouisiana for consideration of the issues.\nThe plaintiffs question the ability of the Louisiana court to assert personal\njurisdiction over all of the defendants.  If there is such a question in these cases, it\nmust also be addressed in David, as all of the defendants named in the Mississippi\ncases are also named in David.  It would be improper for this Court to analyze the\nLouisiana courtโs jurisdiction in any event.  The Fifth Circuit has rejected the\nproposition that the first-to-file rule requires the second-filed court to consider the\njurisdiction of the first.  Cadle Co. v. Whataburger of Alice, Inc., 174 F.3d 599, 604-\n05 (5th Cir. 1999).  โOnce the likelihood of a substantial overlap between the two\nsuits has been demonstrated, it is no longer up to the second filed court to resolve\nthe question of whether both should be allowed to proceed.โ  Id. at 606 (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted).  โ[T]he first-to-file rule โnot only determines\nwhich court may decide the merits of substantially similar issues, but also\nestablishes which court may decide whether the second suit filed must be dismissed,\n-9-\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 32   Filed 10/18/13   Page 10 of 10\nstayed or transferred and consolidated.โโ Street v.

Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.c. ยง 1391 (b )(2) because \nDefendants conducted a substantial part of their trafficking, civil rights violations, fraud, \nmisrepresentations and contractual breaches within the Southern District of Mississippi. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nThe Initial Recruitment Process \n57.  From 2003 through at least 2005, Dewan and Global Resources, in \ncoordination with Burnett and J & M Associates, placed advertisements in newspapers in India, \nthe United Arab Emirates and Kuwait seeking welders, fitters and other marine fabrication \nworkers for J & M Associates. \n58.  The advertisements announced job opportunities in the United States and \npromised that qualified candidates could obtain legal permanent residence (green cards) in the \nUnited States for themselves and their families.  One such advertisement listed Dewan \nConsultants as the contact and promised a \"Job opportunity\" and \"Permanent lifetime settlement \nin USA for self and family.\"  Plaintiffs either saw these advertisements themselves or were told \nofthe advertised opportunities by family or friends. \n59.  In response to these advertisements, Plaintiffs contacted Dewan and \nGlobal Resources and attended meetings and testing sessions organized by Dewan, Global \nResources, Burnett and J & M Associates at several locations throughout India and the United \nArab Emirates. \nII \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 12 of 123\n60.  At these meetings and in telephone conversations, Dewan, Global \nResources and Burnett told Plaintiffs that J & M Associates was a U.S. company offering \nemployment opportunities in the United States. \n61.  Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett told Plaintiffs that if they passed \ntrade tests in India or the United Arab Emirates, and paid fees totaling 465,000 to 900,000 rupees \n(approximately $9,800 to $15,000), then J & M Associates would sponsor them in applications \nfor green cards, enabling them to permanently and legally immigrate to the United States. \n62.  Dewan, Global Resources, Burnett and J & M Associates told Plaintiffs \nthat for approximately $1,500 more per family member, Plaintiffs could also obtain green cards \nfor their spouses and children. \n63.  Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett told Plaintiffs that the total fees \nwould be paid in three installments. \n64.  Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett assured Plaintiffs that they would \nreceive green cards within two years of arriving in the United States.  They also promised to do \neverything necessary to obtain green cards for Plaintiffs within those two years. \n65.  Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett did not intend to diligently pursue \ngreen card applications on Plaintiffs' behalf and each knew, or should have known, that they \nwould not do so. \n66.  Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett knowingly and falsely represented, \nor should have known, inter alia, that the green card applications would be valid and bona fide \nunder U.S. immigration law and that the applications were likely to be completed and approved \nwithin the promised time. \n12 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 13 of 123\n67.  Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett represented to Plaintiffs that no \nadditional fees would be required for the legal services necessary to obtain the green cards. \n68.  Based on these and other contractually binding promises made to them \nconcerning opportunities for employment and green cards in the United States, Plaintiffs signed \ncontracts with Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett. \n69.  In reasonable reliance on explicit and repeated promises by Dewan, \nGlobal Resources and Burnett regarding lawful and legitimate employment opportunities and \npermanent immigration opportunities for Plaintiffs and their families in the United States, \nPlaintiffs undertook considerable economic, social, familial and personal sacrifices, including \npayment of high fees, assumption of significant interest-bearing debt, loss of real and personal \nproperty and lost work opportunities. \n70.  Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett knew Plaintiffs would rely, and \nintended to cause Plaintiffs to rely, on these misrepresentations as well as other \nmisrepresentations andlor omissions described herein. \n71.  Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett, in breach of the applicable contract \nprovisions, failed to provide these opportunities for employment andlor green cards in the United \nStates. \n72.  Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett knew, or should have known, that \nbreaching these contractual provisions, as well as other contractually binding promises, would \ncause Plaintiffs to suffer severe emotional distress. \n73.  The contracts signed by Plaintiffs and other documents provided to \nPlaintiffs by Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett promised that Plaintiffs would receive a \n13 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 14 of 123\nrefund of all or substantially all of their payments if Plaintiffs did not receive green cards as \npromised. \n74.  Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett knew or should have known that \nthey would not refund Plaintiffs' payments as promised and, in breach of the applicable contract \nprovisions, refused to refund Plaintiffs' payments upon request. \n75.  After Plaintiffs signed contracts with Dewan, Global Resources and \nBurnett, each Plaintiff made the first, and in some cases the second, installment payments \nrequired by these contracts.  Plaintiffs were required to divide each installment into three equal \nparts and make separate payments to Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett. \n76.  After Plaintiffs made the first installment payments, these Defendants \ngenerally failed to provide Plaintiffs with updates regarding the status of their green card \napplications for more than a year.  When some Plaintiffs contacted these Defendants at various \ntimes between mid-2004 and mid-2006 to check on the progress of their green card applications, \nthe Defendants described purported reasons for the delays but assured Plaintiffs that the green \ncard process was going forward. \n77.  During this time, Plaintiffs continued to accrue substantial interest on the \nmoney they had borrowed to make the first installment payments. \n78.  At various times in 2005 and early 2006, Dewan, Global Resources and \nBurnett notified Plaintiffs that the labor certifications required for their green card applications \nhad been approved by the U.S. government.  After this notification, Dewan, Global Resources \nand Burnett collected the second installment payments from Plaintiffs. \n14 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 15 of 123\nThe Recruitment Process For Signal \n79.  After Hurricane Katrina struck in August 2005, Signal required laborers to \nreplace Signal employees who had been displaced by the storm and to fulfill the demand for \nrepairs and fabrication caused by damage from the storm. \n80.  In or around Mayor June 2006, Signal authorized Dewan, Global \nResources and Burnett to act as its agents in India and the United Arab Emirates for the purpose \nof recruiting Indian welders and fitters. \n81.  Signal further authorized its agents to represent that Signal would assume, \nfrom J & M Associates, sponsorship of the pending green card applications on behalf of \nPlaintiffs and others, and that Signal would apply for at least two H-2B visa extensions on behalf \nof all the Indian H-2B workers, including Plaintiffs, to allow them to remain in the United States \nworking for Signal while their green card applications were being processed. \n82.  Signal authorized its agents to make these representations even though it \nknew and had reason to know that such visa extensions and green card applications would not \nhave been valid and bona fide under U.S. immigration law, and even though it did not intend to \napply for such visa extensions or green cards on behalf of all the Indian H-2B workers, including \nPlaintiffs. \n83.  In 2006, Plaintiffs spoke with Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett over \nthe phone or in person regarding their long-pending green card applications. \n84.  In these communications, Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett offered \nPlaintiffs the opportunity to pursue their green cards under the sponsorship of Signal, rather than \nJ & M Associates as previously agreed.  Plaintiffs were told that they could quickly obtain H-2B \nvisas to go to the United States for work at Signal's operations. \n15 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 16 of 123\n85.  Many Plaintiffs were required to pay an additional sum of approximately \n30,000 to 150,000 rupees ($500 to $3,000) for this opportunity. \n86.  Plaintiffs were told that if they did not want to work for Signal, they could \neither abandon the recruitment process, forfeiting all or most of the payments they had already \nmade, or continue to wait for the opportunity with J & M Associates. \n87.  Acting as Signal's agents, Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett falsely \nassured Plaintiffs that they would continue pursuing Plaintiffs' green cards while Plaintiffs \nworked for Signal, that Signal would seek at least two extensions of Plaintiffs' temporary H-2B \nvisas and that the H-2B visas would thereafter be converted to green cards. \n88.  Acting as Signal's agents, Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett failed to \ndisclose material facts regarding the H-2B visa, including the fact that H-2B visas confer only a \ntemporary non-immigrant status and the fact that applying for H-2B visa status is fundamentally \nincompatible with simultaneously applying for a green card. \n89.  In reliance on the representations of Dewan, Global Resources and \nBurnett, Plaintiffs, who were unaware of U.S. immigration law and the temporary nature of \nH-2B visas and who did not wish to forfeit the substantial fees they had already paid, agreed to \ntransfer their green card applications to Signal's sponsorship and further agreed to work for \nSignal under H-2B visas. \n90.  In May and June 2006, Burnett, on behalf of Signal, prepared and \nsubmitted to the Mississippi Department of Employment and the United States Department of \nLabor completed forms ETA 750 and attachments (the \"ETA 750 forms\") seeking to hire \nPlaintiffs under the auspices of8 U.S.C. ยง I I OI(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b), attendant regulations 8 C.F.R. \n16 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 17 of 123\nยง 214.2(h)(6) and 20 C.F.R. ยง 655.3, and associated administrative letters and or guidance \n(commonly known and referred to herein as the \"H-2B guestworker program\"). \n91.  The H-2B guestworker program permits U.S. employers that have first \nobtained temporary labor certifications to bring foreign workers to the United States on \ntemporary visas to meet labor needs when employers attest that they cannot find qualified U.S. \nworkers to perform the available jobs. \n92.  H-2B visas are non-immigrant visas.  They are only valid for work with \nthe specific employer listed on the visa, and they do not provide portable or transferable \nemployment authorization for the foreign worker. \n93.  The ETA 750 forms state that \"[t]o knowingly furnish any false \ninformation in the preparation of this form and any supplement thereto or to aid, abet, or counsel \nanother to do so is a felony punishable by a $10,000 fine or 5 years in the penitentiary, or both.\" \n94.  Signal personnel swore, under pain of perjury, to the veracity of the \ninformation contained in the ETA 750 forms. \n95.  Burnett and Signal stated in the ETA 750 forms that Signal sought \nworkers to perform jobs including welding and fitting. \n96.  Burnett and Signal stated in the ETA 750 forms that Signal would employ \nworkers from October 1,2006 to July 31, 2007, even though they knew that Signal's labor need \nwas projected to be at least two to three years. \n97.  Signal stated in the ETA 750 forms that its need for H-2B guestworkers \nwas caused by \"peak load\" and a \"one-time occurrence demand for labor in excess of that which \n[its] employees can effectively provide,\" and that \"the temporary workers will not become a part \nof the permanent workforce,\" but instead \"wi \\I work for the length of the prescribed dates of \n17 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 18 of 123\nneed, will be paid in accordance with the prevailing wage, and will return to their home country \nat the end of employment.\" \n98.  In summer of 2006, the U.S. Department of Labor approved Signal's labor \ncertification applications for 590 workers for the period of October I, 2006 through July 31, \n2007. \n99.  In July and August of2006, Burnett, on behalf of Signal, filed with the \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (\"USCIS\") completed 1-129 forms and attachments \nseeking 590 H-2B visas for Indian workers, including Plaintiffs.  In these H-2B visa applications, \nSignal and Burnett misrepresented the duration of Signal's labor need. \n100.  Signal attested that its labor need ran for ten months from October I, 2006 \nthrough July 31, 2007, even though Signal expected its labor need to last at least two to three \nyears.  Signal falsely represented to the government that it intended to return all H-2B visa \nrecipients to India after ten months. \n101.  Burnett declared that the H-2B applications were based on information of \nwhich he had knowledge, even though he knew that Signal intended to employ Plaintiffs for \nmore than ten months. \n102.  Signal's and Burnett's representations to the government on the H-2B visa \napplications were knowingly false, and the very fact that they were applying for temporary work \nvisas was inconsistent with their representations to Plaintiffs that they would pursue green cards \nand permanent residency for them. \nThe Conclusion Of The Recruitment Process \n103.  During 2006, Signal personnel, along with Dewan, traveled to India and \nthe United Arab Emirates to test Plaintiffs' welding and pipefitting skills. \n104.  Plaintiffs paid travel costs and admission fees to take these tests. \n18 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 19 of 123\n105.  Before securing H-2B visas. Plaintiffs were interviewed by U.S. consulate \nofficials in Indian cities including Chennai and Mumbai. \n106.  Plaintiffs paid to travel from their homes or current places of employment \nto these interviews. \n107.  Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett, acting as Signal's agents, required \nPlaintiffs to meet with them and, in some instances, Signal personnel, before the consulate \ninterviews. \n108.  At these pre-interview meetings, Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett \nensured that Plaintiffs were current on the fee installments required by their contracts. \n109.  Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett required Plaintiffs to sign \ndocuments permitting Sachin Dewan to receive their visa-stamped passports from the U.S. \nconsulate on behalf of Plaintiffs. \n110.  Dewan, Global Resources, Burnett and Signal personnel coached Plaintiffs \non what to say during consulate interviews. \nIll.  Dewan, Global Resources, Burnett and Signal personnel told Plaintiffs \nthat if they did not follow these instructions regarding the interviews, none of Plaintiffs would \nreceive visas and they would lose the opportunity to permanently immigrate to the United States \nand forfeit all previous payments. \n112.  During Plaintiffs' consulate interviews, the consulate officials took \nPlaintiffs' passports from them for visa processing. \n113.  By fall 2006, the USCIS approved Signal's H-2B visa petitions for 590 \nH-2B workers for the period of October 1,2006 through July 31,2007. \n19 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 20 of 123\n114.  Once Plaintiffs' visas were approved, consulate officials sent Plaintiffs' \npassports, with H-2B visas affixed, directly to Sachin Dewan. \n115.  After Plaintiffs' visas were approved, Dewan and Global Resources \narranged Plaintiffs' travel to the United States. \n116.  Plaintiffs paid Dewan and Global Resources for making these \narrangements. \n117.  Before Plaintiffs could leave for the United States, they were required to \nattend final meetings in Dewan's Mumbai office. \n118.  These meetings typically took place just hours before Plaintiffs' scheduled \ndepartures to the United States. \n119.  During these meetings, Dewan's office was crowded with Indian workers \nawaiting departure to the United States. \n120.  At these meetings, Dewan collected the final installment payments \nrequired by Plaintiffs' contracts.  Dewan also demanded that Plaintiffs return any receipts, \nagreements or other documentation they had received from him during the recruitment process. \n121.  Dewan also required Plaintiffs, most of whom do not proficiently read or \nspeak English, to sign documents written in English, with little or no time to review them. \nSachin Dewan and his staff demanded that Plaintiffs sign these documents quickly. \n122.  Because of these demands and because their flights to the United States \nwere about to depart, Plaintiffs signed the documents. \n123.  Plaintiffs had no reasonable opportunity to review, negotiate or make any \nchanges to the English documents presented to them. \n20 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 21 of 123\n124.  Dewan did not return Plaintiffs' passports until after Plaintiffs had paid the \nfinal installments and signed the mandatory paperwork. \n125.  Dewan had intimidating employees or associates present in his office \nduring these final collections and at least one Plaintiff heard Sachin Dewan yelling at other \nrecruited workers. \n126.  Based on Dewan's threatening and coercive behavior during these pre \ndeparture meetings in Mumbai, Dewan's possession of Plaintiffs' passports and the extraordinary \nand increasing levels of debt they had incurred to pay Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett for \ngreen card and H-2B visa arrangements, Plaintiffs reasonably believed that they had no choice \nbut to make the final required payments and to travel to the United States to work for Signal. \n127.  Plaintiffs would not have paid the exorbitant fees charged by Dewan, \nGlobal Resources and Burnett for travel, green cards, visas and employment opportunities had \nthey known that Defendants' prom ises and representations were false, and that Defendants had \nfailed to disclose material facts concerning the nature and terms and conditions of the \nimmigration and work opportunities offered. \nLiving And Working Conditions At The Signal Facilities In Pascagoula, Mississippi \n128.  Plaintiffs and more than five hundred other Indian H-2B workers traveled \nfrom Mumbai to Signal's operations in the United States at various times from late October 2006 \nto April 2007 on tickets arranged by Dewan and Global Resources. \n129.  Approximately 300 ofthese workers, including Plaintiffs, were sent to \nSignal's facility in Pascagoula, Mississippi. \n130.  Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett knew, or should have known, of the \npoor conditions in the camp and misrepresented and/or omitted to disclose these conditions to \nPlaintiffs. \n21 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 22 of 123\n131.  Had Plaintiffs known of the conditions in the camp, each would not have \ncontracted with Dewan, Global Resources and Burnett. \nUnsuitable Housing \n132,  Signal constructed a labor camp in fall 2006 to house Indian workers. \nSignal employees and management referred to the Pascagoula camp as \"the Reservation.\" \nPlaintiffs were required to live in the camp. \n133.  The Pascagoula camp was isolated, overcrowded, unsanitary and not \nsuitable for human habitation. \n134.  Signal crowded sixteen to twenty-four men into each of the camp's \nhousing units.  The bunk beds were so tightly packed that Plaintiffs could barely walk between \nthem.  The top bunks were so close to the ceiling, and the bottom bunks so close to the top \nbunks, that Plaintiffs could barely sit up in their beds. \n135.  The housing units had insufficient toilet and showering facilities.  Lines \nfor the bathroom were consistently very long and Plaintiffs had to wait in line for hours to use \nthe toilet.  With three or fewer showers per housing unit, hot water ran out quickly and Plaintiffs \nwere often only able to take cold showers after their long waits in line. \n136.  The housing units had little or no space to store personal belongings. \nPlaintiffs instead often kept their clothing -- even if wet and soiled from work -- in bed with them \nbecause there was no other place to put it. \n137.  The housing units provided no privacy.  Sleep was difficult due to the \nnoise from such close quarters, oppressive smells and the comings and goings of workers who \nworked on different shifts.  Workers, including some Plaintiffs, saw rats and mice in their \nsleeping areas and a wasps' nest in one housing unit. \n22 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 23 of 123\n138.  The camp failed to meet the standards set by the federal government's \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\").  For example, the OSHA guidelines \nstate that bunkhouses of similar purpose should have at least fifty square feet of floor space per \nperson. Signal's housing units offered less than eighteen square feet of floor space per person. \nThe guidelines also require bunk beds to be at least forty-eight inches apart from other beds. \nSignal's bunk beds were so tightly packed together that workers were essentially sleeping next to \neach other. \n139.  Workers, including some Plaintiffs, told Signal personnel on numerous \noccasions that they found these conditions to be intolerable. \n140.  Internal communications among Signal personnel discussed the \n\"overcrowding,\" acknowledging that the Pascagoula camp needed at least three more housing \nunits, as well as more toilets and sinks. \nPoor Quality Food \n141.  The food provided by Signal was unhealthy, unpleasant and often rotten. \nMeals were offered exclusively in a cafeteria, which was only open during limited hours and \nwhich would sometimes run out of food.  Workers who were able to get food before it ran out \nwere often served food that had spoiled.  Some Plaintiffs observed unsanitary conditions in the \nkitchen and during food preparation.  Meat was left uncovered and unrefrigerated, and because \nthe kitchen was infested with vermin, insects got into the food as it was being prepared. \n142.  Workers frequently complained to Signal personnel that the food was so \nbad that they were left hungry.  Others complained to Signal that the food was making them \nphysically ill. \n143.  Signal personnel told workers, including Plaintiff Padinhare, that they \nshould not complain because the food was better in the camp than the food in India. \n23 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 24 of 123\n144.  In an email to other Signal personnel, Signal Senior Vice President and \nGeneral Manager Ron Schnoor acknowledged the \"bad, stale, molded, and otherwise poor \nquality food.\" \nIllness \n145.  Workers frequently became severely ill.  For example, Plaintiff Shaikh \nbecame violently ill on three occasions.  His doctor advised him that his repeated illnesses were \ndue to unsanitary food and living conditions. \n146.  Plaintiff Meledan developed chronic chest pain after arriving at the camp. \nHis doctor advised him that this chest pain was due to the camp's unhealthy food. \n147.  Signal personnel were aware of Plaintiffs' health problems.  One Signal \nemployee wrote in a journal that: \n[0 Jur Indians have been dropping with sickness like flies .... [They J are getting \nworried and believe there are unhealthful conditions in the camp.  It is true.  The \nreason is because the plumbing was so shoddily done by GE's subcontractors, and \nwater has leaked everywhere and stagnated as a result, which serves as a bacterial \nbreeding ground. \nConstant And Invasive Monitoring \n148.  The camp was located in an isolated industrial area far from other \nresidential communities, shopping facilities, houses of worship and other basic amenities. \n149.  The camp was enclosed by fences and barbed wire and was accessible \nonly by a few entrances, which were watched by security guards at all times. \n150.  When leaving or entering the camp, Plaintiffs were required to show \nidentification, tell the guards where they were going to or coming from, and subject themselves \nand their belongings to search.  Plaintiffs' movements into and out of the camp were recorded. \n151.  Posters around the camp featured pictures of cameras and the words \"I'm \nwatching you.\" \n24 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 25 of 123\n152.  Guests normally were not permitted in the camp, and Plaintiffs were \npermitted visitors only in the parking lot.  Plaintiffs were specifically prohibited from receiving \nvisitors from not-for-profit organizations that might advise Plaintiffs of their rights under state \nand federal law or provide other supportive services. \n153.  Because the camp was isolated, Plaintiffs generally had to rely on Signal \nprovided transportation to take them to populated areas, which Signal only offered after workers \nhad been at the camp for some time.  But Signal would generally only provide transportation to \nWal-Mart or the bank.  Even then, Plaintiffs had little privacy because Signal security would \nsometimes follow them into Wal-Mart. \n154.  Signal's private security forces entered Plaintiffs' housing units at night. \nSignal personnel and camp security guards conducted searches of the housing units, including \nsearches of workers' personal belongings. \n155.  Plaintiffs were not told when these searches would be conducted and were \nnot told what Signal was looking for. \n156.  Signal prohibited Plaintiffs from bringing food into the housing units. \n157.  Signal prohibited Plaintiffs from drinking alcohol at the camp.  Violation \nof this prohibition or other rules subjected the workers to fines of $250 and suspension from \nwork.  Repeat \"offenses\" were punishable by a $500 fine. \n158.  Signal did not bar its non-Indian workers from having visitors or drinking \nalcohol in their homes.  Nor did Signal confine its non-Indian workers to crowded housing units \nor subject them to surveillance and searches oftheir homes and belongings. \n25 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 26 of 123\nExcessive Charges For Housing And Food \n159.  Signal charged Plaintiffs and other Indian workers $35 dollars per day \n(approximately $1,050 per month) for room and board.  The mandatory $35 daily fee was \ndeducted automatically from Plaintiffs' paychecks. \n160.  Before the $35 per day value was set, Signal's Senior Vice President and \nGeneral Manager Ronald Schnoor recommended that Signal charge the workers even more, \n$53.50 per day, an amount that would have amortized the entire multi-million dollar cost of the \ncamps in Pascagoula, Mississippi and Orange, Texas in just ten months. \n161.  In the email containing this recommendation, Schnoor stated that Plaintiffs \nand their fellow workers would all be \"happy campers\" because Signal's living arrangements and \nwages were likely to be an improvement over conditions in India, in that Plaintiffs' net pay, after \ntaxes and living expenses, would be \"nearly 11 times more per day than they are currently \nmaking,\" that \"[a]ll they'll have to do is roll out of bed and walk to work,\" and that \"[v ]irtually \neverything else is taken care of for them.\" \n162.  After a short time in the camp, workers (including certain Plaintiffs) began \ncomplaining about the poor conditions and asked to live outside the camp.  In response, Signal \ninformed Plaintiffs that if they lived elsewhere, there would be no transportation to bring them to \nwork and that Signal would continue to deduct $35 per day from their paychecks. \n163.  Given their substantial debts, this wage deduction left Plaintiffs with no \nchoice but to remain at the camp. \n164.  By exploiting Plaintiffs' tenuous financial position, heavy debt load, \nprecarious immigration situation and fear of job loss, Signal assured that Plaintiffs and their \nIndian coworkers would have no choice but to continue working at the company and living at the \nPascagoula camp. \n26 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 27 of 123\n165.  Signal did not require any non-Indian workers to pay for Signal's capital \nexpenditures, nor did it require any non-Indian workers to pay for living expenses while they \nwere not living in Signal-provided housing. \n166.  In contrast, workers who were not of Indian race, ethnicity or nationality \nwere not required, or even allowed, to live in Signal housing, and were not forced to pay for \nroom and board at the camp. \nDiscrimination Due To Race, Ethnicity, Religion And Nationality \n167.  Signal employees, including supervisors, frequently used offensive and \nracist language in speaking or referring to Plaintiffs and other Indian workers. \n168.  In an email to other Signal personnel, Signal employee Darrell Snyder said \nthat it was a \"misguided notion that some of these Indians can be reasoned with\" and said that if \nhe \"stayed involved with the camp,\" he would \"most definitely go on a rat hunt\" in the camp to \nfind the \"very small number [of] these employees [who 1a re not going to change and ... need to \ngo.\" \n169.  Signal also disrespected Plaintiffs' religious beliefs.  For example, Plaintiff \nShaikh, a Muslim, asked for time and a small space to pray.  Signal denied his request, such that \nShaikh prayed very early in the morning -- before the start of the work day --and at night after \nwork, in his cramped housing unit. \n170.  Additionally, the religious beliefs of many Plaintiffs prohibit the \nconsumption of beef or pork.  Rather than accommodating Plaintiffs' religious dietary \nrestrictions, Signal continued to serve beef and pork, so that on some days, certain Plaintiffs \ncould not eat without violating their religious beliefs. \n171.  Signal also forced Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, to work under \nconditions that were harder and more dangerous than the jobs Signal assigned to non-Indian \n27 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 28 of 123\nworkers.  For example, Indian workers were assigned to work in small, smoke-filled tanks that \nlacked ventilation or in oily places on the rigs where it was easy to fall.  Workers not of Indian \nrace, ethnicity or nationality were not given such dangerous work. \n172.  When Indian workers complained about these unsafe and illegal \nconditions, Signal demoted them, suspended them without payor threatened to deport them. \nPlaintiffs were told that some workers who had complained about the working conditions were \nsent back to India.  Workers not oflndian race, ethnicity or nationality were not treated this way. \n173.  Defendants' discriminatory treatment of Plaintiffs and other Indian \nworkers was motivated by racial, ethnic and religious animus, as well as an animus against those \nof Indian national origin. \nSignal, Dewan And Buruett Continued To Mislead Plaintiffs \n174.  At the camp in Mississippi, Malvern Burnett and Signal personnel \nfrequently met with workers who asked about their applications for green cards.  During these \nmeetings, Plaintiffs and other workers told Signal personnel that Dewan, Burnett, Global \nResources and Signal personnel in India had promised that Signal would apply for and help the \nworkers obtain green cards and that the workers had paid as much as $16,000 for that \nopportunity. \n175.  Rather than tell these workers that Signal had not applied for green cards \non their behalf, and had no intention to do so, Signal continued to deceive the workers into \nbelieving that Signal would apply for and help them obtain green cards, telling Plaintiffs that \ntheir green card applications were processing. \n176.  In or about January 2007, Sachin Dewan and Malvern Burnett traveled to \nthe camp and, with Signal personnel present, told Plaintiffs and other Indian workers that Signal \nwould provide each Indian worker, including Plaintiffs, with a green card. \n28 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 29 of 123\n177.  Beginning before this meeting and continuing throughout 2007, Signal \nemployees consulted with each other and with Signal's agents about what to tell workers, \nincluding Plaintiffs, about the status of their visas and green card applications. \n178.  Although Burnett agreed to assist in filing green card applications on \nbehalf of Plaintiffs in exchange for the fees they paid him, he never did so.  Further, after \nPlaintiffs arrived in the United States and began working for Signal on H-2B visas, Burnett \nrefused to file green card applications on their behalf, or insisted on being paid even more money \nto do so. \n179.  Burnett had represented to the Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, that no \nadditional fees would be required for his immigration services beyond those paid in India. \nHowever, after their arrival, Burnett charged the workers additional amounts for advice \nconcerning immigration to the United States. \n180.  After one worker stopped payment on a check to Burnett in December \n2006, Burnett considered threatening Plaintiffs and other workers with \"immediate deportation\" \nto prevent other stopped payments. \n181.  In sum, Signal personnel, along with Dewan and Burnett, continued to \nfalsely represent to Plaintiffs that Signal would sponsor their green card applications even when \nPlaintiffs were already in Mississippi working for Signal on H-2B visas. \n182.  Signal also did nothing to address the fact that Plaintiffs' temporary \nemployment at Signal was not economically justifiable in light of the debt Plaintiffs had incurred \nand the mandatory $35 per day deduction for room and board. \n29 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 30 of 123\n183.  By November 2006, shortly after the first workers arrived in Pascagoula, \nSignal personnel learned that each worker had paid high recruitment fees to Dewan, Global \nResources and Burnett. \n184.  After learning of the fees, Signal terminated its relationship with Global \nResources, but continued to work with Dewan and Burnett. \n185.  Signal personnel believed that these fees were excessive and caused low \nmorale among the Indian workers, but Signal did not solve this problem and did not take steps to \nstop Dewan and Burnett from collecting those fees. \n186.  Signal sent a letter to Dewan and Burnett asking them to refund half of the \nfees that they had received, but Signal did not terminate its relationship with Dewan or Burnett, \nand Signal did not impose any penalty or withhold any payment when Dewan and Burnett \nrefused to comply.  Nor did Signal take action after Burnett asserted to Signal that Dewan had \nrefunded the workers' money, and furnished affidavits signed by workers stating that they never \npaid any fees, even though Signal personnel believed that both claims were false. \n187.  Even after learning of the high recruitment fees, Signal continued to hire \nworkers, including certain Plaintiffs, through Dewan and Burnett. \n188.  Signal did not itself refund the fees or mitigate the costs incurred by \nPlaintiffs because of the fees. \n189.  Signal's inaction after discovering the fees, coupled with its decision to \ncontinue working with Dewan and Burnett after learning of the fees, ratified the conduct of its \nagents. \n30 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 31 of 123\nSignal Attempted To Send Several Workers Back To \nIndia To Intimidate PlaintiflS And Deter Further Complaints \n190.  By spring 2007, Plaintiffs began to consider ways to convince Signal to \nimprove the conditions and sought outside advice from attorneys and local churches. \n191.  Signal intentionally created a climate offear and intimidation to cause \nPlaintiffs to stop complaining about the camp and their treatment at Signal. \n192.  Signal personnel told the Indian workers that if they got out of line or \nasked too many questions, Signal would prevent them from receiving their promised green cards \nand would prevent them from accessing their bank accounts.  When Signal learned that some \nworkers had contacted an attorney, Signal threatened to send the most vocal workers back to \nIndia. \n193.  Sachin Dewan called the wife of one vocal worker, Sabulal Vijayan, in \nIndia, warning her to tell her husband to stop making trouble at Signal.  As Plaintiffs and other \nworkers learned of this call, they began to fear that Defendants would retaliate against them and \ntheir families if they complained about the living and working conditions at Signal or tried to \nleave.  For example, Plaintiff Shaw learned of this threat and became concerned that Sachin \nDewan would harass Shaw's family in India because Sachin Dewan was very powerful and well-\nconnected and knew Shaw's family address in India. \n194.  Signal escalated its pressure on the workers.  In a meeting with Malvern \nBurnett and the workers, including Plaintiffs, on or about March 8, 2007, Signal management \ntold them that Signal had powerful lawyers and would fight back against any \"organizing\" \nefforts, and that Signal would not extend any of the workers' H-2B visas if a single worker took \nlegal action against Signal. \n31 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 32 of 123\n195.  On the same day, Signal decided to terminate five of the \"camp leaders\" \nand forcibly send them back to India \"to make an example of these men to the other Indians.\" \n196.  Early in the morning of March 9, 2007, when the workers for both the day \nand night shifts were present at the camp, Signal locked the gate to the camp, blocking the exits. \nSignal personnel, including several security guards, then swept through the housing units \ncarrying pictures of the workers targeted for termination.  Because Signal personnel could not \ntell the workers apart from each other, they accosted numerous workers, including Plaintiff \nShukla, to determine whether they were among the people shown in the pictures. \n197.  By 6:00 a.m., Signal had identified the five workers, taken them into \n\"custody\" in a side room, and told them that they were fired and would be deported.  Distraught \nat what that meant for him and his family, one of the workers, Sabulal Vijayan,  attempted to \ncommit suicide by slashing his wrists.  Several Plaintiffs observed Signal personnel carrying \nVijayan, covered in blood, out of the side room. Several Plaintiffs saw the other four workers \nwho were being detained through a window and became frightened that they too might be \ndetained. \n198.  The incidents of March 9,2007, or \"Black Friday\" as some workers call it, \ncaused Plaintiffs to fear what Signal would do to them if they expressed concerns about \nconditions at the camp.  Plaintiffs believed, based on Signal's conduct, that requesting improved \nconditions or asserting their rights to the same would lead to arrest, imprisonment, bodily harm \nand deportation back to India. \nSignal, Burnett And Dewan Used Fraudulent And \nCoercive Tactics To Prevent Plaintins From Leaving The Pascagoula Camp \n199.  Even after Black Friday, Signal continued to use fraudulent and coercive \ntactics to control Plaintiffs and other workers. \n32 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 33 of 123\n200.  For example, Signal personnel continued to falsely assure these workers \nthat Signal was working on their visa renewals and green card applications. \n201.  Additionally, Signal personnel threatened the workers, telling them that if \nany of them filed a lawsuit against Signal, Signal would refuse to extend H-2B visas for every \nworker and would send all of the workers back to India.  Signal knew that this threat would \ncoerce the workers, including Plaintiffs, into staying at the camp, because the workers would not \nbe able to repay their debts if they were forced to return to India. \n202.  Despite the threats and false promises, more than 75 percent of the Indian \nworkers had left Signal's Pascagoula camp by December 2008.  Some were terminated.  Others \nleft oftheir own accord, sometimes escaping in the middle of the night without their belongings. \n203.  No Plaintiff received a green card through any efforts of Signal or its \nagents, none of whom ever even applied for a green card on behalf of any Plaintiff. \nPlaintiffs Each Relied On The Defendants' Representations \nPlaintiff George Paily Paulose ChakkiyattiJ \n204.  In or about February 2005, Chakkiyattil returned from a pipefittingjob in \nthe Middle East to his home in Kerala, India and saw an advertisement Dewan Consultants \nplaced in a local Indian newspaper, Malayala Manorama.  The advertisement offered jobs to \nskilled pipefitters in the United States, along with permanent residency for candidates and their \nfamilies. \n205.  Over a period of several days, Chakkiyattil attended an informational \nseminar at the Trident Hilton Hotel in Kochi, India, along with many other candidates.  There, \nSachin Dewan explained the opportunity to work for a company called J & M Associates. \nDewan's agent, Salimon, was also in attendance, along with Pol and Malvern Burnett.  These \nmen explained that the process for obtaining a green card would require payment of associated \n33 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 34 of 123\nfees, in three installments.  The cost was contrasted with the salary the candidates would receive \nfrom J & M Associates:  forty hours per week at $16 per hour, twenty hours per week at $21 per \nhour and a $60 per diem for a six-day work week, for a total of $1 ,420 per week.  Sachin Dewan \nhanded out offer letters stating these terms and conditions of employment. \n206.  After the seminar, Chakkiyattil received several phone calls from Dewan. \nChakkiyattil and his family had decided not to participate due to the high cost.  Dewan's agent, \nSalimon, convinced Chakkiyattil to pay a small down payment of 25,000 rupees that would be \ncredited toward the first installment payment.  In the meantime, Chakkiyattil could take the trade \ntest in Kochi.  Chakkiyattil agreed and paid the 25,000 rupees, in addition to 2,000 rupees to take \nthe test.  To cover these costs, Chakkiyattil sold his wife's jewelry and took out a loan from a \nbank at an approximate II percent interest rate.  Chakkiyattil passed the trade test and decided to \npursue the opportunity to work in the United States. \n207.  Chakkiyattil was required to make three installment payments, to be made \neach time to each of Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett.  Each time, \nChakkiyattil paid $1,250 to Global Resources and Malvern Burnett, and separately paid 55,555 \nrupees in cash to Sachin Dewan.  Sachin Dewan refused to give Chakkiyattil a receipt for the \ncash payments without imposing a surcharge. \n208.  On or about March 23, 2005, Chakkiyattil paid the first installment.  To \nmake the payment, Chakkiyattil sold his wife's gold jewelry from their wedding and borrowed \nfrom a lend ing bank. \n209.  For many months thereafter, Chakkiyattil received no communications \nfrom Dewan.  In or about January 2006, Dewan called Chakkiyattil's home to report that he had \nreceived his labor certification and that his second installment payment was therefore due. \n34 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 35 of 123\nChakkiyattil's family took out a second loan from the same bank and Chakkiyattil's wife paid the \nsecond installment. \n210.  Many more months passed without any word from Dewan.  Chakkiyattil \nfrequently called Dewan and received many excuses about delays due to the elections in the \nUnited States and Hurricane Katrina.  Chakkiyattil began to see new advertisements placed by \nDewan Consultants, again offering employment for the same positions as before.  He also heard \nfrom friends that Dewan Consultants had started a new recruitment cycle.  Chakkiyattil went to \nDewan Consultants' offices in Kerala at least four times, asking about the status of his green \ncard.  Chakkiyattil also asked for a refund and was told that Dewan Consultants already spent the \nmoney that Chakkiyattil had paid it and, in any event, if he were to get a refund, Dewan \nConsultants would keep 20 percent as a processing fee. \n211.  On one such trip to the offices, Dewan's agent, Salimon, told Chakkiyattil \nto forget about working for J & M Associates for now, since there was a new opportunity to \nwork for a different company in the United States on an H-2B visa for an additional 100,000 \nrupees.  This new company would instead process Chakkiyattil's green card and, after working \nthere for a time, he could return to India to bring his family with him.  Chakkiyattil could not \nafford to lose 20 percent of the money he had invested for this opportunity.  Desperate with no \njob and mounting debt, Chakkiyattil felt that he had no choice but to accept this offer. \n212.  Dewan's agent, Salimon, scheduled a second trade test for Chakkiyattil, \nthis time for the new company in the United States.  Chakkiyattil paid for his train ticket to and \nfrom Chennai for the test, costing him approximately 4,000 rupees.  Salimon and other agents of \nDewan Consultants attended the test, where Chakkiyattillearned about the new company, Signal. \nThe applicants were told that they would receive ten-month H-2B visas, which would be \n35 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 36 of 123\nrenewed for an additional ten months, and that Signal would complete the applicants' green card \napplications. \n213.  Sachin Dewan later instructed Chakkiyattil that his interview at the U.S. \nconsulate was set for November 4, 2006.  In addition to the fees he had already paid, \nChakkiyattil spent approximately 25,000 rupees preparing the paperwork for the interview, 5,000 \nrupees traveling to the interview, and was required to bring two demand drafts with him -- one \nfor 4,800 rupees and the other for 5,000 rupees -- to cover government charges.  Prior to the \ninterview, Chakkiyattil went to Park Hotel in Chennai to meet with Sachin Dewan, Dewan's \nagent, Salimon, Malvern Burnett and two Signal personnel.  Prior to the interview, Sachin \nDewan and Malvern Burnett instructed Chakkiyattil and the other applicants not to say anything \nabout the money that they had paid for the visa opportunity. \n214.  At the end of the consulate interview, the interviewer explained that he \nwould mail Chakkiyattil's passport to him at his home.  Chakkiyattil never received his passport \nin the mail.  Instead, he later learned that Malvern Burnett had somehow obtained his passport \nand given it to Sachin Dewan. \n215.  On or about November 26,2006, Chakkiyattil received a phone call from \nDewan suddenly informing him that he would be leaving for the United States the following day. \nHe was instructed to bring the third installment payment, the additional fee for the H-2B visa and \nall originals of his agreements and receipts with him.  With no time to prepare and take a train to \nMumbai, Chakkiyattil purchased a plane ticket for approximately 14,000 rupees and traveled to \nMumbai. \n216.  Upon arrival at the Mumbai offices of Dewan Consultants, Chakkiyattil \nwas asked for his original documents and receipts.  The documents were confiscated, and \n36 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 37 of 123\nChakkiyattil was told that he would not need them anymore because Signal, and not J & M \nAssociates, would be processing his green card application.  When Chakkiyattil demanded that \nthe documents be returned, Sachin Dewan told him that he would not receive his passport ifhe \nrefused to relinquish the documents.  Chakkiyattil was then required to sign additional \ndocuments that he had no time to read and did not receive copies of after signing.  He also \nprovided a thumbprint and was told that it was for his green card application.  With the pressures \nof his mounting debt and his impending departure time, Chakkiyattil had no choice but to \nacquiesce to Sachin Dewan's demands.  Chakkiyattil paid the third installment and received his \nplane ticket and passport.  Chakkiyattil rushed to the airport in a taxi to board his plane. \n217.  In total, Chakkiyattil paid over $13,500 to Sachin Dewan, Global \nResources and Malvern Burnett.  In addition to the fees and interest that Chakkiyattil paid, he \nalso incurred expenses totaling over $1,350.  To finance such payments, Chakkiyattil borrowed \nlarge sums of money and paid exorbitant interest rates, both from banks and a high-interest \nmoneylender with connections to organized crime. \n2 I 8.  At the Signal camp in Mississippi, the Signal personnel supervising the \nIndian workers often urged Chakkiyattil and the other workers to skip time-consuming safety \nmeasures, including steps required by OSHA.  For example, OSHA requires that anyone \nperforming Chakkiyattil's job duties work with a partner.  On many occasions, Chakkiyattil was \nrequired to do such work alone. \n2 I 9.  Chakkiyattil is a devout Christian and considers Sunday to be his Sabbath, \nduring which no work is permitted.  While at Signal, he was often required to work on Sundays \nin violation of his religious beliefs. \n37 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 38 of 123\n220.  In India, Chakkiyattil's family was harassed by Dewan.  At one point, \nChakkiyattil's ailing wife received a call from Dewan's agent, Salimon, urging Chakkiyattil to \nstop causing trouble.  In addition, his wife was being harassed by the bank from which they had \nborrowed the large sums of money to pay Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern \nBumett. \n221.  In or about April 2007, Chakkiyattil traveled back to India to take care of \nhis ailing wife because Signal did not have work for all of the workers.  The bank that lent \nChakkiyattil money threatened to foreclose on his home and evict his family, greatly distressing \nhis wife.  Chakkiyattil took his wife to a hospital where she underwent treatment and brought her \nhome thereafter because he did not have any money to pay for her to receive continued hospital \ncare.  With great difficulty, Chakkiyattil renegotiated the bank loan and paid down some ofthe \ninterest.  On or about June 13, 2007, Chakkiyattil returned to the United States and his job at \nSignal, still hoping for the opportunity to obtain a green card. \n222.  Thereafter, Chakkiyattillearned that Malvern Burnett had never filed the \nproper paperwork for Chakkiyattil and the other workers to obtain green cards.  Malvern Burnett \nsaid he was no longer able to submit a green card application for J & M Associates due to a \n\"conflict of interest\" which resulted from Malvern Burnett acting as the attorney for both Signal \nand J & M Associates. \nPlaintiff Chandrasekhara Pillai Rajesh ChemmanappiJ/y \n223.  In early 2005, while working as a pipefitter in Saudi Arabia, \nChemmanappilly first learned, through a friend, of the opportunity to work for J & M Associates \nin the United States and obtain a green card.  Chemmanappilly called Dewan Consultants' offices \nin Kottayam, India and was put in touch with Dewan's agent, Salimon.  Through Salimon, \nChemmanappilly learned that the opportunity involved obtaining a labor certification followed \n38 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 39 of 123\nby a green card.  Salimon explained that Chemmanappilly would be required to make three \ninstallment payments totaling 600,000 to 700,000 rupees.  Payments were to be made separately \nin demand drafts to Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett.  Because other \napplicants had started the process much earlier, Salimon told Chemmanappilly that he would \nhave to pay the first two installments up front and at once. \n224.  In or about mid-2005, Chemmanappilly paid the first two installments. \nThe first payment consisted of three demand drafts in the amount of $1 ,250 for each of Sachin \nDewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett.  The second payment consisted of three demand \ndrafts in the amount of $1 ,460 for each of Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern \nBurnett. \n225.  In or about February or March 2006, Dewan's agent, Salimon, called \nChemmanappilly's brother-in-law in India and told him that everything \"was good\" and that \nChemmanappilly needed to \"come fast\" for the job in the United States.  At the time, \nChemmanappilly had a good job in Saudi Arabia that he was reluctant to leave without \nassurances about his future in the United States.  After receiving assurances from Salimon about \nthe work opportunity and permanent residency in the United States, Chemmanappilly quit his job \nand returned to India in or about June or July 2006. \n226.  On his return, Chemmanappilly experienced further delays.  In the \nmeantime, Chemmanappilly was unemployed and not earning any income.  Finally, in or about \nlate October 2006, Dewan's agent, Salimon, contacted Chemmanappilly and told him of the \nopportunity to work at Signal.  Salimon told Chemmanappilly that while he would still obtain a \ngreen card eventually, the Signal opportunity was different than the J & M opportunity because \nhe would travel to the United States on an H-2B visa.  Salimon said they would need to transfer \n39 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 40 of 123\nanother worker's labor certification to Chemmanappilly at an additional cost to him of 25,000 \nrupees, and that Malvern Burnett would handle the papers for the job with Signal. \n227.  In or about late October 2006, Chemmanappilly attended a meeting at the \nHilton Hotel in Kochi, India where he was told the details of the Signal employment.  Sachin \nDewan explained that Chemmanappilly would travel to the United States on an H-2B visa, that \nthe visa would be automatically renewed after its expiration, and that Chemmanappilly would \nlater receive a green card. \n228.  In or about late October or early November 2006, Chemmanappilly \ntraveled to Chennai for an interview and trade test with several Signal personnel.  Signal \npersonnel told Chemmanappilly about the fabrication work done by Signal on oil rigs and that \nthe company would provide food and accommodations.  After the interview and test, Dewan \ncontacted Chemmanappilly to tell him he had been hired and would need to be interviewed at the \nU.S. consulate in Chennai for his work visa. \n229.  In or about early November 2006, Chemmanappilly traveled to Chennai \nfor his consulate interview.  Before the interview, Chemmanappilly met with Sachin Dewan, \nDewan's agent, Salimon, and Malvern Burnett.  Malvern Burnett told Chemmanappilly not to \nmention his goal of obtaining a green card and not to disclose how much he had paid for his visa \nopportunity because if he disclosed the amounts, his visa would be denied.  Malvern Burnett also \ntold Chemmanappilly that his H-2B visa would be extended twice and then he would receive the \ngreen card. \n230.  In or about late November 2006, Chemmanappilly learned that his visa \nhad been approved.  He traveled to Dewan Consultants' offices in Mumbai to pay his final \n40 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 41 of 123\ninstallment of approximately 200,000 rupees.  Upon making the payment, Chemmanappilly \nreceived his passport, with the H-2B visa affixed, and his plane ticket from Sachin Dewan. \n231.  In total, Chemmanappilly paid over $13,000 to Sachin Dewan, Global \nResources and Malvern Burnett.  Chemmanappilly paid for half with his own funds and \nborrowed the rest from his family and by pawning his wife's jewelry. \n232.  At the Signal worksite in Mississippi, Chemmanappilly was ostensibly \nallowed two breaks each work day.  Because Chemmanappilly worked 130 to 150 feet in the air, \nhe would seldom receive any break because the time it would take to lower him to the rig \nplatform was counted against his break and would consume the entire time allowed. \n233.  Chemmanappilly also learned that there was a chance his H-2B visa would \nnot be extended.  He sought out Malvern Burnett for advice, who referred him to another lawyer \nbecause Burnett now had a \"conflict\" from his work for Signal.  Thus, although Chemmanappilly \nhad paid Burnett up front for the legal work necessary to get permanent residency in the United \nStates, Burnett refused to complete the work and sent Chemmanappilly to another lawyer when \nhe needed assistance in securing his ability to remain lawfully in the United States. \nPlaintiffS  ukumar Moses Dokka \n234.  In or about April 2004, while working as a pipefitter in India, Dokka saw \nan advertisement Dewan Consultants placed in a newspaper offering the opportunity to work in \nthe United States permanently with a green card. \n235.  In or about April 2004, in response to the advertisement, Dokka visited \nSachin Dewan at his offices in Mumbai.  Sachin Dewan told him about an opportunity to work \nfor a company called J & M Associates in California and receive a green card.  Sachin Dewan \nexplained that obtaining a green card would be a two-year process, that Dokka would be required \nto make three installment payments and that the process would begin as soon as Dokka paid the \n41 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 42 of 123\nfirst installment.  Dokka would be required to pay the second installment after he received his \nlabor certification, and he would pay the third installment at the end of the process.  Each of the \ninstallment payments would be made in the amount of 55,555.55 rupees to each of Sachin \nDewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett. \n236.  Dokka did not have the necessary funds to pay the installments.  To raise \nthe money, he sold some jewelry and some land, but was forced to borrow most of the money. \nOn or about May 5, 2004, he paid the first installment in the amount of$I,236 to each of Sa chin \nDewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett. \n237.  After paying the first installment, Dokka did not hear anything about the \nprocess until January 21, 2006 when he received news that his labor certification had been \napproved.  He was told that the delay was due to Hurricane Katrina, and that J & M Associates \nwould be moving ahead with his visa petition.  Defendants instructed him that he needed to pay \nthe second installment for the process to move forward.  With respect to the payment owed to \nGlobal Resources, Dokka was told to have the check made out to Pol instead of Global \nResources.  On or about February 17,2006, Dokka made the second installment payments in the \namount of$I,250 to each of Sa chin Dewan, Pol and Malvern Burnett. \n238.  After paying the second installment, there was another long delay despite \nDokka's attempts to obtain information.  Dokka received no information regarding the status of \nhis job with J & M Associates or his green card.  In light of the uncertainty, Dokka accepted a \njob in Africa.  While working in Africa he continued to attempt to contact Sachin Dewan, Pol \nand Malvern Burnett without any success.  He eventually heard through friends that the \nopportunity to work at J & M Associates in California was over, but that there was an \nopportunity to work at Signal instead. \n42 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 43 of 123\n239.  Dokka eventually made contact and was told he would work for Signal \nand to return immediately to Dewan Consultants' Mumbai offices.  When he returned, he was \nsent to Chennai to perform a trade test for Signal personnel.  He was also told he would need to \npay an additional 20,000 rupees to pursue the opportunity at Signal.  Sachin Dewan took his \npassport and told him that Dokka he would return it once Dokka completed his payments. \nDokka again had to borrow money to complete the payments. \n240.  In or about November 2006, Dokka was told that he would need to visit \nthe U.S. consulate for an interview in connection with his visa processing.  He was instructed not \nto reveal to anyone that he had paid money in connection with the visa opportunity. \n241.  Dokka traveled to Mississippi on or about December 18, 2006.  At the \nworksite, Signal personnel treated Dokka and the other Indian workers differently than the other \nworkers.  Signal personnel regularly cursed at Indian workers and warned them that if they did \nnot work hard enough, they would be deported.  Dokka came from a poor town in India and lived \nin constant fear that he would be deported because he had no means of repaying the loans he had \ntaken out to pursue the opportunity at Signal.  He felt he had no choice but to do whatever he \nwas asked. \n242.  At numerous meetings held at the camp, Malvern Burnett continued to \nassure Dokka that he was working on obtaining his green card, and that Dokka would need to \nremain at Signal until the process was completed. \n243.  On or about November 25, 2007, Dokka left Signal. \nPlaintiff Roy Punakkattu George \n244.  In or about February 2004, while working as a pipefitter in Dubai and \nhome on vacation in India, George saw an advertisement in his local newspaper, Ma/aya/a \nManorama.  Dewan Consultants posted the advertisement and offered work in the United States \n43 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 44 of 123\nfor pipefitters.  The advertisement stated that the offer was for a permanent position and that all \ncandidates would receive green cards for themselves and for their families.  George was attracted \nto the offer because, while he had a stable job in Dubai, it forced him to live away from his \nfamily and this would allow him to work near his family. \n245.  George responded to the advertisement and registered to attend a seminar, \nheld at the Trident Hilton in Kochi, India in or about late February 2004.  Over 100 other \ncandidates came to the seminar seeking employment.  The seminar was led by Sachin Dewan, \nPol, Malvern Burnett and Dewan's agent, Salimon.  They told the candidates that they would be \nworking for a company called J & M Associates in either California or Mississippi.  They told \nthem they would receive their green cards within five months and all they had to do was pay \n500,000 rupees for processing.  Dewan demanded three separate installments -- each split three \nways between Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett. \n246.  George paid the first installment after the first seminar.  He asked for a \nreceipt and was told that the receipt would cost him an additional 5,000 rupees.  George paid the \nadditional cost to obtain proof of his payment.  To pay this installment, George used his life \nsavings of approximately 250,000 rupees, which he and his wife had been saving to build a \nhome. \n247.  After six months without an update from Dewan, George returned to \nDubai to work until Dewan told him his green card was ready.  While George was in Dubai, \nDewan informed him about a second meeting at the Trident Hotel in Kochi.  George sent his \nwife in his stead.  There she paid the second installment.  She also received a labor certification \nstating that George would be working for J & M Associates.  To pay this installment, George \nsold family heirlooms such as gold jewelry. \n44 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 45 of 123\n248.  In or about October 2006, Dewan called George and told him to resign \nfrom his job in Dubai because he would be departing for the United States soon.  Taking Dewan \nat his word, George returned to Kerala, India. \n249.  When George returned home, he waited another month with no word on \nwhen he would be traveling to the United States.  George then went to see Dewan's agent, \nSalimon.  Salimon informed George he would not receive a green card before traveling to the \nUnited States and he would not be working for J & M Associates.  Instead, Salimon told George \nhe would receive an H-2B visa and work for Signal, a company George had never heard of up to \nthat point.  George said he no longer wanted to go and wanted his money back.  Salimon told \nhim he could not refund the first two installments and assured George he would eventually get a \ngreen card for himself and his family.  As George had already quit his job in Dubai and needed \nto resume earning money to support his family, he had no choice but to accept Salimon's offer. \n250.  George then traveled to Chennai to take a trade test.  George was told to \npay 150,000 rupees in additional fees for his plane ticket and for new processing fees because he \nwould be working for Signal.  George did not have the additional funds and was forced to take \nout a high-interest loan to cover the costs. \n251.  After paying the additional fee, George was told that he had to go to the \nU.S. consulate in Chennai for an interview.  Prior to the interview, he was instructed to go to the \nPark Hotel in Chennai to meet Sachin Dewan, Dewan's agent, Salimon, Malvern Burnett and \nSignal personnel.  There Sachin Dewan and Malvern Burnett instructed George not to discuss the \npayments he had made in connection with his visa. \n252.  At the interview, George gave his passport to the consulate officer for visa \nprocessing.  He was told that the consulate would mail his passport back to his home.  He never \n45 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 46 of 123\nreceived it and was without his passport for a month.  George later learned that Malvern Burnett \nhad collected all of the applicants' passports and given them to Sachin Dewan. \n253.  In or about early November 2006, Dewan's Mumbai office called George \nand said he would be leaving for the United States the next day.  He was instructed to bring the \nthird installment, an additional H-2B visa fee and the originals of any agreements or receipts he \nhad received from Dewan Consultants.  To pay the third installment, George borrowed money at \nan interest rate of 8 percent, using written guarantees from Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and \nMalvern Burnett to enable him to borrow the money. \n254.  At the office, Sachin Dewan and the others confiscated all of the \nagreements and receipts, explaining to George that he no longer needed the documentation \nbecause Signal would now process his green card.  When George demanded to keep the \ndocuments, Sachin Dewan said that he would not return George's passport unless he relinquished \nthe documents.  George complied because he had no choice -- he was in significant debt and \nneeded to earn a salary in the United States to pay off that debt and support his family.  George \nthen signed several other papers he was not given time to read.  George immediately departed for \nthe airport to catch his plane. \n255.  George traveled to Mississippi on or about November 28, 2006.  At the \nSignal camp, George's housing unit was routinely searched by Signal personnel while the \nworkers were sleeping.  In George's time with Signal, he never saw a guard find any prohibited \nitems in his housing unit during such searches. \n256.  George was friends with Sabulal Vijayan, who attempted suicide on \nMarch 9, 2007.  George left the camp in or about January 2008. \n46 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 47 of 123\nPlaintiffR  adhakrishnan Kakkathiruthi \n257.  In or about late 2003, while working as a welder in Dubai and visiting his \nfamily in India, Kakkathiruthi first learned of the opportunity to work for J & M Associates in \nthe United States through an advertisement in a local Indian newspaper, Malayala Manorama. \nThe advertisement offered a permanent position and the opportunity to receive green cards for \ncandidates and their families. \n258.  In or about early 2004, Kakkathiruthi attended a seminar at the Trident \nHilton Hotel in Kochi, India.  Sachin Dewan, Dewan's agent, Salimon, Pol and Malvern Burnett \nwere all present and spoke to the many candidates in attendance about the work with J & M \nAssociates.  They said that the process involved obtaining a labor certification followed by a \ngreen card, and would take a total of eighteen months.  They said the job would be in a shipyard, \nearning $22 per hour, plus $27 per diem.  Salimon explained that candidates would be required \nto make three installment payments totaling 600,000 rupees.  Each of the three payments were to \nbe made separately to Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett. \n259.  The day after the seminar, Kakkathiruthi returned to the hotel and gave \nSalimon 10,000 rupees as a deposit to participate in the program.  On or about March 5, 2004, \nKakkathiruthi paid the remainder of the first installment, approximately 150,000 rupees.  He paid \n$1,234 to each of Global Resources and Malvern Burnett, and an equivalent amount of 55,000 \nrupees in cash to Sachin Dewan.  Kakkathiruthi then returned to work in Dubai. \n260.  Approximately a year and a half later, in or about 2006, Kakkathiruthi \nreturned to India.  Unemployed, he waited to hear about the green card that had been promised \nby this time.  Dewan sent Kakkathiruthi letters blaming the delays on problems in the United \nStates. \n47 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 48 of 123\n261.  On or about March 7, 2006, Kakkathiruthi's labor certification was \napproved and he paid the second installment.  He gave three payments to Dewan's agent, \nSalimon:  $1,250 in demand drafts to each of Global Resources and Malvern Burnett, and an \nequivalent amount of 55,000 rupees in cash to Sachin Dewan. \n262.  In or about late September or early October 2006, Kakkathiruthi contacted \nDewan's agent, Salimon, to tell him of an opportunity he had to work as a welder in Kuwait for \nthree months earning 225 dinars per month.  Salimon told Kakkathiruthi not to take the job, \nexplaining that there was now another opportunity to work for Signal in the United States with \nan H-2B visa.  Salimon reassured Kakkathiruthi about the green card processing and that after \nthe nine-month work visa, he would get a visa extension followed by the green card.  Salimon \nsaid Kakkathiruthi would earn $18 per hour working for Signal and $27 per hour in overtime \npay. \n263.  Shortly after this discussion, in or about October 2006, Dewan's agent, \nSalimon, contacted Kakkathiruthi and told him he needed to come to Chennai to take a trade test \nfor Signal.  Kakkathiruthi took an overnight train to Chennai for the test.  Several Signal \npersonnel were present and discussed the type of work Kakkathiruthi would be doing.  During \nthis trip, Kakkathiruthi also met with Sachin Dewan and Salimon, who again confirmed the \nprocess for obtaining a green card in the United States:  the H-2B visa would be extended twice, \nafter which Kakkathiruthi would receive his green card. \n264.  In or about mid-November 2006, Dewan's agent, Salimon, contacted \nKakkathiruthi to tell him he passed the trade test and needed to return to Chennai for an \ninterview with the U.S. consulate.  Kakkathiruthi took another overnight train to Chennai.  On \nthe day before the interview, Kakkathiruthi and several other applicants met with Sachin Dewan, \n48 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 49 of 123\nSalimon and Malvern Burnett to prepare for the interview.  They were told not to disclose the \nfees they had paid for the visa opportunity or their intention to seek a green card in the United \nStates. \n265.  In or about December 2006, Kakkathiruthi learned his visa had been \napproved.  He traveled to Dewan Consultants' offices in Mumbai to pay the final installment, \npick up his passport and plane ticket and leave for the United States.  Kakkathiruthi departed for \nthe United States on December 12, 2006. \n266.  In total, Kakkathiruthi paid over $13,000 to Sachin Dewan, Global \nResources and Malvern Burnett.  To make these payments, Kakkathiruthi borrowed 300,000 \nrupees from money lenders at an interest rate of 4 percent per month.  Kakkathiruthi also sold his \nwife's jewelry to collect another 75,000 rupees and borrowed 300,000 rupees from friends. \n267.  At the Signal worksite in Mississippi, one of the Signal personnel was \nparticularly abusive towards the Indian workers, shouting at them, cursing, and calling them \nnames.  When he approached, the Indian workers hid for fear that they would be subjected to one \nof his offensive rants. \n268.  In Mississippi, Malvern Burnett charged Kakkathiruthi additional amounts \nfor advice about his immigration status.  Malvern Burnett later abandoned Kakkathiruthi's \nrepresentation altogether, telling Kakkathiruthi that his engagement by Signal raised an \nirreconcilable conflict.  As a result, Kakkathiruthi had to retain other counsel to continue his \nefforts to obtain the green card. \n269.  Kakkathiruthi left the Mississippi camp in or about November 2007. \nPlaintiffJ ohn Abraham Kalampukatt \n270.  In 2003, Kalampukatt saw an advertisement placed in a local Indian \nnewspaper, Malayala Manorama.  The advertisement offered \"immediate openings\" for \n49 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 50 of 123\npipefitters in the United States, along with an \"opportunity for permanent residency visa for an \nAmerican company,\" a good salary and living accommodations. \n271.  In 2004, Kalampukatt attended a meeting in Kochi, India at the Island \nHotel.  Sachin Dewan and his agent, Salimon, led the seminar.  Sachin Dewan said his agency \nwould take care of all the paperwork necessary for those at the meeting to go to the United States \nin eighteen to twenty-four months.  Sachin Dewan said the entire process would cost 550,000 \nrupees for each man at the meeting.  This fee would cover visa processing expenses.  Sachin \nDewan also told those at the meeting that while they would receive a good salary and food and \nliving accommodations in the United States; if they were not happy once they arrived, they \nwould be able to find another place to work in the United States.  Kalampukatt believed and \nrelied on the things he heard at this meeting. \n272.  Kalampukatt made his payments in three installments.  Each installment \nincluded one payment to Malvern Burnett in a U.S. dollar draft, and a second payment in Indian \ncurrency of equivalent value to either Pol or Dewan's agent, Salimon. \n273.  Kalampukatt's first installment of two payments of $1 ,262 was made on \nMarch 24, 2005.  The second installment of two payments of$I,250 was made on February 14, \n2006.  The final installment of two payments of $1 ,460 was made on November 23, 2006. \n274.  During the recruitment process, Kalampukatt worked for a Korean \ncompany in Kuwait.  He spent approximately 150,000 rupees traveling to and from India to \ncomplete medical and trade testing during the recruitment process, as well as to attend an \ninterview at the U.S. consulate. \n275.  Before he left Kuwait, Defendants told Kalampukatt he would be going to \nthe United States on an H-2B visa rather than with a green card.  Kalampukatt said he would \n50 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 51 of 123\nprefer to keep his job in Kuwait and wait to go to the United States with a green card. \nDefendants told him this would be a mistake and he would have a greater chance of receiving a \ngreen card once he traveled to the United States. \n276.  In September 2006, Kalampukatt learned he would be working for Signal \nin the United States.  Once he learned a specific U.S. company was involved, he felt enough \nreassurance to take the opportunity to work in the United States with an H-2B visa.  Kalampukatt \nthen left his job in Kuwait and returned to India to prepare to leave for the United States. \n277.  In total, Kalampukatt spent over 700,000 rupees during the recruitment \nprocess.  He paid approximately 550,000 rupees to Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and \nMalvern Burnett.  He spent another 150,000 rupees traveling from Kuwait to India to complete \nthe required paperwork and testing.  To finance such payments, Kalampukatt emptied his savings \nand borrowed large sums of money from friends and family.  Kalampukatt spent these amounts \nbased on his belief that he would soon be working in the United States with a green card. \n278.  In or about late 2006 or early 2007, while working at the camp in \nMississippi, Kalampukatt witnessed a physical fight break out between two men in his housing \nunit after one man suspected the other of inappropriately watching him change clothes. \nKalampukatt believes this incident was a direct result of the cramped space and lack of privacy \nin his housing unit. \n279.  In early 2007, Kalampukatt's salary was unexpectedly reduced from \n$18.50 per hour to $15 per hour.  Signal personnel threatened to deport Kalampukatt to India \nwhen he complained.  The officials told Kalampukatt that his salary was reduced because Signal \ndid not have a performance report for him.  Kalampukatt, however, performed hydro-testing \nfunctions for which such reports were not available.  On information and belief, and based on \n51 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 52 of 123\nconversations with Dewan's agent, Salimon, Kalampukatt believes his salary was reduced as a \ntactic to send him and other workers back to India so that J & M Associates could profit from \nrecruiting new workers to fill their positions. \n280.  In early March 2007, Kalampukatt attended a meeting at a local church. \nKalampukatt was present on March 9, 2007, when Signal personnel locked up several workers. \nOne of those workers, Sabulal Vijayan, had translated for other workers at the church meeting \nKalampukatt attended days before and attempted suicide on March 9, 2007.  After that incident, \non March 12,2007, Kalampukatt and three other workers escaped the camp around midnight by \nclimbing the fence after Signal personnel returned to their quarters.  The men arranged for a car \nto pick them up once they climbed the fence. \nPlaintiff Thomas Baby Madakkameprathu \n281.  In early 2004, Madakkameprathu saw a newspaper advertisement for \nemployment in the United States.  The advertisement offered a green card, as well as the \nopportunity to bring family along to the United States. \n282.  In or about February 2004, Madakkameprathu further learned of the \nopportunity to work in the United States from friends who attended a recruiting event in Kerala, \nIndia. \n283.  In or about April 2004, Madakkameprathu attended a recruiting event in \nIndia led by Sachin Dewan and his agent, Salimon and Malvern Burnett.  These men told \nMadakkameprathu he could reside and work in the United States with a green card, and that his \nfamily would be able to join him.  Madakkameprathu was told that he would work in California \nfor J & M Associates.  He was told he would be able to come to the United States within \neighteen months and the program would cost 585,000 rupees, payable in three installments of \n52 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 53 of 123\n65,000 rupees each to Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett. \nMadakkameprathu did not understand parts of the presentation. \n284.  In or about April 2004, Madakkameprathu paid the first installment of \n65,000 rupees each to Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett. \n285.  Following payment of the first installment, Madakkameprathu was told \nthere was a delay in the program and that he would not be able to go to the United States until \nthe next year.  In 2005, Madakkameprathu was told Hurricane Katrina was causing the delay. \nSignal and/or Dewan offered to refund part of the first installment, but indicated that another part \nofthe first installment was not refundable.  Madakkameprathu did not want to lose part ofthe \nmoney he had already paid, so he decided to continue making the required installment payments. \n286.  In or about February 2005, Madakkameprathu paid the second installment \nof 65,000 rupees to Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett. \n287.  In or about November 2006, Madakkameprathu paid the third installment \nof 65,000 rupees to Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett.  Prior to making this \nthird payment, Madakkameprathu learned he would be working for Signal in Mississippi instead \nof working for J & M Associates in California. \n288.  In total, Madakkameprathu paid Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and \nMalvern Burnett 195,000 rupees each.  To make these payments Madakkameprathu sold gold, \nborrowed money from friends and family, took out bank loans and sold land. \n289.  In or about October 2006, Madakkameprathu interviewed with the U.S. \nconsulate in India.  Following the interview and while still at the consulate, Madakkameprathu \nwas required to give his passport to Sachin Dewan for processing.  In or about November 2006, \nMadakkameprathu received his passport back after paying the third installment. \n53 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 54 of 123\n290.  In or about November 2006, Madakkameprathu traveled to Mississippi to \nwork as a pipefitter for Signal during the night shift.  In or about March 2007, \nMadakkameprathu's salary was decreased from $18.50 per hour to $13 per hour. \nMadakkameprathu was told his salary was reduced for performance reasons, but he believed the \nreal reason was that the pipefitting work was completed and Signal needed reasons to deport \nsome of the workers to India.  Some workers that experienced similar salary reductions were able \nto negotiate a salary of $15 per hour and were allowed to re-take performance tests. \nMadakkameprathu does not believe any workers passed those re-examinations. \n291.  At the Signal camp in Mississippi, on the morning of March 9, 2007, \nMadakkameprathu woke to a loud sound.  He saw Signal personnel, dressed in black and \ncarrying guns, looking for certain workers.  Madakkameprathu saw the Signal personnel force \ncertain workers into the camp \"TV room.\"  After the workers were let out and told they were \nbeing deported, Madakkameprathu saw one worker with bloody wrists being taken out of the \ncamp.  That worker was shouting \"I cannot go back to India.\" \n292.  In or about April 2007, Signal personnel gave Madakkameprathu and \nsome other workers plane tickets back to India.  Signal personnel told these workers they would \nbe able to come back to the United States in six months and obtain a green card. \nMadakkameprathu did not accept the offer and moved to South Carolina. \nPlaintiffA  nthony Marian \n293.  In or about April 2004, Marian attended a seminar conducted by Sachin \nDewan, Pol and Malvern Burnett in Chennai.  During the seminar, Sachin Dewan stated that \nJ & M Associates was recruiting people from India to work in the United States.  Sachin Dewan \nstated that candidates would receive green cards.  He told Marian that if he was interested in the \njob, he would need to pay a total of 600,000 rupees in three installments.  Each installment \n54 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 55 of 123\nwould total $3,750:  $1,250 each to Global Resources and Malvern Burnett, and the equivalent \namount in rupees to Sachin Dewan. \n294.  On or about April 30, 2004, Marian paid the first installment. \n295.  In or about December 2005, Marian went to work in Russia.  While \nMarian was working in Russia, Sachin Dewan called Marian and told him to return to India. \nMarian quit his job and returned to Chennai. \n296.  In or about March 2006, Marian met with Dewan in Kochi, India.  At this \nmeeting, Marian received an approved labor certificate from Dewan.  Marian then paid the \nsecond installment. \n297.  In or about the first week of November 2006, Sachin Dewan told Marian \nthat J & M Associates would continue to pursue Marian's application for a green card, but that in \nthe meantime Marian should go to the United States to work for Signal.  Marian then attended \nand passed a welding test Signal personnel conducted in Chennai. \n298.  On or about November 24, 2006, Marian went to the U.S. consulate in \nChennai for a visa interview.  Before the interview, Sachin Dewan told Marian that he must not \nmention that he had paid money in connection with his visa processing, or else he would not \nreceive the visa.  Sachin Dewan also told Marian to pay the final installment of $3,750 to J & M \nAssociates and to pick up his passport and plane ticket. \n299.  In or about December 2006, Marian went to Sachin Dewan's office in \nMumbai and paid the remaining installment.  Marian then received his passport and plane ticket. \n300.  On or about December 18, 2006, Marian traveled to Mississippi.  Marian \nbegan working as a marine pipe welder and worked in unsafe conditions.

Whenever the Indian workers raised such safety concerns, Signal personnel would make \nthe workers leave the job site and return to camp without pay for the hours they missed. \n301.  At the Signal camp in Mississippi, the housing units were so cramped and \nuncomfortable, Marian slept on the benches in the camp cafeteria. \n302.  In or about the last week of September 2007, Marian escaped the camp \nbecause he could not bear the harsh conditions any longer.  One of Marian's coworkers helped \nhim escape by driving him away from the camp.  Marian left behind all his non-essential \nbelongings because he feared that if Signal knew he was about to leave, it might try to lock him \nup and have him deported.  Marian remains afraid of Signal's retribution. \nPlaintiffJ acob Mathew \n303.  In or about August 2004, Jacob Mathew was working as a pipefitter at a \nshipyard in Kerala, India when he saw an advertisement in a local Indian newspaper, Malayala \nManorama.  The advertisement offered an opportunity to work in the United States permanently. \n304.  In response, Jacob Mathew went to a meeting at a Mumbai hotel, where he \nmet Sachin Dewan, Dewan's agent, Salimon, Pol and Malvern Burnett.  Sachin Dewan explained \nto him that they were recruiting for a position with a company called J & M Associates.  The \nwork would be in a shipyard in California and Sachin Dewan described it as a wonderful \nopportunity.  He said Jacob Mathew could obtain a green card through the position, and that once \nhe had his green card he would be able to bring his family to the United States as well.  Jacob \nMathew was told that the job with J & M Associates would pay between $18 and $21 per hour \nand that he could make about $1,500 per week.  Sachin Dewan told Jacob Mathew that it would \ncost $12,000 to arrange for his emigration, a fee which he would need to pay in three \ninstallments of $4,000, each divided equally between Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and \nMalvern Burnett. \n56 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 57 of 123\n305.  Although he did not have the money they demanded, Jacob Mathew \ndreamed of moving his family to the United States and detennined to raise the money.  He sold \nhis wife's jewelry and used his mother's property as collateral to borrow approximately $8,000 \nfrom local loan sharks, called \"money lenders\" or \"blade men.\" \n306.  In connection with his first installment, Jacob Mathew was required to \npass a trade test.  Once he paid his first installment, Jacob Mathew was told that they would \nbegin the paperwork for him to obtain his green card. \n307.  Approximately one year after he paid his first installment, Jacob Mathew \npaid his second $4,000 installment in three equal payments to Sachin Dewan, Global Resources \nand Malvern Burnett. \n308.  After Jacob Mathew paid his second installment, a substantial amount of \ntime passed without him hearing anything about the status of his green card or the job with \nJ & M Associates.  When he eventually made contact with Sachin Dewan, Jacob Mathew was \ntold that the opportunity to work for J & M Associates in California was no longer available, but \nthat there was a new opportunity to work for Signal.  He was told that the Signal opportunity \nwould cost $3,000 more, including $1,000 for a visa and $2,000 for a plane ticket.  Jacob \nMathew felt he had no choice but to accept the opportunity because of the amount of debt he had \nincurred.  He was told that he would receive a H-2B visa, and was also assured that Signal would \ntake over the process of obtaining his green card. \n309.  In or about December 2006, Jacob Mathew traveled from Mumbai to \nMississippi. \n57 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 58 of 123\n310.  Jacob Mathew left Signal in or about November 2007.  He still owes \nthousands of dollars that he borrowed to pay Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern \nBurnett. \nPlaintiffS  baju Olangattu Matbew \n311.  In or about February 2005, while he had temporarily returned to India \nfrom his job in the country of Georgia, Shaju Mathew saw an advertisement placed by Dewan \nConsultants in a local newspaper.  The advertisement sought applications from welders, \nstructural fitters, pipefitters, pipe fabricators and marine engine fitters and offered a green card \nfor candidates and their families. \n312.  On or about February 13, 2005, in response to this advertisement, Shaju \nMathew attended a seminar led by Sachin Dewan, Pol and Malvern Burnett.  These men \npromised that the candidates would be \"fast tracked\" for green cards, which would only take nine \nmonths instead of four years.  The men guaranteed that the job would last two to three years and \nthat Shaju Mathew could work for any company and permanently settle in the United States, \nalong with his family.  Shaju Mathew was told that his spouse would be able to work in the \nUnited States.  The men said that the fee would be 500,000 rupees, to be paid in three \ninstallments. \n313.  In response to a letter dated March 4, 2005 from Sachin Dewan, Shaju \nMathew mailed Sachin Dewan copies of the documents required for his application, including \nhis passport, birth certificate, trade certificates, photographs and biographical form. \n314.  On or about March 23, 2005, Shaju Mathew signed a contract and paid \nDewan 55,555.55 rupees in cash.  He did not receive a receipt.  In order to make this payment, \nShaju Mathew had to sell a plot of land he had purchased using life savings he earned while \n58 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 59 of 123\nworking in the United Arab Emirates.  He also had to borrow $4,000 from local loan sharks, \ncalled \"blade men.\" \n315.  Shaju Mathew decided not to renew his work visa in Georgia.  He pursued \nthe opportunity in the United States so that he could have a stable life with his family there.  His \npast work experiences had entailed prolonged separation from his loved ones. \n316.  On or about April 8,2005, Shaju Mathew hand-delivered two checks, each \nin the amount of$I,266, to the offices of Global Resources and Malvern Burnett, each gave him \nreceipts. \n317.  In or about February 2006, in order to pay the second installment, Shaju \nMathew borrowed $3,300 from his father-in-law and friend.  On or about February 15,2006, he \npaid Dewan 55,555.55 rupees in cash and received no receipt.  He hand-delivered two checks, \neach in the amount of $1 ,250, to the offices of Global Resources and Malvern Burnett.  After \nmaking this second payment, Shaju Mathew signed an agreement saying his visa petition should \nbe completed within six to eight months, though it might be delayed because of a backlog. \n318.  On or about November 1, 2006, Sachin Dewan called Shaju Mathew and \ntold him the green card process was delayed but continuing, and that Signal had an H-2B visa for \nhim.  Shaju Mathew then went for an interview with Pol, Malvern Burnett, Dewan's agent, \nSalimon, and three Signal personnel.  These men gave him a written and practical trade test. \n319.  In a letter dated November 14,2006, Shaju Mathew was told that he \npassed the test and needed to pay the third installment.  To pay this installment, he sold his wife's \njewelry for $3,000 and borrowed $3,000 from a \"blade man.\" \n320.  On or about November 27, 2006, Shaju Mathew paid Dewan 55,555.55 \nrupees in cash and received no receipt.  He delivered two checks, each in the amount of $1 ,460, \n59 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 60 of 123\nto Global Resources and Malvern Burnett.  He was then told to pay additional fees for his plane \nticket and an 800 rupee MRV visa fee -- expenses Shaju Mathew thought were already included \nin the $12,000 fee.  He was also told to book an interview with the U.S. consulate. \n321.  On or about November 29,2006, Shaju Mathew received a telephone call \nto appear at the consulate in Chennai for an interview.  Sachin Dewan told Shaju Mathew to tell \nthe consulate that he only paid $100 in connection with his visa.  After the interview, Shaju \nMathew was told that his passport with visa would be mai led to his home. \n322.  Shaju Mathew did not receive his passport at his home.  Sachin Dewan \ncalled him and told him he had the passport and to pick it up along with his plane ticket at the \noffice.  Shaju Mathew does not know how Sachin Dewan obtained his passport. \n323.  On or about December 6, 2006, Shaju Mathew went to the office.  He was \ntold that his flight left that day and he did not have enough time to say goodbye to his family. \n324.  When Shaju Mathew arrived in Mississippi, the camp was surrounded by \nhigh fences, barbed wire and Signal personnel guarding the only gate. \n325.  In or about the end of October 2007, Shaju Mathew slipped on a wet deck \nbetween the housing units at the camp.  He twisted his ankle and his doctor excused him from \nwork until November 9,2007.  The medical insurance Signal provided did not cover Shaju \nMathew's medical expenses.  In or about December 2009, Shaju Mathew first learned of several \noutstanding medical bills in his name. \n326.  When Shaju Mathew left the Signal camp on or about November 12,2007, \nhe was unable to bring his personal items with him.  He feared Signal would send police to \ndeport him after he left. \n60 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 61 of 123\nPlaintiffD  avis Mathai Meletlan \n327.  In or about January 2004, Meledan saw a newspaper advertisement while \nworking in Dubai.  The advertisement described an opportunity for work in the United States and \nthe possibility of obtaining a green card. \n328.  In or about March 2004, in response to the advertisement, Meledan \nattended an informational seminar in Dubai led by Sachin Dewan and Pol.  At this seminar, \nSachin Dewan and Pol described an opportunity to work for a large company at a shipyard in \nCalifornia, and explained that a payment of approximately $12,000 to $15,000 was required in \nthree installments.  The payments would coincide with the three steps of processing the green \ncard applications.  Sachin Dewan and Pol said that they would handle the labor certification and \ngreen card application, and the process would take six to nine months. \n329.  On April 15,2004, Meledan paid a first installment of $4,500 in three \ndemand drafts of $1 ,500 each to Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett.  The \nsecond installment was made in 2005.  In order to make these payments, Meledan borrowed \nmoney from his brother. \n330.  In or about July 2006, Sachin Dewan and Pol explained that there was a \ndelay with the original employment opportunity.  Meledan was told of an opportunity at Signal, \nand told it would be an expedited process.  Sachin Dewan and Pol said Meledan would receive \nan H-2B visa and his green card application would continue to be processed. \n331.  Meledan was told that his two earlier installments were nonrefundable \nbecause the money had already been used for processing.  Meledan paid his third installment in \nor about October 2006. \n61 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 62 of 123\n332.  On or about October 31, 2006, Meledan arrived at the camp in \nMississippi.  Approximately five months later, Meledan saw a doctor because he was suffering \nconstant chest pains.  The doctor attributed Meledan's chest pains to the camp's unhealthy food. \n333.  One day, Meledan saw the picture of a worker that had quit Signal posted \non a board in camp.  Signal personnel told Meledan and other workers that the former worker \nwould be reported to the police.  Meledan remained at the camp because he understood that if he \nattempted to leave and work elsewhere, he would be reported to the police. \n334.  In or about February 2007, Meledan witnessed Signal personnel \nconfronting outspoken workers and threatening to deport them to India.  Meledan believed that \nhe would be deported to India if he left Signal. \nPlaintiffJ eegan Joseph Cheruthalakal Michael \n335.  In or about February 2004, while working as a pipefitter at the Kochi \nRefinery in Kochi, India, Michael saw an advertisement for Dewan Consultants in a local Indian \nnewspaper, Malayala Manorama.  The advertisement described work opportunities for \npipefitters and other skilled workers in the United States, as well as the opportunity to get a green \ncard.  The advertisement included the address for a seminar for interested candidates at the \nTrident Hilton Hotel in Kochi.  Michael called Dewan and spoke to Dewan's agent, Salimon. \nSalimon told him that the immigration process would take between eighteen and twenty-four \nmonths and that once in the United States, Michael would be able to work for a \"very good \nsalary.\" \n336.  Later in 2004, Michael attended the seminar at the Trident Hilton Hotel \nwith approximately one hundred other candidates.  Sachin Dewan, Pol and Malvern Burnett were \npresent and told the candidates that after an approximately two-year immigration process, the \nmen and their families, if desired, would be prepared to travel to the United States with a green \n62 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 63 of 123\ncard.  Once in the United States, the candidates were told that they would work for J & M \nAssociates for a salary of $16 per hour for about sixty hours of work per week, plus $21 per \ndiem.  The men were also told that in order to take advantage of this opportunity they would \nhave to pay, in installments, a total of about $14,000 each, as well as an additional $1,500 per \nperson for each additional family member they wished to bring along. \n337.  Soon after the seminar in 2004, Michael paid the first installment using \nmoney from the sale of his wife's gold jewelry and loans from local loan sharks, called the \"blade \nmafia,\" which he secured by putting up some of his wife's other gold jewelry as collateral. \nMichael made the payment with a $1,250 check each to Global Resources and Malvern Burnett, \nand 55,000 rupees in cash to Sachin Dewan.  Michael checked on the progress of his application \nevery month after paying the first installment and was told that Hurricane Katrina had caused \ndelays in the process. \n338.  In either 2005 or 2006, after Dewan Consultants' offices received \nMichael's labor certificate, he was asked to pay the second installment.  Michael again borrowed \nmoney from the \"blade mafia\" and paid in the same manner as the first installment. \n339.  In or about October 2006, Dewan informed Michael that the job \nopportunity was no longer with J & M Associates, but now was an opportunity to work for \nSignal.  Michael was told that he would initially be processed with an H-2B visa, but he would \nstill have the opportunity to earn a green card while working for Signal.  In order to work for \nSignal, Michael had to take two trade tests, the second of which was in Chennai in front of \nSignal personne 1. \n340.  On or about November 13,2006, Michael went for an interview at the \nU.S. consulate.  Before interviewing at the consulate, Sachin Dewan instructed Michael not to \n63 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 64 of 123\ntell the consulate about the installment payments or the green card.  After the interview, Michael \nreturned to the hotel and met with Sachin Dewan and his agent, Salimon, again.  Sachin Dewan \ntold Michael that the consulate would be sending his passport directly to Dewan Consultants. \nSachin Dewan and Salimon then told Michael to go home and promised to contact him when \neverything was ready for him to go to the United States. \n341.  On or about November 26, 2006, Michael received a call from Dewan \nConsultants' offices in Mumbai.  The caller said that Michael would be leaving Mumbai the next \nday to go the United States and that Michael should bring the third installment payment with him \nto Mumbai.  Michael had to fly to Mumbai at his own expense of approximately 14,000 rupees. \n342.  On or about November 27,2006, Michael arrived in Mumbai and paid the \nthird installment.  Michael again took out loans to pay the installment.  While in Mumbai, Sachin \nDewan also collected all of Michael's original documents and required Michael to sign papers \ntenninating his relationship with Dewan.  Michael then departed for the United States. \n343.  In total, Michael paid approximately $16,000 to Sachin Dewan, Global \nResources and Malvern Burnett, including testing fees, airfare and immigration fees. \n344.  At the Signal camp in Mississippi, a friend came to visit Michael, but \nSignal personnel would not let the visitor in or alert Michael that his visitor had arrived.  Another \nfriend infonned Michael the visitor was there and Michael was only allowed to meet with the \nvisitor in the parking lot outside the camp. \n345.  Michael is a devout Catholic but did not feel free to practice his religion at \nthe camp because Signal personnel insisted on taking the workers to a Pentecostal church. \n64 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 65 of 123\nPlaintiff Gopalakrishnan Unniampathu Vettical Nair \n346.  In late 2003, Gopalakrishnan Nair was living with his wife and two \ndaughters in Abu Dhabi and was employed at a steel plant there.  He was informed by friends in \nIndia about an advertisement Dewan Consultants placed in the Times Of India newspaper.  The \nadvertisement offered an opportunity for employment and permanent residency in the United \nStates for candidates and their families.  Gopalakrishnan Nair called the Dubai offices of Dewan \nConsultants and was told to attend a conference in Abu Dhabi. \n347.  [n or about January or February 2004, Gopalakrishnan Nair attended a \ngroup seminar at the AI Maha Hotel in Abu Dhabi.  Sachin Dewan, Manesh Dewan, Pol and \nMalvern Burnett were all present at the seminar.  They explained the process for obtaining a \ngreen card, that it would take eighteen to twenty-four months and that it would cost \napproximately $15,000, to be paid in three installments.  The candidates were told that they \ncould bring their families to the United States for an additional fee per family member.  Sachin \nDewan introduced Malvern Burnett as an attorney who would take care of all of the necessary \nimmigration paperwork and other legal formalities.  [t was also explained that the job would be \nthrough J & M Associates, would be at a shipyard in California, and would pay $18 per hour for \na minimum of forty hours per week, plus overtime.  The candidates were provided with the \nwebsite of the shipyard owner. \n348.  After attending the seminar, Gopalakrishnan Nair collected the money he \nneeded, traveled to Dewan Consultants' offices in Dubai and paid the first installment.  He paid \ndemand drafts in the amount of$I,222 each to Global Resources and Malvern Burnett and 4,500 \ndirham in cash to Sachin Dewan.  Gopalakrishnan Nair was also given papers to sign, which he \ndid because he was promised the green card that he sought. \n65 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 66 of 123\n349.  For almost two years, Gopalakrishnan Nair called Dewan Consultants' \nDubai offices for updates.  In or about December 2005, he was asked for his second installment. \nIn or about February 2006, after borrowing the money from friends, Gopalakrishnan Nair paid \n$1,222 each in demand drafts to Global Resources and Malvern Burnett and 4,500 dirham in \ncash to Sachin Dewan.  These payments were delivered to Dewan Consultants' offices in Dubai. \n350.  In or about April 2006, Gopalakrishnan Nair was notified that he had to \nreturn to India for final processing and preparations to depart for the United States.  In May he \ngave resignation notice to his employer in Abu Dhabi, and he returned to Mumbai on or about \nJune 15,2006. Gopalakrishnan Nair was unable to take a job in Mumbai because Dewan told \nhim that he needed to be ready to depart for the United States. \n351.  In or around October 2006, Gopalakrishnan Nair went to Dewan \nConsultants' offices and was told to pay his third installment.  Gopalakrishnan Nair told Sachin \nDewan that he did not have the money to do so.  Sachin Dewan told Gopalakrishnan Nair that if \nhe did not make the payment he would not be able to go to the United States.  Gopalakrishnan \nNair borrowed $5,600 from money lenders and an additional $1,000 from his father-in-law.  In \nor about the first or second week of October 2006, Gopalakrishnan Nair paid $1,435 each in \ndemand drafts to Global Resources and Malvern Burnett and the equivalent of $2,600 cash, in \nrupees, to Sachin Dewan. \n352.  At this time, Gopalakrishnan Nair was told that the job opportunity being \noffered was at Signal, not the California shipyard originally identified at the seminar in Abu \nDhabi.  He was also told that he could go to the United States to work for Signal on an H-2B visa \nand not a green card.  When Gopalakrishnan Nair stated that he did not want to go to the United \nStates on a temporary basis, Sachin Dewan told him that the green card he had been promised \n66 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 67 of 123\nwould take a very long time and, for the first time, said that Gopalakrishnan Nair might not \nreceive it at all.  Sachin Dewan promised that Signal would extend the H-2B visa and by the time \nthose visas expired, Signal would likely sponsor a green card application for Gopalakrishnan \nNair.  Sachin Dewan pointed out that Malvern Burnett was also the attorney involved in the \nSignal opportunity.  Sachin Dewan also threatened that if Gopalakrishnan Nair did not pay the \nthird installment and take the Signal opportunity, he had many other potential applicants who \nwould. \n353.  Faced with the threat of losing the money he had already paid (which he \nhad borrowed from friends, family and moneylenders), and losing the opportunity for ajob in the \nUnited States after having given up a good job in Abu Dhabi at Sachin Dewan's behest, \nGopalakrishnan Nair had no option but to pay the third installment for the Signal opportunity and \nits temporary visa.  Gopalakrishnan Nair's family and others from whom he had borrowed money \nwere relying on him.  He had no choice but to take the word of Sachin Dewan and others who \nrecruited him. \n354.  At this time, Gopalakrishnan Nair signed additional papers in Sachin \nDewan's office.  He was forced to do so under hurried and chaotic circumstances in which it was \ndifficult to find an unoccupied flat surface on which to sign the papers, much less read and \nunderstand them.  Because he had already been required to pay so much money, Gopalakrishnan \nNair had no choice but to sign the papers.  At this time, Sachin Dewan and his agents also \ndemanded that Gopalakrishnan Nair return the agreements he had signed earlier. \n355.  On or around October 15,2006, Gopalakrishnan Nair attended an \ninterview at the U.S. consulate in Mumbai.  Dewan had called him about the interview and \nbefore the interview, Gopalakrishnan Nair went to Sachin Dewan's offices.  There, Sachin \n67 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 68 of 123\nDewan instructed Gopalakrishnan Nair not to mention anything at the consulate about his \npayments to Sachin Dewan and that, if Gopalakrishnan Nair did, he would be denied a visa. \n356.  After the interview, Gopalakrishnan Nair's passport and visa was sent to \nDewan, and was not returned until Gopalakrishnan Nair made an additional payment to Sachin \nDewan, the equivalent of $868 cash, in rupees, for his plane ticket to the United States. \n357.  In total, Gopalakrishnan Nair paid over $13,500 to Sachin Dewan, Global \nResources and Malvern Burnett and incurred travel and many other expenses.  To finance these \npayments, Gopalakrishnan Nair borrowed large sums of money and paid significant interest. \n358.  At the Signal camp in Mississippi, Gopalakrishnan Nair was forced to \nwork under unsafe conditions in part because of the pace at which his team was demanded to \nwork.  That pace required them to perform several tasks in confined spaces simultaneously, \ninstead of consecutively, which would have been safer. \n359.  At work, Gopalakrishnan Nair was treated differently than non-Indian \nworkers.  Indian workers were consistently asked where they were going, and why, while non \nIndian workers would come and go without being bothered.  Gopalakrishnan Nair also observed \nIndian workers being punished with disproportionate harshness for small mistakes, including \nbeing verbally abused in front of others so that Signal personnel could make an example of them. \n360.  In his housing unit, Gopalakrishnan Nair slept on a top bunk right below a \nlight which had to be switched on and off constantly in order for other workers to come and go \nor use the bathroom.  As a result, sleep deprivation was a serious and persistent problem for him \nat the camp. \n361.  Gopalakrishnan Nair is a vegetarian and, in addition to the poor quality of \nthe food, there was often only one vegetarian option available.  In order to adhere to his \n68 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 69 of 123\nvegetarian diet, Gopalakrishnan Nair had to subsist on crackers and energy drinks that he was \nable to purchase for himself.  Despite how bad this was for his health, he had no choice.  When \nGopalakrishnan Nair and other vegetarians asked to live elsewhere, Signal personnel told them it \nwas not permitted because of the money Signal had spent to build the housing at the camp. \n362.  Gopalakrishnan Nair was repeatedly threatened with being sent back to \nIndia.  He was told by Signal personnel and Malvern Burnett that if he created any problems or \nperformed poorly, he would be sent back.  These threats became even more frightening after he \nheard screaming and saw the blood of a fellow worker who attempted suicide after being \nrounded up to be sent back to India.  After this incident, Gopalakrishnan Nair confronted Sachin \nDewan and Malvern Burnett about the conditions at the camp, but was told not to create any \nmore problems and that Signal knew who was causing the trouble. \n363.  Gopalakrishnan Nair left Signal in February 2008.  Gopalakrishnan Nair \nstill owes thousands of dollars that he borrowed to pay Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and \nMalvern Burnett. \nPlaintiffP  rakash Kuttiyil Chandrasekharan Nair \n364.  In or about December 2004, while Prakash Nair was working at a shipyard \nin India, he saw an advertisement in a newspaper offering the opportunity to work in the United \nStates permanently with a green card. \n365.  After seeing the advertisement, Prakash Nair called Dewan Consultants \nand spoke to Dewan's agent, Salimon.  Salimon told Prakash Nair to attend a seminar at a Hilton \nHotel.  At the seminar, Prakash Nair met Pol and Malvern Burnett.  They explained that they \nwere recruiting for J & M Associates for an opportunity to work at a shipyard in California and \nreceive a salary of approximately $14 per hour and $1,300 per week.  They asked Prakash Nair \nto provide information regarding his background and described the process of obtaining a green \n69 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 70 of 123\ncard.  They told Prakash Nair he would need to pay approximately $18,000 to obtain the job, \nemigrate to the United States, and obtain his green card.  He was assured that he would be given \nhis money back if for any reason he did not receive a green card. \n366.  Despite the high cost, Prakash Nair decided to pursue the job with J & M \nAssociates based on the opportunity to obtain a green card and bring his family to the United \nStates.  Prakash Nair was required to pass a trade test to demonstrate he was qualified for the job \nand was given a schedule for three installment payments.  The first installment was described as \nan \"advance fee\" or \"processing fee\" and was approximately $3,000.  Prakash Nair did not have \nenough money for the payment, so he borrowed money from friends. \n367.  After approximately six to seven months, Prakash Nair received a call \nsaying that his labor certification was ready and that he needed to pay his second installment. \nBefore paying, in an attempt to verify that the opportunity was real, Prakash Nair searched \nonline for the name of the shipyard in California.  After verifying that the company existed, \nPrakash Nair paid the second installment.  To make the payment, Prakash Nair sold land and \ntook out a loan from local loan sharks, called \"blade men.\" \n368.  After paying the second installment, there was a substantial delay during \nwhich Prakash Nair received no information regarding the status of his green card and his \nemigration to the United States.  In or around December 2006, Prakash Nair saw another \nadvertisement placed by Dewan Consultants.  Prakash Nair went to the seminar referenced in the \nadvertisement, and Sachin Dewan, Pol and Malvern Burnett were all at the seminar.  Prakash \nNair asked them about the status of his green card, and they informed him that there was no \nlonger an opportunity to work at the shipyard in California, but that there was a new opportunity \nto work for Signal.  He would need to pay the third installment plus approximately $1,200 more. \n70 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 71 of 123\nPrakash Nair was told that he would obtain a travel visa through Signal, and that Signal would \ntake over the process of obtaining his green card.  Prakash Nair feared losing the two \ninstallments already paid because he had no means of repaying the loans he had taken out. \nUnder these circumstances, Prakash Nair agreed to made the additional payment and take the \nopportunity with Signal.  He took and passed another trade test required by Signal and then \nsigned an agreement with Signal. \n369.  On or about December 5, 2006, Prakash Nair visited Sachin Dewan at his \noffices and was told that his trip to the United States would be the next day.  Sachin Dewan told \nPrakash Nair to bring all his documents with him.  On or about December 6, 2006, Prakash Nair \ntraveled to Mississippi. \n370.  At the Signal worksite in Mississippi, Prakash Nair was treated differently \nthan the non-Indian workers, who were not required to live in the camp and were given easier \njobs.  Prakash Nair also experienced harassment by supervising Signal personnel.  While being \nforced to work in unsanitary and unsafe conditions, he was repeatedly threatened that if he did \nnot perfonn well that he would be fired and deported. \nPlaintiffF  rancis Kottackal Ouseph \n371.  Ouseph saw an advertisement in Malayalam newspapers announcing job \nopportunities in the United States, by which the candidates would receive a green card for \nthemselves and their families. \n372.  Ouseph went to a hotel on April 4, 2004, where he was interviewed by \nSachin Dewan and Pol, with translation provided by Dewan's agent, Salimon.  Ouseph was told \nthat if he paid a total of 600,000 rupees to Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern \nBurnett, he would obtain a job and a green card in the United States. \n71 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 72 of 123\n373.  After Ouseph began making payments, he learned that he would be \n\" \nworking for Sign~ in the United States.  Instead of obtaining a green card, he was told that he \nwould now go to lhe United States on an H-2B visa and his green card application would be \nprocessed when he arrived in the United States.  Ouseph was required to pay 30,000 extra rupees \nto Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett because of this change. \n374.  Ouseph then attended an interview at the U.S. consulate in Chennai. \nBefore that interview, Ouseph was told that if asked, he should lie and say that he had only paid \n35,000 rupees in connection with processing his visa.  After that interview, Ouseph's passport \nwas returned to D~wan and Global Resources rather than to Ouseph. \n, \n37~.  Ouseph later attended a meeting in Mumbai with hundreds of other men. \nAt this meeting, l1e made his final payment to Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern \nBurnett.  His passport was then returned to him.  He was required to sign documents that he did \nnot understand, irjcluding one that said he only paid 35,000 rupees total in connection with \nprocessing his visa. \n376.  In total, Ouseph paid 630,000 rupees to Sachin Dewan, Global Resources \nand Malvern Burnett.  Ouseph had to take out 600,000 rupees in loans to pay this amount.  The \nloans included a bank loan with a 12 percent interest rate and a loan from a government \ncooperative with a 16 percent interest rate.  Ouseph also sold his wife's gold ornaments to pay \nthe fees. \n377.  In Mississippi, Ouseph worked for Signal on oil rigs.  Signal personnel \npushed him to work very quickly and threatened to send him back to India.  Signal personnel did \nnot always give Ouseph time to put on his safety equipment properly. \n72 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 73 of 123\n378.  On the rigs, Ouseph and fellow Indian workers had to do dangerous work -\n- such as work in 'filY or greasy areas where it was easy to fall -- and work with the heaviest \nplates.  Ouseph s~ffered a knee injury after a fall caused by the dangerous conditions and spent \napproximately $300 on medical expenses for the treatment of the injury.  Other men Ouseph \nworked with suffered similar injuries.  Two men fell into the sea from the rigs. \nPlaintiffP  urayiJ Arjunan Padinhare \n379.  In or about December 2004, while working as a welder in Kuwait and \nhome on vacation in India, Padinhare saw an advertisement in a local Indian newspaper, \nMalayala Manorr.,ma.  The advertisement offered employment for welders in the United States, \ni \nas well as assi~ce in obtaining a green card.  It instructed interested candidates to respond by \n, \nattending a seminar at a hotel in Kochi, India. \n380.  In or about April 2005, Padinhare attended the seminar, along with \ni \n3Sp \napproximately  other candidates.  At the seminar, Sachin Dewan told Padinhare and others \nthat they would have an opportunity to work for J & M Associates and that they would obtain \ngreen cards after working there for two years.  Sachin Dewan told Padinhare and others that they \nwould need to pay fees and take a trade test.  Padinhare paid 4,000 rupees and took the required \ntest.  In addition, Padinhare paid 2,000 rupees to take a medical exam, which Sachin Dewan \nrequired.  Padinh$Te received a phone call a short time later informing him that he had passed the \ntest and medical exam, and could apply if he paid additional fees to Sachin Dewan, Global \nResources and Malvern Burnett, in three installments each.  Padinhare then paid the first \ninstallment, payiJjg $1,258 each to Global Resources and Malvern Burnett by a demand draft and \n50,000 rupees in cash to Sachin Dewan.  To make the payment, Padinhare borrowed 200,000 \nrupees from a barik. \n73 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 74 of 123\n381.  In or about February 2006, Sachin Dewan called Padinhare to inform him \nthat his labor certificate was ready.  Padinhare again traveled to Kochi, where Malvern Burnett \nconfirmed that Padinhare would be able to obtain a green card after working for J & M \nAssociates in the United States for two years.  Padinhare then paid a second installment of \n$1,250 each to Global Resources and Malvern Burnett by a demand draft and 50,000 rupees in \ncash to Sachin Dewan. \n382.  In or about October 2006, Padinhare contacted Dewan to inquire about the \nstatus of his application.  He was informed that he could go to work for Signal immediately on \nthe same terms that had previously been arranged with J & M Associates.  Padinhare resigned \nfrom his job in Kuwait and again traveled to India. \n383.  In or about November 2006, Padinhare met with Sachin Dewan and others \nin Chennai.  Sachin Dewan stated that workers who had originally arranged to work for J & M \nAssociates could work for Signal instead, for the same pay, and that workers choosing to do so \nwould receive green cards after working in the United States for two years.  Sachin Dewan stated \nthat in order to work for Signal, workers would need to pay an additional 2,000 rupees to take an \nadditional trade test administered by Signal personnel.  Sachin Dewan stated that all fees would \nbe refunded to any workers who did not receive a green card within two years, but that the first \ntwo installment payments would not be refunded in the event that the third payment was not \nmade.  Padinhare took the trade test and then travelled to Mumbai.  Dewan's agent, Salimon, \ncollected Padinhare's passport and arranged for his interview at the U.S. consulate three to four \ndays later. \n384.  After Padinhare completed the interview, the consulate kept his passport. \nA few days later, Padinhare was told his visa and plane ticket were ready to be picked up from \n74 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 75 of 123\nDewan Consultants and he was required to pay the third installment.  Padinhare paid a third \ninstallment of $1 ,460 each to Global Resources and Malvern Burnett by a demand draft and paid \ncash to Sachin Dewan.  To make the payment, Padinhare borrowed money from a bank. \n385.  In total, Padinhare paid over $12,000 to Sachin Dewan, Global Resources \nand Malvern Burnett.  Padinhare spent another $2,000 for required tests and travel.  To finance \nthese payments, Padinhare spent his savings and borrowed 600,000 rupees from several banks \nand individuals, at high interest rates. \n386.  At the Signal camp in Mississippi, when Padinhare complained that the \nfood served was spoiled and that he could not eat it, Signal personnel told him that it was better \nthan the food in India.  Padinhare understood this statement as both a dismissal of his concerns \nand a cultural insult. \n387.  At work, Signal personnel would incentivize the Indian workers by \npunishing them severely -- forcing them to take unpaid leave for three days -- for minor \ntransgressions.  Padinhare believed this was because Signal personnel wanted to maximize the \nIndian workers' productivity and knew they needed to repay debts so badly they would be afraid \nof the punishment.  Padinhare was punished this way on two occasions, in one instance for \nsitting down while on a break. \n388.  In or about March 2008, Padinhare left the camp. \nPlaintiffS udbeeran Panayamtbatta \n389.  In or about November 2005, while working in Saudi Arabia, \nPanayamthatta's coworkers told him about an opportunity to work in the United States for Signal \nand obtain a green card for himself and his family.  These coworkers had applied for the \nopportunity and were working in Saudi Arabia while they awaited their visas.  The workers \nrecommended that Panayamthatta contact Sachin Dewan. \n75 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 76 of 123\n390.  In or about November 2005, Panayamthatta contacted Sachin Dewan and \nhis agent, Salimon.  Sachin Dewan and Salimon told Panayamthatta that the deadline to apply \nhad passed, but because some people had cancelled before paying the second installment, \nPanayamthatta could take their place if he paid both the first and second installments at the same \ntime, as well as an extra 25,000 rupees.  They also told Panayamthatta they would assist him in \nobtaining his green card and bringing his family to the United States. \n391.  Shortly thereafter, in or about November 2005, at Panayamthatta's \ndirection, Panayamthatta's brother met Sachin Dewan in his offices to deliver one payment \ntotaling 395,000 rupees -- to cover the first and second installments and the additional 25,000 \nrupees --on behalf ofPanayamthatta.  This payment consisted ofthree demand drafts made out \nto Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett. \n392.  In or about August 2006, Panayamthatta resigned from his job of eleven \nyears as a foreman in Saudi Arabia and returned to India to meet with Sachin Dewan in order to \npursue the opportunity in the United States. \n393.  In or about September 2006, Panayamthatta and Rajesh Chandrasekharan \nmet with Sachin Dewan in his Kerala offices.  Sachin Dewan told Panayamthatta that he would \nhelp him get a green card.  Dewan's agent, Salimon, also told Panayamthatta that he could apply \nfor green cards for Panayamthatta's whole family right away in exchange for an additional fee for \neach family member.  Salimon explained that, alternatively, Panayamthatta's family would be \nable to join him in the United States within two years. \n394.  In or about November 2006, Panayamthatta was called in to Sachin \nDewan's offices to take a trade test and attend a meeting with Sachin Dewan, Malvern Burnett, \nSignal personnel and hundreds of other applicants.  At that meeting, Panayamthatta and the other \n76 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 77 of 123\nrecruits were told they had two choices.  First. they could go to the United States immediately to \nwork for Signal on an H-2B visa.  That visa would last for seven months and would be extended \ntwice.  Signal would process the applicants' green card applications during the second extension \nperiod.  Alternatively, they could wait and go to the United States later with J & M Associates. \nPanayamthatta chose to work for Signal because he saw how long other people were waiting to \nwork for J & M Associates and a loan he had taken out to make the initial payment was already \naccruing interest. \n395.  On or about November 8, 2006, Panayamthatta appeared for an interview \nat the U.S. consulate.  Sachin Dewan told Panayamthatta to tell the consulate, if asked, that he \nonly paid $1,000 in connection with his visa processing. \n396.  On or about December 5, 2006, Panayamthatta went to Sachin Dewan's \noffice.  Because the consulate had mailed Panayamthatta's passport to the office, Sachin Dewan \nhad possession of Panayamthatta's passport.  Sachin Dewan required Panayamthatta to make the \nthird installment and sign several documents before he would return the passport.  Panayamthatta \npaid Sachin Dewan the remaining balance of 200,000 rupees in cash and signed the papers.  The \npapers Panayamthatta signed were in English and he was not given time to read or understand \nthem while standing in a line of 200 to 300 other people.  Panayamthatta felt that he had no \nchoice but to pay and sign in order to get his passport back. \n397.  Altogether, Panayamthatta paid approximately 395,000 rupees to Sachin \nDewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett and another 200,000 rupees to Sachin Dewan.  In \norder to make these payments, he borrowed 200,000 rupees from a bank at a 13.25 percent \ninterest rate.  Panayamthatta borrowed the rest of the money from friends and relatives. \n77 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 78 of 123\n398.  Upon his arrival at the Signal camp on or about December 13, 2006, \nPanayamthatta began working about seventy hours per week doing oil rig maintenance and \nfitting.  Panayamthatta worked in what he felt were unsafe conditions on the rig -- in significant \nsmoke and dust with no ventilation.  Although Indian workers complained to Signal personnel \nabout the dangerous working conditions, Signal personnel ignored their concerns and instead \nmade the Indian workers work more, sending away those that Signal personnel alleged were \nunderperforrning. \n399.  After working at Signal for approximately two months, Panayamthatta \nnoticed that other Indian workers who had arrived earlier than he had still had not received their \npromised green cards.  Panayamthatta asked Signal personnel about processing his green card \nand was told that they would begin that processing. \n400.  In or about early 2007, after workers began complaining about the living \nand working conditions at Signal, Panayamthatta observed that Indian workers who asked about \ngreen cards were threatened with deportation, and he feared that this could happen to him as \nwell.  Panayamthatta knew that he would be unable to pay his loans if he was deported so he \ncontinued to work for Signal until on or about November 27, 2007. \nPlain/iff Te/son Joseph Pazhampilly \n40 I.  In or about late 2003 or early 2004, Pazhampilly saw an advertisement in a \nnewspaper, Malayala Manorama.  The advertisement said there was an opportunity for people \nwith two years of pipe-fitting or welding experience to work in the United States and obtain \ngreen cards for themselves and their families.  The advertisement stated that candidates would be \npaid $21 per hour. \n402.  In or about 2004, prompted by the advertisement, Pazhampilly attended a \nseminar at a hotel in Kerala, India.  The seminar was led by Sachin Dewan and Pol, with \n78 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 79 of 123\ntranslation by Dewan's agent, Salimon.  These men explained that Pazhampilly would have to \npay 500,000 rupees for paperwork and processing, and told him that he would be getting a green \ncard and a salary of $18 per hour plus per diem, for a total of approximately $21 per hour. \n403.  Pazhampilly paid a total of approximately 600,000 rupees to Sachin \nDewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett during the recruitment period.  To finance his \nthree installment payments, Pazhampilly sold personal items and took out a series of loans.  For \nthe first installment, he borrowed 155,000 rupees from a friend, at 10 percent interest.  For the \nsecond installment, he borrowed another 155,000 rupees, at 10 percent interest, from a bank.  He \nput some of his wife's gold jewelry up as collateral for this loan.  He sold additional jewelry for \napproximately 55,000 rupees.  He also borrowed approximately 15,000 to 20,000 rupees from \nhis brother, at no interest.  For the third installment, he mortgaged his house and land for a \n210,000-rupee loan from a bank, at 12 percent interest. \n404.  For nearly two years after Pazhampilly attended the seminar and paid the \nfirst two installments, the opportunity to work in the United States did not arise.  During this \ntime, the tension and stress from his loans caused Pazhampilly to require medication for high \nblood pressure.  Pazhampilly had never previously had problems with his blood pressure. \nDuring this time, Sachin Dewan and his agent, Salimon, continued to assure Pazhampilly that \neverything was still in process. \n405.  In late 2006, Salimon called Pazhampilly to say there was a new \nopportunity, with immediate availability, to go to the United States on an H-2B visa to work for \nSignal.  Dewan told Pazhampilly that Signal would provide room and board free of charge, and \nthat he would have the opportunity to work overtime. \n79 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 80 of 123\n406.  Prior to Pazhampilly's interview at the U.S. consulate during the Hยท2B \nvisa process, Sachin Dewan told Pazhampilly to lie about the amount of money he paid in \nconnection with his visa processing.  Pazhampilly was instructed to say, ifasked, that he had \npaid only 5,000 rupees.  He was also asked to sign a document indicating that Dewan and Global \nResources had not collected any money from him.  At this time, Pazhampilly thought that he was \nbeing cheated, but he fe It coerced to sign the document because there were strong men with \nSachin Dewan.  Pazhampilly believed that ifhe refused to sign, he would be beaten.  The \ndocuments that Pazhampilly signed were in English, and he was not given time to attempt to read \nthem. \n407.  Sachin Dewan was in possession of Pazhampilly's passport after the \nconsulate interview.  Sachin Dewan did not return the passport to Pazhampilly until after \nPazhampilly paid the final installment. \n408.  In Mississippi, Signal personnel routinely threatened to send Indian \nworkers back to India.  Pazhampilly was afraid to go back to India because his loans were so \nlarge, and he would have no way of paying them if he was in India. \n409.  Pazhampilly saw rats in his housing unit in the camp. \n4 10.  While Pazhampilly was working at Signal, he asked about the status of his \ngreen card application.  He was told that ifhe did his work well, Signal would get him a green \ncard.  At one point, Sachin Dewan came to the camp and said the same thing. \nPlainfiffSreekumar Janardhanan Pi/lai \n411.  In or about December 2003, Pillai was working as a welder in Dubai when \nhe saw an advertisement Dewan Consultants placed in Gulf News offering the opportunity to \nimmigrate to the United States with a green card, a job guarantee for two to three years with pay \n80 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 81 of 123\nfrom $4,000 to $5,000 per month and permanent lifetime settlement in the United States for the \ncandidate and family. \n412.  In or about December 2003, Pillai called Dewan and spoke with Sachin \nDewan, Manesh Dewan and Varuna Dewan.  He was told that the process of immigrating to the \nUnited States would take eighteen months and he would receive a labor certification, then an 1-\n140, then a work permit, and finally a green card.  He was interviewed over the phone and told \nhe would work for J & M Associates for a salary of $20 per hour.  Sachin Dewan told Pillai that \nthe total cost would be approximately $14,294. \n413.  On or about January 7, 2004, Pillai paid Manesh Dewan the first \ninstallment of approximately $3,676 in cash. \n414.  On or about February 18, 2006, Pillai paid a second installment of \napproximately $3,676 in three equal payments of $1 ,225 to each of Sachin Dewan, Global \nResources and Malvern Burnett. \n415.  To make the payments, Pillai took out a loan at II percent interest from \nlocal loan sharks, called \"blade men,\" and used family jewelry as collateral.  In or about 2008, \nPillai defaulted on the loan, and the \"blade men\" took the jewelry and threatened his and his \nfamily's lives and property in an altercation.  Pillai's father subsequently suffered a heart attack. \n416.  In or about December 2006, Sachin Dewan told Pillai that the opportunity \nto work for J & M Associates was no longer available and that Pillai should accept a new \nopportunity with Signal.  The new opportunity would cost an additional $1,000.  Pillai refused \nand demanded a refund of his payments.  Sachin Dewan refused to return any money and \nthreatened that Pillai would lose all of his money ifhe did not accept the opportunity with Signal. \nSachin Dewan gave Pillai one hour to decide.  In addition to losing the two installments already \n81 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 82 of 123\npaid, Pillai feared for his life and the lives of his family if he could not get a job in the United \nStates and pay the \"blade men.\"  He agreed to take the opportunity with Signal under these \ncircumstances. \n417.  In or about 2006, Sachin Dewan instructed Pillai to go to Chennai to take \na test.  Pillai and many other applicants attended the test, and Sachin Dewan, Pol and four Signal \npersonnel were present.  Sachin Dewan publicly promised that Signal would obtain green cards \nfor the applicants, but said the applicants would travel to the United States with H-2B visas. \nThis was the first time Pillai was told he would be receiving anything other than a green card. \nSachin Dewan also instructed the applicants to lie to the U.S. consulate at their interviews by \nsaying they only paid $750 for a travel visa and intended to return to India on July 31,2007. \nPillai paid approximately $113 for his consulate interview. \n418.  In or about December 2006, on the day before he was scheduled to fly to \nthe United States, Pillai met Sachin Dewan at his office in Mumbai.  At that time, Pillai paid the \nfinal installment of approximately $7,037 to Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern \nBurnett.  Sachin Dewan instructed Pillai to sign documents in English that he could not read. \nSachin Dewan did not allow Pillai enough time to translate them, or even ask questions about \nthem.  Pillai felt trapped and intimidated and that he had no choice but to sign the documents. \n419.  In or about December 2006, Pillai traveled to Mississippi.  At work, PiI1ai \nwas harassed by Signal personnel and observed other .Indian workers being harassed and \nsuspended from work for making small mistakes.  Non-Indian workers were not suspended for \nsuch mistakes. \n82 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 83 of 123\n420.

In or about March 2004, Raman was working in Dubai and saw a \nnewspaper advertisement offering an opportunity to work in the United States and obtain a green \ncard.  Raman contacted the telephone number listed on the advertisement and arranged a meeting \nwith Sachin Dewan, Pol and Malvern Burnett. \n423.  In or about April 2004, Raman met with Sachin Dewan, Pol and Malvern \nBurnett.  These men told Raman he could work in California and that he would receive a green \ncard after working for two years.  They also told Raman that the fee would be $11,250, payable \nin three installments to Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett. \n424.  In or about April 2004, Raman paid the first installment of $1 ,224 each to \nSachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett. \n425.  In or about June 2005, Raman paid the second installment of$1 ,224 each \nto Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett. \n426.  In or about November 2006, Raman paid the third installment of $1 ,250 \neach to Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett. \n427.  In late 2006, Sachin Dewan told Raman that he was required to pay an \nadditional fee of $3,000 for an H-2B visa.  Raman did not understand why he was required to \n83 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 84 of 123\npay the additional fee, but he paid another $3,000 to Sachin Dewan because he could not afford \nto lose the money he had already paid. \n428.  In order to pay the fees described above, Raman used all of his savings \nand incurred bank debt. \n429.  In or about November or December 2006, Raman interviewed with the \nU.S. consulate in Chennai.  Prior to the interview, Sachin Dewan instructed Raman not to tell the \nconsulate the fee amount he had paid in connection with processing his visa. \n430.  In or about December 2006, Raman traveled to the United States and \nbegan work as a welder for Signal in Mississippi. \n431.  In the United States, Raman asked Sachin Dewan for a refund of his \npayments.  Sachin Dewan refused to refund any money.  Raman also asked to live outside the \nSignal camp, but Signal personnel told him this was not allowed. \n432.  At the camp, Raman saw Signal personnel write down the names of the \nworkers that complained at camp meetings.  Such workers were often punished arbitrarily. \n433.  Signal personnel also threatened to send any workers back to India if they \ncorresponded with publ ic interest groups.  Raman had to sneak out of the camp at night to meet \nat a nearby church with a lawyer and others he believed could help him improve his condition. \nRaman was fearful at all times of being deported back to India, and he believed that if was \ncaught sneaking out of (or back into) the camp, Signal would forcibly deport him. \n434.  After he observed Signal personnel carrying a worker that attempted \nsuicide on March 9, 2007, Raman heard that an outspoken worker's bank account had been \nfrozen without any legitimate reason.  Raman believed that this would happen to him as well if \nhe complained about conditions at work or in the camp. \n84 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 85 of 123\nPlaintiffShawkat Ali Shaikh \n435.

The advertisement offered jobs to welders \nin the United States, along with \"[p]ermanent lifetime settlement in the USA for self and family.\" \nShaikh called the phone number on the advertisement, expressed his interest and was told to \nattend a group seminar in Abu Dhabi. \n436.  In or about March 2004, Shaikh attended the group seminar in an Abu \nDhabi hotel.  Sachin Dewan, Manesh Dewan and Pol were all present at the seminar.  Sachin \nDewan did most of the speaking and explained the process for obtaining a green card and \nworking for a company in California.  According to Sachin Dewan, the entire process would take \neighteen to twenty-four months and would cost approximately $12,250.  The job was to pay at \nleast $14 per hour with an additional $6 per hour to cover living expenses.  It was emphasized \nthat the candidates could bring their families with them to the United States.  Sachin Dewan \nexplained that the payments were to be made in three installments.  The first installment of \n$3,675 was due immediately.  The second installment was due once the labor certification was \nprocessed.  The final installment would become due once the green card was ready to issue. \nEach payment was to be split three ways between Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern \nBurnett.  Payments to Sachin Dewan were to be made in cash, and payments to Global Resources \nand Malvern Burnett were to be made in U.S. dollar drafts. \n437.  On or about April 9, 2004, Shaikh paid the first installment.  He was also \nrequired to sign some papers in English that he did not understand. \n438.  For nearly two years thereafter, Shaikh received no communications from \nSachin Dewan or others, despite his constant international calls from Abu Dhabi to Dewan \nConsultants' offices in India.  Shaikh estimates he spent $3,000 on such international phone calls. \n85 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 86 of 123\n439.  On or about March 11,2006 -- nearly two years after Shaikh paid the first \ninstallment -- he received a phone call from Sachin Dewan informing him that his 1-140 labor \ncertification processing was completed.  He was told that the second installment of$3,675 was \ndue.  Shaikh traveled with a friend to Dewan Consultants' offices in Dubai to make the \npayments. \n440.  In or about October 2006, Shaikh quit his job in Abu Dhabi and returned \nto India because Sachin Dewan told him he would soon leave for the United States. \n441.  In or about late October 2006, Sachin Dewan told Shaikh to attend a \nwelding test in Chennai.  About thirty minutes before the test was scheduled to begin, Sachin \nDewan first told Shaikh and the other applicants in attendance that they would not be working in \nCalifornia for J & M Associates, but would instead be working for Signal.  He said the applicants \nwould earn $18 per hour and would receive free room and board from Signal.  Signal personnel \nthen said they would handle the applicants' green card applications.  In the meantime, the \napplicants would come to the United States with H-2B visas.  Sachin Dewan explained that, \nbecause of the change in plans, the final installment payment would be more than the previous \npayments:  135,000 rupees in cash to Sachin Dewan and $1,460 to each of Global Resources and \nMalvern Burnett.  Sachin Dewan promised to return all of Shaikh's payments if neither Signal \nnor J & M Associates succeeded in obtaining a green card for him. \n442.  On or about December 2006, Shaikh went to Delhi to attend an H-2B visa \ninterview at the U.S. consulate.  Prior to the interview, Shaikh and other candidates were warned \nthat if they told the truth about how much money they paid in connection with their visa \nprocessing, they would not receive a visa and would not be reimbursed for any of the money they \nspent.  At the end of his interview, Shaikh received a receipt for his passport and was instructed \n86 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 87 of 123\nto pick it up with his visa soon thereafter.  Shaikh went to pick up his passport and, upon \nreceiving it, Sachin Dewan demanded that he hand the passport over, explaining that the passport \nwas necessary for Sachin Dewan to purchase the plane tickets. \n443.  Sachin Dewan refused to return the passport until Shaikh paid the final \ninstallment payment.  On or about January 20, 2007, upon payment of the full amount \ndemanded, Sachin Dewan still refused to return Shaikh's passport until he returned all of the \nreceipts and paperwork he had received from Sachin Dewan and others during the application \nprocess.  Shaikh said his paperwork was in Abu Dhabi.  Sachin withheld Shaikh's passport until \njust before Shaikh left for his flight on or about January 24, 2007.  In advance of the flight, \nShaikh was required to sign documents in English that he could not understand.  Shaikh was not \ngiven time to review the documents or to consult with an attorney or a translator. \n444.  In total, Shaikh paid over $13,800 to Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and \nMalvern Burnett.  To finance such payments, Shaikh borrowed large sums of money and paid \nexorbitant interest rates. \n445.  In Mississippi, Shaikh believes he was one of five Muslim workers in the \ncamp.  He and others asked for a small place to pray.  Signal denied their requests.  Instead, \nShaikh and others had to pray in the cramped housing units.  In addition, Signal often provided \nonly food containing pork, which Shaikh and others could not eat due to their religious beliefs. \n446.  Although Shaikh was never late for work, Signal personnel sometimes \npunished him with unpaid leave for three days when he took too long to use the restroom during \nthe day, even though the delays were due to the lack of adequate restrooms and the resulting long \nlines to use them.  On information and belief, Signal imposed these punishments because it did \nnot have enough work for all the workers and was looking for excuses not to pay people. \n87 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 88 of 123\n447.  On at least three occasions, Shaikh become ill while at the camp -- likely \nbecause ofthe unhealthy work and living conditions.  Shaikh saw a doctor at the Signal facility. \nThe doctor told Shaikh to change his diet and to tell Signal personnel to create more hygienic \nconditions in the camp.  Shaikh was not paid for that day's work. \n448.  After the incidents on March 9, 2007, Shaikh ceased leaving the Signal \ncamp or socializing altogether for fear that Signal would throw him in jail or deport him.  Shaikh \nbelieved that Signal was well connected with the police and could therefore exert control over \nthe workers' lives. \n449.  Shaikh left the camp on or about July 14, 2007.  After leaving, Shaikh \nheard from his wife in India that Sachin Dewan called her and threatened to kill Shaikh if he \nworked with the Southern Poverty Law Center, or otherwise participated in lawsuits.  Shaikh \nremains afraid of Sachin Dewan to this day. \nPlaintiffA  runkumar Shaw Narayan Shaw \n450.  In or about April 2004, Shaw was working as a welder in Dubai when he \nsaw an advertisement placed in Gulf News offering jobs for welders in the United States with a \n'Job guarantee provided for 2-3 years\" and \"lp] ermanent lifetime settlement in the USA for self \nand family.\"  That advertisement said that a seminar regarding the opportunity would be held at a \nlocal hotel in Dubai on June I I, 2004. \n451.  Shaw was unable to attend the seminar due to work commitments, but he \nheard about the seminar from coworkers who did attend.  These coworkers told Shaw that the \nspeakers at the seminar -- who Shaw later learned included Sachin Dewan and Pol -- offered a \ngreen card in the United States along with the work opportunity, and assured the candidates that \nall accommodations and meals would be provided.  Shaw was particularly attracted to the \nopportunity to become a permanent resident in the United States. \n88 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 89 of 123\n452.  On or about April 16, 2004, Shaw called Sachin Dewan and then went to \nthe offices of Dewan Consultants in Media City, Dubai.  In addition to Sachin Dewan, Varuna \nDewan and Manesh Dewan were also in attendance.  There, Shaw and several other candidates \nlearned more about the opportunity to work in the United States for J & M Associates.  Sachin \nDewan highly recommended J & M Associates as an employer and explained that Shaw would \nbe doing welding work for $14 to $18 per hour, plus overtime.  Sachin Dewan stated that the \nentire process, including the receipt of a green card, would take eighteen months.  In exchange \nfor this opportunity, Shaw would be required to make three payments totaling 40,500 dirham. \n453.  At the same meeting, Sachin Dewan explained that each installment \npayment, in the amount of approximately 13,500 dirham, was to be paid in thirds to each of \nSachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett.  The payments to Sachin Dewan were to \nbe in cash, with Global Resources and Malvern Burnett receiving payment in the form of \ndemand drafts in U.S. dollars.  The first installment was due immediately, with the second and \nthird installments due once the labor certification was processed for Shaw's 1-140 visa \napplication and upon issuance of the green card, respectively.  Shaw paid a portion of the first \ninstallment at that meeting and paid the remaining balance on or about July 17,2004. \n454.  Also at the meeting, Shaw met Malvern Burnett, who explained that he \nwould be Shaw's immigration attorney and handle the green card application and related \npaperwork on Shaw's behalf.  Shaw asked Burnett if it was a good idea to get married before \ntraveling to the United States, or if Shaw should wait to marry until after he moved to the United \nStates.  Burnett advised Shaw to marry before leaving for the United States because the \npaperwork and processing required for a green card would be easier if Shaw were already \nmarried.  Shaw took Burnett's advice and married in January 2005. \n89 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 90 of 123\n455.  For months thereafter, Shaw heard no news from Dewan Consultants \nregarding the status of his green card.  Shaw called Dewan Consultants' offices about twice a day \nbut never received any updates. \n456.  Over a year later, around the end of2005, Varuna Dewan called Shaw and \ntold him that his labor certification had been approved, and that Shaw had to pay the second \ninstallment in order to receive the labor certification.  Shaw paid the second installment as \nrequired. \n457.  In or about October 2006, Varuna Dewan called Shaw again, this time \ndirecting Shaw to take a trade test in Chennai.  She said that after the test, Shaw would learn \nmore about the process of going to the United States.  Shaw applied for emergency leave from \nwork and left for Chennai to take the test.  Shaw paid all travel costs out of pocket. \n458.  At the trade test in Chennai, Sachin Dewan and Signal personnel were in \nattendance.  Before the test began, Sachin Dewan explained that those applicants who passed the \ntest would be working for Signal, not J & M Associates, and that they would be receiving an \nH-2B visa.  Sachin Dewan explained that Signal would take care of both the H-2B visa and the \ngreen card application, along with J & M Associates.  Although this sudden change of plans \ndisturbed Shaw, he felt that he had no choice but to agree to whatever Sachin Dewan said, as \nShaw had already paid a large sum of money for this opportunity.  Shaw passed the test and then \nreturned to Dubai to continue working. \n459.  In or about December 2006, Sachin Dewan called Shaw and directed him \nto go to Delhi for an interview at the U.S. consulate.  At his own expense, Shaw traveled to Delhi \nwhere he met with Sachin Dewan's agents.  Sachin Dewan and those agents told Shaw and other \napplicants not to mention anything to the consulate about money that they had paid for the visa \n90 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 91 of 123\nopportunity and warned that if they did so, the consulate would decline their visas.  Sachin \nDewan also directed everyone not to mention the green card applications or J & M Associates, as \nthe interview was only related to the H-2B visa for Signal. \n460.  On or about December 12, 2006, Shaw appeared for his consulate \ninterview.  After the interview, the consulate gave Shaw a paper receipt to retrieve his passport. \nUpon leaving the consulate, one of Sachin Dewan's agents confronted Shaw and demanded that \nShaw hand the receipt and other paperwork over to the agent.  Shaw reluctantly handed the \ndocuments over, as he saw no other choice.  Sachin Dewan was an extremely powerful and \npolitically connected person in India with numerous associates.  Given the large sums of money \nthat Shaw had already paid, Shaw reasonably believed that he had no choice but to hand the \ndocuments to Sachin Dewan. \n461.  At Sachin Dewan's instruction, Shaw remained in Delhi for a few days \nlonger.  Shaw later received the passport receipt from Sachin Dewan, who instructed him to \nretrieve his passport.  Upon exiting the consulate with his passport, Sachin Dewan's agent \ncollected Shaw's passport.  Shaw became very worried about not having his passport because he \nneeded it to return to his job in Dubai in the event that he could not travel to the United States, to \ntravel to Dubai to properly cancel his guestworker visa and to collect additional money to pay for \nthe final installment.  Shaw called Sachin Dewan and asked for his passport back, but Sachin \nDewan said that Shaw would only receive his passport once he paid the final installment. \nBecause Shaw could not return to Dubai to collect money for the payment, Shaw used his wife's \njewelry as collateral for a loan. \n91 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 92 of 123\n462.  In or about December 2006, Shaw paid the third installment, in the form \nof cash to Sachin Dewan and a personal check to Global Resources and Malvern Burnett.  Shaw \nreceived his passport in return. \n463.  On or about January 23, 2007, Shaw traveled to Sachin Dewan's offices in \nMumbai.  At the offices, Sachin Dewan said Shaw and other applicants had to return all receipts \nand paperwork that they had received from Sachin Dewan in the past and sign various \ndocuments in English before they could leave for the United States.  Shaw told Sachin Dewan \nthat he did not have the paperwork with him and therefore did not return it.  Shaw was also \nrequired to quickly sign several documents.  Shaw was not given time to review the documents - \nwhich were in English and difficult for him to understand -- and was told they were merely a \nformality.  After Shaw signed the documents, he received his plane ticket, and traveled to \nMississippi over the next two days. \n464.  In total, Shaw paid over $11,000 to Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and \nMalvern Burnett.  To finance such payments, Shaw borrowed large sums of money and paid \nexorbitant interest rates, putting up valuable property as collateral for the loans. \n465.  At the Signal worksite in Mississippi, Signal personnel would single out \nthe Indian workers from other workers and hassle them whenever they wanted to take a rest or \nbreak for a drink.  The Indian workers feared that if Signal personnel complained about them, \nthey could be terminated, deported or worse. \n466.  On March 9, 2007, Shaw recalls seeing, through a window in that room, \nfour Indian workers locked in a room guarded by Signal personnel.  At a camp meeting \nfollowing that incident, Signal personnel told the workers that Malvern Burnett was a skilled \n92 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 93 of 123\nattorney who is powerful in the community and that workers who caused trouble would be sent \nback to India. \n467.  Soon thereafter, Sachin Dewan visited the camp.  Shaw had heard from \nother workers that Sachin Dewan had called the wife of the worker involved in the incidents of \nMarch 9, 2007, Sabulal Vijayan, and threatened Vijayan's life.  Shaw feared Sachin Dewan \nmight take similar action against his family in India because he was a powerful person there and \nknew Shaw's family address. \n468.  In or around the second week of July 2007, Shaw escaped the camp, \nfearing that when Signal personnel found out he left, they would send security or police after him \nand have him deported. \nPlaintiffSuhash Chandra Shukla \n469.  In or about February 2004, while Shukla was working in Saudi Arabia, a \nfriend of his told him about an advertisement offering an opportunity to immigrate to the United \nStates with a green card and a guaranteed job.  Sachin Dewan's name appeared on the \nadvertisement. \n470.  In or about March 2004, while Shukla was in India, he called Sachin \nDewan at his offices in Mumbai.  Sachin Dewan told Shukla that he would make significantly \nmore money at a job in the United States, that he would receive a green card and that his wife \nand children would also be given permanent residency in the United States.  Sachin Dewan said \nthe process would take nine to eighteen months. \n471.  In or about March 2004, as a result of these promises -- particularly of \nliving with his family in the United States and getting permanent residency -- Shukla signed a \ncontract provided by Sachin Dewan.  The contract was written in English, and Shukla could not \nunderstand it.  Sachin Dewan afforded him no opportunity to have it translated, and presented it \n93 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 94 of 123\nas a take-it-or-Ieave-it offer.  When Shukla asked questions about the contract he was told not to \nworry. \n472.  At the same meeting, Sachin Dewan told Shukla to pay the first of three \ninstallments of approximately $3,690.  The payment would be split in equal parts between \nSachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett.  Shukla paid Sachin Dewan a \"down \npayment\" of approximately $1, I 07 at this first meeting. \n473.  In or about July 2004, Shukla paid the balance ofthe first installment of \n$3,690. \n474.  In or about March 2005, Shukla paid the second installment of \napproximately $3,690. \n475.  In or about September 2006, Sachin Dewan told Shukla to go to the \nUnited States Embassy to apply for a visa because there was a problem obtaining his green card. \nSachin Dewan told Shukla not to worry because Shukla would receive a three-year visa and then \na green card when he arrived in the United States.  Shukla was furious and terrified because he \nexpected a green card, paid to get the green card and quit a great job on the promise of that green \ncard.  He demanded his money back, but Sachin Dewan refused to make the refund and told \nShukla that he would lose all the money if he did not proceed as directed.  Shukla felt compelled \nto settle for a three-year visa for fear oflosing his money and of what would happen if he did not \nearn a salary in the United States to pay off his loans. \n476.  In or about November 2006, Shukla paid the final installment, which \nSachin Dewan unexpectedly increased to approximately $4,321. \n477.  In total, Shukla paid a total of approximately $11,737.  To make the \npayments, Shukla emptied his family's savings, and took loans from friends and acquaintances. \n94 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 95 of 123\nTo this day, he has still not paid back the loans, some of which are accruing interest at a rate of 3 \npercent. \n478.  Two days after making the final payment, Shukla obtained his visa. \nShukla was shocked that it was only valid for ten months and not three years, as Sachin Dewan \nhad promised.  Shukla asked Sachin Dewan's assistant, Ramesh, about the shortened term but \nwas told not to worry because Malvern Burnett would take care of it when Shukla arrived in the \nUnited States. \n479.  In or about November 2006, Shukla traveled to Mississippi.  Throughout \nthe camp he saw posters with pictures of cameras that said \"I'm watching you.\" \n480.  Shukla's religion prohibits him from eating any meat.  Signal often gave \nhim no food choices -- either he could eat meat or go hungry.  Rather than starve, Shukla was \nforced to violate his religion by eating meat. \n481.  Signal personnel made threats to Shukla and the other workers.  They said \nthat if the workers got out ofline or asked too many questions, Signal would stop them from \ngetting green cards and would seal their bank accounts.  After another worker complained about \nthe working conditions, Signal personnel told Shukla and a group of workers that the \ncomplaining worker had been sent back to India. \n482.  On one occasion, Signal gave the workers three days off for Thanksgiving. \nShukla wanted to travel with several other workers to visit a friend in Houston, Texas.  To do so, \nSignal required the workers to write a letter explaining who they were going to see, where they \nwere going, how long they would be gone and the reason for going.  Signal approved the letter, \nbut instructed them never to ask to leave again, and told them their visas were not approved yet \n95 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 96 of 123\nand so they were at risk of being apprehended by immigration or the police.  They were told \nSignal would not help them if that happened. \n483.  In or about July 2007, Shukla suffered a debilitating back injury while \nreplaCing parts because of poor safety conditions at work.  Shukla feared he and his team would \nget in trouble if they did not finish the job, so he continued working with the injury.  Signal \npersonnel checked on Shukla the following day and a nurse prescribed pain medication.  Despite \nintense and persistent pain, Shukla returned to work four days later because he feared he would \nbe harmed or deported if he did not work. \n484.  In or about July 2008, Shukla suffered a severe burn.  Because Signal \ncrowded workers into small workspaces, a piece of hot metal fell from a worker above onto \nShukla's foot and burned through to the bone.  Shukla could not go to the nurse because he had \nnot completed his work and would lose a day's pay if he left at that time.  By the time he finished \nhis shift, the nurse was gone.  Shukla went to the nurse the following morning and the nurse \nrefused to send Shukla to the doctor despite his repeated requests.  Instead, the nurse prescribed \nsome cream for the wound.  While he recovered, Shukla was not given leave from work but was \nreassigned to clean the camp.  Despite the persistent pain, Shukla went back to work on the rig \nafter one week because he feared Signal would not keep its promise of obtaining a green card for \nhim if he did not work. \n485.  In or about December 2008, Signal fired Shukla.  Signal personnel said \nthis was because Signal had no more work for him. \nPlaintiffA  jith CheJlayyan Swarnamma \n486.  In or about January or February 2004, Swarnamma was working as a \nwelder in Saudi Arabia and was on vacation home to Trivandrum, India when he saw an \nadvertisement placed in a local newspaper.  The advertisement offered immediate openings for \n96 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 97 of 123\nwelders and the opportunity to move to the United States with green cards for Swarnamma and \nhis family.  The advertisement requested that anyone interested either make contact or appear for \ntesting in Kochi, India. \n487.  In or about the end of January or beginning of February 2004, \nSwamamma went to a hotel in Kochi for trade testing.  Sachin Dewan, Pol and Dewan's agent, \nSalimon, were all present at the meeting.  These three men promised Swarnamma an immediate \nand permanent job in California with NASSCO Corporation, as well as a green card.  While \nSwamamma enjoyed his job in Saudi Arabia, he decided to take the opportunity for a green card \nin the United States.  Sachin Dewan promised to complete the necessary paperwork and take care \nof all the processing for a fee of 650,000 rupees.  According to Sachin Dewan, the entire process \nwould take three to four months to complete.  It was emphasized that the candidates could bring \ntheir families with them to the United States. \n488.  Sachin Dewan explained that the payments were to be made in three \ninstallments.  The first installment was due immediately.  Some payments were to be made in \nIndian cash and others were to be converted from check to U.S. dollars. \n489.  Swarnamma paid the first installment in March 2004, to either Sachin \nDewan or his agent, Salimon.  To make the first payment, Swarnamma depleted his life savings. \n490.  After depleting his savings to make the first payment, Swarnamma \nborrowed money from banks and from friends to pay the second installment.  Swarnamma was \nasked to pay the second installment because his visa processing was progressing and he would be \nleaving for the United States in three to four months.  Swarnamma believes either Sachin Dewan \nor his agent, Salimon, were present when he made the payment, as well as an American, likely \neither Malvern Burnett or Pol. \n97 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 98 of 123\n491.  In or about mid-2005. Swarnamma resigned his job in Saudi Arabia at \nJ & M Associates's direction and returned to India because he was told he would be traveling to \nthe United States any day.  While waiting to travel, Swarnamma could not take another job in \nIndia because he expected he would need to leave at any time.  Had Swarnamma not resigned, he \ncould have continued working at his job in Saudi Arabia indefinitely and continued to receive \npromotions and comfortable living accommodations there. \n492.  Swarnamma remained in India without work for over a year without \nhearing anything about his immigration processing. \n493.  In or about September 2006, Swarnamma received notice of his interview \nat the U.S. consulate.  By this time, Swarnamma had taken out substantial debt, foregone other \nwork opportunities and waited for his U.S. opportunity to materialize.  He felt pressured by \nSachin Dewan and his agent, Salim on, to complete his payments.  Swarnamma also feared that \nasking for a refund would jeopardize the opportunity he had invested in because he had heard \nthat other applicants that requested refunds had been denied and had not been able to travel to the \nUnited States. \n494.  In or about early November 2006, Swarnamma met with Sachin Dewan \nand his agent, Salimon, prior to his interview at the consulate.  These men told Swarnamma to \ntell the consulate that he was seeking temporary rather than permanent visa status, and not to \nreveal the fee amount he had paid in connection with processing his visa.  At this meeting, the \nmen also told Swamamma he would be working for a company called Signal in Mississippi, \ninstead of working for NASSCO in California.  Swamamma surrendered his passport at the \nconsulate. \n98 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 99 of 123\n495.  A couple of weeks later, Swarnamma met with Sachin Dewan at his office \nin Mumbai.  Sachin Dewan and his agent, Salimon, had retained Swarnamma's passport and \ndemanded his final payment before they would return it.  To make the final payment, \nSwamamma borrowed additional money and used money from his wedding gifts.  Swarnamma \nmade the payment and received his passport. \n496.  In or about the end of November 2006, or early December 2006, \nSwarnamma flew to the United States.  Swarnamma traveled to the United States without a green \ncard but was under the impression that his green card was still being processed for him.  He \nnever doubted that J & M Associates would fulfill its promise to obtain his green card. \n497.  By July 2013, Swarnamma estimates that he had been able to payoff \napproximately two-thirds of the loans he took out to pay the 650,000 rupee fee.  He has paid a 20 \npercent interest rate on his loans and still retains approximately 280,000 rupees of debt. \nPJaintiffShibu Thankachan \n498.  In or about December 2004, while working as a pipe welder in Saudi \nArabia and home in India for the holidays, Thankachan saw an advertisement in a local Indian \nnewspaper, Malayala Manorama.  The advertisement said that Dewan Consultants was \nrecruiting welders and pipefitters to work for J & M Associates in the United States.  The \nadvertisement promised that successful candidates would receive a green card in the United \nStates.  Interested candidates were advised to attend a seminar hosted by Dewan Consultants. \n499.  In or about December 2004, Thankachan attended a recruitment seminar \nled by Sachin Dewan and Pol.  At the seminar, Sachin Dewan and Pol explained that J & M \nAssociates was seeking pipefitters and welders for two-year contracts and that workers would \nobtain green cards for themselves and their families.  Sachin Dewan and Pol stated that the \ncandidates would need to make three installment payments of approximately 155,000 rupees \n99 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 100 of 123\neach for processing their applications and green cards.  The installments were to be paid to \nSachin Dewan in cash and to Global Resources and Malvern Burnett by check.  The first \ninstallment would be due after the seminar, the second installment would be due after each \nworker received his work authorization, and the final installment would be due right before each \nworker left for the United States.  Thankachan was also infonned that he could bring his family \nfor an additional fee of $650 per person.  Sachin Dewan and Pol explained that the process \nwould take approximately eighteen to twenty-four months. \n500.  In or about February 2005, Thankachan made his first installment \npayment.  To afford this payment, Thankachan took out a bank mortgage on land that he owned \nand also took out a loan from a local loan shark at an interest rate of 5 percent per month. \n50 I.  In or about March 2006, Thankachan paid his second installment payment. \nTo afford this payment, Thankachan took out an additional loan from the same local loan shark, \nagain at an interest rate of 5 percent per month.  After Thankachan paid his second installment, \nhe called Dewan Consultants' offices several times to ask about the next step in the application \nprocess.  Eventually, Thankachan informed Dewan's agent, Salimon, that he wanted to resign \nfrom the recruitment process and receive a refund of the fees he had already paid.  Salimon \ninfonned him that he would not be able to receive a full refund, but might be able to receive a \npartial refund ifThankachan could locate another worker to take his place.  Thankachan did not \nwithdraw. \n502.  In or about September 2006, while Thankachan was working in Saudi \nArabia, Dewan's agent, Salimon, called him and asked him to return to India because his green \ncard was ready.  Thankachan resigned from his job in Saudi Arabia without notice, thus \nforfeiting $15,000 in seniority-based bonus payments from his employer.  When Thankachan \n\\00 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 101 of 123\nreturned to India, Salimon informed him that his green card was not in fact ready and that there \nwas no longer an opportunity to work for J & M Associates.  Instead, the available job \nopportunity was to work for Signal and receive an H-2B visa.  Thankachan was informed that the \nvisa would be extended and then eventually processed for a green card. \n503.  In or about November 2006, Dewan's agent, Salimon, informed \nThankachan that he would need to take a welding test.  Signal personnel were present at \nThankachan's trade test. \n504.  In or about November 2006, Thankachan was also told to interview with \nthe U.S. consulate in India.  Before the interview, Dewan's agent, Salimon, instructed \nThankachan not to say anything about his intention to remain permanently in the United States or \nabout the payments he had made for the visa opportunity.  After the interview, the consulate \nreturned the passport to Dewan Consultants' offices. \n505.  On or about December 4,2006, Dewan's agent, Salimon, called \nThankachan and told him that he would be leaving for the United States on December 7,2006. \nThankachan was told that he would need to fly to Dewan Consultants' offices in Mumbai, at his \nown expense, to pay the final installment, and receive his plane ticket.  Thankachan did so and \npaid the third installment.  To afford this payment, Thankachan took out an additional loan from \nthe same local loan shark at an interest rate of 5 percent per month and sold some of his family's \ngold. \n506.  In total, Thankachan paid approximately $13,260 to Sachin Dewan, \nGlobal Resources and Malvern Burnett, including related expenses such as testing fees, airfare, \nand immigration fees. \n101 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 102 of 123\n507.  At the Signal camp in Mississippi. Thankachan was not allowed to leave \nother than to go to work, go to Wal-Mart once a week and attend the Pentecostal church of one \nof the Signal personnel-- visits to other places of worship were not permitted. \n508.  When arriving at the camp because of the incidents on March 9, 2007, \nThankachan recalls that even the police said they were surprised by the harsh conditions at the \ncamp. \n509.  On or about March 24, 2007, Thankachan escaped the camp by climbing \nthe fence under the cover of night.  After he left, Signal punished him and others by freezing the \nbank accounts Signal had helped the workers open.  The accounts were only unfrozen after the \nworkers received assistance from a charity group. \nPlaintiffJ aison Antony Thekkumpuram \n510.  In or about February 2004, when he was working in Dubai, \nThekkumpuram saw an advertisement in a newspaper seeking fitters and welders for positions in \nthe United States.  As directed by the advertisement, Thekkumpuram contacted the office of \nDewan Consultants in Media City, Dubai.  Thekkumpuram registered his name for the \nopportunity and learned that there would be a meeting with Americans in attendance in March or \nApril 2004. \n51!.  In or about the end of March 2004, Thekkumpuram went to a meeting at a \nDubai hotel led by Sachin Dewan, Manesh Dewan, Varuna Dewan, Pol and Malvern Burnett. \nThese individuals represented J & M Associates.  They told candidates at the meeting that the \njob offered $14 per hour, plus a $6 per hour allowance per diem, free transportation, \naccommodation, and a guarantee of permanent resident status for candidates and their families \nwithin eighteen to twenty-four months.  After getting their green cards, candidates would be \nrequired to work for J & M Associates for two years.  Alternatively, after six months they could \n102 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 103 of 123\npay $5,000 to be released from the two-year contract so that they could work anywhere in the \nUnited States. \n512.  Thekkumpuram did not sign a contract in the first meeting because he was \nasked to pay a total of $14,000 and he was earning $550 per month in salary in Dubai at the time. \nThe $14,000 payment was to made in three installments, each split three ways between Dewan \nConsultants, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett.  Those leading the meeting promised to \nreturn candidates' money if they failed their interviews at the U.S. consulate. \n513.  In or about April 2004, Thekkumpuram attended a meeting organized by \nDewan Consultants at a Hilton Hotel in Kochi, India.  He sold his wife's gold jewelry for $1,500 \nand paid the amount to Sachin Dewan, but it was not enough to cover what Sachin Dewan \ndemanded.  Sachin Dewan told Thekkumpuram he had one week to pay the balance or he would \nremove Thekkumpuram's name from the list.  Thekkumpuram went back to Dubai and borrowed \n$3,000 with interest from a private money lender.  Thekkumpuram gave this sum to Sachin \nDewan in the presence of Varuna Dewan, but received a receipt for on Iy the portion of the \npayment that Sachin Dewan would keep, not the portions to be given to Global Resources and \nMalvern Burnett. \n514.  In or about the end of January 2006, Dewan's agent, Salimon, called \nThekkumpuram to say his labor certification was ready and ask for payment of the second \ninstallment.  To make the payment, Thekkumpuram used his savings and borrowed money from \nfriends and family.  Thekkumpuram paid $1,250 in cash to Sachin Dewan and did not receive a \nreceipt.  He paid $1,250 to each of Global Resources and Malvern Burnett by check. \n515.  When he paid the second installment, Thekkumpuram spoke to Sachin \nDewan and his agent, Salimon.  He told them that he did not have a job and could not pay the \n103 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 104 of 123\nthird installment.  They told Thekkumpuram he would need to pay the third installment within \nsix months when his visa was ready.  To earn the amount for the third installment, Sachin Dewan \nand Salimon sent Thekkumpuram to Saudi Arabia to work a low-paying job where he earned \n$300 a month for six months.  In exchange for this arrangement, Thekkumpuram had to pay an \nadditional $250, \n516.  After six months, Thekkumpuram heard that Sachin Dewan was sending \napplicants to the United States.  He contacted Dewan's agent, Salimon, and asked about the \nstatus of his green card.  Salimon said that his green card would involve more delay, and that if \nThekkumpuram preferred, he could go to the United States sooner on an H-28 visa for an \nadditional fee of$I,OOO, plus airfare.  The job in the United States would pay $18 per hour, and \nprovide free accommodations.  Thekkumpuram would pay only a little for food.  Salimon \nexplained that after Thekkumpuram's green card was approved, he could come back to India and \nthen return to the United States with permanent status. \n517.  To pay the final installment and these additional fees, Thekkumpuram had \nto sell his only property, a plot of land, for $4,000.  He also had to borrow $1,250 from his \nfather-in-law. \n518.  Dewan's agent, Salimon, contacted Thekkumpuram to direct him to come \nto Chennai to pay the fee and to appear for his U.S. consulate interview.  In or about the end of \nOctober 2006, Thekkumpuram reached Chennai by train and met Sachin Dewan, Salimon and \nSignal personnel.  These men said that Signal would obtain H-28 visas and then green cards for \nthe applicants.  They also instructed Thekkumpuram to tell the consulate, and sign a statement \nsaying, that he only paid $750 in connection with his visa.  They did not let Thekkumpuram have \na copy of this statement.  This made him very uncomfortable, but Thekkumpuram trusted Sachin \n104 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 105 of 123\nDewan because he was from his home state of Kerala.  Sachin Dewan then gave Thekkumpuram \na letter telling him to pay $1,460 to Global Resources and the same amount to Malvern Burnett \nafter he passed the trade test.  This letter also first notified Thekkumpuram that Signal would not \nprovide free accommodation, as originally promised. \n519.  At the consulate interview, the interviewer collected Thekkumpuram's \npassport. \n520.  Shortly after returning to Kerala, Thekkumpuram received a call from \nDewan's agent, Salimon, who said that his visa was approved.  Thekkumpuram had to prepare \nthe third installment and prepare to depart for the United States. \n521.  On or about December 6, 2006, Thekkumpuram went to Sachin Dewan's \noffice in Mumbai, which was an intimidating place because there were many \"thugs\" standing \naround the office, and Thekkumpuram heard Sachin Dewan yelling at people.  He handed his \nmoney directly to Sachin Dewan, who told him to sign some papers.  He did not get time to read \nwhat he was signing.  However, he noticed a document concerning his labor certification that \npermitted unrestricted transfer of the certificate. This document worried Thekkumpuram, and he \nasked about it.  Sachin Dewan repeated that Signal would process his green card.  Sachin Dewan \ngave him a copy of the letter from Signal offering permanent residence status.  Sachin Dewan \nhad possession of Thekkumpuram's passport and only returned it to him after he had paid and \nsigned and returned the paperwork. \n522.  After Thekkumpuram and others paid the third installment, Sachin Dewan \nshared more details about the job. Contrary to what Sachin Dewan and others had told the \napplicants at the earlier meeting, he said Signal would deduct $35 per day for room and board. \nPrior to this, the applicants had been told they would only have to pay a small amount for food. \n\\05 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 106 of 123\nThekkumpuram felt deceived, but because of the intimidating atmosphere of Sachin Dewan's \noffice, he knew that by this point, he lacked the option to back out and get his money back. \n523.  In total, Thekkumpuram paid over $15,250 to Sachin Dewan, Global \nResources and Malvern Burnett.  To finance such payments, Thekkumpuram sold many of his \nfamily's assets and borrowed large sums of money with high interest rates from lenders, family \nand friends. \n524.  On or about December 7, 2006, Thekkumpuram traveled to Mississippi. \nWhen he arrived, the camp looked like a refugee camp.  He often saw snakes near the door of his \nhousing unit.  There was also a wasp nest inside his housing unit, and he was stung by a yellow \njacket on his second day at the camp. \n525.  Thekkumpuram witnessed the incident on March 9, 2007 in which one \nworker cut his wrist when Signal personnel came to retrieve him.  Thekkumpuram saw that \nworker bleeding profusely and heard him crying, \"I have no other way, don't sent me back to \nIndia.\"  At the time, armed Signal personnel and some other workers were in the room. \nThekkumpuram feared the police would arrest him and the other workers after this incident. \n526.  In or about August 2007, Malvern Burnett filed his 1-140 application for \nhim based on his labor certification with J & M Associates.  Malvern Burnett refused to file his \n1-485 for him and directed him to another lawyer, Ram Cheerath, for a $500 transfer fee. \n527.  On or about November 30, 2007, Thekkumpuram escaped the Signal camp \nat midnight and got a ride from a friend to take a position with J & M Associates in Florida. \nThekkumpuram was so scared to be caught leaving Signal that he left his valuables behind. \nPlaintiffShajan Varghese \n528.  Plaintiff Shajan Varghese was recruited beginning in or about February \n2004 and arrived in the United States in or about December 2006. \n106 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 107 of 123\n529.  In or about February 2004, while he was working in Dubai, a friend of \nVarghese's told him about an advertisement for ajob opportunity in the United States.  Varghese \nwas interested in the opportunity because it would provide a higher salary, $18 per hour plus \novertime, and offered the opportunity to obtain a green card. \n530.  In or about late February 2004, Varghese attended a recruitment seminar \nin Dubai hosted by Sachin Dewan.  During this seminar, Sachin Dewan said that there were job \nopportunities for pipefitters in the United States with J & M Associates, that candidates would be \neligible for green cards and that it would take approximately eighteen months to obtain the \nnecessary labor certifications to work in the United States. \n531.  Varghese paid three installments of approximately 12,500 dirham each for \nthe opportunity to work in the United States. \n532.  On or about April 14, 2004, Varghese paid his first installment using \nmoney he had saved from his work in Dubai.  Varghese made the payment by giving three \nchecks for equal amounts to Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett.  Varghese \nwas told it would take about nine months for his papers to be ready and that he would make his \nsecond payment at that time. \n533.  On or about February 18,2006, Varghese paid the second installment.  In \norder to make the payment, he borrowed money from friends and took out a loan at a 9 percent \ninterest rate.  After paying the second installment, Varghese was told that Hurricane Katrina had \ncaused several delays and it would be approximately one more year before he woula receive \nfinal approval to work in the United States. \n534.  On or about August 2006, Varghese went on leave from his job in Dubai \nand returned to India.  Varghese contacted Dewan's agent, Salimon.  Salimon informed him that \n107 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 108 of 123\nworkers were now being processed for H-2B visas, instead of green cards, and he would be \nworking for Signal in the United States, instead of J & M Associates.  Salimon informed \nVarghese that the H-2B visa could be renewed and then automatically processed as a green card. \n535.  In or about November 2006, Varghese was asked to attend a training and \nseminar at a hotel in Chennai.  At the seminar, Varghese took and passed a written pipefitting \ntest.  Sachin Dewan also prepared the applicants for their interview with the U.S. consulate. \nDuring this interview preparation, Sachin Dewan instructed Varghese to tell the consulate that he \nwould only be working in the United States for six months and then would return to India.  He \nwas also instructed not to mention any of the payments he had made for the visa opportunity. \nAfter the interview at the consulate, Sachin Dewan told Varghese that he could expect to leave \nfor the United States within a few days. \n536.  In or about December 2006, Varghese was approved to travel to the \nUnited States.  At this time, he made his final installment payment of 150,000 rupees in cash to \nSachin Dewan and gave Sachin Dewan checks for Global Resources and Malvern Burnett.  To \nmake this payment, he took out a loan on property his father gave him.  Varghese paid the final \ninstallment and departed for the United States. \n537.  At the Signal camp in Mississippi, on or about February 19,2007, \nVarghese was told that Signal did not have any more work for him unless he worked for $10 per \nhour.  At this rate, Varghese knew he could never repay the debt he took out to pay the \nrecruitment fees.  Varghese decided to leave the camp. \nPlaintiff Thomas Varghese Vattakkattu \n538.  In early 2005, Vartakkattu saw an advertisement in a local Indian \nnewspaper, Malayala Manorama, for an opportunity for employment and permanent residency \n108 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 109 of 123\nin the United States for applicants and their families.  The advertisement referenced a seminar \nabout the opportunity, which Vattakkattu attended at the Triton Hi lton Hotel in Kochi, India. \n539.  In or about February 2005, Sachin Dewan, Dewan's agent, Salimon, \nMalvern Burnett and Pol were all present at the seminar.  They explained that the job would be \nin California, would pay $16 an hour, $21 an hour overtime, and would include a $60 per diem \nallowance for food and housing.  They also explained that the opportunity would include a green \ncard, which would take nine to twelve months to process.  The cost to the applicants was \n$14,500, plus $1,500 for each family member, and payment would be made in three installments, \neach split between Sachin Dewan, Global Resources and Malvern Burnett.  Vattakkattu paid the \nfirst installment at or about the time of the seminar. \n540.  Vattakkattu received his labor certification in early 2006.  In mid-2006, \nSachin Dewan informed him that the green card application process would take a long time \nbecause Malvern Burnett's office had been destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, including the \npaperwork ofVattakkattu and other applicants.  Sachin Dewan said, however, that there was a \nnew opportunity to work for Signal with an H-2B visa.  When asked about the promised green \ncard opportunity, Sachin Dewan stated that H-2B visas could be extended and, during the \nextension period, a green card application would be made.  Sachin Dewan also told Vattakkattu \nthat Malvern Burnett would ensure Vattakkattu's family could come to the United States. \nHaving already borrowed and paid money, and faced with the prospect of having nothing to \nshow for it, Vattakkattu had no choice but to move forward with Signal and an H-2B visa. \n541.  In mid-2006, Vattakkattu took and passed a welding and pipefitting test \nthat was administered in Chennai.  Sachin Dewan and Signal personnel were present at the test. \nVattakkattu then paid the second installment. \n109 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 110 of 123\n542.  At or about the end of October 2006, Vattakkattu was interviewed by the \nU.S. consulate.  Prior to the interview, Vattakkattu attended a meeting with Sachin Dewan and \nMalvern Burnett in which he was instructed on how to handle the interview.  These instructions \nincluded being warned not to mention money he had paid for the visa opportunity and, ifhe did, \nhe and the other applicants would be denied visas. \n543.  Although the consulate told Vattakkattu that he would receive his passport \nby mail, Sachin Dewan stated later that Vattakkattu would receive his passport from Dewan \nConsultants.  Vattakkattu had to travel to Dewan Consultants' Mumbai offices to get his passport \nback.  Before returning Vattakkattu's passport, Sachin Dewan insisted that Vattakkattu sign \npapers without being given an opportunity to read or understand them.  Sachin Dewan took those \npapers and other papers and receipts that he had provided to Vattakkattu earlier in the process. \n544.  In total, Vattakkattu paid approximately $17,500 dollars to pursue this \nopportunity for himself, his wife and his daughter.  He raised money by selling his wife's jewelry \nand taking out loans from moneylenders at exorbitant interest rates.  Today, Vattakkattu is still \nrepaying moneylenders what he borrowed. \n545.  At the Signal camp in Mississippi, Vattakkattu's housing unit was initially \nvery cold.  Then Signal turned the heat on high, which blew directly on Vattakkattu's bed. \nSignal did nothing in response to Vattakkattu's complaints about the heater and he had no other \nplace to which he could escape. \n546.  Vattakkattu worked as a pipefitter for Signal and was forced to work, cut \nand weld under dangerous conditions, including in confined places with crude oil, where a small \nmistake could have resulted in a dangerous fire.  Signal personnel consistently harassed \nVattakkattu and his Indian colleagues, including referring to them as \"motherfucker\" when \n110 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 111 of 123\ndirecting their work.  Vattakkattu's non-Indian colleagues were not subjected to this same \ntreatment. \n547.  Vattakkattu was unable to visit with family because of Signal's policy \nagainst allowing him to have guests at the camp.  At Christmas, Vattakkattu's brother traveled to \nthe camp to visit, but Signal personnel would not permit him to enter the camp, nor did they \ninform Vattakkattu that his brother was waiting at the gate.  After hours had passed, one of \nVattakkattu's friends was coming in after work, spoke to Vattakkattu's brother, and informed \nVattakkattu of the situation.  When he went out, the Signal personnel would not let Vattakkattu \nleave with his brother.  As a result, the two were limited to a visit, outside, of about thirty \nminutes. \n548.  In or about April 2007, Sachin Dewan called Vattakkattu's home and \noffered tickets for Vattakkattu and all of his family to travel to Mumbai if Vattakkattu would tell \na judge, via videoconference, that all of the conditions at Signal were good.  Vattakkattu refused \nto do so. \n549.  When Vattakkattu prepared to leave the camp for another opportunity in \nNovember 2007, Malvern Burnett charged him $500 to release the files necessary to pursue this \nother opportunity. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nForced Labor (18 U.S.C ยง 1589) And Trafflcking With Respect To Peonage, Slavery, \nInvoluntary Servitude, Or Forced Labor (18 U.S.C ยง 1590) \n550.

Defendants Signal, Dewan, Burnett, and Global Resources attempted to \nand did subject each Plaintiff to forced labor in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589. \n554.  Defendant Signal employed Plaintiffs in dangerous conditions at a \nguarded and gated camp, and all Defendants falsely assured Plaintiffs that if they continued to \nwork, Signal would assist them in applying for and receiving green cards.  Defendants controlled \nPlaintiffs' housing, food, access to medical care and other basic needs, and if Plaintiffs did not \ncontinue working for Signal, they would have been cut off from those needs. \n555.  Furthermore, the substantial \"recruitment fees\" that Defendants coerced \nPlaintiffs into paying forced Plaintiffs to work at Signal to payoff their substantial debts. \n556.

Defendants' scheme to isolate Plaintiffs, coerce them to live in conditions \ncausing psychological harm and limit their outside contacts, which included unlawful \ndiscrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981, was designed to convince Plaintiffs that they \nwould suffer serious harm if they were to leave the employ of Signal. \n559.  Defendants threatened not to extend Plaintiffs' H-2B visas, not to sponsor \nPlaintiffs for green cards, to deport Plaintiffs and to send them back to India if they complained \nabout conditions at Signal, and also deceived Plaintiffs about the terms of their immigration \n112 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 113 of 123\nstatus, each in a manner that constitutes an abuse ofthe legal process under 18 U.S.c. ยง 1589(3). \nDefendants retaliated against Plaintiffs when they sought legal advice regarding their rights and \nimmigration status. \n560.

Plaintiffs \nare entitled to recover compensatory and punitive damages in an amount to be proven at trial, \nincluding recruitment fees, other payments made to Signal agents and attorneys' fees. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolations 0/42 U.S.c. ยง 1981 \n564.  Each Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every \nallegation contained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n565.  Each Plaintiff asserts this claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981 for \ndeclaratory relief and damages against Defendant Signal. \n566.  The actions of Defendant Signal, as set forth herein, violated Plaintiffs' \nrights to make and enforce contracts and to receive the full and equal benefit of all laws as \nguaranteed by 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981, including Plaintiffs' rights to enjoy and benefit from non-\ndiscriminatory employment relationships with Defendant Signal. \n567.  Specifically, Defendant Signal subjected Plaintiffs to discriminatory and \noffensive mandatory room and board arrangements at Signal camps in Pascagoula.  Defendant \nSignal did not subject its employees of non-Indian race, ethnicity or alienage to the same or \nsimilar room and board arrangements. \n568..  As set forth in the preceding paragraphs, Defendant Signal also imposed \non Plaintiffs discriminatory job-related requirements and adverse terms and conditions of \nemployment to which its employees of non-Indian race, ethnicity or alienage were not similarly \nsubjected. \n569.  As set forth in the preceding paragraphs, Defendant Signal also created \nand fostered a discriminatory work environment in which Indian workers were subjected to anti-\n114 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 115 of 123\nIndian invective throughout the time Plaintiffs were employed.  Signal employees of non-Indian \nrace, ethnicity or alienage were not subjected to a similar work environment. \n570.  As set forth in the preceding paragraphs, through the actions and \nstatements of its personnel referring to and/or directed at Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B \nworkers, Defendant Signal maintained an objectively hostile and abusive work environment on \naccount of Plaintiffs' race, ethnicity, religion and alienage throughout the time Plaintiffs were \nemployed. \n571.  As set forth in the preceding paragraphs, Defendant Signal's \ndiscriminatory and offensive treatment of Plaintiffs was sufficiently severe that it created a \nhostile work environment in violation of 42 U .S.c. ยง 1981 throughout the time Plaintiffs were \nemployed. \n572.  Plaintiffs reasonably perceived their work environment to be hostile, \nabusive and discriminatory on the basis of their race, ethnicity, religion and alienage. \n573.  Defendant Signal's hostile, abusive and discriminatory treatment of \nPlaintiffs and other class members was unwelcome. \n574.  Defendant Signal knowingly, willfully, maliciously, intentionally and \nwithout justification acted to deprive Plaintiffs oftheir rights. \n575.  Defendants' actions evince malice and/or reckless indifference towards \nPlaintiffs. \n576.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' knowing, willing and \nintentional actions, each Plaintiff has been injured and is entitled to recover compensatory and \npunitive damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including attorneys' fees. \n115 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 116 of 123\nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFraudulent Misrepresentation \n577.  Each Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every \nallegation contained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n578.  Each Plaintiff brings this claim against all Defendants. \n579.  The actions of Defendants, as set forth herein, constitute fraudulent \nmisrepresentation under Mississippi law. \n580.  Specifically, Defendants, individually and through their agents, employees \nand/or representatives, knowingly made material and false representations and omissions of fact \nto Plaintiffs regarding the nature, terms and conditions of applications and opportunities for \nimmigration status and employment in the United States. \n581.  Defendants and/or their respective agents represented to each Plaintiff that \n(1) Plaintiffs would be eligible for permanent residency given their employment with Signal; (2) \nDefendants would apply for permanent residency in the United States on behalf of Plaintiffs no \nlater than twenty-four months after the commencement of work; (3) no additional fees would be \nrequired to secure Plaintiffs' permanent residence in the United States; and (4) Plaintiffs would \nhave steady and ongoing work opportunities in the United States with Defendant Signal. \n582.  At the time each of these representations were made, Defendants knew \nthey were false or misleading. \n583.  Defendants intended that the false statements made by each Defendant \nand/or Defendants' respective agents, employees and/or representatives would induce Plaintiffs \nto pay the exorbitant \"recruitment fees,\" would induce Plaintiffs to leave their homes and jobs \nabroad, travel to the United States and work for Signal, and would induce Plaintiffs to pay the \n116 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 117 of 123\nroom and board fee and other fees extracted by Signal upon the workers' arrival in the United \nStates. \n584.  Each Plaintiff was entitled to, and did, rely on Defendants' representations. \n585.  In reasonable reliance on the false representations of Defendants and their \nrespective agents, employees and/or representatives regarding green cards, employment \nopportunities and employment conditions, Plaintiffs paid large sums of money and incurred \nsubstantial debt in the guise of \"recruitment fees\" and other travel- and immigration-related fees. \nSignal knew of these payments and permitted them to be made to its agents. \n586.  In reasonable reliance on the false representations of Defendants and their \nrespective agents, employees and/or representatives regarding green cards, employment \nopportunities and employment conditions, Plaintiffs surrendered employment opportunities in \nIndia and abroad, left their homes and families behind, sold personal and real property, secured \nloans at usurious interest rates, traveled to the United States and worked for Signal.  Furtber, \nonce in the United States, Plaintiffs continued to work for Signal after receiving repeated \nassurances that Defendants' prior representations were in fact true. \n587.  No later than the first day that Indian workers arrived at Signal, \nDefendants knew that Plaintiffs and their coworkers believed that Defendants had applied, or \nwere intending to apply, for permanent residency on behalf of Plaintiffs.  Defendants therefore \nhad an obligation to tell Plaintiffs that this was not true.  Defendants failed to do so. \n588.  Defendants' actions evince malice and/or reckless indifference towards \nPlaintiffs. \n117 \n\n'II \nCase 2:13-cv-06219-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 118 of 123\n589.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' knowing, willing and \nintentional actions, each Plaintiff has been injured and is entitled to recover compensatory \ndamages, including opportunity costs, and punitive damages in an amount to be proven at trial. \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nNegligent Misrepresentation \n590.

Each Plaintiff accepted Defendants' offers and promises; each Plaintiff \npaid the agreed-upon fees and performed the agreed-upon work. \n609.
