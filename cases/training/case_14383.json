It was consolidated with <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14380\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Achari v. Signal International</em></a> and continues on that page.</p>\r\n<p>On Aug. 7, 2013, two Indian guestworkers filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi for harm suffered as a result of an allegedly fraudulent and coercive employment recruitment scheme. Plaintiffs filed this suit after District Judge Jay Zainey <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-LA-0010-0016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">denied class certification</a> on Jan. 3, 2012 in a related case, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14377\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>David v. Signal International</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs were allegedly brought into the United States to provide labor and services to defendant Signal International, a company based in Pascagoula, Mississippi with operations in the Gulf Coast region, in the business of providing repairs to offshore oil rigs. The complaint alleged that plaintiffs paid Signal's recruiters approximately $15,000 for recruitment fees, as well as additional fees for skills and medical tests. The plaintiffs also named Malvern C. Burnett and Sachin Dewan, a New Orleans lawyer and India-based recruiter, respectively, as co-defendants for their involvement in the scheme. Upon arrival in the United States, plaintiffs discovered that they would not receive the green cards promised to them. Instead, they were forced to pay additional fees ($1050 per month) to live in racially segregated labor camps under constant supervision of private security guards, and were subject to threats of both legal and physical harm if they complained about the conditions or decided not to provide labor.</p>\r\n<p>The complaint alleged violations of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (18 U.S.C. &sect;1589 (forced labor) and 18 U.S.C. &sect;1590 (trafficking)), Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (18 U.S.C. &sect;1962(c) and (d)), Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. &sect;1981), Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. &sect;1985), the Thirteenth Amendment, as well as claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of confidential relationship. Plaintiffs were represented by private law firms.</p>\r\n<p>In Oct. 2013, the Court (Chief U.S. District Judge Louis Guirola, Jr.) transferred this case and <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14380\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Achari</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14381\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Chakkiyattil v.

The Court disagrees for multiple reasons. \nover certain claims.3 Signal argues the 2008 amendment is    \nnot  retroactive.  Accordingly,  Plaintiffs’  claims  are  *2 First, Signal’s argument belies the plain language of \ngoverned by the pre-amendment version of the TVPA,  the statute. That the pre-amendment version distinguished \nwhich Signal argues is restricted to “purely domestic”  between “serious harm” and “physical restraint” suggests \ntrafficking claims. Signal contends Plaintiffs’ claims are  “Congress intended that serious harm not be limited to \nextraterritorial, because they rely extensively on events  physical  harm,  and  instead  include  at  least  some \nthat  occurred  outside  the  United  States.  Accordingly,  non-physical  harm,  e.g.,  financial  harm.”12  Moreover, \nSignal argues the claims are not cognizable as a matter of  “[s]tandard definitions of ‘harm’ do not restrict the term \nlaw.  to physical harm, but also encompass economic injury.”13 \n   Second, the legislative history suggests Congress intended \nThe Court need not decide whether the amendment to the  pre-amendment Section 1589 to cover a “broad array of \nTVPA was retroactive, because Plaintiffs’ claims are not  harms,” such as causing the victim to believe he or she \nextraterritorial. As one court has observed: “the TVPA is  would face “bankruptcy in their home country.”14 Third, at \nnot applied extraterritorially when it addresses trafficking  least two courts have squarely held that “financial harm \npeople into the United States to perform forced labor here,  was cognizable as serious harm prior to the December 23, \neven if done by means of threats of serious harm in part  2008 amendment.”15 This Court joins their lead and holds \nmade elsewhere.”4 Moreover, courts regularly entertain  that  serious  harm  under  pre-amendment  Section  1589 \nsuits under the pre-amendment TPVA alleging trafficking  includes financial harm. \ninto the United States from a foreign country.5    \n    \nAlthough  certain  elements  of  the  alleged  trafficking   \nscheme occurred abroad, “the focus and the touchstone of \nthe territoriality inquiry of the TVPA is where the forced \nlabor occurred and to where the victims were trafficked,  III. Scienter \nand  not  from  where  the  victims  were  trafficked  or  In order to prevail under pre-amendment Section 1589, a \nwhether some of the means used to compel the labor  plaintiff must prove the defendant knowingly provided or \noccurred abroad.”6 It is undisputed that Plaintiffs were  obtained labor in one of three ways: \ntrafficked from India to the United States and performed \n(1) by threats of serious harm to, or physical restraint \nlabor for Signal while in the United States. \nagainst, that person or another person; \n  \nThese facts distinguish this case from others in which \n(2) by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern intended \ncourts have dismissed pre-amendment TVPA claims as \nto cause the person to believe that, if the person did not \nextraterritorial.  In  those  cases,  the  alleged  trafficking \nperform such labor or services, that person or another \noccurred  outside  the  United  States.7  For  example,  in \nperson would suffer serious harm or physical restraint; \nAdhikari v. Daoud & Partners—cited heavily in Signal’s \nor \nbrief—the plaintiffs alleged a scheme to traffic workers \n(3) by means of the abuse or threatened abuse of law or \nfrom Nepal to Iraq.8 \nthe legal process [.]16 \n  \n  \n \nSignal  argues  there  is  no  evidence  it  acted  with  the \n \nrequisite  intent.  The  Court  disagrees.  Plaintiffs  have \nintroduced evidence from which a jury could infer Signal \nknowingly threatened immigration consequences in order \nII. Financial Harm as “Serious Harm ” \nThe pre-amendment version of Section 1589 of the TVPA  to  maintain  its  labor  force.17  Plaintiffs  have  also \nproscribed the knowing provision of labor by “threats of  introduced evidence tending to establish Signal was aware \nserious harm to, or physical restraint against, [the victim].9  its  workers  had  limited  financial  resources  and \nThe new version of Section 1589 reads similarly and  intentionally leveraged this situation to its advantage.18 \nprohibits the knowing provision of labor by “means of  Accordingly, there are genuine issues of material fact, \nserious harm or threats of serious harm to [the victim].”10  which preclude the entry of summary judgment. \nUnlike  pre-amendment  Section  1589,  the  new  version    \ncontains  a  broad  definition  of  “serious  harm,”  which  For the reasons previously stated; \nincludes “financial” harm.11 Signal argues the addition of    \nthis definition demonstrates that  “serious harm” under  IT IS ORDERED that the Motion is DENIED in its \n  2 \n \n\n \nentirety.

To the extent that a Party to whom documents are produced \n(“Receiving Party”) believes that “CONFIDENTIAL” documents and information should be \nproduced, disclosed or shown to an individual and/or entity not provided for in this paragraph, the \nReceiving Party shall first notify the Producing Party.  If the Producing Party objects to such \nproduction, disclosure, or showing, it shall notify the Receiving Party within five (5) business days \nof receiving notice, at which time the Receiving Party may file a motion with the Court.  No \nproduction, disclosure or showing shall be made prior to the time the motion is ruled upon by the \nCourt.

The method of advising the person may vary according to the \ncircumstances but, as soon as practicable (if practicable), the Party shall present the person with a \ncopy of this Protective Order and shall attempt to obtain the person’s signature on a complete copy \nof the Protective Order. \n5.   Any “CONFIDENTIAL” documents and information filed with the Court shall be \nfiled in sealed envelopes or other sealed containers (or in other sealed manners as designated and \napproved by the Court) that shall bear the caption of this action, an indication of the nature of the \ncontents of such envelope or container, a notation marked “CONFIDENTIAL,” and a statement \nsubstantially stating that the envelope or container is not to be opened, nor the contents thereof to \nbe displayed or revealed, except by express order of the Court. \n6.   Inadvertent or unintentional production of material which is not designated \n“CONFIDENTIAL” shall not be deemed a waiver in whole or in part of a claim for confidential \ntreatment.  The Producing Party may notify the Receiving Party that documents and information \nthat should have been designated as “CONFIDENTIAL” under the terms of this Order were \ninadvertently produced without being designated as such.  Upon receiving such notice from the \nProducing Party, the Receiving Party shall immediately treat the documents and information as if \nit had been so designated.  The Producing Party shall, within two (2) business days of providing \nsuch notice, produce to the Receiving Party copies of the relevant documents and information \n7 \n \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 183   Filed 02/17/14   Page 8 of 11\n \nwhich are appropriately marked as “CONFIDENTIAL.”  The Receiving Party shall thereafter \nmake reasonable efforts to delete and/or destroy the incorrectly designated material and all copies \nthereof.  No Party shall be held in violation of this Order if, before receipt of such notice, any \ndocuments and information inadvertently produced without being designated “CONFIDENTIAL” \nwere disclosed to any person(s) not authorized to receive “CONFIDENTIAL” documents and \ninformation under this Order. \n7.   If the Receiving Party believes that any documents and information improperly \nhave been designated “CONFIDENTIAL” and seeks to challenge the designation, it shall notify \nthe Producing Party in writing of its objections and bases.  The Producing Party and the Receiving \nParty shall work together to resolve any disputes as to “CONFIDENTIAL” documents and \ninformation prior to seeking assistance from the Court.  Within five (5) business days of receipt of \nthe written notice, the Producing Party shall seek a protective Order from the Court, or notify the \nReceiving Party, in writing, of its intent not to seek a protective order.  The Receiving Party shall \nnot disclose or disseminate the documents and information until expiration of the five (5) business \ndays referenced above, receipt of notice of the Producing Party’s intent not to seek a protective \norder, or on the Producing Party’s filing of a motion with the Court, whichever occurs first.  In the \nevent the Producing Party files a motion, the Receiving Party will treat the documents and \ninformation as “CONFIDENTIAL” (pursuant to the terms of this Protective Order) until the Court \nrules upon the Producing Party’s motion.  The Party seeking a protective order from the Court \nshall attach a copy of this Protective Order, and all written communications associated with efforts \nto resolve the dispute, as an exhibit to its Court filing. \n8.   Documents produced in the Consolidated Actions prior to the entry of this Order \nthat have been marked “CONFIDENTIAL” shall be treated as “CONFIDENTIAL,” subject to all \n8 \n \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 183   Filed 02/17/14   Page 9 of 11\n \nof the aforementioned provisions of this Order (including the right to challenge the confidentiality \ndesignation). \n9.  Nothing in this Order shall be construed to prevent a Party from waiving its own \nconfidentiality designation(s) at any time. \n10.   If a Party objects on confidentiality grounds to documents and information sought \npursuant to a subpoena, it shall notify the Party serving the subpoena that it believes that the \ndocuments and information are confidential, and the Party serving the subpoena shall agree to \nhandle and maintain the documents and information consistent with the terms of this Protective \nOrder.  If the Party serving the subpoena, after receipt of the documents and information, does not \nbelieve the documents should be designated “CONFIDENTIAL,” it shall notify the objecting \nParty within ten (10) days after receipt of the documents and information, and the parties thereafter \nshall follow the process contained in this Protective Order to resolve the issue. \n11.   During a deposition, a Party which seeks (for the first time) to have documents and \ntestimony treated as confidential shall make its request known on the record, triggering the \nobligations contained in this Protective Order.   \n12.  To the extent that material designated as “CONFIDENTIAL” is used in \ndepositions, such documents or information shall remain subject to the provisions of this Order, \nalong with the transcript pages of the deposition testimony referring to the “CONFIDENTIAL” \nmaterial. \n13.  Subject to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and any other applicable rules, \n“CONFIDENTIAL” material may be offered in evidence at trial or other court proceeding, \nprovided that the proponent of the evidence gives notice to counsel for the Party or other person \nthat made the “CONFIDENTIAL” material designation, sufficiently in advance so as to enable \n9 \n \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 183   Filed 02/17/14   Page 10 of 11\n \nany Party, either in writing or in open court, to move the Court for an order that the evidence be \nreceived in camera or under other conditions to prevent unnecessary disclosures.  The Court will \nthen determine whether the proffered evidence should continue to be treated as \n“CONFIDENTIAL” material and, if so, what protection, if any, may be afforded to such \ninformation at the trial or other court proceeding. \n14.   If any party files with the Court any medical and mental health records and/or files \nas described in paragraph 6(d), supra, or if any party files with the Court any reference to, \ndescription of, summary of, or excerpt from any such records or files (collectively “medical \nrecords and filings”), the Clerk shall keep such medical records and filings under seal and shall \nmake it available only to the Court and persons authorized by the terms of this Protective Order to \nhave access thereto.  The person filing any such medical records and filings shall be responsible for \ndesignating to the Clerk that the information is subject to this Protective Order and is to be kept \nunder seal.  At the conclusion of the Consolidated Actions, including any appeals, such records \nand filings which have been filed with the Court under seal shall be returned, upon reasonable \nrequest, to the Party which designated it as “CONFIDENTIAL.” \n15.   Any Producing Party may redact the first five digits of social security numbers (i.e., \n“xxx-xx-1234”) appearing in documents produced by that Party. \n16.  At the conclusion of these litigations, including any appeals, Receiving Parties \nshall destroy any documents or information produced to them in discovery and designated \n“CONFIDENTIAL” pursuant to this Order, except insofar as preservation and disclosure is \nmandated by court order. \nC.   Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall govern the production of \nelectronically stored information (“ESI”) in the Consolidated Actions.  The parties may request \n10 \n \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 183   Filed 02/17/14   Page 11 of 11\n \nESI from any other party in any format or form allowed under the Rules.  The protective orders \nentered in David, et al. v. Signal Int’l, LLC, et al. (No. 08-1220) (David Doc. #1352) or EEOC v. \nSignal Int’l, LLC, et al. (No. 12-557) (EEOC Doc. #285) shall have no application to the \nConsolidated Actions. \nD.   Use of the material gleaned through the pre-trial discovery process should be \nlimited to the preparation for and use at trial and for no other purpose until this dispute is resolved, \nthrough trial or settlement. \nE.   All home addresses and telephone numbers of former Signal employees and/or \nwitnesses disclosed either in discovery or Initial Disclosures shall be produced to counsel and: (1) \nonly counsel for the Parties and persons deemed, in good faith, by counsel to be necessary to \nprosecution of these litigations shall be privy to this information; (2) this information will not be \ndisseminated to any of the Parties; (3) counsel may use these addresses only in connection with \nprosecution of the Consolidated Actions; and (4) in the event any document containing this \ninformation is entered into the public record, the home addresses and telephone numbers for these \nindividuals will be fully redacted. \nF.   Counsel for the Parties are not required to serve a subpoena on any non-party \nshould counsel wish to speak to such a non-party. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED \nSigned in New Orleans, Louisiana, this 1_7_th day of February, 2014 \n \n  ____________________________________ \n  HON.

Signal (13-6218) \n \n   \nORDER \n  This  matter  was  initially  filed  in  the  Southern  District  of  Mississippi  and \ntransferred to the Eastern District of Louisiana under the \"first-to file\" rule.1  Signal has \nmoved for summary judgment on choice of law.2  The threshold issue is whether the \nchoice-of-law analysis is governed by Mississippi law or instead by the law of Louisiana.  \nAfter resolving this issue, the Court must engage in a substantive conflicts analysis to \ndetermine the law applicable to Plaintiffs' common law claims. \nI.  Whose Law Governs the Choice-of-Law Analysis?  \n  A federal court exercising supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims applies \nthe forum state's choice-of-law rules.3  The Supreme Court has held that when a case is \ntransferred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a),4 the transferee court must apply the choice-\nof-law rules that prevailed in the transferor court.5  Plaintiffs contend the so-called \"Van \nDusen rule\" applies in this case and that therefore Mississippi's choice-of-law principles \ncontrol.  Plaintiffs offer two arguments in support. \n                                                             \n1 See generally Achari v. Signal Int'l, LLC, Nos. 1:13CV222–LG–JMR, 1:13CV318–LG–JMR, 1:13CV319–\nLG–JMR, 2013 WL 5705660 (S.D. Miss. Oct. 18, 2013). \n2 R. Doc. 333. \n3 See Janvey v. Brown, 767 F.3d 430, 434 n.10 (5th Cir. 2014) \n4 This statue permits change of venue \"[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses,\" and \"in the interest \nof justice.\"  28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). \n5 See generally Ferens v. John Deere Co., 494 U.S. 516 (1990). \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 534   Filed 06/04/15   Page 3 of 5\n  First, they argue a transfer order under the first-to-file rule is effectuated through \nSection 1404(a) as a matter of law.6  The Court disagrees.  Plaintiff has not identified any \nFifth Circuit precedent to support this novel argument,7 nor has the Court found any.  \nThe first-to-file rule is a distinct procedural mechanism for transferring venue.8  For this \nreason, district courts in the Fifth Circuit routinely distinguish between transfers under \nSection 1404(a) and transfers under the first-to-file rule.9   \n  Second, even if this case was transferred under the first-to-file rule, Plaintiffs \nargue the \"logic and holdings of both Van Dusen and Ferens\" should still apply.10  The \nFifth Circuit has not yet addressed this issue.11  As far as this Court can tell, only four \ncourts have addressed whether the Van Dusen rule applies to first-to-file transfers.  One \ncourt has squarely held it does not.12  The other three—while not directly answering the \nquestion—expressed skepticism that Van Dusen applies to transfers under the first-to-\nfile rule.13  The Court finds the reasoning in these cases persuasive.  Furthermore, \n                                                             \n6 See R. Doc. 347, p. 12. \n7 Plaintiffs cite one district court decision from Delaware in support. \n8 See White v. Peco Foods, Inc., 546 F. Supp. 2d 339, 343 (S.D. Miss. 2008) (\"As other district courts have \npointed out, a motion to transfer pursuant to the first-to-file rule does not depend on the presence or \nabsence of the § 1404(a) considerations.\"). \n9 See, e.g., Partners, L.P. v. Land Am. Am. Title Co., No. 3-08-CV-1547-O, 2008 WL 5119599, at *4 (N.D. \nTex. Dec. 3, 2008) (\"Even if the court does not follow the 'first-to-file' rule, transfer is warranted under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1404(a).\"); Strukmyer, LLC v. Infinite Fin.

Co, Inc., 386 F.3d 581, 600 (4th Cir. 2004) \n(\"Under these circumstances, and in light of the principles animating the Supreme Court's decision in Van \nDusen, we are not at all sure that the Van Dusen precedent should be blindly and mechanically applied, as \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 534   Filed 06/04/15   Page 4 of 5\nbecause the policy justifications underlying Section 1404(a) and the first-to-file rule are \noften in tension,14 it makes little sense to apply the Van Dusen rule—a rule developed to \ngovern Section 1404(a) transfers—to a first-t0-file transfer.  Because the Court finds the \nVan  Dusen  rule  inapplicable  in  this  case,  Louisiana  law  governs  the  choice-of-law \nanalysis. \nII.  Choice-of-Law Analysis \n  The Court has already engaged in a similar Louisiana conflicts analysis in the \nDavid case.15  Because the operative facts and causes of action in David are substantially \nsimilar to the instant case,16 the David opinion guides the Court's analysis.  In David, \nthe  Court  held  that  the  law  of  India  governs  the  claims  for  fraud  and  negligent \nmisrepresentation and that Mississippi law governs the claims for breach of contract \nand agency.  There is no reason to deviate from this analysis. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nthe [plaintiffs] would have us do.\"); Chartis, 930 F.

None of the Defendants are employees, officers, or directors of Enterprise II. \nD.  Enterprise II is an \"association in fact\" enterprise.

The Defendants are individuals or entities separate from Enterprise II. \nF.  None of the Defendants are the enterprise itself. \nIII.  Enterprise III \nA.  Individuals and  Entities Constituting the Entemrise: The Recruiter Defendants, the \nLegal Facilitator Defendants, Defendant Signal, Swetman Security, and M&M Bank. \nB. Structure, Purpose, Roles, Function, and Course of Conduct of the Entemrise: \nII \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 2   Filed 08/07/13   Page 12 of 18\nThis  infonnation is provided  in  the  Complaint at '\\['\\[  247-251,  which is  incorporated \nherein by reference.  Enterprise III is an association in fact  between and among the Recruiter \nDefendants, the Legal Facilitator Defendants, Defendant Signal, Swetman Security, and M & M \nBank. The Legal Facilitator Defendants, the Recruiter Defendants, and Defendant Signal worked \nin concert with the common purpose of providing and maintaining a consistent and acquiescent \nIndian worker labor force at Signal's operations. Swetman Security provided security services in \nsupport of Enterprise III. M & M Bank provided financial services in support of Enterprise III. \nC.  None of the Defendants are employees, officers, or directors of Enterprise III. \nD.  Enterprise III is an \"association in fact\" enterprise. As set forth in subsection (ii), \nsupra,  the Recruiter Defendants, the  Legal  Facilitator Defendants, and  Defendant Signal are \nassociated with Enterprise III. \nE.  The Defendants are individuals or entities separate from Enterprise III. \nF.  None of the Defendants are the enterprise itself. \n7.  Separate Nature of the Enterprise and Racketeering Activity \nI.  Enterprise I \nThe  participants  in  this  enterprise  worked  in  concert  with  the  common  purpose  of \nsecuring the labor of Plaintiffs and other foreign workers at Defendant Signal's operations. As \nsuch, the enterprise as a whole has a common link other than the racketeering activity. \nII.  Enterprise II \nThe participants in this enterprise worked in concert with the common purpose of selling \nUnited States visas and work opportunities to Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, to convince \nthese workers to pay fees and to travel to the United States to work for companies including \nSignal. While the purpose of Enterprise II may violate other statutory protections, its common \nlink - the for-profit  business of selling United  States visa and work opportunities to  Indian \ncitizens - is distinguishable from the racketeering activity conducted through this enterprise. \nIII.  Enterprise III \nThe  participants  in  this  enterprise  worked  in  concert  with  the  common  purpose  of \nproviding and maintaining a consistent and acquiescent Indian worker labor force at Signal's \noperations.  The  enterprise's common link - the maintenance of a workforce for  Signal - is \ndistinguishable from the racketeering activity conducted through this enterprise. \n8.  Relationship  Between  the  Activities  of  the  Enterprise  and  the  Pattern  of \nRacketeering \nI.  Enterprise I \n12 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 2   Filed 08/07/13   Page 13 of 18\nThe Defendants used the mails and wires to defraud Plaintiffs, and committed visa fraud, \nfor the otherwise non-racketeering purpose of securing a workforce for Defendant Signal. The \nDefendants engaged in both fraudulent and non-racketeering activities to further this purpose. \nSimilarly,  the  Recruiter  Defendants,  the  Legal  Facilitator  Defendants,  and  Signal,  in  their \nongoing  relationship  with  Plaintiff,  other  foreign  workers,  and  Enterprise  I  as  a  whole, \ncommitted and/or conspired to commit acts constituting the involuntary servitude, forced labor, \nand human trafficking-related offenses.  However, not every act Defendants committed in the \ncontext of these relationships constituted an element of these crimes. Therefore, the \"usual and \ndaily activities\" of this enterprise were peppered with racketeering activities, but did not solely \ninvolve racketeering activities. \nII.  Enterprise II \nThe  Defendant  participants  in  this  enterprise  used  the  mails  and  wires  to  defraud \nPlaintiffs  and  other  workers,  and  committed  visa  fraud,  for  the  otherwise  non-racketeering \npurpose of selling United States visas and work opportunities to  Indian workers to convince \nthese workers to pay fees  and to travel to the  United States to work for companies including \nSignal.  These Defendants, through the  enterprise,  engaged in  both fraudulent  and legitimate \nactivities to further this purpose. Similarly, these Defendants, in their ongoing relationship with \nPlaintiffs, other workers, and Enterprise II as a whole, committed and/or conspired to commit \nacts comprising elements of the crimes of the involuntary servitude, forced labor, and human \ntrafficking-related offenses. However, not every act these Defendants committed in the context \nof these relationships constituted an element of these crimes. Therefore, the \"usual and daily \nactivities\" of this enterprise were peppered with racketeering activities, but did not solely involve \nracketeering activities. \nIII.  Enterprise III \nThe  Defendant  participants  in  this  enterprise  used  the  mails  and  wires  to  defraud \nPlaintiffs  and  other  workers,  and  committed visa  fraud,  for  the  otherwise  non-racketeering \npurpose of providing and maintaining a consistent and acquiescent Indian worker labor force at \nSignal's operations. These Defendants, through the enterprise, engaged in both fraudulent and \nlegitimate  activities  to  further  this  purpose.  Similarly,  these  Defendants,  in  their  ongoing \nrelationship  with  Plaintiffs,  other workers,  and  Enterprise  III  as  a whole,  committed and/or \nconspired to commit acts comprising elements of the crimes of the involuntary servitude, forced \nlabor,  and  human  trafficking-related  offenses.  However,  not  every  act  these  Defendants \ncommitted in the context of these relationships constituted an element these crimes. Therefore, \nthe \"usual and daily activities\" of this enterprise were peppered with racketeering activities, but \ndid not solely involve racketeering activities. \n9.  Benefits Received by the Enterprise from the Alleged Pattern of Racketeering \nActivity \nThe  members  of  the  enterprise  enjoyed  substantial  financial  profits  from  their \nracketeering activities. The Recruiter Defendants, the Labor Broker Defendants, and the Legal \n13 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 2   Filed 08/07/13   Page 14 of 18\nFacilitator Defendants, through the respective enterprises, collected significant recruitment and \nimmigration processing fees from Plaintiff, who relied on Defendants' fraudulent promises. The \nLabor Broker Defendants and Signal obtained the benefits of Plaintiff who, due to his extreme \nlevel of personal indebtedness incurred in reliance on Defendants' fraud, was desperate to pay \nthe Labor Broker Defendants for promised immigration and work opportunities and to accept \nand  maintain  employment with  Defendant  Signal.  The  unlawful  document-related  activities \ncommitted by the Recruiter Defendants, coupled with the involuntary servitude, forced labor, \nand human trafficking-related offenses committed by the Recruiter Defendants and Signal in \nconspiracy with the Legal Facilitator Defendants caused Plaintiff to  surrender and forgo other \nemployment and business opportunities and to remain working at Signal despite illegally low \nwages and large deductions for substandard and discriminatory labor camp housing. Defendant \nSignal profited from maintaining the forced labor of Plaintiff, Plaintiffs acquiescence to Signal's \nexcessive  deductions  from  his  paychecks,  and  Signal's  failure  to  reimburse  Plaintiff  for \nmandatory recruitment, visa, and travel expenses as required by United States minimum wage \nlaws. \n10.  Describe the Effect of the Activities on Interstate Commerce \nThe enterprises and Defendants identified in this action have conducted the racketeering \nactivities and other business activities relevant to this action through interstate and international \ntravel  and  communications.  Plaintiff has  traveled  and  communicated  across  state  lines  and \ninternational borders in undertaking the transactions, travel, and provision of labor and services \ninduced by Defendants' racketeering acts. Defendant Signal operates throughout the multi-state \nGulf Coast  region,  with  worksites  and  labor  camps  in  Texas  and  Mississippi.  Defendants' \nbusiness and racketeering activities (involving travel, mail and wire transactions, importation of \nforeign workers, and payment of wages within the United States), as well as actions taken by \nPlaintiff in response to and/or as a result of those activities (involving travel, mail, and wire \ntransactions, and work performed within the United States) affect interstate commerce. \n11.  Not applicable. \n12.  Not applicable. \n13.  The Complaint alleges a violation of 18 U.S.c. § 1962(c) and: \nA.  None  of the  Defendants  were,  at  any  relevant time,  employed by  any  of the \nenterprises. All Defendants are associated with Enterprise I. The Recruiter Defendants, the Legal \nFacilitator Defendants, and Defendant Signal are associated with Enterprises II and III. \nB.  The  liable  Defendant  \"persons\"  are  separate  and  distinct  entities  from  the \nenterprises alleged above. \n14.  The Complaint alleges a violation of 18 U.S.c. § 1962(d) (Description of the Alleged \nConspiracy) \nPlaintiffs assert the following RICO conspiracies in this action: \n14 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 2   Filed 08/07/13   Page 15 of 18\nThe  Defendants agreed  to  engage in mail,  wire,  and  immigration document fraud  to \nrecruit, transport,  and obtain Plaintiffs and other Indian workers for employment at  Signal's \noperations in Mississippi and Texas.  Defendant Signal authorized the Recruiter Defendants and \nthe Legal Facilitator Defendants to act as its agents for the purpose of fraudulently encouraging \nPlaintiffs to obtain an H-2B visa to come to the United States to work for SignaL The Recruiter \nDefendants, the  Legal  Facilitator Defendants,  the  Labor  Broker Defendants,  and  Defendant \nSignal  agreed  to  certain  fraudulent  communications  and  transactions  calculated  to  induce \nPlaintiffs' reasonable reliance and convince Plaintiffs to pay large sums of money to come to the \nUnited States to work for Signal. \nThe Labor Recruiters, the Legal Facilitators and Defendant Signal agreed that each would \nundertake certain measures to ensure that Plaintiff would be enticed to travel on airliners and go \nto  places  throughout  India and  the  United  States,  and  would  continue  to  work at  Signal's \noperations, resulting in involuntary servitude, forced labor, trafficking in persons, and document \nservitude. \n15.  Relationship Between Injuries and Violations of RICO \nPlaintiffs have suffered significant injuries to their business and/or property as a result of \nDefendants' racketeering activities including: payment of fees charged by Defendants and their \nagents for recruitment, travel, immigration processing, legal services, housing, and food; interest \non loans undertaken by Plaintiffs to pay fees charged by Defendants; lost and unpaid wages, lost \npersonal property abandoned at the labor camps, and lost work and professional opportunities. \nAll  Defendants'  acts  of mail,  wire,  and  visa fraud  effectuated  and  directly  induced \nPlaintiffs to pay exorbitant sums of money to the Recruiter Defendants, the Legal Facilitator \nDefendants,  and  the  Labor  Broker  Defendants  by  promising  that  Plaintiffs  would  receive \npermanent immigration status for themselves and their family and lucrative work in the United \nStates.  Relying  on  Defendants'  fraudulent  promises,  Plaintiffs  incurred  substantial  interest-\nbearing debts and  sold personal  and  real  property to  obtain the  funds  necessary to  pay the \nRecruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants and Labor Broker Defendants. \nDefendants' acts of inducement into slavery, involuntary servitude, document servitude, \ntrafficking in persons, and forced labor caused Plaintiffs to make substantial payments to the \nRecruiter Defendants upon departing India for the United States, and caused Plaintiffs to remain \nworking at Signal despite  illegally low wages and wage deductions for housing and food at \nSignal's labor camps. These acts also coerced Plaintiffs to surrender and forgo other employment \nopportunities and to suffer emotional distress. \n16.  Actual Damages Sustained by Reason of RICO Violations \nDamages Resulting from Defendants' Mail. Wire, and Visa Fraud: \nIn reliance on Defendants' fraudulent promises regarding green cards and as a result of \nDefendants' conspiracy to make these fraudulent representations, Plaintiffs spent an estimated \n15 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 2   Filed 08/07/13   Page 16 of 18\n$15,000 to $20,000 or more to pay the mandatory fees charged by the Recruiter Defendants, the \nLabor Broker Defendants,  and  the  Legal  Facilitator Defendants.  Each  Plaintiff made  three \nseparate  installment  payments  of $2,750.00  to  the  Recruiter  Defendants,  the  Labor  Broker \nDefendants, and the Legal Facilitator Defendants.  Plaintiffs were also forced to incur expenses \nrelated to transportation/travel to attend the informational meetings, attend the interview at the \nU.S. Consulate and the administration of the practical and written skills tests. In addition, these \nDefendants required that Plaintiff Sabu make an \"advance\" payment to \"Salimon\", an associate \nof Sachin Dewan and Dewan Consultants for 25,000 rupees. Dewan and Dewan Consultants also \nforced Plaintiffs to make a cash payment directly to Dewan with each installment payment for \n75,000 rupees (225,000 rupees total).  At the time the Plaintiffs delivered the third installment \npayments, Plaintiff Sabu was also forced to make separate payments to Malvern Burnett and \nMichal Pol for $740.00 and $2,490.00, respectively. In addition, Plaintiffs were forced to pay \ntheir own travel expenses to the United States, estimated at 48,000 to 60,000 rupees each. \nDamages as a Result of Defendants' Involuntary Servitude, Forced Labor, and Human \nTrafficking-Related RICO Violations: \nPlaintiffs suffered damages as a result of Defendants', Defendants'  agents, employees \nand/or representatives subjecting them to and/or conspiring to subject them to enticement into \nslavery,  involuntary  servitude,  forced  labor,  human  trafficking,  and  document  servitude. \nPlaintiffs' damages include, but are not limited to, the damages resulting from the fraud-related \nacts delineated above. Plaintiffs are also entitled to damages for rent charges and loss of work \nopportunities in the U.S. during and after their employment with Signal ceased. Because these \ndamages continue to accrue, a specific amount cannot currently be calculated. \nWith respect  to  these  predicate  acts,  the  Recruiter  Defendants,  the  Legal  Facilitator \nDefendants, and Signal are jointly and severally liable for related damages. \nAll Violations: \nWith respect to all Defendants' RICO violations, Plaintiffs seek treble damages pursuant \nto 18 U,S.C § 1964(c), plus costs and attorneys' fees associated with bringing this action. \n17.  All Other Federal Causes of Action \nA. Plaintiffs bring the following additional federal claims in this action: \n1.  Trafficking Victims Protection Act of2003 (TVPA), 18 U.S.C. § 1589 \nH.

Signal (08-1220); Achari v. Signal (13-6218); Samuel v. \nSignal (14-2811); Joseph v. Signal (14-2826) \n     \nORDER AND REASONS \n \n  Before the Court are the Dewan Defendants’ Motions for Summary Judgment on \nthe crossclaims of Co-Defendant Signal International, LLC (“Signal”).1 Signal opposes the \nMotions.2 The Dewan Defendants have also filed reply memoranda in further support of \nthe Motions for Summary Judgment. The Court has considered these briefs, the record, \nand the applicable law, and now issues its ruling. For the reasons that follow, the Motions \nfor Summary Judgment are GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.  \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n  This matter arises out of an allegedly unlawful recruitment scheme used by Signal \nto recruit and employ citizens of India in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.3 Plaintiffs, \n                                                   \n1 This Order and Reasons applies to the identical Motions for Summary Judgment currently pending in \nDavid v. Signal (08-1220), R. Docs. 2396, 2397; Achari v. Signal (13-6218), R. Docs. 504, 507; Samuel v. \nSignal (14-2811), R. Docs. 219, 220; and Joseph v. Signal (14-2826), R. Docs. 216, 217. The motions were \noriginally filed by Defendant Malvern C. Burnett, the Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, LLC, and the \nLaw Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, APC (“the Burnett Defendants”).  Defendants Sachin Dewan and Dewan \nConsultants, Pvt. Ltd. (“the Dewan Defendants”), thereafter joined in the motions. The Burnett Defendants \nare no longer defendants to this action. Accordingly, for purposes of this Order and Reasons, the Court \ntreats the Motions for Summary Judgment solely as that of the Dewan Defendants.  \n2 R. Doc. 513 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). For simplicity, the Court, where necessary, refers to the \nMotions for Summary Judgment and related briefs by citing the document numbers assigned those filings \nin Achari v. Signal (13-6218). The document numbers related to the Motions in the other relevant cases are \nreflected, supra, in footnote 1. \n3 See generally R. Doc. 200 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n2 \n \n\na number of the recruited Indian workers, allege that Signal, among others, recruited \nPlaintiffs  to  work  at  Signal’s  facilities  in  Pascagoula,  Mississippi,  post-Hurricane \nKatrina.4 Signal allegedly promised Plaintiffs that, in connection with the recruitment \nscheme, it would assist Plaintiffs in acquiring permanent residence in the United States.5 \nPlaintiffs contend, however, that Signal never followed through with these promises or \ntook steps to assist Plaintiffs in obtaining green cards.6 Moreover, Plaintiffs argue, inter \nalia, that they experienced discriminatory treatment at the hands of Signal and were \nforced to live in deplorable conditions.7  \n  The present Motions for Summary Judgment concern the crossclaims levied by \nSignal against the Burnett Defendants and the Dewan Defendants in (1) David v. Signal \n(08-1220); (2) the consolidated cases in Achari v. Signal (13-6218);8 (3) Samuel v. Signal \n(14-2811); and (4) Joseph v. Signal (14-2826). Judgment was entered on the crossclaims \nin  the  first  David  trial9  against  Signal  and  in  favor  of  the  Burnett  and  Dewan \nDefendants.10 The Dewan Defendants contend in the present Motions that, because \n“identical” crossclaims were alleged and adjudicated in the first David trial,11 Signal’s \n                                                   \n4 R. Doc. 200 at 4–5 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n5 R. Doc. 200 at 6 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n6 R. Doc. 200 at 6–7 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n7 R. Doc. 200 at 7 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n8 Signal filed crossclaims against the Burnett and Dewan Defendants in each of the cases consolidated in \nAchari v. Signal. These consolidated cases, along with the document number of Signal’s crossclaims in \nthose cases, include: Thomas v. Signal (14-1818), R. Doc. 370 (E.D. La.); Achari v. Signal (13-6218), R. \nDoc. 642 (E.D. La.); Chakkiyattil v. Signal (13-6219), R. Doc. 643 (E.D. La.); Krishnakutty v. Signal (13-\n6220), R. Doc. 644 (E.D. La.); Devassy v. Signal (13-6221), R. Doc. 645 (E.D. La.); Singh v. Signal (14-\n732), R. Doc. 646 (E.D. La.). \n9 The first David trial involved only 5 of the Plaintiffs in David. The claims of the remaining 7 Plaintiffs \nagainst the Dewan Defendants, as well as Signal’s related crossclaims against the Dewan Defendants, \nremain pending in David. \n10 R. Doc. 504 at 2 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218); R. Doc. 504-1 at 2–3 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n11 Counts 1 through 8 were resolved prior to trial when the Court granted judgment as a matter of law in \nfavor of the Burnett and Dewan Defendants. See David v. Signal (08-1220), R. Doc. 2265. The jury found \nin favor of the Burnett and Dewan Defendants on the indemnity crossclaims. See David v. Signal (08-1220), \nR.

Summary Judgment Standard \n  Summary judgment is appropriate only “if the movant shows that there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter \nof law.”12 “An issue is material if its resolution could affect the outcome of the action.”13 \nWhen assessing whether a material factual dispute exists, the Court considers “all of the \nevidence in the record but refrains from making credibility determinations or weighing \nthe evidence.”14 All reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the non-moving party.15 \nThere is no genuine issue of material fact if, even viewing the evidence in the light most \nfavorable to the non-moving party, no reasonable trier of fact could find for the non-\nmoving party, thus entitling the moving party to judgment as a matter of law.16   \nB.  Res Judicata Standard \n“Under the doctrine of res judicata, parties and their privies are precluded from \nrelitigating claims that were or should have been raised in a prior action and have reached \na  final  judgment  on  the  merits.”17  For  the  doctrine  of  res  judicata  to  apply,  four \nrequirements must be satisfied: (1) the parties must be identical in both suits, or the \n                                                   \n12 Fed.

McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94 (1980) (“The doctrine \nof res judicata, or claim preclusion, forecloses relitigation of claims that were or could have been raised in \na prior action.”). \n4 \n \n\nparties must be in privity with parties who were identical in both suits; (2) the prior \njudgment must have been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (3) the prior \njudgment must have been a final judgment on the merits; and (4) the same claim or cause \nof action must be involved in both suits.18 \nDISCUSSION \nIt is undisputed that the first two requirements of the res judicata analysis are \nsatisfied in this case.19 The Dewan Defendants and Signal agree that (1) the parties in the \ncrossclaims are identical or in privity; and (2) the crossclaims in the first David trial were \ndecided by a court of competent jurisdiction. The principal disputes with respect to the \npresent Motions for Summary Judgment concern the third and fourth requirements of \nthe res judicata analysis. The Court will address each requirement, in turn, below. \nA.  Final Judgment on the Merits \nThe third requirement of the res judicata inquiry, as recited above, requires that \nthe prior judgment be a final judgment on the merits.20 The Dewan Defendants contend \nit is “self evident” that the prior judgment on Signal’s crossclaims in the first David trial \nis final and on the merits, noting that a “verdict was issued as a result of a trial o[n] the \nmerits and Judgment was issued pursuant to Rule 54(b).”21 Signal, on the other hand, \ndisputes the assertion that the first David trial resulted in  a final judgment on its \ncrossclaims.22 Signal argues that, because it has appealed the Court’s judgment on its \ncrossclaims, the judgment is not final for purposes of res judicata.23 More specifically, \n                                                   \n18 See, e.g., Swate v. Hartwell (In re Swate), 99 F.3d 1282, 1286 (5th Cir. 1996);  \n19 R. Doc. 504-2 at 4–5 (in the Achari cases); R. Doc. 513 at 4 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n20 See supra note 18 and accompanying text. \n21 R. Doc. 504-2 at 5 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n22 R. Doc. 513 at 5 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n23 R. Doc. 513 at 5 (in the Achari cases). Signal states that the pendency of its appeal should “defeat” the \nfinality argument. R. Doc. 513 at 5 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n5 \n \n\nSignal  contends  the  pendency  of  an  appeal  renders  the  appealed-from  judgment \n“insufficiently final” for res judicata purposes.  \nUnder Fifth Circuit case law, it is immaterial for res judicata purposes that a prior \njudgment has been appealed. The Fifth Circuit has specifically held that “[a] case pending \nappeal is res judicata and entitled to full faith and credit unless and until reversed on \nappeal.”24 Signal’s argument to the contrary, that its taking of an appeal renders the \nCourt’s judgment “insufficiently final,” is incorrect.25 Signal’s appeal has, for res judicata \npurposes, no bearing on the finality of the Court’s judgment on Signal’s crossclaims in the \nfirst David trial. As a result, the Court finds the third requirement of the res judicata \ninquiry satisfied. The judgment on Signal’s crossclaims in the first David trial is, for \npurposes of res judicata, final and on the merits. The Court now turns to the fourth \nrequirement. \nB.   Same Claims or Causes of Action \nThe fourth requirement of the res judicata inquiry, as recited above, requires that \nthe same claims or causes of action be involved in both suits.26 To determine whether two \nsuits involve the same claims or causes of action, the Fifth Circuit instructs courts to use \nthe “transactional test” of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments, § 24.27 Under the \n                                                   \n24 Comer v. Murphy Oil USA, 718 F.3d 460, 467 (5th Cir. 2013) (quoting Fid. Standard Life Ins. Co. v. First \nNat’l Bank & Trust Co., 510 F.2d 272, 273 (5th Cir. 1975) (per curiam)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nSee also United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 39 (1950); 18A CHARLES A. WRIGHT & ARTHUR D. \nMILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 4427 (2d ed. 2012). \n25 Signal cites Griggs v. United States, 253 F. App’x 405 (5th Cir. 2007), for the proposition that a judgment, \nwhen appealed, is insufficiently final for res judicata purposes. R. Doc. 513 at 5–6. Signal’s reliance on \nGriggs for this conclusion is inapposite. Griggs does not hold that a judgment, if appealed, is not final for \nres judicata purposes. Instead, the Fifth Circuit in Griggs noted, in dicta, that a judgment, which is not \nappealed, is final, though that judgment may be erroneous or based on law that is no longer controlling. See \nGriggs, 253 F. App’x at 411. \n26 See supra note 18 and accompanying text. \n27 See, e.g., In re Southmark Corp., 163 F.3d 925, 934 (5th Cir. 1999) (citing Southmark Prop. v. Charles \nHouse Corp., 742 F.2d 862, 870–71 (5th Cir. 1984)); see also Petro-Hunt, L.L.C. v. U.S., 365 F.3d 385, 395–\n96 (5th Cir. 2004). \n6 \n \n\ntransactional test, a prior judgment’s preclusive effect extends “to all or any part of the \ntransaction,  or  series  of  connected  transactions,  out  of  which  the  [original]  action \narose.”28 Which grouping of facts constitutes a “transaction” or a “series of transactions” \nmust “be determined pragmatically, giving weight to such considerations as whether the \nfacts are related in time, space, origin, or motivation, whether they form a convenient trial \nunit, and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties’ expectations or \nbusiness understanding or usage.”29 The critical issue under the transactional test is \nwhether the two actions or suits are based on the “same nucleus of operative facts.”30  \nIn the first David trial, Signal’s crossclaims were enumerated in 10 separate \ncounts.31 Counts 1 through 8 were Signal’s crossclaims for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, \nmalpractice, two counts of breach of contract, unfair trade practices, detrimental reliance, \nand tortious interference with a contractual relationship.32 Counts 9 and 10 were Signal’s \ncrossclaims for indemnity against the Burnett and Dewan Defendants.33 Signal does not \ndispute that Counts 1 through 8 arise out of the “same nucleus of operative facts” as its \ncorresponding, non-indemnity crossclaims in the remaining portion of the David case, \nthe  consolidated  Achari  cases,  and  the  Samuel  and  Joseph  cases.34  Indeed,  Signal \nconcedes that its non-indemnity crossclaims in these cases satisfy the fourth requirement \nof the res judicata inquiry and involve the same claims or causes of action as Signal’s non-\n                                                   \n28 Petro-Hunt, 365 F.3d at 395–96 (quoting RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF JUDGMENTS § 24(1) (1982)) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). \n29 Id.

Prior to the trial in David, the Court dismissed Counts \n1 through 8 of Signal’s crossclaims, granting the Burnett and Dewan Defendants judgment as a matter of \nlaw. David v. Signal (08-1220), R. Doc. 2265. \n33 David v. Signal (08-1220), R. Doc. 1748 at 102–104. \n34 See R. Doc. 513 at 8–9 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n7 \n \n\nindemnity crossclaims adjudicated in the first David trial. Because the parties agree that \nthe first and second requirements of the res judicata analysis are met, and because the \nCourt has found that the third and fourth requirements are met, Signal’s non-indemnity \ncrossclaims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata as a result of the judgment in the \nfirst David trial. \nThe indemnity counts of Signal’s crossclaims—Counts 9 and 10 in the first David \ntrial—require a more lengthy and involved analysis.35 Signal argues, in sum, that its \nindemnity crossclaims against the Burnett and Dewan Defendants in the first David trial \nwere not based on the same nucleus of operative facts as Signal’s indemnity crossclaims \nin the remaining portion of the David case, the consolidated Achari cases, and the Samuel \nand Joseph cases.36 Signal contends its crossclaims for indemnity necessarily involve facts \nspecific to each individual Plaintiff and that the “facts surrounding a given Plaintiff’s \nrecruitment” are dispositive of Signal’s crossclaims for indemnity in each particular \ncase.37 As such, Signal avers that, because facts specific to the remaining Plaintiffs in \nDavid,  the  Plaintiffs  in  Achari,  and  the  Plaintiffs  in  Samuel  and  Joseph  were  not \npresented and adjudicated at the first David trial, Signal’s indemnity crossclaims should \nnot be barred by the doctrine of res judicata.38 \nThe Dewan Defendants, on the other hand, argue that, with respect to Signal’s \nindemnity crossclaims, “the category of damages, the alleged basis of recovery, and the \noperative facts on which [Signal] bases its claim for recovery are the same as presented in \nDavid.”39  The  Dewan  Defendants  maintain  the  “only  difference”  is  the  “amount  of \n                                                   \n35 See R. Doc. 513 at 9 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218).  \n36 See R. Doc. 513 at 9–10 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n37 R. Doc. 513 at 9–12 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n38 R. Doc. 513 at 13–14 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n39 R. Doc. 504-2 at 11 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n8 \n \n\ndamages, if any, for which Signal may be held responsible.”40 The Dewan Defendants do \nnot agree that Signal’s indemnity crossclaims against the Burnett and Dewan Defendants \nare “plaintiff specific” and turn on the particular facts surrounding the recruitment of \neach Plaintiff.  \nThe  Court  agrees  with  Signal.  Signal’s  crossclaims  for  indemnity  against  the \nBurnett and Dewan Defendants do require a “plaintiff-specific” analysis. In reaching this \nconclusion, the Court notes that, in the first David trial, the portion of the Jury Verdict \nForm which addressed Signal’s crossclaims for indemnity against the Burnett and Dewan \nDefendants required an analysis of the facts and circumstances unique to the Plaintiffs in \nthat case.41 Specifically, with respect to Signal’s indemnity crossclaims, the Jury Verdict \nForm referenced the “legal obligation” owed by Signal to the “Plaintiffs in the main \naction” and whether, “in all fairness,” the Burnett or Dewan Defendants should indemnify \nSignal for that legal obligation owed by Signal to those specific Plaintiffs.42 Accordingly, \nin reaching a verdict on Signal’s indemnity crossclaims in the first David trial, the jury \nwas required to consider the specific circumstances and testimony of the Plaintiffs and \ndetermine whether the Burnett and Dewan Defendants were required to indemnify Signal \nfor  Signal’s  conduct  with  respect  to  those  five  David  Plaintiffs  whose  claims  were \npresented in the first trial. \nAt the first David trial and, specifically, during cross examination, Signal elicited \ntestimony from each Plaintiff as to the conduct of the Burnett and Dewan Defendants and \nhow each Plaintiff’s experience with Burnett and Dewan was unique and distinct. For \nexample, each Plaintiff was asked about unauthorized actions of Burnett and Dewan that \n                                                   \n40 R. Doc. 504-2 at 11–12 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n41 See David v. Signal (08-1220), R. Doc. 2268-2 at 78–83. \n42 See David v. Signal (08-1220), R. Doc. 2268-2 at 78–83 (emphasis added). \n9 \n \n\nwere relevant to whether the Burnett and Dewan Defendants would be required to \nindemnify Signal for Signal’s conduct vis-à-vis those David Plaintiffs. \nThe Court is not persuaded by the argument, set forth by the Dewan Defendants, \nthat Signal’s indemnity crossclaims involve only an assessment of Signal’s and the Burnett \nand Dewan Defendants’ conduct vis-à-vis each other.43 As stated above, whether the \nBurnett and Dewan Defendants were required by law to indemnify Signal in the first \nDavid trial turned on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the individual \nPlaintiffs  in  that  trial.  Signal’s  indemnity  crossclaims  in  the  first  David  trial  are \nnecessarily distinct and do not involve the same claims or causes of action as Signal’s \nindemnity crossclaims in the remaining portion of David, the consolidated Achari cases, \nor the Samuel or Joseph cases. Signal’s crossclaims for indemnity against the Burnett and \nDewan Defendants are not barred by the doctrine of res judicata. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Signal’s crossclaims for indemnity \nagainst  the  Dewan  Defendants  in  the  remaining  portion  of  the  David  case,  the \nconsolidated Achari cases, and the Samuel and Joseph cases are not barred by the \ndoctrine of res judicata. Signal’s non-indemnity crossclaims are barred under the doctrine \nof res judicata. \n  Accordingly; \n  IT IS ORDERED that the Dewan Defendants’ Motions for Summary Judgment44 \nare hereby GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Signal’s non-indemnity \ncrossclaims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Signal’s crossclaims for indemnity \n                                                   \n43 See R. Doc. 524 at 5–6 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n44 R. Doc. 504 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n10 \n \n\nagainst the Burnett and Dewan Defendants are, for the reasons stated above, not barred \nby the doctrine of res judicata. \nNew Orleans, Louisiana, this 1st day of December, 2015. \n \n_______ _____________ _______ \nSUSIE MORGAN \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n11 \n ",

After due\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 26   Filed 10/18/13   Page 2 of 10\nconsideration, the Court concludes that consolidation for the purpose of considering\ntransfer is appropriate, and that the Mississippi cases should be transferred to the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, where a\nsubstantially similar case was first filed and is pending.  Accordingly, the motions\nto consolidate and transfer will be granted.  The Court declines to rule on any\nremaining motions, leaving them for determination by the transferee court.  \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\nSignal seeks consolidation, stay and transfer of four cases to the Eastern\nDistrict of Louisiana.  The four are this case (“Achari”), Chakkiyattl v. Signal, No.\n13cv318-LG-JMR (“Chakkiyattl”), Krishnakutty v. Signal, No. 13cv319-LG-JMR\n(“Krishnakutty”), and Devassy v. Signal, 1:13cv327-HSO-RHW (“Devassy”).1  Signal\nargues that these cases are closely related to a similar lawsuit filed in the Eastern\nDistrict of Louisiana in March 2008, David, et al. v. Signal, et al., No. 2:08-CV-\n1220-JCZ-DEK (\"David\").  Signal submits that under the \"first filed\" rule, the four\ncases should be transferred so that their issues can be resolved with David.\nThe Eastern District of Louisiana district judge summarized the David\nplaintiffs’ claims as alleging a scheme to lure foreign workers to work for Signal in\nMississippi and Texas with the promise of permanent residence in the United\nStates.  Once in the United States, the David plaintiffs alleged they were subjected\nto discrimination and adverse working and living conditions.  The plaintiffs allege\n1  Devassy was recently consolidated with Achari. \n-2-\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 26   Filed 10/18/13   Page 3 of 10\nthat the recruitment defendants obtained millions of dollars in fees and Signal\nobtained workers for a lesser cost than if it hired American workers.

Several\nplaintiffs also bring individual claims of retaliation under § 1981 and § 1985, and\nclaims of false imprisonment, assault, battery, and infliction of emotional distress.  \nThe plaintiffs in these Mississippi cases were previously among the plaintiffs\nin the David case who sought to be certified as a class.  After class certification was\ndenied by the Louisiana district court judge, they filed complaints in this Court. \n2  The David Defendants are: Signal International L.L.C; Malvern C.\nBurnett; Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, L.L.C.; Law Offices of Malvern C.\nBurnett, A.P.C.; Indo-Ameri Soft L.L.C.; Kurella Rao; J & M Associates, Inc. of\nMississippi; Billy R.

Motion to Consolidate\nSignal contends that the above cases should be consolidated only for the\npurpose of deciding whether the first-filed rule requires the Court to transfer the\ncases to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. \nSignal argues that the first-filed rule applies equally to all the cases it wishes to\nconsolidate for the purpose of transfer. \nThe plaintiffs argue that consolidation will not aid the Court as a matter of\nconvenience and judicial economy.  Plaintiffs contend that even though all four\ncases stem from David, they bring different claims against different defendants,\nand so individual attention must be given to each case in making the transfer\ndecision.  \nThe Court has broad discretion in determining whether and to what extent to\nconsolidate cases.

The question of whether these cases should be\ntransferred to the Eastern District of Louisiana pursuant to the first-filed rule will\nrequire analysis of a single body of law in relation to each case.  The summary\nabove of each case shows that there is substantial similarity in the underlying facts\nand theories of recovery.  The Court finds that considering the cases together will\nresult in judicial economy.  Accordingly, the Motion to Consolidate will be granted.\nII.  Motion to Stay and Transfer Pursuant to the First-to-File Rule\nThe \"first to file\" rule permits a district court to decline jurisdiction over an\naction when it involves the same parties and issues as a previously-filed action in\nanother court.  When related cases are pending before two federal courts, the court\nin which the case was last filed may dismiss or transfer the case if it involves\nsubstantially similar issues which can be resolved in the earlier-filed action. See W.\nGulf Mar. Ass'n v. ILA Deep Sea Local 24, 751 F.2d 721, 728-29 (5th Cir. 1985) and\nSave Power Ltd. v. Syntek Fin. Corp., 121 F.3d 947, 950 (5th Cir. 1997).  “The\nconcern manifestly is to avoid the waste of duplication, to avoid rulings which may\ntrench upon the authority of sister courts, and to avoid piecemeal resolution of\nissues that call for a uniform result.”  W. Gulf Mar. Ass'n, 751 F.2d at 728. \nThe Court's inquiry is focused on whether the cases \"substantially overlap,\"\nbut where the overlap is \"less than complete, the judgment is made case by case,\nbased on such factors as the extent of overlap, the likelihood of conflict, the\ncomparative advantage and the interest of each forum in resolving the dispute.”\nSave Power Ltd., 121 F.3d at 951.  The first-to-file rule is a discretionary doctrine. \n-6-\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 26   Filed 10/18/13   Page 7 of 10\nCadle Co. v. Whataburger of Alice, Inc., 174 F.3d 599, 603 (5th Cir. 1999) (citing\nKerotest Mfg. Co. v. C-O-Two Fire Equip. Co., 342 U.S. 180, 183-84 (1952)).  It is not\na rigid or inflexible rule to be mechanically applied.  Mann Mfg., Inc. v. Hortex, Inc.,\n439 F.2d 403, 407 (5th Cir. 1971).  The decision of whether to apply the first-to-file\nrule involves determinations concerning \"[w]ise judicial administration, giving\nregard to conservation of judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of\nlitigation.\"  Kerotest, 342 U.S. at 183.  \nIn support of its motion, Signal argues that the first to file rule applies\nbecause the issues and parties in the David case completely encompass the issues\nand parties in the Mississippi cases.  Signal provides a press release by the\nSouthern Poverty Law Center as evidence that the lawyers for the plaintiffs\nacknowledged the substantial overlap of David and the Mississippi cases.  (Def.\nMemo. Ex. 1, ECF No. 12-1).  In response, the plaintiffs argue that 1) there is a\nserious question of whether the Louisiana court can exercise personal jurisdiction\nover all of the named defendants; 2) there is no overlap of parties because the\nplaintiffs in the Mississippi cases are not parties to the David case; and 3) denial of\nclass certification in David shows that there is no substantial overlap of issues.  \nIn regard to the question of substantial overlap of parties and issues, the\nCourt finds that both exist here.  The fact that the plaintiffs are no longer parties to\nthe David case does not negate the presence of many defendants in common.3  The \n3  Defendants common to David and Achari are Signal International L.L.C;\n-7-\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 26   Filed 10/18/13   Page 8 of 10\nMississippi defendants are merely subsets of the David defendants.  \nMalvern C.

In all cases, the plaintiffs allege a\nhuman trafficking scheme that induced them to emigrate from India with the\nunfulfilled promise of permanent United States residency, and the imposition of\nadverse working and living conditions.  The theories of recovery in all of the\nMississippi cases are also presented in the David case.  Finally, it should be noted\nthat failing to meet the commonality requirements for class certification is not\nequivalent to a lack of substantial overlap of issues.  There is such substantial\noverlap that the Mississippi cases should be transferred to the Eastern District of\nLouisiana for consideration of the issues.\nThe plaintiffs question the ability of the Louisiana court to assert personal\njurisdiction over all of the defendants.  If there is such a question in these cases, it\nmust also be addressed in David, as all of the defendants named in the Mississippi\ncases are also named in David.  It would be improper for this Court to analyze the\nLouisiana court’s jurisdiction in any event.  The Fifth Circuit has rejected the\nproposition that the first-to-file rule requires the second-filed court to consider the\njurisdiction of the first.  Cadle Co. v. Whataburger of Alice, Inc., 174 F.3d 599, 604-\n05 (5th Cir. 1999).  “Once the likelihood of a substantial overlap between the two\nsuits has been demonstrated, it is no longer up to the second filed court to resolve\nthe question of whether both should be allowed to proceed.”  Id. at 606 (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted).  “[T]he first-to-file rule ‘not only determines\nwhich court may decide the merits of substantially similar issues, but also\nestablishes which court may decide whether the second suit filed must be dismissed,\n-9-\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 26   Filed 10/18/13   Page 10 of 10\nstayed or transferred and consolidated.’” Street v. Smith, 456 F. Supp. 2d 761, 768\n(S.D.

Burnett (\"Burnett Law\"), Gulf \nCoast Immigration  Law Center (\"Gulf Coast  Law\"),  Sachin  Dewan (\"Dewan\")  and  Dewan \nConsultants Pvt. Ltd. (\"Dewan Consultants\") (collectively, \"Defendants,,).l \nNATURE OF THE ACTION \nI.  This is a human trafficking,  RICO,  civil rights, misrepresentation and contract \naction brought by Plaintiffs, foreign workers trafficked into Mississippi, to recover for the \nGlobal, Burnett, Burnett Law, Gulf Coast Law, Dewan, and Dewan Consultants are collectively \n1 \nreferred to herein as the \"Agents.\" \nI \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 2 of 65\nunlawful,  fraudulent,  exploitative  and outrageous  conduct  by  Signal,  labor brokers  Indo \nAmerisoft  and  Rao,  Global,  Burnett,  Burnett Law,  Gulf Coast Law,  Dewan,  and Dewan \nConsultants.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief and damages. \n2.  Defendants conspired and worked together to defraud Plaintiffs out of thousands \nof dollars, falsely promised them assistance in applying for and obtaining permanent residence \nin the United States to entice them to pay exorbitant fees to Defendants, trafficked them into \nthe  United  States,  forced  them  to  pay  to  live  in  squalid  and  unsanitary  conditions  that \nendangered their health and psychological well-being, discriminated against them on the basis \nof their race, national origin and alienage, and threatened them with financial ruin and adverse \nimmigration action. \n3.  In  the  aftermath  of the  devastation  of Hurricane  Katrina,  Signal,  a  marine \nfabrication company, sought to recruit several hundred foreign workers to work as welders \nand pipefitters for  its  Pascagoula,  Mississippi,  and  Orange,  Texas facilities.  Rather than \nhiring new  workers  from  the  Gulf Coast,  Signal instead joined an  enterprise that  falsely \npromised Indian men legal permanent residence  (referred to  as \"green cards\") to  create a \nready source of cheap labor.  Plaintiffs were 2 of approximately 590 men caught up in this \ndeception. \n4.  Beginning  in  2003,  labor  brokers  Indo-Amerisoft  and  Rao,  and  the  Agents, \nhatched a conspiracy and scheme, joined by Signal in 2006, to recruit workers from India, \nincluding  the  Plaintiffs.  In  printed  advertisements  and  in-person  meetings  in  India, \nDefendants promised the Plaintiffs that in exchange for \"recruitment fees\" of approximately \n$\\5,000, Defendants would provide Plaintiffs with ajob in the United States and assist them \nin applying for and receiving a green card. \n2 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 3 of 65\n5.  Lured by Defendants'  fraudulent promises of legal  and permanent work-based \nimmigration  to  the  United  States  for  themselves  and  their  families,  Plaintiffs  plunged \nthemselves  and  their families  into  debt  to  take  advantage  of these  seemingly  promising \nopportunities, selling family  treasures  and other personal and real  property,  and incurring \nsignificant debt at usurious rates.  Plaintiffs did this because they believed they would recoup \nthe  expense  through  the  high  wages  they  were  promised  and  through  the  long-term \nemployment opportunities that would be available to them and their families as permanent \nresidents of the United States.  Trusting in the veracity of the immigration and work benefits \npromised by Defendants, Plaintiffs also relinquished stable employment opportunities in India \nand in the Persian Gulf. \n6.  In actuality, Defendants' promises to Plaintiffs were illusory, and knowingly false \nwhen made.  Defendants had not taken, and had no intention of taking, any steps to assist \nPlaintiffs  in  applying  for  or  receiving  a  green  card.  To  the  contrary,  Signal,  with  the \nknowledge  and  assistance  of  the  other  Defendants,  represented  to  the  United  States \ngovernment that it would employ the workers only temporarily, and that the workers would be \nreturned to  India \"within the year.\"  At  no  point did  Defendants take any  steps to assist \nPlaintiffs in applying for or receiving a green card. \n7.  Defendants  held  Plaintiffs'  passports  and  Visas,  and  threatened,  coerced,  and \ndefrauded Plaintiffs into paying extraordinary fees  for recruitment, immigration processing, \nand travel.  Defendants further caused Plaintiffs to believe that if they did not work for Signal \nunder the auspices of temporary, Signal-restricted H·2B guest worker visas, they would suffer \nabuse or threatened abuse of the legal process, physical restraint, or other serious harm. \n8.  Upon arrival at Signal's facilities in Pascagoula, Plaintiffs' plight only worsened. \nSignal utilized psychological abuse, coercion, and fraud to make Plaintiffs afraid and unable \n3 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 4 of 65\nto leave Signal's facilities and employ.  Plaintiffs were housed in so-called \"man camps\" so \nthat they would not mix with the Pascagoula community, enduring prison-like conditions that \ncan only be described as  inhumane.  Plaintiffs were among several hundred men crammed \ninto trailer-like bunkhouses that were far too small for the number of men housed therein, and \notherwise unfit for human habitation.  Privacy was non-existent.  Toilet and bathing facilities \nwere insufficient.  Food was often rotten.  Signal's private \"security guards\" patrolled the \ngrounds  like  prison  guards,  often  preventing the  Plaintiffs  from  leaving the  grounds  and \nsubjecting Plaintiffs to random searches oftheir person and belongings. \n9.  For the \"privilege\" of living in prison-like squalor, Signal deducted $35 per day \nfrom Plaintiffs' paychecks, seven days a week, which constituted over 34% of their pre-tax \nearnings.  When workers requested permission to live off-site, they were told by Signal that \nthey could do so, but that Signal would continue to collect the $35 per day.  This compulsory \ndeduction essentially prohibited Plaintiffs from living in more humane conditions.  With 24 \nmen living in a trailer at a time, this amounted to over $25,000 per month per trailer being \npaid to Signal. \n10.  Non-Indian  workers  were  not  subjected  to  such  squalid  living  conditions, \ndegrading treatment, mandatory \"man camp\" deductions from their paychecks, or extortionate \nroom and board policies.  Plaintiffs also were subjected to unsafe working conditions that \nnon-Indian workers were not subjected to, and were forced to endure anti-Indian invective \nfrom Signal personnel, along with threats to deport them if they did not do  Signal's every \nbidding. \n11.  Consistent  with  Signal's  unrelenting  effort  to  improve  its  bottom  line  by \ntransferring as many costs associated with their employment as possible back onto Plaintiffs, \nSignal never refunded the  \"recruitment fees\"  Plaintiffs had paid in exchange for low-paid \n4 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 5 of 65\nwork.  Plaintiffs never earned enough money at  Signal to  make  the exorbitant and debt-\ninducing \"recruitment fees\" even remotely worthwhile.  Moreover, Signal never compensated \nPlaintiffs in any way for the physical, emotional, and  psychological degradations inflicted \nupon Plaintiffs. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1331, 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a), 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), 28 U.S.c. § 1343, and 28 U.S.C. § 1367. \n13.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over all Defendants pursuant to Miss. Code \n§ 13-3-57  and  otherwise.  Individually and through  their agents,  associates,  attorneys,  or \nemployees, all Defendants have significant contacts with Mississippi. \n(a)  Defendant Signal maintains a continuing business presence in Mississippi, \nincluding, without limitation, two shipyards in Pascagoula, Mississippi, where the \nPlaintiffs worked and lived and where much of the wrongful  conduct alleged \nherein occurred. \n(b)  Defendant  Indo-Amerisoft  has  substantial  business  contacts  with \nMississippi;  it traveled to  Mississippi  in connection with the events described \nherein (both individually and on behalf of the other Defendants), it committed \ntorts in Mississippi, and it recruited workers and delivered them for employment \nin Mississippi. \n(c)  Defendant  Rao  has  substantial  business  contacts  with  Mississippi;  he \ntraveled  to  Mississippi  in  connection  with  the  events  described  herein  (both \nindividually  and  on  behalf of the  other  Defendants),  he  committed  torts  in \nMississippi,  and he  recruited  workers  and  delivered  them  for  employment  in \nMississippi. \n(d)  Defendant  Global  is  incorporated  under  the  laws  of Mississippi,  its \nprincipal place of business is located in Mississippi, its sole officer and principal \n(Michael Pol) resides  in Mississippi, and it served as Signal's agent to  recruit \nworkers and deliver them for employment in Mississippi. \n(e)  Defendant Burnett practices law and is registered to vote in Mississippi, he \ncontracted with Global and Dewan Consultants in connection with the scheme \nalleged herein for acts in whole or in part to be performed in Mississippi, and he \nserved as Signal's agent to recruit workers and deliver them for employment in \nMississippi. \n5 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 6 of 65\n(f)  Defendant Burnett Law has offices in Mississippi where much of the legal \nwork in  furtherance  of Defendants'  schemes  was performed,  and  it  served as \nSignal's agent to recruit workers and deliver them for employment in Mississippi. \n(g)  Defendant Gulf Coast Law has offices in Mississippi where much of the \nlegal work in furtherance of Defendants' schemes was performed, and it served as \nSignal's agent to recruit workers and deliver them for employment in Mississippi. \n(h)  Defendant Dewan has substantial business contacts with Mississippi; he \ntraveled  to  Mississippi  in  connection  with  the  events  described  herein  (both \nindividually  and  on  behalf of the  other  Defendants),  he  committed  torts  in \nMississippi, and he served as Signal's agent to recruit workers and deliver them \nfor employment in Mississippi. \n(i)  Defendant  Dewan  Consultants  has  substantial  business  contacts  with \nMississippi; it traveled to  Mississippi in connection with the  events described \nherein (both individually and on behalf of the other Defendants),  it  contracted \nwith Global and Burnett in connection with the scheme alleged herein for acts to \nbe performed in whole or in part in Mississippi, and it served as Signal's agent to \nrecruit workers and deliver them for employment in Mississippi. \n14.  Venue is proper in the Southern District of Mississippi under 18 U.S.c. § 1965 \nand 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because much of Defendants' trafficking activity, civil rights violations, \nfraud, breach of contract, misrepresentations and a substantial portion of the communications, \ntransactions, events or omissions underlying Plaintiffs'  claims occurred in and around the \nPascagoula area. \nPARTIES \nIS.  Plaintiff Sabu is an Indian national, ofIndian descent, and is a former H-2B guest \nworker who was recruited from India by Defendants between 2003 and 2006 and worked at \nSignal's Pascagoula facility after arriving in the  United States on or about November  28, \n2006.  Sabu paid Indo-Amerisoft, Rao  and/or the  Agents the  equivalent of approximately \n$15,000  in \"recruitment fees\"  based on the  false  promise  that they would  assist him in \napplying  for  and receiving a green card.  Sabu also was  forced  to  pay additional \"fees\" \ndirectly to Dewan, Michael Pol and Burnett as well as fees for skills tests and medical exams. \nSabu further incurred transportation expenses each time he was required to travel outside of \n6 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 7 of 65\nhis home in Kerala, India to attend a recruitment meeting, deliver payments, or take a skills \ntest or exam.

At all relevant times, Plaintiffs were engaged in interstate commerce and/or in the \nproduction of goods for sale in interstate commerce. \n28.  At  all  relevant  times,  Defendants  operated  enterprises  engaged  in  interstate \ncommerce or in the production of goods for interstate commerce. \n29.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants  Dewan,  Dewan  Consultants,  Global \n(and its principal Michael Pol) and the  Burnett Defendants engaged in a joint venture to \nconduct and effectuate their shared business interests and activities in the United States. \n30.  Upon information and belief, the Burnett Defendants, Indo-Amerisoft and Rao \nengaged  in  a joint venture  to  conduct  and  carry  out  their  shared  business  interests  and \nactivities in India and the United Arab Emirates.  This joint venture is in addition to the joint \nventure described above between the Defendants Dewan, Dewan Consultants, Global and the \nBurnett Defendants. \n31.  At all relevant times,  Defendants Dewan, Dewan Consultants, Global,  and the \nBurnett Defendants acted as agents of Defendants Signal and/or Indo-Amerisoft and Rao for \nthe purposes of recruiting,  obtaining, contracting, transporting and providing Plaintiffs for \nlabor or services. \n32.  The false promises, collection of exorbitant recruiting fees, and strong-arm tactics \nof Defendants were, upon information and belief, authorized and/or ratified by Signal, which, \nin any event, learned in detail of these facts from the very first Indian H-2B workers who \narrived at Signal's facilities in the United States as early as late October 2006. Far from taking \nany corrective measures, Signal ratified and perpetuated the scheme by continuing to facilitate \nthe  transportation  of further  waves  of Indian  H-2B  workers,  including  Plaintiffs,  from \nNovember 2006 through April 2007. \n9 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 10 of 65\nSUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS \nThe Initial Recruitment Process \n33.  Beginning in 2003  and  continuing through at least  2006,  Defendants  Dewan, \nDewan Consultants, and Global placed ads in various newspapers across India and the United \nArab Emirates, seeking welders, fitters,  and other marine fabrication workers on behalf of \nvarious U.S.-based companies and individuals, including Defendants Indo-Amerisoft and Rao. \n34.  Upon information and belief, Dewan, Dewan Consultants, and Global placed such \nads in coordination and agreement with the Burnett Defendants, Indo-Amerisoft and Rao. \n35.  Upon information and belief, from at least December 2003 through mid-2004, the \nAgents  frequently  communicated  and  consulted  via  mail,  fax,  e-mail  and  telephone  to \ncoordinate  and  direct  Defendants'  recruitment  activities,  including  advertising  efforts  on \nbehalf of Indo-Amerisoft and Rao. \n36.  The advertisements placed by the Agents promised that qualified candidates could \nobtain  legal  permanent  residence  (\"green  cards\")  and  thereby  legally  and  permanently \nimmigrate to the United States with their families. \nPlaintiff Sabu's Initial Recruitment \n37.  In the fall of2003, Plaintiff Sabu saw the advertisement placed by the Agents (on \nbehalf of Indo-Amerisoft and Rao) in the Malayalam Manorama, a local newspaper, stating \nthat there were opportunities for work in the United States and permanent residency visas. \nThe advertisement included a phone number for the offices of Dewan Consultants in Mwnbai. \n38.  Soon  after  seeing  this  advertisement,  Sabu  contacted  the  offices  of Dewan \nConsultants and spoke directly with Dewan himself.  Dewan confirmed the information in the \nad regarding both the job opportunity and the opportunity to obtain legal permanent residency \n(\"green card\")  in the United States.  Dewan told Sabu that upcoming informational meetings \n10 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 11 of 65\nwere going to be held at the Trident Hotel in Cochin, India and encouraged Sabu to attend if \nhe was interested in the opportunity. \n39.  Sabu attended several meetings at the Trident Hotel between November 2003 and \nJanuary  2004.  At each of these  meetings,  Sabu and  other hopeful  Indian workers were \npromised employment with a reputable U. S. company and a green card in exchange for the \npayment of approximately $8,250 in \"recruitment fees,\" to be paid in three installments of \n$2,750.  Sabu was also told at these meetings that he would need to take and pass a practical \nskills test. \n40.  Prior to the first installment payment, Dewan demanded that Sabu deliver $25,000 \nrupees (approximately $425) to Dewan's associate, \"Salimon,\" to apply for the position with \nthe U.S. company.  Relying on the promise of work in the United States and a green card, \nSabu made this payment on December 26, 2003.  Dewan confirmed receipt of this \"advance\" \npayment via facsimile. \n41.  On or about January 20 or 22, 2004, Sabu attended a meeting at the Trident Hotel \nwhere he made his first installment payment for $2,750.00 to Indo-Amerisoft.  Dewan also \ndemanded that Sabu pay to Dewan an additional 37,000 rupees (approximately $629) in cash. \nSabu made each of these payments believing that he  would be able to  recoup these  fees \nthrough the job opportunity in the United States and the  opportunity to  obtain permanent \nresidence in the United States. \n42.  At the January 2004 meeting, Burnett and Rao also were present.  Dewan acted as \nthe interpreter for Burnett and Rao.  Burnett and Rao re-confirmed the information Sabu had \npreviously received from Dewan regarding the job opportunity, green card application, and \nthe three installment payments. \n11 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 12 of 65\n43.  At  this  meeting,  Sabu  was  told  by  Dewan,  Rao  and  Burnett  that  the  job \nopportunity was with Indo-Amerisoft and that the Defendants were going to obtain the green \ncard on his behalf before he traveled to the United States to begin his employment.  As an \nattorney, Burnett's agreement to act on Sabu's behalf, coupled with payment from Sabu for \nsuch services,  established  an  attorney-client  relationship  between  Burnett  and  Sabu  and \nBurnett made no suggestions to the contrary. \n44.  Sabu was told that if he wanted to bring any family he would need to pay an \nadditional $1,700 \"family fee.\"  Sabu did so and made this payment to Dewan after securing a \nloan from a local community bank. \n45.  In order to make the first \"advance\" and installment payments, Sabu initially was \nforced  to  sell some of his  wife's gold jewelry.  Later,  he  used the remaining jewelry as \ncollateral for a loan with a 12% interest rate. \n46.  Sabu was told by Dewan, Burnett and Rao that it would only take six months to \nobtain the initial labor certification.  After hearing nothing for nine months, Sabu contacted \nDewan by telephone to check on the status of the certification.  Dewan assured him  that \neverything was in order and that he should not worry.  All the while, his loans were accruing \ninterest. \n47.  Almost two  years  after  Sabu made  the  initial  payments to  Dewan  and  Indo \nAmerisoft, Dewan contacted Sabu in early 2006 and told him that the labor certification had \nbeen  approved.  The  second  installment payment  was  tied  to  Indo-Amerisoft and  Rao's \nreceipt of the labor certificate.  In a letter dated January 26, 2006, and typewritten on Indo \nAmerisoft  letterhead,  Rao  and  Indo-Amerisoft  offered  a  $100  discount  on  the  second \ninstallment payment as a result of the delay. \n12 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 13 of 65\n48.  During  the  interim,  Sabu  had  obtained  steady  employment  as  a  pipefitter  in \nDubai.  In order to make the second installment payment, Sabu had to travel from Dubai to \nMumbai to make the payment.  In addition, Sabu was forced to take out another loan, this \ntime using the land and home owned by his in-laws as collateral. \n49.  In total, Sabu took out a loan for 3.5 lakh rupees (approximately $5,950) in order \nto make the installment payments for the recruitment fees. \n50.  On or about February  13, 2006  Sabu met with Dewan and Rao and made the \nsecond installment payment for  $2,650  to  Indo-Amerisoft.  At this time, he  also  paid  an \nadditional 62,000 rupees (approximately $1,054) directly to Dewan. \n51.  During these meetings, Rao, Burnett and Dewan promised Sabu that he would be \npaid $18.00 per hour (which would be increased after three months), that the job opportunity \nwas to work for Indo-Amerisoft, that Indo-Amerisoft would provide housing accommodations \nfor a small fee, and, most important to Sabu and the other Indian workers, that he would be \narriving  in the  United  States with a green card that  would  allow  him  to  live  and work \npermanently in the United States. \nPlaintijJ Thampy 's Initial Recruitment \n52.  In November of 2003,  while  on leave from  his job in Saudi  Arabia,  Plaintiff \nThampy saw an advertisement in an Indian newspaper from Dewan Consultants offering the \nopportunity  to  work  and  to  obtain  permanent  residency  in  the  United  States.  The \nadvertisement promised wages of $5,000 per month,  significantly more than Tharnpy was \nmaking at his current job for Aramco in Saudi Arabia.  Thampy contacted Dewan and an \ninitial meeting was set in December 2003. \n53.  On December 12, 2003, Thampy met Dewan and Dewan's associate, \"Salimon,\" \namong others.  Dewan explained that Thampy  would be making $22 per hour and would \n13 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 14 of 65\nreceive a green card within 18 months.  Dewan also told Thampy that with this visa, he would \nbe able to bring his family with him to the United States. \n54.  To complete the process, Dewan told Thampy that he would have to pay three \ninstallments of $2,750 to Indo-Amerisoft (or $8,250 total), plus three installments of 75,000 \nrupees to Dewan (approximately $5,160 total), for a combined cost of approximately $13,410. \nAdditionally, Thampy would have to pay 60,000 rupees (approximately $1,400) for airfare to \nthe United States.  In sum, the cost to Thampy would be approximately $14,800. \n55.  Dewan told Thampy that he should be ready for a subsequent meeting in January \nwhere he would be expected to pay the first installment.  To raise the funds to pay the first \ninstallment, Thampy took a loan from the Bank of Borada for 1.7 lakh rupees (approximately \n$3,900), using the title to his land as collateral, at a 9.5% per annum interest rate. \n56.  The meeting was held  on or about January  17,  2004, at the Trident Hotel  in \nCochin.  Dewan and Salimon were present, as well as Burnett and Rao.  Thampy paid his first \ninstallment of $2,750 to Indo-Amerisoft and 75,000 rupees to Dewan at this meeting.  After \nmaking  the  payment,  Burnett  informed  Thampy  that  the  green  card  process  would  be \ncomplete  within  18  months and that he  would be  in touch regarding  next  steps.  As  an \nattorney, Burnett's agreement to act on Thampy's behalf, coupled with payment from Thampy \nfor such services, established an attorney-client relationship between Burnett and Thampy and \nBurnett made no suggestions to the contrary. \n57.  Following the January meeting, in  February 2004, Thampy returned to his job \nwith Aramco in Saudi Arabia.  In the meantime, Thampy repeatedly followed-up with Dewan \nand Salimon to check on the progress of the green card effort.  He routinely was told that his \napplication was on the \"fast track.\"  Other than such reassurances, however, there was no \napparent progress. \n14 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 15 of 65\n58.  Over a year later, in  approximately June  of 2005,  Dewan contacted Thampy, \ninforming him that he had \"a position\" and that he should return to India (from Saudi Arabia) \nwithin two months.  Relying on this promise of employment, Thampy quit his job in Saudi \nArabia, and returned to India in July or August of 2005.  Upon his arrival, he immediately \ncontacted Dewan, who said that there was not, in fact, a job for Thampy at this time. \n59.  Without employment, Plaintiff Thampy was forced to  borrow funds to support \nhimself and his family.  Thampy was able to borrow 50,000 rupees (approximately $850) \nfrom a friend, but desperate for further funds, he borrowed 1.5 lakh rupees (approximately \n$2550) from a loan shark, known as a \"blade company,\" charging 10% interest per month. \nBlade  companies  are  different  from  conventional  banks,  operating  outside  the  law  and \nengaging in threatening and illegal debt collection practices.  Thampy worried that if he was \nunable to  repay the debt to  the  blade company that the  safety of his family  could be  in \njeopardy. \n60.  Faced with debts that he could not repay, and no real forthcoming employment \nfrom Dewan despite his promises, in October or November 2005 Thampy departed for Qatar \nwhere he was able to secure employment. \n61.  In  January  2006,  Dewan  contacted Thampy  and  informed  him  that his  labor \ncertification had been approved and that his second installment was now due: $2,750 to Indo \nAmerisoft and 75,000 rupees to Dewan.  Because Thampy was then working in Qatar, he sent \nhis  brother-in-law,  Varghese  Kannampally,  to  meet with  Dewan,  Burnett and  Rao  at the \nTrident Hotel on February 16, 2006 to pay the second Indo-Amerisoft installment of $2,750. \nRelying on his friendship with a manager at the Bank of Borado, Thampy borrowed 2 lakh \nrupees (approximately $3,400), at an interest rate of9% per annum, to pay Indo-Amerisoft. \nIS \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 16 of 65\n62.  At the meeting, Burnett and Rao told Thampy's brother-in-law that they were \nfiling the 1-140 forms and that Thampy would be going to the United States in 6-9 months. \nThis was confirmed to Thampy by Dewan in a subsequent telephone call.  Dewan also sought \nhis second installment of 75,000 rupees, which Thampy wired to Dewan's Dubai office from \nQatar, after borrowing the funds from friends. \nInitial Recruitment Allegations Common to Sabu and Thampy \n63.  Upon information and belief, prior to hosting meetings and testing sessions that \nincluded  Plaintiffs  Sabu  and  Thampy  and  others,  Indo-Amerisoft,  Rao  and  the  Agents \nconferred in late 2003 and early 2004 by phone, mail,  fax or e-mail to organize, plan, and \ncoordinate  the  logistics,  strategy  and  substantive  content  of these  meetings  and  testing \nsessions. \n64.  In  telephone  communications,  in-person  meetings,  faxes,  contracts,  and other \nwritten documents transmitted by mail and/or wire in the first half of 2004, Indo-Amerisoft, \nRao  and/or the  Agents  personally  and  through  employees,  agents  and/or associates,  told \nPlaintiffs Sabu and Thampy that if they successfully passed administered skills tests and paid \nfees  totaling approximately  5 to  8 lakh rupees (approximately  $12,000 to  $20,000), then \nPlaintiffs would be able to apply for legal permanent resident (green card) status in the United \nStates with Indo-Amerisoft and Rao. \n65.  In telephone communications, in-person meetings, faxes, written contracts, and/or \nother written communications, transmitted, upon information and belief, by mail and/or wire, \nIndo-Amerisoft, Rao and/or the Agents instructed Plaintiffs that the total fees would be paid in \na series of approximately three installments. \n66.  At informational meetings and in telephone conversations, faxes, contracts, and \nother written documents transmitted  in  late  2003  through  approximately mid-2004,  Indo-\n16 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 17 of 65\nAmerisoft, Rao and/or the Agents, personally and/or through their agents, representatives, \nand/or employees,  represented to  Plaintiffs that  Indo-Amerisoft and Rao  were stable  and \nreputable U.S. companies offering lawful and ample employment opportunities, and that Indo \nAmerisoft and Rao would obtain for Plaintiffs green cards enabling Plaintiffs to permanently \nand legally immigrate to the United States with their family members. \n67.  At informational meetings and in telephone conversations, faxes, contracts, and \nother written  documents  transmitted in late  2003  through approximately mid-2004,  Indo \nAmerisoft, Rao and/or the Agents, personally and/or through their agents, employees and/or \nrepresentatives,  told  Plaintiffs  that  the  green  card  process,  once  commenced,  would  be \ncompleted within 18 to 24 months. \n68.  In such communications with Plaintiffs, Indo-Amerisoft, Rao and/or the Agents \nfurther  promised to  act  diligently  and  do  everything necessary to  obtain green cards  for \nPlaintiffs in the timelines stipulated. \n69.  The written communications and other documents provided to Plaintiffs by Indo \nAmerisoft, Rao and/or the Agents through the use of mail and/or wire transmissions in and \naround early to mid-2004, further promised that Plaintiffs would promptly receive a refund of \nall or nearly all of their payments if Indo-Amerisoft, Rao and/or the Agents did not succeed in \nsecuring green cards for Plaintiffs as promised. \n70.  Indo-Amerisoft, Rao and/or the Agents knew or should have known that they \nwould not refund Plaintiffs' money as promised. \n71.  Indo-Amerisoft, Rao and/or the Agents induced Plaintiffs to  agree to pay them \nrecruitment and other fees, and incur additional related expenses, in exchange for the promise \nof work and legal residence in the United States without any intention to diligently pursue \nPlaintiffs' green card applications; knowingly misrepresented, inter alia, that the companies \n17 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 18 of 65\nand/or entities purportedly sponsoring Plaintiffs' applications were financially solvent and had \nreliable  and  stable  employment  opportunities  to  provide  Plaintiffs;  that  the  green  card \napplications  sponsored  by  such  companies  would  be  valid  and  bona  fide  under  U.S. \nimmigration law;  and that the applications  were  likely  to  be  successfully  completed  and \napproved within the promised timelines. \n72.  In reasonable reliance on the explicit and repeated promises of Indo-Amerisoft, \nRao and/or the Agents regarding green cards, family members'  ability to immigrate to the \nUnited  States,  and  lawful  and  legitimate  employment opportunities  in the  United  States, \nPlaintiffs undertook considerable economic, social, familial and personal sacrifices, including \npayment of high fees, assumption of significant interest bearing debt, loss of real and personal \nproperty, lost work opportunities, lost or unpaid wages, and addi tional legal fees. \n73.  When Plaintiffs  contacted  Dewan,  and/or  Indo-Amerisoft and Rao  by  phone, \nmail, or e-mail at various times between 2004 and mid-2006 to check on the progress of their \ngreen card applications, they were assured that the green card process was going forward. \n74.  While awaiting the processing of their green cards, Plaintiffs continued to accrue \nsubstantial interest on the funds that they had borrowed for the purpose of making the initial \ninstallment payments to Indo-Amerisoft, Rao and/or the Agents. \n75.  In or around January 2006, Indo-Amerisoft, Rao and/or the Agents, personally \nand/or through their agents, employees and/or representatives notified Plaintiffs via telephone, \ne-mail, or mail communications that the labor certification and paperwork required for their \ngreen card application had been approved by the U.S. government. \n76.  After this notification, Indo-Amerisoft, Rao and/or the Agents used wire and/or \nmail communications to collect the second installment payments from Plaintiffs. \n18 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 19 of 65\n77.  By spring 2006, after the 18 to 24 month processing period promised by Indo-\nAmerisoft,  Rao  and/or the  Agents  had  lapsed,  Plaintiffs had  still  not received their green \ncards. \n78.  Unbeknownst to Plaintiffs, at that time there actually were no job opportunities at \nan Indo-Amerisoft facility  anywhere in the United States,  despite Dewan's, Burnett's and \nRao's affirmative and repeated statements that the advertised opportunity for employment and \npermanent legal residence in the United States was with and through Indo-Amerisoft. \nIn the Aftermath ofH  urricane Katrina, Signal Joins the Fraudulent Enterprise \nand Contracts to Bring Workers to the United States. \n79.  After the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Signal was presented \nwith both an opportunity and a challenge.  The rebuilding effort offered significant potential \nfor new work fixing damaged oil rigs, ships, and other marine platforms.  At the same time, \nhowever, because the hurricane also destroyed or damaged thousands of homes along the Gulf \nCoast, including in Pascagoula, some of Signal's workforce had temporarily left the area. \n80.  In early 2006, Global approached Signal with a purported solution to its problem. \nAt a meeting in January or February of 2006, Global told Signal's Chief Financial Officer \nChris Cunningham, Senior Vice President and General Manager Ronald Schnoor, and Vice \nPresident of Productions for Mississippi Operations Bill Bingle, that it could deliver first-class \nfitters and welders from India at no cost to Signal.  Global informed Signal that it would work \nwith local  immigration attorney  Burnett and  India-based recruiter Dewan to  bring skilled \nlaborers from India.  The workers themselves would pay for all costs and fees associated with \nthe recruitment process, immigration processing, and travel to the United States, and Signal \nwould not reimburse the workers for these fees.  Signal would pay the workers between $14 \nand $18 per hour, depending upon skill level. \n19 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 20 of 65\n81.  On April  18, 2006, Signal formally joined the Defendants' scheme, executing a \ndocument entitled \"Skilled Worker Recruitment Agreement\" (the \"Recruitment Agreement\") \nwith Global, authorizing Global to recruit foreign skilled workers for employment at Signal \n\"under the 'H-2B' temporary program and/or the 'permanent residence' process.\" Pursuant to \nthe Recruitment Agreement, Global agreed to deliver the workers \"at no cost to Signal\" and \nfurther  agreed  that  all  other  charges,  expenses  and  fees  associated  with  recruitment, \ntransportation, and entry of the foreign workers into the United States would be paid by the \nworkers themselves or by Global, who in tum would be reimbursed through deductions from \nthe wages of Plaintiffs and other workers. \n82.  On  June  19,  2006,  Signal  executed  a  power  of attorney  appointing  Dewan \nConsultants as Signal's \"representative in India to facilitate the recruitment of skilled workers \nto the United States of America\" for employment at Signal.  The power of attorney authorized \nDewan Consultants to advertise,  conduct seminars and trade tests, and  sign any necessary \nlegal documentation on Signai's behalf. \n83.  Also  in mid-2006,  Signal  entered into  an  attorney-client relationship  with the \nBurnett Defendants to advise Signal on immigration issues pertaining to  Signal's need for \nworkers.  The Burnett Defendants never disclosed this conflict of interest to Plaintiffs.  Signal \nand  the  Burnett  Defendants  later  memorialized  their  engagement  in  a  written  retainer \nagreement.  Pursuant to that agreement, Signal would not be responsible for any of the Burnett \nDefendants' legal fees.  Rather, under the terms of the agreement, the Burnett Defendants took \nfunds  from  the  \"recruitment fees\"  charged  to  the  workers  to  pay  for  the  legal  services \nprovided to Signal. \n84.  Signal requested that the Agents secure foreign workers and transport them to the \nUnited  States  as  quickly  as  possible.  Signal  and  the  Agents  decided  that Signal  would \n20 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 21 of 65\nsponsor workers on H-2B visas, which could later be extended if Signal needed more foreign \nlabor. \n85.  In 2006, the Agents placed newspaper advertisements in at least six Indian cities \nto  recruit  workers  for  Signal.  Some  of the  advertisements  offered  welders  and  fitters \nopportunities  to  go  to  the  United  States  and  obtain  H-2B  visas  or green  cards.  Other \nadvertisements touted the opportunity for \"permanent lifetime settlement in U.S.A. for self \nand family.\" \n86.  In response to these advertisements, in or about April or May of 2006, Plaintiffs \nSabu and Thampy each contacted Dewan and Dewan Consultants by telephone, and attended \nmeetings and testing sessions organized by the Agents and their employees or representatives \nat locations throughout India. \nDefendants File Petitions for Temporary H-2B Visas, Not Green Cards \n87.  Defendants told  Plaintiffs that  Signal  would  sponsor them  immediately  for  a \ngreen card to induce them to continue in the scheme to pay large fees to travel to the United \nStates-which had the net effect of defraying nearly aU the costs Signal would have had to \nexpend to recruit workers legitimately-and to induce them to continue in the scheme to pay \nthe exorbitant \"recruitment fees\" far in excess of what would actuaUy be required to obtain H-\n2B visas or even the promised green cards. \n88.  Unbeknownst to the Plaintiffs, however,  Defendants never filed nor otherwise \nsupported green  card  applications for  Plaintiffs,  or  took  any  other steps toward assisting \nPlaintiffs with  securing  a  green  card,  and  Signal  told  the  United  States  Department  of \nHomeland Security under penalty of perjury that Signal's need for workers was temporary. \n89.  Written agreements between Plaintiffs, Indo-Amerisoft, Rao and/or the Agents \nalso explicitly promised assistance in applying for and securing a green card-assistance that \n21 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 22 of 65\nDefendants took no steps toward providing.  Dewan Consultants had the workers, including \nPlaintiffs,  sign \"memoranda of understanding,\"  which,  among other things,  informed the \nworkers  that  \"Signal  International,  LLC  has  orally  promised  the  Facilitator  [Dewan \nConsultants] ... that ... [Signal] will be willing to file and process their employment base \n[sic.] Green Card.\"  Dewan Consultants also issued form letters to the workers once they were \nselected to travel to Signal, informing the workers that Signal \"shall proceed with your Green \nCard for United States of America.\" \n90.  Several  Signal  employees,  including  Signal  Special  Projects  Manager  John \nSanders  and  Vice-president  of Productions  for  Mississippi  Operations  William  Bingle, \ntraveled  to  India  and  attended  these  sessions.  Sanders  also  oversaw  the  immigration \ninterviews and served as contact between Signal and consular officials. \n9 1.  To ensure that their deception remained hidden, Defendants instructed Plaintiffs \nnot to tell United States Department of Homeland Security officials during their forthcoming \nH-2B visa interview that,  in addition to applying for  temporary worker status, Signal had \npromised them that it would sponsor them for a green card.  As Michael Pol explained to \nSanders in an August 24, 2006 email: \nMal[vern Burnett],  Sachin  [Dewan]  or I[  ]  needs  to  be  with  each  and  every \ncandidate  going  into  the  consulates  before  their  interview  [because]  [t ]hey \nsometimes say the dumbest things and need to be coached on the proper way to \ninterview. . .. [T]here are some things that should not be known to the consulate \npersonnel, such as the fact that we are going to process them for a green card.  If \none of those guys says he is  going to  the U.S.  for immigration and Signal is \nsponsoring him for permanent residence (green card) ... he is a goner. \n92.  In late May and early June of 2006, the Burnett Defendants, on behalf of Signal, \nfiled  with  the  Mississippi  Department  of  Employment  Security,  the  Texas  Workforce \nCommission, and the United States Department of Labor by mail, electronic transmission, \nand/or fax the completed forms ETA 750 and attachments seeking permission to import and \n22 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 23 of 65\nhire  590  foreign  guestworkers  to  work  for  Signal  under  the  auspices  of 8  U.S.C.  § \n1 I 01(a)(l5)(H)(ii)(b), attendant regulations 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(6) and 20 C.F.R. § 655.3, and \nassociated  administrative  letters  and/or  guidance  (commonly  known  as  \"the  H-2B \nguestworker program\"). \n93.  Knowing that Signal's labor need was projected to be at least two to three years, \nSignal  and  the  Burnett  Defendants  stated  in  these  applications  to  the  state  workforce \ncommissions and forms ETA 750 that Signal would employ workers from October I, 2006, to \nJuly  31,  2007.  These  applications  were  furnished  with  signatures  by  Signal  executives \nswearing, under penalty of perjury, to the veracity of the information in these applications. \n94.  The  H-2B  guestworker  program  permits  U.S.  employers  to  import  foreign \nworkers on short-term temporary visas to meet labor needs when employers attest that they \ncannot find U.S. workers to perform the available jobs. \n95.  H-2B visas are non-immigrant visas, are  only valid for work with the specific \nemployer listed on the visa, and do  not provide portable  and/or transferable employment \nauthorization for the visa bearer. \n96.  Defendant  Signal  stated  in  the  ETA  750  forms  that  its  need  for  H-2B \nguestworkers was \"peak load and a one-time occurrence\" and that \"the temporary workers \nwill work for the length of the prescribed dates of need, will be paid in accordance with the \nprevailing wage, and will return to their home country at the end of employment.\" \n97.  In the ETA 750 forms,  Defendant Signal named the Burnett Defendants as its \nagents  for  the  purposes  of preparing  and  submitting  these  applications  to  import  H-2B \nguestworkers.  The Burnett Defendants prepared and submitted these applications on behalf of \nSignal. \n23 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 24 of 65\n98.  At the time of filing the ETA 750 fonns and attachments with the Mississippi \nDepartment of Employment  Security,  the  Texas  Workforce  Commission,  and  the  United \nStates Department of Labor, Signal and the Burnett Defendants knew that Signal projected the \nlabor need that it sought to fill with foreign workers to be at least two to three years. \n99.  Signal and the Burnett Defendants, at or around the time they filed the ETA 750 \nfonns in May and June 2006, repeatedly communicated by telephone, mail, e-mail, and/or fax \nto  direct  and  coordinate  recruitment  of  Indian  workers  to  fill  the  anticipated  H-2B \nguestworker  jobs.  Upon  infonnation  and  belief,  Signal  and/or  the  Burnett  Defendants \nrepeatedly communicated with Dewan, Dewan Consultants, Global, Indo-Amerisoft and Rao \nby telephone, mail, e-mail, and/or fax to direct and coordinate recruitment of Indian workers \nto fill the anticipated H-2B guestworker jobs. \n100. Upon infonnation and belief, in the course of telephone, fax, e-mail and/or mail \ncommunications  occurring  in or around  Mayor June  2006,  Defendant  Signal authorized \nDewan, Dewan Consultants, and Global to act as their agents in India and the United Arab \nEmirates for the purposes of recruiting Indian welders and fitters to fill the anticipated H-2B \nguestworker jobs at Signal operations. \n101. Upon infonnation and belief, in the course of these communications, Defendant \nSignal further authorized Dewan, Dewan Consultants, Global, and the Burnett Defendants to \nrepresent that Signal would assume sponsorship of the pending and as-yet-unsuccessful green \ncard applications on behalf of Plaintiffs and other Indian workers. \n102. Upon infonnation and belief, in the course of these communications, Defendant \nSignal further authorized Dewan, Dewan Consultants, Global, and the Burnett Defendants to \nrepresent that Signal would apply for at least two to three H-2B visa extensions on behalf of \n24 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 25 of 65\nall the Indian H-2B workers, including Plaintiffs, to allow them to remain in the United States \nworking for Signal while the green card applications were being processed. \n103. Signal authorized its Agents to make these representations even though it knew or \nhad reason to know that such visa extensions and green card applications would not be bona \nfide and valid under United States immigration law.  Moreover, Signal authorized its Agents \nto make these misrepresentations even though it did not have the intention at that time to \napply for such visa extensions and/or green cards on behalf of all of the Indian H-2B workers, \nincluding Plaintiffs. \n104. In July and August of 2006, the Burnett Defendants, on behalf of Signal, filed \nwith the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service by mail, electronic transmission, \nand/or fax the completed 1-129 forms and attachments seeking 590 H-2B visas for Plaintiffs, \namong others. \n105. Despite knowing that Signal's labor need was projected to be at least two to three \nyears, in these H-2B visa applications Signal attested to a 10-month labor need running from \nOctober 1, 2006, to July 31, 2007.  Signal falsely represented to the government that at the \nend of this 10 month period, it intended to return all H-2B beneficiaries, including Plaintiffs, \nback to  India.  The Burnett  Defendants declared  that the  applications  were  all  based on \ninformation  of which  the  Burnett  Defendants  had  knowledge,  even  though  the  Burnett \nDefendants believed that Signal's intentions for these workers, including Plaintiffs, exceeded \nten months. \n106. In these communications, the Agents falsely assured Plaintiffs that Signal would \nseek at least two extensions of the temporary H-2B visa with which Plaintiffs would gain \nadmittance to the United States, and that Plaintiffs' H-2B visa would thereafter be converted \nto a permanent green card. \n25 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 26 of 65\n107. Upon information and belief, Defendants communicated and consulted frequently \nvia mail, fax, e-mail and/or telephone communications regarding the issues to be discussed \nand representations to be made to the worker recruits, including Plaintiffs. \n108. In their  communications with Plaintiffs,  the  Agents  further failed  to  disclose \nmaterial facts  regarding  the  H-2B  visa,  including  the  fact  that H-2B  visas  confer only  a \ntemporary  non-immigrant  status  that  does  not  allow  the  bearer  to  adjust  to  permanent \nresidency status and the fact that applying for H-2B visa status is fundamentally incompatible \nwith simultaneously applying for a green card. \n109. Plaintiffs, unaware of U.S.  immigration law and the temporary,  nonimmigrant \ncharacter of H-2B visas and desperate not to forfeit the substantial fees they had already paid, \nagreed,  in reliance  on the  representations  of Indo-Amerisoft,  Rao  and/or  the  Agents,  to \ntransfer their  green  card  applications  from  Indo-Amerisoft's  to  Signal's  sponsorship  and \nfurther agreed to work for Signal under an H-2B visa pursuant to the terms explained by these \nDefendants. \n110. In reasonable reliance on the representations of Defendants, Plaintiffs entered the \nUnited States on an H-2B guest worker visas on November 28, 2006, for the purposes of \nworking for Signal at its Pascagoula, Mississippi facility. \n111. Plaintiffs would not have paid the extraordinary fees (or incurred such crushingly \nhigh,  and  in  some  instances,  usurious  interest)  charged  by  Dewan,  Dewan  Consultants, \nGlobal, Pol, the Burnett Defendants, Indo-Amerisoft, and Rao for travel, a green card, visa, \nand work opportunities, had they known that these Defendants' promises and representations \nwere false. \n112. Plaintiffs would not have paid the extraordinary fees charged by Indo-Amerisoft, \nRao and/or the Agents for travel, a green card, visa, and employment opportunities, had they \n26 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 27 of 65\nknown that these Defendants had failed to disclose material facts concerning the nature and \nterms and conditions of the immigration and work opportunities offered. \nPreparations and Departure for the United States \n113.At  various  times  during  the  spring,  summer,  and  fall  2006,  employees  of \nDefendant Signal traveled to various locations in India and the United Arab Emirates and \ntested the worker recruits', including Plaintiffs' welding and pipefitting skills, in anticipation \nof employing them in the United States. \n114. Plaintiffs  paid  costs  necessary  to  travel  to  the  cities  where  these  tests  were \nadministered. \n115. Plaintiffs paid admission fees charged to take these tests. \n116. Plaintiffs attended and passed these tests, which were overseen and graded by \nDefendant Signal's and/or Defendant Dewan's agents, employees, and/or representatives. \n117. Upon  information  and  belief,  prior  to  attending  these  meetings  and  testing \nsessions, Defendants Signal, Dewan, Dewan Consultants, Global, and the Burnett Defendants \nconferred in spring, summer, and fall 2006 by phone, mail, fax and or e-mail to organize, \nplan, and coordinate the logistics and substantive content of these testing sessions. \n118. On or about July 20, 2006 and August 17, 2006, the United States Department of \nLabor approved Signal's labor certification applications for 590 H-2B workers for the period \nof October 1, 2006 through July 31, 2007. \n119.In approving these labor certification applications, the United States Department \nof Labor relied on the accuracy of the applications' stated 1O  -month period of labor need. \n120. Upon information and belief, the Department of Labor is prohibited by its internal \nguidelines  to  grant  labor  certification  applications  without  relying  on  the  application's \nstatement of temporary labor need. \n27 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 28 of 65\n12l.In late  August and  early  September 2006,  the  United  States  Citizenship  and \nImmigration Service approved Signal's H-2B visa petitions for 590 H-2B workers, including \nPlaintiffs, for the period of October 1, 2006 through July 31, 2007. \n122. In approving these visa petitions, the United States Citizenship and Immigration \nService relied on the accuracy of the petitions' stated 10-month period of labor need and the \nrepresentation that Signal's need was based on a one time peak-load temporary demand. \n123. The  United  States  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Service  must,  according  to \nregulation,  rely  on  the  stated  period  of  the  petitioner's  labor  need.  See \n8 C.F.R.214.2(h)(6)(ii)(B) (2006). \n124. Defendants knew that the stated period of need in Signal's applications for labor \ncertifications and for H-2B visas were inconsistent with Signal's projected actual labor need \nand therefore Defendants knew these statements to the government were false. \n125. Defendants used the H-2B visas, obtained from the U.S. Government on the basis \nof false  statements by  Signal and the Burnett Defendants, to elicit payments of the third \ninstallment from Plaintiffs and other Indian workers. \n126. Plaintiffs entered the United States on an H-2B guestworker visa, issued by the \nU.S. Government on the basis of false statements by Signal and the Burnett Defendants, on \nNovember 28, 2006, for the purposes of working for Signal at its Pascagoula facility. \n127.Around the time of United States Citizenship and  Immigration Service's visa \napproval, Plaintiffs made necessary preparations to travel to the United States on an H-2B visa \nto work for Signal, including: paying to obtain necessary travel and legal documents; making \npayments to the United States consulate, Dewan, Dewan Consultants, Global, Pol, Burnett, \nIndo-Amerisoft and Rao for mandatory H-2B visa and consular processing fees; attending H-\n28 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 29 of 65\n2B  visa  interviews;  and  paying  Dewan,  Dewan  Consultants,  Global  and  Pol  for  travel \narrangements. \n128. In order to secure an H-2B visa to work for Signal, Plaintiffs were required to be \ninterviewed by the United States Consular offices. \n129. This consular interview required that Plaintiffs pay the costs of travel from their \nhome or current place of employment to Madras (Chennai). \n130. Defendants required that Plaintiffs sign documents permitting Dewan to receive \ntheir visa-stamped passport from the Consulate on Plaintiffs' behalf. \n131. During  Plaintiffs'  consular  interviews,  the  consular  officials  took  Plaintiffs' \npassports from them. \n132. Once Plaintiffs' visas were approved, consular officials sent the passports with \nH-2B visa affixed, directly to Dewan. \n133. Before  Plaintiffs  could  leave  for  the  United  States,  however,  Plaintiffs were \nrequired to attend final  meetings in  Dewan's Mumbai (Bombay) office to make the third \ninstallment payments. \n134. The meeting took place mere hours before Plaintiffs' scheduled departure to the \nUnited States. \n135. At these meetings, Dewan, Dewan Consultants, Global, Pol and Burnett collected \nthe final installment payment. \n136. Dewan, Dewan Consultants, Global, Pol and Burnett also required that Plaintiffs, \nwho did not proficiently read or speak English, sign English language documents with little or \nno time for review. \n29 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 30 of 65\n137. Dewan  refused  to  return  Plaintiffs'  passports-which  had  been  in  Dewan's \npossession since after Plaintiffs' H-2B visas were approved by Consular Officials-until after \nPlaintiffs had paid the final installments and signed the mandatory paperwork. \n138. Notably,  it  was  only  at  this  time  that  Plaintiffs  learned that  they  would  be \ntravelling on a temporary, H-2B visa and not with the promised green card.  When Plaintiff \nSabu questioned Dewan about this discrepancy, Dewan assured him that Signal was working \nto process their green cards and that, in any event, the H-2B visa could be extended twice. \nDewan had also assured Plaintiff Thampy that Signal was working to  process their green \ncards. \n139. Highly indebted and scared for their family's livelihood if they did not proceed \nwith the job at Signal's operations, Plaintiffs grudgingly went along with this change in the \nimmigration status on the premise that, as promised by Dewan and Burnett, Signal was indeed \nmoving forward and working towards securing the promised green cards. \n140. On November 22, 2006 Sabu made the final installment payment for $2,750.00 \njust hours before getting on a plane to come to the United States.  Sabu was also required to \npay $740 directly to Burnett and $2,490 directly to Pol (in addition to the third installment \npayment).  In order to make these final payments, Sabu had to take out an additional loan at \nan interest rate that exceeded 12% per annum. \n141. Plaintiff Thampy similarly was required to make the third installment payment of \n$2,750  just  hours  before  departing  to  the  United  States  and  forced  to  sign  numerous \ndocuments written in English which were  never translated or whose  contents were never \nexplained to him. \n30 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 31 of 65\n142. In forceful tones, Dewan, Dewan Consultants, Global, Pol, Burnett or their staff \ndemanded that Plaintiffs quickly sign the mandatory documents, lest they miss the flights to \nthe United States. \n143. Plaintiffs  had  no  reasonable  opportunity  to  reVIew,  negotiate,  or  make  any \nchanges to the documents presented them. \n144. Pursuant to Defendant Signal's instructions and arrangements, approximately 300 \nworkers, including Plaintiffs, were sent to Signal's Pascagoula facility  upon arrival in the \nUnited States. \n145. Plaintiffs had no choice but to pay the fees that Defendants charged to secure \nemployment at Signal's operations. \nConditions at the Signal Facilities in Pascagoula \n146. Upon  arrival  at  Defendant  Signal's  facilities  in  Pascagoula,  Plaintiffs  were \nshocked to discover that they were expected to live in an isolated, overcrowded labor camp \ncomprised of trailer-like bunkhouses. \n147. Defendant Signal's labor camps were located in isolated, industrial areas miles \nremoved from shopping areas, places of worship, and residential communities.  These \"man \ncamps\" were enclosed by fences and accessible only by a single guarded entrance. \n148. The labor camp gates were constantly monitored by security guards retained by \nDefendant Signal.  Upon information and belief, some or all of these guards may have been \nobtained by Signal through the Swetman Security Company. \n149. Signal's security guards monitored Plaintiffs' comings and goings by requiring \nthem to show their employee identification badge and recording when Plaintiffs entered and \nexited the camp.  Signal's security guards also searched Plaintiffs' packages and bags when \nthey entered the camp. \n31 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 32 of 65\n150. Except on rare occasions, Plaintiffs were not permitted to receive visitors in the \nlabor camp. \nlSI. Up to twenty-four men were housed in each bunkhouse and made to sleep in two \ntiered bunk beds.  The bunk beds were so tightly packed in the bunkhouses that it was difficult \nfor Plaintiffs to move about in the narrow passageways between bunks. \n152. The  Signal  labor  camp  bunkhouses  had  insufficient  toileting  and  bathing \nfacilities for twenty-four men, resulting in long lines for the bathrooms before and after work \nshifts. \n153. Privacy  was  non-existent,  and  Plaintiffs often experienced  extreme  difficulty \nsleeping due to  the constant noise resulting from  the close quarters and the comings and \ngoings of workers who worked on different shifts. \n154. Defendant Signal's personnel and/or security guards conducted surprise searches \nof the  dormitory  areas  of the  bunkhouses,  including  searches  of  Plaintiffs'  personal \nbelongings. \nISS. Plaintiffs ate  meals  in  Defendant Signal's mess  halls,  which were  only  open \nduring  limited  hours.  Due  to  unhygienic  kitchen  conditions  and  rotten  food,  workers \nfrequently became ill, sometimes requiring hospitalization. \n156. Upon information and belief, neither Defendant Signal nor Global obtained the \nrequired  permit(s)  to  furnish  the  board  at  the  Mississippi  camp,  and  the  condition  and \nsanitation of the board further violated federal, state, and/or local law including, inter alia, the \nU.S.  Food and  Drug Administration Food Code, as  adopted and modified by  Mississippi \nDepartment of Health Food Regulations. \n157. To  add  further  insult  to  these  unsanitary  conditions,  Defendants  Signal  and \nGlobal  deducted  labor  camp  fees  of approximately  $35  per  day  ($245  per  week,  or \n32 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 33 of 65\napproximately $1,050 per month) from Plaintiffs' paychecks for these  accommodations and \nmeals. \n158. When workers complained and asked to live outside the labor camps, Defendant \nSignal initially refused and subsequently told workers that if they tried to live outside the \ncamps it still would  deduct the  labor camp  fees  from  their wages.  As  a result of these \neconomic  realities  (combined  with  the  loans  already  taken  out  by  Plaintiffs),  Plaintiffs \nreasonably felt that they had no choice but to continue living in the Signal camps. \n159. Within  a  few  days  of Plaintiffs'  and  other  Indian  H-2B  workers'  arrival  at \nSignal's labor camps on November 28, 2006, Signal personnel had conducted meetings at the \nlabor camps between Plaintiffs and representatives from specific banks.  In Pascagoula, these \nmeetings were with representatives from M & M Bank. \n160. At  the  instruction  of Defendant  Signal,  Plaintiffs  opened  accounts  with  the \ndesignated bank and agreed to directly deposit their wages into these accounts.  Defendant \nSignal's establishment of Plaintiffs'  accounts with this bank gave  it unique access to  and \ncontrol over Plaintiffs' funds. \n161. Signal employees, management and executives supervising the Pascagoula camp \nreferred  to  the  facility-privately  and  in  professional  correspondence  to  other  Signal \nemployees-as \"the Reservation,\" a term adopted from Signal's \"shipyard folks.\"  Another \nSignal employee was more direct, promising Signal management on April 5, 2007, that if he \nwere placed in charge of the camp, he would not give in to the \"misguided notion that some of \nthese  Indians can be  reasoned with\" but would instead \"most defiantly  [sic]  go  on a 'rat \nhunt. '\" \n33 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 34 of 65\n162. Defendant Signal only housed Indian H-2B workers such as Plaintiffs in its labor \ncamps.  Upon infonnation and belief, workers of non-Indian descent were neither required nor \nallowed to live in and/or pay for accommodations in Defendant Signal's labor camps. \n163. Defendant  Signal  subjected  Indian  H-2B  workers  such  as  Plaintiffs  to  skills \ntesting  and re-testing,  on-the-job discipline,  layoffs,  periods without work,  lack  of safety \nprecautions,  unfavorable  job  assignments,  evaluation  processes,  and  other  adverse \nemployment  actions  to  which  non-Indian  and  U.S.  citizen  workers  were  not  similarly \nsubjected. \n164. In addition,  Signal camp personnel  and  supervisors frequently  used offensive \nlanguage in speaking with and/or referring to Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers and \nregularly insulted Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers on the basis of their race, national \norigin, and/or alienage. \n165. During the first  week of employing Plaintiffs in  the United States, Defendant \nSignal did not reimburse  Plaintiffs for any of the expenses that Plaintiffs were required to \nincur as a pre-condition of seeking employment with Signal. \n166. During the first two weeks of employing Plaintiffs, Defendant Signal deducted \napproximately $100 to $200 each week from Plaintiffs' checks for job-related tool kits. \n167. Conditions were so poor at Signal's Pascagoula facility that, within one month of \nbeing at the camp, Plaintiff Thampy complained to the camp manager, John Sanders, about \nthe  \"jail-like\" conditions  of the  accommodations.  Plaintiff Sabu  similarly complained to \nSignal staff about the poor and rotten food and the deplorable living conditions.  Despite the \nsupport of several additional workers, their pleas were ignored. \n34 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 35 of 65\n168. Signal personnel and management regularly threatened Plaintiffs and other H-2B \nworkers that ifthey did not continue working for Signal, or did not work according to Signal's \nspecifications, Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers would be deported back to India. \n169. Unable  to  earn  enough to re-pay the  loans  they  had assumed  in their home \ncountry, returning to India at that time was simply not an option.  In the isolated and guarded \natmosphere of the labor camps and grappling with the crushing debt they had incurred to \ncome to the United States, Plaintiffs reasonably felt that Signal's statements were threatening \nand felt forced to continue working for Signal despite terrible working and Jiving conditions. \nPlaintiffs were thus subject to a state of economic extortion and imprisonment occasioned by \nDefendants' collective actions.  Leaving meant no job, no way to pay loans undertaken by \nthemselves and family  members, the forfeit of theirs and family  members' collateral,  and \npotential exposure to severe personal injury for themselves or family members at the hands of \nthe \"blade\" companies in India.  They had no choice but to incur the insults, racial slurs, \nanimal-like  treatment,  horrible  working  conditions,  inhumane  environment,  and  severe \nemotional distress occasioned by the concerted actions of Defendants.  They stayed, clinging \nto the repeated promises of a green card, believing that to be the only way out. \n170. At regular meetings and in one-on-one or small group conversations with Signal \ncamp  personnel  and  management,  some  workers  voiced  complaints  regarding  the \ndiscriminatory treatment to which Indian H-2B workers were subject. \n171. When Indian workers  voiced grievances  regarding  housing,  food,  and  wages, \nDefendant Signal's personnel warned them to stop complaining. \n172. When Signal took no action in response to workers' complaints, numerous Indian \nH-2B workers living at the Pascagoula labor camp began meeting collectively to discuss how \n35 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 36 of 65\nto persuade Signal to improve conditions in its labor camps, and also began meeting with third \nparties to discuss how best to address their concerns. \n173. Defendant Signal became aware of these meetings, including meetings between \nworkers and third parties whom Signal believed to be attorneys. \n174. Defendant Signal, through its employees and/or agents, contacted the Agents to \nexpress its concerns about worker organizing efforts. \n175. Upon information and belief, during these conversations Defendants reached an \nagreement regarding  steps that they  would  take to  discourage  further  worker organizing \nefforts and to ensure that the majority of the Indian H-2B workforce continued to work at \nSignal without complaint, as wen as to prevent the Indian H-2B workforce from exercising \ntheir legal rights. \n176. Upon information and belief, Signal management and camp personnel conferred \nand plotted internally and with the private Swetman Security firm to respond to workers' \norganizing  activities  and  to  take  actions  to  ensure that  the  majority  of the  Indian  H-2B \nworkforce continued to work at Signal without complaint, as well as to prevent the Indian H-\n2B workforce from exercising their legal rights. \n177.  On or about March 7, 2007, Dewan caned one worker's wife at her home in India \nand warned her that her husband, Sabulal Vijayan, must stop making trouble at Signal. \n178. Vijayan's wife informed him of this can, and Vijayan called Dewan on or about \nMarch 8, 2007.  During that conversation, Dewan told Vijayan that Dewan had learned from \nDefendant Signal that Vijayan was organizing the workers and making trouble.  Dewan told \nVijayan that all the workers would be sent back to India if the organizing continued. \n36 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 37 of 65\n179. Vijayan infonned other Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, about the calls his \nwife had received from Defendant Dewan, and word spread quickly through the Pascagoula \ncamps regarding the threats against Vijayan. \n180. News  about  the  calls  between  Defendant  Dewan,  Vijayan  and  his  wife \nsubstantially heightened the reasonable fears  of Plaintiffs that if they complained about or \ntried to leave the discriminatory and substandard working and living conditions at Signal, \nDefendants would retaliate against Plaintiffs or their families  with acts of violence,  or by \narranging for Plaintiffs' deportation to India . \n. 181. Defendant Signal called a workforce-wide meeting on or about March 8, 2007 in \nthe Pascagoula camp, attended by Signal management and Defendant Burnett. \n182. At this meeting, Signal management told Plaintiffs and other H-2B workers that \nSignal would fight back against organizing efforts by the workers. \n183. Signal management further threatened that Signal would not extend Plaintiffs' and \nall other Indian H-2B workers' visas ifany of the workers took legal action against Signal.  At \nthat same meeting, Defendant Burnett told the workers that they  were ineligible for  other \nkinds  of immigration  relief  and  could  depend  only  on  Signal  to  maintain  their  H-2B \nimmigration status and pursue their green card applications. \n184. At or about the  same  time  as  this  camp-wide meeting  in  Pascagoula,  Signal \nmanagement made the  decision to tenninate and  forcibly  deport Vijayan,  and three other \nIndian workers who had become the \"spokesmen\" for the Indian H-2B workers at the camp, \nand to do so by means that would make an example of them for the other Indian workers, \nincluding Plaintiffs, in order to keep the remaining workers in line. \n185. Early on the morning of March 9, 2007, Signal locked the gate to the Pascagoula \nlabor camp, thereby obstructing the sole means of direct entry to and exit from the camp. \n37 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 38 of 65\n186. Around  this  same  time,  Signal  camp  coordinator  Darrell  Snyder,  and \napproximately five security guards, some or all of whom were obtained through the private \nSwetman Security  firm,  swept through the  bunkhouses  carrying  pictures  of the  four  (4) \nworkers who were to be forcibly deported to India. \n187. Security guards began accosting workers to  determine whether they were the \nindividuals shown in the pictures. \n188. Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers became increasingly frightened and \nconfused by these activities, particularly when word spread that Signal had locked the gate \nthat served as the sole exit from the labor camp. \n189. Around 5:15 AM that morning, Vijayan was walking towards the dining area.  A \nsecurity guard and Darrell Snyder, a Signal employee, aggressively confronted Vijayan and \ninstructed him that he was in their custody. \n190. Based on the threats made at the meeting on March 8, 2007 and Vijayan's recent \nphone call with Dewan, Vijayan feared  what Defendant Signal might do to  him.  These \nfeelings, combined with Vijayan's reasonable fear that Snyder and the security guards might \nphysically hurt him, drove Vijayan to attempt suicide.  Plaintiff Thampy assisted Vijayan into \na vehicle that transported him from the labor camp to a local hospital for immediate medical \nattention. \n191. Other workers were kept under guard in the communal \"TV room\" and prevented \nfrom leaving.  These workers also were threatened with termination and deportation to India. \nThese workers were detained in the TV room, under guard, from approximately 6 a.m. for \nseveral hours. \n38 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 39 of 65\n192. Several security guards watched over these workers while they were detained. \nOver the course of several hours, security guards denied these workers' repeated requests to \nbe let out of the TV room, to get something to drink, or to use the bathroom. \n193. When other workers attempted to come into the TV room to talk to the three \nworkers kept inside, the security guards pushed them back. \n194. Confused and frightened, workers assembled outside the TV room to protest the \ntreatment of the workers detained therein. \n195. Around noon,  Darrell  Snyder and a Pascagoula police officer entered the TV \nroom and the officer questioned why the detained workers were there.  Snyder said that these \nworkers had been fired and would be sent back to India. \n196.By early afternoon on March 9, 2007, local media, religious advocates, and other \nindividuals had gathered outside the camp gate to express their concern over the attempted \nsuicide of Vijayan and the forced detention of thee other workers. \n197. Defendant Signal's actions on and after March 9, 2007 significantly intensified \nthe reasonable fears of Plaintiffs that if they tried to  leave Signal's employ or oppose the \nunlawful and coercive employment conditions at Signal, including by consulting with counsel, \nthey faced the threat of physical restraint, detention, forced deportation, or other serious harms \nand/or abuses of the legal process. \n198. Signal used this horrifying incident to  its advantage.  In a meeting with the \nworkers days after the attempted suicide, Signal told them that if any of the Signal workers \nfiled a lawsuit against Signal, Signal would send all of the workers back to India  Plaintiffs \nunderstood this to mean that they must remain quiescent and work, lest Signal retaliate and \nruin them financially. \n39 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 40 of 65\n199.Having witnessed the events of March 9, 2007, Plaintiffs reasonably feared that \nthey would suffer serious harm, physical restraint, and abuse of legal process if they were to \nleave Signal's employ.  Deeply indebted, fearful, isolated, disoriented, and unfamiliar with \ntheir rights under United States law, Plaintiffs felt compelled to continue working for Signal. \n200. Throughout the spring and summer of 2007, Signal personnel in the Mississippi \ncamp held various meetings with the remaining Indian H-2B workers, including Plaintiffs, to \ndiscuss the status of their visas and green card applications. \n201. Upon information and belief, during spring and summer 2007 Signal personnel \nconferred with their co-Defendants  and  co-conspirators  via phone andlor e-mail  to  reach \nagreement on what should be said to workers attending the meetings. \n202. Soon  after  March  9,  2007,  Defendant  Signal  held  a  camp-wide  meeting  in \nPascagoula.  Signal personnel told the Indian H-2B workers that Signal would sponsor their \ngreen cards ifthey stayed at Signal and obeyed Signal's rules, and warned that if workers held \nany meetings against Signal's interests, they would be terminated. \n203. During that same time period, Defendants Dewan and Burnett came to the Signal \ncamp  and  again  promised,  in  the  presence  of Signal  personnel,  that  Signal,  through  its \nattorney Burnett, would make bona fide applications for green cards and obtain several H-2B \nvisa  extensions  for  the  Indian  H-2B  workers  who  had  not  been  terminated  by  Signal. \nPlaintiffs reasonably believed these promises. \n204. In  meetings and conversations in spring and  summer 2007,  Defendant Signal, \nthrough its agents and employees at the Pascagoula facility, continued to promise that Signal \nwould arrange for the H-2B visa extensions and green cards originally promised to Plaintiffs \nwhen they were recruited in India. \n40 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 41 of 65\n205. Plaintiffs'  continuing  dependence  on  Signal  for  their  present  and  future \nimmigration status their continuing high levels of indebtedness and unfamiliarity with United \nStates law, reasonably led Plaintiffs to fear serious harm and/or abuse of the legal process if \nthey left Signal's employ. \n206. Under such circumstances, Plaintiffs reasonably felt like they had no choice but to \ncontinue working for Signal. \n207. At  various  times  relevant  to  Plaintiffs'  claims,  Defendant  Signal  refused  to \nconfirm whether valid H-2B visa extensions had in fact been obtained for Plaintiffs, coercing \nPlaintiffs to continue working for Signal in the hope that Signal would finally resolve their \nuncertain immigration status. \n208. After  working  for  Signal  for  almost  one  year  and  not  having  received  the \npromised green card, Plaintiff Sabu and other Indian workers contacted Rao regarding their \nimmigration  status.  In  late  2007,  Sabu  and  other workers  met with Rao' s wife  and  an \nattorney, Kristie L.  Bowerman, at a Super 8 Motel in Pascagoula.  Sabu was told at this \nmeeting that Rao would continue to help the workers with the processing of their green cards \nand 1-140 applications, but that they would need to pay additional monies to Rao and to the \nattorney for this work. \n209. Plaintiff Sabu paid an  additional $2,200 to  the  \"Immigration Nationality Law \nGroup\" based on the representations made by Rao.  On or about February 19, 2008, Rao \ninstructed Sabu to meet him at a Wal-Mart in Pascagoula and deliver an additional $400.  Rao \nrepresented to  Sabu that this  was  another payment  needed to  process  his  visa and  1-140 \napplication.  Sabu, feeling helpless and deeply in debt, made each of these payments based on \nthe misrepresentations of Rao and the other Defendants that this was the only way he could \nremain and work in the United States. \n41 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 42 of 65\n210. After nearly  a year enduring the horrid conditions  in  the Pascagoula facility, \nPlaintiff Thampy ultimately realized that Defendants' promises of permanent residency were \nillusory.  Afraid  that  company managers  would  deport  him  if they  knew  his  intentions, \nPlaintiff Thampy escaped the Pascagoula camp on October 7,2007, with the assistance of his \nfellow workers. \n211. Plaintiff Sabu,  however,  feeling  crushed under the weight of massive  debt in \nIndia, felt compelled to  continue working for  Sigoal until he was terminated in December \n2008.  At that time, without any concern for the debts incurred by the Indian workers in their \nhome country, Sigoal terminated Sabu and other Indian workers and fraudulently promised to \nseek  another  extension  of their  H-2B  visas  so  that  they  could  return  and  resume  their \nemployment with Signal. This of course was another false promise. \n212. Since first contracting with Defendants in India, Plaintiffs have yet to receive \nfrom  Defendants the green cards Defendants promised to them.  Despite clear contractual \nprovisions requiring them to do  so,  Defendants have refused to refund any of the moneys \nPlaintiffs paid to them for unsuccessful green card and visa processing. \n213. Since first contracting with Defendants in India, Plaintiffs have had to seek other \nlegal counsel to assist them in pursuing green card applications and other immigration relief, \nthereby incurring thousands of dollars in additional legal fees and costs which have not been \nreimbursed by Defendants. \n42 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 43 of 65\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nTHE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION ACT OF 2003 \n18 U.S.C. § 1589 (forced labor) and 18 U.S.C. § 1590 (trafficking with respect to peonage, \nslavery, involuntary servitude, or forced labor) \n(All Defendants) \n214.Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n215.

Plaintiffs  are  authorized to  bring  these  claims  pursuant to  the  civil remedies \nprovision of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003,  18 U .S.C.  § \n1595 (\"TVP A\"). \n217. In 2000, Congress enacted the TVPA to provide enhanced legal protections for \nvictims of human trafficking and to supplement existing forms of relief.  Congress specifically \nincluded protections for persons forced to work out of fear of serious harm, physical restraint, \nabuse of the legal process, or threats of the same. \n218.According to House Report 106-939, the new forced labor statute was \"intended \nto address the increasingly subtle methods of traffickers who place their victims in modem-\nday slavery, such as where traffickers threaten harm to third persons, restrain their victims \nwithout physical violence or injury, or threaten dire consequences by means other than overt \nviolence.\"  In particular, Congress clarified that the statute covered \"a broad array of harms, \nincluding  both  physical  and  nonphysical,\"  and  could  apply  where  the  perpetrator \n\"intentionally caus[ed]  the  victim  to  believe that  her  family  [would]  face  harms  such as \nbanishment, starvation, or bankruptcy in their home country.\" \n219. In 2003, Congress amended the statute to permit individual victims of trafficking \nto bring civil claims against their traffickers. \n43 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06220-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/07/13   Page 44 of 65\n220.

The Court noted Signal attached exhibits to support its arguments surrounding the \nexhaustion of administrative remedies. Because the Court did not consider those exhibits, it did not covert Signal’s \nmotion to a motion for summary judgment.

A \n  motion to reconsider filed outside this 28–day window is evaluated under the standards governing a motion for \nrelief from final judgment under Rule 60(b). Stangel v.

See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–2(a)(2) (“Section 703”)(“It shall be an unlawful \nemployment practice for an employer (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to \ndiscriminate  against  any  individual  with  respect  to  his  compensation,  terms,  conditions,  or  privileges  of \nemployment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex or national origin; or to limit, segregate, or (2) \nclassify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any \nindividual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such \nindividual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.”) \n \n27  Doc. 273–1, p. 4. \n \n \n  5 \n \n\n \n28  The Court does note that, even if exterritorial application of Title VII is not required, it is doubtful that the \n  allegations of the complaint in intervention for recovery of recruitment fees from Signal would state a claim for \nrelief that is plausible and capable of surviving a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss under Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly. \n550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 919 (2007) and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 139 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d \n868 (2009). To make out a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII, a plaintiff to show he was (1) a member \nof a protected class; (2) qualified for the position held; (3) subject to an adverse employment action; and (4) treated \ndifferently from others similarly situated. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 \nL.Ed.2d 668 (1973). In the Fifth Circuit, an “adverse employment action for Title VII discrimination claims ... \n‘include[s]  only  ultimate  employment  decisions  such  as  hiring,  granting  leave,  discharging,  promoting,  or \ncompensating.” McCoy v. City of Shreveport 492 F.3d 551, 559 (5th Cir.2007), quoting Green v. Administrators of \nTulane Educ. Fund, 284 F.3d 642, 657 (5th Cir.2002). “Title VII was only designed to address ‘ultimate employment \ndecisions, not to address every decision made by employers that arguably might have some tangential effect upon \nthose ultimate decisions.” Burger v. Central Apartment Mgmt., Inc., 168 F.3d 875, 878 (5th Cir.1999), quoting \nMattern v. Eastman Kodak Co., 104 F.3d 702, 707 (5th Cir.1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 932, 118 S.Ct. 336, 139 \nL.Ed.2d 260 (1997). To state an actionable discrimination claim under Title VII, the plaintiffs-intervenors’ claim for \nrecruitment fees must be based on a “tangible employment action [that] constitutes a significant change in \nemployment  status,  such  as  hiring,  firing,  failing  to  promote,  reassignment  with  significantly  different \nresponsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.” Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, \n764, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998)(emphasis added). The enormous debts at the start of their employment, \nmentioned by the plaintiffs-intervenors in briefs in support of their motion to reconsider (Doc. 273, p. 12), are not a \nsignificant change in their employment status with Signal. Signal’s use of the Recruiters is not an  “adverse \nemployment action” with respect to the plaintiffs-intervenors’ discrimination claim for recruitment fees under Fifth \nCircuit precedent. See Pegram v. Honeywell, Inc., 361 F.3d 272, 282 (5th Cir.2004)(“[A]n employment action that \n‘does not affect job duties, compensation, or benefits is not an adverse employment action.’ ”)(quoting Banks v. E. \nBaton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., 320 F.3d 570, 575 (5th Cir.2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 817, 124 S.Ct. 82, 157 L.Ed.2d \n34 (2003)). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  6 \n ",

The  party  opposing  summary  judgment  is \nfavor.

For example, one email \ndiscrimination.27  chain contains the subject line  “Indian Issues” and is \nIn  order  for  Kadakkarappally’s  retaliation  claim  to  marked with high importance and labeled confidential.38 \nsurvive  Signal’s  motion  for  summary  judgment,  there  Darrell  Snyder,  a  Signal  employee  who  supervised \nmust be sufficient evidence to convince a reasonable fact  Kadakkarappally  in  the  man  camp  and  handled \nfinder to find all of the elements of Kadakkarappally’s  Kadakkarappally’s complaints on a daily basis, sent an \nprima facie case.28 In other words, there must be a genuine  email  detailing  “the  latest  issue  with  the  Indian \nissue of material fact concerning his prima facie case.29  workers.”39 The email explains how a “source” in the man \nSignal argues Kadakkarappally cannot establish a prima  camp  told  Snyder  that  Kadakkarappally  and  another \nfacie case of retaliation because he cannot show (1) that  Indian  worker  “went  bunkhouse  to  bunkhouse  [that] \nhe engaged in protected conduct, or (2) that there is a  weekend to recruit workers to talk to a lawyer,” and \ncausal connection between his alleged protected conduct  “[t]hey were able to get approximately 35 to 40 workers \nand his termination—two essential elements of his prima  to see [a] lawyer.”40 The email goes on to discuss how \nfacie case.30 Kadakkarappally may not have specifically  “[t]he workers have complained about their treatment” \nused  the  words  “race  discrimination”  or  “alienage  and ends stating “the atmosphere in the camp tonight was \ndiscrimination”  when  complaining  to  Signal,  but  his  as  tense  as  [Snyder]  ha[d]  experienced  it.”41  The \ncomplaints  to  Signal  involved  the  work  and  living  responding  email  states:  “This  does  not  need  to  go \nconditions as they related specifically to the Indian H2–B  unchecked” and references needing to have “discussions \nworkers.31 Further, the requirement of showing causation  with the Indians to address legitimate complaints” and \nat  the  prima  facie  stage  is  much  less  stringent  than  that after, “we should know who we want and who we do \nproving the ultimate issue of unlawful retaliation.32 Very  not.”42  Kadakkarappally  was  terminated  on  March  9, \nclose temporal proximity of the protected activity and the  2007–just days after this email chain was exchanged.43 \nadverse  employment  action  is  sufficient  to  establish  Although temporal proximity, alone, may be insufficient \ncausation at the prima facie stage of a retaliation claim.33  to establish pretext, in this case, Kadakkarappally points \n   to additional competent summary judgment evidence in \nViewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the  the record creating a genuine dispute as to pretext. \nplaintiff, the Court concludes there is sufficient evidence    \nfrom  which  a  jury  could  find  that  Kadakkarappally  The Court finds there are genuine issues of material fact \nengaged in protected conduct and that there is a causal  as  to  pretext.44  Accordingly,  both  motions  for  partial \nconnection  between  the  protected  conduct  and  his  summary  judgment  on  the  retaliation  claim  must  be \ntermination. Thus, the burden shifts to Signal to articulate  denied. \na  legitimate,  non-retaliatory  reason  for  terminating    \nKadakkarappally.  Because  Signal  produced  a   \nnon-retaliatory justification—that Kadakkarappally made   \nthreats to Signal employees, his behavior was divisive and \ndisruptive,  and  Signal  could  not  appease him  through \nlegal means34—the burden shifts back to Kadakkarappally \nCONCLUSION \nto demonstrate Signal’s reasons for his termination were \nnot its true reasons, but rather were pretext for retaliation. \nPlaintiff  Jacob  Joseph  Kadakkarappally’s  Motion  for \nAn  employee  may  establish  pretext  by  “showing  the \nPartial  Summary  Judgment  as  to  Liability  on  his  42 \nemployer’s proffered explanation is false or unworthy of \nU.S.C. § 1981 Claim for Retaliation is DENIED.45 \ncredence.”35 \n  \n  \nSignal’s  Motion  for  Partial  Summary  Judgment \n*4 Signal contends Kadakkarappally exclusively relies on \nRegarding  Retaliation  is  DENIED  with  respect  to \nhis subjective, conclusory opinion that he was retaliated \nPlaintiff  Jacob  Joseph  Kadakkarappally’s  42  U.S.C.  § \nagainst,  which  is  not  competent  summary  judgment \n1981  claim.46  The  Court  defers  judgment  on  Signal’s \nevidence, and on temporal proximity between his alleged \nmotion  with  respect  to  Plaintiff  Sabulal  Vijayan’s  42 \nprotected  conduct  and  his  termination,  which  is \nU.S.C. § 1981 retaliation claim.47 \ninsufficient to establish pretext.36 Kadakkarappally points \n  \nto evidence that he received positive reviews and a pay \n  3 \n \n\n \nAll Citations  Empl.Prac.Cas.

The jury performed its task of \nassessing  damages.  The  jury’s  verdict  is  not  fatally \ninconsistent. The motion to alter the judgments on this \nground is not well-founded. \nDISCUSSION \n  \n \nOn June 6, 2015, Plaintiffs filed their Rule 59(e) motion, \n \nseeking an amendment of, or a new trial regarding, the \nCourt’s May 14, 2015 judgments in favor of Burnett and \nDewan and against Plaintiffs.11 In that motion, Plaintiffs  II. NOMINAL DAMAGES AND CIVIL RIGHTS \nset forth several theories on why the Court’s judgments  STATUTES \nshould be altered or amended, or in the alternative, why   \nthe  Court  should  order  a  new  trial  on  damages.12 \nPrincipally, the Plaintiffs argue that the Court’s judgments \nshould be amended because (1) the jury’s awards of $0  a. TVPA Counts \nagainst Burnett and Dewan were merely an attempt to  Plaintiffs next argue that, because Fifth Circuit precedent \navoid duplicative damage awards; (2) the Fifth Circuit  mandates  an  assessment  of  at  least  nominal  damages \nrequires an award of nominal damages when a defendant  when a defendant is found to have violated a civil rights \nis found to have violated a civil rights statute; and (3) the  statute, the Court should enter judgments for nominal \njury’s verdicts on liability and damages as to Burnett and  damages against Burnett and Dewan on Plaintiffs’ TVPA \nDewan cannot be reconciled.13  claims.21 The Court agrees with Plaintiffs’ argument. \n     \n  The Fifth Circuit has consistently held that “a plaintiff is \n  entitled to an award of nominal damages for the violation \nof  his  civil  rights,  even  where  there  is  no  injury.”22 \nAlthough  the  universe  of  “civil  rights”  violations  for \nI. DUPLICATIVE DAMAGE AWARDS  which  nominal  damages  are  appropriate  is  n0t  well \nFirst, Plaintiffs argue that the damages verdicts of $0  defined, the Fifth Circuit has provided some guidance, \nagainst Burnett and Dewan, personally, were entered due  awarding  nominal  damages  for  civil  rights  violations \nto  the  jury’s  belief  that  any  such  damages  would  be  traceable to the Constitution and to federal civil rights \nduplicative  of  those  awarded  against  Burnett’s  and  statutes. The Fifth Circuit has held, generally, that the \nDewan’s corporations.14 The Court finds this argument  violation of one’s constitutional rights is worth, at least, \nunpersuasive.  nominal damages.23 The Fifth Circuit in Farrar v. Cain \n   explained that nominal damages are appropriate when the \n*2 Count 1 in the jury verdict form is the TVPA claim.15  infringement  of  a  certain  and  fundamental  right  is \nThe interrogatories concerning damages awarded against  established, such as a violation of one’s rights under the \nBurnett individually are found on page 6 and are the first  First Amendment.24 Courts in the Fifth Circuit and beyond \ninterrogatories  dealing  with  Burnett  or  his  law  firm.16  have also awarded nominal damages to plaintiffs who \nThus,  the  interrogatories  regarding  damages  against  prove violations of their rights under section 1981 and \nBurnett  individually  came  before  the  interrogatories  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.25 \nconcerning  Burnett’s  corporate  law  firm.17  If  the  jury    \nintended to award damages against either Burnett or his  In  this  case,  however,  Defendants  argue  that  nominal \nlaw firm, but not both, it is more logical to assume they  damages are not available and should not be awarded to \nwould have awarded damages against Burnett, and not his  Plaintiffs,  because  the  claims  of  forced  labor  and \nlaw firm, due to the order in which the jury interrogatories  trafficking under the TVPA “do not rise to the level of a \nare formulated and appear.18 This is not what happened.  violation of a constitutionally afforded right.”26 The Court \n   disagrees  with  Defendants’  argument,  as  it  is  well \nThe same reasoning is true for the other counts against  accepted that the TVPA was intended to redress slavery \nBurnett  and  Dewan.19  More  specifically,  the  damages  and involuntary servitude, wrongs that are specifically \ninterrogatories concerning those counts, with regard to  addressed by the Thirteenth Amendment to the United \nBurnett and Dewan personally, are found before those \n  2 \n \n\n \nStates Constitution.27 Moreover, the TVPA “represents an  III. NEW TRIAL ON DAMAGES \neffort to increase civil rights protections,”28 and thus is   \nsimilar to the civil rights statutes under which nominal \ndamages have been awarded, inter alia, section 1983, \nsection 1981, and Title VII.29 In Francisco v. Susano, the  a.

Non–TVPA Counts  support the jury’s verdict.”38 \nIt should be noted that the Court’s reasoning with regard    \nto nominal damages is narrow and limited to the TVPA  In this case, the Court finds no justification for granting a \nnew trial on the non-TVPA counts.

The court continued: \nAn appropriate remedy for that error, however, is for the court itself to enter judgment awarding the claimant \nnominal damages. Although the Seventh Amendment generally prohibits a court from augmenting a jury’s award \nof damages, that proscription is not violated by the court’s entering judgment awarding nominal damages when \nthe jury has failed or refused to do so and the claimant is entitled to such damages as a matter of law. \nId. at *6 (quoting Robinson, 147 F.3d 153, 162 (2d Cir.1998)).

Signal (13-6218 c/w 13-6219, 13-6220, 13-6221)\nORDER  AND REASONS\nBefore the Court is a Motion to Dismiss filed by Billy Wilks, J&M Associates, Inc.,\nand J&M Marine & Industrial, LLC (collectively, the \"J&M Defendants\") in Achari v. Signal\n1\n\n(13-6218,  13-6219,  13-6220,  13-6221)(the  \"Achari  cases\").1  Plaintiffs  in  the\nChakkiyattil case (13-6219) filed an opposition to the J&M Defendants' motion.2 \nThe J&M Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims in all of the Achari cases for\nfailure  to  state  a  claim,  primarily denying the  factual  allegations  pled  in  Plaintiffs'\ncomplaints.3 Under Rule 12(b)(6), a district court may dismiss a complaint, or any part of\nit, for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted if the plaintiff has not set\nforth factual allegations in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief. Bell Atl.\nCorp. v. Twombly 550 U.S. 554 (2007); Cuvillier v. Taylor, 503 F.3d 397, 401 (5th Cir.\n2007). In assessing the Plaintiffs' complaint, the Court must accept all well-pleaded facts\nas true and liberally construe all factual allegations in the light most favorable to the\nPlaintiffs. Lowry v. Texas A&M Univ. Sys., 117 F.3d 242, 247 (5th Cir. 1997). \nThe Court finds the facts pled in Plaintiffs' complaints are sufficient to support their\nclaims against the J&M Defendants. This Court already denied a similar motion filed by the\nJ&M Defendants seeking to dismiss the Plaintiffs' RICO claim in David v. Signal (08-\n1220)(the \"David case\").4 The Court is not persuaded to reach a contrary decision when the\nfactual allegations in the Achari Plaintiffs' complaints are substantially similar to the\nPlaintiffs' allegations in the David case.  Moreover, for the reasons set forth in the Court's\nOrder and Reasons in the David case on the 12(c) Motion for Partial Judgment on the\nPleadings and 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss filed by Signal and the 12(c) Motion for Partial\n1R. Doc. 195. \n2R. Doc. 215.\n3The J&M Defendants' motion, filed pro se, does not specifically move under Rule 12(b)(6) or\n12(c) to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims. However, based on the arguments made in the J&M Defendants'\nmotion, the Court construes the motion as a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. \n4R. Doc. 288. \n2\n\nJudgment on the Pleadings filed by Burnett,5 the Achari Plaintiffs' complaints allege\nsufficient facts to survive a motion to dismiss. \nAccordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the J&M Defendants' Motion to Dismiss be and\nhereby is DENIED. \nNew Orleans, Louisiana, this 14th day of August, 2014.\n____________________________\n         SUSIE MORGAN\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n5R.

CIVIL ACTION\nPlaintiffs\nVERSUS No. 08-1220\nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL, LLC, et al., SECTION “E”\nDefendants\nRelated Cases:\nEQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY CIVIL ACTION\nCOMMISSION,\nPlaintiff\nVERSUS No. 12-557\nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL, LLC, et al., SECTION “E”\nDefendants\nLAKSHMANAN PONNAYAN ACHARI, et al.,\nCIVIL ACTION\nPlaintiffs\nVERSUS No. 13-6218\n (c/w 13-6219, 13-6220,\n13-6221, 14-732)\nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL, LLC, et al., SECTION \"E\"\nDefendants\nApplies To: Achari v. Signal (13-6218 c/w 13-6219, 13-6220, 13-6221)\nORDER  AND REASONS\nBefore the Court is a Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)1 and a Rule 12(c)\n1R. Doc. 148. All documents cited in this order were filed in the master case, Achari v. Signal (13-\n6218). \n1\n\nMotion for Judgment on the Pleadings both filed by defendant Burnett,2 as well as a Motion\nfor Partial Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) filed by defendant Signal International, LLC\n(\"Signal\").3  Plaintiffs oppose  all of the motions.4 Considering the briefs, the record, and the\nparties arguments at oral argument, the court rules as follows. \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nPlaintiffs are citizens of India who secured visas to work in the United States for\nSignal in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Plaintiffs allege the Defendants recruited\nthem to work as temporary workers at Signal's facilities in Pascagoula, Mississippi.\nPlaintiffs further allege Defendants forced them to pay recruitment fees, as well as\nimmigration  processing  and  travel  expenses.  Plaintiffs  allege  that  throughout  their\nrecruitment,  Defendants  promised  them  permanent  residency in  the  United  States,\nhowever, Defendants never took any steps to assist Plaintiffs in applying for or obtaining\ngreen cards. As a result of Defendants' actions, Plaintiffs claim they were discriminated\nagainst and subjected to forced labor as welders, pipefitters, and marine fabrication workers\nfor Signal. At Signal's facilities, Plaintiffs claim Signal forced the workers to live in\ndeplorable conditions and used various tactics to compel the Plaintiffs to continuing\nworking. \nPlaintiffs originally were a part of a putative class action in David v. Signal (08-\n1220)(the \"David case\"). Plaintiffs are current members of the class of Indian workers on\nwhose behalf the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") brought suit in\n2R. Doc. 228. The Court uses \"Burnett\" to collectively refer to the following defendants: Malvern\nC. Burnett, the Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, LLC and the Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, APC. \n3R. Doc. 150.\n4R. Doc. 159, R. Doc. 160, R. Doc.161, R. Doc. 222, R. Doc. 223, and R. Doc. 238. \n2\n\nEEOC v. Signal (12-557)(the \"EEOC case\").5 After the Court denied class certification in the\nDavid case, putative class members filed four separate actions in the Southern District of\nMississippi.6 On October 24, 2013, the four actions were consolidated and transferred to the\nEastern District of Louisiana.7 These four consolidated cases are collectively referred to\nherein as the Achari cases.  \nIn of each the Achari cases, Plaintiffs allege Signal, Burnett, and Dewan8 violated the\nTrafficking Victims Protection Act of 2003 (\"TVPRA\") and Signal violated the Civil Rights\nAct of 1866 (Section 1981).9 Additionally, Plaintiffs in the Krishnakutty case include claims\nunder the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\") (18 U.S.C. § 1962\net seq) and the Klu Klux Klan Act (42 U.S.C. § 1985) against Signal, Burnett, and Dewan.10\nPlaintiffs in the Achari cases also allege state law claims for fraudulent misrepresentation,\n5The term \"class\" is used collectively to describe the aggrieved individuals who the EEOC\nrepresents and does not implicate Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.\n6Achari v. Signal (13-6218) (47 former putative class members from the David case), Chakkiyattil\nv. Signal (13-6219) (28 former putative class members), Krishnakutty v. Signal (13-6220) (2 former\nputative class members), Devassy v. Signal (13-6221) (13 former putative class members).\n7R. Doc. 47. A fifth case from the Southern District of Mississippi, Singh v. Signal (14-732) was\ntransferred to the Eastern District of Louisiana on April 24, 2014 and consolidated with the Achari cases.\nR. Doc. 240. These motions were filed before the Singh case was transferred to this Court.\n8The Court uses \"Dewan\" to collectively refer to the following defendants: Global Resources, Inc.,\nDewan Consultants, and Sachin Dewan.\n9See R. Doc. 200 (the Achari complaint); R. Doc. 199 (the Chakkiyattil complaint); R. Doc. 201\n(the Krishnakutty complaint); and R. Doc. 198 (the Devassy complaint). In addition to Signal, Burnett,\nand Dewan, plaintiffs in each case name other defendants. In the Achari case, plaintiffs also name Michael\nPol as a defendant. In the Chakkiyattil case, plaintiffs name Billy Wilks, J&M Associates, Inc., and J&M\nMarine, Inc. as defendants. In the Krishnakutty case, plaintiffs name Indo-Amerisoft, LLC and Kurella\nRao as defendants. In the Devassy case, plaintiffs name Kurella Rao, Indo-Amerisoft, LLC and Michael\nPol as defendants. \n10R. Doc. 201, pp. 46-58. The Krishnakutty plaintiffs also name Kurella Rao and Indo-Amerisoft\nas defendants in their claims under RICO and the Klu Klux Klan Act. \n3\n\nnegligent  misrepresentation,  and  breach  of  contract.11  In  addition,  Plaintiffs  in  the\nKrishnakutty case seek relief for money had and received, and breach of fiduciary duty\nunder Mississippi law.12 \nSignal and Burnett had filed motions to dismiss in the Achari cases before they were\ntransferred from the Southern District of Mississippi and consolidated. Once the Achari\ncases were transferred, this Court ordered counsel for Signal and Burnett to re-file their\nmotions to dismiss with a new submission date.13 Both Signal and Burnett filed a Motion\nto Dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).14 The Plaintiffs in the Achari cases jointly filed oppositions\nto both motions.15 Plaintiffs in the Krishnakutty case filed a separate opposition to Burnett's\nmotion to specifically address the arguments made with respect to their claims.16 \nThe Court thereafter ordered Plaintiffs in each case to file an amended complaint.17\nThe Court also directed Signal and the Burnett Defendants to file supplemental memoranda\nclarifying their intention to reassert their motions to dismiss with respect to the amended\n11Four complaints addressed in these motions (Achari, Chakkiyattil, Krisnakutty, and Devassy)\nbring state law claims under Mississippi law. The complaint in the recently transferred Singh case does\nnot specify the law of which state its state law claims arise under. \n12R. Doc. 201, pp. 65-70.\n13R. Doc. 149. \n14R. Doc. 148, R. Doc. 150. \n15R. Doc. 159, R. Doc. 160. \n16R. Doc. 161.\n17R. Doc. 182. The Court instructed the plaintiffs to file amended and restated complaints\nspecifically setting forth the defendants against which each cause of action is asserted, the specific\ndamages sought under each cause of action, and the statute or other law on which the demand is based. \n4\n\ncomplaints.18 Plaintiffs filed supplemental oppositions to Signal and Burnett's supplemental\nmemoranda.19 Burnett also filed a Rule 12(c) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings,20\nwhich Plaintiffs opposed.21 The Court will consider each motion in turn. \nSTANDARD OF LAW\nThe Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss filed by Signal and Burnett and the Burnett's\n12(c) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings are all governed by the same legal standard.\nThe standard for dismissal under Rule 12(c) is the same as that for dismissal for failure to\nstate a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). Johnson v. Johnson, 385 F.3d 503, 528 (5th Cir. 2004). \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a district court may dismiss a\ncomplaint, or any part of it, for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted if\nthe plaintiff has not set forth factual allegations in support of his claim that would entitle\nhim to relief. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007); Cuvillier v. Taylor, 503\nF.3d 397, 401 (5th Cir. 2007). As the Fifth Circuit explained in Gonzales v. Kay:\n\"Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the\nspeculative level.\" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127\nS.Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). The Supreme Court recently\nexpounded upon the Twombly standard, explaining that \"[t]o survive\na motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual\nmatter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on\nits face.\" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 128 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173\nL.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct.\n1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929). \"A Claim has facial plausibility when the\nplaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the\nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct\n18R.

It follows that \"where the well-pleaded facts do not permit\nthe court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the\ncomplaint has alleged - but it has not 'show[n]' - that the pleader is\nentitled to relief.\" Id. at 1950 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). \n577 F.3d 600, 603 (5th Cir. 2009). \nThe Court cannot look beyond the factual allegations in the pleadings to determine\nwhether relief should be granted. See Spivey v. Robertson, 197 F.3d 772, 774 (5th Cir.\n1999); Baker v. Putnal, 75 F.3d 190, 196 (5th Cir. 1996). In assessing the Plaintiffs'\ncomplaint, the Court must accept all well-pleaded facts as true and liberally construe all\nfactual allegations in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs. Spivey, 197 F.3d at 774;\nLowrey v. Tex A & M Univ. Sys., 117 F.3d 242, 247 (5th Cir. 1997). \"Dismissal is appropriate\nwhen the complaint 'on its face show[s] a bar to relief.\" Cutrer v. McMillan, 308 F. App'x\n819, 820 (5th Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (unpublished) (quoting Clark v. Amoco Prod. Co.,\n794 F.2d 967, 970 (5th Cir. 1986)).  A court may grant a motion for judgment on the\npleadings when no genuine issues of material fact remain and the case can be decided as a\nmatter of law.  Erickson v. Pardus, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007).\nANALYSIS\nA. Signal's Motion to Partially Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim22\nSignal seeks dismissal of Plaintiffs' state law claims, claim for recruitment fees under\n1981, and claim for recruitment fees under the Klu Klux Klan Act. With respect to Plaintiffs'\nstate law claims, Signal argues those claims arise from the Plaintiffs' recruitment abroad to\nwork in the United States, and under Mississippi law, Plaintiffs' claims are implausible.23\nSimilarly, Signal argues Plaintiffs' claims for recruitment fees under Section 1981 and the\n22R. Doc. 150.\n23R. Doc. 150, p. 18. \n6\n\nKlu Klux Klan Act arise out of events occurring abroad and those statutes do not apply\nextraterritorially.24\n1. State Law Claims\nIn each of the Achari cases, Plaintiffs claim that all Defendants promised to secure\nthem permanent residency after their employment with Signal. Plaintiffs allege they paid\nexorbitant \"recruitment fees\" to the Defendants for processing immigration documents, yet\nDefendants failed to secure permanent residency for the Plaintiffs after their arrival in the\nUnited States. Plaintiffs also claim the Defendants misrepresented the nature of Plaintiff's\nemployment and immigration opportunities in the United States. For the Defendants'\nalleged failure to fulfill their promises to secure permanent residency, Plaintiffs assert\nbreach  of  contract  claims  under  Mississippi  law.  For  the  Defendants'  alleged  false\nrepresentations regarding Plaintiffs' opportunities for immigration and employment status,\nPlaintiffs assert fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation claims under Mississippi law.\nSignal argues the facts giving rise to Plaintiffs' state law claims involve Signal's alleged\nwrongdoing abroad. Signal believes the state law claims have a \"foreign basis\" because\nPlaintiffs' recruitment began in either India or the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Signal cites\nto Mississippi's choice-of-law rules to argue the state law claims are implausible because\nMississippi  law  would  not  recognize  claims  arising  from  events  occurring  abroad.\nAdditionally, the Krishnakutty Plaintiffs allege Defendants breached a fiduciary duty to\nPlaintiffs by failing to fulfill promises to obtain permanent residency or by misrepresenting\nPlaintiffs' ability to secure permanent residency.  The basis of the Krishnakutty Plaintiffs'\n24R. Doc. 150, p. 22.\n7\n\nclaims for money had and received is identical.  \nThe questions of which state's choice of law rules apply and which state's substantive\nlaw applies are questions of law for the Court.  These issues have not yet been decided and,\nas a result, Signal is not entitled to dismissal of the Plaintiffs' state law claims because it has\nnot established that the facts as alleged, accepted as true, fail to state a claim to relief that\nis plausible on its face. The Court cannot reasonably infer the defendant is liable or not\nliable for the misconduct alleged unless it knows the applicable law.  Accordingly, Signal's\nmotion to dismiss the Plaintiffs' state law claims is denied. Signal may refile its motion to\ndismiss the state law claims once these choice of law issues have been decided.25\n2. Claims under Section 1981 and the Klu Klux Klan Act\nPlaintiffs allege Signal unlawfully subjected the Plaintiffs to discriminatory terms\nand conditions of employment at Signal's facilities in Pascagoula, Mississippi based on race,\nethnicity, religion and alienage. Plaintiffs assert Signal violated 42 U.S.C. § 1981, which\nprohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of race.26 The Krisnakutty Plaintiffs\ninclude a claim under the Klu Klux Klan Act (42 U.S.C. § 1985), alleging Defendants\nconspired to deprive Plaintiffs of their Thirteenth Amendment rights to be free from forced\nlabor and involuntary servitude. Signal moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims under Section\n25Because this Court has federal question jurisdiction and is exercising supplemental jurisdiction\nover Plaintiffs' state law claims, the Court must apply the law in the state in which it sits. Erie Railroad Co.\nv. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). This includes the choice-of-law rules of the\nforum state. Klaxon v. Stentor Electric Manufacturing Co., 313 U.S. 487 (1941). When a case is\ntransferred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), courts apply the choice-of-law rules of the transferor state.\nFerens v. John Deere, 494 U.S. 516, 525 (1990). However, whether the Ferens rule applies to cases\ntransferred pursuant to the first-filed rule, such as this one, is unsettled. Accordingly, it is unclear which\nstate's choice-of-law rules apply to this case, and it is unclear which state's substantive laws apply.  \n26Section 1981 refers to racial discrimination in the making an enforcement of contracts, but the\nstatute has been read to provide a federal remedy against discrimination in employment on the basis of\nrace. See Adams v. McDougal, 695 F.2d 104 (5th Cir. 1983). \n8\n\n1981 and the Klu Klux Klan Act insofar as those claims seek recovery of recruitment fees\npaid abroad. Signal asserts Plaintiffs' recruitment occurred abroad and neither Section 1981\nnor the Klu Klux Klan Act apply extraterritorially. \nPlaintiffs' amended complaints do not seek recovery of recruitment fees under\nSection 1981 or the Klu Klux Klan Act.27 Plaintiffs' claims under Section 1981 are rooted in\nSignal's  alleged  discriminatory  acts  at  Signal's  facility  in  the  United  States.  The\nKrishnakutty Plaintiffs' Klu Klux Klan Act claims relate to Signal's alleged conspiracy to\ndeprive Plaintiffs' Thirteenth Amendment rights at Signal's Facilities in the United States.\nIn contrast, in each of the Plaintiffs' claims under TVPA, the Plaintiffs explicitly pray for\neconomic loss from recruitment fees paid to the Defendants.28 Thus, because the Plaintiffs\ndo not pray for recruitment fees under its Section 1981 or Klu Klux Klan Act claims, Signal's\nmotion to dismiss those claims is moot. \n27In the Achari case, Plaintiffs seek: \"compensatory damages (including, without limitation, loss of\nwages, loss of opportunity, pain and suffering, mental and emotional distress, prejudgment interest, and\nadditional economic loss from (1) medical expenses; (2) damages related to living and working conditions;\nand (3) mandatory housing and other fees paid to Signal), punitive damages, attorneys' fees in an amount\nto be proven at trial.\" See R. Doc. 200, p. 149. Plaintiffs in the Krishnakutty case seek: \"lost and unpaid\nwages, lost opportunities, pain and suffering (including emotional distress and humiliation), out-of-pocket\nexpenses, and other pecuniary losses including loss of property and/or business.\" See R. Doc. 201, p. 57.\nPlaintiffs in the Chakkiyatil case seek \"[C]ompensatory damages [including] housing fees paid to Signal\nand other charges made by Signal, adverse terms and conditions of employment resulting from\ndiscrimination (including underpayment of wages), pain, suffering, medical costs and lost wages resulting\nfrom on-the-job physical injuries related to discriminatory working conditions, damages related to living\nand working conditions, and damages suffered due to mental and emotional distress, as well as\nopportunity costs, out-of-pocket costs, and other pecuniary losses.\" See R. Doc. 199, p. 116. Plaintiffs in the\nDevassy case seek damages including: \"housing fees paid to Signal and other charges made by Signal,\nadverse terms and conditions of employment resulting from discrimination (including underpayment of\nwages), pain, suffering, medical costs and lost wages resulting from on-the-job physical injuries related to\ndiscriminatory working conditions, damages related to living and working conditions, and damages\nsuffered due to mental and emotional distress, as well as opportunity costs, out-of-pocket costs, and other\npecuniary damages.\" See R. Doc. 198, p. 72.\n28For example, in the Achari case, Plaintiffs pray for \"economic loss from recruitment and visa\nfees paid to Defendants.\" R. Doc. 200, p. 147. In the Chakkiyatil case, Plaintiffs pray for \"compensatory\nand punitive damages ... including recruitment fees.\" R. Doc. 199, p. 114. In the Devassy case, Plaintiffs\npray for \"compensatory and punitive damages, including recruitment fees...\" R. Doc. 198, p. 70.  \n9\n\nAccordingly, for the above stated reasons, Signal's 12(b)(6) Motion to Partially\nDismiss is DENIED as to the Plaintiffs' state law claims and DENIED AS MOOT as to\nclaims for recruiting fees under Section 1981 and the Klu Klux Klan Act. \nB. Burnett's 12(b)(6) Motion29\nBurnett  moves  to  dismiss  the  entirety  of  Plaintiffs'  complaints,  arguing  the\ncomplaints only allege \"unsupported and unsupportable conclusions\" as to all Defendants,\nand do not include factual material sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Burnett\nadditionally asserts Plaintiffs have not pled the allegations of fraud with the specificity\nrequired under Rule 9. With respect to Plaintiffs' state law claims, Burnett argues the acts\nalleged to form the basis of those claims occurred in India and the United Arab Emirates\nand are thus implausible under Mississippi law. Finally, Burnett argues Plaintiffs' state law\nclaims are barred by the passing of the statute of limitations.\n1. Sufficiency of Factual Material Alleged\na. TVPA Claims\nBurnett argues Plaintiffs' complaints lack factual allegations sufficient to state a\nclaim under the TVPA.  Burnett asserts Plaintiffs do not allege that Burnett ever forced\nPlaintiffs to work for Signal or ever threatened any Plaintiff with deportation if they refused\nto  continue  working  for  Signal.  Burnett  believes  he  provided  legal  and  necessary\nimmigration services to allow Plaintiffs to enter the United States. \nPlaintiffs' complaints include two related claims under the TVPA: a claim for forced\nlabor under 18 U.S.C. § 1589 (\"Section 1589\"), and a claim for trafficking under 18 U.S.C.\n29R. Doc. 148.\n10\n\n§ 1590 (\"Section 1590\"). Under 18 U.S.C. § 1595 (\"Section 1595\"), an individual who is a\nvictim of a violation under the TVPA  may bring a civil action against anyone who\n\"knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value from participation in a\nventure which that person know or should have known has engaged in an act in violation\nof [the TVPA].\" 18 U.S.C. § 1595. \nPlaintiffs seek relief under Section 1589, which prohibits anyone who \"knowingly\nprovides or obtains the labor or services of a person by any one of, or by any combination\nof, the following means: (1) by means of force, threats of force, physical restraint, or threats\nof physical restraint to that person or another person; (2) by means of serious harm or\nthreats of serious harm to that person or another person; (3) by means of the abuse or\nthreatened abuse of law or legal process; or (4) by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern\nintended to cause the person to believe that, if that person did not perform such labor or\nservices, that person or another person would suffer serious harm or restraint.\" 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1589.\nPlaintiffs allege Burnett placed advertisements and conducted seminars in Indian\ncities to recruit workers for Signal, promising \"employment based green cards\" and\npermanent residency in the United States.30 Plaintiffs' claim Burnett promised them green\ncards in order to induce Plaintiffs to pay large fees to travel and work in the United States.31\nPlaintiffs allege Burnett never took any steps to apply for permanent residency for the\nPlaintiffs.32 Based on their \"need to repay the substantial debt and interest [they] incurred\"\n30See, e.g., R. Doc. 200, pp. 21-22. \n31Id. at p. 22. \n32Id. at p. 23. \n11\n\nto pay Burnett's recruitment fees, Plaintiffs allege they felt \"intimidated into acquiescence\nand compelled to continue working for Signal.\"33 Plaintiffs allegations are sufficient to state\na claim under Section 1589(a)(2) for using \"serious harm\" to provide or obtain Plaintiffs'\nlabor.34\nUnder Section 1589(c)(2), \"serious harm\" includes financial harm \"that is sufficiently\nserious ... to compel a reasonable person .. to perform or to continue performing labor\nservices in order to avoid incurring that harm.\" Courts have found that threats of being in\ndebt and being unable to repay those debts constitutes \"serious harm\" sufficient to survive\na motion to dismiss. See Nunag-Tanedo v. East Baton Rouge Parish School Bd., 790 F.\nSupp. 2d 1134 (C.D. Cal. 2011); Panwar v. Access Therapies, Inc., 2013 WL 5486783 (S.D.\nInd. Sept. 30, 2013). Because Plaintiffs have alleged Burnett induced them into incurring\nsubstantial debts and Plaintiffs felt compelled to continue working to repay those debts,\nPlaintiffs' complaints contain sufficient facts to state a claim under Section 1589(a)(2). \nPlaintiffs also allege Burnett violated Section 1590 of the TVPA. Section 1590\nprovides a claim against any person who \"knowingly recruits, harbors, transports, provides,\nor obtains by any means, any person for labor or services in violation of this chapter...\" 18\nU.S.C. § 1590. The violations of Section 1589 are included in the chapter for violations of\nSection 1590. Thus, because Plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts to state a claim under\nSection 1589, Plaintiffs have also pled sufficient facts to state a claim under Section 1590\nagainst Burnett as a person who recruited Plaintiffs for labor in violation of Section 1589.\n33See, e.g., r. Doc. 200, p. 85. \n34As Plaintiffs point out in their original opposition, their allegations are also likely sufficient to\nstate a claim under Section 1589(a)(3) for using \"abuse of the legal process\" to provide Plaintiffs' labor. \n12\n\nSee Nunag-Tanedo, 790 F. Supp. 2d at 1147 (\"Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that\nDefendants are involved in a fraudulent scheme involving forced labor, and with the\nintentional nature of this matter Plaintiffs have also sufficiently alleged that Defendants\nrecruited, transported, and provided Plaintiffs for that forced labor.\").\nIn sum, Plaintiffs claims under the TVPA are sufficiently supported by factual\nallegations in each complaint. Burnett insists his actions were \"consistent with what would\nhappen in the ordinary course of events in representing non-immigrant workers recruited\nfor work in the United States.\"35 However, Burnett's disagreement over the version of the\nfacts alleged in Plaintiffs' complaints is insufficient to support a motion to dismiss. The\nCourt must accept all factual allegations in Plaintiffs' complaints as true, and Burnett has\nfailed to show Plaintiffs' claims under the TVPA should be dismissed. \nb. State Law Claims\nBurnett  also  argues  Plaintiffs'  complaint  does  not  set  forth  sufficient  factual\nallegations to support their state law claims for fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent\nmisrepresentation, and breach of contract. Burnett asserts the facts alleged demonstrate\na \"fulfillment of Burnett's obligations to the Plaintiffs.\"\nAs explained above, the questions of which state's choice of law rules apply and\nwhich state's substantive laws apply have not yet been decided. As a result, Burnett is not\nentitled to dismissal of the Plaintiffs' state law claims because he has not established that\nthe facts as alleged, accepted as true, fail to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. \nThe Court does find that Plaintiffs have satisfied Rule 9(b)'s requirement of pleading fraud\n35R. Doc. 148, p. 6. \n13\n\nwith particularity. Accordingly, Burnett's motion to dismiss the Plaintiffs' state law claims\nis denied. Burnett may refile his motion to dismiss the state law claims, to the extent that\nit is not based on Rule 9(b), once choice of law issues have been decided. \n2. Extraterritoriality\nBurnett moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' state law claims by briefly putting forth the same\nargument as Signal. That is, because a portion of the facts giving rise to Plaintiffs' state law\nclaims occurred abroad, Burnett argues those claims should be brought under the laws of\nIndia or the UAE. Burnett asserts Plaintiffs' complaint does not show a remedy exists under\nIndian law, thus Plaintiffs' state law claims should be dismissed. \nAs explained above, the questions of which state's choice of law rules apply and\nwhich state's substantive laws apply have not yet been decided. As a result, Burnett is not\nentitled to dismissal of the Plaintiffs' state law claims because he has not established that\nthe facts as alleged, accepted as true, fail to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. \nAccordingly, Burnett's motion to dismiss the Plaintiffs' state law claims is denied. Burnett\nmay refile his motion to dismiss the state law claims once choice of law issues have been\ndecided. \n3. Statute of Limitations\nLastly, Burnett seeks dismissal of Plaintiffs' state law claims for fraud, negligent\nmisrepresentation  and breach of  contract  asserting  the  statute  of  limitations  under\nMississippi law ran by March 8, 2011.36  \nAs explained above, the questions of which state's choice of law rules apply and\n36R. Doc. 148-1, p. 7. \n14\n\nwhich state's substantive laws apply have not yet been decided. As a result, Burnett is not\nentitled to dismissal of the Plaintiffs' state law claims because he has not established that\nthe facts as alleged, accepted as true, fail to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. \nAccordingly, Burnett's motion to dismiss the Plaintiffs' state law claims is denied. Burnett\nmay refile his motion to dismiss the state law claims once choice of law issues have been\ndecided. \nC. Burnett's 12(c) Motion37\nBurnett filed a Rule 12(c) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings in Achari v. Signal\n(13-6218) seeking to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims based on the same grounds as his Rule\n12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss. For the reasons discussed above, Burnett has not carried his\nburden  of  showing  dismissal  is  warranted.  Accordingly,  Burnett's  12(c)  Motion  for\nJudgment on the Pleadings is DENIED. \nCONCLUSION\nFor the above-stated reasons, IT IS ORDERED that Signal's 12(b)(6) Motion for\nPartial Dismissal be and hereby is DENIED as to the Plaintiffs' state law claims and\nDENIED AS MOOT as to claims for recruiting fees under Section 1981 and the Klu Klux\nKlan Act.  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Burnett's Rule 12(b)(6) Motion for Partial\nDismissal be and hereby is DENIED. \nIT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  Burnett's  Rule  12(c)  Motion  for  Partial\nJudgment on the Pleadings be and hereby is DENIED. \n37R.

CIVIL ACTION\nVERSUS NO. 08-1220\n    \nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL, L.L.C, ET AL. SECTION  \"E\" (3)\nRELATED CASE:\nLAKSHMANAN PNNAYAN ACHARI, ET AL. CIVIL ACTION\nVERSUS NO. 13-6218 C/W\n13-6219, 13-6220,\n13-6221, 14-762\nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL, L.L.C., ET AL. SECTION \"E\" (3)\nRELATES TO: 08-1220, 13-6218\nORDER\nOn August 27, 2014, the Motion to Quash Signal's Bank Records Subpoenas [Doc. #1709]\nin Civil Action No. 08-1220 (David) and the Motion to Quash Signal's Bank Records Subpoenas\n[Doc. #299]  in Civil Action No. 13-6218 (Achari) came on for oral hearing before the undersigned. \nPresent were Eben Colby on behalf of the Chakkiyattil plaintiffs, Meredith Stewart on behalf of the\nDavid plaintiffs, and Mitchell Hasenkampf and Elham Rabbani on behalf of Signal International,\nL.L.C.  After the oral hearing, the Court took the motions under advisement.  Having reviewed the\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 345   Filed 09/16/14   Page 2 of 6\nmotions, the oppositions, and the case law, the Court rules as follows.\nI. Background\nThis Court has oft repeated the factual background of this lawsuit in earlier orders, see David\nv. Signal Int'l, L.L.C., Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 WL 4344540 (E.D. La. Sept. 21, 2012), and will\nnot do so again.  The background of the related cases is near-identical to that of David.\nII. Law and Analysis\nDefendant Signal International, L.L.C. (\"Signal\") served subpoenas on both Capital One and\nMerchant & Marines (\"M&M\") banks, seeking the personal bank records of hundreds of individuals,\nincluding the plaintiffs in the David and Achari cases.  \nPlaintiffs contend that the subpoenas are not compliant with Louisiana law for two reasons. \nCiting Louisiana Revised Statute §6:333(C)(2), they first argue that the subpoenas failed to include\nthe required affidavit in which the subpoenaing party attests that a copy of the subpoena was served\non each customer whose records are sought.  Plaintiffs also maintain that service was not made at\nleast fifteen business days before the return date.  The return dates on the subpoenas were only eight\ndays after service.\nCiting case law, plaintiffs ask the Court to quash the subpoenas and order Signal to comply\nwith Louisiana law. \nSignal has withdrawn its subpoena to Capital One.  The only one in dispute is thus the one\npropounded to M&M.  Signal maintains that because plaintiffs allege financial coercion – even that\nSignal directed M&M to not release funds from plainitffs' own bank accounts to them – it has the\nright to discover how plaintiffs purchased new cars, took cross-country vacations and purchased\nother luxuries.  \n2\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 345   Filed 09/16/14   Page 3 of 6\nCiting Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45, Signal contends that the only ground on which\nplaintiffs may move to quash the subpoenas is that they require the disclosure of privileged or\nprotected matter.  Signal notes that plaintiffs make no substantive objections to the subpoena.\nSignal also argues that plaintiffs can not rely on Section 6:333, which specifically excludes\nfrom the statute's scope any bank that is neither domiciled in, nor having its principal place of\nbusiness in, nor engaging in the business of banking in Louisiana. Signal notes that there is no\ndispute that M&M bank does not operate in Louisiana and is based in Pascagoula, Mississippi. \nEven were the statute to apply, Signal argues that the Court must apply Louisiana's conflict-\nof-laws provisions.  Under that analysis, Mississippi has the greater interest in the application of its\nown laws.   \nPlaintiffs note that Section 6:333 provides an alternative definition for a \"bank\":  \"'Bank'\nshall also mean a savings bank, a savings and loan association, a company issuing credit cards, or\nany other business offering credit.\"  Because M&M issues credit cards and offers credit, plaintiffs\nargue that Section 6:333 applies to it.\nPlaintiffs also contend that Louisiana's interest in providing notice to individuals whose\nbanks records have been subpoenaed does not conflict with Mississippi law.  Because Louisiana law\ndoes not per se prevent the production of bank records (only requiring notice and an opportunity to\nobject), plaintiffs maintain that there is no conflict with Mississippi law.\nEven if there were, plaintiffs argue, Louisiana has an interest in enforcing its bank laws. \nThey note that here, a Louisiana law firm, acting under the authority of a Louisiana-based court, has\ncompelled the production of bank records to a Louisiana address.  They thus contend that Louisiana\nhas an interest in enforcing the 15-day notice to individuals.\n3\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 345   Filed 09/16/14   Page 4 of 6\nPlaintiffs also maintain that the subpoenas are overbroad.  They note that the subpoenas seek\nproduction of every single banking record related to hundreds of individuals.  They contend that the\nrequest is all based on the testimony of one individual, Hemant Khuttan, who testified that he bought\na car and that he believes that others had done so as well.  Plaintiffs argue that they had no access\nto public transportation to obtain necessities.  Some employees thus pooled money together to\npurchase a car.  They contend that this hardly constitutes \"luxuries.\"\nPlaintiffs maintain that exploring hundreds of individuals' bank records for a period of years\nis not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  They argue that Signal\nshould be required to specify what information it seeks.  Plaintiffs also ask that they be allowed to\nreview the information first to redact personal identifying and financial information. \nFor the following reasons, the Court grants the motions in part.  Rule 26(b)(1) provides that\n“[p]arties may obtain discovery regarding any non-privileged matter that is relevant to any party's\nclaim or defense.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). The rule specifies that “[r]elevant information need not\nbe admissible at the trial if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of\nadmissible evidence.” Id.  The discovery rules are accorded a broad and liberal treatment to achieve\ntheir purpose of adequately informing litigants in civil trials. Hebert v. Lando, 441 U.S. 153, 176\n(1979).  Nevertheless, discovery does have “ultimate and necessary boundaries.”  Oppenheimer\nFund, Inc. v. Sanders, 437 U.S. 340, 351 (1978) (quoting Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 507\n(1947)).  Further, “it is well established that the scope of discovery is within the sound discretion\nof the trial court.”  Coleman v. Am. Red Cross, 23 F.3d 1091, 1096 (6th Cir. 1994).\n4\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 345   Filed 09/16/14   Page 5 of 6\nRule 45 governs the issuance of subpoenas, and provides that on timely motion, the issuing\ncourt must quash or modify a subpoena if it requires disclosure of privileged or other protected\nmatter, or otherwise subjects the subpoenaed person to undue burden.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(c)(3).\nUnder Rule 45(c)(1), “[a] party or attorney responsible for issuing and serving a subpoena must take\nreasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a person subject to the subpoena.”\nFed. R. Civ. P. 45(c)(1).\nThe Court first pretermits the question of whether Louisiana or Mississippi law applies. \nWhether M&M is a \"bank\" under the second definition of Section 6:333 is a merits determination\nfor the District Court.  Even were this Court to so hold, however, quashing the subpoenas at this\npoint and on this ground would be no more than an exercise in formality.  At this point in the\nlitigation, plaintiffs have had more than 15 days to object to the subpoenas, which they have done\nin their motion and in their reply.\nPlaintiffs argue only that the subpoenas are overbroad; M&M does not make this argument. \nWhile the subpoenas seek bank records for hundreds of individuals, the Court finds that the time\nframes are limited and, with regard to some individuals, mere days or months.  However, the Court\nconcludes that at this late stage of the litigation,1 the best course of action here is to order Signal to\nre-propound the subpoenas and limit them at this time to the named plaintiffs in the David and\nAchari lawsuits.  The return date shall be fifteen (15) days from the date of service.  The Court\nalso orders Signal to make the return of the documents on counsel for plaintiffs.

Signal (13-6218, 13-6219, 13-6220, 13-6221, 14-732) \n     \n   \nORDER AND REASONS \n  Before the Court is a Motion to Certify for Interlocutory Appeal or Alternatively \nto  Stay  Pending  Application  for  Mandamus  Relief  filed  by  Defendants  Signal \n1 \n \n\nInternational, L.L.C., Signal International, Inc., and Signal International Texas, G.P. \n(collectively  \"Signal\").1    Defendants  Malvern  Burnett,  the  Law  Offices  of  Malvern \nBurnett,  A.P.C.,  and  Gulf  Coast  Immigration  Law  Center,  L.L.C.  (the  \"Burnett \nDefendants\") have filed a similar Motion.2  The question presented is whether the Court \nshould certify for interlocutory appeal its orders prohibiting the discovery of certain \npost-Signal information, including immigration status.  For the following reasons, the \nCourt  finds  that  the  criteria  for  interlocutory  appeal  are  not  present  and  that  a \ndiscretionary  stay  pending  the  outcome  of  a  petition  for  mandamus  relief  is  not \nwarranted.  The Motions are DENIED. \nBACKGROUND3 \n   A  protective  order  in  the  above-captioned  matters  prohibits  Signal  from \ndiscovering,  inter  alia,  the  current  immigration  status  of  any  plaintiff,  the  current \naddress or place of residence of any plaintiff, and the employers or potential employers \nof any plaintiff post-termination of employment with Signal.4 Moving Defendants argue \nthe protective order unduly restricts their ability to discover impeachment evidence.5  \nThe  Court  has  rejected  this  argument  on  multiple  occasions,  finding  that  the  in \nterrorem effect of producing the requested information outweighs Signal's interest in \nunbridled  discovery.    Recognizing  the  futility  of  beating  a  dead  horse,  Moving \nDefendants now ask the Court to certify its orders upholding the protective order for \n                                                             \n1 R. Doc. 1776 in the David Case, R. Doc. 472 in the EEOC Case, and R. Doc. 351 in the Achari Cases. \n2 R. Doc. 1808 in the David Case and R. Doc. 384 in the Achari Cases.  The Burnett Defendants \nincorporate by reference the arguments set forth in Signal's motion. \n3 The facts of the related cases have been detailed ad nauseum in previous orders.  Familiarity is assumed. \n4 R. Docs. 367 and 476 in the David Case, R. Doc. 285 in the EEOC Case, and R. Doc. 307 in the Achari \nCases. \n5 The Burnett Defendants also argue the protective order precludes them from assessing the economic \nharm, if any, suffered by the plaintiffs. \n2 \n \n\ninterlocutory appeal.  In the alternative, Moving Defendants request a discretionary stay \nof the above-captioned matters while they petition the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for  \na writ of mandamus. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n  An interlocutory appeal from a non-final order in a civil case is permissible when \n(1) the order involves \"a controlling question of law,\" (2) there is \"substantial ground for \ndifference of opinion\" on the question presented, and (3) an immediate appeal would \n\"materially  advance  the  ultimate  termination  of  the  litigation.\"6    The  district  court \ncannot certify an order for interlocutory appeal unless all three criteria are present.7  In \ndetermining whether certification is appropriate, the Court is mindful that interlocutory \nappeal  is  \"exceptional\"  and  \"does  not  lie  simply  to  determine  the  correctness  of  a \njudgment.\"8   \nLAW AND ANALYSIS \n  The  parties  spill  much  ink  arguing  whether  the  protective  order  involves  a \ncontrolling question of law on which there exists a substantial ground for difference of \nopinion.  The Court need not decide these issues today.  For the reasons explained more \nfully below, certification is not warranted because an immediate appeal would hinder—\nrather than hasten—the ultimate termination of the related cases.   \n  An immediate appeal materially advances the termination of litigation if it would \neliminate  the  need  for  trial,  simplify  the  issues  for  trial,  or  reduce  the  burden  of \n                                                             \n6 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). \n7 See Aparicio v. Swan Lake, 643 F.2d 1109, 1110 n.2 (5th Cir. 1981) (\"Section 1292(b) sets out three \ncriteria all of which must be met before the district court may properly certify an interlocutory order for \nappeal.\") (emphasis added). \n8 Clark-Dietz & Assocs.-Eng'rs, Inc. v. Basic Constr. Co., 702 F.2d 67, 68—69 (5th Cir. 1983). \n3 \n \n\ndiscovery.9    Certification  of  the  protective  order  would  accomplish  none  of  these \nobjectives.10  As a non-dispositive order, the reversal or affirmance of a discovery order \nwould seldom (if ever) eliminate the need for trial.   Nor would a decision from the Fifth \nCircuit simplify the issues for trial or reduce the burden of discovery.  If anything, \nvacature of the protective order would make discovery even more onerous and unwieldy.   \n  Rather than expediting a final disposition, an interlocutory appeal would actually \ndelay resolution of the related cases.  The David Case is set for trial in less than three \nmonths.  Even if the Fifth Circuit chose to hear the interlocutory appeal, the parties \ncould not realistically expect a decision for at least six months.11  Regardless of the Fifth \nCircuit's ruling, the David Case would then have to be returned to the Court's jury \ndocket, resulting in an additional lengthy delay.  Moreover, an extensive delay in the \nDavid Case would likely produce a ripple effect of continuances in the EEOC Case and \nthe Achari Cases.  And once the David Case and the related cases are finally tried, \nappealable  issues  will  almost  undoubtedly  still  exist,12  which  could  lead  to  another \nround of appeals and remands.13   \n                                                             \n9 B&B Advisory Servs., LLC v. Bombardier Aerospace Corp., No. Civ. A. 02-2695, 2003 WL 22326511, at \n*2 (E.D. La. Oct. 9, 2003); see also Panda Energy Int'l, Inc. v. Factory Mut. Ins., Nos. 3:11–CV–003–K, \n3:10–CV–2541–K, No. 09–30453 (SGJ), and No. 09–30453 (SGJ), 2011 WL 610016, at *5 (N.D. Tex. Feb. \n14, 2011) (\"An appeal materially advances the termination of litigation when it accelerates or simplifies \ntrial proceedings.\"). \n10  Courts  in  the  Fifth  Circuit  have  recognized  that  a  discovery  order  is  seldom  appropriate  for \ninterlocutory appeal.  See, e.g., In re Tullius, No. EP-11-mc-365-KC., 2011 WL 5006673, at *2 (W.D. Tex. \nOct. 20, 2011) (\"District courts in the Fifth Circuit are hesitant to grant leave to appeal interlocutory \norders relating to discovery.\"); Decena v. Am. Int'l Cos. (AIG), No. 11-1574, 2012 WL 1640455, at *2 (E.D. \nLa. May 9, 2o12) (\"As several courts have recognized, pretrial discovery orders will seldom meet the \nrequirements for interlocutory appeal.\"). \n11 As the David Plaintiffs note in their opposition memorandum, the average time for disposition in the \nFifth Circuit is 9.3 months.  See R. Doc. 1811-3 at p. 13. \n12 The related cases present many issues of first impression, which increases the likelihood of appeal. \n13 Such piecemeal appeals are disfavored.  See Mohawk Indus., Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. 100, 106 \n(2009) (\"Permitting piecemeal, prejudgment appeals . . . undermines 'efficient judicial administration' \nand encroaches upon the prerogatives of district court judges, who play a 'special role' in managing \nongoing litigation.) (quoting Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U.S. 368, 374 (1981)); Clark-\nDietz, 702 F.2d at 69 (\"The basic rule of appellate jurisdiction restricts review to final judgments, avoiding \nthe delay and extra effort of piecemeal appeals.\"). \n4 \n \n\n  Having declined to certify the protective order for interlocutory appeal, the Court \nnow considers the alternative relief requested by Moving Defendants—a stay pending \nresolution of an as-of-yet-filed petition for mandamus relief in the Fifth Circuit.  There \nis no automatic stay of district proceedings while a petition for writ of mandamus is \npending.14  Accordingly, any such stay is imposed under the district court's general \ndiscretionary authority.15 \n  A district court has inherent authority to manage its docket, which includes the \npower to stay proceedings.16  The moving party bears a \"heavy burden\" to demonstrate \nthat a stay is appropriate.17  \"Where a discretionary stay is proposed, something close to \ngenuine necessity should be the mother of its invocation.\"18   \n  For largely the reasons set forth above, Signal has failed to make the necessary \nshowing.  The hardship and inconvenience that would result from a stay substantially \noutweighs any benefit,19 especially in light of the fact that mandamus relief is unlikely to \nbe granted.20  Accordingly, the Court will not issue a stay. \nCONCLUSION \n  Signal seeks to appeal an interlocutory ruling, the resolution of which will not \nmaterially advance the related cases to final judgment.  Accordingly, the Court will not \ncertify the ruling for interlocutory appeal.  The Court also finds that Signal has failed to \ndemonstrate that extraordinary circumstances warrant a discretionary stay.   \n \n                                                             \n14 Woodson v. Surgitek, Inc., 57 F.3d 1406, 1416 (5th Cir. 1995). \n15 See id. \n16 Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936). \n17 Costal (Bermuda) Ltd. v. E.W. Saybolt & Co., 761 F.2d 195, 203 n.6 (5th Cir. 1985) \n18 Id. \n19 See Landis, 299 U.S. at 254 (instructing lower courts to \"weigh competing interests and maintain an \neven balance\" in deciding whether to issue a stay). \n20 See In re LeBlanc, 559 F. App'x 389, 392—93 (5th Cir. 2014) (noting that writ of mandamus is rarely \nissued with respect to discovery orders).  \n5 \n \n\n  New Orleans, Louisiana, this 14th day of October, 2014. \n \n  ________________________________ \n  SUSIE MORGAN \n  UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n6 \n ",
