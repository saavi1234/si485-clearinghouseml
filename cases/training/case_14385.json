Plaintiff's counsel further advised that although they agree to the consolidation for the stated purpose, they advise there are factual differences between the two cases that may impact the issue of transfer.

    "summary": "<p>This case is part of the series of <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=33\">Signal International cases</a>. It was consolidated with <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14380\"><i>Achari v. Signal International</i></a> and continues on that page.</p><p>On Aug. 14, 2013, 13 Indian guestworkers filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi for harm suffered as a result of an allegedly fraudulent and coercive employment recruitment scheme. The plaintiffs filed this suit after District Judge Jay Zainey <a href=\"http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-LA-0010-0016.pdf\">denied class certification</a> on January 3, 2012 in a related case, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14377\"><i>David v. Signal International</i></a>. The complaint alleged violations of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (18 U.S.C. §1589 (forced labor) and 18 U.S.C. §1590 (trafficking)) and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. §1981), as well as claims for fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract. The plaintiffs were represented by private law firms. </p><p>Plaintiffs were allegedly brought into the United States to provide labor and services to the defendant, Signal International, a company based in Pascagoula, Mississippi with operations in the Gulf Coast region, in the business of providing repairs to offshore oil rigs. The complaint alleged that the plaintiffs paid Signal's recruiters as much as $25,000 for travel, visa, and recruitment fees, but upon arrival in the United States found out they would not receive the green cards promised to them. Instead, plaintiffs were forced to pay additional fees ($1050 per month) to live in racially segregated labor camps, and were subject to squalid living conditions and threats of both legal and physical harm if they complained about the conditions or decided not to provide labor. </p><p>On Oct. 17, 2013, the District Court (Judge Robert H. Walker) entered an order consolidating this matter with the <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14380\"><i>Achari</i></a> case. The Court  (Chief U.S. District Judge Louis Guirola, Jr.) then transferred this case and <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14380\"><i>Achari</i></a>, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14381\"><i>Chakkiyattil v. Signal International</i></a>, and <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14383\"><i>Krishnakutty v. Signal International LLC</i></a> to the Eastern District of Louisiana. On October 24, 2013, the case was assigned to Judge Susie Morgan and consolidated with the <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14380\"><i>Achari</i></a> case. </p><p>The Court closed the Achari case on May 26, 2017 without prejudice due to settlement agreement. The settlement established a claims process and ensures that all aggrieved individuals included in the litigation may receive relief in spite of the bankruptcy proceedings. In addition to monetary relief, Signal International's CEO issued a statement acknowledging the company's wrongdoing and apologizing for its treatment of the guest workers. The Court retained jurisdiction such that any party may reopen the case if any of the unlocated plaintiffs are located so that they may be paid pursuant to the settlement agreement. </p>",

(aka \nMEDTECH CONSULTANTS), \nDefendants. \nCOMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND \nI.  This is a human trafficking case brought by workers from India who were \ntrafficked into the State of Mississippi. Defendants collectively engaged in a scheme to defraud \nPlaintiffs out of tens of thousands of dollars and, in the wake ofa devastating hurricane in the \nGulf Coast region, unlawfully turned them into an exploitable source of cheap labor. The \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 2 of 78\nDefendants worked together to defraud each of the Plaintiffs, falsely promised them that they \nwould receive permanent residence in the United States, trafficked them into the United States, \nforced them to live in squalid and unsanitary conditions that damaged their health and \npsychological well-being, discriminated against them on the basis of their race, ethnicity, \nreligion, and alienage, and threatened them with financial ruin and adverse immigration action if \nthey balked or complained. \n2.  Plaintiffs Varghese Kurisinkal Devassy, George Chacko Edavazhickal, Prasad \nKunju Kunju, Ampattu Varughese Mathew, Antony Sajan Oottuparambil Michael, Sivan \nRaghavan, Vijayanair Sankarapillai, Anil Scaria, Mandeep Singh, John Malakaran Thomas, Saju \nChristy Vallarian, Isaac Wilson Vazhikudilil, and Benny Yohannan, each a former employee at a \nPascagoula, Mississippi facility operated by Signal International, LLC and Signal International, \nInc. (collectively \"Signal\"), bring this action to recover for the unlawful and fraudulent behavior \nby Defendants Signal, Malvern C. Burnett, the Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, Gulf Coast \nImmigration Law Center, LLC, Sachin Dewan, Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd., Kurella Rao, Indo \nAmerisoft LLC, Michael Pol, and Global Resources Inc. \n3.  Plaintiffs are skilled workers and Indian nationals who responded to \nadvertisements in local newspapers in India and the United Arab Emirates promising \nemployment and permanent residence in the United States.  The advertisements invited welders, \npipefitters, and other skilled workers to attend seminars run by Defendants Sachin Dewan and \nDewan Consultants in late 2003 and early 2004 to learn about this seemingly once-in-a-lifetime \nopportunity.  Hundreds of workers responded, including Plaintiffs. \n2 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 3 of 78\n4.  At the seminars, Plaintiffs heard directly from Sachin Dewan, Kurella Rao, and \nMalvern Burnett that, for the price of between five and six lakh rupees  (between $11,000 and \nI \n$14,000 in 2004 U.S. dollars), they would be transported to the United States, given high-paying \njobs in their fIeld, and permitted to live permanently in the United States with their families.  All \nthis would take only 18 months to accomplish.  Although the cost was extraordinarily high for \nworking-class Indians, Defendants promised them that they would quickly recoup these costs \nwith steady, lucrative jobs in the United States. \n5.  Skilled workers such as Plaintiffs often struggled to find work in India. Many of \nthem had traveled around the world-to Dubai, Qatar, South Africa, Nigeria, and other \ncountries-for paying jobs, so they were accustomed to offers for work overseas.  Defendants' \noffer, however, was too good to refuse because it included permanent residence in the United \nStates. So each of the Plaintiffs signed an agreement written in English with Defendants, \nalthough Plaintiffs-mostly Malayalam speakers-generally could not read or understand the \nagreement.  Plaintiffs then raised the money to pay for the opportunity by depleting their savings, \nselling any property they had, and borrowing money from family members, or even worse, from \nmoneylenders (often referred to as \"bladesmen\" in India) at usurious rates. \n6.  Months and years passed without Defendants fulfilling their promises. When \npushed, Defendants blamed their inability to deliver the promised green cards on red tape at the \nU.S. Department of Labor or the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina.  Nevertheless, they \nadvised Plaintiffs to be patient.  Plaintiffs, whose entire life savings and those of their families \nwere invested in this opportunity, were powerless to do anything but wait.  As the months \nI A lakh is an Indian lenn meaning [00,000, so five [akh rupees means 500,000 rupees. \n3 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 4 of 78\npassed, Plaintiffs' financial woes increased, and they became entirely reliant on Defendants to \ndeliver on their promises. \n7.  In mid-2006, many of the Plaintiffs saw a new round of advertisements from \nDefendant Dewan Consultants in the local newspapers for welders and pipefitters to fill \ntemporary jobs in the United States, again with the promise of green cards for those who took \nthem.  The jobs were at Defendant Signal International's facilities in Pascagoula, Mississippi and \nOrange, Texas, where Signal worked to repair the shipping wreckage from Hurricane Katrina. \nDesperate to pay down their debts, Plaintiffs insisted that they be given some of these jobs. \nDewan agreed, for an additional fee, of course.  Dewan assured them that accepting these \ntemporary jobs would not jeopardize their green cards, which they would receive while working \nfor Signal. \n8.  Dewan and his associates carefully instructed Plaintiffs how to answer questions \nasked by U.S. consular officials, never revealing the amount of money paid to Defendants or the \npromise of a green card.  Once the visas were approved, Dewan made them sign additional \ndocuments in English without adequate time to read them, forced them to make their last \npayments, and confiscated any documentary evidence of their transactions with Dewan.  Only \nthen did Dewan give them back their passports and plane tickets and send them on their way. \n9.  Plaintiffs traveled to the United States in late 2006 and were horrified by what \nthey saw when they reached Signal's facilities in Pascagoula, Mississippi. Their living \nconditions were deplorable.  Signal forced them into overcrowded trailers in a fenced-in property \nwith armed guards preventing visitors and carefully monitoring the Indian workers, including \nPlaintiffs.  Signal workers referred to the camp as \"the Reservation.\"  Signal served them rotting \nfood that was often inedible and made them sick.  And to add insult to injury, Signal charged \n4 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 5 of 78\nthem each $35 per day, or as much as $1050 per month, for this room and board.  Plaintiffs were \nnot permitted to opt out of the room and board provided by Signal; it was deducted from their \npay even if they lived or ate elsewhere. \n10.  The work conditions were no better.  Signal supervisors verbally abused Plaintiffs \nand derided them for their race and alienage.  They forced Plaintiffs to perform dangerous jobs \nwith inadequate safety equipment, knowing that Plaintiffs had no choice but to obey their \ncommands.  All of this was reserved solely for Signal's Indian workers.  Its non-Indian workers \ncould live and eat where they pleased, were not forced to pay for room and board, and performed \nrelatively easier and safer tasks at work.  Signal could not even provide the Plaintiffs with steady \nwork, although it continued to charge them $35 a day even if they did not work, so Plaintiffs \nwere unable to pay down their debts as they were promised. \n11.  Signal threatened anyone who complained about these conditions with reduced \npay, suspension, dismissal, or deportation.  They threatened that if any individual worker \nchallenged Signal, then all of them would be deported back to India with no hopes of ever \npaying off their debts.  In March 2007, just months after Plaintiffs arrived, Signal decided to \nmake a show offorce by rounding up several of the workers who complained, detaining them, \nfiring them, and deporting them. One of the detained workers was so desperate not to return to \nIndia with his crushing debt that he attempted suicide by slashing his wrists. \n12.  After Signal's crackdown on Indian workers who complained, many of the \nworkers began to escape from Signal's facility, slowly smuggling out their few belongings and \nthen slipping away.  Others remained at Signal as long as they could to pay down their debts, but \nthe repair work from Hurricane Katrina eventually abated, and Signal let the rest of them go. \n5 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 6 of 78\n13.  Despite the vast debts accumulated by Plaintiffs, Defendants' promises proved \nillusory.  In fact, despite years of promises, none of the Defendants ever applied for, or intended \nto apply for, any green cards on behalf of any of the Plaintiffs.  Indeed, unbeknownst to \nPlaintiffs, Signal certified to the U.S. Government in the H-2B visa applications that the workers, \nincluding Plaintiffs, were needed solely for temporary work. \n14.  Plaintiffs, however, have continued to live with the consequences of Defendants' \nfraudulent promises.  Since leaving Signal, many of them have struggled to feed themselves and \ntheir families, let alone pay down their debts.  They have suffered through bouts of \nunemployment.  Some of them have been imprisoned for being in the United States without \nproper visas. None of them has recovered financially from the false promises made by \nDefendants or their scheme to traffic vulnerable workers into the United States and exploit them \nfor cheap labor. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \nIS.

Defendant Sachin Dewan and his company, Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd., \ninitiated a scheme in or about 2003 to lure Indian welders, pipe-fitters and other skilled laborers \ninto agreements in which Dewan promised green cards, permanent residency in the United \n11 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 12 of 78\nStates, and lucrative employment in exchange for the equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars \npaid upfront by those workers. In advertisements'placed in local newspapers and in seminars \nconducted in India and the United Arab Emirates, Sachin Dewan, Kurella Rao (a Louisiana \nbased labor recruiter), and Malvern Burnett (a Mississippi- and Louisiana-based attorney) \npromised hundreds of workers, including Plaintiffs, that they could obtain green cards for \nthemselves and their families within 18 months.  The seminars were conducted largely in English \nand Hindi, with which many of the workers, including Plaintiffs, had little familiarity. \n43.  In order to take advantage of this opportunity, Plaintiffs would have to pay the \nequivalent of up to $14,000 in three installments.  This was an enormous sum for most Indian \nworkers, approximately 30 times the 2004 per capita income of India.  Plaintiffs often struggled \nto find work to feed their families in India and had to travel around the world to find steady \nemployment.  However, Defendants promised them that they would recoup the expense of the \nopportunity being offered with the high wages they were promised in the United States, and \nthrough the long-term employment opportunities that would be available to them and their \nfamilies as permanent U.S. residents. \n44.  As a result, Plaintiffs relied on Dewan's, Rao's, and Burnett's promises that they \nwould be quickly compensated by steady and relatively lucrative employment in the United \nStates and agreed to pay the money. \n45.  Dewan initiated this scheme in collaboration with Rao and his company, Indo-\nAmerisoft, as well as with Burnett and his companies, the Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett \nand the Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, LLC.  Dewan informed Plaintiffs either that Indo \nAmerisoft would employ them directly or that it would place them in suitable, high-paying jobs \n12 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 13 of 78\nin the United States, with Burnett providing legal services to facilitate the immigration \npaperwork. \n46.  Plaintiffs scraped together the money to pay the first installment to Dewan and \nRao.  They liquidated their life savings, sold property, and borrowed money from family, friends, \nand other creditors, sometimes at usurious rates.  Defendants also loaded new, unexplained fees \nonto Plaintiffs, from minor fees (such as $45 \"testing fees\") to significant additionallast-rninute \ntravel expenses.  This left Plaintiffs heavily in debt, which could only be repaid if Defendants \nfulfilled their promises and found them steady work in the United States. \n47.  However, the Defendants did not deliver on their promises.  Although they \npromised that Plaintiffs would be in the United States with green cards within 18 months, \nDefendants showed little progress by mid-2005.  They blamed the delays on red tape at the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor, as well as on Hurricane Katrina, which they said damaged Rao's and \nBurnett's businesses.  Plaintiffs could do nothing but wait as their debts compounded.  They \nremained at the mercy of Dewan, Rao, and Burnett, who retained their initial payments. \n48.  Even in the face of significant delays, Dewan, Rao, and Burnett refused to refund \nany fees for any reason.  When certain Plaintiffs expressed reluctance to continue with the \nimmigration process or pay the next fee installment, Dewan, Pol, and Burnett threatened \nforfeiture of all money paid to that point. \n49.  In or about January 2006, Dewan, Rao and Burnett informed most Plaintiffs that \ntheir \"labor certifications\" had been approved by the U.S. Department of Labor, which triggered \nthe second installment payment.  Plaintiffs again scraped together the required funds, since they \nwould lose their initial payments if they did not continue to pay Defendants.  Even in the face of \nsignificant delays, Dewan, Rao, and Burnett refused to refund any fees for any reason.  Again, \n13 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 14 of 78\nwhen certain Plaintiffs expressed reluctance to continue with the immigration process or pay the \nnext fee installment, Dewan, Rao, and Burnett threatened forfeiture of all money paid to that \npoint. \n50.  Although Plaintiffs were forced to double-down on their investments by paying \nthe second installment, Defendants still made no visible progress toward getting Plaintiffs their \npromised green cards or employment in the United States.  As the months continued to pass, \nPlaintiffs' debts and their financial woes continued to increase. \nDefendants Initiate a New Recruitment Scheme for Temporary Laborers \n51.  Signal International is a Gulf Coast-based company that specializes in the \nconstruction, fabrication, and repair of vessels and marine rigs.  The devastation caused by \nHurricane Katrina in August 2005 presented both an opportunity and a challenge for Signal.  The \nrebuilding effort offered significant potential for new work fixing damaged oil rigs, ships, and \nother marine platforms.  At the same time, however, because the hurricane also destroyed or \ndamaged thousands of homes along the Gulf Coast, including in Pascagoula, some of Signal's \nworkforce had temporarily left the area. \n52.  In early 2006, Michael Pol, President of Global Resources, Inc. (\"Global\"), a \nrecruiting firm that places Indian workers in jobs in the United States, approached Signal with a \npurported solution to its problem.  At a meeting in January or February of 2006, Pol told Signal's \nChief Financial Officer Chris Cunningham, its Senior Vice President and General Manager \nRonald Schnoor, and its Vice President of Productions for Mississippi Operations Bill Bingle, \nthat he could deliver first-class pipefitters and welders from India at no cost to Signal.  Pol \ninformed Signal that he would work with local immigration attorney Malvern Burnett and India \nbased recruiter Sachin Dewan to bring skilled welders from India.  The workers themselves \n14 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 15 of 78\nwould pay for all costs and fees associated with the recruitment process, immigration processing, \nand travel to the United States, and Signal would not reimburse the workers for these fees. \nSignal would pay the workers between $14 and $18 per hour, depending upon skill level. \n53.  On April 18,2006, Signal executed a document entitled \"Skilled Worker \nRecruitment Agreement\" (the \"Recruitment Agreement\") with Global that authorized Global to \nrecruit foreign skilled workers for employment at Signal \"under the 'H-2B' temporary program \nand/or the 'permanent residence' process.\"  Pursuant to the Recruitment Agreement, Global \nwould be responsible for all costs associated with recruitment, transportation, and entry of the \nforeign workers into the United States and would deliver the workers \"at no cost to Signal\" to the \nairport of Signal's choice.  The cost incurred by Pol would be deducted directly from the foreign \nworkers' wages and paid to Pol/Global.  In short, Defendants paid nothing for this opportunity; \nthe future employees paid everything. \n54.  On June 19,2006, Signal executed a power of attorney with Dewan's company, \nDewan Consultants, appointing Dewan Consultants as Signal's \"representative in India to \nfacilitate the recruitment of skilled workers to the United States of America\" for employment at \nSignal.  The power of attorney authorized Dewan Consultants to advertise, conduct seminars and \ntrade tests, and sign any necessary legal documentation on Signal's behalf. \n55.  Also in mid-2006, Signal entered into an attorney-client relationship with Burnett \nto advise Signal on immigration issues pertaining to Signal's need for workers.  Signal and \nBurnett later memorialized their engagement in a written retainer agreement.  Pursuant to that \nagreement, Signal would not be responsible for any of Burnett's legal fees. Rather, under the \nterms of the agreement, Burnett took funds from the \"recruitment fees\" charged to the workers to \npay for the legal services he provided to Signal. \n15 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 16 of 78\n56.  Beginning in mid-2006, Signal, both via its own employees and the other \ndefendants, traveled to India in order to recruit workers.  In printed advertisements and in-person \nmeetings in India, Defendants promised Plaintiffs that in exchange for \"recruitment fees\" \nranging anywhere from the equivalent of $1 0,000 to $25,000, Defendants would provide \nPlaintiffs with jobs at Signal and assist them in applying for and receiving green cards.  At least \none of the advertisements promised \"permanent lifetime settlement in the U.S.A. for self and \nfamily.\" \n57.  In subsequent recruitment seminars, Defendants told the workers that because the \npermanent residency process could take up to two years to complete and Signal's need for \nworkers was immediate, Defendants would first assist Plaintiffs in obtaining temporary H-2B \nwork visas while simultaneously applying for green cards.  Several Signal employees, including \nSignal Special Projects Manager John Sanders and Vice-President of Productions for Mississippi \nOperations William Bingle, traveled to India and attended these sessions.  Sanders also oversaw \nthe immigration interviews and served as contact between Signal and consular officials. \n58.  Hundreds of Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, had already been recruited by \nDewan, Burnett, and Rao years earlier, albeit for green cards rather than for temporary work \nvisas.  Many of these workers saw the advertisements distributed by Defendants and contacted \nDewan Consultants to determine why it was recruiting additional welders and pipefitters for an \nopportunity in the United States when it had not yet fulfilled its promises to them.  Dewan \nassured them that they could pursue this opportunity as well and travel to the United States on \ntemporary work visas while the Defendants continued to process their green card applications. \nDewan assured them that accepting the temporary visas would not affect their green card \n16 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 17 of 78\nprocess, although he would require them to pay extra to take advantage of the opportunity to \nwork for Signal. \n59.  Because this would allow Plaintiffs to begin to pay off their overwhelming debts, \nthey agreed to accept this work under temporary visas, based on Defendants' repeated promises \nof permanent residency.  Dewan informed them that they would have to take a skills test \nadministered by Signal and be interviewed by U.S. consular officials.  Most of the plaintiffs \ntraveled to Chennai, India, at their own expense for this purpose. \n60.  Before their interviews at the U.S. consulate, Dewan prepared the Plaintiffs, \ntelling them that they must not reveal how much they had paid for their visas or that they had \nbeen promised permanent residency.  Dewan told Plaintiffs that if they told the truth about the \nsignificant fees they had paid, their visas would be cancelled and the Defendants would keep the \nmoney they had already collected.  As Pol explained to Signal employee John Sanders in an \nAugust 24, 2006 email: \nMal[vem Burnett], Sachin [Dewan] or I[] needs to be with each \nand every candidate going into the consulates before their \ninterview [because] [t] hey sometimes say the dumbest things and \nneed to be coached on the proper way to interview .... [T]here are \nsome things that should not be known to the consulate personnel, \nsuch as the fact that we are going to process them for a green card. \nIf one of those guys says he is going to the U.S. for immigration \nand Signal is sponsoring him for permanent residence (green \ncard) ... he is a goner. \n61.  As a result of this coaching, none of the Plaintiffs revealed the nature of \nDefendants' scheme to consular officials, who took Plaintiffs' passports and informed them that \nthey would be returned to Dewan after their visas were approved. \n62.  Once the approvals were completed, Dewan informed the Plaintiffs that they must \ntravel, again at their own expense, to Mumbai, India, before leaving for the United States.  They \n17 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 18 of 78\nwere told that they should bring the third installment payment, including money for airfare, as \nwell as all paperwork evidencing the agreements with or payments to Defendants. When they \narrived in Mumbai, Dewan told them that they must sign various documents in English without \nadequate time to review the documents,  and despite the fact that none of them spoke English \nfluently and some hardly at all.  Dewan refused to tell them what the documents were that they \nwere signing. \n63.  For example, Dewan had the workers, including Plaintiffs, sign \"memoranda of \nunderstanding\" that, among other things, informed them that \"Signal International, LLC has \norally promised the Facilitator [Dewan Consultants] ... that ... [Signal] will be willing to file and \nprocess their employment base [sic] Green Card.\"  Dewan Consultants also issued form letters to \nthe Plaintiffs once they were selected to travel to Signal, informing them that Signal \"shall \nproceed with your Green Card for United States of America.\" \n64.  Dewan also informed them that they must surrender all their documentation to \nhim before he would give them their passports and plane tickets to the United States.  If they did \nnot do so, they would lose their passports and all the money that they had invested so far. \nPlaintiffs did so, then boarded flights to the United States. \n65.  Plaintiffs would not learn until much later that Defendants' promises regarding \ngreen cards for Plaintiffs were illusory.  Defendants had not taken, and had no intention at that \ntime of taking, any steps to assist the Plaintiffs in applying for or receiving green cards.  To the \ncontrary, Signal (with the knowledge and assistance of the remaining Defendants) represented to \nthe United States Government that it would employ the workers only temporarily, and that the \nworkers would be returned to India \"within the ... year.\"  At no point did Defendants take any \nsteps to assist Plaintiffs in applying for or receiving a green card. \n18 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 19 of 78\n66.  Plaintiffs, of course, were never told of Signal's representations to the United \nStates Government.  The Plaintiffs were unaware that Defendants' promises of employment and \npermanent residency were false, and they relied on these false promises to their detriment. \nSignal Forces Plaintiffs to Live in Crowded and Unsanitary Conditions \n67.  Each of the Plaintiffs was assigned to work at Signal's fabrication facility in \nPascagoula, Mississippi, and to live in a nearby \"man camp\" built in the fall of2006 specifically \nfor the Indian workers.  Signal employees and management referred to the Pascagoula man camp \nas \"the Reservation.\"  They discussed among themselves, including in written email \ncommunication, that housing the workers in a secluded man camp on the outskirts of town was \npreferable, since it would keep the Indians segregated from the rest of the Pascagoula, \nMississippi community. \nSqualid Living Conditions \n68.  When Plaintiffs reached the man camp after their lengthy travel from India, they \nwere disheartened.  The men were forced to sleep in squalid trailer-like bunkhouses, with up to \n24 men in each bunkhouse.  The bunkhouses were so small that they were jammed to capacity \nwith bunk beds, with little room to maneuver between them.  The top bunks were so close to the \nceiling and the bottom bunks so close to the top bunks that Plaintiffs could barely sit up in their \nbeds. \n69.  Privacy in the bunkhouses was impossible, and sleep was difficult, due to the \nnoise from such close quarters, oppressive smells, and the comings and goings of workers who \nworked on different shifts.  Some workers reported rats living in their sleeping areas and \noccasionally scurrying across them as they slept. \n19 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 20 of 78\n70.  The men were forced to share only two· toilets, so there were often long lines to \nuse the facilities and to get ready for work in the morning.  The showers were also dangerous, \nwith unglued electrical conduit joints near the showers, exposing workers to potential \nelectrocution. \n71.  These conditions fell far short of basic requirements of habitability.  For example, \nthe federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") guidelines state that \nbunkhouses of similar purpose should have a minimum of 50 square feet of floor space per \nhabitant.  Signal's bunkhouses offered less than 18 square feet of floor space per worker. \nLikewise, OSHA guidelines require bunk beds to be at least 48 inches apart from other beds. \nSignal's bunk beds were so tightly packed together that workers were essentially sleeping next to \neach other. \nn. \nWorkers told Signal personnel on numerous occasions that they found these \nconditions to be intolerable.  Internal communications among Signal personnel discussed the \n\"overcrowding,\" acknowledging that the Pascagoula camp was at least \"3 bunk-houses\" shy of \nappropriate capacity, and that \"more toilet/sink capacity\" was needed. \nRotten Food \n73.  The food provided by Signal was deplorable.  Meals were offered exclusively in a \nmess hall in the man camp, which was only open during limited hours.  Workers who showed up \na few minutes late for a meal often were denied food altogether.  Those who did eat often were \nserved rotten food or food riddled with insects. \n74.  Plaintiffs also were required to bring food from the mess hall for their lunches at \nSignal's Pascagoula facility.  However, because the workers had to leave for work very early in \nthe morning, their already rotting food would sit and bake in the Mississippi heat for several \n20 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 21 of 78\nhours before they had the opportunity to eat it, by which time it was completely spoiled and \ninedible. \n75.  Workers frequently complained to Signal personnel that the food was so bad that \nthey were left hungry.  Others complained to Signal that the food was making them physically \nill.  In an email to other Signal personnel, Signal Senior Vice-President & General Manager Ron \nSchnoor acknowledged the \"bad, stale, molded, and otherwise poor quality food.\" \nRampant Disease \n76.  Even apart from the kitchen conditions, the man camp itself was a breeding \nground for bacteria and disease.  Workers frequently became severely ill. \n77.  As explained by the Signal's manager of the Pascagoula man camp: \nOur Indians have been dropping with sickness like flies.  [They 1a re getting \nworried and believe there are unhealthful conditions in the camp.  It is true. The \nreason is because the plumbing was so shoddily done by GE's subcontractors, and \nwater has leaked everywhere and stagnated as a result, which serves as a bacterial \nbreeding ground. \nPerpetual and Abusive Oversight \n78.  Signal instilled in Plaintiffs a climate of fear through perpetual and invasive \noversight and surveillance. \n79.  The Pascagoula man camp was located in an isolated industrial area that was \nmiles removed from other residential communities, shopping facilities, worship houses, and \nother basic amenities.  The man camp was enclosed by fences and accessible only by a single \nentrance, which was guarded by an armed security guard at all times.  When returning \"home\" \nfrom work and entering the camp, Plaintiffs were required to show identification and subject \nthemselves and their belongings to search.  Their movements into and out of the camp were \nlogged. \n21 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 22 of 78\n80.  Guests were not normally permitted in the man camp.  Instead, Plaintiffs were \npermitted to see visitors only in the parking lot. \n81.  Because the camp was isolated, Plaintiffs relied upon transportation from Signal \nto and from work and also to other populated areas.  However, Signal would only take them to \nWaI·Mart or the bank.  Even then, Plaintiffs had little privacy, as Signal security would \noccasionally follow them into Wal·Mart. \n82.  Although the camp manager, John Sanders, arranged to take some Indian workers \nto his Pentecostal church, he would not arrange for them to attend the local Catholic Church, \nalthough many of the workers were practicing Catholics.  When a group of the workers \norganized transportation to the Catholic Church through the local priest and a congregant, \nSanders noted this and began to more closely surveil the group of Catholic workers and its \nleaders. \n83.  Signal's private security forces entered the Plaintiffs' bunk area at night.  Signal \npersonnel and camp security guards conducted \"surprise searches\" of the bunkhouses, including \nsearches of workers' personal belongings. \n84.  Plaintiffs were not told when these searches would be conducted (again, in what \nwas supposed to be Plaintiffs' \"home\"), nor were they apprised of what it was Signal was \nlooking for. \n85.  Signal prohibited Plaintiffs from drinking alcohol at the camp.  Violation \nsubjected Plaintiffs to fines of $250 and suspension from work.  A second offense would result \nin a $500 fme; a third offense, $750. The prohibition of alcohol was modeled after Signal's \npolicies for conduct in the workplace despite the fact that Plaintiffs were living, not working, in \nthe man camp. \n22 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 23 of 78\n86.  Signal employed other methods of forcing the Plaintiffs to endure the abusive \nconditions.  In keeping with its focus on deflecting labor costs, upon Plaintiffs' arrival, Signal \nrequired them to set up \"direct deposit\" bank accounts with a local bank, to which Signal also \nhad access.  These accounts gave Signal control over Plaintiffs' ability to leave the facility \nbecause Signal could threaten to cut off their access to the accounts at any point.  Indeed, this is \nexactly what happened.  In April, 2007, after certain Indian workers fled the Pascagoula camp, \nthey were denied access to their accounts, at the behest of Signal.  This had the intended effect of \nintimidating and coercing the remaining workers, including Plaintiffs, into compliance. \n87.  Deeply indebted, fearful, isolated, disoriented, and unfamiliar with their rights \nunder United States law, Plaintiffs felt compelled to continue working for Signal, on Signal's \nonerous terms and in abusive and inhumane conditions. \n88.  Signal's non-Indian workers were not subjected to any of this intru~ive oversight. \nSignal did not bar its non-Indian workers from having visitors or drinking alcohol in their homes. \nNor did Signal confine its non-Indian workers to crowded bunkhouses or subject them to \ninvasive searches of their homes or belongings and near-constant surveillance.  Nor did it require \nnon-Indian workers to open bank accounts controlled by Signal at a particular bank. \nSignal Charged Plaintiffs Approximately $1050 \nEach Month to Live in These Conditions \n89.  For the privilege of living in these deplorable conditions, Signal automatically \ndeducted from Plaintiffs' paychecks $35 dollars per day (approximately $1,050 per month). \nFrom this amount, $21 was allocated towards rent and $14 towards food.  This amount was \ndeducted from Plaintiffs' paychecks even on days when they did not get paid because Signal \ncould not provide work or sent them home on account of rain. \n23 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 24 of 78\n90.  Michael Pol personally received $1.50 per day per Plaintiff from the $14 food \ncost in pure profit for having referred a caterer, Laxmi Catering, to Signal.  When Pol was later \nterminated by Signal, the $1.50 per Plaintiff per day profit was not remitted to the Plaintiffs but \nwas instead paid to another caterer. \n91.  Before the $35 per day value was set, Signal's Senior Vice President Ronald \nSchnoor initially recommended that Signal charge the workers $53.50 per day. Schnoor reached \nthat figure by calculating the amount it would take to amortize over just ten months the entire $7 \nmillion cost that Signal incurred building the man camps in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and Orange, \nTexas. Schnoor dismissed the devastating impact of this exorbitant $1,600 per month fee by \ncavalierly asserting the Plaintiffs and their fellow workers would all be \"happy campers\" because \nSignal's living arrangements and wages were likely to be an improvement over conditions in \nIndia. \n92.  After a short time in the camp, workers (including certain Plaintiffs) began \ncomplaining about the poor conditions and asked to live outside the camp in accommodations of \ntheir own choosing.  Some of the workers came into contact with locals residents who offered to \naccommodate them in better conditions for a fraction of the cost.  However, Signal refused to \nallow this, claiming that they could not provide transportation to work to those who did not live \nat the camp. Signal's official response to the complaints was to inform Plaintiffs that if they \ntried to live outside the camps, Signal would continue to deduct $35 per day from their \npaychecks. Given their substantial debts, this wage deduction left Plaintiffs with no choice but \nto remain at the camp.  Alternatively, Signal told some workers that it had spent a lot of money \nto build the camp, so the workers had to live in the camp. \n24 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 25 of 78\n93.  One Signal employee, Darrell Snyder, responded to complaints that if he were \nplaced in charge of the man camp, he would not give in to the \"misguided notion that some of \nthese Indians can be reasoned with\" but would instead \"most defiantly [sic] go on a 'rat hunt'\" to \ndetermine who was causing \"dissension\" among the workers. \n94.  Signal did not require any non-Indian workers to pay for Signal's capital \nexpenditures, nor did it require any other workers to pay for living expenses, whether or not they \nwere living in Signal-provided housing. \n95.  Signal imposed this onerous policy on the Indian workers in order to avoid paying \nany of its own expenses.  By exploiting the Plaintiffs' tenuous financial position, heavy debt \nload, precarious immigration situation and fear of job loss, Signal knew that they and their \ncoworkers would have no choice but to continue working at the company.  Indeed, because of \nthe grip in which Signal held its Indian workers, the Plaintiffs felt compelled to remain at the \nPascagoula man camp. \n96.  By contrast, workers of non-Indian race, ethnicity, or alienage were not required, \nor even allowed, to live in and/or pay for housing in the Pascagoula man camp. \nSignal Forces Plaintiffs to Work in Dangerous and Discriminatory Conditions \n97.  Signal also forced the Indian laborers to work in hard and unsafe working \nconditions to which non-Indian workers were not subjected.  Signal also forced them to endure \nregular anti-Indian invective from Signal personnel, along with threats to deport them if they did \nnot do Signal's every bidding. \n98.  The Indian workers were required to perform the most dangerous work at the \nPascagoula facility, often without the benefit of proper safety equipment.  For example, Plaintiffs \nwere forced to climb deep into the hulls of the ships, which could be three or four stories down in \n25 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 26 of 78\nvery small spaces that were dark, dirty, smoke-filled, and unsafe.  Although the hulls often were \nilluminated by portable lights, supervisors and non-Indian workers would often unplug the lights \nin orde~ to free up a power outlet, leaving the Indian workers deep inside an unlit ship and forced \nto make their way to the surface in the dark.  By contrast, Signal assigned non-Indian workers to \nperform welding jobs on the surface of the ships, where the smoke from the welding could more \neasily dissipate. \n99.  Signal did not provide the steady work that Plaintiffs had been promised.  Some \nworkers were told that they would have to take unpaid vacation for weeks at a time when Signal \ndid not have projects.  Signal also frequently canceled work during rainstorms, sending the \nworkers back to the bunkhouses without pay.  Even when this happened, Signal consistently \nrequired the workers to pay $35 per day for room and board, thereby adding to the workers' debt. \n100.  Signal also charged Plaintiffs and other Indian workers for the use of tools and \nbasic safety equipment, such as gloves.  They later discovered that the prices that Signal charged \nfor these materials was significantly inflated over regular retail prices.  Some workers continued \nto work with worn-out gloves, thereby exposing themselves to injury, because they could not \nafford to purchase new ones from Signal. \n101.  Signal at times refused medical assistance to Plaintiffs and other Indian workers \nwho were injured.  The workers sometimes hid injuries they sustained on the job from the Signal \nsupervisors, since they feared being fired or sent back to the bunkhouses without pay to recover. \n102.  Defendants' racial animus and discrimination against Plaintiffs and the other \nIndian workers took other, equally abusive, forms. \n103.  Whether on \"the Reservation\" or at the worksite, Plaintiffs repeatedly heard \nSignal employees, including supervisors, use offensive and racist language in speaking or \n26 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 27 of 78\nreferring to Plaintiffs and the other Indian workers.  Management frequently referred to Indian \nworkers by badge number, instead of attempting to pronounce their names. \n104.  Signal also displayed a shocking lack of respect for Plaintiffs' religious beliefs. \nSignal knew that many of the workers were highly religious.  In particular, Signal knew that \ncertain of its workers were Sikh.  Wearing a beard is an article of faith in Sikhism.  In the Sikh \ntradition, a beard demonstrates a love of God and respect for the natural form God bestows on \nman.  Signal nevertheless demanded that Sikh workers shave their beards after arriving at the \nPascagoula camp and threatened to deport them if they would not do so.  When some Sikhs were \nforced to shave their beards, they sat on the floor and cried, distraught.  Workers of non-Indian \nrace, ethnicity, or alienage and not of the Sikh religion were not subject to similar conditions of \nemployment. \n105.  Signal also required Plaintiffs to engage in repeated \"skills testing\" evaluations \nthat non-Indian workers were not required to take, and subjected Plaintiffs to on-the-job \ndiscipline, periods without work, and unfavorable job assignments to which workers of non-\nIndian race, ethnicity, or alienage were not subjected. \n106.  When workers complained about these unsafe and illegal conditions, Signal \ndemoted them, suspended them without pay, and/or threatened to deport them.  Some Indian \nworkers who complained about unsafe conditions were suspended for three days for \"safety \nviolations.\"  Workers of non-Indian race, ethnicity, or alienage were not treated this way. \n107.  Defendants' discriminatory treatment of Plaintiffs and other Indian workers was \nmotivated by racial, ethnic, and religious animus, as well as an animus against those of Indian \nnational origin. \nDefendants Continued to Mislead the Plaintiffs \nAbout the Terms of their Employment \n27 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 28 of 78\n108.  On numerous occasions during October, November, and December 2006, Burnett \nand Signal personnel met with workers who asked about the prospect of receiving green cards. \nDuring these meetings, Signal personnel were told by workers that the remaining Defendants and \nSignal personnel in India had promised that Signal would apply for and help the workers obtain \ngreen cards, and that the workers had paid as much as $25,000 for that opportunity. \n109.  Rather than tell the workers honestly that Signal had not applied for permanent \nresidency on their behalf and had no present intention to do so, Signal continued to deceive the \nworkers into believing that Signal would apply for and help them obtain permanent residency \nstatus.  Notably, in or about January 2007, Dewan and Burnett traveled to the man camp and, \nwith Signal employee John Sanders present, told Plaintiffs and other Indian workers that Signal \nwould provide each Indian worker, including Plaintiffs, with a green card. \n110.  Beginning before this meeting and continuing throughout 2007, Signal employees \ncommunicated and consulted with each other and with the remaining Defendants concerning \nwhat to tell workers, including Plaintiffs, about the status of their visas and green card \napplications. \nIll.  Signal also did nothing to address the fact that the Plaintiffs' temporary \nemployment at Signal (which Signal itself represented to the U.S. Department of Home1and \nSecurity, under penalty ofpetjury, would be completed \"within the ... year\") was not \neconomically justifiable in light of the crushing amounts of debt Plaintiffs incurred and the \nmandatory $35 per day deduction for room and board. \n112.  Before October 2006, shortly after the first workers (including Plaintiffs) arrived \nin Pascagoula, Signal personnelleamed that each worker had been required to pay well over the \nequivalent of$10,000 to Pol, Burnett, and Dewan. \n28 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 29 of 78\n113.  In internal correspondence and conversation, Signal personnel (including Signal \nexecutives) concluded that these \"recruitment fees\" were excessive and a root cause of \ndissatisfaction and low morale among the Indian workers.  Nevertheless, Signal did nothing to \nremedy the situation. \n114.  First, although Signal sent a letter to Dewan and Burnett requesting that they \nrefund half of the fees that they had received, Signal did not terminate its relationship with \nDewan or Burnett or impose any penalty or withhold any payment when those individuals \nrefused to comply.  In fact, Signal did nothing even after Burnett (i) asserted to Signal that \nDewan had refunded the workers' money, and (ii) furnished affidavits signed by workers \nattesting to the \"fact\" that they never paid any fees, both claims that Signal itself considered \nplainly false. \n115.  Second. despite believing that the fees being charged were unreasonable and were \ngenerating problems, Signal never demanded that Dewan or Burnett cease collecting such fees \nfrom new recruits who were still in India.  Indeed, Signal continued to hire workers, including \ncertain Plaintiffs, through Dewan and Burnett after it learned of the unreasonable fees that they \ncharged, effectively ratifying the conduct of the remaining Defendants. \n116.  Third. Signal did not itself refund the unreasonable fees charged by the remaining \nDefendants, nor did Signal offer any assistance to mitigate the cost or modify its contract with \nthe Defendants in which it had been agreed that neither Signal nor Global would shoulder any of \nthe \"recruitment fees\" for its Indian workers. \nIn an Attempt to Quell Rising Worker Dissatisfaction, Signal Sends Three Workers \nBack to India, One of Whom Attempts Suicide \n117.  By the spring of2007 (approximately three to four months after workers first \narrived), it became increasingly clear that the conditions at the Pascagoula man camp were \n29 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 30 of 78\nintolerable.  Workers began to consider ways to convince Signal to improve the conditions and \nsought outside advice from local churchgoers and attorneys. \n118.  In late February 2007, when Signal learned that certain workers had contacted a \nlawyer, Signal threatened to send the most vocal workers back to India.  Similarly, Dewan called \none vocal worker's wife in India and warned her to tell her husband to stop making trouble at \nSignal.  News of Dewan's call to India spread among the workers and substantially heightened \nPlaintiffs' fears that Defendants would retaliate, perhaps even with violence, against them and \ntheir families if they complained about or tried to leave the discriminatory and degrading \nconditions. \n119.  Signal escalated its pressure on the workers.  In a meeting with the workers, \nincluding Plaintiffs, on March 8, 2007, Signal management told them that Signal would fight \nback against any \"organizing\" efforts, and that Signal would not extend any of the workers' H-\n2B visas if a single worker took legal action against Signal. \n120.  On that same day, Signal decided to terminate and forcibly send back to India a \ngroup of the ostensible \"camp leaders\" and to do so in a way that would make an example out of \nthem and intimidate the other workers into remaining scared and compliant. \n121.  Early in the morning of March 9, 2007-when the workers for both the day and \nnight shifts were present at the camp-Signal locked the gate to the Pascagoula man camp, \nthereby blocking the only exit.  At approximately the same time, Signal camp coordinator Darrell \nSnyder and five security guards swept through the bunkhouses carrying pictures of the men \ntargeted for termination.  Because Mr. Snyder and the security guards could not differentiate the \nappearance of these Indian men, they accosted numerous workers to determine whether they \nwere the individuals shown in the pictures. \n30 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 31 of 78\n122.  By 6:00 a.m., Signal had identified several workers, taken them into \"custody\" in \na side room, and told them that they were fired and would be deported.  Distraught at what that \nmeant for him and his family, one of the workers slashed his wrists and attempted suicide. \n123.  By early afternoon, local media, religious advocates, and other individuals had \ngathered outside the camp gates to express their concern over the attempted suicide and the \nforced detention of the other men. \n124.  The incidents of March 9, 2007 caused great fear in each of the Plaintiffs.  Not \nonly were they afraid ofthe worsening tension among the workers, they were scared of what \nSignal would do to them if they raised concerns about conditions at the camp.  Plaintiffs \nbelieved, based on Signal's conduct, that protesting their plight would lead to arrest, \nimprisonment, bodily harm, and deportation back to India. \n125.  Indeed, by its conduct on March 8 and 9, 2007, Signal intentionally created a \nclimate of fear and intimidation in order to frighten the Plaintiffs and their coworkers into \ndropping their complaints about the man camp and their treatment at the hands of Defendants. \nSignal, Assisted by Burnett and Dewan, Used Fraudulent and \nCoercive Tactics to Keep Plaintiffs in the Pascagoula Camp \n126.  Following the March 9, 2007 incident, Signal used additional fraudulent and \ncoercive tactics to keep the workers, including Plaintiffs, under its control. \n127.  Later that month, Signal Senior Vice President Ron Schnoor addressed the entire \nPascagoula man camp about what had happened on March 9.  Schnoor used two tactics: \nfraudulent promises of long-term employment, and threats to send the workers back to India. \n128.  First, Schnoor assured the men that Signal would continue to employ them for the \n\"long term.\"  That assurance was demonstrably false at the time, given that Signal still had not \ndecided whether it would extend any ofthe workers beyond the initial ten-month visa period, and \n31 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 32 of 78\ngiven that Signal had already begun to evaluate the Pascagoula workers and had decided to fire \nand not apply for visa extensions for certain workers. \n129.  Second, Schnoor threatened the men, telling them that if anyone Indian worker \nfiled a lawsuit against Signal, Signal would refuse to extend any of the H-2B visas for any of the \nworkers and would therefore send all of them back to India.  Signal knew full well that this \nthreat would coerce the workers, including Plaintiffs, into staying at the camp, lest they rerum to \nIndia unable to pay their crushing debt. \n130.  Nevertheless, even given the threats and false promises, by March 2008, more \nthan three-quarters of the Indian workers in the Pascagoula camp had escaped from Signal. \nMany were terminated; others left of their own accord due to the low pay, abusive treatment, and \ndeplorable living conditions. \nDefendants Never Took Any Action to Fulfill Their Promises of Green Cards \n131.  At no point did Defendants ever apply for, or assist Plaintiffs in applying for, \npermanent residency, as promised.  Moreover, consistent with its never-failing effort to improve \nits bottom line by transferring as many costs associated with their employment as possible back \nto Plaintiffs, Signal never refunded any of the tens of thousands of dollars in \"recruitment fees\" \nPlaintiffs had paid in exchange for less than one year oflow-paid work.  None of the Plaintiffs \neamed enough money at Signal to make the exorbitant and debt-inducing \"recruitment fees\" \neven remotely worthwhile.  Moreover, Signal never compensated Plaintiffs in any way for the \nphysical, emotional, and psychological degradations inflicted upon them at the Pascagoula camp. \n132.  In short, Defendants' promises of employment-based green cards were entirely \ncontrived: \n32 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 33 of 78\na.  Defendants never filed or otherwise supported green card applications for Plaintiffs, \nor took any other steps toward assisting Plaintiffs with securing green cards; \nb.  Defendants told the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under penalty of perjury \nthat Signal's need for workers was temporary; \nc.  Signal has stated in court filings that it never intended to provide any workers with \ngreen cards, but rather with temporary H-2B visas; \nd.  Defendants segregated and confined Plaintiffs and other Indian workers to the man \ncamp because Defendants did not want Indian workers mixing with other members of \nthe Pascagoula community; and \ne.  Internal correspondence among Signal management in May 2006 shows that \"[a]1I \n[Signal is] doing now is bringing the workers in under the H2B program.\" \n133.  In line with Signal's original intention as expressed to the United States \nGovernment-but not to the Plaintiffs-to employ the workers temporarily, Plaintiffs were all \nterminated within a year and a half of arriving in Pascagoula, or left to escape the horrid \nconditions in the Pascagoula man camp. \nMalvern Burnett Purported to Act as Attorney to Plaintiffs, \nBut In Reality Was Working Solely on Behalf ofD  efendants \n134.  At all relevant times, Burnett had an attorney-client relationship with each \nPlaintiff and, indeed, each Indian worker employed by Signal, for purposes of immigration issues \nand each Plaintiffs' work for Signal. \n\\35.  Burnett prepared the immigration forms required for Plaintiffs to apply for H-2B \nstatus. In completing those fonns, Burnett represented to the U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity, under penalty of perjury, that the Plaintiffs would stay in the United States only \ntemporarily, returning to India \"within the coming year.\" At the same time Burnett was \n33 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 34 of 78\nsubmitting those forms, he was affirmatively telling the workers, including Plaintiffs, that they \nwould be eligible for permanent residency, and that he would assist them in applying for green \ncards. \n136.  Further, Burnett learned that, after they arrived in the United States, the workers, \nincluding Plaintiffs, asked Signal personnel when they could expect to receive green cards. After \nlearning this, Burnett did nothing to correct his clients' misimpression. \n13 7.  To further his deception, Burnett concealed from Plaintiffs where his true \nloyalties lay. As noted above, by mid-2006 Burnett had entered into an attorney-client \nrelationship with Signal for the broad purpose of applying for and obtaining lawful status for \nIndian workers to come to the United States. Later, in 2007, Signal and Burnett entered into a \nwritten Retainer Agreement memorializing the arrangement as it had been operating-namely that \nBurnett would \"represent you [Signal] in the matter of H-2B Visa extensions for MS and TX\" on \nimmigration matters at zero cost while the fees for his work on behalf of Signal were to be taken \nfrom the Indian workers, including Plaintiffs. \n138.  Burnett never disclosed his attorney-client relationship or payment arrangement \nwith Signal to the Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, much less received their waiver of the \nconflict of interest it caused. \n139.  Burnett also entered into an attorney-client relationship with Dewan and Pol, \nstarting no later than mid-2006. Burnett never disclosed this attorney-client relationship with Pol \nand Dewan to the Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, much less received their approval for it. \n140.  Burnett also had a \"Multilateral Business Agreement\" with Dewan and Pol, for \nthe broad purpose of recruiting Indian workers to come to the United States. Burnett never \n34 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 35 of 78\ndisclosed this \"Multilateral Business Agreement\" to the Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, \nmuch less received their approval for it. \n141.  One incident illustrative of the contempt with which Burnett viewed his Indian \nclients. On December 16, 2006, Burnett sent an email to Dewan and Pol regarding Pravin Kumar \nN. Patel, a Signal worker and client of Burnett. Patel had stopped payment on a check to Burnett. \nBurnett told Dewan and Pol to ensure that \"the idiot\" Patel restore the payment and threatened to \nhave Patel's visa \"mysteriously\" revoked if Patel did not pay.  Later in the email, Burnett \nreferred to all the Indian workers, who were his clients, as \"'the idiots\" and speculated about \nwhether he should threaten them with \"immediate deportation\" in order to prevent them from \nstopping payment on future checks. \n142.  Burnett also forwarded emails he received from his Indian worker clients to \nDewan.  Burnett forwarded these attorney-client protected communications without permission \nfrom his clients, the workers. \n143.  Such appalling behavior violates not only the Mississippi Rules of Professional \nConduct for attorneys, but basic notions ofloyalty, propriety, and honesty. \nDefendants' Conduct Violated Congress's Clear Prohibition Against Human Trafficking \n144.  In 2000, Congress enacted the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act \n(\"TVPA\") to provide enhanced legal protections for victims of human trafficking and to \nsupplement existing forms of relief.  Congress specifically included protections for persons \nforced to work out of fear of serious harm, physical restraint, abuse of the legal process, or \nthreats of the same. \n145.  According to House Report 106-939, the new statute was \"intended to address the \nincreasingly subtle methods of traffickers who place their victims in modem-day slavery, such as \n35 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 36 of 78\nwhere traffickers threaten harm to third persons, restrain their victims without physical violence \nor injury, or threaten dire consequences by means other than overt violence.\"  In particular, \nCongress clarified that the statute covered \"a broad array of harms, including both physical and \nnonphysical,\" and could apply where the perpetrator \"intentionally caus[ed] the victim to believe \nthat her family [would] face harms such as banishment, starvation, or bankruptcy in their home \ncountry.\" \n146.  In 2003, Congress amended the statute to permit individual victims of trafficking \nto bring civil claims against their traffickers.  Plaintiffs do so here.  Plaintiffs also bring claims \nfor violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent \nmisrepresentation, and breach of contract. \nPlaintifft Each Relied on the Defendants' Representations \n147.  Each of the Plaintiffs relied upon Defendants' promises of permanent residency in \nthe United States, steady work, and lucrative wages.  They attended seminars led by Sachin \nDewan, Kurella Rao, and Malvern Burnett and their associates in which Plaintiffs were promised \ngreen cards within about 18 months. \n148.  Plaintiffs relied on this and other promises.  They would not have liquidated their \nsavings, sold assets, incurred substantial debt, forsaken other employment opportunities, or \nagreed to work for Signal in the absence of such falsehoods.  Furthermore, each of the Plaintiffs \npaid substantially more than the five or six lakh rupees that Defendants told them this \nopportunity would cost, including fees for skills tests and medical examinations, expenses for \ntravel across India and to the United States, interest costs for borrowed funds, lost work \nopportunities, additional costs for family members to obtain green cards, added costs for the H· \n2B visas, and other expenses. \n36 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 37 of 78\n149.  Based on their fear of financial ruin without any hope of paying back their debts, \nPlaintiffs each continued to pay Defendants for the promised opportunities in the United States, \neven when Defendants repeatedly broke their promises.  When they arrived in the United States, \neach of the Plaintiffs was forced to continue working for Signal under difficult and dangerous \nconditions.  Each of them lived in the bunkhouses described above and suffered the lack of \nprivacy, inedible food, and fmancial cost that that entailed.  Each of them also suffered the \ndiscriminatory and dangerous work conditions imposed by Signal, with inflated costs of tools \nand safety equipment deducted from their pay.  Based on their fear of mistreatment and abuse by \nSignal, their need to repay the substantial debt they had incurred, their fear that Signal would \nconfiscate even more hard-earned wages, and their fear that Defendants would take adverse \nimmigration action against them, the Plaintiffs felt compelled to continue working at Signal. \nVarghese Kurisinkal Devassy \n150.  In or about 2003, while living in Kerala, India, Varghese Kurisinkal Devassy saw \nan advertisement in a Malayalam newspaper from Dewan Consultants for an opportunity for \nskilled workers and their families to obtain permanent immigrant visas to the United States. \n151.  In response to the ad, Devassy attended a seminar conducted largely in Hindi and \nEnglish led by Sachin Dewan, Kurella Rao, Malvern Burnett and their associates.  At the \nseminar, the speakers described an opportunity to work at a shipyard in the United States and \ngain permanent residence there for the workers and their families.  They explained that the cost \nwas five lakh rupees (the equivalent of approximately $11,000 in January 2004), payable in three \ninstallments.  They said that the process would take approximately 18 months, with a labor \ncertification to be approved by the U.S. Government within six to nine months. \n37 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 38 of 78\n152.  Based on these promises, Devassy agreed to pay the first installment.  He was also \nrequired to take-and pay for-a practical skills test and a medical examination, both of which \nhe passed. \n153.  Approximately 18 months after Devassy paid his first installment, Devassy still \nhad not received his labor certification, let alone a green card.  When Devassy expressed his \nconcern, Dewan told Devassy that the delay was beyond his control and that he had to wait.  In \nor about June 2005, Dewan informed Devassy that his labor certification had been approved and \ninstructed him to prepare the second installment.  When Devassy arrived to obtain his labor \ncertification, he was told that his certification had been misplaced, but that he still must pay at \nleast a portion of the second installment at that time. \n154.  In or about October 2006, Dewan informed Devassy that he could travel to the \nUnited States on a H-2B visa to work for Signal while the green card was being processed.  He \nwas told that Signal would pay for his meals and accommodations in the United States.  Dewan \ntold Devassy that he would have to travel to Chennai at his own expense to take a practical skills \ntest for Signal, which he again passed. \n155.  Devassy also was required to pay additional fees to attend an interview at the U.S. \nconsulate in Chennai, India., which took place in or about November 2006.  Before his interview, \nDevassy met with Dewan, who instructed him to falsely answer questions from consular officials \nabout the money he had paid to Dewan and the promises made by Dewan and other Defendants. \nAfter the interview, the consular official told Devassy that his passport would be sent to Dewan. \n156.  Dewan subsequently told Devassy that he would have to travel to Mumbai, where \nhe would pay the third installment and then leave for the United States.  Third installment \nincluded additional payments to Michael Pol, who Devassy did not know. \n38 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 39 of 78\n157.  Once in Mumbai, Devassy and dozens of others met at Dewan's office where they \nwere asked to sign various documents in English, including a document falsely stating that he \nhad not paid any money to Dewan Consultants for the opportunity.  Only after Devassy signed \nthe documents and paid the third installment was he given his passport and his plane ticket.  In \nthe end, he paid significantly more ~an the five lakh rupees that Dewan had initially promised, \nusing money from his savings, sales of his wife's jewelry, and loans from his family. \n158.  Devassy arrived at Signal's labor camp in Pascagoula, Mississippi on or around \nNovember 27, 2006.  Despite poor and unsanitary living conditions at the j:amp and dangerous \nand discriminatory working conditions, Devassy was told that if he tried to leave, he would be \ndeported. \nGeorge Chacko Edavazhickal \n159.  George Chacko Edavazhickal is a structural fitter from the state of Kerala in \nIndia.  He learned of Defendants' offer to provide green cards and steady employment in or \narolmd December 2003 from an advertisement in a local Malayalam newspaper.  At a seminar \nled in English and Hindi by Sachin Dewan, Edavazhickallearned that Indo-Amerisoft was \nrecruiting workers for a shipyard on the American Gulf Coast.  The company would pay good \nwages and would provide housing and food, as well as a green card for permanent residence. \n160.  For this opportunity, the workers would pay five lakh rupees, with the first \ninstallment due immediately.  He later learned that a green card for each farnily member would \ncost an additional $1500, although ifhe waited, it would cost $5000 per family member. \nEdavazhickal agreed to these terms based on Defendants' promises.  To pay the fees, \nEdavazhickal used up his savings and borrowed money from his relatives and a bank. \nUltimately, Edavazhickal paid significantly more than the five lakh rupees that Defendants \n39 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 40 of 78\ninitially represented, including payments for his wife and two children to receive green cards.  In \naddition, Defendants raised the agreed-upon fees once Edavazhickal had already committed. \n161.  In or around late 2006, Defendants informed Edavazhickal that he could travel to \nthe United States to work for Signal International on a temporary work visa and that Signal \nwould apply for a green card on his behalf.  He traveled to Chennai at his own expense for a \nskills test and for the interview with consular officials. \n162.  In or around November 2006, he traveled to Dewan's office in Mumbai at his \nown expense to collect his stamped passport and his plane ticket to the United States.  Dewan \nrequired that Edavazhickal pay the final installment before Dewan would return his passport and \nprovide the ticket. \n163.  When he arrived at the Pascagoula, Mississippi facility, Edavazhickal was \nappalled by the living conditions.  There was no privacy, long lines for the bathrooms and pay \nphones, and terrible food.  Frequently, he could not eat the lunch he brought from the man camp, \nsince it spoiled quickly, and he would have to survive on only a single piece of fruit for the entire \nday. \n164.  Signal exposed the Indian workers, including Edavazhickal, to unsafe conditions \nthat the non-Indian workers did not have to endure.  For example, Signal did not give \nEdavazhickal proper safety equipment, such as a safety harness when working off the ground. \nNumerous times, Edavazhickal and Indian workers were sent into the hull of the ship for repairs \nwith little ventilation or light, while non-Indian workers worked on the surface of the ship. \nSignal supervisors knew that Edavazhickal and the Indian workers would generally not talk back \nto them or complain because of the language barrier and because they were desperate to keep \ntheir jobs, and the supervisors took advantage of that. \n40 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 41 of 78\n165.  Edavazhickal soon arranged for a group of the Indian workers to attend the local \nCatholic Church.  The Catholic workers would speak about their situation at Signal with other \ncongregants, one of whom contacted an attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center.  The \nattorney then wrote a letter to Signal management on February 26, 2007 demanding that they \nfulfill their promises to the Indian workers.  Signal employee John Sanders believed that \nEdavazhickal was a leader of the Catholic group that contacted the attorneys, so he kept a close \nwatch on Edavazhickal and warned him not to talk to outsiders. \n166.  In early March 2007, Signal management detained several workers and threatened \nto fire and deport them, triggering one of them to attempt suicide.  Edavazhickal became \nconcerned about his own safety, since he did not know what Signal management was capable of \ndoing to him.  In or about late March, 2007, Edavazhickal returned to the camp and learned that \nSanders was looking for him.  Because he believed that he would detained and deported, \nEdavazhickal gathered his belongings and fled. \n167.  After taking a series of jobs in different states, Edavazhickal returned to India in \nor about October 2007 to take care of his ailing wife.  He has struggled to payoff the debts \nincurred as a result of Defendants' recruitment scheme, but he has been unable to do so tq date. \nPrasad Kunju Kunju \n168.  In or about 2003, Prasad Kunju Kunju saw an advertisement from Dewan \nConsultants in the United Arab Emirates for an opportunity to work in the United States and to \nobtain a green card. He attended the seminar described in the advertisement.  Relying on the \npromises made in the advertisement and the seminar, Kunju decided to participate in the program \nand made his first installment payment. \n41 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 42 of 78\n169.  Kunju did not receive either a labor certification or a green card within 18 \nmonths, as promised by Defendants. In 2006, Kunju learned that Dewan was advertising for \nIndian workers to travel to the United States on temporary visas to work with Signal.  Because he \nneeded to pay back his debts and because Dewan assured him that it would not affect his green \ncard, Kunju took leave from his job in Dubai and returned to India at his own expense in or \naround October 2006 in order to pursue this opportunity.  He was asked to take a skills test with \nrepresentatives from Signal.  At this test, Kunju was assured by Defendants that they would \nprovide him with both an H-2B visa and a green card. \n170.  In or around late 2006, Kunju attended an interview at the U.S. consulate in \nChennai.  Before the interview, Dewan warned Kunju not to tell the consulate how much he had \npaid during the visa/green card process. He agreed not to do so. \n171.  In or around December 2006, Kunju made his third installment payment at \nDewan's office in Mumbai.  Again, Dewan made it clear that participants would not get their \npassports back unless they had paid the full amount requested. Kunju and the other participants \nalso were forced to turn over all of their documents relating to their previous agreements with \nDefendants and to sign documents written in English that they did not understand.  After Kunju \nmade his final payments and signed the documents, he boarded a flight to the United States on or \naround December 17, 2006. \n172.  Kunju was forced to live in the same overcrowded, unsanitary conditions as the \nother Indian workers at the Pascagoula, Mississippi camp.  He was also forced to work deep \ninside the hulls of ships with little light, no fresh air, and very little ventilation.  Kunju and the \nother Indian workers were also frequently yelled at and threatened with deportation by Signal \nemployees. \n42 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 43 of 78\n173.  Nevertheless, Kunju felt compelled to stay with Signal because of his crushing \ndebts.  Defendants continued to promise Kunju and the Indian workers that the conditions would \nimprove and that their green cards were being processed.  In or around January and February \n2008, Rao collected additional fees from Kunju, purportedly to process his green card. \n174.  In or around the end of December 2008, Kunju was dismissed from Signal, which \nsent him a letter stating that there was no more work to be done and that his visa was no longer \nrenewable.  After leaving Signal, Kunju was unemployed for almost a year because he did not \nhave authorization to work. \n175.  In order to pursue this \"opportunity\" for permanent residency in the United States, \nKunju was forced to expend significantly more than the five lakh rupees that Defendants had \nclaimed it would cost him.  He obtained the money by borrowing from friends, banks and \nmoneylenders.  He has foregone other opportunities for employment and endured significant \nperiods of unemployment as a result of Defendants' recruitment schemes. \nAmpattu Varughese Mathew \n176.  In October or November of2003, Mathew was on leave from work and living at \nhis home in Kerala, India when he read an advertisement placed by Dewan Consultants \ndescribing a new immigration rule that would allow fitters and welders to work in, and bring \ntheir families to, the United States. \n177.  Mathew attended the preliminary interview in Cochin and learned that the \nopportunity was with lndo-Amerisoft, and that it would cost him approximately five lakh rupees, \nto be paid in three installments.  Relying on Dewan's promises, Mathew decided to participate in \nthe opportunity, and he signed various agreements written in English.  Mathew also attended, \nand passed, a welding test that cost him additional money. \n43 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 44 of 78\n178.  Mathew obtained the money to pay Defendants by taking out loans from private \nblademen. \n179.  There was no progress on the labor certification throughout 2004.  In 2005, with \nno end to the delay in sight, and with Dewan's approval, Mathew took a job in Qatar while he \nwaited for his labor certification to be processed. \n180.  In or around January 2006, Mathew was informed that his labor certification had \nbeen approved, and he subsequently paid the second installment with money borrowed from \nblademen.  Dewan stated that the green card processing would be complete in approximately six \nmonths. \n181.  In or around August 2006, Dewan gave Mathew the option of going to the United \nStates on a temporary H-2B visa while his green card processing was still pending.  In order to \npayoff his debts, Mathew decided to participate and, in or around September 2006,  resigned \nfrom his job in Qatar.  Upon returning to India, Dewan told Mathew that the H-2B visa would \nrequire an additional payment.  Dewan also informed Mathew that he would have to go to \nChennai for an interview at the U.S. consulate. \n182.  In or around October 2006, before his consulate interview, Mathew attended a \nmeeting with Defendants in which Mathew took, and passed, a skills test given by Signal. \nDewan informed Mathew that Signal would now be processing the green card instead of Indo \nAmerisoft.  Dewan also warned Mathew to not tell the consulate that they had paid any more \nthan 35,000 rupees or that they were recruited by an agent.  Mathew passed his consulate \ninterview and was told that Dewan would hold his passport until he made the third installment \npayment. \n44 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 45 of 78\n183.  In or around November 2006, Mathew was informed that his plane tickets to the \nUnited States were ready.  Mathew first travelled to Dewan's Mumbai office where he made the \nthird installment payment and paid the additional H-2B visa fee. To raise the money necessary \nfor these payments, Mathew sold his family's house. He also was required to sign various \ndocuments. Mathew was told that ifhe took the time to read the documents, he would miss his \nflight and not be able to go to the United States.  Only after signing all of the documents did \nDewan return Mathew's passport. Dewan also demanded that Mathew return all of the \ndocuments he had retained from the green card/visa process.  Mathew arrived in the United \nStates in or about November 2006. \n184.  At Signal's Mississippi camp, Varghese suffered the same overcrowded, \nunsanitary conditions as the other Indian workers.  The camp itself was fenced in and no visitors \nwere allowed inside the camp.  In fact, in or about December 2007, after Mathew underwent an \noperation for a hernia that he developed while at Signal, Signal prohibited Mathew's brother and \nchurch friends from visiting him. \n185.  Mathew also was forced to work on tasks that were dangerous and unclean.  On \none occasion, when Mathew voiced his concerns that a task he had been assigned was dangerous, \nMathew was insulted by the foreman, who said he could not complete the task because Indians . \nwere weak.  On other occasions, when refusing to do unsafe work or asking for additional help, \nMathew was punished with suspensions or wage reductions. \n186.  Despite all this, Mathew felt compelled to stay at Signal because he had invested \nsuch a large sum of money to participate in this program-well over the originally discussed five \nlakh rupees.  Mathew also did not want to become an illegal immigrant in the United States. \nFurther, Defendants claimed that they were still working to process Mathew's green card, and \n45 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 46 of 78\ncollected additional fees from him on more than one occasion after arriving in the United States, \npurportedly for additional work on his green card. \n187.  In or around April 2008, Mathew could no longer bear the situation at Signal and \nfled. \nAntony Sajan Oottuparambil Michael \n188.  In 2003, Michael was working in Cochin as a ship fitter when he saw an \nadvertisement for an opportunity to work in the United States and to obtain a green card with \nIndo-Amerisoft.  Calling the number listed on the advertisement, Dewan informed Michael that \nthis opportunity would cost approximately six lakh rupees over an 18-month period. \n189.  Relying on the promises made by Defendants in the advertisement and seminar, \nMichael decided to participate in the program and made his first installment payment.  After \npassing a skills test, Michael was asked to sign documents written in English that he could not \nread. \n190.  After not hearing from them for a lengthy period, Michaei contacted Defendants, \nwho advised him to prepare his next installment payment.  They also advised him to move \nforward with this opportunity because they would not return his money.  Michael made the \nsecond installment payment and was again asked to sign paperwork written in English that he did \nnot understand. \n191.  In 2006, Dewan contacted Michael and informed him about the opportunity to \nwork for Signal in the United States under a H-2B visa.  Once in the United States, Michael \nwould receive his green card.  Dewan also explained that Michael would have to interview with \nthe U.S. consulate in Chennai in order to participate in this opportunity. \n46 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 47 of 78\n192.  On or about November 7, 2006, Michael travelled to Chennai.  Before the \nconsulate interview, Dewan warned Michael not to tell the consulate how much he had paid \nduring the visa/green card process.  Instead, if asked, he should say that he only paid 35,000 \nrupees.  Following the consulate interview, which Michael passed, the consulate took his \npassport, which was later sent to Dewan Consultants. \n193.  On or about November 21, 2006, the Defendants told Michael that his visa had \nbeen approved and that he should have his third installment payment ready on the day of his \nflight.  Michael delayed his departure date because he did not yet have enough money for the \nthird installment.  As a result, Michael was informed that he would be fined approximately 4,500 \nrupees for the date change. \n194.  On or about December 6, 2006, Michael made the final installment payment at \nDewan's Mumbai office.  The Defendants also required Michael to return documents generated \nduring the recruiting process.  Any participants who refused were told that their passports would \nbe destroyed.  Michael arrived in the United States on or around December 7, 2006. \n195.  In order to pursue this \"opportunity\" for permanent residency in the United States \nand obtain money for the installment payments, Michael spent his savings, sold his wife's and \nsisters' gold wedding ornaments, and borrowed money from a bank using his aunt's gold \nwedding ornaments as collateral. \n196.  At Signal's Mississippi camp, Michael was forced to live in the same cramped, \ndepressing, and unsanitary conditions as the other Indian workers.  Michael also was forced to do \ndangerous work.  Nevertheless, Michael felt compelled to stay at Signal because of his depleted \nsavings and his desire to provide a better life for his family.  Additionally, Defendants continued \nto promise that they were processing Michael's visa extensions and green cards. \n47 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 48 of 78\n197.  However, in or around November 2008, Signal informed Michael that there \nwould soon be no more work left and that they would be sending him back to India.  Still \ndesperate to obtain the green card he had been promised, on or around December 26, 2008, \nMichael left the Signal camp soon before he was scheduled to return to India.  Since then, \nMichael has been in and out of work and is currently unemployed.  His family is still in India. \nSivan Raghavan \n198.  In or around December 2003, Raghavan was working as a fabrication foreman in \nDubai, United Arab Emirates when he saw an advertisement to obtain a U.S. green card. \n199.  Raghavan attended a preliminary interview in Dubai, where Dewan explained that \nworkers would have the opportunity to work in the United States and get a green card for \nthemselves and their families.  The entire process would cost approximately 45,000 dirhams \n(approximately $12,250 USD in 2004 exchange rates) and take no more than 18 months. \nRelying on these promises, Raghavan decided to participate, and he paid a non-refundable entry \nfee in or around January 2004.  To obtain the money for this payment, Raghavan borrowed \nmoney from his brother and sister-in-law, who in tum had to borrow the money from a bank and \na blade company at significant interest rates. \n200.  At the meeting, the Defendants informed Raghavan that Indo-Amerisoft would \nprovide the workers with lawful immigration status and positions in the U.S. at a shipyard on the \nGulf Coast.  They also told him that he would receive his labor certification in six to nine months \nand a green card in no more than 18 months after that.  Dewan also explained that there would be \nadditional costs for family members to participate. \n201.  In or around February 2005, Dewan informed Raghavan that his labor \ncertification was ready and that his second installment payment was due.  However, the green \n48 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 49 of 78\ncard did not come through as Dewan had promised.  During this time, Raghavan was offered a \nnumber of promotions and a new job in India, but on Dewan's advise he turned them down \nbecause he was afraid that it would compromise his chances of emigrating to the United States. \nAdditionally, an employer in the United Arab Emirates offered to renew Raghavan's visa ifhe \nstayed with the company for three years.  However, Dewan explained that the green card process \nwould only take three or four months, so Raghavan should resign his current job.  Relying on \nDewan's statement, Raghavan quit his job in or around Mayor June 2006. \n202.  In mid-2006, Defendants informed Raghavan that they were sending workers to \nthe United States to work for Signal on H-2B visas.  Dewan explained that the H-2B visa was \ntemporary, lasting only nine months, but that it would be converted into a permanent green card. \nTo participate, Raghavan would be required to pay an additional fee. \n203.  Relying on Dewan's promises of a green card, and already heavily invested in \nDewan's recruitment scheme, Raghavan had little choice but to do as Dewan said.  Raghavan \nattended an interview and skills test with Signal, which he passed.  Defendants also instructed \nthat Raghavan would have to pay a fee to the U.S. consulate and attend an interview there. \nDewan instructed him to tell the consulate, if asked, that he had not paid to participate in the \nprogram and that he intended to return to India when the visa expired.  Following the consulate \ninterview, the consulate took his passport, which was later sent to Dewan. \n204.  In or around November 2006, Raghavan went to Dewan's office in Mumbai. \nUpon his arrival, Raghavan was required to take, and pay for, a medical exam.  He then went to \nthe Defendants' office and paid the remainder of his outstanding balance, including the third \ninstallment, H-2B additional visa fee, and travel costs.  To obtain the money for this large \npayment, Raghavan obtained a bank loan, using his family'S home, a separate piece ofland, and \n49 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 50 of 78\nhis wife's wedding gold as collateral.  Only after Raghavan paid, Dewan returned Raghavan's \npassport.  Dewan also asked Raghavan to return all of the documents he had received during the \ngreen card process.  Raghavan turned over his documents and Dewan immediately threw them \naway.  On or around November 26, 2006, Raghavan flew from Mumbai to the United States. \n205.  Once in the United States, Raghavan was forced to live in the same overcrowded \nand unsanitary conditions as the other Indian workers at the Pascagoula, Mississippi camp. \nDuring his time at the camp, Raghavan developed rashes from the living conditions and had to \ngo to the hospital twice, at his own expense. \n206.  Despite the circumstances, Raghavan felt compelled to stay at Signal because he \nwas deep in debt and had risked his family's fmancial future on this \"opportunity.\"  Further, \nDefendants continued to promise that Raghavan's green card was being processed.  Defendants \nalso claimed that they would process Raghavan's visa extension and green card, collecting \nadditional payments from Raghavan while he was in the United States. \n207.  In or around September 2007, Raghavan finally lost faith in the Defendants' \npromises and escaped the Pascagoula man camp.  In or around October 2008, Raghavan was \narrested and jailed for approximately 70 days for working without a visa.  After being released \nfrom jail, Raghavan was unemployed for 18 months and forced to live at a charitable \norganization for fourteen of those months. \nVijayanair Sankarapillai \n208.  In or around December 2003, Sankarapillai was working as a welder in Abu \nDhabi, United Arab Emirates when he saw an advertisement for an opportunity for a green card \nand a permanent job in the United States.  In response to the ad, Sankarapillai travelled to \nDewan's office in Dubai.  Dewan explained that the opportunity was for a permanent job in the \n50 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 51 of 78\nUnited States and a green card for Sankarapillai and his family.  Sachin also stated that this \nopportunity would cost about 45,000 dirhams (approximately $12,250 USD in 2004). \n209.  Since Sankarapillai was hesitant about participating in the program, Defendants \nconvinced him to attend a meeting in or around late December 2003 in Abu Dhabi.  At this \nmeeting, Defendants stated that they would be able to process Sankarapillai' s green card in 18 \nmonths. \n210.  Relying on Defendants' promises, Sankarapillai decided to participate in the \nprogram and made the first installment payment in January and February 2004.  Sankarapillai \nobtained the money for the first installment from his savings and from a loan. \n2!!.  In or around October 2004, Sankarapillai received a letter from Defendants stating \nthat there were delays with the green card processing, but that the green card would still be \nprocessed.  Sankarapillai attempted to withdraw from the recruitment program on more than one \noccasion.  The Defendants told him to wait because it was not possible to cancel the process once \nit had started and that his money would not be refunded. \n2!2.  In or around February 2006, Dewan informed Sankarapillai that his labor \ncertification was ready and that it was time to pay the second installment.  Sankarapillai refused \nto pay the second installment until he saw proof that his labor certification had been issued. \nDefendants explained that the paperwork had been lost because of Hurricane Katrina, but that \nSankarapillai should not worry.  However, Sankarapillai refused to pay the second installment \nuntil he saw the certification. \n213.  In or about November of 2006, Defendants told Sankarapillai to take a welding \ntest in Chennai.  After passing the test, Sankarapillai met with Dewan and was instructed to \n51 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 52 of 78\nattend an interview at the United States Consulate.  Sankarapillai was told he would have to pay \nan additional fee for this interview. \n214.  In or around November 2006, Sankarapillai attended his consulate interview. \nBefore the interview, Dewan instructed Sankarapillai not to mention the payments he had made \nto the Defendants.  Sankarapillai followed Dewan's instructions.  Following the interview, the \nconsular official took his passport and later sent it to Dewan. \n215.  Dewan informed Sankarapillai that he would only return Sankarapillai's passport \nonce he paid the final fees and expenses.  At Sankarapillai's request, Dewan sent him a copy of \nthe visa.  This was when Sankarapillai first learned that he would be working for Signal under a \nH-2B visa rather than a green card.  Dewan told Sankarapillai that Signal, and not Indo \nAmerisoft, would be processing his green card.  Upon seeing the visa, Sankarapillai expressed \nconcern that it expired in nine months.  Dewan assured Sankarapillai that he would have a \npermanent job and a green card. \n216.  Without his passport, Sankarapillai would be unable to return to his job in Abu \nDhabi.  Further, Sankarapillai had already paid a significant amount of money.  Thus, \nSankarapillai felt compelled to continue the process with the Defendants.  On or around \nDecember 2006, Sankarapillai went to Dewan's office in Mumbai and paid the outstanding \nbalance.  Sankarapillai obtained the money by taking out a bank loan, with his house as \ncollateral, and borrowing money from friends.  Dewan insisted that Sankarapillai turn over any \ndocuments generated during the process with the Defendants.  Dewan also required Sankarapillai \nto sign a document written in English, without giving Sankarapillai the opportunity to review or \nunderstand it.  Only after all of this was done did Dewan give Sankarapillai his passport and \nairplane tickets.  Sankarapillai left India for the United States on or around December 7, 2006. \n52 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 53 of 78\n217.  At Signal's Mississippi camp, Sankarapillai was forced to live in the same \ncongested and uncomfortable conditions as the other Indian workers.  A Signal employee told \nSankarapillai that he and the Indian workers could not live outside of the camp because Signal \nhad to recoup the money it had spent building the trailers.  Sankarapillai also was forced to \nperfOlTIl dangerous tasks.  For example, Sankarapillai once experienced problems breathing after \nbeing tasked to weld in a location without sufficient ventilation.  The foreman ignored \nSankarapillai when he raised these concerns. \n218.  Despite these circumstances, Sankarapillai felt compelled to stay with Signal \nbecause of his significant financial troubles caused by Defendants.  Besides, Defendants \ncontinued to promise that they would process his visa extension and green card.  However, in or \naround May 2007, Sankarapillai could no longer bear working for Signal and left. \nAni! Scaria \n219.  Anil Scaria is a Malayalam-speaking welder from the state of Kerala in India.  He \nleamed of Defendants' offer to provide green cards and steady employment in or around \nDecember 2003 from an advertisement in a local Malayalam newspaper.  At a seminar led in \nEnglish and Hindi by Sachin Dewan and Malvern Bumett, Scaria learned that Indo-Amerisoft \nwas recruiting workers for a shipyard on the American Gulf Coast.  Dewan and Burnett promised \nthat he would receive his labor certification in nine months and would be ready to leave for the \nUnited States with a green card within 18 months with his wife and children.  Scaria was told \nthat this opportunity would cost him six lakh rupees, plus the cost of a plane ticket. \n220.  When the labor certification did not arrive in nine months and the green card was \nnot ready in 18 months, Scaria demanded his money back from Dewan.  Dewan refused, saying \n53 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 54 of 78\nthat he had already spent the money on processing the documents.  He encouraged Scaria to \ncontinue to wait.  Because Scaria had already invested so much money, he had little choice. \n221.  In or about February 2006, Dewan informed Scaria that his labor certification had \nbeen completed and that he must sign papers and pay the second installment.  At the time, Scaria \nwas working in Qatar, but Dewan refused to send the papers to Scaria there. Instead, Dewan \ninsisted that Scaria return to India.  So that he would not lose his investment, Scaria was forced \nto quit his job in Qatar and return to Kerala.  Defendants told him that the green cards would be \nready within six months and that he should not leave India in the interim.  Scaria did as he was \ntold and as a result was unemployed for several months.  In or around September 2006, Scaria \ninformed Dewan that he had ajob opportunity in the Persian Gulf.  However, Dewan told him \nnot to take the job because he would be leaving for the United States imminently. \n222.  Shortly thereafter, Scaria saw an advertisement from Dewan Consulting stating · \nthat there was a temporary job opportunity in the United States that would lead to permanent \nresidency.  Scaria contacted Dewan, demanding to know why others were being recruited while \nthe promises to him had not been fulfilled.  Dewan told him that he could have one of these \npositions if he passed a skills test.  Dewan told him that he would be working for Signal \nInternational making $18 per hour and that Signal would process his green card. However, he \nwould have to pay an additional three lakh rupees.  Scaria traveled to Chennai at his own \nexpense for the skills test and then returned there again for his consular interview.  Dewan told \nhim to lie about how much he had paid for the job opportunity. \n223.  In or around December 2006, Scaria learned that his visa was ready.  He traveled \nto Mumbai, where Dewan confiscated the documents relating to their agreements.  Dewan made \nhim sign various papers, all in English, but Dewan would not explain what they were.  Scaria \n54 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 55 of 78\npaid the final installment to Dewan before receiving his passport and plane ticket.  In the end, . \nScaria paid more than the six lakh rupees that Defendants had advertised.  He was able to pay his \nfees and costs by depleting his savings from overseas jobs, selling his wife's gold, and taking out \nloans with double-digit interest per month. \n224.  Soon after he arrived at Signal's Pascagoula, Mississippi facility in or around \nDecember 2006, Scaria wanted to return home to India. The living conditions were terrible, and \nhe was not being paid the full $18 per hour that he was promised.  He was forced to pay for his \ntools and gloves at exorbitant rates, as well as for his food and accommodations.  The work was \ndangerous, and he had to receive medical treatment for smoke inhalation when forced to work \nwith inadequate safety equipment in a poorly ventilated area.  However, because of his debt, and \nthe ongoing promises that Defendants would get him a green card, he had little choice but to \nstay. \n225.  In or about November 2007, Scaria learned that his father was very ill in India, \nand he asked Signal if he could return to India to see him.  Signal refused, giving no reason.  His \nfather died three days later.  Again, Signal refused to allow him time off to travel to India for the \nfuneral. \n226.  Scaria remained at Signal because of their ongoing promises to get him and his \nfamily green cards, but he finally escaped Signal in or around March 2008.  He has had great \nfinancial difficulties as a result of Defendants' false promises, and he remains in debt. \nMandeep Singh \n227.  In or around 2004, Singh was living in his native village in the Indian state of \nPunjab when he saw an advertisement from Dewan Consulting.  The advertisement sought to \n55 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 56 of 78\nrecruit skilled workers to travel to the United States to work and obtain a green card for \npermanent residency. \n228.  Interested in the opportunity, Mr. Singh attended a meeting at Dewan's offices. \nDewan informed Singh and the other recruits present that, in exchange for six lakh rupees (more \nthan $13,000 USD in 2004 exchange rates) paid in three installments, he would receive a green \ncard for permanent residency in the United States.  Dewan informed Singh that he would work \nfor Indo-Amerisoft, which Singh believed to be a shipping company.  Dewan promised that the \nentire process would take approximately 18 months.  Singh agreed and, borrowing money from \nhis family, paid the first installment. \n229.  In or around January 2006, approximately two years after he paid the first \ninstallment, Dewan informed Singh that his labor certification had been approved by the \nDepartment of Labor and that the second installment was now due.  Singh again paid the second \ninstallment from money borrowed from his family. \n230.  In or around 2007, Dewan informed Singh that he would have to travel at his own \nexpense for an interview at the U.S. embassy.  Dewan instructed Singh not to discuss the money \nthat he had paid for the green card with the embassy officials.  Singh agreed because he could \nnot afford to lose all the money he had already spent.  The embassy officials took Singh's \npassport to be stamped and sent it back to Dewan.  Singh also took and passed a skills test \nattended by Signal employee John Sanders. \n231.  In or around late January, 2007, Dewan informed Singh that he would leave \nwithin days for the United States and receive his green card.  Singh was instructed to travel to \nMumbai.  On the day of departure, Singh paid Dewan the remainder of the fees in cash for the \nfinal installment.  Dewan made Singh sign papers written in English without telling Singh what \n56 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 57 of 78\nthe papers were or providing copies. Dewan also required that Singh turn over all his \ndocumentation recording his transactions with the Defendants before giving Singh his passport \nand plane ticket. \n232.  Singh entered the United States on or around January 24, 2007 on an H-2B visa. \nOnly when he arrived at Signal's labor camp in Mississippi did Singh learn that the visa that \nDewan had secured for him was a temporary work visa rather than a permanent green card. \nHowever, Signal employees ensured Singh that Signal would obtain a green card for him ifhe \ncontinued to work for them. \n233.  At Signal's Mississippi camp, Singh was forced to live in the same miserable \nconditions as the other Indian workers.  The Signal employees were abusive toward the Indian \nworkers on account of their race and alienage. In one instance, while Singh was sitting on an \noverturned bucket using a grinder, a foreman told him he was not permitted to sit and kicked the \nbucket out from underneath Mr. Singh, causing him to fall on the ground.  Signal employees \nregularly called the workers \"f\"*king Indians\" and assigned them more difficult and dangerous \nwork than that assigned to American workers.  Although  Singh was paid $18 per hour, he \nlearned that American workers were paid significantly more. \n234.  Singh stayed with Signal because of its promises of obtaining a green card for him \nand because of the debt that he and his family had incurred to come to the United States.  Mr. \nSingh continued to work, even when he was injured, in order to payoff his debt.  He also \nremained there because Signal employees threatened to have him deported ifhe did not continue \nto work. However, Singh finally escaped Signal in 2008 and went to live with a friend. \nHowever, because he did not have authorization to work, Mr. Singh was unemployed from \napproximately 2009 until 2011. \n57 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 58 of 78\nJohn Malakaran Thomas \n235.  In or around 2003, Thomas was working in Qatar as a mechanics supervisor when \nhe saw an advertisement for a job opportunity for skilled workers that included permanent \nresidency visas in the United States.  After seeing this advertisement, Thomas attended an \nintroductory seminar in Cochin.  Sachin Dewan, Kurella Rao and others explained that for \napproximately $14,000 (plus $1,500 for each family member), participants could obtain green \ncards for themselves and their families.  Defendants explained that participants would be \nworking on the U.S. Gulf Coast for Indo-Amerisoft. \n236.  Deciding to participate in this program, Thomas traveled to Dewan's Mumbai \noffice in or around January 2004 to make the first installment payment. \n237.  In or around December 2005, Thomas was informed that his labor certificate had \nbeen approved.  In or around February 2006, Thomas made his second installment payment. \n238.  In or around October 2006, Thomas was informed that Dewan, Pol, and Burnett \nwere providing workers with H-2B visas to work for Signal.  Deciding to participate in the \nSignal opportunity, Thomas later took part in a test/interview with Signal representatives in \nChennai. They explained that Signal would provide participants with H-2B visas (including \nextensions) while their green cards were being processed. \n239.  On or around November 4, 2006, Thomas travelled to Chennai for his U.S. \nconsulate interview.  Thomas was required to pay additional fees related to this interview. \nBefore the consulate interview, Thomas attended a meeting with Defendants, who told Thomas \nnot to tell the consulate that they had paid recruitment fees. Following the consulate interview, \nthe consulate took Thomas' passport, which was later sent to Dewan. \n58 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 59 of 78\n240.  In or around December 2006, Thomas, at his own expense, travelled to Dewan's \noffice in Mwnbai and made his third installment payment.  Thomas obtained the money to pay \nDefendants from his savings, selling his wife's jewelry, and by taking out loans with money \nlenders, using his land and house as collateral.  Dewan requested that Thomas return all·of his \noriginal docwnents related to the recruitment process with the Defendants.  If Thomas did not \nreturn the docwnents, Dewan stated that he would not return Thomas' passport, Thomas would \nforfeit all of the money he had paid, and he would not be able to go to the United States.  Faced \nwith this threat, Thomas returned the docwnents.  Thomas was also rushed into signing \ndocwnents in English without first being able to read them.  Dewan returned Thomas' passport \nonly after Thomas complied with these demands.  In or around December 2006, Thomas arrived \nin the United States. \n241.  Thomas was forced to live in the same overcrowded conditions as the other Indian \nworkers at the Pascagoula, Mississippi camp.  Despite these circumstances, Thomas felt \ncompelled to stay at Signal because he was deeply in debt with money lenders and could not risk \nbeing unemployed.  In fact, in or around May 2007, Thomas took leave from Signal for a month \nin order to return to India and deal with money lenders who were threatening to take his family's \nproperty.  Additionally, Thomas did not leave Signal because Defendants continued to promise \nthat Thomas' green card was being processed.  They also promised to process Thomas' visa \nextension, collecting additional payments from him in or around 2008. \n242.  Thomas finally left Signal in or around January 2009.  After leaving, Thomas was \ninitially unable to find steady work and was unemployed for months at a time. \nSaju Christy Vallarian \n59 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 60 of 78\n243.  In or about December 2003, Vallarian was on vacation in his hometown of \nKerala, India from pipe-fitting work in Dubai.  While on vacation, he saw an advertisement in a \nlocal newspaper about a job opportunity in the United States through Dewan Consultants that \npromised workers and their families the opportunity to obtain U.S. green cards.  Dewan claimed \nthat the job was with lndo-Amerisoft in Louisiana and that the green card process would take 18 \nmonths. \n244.  Vallarian decided to look into the opportunity and attended a seminar in KeraIa. \nAt the seminar, Defendants explained the details of the opportunity, including that participants \ncould bring their families to the United States with them and that if the green card process was \nnot completed in 18 months, their money would be refunded.  Dewan said that the cost of \nparticipation in the program was six lakh rupees to be paid in installments. \n245.  Shortly after attending the seminar, at Dewan's urging, Vallarian paid to take a \npipe-fitting test, which he passed.  On or around December 26,2003, he again paid to undergo a \nmedical exam.  Vallarian then returned to Dubai to continue his pipe-fitting work. \n246.  To make the payments from Defendants, Vallarian took out loans from family \nmembers and neighbors.  Although the process was beset by delays, Vallarian was constantly \nreassured that the process was running smoothly. \n247.  Prior to getting married in May 2006, Vallarian was told by Dewan that it would \nnot be a problem for his wife and family to obtain visas to join him in the United States. \n248.  In or around June 2005, Vallarian learned that his labor certification had been \napproved.  Nevertheless, nothing happened until October 2006, when Vallarian was contacted by \nDewan and informed that due to a change in the green card processing, he could travel to the \nUnited States immediately to work for a different company, Signal, under an H-2B visa.  Dewan \n60 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 61 of 78\nexplained that processing ofVallarian's green card would continue while he lived and worked in \nthe United States under the H-2B visa.  Vallarian was disappointed not to receive a green card \nbut he felt he had no choice but to proceed because he had already borrowed and paid a lot of \nmoney towards the process.  He resigned from his job in Dubai and returned to India on or \naround October 22, 2006. \n249.  In or around November 2006, Vallarian attended another skills test in Chennai \nadministered by Signal, which he passed.  He learned that Signal would be providing food and \naccommodations at his new job.  He also met with Dewan and Burnett to prepare for his \nconsulate interview.  Vallarian was instructed not to say that he had paid money towards the \nvisa/green card process.  Following the consulate interview, Vallarian's passport was sent to \nDewan. \n250.  On or around December 6, 2006, Vallarian travelled to Mumbai before leaving for \nthe United States.  Dewan forced him to sign documents written in English that he did not \nunderstand.  Vallarian was told that he had to sign in order to travel to the United States.  Since \nhe had already quit his job in Dubai and paid substantial amounts of money for this opportunity, \nVallarian felt he had no choice but to sign. At this time, he also paid the third installment \npayment.  Only then was he given his passport and permitted to fly to the United States. \n251.  Vallarian arrived in the United States on or about December 2006.  Vallarian was \nforced to live in the same overcrowded, unsanitary conditions as the other Indian workers at \nSignal's labor camp in Pascagoula, Mississippi.  The food occasionally made him ill, and when \nhe was forced to miss work because of illness, he was suspended from work for three days \nwithout pay.  This was especially troubling because Signal was deducting $35 per day from \n61 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 62 of 78\nVallarian's pay for food and accommodations.  Vallarian was also afraid to speak out about the \nhorrible conditions because others who had spoken out were threatened with deportation. \nIsaac Wi/son Vazhikudilil \n252.  Vazhikudilil first heard of Defendants' recruitment scheme in Kerala, India while \nattending a seminar for pipefitter jobs in Nigeria.  He had also seen such opportunities in the \nUnited States advertised in local newspapers. \n253.  In or about December 2003, Vazhikudilil attended two seminars led by Sachin \nDewan, Kurella Rao, Malvern Burnett, and their associates.  Vazhikudilil understood the \nopportunity to entail a chance to work at a shipyard in the United States, as well as obtaining \ngreen cards for the workers and their families within nine months through fast-track processing. \nDewan told the attendees that they would have to pay five lakh rupees in three installments to \nparticipate in the program. \n254.  Defendants advised the attendees that they would be working as pipe fitters in a \nshipyard in either Mississippi, Louisiana, or California for Indo-Amerisoft.  They also explained \nthat, in addition to their salaries, the employer would provide free food, housing, and \ntransportation.  Vazhikudilil provided the Defendants with his experience certificate and signed \nvarious documents written in English.  He also paid the first installment, which he had funded in \npart by borrowing money from a friend. \n255.  Vazhikudilil worked in Nigeria for the next year and a half.  Upon returning to \nKerala in on around March 2005,  Dewan provided Vazhikudilil with a letter saying that \nVazhikudilil needed to submit a labor certification application.  Dewan said that, because of this, \nthe green card process would take another two months. \n62 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 63 of 78\n256.  In or around January 2006, the Defendants informed Vazhikudilil that his labor \ncertification had been approved.  However, when Vazhikudilil went to Dewan's office to pick up \nthe labor certification and pay the second installment, he was informed that the processing of his \nlabor certification was further delayed because of Hurricane Katrina.  Vazhikudilil nevertheless \nwas required to pay the second installment. \n257.  In or around October 2006, Vazhikudilil was told that, while the green card \nprocess would take another six months, the company had received temporary work visas that \ncould be used to work in the United States in the interim.  Once the green card process was \ncomplete, he could bring his family with him to the United States. \n258.  In or around November 2006, Vazhikudilil attended a seminar led by Dewan, Pol \nand Burnett.  Dewan explained that while a green card would take another five or six months, the \nworkers could travel to the United States in the next week on an H-2B visa, which was a ten \nmonth visa that could be extended twice.  The participants were also told that there would be no \nrefunds for anyone who decided to back out of the process. \n259.  To qualify for the visa, Vazhikudilil took a skills test in fitting and welding in \nChennai.  Vazhikudilil passed the test and was told that he would receive an appointment for a \nconsulate interview.  Before the consulate interview, he met with Dewan, who instructed him not \nto tell the consulate that he had paid money to a third party to process the visa.  Dewan also \ninstructed that, if asked, Vazhikudilil was to tell the consulate officer that he planned to stay in \nthe United States only until his visa expired on July 31, 2007. \n260.  Vazhikudilil attended his consulate interview and answered questions as \ninstructed by Dewan.  Following the interview, the consulate officer took possession of \nV azhikudilil' s passport.  Dewan said they would pick up his passport and return it to \n63 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 64 of 78\nVazhikudilil before he went to the United States.  Dewan also informed him that he had to pay \nanother one lakh rupee (approximately $2,000) for the flight from Mumbai to the United States. \nVazhikudilil was forced to borrow money from friends and to pawn his family jewelry. \n261.  Soon thereafter, Dewan informed Vazhikudilil that his H-2B visa had been \napproved and that he would depart for the United States some time around the end of November \n2006. The day before departing for Mumbai, Vazhikudilil went to Dewan's office and paid a \nportion of the third installment. \n262.  On or around November 26, 2006, Vazhikudilil flew to Mumbai and proceeded to \nDewan's office.  There, in a rushed meeting led by Dewan, he was informed that he would be \ngoing to the United States on an H-2B visa sponsored by Signal.  Dewan told him that Signal \nwould process their H-2B visa extensions, if necessary, while concurrently processing their green \ncard applications.  Dewan also told the group that Signal would provide all accommodations and \nfood at no charge once they arrived in the United States. Vazhikudilil was told that if they chose \nto back out, their first two installment payments would not be refunded. Vazhikudilil felt \nuncertain about the changed circumstances, but since he owed a great deal of money and had \nalready turned down ajob in Nigeria to pursue this \"opportunity,\" he felt he had no choice but to \npay the remainder of the third installment and the travel expenses.  Vazhikudilil paid Dewan and \nwas told to sign contracts and paperwork written in English that Vazhikudilil could not \nunderstand.  Dewan then provided Vazhikudilil with his passport, H-2B visa, and plane ticket. \n263.  Vazhikudilil arrived in the United States on or around November 28, 2006 and \nwas forced to live in the same overcrowded, unsanitary conditions as the other Indian workers in \nSignal's labor camp in Pascagoula, Mississippi. Despite the poor and unsanitary conditions, \ninsufficient access to health care and mistreatment at the hands of Signal employees, \n64 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 65 of 78\nVazhikudilil remained at the labor camp out of fear that, if he left, he would be deported back to \nIndia.  Because he was deeply in debt and because his family depended on him, Vazhikudilil felt \nhe had no choice but to remain at Signal. \nBenny Yohannan \n264.  In or about late 2003 or early 2004, Yohannan was working in Abu Dhabi as a \nwelder when he saw an advertisement from Dewan Consultants for an opportunity to work in the \nUnited States and obtain a green card. \n265.  Soon thereafter, Yohannan went to Dewan's offices in Abu Dhabi for an \nintroductory meeting.  Yo hannan was told that the recruitment scheme would occur in three \nstages, with three installment payments.  After the first installment, Yo hannon' s labor \ncertification would be processed within six months.  He also was infonned that Rao would \nsponsor his green card process.  At Dewan's request, Yohannan paid an advance on the first \ninstallment at this meeting. \n266.  Not until the end of 2005 did Defendants infonn Yohannan that his certification \nhad been approved.  In or about January 2006; Yohannan received a faxed copy of his \ncertification. \n267.  In or around November 2006, Dewan infonned Yohannan that the green card \napplications were further delayed.  Dewan advised Yohannan that he should apply for a H-2B \nvisa and go to the United States to work for Signal while he waited for his green card.  Yohannan \nwas later told that he would have to pay an additional fee to participate in the H-2B program. \nYohannan agreed to participate in the H-2B program, took leave from his job in Abu Dhabi, and \nflew to Chennai at his own expense. \n65 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 66 of 78\n268.  In Chennai, Yohannan passed a welding test for Signal.  Defendants stated that \nSignal, not Indo-Amerisoft, would be processing their visa extensions and green cards.  Also, \nDewan described the consulate interviews and wamed Yo hannan not to discuss the green card \nprocess.  Dewan also stated that the participants would not be getting their passports back until \nafter they paid the last installment. \n269.  In or around December 2006, Yohannan attended his consulate interview.  Soon \nthereafter, Dewan informed Yohannan that his visa had been approved and that he needed to \ncome to Mumbai quickly.  Accordingly, Yohannan was forced to resign from his job in Abu \nDhabi without first canceling his visa, foregoing the benefits to which he was entitled. \n270.  Yohannan went to Dewan's Mumbai office to pay the third installment and the \nadditional H-2B fee. Yohannan obtained the money necessary for all three installments from his \nsavings, loans from private lenders, and selling his family's home and land.  Dewan pressured \nYo hannan into signing documents that he did not fully understand.  Yo hannan left Mumbai for \nthe United States on or around December 18, 2006. \n271.  At Signal's Pascagoula, Mississippi camp, Yohannan was forced to live in the \nsame horrible conditions as the rest of the Indian workers.  Like the other Indian workers, he was \nalso forced to work in unsafe and dirty conditions.  For example, Signal foremen would \nsometimes demand that Indian welders work in areas that lacked proper ventilation or work \noutside in the rain, exposing the workers to the risk of electrocution.  Further, the foreman \ntreated Yo hannan and the other Indian workers harshly and some times threatened them with \nsuspension. \n66 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 67 of 78\n272.  Despite all ofthis, Yohannan felt compelled to stay at Signal because he had \nalready paid so much money and still had debt to payoff.  Further, Burnett and Signal continued \nto promise that their visa extensions and green cards were being processed. \n273.  In or around October 2007, fed up with the horrible living and work conditions, \nYohannan finally left Signal. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nTHE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION \nREAUTHORIZATION ACT (\"TVPRA\") OF 2003 \nForced Labor (18 U.S. C. § 1589) and Trafficking with Respect to Peonage, Slavery, \nInvoluntary Servitude, or Forced Labor (18 U.S.C. § 1590) \n274.  Each Plaintiffre-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n275.  Each Plaintiff brings this claim against all Defendants. \n276.  Each Plaintiff is authorized to bring these civil claims against all Defendants \npursuant to the civil remedies provisions of 18 U .S.C. § 1595. \n277.  Defendants Signal, Dewan, Burnett, and Pol attempted to and did subject each \nPlaintiff to forced labor in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1589. \n278.  Defendant Signal employed Plaintiffs in dangerous conditions at a guarded and \ngated man camp, and all Defendants falsely assured Plaintiffs that if they continued to work, \nSignal would assist them in applying for and receiving green cards.  Defendants controlled \nPlaintiffs' housing, food, access to medical care, and other basic needs, and if Plaintiffs did not \ncontinue working for Signal, they would have been cut off from those needs. \n279.  Furthermore, the substantial \"recruitment fees\" that Defendants coerced Plaintiffs \ninto paying forced Plaintiffs to work at Signal to pay off their substantial debts. \n67 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 68 of 78\n280.  Defendants knowingly attempted to and did physically restrain and/or threaten \neach Plaintiff with serious harm in order to obtain the labor and services of each Plaintiff in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §1589(1). \n281.  Defendants knowingly attempted to and did obtain the labor and services of each \nPlaintiff using a scheme, plan, or pattern which, in the totality of the circumstances, was intended \nto coerce and did coerce each Plaintiff to believe that he would suffer serious harm if he were to \nleave the employ of Defendant Signal in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1589(2). \n282.  Defendants' scheme to isolate Plaintiffs, coerce them to live in conditions causing \npsychological harm, and limit their outside contacts, which included unlawful discrimination in \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981, was designed to convince Plaintiffs that they would suffer serious \nharm if they were to leave the employ of Signal. \n283.  Defendants threatened not to extend Plaintiffs' H-2B visas, not to sponsor \nPlaintiffs for green cards, to deport Plaintiffs, and to send them back to India if they complained \nabout conditions at Signal, and also deceived Plaintiffs about the terms of their immigration \nstatus, each in a manner that constitutes an abuse ofthe legal process under 18 U.S.C. § 1589(3). \nDefendants retaliated against Plaintiffs when they sought legal advice regarding their rights and \nimmigration status. \n284.  Defendants knowingly recruited, transported, harbored, provided, and/or obtained \nthe Plaintiffs so as to procure their labor and services in violation of laws prohibiting peonage, \ninvoluntary servitude, and forced labor within the meaning of the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § \n1590. \n285.  In violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1590, and in addition to the violations of 18 U.S.C. § \n1589 set forth above, Defendants knowingly recruited, transported, harbored and/or obtained the \n68 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 69 of 78\nPlaintiffs for labor or services in furtherance of Defendants' violations of the following \nprovisions of Title 18, Chapter 77 of the U.S. Code: \na.  enticing, persuading, or inducing the Plaintiffs to board an airplane and to travel \nto various locations throughout India and the United States, with the intent that \nthey may be made or held in modern-day slavery, violating 18 U.S.C. § 1583; \nb.  knowingly and willfully holding Plaintiffs to involuntary servitude, as defined by \nthe TVPRA, 22 U.S.C. §7102(5)(a) and (b), thereby violating 18 U.S.C. § 1584; \nc.  removing, confiscating, or possessing Plaintiffs' and other class members' \npassports and other immigration documents in the course of violating, or with the \nintent to violate 18 U.S.C. §§ 1583, 1584, 1589, and 1590, thereby violating 18 \nU.S.C. § I 592(a); and attempting to violate 18 U.S. C. §§ 1583, 1584, 1589, and \n1590, thereby violating 18 U.S.C. § I 594(a). \n286.  Defendants' actions evince malice and/or reckless indifference towards Plaintiffs. \n287.  As a proximate result of the conduct of Defendants, Plaintiffs have suffered \ninjuries to their persons, businesses, and property, as well as other damages. Plaintiffs are \nentitled to recover compensatory and punitive damages in an amount to be proven at trial, \nincluding recruitment fees, other payments made to Defendants, additional costs expended by \nPlaintiffs in pursuit of this recruitment scheme, and attorneys' fees. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nVIOLATIONS OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1866 \n42 U.S.C. § 1981 \n288.  Each Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n69 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 70 of 78\n289.  Each Plaintiff asserts this claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1981 for declaratory \nrelief and damages against Defendant Signal. \n290.  Each Plaintiff is a member of a racial minority, as contemplated by 42 U.S.C. § \n1981. \n291.  The actions of Defendant Signal, as set forth herein, violated Plaintiffs' rights to \nreceive full and equal benefit of all laws as guaranteed by 42 U.S.C. § 1981, including Plaintiffs' \nrights to enjoy and benefit from non-discriminatory employment relationships with Defendant \nSignal. \n292.  Specifically, Defendant Signal subjected Plaintiffs to discriminatory and offensive \nmandatory room and board arrangements at Signal man camps in Pascagoula.  Defendant Signal \ndid not subject its employees of non-Indian race, ethnicity, or alienage to the same or similar \nroom and board arrangements.  These discriminatory and offensive living arrangements included \ndeplorable and unlawful overcrowding, lack of privacy, provision of inedible food, segregation \ninto a prison-like camp, personal searches, improper scrutiny, restrictions of ordinary freedoms \nsuch as visitors, and the imposition of unreasonable fees.  Because these living conditions were \nrequired by Signal as part of their employment, they constitute a part of the discriminatory work \nenvironment that Plaintiffs experienced. \n293.  As set forth in the preceding paragraphs, Defendant Signal also imposed \ndiscriminatory job-related requirements and adverse terms and conditions of employment to \nwhich its employees of non-Indian race, ethnicity, or alienage were not similarly subject. \n294.  As set forth in the preceding paragraphs, Defendant Signal also created and \nfostered a discriminatory work environment in which Indian workers were subjected to anti \nIndian invectives throughout the time Plaintiffs were employed, and in which Signal forced Sikh \n70 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 71 of 78\nworkers to shave religiously mandated beards. Signal employees of non-Indian race, ethnicity, or \nalienage or not of the Sikh religion were not subjected to a similar work environment. \n295.  As set forth in the preceding paragraphs, through the actions and statements ofits \npersonnel referring to and/or directed at Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers, Defendant \nSignal maintained an objectively hostile and abusive work environment on account of Plaintiffs' \nrace, ethnicity, religion, and alienage throughout the time Plaintiffs were employed. \n296.  As set forth in the preceding paragraphs, Defendant Signal's discriminatory and \noffensive treatment of Plaintiffs was sufficiently severe that it created a hostile work \nenvironment in violation of 42 U .S.C. § 1981 throughout the time Plaintiffs were employed. \n297.  Plaintiffs reasonably perceived their work environment to be hostile, abusive, and \ndiscriminatory on the basis of their race, ethnicity, religion, and alienage. \n298.  Defendant Signal's hostile, abusive, and discriminatory treatment of Plaintiffs \nwas unwelcome. \n299.  Defendant Signal knowingly, willfully, maliciously, intentionally, and without \njustification acted to deprive Plaintiffs of their rights. \n300.  Defendants' actions evince malice and/or reckless indifference towards Plaintiffs. \n30 I.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' knowing, willing, and intentional \nactions, each Plaintiffs has been injured, and is entitled to recover compensatory and punitive \ndamages in an amount to be proven at trial, including attorneys' fees. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION \n302.  Each Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n71 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 72 of 78\n303.  Each Plaintiff brings this claim against all Defendants. \n304.  The actions of Defendants, as set forth herein, constitute fraudulent \nmisrepresentation under Mississippi law. \n305.  Specifically, Defendants, individually and through their agents, employees, and/or \nrepresentatives, knowingly made materially false and untrue statements and representations to \nPlaintiffs regarding the nature, terms, and conditions of applications and opportunities for \nimmigration status and employment in the United States. \n306.  Defendants and/or their respective agents represented to each Plaintiff that ( 1) \nPlaintiffs would be eligible for permanent residency given their employment with Signal; (2) \nDefendants would apply for permanent residency in the United States on behalf of Plaintiffs no \nlater than 24 months after the commencement of work; (3) their families would also receive \npermanent residency; (4) Plaintiffs would have steady and ongoing work opportunities provided \nby Defendants in the United States; (5) the entire recruitment process would cost Plaintiffs \nbetween five and six lakh rupees; and (6) that they would receive free room and board from their \nemployer. \n307.  At the time each of these representations were made, Defendants knew they were \nfalse or misleading. \n308.  Defendants intended that the false statements made by each Defendant and/or the \nDefendants' respective agents, employees, and/or representatives would induce Plaintiffs to pay \nthe exorbitant \"recruitment fees,\" would induce Plaintiffs to leave their homes and jobs abroad, \ntravel to the United States, and work for Signal, and would induce Plaintiffs to pay the room and \nboard fee and other fees extracted by Signal upon their arrival in the United States. \n309.

In reasonable reliance on the false representations of Defendants and their \nrespective agents, employees, and/or representatives regarding green cards, employment \nopportunities, and employment conditions, Plaintiffs surrendered employment opportunities in \nIndia and abroad, left their homes arid families behind, sold personal and real property, secured \nloans at usurious interest rates, traveled to the United States, lived in deplorable conditions, and \nworked for Signal under discriminatory and inhumane conditions.  Further, once in the United \nStates, Plaintiffs continued to work for Signal after receiving repeated assurances that \nDefendants' prior representations were in fact true. \n312.  No later than the first day that Indian workers arrived at Signal, Defendants knew \nthat Plaintiffs and their coworkers believed that Defendants had applied, or were intending to \napply, for permanent residency on behalf of Plaintiffs. Defendants therefore had an obligation to \ntell Plaintiffs that this was not true. Defendants failed to do so. \n313.  Defendants' actions evince malice and/or reckless indifference towards Plaintiffs. \n314.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' knowing, willing, and intentional \nactions, each Plaintiff has been injured, and is entitled to recover compensatory damages, \nincluding opportunity costs, and punitive damages in an amount to be proven at trial. \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nNEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATION \n73 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-06221-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 08/14/13   Page 74 of 78\n315.

These promises were made in exchange for each Plaintiffs payment of fees \n(including recruitment, immigration application, and travel fees) to Defendants and their \nemployees, agents, and/or representatives, and in exchange for each Plaintiffs agreement to work \nfor Signal. \n333.  Each Plaintiff accepted Defendants' offers and promises; each Plaintiff paid the \nagreed upon fees, and performed the agreed-upon work. \n334.
