Plaintiffs filed this suit after <a href=\"http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-LA-0010-0016.pdf\">District Judge Jay Zainey denied class certification</a> on Jan. 3, 2012 in a related case, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14377\"><i>David v. Signal International</i></a>.</p><p>Plaintiffs claimed that they were brought into the United States to provide labor and services to defendant, Signal International, a company providing repairs to offshore oil rigs based in Pascagoula, Mississippi, with operations in the Gulf Coast region. The complaint alleged that plaintiffs paid Signal's recruiters as much as $16,000 for travel, visa, and recruitment fees, but upon arrival in the United States discovered that they would not receive the green cards promised to them. Instead, plaintiffs were forced to pay additional fees ($1,050 per month) to live in racially-segregated labor camps and were subject to squalid living conditions and threats of both legal and physical harm if they complained about the conditions or decided not to provide labor. </p><p>Represented by private counsel, plaintiffs alleged violations of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (18 U.S.C. § 1589 et seq.) and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. § 1981), as well as claims for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract. </p><p>In Mar. 2014, the Court (Chief U.S. District Judge Louis Guirola, Jr.) transferred this case to the Eastern District of Louisiana. On Apr. 24, 2014, Judge Susie Morgan ordered that this case be consolidated with the <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14380\"><i>Achari</i></a> case.</p><p>This case continues at the case page for <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14380\"><i>Achari</i></a>.</p>",

CIVIL ACTION\nPlaintiffs\nVERSUS No. 08-1220\nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL, LLC, et al., SECTION “E”\nDefendants\nRelated Cases:\nEQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY CIVIL ACTION\nCOMMISSION,\nPlaintiff\nVERSUS No. 12-557\nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL, LLC, et al., SECTION “E”\nDefendants\nLAKSHMANAN PONNAYAN ACHARI, et al., CIVIL ACTION\nPlaintiffs\nVERSUS No. 13-6218\n (c/w 13-6219, 13-6220,\n13-6221, 14-732)\nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL, LLC, et al., SECTION \"E\"\nDefendants\nApplies To: Achari v. Signal (13-6218 c/w 13-6219, 13-6220, 13-6221, 14-732)\nORDER  AND REASONS\nBefore the Court is a Motion for Protective Order filed by Plaintiffs in Achari v.\nSignal (13-6218, 13-6219, 13-6220, 13-6221)(the \"Achari cases\").1 Defendants Signal\n1R. Doc. 144. All documents referenced in this order were filed in 13-6218 unless otherwise\nindicated. \n1\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 307   Filed 08/18/14   Page 2 of 5\nInternational, LLC (\"Signal\") and Burnett oppose Plaintiffs' motion.2\nPlaintiffs in the Achari cases move for entry of a protective order to prohibit\ndiscovery of documents and information relating to the Plaintiffs' (and their families')\ncurrent  immigration  status,  immigration  history,  addresses  or  residences  following\nemployment at Signal, places of birth, social security numbers, aliases or nicknames, post-\nSignal employers or potential employers, and sources of income (other than income\nreceived from the defendants).3 Plaintiffs argue the requested protective order mimics the\nprotections already afforded in David v. Signal (08-1220)(the \"David case\") and EEOC v.\nSignal (12-557)(the \"EEOC case\"). Plaintiffs further argue the protections are necessary\nbecause the relevance of the information Signal will otherwise seek is severely outweighed\nby the intimidating in terrorem effect discovery of such information has on the Plaintiffs'\nwillingness to prosecute their claims. \nDuring the class certification phase, the Plaintiffs in the David case sought and\nobtained  a  protective  order  preventing  defendants  from  inquiring  into  the  current\nimmigration status of any Plaintiff, current address or place of residence of any plaintiff,\nand employers or potential employers of any plaintiff post-termination of employment with\nSignal.4 Because it would require an inquiry into the Plaintiffs current immigration status,\non August 26, 2010 Judge Knowles denied Signal's request for production of the Plaintiffs' \n2R. Doc. 147; R. Doc. 158. \n3R. Doc. 144. The Court, with the consent of the parties, entered a protective order covering other\ntopics on February 17, 2014. See R. Doc. 183. \n4Judge Knowles granted the plaintiffs' request for a protective order (R.Doc. 367 in the\nDavid case), and on June 2, 2009 Judge Zainey upheld Judge Knowles' findings. R. Doc. 476 in the\nDavid case. Judge Zainey denied a request for reconsideration of his order based on changed\ncircumstances and clarified that the protective ordered entered by the Court does not preclude Defendants\nfrom \"delving into facts pertaining to plaintiffs' immigration status prior to leaving Signal – only post-\nSignal immigration status is affected.\" R. Doc. 650 in the David case.\n2\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 307   Filed 08/18/14   Page 3 of 5\nT-Visa applications but, based on a compromise proposed by the parties, ordered that the\naffidavits attached to the applications should be produced.5 The Court entered a protective\norder with respect to production of the affidavits clarifying that they were to be marked as\nconfidential and redacted to remove the following information:\na. any information identifying members of the affiant's family, the affiant's\nresidences prior to employment at Signal, or the residences of any member\nof the affiant's family. \nb. Any address or employment information protected from disclosure by the\nCourt's earlier protective order [preventing inquiry into the Plaintiffs' current\nimmigration  status,  current  addresses,  and  employment  history  post-\ntermination from Signal].\nc.  Any  information  evidencing  the  affiant's  cooperation  with  any  law\nenforcement investigation or prosecution related to the subject matter of the\ninstant lawsuit.\nd. Any information evidencing grounds for inadmissibility.\ne. Any information evidencing the commission of prior crimes or civil\noffenses, or any explanation of any act set forth on Form I-914, Part D.6 \nMotions for a protective order also were granted in the EEOC case over Signal's\nobjection that protective orders had been issued in the David case only because the parties\nwere concentrating on class discovery issues at the time.7  The Court found the fact that the\nparties were not engaging in discovery relating to certification of the class to be of no\nmoment, saying:\nThe  case  law  cited  by  this  Court  does  not  distinguish  between  class-\ncertification  and  merits-based  discovery  to  arrive  at  their  conclusions. \nIndeed, in many of the cases, it is not readily apparent that the plaintiffs\nsought class certification.  The Court finds that the underlying reasoning and\nanalysis of those courts apply equally here at this stage of the litigation. 8\n5R. Doc. 854 in the David case. On November 5, 2010 Judge Knowles ordered the redacted\naffidavits to be produced within ten days of the date of his Order. R. Doc. 912 in the David case.\n6R. Doc. 913 in the David case. Judge Zainey upheld this ruling. See R. Doc. 991. \n7R. Doc. 237 in the EEOC case. Affirmed in R. Doc. 313 in the EEOC case.\n8R. Doc. 237, p. 12 in the EEOC case. \n3\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 307   Filed 08/18/14   Page 4 of 5\nThereafter,  a  Protective  Order  was  entered  in  the  EEOC  case  providing  that\nDefendants shall not seek, request or subpoena the following documents or information:\na. Documents and information relating to, or that would disclose, the\ncurrent  immigration  status,  immigration  history,  or  any  immigration\nproceeding of any member of the class of Indian employees described in\nPlaintiff's  Complaint,  as  amended,  or  the  Intervenor  Plaintiffs,  or  any\nmembers of the families of either of these groups;\nb. Documents and information relating to the addresses or places of\nresidence following employment at Signal, place of birth, social security\nnumber, and aliases and nicknames (other than those used while employed\nby Defendant) of any class member described in Plaintiff's Complaint, as\namended, or the Intervenor Plaintiffs, or any members of the families of\neither of these groups;\nc. Documents and information relating to, or that would disclose, post-\nSignal employers or potential employers of any class member described in\nPlaintiff's  Complaint,  as  amended,  or  the  Intervenor  Plaintiffs,  or  any\nmembers of the families of either of these groups;\nd. Documents and information relating to income received or sources\nof income, other than income received by Defendant, of any class member\ndescribed in Plaintiff's Complaint, as amended, or the Intervenor Plaintiffs,\nor any members of the families of either of these groups.9 \nThe  Court has repeatedly explained its reasons for finding that the in terrorem effect\nof inquiring into the Plaintiffs' immigration status after they left the employment of Signal,\nand other information at issue, is outweighed by the public interest in allowing employees\nto enforce their rights, and will not do so again in this Order. The underlying reasoning and\nanalysis of previous orders apply with equal force to the merits stage of this proceeding.\nPlaintiffs' post-Signal immigration status is not relevant to a material aspect of any defense. \nAny prejudice suffered by the Defendants is obviated by the production of the redacted\naffidavits attached to the T and U Visa applications.\nAccordingly, IT IS ORDERED that Plaintiffs' Motion for Protective Order be and\n9R. Doc. 285 in the EEOC case. \n4\n\nCase 2:13-cv-06218-SM-DEK   Document 307   Filed 08/18/14   Page 5 of 5\nhereby is GRANTED. The current protective order in the Achari cases10 be and hereby is\nsupplemented to include the following in Paragraph 1 of Section A:\n1.  The  Defendants  shall  not  seek,  request,  or  subpoena  the  following;\ndocuments or information:\na. Documents and information relating to, or that would disclose, the current\nimmigration status, immigration history, or any immigration proceeding of\nany Plaintiff in the Consolidated Actions or any members of the families of\nsuch Plaintiffs;\nb. Documents and information relating to addresses or places of residence\nfollowing employment at Signal International, LLC (\"Signal\"), place of birth,\nsocial security number, and aliases and nicknames (other than those used\nwhile employed by Signal) of any Plaintiff in the Consolidated Actions or any\nmembers of the families of such Plaintiffs;\nc. Documents and information relating to, or that would disclose, post-Signal\nemployers or potential employers of any Plaintiff in the Consolidated Actions\nor any members of the families of such Plaintiffs;\nd. Documents and information relating to income received or sources of\nincome, other than income received from the Defendants, of any Plaintiff in\nthe Consolidated Actions or any members of the families of such Plaintiffs.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Plaintiffs in the Achari cases are to produce\nthe affidavits attached to their T or U visa applications to Defendants within 30 days of the\ndate of this order, redacted as set forth above with production to be subject to the terms of\nthe Protective Order. \nNew Orleans, Louisiana, this 18th day of August, 2014.\n____________________________\n         SUSIE MORGAN\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n10R.

Before  the  Court  is  Signal’s  Motion  for  Partial  Summary  Judgment  on \nPlaintiffs’  First  Claim  for  Relief  under  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection \nReauthorization  Act  (TVPA’).1  Signal  appears  fo  seek  summary  judgment \non  three  grounds:  (1)  the  TVPA  claims  are  extraterritorial;  (2)  financial \nharm  is  a  not  a  component  of  “serious  harm’  under  the  pre-amendment \nversion  of  the  TVPA;  and  (3)  there  is  no  evidence  of  the  requisite  scienter \nfo  support  a  TVPA  claim. \n|.  Extraterritoriality \nOn  December  23,  2008,  Congress  amenced  the  TVPA  to  provide  federal \ncourts  with  extraterritorial  jurisdiction  over  certain  claims.3  Signal  argues \nthe  2008  amendment  is  not  retroactive.  Accordingly,  Plaintiffs’  claims  are \ngoverned  by  the  pre-amendment  version  of  the  TVPA,  which  Signal  argues \nis  restricted  to  “purely  domestic’  trafficking  claims.  Signal  contends \nPlaintiffs’  claims  are  extraterritorial,  because  they  rely  extensively  on  events \nthat  occurred  outside  the  United  States.  Accordingly,  Signal  argues  the \nclaims  are  not  cognizable  as  a  matter  of  law. \nThe  Court  need  not  decide  whether  the  amendment  to  the  TVPA  was \nretroactive,  because  Plaintiffs’  claims  are  not  extraterritorial.  As  one  court\nhas  observed:  “the  TVPA  is  not  applied  extraterritorially  when  it  addresses \ntrafficking  people  info  the  United  States  to  perform  forced  labor  here,  even \nif  done  by  means  of  threats  of  serious  harm  in  part  made  elsewhere.’ \nMoreover,  courts  regularly  entertain  suits  under  the  pre-amendment  TPVA \nalleging  trafficking  into  the  United  States  from  a  foreign  country.s \nAlthough  certain  elements  of  the  alleged  trafficking  scheme  occurred \nabroad,  “the  focus  and  the  touchstone  of  the  territoriality  inquiry  of  the \nTVPA  is  where  the  forced  labor  occurred  and  to  where  the  victims  were \ntrafficked,  and  not  from  where  the  victims  were  trafficked  or  whether  some \nof  the  means  used  to  compel  the  labor  occurred  abroad.’s  It  is  undisputed \nthat  Plaintiffs  were  trafficked  from  India  to  the  United  States  and  performed \nlabor  for  Signal  while  in  the  United  States. \nThese  facts  distinguish  this  case  from  others  in  which  courts  have \ndismissed  pre-amendment  TVPA  claims  as  extraterritorial.  In  those  cases, \nthe  alleged  trafficking  occurred  outside  the  United  States.?  For  example,  in \nAdhikan  v.  Daoud  &  Partners—cited  heavily  in  Signal's  brief—the  plaintiffs \nalleged  a  scheme  to  traffic  workers  from  Nepali  to  Iraq.s \nll.  Financial  Harm  as  “Serious  Harm” \nThe  pre-amendment  version  of  Section  1589  of  the  TVPA  proscribed  the \nknowing  provision  of  labor  by  “threats  of  serious  harm  to,  or  physical \nrestraint  against,  [the  victim].9  The  new  version  of  Section  1589  reads \nsimilarly  and  prohibits  the  knowing  provision  of  labor  by  “means  of  serious \nharm  or  threats  of  serious  harm  to  [the  victim].\"i9c  Unlike  pre-amendment \nSection  1589,  the  new  version  contains  a  broad  definition  of  “serious \nharm,”  which  includes  “financial”  harm.13  Signal  argues  the  addition  of  this \ndefinition  demonstrates  that  “serious  harm’  under  pre-amendment  Section \n1589  did  not  include  financial  harm.  The  Court  disagrees  for  muitiple \nreasons. \n*s  First,  Signal’s  argument  belies  the  plain  language  of  the  statute.  That  the \npre-amendment  version  distinguished  between  “serious  harm”  and \n“physical  restraint”  suggests  “Congress  intended  that  serious  harm  not  be \nlimited  to  physical  harm,  and  instead  include  at  least  some  non-physical \nharm,  @.g.,  financial  harm.”i2  Moreover,  “[s|tandard  definitions  of  ‘harm’  do \nnot  restrict  the  term  to  physical  harm,  but  also  encompass  economic \ninjury.\"78  Second,  the  legislative  history  suggests  Congress  intended  pre- \namendment  Section  1589  to  cover  a  “broad  array  of  harms,”  such  as \ncausing  the  victim  to  believe  he  or  she  would  face  “bankruptcy  in  their \nhome  country.\"14  Third,  at  least  two  courts  have  squarely  held  that \n“financial  harm  was  cognizable  as  serious  harm  prior  to  the  December  23, \n2008  amendment.\"i8  This  Court  joins  their  lead  and  holds  that  serious\nharm  under  pre-amendment  Section  1589  includes  financial  harm. \nlll.  Scienter \nin  order  to  prevail  under  pre-amendment  Section  1589,  a  plaintiff  must \nprove  the  defendant  knowingly  provided  or  obtained  labor  in  one  of  three \nways: \n(1)  by  threats  of  serious  harm  to,  or  physical  restraint  against,  that  person \nor  another  person; \n(2)  by  means  of  any  scheme,  plan,  or  pattern  intended  to  cause  the  person \nto  believe  that,  if  the  person  did  not  perform  such  labor  or  services,  that \nperson  or  another  person  would  suffer  serious  harm  or  physical  restraint;  or \n(3)  by  means  of  the  abuse  or  threatened  abuse  of  law  or  the  legal  process \nSignal  argues  there  is  no  evidence  it  acted  with  the  requisite  intent.  The \nCourt  disagrees.  Plaintiffs  have  introduced  evidence  from  which  a  jury \ncould  infer  Signal  knowingly  threatened  immigration  consequences  in  order \nto  maintain  its  labor  force.:?  Plaintiffs  have  also  introduced  evidence \ntending  to  establish  Signal  was  aware  tts  workers  had  limited  financial \nresources  and  intentionally  leveraged  this  situation  to  its  advantage.is \nAccordingly,  there  are  genuine  issues  of  material  fact,  which  preclude  the \nentry  of  summary  judgment. \nFor  the  reasons  previously  stated; \niT  (S  ORDERED  that  the  Motion  is  DENIED  in  its  entirety.\n",

      "text": "Case 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 22   Filed 03/31/14   Page 1 of 6\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI\nSOUTHERN DIVISION\nSINGH, ET AL. PLAINTIFFS\nv. CAUSE NO. 1:13CV393LG-JMR\nSIGNAL INT’L, LLC, ET AL. DEFENDANTS\nORDER TRANSFERRING CASE TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT \nCOURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA\nBEFORE THE COURT is the Motion [10] for Transfer and to partially\ndismiss filed by Signal International, Inc. and Signal International, LLC (“Signal”). \nSignal argues that this case should be transferred to the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Louisiana, where a substantially similar case was\nfirst filed and is pending.  The Motion is opposed by the plaintiffs, who argue that\nthe parties and issues in the cases neither completely nor substantially overlap. \nAfter due consideration, the Court concludes that this case should be transferred to\nthe United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.  Accordingly,\nthe Motion to transfer will be granted.  The Court declines to rule on any remaining\nmotions, leaving them for determination by the transferee court.  \nBACKGROUND\nSignal seeks transfer of this case to the Eastern District of Louisiana,\narguing that this case is closely related to a similar lawsuit filed in the Eastern\nDistrict of Louisiana in March 2008, David, et al. v. Signal, et al., No. 2:08-CV-\n1220-JCZ-DEK (\"David\").  Signal submits that under the “first filed” rule, this case\n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 22   Filed 03/31/14   Page 2 of 6\nshould be transferred so that the issues it presents can be resolved with David.  The\nCourt has previously transferred four cases to the Eastern District of Louisiana on\nthis basis.1\nThe Eastern District of Louisiana district judge summarized the David\nplaintiffs’ claims as alleging a scheme to lure foreign workers to work for Signal in\nMississippi and Texas with the promise of permanent residence in the United\nStates.  Once in the United States, the David plaintiffs alleged they were subjected\nto discrimination and adverse working and living conditions.  The plaintiffs allege\nthat the recruitment defendants obtained millions of dollars in fees and Signal\nobtained workers for a lesser cost than if it hired American workers.  David, Order\n& Reasons at 4, Jan. 4, 2012 (denying motion to certify class).\nSignal is one of twelve defendants in David.2  The plaintiffs in David are a\nnumber of Indian nationals who were Signal employees.  Their Third Amended\nComplaint asserts violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\nOrganizations Act (RICO), the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act\n1 Achari v. Signal, No 1:13cv222-LG-JMR; Chakkiyattl v. Signal, No.\n1:13cv318-LG-JMR, Krishnakutty v. Signal, No. 1:13cv319-LG-JMR, and Devassy v.\nSignal, 1:13cv327-HSO-RHW. \n2  The David Defendants are: Signal International L.L.C; Malvern C.\nBurnett; Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, L.L.C.; Law Offices of Malvern C.\nBurnett, A.P.C.; Indo-Ameri Soft L.L.C.; Kurella Rao; J & M Associates, Inc. of\nMississippi; Billy R. Wilks; J & M Marine & Industrial, L.L.C.; Global Resources,\nInc.; Michael Pol; Sachin Dewan; and Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd. (a/k/a MedTech\nConsultants).  Signal has also filed claims against a third-party defendant, Zito\nCompanies, LLC.\n-2-\n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 22   Filed 03/31/14   Page 3 of 6\n(TVPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1981, 42 U.S.C. § 1985, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA),\nand claims of fraud/negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract.  Several\nplaintiffs also bring individual claims of retaliation under § 1981 and § 1985, and\nclaims of false imprisonment, assault, battery, and infliction of emotional distress.  \nThe plaintiffs in this case are three Indian nationals, and they were\npreviously among the plaintiffs in the David case who sought to be certified as a\nclass.  After class certification was denied by the Louisiana district court, they filed\ncomplaints in this Court, but they also remain among the plaintiffs in the collective\nFair Labor Standards Act claim in David.  They allege in this case that Signal,\nthrough recruiters, lured them to the United States to work in deplorable,\ndiscriminatory conditions with the promise of permanent U.S. residency.  (Compl. 1-\n5, ECF No. 1).  They assert claims of violation of the TVPA, 42 U.S.C. § 1981,\nfraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract. \nThe defendants are Signal, Global Resources, Inc., Malvern C. Burnett, Law Offices\nof Malvern Burnett, APC, Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, LLC, Dewan\nConsultants Pvt. Ltd. (a/k/a Medtech Consultants), and Sachin Dewan. \nDISCUSSION\nThe “first to file” rule permits a district court to decline jurisdiction over an\naction when it involves the same parties and issues as a previously-filed action in\nanother court.  When related cases are pending before two federal courts, the court\nin which the case was last filed may dismiss or transfer the case if it involves\nsubstantially similar issues which can be resolved in the earlier-filed action. See W.\n-3-\n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 22   Filed 03/31/14   Page 4 of 6\nGulf Mar. Ass'n v. ILA Deep Sea Local 24, 751 F.2d 721, 728-29 (5th Cir. 1985) and\nSave Power Ltd. v. Syntek Fin. Corp., 121 F.3d 947, 950 (5th Cir. 1997).  “The\nconcern manifestly is to avoid the waste of duplication, to avoid rulings which may\ntrench upon the authority of sister courts, and to avoid piecemeal resolution of\nissues that call for a uniform result.”  W. Gulf Mar. Ass'n, 751 F.2d at 728. \nThe Court's inquiry is focused on whether the cases substantially overlap, but\nwhere the overlap is “less than complete, the judgment is made case by case, based\non such factors as the extent of overlap, the likelihood of conflict, the comparative\nadvantage and the interest of each forum in resolving the dispute.” Save Power Ltd.,\n121 F.3d at 951.  The first-to-file rule is a discretionary doctrine.  Cadle Co. v.\nWhataburger of Alice, Inc., 174 F.3d 599, 603 (5th Cir. 1999) (citing Kerotest Mfg.\nCo. v. C-O-Two Fire Equip. Co., 342 U.S. 180, 183-84 (1952)).  It is not a rigid or\ninflexible rule to be mechanically applied.  Mann Mfg., Inc. v. Hortex, Inc., 439 F.2d\n403, 407 (5th Cir. 1971).  The decision of whether to apply the first-to-file rule\ninvolves determinations concerning “[w]ise judicial administration, giving regard to\nconservation of judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of litigation.” \nKerotest, 342 U.S. at 183.  \nIn support of its motion, Signal asserts that there are no differences between\nthis case and the four cases this Court transferred earlier to the Eastern District of\nLouisiana in Achari v. Signal Int’l, LLC, No. 1:13cv222-LG-JMR, 2013 WL 5705660\n(Oct. 18, 2013). \n-4-\n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 22   Filed 03/31/14   Page 5 of 6\nIn response, the plaintiffs argue that the Court’s earlier decision in Achari\ndoes not compel the same decision in this case, because any decision must be made\non a “case by case” basis when the overlap is less than complete.  Plaintiffs urge the\nCourt to decide this issue consistently with a district court in the Eastern District of\nTexas, which denied transfer to the Eastern District of Louisiana in two cases\nbrought by former Signal employees who had been denied class certification but\nremained as FLSA plaintiffs in David.  In both Samuel v. Signal Int’l, LLC, No.\n1:13-cv-323 (E. D. Tex. Dec 2, 2013) and Joseph v. Signal Int’l LLC, No 1:13cv324\n(E.D. Tex. Feb. 11, 2014), the court found there was not a substantial overlap of the\nclaims between the David litigation and the cases that had been filed in the Eastern\nDistrict of Texas, and with the exception of the plaintiffs’ FLSA claims in David,\nnone of the Samuel, Joseph and David plaintiffs overlapped. \nNevertheless, this Court finds that there is substantial overlap of parties and\nissues such that this case should be decided by the David court.  The fact that the\nplaintiffs are no longer parties to all of the claims in the David case does not negate\nthe presence of many defendants in common.  All of the defendants in this case are\nalso named in David.  \nFurther, the issues are almost identical.  In the two cases, the plaintiffs\nallege a human trafficking scheme that induced them to emigrate from India with\nthe unfulfilled promise of permanent United States residency, and the imposition of\nadverse working and living conditions.  All of the theories of recovery in this case\n-5-\n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 22   Filed 03/31/14   Page 6 of 6\nare also presented in the David case.  The David plaintiffs allege the same human\ntrafficking, the same unfulfilled promises, and the same deplorable working\nconditions.  There is a possibility of inconsistent judgments on the same subject\nmatter if these three former employees proceed with their claims here, while their\nformer co-employees pursue the same claims in David.  “And even if the possibility\nof incompatible judgments were ignored, there remains the unavoidable duplication\nof effort in having separate courts work to arrive at the same decision.”  White v.\nPeco Foods, Inc., 546 F. Supp. 2d 339, 343 (S.D. Miss. 2008).\nFor these reasons, the Court finds that transfer to the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Louisiana is appropriate.  \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Motion [10] to\nTransfer Pursuant to First-Filed Rule filed by Signal International, LLC, is\nGRANTED.  The above-captioned consolidated case is TRANSFERRED to the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.\nSO ORDERED AND ADJUDGED this the 31st day of March, 2014.\nLouis Guirola, Jr.\ns/  \nLOUIS GUIROLA, JR.\nCHIEF U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE\n-6-",

Signal (14-2826) \n     \nORDER AND REASONS \n \n  Before the Court are the Dewan Defendants’ Motions for Summary Judgment on \nthe crossclaims of Co-Defendant Signal International, LLC (“Signal”).1 Signal opposes the \nMotions.2 The Dewan Defendants have also filed reply memoranda in further support of \nthe Motions for Summary Judgment. The Court has considered these briefs, the record, \nand the applicable law, and now issues its ruling. For the reasons that follow, the Motions \nfor Summary Judgment are GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.  \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n  This matter arises out of an allegedly unlawful recruitment scheme used by Signal \nto recruit and employ citizens of India in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.3 Plaintiffs, \n                                                   \n1 This Order and Reasons applies to the identical Motions for Summary Judgment currently pending in \nDavid v. Signal (08-1220), R. Docs. 2396, 2397; Achari v. Signal (13-6218), R. Docs. 504, 507; Samuel v. \nSignal (14-2811), R. Docs. 219, 220; and Joseph v. Signal (14-2826), R. Docs. 216, 217. The motions were \noriginally filed by Defendant Malvern C. Burnett, the Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, LLC, and the \nLaw Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, APC (“the Burnett Defendants”).  Defendants Sachin Dewan and Dewan \nConsultants, Pvt. Ltd. (“the Dewan Defendants”), thereafter joined in the motions. The Burnett Defendants \nare no longer defendants to this action. Accordingly, for purposes of this Order and Reasons, the Court \ntreats the Motions for Summary Judgment solely as that of the Dewan Defendants.  \n2 R. Doc. 513 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). For simplicity, the Court, where necessary, refers to the \nMotions for Summary Judgment and related briefs by citing the document numbers assigned those filings \nin Achari v. Signal (13-6218). The document numbers related to the Motions in the other relevant cases are \nreflected, supra, in footnote 1. \n3 See generally R. Doc. 200 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n2 \n \n\na number of the recruited Indian workers, allege that Signal, among others, recruited \nPlaintiffs  to  work  at  Signal’s  facilities  in  Pascagoula,  Mississippi,  post-Hurricane \nKatrina.4 Signal allegedly promised Plaintiffs that, in connection with the recruitment \nscheme, it would assist Plaintiffs in acquiring permanent residence in the United States.5 \nPlaintiffs contend, however, that Signal never followed through with these promises or \ntook steps to assist Plaintiffs in obtaining green cards.6 Moreover, Plaintiffs argue, inter \nalia, that they experienced discriminatory treatment at the hands of Signal and were \nforced to live in deplorable conditions.7  \n  The present Motions for Summary Judgment concern the crossclaims levied by \nSignal against the Burnett Defendants and the Dewan Defendants in (1) David v. Signal \n(08-1220); (2) the consolidated cases in Achari v. Signal (13-6218);8 (3) Samuel v. Signal \n(14-2811); and (4) Joseph v. Signal (14-2826). Judgment was entered on the crossclaims \nin  the  first  David  trial9  against  Signal  and  in  favor  of  the  Burnett  and  Dewan \nDefendants.10 The Dewan Defendants contend in the present Motions that, because \n“identical” crossclaims were alleged and adjudicated in the first David trial,11 Signal’s \n                                                   \n4 R. Doc. 200 at 4–5 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n5 R. Doc. 200 at 6 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n6 R. Doc. 200 at 6–7 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n7 R. Doc. 200 at 7 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n8 Signal filed crossclaims against the Burnett and Dewan Defendants in each of the cases consolidated in \nAchari v. Signal. These consolidated cases, along with the document number of Signal’s crossclaims in \nthose cases, include: Thomas v. Signal (14-1818), R. Doc. 370 (E.D. La.); Achari v. Signal (13-6218), R. \nDoc. 642 (E.D. La.); Chakkiyattil v. Signal (13-6219), R. Doc. 643 (E.D. La.); Krishnakutty v. Signal (13-\n6220), R. Doc. 644 (E.D. La.); Devassy v. Signal (13-6221), R. Doc. 645 (E.D. La.); Singh v. Signal (14-\n732), R. Doc. 646 (E.D. La.). \n9 The first David trial involved only 5 of the Plaintiffs in David. The claims of the remaining 7 Plaintiffs \nagainst the Dewan Defendants, as well as Signal’s related crossclaims against the Dewan Defendants, \nremain pending in David. \n10 R. Doc. 504 at 2 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218); R. Doc. 504-1 at 2–3 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n11 Counts 1 through 8 were resolved prior to trial when the Court granted judgment as a matter of law in \nfavor of the Burnett and Dewan Defendants. See David v. Signal (08-1220), R. Doc. 2265. The jury found \nin favor of the Burnett and Dewan Defendants on the indemnity crossclaims. See David v. Signal (08-1220), \nR. Doc. 2268-2 at 78–83. \n3 \n \n\ncrossclaims  in  David—with  respect  to  the  remaining  David  Plaintiffs—and  in  the \nconsolidated Achari cases, as well as the Samuel and Joseph cases, are barred by the \ndoctrine of res judicata. \nLEGAL STANDARDS \nA.  Summary Judgment Standard \n  Summary judgment is appropriate only “if the movant shows that there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter \nof law.”12 “An issue is material if its resolution could affect the outcome of the action.”13 \nWhen assessing whether a material factual dispute exists, the Court considers “all of the \nevidence in the record but refrains from making credibility determinations or weighing \nthe evidence.”14 All reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the non-moving party.15 \nThere is no genuine issue of material fact if, even viewing the evidence in the light most \nfavorable to the non-moving party, no reasonable trier of fact could find for the non-\nmoving party, thus entitling the moving party to judgment as a matter of law.16   \nB.  Res Judicata Standard \n“Under the doctrine of res judicata, parties and their privies are precluded from \nrelitigating claims that were or should have been raised in a prior action and have reached \na  final  judgment  on  the  merits.”17  For  the  doctrine  of  res  judicata  to  apply,  four \nrequirements must be satisfied: (1) the parties must be identical in both suits, or the \n                                                   \n12 Fed.

Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir. 1994). \n16 Smith v. Amedisys, Inc., 298 F.3d 434, 440 (5th Cir. 2002). \n17 Metro Charities, Inc. v. Moore, 748 F. Supp. 1156, 1159 (S.D. Miss 1990) (citing Federated Dep’t Stores, \nInc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394, 398 (1981)). See also Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94 (1980) (“The doctrine \nof res judicata, or claim preclusion, forecloses relitigation of claims that were or could have been raised in \na prior action.”). \n4 \n \n\nparties must be in privity with parties who were identical in both suits; (2) the prior \njudgment must have been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (3) the prior \njudgment must have been a final judgment on the merits; and (4) the same claim or cause \nof action must be involved in both suits.18 \nDISCUSSION \nIt is undisputed that the first two requirements of the res judicata analysis are \nsatisfied in this case.19 The Dewan Defendants and Signal agree that (1) the parties in the \ncrossclaims are identical or in privity; and (2) the crossclaims in the first David trial were \ndecided by a court of competent jurisdiction. The principal disputes with respect to the \npresent Motions for Summary Judgment concern the third and fourth requirements of \nthe res judicata analysis. The Court will address each requirement, in turn, below. \nA.  Final Judgment on the Merits \nThe third requirement of the res judicata inquiry, as recited above, requires that \nthe prior judgment be a final judgment on the merits.20 The Dewan Defendants contend \nit is “self evident” that the prior judgment on Signal’s crossclaims in the first David trial \nis final and on the merits, noting that a “verdict was issued as a result of a trial o[n] the \nmerits and Judgment was issued pursuant to Rule 54(b).”21 Signal, on the other hand, \ndisputes the assertion that the first David trial resulted in  a final judgment on its \ncrossclaims.22 Signal argues that, because it has appealed the Court’s judgment on its \ncrossclaims, the judgment is not final for purposes of res judicata.23 More specifically, \n                                                   \n18 See, e.g., Swate v. Hartwell (In re Swate), 99 F.3d 1282, 1286 (5th Cir. 1996);  \n19 R. Doc. 504-2 at 4–5 (in the Achari cases); R. Doc. 513 at 4 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n20 See supra note 18 and accompanying text. \n21 R. Doc. 504-2 at 5 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n22 R. Doc. 513 at 5 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n23 R. Doc. 513 at 5 (in the Achari cases). Signal states that the pendency of its appeal should “defeat” the \nfinality argument. R. Doc. 513 at 5 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n5 \n \n\nSignal  contends  the  pendency  of  an  appeal  renders  the  appealed-from  judgment \n“insufficiently final” for res judicata purposes.  \nUnder Fifth Circuit case law, it is immaterial for res judicata purposes that a prior \njudgment has been appealed. The Fifth Circuit has specifically held that “[a] case pending \nappeal is res judicata and entitled to full faith and credit unless and until reversed on \nappeal.”24 Signal’s argument to the contrary, that its taking of an appeal renders the \nCourt’s judgment “insufficiently final,” is incorrect.25 Signal’s appeal has, for res judicata \npurposes, no bearing on the finality of the Court’s judgment on Signal’s crossclaims in the \nfirst David trial. As a result, the Court finds the third requirement of the res judicata \ninquiry satisfied. The judgment on Signal’s crossclaims in the first David trial is, for \npurposes of res judicata, final and on the merits. The Court now turns to the fourth \nrequirement. \nB.   Same Claims or Causes of Action \nThe fourth requirement of the res judicata inquiry, as recited above, requires that \nthe same claims or causes of action be involved in both suits.26 To determine whether two \nsuits involve the same claims or causes of action, the Fifth Circuit instructs courts to use \nthe “transactional test” of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments, § 24.27 Under the \n                                                   \n24 Comer v. Murphy Oil USA, 718 F.3d 460, 467 (5th Cir. 2013) (quoting Fid. Standard Life Ins. Co. v. First \nNat’l Bank & Trust Co., 510 F.2d 272, 273 (5th Cir. 1975) (per curiam)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nSee also United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 39 (1950); 18A CHARLES A. WRIGHT & ARTHUR D. \nMILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 4427 (2d ed. 2012). \n25 Signal cites Griggs v. United States, 253 F. App’x 405 (5th Cir. 2007), for the proposition that a judgment, \nwhen appealed, is insufficiently final for res judicata purposes. R. Doc. 513 at 5–6. Signal’s reliance on \nGriggs for this conclusion is inapposite. Griggs does not hold that a judgment, if appealed, is not final for \nres judicata purposes. Instead, the Fifth Circuit in Griggs noted, in dicta, that a judgment, which is not \nappealed, is final, though that judgment may be erroneous or based on law that is no longer controlling.

Charles \nHouse Corp., 742 F.2d 862, 870–71 (5th Cir. 1984)); see also Petro-Hunt, L.L.C. v. U.S., 365 F.3d 385, 395–\n96 (5th Cir. 2004). \n6 \n \n\ntransactional test, a prior judgment’s preclusive effect extends “to all or any part of the \ntransaction,  or  series  of  connected  transactions,  out  of  which  the  [original]  action \narose.”28 Which grouping of facts constitutes a “transaction” or a “series of transactions” \nmust “be determined pragmatically, giving weight to such considerations as whether the \nfacts are related in time, space, origin, or motivation, whether they form a convenient trial \nunit, and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties’ expectations or \nbusiness understanding or usage.”29 The critical issue under the transactional test is \nwhether the two actions or suits are based on the “same nucleus of operative facts.”30  \nIn the first David trial, Signal’s crossclaims were enumerated in 10 separate \ncounts.31 Counts 1 through 8 were Signal’s crossclaims for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, \nmalpractice, two counts of breach of contract, unfair trade practices, detrimental reliance, \nand tortious interference with a contractual relationship.32 Counts 9 and 10 were Signal’s \ncrossclaims for indemnity against the Burnett and Dewan Defendants.33 Signal does not \ndispute that Counts 1 through 8 arise out of the “same nucleus of operative facts” as its \ncorresponding, non-indemnity crossclaims in the remaining portion of the David case, \nthe  consolidated  Achari  cases,  and  the  Samuel  and  Joseph  cases.34  Indeed,  Signal \nconcedes that its non-indemnity crossclaims in these cases satisfy the fourth requirement \nof the res judicata inquiry and involve the same claims or causes of action as Signal’s non-\n                                                   \n28 Petro-Hunt, 365 F.3d at 395–96 (quoting RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF JUDGMENTS § 24(1) (1982)) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). \n29 Id.

Prior to the trial in David, the Court dismissed Counts \n1 through 8 of Signal’s crossclaims, granting the Burnett and Dewan Defendants judgment as a matter of \nlaw. David v. Signal (08-1220), R. Doc. 2265. \n33 David v. Signal (08-1220), R. Doc. 1748 at 102–104. \n34 See R. Doc. 513 at 8–9 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n7 \n \n\nindemnity crossclaims adjudicated in the first David trial. Because the parties agree that \nthe first and second requirements of the res judicata analysis are met, and because the \nCourt has found that the third and fourth requirements are met, Signal’s non-indemnity \ncrossclaims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata as a result of the judgment in the \nfirst David trial. \nThe indemnity counts of Signal’s crossclaims—Counts 9 and 10 in the first David \ntrial—require a more lengthy and involved analysis.35 Signal argues, in sum, that its \nindemnity crossclaims against the Burnett and Dewan Defendants in the first David trial \nwere not based on the same nucleus of operative facts as Signal’s indemnity crossclaims \nin the remaining portion of the David case, the consolidated Achari cases, and the Samuel \nand Joseph cases.36 Signal contends its crossclaims for indemnity necessarily involve facts \nspecific to each individual Plaintiff and that the “facts surrounding a given Plaintiff’s \nrecruitment” are dispositive of Signal’s crossclaims for indemnity in each particular \ncase.37 As such, Signal avers that, because facts specific to the remaining Plaintiffs in \nDavid,  the  Plaintiffs  in  Achari,  and  the  Plaintiffs  in  Samuel  and  Joseph  were  not \npresented and adjudicated at the first David trial, Signal’s indemnity crossclaims should \nnot be barred by the doctrine of res judicata.38 \nThe Dewan Defendants, on the other hand, argue that, with respect to Signal’s \nindemnity crossclaims, “the category of damages, the alleged basis of recovery, and the \noperative facts on which [Signal] bases its claim for recovery are the same as presented in \nDavid.”39  The  Dewan  Defendants  maintain  the  “only  difference”  is  the  “amount  of \n                                                   \n35 See R. Doc. 513 at 9 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218).  \n36 See R. Doc. 513 at 9–10 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n37 R. Doc. 513 at 9–12 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n38 R. Doc. 513 at 13–14 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n39 R. Doc. 504-2 at 11 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n8 \n \n\ndamages, if any, for which Signal may be held responsible.”40 The Dewan Defendants do \nnot agree that Signal’s indemnity crossclaims against the Burnett and Dewan Defendants \nare “plaintiff specific” and turn on the particular facts surrounding the recruitment of \neach Plaintiff.  \nThe  Court  agrees  with  Signal.  Signal’s  crossclaims  for  indemnity  against  the \nBurnett and Dewan Defendants do require a “plaintiff-specific” analysis. In reaching this \nconclusion, the Court notes that, in the first David trial, the portion of the Jury Verdict \nForm which addressed Signal’s crossclaims for indemnity against the Burnett and Dewan \nDefendants required an analysis of the facts and circumstances unique to the Plaintiffs in \nthat case.41 Specifically, with respect to Signal’s indemnity crossclaims, the Jury Verdict \nForm referenced the “legal obligation” owed by Signal to the “Plaintiffs in the main \naction” and whether, “in all fairness,” the Burnett or Dewan Defendants should indemnify \nSignal for that legal obligation owed by Signal to those specific Plaintiffs.42 Accordingly, \nin reaching a verdict on Signal’s indemnity crossclaims in the first David trial, the jury \nwas required to consider the specific circumstances and testimony of the Plaintiffs and \ndetermine whether the Burnett and Dewan Defendants were required to indemnify Signal \nfor  Signal’s  conduct  with  respect  to  those  five  David  Plaintiffs  whose  claims  were \npresented in the first trial. \nAt the first David trial and, specifically, during cross examination, Signal elicited \ntestimony from each Plaintiff as to the conduct of the Burnett and Dewan Defendants and \nhow each Plaintiff’s experience with Burnett and Dewan was unique and distinct. For \nexample, each Plaintiff was asked about unauthorized actions of Burnett and Dewan that \n                                                   \n40 R. Doc. 504-2 at 11–12 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n41 See David v. Signal (08-1220), R. Doc. 2268-2 at 78–83. \n42 See David v. Signal (08-1220), R. Doc. 2268-2 at 78–83 (emphasis added). \n9 \n \n\nwere relevant to whether the Burnett and Dewan Defendants would be required to \nindemnify Signal for Signal’s conduct vis-à-vis those David Plaintiffs. \nThe Court is not persuaded by the argument, set forth by the Dewan Defendants, \nthat Signal’s indemnity crossclaims involve only an assessment of Signal’s and the Burnett \nand Dewan Defendants’ conduct vis-à-vis each other.43 As stated above, whether the \nBurnett and Dewan Defendants were required by law to indemnify Signal in the first \nDavid trial turned on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the individual \nPlaintiffs  in  that  trial.  Signal’s  indemnity  crossclaims  in  the  first  David  trial  are \nnecessarily distinct and do not involve the same claims or causes of action as Signal’s \nindemnity crossclaims in the remaining portion of David, the consolidated Achari cases, \nor the Samuel or Joseph cases. Signal’s crossclaims for indemnity against the Burnett and \nDewan Defendants are not barred by the doctrine of res judicata. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Signal’s crossclaims for indemnity \nagainst  the  Dewan  Defendants  in  the  remaining  portion  of  the  David  case,  the \nconsolidated Achari cases, and the Samuel and Joseph cases are not barred by the \ndoctrine of res judicata. Signal’s non-indemnity crossclaims are barred under the doctrine \nof res judicata. \n  Accordingly; \n  IT IS ORDERED that the Dewan Defendants’ Motions for Summary Judgment44 \nare hereby GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Signal’s non-indemnity \ncrossclaims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Signal’s crossclaims for indemnity \n                                                   \n43 See R. Doc. 524 at 5–6 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n44 R. Doc. 504 (in the Achari cases) (13-6218). \n10 \n \n\nagainst the Burnett and Dewan Defendants are, for the reasons stated above, not barred \nby the doctrine of res judicata. \nNew Orleans, Louisiana, this 1st day of December, 2015. \n \n_______ _____________ _______ \nSUSIE MORGAN \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n11 \n ",

Plaintiffs are part of a group of hundreds of Indian men who were trafficked into \nthe United States in the wake of Hurricane Katrina as an exploitable source of cheap labor for \nDefendants  Signal  International,  LLC,  Signal  International,  Inc.,  and/or their  subsidiaries  or \naffiliates  (collectively,  \"Signal\").  Signal  and  the  other Defendants  worked  together and  in \nconcert to  defraud Plaintiffs out of thousands of dollars from  Plaintiffs'  limited resources; to \nfalsely promise them assistance in applying for and obtaining permanent residency in the United \nStates; to traffic them into the United States; to force them to live in: prison-like camps in squalid \nand  unsanitary  conditions; to  discriminate against them on the basis of their race,  ethnicity, \nreligion,  and  alienage;  and  to  threaten  them  with  financial  ruin  and  adverse  immigration \nconsequences if they complained. \n1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 2 of 47\n, \n2.  Plaintiffs  Pravin  Kumar  Singh  and  Radhakrishnan  Nair  Mangalathumalayil \nVasukuttan, each a former employee of Signal, bring this action to recover damages for this \nunlawful  and  fraudulent  conduct  by  Signal  and  its  agents  and  co-conspirators  Malvern  C. \nBurnett, the Law Offices of Malvern C.  Burnett, APC, Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, \nLLC, Sachin Dewan, Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd., and Global Resources, Inc.  Plaintiffs bring \n. claims against these Defendants under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act \n(\"TVPRA\") of 2003 (18 U.S.C. § 1595); the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.c. § 1981); and \nthe  laws  of  Mississippi  and  any  other  applicable  jurisdiction  for  fraud,  negligent \nmisrepresentation, and breach of contract. \n3.  In  the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina,  Signal, a Gulf-Coast based marine and \nfabrication company, set out to recruit hundreds ofindian welders and fitters to work in Signal's \nfacilities in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and Orange, Texas.  To assist in this process and recruit \nworkers  on  Signal's  behalf,  Signal  relied  on  its  agents  and  co-conspirators  (hereinafter \ncollectively  referred  to  as  the  \"Recruiter Defendants\"):  Defendants  Global  Resources,  Inc. \n(\"Global Resources\"), a Mississippi labor-recruitment firm;  Defendant Malvern C.  Burnett, an \nimmigration attorney with offices in Mississippi and Louisiana, and the principal and registered \nagent of Defendants Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, APC and Gulf Coast Immigration Law \nCenter,  LLC;  and  Defendants  Sachin Dewan (\"Dewan\"),  a  labor recruiter in  India,  and  his \ncompany Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd. (\"Dewan Consultants\"). \n4.  Defendants devised and participated in a scheme and venture to recruit low-cost \nforeign workers, including Plaintiffs, in India and the United Arab Emirates through the false \npromise of permanent residency in the United States.  In the words of one of the Defendants' \nadvertisements, this promise entailed a \"[j]ob guarantee\" of \"2-3 years\" and \"permanent lifetime \n2 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 3 of 47\nsettlement in the  U.S.A.  for  self and  family.\"  Defendants  Dewan and  his  company Dewan \nConsultants,  acting  on  behalf of Signal  and  in  concert with  the  other  Defendants, promised \nPlaintiffs and other Indian workers that they would obtain employment and receive \"green cards\" \n(i. e., permanent residency) in the United States if they paid thousands of dollars that amounted to \nyears of these workers' average income. \n5.  Despite this promise and the substantial fees charged, Defendants had no intention \nof securing long-term employment or green cards for Plaintiffs.  No Defendant took any step to \napply for or help secure permanent residency status in the United States for Plaintiffs. \n6.  Lured  by  these  fraudulent  promises,  Plaintiffs  plunged  themselves  and  their \nfamilies into debt and sold prized personal possessions to pay the mandatory \"recruitment fees\" \ncharged  hy  the  Recruiter  Defendants  totaling  over  $16,000  per  worker,  an  amount  that \nconstituted a fortune for Plaintiffs, who did not even come close to making that much in a year's \nworth of income.  Trusting the veracity of the immigration and work henefits promised, Plaintiff \nPravin Kumar Singh also  relinquished stable employment in Dubai.  Each Plaintiff paid the \nRecruiter  Defendants  in  reasonable  reliance  on  their  promises  and  assurances  of long-term \nemployment and permanent residency in the United States. \n7.  After receiving thousands of dollars from Plaintiffs as a result of these fraudulent \npromises, Defendants' main recruiting agent or partner in India and the United Arab Emirates, \nDewan Consultants, told  Plaintiffs that,  because the permanent residency process could  take \nyears to complete and Signal's need for workers was immediate, Defendants would first assist \nPlaintiffs in obtaining temporary work visas, known as H-2B visas, while also applying for green \ncards.  Each Plaintiff reasonably believed what he was told and paid the Recruiter Defendants, \n3 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 4 of 47\nwhich acted as Signal's agents and co-conspirators, with the expectation of obtaining pennanent \nresidency for themselves and for their families in the United States through work for Signal. \n8.  Upon  Plaintiffs'  arrival  in  the  United  States,  Signal  required  them  and  other \nIndian workers to live in fenced, guarded, overcrowded, and isolated camps.  Signal called these \ncamps \"the Reservation(s).\"  It had two  such camps, one  in Pascagoula, Mississippi,  where \nPlaintiff Singh was taken in January 2007, and one in Orange, Texas, where PlaintiffVasukuttan \nwas taken that same month.  In these camps, Plaintiffs had to endure degrading and prison-like \nconditions.  They  were  among  several  hundred  Indian  nationals  crammed  into  trailer-like \nbunkhouses that were far too small for the number of men housed in them, and otherwise unfit \nfor human habitation.  Privacy was non-existent.  Toilet and bathing facilities were insufficient. \nThe food provided was not fit for consumption and caused Plaintiffs stomachaches and diarrhea. \n\"Security guards\" patrolled the grounds like prison guards and subjected the Indian workers to \nsearches of their persons and belongings. \n9.  To live in these prison-like conditions, Signal deducted a mandatory room-and-\nboard fee of roughly $1,050 USD per month from Plaintiffs' paychecks.  When Indian workers \nrequested permission to live off-site, they were told by Signal that they could do  so, but that \nSignal would continue to deduct that amount.  Signal thus  financially compelled Plaintiffs to \nremain in its so-called \"Reservations.\"  Non-Indian workers were not subjected to such squalid \nliving conditions, degrading treatment, or extortionate room-and-board policies. \n10.  Signal's discriminatory and oppressive treatment of Plaintiffs and the other Indian \nworkers  was  not  limited  to  the  housing  conditions  imposed  on  them.  Signal  fostered  an \natmosphere of fear among the Indian workers, who risked retaliation if they tried to improve \ntheir  conditions.  On  March  9,  2007,  for  example,  Signal,  using  private  security  guards, \n4 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 5 of 47\nattempted  to  deport  several  workers  in  retaliation  for  speaking  out  against  discriminatory \nconditions  in  Signal's  labor  camp  in  Pascagoula,  Mississippi,  and  for  seeking  counsel  to \nunderstand their legal  rights.  This  incident and  other threats  of suspension,  dismissal,  and \ndeportation-compounded with the debt and hardships endured to pay the Recruiter Defendants' \n\"fees\"-compelled Plaintiffs to remain in Signal's camps and to work for Signal despite Signal's \nexploitation until it terminated their employment. \n11.  In  sum,  Defendants, individually and jointly, conspired and schemed to target \nPlaintiffs as Indian laborers, knowing that they would be enticed by false promises of permanent \nresidency, to lure them into the United States only to  be abused and discriminated against by \nSignal.  As a result of these abuses, Plaintiffs are entitled to relief under the TVPRA, the Civil \nRights Act of 1866, and the laws of this state and of any other applicable jurisdiction. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal-\nquestion jurisdiction), 28 U.S.c. § 1343 (civil rights), and 28 U.S.c. § 1367 (pendent state-law \nclaims).  Supplemental jurisdiction is  proper under 28  U.S.c.  § 1367  because the state-law \nclaims asserted herein arise out of the same nucleus of operative facts that support Plaintiffs' \nfederal claims. \n13.  This  Court  has  personal  jurisdiction  over  Defendants.  Signal  maintains  a \ncontinuing business presence in Mississippi, including but not limited to at least one shipyard in \nPascagoula, Mississippi, where one of the Plaintiffs worked for Signal and a substantial part of \nthe wrongful conduct alleged herein occurred.  Global Resources is or was incorporated under \nthe laws of Mississippi.  Burnett practices law in, inter alia, Mississippi, and his entities-the \nLaw Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, APC and Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, LLC-have \noffices  in  Mississippi.

At  all  relevant  times,  the  Recruiter  Defendants  acted  as  the  agents  and/or \nrepresentatives of Signal, and were acting within the course and scope of their agency, with the \nfull knowledge, consent, permission, authorization and ratification, either express or implied, of \nSignal in performing the acts alleged herein. \n28.  At all relevant times, Defendants were involved in a common venture and acted in \nconcert to recruit Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, and bring them to the United States to \nwork at Signal, as memorialized by various oral and written communications and agreements, \nand were acting within the course and scope of that common venture and those agreements, with \nthe full knowledge, consent, permission, authorization and ratification, either express or implied, \nof each of the other Defendants in performing the acts alleged herein. \n29.  Defendants  entered  into  a  conspiracy  to  unlawfully  recruit  Indian  workers, \nincluding Plaintiffs, and bring them to the United States under false pretenses to work at Signal, \nand the Defendants' acts alleged herein were carried out in furtherance of that conspiracy. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nDefendants Recruited Plaintiffs to Work (or Signal on False Promises ofa Green Card \nand Charged Them Exorbitant \"Recruiting Fees\" \n30.  In March 2004, the Dewan Defendants, Global Resources (through Pol), and the \nBurnette Defendants concocted a scheme to recruit and transport Indian workers to the United \nStates under false pretenses in exchange for a steep fee.  In an agreement executed in March \n2004 that memorialized this scheme, the Recruiter Defendants specified that they would charge \nthe equivalent of over $10,000 to  applicants for  the  promise of employment and permanent \nresidency in the United States.  While the Recruiter Defendants had every intention to collect \nthese exorbitant fees-equivalent to several years' worth of salary for the average Indian worker \n9 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 10 of 47\ntargeted by the scheme-they had no intention to fulfill the promise of helping the applicants \nobtain permanent residency in the United States. \n31.  In 2004-2005  and in furtherance of this scheme, the Dewan Defendants placed \nadvertisements  in  various  newspapers  across  India  and  the  United  Arab  Emirates  seeking \nwelders, fitters, and other marine-fabrication workers for employment in the United States and \npromising permanent residency there.  One such advertisement promised a \"[j]ob guarantee\" of \n\"2-3 years,\" an attractive salary, and \"[p Jermanent lifetime settlement in the USA for self and \nfamily\" through a \"green card.\"  The advertisements asked those interested to contact Dewan \nConsultants, which had offices in the United Arab Emirates and throughout India.  Plaintiffs saw \nthese  advertisements  and,  enticed  by  the  representations  made  in  them,  contacted  Dewan \nConsultants. \n32.  In or around July 2004, Plaintiff Pravin Kumar Singh, a pipefitter, was  working \nin Dubai, United Arab Emirates (\"UAE\"), when he saw one of these advertisements in the Gulf \nNews newspaper.  In response to the Dewan Defendants' advertisement, Mr. Singh called Dewan \nConsultants and visited its office in Dubai that same month. \n33.  In  or  about  February  2005,  Plaintiff Radhakrishnan  Nair  Mangalathumalayil \nVasukuttan, a pipe and structural fitter, saw one of the Dewan Defendants' advertisements in the \nMalayala Manorama in Kerala, India.  In response to this advertisements, Mr. Vasukuttan called \nDewan Consultants in March of 2005, and subsequently attended meetings and testing sessions \nwith Dewan Consultants. \n34.  In  telephone  conversations  and  meetings,  the  Dewan  Defendants  told  Indian \nworkers lured by these advertisements, including Plaintiffs, that they could be employed in the \nUnited States and obtain a \"green card\" (i.e., permanent residency status in the United States) if \n10 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 11 of 47\nthey paid the equivalent of more than $10,000 in  three installments payable to  the Recruiter \nDefendants.  The Dewan Defendants further represented that the process would take a certain \nnumber of months but repeatedly assured the applicant workers, including Plaintiffs, that they \nwould be employed long term in the United States and would obtain green cards for pennanent \nresidency there as long as the other installments were paid.  Trusting the Dewan Defendants' \nrepresentations, made in coordination with the other Recruiter Defendants and in furtherance of \ntheir scheme, Plaintiffs paid the first installment in 2004-2005, as alleged he low. \n35.  Defendant Dewan Consultants instructed Plaintiff Singh that he could obtain a \ngreen card for work in the United States in about 15-18 months for a cost of 40,500 UAE dirham \n(approximately $11,024 USD) to be paid in three installments, which would be divided among \nthe Recruiter Defendants.  Dewan Consultants assured Mr. Singh that he would get a green card \nat the end of this process as long as this fee was paid. \n36.  In or about August 2004, enticed by the promise of permanent residency and \ngainful employment in the United States, Plaintiff Singh paid Dewan Consultants a registration \nfee of 1,000 dirham (approximately $272 USD) and the first installment totaling approximately \n$3,675 USD.  Dewan Consultants transferred about $1,222 of this amount to Burnett.  Once the \nfirst installment was paid, Dewan Consultants told Mr. Singh that he was on his way to getting a \ngreen card within the following two years. \n37.  As months went by after Plaintiff Singh paid his first installment, he contacted the \nDewan Defendants from time to time to  inquire about the progress of his green card process. \nThe Dewan Defendants repeatedly assured Mr. Singh that the green card application process was \nunderway and that he would hear back from the Dewan Defendants within a few months to ask \nfor the second installment. \n11 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 12 of 47\n38.  In  or  about  March  2005,  Dewan  Consultants  similarly  instructed  Plaintiff \nVasukuttan that he could obtain a green card for work in the United States in about two years for \na cost of 600,000-700,000 Indian rupees (approximately $13,730-$16,020 US D) to be paid in \nthree installments, which would be divided among the Recruiter Defendants.  Dewan Consultants \nassured Mr. Vasukuttan that he would get a green card at the end of this process as long as this \nrecruiting fee was paid. \n39.  On or about March 18, 2005, enticed by the promise of permanent residency and \ngainful  employment  in  the  United  States,  Plaintiff Vasukuttan  paid  Dewan  Consultants  a \nregistration and testing fee of 2,000 rupees (approximately $45  USD) and the first installment \ntotaling approximately $4,180 USD.  Mr. Vasukuttan was instructed to pay this first installment \nto  Dewan Consultants  ($1,260),  Burnett ($1,460), and  Pol  ($1,460)-which he did.  Dewan \nConsultants told Mr. Vasukuttan that this payment would be used to start the green card process \nand that the second installment would become due in about 8 to 12 months.  He was instructed to \nwait until Dewan Consultants got back to him. \n40.  In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of the United States, leaving \na trail of devastation, damaging off-shore oil rigs, ships, and marine platforms, and displacing \nthousands of Gulf-Coast residents.  As a result, Signal faced a shortage of workers to  satisfy \ngrowing demand for its maritime repair and related services. \n41.  In  early  2006,  Michael  Pol,  acting  as  the  President  of  Global  Resources, \napproached Signal with a proposal to address its shortage of workers and the higher demand for \nits services.  In phone conversations and meetings held in the first quarter of 2006, Pol told \nSignal, through its General Manager,  Ronald Schnoor, and Vice President of Productions for \nMississippi Operations, Bill  Bingle, that he could deliver the  fitters  and welders that  Signal \n12 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 13 of 47\nneeded at no cost to  Signal.  Pol informed Signal that he would work with local immigration \nattorney  Burnett  and  India-based  recruiter  Dewan  to  bring  these  workers  from  India.  Pol \nexplained that the  workers themselves would pay for  all  costs  and  fees  associated with the \nrecruitment process, immigration processing, and travel to the United States, and Signal would \nnot reimburse the workers for these recruiting fees.  Signal would pay the workers between $14 \nand  $18  per hour,  depending upon skill  level-a lower amount than the hourly rates  Signal \nwould have to pay domestic contractors.  After its conversations with Pol, Signal decided to join \nthe Recruiter Defendants' scheme of bringing Indian workers to the United States, who would \nnow work for Signal. \n42.  In or about January 2006, Dewan Consultants contacted Plaintiff Vasukuttan and \ninstructed him to pay the second installment to continue the recruiting process for work in the \nUnited States under a green card.  This second installment was for the same amount as the first: \napproximately $4,180 USD payable to Dewan Consultants ($1,260), Burnett ($1,460), and Pol \n($1,460).  Dewan Consultants told Mr. Vasukuttan that it would take about 10-12 months for the \ngreen card  to  be  processed  once  the  second  installment was  paid.  Relying  on  the  Dewan \nDefendants' representations, Mr. Vasukuttan paid this second installment. \n43.  Also in the first half of 2006, Plaintiff Singh called Defendant Sachin Dewan to \ninquire about the status of his green card process.  Dewan reassured Mr. Singh that the process \nwas far advanced and that he would soon be going to the United States, as promised.  Dewan \nadvised Mr. Singh to resign from his job in Dubai and go spend some time with his family in \nIndia, since his departure to the United States was only months away.  After having spent several \nyears working in Dubai, Mr. Singh relied on Dewan's representations and resigned from his job \nthere, returning to India in May 2006. \n13 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 14 of 47\n44.  On April 18, 2006, Signal executed a \"Skilled Worker Recruitment Agreement\" \nwith  Pol's  company,  Defendant  Global  Resources,  authorizing  Global  Resources  to  recruit \nforeign skilled workers for employment at Signal \"under the 'H-2B' temporary program and/or \nthe  'permanent residence' process.\"  Pursuant to  this agreement,  Global Resources would be \nresponsible  for  all  costs associated with recruitment,  transportation, and entry of the  foreign \nworkers into the United States and would deliver the workers \"at no cost to Signal\" to the airport \nof Signal's choice.  The  costs  associated  with  recruitment,  transportation,  and  entry  of the \nforeign workers into the United States would be covered by the  foreign workers themselves, \nthrough the \"recruiting fees\" they had paid and would continue to pay before being shipped to \nthe United States to work for Signal. \n45.  On June 19, 2006, and in connection with the agreement with Global Resources, \nSignal executed a power of attorney with Global Resources' partner and co-venturer, Defendant \nDewan Consultants, appointing it as Signal's \"representative in India to facilitate the recruitment \nof skilled workers to the United States of America\" for employment at Signal.  The power of \nattorney authorized Dewan Consultants to advertise, conduct seminars and trade tests, and sign \nany necessary legal documentation on Signal's behalf.  Thereafter, Dewan Consultants acted on \nSignal's behalf and  in concert  with the  other  Recruiter Defendants,  to  recruit  Plaintiffs  for \nSignal's employ, charging them the last installments of the \"recruiting fees\" under reiterated \npromises of permanent residency in the United States. \n46.  Also in mid-2006, and in connection with the agreement with Global Resources \nand the power of attorney extended to Dewan Consultants, Signal entered into an attorney-client \nrelationship with the Burnett Defendants to advise Signal on immigration issues pertaining to \nSignal's need for and recruitment of Indian workers.  Signal and the Burnett Defendants later \n14 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 15 of 47\nmemorialized their engagement in a written retainer agreement.  Pursuant to  that agreement, \nSignal would not be responsible for any of the Burnett Defendants' legal fees.  Rather, under the \nterms of the agreement, the Burnett Defendants took funds from the \"recruitment fees\" charged \nto the Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, to pay for the legal services provided to Signal. \n47.  By the summer and fall of 2006, Signal wanted the Indian workers recruited-\npursuant to these agreements with the Recruiter Defendants-brought to the United States as \nsoon as possible.  To speed up the process of bringing these workers, including Plaintiffs, to the \nUnited States, the Defendants decided that Signal would sponsor the Indian workers, including \nPlaintiffs, on an H-2B visa, even though they were being promised green cards. \n48.  The  H-2B  guest-worker  program  permits  U.S.  employers  to  import  foreign \nworkers  on  short-term temporary  visas to  meet labor needs when employers attest that they \ncannot find U.S. workers to perform the available jobs.  H-2B visas are non-immigrant visas, are \nonly valid for work with the specific employer listed on the visa, and do not provide portable \nand/or transferable employment authorization for  the visa bearer.  Temporary stay within the \nUnited States is allowed under H-2B visas for a specific and limited period that may be extended \nto no more than three years, after which the worker must leave the United States.  A \"green \ncard,\" by contrast, allows the holder to reside permanently in the United States. \n49.  Unbeknownst  to  Plaintiffs,  Defendants  did  not  take  any  steps  to  apply  for \npermanent residency for  Plaintiffs.  Defendants only helped Plaintiffs obtain temporary H-2B \nvisas that legally prevented Plaintiffs from working for any U.S. employer besides Signal.  Per \nthe Burnett Defendants' advice, Signal represented to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security \nin  mid-2006  that its  need for  the  Indian workers  was  only for  a  10-month period and that \nSignal's need was based on a one-time, peak-load temporary demand.  This representation-\n15 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 16 of 47\nunknown to Plaintiffs-was inconsistent with the Defendants' promises and representations to \nPlaintiffs that they would be sponsored for a green card and long-term employment in the United \nStates. \n50.  To ensure that their deception remained hidden, Defendants instructed the Indian \nworkers to conceal from U.S. consular officials during their forthcoming H-2B visa interviews \nthat, in addition to applying for temporary-worker status, Signal had promised them that it would \nsponsor them  for  green  cards.  As  Michael  Pol,  acting  as  President  of Defendant  Global \nResources,  explained to  Signal's Special Projects Manager,  John Sanders,  in an email dated \nAugust 24, 2006: \nMal[vern Burnett], Sachin [Dewan] or If] needs [sic] to be with \neach and every candidate going into the consulates before their \ninterview [because] [t]hey sometimes say the dumbest things and \nneed to be coached on the proper way to interview.  . .. [T]here are \nsome things that should not be known to the consulate personnel, \nsuch as the fact that we are going to process them for a green card. \nIf one of those guys says he is going to the U.S. for immigration \nand Signal is sponsoring him for permanent residence (green card) \n... he is a goner. \n51.  Despite  Pol's assertion to  Signal that Defendants would \"process\"  the  Indian \nworkers for green cards, Defendants never did so.  Yet, Defendants continued to make Plaintiffs \nand the  other Indian workers  believe that Defendants would process them  for  a green card \nsponsored by Signal. \n52.  In the second half of 2006, the Dewan Defendants, acting as Signal's agent and on \nSignal's behalf and in furtherance of the Defendants' scheme, told Indian workers,  including \nPlaintiffs, that, by agreeing to work for Signal on an H-2B visa, they would go to the United \nStates  sooner without  affecting the  green  card  process.  The  Dewan Defendants,  acting on \nSignal's behalf and in furtherance of the Defendants' scheme, again assured Plaintiffs and the \n16 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 17 of 47\nother Indian workers that Signal would sponsor Plaintiffs and the other Indian workers for work-\nauthorized green cards enabling Plaintiffs and the otl;1er Indian workers to reside permanently \nand legally in the United States with their families. \n53.  On or about September 2, 2006, the Dewan Defendants instructed Plaintiff Singh \nto pay the second installment to continue his recruiting process.  Defendant Sachin Dewan again \nassured Mr. Singh that his green card was only months away.  The second installment demanded \nby  Dewan  totaled  approximately  $5,498  USD,  payable to  Dewan  Consultants  ($3,708)  and \nBurnett ($1,790).  Mr. Singh paid this second installment on or about September 12,2006. \n54.  By this time, Dewan Consultants had received a power of attorney from Signal to \nrecruit Indian workers, as noted above, ~ 45.  In October 2006, Defendant Sachin Dewan, acting \non behalf of Signal and in concert with the other Defendants, contacted Plaintiff Singh.  Dewan \ninformed Mr. Singh that he could go to the United States relatively quickly-within the next 1 Y2 \nmonths-through an H-2B visa that would be valid for a renewable 10-month period.  Dewan \nemphasized that pursuing this visa would not affect Mr.  Singh's green card process.  Dewan \nagain assured Mr. Singh that he would get a green card after that process was complete.  Dewan \nalso threatened Mr. Singh with forfeiture of the more than $8,000 USD he had already paid in \nrecruiting fees if he withdrew from the process and refused to accept the H-2B visa.  Mr. Singh \nagreed to take the steps Dewan instructed him to follow to obtain an H-2B visa for employment \nwith Signal. \n55.  Shortly after this conversation, Dewan Consultants instructed Plaintiff Singh to \nremit 4,800 rupees (approximately $105 USD) to Dewan Consultants as a visa fee.  Mr. Singh \ndid so on or about October 27, 2006, and a few days later, Dewan Consultants called to inform \nhim about his visa interview at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi on December 13,2006. \n17 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 18 of 47\n56.  Similarly, in October 2006, Dewan Consultants, acting on behalf of Signal and in \nconcert with  the  other  Defendants,  contacted  Plaintiff Vasukuttan  to  inform  him  about  the \nopportunity to  work  for  Signal  and  invite  him  to  a  seminar  in  Chennai,  India,  where  this \nopportunity  would be discussed.  By this time,  Dewan Consultants had received a power of \nattorney from Signal to recruit Indian workers, as noted above, ~ 45.  On or about October 26, \n2006,  Mr.  Vasukuttan  attended the  seminar in  Chennai,  where the  Dewan  Defendants,  two \nSignal employees, and  several other Indian workers were present.  Mr.  Vasukuttan took and \npassed a trade test supervised by the two Signal employees.  The Dewan Defendants, acting on \nbehalf of Signal and in concert with the other Defendants, told Mr.  Vasukuttan and the other \nIndian workers in attendance that they would get a short-term visa (i.e., the H-2B visa) lasting no \nmore than one year to work for Signal but that this visa could be extended and would not affect \nthe promised green card for permanent residency in the United States.  The Dewan Defendants \nreassured Mr. Vasukuttan and others that Signal would sponsor them for a green card. \n57.  Within the second half of 2006 and no later than November of that year, Signal \nknew that the Indian workers it was recruiting and bringing to the United States through the \nRecruiter  Defendants,  including  Plaintiffs,  had  been  paying  exorbitant  amounts  of money \ntotaling over $10,000  USD  to  work  for  Signal.  Signal  also  knew that the  Indian  workers, \nincluding Plaintiffs, were paying this money based on the promise by Signal's agents, including \nDewan Consultants, that Signal would sponsor them for a green card and permanent residency in \nthe United States. \n58.  With  this  knowledge,  Signal  continued  to  recruit  and  bring  Indian  workers, \nincluding Plaintiffs, through at least January 2007.  During this time, Signal did nothing to limit \nthe broad recruiting authority it had granted to Dewan Consultants.  During this time, Signal did \n18 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 19 of 47\nnot disclose to Plaintiffs and the other Indian workers that Signal would not sponsor them for \npermanent residency in the United States. \n59.  After  November  2006,  Defendants  duped  Plaintiffs  into  paying  the  final \ninstallment of the \"recruiting fees\" and shipped them off to work for Signal. \n60.  The Dewan Defendants summoned Plaintiff Singh and other Indian workers to a \nmeeting in New Delhi  on December 11, 2006, and Mr.  Singh attended.  At this meeting, the \nDewan Defendants-at the direction of the Burnett Defendants and acting on Signal's behalf-\ninstructed Mr. Singh and others to lie to U.S. consular officials if asked how much they had paid \nin recruiting and immigration processingJees, by answering that they each only paid a total of no \nmore than approximately $790 USD.  The Dewan Defendants also spoke highly of Signal, noting \nthat it would provide good food and lodging to the workers, but concealing the fact that a large \nportion oftheir paycheck would be deducted to pay for these items. \n61.  After Plaintiff Singh's visa interview on December 13,2006, Dewan Consultants, \nacting  on behalf of Signal  and  in  concert with the  other Defendants,  retained Mr.  Singh's \npassport  and  instructed  him  in  early  January  2007  to  pay  the  third  installment  totaling \napproximately $7,118 USD, payable to Dewan Consultants ($4,198), Burnett ($1,460), and Pol \n($1,460).  When Mr. Singh went to Dewan Consultants' Mumbai office to pay its portion of the \nlast installment on or about January 10,2007, Sachin Dewan told him that Signal would pay him \nwell and provide adequate housing,  and again reassured Mr.  Singh that he would get a green \ncard, sponsored by Signal.  Relying on these representations, Mr. Singh paid the third installment \ndemanded by Defendants.  Dewan Consultants thereafter returned Mr. Singh's passport to him \nand gave him a plane ticket to go to the United States on January 24, 2007. \n19 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 20 of 47\n62.  Dewan Consultants similarly instructed PlaintiffVasukuttan to remit 5,000 rupees \n(approximately $110 USD) to Dewan Consultants for a visa interview at the U.S. Consulate.  Mr. \nVasukuttan did so and travelled to Chennai, India, for the visa interview, which was scheduled \nfor  December  23,  2006.  That  interview  had  to  be  rescheduled,  however,  because  Dewan \nConsultants  misspelled  Mr.  Vasukuttan's  name  in  the  paper  work  it  supplied  to  the  U.S. \nConsulate.  Mr. Vasukuttan was required to pay another 5,000 rupees (approximately $110 USD) \nto schedule a new interview for January 4, 2007.  Before the interview, the Dewan Defendants-\nat  the  direction  of the  Burnett  Defendants  and  acting  on  Signal's  behalf-instructed  Mr. \nVasukuttan to  lie to U.S.  consular officials if asked how much he had paid in recruiting and \nimmigration processing fees, by saying that he only paid a total of no more than approximately \n$790 USD. \n63.  After  Plaintiff  Vasukuttan's  vIsa  interview  on  January  4,  2007,  Dewan \nConsultants, acting on behalf of Signal and in concert with the other Defendants, retained his \npassport and instructed him to pay the third installment totaling 340,000 rupees (approximately \n$7,675 USD), which included visa-processing fees and the costs of a plane ticket to the United \nStates.  Mr. Vasukuttan was further instructed to bring the money in cash to Dewan Consultants' \noffices in Mumbai, India.  Dewan Consultants retained Mr. Vasukuttan's passport until he paid \nthe third installment.  In addition, Dewan Consultants indicated that, if Mr. Vasukuttan failed to \npay the third installment, he would receive no refund for the previous installment payments he \nhad made.  On or about January 24, 2007, Mr. Vasukuttan paid the third installment demanded \nby Dewan Consultants, which handed back his passport and gave him a plane ticket to the United \nStates. \n20 \n\n,  Case 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 21 of 47\n64.  In reasonable reliance upon Defendants'  explicit and repeated promises that he \nwould receive a green card in exchange for paying the required recruiting fees,  which would \nenable him and his family to obtain permanent residency in the United States, each Plaintiff \nundertook considerable economic, social,  familial,  and personal sacrifices to obtain the funds \nnecessary to cover the recruiting fees demanded.  Each Plaintiff and his family are of modest \nmeans.  Each Plaintiff was forced to borrow money from lenders at high interest rates (nearly \n10% or more) and from family members to pay Defendants' \"recruiting fees.\" \n65.  Defendants  thus  induced  Plaintiffs  to  enter  into  employment agreements  with \nSignal by falsely  promising to  help Plaintiffs obtain green cards.  Defendants actually never \nintended and took no steps to obtain green cards for Plaintiffs. \n66.  Plaintiffs would not have paid the exorbitant fees that the Recruiter Defendants \ncharged them had they known that Defendants' promises and representations were false, and that \nDefendants had failed to disclose material facts concerning the nature and terms and conditions \nofthe immigration and work opportunities offered. \n67.  After each Plaintiff paid his  last installment, he was shipped off to  the United \nStates to work for Signal in late January 2007.  On January 24, 2007, Plaintiff Singh boarded a \nflight to the United States, where Signal personnel awaited to transport him to one of its camps. \nPlaintiff Vasukuttan's flight to the United States was scheduled soon after his meeting at Dewan \nConsultants'  office  in  Mumbai  to  pay the  third  installment.  He  took  a  taxi  to  the  airport \nimmediately after that meeting.  On or about January 25, 2007, he boarded a flight to the United \nStates, where Signal personnel awaited to transport him to one of its camps. \n21 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 22 of 47\nPlaintiffs Were Taken to Signal's Prison-Like \"Reservations, \" Subjected to Discriminatory and \nDegrading Conditions, and Forced to Acquiesce Under Threat o(Dismissal and Deportation \n68.  Upon arrival in the United States in late January 2007, Plaintiffs were received at \nthe airport in Houston, Texas, by Signal representatives, who escorted them and other Indian \nworkers to buses that transported them to fenced camp grounds Signal had constructed for the \npurpose of housing them and the other Indian workers.  After arriving in Houston on or about \nJanuary 24, 2007, Plaintiff Singh was driven overnight-without being offered food or water-to \nSignal's  camp  in Pascagoula,  Mississippi.  Similarly,  after  arriving  in  Houston on or about \nJanuary 25, 2007, PlaintiffVasukuttan was taken to Signal's camp in Orange, Texas.  In addition \nto  Plaintiffs,  Signal  shipped  approximately  300  Indian  workers  to  its  camp  in  Pascagoula, \nMississippi, and over 200 such workers to its camp in Orange, Texas. \n69.  Signal required the Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, to live in these camps. \nSignal employees and management called the camps \"the Reservation(s).\"  They also discussed \namong themselves, including in emails, that housing the Indian workers in a secluded camp was \npreferable, as it would keep the Indians segregated from the rest ofthe community. \n70.  Signal's camps  in Pascagoula, Mississippi,  and  Orange,  Texas,  were  isolated, \novercrowded, unsanitary, and unsuitable for human habitation.  They were miles removed from \nshopping areas, places of worship, and residential communities. \nOvercrowded Bunkhouses \n71.  Upon arrival at Defendant Signal's facilities in Pascagoula and Orange, Plaintiffs \ndiscovered that they were expected to live in trailer-like bunkhouses.  Signal crammed no less \nthan 20 men  in  each bunkhouse,  with  hunk-beds  so  tightly  packed that  it  was  difficult for \nPlaintiffs to move between them. \n22 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 23 of 47\n72.  The Signal labor camp bunkhouses had insufficient toilet and showering facilities \nfor the 20 or more men housed in them.  Lines for the bathroom were consistently very long, \nforcing  workers  to  wait a long time to use the  bathroom or to  shower in outhouses,  where \navailable.  Hot water was a luxury reserved to the lucky few who were able to use the shower \nfirst, leaving the rest to shower with only cold water. \n73.  Privacy  was  non-existent  in  the  bunkhouses,  and  Plaintiffs  often  experienced \nextreme difficulty sleeping due to the constant noise resulting from the close quarters and the \ncomings  and  goings  of workers  who  worked  on  different  shifts.  Plaintiff Vasukuttan,  for \nexample, was assigned to the night shift and could barely sleep during the day because of the \nnoise.  He sometimes was forced to work long hours at night only to be able to sleep 3 or 4 hours \nduring the day due to the poor and noisy conditions in the bunkhouse assigned to him. \n74.  Plaintiff Vasukuttan  was  assigned  a  cramped  bunkhouse  in  Signal's camp  In \nOrange, Texas, that had 10 bunk-beds for 20 men.  His sleeping quarters, shared with 19 other \nIndian workers, had only one bathroom for all of them.  The bunkhouse was so congested that he \nhad little room to move.  The air conditioning and heating system continuously broke down, \nforcing Mr. Vasukuttan and his bunkhouse-mates to suffer through heat and cold in their tightly \nshared housing quarters. \n75.  Plaintiff  Singh  was  assigned  a  cramped  bunkhouse  in  Signal's  camp  in \nPascagoula, Mississippi.  His assigned bunkhouse had 11 bunk-beds for 22 men.  The bunkhouse \nhad only two bathrooms,  which were inadequate for all the men housed therein.  Mr.  Singh \nfound it difficult to move, rest, clean up, or even breath in these housing facilities. \n76.  These conditions fell far short of basic requirements of habitability,  For example, \nthe federal government's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") guidelines \n23 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 24 of 47\nstate that bunkhouses of similar purpose should have a minimum of 50 square feet of floor space \nper habitant.  Signal's bunkhouses offered less than  18  square feet  of floor  space per worker. \nLikewise, OSHA guidelines require bunk beds to be at least 48  inches apart from other beds. \nSignal's bunk-beds were so tightly packed together that workers were essentially sleeping next to \neach other. \n77.  In  internal  communications,  Signal  personnel  acknowledged  that  there  was \n\"overcrowding\" at its camps and that \"more toilet/sink capacity\" was needed.  Yet, as explained \nfurther below, Signal forced Plaintiffs and the other Indian workers to endure the conditions it \nimposed on them at its camps. \nMalnutrition and Disease \n78.  The  food  provided  by  Signal  was  so  bad  and  prepared  in  such  unsanitary \nconditions  that  it  triggered  stomachaches  for  Plaintiff  Singh  and  diarrhea  for  Plaintiff \nVasukuttan.  Poor, left-over food was often served to the workers, and the food would frequently \nspoil. \n79.  Signal  offered  meals  exclusively in  a mess  hall,  which was only open  during \nlimited  hours.  Workers  who  showed  up  a  few  minutes  late  for  a  meal  were  denied  food \naltogether. \n80.  Signal offered food items that some Indian workers could not eat for religious or \nother reasons, such as pork or beef.  Plaintiff Singh was one of these workers.  In days when \nthose items were offered, Indian workers, including Plaintiff Singh, ate nothing or very little. \n81.  In an email to  other Signal personnel, Signal Senior Vice-President &  General \nManager Ron Schnoor acknowledged the \"bad, stale, molded, and otherwise poor quality food.\" \n24 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 25 of 47\n82.  As a result of the  facts outlined above, Plaintiffs were malnourished while they \nlived at Signal's camps. \n83.  Workers living in Signal's camps, including Plaintiffs, suffered from disease and \nhealth issues as a result of their living conditions and the food served to them.  As explained by \nSignal's manager of the Pascagoula camp: \nOur Indians have been dropping with sickness like flies .... [They1   \nare getting worried and believe there are unhealthful conditions in \nthe camp.  It is true.  The reason is because the plumbing was so \nshoddily done by GE's subcontractors, and water has leaked \neverywhere and stagnated as a result, which serves as a bacterial \nbreeding ground. \nSignal's Prison-Like Surveillance and Policies \n84.  Signal's camps were enclosed by fences and accessible only by a single guarded \nentrance.  The labor camp gates were constantly monitored by security guards retained by Signal. \n85.  Signal's security guards monitored Plaintif£~' comings and goings by recording \nwhen Plaintiffs entered and exited the camps.  Their movements into and out of the camp were \nlogged.  Signal's security guards also searched Plaintiffs' packages and bags when they entered \nthe camps.  The guards also searched Plaintiffs' persons. \n86.  Signal  prohibited Plaintiffs  from  drinking  alcohol  at  the  camps.  It designed \npenalties for those who violated this rule, including suspension from work without pay.  The \nprohibition of alcohol was modeled after Signal's policies for conduct in the workplace despite \nthe fact that Plaintiffs were living, not working, in Signal's camps. \n87.  To enforce its camp-specific rules, Defendant Signal's personnel and/or security \nguards conducted surprise searches of the dormitory areas of the bunkhouses, including searches \nof workers' personal belongings.  In addition, Plaintiffs were not allowed to bring visitors into \nthe camp. \n25 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 26 of 47\n88.  The camps were so isolated, with nothing around them, that Plaintiffs and other \nIndian workers had to rely on Signal-provided transportation to and from work and populated \nareas.  Aside from taking them to  work,  Signal would only take  Plaintiffs and other Indian \nworkers to buy groceries or the bank.  Plaintiffs and other Indian workers otherwise stayed in the \ncamp because there was nowhere else for them to go near the camp grounds, and they lacked the \nmeans to go anywhere else. \n89.  Signal did not bar its non-Indian workers from having visitors or drinking alcohol \nin their homes.  Nor did Signal contine its non-Indian workers to crowded bunkhouses or subject \nthem to invasive searches of their homes or belongings and near-constant surveillance. \nSignal Charged Each PlaintiffA  pproximately $1,050 USD Each Month to Live in These \nConditions \n90.  Signal  automatically deducted approximately $35  per day  ($245  per week,  or \napproximately  $1,050  per month)  from  Plaintiffs'  and  other  Indian workers'  paychecks  for \nhousing and food at the camps.  Plaintiffs did not understand that this amount would be deducted \nfrom their salary for housing and meals until they received their first paychecks.  Plaintiffs never \nknowingly authorized these deductions.  After all  of these  deductions,  Plaintiffs netted only \nenough to survive and to provide minimal support to their families, yet not enough to pay the \nsubstantial debts they incurred in recruiting fees to come work for Signal and be forced to live in \nits camps. \n91.  Signal imposed this deduction on Plaintiffs and the other Indian workers to recoup \nthe cost of constructing and operating the camps in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and Orange, Texas. \nBefore Signal decided to set the deduction at $35  per day, Signal's Senior Vice President and \nGeneral Manager Ronald Schnoor initially recommended that Signal charge the workers $53.50 \nper day.  Schnoor reached that figure by calculating the amount it would take to amortize over \n26 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 27 of 47\njust ten months the entire cost Signal incurred building the camps.  Schnoor dismissed the impact \nof this monthly fee by asserting that the Plaintiffs and their fellow workers would all be \"happy \ncampers.\"  This assessment was based on the biased belief that Signal's living arrangements and \nwages were an improvement over Plaintiffs' and their Indian co-workers' previous conditions. \n92.  When Indian workers complained about the poor conditions at the  camps and \nasked to live elsewhere, Signal told them that, if they tried to live outside the camps, it would \nstill deduct the room-and-board fees of approximately $35 per day from their paycheck.  As a \nresult, Plaintiffs--still burdened by the debt incurred to pay the Recruiter Defendants' fees, of \nwhich Signal was well aware---were left with no choice but to continue living in Signal's camps. \nSignal thus compelled Plaintiffs to remain in the camps it assigned to them. \n93.  On top of this, Signal charged Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, for the tools \nthey had to use at work and the pillows they were given to sleep on.  Signal deducted about $400 \nfrom  Plaintiff Singh's paychecks,  for  example,  to  recover the  costs  it  spent on these  items. \nSignal similarly deducted about $180 from PlaintiffVasukuttan's paycheck to charge him for the \nvery tools he was to use on the job for Signal. \n94.  By exploiting Plaintiffs' precarious financial position, heavy debt load, uncertain \nimmigration  situation,  and  fear  of job  loss,  Signal  assured  that  Plaintiffs  and  their  Indian \ncoworkers would have no choice but to continue working at the company and living at the camps \nit had constructed for them, at least until Signal made enough money from the Indian workers \nthemselves to recover the costs of building and operating the camps. \nPlaintiffs Endured Discrimination by Signal Due to Their Race. Ethnicity, Religion, and \nAlienage \n95.  Signal discriminated against Plaintiffs and their Indian co-workers.  Workers of \nnon-Indian race, ethnicity, or alienage were not required to live in and pay for housing and food \n27 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 28 of 47\nIII  Signal's  camps.  Only  the  Indians  brought  to  the  United  States  through  the  Recruiter \nDefendants were housed there and required to  pay so  that Signal could recoup what it spent \nbuilding the camps.  Accordingly, no  other Signal employee other than the Plaintiffs and the \nother Indians brought in 2006-2007 by the Recruiter Defendants had to endure the poor living \nconditions, bad food, and prison-like environment of the camps in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and \nOrange, Texas. \n96.  Signal's discriminatory treatment of Plaintiffs and their Indian co-workers was \nnot  limited to  the  room-and-board  policies  it  imposed on them.  Signal employees taunted, \nabused, and verbally attacked the Indian workers.  On several occasions, for example, Signal \nemployees in Mississippi insulted Plaintiff Singh by uttering slurs, including some that they had \nlearned in Hindi. \n97.  In an April 5, 2007, email to  Signal employees Bill Bingle and Tracey Binion, \nSignal employee Darrell Snyder stated his opinion that it was a \"misguided notion that some of \nthese Indians can be reasoned with,\" and discussed his plan to engage in a \"rat hunt\" in the \nPascagoula camp to determine who was causing \"dissension\" among the workers. \n98.  Defendant Signal subjected Plaintiffs and other Indian workers to skills testing \nand re-testing, on-the-job discipline, layoffs, periods without work, unfavorable job assignments, \nevaluation processes,  andlor  other adverse  employment actions or threats  of such actions to \nwhich,  upon information and  belief,  non-Indian and  U.S.  citizen workers were  not  similarly \nsubjected.  Indian workers, including Plaintiff Vasukuttan, were required to perform demeaning \njanitorial work that non-Indian workers were not required to perform. \n99.  Signal's on-the-job policies were strictly enforced against the Indian workers and \nPlaintiffs,  while  the  same  policies  were  not  applied  to  or  not  enforced  against  non-Indian \n28 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 29 of 47\nworkers.  Signal, for instance, required Indian workers to shave for work and strictly enforced \nthis rule against them.  Failure to meet this policy would lead to suspension from work without \npay  for  days.  Signal  required  even  Indian  workers  who  were  Sikh  and  wore  beards  in \naccordance with  their  Sikh religious beliefs to  shave.  Meanwhile, non-Indian workers were \nallowed to go to work with a beard. \n100.  Signal  personnel  and  management  threatened  that,  if  the  Indian  workers, \nincluding Plaintiffs, did not work according to Signal's specifications, they would be fired andlor \ndeported to India.  In the isolated and guarded atmosphere of the labor camps and grappling with \nthe crushing debts they had incurred to come to the United States, Plaintiffs reasonably felt that \nSignal's statements were threatening and felt forced to continue working for Signal despite the \ninhuman working and living conditions to which they were subjected. \nlOl.  Plaintiffs'  continuing dependence upon Defendant Signal for their present and \nfuture immigration status and their continuing high levels of indebtedness, along with the prison-\nlike  living  conditions  that  they  had  been  exposed  to  at  Signal's  so-called  \"Reservations,\" \nreasonably caused Plaintiffs to fear serious harm andlor abuse of the legal process ifthey were to \nleave Signal's employ. \nDefendants Continued to Deceive Plaintiffs About the Prospects \nofO  btaining a Signal-Sponsored Green Card \n102.  On  several  occasions  in  the  first  months  of 2007,  Signal  personnel  met  with \nworkers who asked about the promise that had been made to them about receiving green cards to \nlive and  work permanently in the United  States.  By this time,  Signal  was  well  aware that \nPlaintiffs and other Indian workers had paid large amounts of money to its Recruiter-Defendant \nagents to come to work for Signal in reliance on the promise that they would be sponsored for a \ngreen card. \n29 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 30 of 47\n103.  Rather than tell Plaintiffs and the other Indian workers honestly that Signal and its \nagents had not applied for permanent residency  on their behalf and would not do so,  Signal \ncontinued to deceive them into believing that Signal or its agents would apply for and help them \nobtain permanent residency status.  In meetings held with the workers in the Pascagoula camp in \nthe first quarter of 2007, for instance, Signal representatives told Plaintiff Singh and other Indian \nworkers that Signal would seek extensions of their H-2B visas and process their green cards. \n104.  Throughout this period, Signal employees communicated and consulted with each \nother and with the Dewan and Burnett Defendants concerning what to tell workers, including \nPlaintiffs, about the status of their visas and green card applications.  Defendants maintained the \nillusion that Plaintiffs would receive green cards, when in reality Defendants were doing nothing \nto fulfill their promise. \nSignal Attempts to Send Several Workers Back to India \nto Quell Rising Discontent at the Camps and Intimidate Plaintiffs into Acquiescence \n105.  By late February and early March 2007, some Indian workers began to consider \nways of convincing Signal to improve the conditions they were forced to live and work under, \nand sought advice from locals outside the camp, including attorneys.  When Signalleamed about \nthis, it fueled-with the assistance of the Dewan and Burnett Defendants-an environment of \nfear and intimidation among the workers to quell dissent and to force acquiescence. \n106.  Defendants Signal and Dewan started to pressure at least one of these workers, \nSabulal Vijayan, who was placed in Signal's camp in Pascagoula, Mississippi.  After Signal \nlearned of Mr.  Vijayan's activities in pursuit of better conditions for  the  Indian workers,  it \nnotified one of its Recruiter-Defendant agents, Dewan, who proceeded to  call Mr.  Vijayan's \nfamily in India to warn that Mr. Vijayan should stop making trouble at Signal.  When news of \n30 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 31 of 47\nthis and  similar calls  spread through the  camps, Indian workers became more  fearful of the \nconsequences of complaining about the living and working conditions at Signal. \n107.  Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, had been warned by Signal that, if they kept \nasking  for  better  living  and  working conditions,  they  would risk termination or suspension \nwithout pay.  Signal now made the threat of deportation back to India-Plaintiffs' greatest fear, \ngiven all they had gone through to obtain the green card Defendants promised-clear. \n108.  On March 9, 2007, Signal locked the gate to the Pascagoula camp, thus blocking \nthe only exit.  By then, Signal had decided to terminate certain Indian workers who had tried to \norganize other workers and find ways to  improve their situation.  Signal wanted to make \"an \nexample\" of these workers to the other Indian workers.  Early in the morning of that day, Signal \nemployee Darrell Snyder and several Signal security guards swept through the camp in search of \nthose employees, found most of them, and locked them up in a room.  Signal then told them that \nthey were fired and would be deported to India.  Distraught at what this meant for him and his \nfamily, one of these workers slashed his wrists in an attempt to commit suicide. \n109.  Plaintiff Singh was awakened by the commotion that this incident stirred in the \nPascagoula camp.  When he exited his bunkhouse to see what was going on, Mr. Singh saw that \none of his coworkers had cut his wrists and had blood flowing down his hands.  Signal did \nnothing to help him, and fellow coworkers had to arrange for him to be taken to a hospital.  Mr. \nSingh learned that this coworker and other Indian workers had been locked up in a room and told \nthat they would be deported to India after they tried to organize to improve living conditions at \nthe camp.  The other workers that Signal had rounded up were kept in the room for hours.  After \napproximately eight hours under Signal's custody, the workers were escorted out of the camp by \nSignal and handed over to a local charity. \n31 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 32 of 47\n110.  PlaintiffVasukuttan and the other Indian workers who lived in Signal's camp in \nOrange,  Texas,  soon  heard about these  events and the  attempted suicide of one  of their co-\nworkers in Mississippi after learning that Signal would deport this co-worker back to India. \nIll.  The events of March 9, 2007, generated great fear in each of the Plaintiffs and \nother Indian workers at Signal's camps.  Plaintiffs were scared of what Signal would do to them \nif they raised concerns about conditions at the camp.  Plaintiffs believed, based on Signal's \nconduct, that protesting their plight would lead to dismissal and deportation back to India. \n112.  By its conduct on March 9, 2007, Signal intentionally created a climate of fear \nand  intimidation in order to  overawe the  Plaintiffs  and  their coworkers  into  dropping their \ncomplaints about the camp and their treatment by Signal.  As alleged below, ~~ 114-115, the \nDewan  and  Burnett  Defendants  actively  fostered  this  climate  of fear  and  intimidation  by \nconceding Signal's requests to  speak with the workers in the Pascagoula and Orange camps. \nThese  Defendants  encouraged the  Indian  workers,  including  Plaintiffs,  to  acquiesce to  their \nliving conditions and continue doing their jobs without causing trouble. \nSignal, Assisted by Burnett and Dewan, Used Fraud and Coercion to \nKeep Plaintiffs Living at the Camps and Working for Signal at Its Will \n113.  Following  the  March  9,  2007,  incident,  Signal  and  the  Dewan  and  Burnett \nDefendants  used  additional  fraudulent  and  coercive  tactics  to  keep  the  workers,  including \nPlaintiffs, under Signal's control. \n114.  In  or  about  mid-March  2007,  Burnett  and  Dewan  traveled  to  the  camps  in \nPascagoula, Mississippi, and Orange, Texas, to again reassure workers that they would receive \ngreen cards and/or warn them that they should not cause any trouble fot Signal, lest they face \ntermination and deportation back to India.  Dewan participated in at least one such meeting with \nthe Indian workers at the Pascagoula camp.  Burnett participated in at least one such meeting \n32 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 33 of 47\nwith  the  Indian  workers  at the  Texas  camp  to  warn  them  not  to  do  what the  workers  m \nMississippi had done. \n1 J 5.  That same month, Signal Senior Vice President Ron Schnoor, joined by Burnett \nand others, addressed the entire Pascagoula camp about what had happened on March 9th.  He \nassured  the  men  that  Signal  would  continue  to  employ  them  for  the  \"long  term\"  if they \nacquiesced to their situation and continued to work.  This assurance was false, however, given \nthat Signal still had not decided whether it would extend any of the workers beyond the initial \nten-month visa period, and given that Signal thought it likely at the time that visa extensions \nwould not be sought for certain workers.  Schnoor also threatened the workers, telling them that \nif anyone of them filed a lawsuit against Signal, Signal would refuse to extend any of the H-2B \nvisas for any of the workers, and would therefore send all of them back to India.  Signal knew \nfull well that this threat would coerce the workers, including Plaintiffs, into staying at the camps, \nlest they return to India in crushing debt. \nAfter Months ofE  xploitation, intimidation, and Abuse, \nSignal Terminates Plaintiffs Without Reason \n116.  On May 28, 2007, Plaintiff Vasukuttan reported to work as usual, but the Signal \nsupervisor in charge of his night shift told him and two of his co-workers that they had been \nterminated.  The Signal employee gave Mr. Vasukuttan no valid reason for his sudden dismissal. \nHe  gave  Mr.  Vasukuttan three days  to  leave  Signal's camp.  After only about four  months \nworking  for  Signal,  having  been  brought  by  Defendants  halfway  around  the  world  on  the \npromise of a green card and long-term employment in the United States, having been charged \nover $16,000 in recruiting fees,  and having endured Signal's abuse and discrimination in the \nOrange, Texas, camp, Mr. Vasukuttan was summarily dismissed. \n33 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 34 of 47\n117.  On July 24, 2007, Plaintiff Singh tried to punch his work time card and found that \nit did not work.  When he inquired why it did not work, a Signal supervisor told him that he had \nbeen terminated and had to return to India.  Signal refused to explain why Mr. Singh was being \ndismissed.  He was given two days to leave Signal's camp.  Mr. Singh's H-2B visa was set to \nexpire in only a few days,  on  July 31, 2007.  After less than six months working for Signal, \nhaving been brought by Defendants halfway around the world on the promise of a green card and \nlong-term employment, having been charged over $16,000 in recruiting fees, and having endured \nSignal's abuse  and discrimination at the Pascagoula, Mississippi, camp, Mr.  Singh was  also \nsummarily dismissed. \n118.  After  their  dismissal  from  Signal,  each  Plaintiff separately  paid  the  Burnett \nDefendants a visit to seek their help in obtaining the permanent residency status that Plaintiffs \nhad paid the Recruiter Defendants to obtain.  Burnett charged Plaintiffs Singh and Vasukuttan \n$100 each for this visit.  Burnett suggested to Plaintiffs that he would follow up and help them, \nbut he thereafter did not help them obtain what had been promised.  Although Burnett had years \nearlier agreed to assist in filing green card applications on behalf of Plaintiffs in exchange for the \nthousands of dollars they paid him, he never did so. \n119.  Despite  Defendants'  promises  to  Plaintiffs  of a  green  card  and  long-term \nemployment in the United States, Defendants never applied for Plaintiffs to receive a green card \nand never sponsored Plaintiffs for a green card.  The Recruiter Defendants, acting in concert with \neach other and on behalf of Signal, guaranteed each Plaintiff a green card in exchange for over \n$16,000 USD, but a green card application was not even filed for Plaintiffs even though they \nfully paid these recruiting fees. \n34 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 35 of 47\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nTRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2003 \nViolation ofthe Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (\"TVPRA\") of 2003, \n18 U.S.c. §§ 1589, 1590, 1592, 1594, 1595 \nAll Defendants \n120.  Each Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n121.  Each  Plaintiff brings  this  claim  against  all  Defendants  pursuant  to  the  civil \nremedies provision of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of2003, 18 U.S.C. \n§ 1595. \n122.  Plaintiffs are victims of violations of the following sections of Title 18, Chapter \n77  of the  United  States  Code:  18  U.S.C.  §§  1589  (forced  labor),  1590  (trafficking),  1592 \n(unlawful conduct with respect to documents in furtherance of, inter alia, trafficking and forced \nlabor), 1594 (attempt and conspiracy), and 1595 (civil remedies). \n123.  Defendants subjected, attempted to subject, and conspired to subject Plaintiffs to \nforced labor in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1589, 1594. \n124.  Defendants  knowingly  threatened  and/or  conspired to  threaten  Plaintiffs  with \nserious harm in order to obtain the labor and services of Plaintiffs in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ \n1589(a)(2),1594. \n125.  In violation of 18  U.S.c.  §§  I 589(a)(4),  1594, Defendants knowingly obtained \nand/or conspired to obtain the labor and services of Plaintiffs using a scheme, plan, or pattern \nthat, in the totality of the circumstances, was intended to cause and did, in fact, cause Plaintiffs to \nbelieve that they would suffer serious harm  if they were to  leave the  employ of Defendant \nSignal. \n35 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 36 of 47\n126.  Defendants, individually or through their agents or co-conspirators, threatened to \nretaliate against Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs' co-workers for attempts to exercise their legal rights, \nthreatened Plaintiffs with deportation, and deceived Plaintiffs about their immigration status in a \nmanner that constitutes an abuse oflaw or the legal process under 18 U.S.c. § 1589(a)(3). \n127.  Defendants knowingly confiscated and possessed and/or conspired to confiscate \nand/or possess Plaintiffs' passports and visa papers in the course of a violation of and/or with the \nintent to violate 18U.S.C. §§ 1589 and 1594. \n128.  Defendants knowingly benefitted, financially and by receiving value, from their \nparticipation in the venture that, as has been alleged herein, engaged in acts in violation of 18 \nU.S.C. §§  1592, 1595(a).  Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that the venture \nhad engaged in such violation. \n129.  Defendants  are  the  perpetrators  of the  acts  set  forth  above  and  knowingly \nbenefi ted financially from participating in a venture that they knew or should have known was \nengaged in the acts set forth above. \n130.  In violation of 18  U.S.C.  § 1594(b), Defendants conspired with each other to \nviolate 18 U.S.C. §§ 1589, 1590, and/or 1592. \n131.  Each of the acts in violation of 18 U.S.c. §§  1589, 1590, 1592, 1594, and 1595, \nset forth above was carried out in furtherance of Defendants' conspiracy to unlawfully recruit \nIndian workers, including Plaintiffs, and bring them to the United States under false pretenses to \nwork at Signal. \n132.  Defendants aided and abetted each other in carrying out the acts in violation of 18 \nU.S.c. §§ 1589, 1590, 1592, 1594, and 1595, set forth above. \n36 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 37 of 47\n133.  As set forth more fully above, Defendants' scheme and conspiracy to unlawfully \nrecruit Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, and  bring them to the United  States under false \npretenses to work at Signal was designed to convince each Plaintiff that he would suffer serious \nharm if he were to leave the employ of Signal or Signal's required housing  facilities.  Acts \ncarried out by Defendants, individually or through their agents, in furtherance of this conspiracy \ninclude, inter alia, bringing each Plaintiff to the United States under a false promise and hope for \na  green card  that  was  not  even  going  to  be  sought  on  his  behalf,  charging  each  Plaintiff \nexorbitant and  non-refundable recruiting fees,  holding  each Plaintiffs'  passports without his \nconsent until such fees were fully paid, instructing each Plaintiff to lie to U.S. consular officials \nin order to  secure a temporary visa for  him,  isolating each Plaintiff in a gated camp under \ninhuman conditions, limiting his outside contacts, threatening deportation, withholding material \ninformation about his immigration status,  maintaining each Plaintiff in debt,  causing serious \nharm to Plaintiffs' Indian co-workers, and discriminating against each Plaintiff in violation of 42 \nU.S.C. § 1981. \n134.  At  all  relevant  times,  the  Recruiter  Defendants  acted  as  Signal's  agents  in \ncarrying out the acts in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§  1589, 1590, 1592, 1594, and 1595, set forth \nabove.  As set forth more fully above, Signal engaged each of the Recruiter Defendants to act on \nits behalf in the recruitment, visa processing, and transportation of Plaintiffs and other Indian \nworkers to the United States to work for Signal. \n135.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' acts in violation of the TVPRA, \neach Plaintiff has been injured and is entitled to recover compensatory and punitive damages in \nan amount to be proven at trial, including attorneys' fees. \n37 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 38 of 47\nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nVIOLATIONS OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1866 \n42 U.S.C. § 1981 \nDefendant Signal \n136.  Each Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n137.  Each Plaintiff asserts this  claim pursuant to  42  U.S.c.  §  1981  for declaratory \nrelief and damages against Defendant Signal. \n138.  The actions of Defendant Signal, as set forth herein, violated Plaintiffs' rights to \nreceive full and equal benefit of all laws as guaranteed by 42 U.S.c. § 1981, including Plaintiffs' \nrights to enjoy and benefit from a non-discriminatory employment relationship with Signal. \n139.  Specifically, Signal subjected Plaintiffs to  discriminatory and mandatory room-\nand-board policies at Signal's camps in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and Orange, Texas. \n140.  Signal did not subject its non-Indian and U.S. citizen employees to the same or \nsimilar room-and-board policies.  Signal referred to the camps where it housed Plaintiffs and the \nother Indian workers as \"the Reservation(s).\" \n141.  As set forth in the preceding paragraphs, Signal also imposed discriminatory job-\nrelated requirements and adverse terms and conditions of employment to which non-Indian and \nU.S. citizen employees were not similarly subject. \n142.  As set forth in the preceding paragraphs, through the actions and statements of its \npersonnel referring to or directed at Plaintiffs and other Indian workers, Signal maintained an \nobjectively  hostile  and  abusive  work  environment  on  account  of Plaintiffs'  race,  ethnicity, \nnational origin, and/or alienage. \n38 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 39 of 47\n143.  As set forth in the preceding paragraphs, Signal's discriminatory and offensive \ntreatment of Plaintiffs  was  sufficiently  severe that it created  a  hostile  work environment in \nviolation of 42 U.S.c. § 1981. \n144.  Plaintiffs reasonably perceived their work environment to be hostile, abusive, and \ndiscriminatory on the basis of their race, national origin, and/or alienage. \n145.  Signal's hostile, abusive, and discriminatory treatment of Plaintiffs and other class \nmembers was unwelcome. \n146.'  Signal knowingly, willfully, maliciously, intentionally, and without justification \nacted to deprive Plaintiffs of their rights. \n147.  As a direct and proximate result of Signal's unlawful acts, each Plaintiff has been \ninjured and is entitled recover compensatory and punitive damages in an amount to be proven at \ntrial, including attorneys' fees. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFRAUD / FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENT A TION \nAll Defendants \n148.  Each Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs. \n149.  Each Plaintiff brings this claim against all Defendants. \n150.  As set forth  in the preceding paragraphs, Defendants, individually and through \ntheir agents,  employees,  representatives,  and/or co-conspirators,  knowingly  and/or recklessly \nmade materially false and untrue statements and representations to Plaintiffs regarding the nature \nand  terms  and  conditions  of  applications  and  opportunities  for  immigration  status  and \nemployment in the United States. \n39 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 40 of 47\n151.  Defendants and/or their respective agents, employees, representatives, and/or co-\nconspirators made these representations knowing that they were false or recklessly ignoring their \ntruth,  intending  that  the  representations  would  induce  Plaintiffs  to  pay  the  exorbitant  fees \nrequested by the Recruiter Defendants, leave their homes in India and, in the case of Plaintiff \nSingh, a job in Dubai, and travel to the United States at no cost to Signal to work for the Signal. \n152.  Specifically, as alleged more fully above, Defendants engaged in the following \nacts, among others: \n•  In  March 2004,  the  Recruiter  Defendants  memorialized  a  scheme and  agreement \nwhereby they would charge the equivalent of over $ I 0,000 to Indian workers for the \npromise of employment and permanent residence in the United States.  The Recruiter \nDefendants  intended to  collect these  exorbitant fees--equivalent to  several  years' \nworth of salary for the average Indian worker targeted by the scheme-but did not \nintend to fulfill the promise of helping the applicants obtain permanent residency in \nthe United States. \n•  Starting in 2004 and in furtherance of this scheme, the Dewan Defendants advertised \na \"Olob guarantee\" of \"2-3 years\" and \"permanent lifetime settlement in the U.S.A. \nfor self and family.\"  Plaintiffs saw these advertisements and contacted the Dewan \nDefendants relying on  the  representations  made  therein.  The  Dewan Defendants \nrepresented  to  Plaintiffs  at  various  times  in  2004-2007  that  they  would  obtain \npermanent residency and steady, long-term, and ongoing work opportunities in the \nUnited States if they paid thousands of dollars to the Recruiter Defendants.  These \nrepresentations  were  false,  as  the  Recruiter  Defendants  did  not intend to process \npermanent residency applications for Plaintiffs and, in fact, never did so. \n40 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 41 of 47\n•  In 2006,  Signal joined the Recruiter Defendants'  recruiting scheme.  On June  19, \n2006, for instance, Signal granted a broad power of attorney to Dewan Consultants, \nauthorizing it to act on Signal's behalf as Signal's recruiting agent abroad to bring \nIndian workers to the United States at no cost to Signal to work for Signal.  The costs \nof recruiting, migration processing, and transporting these workers for Signal would \nbe covered by the workers themselves through the Recruiter Defendants' recruiting \nfees.  Signal knew that Plaintiffs and other Indian workers were charged these fees \nand were promised green cards to go work for Signal, yet recruited them through its \nRecruiter-Defendant agents. \n•  Acting  as  Signal's agents,  the  Dewan Defendants represented to  Plaintiffs in  the \nsecond half of 2006 and in January 2007 that they would obtain permanent residency \nand long-term employment in the United States working for Signal if they completed \npayment of thousands of dollars to the Recruiter Defendants.  The Dewan Defendants \nalso represented to Plaintiffs that Signal would provide adequate housing and food \nwhile it employed them.  These representations were false. \n•  In early 2007, after Plaintiffs had been shipped to the United States and placed in \nSignal's camps for Indian workers in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and Orange, Texas, \nSignal-with the  assistance  of the  Burnett and  Dewan  Defendants-continued to \ndeceive Plaintiffs and the other Indian workers into believing that Signal or its agents \nwould  apply  for  and  help  them  obtain  permanent  residency  status.  These \nrepresentations  were  false  and  were  made  to  ensure  that  the  Indian  workers \nacquiesced to the discriminatory conditions and policies Signal imposed on them. \n41 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 42 of 47\n153.  The  representations  made by Defendants,  individually or through their agents, \nemployees,  representatives,  and  co-conspirators,  that  Plaintiffs  would  obtain  permanent \nresidency  in  the  United  States  and  would  have  steady,  long-term,  and  ongoing  work \nopportunities with Signal were false, and Defendants knew it. \n154.  These  representations  were  made  in  furtherance  of Defendants'  conspiracy to \nunlawfully recruit Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, and bring them to the United States under \nfalse pretenses to work at Signal. \n155.  Plaintiffs were entitled to rely on Defendants' representations and were ignorant \nof their falsity. \n156.  In  reliance  on  Defendants'  false  representations  regarding  green  cards  and \nemployment opportunities, Plaintiffs paid large sums of money-over $16,000 USD-to the \nRecruiter Defendants, which acted in concert with each other and with Signal, and on Signal's \nbehalf as Signal's agents, in the perpetration of this fraud. \n157.  In  reliance  on  Defendants'  false  representations  regarding  green  cards  and \nemployment opportunities, Plaintiffs incurred substantial interest-bearing debts (as high as 14%) \nin order to pay the recruitment fees charged by the Recruiter Defendants, which acted in concert \nwith each other and with Signal, and on Signal's behalf as Signal's agents, in the perpetration of \nthis fraud. \n158.  In  reliance  on  Defendants'  false  representations  regarding  green  cards  and \nemployment opportunities, Plaintiffs sold personal property and, in the case of Plaintiff Singh, \nsurrendered stable employment in the United Arab Emirates. \n42 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 43 of 47\n• \n159.  In  reliance  on  Defendants'  false  representations  regarding  green  cards  and \nemployment opportunities, Plaintiffs left their homes and traveled to the United States to work \nfor Signal. \n160.  No later than the Fall of 2006, all Defendants knew that Plaintiffs believed that \nDefendants  were  going  to  apply  for  permanent  residency  on  behalf of Plaintiffs.  While \nDefendants had an obligation to tell Plaintiffs that this was untrue, Defendants failed to do so. \nInstead, Defendants again falsely represented that Plaintiffs would receive green cards to induce \nthem further to pay thousands of dollars, to go to the United States to work for Signal, and to \nacquiesce to Signal's discriminatory and oppressive policies and conduct. \n161.  Defendants' actions evince malice and/or reckless indifference towards Plaintiffs. \n162.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' knowing, willing, and intentional \nactions,  each Plaintiff has  been injured and is  entitled to  recover compensatory and punitive \ndamages in an amount to be proven at trial. \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nNEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTA nON \nAll Defendants \n163.  Each Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs. \n164.  Each Plaintiff brings this claim against all Defendants. \n165.  As set forth  in the preceding paragraphs, Defendants, individually and through \ntheir  agents,  employees,  representatives,  and  co-conspirators,  provided  materially  false  and \nuntrue information to Plaintiffs, or omitted material facts, regarding the nature and terms and \nconditions  of applications  and  opportunities  for  immigration  status  and  employment  in  the \nUnited  States.  Specifically,  Defendants,  individually  and  through  their  agents,  employees, \n43 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 44 of 47\n1 \nrepresentatives, and co-conspirators, told Plaintiffs that they were processing or going to process \nthem for a green card and long-term employment with Signal, and that Plaintiffs would obtain \nsuch green card if they paid the Recruiter Defendants' fees.  Defendants and/or their respective \nagents  represented  that,  in  exchange  for  exorbitant fees,  Plaintiffs  would  obtain permanent \nresidency in connection with working for  Signal and that Plaintiffs would have steady,  long-\nterm, and ongoing work opportunities in the United States with Signal.  This information was \nmaterially false  and  untrue.  Furthermore,  Defendants failed  to  inform Plaintiffs  that  Signal \nwould compel them to  live  in camps unfit for  human habitation,  that  Signal would  impose \ndiscriminatory room-and-board deductions and policies, and that Signal would neither extend \ntheir H-2B visas nor sponsor them for green cards. \n166.  Defendants provided this information negligently, without exercising reasonable \ncare in communicating the information to Plaintiffs.  Defendants had no reason to believe their \nrepresentations about green cards and employment opportunities were true. \n167.  Plaintiffs were entitled to rely on Defendants' representations. \n168.  In  reliance  on  Defendants'  misrepresentations  and omissions of material  facts \nregarding green cards and employment opportunities, Plaintiffs paid large sums of money to \nRecruiter Defendants, which acted in concert with each other and with Signal, and on Signal's \nbehalf as Signal's agents, in making the negligent misrepresentations alleged herein. \n169.  In reliance on Defendants'  misrepresentations  and  omissions  of material facts \nregarding  green  cards  and  employment opportunities,  Plaintiffs  incurred substantial  interest-\nbearing debts in order to pay the recruitment fees charged by the Recruiter Defendants, which \nacted in concert with each other and with Signal, and on Signal's behalf as Signal's agents, in the \nmaking the negligent misrepresentations alleged herein. \n44 \n\n,  Case 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 45 of 47\n, \n170.  In  reliance on Defendants'  misrepresentations  and  omissions of material facts \nregarding green cards and employment opportunities, Plaintiffs sold personal property and, in the \ncase of Plaintiff Singh, surrendered stable employment in the United Arab Emirates. \n171.  In  reliance  on  Defendants'  misrepresentations  and  omissions  of material facts \nregarding green cards and employment opportunities, Plaintiffs left their homes  in India and \ntraveled to the United States to work for Signal. \n172.  No later than the Fall of 2006, all Defendants knew that Plaintiffs believed that \nDefendants  were  going  to  apply  for  permanent  residency  on  behalf of Plaintiffs.  While \nDefendants owed a duty to  Plaintiffs to correct any misperception in this regard, Defendants \nfailed to do so. \n173.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' negligent actions, each Plaintiff \nhas been injured and is entitled to recover compensatory and punitive damages in an amount to \nbe proven at trial. \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nBREACH OF CONTRACT \nAll Defendants \n174.  Each plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n175.  As set forth in the preceding paragraphs, Defendants, individually and/or through \ntheir  agents,  employees,  and/or  representatives,  offered  to  obtain  permanent  residence  and \nimmigration  status  for  Plaintiffs  in  the  United  States  as  well  as  steady,  long-term  work \nopportunities in the United States with Signal in exchange for Plaintiffs' payment of exorbitant \n45 \n\n.. \nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 46 of 47\n• \nfees to Defendants or their employees, agents, and/or representatives, and agreement to work for \nSignal. \n176.  Plaintiffs accepted Defendants' offers, paid the agreed upon fees, and performed \nthe agreed-upon work. \n177.  Defendants breached their contracts with Plaintiffs by failing to comply with their \nbinding promises regarding permanent residence and immigration status. \n178.  In reliance on these agreements, Plaintiffs paid large sums of money and entered \ninto substantial debts, surrendered other employment opportunities, and incurred other financial \nlosses. \n179.  As a direct result of Defendants' breach, Plaintiffs have suffered damages and are \nentitled to recover compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request the following relief: \na.  Compensatory damages; \nb.  Punitive damages; \nc.  An award of Plaintiffs' reasonable costs, including attorneys' fees and costs; \nd.  Such additional and further relief as the Court may deem just and appropriate. \nDEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL \nPursuant to Rule 38 ofthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiffs demand trial by \njury in this action of all issues so triable. \n46 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00732-SM-DEK   Document 1   Filed 10/15/13   Page 47 of 47\n• \nDated: October II, 2013 \nMCDUFF & BYRD \nRobert B.
