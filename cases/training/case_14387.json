It is stayed during defendant's bankruptcy and settlement proceedings.</p><p>On May 21, 2013, 17 Indian guestworkers filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas for harm suffered as a result of an allegedly fraudulent and coercive employment recruitment scheme. Plaintiffs filed this suit after District Judge Jay Zainey <a href=\"http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/IM-LA-0010-0016.pdf\">denied class certification</a> on Jan. 3, 2012, in a related case, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14377\"><i>David v. Signal International</i></a>.</p><p>Plaintiffs were allegedly brought into the United States to provide labor and services to defendant Signal International at its Orange, Texas site. Signal was based in Pascagoula, Mississippi and was in the business of providing repairs to offshore oil rigs in the Gulf Coast region. The complaint alleged that plaintiffs paid defendant Signal's recruiters as much as $20,000 for travel, visa, and recruitment fees, but, upon arrival in the United States, found that they would not receive the green cards promised to them. Instead, plaintiffs were forced to pay additional fees ($1050 per month) to live in racially segregated labor camps, and were subject to squalid living conditions and threats of both legal and physical harm if they complained about the conditions or decided not to provide labor. </p><p>Plaintiffs asserted claims under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (18 U.S.C. §1589 (forced labor) and 18 U.S.C. §1590 (trafficking)), the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act (18 U.S.C. §1962), the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. §1981), the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. §1985), the Thirteenth Amendment, Declaratory Judgment Act (28 U.S.C. §2201), Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. §201 et seq) as well as claims of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract. Plaintiffs were represented by a private law firm.</p><p>In December 2013, Magistrate Judge Zack Hawthorn denied Signal's motion to transfer this case to the Eastern District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs in this case only overlapped with the <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14377\"><i>David</i></a> case insofar as their FLSA claims in the <i>David</i> case were concerned. Additionally, the plaintiffs in this case sued based on events at Signal's Orange, Texas site, whereas plaintiffs in cases pending in the Eastern District of Louisiana sued based on events at Signal's Pascagoula, Mississippi site. 2013 WL 12138878. Although the Court declined to transfer this case, on May 30, 2014, Magistrate Judge Hawthorn entered a consent order that discovery from the cases in the Eastern District of Louisiana would be allowed to be used here. Additionally, in December 2014, Magistrate Judge Hawthorn severed and transferred Signal's cross-claims against co-defendants (immigration attorneys, recruiters, and labor brokers) to the Eastern District of Louisiana. </p><p>In October 2014, Magistrate Judge Hawthorn granted Signal's motion to compel production of plaintiffs' T- and U-visas and applications for such visas. 2014 WL 12597395. Although a similar motion had already been denied for the cases pending in the Eastern District of Louisiana, the court found that the materials' relevance outweighed any potential in terrorem effect. The Court warned that it would reconsider if Signal sought discovery that was clearly aimed at harassment. </p><p>In July 2015, the court stayed the case after Signal filed for bankruptcy. <i>In re Signal Int’l, Inc, et al.,</i> No. 15-11498 (Bankr. D. Del. July 12, 2015). As a part of the bankruptcy filings, the plaintiffs entered into a plan support agreement (PSA) which contemplated a settlement of the claims of this lawsuit against Signal entities through a consensual Chapter 11 plan proposed by Signal. The PSA, with a liquidation trust for distribution of settlement proceeds, became effective on Dec. 14, 2015.</p><p>In Dec. 2015, in the <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14378\">related EEOC case</a>, the EEOC announced that the parties had reached a <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/12-18-15.cfm\">settlement</a> for all cases, approved by the bankruptcy court. Signal would pay $5 million to 476 guestworkers through a claims process. All aggrieved individuals included in the litigation could receive relief in spite of the bankruptcy proceedings. Signal's CEO also issued an apology for its conduct.</p><p>In this case, <i>Samuel</i>, the parties are updating the court every 120 days as to the status of the bankruptcy proceedings. As of the parties' most recent update to the Court was on November 8, 2019. The update reported that the defendant Signal's bankruptcy proceedings closed on February 5, 2019, and that the distribution from the Signal Trust should occur in the next few months. </p><p>As of November 22, 2019, the case is still ongoing. </p>",

Plaintiffs in this case were absent putative class members in the case of David, et \nal. v. Signal International, et al. ,  United  States  District  Court  for  the  Eastern  District  of \nLouisiana, No. 08-1220 (SM/DEK).  In David, twelve individuals alleged various federal and \nstate claims for themselves and a putative class arising out of an alleged labor trafficking scheme \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 96   Filed 05/30/14   Page 2 of 5 PageID #:  2295\n     \nwhich resulted in hundreds of workers from India being employed by Signal in Mississippi and \nin Texas. \n2.  Judge Zainey denied a motion for class certification in the David case, id., Dkt. \n1117 (January 4, 2012).  Plaintiffs in this Joseph case and different sets of plaintiffs in several \nother cases noted below filed lawsuits in this District and in the Southern District of Mississippi \nagainst groups of Defendants, varying by case, which overlapped with those sued in the David \ncase, and alleging individual claims arising out of the alleged labor trafficking scheme described \nin David.   The cases filed in the Southern District of Mississippi have been transferred to the \nEastern District of Louisiana.  These other cases (“the related individual cases”), with a different \nset of individual plaintiffs in each and with several common defendants in each, are as follows: \n•  David, et al. v. Signal Int’l, LLC, et al., No. 08-1220 (SM/DEK) (E.D. La.);   \n•  Achari, et al. v. Signal Int’l, LLC, et al., No. 13-6218 (SM/DEK) (E.D. La.);  \n•  Chakkiyattil, et al. v. Signal Int’l, LLC, et al., No. 13-6219 (SM/DEK) (E.D. La.); \n•  Joseph, et al. v. Signal Int’l, LLC, et al., No. 13-CV-00324-RC-ZHI (E.D.Tex.); \n•  Krishnakutty, et al.  v.

Signal Int’l, LLC, et al., No. 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH (E.D. \nTex.).  \n3.  In addition, the EEOC has filed a lawsuit (“the EEOC case”) against Signal, \nwhich has been joined by the David plaintiffs, EEOC v. Signal Int’l, LLC , et al., 12-00557 \n(SM/DEK) (E.D. La.). \n  4.  The related individual cases and the EEOC case will hereinafter be referred to as \n“the Related Cases.”  \n  5.  The parties in this case who have expressed a view on the issue agree that it will \nbe most efficient and economical for all parties if all discovery produced or taken in the Related \nCases, including documents produced, written discovery responses and deposition testimony, is \nmade available to the parties for use in this case as if the discovery had been taken for use in this \ncase.   \n  6.  The parties in this case who have expressed a view on the issue agree that the \nSamuel Plaintiffs may attend and/or participate in depositions which have been scheduled in the \nRelated Cases.  Such attendance and/or participation does not waive the Samuel Plaintiffs rights \nto  notice  other  depositions,  including  Rule  30(b)(6)  depositions,  and  the  Samuel  Plaintiffs \nspecifically reserve the right to depose previously deposed witnesses on topics germane to the \nSamuel Plaintiffs to the extent those topics have not been addressed in previous depositions.  The \nSamuel Plaintiffs do not intend on duplicating depositions, however given the Signal Defendants \nposition on the sharing of the ESI produced in a portion of the Related Cases, the Samuel \nPlaintiffs cannot to commit to reviewing the yet unproduced data and be prepared for depositions \nstarting in a few weeks in the Related Cases. \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 96   Filed 05/30/14   Page 4 of 5 PageID #:  2297\n     \n  7.  The parties in this case all agree that the cost of securing multiple sealed original \ntranscripts  is  excessive  and  could  be  duplicative  in  the  circumstances  were  one  deposition \ntranscript is utilized in more than one trial.  The parties stipulate to the authenticity of deposition \ntranscripts  from  Related  Cases  and  agree  that  the  use  of  sealed  original  transcripts  is  not \nnecessary for deposition transcripts from Related Cases. \n  8.  Through counsel, Plaintiffs here and three groups of Defendants have consented \nto the entry of this Order.  The consenting defendants are the Signal Defendants (the four named \nSignal entities), the Burnett Defendants (Malvern Burnett and his law firms) and the Dewan \nDefendants  (Sachin  Dewan  and  Dewan  Consulting).    Global  Resources  (whose  principal, \nMichael Pol, is in bankruptcy) have been sent notice of this proposed Order, but have not \nobjected or responded.   \n  9.  For good cause shown, the Court hereby orders as follows: \n    (a)  Any  discovery  provided  by  any  party  in  any  of  the  Related  Cases, \nincluding  documents  produced,  responses  to  written  discovery  requests  and  deposition \ntestimony, shall be usable by any party in this case as if provided in and/or taken for use in this \ncase. \n    (b)  Any non-party discovery provided or taken in any of the Related Cases \nshall be usable by any party in this case as if provided in or taken for use in this case.  \n    (c)  Any  discovery  provided  as  confidential  under  any  protective  order  in \neffect in any of the Related Cases shall be similarly treated under the Protective Order in this \ncase. \n    (d)  The parties are expected to utilize discovery from the Related Cases to \nlimit the need for duplicative discovery in this case.  But all parties to this case reserve the right \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 96   Filed 05/30/14   Page 5 of 5 PageID #:  2298\n     \nto seek additional discovery on particular topics from any party or witness, subject to the rights \nof other parties and/or witnesses to seek a protective order on the ground that discovery in the \nRelated Cases has been sufficient in that regard. \nSO ORDERED \nSIGNED this 30th day of May, 2014.\n__________________________________________________\nZaacckk HHaawwtthhoorrnn\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n5",

In re Signal Int’l, Inc, et al., No. 15-11498 (Bankr. D. Del. July 12, 2015) in the United \nStates Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”).1  On November \n24, 2015, the Bankruptcy Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order \nConfirming Debtors’ First Amended Joint Plan of Liquidation Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the \nBankruptcy Code [ECF No. 555] (the “Confirmation Order”), confirming the Signal Entities’ \nplan of liquidation, which implemented the plan support agreement among the Plaintiffs, the \nSignal Entities and certain other parties, for the settlement of, inter alia, the Plaintiffs’ claims \nagainst the relevant Signal Entities.  Pursuant to the Plan, a litigation trust (the “Signal Litigation \nTrust”) has been created for the distribution of the settlement proceeds.  That process remains \nongoing, as the Signal Litigation Trust distributed Trust Claim Forms in February 2015 and the \nPlaintiffs submitted their claim forms.    \nThe Plan became effective on December 14, 2015.  As of that date, pursuant to the \nConfirmation Order, “any suit, legal action, or other proceeding … in any forum in the United \n                                                 \n1 The other entities are: Signal Ship Repair, LLC (Case No. 15-11499), Signal Int’l, LLC (Case \nNo. 15-11500), Signal Int’l Texas GP, LLC (Case No. 15-11501), and Signal Int’l Texas, L.P. \n(Case No. 15-11502).

Plaintiffs (as defined below) and approxi mately 590 Indian men, were trafficked \ninto the United States through the federal govern ment’s H-2B guest worker program to provide \nlabor and services (the “Indian H-2B W orkers”) to Defendants Signal  International L.L.C., \nSignal International, Inc., Signal International Texas, L.P., a nd Signal International Texas, G.P. \n(collectively “Signal”).  Recruited to  perform welding, pipefitting, and other m arine fabrication \nwork, Plaintiffs were subjected to forced labo r and other serious abuses at Signal operations in \nOrange, Texas. \n2.  Plaintiffs bring this action to recover  damages inflicted by Signal and Signal’s \nrecruiters and agents operating in India, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and the United \nStates.  Defendants, defined be low, have exploited and defra uded Plaintiffs by fraudulently \nrecruiting them to work in the Unite d States and effectuating a broad schem e of psychological \ncoercion, threats of serious harm and physical restraint, and threatened abuse of the legal process \nto maintain control over Plaintiffs. \n3.  Lured by, and in reliance upon, Defendants’  fraudulent prom ises of legal and \npermanent work-based  imm igration to th e U nited S tates f or them selves and  th eir f amilies, \nPlaintiffs plunged themselves and their fam ilies into debt to take advantage of thes e seemingly \npromising opportunities. Plaintiffs incurred sign ificant debts to pay m andatory recruitm ent, \nimmigration processing, and travel fees char ged by Defendants totaling as m uch as $12,000 to \n2 \n \n \n \n \nUS2008 4422703 12     \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 3 of 51 PageID #:  3\n \n$20,0001 per worker, equivalent to two to three year s of an Indian welde r’s salary working in  \nIndia.  Trusting the veracity of the immigra tion and work benefits prom ised by Defendants , \nPlaintiffs further relinquished stable employment opportunities in India and as guest workers in \nthe Persian Gulf and Singapore. \n4.  Defendants’ main recruiting agents in I ndia and the United  Arab Emirates held \nPlaintiffs’ passports and visas, and threatened, coerced, and defrauded  Plaintiffs into p aying \nextraordinary fees for recruitm ent, immigration processing, a nd travel.  Several Defendants \nfurther caused Plaintiffs to believe that if th ey did not work for Signal under the auspices of  \ntemporary, Signal-restricted, H-2B  guest worker visas, they woul d suffer abuse or threatened \nabuse of the legal process, physical restraint, or other serious harm. \n5.  The false promises, collection of exorbitant recruiting fees, and strong-arm tactics \nof Signal and its agents were, upon inform ation and belief, authorized by Defendant Signal.   \nDefendant Signal knew of the exorbitant fees charged and the Indian H-2B Workers’ green card \nexpectations by December 2006, before any of Plaintiffs arrived at Signal’s facility.  (Order and \nReasons Denying Class Certification, at 33, Kurian David, et al. v. Signal International, LLC, et \nal., 2:08-cv-01220-SM-DEK, (E.D.  La. Jan. 4, 2012), EC F No. 1117.)  Far from  taking any \ncorrective measures, Defendant Signal ratified  and perpetuated the schem e by continuing to \nfacilitate the transportation of additional waves of Indian H-2B workers,  including Plaintiffs , \nfrom December 2006 through February 2007.   \n                                                 \n1 Payments were made by Plaintiffs in both In dian Rupees and United States Dollars. For th e \npurposes of this Com plaint, all paym ents made in Indian Rupees  discussed throughout the  \nComplaint were converted to United States Dollars.   An exchange rate of 45 Indian Rupees to 1 \nUnited States Dollar was utilized as the approximate exchange rate for the relevant period.   \n3 \n \n \n \n \nUS2008 4422703 12     \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 4 of 51 PageID #:  4\n \n6.  Upon Plaintiffs’ arrival in the United  States, Defendant Signal required that \nPlaintiffs live in a guarded, overcrowded, and isolated labor camp located in Orange, Texas (the \n“Texas Labor Cam p”).  Defendants further d eceived Plaintiffs regarding their visa sta tus, \nthreatened Plaintiffs with arrest, loss of i mmigration status and deportation, and generally \nperpetrated a campaign of psychological abuse, coercion, and fraud designed to render Plaintiffs \nafraid, intimidated, and unable to leave Signal’s employ.  \n7.  Defendant Signal subjected Pl aintiffs to discriminatory and offensive mandatory \nroom and board arrangements at the Texas Labor  Camp to which non-Indian and United States  \ncitizen employees were not subjected.  More over, Defendant Signal  imposed upon Plaintiffs  \ndiscriminatory job-related requirem ents and ad verse terms and conditions of e mployment on \nPlaintiffs to which non-Indian and United S tates citizen em ployees were not subjected.   \nDefendant Signal subjected Plaintiffs to an objectively hostile and abusive work environment on \naccount of Plaintiffs’ race and alienage. \n8.  Plaintiffs assert claims against Defendants arising from violat ions of their rights \nunder the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act  (“TVPA”) (18 U.S.C. § 1581, et \nal.; the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Orga nizations Act (“RICO”); the Civil Rights Act of \n1866 (42 U.S.C. § 1981); the Ku Klux Klan Ac t of 1871 (42 U.S.C. § 1985); the Declaratory \nJudgment Act (28 U.S.C. §2201); and claim s fo r dam ages arising from  fraud, negligent  \nmisrepresentation, and breach of contract.  \n \n4 \n \n \n \n \nUS2008 4422703 12     \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 5 of 51 PageID #:  5\n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  This Court has jurisdiction over this acti on pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal \nquestion jurisdiction), 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a) (civil  trafficking), 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) (RICO), and \n28 U.S.C. § 1343 (civil rights). \n10.  This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the causes of action based on state \nlaw pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a), as the state law claim s arise out of the sa me nucleus of \noperative facts which support the federal claims. \n11.  Venue is proper in the Eastern District  of Texas under 18 U.S.C. § 1965 and 28 \nU.S.C. § 1391 in that Defendants  and/or agents of Defendants,  resided or have been found in \nOrange, Texas during the relevant time periods and a substantial portion of the communications, \ntransactions, events  or om issions underlying P laintiffs’ claim s occurre d to se cure labor for \nSignal’s Orange, Texas operations in this judicial district. \n12.  Declaratory relief is sought under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 et seq.   \nPARTIES   \nPlaintiffs \n13.  Plaintiffs are of South Asian Indian des cent, Indian nationals, and form er H-2B \nguest workers who were recruite d from India or the United Ar ab Emirates by Defendants at \nvarious times within calendar years 2006 and 2007. \n14.  Plaintiffs are members of a racial minority, as contemplated by 42 U.S.C. §1981.  \n15.  At all relevant times, Plaintiffs were “persons” within the meaning of that term as \ndefined by RICO, 18 U.S.C. § 1961(3). \n16.  At all relevant times, Plaintiffs were employed by Defendant Signal. \n5 \n \n \n \n \nUS2008 4422703 12     \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 6 of 51 PageID #:  6\n \n17.  At all relevant times, Defendants were engaged in interstate commerce or in the  \nproduction of goods for sale in interstate commerce. \n18.

Acting as Defendant Signal’s recruiting agent for the purposes of facilitating the \nrecruitment of Indian H -2B Workers for em ployment at Signal, Recruiter Defendants placed \nadvertisements in newspapers throughout India and the United Arab Em irates in the spring, \nsummer, and fall of 2006 offering opportunities  for welders and pipefitters to imm igrate \n14 \n \n \n \n \nUS2008 4422703 12     \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 15 of 51 PageID #:  15\n \npermanently to the United States under the auspices of Signal, “a leading marine and fabrication \ncompany in Mississippi and Texas.”  Plaintiffs were targeted for recruitment on the basis of their \nrace or alienage.   \n73.  Recruiter Defendants’ advertisements and other recruiting efforts were undertaken \non behalf of, at the direction of, or in coordi nation and consultation with Defendant Signal and \nBurnett Defendants. \n74.  Recruiter D efendants’ advertisem ents  and other recruiting  efforts prom ised \n“permanent residency” or “green cards.” \n75.  In response to the advertisem ents poste d by Recruiter Defenda nts, Plaintiffs \ncontacted Recruiter Defendants in the spring,  summer and fall of 2006  via telephone and in-\nperson meetings. \n76.  Specific facts relevan t to the experiences  of Plaintiffs are se t forth in the table  \nattached as Exhibit 1 to this Complaint, which are incorporated herein by reference. \n77.  Upon information and belief, Defendant Si gnal’s direction and coordination of \nRecruiter Defendants’ and Burnett Defendants’ recruitment efforts were effectuated by the use of \nnumerous telephone, fax, e-mail, or mail communications that occurred from the spring of 2006 \nthrough at least January 2007. \n78.  Upon inform ation and belief, in th ese communications Defendant Signal \nauthorized Recruiter Defendants and Burnett Defendants to act as their agents for the purposes of \nrecruiting and providing Indian welders and pipefitters to fill anticipated H-2B guest worker jobs \nat Signal’s Orange, Texas operations. \n15 \n \n \n \n \nUS2008 4422703 12     \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 16 of 51 PageID #:  16\n \n79.  Upon information and belief, in these co mmunications, Defendant Signal further \nauthorized Recruiter Defendants and Burnett Defendants to represent that Signal would agree to \nsponsor bona fide green card applications for Plaintiffs  and obtain at least two H-2B visa \nextensions on behalf of Plaintiffs to allow them to remain in the United States working for Signal \nwhile their green card applications were being processed. \n80.  Defendant Signal authorized these repr esentations even though it knew or had \nreason to know that such vi sa extensions and green card  applications would not be  bona fide, \nvalid, or lawful under United States imm igration law and even though Signal did not have the \nintention at that time to apply for visa extensions or green cards on behalf of all the Indian H-2B \nWorkers, including Plaintiffs. \n81.  At the latest, Defendant Signal knew th at the H-2B W orkers paid exorbitant \nrecruitment fees to Signal’s agents – Recruiter Defendants and Burnett Defendants – and m ade \nthose payments on the basis of p romises, namely that the workers wo uld receive green cards, \nwhich Signal knew to be false.  Defendant Si gnal nonetheless continue d to  f acilitate the \ntransportation, to Signal worksites in Texas an d Mississippi, of hundreds m ore Indian H-2B \nWorkers, including Plaintiffs, because it was in Signal’s financial interest to do so. \n82.  In the spring, summer, and fall of 2006, Pl aintiffs attended m eetings at which \nRecruiter Defendants and Burnett Defendants, actin g on Signal’s behalf, info rmed Plaintiffs of \nthe opportunity to work for Defendant Signal on H- 2B visas which were represented to lead to \npermanent resident (green card) status. \n83.  Upon infor mation and belief, prior to attending these m eetings and testing \nsessions (discussed in paragraphs 91 to 95 below), Defendant Signa l, Recruiter Defendants, and \n16 \n \n \n \n \nUS2008 4422703 12     \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 17 of 51 PageID #:  17\n \nBurnett Defendants conferred in the spring, su mmer, and fall of 2006 by phone, m ail, fax or e-\nmail to organize, plan, and coordinate the logistics and substantive content of these meetings. \n84.  The United  States -based Recruiter De fendants (Pol and Global), Burnett \nDefendants, and Defendant Signal traveled across state and international lines to attend meetings \nwith Plaintiffs in India and the United Arab Emirates in the spring, summer, and fall of 2006. \n85.  According to the statem ents made at  these meeting s and in comm unications \neffected by wire and mail during this tim e period, Defendant Signal repr esented that it would \nsponsor Plaintiffs’ green card applications and extend their H-2B  visas multiple times to enable \nPlaintiffs to work in the United States while  their green card applications were pending. In \nexchange, each Plaintiff was required to pay fe es totaling as m uch as 8 lakh rupees ($20,000), \neach in a series of approximately three installments. \n86.  Plaintiffs were furthe r inform ed by  Recruiter Defendants and/or Burnett  \nDefendants that Plaintiffs would be able to obtain le gal permanent residence for their spouses \nand children. \n87.  At informational meetings and in telephone  conversations, faxes, contracts, and \nother written documents transmitted through the use of mail and wire communications occurring \nduring the spring, sum mer and fall of 2006, Recr uiter Defendants and Burnett Defendants, \npersonally or through their agents, representatives,  or employees, represented to Plaintiffs that: \nDefendant Signal would provide lawful, stable , and ample employment opportunities; working \nunder an H-2B visa for Signal was not inconsis tent with applying for perm anent immigration \nstatus sponsored by Signal; a nd, Signal would obtain for P laintiffs work-authorized green cards \nenabling Plaintiffs to permanently and legally reside in the United States with their families. \n17 \n \n \n \n \nUS2008 4422703 12     \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 18 of 51 PageID #:  18\n \n88.  In such co mmunications with Plainti ffs, Recruiter Def endants and Burnett \nDefendants further promised to ac t diligently and to do everything nece ssary to ensure that  \nPlaintiffs would obtain green cards within 24 months of initiating the green-card process. \n89.  In reasonable reliance upon these and ot her contractually-binding promises made \nto them regarding green cards and work opport unities in the United Stat es, Plaintiffs signed \ngreen card contracts at various points from  mid-2006 to early 2007 with Recruiter Defendants  \nand Burnett Defendants pursuant to which Plainti ffs promised to pay the fees charged by these \nDefendants. \n90.  Contracts signed by Plaintiffs and other  documents provided to Plaintiffs by \nBurnett Defendants and Recruiter Defendants thr ough the use of m ail or wire transm issions in \nand around m id-2006 through at  least early 2007, further prom ised that Plaintiffs would \npromptly receive a refund of all  or nearly all of their pay ments if these Defendants did no t \nsucceed in securing green cards for Plaintiffs, as promised. \n91.  Burnett Defendants and  Recruiter Defendants kne w or should have known, \nhowever, that they would not refund Plaintiffs’  money as prom ised in the contracts and other \ndocuments. \n92.  Burnett Defendants and Recruiter Defendants induced Plaintiffs to enter the green \ncard contracts even th ough such defendants did  not intend to pursue diligen tly Plaintiffs’ \napplications and without any basis whatsoever fo r representing, inter alia, that Defendant Signal \nhad lawful long-term employment opportunities to  provide Plaintiffs; that Signal could legally \napply for numerous H-2B visa extensions to main tain Plaintiffs’ presence in the United State s; \nthat working under an H-2B visa for Signal w as not inconsistent with applying for perm anent \n18 \n \n \n \n \nUS2008 4422703 12     \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 19 of 51 PageID #:  19\n \nimmigration status sponsored by Signal; that green card applications sponsored by Signal would \nbe valid and bona fide under U.S. immigration law; and that such applications were likely to be \nsuccessfully completed and approved within the promised timelines. \n93.  In reasonable reliance on Recruiter Defendants’ and Burnett Defendants’ explicit \nand repeated promises regarding the procurement of green cards and employm ent opportunities \nin the United States, Plaintiffs undertook considerable economic, personal and familial sacrifices, \nincluding the mortgaging or sale of personal property and other  incurrence of debt, in order to \namass the funds necessary to initiate the green card process with Defendant Signal. \n94.  In reasonab le reliance on the pro mises  of Recruiter Def endants and Burnett \nDefendants, Plaintiffs signed contracts with th ese Defendants and m ade the payments required \nby these contracts. \n95.  Plaintiffs would not have paid the f ees charged by Recruiter Defendants and  \nBurnett Defendants for green cards, visas, a nd employment opportunities had they known that \nthese Defendants’ promises and representations were false. \n96.  Plaintiffs would not have paid the f ees charged by Recruiter Defendants and  \nBurnett Defendants for green cards, visas, a nd employment opportunities had they known that \nthese Defendants had f ailed to dis close material facts con cerning the nature and  terms and \nconditions of the purported immigration and work opportunities offered. \nDeparture for Signal Operations in the United States \n97.  At various tim es during  the spring, summ er, and fall of  2006, em ployees of \nDefendant Signal traveled to various locations in India and the Un ited Arab Emirates and tested \nPlaintiffs’ welding and pipefitting skills in anticipation of employing them in the United States. \n19 \n \n \n \n \nUS2008 4422703 12     \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 20 of 51 PageID #:  20\n \n98.  Plaintiffs paid costs necessary to travel to the cities where these tests were held. \n99.  Plaintiffs paid admission fees in order to take these tests. \n100.  Plaintiffs attended and passe d these tests, which were ov erseen and graded by  \nDefendant Signal’s or Defendant Dewan’s agents, employees, or representatives. \n101.  Upon infor mation and belief, prior to attending these m eetings and testing \nsessions, D efendant Signal, Recruiter Defendant s, and B urnett Defendants conferred in the \nspring, summer, and fall of 2006 by phone, mail, fax or e-mail to organize, plan, and coordinate \nthe logistics and substantive content of these testing sessions. \n102.  On or about July 20, 2006 and August  17, 2006, the United States Department of \nLabor approved Signal’s labor certification applications for 590 H-2B workers for the period of \nOctober 1, 2006 through July 31, 2007. \n103.  In approving these labor certification applications, the United States Department \nof Labor relied on the accuracy of the applicants’ stated 10-month period of labor need. \n104.  On information and belief, the Departm ent of Labor is proh ibited by its internal \nguidelines from  granting labor certification ap plications without relying on the applicants’ \nstatement of temporary labor need. \n105.  In late August and early Septem ber  2006, the United S tates Citizenship and \nImmigration Service (“USCIS”) approved Signal’s H-2B visa petitions for 590 H-2B workers for \nthe period of October 1, 2006 through July 31, 2007. \n106.  In approving these visa petitions, the  USCIS relied on the purported accuracy of \nthe applicants’ stated 10-m onth period of labor  need and the representation that Defendant \nSignal’s need was based on a one time peak-load temporary demand. \n20 \n \n \n \n \nUS2008 4422703 12     \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 21 of 51 PageID #:  21\n \n107.  The USCIS m ust, according to regulation,  rely on the stated perio d of the \npetitioner’s labor need, see 8 C.F.R. 214.2(h)(6)(ii)(B) (2006). \n108.  Defendant Signal, Burnett Defendants,  and Recruiter Defendants knew that the \nstated period of need in Signa l’s applications for labor certifications and for H-2B visas were  \ninconsistent with Sign al’s projected actual labor need, and therefore Defendants knew these \nstatements to the United States Government were false. \n109.  Recruiter Defendants and Burnett Defendants used the H-2B visas, obtained from \nthe U.S. Governm ent on the basis of false statem ents by Defendant Signal and Burnett \nDefendants, to elicit certain payments from Plaintiffs. \n110.  Plaintiffs entered the United States  on H- 2B guest worker visas, issued by th e \nUnited States Government on the basis of fals e statements made by Defendant Signal and \nBurnett Defendants, in late 2006 and early 20 07 for the purposes of working for Defendant \nSignal at its Texas Labor Camp. \n111.  Around the time of USCIS visa ap proval, Plaintiffs made necessary preparations \nto travel to the United States on H-2B visas  to work for  Signal, including: paying to obtain \nnecessary travel and legal documents; making payments to the United States consulate, Recruiter \nDefendants and Burnett Defendants for m andatory H-2B visa and consular processing fees; \nattending H-2B visa interviews; and paying Recruiter Defendants for travel arrangements. \n112.  In order to secure H-2B  visas to work  for Signal, Plaintiffs were interviewed by \nrepresentatives of the United States Consular offices in Indian cities. \n21 \n \n \n \n \nUS2008 4422703 12     \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 22 of 51 PageID #:  22\n \n113.  These consular interviews necessitated that Plaintiffs pay the costs of travel from \ntheir homes or current places of  employment to various large In dian cities in cluding Chennai \n(Madras) and Mumbai (Bombay).  \n114.  Recruiter Defendants or Burnett Defendants, acting as Defendant Signal’s agents, \nrequired that Plain tiffs meet with Recruiter D efendants or Burnett Defe ndants in these Indian \ncities prior to attending their consular interviews. \n115.  Upon information and belief, prior to th ese meetings, Recruiter Defendants and \nBurnett Defendants discussed am ong them selves and w ith Defendant Signal by e-m ail, \ntelephone, or in-person communications the topics to be discussed and instructions to be given to \nPlaintiffs at these meetings. \n116.  At these pre-interview meetings, Recruiter Defendants and  Burnett Defendants \nensured that Plaintiffs were up-to-date on paying the fee installments required by their green card \ncontracts. \n117.  Defendants further requ ired that Plaintiffs pay an additio nal 35,000 to 45,000  \nrupees ($800 to $1,100) fee for H-2B visa processing. \n118.  Recruiter Defendants or Burnett Defendants required Plaintiffs to sign documents \npermitting Defendant Dewan to receive their visa -stamped passports from  the Consulate o n \nPlaintiffs’ behalf. \n119.  Recruiter Defendants or Burnett Defendants  also coached Plaintiffs on what to  \nsay during consular interviews. \n120.  Recruiter Defendants or Burnett Defendants  told Plaintiffs that if they did not \nfollow these ins tructions regarding the in terviews, Plaintiffs would not  receive their visas and \n22 \n \n \n \n \nUS2008 4422703 12     \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 23 of 51 PageID #:  23\n \nwould forfeit all of the money they had previously paid to Defendants, in addition to losing their \nopportunity to permanently immigrate to the United States. \n121.  During Plaintiffs’ consular interviews, th e consular official s took Plaintiffs’  \npassports from them. \n122.  Once Plaintiffs’ visas were approved, consul ar officials sent their passports, with \nH-2B visas affixed, directly to Defendant Dewan. \n123.  After receiving word th at Plaintiffs’ visas were approved, Recruiter Defendants  \nmade travel arrangements for Plaintiffs’ departures to the United States. \n124.  Before Plaintiffs could  leav e for the Un ited States,  however, Plain tiffs were \nrequired to attend final meetings in Recruiter Defendants’ office. \n125.  Such m eetings typically  took place m ere hours before  Plaintiffs’ scheduled \ndepartures to the United States, when Recruite r Defendants’ office was teem ing with anxious \nfellow Indian H-2B Workers awaiting departure to the United States. \n126.  At these meetings, Recruiter Defendants collected final installm ent paym ents \nrequired by Plaintiffs’ green card contracts. \n127.  Recruiter Defendants also required that Plaintiffs, most of whom do not or did not \nat the time read or speak English proficiently, sign English language documents with little or no \ntime for review, and did not allow Plaintiffs to keep a copy of the documents. \n128.  Recruiter Defendants refused to return Plaintiffs’ passports — which had been in \nDefendant Dewan’s possession since Plaintiffs’ H-2B visas were  approved by consular officials \n— until af ter Plaintiffs had paid the f inal installments of their f ees and signed m andatory \npaperwork. \n23 \n \n \n \n \nUS2008 4422703 12     \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 24 of 51 PageID #:  24\n \n129.  In forceful tones, Recruiter Defendants  or their staff de manded that Plaintiffs  \nquickly sign the m andatory documents, lest they miss the f lights to the  United Sta tes, which \nRecruiter Defendants had scheduled for them and forfeit the fees they had paid. \n130.  Without possession of their passports  and within this ru shed and hostile \natmosphere, Plaintiffs had no reasonable opportun ity to review, negotiate, or m ake any changes \nto the documents presented them. \n131.  On occasions when workers who appeared at the Mumbai office failed to present \nsufficient funds to pay the final installm ent required by the green card  contracts, Defendant \nDewan and his associates threatened to destroy or deface these workers’ passports. \n132.  Such threats were uttered in the presence of other workers, causing these workers \nto reasonably believe that they had no choice but to pay their final fee installments in full. \n133.  Based on Recruiter Defendants’ threateni ng and coercive beha vior during these \npre-departure meetings in Mumbai and the extraordinary and increasing levels of debt they had \nincurred to pay Recruiter Defendants and Burn ett Defendants for green card and H-2B visa \narrangements, Plaintiffs reasonably believed that they had no choice but to m ake the payments \nrequired by Recruiter Defendants and to travel to the United States to work for Defendant Signal.  \nNot until P laintiffs had f ulfilled all of  Def endants’ r equirements did Plaintif fs have their  \npassports and visas returned to them. \n134.  Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B Worker s traveled from M umbai to Defendant \nSignal’s operations in the U.S. at va rious times from late October 2006 to April 2007 on tickets \narranged by Recruiter Defendants. \n24 \n \n \n \n \nUS2008 4422703 12     \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 25 of 51 PageID #:  25\n \n135.  Defendant Signal collected Plaintiffs  at the Houston airport upon arrival and \ntransported them immediately to the Texas Labor Camp. \n136.  Pursuant to Defendant Signal’s instructions and arrangements, approximately 300 \nworkers were sent to Signal’s Pascagoula, Miss issippi facility (the “M ississippi Labor Ca mp” \nand collectively with the Texas L abor Cam p, the “Labor Cam ps”) and approxim ately 290 \nworkers were sent to the Texas Labor Camp upon arrival in the United States. \n137.  Plaintiffs had no choice but  to use Recruiter Defendants and Burnett Defendants \nto secure employment at Defendant Signal’s operations. \n138.  Plaintiffs had no choice but  to pay the fees charged by Recruiter Defendants and \nBurnett Defendants to secure employment at Defendant Signal’s operations. \n139.  Management personnel at Defendant Si gnal made the conscious and deliberate \ndecision to prohibit Plaintiffs from  securing employment at Signal’s oper ations either through \nanother recruiter or by bypassing recruiters altogether and applying directly with Signal. \nConditions at the Texas Labor Camp \n140.  Upon arrival at Defendant Signal’s Texas Labor Camp, Plaintiffs were shocked to \ndiscover that they were expected  to live in an  isolated, overcrowded labor cam p comprised of \ntrailer-like bunkhouses surrounded   by barbed-wire fences,  and accessible only b y a single, \nguarded entrance. \n141.  Defendant Signal’s Texas Labor Camp was lo cated in an isolated, industrial area \nmiles removed from s hopping areas, places of  worship, public transpor tation or residential \ncommunities.   \n25 \n \n \n \n \nUS2008 4422703 12     \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 26 of 51 PageID #:  26\n \n142.  Initially, there were no telephones and no internet access available for Plaintiffs to \ncommunicate outside of the Texas Labor Camp. \n143.  Initially, there were no telev isions available for Plaintiffs to keep apprised of \nevents outside of the Texas Labor Camp. \n144.  The Texas Labor Camp gates were cons tantly m onitored by security guards \nretained by Defendant Signal.  Signal’s security guards monitored Plaintiffs’ comings and goings \nby requiring them to show their employee identi fication badges and recording when Plaintiffs  \nentered and exited the Texas Labor Cam p. Signal’s security guards also search ed Plaintiffs’ \npackages and bags when they entered the Texas Labor Camp. \n145.  Except on rare occasions, Plaintiffs were not pe rmitted to receive visitors in the \nTexas Labor Camp. \n146.  Up to twenty-four men were housed in each bunkhouse and made to sleep in two-\ntiered bunk beds.  The bunk beds were so tightly  packed in the bunkhouses that it w as difficult \nfor workers to m ove about in the narrow passa geways between bunks or sit up in bed.  These \nhousing conditions violated OSHA regulations. \n147.  The Texas Labor Ca mp bunkhouses had insufficient to ilet and bathing facilities \nfor twenty-four men, one or two toilets per bunkhous e, resulting in long lines for the bathroom s \nbefore and after work shifts and unsanitary conditions due to unresolved plumbing problems that \nrendered the toilets inoperable. \n148.  Privacy was non-existent, and Plaintiffs  often experienced extrem e difficulty \nsleeping due to the constant noise resulting from  the close quarters and the com ings and goings \nof workers who worked on different shifts. \n26 \n \n \n \n \nUS2008 4422703 12     \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 27 of 51 PageID #:  27\n \n149.  Defendant Signal’s personnel and security  guards conducted surprise searches of \nthe dormitory areas of the bunkhouses, including searches of workers’ personal belongings. \n150.  Plaintiffs took their m eals in Defenda nt Signal’s m ess halls, which were only \nopen during limited hours. Due to unhygienic kitche n conditions, Plaintiffs frequently became \nill, sometimes requiring hospitalization. \n151.  Upon inform ation and belief, Defendant  Signal did not obtain the required \npermit(s) to furnish board at the Texas Labor  Camp, and the condition and sanitation of the  \nboard provided further violated federal, state, and/or local law including, inter alia, the U.S. Food \nand Drug Adm inistration Food Code 2005 2, as adopted and m odified by Texas Food \nEstablishment Rules.  25 Tex. Admin. Code. §§229.161 – 229.171, 229.173-229.175.  \n152.  Defendant Signal deducted labor camp f ees of approximately $35 per day ($245 \nper week, or approximately $1,050 per month) from Plaintiffs’ paychecks for these substandard \naccommodations and meals. \n153.  When Plaintiffs complained and asked to live outside th e Texas Labor Cam p, \nDefendant Signal initially refused and subsequently told workers that if they tried to live outside \nthe Texas Labor Camp Defendant Signal would still deduct the labor camp fees from Plaintiffs’ \nwages. As a result, Plaintiffs reasonably believed they had no choice but  to continue living in \nDefendant Signal’s Texas Labor Camp. \n154.  Defendant Signal only housed Indian H-2B Workers such as Plaintiffs in its Labor \nCamps, which other employees and m anagement at  Signal referred to  as the “res ervation(s)”.  \nUpon information and belief, United States citizens and other workers of non-Indian descent and \n                                                 \n2 Available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/food/guidanceregulation/ucm123926.pdf. \n27 \n \n \n \n \nUS2008 4422703 12     \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 28 of 51 PageID #:  28\n \nnon-Indian race were n either required nor allo wed to live in o r pay for accommodations  in \nSignal’s Texas Labor Camp. \n155.  Defendant Signal subjected Pl aintiffs to skills testing  and re-testing, on-the-job \ndiscipline, layoffs, periods witho ut work, l ack of safety precau tions, unfav orable job \nassignments, evaluation processes, and other a dverse employment actions to which non-Indian \nand United States citizen workers were not similarly subjected. \n156.  In addition, Defendant Signal’s Texas  Labor Camp personnel and supervisors \nfrequently used offensive language while speaking with or referring to Plaintiffs and other Indian \nH-2B Workers, and regularly insulted Plaintiffs on the basis of their race or alienage.  \n157.  During the first week  of employing Plaintiffs in th e United States, D efendant \nSignal did not reimburse Plaintiffs for any of the  expenses that Plaintiffs were required to incur \nas a pre-condition of seeking employment with Signal. \n158.  During the first two we eks of employing Plaintiffs, De fendant Signal deducted \napproximately $100 to $200 each week from  Plaintiffs’ checks for job-related to ol kits which \nSignal required Plaintiffs to purchase from Signal. \n159.  Defendant Signal personnel and m anagement regularly threatened Plain tiffs and \nother Indian H-2B Workers that if they did not continue worki ng for Defendant Signal, did not \nwork according to Defendant Signal’s specifications, or complained about the working or living \nconditions, Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B Workers would be deported back to India. \n160.  In the iso lated and guarded atm osphere of the Texas Labor Cam p and saddled \nwith the crushing debts they had incurred to  come to the United States in reliance upon the \nDefendants’ representatives, Plaintiffs reasonably believed Signal’s statements were threatening \n28 \n \n \n \n \nUS2008 4422703 12     \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 29 of 51 PageID #:  29\n \nand believed they had no choice but to continue  working for Signal despite deplorable working \nand living conditions. \n161.  At regular m eetings and in one-on-one  or sm all group conversations with \nDefendant Signal’s Texas Labor Ca mp pers onnel and m anagement, som e workers voiced \ncomplaints regarding the discrim inatory trea tment to which Indian  H-2B Wo rkers were \nsubjected, but to which non-Indian and U.S. citizen workers were not similarly subjected.  \n162.  When De fendant Signal took no action in  response to workers’ complaints, \nnumerous Indian H-2B W orkers living at the  Texas Labor Ca mp, including Plaintiffs, began \nmeeting to discuss how to persuade Defendant  Signal to improve conditions in the Texas Labor \nCamp, and also began meeting with third parties to discuss how best to address their concerns.  \n163.  Upon information and belief, Defendant Si gnal became aware of these m eetings \nbetween workers, including Plaintiffs, and third parties whom Signal believed to be attorneys.  \n164.  Upon information and belief, Defendant Si gnal, through its employees or agents, \ncontacted Recruiter Def endants and Burnett Defe ndants to express its concerns about worker \norganizing efforts and the specific involvement of Plaintiffs.  \n165.  Upon information and belief, during thes e conversations Recruiter D efendants, \nBurnett Defendants, and Defendant Signal reached an agreem ent regarding steps to be taken to \ndiscourage further worker organi zing efforts and to ensure th at the Indian H-2B W orkers \ncontinued to work at Signal without com plaint, as well as to prevent the Indian H-2B W orkers \nfrom exercising their legal rights. \n166.  On March 9, 2007, Plaintiffs learned that  Defendant Signal used private security \nguards to raid Signal’s Mississippi Labor Camp.  \n29 \n \n \n \n \nUS2008 4422703 12     \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 30 of 51 PageID #:  30\n \n167.  Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B Work ers became increasingly frigh tened and \nconfused by these activities, particularly when word spread that Defendant Signal had locked up \nthe Mississippi Labor Ca mp Indian H-2B  Workers who com plained about the working \nconditions. \n168.  Plaintiffs learned of an I ndian H-2B Worker at the Mississippi Labor Camp who \nattempted suicide, rather than be deported  and face debts he had in curred in India to p ay \nRecruiter Defendants and Burnett Defendants. \n169.  Defendant Signal’s actions on and after  March 9, 2007 at the Mississippi Labor \nCamp significantly intensified the reasonable fears  of Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B Workers \nin the Texas Labor Camp that if they trie d to leave Defendant  Signal’s employ or oppose \nunlawful and coercive employment conditions at Defendant Signal, including by consulting with \ncounsel, they faced the threat of physical restraint, detention, forced deportation, or other serious \nharm or abuses of the legal process.  This r eaction was, upon information and belief, exactly the \nreaction Signal wanted and expected from the Indian H-2B Workers. \n170.  Throughout the spring and summer of 2007, Signal personnel in the Labor Camps \nheld various m eetings with Plaintiffs and other  Indian H-2B Workers to discuss the status of \nPlaintiffs’ and other Indian H-2B Workers’ visas and green card applications. \n171.  Defendant Signal officials held a m eeting with the In dian H-2B W orkers, \nincluding Plaintiffs.  Defendant Si gnal indicated that they had se lected Plaintiffs to continu e \nworking, promising visa extensions in July 2007. \n172.  In the summ er of 2007, an Indian H-2B  Worker was arrested by im migration \npolice in a town near th e Texas Labor Camp because his visa had expired.  Plaintiffs knew that \n30 \n \n \n \n \nUS2008 4422703 12     \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 31 of 51 PageID #:  31\n \nworker to be one whom Defendant Signal had promised to extend a visa.  Hearing of this arrest, \nPlaintiffs’ fear of leaving the barbed-wire fence that surrounded Texas Labor Camp increased. \n173.  Defendant Signal representatives then m et with Indian H-2B W orkers and told \nthem not to leave the Texas Labor C amp because if anyone ended up in  jail due to immigration \nissues, Defendant Signal would not pay the bond required to release them. \n174.  In meetings and conversa tions in the spring and summ er of 2007, Defendant \nSignal, through its agents and em ployees at the  Texas Labor Camp, continued to promise that \nDefendant Signal would arrange for the H-2B vi sa extensions and green cards originally \npromised Plaintiffs when they were recruited in India and the United Arab Emirates. \n175.  While Defendant Signal promised to arrange for H-2B visa extensions and green \ncards for Plaintiffs, Signal in fact was secretly evaluating all of the Indian H-2B Workers with no \nintention of applying for visa extensions for certain of the Indian H-2B Workers. \n176.  Plaintiffs’ continuing dependence on Defendant Signal for their present and future \nimmigration status, their continuing high levels  of indebtedness, as  well as o ther factors  \nreasonably led Plaintiffs, whose e mployment had not been terminated by Signal, to fear serious \nharm and abuse of the legal process if they left Signal’s employ.  \n177.  Under such circumstances, Plaintiffs reasonably felt like they had no choice but to \ncontinue working for Signal. \n178.  At various  tim es relev ant to P laintiffs’ claim s, Defendant Signal refused to \nconfirm whether valid H-2B  visa extensions had in fact been  obtained for Plaintif fs, coercing \nPlaintiffs to continue w orking for Signal in  the hope that Signal woul d finally resolve their  \nuncertain immigration status. \n31 \n \n \n \n \nUS2008 4422703 12     \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 32 of 51 PageID #:  32\n \n179.  Since first contracting with Def endants in India and the United Arab Em irates, \nPlaintiffs have yet to receive from Defendants the promised green cards or permanent residency.  \nDespite clear contractual provisi ons requiring them to do so, R ecruiter Defendants and Burnett \nDefendants have refused to refund any of the fees  Plaintiffs paid to them for unsuccessful green \ncard and visa processing. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nTHE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2003 \nForced Labor (18 U.S.C. § 1589) and 18 U.S.C. § 1590 (trafficking with respect to peonage, \nslavery, involuntary servitude, or forced labor) \nAll Defendants \n180.

' \n  ' \nv.    '    1:13-CV-323 \n  ' \nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL L.L.C.,   ' \net al.  ' \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON SIGNAL’S  \nMOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT (DOC. NO. 165) \n \nThis case is assigned to the Honorable Marcia A. Crone, United States District Judge, and \nis referred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge for all pretrial matters pursuant to a \nReferral Order.  (Doc. No. 5.)  Pending before the undersigned is a “Motion for Partial Summary \nJudgment” (Doc. No. 165) filed by Defendants Signal International, L.L.C., Signal International, \nInc., Signal International Texas, G.P., and Signal International Texas, L.P. (collectively, “Signal”).  \nSignal seeks summary judgment on three of the Plaintiffs’ claims, arguing that some claims are \ndefective as a matter of law, and that there is no genuine dispute of material fact as to others.  \nAfter  considering  the  parties’  briefing  (Doc.  Nos.  165,  187,  200,  209)  and  the  applicable \nauthorities, the undersigned recommends that Signal’s “Motion for Partial Summary Judgment” \n(Doc. No. 165) be denied. \nI. Background1 \nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, approximately 590 men, including the seventeen \nPlaintiffs in this case, were allegedly trafficked into the United States to provide labor for Signal’s \noperations.  (Doc. No. 1, pp. 2–9.)  The Plaintiffs claim that the Defendants made false promises \n                                                   \n1.  Local Rule CV-56(a) requires that a motion for summary judgment include a “Statement of Undisputed \nFacts.”  Signal’s “Statement of Undisputed Facts” contains both hotly contested facts, as well as legal conclusions.  \nTherefore, this section contains only a brief recitation of the background of this case and should not be construed as a \nstatement of facts. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 2 of 32 PageID #:  8726\nof “permanent work-based immigration to the United States,” and that to take advantage of this \npromising opportunity, the Plaintiffs allegedly “incurred significant debts to pay mandatory \nrecruitment, immigration processing, and travel fees . . . .”  (Id. at p. 2.)  After arriving at \nSignal’s facility in Orange, Texas, the Plaintiffs were allegedly subjected to serious abuses, \nthreatened with deportation if they left, and forced to live in substandard conditions.  In addition, \nthe Plaintiffs assert that they could not leave their jobs with Signal due to the large debts they \nincurred in their homeland.  Signal denies any wrongdoing and denies that the Plaintiffs were \nsubjected to forced labor, trafficking, or involuntary servitude.   \nA putative class action was filed in the Eastern District of Louisiana on behalf of all the \nworkers who had allegedly been trafficked to the United States to work at Signal’s facilities in \nTexas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.  (See Doc. 1, David v. Signal Int’l, L.L.C., 2:08-cv-1220 \n(March 7, 2008)).  The court in David denied class certification, which caused the individual class \nmembers to file suit where their alleged injuries occurred.  See David v. Signal Int’l, L.L.C., No \n08-1220, 2012 WL 10759668, at *37 (E.D. La. Jan. 4, 2012).  The Plaintiffs in this case worked at \nSignal’s facility in Orange, Texas, which is within this judicial district.  \nThe Plaintiffs are suing Signal, as well as Malvern C. Burnett, Gulf Coast Immigration \nLaw Center, L.L.C., Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C, Michael Pol, Global Resources, \nInc.,  Sachin  Dewan,  and  Dewan  Consultants  Pvt.  Ltd.  (a/k/a  Medtech  Consultants).    The \nPlaintiffs allege that some or all of the Defendants violated the following federal statutes: (1) the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003; (2) the Racketeer Influenced and \nCorrupt Organizations Act; (3) the Civil Rights Act of 1866; and (4) the Ku Klux Klan Act of \n1871.  (Doc. No. 1, pp. 32–50.)  In addition, the Plaintiffs assert causes of action for state law \nfraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract against all of the Defendants.  (Id.)  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 3 of 32 PageID #:  8727\nII. Legal Standard \n  “Summary judgment is proper ‘if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to \nany material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.’”  Rogers v. Bromac \nTitle Servs., L.L.C., 755 F.3d 347, 350 (5th Cir. 2014) (quoting FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a)).  “A \ngenuine dispute as to a material fact exists ‘if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could \nreturn a verdict for the nonmoving party.’”  Id. (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 \nU.S. 242, 248 (1986)).  “The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of \ninforming  the  court  of  the  basis  for  its  motion  and  identifying  portions  of  the  pleadings, \ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and affidavits, if any, which it believes \ndemonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.”  Gellhaus v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., \n769 F. Supp. 2d 1071, 1074 (E.D. Tex. 2011) (Crone, J.)  This burden is not met by “merely \nmak[ing] a conclusory statement that the other party has no evidence to prove its case.”  Inn \nFoods, Inc. v. Mida, No. 6:06-cv-169, 2008 WL 2078965, at *2 (E.D. Tex. May 15, 2008) \n(Schneider, J.) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 328 (1986)). \n  “If the moving party fails to meet this initial burden, the motion must be denied regardless \nof the nonmovant’s response.”  Id. at *2 (citing Little v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th \nCir. 1994)).  “If the movant does, however, meet this burden, the nonmovant must go beyond the \npleadings and designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Little, 37 \nF.3d at 1069.  The nonmovant’s “burden is not satisfied with some ‘metaphysical doubt as to the \nmaterial facts,’ by ‘conclusory allegations,’ by ‘unsubstantiated assertions,’ or by only a ‘scintilla’ \nof evidence.”  Id. at 1075 (internal citations omitted).  “Factual controversies are construed in the \nlight most favorable to the nonmovant, but only if both parties have introduced evidence showing \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 4 of 32 PageID #:  8728\nthat an actual controversy exists.”  Espinoza v. Cargill Meat Solutions Corp., 622 F.3d 432, 437–\n38 (5th Cir. 2010).  \nIII. Analysis \n  The Plaintiffs’ complaint contains seven claims for relief.  (See Doc. No. 1, pp. 32–50.)  \nSignal moved for summary judgment on three claims: violations of the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Reauthorization Act of 2003 (“TVPRA”), violations of the Racketeer Influenced and \nCorrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), and violations of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. \n§1985(3)).  (See Doc. No. 165.)  The undersigned will address Signal’s motion on a claim by \nclaim basis. \nA.  First Claim: Violations of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 \n \n  Congress passed the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 to \n“combat trafficking in persons.”  See Pub. L. No. 106-386, 114 Stat. 1464, 1446 (codified at 22 \nU.S.C. § 7101 et seq.).  This act was amended in 2003 to, inter alia, create a civil remedy for \ncertain violations of Chapter 77 of Title 18 of the United States Code.  See Trafficking Victims \nProtection Reauthorization Act of 2003 (“TVPRA”), Pub. L. No. 108-193, 117 Stat. 2875, 2878 \n(creating a civil remedy for violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1589, 1590, and 1591).  In their first cause \nof action, the Plaintiffs seek damages under the civil remedies provision of the TVPRA (18 U.S.C. \n§ 1595) for “forced labor” (18 U.S.C. § 1589) and “trafficking with respect to . . . forced labor” (18 \nU.S.C. § 1590).2 \n                                                   \n2.  The Plaintiffs’ complaint also alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1583, 1584, and 1592(a).  (Doc. No. 1, \npp. 32–34.)  The Plaintiffs’ response, however, is clear that they are abandoning their reliance on these statutes.  (See \nDoc. No. 187, p. 2) (“Plaintiffs have therefore determined to simplify the case by dismissing voluntarily their claim \nunder the TVPA to the extent it relies upon sections 1583, 1584, 1592(a) and 1592(b).”).  In addition, they have \nmoved for dismissal of their claims to the extent they are based on these statutes.  (Doc. No. 212.) \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 5 of 32 PageID #:  8729\n  Signal claims that it is entitled to summary judgment on the Plaintiffs’ trafficking claim (18 \nU.S.C. § 1590) because (1) the TVPRA did not apply extraterritorially at the time of the alleged \ntrafficking and (2) “‘that there is an absence of evidence to support’ the case of the Plaintiffs with \nregard to the scienter required by § 1590 . . . .” (Doc. No. 165, p. 20) (quoting Celotex Corp., 477 \nU.S. at 325).  As for the Plaintiffs’ claims premised on violations of §§ 1592 and 1594, Signal \nargues that summary judgment is warranted because imposing civil liability for violations of these \ntwo statutes would require an impermissible retroactive application of the TVPRA.   \na.  Applying  the  TVPRA  to  the  facts  of  this  case  constitutes  a  domestic—not \nextraterritorial—application of the statute \n \nSignal argues that the TVPRA did not apply extraterritorially at the time of the alleged \ntrafficking, and because the Plaintiffs’ trafficking claim stems from conduct that is “significantly \nextraterritorial,” their claim fails as a matter of law.  (Doc. No. 165, pp. 12–15.)  The Plaintiffs \ndo  not  dispute  that  the  TVPRA  had  no  extraterritorial  reach  prior  to  2008.   See  William \nWilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-457, \n122 Stat. 5044, 5071–72 (amending the TVPRA to confer extraterritorial jurisdiction).  Rather, \nthe Plaintiffs insist that they are merely seeking a domestic application of statute, and therefore, \nwhether the TVPRA can be applied extraterritorially is irrelevant.  (Doc. No. 187, pp. 13–17.)  \nThe undersigned agrees with the Plaintiffs, and finds that applying the TVPRA to the facts at \nhand—which involves trafficking workers into the United States—requires only a domestic \napplication of the statute.3   \nTo determine whether a statute is being applied extraterritorially or domestically, courts \nare to examine the facts of the case in light of the “‘focus’ of Congressional concern” in enacting \n                                                   \n3.  Because this case involves a domestic application of the TVPRA, the undersigned expresses no opinion \non whether the TVPRA had any extraterritorial reach prior to 2008.  Compare Adhikari v. Dauod & Partners, 994 F. \nSupp. 2d 831, 835–36 (S.D. Tex. 2014) (withdrawing a previous opinion and holding that the TVPRA did not apply \nextraterritorially prior to 2008).   \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 6 of 32 PageID #:  8730\nthe statute.  Morrison v. Nat’l Austl. Bank Ltd., 561 U.S. 247, 266–70 (2010) (“For it is a rare \ncase of prohibited extraterritorial application that lacks all contact with the territory of the United \nStates.”).  For example, in Morrison, the Supreme Court considered whether §10(b) of the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 was being applied domestically or extraterritorially.  Id.  The \nalleged misrepresentations that formed the basis of the claim were made in the United States and \nwere about an American company, but the securities that were affected were only traded on a \nforeign stock exchange.  Id. at 251–53.  The Supreme Court found that the focus of §10(b) was \n“transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges, and domestic transactions in other \nsecurities,” as opposed to where the misrepresentations occurred.  Id. at 267.  Therefore, because \nthe securities were only traded on a foreign exchange, as opposed to a domestic exchange, \nimposing liability would require an extraterritorial application of the statute. \nAfter reviewing the plain language of the TVPRA, as well as the legislative history, the \nundersigned finds that what is critical under the TVPRA is “where the forced labor occurred and to \nwhere to victims were trafficked, and not from where the victims were trafficked . . . .”  Tanedo v. \nE. Baton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., No. SA CV 10-01172, 2012 WL 5378742, at * 6 (C.D. Cal. Aug. \n27, 2012) (emphasis added) (reaching this conclusion based on a comparison to the facts of \nMorrison).  For example, the Congressional findings supporting the passage of the Victims of \nTrafficking  and  Violence  Protection  Act  of  2000—which  are  codified  at  22  U.S.C. \n§ 7101(b)—recognize  that  trafficking  victims  are  “trafficked  within  or  across  international \nborders,” and that “traffickers often transport victims from their home communities to unfamiliar \ndestinations, including foreign countries.”  22 U.S.C. § 7101(b)(1), (5); see also Tanedo, 2012 \nWL 5378742, at *6 (citing H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 106-939, at 1 (2000)).  Here, it is undisputed that \nthe Plaintiffs were eventually brought to the United States.  Accordingly, imposing liability under \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 7 of 32 PageID #:  8731\n§ 1590 requires only a domestic application of the statute.  (See Doc. No. 2077, David v. Signal \nInt’l, L.L.C., 2:08-cv-1220 (E.D. La. Jan. 6, 2015) (finding that the plaintiffs’ claims under the \nTVPRA are not extraterritorial)).   \nSignal argues that the undersigned should follow Adhikari v. Dauod & Partners, 994 F. \nSupp. 2d 831 (S.D. Tex. 2014), which dismissed a trafficking claim on the grounds that the \nTVPRA did not apply extraterritorially prior to 2008.  (See Doc. No. 165, pp. 13–17); see \nAdhikari, 994 F. Supp. 2d at 835–37.  Signal, however, overlooks a critical distinction—the \nworkers in Adhikari were not trafficked to the United States—they were trafficked from Nepal to \nIraq.4  Adhikari, 994 F. Supp. 2d at 835–37; see also John Roe I v. Bridgestone Corp., 492 F. Supp. \n2d 998, 990, 999–1002 (S.D. Ind. 2007) (holding that the TVPRA did not apply where the alleged \ninvoluntary servitude occurred solely in Liberia).  Thus, Adhikari is not on point.  \n  Accordingly, the undersigned agrees with the Plaintiffs and finds the that transporting or \nrecruiting of workers into the United States is a domestic—not extraterritorial—application of the \nTVPRA.  The fact that the Plaintiffs are foreign or some of the acts may have occurred abroad \ndoes not change the domestic character of the Plaintiffs’ claims. \nb.  The Plaintiffs have put forth enough evidence to create a genuine dispute of \nmaterial fact as to whether Signal is liable for trafficking \n \n  Signal next argues that summary judgment is warranted because “the Plaintiffs have no \nevidence to prove [] that Signal always subjectively intended to convert the recruited individuals \ninto involuntary, slave-like, forced laborers once they arrived in the United States.”  (Doc. No. \n165, p. 20.)  Signal’s argument has three parts.  First, § 1590 requires finding that Signal \n                                                   \n4.  Some of the workers were told that their ultimate destination would be an American military installation \nin Iraq, and the plaintiffs alternatively argued that Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (“MEJA”) made it a \ndomestic application of the TVPRA.  Adhikari, 994 F. Supp. at 833.  The court found this unpersuasive.  Id. at 837 \n(noting that “the Court [had] already expressed [an] unwillingness to rest its jurisdiction on the ‘murky area of the law’ \nthat is the MEJA”). \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 8 of 32 PageID #:  8732\n“knowingly” trafficked the Plaintiffs “for the purpose” of forced labor, which Signal argues \nrequires  “proof  of  the  specific  intent  associated  with  premeditated  crime.”    (Id.  at  p.  21.)  \nSecond, there is no evidence to show that Signal had such intent.  Third, to the extent that the \nPlaintiffs’ claim stems from “financial coercion” based on the large debts they incurred, this type \nof harm was not recognized under the TVPRA until 2008.  Therefore, according to Signal, to find \nliability based on financial coercion alone would require a retroactive application of the statute. \ni.  Mental state required under §1590 \n  It is unclear whether the parties truly dispute what is required to prove liability under \n§ 1590.  Signal argues that “what is required is proof that the recruits [were] being recruited for an \nunlawful form of labor, labor acquired through threats, for example, of serious harm.”  (Id.)  The \nPlaintiffs have not argued that a lesser showing is needed or that Signal is per se liable for \ntrafficking merely by recruiting workers.  However, to the extent that there is a dispute, the \nundersigned will address Signal’s argument.  \nSection 1590 states: “whoever knowingly recruits, harbors, transports, provides, or obtains \nby any means, any person for labor or services in violation of this chapter shall be fined under this \ntitle or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.”  18 U.S.C. §1590; see also 18 U.S.C. § 1594 \n(creating a civil remedy for violations of § 1590).  By its terms, § 1590 requires recruiting or \ntransporting a person with the knowledge that it is for, amongst other things, forced labor.  \n“Knowingly” means having the factual knowledge.  See United States v. Ho, 311 F.3d 589, 605 \n(5th Cir. 2002) (“[T]he term ‘knowingly’ does not have any reference to a state of mind or to \nknowledge of the law.  The knowledge requisite to a knowing violation of a statute is factual \nknowledge as distinguished from knowledge of the law . . . .”) (alterations in original) (quoting \nBryan v. United States, 524 U.S. 184, 192 (1998)).  Therefore, the Plaintiffs need to demonstrate \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 9 of 32 PageID #:  8733\nthat Signal had knowledge that workers were recruited or transported to be used as forced labor (or \nat least create a genuine dispute of material fact to survive summary judgment).  In other words, \n“[o]btaining the services of another person is not itself illegal; it is illegal only when accompanied \nby one of the three given circumstances [in §1589], and the jury must find that the defendant knew \nthat the circumstance existed.”  See United States v. Calimlim, 538 F.3d 706, 711 (7th Cir. 2008). \nAs noted above, it appears that the parties agree on this proposition.5  (Doc. No. 165, p. \n21); (Doc. No. 187, pp. 22–23.)  To the extent that Signal believes that some higher mental state is \nrequired, Signal has cited no authority for such a proposition. \nii.  The  Plaintiffs  have  put  forth  sufficient  evidence  of  forced  labor  and \ntrafficking to create a genuine dispute of material fact \n \n  Signal claims that “the freedom the plaintiffs exercised during their time at Signal is \nirreconcilable with the inference that these individuals were trafficked,” thus, it is entitled to \nsummary judgment.  (Doc. No. 165, p. 25.)  To support its argument, Signal presents  the \nPlaintiffs’ depositions, in which they testified about their ability to freely come and go from \nSignal’s facility.  (Id. at pp. 9–12.)  An example from Aby Raju’s deposition is illustrative: \nQ: Every time you wanted to walk out of the housing facility, so long as you signed \nyour name on the sign-out sheet, you can do that.  Right? \n \nA: If you are asking like that, that they would ask you, “Where are you going? What \ndo you have in your hand,” they examined that; when you are going out and coming \n                                                   \n5.  Perhaps the undersigned’s confusion stems from Signal’s extensive discussion of Morrissette v. United \nStates, 342 U.S. 246 (1952).  In Morrissette, the defendant was convicted for “knowingly” stealing and converting \ngovernment property.  Id. at 248.  The defendant admitted to taking the property, but argued that he believed that it \nhad been abandoned, and as such, did not “knowingly” convert the property.  Id.  The trial court, however, refused to \nallow this defense, which effectively read a mental state out of the statute.  Id. (noting that the trial court stated: “He \ntook it because he thought it was abandoned and he knew he was on government property. . . That is no defense . . . I \nwill not permit you to show this man thought it was abandoned.”).  The Supreme Court held that this was an error, and \nthat the statute required the defendant to know—as a matter of fact—that he was taking government property.  Id. at \n270–74.  Therefore, if the jury believed that he thought the property had been abandoned, he did not “knowingly” \nconvert government property.  To the extent that Morrissette instructs that the undersigned cannot simply read out of \nthe TVPRA the “knowingly” element (which the Plaintiffs have not urged), it is applicable.  Otherwise, the \nundersigned strains to understand Signal’s point. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 10 of 32 PageID #:  8734\nin, they check you in person; and then they would also look at your badge number \nand try and see your ID for when you are going out and coming back in, too.  \n \nQ: But my question is every time you wanted to go out, you can go out? \n \nA: Yes.  I could go out, but provided I meet all these conditions, then I could go \nout. \n \n(Id., Ex. 14, 70:12–24.)  The other Plaintiffs testified similarly.  (See id. at pp. 9–12.)  Signal \nargues that because the Plaintiffs were not kept under lock-and-key and physically had the ability \nto leave its facility, there can be no claim of forced labor.  In turn, because there is no claim of \nforced labor, there can be no claim for trafficking.  See 18 U.S.C. § 1590 (prohibiting the \ntrafficking of a person for forced labor).   \nSignal’s argument, however, is inconsistent with the TVPRA.  At the relevant time, 18 \nU.S.C. § 1589 prohibited knowingly providing or obtaining the labor or services of a person: \n(1) by threats of serious harm to, or physical restraint against, that person or another \nperson; \n   \n(2) by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause the person to believe \nthat, if the person did not perform such labor or services, that person or another \nperson would suffer serious harm or physical restraint; or \n \n(3) by means of the abuse or threatened abuse of law or the legal process. \nSee Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-386, 114 Stat. \n1478, 1486–87 (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1589).  By including the term “serious harm,” the statute \nexpressly sought to not just prohibit forced labor through physical restraint, but also other \noppressive  forms  of  “nonviolent  coercion”  as  well.    See  22  U.S.C.  § 7101(b)(1),  (13).  \nTherefore, Signal’s argument that summary judgment should be granted merely because the \nPlaintiffs could leave its facility does not comport with the definition of forced labor under the \nTVPRA.  The Plaintiffs can survive summary judgment by presenting evidence that creates a fact \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 11 of 32 PageID #:  8735\nissue as to whether they were forced to continue working for Signal through “physical restraint,” \nthreats of “serious harm,” or “abuse of law or the legal process.”  See 18 U.S.C. § 1589.   \nAfter reviewing the Plaintiffs’ evidence, the undersigned finds that there is a fact issue as to \nwhether the Plaintiffs were subjected to forced labor.  For example, Mr. Raju testified that Signal \nmade numerous threats that if he left Signal, he would be turned into immigration authorities.  \n(Doc. No. 187, Ex. 8, 210:11–18.)  “[M]any courts have determined that threats of deportation \nconstitute a condition of servitude induced through abuse of the legal process.”  Kiwanuka v. \nBakilana, 844 F. Supp. 2d 107, 115 (D.D.C. 2012) (collecting cases); but see Zavala v. Wal-Mart \nStores,  Inc.,  691  F.3d  527,  540–41  (3d  Cir.  2012)  (holding  that  “[a]bsent  some  special \ncircumstances, threats of deportation are insufficient to constitute involuntary servitude,” and that \nbecause the plaintiffs did not claim that they were compelled to go to work each day, nor forced to \nstay once their work was finished, and had considerable freedom to move to other cities and find \ndifferent jobs, there was no claim of involuntary servitude); (See also Doc. No. 2077, David v. \nSignal Int’l, L.L.C., 2:08-cv-1220 (Jan. 6, 2015) (finding that Signal was not entitled to summary \njudgment in part because “Plaintiffs have introduced evidence from which a jury could infer \nSignal knowingly threatened immigration consequences in order to maintain its forced labor”)).  \nThe other Plaintiffs tell similar stories about threats of deportation, and some even state that their \npassports were confiscated.  (Doc. No. 187, pp. 5–18.)  Furthermore, Biju George testified about \ntimes when he was not allowed to leave Signal’s facility.  (Id., Ex. 10, 88:7–89:15; 123:4–19.)  \nTherefore, there is a fact issue as to whether the Plaintiffs were able to freely leave Signal’s \nfacility.  Accordingly, given the Plaintiffs’ testimony and the broad definition of forced labor \nunder the TVPRA, there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to the Plaintiffs’ forced labor and \ntrafficking claims.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 12 of 32 PageID #:  8736\niii.  Financial  coercion  was  actionable  under  the  TVPRA  before  the  2008 \namendments \n \nSignal next argues that to the extent that the Plaintiffs’ trafficking claim is premised on the \nfact that the large debts that they undertook to pay the recruitment fees forced them to continue \nworking for Signal, this was not actionable under the TVPRA until 2008.  (Doc. No. 165, pp. 27–\n31.)  “Serious harm” was not defined in the original statute.  The 2008 amendments added a \ndefinition:  \nThe  term  “serious  harm”  means  any  harm,  whether  physical  or  nonphysical, \nincluding psychological, financial, or reputational harm, that is sufficiently serious, \nunder all the surrounding circumstances, to compel a reasonable person of the same \nbackground and in the same circumstances to perform or to continue performing \nlabor or services in order to avoid incurring that harm.   \n \nSee William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. \n110-457, 122 Stat. 5044, 5069.  Signal argues that because financial harm was added to the \nTVPRA in 2008, and “Congress does not legislate unnecessarily,” financial harm could not have \nbeen not part of the statute prior to 2008.  (Doc. No. 165, pp. 28–29.)  Therefore, Signal asserts \nthat  imposing  liability  based  on  financial  coercion  would  be  an  impermissible  retroactive \napplication of the 2008 amendments.  The Plaintiffs argue that the statute was broad enough, at \nthe time of the alleged trafficking, to encompass their claim of financial coercion.  (Doc. No. 187, \npp. 17–22.)   \n  The undersigned is not persuaded by Signal’s argument.  First, while financial coercion \nmay be a part of the Plaintiffs’ claim, it is not their only basis for imposing liability under the \nTVPRA.  As discussed above, there appears to be other alleged actions taken by Signal that meet \nthe definition of forced labor under the TVPRA.  Second, the plain language of the statute \ndemonstrates that it encompasses more than just threats of physical harm.  Forced labor was \ndefined at the relevant time as “threats of serious harm . . . or physical restraint.”  As the court in \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 13 of 32 PageID #:  8737\nTanedo noted: “That § 1589 distinguishes between serious harm and physical restraint indicates \nthat, prior to 2008, Congress intended that serious harm not be limited to physical harm, and \ninstead include at least some non-physical harm, e.g., financial harm.”  Tanedo, 2012 WL \n5378742 at *4.  The legislative history supports this reading.  “[T]he House Conference Report \nfrom 2000 [] stated that the [Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000] ‘refers to \na broad array of harms, including both physical and nonphysical,’ and would apply ‘where the \ntraffickers use more subtle means designed to cause their victims to believe that serious harm will \nresult to themselves or others if the leave’ such as threats of families’ ‘bankruptcy in their home \ncountry.’”  Id. (quoting H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 106-939, at 101 (2000)).  In addition, while not \ndirectly addressing a claim of financial coercion, the Fifth Circuit found that, prior to 2008, \n“serious harm [under §1589(a)] can include psychological coercion.”  United States v. Nnaji, 447 \nF. App’x 558, 559 (5th Cir. 2011) (per curiam). \n  Lastly, Signal cites no case applying such a narrow interpretation of “serious harm” under \nthe TVPRA.  As the Plaintiffs correctly note, the one case upon which Signal relies does not apply \nthe TVPRA, but rather is examining slavery as defined by international norms.  See Velez v. \nSanchez, 693 F.3d 308, 319–23 (2d Cir. 2012).6      \n  Because the goal of the TVPRA was to reach modern day slavery, which may take on \nmany forms, and “serious harm” should be interpreted broadly, the undersigned finds that the \nPlaintiffs’ claim of financial coercion was cognizable before 2008.  (See also Doc. No. 2077, \n                                                   \n6.  Interestingly, the district court in Velez dismissed a claim for forced labor under the TVPRA.  See Velez \nv. Sanchez, 754 F. Supp. 2d 488, 498–99 (E.D.N.Y. 2010).  The court converted the plaintiff’s claim from one \nbrought under the Alien Tort Statute to one brought pursuant to § 1589, but found that the evidence did not support \nsuch a claim.  Specifically, the court found that the plaintiff’s fear of being yelled at was not actionable and that “by \nher own admission, [she] never feared physical harm . . . .”  Id. at 498.  Therefore, neither opinion in Velez adopts \nSignal’s narrow interpretation.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 14 of 32 PageID #:  8738\nDavid v. Signal Int’l, L.L.C., 2:08-cv-1220 (Jan. 6, 2015) (holding that “serious harm under \npre-amendment Section 1589 includes financial harm”)).    \nc.  Retroactive application of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1592 and 1594 is no longer at issue \nSignal also argues that “Section 1595 did not authorize a private right of action for \nviolations of §§ 1592 or 1594 prior to [2008].”  (Doc. No. 165, p. 18.)  While Signal is correct \nthat the civil remedies provision of the TVPRA did not expressly encompass these statutes until \n2008, the Plaintiffs have abandoned their reliance on these sections (as well as §§ 1583 and 1584).  \n(See Doc. No. 187, p. 13 n. 11); (Doc. No. 212) (moving to voluntarily dismiss certain claims).  \nTherefore, there is no need to consider whether these sections apply retroactively. \nB.  Second Claim: Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) \nand 18 U.S.C. §1962(d) \n  The Plaintiffs’ second claim for relief consists of violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(c) and \n1962(d) of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”).  (Doc. No. 1, pp. \n34–43.)  Signal claims that it is entitled to summary judgment on the Plaintiffs’ RICO claims \nbecause: (1) the Plaintiffs failed to establish a distinct RICO enterprise; (2) RICO does not apply \nextraterritorially; and (3) there no proof of a conspiracy.  (Doc. No. 165, pp. 31–39.)    \na.  The Plaintiffs have alleged a distinct RICO person and RICO enterprise \n Signal argues that the Plaintiffs’ RICO claim is “structurally defective” because the \nPlaintiffs “allege both that Signal is a RICO ‘person’ and that Signal was a ‘member’ of all RICO \nEnterprises alleged in the Second Claim for Relief . . . .”  (Id. at p. 31.)  Signal’s argument \nmisconstrues the Plaintiffs’ complaint, as well as misapplies the law on the person/enterprise \ndistinction under RICO.  \n“RICO claims under § 1962 require: ‘(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of \nracketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 15 of 32 PageID #:  8739\nenterprise.”  Bradley v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 527 F. Supp. 2d 625, 645 (S.D. Tex. 2007) \n(quoting In re Burzynski, 989 F.2d 733, 741–42 (5th Cir. 1993)) (emphasis in original).  “To \nestablish liability under § 1962(c) one must allege and prove the existence of two distinct entities: \n(1) a ‘person’; and (2) an ‘enterprise’ that is not simply the same ‘person’ referred to by a different \nname.”  Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd. v. King, 533 U.S. 158, 161 (2001).  RICO defines a \n“person” as “any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property.”  \n18 U.S.C. §1961(3).  Signal does not dispute that it can be a RICO person.  See St. Paul Mercury \nIns. Co. v. Williamson, 224 F.3d 425, 447 (5th Cir. 2000) (“[A] corporation obviously qualifies as \na ‘person’ under RICO and may be subject to RICO liability.”) (quoting Haroco, Inc. v. Am. Nat’l \nBank & Trust Co., 747 F.2d 384, 401 (7th Cir. 1984)).   \n“An enterprise under RICO can include the usual legal entities such as partnerships and \ncorporations, but it also can include ‘any union or group of individuals associated in fact although \nnot a legal entity . . . .’”  Bradley, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 651 (quoting Manax v. McNamara, 842 F.2d \n808,  811  (5th  Cir.  1988)).    The  Supreme  Court  has  indicated  that  “enterprise”  should  be \ninterpreted broadly.  See Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 943–45 (2009) (noting that the \n“very concept of an association in fact is expansive”).  Here, the Plaintiffs argue that there are two \nassociation in fact type enterprises, both of which Signal is a member.  (Doc. No. 1, pp. 35–38.)  \nTo establish such an enterprise, the Plaintiffs must show evidence of “an ongoing organization, \nformal or informal, and evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.”  \nBoyle, 556 U.S. at 944. \nIn addition, for claims under § 1962(c), courts also require that the RICO person and RICO \nenterprise be distinct.  St. Paul Mercury Ins., 224 F.3d at 447  (“[S]ubsection (c) requires that the \nRICO person be distinct from the RICO enterprise.”).  This is where Signal argues that the \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 16 of 32 PageID #:  8740\nPlaintiffs’ claim is defective.  Signal insists that because “the Complaint alleges both that Signal \nis a RICO ‘person’ and that Signal was a ‘member’ of all RICO enterprises,” the Plaintiffs have \nfailed to allege an enterprise that is separate and distinct from Signal itself.  (Doc. No. 165, p. 31.)   \nSignal’s argument is misplaced.  First, Signal is simply incorrect when it asserts that the \nPlaintiffs are alleging that “Signal enterprised with itself.”  (Doc. No. 200, p. 5.)  The Plaintiffs \nhave alleged that Signal is a member of an enterprise; they have not alleged that the entire \nenterprise consists only of Signal and its officers, directors, or employees.  Compare Atkinson v. \nAnadarko Bank & Trust Co., 808 F.2d 438, 440 (5th Cir. 1987) (holding that “Anadarko Bank, \nAnadarko Bankshares, and [] three employees” were not an association in fact enterprise separate \nand distinct from Andarko Bank because there was no evidence that these entities “were associated \nin any manner apart from the activities of the bank”). \nSecond, Signal misconstrues the relevant case law.  The cases cited by Signal do not stand \nfor the proposition that the Plaintiffs’ RICO claim is defective as a matter of law merely because a \ncorporation is named as a person and a part of a RICO enterprise.  Rather, these cases hold that the \ndistinctiveness element was not satisfied based on the facts.  For example, in  Bradley, the \nplaintiffs alleged that the enterprise consisted of a group of companies.  Bradley, 527 F. Supp. 2d \nat 651.  The court found that there was nothing in the plaintiffs’ complaint “to suggest that the \nenterprise existed for any reason other than to commit the alleged predicate acts.”  Id.  Moreover, \nthe court found that “even if [the plaintiffs] had adequately pled an enterprise, they have failed to \nplead that any Defendants were ‘employed by or associated with [the] enterprise’ as required \nunder  § 1962(c).”    Id.  at  651–52.   Signal  has  not  pointed  to  anything  in  the  record  that \ndemonstrates, as a matter of fact, that the alleged enterprises are not distinct from the various \nmembers.  Accordingly, Signal has not met its burden for summary judgment.   \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 17 of 32 PageID #:  8741\nMoreover, Bradley did not hold that a corporation could not—as a matter of law—be \nnamed as part of an enterprise.  What Signal appears to be alluding to is a line of cases holding \nthat when a corporation is named as a RICO person, and that same corporation is named as the \nenterprise, the distinctiveness requirement may not be satisfied.  See Atkinson, 808 F.2d at 440; \nsee also Heden v. Hill, 937 F. Supp. 1230, 1242 (S.D. Tex. 1996) (“When the alleged Section \n1962(c) violator is a legal entity, such as a corporation, this required separation is not established \nby  merely  showing  that  the  corporation,  through  its  employees,  officers,  and/or  directors, \ncommitted a pattern of predicate acts in the conduct of its own business.”).  As the Second Circuit \nnoted, alleging a corporation as a member of an enterprise “does not foreclose the possibility of a \ncorporate entity being held liable as a defendant under Section 1962(c) where it associates with \nothers to form an enterprise that is sufficiently distinct from itself.”  See Riverwoods Chappaqua \nCorp. v. Marine Midland Bank, N.A., 30 F. 3d 339, 344 (2d Cir. 1994).  In other words, groups of \ncorporations  can  form  an  association  in  fact  type  enterprise,  but  a  party  cannot  avoid  the \ndistinctiveness requirement by “alleging a RICO enterprise that consists merely of a corporation \ndefendant associated with its own employees or agents carrying on the regular affairs of the \ndefendants.”  Isystems v. Spark Networks, Ltd., No. 10-10905, 2012 WL 3101672, at *5 (5th Cir. \nMarch 21, 2012) (per curiam) (quoting Khurana v. Innovative Health Care Sys., 130 F.3d 143, \n155) (5th Cir. 1997)); see also Atlas Pile Driving Co. v. DiCon Fin. Co., 886 F.2d 986, 995 (8th \nCir.  1989)  (upholding  allegations  of  an  enterprise  that  consisted  of  multiple  corporations).  \nBecause the Plaintiffs have alleged a larger enterprise than just Signal, the Plaintiffs’ claim is not \nstructurally defective as a matter of law.7  (See also Doc. No. 2115, David v. Signal Int’l, L.L.C., \n                                                   \n7.  Some commentators have argued that based on principles of statutory interpretation, a corporation cannot \nbe part of an association in fact RICO enterprise.  See, e.g., Randy D. Gordon, “Of Gangs and Gaggles: Can a \nCorporation be part of an Association-in-Fact RICO Enterprise? Linguistic, Historical, and Rhetorical Perspectives, \n16 U. PA. J. BUS. L. 973, 998–1008 (2014).  According to Mr. Gordon, circuit courts have erred by allowing plaintiffs \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 18 of 32 PageID #:  8742\n2:08-cv-1220 (E.D. La. Jan. 9, 2014) (finding that nearly identical RICO enterprises, which \nincluded Signal as a member, did not violate the distinctiveness requirement)). \nAccordingly, because Signal does not cite to anything in the record demonstrating that the \nalleged members did not form an enterprise, and because merely pleading that Signal is a member \nof an enterprise is not fatal to the Plaintiffs’ RICO claims, Signal is not entitled to summary \njudgment.  Of course, at trial, the Plaintiffs will need to prove all of the elements of a RICO \nenterprise.  See, e.g., Boyle, 556 U.S. at 944 (noting that an association in fact enterprise is \n“proved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and evidence that the various \nassociates function as a continuing unit”).   \nb.  Extraterritorial application of RICO \nSignal next argues that RICO does not apply extraterritorially.  (Doc. No. 165, pp. 32–34.)  \nSpecifically, Signal argues that “the civil RICO claim should be dismissed pro tanto,8 based on \nthe theory’s often unlawful, extraterritorial nature with regard to (1) mail and wire fraud; (2) \ntrafficking; and (3) unlawful document related practices under § 1592.”  (Id. at p. 37.)  The \nPlaintiffs have abandoned their claim under § 1592. \n                                                                                                                                                                    \n“to allege association-in-fact enterprises that include (and in many cases consist only of) corporations or other legal \nentities.”  Id. at 1028; see also Caroline N. Mitchell, et al., “Returning RICO to Racketeers: Corporations Cannot \nConstitute an Associated-in-Fact Enterprise Under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4), 13 FORDHAM J. COPR. & FIN. L. 1 (2008) \n(calling for a return to the “plain meaning” of RICO and arguing that based on questions asked at oral argument during \nMohawk Indus., Inc. v. Williams, 547 U.S. 516 (2006), many of the justices showed a concern about interpreting RICO \nso broadly).  While these commentators raise interesting points, until the Supreme Court revisits Boyle, which \ninstructed courts to interpret “enterprise” broadly, or the Fifth Circuit dictates otherwise, the undersigned is obligated \nto follow precedent.  See, e.g, United States v. Thevis, 665 F.2d 616, 625 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982) (affirming a RICO \nconviction when the enterprise consisted of both individuals and corporations).  Moreover, Signal has not raised the \nissues that these commentators were discussing.  Rather, Signal’s argument is based on the faulty premise that the \nPlaintiffs alleged that Signal has been named as the enterprise, as opposed to just a member of a larger enterprise. \n \n8. Pro tanto is defined as: “To that extent; for so much; as far as it goes.”  Black’s Law Dictionary, p. 1259 \n(8th ed. 2004).  The undersigned understands this to mean that to the extent that the Plaintiffs have plead a civil RICO \ncause of action based on the predicate acts of mail and wire fraud, trafficking, and unlawful document production, the \nPlaintiffs’ claim fails.  The Plaintiffs, however, also pled the predicate act of forced labor, and Signal did not move for \nsummary judgment on that claim.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 19 of 32 PageID #:  8743\nSignal argues as follows: RICO does not apply to conduct outside the United States, most \nof the alleged actionable conduct occurred abroad, therefore, the Plaintiffs’ RICO claim fails.  (Id. \nat p. 32.)  Signal’s analysis is overly simplistic.  While Signal is correct that numerous courts \nhave held that RICO does not apply extraterritorially, that does not end the inquiry.  See, e.g., \nMitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd. v. Seamaster Logistics, Inc., 871 F. Supp. 933, 937–38 (N.D. Cal. 2012) \n(“[C]ourts have uniformly held that RICO is silent as to its extraterritorial application and that, \nunder Morrison, it therefore has none.”).  The real issue is whether applying RICO to these set of \nfacts requires an extraterritorial application.  In other words, if this were a case involving only \nforeign conduct, RICO would not apply.  But that is not the case here.  The facts of this case are \npartly foreign and partly domestic.  \nThe Ninth Circuit, in United States v. Xu, 706 F.3d 965, 974–78 (9th Cir. 2013), which \ninvolved a scheme that had both foreign and domestic ties, undertook a comprehensive analysis of \nwhat conduct RICO reaches in light of Morrison.  The defendants in Xu were charged under \nRICO for a “scheme to steal funds from the Bank of China.”  Id. at 972.  They argued, however, \nthat the entire conspiracy took place overseas, thus they could not be charged.  Id. at 974–75.  \nThe conspiracy consisted of two parts: first, “a criminal enterprise that involved . . . embezzlement \nagainst the Bank of China that occurred in China and Hong Kong,” and second, “immigration \nfraud to escape to the to the United States with [the] ill-gotten gains.”  Id. at 975.   \nThe court in Xu started with the presumption that RICO does not apply extraterritorially.  \nId. at 974–75.  The court then examined whether “under the circumstances . . . RICO can be \nlawfully applied to any, or all, of Defendants’ conduct—foreign or domestic.”  Id. at 975.  The \ncourt noted, “Morrison frames the extraterritorial inquiry in terms of the focus of congressional \nconcern in enacting the statute,” and while “RICO’s focus is far from clear-cut,” two general \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 20 of 32 PageID #:  8744\napproaches have evolved.  Id.  “One camp asserts that RICO’s focus is on the enterprise,” while \n“the other camp asserts that RICO’s focus is on the pattern of racketeering activity.”  Id.  In \naddition, after the Ninth Circuit issued Xu, the Second Circuit articulated yet another test, finding \nthat RICO applies extraterritorially to the extent that the underlying predicate offense applies \nextraterritorially.  European Cmty. v. RJR Nabisco, Inc., 764 F.3d 129, 136 (2d Cir. 2014) \n(“RICO applies extraterritorially if, and only if, liability could attach to extraterritorial conduct \nunder the relevant RICO predicate act.”).  The Fifth Circuit has yet to address which test to apply \nand courts are split.  See CGC Holding Co., L.L.C. v. Broad & Cassel, No. 13-1255, 2014 WL \n6872148, at *15–17 (10th Cir. Dec. 8, 2014) (noting that “[c]ourts have gone in two directions in \nidentifying the ‘focus’ of RICO”).  However, the undersigned need not guess at which test \napplies, since under any approach, Signal’s conduct is domestic in nature. \n  If the focus is on the pattern of racketeering, it is evident that there are sufficient ties to the \nUnited States to apply RICO to the instant case.  As discussed above, the conspiracy in Xu had \ntwo distinct parts.  Xu, 706 F.3d at 978.  The first part, which consisted of stealing money from \nthe Bank of China, had no domestic ties.  Id.  The second part, however, which consisted of \nentering the United States using fraudulent visas and passports in violation of United States \nimmigration  laws,  “bound  the  Defendants’  enterprise  to  the  territorial  United  States.”    Id.  \nTherefore, the court found that because the goal of the enterprise involved a violation of United \nStates immigration law, “the dual parts of Defendants’ enterprise were necessarily conjoined in \npursuit of that goal—i.e., to steal large amounts of money from the Bank of China and get away \nwith it in the United States.”  Id. at 978–79.  The court held that the defendants could be liable \nunder RICO. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 21 of 32 PageID #:  8745\n  Here, while the actual recruitment of the Plaintiffs may have occurred abroad, it is \nundisputed that the goal was to bring them to the United States.  This nexus to the United States \nties “the Defendants’ enterprise to the territorial United States” and allows for RICO to attach.  \nFor example, had the Defendants recruited the Plaintiffs for work in Mexico, then it would be a \nstronger case the there was no domestic tie to trigger RICO under the pattern of racketeering test.  \nHowever, because the workers were recruited for work in the United States, and actually brought \nhere, this conduct is actionable under RICO. \n  Likewise, under the enterprise test, the undersigned finds that this is a domestic enterprise.  \nCourts applying this test consider “where the enterprise’s decisions are made, as opposed to \ncarried out, and thus centers on the ‘brains’ of an enterprise, not the ‘brawn.’”  Xu, 706 F.3d at \n976 (citing European Cmty. v. RJR Nabisco, Inc., No. 02-cv-5771, 2011 WL 843957, at *5–6 \n(E.D.N.Y. March 8, 2011) rev’d 764 F.3d 129).9  Courts have analogized this inquiry to the \n“nerve center” test enunciated in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010).  European Cmty., \n2011 WL 843957, at *6.  The enterprises alleged in this case consist mainly of domestic entities.  \nCompare In re Le-Nature’s, Inc., No. 0-1445, 2011 WL 2112533, at *3 (W.D. Pa. May 26, 2011) \n(“[T]he very title of the statute, ‘Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations,’ suggests an \nemphasis on the organization, or enterprise itself.  Consistent with this principle, it has been found \nthat RICO is inapplicable to a solely foreign enterprise.”) (citations omitted); Sorota v. Sosa, 842 \nF. Supp. 2d 1345, 1350 (S.D. Fla. 2012) (noting that the enterprise, which consisted of only \nPeruvian  individuals  and  companies,  was  a  foreign  enterprise).    Here,  the  majority  of  the \nDefendants are domestic entities, and only Defendants Sachin Dewan and Dewan Consultants are \n                                                   \n9.  The Second Circuit rejected this test in favor of defining RICO’s extraterritorial conduct in terms of the \nunderlying predicate acts.  European Cmty., 764 F.3d at 139 (“We think it far more reasonable to make the \nextraterritorial application of RICO coextensive  with the extraterritorial application  of the relevant predicate \nstatutes.”).  The enterprise test, however, has been applied outside of the Second Circuit, and therefore, it is still a \nviable approach.   \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 22 of 32 PageID #:  8746\nforeign.  Moreover, Signal cites no portion of the factual record in making this argument and \ntherefore, has not demonstrated that this is a foreign enterprise.  The Plaintiffs, however, attached \nevidence that tends to show that the enterprises were driven primarily by Signal.  (Doc. No. 187, \npp. 31–32) (citing evidence showing how “each of the Indian-based defendants received directives \nfrom the U.S-based members”).  Therefore, at the very least, there is a fact issue as to whether this \nwould be a domestic enterprise under this approach. \nIn addition, under the Second Circuit’s recently minted test, the undersigned finds that \nRICO  liability  can  attach  to  Signal’s  conduct.    The  Second  Circuit  considers  whether  the \npredicate act has an extraterritorial reach.  European Cmty., 764 F.3d at 139.   If it does, then \nRICO liability can attach.  Id.  The court also held that “[i]f domestic conduct satisfies every \nessential  element  to  prove  a  violation  of  a  United  States  statute  that  does  not  apply \nextraterritorially, that statute is violated even if some further conduct contributing to the violation \noccurred outside the United States.”  Id. at 142.  Here, the Plaintiffs rely on three predicate acts: \ntrafficking, mail fraud, and wire fraud.  As discussed above, the Plaintiffs’ trafficking claim is \ndomestic, therefore, RICO liability can attach.  As for mail and wire fraud, while these statutes do \nnot apply extraterritorially, the Plaintiffs have made sufficient allegations that Signal, along with \nthe other Defendants, used the United States mail and wire systems to further their scheme.  See \nid.  (noting that because “[t]he complaint alleges that defendants hatched schemes to defraud in \nthe United States, and that they used the U.S. mails and wires in furtherance of these schemes and \nwith the intent to do so,” the domestic conduct satisfied every element essential element, and \ntherefore, RICO liability could attach).  Furthermore, Signal has pointed to nothing in the record \nshowing that the alleged mail and wire fraud occurred only abroad.  (See also Doc. No. 2115, \nDavid v. Signal Int’l, L.L.C., 2:08-cv-1220 (E.D. La. Jan. 9, 2014)).    \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 23 of 32 PageID #:  8747\nTherefore, under any of the above approaches, Signal is not entitled to summary judgment \non the Plaintiffs’ RICO claims.   \nc.  Involuntary servitude/slavery \n  Signal also seeks “partial summary judgment on the claims alleging violations of 18 U.S.C. \n§§ 1583, 1584, and implicitly, the Thirteenth  Amendment.”   (Doc.  No. 165, p. 34.)   The \nPlaintiffs, however, have abandoned their reliance on these statutes, and have moved to dismiss \ntheir RICO claims based on these predicate acts.  Accordingly, the undersigned need not address \nSignal’s arguments as to these claims.  \nd.  Conspiracy \nSignal argues that the Plaintiffs’ claim under §1962(d) should be dismissed because \n“Plaintiffs lack the evidence required to establish the scienter § 1962(d) requires under countless \nfederal  authorities.”    (Doc.  No.  165,  p.  38.)    According  to  Signal,  “missing  is  proof  that \ncognitively, Signal subjectively entertained the required mens rea to defraud, i.e., knew at the time \nthat statements concerning green cards, in that context, were fraudulent statements . . . .”  (Doc. \nNo. 200, p. 8.)    \n  “In  order  to  demonstrate  a  RICO  conspiracy  under  §1962(d),  [the  Plaintiffs]  must \ndemonstrate ‘(1) that two or more people agreed to commit a substantive RICO offense and (2) \nthat [the defendant] knew of and agreed to the overall object of the RICO offense.’”  Chaney v. \nDreyfus Serv. Corp., 595 F.3d 219, 239 (5th Cir. 2010) (quoting United States v. Sharpe, 193 F.3d \n825, 869 (5th Cir. 1999)).  “A conspirator must at least know of the conspiracy and ‘adopt the \ngoal of furthering or facilitating the criminal endeavor.’”  Id. (quoting Salinas v. United States, \n522 U.S. 52, 65 (1997)). \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 24 of 32 PageID #:  8748\n  Signal is not entitled to summary judgment on the Plaintiffs’ § 1962(d) claim for two \nreasons.  First, Signal has not carried its burden.  Signal merely offers the conclusion that the \nPlaintiffs have no evidence that Signal had the requisite intent to defraud and does not cite to any \nportion of the record in making this argument.  “It is not enough for the moving party to merely \nmake a conclusory statement that the other party has no evidence to prove his case.”  See Celotex \nCorp., 477 U.S. at 328 (White, J. concurring); see also Ash v. Corley, 992 F.2d 540, 543 (5th Cir. \n1993) (“Before the non-moving party is required to produce evidence in opposition to [a motion \nfor summary judgment], the moving party must first satisfy its obligation of demonstrating that \nthere are no factual issues warranting trial.”) (citation omitted).  While Signal does not have to \n“negate the elements of the nonmovant’s case,” Signal must offer more than the mere assertion \nthat the Plaintiffs cannot prove their case.  See Little, 37 F.3d at 1075; see also Seastrunk v. \nDarwell Integrated Tech., No. 3:05-cv-0531, 2008 WL 190316, at *2–3 (N.D. Tex. Jan. 22, 2008) \n(“The moving party, while not needing to produce evidence, must at least identify portions of the \nrecord that demonstrate an absence of evidence.”).       \n  Second, despite Signal not meeting its burden, the Plaintiffs put forth enough evidence to \ndemonstrate the existence of a genuine dispute of material fact.  The Plaintiffs offer, amongst \nother evidence, the deposition of Sachin Dewan, who testified that Signal knew he had made false \npromises of permanent residency.  (Doc. No. 187, Ex. 36.)  This evidence creates a triable issue \nas to whether Signal knew of the false promises, yet participated in the conspiracy by continuing to \nuse Dewan to recruit the Plaintiffs and facilitate the illicit scheme.  See Provident Life & Acc. Ins. \nCo. v. Goel, 274 F.3d 984, 991 (5th Cir. 2001) (“Credibility determinations, the weighing of \nevidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are the jury functions, not those \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 25 of 32 PageID #:  8749\nof a judge . . . .The evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are \nto be drawn in his favor.”) (citations omitted).  \n  In sum, in light of the Plaintiffs’ evidence, there is a fact issue as to what Signal knew, \nwhen Signal knew it, and Signal’s level of participation in the overall scheme.  Accordingly, \nsummary judgment on the Plaintiffs’ conspiracy claim is not warranted.  \nC.  Claim Four: Violations of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)) \nIn the Plaintiffs’ fourth claim for relief, they seek damages under 42 U.S.C. §1985(3) \nclaiming  that  “Defendants  conspired,  agreed,  planned  and  coordinated  for  the  purpose  of \ndepriving Plaintiffs of equal protection of their rights under the Thirteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution and its implementing and enforcing statutes (inter alia, 18 U.S.C. \n§§1589, 1590) to be free from forced labor, involuntary servitude, and trafficking in persons.”  \n(Doc. No. 1, p. 45.)  The Plaintiffs’ complaint lists three separate and distinct acts that allegedly \nviolate § 1985(3): involuntary servitude, forced labor, and trafficking.  (Id.)  Unlike their claims \nunder the TVPRA and RICO, the Plaintiffs did not abandon their claim of involuntary servitude as \nto their §1985(3) cause of action.  Signal moves for summary judgment on two grounds.  First, \nSignal claims that the evidence negates the Plaintiffs’ claim.  (Doc. No. 165, p. 39) (“[T]here is no \ngenuine issue of material fact concerning the truth that the plaintiffs knew that they were free to \nleave Signal whenever they wanted, even if leaving was in some sense painful . . . .”).  Second, \nthat §§ 1589 and 1590 are not actionable under §1985(3).   \na.  Definition of involuntary servitude under §1985(3) \nSection 1985(3) states:  \nIf two or more persons in any State or Territory conspire . . . for the purpose of \ndepriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal \nprotection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws . . . the \nparty so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damages.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 26 of 32 PageID #:  8750\n \n42 U.S.C. § 1985(3).  The Supreme Court has recognized only two rights protected by this statute: \nthe right to interstate travel and the right to be free from involuntary servitude.  See Bray v. \nAlexandria Women’s Health Clinic, 506 U.S. 263, 278 (1993). \n  At issue here is how broadly to interpret “involuntary servitude” under §1985(3).  Signal \nargues that the definition, as stated in United States v. Kozminski, 487 U.S. 931 (1988), is \ncontrolling.  (Doc. No. 165, pp. 34–39.)  In Kozminski, two men were convicted under 18 U.S.C. \n§ 241, which “prohibits conspiracy to interfere with an individual’s Thirteenth Amendment right \nto be from ‘involuntary servitude,’” and 18 U.S.C. § 1584, which “makes it a crime [to] knowingly \nand willfully hold another person ‘to involuntary servitude.’”  Kozminski, 487 U.S. at 934.  The \nissue in Kozminzki was “the meaning of ‘involuntary servitude’” under these two statutes.  Id. at \n939.  The Court held that “involuntary servitude” was to be narrowly construed and limited to \n“the use or threat of physical restraint or physical injury, or by the use or threat of coercion through \nlaw or the legal process.”  Id. at 952.  The Court considered statutes implementing the Thirteenth \nAmendment, and found that Congress had not undertaken to broadly define involuntary servitude, \nand “that nothing in the history of the Slave Trade statute [the precursor to §1584] suggests that it \nwas intended to extend to conditions of servitude beyond those applied to slaves, i.e., physical or \nlegal coercion.”  Id. at 946–47.   \n  Congress, however, expressly repudiated Kozminski’s narrow definition of involuntary \nservitude with the passage of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000.  \nKiwanuka, 844 F. Supp. 2d at 115–16 (“Kozminski is not controlling, as Congress has specifically \naddressed the Kozminski decision and rejected it as too narrow.”).  This Act broadened the \ndefinition of involuntary servitude to “include cases in which persons are held in a condition of \nservitude through nonviolent coercion.”  See Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 27 of 32 PageID #:  8751\nof 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-386, 114 Stat. 1446, 1467 (codified at 22 U.S.C. § 7101).  Specifically, \ninvoluntary servitude is defined as “any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to \nbelieve that, if the person did not enter into or continue in such a condition, that person or another \nperson would suffer serious harm or physical restraint.”  22 U.S.C. § 7102(6) (emphasis added). \n  Here,  the  expanded  definition  of  “involuntary  servitude”  defeats  Signal’s  motion.10  \nSignal simply argues that because the Plaintiffs were physically free to leave, there can be no claim \nfor involuntary servitude.  (Doc. No. 165, p. 35) (“[T]he statement of Undisputed Facts above \ndemonstrates that the Plaintiffs recognized that they could have left Signal physically if they had \nchosen to.  Under Kozminski, the claims of slavery and involuntary servitude are therefore \ninsupportable.”).    However,  as  discussed  above,  after  2000,  involuntary  servitude  now \nencompasses  nonviolent  coercion  and  threats  of  serious  harm.    A  review  of  the  evidence \ndemonstrates that the Plaintiffs have put forth enough evidence to create a fact issue as to whether \nthey have satisfied the current definition of involuntary servitude.  For instance, each of the \nPlaintiffs testified that Signal threatened them with deportation.  (See Doc. No. 187, pp. 5–11.)  \nIn addition, most of the Plaintiffs claim that they had their passports taken and were threatened \nwith physical force.  (See id.)  One Plaintiff goes so far as to claim the camp was gated and he felt \nhe was kept under lock and key.  (Id., Ex. 10, 88:7-10) (“Q: Was there ever a time when you \nwanted to leave the camp that you were stopped from doing so? A: Yes, there was an incident like \nthat.”).  While the threats of deportation and confiscation of  passports may not have been \nactionable under Kozminkzi, it is these types of “nonviolent coercion” that Congress sought to \nreach with the passage of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000.  \nTherefore, the mere fact that the Plaintiffs were physically free to leave Signal’s facility does not \n                                                   \n10.  The civil remedy provision of the TVPRA did not extend to 18 U.S.C. § 1584—the crime of involuntary \nservitude—until 2008.  However, because § 1985(3) provides the remedy, not 18 U.S.C. § 1595, finding Signal liable \nfor damages for conspiracy to commit involuntary servitude would not be a retroactive application of § 1595. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 28 of 32 PageID #:  8752\nentitle Signal to judgment as a matter of law, and the Plaintiffs have come forward with enough \nevidence to create a fact issue as to whether they were victims of involuntary servitude. \nb.  §§1589 and 1590 are actionable under §1985(3) \nAt the outset, is unclear whether Signal is actually seeking dismissal of the Plaintiffs’ \nclaims under §1985(3) to the extent that they are relying on violations of §§ 1589 and 1590.  \n(Compare Doc. No. 165, p. 34) (seeking a pro tanto dismissal of certain portions of the Plaintiffs’ \nRICO claim).  The Plaintiffs’ claim for relief under §1985(3) is predicated on involuntary \nservitude, in addition to forced labor and trafficking.  As discussed above, Signal is not entitled to \nsummary judgment on the involuntary servitude prong of the Plaintiffs’ claim.  However, Signal \nstates in passing that dismissal is warranted because “§1985(3) in no way ‘derives . . . from \n§§ 1589 and 1590.’”  (Id. at p. 39) (quoting David v. Signal Int’l, L.L.C., No. 08-1220, 2012 WL \n10759668,  at  *36  (E.D.  La.  Jan.  4,  2012)).   The  undersigned,  however,  finds  that  privat e \nconspiracies to violate §§ 1589 or 1590, that are motivated by racial animus, are actionable under \n§ 1985(3).  Therefore, Signal is not entitled to summary judgment.  \n Section 1985(3) is not a source of rights, rather “the rights, privileges and immunities that \n§ 1985(3) vindicates must be found elsewhere . . . .”  United Broth. of Carpenters & Joiners of \nAm. v. Scott, 462 U.S. 825, 833 (1983).  One of the rights protected by this section is the right to \nbe free from involuntary servitude.  Therefore, if §§1589 and 1590 are statutes that enforce the \nThirteenth Amendment (as the Plaintiffs argue), then a conspiracy to violate these statutes should \nbe actionable under § 1985(3).  See, e.g., Wells v. Rhodes, 928 F. Supp. 2d 920, 930–31 (S.D. \nOhio 2013) (holding that “§ 1982 provides an adequate basis for a private conspiracy claim under \n§ 1985(3) . . . [because] § 1982 protects citizens against private infringements in their property \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 29 of 32 PageID #:  8753\nrights . . . [and] shares a close relationship with the Thirteenth Amendment, which the Supreme \nCourt has recognized as a source of rights for § 1985(3).”). \nCourts have found that § 1589 is “an exercise of Congressional power under Section Two \nof the Thirteenth Amendment.”11  John Roe I v. Bridgestone Corp., 492 F. Supp. 988, 1003 (S.D. \nInd. 2007); United States v. Toviave, 761 F.3d 623, 629 (6th Cir. 2014) (noting that § 1589 was \npassed to implement the Thirteenth Amendment); United States v. Garcia, No. 02-cr-1105-01, \n2003 WL 22938040,  at *2–3 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 2, 2003) (rejecting  a  claim  that §1589 was \nunconstitutional because Congress lacked power under the commerce clause, and holding that \n§1589 was a “proper exercise of Congress’s power under the Thirteenth Amendment”); see also 22 \nU.S.C. § 7101(b)(22) (“The right to be free from slavery and involuntary servitude is among those \ninalienable rights.  Acknowledging this fact, the United States outlawed slavery and involuntary \nservitude in 1865, recognizing them as evil institutions that must be abolished.  Current practices \nof sexual slavery and trafficking of women and children are similarly abhorrent to the principles \nupon which the United States was founded.”).  Moreover, Congress is afforded wide latitude to \nboth define modern forms of slavery and involuntary servitude, as well as to enact legislation to \ncombat these insidious institutions.  In discussing Congress’s power under § 2 of the Thirteenth \nAmendment, the Fifth Circuit recognized that:  \n[T]he Supreme Court held [in Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409 (1968)] \nthat the scope of Congress’s power was not limited to measures intended to end \nstructures of slavery in a literal or a formal sense.  Instead, the Supreme Court held \nthat Congress has the authority to enact legislation necessary to abolish “badges” \nand “incidents” of slavery, as well as the power to rationally determine what those \n“badges” and “incidents” are. \n \nUnited States v. Cannon, 750 F.3d 492, 499 (5th Cir. 2014) (holding that the Matthew Shepard and \nJames Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 was a valid exercise of Congressional power \n                                                   \n11.  But see H.R. Rep. No. 106-487, pt. 2, at 27 (2000) (noting that the “Constitutional Authority” for the act \nis “Article I, section 8, clause 4 of the Constitution”). \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 30 of 32 PageID #:  8754\nunder the Thirteenth Amendment).  Therefore, because § 1985(3) protects the right to be free \nfrom involuntary servitude, and §§ 1589 and 1590 define and outlaw modern day manifestations of \ninvoluntary  servitude  and  slavery,  it  follows  that  conspiracies  to  violate  these  statutes  are \nactionable under § 1985(3). \n  The only other case that has addressed this specific issue is David, which is not binding.  \nThe court in David found that “the [Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000], \nwhich sought to criminalize involuntary servitude based [on] other forms of coercion, did not \nchange the scope of the Thirteenth Amendment.”  David, 2012 WL 10759668, at *36.  The \nundersigned, however, respectfully disagrees with the David court’s reasoning in finding that a \nprivate conspiracy to violate §§ 1589 or 1590 is not actionable under § 1985(3).  First, the court in \nDavid found that extending the reach of § 1985(3) would lead to “every criminal statute that \ninvolves a victim [] potentially giv[ing] rise to a ‘right’” under § 1985(3).  Id. at *36 n. 50.  \nSection 1985(3), however, has been on the books for nearly one hundred and fifty years and only \ntwo rights have been recognized: interstate travel and involuntary servitude.  See, e.g., Great Am. \nFed. Savs. & Loan Ass’n v. Novotny, 442 U.S. 366, 378 (1979) (holding that the right to be free \nfrom workplace discrimination under Title VII was not actionable under § 1985(3)).  Moreover, \nfinding statutes that combat modern day involuntary servitude actionable under § 1985(3) does not \nexpand the rights protected by §1985, but merely clarifies the definition of involuntary servitude. \nSecond, the David court noted that interpreting § 1985(3) too broadly would “render it ‘a \ngeneral federal tort law’” which would be “contrary to the admonition that the Supreme Court has \nlong held since Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88, 91 (1971) . . . .”  Id. at *36 n. 50.  Griffin, \nhowever, held that a necessary element under § 1985(3) is that “there must be some racial, or \nperhaps  otherwise  class-based,  invidiously  discriminatory  animus  behind  the  conspirators’ \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 217   Filed 01/26/15   Page 31 of 32 PageID #:  8755\nactions.”  See Griffin, 403 U.S. at 102.  This requirement limits the reach of private conspiracies \nunder § 1985(3) and prevents it from becoming a federal tort law.  Accordingly, the undersigned \ndoes not share the David court’s concerns.   \nTherefore, the undersigned finds that Signal is not entitled to summary judgment on the \nPlaintiffs’ §1985(3) claim, regardless of whether it is predicated on involuntary servitude, forced \nlabor, or trafficking. \nIV. Recommendation \n  For the reasons stated above, the undersigned recommends that Signal’s “Motion for \nPartial Summary Judgment” (Doc. No. 165) be DENIED. \nV.

' \n  ' \nv.    '    1:13-CV-323 \n  ' \nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL L.L.C.,   ' \net al.  ' \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION DENYING THE BURNETT DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS (DOC. NO. 37) \n \nThis case is assigned to the Honorable Marcia A. Crone, United States District Judge, and \nis referred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge for all pretrial matters pursuant to a \nReferral Order.  (Doc. No. 5.)  Before the undersigned is a “Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)” filed by Malvern C. Burnett, the Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C., \nand Gulf Coast  Immigration  Law Center,  L.L.C  (hereinafter referred  to  interchangeably  as \n“Burnett” and “the Burnett Defendants”).  (Doc. No. 37.)  The undersigned has considered the \npending motion and the corresponding response (Doc. No. 43).  The Burnett Defendants’ motion \nshould be denied because the Plaintiffs have sufficiently stated a claim upon which relief can be \ngranted, and a motion for summary judgment is the proper vehicle to prove the Plaintiffs state law \nclaims are barred by the statute of limitations. \nI.  Background \nA.  Procedural Background \n  On March 7, 2008, twelve individuals who were allegedly trafficked into the United States \nfiled a putative class action against the Defendants in the Eastern District of Louisiana.  See \nDavid  v.  Signal  Int’l,  LLC,  Civ.  A.  No.  08-1220  (E.D.  La.).    That  Court  denied  class \n1 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 120   Filed 07/29/14   Page 2 of 15 PageID #:  2524\ncertification;1 and, as a result of this ruling, the Plaintiffs in the instant action filed suit in this \nDistrict, where they were allegedly subjected to deplorable working conditions at a Signal facility \nin Orange, Texas.  (Doc. No. 1.)  On May 21, 2013, the Plaintiffs filed a complaint in this court \nagainst the following Defendants: the Burnett Defendants, Signal International L.L.C., Signal \nInternational, Inc., Signal International Texas, G.P., Signal International Texas, L.P. (collectively \nreferred  to  as  “Signal”),  Michael  Pol,  Global  Resources,  Inc.,  Sachin  Dewan,  and  Dewan \nConsultants PVT. LTD. (a/k/a Medtech Consultants).  (Id.)  On September 10, 2013, the Burnett \nDefendants filed the instant motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6).  (Doc. No. 37.)   \nB.  Factual Background    \n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, approximately 590 men, including the Plaintiffs, \nwere allegedly trafficked into the United States through the federal government’s H-2B guest \nworker program to provide labor and services to the Signal Defendants.  (Doc. No. 1, p. 1.)  The \nPlaintiffs claim they were lured to work for Signal through the fraudulent promise of legal and \npermanent work-based immigration to the United States for themselves and their families.  (Id., p. \n2.)  Subsequently, after coming to the United States, the Plaintiffs were allegedly subjected to \nforced labor and other serious abuses at Signal’s facility in Orange, Texas.  (Id., p. 4.)    \n  The Burnett Defendants consist of Malvern C. Burnett and his two corporations: Gulf \nCoast Immigration Law Center, L.L.C. and the Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C.  The \nPlaintiffs accuse Burnett of conspiring with Signal and other Defendants to recruit Indian welders \nand pipefitters to fill anticipated H-2B guest worker jobs at Signal’s operations with false promises \nof permanent residency in the United States for the workers and their families.  (Id.)    \n                                         \n  1.  David v. Signal Int’l, LLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. Jan. \n3, 2012). \n2 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 120   Filed 07/29/14   Page 3 of 15 PageID #:  2525\nII.  Jurisdiction \n  The Plaintiffs seek recovery pursuant to several federal statutes.  For actions brought \nunder these statutory provisions, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon federal \nquestion jurisdiction.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1331; 29 U.S.C. § 216(b).  For the state law causes of \naction, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon supplemental jurisdiction.  See \n28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).  Venue is proper because the events giving rise to the above claims occurred \nwithin the confines of this District.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1391. \nIII.  Rule 12(b)(6) Standard \nRule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes dismissal of a complaint \nthat fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  A Rule \n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss “is viewed with disfavor and is rarely granted.”  Harrington v. State \nFarm Fire & Cas. Co., 563 F.3d 141, 147 (5th Cir. 2009).  When a court analyzes a Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion, it “accepts ‘all well-pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light most favorable to the \nplaintiff.’”  In re Katrina Beaches Litig., 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Martin K. \nEby Constr. Co. v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit, 369 F.3d 464, 467 (5th Cir. 2004)).  A court should \ngrant such a motion only when the complaint fails to contain “enough facts to state a claim to relief \nthat is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim is \nplausible on its face “when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the \nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  “Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by \nmere conclusory statements, do not suffice.”  Id. \n \n \n3 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 120   Filed 07/29/14   Page 4 of 15 PageID #:  2526\nIV.  Analysis \n  The Plaintiffs allege Burnett violated the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization \nAct (“TVPA”), the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), and the Ku \nKlux Klan Act of 1871 (“KKA”).  (Doc. No. 1.)  The Plaintiffs have also asserted state law \nclaims of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract against Burnett.  (Id.)  First, \nBurnett argues the Plaintiffs have failed to provide sufficient facts to state any claim.  (Doc. No. \n37.)   Second,  Burnett  asserts  the  Plaintiffs’  state  law  claims  are  barred  by  the  statute  of \nlimitations.  (Id.) \nA.  Failure to State a Claim under Rule 12(b)(6) \n  1.  Insufficient Facts \n  Burnett generally argues the Plaintiffs failed to state more than mere conclusions and \nrecitals of statutory language without any basis in fact in their complaint.  In particular, Burnett \nargues that the Plaintiffs did not provide any facts showing Burnett engaged in illegal activity.  In \naddition, Burnett argues that each of the Plaintiffs’ federal claims “has as its linchpin” the false \nconcept “that threats of deportation satisfy the definition of involuntary servitude.”   (Doc. No. \n37, p. 2.) \n  First,  the  undersigned  finds,  contrary  to  Burnett’s  assertion,  that  the  Plaintiffs  have \nsufficiently alleged facts that allow the court to draw the reasonable inference that Burnett is liable \nfor the alleged misconduct.  In their complaint the Plaintiffs stated the following: \n  The Plaintiffs were trafficked into the United States through \nthe federal government’s H-2B guest worker program to provide \nlabor  and  services  to  Signal.    Recruited  to  perform  welding, \npipefitting, and other marine fabrication work, the Plaintiffs were \nsubjected  to  forced  labor  and  other  serious  abuses  at  Signal’s \noperations in Orange, Texas.  All of the Defendants, including \nBurnett, have exploited and defrauded the Plaintiffs by fraudulently \nrecruiting them to work in the United States and effectuating a broad \n4 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 120   Filed 07/29/14   Page 5 of 15 PageID #:  2527\nscheme  of  psychological  coercion,  threats  of  serious  harm  and \nphysical  restraint, and threatened abuse of the  legal  process  to \nmaintain control over the Plaintiffs.  \n  At all relevant times, the Burnett Defendants acted as agents \nof Signal for the purposes of recruiting, obtaining, contracting, and \ntransporting the Plaintiffs to provide labor services in the state of \nTexas.    Signal’s  direction  and  coordination  of  the  Recruiter \nDefendants’ and the Burnett Defendants’ recruitment efforts were \neffectuated by the use of numerous telephone, fax, e-mail, or mail \ncommunications that occurred from the spring of 2006 through at \nleast January 2007.  In these communications Signal authorized the \nRecruiter Defendants and the Burnett Defendants to act as their \nagents for the purposes of recruiting Indian welders and pipefitters \nto fill anticipated H-2B guest worker jobs at Signal’s Orange, Texas \noperations.  Signal further authorized the Recruiter Defendants and \nthe Burnett Defendants to represent that Signal would agree to \nsponsor bona fide green card applications for the Plaintiffs and \nobtain at least two H-2B visa extensions on behalf of Plaintiffs to \nallow them to remain in the United States working for Signal while \ntheir green card applications were being processed.  In exchange, \neach Plaintiff was required to pay fees totaling as much as 8 lakh \nrupees  ($20,000),  each  in  a  series  of  approximately  three \ninstallments.   \n  At informational meetings and in telephone conversations, \nfaxes, contracts, and other written documents transmitted through \nthe use of mail and wire communications occurring during the \nspring, summer and fall of 2006, the Recruiter Defendants and the \nBurnett  Defendants,  personally  or  through  their  agents, \nrepresentatives,  or  employees,  represented  to  the  Plaintiffs  that \nSignal  would  provide  lawful,  stable,  and  ample  employment \nopportunities;  working  under an H-2B visa for Signal  was not \ninconsistent  with  applying  for  permanent  immigration  status \nsponsored by Signal; and, Signal would obtain for the Plaintiffs \nwork-authorized green cards enabling  them to permanently and \nlegally reside in the United States with their families.  Burnett \nfurther promised to act diligently and to do everything necessary to \nensure that Plaintiffs would obtain green cards within 24 months of \ninitiating  the  green-card  process.    Finally,  Burnett  and  the \nRecruiter Defendants promised that the Plaintiffs would promptly \nreceive a refund of all or nearly all of their payments if these \nDefendants did not succeed in securing green cards for Plaintiffs, as \npromised.   \n  The Burnett Defendants and Recruiter Defendants induced \nthe Plaintiffs to enter the green card contracts even though they did \nnot  intend  to  pursue  diligently  the  Plaintiffs’  applications  and \nwithout any basis whatsoever for representing that: 1) Signal had \n5 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 120   Filed 07/29/14   Page 6 of 15 PageID #:  2528\nlawful  long-term  employment  opportunities  to  provide  the \nPlaintiffs; 2) Signal could legally apply for numerous H-2B visa \nextensions to maintain the Plaintiffs’ presence in the United States; \n3) working under an H-2B visa for Signal was not inconsistent with \napplying for permanent immigration status sponsored by Signal; 4)  \ngreen card applications sponsored by Signal would be valid and \nbona fide under U.S. immigration law; and 5) such applications \nwere likely to be successfully completed and approved within the \npromised  timelines.    Furthermore,  the  Burnett  Defendants  and \nRecruiter Defendants knew or should have known that they would \nnot refund Plaintiffs’ money as promised in the contracts and other \ndocuments.   \n  In late August and early September 2006, the United States \nCitizenship and Immigration Service (“USCIS”) approved Signal’s \nH-2B visa petitions for 590 H-2B workers for the period of October \n1, 2006 through July 31, 2007.  In approving these visa petitions, \nthe USCIS relied on the purported accuracy of the applicants’ stated \n10-month period of labor need and the representation that Signal’s \nneed  was  based  on  a  one  time  peak-load  temporary  demand.  \nSignal, the Burnett Defendants, and the Recruiter Defendants knew \nthat the stated period of need in Signal’s applications for labor \ncertifications and for H-2B visas were inconsistent with Signal’s \nprojected actual labor need; and, therefore the Defendants knew \nthese statements to the United States Government were false. \n  Lured by, and in reliance upon, the Defendants’ fraudulent \npromises of legal and permanent work-based immigration to the \nUnited  States  for  themselves  and  their  families,  the  Plaintiffs \nplunged themselves and their families into debt to take advantage of \nthese seemingly promising opportunities. The Plaintiffs incurred \nsignificant  debts  to  pay  mandatory  recruitment,  immigration \nprocessing,  and  travel  fees  charged  by  Defendants.    Upon  the \nPlaintiffs’ arrival in the United States, Signal  required that the \nPlaintiffs live in a guarded, overcrowded, and isolated labor camp \nlocated  in  Orange,  Texas  (the  “Texas  Labor  Camp”).    The \nPlaintiffs had no choice but to use Recruiter Defendants and Burnett \nDefendants  to  secure  employment  at  Signal’s  operations.  \nManagement personnel at Signal made the conscious and deliberate \ndecision to prohibit Plaintiffs from securing employment at Signal’s \noperations  either  through  another  recruiter  or  by  bypassing \nrecruiters altogether and applying directly with Signal. \n  Signal,  through  its  employees  or  agents,  contacted  the \nRecruiter Defendants and the Burnett Defendants to express its \nconcerns  about  worker  organizing  efforts  and  the  specific \ninvolvement  of  the  Plaintiffs.    During  these  conversations  the \nRecruiter Defendants, the Burnett Defendants and Signal reached an \nagreement regarding steps to be taken to discourage further worker \n6 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 120   Filed 07/29/14   Page 7 of 15 PageID #:  2529\norganizing efforts and to ensure that the Indian H-2B Workers \ncontinued to work at Signal without complaint, as well as to prevent \nthe Indian H-2B Workers from exercising their legal rights.   \n  Since first contracting with Defendants in India and the \nUnited Arab Emirates, the Plaintiffs have yet to receive from the \nDefendants  the  promised  green  cards  or  permanent  residency. \nDespite clear contractual provisions requiring them to do so, the \nRecruiter Defendants and the Burnett Defendants have refused to \nrefund any of the fees Plaintiffs paid to them for unsuccessful green \ncard and visa processing. \n \n  The Plaintiffs have clearly alleged the Burnett Defendants were an “integral member of a \nlabor trafficking scheme designed to recruit the Plaintiffs for work at Signal based on false \npromises of permanent residency.”  (Doc. No. 43, p. 5.)  In their motion to dismiss, the Burnett \nDefendants argue that these facts are merely “occurrences and actions that are consistent with any \nattorney representing his or her clients.”  (Doc. No. 37, p. 3.)  However, the Plaintiffs have \nprovided  facts  describing  Burnett’s  acts  that  are  entirely  inconsistent  with  a  “normal” \nattorney-client relationship.  As stated above, Burnett allegedly made false promises to the \nPlaintiffs to lure them into working for Signal.  Burnett also required the Plaintiffs to pay him \nexorbitant fees for his services, and then refused to refund the Plaintiffs’ money when he failed to \nperform as promised.     \n  Furthermore, the Plaintiffs have provided sufficient facts to support their argument that \nBurnett  is  liable  for  fraud  and  negligent  misrepresentation.   Under  Federal  Rule  of  Civil \nProcedure 9(b), “a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or \nmistake.  Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person’s mind may be alleged \ngenerally.”  As detailed above, Burnett made several promises to the Plaintiffs that he allegedly \nknew to be untrue: 1) Signal had lawful long-term employment opportunities to provide Plaintiffs; \n2) Signal could legally apply for numerous H-2B visa extensions to maintain Plaintiffs’ presence \nin the United States; 3) working under an H-2B visa for Signal was not inconsistent with applying \n7 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 120   Filed 07/29/14   Page 8 of 15 PageID #:  2530\nfor permanent immigration status sponsored by Signal; 4) green card applications sponsored by \nSignal would be valid and bona fide under U.S. immigration law; 5) such applications were likely \nto be successfully completed and approved within the promised timelines; and 6) Burnett would \nrefund the Plaintiffs’ money if he failed to perform.  In reliance on Burnett’s promises, the \nPlaintiffs “plunged themselves and their families into debt,” and traveled to the United States to \nwork at Signal’s Orange, Texas facility.  (Doc. No. 1, p. 2.)  \n  The Plaintiffs have also provided sufficient facts alleging that Burnett conspired with \nSignal.  More than once, in their complaint and the RICO chart attached to the complaint as \nExhibit 1, the Plaintiffs allege that the Burnett Defendants worked with the Recruiter Defendants \nand  Signal  to  carry  out  this  scheme.    The  Plaintiffs  allege  there  are  letters  and  phone \nconversations showing the Defendants conspired to: 1) recruit the Plaintiffs with false promises of \npermanent residency for themselves and their families; and 2) keep the Plaintiffs from protesting \ntheir mistreatment and leaving Signal’s employ.   \n  Finally, Burnett generally states the Plaintiffs failed to allege facts to support their breach \nof contract claim.  (Doc. No. 37, p. 5.)  However, the Plaintiffs allege they entered into contracts \nwith Burnett under which they would pay fees to Burnett in exchange for his promise to provide \nthem with lawful employment and work-authorized green cards enabling them to permanently and \nlegally reside in the United States with their families.  (Doc. No. 1, p. 17.)  Burnett allegedly \nbreached this contract by not fulfilling those promises and refusing to refund the fees the Plaintiffs \npaid him.  (Id.)  \n  2.  Involuntary Servitude \n  The Burnett Defendants also argue that “each of the federal causes of action has as its \nlinchpin the concept that threats of deportation satisfies the definition of involuntary servitude,” \n8 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 120   Filed 07/29/14   Page 9 of 15 PageID #:  2531\nand “as a matter of law, the threat of deportation does not satisfy a determination of involuntary \nservitude.”  (Doc. No. 37, p. 2.)  The Burnett Defendants do not elaborate on how each of the \nPlaintiffs’ claims is based on the premise that threats of deportation satisfy the definition of \ninvoluntary servitude.   \n  Nonetheless, the case cited by Burnett in support of his assertion is easily distinguished \nfrom the instant case.  In Zavala v. Wal Mart Stores, the plaintiffs were “seeking compensation \nfor unpaid overtime and certification of a collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Act \n(FLSA), civil damages under RICO, and damages for false imprisonment.”  Zavala v. Wal Mart \nStores Inc., 691 F.3d 527, 530 (3d Cir. 2012).  The plaintiffs supported their RICO and false \nimprisonment claims on the theory that the defendants forced them into working by threatening to \nreport their immigration status to the authorities.  Id. at 533.  The Court stated that “absent some \nspecial circumstances, threats of deportation are insufficient to constitute involuntary servitude.”  \nId. at 541.  However, unlike the instant case, in Zavala, Wal-Mart did not contract directly with \nthe plaintiffs; the plaintiffs did not work exclusively for Wal-Mart and “often switched jobs, freely \nmoving to different employers in different cities;” and the plaintiffs were not housed in labor \ncamps.  Id.  In fact, the Zavala court asserted that “[m]odern day examples of involuntary \nservitude have been limited to labor camps, isolated religious sects, or forced confinement.”  Id. \nat 540.  In the instant case, the Plaintiffs allege they were housed in a guarded, overcrowded and \nisolated “labor camp, which other employees and management at Signal referred to as the \nreservation.”  (Doc. No. 1, p. 4, 27.)  The “labor camp” was allegedly surrounded by barbed-wire \nfences and was located in an isolated industrial area miles removed from shopping, places of \nworship, public transportation or residential communities.  (Doc. No. 1, p. 25.)    \n  Furthermore,  the  Supreme  Court  held  in  United  States  v.  Kozminski  that  “the \n9 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 120   Filed 07/29/14   Page 10 of 15 PageID #:  2532\nvulnerabilities of the victim are relevant in determining whether the physical or legal coercion or \nthreats thereof could plausibly have compelled the victim to serve” involuntarily.  United States \nv. Kozminski, 487 U.S. 931, 952 (1988).  The Court further held that “a trial court could properly \nfind that evidence of . . . extremely poor working conditions is relevant to corroborate disputed \nevidence regarding the use or threatened use of physical or legal coercion . . . .”  Id.  Therefore, a \ncourt must consider all of the relevant circumstances when determining whether the Plaintiffs were \nforced to serve involuntarily.  In their complaint, the Plaintiffs allege the following: \n  The Texas Labor Camp gates were constantly monitored by \nsecurity  guards  retained  by  Signal.  Signal’s  security  guards \nmonitored the Plaintiffs’ comings and goings by requiring them to \nshow their employee identification badges and recording when the \nPlaintiffs entered and exited the camp.  Signal’s security guards \nalso searched the Plaintiffs’ packages and bags when they entered \nthe  camp.    Except  on  rare  occasions,  the  Plaintiffs  were  not \npermitted to receive visitors in the camp.   \n  Up to twenty-four men were housed in each bunkhouse and \nmade to sleep in two tiered bunk beds. The bunk beds were so \ntightly packed in the bunkhouses that it was difficult for workers to \nmove about in the narrow passageways between bunks or sit up in \nbed.  These housing conditions violated OSHA regulations.  The \nTexas Labor Camp bunkhouses had insufficient toilet and bathing \nfacilities for twenty-four men, one or two toilets per bunkhouse, \nresulting in long lines for the bathrooms before and after work shifts \nand unsanitary conditions due to unresolved plumbing problems \nthat  rendered  the  toilets  inoperable.    Signal’s  personnel  and \nsecurity guards conducted surprise searches of the dormitory areas \nof  the  bunkhouses,  including  searches  of  workers’  personal \nbelongings.  Upon information and belief, Signal did not obtain the \nrequired permit(s) to furnish board at the Texas Labor Camp, and \nthe condition and sanitation of the board provided further violated \nfederal, state, and/or local law.  When the Plaintiffs complained \nand asked to live outside the Texas Labor Camp, Signal initially \nrefused and subsequently told workers that if they tried to live \noutside the Texas Labor Camp, Signal would still deduct the labor \ncamp fees from the Plaintiffs’ wages. As a result, the Plaintiffs \nreasonably believed they had no choice but to continue living in \nSignal’s Texas Labor Camp. \n  Signal  only  housed  Indian  H-2B  Workers  such  as  the \nPlaintiffs  in  its  Labor  Camps,  which  other  employees  and \n10 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 120   Filed 07/29/14   Page 11 of 15 PageID #:  2533\nmanagement at Signal referred to as the “reservation(s).” Upon \ninformation and belief, United States citizens and other workers of \nnon-Indian descent and non-Indian race were neither required nor \nallowed to live in or pay for accommodations in Signal’s Texas \nLabor Camp.  Signal subjected the Plaintiffs to skills testing and \nre-testing, on-the-job discipline, layoffs, periods without work, lack \nof  safety  precautions,  unfavorable  job  assignments,  evaluation \nprocesses,  and  other  adverse  employment  actions  to  which \nnon-Indian and United States citizen workers were not similarly \nsubjected. \n  In the isolated and guarded atmosphere of the Texas Labor \nCamp and saddled with the crushing debts they had incurred to \ncome  to  the  United  States  in  reliance  upon  the  Defendants’ \nrepresentatives,  the  Plaintiffs  reasonably  believed  Signal’s \nstatements were threatening and believed they had no choice but to \ncontinue working for Signal despite deplorable working and living \nconditions.  \n  The  Plaintiffs  and  other  Indian  H-2B  Workers  became \nincreasingly  frightened  and  confused,  particularly  when  word \nspread that Signal had locked up the Mississippi Labor Camp Indian \nH-2B  Workers  who  complained  about  the  working  conditions.  \nSignal’s  actions  at  the  Mississippi  Labor  Camp  significantly \nintensified the reasonable fears of the Plaintiffs and other Indian \nH-2B Workers in the Texas Labor Camp that if they tried to leave \nSignal’s  employ  or  oppose  unlawful  and  coercive  employment \nconditions at Signal, including by consulting with counsel, they \nfaced the threat of physical restraint, detention, forced deportation, \nor other serious harm or abuses of the legal process. \n \n  In light of these allegations, the undersigned finds the Plaintiffs have stated a plausible \nclaim of involuntary servitude.  Accordingly, the undersigned recommends that the court deny the \nBurnet Defendants’ motion to dismiss on the basis that the Plaintiffs failed to state a plausible \nclaim. \n  B.  Statute of Limitations  \n  The Burnett Defendants also assert that the Plaintiffs’ pendent state law claims are time \nbarred by the statute of limitations.  Burnett argues the statute of limitations on the state law \nclaims began to run, at the latest, when the David case was filed on March 7, 2008.  Burnett \nsubmits that because the plaintiffs were putative class members in David, they were “necessarily \n11 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 120   Filed 07/29/14   Page 12 of 15 PageID #:  2534\naware of all the facts” that would trigger the running of the statute of limitations.  Although \nBurnett does not catalogue the statute of limitations for each pendent state law claim under Texas \nlaw, he claims they would expire, at the latest, in four years—2012.  The complaint in the instant \ncase was filed in 2013.  Burnett also argues the federal class action filed in the David court, which \nwas not certified, did not toll the running of the statute of limitations on the state law claims.  In \nresponse, the Plaintiffs argue the David Court explicitly tolled the statute of limitations on all of \nthe Plaintiffs’ state law claims.  (Doc. No. 43, p. 15.)  In the alternative, they argue Texas law \nsupports the tolling of the statute of limitations as to all purported members of a class upon the \nfiling of the class action.  (Id.)   \nThe David complaint was filed on March 7, 2008.  (Doc. No. 37, Exh. 2.)  United States \nDistrict Judge Zainey, upon the consent of Signal and the Burnett Defendants, entered an order \ntolling the statute of limitations for the absent class members’ (who are the Plaintiffs in this case) \nstate law claims for 120 days until after the court’s final ruling on class certification.  Order, \nKurian David et al. v. Signal International, L.L.C., et al., No. 2:08-cv-1220 (E.D. La. Jan. 20, \n2011) (Doc. No. 982).  Judge Zainey entered an order denying class certification on January 4, \n2012, making the expiration of the tolling period May 3, 2012.  Order and Reasons, David, No. \n2:08-cv-1220 (Doc. No. 1117).  The case was subsequently transferred to United States District \nJudge Susie Morgan.  Order Reassigning Case, David, No. 2:08-cv-1220 (Doc. No. 1157).  Over \nSignal’s objection, Judge Morgan further tolled the statute of limitations for the Plaintiffs’ claims \nuntil  August  28,  2013.    Order  and  Reasons,  David,  No.  2:08-cv-1220  (Doc.  No.  1379).  \nHowever, pursuant to Burnett’s request, Judge Morgan clarified that prior order by stating it only \ntolled the limitations period for the federal law claims, not any state law claims.  Order and \nReasons, David, No. 2:08-cv-1220 (Doc. No. 1417). \n12 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 120   Filed 07/29/14   Page 13 of 15 PageID #:  2535\nFor a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court is  typically not  to  look  beyond  the complaint.  \nHowever, a court may consider attachments to briefing regarding a motion to dismiss if the \ndocuments are referenced in the complaint, central to the complaint, referenced by the parties, and \ntheir authenticity is not in dispute.  See Walch v. Adjutant Gen. Dep’t, 533 F.3d 289, 293–94 (5th \nCir. 2008) (citing In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007)); Causey \nv. Sewell Cadillac-Chevrolet, Inc., 394 F.3d 285, 288 (5th Cir. 2004).  Those are the only \ndocuments the undersigned should consider in deciding the motion to dismiss as it concerns the \nlimitations issue—not the various court orders entered by the New Orleans district courts tolling \nstate statutes of limitations for the pendent state law claims.2   \nNevertheless, even if the undersigned were to consider and apply Judge Zainey’s tolling \norder from the date the David complaint was filed until its expiration, the undersigned would still \nneed to go outside the pleadings to intelligently determine the appropriate accrual date for the \nvarious state law claims and what effect the tolling period from Judge Zainey’s order has on the \ntimeliness of the pendent state law claims filed in the instant complaint.3  Pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 12(d), “if on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) matters outside the pleadings \nare presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary \njudgment under Rule 56, and all parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present material \nthat is pertinent to the motion.”  Accordingly, to the extent the Burnett Defendants believe the \nPlaintiffs’ state law claims are still barred by the statute of limitations in light of Judge Zainey’s \n                                         \n  2.  Burnett did not address the tolling orders entered by the David court, and the Plaintiffs only mentioned \nJudge Morgan’s initial order tolling the statute of limitations for the state law claims, not the order clarifying that the \nprevious order only applied to the federal law claims.  It should be noted that the briefing on the instant motion \noccurred before Judge Morgan’s order clarifying the previous order was entered. \n  \n  3.  Burnett cites Bell v. Showa Denko K.K., 899 S.W.2d 749 (Tex. App. 1995) in support of their argument  \nthat Texas courts hold the filing of a proposed federal class action does not toll the limitations period on pendent state \nlaw claims.  See also Newby v. Enron Corp., 542 F.3d 463 (5th Cir. 2008).  In those cases, it does not appear the \nDefendants consented to the tolling of the statute of limitations, as the Burnett Defendants did here, at least for the \nperiod of time reflected in Judge Zainey’s order.  As such, those cases appear to be inapposite. \n13 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 120   Filed 07/29/14   Page 14 of 15 PageID #:  2536\ntolling order, that is a matter best addressed in a motion for summary judgment, after the parties \nhave had an opportunity for full discovery and the court can consider evidence outside the \npleadings.       \nV.  Recommendation \n  For the reasons stated above, the Burnett Defendants’ “Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)” (Doc. No. 37) should be denied, subject to reconsideration in a motion for \nsummary judgment that the state law claims are barred by the statute of limitations. \nVI.  Objections \n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(c) (Supp. IV 2011), each party to this action has the right \nto file objections to this report and recommendation.  Objections to this report must (1) be in \nwriting, (2) specifically identify those findings or recommendations to which the party objects, and \n(3) be served and filed within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this report.  See \n28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(c); Fed R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2).  A party who objects to this report is entitled to \na de novo determination by the United States District Judge of those proposed findings and \nrecommendations to which a specific objection is timely made.  See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(c); \nFed R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3).   \n  A party’s failure to file specific, written objections to the proposed findings of fact and \nconclusions of law contained in this report, within fourteen (14) days of being served with a copy \nof this report, bars that party from: (1) entitlement to de novo review by the United States District \nJudge of the findings of fact and conclusions of law, see Rodriguez v. Bowen, 857 F.2d 275, 276–\n77 (5th Cir. 1988), and (2) appellate review, except on grounds of plain error, of any such findings  \n \n14 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 120   Filed 07/29/14   Page 15 of 15 PageID #:  2537\nof fact and conclusions of law accepted by the United States District Judge, see Douglass v.

' \n \nORDER SEVERING AND TRANSFERRING SIGNAL’S CROSS-CLAIMS  \nTO THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \n \nThis case is assigned to the Honorable Marcia Crone, United States District Judge, and is \nreferred to the undersigned United States magistrate judge for all pretrial matters.  (Doc. No. 5.)  \nPending before the undersigned is the “Motion to Defer Signal’s Cross Claim[s] or in the \nAlternative to Transfer Venue of Signal’s Cross Claim[s] Pursuant to the First-Filed Rule” (Doc. \nNo. 195) filed by Defendants Malvern C. Burnett, Malvern C. Burnett A.P.C., and the Gulf Coast \nImmigration Center, L.L.C. (collectively, “Burnett”).  The certificate of conference states that \n“Signal has no objection to the filing of the motion, but has not determined, as yet, its position on \nthe merits of the motion itself . . . .” (Id. at p. 13.)  It was not indicated whether any other party \nopposed the motion.  However, the time for responding to Burnett’s motion has passed and no \nobjections were filed.  Accordingly, the undersigned considers the motion unopposed.  See \nLocal Rule CV-7(d) (“In the event that a party fails to oppose a motion in the manner prescribed \nherein, the court will assume that the party has no objection.”).  After reviewing Burnett’s motion \nand the applicable authorities, the undersigned finds that Burnett’s motion should be granted in \npart and that Signal’s cross-claims should be severed from the main action and transferred to the \nEastern District of Louisiana.   \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 211   Filed 12/08/14   Page 2 of 6 PageID #:  8670\nI. Background \nOn March 7, 2008, a putative class action was filed in the Eastern District of Louisiana on \nbehalf of over five hundred plaintiffs who were allegedly victims of human trafficking.  (See Doc. \nNo. 1, David v. Signal Int’l, L.L.C., No. 2:08-1220 (E.D. La. March 7, 2008)).  The court in \nDavid denied class certification (as to all claims except the plaintiffs’ FLSA claims), which caused \nthe putative class members to file suit in the district where their injuries allegedly occurred.  The \nPlaintiffs in this case filed suit in the Eastern District of Texas because they claim to have suffered \ntheir injuries at a Signal facility in Orange, Texas.  \nLike in David, the Plaintiffs in this case sued numerous defendants.  (See Doc. No. 1); \n(See also Doc. No. 1, David v. Signal Int’l, L.L.C., No. 2:08-1220 (E.D. La. March 7, 2008)) \n(naming twelve defendants).  For convenience, the Plaintiffs grouped the Defendants into three \ncategories: “Signal” (collectively, Signal International, L.L.C., Signal International Texas, G.P., \nSignal  International  Texas,  L.P.,  and  Signal  International,  Inc.),    “Recruiter  Defendants,” \n(collectively, Global Resources, Inc., Michael Pol, Dewan Consultants Pvt., Ltd., and Sachin \nDewan), and “Burnett” (collectively, Malvern C. Burnett, Malvern C. Burnett A.P.C., and the Gulf \nCoast Immigration Center, L.L.C).  Also common to both cases are cross-claims Signal filed \nagainst these defendants.  (Doc. No. 79, pp. 47–66.); (Doc. No. 60, David v. Signal, Int’l, L.L.C., \nNo. 2:08-1220 (E.D. La. May 9, 2008)).1  Signal filed its cross-claims in the David case in 2008, \nand filed its cross-claims in this case in 2014. \nII. Analysis \nBurnett moves, pursuant to the “first-to-file-rule,” to have this court “prophylactically \nrefuse[] to hear Signal’s Cross Claims.”  (Doc. No. 195, p. 9.)  Alternatively, Burnett requests \n                                                   \n1.  In this case, Signal claims that is has suspended its cross-claims against defendant Michael Pol (Doc. No. \n79, p. 48 n. 1), and in David, Signal’s claims against him have been dismissed.  (Doc. No. 1976, David v. Signal, Inl’t, \nL.L.C., No. 2:08-1220 (E.D. La. Dec. 5, 2014)). \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 211   Filed 12/08/14   Page 3 of 6 PageID #:  8671\nthat the undersigned transfer his claims to the Eastern District of Louisiana.  (Id.)  No party filed \nan opposition or response to Burnett’s motion, thus, it is considered unopposed.  See Local Rule \nCV-7(d) (“In the event that a party fails to oppose a motion in the manner prescribed herein, the \ncourt  will  assume  that  the  party  has  no  objection.”).    However,  despite  the  fact  that  the \nundersigned considers Burnett’s motion unopposed, the undersigned finds it prudent to consider \nthe merits of Burnett’s motion.       \n“Under the first-to-file rule, when related cases are pending before two federal courts, the \ncourt in which the case was last filed may refuse to hear it if the issues raised by the cases \nsubstantially overlap.”  Int’l Fid. Ins. Co. v. Sweet Little Mex. Corp., 665 F.3d 671, 677 (5th Cir. \n2011) (citation omitted).  “In such a case, the district court in which the later action was filed may \ndismiss, stay, or transfer the suit in order to avoid duplicative litigation and enforce the principle of \ncomity.”  Carter v. Dep’t of Veterans Affairs, 228 F. App’x 399, 402 (5th Cir. 2007) (per curiam).  \n“In deciding whether to apply the first-to-file rule, the Court must resolve two questions: (1) are \nthe two pending actions so duplicative or do they involve such substantially similar issues that one \ncourt should decide the subject matter of both actions, and if so, (2) which of the two courts should \ntake the case.”  Datamize, Inc. v. Fid. Brokerage Servs., LLC, 2:03-CV-321-DF, 2004 WL \n1683171, at *3 (E.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2004) (Folsom, J.) (citing Tex. Instruments v. Micron \nSemiconductor, 815 F. Supp. 994, 997 (E.D. Tex. 1993)).  “Only the first issue is for the \nsecond-filed court to decide, however, for in this circuit, ‘[o]nce the likelihood of a substantial \noverlap between the two suits ha[s] been demonstrated, it [is] no longer up to the [second filed \ncourt] to resolve the question of whether both should be allowed to proceed.’”  Nabors Drilling \nUSA, L.P. v. Markow, Walker, P.A., 451 F. Supp. 2d 843, 845 (S.D. Miss. 2006) (alteration in \noriginal) (quoting Cadle Co. v. Whataburger of Alice, Inc., 174 F.3d 599, 605–06 (5th Cir. 1999)). \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 211   Filed 12/08/14   Page 4 of 6 PageID #:  8672\nThe undersigned finds that the first prong of the first-to-file rule is satisfied here.  Signal’s \ncross-claims in David are not just similar or related to the ones in this case—they are virtually \nidentical.  White v. Peco Foods, Inc., 546 F. Supp. 2d 339, 342 (S.D. Miss. 2008) (“The \nfirst-to-file rule does not require that cases be identical, but merely that there is a substantial \noverlap in issues and parties.”).  First, the only difference in the parties between the two cases is \nthat Signal sued an additional three Defendants, the “Labor Broker Defendants,” in David who are \nnot parties to this action.2  Compare (Doc. No. 79) with (Doc. No. 60, David v. Signal, Int’l, \nL.L.C., No. 2:08-1220 (E.D. La. May 9, 2008)); see also Save Power Ltd. v. Syntek Fin. Corp., \n121 F.3d 947, 951 (5th Cir. 1997) (“Complete identity of parties is not required for dismissal or \ntransfer of a case filed subsequently to a substantially related action.”).  It is also worth noting that \nSignal’s cross-claims are in no way impacted by the difference in the make-up of the plaintiffs in \neach case.    \nSecond, Signal asserted nearly identical cross-claims in each case.  The only variation is \nthat Signal asserted a claim for tortious interference with contract in David that it did not include \nhere.  (See Doc. No. 195, p. 2.)  In addition, beyond just pleading the same causes of action \nagainst the same defendants, resolution of Signal’s cross-claims involves the same facts and raises \nthe same issues in both cases.  In contrast, the undersigned denied Signal’s and Burnett’s requests \nto transfer the Plaintiffs’ claims to the Eastern District of Louisiana in part because the Plaintiffs in \nthis case worked at a different facility than the plaintiffs in David, and therefore, the proof and \nfacts for the claims would differ between the two cases.  (Doc. Nos. 56, 110.)  This is not the case \nfor Signal’s cross-claims.  Accordingly, the undersigned finds that there is substantial overlap \nbetween Signal’s cross-claims in this case and those in David. \n                                                   \n2. Signal also filed a third-party claim against Zito Companies, L.L.C. that was dismissed.  (Doc. No. 391, \nDavid v. Signal, Int’l, L.L.C., No. 2:08-1220 (E.D. La. April 7, 2009)). \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 211   Filed 12/08/14   Page 5 of 6 PageID #:  8673\nTherefore, the proper course of action is to either transfer, stay, or dismiss Signal’s \ncross-claims.    Burnett  requests  that  this  court  stay  Signal’s  cross  claims  because  “simply \ndeclining to hear those Cross Claims herein would be the easiest procedural vehicle to allow \nSignal’s Cross Claims to proceed in the court in which they were first filed.”  (Doc. No. 195, p. 9.)  \nThe undersigned, however, perceives no benefit to merely staying these claims.  To do so would \nonly invite additional litigation on issue and/or claim preclusion after these claims are decided in \nDavid.  (Id. at p. 3) (“Whatever disposition may be reached in David on Signal’s Cross Claims \nagainst Burnett and the other Cross Claim  Defendants  will be res judicata herein.”).    The \nfirst-to-file rule was meant to promote efficiency, not create additional substantive issues.   \nIn the alternative, Burnett requests that the undersigned transfer Signal’s cross-claims to \nthe Eastern District of Louisiana.  Because this is the most efficient manner of resolving these \nclaims, the undersigned finds that this is the appropriate remedy.  However, in order to transfer \njust Signal’s cross-claims, as opposed the entire case (including the Plaintiffs’ claims), Signal’s \ncross-claims must first be severed from the main case.  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 21, a “trial court has broad discretion to sever issues to be tried before it.”  Brunet v. \nUnited Gas Pipeline Co., 15 F.3d 500, 505 (5th Cir. 1994) (citing FED. R. CIV. P. 21); see also \nUnited States v. O’Neil, 709 F.2d 361, 366 (5th Cir. 1983) (noting that under Rule 21 a district \ncourt properly severed a party’s counterclaims).  The undersigned has authority under Rule 21 to \nsever Signal’s cross-claims even though Burnett did not specifically request such relief.  See \nBrunet, 15 F.3d at 505; United States v. Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp., No. CIV.A 86-1094, 2004 \nWL 1335723, at *6 (E.D. Pa. June 15, 2004) (“Thus, while neither party has asked this Court to \nsever, Rule 21 permits a court to sever claims sua sponte.”).   \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 211   Filed 12/08/14   Page 6 of 6 PageID #:  8674\nIII. Conclusion \n  For the reasons discussed above, the undersigned GRANTS IN PART Burnett’s “Motion \nto Defer Signal’s Cross Claim or in the Alternative to Transfer Venue of Signal’s Cross Claim \nPursuant to the First-Filed Rule.” (Doc. No. 195.)  Accordingly, it is \n  ORDERED that the Clerk of Court is DIRECTED to sever from this action Signal’s \ncross-claims against cross-defendants Malvern C. Burnett, Sachin Dewan, Dewan Consultants \nPvt., Ltd., Global Resources, Inc. Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, L.L.C., Law Offices of \nMalvern C. Burnett, A.P.C. and Michael Pol; and it is further \n  ORDERED that Signal’s “Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to  Liability of \nDefendants Malvern C.

No. 177), and Signal’s reply (Doc. No. 197) are part of the severed case; and it is \nfurther   \n  ORDERED the Clerk of Court shall TRANSFER Signal’s cross-claims against Malvern \nC. Burnett, Sachin Dewan, Dewan Consultants Pvt., Ltd., Global Resources, Inc. Gulf Coast \nImmigration Law Center, L.L.C., Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C. and Michael Pol and \nthe motions listed in the preceding paragraph to the Clerk of the United States District Court for \nthe Eastern District of Louisiana.  \n \nSIGNED this 8th day of December, 2014.\n \n__________________________________________________\nZaacckk HHaawwtthhoorrnn\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n6 \n ",

' \n  ' \nv.    '   1:13-CV-323 \n  ' \nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL L.L.C., et al.  ' \n \n \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER ON SIGNAL’S MOTION TO COMPEL (DOC. NO. 122) \nAND PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR INTERIM PROTECTIVE ORDER  \nUNDER RULE 30(d)(3) (DOC. NO. 140) \n \nThis case is assigned to the Honorable Marcia Crone, United States District Judge, and is \nreferred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge for pretrial proceedings pursuant to a \nreferral order entered on May 22, 2013.  (Doc. No. 5.)  Pending before the undersigned is the \n“Signal Defendants’ Motion to Compel” (Doc. No. 122) filed by Signal International, L.L.C., \nSignal International, Inc., Signal International Texas, G.P., and Signal International Texas, L.P. \n(collectively, “Signal”), and the Plaintiffs’ “Motion for Interim Protective Order Under FED. R. \nCIV. P. 30(d)(3).”  (Doc. No. 140.)  \nBoth motions center on the resolution of one issue—to what extent does the in terrorem \neffect  preclude  discovery  into  the  Plaintiffs’  “immigration  status,  immigration  history, \nemployment history, and personal information.”  (Doc. No. 140, p. 1.)  \nSignal seeks to compel production of the “plaintiffs’ T or U visas, their applications for \nsuch visas and other similar evidence, including evidence as to the lives of the plaintiffs after \nSignal employment.”  (Doc. No. 122, p. 1–2.)  T and U visas are available to victims of human \ntrafficking or other “qualifying criminal activity” and allow those who qualify to stay in the \nUnited States for up to four years, and may even lead to permanent residence.  The Plaintiffs \nresist production on two grounds.  First, they claim that requiring production of immigration \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 149   Filed 10/15/14   Page 2 of 23 PageID #:  2969\nrelated documents might reveal their immigration status, which “would harass, embarrass, and \noppress  the  Samuel  Plaintiffs . . . and  otherwise  chill  legitimate  claims  against  such  illegal \nactivity.”  (Doc. No. 125, p. 1.)  This is also known as the in terrorem effect.  (Id. at p. 7–9.)  \nSecond,  in  its  objections  to  discovery  propounded  by  the  Plaintiffs,  Signal  claimed  that \ndocuments relating to events occurring after the Plaintiffs stopped working for Signal were \nirrelevant.    Therefore,  the  Plaintiffs  contend  that  Signal  cannot  now  seek  to  compel  the \nproduction of documents from this period.  (Id. at p. 6–7.)  In turn, the Plaintiffs request that a \nprotective order be entered preventing discovery into “immigration status, immigration history, \nemployment history, and personal information of the Samuel Plaintiffs or their families after the \nSamuel Plaintiffs’ employment with the Signal Defendants was terminated.”  (Id. at p. 10); (see \nalso Doc. No. 140, p. 1.)   \nAfter considering the parties’ briefing and applicable authorities, the undersigned grants \nin part and denies in part Signal’s motion.  Specifically, as to Signal’s request for the Plaintiffs’ \nT and U visas, given the nature and stage of this case, and the fact that the documents are both \nrelevant and discoverable, the undersigned finds that Signal’s need for the information regarding \nthe Plaintiffs’ visas outweighs any potential in terrorem effect.  Therefore, the undersigned \ngrants Signal’s motion as to the visas.  As for documents related to the Plaintiffs’ lives “after \nSignal employment,” Signal failed to identify with any specificity what it is seeking and why it \nneeds this information, and therefore, failed to meet its burden.  In addition, because Signal has \nresisted discovery of information from this period on the grounds that it is irrelevant, Signal \ncannot now claim that this information is discoverable.  Accordingly, Signal’s motion as it \nrelates to information about “the lives of the plaintiffs after Signal employment” is denied.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 149   Filed 10/15/14   Page 3 of 23 PageID #:  2970\nAs to the Plaintiffs’ requests to enter a protective order (Doc. Nos. 125 and 140), the \nundersigned finds that the Plaintiffs have failed to show good cause why discovery on certain \ntopics should be completely precluded.  The information that the Plaintiffs seek to protect is \nrelevant and discoverable.  However, should Signal seek discovery that is clearly irrelevant and \nsolely aimed at harassment, particularly extensive discovery regarding the Plaintiffs’ relatives \nand other third parties, the undersigned will at that time consider whether judicially imposed \nlimits are necessary.   \nI. Background \n1.  Factual Background \n  The Plaintiffs are seventeen Indian men who allege that they are victims of human \ntrafficking.  (Doc. No. 1, pp. 2, 6–9.)  The Plaintiffs assert that Signal, along with several other \ndefendants, lured them into this country with the false promise that if they adequately performed \nwork for Signal, that this could be a pathway to “legal and permanent work-based immigration to \nthe United States . . . .”  (Id. at 2.)  Based on these allegedly false promises and misleading \nstatements, the Plaintiffs paid significant sums of money to obtain work papers and visas to come \nto the United States.  (Id.)  Once here, the Plaintiffs claim to have found themselves in deplorable \nliving and working conditions, as well as subject to threats of “arrest, loss of immigration status \nand deportation, and . . . a campaign of psychological abuse, coercion, and fraud designed to \nrender Plaintiffs afraid, intimidated, and unable to leave Signal’s employ.”  (Id. at p. 4.)   \n2.  Procedural Background \nThis  case  has  its  origins  in  a  putative  class  action  filed  in  the  Eastern  District  of \nLouisiana.  (See Doc. No. 1, David v. Signal Int’l, L.L.C., 2:08-cv-01220 (E.D. La. March 7, \n2008)).  Class certification was denied, which caused the individual putative class members to \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 149   Filed 10/15/14   Page 4 of 23 PageID #:  2971\nfile suit in the districts where their injuries allegedly occurred.  (See Doc. No. 1117, David, 2:08-\ncv-01220 (E.D. La. Jan 4, 2012)).  Cases were filed in the Eastern District of Texas, the Eastern \nDistrict of Louisiana, and the Southern District of Mississippi.  The Mississippi cases were \nconsolidated and transferred to the Eastern District of Louisiana under the “first-to-file” rule.  \n(See Doc. No. 44, Achari v. Signal Int’l, L.L.C., No. 1:13-cv-222 (S.D. Miss. Oct. 18, 2013)).  In \naddition, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed suit in the Southern District of \nMississippi alleging multiple Title VII violations that was also transferred to the Eastern District \nof Louisiana.  (See Doc. No. 52, EEOC v. Signal Int’l, L.L.C., No. 1:11-cv-179 (S.D. Miss. Feb. \n29, 2012)).   \nAll of the cases in the Eastern District of Louisiana are pending in the same court, and \nthat court has severely limited discovery related to immigration status.  (Doc. No. 125, p. 5.);  \nsee also David v. Signal Int’l, L.L.C., 257 F.R.D. 114, 126 (E.D. La. 2009) (“[A]ny inquiry into \nplaintiffs’ current  immigration status,  current  residence and/or post-termination employment \nhistory  will  most  assuredly  strike  paralyzing  fear  in  the  plaintiffs  sufficient  to  chill  any \ninclination they may have had to prosecute their pending claims.”).  The Plaintiffs argue that \n“[t]o require disclosure in this case would not only conflict with other protective orders in the \nRelated Cases, it would also allow the Signal Defendants to circumvent those orders and obtain \ndiscovery other courts have excluded.”  (Doc. No. 125, p. 4–5.)  The undersigned is confident, \nhowever, that to the extent any order entered in this case conflicts with an order entered in a \nrelated case pending in the Eastern District of Louisiana, any impact can be ameliorated by \nproper limits on the dissemination and use of the information produced. \n \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 149   Filed 10/15/14   Page 5 of 23 PageID #:  2972\nIII. Legal Standard \n “Generally,  the  scope  of  discovery  is  broad  and  permits  the  discovery  of  ‘any \nnonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party’s claim or defense.’”  Crosby v. La. Health \nServ. & Indem. Co., 647 F.3d 258, 261 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting FED. R. CIV. P. 26(b)(1)).  “A \ndiscovery request is relevant when the request seeks admissible evidence or ‘is reasonably \ncalculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.’”  Id. (quoting Wiwa v. Royal Dutch \nPetroleum Co., 392 F.3d 812, 820 (5th Cir. 2004)).  Moreover, “a district court has broad \ndiscretion in all discovery matters, and such discretion will not be disturbed ordinarily unless \nthere are unusual circumstances showing a clear abuse.”  Beattie v. Madison Cnty. Sch. Dist., \n254 F.3d 595, 606 (5th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted). \n“On notice to other parties and all affected persons, a party may move for an order \ncompelling  . . . discovery.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 37(a)(1).  “The moving party bears the burden of \nshowing that the materials and information sought are relevant to the action or will lead to the \ndiscovery of admissible evidence.”  Marin v. Gilberg, Civ. A. No. V-07-62, 2009 WL 426061, at \n*2 (S.D. Tex. Feb. 19, 2009).  If the moving party meets its burden, “the burden then shifts to the \nparty  resisting  discovery  to  show why the discovery is  irrelevant,  overly  broad, or unduly \nburdensome or oppressive, and thus should not be permitted.”  Id.  \nIn addition, “to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or \nundue burden or expense,” a party may move for a protective order under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 26(c).  The party seeking a protective order bears the burden to show that good cause \nexists.  See In re Terra Int’l, Inc., 134 F.3d 302, 306 (5th Cir. 1998).  The Fifth Circuit has noted \nthat this requires showing “‘a particular and specific demonstration of fact as distinguished from \nstereotyped and conclusory statements.’”  Id. (quoting United States v. Garret, 571 F.2d 1323, \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 149   Filed 10/15/14   Page 6 of 23 PageID #:  2973\n1326 n. 3 (5th Cir. 1978)); compare Topo v. Dhir, 210 F.R.D. 76, 77–78 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) \n(rejecting the idea that “protective orders must be supported by concrete factual showings” and \nnoting that some courts only require “good cause”) (citations omitted).    \nIV. Analysis \n1.  Signal’s “Motion to Compel” (Doc. No. 122) \nSignal seeks to compel the production of the “plaintiffs’ T or U visas, their applications \nfor such visas and other similar evidence, including evidence as to the lives of the plaintiffs after \nSignal employment.”  (Doc. No. 122, p. 1–2.)  At a minimum, it appears that Signal is requesting \nthat the undersigned compel production of documents related to Requests for Production Nos. 7 \nand 8.1  (Doc. No. 122, Ex. A) (See also Doc. No. 125) (identifying four specific Requests for \nProduction at issue in Signal’s motion, including Requests Nos. 7 and 8).  These requests relate \nspecifically to the Plaintiffs’ T visas.2  It is unclear what Signal means by “evidence as to the \nlives of the plaintiffs after Signal employment,” because Signal failed to identify any particular \nRequest to Production to which it is seeking a response.  Thus, the information that Signal seeks \ncan  be  grouped  into  two  categories:  visa  related  documents  and  post-Signal  employment \ndocuments.  Each set will be addressed separately. \n \n                                                 \n1.  The requests are as follows:   \n \nRequest for Production No. 7: Complete copies of Plaintiff[’s] T Visa application.  This request includes copies of \nany supplemental application and any other correspondence provided by Plaintiff, or representative, to the US \ngovernment in any way to his T-Visa application. \n \nRequest for Production No. 8:  Complete copies of the results of Plaintiff[’s] T Visa application.  Plainitff[’s] \nresponse should include any document ever received from the US Government relating in any way to Plaintiff’s T \nvisa application, including, but not limited to, any final determination, as well as a copy of the visa issued, if any.  \n \n2.  Signal’s motion seeks to compel production of both T and U visas, but Signal did not specifically \nrequest the U visa in its Requests for Production.  (Doc. No. 122.)  The Plaintiffs, however, do not raise this as a \nreason not to produce the U visas.  Given the similarity of the T and U visas, the undersigned will consider \ncompelling production of both visas. \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 149   Filed 10/15/14   Page 7 of 23 PageID #:  2974\na.  Visa related documents  \ni.  Background on T and U visas \nT and U visas were created with the passage of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence \nPrevention Act (“VTVPA”).  See Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, \nPub. L. No. 106-386, §§ 107, 1513, 114 Stat. 1464, 1477–79, 1534–37.  The T visa is available \nto unauthorized immigrants who have been victims of human trafficking, whereas a U visa is \navailable to victims of “qualifying criminal activity.”  See 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.11 (T visa); 214.14 \n(U visa).  The Code of Federal Regulations contains a laundry list of “qualifying criminal \nactivity,” which includes such crimes as trafficking, involuntary servitude, and slave trade.  Id. \n§ 214.14(a)(9).   \nThe T and U visas share some important characteristics that are relevant to this case.  \nFirst, they are available not only to the victim, but also certain family members of the victim.  Id. \n§§ 214.11(o)  (T  visa);  214.14(f)  (U  visa).    Second,  both  require  cooperation  with  law \nenforcement.  To obtain a T visa, the victim must comply with any reasonable requests from a \nlaw enforcement agency for assistance in the investigation or prosecution of human trafficking.  \nId. § 214.11(h).  Similarly, to obtain a U visa, a victim must have been “helpful, is being helpful, \nor is  likely to  be helpful  to  a certifying agency  in  the investigation or prosecution of the \nqualifying criminal activity upon which his or her petition is based . . . .”  Id. § 214.14(b)(3).  \nThird, each visa is valid for four years, and after a period of three years, the victim may seek \npermanent residence.  Id. §§ 245.23(a) (T visa); 241.14(g) (U visa).  Lastly, each visa authorizes \nthe victim to lawfully obtain employment.  Id. §§ 214.11(l) (T visa); 214.14(i)(7) (U visa).        \nii.  Signal has met its burden \nAs the movant, it is Signal’s burden to demonstrate that the Plaintiffs’ T and U visas are \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 149   Filed 10/15/14   Page 8 of 23 PageID #:  2975\ndiscoverable.  Signal argues that because there are substantial benefits derived from obtaining \none of these visas, there may be an incentive for the Plaintiffs to fabricate their claims or \nexaggerate the extent of the harm that they suffered as a result of Signal’s conduct.  Therefore, \naccording to Signal, these documents are discoverable because they may be probative of the \nPlaintiffs’ motives.3  \n  The information that Signal seeks falls within the broad scope of discovery.  FED. R. CIV. \nP. 26(b) (“Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to \nany party’s claim or defense . . .” and “relevant information need not be admissible at the trial if \nthe discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”).4  \nInformation in the visas and visa applications may shed light on Signal’s claim that the Plaintiffs \n“manufactured  their  allegations  against  Signal,”  or  could  at  least  lead  to  the  discovery  of \nadmissible evidence.  (Doc. No. 122, p. 4.)  For example, in the T visa application, under penalty \nof perjury, a victim must check a box stating that they are a victim of severe trafficking.  The \napplicant is also requested to explain certain answers, such as whether they will suffer extreme \nhardship if removed from the United States, and whether they have reported these acts to law \nenforcement, as well as submit a “personal narrative statement describing the trafficking.”5  See \nI-914, Application for T Nonimmigrant Status, http://www.uscis.gov/i-914.  Moreover, a law \n                                                 \n3.  Signal devotes much of its motion to arguments related to the confrontation clause and its constitutional \nrights to discovery.  These arguments are misplaced.  The confrontation clause, by its terms, only applies in the \ncriminal setting.  U.S. CONST. amend. VI (“In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be \nconfronted with the witnesses against him.”) (emphasis added).  In a civil case, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \ndictate Signal’s rights to information.  So long as this court does not clearly abuse its discretion in applying these \nrules and completely deprive Signal of access to discovery (which in an extreme case may potentially be a due \nprocess violation), Signal’s constitutional rights will have been protected. \n \n4.  See also Local Civil Rule CV-26(d) (noting that information is discoverable if “it is information that is \nlikely to have an influence on or affect the outcome of a claim or defense” or “that deserves to be considered in the \npreparation, evaluation or trial of a claim or defense”). \n \n5.  The Plaintiffs claim that redacted affidavits attached to their visa applications have been produced.  \n(Doc. No. 125, p. 3 n. 1.) \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 149   Filed 10/15/14   Page 9 of 23 PageID #:  2976\nenforcement  officer  may  also  fill  out  a  form  containing  similar  information.    See  I-914, \nSupplement B, Declaration of Law Enforcement Officer for Victim of Trafficking in Persons, \nhttp://www.uscis.gov/i-914 (noting that a person may qualify for a T visa without this form, but \n“submission of the Supplement B is strongly advised”).  In this form, a law enforcement officer \nis to describe the victimization, as well as mark a box on whether the applicant has been a victim \nof trafficking.  Signal is entitled to know what boxes, if any, were checked by the Plaintiffs or \nlaw enforcement, and any proffered descriptions, which would necessarily relate to the events \ngiving rise to this lawsuit. \nIn addition, Signal filed a cross-claim against the other defendants, arguing that if there is \nany wrongdoing, the other defendants are to blame.  (Doc. No. 79, p. 56) (“Plaintiffs’ suit alleges \nthat Signal was part of a concerted wrongdoing directed at foreign workers.  However, Signal \nwas a victim of the cross claim defendants’ actions rather than a willing participant.”).  The \ninformation contained in the visa application, particularly where an applicant is requested to do \nmore than just check a box, but rather, describe their experiences, may be informative.  If, for \nexample, Plaintiffs’ applications made no mention of Signal, but only of the other defendants, \nthis could be highly relevant to this case.  While the undersigned is not determining at this \njuncture whether such evidence will be admissible at trial, it is not beyond belief that it might, at \nthe very least, lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  Therefore, Signal has met its burden \nof demonstrating this information is discoverable.   \niii.  The burden shifts to the Plaintiffs \n  The Plaintiffs argue that they should not be compelled to produce immigration related \ndocuments on two grounds.  First, in its responses to the Plaintiffs discovery requests, Signal \nnarrowed  the  scope  of  discovery  by  claiming  that  documents  from  the  time  that Plaintiffs \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 149   Filed 10/15/14   Page 10 of 23 PageID #:  2977\nstopped working for Signal are irrelevant, and as such, Signal cannot now claim that information \nfrom this period is discoverable.  Second, producing these documents would have an in terrorem \neffect on the Plaintiffs, as well as other victims of trafficking, and therefore, social policies trump \nSignal’s need for the visas. \n1.  The immigration documents are relevant \n  As to the Plaintiffs’ first argument, the undersigned finds that the Plaintiffs’ T and U \nvisas cannot be classified as merely documents relating to the Plaintiffs’ post-Signal activities.  \nFirst, it is unclear when, or even if, any of Plaintiffs sought these visas.  It is plausible that if any \nPlaintiffs applied for these visas, they did so while still employed at Signal.  Moreover, these \ndocuments will likely contain factual statements and assertions about the Plaintiffs’ experiences \nrelated to their trafficking and their experiences while employed by Signal.  Accordingly, even if \nthe Plaintiffs applied for these visas after they left Signal, the information contained in the \napplications is not simply information related to Plaintiffs’ post-Signal activities.  Therefore, \nPlaintiffs’  objection  on  relevancy  grounds  is  not  sufficient  to  deny  Signal  access  to  these \ndocuments. \n2.  The in terrorem effect does not outweigh Signal’s need for the \ndocuments \n \nThe Plaintiffs next argue that, even if the visas are relevant, they should not be required \nto produce them because, if forced to do so, it would dissuade them from prosecuting this case.  \nThis is known as the in terrorem effect, and has been invoked to preclude or limit discovery into \nsensitive topics, particularly immigration status.  \nThe in terrorem effect is predicated on two concepts.  First, that certain remedial statutes, \nin order to achieve their goals, rely on enforcement by private citizens.  See Rivera v. NIBCO, \nInc., 364 F.3d 1057, 1065–66 (9th Cir. 2004) (“Congress intended to empower individuals to act \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 149   Filed 10/15/14   Page 11 of 23 PageID #:  2978\nas  private  attorneys  general  in  enforcing  provisions  of  Title  VII.”);  Kathleen  Kim,  The \nTrafficked Worker as Private Attorney General: A Model for Enforcing the Civil Rights of \nUndocumented Workers, 1 U. CHI. LEGAL F. 247, 251 (2010) (noting that the VTVPA was \namended in 2003 to add a private cause of action “thereby codifying a new class of private \nattorneys  general  and  representing  an  effort  to  extend  civil  rights  protections  to  trafficked \npersons”).  Second, if forced to disclose their immigration status in a lawsuit, victims may be \nreluctant to file suit because, if it is revealed that they are not in the country legally, they may \nface deportation or harassment.  Rivera, 364 F.3d at 1064.  One court even reasoned that \ndocumented  workers  might  be  deterred  from  enforcing  their  rights  for  “fear  that  their \nimmigration status would be changed, or that their status would reveal the immigration problems \nof their family or friends . . . .”  Id. at 1065.  Thus, the in terrorem effect reflects a policy choice \nthat the enforcement of certain statutes outweighs a party’s need for full and unfettered discovery \ninto matters that may be of minimal or no relevance.  Rivera, 364 F.3d at 1064–66 (discussing \nthe policy reasons behind the in terrorem doctrine and holding: “Given Title VII’s dependence \non  private  enforcement,  we  find  that  the  national  effort  to  eradicate  discrimination  in  the \nworkplace would be hampered by the discovery practices [the defendant] seeks to validate \nhere.”); Topo v. Dhir, 210 F.R.D. 76, 78 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (“[A]llowing parties to inquire about \nthe immigration status  of other parties, . . . present[s] a  danger of intimidation  [that] would \ninhibit plaintiffs in pursuing their rights.”) (citation omitted). \nThere is no bright-line rule for when the in terrorem effect should limit discovery.  \nRather, courts balance the unique facts and posture of each case against the relevant social \npolicies  of  the  statutes  at  issue.   See,  e.g.,  Thomas  A.  Doyle,  “Competing  Concerns  in \nEmployment Litigation: How Courts are Managing Discovery of an Employee’s Immigration \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 149   Filed 10/15/14   Page 12 of 23 PageID #:  2979\nStatus,” 28 A.B.A. J. LAB. & EMP. L. 405, 406–14 (Spring 2013) (identifying eight factors courts \noften consider in deciding whether to allow discovery of an employee’s immigration status).  \nThe two most relevant factors that courts tend to consider are: what statute the plaintiff is suing \nunder and the procedural posture of the case.  \nAs for the statute that a plaintiff is suing under, this informs whether immigration status \nis in any way relevant to the underlying case.  Where irrelevant or merely collateral to a party’s \nclaim or defense, courts often preclude immigration related discovery.  See  Topo, 210 F.R.D. at \n77–78.  For example, the Fifth Circuit granted a writ of mandamus and reversed a trial court’s \norder requiring the plaintiffs to answer questions related to their immigration status, because the \n“protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act are applicable to citizens and aliens alike and \nwhether the alien is documented or undocumented is irrelevant.”  In re Reyes, 814 F.2d 168, \n170–71 (5th Cir. 1987); see also EEOC v. Evans Fruit Co., Inc., CV-10-3033-LRS, 2012 WL \n442025  (E.D.  Wash.  Feb.  10,  2012)  (noting  that  immigration  status  has  no  bearing  on \ndetermining liability under Title VII).  Conversely, when immigration status is arguably relevant, \ncourts have allowed for discovery.  See Cazorla v. Koch Foods of Miss., L.L.C., No. 3:10-cv-\n135, 2014 WL 281979, at *2 (S.D. Miss. Jan. 24, 2014). \nThe heart of the issue in this case is human trafficking.  One could argue that, like claims \nunder Title VII or the FLSA, immigration status is irrelevant to claim for trafficking.  See In re \nReyes, 814 F.2d at 170–71.  A person can bring a trafficking claim regardless of whether they \nare a citizen, legal immigrant, or undocumented worker.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 1590.  However, \nsomething sets a trafficking claim apart from one brought pursuant to Title VII or the FLSA—\nthe T and U visa.  These visas create a safe harbor, allowing victims of trafficking and certain \nother crimes to stay in the United States legally while prosecuting their case.  No such equivalent \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 149   Filed 10/15/14   Page 13 of 23 PageID #:  2980\nvisa, amnesty, or safe harbor exists for a plaintiff bringing an FLSA or Title VII claim. \nThe availability of these visas impact the in terrorem analysis in two important respects.  \nFirst, they create an incentive for an undocumented worker to fabricate or exaggerate a claim of \nhuman trafficking.  See Cazorla, 2014 WL 281979, at *1 (noting that certain immigration \nbenefits were available to plaintiffs due to their allegations).  The undersigned is not insinuating \nthat this is the case here.  However, it appears that this is at least conceivable, and Signal should \nhave the opportunity to explore this possibility.  Second, they create a safe harbor for illegal \nimmigrants who were victims of trafficking.  One of the underpinnings of the in terrorem effect \nis that undocumented workers will be less likely to seek redress for fear that their immigration \nstatus will be revealed and they will then face deportation.  Because an undocumented worker \nwho was the victim of severe trafficking can receive a T or U visa, any chilling effect is greatly \nminimized.  In fact, it is difficult to imagine an undocumented worker who would bring a civil \nsuit alleging to be a victim of trafficking, but fail to seek such a visa.  Or, stated another way, it \nis difficult to comprehend an instance in which a person would not report that they were a victim \nof human trafficking for fear their T visa would be potentially discoverable in a lawsuit years \nlater—a lawsuit they themselves initiated.  The only workers whose rights might be chilled \nwould be those who were trafficked but failed to qualify for either visa.  Empirical evidence, \nhowever, suggests that this is a relatively small group, and the Plaintiffs have not suggested that \ncould be the case here.6 \n                                                 \n6.  From 2002 through 2012, 5,820 T-1 visa applications, which are visas issued directly to the victim, were \nfiled.  See U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Form I-914 – Application for T Nonimmigrant Status, Form I-\n918 – Petition for Nonimmigrant Status Receipts, Approvals, and Denials, Fiscal Year 2013, Through Third Quarter, \nhttp://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-studies/immigration-forms-data/data-set-form-i-914-application-t-nonimmigrant-\nstatus (last visited October 15, 2014).  Of those applied for, 1,671 were denied, equating to 29%.  As for T-2,3,4 or 5 \nvisas, which are available to family members of a victim, 606 applications, or 20%, were denied.  From 2009 \nthrough 2012, 18% of U-1 visa (victim visas) were denied, and 16% of U-2,3,4,5 (family member visas) were \ndenied.     \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 149   Filed 10/15/14   Page 14 of 23 PageID #:  2981\nThe procedural posture of a case also impacts the in terrorem analysis.  For example, in \nRivera, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the trial court’s issuance of a protective order precluding \ndiscovery related to immigration status, because such discovery was irrelevant at that time to the \nissue before the court, which was liability (as opposed to damages) under Title VII.  Rivera, 364 \nF.3d at 1074–75.  The trial court, however, had yet to decide whether the proceedings were going \nto be bifurcated, leaving the door open to the possibility that the analysis may change in the \nfuture.  See Rivera, 364 F.3d at 1062, 1070.  As one court subsequently noted, “Rivera did not \nforeclose the possibility that immigration status, although clearly irrelevant to the Title VII \nliability determination, might not become relevant later in the remedies portion of the litigation.”  \nRodriguez v. ACL Farms, Inc., No. cv-10-3010, 2010 WL 4683743, *4 (E.D. Wash. Nov. 12, \n2010).  Likewise, in David, one of the parallel cases pending in the Eastern District of Louisiana, \nwhen the court first entered the protective order (that the Plaintiffs argue the undersigned should \nadopt), the issue being resolved was class certification.  David, 257 F.R.D. at 125.  Immigration \nstatus of the plaintiffs had no bearing on the issues of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and \nadequacy of representation.  Id.   \nCourts, however, have recognized that as a case progresses and moves towards trial, the \npendulum begins to swing in favor of allowing discovery, and depending on the facts of the case, \na defendant’s need may outweigh any social policies that would otherwise prevent disclosure.  \nSee Cazorla, 2014 WL 281979 at *1.  For example, in Cazorla, Koch Foods of Mississippi was \naccused of committing atrocities against Hispanic workers.  Id.  The court, early in the case, \nentered a protective order prohibiting discovery of immigration related documents.  Id.  Koch \nFoods  later  sought  reconsideration  of  the  protective  order  and  specifically  to  compel  the \nproduction of the plaintiffs’ U visas.  Id.  The court granted Koch’s motion as to the visas, noting \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 149   Filed 10/15/14   Page 15 of 23 PageID #:  2982\nthat they were relevant because “immigration benefits may be made available to [the plaintiffs] \nbecause of the allegations they have made.”  Id.  The court held: \nThe issue is the relevance of the information sought by Koch Foods to the claims \nand defenses in this action.  Koch Foods has raised a legitimate defense regarding \nU  visas,  T  visas,  or  other  immigration  benefits,  and  it  is  entitled  to  pursue \ndiscovery, including visa applications, that supports the defense.  The relevance of \nthis information clearly outweighs its in terrorem effect, as any individuals who \nhave applied for immigration benefits have, necessarily, already disclosed their \nimmigration status to federal authorities.  \n \nId. at *2.  Likewise, other courts, after balancing all the factors, have found that a defendant’s \nneed for information outweighed any potential in terrorem effect.  See Camayo v. John Peroulis \n& Sons Sheep, Inc., Nos. 10-cv-772, 11-cv-1132, 2012 WL 5931716, at *1–2 (D. Colo. Nov. 27, \n2012) (granting a motion to compel production of the plaintiffs’ T or U visas in a human \ntrafficking case); EEOC v. Global Horizons, Inc., No. cv-11-3045, 2013 WL 3940674, at *4–7 \n(E.D.  Wash  July  31,  2013)  (lifting  the  prohibition  on  discovery  related  to  the  plaintiffs’ \nimmigration status because the information was relevant, and the plaintiffs failed to show good \ncause warranting a continued limitation). \n  After  weighing  all  the  relevant  factors  and  policies,  the  undersigned  finds  that  the \nPlaintiffs have failed to meet  their burden  of  showing that “good cause” exists to  enter a \nprotective order precluding production of the Plaintiffs’ visa related documents.  The Plaintiffs \nhave not demonstrated that there would in fact be a chilling effect if, at this stage, they were \nrequired to disclose their visas.  See In re Terra Int’l, Inc., 134 F.3d 302, 306 (5th Cir. 1998) \n(noting that a party must make “a particular and specific demonstration of fact as distinguished \nfrom stereotyped and conclusory statements”).  What the undersigned finds most compelling is \nthat, in this context, any chilling effect is largely offset by the availability of the T or U visa.  A \nvictim of trafficking does not need to choose between risking deportation by filing suit to rectify \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 149   Filed 10/15/14   Page 16 of 23 PageID #:  2983\na wrong, or allowing atrocities to go unpunished in order to avoid bringing attention to their \nimmigration status.  Instead, purported victims of human trafficking are allowed to blow the \nwhistle on their employers while at the same time being protected from deportation by obtaining \na T visa.  While there may be a small subset of people who are legitimate victims of trafficking \nbut denied a T visa, when balanced against the relevancy of this information and Signal’s need \nfor it, the undersigned finds protecting this small and undefined class is an insufficient reason to \ndeny Signal the information it seeks.   \nAccordingly, the undersigned grants Signals’ motion as to the Plaintiffs’ T and U visas. \niv.  Limits  on  further  discovery  and  on  the  use  and  dissemination  of  the \nPlaintiffs’ documents \n \nThe Plaintiffs seek to block Signal from obtaining personal information about them, as \nwell as their relatives.  (Doc. No. 125, p. 10.)  As discussed above, some discovery into the \nPlaintiffs’  immigration  status  is  permissible.    Nevertheless,  discovery  aimed  at  sensitive \ninformation of people who are not parties to this case may very well have an in terrorem effect \non the Plaintiffs and deter them from prosecuting this suit.  Signal, however, has not made such a \nrequest.7  Therefore, at this time, there is no need to enter a broad protective order.  Should \nSignal seek such discovery, the undersigned will at that time weigh the potential in terrorem \neffect against Signal’s need for the information, and the balance of the various factors may very \nwell change.   \nIn addition, it is worth noting that discovery related to the immigration status of friends \nand relatives would appear to be irrelevant.  For example, a condition precedent of a family \nmember receiving a visa is that the victim be awarded a visa.  8 C.F.R. § 214.11(o) (“an alien \nwho has applied for and been granted T-1 nonimmigrant status may apply for admission of an \n                                                 \n7.  See supra Note 1. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 149   Filed 10/15/14   Page 17 of 23 PageID #:  2984\nimmediate  family  member  .  .  .  .”).    Therefore,  production  of  the  named  Plaintiffs’  visa \ninformation should be sufficient for Signal to test its theories regarding the Plaintiffs’ motives.  \nShould  Signal  seek  discovery  related  to  the  Plaintiffs’  family  members,  it  will  need  to \ndemonstrate a particular need.  However, because it is theoretically possible that such a need \nmay exist, the undersigned will address that issue if and when it presents itself.  \nThe  Plaintiffs  shall  designate  any  documents  produced  pursuant  to  this  order  as \n“Confidential” and those documents are to be treated as “Protected Documents,” as defined in \nthe protective order governing this case.  (Doc. Nos. 55 and 94.)  Moreover, the undersigned is \nmindful that to some extent this order conflicts with ones that have been entered in the cases \npending in the Eastern District of Louisiana.  Therefore, to prevent Signal from circumventing \nthe protective orders in other cases, Signal may only use information regarding the Plaintiffs \nvisas in this case; use outside this case, in any manner, including depositions, motions, etc., \nparticularly in the EEOC case, which shares common plaintiffs, would be a violation of this \norder and would subject the violating party to sanctions.  \nb.  Post-Signal documents \n  In addition to the immigration materials discussed above, Signal also seeks to compel \nproduction of “other similar evidence, including evidence as to the lives of the plaintiffs after \nSignal employment.”  (Doc. No. 122, p. 1–2.)  Signal, however, fails to cite which particular \nRequests for Production it is seeking to have the Plaintiffs respond to, and fails to cite with any \nspecificity what documents it is seeking.  See, e.g., Hart v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 270 \nF.R.D. 166, 169 (D. Del. 2010) (“Plaintiff makes only generalized arguments about Defendant’s \nresponses, and the Court will not undertake a review of each of the 65 document requests \nwithout more specific guidance from Plaintiff on what responses it is challenging and why.”).  \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 149   Filed 10/15/14   Page 18 of 23 PageID #:  2985\nThe only actual guidance that Signal offers is a reference of “see Exhibit 1, pp. 4-9,” which \ncovers Requests for Production Nos. 1 through 10, and that it is seeking “written material \nconcerning the lives of the plaintiffs after Signal employment.”  (Doc. No. 122, p. 11.)  It is not \nthe role of the undersigned to parse out Signal’s Requests for Production or guess at which \nrequests Signal seeks responses.  Plaintiffs contend that at issue, other than the specific requests \nfor visas, are Requests for Production Nos. 2 (current driver’s license) and 47 (first paycheck \nfrom an employer located in the U.S. other than Signal).  (Doc. 125, p. 1.)   \nSignal has failed to carry its burden of demonstrating that these materials are relevant, or \nwill lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  Signal’s motion is almost exclusively focused \non compelling production of the Plaintiffs’ T and U visas, and only vaguely argues that this other \ninformation is needed because it will “deepen the jury’s appreciation of the motives of the \nplaintiffs.”  (Doc. No. 122, p. 2.)  For instance, Signal does not address why it needs copies of \nthe Plaintiffs’ current driver’s license, why it needs a copy of Plaintiffs’ first paycheck after they \nleft Signal, or how this information may lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  Signal’s \nfailure to demonstrate with precision what it is seeking, or why this information is relevant, is \nreason  enough  to  deny  Signal’s  motion.   See  Hart,  270  F.R.D.  at  169  (“While  the  Court \nrecognizes the potential relevance [of the information sought] . . . Plaintiff has not directed the \nCourt’s attention to any particular document request or to make any particularized argument with \nrespect to a document request.”). \n  However, there is an additional reason to deny Signal’s request—Signal has objected to \nseveral requests for production propounded by the Plaintiffs on the grounds that:  \ndocuments requested for the time frame January 1, 2004 through July 31, 2005 \nand February 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009 are not relevant or likely to \nlead to the discovery of relevant information.  Signal objects to the date range in \nthis request because only events during the recruitment of the H2B workers and \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 149   Filed 10/15/14   Page 19 of 23 PageID #:  2986\ntheir time of employment at Signal are probative of the claims in this action.  \n \n(Doc. No. 125, Ex. 1, pp. 2, 4–5, 7.) (emphasis added).  Signal cannot refuse to produce \ndocuments on grounds that any documents from outside a certain period are irrelevant to the \ndispute, and then seek to compel production of documents from this same timeframe.  As the \nPlaintiffs correctly note, “the Signal Defendants cannot have it both ways.”  (Doc. No. 125, p. 7.)  \nBecause Signal has objected to any discovery after the Plaintiffs left Signal, and from the \ninformation before the court there is no indication that Signal withdrew these objections or that \nthe parties have subsequently agreed to expand the relevant period for discovery, the undersigned \ndenies Signal’s motion as to “the lives of the Plaintiffs after Signal employment.”    \n2.  Plaintiffs’ “Motion for Interim Protective Order Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(d)(3)” \n(Doc. No. 140) \n \nPlaintiffs allege that Signal is seeking information during depositions that is calculated to \nhave an in terrorem effect, and they have requested that the undersigned enter a protective order \n“limit[ing]  depositions  of  the  Samuel  Plaintiffs  and  any  other  witnesses  with  relevant \ninformation  so  as  to  exclude  any  questions  having  an  in  terrorem  effect  on  the  Samuel \nPlaintiffs . . .  including  discovery  of  immigration  status,  immigration  history,  employment \nhistory, and personal information of the Samuel Plaintiffs.”  (Doc. No. 140.)  As discussed \nabove, it is the Plaintiffs’ burden to show that good exists warranting a protective order.  See In \nre  Terra  Int’l,  Inc.,  134  F.3d  302,  306  (5th  Cir.  1998).    For  reasons  detailed  below,  the \nundersigned finds that the Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden, and therefore, declines to \nenter broad protective order at this time. \nPlaintiffs  argue  that  there  are  “three  categories  of  behavior”  that  evidence  Signal’s \ndiscovery abuses and demonstrate the need for a protective order.  (Doc. No. 140, p. 4.)  First, \nthat Signal is attempting to harass the Plaintiffs by seeking information related to their family \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 149   Filed 10/15/14   Page 20 of 23 PageID #:  2987\nmembers.  As evidence, the Plaintiffs offer portions of a deposition transcript containing an \nexchange between one of the Plaintiffs and Signal.  (Id., Ex. A.)  There are two excerpts that \nwarrant attention.  In one excerpt, Signal asked whether this Plaintiff’s brother had a green card.  \nIn another, Signal indicated a desire to depose this Plaintiff’s brother and requested his contact \ninformation.  It appears from the broken record before the court that Signal is trying to piece \ntogether an argument that because this Plaintiff was in contact with a relative prior to his \nemployment with Signal, who had knowledge of the immigration process, that this Plaintiff \nknows  more  about  the  immigration  process  than  he  is  letting  on.    It  is  plausible  that  the \nPlaintiff’s brother may corroborate this, and therefore, Signal should be allowed to depose the \nPlaintiff’s brother because this information is highly relevant to some of the claims and defenses \nin this case.   \nTherefore,  the  undersigned  does  not  find  that  all  inquiries  of  relatives  and  family \nmembers should be off limits.  However, if Signal were to depose a non-party family member, \nthis deposition should be narrowly tailored to the issues in this case.  For reasons discussed \nabove, the current immigration or employment status of a Plaintiffs’ relatives or friends does not \nappear relevant to the issues in this case, nor does it appear reasonably calculated to lead to the \ndiscovery  of  admissible  evidence.    Intrusive  and  probing  discovery  into  the  lives  of  the \nPlaintiffs’ family may very well have an in terrorem effect on the Plaintiffs.  See Rivera, 364 \nF.3d at 1065–66 (discussing the fear that undocumented workers face in bringing suit, and noting \nthat even some documented workers may be deterred because “their status would reveal the \nimmigration problems of their family and friends . . . ”).  Whether to allow such questioning \nwould call for a fact-specific analysis, and without knowing who Signal is seeking to depose, \nwhat is being asked, and why, the undersigned cannot determine whether the questioning is \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 149   Filed 10/15/14   Page 21 of 23 PageID #:  2988\npermissible.  The undersigned is not going to attempt to delineate the contours of what issues \nSignal may or may not inquire about without being presented a specific factual dispute.8  \nSecond, the Plaintiffs argue that Signal has inappropriately used information gleaned \nfrom a deposition in this case in another matter.  (Doc. No. 140, p. 5–6.)  In other words, Signal \nis using the lack of a protective order in this case to circumvent protective orders in other cases.  \n(Doc. No. 125, p. 5–6.)  Because the undersigned does not find that a protective order like the \none entered in David is warranted, to prohibit a party from circumventing a protective order in \nanother case, the undersigned orders that information learned in this case, that would be subject \nto a protective order in another case, cannot be used in that case.  In other words, there is a \n“Chinese wall” between all of the various matters as it relates to the Plaintiffs’ T and U visas.9  \nFrom the date of this order forward, violation of this separation between cases, as it relates to \nimmigration related discovery, will be considered an abuse of the discovery process and subject \nthe violating party to sanctions.  At the time of the deposition, however, there was no protective \norder  in  place  in  this  case  protecting  this  information.    While  better  judgment  may  have \ncounseled against using information from this case in another case (particularly one in which a \nprotective order precluding such discovery was in place), technically Signal did not violate any \nof this court’s orders. \nThird, the Plaintiffs complain that deposition transcripts, which were marked “highly \nconfidential” from this case, were filed, not under seal, in another case pending in the Eastern \nDistrict of Texas.  (Doc. No. 140, p. 7.)  There is no order in this case that would compel, or even \n                                                 \n8.  Should another dispute about an appropriate line of questioning arise during a deposition, the parties are \nreminded that this District maintains a discovery hotline that allows the parties to get an immediate resolution of \ntheir issues and carry on with the deposition.  See Local Civil Rule CV-26(e). \n \n9.  This does not impact the “Consent Order Regarding Use of Discovery from Related Cases.”  (Doc. No. \n96.)  Rather, this mandate only applies to sensitive information produced pursuant to Signal’s motion to compel. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 149   Filed 10/15/14   Page 22 of 23 PageID #:  2989\nallow, for this to be filed under seal.  Local Civil Rule CV-5(a)(7) states: “Unless authorized by \nstatute or rule, a document in a civil case shall not be filed under seal” unless counsel has moved \nto seal the document, or the “court has already granted authorization to seal the document.”  \n(emphasis  added).   The  only  protective  order  in  this  case  relates  to  the  dissemination  of \n“confidential proprietary and business information and/or trade secrets” (Doc. No. 55); this does \nnot cover personal information regarding immigration status. \nMoreover, the undersigned does not find that the use of the excerpt goes so far as to the \npoint of being harassing.  It merely indicates that one of the Plaintiffs received a T visa.  Signal \nis simply trying to draw the parallel that it is likely that the Plaintiffs in that case have also \nreceived a T visa.  However, since this order clarifies that information learned in one case about \na Plaintiffs’ immigration status may not be used in another, moving forward, this is should not to \nbe an issue. \nUltimately, the Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden for why a broad protective \norder should be entered.  Plaintiffs’ arguments about the in terrorem effect are wholly general, \nand fail to detail precisely how these Plaintiffs will be deterred from prosecuting this suit.  \nMoreover, for reasons stated above, the undersigned finds that  in terrorem effect does not \noperate in this case to close off all immigration related lines of questioning.  The areas that \nSignal  is  inquiring  about  are  relevant,  or  at  the  very  least,  may  lead  to  the  discovery  of \nadmissible  evidence.    Should  the  Plaintiffs’  believe  that  Signal  is  crossing  the  line,  the \nundersigned will address those concerns on a case-by-case basis.     \nV. Conclusion \n  It  is  therefore  ORDERED  that  Signal’s  “Motion  to  Compel”  (Doc.  No.  122)  is \nGRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.  Within seven (7) days, the Plaintiffs shall \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 149   Filed 10/15/14   Page 23 of 23 PageID #:  2990\nproduce documents responsive to Signal’s Requests for Production Nos. 7 and 8, including \ninformation related to U visas.  Signal’s motion as it relates to “other similar evidence, including \nevidence as to the lives of the plaintiffs after Signal employment” is DENIED.  Furthermore, the \nPlaintiffs’ requests for the entry of a protective order (Doc. Nos. 125 and 140) are DENIED. \n  Lastly, Signal is precluded from using information related to the Plaintiffs’ immigration \nstatus gathered through the discovery process in this case, in any other matter pending in either \nthe Eastern District of Texas or Eastern District of Louisiana. \nSIGNED this 15th day of October, 2014.\n__________________________________________________\nZaacckk HHaawwtthhoorrnn\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n23 \n ",

Having considered the pending motion and the corresponding Response (Doc. No. \n21), Reply (Doc. No. 23), and Sur-Reply (Doc. No. 33), in light of the Plaintiffs’ Complaint (Doc. \nNo. 1), the undersigned recommends that the Motion to Transfer Action be denied because there is \nnot a substantial overlap between the instant suit and Kurian David et al. v. Signal, Int’l, L.L.C. et. \nal., the first filed suit. \nI.  Background \nA.  Procedural Background \n  On March 7, 2008, twelve individuals who allegedly were trafficked into the United States \nfiled a putative class action in the Eastern District of Louisiana.  See David v. Signal Int’l, LLC, \nCiv.  A.  No.  08-1220  (E.D.  La.).   The  Court  denied  class  certification  for  the  Plaintiffs’ \n \nPage 1 of 8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 56   Filed 12/02/13   Page 2 of 8 PageID #:  1300\ntrafficking, RICO, civil rights and state law contract and fraud claims.1  David v. Signal Int’l, \nLLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. Jan. 3, 2012).  As a \nresult of this ruling, the Plaintiffs in the instant action filed suit in this District, where they were \nallegedly enslaved.  (Doc. No. 21 at 9.)  On May 21, 2013, the Plaintiffs filed a Complaint in this \ncourt against the following Defendants: Signal, Malven C. Burnett, Gulf Coast Immigration Law \nCenter, L.L.C., Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C., Global Resources, Inc., Michael Pol, \nSachin Dewan, and Dewan Consultants PVT. LTD. (a/k/a Medtech Consultants).  (Doc. No. 1.)  \nThe Plaintiffs allege that some or all of the Defendants violated the following federal statutes: 1) \nThe Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003; 2) Racketeer Influenced and \nCorrupt Organizations Act; 3) The Civil Rights act of 1866; and 4) The Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871.  \n(Id.)  In addition, the Plaintiffs bring state law fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach of \ncontract claims against all of the Defendants.  (Id. at 46-48.)  On July 29, 2013, the Signal \nDefendants filed the pending Motion to Transfer Action Pursuant to First Filed Rule.  (Doc. No. \n12.)   \nB.  Factual Background    \n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, approximately 590 men, including the Plaintiffs, \nwere allegedly trafficked into the United States through the federal government’s H-2B guest \nworker program to provide services to the Signal Defendants.  (Doc. No. 1 at 2.)  The Plaintiffs \nclaim that they were lured to work for Signal through the fraudulent promise of legal and \npermanent work-based immigration to the United States for themselves and their families.  (Id.)  \n                                                 \n  1.  The District Court has not ruled on the collective action FLSA claims in the David case, which include \nopt-ins by the Plaintiffs in this case.  (Doc. No. 21 at 4.) \n \nPage 2 of 8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 56   Filed 12/02/13   Page 3 of 8 PageID #:  1301\nSubsequently, after coming to the United States, the Plaintiffs were allegedly subjected to forced \nlabor and other serious abuses at Signal operations in Orange, Texas.  (Id. at 4.)  Each Plaintiff \nhas a different story as to their recruitment, travel and abuse while working for Signal.  (Doc. No. \n21 at 8.)  \nII.  Jurisdiction \n  The Plaintiffs seek recovery pursuant to several federal statutes.  For actions brought \nunder these statutory provisions, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon federal \nquestion jurisdiction.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1331; 29 U.S.C. § 216(b).  For the state law causes of \naction, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon supplemental jurisdiction.  See \n28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).  Venue is proper because the events giving rise to the above claims occurred \nwithin the confines of this District.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1391.  \nIII.  First to File Rule  \n  “Under the first-to-file rule, when related cases are pending before two federal courts, the \ncourt in which the case was last filed may refuse to hear it if the issues raised by the cases \nsubstantially overlap.”  Int’l Fid. Ins. Co. v. Sweet Little Mexico Corp., 665 F.3d 671, 677 (5th \nCir. 2011) (quoting Cadle Co. v. Whataburger of Alice, Inc., 174 F.3d 599, 603 (5th Cir. 1999)).  \n“The first-to-file rule is a discretionary doctrine.” Jones v. Xerox Commercial Solutions, LLC, \nCIV. A. No. H-13-0650, 2013 WL 3245957, at *2 (S.D. Tex. June 26, 2013) (quoting Cadle Co., \n174 F.3d at 603).  The rule is utilized “to avoid the waste of duplication, to avoid rulings which \nmay trench upon the authority of sister courts, and to avoid piecemeal resolution of issues that call \nfor a uniform result.”  Save Power Ltd. v. Syntek Fin. Corp., 121 F.3d 947, 950 (5th Cir. 1997).  \n \nPage 3 of 8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 56   Filed 12/02/13   Page 4 of 8 PageID #:  1302\nThe party wishing to transfer the case has the burden to prove that transfer is warranted.  Jones, \n2013 WL 3245957, at *2 (citing Sanofi–Aventis Deutschland GmbH v. Novo Nordisk, Inc., 614 F. \nSupp.  2d  772,  777  n.  5  (E.D.  Tex.  2009);  VCode  Holdings,  Inc.  v.  Cognex  Corp.,  No. \n2:07–CV–138, 2007 WL 2238054, at *2 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 3, 2007); Buckalew v. Celanese, LTD., \nNo. G–05–315, 2005 WL 2266619, at *1 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 16, 2005)).  “In deciding whether to \napply the first-to-file rule, the Court must resolve two questions: (1) are the two pending actions so \nduplicative or do they involve such substantially similar issues that one court should decide the \nsubject matter of both actions, and if so, (2) which of the two courts should take the case.”  \nDatamize, Inc. v. Fid. Brokerage Servs., LLC, 2:03-CV-321-DF, 2004 WL 1683171, at *3 (E.D. \nTex. Apr. 22, 2004) (citing Texas Instruments v. Micron Semiconductor, 815 F. Supp. 994, 997 \n(E.D. Tex. 1993)).  “The first-to-file rule does not require that cases be identical, but merely that \nthere is a substantial overlap in issues and parties.”  White v. Peco Foods, Inc., 546 F. Supp. 2d \n339, 342 (S.D. Miss. 2008).  “Once the likelihood of substantial overlap between the two suits has \nbeen demonstrated, it is no longer up to the second-filed court to resolve the question of whether \nboth should be allowed to proceed.”  Id. (quoting Cadle Co., 174 F.3d at 605).   \nIV.  Analysis \n  The Signal Defendants argue that there is substantial overlap between the instant case and \nthe first filed case, David.  While there are similarities in the two cases, the undersigned finds that \nthe two cases do not involve such substantially similar parties and issues that one court should \ndecide the subject matter of both actions. \n \nPage 4 of 8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 56   Filed 12/02/13   Page 5 of 8 PageID #:  1303\nA.  Parties \n  There is some overlap between the parties in David and the instant case, but it is not \nsubstantial.  While all of the Plaintiffs in the instant suit are also plaintiffs in David, as explained \nbelow, they are only asserting FLSA claims in David, which they do not assert here.2  The \nPlaintiffs also do not object to the David court transferring their FLSA claims to this court.3  (Doc. \nNo. 21 at 10.)  If the David court was to transfer those claims, then there would be no common \nplaintiffs in either case.  Conversely, none of the David plaintiffs asserting non-FLSA claims are \nparties in the instant case.  (Id.)   The David defendants and the Defendants in this suit are not \ncompletely identical, but for purposes of this analysis, the court agrees with Signal that the \ndifference is insignificant.   (Doc. No. 12 at 3-5.)  While the first-to-file rule does not require \nidentical parties, see Save Power Ltd., 121 F.3d at 950, “the fact that the parties are different cuts \nagainst an argument for substantial overlap.”  Jones, 2013 WL 3245957, at *4.   \nB.  Claims \n  While the first-to-file rule also does not require the issues to completely overlap, “the cases \nshould be more than merely related to support a motion to transfer when venue is otherwise \nappropriate.”  Buckalew v. Celanese, Ltd., CIV. A. No. G-05-315, 2005 WL 2266619, at *2 (S.D. \nTex. Sept. 16, 2005).  The instant suit and David are related to the extent that all of the claims \nasserted in this suit are also asserted by the different David Plaintiffs.  However, there is not \n                                                 \n2. Even if the Plaintiffs in this case were at one point putative class members in the David class action \nlitigation, they were never parties since the class was never certified.  See Smith v. Bayer Corp., 131 S. Ct. 2368, \n2379 (2011) (holding that it is erroneous to believe a nonnamed class member is a party to class action litigation before \nthe class is certified, or if certification is ultimately denied). \n \n3. In fact, it appears that the Plaintiffs may have already requested this relief with the David court.  See \nJoseph v. Signal International LLC et al., No. 1:13-CV-324 (Doc. No. 54 at 2, n. 2). \n \nPage 5 of 8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 56   Filed 12/02/13   Page 6 of 8 PageID #:  1304\nsubstantial overlap among the claims in both suits.  As the District Court established in its opinion \ndenying the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification in David, each of the Plaintiffs’ claims \nrequire individualized proof as it pertains to that particular Plaintiff.  David v. Signal Int’l, LLC, \nCiv. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. Jan. 3, 2012).  Thus, not \nonly are each of the individual plaintiffs’ forced labor, trafficking, RICO and civil rights claims \ndifferent from one another in this suit, as explained below, they are entirely different from their \npending FLSA claims in David.  Therefore, the issues presented by the Plaintiffs cannot be \nresolved in the David suit.  W. Gulf Mar. Ass’n v. ILA Deep Sea Local 24, S. Atl. & Gulf Coast \nDist. of ILA, AFL-CIO, 751 F.2d 721, 729 (5th Cir. 1985). \n  1.  Forced Labor and Trafficking \n  The  success  of  each  Plaintiff’s  forced  labor  and  trafficking  claims  is  dependent  on \nindividualized factors.  The question in a forced labor case is “whether Defendants’ coercive \nconduct was such that it could overcome the will of the victim so as to make him render his labor \ninvoluntary.”  David, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247 at 77.  “This question cannot be answered \nvia  generalized  class-wide  proof  but  rather  must  be  answered  individually  based  upon \nindividualized proof.”  Id.  Similarly, with trafficking, “individual issues will play a significant \npart” because involuntary servitude is an essential element of the claim.  Id. at 80-81.   \n  2.  RICO Claims \n  The success of each Plaintiff’s RICO claim is also based on each individual’s experience \nbecause the Plaintiffs will be “required to prove that the [Defendants] committed the predicate acts \nupon which they rely for the pattern of racketeering activity.”  Id. at 92.  As stated above, proof \n \nPage 6 of 8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 56   Filed 12/02/13   Page 7 of 8 PageID #:  1305\nof the predicate acts of trafficking and forced labor are “all premised on coercion” and “cannot be \nmade without resort to individualized proof.”  Id.  Additionally, in order to prove the fraud-based \npredicate acts, each Plaintiff will “have to prove first-party reliance on the alleged fraud that was \ndirected at them,” because “the question of individual reliance [is] paramount to resolving whether \nPlaintiffs’ injuries were caused by a RICO violation.”  Id. at 105-06. \n  3.  Civil Rights Claims \n \n  The Plaintiffs are suing the Signal Defendants under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 for violating their \nrights to “enjoy and benefit from non-discriminatory employment relationships” with the Signal \nDefendants.  (Doc. No. 1 at 44.)  In order to obtain compensatory damages under this claim, as \nsought by the Plaintiffs, each “Plaintiff must prove actual injury to himself and that injury must be \nattributable to (caused by) the Defendant’s disparate treatment.”  David, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n114247, at *119.  For this reason, the outcome of each Plaintiff’s case will vary based on their \nindividualized experience.  \n  4.  Violations of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 \n  The Plaintiffs also allege that the Defendants violated the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1971 by \nviolating their right to be free from “forced labor, involuntary servitude, and trafficking in \npersons.”  (Doc. No. 1 at 45.)  Forced labor, involuntary servitude, and trafficking all include an \nelement of coercion, which requires an individualized analysis of each Plaintiff’s situation, as \nstated above.  David, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *128.   \n  As one can easily discern, none of the above causes of action involve substantially similar \nissues to the Plaintiffs’ FLSA claims pending in David, which include claims of violating the \n \nPage 7 of 8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 56   Filed 12/02/13   Page 8 of 8 PageID #:  1306\nfederally mandated minimum wage laws.  The undersigned agrees with the Plaintiffs that the \nproof required for the FLSA claims and the remedies sought are distinct from the proof and \nremedies at issue in the instant matter.  Given that there is not a substantial overlap of the claims \nbetween the David litigation and this case, and with the exception of the Plaintiffs’ FLSA claims in \nDavid, none of the Plaintiffs in the instant suit and David overlap, the court’s denial of the Signal \nDefendants’ motion to transfer will not result in “piecemeal resolution of issues that call for a \nuniform result.”  Save Power Ltd. v. Syntek Fin. Corp., 121 F.3d 947, 950 (5th Cir. 1997).   \nV.  Conclusion \n \n  The undersigned finds that the instant suit does not substantially overlap with the first-filed \nsuit, David.  Accordingly, the Signal Defendants’ Motion to Transfer Action Pursuant to First \nFiled Rule (Doc. No. 12) is DENIED. \nSIGNED this 2nd day of December, 2013.\n__________________________________________________\nZaacckk HHaawwtthhoorrnn\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n \nPage 8 of 8 \n \n ",

NO. 13) \n \n  This case is assigned to the Honorable Marcia Crone, United States District Judge, and is \nreferred to the undersigned United States magistrate judge to conduct all pretrial proceedings, to \nenter findings of fact and recommend disposition on case-dispositive matters, and to determine \nnon-dispositive matters.  (Doc. No. 5.)  Before the undersigned magistrate judge is a Motion to \nDismiss Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) filed by Defendants Signal International, L.L.C., \nSignal International, Inc., Signal International Texas, G.P., and Signal International Texas, L.P. \n(hereinafter collectively referred to as “Signal”).  For the reasons stated below, Signal’s Motion to \nDismiss (Doc. No. 13) should be denied. \nI.  Jurisdiction \nThe Plaintiffs are a group of seventeen skilled construction workers of Indian descent who \nwere allegedly lured to the United States by Signal and a network of recruiters working on Signal’s \nbehalf.  (Doc. No. 1.)  In their complaint, the Plaintiffs assert four causes of action pursuant to \nfederal  statutory  and  constitutional  law:  violations  of  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection \nReauthorization Act (18 U.S.C. § 1595); the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act \n(18 U.S.C. § 1962); the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. § 1981); the Ku Klux Klan Act of \n1871 (42 U.S.C. § 1985) and the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  (Doc. \nNo. 1.)  For actions brought under federal statutory and constitutional provisions, the court has \n1 of 8 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 65   Filed 02/18/14   Page 2 of 8 PageID #:  1540\nsubject matter jurisdiction predicated upon federal question jurisdiction.  See 28 U.S.C. §1331.  \nIn their fifth and sixth causes of action, the Plaintiffs bring state law claims of fraud, negligent \nmisrepresentation,  and  breach  of  contract.    (Doc.  No.  1.)      The  court  has  supplemental \njurisdiction over the state law causes of action.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1367.  Venue is proper in this \ncase because the events giving rise to the claims occurred within the confines of this district.  See \n28 U.S.C. § 1391.  \nII.  Rule 12(b)(6) Standard \nRule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes dismissal of a complaint \nthat fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  A Rule \n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss “is viewed with disfavor and is rarely granted.”  Harrington v. State \nFarm Fire & Cas. Co., 563 F.3d 141, 147 (5th Cir. 2009).  When a court analyzes a Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion, it “accepts ‘all well-pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light most favorable to the \nplaintiff.’”  In re Katrina Beaches Litig., 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Martin K. \nEby Constr. Co. v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit, 369 F.3d 464, 467 (5th Cir. 2004)).  A court should \ngrant such a motion only when the complaint fails to contain “enough facts to state a claim to relief \nthat is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim is \nplausible on its face “when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the \nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  “Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by \nmere conclusory statements, do not suffice.”  Id. \n2 of 8 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 65   Filed 02/18/14   Page 3 of 8 PageID #:  1541\nIII.  Analysis \nSignal moves to dismiss the Plaintiffs’ pendent state law claims pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6) because “the [c]omplaint alleges that the facts from which they originate” \noccurred abroad.  (Doc. No. 13, p. 1.)  In addition, Signal asserts the Plaintiffs failed to identify \nwhich state’s laws apply to their claims.  (Id. pp. 8-11.)  Although not entirely clear, Signal also \nseems  to  contend  that  the  complaint  should  be  dismissed  because  the  Plaintiffs  failed  to \nmeaningfully engage in a choice-of-law analysis in order to determine which, if any, state’s law \napplies.  (Id.)  Lastly, Signal moves to dismiss the complaint pro tanto1 “to the degree the \n[c]omplaint refers to facts that occurred abroad” with regard to the Plaintiffs’ claims under §§ 1981 \nand 1985.  (Id. pp. 11-14.) \nThe Plaintiffs counter that their complaint adequately alleges facts that their state law \nclaims occurred in Texas and that Texas law applies to their claims.  Specifically, the Plaintiffs \nargue  the  complaint  makes  clear  that  the  tortious  actions  originated,  were  performed,  and \ncontinued to occur in Texas, specifically at the Texas Labor Camp located in Orange, Texas.  \n(Doc. No. 22.)  Furthermore, the Plaintiffs complain that Signal’s fixation on the supposed \n“foreign character” of their allegations misstates the complaint and offers no plausible grounds for \ndismissing their common law claims.  (Id.)  Lastly, the Plaintiffs argue that a fact intensive \nchoice of law analysis is premature given the sufficient facts that plausibly support the events \ncentered around the Texas Labor Camp.  (Id.) \n1.  State Law Claims Only Occurred Abroad \nSignal’s argument that  the complaint should be dismissed because the alleged  facts \nunderlying the state law claims only occurred abroad is without merit.  The complaint is replete \n                                         \n  1.   Pro Tanto: To that extent; for so much; as far as it goes Black’s Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009), available \nat Westlaw BLACK. \n \n3 of 8 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 65   Filed 02/18/14   Page 4 of 8 PageID #:  1542\nwith allegations that Signal committed the state law torts in Texas.  The following is a summary \nof the Plaintiffs’ complaint (Doc. No. 1):   \nThe Plaintiffs were recruited by Signal and its recruiters, both in the \nUnited States and abroad, to work at Signal’s Texas Labor Camp.  \nSignal and its recruiters contracted with the Plaintiffs to obtain \npermanent residence and immigration status in the United States \nwithin eighteen to twenty-four months.  The Plaintiffs accepted \nSignal’s offer, paid their fees, and were transported to the Texas \nLabor Camp in the United States to perform work for Signal.  Once \nat  the  Texas  Labor  Camp,  Signal  ratified  the  actions  of  the \nrecruiters, and breached its obligations and defrauded the Plaintiffs \nregarding their immigration status upon their arrival.  In the Texas \nLabor  Camp,  Signal  personnel  held  various  meetings  with  the \nPlaintiffs to discuss the status of the Plaintiffs’ visas and green card \napplications.  Signal again promised the same visa extensions and \ngreen cards for the Plaintiffs as when they were recruited abroad.  \nHowever, Signal continued to breach its contracts with the Plaintiffs \nby  failing  to  comply  with  their  binding  promises  regarding \npermanent  residence  and  immigration  status.  Signal  and  its \nrecruiters  knowingly  or  negligently  made  materially  false  and \nuntrue statements and representations to Plaintiffs regarding the \nnature and terms and conditions of applications and opportunities \nfor  immigration  status  and  employment  in  the  United  States.  \nSignal intended that the false statements made by Signal and its \nrecruiters would induce Plaintiffs to pay them exorbitant fees and \nremain as Texas Labor Camp under deplorable conditions.   \n \nWhen deciding a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the court must consider these facts as true.  \nIn re Katrina Beaches Litig., 495 F.3d at 205.  From these allegations, the Plaintiffs have clearly \npleaded enough factual content to draw the reasonable inference that the alleged pendent state law \nclaims of fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract occurred in Texas.  Iqbal, 556 \nU.S. 662 at 678.   \n2.  Complaint Fails to Identify Which State’s Laws Apply \nNext, Signal argues the state law claims are subject to dismissal because the complaint fails \nto identify which state’s law applies.  (Doc. No. 13, pp. 10-11.)  Signal also argues the complaint \n4 of 8 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 65   Filed 02/18/14   Page 5 of 8 PageID #:  1543\nis defective because it does not address the factors that would convince the court that Texas state \nlaw, for example, applies.  (Id.)    \nA court has discretion to exercise jurisdiction over state-law claims when federal question \njurisdiction is proper and the state-law claims derive from a common nucleus of operative facts.  \nArena v. Graybar Elec. Co., Inc., 669 F.3d 214, 221 (5th Cir. 2012); 28 U.S.C. § 1367.  Federal \ncourts apply the forum state’s conflict-of-law rules to determine what law governs the state-law \nclaims.  Bailey v. Shell Western E&P, Inc., 609 F.3d 710, 722 (5th Cir. 2010), citing Klaxon Co. \nv. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 496 (1941).  Texas courts first determine whether there is \na conflict between Texas law and another potentially applicable law.  Id. (citation omitted.)  If \nthere is no such conflict, a choice-of-law analysis is unnecessary.  Id. (citing SAVA gumarska in \nkemijska  industria  d.d.  v.  Advanced  Polymer  Sciences,  Inc.,  128  S.W.3d  304,  314  (Tex. \nApp.—Dallas 2004, no pet.)).  But, where there is a conflict of laws, Texas follows the “most \nsignificant relationship” test of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws.  Id. (citing  Minn. \nMining & Mfg. Co. v. Nishika Ltd., 953 S.W.2d 733, 735 (Tex. 1997)).    \nSignal does not dispute the court has proper federal question jurisdiction over the pendent \nstate-law claims.  Signal only argues the complaint is subject to dismissal because it does not \nexplicitly identify which state’s laws apply.  While courts have granted 12(b)(6) motions by \napplying a particular state’s substantive law under the “most significant relationship” test,2 Signal \ndoes not cite, and the undersigned cannot find, any binding Fifth Circuit authority for a 12(b)(6) \ndismissal because the complaint fails to plead the particular state’s law at issue for the pendent \nstate law claims.  Nevertheless, Signal has not shown there is even a conflict of laws between \n                                         \n  2.  See Signal Reply Brief, (Doc. No. 24, pp. 44-5), and cases cited. \n \n5 of 8 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 65   Filed 02/18/14   Page 6 of 8 PageID #:  1544\nTexas and any other potentially applicable law.3  Without such a showing, a choice-of-law \nanalysis is unnecessary.  Even if a choice-of-law analysis were required, there is no authority for \ndismissing a complaint under 12(b)(6) for failing to analyze in the complaint which state law \ncontrols under the “most significant relationship” test promulgated in the Restatement (Second) of \nConflict of Laws.  In any event, Signal’s choice-of-law argument is irrelevant.  As discussed \npreviously, the Plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts to draw the reasonable inference that Signal’s \nalleged misconduct occurred in Texas, thereby invoking Texas law to govern the state causes of \naction. \n3.  Pro Tanto Dismissal \nFinally, Signal moves to dismiss the complaint pro tanto “to the degree the [c]omplaint \nrefers to facts that occurred abroad” with regard to the Plaintiffs’ claims under §§ 1981 and 1985.  \nSignal begins with the premise that §§ 1981 and 1985 claims are not extraterritorial.  Signal \nwould then like the court to compare the complaint in this suit with 1) the first amended complaint4 \nin David et al. v. Signal, Int’l, L.L.C. et. al. and 2) one sentence in the David court’s order5 \ndenying class certification concerning what damages are attributable to the David plaintiffs’ \ndiscrimination claims.  Signal argues this comparison would show that at least part of the \nPlaintiffs’ §§ 1981 and 1985 claims in this case occurred abroad.  Thus, Signal requests a pro \ntanto dismissal of the complaint to the degree the §§ 1981 and 1985 claims refer to facts that \noccurred abroad. \n                                         \n  3.  Signal argues in its reply brief (without any citation) that “under the Indian Contracts Act, and the \njurisprudence construing it, a contract cannot be enforced if its enforcement would violate the law or public policy of \nIndia.”  (Doc. No. 24, p.6.)  Signal has not shown to what extent this conflicts with Texas law, why Indian law would \nbe applied under the “most significant relationship test,” or why the Plaintiffs’ state law claims should be dismissed for \nfailing to undergo this analysis in the complaint. \n   \n  4.  David v. Signal Int’l, L.L.C., Civ. A. No. 08-1220 (E.D. La.) (Doc. No. 47). \n \n  5.  David et al. v. Signal, Int’l, L.L.C. et. al., Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247 (E.D. La. \nJan. 3, 2012). \n6 of 8 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 65   Filed 02/18/14   Page 7 of 8 PageID #:  1545\n In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court typically does not look beyond the \ncomplaint.    However,  a  court  may  consider  attachments  to  briefing  if  the  documents  are \nreferenced  in  the  complaint,  central  to  the  complaint,  referenced  by  the  parties,  and  their \nauthenticity is not in dispute.  See Walch v. Adjutant Gen. Dep’t, 533 F.3d 289, 293–94 (5th Cir. \n2008) (citing In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007)); Causey v. \nSewell Cadillac-Chevrolet, Inc., 394 F.3d 285, 288 (5th Cir. 2004).  While the David litigation \nwas casually mentioned in the complaint (Doc. No 1, pp. 3, 6), the David first amended complaint \nand the David court’s order denying class certification are not central to the Plaintiffs’ complaint in \nthis case.  Furthermore, Signal failed to include the documents in its briefing to this court.  \nObviously, without being able to consider the David court documents, Signal’s motion should not \nbe granted on this basis.   \nIV.  Recommendation \n  For the reasons stated above, the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 13) should be \ndenied. \nV.

Plaintiffs (as defined below) and approxi mately 590 Indian men, were trafficked \ninto the United States through the federal govern ment’s H-2B guest worker program to provide \nlabor and services (the “Indian H-2B W orkers”) to Defendants Signal  International L.L.C., \nSignal International, Inc., Signal International Texas, L.P., a nd Signal International Texas, G.P. \n(collectively “Signal”).  Recruited to  perform welding, pipefitting, and other m arine fabrication \nwork, Plaintiffs were subjected to forced labo r and other serious abuses at Signal operations in \nOrange, Texas. \n2.  Plaintiffs bring this action to recover  damages inflicted by Signal and Signal’s \nrecruiters and agents operating in India, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and the United \nStates.  Defendants, defined be low, have exploited and defra uded Plaintiffs by fraudulently \nrecruiting them to work in the Unite d States and effectuating a broad schem e of psychological \ncoercion, threats of serious harm and physical restraint, and threatened abuse of the legal process \nto maintain control over Plaintiffs. \n3.  Lured by, and in reliance upon, Defendants’  fraudulent prom ises of legal and \npermanent work-based  imm igration to th e U nited S tates f or them selves and  th eir f amilies, \nPlaintiffs plunged themselves and their fam ilies into debt to take advantage of thes e seemingly \npromising opportunities. Plaintiffs incurred sign ificant debts to pay m andatory recruitm ent, \nimmigration processing, and travel fees char ged by Defendants totaling as m uch as $12,000 to \n2 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 83   Filed 04/23/14   Page 3 of 56 PageID #:  1956\n$20,0001 per worker, equivalent to two to three year s of an Indian welde r’s salary working in  \nIndia.  Trusting the veracity of the immigra tion and work benefits prom ised by Defendants , \nPlaintiffs further relinquished stable employment opportunities in India and as guest workers in \nthe Persian Gulf and Singapore. \n4.  Defendants’ main recruiting agents in I ndia and the United  Arab Emirates held \nPlaintiffs’ passports and visas, and threatened, coerced, and defrauded  Plaintiffs into p aying \nextraordinary fees for recruitm ent, immigration processing, a nd travel.  Several Defendants \nfurther caused Plaintiffs to believe that if th ey did not work for Signal under the auspices of  \ntemporary, Signal-restricted, H-2B  guest worker visas, they woul d suffer abuse or threatened \nabuse of the legal process, physical restraint, or other serious harm. \n5.  The false promises, collection of exorbitant recruiting fees, and strong-arm tactics \nof Signal and its agents were, upon inform ation and belief, authorized by Defendant Signal.   \nDefendant Signal knew of the exorbitant fees charged and the Indian H-2B Workers’ green card \nexpectations by December 2006, before any of Plaintiffs arrived at Signal’s facility.  (Order and \nReasons Denying Class Certification, at 33, Kurian David, et al. v. Signal International, LLC, et \nal., 2:08-cv-01220-SM-DEK, (E.D.  La. Jan. 4, 2012), EC F No. 1117.)  Far from  taking any \ncorrective measures, Defendant Signal ratified  and perpetuated the schem e by continuing to \nfacilitate the transportation of additional waves of Indian H-2B workers,  including Plaintiffs , \nfrom December 2006 through February 2007.   \n                                                 \n1 Payments were made by Plaintiffs in both In dian Rupees and United States Dollars. For th e \npurposes of this Com plaint, all paym ents made in Indian Rupees  discussed throughout the  \nComplaint were converted to United States Dollars.   An exchange rate of 45 Indian Rupees to 1 \nUnited States Dollar was utilized as the approximate exchange rate for the relevant period.   \n3 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 83   Filed 04/23/14   Page 4 of 56 PageID #:  1957\n6.  Upon Plaintiffs’ arrival in the United  States, Defendant Signal required that \nPlaintiffs live in a guarded, overcrowded, and isolated labor camp located in Orange, Texas (the \n“Texas Labor Cam p”).  Defendants further d eceived Plaintiffs regarding their visa sta tus, \nthreatened Plaintiffs with arrest, loss of i mmigration status and deportation, and generally \nperpetrated a campaign of psychological abuse, coercion, and fraud designed to render Plaintiffs \nafraid, intimidated, and unable to leave Signal’s employ.  \n7.  Defendant Signal subjected Pl aintiffs to discriminatory and offensive mandatory \nroom and board arrangements at the Texas Labor  Camp to which non-Indian and United States  \ncitizen employees were not subjected.  More over, Defendant Signal  imposed upon Plaintiffs  \ndiscriminatory job-related requirem ents and ad verse terms and conditions of e mployment on \nPlaintiffs to which non-Indian and United S tates citizen em ployees were not subjected.   \nDefendant Signal subjected Plaintiffs to an objectively hostile and abusive work environment on \naccount of Plaintiffs’ race and alienage. \n8.  Plaintiffs assert claims against Defendants arising from violat ions of their rights \nunder the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act  (“TVPA”) (18 U.S.C. § 1581, et \nal.; the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Orga nizations Act (“RICO”); the Civil Rights Act of \n1866 (42 U.S.C. § 1981); the Ku Klux Klan Ac t of 1871 (42 U.S.C. § 1985); the Declaratory \nJudgment Act (28 U.S.C. §2201); the Federal Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”) (29 U.S.C. §201, et \nseq.); and claim s for dam ages arising from  fraud, negligent m isrepresentation, and breach of \ncontract.  \n \n4 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 83   Filed 04/23/14   Page 5 of 56 PageID #:  1958\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.

Acting as Defendant Signal’s recruiting agent for the purposes of facilitating the \nrecruitment of Indian H -2B Workers for em ployment at Signal, Recruiter Defendants placed \nadvertisements in newspapers throughout India and the United Arab Em irates in the spring, \nsummer, and fall of 2006 offering opportunities  for welders and pipefitters to imm igrate \npermanently to the United States under the auspices of Signal, “a leading marine and fabrication \ncompany in Mississippi and Texas.”  Plaintiffs were targeted for recruitment on the basis of their \nrace or alienage.   \n73.  Recruiter Defendants’ advertisements and other recruiting efforts were undertaken \non behalf of, at the direction of, or in coordi nation and consultation with Defendant Signal and \nBurnett Defendants. \n74.  Recruiter D efendants’ advertisem ents  and other recruiting  efforts prom ised \n“permanent residency” or “green cards.” \n75.  In response to the advertisem ents poste d by Recruiter Defenda nts, Plaintiffs \ncontacted Recruiter Defendants in the spring,  summer and fall of 2006  via telephone and in-\nperson meetings. \n76.  Specific facts relevan t to the experiences  of Plaintiffs are se t forth in the table  \nattached as Exhibit 1 to this Complaint, which are incorporated herein by reference. \n77.  Upon information and belief, Defendant Si gnal’s direction and coordination of \nRecruiter Defendants’ and Burnett Defendants’ recruitment efforts were effectuated by the use of \n15 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 83   Filed 04/23/14   Page 16 of 56 PageID #:  1969\nnumerous telephone, fax, e-mail, or mail communications that occurred from the spring of 2006 \nthrough at least January 2007. \n78.  Upon inform ation and belief, in th ese communications Defendant Signal \nauthorized Recruiter Defendants and Burnett Defendants to act as their agents for the purposes of \nrecruiting and providing Indian welders and pipefitters to fill anticipated H-2B guest worker jobs \nat Signal’s Orange, Texas operations. \n79.  Upon information and belief, in these co mmunications, Defendant Signal further \nauthorized Recruiter Defendants and Burnett Defendants to represent that Signal would agree to \nsponsor bona fide green card applications for Plaintiffs  and obtain at least two H-2B visa \nextensions on behalf of Plaintiffs to allow them to remain in the United States working for Signal \nwhile their green card applications were being processed. \n80.  Defendant Signal authorized these repr esentations even though it knew or had \nreason to know that such vi sa extensions and green card  applications would not be  bona fide, \nvalid, or lawful under United States imm igration law and even though Signal did not have the \nintention at that time to apply for visa extensions or green cards on behalf of all the Indian H-2B \nWorkers, including Plaintiffs. \n81.  At the latest, Defendant Signal knew th at the H-2B W orkers paid exorbitant \nrecruitment fees to Signal’s agents – Recruiter Defendants and Burnett Defendants – and m ade \nthose payments on the basis of p romises, namely that the workers wo uld receive green cards, \nwhich Signal knew to be false.  Defendant Si gnal nonetheless continue d to  f acilitate the \ntransportation, to Signal worksites in Texas an d Mississippi, of hundreds m ore Indian H-2B \nWorkers, including Plaintiffs, because it was in Signal’s financial interest to do so. \n16 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 83   Filed 04/23/14   Page 17 of 56 PageID #:  1970\n82.  In the spring, summer, and fall of 2006, Pl aintiffs attended m eetings at which \nRecruiter Defendants and Burnett Defendants, actin g on Signal’s behalf, info rmed Plaintiffs of \nthe opportunity to work for Defendant Signal on H- 2B visas which were represented to lead to \npermanent resident (green card) status. \n83.  Upon infor mation and belief, prior to attending these m eetings and testing \nsessions (discussed in paragraphs 91 to 95 below), Defendant Signa l, Recruiter Defendants, and \nBurnett Defendants conferred in the spring, su mmer, and fall of 2006 by phone, m ail, fax or e-\nmail to organize, plan, and coordinate the logistics and substantive content of these meetings. \n84.  The United  States -based Recruiter De fendants (Pol and Global), Burnett \nDefendants, and Defendant Signal traveled across state and international lines to attend meetings \nwith Plaintiffs in India and the United Arab Emirates in the spring, summer, and fall of 2006. \n85.  According to the statem ents made at  these meeting s and in comm unications \neffected by wire and mail during this tim e period, Defendant Signal repr esented that it would \nsponsor Plaintiffs’ green card applications and extend their H-2B  visas multiple times to enable \nPlaintiffs to work in the United States while  their green card applications were pending. In \nexchange, each Plaintiff was required to pay fe es totaling as m uch as 8 lakh rupees ($20,000), \neach in a series of approximately three installments. \n86.  Plaintiffs were furthe r inform ed by  Recruiter Defendants and/or Burnett  \nDefendants that Plaintiffs would be able to obtain le gal permanent residence for their spouses \nand children. \n87.  At informational meetings and in telephone  conversations, faxes, contracts, and \nother written documents transmitted through the use of mail and wire communications occurring \n17 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 83   Filed 04/23/14   Page 18 of 56 PageID #:  1971\nduring the spring, sum mer and fall of 2006, Recr uiter Defendants and Burnett Defendants, \npersonally or through their agents, representatives,  or employees, represented to Plaintiffs that: \nDefendant Signal would provide lawful, stable , and ample employment opportunities; working \nunder an H-2B visa for Signal was not inconsis tent with applying for perm anent immigration \nstatus sponsored by Signal; a nd, Signal would obtain for P laintiffs work-authorized green cards \nenabling Plaintiffs to permanently and legally reside in the United States with their families. \n88.  In such co mmunications with Plainti ffs, Recruiter Def endants and Burnett \nDefendants further promised to ac t diligently and to do everything nece ssary to ensure that  \nPlaintiffs would obtain green cards within 24 months of initiating the green-card process. \n89.  In reasonable reliance upon these and ot her contractually-binding promises made \nto them regarding green cards and work opport unities in the United Stat es, Plaintiffs signed \ngreen card contracts at various points from  mid-2006 to early 2007 with Recruiter Defendants  \nand Burnett Defendants pursuant to which Plainti ffs promised to pay the fees charged by these \nDefendants. \n90.  Contracts signed by Plaintiffs and other  documents provided to Plaintiffs by \nBurnett Defendants and Recruiter Defendants thr ough the use of m ail or wire transm issions in \nand around m id-2006 through at  least early 2007, further prom ised that Plaintiffs would \npromptly receive a refund of all  or nearly all of their pay ments if these Defendants did no t \nsucceed in securing green cards for Plaintiffs, as promised. \n91.  Burnett Defendants and  Recruiter Defendants kne w or should have known, \nhowever, that they would not refund Plaintiffs’  money as prom ised in the contracts and other \ndocuments. \n18 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 83   Filed 04/23/14   Page 19 of 56 PageID #:  1972\n92.  Burnett Defendants and Recruiter Defendants induced Plaintiffs to enter the green \ncard contracts even th ough such defendants did  not intend to pursue diligen tly Plaintiffs’ \napplications and without any basis whatsoever fo r representing, inter alia, that Defendant Signal \nhad lawful long-term employment opportunities to  provide Plaintiffs; that Signal could legally \napply for numerous H-2B visa extensions to main tain Plaintiffs’ presence in the United State s; \nthat working under an H-2B visa for Signal w as not inconsistent with applying for perm anent \nimmigration status sponsored by Signal; that green card applications sponsored by Signal would \nbe valid and bona fide under U.S. immigration law; and that such applications were likely to be \nsuccessfully completed and approved within the promised timelines. \n93.  In reasonable reliance on Recruiter Defendants’ and Burnett Defendants’ explicit \nand repeated promises regarding the procurement of green cards and employm ent opportunities \nin the United States, Plaintiffs undertook considerable economic, personal and familial sacrifices, \nincluding the mortgaging or sale of personal property and other  incurrence of debt, in order to \namass the funds necessary to initiate the green card process with Defendant Signal. \n94.  In reasonab le reliance on the pro mises  of Recruiter Def endants and Burnett \nDefendants, Plaintiffs signed contracts with th ese Defendants and m ade the payments required \nby these contracts. \n95.  Plaintiffs would not have paid the f ees charged by Recruiter Defendants and  \nBurnett Defendants for green cards, visas, a nd employment opportunities had they known that \nthese Defendants’ promises and representations were false. \n96.  Plaintiffs would not have paid the f ees charged by Recruiter Defendants and  \nBurnett Defendants for green cards, visas, a nd employment opportunities had they known that \n19 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 83   Filed 04/23/14   Page 20 of 56 PageID #:  1973\nthese Defendants had f ailed to dis close material facts con cerning the nature and  terms and \nconditions of the purported immigration and work opportunities offered. \nDeparture for Signal Operations in the United States \n97.  At various tim es during  the spring, summ er, and fall of  2006, em ployees of \nDefendant Signal traveled to various locations in India and the Un ited Arab Emirates and tested \nPlaintiffs’ welding and pipefitting skills in anticipation of employing them in the United States. \n98.  Plaintiffs paid costs necessary to travel to the cities where these tests were held. \n99.  Plaintiffs paid admission fees in order to take these tests. \n100.  Plaintiffs attended and passe d these tests, which were ov erseen and graded by  \nDefendant Signal’s or Defendant Dewan’s agents, employees, or representatives. \n101.  Upon infor mation and belief, prior to attending these m eetings and testing \nsessions, D efendant Signal, Recruiter Defendant s, and B urnett Defendants conferred in the \nspring, summer, and fall of 2006 by phone, mail, fax or e-mail to organize, plan, and coordinate \nthe logistics and substantive content of these testing sessions. \n102.  On or about July 20, 2006 and August  17, 2006, the United States Department of \nLabor approved Signal’s labor certification applications for 590 H-2B workers for the period of \nOctober 1, 2006 through July 31, 2007. \n103.  In approving these labor certification applications, the United States Department \nof Labor relied on the accuracy of the applicants’ stated 10-month period of labor need. \n104.  On information and belief, the Departm ent of Labor is proh ibited by its internal \nguidelines from  granting labor certification ap plications without relying on the applicants’ \nstatement of temporary labor need. \n20 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 83   Filed 04/23/14   Page 21 of 56 PageID #:  1974\n105.  In late August and early Septem ber  2006, the United S tates Citizenship and \nImmigration Service (“USCIS”) approved Signal’s H-2B visa petitions for 590 H-2B workers for \nthe period of October 1, 2006 through July 31, 2007. \n106.  In approving these visa petitions, the  USCIS relied on the purported accuracy of \nthe applicants’ stated 10-m onth period of labor  need and the representation that Defendant \nSignal’s need was based on a one time peak-load temporary demand. \n107.  The USCIS m ust, according to regulation,  rely on the stated perio d of the \npetitioner’s labor need, see 8 C.F.R. 214.2(h)(6)(ii)(B) (2006). \n108.  Defendant Signal, Burnett Defendants,  and Recruiter Defendants knew that the \nstated period of need in Signa l’s applications for labor certifications and for H-2B visas were  \ninconsistent with Sign al’s projected actual labor need, and therefore Defendants knew these \nstatements to the United States Government were false. \n109.  Recruiter Defendants and Burnett Defendants used the H-2B visas, obtained from \nthe U.S. Governm ent on the basis of false statem ents by Defendant Signal and Burnett \nDefendants, to elicit certain payments from Plaintiffs. \n110.  Plaintiffs entered the United States  on H- 2B guest worker visas, issued by th e \nUnited States Government on the basis of fals e statements made by Defendant Signal and \nBurnett Defendants, in late 2006 and early 20 07 for the purposes of working for Defendant \nSignal at its Texas Labor Camp. \n111.  Around the time of USCIS visa ap proval, Plaintiffs made necessary preparations \nto travel to the United States on H-2B visas  to work for  Signal, including: paying to obtain \nnecessary travel and legal documents; making payments to the United States consulate, Recruiter \n21 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 83   Filed 04/23/14   Page 22 of 56 PageID #:  1975\nDefendants and Burnett Defendants for m andatory H-2B visa and consular processing fees; \nattending H-2B visa interviews; and paying Recruiter Defendants for travel arrangements. \n112.  In order to secure H-2B  visas to work  for Signal, Plaintiffs were interviewed by \nrepresentatives of the United States Consular offices in Indian cities. \n113.  These consular interviews necessitated that Plaintiffs pay the costs of travel from \ntheir homes or current places of  employment to various large In dian cities in cluding Chennai \n(Madras) and Mumbai (Bombay).  \n114.  Recruiter Defendants or Burnett Defendants, acting as Defendant Signal’s agents, \nrequired that Plain tiffs meet with Recruiter D efendants or Burnett Defe ndants in these Indian \ncities prior to attending their consular interviews. \n115.  Upon information and belief, prior to th ese meetings, Recruiter Defendants and \nBurnett Defendants discussed am ong them selves and w ith Defendant Signal by e-m ail, \ntelephone, or in-person communications the topics to be discussed and instructions to be given to \nPlaintiffs at these meetings. \n116.  At these pre-interview meetings, Recruiter Defendants and  Burnett Defendants \nensured that Plaintiffs were up-to-date on paying the fee installments required by their green card \ncontracts. \n117.  Defendants further requ ired that Plaintiffs pay an additio nal 35,000 to 45,000  \nrupees ($800 to $1,100) fee for H-2B visa processing. \n118.  Recruiter Defendants or Burnett Defendants required Plaintiffs to sign documents \npermitting Defendant Dewan to receive their visa -stamped passports from  the Consulate o n \nPlaintiffs’ behalf. \n22 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 83   Filed 04/23/14   Page 23 of 56 PageID #:  1976\n119.  Recruiter Defendants or Burnett Defendants  also coached Plaintiffs on what to  \nsay during consular interviews. \n120.  Recruiter Defendants or Burnett Defendants  told Plaintiffs that if they did not \nfollow these ins tructions regarding the in terviews, Plaintiffs would not  receive their visas and \nwould forfeit all of the money they had previously paid to Defendants, in addition to losing their \nopportunity to permanently immigrate to the United States. \n121.  During Plaintiffs’ consular interviews, th e consular official s took Plaintiffs’  \npassports from them. \n122.  Once Plaintiffs’ visas were approved, consul ar officials sent their passports, with \nH-2B visas affixed, directly to Defendant Dewan. \n123.  After receiving word th at Plaintiffs’ visas were approved, Recruiter Defendants  \nmade travel arrangements for Plaintiffs’ departures to the United States. \n124.  Before Plaintiffs could  leav e for the Un ited States,  however, Plain tiffs were \nrequired to attend final meetings in Recruiter Defendants’ office. \n125.  Such m eetings typically  took place m ere hours before  Plaintiffs’ scheduled \ndepartures to the United States, when Recruite r Defendants’ office was teem ing with anxious \nfellow Indian H-2B Workers awaiting departure to the United States. \n126.  At these meetings, Recruiter Defendants collected final installm ent paym ents \nrequired by Plaintiffs’ green card contracts. \n127.  Recruiter Defendants also required that Plaintiffs, most of whom do not or did not \nat the time read or speak English proficiently, sign English language documents with little or no \ntime for review, and did not allow Plaintiffs to keep a copy of the documents. \n23 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 83   Filed 04/23/14   Page 24 of 56 PageID #:  1977\n128.  Recruiter Defendants refused to return Plaintiffs’ passports — which had been in \nDefendant Dewan’s possession since Plaintiffs’ H-2B visas were  approved by consular officials \n— until af ter Plaintiffs had paid the f inal installments of their f ees and signed m andatory \npaperwork. \n129.  In forceful tones, Recruiter Defendants  or their staff de manded that Plaintiffs  \nquickly sign the m andatory documents, lest they miss the f lights to the  United Sta tes, which \nRecruiter Defendants had scheduled for them and forfeit the fees they had paid. \n130.  Without possession of their passports  and within this ru shed and hostile \natmosphere, Plaintiffs had no reasonable opportun ity to review, negotiate, or m ake any changes \nto the documents presented them. \n131.  On occasions when workers who appeared at the Mumbai office failed to present \nsufficient funds to pay the final installm ent required by the green card  contracts, Defendant \nDewan and his associates threatened to destroy or deface these workers’ passports. \n132.  Such threats were uttered in the presence of other workers, causing these workers \nto reasonably believe that they had no choice but to pay their final fee installments in full. \n133.  Based on Recruiter Defendants’ threateni ng and coercive beha vior during these \npre-departure meetings in Mumbai and the extraordinary and increasing levels of debt they had \nincurred to pay Recruiter Defendants and Burn ett Defendants for green card and H-2B visa \narrangements, Plaintiffs reasonably believed that they had no choice but to m ake the payments \nrequired by Recruiter Defendants and to travel to the United States to work for Defendant Signal.  \nNot until P laintiffs had f ulfilled all of  Def endants’ r equirements did Plaintif fs have their  \npassports and visas returned to them. \n24 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 83   Filed 04/23/14   Page 25 of 56 PageID #:  1978\n134.  Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B Worker s traveled from M umbai to Defendant \nSignal’s operations in the U.S. at va rious times from late October 2006 to April 2007 on tickets \narranged by Recruiter Defendants. \n135.  Defendant Signal collected Plaintiffs  at the Houston airport upon arrival and \ntransported them immediately to the Texas Labor Camp. \n136.  Pursuant to Defendant Signal’s instructions and arrangements, approximately 300 \nworkers were sent to Signal’s Pascagoula, Miss issippi facility (the “M ississippi Labor Ca mp” \nand collectively with the Texas L abor Cam p, the “Labor Cam ps”) and approxim ately 290 \nworkers were sent to the Texas Labor Camp upon arrival in the United States. \n137.  Plaintiffs had no choice but  to use Recruiter Defendants and Burnett Defendants \nto secure employment at Defendant Signal’s operations. \n138.  Plaintiffs had no choice but  to pay the fees charged by Recruiter Defendants and \nBurnett Defendants to secure employment at Defendant Signal’s operations. \n139.  Management personnel at Defendant Si gnal made the conscious and deliberate \ndecision to prohibit Plaintiffs from  securing employment at Signal’s oper ations either through \nanother recruiter or by bypassing recruiters altogether and applying directly with Signal. \nConditions at the Texas Labor Camp \n140.  Upon arrival at Defendant Signal’s Texas Labor Camp, Plaintiffs were shocked to \ndiscover that they were expected  to live in an  isolated, overcrowded labor cam p comprised of \ntrailer-like bunkhouses surrounded   by barbed-wire fences,  and accessible only b y a single, \nguarded entrance. \n25 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 83   Filed 04/23/14   Page 26 of 56 PageID #:  1979\n141.  Defendant Signal’s Texas Labor Camp was lo cated in an isolated, industrial area \nmiles removed from s hopping areas, places of  worship, public transpor tation or residential \ncommunities.   \n142.  Initially, there were no telephones and no internet access available for Plaintiffs to \ncommunicate outside of the Texas Labor Camp. \n143.  Initially, there were no telev isions available for Plaintiffs to keep apprised of \nevents outside of the Texas Labor Camp. \n144.  The Texas Labor Camp gates were cons tantly m onitored by security guards \nretained by Defendant Signal.  Signal’s security guards monitored Plaintiffs’ comings and goings \nby requiring them to show their employee identi fication badges and recording when Plaintiffs  \nentered and exited the Texas Labor Cam p. Signal’s security guards also search ed Plaintiffs’ \npackages and bags when they entered the Texas Labor Camp. \n145.  Except on rare occasions, Plaintiffs were not pe rmitted to receive visitors in the \nTexas Labor Camp. \n146.  Up to twenty-four men were housed in each bunkhouse and made to sleep in two-\ntiered bunk beds.  The bunk beds were so tightly  packed in the bunkhouses that it w as difficult \nfor workers to m ove about in the narrow passa geways between bunks or sit up in bed.  These \nhousing conditions violated OSHA regulations. \n147.  The Texas Labor Ca mp bunkhouses had insufficient to ilet and bathing facilities \nfor twenty-four men, one or two toilets per bunkhous e, resulting in long lines for the bathroom s \nbefore and after work shifts and unsanitary conditions due to unresolved plumbing problems that \nrendered the toilets inoperable. \n26 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 83   Filed 04/23/14   Page 27 of 56 PageID #:  1980\n148.  Privacy was non-existent, and Plaintiffs  often experienced extrem e difficulty \nsleeping due to the constant noise resulting from  the close quarters and the com ings and goings \nof workers who worked on different shifts. \n149.  Defendant Signal’s personnel and security  guards conducted surprise searches of \nthe dormitory areas of the bunkhouses, including searches of workers’ personal belongings. \n150.  Plaintiffs took their m eals in Defenda nt Signal’s m ess halls, which were only \nopen during limited hours. Due to unhygienic kitche n conditions, Plaintiffs frequently became \nill, sometimes requiring hospitalization. \n151.  Upon inform ation and belief, Defendant  Signal did not obtain the required \npermit(s) to furnish board at the Texas Labor  Camp, and the condition and sanitation of the  \nboard provided further violated federal, state, and/or local law including, inter alia, the U.S. Food \nand Drug Adm inistration Food Code 2005 2, as adopted and m odified by Texas Food \nEstablishment Rules.  25 Tex. Admin. Code. §§229.161 – 229.171, 229.173-229.175.  \n152.  Defendant Signal deducted labor camp f ees of approximately $35 per day ($245 \nper week, or approximately $1,050 per month) from Plaintiffs’ paychecks for these substandard \naccommodations and meals. \n153.  When Plaintiffs complained and asked to live outside th e Texas Labor Cam p, \nDefendant Signal initially refused and subsequently told workers that if they tried to live outside \nthe Texas Labor Camp Defendant Signal would still deduct the labor camp fees from Plaintiffs’ \nwages. As a result, Plaintiffs reasonably believed they had no choice but  to continue living in \nDefendant Signal’s Texas Labor Camp. \n                                                 \n2 Available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/food/guidanceregulation/ucm123926.pdf. \n27 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 83   Filed 04/23/14   Page 28 of 56 PageID #:  1981\n154.  Defendant Signal only housed Indian H-2B Workers such as Plaintiffs in its Labor \nCamps, which other employees and m anagement at  Signal referred to  as the “res ervation(s)”.  \nUpon information and belief, United States citizens and other workers of non-Indian descent and \nnon-Indian race were n either required nor allo wed to live in o r pay for accommodations  in \nSignal’s Texas Labor Camp. \n155.  Defendant Signal subjected Pl aintiffs to skills testing  and re-testing, on-the-job \ndiscipline, layoffs, periods witho ut work, l ack of safety precau tions, unfav orable job \nassignments, evaluation processes, and other a dverse employment actions to which non-Indian \nand United States citizen workers were not similarly subjected. \n156.  In addition, Defendant Signal’s Texas  Labor Camp personnel and supervisors \nfrequently used offensive language while speaking with or referring to Plaintiffs and other Indian \nH-2B Workers, and regularly insulted Plaintiffs on the basis of their race or alienage.  \n157.  During the first week  of employing Plaintiffs in th e United States, D efendant \nSignal did not reimburse Plaintiffs for any of the  expenses that Plaintiffs were required to incur \nas a pre-condition of seeking employment with Signal. \n158.  During the first two we eks of employing Plaintiffs, De fendant Signal deducted \napproximately $100 to $200 each week from  Plaintiffs’ checks for job-related to ol kits which \nSignal required Plaintiffs to purchase from Signal. \n159.  Defendant Signal personnel and m anagement regularly threatened Plain tiffs and \nother Indian H-2B Workers that if they did not continue worki ng for Defendant Signal, did not \nwork according to Defendant Signal’s specifications, or complained about the working or living \nconditions, Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B Workers would be deported back to India. \n28 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 83   Filed 04/23/14   Page 29 of 56 PageID #:  1982\n160.  In the iso lated and guarded atm osphere of the Texas Labor Cam p and saddled \nwith the crushing debts they had incurred to  come to the United States in reliance upon the \nDefendants’ representatives, Plaintiffs reasonably believed Signal’s statements were threatening \nand believed they had no choice but to continue  working for Signal despite deplorable working \nand living conditions. \n161.  At regular m eetings and in one-on-one  or sm all group conversations with \nDefendant Signal’s Texas Labor Ca mp pers onnel and m anagement, som e workers voiced \ncomplaints regarding the discrim inatory trea tment to which Indian  H-2B Wo rkers were \nsubjected, but to which non-Indian and U.S. citizen workers were not similarly subjected.  \n162.  When De fendant Signal took no action in  response to workers’ complaints, \nnumerous Indian H-2B W orkers living at the  Texas Labor Ca mp, including Plaintiffs, began \nmeeting to discuss how to persuade Defendant  Signal to improve conditions in the Texas Labor \nCamp, and also began meeting with third parties to discuss how best to address their concerns.  \n163.  Upon information and belief, Defendant Si gnal became aware of these m eetings \nbetween workers, including Plaintiffs, and third parties whom Signal believed to be attorneys.  \n164.  Upon information and belief, Defendant Si gnal, through its employees or agents, \ncontacted Recruiter Def endants and Burnett Defe ndants to express its concerns about worker \norganizing efforts and the specific involvement of Plaintiffs.  \n165.  Upon information and belief, during thes e conversations Recruiter D efendants, \nBurnett Defendants, and Defendant Signal reached an agreem ent regarding steps to be taken to \ndiscourage further worker organi zing efforts and to ensure th at the Indian H-2B W orkers \n29 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 83   Filed 04/23/14   Page 30 of 56 PageID #:  1983\ncontinued to work at Signal without com plaint, as well as to prevent the Indian H-2B W orkers \nfrom exercising their legal rights. \n166.  On March 9, 2007, Plaintiffs learned that  Defendant Signal used private security \nguards to raid Signal’s Mississippi Labor Camp.  \n167.  Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B Work ers became increasingly frigh tened and \nconfused by these activities, particularly when word spread that Defendant Signal had locked up \nthe Mississippi Labor Ca mp Indian H-2B  Workers who com plained about the working \nconditions. \n168.  Plaintiffs learned of an I ndian H-2B Worker at the Mississippi Labor Camp who \nattempted suicide, rather than be deported  and face debts he had in curred in India to p ay \nRecruiter Defendants and Burnett Defendants. \n169.  Defendant Signal’s actions on and after  March 9, 2007 at the Mississippi Labor \nCamp significantly intensified the reasonable fears  of Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B Workers \nin the Texas Labor Camp that if they trie d to leave Defendant  Signal’s employ or oppose \nunlawful and coercive employment conditions at Defendant Signal, including by consulting with \ncounsel, they faced the threat of physical restraint, detention, forced deportation, or other serious \nharm or abuses of the legal process.  This r eaction was, upon information and belief, exactly the \nreaction Signal wanted and expected from the Indian H-2B Workers. \n170.  Throughout the spring and summer of 2007, Signal personnel in the Labor Camps \nheld various m eetings with Plaintiffs and other  Indian H-2B Workers to discuss the status of \nPlaintiffs’ and other Indian H-2B Workers’ visas and green card applications. \n30 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 83   Filed 04/23/14   Page 31 of 56 PageID #:  1984\n171.  Defendant Signal officials held a m eeting with the In dian H-2B W orkers, \nincluding Plaintiffs.  Defendant Si gnal indicated that they had se lected Plaintiffs to continu e \nworking, promising visa extensions in July 2007. \n172.  In the summ er of 2007, an Indian H-2B  Worker was arrested by im migration \npolice in a town near th e Texas Labor Camp because his visa had expired.  Plaintiffs knew that \nworker to be one whom Defendant Signal had promised to extend a visa.  Hearing of this arrest, \nPlaintiffs’ fear of leaving the barbed-wire fence that surrounded Texas Labor Camp increased. \n173.  Defendant Signal representatives then m et with Indian H-2B W orkers and told \nthem not to leave the Texas Labor C amp because if anyone ended up in  jail due to immigration \nissues, Defendant Signal would not pay the bond required to release them. \n174.  In meetings and conversa tions in the spring and summ er of 2007, Defendant \nSignal, through its agents and em ployees at the  Texas Labor Camp, continued to promise that \nDefendant Signal would arrange for the H-2B vi sa extensions and green cards originally \npromised Plaintiffs when they were recruited in India and the United Arab Emirates. \n175.  While Defendant Signal promised to arrange for H-2B visa extensions and green \ncards for Plaintiffs, Signal in fact was secretly evaluating all of the Indian H-2B Workers with no \nintention of applying for visa extensions for certain of the Indian H-2B Workers. \n176.  Plaintiffs’ continuing dependence on Defendant Signal for their present and future \nimmigration status, their continuing high levels  of indebtedness, as  well as o ther factors  \nreasonably led Plaintiffs, whose e mployment had not been terminated by Signal, to fear serious \nharm and abuse of the legal process if they left Signal’s employ.  \n31 \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 83   Filed 04/23/14   Page 32 of 56 PageID #:  1985\n177.  Under such circumstances, Plaintiffs reasonably felt like they had no choice but to \ncontinue working for Signal. \n178.  At various  tim es relev ant to P laintiffs’ claim s, Defendant Signal refused to \nconfirm whether valid H-2B  visa extensions had in fact been  obtained for Plaintif fs, coercing \nPlaintiffs to continue w orking for Signal in  the hope that Signal woul d finally resolve their  \nuncertain immigration status. \n179.  Since first contracting with Def endants in India and the United Arab Em irates, \nPlaintiffs have yet to receive from Defendants the promised green cards or permanent residency.  \nDespite clear contractual provisi ons requiring them to do so, R ecruiter Defendants and Burnett \nDefendants have refused to refund any of the fees  Plaintiffs paid to them for unsuccessful green \ncard and visa processing. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nTHE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2003 \nForced Labor (18 U.S.C. § 1589) and 18 U.S.C. § 1590 (trafficking with respect to peonage, \nslavery, involuntary servitude, or forced labor) \nAll Defendants \n180.

' \n  ' \nv.    '   1:13-CV-323 \n  ' \nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL L.L.C., et al.  ' \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE \n \n     This case is assigned to the Honorable Marcia A. Crone, United States District Judge, and is \nreferred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge for all pretrial matters pursuant to a \nReferral Order.  (Doc. No. 5.)  Pending before the undersigned is the “Motion to Dismiss \nPursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) of Malvern C. Burnett, the Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, \nA.P.C., and Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, L.L.C.”  (Doc. No. 38.)  The undersigned has \nconsidered  the  pending  motion  and  the  corresponding  response.    (Doc.  No.  42.)    The \nDefendants’ motion should be denied because 1) the court has personal jurisdiction over the \nDefendants since the RICO statute provides for nationwide service of process; and 2) the court has \nspecific personal jurisdiction over the Defendants given the number of alleged tortious acts \ncommitted by the Defendants both outside and inside Texas that injured the Plaintiffs within \nTexas.   \nI.  Background \nA.  Procedural Background \n  On March 7, 2008, twelve individuals who were allegedly trafficked into the United States \nto work for Defendant Signal filed a putative class action in the Eastern District of Louisiana.  See \nDavid v. Signal Int’l, LLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220 (E.D. La.).  That Court denied class certification \nfor the Plaintiffs’ trafficking, RICO, civil rights and state law contract and fraud claims.   David v. \nSignal Int’l, LLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. Jan. 3, \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 86   Filed 04/30/14   Page 2 of 14 PageID #:  2084\n2012).  As a result of this ruling, on May 21, 2013, the Plaintiffs filed suit in this District against \nthe  following  Defendants:  Signal  International,  L.L.C.,  Signal  International,  Inc.,  Signal \nInternational Texas, G.P., and Signal International Texas, L.P. (hereinafter collectively referred to \nas “Signal”), Malvern C. Burnett, Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, L.L.C., Law Offices of \nMalvern C. Burnett, A.P.C. (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Burnett Defendants”), Global \nResources, Inc., Michael Pol, Sachin Dewan, and Dewan Consultants PVT. LTD. (a/k/a Medtech \nConsultants).  (Doc. No. 1.)  The Plaintiffs allege that some or all of the Defendants violated the \nfollowing federal statutes: 1) The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003; 2) \nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”); 3) The Civil Rights act of 1866; \nand 4) The Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871.  (Id.)  In addition, the Plaintiffs bring state law fraud, \nnegligent misrepresentation and breach of contract claims against all of the Defendants.  (Id. at \n46-48.)  On September 10, 2013, the Burnett Defendants filed the pending motion to dismiss.  \n(Doc. No. 38.)   \nB.  Factual Background    \n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, approximately 590 men, including the Plaintiffs, \nwere allegedly trafficked into the United States through the federal government’s H-2B guest \nworker program to provide services to Signal.  (Doc. No. 1 at 2.)  The Plaintiffs claim that they \nwere lured to work for Signal through fraudulent promises made by the Burnett Defendants and \nothers of legal and permanent work-based immigration to the United States.  (Id.)  Subsequently, \nafter coming to the United States, the Plaintiffs were allegedly subjected to forced labor and other \nserious abuses at Signal’s operations in Orange, Texas.  (Id. at 4.)   \nII.  Jurisdiction \n  The Burnett Defendants move to dismiss the instant case under Federal Rule of Civil \n2 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 86   Filed 04/30/14   Page 3 of 14 PageID #:  2085\nProcedure 12(b)(2) alleging that this court lacks personal jurisdiction over them.  (Doc. No. 38.)  \nRule 12(b)(2) requires a court to dismiss a claim if it does not have personal jurisdiction over the \ndefendant.  Grynberg v. BP P.L.C., 855 F. Supp. 2d 625, 638 (S.D. Tex. 2012); see FED. R. CIV. P. \n12(b)(2).  “When a court rules on a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction without \nholding  an  evidentiary  hearing,  the  party  asserting  jurisdiction  is  required  to  present  facts \nsufficient to constitute a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction to satisfy its burden.”  Duke \nEnergy Int’l, L.L.C. v. Napoli, 748 F. Supp. 2d 656, 678 (S.D. Tex. 2010) (citing Central Freight \nLines Inc. v. APA Transport Corp., 322 F.3d 376, 380 (5th Cir. 2003); Alpine View Co. v. Atlas \nCopco  A.B.,  205  F.3d  208,  214  (5th Cir.  2000)).    “[O]n  a  motion  to  dismiss  for  lack  of \njurisdiction, uncontroverted allegations in the plaintiff’s complaint must be taken as true, and \nconflicts between the facts contained in the parties’ affidavits must be resolved in the plaintiff’s \nfavor for purposes of determining whether a prima facie case for personal jurisdiction exists.”  \nBullion v. Gillespie, 895 F.2d 213, 217 (5th Cir. 1990). \nA.  Nationwide Service of Process under the RICO Statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1965(b) \n  In  their  complaint,  the  Plaintiffs  allege  RICO  claims  against  all  of  the  Defendants, \nincluding the Burnett Defendants.  (Doc. No. 1, pp. 34-43.)  A federal court obtains personal \njurisdiction over a defendant in a suit based upon a federal statute if that statute provides for \nnationwide service of process and the defendant has had minimum contacts with the United States.  \nBusch v. Buchman, Buchman & O’Brien, Law Firm, 11 F.3d 1255, 1258 (5th Cir. 1994).  The \nBurnett Defendants have minimum contacts with the United States.  (See Doc. No. 38, Ex. 1, \nAffidavit of Malvern Burnett.)  Thus, the next issue to be decided is whether the RICO statute \nprovides nationwide service of process.   \n \n3 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 86   Filed 04/30/14   Page 4 of 14 PageID #:  2086\n  Title 18 U.S.C. § 1965 provides, in pertinent part: \n(a) Any civil action or proceeding under this chapter against any \nperson may be instituted in the district court of the United States for \nany district in which such person resides, is found, has an agent, or \ntransacts his affairs. \n(b) In any action under section 1964 [the civil RICO remedies] of \nthis chapter in any district court of the United States in which it is \nshown that the ends of justice require that other parties residing in \nany other district be brought before the court, the court may cause \nsuch parties to be summoned, and process for that purpose may be \nserved in any judicial district of the United States by the marshal \nthereof. \n \nWhile the Fifth Circuit has not yet ruled on this issue, it appears all of the district courts in \nthis Circuit have interpreted § 1965(b) to confer nationwide jurisdiction in a RICO action over \nnonresident  defendants  if  the  plaintiff  can  establish  personal  jurisdiction  over  at  least  one \ndefendant under § 1965(a).  Allstate Ins. Co. v. Plambeck, No. 3-08-cv-0388-M, 2009 WL \n347423, at *3 (N.D. Tex. Feb. 11, 2009) (citing Rolls–Royce Corp. v. Heros, Inc., 576 F.Supp.2d \n765, 778-79 (N.D. Tex. 2008); Oblio Telecom, Inc. v. Patel, No. 3–08–cv–0279–L, 2008 WL \n4936488 at *4 (N.D. Tex. Nov. 18, 2008)); see also Hawkins v. Upjohn Co., 890 F. Supp. 601, 606 \n(E.D. Tex. 1994); Paolino v. Argyll Equities, L.L.C., 401 F. Supp. 2d 712, 719 (W.D. Tex. 2005).  \nFurthermore, the majority of circuit courts have determined that § 1965(b) confers nationwide \nservice of process in RICO cases.  See Allstate Ins. Co., 2009 WL 347423, at *3 n.2 (collecting \ncases).   \nThe Burnett Defendants argue that even if § 1965(b) provides for nationwide service of \nprocess, “the requirements of the constitution and due process must still be fulfilled.”  (Doc. No. \n38, p. 2.)  Thus, the Burnett Defendants argue they have insufficient minimum contacts with \nTexas to justify personal jurisdiction here.  (Id.)  This argument is contrary to Fifth Circuit \nprecedent.  As stated previously, a federal court obtains personal jurisdiction over a defendant in a \n4 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 86   Filed 04/30/14   Page 5 of 14 PageID #:  2087\nsuit based upon a federal statute if that statute provides for nationwide service of process and the \ndefendant  has  had  minimum  contacts  with  the  United  States.    Busch,  11  F.3d  at  1258.  \nAccordingly, the undersigned will follow the majority rule that § 1965(b) of the RICO statute \nprovides for nationwide service of process if the plaintiff can establish personal jurisdiction over at \nleast one defendant under § 1965(a).  That is easily determined here.  In the instant case, it is \nclear that Defendant Signal transacts its affairs in this forum as they have a facility in Orange, \nTexas.   \nHaving decided § 1965(b) provides nationwide service of process, the last inquiry is \nwhether the “ends of justice require” the Burnett Defendants, who reside and conduct business in \nthe Eastern District of Louisiana and Southern District of Mississippi, be brought before the court \nin the Eastern District of Texas.  See 18 U.S.C. § 1965(b) (“In any action under section 1964 of \nthis chapter in any district court of the United States in which it is shown that the ends of justice \nrequire that other parties residing in any other district be brought before the court, the court may \ncause such parties to be summoned . . . .”).  The Burnett Defendants argue that “under the totality \nof the circumstances” and given the speculative allegations against them in the complaint, the \n“ends of justice” do not require they be brought before this court.  Again, the Burnett Defendants \ntake issue with their lack of contacts with Texas, the forum state.  Furthermore, they argue the \nPlaintiffs have failed to plead enough facts in their complaint to show the Burnett Defendants \nengaged in a conspiracy or a scheme to defraud or commit illegal acts subjecting them to the \npersonal jurisdiction of this court.  \nThese are not relevant considerations when deciding whether “the ends of justice” require \nthe Burnett Defendants to be brought to Texas.  To reiterate, when a federal court attempts to \nexercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant in a suit based on a federal statute providing for \n5 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 86   Filed 04/30/14   Page 6 of 14 PageID #:  2088\nnationwide service of process—which is the case here—the relevant inquiry is whether the \ndefendant has sufficient contacts with the United States as a whole, not the forum state.  Busch, 11 \nF.3d 1255, 1258; Adams v. Unione Mediterranea di Sicurta, 364 F.3d 646, 650-51 (5th Cir. 2004).  \nFurthermore, questions of whether the complaint sufficiently pleads violations of the RICO statute \nshould not be raised in a motion under Rule 12(b)(2) challenging personal jurisdiction.  See \nAllstate Ins. Co., 2009 WL 347423, at *4.   \n  “[T]he ‘ends of justice’ is a flexible concept uniquely tailored to the facts of each case.” \nCory v. Aztec Steel Building, Inc., 468 F.3d 1226, 1232 (10th Cir. 2006).  The Fifth Circuit has \nnot implemented any legal test as to what exact set of facts meet “the ends of justice” requirement.  \nSee Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Byd:Sign, Inc., No. 6:05-cv-456, 2006 WL 2822151, at *9 (E.D. Tex. \nSept. 28, 2006).  While courts have used somewhat differing tests, the two considerations that are \nused most frequently are 1) whether no other district court would have personal jurisdiction over \nall of the alleged RICO conspirators1 and 2) judicial economy.2 \nThe “ends of justice” require the Burnett Defendants to answer in this forum because \nnumerous defendants reside in different states, and there is likely no alternative forum in which \njurisdiction would be proper as to all defendants.3  For reasons of judicial economy, the “ends of \njustice” should also require the Burnett Defendants to litigate this suit in Texas.  There are \n                                                 \n  1.  Butcher’s Union Local No. 498 v. SDC Investment, Inc., 788 F.2d 535, 539 (9th Cir.1986). \n \n  2.  Farmers Bank of State of Del. v. Bell Mortg. Corp., 577 F. Supp. 34, 35 (D.C. Del. 1978). \n \n  3.  The various Signal defendants have operations in Texas, Mississippi and Alabama and are organized \nunder the laws of Delaware and Texas; Michael Pol is a Mississippi resident; Global is a Mississippi corporation; \nSachin Dewan is a resident of India while Sachin Consultants conduct operations in India and the United Arab \nEmirates; and Malvern Burnett is a Louisiana resident who practices law there and in Mississippi. (Doc. No. 1, pp. \n9-12.)  Defendants Law Office of Malvern Burnett, APC and Gulf Coast Immigration Center were corporations \norganized under the laws of Louisiana.  (Doc. No. 38, Ex. 1, p. 3.)  \n6 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 86   Filed 04/30/14   Page 7 of 14 PageID #:  2089\ncurrently seventeen plaintiffs in this case and over seventy in the four companion cases.4  Most of \nthese same plaintiffs already have pending FLSA claims in the Eastern District of Louisiana \nstemming from the same allegations.5  (Doc. No. 56.)  This court and the Fifth Circuit have \nalready denied Signal’s vigorous attempts to transfer this case to Louisiana.  (Doc. Nos. 56, 63, \n66); In re: Signal International, L.L.C., et al., No. 14-40313, (5th Cir. April 4, 2014) (court order \ndenying the petition for writ of mandamus in reference to their motion to transfer filed by Signal).  \nThus, it can safely be assumed that approximately ninety plaintiffs will be trying this case here in \nTexas against the lead Defendant Signal and other defendants that have not sought transfer.  If the \nBurnett Defendants were dismissed from this case, most of the plaintiffs in this and the companion \ncases would be litigating their FLSA claims against Signal in Louisiana, all of the plaintiffs would \nbe litigating their RICO, federal law and state law claims against the remaining defendants here, \nand then potentially those same RICO, federal law and state law claims against only the Burnett \nDefendants  would be litigated in  an  entirely different  forum.6  That  would be  contrary to \nCongress’ intent for the “ends of justice” provision which enables plaintiffs to bring all members \nof a nationwide RICO conspiracy before a court in a single trial.  Butcher’s Union, 788 F.2d 535, \n539.  The undersigned also notes that it would be impractical to require roughly ninety plaintiffs \nto travel to a different forum all for the sake of the Burnett Defendants, who consist of a single \nattorney and two defunct companies located in a contiguous state.     \nB.  The Burnett Defendants are also subject to specific personal jurisdiction in this District \n  Although this court has personal jurisdiction over the Burnett Defendants due to the \n                                                 \n \n  4.  See 1:13-cv-324; 1:13-cv-497; 1:13-cv-499; 1:13-cv-498. \n \n  5.  The Plaintiffs recently filed an amended complaint in which they seek to transfer their FLSA claims to \nthis court.  (Doc. No. 83.)  However, the undersigned has not yet ruled on this motion.  \n \n  6.  The Burnett Defendants do not say which forum they would be subject to personal jurisdiction. \n7 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 86   Filed 04/30/14   Page 8 of 14 PageID #:  2090\nnationwide service provisions of the RICO statute, this court also has specific personal jurisdiction \nover the Burnett Defendants.  Absent a statute that permits nationwide service of process, when a \nsuit is based on a federal statute, the court looks to the long-arm statute of the state in which it sits \nto determine whether a defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction.  Omni Capital Intern., Ltd. \nRudolf Wolff & Co., Ltd., 484 U.S. 97, 105 (1987).  The Texas long-arm statute confers \njurisdiction to the limits of the federal constitution.  Companion Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co. v. Palermo, \n723 F.3d 557, 559 (5th Cir. 2013).  Therefore, the undersigned’s focus is whether the exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction offends or satisfies constitutional requirements of due process. \n  In order to satisfy due process, the Burnett Defendants must have “certain minimum \ncontacts with [Texas] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of \nfair play and substantial justice.”  Parker v. Pro W. Contractors, L.L.C., No. 13-30142, 2013 WL \n3534082, at *1 (5th Cir. July 15, 2013) (citing Int’l Shoe Co. v. State of Wash., 326 U.S. 310, 316 \n(1945)).  “The minimum contacts requirement is satisfied by either: (1) contacts that give rise to \ngeneral personal jurisdiction or (2) contacts that give rise to specific personal jurisdiction.”  Id. \n(citing Wilson v. Belin, 20 F.3d 644, 647 (5th Cir. 1994)).  Because the Plaintiffs do not argue \nminimum contacts are satisfied through general personal jurisdiction, the undersigned will focus \nonly on whether the Burnett Defendants have sufficient contacts that give rise to specific personal \njurisdiction. \n  “Specific  jurisdiction  is  proper  where  the  defendant  has  ‘purposefully  directed  his \nactivities at residents of the forum, and the litigation results from alleged injuries that arise out of \nor relate to those activities.’”  Parker, 2013 WL 3534082, at *1 (5th Cir. July 15, 2013) (citing \nBurger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 474 (1985)); see also Electrosource, Inc. v. \nHorizon Battery Techs. Ltd., 176 F.3d 867, 871 (5th Cir. 1999) (litigation must arise out of or \n8 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 86   Filed 04/30/14   Page 9 of 14 PageID #:  2091\nrelate  to  activities  purposefully  directed  at  residents  of  the  forum).    “The  constitutional \nrequirement for specific jurisdiction is that the defendant has ‘minimum contacts’ with the forum \nstate such that imposing a judgment would not ‘offend traditional notions of fair play and \nsubstantial justice.”’  Stroman Realty, Inc. v. Wercinski, 513 F.3d 476, 484 (5th Cir. 2008) \n(quoting Int’l Shoe Co. v. State of Wash., Office of Unemployment Comp. & Placement, 326 U.S. \n310, 316 (1945)).   \n  The complaint raises these allegations against the Burnett Defendants:   \n  Signal authorized the Burnett Defendants to act as their \nagents for the purposes of recruiting and providing Indian welders \nand pipefitters to fill anticipated H-2B guest worker jobs at Signal’s \nOrange, Texas operations.  Signal further authorized the Burnett \nDefendants to represent that Signal would agree to sponsor bona \nfide green card applications for the Plaintiffs and obtain at least two \nH-2B visa extensions which would allow them to remain in the \nUnited States working for Signal while their green card applications \nwere being processed.  Signal knew that the H-2B Workers paid \nexorbitant recruitment  fees to the  Burnett Defendants for these \nservices.  In 2006, the Plaintiffs attended meetings at which the \nBurnett  Defendants,  acting  on  Signal’s  behalf,  informed  the \nPlaintiffs of the opportunity to work for Defendant Signal on H-2B \nvisas which were represented to lead to permanent resident (green \ncard) status.  The Plaintiffs were further informed by the Burnett \nDefendants  that  the  Plaintiffs  would  be  able  to  obtain  legal \npermanent residence for their spouses and children. The Burnett \nDefendants, personally or through their agents, represented to the \nPlaintiffs  that  Signal  would  provide  lawful,  stable,  and  ample \nemployment opportunities; working under an H-2B visa for Signal \nwas  not  inconsistent  with  applying  for  permanent  immigration \nstatus  sponsored  by  Signal;  and,  Signal  would  obtain \nwork-authorized green cards for the Plaintiffs, enabling them to \npermanently  and  legally  reside  in  the  United  States  with  their \nfamilies.  In such communications with the Plaintiffs, the Burnett \nDefendants further promised to act diligently and to do everything \nnecessary to ensure that the Plaintiffs would obtain green cards \nwithin twenty-four months of initiating the green-card process.   \n  In  reasonable  reliance  upon  these  and  other \ncontractually-binding promises made to them regarding green cards \nand work opportunities in the United States, the Plaintiffs signed \ngreen card contracts at various points from mid-2006 to early 2007 \n9 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 86   Filed 04/30/14   Page 10 of 14 PageID #:  2092\nwith  the  Burnett  Defendants  pursuant  to  which  the  Plaintiffs \npromised to pay the fees charged by the Burnett Defendants.  The \ncontracts signed by the Plaintiffs and other documents provided to \nthe Plaintiffs by the Burnett Defendants further promised that the \nPlaintiffs would promptly receive a refund of all or nearly all of \ntheir payments if the Burnett Defendants did not succeed in securing \ngreen cards for the Plaintiffs, as promised.   \n  The  Burnett  Defendants  knew  or  should  have  known, \nhowever,  that  they  would  not  refund  the  Plaintiffs’  money  as \npromised  in  the  contracts  and  other  documents.    The  Burnett \nDefendants induced the Plaintiffs to enter the green card contracts \neven though they did not intend to diligently pursue the Plaintiffs’ \napplications and without any basis for representing that Signal had \nlawful  long-term  employment  opportunities  to  provide  the \nPlaintiffs; that Signal could legally apply for numerous H-2B visa \nextensions to maintain the Plaintiffs’ presence in the United States; \nthat working under an H-2B visa for Signal was not inconsistent \nwith  applying  for  permanent  immigration  status  sponsored  by \nSignal; that green card applications sponsored by Signal would be \nvalid and bona fide under United States immigration law; and that \nsuch applications were likely to be successfully completed and \napproved within the promised timelines.  In reasonable reliance on \nthe Burnett Defendants’ explicit and repeated promises regarding \nthe procurement of green cards and employment opportunities in the \nUnited  States,  the  Plaintiffs  undertook  considerable  economic, \npersonal  and  familial  sacrifices  in  order  to  amass  the  funds \nnecessary  to  initiate  the  green  card  process  with  Signal.    In \nreasonable reliance on the promises of the Burnett Defendants, the \nPlaintiffs signed contracts with these Defendants and made the \npayments  required  by  these  contracts.   Signal  and  the  Burnett \nDefendants  knew  that  the  stated  period  of  need  in  Signal’s \napplications  for  labor  certifications  and  for  H-2B  visas  was \ninconsistent with Signal’s projected actual labor need, and therefore \nthe Burnett Defendants knew their statements made to the United \nStates Government were false.  The Burnett Defendants used the \nH-2B visas, obtained from the United States Government on the \nbasis of false statements by the Burnett Defendants, to elicit certain \npayments from Plaintiffs.  The Plaintiffs then entered the United \nStates on H-2B guest worker visas, issued by the United States \nGovernment on the basis of false statements made by Signal and the \nBurnett Defendants for  the purposes of  working for Defendant \nSignal at its Texas Labor Camp in Orange, Texas.   \n  After  the  Plaintiffs  arrived  at  the  Orange,  Texas  Labor \nCamp, the Burnett Defendants and Defendant Signal reached an \nagreement  regarding  steps  to  be  taken  to  discourage  worker \norganizing efforts and to ensure that the Indian H-2B Workers \n10 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 86   Filed 04/30/14   Page 11 of 14 PageID #:  2093\ncontinued to work at Signal without complaint, as well as to prevent \nthe Indian H-2B Workers from exercising their legal rights.  Since \nfirst contracting with the Burnett Defendants, the Plaintiffs have yet \nto receive the promised green cards or permanent residency from \nany  of  the  Defendants.   Despite  clear  contractual  provisions \nrequiring them to do so, the Burnett Defendants have refused to \nrefund any of the fees the Plaintiffs paid them for unsuccessful \ngreen card and visa processing. \n \nFirst, the Plaintiffs have satisfied the minimum contacts requirement by alleging that the \nBurnett Defendants committed acts outside of Texas—defrauding the Plaintiffs—that caused \ntortious injuries within Texas.  The Fifth Circuit has held that sufficient minimum contacts are \nestablished “[w]hen a nonresident defendant commits a tort within the state, or an act outside the \nstate that causes tortious injury within the state.”  Guidry v. United States Tobacco Co., 188 F.3d \n619, 628 (5th Cir. 1999) (collecting cases).   “Even an act  done outside the state that has \nconsequences or effects within the state will suffice as a basis for jurisdiction in a suit arising from \nthose consequences if the effects are seriously harmful and were intended or highly likely to follow \nfrom the nonresident defendant’s conduct.”  Id. (collecting cases).  An individual injured in \nTexas “need not go to [another jurisdiction] to seek redress from persons who, though remaining in \nother  states,  intentionally,  knowingly  and  recklessly  caused  severe  physical,  emotional  and \neconomic injuries to the plaintiffs and others” in Texas.  Id. at 630.  Based upon the complaint \nalone, the Plaintiffs have established that  the  Burnett  Defendants have sufficient  minimum \ncontacts with Texas because the alleged tortious acts committed by the Burnett Defendants, even if \nmost were committed outside of Texas, caused tortious injuries within Texas.  The Burnett \nDefendants, who allegedly conspired with Signal to lure the Plaintiffs to Orange, Texas with false \npromises, cannot credibly argue that they could not reasonably have anticipated being sued in this \nDistrict. \nSecond, it will not “offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice” for this \n11 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 86   Filed 04/30/14   Page 12 of 14 PageID #:  2094\ncourt to exercise personal jurisdiction over the Burnett Defendants.  The Fifth Circuit has used the \nfollowing test to assess the reasonableness of a court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction: “(1) the \nburden upon the nonresident defendant to litigate in that forum; (2) the forum state’s interests in \nthe matter; (3) the plaintiff’s interest in securing relief; (4) the interstate judicial system’s interest \nin obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies; and (5) the several states’ shared \ninterest in furthering substantive social policies.”  Stroman Realty, Inc. v. Wercinski, 513 F.3d \n476, 487 (5th Cir. 2008) (citing Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court, 480 U.S. 102, 113 \n(1987)).  First, the Burnett Defendants will not face a large burden in litigating the instant case in \nthis District, because the Burnett Defendants, who consist of a single attorney and two defunct \ncompanies, are located in Louisiana, which is contiguous to Texas.  Second, the forum state, \nTexas, does have an interest in the matter because the seventeen Plaintiffs were allegedly injured \nwhile working at Signal’s Orange, Texas facility.  Third, keeping the Burnett Defendants claims \nin this District will provide the most efficient resolution of this case.  Notwithstanding their status \nas putative class members, the Plaintiffs have already moved their case once from a different \nfederal district court after their motion for class certification was denied.  David v. Signal Int’l, \nLLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. Jan. 3, 2012).  The \nmost expeditious option at this point would be to continue this case in this District.  Finally, the \nBurnett Defendants have not pointed out any clashes between the substantive social policies of \nTexas and any other potential forum state in regards to this case.  Taking these factors into \nconsideration, the undersigned finds that this court will not offend traditional notions of fair play \nand substantial justice by exercising personal jurisdiction over the Burnett Defendants.  \nIn summary, the undersigned finds the Plaintiffs have presented sufficient facts to establish \na prima facie case of personal jurisdiciton over the Defendants because the RICO statute provides \n12 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 86   Filed 04/30/14   Page 13 of 14 PageID #:  2095\nfor nationwide service of process.  Furthermore, the undersigned finds the Plaintiffs have also \nestablished a prima facie case that this court has personal jurisdiction over the Burnett Defendants \nby showing 1) the Burnett Defendants have sufficient minimum contacts with Texas; and 2) it will \nnot offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice for this court to exercise personal \njurisdiction over the Burnett Defendants. \nIV.  Recommendation \n  For the reasons stated above, the “Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) \nof  Malvern  C.  Burnett,  the  Law  Offices  of  Malvern  C.

Bowen, 857 F.2d 275, \n276–77 (5th Cir. 1988), and (2) appellate review, except on grounds of plain error, of any such \n13 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00323-MAC-ZJH   Document 86   Filed 04/30/14   Page 14 of 14 PageID #:  2096\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law accepted by the United States District Judge, see Douglass \nv.
