Plaintiffs filed this suit after District Judge Jay Zainey <a href=\"../../../../doc/75969/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">denied class certification</a> on January 3, 2012 in a related case, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14377\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>David v. Signal International</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs were allegedly brought into the United States to provide labor and services to Defendant Signal International at its Orange, Texas site. Signal is based in Pascagoula, Mississippi and is in the business of providing repairs to offshore oil rigs in the Gulf Coast region. The complaint alleges that plaintiffs paid defendant Signal's recruiters as much as $25,000 for travel, visa, and recruitment fees, but upon arrival in the United States found out they would not receive the green cards promised to them. Instead, plaintiffs were forced to pay additional fees to live in racially segregated labor camps ($1050 per month), and were subject to squalid living conditions and threats of both legal and physical harm if they complained about the conditions or decided not to provide labor. Plaintiffs also alleged that the fear and coercion plaintiffs they experienced were exacerbated upon learning of abuses occurring at Signal's Pascagoula, Mississippi site.</p>\r\n<p>The amended complaint, filed on behalf of 47 individuals, asserted claims under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (18 U.S.C. &sect;1589 (forced labor) and 18 U.S.C. &sect;1590 (trafficking)), the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act (18 U.S.C. &sect;1962), the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. &sect;1981), the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. &sect;1985), the Thirteenth Amendment, as well as claims of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract. Plaintiffs were represented by a private law firm.</p>\r\n<p>In February 2014, Magistrate Judge Zack Hawthorn denied Signal's motion to transfer this case to the Eastern District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs in this case only overlapped with the <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14377\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>David</em></a> case insofar as their FLSA claims in the <em>David</em> case were concerned. Additionally, the plaintiffs in this case sued based on events at Signal's Orange, Texas site, whereas plaintiffs in cases pending in the Eastern District of Louisiana sued based on events at Signal's Pascagoula, Mississippi site. Although the Court declined to transfer this case, in May 2014, Magistrate Judge Hawthorn entered a consent order that discovery from the cases in the Eastern District of Louisiana would be allowed to be used here. Additionally, in Dec. 2014, Magistrate Judge Hawthorn severed and transferred Signal's cross-claims against co-defendants (immigration attorneys, recruiters, and labor brokers) to the Eastern District of Louisiana.</p>\r\n<p>In Oct. 2014, Magistrate Judge Hawthorn granted Signal's motion to compel production of plaintiffs' T- and U-visas and applications for such visas. Although a similar motion had already been denied for the cases pending in the Eastern District of Louisiana, the court found that the materials' relevance outweighed any potential in terrorem effect. The Court warned that it would reconsider if Signal sought discovery that was clearly aimed at harassment. Plaintiffs did not comply with this order until Mar. 4, 2015, but the court denied Signal's motion for sanctions, saying its lack of diligence in pursuing the documents rendered it ineligible for relief.</p>\r\n<p>In March 2015, the Court held that Texas laws should apply in the breach of contract and fraud claims, because it did not find that a true conflict existed between Texas and other jurisdictions.</p>\r\n<p>In July 2015, the court stayed the case after Signal filed for bankruptcy. <em>In re Signal Int&rsquo;l, Inc, et al.,</em> No. 15-11498 (Bankr. D. Del. July 12, 2015). As a part of the bankruptcy filings, the plaintiffs entered into a plan support agreement (PSA) which contemplated a settlement of the claims of this lawsuit against Signal entities through a consensual Chapter 11 plan proposed by Signal. The PSA, with a liquidation trust for distribution of settlement proceeds, became effective on Dec. 14, 2015.</p>\r\n<p>In Dec. 2015, in the <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14378\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">related EEOC case</a>, the EEOC announced that the parties had reached a <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/12-18-15.cfm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">settlement</a> for all cases, approved by the bankruptcy court. Signal would pay $5 million to 476 guestworkers through a claims process. All aggrieved individuals included in the litigation could receive relief in spite of the bankruptcy proceedings. Signal's CEO also issued an apology for its conduct.</p>\r\n<p>In this case, <em>Joseph</em>, the parties are updating the court every 120 days as to the status of the bankruptcy proceedings. As of the parties' most recent Feb. 27, 2020 update to the Court, this settlement process remains ongoing.</p>\r\n<p>The stay remains effective in light of Signal's ongoing bankruptcy case.</p>",

' \n  ' \nv.    '    1:13-CV-324 \n  ' \nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL L.L.C.,   ' \net al.  ' \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE \n \n     This case is assigned to the Honorable Ron Clark, United States District Judge, and is referred \nto the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge for all pretrial matters pursuant to a Referral \nOrder.  (Doc. No. 4.)  Pending before the undersigned is Defendant Malvern C. Burnett, the Law \nOffices  of  Malvern  C.  Burnett,  A.P.C.,  and  Gulf  Coast  Immigration  Law  Center,  L.L.C.โs \n(hereinafter referred to interchangeably as โBurnettโ and โthe Burnett Defendantsโ) โMotion and \nMemorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2).โ  (Doc. No. \n31.)1  The undersigned has considered the pending motion and the corresponding response (Doc. \nNo. 44), reply (Doc. No. 50) and sur-reply (Doc. No. 56).  The Burnett Defendantsโ motion \nshould be denied because: 1) the court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendants because the \nRICO statute provides for nationwide service of process; and 2) the court also has specific personal \njurisdiction over the Defendants given the number of alleged tortious acts committed by the \nDefendants both outside and inside Texas that injured the Plaintiffs within Texas.   \n                                                 \n  1.  This motion was previously denied as moot in light of the Plaintiffs filing their second amended \ncomplaint.  (Doc. No. 67.)  The Defendants subsequently filed a โMotion and Memorandum to Reassert Motions to \nDismiss (Doc. No. 32) and Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction (Doc. No. 31).โ  (Doc. No. 69.)  As such, the \nundersigned will analyze and discuss the original motion that was previously denied as moot.    \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 100   Filed 06/18/14   Page 2 of 14 PageID #:  2152\nI.  Background \nA.  Procedural Background \n  On March 7, 2008, twelve individuals who were allegedly trafficked into the United States \nfiled a putative class action against the Defendants in the Eastern District of Louisiana asserting \ntrafficking, RICO, civil rights, and state law contract and fraud claims.2  See David v. Signal Intโl, \nLLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220 (E.D. La.).  That Court denied class certification;3 and, as a result of \nthis ruling, the Plaintiffs in the instant action filed suit in this District, where they were allegedly \nsubjected to deplorable working conditions at a Signal facility in Orange, Texas.  (Doc. No. 64.)  \nOn May 21, 2013, the Plaintiffs filed their original complaint in this court.  (Doc. No. 1.)  \nSubsequently, they filed their first amended complaint on August 1, 2013 (Doc. No. 19) and their \nsecond amended complaint on December 19, 2013.  (Doc. No. 64.)   \nB.  Factual Background    \n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, approximately 590 men, including the Plaintiffs, \nwere allegedly trafficked into the United States through the federal governmentโs H-2B guest \nworker program to provide labor and services to the Signal Defendants.  (Doc. No. 64 , p. 2.)  \nThe Plaintiffs claim they were lured to work for Signal through the fraudulent promise of legal and \npermanent work-based immigration to the United States for themselves and their families.  (Id.)  \nSubsequently, after coming to the United States, the Plaintiffs were allegedly subjected to forced \nlabor and other serious abuses at Signal operations in Orange, Texas.  (Id. at 3.)  The Burnett \nDefendants consist of Malvern C. Burnett and his two corporations: Gulf Coast Immigration Law \n                                                 \n  2.  The Plaintiffs presumably still have FLSA claims pending in the Eastern District of Louisiana.  (Doc. \nNo. 44, p. 5.) \n \n  3.  David v. Signal Intโl, LLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. Jan. \n3, 2012). \n2 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 100   Filed 06/18/14   Page 3 of 14 PageID #:  2153\nCenter, L.L.C. and Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C.  The Plaintiffs accuse Burnett of \nconspiring with Signal and other Defendants to recruit Indian welders and pipefitters to fill \nanticipated H-2B guest worker jobs at Signalโs Orange, Texas operations with false promises of \npermanent residency in the United States for the workers and their families.  (Id., p. 24.)  \nII.  Jurisdiction \n  The Burnett Defendants move to dismiss the instant case under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(2) alleging that this court lacks personal jurisdiction over them.  (Doc. No. 31.)  \nRule 12(b)(2) requires a court to dismiss a claim if it does not have personal jurisdiction over the \ndefendant.  Grynberg v. BP P.L.C., 855 F. Supp. 2d 625, 638 (S.D. Tex. 2012); see FED. R. CIV. P. \n12(b)(2).  โWhen a court rules on a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction without \nholding  an  evidentiary  hearing,  the  party  asserting  jurisdiction  is  required  to  present  facts \nsufficient to constitute a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction to satisfy its burden.โ  Duke \nEnergy Intโl, L.L.C. v. Napoli, 748 F. Supp. 2d 656, 678 (S.D. Tex. 2010) (citing Central Freight \nLines Inc. v. APA Transport Corp., 322 F.3d 376, 380 (5th Cir. 2003); Alpine View Co. v. Atlas \nCopco  A.B.,  205  F.3d  208,  214  (5th Cir.  2000)).    โ[O]n  a  motion  to  dismiss  for  lack  of \njurisdiction, uncontroverted allegations in the plaintiffโs complaint must be taken as true, and \nconflicts between the facts contained in the partiesโ affidavits must be resolved in the plaintiffโs \nfavor for purposes of determining whether a prima facie case for personal jurisdiction exists.โ  \nBullion v. Gillespie, 895 F.2d 213, 217 (5th Cir. 1990). \nA.  Nationwide Service of Process under the RICO Statute, 18 U.S.C. ยง 1965(b) \n  In  their  complaint,  the  Plaintiffs  allege  RICO  claims  against  all  of  the  Defendants, \nincluding the Burnett Defendants.  (Doc. No. 64.)  A federal court obtains personal jurisdiction \nover a defendant in a suit based upon a federal statute if that statute provides for nationwide service \n3 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 100   Filed 06/18/14   Page 4 of 14 PageID #:  2154\nof process and the defendant has had minimum contacts with the United States.  Busch v. \nBuchman, Buchman & OโBrien, Law Firm, 11 F.3d 1255, 1258 (5th Cir. 1994).  The Burnett \nDefendants have minimum contacts with the United States.  (See Doc. No. 31, Ex. 1, Affidavit of \nMalvern Burnett.)  Thus, the next issue to be decided is whether the RICO statute provides \nnationwide service of process.   \n  Title 18 U.S.C. ยง 1965 provides, in pertinent part: \n(a) Any civil action or proceeding under this chapter against any \nperson may be instituted in the district court of the United States for \nany district in which such person resides, is found, has an agent, or \ntransacts his affairs. \n(b) In any action under section 1964 [the civil RICO remedies] of \nthis chapter in any district court of the United States in which it is \nshown that the ends of justice require that other parties residing in \nany other district be brought before the court, the court may cause \nsuch parties to be summoned, and process for that purpose may be \nserved in any judicial district of the United States by the marshal \nthereof. \n \nWhile the Fifth Circuit has not yet ruled on this issue, it appears all of the district courts in \nthis Circuit have interpreted ยง 1965(b) to confer nationwide jurisdiction in a RICO action over \nnonresident  defendants  if  the  plaintiff  can  establish  personal  jurisdiction  over  at  least  one \ndefendant under ยง 1965(a).  Allstate Ins. Co. v. Plambeck, No. 3-08-cv-0388-M, 2009 WL \n347423, at *3 (N.D. Tex. Feb. 11, 2009) (citing RollsโRoyce Corp. v. Heros, Inc., 576 F. Supp. 2d \n765, 778-79 (N.D. Tex. 2008); Oblio Telecom, Inc. v. Patel, No. 3โ08โcvโ0279โL, 2008 WL \n4936488, at *4 (N.D. Tex. Nov. 18, 2008)); see also Hawkins v. Upjohn Co., 890 F. Supp. 601, \n606 (E.D. Tex. 1994); Paolino v. Argyll Equities, L.L.C., 401 F. Supp. 2d 712, 719 (W.D. Tex. \n2005); cf. Flores v. Koster, No. 3:11-cv-0726-M-BH, 2013 WL 4874117, at *4 (N.D. Tex. June \n28, 2013).  Furthermore, the majority of circuit courts have determined that ยง 1965(b) confers \nnationwide service of process in RICO cases.  See Allstate Ins. Co., 2009 WL 347423, at *3 n.2 \n4 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 100   Filed 06/18/14   Page 5 of 14 PageID #:  2155\n(collecting cases).  Accordingly, the undersigned will follow the majority rule that ยง 1965(b) of \nthe RICO statute provides for nationwide service of process if the plaintiff can establish personal \njurisdiction over at least one defendant under ยง 1965(a).  That is easily met here.  In the instant \ncase, it is clear that Defendant Signal transacts its affairs in this forum as they have a facility in \nOrange, Texas.4   \nHaving decided ยง 1965(b) provides nationwide service of process, the last inquiry is \nwhether the โends of justice requireโ Burnett, who resides and conducts business in the Eastern \nDistrict of Louisiana and Southern District of Mississippi, be brought before the court in the \nEastern District of Texas.  See 18 U.S.C. ยง 1965(b) (โIn any action under section 1964 of this \nchapter in any district court of the United States in which it is shown that the ends of justice require \nthat other parties residing in any other district be brought before the court, the court may cause \nsuch parties to be summoned . . . .โ).  โ[T]he โends of justiceโ is a flexible concept uniquely \ntailored to the facts of each case.โ  Cory v. Aztec Steel Building, Inc., 468 F.3d 1226, 1232 (10th \nCir. 2006).  The Fifth Circuit has not implemented any legal test as to what exact set of facts meet \nโthe ends of justiceโ requirement.  See Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Byd:Sign, Inc., No. 6:05-cv-456, \n2006 WL 2822151, at *9 (E.D. Tex. Sept. 28, 2006).  While courts have used somewhat differing \ntests, the two considerations that are used most frequently are 1) whether no other district court \n                                                 \n  4.  The Burnett Defendants argue that even if the RICO statute provides nationwide service of process, the \nPlaintiffs cannot use the nationwide service of process provision because โthe Plaintiffs, opting to utilize the waiver \nprovisions of Rule 4 rather than request service pursuant to the nationwide service provisions of RICO, waived any \nclaim for establishment of personal jurisdiction through the use of RICOโs national service provisions.โ  (Doc. No. \n50, p. 2.)  Burnett did not cite to any authority to support this argument, nor has the undersigned found any cases \nsupporting this assertion.  While it is true that a waiver of service does not waive an objection to personal jurisdiction, \nsee Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(5), it certainly does not eliminate a partyโs ability to obtain personal jurisdiction over a \ndefendant through a nationwide service of process provision.     \n  Burnett also argues that even if ยง 1965(b) provides for nationwide service of process, โthe requirements of the \nconstitution and due process must still be fulfilled.โ  (Doc. No. 31, p. 2.)  This argument is somewhat irrelevant.  \nDue process concerns are subsumed when a federal court exercises personal jurisdiction over a defendant in a suit \nbased upon a federal statute providing for nationwide service of process and the defendant has minimum contacts with \nthe United States.  Busch, 11 F.3d at 1258.   \n \n5 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 100   Filed 06/18/14   Page 6 of 14 PageID #:  2156\nwould have personal jurisdiction over all of the alleged RICO conspirators,5 and 2) judicial \neconomy.6   \nThe โends of justiceโ require the Burnett Defendants to answer in this forum because \nnumerous defendants reside in different states, and there is likely no alternative forum in which \njurisdiction would be proper as to all defendants.7  For reasons of judicial economy, the โends of \njusticeโ should also require the Burnett Defendants to litigate this suit in Texas.  There are \ncurrently forty-eight plaintiffs in this case and over forty in the four companion cases in which the \nBurnett Defendants are parties.8  Most of these same plaintiffs already have pending FLSA claims \nin the Eastern District of Louisiana stemming from the same allegations.  This court has already \ndenied Signalโs vigorous attempts to transfer this case to Louisiana.  (Doc. Nos. 74, 97.)  Thus, it \ncan be assumed that approximately ninety plaintiffs will be trying this case here in Texas against \nthe lead Defendant Signal and the other defendants that have not sought transfer.  If the Burnett \nDefendants were dismissed from this case, most of the plaintiffs in this and the companion cases \nwould be litigating their FLSA claims against Signal in Louisiana, all of the plaintiffs would be \nlitigating their RICO, federal law and state law claims against the remaining defendants here, and \n                                                 \n  5.  Butcherโs Union Local No. 498 v. SDC Investment, Inc., 788 F.2d 535, 539 (9th Cir.1986). \n \n  6.  Farmers Bank of State of Del. v. Bell Mortg. Corp., 577 F. Supp. 34, 35 (D.C. Del. 1978). \n \n  7.  The various Signal Defendants have operations in Texas, Mississippi and Alabama and are organized \nunder the laws of Delaware; Defendant Michael Pol is a Mississippi resident; Defendant Global Resources, Inc. is \norganized under the laws of Mississippi; Defendant Sachin Dewan is a resident of India while Defendant Dewan \nConsultants is organized under the laws of India; Defendant Malvern Burnett is a Louisiana Resident who practices \nlaw in Louisiana and Mississippi; Defendants Law Office of Malvern Burnett, APC and Gulf Coast Immigration \nCenter were corporations organized under the laws of Louisiana; Defendant Indo-Amerisoft, L.L.C. is organized \nunder the laws of Louisiana; Defendant Kurella Rao maintains offices in Louisiana; Defendant J&M Associates of \nMississippi, Inc. and J&M Marine & Industrial, L.L.C. are organized under the laws of Mississippi; and Defendant \nBilly R. Wilks is a resident of Mississippi.  (Doc. No. 64, pp. 14-21.)  The Plaintiffs generally aver that most, if not \nall, of the Defendants have โsubstantial business contacts in Texas.โ   \n \n  8.  See 1:13-cv-323; 1:13-cv-497; 1:13-cv-499; 1:13-cv-498. \n \n6 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 100   Filed 06/18/14   Page 7 of 14 PageID #:  2157\nthen potentially those same RICO, federal law and state law claims against only the Burnett \nDefendants  would  be  litigated  in  an  entirely  different  forum.    That  would  be  contrary  to \nCongressโ intent for the โends of justiceโ provision, which enables plaintiffs to bring all members \nof a nationwide RICO conspiracy before a court in a single trial.  Butcherโs Union, 788 F.2d 535, \n539.  The undersigned also notes that it would be impractical to require roughly ninety plaintiffs \nto travel to a different forum all for the sake of the Burnett Defendants, who consist of a single \nattorney and two โinactiveโ companies located in a contiguous state.    \n The Burnett Defendants argue that given the conclusory allegations against them in the \ncomplaint, the โends of justiceโ do not require they be brought before this court.  They argue the \nPlaintiffs have failed to plead enough facts in their complaint to show the Burnett Defendants \nengaged in a conspiracy or a scheme to defraud or commit illegal acts subjecting them to the \npersonal jurisdiction of this court.  These are not relevant considerations when deciding whether \nโthe ends of justiceโ require the Burnett Defendants to be brought to Texas.  Questions of whether \nthe complaint sufficiently pleads violations of the RICO statute should not be raised in a motion \nunder Rule 12(b)(2) challenging personal jurisdiction.  See Allstate Ins. Co., 2009 WL 347423, at \n*4.  In fact, it is already subject of another motion to dismiss filed by the Burnett Defendants.  \n(Doc. No. 32.) \nB.  The Burnett Defendants are also subject to specific personal jurisdiction in this District \n  Although this court has personal jurisdiction over the Burnett Defendants due to the \nnationwide service provisions of the RICO statute, this court also has specific personal jurisdiction \nover the Burnett Defendants.  Absent a statute that permits nationwide service of process, when a \nsuit is based on a federal statute, the court looks to the long-arm statute of the state in which it sits \nto determine whether a defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction.  Omni Capital Intern., Ltd. \n7 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 100   Filed 06/18/14   Page 8 of 14 PageID #:  2158\nRudolf Wolff & Co., Ltd., 484 U.S. 97, 105 (1987).  The Texas long-arm statute confers \njurisdiction to the limits of the federal constitution.  Companion Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co. v. Palermo, \n723 F.3d 557, 559 (5th Cir. 2013).  Therefore, the undersignedโs focus is whether the exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction offends or satisfies constitutional requirements of due process. \n  In order to satisfy due process, the Burnett Defendants must have โcertain minimum \ncontacts with [Texas] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of \nfair play and substantial justice.โ  Parker v. Pro W. Contractors, L.L.C., No. 13-30142, 2013 WL \n3534082, at *1 (5th Cir. July 15, 2013) (citing Intโl Shoe Co. v. State of Wash., 326 U.S. 310, 316 \n(1945)).  โThe minimum contacts requirement is satisfied by either: (1) contacts that give rise to \ngeneral personal jurisdiction or (2) contacts that give rise to specific personal jurisdiction.โ  Id. \n(citing Wilson v. Belin, 20 F.3d 644, 647 (5th Cir. 1994)).  Because the Plaintiffs do not argue \nminimum contacts are satisfied through general personal jurisdiction, the undersigned will focus \nonly on whether the Burnett Defendants have sufficient contacts that give rise to specific personal \njurisdiction. \n  โSpecific  jurisdiction  is  proper  where  the  defendant  has  โpurposefully  directed  his \nactivities at residents of the forum, and the litigation results from alleged injuries that arise out of \nor relate to those activities.โโ  Parker, 2013 WL 3534082, at *1 (5th Cir. July 15, 2013) (citing \nBurger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 474 (1985)); see also Electrosource, Inc. v. \nHorizon Battery Techs. Ltd., 176 F.3d 867, 871 (5th Cir. 1999) (litigation must arise out of or \nrelate  to  activities  purposefully  directed  at  residents  of  the  forum).    โThe  constitutional \nrequirement for specific jurisdiction is that the defendant has โminimum contactsโ with the forum \nstate such that imposing a judgment would not โoffend traditional notions of fair play and \nsubstantial justice.โโ  Stroman Realty, Inc. v. Wercinski, 513 F.3d 476, 484 (5th Cir. 2008) \n8 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 100   Filed 06/18/14   Page 9 of 14 PageID #:  2159\n(quoting Intโl Shoe Co. v. State of Wash., Office of Unemployment Comp. & Placement, 326 U.S. \n310, 316 (1945)).   \n  The complaint (Doc. No. 64) raises these allegations against the Burnett Defendants:   \n  Signal authorized the Burnett Defendants to act as their \nagents for the purposes of recruiting and providing Indian welders \nand pipefitters to fill anticipated H-2B guest worker jobs at Signalโs \nOrange, Texas operations.  Signal further authorized the Burnett \nDefendants to represent that Signal would agree to sponsor bona \nfide green card applications for the Plaintiffs and obtain at least two \nH-2B visa extensions which would allow them to remain in the \nUnited States working for Signal while their green card applications \nwere being processed. \n  Burnett induced the Plaintiffs to enter into the green card \ncontracts without intending to diligently pursue the Plaintiffsโ green \ncard  applications.    Burnett  falsely  represented  that  (i)  the \ncompanies and/or  entities purportedly sponsoring the Plaintiffsโ \napplications were financially solvent and had reliable and stable \nemployment opportunities to provide the Plaintiffs; (ii) green card \napplications sponsored by such companies would be valid and bona \nfide under U.S. immigration law; and, (iii) such applications were \nlikely  to  be  successfully  completed  and  approved  within  the \npromised  timelines.   Burnett  also  promised  that  the  Plaintiffs \nwould  promptly  receive  a  refund  of  all  or  nearly  all  of  their \npayments  if  they  did  not  succeed  in  securing  green  cards.  \nHowever, since first contracting with the Burnett Defendants, the \nPlaintiffs  have  yet  to  receive  the  green  cards.    Despite  clear \ncontractual provisions requiring them to do so, Burnett has refused \nto refund any of the money the Plaintiffs paid. \n  Instead of getting green cards for the Plaintiffs, the Burnett \nDefendants  assisted  Signal  in  securing  H-2B  visas  that  would \ntemporarily allow the Plaintiffs to live in the United States.  In July \nand August of 2006, the Burnett Defendants, on behalf of Signal, \nfiled with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service the \ncompleted I-129 forms and attachments seeking 590 H-2B visas.  \nKnowing that Signalโs labor need was projected to be at least two to \nthree years, Signal attested to a 10-month labor need running from \nOctober 1, 2006 - July 31, 2007 in these H-2B visa applications.  \nSignal falsely represented to the government that at the end of this \n10 month period, it intended to return all H-2B workers back to \nIndia.  The Burnett Defendants declared that the applications were \nbased on all information of which they had any knowledge despite \nthe fact that they believed Signalโs intentions for these workers \nexceeded ten months. \n9 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 100   Filed 06/18/14   Page 10 of 14 PageID #:  2160\n  In reasonable reliance on the Burnett Defendantsโ explicit \nand repeated promises regarding the procurement of green cards and \nemployment  opportunities  in  the  United  States,  the  Plaintiffs \nundertook considerable economic, personal and familial sacrifices \nin order to amass the funds necessary to initiate the green card \nprocess with Signal.  Signal authorized Burnett to falsely represent \nthat  Signal  would  apply  for  at  least  two  to  three  H-2B  visa \nextensions on behalf of all the Indian H-2B workers to allow them to \nremain in the United States working for Signal while Plaintiffsโ \ngreen card applications were being processed.  In reliance on the \nrepresentations of Burnett and others, the Plaintiffs entered the \nUnited States on H-2B guest worker visas in late 2006 and early \n2007 for the purposes of working for Signal at its Orange, Texas \nfacility.  Upon arrival at Signalโs facilities in Orange, Texas, the \nworkers were shocked to discover the awful conditions they would \nbe forced to live and work in. \n  After the Indian workers started to organize and complain \nabout their terrible working and living conditions, Signal contacted \nthe  Burnett  Defendants  to  express  its  concerns  about  worker \norganizing  efforts.   During  these  conversations  the  Recruiter \nDefendants,  the  Burnett  Defendants,  and  Signal  reached  an \nagreement  regarding  steps  that  they  would  take  to  discourage \nfurther worker organizing efforts to ensure that the majority of the \nIndian  H-2B  workforce  continued  to  work  at  Signal  without \ncomplaint, as well as to prevent the Indian H-2B workforce from \nexercising  their  legal  rights.   Signal  called  a  workforce-wide \nmeeting  on  or  about  March  8,  2007  in  the  Pascagoula  camp, \nattended by Signal management and Burnett.  At this meeting, \nSignal management told the Pascagoula workers that Signal would \nfight back against organizing efforts by the workers.  These threats \nwere  promptly  reported  to  the  workers  in  Orange,  including \nPlaintiffs. \n  Subsequently, Defendants Dewan and Burnett came to the \nSignal camp in Orange, Texas and again falsely promised, in the \npresence  of  Signal  personnel,  that  Signal,  through  its  attorney \nDefendant Burnett, would make bona fide applications for green \ncards and obtain several H-2B visa extensions for the workers who \nhad  not  been  terminated  by  Signal.    The  Plaintiffs  reasonably \nbelieved these false promises. \n \nIn the RICO Fraud Chart attached to the complaint as Exhibit 1, the Plaintiffs further \nallege: \n  Malvern C. Burnett, Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center \nL.L.C., and Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C. filed with \n10 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 100   Filed 06/18/14   Page 11 of 14 PageID #:  2161\nthe Mississippi Department of Employment Security, the Texas \nWorkforce Commission, and the United States Department of Labor \nthe completed forms ETA 750 and attachments seeking permission \nto import and hire 590 foreign guest workers under 8 U.S.C. ยง \n1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b), attendant regulations 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.2(h)(6) \nand 20 C.F.R. ยง 655.3, and associated administrative letters and/or \nguidance (commonly known as โthe H-2B guest worker programโ). \nIn the applications to the state workforce commissions and forms \nETA 750, Malvern C. Burnett and Signal stated that Signal would \nemploy workers from October 1, 2006 to July 31, 2007, despite their \nknowledge  that  the  projected  labor  need  would  be  at  least \ntwo-to-three  years.  Signal  stated  in  letters  of  support  to  these \napplications that its need for H- 2B guest workers was โpeak load \nand a one-time occurrenceโ and that โthe temporary workers will \nwork for the length of the prescribed dates of need, will be paid in \naccordance with the prevailing wage, and will return to their home \ncountry at the end of employment.โ Signal executives and Malvern \nBurnett  signed  these  applications  swearing,  under  penalty  of \nperjury, to the veracity of the information in these applications. \n  On March 15, 2007, Burnett attended a meeting with the \nPlaintiffs  at  Signalโs  Orange,  Texas  facility.    At  this  meeting, \nSignal  representatives  and  Malvern  Burnett  said  that  if  Texas \nworkers conducted activities โlike the workers in Mississippiโ they \nwould  be  deported.  They  also  told  the  Indian  H-2B  Signal \nemployees that they would apply for green cards for all of them. \n \nFirst, the Plaintiffs have clearly satisfied the minimum contact requirement by alleging the \nBurnett Defendants defrauded the Plaintiffs within Texas.  The Plaintiffs accuse Burnett of \nattending a meeting at Signalโs Orange, Texas facility where he falsely promised the Plaintiffs he \nwould make bona fide applications for green cards and obtain several H-2B visa extensions.  \nFurthermore, the Plaintiffs allege Burnett supplied false information to the Texas Workforce \nCommission in the documents he filed to gain permission to import and hire the Plaintiffs to work \nfor Signal. \nSecond, the Plaintiffs have also satisfied the minimum contacts requirement by alleging the \nBurnett Defendants committed acts outside of Texas that caused tortious injuries within Texas.  \nThe Fifth Circuit has held that sufficient minimum contacts are established โ[w]hen a nonresident \n11 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 100   Filed 06/18/14   Page 12 of 14 PageID #:  2162\ndefendant commits a tort within the state, or an act outside the state that causes tortious injury \nwithin the state.โ  Guidry v. United States Tobacco Co., 188 F.3d 619, 628 (5th Cir. 1999) \n(collecting cases).  โEven an act done outside the state that has consequences or effects within the \nstate will suffice as a basis for jurisdiction in a suit arising from those consequences if the effects \nare  seriously  harmful  and  were  intended  or  highly  likely  to  follow  from  the  nonresident \ndefendantโs conduct.โ  Id. (collecting cases).  An individual injured in Texas โneed not go to \n[another  jurisdiction]  to  seek  redress  from  persons  who,  though  remaining  in  other  states, \nintentionally, knowingly and recklessly caused severe physical, emotional and economic injuries \nto the plaintiffs and othersโ in Texas.  Id. at 630.  Based upon the complaint, the Plaintiffs have \nestablished that the Burnett Defendants have sufficient minimum contacts with Texas because the \nalleged tortious acts committed by the Burnett Defendants, even if most were committed outside of \nTexas, caused tortious injuries within Texas.  The Burnett Defendants, who allegedly conspired \nwith Signal to lure the Plaintiffs to Orange, Texas with false promises, cannot credibly argue that \nthey could not reasonably have anticipated being sued in this District. \nFinally, it will not โoffend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justiceโ for this \ncourt to exercise personal jurisdiction over the Burnett Defendants.  The Fifth Circuit has used the \nfollowing test to assess the reasonableness of a courtโs exercise of personal jurisdiction: โ(1) the \nburden upon the nonresident defendant to litigate in that forum; (2) the forum stateโs interests in \nthe matter; (3) the plaintiffโs interest in securing relief; (4) the interstate judicial systemโs interest \nin obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies; and (5) the several statesโ shared \ninterest in furthering substantive social policies.โ  Stroman Realty, Inc. v. Wercinski, 513 F.3d \n476, 487 (5th Cir. 2008) (citing Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court, 480 U.S. 102, 113 \n(1987)).  First, the Burnett Defendants will not face a large burden in litigating the instant case in \n12 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 100   Filed 06/18/14   Page 13 of 14 PageID #:  2163\nthis District, because the Burnett Defendants, who consist of a single attorney and two โinactiveโ \ncompanies, are located in Louisiana, which is contiguous to Texas.  Second, the forum state, \nTexas, does have an interest in the matter because the forty-eight Plaintiffs were allegedly injured \nwhile working at Signalโs Orange, Texas facility.  Third, keeping the Burnett Defendants claims \nin this District will provide the most efficient resolution of this case.  Notwithstanding their status \nas putative class members, the Plaintiffs have already moved their case once from a different \nfederal district court after their motion for class certification was denied.  David v. Signal Intโl, \nLLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. Jan. 3, 2012).  The \nmost expeditious option at this point would be to continue this case in this District.  Finally, the \nBurnett Defendants have not pointed out any clashes between the substantive social policies of \nTexas and any other potential forum state in regards to this case.  Taking these factors into \nconsideration, the undersigned finds that this court will not offend traditional notions of fair play \nand substantial justice by exercising personal jurisdiction over the Burnett Defendants.  \nIn summary, the undersigned finds the Plaintiffs have presented sufficient facts to establish \na prima facie case of personal jurisdiction over the Defendants because the RICO statute provides \nfor nationwide service of process.  Furthermore, the undersigned finds the Plaintiffs have also \nestablished a prima facie case that this court has personal jurisdiction over the Burnett Defendants \nby showing: 1) the Burnett Defendants have sufficient minimum contacts with Texas; and 2) it will \nnot offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice for this court to exercise personal \njurisdiction over the Burnett Defendants. \nIV.

NO. 32) \n \nThis case is assigned to the Honorable Ron Clark, United States District Judge, and is \nreferred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge for all pretrial matters pursuant to a \nReferral Order.   (Doc. No. 4.)   Before the undersigned is a โMotion to Dismiss Pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)โ filed by Malvern C. Burnett, the Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, \nA.P.C., and Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, L.L.C (hereinafter referred to interchangeably \nas โBurnettโ and โthe Burnett Defendantsโ).  (Doc. No. 32.)  The undersigned has considered \nthe pending motion and the corresponding response (Doc. No. 47), reply (Doc. No. 51) and \nsur-reply  (Doc.  No.  57).    The  Burnett  Defendantsโ  motion  should  be  denied  because  the \nPlaintiffs have sufficiently stated a claim upon which relief can be granted, and a motion for \nsummary judgment is the proper vehicle to prove the Plaintiffs state law claims are barred by the \nstatute of limitations. \nI.   Background \nA.  Procedural Background \n  On March 7, 2008, twelve individuals who were allegedly trafficked into the United \nStates filed a putative class action against the Defendants in the Eastern District of Louisiana \n1 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 124   Filed 08/04/14   Page 2 of 15 PageID #:  2365\nasserting trafficking, RICO, civil rights, and state law contract and fraud claims.1  See David v. \nSignal Intโl, LLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220 (E.D. La.).  That Court denied class certification;2 and, \nas a result of this ruling, the Plaintiffs in the instant action filed suit in this District, where they \nwere allegedly subjected to deplorable working conditions at a Signal facility in Orange, Texas.  \n(Doc. No. 64.)  On May 21, 2013, the Plaintiffs filed their original complaint in this court.  \n(Doc. No. 1.)  Subsequently, they filed their first amended complaint on August 1, 2013 (Doc. \nNo. 19) and their second amended complaint on December 19, 2013 (Doc. No. 64).    \nB.  Factual Background     \n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, approximately 590 men, including the Plaintiffs, \nwere allegedly trafficked into the United States through the federal governmentโs H-2B guest \nworker program to provide labor and services to the Signal Defendants.   (Doc. No. 64 , p. 2.)  \nThe Plaintiffs claim they were lured to work for Signal through the fraudulent promise of legal \nand permanent work-based immigration to the United States for themselves and their families.  \n(Id.)  Subsequently, after coming to the United States, the Plaintiffs were allegedly subjected to \nforced labor and other serious abuses at Signal operations in Orange, Texas.  (Id. at 3.)    \nThe Burnett Defendants consist of Malvern C. Burnett and his two corporations: Gulf \nCoast Immigration Law Center, L.L.C. and Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C.  The \nPlaintiffs  accuse  Burnett  of  conspiring  with  Signal  and  other  Defendants  to  recruit  Indian \nwelders and pipefitters to fill anticipated H-2B guest worker jobs at Signalโs Orange, Texas \noperations with false promises of permanent residency in the United States for the workers and \ntheir families.  (Id., p. 24.)  \n                                         \n  1.  The Plaintiffs presumably still have FLSA claims pending in the Eastern District of Louisiana.  (Doc. \nNo. 44, p. 5.) \n \n  2.

Jurisdiction \n  The Plaintiffs seek recovery pursuant to several federal statutes.  For actions brought \nunder these statutory provisions, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon federal \nquestion jurisdiction.   See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331; 29 U.S.C. ยง 216(b).  For the state law causes of \naction, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon supplemental jurisdiction.   See \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(a).   Venue is proper because the events giving rise to the above claims \noccurred within the confines of this District.    See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391. \nIII.   Rule 12(b)(6) Standard \nRule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes dismissal of a complaint \nthat fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).   A Rule \n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss โis viewed with disfavor and is rarely granted.โ   Harrington v. State \nFarm Fire & Cas. Co., 563 F.3d 141, 147 (5th Cir. 2009).  When a court analyzes a Rule \n12(b)(6) motion, it โaccepts โall well-pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light most \nfavorable to the plaintiff.โโ   In re Katrina Beaches Litig., 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007) \n(quoting Martin K. Eby Constr. Co. v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit, 369 F.3d 464, 467 (5th Cir. \n2004)).  A court should grant such a motion only when the complaint fails to contain โenough \nfacts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.โ   Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 \nU.S. 544, 570 (2007).   A claim is plausible on its face โwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content \nthat  allows  the  court  to  draw  the  reasonable  inference  that  the  defendant  is  liable  for  the \nmisconduct alleged.โ   Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  โThreadbare recitals of the \nelements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.โ   Id. \nIV.  Analysis \n  The Plaintiffs allege Burnett violated the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization \n3 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 124   Filed 08/04/14   Page 4 of 15 PageID #:  2367\nAct (โTVPAโ), the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (โRICOโ), and the Ku \nKlux Klan Act of 1871 (โKKAโ).  (Doc. No. 64.)   The Plaintiffs have also asserted state law \nclaims  of  fraud,  negligent  misrepresentation,  and  breach  of  contract  against  Burnett.    (Id.)  \nFirst, Burnett argues the Plaintiffs have failed to provide sufficient facts to state any claim.  \n(Doc. No. 32.)   Second, Burnett asserts the Plaintiffsโ state law claims are barred by the statute \nof limitations.  (Id.) \nA.   Failure to State a Claim under Rule 12(b)(6) \n  1.   Insufficient Facts \n  Burnett generally argues the Plaintiffs failed to state more than mere conclusions and \nrecitals of statutory language without any basis in fact in their complaint.   In particular, Burnett \nargues that the Plaintiffs did not provide any facts showing Burnett engaged in illegal activity.  \nIn addition, Burnett argues that each of the Plaintiffsโ federal claims โhas as its linchpinโ the \nfalse  concept  โthat  threats  of  deportation  satisfy  the  definition  of  involuntary  servitude.โ    \n(Doc. No. 32, p. 2.) \n  First,  the  undersigned  finds,  contrary  to  Burnettโs  assertion,  that  the  Plaintiffs  have \nsufficiently alleged facts that allow the court to draw the reasonable inference that Burnett is \nliable for the alleged misconduct.   In their complaint (Doc. No. 64) the Plaintiffs allege the \nfollowing: \n  The  Plaintiffs  were  trafficked  into  the  United  States \nthrough the federal governmentโs H-2B guest worker program to \nprovide  labor  and  services  to  Signal.    Recruited  to  perform \nwelding,  pipefitting,  and  other  marine  fabrication  work,  the \nPlaintiffs were subjected to forced labor and other serious abuses at \nSignalโs operations in Orange, Texas.    All of the Defendants have \nexploited and defrauded the Plaintiffs by fraudulently recruiting \nthem to work in the United States and effectuating a broad scheme \nof psychological coercion, threats of serious harm and physical \nrestraint, and threatened abuse of the legal process to maintain \n4 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 124   Filed 08/04/14   Page 5 of 15 PageID #:  2368\ncontrol over the Plaintiffs. \n  Upon information and belief, since at least December 2003 \nthrough  at  least  mid-2004,  the  Burnett  Defendants  and  Labor \nBroker  Defendants  frequently  communicated  and  consulted \nfrequently via mail, fax, e-mail and/or telephone communications \nto coordinate and direct Recruiter Defendantsโ activities, including \nadvertising  efforts  on  behalf  of  Labor  Broker  Defendants.  \nRecruiter  Defendants,  the  Burnett  Defendants,  and/or  Labor \nBroker  Defendants  personally  and  through  employees,  agents \nand/or  associates,  told  Plaintiffs  that  if  Plaintiffs  successfully \npassed skills tests administered in the United Arab Emirates or \nIndia  and  paid  fees  totaling  approximately  5  to  8  Indian  lakh \nrupees (approximately $12,000 to $20,000), then Plaintiffs would \nbe able to apply for permanent resident (green card) status in the \nUnited  States  with  Labor  Broker  Defendants.    In  these \nconversations in the first half of 2004, Plaintiffs were informed on \nseveral  occasions  by  Recruiter  Defendants  and/or  the  Burnett \nDefendants that in exchange for an additional fee of approximately \n$1,500 per family member, Plaintiffs would be able to obtain legal \npermanent residence for their spouses and children.  Furthermore, \nthe Burnett Defendants told Plaintiffs that the green card process, \nonce commenced, would be completed within 18 to 24 months.  \nIn  such  communications  with  Plaintiffs,  Recruiter  Defendants, \nBurnett,  and  Labor  Broker  Defendants  further  promised  to  act \ndiligently and do everything necessary to obtain green cards for \nPlaintiffs in the timelines stipulated.    \n  Based on these and other contractually-binding promises \nmade to them regarding green cards and work opportunities in the \nUnited States, Plaintiffs signed contracts at various times in early \nto mid-2004 with the Burnett Defendants.   In these contracts, the \nBurnett  Defendants  further  promised  that  Plaintiffs  would \npromptly receive a refund of all or nearly all of their payments if \nthe  Defendants  did  not  succeed  in  securing  green  cards  for \nPlaintiffs.    The  Burnet  Defendants,  Recruiter  Defendants  and \nLabor Broker Defendants induced the Plaintiffs to enter into the \ngreen  card  contracts:  (a)  without  intent  to  diligently  pursue \nPlaintiffsโ green card applications; and (b) knowingly without any \nbasis whatsoever for representing, inter alia: (i) that the companies \nand/or entities purportedly sponsoring Plaintiffsโ applications were \nfinancially  solvent  and  had  reliable  and  stable  employment \nopportunities to provide Plaintiffs; (ii) that green card applications \nsponsored by such companies would be valid and bona fide under \nU.S. immigration law; (iii) and that such applications were likely \nto be successfully completed and approved within the promised \ntimelines. \n  Upon  information  and  belief,  in  the  course  of  these \n5 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 124   Filed 08/04/14   Page 6 of 15 PageID #:  2369\ncommunications, Signal further authorized Recruiter Defendants \nand the Burnett Defendants to represent that Signal would apply \nfor at least two to three H-2B visa extensions on behalf of all the \nIndian H-2B workers, including Plaintiffs, to allow them to remain \nin the United States working for Signal while Plaintiffsโ green card \napplications were being processed.  Signal authorized its agents to \nmake these representations even though it knew or had reason to \nknow that such visa extensions and green card applications would \nnot be bona fide and valid under United States immigration law.  \nMoreover,  Signal  authorized  its  agents  to  make  these \nmisrepresentations even though it did not have the intention at that \ntime to apply for such visa extensions and/or green cards on behalf \nof all of the Indian H-2B workers, including Plaintiffs. \n  The  Burnett  Defendants  filed  with  the  Mississippi \nDepartment  of  Employment  Security,  the  Texas  Workforce \nCommission,  and  the  United  States  Department  of  Labor  the \ncompleted forms ETA 750 and attachments seeking permission to \nimport  and  hire  590  foreign  guest  workers  under  8  U.S.C.  ยง \n1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b), attendant regulations 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.2(h)(6) \nand 20 C.F.R. ยง 655.3, and associated administrative letters and/or \nguidance  (commonly  known  as  โthe  H-2B  guest  worker \nprogramโ).    In  the  applications  to  the  state  workforce \ncommissions and forms ETA 750, Burnett and Signal stated that \nSignal would employ workers from October 1, 2006 to July 31, \n2007, despite their knowledge that the projected labor need would \nbe at least two-to-three years.  Signal stated in letters of support \nto these applications that its need for H- 2B guest workers was \nโpeak load and a one-time occurrenceโ and that โthe temporary \nworkers will work for the length of the prescribed dates of need, \nwill  be  paid  in  accordance  with  the  prevailing  wage,  and  will \nreturn to their home country at the end of employment.โ  Signal \nexecutives and Burnett signed these applications swearing, under \npenalty  of  perjury,  to  the  veracity  of  the  information  in  these \napplications. \n  After the Indian workers started to organize and complain \nabout their terrible working and living conditions, Signal contacted \nthe  Burnett  Defendants  to  express  its  concerns  about  worker \norganizing  efforts.    During  these  conversations  the  Recruiter \nDefendants,  the  Burnett  Defendants,  and  Signal  reached  an \nagreement  regarding  steps  that  they  would  take  to  discourage \nfurther worker organizing efforts to ensure that the majority of the \nIndian  H-2B  workforce  continued  to  work  at  Signal  without \ncomplaint, as well as to prevent the Indian H-2B workforce from \nexercising  their  legal  rights.    Signal  called  a  workforce-wide \nmeeting  on  or  about  March  8,  2007  in  the  Pascagoula  camp, \nattended by Signal management and Burnett.   At this meeting, \n6 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 124   Filed 08/04/14   Page 7 of 15 PageID #:  2370\nSignal management told the Pascagoula workers that Signal would \nfight  back  against  organizing  efforts  by  the  workers.    These \nthreats were promptly reported to the workers in Orange, including \nPlaintiffs. \n  Subsequently, Defendants Dewan and Burnett came to the \nSignal camp in Orange, Texas and again falsely promised, in the \npresence  of  Signal  personnel,  that  Signal,  through  its  attorney \nDefendant Burnett, would make bona fide applications for green \ncards and obtain several H-2B visa extensions for the workers who \nhad  not  been  terminated  by  Signal.    The  Plaintiffs  reasonably \nbelieved these false promises. \n  Since first contracting with Defendants in India and the \nUnited  Arab  Emirates,  Plaintiffs  have  yet  to  receive  from \nDefendants the green cards Defendants promised them.  Despite \nclear contractual provisions requiring them to do so, the Recruiter \nDefendants,  the  Legal  Facilitator  Defendants,  and  the  Labor \nBroker  Defendants  have  refused  to  refund  any  of  the  moneys \nPlaintiffs  paid  to  them  for  unsuccessful  green  card  and  visa \nprocessing. \n   \n \n  The Plaintiffs have clearly alleged โBurnett was a principal participant in a substantial \nand extremely destructive . . . trafficking scheme planned and executed among the Defendants.โ   \n(Doc. No. 47, p. 2.)   In their motion to dismiss, the Burnett Defendants argue that these facts are \nmerely โoccurrences and actions that are consistent with any attorney representing his or her \nclients.โ  (Doc. No. 32, p. 3.)  However, the Plaintiffs have provided facts describing Burnettโs \nacts that are entirely inconsistent with a โnormalโ attorney-client relationship.    As stated above, \nBurnett allegedly made false promises to the Plaintiffs to lure them into working for Signal.  \nBurnett also required the Plaintiffs to pay him exorbitant fees for his services, and then refused to \nrefund the Plaintiffsโ money when he failed to perform as promised.      \n  Furthermore, the Plaintiffs have provided sufficient facts to support their argument that \nBurnett  is  liable  for  fraud  and  negligent  misrepresentation.   Under  Federal  Rule  of  Civil \nProcedure 9(b), โa party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or \nmistake.  Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a personโs mind may be alleged \n7 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 124   Filed 08/04/14   Page 8 of 15 PageID #:  2371\ngenerally.โ   As detailed above, Burnett made several promises to the Plaintiffs that he allegedly \nknew to  be untrue: 1)  Signal  had  reliable  and stable  employment opportunities to  provide \nPlaintiffs; 2) green card applications sponsored by Signal would be valid and bona fide under \nU.S.  immigration  law;  3)  such  applications  were  likely  to  be  successfully  completed  and \napproved within the promised timelines; and 4) Burnett would refund the Plaintiffsโ money if he \nfailed to perform.   (Doc. No. 64, p. 25.)  In reliance on Burnettโs promises, the Plaintiffs \nโplunged themselves and their families into debt,โ and traveled to the United States to work at \nSignalโs Orange, Texas facility.  (Id., p. 2.)   \n  The Plaintiffs have also provided sufficient facts alleging that Burnett conspired with \nSignal.  More than once, in their complaint and the RICO chart attached to the complaint as \nExhibit 1, the Plaintiffs allege that the Burnett Defendants worked with the Recruiter Defendants \nand Signal to carry out this scheme.  The Plaintiffs identify letters and phone conversations \nshowing the Defendants conspired to: 1) recruit the Plaintiffs with false promises of permanent \nresidency for themselves and their families; and 2) keep the Plaintiffs from protesting their \nmistreatment and leaving Signalโs employ.    \n  Finally, Burnett generally states the Plaintiffs failed to allege facts to support their breach \nof  contract  claim.    (Doc.  No.  32,  p.  5.)    However,  the  Plaintiffs  allege  they  entered  into \ncontracts with Burnett under which they would pay fees to Burnett in exchange for his promise \nto provide them with lawful employment and work-authorized green cards enabling them to \npermanently and legally reside in the United States with their families.   (Doc. No. 64, pp. \n25-26.)  Burnett allegedly breached this contract by not fulfilling those promises and refusing to \nrefund the fees the Plaintiffs paid him.   (Id., p. 50.)  \n8 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 124   Filed 08/04/14   Page 9 of 15 PageID #:  2372\n  2.   Involuntary Servitude \n  The Burnett Defendants also argue that โeach of the federal causes of action has as its \nlinchpin the concept that threats of deportation satisfies the definition of involuntary servitude,โ \nand โas a matter of law, the threat of deportation does not satisfy a determination of involuntary \nservitude.โ  (Doc. No. 32, p. 2.)  The Burnett Defendants do not elaborate on how each of the \nPlaintiffsโ claims is based on the premise that threats of deportation satisfy the definition of \ninvoluntary servitude.    \n  Nonetheless, the case cited by Burnett in support of his assertion is easily distinguished \nfrom the instant case.   In Zavala v. Wal Mart Stores, the plaintiffs were โseeking compensation \nfor unpaid overtime and certification of a collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Act \n(FLSA), civil damages under RICO, and damages for false imprisonment.โ   Zavala v. Wal Mart \nStores Inc., 691 F.3d 527, 530 (3d Cir. 2012).   The plaintiffs supported their RICO and false \nimprisonment claims on the theory that the defendants forced them into working by threatening \nto report their immigration status to the authorities.   Id. at 533.   The Court stated that โabsent \nsome  special  circumstances,  threats  of  deportation  are  insufficient  to  constitute  involuntary \nservitude.โ   Id. at 541.   However, unlike the instant case, in Zavala, Wal-Mart did not contract \ndirectly with the plaintiffs; the plaintiffs did not work exclusively for Wal-Mart and โoften \nswitched jobs, freely moving to different employers in different cities;โ and the plaintiffs were \nnot housed in labor camps.   Id.   In fact, the Zavala court asserted that โ[m]odern day examples \nof involuntary servitude have been limited to labor camps, isolated religious sects, or forced \nconfinement.โ   Id. at 540.   In the instant case, the Plaintiffs allege they were housed in a \nguarded, overcrowded and isolated โlabor camps comprised of trailer-like bunkhouses.โ  (Doc. \nNo. 64, p. 38.)   The โlabor campโ was allegedly surrounded by fences and was located in an \n9 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 124   Filed 08/04/14   Page 10 of 15 PageID #:  2373\nisolated industrial area miles removed from shopping, places of worship, public transportation or \nresidential communities.  (Id.)     \n  Furthermore,  the  Supreme  Court  held  in  United  States  v.  Kozminski  that  โthe \nvulnerabilities of the victim are relevant in determining whether the physical or legal coercion or \nthreats thereof could plausibly have compelled the victim to serveโ involuntarily.   United States \nv. Kozminski, 487 U.S. 931, 952 (1988).   The Court further held that โa trial court could \nproperly find that evidence of . . . extremely poor working conditions is relevant to corroborate \ndisputed evidence regarding the use or threatened use of physical or legal coercion . . . .โ   Id.  \nTherefore, a court must consider all of the relevant circumstances when determining whether the \nPlaintiffs  were  forced  to  serve  involuntarily.    In  their  complaint,  the  Plaintiffs  allege  the \nfollowing: \n  The Texas Labor Camp gates were constantly monitored by \nsecurity  guards  retained  by  Signal.  Signalโs  security  guards \nmonitored the Plaintiffsโ comings and goings by requiring them to \nshow their employee identification badges and recording when the \nPlaintiffs entered and exited the camp.   Signalโs security guards \nalso searched the Plaintiffsโ packages and bags when they entered \nthe  camp.    Except  on  rare  occasions,  the  Plaintiffs  were  not \npermitted to receive visitors in the camp.     \n  Up to twenty-four men were housed in each bunkhouse and \nmade to sleep in two tiered bunk beds. The bunk beds were so \ntightly packed in the bunkhouses that it was difficult for workers to \nmove about in the narrow passageways between bunks or sit up in \nbed.  These housing conditions violated OSHA regulations.  The \nTexas Labor Camp bunkhouses had insufficient toilet and bathing \nfacilities  for  twenty-four  men,  resulting  in  long  lines  for  the \nbathrooms before and after work shifts.  Signalโs personnel and \nsecurity guards conducted surprise searches of the dormitory areas \nof  the  bunkhouses,  including  searches  of  workersโ  personal \nbelongings.  Upon information and belief, Signal did not obtain \nthe required permit(s) to furnish board at the Texas Labor Camp, \nand  the  condition  and  sanitation  of  the  board  provided  further \nviolated  federal,  state,  and/or  local  law.    When  the  Plaintiffs \ncomplained  and  asked  to  live  outside  the  Texas  Labor  Camp, \nSignal initially refused and subsequently told workers that if they \n10 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 124   Filed 08/04/14   Page 11 of 15 PageID #:  2374\ntried  to  live  outside  the  Texas  Labor  Camp  Signal  would  still \ndeduct  the  labor  camp  fees  from  the  Plaintiffsโ  wages.    As  a \nresult, the Plaintiffs reasonably believed they had no choice but to \ncontinue living in Signalโs Texas Labor Camp. \n  Signal  only  housed  Indian  H-2B  Workers  such  as  the \nPlaintiffs  in  its  Labor  Camps,  which  other  employees  and \nmanagement at Signal referred to as the โreservation(s).โ  Upon \ninformation and belief, United States citizens and other workers of \nnon-Indian descent and non-Indian race were neither required nor \nallowed to live in or pay for accommodations in Signalโs Texas \nLabor Camp.   Signal subjected the Plaintiffs to skills testing and \nre-testing,  on-the-job  discipline,  layoffs,  periods  without  work, \nlack of safety precautions, unfavorable job assignments, evaluation \nprocesses,  and  other  adverse  employment  actions  to  which \nnon-Indian and United States citizen workers were not similarly \nsubjected. \n  In  addition,  Signal  camp  personnel  and  supervisors \nfrequently subject Plaintiffs to an objectively hostile and abusive \nenvironment. They often used offensive language in speaking with \nand/or referring to Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers and \nregularly insulted Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers on the \nbasis of their race, national origin, and/or alienage. \n  In the isolated and guarded atmosphere of the Texas Labor \nCamp and saddled with the crushing debts they had incurred to \ncome  to  the  United  States  in  reliance  upon  the  Defendantsโ \nrepresentatives,  the  Plaintiffs  reasonably  believed  Signalโs \nstatements were threatening and believed they had no choice but to \ncontinue working for Signal despite terrible working and living \nconditions.   \n  The  Plaintiffs  and  other  Indian  H-2B  Workers  became \nincreasingly  frightened  and  confused,  particularly  when  word \nspread that Signal had locked the gate that served as the sole exit \nfrom  the  Pascagoula  labor  camp.    Plaintiffsโ  continuing \ndependence  on  Signal  for  their  present  and  future  immigration \nstatus, their continuing high levels of indebtedness, as well as other \nfactors reasonably led Plaintiffs to fear serious harm and/or abuse \nof the legal process if they left Signalโs employ. \n \n  In light of these allegations, the undersigned finds the Plaintiffs have stated a plausible \nclaim of involuntary servitude.  Accordingly, the undersigned recommends that the court deny \nthe Burnet Defendantsโ motion to dismiss on the basis that the Plaintiffs failed to state a plausible \nclaim. \n11 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 124   Filed 08/04/14   Page 12 of 15 PageID #:  2375\n  B.  Statute of Limitations   \n  The Burnett Defendants also assert that the Plaintiffsโ pendent state law claims are time \nbarred by the statute of limitations.  Burnett argues the statute of limitations on the state law \nclaims began to run, at the latest, when the David case was filed on March 7, 2008.   (Doc. No. \n32, p. 6.)   Burnett submits that because the plaintiffs were putative class members in David, \nthey were โnecessarily aware of all the factsโ that would trigger the running of the statute of \nlimitations.  (Id.)    Although  Burnett does not  catalogue the statute of limitations for each \npendent state law claim under Texas law, he claims they would expire, at the latest, in four \nyearsโ2012.  (Id.)  The complaint in the instant case was filed in 2013.  Burnett also argues \nthe federal class action filed in the David court, which was not certified, did not toll the running \nof the statute of limitations on the state law claims.   In response, the Plaintiffs argue the David \nCourt explicitly tolled the statute of limitations on all of the Plaintiffsโ state law claims.  (Doc. \nNo. 47, p. 17.)   In the alternative, they argue Texas law supports the tolling of the statute of \nlimitations as to all purported members of a class upon the filing of the class action.  (Id., p. 13.)    \nThe David complaint was filed on March 7, 2008.   (Doc. No. 32, Exh. 2.)  United \nStates District Judge Jay Zainey, upon the consent of Signal and the Burnett Defendants, entered \nan order tolling the statute of limitations for the absent class membersโ (who are the Plaintiffs in \nthis case) state law claims for 120 days until after the courtโs final ruling on class certification.  \nOrder, Kurian David et al. v. Signal International, L.L.C., et al., No. 2:08-cv-1220 (E.D. La. Jan. \n20, 2011) (Doc. No. 982).   Judge Zainey entered an order denying class certification on January \n4, 2012, making the expiration of the tolling period May 3, 2012.   Order and Reasons, David, \nNo. 2:08-cv-1220 (Doc. No. 1117).   The case was subsequently transferred to United States \nDistrict Judge Susie Morgan.   Order Reassigning Case, David, No. 2:08-cv-1220 (Doc. No. \n12 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 124   Filed 08/04/14   Page 13 of 15 PageID #:  2376\n1157).   Over Signalโs objection, Judge Morgan further tolled the statute of limitations for the \nPlaintiffsโ claims until August 28, 2013.   Order and Reasons, David, No. 2:08-cv-1220 (Doc. \nNo. 1379).  However, pursuant to Burnettโs request, Judge Morgan clarified that prior order by \nstating it only tolled the limitations period for the federal law claims, not any state law claims.  \nOrder and Reasons, David, No. 2:08-cv-1220 (Doc. No. 1417). \nFor a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court is  typically not  to  look  beyond  the complaint.  \nHowever, a court may consider attachments to briefing regarding a motion to dismiss if the \ndocuments are referenced in the complaint, central to the complaint, referenced by the parties, \nand their authenticity is not in dispute.   See Walch v. Adjutant Gen. Depโt, 533 F.3d 289, 293โ\n94 (5th Cir. 2008) (citing In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. \n2007)); Causey v. Sewell Cadillac-Chevrolet, Inc., 394 F.3d 285, 288 (5th Cir. 2004).  Those \nare the only documents the undersigned should consider in deciding the motion to dismiss as it \nconcerns the limitations issueโnot the various court orders entered by the New Orleans district \ncourts tolling state statutes of limitations for the pendent state law claims.3   \nNevertheless, even if the undersigned were to consider and apply Judge Zaineyโs tolling \norder from the date the David complaint was filed until its expiration, the undersigned would still \nneed to go outside the pleadings to intelligently determine the appropriate accrual date for the \nvarious state law claims and what effect the tolling period from Judge Zaineyโs order has on the \n                                         \n  3.  Burnett did not address the tolling orders entered by the David court, and the Plaintiffs only mentioned \nJudge Morganโs initial order tolling the statute of limitations for the state law claims, not the order clarifying that the \nprevious order only applied to the federal law claims.  It should be noted that the briefing on the instant motion \noccurred before Judge Morganโs order tolling the statutes of limitations was entered. \n  \n13 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 124   Filed 08/04/14   Page 14 of 15 PageID #:  2377\ntimeliness of the pendent state law claims filed in the instant complaint.4  Pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 12(d), โif on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) matters outside the pleadings \nare presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary \njudgment under Rule 56, and all parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present \nmaterial that is pertinent to the motion.โ   Accordingly, to the extent the Burnett Defendants \nbelieve the Plaintiffsโ state law claims are still barred by the statute of limitations in light of \nJudge Zaineyโs tolling order, that is a matter best addressed in a motion for summary judgment, \nafter the parties have had an opportunity for full discovery and the court can consider evidence \noutside the pleadings.         \nV.  Recommendation \n  For the reasons stated above, the Burnett Defendantsโ โMotion to Dismiss Pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)โ (Doc. No. 32) should be denied, subject to reconsideration in a motion \nfor summary judgment that the state law claims are barred by the statute of limitations. \nVI.   Objections \n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(c) (Supp. IV 2011), each party to this action has the \nright to file objections to this report and recommendation.  Objections to this report must (1) be \nin writing, (2) specifically identify those findings or recommendations to which the party objects, \nand (3) be served and filed within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this \nreport.   See 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(c); Fed R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2).  A party who objects to this \nreport is entitled to a de novo determination by the United States District Judge of those proposed \nfindings and recommendations to which a specific objection is timely made.   See 28 U.S.C. ยง \n                                         \n  4.  Burnett cites Bell v. Showa Denko K.K., 899 S.W.2d 749 (Tex. App. 1995) in support of their \nargument that Texas courts hold the filing of a proposed federal class action does not toll the limitations period on \npendent state law claims.  See also Newby v. Enron Corp., 542 F.3d 463 (5th Cir. 2008).  In those cases, it does \nnot appear the Defendants consented to the tolling of the statute of limitations, as the Burnett Defendants did here, at \nleast for the period of time reflected in Judge Zaineyโs order.  As such, those cases appear to be inapposite. \n14 of 15 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 124   Filed 08/04/14   Page 15 of 15 PageID #:  2378\n636(b)(1)(c); Fed R. Civ.

Bowen, 857 F.2d 275, \n276โ77 (5th Cir. 1988), and (2) appellate review, except on grounds of plain error, of any such \nfindings  of  fact  and  conclusions  of  law  accepted  by  the  United  States  District  Judge,  see \nDouglass v.

Having considered the \npending motion and the corresponding response (Doc. No. 52), reply (Doc. No. 53), and sur-reply \n(Doc. No. 58), the court denies the motion because there is not a substantial overlap between the \ninstant suit and Kurian David et al. v. Signal, Intโl, L.L.C. et al., the first filed suit.  See Civ. A. \nNo. 08-1220 (E.D. La.). \nI.  Background \nA.  Procedural Background \n  On March 7, 2008, twelve individuals who were allegedly trafficked into the United States \nfiled a putative class action against the Defendants in the Eastern District of Louisiana asserting \ntrafficking, RICO, civil rights, and state law contract and fraud claims.1  That Court denied class \n                                                 \n  1.  The District Court has not ruled on the collective action FLSA claims in the David case, which include \nopt-ins by the Plaintiffs in this case.  (Doc. No. 52, p. 9.) \n \n \nPage 1 of 8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 115   Filed 07/15/14   Page 2 of 8 PageID #:  2314\ncertification;2 and, as a result of this ruling, the Plaintiffs in the instant action filed suit in this \nDistrict, where they were allegedly subjected to deplorable working conditions at a Signal facility \nin Orange, Texas.  (Doc. No. 64.)  On May 21, 2013, the Plaintiffs filed a complaint in this court \nagainst the following Defendants: the Burnett Defendants, Signal International L.L.C., Signal \nInternational, Inc., Signal International Texas, G.P., Signal International Texas, L.P. (collectively \nreferred to as โSignalโ), Indo-Amerisoft L.L.C., Kurella Rao, J&M Associates, Inc. of Mississippi, \nBilly R. Wilks, J&M Marine & Industrial, L.L.C., Global Resources, Inc., Michael Pol, Sachin \nDewan,  and  Dewan  Consultants  PVT.  LTD.  (a/k/a  Medtech  Consultants).    The  Burnett \nDefendants consist of Malvern C. Burnett and his two corporations: Gulf Coast Immigration Law \nCenter, L.L.C. and Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C.  The Plaintiffs allege that some or \nall of the Defendants violated the following federal statutes: 1) The Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act of 2003; 2) Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act; 3) The Civil \nRights act of 1866; and 4) The Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871.  (Id.)  In addition, the Plaintiffs bring \nstate law fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract claims against all of the \nDefendants.  (Id.)  On September 3, 2013, the Burnett Defendants filed the pending motion to \ntransfer venue.  (Doc. No. 39.)   \n                                                 \n  2.  David v. Signal Intโl, LLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. Jan. \n3, 2012). \n \nPage 2 of 8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 115   Filed 07/15/14   Page 3 of 8 PageID #:  2315\nB.  Factual Background    \n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, approximately 590 men, including the Plaintiffs, \nwere allegedly trafficked into the United States through the federal governmentโs H-2B guest \nworker program to provide services to the Signal Defendants.  (Doc. No. 64, p. 2.)  The Plaintiffs \nclaim they were lured to work for Signal through the fraudulent promise of legal and permanent \nwork-based  immigration  to  the  United  States  for  themselves  and  their  families.   (Id.)   \nSubsequently, after coming to the United States, the Plaintiffs were allegedly subjected to forced \nlabor and other serious abuses at Signal operations in Orange, Texas.  (Id.)   \nII.  Jurisdiction  \n  The Plaintiffs seek recovery pursuant to several federal statutes.  For actions brought \nunder these statutory provisions, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon federal \nquestion jurisdiction.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331; 29 U.S.C. ยง 216(b).  For the state law causes of \naction, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon supplemental jurisdiction.  See \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(a).  Venue is proper because the events giving rise to the above claims occurred \nwithin the confines of this District.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391.  \nIII.  First to File Rule  \n  The Burnett Defendants  move to transfer the instant case to the Eastern District of \nLouisiana pursuant to the First-Filed Doctrine.  (Doc. No. 39, p. 1.)  โUnder the first-to-file rule, \nwhen related cases are pending before two federal courts, the court in which the case was last filed \nmay refuse to hear it if the issues raised by the cases substantially overlap.โ  Intโl Fid. Ins. Co. v. \nSweet Little Mexico Corp., 665 F.3d 671, 677 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting Cadle Co. v. Whataburger \n \nPage 3 of 8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 115   Filed 07/15/14   Page 4 of 8 PageID #:  2316\nof Alice, Inc., 174 F.3d 599, 603 (5th Cir. 1999)).  โThe first-to-file rule is a discretionary \ndoctrine.โ Jones v. Xerox Commercial Solutions, LLC, CIV. A. No. H-13-0650, 2013 WL \n3245957, at *2 (S.D. Tex. June 26, 2013) (quoting Cadle Co., 174 F.3d at 603).  The rule is \nutilized โto avoid the waste of duplication, to avoid rulings which may trench upon the authority of \nsister courts, and to avoid piecemeal resolution of issues that call for a uniform result.โ  Save \nPower Ltd. v. Syntek Fin. Corp., 121 F.3d 947, 950 (5th Cir. 1997).  The party wishing to transfer \nthe case has the burden to prove that transfer is warranted.  Jones, 2013 WL 3245957, at *2 (citing \nSanofiโAventis Deutschland GmbH v. Novo Nordisk, Inc., 614 F. Supp. 2d 772, 777 n. 5 (E.D. \nTex. 2009); VCode Holdings, Inc. v. Cognex Corp., No. 2:07โcvโ138, 2007 WL 2238054, at *2 \n(E.D. Tex. Aug. 3, 2007); Buckalew v. Celanese, LTD., No. Gโ05โ315, 2005 WL 2266619, at *1 \n(S.D. Tex. Sept. 16, 2005)).   \n  โIn deciding whether to apply the first-to-file rule, the Court must resolve two questions: \n(1) are the two pending actions so duplicative or do they involve such substantially similar issues \nthat one court should decide the subject matter of both actions, and if so, (2) which of the two \ncourts  should  take  the  case.โ    Datamize,  Inc.  v.  Fid.  Brokerage  Servs.,  LLC,  No. \n2:03-CV-321-DF, 2004 WL 1683171, at *3 (E.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2004) (citing Texas Instruments v. \nMicron Semiconductor, 815 F. Supp. 994, 997 (E.D. Tex. 1993)).  โThe first-to-file rule does not \nrequire that cases be identical, but merely that there is a substantial overlap in issues and parties.โ  \nWhite v. Peco Foods, Inc., 546 F. Supp. 2d 339, 342 (S.D. Miss. 2008).   \n \nPage 4 of 8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 115   Filed 07/15/14   Page 5 of 8 PageID #:  2317\nIV.  Analysis \n  The Burnett Defendants argue there is substantial overlap between the instant case and the \nfirst filed case, David.  (Doc. No. 39, p. 1.)  While there are similarities in the two cases, the court \nfinds that the two cases do not involve such substantially similar parties and issues that one court \nshould decide the subject matter of both actions. \nA.  Parties \n  There is some overlap between the parties in David and the instant case, but it is not \nsubstantial.  While all of the Plaintiffs in the instant suit are also plaintiffs in David, as explained \nbelow, they are only asserting FLSA claims in David, which they do not assert here.3  (Doc. No. \n52, p. 9.)  Conversely, none of the David plaintiffs asserting non-FLSA claims are parties in the \ninstant case.  (Id.)  The David defendants and the Defendants in this suit are not completely \nidentical, but for purposes of this analysis, the court finds that the difference is insignificant.  \nWhile the first-to-file rule does not require identical parties, see Save Power Ltd., 121 F.3d at 950, \nโthe fact that the parties are different cuts against an argument for substantial overlap.โ  Jones, \n2013 WL 3245957, at *4.   \nB.  Claims \n  Although the first-to-file rule also does not require the issues to completely overlap, โthe \ncases should be more than merely related to support a motion to transfer when venue is otherwise \nappropriate.โ  Buckalew v. Celanese, Ltd., CIV. A. No. G-05-315, 2005 WL 2266619, at *2 (S.D. \n                                                 \n3.  Even if the Plaintiffs in this case were at one point putative class members in the David class action \nlitigation, they were never parties since the class was never certified.  See Smith v. Bayer Corp., 131 S. Ct. 2368, \n2379 (2011) (holding that it is erroneous to believe a nonnamed class member is a party to class action litigation before \nthe class is certified, or if certification is ultimately denied). \n \n \nPage 5 of 8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 115   Filed 07/15/14   Page 6 of 8 PageID #:  2318\nTex. Sept. 16, 2005).  The instant suit and David are related to the extent that all of the claims \nasserted in this suit are also asserted by the different David Plaintiffs.  However, there is not \nsubstantial overlap among the claims in both suits.  As the District Court established in its opinion \ndenying the Plaintiffsโ motion for class certification in David, each of the Plaintiffsโ claims require \nindividualized proof as it pertains to that particular Plaintiff.  David v. Signal Intโl, LLC, Civ. A. \nNo. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. Jan. 3, 2012).  Thus, not only are \neach of the individual Plaintiffsโ forced labor, trafficking, RICO and civil rights claims different \nfrom one another in this suit, as explained below, they are entirely different from their pending \nFLSA claims in David.  Therefore, the issues presented by the Plaintiffs here cannot be resolved \nin the David suit.  W. Gulf Mar. Assโn v. ILA Deep Sea Local 24, S. Atl. & Gulf Coast Dist. of \nILA, AFL-CIO, 751 F.2d 721, 729 (5th Cir. 1985) (โ. . . a district court may dismiss an action \nwhere the issues presented can be resolved in an earlier-filed action pending in another district \ncourt.โ).  The Plaintiffsโ claims in the instant case also rely heavily on the alleged abuses and poor \nworking conditions at the Signal facility in Orange, Texas.  Logically, the conditions experienced \nby the Plaintiffs in this case will be different than those experienced by a majority of the David \nPlaintiffs who were housed in Signalโs Pascagoula, Mississippi facility.  (Doc. No. 32, Exh. 2, pp. \n5-7.)4 \n                                                 \n  4.  Burnett asserts in his motion to transfer: โ[a]ttached hereto as Exhibit 1 is the entire Complaint filed in \nDavid.โ  (Doc. No. 39, p. 2.)  However Burnett did not attach the complaint as an exhibit to his motion when it was \nfiled.  Nonetheless, Burnett did attach the David complaint to his motion to dismiss (Doc. No. 32, Exh. 2), which the \ncourt considered.  \n \nPage 6 of 8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 115   Filed 07/15/14   Page 7 of 8 PageID #:  2319\n  1.  Forced Labor and Trafficking \n  The  success  of  each  Plaintiffโs  forced  labor  and  trafficking  claims  is  dependent  on \nindividualized factors.  The question in a forced labor case is โwhether Defendantsโ coercive \nconduct was such that it could overcome the will of the victim so as to make him render his labor \ninvoluntary.โ  David, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247 at 77.  โThis question cannot be answered \nvia  generalized  class-wide  proof  but  rather  must  be  answered  individually  based  upon \nindividualized proof.โ  Id.  Similarly, with trafficking, โindividual issues will play a significant \npartโ because involuntary servitude is an essential element of the claim.  Id. at 80-81.   \n  2.  RICO Claims \n  The success of each Plaintiffโs RICO claim is also based on each individualโs experience \nbecause the Plaintiff will be โrequired to prove that the [Defendants] committed the predicate acts \nupon which they rely for the pattern of racketeering activity.โ  Id. at 92.  As stated above, proof \nof the predicate acts of trafficking and forced labor are โall premised on coercionโ and โcannot be \nmade without resort to individualized proof.โ  Id.  Additionally, in order to prove the fraud-based \npredicate acts, each Plaintiff will โhave to prove first-party reliance on the alleged fraud that was \ndirected at them,โ because โthe question of individual reliance [is] paramount to resolving whether \nPlaintiffsโ injuries were caused by a RICO violation.โ  Id. at 105-06. \n  3.  Violations of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 \n  The Plaintiffs allege that the Burnett Defendants violated the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1971 by \nviolating their right to be free from โforced labor, involuntary servitude, and trafficking in \npersons.โ  (Doc. No. 64, p. 65.)  Forced labor, involuntary servitude, and trafficking all include \n \nPage 7 of 8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 115   Filed 07/15/14   Page 8 of 8 PageID #:  2320\nan element of coercion, which requires an individualized analysis of each Plaintiffโs situation, as \nstated above.  David, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *128.   \n  As one can easily discern, none of the above causes of action involve substantially similar \nissues to the Plaintiffsโ FLSA claims pending in David, which include claims of violating the \nfederally mandated minimum wage laws.  The proof required for the FLSA claims and the \nremedies sought are distinct from the proof and remedies at issue in the instant matter.  Given that \nthere is not a substantial overlap of the claims between the David litigation and this case, and with \nthe exception of the Plaintiffsโ FLSA claims in David, none of the Plaintiffs in the instant suit and \nDavid overlap, the courtโs denial of the Burnett Defendantsโ motion to transfer will not result in \nโpiecemeal resolution of issues that call for a uniform result.โ  Save Power Ltd. v. Syntek Fin. \nCorp., 121 F.3d 947, 950 (5th Cir. 1997).   \nV.  Conclusion \n \n  The court finds that the instant suit does not substantially overlap with the first-filed suit, \nDavid.  Accordingly, the Burnett Defendantsโ โMotion to Transfer Venue and Memorandum in \nSupportโ (Doc. No. 39) is DENIED. \n \nSIGNED this 14th day of July, 2014.\n   \n__________________________________________________\nZaacckk HHaawwtthhoorrnn\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n \nPage 8 of 8 \n \n ",

Accordingly, the undersigned considers the motion unopposed.  See \nLocal Rule CV-7(d) (โIn the event that a party fails to oppose a motion in the manner prescribed \nherein, the court will assume that the party has no objection.โ).  After reviewing Burnettโs motion \nand the applicable authorities, the undersigned finds that Burnettโs motion should be granted in \npart and that Signalโs cross-claims should be severed from the main action and transferred to the \nEastern District of Louisiana.   \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 205   Filed 12/08/14   Page 2 of 6 PageID #:  7413\nI. Background \nOn March 7, 2008, a putative class action was filed in the Eastern District of Louisiana on \nbehalf of over five hundred plaintiffs who were allegedly victims of human trafficking.  (See Doc. \nNo. 1, David v. Signal Intโl, L.L.C., No. 2:08-1220 (E.D. La. March 7, 2008)).  The court in \nDavid denied class certification (as to all claims except the plaintiffsโ FLSA claims), which caused \nthe putative class members to file suit in the district where their injuries allegedly occurred.  The \nPlaintiffs in this case filed suit in the Eastern District of Texas because they claim to have suffered \ntheir injuries at a Signal facility in Orange, Texas.  \nLike in David, the Plaintiffs in this case sued numerous defendants.  (See Doc. No. 1); \n(See also Doc. No. 1, David v. Signal Intโl, L.L.C., No. 2:08-1220 (E.D. La. March 7, 2008)) \n(naming twelve defendants).  For convenience, the Plaintiffs grouped the Defendants into four \ncategories: โSignalโ (collectively, Signal International, L.L.C., Signal International Texas, G.P., \nSignal  International  Texas,  L.P.,  and  Signal  International,  Inc.),    โRecruiter  Defendants,โ \n(collectively, Global Resources, Inc., Michael Pol, Dewan Consultants Pvt., Ltd., and Sachin \nDewan), โLegal Facilitator Defendantsโ (collectively, Malvern C. Burnett, Malvern C. Burnett \nA.P.C.,  and  the  Gulf  Coast  Immigration  Center,  L.L.C),  and  โLabor  Broker  Defendantsโ \n(collectively, Indo-Amerisoft, L.L.C., Kurella Rao, J & M Associates of Mississippi, Inc., and \nBilly  R.  Wilks).   Also  common  to  both  cases  are  cross-claims  Signal  filed  against  these \ndefendants.  (Doc. No. 164, pp. 59โ78); (Doc. No. 60, David v. Signal,  Intโl, L.L.C., No. \n2:08-1220 (E.D. La. May 9, 2008)).1  Signal filed its cross-claims in the David case in 2008, and \nfiled its cross-claims in this case in 2014. \n \n                                                   \n1.  In this case, Signal claims that is has suspended its cross-claims against defendant Michael Pol (Doc. No. \n164, p. 59 n. 1), and in David, Signalโs claims against him have been dismissed.  (Doc. No. 1976, David v. Signal, \nInlโt, L.L.C., No. 2:08-1220 (E.D. La. Dec. 5, 2014)). \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 205   Filed 12/08/14   Page 3 of 6 PageID #:  7414\nII. Analysis \nBurnett moves, pursuant to the โfirst-to-file-rule,โ to have this court โโ[p]rophylacticallyโ \nrefuse[] to hear Signalโs Cross Claims.โ  (Doc. No. 167, p. 8.)  Alternatively, Burnett requests \nthat the undersigned transfer his claims to the Eastern District of Louisiana.  (Id.)  No party filed \nan opposition or response to Burnettโs motion, thus, it is considered unopposed.  See Local Rule \nCV-7(d) (โIn the event that a party fails to oppose a motion in the manner prescribed herein, the \ncourt  will  assume  that  the  party  has  no  objection.โ).    However,  despite  the  fact  that  the \nundersigned considers Burnettโs motion unopposed, the undersigned finds it prudent to consider \nthe merits of Burnettโs motion.       \nโUnder the first-to-file rule, when related cases are pending before two federal courts, the \ncourt in which the case was last filed may refuse to hear it if the issues raised by the cases \nsubstantially overlap.โ  Intโl Fid. Ins. Co. v. Sweet Little Mex. Corp., 665 F.3d 671, 677 (5th Cir. \n2011) (citation omitted).  โIn such a case, the district court in which the later action was filed may \ndismiss, stay, or transfer the suit in order to avoid duplicative litigation and enforce the principle of \ncomity.โ  Carter v. Depโt of Veterans Affairs, 228 F. Appโx 399, 402 (5th Cir. 2007) (per curiam).  \nโIn deciding whether to apply the first-to-file rule, the Court must resolve two questions: (1) are \nthe two pending actions so duplicative or do they involve such substantially similar issues that one \ncourt should decide the subject matter of both actions, and if so, (2) which of the two courts should \ntake the case.โ  Datamize, Inc. v. Fid. Brokerage Servs., LLC, 2:03-CV-321-DF, 2004 WL \n1683171, at *3 (E.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2004) (Folsom, J.) (citing Tex. Instruments v. Micron \nSemiconductor, 815 F. Supp. 994, 997 (E.D. Tex. 1993)).  โOnly the first issue is for the \nsecond-filed court to decide, however, for in this circuit, โ[o]nce the likelihood of a substantial \noverlap between the two suits ha[s] been demonstrated, it [is] no longer up to the [second filed \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 205   Filed 12/08/14   Page 4 of 6 PageID #:  7415\ncourt] to resolve the question of whether both should be allowed to proceed.โโ  Nabors Drilling \nUSA, L.P. v. Markow, Walker, P.A., 451 F. Supp. 2d 843, 845 (S.D. Miss. 2006) (alteration in \noriginal) (quoting Cadle Co. v. Whataburger of Alice, Inc., 174 F.3d 599, 605โ06 (5th Cir. 1999)). \nThe undersigned finds that the first prong of the first-to-file rule is satisfied here.  Signalโs \ncross claims in David are not just similar or related to the ones in this caseโthey are identical.  \nWhite v. Peco Foods, Inc., 546 F. Supp. 2d 339, 342 (S.D. Miss. 2008) (โThe first-to-file rule does \nnot require that cases be identical, but merely that there is a substantial overlap in issues and \nparties.โ).    First, Signal asserts  cross-claims against the exact  same parties in  both  cases.2  \nCompare (Doc. No. 164) with (Doc. No. 60, David v. Signal, Intโl, L.L.C., No. 2:08-1220 (E.D. \nLa. May 9, 2008)); see also Save Power Ltd. v. Syntek Fin. Corp., 121 F.3d 947, 951 (5th Cir. \n1997) (โComplete identity of parties is not required for dismissal or transfer of a case filed \nsubsequently to a substantially related action.โ).  It is also worth noting that Signalโs cross-claims \nare in no way impacted by the difference in the make-up of the plaintiffs in each case.    \nSecond, Signal asserted identical cross-claims in each case.  In addition, beyond just \npleading  the  same  causes  of  action  against  the  same  defendants,  resolution  of  Signalโs \ncross-claims involves the same facts and raises the same issues in both cases.  In contrast, the \nundersigned denied Signalโs and Burnettโs requests to transfer the Plaintiffsโ claims to the Eastern \nDistrict of Louisiana in part because the Plaintiffs in this case worked at a different facility than the \nplaintiffs in David, and therefore, the proof and facts for the claims would differ between the two \ncases.  (Doc. Nos. 74, 115.)  This is not the case for Signalโs cross-claims.  Accordingly, the \nundersigned finds that there is substantial overlap between Signalโs cross-claims in this case and \nthose in David. \n                                                   \n2. Signal also filed a third-party claim against Zito Companies, L.L.C. that was dismissed.  (Doc. No. 391, \nDavid v. Signal, Intโl, L.L.C., No. 2:08-1220 (E.D. La. April 7, 2009)). \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 205   Filed 12/08/14   Page 5 of 6 PageID #:  7416\nTherefore, the proper course of action is to either transfer, stay, or dismiss Signalโs \ncross-claims.    Burnett  requests  that  this  court  stay  Signalโs  cross  claims  because  โsimply \ndeclining to hear those Cross Claims herein would be the easiest procedural vehicle to allow \nSignalโs Cross Claims to proceed in the court in which they were first filed.โ  (Doc. No. 167, p. 8.)  \nThe undersigned, however, perceives no benefit to merely staying these claims.  To do so would \nonly invite additional litigation on issue and/or claim preclusion after these claims are decided in \nDavid.  (Id. at p. 2) (โWhatever disposition may be reached in David on Signalโs Cross Claims \nagainst Burnett and the other Cross Claim  Defendants  will be res judicata herein.โ).    The \nfirst-to-file rule was meant to promote efficiency, not create additional substantive issues.   \nIn the alternative, Burnett requests that the undersigned transfer Signalโs cross-claims to \nthe Eastern District of Louisiana.  Because this is the most efficient manner of resolving these \nclaims, the undersigned finds that this is the appropriate remedy.  However, in order to transfer \njust Signalโs cross-claims, as opposed the entire case (including the Plaintiffsโ claims), Signalโs \ncross-claims must first be severed from the main case.  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 21, a โtrial court has broad discretion to sever issues to be tried before it.โ  Brunet v. \nUnited Gas Pipeline Co., 15 F.3d 500, 505 (5th Cir. 1994) (citing FED. R. CIV. P. 21); see also \nUnited States v. OโNeil, 709 F.2d 361, 366 (5th Cir. 1983) (noting that under Rule 21 a district \ncourt properly severed a partyโs counterclaims).  The undersigned has authority under Rule 21 to \nsever Signalโs cross-claims even though Burnett did not specifically request such relief.  See \nBrunet, 15 F.3d at 505; United States v. Natโl R.R. Passenger Corp., No. CIV.A 86-1094, 2004 \nWL 1335723, at *6 (E.D. Pa. June 15, 2004) (โThus, while neither party has asked this Court to \nsever, Rule 21 permits a court to sever claims sua sponte.โ).   \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 205   Filed 12/08/14   Page 6 of 6 PageID #:  7417\nIII. Conclusion \n  For the reasons discussed above, the undersigned GRANTS IN PART Burnettโs โMotion \nto Defer Signalโs Cross Claim or in the Alternative to Transfer Venue of Signalโs Cross Claim \nPursuant to the First-Filed Rule.โ (Doc.

The court finds that the breach of \ncontract and fraud claims are governed by Texas law and orders additional briefing on negligent \nmisrepresentation and agency.   \nI.  Applicable Law \nA federal court sitting in diversity applies substantive law of the forum state.  Bayle v. \nAllstate Ins. Co., 615 F.3d 350, 355 (5th Cir. 2010).  The Texas Supreme Court has adopted the \nRestatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws as the proper expression of its choice-of-law rules.  \nDeSantis v. Wackenhut Corp., 793 S.W.2d 670, 677 (Tex. 1990).  Under these rules, unless a \ntrue conflict exists between the laws of Texas and the laws of the other jurisdiction, Texas law \n                                                 \n1 The other Defendants have not filed any briefing on this matter and the deadline set by \nthe court for such briefing has past. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 241   Filed 03/06/15   Page 2 of 3 PageID #:  7939\napplies, because it is the forum state.  Flagship Credit Corp .v. Indian Harbor Ins. Co., 481 F. \nAppโx 907, 910 (5th Cir. 2012) (citing Duncan v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 665 S.W.2d 414, 419 \n(Tex.1984); Greenberg Traurig of N.Y., P.C. v. Moody, 161 S.W.3d 56, 70 (Tex.App.โHouston \n[14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.)). \nII.  Analysis \nA.  Breach of Contract and Fraud Claims \nRegarding the breach of contract claims and the fraud claims, the parties both argue that \nTexas law applies because no true conflict exists between the laws of Texas and India.  The court \nagrees with the parties that no true conflict exists between the laws of Texas and the laws of \nIndia on breach of contract and fraud.  Under Texasโs choice-of-law rules, as no true conflict \nexists, Texas law applies to Plaintiffsโ breach of contract and fraud claims.  See Flagship Credit \nCorp., 481 F. Appโx at 910. \nB.  Negligent Misrepresentation \nAs to the negligent misrepresentation claims, the court finds that a true conflict between \nTexas and Indian law exists.  Texas law requires a showing of reliance, a pecuniary loss, and the \nexercise of reasonable care or competence on the part of the speaker, whereas Indian law does \nnot.  A true conflict exists, and the court must now determine the appropriate law to apply.  The \npartiesโ briefs do not appear to be discussing the same alleged misrepresentations.  Plaintiffsโ \nbriefing seems primarily concerned with the alleged misrepresentations made in India by \nDefendant Dewan and Defendant Burnett, allegedly as agents of the Signal Defendants.  The \nSignal Defendantsโ brief discusses only the alleged misrepresentations they, themselves, made in \nTexas.  The Signal Defendants do not appear to take a position on what the appropriate law \nwould be if Plaintiffs established an agency relationship that would confer liability on them as a \nresult of the actions taken by Defendant Dewan and Defendant Burnett in India.  Plaintiffs are \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 241   Filed 03/06/15   Page 3 of 3 PageID #:  7940\nordered to inform the court whether they disagree with the Signal Defendantsโ position on the \nlaw to apply to statements made in Texas.  If Plaintiffs do disagree, they shall set out the factual \nand legal basis for such disagreement.  Likewise, the Signal Defendants are ordered to inform the \ncourt if they disagree that Indian law would apply if Plaintiffs can establish that the Signal \nDefendants are liable for the alleged misrepresentations made in India by Defendant Dewan and \nDefendant Burnett.  If so, they shall set out the factual and legal basis for such disagreement. \nC.  Agency \nPlaintiffs provide a detailed comparison of Texas law regarding agency with sections of \nthe Indian Contract Act of 1872, presumably because they plan to argue that Defendant Signal is \nliable for the actions taken by Defendant Dewan, Defendant Pol, and Defendant Burnett in India.  \nPlaintiffs argue that no true conflict exists.  The Signal Defendants provide no choice-of-law \nanalysis.  They appear to concede that an agency relationship exists, but that it is limited by the \nIndia Emigration Act of 1983.  Plaintiffs are ordered to inform the court if they believe that the \nSignal Defendants implication of the India Emigration Act of 1983 affects their position that no \ntrue conflict exists.   \nIII.  Conclusion \nThe court finds that the partiesโ briefing on the issues of breach of contract and fraud, and \nthe courtโs review, are sufficient for the court to conclude that Texas law should govern those \nclaims at trial.  The parties shall have until March 13, 2015, to submit any additional choice-of-\nlaw briefing.  Any additional briefing is limited to five pages per side.  \n \n3 \n ",

NO. 98) \n \nThis case is assigned to the Honorable Ron Clark, Chief United States District Judge, and \nis referred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge for all pretrial matters pursuant to a \nReferral Order.   (Doc. No. 4.)  Before the undersigned is the โMotion of Amended Plaintiffs to \nDismiss  without  Prejudice  the  Claims  against  Defendant  Michael  Pol.โ    (Doc.  No.  98.)  \nPlaintiffs Suresh Kakkoth, Sebastian George Pananjikal, Biju Potrayil, Pankajakshan Madhavan, \nGijo  John,  Joy  Kallachiyil  Varkey,  Omanakuttan  Govindan  Kakkanthara,  Iju  James,  Ravi \nRowthu,  Vasavan  Babu,  Abraham  Varghese,  Varghese  Kannampuzha  Devassy,  Paulose \nChirackal Airookaran Joseph, and Subburaj Rengasamy (โAmended Plaintiffsโ) seek to dismiss \ntheir claims against Michael Pol without prejudice.   \nOn May 21, 2013, thirty-three Plaintiffs (โOriginal Plaintiffsโ) filed suit against multiple \nDefendants, including Michael Pol (โPolโ).  (Doc. No. 1.)   Pol filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy \nprotection on June 13, 2013.  The Original Plaintiffs amended their complaint on August 1, \n2013  (Doc.  No.  19),  and  again  on  December  19,  2013.    (Doc.  No.  64.)    The  amended \ncomplaints  added  the  โAmended  Plaintiffs,โ  but  asserted  no  new  substantive  claims.

(Doc.  No.  40)  (โTo  the  extent  that  the \nAmended Plaintiffs assert new claims against Pol that could have been brought prior to the \ncommencement of his Chapter 7 proceedings and were not asserted in the original Complaint, \nsuch claims may be voidable in light of the automatic stay.โ) (citing Sikes v. Global Marine, Inc., \n881 F.2d 176, 178โ79 (5th Cir. 1989)). \nThe Plaintiffs conferred with Polโs bankruptcy counsel, and he did not oppose the relief \nsought.  The undersigned, however, denied the Amended Plaintiffsโ motion to dismiss their \nclaims against Pol as moot due to the Plaintiffsโ second amended complaint.  (Doc.

The court finds that the breach of \ncontract and fraud claims are governed by Texas law and orders additional briefing on negligent \nmisrepresentation and agency.   \nI.  Applicable Law \nA federal court sitting in diversity applies substantive law of the forum state.  Bayle v. \nAllstate Ins. Co., 615 F.3d 350, 355 (5th Cir. 2010).  The Texas Supreme Court has adopted the \nRestatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws as the proper expression of its choice-of-law rules.  \nDeSantis v. Wackenhut Corp., 793 S.W.2d 670, 677 (Tex. 1990).  Under these rules, unless a \ntrue conflict exists between the laws of Texas and the laws of the other jurisdiction, Texas law \n                                                 \n1 The other Defendants have not filed any briefing on this matter and the deadline set by \nthe court for such briefing has past. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 241   Filed 03/06/15   Page 2 of 3 PageID #:  7939\napplies, because it is the forum state.  Flagship Credit Corp .v. Indian Harbor Ins. Co., 481 F. \nAppโx 907, 910 (5th Cir. 2012) (citing Duncan v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 665 S.W.2d 414, 419 \n(Tex.1984); Greenberg Traurig of N.Y., P.C. v. Moody, 161 S.W.3d 56, 70 (Tex.App.โHouston \n[14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.)). \nII.  Analysis \nA.  Breach of Contract and Fraud Claims \nRegarding the breach of contract claims and the fraud claims, the parties both argue that \nTexas law applies because no true conflict exists between the laws of Texas and India.  The court \nagrees with the parties that no true conflict exists between the laws of Texas and the laws of \nIndia on breach of contract and fraud.  Under Texasโs choice-of-law rules, as no true conflict \nexists, Texas law applies to Plaintiffsโ breach of contract and fraud claims.  See Flagship Credit \nCorp., 481 F. Appโx at 910. \nB.  Negligent Misrepresentation \nAs to the negligent misrepresentation claims, the court finds that a true conflict between \nTexas and Indian law exists.  Texas law requires a showing of reliance, a pecuniary loss, and the \nexercise of reasonable care or competence on the part of the speaker, whereas Indian law does \nnot.  A true conflict exists, and the court must now determine the appropriate law to apply.  The \npartiesโ briefs do not appear to be discussing the same alleged misrepresentations.  Plaintiffsโ \nbriefing seems primarily concerned with the alleged misrepresentations made in India by \nDefendant Dewan and Defendant Burnett, allegedly as agents of the Signal Defendants.  The \nSignal Defendantsโ brief discusses only the alleged misrepresentations they, themselves, made in \nTexas.  The Signal Defendants do not appear to take a position on what the appropriate law \nwould be if Plaintiffs established an agency relationship that would confer liability on them as a \nresult of the actions taken by Defendant Dewan and Defendant Burnett in India.  Plaintiffs are \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 241   Filed 03/06/15   Page 3 of 3 PageID #:  7940\nordered to inform the court whether they disagree with the Signal Defendantsโ position on the \nlaw to apply to statements made in Texas.  If Plaintiffs do disagree, they shall set out the factual \nand legal basis for such disagreement.  Likewise, the Signal Defendants are ordered to inform the \ncourt if they disagree that Indian law would apply if Plaintiffs can establish that the Signal \nDefendants are liable for the alleged misrepresentations made in India by Defendant Dewan and \nDefendant Burnett.  If so, they shall set out the factual and legal basis for such disagreement. \nC.  Agency \nPlaintiffs provide a detailed comparison of Texas law regarding agency with sections of \nthe Indian Contract Act of 1872, presumably because they plan to argue that Defendant Signal is \nliable for the actions taken by Defendant Dewan, Defendant Pol, and Defendant Burnett in India.  \nPlaintiffs argue that no true conflict exists.  The Signal Defendants provide no choice-of-law \nanalysis.  They appear to concede that an agency relationship exists, but that it is limited by the \nIndia Emigration Act of 1983.  Plaintiffs are ordered to inform the court if they believe that the \nSignal Defendants implication of the India Emigration Act of 1983 affects their position that no \ntrue conflict exists.   \nIII.  Conclusion \nThe court finds that the partiesโ briefing on the issues of breach of contract and fraud, and \nthe courtโs review, are sufficient for the court to conclude that Texas law should govern those \nclaims at trial.  The parties shall have until March 13, 2015, to submit any additional choice-of-\nlaw briefing.  Any additional briefing is limited to five pages per side.  \n \n3 \n ",

NO. 229) \n \n  This case is assigned to the Honorable Ron Clark, Chief United States District Judge, and \nis referred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge for all pretrial matters pursuant to a \nReferral Order.  (Doc. No. 4.)  Pending before the undersigned is the โMotion to Dismissโ (Doc. \nNo. 229) filed by Defendant, Billy Wilks (โWilksโ).  The Plaintiffs oppose.  (Doc. No. 261.) \n  The Plaintiffs allege that Wilks is one of the โLabor Broker Defendants,โ and that this set \nof Defendants played a vital role in the alleged scheme to bring the Plaintiffs to the United States \nunder the false pretense that they would receive permanent residency.  (Doc. No. 208, pp. 22โ27) \n(discussing the recruitment process).  In addition, the Plaintiffs claim that Wilks is personally \nliable for the conduct of J &M Associates of Mississippi, Inc. (โJ & Mโ) because he โhad full \ncontrol and decision making authority over J & M such that J & M and Wilks were alter egos of \none another.โ  (Doc. No. 208, p. 18.)   \n  On February 23, 2015, Wilks filed a โMotion to Dismiss.โ  (Doc. No. 229.)  In this \nmotion, Wilks seeks dismissal of the claims against him because, according to him, based on the \nโundisputed factsโ he โhad absolutely no dealings with Signal, Global, Burnet, or Dewan in the \nprocessing of the Plaintiffs.โ  (Id.)  Wilks also attached another motion to dismiss, which he \nclaims he filed in August of 2014.  In this motion, Wilks makes the same generic assertion of \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 282   Filed 03/17/15   Page 2 of 3 PageID #:  8797\ninnocence.  (Id.) (โThis complaint fails to offer a bona fide claim which relief can be granted.  \nNone of the charges are true.โ).  This August motion, however, is not reflected on the docket.     \n  After reviewing Wilksโs motion, the undersigned recommends that it be denied.  First, it is \nuntimely.  The second amended scheduling order set October 17, 2014 as the deadline for \ndispositive motions.  Wilks received this order on August 4, 2014, leaving him ample time to file \na dispositive motion.  (Doc. No. 125.)   \nSetting the untimeliness of Wilksโs motion aside, his motion should be denied on the \nmerits.  It appears that Wilks is moving for dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6).  Accordingly, the inquiry is whether the Plaintiffs have stated a plausible claim for \nrelief.  Typically, courts are not to consider extrinsic evidence and take all well-pled facts as true.  \nSee Lone Star Fund V (U.S.), L.P. v. Barclays Bank PLC, 594 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir. 2010).  \nAfter reviewing the Plaintiffsโ complaint, the undersigned finds that they have stated a plausible \nclaim against Wilks.  The Plaintiffsโ complaint offers numerous facts showing that J &M was \ninvolved in the recruitment process.  Moreover, there are sufficient facts that Wilks was in control \nof J & M, and therefore, it plausible that Wilks is the alter ego of J & M, and as such, personally \nliable.  Moreover, all Wilks offers to support the fact that he is not liable are blanket assertions he \nโhad no dealingsโ with the other defendants, or that โthe J & M defendants should not be in this \nsuit.โ  (Doc. No. 229.)  These statements, standing alone, are insufficient to absolve Wilks of any \nwrongdoing.1  \n \n                                                 \n1.  Given that Wilks is proceeding pro se, his pleadings are held to less stringent standards and are to be \nconstrued liberally.  Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972); Perez v. United States, 312 F.3d 191, 194โ95 (5th \nCir. 2002).  Therefore, even if Wilksโs motion is construed as a motion for summary judgment, because he has \nattached no evidence to support his claim that he had no involvement in the operative facts of this case, his motion \nfails.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 282   Filed 03/17/15   Page 3 of 3 PageID #:  8798\nRecommendation \n  For the reasons stated above, the undersigned recommends that Billy Wilksโs โMotion to \nDismissโ (Doc. No. 229) be DENIED. \nObjections \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(c) (Supp. IV 2011), each party to this action has the right \nto file objections to this report and recommendation.  Objections to this report must (1) be in \nwriting, (2) specifically identify those findings or recommendations to which the party objects, (3) \nbe served and filed within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this report; and (4) \nbe no more than eight pages in length.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(c); FED R. CIV. P. 72(b)(2); \nLOCAL RULE CV-72(c).  A party who objects to this report is entitled to a de novo determination \nby the United States District Judge of those proposed findings and recommendations to which a \nspecific objection is timely made.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(c); FED R. CIV. P. 72(b)(3).   \n  A partyโs failure to file specific, written objections to the proposed findings of fact and \nconclusions of law contained in this report, within fourteen days of being served with a copy of this \nreport, bars that party from: (1) entitlement to de novo review by the United States District Judge \nof the findings of fact and conclusions of law, see Rodriguez v.

NO. 161) \n \nThis case is assigned to the Honorable Ron Clark, Chief United States District Judge, and \nis referred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge for all pretrial matters pursuant to a \nReferral Order.  (Doc. No. 4.)  Pending before the undersigned is a โMotion for Partial Summary \nJudgmentโ (Doc. No. 161) filed by Defendants Signal International, L.L.C., Signal International, \nInc., Signal International Texas, G.P., and Signal International Texas, L.P. (collectively, โSignalโ).  \nSignal seeks summary judgment on three of the Plaintiffsโ claims, arguing that some claims are \ndefective as a matter of law, and that there is no genuine dispute of material fact as to others.  \nAfter  considering  the  partiesโ  briefing  (Doc.  Nos.  161,  183,  187,  200)  and  the  applicable \nauthorities, the undersigned recommends that Signalโs โMotion for Partial Summary Judgmentโ \n(Doc. No. 161) be denied. \nI. Background1 \nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, approximately 590 men, including the seventeen \nPlaintiffs in this case, were allegedly trafficked into the United States to provide labor for Signalโs \noperations.  (Doc. No.  64, pp. 2โ4.)  The Plaintiffs claim  that the Defendants  made false \n                                                   \n1.  Local Rule CV-56(a) requires that a motion for summary judgment include a โStatement of Undisputed \nFacts.โ  Signalโs โStatement of Undisputed Factsโ contains both hotly contested facts, as well as legal conclusions.  \nTherefore, this section contains only a brief recitation of the background of this case and should not be construed as a \nstatement of facts. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 2 of 32 PageID #:  7622\npromises of โpermanent work-based immigration to the United States,โ and that to take advantage \nof this promising opportunity, the Plaintiffs allegedly โplunged themselves and their families into \ndebt . . . to pay mandatory recruitment, immigration processing, and travel fees . . . .โ  (Id. at p. 2.)  \nAfter arriving at Signalโs facility in Orange, Texas, the Plaintiffs were allegedly subjected to \nserious  abuses,  threatened  with  deportation  if  they  left,  and  forced  to  live  in  substandard \nconditions.  In addition, the Plaintiffs assert that they could not leave their jobs with Signal due to \nthe large debts they incurred in their homeland.  Signal denies any wrongdoing and denies that the \nPlaintiffs were subjected to forced labor, trafficking, or involuntary servitude.   \nA putative class action was filed in the Eastern District of Louisiana on behalf of all the \nworkers who had allegedly been trafficked to the United States to work at Signalโs facilities in \nTexas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.  (See Doc. 1, David v. Signal Intโl, L.L.C., 2:08-cv-1220 \n(March 7, 2008)).  The court in David denied class certification, which caused the individual class \nmembers to file suit where their alleged injuries occurred.  See David v. Signal Intโl, L.L.C., No \n08-1220, 2012 WL 10759668, at *37 (E.D. La. Jan. 4, 2012).  The Plaintiffs in this case worked at \nSignalโs facility in Orange, Texas, which is within this judicial district.  \nThe Plaintiffs are suing Signal, as well as Malvern C. Burnett, Gulf Coast Immigration \nLaw Center, L.L.C., Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C, Indo-Ameri Soft, L.L.C., Kurella \nRao, J&M Associates, Inc. of Mississippi, Billy R. Wilks, J&M Marine & Industrial, L.L.C., \nMichael Pol, Global Resources, Inc., Sachin Dewan, and Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd. (a/k/a \nMedtech Consultants).  The Plaintiffs allege that some or all of the Defendants violated the \nfollowing federal statutes: (1) the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003; (2) \nthe Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act; (3) the Civil Rights Act of 1866; and (4) \nthe Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871.

No. \n64,  pp.  50โ68.)    Signal  moved  for  summary  judgment  on  three  claims:  violations  of  the \nTrafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization  Act  of  2003  (โTVPRAโ),  violations  of  the \nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (โRICOโ), and violations of the Ku Klux \nKlan Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. ยง1985(3)).  (See Doc. No. 161.)  The undersigned will address \nSignalโs motion on a claim by claim basis. \nA.  First Claim: Violations of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 \n \n  Congress passed the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 to \nโcombat trafficking in persons.โ  See Pub. L. No. 106-386, 114 Stat. 1464, 1446 (codified at 22 \nU.S.C. ยง 7101 et seq.).  This act was amended in 2003 to, inter alia, create a civil remedy for \ncertain violations of Chapter 77 of Title 18 of the United States Code.  See Trafficking Victims \nProtection Reauthorization Act of 2003 (โTVPRAโ), Pub. L. No. 108-193, 117 Stat. 2875, 2878 \n(creating a civil remedy for violations of 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1589, 1590, and 1591).  In their first cause \nof action, the Plaintiffs seek damages under the civil remedies provision of the TVPRA (18 U.S.C. \nยง 1595) for โforced laborโ (18 U.S.C. ยง 1589) and โtrafficking with respect to . . . forced laborโ (18 \nU.S.C. ยง 1590).2 \n                                                   \n2.  The Plaintiffsโ second amended complaint also alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1583, 1584, and \n1592(a).  (Doc. No. 64, pp. 52โ53.)  The Plaintiffsโ response, however, is clear that they are abandoning their \nreliance on these statutes.  (See Doc. No. 183, p. 1โ2) (โPlaintiffs have therefore determined to simplify the case by \ndismissing voluntarily their claim under the TVPA to the extent it relies upon sections 1583, 1584, 1592(a) and \n1592(b).โ).  In addition, they requested leave to file a third amended complaint that deletes these claims (Doc. No. \n212), which was granted.  (Oral Order, 1/28/2015.)  The Plaintiffsโ second amended complaint will be considered as \nthe operative complaint for this order, since that was the live pleading at the time of the partiesโ briefing.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 5 of 32 PageID #:  7625\n  Signal claims that it is entitled to summary judgment on the Plaintiffsโ trafficking claim (18 \nU.S.C. ยง 1590) because (1) the TVPRA did not apply extraterritorially at the time of the alleged \ntrafficking and (2) โโthat there is an absence of evidence to supportโ the case of the Plaintiffs with \nregard to the scienter required by ยง 1590 . . . .โ (Doc. No. 161, p. 20) (quoting Celotex Corp., 477 \nU.S. at 325).  As for the Plaintiffsโ claims premised on violations of ยงยง 1592 and 1594, Signal \nargues that summary judgment is warranted because imposing civil liability for violations of these \ntwo statutes would require an impermissible retroactive application of the TVPRA.   \na.  Applying  the  TVPRA  to  the  facts  of  this  case  constitutes  a  domesticโnot \nextraterritorialโapplication of the statute \n \nSignal argues that the TVPRA did not apply extraterritorially at the time of the alleged \ntrafficking, and because the Plaintiffsโ trafficking claim stems from conduct that is โsignificantly \nextraterritorial,โ their claim fails as a matter of law.  (Doc. No. 161, pp. 12โ18.)  The Plaintiffs \ndo  not  dispute  that  the  TVPRA  had  no  extraterritorial  reach  prior  to  2008.   See  William \nWilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-457, \n122 Stat. 5044, 5071โ72 (amending the TVPRA to confer extraterritorial jurisdiction).  Rather, \nthe Plaintiffs insist that they are merely seeking a domestic application of statute, and therefore, \nwhether the TVPRA can be applied extraterritorially is irrelevant.  (Doc. No. 183, pp. 9โ13.)  \nThe undersigned agrees with the Plaintiffs, and finds that applying the TVPRA to the facts at \nhandโwhich involves trafficking workers into the United Statesโrequires only a domestic \napplication of the statute.3   \n                                                                                                                                                                    \n \n3.  Because this case involves a domestic application of the TVPRA, the undersigned expresses no opinion \non whether the TVPRA had any extraterritorial reach prior to 2008.  Compare Adhikari v. Dauod & Partners, 994 F. \nSupp. 2d 831, 835โ36 (S.D. Tex. 2014) (withdrawing a previous opinion and holding that the TVPRA did not apply \nextraterritorially prior to 2008).   \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 6 of 32 PageID #:  7626\nTo determine whether a statute is being applied extraterritorially or domestically, courts \nare to examine the facts of the case in light of the โโfocusโ of Congressional concernโ in enacting \nthe statute.  Morrison v. Natโl Austl. Bank Ltd., 561 U.S. 247, 266โ70 (2010) (โFor it is a rare \ncase of prohibited extraterritorial application that lacks all contact with the territory of the United \nStates.โ).  For example, in Morrison, the Supreme Court considered whether ยง10(b) of the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 was being applied domestically or extraterritorially.  Id.  The \nalleged misrepresentations that formed the basis of the claim were made in the United States and \nwere about an American company, but the securities that were affected were only traded on a \nforeign stock exchange.  Id. at 251โ53.  The Supreme Court found that the focus of ยง10(b) was \non โtransactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges, and domestic transactions in other \nsecurities,โ as opposed to where the misrepresentations occurred.  Id. at 267.  Therefore, because \nthe securities were only traded on a foreign exchange, as opposed to a domestic exchange, \nimposing liability would require an extraterritorial application of the statute. \nAfter reviewing the plain language of the TVPRA, as well as the legislative history, the \nundersigned finds that what is critical under the TVPRA is โwhere the forced labor occurred and to \nwhere to victims were trafficked, and not from where the victims were trafficked . . . .โ  Tanedo v. \nE. Baton Rouge Parish Sch. Bd., No. SA CV 10-01172, 2012 WL 5378742, at * 6 (C.D. Cal. Aug. \n27, 2012) (emphasis added) (reaching this conclusion based on a comparison to the facts of \nMorrison).  For example, the Congressional findings supporting the passage of the Victims of \nTrafficking  and  Violence  Protection  Act  of  2000โwhich  are  codified  at  22  U.S.C. \nยง 7101(b)โrecognize  that  trafficking  victims  are  โtrafficked  within  or  across  international \nborders,โ and that โtraffickers often transport victims from their home communities to unfamiliar \ndestinations, including foreign countries.โ  22 U.S.C. ยง 7101(b)(1), (5); see also Tanedo, 2012 \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 7 of 32 PageID #:  7627\nWL 5378742, at *6 (citing H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 106-939, at 1 (2000)).  Here, it is undisputed that \nthe Plaintiffs were eventually brought to the United States.  Accordingly, imposing liability under \nยง 1590 requires only a domestic application of the statute.  (See Doc. No. 2077, David v. Signal \nIntโl, L.L.C., 2:08-cv-1220 (E.D. La. Jan. 6, 2015) (finding that the plaintiffsโ claims under the \nTVPRA are not extraterritorial)).   \nSignal argues that the undersigned should follow Adhikari v. Dauod & Partners, 994 F. \nSupp. 2d 831 (S.D. Tex. 2014), which dismissed a trafficking claim on the grounds that the \nTVPRA did not apply extraterritorially prior to 2008.  (See Doc. No. 161, pp. 13โ17); see \nAdhikari, 994 F. Supp. 2d at 835โ37.  Signal, however, overlooks a critical distinctionโthe \nworkers in Adhikari were not trafficked to the United Statesโthey were trafficked from Nepal to \nIraq.4  Adhikari, 994 F. Supp. 2d at 835โ37; see also John Roe I v. Bridgestone Corp., 492 F. Supp. \n2d 998, 990, 999โ1002 (S.D. Ind. 2007) (holding that the TVPRA did not apply where the alleged \ninvoluntary servitude occurred solely in Liberia).  Thus, Adhikari is not on point.  \n  Accordingly, the undersigned agrees with the Plaintiffs and finds the that transporting or \nrecruiting of workers into the United States is a domesticโnot extraterritorialโapplication of the \nTVPRA.  The fact that the Plaintiffs are foreign or some of the acts may have occurred abroad \ndoes not change the domestic character of the Plaintiffsโ claims. \nb.  The Plaintiffs have put forth enough evidence to create a genuine dispute of \nmaterial fact as to whether Signal is liable for trafficking \n \n  Signal next argues that summary judgment is warranted because โthe Plaintiffs have no \nevidence to prove [] that Signal always subjectively intended to convert the recruited individuals \n                                                   \n4.  Some of the workers were told that their ultimate destination would be an American military installation \nin Iraq, and the plaintiffs alternatively argued that Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (โMEJAโ) made it a \ndomestic application of the TVPRA.  Adhikari, 994 F. Supp. at 833.  The court found this unpersuasive.  Id. at 837 \n(noting that โthe Court [had] already expressed [an] unwillingness to rest its jurisdiction on the โmurky area of the lawโ \nthat is the MEJAโ). \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 8 of 32 PageID #:  7628\ninto involuntary, slave-like, forced laborers once they arrived in the United States.โ  (Doc. No. \n161, p. 21.)  Signalโs argument has three parts.  First, ยง 1590 requires finding that Signal \nโknowinglyโ trafficked the Plaintiffs โfor the purposeโ of forced labor, which Signal argues \nrequires โproof of the specific intent associated with premeditated crime.โ  (Id.)  Second, there is \nno evidence to show that Signal had such intent.  Third, to the extent that the Plaintiffsโ claim \nstems from โfinancial coercionโ based on the large debts they incurred, this type of harm was not \nrecognized under the TVPRA until 2008.  Therefore, according to Signal, to find liability based \non financial coercion alone would require a retroactive application of the statute. \ni.  Mental state required under ยง1590 \n  It is unclear whether the parties truly dispute what is required to prove liability under \nยง 1590.  Signal argues that โwhat is required is proof that the recruits [were] being recruited for an \nunlawful form of labor, labor acquired through threats, for example, of serious harm.โ  (Id. at 22.)  \nThe Plaintiffs have not argued that a lesser showing is needed or that Signal is per se liable for \ntrafficking merely by recruiting workers.  However, to the extent that there is a dispute, the \nundersigned will address Signalโs argument.  \nSection 1590 states: โwhoever knowingly recruits, harbors, transports, provides, or obtains \nby any means, any person for labor or services in violation of this chapter shall be fined under this \ntitle or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.โ  18 U.S.C. ยง1590; see also 18 U.S.C. ยง 1594 \n(creating a civil remedy for violations of ยง 1590).  By its terms, ยง 1590 requires recruiting or \ntransporting a person with the knowledge that it is for, amongst other things, forced labor.  \nโKnowinglyโ means having the factual knowledge.  See United States v. Ho, 311 F.3d 589, 605 \n(5th Cir. 2002) (โ[T]he term โknowinglyโ does not have any reference to a state of mind or to \nknowledge of the law.  The knowledge requisite to a knowing violation of a statute is factual \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 9 of 32 PageID #:  7629\nknowledge as distinguished from knowledge of the law . . . .โ) (alterations in original) (quoting \nBryan v. United States, 524 U.S. 184, 192 (1998)).  Therefore, the Plaintiffs need to demonstrate \nthat Signal had knowledge that workers were recruited or transported to be used as forced labor (or \nat least create a genuine dispute of material fact to survive summary judgment).  In other words, \nโ[o]btaining the services of another person is not itself illegal; it is illegal only when accompanied \nby one of the three given circumstances [in ยง1589], and the jury must find that the defendant knew \nthat the circumstance existed.โ  See United States v. Calimlim, 538 F.3d 706, 711 (7th Cir. 2008). \nAs noted above, it appears that the parties agree on this proposition.5  (Doc. No. 161, p. \n21โ22); (Doc. No. 183, pp. 20โ21.)  To the extent that Signal believes that some higher mental \nstate is required, Signal has cited no authority for such a proposition. \nii.  The  Plaintiffs  have  put  forth  sufficient  evidence  of  forced  labor  and \ntrafficking to create a genuine dispute of material fact \n \n  Signal claims that โthe freedom the plaintiffs exercised during their time at Signal is \nirreconcilable with the inference that these individuals were trafficked,โ thus, it is entitled to \nsummary judgment.  (Doc. No. 161, p. 25.)  To support its argument, Signal presents  the \nPlaintiffsโ depositions, in which they testified about their ability to freely come and go from \nSignalโs facility.  (Id. at pp. 9โ12.)  An example from Iju Jamesโs deposition is illustrative: \n \n \n                                                   \n5.  Perhaps the undersignedโs confusion stems from Signalโs extensive discussion of Morrissette v. United \nStates, 342 U.S. 246 (1952).  In Morrissette, the defendant was convicted for โknowinglyโ stealing and converting \ngovernment property.  Id. at 248.  The defendant admitted to taking the property, but argued that he believed that it \nhad been abandoned, and as such, did not โknowinglyโ convert the property.  Id.  The trial court, however, refused to \nallow this defense, which effectively read a mental state out of the statute.  Id. (noting that the trial court stated: โHe \ntook it because he thought it was abandoned and he knew he was on government property. . . That is no defense . . . I \nwill not permit you to show this man thought it was abandoned.โ).  The Supreme Court held that this was an error, and \nthat the statute required the defendant to knowโas a matter of factโthat he was taking government property.  Id. at \n270โ74.  Therefore, if the jury believed that he thought the property had been abandoned, he did not โknowinglyโ \nconvert government property.  To the extent that Morrissette instructs that the undersigned cannot simply read out of \nthe TVPRA the โknowinglyโ element (which the Plaintiffs have not urged), it is applicable.  Otherwise, the \nundersigned strains to understand Signalโs point. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 10 of 32 PageID #:  7630\nQ: Were you ever held against your will by Signal? \n \nA: Against my will? \n \nQ: Uh-huh. \n \nA. No. \n \nQ. Were you ever not free to leave? \n \nA. I donโt think so. \n \n(Id., Ex. 12, 191:11โ16.)  The other Plaintiffs testified similarly.  (See id. at pp. 4โ9.)  Signal \nargues that because the Plaintiffs were not kept under lock-and-key and physically had the ability \nto leave its facility, there can be no claim of forced labor.  In turn, because there is no claim of \nforced labor, there can be no claim for trafficking.  See 18 U.S.C. ยง 1590 (prohibiting the \ntrafficking of a person for forced labor).   \nSignalโs argument, however, is inconsistent with the TVPRA.  At the relevant time, 18 \nU.S.C. ยง 1589 prohibited knowingly providing or obtaining the labor or services of a person: \n(1) by threats of serious harm to, or physical restraint against, that person or another \nperson; \n   \n(2) by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause the person to believe \nthat, if the person did not perform such labor or services, that person or another \nperson would suffer serious harm or physical restraint; or \n \n(3) by means of the abuse or threatened abuse of law or the legal process. \nSee Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-386, 114 Stat. \n1478, 1486โ87 (codified at 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589).  By including the term โserious harm,โ the statute \nexpressly sought to not just prohibit forced labor through physical restraint, but also other \noppressive  forms  of  โnonviolent  coercionโ  as  well.    See  22  U.S.C.  ยง 7101(b)(1),  (13).  \nTherefore, Signalโs argument that summary judgment should be granted merely because the \nPlaintiffs could leave its facility does not comport with the definition of forced labor under the \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 11 of 32 PageID #:  7631\nTVPRA.  The Plaintiffs can survive summary judgment by presenting evidence that creates a fact \nissue as to whether they were forced to continue working for Signal through โphysical restraint,โ \nthreats of โserious harm,โ or โabuse of law or the legal process.โ  See 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589.   \nAfter reviewing the Plaintiffsโ evidence, the undersigned finds that there is a fact issue as to \nwhether the Plaintiffs were subjected to forced labor.  For example, Philip Baby testified that \nSignal  made numerous  threats  that if he left Signal,  he would be turned into immigration \nauthorities.  (Doc. No. 183, Ex. 2, 25:5โ26:6.)  โ[M]any courts have determined that threats of \ndeportation constitute a condition of servitude induced through abuse of the legal process.โ  \nKiwanuka v. Bakilana, 844 F. Supp. 2d 107, 115 (D.D.C. 2012) (collecting cases); but see Zavala \nv. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 691 F.3d 527, 540โ41 (3d Cir. 2012) (holding that โ[a]bsent some special \ncircumstances, threats of deportation are insufficient to constitute involuntary servitude,โ and that \nbecause the plaintiffs did not claim that they were compelled to go to work each day, nor forced to \nstay once their work was finished, and had considerable freedom to move to other cities and find \ndifferent jobs, there was no claim of involuntary servitude); (See also Doc. No. 2077, David v. \nSignal Intโl, L.L.C., 2:08-cv-1220 (Jan. 6, 2015) (finding that Signal was not entitled to summary \njudgment in part because โPlaintiffs have introduced evidence from which a jury could infer \nSignal knowingly threatened immigration consequences in order to maintain its forced laborโ)).  \nThe other Plaintiffs tell similar stories about threats of deportation.  (Doc. No. 183, pp. 4โ9.)  \nTherefore, there is a fact issue as to whether the Plaintiffs were able to freely leave Signalโs \nfacility.  Accordingly, given the Plaintiffsโ testimony and the broad definition of forced labor \nunder the TVPRA, there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to the Plaintiffsโ forced labor and \ntrafficking claims.   \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 12 of 32 PageID #:  7632\niii.  Financial  coercion  was  actionable  under  the  TVPRA  before  the  2008 \namendments \n \nSignal next argues that to the extent that the Plaintiffsโ trafficking claim is premised on the \nfact that the large debts that they undertook to pay the recruitment fees forced them to continue \nworking for Signal, this was not actionable under the TVPRA until 2008.  (Doc. No. 161, pp. 27โ\n31.)  โSerious harmโ was not defined in the original statute.  The 2008 amendments added a \ndefinition:  \nThe  term  โserious  harmโ  means  any  harm,  whether  physical  or  nonphysical, \nincluding psychological, financial, or reputational harm, that is sufficiently serious, \nunder all the surrounding circumstances, to compel a reasonable person of the same \nbackground and in the same circumstances to perform or to continue performing \nlabor or services in order to avoid incurring that harm.   \n \nSee William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. \n110-457, 122 Stat. 5044, 5069.  Signal argues that because financial harm was added to the \nTVPRA in 2008, and โCongress does not legislate unnecessarily,โ financial harm could not have \nbeen part of the statute prior to 2008.  (Doc. No. 161, pp. 28โ29.)  Therefore, Signal asserts that \nimposing liability based on financial coercion would be an impermissible retroactive application \nof the 2008 amendments.  The Plaintiffs argue that the statute was broad enough, at the time of the \nalleged trafficking, to encompass their claim of financial coercion.  (Doc. No. 183, pp. 13โ20.)   \n  The undersigned is not persuaded by Signalโs argument.  First, while financial coercion \nmay be a part of the Plaintiffsโ claim, it is not their only basis for imposing liability under the \nTVPRA.  As discussed above, there appears to be other alleged actions taken by Signal that meet \nthe definition of forced labor under the TVPRA.  Second, the plain language of the statute \ndemonstrates that it encompasses more than just threats of physical harm.  Forced labor was \ndefined at the relevant time as โthreats of serious harm . . . or physical restraint.โ  As the court in \nTanedo noted: โThat ยง 1589 distinguishes between serious harm and physical restraint indicates \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 13 of 32 PageID #:  7633\nthat, prior to 2008, Congress intended that serious harm not be limited to physical harm, and \ninstead include at least some non-physical harm, e.g., financial harm.โ  Tanedo, 2012 WL \n5378742 at *4.  The legislative history supports this reading.  โ[T]he House Conference Report \nfrom 2000 [] stated that the [Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000] โrefers to \na broad array of harms, including both physical and nonphysical,โ and would apply โwhere the \ntraffickers use more subtle means designed to cause their victims to believe that serious harm will \nresult to themselves or others if the leaveโ such as threats of familiesโ โbankruptcy in their home \ncountry.โโ  Id. (quoting H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 106-939, at 101 (2000)).  In addition, while not \ndirectly addressing a claim of financial coercion, the Fifth Circuit found that, prior to 2008, \nโserious harm [under ยง1589(a)] can include psychological coercion.โ  United States v. Nnaji, 447 \nF. Appโx 558, 559 (5th Cir. 2011) (per curiam). \n  Lastly, Signal cites no case applying such a narrow interpretation of โserious harmโ under \nthe TVPRA.  As the Plaintiffs correctly note, the one case upon which Signal relies does not apply \nthe TVPRA, but rather is examining slavery as defined by international norms.  See Velez v. \nSanchez, 693 F.3d 308, 319โ23 (2d Cir. 2012).6      \n  Because the goal of the TVPRA was to reach modern day slavery, which may take on \nmany forms, and โserious harmโ should be interpreted broadly, the undersigned finds that the \nPlaintiffsโ claim of financial coercion was cognizable before 2008.  (See also Doc. No. 2077, \nDavid v. Signal Intโl, L.L.C., 2:08-cv-1220 (Jan. 6, 2015) (holding that โserious harm under \npre-amendment Section 1589 includes financial harmโ)).    \n                                                   \n6.  Interestingly, the district court in Velez dismissed a claim for forced labor under the TVPRA.  See Velez \nv. Sanchez, 754 F. Supp. 2d 488, 498โ99 (E.D.N.Y. 2010).  The court converted the plaintiffโs claim from one \nbrought under the Alien Tort Statute to one brought pursuant to ยง 1589, but found that the evidence did not support \nsuch a claim.  Specifically, the court found that the plaintiffโs fear of being yelled at was not actionable and that โby \nher own admission, [she] never feared physical harm . . . .โ  Id. at 498.  Therefore, neither opinion in Velez adopts \nSignalโs narrow interpretation.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 14 of 32 PageID #:  7634\nc.  Retroactive application of 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1592 and 1594 is no longer at issue \nSignal also argues that โSection 1595 did not authorize a private right of action for \nviolations of ยงยง 1592 or 1594 prior to [2008].โ  (Doc. No. 161, p. 18.)  While Signal is correct \nthat the civil remedies provision of the TVPRA did not expressly encompass these statutes until \n2008, the Plaintiffs have abandoned their reliance on these sections (as well as ยงยง 1583 and 1584).  \n(See Doc. No. 183, p. 25 n. 8); (Doc. No. 207) (moving for leave to file a third amended complaint \nwhich abandons certain claims).  Therefore, there is no need to consider whether these sections \napply retroactively. \nB.  Second Claim: Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act 18 U.S.C. ยง 1962(c) \nand 18 U.S.C. ยง1962(d) \n  The Plaintiffsโ second claim for relief consists of violations of 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1962(c) and \n1962(d) of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (โRICOโ).  (Doc. No. 64, pp. \n53โ62.)  Signal claims that it is entitled to summary judgment on the Plaintiffsโ RICO claims \nbecause: (1) the Plaintiffs failed to establish a distinct RICO enterprise; (2) RICO does not apply \nextraterritorially; and (3) there no proof of a conspiracy.  (Doc. No. 161, pp. 31โ39.)    \na.  The Plaintiffs have alleged a distinct RICO person and RICO enterprise \n Signal argues that the Plaintiffsโ RICO claim is โstructurally defectiveโ because the \nPlaintiffs โallege both that Signal is a RICO โpersonโ and that Signal was a โmemberโ of all RICO \nEnterprises alleged in the Second Claim for Relief . . . .โ  (Id. at p. 31โ32.)  Signalโs argument \nmisconstrues the Plaintiffsโ complaint, as well as misapplies the law on the person/enterprise \ndistinction under RICO.  \nโRICO claims under ยง 1962 require: โ(1) a person who engages in (2) a pattern of \nracketeering activity, (3) connected to the acquisition, establishment, conduct, or control of an \nenterprise.โ  Bradley v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 527 F. Supp. 2d 625, 645 (S.D. Tex. 2007) \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 15 of 32 PageID #:  7635\n(quoting In re Burzynski, 989 F.2d 733, 741โ42 (5th Cir. 1993)) (emphasis in original).  โTo \nestablish liability under ยง 1962(c) one must allege and prove the existence of two distinct entities: \n(1) a โpersonโ; and (2) an โenterpriseโ that is not simply the same โpersonโ referred to by a different \nname.โ  Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd. v. King, 533 U.S. 158, 161 (2001).  RICO defines a \nโpersonโ as โany individual or entity capable of holding a legal or beneficial interest in property.โ  \n18 U.S.C. ยง1961(3).  Signal does not dispute that it can be a RICO person.  See St. Paul Mercury \nIns. Co. v. Williamson, 224 F.3d 425, 447 (5th Cir. 2000) (โ[A] corporation obviously qualifies as \na โpersonโ under RICO and may be subject to RICO liability.โ) (quoting Haroco, Inc. v. Am. Natโl \nBank & Trust Co., 747 F.2d 384, 401 (7th Cir. 1984)).   \nโAn enterprise under RICO can include the usual legal entities such as partnerships and \ncorporations, but it also can include โany union or group of individuals associated in fact although \nnot a legal entity . . . .โโ  Bradley, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 651 (quoting Manax v. McNamara, 842 F.2d \n808,  811  (5th  Cir.  1988)).    The  Supreme  Court  has  indicated  that  โenterpriseโ  should  be \ninterpreted broadly.  See Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 943โ45 (2009) (noting that the \nโvery concept of an association in fact is expansiveโ).  Here, the Plaintiffs argue that there are two \nassociation in fact type enterprises, both of which Signal is a member.  (Doc. No. 183, pp. 26โ27.)  \nTo establish such an enterprise, the Plaintiffs must show evidence of โan ongoing organization, \nformal or informal, and evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.โ  \nBoyle, 556 U.S. at 944. \nIn addition, for claims under ยง 1962(c), courts also require that the RICO person and RICO \nenterprise be distinct.  St. Paul Mercury Ins., 224 F.3d at 447  (โ[S]ubsection (c) requires that the \nRICO person be distinct from the RICO enterprise.โ).  This is where Signal argues that the \nPlaintiffsโ claim is defective.  Signal insists that because โthe Complaint alleges both that Signal \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 16 of 32 PageID #:  7636\nis a RICO โpersonโ and that Signal was a โmemberโ of all RICO enterprises,โ the Plaintiffs have \nfailed to allege an enterprise that is separate and distinct from Signal itself.  (Doc. No. 161, p. 31.)   \nSignalโs argument is misplaced.  First, Signal is simply incorrect when it asserts that the \nPlaintiffs are alleging that โSignal enterprised with itself.โ  (Doc. No. 187, p. 5.)  The Plaintiffs \nhave alleged that Signal is a member of an enterprise; they have not alleged that the entire \nenterprise consists only of Signal and its officers, directors, or employees.  Compare Atkinson v. \nAnadarko Bank & Trust Co., 808 F.2d 438, 440 (5th Cir. 1987) (holding that โAnadarko Bank, \nAnadarko Bankshares, and [] three employeesโ were not an association in fact enterprise separate \nand distinct from Andarko Bank because there was no evidence that these entities โwere associated \nin any manner apart from the activities of the bankโ). \nSecond, Signal misconstrues the relevant case law.  The cases cited by Signal do not stand \nfor the proposition that the Plaintiffsโ RICO claim is defective as a matter of law merely because a \ncorporation is named as a person and a part of a RICO enterprise.  Rather, these cases hold that the \ndistinctiveness element was not satisfied based on the facts.  For example, in  Bradley, the \nplaintiffs alleged that the enterprise consisted of a group of companies.  Bradley, 527 F. Supp. 2d \nat 651.  The court found that there was nothing in the plaintiffsโ complaint โto suggest that the \nenterprise existed for any reason other than to commit the alleged predicate acts.โ  Id.  Moreover, \nthe court found that โeven if [the plaintiffs] had adequately pled an enterprise, they have failed to \nplead that any Defendants were โemployed by or associated with [the] enterpriseโ as required \nunder  ยง 1962(c).โ    Id.  at  651โ52.   Signal  has  not  pointed  to  anything  in  the  record  that \ndemonstrates, as a matter of fact, that the alleged enterprises are not distinct from the various \nmembers.  Accordingly, Signal has not met its burden for summary judgment.   \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 17 of 32 PageID #:  7637\nMoreover, Bradley did not hold that a corporation could notโas a matter of lawโbe \nnamed as part of an enterprise.  What Signal appears to be alluding to is a line of cases holding \nthat when a corporation is named as a RICO person, and that same corporation is named as the \nenterprise, the distinctiveness requirement may not be satisfied.  See Atkinson, 808 F.2d at 440; \nsee also Heden v. Hill, 937 F. Supp. 1230, 1242 (S.D. Tex. 1996) (โWhen the alleged Section \n1962(c) violator is a legal entity, such as a corporation, this required separation is not established \nby  merely  showing  that  the  corporation,  through  its  employees,  officers,  and/or  directors, \ncommitted a pattern of predicate acts in the conduct of its own business.โ).  As the Second Circuit \nnoted, alleging a corporation as a member of an enterprise โdoes not foreclose the possibility of a \ncorporate entity being held liable as a defendant under Section 1962(c) where it associates with \nothers to form an enterprise that is sufficiently distinct from itself.โ  See Riverwoods Chappaqua \nCorp. v. Marine Midland Bank, N.A., 30 F. 3d 339, 344 (2d Cir. 1994).  In other words, groups of \ncorporations  can  form  an  association  in  fact  type  enterprise,  but  a  party  cannot  avoid  the \ndistinctiveness requirement by โalleging a RICO enterprise that consists merely of a corporation \ndefendant associated with its own employees or agents carrying on the regular affairs of the \ndefendants.โ  Isystems v. Spark Networks, Ltd., No. 10-10905, 2012 WL 3101672, at *5 (5th Cir. \nMarch 21, 2012) (per curiam) (quoting Khurana v. Innovative Health Care Sys., 130 F.3d 143, \n155) (5th Cir. 1997)); see also Atlas Pile Driving Co. v. DiCon Fin. Co., 886 F.2d 986, 995 (8th \nCir.  1989)  (upholding  allegations  of  an  enterprise  that  consisted  of  multiple  corporations).  \nBecause the Plaintiffs have alleged a larger enterprise than just Signal, the Plaintiffsโ claim is not \nstructurally defective as a matter of law.7  (See also Doc. No. 2115, David v. Signal Intโl, L.L.C., \n                                                   \n7.  Some commentators have argued that based on principles of statutory interpretation, a corporation cannot \nbe part of an association in fact RICO enterprise.  See, e.g., Randy D. Gordon, โOf Gangs and Gaggles: Can a \nCorporation be part of an Association-in-Fact RICO Enterprise? Linguistic, Historical, and Rhetorical Perspectives, \n16 U. PA. J. BUS. L. 973, 998โ1008 (2014).  According to Mr. Gordon, circuit courts have erred by allowing plaintiffs \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 18 of 32 PageID #:  7638\n2:08-cv-1220 (E.D. La. Jan. 9, 2014) (finding that nearly identical RICO enterprises, which \nincluded Signal as a member, did not violate the distinctiveness requirement)). \nAccordingly, because Signal does not cite to anything in the record demonstrating that the \nalleged members did not form an enterprise, and because merely pleading that Signal is a member \nof an enterprise is not fatal to the Plaintiffsโ RICO claims, Signal is not entitled to summary \njudgment.  Of course, at trial, the Plaintiffs will need to prove all of the elements of a RICO \nenterprise.  See, e.g., Boyle, 556 U.S. at 944 (noting that an association in fact enterprise is \nโproved by evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and evidence that the various \nassociates function as a continuing unitโ).   \nb.  Extraterritorial application of RICO \nSignal next argues that RICO does not apply extraterritorially.  (Doc. No. 161, pp. 32โ34.)  \nSpecifically, Signal argues that โthe civil RICO claim should be dismissed pro tanto,8 based on \nthe theoryโs often unlawful, extraterritorial nature with regard to (1) mail and wire fraud; (2) \ntrafficking; and (3) unlawful document related practices under ยง 1592.โ  (Id. at p. 34.)  The \nPlaintiffs have abandoned their claim under ยง 1592. \n                                                                                                                                                                    \nโto allege association-in-fact enterprises that include (and in many cases consist only of) corporations or other legal \nentities.โ  Id. at 1028; see also Caroline N. Mitchell, et al., โReturning RICO to Racketeers: Corporations Cannot \nConstitute an Associated-in-Fact Enterprise Under 18 U.S.C. ยง 1961(4), 13 FORDHAM J. COPR. & FIN. L. 1 (2008) \n(calling for a return to the โplain meaningโ of RICO and arguing that based on questions asked at oral argument during \nMohawk Indus., Inc. v. Williams, 547 U.S. 516 (2006), many of the justices showed a concern about interpreting RICO \nso broadly).  While these commentators raise interesting points, until the Supreme Court revisits Boyle, which \ninstructed courts to interpret โenterpriseโ broadly, or the Fifth Circuit dictates otherwise, the undersigned is obligated \nto follow precedent.  See, e.g, United States v. Thevis, 665 F.2d 616, 625 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982) (affirming a RICO \nconviction when the enterprise consisted of both individuals and corporations).  Moreover, Signal has not raised the \nissues that these commentators were discussing.  Rather, Signalโs argument is based on the faulty premise that the \nPlaintiffs alleged that Signal has been named as the enterprise, as opposed to just a member of a larger enterprise. \n \n8. Pro tanto is defined as: โTo that extent; for so much; as far as it goes.โ  Blackโs Law Dictionary, p. 1259 \n(8th ed. 2004).  The undersigned understands this to mean that to the extent that the Plaintiffs have plead a civil RICO \ncause of action based on the predicate acts of mail and wire fraud, trafficking, and unlawful document production, the \nPlaintiffsโ claim fails.  The Plaintiffs, however, also pled the predicate act of forced labor, and Signal did not move for \nsummary judgment on that claim.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 19 of 32 PageID #:  7639\nSignal argues as follows: RICO does not apply to conduct outside the United States, most \nof the alleged actionable conduct occurred abroad, therefore, the Plaintiffsโ RICO claim fails.  (Id. \nat pp. 32โ33.)  Signalโs analysis is overly simplistic.  While Signal is correct that numerous \ncourts have held that RICO does not apply extraterritorially, that does not end the inquiry.  See, \ne.g., Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd. v. Seamaster Logistics, Inc., 871 F. Supp. 933, 937โ38 (N.D. Cal. \n2012) (โ[C]ourts have uniformly held that RICO is silent as to its extraterritorial application and \nthat, under Morrison, it therefore has none.โ).  The real issue is whether applying RICO to these \nset of facts requires an extraterritorial application.  In other words, if this were a case involving \nonly foreign conduct, RICO would not apply.  But that is not the case here.  The facts of this case \nare partly foreign and partly domestic.  \nThe Ninth Circuit, in United States v. Xu, 706 F.3d 965, 974โ78 (9th Cir. 2013), which \ninvolved a scheme that had both foreign and domestic ties, undertook a comprehensive analysis of \nwhat conduct RICO reaches in light of Morrison.  The defendants in Xu were charged under \nRICO for a โscheme to steal funds from the Bank of China.โ  Id. at 972.  They argued, however, \nthat the entire conspiracy took place overseas, thus, they could not be charged.  Id. at 974โ75.  \nThe conspiracy consisted of two parts: first, โa criminal enterprise that involved . . . embezzlement \nagainst the Bank of China that occurred in China and Hong Kong,โ and second, โimmigration \nfraud to escape to the to the United States with [the] ill-gotten gains.โ  Id. at 975.   \nThe court in Xu started with the presumption that RICO does not apply extraterritorially.  \nId. at 974โ75.  The court then examined whether โunder the circumstances . . . RICO can be \nlawfully applied to any, or all, of Defendantsโ conductโforeign or domestic.โ  Id. at 975.  The \ncourt noted, โMorrison frames the extraterritorial inquiry in terms of the focus of congressional \nconcern in enacting the statute,โ and while โRICOโs focus is far from clear-cut,โ two general \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 20 of 32 PageID #:  7640\napproaches have evolved.  Id.  โOne camp asserts that RICOโs focus is on the enterprise,โ while \nโthe other camp asserts that RICOโs focus is on the pattern of racketeering activity.โ  Id.  In \naddition, after the Ninth Circuit issued Xu, the Second Circuit articulated yet another test, finding \nthat RICO applies extraterritorially to the extent that the underlying predicate offense applies \nextraterritorially.  European Cmty. v. RJR Nabisco, Inc., 764 F.3d 129, 136 (2d Cir. 2014) \n(โRICO applies extraterritorially if, and only if, liability could attach to extraterritorial conduct \nunder the relevant RICO predicate act.โ).  The Fifth Circuit has yet to address which test to apply \nand courts are split.  See CGC Holding Co., L.L.C. v. Broad & Cassel, No. 13-1255, 2014 WL \n6872148, at *15โ17 (10th Cir. Dec. 8, 2014) (noting that โ[c]ourts have gone in two directions in \nidentifying the โfocusโ of RICOโ).  However, the undersigned need not guess at which test \napplies, since under any approach, Signalโs conduct is domestic in nature. \n  If the focus is on the pattern of racketeering, it is evident that there are sufficient ties to the \nUnited States to apply RICO to the instant case.  As discussed above, the conspiracy in Xu had \ntwo distinct parts.  Xu, 706 F.3d at 978.  The first part, which consisted of stealing money from \nthe Bank of China, had no domestic ties.  Id.  The second part, however, which consisted of \nentering the United States using fraudulent visas and passports in violation of United States \nimmigration  laws,  โbound  the  Defendantsโ  enterprise  to  the  territorial  United  States.โ    Id.  \nTherefore, the court found that because the goal of the enterprise involved a violation of United \nStates immigration law, โthe dual parts of Defendantsโ enterprise were necessarily conjoined in \npursuit of that goalโi.e., to steal large amounts of money from the Bank of China and get away \nwith it in the United States.โ  Id. at 978โ79.  The court held that the defendants could be liable \nunder RICO. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 21 of 32 PageID #:  7641\n  Here, while the actual recruitment of the Plaintiffs may have occurred abroad, it is \nundisputed that the goal was to bring them to the United States.  This nexus to the United States \nties โthe Defendantsโ enterprise to the territorial United Statesโ and allows for RICO to attach.  \nFor example, had the Defendants recruited the Plaintiffs for work in Mexico, then it would be a \nstronger case the there was no domestic tie to trigger RICO under the pattern of racketeering test.  \nHowever, because the workers were recruited for work in the United States, and actually brought \nhere, this conduct is actionable under RICO. \n  Likewise, under the enterprise test, the undersigned finds that this is a domestic enterprise.  \nCourts applying this test consider โwhere the enterpriseโs decisions are made, as opposed to \ncarried out, and thus centers on the โbrainsโ of an enterprise, not the โbrawn.โโ  Xu, 706 F.3d at \n976 (citing European Cmty. v. RJR Nabisco, Inc., No. 02-cv-5771, 2011 WL 843957, at *5โ6 \n(E.D.N.Y.

European Cmty., \n2011 WL 843957, at *6.  The enterprises alleged in this case consist mainly of domestic entities.  \nCompare In re Le-Natureโs, Inc., No. 0-1445, 2011 WL 2112533, at *3 (W.D. Pa. May 26, 2011) \n(โ[T]he very title of the statute, โRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations,โ suggests an \nemphasis on the organization, or enterprise itself.  Consistent with this principle, it has been found \nthat RICO is inapplicable to a solely foreign enterprise.โ) (citations omitted); Sorota v. Sosa, 842 \nF. Supp. 2d 1345, 1350 (S.D. Fla. 2012) (noting that the enterprise, which consisted of only \nPeruvian  individuals  and  companies,  was  a  foreign  enterprise).    Here,  the  majority  of  the \nDefendants are domestic entities, and only Defendants Sachin Dewan and Dewan Consultants are \n                                                   \n9.  The Second Circuit rejected this test in favor of defining RICOโs extraterritorial conduct in terms of the \nunderlying predicate acts.  European Cmty., 764 F.3d at 139 (โWe think it far more reasonable to make the \nextraterritorial application of RICO coextensive  with the extraterritorial application  of the relevant  predicate \nstatutes.โ).  The enterprise test, however, has been applied outside of the Second Circuit, and therefore, it is still a \nviable approach.   \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 22 of 32 PageID #:  7642\nforeign.  Moreover, Signal cites no portion of the factual record in making this argument and \ntherefore, has not demonstrated that this is a foreign enterprise.  The Plaintiffs, however, attached \nevidence that tends to show that the enterprises were driven primarily by Signal.  (Doc.

Therefore, at the very least, there is a fact issue as to whether this \nwould be a domestic enterprise under this approach. \nIn addition, under the Second Circuitโs recently minted test, the undersigned finds that \nRICO  liability  can  attach  to  Signalโs  conduct.    The  Second  Circuit  considers  whether  the \npredicate act has an extraterritorial reach.  European Cmty., 764 F.3d at 139.   If it does, then \nRICO liability can attach.  Id.  The court also held that โ[i]f domestic conduct satisfies every \nessential  element  to  prove  a  violation  of  a  United  States  statute  that  does  not  apply \nextraterritorially, that statute is violated even if some further conduct contributing to the violation \noccurred outside the United States.โ  Id. at 142.  Here, the Plaintiffs rely on three predicate acts: \ntrafficking, mail fraud, and wire fraud.  As discussed above, the Plaintiffsโ trafficking claim is \ndomestic, therefore, RICO liability can attach.  As for mail and wire fraud, while these statutes do \nnot apply extraterritorially, the Plaintiffs have made sufficient allegations that Signal, along with \nthe other Defendants, used the United States mail and wire systems to further their scheme.  See \nid.  (noting that because โ[t]he complaint alleges that defendants hatched schemes to defraud in \nthe United States, and that they used the U.S. mails and wires in furtherance of these schemes and \nwith the intent to do so,โ the domestic conduct satisfied every element essential element, and \ntherefore, RICO liability could attach).  Furthermore, Signal has pointed to nothing in the record \nshowing that the alleged mail and wire fraud occurred only abroad.  (See also Doc. No. 2115, \nDavid v. Signal Intโl, L.L.C., 2:08-cv-1220 (E.D. La. Jan. 9, 2014)).    \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 23 of 32 PageID #:  7643\nTherefore, under any of the above approaches, Signal is not entitled to summary judgment \non the Plaintiffsโ RICO claims.   \nc.  Involuntary servitude/slavery \n  Signal also seeks โpartial summary judgment on the claims alleging violations of 18 U.S.C. \nยงยง 1583, 1584, and implicitly, the Thirteenth Amendment.โ  (Doc. No. 161, pp. 34โ35.)  The \nPlaintiffs,  however,  have  abandoned  their  reliance  on  these  statutes.    Accordingly,  the \nundersigned need not address Signalโs arguments as to these claims.  \nd.  Conspiracy \nSignal argues that the Plaintiffsโ claim under ยง1962(d) should be dismissed because \nโPlaintiffs lack the evidence required to establish a triable issue concerning the scienter ยง 1962(d) \nrequires under countless federal authorities.โ  (Id. at p. 38.)  According to Signal, โmissing is \nproof that cognitively, Signal subjectively entertained the required mens rea to defraud, i.e., knew \nat  the  time  that  statements  concerning  green  cards,  in  that  context,  were  fraudulent \nstatements . . . .โ  (Doc. No. 187, p. 8.)    \n  โIn  order  to  demonstrate  a  RICO  conspiracy  under  ยง1962(d),  [the  Plaintiffs]  must \ndemonstrate โ(1) that two or more people agreed to commit a substantive RICO offense and (2) \nthat [the defendant] knew of and agreed to the overall object of the RICO offense.โโ  Chaney v. \nDreyfus Serv. Corp., 595 F.3d 219, 239 (5th Cir. 2010) (quoting United States v. Sharpe, 193 F.3d \n825, 869 (5th Cir. 1999)).  โA conspirator must at least know of the conspiracy and โadopt the \ngoal of furthering or facilitating the criminal endeavor.โโ  Id. (quoting Salinas v. United States, \n522 U.S. 52, 65 (1997)). \n  Signal is not entitled to summary judgment on the Plaintiffsโ ยง 1962(d) claim for two \nreasons.  First, Signal has not carried its burden.  Signal merely offers the conclusion that the \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 24 of 32 PageID #:  7644\nPlaintiffs have no evidence that Signal had the requisite intent to defraud and does not cite to any \nportion of the record in making this argument.  โIt is not enough for the moving party to merely \nmake a conclusory statement that the other party has no evidence to prove his case.โ  See Celotex \nCorp., 477 U.S. at 328 (White, J. concurring); see also Ash v. Corley, 992 F.2d 540, 543 (5th Cir. \n1993) (โBefore the non-moving party is required to produce evidence in opposition to [a motion \nfor summary judgment], the moving party must first satisfy its obligation of demonstrating that \nthere are no factual issues warranting trial.โ) (citation omitted).  While Signal does not have to \nโnegate the elements of the nonmovantโs case,โ Signal must offer more than the mere assertion \nthat the Plaintiffs cannot prove their case.  See Little, 37 F.3d at 1075; see also Seastrunk v. \nDarwell Integrated Tech., No. 3:05-cv-0531, 2008 WL 190316, at *2โ3 (N.D. Tex. Jan. 22, 2008) \n(โThe moving party, while not needing to produce evidence, must at least identify portions of the \nrecord that demonstrate an absence of evidence.โ).       \n  Second, despite Signal not meeting its burden, the Plaintiffs put forth enough evidence to \ndemonstrate the existence of a genuine dispute of material fact.  The Plaintiffs offer, amongst \nother evidence, the deposition of Sachin Dewan, who testified that Signal knew he had made false \npromises of permanent residency.  (Doc. No. 183, p. 34.)10  This evidence creates a triable issue \nas to whether Signal knew of the false promises, yet participated in the conspiracy by continuing to \nuse Dewan to recruit the Plaintiffs and facilitate the illicit scheme.  See Provident Life & Acc. Ins. \nCo. v. Goel, 274 F.3d 984, 991 (5th Cir. 2001) (โCredibility determinations, the weighing of \nevidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are the jury functions, not those \n                                                   \n10.  The Plaintiffs cite excerpts from the deposition of Sachin Dewan that were not attached to their motion.  \nThis is not fatal to their argument for several reasons.  First, as discussed above, Signal failed to meet its burden on \nthis issue.  Therefore, the Plaintiffs did not have to come forward with any evidence.  Second, the excerpts were \nattached to the plaintiffsโ motion in the parallel case of Samuel.  (See Doc. No. 188, Ex. 36, Samuel v. Signal Intโl, \nL.L.C., No. 1:13-cv-323 (E.D. Tex. Nov. 4, 2014)).  Therefore, the undersigned was able to review them.  Third, \nother evidence creates a fact issue as to whether Signal knew of the promises that were allegedly made by Dewan.  \n(See Doc. No. 183, Ex. 25) (meeting notes from a Signal employee noting that promises of a green card may have been \nmade).   \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 25 of 32 PageID #:  7645\nof a judge . . . .The evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are \nto be drawn in his favor.โ) (citations omitted).  \n  In sum, in light of the Plaintiffsโ evidence, there is a fact issue as to what Signal knew, \nwhen Signal knew it, and Signalโs level of participation in the overall scheme.  Accordingly, \nsummary judgment on the Plaintiffsโ conspiracy claim is not warranted.  \nC.  Claim Four: Violations of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. ยง 1985(3)) \nIn the Plaintiffsโ fourth claim for relief, they seek damages under 42 U.S.C. ยง1985(3) \nclaiming  that  Defendants  โconspired,  agreed,  planned  and  coordinated  for  the  purpose  of \ndepriving Plaintiffs of equal protection of their rights under the Thirteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution and its implementing and enforcing statutes (inter alia, 18 U.S.C. \nยงยง1589, 1590) to be free from forced labor, involuntary servitude, and trafficking in persons.โ  \n(Doc. No. 64, p. 65.)  The Plaintiffsโ complaint lists three separate and distinct acts that allegedly \nviolate ยง 1985(3): involuntary servitude, forced labor, and trafficking.  (Id.)  Unlike their claims \nunder the TVPRA and RICO, the Plaintiffs did not abandon their claim of involuntary servitude as \nto their ยง1985(3) cause of action.  Signal moves for summary judgment on two grounds.  First, \nSignal claims that the evidence negates the Plaintiffsโ claim.  (Doc. No. 161, p. 39) (โ[T]here is no \ngenuine issue of material fact concerning the truth that the plaintiffs knew that they were free to \nleave Signal whenever they wanted, even if leaving was in some sense painful . . . .โ).  Second, \nthat ยงยง 1589 and 1590 are not actionable under ยง1985(3).   \na.  Definition of involuntary servitude under ยง1985(3) \nSection 1985(3) states:  \nIf two or more persons in any State or Territory conspire . . . for the purpose of \ndepriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal \nprotection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws . . . the \nparty so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damages.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 26 of 32 PageID #:  7646\n \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1985(3).  The Supreme Court has recognized only two rights protected by this statute: \nthe right to interstate travel and the right to be free from involuntary servitude.  See Bray v. \nAlexandria Womenโs Health Clinic, 506 U.S. 263, 278 (1993). \n  At issue here is how broadly to interpret โinvoluntary servitudeโ under ยง1985(3).  Signal \nargues that the definition, as stated in United States v. Kozminski, 487 U.S. 931 (1988), is \ncontrolling.  (Doc. No. 161, pp. 35โ38.)  In Kozminski, two men were convicted under 18 U.S.C. \nยง 241, which โprohibits conspiracy to interfere with an individualโs Thirteenth Amendment right \nto be from โinvoluntary servitude,โโ and 18 U.S.C. ยง 1584, which โmakes it a crime [to] knowingly \nand willfully hold another person โto involuntary servitude.โโ  Kozminski, 487 U.S. at 934.  The \nissue in Kozminzki was โthe meaning of โinvoluntary servitudeโโ under these two statutes.  Id. at \n939.  The Court held that โinvoluntary servitudeโ was to be narrowly construed and limited to \nโthe use or threat of physical restraint or physical injury, or by the use or threat of coercion through \nlaw or the legal process.โ  Id. at 952.  The Court considered statutes implementing the Thirteenth \nAmendment, and found that Congress had not undertaken to broadly define involuntary servitude, \nand โthat nothing in the history of the Slave Trade statute [the precursor to ยง1584] suggests that it \nwas intended to extend to conditions of servitude beyond those applied to slaves, i.e., physical or \nlegal coercion.โ  Id. at 946โ47.   \n  Congress, however, expressly repudiated Kozminskiโs narrow definition of involuntary \nservitude with the passage of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000.  \nKiwanuka, 844 F. Supp. 2d at 115โ16 (โKozminski is not controlling, as Congress has specifically \naddressed the Kozminski decision and rejected it as too narrow.โ).  This Act broadened the \ndefinition of involuntary servitude to โinclude cases in which persons are held in a condition of \nservitude through nonviolent coercion.โ  See Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 27 of 32 PageID #:  7647\nof 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-386, 114 Stat. 1446, 1467 (codified at 22 U.S.C. ยง 7101).  Specifically, \ninvoluntary servitude is defined as โany scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to \nbelieve that, if the person did not enter into or continue in such a condition, that person or another \nperson would suffer serious harm or physical restraint.โ  22 U.S.C. ยง 7102(6) (emphasis added). \n  Here,  the  expanded  definition  of  โinvoluntary  servitudeโ  defeats  Signalโs  motion.11  \nSignal simply argues that because the Plaintiffs were physically free to leave, there can be no claim \nfor involuntary servitude.  (Doc. No. 161, p. 39) (โ[T]he statement of Undisputed Facts above \ndemonstrates that the Plaintiffs recognized that they could have left Signal physically if they had \nchosen to.  Under Kozminski, the claims of slavery and involuntary servitude are therefore \ninsupportable.โ).    However,  as  discussed  above,  after  2000,  involuntary  servitude  now \nencompasses  nonviolent  coercion  and  threats  of  serious  harm.    A  review  of  the  evidence \ndemonstrates that the Plaintiffs have put forth enough evidence to create a fact issue as to whether \nthey have satisfied the current definition of involuntary servitude.  For instance, each of the \nPlaintiffs testified that Signal threatened them with deportation.  (See Doc. No. 183, pp. 4โ9.)  In \naddition, the Plaintiffs put forth evidence that the large debts they undertook left them with no \nviable alternative but to continue working for Signal.  (Id.)  While the threats of deportation and \nfinancial coercion may not have been actionable under Kozminkzi, it is these types of โnonviolent \ncoercionโ that Congress sought to reach with the passage of the Victims of Trafficking and \nViolence Protection Act of 2000.  Therefore, the mere fact that the Plaintiffs were physically free \nto leave Signalโs facility does not entitle Signal to judgment as a matter of law, and the Plaintiffs \nhave come forward with enough evidence to create a fact issue as to whether they were victims of \ninvoluntary servitude. \n                                                   \n11.  The civil remedy provision of the TVPRA did not extend to 18 U.S.C. ยง 1584โthe crime of involuntary \nservitudeโuntil 2008.  However, because ยง 1985(3) provides the remedy, not 18 U.S.C. ยง 1595, finding Signal liable \nfor damages for conspiracy to commit involuntary servitude would not be a retroactive application of ยง 1595. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 28 of 32 PageID #:  7648\nb.  ยงยง1589 and 1590 are actionable under ยง1985(3) \nAt the outset, is unclear whether Signal is actually seeking dismissal of the Plaintiffsโ \nclaims under ยง1985(3) to the extent that they are relying on violations of ยงยง 1589 and 1590.  \n(Compare Doc. No. 161, p. 34) (seeking a pro tanto dismissal of certain portions of the Plaintiffsโ \nRICO claim).  The Plaintiffsโ claim for relief under ยง1985(3) is predicated on involuntary \nservitude, in addition to forced labor and trafficking.  As discussed above, Signal is not entitled to \nsummary judgment on the involuntary servitude prong of the Plaintiffsโ claim.  However, Signal \nalso argues that dismissal is warranted because โยง1985(3) does not reach trafficking and forced \nlabor.โ  (Id. at p. 40) (citing David v. Signal Intโl, L.L.C., No. 08-1220, 2012 WL 10759668, at \n*36 (E.D. La. Jan. 4, 2012)).  The undersigned, however, finds that private conspiracies to violate \nยงยง 1589 or 1590, that are motivated by racial animus, are actionable under ยง 1985(3).  Therefore, \nSignal is not entitled to summary judgment.  \n Section 1985(3) is not a source of rights, rather โthe rights, privileges and immunities that \nยง 1985(3) vindicates must be found elsewhere . . . .โ  United Broth. of Carpenters & Joiners of \nAm. v. Scott, 462 U.S. 825, 833 (1983).  One of the rights protected by this section is the right to \nbe free from involuntary servitude.  Therefore, if ยงยง1589 and 1590 are statutes that enforce the \nThirteenth Amendment (as the Plaintiffs argue), then a conspiracy to violate these statutes should \nbe actionable under ยง 1985(3).  See, e.g., Wells v. Rhodes, 928 F. Supp. 2d 920, 930โ31 (S.D. \nOhio 2013) (holding that โยง 1982 provides an adequate basis for a private conspiracy claim under \nยง 1985(3) . . . [because] ยง 1982 protects citizens against private infringements in their property \nrights . . . [and] shares a close relationship with the Thirteenth Amendment, which the Supreme \nCourt has recognized as a source of rights for ยง 1985(3).โ). \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 29 of 32 PageID #:  7649\nCourts have found that ยง 1589 is โan exercise of Congressional power under Section Two \nof the Thirteenth Amendment.โ12  John Roe I v. Bridgestone Corp., 492 F. Supp. 988, 1003 (S.D. \nInd. 2007); United States v. Toviave, 761 F.3d 623, 629 (6th Cir. 2014) (noting that ยง 1589 was \npassed to implement the Thirteenth Amendment); United States v. Garcia, No. 02-cr-1105-01, \n2003 WL 22938040,  at *2โ3 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 2, 2003) (rejecting  a  claim  that ยง1589 was \nunconstitutional because Congress lacked power under the commerce clause, and holding that \nยง1589 was a โproper exercise of Congressโs power under the Thirteenth Amendmentโ); see also 22 \nU.S.C. ยง 7101(b)(22) (โThe right to be free from slavery and involuntary servitude is among those \ninalienable rights.  Acknowledging this fact, the United States outlawed slavery and involuntary \nservitude in 1865, recognizing them as evil institutions that must be abolished.  Current practices \nof sexual slavery and trafficking of women and children are similarly abhorrent to the principles \nupon which the United States was founded.โ).  Moreover, Congress is afforded wide latitude to \nboth define modern forms of slavery and involuntary servitude, as well as to enact legislation to \ncombat these insidious institutions.  In discussing Congressโs power under ยง 2 of the Thirteenth \nAmendment, the Fifth Circuit recognized that:  \n[T]he Supreme Court held [in Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409 (1968)] \nthat the scope of Congressโs power was not limited to measures intended to end \nstructures of slavery in a literal or a formal sense.  Instead, the Supreme Court held \nthat Congress has the authority to enact legislation necessary to abolish โbadgesโ \nand โincidentsโ of slavery, as well as the power to rationally determine what those \nโbadgesโ and โincidentsโ are. \n \nUnited States v. Cannon, 750 F.3d 492, 499 (5th Cir. 2014) (holding that the Matthew Shepard and \nJames Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 was a valid exercise of Congressional power \nunder the Thirteenth Amendment).  Therefore, because ยง 1985(3) protects the right to be free \nfrom involuntary servitude, and ยงยง 1589 and 1590 define and outlaw modern day manifestations of \n                                                   \n12.  But see H.R. Rep. No. 106-487, pt. 2, at 27 (2000) (noting that the โConstitutional Authorityโ for the act \nis โArticle I, section 8, clause 4 of the Constitutionโ). \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 30 of 32 PageID #:  7650\ninvoluntary  servitude  and  slavery,  it  follows  that  conspiracies  to  violate  these  statutes  are \nactionable under ยง 1985(3). \n  The only other case that has addressed this specific issue is David, which is not binding.  \nThe court in David found that โthe [Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000], \nwhich sought to criminalize involuntary servitude based [on] other forms of coercion, did not \nchange the scope of the Thirteenth Amendment.โ  David, 2012 WL 10759668, at *36.  The \nundersigned, however, respectfully disagrees with the David courtโs reasoning in finding that a \nprivate conspiracy to violate ยงยง 1589 or 1590 is not actionable under ยง 1985(3).  First, the court in \nDavid found that extending the reach of ยง 1985(3) would lead to โevery criminal statute that \ninvolves a victim [] potentially giv[ing] rise to a โrightโโ under ยง 1985(3).  Id. at *36 n. 50.  \nSection 1985(3), however, has been on the books for nearly one hundred and fifty years and only \ntwo rights have been recognized: interstate travel and involuntary servitude.  See, e.g., Great Am. \nFed. Savs. & Loan Assโn v. Novotny, 442 U.S. 366, 378 (1979) (holding that the right to be free \nfrom workplace discrimination under Title VII was not actionable under ยง 1985(3)).  Moreover, \nfinding statutes that combat modern day involuntary servitude actionable under ยง 1985(3) does not \nexpand the rights protected by ยง1985, but merely clarifies the definition of involuntary servitude. \nSecond, the David court noted that interpreting ยง 1985(3) too broadly would โrender it โa \ngeneral federal tort lawโโ which would be โcontrary to the admonition that the Supreme Court has \nlong held since Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88, 91 (1971) . . . .โ  Id. at *36 n. 50.  Griffin, \nhowever, held that a necessary element under ยง 1985(3) is that โthere must be some racial, or \nperhaps  otherwise  class-based,  invidiously  discriminatory  animus  behind  the  conspiratorsโ \nactions.โ  See Griffin, 403 U.S. at 102.  This requirement limits the reach of private conspiracies \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 219   Filed 02/04/15   Page 31 of 32 PageID #:  7651\nunder ยง 1985(3) and prevents it from becoming a federal tort law.  Accordingly, the undersigned \ndoes not share the David courtโs concerns.   \nTherefore, the undersigned finds that Signal is not entitled to summary judgment on the \nPlaintiffsโ ยง1985(3) claim, regardless of whether it is predicated on involuntary servitude, forced \nlabor, or trafficking. \nIV. Recommendation \n  For the reasons stated above, the undersigned recommends that Signalโs โMotion for \nPartial Summary Judgmentโ (Doc. No. 161) be DENIED. \nV. Objections \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(c) (Supp. IV 2011), each party to this action has the right \nto file objections to this report and recommendation.  Objections to this report must (1) be in \nwriting, (2) specifically identify those findings or recommendations to which the party objects, (3) \nbe served and filed within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this report; and (4) \nbe no more than eight pages in length.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(c); Fed R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2); \nLocal Rule CV-72(c).  A party who objects to this report is entitled to a de novo determination by \nthe United States District Judge of those proposed findings and recommendations to which a \nspecific objection is timely made.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(c); Fed R. Civ.

      "text": "Case 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 148   Filed 10/15/14   Page 1 of 21 PageID #:  2719\n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS \nBEAUMONT DIVISION \n \nBIJU MAKRUKKATTU JOSEPH, et al.  ' \n  ' \nv.    '    1:13-CV-324 \n  ' \nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL L.L.C.,   ' \net al.  ' \n \n \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER ON SIGNALโS MOTION TO COMPEL (DOC. NO. 127)  \n \nThis case is assigned to the Honorable Ron Clark, United States District Judge, and is \nreferred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge for pretrial proceedings pursuant to a \nreferral order entered on May 22, 2013.  (Doc. No. 4.)  Pending before the undersigned is the \nโSignal Defendantsโ Motion to Compelโ (Doc. No. 127) filed by Signal International, L.L.C., \nSignal International, Inc., Signal International Texas, G.P., and Signal International Texas, L.P. \n(collectively, โSignalโ).  This motion centers on the resolution of one issueโto what extent does \nthe in terrorem effect preclude discovery into the Plaintiffsโ โimmigration status, immigration \nhistory, employment history, and personal information.โ  (Doc. No. 137, p. 14.)  \nSignal seeks to compel production of the Plaintiffsโ โdriversโ licenses, visas, employment \nauthorization documents issued by the United States, T visa applications, passports with visa \nstamps, documents relating to a plaintiffโs involvement in or with social media, and writings \nrelating to the plaintiffโs first paycheck from a source other than Signal.โ  (Doc. No. 127, p. 1.)  \nMost of Signalโs motion is dedicated to its need for the Plaintiffsโ T visas, which is a visa \navailable specifically to victims of human trafficking that allows those who qualify to stay in the \nUnited States for up to four years, and may even lead to permanent residence.  The Plaintiffs \nresist production on three grounds.  First, they claim that requiring production of documents that \nmay reveal personal information or immigration status would โharass, embarrass, and oppress \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 148   Filed 10/15/14   Page 2 of 21 PageID #:  2720\n \nPlaintiffs . . . and otherwise chill legitimate claims against illegal activity.โ  (Doc. No. 137, p. 1, \n4โ7, 11)  This is known as the in terrorem effect.  Second, that there is a statutory privilege, \nparticularly as related to the Plaintiffsโ visas.  (Id. at 7โ9.)  Third, in its objections to discovery \npropounded by the Plaintiffs, Signal claimed that anything occurring after the Plaintiffs ceased \nworking for Signal was irrelevant.  Therefore, the Plaintiffs contend that Signal cannot not now \nseek to compel documents from this period.  (Id. at p. 9โ10.)  In turn, the Plaintiffs request that a \nprotective order be entered preventing discovery into โimmigration status, immigration history, \nemployment history, and personal information of Plaintiffs or their families after Plaintiffsโ \nemployment with the Signal was terminated.โ  (Id. at p. 14.)  \nAfter considering the partiesโ briefing and applicable authorities, the undersigned grants \nin part and denies in part Signalโs motion.  Specifically, as to Signalโs request for the Plaintiffsโ \nT visas and employment authorization documents, given the nature and stage of this case, and \nthe  fact  that  the  documents  are  both  relevant  and  discoverable,  the  undersigned  finds  that \nSignalโs need for the information outweighs any potential in terrorem effect.  Therefore, the \nundersigned grants Signalโs motion as to the visas and employment authorization documents.  As \nfor  Plaintiffsโ driverโs licenses, passports  with  visa stamps, and  first  post-Signal  paycheck, \nSignal failed to meet its burden of why it needs this information.  In addition, because Signal has \nresisted discovery of information from the period after the Plaintiffs stopped working for Signal, \non the grounds that it is irrelevant, Signal cannot now claim that this information is discoverable.  \nAccordingly, Signalโs motion as it relates to these items is denied.   \nAs to the Plaintiffsโ request to enter a protective order (Doc. No. 137), the undersigned \nfinds that the Plaintiffs have failed to show good cause why discovery on certain topics should be \ncompletely  precluded.    The  information  that  the  Plaintiffs  seek  to  protect  is  relevant  and \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 148   Filed 10/15/14   Page 3 of 21 PageID #:  2721\n \ndiscoverable.  However, should Signal seek discovery that is clearly irrelevant and solely aimed \nat harassment, particularly extensive discovery regarding the Plaintiffsโ relatives or third parties, \nthe undersigned will at that time consider whether judicially imposed limits are necessary.   \nI. Background \n1.  Factual Background \n  The Plaintiffs are thirty-three Indian men who allege that they are victims of human \ntrafficking.  (Doc. No. 64, pp. 2, 5โ12.)  The Plaintiffs assert that Signal, along with several other \ndefendants, lured them into this country with the false promise that if they adequately performed \nwork for Signal, that this could be a pathway to โlegal and permanent work-based immigration to \nthe United States . . . .โ  (Id. at 2.)  Based on these allegedly false promises and misleading \nstatements, the Plaintiffs paid significant sums of money to obtain work papers and visas to come \nto the United States.  (Id.)  Once here, the Plaintiffs claim to have found themselves in deplorable \nliving and working conditions, as well as subject to threats of โloss of immigration status and \ndeportation, and . . . a campaign of psychological abuse, coercion, and fraud designed to render \nPlaintiffs afraid, intimidated, and unable to leave Signalโs employ.โ  (Id. at p. 3.)   \n2.  Procedural Background \nThis  case  has  its  origins  in  a  putative  class  action  filed  in  the  Eastern  District  of \nLouisiana.  (See Doc. No. 1, David v. Signal Intโl, L.L.C., 2:08-cv-01220 (E.D. La. March 7, \n2008)).  Class certification was denied, which caused the individual putative class members to \nfile suit in the districts where their injuries allegedly occurred.  (See Doc. No. 1117, David, 2:08-\ncv-01220 (E.D. La. Jan 4, 2012)).  Cases were filed in the Eastern District of Texas, the Eastern \nDistrict of Louisiana, and the Southern District of Mississippi.  The Mississippi cases were \nconsolidated and transferred to the Eastern District of Louisiana under the โfirst-to-fileโ rule.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 148   Filed 10/15/14   Page 4 of 21 PageID #:  2722\n \n(See Doc. No. 44, Achari v. Signal Intโl, L.L.C., No. 1:13-cv-222 (S.D. Miss. Oct. 18, 2013)).  In \naddition, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed suit in the Southern District of \nMississippi alleging multiple Title VII violations that was also transferred to the Eastern District \nof Louisiana.  (See Doc. No. 52, EEOC v. Signal Intโl, L.L.C., No. 1:11-cv-179 (S.D. Miss. Feb. \n29, 2012)).  All of the cases in the Eastern District of Louisiana are pending in the same court.  \nThe court in the Eastern District of Louisiana court has severely limited discovery related \nto immigration status.  (Doc. No. 125, p. 5.);  see also David v. Signal Intโl, L.L.C., 257 F.R.D. \n114, 126 (E.D. La. 2009) (โ[A]ny inquiry into plaintiffsโ current immigration status, current \nresidence and/or post-termination employment history will most assuredly strike paralyzing fear \nin the plaintiffs sufficient to chill any inclination they may have had to prosecute their pending \nclaims.โ).  The Plaintiffs argue that โ[t]o require disclosure in this case would not only conflict \nwith other protective orders in the Related Cases, it would also allow the Signal Defendants to \ncircumvent those orders and obtain discovery other courts have excluded.โ  (Doc. No. 137, p. 6.)  \nThe undersigned is confident, however, that to the extent any order entered in this case conflicts \nwith an order entered in a related case pending in the Eastern District of Louisiana, any impact \ncan be ameliorated by proper limits on the dissemination and use of the information produced. \nIII. Legal Standard \n โGenerally,  the  scope  of  discovery  is  broad  and  permits  the  discovery  of  โany \nnonprivileged matter that is relevant to any partyโs claim or defense.โโ  Crosby v. La. Health \nServ. & Indem. Co., 647 F.3d 258, 261 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting FED. R. CIV. P. 26(b)(1)).  โA \ndiscovery request is relevant when the request seeks admissible evidence or โis reasonably \ncalculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.โโ  Id. (quoting Wiwa v. Royal Dutch \nPetroleum Co., 392 F.3d 812, 820 (5th Cir. 2004)).  Moreover, โa district court has broad \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 148   Filed 10/15/14   Page 5 of 21 PageID #:  2723\n \ndiscretion in all discovery matters, and such discretion will not be disturbed ordinarily unless \nthere are unusual circumstances showing a clear abuse.โ  Beattie v. Madison Cnty. Sch. Dist., \n254 F.3d 595, 606 (5th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted). \nโOn notice to other parties and all affected persons, a party may move for an order \ncompelling  . . . discovery.โ  FED. R. CIV. P. 37(a)(1).  โThe moving party bears the burden of \nshowing that the materials and information sought are relevant to the action or will lead to the \ndiscovery of admissible evidence.โ  Marin v. Gilberg, Civ. A. No. V-07-62, 2009 WL 426061, at \n*2 (S.D. Tex. Feb. 19, 2009).  If the moving party meets its burden, โthe burden then shifts to the \nparty  resisting discovery  to  show why the discovery is  irrelevant,  overly  broad, or unduly \nburdensome or oppressive, and thus should not be permitted.โ  Id.  \nIn addition, โto protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or \nundue burden or expense,โ a party may move for a protective order under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 26(c).  The party seeking a protective order bears the burden to show that good cause \nexists.  See In re Terra Intโl, Inc., 134 F.3d 302, 306 (5th Cir. 1998).  The Fifth Circuit has noted \nthat this requires showing โโa particular and specific demonstration of fact as distinguished from \nstereotyped and conclusory statements.โโ  Id. (quoting United States v. Garret, 571 F.2d 1323, \n1326 n. 3 (5th Cir. 1978)); compare Topo v. Dhir, 210 F.R.D. 76, 77โ78 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) \n(rejecting the idea that โprotective orders must be supported by concrete factual showingsโ and \nnoting that some courts only require โgood causeโ) (citations omitted).    \nIV. Analysis \nSignal  seeks  to  compel  the  production  of  the  Plaintiffsโ  driverโs  licenses,  visas, \nemployment  authorization  documents  issued  by  the  United  States  government,  T  visa \napplications, passports with visa stamps, documents relating to involvement with social media, \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 148   Filed 10/15/14   Page 6 of 21 PageID #:  2724\n \nand writings relating to their first paycheck from a source other than Signal.  (Doc. No. 127, p. \n1.)  Signal does not identify which specific Requests for Production are at issue, but it appears \nthat Requests for Production Nos. 1โ8, 13, 14, and 47 call for this information.1  (Id., Ex.1.)  The \ninformation that Signal seeks can be grouped into two categories: documents related to the \nplaintiffsโ  immigration  status  (Requests  Nos.  5,  6,  7,  8)  and  general  personal  information \n(Requests Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 13, 14, 47).  Each set will be addressed separately. \na.  Documents related to the Plaintiffsโ immigration status \nRequests for Production Nos. 7 and 8 seek to compel production of the Plaintiffsโ T visas \nand  supporting  documents,  and  Requests  for  Production  Nos.  5  and  6  seek  employment \nauthorization documents.2  As will be discussed below, if a person qualifies for a T or U visa, \nthey  can  also  seek  employment  authorization.    Therefore,  because  these  documents  are \nsomewhat related and both could identify the Plaintiffsโ current immigration status, they will be \naddressed together.  \ni.  Background on T and U visas \nT and U visas were created with the passage of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence \nPrevention Act (โVTVPAโ).  See Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, \nPub. L. No. 106-386, ยงยง 107, 1513, 114 Stat. 1464, 1477โ79, 1534โ37.  The T visa is available \nto unauthorized immigrants who have been victims of human trafficking, whereas a U visa is \n                                                 \n1.  Signal failed to specially identify which of its seventy-two requests for production are at issue.  The \nidentified requests are the undersignedโs best guess.  See Hart v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 270 F.R.D. 166, 169 \n(D. Del. 2010) (denying a motion to compel and noting that because the plaintiff failed to identify which of the \nsixty-five requests were at issue that the plaintiffs โfailed to provide the necessary specificity to allow the Court to \ncompel Defendant to reply to any individual requestโ).    \n \n2.  Signalโs motion seeks to compel production of both T and U visas, but Signal did not specifically \nrequest the U visa in its Requests for Production.  (Doc. No. 127.)  The Plaintiffs, however, do not raise this as a \nreason not to produce the U visas.  Given the similarity of the T and U visas, the undersigned will consider \ncompelling production of both.  \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 148   Filed 10/15/14   Page 7 of 21 PageID #:  2725\n \navailable to victims of โqualifying criminal activity.โ  See 8 C.F.R. ยงยง 214.11 (T visa); 214.14 \n(U visa).  The Code of Federal Regulations contains a laundry list of โqualifying criminal \nactivity,โ which includes such crimes as trafficking, involuntary servitude, and slave trade.  Id. \nยง 214.14(a)(9).   \nThe T and U visas share some important characteristics that are relevant to this case.  \nFirst, they are available to not only the victim, but also certain family members of the victim.  Id. \nยงยง  214.11(o)  (T  visa);  214.14(f)  (U  visa).    Second,  both  require  cooperation  with  law \nenforcement.  To obtain a T visa, the victim must comply with any reasonable requests from a \nlaw enforcement agency for assistance in the investigation or prosecution of human trafficking.  \nId. ยง 214.11(h).  Similarly, to obtain a U visa, a victim must have been โhelpful, is being helpful, \nor is  likely to  be helpful  to  a certifying agency  in  the investigation or prosecution of the \nqualifying criminal activity upon which his or her petition is based . . . .โ  Id. ยง 214.14(b)(3).  \nThird, each visa is valid for four years, and after a period of three years, the victim may seek \npermanent residence.  Id. ยงยง 245.23(a) (T visa); 241.14(g) (U visa).  Lastly, each visa authorizes \nthe victim to lawfully obtain employment.  Id. ยงยง 214.11(l) (T visa); 214.14(i)(7) (U visa).        \nii.  Signal has met its burden \nAs the movant, it is Signalโs burden to demonstrate that this information is discoverable.  \nSignal argues that because there are substantial benefits derived from obtaining one of these \nvisas, there may be an incentive for the Plaintiffs to fabricate their claims or exaggerate the \nextent of the harm that they suffered as a result of Signalโs actions in order to acquire such a visa.  \nTherefore,  according  to  Signal,  the  visas  and  employment  authorization  documents  are \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 148   Filed 10/15/14   Page 8 of 21 PageID #:  2726\n \ndiscoverable because they may be probative of the Plaintiffsโ motives.3  \n  The information that Signal seeks falls within the broad scope of discovery.  FED. R. CIV. \nP. 26(b) (โParties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to \nany partyโs claim or defense . . .โ and โrelevant information need not be admissible at the trial if \nthe discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.โ).4  \nInformation in the visas and visa applications may shed light on Signalโs claim that the Plaintiffs \nโmanufactured  their  allegations  against  Signal,โ  or  could  at  least  lead  to  the  discovery  of \nadmissible evidence.  (Doc. No. 122, p. 4.)  For example, in the T visa application, under penalty \nof perjury, a victim must check a box stating that they are a victim of severe trafficking.  The \napplicant is also requested to explain certain answers, such as whether they will suffer extreme \nhardship if removed from the United States, and whether they have reported these acts to law \nenforcement, as well as submit a โpersonal narrative statement describing the trafficking.โ5  See \nI-914, Application for T Nonimmigrant Status, http://www.uscis.gov/i-914.  Moreover, a law \nenforcement officer may also fill out a form, where they mark a box on whether the applicant has \nbeen  a  victim  of  trafficking  and  describing  the  victimization.    See  I-914,  Supplement  B, \nDeclaration  of  Law  Enforcement  Officer  for  Victim  of  Trafficking  in  Persons, \nhttp://www.uscis.gov/i-914 (noting that a person may qualify for a T visa without this form, but \n                                                 \n3.  Signal devotes much of its motion to arguments related to the confrontation clause and its constitutional \nrights to discovery.  These arguments are misplaced.  The confrontation clause, by its terms, only applies in the \ncriminal setting.  U.S. CONST. amend. VI (โIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be \nconfronted with the witnesses against him.โ) (emphasis added).  In a civil case, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \ndictate Signalโs rights to information.  So long as this court does not clearly abuse its discretion in applying these \nrules and completely deprive Signal of access to discovery (which in an extreme case may potentially be a due \nprocess violation), Signalโs constitutional rights will have been protected. \n \n4.  See also Local Civil Rule CV-26(d) (noting that information is discoverable if โit is information that is \nlikely to have an influence on or affect the outcome of a claim or defenseโ or โthat deserves to be considered in the \npreparation, evaluation or trial of a claim or defenseโ). \n \n5.  The Plaintiffs claim that redacted affidavits attached to their visa applications have been produced.  \n(Doc. No. 125, p. 3 n. 1.) \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 148   Filed 10/15/14   Page 9 of 21 PageID #:  2727\n \nโsubmission of the Supplement B is strongly advisedโ).  Signal is entitled to know what boxes, if \nany, were checked by the Plaintiffs or law enforcement, and any proffered descriptions, which \nwould necessarily relate to the events giving rise to this lawsuit.   \nIn addition, Signal is likely to argue that if there is any wrongdoing, the other defendants \nare  to  blame.6   The  information  contained  in  the  visa  application,  particularly  information \ndescribing the instances of trafficking or other alleged crimes, may be informative as to whether \nthe any of the Plaintiffs places blame on Signal or another codefendant.  While the undersigned \nis not determining at this juncture whether such evidence will be admissible at trial, it is not \nbeyond belief that it might, at the very least, lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  \nTherefore, Signal has met its burden of demonstrating this information is discoverable.   \niii.  The burden shifts to the Plaintiffs \n  The Plaintiffs argue that they should not be compelled to produce immigration related \ndocuments on three grounds.  First, because Signal previously claimed that documents from the \ntime that Plaintiffs stopped working for Signal are irrelevant, Signal cannot now claim that this \ninformation  is  discoverable.   Second,  that  these  documents  are  privileged  under  8  U.S.C. \nยง 1367(a), and as such, Plaintiffs cannot be compelled to produce these documents.  Third, \nproducing these documents would have an in terrorem effect on the Plaintiffs, as well as other \nvictims of trafficking, and therefore, social policies trump Signalโs need for the visas. \n1.  The immigration documents are relevant \n  As to the Plaintiffsโ first argument, the undersigned finds that the Plaintiffsโ T and U \nvisas cannot be classified as merely documents relating to the Plaintiffsโ post-Signal activities.  \n                                                 \n6.  Signal has yet to file an answer in this case.  In a parallel case, however, Signal filed a cross-claim \nagainst the other defendants, alleging: โPlaintiffsโ suit alleges that Signal was part of a concerted wrongdoing \ndirected at foreign workers.  However, Signal was a victim of the cross claim defendantsโ actions rather than a \nwilling participant.โ  (See Doc. No. 79, Samuel v. Signal Intโl, L.L.C., No. 1:13-cv-323 (E.D. Tex. April 17, 2014)). \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 148   Filed 10/15/14   Page 10 of 21 PageID #:  2728\n \nFirst, it is unclear when, or even if, any of Plaintiffs sought these visas.  It is plausible that if any \nPlaintiffs applied for these visas, they did so while still employed at Signal.  Moreover, these \ndocuments will likely contain factual statements and assertions about the Plaintiffsโ experiences \nrelated to their trafficking and their experiences while employed by Signal.  Accordingly, even if \nthe Plaintiffs applied for these visas after they left Signal, the information contained in the \napplications is not simply information related to Plaintiffsโ post-Signal activities.  Therefore, \nPlaintiffsโ  objection  on  relevancy  grounds  is  not  sufficient  to  deny  Signal  access  to  these \ndocuments. \n2.  8 U.S.C. ยง 1367(a) is not an absolute privilege \n \nPlaintiffs argue that the confidentiality provision of 8 U.S.C. ยง 1367(a) prohibits the \nundersigned from compelling the production of the Plaintiffsโ T visa applications and related \nmaterials.  Section 1367 generally prohibits the use or dissemination of information regarding \nwhether a person holds a T or U visa.  However, according to the plain language of the statue, it \nonly applies to:  \nthe Attorney General, or any other official or employee of the Department of \nJustice, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of State, or any other \nofficial or any other official or employee of the Department of Homeland Security \nor  Department  of  State  (including  any  bureau  or  agency  or  either  of  such \ndepartments) \n \n8 U.S.C. ยง 1367(a).  Thus, the statute does not apply to the discovery obligations of private \nlitigants.  Plaintiffs, however, argue that when read as whole, the statute confers a privilege that \nruns to the Plaintiffs.  Section 1376(a)(2) prohibits the above named agencies from โpermit[ting] \nuse by or disclosure to anyone . . . of any information which relates to an alien who is the \nbeneficiary of an application . . ,โ and ยง 1376(b)(4) creates an exception, allowing certain victims \nto waive the restrictions on use information.  The Plaintiffs argue that because ยง1376(b)(4) \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 148   Filed 10/15/14   Page 11 of 21 PageID #:  2729\n \nconfers a right of waiver, that it must also create a privilege.  In other words, ยง1376(b)(4) \nevidences a victimโs right not have to disclose this information, otherwise, there would be no \nreason for a corollary right to waive this privilege.  Therefore, according to the Plaintiffs, the \nundersigned cannot compel them to disclose this information against their will.   \n  Plaintiffs misread this statute.  This section might be applicable if Signal had made a \nFreedom of Information Act request to one of the named agencies.  See Hawke v. United States \nDepโt of Homeland Sec., No. C-07-03456, 2008 WL 4460241, *5โ7 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 29, 2008).  \nThen, if the Plaintiffs had not waived the right of non-disclosure, one of those agencies would be \nprohibited from disclosing this information.  Here, Signal has made the request on the Plaintiffs.  \nThe undersigned does not read this statute as conferring an absolute right of privilege on the \nPlaintiffs in this situation.  See Demaj v. Sakaj, No. 3:09-cv-255, 2012 WL 476168, at *6 (D. \nCon. Feb. 14, 2012) (noting that the statutory privilege only applied to the named agencies, and \nthat if the plaintiffs were in the possession of their immigration documents, they could be \ncompelled to produce them). \n  Moreover,  the  undersigned  does  not  find  that  requiring  the  Plaintiffs  to  disclose \ninformation related to their visas would undermine the purpose of the statue.  Had the Plaintiffs \nnot sued Signal, their immigration status would be privileged and Signal would have no right to \nobtain their visas, even if criminal charges were filed against Signal.  See Hawke, 2008 WL \n4460241 at *5โ7.  However, once a party decides to sue and seek money damages, the calculus \nchanges.  As discussed below, Signal has a right to defend itself, and in this case, the information \ncontained in the visas may contain relevant information.   \n3.  The in terrorem effect does not outweigh Signalโs need for the \ndocuments \n \nThe Plaintiffs next argue that, even if the visas are relevant, they should not be required \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 148   Filed 10/15/14   Page 12 of 21 PageID #:  2730\n \nto produce them because if forced to do so, it would dissuade them from prosecuting this case.  \nThis is known as the in terrorem effect, and has been invoked to preclude or limit discovery into \nsensitive topics, particularly immigration status.  \nThe in terrorem effect is predicated on two concepts.  First, that certain remedial statutes, \nin order to achieve their goals, rely on enforcement by private citizens.  See Rivera v. NIBCO, \nInc., 364 F.3d 1057, 1065โ66 (9th Cir. 2004) (discussing that โCongress intended to empower \nindividuals to act as private attorneys general in enforcing provisions of Title VII.โ); Kathleen \nKim, The Trafficked Worker as Private Attorney General: A Model for Enforcing the Civil \nRights of Undocumented Workers, 1 U. CHI. LEGAL F. 247, 251 (2010) (noting that the VTVPA \nwas amended in 2003 to add a private cause of action โthereby codifying a new class of private \nattorneys  general  and  representing  an  effort  to  extend  civil  rights  protections  to  trafficked \npersons.โ).  Second, if forced to disclose their immigration status in a lawsuit, victims may be \nreluctant to file suit because, if it is revealed that they are not in the country legally, they may \nface deportation or harassment.  Rivera, 364 F.3d at 1064.  One court even reasoned that \ndocumented  workers  might  be  deterred  from  enforcing  their  rights  for  โfear  that  their \nimmigration status would be changed, or that their status would reveal the immigration problems \nof their family or friends. . .โ  Id. at 1065.  Thus, the in terrorem effect reflects a policy choice \nthat the enforcement of certain statutes outweighs a partyโs need for full and unfettered discovery \ninto matters that may be of minimal or no relevance.  Rivera, 364 F.3d at 1064โ66 (discussing \nthe policy reasons behind the in terrorem doctrine and holding: โGiven Title VIIโs dependence \non  private  enforcement,  we  find  that  the  national  effort  to  eradicate  discrimination  in  the \nworkplace would be hampered by the discovery practices [the defendant] seeks to validate \nhere.โ); Topo v. Dhir, 210 F.R.D. 76, 78 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (โ[A]llowing parties to inquire about \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 148   Filed 10/15/14   Page 13 of 21 PageID #:  2731\n \nthe immigration status  of other parties, . . . present[s] a  danger of intimidation  [that] would \ninhibit plaintiffs in pursuing their rights.โ) (citation omitted). \nThere is no bright-line rule for when the in terrorem effect should limit discovery.  \nRather, courts balance the unique facts and posture of each case against the relevant social \npolicies  of  the  statutes  at  issue.   See,  e.g.,  Thomas  A.  Doyle,  โCompeting  Concerns  in \nEmployment Litigation: How Courts are Managing Discovery of an Employeeโs Immigration \nStatus,โ 28 A.B.A. J. LAB. & EMP. L. 405, 406โ14 (Spring 2013) (identifying eight factors courts \noften consider in deciding whether to allow discovery of an employeeโs immigration status).  \nThe two most relevant factors that courts tend to consider are: what statute the plaintiff is suing \nunder and the procedural posture of the case.  \nAs for the statute that a plaintiff is suing under, this informs whether immigration status \nis in any way relevant to the underlying case.  Where irrelevant or merely collateral to a partyโs \nclaim or defense, courts often preclude immigration related discovery.  See  Topo, 210 F.R.D. at \n77โ78.  For example, the Fifth Circuit granted a writ of mandamus and reversed a trial courtโs \norder requiring the plaintiffs to answer questions related to their immigration status, because the \nโprotections of the Fair Labor Standards Act are applicable to citizens and aliens alike and \nwhether the alien is documented or undocumented is irrelevant.โ  In re Reyes, 814 F.2d 168, \n170โ71 (5th Cir. 1987); see also EEOC v. Evans Fruit Co., Inc., CV-10-3033-LRS, 2012 WL \n442025  (E.D.  Wash.  Feb.  10,  2012)  (noting  that  immigration  status  has  no  bearing  on \ndetermining liability under Title VII).  Conversely, when immigration status is arguably relevant, \ncourts have allowed for discovery.  See Cazorla v. Koch Foods of Miss., L.L.C., No. 3:10-cv-\n135, 2014 WL 281979, at *2 (S.D. Miss. Jan. 24, 2014). \nThe heart of the issue in this case is human trafficking.  One could argue that, like claims \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 148   Filed 10/15/14   Page 14 of 21 PageID #:  2732\n \nunder Title VII or the FLSA, immigration status is irrelevant to claim for trafficking.  See In re \nReyes, 814 F.2d at 170โ71.  A person can bring a trafficking claim regardless of whether they \nare a citizen, legal immigrant, or undocumented worker.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. ยง 1590.  However, \nsomething sets a trafficking claim apart from one brought pursuant to Title VII or the FLSAโ\nthe T and U visa.  These visas create a safe harbor, allowing victims of trafficking and certain \nother crimes to stay in the United States legally while prosecuting their case.  No such equivalent \nvisa, amnesty, or safe harbor exists for a plaintiff bringing an FLSA or Title VII claim. \nThe availability of these visas impact the in terrorem analysis in two important respects.  \nFirst, they create an incentive for an undocumented worker to fabricate or exaggerate a claim of \nhuman trafficking.  See Cazorla, 2014 WL 281979, at *1 (noting that certain immigration \nbenefits were available to plaintiffs due to their allegations).  The undersigned is not insinuating \nthat this is the case here.  However, it appears that this is at least conceivable, and Signal should \nhave the opportunity to explore this possibility.  Second, they create a safe harbor for illegal \nimmigrants who were victims of trafficking.  One of the underpinnings of the in terrorem effect \nis that undocumented workers will be less likely to seek redress for fear that their immigration \nstatus will be revealed and they will then face deportation.  Because an undocumented worker \nwho was the victim of severe trafficking can receive a T or U visa, any chilling effect is greatly \nminimized.  In fact, it is difficult to imagine an undocumented worker who would bring a civil \nsuit alleging to be a victim of trafficking, but fail to seek such a visa.  Or, stated another way, it \nis difficult to comprehend an instance in which a person would not report that they were a victim \nof human trafficking for fear their T visa would be potentially discoverable in a lawsuit years \nlaterโa lawsuit they themselves initiated.  The only workers whose rights might be chilled \nwould be those who were trafficked but failed to qualify for either visa.  Empirical evidence, \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 148   Filed 10/15/14   Page 15 of 21 PageID #:  2733\n \nhowever, suggests that this is a relatively small group, and the Plaintiffs have not suggested that \ncould be the case here.7 \nThe procedural posture of a case also impacts the in terrorem analysis.  For example, in \nRivera, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the trial courtโs issuance of a protective order precluding \ndiscovery related to immigration status, because such discovery was irrelevant at that time to the \nissue before the court, which was liability (as opposed to damages) under Title VII.  Rivera, 364 \nF.3d at 1074โ75.  The trial court, however, had yet to decide whether the proceedings were going \nto be bifurcated, leaving the door open to the possibility that the analysis may change in the \nfuture.  See Rivera, 364 F.3d at 1062, 1070.  As one court subsequently noted, โRivera did not \nforeclose the possibility that immigration status, although clearly irrelevant to the Title VII \nliability determination, might not become relevant later in the remedies portion of the litigation.โ  \nRodriguez v. ACL Farms, Inc., No. cv-10-3010, 2010 WL 4683743, *4 (E.D. Wash. Nov. 12, \n2010).  Likewise, in David, one of the parallel cases pending in the Eastern District of Louisiana, \nwhen the court first entered the protective order (that the Plaintiffs argue the undersigned should \nadopt), the issue being resolved was class certification.  David, 257 F.R.D. at 125.  Immigration \nstatus of the plaintiffs had no bearing on the issues of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and \nadequacy of representation.  Id.   \nCourts, however, have recognized that as a case progresses and moves towards trial, the \npendulum begins to swing in favor of allowing discovery, and depending on the facts of the case, \n                                                 \n7.  From 2002 through 2012, 5,820 T-1 visa applications, which are visas issued directly to the victim, were \nfiled.  See U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Form I-914 โ Application for T Nonimmigrant Status, Form I-\n918 โ Petition for Nonimmigrant Status Receipts, Approvals, and Denials, Fiscal Year 2013, Through Third Quarter, \nhttp://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-studies/immigration-forms-data/data-set-form-i-914-application-t-nonimmigrant-\nstatus (last visited October 2, 2014).  Of those applied for, 1,671 were denied, equating to 29%.  As for T-2,3,4 or 5 \nvisas, which are available to family members of a victim, 606 applications, or 20%, were denied.  From 2009 \nthrough 2012, 18% of U-1 visa (victim visas) were denied, and 16% of U-2,3,4,5 (family member visas) were \ndenied.     \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 148   Filed 10/15/14   Page 16 of 21 PageID #:  2734\n \na defendantโs need may outweigh any social policies that would otherwise prevent disclosure.  \nSee Cazorla, 2014 WL 281979 at *1.  For example, in Cazorla, Koch Foods of Mississippi was \naccused of committing atrocities against Hispanic workers.  Id.  The court, early in the case, \nentered a protective order prohibiting discovery of immigration related documents.  Id.  Koch \nFoods  later  sought  reconsideration  of  the  protective  order  and  specifically  to  compel  the \nproduction of the plaintiffsโ U visas.  Id.  The court granted Kochโs motion as to the visas, noting \nthat they were relevant because โimmigration benefits may be made available to [the plaintiffs] \nbecause of the allegations they have made.โ  Id.  The court held: \nThe issue is the relevance of the information sought by Koch Foods to the claims \nand defenses in this action.  Koch Foods has raised a legitimate defense regarding \nU  visas,  T  visas,  or  other  immigration  benefits,  and  it  is  entitled  to  pursue \ndiscovery, including visa applications, that supports the defense.  The relevance of \nthis information clearly outweighs its in terrorem effect, as any individuals who \nhave applied for immigration benefits have, necessarily, already disclosed their \nimmigration status to federal authorities.  \n \nId. at *2.  Likewise, other courts, after balancing all the factors, have found that a defendantโs \nneed for information outweighed any potential in terrorem effect.  See Camayo v. John Peroulis \n& Sons Sheep, Inc., Nos. 10-cv-772, 11-cv-1132, 2012 WL 5931716, at *1โ2 (D. Colo. Nov. 27, \n2012) (granting a motion to compel production of the plaintiffsโ T or U visas in a human \ntrafficking case); EEOC v. Global Horizons, Inc., No. cv-11-3045, 2013 WL 3940674, at *4โ7 \n(E.D.  Wash  July  31,  2013)  (lifting  the  prohibition  on  discovery  related  to  the  plaintiffsโ \nimmigration status because the information was relevant, and the plaintiffs failed to show good \ncause warranting a continued limitation). \n  After  weighing  all  the  relevant  factors  and  policies,  the  undersigned  finds  that  the \nPlaintiffs have failed to meet  their burden of  showing that โgood causeโ exists to  enter a \nprotective order precluding production of the Plaintiffsโ visa related documents.  The Plaintiffs \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 148   Filed 10/15/14   Page 17 of 21 PageID #:  2735\n \nhave not demonstrated that there would in fact be a chilling effect if, at this stage, they were \nrequired to disclose their visas.  See In re Terra Intโl, Inc., 134 F.3d 302, 306 (5th Cir. 1998) \n(noting that a party must make โa particular and specific demonstration of fact as distinguished \nfrom stereotyped and conclusory statementsโ).  What the undersigned finds most compelling is \nthat, in this context, any chilling effect is largely offset by the availability of the T or U visa.  A \nvictim of trafficking does not need to choose between risking deportation by filing suit to rectify \na wrong, or allowing atrocities to go unpunished in order to avoid bringing attention to their \nimmigration status.  Instead, purported victims of human trafficking are allowed to blow the \nwhistle on their employers while at the same time being protected from deportation by obtaining \na T visa.  While there may be a small subset of people who are legitimate victims of trafficking \nbut denied a T visa, when balanced against the relevancy of this information and Signalโs need \nfor it, the undersigned finds protecting this small and undefined class is an insufficient reason to \ndeny Signal the information it seeks.   \nAccordingly, the undersigned grants Signalsโ motion as to the Plaintiffsโ T and U visas \nand any employment authorization documents issued in conjunction with these visas.   \niv.  Limits  on  further  discovery  and  on  the  use  and  dissemination  of  the \nPlaintiffsโ documents \n \nThe Plaintiffs seek to block Signal from obtaining personal information about them, as \nwell as their relatives.  (Doc. No. 137, p. 14.)  As discussed above, some discovery into the \nPlaintiffsโ  immigration  status  is  permissible.    Nevertheless,  discovery  aimed  at  sensitive \ninformation of people who are not parties to this case may very well have an in terrorem effect \non the Plaintiffs and deter them from prosecuting this suit.  Signal, however, has not made such a \nrequest,  as  no  Request  for  Production  is  aimed  at  documents  related  to  any  third  parties.  \nTherefore, at this time, there is no need to enter a broad protective order.  Should Signal seek \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 148   Filed 10/15/14   Page 18 of 21 PageID #:  2736\n \nsuch discovery, the undersigned will at that time weigh the potential in terrorem effect against \nSignalโs need for the information, which may alter the balance of the various factors.   \nIn addition, it is worth noting that discovery related to the immigration status of friends \nand relatives would appear to be irrelevant.  For example, a condition precedent of a family \nmember receiving a visa is that the victim be awarded a visa.  8 C.F.R. ยง 214.11(o) (โan alien \nwho has applied for and been granted T-1 nonimmigrant status may apply for admission of an \nimmediate  family  member  .  .  .  .โ).    Therefore,  production  of  the  named  Plaintiffsโ  visa \ninformation should be sufficient for Signal to test its theories regarding the Plaintiffsโ motives.  \nShould  Signal  seek  discovery  related  to  the  Plaintiffsโ  family  members,  it  will  need  to \ndemonstrate a particular need.  However, because it is theoretically possible that such a need \nmay exist, the undersigned will address that issue if and when it presents itself.  \nThe  Plaintiffs  shall  designate  any  documents  produced  pursuant  to  this  order  as \nโConfidentialโ and those documents are to be treated as โProtected Documents,โ as defined in \nthe protective order governing this case.  (Doc. Nos. 55 and 94.)  Moreover, the undersigned is \nmindful that to some extent this order conflicts with ones that have been entered in the cases \npending in the Eastern District of Louisiana.  Therefore, to prevent Signal from circumventing \nthe protective orders in other cases, Signal may only use information regarding the Plaintiffs \nvisas and immigration status produced pursuant to this order in this case; use outside this case, in \nany manner, including depositions, motions, etc., particularly in the EEOC case, which shares \ncommon plaintiffs, would be a violation of this order and would subject the violating party to \nsanctions.8  \n                                                 \n8.  This does not impact the โConsent Order Regarding Use of Discovery from Related Cases.โ  (Doc. No. \n96.)    Rather,  this  order  only  applies  to  sensitive  information,  particularly  information  about  the  Plaintiffsโ \nimmigration status.  While this standard may appear vague, the undersigned is confident that if the parties take a \ncommon sense approach, there should be no issues. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 148   Filed 10/15/14   Page 19 of 21 PageID #:  2737\n \nb.  Requests for production seeking general personal information \n  In addition to the immigration materials discussed above, Signal also seeks to compel \nproduction of the Plaintiffsโ โdriverโs licenses, passports with visa stamps, documents relating to \na plaintiffsโ involvement in or with social media, and writings relating to the plaintiffsโ first \npaycheck from a source other than Signal.โ  (Doc. No. 127, p. 1.)   \nAt the outset, Signal has objected to several requests for production propounded by the \nPlaintiffs on the grounds that:  \ndocuments requested for the time frame January 1, 2004 through July 31, 2005 \nand February 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009 are not relevant or likely to \nlead to the discovery of relevant information.  Signal objects to the date range in \nthis request because only events during the recruitment of the H2B workers and \ntheir time of employment at Signal.  Only that portion of the requested date is \nprobative of the claims in this case. \n \n(Doc. No. 137, Ex. 1, pp. 2, 4, 12) (emphasis added).  Signal cannot refuse to produce documents \non grounds that any documents from outside a certain period are irrelevant to the dispute, and \nthen seek to compel production of documents from this same timeframe.  As the Plaintiffs \ncorrectly note, โthe Signal Defendants cannot have it both ways.โ  (Id. at p. 10.)  Because Signal \nhas objected to any discovery after the Plaintiffs left Signal, and from the information before the \ncourt  there  is  no  indication  that  Signal  withdrew  these  objections  or  that  the  parties  have \nsubsequently agreed to expand the relevant period for discovery, the undersigned denies Signalโs \nmotion as to any of these documents that were created after the Plaintiffs left Signal. \n  Considering  this  limitation  as  to  the  relevant  period,  the  undersigned  will  examine \nwhether Signal has carried its burden, and in turn, whether the Plaintiffs have carried their \nburden for showing why these documents should not be produced.  As for Plaintiffsโ drivers \nlicenses, passports, and first post-Signal paycheck, Signalโs motion makes no mention of why \nthese documents are relevant  to  this dispute.  Signalโs motion  is  primarily focused on the \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 148   Filed 10/15/14   Page 20 of 21 PageID #:  2738\n \nimmigration related documents discussed above, and the main premise of its motion is that it \nneeds documents that may evidence motive.  These documents are not relevant to motive, in any \nway probative of motive, nor are they likely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  \nTherefore, Signal has failed to carry its burden, and its motion as to these requests is denied.  \nMoreover, โwritings relating to the plaintiffsโ first paycheck from a source other than Signalโ are \nby definition documents that were generated after the Plaintiffs left Signal.  As discussed above, \nSignal has declared any documents from this time irrelevant.  Therefore, Signal cannot now seek \nto compel these documents. \n  As for Signalโs request for documents relating to a plaintiffsโ โinvolvement in or with \nsocial media,โ these documents could conceivably contain information related to the issues in \nthis case.  For example, it is possible that the Plaintiffsโ social media pages contain information \nprobative  of  the  Plaintiffsโ  living  and  working  conditions  while  employed  by  Signal,  their \nexperiences of being trafficked, or even discussions about suing Signal.  Therefore, Signal has \nmet its minimal burden of showing that this information is discoverable.  The Plaintiffsโ primary \nreason for resisting production of these documents is the potential in terrorem effect it would \nhave.  For reasons discussed above, the undersigned does not find that the in terrorem effect is a \nsufficient reason to deny Signal access to these documents, therefore, the Plaintiffs fail to meet \ntheir burden of showing why they should not be compelled to produce these documents.   \n  Accordingly, Signalโs motion is granted in part and denied in part as to the Plaintiffsโ \nFacebook pages.  The Plaintiffs shall produce documents responsive to this Request.  However, \nthe Plaintiffs are only required to produce documents dating from the time they were being \nrecruited, and the time that they were employed by Signal.  Because Signal, in its own responses \nto discovery, has limited the relevant period for discovery, the Plaintiffsโ current Facebook \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 148   Filed 10/15/14   Page 21 of 21 PageID #:  2739\n \nprofiles are irrelevant.  Moreover, to the extent that the Plaintiffs communicated with their \nlawyers via Facebook, or its messenger program, while employed by Signal, these are privileged.  \nPlaintiffs shall indicate whether such communications exist, and if they do and the Plaintiffs \nwithhold them, the Plaintiffs shall produce a privilege log. \nV. Conclusion \n  It  is  therefore  ORDERED  that  Signalโs  โMotion  to  Compelโ  (Doc.  No.  127)  is \nGRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.  Within seven (7) days, the Plaintiffs shall \nproduce documents responsive to Signalโs Requests for Production Nos. 5, 6, 7, and 8, including \ninformation related to U visas.  Signal shall also produce documents responsive the Requests for \nProduction Nos. 12 and 13, but must only produce documents created during the recruitment \nprocess or while the Plaintiffs were employed by Signal.  Should any of the documents be \nwithheld  as  attorney-client  communications,  the  Plaintiffs  shall  produce  a  privilege  log \nsufficiently  detailed  so  Signal  may  assess  whether  the  communication  is  truly  privileged.  \nSignalโs motion as to Requests for Production Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 47 is denied.  Furthermore, the \nPlaintiffsโ request for the entry of a protective order (Doc. No. 137) is DENIED. \n  Lastly, Signal is precluded from using information produced pursuant to this order in any \nother matter pending in either the Eastern District of Texas or Eastern District of Louisiana. \nSIGNED this 15th day of October, 2014.\n__________________________________________________\nZaacckk HHaawwtthhoorrnn\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n21 \n ",

(Doc. No. 153.)  \nDefendants Sachin Dewan and Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd. (collectively, โDewanโ) moved to \nexclude Signalโs expert, Dr. Louise Shelley.  (Doc. No. 159.)  Because the motions all relate to \nthe same operative facts, apply the same law, and at times relate to one another, the undersigned \nwill address all the pending motions in one order. \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 2 of 38 PageID #:  7656\n \nI.  BACKGROUND \n \nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, approximately 590 men, including the seventeen \nPlaintiffs in this case, were allegedly trafficked into the United States to provide labor for \nSignalโs operations.  (Doc. No. 64, pp. 2โ4.)  The Plaintiffs claim that the Defendants made false \npromises  of  โpermanent  work-based  immigration  to  the  United  States,โ  and  that  to  take \nadvantage of this promising opportunity, the Plaintiffs allegedly โplunged themselves and their \nfamilies into debt . . . to pay mandatory recruitment, immigration processing, and travel fees . . \n. .โ  (Id. at p. 2.)  After arriving at Signalโs facility in Orange, Texas, the Plaintiffs were allegedly \nsubjected  to  serious  abuses,  threatened  with  deportation  if  they  left,  and  forced  to  live  in \nsubstandard conditions.  In addition, the Plaintiffs assert that they could not leave their jobs with \nSignal due to the large debts they incurred in their homeland.  Signal denies any wrongdoing and \ndenies that the Plaintiffs were subjected to forced labor, trafficking, or involuntary servitude.   \nA putative class action was filed in the Eastern District of Louisiana on behalf of all the \nworkers who had allegedly been trafficked to the United States to work at Signalโs facilities in \nTexas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.  (See Doc. 1, David v. Signal Intโl, L.L.C., 2:08-cv-1220 \n(March 7, 2008)).  The court in David denied class certification, which caused the individual \nclass members to file suit where their alleged injuries occurred.  See David v. Signal Intโl, \nL.L.C., No 08-1220, 2012 WL 10759668, at *37 (E.D. La. Jan. 4, 2012).  The Plaintiffs in this \ncase worked at Signalโs facility in Orange, Texas, which is within this judicial district.  \nThe Plaintiffs allege that some or all of the Defendants violated the following federal \nstatutes: (1) the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003; (2) the Racketeer \nInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act; (3) the Civil Rights Act of 1866; and (4) the Ku Klux \nKlan Act of 1871.  (Doc. No. 64, pp. 50โ68.)  In addition, the Plaintiffs assert causes of action \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 3 of 38 PageID #:  7657\nfor  state  law  fraud,  negligent  misrepresentation,  and  breach  of  contract  against  all  of  the \nDefendants.  (Id.)  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \n \nThe admission or exclusion of expert testimony is a matter within the discretion of the \ndistrict court.  Kuhmo Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 152 (1999); Huss v. Gayden, 571 \nF.3d 442, 452 (5th Cir. 2009).  Federal Rule of Evidence 702 provides: \nIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact \nto understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as \nan expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify \nthereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon \nsufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and \nmethods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to \nthe facts of the case. \n \nFED. R. EVID. 702; accord Kuhmo Tire Co., 526 U.S. at 152; Daubert v. Merrel Dow Pharms., \nInc., 509 U.S. 579, 588 (1993).  The proponent of the proffered expert testimony โhas the burden \nof establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the pertinent admissibility requirements \nare met.โ  United States v. Fullwood, 342 F.3d 409, 412 (5th Cir. 2003) (citing FED. R. EVID. \n104(a)).      \nThe  district  court  is  to  consider  several  criteria  in  determining  whether  an  expertโs \nopinion is admissible.  First, whether the proffered expert is qualified to testify because of his \nknowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.  United States v. Cooks, 589 F.3d 173, 179 \n(5th Cir. 2009) (citing FED. R. EVID. 702); Wilson v. Woods, 163 F.3d 935, 937 (5th Cir. 1999).  \nโ[T]o qualify as an expert, โthe witness must have such knowledge or experience in [his] field or \ncalling as to make it appear that his opinion or inference will probably aid the trier in his search \nfor truth.โโ  United States v. Hicks, 389 F.3d 514, 524 (5th Cir. 2004) (quoting United States v. \nBourgeois, 950 F.2d 980, 987 (5th Cir. 1992)) (internal quotations omitted).   \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 4 of 38 PageID #:  7658\n  Next, whether the proffered expertโs testimony is reliable.  See Kuhmo Tire Co., 526 U.S. \nat  152.    The  court  possesses  considerable  flexibility  in  assessing  the  reliability  of  expert \ntestimony.  Id. at 141; Stolt Achievement, Ltd. v. Dredge B. E. Lindholm, 447 F.3d 360, 366 (5th \nCir. 2006).  While the Daubert factors are the most common benchmark, the court should \nconsider all relevant factors, and is not required to analyze the Daubert factors in every case.  \nStolt Achievement, Ltd, 447 F.3d at 366 (citing Kuhmo Tire Co., 526 U.S. at 149).  The \noverarching goal โis to make certain that an expert . . . employs in the courtroom the same level \nof intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.โ  Kuhmo \nTire Co., 526 U.S. at 152.   \n  โThe [c]ourtโs role is that of a gatekeeper only, limited to determining admissibility, not \ncredibility of the evidence.โ  Knox v. Ferrer, No. 5:07-CV-6, 2008 WL 4411326, at *2 (S.D. \nMiss. Sept. 22, 2008) (citing Pipitone v. Biomatrix, Inc., 288 F.3d 239, 244 (5th Cir. 2002)).  \nThis  role requires a  court  to  make โa preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or \nmethodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or \nmethodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.โ  Daubert, 509 U.S. at 592โ93.  The \ncourt should approach this task โwith proper deference to the juryโs role as the arbiter of disputes \nbetween conflicting opinions.โ United States v. 14.38 Acres of Land, 80 F.3d 1074, 1077 (5th \nCir. 1996) (quoting Viterbo v. Dow Chem Co., 826 F.2d 420, 422 (5th Cir. 1987)) (internal \nquotations omitted).  \n  The courtโs assessment of admissibility is not intended to replace the adversarial system, \nwhich should highlight weak evidence.  Primrose Operating Co. v. Natโl Am. Ins. Co., 382 F.3d \n546, 562 (5th Cir. 2004).  โVigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and \ncareful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 5 of 38 PageID #:  7659\nshaky but admissible evidence.โ  Daubert, 509 U.S. at 596.  โThe Daubert analysis should not \nsupplant trial on the merits.โ  Mathis v. Exxon Corp., 302 F.3d 448, 461 (5th Cir. 2002) (citing \nPipitone, 288 F.3d at 250).      \n  Finally, the court must determine that the proffered expert testimony is relevant.  See \nFED. R. EVID. 702 (stating that expert testimony is admissible only if it โwill assist the trier of \nfact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issueโ).  Evidence is relevant if it โhas \nany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the \naction more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.โ  FED. R. EVID. \n401.     \nIII. ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Plaintiffsโ โMotion to Exclude Ron J. McAlear as Expertโ (Doc. No. 150) \n \nSignal  retained  Ronald  J.  McAlear  (โMcAlearโ)  โfor  the  purposes  of  providing \ninformation and guidance on Shipyard normal and customary practices . . . .โ  (Doc. No. 150, Ex. \nC, p. 1.)  McAlear is an engineer, holds a masterโs degree from the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology, and has spent his career working in all facets of the shipbuilding industry, including \nat the management level.  (Id. at pp. 1โ2.)  Though difficult to discern precisely what McAlearโs \nopinions are, it appears that he concludes that Signal โapplies the normal and customary industry \npracticesโ in several areas, including: safety, quality, the environment, the use of I.D. badges, \nand the issuance of personal protective equipment.  (Id. at pp. 28โ29.)   \nThe Plaintiffs seek to exclude McAlear as an expert on the grounds that: (1) he is not \nqualified to testify as an expert on safety; (2) his opinions are irrelevant; (3) his opinions are not \nbased on sufficient or reliable facts or data; and (4) his methodology is flawed.  (Doc. No. 150, \npp. 11โ14.)  In addition, should the undersigned not completely exclude McAlear, the Plaintiffs \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 6 of 38 PageID #:  7660\nseek to limit his opinions to those contained in the report that was served on July 29, 2014โthe \nโTexas Reportโโarguing that a later served report was untimely.  (Id. at pp. 10โ11.)  \na.  Timeliness of the David Report \n  As an initial matter, the Plaintiffs seek to limit McAlearโs opinions to those contained in \nthe Texas Report.  (Id.)  The Plaintiffs argue that McAlear drafted a more robust report for use in \na parallel caseโthe โDavid Reportโโafter โrecognizing that the Texas Report was woefully \ninadequate.โ  (Id. at p. 4.)  While the Texas Report was timely, the David Report was served in \nthis case on August 27, 2014, weeks after the deadline for disclosing experts passed.  (See Doc. \nNo. 122) (setting July 29, 2014 as the deadline for defendants to serve expert reports).   \n  โRule 26(a) requires the expertโs initial report to include โa complete statement of all \nopinions the witness will express and the basis and reasons for them.โโ  Culter v. Louisville \nLadder, Inc., No. 4:10-4684, 2012 WL 2994271, at *5 (S.D. Tex. July 20, 2012) (quoting FED. R. \nCIV. P. 26(a)(2)(B)(i)) (emphasis in original).  In addition, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nimpose a duty to supplement expert reports.  See FED. R. CIV. P. 26(a)(2)(E); 26(e).  Courts, \nhowever, have struck so-called โsupplementalโ reports when they were offered not because of \nnewly learned information or to correct an error in the initial report, as is contemplated by the \nRules, but  rather were  merely  an attempt to  bolster the original  report.  Culter, 2012 WL \n2994271 at *5; see also Gallagher v. S. Source Packaging, L.L.C., 568 F. Supp. 2d 624, 631 \n(E.D.N.C. 2008) (โCourts distinguish โtrue supplementationโ (e.g. correcting inadvertent errors \nor omissions) from gamesmanship, and have therefore repeatedly rejected attempts to avert \nsummary judgment by โsupplementingโ an expert report with a โnew and improvedโ expert \nreport.โ).  Such a decision lies within the discretion of the court.  See Reliance Ins. Co. v. La. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 7 of 38 PageID #:  7661\nLand & Exploration Co., 110 F.3d 253, 257โ58 (5th Cir. 1997) (finding that the district court did \nnot abuse its discretion in refusing to allow a late filed supplemental report). \n  Here, the David Report cannot fairly be classified as merely a supplement to the Texas \nReport.  Signal points to no newly learned information or errors that McAlear sought to correct.  \nRather, Signal asserts that the David Report provides โgreater explanation and support for Mr. \nMcAlearโs conclusionsโโthis is the antithesis of a supplemental report.  (Doc. No. 173, p. 9.)  \nThe Plaintiffs, however, fail to identify how they have been prejudiced.  See Geiserman v. \nMacDonald, 893 F.2d 787, 791 (5th Cir. 1990) (affirming the district courtโs enforcement of a \nscheduling order that resulted in a party not being able to present expert testimony, and noting \nthat one of the factors was the โpotential prejudice in allowingโ the late testimony).  The David \nReport was served well in advance of McAlearโs deposition, and the Plaintiffs do not assert that \ntheir preparation was hindered.  Furthermore, the Plaintiffs have not claimed that the late report \nrequired them to retain a new expert, or that it was merely offered as an attempt to avoid \nsummary judgment.  See Reliance Ins. Co., 110 F.3d at 257 (noting that if a late supplemental \nreport were allowed, the defendants could potentially be required to seek a rebuttal witness and a \ndelay would have been inevitable); Culter, 2012 WL 2994271 at *5.  \nThe  undersigned  does  not  condone  the  serving  of  a  late  expert  reportโparticularly \nwithout seeking leave to do so.  However, given the logistical complexities of having multiple \ncases proceeding at the same time in two districts, and the fact that the Plaintiffs were unable to \nshow any prejudice, the David Report will be considered as the operative expert report for this \ncase.    \n \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 8 of 38 PageID #:  7662\nb.  Scope of McAlearโs opinions \nBefore discussing the Plaintiffsโ specific arguments, it necessary to clarify the scope \nMcAlearโs opinions.  The Plaintiffs characterize McAlear as โan expert on safety practices,โ and \nmost of their arguments are aimed at excluding McAlear as a safety expert.  (Doc. No. 150, pp. \n11โ12.)  Signal concedes that he is not an expert on safety, and asserts that he is merely opining \nabout whether โa company operates customarily in the industry relative to safety.โ  (Doc. No. \n173, pp. 5โ6.)   Signal  also  identifies  other  general  areas, aside from safety practices,  that \nMcAlear discusses.  (Id. at p. 2โ3.)   \nMcAlear, however, at times opines that Signalโs facilities were in fact safe.  For example, \nhe states, โSignal has operated one of the safest shipyards in the Industryโ and that Signalโs \nโsafety record is evident when you compare the historical safety performance ratings from 2003 \nto 2013.โ  (Doc. No. 150, Ex. C, p. 25.)  McAlear goes so far as to call Signalโs safety record \nโexemplary.โ  (Id.)  Such opinions go beyond merely  discussing what is customary in the \nindustry.   \nThe  undersigned  finds  that  McAlearโs  opinions  on  safety  are  inadmissible  for  two \nreasons.  First, McAlear admits that he is โnot an expert in safety.โ  (Doc. No. 150, Ex. B, \n131:12.)  Therefore, he is not qualified to render such opinions.  Second, he has not examined \nsufficient information nor applied a reliable or meaningful principle to reach these particular \nconclusions.  Rendering an opinion that Signalโs safety record is โexemplaryโ would require \nconsidering and balancing Signalโs safety record against that of other companies or against \nidentifiable industry standards.  McAlear undertook no such analysis.  Conversely, to opine \ngenerally that Signalโs practices are consistent with industry customs only requires being familiar \nwith the industry and being familiar with Signalโs practices.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 9 of 38 PageID #:  7663\n  Accordingly, McAlearโs opinions are limited to those relating to customary practices \nwithin the marine fabrication industry, and he may not opine as to whether Signalโs facilities \nwere in fact safe. \nc.  McAlear is qualified to testify about industry customs \nThe Plaintiffs argue that McAlearโs report should be excluded because he admitted that \nhe is not an expert on safety, and therefore, not qualified to testify as an expert.  (Doc. No. 150, \np. 12.)  However, as discussed above, the Plaintiffsโ characterization of McAlearโs opinions is \ntoo narrow.  He is not just opining on whether Signal is a safe company or about its safety \nrecord.  Rather, he discusses general industry customs and Signalโs practices measured against \nthose customs.  Given McAlearโs โ[o]ver 40 years of experience in all aspects of the Marine \nIndustry,โ  including  experience  in  managing  and  running  shipyards,  his  practical  work \nexperience qualifies him as an expert about general practices in the industry.  (Doc. No. 150, Ex. \nC, App. A); see also Martin v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., No. 2:10-cv-268, 201l WL 6399690, at  *1 \n(S.D. Miss. Dec. 20, 2011) (finding that an expertโs twenty-four  years of work experience \nqualified him to testify as an expert); Satcher v. Honda Motor Co., 52 F.3d 1311, 1317โ18 (5th \nCir. 1995) (holding that the district court did not err in finding an expert qualified to testify based \non his experience). \nd.  McAlearโs opinions are relevant \nThe Plaintiffs claim that McAlearโs report should be struck because โ[g]eneral standards \nand practices in the industry and Signalโs shipyard safety practices are not relevant toโ any of \ntheir claims.  (Doc. No. 150, p. 11.)  In response, Signal asserts that due to the Plaintiffsโ factual \nallegations about the use of I.D. badges and unsafe working conditions, McAlearโs opinions \nabout general industry practices are relevant.  (Doc. No. 173, pp. 2โ5.)  Signal is correctโthe \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 10 of 38 PageID #:  7664\nPlaintiffsโ complaint makes numerous references to the conditions of employment imposed by \nSignal.  For example, the Plaintiffsโ complaint discusses the testing and re-testing by Signal, the \nfact that Signal charged the Plaintiffs for job-related tool kits, the use of I.D. badges, and general \nworking conditions.  (See Doc. No. 64, pp. 38โ50.)  \nExpert  testimony  is  admissible  if  it  will  โhelp  the  trier  of  fact  to  understand  the \nevidence . . . .โ    See   F ED.  R.  CIV.  702.   To  the  extent  that  the  Plaintiffs  criticize  certain \nconditions of their employment and complain that they were working in substandard conditions, \nexpert testimony claiming that these are customary practices is relevant.  Moreover, a potential \njuror is unlikely to be familiar with customary shipyard practices, and as such, expert testimony \nwill assist the jury on this topic.  The Plaintiffs, however, claim that the issue is not whether \nSignal operates its facility in a way that is consistent with industry customs, but rather, whether \nthe Plaintiffs were treated differently than other similarly situated non-Indian workers employed \nby Signal.  (Doc. No. 189, p. 2) (โ[T]he practices of the industry at large, with respect to all \nemployees, are irrelevant to the issue of Signalโs treatment of the Plaintiffs relative to other \nSignal employees.โ).  While the disparate treatment of the Plaintiffs may be the ultimate issue as \nto the Plaintiffsโ ยง 1981 claim, to the extent that the Plaintiffs raise certain issues about Signalโs \npractices, it would be helpful to a jury (albeit marginally) to learn about general practices in the \nindustry.  Accordingly, while McAlearโs testimony may not be a perfect fit to the ultimate issue \nin this case, it is relevant enough to be admissible.  See U.S. v. Tucker, 345 F.3d 320, 327 (5th \nCir. 2003) (noting that the relevance inquiry centers on โwhether expert testimony proffered in \nthe case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it will aid the jury in resolving a factual \ndisputeโ) (quoting Daubert, 509 U.S. at 591).  \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 11 of 38 PageID #:  7665\ne.  McAlearโs opinions are based sufficient facts and data \nNext, the Plaintiffs contend that McAlearโs report should be struck because he based his \nopinions on documents found on Signalโs website.  (Doc. No. 150, p. 12โ13.)  Stated another \nway, McAlear did not consider a sufficient amount of information from a reliable source.  This \ntype of challenge goes to the weight of his testimony, not its admissibility.  See 14.38 Acres of \nLand, 80 F.3d at 1077 (โAs a general rule, questions relating to the bases and sources of an \nexpertโs opinion affect the weight to be assigned that opinion rather than its admissibility and \nshould be left for the juryโs consideration.โ).  Moreover, a review of Appendix B to the David \nReport  illustrates  that  McAlear  reviewed  materials  beyond  just  those  available  on  Signalโs \nwebsite.  (Doc. No. 150, Ex. C, App. B.)  In fact, in their argument about all the differences \nbetween the Texas Report and the David Report, the Plaintiffs highlight all the information that \nMcAlear  considered.    (Doc.  No.  150,  pp.  4โ6)  (noting  that  McAlear  considered  ISO \ncertifications,  deposition  excerpts,  and  even  conducted  an  โinformal  surveyโ  on  tools  and \nprotective  gear).    Accordingly,  the  undersigned  finds  that  McAlear  has  reviewed  enough \ninformation to opine on whether Signalโs practices meet industry norms.  To the extent that the \nPlaintiffs  wish  to  challenge  the  bases  for  McAlearโs  opinions,  they  can  do  so  on  cross-\nexamination. \nf.  McAlearโs opinions are the product of reliable principles and/or methods \nThe Plaintiffs state that McAlear has met none of the Daubert factors.  (Doc. No. 150, pp. \n13โ14.)  The relevant inquiry, however, is not whether any or all of the Daubert factors are met, \nbut rather, whether there is any reasonable criteria on which the expert based his opinion.  See \nStolt Achievement, Ltd., 447 F.3d at 366; see also Huck v. City of Beaumont, 147 F. Supp. 2d \n565, 568 (E.D. Tex. 2001) (Cobb, J.) (โ[T]he Daubert inquiry is always fact-specific, and . . . the \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 12 of 38 PageID #:  7666\nDaubert factors may not all apply.โ).  Here, McAlear balanced his expertise about industry \ncustoms against sufficient information about Signalโs practices to reach the conclusion that \nSignalโs practices as to quality, the environment, the use of I.D. badges, and the issuance of \npersonal protective equipment are โnormal and customaryโ within the industry.  (Doc. No. 150, \nEx. C, p. 28.)  This type of analysis is sufficient to support McAlearโs opinions.   \ng.  Conclusion \n  For  the  reasons  stated  above,  the  undersigned  GRANTS  IN  PART  the  Plaintiffsโ \nโMotion to Exclude Ron J. McAlear as Expertโ (Doc. No. 150).  McAlear may testify about \ngeneral industry practices and opine on whether Signalโs practices are consistent with these \ncustoms.  McAlear, however, may not opine that Signal is a safe company or has an โexemplary \nsafety record.โ \nB.  Plaintiffsโ โMotion to Exclude Virginia Miles as Expertโ (Doc. No. 151) \nVirginia Miles (โMilesโ) is Signalโs expert on OSHA.  She offers one opinionโthat \nโprior  to  the  2009  Field  Operations  Manual  there  is  no  documentation  wherein  OSHA \ndefinitively  claimed  to  have  jurisdiction  over  non-agricultural  temporary  labor  camps . . . .โ  \n(Doc. No. 151, Ex. A, p. 2.)  Miles then supports this conclusion with five findings.  (Id.)  \n  The Plaintiffs move to strike Milesโs report, arguing that: (1) it is not relevant; (2) not \nhelpful; and (3) is merely a legal conclusion.  (See Doc. No. 151.)   \na.  Milesโs opinion on whether certain OSHA regulations applied is relevant \n  Plaintiffs argue, โthe jurisdiction and coverage of OSHA prior to 2009 is not relevant to \nthe legal claims at issue in this case.โ  (Id. at p. 2.)  As a preliminary matter, this is not an OSHA \nenforcement action, and therefore, OSHA standards play no substantive role in this case.  It is \ndisingenuous, however, for the Plaintiffs to make a relevance argument in light of the fact that \nthey designated an expert to offer opinions on the numerous ways in which Signal violated \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 13 of 38 PageID #:  7667\nOSHA regulations.  (Doc. No. 174, Ex. A) (detailing the various ways in which Signalโs โman \ncampโ  did  not  comply  with  OSHA).    Moreover,  the  Plaintiffsโ  expert  specifically  states, \nโOSHAโs Temporary Labor Camp standards apply to Signalโs housing camp at Orange, Texas.โ  \n(Id., Ex. A, p. 6.)  He then uses these regulations as a guide for detailing the numerous ways in \nwhich Signal  failed to  comply with  OSHA.   (Id.); (see  also Doc.  No. 190) (the Plaintiffs \ncharacterized their expert as opining โthat in his view the relevant OSHA regulations, 29 C.F.R. \nยง 1910.142, did apply to non-agricultural temporary labor camps, in 2006 and 2007,โ and that he \nโpresent[ed] an extensive analysis showing how far out of OSHA compliance the Texas โman \ncampโ was . . . .โ).  If the Plaintiffs are going to elicit testimony from an expert that Signal failed \nto  comply  with  certain  OSHA  regulations,  then  Milesโs  opinion,  which  merely  offers  a \nconflicting view on whether these regulations applied, is relevant.   \nb.  Milesโs opinion on whether certain OSHA regulations applied is helpful \n  Next, the Plaintiffs claim that Milesโs testimony will not be helpful because there is \nโnothing beyond the ken of the average juror.โ  (Doc. No. 151, p. 3.)  The undersigned disagrees.  \nA contested point between the parties (and their experts) is whether certain OSHA standards \napplied during the time in question, and whether these standards are the appropriate baseline \nupon which to  measure Signalโs  conduct.   A layperson will be assisted by  hearing expert \ntestimony on whether and to what extent these regulations appliedโif at allโduring the relevant \ntime. \nc.  Miles does not offer legal a conclusion \nLastly, the Plaintiffs seek to strike Milesโs report because it consists of impermissible \nlegal conclusions.  (Id.)  Miles, however, stops short of reaching a legal conclusion that the โman \ncampsโ were not subject to OSHAโs regulations on temporary labor camps.  Rather, her opinion \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 14 of 38 PageID #:  7668\nis that there is nothing clearly showing that these regulations applied.  (See Doc. No. 151, Ex. A, \np. 2) (claiming that there is โno documentation wherein OSHA definitively claimed to have \njurisdiction . . .โ).  It appears that Signal is going to use Miles to demonstrate that the standards \napplied by the Plaintiffsโ expert may not have applied, and thus, discredit his opinions.  Milesโs \nopinion is akin to merely rebutting a key assumption made by the Plaintiffsโ expert.  Incidentally, \nthe  Plaintiffsโ  expert  comes  much  closer  to  offering  a  legal  opinion,  by  stating:  โOSHAโs \nTemporary Labor Camp standards apply to Signalโs housing camp at Orange, Texas.โ  (Doc. No. \n174, Ex. A, p. 6.)   \nd.  Conclusion \nFor  the  reasons  stated  above,  the  Plaintiffsโ  โMotion  to  Exclude  Virginia  Miles  as \nExpertโ (Doc. No. 151) is DENIED. \nC.  The Plaintiffsโ โMotion to Exclude Donald H. Strobel as Expertโ (Doc. No. 154) \nSignal designated Donald H. Strobel as an expert on the Fair Labor Standards Act.  (Doc. \nNo. 177, p. 1.)  However, there are no FLSA claims pending in this case.  โExpert testimony \nwhich does not relate to any issue in the case is not relevant, and ergo, not helpful.โ  Roman v. \nWestern Mfg., 691 F.3d 686, 694 (5th Cir. 2012).  Because Strobleโs report is not helpful, it is \ninadmissible.  FED. R. EVID. 702.   \nAccordingly, the undersigned GRANTS Plaintiffsโ โMotion to Exclude Donald H. Strobel \nas Expert.โ  (Doc. No. 154.)  Signal, however, can seek reconsideration of this order should \nFLSA claims ever be added to this case. \nD.  The Plaintiffsโ โMotion to Exclude Kevin Fox Gotham as Expertโ (Doc. No. 152) \nSignal designated Kevin Fox Gotham, Ph.D. (โDr. Gothamโ), a professor of sociology at \nTulane University, to โevaluate the availability of housing in the Gulf Coast region in . . . Orange \nCounty[,] Texas in the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita.โ  (Doc. No. 178, p. 2.)  He \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 15 of 38 PageID #:  7669\noffers six opinions, labeled A through F, touching on the lack of available housing in the \naftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the impacts that this had on businesses to recruit \nworkers, and why Signal built the โman camps.โ  (Doc. No. 152, Ex. A.) \n  The Plaintiffs claim that Dr. Gothamโs report should be struck because it is (1) irrelevant \nand (2) based on insufficient facts and data.  The Plaintiffs also argue that Dr. Gothamโs report \nshould be limited to the four opinions that were contained in the report that was served in this \ncase, as opposed to the six opinions served in David (a parallel case pending in the Eastern \nDistrict of Louisiana).  \na.  Dr. Gothamโs last two opinions should not be struck for failing to serve them1 \nThe report attached to the Plaintiffsโ motion contains six opinions and appears to be from \nDavid.  (Doc. No. 152, Ex. A.)  Though not attached to any of the paritiesโ briefing, the Plaintiffs \nclaim that the report that was actually served in this case contained only four opinions.  (Doc. \nNo. 152, p. 4 n. 3.)  The Plaintiffs argue that the two additional opinions that Dr. Gotham offered \nin David should be excluded because they were never formally served in this case.  (Doc. No. \n194, p. 3 n. 3.)   \nThe undersigned disagrees for two reasons.  First, the Plaintiffs did not specifically move \nin their motion to have Dr. Gothamโs report limited to four opinions.  They merely asserted in a \nfootnote that Dr. Gothamโs report only contains four opinions, yet attached the report from \nDavid, which contains six opinions.  (See Doc. No. 152, p. 4 n. 3) (noting the difference between \nthe report served in this case and that served in David, but not requesting to have the additional \n                                                           \n1.  The decision whether to allow a late filed expert reportโwhich is essentially why the Plaintiffs seek to \nlimit Dr. Gothamโs opinionsโinvolves determining whether to amend the scheduling order.  This inquiry involves a \nfour-factor test.  See Geiserman, 893 F.2d at 790โ91.  In contrast, determining whether Dr. Gothamโs opinions are \nadmissible, is a different inquiry.  Therefore, the undersigned finds it necessary to first consider whether these \nopinions are properly part of this case, before determining whether they are admissible.  As will be discussed below, \nopinions E and F are struck from this case.   \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 16 of 38 PageID #:  7670\ntwo opinions struck).  It is not until the Plaintiffsโ reply is it clear that they seek such relief.  \n(Doc. No. 194, p. 3 n. 3) (discussing the two additional opinions in David, and arguing that \nโ[b]ecause these opinions were not provided in the Reportโwhich will not be amendedโsuch \nopinions should be excludedโ) (internal citations omitted).  The undersigned will not consider \narguments raised for the first time in a reply.  See Tran Enters., L.L.C. v. DHL Express (USA) \nInc., 627 F.3d 1004, 1010 (5th Cir. 2010).   \nSecond, even assuming the issue was properly raised, the Plaintiffs have not stated how \nthey were prejudiced by the additional two opinions.  Reliance Ins. Co., 110 F.3d at 257โ58 \n(applying the four factor test articulated in Geiserman).  The Plaintiffs had the opportunity to \ndepose Dr. Gotham regarding all six opinions, it appears that they had his full report in advance \nof his deposition, and there is nothing in the record demonstrating that the Plaintiffsโ deposition \npreparation as to all six opinions was hindered.  Moreover, while Dr. Gotham testified that he \ndoes not plan to amend his report, his deposition testimony is clear that he plans to offer six \nopinions in this case.  (Doc. No. 152, Ex. B, 156:6โ159:4.)  Therefore, there is no unfair surprise.   \nAgain, the undersigned does not condone Signalโs tactics of untimely bolstering an expert \nreport,  but  the  Plaintiffs  have  failed  to  properly  raise  this  issue  and  show  any  prejudice.  \nTherefore, to the extent that the Plaintiffs seek to exclude Dr. Gothamโs last two opinions \nbecause they were untimely (or never formally served)โtheir request is denied.    \nb.  Dr. Gothamโs opinions are relevant2 \nThe Plaintiffs argue that Dr. Gothamโs report, โwhich conclude[s] that Hurricanes Rita \nand Katrina destroyed housing and other buildings on the Gulf Coast,โ is โso generalized as to be \n                                                           \n2.  The Plaintiffs moved to exclude Dr. Gothamโs report in its entirety, but did not move in the alternative \nto strike opinion B, which addresses the impacts that Hurricane Katrina had on Mississippi.  Moreover, interspersed \nwith Dr. Gothamโs other opinions is a discussion of the Mississippi area, which was the location of another Signal \nfacility.  The undersigned questions whether a discussion of the Mississippi region is relevant to this case.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 17 of 38 PageID #:  7671\ncommon senseโ and therefore, fails to meet the helpfulness standard of Federal Rule of Evidence \n702(a).  (Doc. No. 152, p. 3.)  In addition, the Plaintiffs claim that โthe destruction caused by \nHurricane Katrina and Rita in 2005 is entirely irrelevant to the specific issue of what particular \nhousing was available to the Plaintiffs . . . .โ  (Id. at p. 7.)  Signal responds by arguing that Dr. \nGothamโs report is helpful because it โwill assist the Court and the jury in determining the nexus \nbetween Signalโs logic, intentions, and actions.โ  (Doc. No 178, p. 5.) \nTo  meet  the  first  prong  of  Rule  702,  โthe  expertโs  scientific,  technical,  or  other \nspecialized knowledge [must] help the trier of fact understand the evidence or to determine a fact \nin issue.โ  FED. R. CIV. P. 702(a).  The Plaintiffs claim that there is no need for expert testimony \non the fact that hurricanes Rita and Katrina destroyed housing on the Gulf Coast.  Dr. Gothamโs \nopinions, however, go beyond this one basic idea.  For example, he also opines on the โproblems \nthat businesses faced in attracting skilled labor in the context of widespread housing damage in \nthe months and years after Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita.โ  (Doc. No. 178, p. 5); (see \nalso Doc. No. 152, Ex. A, pp. 23โ27) (discussing the correlation between the lack of available \nhousing and the difficulty in attracting workers).  Moreover, the extent of the housing shortage \nmay be beyond the knowledge of a layperson.  While some jurors may still remember what life \nwas like after the hurricanes, it is plausible that a juror may have only recently moved to the area \nand lacks such familiarity.  In addition, these hurricanes occurred nearly ten years agoโit is \npossible that memories have faded.  Accordingly, information regarding the housing market and \nthe impact that it had on attracting workers to the area is helpful, and as such, meets Rule 702(a). \nFurthermore, contested factual issues include why Signal allegedly forced the Plaintiffs to \nlive in the โman campsโ and why Signal needed to use an immigrant labor force.  The state of the \nhousing  market  is  arguably  relevant  to  these  issues.    Therefore,  by  offering  a  big  picture \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 18 of 38 PageID #:  7672\nperspective on what the housing market was like during the relevant period, Dr. Gothamโs \ntestimony is helpful.  In short, if the Plaintiffs are going to claim that there was no need for \nSignal to build the โman camps,โ then testimony on the state of the housing market is relevant.   \nc.  Sufficient facts and data  \n  Dr. Gothamโs opinions can be broken into two general categories: (1) general opinions \nabout the impacts of the hurricanes (opinions A through D) and (2) opinions about Signalโs \nactions (opinions E and F).  As to Dr. Gothamโs general testimony, he relies on sufficient facts \nand data to reach general conclusions about the state of the housing market and the difficulty in \nattracting workers to disaster areas.  While the utility of such testimony is questionable, as \ndiscussed above, it meets the admissibility requirements of the Federal Rules of Evidence.  In \naddition, while the Plaintiffs fault him for not considering the data on a granular enough level \n(i.e.,  examining  specific  vacancy  rates),  he  considered  sufficient  data  to  conclude  that  the \nhousing markets were negatively impacted by the hurricanes.    \n  Dr. Gothamโs more specific opinions, however, should be excluded.  As for opinion E, \nDr. Gotham has not reviewed enough specific information about housing availability in close \nproximity to Signalโs facility in Orange, Texas to reach the conclusion that โSignal built on-site \nfacilities to address an acute housing shortage for workers.โ  (Doc. No. 152, Ex. A, p. 34); (see \nalso id. at p. 37) (โ[I]t is my opinion that the dearth of housing availability in Orange County, \nTexas . . . created a major obstacles for businesses in these areas to attract and keep the labor \nnecessary for business and community recovery efforts.โ).  To reach such a specific opinion he \nwould need to look at the housing market in an area in close proximity to Signalโs facility in \nOrange, Texas.  Dr. Gotham has undertaken no such analysis.  He did not consider specific data \nin a narrowly defined region, and even classifies his report as considering โthe state of the \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 19 of 38 PageID #:  7673\nhousing market in general during the years after the disaster.โ  (Doc. No. 152, Ex. B, 68:12โ14.)  \nDr. Gothamโs opinions that housing was impacted by the hurricanes, without something specific \nto the area in question or without facts showing what housing was actually available near \nSignalโs facility, will not support this opinion.  Moreover, the specific data upon which Dr. \nGotham relies focuses on the Mississippi region, not on Texas.  (Doc. No. 152, Ex. A, pp. 37โ\n38.)   \n  As for Opinion F, this opinion is improper because it is not helpful and usurps the role of \nthe jury.  Dr. Gotham is attempting to pass judgment on the propriety of Signalโs actions as they \nrelate to the โman camp.โ  For example, he states that โSignal did not force or coerce the workers \nto stay in the on-site facilityโ (Id. at p. 42); that โno plaintiff was ever required to live in the on-\nsite housing facilities . . . .โ (Id. at p. 41); and that the housing facility benefited the Plaintiffs.  \n(Id. at pp. 41โ42.)  The jury, informed about the state of housing market generally and other \ntestimony, can determine whether Signal actually had no other choice but to build the โman \ncampsโ or that the Plaintiffs benefited from them. \nd.  Conclusion \nFor the reasons stated above, the Plaintiffsโ โMotion to Exclude Kevin Fox Gotham as \nExpertโ (Doc. No. 152) is GRANTED IN PART.  Dr. Gotham may opine about the state of \nhousing in Orange, Texas in general and the correlation between available housing and attracting \nskilled workers.  However, opinions E and F are struck, and he may not opine as to whether there \nwas โan acuteโ housing shortage in Orange, Texas, why Signal built the โman camp,โ whether \nthe Plaintiffs were required or coerced into living at the โman camp,โ or whether the โman \ncampโ actually benefited the Plaintiffs.   \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 20 of 38 PageID #:  7674\nE.  Signalโs โMotion in Limine to Exclude/Limit Testimony of Florence Burkeโ (Doc. No. \n158) \n \n  Florence Burke (โBurkeโ) is the Plaintiffsโ expert on human trafficking.  She is offered to \n(1) โprovide the trier of fact with background on the H2-B guest worker visa program and on \nhuman trafficking in  generalโ and (2) โto demonstrate to the fact-finder that the facts and \ncircumstances of this case as alleged by the Plaintiffs fit within the typical pattern of human \ntrafficking.โ  (Doc. No. 181, p. 1.)  Signal argues that Burkeโs report should be struck for three \nreasons: (1) her report contains legal conclusions; (2) her opinions are unreliable; and (3) she is \nnot qualified to render an opinion regarding the Plaintiffsโ mental state.  (Doc. No. 158.)  \na.  Permissible scope of expert testimony on human trafficking \nCourts  have  reached  varied  conclusions  on  whether  expert  testimony  on  human \ntrafficking is admissible.  Compare Elat v. Ngoubene, 993 F. Supp. 2d 497, 514 (D. Md. 2014) \n(allowing some testimony about human trafficking) with (Doc. No. 2038, David v. Signal Intโl, \nL.L.C., No. 2:08-cv-1220 (E.D. La. Dec. 30, 2014) (striking all expert testimony on human \ntrafficking)).  The issue is that in this context, it is difficult to delineate between an opinion that \nis merely a legal conclusion (i.e., that 18 U.S.C. ยง 1590 was violated) and testimony that \neducates the jury and may be helpful.  While Federal Rule of Evidence 704 โabolish[ed] the per \nse rule against testimony regarding ultimate issues of fact . . . [it] does not open the door to all \nopinions.โ  See Owen v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 698 F.2d 236, 241โ42 (5th Cir. 1983).  โThe \nAdvisory Committee notes make it clear that questions which would merely allow the witness to \ntell the jury what result to reach are not permitted.  Nor is the rule intended to allow a witness to \ngive legal conclusions.โ  Id.  โThe line between a permissible opinion on an ultimate issue and \nan impermissible legal conclusion is not always easy to discern.โ  United States v. McIver, 470 \nF.3d 550, 562 (4th Cir. 2006).  \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 21 of 38 PageID #:  7675\nIn  delineating  the  proper  of  scope  of  expert  testimony  on  human  trafficking,  the \nundersigned must guard against two things.  First, an expert must not be allowed to instruct the \njury on what the legal elements of human trafficking are (i.e., what is needed to prove a violation \nof 18 U.S.C. ยง 1590)โthat is the courtโs job.  Second, an expert must be prevented from telling \nthe  jury  what  conclusion  to  reach  as  to  whether  the  Plaintiffs  were  victims  of  human \ntraffickingโthat is for the jury to decide.  Therefore, the issue is how to delineate between a \ngeneral  discussion  of  human  trafficking,  which  may  help  the  jury  better  understand  the \ncomplexities of human trafficking and is therefore admissible, and reaching a conclusion as to \nwhether these Plaintiffs were victims of human trafficking, which would usurp the role of the \njury.  This difficulty is further compounded by the fact that the term โhuman traffickingโ has \nboth  a  legal  and  a  colloquial  meaning,  further  blurring  the  line  between  permissible  and \nimpermissible testimony. \nThe undersigned finds the appropriate balance to be as follows: Burke may testify about \nโhuman  trafficking  in  general,โ  which  includes  discussing  the  general  features  of  human \ntrafficking schemes, but she may not offer an opinion on whether these Plaintiffs were victims of \nhuman trafficking.  This will allow Burke to educate and inform the jury on the subtleties of \nhuman  trafficking,  which  meets  the  helpfulness  requirement  of  Rule  702,  without  directly \noffering a legal conclusion.  FED. R. CIV. P. 702(a) (requiring that an expertโs specialized \nknowledge โhelp the trier of fact to understand the evidenceโ).  Moreover, allowing Burke to \napply the facts of this case to her general standards would be tantamount to her telling the jury \nwhat conclusion to reach.  See also Elat, 993 F. Supp. 2d at 514 (striking portions of Burkeโs \ntestimony, but allowing her to testify generally about โthe patterns of coercion and threats that \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 22 of 38 PageID #:  7676\nare  typically  present  in  situations  involving  the  exploitation  of  foreign  workersโ  and  other \ngeneral topics relating to human trafficking). \nTwo examples of the scope of permissible and impermissible testimony may be helpful.  \nFirst, the portion of Burkeโs report where she offers background on human trafficking and \ndiscusses  โcommon  features  of  trafficking  situationsโ  is  permissible  because  it  is  purely \ninformative.  (Doc. No. 158, Ex. A, p. 11.)  However, Burke cannot take the next logical step and \nconclude that there was trafficking in this case or opine on how the Plaintiffs were affected.  For \nexample, she states:  โHaving considered Plaintiffsโ accounts of their trafficking experiences, it \nis my opinion that many of the trafficking factors identified above were present in Defendantsโ \nconduct towards them and operated to create a psychologically coercive environment in which a \nreasonable worker in the Plaintiffsโ situation would have felt compelled to continue working for \nSignal.โ  (Id. at p. 12.)  This is nothing more that her evaluating the facts and reaching a \nconclusion that there was traffickingโsuch an analysis is within the province of the jury.   \nSecond, Burke discusses in general terms how victims of human trafficking are often \nmade  a  set  promises  about  what  their  working  conditions  will  be  like,  but  in  reality,  the \nconditions tend to be significantly worse.  (Id. at p. 19.)  This is within the scope of permissible \ntestimony.  Burke, however, crosses the line by stating: โthe Plaintiffs in this case believe they \nwere deceived and betrayed in terms of their employment conditions, living conditions, net \nwages, opportunity to work, overtime hours, and immigration status.โ  (Id. at pp. 19โ20.)  The \njury, after hearing the facts, can evaluate whether the Plaintiffs were deceived. \nThe  above  examples  are  not  the  only  places  where  Burkeโs  opinions  go  too  far.  \nHowever, because her report is so intertwined with permissible and impermissible opinions, the \nundersigned will not attempt to state on a paragraph-by-paragraph (or sentence-by-sentence) \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 23 of 38 PageID #:  7677\nbasis what is excluded from Burkeโs report.  The limitation that she may only opine about the \ncharacteristics of human trafficking in general, and not whether there was trafficking in this case, \nshould suffice.      \nb.  Signalโs other arguments \n  Signal  also  raises  several  other  arguments  as  to  why  Burkeโs  testimony  should  be \nexcluded or limited.  First, Signal argues that Burke misrepresented two of her qualifications, \nand therefore should be struck.  (Doc. No. 158, pp. 2โ3.)  The undersigned disagrees.  A review \nof her experience and training shows Burke has extensive experience working with victims of \nhuman trafficking and is qualified to testify as an expert on human trafficking.  (See id., Ex. A, \npp. 1โ5.)  Whether the school where she obtained her Ph.D. in clinical psychology is accredited \nby the American Psychological Association, or whether her license to be a family counselor in \nCalifornia is still valid, does not impact whether she is qualified as an expert on trafficking.  To \nthe extent that Signal believes that these alleged misstatements affect the weight the jury should \nascribe to her testimony, it can raise such issues on cross-examination.   \nNext, Signal argues that Burkeโs report is unreliable because her interview process is \nflawed and that opinions based on Plaintiffsโ statements are inadmissible.  (Doc. No. 158, pp. 6โ\n9.)  Because Burke is precluded from reaching an opinion on the issue of whether the Plaintiffs \nwere victims of human trafficking, or evaluating the facts of this case as they relate to human \ntrafficking, Signalโs argument is now moot.  (Id. at p. 9.)  Likewise, Signalโs argument that \nBurke is not competent to โreach a final diagnosisโ is no longer at issue, since she will not be \ntestifying as to how these Plaintiffs were impacted.   \n \n \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 24 of 38 PageID #:  7678\nc.  Conclusion \nSignalโs โMotion in Limine to Exclude/Limit Testimony of Florence Burkeโ (Doc. No. \n158) is GRANTED IN PART.  Burkeโs opinions shall be limited to those related to general \ncharacteristics of human trafficking schemes, and Burke is precluded from testifying whether \nthese Plaintiffs were victims of human trafficking or in what ways the facts of this case are \nsimilar to other known cases of human trafficking. \nF.

No.  156)  and \nDewanโs  โMotion  and  Incorporated  Memorandum  to  Exclude  Expert  Witness \nTestimonyโ (Doc. No. 159) \n \nSignal designated Louise Shelley, Ph.D. (โDr. Shelleyโ) to testify as an expert on โhuman \ntrafficking and related organized crime.โ  (Doc. No. 180, p. 1.)  Dr. Shelley received her Ph.D. in \nSociology from the University of Pennsylvania, and is currently a professor at the School of \nPublic Policy at George Mason University.  Her forty-five page report leads to one ultimate \nconclusion: โSignal was not engaged in human trafficking at any stage of the process with the \nH2B workers, either at recruitment, on their arrival in the United States or in their employ.โ  \n(Doc. No. 180, Ex. B, p. 44.)3  The Plaintiffs seek to exclude Dr. Shelleyโs report, arguing that: \n(1) her report contains numerous legal conclusions; (2) her methodology is not valid; (3) her \ntestimony is not helpful; and (4) she impermissibly assesses the witnessesโ credibility.  Dewan \n                                                           \n3.  There appears to be a question about what is the operative report in this case.  Signal seems to assume \nthat it is the forty-five page report that was served in David, the parallel case in the Eastern District of Louisiana, \nwhile the Plaintiffs only attached a shorter version of Dr. Shelleyโs report that was apparently served in this case.  \nThe report served in David is fourteen pages longer and, according to Signal, โwas a revision that contained \nadditional information beyond that specific to the David plaintiffs.โ  (Doc. No. 180, p. 1.)  It is unclear whether the \nDavid report was served in this case, and if it was, whether it was timely.  As discussed above, parties cannot simply \nsubmit a more robust expert report under the guise that it is a supplemental report.  However, after reviewing both \nversions of Dr. Shelleyโs report, the undersigned finds that, for reasons discussed below, much (if not all) of what \nwas added to the David report is struck.  For instance, some of the added material in the David report consists of Dr. \nShelleyโs evaluation of the trustworthiness of the certain statements made by the plaintiffs in David.  Compare (Doc. \nNo.  156, Ex. B) with (Doc. No. 168, Ex. B, pp. 20โ25.)  Therefore, it makes no material difference what report is \nthe operative report, and because the Plaintiffs have not shown how they were prejudiced by the David report, had \nthe opportunity to depose Dr. Shelley regarding this report, and did not move to have Dr. Shelleyโs report limited to \nthe shorter version served in this case, the David report will be considered the operative report.   \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 25 of 38 PageID #:  7679\nalso seeks to exclude Dr. Shelleyโs testimony, arguing that she โmakes blanket, unfounded \nassertions that the Dewan Defendants engaged in fraudulent conduct . . . .โ  (Doc. No. 159, p. 4.)   \na.  Dr. Shelleyโs report contains impermissible legal conclusions \n  The Plaintiffs argue that Dr. Shelleyโs report should be struck because it is โreplete with \nlegal conclusionsโ and โ[t]hese conclusions fall far outside the scope of permissible expert \ntestimony . . . .โ  (Doc. No. 156, p. 5.)  The Plaintiffs first argue that Dr. Shelley offers numerous \nlegal conclusions about human trafficking.  For the same reasons that the Plaintiffsโ human \ntrafficking expert report was limited, Dr. Shelleyโs report must also be limited.  Therefore, Dr. \nShelleyโs opinions are subject to the same limitation discussed above: Dr. Shelley may only \ndiscuss the general characteristics of human trafficking, but may not opine as to whether these \nPlaintiffs were in fact victims of human trafficking. \n  In addition, the Plaintiffs move to exclude four other alleged legal conclusions reached by \nDr. Shelley.  At the outset, because Dr. Shelleyโs testimony is limited to only a discussion about \nhuman trafficking generally, this part of the Plaintiffsโ motion is now moot.  However, for \nclarity, the undersigned will address the Plaintiffsโ arguments.  First, the Plaintiffs claim that Dr. \nShelley offers an opinion on a โnon-existentโ debt bondage claim.  A part of her report does \naddress debt bondage.  (Doc. No. 180, Ex. B, pp. 11โ12) (โ[T]here was no debt bondage in this \ncase under either the American or UN definition.โ).  Debt bondage has a specific legal definition, \nand differs from the Plaintiffsโ claim that the financial debts they incurred forced them to \ncontinue working for Signal.  See 22 U.S.C. ยง7102(5) (defining debt bondage as โthe status or \ncondition of a debtor arising from a pledge by the debtor of his or her personal services or those \nof a person under his control as a security for debtโ).  The Plaintiffs have not made a claim of \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 26 of 38 PageID #:  7680\ndebt bondage.  Accordingly, because Dr. Shelleyโs opinion regarding debt bondage does not \nrelate to any cause of action or issue in this case, it is inadmissible.  See Roman, 691 F.3d at 694. \nNext, Dr. Shelley claims that โSignal was exempt from OSHA standards for the housing \nof its H2-B workers . . . .โ  (Doc. No. 156, p. 7.)  Dr. Shelley is not qualified to offer an opinion \non the applicability of OSHA, therefore, this opinion is struck.  Third, the Plaintiffs seek to strike \nan opinion reached based on a letter issued by the United States Department of Justice Special \nCounsel  for  Immigration  Related  Unfair  Labor  Practices.    She  opines  that  because  the \ngovernment found that Signal had not engaged in any unfair immigration related employment \npractices, and this necessarily includes coercion, there could be no trafficking.  The Plaintiffs \nargue that this letter did not address Signalโs actions and does not support a conclusion that the \nPlaintiffs were not trafficked.  Because Dr. Shelley may only testify about human trafficking \ngenerally, and may not opine as to whether there was trafficking in this case, there is no need for \nher to discuss this letter.  Therefore, her opinions based on this letter are struck.  Lastly, the \nPlaintiffs  argue  that  Dr.  Shelley  offers  opinions  on  the  law  of  agency.   According  to  the \nPlaintiffs, the numerous references that she makes regarding Signalโs role in the allegedly false \npromises  made  to  the Plaintiffs  is  tantamount  to  an  opinion  on  agency.    The  undersigned \ndisagreesโDr.  Shelley  does  not  offer  any  opinions  on  agency  law.    However,  as  will  be \ndiscussed below, such comments on the evidence are not helpful, and therefore, are struck from \nher report. \nb.  Helpful \n  The Plaintiffs argue that Dr. Shelleyโs opinions do not assist the trier of fact because they \nmerely regurgitate Signalโs theory of the case.  (Id. at pp. 11โ13.)  This is a fair characterization \nof much of Dr. Shelleyโs report.  Large portions of her report read more like  an opening \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 27 of 38 PageID #:  7681\nstatement than an expert report.  For example, she โopinesโ that: โSignal did not obtain workers \nfor its facilities in Texas and Mississippi through the use of force, fraud, or coercionโ (Doc. No.  \n180, Ex. B, p. 9); โBurnett might have engaged in deceptive promises, but as the chronology \npresented by the plaintiffs in the third amended complaint [demonstrates], Signal was not a part \nof any deceptive promisesโ (Id. at p. 18); โSignal did not promise the workers green cards, and \nthey did not learn that this promise had been made by the recruiters until after the workers \narrived at Signal[โs] facilitiesโ  (Id. at p. 19); โThe Indian H2B workers did not have their \npassports or visas confiscatedโ (Id. at p. 38); and โ[i]n reviewing the thousands of Signal emails, \nI saw nothing in them reflecting any effort to economize on the workers or to shortchange them.โ  \n(Id. at p. 41.)  These are just a few examples of many. \n  Because Dr. Shelleyโs opinions are limited to those related to the general characteristics \nof trafficking, such commentary on what the evidence establishes will not be allowed. \nc.  Reliability and methodology \nThe Plaintiffs next argue, โ[f]or many of her opinions, Dr. Shelley asks this Court to \nmake โscientifically unsupported leaps of faith in the causal chainโโ (Doc. No. 156, p. 9) (quoting \nRider v. Sandoz Pharm. Corp., 295 F.3d 1194, 1202 (11th Cir. 2012)).  For example, they claim \nthat Dr. Shelley supports her opinion that there was no trafficking in this case by erroneously \ndrawing a conclusion from a report done by the Texas Task Force on Human Trafficking.  (Doc. \nNo. 156, pp. 9โ10.)  Dr. Shelley may not opine as to whether there was trafficking in this case, \nand therefore, there is no need for her to discuss this report.  Moreover, after reviewing the report \nupon which Dr. Shelley relied, the undersigned agrees with the Plaintiffsโ assertion that Dr. \nShelley is making too great a leap in claiming that this report actually absolves Signal of \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 28 of 38 PageID #:  7682\ntrafficking.4  (See Doc. No. 180, Ex. B, p. 14) (opining that the โTexas State Task Force Report \nreveals that law enforcement authorities were working on trafficking in the region of Orange, \nTexas and both the Texas Task Force and the Bureau of Justice Statistics determined that the \nSignal case was not trafficking . . . .โ).  This report does not discuss this case, nor does it purport \nto be a discussion of all trafficking cases in Texas.  Furthermore, this is just one example; Dr. \nShelley offers numerous โopinionsโ that are reached through a less than rigorous analysis.  \nBecause her testimony is limited to discussing the general features of human trafficking schemes, \nthese portions of her report are no longer in the case.  However, because her report is replete with \nthese types of remarks, the undersigned reiterates that any testimony given by Dr. Shelley at trial \nmust meet the requirements of Rule 702.5 \nd.  Dr. Shelley improperly assesses the witnessesโ credibility and character \nThe Plaintiffs also seek to strike portions of Dr. Shelleyโs report where she assesses the \ncredibility of the witnesses.  (Doc. No. 156, pp. 14โ15.)  Signal responds that Dr. Shelley is not \npassing on the witnessesโ credibility, but rather, merely elucidating the bases for her opinions.  \nThe undersigned is not persuaded.  (Doc. No. 180, p. 22.)  Dr. Shelley expressly opines about the \ncharacter and truthfulness of certain witnesses.  For example, at her deposition she testified that \nSignal management had โgreat concernโ for the Indian workersโa sentiment that is echoed in \nher report.  The jury, without the assistance of Dr. Shelley, can evaluate whether this is true.  \n                                                           \n4.  See Office of the Attorney General, The Texas Response to Human Trafficking (2008), available at \nhttps://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/cj/human-trafficking.      \n \n5.  Dr. Shelley, particularly in the David report, which is the operative report, draws numerous conclusions \nderived from questionable analysis.  For example, Dr. Shelley opines, โ[e]xamining Slides 1, 2, and 3 of Signalโs \nsafety performance reveals that is has an extremely low rate of accidents.โ  (Doc. No. 180, Ex. B, p. 35.)  As \ndiscussed above, reaching such a conclusion requires balancing Signalโs safety record against identifiable standards.  \nSee infra III.A.b.  In addition, she claims that the food was good and nutritious because she ate at a restaurant run by \nthe same caterer years later.  (See Doc. No. 180, Ex. B, p. 28).     \n \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 29 of 38 PageID #:  7683\nThis is just one example of many. 6   Accordingly, Dr. Shelley may not opine as to the credibility, \ntruthfulness, or character of any of the parties or witnesses in this case.  \ne.  Dr. Shelleyโs testimony as it relates to Dewan is improper \nDr. Shelley asserts in numerous places throughout her report that Dewan engaged in \neither deceptive or fraudulent practices.  (See, e.g., Doc. No. 180, Ex. B, pp. 9, 18โ19, 22, 26.)  \nSuch  testimony  is  improper  because  it  is  unhelpful.    Whether  Dewan  committed  fraud  or \nengaged in deceptive practices is something the jury can readily evaluate on their own after \nhearing the evidenceโthere is no need for expert testimony on this point.  Dr. Shelley cannot \nsimply regurgitate Signalโs theory of the case through expert testimony.   Accordingly, Dr. \nShelley shall be precluded from opining about Dewanโs conduct. \nf.  Conclusion \n  Much of Dr. Shelleyโs report consists of impermissible legal conclusions, advocacy, \nassessment of the witnessesโ credibility, and unreliable and unfounded opinions.  However, Dr. \nShelley  does  devote  a  few  paragraphs  of  her  report  to  discussing  the  elements  of  human \ntrafficking generally, and even opines that the Plaintiffsโ expert does not identify all elements \nthat are โcentral to labor trafficking.โ  (Doc. No. 180, Ex. B, p. 35.)7  This portion of Shelleyโs \nreport is acceptable; the remainder of Dr. Shelleyโs report is not. \n  Therefore, for the reasons stated above, the Plaintiffsโ โMotion to Exclude Dr. Louise \nShelley as Expertโ (Doc. No. 156) is GRANTED IN PART.  Dr. Shelleyโs testimony is limited \n                                                           \n6.  Some of the added material in the David report consists of Dr. Shelleyโs assessment of the certain \nstatements.  (Doc. No. 180, Ex. B.)  For example, she states that โKurian Davidโs T-visa application is full of \nincorrect statementsโ (Id. at p. 21); โHemant Khuttanโs declaration raises many questions as to its veracity and the \nvalidity of his complaintsโ (Id. at 22); and she notes an alleged contradiction in Sony Vadusevan-Sulekhaโs \nstatement by stating that โthe problem with his statement is that Signal never had any pictures of housing or \nresidential facilities on its website.  This is a fantasy not reality.โ  (Id. at p. 23.)  Such โopinionsโ are improper. \n \n7.  These opinions, which are the only opinions that Dr. Shelley may offer, were also contained in the \nreport served in this case.  (See, e.g., Doc. No. 156, Ex. B, pp. 15, 23.) \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 30 of 38 PageID #:  7684\nto a discussion of the general elements and characteristics of human trafficking.  She, however, \nmay not opine on whether these Plaintiffs were victims of human trafficking, the credibility of \nthe  Plaintiffs,  or  offer  her  assessment  of  the  facts  of  this  case.    Dewanโs  โMotion  and \nIncorporated  Memorandum  to  Exclude  Expert  Witness  Testimonyโ  (Doc.  No.  159)  is \nGRANTED, and Dr. Shelleyโs opinions as they relate to Dewan are struck. \nG.  The Plaintiffsโ โMotion to Limit the Testimony of Enrique Gonzalez, III as Expertโ \n(Doc. No. 155) and Burnettโs โMotion and Memorandum in Support to Exclude Legal \nOpinion Testimony of Signalโs Immigration Law Expertโ (Doc. No. 153) \nSignalโs expert, Enrique Gonzalez (โGonzalezโ), an immigration lawyer, โprepared a \nreport addressing various ethical and U.S. immigration law issues as they pertain to the conduct \nof the various parties involved in this case.โ  (Doc. No. 155, Ex. A, p. 1.)  The Plaintiffs moved \nto strike Gonzalezโs opinion II and six other โstray remarks.โ  (Doc. No. 155, pp. 4โ7.)  Signal \nresponded by arguing that Gonzalez was not โretained to provide an opinion on plaintiffsโ \nconduct in this case and concedes that he will not testify at trial to any individual plaintiffsโ \nconduct, nor that of any plaintiffs collectively.โ  (Doc. No. 176, p. 1.)  However, Signal claims \nthat  Gonzalezโs  opinion  II  is  โessential  for  the  development  of  [his]  subsequent  opinions \nregarding Burnett.โ  (Id. at pp. 1โ2.)   \nIn addition, Burnett moved to exclude a large portion of Gonzalezโs report, arguing that it \ncontains impermissible legal conclusions.  (Doc. No. 153.)  Signal responded and claimed that \nGonzalezโs report was not โproffered to circumvent the fact finding role of the jury,โ but that \nโthe  facts  and  the  pertinent  regulations  are  so  intertwined  that  they  must  be  presented  in \nconjunction,โ and therefore, his opinions are admissible in their entirety.  (Doc. No. 175, p. 1.) \n \n \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 31 of 38 PageID #:  7685\na.  Due to the severance and transfer of Signalโs cross-claims, Gonzalezโs opinions \nII-V are no longer relevant \n \nGonzalez offers five opinions.  (Doc. No. 155, Ex. A.)  Because Signalโs cross-claims \nagainst Burnett and others were recently severed and transferred to  the Eastern  District  of \nLouisiana, opinions III through V are no longer relevant, and therefore, are inadmissible.  (Doc. \nNo. 205.)  These opinions focus on duties owed by an immigration attorney to its client, and the \nstandard of care that an immigration attorney should maintain.  In other words, they are aimed at \nsupporting Signalโs claims against Burnett for malpractice and breach of fiduciary dutyโclaims \nthat are no longer at issue in this case.  \nIn addition, the undersigned finds Gonzalezโs opinion II is not helpful, and therefore, \ninadmissible.  He opines that: โForeign nationals seeking an H-2B visa are considered to have \ncommitted immigration fraud if they deliberately conceal their intent to remain permanently in \nthe United States from a U.S. consular or immigration officer.โ  (Doc. No. 155, Ex. A, p. 24.)  \nThere  is  no  cause  of  action  in  this  case  that  centers  on  whether  the  Plaintiffs  committed \nimmigration fraud.  While Signal may argue that the Plaintiffs in fact concealed their true intent \nin applying for H-2B visas, there is no need for expert testimony opining as to whether this \namounts to immigration fraud.  Signalโs primary argument that opinion II should not be struck is \nthat it is โessential for the development of Gonzalezโs subsequent opinions regarding Burnett.โ  \n(Doc. No. 176, pp. 1โ2.)  However, these subsequent opinions have been struck, therefore, this \nargument is without merit.   \nAccordingly, the undersigned strikes opinions II-V. \nb.  Other โstray remarksโ are inadmissible \nThe Plaintiffs also move to exclude six other โstray remarksโ that they claim are aimed at \nthem and are impermissible.  Two examples are illustrative.  First, Gonzalez states: โThe intent \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 32 of 38 PageID #:  7686\nby  the  foreign  nationals  and  other  companies  was  for  the  workers  to  remain  in  the  U.S. \npermanently.โ  (Doc. No. 155, Ex. A, p. 14.)  Second, by โcounseling foreign nationals to lie to \nimmigration officers about their intent to remain in the U.S., Mr. Burnett, as well as the foreign \nnationals, knowingly committed immigration fraud.โ  (Id. at p. 15.) \nIt appears that Gonzalez is inferring that the Plaintiffs committed these acts, even though  \nGonzalez unequivocally testified that he is not offering any opinions on the Plaintiffsโ conduct.  \n(Doc. No. 155, Ex. B, 191:6โ13.)  There is simply no other way to interpret his assertion that \nโthe  foreign  nationalsโ  (i.e.,  the  Plaintiffs)  โknowingly  committed  immigration  fraudโ  by \nallegedly  lying  about  their  intent.    Therefore,  to  prevent  any  unnecessary  confusion  that \nGonzalez is opining about the Plaintiffsโ conduct, these remarks are struck.  Moreover, these \nremarks are offered in Gonzalezโs report to illustrate how Burnett allegedly breached his duties.  \nBecause opinions about Burnettโs duties as an immigration lawyer are no longer relevant to this \ncase, there is no need for such stray remarks.  Accordingly, the Plaintiffsโ motion is granted.   \nc.  Gonzalezโs opinion I \nAll that remains is Gonzalezโs opinion I, in which he states: โit is not immigration fraud \nto indicate to the U.S. government that the need for H2-B workers is on a temporary basis, and \nthen to seek an extension after extreme natural disasters like Hurricanes Rita and Katrina.โ  \n(Doc. No. 155, Ex. A, p. 24.)  The Plaintiffs do not take issue with this opinion.  Moreover, \nBurnett does not specifically argue that this opinion should be struck, but rather claims generally \nthat โthis Court should limit any testimony by Plaintiffsโ and Signalโs experts to the general \nprocess for obtaining non-immigrant visas and permanent work resident visasโ and not allow \nexperts to offer โany legal opinion as to what the law is or whether or not any applicable laws or \nregulations were breached by anyone.โ  (Doc. No. 153, p. 11.)  \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 33 of 38 PageID #:  7687\n  Opinion I straddles the line between being a legal conclusion and helpful testimony on \nthe immigration process generally.   On the one hand, Gonzalez should be prevented from \ntestifying  outright  that  Signal  did  not  commit  immigration  fraud.    This  would  be  a  legal \nconclusion.    However,  looking  at  this  opinion  within  in  the  context  of  Gonzalezโs  report, \nGonzalez does not do this.  This opinion is contained in the background section of his report, and \nis part of his discussion of the immigration process generally.  Moreover, he never actually \nconcludes that Signal did not commit immigration fraud (even though that is what can be \ninferred).  Therefore, opinion I is proper.  While Gonzalezโs opinion comes close to offering a \nlegal conclusion, it is not inadmissible.  At trial, however, the parties will need to be vigilant to \nensure that the phrasing of any questions do not elicit a pure legal conclusion.  See, e.g., Owen, \n698 F.2d at 240 (discussing that the way a question is phrased may elicit an improper legal \nconclusion) (citing FED. R. EVID. 704 advisory committeeโs notes).   \nd.  Conclusion \nBecause Signalโs cross-claims have been transferred, the undersigned strikes opinions III-\nV of Gonzalezโs report as irrelevant.  The Plaintiffsโ โMotion to Limit the Testimony of Enrique \nGonzalez, III as Expertโ (Doc. No. 155) is GRANTED and the undersigned strikes Gonzalezโs \nopinion II.  Moreover, the six โstray remarksโ identified by the Plaintiffs are also struck, and \nGonzalez  is  precluded  from  offering  testimony  that  appears  to  opine  about  the  Plaintiffsโ \nconduct.  Burnettโs โMotion and Memorandum in Support to Exclude Legal Opinion Testimony \nof Signalโs Immigration Law Expertโ (Doc. No. 153) is GRANTED IN PART and Gonzalez \nmay  not  offer  โany  testimony  as  to  his  opinions  of  the  law, . . .  [or]  opinions[,] . . . legal \nconclusions[,] or interpretation of what the evidence establishes.โ  Gonzalez may, however, \ndiscuss the H2-B visa program generally and the general process for obtaining such visas.  \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 34 of 38 PageID #:  7688\nH.  Signalโs โMotion in Limine to Exclude/Limit Testimony of Amy Mowlโ (Doc. No. 157) \n  Signal moves to exclude or limit the testimony of the Plaintiffsโ expert, Amy Mowl.  \n(Doc. No. 157.)  Mowl is an economist, and is currently on the faculty of the Institute for \nFinancial  Management  and  Research  Business  School  in  Chennai,  India.    The  Plaintiffs \ndesignated Mowl to provide โa culturally specific socio-economic context to assist the jury in \nunderstanding the nature of the debts incurred by Plaintiffs in India to pay hefty recruitment fees \ncharged by Defendants.โ  (Doc. No. 182, p. 1.)  Signal seeks to exclude or limit Mowlโs \ntestimony on three grounds: (1) she makes impermissible credibility determinations; (2) her \ntestimony regarding suicide must be limited; and (3) โMowl uses insufficient information and \nunreliable principles or methods in forming her opinions.โ  (Doc. No. 157.) \na.  Credibility Determination \n  Signal argues that Mowl passes on the credibility of the Plaintiffsโ statements, and that \nher โopinions impermissibly regurgitate[] the Plaintiffsโ testimony stamped with the imprimatur \nof  her  expertise.โ    (Doc.  No.  157,  p.  5.)    The  undersigned  disagrees  with  Signalโs \ncharacterization of Mowlโs approach.  Mowl testified that she received sworn statements made \nby the Plaintiffs, and because they were sworn, assumed they were true.  (Id., Ex. B, 46:19โ\n47:16.)    In  addition,  when  questioned  about  whether  she  examined  the  truthfulness  of  the \nPlaintiffsโ statements, she said she did not because they were consistent with what she knows \nabout Indian finance products.  (Id.)  This is not the same as opining that the statements are in \nfact true.   \n  Signal attempts to argue that Mowlโs opinions are similar to ones that were struck in Elat \nv. Ngoubene.  (Doc. No. 157, p. 5.)  In Elat, the expert weighed two competing sets of facts, and \nconcluded that the plaintiffโs version of the facts was more credible than the defendantsโ.

Supp. 2d at 513โ14 (noting that the expertโs โevaluation of the truthfulness of Plaintiffโs \nversion of the underlying events as compared to Defendantsโ is little different from the way that \njuries themselves determine credibility from conflicting testimony.โ).  The expert then used the \nplaintiffโs version of the facts as the basis for her opinion.  Id.  Mowl did not undertake such an \nanalysis.  She merely took the plaintiffsโ statements at face value and felt she could because they \nwere consistent with what she expected based on her experience.  This is the same as forming an \nopinion based on documents produced in discovery.  \nb.  Testimony regarding suicide8 \nTo illustrate the effect that debts can have on people in India, Mowl discusses a recent \nwave of suicides by Indian farm workers.  (Doc. No. 157, Ex. A, pp. 17โ20.)  Signal seeks to \nexclude this part of Mowlโs report on two grounds.  First, Signal argues that her sources are \nfaulty.  Mowlโs sources were Indian newspapers.  Signal has pointed to no reason why the \nreliability or truthfulness of these sources should be doubted.  Moreover, this type of challenge \ngoes to the weight that the fact finder should ascribe to the opinions, not their admissibility.  See \n14.38 Acres of Land, 80 F.3d at 1077 (โAs a general rule, questions relating to the bases and \nsources of an expertโs opinion affect the weight to be assigned that opinion rather than its \nadmissibility and should be left for the juryโs consideration.โ).   \nSecond, Signal claims that Mowl has not offered any form of โpeer-reviewed or other \nauthoritative sourceโ showing that suicide rates amongst the farming community are relevant or \nsimilar to those amongst the non-farming community.  (Doc. No. 157, p. 6); see also Daubert, \n509 U.S. at 592โ93 (noting that one of the indicia of reliability is whether the expertโs theory or \ntechnique has been subject to peer review).  While courts have struck expert testimony when \nthere is too large of an analytic gap, the undersigned does not find that such a gap exists here.  \n                                                           \n8.  Signal did not argue that such testimony may be unfairly prejudicial.  See FED. R. EVID. 403.  \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 36 of 38 PageID #:  7690\nSee also Pipitone, 288 F.3d at 244 (discussing that โthe factors identified in Daubert may or may \nnot pertinent in assessing reliabilityโ).  Mowl does not need to show a direct correlation between \nfarm worker and non-farm worker suicide rates to draw an analogy.  Furthermore, Signal has \npointed to no studies that Mowl has ignored, and the undersigned finds it unlikely that such \nstudies have ever been conducted.  \nc.  Sufficiency of information and reliability of principles \nSignal next argues that Mowl has not reviewed sufficient information.  Signal faults her \nfor โnot consider[ing] the pay data produced by Signal as part of its ESI productions,โ โfailing to \nrequest any banking records,โ and not reviewing the deposition of Sachin Dewan.  (Doc. No. \n157, pp. 6โ8.)  The undersignedโs role, however, is to ensure that expert testimony is โbased on \nsufficient facts or dataโโnot to ensure that an expert left no stone unturned.  FED. R. EVID. 702.  \nHere, after reviewing her report, the undersigned finds that Mowl has met this threshold.  Mowl \nlists  over  forty  sources  that  she  considered  in  drafting  her  report.    Also,  a  review  of  her \ndeposition  shows  that  she  had  cogent  reasons  for  choosing  not  to  review  certain  sources.  \nFurthermore, an argument that an expert โdid not review sufficient fats and data goes to the \nweight of [its] opinion, to be brought out in cross-examination and resolved by the jury, not to \nadmissibility.โ  Suzion Wind Energy Corp. v. Shippers Stevedoring Co., 662 F. Supp. 2d 623, \n667 (S.D. Tex. 2009).  \nd.  Conclusion \nAccordingly, Signalโs โMotion in Limine to Exclude/Limit Testimony of Amy Mowlโ \n(Doc. No. 157) is DENIED. \n \n \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 37 of 38 PageID #:  7691\nIV. Conclusion \n  The undersigned finds as follows: \n๏ท  The  Plaintiffsโ  โMotion  to  Exclude  Ron  J.  McAlear  as  Expertโ  (Doc.  No.  150)  is \nGRANTED IN PART.  McAlear may testify about general industry practices and opine \nas to whether Signalโs practices are consistent with these customs.  However, McAlear \nmay not opine that Signal is a safe company or has an โexemplary safety recordโ; \n   \n๏ท  The  Plaintiffsโ  โMotion  to  Exclude  Virginia  Miles  as  Expertโ  (Doc.  No.  151)  is \nDENIED; \n \n๏ท  The Plaintiffsโ โMotion to Exclude Donald H. Strobel as Expertโ (Doc. No. 154) is \nGRANTED subject to reconsideration should the court at a later time allow the Plaintiffs \nto file FLSA claims in this case; \n \n๏ท  The Plaintiffsโ โMotion to Exclude Kevin Fox Gotham as Expertโ (Doc. No. 152) is \nGRANTED IN PART.  Dr. Gotham may opine about the state of housing in Orange, \nTexas in general and the correlation between available housing and attracting skilled \nworkers (opinions A through D).  However, opinions E and F are struck, and he may not \nopine as to whether there was โan acuteโ housing shortage in Orange, Texas, why Signal \nbuilt the โman camp,โ whether the Plaintiffs were required or coerced into living at the \nโman camp,โ or whether the โman campโ actually benefited the Plaintiffs; \n \n๏ท  Signalโs โMotion in Limine to Exclude/Limit Testimony of Florence Burkeโ (Doc. No. \n158) is GRANTED IN PART.  Burkeโs opinions shall be limited to those related to \ngeneral  characteristics  of  human  trafficking  schemes,  and  Burke  is  precluded  from \ntestifying as to whether these Plaintiffs were victims of human trafficking or in what \nways the facts of this case are similar to other known cases of human trafficking; \n \n๏ท  The Plaintiffsโ โMotion to Exclude Dr. Louise Shelley as Expertโ (Doc. No. 156) is \nGRANTED IN PART.  Dr. Shelleyโs testimony is limited to a discussion of the general \nelements and characteristics of human trafficking, and she may not opine on whether \nthese Plaintiffs were victims of human trafficking, the credibility of the Plaintiffs, or offer \nher assessment of the facts of this case; \n \n๏ท  Defendants Sachin Dewan and Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd.โs โMotion and Incorporated \nMemorandum to Exclude Expert Witness Testimonyโ (Doc. No. 159) is GRANTED and \nthe undersigned strikes Dr. Shelleyโs opinions about Dewan; \n \n๏ท  The Plaintiffsโ โMotion to Limit the Testimony of Enrique Gonzalez, III as Expertโ (Doc. \nNo. 155) is GRANTED.  The undersigned strikes Opinion II and the six other identified \nโstray remarksโ identified by the Plaintiffs;  \n   \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 222   Filed 02/12/15   Page 38 of 38 PageID #:  7692\n๏ท  Burnettโs โMotion and Memorandum in Support to Exclude Legal Opinion Testimony of \nSignalโs Immigration Law Expertโ (Doc. No. 153) is GRANTED IN PART and the \nundersigned strikes opinions III-V.  Moreover, Gonzalez may not offer any testimony as \nto his opinions of the law, or opinions, legal conclusions, or interpretation of what the \nevidence establishes.  Gonzalez may, however, discuss the H2-B visa program generally \nand the general process for obtaining such visas;  \n \n๏ท  Signalโs โMotion in Limine to Exclude/Limit Testimony of Amy Mowlโ (Doc. No. 157) \nis DENIED. \n \nV. Objections \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(c) (Supp. IV 2011), each party to this action has the \nright  to  file objections to  this order.

Nos. 338, 339, 340, 341 and 343], the Signal \nEntities filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code \non July 12, 2015.  In re Signal Intโl, Inc, et al., No. 15-11498 (Bankr. D. Del. July 12, 2015) (the \nโBankruptcy Courtโ).1  On November 24, 2015, the Bankruptcy Court entered its Findings of \nFact,  Conclusions  of  Law  and  Order  Confirming  Debtorsโ  First  Amended  Joint  Plan  of \nLiquidation Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code [ECF No. 555] (the โConfirmation \n                                                 \n1 The other entities are:  Signal Ship Repair, LLC (Case No. 15-11499), Signal Intโl, LLC (Case \nNo. 15-11500), Signal Intโl Texas GP, LLC (Case No. 15-11501), and Signal Intโl Texas, L.P. \n(Case  No.  15-11502).

Pursuant to the Plan, a \nlitigation  trust  (the  โSignal  Litigation  Trustโ)  has  been  created  for  the  distribution  of  the \nsettlement proceeds.  That process remains ongoing, as the Signal Litigation Trust distributed \nTrust Claim Forms in February, 2016.  Initial partial payments on accepted claims have been \ndistributed this month.   \nThe Plan became effective on December 14, 2015 [Bankr. Dkt. No. 589].

(Reports prior to the Sixth Report were from all parties, but counsel for a Defendant in \nthis action noted lack of current involvement in Signalโs bankruptcy proceedings, so counsel for \nPlaintiffs is responsible for this report.) \nAs noted in the partiesโ prior reports [Dkt. Nos. 338, 339, 340, 341, 343, and 344], the \nSignal Entities filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United \nStates Code on July 12, 2015.

Pursuant \nto the Plan, a litigation trust (the โSignal Litigation Trustโ) has been created for the distribution \nof  the  settlement  proceeds.    That  process  remains  ongoing,  as  the  Signal  Litigation  Trust \ndistributed Trust Claim Forms in February, 2016.  Initial partial payments on accepted claims \nwere distributed in July, 2017.   \nThe Plan became effective on December 14, 2015 [Bankr. Dkt. No. 589].

' \nCASE NO.:  1:13-CV-324 (RC) \n  ' \nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL, LLC, ET AL  ' \n' \n \nORDER ON LIMITATIONS OF TRIAL TIME \n \nThis case is set for a final pretrial hearing on April 2, 2015, with trial on April 6, 2015. The \ncourt gave the parties notice that it would impose time limits on the presentation of their cases at \ntrial.  The court has reviewed the submissions of the parties and for the reasons stated allots time \nas follows: \nIt  has  long  been  recognized  by  trial  lawyers,  that  โ[a]  shorter  trial  promotes  jury \ncomprehension.โ Manual for Complex Litigation (Fourth) ยง 12.3 (2004). The Federal Rules of \nProcedure โshould be construed and administered to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive \ndetermination of every action and proceeding.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  โA trial court is required to \nโexercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting \nevidenceโ in order to ensure that evidence is presented effectively for the ascertainment of truth, \ntime is conserved, and witnesses are protected from harassment.  See Fed. R. Evid. 611(a).โ  \nUnited States v. Hill, 643 F.3d 807, 845 (11th Cir. 2011). \nโ[M]any jurors expect information to be presented succinctly, even where it deals with \ncomplex matters.โ Manual for Complex Litigation (Fourth) ยง 12.3 (2004). This court is well aware \nthat many lawyers fear that jurors may not have understood a point the first, third, fifth, or tenth \ntime it is mentioned.  But the undersigned has met with the jury in each case tried in this court.  \n \n  Page 1 of  4 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 286   Filed 03/17/15   Page 2 of 4 PageID #:  8807\nInvariably a juror asks โwhy do the lawyers keep repeating themselves?โ As one juror commented \nto the undersigned, โI am a teacher. I understand the rule about โtell an audience what you plan to \ntell them, tell them, and then tell them what you told them.โ That is three times.  We donโt need to \nhear it ten times.โ   \nEssentially the same case has been tried once against these Defendants in New Orleans.  \nSo, counsel should be familiar with what testimony will be presented and how it may be \nsummarized.  Counsel are expected to be familiar with Fed. R. Evid. 1006 and the savings in time \nthat can be achieved by use of skillfully prepared summaries, as well as charts, timelines, diagrams \nand photos. See William W. Schwarzer, Reforming Jury Trials , 132 F.R.D. 575, 578 (1991).  \nCounsel should also consider  approved time saving techniques such as:  the use of properly \nprepared affidavits to support the admission of those business records for which there is no \nagreement as to authenticity;   using an expertโs rรฉsumรฉ as an exhibit to save time on his \nintroduction;  submission of extracts of voluminous exhibits containing only  the pertinent \npages; and  proper use of the time allowed for interim statements to quickly transition between \ntopics, and to inform jurors about expected testimony.  \nJurors shall be provided with a notebook to aid in their comprehension of the case. Counsel \nshould discuss:  definitions of terms, diagrams, key exhibits, timelines, etc. for inclusion in juror \nnotebooks.  Parties shall cooperate in providing the court with a page for each sideโs witnesses, \ncontaining a photograph of the witness (about 3\" x 3\") with the witnessโs name, title (or position, if \nemployed by a party), and space for jurors to take notes, for inclusion in each  juror notebook;  \nSee Manual for Complex Litigation (Fourth) ยงยง 12.3, 12.31, 12.32, 12.422 (2004) \nTime was requested for experts to opine on the law of immigration and other topics. The court \nwill determine what law applies to the case and instruct the jury on the law as necessary.  Expert \n \n  Page 2 of  4 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 286   Filed 03/17/15   Page 3 of 4 PageID #:  8808\ntestimony on the law of immigration and on most other topics  is not appropriate. See, e.g., \nAskanase v. Fatjo, 130 F.3d 657, 673 (5th Cir. 1997); Thompson v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 34 \nF.3d 932, 941 (10th Cir. 1994); Specht v. Jensen, 853 F.2d 805 (10th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 488 \nU.S. 1008 (1989). \nThe court=s decision is based in part upon requests for time for more than one expert on a \nsingle topic and time for several witnesses concerning the same limited facts. Such testimony is \nrepetitive  at  best,  and  confusing  and  contradictory  at  worst.    See  William  W.  Schwarzer, \nReforming Jury Trials, 132 F.R.D. 575, 578 (1991). \nThe parties were ordered to provide the court with estimates of time needed for trial.  The \nOrder specified the information required, and stated that the estimates could be provided in camera \nso as not to reveal trial strategy.  In many instances, parties chose to ignore the order and failed to \ndescribe the topic of expected testimony.  Therefore, these requests were discounted.  Defendant \nBilly R. Wilks chose to ignore the Courtโs order and failed to submit an estimate, so the Court must \nbase its decision on information provided by the other parties. \nIt is further ORDERED that Plaintiffs will be allowed 36 hours, whether used in direct \nexamination or cross examination.  Defendants Signal International, LLC, Signal International, \nInc., Signal International Texas, G.P., and Signal International Texas, L.P. (as a group) will be \nallowed 28 hours; Defendants Sachin Dewan and Dewan Consultants PVT.LTD (as a group) will \nbe allowed 8 hours; and Defendants Malvern C. Barnett, Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, \nA.P.C., and Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, LLC (as a group) will be allowed 8 hours, \nwhether used in direct examination or cross examination.  Plaintiffs and Defendants shall each \nhave 10 minutes for interim statements, to be used not for argument or summation, but to inform \nthe jury about anticipated testimony, or to direct the jury=s attention to the fact that a new topic is \n \n  Page 3 of  4 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 286   Filed 03/17/15   Page 4 of 4 PageID #:  8809\nabout to be discussed. For example, after covering invalidity contentions with an expert, counsel \nmight say something like: ALadies and Gentlemen, that completes Dr. Smith=s testimony about  \nthe invalidity of both patents (the necessary treatment of Plaintiff).   He will now discuss  Dr. \nHowardโs testimony about infringement of the โ109 patent (the reasonable and necessary costs of \nPlaintiffโs treatment)โ. \nA party may, at the conclusion of 80% of its allotted time, move for an extension of time.  \nSuch extension will only be granted for good cause shown, and such good cause shall include a \nshowing that the party=s past use of time and anticipated use of remaining and requested time does \nnot constitute undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence. \n \n \n  Page 4 of  4 ",

NO. 235) AND \nMOTION TO RE-DEPOSE THE PLAINTIFFS (DOC. NO. 242) \n \n  This case is assigned to the Honorable Ron Clark, Chief United States District Judge, and \nis referred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge for all pretrial matters pursuant to a \nReferral Order.  (Doc. No. 4.)  Pending before the undersigned are the following motions: \nโMotion for Rule 37 Sanctionsโ (Doc. No. 235), โMotion for Expedited Hearingโ (Doc. No. 243), \nand โMotion and Memorandum in Support to Redepose Plaintiffs on T-Visa Evidenceโ (Doc.

The Plaintiffs oppose Signalโs \nmotions.  (Doc. Nos. 251, 252.) \n  On October 15, 2014, the undersigned granted in part a motion to compel filed by Signal \nrequiring the Plaintiffs to produce their T-visas and visa applications within seven days.  (Doc. \nNo. 148.)  Signal seeks to have certain facts deemed established because it claims that the \nPlaintiffs did not produce these documents until March 4, 2015โover four months lateโand also \nrequests to re-depose each of the Plaintiffs for a half-day regarding these recently produced \ndocuments.  Because Signal did not diligently pursue these documents, and therefore, bears much \nof the responsibility for not having these documents during the Plaintiffsโ depositions and not \nreceiving them until March, the undersigned finds that Signal is not entitled to the relief that it \nseeks. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 2 of 14 PageID #:  8783\nI. Background \nA.  Factual Background \nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, approximately 590 men, including the seventeen \nPlaintiffs in this case, were allegedly trafficked into the United States to provide labor for Signalโs \noperations.  (Doc. No.  64, pp. 2โ4.)  The Plaintiffs claim  that the Defendants  made false \npromises of โpermanent work-based immigration to the United States,โ and that to take advantage \nof this promising opportunity, the Plaintiffs allegedly โplunged themselves and their families into \ndebt . . . to pay mandatory recruitment, immigration processing, and travel fees . . . .โ  (Id. at p. 2.)  \nAfter arriving at Signalโs facility in Orange, Texas, the Plaintiffs were allegedly subjected to \nserious  abuses,  threatened  with  deportation  if  they  left,  and  forced  to  live  in  substandard \nconditions.  In addition, the Plaintiffs assert that they could not leave their jobs with Signal due to \nthe large debts they incurred in their homeland. \nThe Plaintiffs allege that some or all of the Defendants violated the following federal \nstatutes: (1) the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003; (2) the Racketeer \nInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act; (3) the Civil Rights Act of 1866; and (4) the Ku Klux \nKlan Act of 1871.  (Id. at pp. 50โ68.)  In addition, the Plaintiffs assert causes of action for \nstate-law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract against all of the Defendants.  \n(Id.)   \nB.  Procedural History \n  On September 5, 2014, Signal filed a motion to compel.  (Doc. No. 127.)  Among other \nthings,  Signal  sought  the  Plaintiffsโ  T-visa  and  T-visa  applications.1   (Id.)    The  Plaintiffs \n                                                 \n1.  T-visas are visas that are available to victims of human trafficking, and allow a holder to stay in the \nUnited States for up to three years, and in some cases, may even lead to permanent residency.  See 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.11.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 3 of 14 PageID #:  8784\nopposed, arguing that requiring production of these documents โwould impart a very real in \nterrorem effect on Plaintiffs and others attempting to exercise their rights under federal trafficking \nand employment laws.โ  (Doc. No. 137, p. 1.)  On October 15, 2014, the undersigned issued an \norder granting in part Signalโs motion, and required that the Plaintiffs produce their T-visas and \nvisa applications within seven days of the order.  (Doc. No. 148, p. 21.)  Both parties objected, \nand requested a โclarificationโ from the district judge.  (Doc. No. 172) (the Plaintiffs requested \nthat โthe order should be clarified to prevent disclosure of highly sensitive, irrelevant materialsโ); \n(Doc. No. 188) (Signal โurge[d] [the] Court to modify the Order to clarify the relevant period of \ndiscoveryโ).  On February 24, 2015, the district court overruled both partiesโ objections and \nstated that any โclarificationsโ of the order on the motion to compel should be addressed to the \nundersigned.  (Doc. No. 228.)  The parties sought no further clarification. \n  Six days later, on March 2, 2015, Signal filed a motion for sanctions, arguing that the \nPlaintiffs had not yet produced the required information and that this delay has caused โsubstantial \nprejudice to Signalโs trial preparation.โ  (Doc. No. 235.)  Signal requests that nine โstatements be \ndeemed established for purposes of this litigationโ and its attorneysโ fees.  (Id.)  On March 4, \n2015, the Plaintiffs produced their T-visas and visa applications.  (Doc. No. 242, p. 3.)  Then, on \nMarch 6, 2015, Signal filed another motion, this time requesting to re-depose each of the Plaintiffs \nfor a half-day based on the recently produced documents.  (Id.)  The Plaintiffs oppose both of \nSignalโs motions.  (Doc. Nos. 251, 252.) \n \n \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 4 of 14 PageID #:  8785\nII. Analysis \nA.  Signalโs โMotion for Rule 37 Sanctionsโ (Doc. No. 235) \nWhether  to  impose  sanctions  is  within  the  discretion  of  the  court.    See  Haase  v. \nCountrywide Home Loans, Inc., 748 F.3d 624, 630โ31 (5th Cir. 2014).  Here, Signal requests to \nhave nine facts deemed established because the Plaintiffs failed to timely comply with the \nundersignedโs order on Signalโs motion to compel.  While one available sanction for failing to \ncomply with a discovery order is finding โthat the matters embraced in the order or other \ndesignated facts  be taken as established for the purposes of the action,โ such relief is  not \nappropriate here.  See FED. R. CIV. P. 37(b)(2)(A)(i).   \nThe undersignedโs order required that the Plaintiffs produce their T-visas and applications \nby October 22, 2014.  (Doc. No. 148, p. 21.)  Signal contacted the Plaintiffs on October 30, 2014 \nto inquire about the status of production because the Plaintiffs had not yet produced the required \ninformation.  (Doc. No. 242, Ex. A.)  On this same day, the Plaintiffs appealed the undersignedโs \norder and requested that the district court reverse the order, or alternatively, clarify certain aspects \nof the order.  (Doc. No. 172.)  Signalโs next correspondence regarding these documents was not \nuntil February 18, 2015.  (Doc. No. 235, Ex. A.)  \n It is entirely unclear why there was such a delay given that Signal apparently knew that โa \nRule  72(a)  motion  for reconsideration  does  not  automatically  stay  an  order.โ    (Id.)  (citing \nTempay, Inc. v. Biltres Staffing of Tampa Bay, L.L.C., 929 F. Supp. 2d 1255, 1260 (M.D. Fla. \n2013)).  Furthermore, based on the partiesโ objections, at the time of Signalโs correspondence, \nthere  was  some  disagreement  about  exactly  what  needed  to  be  produced.    Signalโs \ncorrespondence of February 18 began the dialogue, and the parties again conferred on February \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 5 of 14 PageID #:  8786\n23, at which time Signal โinsisted that Plaintiffs move . . . for a stay if production were to continue \nto be withheld.โ  (Doc. No. 252, p. 3.)  The Plaintiffs moved for a stay on February 24.  (Doc. \nNo. 227.)  That same day, the district court overruled both partiesโ objections (Doc. No. 228), \nwhich in turn mooted the Plaintiffsโ motion to stay.  (Doc. No. 234.)  The parties again conferred \non February 26, at which time it appears that the disagreements over the scope of what had to be \nproduced were resolved, and the Plaintiffs agreed to produce documents by March 2, and then on \nthe 2nd, requested a two-day extension.  (Doc. No. 252, p. 4.)  It is unclear whether Signal \nexpressly agreed to the March 2 deadline.  Given that Signal did not move for sanctions on \nFebruary 26, but rather, waited until the day Plaintiffs requested an additional two days, it appears \nthat Signal did not have too strong of an objection to the agreed upon March 2 deadline.  \nSignal argues that sanctions are warranted because the Plaintiffsโ delay in producing these \ndocuments has caused โsubstantial prejudice to Signalโs trial preparation.โ  (Doc. No. 235, p. 4.)  \nBased on the record, the undersigned is not persuaded.  At the outset, neither party is an innocent \nactor.  The undersignedโs order required that the Plaintiffs produce documents on October 22, \n2014.  The Plaintiffs did not move to stay their obligation until February 24, 2015.  (Doc. No.  \n227.)  Signal, however, also had an obligation to pursue its rights.  Signal sent one letter in \nOctober, and then waited several months before following-up.  If these documents are as critical \nto Signalโs defense as it asserts, Signal should have been more zealous in compelling their \nproduction.    While  Signal  faults  the  Plaintiffs  for  adopting  โa  legally  tenuous  position  in \nassuming that [the undersignedโs] Order was effectively stayed pending Judge Clarkโs review,โ \ngiven that Signal took no action for several months after the Plaintiffs appealed, it certainly \nappears that both parties treated their objections as having this effect.  (Doc. No. 235, p. 4.) \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 6 of 14 PageID #:  8787\nAccordingly, Signalโs argument that the Plaintiffs are the ones who bear the sole responsibility for \nthe late production of documents is incorrect.   \nMoreover, both parties requested a โclarificationโ of the undersignedโs order.  The district \ncourt put the onus back on the parties to work out their issues or re-brief them.  (Doc. No. 228.)  \nIt appears that the parties reached an agreement on their issues, and in doing so, agreed that the \nPlaintiffs could have until March 2, 2015, to produce these documents, and the Plaintiffs actually \nproduced them on March 4, 2015.  Therefore, based on the partiesโ conduct, the Plaintiffs were \ntwo days late in producing these documents to Signalโnot four months as Signal allegesโand \nsuch a delay does not warrant the imposition of sanctions.      \nFurthermore, Signal is overreaching in the facts it seeks to have established.  See Compaq \nComputer Corp. v. Ergonome Inc., 387 F.3d 403, 413 (5th Cir. 2004) (noting that any sanction \nโmust be specifically related to the particular โclaimโ which was at issue in the order to provide \ndiscoveryโ).  For example, Signal seeks to have deemed admitted that โeach plaintiff lied and \nexaggerated about material facts in applying for and obtaining his T-visaโ and that โ[n]either \nPlaintiffs nor their representatives believed that Plaintiffs could obtain T-visas without lying and \nexaggerating about material facts with respect to each Plaintiffsโ recruitment and work at Signal.โ  \n(Id. at p. 7.)  There is no basis in Signalโs motion to compel, their requests for production, or the \nundersignedโs order to have such facts admitted.  Signalโs request is so overreaching that it must \nbe denied.  Furthermore, given that the Plaintiffs have produced this information, it is better to \nhave the evidence presented to the jury regarding these matters as opposed to having certain key \nfacts established on account of being a few days late in producing documents.   \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 7 of 14 PageID #:  8788\n  The undersigned also finds that the award of attorneysโ fees in not justified.  If a party fails \nto  comply  with  a  courtโs  order  regarding  discovery,  an  award  of  attorneysโ  fees  may  be \nappropriate.  See FED. R. CIV. P. 37(b).  Rule 37(b)(2)(C) states: โInstead of or in addition to the \norders above, the court must order the disobedient party, the attorney advising the party, or both to \npay the reasonable expenses, including attorneyโs fees, caused by the failure, unless the failure was \nsubstantially  justified  or  other  circumstances  make  an  award  of  expenses  unjust.โ    The \nundersigned finds that there are โother circumstancesโ making the award of sanctions unjust.  \nBoth parties are to blame for the Plaintiffsโ untimely production of their T-visas.  The Plaintiffs \nhad no basis in law not to produce the documents, but Signal failed to zealously pursue them.  As \ndiscussed above, Signal sent one letter in October 2014, and took no further action until February \n2015.  Moreover, it appears that there was an agreement that the Plaintiffs could produce these \ndocuments on March 2, and when they requested an additional two days (which is insignificant \ngiven that Signal had already waited four months), Signal sought sanctions.  Had the Plaintiffs \nshown a pattern of seeking extensions or refusing to produce documents, then an award of \nattorneysโ fees might be appropriate, but that is not the case here.  The parties were fully \ncommunicating regarding these issues, and the Plaintiffsโ request of an additional two days is \nreasonable.  Therefore, the undersigned finds that โother circumstancesโ exist making the award \nof attorneysโ fees unjust.  \nB.  Signalโs โMotion and Memorandum in Support to Redepose Plaintiffs on T-visa Evidenceโ \n(Doc. No. 242) \n \n  Before the Plaintiffs filed this case, Signal was well aware that a contentious issue would \nbe the production of the Plaintiffsโ T-visas and visa applications.  The court in Davidโa parallel \ncase involving Signal and nearly identical allegations of human traffickingโtwice addressed the \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 8 of 14 PageID #:  8789\ndiscoverability of this information.  (Doc. No. 315, David v. Signal Intโl, L.L.C., 2:08-cv-1220 \n(E.D. La. Jan. 30, 2009)) (requesting that a protective order be issued); (Doc. No. 778, David v. \nSignal Intโl, L.L.C., 2:08-cv-1220 (E.D. La. July 22, 2010)) (moving to compel production of the \nplaintiffsโ T-visas).  Initially, the court entered a protective order that precluded all discovery into \nthe plaintiffsโ immigration status.  See David v. Signal Intโl, L.L.C., 257 F.R.D. 114, 125โ26 \n(E.D.  La.  2009)  (โ[T]his  Court  can  only  conclude  that  any  inquiry  into  plaintiffsโ  current \nimmigration status, current residence, and/or post-termination employment history will most \nassuredly strike paralyzing fear in the plaintiffs sufficient to chill any inclination they may have \nhad to prosecute their pending claims.โ).  A little over a year later, Signal moved to compel the \nproduction  of  the  plaintiffsโ  T-visas  and  applications.    Signalโs  motion  was  granted  in \npartโlargely because it appears that the David plaintiffs offered a compromiseโand the court \nordered  the  production  of  redacted  statements  that  were  attached  to  the  plaintiffsโ  T-visa \napplications.  Signalโs request for the actual visas and applications was denied.  (Doc. No. 854, \nDavid v. Signal Intโl, L.L.C., 2:08-cv-1220 (E.D. La. July 22, 2010)). \n  The Plaintiffs filed this action on May 25, 2013.  Therefore, from the moment that this \ncase was filed, Signal should have knownโor at least strongly suspectedโthat there would be an \nissue relative to the production of the Plaintiffsโ visas.  The first scheduling order required \ndiscovery to be completed by July 25, 2014, which was subsequently extended to October 17, \n2014.  (Doc. Nos. 61, 105, 122.)  Therefore, Signal had ample time to persuade this court that the \nPlaintiffs should be required to produce their T-visas and applications (an endeavor in which \nSignal was ultimately successful) before seeking to depose the Plaintiffs.   \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 9 of 14 PageID #:  8790\nSignal, however, did not immediately seek written discovery from the Plaintiffs.  Rather, \nSignal waited over a year to serve written discovery.2  On July 22, 2014, Signal received \nresponses  from  the  Plaintiffs  indicating  that  they  were  not  going  to  produce  visa  related \ninformation.  (Doc. No. 127, Ex. 2.)  Signal then waited over a month before filing its motion to \ncompel.  (Doc. No. 127.)  In other words, Signal was not particularly proactive (though they \ncomplied with the second amended scheduling order) in seeking this information.   \nWhat most persuasively demonstrates that Signalโs request to re-depose the Plaintiffs \nshould be denied is that Signal scheduledโand tookโthree of the Plaintiffsโ depositions before its \nmotion to compel was even ripe.  The first deposition was scheduled for September 19, 2014, and \nSignalโs motion to compel was not fully ripe until September 29, 2014.3  (Doc. No. 242, Ex. D) \n(Joy Varkeyโs deposition started on September 19, 2014); (Id., Ex. E) (Philip Babyโs deposition \nbegan on September 22, 2014); (Sojan Kaliyadanโs deposition began on September 26, 2014).  \nThe fact that Signal was willing to take several depositions before its motion to compel was \nripeโlet alone decidedโdemonstrates that Signal did not believe that having the Plaintiffsโ visas \nin-hand was as vital as it now argues.  Had Signal truly needed these documents to properly \ndepose the Plaintiffs, Signal should have served discovery earlier, which would have allowed it to \n                                                 \n2.  Assuming that the Plaintiffsโ responses were timely, and there is no indication in the record that they were \nnot, then Signalโs requests for production were served more than one year after the Plaintiffs filed this case.  See FED. \nR. CIV. P. 34(b)(2)(A) (requiring responses to requests for production be served within thirty days). \n \n3.  September 29, 2014 is the date that Signal filed its reply.  (Doc. No. 140.)  Arguably, the motion was \nripe after the Plaintiffs filed their response on September 22, 2014, which is still after the second deposition began.  \n(Doc. No. 137); LOCAL RULE CV-7(f) (โThe court need not wait for the reply or sur-reply before ruling on the \nmotion.โ).  Furthermore, it is unrealistic to believe that a court, dealing with the rather novel issue of whether the in \nterrorem effect can shield a party from having to produce immigration related documents in a human trafficking case, \nwill rule on the motion instantaneously.  Therefore, while some of the Plaintiffsโ depositions were taken before \nSignalโs motion was ripe, all of them were taken before the court could reasonably have been expected to issue an \norder.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 10 of 14 PageID #:  8791\nhave its motion to compel filed and decided before scheduling and taking these depositions.4  The \ngeneral rule is that a party may only take a witnessโs deposition once.  See FED. R. CIV. P. \n30(a)(2)(A)(ii) (noting that leave of court is required if โthe deponent has already been deposed in \nthe caseโ).  Therefore, because Signal decided to take the Plaintiffsโ depositions without these \ndocuments, it should have known that it would have no absolute right to re-depose the Plaintiffs.   \nIn addition, the undersigned agrees with the Plaintiffsโ assertion that Signal โhas pointed to \nno new information in the written T-visa materialsโ that warrants re-deposing the Plaintiffs.  \n(Doc. No. 251, p. 3); (see also id. at p. 9) (โSignal has not suggested, based on any of the \ndocuments produced relating to the T-Visas, how any testimony from the Plaintiffs might be \nnecessary.โ).  At best, Signal alleges that โthe testimony of the Plaintiffs could reveal additional \ninformation.โ  (Doc. No. 272, p. 2) (emphasis added).  Signal also references some additional \ncommunications that were part of the Plaintiffsโ visas, but fails to clearly articulate what it believes \nit could learn from these or why this justifies re-deposing the Plaintiffs.  (Id.)5  Furthermore, the \nundersigned finds some merit to the Plaintiffsโ contention that these depositions are aimed at \nharassing the Plaintiffs.  It should not take a half-day as Signal requests (or three and a half hours), \neven with translators, to discuss a handful of recently produced documents.  The only plausible \nexplanation for why Signal needs this much time is that it wants to delve into issues beyond what is \n                                                 \n4.  Signalโs reply highlights why it should have been more diligent in seeking written discovery.  Signal \nclaims that it needs to re-depose the Plaintiffs because their testimony โcould reveal additional discovery avenues \nunknown to Signal.โ  (Doc. No. 272, p. 2.)  It is reasonable to expect that discovery early in the case may lead to new \nissues, that is why the parties had a year to conduct discovery.  Signal, however, chose to wait until close to the end of \nthe discovery period to serve discovery.  To the extent there are โadditional discovery avenues,โ the time to explore \nthem has long passed. \n \n5.  Moreover, this is a new argument that was raised in a reply.  Therefore, to the extent that Signal is even \nclaiming that these newly discovered communications entitle it to re-depose the Plaintiffs, this argument is not \nproperly before the court.  Furthermore, Signal has provided no detail on what these โthird party affidavits and \ncommunicationsโ contain, and therefore, even if this argument were before the court, Signal has not provided the court \nwith enough information to intelligently decide whether this would warrant re-deposing the Plaintiffs.  \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 11 of 14 PageID #:  8792\ncontained in the Plaintiffsโ T-visas and visa applications.  Because Signal has failed to articulate \nwhat newly discovered information warrants re-deposing the Plaintiffs, coupled with the fact that \nSignal initially chose to take these depositions without having hard copies of the Plaintiffsโ T-visas \nand visa applications, the undersigned finds that Signalโs request to re-depose the Plaintiffs should \nbe denied. \nIt also appears that Signal is trying to challenge opposing counselโs instructions to the \nPlaintiffs not to answer certain questions during their depositions based on the in terrorem effect.  \n(Doc.  No.  242,  p.  4)  (arguing  that  โ[u]nequivocally,  the  record  indicates  that  the  parties \ncontemplated the possibility of redeposing the Plaintiffsโ).  This, however, is a different issue \nthan whether the recent production of documents requires re-deposing the Plaintiffs.  (Doc. No. \n242, p. 3) (โSignal was unable to question Plaintiffs on these highly relevant documents.โ); (Id. at \np. 7) (seeking to re-depose the Plaintiffs โon topics limited to T-visa applications and affidavitsโ); \n(Doc.  No.  242,  Ex.  B)  (โSignal  requests  consent  to  redepose  each  Plaintiff  on  the  T-visa \napplications and unredacted affidavits . . . .โ).  As an initial matter, the instruction not to answer \nwas likely improper given that there is no โprivilegeโ (as that term is understood in the Federal \nRules) related to the in terrorem effect, there was no protective order in place in this case (though \nthere were in other cases), and that the Plaintiffs did not move for a protective order until \nSeptember 22, 2014, which was the fourth day of depositions.  See  FED. R. CIV. P. 30(c)(2) (โA \nperson may instruct a deponent to not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to \nenforce a limitation ordered by the court, or to present a motion under Rule 30(d)(3).โ)   \nSignal, however, had options at the time of the depositions to address opposing counselโs \nobjections.  First, Signal could have insisted on getting answers to its questions, subject to the \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 12 of 14 PageID #:  8793\nobjections, and then allowed the court to rule on the objections.  Instead, there is no record of \nwhat questions Signal intended on asking because Signal agreed not to ask them.  Second, Signal \ncould have received an immediate ruling on this issue by calling the Districtโs discovery hotline.  \nSee LOCAL RULE CV-26(e).  The fact that a motion to compel was pending that contained some \noverlapping issues does not mean that parties could not have gotten an immediate ruling on the \npropriety of the Plaintiffsโ objections.  In other words, Signalโs motion to compel seeking certain \ndocuments did not necessarily preclude all questions relating to the Plaintiffsโ immigration status.    \nThird, if Signal believed that their questions were proper (or the instruction was improper), \nSignal should have moved much earlier to re-depose the Plaintiffs.  Instead, Signal waited five \nmonths to raise this issue.  It really appears that Signal is regretting not pushing harder to have the \nPlaintiffs answer its questions regarding their immigration status, and is using these recently \nproduced documents to open the door to a broad range of questions that it failed to get answers to \nthe first time they deposed the Plaintiffs.  However, whether Signal was able to question the \nPlaintiffs regarding certain documentsโwhich is the only real change in circumstance since the \ndepositionโis a different issue than whether Signal got all its questions at the depositions \nanswered.   \nAfter  considering  all  the  circumstances,  the  undersigned  finds  that  re-deposing  the \nPlaintiffs is not warranted.  If Signal truly believed that questioning the Plaintiffs on their T-visas \nand visa applications was so critical to its case, it could have taken steps earlier to ensure that it \ncould ask the questions it wanted.  Instead, Signal waited until late in the discovery period to \nserve  written  discovery,  waited  several  weeks  before  filing  a  motion  to  compel,  and  took \ndepositions with a motion pending.  It actually appears that Signal is regretting its failure to take \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 13 of 14 PageID #:  8794\naction on opposing counselโs instructions not to answer certain questions during depositions, and \nis using the recently produced documents as a way to re-ask its questions.  Signal, however, had \noptions at that time of the depositions to ensure that it received answers to its questions, or at the \nvery least, should have raised this issue earlier.  In the end, Signal now has the documents it \nsuccessfully sought through its motion to compel.  Signal is free to cross-examine any of the \nPlaintiffs on these documents at trial, subject to any ruling by Chief Judge Clark. \nIII. Conclusion \n  Signalโs argument that the โPlaintiffsโ own actions created a world where Defendants \nreceived long requested discovery on the eve of trialโ is an exaggeration.  (Doc. No. 242, p. 1.)  \nSignal bears much of the responsibility for any alleged prejudice it has suffered by receiving the \nPlaintiffsโ T-visas and visa applications just weeks before trial.  It should also be repeated that the \nPlaintiffsโ hands are not clean either because they failed to produce the documents as ordered by \nthe undersigned.  A ruling on a nondispositive motion by the undersigned should not be treated as \nan advisory opinion.  Sanctions, however, are not warranted because even though the Plaintiffs \nfailed to timely comply with the undersignedโs order on Signalโs motion to compel, Signal did not \nactively pursue its right to this information.  Moreover, the Plaintiffs produced their T-visas and \napplications March 4โjust two days after an agreed upon deadline.  As for re-deposing the \nPlaintiffs, Signal chose to depose the Plaintiffs knowing that it would not be able to question them \nregarding their T-visas and applications.  Therefore, they have no right to re-depose the Plaintiffs \nabout these documents at this time. \nAccordingly, Signalโs โMotion for Rule 37 Sanctionsโ (Doc. No. 235) and โMotion and \nMemorandum  in  Support  to  Redepose  Plaintiffs  on  T-visa  Evidenceโ  (Doc.  No.  242)  are \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 14 of 14 PageID #:  8795\nDENIED.  Furthermore, Signalโs โMotion for Expedited Hearingโ (Doc. No. 243) is DENIED \nAS MOOT.  \n  \nSIGNED this 17th day of March, 2015.\n__________________________________________________\nZaacckk HHaawwtthhoorrnn\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n14 \n ",

' \n  ' \nv.    '    1:13-CV-324 \n  ' \nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL L.L.C.,   ' \net al.  ' \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION DENYING DEFENDANT SIGNALโS MOTION \nTO DISMISS (DOC. NO. 70) \n \n  This case is assigned to the Honorable Ron Clark, United States District Judge, and is \nreferred to the undersigned United States magistrate judge to conduct all pretrial proceedings.  \n(Doc. No. 4.)  Before the undersigned magistrate judge is the โMotion of Signal Defendants to \nDismiss Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)โ filed by Defendants Signal International, L.L.C., \nSignal International, Inc., Signal International Texas, G.P., and Signal International Texas, L.P. \n(hereinafter collectively referred to as โSignalโ).  Because the Plaintiffs have pleaded enough \nfactual  content  to  draw  the  reasonable  inference  that  the  alleged  pendent  state  law  claims \noccurred in Texas, and this court cannot otherwise consider materials outside of the pleadings to \ndetermine the instant motion, Signalโs Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 70) should be denied. \nI.  Jurisdiction \nThe Plaintiffs are a group of skilled construction workers of Indian descent who were \nallegedly lured to the United States by Signal and a network of recruiters working on Signalโs \nbehalf.  In their second amended complaint, the Plaintiffs assert four causes of action pursuant to \nfederal  statutory  and  constitutional  law:  violations  of  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection \nReauthorization Act (18 U.S.C. ยง 1595); the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations \nAct (18 U.S.C. ยง 1962); the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. ยง 1981); the Ku Klux Klan Act \nof 1871 (42 U.S.C. ยง 1985) and the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 99   Filed 06/17/14   Page 2 of 7 PageID #:  2145\n(Doc. No. 64.)  For actions brought under federal statutory and constitutional provisions, the \ncourt has subject matter jurisdiction predicated upon federal question jurisdiction.  See 28 U.S.C. \nยง1331.  In their fifth and sixth causes of action, the Plaintiffs bring state law claims of fraud, \nnegligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract.  (Doc. No. 64.)   The court has supplemental \njurisdiction over the state law causes of action.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367.  Venue is proper in this \ncase because the events giving rise to the claims occurred within the confines of this district.  See \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1391.  \nII.  Rule 12(b)(6) Standard \nRule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes dismissal of a complaint \nthat fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6).  A Rule \n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss โis viewed with disfavor and is rarely granted.โ  Harrington v. State \nFarm Fire & Cas. Co., 563 F.3d 141, 147 (5th Cir. 2009).  When a court analyzes a Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion, it โaccepts โall well-pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light most favorable to the \nplaintiff.โโ  In re Katrina Beaches Litig., 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Martin K. \nEby Constr. Co. v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit, 369 F.3d 464, 467 (5th Cir. 2004)).  A court \nshould grant such a motion only when the complaint fails to contain โenough facts to state a \nclaim to relief that is plausible on its face.โ  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 \n(2007).  A claim is plausible on its face โwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the \ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.โ  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  โThreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of \naction, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.โ  Id. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 99   Filed 06/17/14   Page 3 of 7 PageID #:  2146\nIII.  Analysis \n  Signal moves to dismiss the Plaintiffsโ pendent state law claims of fraud,  negligent \nmisrepresentation, and breach of contract pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  \nSignal argues the claims alleged in the second amended complaint arise from facts that occurred \noutside the United States.  Consequently, Signal submits that the second amended complaint \ndoes not include enough facts to state a claim that is plausible on its face because the second \namended complaint is โextraterritorial with regards to common law claims on its face.โ  (Doc. \nNo. 70, p. 4.)  Furthermore, Signal alleges this court should make an โErie guessโ to conclude \nthe Texas Supreme Court would find โmore probably than notโ that the common law of Texas \ndoes not apply to state law claims โhaving so extraterritorial a basis.โ  (Id., p. 12.)  Signal also \nmoves to dismiss the complaint pro tanto1 to the degree the complaint seeks to recover the fees \npaid abroad with regard to the Plaintiffsโ claims under ยงยง 1981 and 1985.  (Id., p. 23.) \n  The Plaintiffs counter that their complaint adequately alleges facts that their state law \nclaims occurred in Texas and that Texas law applies to their claims.  Specifically, the Plaintiffs \nargue  the  complaint  makes  clear  that  the  tortious  actions  originated,  were  performed,  and \ncontinued to occur in Texas, specifically at the Texas Labor Camp located in Orange, Texas.  \n(Doc. No. 75.)  The Plaintiffs allege that while recruiters working on Signalโs behalf initially \nlured and defrauded the Plaintiffs abroad, Signal ratified the recruitersโ actions by continuing to \ndefraud the Plaintiffs upon their arrival in Texas.   Lastly, the Plaintiffs argue that a fact intensive \nchoice of law analysis is premature given the sufficient facts that plausibly support the events \ncentered around the Texas Labor Camp.  (Id., p. 9.)   \n                                                        \n  1.   Pro Tanto: To that extent; for so much; as far as it goes.  Blackโs Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009), \navailable at Westlaw BLACK. \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 99   Filed 06/17/14   Page 4 of 7 PageID #:  2147\n  1.  State Law Claims that are โExtraterritorial in Natureโ \nSignalโs argument that the complaint should be dismissed because the claims in question \nโarose from facts that occurred beyond the limits of American territoryโ is without merit.  (Doc. \nNo. 70, p. 4.).  The complaint is replete with allegations that Signal committed the state law torts \nin Texas.  The following is a summary of the Plaintiffsโ complaint (Doc. No. 64):   \nThe Plaintiffs were recruited by Signal and its recruiters, both in \nthe United States and abroad, to work at Signalโs Texas Labor \nCamp.  Signal and its recruiters contracted with the Plaintiffs to \nobtain permanent residence and immigration status in the United \nStates  within  eighteen  to  twenty-four  months.    The  Plaintiffs \naccepted Signalโs offer, paid their fees, and were transported to the \nTexas  Labor  Camp  in  the  United  States  to  perform  work  for \nSignal.  Once at the Texas Labor Camp, Signal ratified the actions \nof the recruiters, and breached its obligations and defrauded the \nPlaintiffs regarding their immigration status upon their arrival.  In \nthe Texas Labor Camp, Signal personnel held various meetings \nwith the Plaintiffs to discuss the status of the Plaintiffsโ visas and \ngreen  card  applications.    Signal  again  promised  the  same  visa \nextensions and green cards for the Plaintiffs as when they were \nrecruited  abroad.    However,  Signal  continued  to  breach  its \ncontracts with the Plaintiffs by failing to comply with their binding \npromises regarding permanent residence and immigration status. \nSignal and its recruiters knowingly or negligently made materially \nfalse  and  untrue  statements  and  representations  to  Plaintiffs \nregarding the nature and terms and conditions of applications and \nopportunities for immigration status and employment in the United \nStates.  Signal intended that the false statements made by Signal \nand its recruiters would induce Plaintiffs to pay them exorbitant \nfees and remain as Texas Labor Camp under deplorable conditions.   \n \nWhen deciding a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the court must consider these facts as true.  \nIn re Katrina Beaches Litig., 495 F.3d at 205.  From these allegations, the Plaintiffs have clearly \npleaded enough factual content to draw the reasonable inference that the alleged pendent state \nlaw claims of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract occurred in Texas.  \nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662 at 678.   Even if the complaint alleges Signalโs actions and the Plaintiffsโ \ninjuries occurred in Texas and India, Signal has not cited to any persuasive authority that this \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 99   Filed 06/17/14   Page 5 of 7 PageID #:  2148\nsubjects the Plaintiffsโ entire complaint to a 12(b)(6) dismissal.  In fact, district courts have the \npower to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over foreign law claims that form part of the same \ncase or controversy.  In re BP p.l.c. Sec. Litig., 843 F. Supp. 2d 712, 799 (S.D. Tex. 2012) (citing \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(c)). \n  2.  Pro Tanto Dismissal \nSecond, Signal moves to dismiss the complaint pro tanto to the degree the Plaintiffs seek \nto recover the fees paid abroad with regard to their claims under ยงยง 1981 and 1985.  Signal \nbegins with the premise that ยงยง 1981 and 1985 claims are not extraterritorial.  Signal would then \nlike the court to compare the complaint in this suit with 1) the first amended complaint2 in David \net al. v. Signal, Intโl, L.L.C. et. al. and 2) two sentences in the David courtโs order3 denying class \ncertification concerning what damages are attributable to the David plaintiffsโ discrimination \nclaims.  Signal argues this comparison would show that at least part of the Plaintiffsโ ยงยง 1981 \nand 1985 claims in this case occurred abroad.  Thus, Signal requests a pro tanto dismissal of the \ncomplaint โinsofar as [sic] concerns recovery, on the basis of the civil rights statutes, of fees paid \nabroad.โ  (Doc. No. 70, p. 22.) \n In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion,  a court  typically does not  look  beyond the \ncomplaint.    However,  a  court  may  consider  attachments  to  briefing  if  the  documents  are \nreferenced  in  the  complaint,  central  to  the  complaint,  referenced  by  the  parties,  and  their \nauthenticity is not in dispute.  See Walch v. Adjutant Gen. Depโt, 533 F.3d 289, 293โ94 (5th Cir. \n2008) (citing In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007)); Causey v. \nSewell Cadillac-Chevrolet, Inc., 394 F.3d 285, 288 (5th Cir. 2004).  While the David litigation \n                                                        \n2.  David v. Signal Intโl, L.L.C., Civ. A. No. 08-1220 (E.D. La.) (Doc. No. 47). \n \n3.  David et al. v. Signal, Intโl, L.L.C. et. al., Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247 (E.D. \nLa. Jan. 3, 2012). \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 99   Filed 06/17/14   Page 6 of 7 PageID #:  2149\nwas casually mentioned in the complaint, the David first amended complaint and the David \ncourtโs order denying class certification are not central to the Plaintiffsโ complaint in this case. \n(Doc. No 64.)  Furthermore, Signal failed to include the documents in its briefing to this court.  \nObviously, without being able to consider the David court documents, Signalโs motion should \nnot be granted on this basis.4   \nIV.  Recommendation \n  For the reasons stated above, the Defendantsโ Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 70) should be \ndenied. \nV.  Objections \n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(c) (Supp. IV 2011), each party to this action has the \nright to file objections to this report and recommendation.  Objections to this report must (1) be \nin writing, (2) specifically identify those findings or recommendations to which the party objects, \nand (3) be served and filed within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this \nreport.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(c); Fed R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2).  A party who objects to this report \nis entitled to a de novo determination by the United States District Judge of those proposed \nfindings and recommendations to which a specific objection is timely made.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง \n636(b)(1)(c); Fed R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3).   \n  A partyโs failure to file specific, written objections to the proposed findings of fact and \nconclusions of law contained in this report, within fourteen (14) days of being served with a copy \nof this report, bars that party from: (1) entitlement to de novo review by the United States \nDistrict Judge of the findings of fact and conclusions of law, see Rodriguez v. Bowen, 857 F.2d \n275, 276โ77 (5th Cir. 1988), and (2) appellate review, except on grounds of plain error, of any \n                                                        \n  4.  The undersigned is also more than confused as to how their requested reliefโdismissal of the \ncomplaint, โpro tanto, with regard to ยง 1981, for failure to state a claim, insofar as [sic] concerns the recovery, on \nthe basis of the civil rights statutes, of fees paid abroadโโcould be implemented in an intelligible order.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 99   Filed 06/17/14   Page 7 of 7 PageID #:  2150\nsuch findings of fact and conclusions of law accepted by the United States District Judge, see \nDouglass v.

(Doc. No. 4.)  Pending before the undersigned is a โMotion to Transfer Action \nPursuant to First Filed Ruleโ (Doc. No. 23), filed by Signal International Texas, G.P., Signal \nInternational Texas, L.P., Signal International, Inc., and Signal International, L.L.C. (โSignal \nDefendantsโ).

As a \nresult of this ruling, the Plaintiffs in the instant action filed suit in this District, where they were \nallegedly enslaved.  (Doc. No. 42 at 4.)  On May 21, 2013, the Plaintiffs filed their Original \nComplaint in this court.  (Doc. No. 1.)  Subsequently, they filed their First Amended Complaint \non August 1, 2013 (Doc. No. 19) and their Second Amended Complaint on December 19, 2013.  \n(Doc. No. 64.)  Currently, the Plaintiffs have filed suit against the following Defendants: Signal, \nMalvern C. Burnett, Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, L.L.C., Law Offices of Malvern C. \nBurnett, A.P.C., Indo-Amerisoft L.L.C., Kurella Rao, J&M Associates, Inc. of Mississippi, Billy \nR. Wilks, J&M Marine & Industrial, L.L.C., Global Resources, Inc., Michael Pol, Sachin Dewan, \nand Dewan Consultants PVT. LTD. (a/k/a Medtech Consultants).  (Doc. No. 64.)  The Plaintiffs \nallege that some or all of the Defendants violated the following federal statutes: 1) The Trafficking \nVictims  Protection  Reauthorization  Act  of  2003;  2)  Racketeer  Influenced  and  Corrupt \nOrganizations Act; 3) The Civil Rights act of 1866; and 4) The Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871.  (Id.)  \nIn addition, the Plaintiffs bring state law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract \nclaims against all of the Defendants.  (Doc. No. 64 at 65-68.)  On August 19, 2013, the Signal \nDefendants filed the pending Motion to Transfer Action Pursuant to First Filed Rule.  (Doc. No. \n23.)   \n                                                 \n  1.

Factual Background    \n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, approximately 590 men, including the Plaintiffs, \nwere allegedly trafficked into the United States through the federal governmentโs H-2B guest \nworker program to provide services to the Signal Defendants.  (Doc. No. 64 at 2.)  The Plaintiffs \nclaim that they were lured to work for Signal through the fraudulent promise of legal and \npermanent work-based immigration to the United States for themselves and their families.  (Id.)  \nSubsequently, after coming to the United States, the Plaintiffs were allegedly subjected to forced \nlabor and other serious abuses at Signal operations in Orange, Texas.  (Id. at 3.)   \nII.  Jurisdiction \n  The Plaintiffs seek recovery pursuant to several federal statutes.  For actions brought \nunder these statutory provisions, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon federal \nquestion jurisdiction.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331.  For the state law causes of action, the court has \nsubject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon supplemental jurisdiction.

While there are similarities in the two cases, the undersigned finds that \nthe two cases do not involve such substantially similar issues that one court should decide the \nsubject matter of both actions. \nA.  Parties \n  There is some overlap between the parties in David and the instant case, but it is not \nsubstantial.  While all of the Plaintiffs in the instant suit are also plaintiffs in David, as explained \nbelow, they are only asserting FLSA claims in David, which they do not assert here.2  (Doc. No. \n42 at 6.)  Conversely, none of the David plaintiffs asserting non-FLSA claims are parties in the \ninstant case.  The David defendants and the Defendants in this suit are not completely identical, \nbut for purposes of this analysis, the court agrees with Signal that the difference is insignificant.   \n(Doc. No. 23 at 12-17.)  While the first-to-file rule does not require identical parties, see Save \nPower Ltd., 121 F.3d at 950, โthe fact that the parties are different cuts against an argument for \nsubstantial overlap.โ  Jones, 2013 WL 3245957, at *4.   \nB.  Claims \n  While the first-to-file rule also does not require the issues to completely overlap, โthe cases \nshould be more than merely related to support a motion to transfer when venue is otherwise \nappropriate.โ  Buckalew v. Celanese, Ltd., CIV. A. No. G-05-315, 2005 WL 2266619, at *2 (S.D. \n                                                 \n2. Even if the Plaintiffs in this case were at one point putative class members in the David class action \nlitigation, they were never parties since the class was never certified.  See Smith v. Bayer Corp., 131 S. Ct. 2368, \n2379 (2011) (holding that it is erroneous to believe a nonnamed class member is a party to class action litigation before \nthe class is certified, or if certification is ultimately denied). \n \n \nPage 5 of 8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 74   Filed 02/11/14   Page 6 of 8 PageID #:  1841\nTex. Sept. 16, 2005).  The instant suit and David are related to the extent that all of the claims \nasserted in this suit are also asserted by the different David plaintiffs.  However, there is not \nsubstantial overlap among the claims in both suits.  As the District Court established in its opinion \ndenying the Plaintiffsโ Motion for Class Certification in David, each of the Plaintiffsโ claims \nrequire individualized proof as it pertains to that particular plaintiff.  David v. Signal Intโl, LLC, \nCiv. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. Jan. 3, 2012).  Thus, not \nonly are each of the individual plaintiffsโ forced labor, trafficking, RICO and civil rights claims \ndifferent from one another in this suit, as explained below, they are entirely different from their \npending FLSA claims in David.  Therefore, the issues presented by the Plaintiffs cannot be \nresolved in the David suit.  W. Gulf Mar. Assโn v. ILA Deep Sea Local 24, S. Atl. & Gulf Coast \nDist. of ILA, AFL-CIO, 751 F.2d 721, 729 (5th Cir. 1985). \n  1.  Forced Labor and Trafficking \n  The  success  of  each  Plaintiffโs  forced  labor  and  trafficking  claim  is  dependent  on \nindividualized factors.  The question in a forced labor case is โwhether Defendantsโ coercive \nconduct was such that it could overcome the will of the victim so as to make him render his labor \ninvoluntary.โ  David, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247 at 77.  โThis question cannot be answered \nvia  generalized  class-wide  proof  but  rather  must  be  answered  individually  based  upon \nindividualized proof.โ  Id.  Similarly, with trafficking, โindividual issues will play a significant \npartโ because involuntary servitude is an essential element of the claim.  Id. at 80-81.   \n \nPage 6 of 8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 74   Filed 02/11/14   Page 7 of 8 PageID #:  1842\n  2.  RICO Claims \n  The success of each Plaintiffโs RICO claim is also based on each individualโs experience \nbecause the Plaintiffs will be โrequired to prove that the [Defendants] committed the predicate acts \nupon which they rely for the pattern of racketeering activity.โ  Id. at 92.  As stated above, proof \nof the predicate acts of trafficking and forced labor are โall premised on coercionโ and โcannot be \nmade without resort to individualized proof.โ  Id.  Additionally, in order to prove the fraud-based \npredicate acts, each Plaintiff will โhave to prove first-party reliance on the alleged fraud that was \ndirected at them,โ because โthe question of individual reliance [is] paramount to resolving whether \nPlaintiffsโ injuries were caused by a RICO violation.โ  Id. at 105-06. \n  3.  Civil Rights Claims \n \n  The Plaintiffs also sue the Signal Defendants under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981 for violating their \nright to โenjoy and benefit from non-discriminatory employment relationshipsโ with the Signal \nDefendants.  (Doc. No. 64 at 63.)  In order to obtain compensatory damages under this claim, as \nsought by the Plaintiffs, each โPlaintiff must prove actual injury to himself and that injury must be \nattributable to (caused by) the Defendantโs disparate treatment.โ  David, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n114247, at *119.  For this reason, the outcome of each Plaintiffโs case will vary based on their \nindividualized experience.  \n  4.  Violations of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 \n  The Plaintiffs also allege that the Defendants violated the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1971 by \nviolating their right to be free from โforced labor, involuntary servitude, and trafficking in \npersons.โ  (Doc. No. 64 at 65.)  Forced labor, involuntary servitude, and trafficking all include an \n \nPage 7 of 8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 74   Filed 02/11/14   Page 8 of 8 PageID #:  1843\nelement of coercion, which requires an individualized analysis of each Plaintiffโs situation, as \nstated above.  David, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *128.   \n  As one can easily discern, none of the above causes of action involve substantially similar \nissues to the Plaintiffsโ FLSA claims pending in David, which include claims of violating the \nfederally mandated minimum wage laws.  The undersigned agrees with the Plaintiffs that the \nproof required for the FLSA claims and the remedies sought are distinct from the proof and \nremedies at issue in the instant matter.  Given that there is not a substantial overlap of the claims \nbetween the David litigation and this case, and with the exception of the Plaintiffsโ FLSA claims in \nDavid, none of the Plaintiffs in the instant suit and David overlap, the courtโs denial of the Signal \nDefendantsโ motion to transfer will not result in โpiecemeal resolution of issues that call for a \nuniform result.โ  Save Power Ltd. v. Syntek Fin. Corp., 121 F.3d 947, 950 (5th Cir. 1997).   \nV.  Conclusion \n  The undersigned finds that the instant suit does not substantially overlap with the first-filed \nsuit, David.  Accordingly, the Signal Defendantsโ Motion to Transfer Action Pursuant to First \nFiled Rule (Doc. No. 23) is DENIED. \nSIGNED this 11th day of February, 2014.\n__________________________________________________\nZaacckk HHaawwtthhoorrnn\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n \nPage 8 of 8 \n \n ",

In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Plaintiffs and sim ilarly situated \nworkers, a total of approximately 590 Indian men, were trafficked into the United States \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 2 of 72 PageID #:  2\nthrough the federal governm entโs H-2B gue stworker program  to provide labor and \nservices to Defendants Signal International  L.L.C., Signal International, Inc., Signal \nInternational Texas, L.P., Signal Interna tional Texas,  G.P. and their af filiates \n(collectively, โSignalโ).  Recruited to pe rform welding, pipefitt ing, and other marine \nfabrication work, Plaint iffs were subjected to forced la bor and other serious abuses at \nSignal operations in Orange, Texa s.  Some similarly situated workers were subjected to \nsimilar abuses at Signal operations in Pascagoula, Mississippi. \n2.  Plaintiffs bring this a ction to recover for damages inflicted by Defendant \nSignal and Signalโs recruiters and agents ope rating in India, the United Arab Emirates, \nand the United States.  Defendants have  exploited and defrauded Plaintiffs by \nfraudulently recruiting them to work in the United States and effectuating a broad scheme \nof psychological coercion, threats of serious ha rm and physical restraint, and threatened \nabuse of the legal process to maintain control over Plaintiffs. \n3.  Lured by Defendantsโ fraudulent promises of legal and perm anent work-\nbased imm igration to  the United  States  f or them selves and the ir f amilies, Plaintif fs \nplunged themselves and their fam ilies into debt to take advantage of these seem ingly \npromising opportunities.  Plaintiffs assum ed these debts to pay m andatory recruitment, \nimmigration processing, and travel fees  charged by Defendants totaling as m uch as \n$11,000 โ $25,000 per worker.  Trusting in the ve racity of the imm igration and wor k \nbenefits prom ised by Defendant s, Plaintiffs further reli nquished stable em ployment \nopportunities in India and as guestworkers in the Persian Gulf. \n4.  Defendantsโ main recruiting agent in  India and the United Arab Em irates \nheld Plaintiffsโ passports and visas and threat ened, coerced, and defrauded Plaintiffs into \nPage 2 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 3 of 72 PageID #:  3\npaying extraordinary fees for recruitm ent, immigration processing, and travel.  Several \nDefendants further caused Plaintiffs to believe that if they did not work for Signal under  \nthe auspices of te mporary, Signal-restricted H-2B guestworker visas, they would suffer  \nabuse or threatened abuse of  the legal process, phys ical restraint, a nd/or other serious \nharm. \n5.  The false promises, collection of exorbitant recruiting fees, and strong-arm \ntactics of Defendant Signal and/or its  agents were, upon infor mation and belief, \nauthorized by Defendant Signal, which, in any event, learned in detail of these facts at the \nlatest from the very f irst Indian H-2B workers who arrived  at Signalโs  facilities in the \nUnited States as early as October 2006.   Far from taking any corrective m easures, \nDefendant Signal ratified and perpetuated the  scheme by continuing to facilitate the \ntransportation of further waves of Indian H-2B workers, including Plaintiffs herein, from \nNovember 2006 through April 2007. \n6.  Upon Plaintiffsโ arrival in the Unite d States, Defendant Signal required \nthem to live in a guarded, overcrowded, and isolated labor camp.  Signal further deceived \nPlaintiffs regarding their visa status, threatened Plaintiffs with loss of immigration status \nand deportation, and generally perpetrated a  campaign of psychological abuse, coercion, \nand fraud designed to render P laintiffs afraid, intimidated, and unable to leave Signalโs \nemploy. \n7.  On March 9, 2007, Defendant Signal,  using private security guards, \nattempted to forcibly and unlawfully deport similarly situated workers Sabulal Vijayan \nand Jacob Joseph Kadakkarappally from the Pascagoula camp in retaliation for speaking \nout against discriminatory conditions in S ignalโs labor camp in Pascagoula, Mississippi \nPage 3 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 4 of 72 PageID #:  4\nand for seeking counsel to understand their le gal rights.  Signal sim ilarly attempted to \nforcibly and unlawfully deport sim ilarly situated workers Kuldeep Singh, Thanasekar \nChellappan, and Krishan Kumar. \n8.  Terrified by the threat  of imminent deportation  and the security guards  \npursuing him, Vijayan attempted suicide and had to be taken to a local hospital.  During \nthe sam e morning, Signal personnel and s ecurity guards succ essfully forced \nKadakkarappally, Chellappan, and Kum ar into a trailer under guard.  There, Signal \ndetained Kadakkarappally, Chellappan, and  Kumar for several hours without food or \nwater or bathroom facilities.  Amidst the chaos of the pre-dawn raid at the Pas cagoula \ncamp, Kuldeep Singh hid and escaped from the Signal labor camp. \n9.  Having heard of the events of Ma rch 9, 2007 through cell phone reports \nfrom similarly situated workers in Mississipp i, the Plaintiffs herein and others in the \nTexas camp reasonably feared that they woul d suffer serio us harm, physical restraint, \nand/or abuse of legal process if they were  to leave Signalโs em ploy.  Deeply indebted, \nfearful, isolated, disoriented, and u nfamiliar with their righ ts under Un ited States law, \nthese workers felt compelled to continue working for Signal. \n10.  Plaintiffs assert claims against Defendants arising from violations of their \nrights under the Victim s of Traffic king and Violence Protection Act (โTVPAโ); the \nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizatio ns Act (โRICOโ); the Civil Rights Act of \n1866 (42 U.S.C. ยง 1981); the Ku Klux Klan Ac t of 1871 (42 U.S.C. ยง 1985); and claims  \nfor damages arising from fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract.   \nPage 4 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v.

Defendant Kurella Rao (โRaoโ) is th e Chairman and Director of Indo-\nAmerisoft, L.L.C., and m aintains offices in the New Orleans, Louisiana m etropolitan \narea.  Rao has substantial business contacts in Texas.   \n76.  Defendant J & M Associates of Mississippi, Inc. (โJ & Mโ), a corporation \norganized under the laws of  Mississippi with substantial business contacts in Texas, was \nat all relevant times engaged in the business of recruiting and providing Indian laborers to \nUnited States com panies and selling opportu nities for United States immigration and  \nemployment to such laborers. \n77.  Defendant Billy R. Wilks (โWilksโ) was the founder and general manager \nof J & M and currently acts as a consultant  for the com pany.  W ilks has substantial \nbusiness contacts in Texas. W ilks is persona lly liable f or the cond uct of  J & M.   \nDiscovery in the case of David, et al. v. Signal, et al., United States District Court for the \nEastern District of Louisiana  (Civ. No. 08-1220 SM/DEK) (the โ David Litigationโ) has \nestablished that Wilks had full control and  decision-making authority over J & M such \nthat J & M and Wilks were alter egos of one another. \n78.  Wilks is the founder of J & M.  He  incorporated it in 1996.  The main \ncorporate office of J & M is W ilksโs home.  J & M, dur ing the tim e relevant to this \nlitigation, was entirely beholden  to Wilks for i ts business ac tivity.  Further, W ilks has \ntestified that during the time relevant to this litigation all of J & Mโs decisions and policy \nchanges would have to be approved by hi m.  He was the m ain decision-maker with \nregard to all of the companyโs relevant bus iness activity.  Both W ilks and his form er \nPage 16 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 17 of 72 PageID #:  17\nlawyer describe Wilks as the only person  who knows anything a bout the company and \nthat it is indeed his company, although in fact  Wilksโ sons participated in the conduct of \nthe company.  \n79.  At some point prior to 2007, J & M wa s sued in unrelated  litigation.  In \nresponse to that lawsuit, W ilks set up a  new corporation โ J &  M Marine & Industrial \nLLC (โJ & M Marineโ ) โ primarily to avoid the litigation then pending against J & M, \nbut also to continue the work that was underway with J & M.   \n80.  Wilks used the con tractual arrangements and relationships he had set up \nbetween J & M and the Recruiter Defendants  to create profitable opportunities for his \nnew J & M Marine entity.  In other words, Wilks harvested the value that remained in J & \nM and transferred it to J & M Marine with no regard to the independent corporate identity \nof J & M.  Such a trans ition is not reflective of the action of a corporate entity; rather, it \nindicates an action done for the convenience and singular strategy of the principal, Wilks.   \n81.  In 2007, Wilks put J & M into dorm ancy.  This purported change of \ncorporate status was, upon inform ation and belief, done without a ny formal shareholder \nvote or board member meeting.  Further, J  & M is undercapitalized; it has, according to \nWilks, approximately $300,000 in debt.  Further,  Wilks, in yet another indication of the \nabsence of corporate formalities between him and J & M, has represented to the Court in \nthe David Litigation that he intends to borrow money so that he is able to personally fund \nJ & Mโs legal defense. \n82.  J & M filed a โNotice to Dissolve/Revokeโ with the Mississippi Secretary \nof State on Septem ber 12, 2010, although  it rem ained in good standing through \nPage 17 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 18 of 72 PageID #:  18\nDecember 2012, accord ing to the Mississipp i Secretary of Stateโs Bu siness Services \nwebsite. \n83.  In short, there is no independence be tween Defendant Wilks and J & M.   \nJ & M was simply used as the corporate entity to facilitate Wilksโs personal business and \nthat of his family.  He testified during his deposition in the David Litigation that he did \neverything for the com pany.  Indeed, prior  to incorporating J &  M in 1996,  Wilks was \ndoing the exact sam e work, as the 100% owne r, under a โdoing/business/asโ rubric.   \nOnce Wilks incorporated J & M in 1996, there was no change to the company activity or \npurpose, and J & M certainly did not obtain an identity independent from its founder.        \n84.  Once Wilks created J & M Marine, he simply shifted his employee, Nicole \nHomel-Tellier, from J & M over to J & M Marine.  As he had done with J & M, he listed \nhimself as the registered agent and his home address as the companyโs principal address \nwith the Mississippi Secretary of State.   \n85.  Both J & M and J & M Marin e clearly share the sam e initials, which \nreference the same individuals: John and Michael Wilks.   \n86.  Both corporations perform the same work: rec ruit laborers to then sub-\ncontract them out to other com panies for a profit.  Given both entities were in the sa me \nbusiness and both operated out of the sam e address, it is likely that whatever assets were \nheld by J & M (e.g., computers, printers, etc.) were at the disposal of J & M Marine both \nduring the time that both  companies existed and also once J & M was put into dormancy.   \n87.  More importantly, with respect to the โassetโ crossover between the tw o \ncompanies, Defendant Wilks moved the laborers  โ plaintiffs and other similarly situated \nPage 18 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 19 of 72 PageID #:  19\nโ from J & M, with which they contracted,  over to J & M Marine.   In other words, the \nvery revenue source of J & M became the revenue for J & M Marine.   \n88.  In bringing the candidates over to J  & M Marine, after they had signed \ncontracts with J & M, Defendant Wilks was unequivocally holding J & M Marine out as \nthe successor company of J & M.  Further, this  transition of recruits, in conjunction with \navoiding the litigation then pending against J & M, exemplifies the taking of the benefits \nof the predecessor company while leaving its liabilities behind. Wilks acknowledges that \nJ & M has a $100,000 judgment against it, an obvious liability that has not tracked across \nto J & M Marine. \n89.  Throughout this Complaint, Plaintiffs refer to Defendants Indo-Amerisoft, \nRao, J & M, Wilks and J & M Marine collectively as the โLabor Broker Defendants.โ \n \nAll Defendants \n90.  At all relevant times, Defendants Dewan, Dewan Consultants, Pol, Global \nResources, Burnett, Bu rnett Law Offices an d GCILC acted as agen ts of Defendants \nSignal, J & M, Indo-Am erisoft and/or Ra o for the purposes of  recruiting, obtaining, \ncontracting, transportation and/or providing Plaintiffs for labor or services.  \n91.

Beginning in 2003 and continuing through 2006, Recruiter Defendants \n(Defendants Dewan, Dewan Consultan ts, Pol,  and Global Resources ) placed ad s in \nvarious newspapers across India and the United  Arab Emirates, seeking welders, fitters, \nand other m arine fabrication workers on beha lf of various U.S.-based com panies and \nindividuals, including L abor Broker Defendants (Defendant s Indo-Amerisoft, Rao, and \nJ & M). \n98.  Upon information and belief, Recruite r Defendants placed such ads in \ncoordination and agreem ent with Legal Faci litator Def endants (D efendants Burnett, \nGCILC, and Burnett Law Offices), and Labor Broker Defendants. \n99.  Upon information and belief, since  at least D ecember 2003 through at \nleast mid-2004, Legal Facilitator Defendants  and Labor Broker Defe ndants frequently \ncommunicated and consulted frequently  via m ail, fax, e-m ail and/or telephone \ncommunications to coordinate and direct  Recruiter Defendantsโ  activities, in cluding \nadvertising efforts on behalf of Labor Broker Defendants. \nPage 20 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v.

The advertisem ents placed by R ecruiter Defendants prom ised that \nqualified candidates could obtain legal perm anent residence (green cards) and  thereby \nlegally and permanently immigrate to the United States with their families. \n101.  In response to these advertisem ents, Plaintiffs contacted Recruiter \nDefendants by telephone, and/or attended m eetings and testing sess ions organized by \nRecruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator De fendants, and Labor  Broker Defendants and \ntheir agents, employees and/or representatives at several  locations throughout India and \nthe United Arab Emirates. \n102.

In these communications occurring during the first half of 2004, Recruiter \nDefendants and Legal Facilitator Defendants fu rther explained to many of the Plaintiffs, \nas reflected in the attached  Exhibit 1, that the installment payments would be divided \namong Recruiter Defendants and Legal Facilitator Defendants. \n106.  In these communications occurring during the first half of 2004, Recruiter \nDefendants, Labor Broker Defendants, an d Legal Facilitator Defendants further \nexplained to Plaintiffs that the installm ent payments would be divided am ong Recruiter \nDefendants, and one of the two Labor Broker Defendants. \n107.  In telephone communications, in-p erson m eetings, faxes, written \ncontracts, and/or other written communications, transmitted, upon information and belief, \nby mail and/or wire in the first half of  2004, Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator \nDefendants, and Labor Broker Defendants instruct ed Plaintiffs that the tota l fees would \nbe paid in a series of approximately three installments. \n108.

Based on these and other contractually -binding promises made to the m \nregarding green cards and work  opportunities in the United  States, Plaintiffs signed \ncontracts (hereinafter โthe green card cont ractsโ) at various tim es in early to m id-2004 \nwith Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and Labor Broker Defendants. \n113.  Contracts signed by Plaintiffs and  other docum ents provided to the \nPlaintiffs by Legal Facilitator Defendant s, Recruiter Defendants, and Labor Broker \nDefendants through the use of mail and/or wire transmissions in and around early to mid-\n2004, further promised that Plaintiffs would promptly receive a refund of all or nearly all \nPage 23 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 24 of 72 PageID #:  24\nof their paym ents if these Defendants di d n ot succeed in securing  green card s for \nPlaintiffs as promised. \n114.  Legal Facilitato r Def endants, Recr uiter Defendants, and Labor Broker \nDefendants knew or should have known that  they would not refund Plaintiffsโ m oney as \npromised in the contracts and other documents. \n115.  Legal Facilitato r Def endants, Recr uiter Defendants and Labor Broker \nDefendants induced the Plaintiffs to enter into the green card contracts:  (a) without intent \nto diligently pursue P laintiffsโ green card applications;  and (b) knowingly without any \nbasis whats oever f or r epresenting, inter a lia:  (i)  that th e com panies and/or en tities \npurportedly sponsoring Plaintiffsโ applications were financia lly solvent and had reliable \nand stable e mployment opportunities to pr ovide Plaintiffs; (ii)  that green card \napplications sponsored by su ch companies would be valid and bona fide under U.S. \nimmigration law; (iii) and that such applications were likely to be successfully completed \nand approved within the promised timelines. \n116.  In reasonable reliance on Legal F acilitator Defendants, Recruiter \nDefendants and Labor Broker De fendantsโ explicit and repeated prom ises regarding \ngreen cards, family membersโ ability to im migrate to the United States, and lawful and \nlegitimate em ployment opportunities in  the United States, Plaintiffs undertook \nconsiderable economic, social, familial and personal sacr ifices, including payment of \nhigh fees, assum ption of significant interest  bearing debt, loss of real and personal  \nproperty, lost work opportunities, lost or unpaid wages and additional legal fees. \nPage 24 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 25 of 72 PageID #:  25\n117.  Plaintiffs signed contracts with Recr uiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator \nDefendants, and/or Labor Br oker Defendants and m ade the  first round of installment \npayments required by these contracts. \n118.  After Plain tiffs signed   contracts with Recruiter Defendants, Legal \nFacilitator Defendants, and/or Labor Broker  Defendants and paid the first installm ent \npayments required by the contracts, these Defe ndants failed to provi de Plaintiffs with \nupdates regarding the progress of their green  card applications for extended periods of \ntime. \n119.  When Plaintiffs contacted Recru iter Def endants, Legal Facilita tor \nDefendants, and/or Labor Br oker Defendants by phone, m ail, and/or e-mail at various \ntimes between the last half of 2004 and m id-2006 to check on the progress of their green \ncard applications, these Defendants assured  them that the green card p rocess was going \nforward. \n120.  While awaiting the processing of their green cards, many of these \nPlaintiffs continued to incur substantial interest on the money they had borrowed for the \npurpose of making the first installment payment to these Defendants. \n121.  In or around January 2006, Recruite r Defendants, Legal Facilitator \nDefendants and Labor Broker D efendants,  personally and/or through their agents, \nemployees and/or representatives notified Pl aintiffs via telephone, e-m ail, and/or m ail \ncommunications that the labor certification required for their green card applications had \nbeen approved by the U.S. government. \nPage 25 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 26 of 72 PageID #:  26\n122.  After this notification, Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants \nand Labor Broker Defendants used wire a nd/or m ail communicatio ns to collec t the \nsecond and/or third installment payments from the Plaintiffs. \n123.  By spring 2006, after the 18 to 24 m onth processing period prom ised by \nRecruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator De fendants, and Labor  Broker Defendants had \nelapsed, the Plaintiffs had still not received their green cards. \n124.  By spring of 2006, Recruiter Defendant s, Legal Facilitator Defendants, \nand Labor Broker Defendants ha d yet to refund Plaintiffsโ paym ents as prom ised by \nPlaintiffsโ green card contracts. \n125.  In late May and early June of 2006, th e Legal Facilitator Defendants, on \nbehalf of Defendant Signal filed with  the Mississipp i Depart ment of Em ployment \nSecurity,  the Texas Workforce Commission, and the United States Department of Labor \nby m ail, electronic transm ission, and/or  fax the com pleted form s ETA 750 and \nattachments seeking permission to import a nd hire 590 foreign guestworkers under the \nauspices of 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b), attendant regulations 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.2(h)(6) \nand 20 C.F.R. ยง 655.3, and associated adm inistrative letters and/or guidance (commonly \nknown as โthe H-2B guestworker programโ). \n126.  Knowing that Signalโs labor need was projected to be at least two to three \nyears, the Legal Facilitator Defendants and Defendant Signal stated in these applications \nto the s tate workforce comm issions and fo rms ETA 7 50 that Si gnal would em ploy \nworkers from October 1, 2006 to July 31, 2007.  These applications were furnished with \nsignatures by Signal executives  swearing, under pain of perjur y, to the veracity of  the \ninformation in these applications. \nPage 26 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 27 of 72 PageID #:  27\n127.  Defendant Signal sought these workers to perform various jobs essential to \nits marine fabrication services business, including welding and fitting. \n128.  The H-2B guestworker program permits U.S. employers to import foreign \nworkers on short-term temporary visas to m eet labor needs when e mployers attest that \nthey cannot find U.S. workers to perform the available jobs. \n129.  H-2B visas are non-imm igrant visas,  are only valid for work with the \nspecific employer listed on the visa, and do  not provide portable and/or transferable \nemployment authorization for the visa bearer. \n130.  Defendant Signal stated in the ETA 750 for ms that its need for H-2B \nguestworkers was โpeak load and a one-tim e occurrenceโ and that โthe tem porary \nworkers will work f or the leng th of  the pres cribed da tes of  need, will be paid in  \naccordance with the prevailing wage, and will return to their home country at the end of \nemployment.โ \n131.  In the ET A 750 form s, De fendant Signal nam ed Legal Facilitator \nDefendants as its agents for the purposes of preparing and submitting these applications \nto import H-2B guestworkers.  Legal Facilitator Defendants prepared and submitted these \napplications on behalf of Signal.   \n132.  At the tim e of filing the ETA 750  forms and attachm ents with the \nMississippi Department of Employment Security, the Texas Workforce Commission, and \nthe United States Departm ent of Labor,  Defendant Signal and the L egal Facilitator \nDefendants knew that S ignal projected the labo r need that it sough t to fill with foreign \nworkers to be at least two to three years. \nPage 27 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 28 of 72 PageID #:  28\n133.  Defendant Signal and Legal Facilitator Defendants, at or around the time  \nthey filed the ETA 750 for ms in May  and June 2006, repeatedly comm unicated by \ntelephone, mail, e-mail, and/or fax to direct and coordinate recruitment of Indian workers \nto fill the anticipated H-2B guestworker jobs.  Upon information and belief, Signal and/or \nLegal Facilitator Defendants repeatedly communicated with Recruiter Defendants and \nLabor Broker Defendants by tele phone, mail, e-mail, and/or fax to direct and coordinate \nrecruitment of Indian workers to fill the anticipated H-2B guestworker jobs. \n134.  Upon information and belief, in the course of telephone, fax, e-mail and/or \nmail communications occurring in or ar ound May or June 2006, Defendant Signal \nauthorized Recruiter Defendants to  act as  their agents in India and the United Arab \nEmirates for the purposes of recruiting Indian welders and fitters to fill the anticipated H-\n2B guestworker jobs at Signal operations. \n135.  Upon inform ation and belief, in th e course of thes e communications , \nDefendant Signal further authorized Recr uiter Defendants and L egal Facilitator \nDefendants to represent that Signal would assume sponsorship of the pending and as-yet-\nunsuccessful green card applications on behalf of, among others, Plaintiffs. \n136.  Upon inform ation and belief, in th e course of thes e communications , \nDefendant Signal further authorized Recr uiter Defendants and L egal Facilitator \nDefendants to represent that Signal would ap ply for at least two to three H-2B visa \nextensions on behalf of all the Indian H-2B workers, including Plaintiffs, to allow them to \nremain in the United States working for Signal while Plain tiffsโ green card applications \nwere being processed. \nPage 28 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 29 of 72 PageID #:  29\n137.  Defendant Signal authorized its agents to make these representations even \nthough it knew or had reason to know that  such visa extensions and green card \napplications would not be bona fi de and  valid under United States immigration law.   \nMoreover, Defendant Signal authorized its agents to make these misrepresentations even \nthough it did not have the intention at that tim e to apply for such visa extensions and/or \ngreen cards on behalf of all of the Indian H-2B workers, including Plaintiffs. \n138.  In July and August of 2006, with specific dates and assertions as set out in \nEx. 1, the Legal Fac ilitator Defendants on behalf of Defendant Signal filed with the \nUnited States Citizenship and Imm igration  Service by m ail, electronic transm ission, \nand/or fax the completed I-129 forms and attachments seeking 590 H-2B visas.   \n139.  Knowing that Signalโs labor need was projected to be at least two to three \nyears, in these H-2B visa applications Defendant Signal attested to a 10-month labor need \nrunning from  October 1, 2006 โ  July 31, 2007.  Signal falsely represented to the \ngovernment that at the end of this 10 month period, it intended to return all H-2B workers \nback to India. The Legal Facilitator Defendants declared that the applications were based \non all information of which Defendant Burne tt had any knowledge despite the fact that  \nthe Lega l F acilitator Def endants b elieved th at Signalโs in tentions f or these  wor kers \nexceeded ten months. \n140.  In spring and summ er of 2006, Plainti ffs who had already initiated the  \ngreen card process spoke with Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and/or \nLabor Broker Defendants over the phone and  in person regarding  their long-pending \ngreen card applications. \nPage 29 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 30 of 72 PageID #:  30\n141.  In these comm unications, Recru iter Def endants, Leg al Facilitator \nDefendants, and/or Labor Broker Defendants offered Plaintiffs the opportunity to pursue \ntheir green cards under the sponsorship of Defendant Signal.  Plaintiffs were told that for \nan additional sum of approximately 35,000 to 45,000 rupees ($800 to $1,100), they could \nquickly obtain H-2B visas to go to the Unit ed States for work at Defendant Sig nalโs \noperations. \n142.  In these comm unications, Recru iter Def endants, Leg al Facilitator \nDefendants, and/or Labor Broker Defendants fa lsely assured Plaintiffs that Defendant \nSignal would seek at least tw o extensions of the tem porary H-2B visas with which \nPlaintiffs would gain  admittance to the Unite d States, and that Pla intiffsโ H-2B visas  \nwould thereafter be converted to permanent green cards. \n143.  Upon inform ation and belief, prio r to these communications with \nPlaintiffs, Recruiter Defendants, Legal F acilitator Defendants, and Defendant Signal \ncommunicated and consulted frequently  via m ail, fax, e-m ail and/or telephone \ncommunications regarding the issu es to be discussed and repr esentations to be made to \nPlaintiffs. \n144.  In the ir co mmunications with Plaint iffs, Recruiter Def endants, Legal \nFacilitator Defendants, and/or Labor Broker Defendants further failed to disclose material \nfacts regarding the H-2B visa, including the fact that H-2B visas confer only a temporary \nnon-immigrant status which does not allow the  bearer to adjust to perm anent residency \nstatus and the fact that applying for H-2B visa status is fundamentally incompatible with \nsimultaneously applying for a green card. \nPage 30 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 31 of 72 PageID #:  31\n145.  Plaintiffs, unaware of U.S. imm igration law and the tem porary, \nnonimmigrant character of H-2B visas and desp erate not to forfeit  the substantial fees \nthat they had already paid, agreed, in re liance on the repres entations of Rec ruiter \nDefendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and/ or Labor Broker Defendants, to transfer \ntheir green card applications to Def endant Signalโs sponsorship a nd further agre ed to \nwork for Defendant Signal under H-2B visas pursuant to the terms explained by Recruiter \nDefendants. \n146.  In reliance on the represen tations of Recruiter Defendants, Legal \nFacilitator Defendants, Labor Broker Defenda nts and Defendant Signal, Plaintiffs and \nothers similarly situated entered the  United  States on H-2B guestworker visas in late \n2006 and early 2007 for the purposes of working  for Defendant Signal at its Pascagoula, \nMississippi, or Orange, Texas f acility, and these Plaintiffs were assigned to the Orange, \nTexas facility. \n147.  Plaintiffs would not have paid the extraordinary fees charged by Recruiter \nDefendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, an d/or Labor B roker Defendants for travel, \ngreen cards, visas, and work opportunitie s had they known that these Defendantsโ \npromises and representations were false. \n148.  Plaintiffs would not have paid th e extrao rdinary fees cha rged by th e \nRecruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and/or Labor Brokers Defendants for \ntravel, green cards, visas,  and employm ent opportunities  had they known that these \nDefendants had failed to disclose m aterial facts concerning the nature and term s and \nconditions of the immigration and work opportunities offered. \nPage 31 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v.

At various times during the spring,  summer, and fall 2006, em ployees of \nDefendant Signal traveled to various locations in India and the United Arab Emirates and \ntested Plaintiffsโ welding and pipefitting skills in anticipation of employing them in the \nUnited States. \n150.  Plaintiffs paid costs necessary to travel to the cities where these tests were \nheld. \n151.  Plaintiffs paid admission fees charged to take these tests. \n152.  Plaintiffs attended and passed these tests, which were overseen and graded \nby Defendant Signalโs and/or Defendant  Dewanโs agents, em ployees, and/or \nrepresentatives. \n153.  Upon information and belief, prior to attending these meetings and testing \nsessions, Defendant Signal, Recruiter Defenda nts, and L egal Facilitator Defendants \nconferred in spring, summer, and fall 2006 by phone, mail, fax and or e-mail to organize, \nplan, and coordinate the logistics and substantive content of these testing sessions. \n154.  On or about July 20, 2006 and A ugust 17, 2006, the United S tates \nDepartment of Labor approved Signalโs la bor certification applications for 590 H-2B \nworkers for the period of October 1, 2006 through July 31, 2007. \n155.  In approv ing these lab or cer tification applications, the U nited States \nDepartment of Labor relied on the accuracy  of the applicationsโ stated 10-m onth period \nof labor need.   \nPage 32 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 33 of 72 PageID #:  33\n156.  On information and belief, the Depart ment of Labor is prohibited by its \ninternal guideline s to  grant labo r cer tification applica tions wit hout relying on the \napplicationโs statement of temporary labor need. \n157.  In late August and early Septem ber 2006, the United States Citizenship \nand Immigration Service approved Signalโs H-2B visa petitions for 590 H-2B workers for \nthe period of October 1, 2006 through July 31, 2007. \n158.  In approving these visa petitions, the United States Citizenship and \nImmigration Service relied on the accuracy of  the petitionsโ stated 10-month period of \nlabor need and the representa tion that Defendant Signalโs  need was based on a one tim e \npeak-load temporary demand.   \n159.  The United States Citizenship and Immigration Service must, according to \nregulation, rely on  the state d period of  the petition erโs la bor need,  see 8 \nC.F.R.214.2(h)(6)(ii)(B) (2006).   \n160.  Defendant Signal, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and Recruiter Defendants \nknew that the stated period of need in Signalโs applications for labor certifications and for \nH-2B visas were incons istent with Signalโs p rojected actual labor n eed and theref ore \nDefendants knew these statements to the government were false. \n161.  The Recruiter Defendants and the L egal Facilitator Defendants used the \nH-2B visas, obtained from  the U.S. Governm ent on the basis of false statem ents by \nDefendant Signal and the Legal Facilitator Defe ndants, to elicit payments of the second \nand/or third installment from Plaintiffs and other class members. \n162.  Plaintiffs entered the United States on H-2B guestworker visas, issued by \nthe U.S. Government on the basis of false st atements by Defendant Signal and the Legal \nPage 33 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 34 of 72 PageID #:  34\nFacilitator Defendants, in  late 2006 and early 2007 for th e purposes of working for \nDefendant Signal at its Orange, Texas facility. \n163.  Around the tim e of USCISโs visa appr oval, Plaintiffs made necessary \npreparations in ord er to travel to th e United States on H-2B visa s to work for Signal, \nincluding: paying to obtain necessary trav el and legal docum ents; making payments to \nthe United States consu late, Recruiter Defendants and Legal Facilitator Defendants for \nmandatory H-2B visa and consular processing  fees; attending H-2B visa interviews; and \npaying Recruiter Defendants for travel arrangements. \n164.  In order to secure H-2B visas to work  for Signal, Plaintiffs were required \nto be interviewed by United States Consular offices in Indian cities. \n165.  These consular in terviews necessitated that Plaintiffs pay the costs of  \ntravel from their hom es and/or current pla ces of e mployment to various large Indian \ncities including Chennai (Madras) and Mumbai (Bombay). \n166.  Recruiter Defendants and/or Legal  Facilitator Def endants, acting a s \nDefendant Signalโs agents, required that Plaintiffs meet with Recruiter Defendants and/or \nthe Legal F acilitator Defendants in these Indian  cities prior to attending their consular \ninterviews. \n167.  Upon information and belief, prior to these meetings Recruiter Defendants \nand Legal Facilitator Defendants discusse d amongst them selves and with Defendant \nSignal by e-mail, telephone, or in-person communications the topics to be discussed and \ninstructions to be given to Plaintiffs and others similarly situated at these meetings. \nPage 34 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 35 of 72 PageID #:  35\n168.  At these pre-in terview m eetings, Recruiter Defendants and Legal \nFacilitator Defendants ensured that Plaint iffs were up-to-date on paying the fee \ninstallments required by their green card contracts. \n169.  Defendants further required that P laintiffs pay an additional 35,000 to \n45,000 rupees ($800 to $1,100) fee for H-2B visa processing. \n170.  Recruiter Defendants and/or Legal  Facilitator Defendants required \nPlaintiffs to sign docu ments permitting Defendant Sachin Dewan to receive the ir visa-\nstamped passports from the Consulate on Plaintiffsโ behalves. \n171.  Recruiter Defendants and/or Legal Facilitator Defendants also coached the \nPlaintiffs on what to say and what not to  say during consular interviews.  Those \nDefendants, inter alia, told Plaintiffs not  to say anything about  the substantial fees \nPlaintiffs had been required to pay, not to st ay anything about expected green cards, and \nif asked to say that Plaintiffs expected to be in the United States for only several m onths \nand then would return to India.   \n172.  Recruiter Defendants and/or Legal Faci litator Defendants told Pla intiffs \nthat if they did not follow these instructions regarding the interviews, Plaintiffs would not \nreceive their visas and  would for feit the a ll m oneys they had previously paid to \nDefendants, in addition to losing their  opportunity to perm anently immigrate to the \nUnited States. \n173.  During Pla intiffsโ con sular inte rviews, the consular officials took \nPlaintiffsโ passports from them. \n174.  Once Plain tiffsโ visas  were app roved, consular offici als sen t th eir \npassports, with H-2B visas affixed, directly to Defendant Dewan. \nPage 35 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 36 of 72 PageID #:  36\n175.  After rec eiving word that Plain tiffsโ visas were approved, Recruiter \nDefendants made travel arrangements for Plaintiffsโ departures to the United States. \n176.  Before Plaintiffs could leave for th e United States,  however, Plaintiffs \nwere requ ired to atten d f inal m eetings  in Recruiter Defendant sโ Mumbai (Bombay) \noffice. \n177.  Such m eetings typically took p lace m ere hours before Plain tiffsโ \nscheduled d epartures to  the United  States, when Recruiter Defendantsโ office was  \nteeming with anxious fellow Indian workers awaiting departure to the United States. \n178.  At these m eetings, Recruiter Defe ndants collected final ins tallment \npayments required by Plaintiffsโ green card contracts. \n179.  Recruiter Defendants also required that  Plaintiffs, m ost of whom  do not \nproficiently read or speak English, sign English language documents with little or no time \nfor review. \n180.  Recruiter Defendants refused to return  Plaintiffsโ passports -- which had \nbeen in Defendant Sachin Dewanโs possession  since after Plaintiffsโ H-2B visas were \napproved by Consular Officials -- until after Plaintiffs had paid the final installments and \nsigned the mandatory paperwork. \n181.  In forceful tones, Recruiter Defe ndants or their staff dem anded that \nPlaintiffs quickly sign the m andatory documents, lest they miss the flights to the United \nStates which Recruiter Defendants had scheduled for them. \n182.  Without possession of their passports a nd within this rushed and hostile \natmosphere, Plaintiffs had no reasonable oppor tunity to review, negotiate, and/or m ake \nany changes to the documents presented them. \nPage 36 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 37 of 72 PageID #:  37\n183.  On occasions when workers who appeared at the Mumbai office failed to \npresent sufficient funds to pay the final inst allment required by the green card contracts, \nDefendant Dewan and his associates threatened  to destroy and/or deface these workersโ \npassports. \n184.  Such threats were uttered in the presence of other workers, causing thes e \nworkers to reasonably believe that they had no  choice but to pay the final installments in \nfull. \n185.  Based on the Recruiter Defendantsโ th reatening and coercive behavior \nduring these pre-departure m eetings in Mu mbai and the extrao rdinary and increasing \nlevels of debt they had incurred to pay  the Recruiter Defendants and L egal Facilitator \nDefendants for green card and H-2B visa arra ngements, Plaintiffs reasonably believed \nthat they had no choice but to m ake the payments required by the Recruiter Defendants \nand to travel to the United States to work for Defendant Signal. \n186.  Plaintiffs and approximately 560 other Indian H-2B workers traveled from \nMumbai to Defendant Signalโs operations in th e U.S. at various times from late October \n2006 to April 2007 on tickets arranged by the Recruiter Defendants. \n187.  Pursuant to Defendant Signalโs  instructions and arrangem ents, \napproximately 300 workers were sent to Sign alโs Pascagoula, Miss issippi facility and \napproximately 290 workers, including these P laintiffs, were sent to S ignalโs Orange, \nTexas facility upon arrival in the United Stat es, although Signalโs Orange, Texas facility \nbegan turning away workers in or around February 2007. \n188.  The Plaintiffs had no c hoice but to use the Recr uiter Defendants and the \nLegal Facilitator Defendants to secure employment at Defendant Signalโs operations. \nPage 37 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 38 of 72 PageID #:  38\n189.  The Plaintiffs had no choice but to pa y the fees the Recruiter Defendants \nand the Legal Facilitator Defendants charge d to secure e mployment at Defendant \nSignalโs operations. \n190.  Management personnel at Defendant  Signal m ade the conscious and \ndeliberate decision to prohibit the Plainti ffs from  securing e mployment at Signalโs \noperations either through anot her recruiter or by bypassing  recruitersโ altogether and \napplying directly with Defendant Signal.  \nConditions at the Signal Facility in Orange \n191.  Upon arrival at Defendant Signalโs  facilities in Orange, Plaintiffs wer e \nshocked to discover that they were expected to live in isolated, overcrowded labor camps \ncomprised of trailer-like bunkhouses.  W orkers who were sent  to Pascagoula face d \nsimilar conditions. \n192.  Defendant Signalโs labor cam ps were located in isolated, industrial areas \nmiles removed from shopping areas, places of worship, and residential communities.  The \ncamps were enclosed by fences and accessible only by a single guarded entrance. \n193.  The Signal labor cam p gates at the Te xas and Mississippi facilities were \nconstantly monitored by security guards retained by Defendant Signal.   \n194.  Signalโs security guards  monitored  Plaintiffsโ com ings and goings by \nrequiring them  to show th eir em ployee iden tification  badges and  record ing when \nPlaintiffs entered and exited the camps.  Signalโs security guards also searched Plaintiffsโ \npackages and bags when they entered the camp. \n195.  Except on rare occasions, Plaintiffs were not permitted to receive visitors \nin the Signal labor camps. \nPage 38 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 39 of 72 PageID #:  39\n196.  Up to twenty-four Indian m en were housed in each bunkhouse and m ade \nto sleep in two-tiered bunk beds.  The bun k beds were so tightly packed in the \nbunkhouses that it was difficult for workers to move about in the narrow passageways  \nbetween bunks.  These housing con ditions, inter alia, violated the applicable health  and \nsafety standards under the federal Occupational Health and Safety Act. \n197.  The Signal labor cam p bunkhouses had in sufficient toileting and bathing \nfacilities for twenty-four men, resulting in long lines for the bathroom s before and after \nwork shifts. \n198.  Privacy was non-existent, and Plain tiffs oft en experienced extrem e \ndifficulty sleeping due to the constant nois e resulting from the c lose quarters and th e \ncomings and goings of workers who worked on different shifts. \n199.  Defendant Signalโs personnel and/or s ecurity guards cond ucted surprise \nsearches of the dorm itory  areas of the bunkhouses, including searches of workersโ \npersonal belongings. \n200.  Plaintiffs took their m eals in Defendant Signalโs m ess halls, which were \nonly open during lim ited hours.  Due to  filthy and unhygienic kitchen conditions, \nPlaintiffs frequently became ill, sometimes requiring hospitalization. \n201.  Upon information and belief, Defendant Signal did not obtain the required \npermit(s) to furnish the board at its Texas  โman camp,โ and the condition and sanitation \nof the board further violated federal, state,  and/or local law including, inter alia, the U.S. \nFood and Drug Adm inistration Code, as adopted and  modified by Texas Food \nEstablishment Rules. \nPage 39 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 40 of 72 PageID #:  40\n202.  Defendant Signal deducted labor camp fees of a pproximately $35 per day \n($245 per week, or approximately $1,050 per month) from Plaintiffsโ paychecks for these \nsubstandard accommodations and meals. \n203.  When Plaintiffs com plained and as ked to live outside the labor cam ps, \nDefendant Signal initially refused and subsequently told workers that if they tried to live \noutside the camps Signal would still deduct the labor cam p fees from Plaintiffsโ wages.  \nAs a result, Plaintiffs reasonably felt that they had no choice but to continue living in the \nSignal camps. \n204.  Defendant Signal only housed Indian H- 2B workers such as Plaintiffs in \nits labor cam ps, which e mployees and m anagement at Signal referred to as the \nโreservation(s),โ in a derogatory play on  the common name (โIndianโ) for Plaintiffsโ  \nethnicity and Native A mericans.  Upon info rmation and belief, workers of non-Indian \ndescent and United States citizen employees were neither required nor allowed to live in \nand/or pay for accommodations in Defendant Signalโs labor camps. \n205.  Defendant Signal subjected Plaintiffs  to skills testing and re-testing, on-\nthe-job discipline, layoffs, periods without work, lack of safety precautions, unfavorable \njob assignments, evaluation processes, and ot her adverse employment actions to which \nnon-Indian and U.S. citizen workers were not similarly subjected. \n206.  In addition, Signal camp personnel a nd supervisors frequently subject \nPlaintiffs to an objectively hostile and abusiv e environment.  They ofte n used offensive \nlanguage in speaking with and/or referring to  Plaintiffs and other  Indian H-2B workers \nand regularly insulted Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers on the basis of their race, \nnational origin, and/or alienage. \nPage 40 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 41 of 72 PageID #:  41\n207.  During the first week of employing Plaintiffs and others similarly situated \nin the United States, Defendant Signal did no t reimburse Plaintiffs and others sim ilarly \nsituated for any of the expenses that Plaintiffs and others similarly situated were required \nto incur as a pre-condition of seeking employment with Signal. \n208.  During the first two weeks of e mploying Plaintiffs and others sim ilarly \nsituated in the United States, Defendan t Signal deducted approxim ately $100 to $200 \neach week from  Plaintiffsโ and other sim ilarly situated workersโ ch ecks for job-related \ntool kits which they were required to purchase from Defendant Signal. \n209.  Over the course of their em ployment at Defendant Signal, Plaintiffs and \nothers similarly situated were routinely  awarded a fifty cent per hour โsafety bonusโ for  \nworkweeks when they were not written up fo r violations of Defe ndant Signalโs safety \nrules.   \n210.  The safety bonus Defendant Signal paid the Plaintiffs and others similarly \nsituated was in addition to their regular hourly wage. \n211.  Upon information and belief, the safety bonus was non-discretionary w ith \nrespect both to the decision to pay the bonus and to the amount of the bonus. \n212.  Defendant Signal paid the safety bonus  to the Plaintiffs and others \nsimilarly situated pursu ant to a prior agreem ent or prom ise causing the Plaintiffs and \nothers similarly situated to expect the bonus payments regularly if they met the required \nsafety criteria. \n213.  During workweeks when the Plaintiffs  and others sim ilarly situated \nworked more than 40 hours, Defendant Sign al did not pay one and one-half tim es the \namount of the safety bonus for all overtime hours worked.  \nPage 41 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 42 of 72 PageID #:  42\n214.  Signal personnel and management regularly threatened Plaintiffs and other \nH-2B workers that if they did not continue working for Signal, or did not work according \nto Signalโs specifications, Plaintiffs and ot her Indian H-2B workers would be deported \nback to India. \n215.  In the isolated and guarded atm osphere of the labor cam p and grappling \nwith the crushing debts they had incurred to  com e to the United States, Pla intiffs \nreasonably felt that Signalโs s tatements were threa tening and f elt forced to con tinue \nworking for Signal despite terrible working and living conditions. \n216.  At regular meetings and in one-on-one or small group conversations with \nSignal camp personnel and management, some workers, including some of the Plaintiffs, \nvoiced complaints regarding the discriminatory treatment to which Indian H-2B workers \nwere subject.  Other sim ilarly situated wo rkers also voic ed com plaints, in bo th the \nOrange and Pascagoula camps.   \n217.  Workers Vijayan and Kadakkarappally, two of the plaintiffs in the David \nLitigation, took leading roles in gathering a nd voicing othersโ com plaints to Defendant \nSignalโs personnel in camp meetings in Pascagoula. \n218.  When Indian workers, including V ijayan and Kadakkarappally, voiced \ngrievances regarding housing, food, and wa ges, Defendant Signalโs personnel warned \nthem to stop complaining. \n219.  When Signal took no action in response to workersโ complaints, numerous \nIndian H-2 B workers living  at th e Pas cagoula labor camp,  including Vijayan and \nKadakkarappally, began m eeting collectively  to discuss how to persuade S ignal to \nPage 42 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 43 of 72 PageID #:  43\nimprove conditions in its labo r camps, and also began mee ting with third pa rties to \ndiscuss how best to address their concerns. \n220.  Defendant Signal becam e aware of th ese meetings, including m eetings \nbetween workers, including Vijayan and Kadakkarappally, and third parties whom Signal \nbelieved to be attorneys. \n221.  Defendant Signal, through its employ ees and/or agents, contacted the \nRecruiter Defendants and Legal F acilitator Defendants to express  its concerns about \nworker organizing efforts and the specific involvement of Vijayan and Kadakkarappally. \n222.  Upon inform ation and belief, duri ng these conversations Recruiter \nDefendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants,  and Signal reached an agreem ent regarding \nsteps that they would take to discourage further worker or ganizing efforts and to ensure \nthat the m ajority of the I ndian H-2B workforce continue d to work at Signal without \ncomplaint, as well as to prevent the Indian H-2B workforce from exercising their legal \nrights. \n223.  Upon information and belief, Signal m anagement and c amp personnel \nconferred and planned intern ally and with the private  Swetman security firm in \nMississippi to respond to workersโ organizing activities and to take actions to ensure that \nthe m ajority of the I ndian H-2B workforce continued to work at Signal without \ncomplaint, as well as to prevent the Indian H-2B workforce from exercising their legal \nrights. \n224.  On or about March 7, 2007, Defendan t Sachin Dewan called Vijayanโs  \nwife at her hom e in India and warned he r that Vijayan must  stop making trouble at \nSignal. \nPage 43 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 44 of 72 PageID #:  44\n225.  Vijayanโs wif e inf ormed Vijayan of  this call, and Vijayan ca lled \nDefendant Dewan on or about March 8, 2007.   During that conversation, Defendant \nDewan told Vijayan that Dewan had learne d from Defendant Signal that Vijayan wa s \norganizing the workers and m aking trouble.  De fendant Dewan told Vijayan that if the \norganizing continued, all the workers would be sent back to India. \n226.  Vijayan informed other Indian workers about the calls he and his wife had \nreceived from Defendant Dewan, and word  spread quickly through the Pascagoula and \nOrange camps and to these Plaintiffs, regarding the threats against Vijayan. \n227.  News about the calls between Defe ndant Dewan, Vijayan and Vijayanโs \nwife substantially heightened the reasonable fears of Plaintiffs in the Orange camp that if \nthey complained about or tried to leave the discrim inatory and substandard working and \nliving conditions at Signal, th e Recruiter Defendants, Legal  Facilitator Defendants, and \nSignal would retaliate  against Plaintiffs or  their families with ac ts of violence o r by \narranging for Plaintiffsโ deportation to India. \n228.  Defendant Signal called a  workforce-wide meeting on or about March 8, \n2007 in the Pascagoula camp, attended by Signal management and Defendant Burnett. \n229.  At this m eeting, Signal m anagement told the Pascagoula workers that \nSignal would fight back against organizing efforts by the workers. \n230.  Signal m anagement further threaten ed that Signal would not extend \nPlaintiffsโ and all other Indian H-2B worker sโ visas if any of the workers took legal \naction against Signal.  At that same meeting Defendant Burnett told the workers that they \nwere ineligible for other kinds of imm igration relief and could depend only on Signal to \nPage 44 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 45 of 72 PageID #:  45\nmaintain their H-2B immigration status and pursue their green card applications.  These \nthreats were promptly reported to the workers in Orange, including Plaintiffs. \n231.  At or about the sam e time as this  camp-wide meeting in Pascagoula, \nMississippi, Signal m anagement m ade the d ecision to term inate and forcibly deport \nVijayan and Kadakkarappally, along with Ku ldeep Singh, Kumar, and Chellappan, three \nPascagoula workers who are also plaintiffs in the David Litigation, and to do so by means \nthat would make an example of them for the other Indian workers in Pascagoula and in \nOrange, in order to keep those workers in line. \n232.  Early on the m orning of March 9,  2007, Signal locked  the gate to its \nPascagoula labor cam p, thereby  obstructing the sole m eans of direct entry to and exit \nfrom the camp. \n233.  Around this sam e ti me, Signal camp coordinator Darrell Snyder, and \napproximately five security guards, som e or all of whom were obtained through the \nprivate Swetm an Security firm , swept thr ough the bunkhouses ca rrying pictures of \nVijayan, Kadakkarappally, K. Singh, Kumar, and Chellappan. \n234.  Security guards began accosting worker s to determine whether they were \nthe individuals shown in the pictures. \n235.  Plaintiffs and other Indian H- 2B workers  at both  cam ps becam e \nincreasingly frightened and confused by thes e activities, particularly when word spr ead \nthat Signal had locked the gate that served  as the sole exit from  the Pascagoula labor \ncamp. \nPage 45 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 46 of 72 PageID #:  46\n236.  Around 5:15 AM that morning, Vijaya n was walking tow ards the dining \narea.  A security guard and Darrell Snyder,  a Signal employee, aggressively confronted \nVijayan and instructed him that he was in their custody. \n237.  Based on the threats made at the meeting on March 8, 2007 and Vijayanโs \nrecent phone call with Sachin Dewan, Vijayan feared what Defendant Signal m ight do to \nhim. \n238.  Vijayan began to panic, thinking of the enormous quantity of money he \nhad spent to come to the United States and th e massive debts he owed in India.  Vijayan \nknew that he would not be able to repay su ch debts if he were deported and no longer \nemployed by Signal. \n239.  These feelings, combined with Vijayanโs reasonable fear that Snyder and \nthe security guards might physically hurt him, drove Vijayan to attempt suicide.  Vijayan \nhad to b e transported from the labo r camp to a  local hospital for immediate m edical \nattention. \n240.  While attempting to assist Vijayan in obtaining m edical attention, \nKadakkarappally was grabbed by  Darrell Snyder and/or one or m ore of the security \nguards. \n241.  Kadakkarappally was taken forcefu lly by the arm  and m arched into a  \ncommunal room in the labor camp referred to by workers as โthe TV room.โ \n242.  Upon arriving in the TV room , Ka dakkarappally found two workers \nalready held inside.  Earlie r that morning, Darrell Snyder  and the secur ity guards had \ngrabbed Chellappan in the communal eating area and Kumar in his bunkhouse and forced \nPage 46 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 47 of 72 PageID #:  47\nboth of them into the TV room , where they  were kept under guard and prevented fro m \nleaving. \n243.  In the TV room , Darrell Snyder inf ormed Kadakkarappally that he and \nKumar and Chellappan were fire d and would be taken to the  airport to be deported to \nIndia. Snyder dem anded that Kadakkara ppally stay  inside th e TV room, and \nKadakkarappally was prevented from leaving the TV room by security guards.   \n244.  Kuldeep Singh, upon realizing Snyder  and the security  guards were \nlooking for him and intended to apprehend and de tain him, hid himself and later fled the \ncamp via an adjacent work area. \n245.  Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan were detained in the TV room, \nunder guard, from approximately 6 a.m. for several hours. \n246.  Several security guards watched  over Kadakkarappally, Kum ar, and \nChellappan while they were detained.  Over  the course of several hours, security guards \ndenied Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappanโs repeated requests to be let out of the \nTV room, to get something to drink, or to use the bathroom. \n247.  When Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappanโs co-workers attem pted \nto come into the TV room  to talk to the th ree workers kept inside, the security guards \npushed them back. \n248.  Confused a nd frightened, workers a ssembled outside the TV room to \nprotest the treatment of Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan. \n249.  At around  10 AM, Signal cam p personnel finally perm itted \nKadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan to u se the bathroom accompanied by security \nguards, one at a time. \nPage 47 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 48 of 72 PageID #:  48\n250.  Around noon, Darrell Snyder and a Pascagoula police officer entered the  \nTV room and the officer questioned why Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan were \nthere.   Snyder said that these workers had been fired and would be sent back to India. \n251.  By early afternoon on March 9, 2007, lo cal media, religious advocates, \nand other individuals had gath ered outside the cam p gate to express their concern over \nthe attempted suicide of Vijayan and the forced detention of Kadakkarappally, Kum ar, \nand Chellappan.   \n252.  Faced with  growing protes ts by  comm unity m embers and Signal  \nemployees, Defendant Signal decided not to  forcibly transport Kadakkarappally, Kumar, \nand Chellappan to the airport for deportation to India, and instead escorted them from the \nPascagoula labor camp. \n253.  Other Indian H-2B workers, including these Plaintiffs, working at Signalโs \nOrange facilities rapidly learned of the events at the Pascagoula labor camp on March 9, \n2007.  In response and out of f ear for th eir continued well-being, som e workers \nsurreptitiously fled both camps. \n254.  Within a few days of Plaintiffsโ and ot her Indian H-2B workersโ arrival at \nits labor camps in late 2006 and early 2007, Si gnal personnel had conducted meetings at \nthe labor camps between Plaintiffs and repres entatives from specific banks.  In Orange, \nthese meetings were with representatives from Capital One Bank. \n255.  At the instruction of Defendant Signal, Plaintiffs opened accounts with the \ndesignated bank and agreed to directly deposit their wages in these accounts.  Defendant \nSignalโs establishment of Plaintiffsโ accounts  with these banks gave it unique access to \nand control over Plaintiffsโ funds. \nPage 48 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 49 of 72 PageID #:  49\n256.  At some point before April 10, 2007, on information and belief, after some \nIndian H-2B workers had fled Signalโs Mi ssissippi camp, the bank with which those \nworkers had established sim ilar accounts denied those departed workers access to their \nbank accounts and invalidated their ATM cards.   \n257.  Upon information and belief, that Mi ssissippi bank refused the departed \nworkers access to their own bank accounts at Defendant Signalโs behest. \n258.  Indian H-2B workers s till working at Signal labor cam ps, including the \nPlaintiffs, heard about the difficulty departed Signal workers had in accessing their funds \nthrough Signal-established bank accounts and  reasonably believed that sim ilar action \nmight be taken against them should they try to leave Defendant Signalโs employ. \n259.  The information about workersโ inability to access their money, combined \nwith other factors described herein, contributed to the reasonable beliefs of Plaintiffs and \nthe other rem aining Indian H-2B workers th at if they tried to le ave the em ploy of \nDefendant Signal they would face serious harm  and/or threatened or actual abuse of the \nlegal process. \n260.  Defendant Signalโs actions on an d after March 9, 2007 significantly \nintensified the reasonable fears of the remaining Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers \nin the Pascagoula and Orange camps that if they tried to leave Signalโs employ or oppose \nunlawful and coercive em ployment conditions at Signal,  including by consulting with \ncounsel, they faced the threat of physical restraint, detention, forced deportation, or other \nserious harms and/or abuses of the legal process. \n261.  Throughout the spring and summer of 2007, Signal personnel in the \nMississippi and Texas cam ps held various m eetings with the rem aining Plaintiffs and \nPage 49 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 50 of 72 PageID #:  50\nother Indian H-2B wor kers to discuss the st atus of Plaintiffsโ a nd other Indian H-2B \nworkersโ visas and green card applications. \n262.  Upon inform ation and belief, during spring and summ er 2007 Signal \npersonnel conferred amongst themselves and with the Recruiter Defendants and the Legal \nFacilitator Defendants via phone and/or e-mail to reach agreement on what should be said \nto workers attending the meetings. \n263.  Soon after March 9, 2007, Defendant Signal held a camp-wide meeting in \nPascagoula.  Signal personnel to ld the Indian H-2B workers that Signal would sponsor \ntheir green cards if they stay ed at Signal and obeye d Signalโs rules, and warned that if  \nworkers held any m eetings against Signalโs in terests, they would be term inated.  As \nSignal understood would happen, workers at  the Orange cam p, including Plaintiffs, \npromptly learned what Signal personnel had said at this meeting, and understood it would \napply to workers at Orange, as well.   \n264.  In that same tim e period, Defenda nts Dewan and Burnett cam e to the \nSignal camp in Orange, Texas and again prom ised, in the presence of Signal personnel, \nthat Signal, through its attorn ey Defendant Burnett, would  make bona fide applications \nfor green cards and obtain several H-2B visa  extensions for the workers who had not  \nbeen terminated by Signal (plaintiffs in the  David Litigation, including David, Sulekha, \nThangamani, Kandhasamy, Khuttan, Andrews and Dhananjaya), and the other Indian H-\n2B workers.  Plaintiffs reasonably believed these promises. \n265.  In meetings and conversations in  spring and summ er 2007, Defendant \nSignal, through its agents and employees at  the Pascagoula and Orange facilities, \ncontinued to promise that Signal w ould arrange for the H-2B visa extensions and green \nPage 50 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324   Document 1    Filed 05/21/13   Page 51 of 72 PageID #:  51\ncards originally promised Plaintiffs when  they were rec ruited in India  and the U nited \nArab Emirates. \n266.  At the same time as Defendant Signal was promising to arrange for H-2B \nvisa extensions and green cards for the Plaint iffs as well as other Indian H-2B workers, \nSignal in fact was secretly evaluating all of the Indian workers with the intent not even to \napply for visa extensions for certain of the Indian H-2B workers. \n267.  Plaintiffsโ continuing dependence on  Defendant Signal for their present \nand future immigration status,  their continuing high levels of  indebtedness, as well as \nother factors reasonably led P laintiffs to f ear serious harm  and/or abuse of the legal \nprocess if they left Signalโs employ. \n268.  Under such circumstances, these Plaintiffs reasonably felt like they had no \nchoice but to continue working for Signal. \n269.  At various times relevant to Plaintiffsโ claims, Defendant Signal refused to \nconfirm whether valid H-2B vi sa extensions had in fact been obtained for Plaintiffs, \ncoercing Plaintiffs to continue working for Si gnal in the hope that Signal would finally \nresolve their uncertain immigration status. \n270.  Since first contracting with Defenda nts in India and the United Arab \nEmirates, Plaintiffs have yet to receive  from Defendants the green cards Defendants \npromised them .  Despi te clear co ntractual provisions requiring them to do so, the  \nRecruiter Defendants, the Legal Facilitator Defendants, and the Labor Broker Defendants \nhave refused to refund any of the moneys Plai ntiffs paid to them for unsuccessful green  \ncard and visa processing. \n   \nPage 51 of 72 \n \nComplaint - Joseph, et al.  v.

R ao h as \nsubstantial business contacts in Texas.   \n91.  Defendant J  &  M  A ssociates o f M ississippi,  Inc. ( โJ &  M โ), a co rporation \norganized under the laws of Mississippi with substantial business contacts in Texas, was at all \nrelevant times engaged in the business of recruiting and providing Indian laborers to United \nStates companies and selling opportunities for United States immigration and employment to \nsuch laborers. \n92.  Defendant Billy R. Wilks (โWilksโ) was the founder and general manager of J & \nM and currently acts as a consultant for the company.  Wilks has substantial business contacts in \nTexas. Wilks is personally liable for the conduct of J & M.  Discovery in the case of David, et al. \nv. Signal, et al., United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana (Civ. No. 08-\n1220 SM/DEK) (the โDavid Litigationโ) has established that Wilks had full control and decision-\nmaking authority over J & M such that J & M and Wilks were alter egos of one another. \n93.  Wilks is the founder of J & M.  He incorporated it in 1996.  The main corporate \noffice of J & M is Wilksโs home.  J & M, during the time relevant to this litigation, was entirely \nbeholden to Wilks for its business activity.   Further, Wilks has testified that during the time \nrelevant to this litigation all of J & Mโs decisions and policy changes would have to be approved \nby him.  He was the main decision-maker with regard to all of the companyโs relevant business \nactivity.  Both Wilks and his former lawyer describe Wilks as the only person who knows \nPage 18 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 208   Filed 12/23/14   Page 19 of 69 PageID #:  7442\nanything about the company and that it is indeed his company, although in fact Wilksโ sons \nparticipated in the conduct of the company.  \n94.  At some point prior to 2007, J & M was sued in unrelated litigation.  In response \nto that lawsuit, Wilks set up a  new corporation โ J & M Marine & Industrial LLC (โJ & M \nMarineโ) โ primarily to avoid the litigation then pending against J & M, but also to continue the \nwork that was underway with J & M.   \n95.  Wilks used the contractual arrangements and relationships he had set up between \nJ & M and the Recruiter Defendants to create profitable opportunities for his new J & M Marine \nentity.  In other words, Wilks harvested the value that remained in J & M and transferred it to J \n& M Marine with no regard to the independent corporate identity of J & M.  Such a transition is \nnot reflective of the action of a corporate entity; rather, it indicates an action done for the \nconvenience and singular strategy of the principal, Wilks.   \n96.  In 2007, W ilks put J & M into dormancy.  T his purported change of corporate \nstatus was, upon i nformation and belief, done without any formal shareholder vote or board \nmember meeting.  Further, J & M is undercapitalized; it has, according to Wilks, approximately \n$300,000 i n de bt.  F urther, W ilks, i n  yet a nother i ndication of  t he  absence of  c orporate \nformalities between him and J & M, has represented to the Court in the David Litigation that he \nintends to borrow money so that he is able to personally fund J & Mโs legal defense. \n97.  J & M filed a โNotice to Dissolve/Revokeโ with the Mississippi Secretary of State \non S eptember 12, 2010, a lthough i t r emained i n g ood s tanding t hrough D ecember 2012, \naccording to the Mississippi Secretary of Stateโs Business Services website. \n98.  In short, there is no independence between Defendant Wilks and J & M.  J & M \nwas simply used as the corporate entity to facilitate Wilksโs personal business and that of his \nPage 19 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 208   Filed 12/23/14   Page 20 of 69 PageID #:  7443\nfamily.  He testified during his deposition in the David Litigation that he did everything for the \ncompany.  Indeed, prior to incorporating J & M in 1996, Wilks was doing the exact same work, \nas the 100% owner, under a โdoing/business/asโ rubric.  O nce Wilks incorporated J & M in \n1996, there was no c hange to the company activity or purpose, and J & M certainly did not \nobtain an identity independent from its founder.        \n99.  Once W ilks cr eated J  & M  M arine, h e s imply s hifted h is em ployee, N icole \nHomel-Tellier, from J & M over to J & M Marine.  As he had done with J & M, he listed himself \nas t he registered a gent  and hi s hom e address  as t he companyโs principal address with t he \nMississippi Secretary of State.   \n100.  Both J & M and J & M Marine clearly share the same initials, which reference the \nsame individuals: John and Michael Wilks.   \n101.  Both corporations perform the same work: recruit laborers to then sub-contract \nthem out to other companies for a profit.  Given both entities were in the same business and both \noperated out of the same address, it is likely that whatever assets were held by J & M (e.g., \ncomputers, printers, etc.) were at the disposal of J & M Marine both during the time that both  \ncompanies existed and also once J & M was put into dormancy.   \n102.  More i mportantly, w ith r espect t o t he โ assetโ c rossover be tween t he t wo \ncompanies, Defendant Wilks moved the laborers โ plaintiffs and other similarly situated โ from J \n& M, with which they contracted, over to J & M Marine.   In other words, the very revenue \nsource of J & M became the revenue for J & M Marine.   \n103.  In bringing the candidates over to J & M Marine, after they had signed contracts \nwith J & M, Defendant Wilks was unequivocally holding J & M Marine out as the successor \ncompany of J & M.  Further, this transition of recruits, in conjunction with avoiding the litigation \nPage 20 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 208   Filed 12/23/14   Page 21 of 69 PageID #:  7444\nthen pending against J & M, exemplifies the taking of the benefits of the predecessor company \nwhile leaving its liabilities behind. Wilks acknowledges that J & M has a $100,000 j udgment \nagainst it, an obvious liability that has not tracked across to J & M Marine. \n104.  Throughout this Complaint, Plaintiffs refer to Defendants Indo-Amerisoft, Rao, J \n& M, Wilks and J & M Marine collectively as the โLabor Broker Defendants.โ \nAll Defendants \n105.  At a ll r elevant t imes,  Defendants D ewan,  Dewan C onsultants, P ol,  Global \nResources, Burnett, Burnett Law Offices and GCILC acted as agents of Defendants Signal, J & \nM, I ndo-Amerisoft a nd/or R ao f or t he pur poses of  r ecruiting, o btaining, c ontracting, \ntransportation and/or providing Plaintiffs for labor or services.  \n106.

Upon information and belief, since at least December 2003 through at least mid-\n2004, Legal Facilitator Defendants and Labor Broker Defendants frequently communicated and \nconsulted frequently via mail, fax, e-mail and/or telephone communications to coordinate and \ndirect Recruiter Defendantsโ activities, including advertising efforts on behalf of Labor Broker \nDefendants. \n115.

In telephone communications, in-person meetings, faxes, written contracts, and/or \nother written communications, transmitted, upon information and belief, by mail and/or wire in \nthe first half of 2004, Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and Labor Broker \nDefendants instructed Plaintiffs that the total fees would be paid in a series of approximately \nthree installments. \n123.

In such communications with Plaintiffs, Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator \nDefendants, and Labor Broker Defendants further promised to act diligently and do everything \nnecessary to obtain green cards for Plaintiffs in the timelines stipulated. \n127.  Based on these and other contractually-binding promises made to them regarding \ngreen cards and work opportunities in the United States, Plaintiffs signed contracts (hereinafter \nโthe green card contractsโ) at various times in early to mid-2004 with Recruiter Defendants, \nLegal Facilitator Defendants, and Labor Broker Defendants. \n128.  Contracts signed by Plaintiffs and other documents provided to the Plaintiffs by \nLegal Facilitator Defendants, Recruiter Defendants, and Labor Broker Defendants through the \nuse of mail and/or wire transmissions in and around early to mid-2004, further promised that \nPlaintiffs w ould pr omptly  receive a  r efund of  a ll or  ne arly  all of  t heir pa yments i f t hese \nDefendants did not succeed in securing green cards for Plaintiffs as promised. \n129.

In reasonable reliance on Legal Facilitator Defendants, Recruiter Defendants and \nLabor B roker D efendantsโ e xplicit a nd r epeated pr omises r egarding g reen c ards, f amily \nmembersโ ability to immigrate to the United States, and lawful and legitimate employment \nopportunities in the United States, Plaintiffs undertook considerable economic, social, familial \nand pe rsonal s acrifices, i ncluding pa yment of  hi gh f ees, a ssumption  of s ignificant i nterest \nbearing debt, loss of real and personal property, lost work opportunities, lost or unpaid wages \nand additional legal fees. \n132.  Plaintiffs s igned c ontracts w ith R ecruiter  Defendants,  Legal F acilitator \nDefendants, and/or Labor Broker Defendants and made the first round of installment payments \nrequired by these contracts. \n133.  After P laintiffs s igned  contracts w ith R ecruiter D efendants,  Legal  Facilitator \nDefendants, and/or Labor Broker Defendants and paid the first installment payments required by \nthe contracts, these Defendants failed to provide Plaintiffs with updates regarding the progress of \ntheir green card applications for extended periods of time. \n134.  When Plaintiffs contacted Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, \nand/or Labor Broker Defendants by phone, mail, and/or e-mail at various times between the last \nhalf of 2004  and mid-2006 to check on the progress of their green card applications, these \nDefendants assured them that the green card process was going forward. \n135.  While a waiting th e p rocessing o f th eir  green c ards, ma ny o f th ese P laintiffs \ncontinued to incur substantial interest on t he money they had borrowed for the purpose of \nmaking the first installment payment to these Defendants. \n136.

After this notification, Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants and \nLabor Broker Defendants used wire and/or mail communications to collect the second and/or \nthird installment payments from the Plaintiffs. \n138.  By spring 2006, after the 18 to 24 month processing period promised by Recruiter \nDefendants,  Legal F acilitator D efendants, an d  Labor  Broker  Defendants h ad el apsed, t he \nPlaintiffs had still not received their green cards. \n139.  By spring of 2006, Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and Labor \nBroker Defendants had yet to refund Plaintiffsโ payments as promised by Plaintiffsโ green card \ncontracts. \n140.  In late May and early June of 2006, the Legal Facilitator Defendants, on behalf of \nDefendant Signal filed with the Mississippi Department of Employment Security,  the Texas \nWorkforce C ommission, a nd t he U nited S tates D epartment of   Labor b y m ail, e lectronic \ntransmission, and/or fax the completed forms ETA 750 and attachments seeking permission to \nimport and hire 590 foreign guestworkers under the auspices of 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b), \nattendant regulations 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.2(h)(6) and 20 C.F.R. ยง 655.3, and associated administrative \nletters and/or guidance (commonly known as โthe H-2B guestworker programโ). \n141.  Knowing that Signalโs labor need was projected to be at least two to three years, \nthe Legal Facilitator Defendants and Defendant Signal stated in these applications to the state \nworkforce commissions and forms ETA 750 that Signal would employ workers from October 1, \nPage 27 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v.

These applications were furnished with signatures by Signal executives \nswearing, under pain of perjury, to the veracity of the information in these applications. \n142.  Defendant Signal sought these workers to perform various jobs essential to its \nmarine fabrication services business, including welding and fitting. \n143.  The H -2B  guestworker pr ogram pe rmits U .S. e mployers t o i mport  foreign \nworkers on s hort-term temporary visas to meet labor needs when employers attest that they \ncannot find U.S. workers to perform the available jobs. \n144.  H-2B visas are non-immigrant visas, are only valid for work with the specific \nemployer l isted on  t he vi sa, a nd do not  p rovide por table a nd/or t ransferable e mployment \nauthorization for the visa bearer. \n145.

Legal Facilitator Defendants prepared and submitted these applications on behalf \nof Signal.   \n147.  At the time of filing the ETA 750 forms and attachments with the Mississippi \nDepartment of Employment Security, the Texas Workforce Commission, and the United States \nDepartment of Labor, Defendant Signal and the Legal Facilitator Defendants knew that Signal \nprojected the labor need that it sought to fill with foreign workers to be at least two to three \nyears. \nPage 28 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v.

Defendant Signal and Legal Facilitator Defendants, at or around the time they \nfiled the ETA 750 forms in May and June 2006, repeatedly communicated by telephone, mail, e-\nmail, and/or fax to direct and coordinate recruitment of Indian workers to fill the anticipated H-\n2B guestworker jobs.  Upon information and belief, Signal and/or Legal Facilitator Defendants \nrepeatedly communicated with Recruiter Defendants and Labor Broker Defendants by telephone, \nmail, e -mail, a nd/or f ax t o di rect a nd c oordinate r ecruitment of   Indian w orkers t o f ill t he \nanticipated H-2B guestworker jobs. \n149.

Upon information and belief, in the course of these communications, Defendant \nSignal further authorized Recruiter Defendants and Legal Facilitator Defendants to represent that \nSignal would assume sponsorship of the pending and as-yet-unsuccessful green card applications \non behalf of, among others, Plaintiffs. \n151.  Upon information and belief, in the course of these communications, Defendant \nSignal further authorized Recruiter Defendants and Legal Facilitator Defendants to represent that \nSignal would apply for at least two to three H-2B visa extensions on behalf of all the Indian H-\n2B workers, including Plaintiffs, to allow them to remain in the United States working for Signal \nwhile Plaintiffsโ green card applications were being processed. \n152.  Defendant Signal authorized its agents to make these representations even though \nit knew or had reason to know that such visa extensions and green card applications would not be \nPage 29 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v.

M oreover, D efendant S ignal \nauthorized its agents to make these misrepresentations even though it did not have the intention \nat that time to apply for such visa extensions and/or green cards on behalf of all of the Indian H-\n2B workers, including Plaintiffs. \n153.  In July and August of 2006, with specific dates and assertions as set out in Ex. 1, \nthe Legal Facilitator Defendants on be half of Defendant Signal filed with the United States \nCitizenship and Immigration Service by mail, electronic transmission, and/or fax the completed \nI-129 forms and attachments seeking 590 H-2B visas.   \n154.  Knowing that Signalโs labor need was projected to be at least two to three years, \nin these H-2B visa applications Defendant Signal attested to a 10-month labor need running from \nOctober 1, 2006 โ July 31, 2007.  Signal falsely represented to the government that at the end of \nthis 10 month period, it intended to return all H-2B workers back to India. The Legal Facilitator \nDefendants declared that the applications were based on a ll information of which Defendant \nBurnett had any knowledge despite the fact that the Legal Facilitator Defendants believed that \nSignalโs intentions for these workers exceeded ten months. \n155.  In spring and summer of 2006, Plaintiffs who had already initiated the green card \nprocess spoke with Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and/or Labor Broker \nDefendants over the phone and in person regarding their long-pending green card applications. \n156.  In t hese co mmunications, R ecruiter D efendants,  Legal F acilitator D efendants, \nand/or Labor Broker Defendants offered Plaintiffs the opportunity to pursue their green cards \nunder the sponsorship of Defendant Signal.  P laintiffs were told that for an additional sum of \napproximately 35,000 to 45,000 rupees ($800 to $1,100), they could quickly obtain H-2B visas \nto go to the United States for work at Defendant Signalโs operations. \nPage 30 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v.

In t hese co mmunications, R ecruiter D efendants,  Legal F acilitator D efendants, \nand/or Labor Broker Defendants falsely assured Plaintiffs that Defendant Signal would seek at \nleast two extensions of the temporary H-2B visas with which Plaintiffs would gain admittance to \nthe United States, and that Plaintiffsโ H-2B visas would thereafter be converted to permanent \ngreen cards. \n158.  Upon i nformation a nd be lief, pr ior t o t hese c ommunications w ith  Plaintiffs, \nRecruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and Defendant Signal communicated and \nconsulted frequently via mail, fax, e-mail and/or telephone communications regarding the issues \nto be discussed and representations to be made to Plaintiffs. \n159.  In their communications with Plaintiffs, Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator \nDefendants, and/or Labor Broker Defendants further failed to disclose material facts regarding \nthe H-2B visa, including the fact that H-2B visas confer only a temporary non-immigrant status \nwhich does not allow the bearer to adjust to permanent residency status and the fact that applying \nfor H-2B visa status is fundamentally incompatible with simultaneously applying for a green \ncard. \n160.  Plaintiffs, unaware of U.S. immigration law and the temporary, nonimmigrant \ncharacter of H-2B visas and desperate not to forfeit the substantial fees that they had already \npaid, a greed, i n r eliance on t he r epresentations of  R ecruiter D efendants,  Legal F acilitator \nDefendants, a nd/or  Labor B roker D efendants,  to t ransfer t heir  green c ard a pplications t o \nDefendant Signalโs sponsorship and further agreed to work for Defendant Signal under H-2B \nvisas pursuant to the terms explained by Recruiter Defendants. \n161.

Plaintiffs would not have paid the extraordinary fees charged by the Recruiter \nDefendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and/or Labor Brokers Defendants for travel, green \ncards, visas, and employment opportunities had they known that these Defendants had failed to \ndisclose material facts concerning the nature and terms and conditions of the immigration and \nwork opportunities offered. \nPreparations and Departure for Signal Operations in the United States \n164.  At va rious t imes dur ing t he s pring, s ummer, a nd f all 2006, e mployees of  \nDefendant Signal traveled to various locations in India and the United Arab Emirates and tested \nPlaintiffsโ welding and pipefitting skills in anticipation of employing them in the United States. \n165.  Plaintiffs paid costs necessary to travel to the cities where these tests were held. \n166.  Plaintiffs paid admission fees charged to take these tests. \n167.  Plaintiffs attended and passed these tests, which were overseen and graded by \nDefendant Signalโs and/or Defendant Dewanโs agents, employees, and/or representatives. \n168.  Upon i nformation a nd be lief, pr ior t o a ttending t hese m eetings a nd t esting \nsessions, Defendant Signal, Recruiter Defendants, and Legal Facilitator Defendants conferred in \nPage 32 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v.

On or about July 20, 2006 and August 17, 2006, the United States Department of \nLabor approved Signalโs labor certification applications for 590 H-2B workers for the period of \nOctober 1, 2006 through July 31, 2007. \n170.  In approving these labor certification applications, the United States Department \nof Labor relied on the accuracy of the applicationsโ stated 10-month period of labor need.   \n171.  On information and belief, the Department of Labor is prohibited by its internal \nguidelines to grant labor certification applications without relying on the applicationโs statement \nof temporary labor need. \n172.  In l ate  August and  early  September 2006,  t he United S tates C itizenship and \nImmigration Service approved Signalโs H-2B visa petitions for 590 H-2B workers for the period \nof October 1, 2006 through July 31, 2007. \n173.  In approving these visa petitions, the United States Citizenship and Immigration \nService relied on the accuracy of the petitionsโ stated 10-month period of labor need and the \nrepresentation t hat Defendant S ignalโs need was based on a  one t ime peak-load t emporary \ndemand.   \n174.  The U nited S tates C itizenship a nd  Immigration S ervice mu st,  according to  \nregulation, rely on the stated period of the petitionerโs labor need, see 8 C.F.R.214.2(h)(6)(ii)(B) \n(2006).   \n175.  Defendant Signal, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and Recruiter Defendants knew \nthat the stated period of need in Signalโs applications for labor certifications and for H-2B visas \nPage 33 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 208   Filed 12/23/14   Page 34 of 69 PageID #:  7457\nwere inconsistent with Signalโs projected actual labor need and therefore Defendants knew these \nstatements to the government were false. \n176.  The Recruiter Defendants and the Legal Facilitator Defendants used the H-2B \nvisas, obtained from the U.S. Government on the basis of false statements by Defendant Signal \nand the Legal Facilitator Defendants, to elicit payments of the second and/or third installment \nfrom Plaintiffs and other class members. \n177.  Plaintiffs entered the United States on H-2B guestworker visas, issued by the U.S. \nGovernment on the basis of false statements by Defendant Signal and the Legal Facilitator \nDefendants, in late 2006 and early 2007 for the purposes of working for Defendant Signal at its \nOrange, Texas facility. \n178.  Around the time of USCISโs visa approval, Plaintiffs made necessary preparations \nin order to travel to the United States on H-2B visas to work for Signal, including: paying to \nobtain necessary travel and legal documents; making payments to the United States consulate, \nRecruiter Defendants and Legal Facilitator Defendants for mandatory H-2B visa and consular \nprocessing fees; attending H-2B visa interviews; and paying Recruiter Defendants for travel \narrangements. \n179.  In order to secure H-2B visas to work for Signal, Plaintiffs were required to be \ninterviewed by United States Consular offices in Indian cities. \n180.  These consular interviews necessitated that Plaintiffs pay the costs of travel from \ntheir homes and/or current places of employment to various large Indian cities including Chennai \n(Madras) and Mumbai (Bombay). \nPage 34 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 208   Filed 12/23/14   Page 35 of 69 PageID #:  7458\n181.  Recruiter Defendants and/or Legal Facilitator Defendants, acting as Defendant \nSignalโs a gents, r equired th at P laintiffs me et w ith R ecruiter D efendants a nd/or t he  Legal \nFacilitator Defendants in these Indian cities prior to attending their consular interviews. \n182.  Upon information and belief, prior to these meetings Recruiter Defendants and \nLegal Facilitator Defendants discussed amongst themselves and with Defendant Signal by e-\nmail, telephone, or in-person communications the topics to be discussed and instructions to be \ngiven to Plaintiffs and others similarly situated at these meetings. \n183.  At t hese p re-interview  meetings, R ecruiter D efendants an d  Legal F acilitator \nDefendants ensured that Plaintiffs were up-to-date on paying the fee installments required by \ntheir green card contracts. \n184.  Defendants further required that Plaintiffs pay an additional 35,000 t o 45,000 \nrupees ($800 to $1,100) fee for H-2B visa processing. \n185.  Recruiter Defendants and/or Legal Facilitator Defendants required Plaintiffs to \nsign documents permitting Defendant Sachin Dewan to receive their visa-stamped passports \nfrom the Consulate on Plaintiffsโ behalves. \n186.  Recruiter D efendants a nd/or  Legal F acilitator D efendants al so co ached t he \nPlaintiffs on what to say and what not to say during consular interviews.  Those Defendants, inter \nalia, told Plaintiffs not to say anything about the substantial fees Plaintiffs had been required to \npay, not to stay anything about expected green cards, and if asked to say that Plaintiffs expected \nto be in the United States for only several months and then would return to India.   \n187.  Recruiter Defendants and/or Legal Facilitator Defendants told Plaintiffs that if \nthey did not follow these instructions regarding the interviews, Plaintiffs would not receive their \nPage 35 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 208   Filed 12/23/14   Page 36 of 69 PageID #:  7459\nvisas and would forfeit the all moneys they had previously paid to Defendants, in addition to \nlosing their opportunity to permanently immigrate to the United States. \n188.  During P laintiffsโ c onsular in terviews, th e c onsular o fficials to ok P laintiffsโ \npassports from them. \n189.  Once Plaintiffsโ visas were approved, consular officials sent their passports, with \nH-2B visas affixed, directly to Defendant Dewan. \n190.  After receiving word that Plaintiffsโ visas were approved, Recruiter Defendants \nmade travel arrangements for Plaintiffsโ departures to the United States. \n191.  Before P laintiffs  could  leave  for t he U nited S tates, h owever, P laintiffs w ere \nrequired to attend final meetings in Recruiter Defendantsโ Mumbai (Bombay) office. \n192.  Such m eetings t ypically  took pl ace m ere hou rs be fore P laintiffsโ s cheduled \ndepartures to the United States, when Recruiter Defendantsโ office was teeming with anxious \nfellow Indian workers awaiting departure to the United States. \n193.  At th ese me etings, R ecruiter D efendants  collected f inal in stallment p ayments \nrequired by Plaintiffsโ green card contracts. \n194.  Recruiter D efendants a lso r equired t hat P laintiffs, m ost of  w hom do not  \nproficiently read or speak English, sign English language documents with little or no time for \nreview. \n195.  Recruiter Defendants refused to return Plaintiffsโ passports -- which had been in \nDefendant S achin Dewanโs pos session s ince a fter P laintiffsโ H-2B vi sas were  approved b y \nConsular O fficials  --  until a fter P laintiffs h ad p aid th e f inal in stallments a nd s igned th e \nmandatory paperwork. \nPage 36 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v.

In forceful tones, Recruiter Defendants or their staff demanded that Plaintiffs \nquickly sign the mandatory documents, lest they miss the flights to the United States which \nRecruiter Defendants had scheduled for them. \n197.  Without pos session of  t heir pa ssports a nd  within t his r ushed a nd hos tile \natmosphere, Plaintiffs had no r easonable opportunity to review, negotiate, and/or make any \nchanges to the documents presented them. \n198.  On occasions when workers who appeared at the Mumbai office failed to present \nsufficient funds to pay the final installment required by the green card contracts, Defendant \nDewan and his associates threatened to destroy and/or deface these workersโ passports. \n199.  Such threats were uttered in the presence of other workers, causing these workers \nto reasonably believe that they had no choice but to pay the final installments in full. \n200.  Based on the Recruiter Defendantsโ threatening and coercive behavior during \nthese pre-departure meetings in Mumbai and the extraordinary and increasing levels of debt they \nhad incurred to pay the Recruiter Defendants and Legal Facilitator Defendants for green card and \nH-2B visa arrangements, Plaintiffs reasonably believed that they had no choice but to make the \npayments required by the Recruiter Defendants and to travel to the United States to work for \nDefendant Signal. \n201.  Plaintiffs a nd a pproximately 560 ot her  Indian H -2B w orkers t raveled f rom \nMumbai to Defendant Signalโs operations in the U.S. at various times from late October 2006 to \nApril 2007 on tickets arranged by the Recruiter Defendants. \n202.  Pursuant to Defendant Signalโs instructions and arrangements, approximately 300 \nworkers were sent to Signalโs Pascagoula, Mississippi facility and approximately 290 workers, \nincluding these Plaintiffs, were sent to Signalโs Orange, Texas facility upon arrival in the United \nPage 37 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v.

The Plaintiffs had no c hoice but to use the Recruiter Defendants and the Legal \nFacilitator Defendants to secure employment at Defendant Signalโs operations. \n204.  The Plaintiffs had no choice but to pay the fees the Recruiter Defendants and the \nLegal Facilitator Defendants charged to secure employment at Defendant Signalโs operations. \n205.  Management personnel at Defendant Signal made the conscious and deliberate \ndecision to  p rohibit th e P laintiffs f rom s ecuring  employment  at S ignalโs o perations e ither \nthrough a nother r ecruiter or  b y b ypassing r ecruitersโ a ltogether a nd a pplying di rectly  with \nDefendant Signal.  \nConditions at the Signal Facility in Orange \n206.  Upon arrival at Defendant Signalโs facilities in Orange, Plaintiffs were shocked to \ndiscover that they were expected to live in isolated, overcrowded labor camps comprised of \ntrailer-like bunkhouses.  Workers who were sent to Pascagoula faced similar conditions. \n207.  Defendant Signalโs labor camps were located in isolated, industrial areas miles \nremoved from shopping areas, places of worship, and residential communities.  The camps were \nenclosed by fences and accessible only by a single guarded entrance. \n208.  The S ignal l abor cam p g ates at  t he T exas a nd M ississippi f acilities w ere \nconstantly monitored by security guards retained by Defendant Signal.   \n209.  Signalโs security guards monitored Plaintiffsโ comings and goings by requiring \nthem to show their employee identification badges and recording when Plaintiffs entered and \nexited the camps.  S ignalโs security guards also searched Plaintiffsโ packages and bags when \nthey entered the camp. \nPage 38 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 208   Filed 12/23/14   Page 39 of 69 PageID #:  7462\n210.  Except on rare occasions, Plaintiffs were not permitted to receive visitors in the \nSignal labor camps. \n211.  Up to twenty-four Indian men were housed in each bunkhouse and made to sleep \nin two-tiered bunk beds.  The bunk beds were so tightly packed in the bunkhouses that it was \ndifficult for workers to move about in the narrow passageways between bunks.  These housing \nconditions,  inter a lia, v iolated t he ap plicable h ealth an d s afety s tandards u nder t he f ederal \nOccupational Health and Safety Act. \n212.  The Signal labor camp bunkhouses had insufficient toileting and bathing facilities \nfor twenty-four men, resulting in long lines for the bathrooms before and after work shifts. \n213.  Privacy  was non -existent, an d P laintiffs o ften ex perienced ex treme d ifficulty \nsleeping due to the constant noise resulting from the close quarters and the comings and goings \nof workers who worked on different shifts. \n214.  Defendant Signalโs personnel and/or security guards conducted surprise searches \nof the dormitory areas of the bunkhouses, including searches of workersโ personal belongings. \n215.  Plaintiffs took their meals in Defendant Signalโs mess halls, which were only \nopen during limited hours.  Due to filthy and unhygienic kitchen conditions, Plaintiffs frequently \nbecame ill, sometimes requiring hospitalization. \n216.  Upon i nformation a nd be lief, D efendant S ignal di d not  obt ain  the r equired \npermit(s) to furnish the board at its Texas โman camp,โ and the condition and sanitation of the \nboard further violated federal, state, and/or local law including, inter alia, the U.S. Food and \nDrug Administration Code, as adopted and modified by Texas Food Establishment Rules. \nPage 39 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 208   Filed 12/23/14   Page 40 of 69 PageID #:  7463\n217.  Defendant Signal deducted labor camp fees of approximately $35 per day ($245 \nper week, or approximately $1,050 per month) from Plaintiffsโ paychecks for these substandard \naccommodations and meals. \n218.  When Plaintiffs complained and asked to live outside the labor camps, Defendant \nSignal initially refused and subsequently told workers that if they tried to live outside the camps \nSignal would still deduct the labor camp fees from Plaintiffsโ wages.   As a result, Plaintiffs \nreasonably felt that they had no choice but to continue living in the Signal camps. \n219.  Defendant Signal only housed Indian H-2B workers such as Plaintiffs in its labor \ncamps, which employees and management at Signal referred to as the โreservation(s),โ in a \nderogatory play on the common name (โIndianโ) for Plaintiffsโ ethnicity and Native Americans.  \nUpon information and belief, workers of non-Indian descent and United States citizen employees \nwere n either r equired n or allowed t o l ive i n a nd/or pa y for  accommodations i n Defendant \nSignalโs labor camps. \n220.  Defendant Signal subjected Plaintiffs to skills testing and re-testing, on-the-job \ndiscipline, l ayoffs, p eriods w ithout w ork, l ack of  s afety p recautions, unf avorable j ob \nassignments, evaluation processes, and other adverse employment actions to which non-Indian \nand U.S. citizen workers were not similarly subjected. \n221.  In addition, Signal camp personnel and supervisors frequently subject Plaintiffs to \nan objectively hostile and abusive environment.  They often used offensive language in speaking \nwith and/or referring to Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers and regularly insulted Plaintiffs \nand other Indian H-2B workers on the basis of their race, national origin, and/or alienage. \n222.  During the first week of employing Plaintiffs and others similarly situated in the \nUnited States, Defendant Signal did not reimburse Plaintiffs and others similarly situated for any \nPage 40 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 208   Filed 12/23/14   Page 41 of 69 PageID #:  7464\nof the expenses that Plaintiffs and others similarly situated were required to incur as a pre-\ncondition of seeking employment with Signal. \n223.  During the first two weeks of employing Plaintiffs and others similarly situated in \nthe United States, Defendant Signal deducted approximately $100 t o $200 each week from \nPlaintiffsโ and other similarly situated workersโ checks for job-related tool kits which they were \nrequired to purchase from Defendant Signal. \n224.  Over the course of their employment at Defendant Signal, Plaintiffs and others \nsimilarly situated were routinely awarded a fifty cent per hour โsafety bonusโ for workweeks \nwhen they were not written up for violations of Defendant Signalโs safety rules.   \n225.  The safety bonus Defendant Signal paid the Plaintiffs and others similarly situated \nwas in addition to their regular hourly wage. \n226.  Upon information and belief, the safety bonus was non-discretionary with respect \nboth to the decision to pay the bonus and to the amount of the bonus. \n227.  Defendant S ignal paid t he s afety bonus  t o t he P laintiffs and ot hers s imilarly \nsituated pursuant to a prior agreement or promise causing the Plaintiffs and others similarly \nsituated to expect the bonus payments regularly if they met the required safety criteria. \n228.  During workweeks when the Plaintiffs and others similarly situated worked more \nthan 40 hour s, Defendant Signal did not pay one and one-half times the amount of the safety \nbonus for all overtime hours worked.  \n229.  Signal personnel and management regularly threatened Plaintiffs and other H-2B \nworkers that if they did not continue working for Signal, or did not work according to Signalโs \nspecifications, Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers would be deported back to India. \nPage 41 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v.

In the isolated and guarded atmosphere of the labor camp and grappling with the \ncrushing debts they had incurred to come to the United States, Plaintiffs reasonably felt that \nSignalโs statements were threatening and felt forced to continue working for Signal despite \nterrible working and living conditions. \n231.  At regular meetings and in one-on-one or small group conversations with Signal \ncamp pe rsonnel  and m anagement, s ome w orkers, i ncluding s ome of   the P laintiffs, voi ced \ncomplaints regarding the discriminatory treatment to which Indian H-2B workers were subject.  \nOther similarly situated workers also voiced complaints, in both the Orange and Pascagoula \ncamps.   \n232.  Workers V ijayan a nd  Kadakkarappally, t wo of  t he pl aintiffs i n t he  David \nLitigation, took leading roles in gathering and voicing othersโ complaints to Defendant Signalโs \npersonnel in camp meetings in Pascagoula. \n233.  When Indian workers, including Vijayan and Kadakkarappally, voiced grievances \nregarding hous ing, f ood, a nd  wages, D efendant S ignalโs p ersonnel  warned t hem t o s top \ncomplaining. \n234.  When Signal took no action in response to workersโ complaints, numerous Indian \nH-2B workers living at the Pascagoula labor camp, including Vijayan and Kadakkarappally, \nbegan meeting collectively to discuss how to persuade Signal to improve conditions in its labor \ncamps, and also began meeting with third parties to discuss how best to address their concerns. \n235.  Defendant Signal became aware of these meetings, including meetings between \nworkers, including Vijayan and Kadakkarappally, and third parties whom Signal believed to be \nattorneys. \nPage 42 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v.

Defendant Signal, through its employees and/or agents, contacted the Recruiter \nDefendants and Legal Facilitator Defendants to express its concerns about worker organizing \nefforts and the specific involvement of Vijayan and Kadakkarappally. \n237.  Upon information and belief, during these conversations Recruiter Defendants, \nLegal Facilitator Defendants, and Signal reached an agreement regarding steps that they would \ntake to discourage further worker organizing efforts and to ensure that the majority of the Indian \nH-2B workforce continued to work at Signal without complaint, as well as to prevent the Indian \nH-2B workforce from exercising their legal rights. \n238.  Upon information and belief, Signal management and camp personnel conferred \nand planned internally and with the private Swetman security firm in Mississippi to respond to \nworkersโ organizing activities and to take actions to ensure that the majority of the Indian H-2B \nworkforce continued to work at Signal without complaint, as well as to prevent the Indian H-2B \nworkforce from exercising their legal rights. \n239.  On or about March 7, 2007, Defendant Sachin Dewan called Vijayanโs wife at her \nhome in India and warned her that Vijayan must stop making trouble at Signal. \n240.  Vijayanโs w ife in formed V ijayan o f th is c all, a nd V ijayan  called D efendant \nDewan on or about March 8, 2007.  During that conversation, Defendant Dewan told Vijayan \nthat Dewan had learned from Defendant Signal that Vijayan was organizing the workers and \nmaking trouble.  Defendant Dewan told Vijayan that if the organizing continued, all the workers \nwould be sent back to India. \n241.  Vijayan i nformed ot her  Indian  workers a bout  the c alls h e a nd hi s w ife  had \nreceived from Defendant Dewan, and word spread quickly through the Pascagoula and Orange \ncamps and to these Plaintiffs, regarding the threats against Vijayan. \nPage 43 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 208   Filed 12/23/14   Page 44 of 69 PageID #:  7467\n242.

Defendant Signal called a workforce-wide meeting on or about March 8, 2007 in \nthe Pascagoula camp, attended by Signal management and Defendant Burnett. \n244.  At this meeting, Signal management told the Pascagoula workers that Signal \nwould fight back against organizing efforts by the workers. \n245.  Signal management further threatened that Signal would not extend Plaintiffsโ and \nall other Indian H-2B workersโ visas if any of the workers took legal action against Signal.  At \nthat same meeting Defendant Burnett told the workers that they were ineligible for other kinds of \nimmigration relief and could depend only on Signal to maintain their H-2B immigration status \nand pursue their green card applications.  These threats were promptly reported to the workers in \nOrange, including Plaintiffs. \n246.  At or about the same time as this camp-wide meeting in Pascagoula, Mississippi, \nSignal m anagement m ade t he d ecision  to t erminate  and f orcibly de port V ijayan  and \nKadakkarappally, along with Kuldeep Singh, Kumar, and Chellappan, three Pascagoula workers \nwho are also plaintiffs in the David Litigation, and to do s o by means that would make an \nexample of them for the other Indian workers in Pascagoula and in Orange, in order to keep \nthose workers in line. \nPage 44 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 208   Filed 12/23/14   Page 45 of 69 PageID #:  7468\n247.  Early on the morning of March 9, 2007, Signal locked the gate to its Pascagoula \nlabor camp, thereby obstructing the sole means of direct entry to and exit from the camp. \n248.  Around t his s ame t ime, S ignal c amp c oordinator D arrell S nyder, a nd \napproximately five security guards, some or all of whom were obtained through the private \nSwetman S ecurity  firm, s wept t hrough t he bunkhous es c arrying pi ctures o f V ijayan, \nKadakkarappally, K. Singh, Kumar, and Chellappan. \n249.  Security guards began accosting workers to determine whether they were the \nindividuals shown in the pictures. \n250.  Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers at both camps became increasingly \nfrightened and confused by these activities, particularly when word spread that Signal had locked \nthe gate that served as the sole exit from the Pascagoula labor camp. \n251.  Around 5:15 AM that morning, Vijayan was walking towards the dining area.  A \nsecurity guard and Darrell Snyder, a S ignal employee, aggressively confronted Vijayan and \ninstructed him that he was in their custody. \n252.  Based on the threats made at the meeting on March 8, 2007 and Vijayanโs recent \nphone call with Sachin Dewan, Vijayan feared what Defendant Signal might do to him. \n253.  Vijayan began to panic, thinking of the enormous quantity of money he had spent \nto come to the United States and the massive debts he owed in India.   Vijayan knew that he \nwould not be able to repay such debts if he were deported and no longer employed by Signal. \n254.  These feelings, combined with Vijayanโs reasonable fear that Snyder and the \nsecurity guards might physically hurt him, drove Vijayan to attempt suicide.  Vijayan had to be \ntransported from the labor camp to a local hospital for immediate medical attention. \nPage 45 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 208   Filed 12/23/14   Page 46 of 69 PageID #:  7469\n255.  While a ttempting to  a ssist V ijayan in  o btaining me dical  attention, \nKadakkarappally was grabbed by Darrell Snyder and/or one or more of the security guards. \n256.  Kadakkarappally was taken forcefully by the arm and marched into a communal \nroom in the labor camp referred to by workers as โthe TV room.โ \n257.  Upon arriving in the TV room, Kadakkarappally found two workers already held \ninside.  Earlier that morning, Darrell Snyder and the security guards had grabbed Chellappan in \nthe communal eating area and Kumar in his bunkhouse and forced both of them into the TV \nroom, where they were kept under guard and prevented from leaving. \n258.  In the TV room, Darrell Snyder informed Kadakkarappally that he and Kumar \nand Chellappan were fired and would be taken to the airport to be deported to India. Snyder \ndemanded that Kadakkarappally stay inside the TV room, and Kadakkarappally was prevented \nfrom leaving the TV room by security guards.   \n259.  Kuldeep Singh, upon realizing Snyder and the security guards were looking for \nhim and intended to apprehend and detain him, hid himself and later fled the camp via an \nadjacent work area. \n260.  Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan were detained in the TV room, under \nguard, from approximately 6 a.m. for several hours. \n261.  Several security guards watched over Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan \nwhile t hey w ere de tained.  O ver t he c ourse of  s everal hour s, s ecurity  guards  denied \nKadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappanโs repeated requests to be let out of the TV room, to get \nsomething to drink, or to use the bathroom. \n262.  When Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappanโs co-workers attempted to come \ninto the TV room to talk to the three workers kept inside, the security guards pushed them back. \nPage 46 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 208   Filed 12/23/14   Page 47 of 69 PageID #:  7470\n263.  Confused and frightened, workers assembled outside the TV room to protest the \ntreatment of Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan. \n264.  At around 10 A M, Signal camp personnel finally permitted Kadakkarappally, \nKumar, and Chellappan to use the bathroom accompanied by security guards, one at a time. \n265.  Around noon, D arrell Snyder and a Pascagoula police officer entered the TV \nroom and the officer questioned why Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan were there.   \nSnyder said that these workers had been fired and would be sent back to India. \n266.  By early afternoon on March 9, 2007, local media, religious advocates, and other \nindividuals had gathered outside the camp gate to express their concern over the attempted \nsuicide of Vijayan and the forced detention of Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan.   \n267.  Faced w ith g rowing pr otests b y c ommunity m embers a nd S ignal e mployees, \nDefendant Signal decided not to forcibly transport Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan to \nthe airport for deportation to India, and instead escorted them from the Pascagoula labor camp. \n268.  Other  Indian H -2B w orkers, i ncluding t hese  Plaintiffs, w orking a t  Signalโs \nOrange facilities rapidly learned of the events at the Pascagoula labor camp on March 9, 2007.  \nIn response and out of fear for their continued well-being, some workers surreptitiously fled both \ncamps. \n269.  Within a few days of Plaintiffsโ and other Indian H-2B workersโ arrival at its \nlabor camps in late 2006 and early 2007, Signal personnel had conducted meetings at the labor \ncamps between Plaintiffs and representatives from specific banks.   In Orange, these meetings \nwere with representatives from Capital One Bank. \n270.  At th e in struction o f  Defendant S ignal, P laintiffs o pened a ccounts  with th e \ndesignated bank and agreed to directly deposit their wages in these accounts.  Defendant Signalโs \nPage 47 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 208   Filed 12/23/14   Page 48 of 69 PageID #:  7471\nestablishment of Plaintiffsโ accounts with these banks gave it unique access to and control over \nPlaintiffsโ funds. \n271.  At some point before April 10, 2007, on information and belief, after some Indian \nH-2B workers had fled Signalโs Mississippi camp, the bank with which those workers had \nestablished similar accounts denied those departed workers access to their bank accounts and \ninvalidated their ATM cards.   \n272.  Upon information and belief, that Mississippi bank refused the departed workers \naccess to their own bank accounts at Defendant Signalโs behest. \n273.  Indian H-2B workers still working at Signal labor camps, including the Plaintiffs, \nheard about the difficulty departed Signal workers had in accessing their funds through Signal-\nestablished bank accounts and reasonably believed that similar action might be taken against \nthem should they try to leave Defendant Signalโs employ. \n274.  The information about workersโ inability to access their money, combined with \nother factors described herein, contributed to the reasonable beliefs of Plaintiffs and the other \nremaining Indian H-2B workers that if they tried to leave the employ of Defendant Signal they \nwould face serious harm and/or threatened or actual abuse of the legal process. \n275.  Defendant Signalโs actions on a nd after March 9, 2007 s ignificantly intensified \nthe reasonable fears of the remaining Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers in the Pascagoula \nand Orange camps that if they tried to leave Signalโs employ or oppose unlawful and coercive \nemployment conditions at Signal, including by consulting with counsel, they faced the threat of \nphysical restraint, detention, forced deportation, or other serious harms and/or abuses of the legal \nprocess. \nPage 48 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 208   Filed 12/23/14   Page 49 of 69 PageID #:  7472\n276.  Throughout the spring and summer of 2007, Signal personnel in the Mississippi \nand Texas camps held various meetings with the remaining Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B \nworkers to discuss the status of Plaintiffsโ and other Indian H-2B workersโ visas and green card \napplications. \n277.  Upon information and belief, during spring and summer 2007 S ignal personnel \nconferred am ongst t hemselves an d w ith t he R ecruiter D efendants an d  the  Legal F acilitator \nDefendants via phone and/or e-mail to reach agreement on what should be said to workers \nattending the meetings. \n278.  Soon a fter M arch 9, 2 007, D efendant S ignal  held a  c amp-wide me eting in  \nPascagoula.  S ignal personnel told the Indian H-2B workers that Signal would sponsor their \ngreen cards if they stayed at Signal and obeyed Signalโs rules, and warned that if workers held \nany meetings against Signalโs interests, they would be terminated.  As Signal understood would \nhappen, w orkers a t t he O range  camp, i ncluding P laintiffs, pr omptly l earned w hat S ignal \npersonnel had said at this meeting, and understood it would apply to workers at Orange, as well.   \n279.  In that same time period, Defendants Dewan and Burnett came to the Signal camp \nin Orange, Texas and again promised, in the presence of Signal personnel, that Signal, through \nits attorney Defendant Burnett, would make bona fide applications for green cards and obtain \nseveral H-2B visa extensions for the workers who had not been terminated by Signal (plaintiffs \nin the David Litigation, including David, Sulekha, Thangamani, Kandhasamy, Khuttan, Andrews \nand Dhananjaya), and the other Indian H-2B workers.  Plaintiffs reasonably believed these \npromises. \n280.  In meetings and conversations in spring and summer 2007, D efendant Signal, \nthrough its agents and employees at the Pascagoula and Orange facilities, continued to promise \nPage 49 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v. Signal, et al. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 208   Filed 12/23/14   Page 50 of 69 PageID #:  7473\nthat Signal would arrange for the H-2B visa extensions and green cards originally promised \nPlaintiffs when they were recruited in India and the United Arab Emirates. \n281.  At the same time as Defendant Signal was promising to arrange for H-2B visa \nextensions and green cards for the Plaintiffs as well as other Indian H-2B workers, Signal in fact \nwas secretly evaluating all of the Indian workers with the intent not even to apply for visa \nextensions for certain of the Indian H-2B workers. \n282.  Plaintiffsโ continuing dependence on Defendant Signal for their present and future \nimmigration s tatus, t heir c ontinuing hi gh l evels of  i ndebtedness,  as  well a s ot her  factors \nreasonably led Plaintiffs to fear serious harm and/or abuse of the legal process if they left \nSignalโs employ. \n283.  Under such circumstances, these Plaintiffs reasonably felt like they had no choice \nbut to continue working for Signal. \n284.  At v arious time s r elevant to  P laintiffsโ c laims, D efendant S ignal r efused to  \nconfirm whether valid H-2B visa extensions had in fact been obtained for Plaintiffs, coercing \nPlaintiffs to continue working for Signal in the hope that Signal would finally resolve their \nuncertain immigration status. \n285.  Since first contracting with Defendants in India and the United Arab Emirates, \nPlaintiffs h ave  yet t o r eceive  from D efendants t he green c ards D efendants p romised t hem.  \nDespite clear contractual provisions requiring them to do so, the Recruiter Defendants, the Legal \nFacilitator Defendants, and the Labor Broker Defendants have refused to refund any of the \nmoneys Plaintiffs paid to them for unsuccessful green card and visa processing. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \nTHE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2003  \n \nForced Labor (18 U.S.C. ยง 1589) and 18 U.S.C. ยง 1590 (trafficking with respect to peonage, \nPage 50 of 69 \nThird Amended Complaint - Joseph, et al.  v.

' \n  ' \nv.    '    1:13-CV-324 \n  ' \nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL L.L.C.,   ' \net al.               ' \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON  \nBILLY WILKSโS MOTION TO DISMISS (DOC. NO. 229) \n \n  This case is assigned to the Honorable Ron Clark, Chief United States District Judge, and \nis referred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge for all pretrial matters pursuant to a \nReferral Order.  (Doc. No. 4.)  Pending before the undersigned is the โMotion to Dismissโ (Doc. \nNo. 229) filed by Defendant, Billy Wilks (โWilksโ).  The Plaintiffs oppose.  (Doc. No. 261.) \n  The Plaintiffs allege that Wilks is one of the โLabor Broker Defendants,โ and that this set \nof Defendants played a vital role in the alleged scheme to bring the Plaintiffs to the United States \nunder the false pretense that they would receive permanent residency.  (Doc. No. 208, pp. 22โ27) \n(discussing the recruitment process).  In addition, the Plaintiffs claim that Wilks is personally \nliable for the conduct of J &M Associates of Mississippi, Inc. (โJ & Mโ) because he โhad full \ncontrol and decision making authority over J & M such that J & M and Wilks were alter egos of \none another.โ  (Doc. No. 208, p. 18.)   \n  On February 23, 2015, Wilks filed a โMotion to Dismiss.โ  (Doc. No. 229.)  In this \nmotion, Wilks seeks dismissal of the claims against him because, according to him, based on the \nโundisputed factsโ he โhad absolutely no dealings with Signal, Global, Burnet, or Dewan in the \nprocessing of the Plaintiffs.โ  (Id.)  Wilks also attached another motion to dismiss, which he \nclaims he filed in August of 2014.  In this motion, Wilks makes the same generic assertion of \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 282   Filed 03/17/15   Page 2 of 3 PageID #:  8797\ninnocence.  (Id.) (โThis complaint fails to offer a bona fide claim which relief can be granted.  \nNone of the charges are true.โ).  This August motion, however, is not reflected on the docket.     \n  After reviewing Wilksโs motion, the undersigned recommends that it be denied.  First, it is \nuntimely.  The second amended scheduling order set October 17, 2014 as the deadline for \ndispositive motions.  Wilks received this order on August 4, 2014, leaving him ample time to file \na dispositive motion.  (Doc. No. 125.)   \nSetting the untimeliness of Wilksโs motion aside, his motion should be denied on the \nmerits.  It appears that Wilks is moving for dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6).  Accordingly, the inquiry is whether the Plaintiffs have stated a plausible claim for \nrelief.  Typically, courts are not to consider extrinsic evidence and take all well-pled facts as true.  \nSee Lone Star Fund V (U.S.), L.P. v. Barclays Bank PLC, 594 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir. 2010).  \nAfter reviewing the Plaintiffsโ complaint, the undersigned finds that they have stated a plausible \nclaim against Wilks.  The Plaintiffsโ complaint offers numerous facts showing that J &M was \ninvolved in the recruitment process.  Moreover, there are sufficient facts that Wilks was in control \nof J & M, and therefore, it plausible that Wilks is the alter ego of J & M, and as such, personally \nliable.  Moreover, all Wilks offers to support the fact that he is not liable are blanket assertions he \nโhad no dealingsโ with the other defendants, or that โthe J & M defendants should not be in this \nsuit.โ  (Doc. No. 229.)  These statements, standing alone, are insufficient to absolve Wilks of any \nwrongdoing.1  \n \n                                                 \n1.  Given that Wilks is proceeding pro se, his pleadings are held to less stringent standards and are to be \nconstrued liberally.  Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972); Perez v. United States, 312 F.3d 191, 194โ95 (5th \nCir. 2002).  Therefore, even if Wilksโs motion is construed as a motion for summary judgment, because he has \nattached no evidence to support his claim that he had no involvement in the operative facts of this case, his motion \nfails.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00324-RC-ZJH   Document 282   Filed 03/17/15   Page 3 of 3 PageID #:  8798\nRecommendation \n  For the reasons stated above, the undersigned recommends that Billy Wilksโs โMotion to \nDismissโ (Doc. No. 229) be DENIED. \nObjections \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(c) (Supp. IV 2011), each party to this action has the right \nto file objections to this report and recommendation.  Objections to this report must (1) be in \nwriting, (2) specifically identify those findings or recommendations to which the party objects, (3) \nbe served and filed within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this report; and (4) \nbe no more than eight pages in length.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(c); FED R. CIV. P. 72(b)(2); \nLOCAL RULE CV-72(c).  A party who objects to this report is entitled to a de novo determination \nby the United States District Judge of those proposed findings and recommendations to which a \nspecific objection is timely made.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(c); FED R. CIV. P. 72(b)(3).   \n  A partyโs failure to file specific, written objections to the proposed findings of fact and \nconclusions of law contained in this report, within fourteen days of being served with a copy of this \nreport, bars that party from: (1) entitlement to de novo review by the United States District Judge \nof the findings of fact and conclusions of law, see Rodriguez v. Bowen, 857 F.2d 275, 276โ77 (5th \nCir. 1988), and (2) appellate review, except on grounds of plain error, of any such findings of fact \nand conclusions of law accepted by the United States District Judge.  See Douglass v. United \nServs. Auto. Assโn, 79 F.3d 1415, 1428โ29 (5th Cir. 1996). \n  SIGNED this 17th day of March, 2015.\n \n_________________________\nZack Hawthorn\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n3 \n ",
