    "summary": "<p>This case is part of the series of <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=33\">Signal International cases</a>. It is stayed during defendant's bankruptcy and settlement proceedings.</p><p>On Aug. 7, 2013, four Indian guestworkers filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas for harm suffered as a result of an allegedly fraudulent and coercive employment recruitment scheme. Plaintiffs filed this suit after District Judge Jay Zainey <a href=\"http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-LA-0010-0016.pdf\">denied class certification</a> on January 3, 2012 in a related case, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14377\"><i>David v. Signal International</i></a>.</p><p>Plaintiffs were allegedly brought into the United States to provide labor and services to defendant Signal International. Signal is based in Pascagoula, Mississippi and is in the business of providing repairs to offshore oil rigs in the Gulf Coast region. Three plaintiffs worked at Signal's site in Orange, Texas and one plaintiff worked in Pascagoula. The complaint alleged that plaintiffs paid Signal's recruiters as much as $20,000 for travel, visa, and recruitment fees, but upon arrival in the United States found out they would not receive the green cards promised to them. Instead, plaintiffs were forced to pay additional fees to live in racially segregated labor camps ($1050 per month), and were subject to squalid living conditions and threats of both legal and physical harm if they complained about the conditions or decided not to provide labor. </p><p>Plaintiffs asserted claims under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (18 U.S.C. §1584 et seq, the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act (18 U.S.C. §1962, the Declaratory Judgment Act (28 U.S.C. §2201), as well as claims of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract. Plaintiffs were represented by a private law firm.</p><p>In July 2014, Magistrate Judge Zack Hawthorn denied Signal's motion to transfer this case to the Eastern District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs in this case only overlapped with the <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14377\"><i>David</i></a> case insofar as their FLSA claims in the <i>David</i> case were concerned. Magistrate Judge Hawthorn found the similarity in issues in the cases was not substantial enough to warrant transfer because the current venue was otherwise proper. </p><p>In June 2015, Magistrate Judge Hawthorn severed and transferred Signal's cross-claims against co-defendants (immigration attorneys, recruiters, and labor brokers) to the Eastern District of Louisiana, finding that there was significant overlap between Signal's crossclaims in this case and in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14377\"><i>David</i></a>.</p><p>In July 2015, the Court stayed the case after Signal filed for bankruptcy. <i>In re Signal Int’l, Inc, et al.,</i> No. 15-11498 (Bankr.

As a part of the bankruptcy filings, the plaintiffs entered into a plan support agreement (PSA) which contemplated a settlement of the claims of this lawsuit against Signal entities through a consensual chapter 11 plan proposed by Signal.

' \n  ' \nv.  '    1:13-CV-497 \n  ' \nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL L.L.C. et al  ' \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION DENYING THE BURNETT DEFENDANTS’ \nMOTION TO DISMISS (DOC. NO. 11) \n \nThis case is assigned to the Honorable Marcia A. Crone, United States District Judge, and \nis referred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge for all pretrial matters pursuant to a \nReferral Order.   (Doc. No. 2.)   Before the undersigned is a “Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)” filed by Malvern C. Burnett, the Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, \nA.P.C., and Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, L.L.C (hereinafter referred to interchangeably \nas “Burnett” and “the Burnett Defendants”).  (Doc. No. 11.)  The undersigned has considered \nthe pending motion and the corresponding response (Doc. No. 21).   The Burnett Defendants’ \nmotion should be denied because the Plaintiffs have sufficiently stated a claim upon which relief \ncan be granted, and a motion for summary judgment is the proper vehicle to prove the Plaintiffs \nstate law claims are barred by the statute of limitations. \nI.  Background \nA.  Procedural Background \n  On March 7, 2008, twelve individuals who were allegedly trafficked into the United \nStates filed a putative class action against the Defendants in the Eastern District of Louisiana.  \nSee David v. Signal Int’l, LLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220 (E.D. La.).  That Court denied class \n1 of 13 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 49   Filed 08/04/14   Page 2 of 13 PageID #:  800\ncertification;1 and, as a result of this ruling, the Plaintiffs in the instant action filed suit in this \nDistrict, where they were allegedly subjected to deplorable working conditions at a Signal’s \nOrange, Texas and Pascagoula, Mississippi facilities.  (Doc. No. 1.)   On August 7, 2013, the \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint in this court against the Burnett Defendants, Signal International, \nL.L.C., Signal International, Inc., Signal International Texas, G.P., Signal International Texas, \nL.P. (hereinafter collectively referred to  as “Signal”), Michael  Pol,  Global  Resources,  Inc., \nSachin Dewan and Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd.  (Id.)  Subsequently, the Burnett Defendants \nfiled the instant motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).   (Doc. \nNo. 11.)    \nB.  Factual Background     \n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, approximately 590 men, including the Plaintiffs, \nwere allegedly trafficked into the United States through the federal government’s H-2B guest \nworker program to provide labor and services to the Signal Defendants.   (Doc. No. 1, p. 1.)  \nThe Plaintiffs claim they were lured to work for Signal through the fraudulent promise of legal \nand permanent work-based immigration to the United States for themselves and their families.  \n(Id.,  p.  2.)    Subsequently,  after  coming  to  the  United  States,  the  Plaintiffs  were  allegedly \nsubjected to forced labor and other serious abuses at Signal operations in Orange, Texas and \nPascagoula, Mississippi.  (Id., p. 3.)     \nThe Burnett Defendants consist of Malvern C. Burnett and his two corporations: Gulf \nCoast Immigration Law Center, L.L.C. and the Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C.  The \nPlaintiffs  accuse  Burnett  of  conspiring  with  Signal  and  other  Defendants  to  recruit  Indian \nwelders and pipefitters to fill anticipated H-2B guest worker jobs at Signal’s operations with \n                                         \n  1.  David v. Signal Int’l, LLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. \nJan. 3, 2012). \n2 of 13 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 49   Filed 08/04/14   Page 3 of 13 PageID #:  801\nfalse promises of permanent residency in the United States for the workers and their families.   \n(Id.)     \nII.   Jurisdiction \n  The Plaintiffs seek recovery pursuant to several federal statutes.  For actions brought \nunder these statutory provisions, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon federal \nquestion jurisdiction.   See 28 U.S.C. § 1331; 29 U.S.C. § 216(b).  For the state law causes of \naction, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon supplemental jurisdiction.   See \n28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).   Venue is proper because the events giving rise to the above claims \noccurred within the confines of this District.   See 28 U.S.C. § 1391. \nIII.   Rule 12(b)(6) Standard \nRule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes dismissal of a complaint \nthat fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).   A Rule \n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss “is viewed with disfavor and is rarely granted.”   Harrington v. State \nFarm Fire & Cas. Co., 563 F.3d 141, 147 (5th Cir. 2009).  When a court analyzes a Rule \n12(b)(6) motion, it “accepts ‘all well-pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light most \nfavorable to the plaintiff.’”   In re Katrina Beaches Litig., 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007) \n(quoting Martin K. Eby Constr. Co. v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit, 369 F.3d 464, 467 (5th Cir. \n2004)).  A court should grant such a motion only when the complaint fails to contain “enough \nfacts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”   Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 \nU.S. 544, 570 (2007).   A claim is plausible on its face “when the plaintiff pleads factual content \nthat  allows  the  court  to  draw  the  reasonable  inference  that  the  defendant  is  liable  for  the \nmisconduct alleged.”   Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  “Threadbare recitals of the \nelements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.”   Id. \n3 of 13 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 49   Filed 08/04/14   Page 4 of 13 PageID #:  802\nIV.  Analysis \n  The Plaintiffs allege Burnett violated the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization \nAct (“TVPRA”) and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”).   (Doc. \nNo. 1); see 18 U.S.C. §§ 1584-1595; §§ 1962(c) and 1962(d).  The Plaintiffs have also asserted \nstate law claims of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract against Burnett.  \n(Id.)   First, Burnett argues the Plaintiffs have failed to provide sufficient facts to state any \nclaim.  (Doc. No. 11.)   Second, Burnett asserts the Plaintiffs’ state law claims are barred by the \nstatute of limitations.  (Id.) \nA.   Failure to State a Claim under Rule 12(b)(6) \n  1.   Insufficient Facts \n  Burnett generally argues the Plaintiffs failed to state more than mere conclusions and \nrecitals of statutory language without any basis in fact in their complaint.   In particular, Burnett \nargues that the Plaintiffs did not provide any facts showing Burnett engaged in illegal activity.  \nIn addition, Burnett argues that each of the Plaintiffs’ federal claims “has as its linchpin” the \nfalse  concept  “that  threats  of  deportation  satisfy  the  definition  of  involuntary  servitude.”    \n(Doc. No. 11, p. 2.) \n  First,  the  undersigned  finds,  contrary  to  Burnett’s  assertion,  that  the  Plaintiffs  have \nsufficiently alleged facts that allow the court to draw the reasonable inference that Burnett is \nliable for the alleged misconduct.   In their complaint the Plaintiffs allege the following: \n  At  all  relevant  times,  the  Burnett  Defendants  acted  as \nagents of Defendant Signal for the purpose of recruiting, obtaining, \ncontracting with, transporting and/or providing Plaintiffs for labor \nor services in Signal’s Orange, Texas, and Pascagoula, Mississippi, \nfacilities.  During this process, the Burnett Defendants induced \nPlaintiffs  to  enter  into  employment  agreements  by  falsely \npromising  to  help  them  secure  green  cards.    In  actuality,  the \nDefendants lacked the intent to diligently pursue the Plaintiffs’ \n4 of 13 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 49   Filed 08/04/14   Page 5 of 13 PageID #:  803\ngreen card applications. They also lacked any basis whatsoever for \nrepresenting, inter alia, that 1) the companies and/or entities that \npurportedly  were  sponsoring  Plaintiffs’  applications  were \nfinancially  solvent  and  had  reliable  and  stable  employment \nopportunities to provide the Plaintiffs; 2) green card applications \nsponsored by those companies would be valid and bona fide under \nU.S. immigration law; and 3) any applications were likely to be \nsuccessfully  completed  and  approved  within  the  promised \ntimelines.    \n  All  of  the  Plaintiffs  undertook  considerable  economic, \nsocial,  familial,  and  personal  sacrifices  to  obtain  the  funds \nnecessary to cover the fees paid to all of the Defendants involved \nin  the  recruitment  process,  including  Burnett.    Since  first \ncontracting with the Defendants in India, the Plaintiffs have yet to \nreceive  the  green  cards  that  the  Defendants  promised  them.  \nDespite  clear  contractual  provisions  requiring  them  to  do  so, \nBurnett has refused to refund any of the Plaintiffs’ money, which \nwas  paid  to  them  for  the  express  purpose  of  processing  and \nobtaining green cards and visas for the Plaintiffs. \n  In late May and early June of 2006, the Burnett Defendants \nfiled with the Texas Workforce Commission the completed forms \nETA 750 and attachments seeking permission to import and hire \n590  foreign  guest  workers  under  the  auspices  of  8  U.S.C.  § \n1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b), attendant regulations 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(6) \nand 20 C.F.R. § 655.3 and associated administrative letters and/or \nguidance (commonly known as “the H-2B guest worker program”) \non behalf of Signal.    Burnett knew Signal projected the labor need \nthat it sought to fill with foreign workers to be for at least two to \nthree years.  However, in these applications, they only stated that \nthey would employ the workers from October 1, 2006 to July 31, \n2007.  Furthermore, they stated that “the temporary workers will \nwork for the length of the prescribed dates of need, will be paid in \naccordance with the prevailing wage and will return to their home \ncountry at the end of employment.”  The Plaintiffs entered the \nUnited States on H-2B  guest  worker visas, issued by the U.S. \nGovernment on the basis of false statements in late 2006 and early \n2007  for  the  purposes  of  working  for  Defendant  Signal  at  its \nPascagoula, Mississippi, and Orange, Texas, facilities. \n  In sum, Defendants, individually and jointly, conspired and \nschemed to target Plaintiffs as Indian laborers, knowing that they \nwould be enticed by good pay and false promises of permanent \nresidency, to lure them into the United States. Furthermore, each \nDefendant,  individually  and  through  a  collaborative  enterprise \npremised upon fraud, mistreated Plaintiffs and deprived them of \nany benefit of a fair bargain. \n \n5 of 13 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 49   Filed 08/04/14   Page 6 of 13 PageID #:  804\n  In the RICO fraud chart attached to their complaint as Exhibit 1, the Plaintiffs also allege \nthe following occurred after the Plaintiffs arrived in the United States: \n  At periodic Signal camp meetings, Defendant Malvern C. \nBurnett told Plaintiff Mayavu and his co-workers repeatedly not to \nworry  about  their  green  cards.    Defendant  Burnett  also \nrepresented that he  was applying for H-2B visa extensions  for \nPlaintiff Mayavu and for others.  Subsequently, Plaintiff Mayavu \nand  his  co-workers  inquired  about  extensions  to  their  soon  to \nexpire  H-2B  visas.  Defendant  Signal  and  Defendant  Burnett \ninformed them that they were still on track to receive extensions, \nalthough they never received them. \n \n  The Plaintiffs have clearly alleged the Burnett Defendants were “key participants” in an \n“elaborate human trafficking scheme.”   (Doc. No. 21, p. 9.)   In their motion to dismiss, the \nBurnett Defendants argue that these facts are merely “occurrences and actions that are consistent \nwith any attorney representing his or her clients.”   (Doc. No. 11, p. 3.)  However, the Plaintiffs \nhave provided facts describing Burnett’s acts that are entirely inconsistent with a “normal” \nattorney-client relationship.    As stated above, Burnett allegedly made false promises to the \nPlaintiffs to lure them into working for Signal.   Burnett also required the Plaintiffs to pay him \nexorbitant fees for his services, and then refused to refund the Plaintiffs’ money when he failed \nto perform as promised.  (Doc. No. 1, p. 24.)       \n  Furthermore, the Plaintiffs have provided sufficient facts to support their argument that \nBurnett  is  liable  for  fraud  and  negligent  misrepresentation.   Under  Federal  Rule  of  Civil \nProcedure 9(b), “a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or \nmistake.  Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person’s mind may be alleged \ngenerally.”   As detailed above, Burnett made several promises to the Plaintiffs that he allegedly \nknew to be untrue: 1) the companies and/or entities that purportedly were sponsoring Plaintiffs’ \napplications were financially solvent and had reliable and stable employment opportunities to \n6 of 13 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 49   Filed 08/04/14   Page 7 of 13 PageID #:  805\nprovide the Plaintiffs; 2) green card applications sponsored by those companies would be valid \nand bona fide under U.S. immigration law; and 3) any applications were likely to be successfully \ncompleted and approved within the promised timelines.   (Doc. No. 1, p. 12.)   In reliance on \nBurnett’s promises, the Plaintiffs “relinquished stable employment opportunities in Singapore \nand India and borrowed substantial amounts of money” to work at Signal’s Orange, Texas \nfacility.   (Id., p. 2.)   \n  The Plaintiffs have also provided sufficient facts alleging that Burnett conspired with \nSignal.   More than once, in their complaint and the RICO chart attached to the complaint as \nExhibit 1, the Plaintiffs allege that the Burnett Defendants worked with the Recruiter Defendants \nand Signal to carry out this scheme.  The Plaintiffs identify letters and phone conversations \nshowing the Defendants conspired to: 1) recruit the Plaintiffs with false promises of permanent \nresidency for themselves and their families; and 2) keep the Plaintiffs from protesting their \nmistreatment and leaving Signal’s employ.    \n  Finally, Burnett generally states the Plaintiffs failed to allege facts to support their breach \nof  contract  claim.    (Doc.  No.  11,  p.  5.)    However,  the  Plaintiffs  allege  they  entered  into \ncontracts with Burnett under which they would pay fees to Burnett in exchange for his promise \nto provide them with lawful employment and work-authorized green cards enabling them to \npermanently and legally reside in the United States with their families.  (Doc. No. 1.)   Burnett \nallegedly breached this contract by not fulfilling those promises and refusing to refund the fees \nthe Plaintiffs paid him.  (Id., pp. 34-35.)   \n  2.   Involuntary Servitude \n  The Burnett Defendants also argue that “each of the federal causes of action has as its \nlinchpin the concept that threats of deportation satisfies the definition of involuntary servitude,” \n7 of 13 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 49   Filed 08/04/14   Page 8 of 13 PageID #:  806\nand “as a matter of law, the threat of deportation does not satisfy a determination of involuntary \nservitude.”  (Doc. No. 11, p. 2.)  The Burnett Defendants do not elaborate on how each of the \nPlaintiffs’ claims is based on the premise that threats of deportation satisfy the definition of \ninvoluntary servitude.    \n  Nonetheless, the case cited by Burnett in support of his assertion is easily distinguished \nfrom the instant case.   In Zavala v. Wal Mart Stores, the plaintiffs were “seeking compensation \nfor unpaid overtime and certification of a collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Act \n(FLSA), civil damages under RICO, and damages for false imprisonment.”   Zavala v. Wal Mart \nStores Inc., 691 F.3d 527, 530 (3d Cir. 2012).   The plaintiffs supported their RICO and false \nimprisonment claims on the theory that the defendants forced them into working by threatening \nto report their immigration status to the authorities.   Id. at 533.   The Court stated that “absent \nsome  special  circumstances,  threats  of  deportation  are  insufficient  to  constitute  involuntary \nservitude.”   Id. at 541.   However, unlike the instant case, in Zavala, Wal-Mart did not contract \ndirectly with the plaintiffs; the plaintiffs did not work exclusively for Wal-Mart and “often \nswitched jobs, freely moving to different employers in different cities;” and the plaintiffs were \nnot housed in labor camps.   Id.   In fact, the Zavala court asserted that “[m]odern day examples \nof involuntary servitude have been limited to labor camps, isolated religious sects, or forced \nconfinement.”   Id.  at  540.    In  the  instant  case,  the  Plaintiffs  allege  they  were  housed  in \n“overcrowded, unhygienic, and disease-ridden work camps resembling prisons” (Doc. No. 1, p. \n3.)  The “labor camp s” were allegedly “located in an isolated industrial area miles removed \nfrom shopping, places of worship, public transportation or residential communities.”  (Id., p. \n30.)    \n  Furthermore,  the  Supreme  Court  held  in  United  States  v.  Kozminski  that  “the \n8 of 13 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 49   Filed 08/04/14   Page 9 of 13 PageID #:  807\nvulnerabilities of the victim are relevant in determining whether the physical or legal coercion or \nthreats thereof could plausibly have compelled the victim to serve” involuntarily.   United States \nv. Kozminski, 487 U.S. 931, 952 (1988).   The Court further held that “a trial court could \nproperly find that evidence of . . . extremely poor working conditions is relevant to corroborate \ndisputed evidence regarding the use or threatened use of physical or legal coercion . . . .”   Id.  \nTherefore, a court must consider all of the relevant circumstances when determining whether the \nPlaintiffs  were  forced  to  serve  involuntarily.    In  their  complaint,  the  Plaintiffs  allege  the \nfollowing: \n  The  camps  were  enclosed  by  fences  and  accessible  to \nPlaintiffs only by a single, guarded entrance.   The gates at the \nlabor  camp  were  constantly  monitored  by  security  guards  who \nwere retained by Signal.  Upon information and belief, some or \nall of these guards may have been obtained by Signal through \nSwetman Security Service, Inc. (“Swetman Security”), a private \nsecurity company based in Mississippi.   Signal’s security guards \nmonitored  Plaintiffs’  arrival  and  departure  from  the  facility  by \nrequiring them to show their employee identification badges and \nrecording  the  times  at  which  Plaintiffs  entered  and  exited  the \ncamps.   If an employee lost his identification badge, he was not \nallowed to leave the camp.   Signal’s security guards also searched \nPlaintiffs’  packages  and  bags  when  they  entered  the  camps.  \nExcept on certain rare occasions, Plaintiffs were not permitted to \nreceive visitors in the labor camps at any time. \n  Up to 24 men were housed in each bunkhouse and made to \nsleep  in  two-tiered  bunk  beds.  The  bunk  beds  were  so  tightly \npacked in the bunkhouses that it was difficult for workers to move \nabout  in  the  narrow  passageways  between  the  bunks.   The \nbunkhouses also had insufficient toilet and bathing facilities for 24 \nmen, resulting in very long lines for the bathrooms before and after \nwork shifts.  Privacy in the bunks was non-existent.   Plaintiffs \noften  experienced  extreme  difficulty  with  sleeping  due  to  the \nconstant noise that resulted from workers entering and leaving the \nbunks at different times for different work shifts throughout the \nday and night. \n  Plaintiffs took their meals in Defendant Signal’s mess halls, \nwhich were only open during limited hours.   Due to unhygienic \nkitchen  conditions,  Plaintiffs’  coworkers  frequently  became  ill, \nsometimes  requiring  hospitalization.    Plaintiffs  routinely  went \n9 of 13 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 49   Filed 08/04/14   Page 10 of 13 PageID #:  808\nwithout dietary necessities such as daily servings of  fruits and \nvegetables, as a result of scarce resources in the kitchen. \n  Plaintiffs  also  were  exposed  to  a  work  environment  in \nwhich they were forced to endure a lack of safety precautions, \nunfavorable  job  assignments,  evaluation  processes,  and  other \nadverse employment actions to which non-Indian and U.S. citizen \nworkers were not similarly subjected. \n  In the isolated and guarded atmosphere of the labor camps, \ngrappling with the crushing debts they had incurred to come to the \nUnited States, and fearful of the perceived dangers that existed \noutside of their fenced-in housing site, Plaintiffs reasonably felt \nthat Signal’s statements were threatening and felt forced to live in \nthe bunkhouses and continue working for Signal, despite terrible \nliving and working conditions. \n \n  In light of these allegations, the undersigned finds the Plaintiffs have stated a plausible \nclaim of involuntary servitude.  Accordingly, the undersigned recommends that the court den y \nthe Burnet Defendants’ motion to dismiss on the basis that the Plaintiffs failed to state a plausible \nclaim. \n  B.  Statute of Limitations   \n  The Burnett Defendants also assert that the Plaintiffs’ pendent state law claims are time \nbarred by the statute of limitations.  Burnett argues the statute of limitations on the state law \nclaims began to run, at the latest, when the David case was filed on March 7, 2008.  Burnett \nsubmits that because the plaintiffs were putative class members in David, they were “necessarily \naware of all the facts” that would trigger the running of the statute of limitations.   (Doc. No. 11, \np. 7.)  Although Burnett does not catalogue the statute of limitations for each pendent state law \nclaim under Texas law, he claims they would expire, at the latest, in four years—2012.  The \ncomplaint in the instant case was filed in 2013.    Burnett also argues the federal class action filed \nin the David court, which was not certified, did not toll the running of the statute of limitations \non the state law claims.   In response, the Plaintiffs argue the David Court explicitly tolled the \nstatute of limitations on all of the Plaintiffs’ state law claims.  (Doc. No. 21, p. 18.)   In the \n10 of 13 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 49   Filed 08/04/14   Page 11 of 13 PageID #:  809\nalternative, they argue Texas law supports the tolling of the statute  of limitations as to all \npurported members of a class upon the filing of the class action.  (Id., p. 13.)    \nThe David complaint was filed on March 7, 2008.  (Doc. No. 11, Exh. 2.)  United \nStates District Judge Zainey, upon the consent of Signal and the Burnett Defendants, entered an \norder tolling the statute of limitations for the absent class members’ (who are the Plaintiffs in this \ncase) state law claims for 120 days until after the court’s final ruling on class certification.  \nOrder, Kurian David et al. v. Signal International, L.L.C., et al., No. 2:08-cv-1220 (E.D. La. Jan. \n20, 2011) (Doc. No. 982).   Judge Zainey entered an order denying class certification on January \n4, 2012, making the expiration of the tolling period May 3, 2012.   Order and Reasons, David, \nNo. 2:08-cv-1220 (Doc. No. 1117).   The case was subsequently transferred to United States \nDistrict Judge Susie Morgan.   Order Reassigning Case, David, No. 2:08-cv-1220 (Doc. No. \n1157).   Over Signal’s objection, Judge Morgan further tolled the statute of limitations for the \nPlaintiffs’ claims until August 28, 2013.  Order and Reasons, David, No. 2:08-cv-1220 (Doc. \nNo. 1379).  However, pursuant to Burnett’s request, Judge Mor gan clarified that prior order by \nstating it only tolled the limitations period for the federal law claims, not any state law claims.  \nOrder and Reasons, David, No. 2:08-cv-1220 (Doc. No. 1417). \nFor a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court is  typically not  to  look  beyond  the complaint.  \nHowever, a court may consider attachments to briefing regarding a motion to dismiss if the \ndocuments are referenced in the complaint, central to the complaint, referenced by the parties, \nand their authenticity is not in dispute.   See Walch v. Adjutant Gen. Dep’t, 533 F.3d 289, 293–\n94 (5th Cir. 2008) (citing In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. \n2007)); Causey v. Sewell Cadillac-Chevrolet, Inc., 394 F.3d 285, 288 (5th Cir. 2004).  Those \nare the only documents the undersigned should consider in deciding the motion to dismiss as it \n11 of 13 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 49   Filed 08/04/14   Page 12 of 13 PageID #:  810\nconcerns the limitations issue—not the various court orders entered by the New Orleans district \ncourts tolling state statutes of limitations for the pendent state law claims.2   \nNevertheless, even if the undersigned were to consider and apply Judge Zainey’s tolling \norder from the date the David complaint was filed until its expiration, the undersigned would still \nneed to go outside the pleadings to intelligently determine the appropriate accrual date for the \nvarious state law claims and what effect the tolling period from Judge Zainey’s order has on the \ntimeliness of the pendent state law claims filed in the instant complaint.3  Pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 12(d), “if on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) matters outside the pleadings \nare presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary \njudgment under Rule 56, and all parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present \nmaterial that is pertinent to the motion.”  Accordingly, to the extent the Burnett Defendants \nbelieve the Plaintiffs’ state law claims are still barred by the statute of limitations in light of \nJudge Zainey’s tolling order, that is a matter best addressed in a motion for summary judgment, \nafter the parties have had an opportunity for full discovery and the court can consider evidence \noutside the pleadings.         \nV.  Recommendation \n  For the reasons stated above, the Burnett Defendants’ “Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)” (Doc. No. 11) should be denied, subject to reconsideration in a motion \n                                         \n  2.  Burnett did not address the tolling orders entered by the  David court, and the Plaintiffs only mentioned \nJudge Morgan’s initial order tolling the statute of limitations for the state law claims, not the order clarifying that the \nprevious order only applied to the federal law claims.  It should be noted that Burnett filed the instant motion after \nJudge Zainey’s and Judge Morgan’s tolling orders, but before Judge Morgan’s order clarifying the previous order \nwas entered on October 14, 2013.  However, the Plaintiffs filed their response on November 15, 2013, after the \nclarification order was entered. \n  \n  3.  Burnett cites Bell v. Showa Denko K.K., 899 S.W.2d 749 (Tex. App. 1995) in support of his \nargument that Texas courts hold the filing of a proposed federal class action does not toll the limitations period on \npendent state law claims.  See also Newby v. Enron Corp., 542 F.3d 463 (5th Cir. 2008).  In those cases, it does \nnot appear the Defendants consented to the tolling of the statute of limitations, as the Burnett Defendants did here, at \nleast for the period of time reflected in Judge Zainey’s order.  As such, those cases appear to be inapposite. \n12 of 13 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 49   Filed 08/04/14   Page 13 of 13 PageID #:  811\nfor summary judgment that the state law claims are barred by the statute of limitations. \n \nVI.  Objections \n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(c) (Supp. IV 2011), each party to this action has the \nright to file objections to this report and recommendation.  Objections to this report must (1) be \nin writing, (2) specifically identify those findings or recommendations to which the party objects, \nand (3) be served and filed within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this \nreport.   See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(c); Fed R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2).  A party who objects to this \nreport is entitled to a de novo determination by the United States District Judge of those proposed \nfindings and recommendations to which a specific objection is timely made.   See 28 U.S.C. § \n636(b)(1)(c); Fed R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3).    \n  A party’s failure to file specific, written objections to the proposed findings of fact and \nconclusions of law contained in this report, within fourteen (14) days of being served with a copy \nof this report, bars that party from: (1) entitlement to de novo review by the United States District \nJudge of the findings of fact and conclusions of law, see Rodriguez v. Bowen, 857 F.2d 275, \n276–77 (5th Cir. 1988), and (2) appellate review, except on grounds of plain error, of any such \nfindings  of  fact  and  conclusions  of  law  accepted  by  the  United  States  District  Judge,  see \nDouglass v. United Servs. Auto. Ass’n, 79 F.3d 1415, 1428–29 (5th Cir. 1996).   \nSIGNED this 31st day of July, 2014.\n__________________________________________________\nZaacckk HHaawwtthhoorrnn\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n13 of 13 ",

Plaintiffs are part of a group of approximately 590 Indian men who were\ntrafficked into the United States in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina through the federal\ngovernment’s H-2B guest worker program to provide labor and services to Defendants Signal\nInternational, L.L.C., Signal International, Inc., Signal International Texas, L.P. and Signal\nInternational Texas, G.P. (collectively, “Signal” or the “Signal Defendants”). Recruited to\nperform welding, pipefitting, and other marine-fabrication work, Plaintiffs were subjected to\nforced labor and other abuses at Signal’s operations in Orange, Texas and Pascagoula,\n1\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 2 of 55 PageID #:  2\nMississippi.\n2. Plaintiffs bring this action to recover damages from Defendant Signal, as well as\nSignal’s recruiters and agents operatingin India and the United States. Defendants exploited and\ndefrauded Plaintiffs by recruiting them to work in the United States and effectuating a broad\nscheme of psychological coercion, threats of serious harm and threatened abuse of the legal\nprocess to procure and maintain Plaintiffs’ labor for the benefit of Signal. Plaintiffs were further\ndefrauded out of thousands of dollars in recruitment fees under the false promise that theywould\nreceivelong-term workandpermanent residencyintheUnitedStates.\n3. Enticedbypromises of relativelyhighwages (at $19USDperhour,plus overtime\npay), as well as permanent residency, Plaintiffs relinquished stable employment opportunities in\nSingapore and India and borrowed substantial amounts of moneyto take advantage of seemingly\npromising opportunities in the United States. Signal’s labor recruiters demanded between\n$10,000 and $20,000 USD in application fees, causing Plaintiffs to incur significant debts, post\ntheirfamilies’propertyas collateral,andjeopardizetheirfinancial security.\n4. Defendants’ main recruiting agent in India, Dewan Consultants, held Plaintiffs’\npassports and visas and threatened, coerced, and defrauded Plaintiffs into paying extraordinary\nfees for recruitment, immigration processing, and travel. This threatening, coercive, and\nfraudulent activity induced Plaintiffs into entering the United States to work for Signal.\nDefendants further caused Plaintiffs to believe that if Plaintiffs did not work for Signal under the\nauspices of temporaryH-2B guestworker visas, Plaintiffs would suffer abuse or threatened abuse\nofthelegal process,physical restraint,and/orotherserious harm.\n5. As seasonal guest workers, Plaintiffs were ineligible for permanent residency,\nwhich the Signal Defendants knew but fraudulently concealed from Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs,\n2\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 3 of 55 PageID #:  3\nhowever, believed what they were told by the Recruiter Defendants in India—that they could\nobtain permanent residency for themselves and for their families in the United States through\nworking for Signal. These false promises, collection of exorbitant recruiting fees, and strong-\narm tactics of Defendants Signal and/or its agents were, upon information and belief, authorized\nby Defendant Signal, which knew of these facts from the first Indian H-2B workers to arrive at\nits facilities in the United States as early as October 2006. Rather than taking any corrective\nmeasures to remedy the recruiting scheme perpetrated by the Recruiter Defendants in India,\nDefendant Signal ratified and perpetuated the scheme by continuing to facilitate the\ntransportationoffurther waves of IndianH-2Bworkers, includingPlaintiffs.\n6. Prior to arriving in the United States, Plaintiffs had been told that they could live\nin apartments or houses. This, however, was a far cry from the facilities in which they were\nrequired to live when they arrived in the United States—overcrowded, unhygienic, and disease-\nridden work camps resembling prisons. Defendant Signal’s armed guards surrounded the work\ncamps at all hours and regularly searched Plaintiffs upon their entry and exit. Moreover,\nPlaintiffs were shockedtodiscoverthat theywouldberequiredtosurrenderroughly$1,050USD\nper month to live in such conditions. When Plaintiffs asked about alternative housing, the Signal\nDefendants used economic coercion to force them to stay. As the Signal Defendants explained,\nif Plaintiffs were to move out of the work camps and reside elsewhere, Signal still would deduct\napproximately $1,050 USD per month from their paychecks for housing costs. Since Plaintiffs\ncould not afford to rent alternative housing and pay what would amount to double-rent, they had\nno choice but to remain in Signal’s labor camps and endure deplorable living conditions.\nPlaintiffs never knowingly agreed to this fixed, monthly payment regardless of whether or not\ntheylivedintheselabor camps, andtheywouldnot haveagreedtoit hadtheyunderstoodthis.\n3\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 4 of 55 PageID #:  4\n7. Defendant Signal also deceived Plaintiffs about their visa status repeatedly,\nthreatened that Plaintiffs could be deported at any moment, and perpetuated a campaign of\npsychological abuse, coercion, and fraud calculated to render Plaintiffs afraid, intimidated, and\nunable to leave Signal’s employ. Deeply indebted, fearful, isolated, and unfamiliar with their\nrights under United States law, Plaintiffs were compelled to continue working for Signal and\nregularlyfeareddeportationafterlearningthat theirtemporaryvisas hadexpired.\n8. In sum, Defendants, individually and jointly, conspired and schemed to target\nPlaintiffs as Indian laborers, knowing that theywould be enticed by good pay and false promises\nof permanent residency, to lure them into the United States. Furthermore, each Defendant,\nindividually and through a collaborative enterprise premised upon fraud, mistreated Plaintiffs\nanddeprivedthem ofanybenefit ofa fairbargain.\n9. As a result of these abuses, Plaintiffs are entitled to relief from Defendants under\nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (“TVPRA”), the Racketeer Influenced\nand Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”) and common law theories of fraud, negligent\nmisrepresentationandbreachof contract.\nJURISDICTIONAND VENUE\n10. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal\nquestionjurisdiction),18U.S.C.§1595(a)(civil trafficking)and18U.S.C. §1964(c)(RICO).\n11. This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over causes of action based on state law\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, as the state law claims arise out of the same nucleus of operative\nfacts that support thefederal claims.\n12. Venue in the Eastern District of Texas is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 in that a\nsubstantial portion of the communications, transactions, events or omissions underlying\n4\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 5 of 55 PageID #:  5\nPlaintiffs’ claims occurred in and around the vicinity of Orange, Texas, within this judicial\ndistrict.

Throughout the spring, summer, and fall of 2006, Defendant Dewan Consultants\nplaced advertisements in various Indian-language newspapers offering opportunities for welders\nandfitters toimmigrate permanentlytothe United States underthe auspices ofDefendant Signal,\nwhichit described as “aleadingmarine andfabricationcompanyinMississippi andTexas.”\n48. Defendant Dewan Consultants’ advertisements and other recruiting efforts were\nundertaken on behalf of, at the direction of, and/or in coordination and consultation with\nDefendant Signal.\n49. The advertisements placed by Defendant Dewan Consultants promised that\nqualified candidates could obtain green cards and thereby legally and permanently immigrate to\nthe United States with their families. The advertisements encouraged interested parties to travel\nto various locations throughout India to obtain additional information about the prospect of\nemployment withSignal intheUnitedStates.\n50. Upon information and belief, prior to conducting these informational sessions,\nDefendant Dewan Consultants, Defendant Signal, Defendant Pol and Defendant Burnett\n10\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 11 of 55 PageID #:  11\nconferred by phone, mail, fax and/or e-mail to organize, plan and coordinate the substantive\ncontent of the informational sessions. In the meantime, Defendant Dewan Consultants\ncommunicated with interested workers, including each of Plaintiffs, through telephone\nconversations, faxes and other written documents, informing them that in exchange for a\nrecruitment fee, theyand their families would be able to obtain permanent legal residence within\ntheUnitedStates.\n51. Through these communications, Defendant Dewan Consultants, personally and/or\nthrough its agents, representatives, and/or employees, represented to Plaintiffs that Defendant\nSignal was a stable and reputable U.S. company offering lawful and ample employment\nopportunities, that working under an H-2B visa for Signal was not inconsistent with applying for\npermanent immigration status sponsored by Signal, and that Signal would obtain for Plaintiffs\nwork-authorized green cards enabling Plaintiffs to permanently and legally reside in the United\nStates withtheirfamilies.\n52. Upon information and belief, at informational meetings and in telephone\nconversations, faxes, and other written documents transmitted in late 2006, Defendant Dewan\nConsultants, personally and/or through their agents, employees and/or representatives, told\nPlaintiffs that thegreencardprocess,once commenced,wouldbe completedbyJune31,2007.\n53. In these communications with Plaintiffs, Defendant Dewan Consultants further\npromised to act diligently and to do everything necessary to obtain green cards for Plaintiffs\nwithinthepromisedtimelines.\n54. Defendant Dewan Consultants, Defendant Signal, Defendant Pol and Defendant\nBurnett induced Plaintiffs to enter into employment agreements by falsely promising to help\nPlaintiffs obtain green cards. In actuality, Defendants lacked the intent to diligently pursue\n11\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 12 of 55 PageID #:  12\nPlaintiffs’ green card applications. Theyalso lacked anybasis whatsoever for representing, inter\nalia, that the companies and/or entities that purportedly were sponsoring Plaintiffs’ applications\nwere financially solvent and had reliable and stable employment opportunities to provide\nPlaintiffs, that green card applications sponsored by those companies would be valid and bona\nfide under U.S. immigration law, and that any applications were likely to be successfully\ncompletedandapproved withinthepromisedtimelines.\n55. In the second half of 2006, Defendant Dewan Consultants told Plaintiffs that if\nthey successfully completed three phases of employment screening, they would be hired by\nDefendant Signal and ultimately would be given green cards for permanent residency in the\nUnitedStates.\n56. The three-phase screening process required: (i) timely payment of a registration\nfee; (ii) successful completion of a consulate interview with the United States Consular Office;\nand (iii) passing a labor skills test administered by Defendant Signal and Defendant Dewan\nConsultants.\nRecruitment ofRaju Meganathan\n57. At the time the Recruiter Defendants’ advertisements appeared in local\nnewspapers, Plaintiff Meganathan was employed in Chennai, India, where he worked as a\nwelder. Plaintiff Meganathan was informed of the advertisement from a friend in India and\nattendedtheinformatorymeetingdescribedinthe advertisement.\n58. Defendant Dewan Consultants instructed Plaintiff Meganathan that to apply for\nemployment with Signal, he would be required to pay a registration fee of 760,000 Indian rupees\n(approximately $16,826 USD) that could be paid in installments and would be divided amongst\nthe Recruiter Defendants and Facilitator Defendants. Defendant Dewan Consultants informed\nPlaintiff Meganathan that this large sum of money amounted to a registration fee that would\n12\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 13 of 55 PageID #:  13\nenable Defendants Burnett and Pol to obtain a green card for him, which would enable his\npermanent residencywithintheUnitedStates.\n59. Plaintiff Meganathan was later told by Defendant Dewan Consultants that the\nregistration fee would be reduced to 600,000 rupees (approximately $13,398 USD). Defendant\nDewan Consultants instructed Plaintiff Meganathan that his first installment would be due after\npaying 2,000 rupees (approximately $44 USD) for skills testing. Plaintiff Meganathan was told\nfurther that his first installment was to be made in separate checks payable to Defendant Burnett\nand Defendant Pol, each in the amount of $1,428.57 USD and a cash payment of $1,461 USD to\nDefendant Dewanfor atotal of$4,318.04USD.\n60. In addition to the first installment, Plaintiff Meganathan was told that he would be\nrequiredto pay5,300 rupees (approximately$117 USD)inprocessingfees forthe U.S.consulate\nand 2,000 rupees (approximately $44 USD) for a medical exam in Chennai. Plaintiff\nMeganathan was told further that his last installment was to be made in separate checks payable\nto Defendant Burnett and Defendant Pol, each in the amount of $2,442 USD, as well as a cash\npayment of$3,542USD toDefendant Dewanfor atotal of$8,426USD.\n61. In addition to paying the recruiting fees, Plaintiff Meganathan also provided\npaperwork and his passport to Defendant Dewan Consultants. Defendant Dewan Consultants\ninformed Plaintiff Meganathan that it needed each of these items to schedule Plaintiff\nMeganathan’s consularinterview.\n62. In reasonable reliance upon Defendant Dewan Consultants’ explicit and repeated\npromises that he would receive a green card in exchange for paying the required recruiting fees,\nwhich would enable him and his family to obtain permanent residency, Plaintiff Meganathan\nundertook considerable economic, social, familial, and personal sacrifices to obtain the funds\n13\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 14 of 55 PageID #:  14\nnecessary to cover the fees. Plaintiff Meganathan and his family are of modest means and were\nforced to borrow most of the moneyneeded to payhis registration fee from lenders, who charged\nsignificant interest rates.\n63. Defendant Dewan Consultants further told Plaintiff Meganathan that he would not\nget his passport back until he came to Mumbai, India, and paid the rest of the registration fees.\nPlaintiff Meganathan’s conversation with Defendant Dewan Consultants caused him to\nreasonably believe that his passport would not be returned if he failed to make the remaining\npayments.\nRecruitment ofSaravanachlevan Narayanasamy\n64. At the time that Defendant Dewan Consultants issued its advertisements for work\nin the United States, Plaintiff Narayanasamy worked in Singapore as a pipefiter. Plaintiff\nNarayanasamy was informed of Defendant Dewan Consultants’ advertisement from a friend in\nIndia.\n65. Though Plaintiff Narayanasamy’s employment contract in Singapore was several\nyears from expiring, he returned to India to pursue the opportunity to work at Signal in the\nUnitedStates.\n66. Plaintiff Narayanasamy contacted Dewan Consultants by telephone in November\n2006 and was instructed to travel to Chennai, India, to attend an informational meetinghosted by\nDewanConsultants.\n67. Defendant Dewan Consultants instructed Plaintiff Narayanasamythat to applyfor\nemployment with Signal, he would be required to pay a registration fee that could be paid in\ninstallments and would be divided among the Recruiter Defendants and Facilitator Defendants.\nDefendant Dewan Consultants instructed Plaintiff Narayanasamy to pay an initial installment of\n35,000 rupees (approximately $782 USD), payable to Dewan Consultants, prior to participating\n14\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 15 of 55 PageID #:  15\nin skills testing and being interviewed by the United States Consular Office. Plaintiff\nNarayanasamymadethe payment as directed.\n68. Plaintiff Narayanasamy was told further that he would also be required to pay an\nadditional $10,746 USD to Defendants Burnett and Pol. This amount was to be divided equally\nand issued in two separate checks (each in the amount of $5,373 USD) made payable to\nDefendants Burnett and Pol. Defendant Dewan Consultants informed Plaintiff Narayanasamy\nthat this large sum of money amounted to a registration fee that would enable Defendants\nBurnett and Pol to obtain a green card for Plaintiff Narayanasamy leading to his permanent\nresidency within the United States. Indeed, the checks that Plaintiff Narayanasamy issued to\nDefendants Burnett and Pol eachstatedinthememoline“ProcessingFee forGreenCard.”\n69. In addition to paying the recruiting fees, Plaintiff Narayanasamy also provided\npaperwork and his passport to Defendant Dewan Consultants. Dewan Consultants informed\nPlaintiff Narayanasamy that it needed these items to schedule Plaintiff Narayanasamy’s consular\ninterview.\n70. In reasonable reliance upon Defendant Dewan Consultants’ explicit and repeated\npromises that he would receive a green card in exchange for paying the required recruiting fees,\nwhich would subsequently provide his family with a path to permanent residency, Plaintiff\nNarayanasamy undertook considerable economic, social, familial and personal sacrifices to\nobtain the funds necessary to cover the fees. Plaintiff Narayanasamy and his family are of\nmodest means and were forced to borrow most of the money needed to pay his registration fee\nfrom lenders chargingsignificant interest.\n71. Shortly after making the first half of the two installment payments totaling\n$10,746 USD to Defendants Burnett and Pol, Plaintiff Narayanasamy contacted Defendant\n15\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 16 of 55 PageID #:  16\nDewan Consultants via telephone to express doubts about his ability to make the remaining\npayment andtoseekthe returnofhis passport.\n72. A representative of Defendant Dewan Consultants refused to return Plaintiff\nNarayanasamy’s passport and, instead, coaxed him into remaining in the recruiting process by\nassuring him that he could “take his time” to assemble the money necessary to pay the second\ninstallment ofhis recruitingfee.\n73. Plaintiff Narayanasamy’s conversation with Defendant Dewan Consultants\ncaused him to reasonably believe that his passport would not be returned if he failed to make the\nremainingpayments.\nRecruitment ofSaravanan Ramasamy\n74. At the time Defendant Dewan Consultants’ advertisements appeared in local\nnewspapers, Plaintiff Ramasamy worked in Singapore as a pipefitter. Plaintiff Ramasamy was\ninformedofthe advertisements byafriendlivingin India.\n75. Though Plaintiff Ramasamy’s employment contract in Singapore was several\nyears from expiring, the prospect of working in the United States with Signal was too enticing\nnot to pursue. Plaintiff Ramasamy quit his job in Singapore and returned home to India to seek\nemployment throughDefendant DewanConsultants..\n76. In November of 2006, after returning home to India, another friend of Plaintiff\nRamasamy’s told him that Defendant Dewan Consultants was hosting an informational meeting\ninChennai, India.\n77. Plaintiff Ramasamy arrived at the meeting in Chennai and found himself in a\nwaitingroom crowded with dozens of other men also seekingemployment and a better life in the\nUnited States. Plaintiff Ramasamy waited in line for several hours before he met with a\nrepresentativefrom Defendant DewanConsultants.\n16\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 17 of 55 PageID #:  17\n78. Defendant Dewan Consultants instructed Plaintiff Ramasamy that to apply for\nemployment with Signal, he would be required to pay a registration fee that would be paid in\ninstallments and divided amongst the Recruiter Defendants and Facilitator Defendants.\nDefendant Dewan Consultants instructed Plaintiff Ramasamy that he must pay an initial\ninstallment of 35,000 rupees (approximately $794 USD) prior to participating in skills testing\nand being interviewed by the United States Consular Office, payable to Dewan Consultants.\nPlaintiffRamasamymadethepayment as directed.\n79. After paying the initial installment, Plaintiff Ramasamy was required to pay an\nadmission fee of 2,000 rupees (approximately$35 USD) in order to participate in the mandatory\nskills testingconductedbyDefendant DewanConsultants andDefendant Signal.\n80. In subsequent meetings with Defendant Dewan Consultants, Plaintiff Ramasamy\nwas told that he would also be required to payan additional $10,746 USD to Defendants Burnett\nand Pol. This amount was to be divided equally and issued in two separate checks (each in the\namount of $5,373 USD) made payable to Defendants Burnett and Pol. Defendant Dewan\nConsultants did not inform Plaintiff Ramasamy of the specific purpose of the payments, but he\nwas instructed to write “Processing Fee for Green Card” on the memo line of the checks issued\ntoDefendants Burnett andPol.\n81. In reasonable reliance upon Defendant Dewan Consultants’ explicit and repeated\npromises that he would receive a green card in exchange for paying the required recruiting fees,\nproviding him and his family with a path to permanent residency in the United States, Plaintiff\nRamasamy undertook considerable economic, social, familial and personal sacrifices to obtain\nthe funds necessary to cover the fees. Plaintiff Ramasamy’s parents, convinced by Defendant\nDewan Consultants’ promises to their son of a generous salary and opportunity in the United\n17\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 18 of 55 PageID #:  18\nStates, paid most of the registration fee by pawning their land, home, jewelry and other personal\nbelongings. The remainder of the fee was paid through a private loan from an acquaintance of\nPlaintiffRamasamy.\n82. Plaintiff Ramasamy made all of the payments mandated by Defendant Dewan\nConsultants. Despite Plaintiff Ramasamy’s requests, the Dewan Defendants refused to give him\nareceipt foranyofthepayments that hemade.\n83. In addition to paying the recruiting fees, Plaintiff Ramasamy also submitted\npaperwork and his passport to Defendant Dewan Consultants. Defendant Dewan Consultants\ninformed Plaintiff Ramasamy that they needed these items to schedule Plaintiff Ramasamy’s\ninterviewat theUnitedStates ConsularOffice.\n84. Though the United States Consulate returned Plaintiff Ramasamy’s passport to\nthe Dewan Defendants shortly after his successful completion of the consular interview,\nDefendant Dewan refused Plaintiff Ramasamy’s request to return his passport, stating that it was\n“best” if Defendant Dewan Consultants held onto his passport. Plaintiff Ramasamy reasonably\nbelieved that he had no choice other than to make the payments required by the Recruiter\nDefendants and to travel to the United States to work for Defendant Signal. In fact, Defendant\nDewan Consultants did not return his passport until after he paid the final installment of his\nregistrationfee—merehours beforehis departure fortheUnitedStates.\nRecruitment ofMaruthamuthu Mayavu\n85. Plaintiff Mayavu first heard about the job opportunitywith Defendant Signal after\nseeing an advertisement in a Tamil newspaper in early 2006. Friends in India also told him\nabout the job opportunity. Plaintiff Mayavu was working in Tamil Nadu, India, as a pipefitter at\nthetimehesawtheadvertisement.\n86. Plaintiff Mayavu called the phone number in the advertisement and spoke to an\n18\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 19 of 55 PageID #:  19\nemployee of Defendant Dewan Consultants, who directed him to attend a May 2006\ninformational meetingin Chennai, India,tolearn moreabout theworkopportunity.\n87. Plaintiff Mayavu attended the May 2006 meeting and was told by Defendant\nDewan Consultants that he would have to pay 600,000 rupees (approximately $13,284 USD) in\nrecruitment and visa processing fees, after which he would be cleared for a job with Defendant\nSignal and would be eligible for a green card and permanent residency in the United States.\nPlaintiff Mayavu was also told that his wage with Defendant Signal would be $22-25 USD per\nhour.\n88. After this meeting, Plaintiff Mayavu attended a skills test in Chennai, India, in\nJune 2006 which was held by employees of Defendant Dewan Consultants and Defendant\nSignal. Plaintiff Mayavu took and passed a written pipefittingtest and was told to attend another\nmeeting in Chennai, India, to make a down payment of 20,000 rupees (approximately $443\nUSD).\n89. In June 2006, Plaintiff Mayavu received a letter from Defendant Dewan\nConsultants informing him that he had been selected for employment with Defendant Signal and\nthat the “company shall proceed with your H2B Visa & Employment Based Permanent\nResidence Visa for United States of America.” The letter also instructed Plaintiff Mayavu to\nobtain two demand drafts for 66,700 rupees (approximately $1,430 USD) in the names of\nDefendants Burnett and Pol, respectively. Dated August 10, 2006, the memo line of these\nchecks read “visa.”\n90. Defendant Dewan Consultants informed Plaintiff Mayavu that he would not be\ngranted an interview at the United States Consular Office until the full 600,000 rupees was paid.\nIn reasonable reliance upon Defendant Dewan Consultants’ repeated promises that he would\n19\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 20 of 55 PageID #:  20\nreceive a green card in exchange for paying the required recruiting fees, Plaintiff Mayavu\nundertook considerable economic, social, familial, and personal sacrifices to obtain the necessary\nfunds. Because Plaintiff Mayavu and his family are of modest means, he had to borrow from\nmultiple sources to cover the registration payments. Plaintiff Mayavu had to pawn his family’s\nland and his wife’s jewelry and borrow from a friend in order to cover the total cost. Interest\nrates fortheseloans were as highas threepercent.\n91. Plaintiff Mayavu attended another meeting with Defendant Dewan Consultants at\nthe Park Hotel in Chennai, India, in August 2006. He was informed that he would have free\nroom and board at Signal’s worksite in the United States and that the companywould process his\ngreen card application after ten months of work. He was also told by Defendant Dewan\nConsultants that he would have to pay an additional 4,200 rupees ($93 USD) in visa fees before\nhis interview.\n92. Before Plaintiff Mayavu’s November 2006 U.S. Consulate interview, he met with\nDefendant Dewan Consultants for interview preparations. Defendant Dewan Consultants\ninstructed him to tell the consulate official that he intended to return to India on July 31, 2007.\nDefendant Dewan Consultants also told Plaintiff Mayavu to be sure that he did not mention the\n600,000 rupees in recruitment fees that he had paid them. Plaintiff Mayavu’s passport was\nretainedbythe consulate official aftertheinterview.\n93. After the consulate interview, Plaintiff Mayavu again met with Defendant Dewan\nConsultants, whotoldhim that hewould be clearedfor a U.S.visa,but that his passport had been\nretained andthat hewouldnot receiveit backuntil hehadmadeall his payments, whichincluded\nanother two demand drafts for $2,442 USD written out to Defendants Burnett and Pol. On\nNovember 18, 2006, Plaintiff Mayavu travelled to Mumbai, India, with these demand drafts in\n20\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 21 of 55 PageID #:  21\nhand. The memo line of these checks, dated November 16, 2006, read “employment based PR\nvisaforUSA.”\n94. At this last meeting in Mumbai, Defendant Dewan Consultants gave Plaintiff\nMayavu paperwork to sign for his forthcoming employment with Signal. The paperwork was all\nin English and Plaintiff Mayavu was only briefly told in his native tongue, Tamil, about the\ngeneral contents of the documents. He boarded a flight for the United States the next day,\nNovember19,2006.\nSuccessful Completion oftheConsulateInterview\n95. Plaintiffs were informed by Defendant Dewan Consultants that they needed to\nobtainH-2Bvisas toworkforSignal.\n96. The H-2B guest worker program permits U.S. employers to import foreign\nworkers on short-term temporary visas to meet labor needs when employers attest that they\ncannot obtainU.S.workers toperform thejobs that areavailable.\n97. H-2B visas, unlike green cards, are non-immigrant visas, are only valid for work\nwith the specific employer listed on the visa and do not provide portable and/or transferable\nemployment authorizationforthebearerofthevisa.\n98. Each of Plaintiffs was informed that obtaining H-2B visas would not interfere\nwiththeirgreen card applications.\n99. In order to secure H-2B visas, Plaintiffs were required to be interviewed by\nUnitedStates Consularofficers within Indian cities.\n100. These consular interviews necessitated that Plaintiffs pay the costs of travel from\ntheirhomes and/orcurrent places ofemployment toChennai, India.\n101. Defendant Dewan Consultants, acting as Defendant Signal’s agents, required that\nPlaintiffs meet withthem inthese Indiancities priortoattendingtheirconsularinterviews.\n21\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 22 of 55 PageID #:  22\n102. Prior to these meetings, upon information and belief, Defendant Dewan\nConsultants, Defendant Burnett and Defendant Pol discussed with Defendant Signal by e-mail,\ntelephone, and/or in-person communications the topics to be discussed and the instructions to be\ngiventoPlaintiffs at thesemeetings.\n103. At these pre-interview meetings, Defendant Dewan Consultants ensured that\nPlaintiffs wereup-to-date onpayingthe feeinstallments requiredbytheir greencard contracts.\n104. Defendant Dewan Consultants required Plaintiffs to sign documents permitting\nDefendant Dewan to receive their visa-stamped passports from the consulate on behalf of each\nPlaintiff.\n105. Defendant Dewan Consultants also instructed Plaintiffs as to what each should\nsayduringtheirconsular interviews.\n106. In particular, Defendant Dewan Consultants instructed Plaintiffs to not disclose\nthe fact that they had paid a fee to Defendant Dewan Consultants for the processing of their\ngreencards.\n107. Defendant Dewan Consultants told Plaintiffs that if they did not follow these\ninstructions regardingthe interviews, Plaintiffs wouldnot receivetheirvisas andwouldforfeit all\ninstallments previously paid to Defendants, in addition to losing their opportunity to immigrate\npermanentlytotheUnitedStates.\n108. In late 2006, after making their first installment payment, Plaintiffs were\ninstructed by Defendant Dewan Consultants to report to the U.S. Consulate Office for interviews\nas aprerequisitetoobtainingH-2Bvisas.\n109. Plaintiffs completed their consular interviews, and were informed that they had\nbeenawarded H-2Bvisas.\n22\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 23 of 55 PageID #:  23\n110. During Plaintiffs’ consular interviews, the Consular officials were in possession\nofPlaintiffs’passports.\n111. Once Plaintiffs’ visas were approved, Consular officials sent their passports, with\nH-2Bvisas affixed,directlytoDefendant Dewan Consultants.\n112. After receiving word that Plaintiffs’ visas had been approved, Defendant Dewan\nConsultants madetravel arrangements forPlaintiffs’trips totheUnitedStates.\n113. In late May and early June of 2006, the Facilitator Defendants filed with the\nMississippi Department of Employment Security, the Texas Workforce Commission, and the\nUnited States Department of Labor—bymail, electronic transmission and/or fax—the completed\nforms ETA 750 and attachments seekingpermission to import and hire 590 foreign guestworkers\nunder the auspices of 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b), attendant regulations 8 C.F.R. §\n214.2(h)(6) and 20 C.F.R. § 655.3 and associated administrative letters and/or guidance\n(commonlyknown as “theH-2B guestworkerprogram”)onbehalfof Defendant Signal.\n114. Knowing that Signal’s labor need was projected to be for at least two to three\nyears, the Facilitator Defendants and Defendant Signal stated in these applications to the state\nworkforce commissions and forms ETA 750 that Signal would employ workers from the period\nof October 1, 2006 to July 31, 2007. These applications were furnished with signatures by\nSignal executives swearing, under penalty of perjury, to the veracity of the information in these\napplications.\n115. Defendant Signal sought these workers to perform various jobs essential to its\nmarinefabricationservices business,includingweldingandpipefitting.\n116. Defendant Signal stated in the ETA 750 forms that its need for H-2B\nguestworkers was “peak load and a one-time occurrence” and that “the temporary workers will\n23\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 24 of 55 PageID #:  24\nworkforthe lengthoftheprescribeddates ofneed,will bepaidinaccordancewiththeprevailing\nwageand will returntotheirhomecountryat the endofemployment.”\n117. In the ETA 750 forms, Defendant Signal named the Facilitator Defendants as its\nagents for the purposes of preparing and submitting these applications to import H-2B\nguestworkers. The Facilitator Defendants prepared and submitted these applications on behalf of\nSignal.\n118. At the time of filing the ETA 750 forms and attachments with the Mississippi\nDepartment of Employment Security, the Texas Workforce Commission, and the United States\nDepartment of Labor, Defendant Signal and the Facilitator Defendants knew that Signal\nprojected the labor need that it sought to fill with foreign workers to be for at least two to three\nyears.\n119. At or around the time Defendant Signal and Facilitator Defendants filed the ETA\n750 forms in May and June 2006, they repeatedly communicated by telephone, mail, e-mail,\nand/or fax to direct and coordinate recruitment of Indian workers to fill the anticipated H-2B\nguestworker jobs. Upon information and belief, Defendant Signal and/or Facilitator Defendants\nrepeatedly communicated with Recruiter Defendants by telephone, mail, e-mail, and/or fax to\ndirect and coordinate recruitment of Indian workers to fill the anticipated H-2B guestworker\njobs.\n120. Upon information and belief, in the course of telephone, fax, e-mail and/or mail\ncommunications occurring in the second half of 2006, Defendant Signal authorized Defendant\nDewan Consultants to act as its agent in India for the purposes of recruiting Indian welders and\npipefitters to fill the anticipated H-2B guestworker jobs at Signal’s facilities in Texas and\nMississippi.\n24\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 25 of 55 PageID #:  25\n121. Upon information and belief, in the course of these communications, Defendant\nSignal further authorized Recruiter Defendants and Facilitator Defendants to represent that\nSignal would assume sponsorship of the pending and as-yet unsuccessful green card applications\nonbehalfof, amongothers, Plaintiffs Narayanasamy,Ramasmay,Mayavu andMeganathan.\n122. Defendant Signal authorized its agents to make these representations even though\nit kneworhadreason to knowthat suchvisa extensions andgreencardapplications wouldnot be\nbona fide and valid under United States immigration law. Moreover, Defendant Signal\nauthorized its agents to make these misrepresentations even though it did not have the intention\nat that time to applyfor such visa extensions and/or green cards on behalf of all of the Indian H-\n2Bworkers, includingPlaintiffs.\n123. Plaintiffs would not have paid the exorbitant fees charged by Defendant Dewan\nConsultants for travel, green cards, visas and work opportunities had they known that\nDefendants’promises andrepresentations werefalse.\nTheLaborSkills Test\n124. At various times during the spring, summer and fall of 2006, employees of\nDefendant Signal traveled to various locations in India and tested the pipefitting skills of\nPlaintiffs Narayanasamy, Ramasamy, Mayavu and Meganathan in anticipation of employing\nthem intheUnitedStates.\n125. Plaintiffs paid the costs necessary to travel to the facilities where these tests were\nheld.\n126. Plaintiffs Ramasamy and Meganathan were required to pay a 2,000-rupee\nadmissionfeefortheskills test.\n127. Plaintiffs attended and passed these tests, which were overseen and graded by\nDefendant Signal’s and/orDefendant Dewan’s agents, employees and/orrepresentatives.\n25\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 26 of 55 PageID #:  26\n128. Upon information and belief, prior to attending these meetings and testing\nsessions, Defendant Dewan Consultants, Defendant Signal, Defendant Pol and Defendant\nBurnett communicated in the second half of 2006 by phone, mail, fax and or e-mail to organize,\nplan,andcoordinatethelogistics andsubstantivecontent ofthesetestingsessions.\nPreparations for Departurefrom IndiaandArrival at Signal Operationsin theUnitedStates\n129. On or about July20, 2006, and August 17, 2006, the United States Department of\nLabor approved Signal’s labor certification applications for 590 H-2B workers for the period of\nOctober1,2006,through July31,2007.\n130. In approving these labor certification applications, the United States Department\nof Laborrelieduponthe accuracyoftheapplications’stated10-monthperiodoflaborneed.\n131. Upon information and belief, the Department of Labor is prohibited byits internal\nguidelines to grant labor certification applications without relying upon the application’s\nstatement oftemporarylaborneed.\n132. In late August and early September 2006, the United States Citizenship and\nImmigration Service (“USCIS”) approved Signal’s H-2B visa petitions for590 H-2B workers for\ntheperiodofOctober1, 2006,throughJuly31,2007.\n133. In approving these visa petitions, the USCIS relied upon the accuracy of the\npetitions’ stated 10-month period of labor need and the representation that Defendant Signal’s\nneedwas basedonaone-time,peak-loadtemporarydemand.\n134. The USCIS must, according to regulation, rely upon the stated period of the\npetitioner’s laborneed. See8C.F.R.§214.2(h)(6)(ii)(B).\n135. Defendant Signal, the Facilitator Defendants and the Recruiter Defendants knew\nthat the stated period of need in Signal’s applications for labor certifications and for H-2B visas\nwere inconsistent with Signal’s projected actual labor need. Therefore, Defendants knew that\n26\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 27 of 55 PageID #:  27\neachofthesestatements madetothe government was false.\n136. The Recruiter Defendants and the Facilitator Defendants used the H-2B visas that\nwere obtained from the U.S. Government—on the basis of false statements by Defendant Signal\nand the Facilitator Defendants—to elicit payments of the second and/or third installment from\nPlaintiffs.\n137. Plaintiffs entered the United States on H-2B guestworker visas, issued bythe U.S.\nGovernment on the basis of false statements by Defendant Signal, the Facilitator Defendants and\nthe Recruiter Defendants, in late 2006 and early2007 for the purposes of working for Defendant\nSignal at its Pascagoula, Mississippi,andOrange, Texas, facilities.\n138. Aroundthetime ofUSCIS’s visaapproval,Plaintiffs made necessarypreparations\nfor travel to the United States on their H-2B visas for purposes of working for Signal. These\npreparations included and were not limited to: (i)paying to obtain necessary travel and legal\ndocuments; (ii)making payments to the U.S. Consulate, Recruiter Defendants, and Facilitator\nDefendants for mandatory H-2B visa and consular processing fees; (iii) attending H-2B visa\ninterviews; and(iv)payingRecruiterDefendants fortravel arrangements.\n139. Once Plaintiffs’ H-2B visas were formallyapproved and all Plaintiffs passed their\nlabor skills tests, Defendant Dewan Consultants made arrangements for their personal travel to\ntheUnitedStates.\n140. Before Plaintiffs could leave for the United States, however, theywere required to\nattendfinal meetings inDefendant DewanConsultants’officeinMumbai, India.\n141. These meetings took place mere hours before Plaintiffs Narayanasamy,\nRamasamy, Mayavu and Meganathan were scheduled to depart to the United States. At this\ntime, Defendant Dewan Consultants’ office was teeming with anxious fellow Indian workers\n27\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 28 of 55 PageID #:  28\nawaitingdeparturetothe UnitedStates.\n142. At these meetings, Defendant Dewan Consultants collected final installment\npayments requiredbyPlaintiffs’agreement withDefendant DewanConsultants.\n143. Defendant Dewan Consultants refused to return Plaintiffs’ passports, which were\nin Defendant Dewan’s possession since after Plaintiffs’ H-2B visas were approved by U.S.\nConsular officials, until after Plaintiffs had paid the final installments and signed the mandatory\npaperwork.\n144. Knowingthat Plaintiff Narayanasamyonlyhad a few hours to make his scheduled\nflight to the United States, Defendant Dewan Consultants demanded that Plaintiff Narayanasamy\nquickly sign mandatory documents, written only in English, without providing him an\nopportunitytoreviewandunderstandtheircontents.\n145. Without possession of their passports and within this intentionally rushed and\nhostile atmosphere, Plaintiffs had no reasonable opportunity to review, understand, negotiate,\nand/or make any changes to the documents presented to them. Moreover, all the paperwork was\nin English. Only after all remaining installments were paid and all paperwork was signed were\nPlaintiffs told, in their native tongues, the general contents of the documents. Plaintiffs speak\nonly basic conversational English and could not read or understand the complex English-\nlanguagedocuments that wereprovidedtothem.\n146. Plaintiffs felt compelled to agree to Signal’s terms, despite the fact that they were\nunable to comprehend the terms to which they were agreeing, in part because they understood\nthat Signal would pay them at a rate of $19 USD per hour for 40 hours per week, plus time-and-\na-half (approximately $28.5 USD per hour) for overtime of up to 20 additional hours per week.\nSince Plaintiffs did not understand that that $1,050 USD would be deducted from their salaryper\n28\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 29 of 55 PageID #:  29\nmonth for housing costs, or that they would be required to endure unhygienic and prison-like\nliving conditions, they believed that the salary, along with eventual green cards, promised to\nthem by Signal outweighed the fact that they understood very little information concerning the\nnatureoftheir employment at thetime.\n147. Based on Defendant Dewan Consultants’ threatening and coercive behavior\nduringthesepre-departuremeetings inMumbai, andbasedupon the extraordinaryandincreasing\nlevels of debt that they had incurred to pay the Defendants Dewan Consultants, Burnett, and Pol\nfor their green-card and H-2B visa arrangements, Plaintiffs reasonably believed that they had no\nchoice other than to make the required payments and to travel to the United States to work for\nDefendant Signal.\n148. At the time of Plaintiffs’ hiring and departure, Defendant Signal was staffing\nIndian workers at its facilities inPascagoula,Mississippi,andOrange,Texas.\n149. Plaintiff Ramasamy was given a choice of working either at Signal’s Pascagoula\nfacilityorits Orange facilitybeforedeparting, and heselectedtheOrangefacility.\n150. Plaintiff Ramasamyflew to Houston, Texas, with approximately20 other workers\nonJanuary31,2007,via layovers in Londonand NewYork.\n151. Plaintiff Narayanasamy flew to Houston, Texas, on January 24, 2007, without\nknowinghis assignedSignal facility.\n152. Plaintiff Meganathan flew to Houston, Texas, with approximately 30 other\nworkers onDecember11,2006,vialayovers inNewYork andAtlanta.\n153. Plaintiff Mayavu flew to Mobile, Alabama, with other Indian workers on\nNovember19,2006,vialayovers inNewYork andAtlanta.\n154. Upon arrival in Houston, Texas, and Mobile, Alabama, Plaintiffs were greeted by\n29\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 30 of 55 PageID #:  30\nrepresentatives from Defendant Signal.\n155. The representatives divided the workers into two groups and assigned them to two\nseparate buses. One bus departed for Pascagoula, Mississippi, while the other departed for\nOrange,Texas.\n156. When Plaintiff Narayanasamy arrived in Houston and was sorted by the Signal\nrepresentatives, helearnedforthefirst timethat he hadbeen assignedtothe facilityinOrange.\nConditions at theSignal Facilities inOrange,Texas\nTheCampWas “LikeaPrison”\n157. Defendant Signal’s labor camps were located in isolated, industrial areas miles\nremoved from shopping areas, places of worship, or residential communities. The camps were\nenclosedbyfences andaccessibletoPlaintiffs onlybyasingle, guarded entrance.\n158. At certaintimes duringtheweek, aneight-passengervanmaderound-trip voyages\nto Wal-Mart. However, Defendant Signal required the van to be completely full before\ndeparture. Therefore,Plaintiffs hadnopractical abilitytotravel outsideof thecampat will.\n159. The gates at the labor camp were constantly monitored by security guards who\nwere retained by Defendant Signal. Upon information and belief, some or all of these guards\nmay have been obtained by Defendant Signal through Swetman Security Service, Inc.\n(“SwetmanSecurity”),a privatesecuritycompanybasedinMississippi.\n160. Signal’s security guards monitored Plaintiffs’ arrival and departure from the\nfacility by requiring them to show their employee identification badges and recording the times\nat which Plaintiffs entered and exited the camps. If an employee lost his identification badge, he\nwas not allowedtoleave thecamp.\n161. Signal’s security guards also searched Plaintiffs’ packages and bags when they\nenteredthe camps.\n30\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 31 of 55 PageID #:  31\n162. Defendant Signal’s personnel and/or security guards also conducted surprise\nsearches of the cramped and overcrowded bunkhouse trailers, which included searches of\nPlaintiffs’personal belongings.\n163. Upon information and belief, Defendant Signal’s security guards were present\nonly to protect Defendant Signal, not to protect Plaintiffs. This was readily apparent to\nPlaintiffs.\n164. Except on certain rare occasions, Plaintiffs were not permitted to receive visitors\ninthelaborcamps at anytime.\nDiseaseandMalnutrition\n165. Up to 24 men were housed in each bunkhouse and made to sleep in two-tiered\nbunk beds. The bunk beds were so tightly packed in the bunkhouses that it was difficult for\nworkers tomove about inthenarrowpassageways betweenthebunks.\n166. The tightly-packed bunks also facilitated the spread of disease, causing Plaintiff\nNarayanasamyandhis bunkmates tobecomesick onmultipleoccasions.\n167. The bunkhouses also had insufficient toilet and bathing facilities for 24 men,\nresultinginverylonglines forthebathrooms beforeandafterworkshifts.\n168. Privacy in the bunks was non-existent. Plaintiffs often experienced extreme\ndifficultywith sleeping due to the constant noise that resulted from workers entering and leaving\nthebunks at different times fordifferent workshifts throughout thedayand night.\n169. Plaintiffs took their meals in Defendant Signal’s mess halls, which were only\nopen during limited hours. Due to unhygienic kitchen conditions, Plaintiffs’ coworkers\nfrequentlybecameill,sometimes requiringhospitalization.\n170. Plaintiff Meganathan lost a significant amount of weight due to the food offered\nat Signal’s mess hall. Like many Indians, Plaintiff Meganathan had strict, religious dietary\n31\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 32 of 55 PageID #:  32\nrestrictions that prevented him from eating pork, which made up the majority of dinners at the\nSignal camp.\n171. Plaintiffs routinely went without dietary necessities such as daily servings of\nfruits andvegetables, as aresult ofscarceresources inthekitchen.\nSignal ChargedEach ofPlaintiffs Approximately$1,050USDEach Month\ntoLivein InhumaneConditions\n172. Defendant Signal deducted labor-camp fees of approximately $35 USD per day\n(or $245 USD per week, or approximately $1,050 USD per month) from Plaintiffs’ paychecks\nforthesubstandardlivingaccommodations and meals that Plaintiffs endured.\n173. Plaintiffs netted very little money after Defendant Signal made its deductions\nfrom Plaintiffs’paychecks forhousingandmeals.\n174. Plaintiffs did not understand that housing and meal expenses would be deducted\nfrom their salary until they received their first paychecks. Plaintiffs never knowingly authorized\nthesedeductions.\n175. Eventually, despite the fear of being punished for doing so, Plaintiffs complained\nand asked to live outside of the labor camps. Defendant Signal initially refused their request and\nsubsequently told the workers that if they tried to live outside the camps, Signal still would\ndeduct the full labor-camp fees from Plaintiffs’ wages. As a result, Plaintiffs, still burdened by\nthe debt they had incurred to pay the fees associated with their green card contracts, reasonably\nfelt that theyhadnochoiceotherthanto continue livingintheSignal camps.\nPlaintiffs ExperiencedOther Discrimination bySignal andits Employees DuetoTheir Race,\nEthnicity,Religion,andAlienage\n176. Defendant Signal only housed Indian H-2B workers, like Plaintiffs, in its labor\ncamps, which were referred to by Signal employees and management as the “reservation(s).”\nUpon information and belief, workers of non-Indian descent were neither required nor allowed to\n32\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 33 of 55 PageID #:  33\nliveinand/orpayforlivingaccommodations at Defendant Signal’s laborcamps.\n177. Defendant Signal subjected Plaintiffs to skills testing and re-testing and\npersistently threatened Plaintiffs with on-the-job discipline, layoffs, and periods without work\nand pay. Plaintiffs also were exposed to a work environment in which they were forced to\nendure a lack of safetyprecautions, unfavorable job assignments, evaluation processes, and other\nadverse employment actions to which non-Indian and U.S. citizen workers were not similarly\nsubjected.\n178. Plaintiff Meganathan was terminated on June 20, 2007, because he received an\naverage performance rating of “5” on a performance evaluation to which he was never told he\nwould be subjected while still in India. Upon information and belief, these sudden “performance\nevaluations”wereimplementedbySignal—after Plaintiffs arrivedintheUnitedStates andbegan\nworking—as a pretext to cutting its workforce to avoid fulfilling its promise to Plaintiffs to help\nthem obtain green cards. Although a rating of “6” would have been a passing score, Plaintiff\nMeganathan’s average was lowered to a “5” because he received a rating of “2” for safety.\nPlaintiff Meganathan disagrees with Defendant Signal’s performance rating and believes that the\nscorewas not objective, andwas, at least tosomedegree,discriminatory.\n179. Signal personnel and management regularly threatened Plaintiffs and other H-2B\nworkers that if they did not continue working for Signal, or did not work according to Signal’s\nrigidterms, Plaintiffs and other IndianH-2Bworkers wouldbedeportedbackto India.\n180. Signal personnel and management also told Plaintiffs that if theyventured outside\nofthelaborcamptheywerelikelytobe“shot for theirmoney.”\n181. Signal personnel and management further told Plaintiffs that if they left the labor\ncamp and encountered trouble with law enforcement, they would likely be deported, and that\n33\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 34 of 55 PageID #:  34\nDefendant Signal would beunabletoassist them.\n182. In the isolated and guarded atmosphere of the labor camps, grappling with the\ncrushing debts they had incurred to come to the United States, and fearful of the perceived\ndangers that existed outside of their fenced-in housingsite, Plaintiffs reasonablyfelt that Signal’s\nstatements were threatening and felt forced to live in the bunkhouses and continue working for\nSignal,despiteterriblelivingandworkingconditions.\n183. Plaintiffs’ continuing dependence upon Defendant Signal for their present and\nfuture immigration status and their continuing high levels of indebtedness, along with the prison-\nlike living conditions that theyhad been exposed to at Signal’s Orange and Pascagoula facilities,\nreasonablycaused Plaintiffs to fear serious harm and/or abuse of the legal process if theywere to\nleaveSignal’s employ.\n184. Under these circumstances, Plaintiffs reasonably felt like they had no choice but\ntocontinueworkingfor Signal undertheseconditions.\nTheDefendants’FalsePromisetoHelpPlaintiffs Get Green Cards Comes toLight\n185. At various times relevant to Plaintiffs’ claims, Defendant Signal refused to\nconfirm whether valid H-2B visa extensions had, in fact, been obtained for Plaintiffs. This\ncoerced Plaintiffs to continue working for Signal in the hope that Signal would finally resolve\ntheiruncertainimmigration statuses.\n186. On multiple occasions, Plaintiffs asked the Orange camp manager, who was\nknown as “Ravi,” about the statuses of their green cards. Ravi, an agent of Defendant Signal,\nalways told Plaintiffs that they had to wait without giving them any further updates or\ninformation.\n187. Since first contracting with Defendants in India, Plaintiffs have yet to receive\nfrom Defendants the green cards that Defendants promised them. Despite clear contractual\n34\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 35 of 55 PageID #:  35\nprovisions requiring them to do so, Defendant Dewan Consultants, Defendant Pol, Defendant\nBurnett and Defendant Signal have refused to refund any of the Plaintiffs’ money, which was\npaid to Defendants for the express purpose of processing and obtaining green cards and visas for\nPlaintiffs, as Defendants hadpromised.\nConditions at theSignal Facilities inPascagoula, Mississippi\n188. PlaintiffMayavubegan workinPascagoulainNovember2006.\n189. As Defendant Signal had done in Orange, Texas, it constructed a cramped,\nunhygienic, and remote labor camp in Pascagoula, Mississippi, specifically to house Plaintiffs\nandothersimilarly-situated IndianH-2BSignal workers.\n190. Similar to Plaintiffs’ thoughts upon arrival at Defendant Signal’s Orange, Texas,\ncamp, Plaintiff Mayavu’s first impression of the Pascagoula labor camp was that it more closely\nresembledaplacetohouseanimals ratherthanhumans.\n191. Upon entering the trailer “bunkhouses,” Plaintiff Mayavu was shocked to\ndiscover that he would be housed in cramped bunkhouses overflowing with dozens of fellow\nIndian H-2Bworkers.\n192. Plaintiff Mayavu had never been forced to share living quarters with more than\nthree or four other people at a time, even in India, and he was dismayed about how his new life\nintheUnitedStates was starting.\n193. Similar to Defendant Signal’s Orange, Texas, labor camp, the bunk beds in the\ntrailers were packed so close together at the Pascagoula camp that it was difficult for the Indian\nworkers livingtheretomove,let alonehaveanyprivacy.\n194. Due to multiple work shifts, workers were constantly entering and exiting the\ncrowded bunkhouses, making it extremely difficult for Plaintiff Mayavu to sleep at any time of\n35\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 36 of 55 PageID #:  36\ndayornight.\nUnhygienic,Disease-Ridden LivingConditions\n195. Given the close quarters and the lack of adequate toilet and shower facilities, the\ntrailers were highly unsanitary, and sickness, infection and disease spread rampantly. Similar to\nconditions at the Orange labor camp, dozens of men were forced to share only four showers and\ntwotoilets, andoftenwaitedinlonglines tousethesefacilities.\n196. Plaintiff Mayavu developed a groin infection due to the unhygienic conditions at\nthe Pascagoula labor camp. He was forced to paydoctors’ fees out-of-pocket because Defendant\nSignal providedinsufficient healthcarecoverage.\n197. Plaintiff Mayavu took meals in Defendant Signal’s mess halls, which were only\nopen during limited hours. Due to unhygienic kitchen conditions, Plaintiffs frequently became\nill, sometimes requiringhospitalization. Like manyIndians, Plaintiff Mayavu is a vegetarian and\noften found that Signal’s meal options did not accommodate his dietaryneeds. On one occasion,\nhewas hospitalizedforseverediarrhearesultingfrom thefoodservedbyDefendant Signal.\nArmedGuards,Deportation Threats, andForcedDetention\n198. Similar to the facilities at the Orange labor camp, the Pascagoula camp included\non-sitesecurityguards retainedbyDefendant Signal.\n199. PlaintiffMayavuwas constantlymonitoredbythese guards, who closelyobserved\nhis arrival and departure. Plaintiff Mayavu was required to show his employee identification\nbadgeeachand everytimeheenteredSignal’s Pascagoulacamp.\n200. Upon information and belief, Defendant Signal’s security guards were there to\nprotect Defendant Signal,not toprotect PlaintiffMayavuoranyoftheother Indianworkers.\n201. Signal personnel and management regularly threatened Plaintiff Mayavu and\nother Indian H-2B workers that if they did not continue working for Signal, and did not work\n36\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 37 of 55 PageID #:  37\naccordingtoSignal’s terms, theywouldimmediatelybefired and/ordeportedbackto India.\n202. On one occasion, Plaintiff Mayavu was hospitalized after an allergic reaction to\nsmoke at the jobsite, causing him to take a day off from work to recover. Plaintiff Mayavu’s\nforemanthreatenedtofirehim forthis timeawayfrom thejob.\n203. Plaintiff Mayavu took these threats seriously, in part because of a frightening\nincident in March 2007 when armed guards stormed into the trailers looking for five fellow H-\n2B Indian workers who were particularly vocal in complaining about the living conditions and\nwho demanded answers to immigration questions. One worker, Sabulal, often voiced all the\nIndian H-2B workers’ complaints, including those of Plaintiff Mayavu, when he repeatedly\naskedabout visaextensions andgreen cards.\n204. At 5:00 a.m. one morning, Plaintiff Mayavu watched these armed guards round\nup Sabulal and four other Indian H-2B workers and lock them up before preparing to fire and\ndeport them. Realizing that he was about to be deported back to India, Sabulal attempted to\ncommit suicide by slitting his wrists. Plaintiff Mayavu saw blood all over the facility and\nwitnessedSabulal beingtakenawayinanambulance.\nTheDefendants’FalsePromisetoHelpPlaintiffMayavu Get A Green Card\nComes toLight\n205. ThoughPlaintiffMayavu felt helpless andscared beforetheincident with Sabulal,\nhe was outright terrified afterwards. Nevertheless, he did not know what other choice he had\nother than to continue to work for Signal, especially considering his significant debt and his\nbelief that Defendant Signal would do what it promised and obtain a green card for him.\nPlaintiff Mayavu remarked that he had so much debt that he felt like a slave while he was\nworkingforSignal.\n206. Plaintiff Mayavu’s continued dependence upon Defendant Signal for his present\n37\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 38 of 55 PageID #:  38\nand future immigration status and his continued high levels of indebtedness reasonably led him\nto fear abuse of the legal process, including, but not limited to, deportation, if he tried to leave\nSignal’s employ. Moreover, after the incident with Sabulal, Plaintiff Mayavu also began to\nreasonablyfearserious bodilyharm ifheattemptedtoleaveSignal’s employ.\n207. Plaintiff Mayavu had no idea how to get another job in the United States, nor did\nheunderstandhow changingjobs might affect his immigrationstatus.\n208. Under these circumstances, Plaintiff Mayavu reasonably believed that he had no\nchoiceotherthantocontinueworkingforSignal.\n209. At various times relevant to Plaintiff Mayavu’s claims, Defendant Signal refused\ntoconfirm whether avalidH-2Bvisa extensionhad,infact,beenobtained forhim. This coerced\nhim to continue working for Signal in the hope that Signal would finally resolve his uncertain\nimmigrationstatus.\n210. The Pascagoula camp manager, “Rhonda,” an employee and agent of Defendant\nSignal, often ignored Plaintiff Mayavu’s inquiries about his immigration status and immigration\ndocuments.\n211. After completing approximately 16 months at the Pascagoula facility, Plaintiff\nMayavu and several other Indian H-2B workers finallyrealized that Signal would not be offering\nthem the promised green cards. Knowing this, and knowing they would face severe financial\nand personal consequences for doing so, Plaintiff Mayavu and other Indian H-2B workers\ndecidedtoquit ratherthanendureanotherdayofabuses at thehands ofSignal.\n212. Plaintiff Mayavu never received from Defendants the green card that Defendants\npromised him. Despite clear contractual provisions requiring them to do so, Defendant Dewan\nConsultants, Defendant Pol, Defendant Burnett and Defendant Signal have not refunded any of\n38\n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 39 of 55 PageID #:  39\nPlaintiff Mayavu’s money, which was paid to Defendants for the express purpose or processing\nandobtaininga greencardandvisaforhim,as Defendants hadpromised.\nFIRST CLAIM FORRELIEF\nTHETRAFFICKINGVICTIMS PROTECTION REAUTHORIZATION ACTOF2003\nViolation of theTraffickingVictims Protection Reauthorization Act (“TVPRA”),\n18U.S.C.§§1584,1589,1590,1592,1594,1595\nAll Defendants\n213.

' \n  ' \nv.  '    1:13-CV-497 \n  ' \nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL L.L.C. et al  ' \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE \n \n     This case is assigned to the Honorable Marcia A. Crone, United States District Judge, and is \nreferred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge for all pretrial matters pursuant to a \nReferral Order.  (Doc. No. 2.)  Pending before the undersigned is the “Motion to Dismiss \nPursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2)” filed by Malvern C. Burnett, the Law Offices of Malvern C. \nBurnett,  A.P.C.,  and  Gulf  Coast  Immigration  Law  Center,  L.L.C  (hereinafter  referred  to \ninterchangeably as “Burnett” and “the Burnett Defendants”).  (Doc. No. 10.)  The undersigned \nhas considered the pending motion and the corresponding response (Doc. No. 20).  The Burnett \nDefendants’ motion should be denied because: 1) the court has personal jurisdiction over the \nBurnett Defendants because the RICO statute provides for nationwide service of process; and 2) \nthe court has specific personal jurisdiction over the Burnett Defendants given the number of \nalleged tortious acts committed by the Defendants that injured the Plaintiffs within Texas.   \nI.  Background \nA.  Procedural Background \n  On March 7, 2008, twelve individuals who were allegedly trafficked into the United States \nfiled a putative class action against the Defendants in the Eastern District of Louisiana asserting \ntrafficking, RICO, civil rights, and state law contract and fraud claims.1  See David v. Signal Int’l, \n                                                 \n  1.  The Plaintiffs presumably still have FLSA claims pending in the Eastern District of Louisiana.  (Doc. \nNo. 24, p. 6.) \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 38   Filed 07/03/14   Page 2 of 14 PageID #:  685\nLLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220 (E.D. La.).  That Court denied class certification;2 and, as a result of \nthis ruling, the Plaintiffs in the instant action filed suit in this District, where they were allegedly \nsubjected to deplorable working conditions at a Signal facility in Orange, Texas.3  (Doc. No. 1.)  \nOn August 7, 2013, the Plaintiffs filed their complaint in this court against the Burnett Defendants, \nSignal International, L.L.C., Signal International, Inc., Signal International Texas, G.P., Signal \nInternational Texas, L.P. (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Signal”), Michael Pol, Global \nResources,  Inc., Sachin Dewan and Dewan Consultants Pvt.  Ltd.  (Id.)  Subsequently, the \nBurnett Defendants filed the instant motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(2).  (Doc. No. 10.)   \nB.  Factual Background    \n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, approximately 590 men, including the Plaintiffs, \nwere allegedly trafficked into the United States through the federal government’s H-2B guest \nworker program to provide labor and services to the Signal Defendants.  (Doc. No. 1, p. 1.)  The \nPlaintiffs claim they were lured to work for Signal through the fraudulent promise of legal and \npermanent work-based immigration to the United States for themselves and their families.  (Id., p. \n2.)  Subsequently, after coming to the United States, the Plaintiffs were allegedly subjected to \nforced labor and other serious abuses at Signal operations in Orange, Texas and Pascagoula, \nMississippi.  (Id., p. 3.)   The Burnett Defendants consist of Malvern C. Burnett and his two \ncorporations: Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, L.L.C. and the Law Offices of Malvern C. \nBurnett, A.P.C.  The Plaintiffs accuse Burnett of conspiring with Signal and other Defendants to \n                                                                                                                                                             \n \n  2.  David v. Signal Int’l, LLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. Jan. \n3, 2012). \n \n  3.  Maruthamuthu Mayavu is the only Plaintiff in this lawsuit who worked in Signal’s Pascagoula, \nMississippi facility as opposed to their Orange, Texas facility.  Curiously, the Defendants did not move to dismiss on \nthat basis.    \n2 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 38   Filed 07/03/14   Page 3 of 14 PageID #:  686\nrecruit Indian welders and pipefitters to fill anticipated H-2B guest worker jobs at Signal’s \noperations with false promises of permanent residency in the United States for the workers and \ntheir families.  (Id.)    \nII.  Jurisdiction \n  The Burnett Defendants move to dismiss the instant case under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(2), alleging that this court lacks personal jurisdiction over them.  (Doc. No. 10.)  \nRule 12(b)(2) requires a court to dismiss a claim if it does not have personal jurisdiction over the \ndefendant.  Grynberg v. BP P.L.C., 855 F. Supp. 2d 625, 638 (S.D. Tex. 2012); see FED. R. CIV. P. \n12(b)(2).  “When a court rules on a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction without \nholding  an  evidentiary  hearing,  the  party  asserting  jurisdiction  is  required  to  present  facts \nsufficient to constitute a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction to satisfy its burden.”  Duke \nEnergy Int’l, L.L.C. v. Napoli, 748 F. Supp. 2d 656, 678 (S.D. Tex. 2010) (citing Central Freight \nLines Inc. v. APA Transport Corp., 322 F.3d 376, 380 (5th Cir. 2003); Alpine View Co. v. Atlas \nCopco  A.B.,  205  F.3d  208,  214  (5th Cir.  2000)).    “[O]n  a  motion  to  dismiss  for  lack  of \njurisdiction, uncontroverted allegations in the plaintiff’s complaint must be taken as true, and \nconflicts between the facts contained in the parties’ affidavits must be resolved in the plaintiff’s \nfavor for purposes of determining whether a prima facie case for personal jurisdiction exists.”  \nBullion v. Gillespie, 895 F.2d 213, 217 (5th Cir. 1990). \nA.  Nationwide Service of Process under the RICO Statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1965(b) \n  In  their  complaint,  the  Plaintiffs  allege  RICO  claims  against  all  of  the  Defendants, \nincluding the Burnett Defendants.  (Doc. No. 1.)  A federal court obtains personal jurisdiction \nover a defendant in a suit based upon a federal statute if that statute provides for nationwide service \nof process and the defendant has had minimum contacts with the United States.  Busch v. \n3 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 38   Filed 07/03/14   Page 4 of 14 PageID #:  687\nBuchman, Buchman & O’Brien, Law Firm, 11 F.3d 1255, 1258 (5th Cir. 1994).  The Burnett \nDefendants have minimum contacts with the United States.  (See Doc. No. 10, Exh. 1, Affidavit \nof Malvern Burnett.)  Thus, the next issue to be decided is whether the RICO statute provides \nnationwide service of process.   \n  Title 18 U.S.C. § 1965 provides, in pertinent part: \n(a) Any civil action or proceeding under this chapter against any \nperson may be instituted in the district court of the United States for \nany district in which such person resides, is found, has an agent, or \ntransacts his affairs. \n(b) In any action under section 1964 [the civil RICO remedies] of \nthis chapter in any district court of the United States in which it is \nshown that the ends of justice require that other parties residing in \nany other district be brought before the court, the court may cause \nsuch parties to be summoned, and process for that purpose may be \nserved in any judicial district of the United States by the marshal \nthereof. \n \nWhile the Fifth Circuit has not yet ruled on this issue, it appears all of the district courts in \nthis Circuit have interpreted § 1965(b) to confer nationwide jurisdiction in a RICO action over \nnonresident  defendants  if  the  plaintiff  can  establish  personal  jurisdiction  over  at  least  one \ndefendant under § 1965(a).  Allstate Ins. Co. v. Plambeck, No. 3-08-cv-0388-M, 2009 WL \n347423, at *3 (N.D. Tex. Feb. 11, 2009) (citing Rolls–Royce Corp. v. Heros, Inc., 576 F. Supp. 2d \n765, 778-79 (N.D. Tex. 2008); Oblio Telecom, Inc. v. Patel, No. 3–08–cv–0279–L, 2008 WL \n4936488, at *4 (N.D. Tex. Nov. 18, 2008)); see also Hawkins v. Upjohn Co., 890 F. Supp. 601, \n606 (E.D. Tex. 1994); Paolino v. Argyll Equities, L.L.C., 401 F. Supp. 2d 712, 719 (W.D. Tex. \n2005); cf. Flores v. Koster, No. 3:11-cv-0726-M-BH, 2013 WL 4874117, at *4 (N.D. Tex. June \n28, 2013).  Furthermore, the majority of circuit courts have determined that § 1965(b) confers \nnationwide service of process in RICO cases.  See Allstate Ins. Co., 2009 WL 347423, at *3 n.2 \n(collecting cases).  Accordingly, the undersigned will follow the majority rule that § 1965(b) of \n4 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 38   Filed 07/03/14   Page 5 of 14 PageID #:  688\nthe RICO statute provides for nationwide service of process if the plaintiff can establish personal \njurisdiction over at least one defendant under § 1965(a).  That is easily met here.  In the instant \ncase, it is clear that Defendant Signal transacts its affairs in this forum as they have a facility in \nOrange, Texas.4   \nHaving decided § 1965(b) provides nationwide service of process, the last inquiry is \nwhether the “ends of justice require” the Burnett Defendants, who reside and conduct business in \nthe Eastern District of Louisiana and Southern District of Mississippi, be brought before the court \nin the Eastern District of Texas.  See 18 U.S.C. § 1965(b) (“In any action under section 1964 of \nthis chapter in any district court of the United States in which it is shown that the ends of justice \nrequire that other parties residing in any other district be brought before the court, the court may \ncause such parties to be summoned . . . .”).  “[T]he ‘ends of justice’ is a flexible concept uniquely \ntailored to the facts of each case.”  Cory v. Aztec Steel Building, Inc., 468 F.3d 1226, 1232 (10th \nCir. 2006).  The Fifth Circuit has not implemented any legal test as to what exact set of facts meet \n“the ends of justice” requirement.  See Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Byd:Sign, Inc., No. 6:05-cv-456, \n2006 WL 2822151, at *9 (E.D. Tex. Sept. 28, 2006).  While courts have used somewhat differing \ntests, the two considerations that are used most frequently are 1) whether no other district court \n                                                 \n  4.  In the conclusion of Burnett’s motion to dismiss, for the first time, Burnett states “he was not served \npursuant to the nationwide service of process provisions of RICO.”  (Doc. No. 10, p. 7.)  However, Burnett does not \nfurther explain this assertion nor provide any legal support for it.  While Burnett does not specifically state it in his \nmotion, presumably the Plaintiffs effected service on Burnett by utilizing the waiver provisions of Rule 4 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  See Joseph et al. v. Signal et al., 1:13-cv-324 (Doc. No. 50, p. 2).  While it is true \nthat a waiver of service does not waive an objection to personal jurisdiction, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(5), it certainly \ndoes not serve to eliminate a party’s ability to obtain personal jurisdiction over a defendant through a nationwide \nservice of process provision.    \n  Burnett also argues that even if § 1965(b) provides for nationwide service of process, “the requirements of the \nconstitution and due process must still be fulfilled.”  (Doc. No. 10, p. 2.)  This argument is somewhat irrelevant.  \nDue process concerns are subsumed when a federal court exercises personal jurisdiction over a defendant in a suit \nbased upon a federal statute providing for nationwide service of process and the defendant has minimum contacts with \nthe United States.  Busch, 11 F.3d at 1258.   \n \n5 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 38   Filed 07/03/14   Page 6 of 14 PageID #:  689\nwould have personal jurisdiction over all of the alleged RICO conspirators,5 and 2) judicial \neconomy.6   \nThe “ends of justice” require the Burnett Defendants to answer in this forum because \nnumerous defendants reside in different states, and there is likely no alternative forum in which \njurisdiction would be proper as to all defendants.7  Also, for reasons of judicial economy, the \n“ends of justice” should also require the Burnett Defendants to litigate this suit in Texas.  There \nare currently four plaintiffs in this case and over eighty in the four companion cases in which the \nBurnett Defendants are parties.8  Most of these same plaintiffs already have pending FLSA claims \nin the Eastern District of Louisiana stemming from the same allegations.  (Doc. No. 24, p. 6.)  \nApproximately ninety plaintiffs will be trying this case here in Texas against the defendants that \nhave not sought or may be denied their request to transfer venue.  Therefore, if the Burnett \nDefendants were dismissed from this case, most of the plaintiffs in this and the companion cases \nwould be litigating their FLSA claims against Signal in Louisiana; all of the plaintiffs would be \nlitigating their RICO, federal law and state law claims against the remaining defendants here; and \nthen potentially those same RICO, federal law and state law claims against only the Burnett \nDefendants  would be litigated in  an  entirely different  forum.9  That  would be  contrary to \n                                                 \n  5.  Butcher’s Union Local No. 498 v. SDC Investment, Inc., 788 F.2d 535, 539 (9th Cir. 1986). \n \n  6.  Farmers Bank of State of Del. v. Bell Mortg. Corp., 577 F. Supp. 34, 35 (D.C. Del. 1978). \n \n  7.  The various Signal Defendants have operations in Texas, Mississippi and Alabama and are organized \nunder the laws of Delaware; Defendant Michael Pol is a Mississippi resident; Defendant Global Resources, Inc. is \norganized under the laws of Mississippi; Defendant Sachin Dewan is a resident of India while Defendant Dewan \nConsultants is organized under the laws of India; Defendant Malvern Burnett is a Louisiana resident who practices law \nin Louisiana and Mississippi; and Defendants Law Office of Malvern Burnett, A.P.C. and Gulf Coast Immigration \nCenter are corporations organized under the laws of Louisiana.  The Plaintiffs generally aver that most, if not all, of \nthe Defendants have “substantial business contacts in Texas.”  (Doc. No. 1.)  \n \n  8.  See 1:13-cv-323; 1:13-cv-324; 1:13-cv-499; 1:13-cv-498. \n \n  9.  The Burnett Defendants do not say which forum they would be subject to personal jurisdiction. \n6 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 38   Filed 07/03/14   Page 7 of 14 PageID #:  690\nCongress’ intent for the “ends of justice” provision which enables plaintiffs to bring all members \nof a nationwide RICO conspiracy before a court in a single trial.  Butcher’s Union, 788 F.2d 535, \n539.  The undersigned also notes that it would be impractical to require the four Plaintiffs in this \ncase and roughly ninety plaintiffs in the companion cases to travel to a different forum all for the \nsake of the Burnett Defendants, who consist of a single attorney and two companies Burnett \ndescribes as “inactive” located in a contiguous state.  (Doc. No. 10, Exh. 1, p. 3.)    \n The Burnett Defendants argue that given the conclusory allegations against them in the \ncomplaint, the “ends of justice” do not require they be brought before this court.  (Doc. No. 10, p. \n5-6.)  They argue the Plaintiffs have failed to plead enough facts in their complaint to show the \nBurnett Defendants engaged in a conspiracy or a scheme to defraud or commit illegal acts \nsubjecting  them  to  the  personal  jurisdiction  of  this  court.   ( Id.)   These  are  not  relevant \nconsiderations when deciding whether “the ends of justice” require the Burnett Defendants to be \nbrought to Texas.  Questions of whether the complaint sufficiently pleads violations of the RICO \nstatute should not be raised in a motion under Rule 12(b)(2) challenging personal jurisdiction.  \nSee Allstate Ins. Co., 2009 WL 347423, at *4.  In fact, it is already the subject of another motion \nto dismiss filed by the Burnett Defendants.  (Doc. No. 11.)   \nB.  The Burnett Defendants are also subject to specific personal jurisdiction in this District \n  Although this court has personal jurisdiction over the Burnett Defendants due to the \nnationwide service provisions of the RICO statute, this court also has specific personal jurisdiction \nover the Burnett Defendants.  Absent a statute that permits nationwide service of process, when a \nsuit is based on a federal statute, the court looks to the long-arm statute of the state in which it sits \nto determine whether a defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction.  Omni Capital Intern., Ltd. \nRudolf Wolff & Co., Ltd., 484 U.S. 97, 105 (1987).  The Texas long-arm statute confers \n7 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 38   Filed 07/03/14   Page 8 of 14 PageID #:  691\njurisdiction to the limits of the federal constitution.  Companion Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co. v. Palermo, \n723 F.3d 557, 559 (5th Cir. 2013).  Therefore, the undersigned’s focus is whether the exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction offends or satisfies constitutional requirements of due process. \n  In order to satisfy due process, the Burnett Defendants must have “certain minimum \ncontacts with [Texas] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of \nfair play and substantial justice.”  Parker v. Pro W. Contractors, L.L.C., No. 13-30142, 2013 WL \n3534082, at *1 (5th Cir. July 15, 2013) (citing Int’l Shoe Co. v. State of Wash., 326 U.S. 310, 316 \n(1945)).  “The minimum contacts requirement is satisfied by either: (1) contacts that give rise to \ngeneral personal jurisdiction or (2) contacts that give rise to specific personal jurisdiction.”  Id. \n(citing Wilson v. Belin, 20 F.3d 644, 647 (5th Cir. 1994)).  Because the Plaintiffs do not argue \nminimum contacts are satisfied through general personal jurisdiction, the undersigned will focus \nonly on whether the Burnett Defendants have sufficient contacts that give rise to specific personal \njurisdiction. \n  “Specific  jurisdiction  is  proper  where  the  defendant  has  ‘purposefully  directed  his \nactivities at residents of the forum, and the litigation results from alleged injuries that arise out of \nor relate to those activities.’”  Parker, 2013 WL 3534082, at *1 (5th Cir. July 15, 2013) (citing \nBurger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 474 (1985)); see also Electrosource, Inc. v. \nHorizon Battery Techs. Ltd., 176 F.3d 867, 871 (5th Cir. 1999) (litigation must arise out of or \nrelate  to  activities  purposefully  directed  at  residents  of  the  forum).    “The  constitutional \nrequirement for specific jurisdiction is that the defendant has ‘minimum contacts’ with the forum \nstate such that imposing a judgment would not ‘offend traditional notions of fair play and \nsubstantial justice.”’  Stroman Realty, Inc. v. Wercinski, 513 F.3d 476, 484 (5th Cir. 2008) \n(quoting Int’l Shoe Co. v. State of Wash., Office of Unemployment Comp. & Placement, 326 U.S. \n8 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 38   Filed 07/03/14   Page 9 of 14 PageID #:  692\n310, 316 (1945)).   \n  The complaint (Doc. No. 1) raises these allegations against the Burnett Defendants:   \n  At all relevant times, the Burnett Defendants acted as agents \nof  Defendant  Signal  for  the  purpose  of  recruiting,  obtaining, \ncontracting with, transporting and/or providing Plaintiffs for labor \nor services in Signal’s Orange, Texas, and Pascagoula, Mississippi, \nfacilities.  During this process, Burnett represented to the Plaintiffs \nthat 1) Defendant Signal was a stable and reputable U.S. company \noffering lawful and ample employment opportunities; 2) working \nunder an H-2B visa for Signal was not inconsistent with applying \nfor  permanent  immigration  status  sponsored  by  Signal;  and  3) \nSignal would obtain work-authorized green cards for the Plaintiffs, \nenabling them to permanently and legally reside in the United States \nwith their families.  In actuality, the Defendants lacked the intent to \ndiligently pursue the Plaintiffs’ green card applications. They also \nlacked any basis whatsoever for representing, inter alia, that 1) the \ncompanies  and/or  entities  that  purportedly  were  sponsoring \nPlaintiffs’ applications were financially solvent and had reliable and \nstable employment opportunities to provide the Plaintiffs; 2) green \ncard applications sponsored by those companies would be valid and \nbona fide under U.S. immigration law; and 3) any applications were \nlikely  to  be  successfully  completed  and  approved  within  the \npromised timelines.   \n  All  of  the  Plaintiffs  undertook  considerable  economic, \nsocial, familial, and personal sacrifices to obtain the funds necessary \nto cover the fees paid to all of the Defendants involved in the \nrecruitment process, including Burnett.  Since first contracting with \nthe Defendants in India, the Plaintiffs have yet to receive the green \ncards that the Defendants promised them.  Despite clear contractual \nprovisions requiring them to do so, Burnett has refused to refund \nany of the Plaintiffs’ money, which was paid to them for the express \npurpose of processing and obtaining green cards and visas for the \nPlaintiffs. \n  In late May and early June of 2006, the Burnett Defendants \nfiled with the Texas Workforce Commission the completed forms \nETA 750 and attachments seeking permission to import and hire \n590  foreign  guest  workers  under  the  auspices  of  8  U.S.C.  § \n1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b), attendant regulations 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(6) \nand 20 C.F.R. § 655.3 and associated administrative letters and/or \nguidance (commonly known as “the H-2B guest worker program”) \non behalf of Signal.  Burnett knew Signal projected the labor need \nthat it sought to fill with foreign workers to be for at least two to \nthree years.  However, in these applications, they only stated that \nthey would employ the workers from October 1, 2006 to July 31, \n9 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 38   Filed 07/03/14   Page 10 of 14 PageID #:  693\n2007.  Furthermore, they stated that “the temporary workers will \nwork for the length of the prescribed dates of need, will be paid in \naccordance with the prevailing wage and will return to their home \ncountry at the end of employment.”  The Plaintiffs entered the \nUnited States on H-2B  guest worker visas, issued by the U.S. \nGovernment on the basis of false statements in late 2006 and early \n2007  for  the  purposes  of  working  for  Defendant  Signal  at  its \nPascagoula, Mississippi, and Orange, Texas, facilities. \n  In the isolated and guarded atmosphere of the labor camps, \ngrappling with the crushing debts they had incurred to come to the \nUnited States, and fearful of the perceived dangers that existed \noutside of their fenced-in housing site, the Plaintiffs reasonably felt \nforced to live in the bunkhouses and continue working for Signal, \ndespite  terrible  living  and  working  conditions.   Plaintiffs’ \ncontinuing dependence upon Signal for their present and future \nimmigration status and their continuing high levels of indebtedness, \nalong with the prison-like living conditions that they had been \nexposed to, reasonably caused the Plaintiffs to fear serious harm \nand/or abuse of the legal process if they were to leave Signal’s \nemploy.  Under these circumstances, Plaintiffs reasonably felt like \nthey had no choice but to continue working for Signal under these \nconditions. \n  In sum, Defendants, individually and jointly, conspired and \nschemed to target Plaintiffs as Indian laborers, knowing that they \nwould be enticed by good pay and false promises of permanent \nresidency, to lure them into the United States. Furthermore, each \nDefendant,  individually  and  through  a  collaborative  enterprise \npremised upon fraud, mistreated Plaintiffs and deprived them of any \nbenefit of a fair bargain. \n   \nFirst, the Plaintiffs have clearly satisfied the minimum contacts requirement by alleging the \nBurnett  Defendants  supplied  false  information  to  the  Texas  Workforce  Commission  in  the \ndocuments Burnett filed to gain permission for the Plaintiffs to travel to the United States and to \nwork for Signal.  Burnett also admits visiting Signal’s Texas facility once or possibly twice to \nconsult  with  Signal’s  plant  manager  about  the  overall  status  and  employment  of  “the \nnon-immigrant workers who had been initially deployed to Signal’s facility in Texas.”  (Doc. No. \n10, Exh. 1.)  Furthermore, the Plaintiffs have also satisfied the minimum contacts requirement by \nalleging the Burnett Defendants committed acts outside of Texas that caused tortious injuries \n10 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 38   Filed 07/03/14   Page 11 of 14 PageID #:  694\nwithin Texas.  The Fifth Circuit has held that sufficient minimum contacts are established \n“[w]hen a nonresident defendant commits a tort within the state, or an act outside the state that \ncauses tortious injury within the state.”  Guidry v. United States Tobacco Co., 188 F.3d 619, 628 \n(5th Cir. 1999) (collecting cases).  “Even an act done outside the state that has consequences or \neffects  within the state will suffice as  a basis for jurisdiction in  a suit arising from  those \nconsequences if the effects are seriously harmful and were intended or highly likely to follow from \nthe nonresident defendant’s conduct.”  Id. (collecting cases).  An individual injured in Texas \n“need not go to [another jurisdiction] to seek redress from persons who, though remaining in other \nstates, intentionally, knowingly and recklessly caused severe physical, emotional and economic \ninjuries to the plaintiffs and others” in Texas.  Id. at 630.  Taking the allegations in the Plaintiffs’ \ncomplaint as true, and resolving all factual conflicts in their favor, the court finds the Plaintiffs \nhave established the Burnett Defendants have sufficient minimum contacts with Texas because the \nalleged tortious acts committed by the Burnett Defendants, even if most were committed outside of \nTexas, caused tortious injuries within Texas.  The Burnett Defendants, who allegedly conspired \nwith Signal to lure the Plaintiffs to Orange, Texas with false promises, cannot credibly argue that \nthey could not reasonably have anticipated being sued in this District. \nFinally, it will not “offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice” for this \ncourt to exercise personal jurisdiction over the Burnett Defendants.  The Fifth Circuit has used the \nfollowing test to assess the reasonableness of a court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction: “(1) the \nburden upon the nonresident defendant to litigate in that forum; (2) the forum state’s interests in \nthe matter; (3) the plaintiff’s interest in securing relief; (4) the interstate judicial system’s interest \nin obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies; and (5) the several states’ shared \ninterest in furthering substantive social policies.”  Stroman Realty, Inc. v. Wercinski, 513 F.3d \n11 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 38   Filed 07/03/14   Page 12 of 14 PageID #:  695\n476, 487 (5th Cir. 2008) (citing Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court, 480 U.S. 102, 113 \n(1987)).  First, the Burnett Defendants will not face a large burden in litigating the instant case in \nthis District, because the Burnett Defendants, who consist of a single attorney and two “inactive” \ncompanies, are located in Louisiana, which is contiguous to Texas.  Second, the forum state, \nTexas, does have an interest in the matter because the Plaintiffs were allegedly injured while \nworking at Signal’s Orange, Texas facility.  Third, keeping the Burnett Defendants claims in this \nDistrict will provide the most efficient resolution of this case.  Notwithstanding their status as \nputative class members, the Plaintiffs have already moved their case once from a different federal \ndistrict court after their motion for class certification was denied.  David v. Signal Int’l, LLC, Civ. \nA. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. Jan. 3, 2012).  The most \nexpeditious option at this point would be to continue this case in this District.  Finally, the Burnett \nDefendants have not pointed out any clashes between the substantive social policies of Texas and \nany other potential forum state in regards to this case.  There is no reason to believe that the State \nof Texas and the other potential forum state have different levels of interest in or conflicting views \non the social issues pervading this case.  Taking these factors into consideration, the undersigned \nfinds that traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice will not be offended by exercising \npersonal jurisdiction over the Burnett Defendants.  \nIn summary, the undersigned finds the Plaintiffs have presented sufficient facts to establish \na prima facie case of personal jurisdiction over the Defendants because the RICO statute provides \nfor nationwide service of process.  In the alternative, the undersigned also finds the Plaintiffs have \nestablished a prima facie case that this court has personal jurisdiction over the Burnett Defendants \nby showing 1) the Burnett Defendants have sufficient minimum contacts with Texas; and 2) it will \nnot offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice for this court to exercise personal \n12 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 38   Filed 07/03/14   Page 13 of 14 PageID #:  696\njurisdiction over the Burnett Defendants. \nIV.

' \n  ' \nv.  '    1:13-CV-497 \n  ' \nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL L.L.C., et al.  ' \n \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER ON THE PARTIES’  \nMOTIONS TO EXCLUDE EXPERT TESTIMONY \n \nThis case is assigned to the Honorable Marcia Crone, United States District Judge, and is \nreferred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge for pretrial proceedings pursuant to a \nreferral order entered on August 8, 2013.  (Doc. No. 2.)  Pending before the undersigned are \neight motions to exclude and/or limit expert testimony.  The Plaintiffs moved to exclude the \nfollowing experts: Ron McAlear, Ronald L. Signorino, Enrique Gonzalez, Dr. Louise Shelley, \nand Dr. Kevin Fox Gotham.  (Doc. Nos. 70, 71, 72, 73, 77.)  Defendants Signal International, \nL.L.C., Signal International, Inc., Signal International Texas, G.P., Signal International Texas, \nL.P. (collectively, ―Signal‖) moved to exclude the Plaintiffs‘ experts Clyde Payne, Florence \nBurke, and Amy Mowl.  (Doc. Nos. 68, 69, 76.)  Because the motions all relate to the same \noperative facts, apply the same law, and at times relate to one another, the undersigned will \naddress all the pending motions in one order. \nI.  BACKGROUND \n \nIn  the  aftermath  of  Hurricane  Katrina,  approximately  590  men,  including  the  four \nPlaintiffs in this case, were allegedly trafficked into the United States to provide labor for \nSignal‘s operations.  (Doc. No. 1, pp. 1–4.)  The Plaintiffs claim that the Defendants ―conspired \nand schemed to target Plaintiffs as Indian laborers, knowing that they would be enticed by good \npay and false promises of permanent residency, to lure them in to the United States.‖  (Id. at p. \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 2 of 35 PageID #:  3215\n4.)  They also claim that they were forced to live in ―overcrowded, unhygienic, and disease-\nridden work camps resembling prisons‖ and felt compelled to continue working for Signal due to \nfears of ―deportation after learning that their temporary visas had expired‖ and the significant \ndebts they incurred in their homeland.  (Id. at pp. 3–4.)  \nA putative class action was filed in the Eastern District of Louisiana on behalf of all the \nworkers who had allegedly been trafficked to the United States to work at Signal‘s facilities in \nTexas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.  (See Doc. 1, David v. Signal Int‘l, L.L.C., 2:08-cv-1220 \n(March 7, 2008)).  The court in David denied class certification, which caused the individual \nclass members to file suit where their alleged injuries occurred.  See David v. Signal Int‘l, \nL.L.C., No 08-1220, 2012 WL 10759668, at *37 (E.D. La. Jan. 4, 2012).  The Plaintiffs in this \ncase worked at Signal‘s facility in Orange, Texas, which is within this judicial district.  \nThe Plaintiffs allege that some or all of the Defendants violated the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Reauthorization Act of 2003 and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations. \n(Doc. No. 1, pp. 39–54.)  In addition, the Plaintiffs assert causes of action for state law fraud, \nnegligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract against all of the Defendants.  (Id. at pp. 49–\n52.)  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \n \nThe admission or exclusion of expert testimony is a matter within the discretion of the \ndistrict court.  Kuhmo Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 152 (1999); Huss v. Gayden, 571 \nF.3d 442, 452 (5th Cir. 2009).  Federal Rule of Evidence 702 provides: \nIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact \nto understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as \nan expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify \nthereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon \nsufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 3 of 35 PageID #:  3216\nmethods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to \nthe facts of the case. \n \nFED. R. EVID. 702; accord Kuhmo Tire Co., 526 U.S. at 152; Daubert v. Merrel Dow Pharms., \nInc., 509 U.S. 579, 588 (1993).  The proponent of the proffered expert testimony ―has the burden \nof establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the pertinent admissibility requirements \nare met.‖  United States v. Fullwood, 342 F.3d 409, 412 (5th Cir. 2003) (citing FED. R. EVID. \n104(a)).      \nThe  district  court  is  to  consider  several  criteria  in  determining  whether  an  expert‘s \nopinion is admissible.  First, whether the proffered expert is qualified to testify because of his \nknowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.  United States v. Cooks, 589 F.3d 173, 179 \n(5th Cir. 2009) (citing FED. R. EVID. 702); Wilson v. Woods, 163 F.3d 935, 937 (5th Cir. 1999).  \n―[T]o qualify as an expert, ‗the witness must have such knowledge or experience in [his] field or \ncalling as to make it appear that his opinion or inference will probably aid the trier in his search \nfor truth.‘‖  United States v. Hicks, 389 F.3d 514, 524 (5th Cir. 2004) (quoting United States v. \nBourgeois, 950 F.2d 980, 987 (5th Cir. 1992)) (internal quotations omitted).   \n  Second, whether the proffered expert‘s testimony is reliable.  See Kuhmo Tire Co., 526 \nU.S. at 152.  The court possesses considerable flexibility in assessing the reliability of expert \ntestimony.  Id. at 141; Stolt Achievement, Ltd. v. Dredge B. E. Lindholm, 447 F.3d 360, 366 (5th \nCir. 2006).  While the Daubert factors are the most common benchmark, the court should \nconsider all relevant factors, and is not required to analyze the Daubert factors in every case.  \nStolt Achievement, Ltd, 447 F.3d at 366 (citing Kuhmo Tire Co., 526 U.S. at 149).

This role requires a court to make ―a preliminary assessment of whether the \nreasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that \nreasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.‖  Daubert, 509 U.S. at \n592–93.  The court should approach this task ―with proper deference to the jury‘s role as the \narbiter of disputes between conflicting opinions.‖ United States v. 14.38 Acres of Land, 80 F.3d \n1074, 1077 (5th Cir. 1996) (quoting Viterbo v.

Plaintiffs‘ ―Motion to Exclude the Testimony and Strike the Expert Report of Ron  \nMcAlear‖ (Doc. No. 70) \n \nSignal  retained  Ronald  J.  McAlear  (―McAlear‖)  ―for  the  purpose  of  providing \ninformation and guidance on Shipyard normal and customary practices . . . .‖  (Doc. No. 70, Ex. \n4, p. 1.)1  McAlear is an engineer, holds a master‘s degree from the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology, and has spent his career working in all facets of the shipbuilding industry, including \nat  the  management  level.    (Id.  at  pp.  9–11.)    Though  difficult  to  discern  precisely  what \nMcAlear‘s  opinions  are,  it  appears  that  he  concludes  that  Signal  ―applies  the  normal  and \ncustomary industry practices‖ in several areas, including: safety, quality, the environment, the \nuse of I.D. badges, and the issuance of personal protective equipment.  (Id. at p. 7.)   \nThe Plaintiffs seek to exclude McAlear as an expert on the grounds that: (1) he is not \nqualified to testify as an expert on safety; (2) his opinions are irrelevant; (3) his opinions are not \nbased on sufficient or reliable facts or data; and (4) his methodology is flawed.  (Doc. No. 70-1, \npp. 11–14.) \na.  Scope of McAlear’s opinions \nBefore discussing the Plaintiffs‘ specific arguments, it necessary to clarify the scope \nMcAlear‘s opinions.  The Plaintiffs argue that McAlear is not qualified to offer any opinions ―on \nany subject that might be relevant,‖ and specifically point to the fact that McAlear admitted he \nwas not an expert on safety.  (Doc. No. 70-1, p. 16.)  Signal counters that McAlear will opine \n―that Signal‘s conduct as a marine fabricator and employer was customary, ordinary and within \nindustry standards in its day to day employment of the Plaintiffs in this case.‖  (Doc. No. 79, p. \n                                                           \n1. The Plaintiffs attach two versions of McAlear‘s report.  One dated July 29, 2014 (Exhibit 4) and one \ndated August 27, 2014 (Exhibit 1).  While both reports appear to be similar, the August Report is longer and more \nrobust.  The Plaintiffs acknowledge that this report was timely served in this case.  (Doc. No. 70-1, p. 2, n. 2.)  \nAccordingly, this will be considered the operative report for this case. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 6 of 35 PageID #:  3219\n1.)  Signal, however, clarifies that McAlear is not being offered ―as a safety expert.‖  (Id.)  In \nfact, Signal concedes that he is not an expert on safety.  However, at times, McAlear opines that \nSignal‘s facilities were in fact safe.  For example, he states, ―Signal has operated one of the \nsafest shipyards in the Industry‖ and that Signal‘s ―safety record is evident when you compare \nthe historical safety performance ratings from 2003 to 2013.‖  (Doc. No. 70, Ex. 1, p. 25.)  \nMcAlear goes so far as to call Signal‘s safety record ―exemplary.‖  (Id.)  Such opinions go \nbeyond merely discussing what is customary in the industry.   \nAs a preliminary matter, the undersigned finds that McAlear‘s opinions on safety are \ninadmissible for two reasons.  First, McAlear admits that he is ―not an expert in safety.‖  (Doc. \nNo. 70, Ex. 3, 131:12.)  Therefore, he is not qualified to render such opinions.  Second, he has \nnot examined sufficient information nor applied a reliable or meaningful principle to reach these \nparticular conclusions.  Rendering an opinion that Signal‘s safety record is ―exemplary‖ would \nrequire considering and balancing Signal‘s safety record against that of other companies or \nagainst identifiable industry standards.  McAlear undertook no such analysis.  Conversely, to \nopine generally that Signal‘s practices are consistent with industry customs only requires being \nfamiliar with the industry and being familiar with Signal‘s practices.  \n  Accordingly, McAlear‘s opinions are limited to those relating to customary practices \nwithin the marine fabrication industry, and he may not opine as to whether Signal‘s facilities \nwere in fact safe. \nb.  McAlear is qualified to testify about industry customs \nThe Plaintiffs argue that McAlear‘s report should be excluded because he admitted that \nhe is not an expert on safety, and therefore, not qualified to testify as an expert.  (Doc. No. 70-1, \np. 12.)  However, as discussed above, the Plaintiffs‘ characterization of McAlear‘s opinions is \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 7 of 35 PageID #:  3220\ntoo narrow.  He is not just opining on whether Signal is a safe company or about its safety \nrecord.  Rather, he discusses general industry customs and Signal‘s practices measured against \nthose customs.  Given McAlear‘s ―[o]ver 40 years of experience in all aspects of the Marine \nIndustry,‖  including  experience  in  managing  and  running  shipyards,  his  practical  work \nexperience qualifies him as an expert about general practices in the industry.  (Doc. No. 70, Ex. \n1, App. A); see also Martin v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., No. 2:10-cv-268, 201l WL 6399690, at  *1 \n(S.D. Miss. Dec. 20, 2011) (finding that an expert‘s twenty-four  years of work experience \nqualified him to testify as an expert); Satcher v. Honda Motor Co., 52 F.3d 1311, 1317–18 (5th \nCir. 1995) (holding that the district court did not err in finding an expert qualified to testify based \non his experience). \nc.  McAlear’s opinions are relevant \nThe Plaintiffs claim that McAlear‘s report should be struck because ―[g]eneral standards \nand practices in the industry and Signal‘s shipyard safety practices are not relevant to‖ any of \ntheir claims.  (Doc. No. 70-1, p. 12.)  In response, Signal asserts that due to the Plaintiffs‘ factual \nallegations about the use of I.D. badges and unsafe working conditions, McAlear‘s opinions \nabout general industry practices are relevant.  (Doc. No. 79, pp. 2–4.)  Signal is correct—the \nPlaintiffs‘ complaint makes numerous references to the conditions of employment imposed by \nSignal.  For example, the Plaintiffs‘ complaint discusses the testing and re-testing by Signal, the \nfact that Signal charged the Plaintiffs for job-related tool kits, the use of I.D. badges, and general \nworking conditions.  (See Doc. No. 1, pp. 25–30.)  \nExpert  testimony  is  admissible  if  it  will  ―help  the  trier  of  fact  to  understand  the \nevidence . . . .‖    See    FED.  R.  CIV.  702.    To  the  extent  that  the  Plaintiffs  criticize  certain \nconditions of their employment and complain that they were working in substandard conditions, \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 8 of 35 PageID #:  3221\nexpert testimony claiming that these are customary practices is relevant.  Moreover, a potential \njuror is unlikely to be familiar with customary shipyard practices, and as such, expert testimony \nwill assist the jury on this topic.  In other words, it would be unfairly prejudicial to Signal to \nallow the Plaintiffs to discuss the working conditions they faced at Signal and attempt to cast \nthese conditions in a negative light, without allowing Signal the ability to at least offer testimony \nthat shows some of these conditions are standard within in the industry.  Accordingly, McAlear‘s \ntestimony meets the helpfulness requirement of Rule 702.   See U.S. v. Tucker, 345 F.3d 320, \n327 (5th Cir. 2003) (noting that the relevance inquiry centers on ―whether expert testimony \nproffered in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it will aid the jury in resolving \na factual dispute‖) (quoting Daubert, 509 U.S. at 591).2  \nd.  McAlear’s opinions are based on sufficient facts and data \nNext, the Plaintiffs contend that McAlear‘s report should be struck because he based his \nopinions on documents found on Signal‘s website.  (Doc. No. 70-1, p. 13); (Doc. No. 91, p. 3) \n(―McAlear‘s blind reliance on internet sources is alarming and discredits Signal‘s opposition that \nMr. McAlear‘s sources were sufficient.‖).  Stated another way, McAlear did not consider a \nsufficient amount of information from a reliable source.  This type of challenge goes to the \nweight of his testimony, not its admissibility.  See 14.38 Acres of Land, 80 F.3d at 1077 (―As a \ngeneral rule, questions relating to the bases and sources of an expert‘s opinion affect the weight \nto  be  assigned  that  opinion  rather  than  its  admissibility  and  should  be  left  for  the  jury‘s \nconsideration.‖).    Moreover,  a  review  of  Appendix  B  to  McAlear‘s  report  illustrates  that \nMcAlear reviewed materials beyond just those available on Signal‘s website.  (Doc. No. 70, Ex. \n1,  App.  B.)    He  reviewed  ISO  certifications,  deposition  excerpts,  and  even  conducted  an \n                                                           \n2. The Plaintiffs also argue that McAlear‘s opinions about industry customs are not relevant to their § 1981 \nclaim.  (Doc. No. 91, pp. 2–3.)  The Plaintiffs, however, have not asserted such a claim in this case.  (Doc. No. 1.)  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 9 of 35 PageID #:  3222\n―informal survey‖ on tools and protective gear.  (Doc. No. 70, Ex. 1, pp. 12–13.)  Accordingly, \nthe undersigned finds that McAlear has reviewed enough information  to  opine on whether \nSignal‘s practices meet industry norms.  To the extent that the Plaintiffs wish to challenge the \nbases for McAlear‘s opinions, they can do so on cross-examination. \ne.  McAlear’s opinions are the product of reliable principles and/or methods \nThe Plaintiffs state that McAlear has met none of the Daubert factors.  (Doc. No. 70, pp. \n14–15.)  The relevant inquiry, however, is not whether any or all of the Daubert factors are met, \nbut rather, whether there is any reasonable criteria on which the expert based his opinion.  See \nStolt Achievement, Ltd., 447 F.3d at 366; see also Huck v. City of Beaumont, 147 F. Supp. 2d \n565, 568 (E.D. Tex. 2001) (Cobb, J.) (―[T]he Daubert inquiry is always fact-specific, and . . . the \nDaubert factors may not all apply.‖).  Here, McAlear balanced his expertise about industry \ncustoms against sufficient information about Signal‘s practices to reach the conclusion that \nSignal‘s practices as to quality, the environment, the use of I.D. badges, and the issuance of \npersonal protective equipment are ―normal and customary‖ within the industry.  (Doc. No. 70, \nEx. 1, p. 28.)  This type of analysis is sufficient to support McAlear‘s opinions.   \nf.  Conclusion \n  For  the  reasons  stated  above,  the  undersigned  GRANTS  IN  PART  the  Plaintiffs‘ \n―Motion to Exclude the Testimony and Strike the Expert Report of Ron McAlear‖ (Doc. No. 70).  \nMcAlear may testify about general industry practices and opine on whether Signal‘s practices are \nconsistent with these customs.  McAlear, however, may not opine that Signal is a safe company \nor has an ―exemplary safety record.‖ \n \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 10 of 35 PageID #:  3223\nB.  The Plaintiffs‘ ―Motion to Exclude the Testimony and Strike the Expert Report of Kevin \nFox Gotham‖ (Doc. 77) \nSignal designated Kevin Fox Gotham, Ph.D. (―Dr. Gotham‖), a professor of sociology at \nTulane University, to ―evaluate the availability of housing in the Gulf Coast region in . . . Orange \nCounty[,] Texas in the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita.‖  (Doc. 84, p. 2.)  He offers six \nopinions that touch on the lack of available housing in the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and \nRita, the impacts that this had on businesses to recruit workers, and why Signal built the ―man \ncamps.‖  (Doc. 77, Ex. A.) \n  The Plaintiffs claim that Dr. Gotham‘s report should be struck because it is (1) irrelevant \nand (2) based on insufficient facts and data.  The Plaintiffs also argue that Dr. Gotham‘s report \nshould be limited to the four opinions that were contained in the report that was served in this \ncase, as opposed to the six opinions served in David (a parallel case decided in the Eastern \nDistrict of Louisiana).  \na.  Dr. Gotham’s last two opinions should not be struck for failing to serve them3 \nExhibit A to the Plaintiffs‘ motion contains three reports by Dr. Gotham.  The first report \nwas signed (and presumably served) on July 29, 2014 and contains four opinions.  The second \nreport, which contains the case style for David v. Signal Int’l, is dated August 28, 2014 and \ncontains six opinions.  The third report is dated December 5, 2014 and contains the case style \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission et al. v. Signal Int’l.  This report also contains six \nopinions.  The Plaintiffs seek to limit any opinions given by Dr. Gotham to those contained in \n                                                           \n3.  The decision whether to allow a late filed expert report—which is essentially why the Plaintiffs seek to \nlimit Dr. Gotham‘s opinions—involves determining whether to amend the scheduling order.  This inquiry involves a \nfour-factor test.  See Geiserman, 893 F.2d at 790–91.  In contrast, determining whether Dr. Gotham‘s opinions are \nadmissible, is a different inquiry.  Therefore, the undersigned finds it necessary to first consider whether these \nopinions are properly part of this case, before determining whether they are admissible.  As will be discussed below, \nopinions E and F are struck from this case.  \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 11 of 35 PageID #:  3224\nthe July 29 report.4  Signal does not address which report it contends is the operative report for \nthis case. \nStarting with the latest drafted report—the EEOC Report—it is dated after the deadline \nfor designating experts.  (See Doc. No. 30) (requiring Defendants to designate experts witnesses \nby November 28, 2014).  Signal has not moved to extend the deadline or untimely serve this \nreport.  Moreover, Dr. Gotham was deposed on October 6, 2014.  Therefore, the Plaintiffs would \nnot have had the ability to question Dr. Gotham about the particulars of the EEOC Report.  \nTherefore, if Signal intends on claiming that this is the operative report, it must seek leave to file \nan untimely expert report. \nAs to the David Report, even if not formally served, it is evident that the Plaintiffs had \nthe opportunity to depose Dr. Gotham regarding all six opinions contained in the David Report.  \nIt also appears that the Plaintiffs had this report in advance of his deposition, and there is nothing \nin the record demonstrating that the Plaintiffs‘ deposition preparation as to all six opinions was \nhindered.  Moreover, while Dr. Gotham testified that he does not plan to amend his report, his \ndeposition testimony is clear that he plans to offer six opinions in this case.  (Doc. No. 77, Ex. B, \n156:6–159:4.)  Therefore, there is no unfair surprise.  Lastly, the deadline for serving expert \nreports was November 28, 2014.  (Doc. No. 30.)  Assuming that the David Report was served in \nthis case on August 28, 2014—the date it was signed—it would be timely.  \nAccordingly, because the Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate how they were prejudiced \nby this report, the undersigned will consider the David Report as the operative report in this case.  \nReliance Ins. Co., 110 F.3d at 257–58 (applying the four factor test articulated in Geiserman).    \n   \n                                                           \n4.  Specifically, the Plaintiffs seek to exclude two opinions that were added to the David Report, but the \nPlaintiffs make no mention of the EEOC Report, which appears to be somewhat different. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 12 of 35 PageID #:  3225\nb.  Dr. Gotham’s opinions are relevant5 \nThe Plaintiffs argue that Dr. Gotham‘s first three opinions regarding the impacts of \nHurricanes Rita and Katrina on the Gulf South are ―so pedestrian that courts have taken judicial \nnotice of it.‖  (Doc. No. 77-1, p. 8) (citing two cases taking judicial notice of the damage caused \nby Hurricane Katrina).  Therefore, according the Plaintiffs, Gotham‘s opinions fail to meet the \nhelpfulness standard of Federal Rule of Evidence 702(a).  (Id. at pp. 8–9.)  Signal responds by \narguing that Dr. Gotham‘s report is helpful because it provides context that ―will assist the Court \nand the jury in determining the nexus between Signal‘s logic, intentions, and actions.‖  (Doc. No \n84, p. 6.) \nTo  meet  the  first  prong  of  Rule  702,  ―the  expert‘s  scientific,  technical,  or  other \nspecialized knowledge [must] help the trier of fact understand the evidence or to determine a fact \nin issue.‖  FED. R. CIV. P. 702(a).  The Plaintiffs claim that there is no need for expert testimony \non the fact that hurricanes Rita and Katrina destroyed housing on the Gulf Coast.  Dr. Gotham‘s \nopinions, however, go beyond this one basic idea.  For example, he also opines on the ―problems \nthat . . . businesses faced in attracting skilled labor in the context of widespread housing damage \nin the months and years after Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita.‖  (Doc. 84, p. 5); (see also \nDoc. 77, Ex. A, pp. 23–27) (discussing the correlation between the lack of available housing and \nthe difficulty in attracting workers).  Moreover, the extent of the housing shortage may be \nbeyond the knowledge of a layperson.  While some jurors may still remember what life was like \nafter the hurricanes, it is plausible that a juror may have only recently moved to the area and \nlacks such familiarity.  In addition, these hurricanes occurred nearly ten years ago—it is possible \n                                                           \n5.  The Plaintiffs moved to exclude Dr. Gotham‘s report in its entirety, but did not move in the alternative \nto strike opinion B, which addresses the impacts that Hurricane Katrina had on Mississippi.  Moreover, interspersed \nwith Dr. Gotham‘s other opinions is a discussion of the Mississippi area, which was the location of another Signal \nfacility.  The undersigned questions whether a discussion of the Mississippi region is relevant to this case.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 13 of 35 PageID #:  3226\nthat memories have faded.  Accordingly, information regarding the housing market and the \nimpact that it had on attracting workers to the area is helpful, and as such, meets Rule 702(a). \nFurthermore, contested factual issues include why Signal allegedly forced the Plaintiffs to \nlive in the ―man camps‖ and why Signal needed to use an immigrant labor force.  The state of the \nhousing  market  is  arguably  relevant  to  these  issues.    Therefore,  by  offering  a  big  picture \nperspective on what the housing market was like during the relevant period, Dr. Gotham‘s \ntestimony is helpful.  In short, if the Plaintiffs are going to claim that there was no need for \nSignal to build the ―man camps,‖ then testimony on the state of the housing market is relevant.   \nc.  Sufficient facts and data  \n  Dr. Gotham‘s opinions can be broken into two general categories: (1) general opinions \nabout the impacts of the hurricanes (opinions A through D) and (2) opinions about Signal‘s \nactions (opinions E and F).  The Plaintiffs seek to exclude Dr. Gotham‘s opinion ―related to the \navailability of adequate housing for Signal workers, apparently in the Orange, Texas, area.‖  \n(Doc. No. 77-1, p. 9.)  \nAs to Dr. Gotham‘s general testimony, he relies on sufficient facts and data to reach \ngeneral conclusions about the state of the housing market and the difficulty in attracting workers \nto disaster areas.  While the utility of such testimony is questionable, as discussed above, it meets \nthe admissibility requirements of the Federal Rules of Evidence.  In addition, while the Plaintiffs \nfault him for not considering the data on a granular enough level (i.e. examining specific vacancy \nrates),  he  considered  sufficient  data  to  conclude  that  the  housing  markets  were  negatively \nimpacted by the hurricanes.    \n  Dr. Gotham‘s more specific opinions, however, should be excluded.  As for opinion E, \nDr. Gotham has not reviewed enough specific information about housing availability in close \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 14 of 35 PageID #:  3227\nproximity to Signal‘s facility in Orange, Texas to reach the conclusion that ―Signal built on-site \nfacilities to address an acute housing shortage for workers.‖  (Doc. 77, Ex. A, p. 34); (see also id. \nat p. 37) (―[I]t is my opinion that the dearth of housing availability in Orange County, Texas . . . \ncreated major obstacles for businesses in these areas to attract and keep the labor necessary for \nbusiness and community recovery efforts.‖).  To reach such a specific opinion he would need to \nlook at the housing market in an area in close proximity to Signal‘s facility in Orange, Texas.  \nDr. Gotham has undertaken no such analysis.  He did not consider specific data in a narrowly \ndefined region, and even classifies his report as considering ―the state of the housing market in \ngeneral during the years after the disaster.‖  (Id., Ex. B, 68:12–14.)  Dr. Gotham‘s opinions that \nhousing was impacted by the hurricanes, without something specific to the area in question or \nwithout facts showing what housing was actually available near Signal‘s facility, will not support \nthis  opinion.    Moreover,  the  specific  data  upon  which  Dr.  Gotham  relies  focuses  on  the \nMississippi region, not on Texas.  (Id., Ex. A, pp. 37–38.)   \n  As for Opinion F, this opinion is improper because it is not helpful and usurps the role of \nthe jury.  Dr. Gotham is attempting to pass judgment on the propriety of Signal‘s actions as they \nrelate to the ―man camp.‖  For example, he states that ―Signal did not force or coerce the workers \nto stay in the on-site facility‖ (Id. at p. 42); that ―no plaintiff was ever required to live in the on-\nsite housing facilities . . . .‖ (Id. at p. 41); and that the housing facility benefited the Plaintiffs.  \n(Id. at p. 41–42.)  The jury, informed about the state of housing market generally and other \ntestimony, can determine whether Signal actually had no other choice but to build the ―man \ncamps‖ or that the Plaintiffs benefited from them. \n \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 15 of 35 PageID #:  3228\nd.  Conclusion \nFor the reasons stated above, the Plaintiffs‘ ―Motion to Exclude the Testimony and Strike \nthe Expert Report of Kevin Fox Gotham‖ (Doc. 77) is GRANTED IN PART.  Dr. Gotham may \nopine about the state of housing in the areas impacted by the hurricanes and the correlation \nbetween available housing and attracting skilled workers.  However, opinions E and F are struck, \nand he may not opine as to whether there was ―an acute‖ housing shortage in Orange, Texas, \nwhy Signal built the ―man camp,‖ whether the Plaintiffs were required or coerced into living at \nthe ―man camp,‖ or whether the ―man camp‖ actually benefited the Plaintiffs.   \nC.  Signal‘s ―Motion to Exclude the Opinion Testimony of Clyde Payne‖ (Doc. No. 68) \nThe Plaintiffs retained Clyde P. Payne (―Payne‖) to ―evaluate the applicability of, and \nSignal‘s  compliance  or  non-compliance  with,  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health \nAdministration‘s [―OSHA‖] standards and regulations for temporary labor camps.‖  (Doc. No. \n68, Ex. A, p. 1.)  Payne holds a master‘s degree in Environmental Science and has been a \nCertified Industrial Hygienist since 1983.  Id.  In addition, Payne was OSHA‘s Area Director of \nthe Jackson, Mississippi office for over twenty-two years.  Id. \nSignal  moves to  exclude Payne on two  grounds:  (1) his  opinions  about  OSHA are \nirrelevant and (2) they consist of impermissible legal conclusions.  \na.  Payne’s opinions are irrelevant \nSignal  argues that the ―Plaintiffs never alleged an OSHA violation in their original \ncomplaint against Defendants,‖ and, as such, Payne‘s opinions are ―irrelevant to the instant \nmatter.‖ (Doc. No. 98, p. 2); (see also Doc. No. 2132, David v. Signal In‘t, L.L.C., 2:08-cv-1220 \n(E.D. La. Jan. 11, 2015) (striking both parties‘ OSHA experts partly because whether OSHA was \nviolated had ―no bearing whatsoever on any of the remaining claims or defenses‖)).  Plaintiffs \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 16 of 35 PageID #:  3229\nrespond  and  argue  that  Payne‘s  testimony  is  relevant  because  it  supports  their  claims  of \ndiscrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and fraud.6  (Doc. No. 87, p. 4.)  They also argue that  \nPayne‘s opinions are relevant because they highlight the substandard conditions in the ―man \ncamps.‖  (Id. at 4–9.)  \nTo be admissible, an expert‘s opinions must ―help the trier of fact [] understand the \nevidence or [] determine a fact in issue.‖  FED. R. EVID. 702.  Payne‘s opinions, however, do \nneither.  No cause of action is dependent on Signal‘s non-compliance with OSHA, and the \nPlaintiffs fail to explain how alleged violations of OSHA support their fraud claim.  Ultimately, \nit is the Plaintiffs‘ burden to demonstrate why their expert‘s opinion is admissible. \nMoreover, whether certain OSHA regulations were violated will not assist the jury in \nunderstanding the evidence.  Here, the Plaintiffs‘ own testimony (if believed) regarding the \nconditions at the ―man camps‖ is more than sufficient for them to prove their trafficking, RICO, \nand other state-law claims.  For example, Payne opines that 29 C.F.R. § 1910.142(d)(9) was \nviolated because Signal failed to provide adequate toilet paper.  (Doc. No. 68, Ex. A, p. 20.)  A \nlay juror knows what constitutes adequate toilet facilities and, because no cause of action hinges \non a violation of this statute, jurors can easily ascertain from their own experiences whether the \nfacilities provided by Signal were adequate.  In short, expert testimony is not needed to assist the \njurors in evaluating the evidence regarding the living conditions at the ―man camps.‖    \nLastly, the undersigned recognizes that, at first blush, this ruling is in conflict with the \nundersigned‘s allowance of Payne‘s testimony in Joseph and Samuel.  In those cases, however, \nSignal did not move to strike Payne.  (See Doc. No. 222, pp. 12–14, Joseph v. Signal Int‘l, \nL.L.C., 1:13-cv-324 (E.D. Tex. Feb. 12, 2015)).  Accordingly, the undersigned found that the \nopinion of Virginia Miles, Signal‘s OSHA expert, as to whether certain OSHA regulations may \n                                                           \n6. The Plaintiffs have not asserted a § 1981 claim. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 17 of 35 PageID #:  3230\nor may not apply met the helpfulness prong of Rule 702.  In evaluating whether Miles‘s opinions \nwere helpful, it had to be assumed that Payne‘s opinions on the various ways in which Signal \nviolated OSHA would be offered.  As the undersigned noted: ―If the Plaintiffs are going to elicit \ntestimony from an expert that Signal failed to comply with certain OSHA regulations, then \nMiles‘s opinion, which merely offers a conflicting view on whether these regulations applied, is \nrelevant.‖  (Id.)  Here, the analysis and result is different because Signal moved to strike the \nPlaintiffs‘ OSHA expert. \nb.  Payne’s opinions consist of legal conclusions \nNot only are Payne‘s opinions unhelpful, they largely consist of impermissible legal \nconclusions.  In fact, Payne offers two layers of legal conclusions.  First, he finds that OSHA‘s \nregulations on Temporary Labor Camps apply to the ―man camps.‖  (Doc. No. 68, Ex. A, p. 7) \n(―My opinion is that OSHA‘s Temporary Labor Camp standards apply to Signal‘s housing camp \nat Orange, Texas.‖).  Second, he opines that certain regulations were violated.  For example, he \nopines: ―[T]he requirements of 29 C.F.R. 1910.142(a)(2) and 29 C.F.R. 1910.142(b)(2) for \nproviding adequate size of housing and sleeping areas for the H-2B Workers were not followed \nand a violation existed.‖  (Doc. No.  68, Ex. B, p. 19); (see also id. at p. 18) (―[I]t is my opinion \nthat Signal‘s Man Camp violated at least seven different Subsections of 29 C.F.R. § 1910 and the \ngeneral duty clause of the Act.‖).  The undersigned agrees with Signal and finds that whether \nOSHA applies and whether certain sections were violated are legal conclusions. \nThe Plaintiffs argue that these are not legal conclusions because ―Payne‘s use of OSHA \nstandards is not to convince the jury that Signal violated OSHA, rather it is to show the jury that \nSignal‘s housing was substandard.‖  (Doc. No. 87, pp. 4–5.)  Payne, however, is opining that \nSignal‘s conduct was a violation of the law—this is the very essence of a legal conclusion.  \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 18 of 35 PageID #:  3231\nWhile no cause of action hinges on whether Signal complied with OSHA (which is why Payne‘s \ntestimony is irrelevant) that does not mean his opinions that certain laws were violated are not  \nlegal conclusions.  In contrast, in Joseph and Samuel, Signal‘s OSHA expert merely opined that \nthere was nothing definitive that these regulations applied.  Thus, she stopped short of reaching \nan actual legal conclusion.  Payne, however, goes much further and instructs the jury on what \nlaw applied and whether it was violated.    \nc.  Conclusion \nFor the reasons stated above, Signal‘s ―Motion to Exclude the Opinion Testimony of \nClyde Payne‖ (Doc. No. 68) is GRANTED. \nD.  Plaintiffs‘  ―Motion  to  Exclude  the  Testimony  and  Strike  the  Report  of  Ronald  L. \nSignorino‖ (Doc. No. 71) \n \nThe Plaintiffs move to strike Signal‘s OSHA expert Ronald L. Signorino (―Signorino‖).  \n(Doc. No. 71.)  Having struck the Plaintiffs‘ OSHA expert Clyde Payne, Signorino‘s opinions, \nwhich were merely offered as a rebuttal, are now irrelevant.  In fact, Signal even concedes that it \nonly retained Signorino out of an abundance of caution to oppose any potential testimony by \nPayne.    (Doc.  No.  81,  p.  14)  (―Signorino  was  retained  needlessly,  as  was  Mr.  Payne.‖).  \nAccordingly, the Plaintiffs‘ motion is GRANTED.  \nE.  Signal‘s ―Motion in Limine to Exclude/Limit Testimony of Florence Burke‖ (Doc. No. \n69)7 \n \n  Florence Burke (―Burke‖) is the Plaintiffs‘ expert on human trafficking.  She offers \nopinions on the ―common features‖ of known human trafficking cases, and concludes that these \n                                                           \n7.  The Plaintiffs claim that Signal did not comply with the District‘s meet and confer requirement prior to \nfiling any of its motions.  (See Doc. No. 85, p. 5 n. 1.); see also Local Rule 7(h).  The Plaintiffs acknowledge that \nthe parties conferred regarding expert motions, but claim that all that was discussed were the Plaintiffs‘ motions, and \nSignal did not indicate that it was intending on filing any motions.  Signal‘s counsel responded with a sworn \naffidavit stating that parties conferred as to Signal‘s motions as well.  (Doc. No. 97, Ex. A.)  The undersigned takes \nmeet and confer requirement seriously.  In many instances, it can avoid disputes altogether or at least greatly narrow \nthe issues.  Here, because Signal‘s counsel has sworn under oath that Signal‘s motions to exclude expert testimony \nwere discussed, the undersigned will assume that to be true.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 19 of 35 PageID #:  3232\nPlaintiffs were in fact victims of human trafficking.  (See Doc. No. 69, Ex. B.)  Signal argues \nthat Burke‘s report should be struck for four reasons: (1) her report contains legal conclusions; \n(2) her opinions are unreliable; (3) she is not qualified to render an opinion regarding the \nPlaintiffs‘ mental state; and (4) she misrepresents her qualifications.  (Id.)  \na.  Permissible scope of expert testimony on human trafficking \nCourts  have  reached  varied  conclusions  on  whether  expert  testimony  on  human \ntrafficking is admissible.  Compare Elat v. Ngoubene, 993 F. Supp. 2d 497, 514 (D. Md. 2014) \n(allowing some testimony about human trafficking) with (Doc. No. 2038, David v. Signal Int‘l, \nL.L.C., No. 2:08-cv-1220 (E.D. La. Dec. 30, 2014) (striking all expert testimony on human \ntrafficking)).  The issue is that in this context, it is difficult to delineate between an opinion that \nis merely a legal conclusion (i.e., that 18 U.S.C. § 1590 was violated) and testimony that \neducates the jury and may be helpful.  While Federal Rule of Evidence 704 ―abolish[ed] the per \nse rule against testimony regarding ultimate issues of fact . . . [it] does not open the door to all \nopinions.‖  See Owen v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 698 F.2d 236, 241–42 (5th Cir. 1983).  ―The \nAdvisory Committee notes make it clear that questions which would merely allow the witness to \ntell the jury what result to reach are not permitted.  Nor is the rule intended to allow a witness to \ngive legal conclusions.‖  Id.  ―The line between a permissible opinion on an ultimate issue and \nan impermissible legal conclusion is not always easy to discern.‖  United States v. McIver, 470 \nF.3d 550, 562 (4th Cir. 2006).  \nIn  delineating  the  proper  of  scope  of  expert  testimony  on  human  trafficking,  the \nundersigned must guard against two things.  First, an expert must not be allowed to instruct the \njury on what the legal elements of human trafficking are (i.e., what is needed to prove a violation \nof 18 U.S.C. § 1590)—that is the court‘s job.  Second, an expert must be prevented from telling \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 20 of 35 PageID #:  3233\nthe  jury  what  conclusion  to  reach  as  to  whether  the  Plaintiffs  were  victims  of  human \ntrafficking—that is for the jury to decide.  Therefore, the issue is how to delineate between a \ngeneral  discussion  of  human  trafficking,  which  may  help  the  jury  better  understand  the \ncomplexities of human trafficking and is therefore admissible, and reaching a conclusion as to \nwhether these Plaintiffs were victims of human trafficking, which would usurp the role of the \njury.  This difficulty is further compounded by the fact that the term ―human trafficking‖ has \nboth  a  legal  and  a  colloquial  meaning,  further  blurring  the  line  between  permissible  and \nimpermissible testimony. \nThe undersigned finds the appropriate balance to be as follows: Burke may testify about \n―human  trafficking  in  general,‖  which  includes  discussing  the  general  features  of  human \ntrafficking schemes, but she may not offer an opinion on whether these Plaintiffs were victims of \nhuman trafficking.  This will allow Burke to educate and inform the jury on the subtleties of \nhuman  trafficking,  which  meets  the  helpfulness  requirement  of  Rule  702,  without  directly \noffering a legal conclusion.   FED. R. CIV. P. 702(a) (requiring that an expert‘s specialized \nknowledge ―help the trier of fact to understand the evidence‖).  Moreover, allowing Burke to \napply the facts of this case to her general standards would be tantamount to her telling the jury \nwhat conclusion to reach.  See also Elat, 993 F. Supp. 2d at 514 (striking portions of Burke‘s \ntestimony, but allowing her to testify generally about ―the patterns of coercion and threats that \nare  typically  present  in  situations  involving  the  exploitation  of  foreign  workers‖  and  other \ngeneral topics relating to human trafficking). \nTwo examples of the scope of permissible and impermissible testimony may be helpful.  \nFirst, the portion of Burke‘s report where she offers background on human trafficking and \ndiscusses  ―common  features  of  trafficking  situations‖  is  permissible  because  it  is  purely \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 21 of 35 PageID #:  3234\ninformative.  (Doc. No. 69, Ex. B, p. 11.)  However, Burke cannot take the next logical step and \nconclude that there was trafficking in this case or opine on how the Plaintiffs were affected.  For \nexample, she states:   \nHaving considered Plaintiffs‘ accounts of their trafficking experiences, it is my \nopinion that many of the trafficking factors identified above were present in \nDefendants‘  conduct  towards  them  and  operated  to  create  a  psychologically \ncoercive environment in which a reasonable worker in the Plaintiffs‘ situation \nwould have felt compelled to continue working for Signal.   \n \n(Id. at p. 13.)  This is nothing more than her evaluating the facts and reaching a conclusion that \nthere was trafficking—such an analysis is within the province of the jury.   \nSecond, Burke discusses in general terms how victims of human trafficking are often \nmade  a  set  promises  about  what  their  working  conditions  will  be  like,  but  in  reality,  the \nconditions tend to be significantly worse.  (Id. at p. 19.)  This is within the scope of permissible \ntestimony.  Burke, however, crosses the line by stating: ―the Plaintiffs in this case believe they \nwere deceived and betrayed in terms of their employment conditions, living conditions, net \nwages, opportunity to work, overtime hours, and immigration status.‖  (Id. at p. 20.)  The jury, \nafter hearing the facts, can evaluate whether the Plaintiffs were deceived. \nThe  above  examples  are  not  the  only  places  where  Burke‘s  opinions  go  too  far.  \nHowever, because her report is so intertwined with permissible and impermissible opinions, the \nundersigned will not attempt to state on a paragraph-by-paragraph (or sentence-by-sentence \nbasis) what is excluded from Burke‘s report.  The limitation that she may only opine about the \ncharacteristics of human trafficking in general, and not whether there was trafficking in this case, \nshould suffice.      \n \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 22 of 35 PageID #:  3235\nb.  Signal’s other arguments \n  Signal  also  raises  several  other  arguments  as  to  why  Burke‘s  testimony  should  be \nexcluded or limited.  First, Signal argues that Burke misrepresented two of her qualifications, \nand therefore should be struck.  (Doc. No. 69, pp. 2–3.)  The undersigned disagrees.  A review of \nher experience and training shows Burke has extensive experience working with victims of \nhuman trafficking and is qualified to testify as an expert on human trafficking.  (See id., Ex. B, \npp. 1–5.)  Whether the school where she obtained her Ph.D. in clinical psychology is accredited \nby the American Psychological Association, or whether her license to be a family counselor in \nCalifornia is still valid, does not impact whether she is qualified as an expert on trafficking.  To \nthe extent that Signal believes that these alleged misstatements affect the weight the jury should \nascribe to her testimony, it can raise such issues on cross-examination.   \nNext, Signal argues that Burke‘s report is unreliable because her interview process is \nflawed and that opinions based on Plaintiffs‘ statements are inadmissible.  (Doc. No. 69, pp. 6–\n9.)  Because Burke is precluded from reaching an opinion on the issue of whether the Plaintiffs \nwere victims of human trafficking, or evaluating the facts of this case as they relate to human \ntrafficking, Signal‘s argument is now moot.  (Id. at p. 9.)  Likewise, Signal‘s argument that \nBurke is not competent to ―reach a final diagnosis‖ is no longer at issue, since she will not be \ntestifying as to how these Plaintiffs were impacted.  Lastly, Signal argues that Burke ―lacks a \nfamiliarity with her materials cited.‖  (Id. at pp. 3–4.)  Signal claims that in previous versions of \nBurke‘s report, drafted for use in David, she cited a work that was subsequently removed.  \nBurke‘s deposition is clear, however, that she did not find it helpful.  This, however, is not a \nreason  to  strike  Burke‘s  report.    If  Signal  believes  that  this  change  casts  doubt  Burke‘s \ncredibility, Signal may raise this issue on cross-examination.   \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 23 of 35 PageID #:  3236\nc.  Conclusion \nSignal‘s ―Motion in Limine to Exclude/Limit Testimony of Florence Burke‖ (Doc. No. \n69) is GRANTED IN PART.  Burke‘s opinions shall be limited to those related to general \ncharacteristics of human trafficking schemes, and Burke is precluded from testifying whether \nthese Plaintiffs were victims of human trafficking or in what ways the facts of this case are \nsimilar to other known cases of human trafficking. \nF.  Plaintiffs‘ ―Motion to Exclude Testimony and Strike the Expert Report of Dr. Louise \nShelley‖ (Doc. No. 73) \n \nSignal designated Louise Shelley, Ph.D. (―Dr. Shelley‖) to testify as an expert on ―human \ntrafficking and related organized crime.‖  (Doc. No. 88, p. 1.)  Dr. Shelley received her Ph.D. in \nSociology from the University of Pennsylvania and is currently a professor at the School of \nPublic Policy at George Mason University.  Her forty-five page report leads to one ultimate \nconclusion: ―Signal was not engaged in human trafficking at any stage of the process with the \nH2B workers, either at recruitment, on their arrival in the United States or in their employ.‖ \n(Doc. No. 73, Ex. C, p. 44.)8  The Plaintiffs seek to exclude Dr. Shelley‘s report, arguing that: (1) \nher  report  contains  numerous  legal  conclusions;  (2)  her  methodology  is  not  valid;  (3)  her \ntestimony is not helpful; and (4) she impermissibly assesses the witnesses‘ credibility.  (Doc. No. \n73-1.) \na.  Dr. Shelley’s report contains impermissible legal conclusions \nThe Plaintiffs argue that Dr. Shelley‘s report should be struck because it is ―replete with \nlegal conclusions‖ and ―[t]hese conclusions fall far outside the scope of permissible expert \n                                                           \n8. The Plaintiffs note that two reports were served on them and attach both reports.  It is not clear from the \nface of either report which one was meant to be the operative report in this case.  Moreover, the Plaintiffs make no \nargument as to why one report is the operative report for this case over the other.  It appears that the more robust \nreport is the one attached at Exhibit C to the Plaintiffs‘ briefing.  Accordingly, for clarity, this will be considered the \noperative report. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 24 of 35 PageID #:  3237\ntestimony . . . .‖    (Doc.  No.  73-1,  p.  7.)    The  Plaintiffs  first  argue  that  Dr.  Shelley  offers \nnumerous legal conclusions about human trafficking.  For the same reasons that the Plaintiffs‘ \nhuman  trafficking  expert  report  was  limited,  Dr.  Shelley‘s  report  must  also  be  limited.  \nTherefore, Dr. Shelley‘s opinions are subject to the same limitation discussed above: Dr. Shelley \nmay only discuss the general characteristics of human trafficking, but may not opine as to \nwhether these Plaintiffs were in fact victims of human trafficking. \nIn addition, the Plaintiffs move to exclude five other alleged legal conclusions reached by \nDr. Shelley.  At the outset, because Dr. Shelley‘s testimony is limited to only a discussion about \nhuman trafficking generally, much of this part of the Plaintiffs‘ motion is now moot.  However, \nfor clarity, the undersigned will address the Plaintiffs‘ arguments.  First, the Plaintiffs‘ argue that \nDr. Shelley applies a more restrictive definition of human trafficking and forced labor, and \ntherefore, her conclusion that the ―Plaintiffs are not victims of human trafficking‖ is invalid and \nshould be struck.  Because Dr. Shelley cannot reach this opinion, the Plaintiffs‘ argument is \nmoot.9  Next, the Plaintiffs claim that Dr. Shelley offers an opinion on a ―non-existent‖ debt \nbondage claim.  A part of her report does address debt bondage.  (Doc. 73, Ex. C, pp. 11–12) \n(―[T]here was no debt bondage in this case under either the American or UN definition.‖).  Debt \nbondage has a specific legal definition, and differs from the Plaintiffs‘ claim that the financial \ndebts  they incurred forced them to  continue working for Signal.    See 22 U.S.C. §7102(5) \n(defining debt bondage as ―the status or condition of a debtor arising from a pledge by the debtor \nof his or her personal services or those of a person under his control as a security for debt‖).  The \n                                                           \n9.    The  undersigned,  however,  reserves  judgment  on  whether  Dr.  Shelley‘s  references  to  forms  of \ntrafficking that are not at issue would cause jury confusion.  The Plaintiffs‘ did not raise this argument.  They only \nargued that it would be improper for Dr. Shelley to reach a conclusion that these Plaintiffs were in fact victims of \nhuman trafficking.  On this point, the undersigned agrees.  However, to the extent that Dr. Shelley seeks to discuss \ntrafficking in general, and applies other standards, such as the United Nations definition, this may in fact be \nconfusing the jury, but the Plaintiffs did not raise this argument. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 25 of 35 PageID #:  3238\nPlaintiffs have not made a claim of debt bondage.  Accordingly, because Dr. Shelley‘s opinion \nregarding  debt  bondage  does  not  relate  to  any  cause  of  action  or  issue  in  this  case,  it  is \ninadmissible.  See Roman, 691 F.3d at 694. \nThird, Dr. Shelley claims that ―Signal was exempt from OSHA standards for the housing \nof its H2-B workers . . . .‖  (Doc. No. 73, Ex. C, p. 28.)  Dr. Shelley is not qualified to offer an \nopinion on the applicability of OSHA, therefore, this opinion is struck.  Fourth, the Plaintiffs \nseek to strike an opinion reached based on a letter issued by the United States Department of \nJustice  Special  Counsel  for  Immigration  Related  Unfair  Labor  Practices.    She  opines  that \nbecause the government found that Signal had not engaged in any unfair immigration related \nemployment practices, and this necessarily includes coercion, there could be no trafficking.  The \nPlaintiffs argue that this letter did not address Signal‘s actions and does not support a conclusion \nthat the Plaintiffs were not trafficked.  Because Dr. Shelley may only testify about human \ntrafficking generally, and may not opine as to whether there was trafficking in this case, there is \nno need for her to discuss this letter.  Therefore, her opinions based on this letter are struck.  \nLastly, the Plaintiffs argue that Dr. Shelley offers opinions on the law of agency.  According to \nthe Plaintiffs, the numerous references that she makes regarding Signal‘s role in the allegedly \nfalse promises made to the Plaintiffs is tantamount to an opinion on agency.  The undersigned \ndisagrees—Dr.  Shelley  does  not  offer  any  opinions  on  agency  law.    However,  as  will  be \ndiscussed below, such comments on the evidence are not helpful, and therefore, are struck from \nher report. \nb.  Helpful to the jury \n  The Plaintiffs raise two reasons for why Dr. Shelley‘s opinions are not helpful, and \ntherefore, inadmissible.  First, they argue that Dr. Shelley‘s opinions ―largely parrot Signal‘s \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 26 of 35 PageID #:  3239\ntheory of the case . . . .‖  (Doc. No. 73-1 p. 14.)  This is a fair characterization of much of Dr. \nShelley‘s report.  Large portions of her report read more like an opening statement than an expert \nreport.  For example, she ―opines‖ that: ―Signal did not obtain workers for its facilities in Texas \nand Mississippi through the use of force, fraud, or coercion‖ (Doc. No.  73, Ex. C, p. 9); ―Burnett \nmight have engaged in deceptive promises, but as the chronology presented by the plaintiffs in \nthe third amended complaint [demonstrates], Signal was not a part of any deceptive promises‖ \n(Id. at p. 18); ―Signal did not promise the workers green cards, nor did they learn that this \npromise had been made by the recruiters until after the workers arrived at Signal[‘s] facilities‖  \n(Id. at p. 19); ―The Indian H2B workers did not have their passports or visas confiscated‖ (Id. at \np. 38); and ―[i]n reviewing the thousands of Signal emails, I saw nothing in them reflecting any \neffort to economize on the workers or to shortchange them.‖  (Id. at p. 41.)  These are just a few \nexamples of many.   \nBecause Dr. Shelley‘s opinions are limited to those related to the general characteristics \nof trafficking, such commentary on what the evidence establishes will not be allowed.  To the \nextent that Dr. Shelley is going to opine that the facts of Chellen v. John Pickle Co., No. 02-cv-\n85 (N.D. Okla. 2002) is consistent with other known or recognized cases of human trafficking, \nthis is permissible.  The fact that Chellen is not referred to in the pleadings or was a case brought \nprior to the passage of 18 U.S.C. § 1595 does not mean that Dr. Shelley cannot use this case in \ndiscussing the general characteristics of human trafficking. \nc.  Reliability and methodology \n  The Plaintiffs next argue, ―[f]or many of her opinions, Dr. Shelley asks this Court to \nmake ‗scientifically unsupported leaps of faith in the causal chain‘‖ (Doc. No. 73-1, p. 11) \n(quoting Rider v. Sandoz Pharm. Corp., 295 F.3d 1194, 1202 (11th Cir. 2012)).  The Plaintiffs \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 27 of 35 PageID #:  3240\nidentify two particular instances.  First, they claim that Dr. Shelley supports her opinion that \nthere was no trafficking in this case by erroneously drawing a conclusion from a report done by \nthe Texas Task Force on Human Trafficking.  (Doc. No. 73-1, p. 11.)  Again, because Dr. \nShelley will only be allowed to opine about the general characteristics of human trafficking, and \nnot  whether  there  was  trafficking  in  this  case,  she  will  be  precluded  from  drawing  this \nconclusion.   \nThe Plaintiffs next argue that Dr. Shelley opines that the food at the ―man camp‖ was \n―adequate  in  quantity  and  was  nutritional,‖  and  she  reached  this  opinion  by  ―eating  at  a \ncommercial restaurant run by the caterers in New Orleans more than six years after the last \nIndian H-2B worker ate at the ‗man camp.‘‖  (Doc. No. 73-1, p. 12.)  This is not the type of \nrigorous analysis that is required of an expert.  Moreover, the quality of food at a restaurant in \nNew Orleans, years later, is in no way indicative of the quality of food at the ―man camps.‖  \nTherefore, such an ―opinion‖ is improper.  These are just two examples; Dr. Shelley offers \nnumerous ―opinions‖ that are reached through a less than rigorous analysis.10  Because her \ntestimony is limited to discussing the general features of human trafficking schemes, these \nportions of her report are no longer in the case.  However, because her report is replete with these \ntypes of remarks, the undersigned reiterates that any testimony given by Dr. Shelley at trial must \nmeet the requirements of Rule 702. \n \n \n                                                           \n10.  Dr. Shelley also opined, ―[e]xamining Slides 1, 2, and 3 of Signal‘s safety performance reveals that is \nhas an extremely low rate of accidents.‖  (Doc. No. 73, Ex. C, p. 35.)  As discussed above, reaching such a \nconclusion requires balancing Signal‘s safety record against identifiable standards.  See infra III.A.b.  Dr. Shelley \nhas not done this.  Likewise, she opines that:  ―I saw a photo of Khuttan‘s welding test as compared to those of \nothers and he was clearly an individual with inadequate or an absence of welding experience previously.‖  (Doc. No. \n73, Ex. C, pp. 22–23.)  Dr. Shelley is no way qualified to discuss the contents of a welding test, nor does she discuss \nhow she reached the opinion that this Plaintiff had inadequate skills.   \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 28 of 35 PageID #:  3241\nd.  Dr. Shelley improperly assesses the witnesses’ credibility \nThe Plaintiffs also seek to strike portions of Dr. Shelley‘s report where she assesses the \ncredibility of the witnesses.  (Doc. No. 73-1, pp. 15–16.)  Signal responds that Dr. Shelley is not \npassing on the witnesses‘ credibility, but rather, merely elucidating the bases for her opinions.  \nThe undersigned is not persuaded.  (Doc. No. 88, p. 16.)  Dr. Shelley spends several pages of her \nreport evaluating the Plaintiffs‘ testimony.  For example, she states that ―Kurian David‘s T-visa \napplication is full of incorrect statements‖ (Doc. No. 73, Ex. C, p. 21); ―Hemant Khuttan‘s \ndeclaration raises many questions as to its veracity and the validity of his complaints‖ (Id. at 22); \nand she notes an alleged contradiction in Sony Vadusevan-Sulekha‘s statement by stating that \n―the problem with his statement is that Signal never had any pictures of housing or residential \nfacilities on its website.  This is a fantasy not reality.‖  (Id. at p. 23.)  The jury, without the \nassistance of Dr. Shelley, can evaluate whether the Plaintiffs are being truthful.  Accordingly, \nsuch opinions are improper. \ne.  Conclusion \n  Much of Dr. Shelley‘s report consists of impermissible legal conclusions, advocacy, \nassessment of the witnesses‘ credibility, and unreliable and unfounded opinions.  However, Dr. \nShelley  does  devote  a  few  paragraphs  of  her  report  to  discussing  the  elements  of  human \ntrafficking generally, and she even opines that the Plaintiffs‘ expert does not identify all elements \nthat are ―central to labor trafficking.‖  (Doc. No. 73, Ex. C, p. 35.)  This portion of Dr. Shelley‘s \nreport is acceptable; the remainder of Dr. Shelley‘s report is not. \n  Therefore, for the reasons stated above, the Plaintiffs‘ ―Motion to Exclude the Testimony \nand Strike the Expert Report of Dr. Louise Shelley‖ (Doc. No. 73) is GRANTED IN PART.  \nDr. Shelley‘s testimony is limited to a discussion of the general elements and characteristics of \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 29 of 35 PageID #:  3242\nhuman trafficking.  She, however, may not opine on whether these Plaintiffs were victims of \nhuman trafficking, the credibility of the Plaintiffs, or offer her assessment of the facts of this \ncase. \nG.  The Plaintiffs‘ ―Motion to Limit the Testimony of Enrique Gonzalez, III‖ (Doc. No. 72)  \nSignal‘s  expert,  Enrique  Gonzalez  (―Gonzalez‖),  an  immigration  lawyer,  prepared  a \nreport addressing ―various immigration issues.‖  (Doc. No. 80, Ex. A, p. 1.)11  The Plaintiffs \nmoved to strike Gonzalez‘s opinion II and six other ―stray remarks.‖  (Doc. No. 72-1, pp. 4–7.)  \nSignal responded by arguing that Gonzalez was not ―retained to provide an opinion on plaintiffs‘ \nconduct in this case and concedes that he will not testify at trial to any individual plaintiffs‘ \nconduct, nor that of any plaintiffs collectively.‖  (Doc. No. 80, p. 1.)  Signal, however, claims \nthat  Gonzalez‘s  opinion  II  is  ―essential  for  the  development  of  [his]  subsequent  opinions \nregarding Burnett.‖  (Id. at pp. 1–2.)   \na.  Due to the severance and transfer of Signal’s cross-claims, Gonzalez’s Opinion II \nis no longer relevant \n \nThe  Plaintiffs  move  to  strike  Gonzalez‘s  Opinion  II,  which  is:  ―Foreign  nationals \n[seeking an H-2B visa] are considered to have committed immigration fraud if they deliberately \nconceal  their  intent  to  remain  permanently  in  the  United  States  from  a  U.S.  consular  or \nimmigration officer.‖  (Id. at p. 20.)  There is no cause of action in this case that centers on \nwhether the Plaintiffs committed immigration fraud.  While Signal may argue that the Plaintiffs \nin fact concealed their true intent, there is no need for expert testimony opining as to whether this \namounts to immigration fraud.  Moreover, the undersigned is persuaded that such testimony from \n                                                           \n11. The Plaintiffs attached three versions of Gonzalez‘s report, but do not argue that one version is the \noperative report for this case.  (Doc. No. 72, Ex. A.)  In turn, Signal attaches the report that appears to be drafted \nspecifically for this case.  (Doc. No. 80, Ex. A.)  Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, any citations to Gonzalez‘s \nreport are to this version.  \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 30 of 35 PageID #:  3243\nan expert could easily be construed by a jury that these Plaintiffs in fact committed immigration \nfraud, and therefore, has significant potential to confuse the jury. \n Signal‘s primary argument that Opinion II should not be struck is that it is ―essential for \nthe development of Gonzalez‘s subsequent opinions regarding Burnett.‖  (Doc. No. 80, pp. 1–2.)  \nThese  subsequent  opinions  relate  to  Signal‘s  cross-claims  against  Burnett  that  have  been \ntransferred to the Eastern District of Louisiana and, as such, are no longer a part of this case.12     \nAccordingly, the undersigned strikes Opinion II because it is irrelevant. \nb.  Other “stray remarks” are inadmissible \nThe Plaintiffs also move to exclude six other ―stray remarks‖ that they claim are aimed at \nthem and are impermissible.  Two examples are illustrative.  First, Gonzalez states: ―The intent \nby  the  foreign  nationals  and  other  companies  was  for  the  workers  to  remain  in  the  U.S. \npermanently.‖  (Doc. No. 80, Ex. A, p. 12.)  Second, by ―counseling foreign nationals to lie to \nimmigration officers about their intent to remain in the U.S., Mr. Burnett, as well as the foreign \nnationals, knowingly committed immigration fraud.‖  (Id. at p. 13.) \nIt appears that Gonzalez is inferring that the Plaintiffs committed these acts, even though  \nGonzalez unequivocally testified that he is not offering any opinions on the Plaintiffs‘ conduct.  \n(Doc. No. 72, Ex. B, 191:6–13.)  There is simply no other way to interpret his assertion that ―the \nforeign nationals‖ (i.e., the Plaintiffs) ―knowingly committed immigration fraud‖ by allegedly \nlying about their intent.  Therefore, to prevent any unnecessary confusion that Gonzalez is \nopining about the Plaintiffs‘ conduct, these remarks are struck.   \n \n \n                                                           \n12. No party moved to exclude Gonzalez‘s Opinions III-V.  Therefore, the undersigned expresses no \nopinion on whether these opinions meet Rule 702‘s ―helpfulness‖ requirement. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 31 of 35 PageID #:  3244\nc.  Conclusion \nThe Plaintiffs‘ ―Motion to Limit the Testimony of Enrique Gonzalez, III‖ (Doc. No. 72) \nis GRANTED.  Gonzalez‘s Opinion II and the six ―stray remarks‖ identified by the Plaintiffs are \nstruck.  \nH.  Signal‘s ―Motion in Limine to Exclude/Limit Testimony of Amy Mowl‖ (Doc. No. 76) \n  Signal moves to exclude or limit the testimony of the Plaintiffs‘ expert, Amy Mowl.  \n(Doc. No. 76.)  Mowl is an economist, and is currently on the faculty of the  Institute for \nFinancial  Management  and  Research  Business  School  in  Chennai,  India.    The  Plaintiffs \ndesignated Mowl to provide ―a culturally specific, socio-economic context to assist the jury in \nunderstanding the nature of the debts incurred by Plaintiffs in India to pay hefty recruitment fees \ncharged by Defendants.‖  (Doc. No. 86, p. 1.)  Signal seeks to exclude or limit Mowl‘s testimony \non three grounds: (1) she makes impermissible credibility determinations; (2) her testimony \nregarding suicide must be limited; and (3) ―Mowl uses insufficient information and unreliable \nprinciples or methods in forming her opinions.‖  (Doc. No. 76.) \na.  Credibility Determination \n  Signal argues that Mowl passes on the credibility of the Plaintiffs‘ statements, and that \nher ―opinions impermissibly regurgitate[] the Plaintiffs‘ testimony stamped with the imprimatur \nof her expertise.‖  (Doc. No. 76, p. 5.)  The undersigned disagrees with Signal‘s characterization \nof Mowl‘s approach.  Mowl testified that she received sworn statements made by the Plaintiffs, \nand because they were sworn, assumed they were true.  (Id., Ex. B, 46:19–47:16.)  In addition, \nwhen questioned about whether she examined the truthfulness of the Plaintiffs‘ statements, she \nsaid  she  did  not  because  they  were  consistent  with  what  she  knows  about  Indian  finance \nproducts.  (Id.)  This is not the same as opining that the statements are in fact true.   \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 32 of 35 PageID #:  3245\n \n  Signal attempts to argue that Mowl‘s opinions are similar to ones that were struck in Elat \nv. Ngoubene.  (Doc. No. 76, p. 5.)  In Elat, the expert weighed two competing sets of facts, and \nconcluded that the plaintiff‘s version of the facts was more credible than the defendants‘.  Elat, \n993 F. Supp. 2d at 513–14 (noting that the expert‘s ―evaluation of the truthfulness of Plaintiff‘s \nversion of the underlying events as compared to Defendants‘ is little different from the way that \njuries themselves determine credibility from conflicting testimony‖).  The expert then used the \nplaintiff‘s version of the facts as the basis for her opinion.  Id.  Mowl did not undertake such an \nanalysis.  She merely took the plaintiffs‘ statements at face value and felt she could because they \nwere consistent with what she expected based on her experience.  This is the same as forming an \nopinion based on documents produced in discovery.  \nb.  Testimony regarding suicide13 \nTo illustrate the effect that debts can have on people in India, Mowl discusses a recent \nwave of suicides by Indian farm workers.  (Doc. No. 76, Ex. A, pp. 15–18.)  Signal seeks to \nexclude this part of Mowl‘s report on two grounds.  First, Signal argues that her sources are \nfaulty.  Mowl‘s sources were Indian newspapers.  Signal has pointed to no reason why the \nreliability or truthfulness of these sources should be doubted.  Moreover, this type of challenge \ngoes to the weight that the fact finder should ascribe to the opinions, not their admissibility.  See \n14.38 Acres of Land, 80 F.3d at 1077 (―As a general rule, questions relating to the bases and \nsources of an expert‘s opinion affect the weight to be assigned that opinion rather than its \nadmissibility and should be left for the jury‘s consideration.‖).   \nSecond, Signal claims that Mowl has not offered any form of ―peer-reviewed or other \nauthoritative source‖ showing that suicide rates amongst the farming community are relevant or \n                                                           \n13.  Signal did not argue that such testimony may be unfairly prejudicial.  See FED. R. EVID. 403.  \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 33 of 35 PageID #:  3246\nsimilar to those amongst the non-farming community.  (Doc. No. 76, p. 6); see also Daubert, 509 \nU.S. at 592–93 (noting that one of the indicia of reliability is whether the expert‘s theory or \ntechnique has been subject to peer review).  While courts have struck expert testimony when \nthere is too large of an analytic gap, the undersigned does not find that such a gap exists here.  \nSee also Pipitone, 288 F.3d at 244 (discussing that ―the factors identified in Daubert may or may \nnot pertinent in assessing reliability‖).  Mowl does not need to show a direct correlation between \nfarm worker and non-farm worker suicide rates to draw an analogy.  Furthermore, Signal has \npointed to no studies that Mowl has ignored, and the undersigned finds it unlikely that such \nstudies have ever been conducted.  \nc.  Sufficiency of information and reliability of principles \nSignal next argues that Mowl has not reviewed sufficient information.  Signal faults her \nfor ―not consider[ing] the pay data produced by Signal as part of its ESI productions,‖ ―failing to \nrequest any banking records,‖ and not reviewing the deposition of Sachin Dewan.  (Doc. No. 76, \npp. 6–7.)  The undersigned‘s role, however, is to ensure that expert testimony is ―based on \nsufficient facts or data‖—not to ensure that an expert left no stone unturned.  FED. R. EVID. 702.  \nHere, after reviewing her report, the undersigned finds that Mowl has met this threshold.  Mowl \nlists  over  forty  sources  that  she  considered  in  drafting  her  report.    Also,  a  review  of  her \ndeposition  shows  that  she  had  cogent  reasons  for  choosing  not  to  review  certain  sources.  \nFurthermore, an argument that an expert ―did not review sufficient facts and data goes to the \nweight of [its] opinion, to be brought out in cross-examination and resolved by the jury, not to \nadmissibility.‖  Suzion Wind Energy Corp. v. Shippers Stevedoring Co., 662 F. Supp. 2d 623, \n667 (S.D. Tex. 2009).  \n \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 34 of 35 PageID #:  3247\nd.  Conclusion \nAccordingly, Signal‘s ―Motion in Limine to Exclude/Limit Testimony of Amy Mowl‖ \n(Doc. No. 76) is DENIED. \nIV. Conclusion \n  The undersigned finds as follows: \n  The Plaintiffs‘ ―Motion to Exclude the Testimony and Strike the Expert Report of Ronald \nJ. McAlear‖ (Doc. No. 70) is GRANTED IN PART.  McAlear may testify about general \nindustry practices and opine as to whether Signal‘s practices are consistent with these \ncustoms.  However, McAlear may not opine that Signal is a safe company or has an \n―exemplary safety record‖; \n \n  The Plaintiffs‘ ―Motion to Exclude the Testimony and Strike the Expert Report of Kevin \nFox Gotham‖ (Doc. 77) is GRANTED IN PART.  Dr. Gotham may opine about the \nstate of housing in the Gulf Coast region in general and the correlation between available \nhousing and attracting skilled workers (opinions A through D).  However, opinions E and \nF are struck, and he may not opine as to whether there was ―an acute‖ housing shortage in \nOrange, Texas, why Signal built the ―man camp,‖ whether the Plaintiffs were required or \ncoerced into living at the ―man camp,‖ or whether the ―man camp‖ actually benefited the \nPlaintiffs; \n \n  Signal‘s ―Motion to Exclude the Opinion Testimony of Clyde Payne‖ (Doc. No. 68) is \nGRANTED; \n \n  The Plaintiffs‘ ―Motion to Exclude the Testimony and Strike the Report of Ronald L. \nSignorino‖ (Doc. No. 71) is GRANTED; \n \n  Signal‘s ―Motion in Limine to Exclude/Limit Testimony of Florence Burke‖ (Doc. No. \n69) is GRANTED IN PART.  Burke‘s opinions shall be limited to those related to \ngeneral  characteristics  of  human  trafficking  schemes,  and  Burke  is  precluded  from \ntestifying as to whether these Plaintiffs were victims of human trafficking or in what \nways the facts of this case are similar to other known cases of human trafficking; \n \n  The Plaintiffs‘ ―Motion to Exclude the Testimony and Strike the Expert Report of Dr. \nLouise Shelley‖ (Doc. No. 73) is GRANTED IN PART.  Dr. Shelley‘s testimony is \nlimited to a discussion of the general elements and characteristics of human trafficking, \nand she may not opine on whether these Plaintiffs were victims of human trafficking, the \ncredibility of the Plaintiffs, or offer her assessment of the facts of this case; \n \n \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 103   Filed 06/26/15   Page 35 of 35 PageID #:  3248\n  The Plaintiffs‘ ―Motion to Limit the Testimony of Enrique Gonzalez, III‖ (Doc. No. 72) \nis GRANTED.  Opinion II and the six other identified ―stray remarks‖ identified by the \nPlaintiffs are struck;  \n   \n  Signal‘s ―Motion in Limine to Exclude/Limit Testimony of Amy Mowl‖ (Doc.

' \n  ' \nv.  '    1:13-CV-497 \n  ' \nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL L.L.C. et al  ' \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION DENYING DEFENDANT SIGNAL’S MOTION \nTO DISMISS (DOC. NO. 16) \n \n  This case is assigned to the Honorable Marcia Crone, United States District Judge, and is \nreferred to the undersigned United States magistrate judge to conduct all pretrial proceedings.  \n(Doc. No. 2.)  Before the undersigned magistrate judge is the “Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)” (Doc. No. 16) filed by Defendants Signal International, L.L.C., Signal \nInternational,  Inc.,  Signal  International  Texas,  G.P.,  and  Signal  International  Texas,  L.P. \n(hereinafter collectively referred to as “Signal”).  Because the Plaintiffs have pleaded enough \nfactual  content  to  draw  the  reasonable  inference  that  the  alleged  pendent  state  law  claims \noccurred in Texas Signal’s Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 16) should be denied. \nI.  Background \nA.  Procedural Background \n  On March 7, 2008, twelve individuals who were allegedly trafficked into the United \nStates filed a putative class action against the Defendants in the Eastern District of Louisiana \nasserting trafficking, RICO, civil rights, and state law contract and fraud claims.  See David v. \nSignal Int’l, LLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220 (E.D. La.).  That Court denied class certification;1 and, as \na result of this ruling, the Plaintiffs in the instant action filed suit in this District, where they were \n                                                        \n  1.  David v. Signal Int’l, LLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. Jan. \n3, 2012). \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 47   Filed 07/29/14   Page 2 of 9 PageID #:  785\nallegedly subjected to deplorable working conditions at a Signal facility in Orange, Texas.2  \n(Doc. No. 1.)  On August 7, 2013, the Plaintiffs filed their complaint in this court against the \nSignal  Defendants,  Malvern  C.  Burnett,  Gulf  Coast  Immigration  Law  Center,  L.L.C.,  Law \nOffices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C., Michael Pol, Global Resources, Inc., Sachin Dewan and \nDewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd.  (Id.)   \nB.  Factual Background    \n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, approximately 590 men, including the Plaintiffs, \nwere allegedly trafficked into the United States through the federal government’s H-2B guest \nworker program to provide labor and services to the Signal Defendants.  (Doc. No. 1, p. 1.)  The \nPlaintiffs claim they were lured to work for Signal through the fraudulent promise of legal and \npermanent work-based immigration to the United States for themselves and their families.  (Id., \np. 2.)  Subsequently, after coming to the United States, the Plaintiffs were allegedly subjected to \nforced labor and other serious abuses at Signal operations in Orange, Texas and Pascagoula, \nMississippi.  (Id., p. 3.)   \nII.  Jurisdiction  \n  The Plaintiffs seek recovery pursuant to several federal statutes.  For actions brought \nunder these statutory provisions, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon federal \nquestion jurisdiction.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1331; 29 U.S.C. § 216(b).  For the state law causes of \naction, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon supplemental jurisdiction.  See \n28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).  Venue is proper because the events giving rise to the above claims \noccurred within the confines of this District.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1391.   \n                                                        \n  2.  Maruthamuthu Mayavu is the only Plaintiff in this lawsuit who worked in Signal’s Pascagoula, \nMississippi facility as opposed to their Orange, Texas facility.  The Defendants did not move to dismiss on that \nbasis.    \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 47   Filed 07/29/14   Page 3 of 9 PageID #:  786\nIII.  Rule 12(b)(6) Standard \nRule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes dismissal of a complaint \nthat fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6).  A Rule \n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss “is viewed with disfavor and is rarely granted.”  Harrington v. State \nFarm Fire & Cas. Co., 563 F.3d 141, 147 (5th Cir. 2009).  When a court analyzes a Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion, it “accepts ‘all well-pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light most favorable to the \nplaintiff.’”  In re Katrina Beaches Litig., 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Martin K. \nEby Constr. Co. v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit, 369 F.3d 464, 467 (5th Cir. 2004)).  A court \nshould grant such a motion only when the complaint fails to contain “enough facts to state a \nclaim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 \n(2007).  A claim is plausible on its face “when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the \ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  “Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of \naction, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.”  Id. \nIV.  Analysis \n  Signal moves to dismiss the Plaintiffs’ pendent state law claims of fraud,  negligent \nmisrepresentation, and breach of contract pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  \n(Doc. No. 16, p. 1.)  Signal argues the “state law claims are implausible because the Complaint \nalleges that the facts from which they originate occurred abroad;” and, therefore, “the contention \nthat these claims are governed by state law is dubious.”  (Id.)   In addition, although not entirely \nclear, Signal also seems to contend that the complaint should be dismissed because the Plaintiffs \nfailed to meaningfully engage in a choice-of-law analysis in order to determine which, if any, \nstate’s law applies.  (Id., p. 9.) \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 47   Filed 07/29/14   Page 4 of 9 PageID #:  787\n  The Plaintiffs respond that their complaint adequately alleges facts that their state law \nclaims occurred in Texas and that Texas law applies to their claims.  (Doc. No. 23.)  Specifically, \nthe  Plaintiffs  argue  the  complaint  makes  clear  that  the  tortious  actions  originated,  were \nperformed, and continued to occur in Texas, specifically at the Texas Labor Camp located in \nOrange, Texas.  (Id., p. 5.)  The Plaintiffs allege that while recruiters working on Signal’s behalf \ninitially lured and defrauded the Plaintiffs abroad, Signal ratified the recruiters’ actions by \ncontinuing to defraud the Plaintiffs upon their arrival in Texas.   (Id.)  Lastly, the Plaintiffs argue \nthat a fact intensive choice of law analysis is premature given the sufficient facts that plausibly \nsupport the events centered around the Texas Labor Camp.  (Id., p. 4.)   \n  1.  State Law Claims that are “Extraterritorial in Nature” \nSignal’s argument that the complaint should be dismissed because the claims in question \nare “predicated on representations, statements and communications that took place in India” is \nwithout merit.  (Doc. No.  Id, p. 1.)  The complaint is replete with allegations that Signal \ncommitted the state law torts in Texas.  The following is a summary of the Plaintiffs’ complaint \n(Doc. No. 1):   \n  Defendant  Dewan  Consultants,  Defendant  Signal, \nDefendant Pol and Defendant Burnett induced Plaintiffs to enter \ninto employment agreements by falsely promising to help Plaintiffs \nobtain green cards.  In actuality, the Defendants lacked the intent \nto diligently pursue the Plaintiffs’ green card applications. They \nalso lacked any basis whatsoever for representing, inter alia, that 1) \nthe  companies  and/or  entities  that  purportedly  were  sponsoring \nPlaintiffs’ applications were financially solvent and had reliable \nand stable employment opportunities to provide the Plaintiffs; 2) \ngreen card applications sponsored by those companies would be \nvalid  and  bona  fide  under  U.S.  immigration  law;  and  3)  any \napplications were likely to be successfully completed and approved \nwithin the promised timelines.   \n  Once at the Texas Labor Camp, Signal ratified the actions \nof  the  recruiters,  breached  its  obligations  and  defrauded  the \nPlaintiffs regarding their immigration  status.   Defendant  Signal \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 47   Filed 07/29/14   Page 5 of 9 PageID #:  788\nsubjected Plaintiffs to skills testing and re-testing and persistently \nthreatened  Plaintiffs  with  on-the-job  discipline,  layoffs,  and \nperiods without work and pay.  Plaintiffs also were exposed to a \nwork environment in which they were forced to endure a lack of \nsafety  precautions,  unfavorable  job  assignments,  evaluation \nprocesses, and other adverse employment actions to which non-\nIndian  and  U.S.  citizen  workers  were  not  similarly  subjected.  \nFurthermore,  at  various  times  relevant  to  Plaintiffs’  claims, \nDefendant  Signal  refused  to  confirm  whether  valid  H-2B  visa \nextensions had, in fact, been obtained for Plaintiffs.  This coerced \nPlaintiffs to continue working for Signal in the hope that Signal \nwould  finally  resolve  their  uncertain  immigration  statuses.  On \nmultiple  occasions,  Plaintiffs  asked  the  Orange  camp  manager, \nwho was known as “Ravi,” about the statuses of their green cards. \nRavi, an agent of Defendant Signal, always told Plaintiffs that they \nhad  to  wait  without  giving  them  any  further  updates  or \ninformation.  Since first contracting with the Defendants in India, \nthe  Plaintiffs  have  yet  to  receive  the  green  cards  that  the \nDefendants promised them.  Despite clear contractual provisions \nrequiring them to do so, Defendant Dewan Consultants, Defendant \nPol,  Defendant  Burnett  and  Defendant  Signal  have  refused  to \nrefund any of the Plaintiffs’ money, which was paid to Defendants \nfor the express purpose of processing and obtaining green cards \nand visas for Plaintiffs, as Defendants had promised. \n \nIn the RICO fraud chart attached to their complaint as Exhibit 1, the Plaintiffs also allege \nthe following occurred after the Plaintiffs arrived in the United States: \nDefendant  Signal  told  Plaintiff  Meganathan  and  his  co-\nworkers  that  their  visas  and  green  cards  were  being  processed \nduring  an  in-person  meeting  at  Signal’s  Texas  facility.  \nSubsequently, Signal told Meganathan that all of the workers were \ngoing to be evaluated and scored and that not everyone would be \nreceiving visa extensions when their visas expired.  The scoring \nwas not explained, but only workers who scored higher than “six” \nwould receive an extension. \nDefendant Signal informed Plaintiff Narayanasamy that it \nwished to extend his H-2B visa through May 31, 2008, and that it \nhad  authorized  Defendant  Malvern  C.  Burnett  to  initiate  the \nprocess.  After Plaintiff Narayanasamy’s visa expired, he inquired \nas to actions that were being taken to secure his legal immigration \nstatus.  Again, Defendant Signal assured Narayanasamy that his \nvisa situation would be addressed.  Narayanasamy never received \nany notification that he had received his green card or that his H-\n2B visa was renewed. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 47   Filed 07/29/14   Page 6 of 9 PageID #:  789\nAt periodic Signal camp meetings, Defendant Malvern C. \nBurnett told Plaintiff Mayavu and his co-workers repeatedly not to \nworry about their green cards.  Defendant Burnett also represented \nthat he was applying for H-2B visa extensions for Plaintiff Mayavu \nand for others.  Subsequently, Plaintiff Mayavu and his co-workers \ninquired  about  extensions  to  their  soon  to  expire  H-2B  visas. \nDefendant Signal and Defendant Burnett informed them that they \nwere still on track to receive extensions. \nOn several occasions in 2007 Plaintiff Ramasamy inquired \nabout his green card status to Defendant Signal.  Defendant Signal \nrepeatedly told Plaintiff Ramasamy that the situation would be \naddressed.  After Plaintiff Ramasamy’s visa was allowed to expire, \nhe inquired about the action being undertaken to secure his legal \nimmigration  status.  Defendant  Signal  assured  Ramasamy  the \nsituation would be addressed. \n \nWhen deciding a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the court must consider these facts as true.  \nIn re Katrina Beaches Litig., 495 F.3d at 205.  From these allegations, the Plaintiffs have clearly \npleaded enough factual content to draw the reasonable inference that the alleged pendent state \nlaw claims of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract occurred in Texas.3  \nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662 at 678.   Even if the complaint alleges Signal’s actions and the Plaintiffs’ \ninjuries occurred in Texas and India, Signal has not cited to any persuasive authority that this \nsubjects the Plaintiffs’ entire complaint to a 12(b)(6) dismissal.  In fact, district courts have the \npower to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over foreign law claims that form part of the same \ncase or controversy.  In re BP p.l.c. Sec. Litig., 843 F. Supp. 2d 712, 799 (S.D. Tex. 2012) (citing \n28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)). \n2.  Choice of Law Analysis \nNext, Signal argues the complaint is defective because it does not address the factors that \nwould convince the court that Texas state law applies through a choice of law analysis.  (Id.)  A \n                                                        \n  3.   Signal briefly mentions that the complaint likely alleges the Plaintiffs incurred their damages in India, \nwhich “militates in favor of the conclusion that the applicable law is not state law.”  (Doc. No. 16, p. 23.)  However, \nas detailed in the complaint, the Plaintiffs not only suffered damages in India, but also Texas.  Signal allegedly \ncontinued to mislead, defraud and breach their contractual duties to the Plaintiffs once they were in Texas.  (Doc. \nNo. 1.) \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 47   Filed 07/29/14   Page 7 of 9 PageID #:  790\ncourt  has  discretion  to  exercise  jurisdiction  over  state-law  claims  when  federal  question \njurisdiction is proper and the state-law claims derive from a common nucleus of operative facts.  \nArena v. Graybar Elec. Co., Inc., 669 F.3d 214, 221 (5th Cir. 2012); 28 U.S.C. § 1367.  Federal \ncourts apply the forum state’s conflict-of-law rules to determine what law governs the state-law \nclaims.  Bailey v. Shell Western E&P, Inc., 609 F.3d 710, 722 (5th Cir. 2010), citing Klaxon Co. \nv. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 496 (1941).  Texas courts first determine whether there \nis a conflict between Texas law and another potentially applicable law.  Id. (citation omitted.)  If \nthere is no such conflict, a choice-of-law analysis is unnecessary.  Id. (citing SAVA gumarska in \nkemijska industria d.d. v. Advanced Polymer Sciences, Inc., 128 S.W.3d 304, 314 (Tex. App.—\nDallas 2004, no pet.)).  But, where there is a conflict of laws, Texas follows the “most significant \nrelationship” test of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws.  Id. (citing  Minn. Mining & \nMfg. Co. v. Nishika Ltd., 953 S.W.2d 733, 735 (Tex. 1997)).    \nSignal does not dispute the court has proper federal question jurisdiction over the pendent \nstate-law claims.  Signal argues the complaint is subject to dismissal because it does not explain \nwhy Texas law applies over Indian law.  (Doc. No. 16, p. 8-9.)  Signal does not cite, and the \nundersigned cannot find, any binding Fifth Circuit authority for a 12(b)(6) dismissal because the \ncomplaint fails to plead the particular state’s law at issue for the pendent state law claims.  \nNevertheless, Signal has not shown there is even a conflict of laws between Texas and Indian \nlaw.4  Without such a showing, a choice-of-law analysis is unnecessary.  Even if a choice-of-law \n                                                        \n  4.  Signal appears to argue that this court should dismiss the instant case because of the “foreign nature” of \nthe claims.  However, none of the cases cited by Signal are applicable to the instant case in which Signal allegedly \ncommitted torts within Texas that injured the Plaintiffs within Texas.  See e.g. Boureslan v. Aramco, Arabian Am. \nOil Co., 892 F.2d 1271 (5th Cir. 1990) (An American citizen brought a Title VII suit, alleging that while he was \nworking in Saudi Arabia the American corporation which employed him discriminated against him because of his \nrace, religion and national origin.); Coca-Cola Co. v. Harmar Bottling Co., 218 S.W.3d 671, 680-81 (Tex. 2006) (“It \nis an especially sensitive matter for a jurisdiction to extend its laws governing economic competition beyond its \nborders.”); E.E.O.C. v. Arabian Am. Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244 (1991) (A United States citizen brought a Title VII \naction against a United States employer, alleging that while he was working abroad, the employer discriminated \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 47   Filed 07/29/14   Page 8 of 9 PageID #:  791\nanalysis were required, there is no authority for dismissing a complaint under 12(b)(6) for failing \nto analyze in the complaint which state law controls under the “most significant relationship” test \npromulgated in the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws.  In any event, Signal’s choice-of-\nlaw argument is without merit.  As discussed previously, the Plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts \nto draw the reasonable inference that Signal’s alleged misconduct occurred in Texas, thereby \ninvoking Texas law to govern the state causes of action.  \nV.  Recommendation \n  For the reasons stated above, Signal’s “Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(b)(6)” (Doc. No. 16) should be denied. \nVI.  Objections \n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(c) (Supp. IV 2011), each party to this action has the \nright to file objections to this report and recommendation.  Objections to this report must (1) be \nin writing, (2) specifically identify those findings or recommendations to which the party objects, \nand (3) be served and filed within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this \nreport.  See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(c); Fed R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2).  A party who objects to this report \nis entitled to a de novo determination by the United States District Judge of those proposed \nfindings and recommendations to which a specific objection is timely made.  See 28 U.S.C. § \n636(b)(1)(c); Fed R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3).   \n  A party’s failure to file specific, written objections to the proposed findings of fact and \nconclusions of law contained in this report, within fourteen (14) days of being served with a copy \nof this report, bars that party from: (1) entitlement to de novo review by the United States \nDistrict Judge of the findings of fact and conclusions of law, see Rodriguez v. Bowen, 857 F.2d \n275, 276–77 (5th Cir. 1988), and (2) appellate review, except on grounds of plain error, of any \n                                                                                                                                                                                   \nagainst him because of his race, religion, and national origin.). \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 47   Filed 07/29/14   Page 9 of 9 PageID #:  792\nsuch findings of fact and conclusions of law accepted by the United States District Judge, see \nDouglass v.

' \n  ' \nv.  '    1:13-CV-497 \n  ' \nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL L.L.C., et al.  ' \n \nORDER SEVERING AND TRANSFERRING SIGNAL’S CROSS-CLAIMS  \nTO THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \n \nThis case is assigned to the Honorable Marcia Crone, United States District Judge, and is \nreferred to the undersigned United States magistrate judge for all pretrial matters.  (Doc. No. 2.)  \nPer the ―first-to-file‖ rule, and in the interests of judicial economy, the undersigned finds that \nSignal‘s cross-claims should be severed from the main action and transferred to the Eastern \nDistrict of Louisiana.   \nI. Background \nOn March 7, 2008, a putative class action was filed in the Eastern District of Louisiana on \nbehalf of over five hundred plaintiffs who were allegedly victims of human trafficking.  (See Doc. \nNo. 1, David v. Signal Int‘l, L.L.C., No. 2:08-1220 (E.D. La. March 7, 2008)).  The court in \nDavid denied class certification (as to all claims except the plaintiffs‘ FLSA claims), which caused \nthe putative class members to file suit in the district where their injuries allegedly occurred.  The \nPlaintiffs in this case filed suit in the Eastern District of Texas because they claim to have suffered \ntheir injuries at a Signal facility in Orange, Texas.  \nLike in David, the Plaintiffs in this case sued numerous defendants.  (See Doc. No. 1); \n(See also Doc. No. 1, David v. Signal Int‘l, L.L.C., No. 2:08-1220 (E.D. La. March 7, 2008)) \n(naming twelve defendants).  For convenience, the Plaintiffs grouped the Defendants into three \ncategories: ―Signal‖ (collectively, Signal International, L.L.C., Signal International Texas, G.P., \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 102   Filed 06/17/15   Page 2 of 5 PageID #:  3210\nSignal  International  Texas,  L.P.,  and  Signal  International,  Inc.),    ―Recruiter  Defendants,‖ \n(collectively, Global Resources, Inc., Michael Pol, Dewan Consultants Pvt., Ltd., and Sachin \nDewan), and ―Facilitator Defendants‖ (collectively, Malvern C. Burnett, Malvern C. Burnett \nA.P.C.,  and  the  Gulf  Coast  Immigration  Center,  L.L.C).    Also  common  to  both  cases  are \ncross-claims Signal filed against these defendants.  (Doc. No. 61, pp. 55–75.); (Doc. No. 60, \nDavid  v.  Signal,  Int‘l,  L.L.C.,  No.  2:08-1220  (E.D.  La.  May  9,  2008)).1   Signal  filed  its \ncross-claims in the David case in 2008, and filed its cross-claims in this case in 2014.  The \ncross-claims  in  David  were  recently  tried,  and  a  jury  returned  a  verdict  in  favor  of  the \ncross-defendants on each claim.  (Doc. No. 2387, David v. Signal, Int‘l, L.L.C., No. 2:08-1220 \n(E.D. La. April 27, 2015)).   \nIn addition to this case, there are four other cases pending in the Eastern District of Texas \ninvolving  these  same  Defendants  and  the  same  allegations  of  trafficking.    Signal  filed \ncross-claims in those cases as well.  In two of those cases—Samuel and Joseph—Burnett moved \nto have Signal‘s cross-claims transferred to the Eastern District of Texas under the ―first-to-file‖ \nrule.  The undersigned granted Burnett‘s motion, and no objections were filed.    \nII. Analysis \n―Under the first-to-file rule, when related cases are pending before two federal courts, the \ncourt in which the case was last filed may refuse to hear it if the issues raised by the cases \nsubstantially overlap.‖  Int‘l Fid. Ins. Co. v. Sweet Little Mex. Corp., 665 F.3d 671, 677 (5th Cir. \n2011) (citation omitted).  ―In such a case, the district court in which the later action was filed may \ndismiss, stay, or transfer the suit in order to avoid duplicative litigation and enforce the principle of \ncomity.‖  Carter v. Dep‘t of Veterans Affairs, 228 F. App‘x 399, 402 (5th Cir. 2007) (per curiam).  \n                                                   \n1.  In this case, Signal claims that is has suspended its cross-claims against defendant Michael Pol (Doc. No. \n61, p. 55 n. 1), and in David, Signal‘s claims against him have been dismissed.  (Doc. No. 1976, David v. Signal, Inl‘t, \nL.L.C., No. 2:08-1220 (E.D. La. Dec. 5, 2014)). \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 102   Filed 06/17/15   Page 3 of 5 PageID #:  3211\n―In deciding whether to apply the first-to-file rule, the Court must resolve two questions: (1) are \nthe two pending actions so duplicative or do they involve such substantially similar issues that one \ncourt should decide the subject matter of both actions, and if so, (2) which of the two courts should \ntake the case.‖  Datamize, Inc. v. Fid. Brokerage Servs., LLC, 2:03-CV-321-DF, 2004 WL \n1683171, at *3 (E.D. Tex. Apr. 22, 2004) (Folsom, J.) (citing Tex. Instruments v. Micron \nSemiconductor, 815 F. Supp. 994, 997 (E.D. Tex. 1993)).  ―Only the first issue is for the \nsecond-filed court to decide, however, for in this circuit, ‗[o]nce the likelihood of a substantial \noverlap between the two suits ha[s] been demonstrated, it [is] no longer up to the [second filed \ncourt] to resolve the question of whether both should be allowed to proceed.‘‖  Nabors Drilling \nUSA, L.P. v. Markow, Walker, P.A., 451 F. Supp. 2d 843, 845 (S.D. Miss. 2006) (alteration in \noriginal) (quoting Cadle Co. v. Whataburger of Alice, Inc., 174 F.3d 599, 605–06 (5th Cir. 1999)).  \nThe application or propriety of transfer under the first-to-file rule may be raised sua sponte.  \nStrukmyer, L.L.C. v. Infinite Fin. Solutions, Inc., No. 3:13-cv-3798, 2013 WL 6388563, at *5 \n(N.D. Tex. Dec. 5, 2013); Walker Grp., Inc. v. First Layer Comm‘ns, Inc., 333 F. Supp. 2d 456, \n460–61 (M.D.N.C. 2004).   \nThe undersigned finds that the first prong of the first-to-file rule is satisfied here.  Signal‘s \ncross-claims in David are not just similar or related to the ones in this case—they are virtually \nidentical.  White v. Peco Foods, Inc., 546 F. Supp. 2d 339, 342 (S.D. Miss. 2008) (―The \nfirst-to-file rule does not require that cases be identical, but merely that there is a substantial \noverlap in issues and parties.‖).  First, the only difference in the parties between the two cases is \nthat Signal sued an additional three Defendants in David (the ―Labor Broker Defendants‖) who are \nnot parties to this action.2  Compare (Doc. No. 61) with (Doc. No. 60, David v. Signal, Int‘l, \n                                                   \n2. Signal also filed a third-party claim against Zito Companies, L.L.C. that was dismissed.  (Doc. No. 391, \nDavid v. Signal, Int‘l, L.L.C., No. 2:08-1220 (E.D. La. April 7, 2009)). \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 102   Filed 06/17/15   Page 4 of 5 PageID #:  3212\nL.L.C., No. 2:08-1220 (E.D. La. May 9, 2008)); see also Save Power Ltd. v. Syntek Fin. Corp., \n121 F.3d 947, 951 (5th Cir. 1997) (―Complete identity of parties is not required for dismissal or \ntransfer of a case filed subsequently to a substantially related action.‖).  It is also worth noting that \nSignal‘s cross-claims are in no way impacted by the difference in the make-up of the plaintiffs in \neach case.    \nSecond, Signal asserted nearly identical cross-claims in each case.  The only variation is \nthat Signal asserted a claim for tortious interference with contract in David that it did not include \nhere.  In addition, beyond just pleading the same causes of action against the same defendants, \nresolution of Signal‘s cross-claims involves the same facts and raises the same issues in both cases.  \nIn contrast, the undersigned denied Signal‘s and Burnett‘s requests to transfer the Plaintiffs‘ \nclaims to the Eastern District of Louisiana in part because the Plaintiffs in this case worked at a \ndifferent facility than the plaintiffs in David, and as such, the proof and facts for the claims would \ndiffer between the two cases.  (Doc. No. 44.)  This is not the case for Signal‘s cross-claims.  \nAccordingly, the undersigned finds that there is substantial overlap between Signal‘s cross-claims \nin this case and those in David. \nTherefore, the proper course of action is to either transfer, stay, or dismiss Signal‘s \ncross-claims.  The undersigned perceives no benefit to merely staying these claims.  In fact, \nSignal‘s cross-claims were recently tried in David, and the parties are now arguing about the \npreclusive effect of that judgment.  In the interest of judicial economy, one court should decide \nthese claims and any related ancillary issues.   \n \n   \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 102   Filed 06/17/15   Page 5 of 5 PageID #:  3213\nAccordingly, the most efficient manner of resolving these claims is to transfer them.  But, \nin order to transfer just Signal‘s cross-claims, as opposed the entire case (including the Plaintiffs‘ \nclaims), Signal‘s cross-claims must first be severed from the main case.  Pursuant to Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 21, a ―trial court has broad discretion to sever issues to be tried before it.‖  \nBrunet v. United Gas Pipeline Co., 15 F.3d 500, 505 (5th Cir. 1994) (citing FED. R. CIV. P. 21); see \nalso United States v. O‘Neil, 709 F.2d 361, 366 (5th Cir. 1983) (noting that under Rule 21 a district \ncourt properly severed a party‘s counterclaims).  The undersigned has authority under Rule 21 to \nsever Signal‘s cross-claims even though no party has requested such relief.  See Brunet, 15 F.3d \nat 505; United States v. Nat‘l R.R. Passenger Corp., No. CIV.A 86-1094, 2004 WL 1335723, at *6 \n(E.D. Pa. June 15, 2004) (―Thus, while neither party has asked this Court to sever, Rule 21 permits \na court to sever claims sua sponte.‖).   \nIII. Conclusion \n  For the reasons discussed above, it is ORDERED that the Clerk of Court is DIRECTED \nto sever from this action Signal‘s cross-claims against cross-defendants Malvern C. Burnett, \nSachin Dewan, Dewan Consultants Pvt., Ltd., Global Resources, Inc. Gulf Coast Immigration Law \nCenter, L.L.C., Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C. and Michael Pol; and it is further \n  ORDERED the Clerk of Court shall TRANSFER Signal‘s cross-claims against Malvern \nC. Burnett, Sachin Dewan, Dewan Consultants Pvt., Ltd., Global Resources, Inc. Gulf Coast \nImmigration Law Center, L.L.C., Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C. and Michael Pol to \nthe Eastern District of Louisiana. \n \n  SIGNED this 17th day of June, 2015.\n_________________________\nZack Hawthorn\n5 \nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n ",

Because \n \nPage 1 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 44   Filed 07/16/14   Page 2 of 9 PageID #:  759\nthese  motions  and  corresponding  responses  are  for  all  intents  and  purposes  the  same,  the \nundersigned’s decision and reasoning on the motions pending in the instant suit will apply to the \ncorresponding motions filed in Marimuthu and Meganathan as well.  Id.    \n  Having considered the pending motions and the corresponding responses, the court denies \nthe Signal and Burnett Defendants’ motions to transfer pursuant to the first-to-file rule because \nthere is not a substantial overlap between the instant suit and Kurian David et al. v. Signal, Int’l, \nL.L.C. et al., the first filed suit.  See Civ. A. No. 08-1220 (E.D. La.). \nI.  Background \nA.  Procedural Background \n  On March 7, 2008, twelve individuals who were allegedly trafficked into the United States \nfiled a putative class action against the Defendants in the Eastern District of Louisiana asserting \ntrafficking, RICO, civil rights, and state law contract and fraud claims.1  See David v. Signal Int’l, \nLLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220 (E.D. La.).  That Court denied class certification;2 and, as a result of \nthis ruling, the Plaintiffs in the instant action filed suit in this District, where they were allegedly \nsubjected to deplorable working conditions at a Signal facility in Orange, Texas.3  (Doc. No. 39.)  \nOn August 7, 2013, the Plaintiffs filed their complaint in this court against the Burnett Defendants, \nthe Signal Defendants, Michael Pol, Global Resources, Inc., Sachin Dewan, Dewan Consultants \n                                                 \n  1.  The Plaintiffs presumably still have FLSA claims pending in the Eastern District of Louisiana.  (Doc. \nNo. 21, p. 10.) \n \n  2.  David v. Signal Int’l, LLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. Jan. \n3, 2012). \n \n  3.  Srinivasa Rao Gonna is the only Plaintiff in this lawsuit who worked in Signal’s Pascagoula, Mississippi \nfacility as opposed to their Orange, Texas facility. \n \n \nPage 2 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 44   Filed 07/16/14   Page 3 of 9 PageID #:  760\nPvt. Ltd., Indo-Ameri Soft L.L.C., Kurella Rao, J&M Associates of Mississippi, Inc., J&M Marine \n& Industrial, L.L.C., and Billy R. Wilks.  The Plaintiffs allege that some or all of the Defendants \nviolated the following federal statutes: 1) The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act \nof 2003; 2) Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act; 3) The Civil Rights act of 1866; \nand 4) The Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871.  (Id.)  In addition, the Plaintiffs bring state law fraud, \nnegligent misrepresentation and breach of contract claims against all of the Defendants.  (Id.)   \nB.  Factual Background    \n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, approximately 590 men, including the Plaintiffs, \nwere allegedly trafficked into the United States through the federal government’s H-2B guest \nworker program to provide labor and services to the Signal Defendants.  (Doc. No. 39, p. 2.)  The \nPlaintiffs claim they were lured to work for Signal through the fraudulent promise of legal and \npermanent work-based immigration to the United States for themselves and their families.  (Id., p. \n4.)    Subsequently,  after  coming  to  the  United  States,  the  Plaintiffs  were  allegedly  denied \nemployment or were subjected to forced labor and other serious abuses at Signal operations in \nOrange, Texas and Pascagoula, Mississippi.  (Id., p. 5.)   \nII.  Jurisdiction  \n  The Plaintiffs seek recovery pursuant to several federal statutes.  For actions brought \nunder these statutory provisions, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon federal \nquestion jurisdiction.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1331; 29 U.S.C. § 216(b).  For the state law causes of \naction, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon supplemental jurisdiction.  See \n \nPage 3 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 44   Filed 07/16/14   Page 4 of 9 PageID #:  761\n28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).  Venue is proper because the events giving rise to the above claims occurred \nwithin the confines of this District.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1391.  \nIII.  First to File Rule  \n  The Signal and Burnett Defendants move to transfer the instant case to the Eastern District \nof Louisiana pursuant to the First-Filed Doctrine.  (Doc. Nos. 14, 31.)  “Under the first-to-file \nrule, when related cases are pending before two federal courts, the court in which the case was last \nfiled may refuse to hear it if the issues raised by the cases substantially overlap.”  Int’l Fid. Ins. \nCo. v. Sweet Little Mexico Corp., 665 F.3d 671, 677 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting Cadle Co. v. \nWhataburger of Alice, Inc., 174 F.3d 599, 603 (5th Cir. 1999)).  “The first-to-file rule is a \ndiscretionary doctrine.” Jones v. Xerox Commercial Solutions, LLC, CIV. A. No. H-13-0650, \n2013 WL 3245957, at *2 (S.D. Tex. June 26, 2013) (quoting Cadle Co., 174 F.3d at 603).  The \nrule is utilized “to avoid the waste of duplication, to avoid rulings which may trench upon the \nauthority of sister courts, and to avoid piecemeal resolution of issues that call for a uniform result.”  \nSave Power Ltd. v. Syntek Fin. Corp., 121 F.3d 947, 950 (5th Cir. 1997).  The party wishing to \ntransfer the case has the burden to prove that transfer is warranted.  Jones, 2013 WL 3245957, at \n*2 (citing Sanofi–Aventis Deutschland GmbH v. Novo Nordisk, Inc., 614 F. Supp. 2d 772, 777 n. \n5 (E.D. Tex. 2009); VCode Holdings, Inc. v. Cognex Corp., No. 2:07–cv–138, 2007 WL 2238054, \nat *2 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 3, 2007); Buckalew v. Celanese, LTD., No. G–05–315, 2005 WL 2266619, \nat *1 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 16, 2005)).   \n  “In deciding whether to apply the first-to-file rule, the Court must resolve two questions: \n(1) are the two pending actions so duplicative or do they involve such substantially similar issues \n \nPage 4 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 44   Filed 07/16/14   Page 5 of 9 PageID #:  762\nthat one court should decide the subject matter of both actions, and if so, (2) which of the two \ncourts should take the case.”  Datamize, Inc. v. Fid. Brokerage Servs., LLC, 2:03-CV-321-DF, \n2004  WL  1683171,  at  *3  (E.D.  Tex.  Apr.  22,  2004)  (citing  Texas  Instruments  v.  Micron \nSemiconductor, 815 F. Supp. 994, 997 (E.D. Tex. 1993)).  “The first-to-file rule does not require \nthat cases be identical, but merely that there is a substantial overlap in issues and parties.”  White \nv. Peco Foods, Inc., 546 F. Supp. 2d 339, 342 (S.D. Miss. 2008).   \nIV.  Analysis \n  The Defendants argue there is substantial overlap between the instant case and the first \nfiled case, David.  (Doc. Nos. 14, 31.)  While there are similarities in the two cases, the \nundersigned finds that the two cases do not involve such substantially similar parties and issues \nthat one court should decide the subject matter of both actions. \nA.  Parties \n  There is some overlap between the parties in David and the instant case, but it is not \nsubstantial.  While all of the Plaintiffs in the instant suit are also plaintiffs in David, as explained \nbelow, they are only asserting FLSA claims in David, which they do not assert here.4  (Doc. No. \n21, p. 10.)  Conversely, none of the David plaintiffs asserting non-FLSA claims are parties in the \ninstant case.  (Id., p. 8)  The David defendants and the Defendants in this suit are not completely \nidentical, but for purposes of this analysis, the court finds that the difference is insignificant.  \nWhile the first-to-file rule does not require identical parties, see Save Power Ltd., 121 F.3d at 950, \n                                                 \n4.  Even if the Plaintiffs in this case were at one point putative class members in the David class action \nlitigation, they were never parties since the class was never certified.  See Smith v. Bayer Corp., 131 S. Ct. 2368, \n2379 (2011) (holding that it is erroneous to believe a nonnamed class member is a party to class action litigation before \nthe class is certified, or if certification is ultimately denied). \n \n \nPage 5 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 44   Filed 07/16/14   Page 6 of 9 PageID #:  763\n“the fact that the parties are different cuts against an argument for substantial overlap.”  Jones, \n2013 WL 3245957, at *4.  \nB.  Claims \n  Although the first-to-file rule also does not require the issues to completely overlap, “the \ncases should be more than merely related to support a motion to transfer when venue is otherwise \nappropriate.”  Buckalew v. Celanese, Ltd., CIV. A. No. G-05-315, 2005 WL 2266619, at *2 (S.D. \nTex. Sept. 16, 2005).  The instant suit and David are related to the extent that all of the claims \nasserted in this suit are also asserted by the different David Plaintiffs.  However, there is not \nsubstantial overlap among the claims in both suits.  As the District Court established in its opinion \ndenying the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification in David, each of the Plaintiffs’ claims \nrequire individualized proof as it pertains to that particular Plaintiff.  David v. Signal Int’l, LLC, \nCiv. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. Jan. 3, 2012).  Thus, not \nonly are each of the individual plaintiffs’ forced labor, trafficking, RICO and civil rights claims \ndifferent from one another in this suit, as explained below, they are entirely different from their \npending FLSA claims in David.  Therefore, the issues presented by the Plaintiffs here cannot be \nresolved in the David suit.  W. Gulf Mar. Ass’n v. ILA Deep Sea Local 24, S. Atl. & Gulf Coast \nDist. of ILA, AFL-CIO, 751 F.2d 721, 729 (5th Cir. 1985) (“. . . a district court may dismiss an \naction where the issues presented can be resolved in an earlier-filed action pending in another \ndistrict court.”).  \n \nPage 6 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 44   Filed 07/16/14   Page 7 of 9 PageID #:  764\n  1.  Forced Labor and Trafficking \n  The  success  of  each  Plaintiff’s  forced  labor  and  trafficking  claims  is  dependent  on \nindividualized factors.  The question in a forced labor case is “whether Defendants’ coercive \nconduct was such that it could overcome the will of the victim so as to make him render his labor \ninvoluntary.”  David, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247 at 77.  “This question cannot be answered \nvia  generalized  class-wide  proof  but  rather  must  be  answered  individually  based  upon \nindividualized proof.”  Id.  Similarly, with trafficking, “individual issues will play a significant \npart” because involuntary servitude is an essential element of the claim.  Id. at 80-81.   \n  2.  RICO Claims \n  The success of each Plaintiff’s RICO claim is also based on each individual’s experience \nbecause the Plaintiff will be “required to prove that the [Defendants] committed the predicate acts \nupon which they rely for the pattern of racketeering activity.”  Id. at 92.  As stated above, proof \nof the predicate acts of trafficking and forced labor are “all premised on coercion” and “cannot be \nmade without resort to individualized proof.”  Id.  Additionally, in order to prove the fraud-based \npredicate acts, each Plaintiff will “have to prove first-party reliance on the alleged fraud that was \ndirected at them,” because “the question of individual reliance [is] paramount to resolving whether \nPlaintiffs’ injuries were caused by a RICO violation.”  Id. at 105-06. \n  3.  Civil Rights Claims \n  The Plaintiffs are suing the Signal Defendants under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 for violating their \nrights to “enjoy and benefit from non-discriminatory employment relationships” with the Signal \nDefendants.  (Doc. No. 39, p. 62.)  In order to obtain compensatory damages under this claim, as \n \nPage 7 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 44   Filed 07/16/14   Page 8 of 9 PageID #:  765\nsought by the Plaintiffs, each “Plaintiff must prove actual injury to himself and that injury must be \nattributable to (caused by) the Defendant’s disparate treatment.”  David, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n114247, at *119.  For this reason, the outcome of each Plaintiff’s case will vary based on their \nindividualized experience. \n  4.  Violations of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 \n  The Plaintiffs allege that the Burnett Defendants violated the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1971 by \nviolating their right to be free from “forced labor, involuntary servitude, and trafficking in \npersons.”  (Doc. No. 39, p. 64.)  Forced labor, involuntary servitude, and trafficking all include \nan element of coercion, which requires an individualized analysis of each Plaintiff’s situation, as \nstated above.  David, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *128.   \n  As one can easily discern, none of the above causes of action involve substantially similar \nissues to the Plaintiffs’ FLSA claims pending in David, which include claims of violating the \nfederally mandated minimum wage laws.  The proof required for the FLSA claims and the \nremedies sought are distinct from the proof and remedies at issue in the instant matter.  Given that \nthere is not a substantial overlap of the claims between the David litigation and this case, and with \nthe exception of the Plaintiffs’ FLSA claims in David, none of the Plaintiffs in the instant suit and \nDavid overlap, the court’s denial of the Burnett Defendants’ motion to transfer will not result in \n“piecemeal resolution of issues that call for a uniform result.”  Save Power Ltd. v. Syntek Fin. \nCorp., 121 F.3d 947, 950 (5th Cir. 1997).   \n \nPage 8 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00497-MAC-ZJH   Document 44   Filed 07/16/14   Page 9 of 9 PageID #:  766\nV.  Conclusion \n \n  The court finds that the instant suit does not substantially overlap with the first-filed suit, \nDavid.  Accordingly, the Signal Defendants’ “Motion for Stay Pendente Lite and for Transfer \nPursuant to First Filed Rule” (Doc. No. 14), and the Burnett Defendants’ “Motion to Transfer \nVenue and Memorandum in Support” (Doc. No. 31) are DENIED.  As discussed previously, \nthese same motions filed in related cases—Marimuthu et. al v. Signal International L.L.C. et al., \n1:13-cv-499  (Doc.  Nos.  23,  36);  Meganathan  et  al.  v.  Signal  International  L.L.C.  et  al., \n1:13-cv-497 (Doc. Nos. 17, 12)—are also DENIED for the same reasons.   \n \nSIGNED this 16th day of July, 2014.\n   \n__________________________________________________\nZaacckk HHaawwtthhoorrnn\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n \nPage 9 of 9 \n \n ",
