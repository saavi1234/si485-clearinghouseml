    "summary": "<p>This case is part of the series of <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=33\">Signal International cases</a>. It is stayed during defendant's bankruptcy and settlement proceedings.</p><p>On Aug. 7, 2013, 16 Indian guestworkers filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas for harm suffered as a result of an allegedly fraudulent and coercive employment recruitment scheme. Plaintiffs filed this suit after District Judge Jay Zainey <a href=\"http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-LA-0010-0016.pdf\">denied class certification</a> on Jan. 3, 2012 in a related case, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14377\"><i>David v. Signal International</i></a>. The amended complaint, filed on behalf of 21 individuals, asserted claims under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (18 U.S.C. §1589 (forced labor) and 18 U.S.C. §1590 (trafficking)), the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act (18 U.S.C. §1962), the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. §1981), the Ku Kux Klan Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. §1985), the Thirteenth Amendment, as well as claims of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract. Plaintiffs were represented by the Equal Justice Center and the Transnational Worker Rights Clinic.</p><p>Plaintiffs were allegedly brought into the United States to provide labor and services to defendant Signal International. Signal was based in Pascagoula, Mississippi and was in the business of providing repairs to offshore oil rigs in the Gulf Coast region. One plaintiff worked in Pascagoula; the remaining plaintiffs worked at Signal's Orange, Texas site. The complaint alleged that plaintiffs paid defendant Signal's recruiters as much as $25,000 for travel, visa, and recruitment fees, but upon arrival in the United States found out they would not receive the green cards promised to them. Instead, Plaintiffs were forced to pay additional fees ($1050 per month) to live in racially segregated labor camps, and were subject to squalid living conditions and threats of both legal and physical harm if they complained about the conditions or decided not to provide labor. </p><p>In July 2014, U.S. Magistrate Judge Zack Hawthorn denied Signal's motion to transfer this case to the Eastern District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs in this case only overlapped with the <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14377\"><i>David</i></a> case insofar as their FLSA claims in the <i>David</i> case were concerned. Magistrate Judge Hawthorn found the similarity in issues in the cases not substantial enough to warrant transfer because the current venue was otherwise proper. </p><p>In June 2015, Magistrate Judge Hawthorn severed and transferred Signal's cross-claims against co-defendants (immigration attorneys, recruiters, and labor brokers) to the Eastern District of Louisiana.</p><p>Trial was set for December 2015. However, in July 2015, the Court stayed the case after Signal filed for bankruptcy. <i>In re Signal Int’l, Inc, et al.,</i> No. 15-11498 (Bankr. D. Del. July 12, 2015). As a part of the bankruptcy filings, the plaintiffs entered into a plan support agreement (PSA) which contemplated a settlement of the claims of this lawsuit against Signal entities through a consensual Chapter 11 plan proposed by Signal. The PSA, with a liquidation trust for distribution of settlement proceeds, became effective on Dec. 14, 2015.</p><p>In Dec. 2015, in the <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14378\">related EEOC case</a>, the EEOC announced that the parties had reached a <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/12-18-15.cfm\">settlement</a> for all cases, approved by the bankruptcy court. Signal would pay $5 million to 476 guestworkers through a claims process. All aggrieved individuals included in the litigation could receive relief in spite of the bankruptcy proceedings. Signal's CEO also issued an apology for its conduct.</p><p>In this case, the parties were to update the court every 120 days as to the status of the bankruptcy proceedings. The parties' report on July 5, 2018 noted that 20 of the 21 plaintiffs had reached a settlement with the Burnett (immigration attorney) defendants, and the remaining one plaintiff could not be located. The plaintiffs advised that they would be dismissing their claims against them soon because the Burnett defendants had met their obligations under the settlement. Plaintiffs requested the stay remain in effect as to the Signal defendants and Dewan (recruiter) defendants.</p><p>On August 24, 2018, Magistrate Judge Hawthorn issued a report and recommendation to dismiss without prejudice the one remaining plaintiff who did not respond to the court’s order. District Judge Ron Judge Clark adopted the report and recommendation on September 12, 2018 and dismissed this plaintiff without prejudice. </p><p>The case is ongoing as to the Signal defendants and Dewan defendants. As of August 2, 2020, there has been no changes in the docket. </p>",

No. 124] requiring the parties to file a notice every 120 days informing the \nCourt of the status of the Signal bankruptcy proceedings, hereby file this Status Report as of November 6, \n2017. \nAs noted in Plaintiffs’ and the Signal Entities’ prior notices [Dkt. No. 126, 127, 128], the Signal \nEntities filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code on July \n12, 2015.  In re Signal Int’l, Inc, et al., No. 15-11498 (Bankr. D. Del. July 12, 2015) in the United States \nBankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”).1  On November 24, 2015, the \nBankruptcy Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Confirming Debtors’ First \nAmended Joint Plan of Liquidation Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code [ECF No. 555] (the \n“Confirmation Order”), confirming the Signal Entities’ plan of liquidation, which implemented the plan \nsupport agreement among the Plaintiffs, the Signal Entities and certain other parties, for the settlement of, \ninter alia, the Plaintiffs’ claims against the relevant Signal Entities.  Pursuant to the Plan, a litigation trust \n(the “Signal Litigation Trust”) has been created for the distribution of the settlement proceeds.  That process \n                                                      \n1 The other entities are: Signal Ship Repair, LLC (Case No. 15-11499), Signal Int’l, LLC (Case \nNo. 15-11500), Signal Int’l Texas GP, LLC (Case No. 15-11501), and Signal Int’l Texas, L.P. \n(Case No. 15-11502).  By the Bankruptcy Court’s order, all five cases are being jointly \nadministered with the Signal Int’l, Inc. case.  In re Signal Int’l, Inc., No. 15-11498 (Bankr. D. \nDel. July 14, 2015), ECF No. 55. \nStatus Report     1 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 132   Filed 11/06/17   Page 2 of 4 PageID #:  3798\nremains ongoing, as the Signal Litigation Trust distributed Trust Claim Forms in February and the Plaintiffs \nhave 60 days from the distribution date to submit their claim forms, which deadline was subsequently \nextended through June 15, 2016.    \nThe Plan became effective on December 14, 2015 [Bankr. Dkt. No. 589].  As of that date, pursuant \nto the Confirmation Order, “any suit, legal action, or other proceeding … in any forum in the United States \nthat is released, stayed, or enjoined pursuant to Article XI of the Plan against or affecting any Released \nParty [the Signal Entities], shall be stayed, enjoined or otherwise prohibited from continuation as to any \nReleased Party.”  (Confirmation Order at 25.)   \nWith respect to the claims against the Burnett Defendants, twenty of the twenty-one Plaintiffs have \nreached a settlement with the Burnett Defendants. The Burnett Defendants have satisfied their obligations \nunder the agreement and the twenty participating Plaintiffs will agree to the dismissal of claims against the \nBurnett Defendants.  \nThe one Plaintiff that is not participating in the settlement with the Burnett Defendants is Srinivasa \nReddy Dalli. Plaintiffs’ counsel has been unable to locate Plaintiff Srinivasa Reddy Dalli to obtain his \nconsent to settle. In the related cases against Signal International, LLC  consolidated in the Eastern District \nof Louisiana under the case number 2:14-cv-02811-SM-DEK, Samuel, et al. v. Signal Int’l, LLC, et al., \nJudge Morgan of the Eastern District of Louisiana entered an order requiring Plaintiff Srinivasa Reddy \nDalli to communicate with counsel within sixty days of the August 5, 2016 order. Plaintiff Srinivasa Reddy \nDalli did not communicate with counsel and Judge Morgan entered a judgment dismissing with prejudice \nall pending claims Plaintiff Srinivasa Reddy Dalli had against the Dewan Defendants. See Plaintiffs’ Status \nReport [Dkt. No. 131]. Plaintiffs will file a motion to withdraw as counsel for Plaintiff Srinivasa Reddy \nDalli.  \nIn light of the status of Signal’s Bankruptcy and the settlement with the Burnett Defendants, the \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that the stay remain in effect as to the Signal Defendants and Dewan \nDefendants.   \n \nStatus Report     2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 132   Filed 11/06/17   Page 3 of 4 PageID #:  3799\nRespectfully submitted, this 6th day of November, 2017. \n \n   \n/s/ Christopher J.

Doc. No. 2.  On July 5, 2018, \nPlaintiffs’ counsel informed the court that they have been “unable to contact Plaintiff Srinivasa \nReddy Dalli over the course of the last year and several months,” despite numerous attempts.  See \nDoc. No. 134, at 1.  Because of the inability to contact Mr. Dalli, Plaintiffs’ counsel has filed a \n“Motion to Withdraw as Counsel for Plaintiff Srinivasa Reddy Dalli.”  Id.  On July 17, 2018, the \ncourt entered an order requiring Mr. Dalli to notify the court within thirty days whether or not he \nconsents to the motion to withdraw.  Doc. No. 136, at 1.  Mr. Dalli was warned that failure to \ninform the court within thirty days will result in dismissal of his claims without prejudice for failure \nto prosecute and comply with a court order, pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 41(b).  Id.  Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel was directed to serve the order on Mr. Dalli at his last known email and mailing addresses \n(id. at 2), and they did so on July 20, 2018.  See Doc. No. 137.  Because Mr. Dalli has not responded \nto the court’s order, his claims should be dismissed without prejudice, pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. \n41(b), for failure to prosecute and comply with a court order.   \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 138   Filed 08/24/18   Page 2 of 3 PageID #:  3821\nI.  Legal Standard \n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) authorizes a district court to dismiss an action for \nfailure to prosecute or for failure to comply with a court order.  Boudwin v. Graystone Ins. Co., \n756 F.2d 399, 401 (5th Cir. 1985).  “This authority flows from the court’s inherent power to control \nits docket and prevent undue delays in the disposition of pending cases.”  Id. (citing Link v. \nWabash, R.R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 629 (1962)).  The exercise of this power is committed to the \nsound discretion of the court.  Forney Engineering Co., 589 F.2d 243, 248 (5th Cir. 1979). \nII.  Analysis \n  By failing to communicate with his counsel over the course of one year and several months \n(see Doc. No. 134, at 1), Mr. Dalli has failed to prosecute his case.  By failing to respond to the \ncourt’s order (Doc. No. 136) requiring Mr. Dalli to notify the court of his position on the motion \nto withdraw, he has failed to comply with a court order.  Mr. Dalli was warned that his claims \nwould be dismissed without prejudice if he did not notify the court within thirty days.  \nIII.  Recommendation \n   The undersigned recommends that Mr. Dalli’s claims be dismissed without prejudice for \nfailure to prosecute and failure to comply with a court order, pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 41(b). \nIV.  Order \n  It is ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ counsel shall mail this Report to Mr. Dalli at his last known \naddress and email it to his last known email address within seven (7) days of this order.  Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel shall file a notice with the court when they have completed this task. \nV.  Objections \n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C) (Supp. IV 2011), each party to this action has the \nright to file objections to this Report and Recommendation.  Objections to this Report must (1) be \n2 of 3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 138   Filed 08/24/18   Page 3 of 3 PageID #:  3822\nin writing, (2) specifically identify those findings or recommendations to which the party objects, \n(3) be served and filed within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report; and \n(4) be no more than eight pages in length.  See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C); FED. R. CIV. P. 72(b)(2); \nE.D. Tex. Civ. R. CV-72(c).  A party who objects to this Report is entitled to a de novo \ndetermination by the United States District Judge of those proposed findings and recommendations \nto which a specific objection is timely made.  See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C); FED. R. CIV. P. \n72(b)(3).   \n  A party’s failure to file specific, written objections to the proposed findings of fact and \nconclusions of law contained in this Report, within fourteen (14) days of being served with a copy \nof this Report, bars that party from: (1) entitlement to de novo review by the United States District \nJudge of the findings of fact and conclusions of law, see Rodriguez v. Bowen, 857 F.2d 275, 276–\n77 (5th Cir. 1988), and (2) appellate review, except on grounds of plain error, of any such findings \nof fact and conclusions of law accepted by the United States District Judge.

As a result, Plaintiffs, towards whom the Defendants held a strong and pervasive racial \nanimus, suffered and continue to suffer some combination of financial ruin, desperate poverty, \nextreme emotional distress, loss of reputation, physical sickness and disease, loss of religious and \nethnic identity, suffering based on race and national origin, and forced separation from family \nand home.   \nINTRODUCTION \n2.  Plaintiffs,  Srinivasa  Rao  Kambala,  Srinivasa  Rao  Gonna,  Amandeep  Singh  Kang, \nSaravanan  Arunachalam,  Chandra  Sekhar  Dwadasi  Rama,  Antony  Antony  Valiyaparambil, \nHarbans  Singh,  Annadurai  Ruthiripathi,  Ponniah  Muthu  Kumar,  Mahendran  Periyasamy, \nMalkiah Paul, Harvinder Singh, Pradeep Kumar, Abdullah Keepurath Maideen, Francis Sequira, \nand Unnikrishna Pillai Balakrishna Pillai bring this  action to recover  for  the unlawful and \nfraudulent behavior by Defendants Signal International LLC, Signal International, Inc., Signal \nInternational Texas, G.P., and Signal  International  Texas,  L.P.  (collectively referred to  as \n“Signal”) and Signal’s agents, including Defendants Malvern C. Burnett, the Law Offices of \nMalvern C. Burnett, Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, LLC (collectively referred to as the \n“Legal Facilitator Defendants”), as well as Defendants Global Resources, Inc., Michael Pol, \nDewan  Consultants  Pvt.  Ltd.,  Sachin  Dewan  (collectively  referred  to  as  “the  Recruiter \nDefendants”), as well as Defendants Indo-Amerisoft, L.L.C., Kurella Rao, J & M Associates of \nMississippi, Inc., Billy R. Wilks, and J & M Marine & Industrial LLC (collectively referred to as \nthe “Labor Broker Defendants”).   \n Complaint    2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 3 of 70 PageID #:  3\n3.  Signal is a Gulf Coast based marine and fabrication company.  In the aftermath of \nHurricane Katrina, Signal set out to recruit several hundred foreign workers to work as welders \nand pipefitters in Signal’s Pascagoula, Mississippi and Orange, Texas facilities. \n4.  To assist in that process, Signal retained the Recruiter Defendants, Michael Pol and his \ncompany  Global  Resources,  Inc.  (“Global”),  a  labor  recruitment  firm  with  operations  in \nMississippi; Malvern C. Burnett, an attorney based in Mississippi and Louisiana; and Sachin \nDewan, a labor recruiter in India, to recruit workers on Signal’s behalf.  Signal also executed a \npower of attorney authorizing Dewan’s company, Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd., to recruit for \nSignal abroad.  \n5.  In addition, workers were recruited for Signal by the Labor Broker Defendants, Kurella \nRao and his company Indo-Ameri Soft, L.L.C.; and Billy R. Wilks and his company J & M \nAssociates of Mississippi, Inc, which was later succeeded by J & M Marine & Industrial LLC.  \n6.  The cornerstone of the Defendants’ scheme was the tantalizing prospect that Signal \nwould be able to hire a skilled workforce at effectively no cost by forcing the Plaintiffs and their \ncoworkers to foot the bill for their own recruitment, immigration processing, and travel.  Indeed, \nan  April  18,  2006  “Skilled  Worker  Recruitment  Agreement”  between  Signal  and  Global \nexpressly stated that the workers would be delivered at no cost to Signal and that all other \ncharges, expenses, and fees would be paid by the workers themselves or by Global, who in turn \nwould be reimbursed through deductions from the Plaintiffs’ wages.  In short, Defendants paid \nnothing; the future employees paid everything. \n7.  Defendants told Plaintiffs that because the permanent residency process could take up to \ntwo years to complete and Signal’s need for workers was immediate, Defendants would first \n Complaint    3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 4 of 70 PageID #:  4\nassist Plaintiffs in obtaining temporary work visas, known as H-2B visas, while simultaneously \napplying for green cards. \n8.  Lured by, and in reliance upon, Defendants’ fraudulent promises of legal and permanent \nwork-based immigration to the United States for themselves and their families, Plaintiffs plunged \nthemselves  and  their  families  into  debt  to  take  advantage  of  these  seemingly  promising \nopportunities. Plaintiffs incurred significant debts to pay mandatory recruitment, immigration \nprocessing, and travel fees charged by Defendants totaling as much as $10,000 to $24,000 per \nworker, equivalent to two to three years of an Indian welder’s salary working in India. Trusting \nthe veracity of the immigration and work benefits promised by Defendants, Plaintiffs further \nrelinquished stable employment opportunities in India and as guest workers in Africa, the Persian \nGulf and Singapore. \n9.   Defendants’  main  recruiting  agents  in  India  and  the  United  Arab  Emirates  held \nPlaintiffs’ passports and visas, and threatened, coerced, and defrauded Plaintiffs into paying \nextraordinary  fees  for  recruitment,  immigration  processing,  and  travel.  Several  Defendants \nfurther caused Plaintiffs to believe that if they did not work for Signal under the auspices of \ntemporary, Signal-restricted, H-2B guest worker visas, they would suffer abuse or threatened \nabuse of the legal process, physical restraint, or other serious harm. \n10. The false promises, collection of exorbitant recruiting fees, and strong-arm tactics of \nSignal  and  its  agents  were,  upon  information  and  belief,  authorized  by  Defendant  Signal. \nDefendant Signal knew of the exorbitant fees charged and the Plaintiffs’ green card expectations \nbefore  the  Plaintiffs  arrived  at  Signal’s  facility.  (See  Order  and  Reasons  Denying  Class \nCertification, at 33, Kurian David, et al. v. Signal International, LLC, et al., 2:08-cv-01220-SM-\nDEK,  (E.D.  La.  Jan.  4,  2012),  ECF  No.  1117.)

Upon Plaintiffs’ arrival in the United States, Defendant Signal required that Plaintiffs live \nin one of two guarded, overcrowded, and isolated labor camps located in Orange, Texas (the \n“Texas Labor Camp”) and Pascagoula, Mississippi (the “Mississippi Labor Camp”). Defendants \nfurther deceived Plaintiffs regarding their visa status, threatened Plaintiffs with arrest, loss of \nimmigration  status  and  deportation,  and  generally  perpetrated  a  campaign  of  psychological \nabuse, coercion, and fraud designed to render Plaintiffs afraid, intimidated, and unable to leave \nSignal’s employ. \n12. Defendant Signal subjected Plaintiffs to discriminatory and offensive mandatory room \nand board arrangements at the Texas Labor Camp and the Mississippi Labor Camp to which \nnon-Indian and United States citizen employees were not subjected. Moreover, Defendant Signal \nimposed  upon  Plaintiffs  discriminatory  job-related  requirements  and  adverse  terms  and \nconditions of employment on Plaintiffs to which non-Indian and United States citizen employees \nwere not subjected. Defendant Signal subjected Plaintiffs to an objectively hostile and abusive \nwork environment on account of Plaintiffs’ race and alienage. \n13. Plaintiffs assert claims against Defendants arising from violations of their rights under the \nVictims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (“TVPA”) (18 U.S.C. § 1581, et al.; the \nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”); the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 \nU.S.C. § 1981); the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. § 1985); the Declaratory Judgment \nAct (28 U.S.C. §2201); and claims for damages arising from fraud, negligent misrepresentation, \nand breach of contract. \n Complaint    5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 6 of 70 PageID #:  6\n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n14.

The Legal Facilitator Defendants engaged in a joint venture with Kurella Rao and Indo-\nAmeri Soft, L.L.C., described below, to conduct and carry out their shared business interests and \nactivities in India and the United Arab Emirates.

Defendant Indo-Ameri Soft, L.L.C., (“Indo-Ameri Soft”) a corporation organized under \nthe laws of Louisiana and headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana, with substantial business \ncontacts in Texas, is engaged in the business of recruiting and providing Indian laborers to \nUnited  States  companies  and  selling  opportunities  for  United  States  immigration  and \nemployment to such laborers. \n70.

Rao has substantial \nbusiness contacts in Texas. \n71. Defendant J & M Associates of Mississippi, Inc. (“J & M”), a corporation organized \nunder the laws of Mississippi with substantial business contacts in Texas, was at all relevant \ntimes engaged in the business of recruiting and  providing  Indian laborers to United States \ncompanies and selling opportunities for United States immigration and employment to such \nlaborers. \n72. Defendant Billy R. Wilks (“Wilks”) was the founder and general manager of J & M and \ncurrently acts as a consultant for the company. Wilks has substantial business contacts in Texas. \n Complaint    14 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 15 of 70 PageID #:  15\nWilks is personally liable for the conduct of J & M.  Discovery in the case of David, et al. v. \nSignal, et al., United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana (Civ. No. 08-1220 \nSM/DEK) (the “David Litigation”) has established that Wilks had full control and decision-\nmaking authority over J & M such that J & M and Wilks were alter egos of one another. \n73. Wilks is the founder of J & M. He incorporated it in 1996. The main corporate office of J \n& M is Wilks’s home. J & M, during the time relevant to this litigation, was entirely beholden to \nWilks for its business activity. Further, Wilks has testified that during the time relevant to this \nlitigation all of J & M’s decisions and policy changes would have to be approved by him. He was \nthe main decision-maker with regard to all of the company’s relevant business activity. Both \nWilks and his former lawyer describe Wilks as the only person who knows anything about the \ncompany and that it is indeed his company, although in fact Wilks’ sons participated in the \nconduct of the company. \n74. At some point prior to 2007, J & M was sued in unrelated litigation. In response to that \nlawsuit, Wilks set up a new corporation – J & M Marine & Industrial LLC (“J & M Marine”) – \nprimarily to avoid the litigation then pending against J & M, but also to continue the work that \nwas underway with J & M. \n75. Wilks used the contractual arrangements and relationships he had set up between J & M \nand the Recruiter Defendants to create profitable opportunities for his new J & M Marine entity. \nIn other words, Wilks harvested the value that remained in J & M and transferred it to J & M \nMarine with no regard to the independent corporate identity of J & M. Such a transition is not \nreflective  of  the  action  of  a  corporate  entity;  rather,  it  indicates  an  action  done  for  the \nconvenience and singular strategy of the principal, Wilks. \n76. In 2007, Wilks put J & M into dormancy. This purported change of corporate status was, \n Complaint    15 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 16 of 70 PageID #:  16\nupon  information  and  belief,  done  without  any  formal  shareholder  vote  or  board  member \nmeeting. Further, J & M is undercapitalized; it has, according to Wilks, approximately $300,000 \nin debt. Further, Wilks, in yet another indication of the absence of corporate formalities between \nhim and J & M, has represented to the Court in the David Litigation that he intends to borrow \nmoney so that he is able to personally fund J & M’s legal defense. \n77. J & M filed a “Notice to Dissolve/Revoke” with the Mississippi Secretary of State on \nSeptember 12, 2010, although it remained in good standing through December 2012 according to \nthe Mississippi Secretary of State’s Business Services website. \n78. In short, there is no independence between Defendant Wilks and J & M. J & M was \nsimply used as the corporate entity to facilitate Wilks’s personal business and that of his family. \nHe testified during his deposition in the David Litigation that he did everything for the company. \nIndeed, prior to incorporating J & M in 1996, Wilks was doing the exact same work, as the 100% \nowner, under a “doing/business/as” rubric. Once Wilks incorporated J & M in 1996, there was no \nchange to the company activity or purpose, and J & M certainly did not obtain an identity \nindependent from its founder. \n79. Once Wilks created J & M Marine, he simply shifted his employee, Nicole Homel-\nTellier, from J & M over to J & M Marine. As he had done with J & M, he listed himself as the \nregistered agent and his home address as the company’s principal address with the Mississippi \nSecretary of State. \n80. Both J & M and J & M Marine clearly share the same initials, which reference the same \nindividuals: John and Michael Wilks. \n81. Both corporations perform the same work: recruit laborers to then subcontract them out \nto other companies for a profit. Given both entities were in the same business and both operated \n Complaint    16 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 17 of 70 PageID #:  17\nout of the same address, it is likely that whatever assets were held by J & M (e.g., computers, \nprinters, etc.) were at the disposal of J & M Marine both during the time that both companies \nexisted and also once J & M was put into dormancy. \n82. More importantly, with respect to the “asset” crossover between the two companies, \nDefendant Wilks moved the laborers – plaintiffs and other similarly situated – from J&M, with \nwhich they contracted, over to J & M Marine. In other words, the very revenue source of J & M \nbecame the revenue for J & M Marine. \n83. In bringing the candidates over to J & M Marine, after they had signed contracts with J & \nM, Defendant Wilks was unequivocally holding J & M Marine out as the successor company of J \n& M. Further, this transition of recruits, in conjunction with avoiding the litigation then pending \nagainst J & M, exemplifies the taking of the benefits of the predecessor company while leaving \nits liabilities behind. Wilks acknowledges that J & M has a $100,000 judgment against it, an \nobvious liability that has not tracked across to J & M Marine. \n84. Throughout this Complaint, Plaintiffs refer to Defendants Indo-Ameri Soft, Rao, J & M, \nWilks and J & M Marine collectively as the “Labor Broker Defendants.” \nAll Defendants \n85. At all relevant times, Defendants Dewan, Dewan Consultants, Pol, Global Resources, \nBurnett, Burnett Law Offices and GCILC acted as agents of Defendants Signal, J & M, Indo-\nAmeri Soft and/or Rao for the purposes of recruiting, obtaining, contracting, transportation \nand/or providing Plaintiffs for labor or services. \n86. All Defendants acted together in a joint venture in committing the wrongful actions \ndescribed herein. \n87. The  actions  of  the  Recruiter  Defendants  and  Legal  Facilitator  Defendants  described \n Complaint    17 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 18 of 70 PageID #:  18\nherein were performed within the scope of their agency to Signal. \n88. Individually  and  through  their  agents,  associates,  attorneys,  and/or  employees,  all \nDefendants have significant contacts in or around Orange, Texas. \n89. At all relevant times, Defendants were “persons” within that term as defined by RICO, 18 \nU.S.C. § 1961(3). \n90. Upon information and belief, Defendants have been engaged in contacts with Plaintiffs, \nincluding recruiting, obtaining, labor contracting, providing immigration related services to, \ntransporting, harboring, providing and/or employing Plaintiffs. \n91. At all relevant times, Defendants operated enterprises engaged in interstate commerce or \nin the production of goods for interstate commerce. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nThe Recruitment Process \nRecruitment of the Plaintiffs and Other Workers \n92. Beginning  in  2003  and  continuing  through  2006,  Recruiter  Defendants  (Defendants \nDewan, Dewan Consultants, Pol, and Global Resources) placed ads in various newspapers across \nIndia  and  the  United  Arab  Emirates,  seeking  welders,  fitters,  and  other  marine  fabrication \nworkers on behalf of various U.S.-based companies and individuals, including Labor Broker \nDefendants (Defendants Indo-Ameri Soft, Rao, and J & M). \n93. Upon information and belief, Recruiter Defendants placed such ads in coordination and \nagreement with Legal Facilitator Defendants (Defendants Burnett, GCILC, and Burnett Law \nOffices), and Labor Broker Defendants. \n94. Upon information and belief, since at least December 2003 through at least mid-2004, \nLegal  Facilitator  Defendants  and  Labor  Broker  Defendants  frequently  communicated  and \n Complaint    18 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 19 of 70 PageID #:  19\nconsulted frequently via mail, fax, e-mail and/or telephone communications to coordinate and \ndirect Recruiter Defendants’ activities, including advertising efforts on behalf of Labor Broker \nDefendants. \n95. The advertisements placed by Recruiter Defendants promised that qualified candidates \ncould  obtain  legal  permanent  residence  (green  cards)  and  thereby  legally  and  permanently \nimmigrate to the United States with their families. \n96. In  response  to  these  advertisements,  Plaintiffs  contacted  Recruiter  Defendants  by \ntelephone, and/or attended meetings and testing sessions organized by Recruiter Defendants, \nLegal Facilitator Defendants, and Labor Broker Defendants and their agents, employees and/or \nrepresentatives at several locations throughout India and the United Arab Emirates. \n97. Specific facts relevant to the experiences of Plaintiffs are set forth in the “RICO Fraud \nChart” attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 1, which is incorporated herein by reference. \n98. Upon information and belief, prior to attending these meetings and testing sessions, \nLabor Broker Defendants, Recruiter Defendants, and Legal Facilitator Defendants conferred in \nlate 2003 and early 2004 by phone, mail, fax and or e-mail to organize, plan, and coordinate the \nlogistics and substantive content of these meetings and testing sessions.  \n99. In telephone communications, in-person meetings, faxes, contracts, and other written \ndocuments transmitted by mail and/or wire in the first half of 2004, Recruiter Defendants, Legal \nFacilitator  Defendants,  and/or  Labor  Broker  Defendants  personally  and  through  employees, \nagents  and/or  associates,  told  Plaintiffs  that  if  Plaintiffs  successfully  passed  skills  tests \nadministered in the United Arab Emirates or India and paid fees totaling approximately 4 Indian \nlakh rupees or 40,000 United Arab Emirates dirhams to 10 Indian lakh rupees (approximately \n$10,000 to $24,000), then Plaintiffs would be able to apply for permanent resident (green card) \n Complaint    19 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 20 of 70 PageID #:  20\nstatus in the United States with Labor Broker Defendants. \n100.  In  these  communications  occurring  during  the  first  half  of  2004,  Recruiter \nDefendants and Legal Facilitator Defendants further explained to many of the Plaintiffs, as \nreflected in the attached Exhibit 1, that the installment payments would be divided among \nRecruiter Defendants and Legal Facilitator Defendants. \n101.  In  these  communications  occurring  during  the  first  half  of  2004,  Recruiter \nDefendants, Labor Broker Defendants, and Legal Facilitator Defendants further explained to \nPlaintiffs that the installment payments would be divided among Recruiter Defendants, and one \nof the two Labor Broker Defendants. \n102.  In telephone communications, in-person meetings, faxes, written contracts, and/or \nother written communications, transmitted, upon information and belief, by mail and/or wire in \nthe first half of 2004, Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and Labor Broker \nDefendants instructed Plaintiffs that the total fees would be paid in a series of approximately \nthree installments. \n103.  In these conversations in the first half of 2004, Plaintiffs were informed on several \noccasions by Recruiter Defendants and/or Legal Facilitator Defendants that in exchange for an \nadditional fee of approximately $1,500 per family member, Plaintiffs would be able to obtain \nlegal permanent residence for their spouses and children. \n104.  At informational meetings and in telephone conversations, faxes, contracts, and \nother written documents transmitted in late 2003 through approximately mid-2004, Recruiter \nDefendants,  Legal  Facilitator  Defendants,  and  Labor  Broker  Defendants,  personally  and/or \nthrough their agents,  representatives, and/or  employees, represented to Plaintiffs that Labor \nBroker  Defendants  were  stable  and  reputable  U.S.  companies  offering  lawful  and  ample \n Complaint    20 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 21 of 70 PageID #:  21\nemployment opportunities, and that Labor Broker Defendants would obtain for Plaintiffs green \ncards enabling Plaintiffs to permanently and legally immigrate to the United States with their \nfamily members. \n105.  At informational meetings and in telephone conversations, faxes, contracts, and \nother written documents transmitted in late 2003 through approximately mid-2004, the Recruiter \nDefendants,  Legal  Facilitator  Defendants,  and  Labor  Broker  Defendants,  personally  and/or \nthrough their agents, employees and/or representatives, told Plaintiffs that the green card process, \nonce commenced, would be completed within18 to 24 months. \n106.  In such communications with Plaintiffs, Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator \nDefendants, and Labor Broker Defendants further promised to act diligently and do everything \nnecessary to obtain green cards for Plaintiffs in the timelines stipulated. \n107.  Based on these and other contractually-binding promises made to them regarding \ngreen cards and work opportunities in the United States, Plaintiffs signed contracts (hereinafter \n“the green card contracts”) at various times in early to mid-2004 with Recruiter Defendants, \nLegal Facilitator Defendants, and Labor Broker Defendants. \n108.  Contracts signed by Plaintiffs and other documents provided to the Plaintiffs by \nLegal Facilitator Defendants, Recruiter Defendants, and Labor Broker Defendants through the \nuse of mail and/or wire transmissions in and around early to mid- 2004, further promised that \nPlaintiffs  would  promptly  receive  a  refund  of  all  or  nearly  all  of  their  payments  if  these \nDefendants did not succeed in securing green cards for Plaintiffs as promised. \n109.  Legal Facilitator Defendants, Recruiter Defendants, and Labor Broker Defendants \nknew or should have known that they would not refund Plaintiffs’ money as promised in the \ncontracts and other documents. \n Complaint    21 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 22 of 70 PageID #:  22\n110.  Legal Facilitator Defendants, Recruiter Defendants and Labor Broker Defendants \ninduced the Plaintiffs to enter into the green card contracts: (a) without intent to diligently pursue \nPlaintiffs’  green  card  applications;  and  (b)  knowingly  without  any  basis  whatsoever  for \nrepresenting, inter alia: (i) that the companies and/or entities purportedly sponsoring Plaintiffs’ \napplications were financially solvent and had reliable and stable employment opportunities to \nprovide Plaintiffs; (ii) that green card applications sponsored by such companies would be valid \nand bona fide under U.S. immigration law; (iii) and that such applications were likely to be \nsuccessfully completed and approved within the promised timelines. \n111.  In reasonable reliance on Legal Facilitator Defendants, Recruiter Defendants and \nLabor  Broker  Defendants’  explicit  and  repeated  promises  regarding  green  cards,  family \nmembers’ ability to immigrate to the United States, and lawful and legitimate employment \nopportunities in the United States, Plaintiffs undertook considerable economic, social, familial \nand  personal  sacrifices,  including  payment  of  high  fees,  assumption  of  significant  interest \nbearing debt, loss of real and personal property, lost work opportunities, lost or unpaid wages \nand additional legal fees. \n112.  Plaintiffs  signed  contracts  with  Recruiter  Defendants,  Legal  Facilitator \nDefendants, and/or Labor Broker Defendants and made the first round of installment payments \nrequired by these contracts. \n113.  After  Plaintiffs  signed  contracts  with  Recruiter  Defendants,  Legal  Facilitator \nDefendants, and/or Labor Broker Defendants and paid the first installment payments required by \nthe contracts, these Defendants failed to provide Plaintiffs with updates regarding the progress of \ntheir green card applications for extended periods of time. \n114.  When Plaintiffs contacted Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, \n Complaint    22 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 23 of 70 PageID #:  23\nand/or Labor Broker Defendants by phone, mail, and/or e-mail at various times between the last \nhalf of 2004 and mid-2006 to check on the progress of their green card applications, these \nDefendants assured them that the green card process was going forward. \n115.  While  awaiting  the  processing  of  their  green  cards,  many  of  these  Plaintiffs \ncontinued to incur substantial interest on the money they had borrowed for the purpose of \nmaking the first installment payment to these Defendants. \n116.  In or around January 2006, Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants \nand  Labor  Broker  Defendants,  personally  and/or  through  their  agents,  employees  and/or \nrepresentatives notified Plaintiffs via telephone, e-mail, and/or mail communications that the \nlabor certification required for their green card applications had been approved by the U.S. \ngovernment. \n117.  After this notification, Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants and \nLabor Broker Defendants used wire and/or mail communications to collect the second and/or \nthird installment payments from the Plaintiffs. \n118.  By spring 2006, after the 18 to 24 month processing period promised by Recruiter \nDefendants,  Legal  Facilitator  Defendants,  and  Labor  Broker  Defendants  had  elapsed,  the \nPlaintiffs had still not received their green cards. \n119.  By spring of 2006, Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and Labor \nBroker Defendants had yet to refund Plaintiffs’ payments as promised by Plaintiffs’ green card \ncontracts. \n120.  In late May and early June of 2006, the Legal Facilitator Defendants, on behalf of \nDefendant Signal filed with the Mississippi Department of Employment Security, the Texas \nWorkforce  Commission,  and  the  United  States  Department  of  Labor  by  mail,  electronic \n Complaint    23 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 24 of 70 PageID #:  24\ntransmission, and/or fax the completed forms ETA 750 and attachments seeking permission to \nimport and hire 590 foreign guestworkers under the auspices of 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b), \nattendant regulations 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(6) and 20 C.F.R. § 655.3, and associated administrative \nletters and/or guidance (commonly known as “the H-2B guestworker program”). \n121.  Knowing that Signal’s labor need was projected to be at least two to three years, \nthe Legal Facilitator Defendants and Defendant Signal stated in these applications to the state \nworkforce commissions and forms ETA 750 that Signal would employ workers from October 1, \n2006 to July 31, 2007. These applications were furnished with signatures by Signal executives \nswearing, under penalty of perjury, to the veracity of the information in these applications. \n122.  Defendant Signal sought these workers to perform various jobs essential to its \nmarine  fabrication  services  business,  including  welding  and  fitting,  in  Orange,  Texas  and \nPascagoula, Mississippi. \n123.  On information and belief, Defendant Signal recruited these workers, including \nthe Plaintiffs, and offered terms of employment to these workers from its operations in Orange, \nTexas and Pascagoula, Mississippi. \n124.  The  H-2B  guestworker  program  permits  U.S.  employers  to  import  foreign \nworkers on short-term temporary visas to meet labor needs when employers attest that they \ncannot find U.S. workers to perform the available jobs in the local area where the employer seeks \nto employ the guestworker. \n125.  H-2B visas are non-immigrant visas, are only valid for work with the specific \nemployer  listed  on  the  visa,  and  do  not  provide  portable  and/or  transferable  employment \nauthorization for the visa bearer. \n126.  H-2B visas require employers to pay H-2B guestworkers a minimum wage, which \n Complaint    24 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 25 of 70 PageID #:  25\nis determined by, among other things, the location where the guestworker will work, the type of \nwork done by the guestworker, and the experience or skill level of the guestworker. \n127.  Defendant  Signal  stated  in  the  ETA  750  forms  that  its  need  for  H-2B \nguestworkers was “peak load and a one-time occurrence” and that “the temporary workers will \nwork for the length of the prescribed dates of need, will be paid in accordance with the prevailing \nwage, and will return to their home country at the end of employment.” \n128.  In the ETA 750 forms, Defendant Signal named Legal Facilitator Defendants as \nits  agents  for  the  purposes  of  preparing  and  submitting  these  applications  to  import  H-2B \nguestworkers. Legal Facilitator Defendants prepared and submitted these applications on behalf \nof Signal. \n129.  At the time of filing the ETA 750 forms and attachments with the Mississippi \nDepartment of Employment Security, the Texas Workforce Commission, and the United States \nDepartment of Labor, Defendant Signal and the Legal Facilitator Defendants knew that Signal \nprojected the labor need that it sought to fill with foreign workers to be at least two to three \nyears. \n130.  Defendant Signal and Legal Facilitator Defendants, at or around the time they \nfiled the ETA 750 forms in May and June 2006, repeatedly communicated by telephone, mail, e-\nmail, and/or fax to direct and coordinate recruitment of Indian workers to fill the anticipated H-\n2B guestworker jobs. Upon information and belief, Signal and/or Legal Facilitator Defendants \nrepeatedly communicated with Recruiter Defendants and Labor Broker Defendants by telephone, \nmail,  e-mail,  and/or  fax  to  direct  and  coordinate  recruitment  of  Indian  workers  to  fill  the \nanticipated H-2B guestworker jobs. \n131.  Upon information and belief, in the course of telephone, fax, e-mail and/or mail \n Complaint    25 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 26 of 70 PageID #:  26\ncommunications  occurring  in  or  around  May  or  June  2006,  Defendant  Signal  authorized \nRecruiter Defendants to act  as their agents in India  and the United Arab Emirates for the \npurposes of recruiting Indian welders and fitters to fill the anticipated H- 2B guestworker jobs at \nSignal operations. \n132.  Upon information and belief, in the course of these communications, Defendant \nSignal further authorized Recruiter Defendants and Legal Facilitator Defendants to represent that \nSignal would assume sponsorship of the pending and as-yet-unsuccessful green card applications \non behalf of, among others, Plaintiffs. \n133.  Upon information and belief, in the course of these communications, Defendant \nSignal further authorized Recruiter Defendants and Legal Facilitator Defendants to represent that \nSignal would apply for at least two to three H-2B visa extensions on behalf of all the Indian H-\n2B workers, including Plaintiffs, to allow them to remain in the United States working for Signal \nwhile Plaintiffs’ green card applications were being processed. \n134.  Defendant Signal authorized its agents to make these representations even though \nit knew or had reason to know that such visa extensions and green card applications would not be \nbona  fide  and  valid  under  United  States  immigration  law.  Moreover,  Defendant  Signal \nauthorized its agents to make these misrepresentations even though it did not have the intention \nat that time to apply for such visa extensions and/or green cards on behalf of all of the Indian H-\n2B workers, including Plaintiffs. \n135.  In July and August of 2006, with specific dates and assertions as set out in Ex. 1, \nthe Legal Facilitator Defendants on behalf of Defendant Signal filed with the United States \nCitizenship and Immigration Service by mail, electronic transmission, and/or fax the completed \nI-129 forms and attachments seeking 590 H-2B visas. \n Complaint    26 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 27 of 70 PageID #:  27\n136.  Knowing that Signal’s labor need was projected to be at least two to three years, \nin these H-2B visa applications Defendant Signal attested to a 10-month labor need running from \nOctober 1, 2006 – July 31, 2007. Signal falsely represented to the government that at the end of \nthis 10 month period, it intended to return all H-2B workers back to India. The Legal Facilitator \nDefendants declared that the applications were based on all information of which Defendant \nBurnett had any knowledge despite the fact that the Legal Facilitator Defendants believed that \nSignal’s intentions for these workers exceeded ten months. \n137.  In spring and summer of 2006, Plaintiffs who had already initiated the green card \nprocess spoke with Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and/or Labor Broker \nDefendants over the phone and in person regarding their long-pending green card applications. \n138.  In  these  communications,  Recruiter  Defendants,  Legal  Facilitator  Defendants, \nand/or Labor Broker Defendants offered Plaintiffs the opportunity to pursue their green cards \nunder the sponsorship of Defendant Signal. Plaintiffs were told that for an additional sum of \napproximately 35,000 to 45,000 rupees ($800 to $1,100), they could quickly obtain H-2B visas \nto go to the United States for work at Defendant Signal’s operations. \n139.  In  these  communications,  Recruiter  Defendants,  Legal  Facilitator  Defendants, \nand/or Labor Broker Defendants falsely assured Plaintiffs that Defendant Signal would seek at \nleast two extensions of the temporary H-2B visas with which Plaintiffs would gain admittance to \nthe United States, and that Plaintiffs’ H-2B visas would thereafter be converted to permanent \ngreen cards. \n140.  Upon  information  and  belief,  prior  to  these  communications  with  Plaintiffs, \nRecruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and Defendant Signal communicated and \nconsulted frequently via mail, fax, e-mail and/or telephone communications regarding the issues \n Complaint    27 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 28 of 70 PageID #:  28\nto be discussed and representations to be made to Plaintiffs. \n141.  In their communications with Plaintiffs, Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator \nDefendants, and/or Labor Broker Defendants further failed to disclose material facts regarding \nthe H-2B visa, including the fact that H-2B visas confer only a temporary non-immigrant status \nwhich does not allow the bearer to adjust to permanent residency status and the fact that applying \nfor H-2B visa status is fundamentally incompatible with simultaneously applying for a green \ncard. \n142.  Plaintiffs, unaware of U.S. immigration law and the temporary, nonimmigrant \ncharacter of H-2B visas and desperate not to forfeit the substantial fees that they had already \npaid,  agreed,  in  reliance  on  the  representations  of  Recruiter  Defendants,  Legal  Facilitator \nDefendants,  and/or  Labor  Broker  Defendants,  to  transfer  their  green  card  applications  to \nDefendant Signal’s sponsorship and further agreed to work for Defendant Signal under H-2B \nvisas pursuant to the terms explained by Recruiter Defendants. \n143.  In  reliance  on  the  representations  of  Recruiter  Defendants,  Legal  Facilitator \nDefendants,  Labor Broker Defendants  and Defendant  Signal,  Plaintiffs and others similarly \nsituated entered the United States on H-2B guestworker visas in late 2006 and early 2007 for the \npurposes  of  working  for  Defendant  Signal  at  its  Orange,  Texas  facility  or  Pascagoula, \nMississippi facility. \n144.  Plaintiffs  would  not  have  paid  the  extraordinary  fees  charged  by  Recruiter \nDefendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and/or Labor Broker Defendants for travel, green \ncards,  visas,  and  work  opportunities  had  they  known  that  these  Defendants’  promises  and \nrepresentations were false. \n145.  Plaintiffs would not have paid the extraordinary fees charged by the Recruiter \n Complaint    28 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 29 of 70 PageID #:  29\nDefendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and/or Labor Brokers Defendants for travel, green \ncards, visas, and employment opportunities had they known that these Defendants had failed to \ndisclose material facts concerning the nature and terms and conditions of the immigration and \nwork opportunities offered. \nPreparations and Departure for Signal Operations in the United States \n146.  At various times from the spring of 2006 to early 2007, employees of Defendant \nSignal traveled to various locations in India and the United Arab Emirates and tested Plaintiffs’ \nwelding and pipefitting skills in anticipation of employing them in the United States. \n147.  Plaintiffs paid costs necessary to travel to the cities where these tests were held. \n148.  Plaintiffs paid admission fees charged to take these tests. \n149.  Plaintiffs attended and passed these tests, which were overseen and graded by \nDefendant Signal’s and/or Defendant Dewan’s agents, employees, and/or representatives. \n150.  Upon  information  and  belief,  prior  to  attending  these  meetings  and  testing \nsessions, Defendant Signal, Recruiter Defendants, and Legal Facilitator Defendants conferred in \nspring, summer, and fall 2006 by phone, mail, fax and or e-mail to organize, plan, and coordinate \nthe logistics and substantive content of these testing sessions. \n151.  On or about July 20, 2006 and August 17, 2006, the United States Department of \nLabor approved Signal’s labor certification applications for 590 H-2B workers for the period of \nOctober 1, 2006 through July 31, 2007. \n152.  In approving these labor certification applications, the United States Department \nof Labor relied on the accuracy of the applications’ stated 10-month period of labor need. \n153.  On information and belief, the Department of Labor is prohibited by its internal \nguidelines to grant labor certification applications without relying on the application’s statement \n Complaint    29 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 30 of 70 PageID #:  30\nof temporary labor need. \n154.  In late  August  and  early  September 2006, the United States Citizenship and \nImmigration Service approved Signal’s H-2B visa petitions for 590 H-2B workers for the period \nof October 1, 2006 through July 31, 2007. \n155.  In approving these visa petitions, the United States Citizenship and Immigration \nService relied on the accuracy of the petitions’ stated 10-month period of labor need and the \nrepresentation  that Defendant  Signal’s need was based on a one time peak-load temporary \ndemand. \n156.  The  United  States  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Service  must,  according  to \nregulation, rely on the stated period of the petitioner’s labor need, see 8 C.F.R.214.2(h)(6)(ii)(B) \n(2006). \n157.  Defendant Signal, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and Recruiter Defendants knew \nthat the stated period of need in Signal’s applications for labor certifications and for H-2B visas \nwere inconsistent with Signal’s projected actual labor need and therefore Defendants knew these \nstatements to the government were false. \n158.  The Recruiter Defendants and the Legal Facilitator Defendants used the H-2B \nvisas, obtained from the U.S. Government on the basis of false statements by Defendant Signal \nand the Legal Facilitator Defendants, to elicit multiple installment payments Plaintiffs. \n159.  Plaintiffs entered the United States on H-2B guestworker visas, issued by the U.S. \nGovernment on the basis of false statements by Defendant Signal and the Legal Facilitator \nDefendants, in late 2006 and early 2007 for the purposes of working for Defendant Signal at its \nOrange, Texas or Pascagoula, Mississippi facility. \n160.  Around the time of USCIS’s visa approval, Plaintiffs made necessary preparations \n Complaint    30 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 31 of 70 PageID #:  31\nin order to travel to the United States on H-2B visas to work for Signal, including: paying to \nobtain necessary travel and legal documents; making payments to the United States consulate, \nRecruiter Defendants and Legal Facilitator Defendants for mandatory H-2B visa and consular \nprocessing fees; attending H-2B visa interviews; and paying Recruiter Defendants for travel \narrangements. \n161.  In order to secure H-2B visas to work for Signal, Plaintiffs were required to be \ninterviewed by United States Consular offices in Indian cities. \n162.  These consular interviews necessitated that Plaintiffs pay the costs of travel from \ntheir homes and/or current places of employment to various large Indian cities including Chennai \n(Madras), Delhi and Mumbai (Bombay). \n163.  Recruiter Defendants and/or Legal Facilitator Defendants, acting as Defendant \nSignal’s  agents,  required  that  Plaintiffs  meet  with  Recruiter  Defendants  and/or  the  Legal \nFacilitator Defendants in these Indian cities prior to attending their consular interviews. \n164.  Upon information and belief, prior to these meetings Recruiter Defendants and \nLegal Facilitator Defendants discussed amongst themselves and with Defendant Signal by e-\nmail, telephone, or in-person communications the topics to be discussed and instructions to be \ngiven to Plaintiffs and others similarly situated at these meetings. \n165.  At  these  pre-interview  meetings,  Recruiter  Defendants  and  Legal  Facilitator \nDefendants ensured that Plaintiffs were up-to-date on paying the fee installments required by \ntheir green card contracts. \n166.  Defendants further required that Plaintiffs pay an additional 35,000 to 45,000 \nrupees ($800 to $1,100) fee for H-2B visa processing. \n167.  On  information  and  belief,  Recruiter  Defendants  and/or  Legal  Facilitator \n Complaint    31 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 32 of 70 PageID #:  32\nDefendants required Plaintiffs to sign documents permitting Defendant Sachin Dewan to receive \ntheir visa stamped passports from the Consulate on Plaintiffs’ behalves. \n168.  Recruiter  Defendants  and/or  Legal  Facilitator  Defendants  also  coached  the \nPlaintiffs on what to say and what not to say during consular interviews. Those Defendants, inter \nalia, told Plaintiffs not to say anything about the substantial fees Plaintiffs had been required to \npay, not to say anything about expected green cards, and, if asked, to say that Plaintiffs expected \nto be in the United States for only several months and then would return to India. \n169.  Recruiter Defendants and/or Legal Facilitator Defendants told Plaintiffs that if \nthey did not follow these instructions regarding the interviews, Plaintiffs would not receive their \nvisas and would forfeit the all moneys they had previously paid to Defendants, in addition to \nlosing their opportunity to permanently immigrate to the United States. \n170.  During  Plaintiffs’  consular  interviews,  the  consular  officials  took  Plaintiffs’ \npassports from them. \n171.  Once Plaintiffs’ visas were approved, consular officials sent their passports, with \nH-2B visas affixed, directly to Defendant Dewan. \n172.  After receiving word that Plaintiffs’ visas were approved, Recruiter Defendants \nmade travel arrangements for Plaintiffs’ departures to the United States. \n173.  Before  Plaintiffs  could  leave  for  the  United  States,  however,  Plaintiffs  were \nrequired to attend final meetings in Recruiter Defendants’ Mumbai (Bombay) office. \n174.  Such  meetings  typically  took  place  mere  hours  before  Plaintiffs’  scheduled \ndepartures to the United States, when Recruiter Defendants’ office was teeming with anxious \nfellow Indian workers awaiting departure to the United States. \n175.  At  these  meetings,  Recruiter  Defendants  collected  final  installment  payments \n Complaint    32 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 33 of 70 PageID #:  33\nrequired by Plaintiffs’ green card contracts. \n176.  Recruiter  Defendants  also  required  that  Plaintiffs,  most  of  whom  do  not \nproficiently read or speak English, sign English language documents with little or no time for \nreview. \n177.  Recruiter Defendants refused to return Plaintiffs’ passports -- which had been in \nDefendant  Sachin  Dewan’s possession  since after Plaintiffs’ H-2B visas were  approved by \nConsular  Officials  --  until  after  Plaintiffs  had  paid  the  final  installments  and  signed  the \nmandatory paperwork. \n178.  In forceful tones, Recruiter Defendants or their staff demanded that Plaintiffs \nquickly sign the mandatory documents, lest they miss the flights to the United States which \nRecruiter Defendants had scheduled for them. \n179.  Without  possession  of  their  passports  and  within  this  rushed  and  hostile \natmosphere, Plaintiffs had no reasonable opportunity to review, negotiate, and/or make any \nchanges to the documents presented them. \n180.  On occasions when workers who appeared at the Mumbai office failed to present \nsufficient funds to pay the final installment required by the green card contracts, Defendant \nDewan and his associates threatened to destroy and/or deface these workers’ passports. \n181.  Such threats were uttered in the presence of other workers, causing these workers \nto reasonably believe that they had no choice but to pay the final installments in full. \n182.  Based on the Recruiter Defendants’ threatening and coercive behavior during \nthese pre-departure meetings in Mumbai and the extraordinary and increasing levels of debt they \nhad incurred to pay the Recruiter Defendants and Legal Facilitator Defendants for green card and \nH-2B visa arrangements, Plaintiffs reasonably believed that they had no choice but to make the \n Complaint    33 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 34 of 70 PageID #:  34\npayments required by the Recruiter Defendants and to travel to the United States to work for \nDefendant Signal. \n183.  Plaintiffs  and  approximately  560  other  Indian  H-2B  workers  traveled  from \nMumbai to Defendant Signal’s operations in the U.S. at various times from late October 2006 to \nJuly 2007 on tickets arranged by the Recruiter Defendants. \n184.  Pursuant to Defendant Signal’s instructions and arrangements, approximately 300 \nworkers, including one of these Plaintiffs, were sent to Signal’s Pascagoula, Mississippi facility, \nand approximately 290 workers, including these Plaintiffs, were sent to Signal’s Orange, Texas \nfacility upon arrival in the United States, although Signal’s Orange, Texas facility began turning \naway workers in or around February 2007. \n185.  The Plaintiffs had no choice but to use the Recruiter Defendants and the Legal \nFacilitator Defendants to secure employment at Defendant Signal’s operations. \n186.  The Plaintiffs had no choice but to pay the fees the Recruiter Defendants and the \nLegal Facilitator Defendants charged to secure employment at Defendant Signal’s operations. \n187.  Management personnel at Defendant Signal made the conscious and deliberate \ndecision  to  prohibit  the  Plaintiffs  from  securing  employment  at  Signal’s  operations  either \nthrough  another  recruiter  or  by  bypassing  recruiters’  altogether  and  applying  directly  with \nDefendant Signal. \nConditions at Signal Facilities in Orange and Pascagoula \n188.  Upon arrival at Defendant Signal’s facilities in Orange and Pascagoula, Plaintiffs \nwere shocked to discover that they were expected to live in isolated, overcrowded labor camps \ncomprised of trailer-like bunkhouses.  \n189.  Defendant Signal’s labor camps were located in isolated, industrial areas miles \n Complaint    34 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 35 of 70 PageID #:  35\nremoved from shopping areas, places of worship, and residential communities. The camps were \nenclosed by fences and accessible only by a single guarded entrance. \n190.  The  Signal  labor  camp  gates  at  the  Texas  and  Mississippi  facilities  were \nconstantly monitored by security guards retained by Defendant Signal. \n191.  Signal’s security guards monitored Plaintiffs’ comings and goings by requiring \nthem to show their employee identification badges and recording when Plaintiffs entered and \nexited the camps. Signal’s security guards also searched Plaintiffs’ packages and bags when they \nentered the camp. \n192.  Except on rare occasions, Plaintiffs were not permitted to receive visitors in the \nSignal labor camps. \n193.  Up to twenty-four Indian men were housed in each bunkhouse and made to sleep \nin two-tiered bunk beds. The bunk beds were so tightly packed in the bunkhouses that it was \ndifficult for workers to move about in the narrow passageways between bunks. These housing \nconditions,  inter  alia,  violated  the  applicable  health  and  safety  standards  under  the  federal \nOccupational Health and Safety Act. \n194.  The Signal labor camp bunkhouses had insufficient toileting and bathing facilities \nfor twenty-four men, resulting in long lines for the bathrooms before and after work shifts. \n195.  Privacy  was  non-existent,  and  Plaintiffs  often  experienced  extreme  difficulty \nsleeping due to the constant noise resulting from the close quarters and the comings and goings \nof workers who worked on different shifts. \n196.  Defendant Signal’s personnel and/or security guards conducted surprise searches \nof the dormitory areas of the bunkhouses, including searches of workers’ personal belongings. \n197.  Plaintiffs took their meals in Defendant Signal’s mess halls, which were only \n Complaint    35 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 36 of 70 PageID #:  36\nopen during limited hours. Due to filthy and unhygienic kitchen conditions, Plaintiffs frequently \nbecame ill, sometimes requiring hospitalization. \n198.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendant  Signal  did  not  obtain  the  required \npermit(s) to furnish the board at its Texas Labor Camp, and the condition and sanitation of the \nboard further violated federal, state, and/or local law including, inter alia, the U.S. Food and \nDrug Administration Code, as adopted and modified by Texas Food Establishment Rules.  In \naddition, the Mississippi Labor Camp violated Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(“OSHA”) guidelines on habitability. \n199.  Defendant Signal deducted labor camp fees of approximately $35 per day ($245 \nper week, or approximately $1,050 per month) from Plaintiffs’ paychecks for these substandard \naccommodations and meals. \n200.  When Plaintiffs complained and asked to live outside the labor camps, Defendant \nSignal initially refused and subsequently told workers that if they tried to live outside the camps \nSignal would still deduct the labor camp fees from Plaintiffs’ wages. As a result, Plaintiffs \nreasonably felt that they had no choice but to continue living in the Signal camps. \n201.  Defendant Signal only housed Indian H-2B workers such as Plaintiffs in its labor \ncamps, which employees and management at Signal referred to as the “reservation(s),” in a \nderogatory play on the common name (“Indian”) for Plaintiffs’ ethnicity and Native Americans. \nUpon information and belief, workers of non-Indian descent and United States citizen employees \nwere neither required nor allowed to  live in  and/or pay for  accommodations in  Defendant \nSignal’s labor camps. \n202.  Defendant Signal subjected Plaintiffs to skills testing and re-testing, on the- job \ndiscipline,  layoffs,  periods  without  work,  lack  of  safety  precautions,  unfavorable  job \n Complaint    36 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 37 of 70 PageID #:  37\nassignments, evaluation processes, and other adverse employment actions to which non-Indian \nand U.S. citizen workers were not similarly subjected. \n203.  In addition, Signal camp personnel and supervisors frequently subject Plaintiffs to \nan objectively hostile and abusive environment. They often used offensive language in speaking \nwith and/or referring to Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers and regularly insulted Plaintiffs \nand other Indian H-2B workers on the basis of their race, national origin, and/or alienage. \n204.  During the first week of employing Plaintiffs and others similarly situated in the \nUnited States, Defendant Signal did not reimburse Plaintiffs and others similarly situated for any \nof the expenses that Plaintiffs and others similarly situated were required to incur as a pre-\ncondition of seeking employment with Signal. \n205.  During the first two weeks of employing Plaintiffs and others similarly situated in \nthe United States, Defendant Signal deducted approximately $100 to $200 each week from \nPlaintiffs’ and other similarly situated workers’ checks for job-related tool kits which they were \nrequired to purchase from Defendant Signal. \n206.  Prior to and during the course of their employment at Defendant Signal, Plaintiffs \nand others similarly situated were not informed of the wage which they were legally required to \nbe paid as H-2B guestworkers, nor were they informed of their job classification. \n207.  During the course of their employment at Defendant Signal, Plaintiffs were not \npaid the wages required by the H-2B visa program.  \n208.  Over the course of their employment at Defendant Signal, Plaintiffs and others \nsimilarly situated were routinely awarded a fifty cent per hour “safety bonus” for workweeks \nwhen they were not written up for violations of Defendant Signal’s safety rules. \n209.  The safety bonus Defendant Signal paid the Plaintiffs and others similarly situated \n Complaint    37 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 38 of 70 PageID #:  38\nwas in addition to their regular hourly wage. \n210.  Upon information and belief, the safety bonus was non-discretionary with respect \nboth to the decision to pay the bonus and to the amount of the bonus. \n211.  Defendant  Signal  paid  the safety bonus to  the Plaintiffs and others similarly \nsituated pursuant to a prior agreement or promise causing the Plaintiffs and others similarly \nsituated to expect the bonus payments regularly if they met the required safety criteria. \n212.  During workweeks when the Plaintiffs and others similarly situated worked more \nthan 40 hours, Defendant Signal did not pay one and one-half times the amount of the safety \nbonus for all overtime hours worked. \n213.  Signal personnel and management regularly threatened Plaintiffs and other H-2B \nworkers that if they did not continue working for Signal, or did not work according to Signal’s \nspecifications, Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers would be deported back to India. \n214.  In the isolated and guarded atmosphere of the labor camp and grappling with the \ncrushing debts they had incurred to come to the United States, Plaintiffs reasonably felt that \nSignal’s statements were threatening and felt forced to continue working for Signal despite \nterrible working and living conditions. \n215.  At regular meetings and in one-on-one or small group conversations with Signal \ncamp  personnel  and  management,  some  workers,  including  some  of  the  Plaintiffs,  voiced \ncomplaints regarding the discriminatory treatment to which Indian H-2B workers were subject. \nOther similarly situated workers also voiced complaints, in both the Orange and Pascagoula \ncamps. \n216.  Workers  Vijayan  and  Kadakkarappally,  two  of  the  plaintiffs  in  the  David \nLitigation, took leading roles in gathering and voicing others’ complaints to Defendant Signal’s \n Complaint    38 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 39 of 70 PageID #:  39\npersonnel in camp meetings in Pascagoula. \n217.  When Indian workers, including Vijayan and Kadakkarappally, voiced grievances \nregarding  housing,  food,  and  wages,  Defendant  Signal’s  personnel  warned  them  to  stop \ncomplaining. \n218.  When Signal took no action in response to workers’ complaints, numerous Indian \nH-2B workers living at the Pascagoula labor camp, including Vijayan and Kadakkarappally, \nbegan meeting collectively to discuss how to persuade Signal to improve conditions in its labor \ncamps, and also began meeting with third parties to discuss how best to address their concerns. \n219.  Defendant Signal became aware of these meetings, including meetings between \nworkers, including Vijayan and Kadakkarappally, and third parties whom Signal believed to be \nattorneys. \n220.  Defendant Signal, through its employees and/or agents, contacted the Recruiter \nDefendants and Legal Facilitator Defendants to express its concerns about worker organizing \nefforts and the specific involvement of Vijayan and Kadakkarappally. \n221.  Upon information and belief, during these conversations Recruiter Defendants, \nLegal Facilitator Defendants, and Signal reached an agreement regarding steps that they would \ntake to discourage further worker organizing efforts and to ensure that the majority of the Indian \nH-2B workforce continued to work at Signal without complaint, as well as to prevent the Indian \nH-2B workforce from exercising their legal rights. \n222.  Upon information and belief, Signal management and camp personnel conferred \nand planned internally and with the private Swetman security firm in Mississippi to respond to \nworkers’ organizing activities and to take actions to ensure that the majority of the Indian H-2B \nworkforce continued to work at Signal without complaint, as well as to prevent the Indian H-2B \n Complaint    39 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 40 of 70 PageID #:  40\nworkforce from exercising their legal rights. \n223.  On or about March 7, 2007, Defendant Sachin Dewan called Vijayan’s wife at her \nhome in India and warned her that Vijayan must stop making trouble at Signal. \n224.  Vijayan’s  wife  informed  Vijayan  of  this  call,  and  Vijayan  called  Defendant \nDewan on or about March 8, 2007. During that conversation, Defendant Dewan told Vijayan that \nDewan had learned from Defendant Signal that Vijayan was organizing the workers and making \ntrouble. Defendant Dewan told Vijayan that if the organizing continued, all the workers would be \nsent back to India. \n225.  Vijayan  informed  other  Indian  workers  about  the  calls  he  and  his  wife  had \nreceived from Defendant Dewan, and word spread quickly through the Pascagoula and Orange \ncamps and to these Plaintiffs, regarding the threats against Vijayan. \n226.  News about the calls between Defendant Dewan, Vijayan and Vijayan’s wife \nsubstantially  heightened  the  reasonable  fears  of  Plaintiffs  in  the  Orange  camp  that  if  they \ncomplained  about  or  tried  to  leave  the  discriminatory  and  substandard  working  and  living \nconditions at Signal, the Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and Signal would \nretaliate against Plaintiffs or their families with acts of violence or by arranging for Plaintiffs’ \ndeportation to India. \n227.  Defendant Signal called a workforce-wide meeting on or about March 8, 2007 in \nthe Pascagoula camp, attended by Signal management and Defendant Burnett. \n228.  At this meeting, Signal management told the Pascagoula workers that Signal \nwould fight back against organizing efforts by the workers. \n229.  Signal management further threatened that Signal would not extend Plaintiffs’ and \nall other Indian H-2B workers’ visas if any of the workers took legal action against Signal. At \n Complaint    40 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 41 of 70 PageID #:  41\nthat same meeting Defendant Burnett told the workers that they were ineligible for other kinds of \nimmigration relief and could depend only on Signal to maintain their H-2B immigration status \nand pursue their green card applications. These threats were promptly reported to the workers in \nOrange, including Plaintiffs. \n230.  At or about the same time as this camp-wide meeting in Pascagoula, Mississippi, \nSignal  management  made  the  decision  to  terminate  and  forcibly  deport  Vijayan  and \nKadakkarappally, along with Kuldeep Singh, Kumar, and Chellappan, three Pascagoula workers \nwho are also plaintiffs in the David Litigation, and to do so by means that would make an \nexample of them for the other Indian workers in Pascagoula and in Orange, in order to keep \nthose workers in line. \n231.  Early on the morning of March 9, 2007, Signal locked the gate to its Pascagoula \nlabor camp, thereby obstructing the sole means of direct entry to and exit from the camp. \n232.  Around  this  same  time,  Signal  camp  coordinator  Darrell  Snyder,  and \napproximately five security guards, some or all of whom were obtained through the private \nSwetman  Security  firm,  swept  through  the  bunkhouses  carrying  pictures  of  Vijayan, \nKadakkarappally, K. Singh, Kumar, and Chellappan. \n233.  Security guards began accosting workers to determine whether they were the \nindividuals shown in the pictures. \n234.  Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers at both camps became increasingly \nfrightened and confused by these activities, particularly when word spread that Signal had locked \nthe gate that served as the sole exit from the Pascagoula labor camp. \n235.  Around 5:15 AM that morning, Vijayan was walking towards the dining area. A \nsecurity guard and Darrell Snyder, a Signal employee, aggressively confronted Vijayan and \n Complaint    41 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 42 of 70 PageID #:  42\ninstructed him that he was in their custody. \n236.  Based on the threats made at the meeting on March 8, 2007 and Vijayan’s recent \nphone call with Sachin Dewan, Vijayan feared what Defendant Signal might do to him. \n237.  Vijayan began to panic, thinking of the enormous quantity of money he had spent \nto come to the United States and the massive debts he owed in India. Vijayan knew that he \nwould not be able to repay such debts if he were deported and no longer employed by Signal. \n238.  These feelings, combined with Vijayan’s reasonable fear that Snyder and the \nsecurity guards might physically hurt him, drove Vijayan to attempt suicide. Vijayan had to be \ntransported from the labor camp to a local hospital for immediate medical attention. \n239.  While  attempting  to  assist  Vijayan  in  obtaining  medical  attention, \nKadakkarappally was grabbed by Darrell Snyder and/or one or more of the security guards. \n240.  Kadakkarappally was taken forcefully by the arm and marched into a communal \nroom in the labor camp referred to by workers as “the TV room.” \n241.  Upon arriving in the TV room, Kadakkarappally found two workers already held \ninside. Earlier that morning, Darrell Snyder and the security guards had grabbed Chellappan in \nthe communal eating area and Kumar in his bunkhouse and forced both of them into the TV \nroom, where they were kept under guard and prevented from leaving. \n242.  In the TV room, Darrell Snyder informed Kadakkarappally that he and Kumar \nand Chellappan were fired and would be taken to the airport to be deported to India. Snyder \ndemanded that Kadakkarappally stay inside the TV room, and Kadakkarappally was prevented \nfrom leaving the TV room by security guards. \n243.  Kuldeep Singh, upon realizing Snyder and the security guards were looking for \nhim and intended to apprehend and detain him, hid himself and later fled the camp via an \n Complaint    42 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 43 of 70 PageID #:  43\nadjacent work area. \n244.  Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan were detained in the TV room, under \nguard, from approximately 6 a.m. for several hours. \n245.  Several security guards watched over Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan \nwhile  they  were  detained.  Over  the  course  of  several  hours,  security  guards  denied \nKadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan’s repeated requests to be let out of the TV room, to get \nsomething to drink, or to use the bathroom. \n246.  When Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan’s co-workers attempted to come \ninto the TV room to talk to the three workers kept inside, the security guards pushed them back. \n247.  Confused and frightened, workers assembled outside the TV room to protest the \ntreatment of Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan. \n248.  At around 10 AM, Signal camp personnel finally permitted Kadakkarappally, \nKumar, and Chellappan to use the bathroom accompanied by security guards, one at a time. \n249.  Around noon, Darrell Snyder and a Pascagoula police officer entered the TV \nroom and the officer questioned why Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan were there. \nSnyder said that these workers had been fired and would be sent back to India. \n250.  By early afternoon on March 9, 2007, local media, religious advocates, and other \nindividuals had gathered outside the camp gate to express their concern over the attempted \nsuicide of Vijayan and the forced detention of Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan. \n251.  Faced  with  growing  protests  by  community  members  and  Signal  employees, \nDefendant Signal decided not to forcibly transport Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan to \nthe airport for deportation to India, and instead escorted them from the Pascagoula labor camp. \n252.  Other  Indian  H-2B  workers,  including  these  Plaintiffs,  working  at  Signal’s \n Complaint    43 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 44 of 70 PageID #:  44\nOrange facilities rapidly learned of the events at the Pascagoula labor camp on March 9, 2007. In \nresponse and out of fear for their continued well-being, some workers surreptitiously fled both \ncamps. \n253.  Within a few days of Plaintiffs’ and other Indian H-2B workers’ arrival at its \nlabor camps in late 2006 and early 2007, Signal personnel had conducted meetings at the labor \ncamps between Plaintiffs and representatives from specific banks. In Orange, these meetings \nwere with representatives from Capital One Bank.  In Pascagoula, these meetings were with \nrepresentatives from M&M Bank. \n254.  At  the  instruction  of  Defendant  Signal,  Plaintiffs  opened  accounts  with  the \ndesignated bank and agreed to directly deposit their wages in these accounts. Defendant Signal’s \nestablishment of Plaintiffs’ accounts with these banks gave it unique access to and control over \nPlaintiffs’ funds. \n255.  At some point before April 10, 2007, on information and belief, after some Indian \nH-2B workers had fled Signal’s Mississippi camp, the bank with which those workers had \nestablished similar accounts denied those departed workers access to their bank accounts and \ninvalidated their ATM cards. \n256.  Upon information and belief, that Mississippi bank refused the departed workers \naccess to their own bank accounts at Defendant Signal’s behest. \n257.  Indian H-2B workers still working at Signal labor camps, including the Plaintiffs, \nheard about the difficulty departed Signal workers had in accessing their funds through Signal-\nestablished bank accounts and reasonably believed that similar action might be taken against \nthem should they try to leave Defendant Signal’s employ. \n258.  The information about workers’ inability to access their money, combined with \n Complaint    44 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 45 of 70 PageID #:  45\nother factors described herein, contributed to the reasonable beliefs of Plaintiffs and the other \nremaining Indian H-2B workers that if they tried to leave the employ of Defendant Signal they \nwould face serious harm and/or threatened or actual abuse of the legal process. \n259.  Defendant Signal’s actions on and after March 9, 2007 significantly intensified \nthe reasonable fears of the remaining Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers in the Pascagoula \nand Orange camps that if they tried to leave Signal’s employ or oppose unlawful and coercive \nemployment conditions at Signal, including by consulting with counsel, they faced the threat of \nphysical restraint, detention, forced deportation, or other serious harms and/or abuses of the legal \nprocess. \n260.  Throughout the spring and summer of 2007, Signal personnel in the Mississippi \nand Texas camps held various meetings with the remaining Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B \nworkers to discuss the status of Plaintiffs’ and other Indian H-2B workers’ visas and green card \napplications. \n261.  Upon information and belief, during spring and summer 2007 Signal personnel \nconferred  amongst  themselves  and  with  the  Recruiter  Defendants  and  the  Legal  Facilitator \nDefendants via phone and/or e-mail to reach agreement on what should be said to workers \nattending the meetings. \n262.  Soon  after  March  9,  2007,  Defendant  Signal  held  a  camp-wide  meeting  in \nPascagoula. Signal personnel told the Indian H-2B workers that Signal would sponsor their green \ncards if they stayed at Signal and obeyed Signal’s rules, and warned that if workers held any \nmeetings against Signal’s interests, they would be terminated. As Signal understood would \nhappen,  workers  at  the  Orange  camp,  including  Plaintiffs,  promptly  learned  what  Signal \npersonnel had said at this meeting, and understood it would apply to workers at Orange, as well. \n Complaint    45 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 46 of 70 PageID #:  46\n263.  In that same time period, Defendants Dewan and Burnett came to the Signal camp \nin Orange, Texas and again promised, in the presence of Signal personnel, that Signal, through \nits attorney Defendant Burnett, would make bona fide applications for green cards and obtain \nseveral H-2B visa extensions for the workers who had not been terminated by Signal (plaintiffs \nin the David Litigation, including David, Sulekha, Thangamani, Kandhasamy, Khuttan, Andrews \nand Dhananjaya), and the other Indian H- 2B workers. Plaintiffs reasonably believed these \npromises. \n264.  In meetings and conversations in spring and summer 2007, Defendant Signal, \nthrough its agents and employees at the Pascagoula and Orange facilities, continued to promise \nthat Signal would arrange for the H-2B visa extensions and green cards originally promised \nPlaintiffs when they were recruited in India and the United Arab Emirates. \n265.  At the same time as Defendant Signal was promising to arrange for H-2B visa \nextensions and green cards for the Plaintiffs as well as other Indian H-2B workers, Signal in fact \nwas secretly evaluating all of the Indian workers with the intent not even to apply for visa \nextensions for certain of the Indian H-2B workers. \n266.  Plaintiffs’ continuing dependence on Defendant Signal for their present and future \nimmigration  status,  their  continuing  high  levels  of  indebtedness,  as  well  as  other  factors \nreasonably led Plaintiffs to fear serious harm and/or abuse of the legal process if they left \nSignal’s employ. \n267.  Under such circumstances, these Plaintiffs reasonably felt like they had no choice \nbut to continue working for Signal. \n268.  At  various  times  relevant  to  Plaintiffs’  claims,  Defendant  Signal  refused  to \nconfirm whether valid H-2B visa extensions had in fact been obtained for Plaintiffs, coercing \n Complaint    46 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 47 of 70 PageID #:  47\nPlaintiffs to continue working for Signal in the hope that Signal would finally resolve their \nuncertain immigration status. \n269.  In  addition,  during  the  spring  of  2007,  Signal  continued  to  recruit  workers, \nincluding some of the Plaintiffs, to fill positions under the H-2B visas which Signal had been \ngranted by the federal government.  As a result, the workers continued to pay recruitment fees \nwith the understanding they would have job opportunities at Signal.  The workers were told by \nRecruiter  Defendants  that  Signal  representatives  would  pick  them  up  from  the  airport  in \nHouston, Texas to work at Signal’s facility.  When the workers, including some of the Plaintiffs, \narrived at the Houston, Texas airport, no one from Signal was there to pick them up, and \nconsequentially no work opportunity was provided to them, as they had contracted for. \n270.  The workers, including some of the Plaintiffs, who had not been picked up at the \nairport, contacted Signal’s Orange, Texas facility to ask about their work opportunities and were \neither not responded to or told that there was no work opportunity for them at Signal. \n271.  The  workers  who  were  not  picked  up  at  the  airport,  including  some  of  the \nPlaintiffs, and who were stranded in a country foreign to them, overcame obstacles and received \nhelp from third-parties to travel to Signal’s Orange, Texas facility.  After they arrived there, \nSignal management told them that they needed to spend the night in the camp while Signal \nmanagement figured out what to do with the workers.  The next day, Signal management told \nthem that they had to take a test, which was the same test that they had taken previously.  After \ntaking the test, Signal management told the workers that they had failed the test.  Signal used the \ntest as a pretext for not employing the workers when Signal, at that point, had no intention of \nemploying the workers who Signal had recruited to the United States. \n272.  Signal  knew  it  had  no  intention  of  fulfilling  its  contractual  promises  and \n Complaint    47 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 48 of 70 PageID #:  48\nemploying the workers before the workers left India and made payments to Signal’s agents.  \nNevertheless, Signal did not inform the workers, including the Plaintiffs, of its intention to \nbreach the contract nor did Signal ensure that its agents informed the Plaintiffs that Signal would \nnot fulfill its contractual obligations.  Once the workers, including the Plaintiffs, arrived in \nTexas, Signal continued to defraud and lie about its intention to not fulfill its obligation to \nemploy the workers, including the Plaintiffs. \n273.  Since first contracting with Defendants in India and the United Arab Emirates, \nnone of Plaintiffs have yet to receive from Defendants the green cards Defendants promised \nthem. Despite clear contractual provisions requiring them to do so, the Recruiter Defendants, the \nLegal Facilitator Defendants, and the Labor Broker Defendants have refused to refund any of the \nmoneys Plaintiffs paid to them for unsuccessful green card and visa processing \n274.  The fact that the Plaintiffs gave up opportunities for work and financial gain by \nleaving India, Singapore, and the Persian Gulf to come work in the United States at Signal was \nknown or foreseeable to Defendants. \n \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nTHE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2003 \nForced Labor (18 U.S.C. § 1590 (trafficking with respect to \npeonage, slavery, involuntary servitude, or forced labor) \nDefendants Signal International LLC, Signal International, Inc., the Recruiter Defendants \n(Michael Pol, Global Resources, Sachin Dewan, and Dewan Consultants); and the Legal \nFacilitator Defendants (Malvern C.

Using  our  nation’s  guestworker  program  as  a  conduit,  the  Defendants  trafficked \napproximately 590 Indian men, including the Plaintiffs (as defined below) into the United States \nwith  the  aim  of  securing  inexpensive  and  exploitable  skilled  workers  to  perform  welding, \npipefitting,  and  other  marine  fabrication  work  at  plants  in  Orange,  Texas  and  Pascagoula, \nMississippi.  Having crossed that line, the Defendants then more deliberately deceived, defrauded, \nand intimidated the workers in an attempt to continue to benefit from their illegal scheme.  As a \nresult, Plaintiffs, towards whom the Defendants held a strong and pervasive racial animus, suffered \nand continue to suffer some combination of financial ruin, desperate poverty, extreme emotional \ndistress, loss of reputation, physical sickness and disease, loss of religious and ethnic identity, \nsuffering based on race and national origin, and forced separation from family and home.   \nINTRODUCTION \n2. Plaintiffs,  Srinivasa  Rao  Kambala,  Srinivasa  Rao  Gonna,  Amandeep  Singh  Kang, \nSaravanan  Arunachalam,  Chandra  Sekhar  Dwadasi  Rama,  Antony  Antony  Valiyaparambil, \nHarbans Singh, Annadurai Ruthiripathi, Ponniah Muthu Kumar, Mahendran Periyasamy, Malkiah \nPaul,  Harvinder  Singh,  Pradeep  Kumar,  Abdulla  Keepurath  Maideen,  Francis  Sequira, \nUnnikrishna Pillai Balakrishna Pillai, Srinivasa Reddy Dalli, Biju Kunjupanickan, Ramana Palika, \nNesamony Wilson Robi, and Ragukumar Chinnian bring this action to recover for the unlawful \nand fraudulent behavior by Defendants Signal International LLC, Signal International, Inc., Signal \nInternational  Texas,  G.P.,  and  Signal  International  Texas,  L.P.    (collectively  referred  to  as \n“Signal”) and Signal’s agents, including Defendants Malvern C. Burnett, the Law Offices of \nMalvern C. Burnett, Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, LLC (collectively referred to as the \n“Legal Facilitator Defendants”), as well as Defendants Global Resources, Inc., Dewan Consultants \nPvt. Ltd., Sachin Dewan (collectively referred to as “the Recruiter Defendants”), as well as \nThird Amended Complaint    2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 3 of 72 PageID #:  3500\nDefendants Indo-Ameri Soft, L.L.C., Kurella Rao, J & M Associates of Mississippi, Inc., Billy R. \nWilks, and J & M Marine & Industrial LLC (collectively referred to as the “Labor Broker \nDefendants”).   \n3. Signal is a Gulf Coast-based marine and fabrication company.  In the aftermath of Hurricane \nKatrina, Signal set out to recruit several hundred foreign workers to work as welders and pipefitters \nin Signal’s Pascagoula, Mississippi and Orange, Texas facilities. \n4. To assist in that process, Signal retained the Recruiter Defendants, Michael Pol and his \ncompany  Global  Resources,  Inc.  (“Global”),  a  labor  recruitment  firm  with  operations  in \nMississippi; Malvern C. Burnett, an attorney based in Mississippi and Louisiana; and Sachin \nDewan, a labor recruiter in India, to recruit workers on Signal’s behalf.  Signal also executed a \npower of attorney authorizing Dewan’s company, Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd., to recruit for \nSignal abroad.  \n5. In addition, workers were recruited for Signal by the Labor Broker Defendants, Kurella Rao \nand his company Indo-Ameri Soft, L.L.C.; and Billy R. Wilks and his company J & M Associates \nof Mississippi, Inc., which was later succeeded by J & M Marine & Industrial LLC.  \n6. The cornerstone of the Defendants’ scheme was the tantalizing prospect that Signal would \nbe able to hire a skilled workforce at effectively no cost by forcing the Plaintiffs and their \ncoworkers to foot the bill for their own recruitment, immigration processing, and travel.  Indeed, \nan April 18, 2006 “Skilled Worker Recruitment Agreement” between Signal and Global expressly \nstated that the workers would be delivered at no cost to Signal and that all other charges, expenses, \nand fees would be paid by the workers themselves or by Global, who in turn would be reimbursed \nthrough deductions from the Plaintiffs’ wages.  In short, Defendants paid nothing; the future \nemployees paid everything. \nThird Amended Complaint    3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 4 of 72 PageID #:  3501\n7. Defendants told Plaintiffs that because the permanent residency process could take up to \ntwo years to complete and Signal’s need for workers was immediate, Defendants would first assist \nPlaintiffs in obtaining temporary work visas, known as H-2B visas, while simultaneously applying \nfor green cards. \n8. Lured by, and in reliance upon, Defendants’ fraudulent promises of legal and permanent \nwork-based immigration to the United States for themselves and their families, Plaintiffs plunged \nthemselves  and  their  families  into  debt  to  take  advantage  of  these  seemingly  promising \nopportunities. Plaintiffs incurred significant debts to pay mandatory recruitment, immigration \nprocessing, and travel fees charged by Defendants totaling as much as $10,000 to $24,000 per \nworker, equivalent to two to three years of an Indian welder’s salary working in India. Trusting \nthe veracity of the immigration and work benefits promised by Defendants, Plaintiffs further \nrelinquished stable employment opportunities in India and as guest workers in Africa, Canada, the \nPersian Gulf and Singapore. \n9.  Defendants’ main recruiting agents in India and the United Arab Emirates held Plaintiffs’ \npassports and visas, and threatened, coerced, and defrauded Plaintiffs into paying extraordinary \nfees for recruitment, immigration processing, and travel. Several Defendants further caused \nPlaintiffs to believe that if they did not work for Signal under the auspices of temporary, Signal-\nrestricted, H-2B guest worker visas, they would suffer abuse or threatened abuse of the legal \nprocess, physical restraint, or other serious harm. \n10. The false promises, collection of exorbitant recruiting fees, and strong-arm tactics of Signal \nand its agents were, upon information and belief, authorized by Defendant Signal. Defendant \nSignal knew of the exorbitant fees charged and the Plaintiffs’ green card expectations before the \nPlaintiffs arrived at Signal’s facility.

Signal International, LLC, et al., 2:08-cv-01220-SM-DEK, (E.D. La. Jan. \n4, 2012), ECF No. 1117.) Far from taking any corrective measures, Defendant Signal ratified and \nperpetuated the scheme by continuing to facilitate the transportation of additional waves of Indian \nH-2B workers, including Plaintiffs, through April 2007. \n11. Upon Plaintiffs’ arrival in the United States, Defendant Signal fulfilled its promise to \nemploy only some of the workers which it had recruited.  For those Plaintiffs which were employed \nby Signal, Signal required that Plaintiffs live in one of two guarded, overcrowded, and isolated \nlabor camps located in Orange, Texas (the “Texas Labor Camp”) and Pascagoula, Mississippi (the \n“Mississippi Labor Camp”). Defendants further deceived Plaintiffs regarding their visa status, \nthreatened  Plaintiffs  with  arrest,  loss  of  immigration  status  and  deportation,  and  generally \nperpetrated a campaign of psychological abuse, coercion, and fraud designed to render Plaintiffs \nafraid, intimidated, and unable to leave Signal’s employ. \n12. Defendant Signal subjected Plaintiffs to discriminatory and offensive mandatory room and \nboard arrangements at the Texas Labor Camp and the Mississippi Labor Camp to which non-\nIndian and United States citizen employees were not subjected. Moreover, Defendant Signal \nimposed upon Plaintiffs discriminatory job-related requirements and adverse terms and conditions \nof employment on Plaintiffs to which non-Indian and United States citizen employees were not \nsubjected. Defendant Signal subjected Plaintiffs to an objectively hostile and abusive work \nenvironment on account of Plaintiffs’ race and alienage. \n13. Furthermore, Defendant Signal recruited some Plaintiffs and did not fulfill its promise to \nemploy them.  Signal continued to recruit these Plaintiffs knowing that it did not intend to employ \nthese Plaintiffs.   Signal knew the Plaintiffs had incurred substantial debt, given up stable jobs, and \ntravelled half-way across the world.  Signal knew or should have known that the Plaintiffs arrived \nThird Amended Complaint    5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 6 of 72 PageID #:  3503\nat airports in the United States expecting to be picked up by Signal representatives and Signal did \nnot pick them up or notify them that no one was coming to pick them up.  Signal’s refusal to \nemploy Plaintiffs was in direct contrast to promises Signal made to the United States government \nin its petition for H-2B visas, and to promises Signal made to the Plaintiffs themselves during the \nrecruitment process, and, furthermore, was done because Plaintiffs were Indian nationals.  \n14. Plaintiffs assert claims against Defendants arising from violations of their rights under the \nVictims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (“TVPA”) (18 U.S.C. § 1581, et al.); the \nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”); the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 \nU.S.C. § 1981); the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. § 1985); the Declaratory Judgment Act \n(28 U.S.C. §2201); and claims for damages arising from fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and \nbreach of contract. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n15.

Defendant Kurella Rao (“Rao”) is the Chairman and Director of Indo-Ameri Soft, L.L.C., \nand maintains offices in the New Orleans, Louisiana metropolitan area. Rao has substantial \nbusiness contacts in Texas. \n78. Defendant J & M Associates of Mississippi, Inc. (“J & M”), a corporation organized under \nthe laws of Mississippi with substantial business contacts in Texas, was at all relevant times \nengaged in the business of recruiting and providing Indian laborers to United States companies \nand selling opportunities for United States immigration and employment to such laborers. \n79. Defendant Billy R. Wilks (“Wilks”) was the founder and general manager of J & M and \ncurrently acts as a consultant for the company. Wilks has substantial business contacts in Texas. \nWilks is personally liable for the conduct of J & M.  Discovery in the case of David, et al. v. Signal, \net al., United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana (Civ. No. 08-1220 \nSM/DEK) (the “David Litigation”) has established that Wilks had full control and decision-making \nauthority over J & M such that J & M and Wilks were alter egos of one another. \n80. Wilks is the founder of J & M. He incorporated it in 1996. The main corporate office of J \n& M is Wilks’ home. J & M, during the time relevant to this litigation, was entirely beholden to \nWilks for its business activity. Further, Wilks has testified that during the time relevant to this \nlitigation all of J & M’s decisions and policy changes would have to be approved by him. He was \nthe main decision-maker with regard to all of the company’s relevant business activity. Both Wilks \nand his former lawyer describe Wilks as the only person who knows anything about the company \nand that it is indeed his company, although in fact Wilks’ sons participated in the conduct of the \ncompany. \nThird Amended Complaint    16 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 17 of 72 PageID #:  3514\n81. At some point prior to 2007, J & M was sued in unrelated litigation. In response to that \nlawsuit, Wilks set up a new corporation – J & M Marine & Industrial, LLC (“J & M Marine”) – \nprimarily to avoid the litigation then pending against J & M, but also to continue the work that was \nunderway with J & M. \n82. Wilks used the contractual arrangements and relationships he had set up between J & M \nand the Recruiter Defendants to create profitable opportunities for his new J & M Marine entity. \nIn other words, Wilks harvested the value that remained in J & M and transferred it to J & M \nMarine with no regard to the independent corporate identity of J & M. Such a transition is not \nreflective of the action of a corporate entity; rather, it indicates an action done for the convenience \nand singular strategy of the principal, Wilks. \n83. In 2007, Wilks put J & M into dormancy. This purported change of corporate status was, \nupon information and belief, done without any formal shareholder vote or board member meeting. \nFurther, J & M is undercapitalized; it has, according to Wilks, approximately $300,000 in debt. \nFurther, Wilks, in yet another indication of the absence of corporate formalities between him and \nJ & M, has represented to the Court in the David Litigation that he intends to borrow money so \nthat he is able to personally fund J & M’s legal defense. \n84. J & M filed a “Notice to Dissolve/Revoke” with the Mississippi Secretary of State on \nSeptember 12, 2010, although it remained in good standing through December 2012 according to \nthe Mississippi Secretary of State’s Business Services website. \n85. In short, there is no independence between Defendant Wilks and J & M. J & M was simply \nused as the corporate entity to facilitate Wilks’ personal business and that of his family. He testified \nduring his deposition in the David Litigation that he did everything for the company. Indeed, prior \nto incorporating J & M in 1996, Wilks was doing the exact same work, as the 100% owner, under \nThird Amended Complaint    17 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 18 of 72 PageID #:  3515\na “doing/business/as” rubric. Once Wilks incorporated J & M in 1996, there was no change to the \ncompany activity or purpose, and J & M certainly did not obtain an identity independent from its \nfounder. \n86. Once Wilks created J & M Marine, he simply shifted his employee, Nicole Homel-Tellier, \nfrom J & M over to J & M Marine. As he had done with J & M, he listed himself as the registered \nagent and his home address as the company’s principal address with the Mississippi Secretary of \nState. \n87. Both J & M and J & M Marine clearly share the same initials, which reference the same \nindividuals: John and Michael Wilks. \n88. Both corporations perform the same work: recruit laborers to then subcontract them out to \nother companies for a profit. Given both entities were in the same business and both operated out \nof the same address, it is likely that whatever assets were held by J & M (e.g., computers, printers, \netc.) were at the disposal of J & M Marine both during the time that both companies existed and \nalso once J & M was put into dormancy. \n89. More importantly, with respect to the “asset” crossover between the two companies, \nDefendant Wilks moved the laborers – plaintiffs and other similarly situated – from J&M, with \nwhich they contracted, over to J & M Marine. In other words, the very revenue source of J & M \nbecame the revenue for J & M Marine. \n90. In bringing the candidates over to J & M Marine, after they had signed contracts with J & \nM, Defendant Wilks was unequivocally holding J & M Marine out as the successor company of J \n& M. Further, this transition of recruits, in conjunction with avoiding the litigation then pending \nagainst J & M, exemplifies the taking of the benefits of the predecessor company while leaving its \nliabilities behind. Wilks acknowledges that J & M has a $100,000 judgment against it, an obvious \nThird Amended Complaint    18 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 19 of 72 PageID #:  3516\nliability that has not tracked across to J & M Marine. \n91. Throughout this Complaint, Plaintiffs refer to Defendants Indo-Ameri Soft, Rao, J & M, \nWilks and J & M Marine collectively as the “Labor Broker Defendants.” \nAll Defendants \n92. At all relevant times, Defendants Dewan, Dewan Consultants, Global Resources, Burnett, \nBurnett Law Offices and GCILC acted as agents of Defendants Signal, J & M, Indo-Ameri Soft \nand/or Rao for the purposes of recruiting, obtaining, contracting, transportation and/or providing \nPlaintiffs for labor or services. \n93. All Defendants acted together in a joint venture in committing the wrongful actions \ndescribed herein. \n94. The actions of the Recruiter Defendants and Legal Facilitator Defendants described herein \nwere performed within the scope of their agency to Signal. \n95. Individually  and  through  their  agents,  associates,  attorneys,  and/or  employees,  all \nDefendants have significant contacts in or around Orange, Texas. \n96. At all relevant times, Defendants were “persons” within that term as defined by RICO, 18 \nU.S.C. § 1961(3). \n97. Upon information and belief, Defendants have been engaged in contacts with Plaintiffs, \nincluding recruiting, obtaining, labor contracting, providing immigration related services to, \ntransporting, harboring, providing and/or employing Plaintiffs. \n98. At all relevant times, Defendants operated enterprises engaged in interstate commerce or \nin the production of goods for interstate commerce. \n \n \nThird Amended Complaint    19 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 20 of 72 PageID #:  3517\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nThe Recruitment Process \nRecruitment of the Plaintiffs and Other Workers \n99. Beginning  in  2003  and  continuing  through  2006,  Recruiter  Defendants  (Defendants \nDewan, Dewan Consultants, and Global Resources) placed ads in various newspapers across India \nand the United Arab Emirates, seeking welders, fitters, and other marine fabrication workers on \nbehalf of U.S.-based companies and individuals, including Labor Broker Defendants (Defendants \nIndo-Ameri Soft, Rao, and J & M), and Signal Defendants. \n100. Upon information and belief, Recruiter Defendants placed such ads in coordination and \nagreement with Legal Facilitator Defendants (Defendants Burnett, GCILC, and Burnett Law \nOffices), and Labor Broker Defendants. \n101. Upon information and belief, since at least December 2003 through at least mid-2004, \nLegal  Facilitator  Defendants  and  Labor  Broker  Defendants  frequently  communicated  and \nconsulted frequently via mail, fax, e-mail and/or telephone communications to coordinate and \ndirect Recruiter Defendants’ activities, including a first-round of advertising efforts on behalf of \nLabor Broker Defendants. \n102. The advertisements placed by Recruiter Defendants promised that qualified candidates \ncould  obtain  legal  permanent  residence  (green  cards)  and  thereby  legally  and  permanently \nimmigrate to the United States with their families. \n103. In  response  to  these  advertisements,  Plaintiffs  contacted  Recruiter  Defendants  by \ntelephone, and/or attended meetings and testing sessions organized by Recruiter Defendants, Legal \nFacilitator  Defendants,  and  Labor  Broker  Defendants  and  their  agents,  employees  and/or \nrepresentatives at several locations throughout India and the United Arab Emirates. \nThird Amended Complaint    20 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 21 of 72 PageID #:  3518\n104. Specific facts relevant to the experiences of Plaintiffs are set forth in the “RICO Fraud \nChart” attached to this Complaint as Exhibit 1, which is incorporated herein by reference. \n105. Upon information and belief, prior to attending these meetings and testing sessions, Labor \nBroker Defendants, Recruiter Defendants, and Legal Facilitator Defendants conferred in late 2003 \nand early 2004 by phone, mail, fax and or e-mail to organize, plan, and coordinate the logistics \nand substantive content of these meetings and testing sessions.  \n106. In telephone communications, in-person meetings, faxes, contracts, and other written \ndocuments transmitted by mail and/or wire in 2004, Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator \nDefendants, and/or Labor Broker Defendants personally and through employees, agents and/or \nassociates, told Plaintiffs that if Plaintiffs successfully passed skills tests administered in the \nUnited Arab Emirates or India and paid fees totaling approximately 5 Indian lakh rupees then \nPlaintiffs would be able to apply for permanent resident (green card) status in the United States \nwith Labor Broker Defendants. \n107. In  these  communications  occurring  during  2004,  Recruiter  Defendants  and  Legal \nFacilitator Defendants further explained to many of the Plaintiffs, as reflected in the attached \nExhibit 1, that the installment payments would be divided among Recruiter Defendants and Legal \nFacilitator Defendants. \n108. In these communications occurring during 2004, Recruiter Defendants, Labor Broker \nDefendants, and Legal Facilitator Defendants further explained to Plaintiffs that the installment \npayments would be divided among Recruiter Defendants, and one of the two Labor Broker \nDefendant entities. \n109. In telephone communications, in-person meetings, faxes, written contracts, and/or other \nwritten communications, transmitted, upon information and belief, by mail and/or wire in 2004, \nThird Amended Complaint    21 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 22 of 72 PageID #:  3519\nRecruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and Labor Broker Defendants instructed \nPlaintiffs that the total fees would be paid in a series of approximately three installments. \n110. In these conversations in 2004, Recruiter Defendants and/or Legal Facilitator Defendants \ncommunicated to Plaintiffs that Plaintiffs would be able to obtain legal permanent residence for \ntheir spouses and children for an additional fee.  \n111. At informational meetings and in telephone conversations, faxes, contracts, and other \nwritten documents transmitted in late 2003 through 2004, Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator \nDefendants, and Labor Broker Defendants, personally and/or through their agents, representatives, \nand/or  employees,  represented  to  Plaintiffs  that  Labor  Broker  Defendants  were  stable  and \nreputable U.S. companies offering lawful and ample employment opportunities, and that Labor \nBroker Defendants would obtain for Plaintiffs green cards enabling Plaintiffs to permanently and \nlegally immigrate to the United States with their family members. \n112. At informational meetings and in telephone conversations, faxes, contracts, and other \nwritten  documents  transmitted  in  late  2003  through  2004,  the  Recruiter  Defendants,  Legal \nFacilitator Defendants, and Labor Broker Defendants, personally and/or through their agents, \nemployees and/or representatives, told Plaintiffs that the green card process, once commenced, \nwould be completed within18 to 24 months. \n113. In  such  communications  with  Plaintiffs,  Recruiter  Defendants,  Legal  Facilitator \nDefendants, and Labor Broker Defendants further promised to act diligently and do everything \nnecessary to obtain green cards for Plaintiffs in the timelines stipulated. \n114. Based on these and other contractually-binding promises made to them regarding green \ncards and work opportunities in the United States, Plaintiffs entered into contracts (hereinafter “the \ngreen card contracts”) at various times in 2004 with Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator \nThird Amended Complaint    22 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 23 of 72 PageID #:  3520\nDefendants, and Labor Broker Defendants. \n115. Upon information and belief, contracts signed by Plaintiffs and other documents provided \nto  the  Plaintiffs  by  Legal  Facilitator  Defendants,  Recruiter  Defendants,  and  Labor  Broker \nDefendants through the use of mail and/or wire transmissions in 2004, further promised that \nPlaintiffs would promptly receive a refund of all or nearly all of their payments if these Defendants \ndid not succeed in securing green cards for Plaintiffs as promised. \n116. Legal Facilitator Defendants, Recruiter Defendants, and Labor Broker Defendants knew \nor should have known that they would not refund Plaintiffs’ money as promised in the contracts \nand other documents. \n117. Legal  Facilitator  Defendants,  Recruiter  Defendants  and  Labor  Broker  Defendants \ninduced the Plaintiffs to enter into the green card contracts: (a) without intent to diligently pursue \nPlaintiffs’  green  card  applications;  and  (b)  knowingly  without  any  basis  whatsoever  for \nrepresenting, inter alia: (i) that the companies and/or entities purportedly sponsoring Plaintiffs’ \napplications were financially solvent and had reliable and stable employment opportunities to \nprovide Plaintiffs; (ii) that green card applications sponsored by such companies would be valid \nand bona fide under U.S. immigration law; (iii) and that such applications were likely to be \nsuccessfully completed and approved within the promised timelines. \n118. In reasonable reliance on Legal Facilitator Defendants, Recruiter Defendants and Labor \nBroker Defendants’ explicit and repeated promises regarding green cards, family members’ ability \nto immigrate to the United States, and lawful and legitimate employment opportunities in the \nUnited States, Plaintiffs undertook considerable economic, social, familial and personal sacrifices, \nincluding payment of high fees, assumption of significant interest bearing debt, loss of real and \npersonal property, lost work opportunities, lost or unpaid wages and additional legal fees. \nThird Amended Complaint    23 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 24 of 72 PageID #:  3521\n119. Plaintiffs  signed  contracts  with  Recruiter  Defendants,  Legal  Facilitator  Defendants, \nand/or Labor Broker Defendants and made the first round of installment payments required by \nthese contracts. \n120. After Plaintiffs signed contracts with Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, \nand/or Labor Broker Defendants and paid the first installment payments required by the contracts, \nthese Defendants failed to provide Plaintiffs with updates regarding the progress of their green \ncard applications for extended periods of time. \n121. When Plaintiffs contacted Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and/or \nLabor Broker Defendants by phone, mail, and/or e-mail at various times between the last half of \n2004 and mid-2006 to check on the progress of their green card applications, these Defendants \nassured them that the green card process was going forward. \n122. While awaiting the processing of their green cards, many of these Plaintiffs continued to \nincur substantial interest on the money they had borrowed for the purpose of making the first \ninstallment payment to these Defendants. \n123. In or around January 2006, Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants and Labor \nBroker Defendants, personally and/or through their agents, employees and/or representatives \nnotified Plaintiffs via telephone, e-mail, and/or mail communications that the labor certification \nrequired for their green card applications had been approved by the U.S. government. \n124. After this notification, Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants and Labor \nBroker Defendants used wire and/or mail communications to collect the second and/or third \ninstallment payments from the Plaintiffs. \n125. By spring 2006, after the 18 to 24 month processing period promised by Recruiter \nDefendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and Labor Broker Defendants had elapsed, the Plaintiffs \nThird Amended Complaint    24 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 25 of 72 PageID #:  3522\nhad still not received their green cards. \n126. By spring of 2006, Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and Labor Broker \nDefendants had yet to refund Plaintiffs’ payments as promised by Plaintiffs’ green card contracts. \n127. Upon  information  and  belief,  in  the  course  of  telephone,  fax,  e-mail  and/or  mail \ncommunications occurring in or around April or May 2006, Defendant Signal authorized Recruiter \nDefendants to act as their agents in India and the United Arab Emirates for the purposes of \nrecruiting Indian welders and fitters to fill the anticipated H- 2B guestworker jobs at Signal \noperations. \n128. Upon information and belief, in the course of these communications, Defendant Signal \nfurther authorized Recruiter Defendants and Legal Facilitator Defendants to represent that Signal \nwould assume sponsorship of the pending and as-yet-unsuccessful green card applications on \nbehalf of, among others, Plaintiffs. \n129. In  addition,  beginning  in  2006,  Recruiter  Defendants  (Defendants  Dewan,  Dewan \nConsultants, and Global Resources) placed ads in various newspapers across India and the United \nArab Emirates, seeking welders, fitters, and other marine fabrication workers on behalf of Signal.  \n130. Recruiter Defendants’ advertisements and other recruiting efforts were undertaken on \nbehalf of, at the direction of, and/or in coordination and consultation with Defendant Signal and \nthe Legal Facilitator Defendants. \n131. In response to the advertisements posted by Recruiter Defendants, Plaintiffs contacted \nRecruiter Defendants in spring, summer and fall 2006 via telephone and in-person meetings.    \n132. At the same time, Plaintiffs who had already initiated the green card process and made \npayments to the Labor Broker Defendants were told by Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator \nDefendants, and/or Labor Broker Defendants that Signal would sponsor their visas to the United \nThird Amended Complaint    25 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 26 of 72 PageID #:  3523\nStates for an additional sum and they could quickly obtain H-2B visas to go to the United States \nfor work at Defendant Signal’s operations and their green cards would be processed while they \nworked at Signal.   \n133. Plaintiffs, unaware of U.S. immigration law and the temporary, nonimmigrant character \nof H-2B visas and desperate not to forfeit the substantial fees that they had already paid, agreed, \nin reliance on the representations of Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and/or \nLabor  Broker  Defendants,  to  transfer  their  green  card  applications  to  Defendant  Signal’s \nsponsorship and further agreed to work for Defendant Signal under H-2B visas pursuant to the \nterms explained by Recruiter Defendants. \n134. In late May and early June of 2006, the Legal Facilitator Defendants, on behalf of \nDefendant Signal filed with the Mississippi Department of Employment Security, the Texas \nWorkforce  Commission,  and  the  United  States  Department  of  Labor  by  mail,  electronic \ntransmission, and/or fax the completed forms ETA 750 and attachments seeking permission to \nimport and hire 590 foreign guestworkers under the auspices of 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b), \nattendant regulations 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(6) and 20 C.F.R. § 655.3, and associated administrative \nletters and/or guidance (commonly known as “the H-2B guestworker program”). \n135. Knowing that Signal’s labor need was projected to be at least two to three years, the Legal \nFacilitator Defendants and Defendant Signal stated in these applications to the state workforce \ncommissions and in forms ETA 750 that Signal would employ workers from October 1, 2006 to \nJuly 31, 2007. These applications were furnished with signatures by Signal executives swearing, \nunder penalty of perjury, to the veracity of the information in these applications. \n136. Defendant Signal sought these workers to perform various jobs essential to its marine \nfabrication services business, including welding and fitting, in Orange, Texas and Pascagoula, \nThird Amended Complaint    26 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 27 of 72 PageID #:  3524\nMississippi. \n137. On information and belief, Defendant Signal, despite knowing the specific type of work \nto be performed by the H-2B guestworkers, misclassified the jobs as production occupations where \nthose jobs should be classified under the construction trades occupation based on the work actually \nto be performed by the H-2B guestworkers.  \n138. On information and belief, Defendant Signal recruited these workers, including the \nPlaintiffs, and offered terms of employment to these workers from its operations in Orange, Texas \nand Pascagoula, Mississippi. \n139. The H-2B guestworker program permits U.S. employers to import foreign workers on \nshort-term temporary visas to meet labor needs in specified job trades when employers attest that \nthey cannot find U.S. workers to perform the available jobs in the local area where the employer \nseeks to employ the guestworker. \n140. H-2B visas are non-immigrant visas, are only valid for work with the specific employer \nlisted on the visa, and do not provide portable and/or transferable employment authorization for \nthe visa bearer. \n141. H-2B visas require employers to pay H-2B guestworkers a minimum wage, which is \ndetermined by, among other things, the location where the guestworker will work, the type of work \ndone by the guestworker, and the experience or skill level of the guestworker. \n142. Defendant Signal stated in the ETA 750 forms that its need for H-2B guestworkers was \n“peak load and a one-time occurrence” and that “the temporary workers will work for the length \nof the prescribed dates of need, will be paid in accordance with the prevailing wage, and will return \nto their home country at the end of employment.” \n143. In the ETA 750 forms, Defendant Signal named Legal Facilitator Defendants as its agents \nThird Amended Complaint    27 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 28 of 72 PageID #:  3525\nfor the purposes of preparing and submitting these applications to import H-2B guestworkers. \nLegal Facilitator Defendants prepared and submitted these applications on behalf of Signal. \n144. At the time of filing the ETA 750 forms and attachments with the Mississippi Department \nof Employment Security, the Texas Workforce Commission, and the United States Department of \nLabor, Defendant Signal and the Legal Facilitator Defendants knew that Signal projected the labor \nneed that it sought to fill with foreign workers to be at least two to three years. \n145. Defendant Signal and Legal Facilitator Defendants, at or around the time they filed the \nETA 750 forms in May and June 2006, repeatedly communicated by telephone, mail, e-mail, \nand/or fax to direct and coordinate recruitment of Indian workers to fill the anticipated H-2B \nguestworker  jobs.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Signal  and/or  Legal  Facilitator  Defendants \nrepeatedly communicated with Recruiter Defendants and Labor Broker Defendants by telephone, \nmail, e-mail, and/or fax to direct and coordinate recruitment of Indian workers to fill the anticipated \nH-2B guestworker jobs. \n146. Upon information and belief, in the course of these communications, Defendant Signal \nfurther authorized Recruiter Defendants and Legal Facilitator Defendants to represent that Signal \nwould apply for at least two to three H-2B visa extensions on behalf of all the Indian H-2B workers, \nincluding Plaintiffs, to allow them to remain in the United States working for Signal while \nPlaintiffs’ green card applications were being processed. \n147. Defendant Signal authorized its agents to make these representations even though it knew \nor had reason to know that such visa extensions and green card applications would not be bona \nfide and valid under United States immigration law. Moreover, Defendant Signal authorized its \nagents to make these misrepresentations even though it did not have the intention at that time to \napply for such visa extensions and/or green cards on behalf of all of the Indian H-2B workers, \nThird Amended Complaint    28 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 29 of 72 PageID #:  3526\nincluding Plaintiffs. \n148. In July and August of 2006, with specific dates and assertions as set out in Ex. 1, the \nLegal Facilitator Defendants on behalf of Defendant Signal filed with the United States Citizenship \nand Immigration Service by mail, electronic transmission, and/or fax the completed I-129 forms \nand attachments seeking 590 H-2B visas. \n149. Knowing that Signal’s labor need was projected to be at least two to three years, in these \nH-2B visa applications Defendant Signal attested to a 10-month labor need running from October \n1, 2006 – July 31, 2007. Signal falsely represented to the government that at the end of this 10 \nmonth  period,  it  intended  to  return  all  H-2B  workers  back  to  India.  The  Legal  Facilitator \nDefendants declared that the applications were based on all information of which Defendant \nBurnett had any knowledge despite the fact that the Legal Facilitator Defendants believed that \nSignal’s intentions for these workers exceeded ten months. \n150. Upon information and belief, Defendant Signal authorized Recruiter Defendants and \nLegal Facilitator Defendants to act as their agents for the purposes of recruiting and providing \nIndian welders and fitters to fill anticipated H-2B guestworker jobs at Signal operations. \n151. Defendant Signal, Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and/or Labor \nBroker Defendants falsely assured Plaintiffs that Defendant Signal would seek at least two \nextensions of the temporary H-2B visas with which Plaintiffs would gain admittance to the United \nStates, and that Plaintiffs’ H-2B visas would thereafter be converted to permanent green cards. \n152. Upon information and belief, prior to these communications with Plaintiffs, Recruiter \nDefendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and Defendant Signal communicated and consulted \nfrequently via mail, fax, e-mail and/or telephone communications regarding the issues to be \ndiscussed and representations to be made to Plaintiffs. \nThird Amended Complaint    29 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 30 of 72 PageID #:  3527\n153. In their communications with Plaintiffs, Defendant Signal, Recruiter Defendants, Legal \nFacilitator Defendants, and/or Labor Broker Defendants further failed to disclose material facts \nregarding the H-2B visa, including the fact that H-2B visas confer only a temporary non-immigrant \nstatus which does not allow the bearer to adjust to permanent residency status and the fact that \napplying for H-2B visa status is fundamentally incompatible with simultaneously applying for a \ngreen card. \n154. In reliance on the representations of Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, \nLabor Broker Defendants and Defendant Signal, Plaintiffs and others similarly situated entered the \nUnited States on H-2B guestworker visas in late 2006 and early 2007 for the purposes of working \nfor Defendant Signal at its Orange, Texas facility or Pascagoula, Mississippi facility. \n155. On or about July 20, 2006 and August 17, 2006, the United States Department of Labor \napproved Signal’s labor certification applications for 590 H-2B workers for the period of October \n1, 2006 through July 31, 2007. \n156. In approving these labor certification applications, the United States Department of Labor \nrelied on the accuracy of the applications’ stated 10-month period of labor need. \n157. On information and belief, the Department of Labor is prohibited by its internal guidelines \nto grant labor certification applications without relying on the application’s statement of temporary \nlabor need. \n158. In late August and early September 2006, the United States Citizenship and Immigration \nService approved Signal’s H-2B visa petitions for 590 H-2B workers for the period of October 1, \n2006 through July 31, 2007. \n159. In approving these visa petitions, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service \nrelied on the accuracy of the petitions’ stated 10-month period of labor need and the representation \nThird Amended Complaint    30 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 31 of 72 PageID #:  3528\nthat Defendant Signal’s need was based on a one time peak-load temporary demand for the work \nlisted in the applications. \n160. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Service must, according to regulation, \nrely on the stated period of the petitioner’s labor need, see 8 C.F.R.214.2(h)(6)(ii)(B) (2006). \n161. Defendant Signal, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and Recruiter Defendants knew that the \nstated period of need in Signal’s applications for labor certifications and for H-2B visas were \ninconsistent with Signal’s projected actual labor need and therefore Defendants knew these \nstatements to the government were false. \n162. The Recruiter Defendants and the Legal Facilitator Defendants used the H-2B visas, \nobtained from the U.S. Government on the basis of false statements by Defendant Signal and the \nLegal Facilitator Defendants, to elicit multiple installment payments Plaintiffs. \n163. Plaintiffs would not have paid the extraordinary fees charged by Recruiter Defendants, \nLegal Facilitator Defendants, and/or Labor Broker Defendants for travel, green cards, visas, and \nwork opportunities had they known that these Defendants’ promises and representations were \nfalse. \n164. Plaintiffs would not have paid the extraordinary fees charged by the Recruiter Defendants, \nLegal Facilitator Defendants, and/or Labor Brokers Defendants for travel, green cards, visas, and \nemployment opportunities had they known that these Defendants had failed to disclose material \nfacts concerning the nature and terms and conditions of the immigration and work opportunities \noffered. \n165. Had Plaintiffs not paid the extraordinary fees, Defendant Signal would have had to pay \nthe recruitment, travel, green card, visa and other costs necessary to recruit and employ the H-2B \nguestworkers or other workers to fill the positions. \nThird Amended Complaint    31 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 32 of 72 PageID #:  3529\nPreparations and Departure for Signal Operations in the United States \n166. At various times from the spring of 2006 to early 2007, employees of Defendant Signal \ntraveled to various locations in India and the United Arab Emirates and tested Plaintiffs’ welding \nand pipefitting skills in anticipation of employing them in the United States. \n167. Plaintiffs paid costs necessary to travel to the cities where these tests were held. \n168. Plaintiffs paid admission fees charged to take these tests. \n169. Plaintiffs attended and passed these tests, which were overseen and graded by Defendant \nSignal’s and/or Defendant Dewan’s agents, employees, and/or representatives. \n170. Upon information and belief, prior to attending these meetings and testing sessions, \nDefendant Signal, Recruiter Defendants, and Legal Facilitator Defendants conferred in spring, \nsummer, and fall 2006 by phone, mail, fax and or e-mail to organize, plan, and coordinate the \nlogistics and substantive content of these testing sessions. \n171. Plaintiffs entered the United States on H-2B guestworker visas, issued by the U.S. \nGovernment on the basis of false statements by Defendant Signal and the Legal Facilitator \nDefendants, in late 2006 and early 2007 for the purposes of working for Defendant Signal at its \nOrange, Texas or Pascagoula, Mississippi facility. \n172. Around the time of USCIS’s visa approval, Plaintiffs made necessary preparations in \norder to travel to the United States on H-2B visas to work for Signal, including: paying to obtain \nnecessary travel and legal documents, making payments to the United States consulate, Recruiter \nDefendants and Legal Facilitator Defendants for mandatory H-2B visa and consular processing \nfees, attending H-2B visa interviews, and paying Recruiter Defendants for travel arrangements. \n173. In  order  to  secure  H-2B  visas  to  work  for  Signal,  Plaintiffs  were  required  to  be \ninterviewed by United States Consular offices in Indian cities. \nThird Amended Complaint    32 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 33 of 72 PageID #:  3530\n174. These consular interviews necessitated that Plaintiffs pay the costs of travel from their \nhomes and/or current places of employment to various large Indian cities including Chennai \n(Madras), Delhi and Mumbai (Bombay). \n175. Recruiter Defendants and/or Legal Facilitator Defendants, acting as Defendant Signal’s \nagents, required that  Plaintiffs  meet  with  Recruiter  Defendants  and/or  the  Legal  Facilitator \nDefendants in these Indian cities prior to attending their consular interviews. \n176. Upon information and belief, prior to these meetings Recruiter Defendants and Legal \nFacilitator Defendants discussed amongst themselves and with Defendant Signal by e-mail, \ntelephone, or in-person communications the topics to be discussed and instructions to be given to \nPlaintiffs and others similarly situated at these meetings. \n177. At these pre-interview meetings, Recruiter Defendants and Legal Facilitator Defendants \nensured that Plaintiffs were up-to-date on paying the fee installments required by their green card \ncontracts. \n178. Defendants further required that Plaintiffs pay an additional 35,000 to 45,000 rupees \n($800 to $1,100) fee for H-2B visa processing. \n179. On information and belief, Recruiter Defendants and/or Legal Facilitator Defendants \nrequired Plaintiffs to sign documents permitting Defendant Sachin Dewan to receive their visa \nstamped passports from the Consulate on Plaintiffs’ behalves. \n180. Recruiter Defendants and/or Legal Facilitator Defendants also coached the Plaintiffs on \nwhat to say and what not to say during consular interviews. Those Defendants, inter alia, told \nPlaintiffs not to say anything about the substantial fees Plaintiffs had been required to pay, not to \nsay anything about expected green cards, and, if asked, to say that Plaintiffs expected to be in the \nUnited States for only several months and then would return to India. \nThird Amended Complaint    33 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 34 of 72 PageID #:  3531\n181. Recruiter Defendants and/or Legal Facilitator Defendants told Plaintiffs that if they did \nnot follow these instructions regarding the interviews, Plaintiffs would not receive their visas and \nwould forfeit the all moneys they had previously paid to Defendants, in addition to losing their \nopportunity to permanently immigrate to the United States. \n182. During Plaintiffs’ consular interviews, the consular officials took Plaintiffs’ passports \nfrom them. \n183. Once Plaintiffs’ visas were approved, consular officials sent their passports, with H-2B \nvisas affixed, directly to Defendant Dewan. \n184. After receiving word that Plaintiffs’ visas were approved, Recruiter Defendants made \ntravel arrangements for Plaintiffs’ departures to the United States. \n185. Before Plaintiffs could leave for the United States, however, Plaintiffs were required to \nattend final meetings in Recruiter Defendants’ Mumbai (Bombay) office. \n186. Such meetings typically took place mere hours before Plaintiffs’ scheduled departures to \nthe United States, when Recruiter Defendants’ office with large numbers of fellow Indian workers \nawaiting departure to the United States. \n187. At these meetings, Recruiter Defendants collected final installment payments required by \nPlaintiffs’ green card contracts. \n188. Recruiter Defendants also required that Plaintiffs, most of whom do not proficiently read \nor speak English, sign English language documents with little or no time for review. \n189. Recruiter  Defendants  refused  to  return  Plaintiffs’  passports  --  which  had  been  in \nDefendant Sachin Dewan’s possession  since after  Plaintiffs’ H-2B visas were  approved by \nConsular Officials -- until after Plaintiffs had paid the final installments and signed the mandatory \npaperwork. \nThird Amended Complaint    34 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 35 of 72 PageID #:  3532\n190. In forceful tones, Recruiter Defendants or their staff demanded that Plaintiffs quickly sign \nthe  mandatory  documents,  lest  they  miss  the  flights  to  the  United  States  which  Recruiter \nDefendants had scheduled for them. \n191. Without possession of their passports and within this rushed and hostile atmosphere, \nPlaintiffs had no reasonable opportunity to review, negotiate, and/or make any changes to the \ndocuments presented them. \n192. On  occasions  when  workers  who  appeared  at  the  Mumbai  office  failed  to  present \nsufficient funds to pay the final installment required by the green card contracts, Defendant Dewan \nand his associates threatened to destroy and/or deface these workers’ passports. \n193. Such threats were uttered in the presence of other workers, causing these workers to \nreasonably believe that they had no choice but to pay the final installments in full. \n194. Based on the Recruiter Defendants’ threatening and coercive behavior during these pre-\ndeparture meetings in Mumbai and the extraordinary and increasing levels of debt they had \nincurred to pay the Recruiter Defendants and Legal Facilitator Defendants for green card and H-\n2B visa arrangements, Plaintiffs reasonably believed that they had no choice but to make the \npayments required by the Recruiter Defendants and to travel to the United States to work for \nDefendant Signal. \n195. Plaintiffs and approximately 590 other Indian H-2B workers traveled from Mumbai to \nDefendant Signal’s operations in the U.S. at various times from late October 2006 to July 2007 on \ntickets arranged by the Recruiter Defendants. \n196. Pursuant  to  Defendant  Signal’s  instructions  and  arrangements,  approximately  300 \nworkers, including one of these Plaintiffs, were sent to Signal’s Pascagoula, Mississippi facility, \nand approximately 290 workers, including these Plaintiffs, were sent to Signal’s Orange, Texas \nThird Amended Complaint    35 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 36 of 72 PageID #:  3533\nfacility upon arrival in the United States, although Signal’s Orange, Texas facility began turning \naway workers in or around February 2007. \n197. The Plaintiffs had no choice but to use the Recruiter Defendants and the Legal Facilitator \nDefendants to secure employment at Defendant Signal’s operations. \n198. The Plaintiffs had no choice but to pay the fees the Recruiter Defendants and the Legal \nFacilitator Defendants charged to secure employment at Defendant Signal’s operations. \n199. Management personnel at Defendant Signal made the conscious and deliberate decision \nto prohibit the Plaintiffs from securing employment at Signal’s operations either through another \nrecruiter or by bypassing recruiters’ altogether and applying directly with Defendant Signal. \n200. Furthermore, Defendant Signal recruited Plaintiffs Kang, Arunachalam, Ruthirapathi, \nMaideen,  Sequira,  Pillai,  Kunjupanickan,  Robi,  and  Chinnian    (collectively,  “Abandoned \nPlaintiffs”) and did not fulfill its promise to employ them.  On information and belief, Signal \ncontinued to recruit Abandoned Plaintiffs knowing that it did not intend to employ Abandoned \nPlaintiffs.   On information and belief, Signal knew the Abandoned Plaintiffs had incurred \nsubstantial debt, given up stable jobs, and travelled half-way across the world.  On information \nand belief, Signal knew or should have known that the Abandoned Plaintiffs arrived at airports in \nthe United States expecting to be picked up by Signal representatives and Signal did not pick them \nor notify them that no one was coming to pick them up.  Signal’s refusal to employ the Abandoned \nPlaintiffs was in direct contrast to promises Signal made to the US government in its petition for \nH-2B visas, and to promises Signal made to the Abandoned Plaintiffs themselves during the \nrecruitment process, and, furthermore, was done because Plaintiffs were Indian nationals.  \nConditions at Signal Facilities in Orange and Pascagoula \n201. Upon arrival at Defendant Signal’s facilities in Orange and Pascagoula, Plaintiffs were \nThird Amended Complaint    36 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 37 of 72 PageID #:  3534\nshocked  to  discover  that  they  were  expected  to  live  in  isolated,  overcrowded  labor  camps \ncomprised of trailer-like bunkhouses.  \n202. Defendant Signal’s labor camps were located in isolated, industrial areas miles removed \nfrom shopping areas, places of worship, and residential communities. The camps were enclosed \nby fences and accessible only by a single guarded entrance. \n203. The Signal labor camp gates at the Texas and Mississippi facilities were constantly \nmonitored by security guards retained by Defendant Signal. \n204. Signal’s security guards monitored Plaintiffs’ comings and goings by requiring them to \nshow their employee identification badges and recording when Plaintiffs entered and exited the \ncamps. Signal’s security guards also searched Plaintiffs’ packages and bags when they entered the \ncamp. \n205. Except on rare occasions, Plaintiffs were not permitted to receive visitors in the Signal \nlabor camps. \n206. Up to twenty-four Indian men were housed in each bunkhouse and made to sleep in two-\ntiered bunk beds. The bunk beds were so tightly packed in the bunkhouses that it was difficult for \nworkers to move about in the narrow passageways between bunks. These housing conditions, inter \nalia, violated the applicable health and safety standards under the federal Occupational Health and \nSafety Act. \n207. The Signal labor camp bunkhouses had insufficient toileting and bathing facilities for \ntwenty-four men, resulting in long lines for the bathrooms before and after work shifts. \n208. Privacy was non-existent, and Plaintiffs often experienced extreme difficulty sleeping due \nto the constant noise resulting from the close quarters and the comings and goings of workers who \nworked on different shifts. \nThird Amended Complaint    37 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 38 of 72 PageID #:  3535\n209. Defendant Signal’s personnel and/or security guards conducted surprise searches of the \ndormitory areas of the bunkhouses, including searches of workers’ personal belongings. \n210. Plaintiffs took their meals in Defendant Signal’s mess halls, which were only open during \nlimited hours. Due to filthy and unhygienic kitchen conditions and food preparation methods, \nPlaintiffs frequently became ill. \n211. Upon information and belief, Defendant Signal did not obtain the required permit(s) to \nfurnish the board at its Texas Labor Camp, and the condition and sanitation of the board further \nviolated  federal,  state,  and/or  local  law  including,  inter  alia,  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug \nAdministration Code, as adopted and modified by Texas Food Establishment Rules.  In addition, \nthe Mississippi Labor Camp violated Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) \nguidelines on habitability. \n212. Defendant Signal deducted labor camp fees of approximately $35 per day ($245 per week, \nor  approximately  $1,050  per  month)  from  Plaintiffs’  paychecks  for  these  substandard \naccommodations and meals. \n213. When Plaintiffs complained and asked to live outside the labor camps, Defendant Signal \ninitially refused and subsequently told workers that if they tried to live outside the camps Signal \nwould still deduct the labor camp fees from Plaintiffs’ wages. As a result, Plaintiffs reasonably felt \nthat they had no choice but to continue living in the Signal camps. \n214. Defendant Signal only housed Indian H-2B workers such as Plaintiffs in its labor camps, \nwhich employees and management at Signal referred to as the “reservation(s),” in a derogatory \nplay on the common name (“Indian”) for Plaintiffs’ ethnicity and Native Americans. Upon \ninformation and belief, workers of non-Indian descent and United States citizen employees were \nneither required nor allowed to live in and/or pay for accommodations in Defendant Signal’s labor \nThird Amended Complaint    38 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 39 of 72 PageID #:  3536\ncamps. \n215. Defendant Signal subjected Plaintiffs to skills testing and re-testing, on the- job discipline, \nlayoffs, periods without work, lack of safety precautions, unfavorable job assignments, evaluation \nprocesses, and other adverse employment actions to which non-Indian and U.S. citizen workers \nwere not similarly subjected. \n216. In addition, Signal camp personnel and supervisors frequently subject Plaintiffs to an \nobjectively hostile and abusive environment. They often used offensive language in speaking with \nand/or referring to Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers and regularly insulted Plaintiffs and \nother Indian H-2B workers on the basis of their race, national origin, and/or alienage. \n217. During the first week of employing Plaintiffs and others similarly situated in the United \nStates, Defendant Signal did not reimburse Plaintiffs and others similarly situated for any of the \nexpenses that Plaintiffs and others similarly situated were required to incur as a pre-condition of \nseeking employment with Signal. \n218. During the first two weeks of employing Plaintiffs and others similarly situated in the \nUnited States, Defendant Signal deducted approximately $100 to $200 each week from Plaintiffs’ \nand other similarly situated workers’ checks for job-related tool kits which they were required to \npurchase from Defendant Signal. \n219. Prior to and during the course of their employment at Defendant Signal, Plaintiffs and \nothers similarly situated were not informed of the wage which they were legally required to be \npaid as H-2B guestworkers, nor were they informed of their job classification. \n220. During the course of their employment at Defendant Signal, Plaintiffs were not paid the \nwages required by the H-2B visa program.  \n221. Over the course of their employment at Defendant Signal, Plaintiffs and others similarly \nThird Amended Complaint    39 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 40 of 72 PageID #:  3537\nsituated were routinely awarded a fifty cent per hour “safety bonus” for workweeks when they \nwere not written up for violations of Defendant Signal’s safety rules. \n222. The safety bonus Defendant Signal paid the Plaintiffs and others similarly situated was in \naddition to their regular hourly wage. \n223. Upon information and belief, the safety bonus was non-discretionary with respect both to \nthe decision to pay the bonus and to the amount of the bonus. \n224. Defendant Signal paid the safety bonus to the Plaintiffs and others similarly situated \npursuant to a prior agreement or promise causing the Plaintiffs and others similarly situated to \nexpect the bonus payments regularly if they met the required safety criteria. \n225. During workweeks when the Plaintiffs and others similarly situated worked more than 40 \nhours, Defendant Signal did not pay one and one-half times the amount of the safety bonus for all \novertime hours worked. \n226. Signal personnel and management regularly threatened Plaintiffs and other H-2B workers \nthat  if  they  did  not  continue  working  for  Signal,  or  did  not  work  according  to  Signal’s \nspecifications, Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers would be deported back to India. \n227. In the isolated and guarded atmosphere of the labor camp and grappling with the crushing \ndebts they had incurred to come to the United States, Plaintiffs reasonably felt that Signal’s \nstatements were threatening and felt forced to continue working for Signal despite terrible working \nand living conditions. \n228. At regular meetings and in one-on-one or small group conversations with Signal camp \npersonnel and management, some workers, including some of the Plaintiffs, voiced complaints \nregarding the discriminatory treatment to which Indian H-2B workers were subject. Other similarly \nsituated workers also voiced complaints, in both the Orange and Pascagoula camps. \nThird Amended Complaint    40 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 41 of 72 PageID #:  3538\n229. Workers Vijayan and Kadakkarappally, two of the plaintiffs in the David Litigation, took \nleading roles in gathering and voicing others’ complaints to Defendant Signal’s personnel in camp \nmeetings in Pascagoula. \n230. When  Indian  workers,  including  Vijayan  and  Kadakkarappally,  voiced  grievances \nregarding  housing,  food,  and  wages,  Defendant  Signal’s  personnel  warned  them  to  stop \ncomplaining. \n231. When Signal took no action in response to workers’ complaints, numerous Indian H-2B \nworkers living at the Pascagoula labor camp, including Vijayan and Kadakkarappally, began \nmeeting collectively to discuss how to persuade Signal to improve conditions in its labor camps, \nand also began meeting with third parties to discuss how best to address their concerns. \n232. Defendant Signal became aware of these meetings, including meetings between workers, \nincluding Vijayan and Kadakkarappally, and third parties whom Signal believed to be attorneys. \n233. Defendant  Signal,  through  its  employees  and/or  agents,  contacted  the  Recruiter \nDefendants and Legal Facilitator Defendants to express its concerns about worker organizing \nefforts and the specific involvement of Vijayan and Kadakkarappally. \n234. Upon information and belief, during these conversations Recruiter Defendants, Legal \nFacilitator Defendants, and Signal reached an agreement regarding steps that they would take to \ndiscourage further worker organizing efforts and to ensure that the majority of the Indian H-2B \nworkforce continued to work at Signal without complaint, as well as to prevent the Indian H-2B \nworkforce from exercising their legal rights. \n235. Upon information and belief, Signal management and camp personnel conferred and \nplanned internally and with the private Swetman security firm in Mississippi to respond to \nworkers’ organizing activities and to take actions to ensure that the majority of the Indian H-2B \nThird Amended Complaint    41 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 42 of 72 PageID #:  3539\nworkforce continued to work at Signal without complaint, as well as to prevent the Indian H-2B \nworkforce from exercising their legal rights. \n236. On or about March 7, 2007, Defendant Sachin Dewan called Vijayan’s wife at her home \nin India and warned her that Vijayan must stop making trouble at Signal. \n237. Vijayan’s wife informed Vijayan of this call, and Vijayan called Defendant Dewan on or \nabout March 8, 2007. During that conversation, Defendant Dewan told Vijayan that Dewan had \nlearned from Defendant Signal that Vijayan was organizing the workers and making trouble. \nDefendant Dewan told Vijayan that if the organizing continued, all the workers would be sent back \nto India. \n238. Vijayan informed other Indian workers about the calls he and his wife had received from \nDefendant Dewan, and word spread quickly through the Pascagoula and Orange camps and to \nthese Plaintiffs, regarding the threats against Vijayan. \n239. News  about  the  calls  between  Defendant  Dewan,  Vijayan  and  Vijayan’s  wife \nsubstantially  heightened  the  reasonable  fears  of  Plaintiffs  in  the  Orange  camp  that  if  they \ncomplained  about  or  tried  to  leave  the  discriminatory  and  substandard  working  and  living \nconditions at Signal, the Recruiter Defendants, Legal Facilitator Defendants, and Signal would \nretaliate against Plaintiffs or their families with acts of violence or by arranging for Plaintiffs’ \ndeportation to India. \n240. Defendant Signal called a workforce-wide meeting on or about March 8, 2007 in the \nPascagoula camp, attended by Signal management and Defendant Burnett. \n241. At this meeting, Signal management told the Pascagoula workers that Signal would fight \nback against organizing efforts by the workers. \n242. Signal management further threatened that Signal would not extend Plaintiffs’ and all \nThird Amended Complaint    42 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 43 of 72 PageID #:  3540\nother Indian H-2B workers’ visas if any of the workers took legal action against Signal. At that \nsame meeting Defendant Burnett told the workers that they were ineligible for other kinds of \nimmigration relief and could depend only on Signal to maintain their H-2B immigration status and \npursue their green card applications. These threats were promptly reported to the workers in \nOrange, including Plaintiffs. \n243. At or about the same time as this camp-wide meeting in Pascagoula, Mississippi, Signal \nmanagement made the decision to terminate and forcibly deport Vijayan and Kadakkarappally, \nalong with Kuldeep Singh, Kumar, and Chellappan, three Pascagoula workers who are also \nplaintiffs in the David Litigation, and to do so by means that would make an example of them for \nthe other Indian workers in Pascagoula and in Orange, in order to keep those workers in line. \n244. Early on the morning of March 9, 2007, Signal locked the gate to its Pascagoula labor \ncamp, thereby obstructing the sole means of direct entry to and exit from the camp. \n245. Around this same time, Signal camp coordinator Darrell Snyder, and approximately five \nsecurity guards, some or all of whom were obtained through the private Swetman Security firm, \nswept through the bunkhouses carrying pictures of Vijayan, Kadakkarappally, K. Singh, Kumar, \nand Chellappan. \n246. Security guards began accosting workers to determine whether they were the individuals \nshown in the pictures. \n247. Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers at both camps became increasingly frightened \nand confused by these activities, particularly when word spread that Signal had locked the gate \nthat served as the sole exit from the Pascagoula labor camp. \n248. Around 5:15 AM that morning, Vijayan was walking towards the dining area. A security \nguard and Darrell Snyder, a Signal employee, aggressively confronted Vijayan and instructed him \nThird Amended Complaint    43 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 44 of 72 PageID #:  3541\nthat he was in their custody. \n249. Based on the threats made at the meeting on March 8, 2007 and Vijayan’s recent phone \ncall with Sachin Dewan, Vijayan feared what Defendant Signal might do to him. \n250. Vijayan began to panic, thinking of the enormous quantity of money he had spent to come \nto the United States and the massive debts he owed in India. Vijayan knew that he would not be \nable to repay such debts if he were deported and no longer employed by Signal. \n251. These feelings, combined with Vijayan’s reasonable fear that Snyder and the security \nguards might physically hurt him, drove Vijayan to attempt suicide. Vijayan had to be transported \nfrom the labor camp to a local hospital for immediate medical attention. \n252. While attempting to assist Vijayan in obtaining medical attention, Kadakkarappally was \ngrabbed by Darrell Snyder and/or one or more of the security guards. \n253. Kadakkarappally was taken forcefully by the arm and marched into a communal room in \nthe labor camp referred to by workers as “the TV room.” \n254. Upon arriving in the TV room, Kadakkarappally found two workers already held inside. \nEarlier that morning, Darrell Snyder and the security guards had grabbed Chellappan in the \ncommunal eating area and Kumar in his bunkhouse and forced both of them into the TV room, \nwhere they were kept under guard and prevented from leaving. \n255. In the TV room, Darrell Snyder informed Kadakkarappally that he and Kumar and \nChellappan were fired and would be taken to the airport to be deported to India. Snyder demanded \nthat Kadakkarappally stay inside the TV room, and Kadakkarappally was prevented from leaving \nthe TV room by security guards. \n256. Kuldeep Singh, upon realizing Snyder and the security guards were looking for him and \nintended to apprehend and detain him, hid himself and later fled the camp via an adjacent work \nThird Amended Complaint    44 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 45 of 72 PageID #:  3542\narea. \n257. Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan were detained in the TV room, under guard, \nfrom approximately 6 a.m. for several hours. \n258. Several security guards watched over Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan while \nthey were detained. Over the course of several hours, security guards denied Kadakkarappally, \nKumar, and Chellappan’s repeated requests to be let out of the TV room, to get something to drink, \nor to use the bathroom. \n259. When Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan’s co-workers attempted to come into the \nTV room to talk to the three workers kept inside, the security guards pushed them back. \n260. Confused and frightened, workers assembled outside the TV room to protest the treatment \nof Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan. \n261. At around 10 AM, Signal camp personnel finally permitted Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and \nChellappan to use the bathroom accompanied by security guards, one at a time. \n262. Around noon, Darrell Snyder and a Pascagoula police officer entered the TV room and \nthe officer questioned why Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan were there. Snyder said that \nthese workers had been fired and would be sent back to India. \n263. By  early  afternoon  on March  9,  2007,  local media,  religious  advocates,  and  other \nindividuals had gathered outside the camp gate to express their concern over the attempted suicide \nof Vijayan and the forced detention of Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan. \n264. Faced with growing protests by community members and Signal employees, Defendant \nSignal decided not to forcibly transport Kadakkarappally, Kumar, and Chellappan to the airport \nfor deportation to India, and instead escorted them from the Pascagoula labor camp. \n265. Other Indian H-2B workers, including these Plaintiffs, working at Signal’s Orange \nThird Amended Complaint    45 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 46 of 72 PageID #:  3543\nfacilities rapidly learned of the events at the Pascagoula labor camp on March 9, 2007. In response \nand out of fear for their continued well-being, some workers surreptitiously fled both camps. \n266. Within a few days of Plaintiffs’ and other Indian H-2B workers’ arrival at its labor camps \nin late 2006 and early 2007, Signal personnel had conducted meetings at the labor camps between \nPlaintiffs  and  representatives  from  specific  banks.  In  Orange,  these  meetings  were  with \nrepresentatives from Capital One Bank.  In Pascagoula, these meetings were with representatives \nfrom M&M Bank. \n267. At the instruction of Defendant Signal, Plaintiffs opened accounts with the designated \nbank  and  agreed  to  directly  deposit  their  wages  in  these  accounts.  Defendant  Signal’s \nestablishment of Plaintiffs’ accounts with these banks gave it unique access to and control over \nPlaintiffs’ funds. \n268. At some point before April 10, 2007, on information and belief, after some Indian H-2B \nworkers had fled Signal’s Mississippi camp, the bank with which those workers had established \nsimilar accounts denied those departed workers access to their bank accounts and invalidated their \nATM cards. \n269. Upon information and belief, that Mississippi bank refused the departed workers access \nto their own bank accounts at Defendant Signal’s behest. \n270. Indian H-2B workers still working at Signal labor camps, including the Plaintiffs, heard \nabout  the  difficulty  departed  Signal  workers  had  in  accessing  their  funds  through  Signal-\nestablished bank accounts and reasonably believed that similar action might be taken against them \nshould they try to leave Defendant Signal’s employ. \n271. The information about workers’ inability to access their money, combined with other \nfactors described herein, contributed to the reasonable beliefs of Plaintiffs and the other remaining \nThird Amended Complaint    46 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 47 of 72 PageID #:  3544\nIndian H-2B workers that if they tried to leave the employ of Defendant Signal they would face \nserious harm and/or threatened or actual abuse of the legal process. \n272. Defendant Signal’s actions on and after March 9, 2007 significantly intensified the \nreasonable fears of the remaining Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers in the Pascagoula and \nOrange camps that if they tried to leave Signal’s employ or oppose unlawful and coercive \nemployment conditions at Signal, including by consulting with counsel, they faced the threat of \nphysical restraint, detention, forced deportation, or other serious harms and/or abuses of the legal \nprocess. \n273. Throughout the spring and summer of 2007, Signal personnel in the Mississippi and Texas \ncamps held various meetings with the remaining Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers to \ndiscuss the status of Plaintiffs’ and other Indian H-2B workers’ visas and green card applications. \n274. Upon information and belief, during spring and summer 2007 Signal personnel conferred \namongst themselves and with the Recruiter Defendants and the Legal Facilitator Defendants via \nphone and/or e-mail to reach agreement on what should be said to workers attending the meetings. \n275. Soon after March 9, 2007, Defendant Signal held a camp-wide meeting in Pascagoula. \nSignal personnel told the Indian H-2B workers that Signal would sponsor their green cards if they \nstayed at Signal and obeyed Signal’s rules, and warned that if workers held any meetings against \nSignal’s interests, they would be terminated. As Signal understood would happen, workers at the \nOrange camp, including Plaintiffs, promptly learned what Signal personnel had said at this \nmeeting, and understood it would apply to workers at Orange, as well. \n276. In that same time period, Defendants Dewan and Burnett came to the Signal camp in \nOrange, Texas and again promised, in the presence of Signal personnel, that Signal, through its \nattorney Defendant Burnett, would make bona fide applications for green cards and obtain several \nThird Amended Complaint    47 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 48 of 72 PageID #:  3545\nH-2B visa extensions for the workers who had not been terminated by Signal (plaintiffs in the \nDavid Litigation, including David, Sulekha, Thangamani, Kandhasamy, Khuttan, Andrews and \nDhananjaya), and the other Indian H- 2B workers. Plaintiffs reasonably believed these promises. \n277. In meetings and conversations in spring and summer 2007, Defendant Signal, through its \nagents and employees at the Pascagoula and Orange facilities, continued to promise that Signal \nwould arrange for the H-2B visa extensions and green cards originally promised Plaintiffs when \nthey were recruited in India and the United Arab Emirates. \n278. At the same time as Defendant Signal was promising to arrange for H-2B visa extensions \nand green cards for the Plaintiffs as well as other Indian H-2B workers, Signal in fact was secretly \nevaluating all of the Indian workers with the intent not even to apply for visa extensions for certain \nof the Indian H-2B workers. \n279. Plaintiffs’  continuing  dependence on  Defendant  Signal  for  their  present  and  future \nimmigration status, their continuing high levels of indebtedness, as well as other factors reasonably \nled Plaintiffs to fear serious harm and/or abuse of the legal process if they left Signal’s employ. \n280. Under such circumstances, these Plaintiffs reasonably felt like they had no choice but to \ncontinue working for Signal. \n281. At various times relevant to Plaintiffs’ claims, Defendant Signal refused to confirm \nwhether valid H-2B visa extensions had in fact been obtained for Plaintiffs, coercing Plaintiffs to \ncontinue  working  for  Signal  in  the  hope  that  Signal  would  finally  resolve  their  uncertain \nimmigration status. \n282. In addition, through the spring of 2007, Signal continued to recruit workers, including \nsome of the Plaintiffs, to fill positions under the H-2B visas which Signal had been granted by the \nfederal  government.    As  a  result,  the  workers  continued  to  pay  recruitment  fees  with  the \nThird Amended Complaint    48 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 49 of 72 PageID #:  3546\nunderstanding they would have job opportunities at Signal.  The workers were told by Recruiter \nDefendants that Signal representatives would pick them up from the airport upon their arrival to \ntheir final destination in the United States and transported to Signal’s facility. When the workers, \nincluding some of the Plaintiffs, arrived at their final destination in the United States, no one from \nSignal was there to pick them up, and consequently the work opportunity for which they had \ncontracted was not provided to them. \n283. Some of the workers who had not been picked up at the airport, including some of the \nPlaintiffs, contacted Signal’s Orange, Texas facility to ask about their work opportunities and \nSignal failed to respond or told that there was no work opportunity for them at Signal. \n284. Some of the workers who were not picked up at the airport, including some of the \nPlaintiffs, and who were stranded in a country foreign to them, overcame obstacles and received \nhelp from third-parties to travel to Signal’s Orange, Texas facility.  After they arrived there, Signal \nmanagement told them that they needed to spend the night in the camp while Signal management \nfigured out what to do with the workers.  The next day, Signal management told them that they \nhad to take a test testing the same skills for which they had already been tested.  After taking the \ntest, Signal management told the workers that they had failed the test.  Signal used the test as a \npretext for not employing the workers when Signal, at that point, had no intention of employing \nthe workers who Signal had recruited to the United States.  \n285. Signal knew it had no intention of fulfilling its contractual promises and employing the \nworkers before the workers left India and made payments to Signal’s agents.  Nevertheless, Signal \ndid not inform the workers, including the Plaintiffs, of its intention to breach the contract nor did \nSignal ensure that its agents inform the Plaintiffs that Signal would not fulfill its contractual \nobligations.  Once the workers, including the Plaintiffs, arrived to Signal’s facilities in Texas and \nThird Amended Complaint    49 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 50 of 72 PageID #:  3547\nMississippi, Signal continued to defraud the workers and lie about its intention to not fulfill its \nobligation to employ the workers, including the Plaintiffs. \n286. Since first contracting with Defendants in India and the United Arab Emirates, none of \nPlaintiffs have yet to receive from Defendants the green cards Defendants promised them. Despite \nclear contractual provisions requiring them to do so, the Recruiter Defendants, the Legal Facilitator \nDefendants, and the Labor Broker Defendants have refused to refund any of the moneys Plaintiffs \npaid to them for unsuccessful green card and visa processing \n287. The fact that the Plaintiffs gave up opportunities for work and financial gain by leaving \nIndia, Singapore, Africa, Canada, and the Persian Gulf to come work in the United States at Signal \nwas known or foreseeable to Defendants. \n \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nTHE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2003 \nForced Labor (18 U.S.C. § 1589); and Trafficking with respect to peonage, slavery, involuntary \nservitude, or forced labor) (18 U.S.C. §1590) \n \nDefendants Signal International LLC, Signal International, Inc., the Recruiter Defendants \n(Global Resources, Sachin Dewan, and Dewan Consultants); and the Legal Facilitator \nDefendants (Malvern C.

Specifically,  Defendant  Signal  subjected  Plaintiffs  to  discriminatory  and  offensive \nmandatory room and board arrangements at the Signal labor camp in Orange. \n352. Defendant Signal did not subject its non-Indian and/or U.S. citizen employees to the same \nor similar room and board arrangements. \n353. As set forth in the preceding paragraphs, Defendant Signal also imposed discriminatory \n                                                      \n11 The Abandoned Plaintiffs do not assert claims under the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. § 1981. \nThird Amended Complaint    62 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 117   Filed 05/06/15   Page 63 of 72 PageID #:  3560\njob-related requirements and adverse terms and conditions of employment to which non-Indian \nand/or U.S. citizen employees were not similarly subject. \n354. As set forth in the preceding paragraphs, through the actions and statements of its \npersonnel referring to and/or directed at Plaintiffs and other Indian H-2B workers, Defendant \nSignal maintained an objectively hostile and abusive work environment on account of Plaintiffs’ \nrace, national origin, and/or alienage. \n355.

Id.    \n  Having considered the pending motions and the corresponding responses, the court denies \nthe Signal and Burnett Defendants’ motions to transfer pursuant to the first-to-file rule because \nthere is not a substantial overlap between the instant suit and Kurian David et al. v. Signal, Int’l, \nL.L.C. et al., the first filed suit.  See Civ. A. No. 08-1220 (E.D. La.). \nI.  Background \nA.  Procedural Background \n  On March 7, 2008, twelve individuals who were allegedly trafficked into the United States \nfiled a putative class action against the Defendants in the Eastern District of Louisiana asserting \ntrafficking, RICO, civil rights, and state law contract and fraud claims.1  See David v. Signal Int’l, \nLLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220 (E.D. La.).  That Court denied class certification;2 and, as a result of \nthis ruling, the Plaintiffs in the instant action filed suit in this District, where they were allegedly \nsubjected to deplorable working conditions at a Signal facility in Orange, Texas.3  (Doc. No. 39.)  \nOn August 7, 2013, the Plaintiffs filed their complaint in this court against the Burnett Defendants, \nthe Signal Defendants, Michael Pol, Global Resources, Inc., Sachin Dewan, Dewan Consultants \n                                                 \n  1.  The Plaintiffs presumably still have FLSA claims pending in the Eastern District of Louisiana.  (Doc. \nNo. 21, p. 10.) \n \n  2.  David v. Signal Int’l, LLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. Jan. \n3, 2012). \n \n  3.  Srinivasa Rao Gonna is the only Plaintiff in this lawsuit who worked in Signal’s Pascagoula, Mississippi \nfacility as opposed to their Orange, Texas facility. \n \n \nPage 2 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 56   Filed 07/16/14   Page 3 of 9 PageID #:  1226\nPvt. Ltd., Indo-Ameri Soft L.L.C., Kurella Rao, J&M Associates of Mississippi, Inc., J&M Marine \n& Industrial, L.L.C., and Billy R. Wilks.  The Plaintiffs allege that some or all of the Defendants \nviolated the following federal statutes: 1) The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act \nof 2003; 2) Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act; 3) The Civil Rights act of 1866; \nand 4) The Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871.  (Id.)  In addition, the Plaintiffs bring state law fraud, \nnegligent misrepresentation and breach of contract claims against all of the Defendants.  (Id.)   \nB.  Factual Background    \n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, approximately 590 men, including the Plaintiffs, \nwere allegedly trafficked into the United States through the federal government’s H-2B guest \nworker program to provide labor and services to the Signal Defendants.  (Doc. No. 39, p. 2.)  The \nPlaintiffs claim they were lured to work for Signal through the fraudulent promise of legal and \npermanent work-based immigration to the United States for themselves and their families.  (Id., p. \n4.)    Subsequently,  after  coming  to  the  United  States,  the  Plaintiffs  were  allegedly  denied \nemployment or were subjected to forced labor and other serious abuses at Signal operations in \nOrange, Texas and Pascagoula, Mississippi.  (Id., p. 5.)   \nII.  Jurisdiction  \n  The Plaintiffs seek recovery pursuant to several federal statutes.  For actions brought \nunder these statutory provisions, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon federal \nquestion jurisdiction.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1331; 29 U.S.C. § 216(b).  For the state law causes of \naction, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon supplemental jurisdiction.  See \n \nPage 3 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 56   Filed 07/16/14   Page 4 of 9 PageID #:  1227\n28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).  Venue is proper because the events giving rise to the above claims occurred \nwithin the confines of this District.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1391.  \nIII.  First to File Rule  \n  The Signal and Burnett Defendants move to transfer the instant case to the Eastern District \nof Louisiana pursuant to the First-Filed Doctrine.  (Doc. Nos. 14, 31.)  “Under the first-to-file \nrule, when related cases are pending before two federal courts, the court in which the case was last \nfiled may refuse to hear it if the issues raised by the cases substantially overlap.”  Int’l Fid. Ins. \nCo. v. Sweet Little Mexico Corp., 665 F.3d 671, 677 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting Cadle Co. v. \nWhataburger of Alice, Inc., 174 F.3d 599, 603 (5th Cir. 1999)).  “The first-to-file rule is a \ndiscretionary doctrine.” Jones v. Xerox Commercial Solutions, LLC, CIV. A. No. H-13-0650, \n2013 WL 3245957, at *2 (S.D. Tex. June 26, 2013) (quoting Cadle Co., 174 F.3d at 603).  The \nrule is utilized “to avoid the waste of duplication, to avoid rulings which may trench upon the \nauthority of sister courts, and to avoid piecemeal resolution of issues that call for a uniform result.”  \nSave Power Ltd. v. Syntek Fin. Corp., 121 F.3d 947, 950 (5th Cir. 1997).  The party wishing to \ntransfer the case has the burden to prove that transfer is warranted.  Jones, 2013 WL 3245957, at \n*2 (citing Sanofi–Aventis Deutschland GmbH v. Novo Nordisk, Inc., 614 F. Supp. 2d 772, 777 n. \n5 (E.D. Tex. 2009); VCode Holdings, Inc. v. Cognex Corp., No. 2:07–cv–138, 2007 WL 2238054, \nat *2 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 3, 2007); Buckalew v. Celanese, LTD., No. G–05–315, 2005 WL 2266619, \nat *1 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 16, 2005)).   \n  “In deciding whether to apply the first-to-file rule, the Court must resolve two questions: \n(1) are the two pending actions so duplicative or do they involve such substantially similar issues \n \nPage 4 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 56   Filed 07/16/14   Page 5 of 9 PageID #:  1228\nthat one court should decide the subject matter of both actions, and if so, (2) which of the two \ncourts should take the case.”  Datamize, Inc. v. Fid. Brokerage Servs., LLC, 2:03-CV-321-DF, \n2004  WL  1683171,  at  *3  (E.D.  Tex.  Apr.  22,  2004)  (citing  Texas  Instruments  v.  Micron \nSemiconductor, 815 F. Supp. 994, 997 (E.D. Tex. 1993)).  “The first-to-file rule does not require \nthat cases be identical, but merely that there is a substantial overlap in issues and parties.”  White \nv. Peco Foods, Inc., 546 F. Supp. 2d 339, 342 (S.D. Miss. 2008).   \nIV.  Analysis \n  The Defendants argue there is substantial overlap between the instant case and the first \nfiled case, David.  (Doc. Nos. 14, 31.)  While there are similarities in the two cases, the \nundersigned finds that the two cases do not involve such substantially similar parties and issues \nthat one court should decide the subject matter of both actions. \nA.  Parties \n  There is some overlap between the parties in David and the instant case, but it is not \nsubstantial.  While all of the Plaintiffs in the instant suit are also plaintiffs in David, as explained \nbelow, they are only asserting FLSA claims in David, which they do not assert here.4  (Doc. No. \n21, p. 10.)  Conversely, none of the David plaintiffs asserting non-FLSA claims are parties in the \ninstant case.  (Id., p. 8)  The David defendants and the Defendants in this suit are not completely \nidentical, but for purposes of this analysis, the court finds that the difference is insignificant.  \nWhile the first-to-file rule does not require identical parties, see Save Power Ltd., 121 F.3d at 950, \n                                                 \n4.  Even if the Plaintiffs in this case were at one point putative class members in the David class action \nlitigation, they were never parties since the class was never certified.  See Smith v. Bayer Corp., 131 S. Ct. 2368, \n2379 (2011) (holding that it is erroneous to believe a nonnamed class member is a party to class action litigation before \nthe class is certified, or if certification is ultimately denied). \n \n \nPage 5 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 56   Filed 07/16/14   Page 6 of 9 PageID #:  1229\n“the fact that the parties are different cuts against an argument for substantial overlap.”  Jones, \n2013 WL 3245957, at *4.  \nB.  Claims \n  Although the first-to-file rule also does not require the issues to completely overlap, “the \ncases should be more than merely related to support a motion to transfer when venue is otherwise \nappropriate.”  Buckalew v. Celanese, Ltd., CIV. A. No. G-05-315, 2005 WL 2266619, at *2 (S.D. \nTex. Sept. 16, 2005).  The instant suit and David are related to the extent that all of the claims \nasserted in this suit are also asserted by the different David Plaintiffs.  However, there is not \nsubstantial overlap among the claims in both suits.  As the District Court established in its opinion \ndenying the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification in David, each of the Plaintiffs’ claims \nrequire individualized proof as it pertains to that particular Plaintiff.  David v. Signal Int’l, LLC, \nCiv. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. Jan. 3, 2012).  Thus, not \nonly are each of the individual plaintiffs’ forced labor, trafficking, RICO and civil rights claims \ndifferent from one another in this suit, as explained below, they are entirely different from their \npending FLSA claims in David.  Therefore, the issues presented by the Plaintiffs here cannot be \nresolved in the David suit.  W. Gulf Mar. Ass’n v. ILA Deep Sea Local 24, S. Atl. & Gulf Coast \nDist. of ILA, AFL-CIO, 751 F.2d 721, 729 (5th Cir. 1985) (“. . . a district court may dismiss an \naction where the issues presented can be resolved in an earlier-filed action pending in another \ndistrict court.”).  \n \nPage 6 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 56   Filed 07/16/14   Page 7 of 9 PageID #:  1230\n  1.  Forced Labor and Trafficking \n  The  success  of  each  Plaintiff’s  forced  labor  and  trafficking  claims  is  dependent  on \nindividualized factors.  The question in a forced labor case is “whether Defendants’ coercive \nconduct was such that it could overcome the will of the victim so as to make him render his labor \ninvoluntary.”  David, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247 at 77.  “This question cannot be answered \nvia  generalized  class-wide  proof  but  rather  must  be  answered  individually  based  upon \nindividualized proof.”  Id.  Similarly, with trafficking, “individual issues will play a significant \npart” because involuntary servitude is an essential element of the claim.  Id. at 80-81.   \n  2.  RICO Claims \n  The success of each Plaintiff’s RICO claim is also based on each individual’s experience \nbecause the Plaintiff will be “required to prove that the [Defendants] committed the predicate acts \nupon which they rely for the pattern of racketeering activity.”  Id. at 92.  As stated above, proof \nof the predicate acts of trafficking and forced labor are “all premised on coercion” and “cannot be \nmade without resort to individualized proof.”  Id.  Additionally, in order to prove the fraud-based \npredicate acts, each Plaintiff will “have to prove first-party reliance on the alleged fraud that was \ndirected at them,” because “the question of individual reliance [is] paramount to resolving whether \nPlaintiffs’ injuries were caused by a RICO violation.”  Id. at 105-06. \n  3.  Civil Rights Claims \n  The Plaintiffs are suing the Signal Defendants under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 for violating their \nrights to “enjoy and benefit from non-discriminatory employment relationships” with the Signal \nDefendants.  (Doc. No. 39, p. 62.)  In order to obtain compensatory damages under this claim, as \n \nPage 7 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 56   Filed 07/16/14   Page 8 of 9 PageID #:  1231\nsought by the Plaintiffs, each “Plaintiff must prove actual injury to himself and that injury must be \nattributable to (caused by) the Defendant’s disparate treatment.”  David, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n114247, at *119.  For this reason, the outcome of each Plaintiff’s case will vary based on their \nindividualized experience. \n  4.  Violations of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 \n  The Plaintiffs allege that the Burnett Defendants violated the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1971 by \nviolating their right to be free from “forced labor, involuntary servitude, and trafficking in \npersons.”  (Doc. No. 39, p. 64.)  Forced labor, involuntary servitude, and trafficking all include \nan element of coercion, which requires an individualized analysis of each Plaintiff’s situation, as \nstated above.  David, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *128.   \n  As one can easily discern, none of the above causes of action involve substantially similar \nissues to the Plaintiffs’ FLSA claims pending in David, which include claims of violating the \nfederally mandated minimum wage laws.  The proof required for the FLSA claims and the \nremedies sought are distinct from the proof and remedies at issue in the instant matter.  Given that \nthere is not a substantial overlap of the claims between the David litigation and this case, and with \nthe exception of the Plaintiffs’ FLSA claims in David, none of the Plaintiffs in the instant suit and \nDavid overlap, the court’s denial of the Burnett Defendants’ motion to transfer will not result in \n“piecemeal resolution of issues that call for a uniform result.”  Save Power Ltd. v. Syntek Fin. \nCorp., 121 F.3d 947, 950 (5th Cir. 1997).   \n \nPage 8 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00498-RC-ZJH   Document 56   Filed 07/16/14   Page 9 of 9 PageID #:  1232\nV.  Conclusion \n \n  The court finds that the instant suit does not substantially overlap with the first-filed suit, \nDavid.  Accordingly, the Signal Defendants’ “Motion for Stay Pendente Lite and for Transfer \nPursuant to First Filed Rule” (Doc. No. 14), and the Burnett Defendants’ “Motion to Transfer \nVenue and Memorandum in Support” (Doc. No. 31) are DENIED.  As discussed previously, \nthese same motions filed in related cases—Marimuthu et. al v. Signal International L.L.C. et al., \n1:13-cv-499  (Doc.  Nos.  23,  36);  Meganathan  et  al.  v.  Signal  International  L.L.C.  et  al., \n1:13-cv-497 (Doc. Nos. 17, 12)—are also DENIED for the same reasons.   \n \nSIGNED this 16th day of July, 2014.\n   \n__________________________________________________\nZaacckk HHaawwtthhoorrnn\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n \nPage 9 of 9 \n \n ",

No. 126, 127, 128], the Signal \nEntities filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code on July \n12, 2015.  In re Signal Int’l, Inc, et al., No. 15-11498 (Bankr. D. Del. July 12, 2015) in the United States \nBankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”).1  On November 24, 2015, the \nBankruptcy Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Confirming Debtors’ First \nAmended Joint Plan of Liquidation Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code [ECF No. 555] (the \n“Confirmation Order”), confirming the Signal Entities’ plan of liquidation, which implemented the plan \nsupport agreement among the Plaintiffs, the Signal Entities and certain other parties, for the settlement of, \ninter alia, the Plaintiffs’ claims against the relevant Signal Entities.  Pursuant to the Plan, a litigation trust \n(the “Signal Litigation Trust”) has been created for the distribution of the settlement proceeds.  That process \nremains ongoing, as the Signal Litigation Trust distributed Trust Claim Forms in February and the Plaintiffs \nhave 60 days from the distribution date to submit their claim forms, which deadline was subsequently \nextended through June 15, 2016.    \n                                                      \n1 The other entities are: Signal Ship Repair, LLC (Case No. 15-11499), Signal Int’l, LLC (Case \nNo. 15-11500), Signal Int’l Texas GP, LLC (Case No. 15-11501), and Signal Int’l Texas, L.P. \n(Case No. 15-11502).  By the Bankruptcy Court’s order, all five cases are being jointly \nadministered with the Signal Int’l, Inc. case.  In re Signal Int’l, Inc., No. 15-11498 (Bankr. D. \nDel.

Dkt. No. 589].  As of that date, pursuant \nto the Confirmation Order, “any suit, legal action, or other proceeding … in any forum in the United States \nthat is released, stayed, or enjoined pursuant to Article XI of the Plan against or affecting any Released \nParty [the Signal Entities], shall be stayed, enjoined or otherwise prohibited from continuation as to any \nReleased Party.”  (Confirmation Order at 25.)   \nWith respect to the claims against the Burnett Defendants, twenty of the twenty-one Plaintiffs have \nreached a settlement with the Burnett Defendants. The Burnett Defendants have satisfied their obligations \nunder the agreement and the twenty participating Plaintiffs will agree to the dismissal of claims against the \nBurnett Defendants.  \nThe one Plaintiff that is not participating in the settlement with the Burnett Defendants is Srinivasa \nReddy Dalli. Plaintiffs’ counsel has been unable to locate Plaintiff Srinivasa Reddy Dalli to obtain his \nconsent to settle. In the related cases against Signal International, LLC  consolidated in the Eastern District \nof Louisiana under the case number 2:14-cv-02811-SM-DEK, Samuel, et al. v.
