    "summary": "<p>This case is part of the series of <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=33\">Signal International cases</a>. It is stayed during defendant's bankruptcy and settlement proceedings. Defendantโs bankruptcy terminated February 9, 2019, but the parties continue to coordinate the distribution of the settlement funds.</p><p>On Aug. 7, 2013, ten Indian guestworkers filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas for harm suffered as a result of an allegedly fraudulent and coercive employment recruitment scheme. Plaintiffs filed this suit after District Judge Jay Zainey <a href=\"http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/IM-LA-0010-0016.pdf\">denied class certification</a> on Jan. 3, 2012 in a related case, <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14377\"><i>David v. Signal International</i></a>.</p><p>Plaintiffs were allegedly brought into the United States to provide labor and services to defendant Signal International at its Orange, Texas site. Signal was based in Pascagoula, Mississippi and was in the business of providing repairs to offshore oil rigs in the Gulf Coast region. The complaint alleged that plaintiffs paid defendant Signal's recruiters as much as $25,000 for travel, visa, and recruitment fees, but upon arrival in the United States found out they would not receive the green cards promised to them. Instead, plaintiffs were forced to pay additional fees ($1050 per month) to live in racially segregated labor camps, and were subject to squalid living conditions and threats of both legal and physical harm if they complained about the conditions or decided not to provide labor. </p><p>Plaintiffs asserted claims under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (18 U.S.C. ยง1589 (forced labor) and 18 U.S.C. ยง1590 (trafficking)), the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. ยง1981), the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. ยง1985), the Thirteenth Amendment, as well as claims of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract. Plaintiffs were represented by private law firms.</p><p>In July 2014, Magistrate Judge Zack Hawthorn denied Signal's motion to transfer this case to the Eastern District of Louisiana. The plaintiffs in this case only overlapped with the <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14377\"><i>David</i></a> case insofar as their FLSA claims in the <i>David</i> case were concerned. Additionally, the plaintiffs in this case sued based on events at Signal's Orange, Texas site, whereas plaintiffs in cases pending in the Eastern District of Louisiana sued based on events at Signal's Pascagoula, Mississippi site. Magistrate Judge Hawthorn also issued a report and recommendation on July 30, 2014, denying Signal's motion to dismiss, holding that plaintiffs had pleaded enough factual content to draw the reasonable inference that the alleged pendent state law claims occurred in Texas, so that the Court had personal jurisdiction over defendants for alleged tortious acts committed there. Judge Crone adopted Magistrate Judge Hawthorn's report and recommendation on Sept. 9, 2014.</p><p>On Sept. 16, 2014, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint to allege that the Burnett (immigration attorney) defendants had violated the Ku Klux Klan Act and state tort law. On Feb. 27, 2015, Magistrate Judge Hawthorn recommended denying the Burnett defendants' motion to dismiss, finding that plaintiffs had validly pleaded the new claims. Judge Crone adopted this report and recommendation on Mar. 23, 2015. </p><p>In June 2015, Magistrate Judge Hawthorn severed and transferred Signal's cross-claims against co-defendants (immigration attorneys, recruiters, and labor brokers) to the Eastern District of Louisiana.</p><p>While discovery was underway, the Court stayed the case in July 2015 after Signal filed for bankruptcy. <i>In re Signal Intโl, Inc, et al.,</i> No. 15-11498 (Bankr. D. Del. July 12, 2015). As a part of the bankruptcy filings, the plaintiffs entered into a plan support agreement (PSA) which contemplated a settlement of the claims of this lawsuit against Signal entities through a consensual Chapter 11 plan proposed by Signal. The PSA, with a liquidation trust for distribution of settlement proceeds, became effective on Dec. 14, 2015.</p><p>In Dec. 2015, in the <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14378\">related EEOC case</a>, the EEOC announced that the parties had reached a <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/12-18-15.cfm\">settlement</a> for all cases, approved by the bankruptcy court. Signal would pay $5 million to 476 guestworkers through a claims process. All aggrieved individuals included in the litigation could receive relief in spite of the bankruptcy proceedings. Signal's CEO also issued an apology for its conduct.</p><p>In this case, <i>Marimuthu</i>, the parties are updating the court every 120 days as to the status of the bankruptcy proceedings. In September 2018, the court dismissed one plaintiff who became non-responsive and could not be located. </p><p>As of the parties' most recent July 3, 2019 update to the Court, the remaining nine plaintiffs had reached a settlement with the Burnett (immigration attorney) defendants. The plaintiffs advised that they would be dismissing their claims against them soon because the Burnett defendants had met their obligations under the settlement.  In addition, the plaintiffs reached a settlement with the Dewan (recruiter) defendants. They similarly had met their obligations and the plaintiffs planned to dismiss claims against them. The status report also noted that the Signal bankruptcy proceeding was closed on February 5, 2019. Part of the plan was to distribute the proceeds of the Signal Litigation Trust to plaintiffs, but none had been distributed. The automatic stay was no longer in effect because the bankruptcy case terminated. The plaintiffs asked the court to further stay the case while they coordinated dismissal of the Burnett and Dewan defendants and awaited distribution for the Signal Litigation Trust.</p><p>This case is ongoing. As of February 27, 2021, there have been no additional status reports. </p>",

' \n  ' \nv.  '    1:13-CV-499 \n  ' \nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL L.L.C. et al  ' \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION DENYING DEFENDANT SIGNALโS MOTION \nTO DISMISS (DOC. NO. 24) \n \n  This case is assigned to the Honorable Marcia Crone, United States District Judge, and is \nreferred to the undersigned United States magistrate judge to conduct all pretrial proceedings.  \n(Doc. No. 4.)  Before the undersigned magistrate judge is the โMotion to Dismiss Pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)โ1 (Doc. No. 24) filed by Defendants Signal International, L.L.C., Signal \nInternational,  Inc.,  Signal  International  Texas,  G.P.,  and  Signal  International  Texas,  L.P. \n(hereinafter collectively referred to as โSignalโ).  Because the Plaintiffs have pleaded enough \nfactual  content  to  draw  the  reasonable  inference  that  the  alleged  pendent  state  law  claims \noccurred in Texas, Signalโs Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 24) should be denied. \nI.  Background \nA.  Procedural Background \n  On March 7, 2008, twelve individuals who were allegedly trafficked into the United \nStates filed a putative class action against the Defendants in the Eastern District of Louisiana \nasserting trafficking, RICO, civil rights, and state law contract and fraud claims.  See David v. \n                                                        \n1.  As the Plaintiffs correctly point out, Signalโs motion exceeds the page limitations set forth in the Local \nRules.  See Local Rule CR-47(1).  The undersigned has already admonished the litigants to strictly adhere to the \npage limitations as it concerns appeals and objections to magistrate judge orders.  That same warning now applies to \nall briefs and pleadings filed by the parties and will be strictly enforced going forward.  \n  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 60   Filed 07/30/14   Page 2 of 9 PageID #:  736\nSignal Intโl, LLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220 (E.D. La.).  That Court denied class certification;2 and, as \na result of this ruling, the Plaintiffs in the instant action filed suit in this District, where they were \nallegedly subjected to deplorable working conditions at a Signal facility in Orange, Texas.  (Doc. \nNo. 1.)  On August 7, 2013, the Plaintiffs filed their complaint in this court against the Signal \nDefendants, Malvern C. Burnett, Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, L.L.C., Law Offices of \nMalvern C. Burnett, A.P.C., Global Resources, Inc., Sachin Dewan and Dewan Consultants Pvt. \nLtd.  (Id.)   \nB.  Factual Background    \n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, approximately 590 men, including the Plaintiffs, \nwere allegedly trafficked into the United States through the federal governmentโs H-2B guest \nworker program to provide labor and services to the Signal Defendants.  (Doc. No. 1, p. 1.)  The \nPlaintiffs claim they were lured to work for Signal through the fraudulent promise of legal and \npermanent work-based immigration to the United States for themselves and their families.  (Id., \np. 4.)  Subsequently, after coming to the United States, the Plaintiffs were allegedly subjected to \nforced labor and other serious abuses at Signal operations in Orange, Texas.  (Id, p. 5.)   \nII.  Jurisdiction  \n  The Plaintiffs seek recovery pursuant to several federal statutes.  For actions brought \nunder these statutory provisions, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon federal \nquestion jurisdiction.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331; 29 U.S.C. ยง 216(b).  For the state law causes of \naction, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon supplemental jurisdiction.  See \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(a).  Venue is proper because the events giving rise to the above claims \noccurred within the confines of this District.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391.   \n                                                        \n  2.  David v. Signal Intโl, LLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. Jan. \n3, 2012). \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 60   Filed 07/30/14   Page 3 of 9 PageID #:  737\nIII.  Rule 12(b)(6) Standard \nRule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes dismissal of a complaint \nthat fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6).  A Rule \n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss โis viewed with disfavor and is rarely granted.โ  Harrington v. State \nFarm Fire & Cas. Co., 563 F.3d 141, 147 (5th Cir. 2009).  When a court analyzes a Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion, it โaccepts โall well-pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light most favorable to the \nplaintiff.โโ  In re Katrina Beaches Litig., 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Martin K. \nEby Constr. Co. v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit, 369 F.3d 464, 467 (5th Cir. 2004)).  A court \nshould grant such a motion only when the complaint fails to contain โenough facts to state a \nclaim to relief that is plausible on its face.โ  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 \n(2007).  A claim is plausible on its face โwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the \ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.โ  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  โThreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of \naction, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.โ  Id. \nIV.  Analysis \n  Signal moves to dismiss the Plaintiffsโ 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1981, 1985 claims and pendent state \nlaw claims of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract.  (Doc. No. 24.)  Signal \nfirst  contends  that  the  complaint  should  be  dismissed  because  the  Plaintiffs  failed  to \nmeaningfully engage in a choice-of-law analysis in the complaint in order to determine which \nstate or countryโs law applies.  (Id., p. 9.)  Furthermore, Signal argues that the court should find \nthat the state law claims are implausible โbecause it is not likely the Texas Supreme Court would \napply state law to transactions that occurred abroad.โ  (Id., p. 3)  Finally, Signal argues โto the \ndegree that the Complaint refers to facts that occurred abroadโ as to the Plaintiffsโ ยง 1981 and ยง \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 60   Filed 07/30/14   Page 4 of 9 PageID #:  738\n1985 claims, that portion of the complaint should be dismissed.  (Id., p. 1.) \n  The Plaintiffs respond that a choice of law analysis is not required in their complaint, \nthey have provided adequate facts that their state law claims occurred in Texas, and Texas law \napplies to their claims.  (Doc. No. 28.)  Specifically, the Plaintiffs argue the complaint makes \nclear that the tortious actions originated, were performed, and continued to occur in Texas, \nspecifically at the Texas Labor Camp located in Orange, Texas.  (Id.)  The Plaintiffs allege that \nwhile recruiters working on Signalโs behalf initially lured and defrauded the Plaintiffs abroad, \nSignal ratified the recruitersโ actions by continuing to defraud the Plaintiffs upon their arrival in \nTexas.   (Id., p. 6.)  Finally, they argue that their ยง 1981 and ยง 1985 claims should not be \ndismissed because they have alleged their rights under these statutes were violated in Texas.  \n(Id., p. 7.) \n  1.  Choice of Law Analysis  \nFirst, Signal argues the complaint is defective because it does not adequately address any \nchoice of law analysis that would convince the court that Texas state law applies to the pendent \nstate law claims.  (Doc. No. 14.)  A court has discretion to exercise jurisdiction over state-law \nclaims when federal  question jurisdiction is proper and the state-law  claims derive from  a \ncommon nucleus of operative facts.  Arena v. Graybar Elec. Co., Inc., 669 F.3d 214, 221 (5th \nCir. 2012); 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367.  Federal courts apply the forum stateโs conflict-of-law rules to \ndetermine what law governs the state-law claims.  Bailey v. Shell Western E&P, Inc., 609 F.3d \n710, 722 (5th Cir. 2010), citing Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 496 (1941).  \nTexas  courts  first  determine  whether  there  is  a  conflict  between  Texas  law  and  another \npotentially applicable law.  Id. (citation omitted.)  If there is no such conflict, a choice-of-law \nanalysis is unnecessary.  Id. (citing SAVA gumarska in kemijska industria d.d. v. Advanced \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 60   Filed 07/30/14   Page 5 of 9 PageID #:  739\nPolymer Sciences, Inc., 128 S.W.3d 304, 314 (Tex. App.โDallas 2004, no pet.)).  But, where \nthere  is  a  conflict  of  laws,  Texas  follows  the  โmost  significant  relationshipโ  test  of  the \nRestatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws.  Id. (citing  Minn. Mining & Mfg. Co. v. Nishika \nLtd., 953 S.W.2d 733, 735 (Tex. 1997)).    \nSignal does not dispute the court has proper federal question jurisdiction over the pendent \nstate-law claims.  Signal argues the Plaintiffs โbear the risk of punishment for notโ engaging in a \nchoice of law analysis in their Complaint.  (Doc. No. 24, p. 14.)  Signal does not cite, and the \nundersigned cannot find, any binding Fifth Circuit authority for a 12(b)(6) dismissal because the \ncomplaint fails to plead the particular stateโs law at issue for the pendent state law claims.  \nAlthough Signal argues, in passing and without citation, that the Indian Contracts Act disallows \nthe enforcement of a contract if it violates the public policy of India, Signal has not sufficiently \ndemonstrated how this conflicts with Texas law.  Even if a choice-of-law analysis were required, \nthere is no authority for dismissing a complaint under 12(b)(6) for failing to analyze in the \ncomplaint which state law controls under the โmost significant relationshipโ test promulgated in \nthe Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws.  Signal also fails to persuasively argue under the \nโmost significant relationship testโ that Indian law would apply.  In any event, Signalโs choice-\nof-law argument is meaningless.  As discussed below, the Plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts to \ndraw  the  reasonable  inference  that  Signalโs  alleged  misconduct  occurred  in  Texas,  thereby \ninvoking Texas law to govern the state causes of action.  \n2.  State Law Claims that are โExtraterritorial in Natureโ \nSignal  also  argues  that  because  each  pendent  state  law  claim  is  predicated  on  a \nrecruitment process that occurred on the Arabian peninsula or India, the Texas Supreme Court \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 60   Filed 07/30/14   Page 6 of 9 PageID #:  740\nwould hold the indigenous laws of these countries would apply to the state law claims.3  (Doc. \nNo. 24, pp. 10-11.)  The complaint is replete with allegations that Signalโs tortious actions \noccurred in Texas.  The following is a summary of the Plaintiffsโ complaint (Doc. No. 1):   \nThe Plaintiffs were recruited by Signal and its recruiters, both in \nthe United States and abroad, to work at Signalโs Texas Labor \nCamp.  Because Signalโs need for workers was immediate, they \nrepresented to the Plaintiffs that they would first acquire temporary \nwork visas (H-2B) because the visas could be obtained faster than \ngreen cards, but that the Defendants would also apply for green \ncards on the Plaintiffsโ behalf.  The Plaintiffs accepted Signalโs \noffer, paid their fees, and were transported to the Texas Labor \nCamp in the United States to perform work for Signal.  Once at the \nTexas Labor Camp, Signal ratified the actions of the recruiters, \nbreached  its  obligations,  and  defrauded  the  Plaintiffs  regarding \ntheir immigration status.   \n  In  the  Texas  Labor  Camp,  throughout  the  spring  and \nsummer of 2007, Signal representatives held meetings with the \nPlaintiffs and other workers to discuss the status of the Plaintiffs \nand  other  Indian  workersโ  visas.    Through  its  agents,  Signal \ncontinued  to  represent  that  it  would  arrange  for  H-2B  visa \nextensions. At no point during these meetings were the Plaintiffs \ninformed that they would not be receiving green cards.  Signal \nwas, in fact, evaluating the workers, including the Plaintiffs, and \nhad no  intention of applying for visa extensions for all of the \nworkers  or  applying  for  green  cards  for  any  of  the  workers.  \nDespite many promises to do so, the Defendants never provided \nthe green cards or permanent residency. In fact, no Defendant ever \neven  applied  for  a  green  card  for  any  Plaintiff.   And,  despite \ncontractual  provisions  that  clearly  require  them  to  do  so,  the \nDefendants have failed to refund any of the money the Plaintiffs \npaid to them for green card and visa processing. \n \nWhen deciding a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the court must consider these facts as true.  \nIn re Katrina Beaches Litig., 495 F.3d at 205.  From these allegations, the Plaintiffs have clearly \npleaded enough factual content to draw the reasonable inference that the alleged pendent state \nlaw claims of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract occurred in Texas.  \nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662 at 678.   Even though the complaint alleges Signalโs actions and the \n                                                        \n  3.  Signalโs assertion that the entire complaint contains allegations of activity that only occurred abroad is \nincorrect.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 60   Filed 07/30/14   Page 7 of 9 PageID #:  741\nPlaintiffsโ injuries occurred in Texas and India, Signal has not cited to any persuasive authority \nthat this subjects the Plaintiffsโ entire complaint to a 12(b)(6) dismissal. 4   In fact, district courts \nhave the power to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over foreign law claims that form part of \nthe same case or controversy.  In re BP p.l.c. Sec. Litig., 843 F. Supp. 2d 712, 799 (S.D. Tex. \n2012) (citing 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(c)).  \n3.  Pro Tanto Dismissal \nFinally, Signal moves to dismiss the complaint pro tanto to the degree the complaint \nrefers to facts that occurred abroad with regard to the Plaintiffsโ claims under ยงยง 1981 and 1985.  \nSignal begins with the premise that ยงยง 1981 and 1985 claims are not extraterritorial.  Signal asks \nthe court to compare the complaint in this suit with 1) the first amended complaint5 in David et \nal. v. Signal, Intโl, L.L.C. et. al. and 2) one sentence in the David courtโs order6 denying class \ncertification concerning what damages are attributable to the David plaintiffsโ discrimination \nclaims.  Signal argues this comparison shows that at least part of the Plaintiffsโ ยงยง 1981 and 1985 \nclaims in this case occurred abroad.   \n In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion,  a court  typically does not  look  beyond the \ncomplaint.    However,  a  court  may  consider  attachments  to  briefing  if  the  documents  are \nreferenced  in  the  complaint,  central  to  the  complaint,  referenced  by  the  parties,  and  their \n                                                        \n  4.  Signal appears to argue that this court should dismiss the instant case because of the โforeign natureโ of \nthe claims.  However, none of the cases cited by Signal are applicable to the instant case in which Signal allegedly \ncommitted torts within Texas that caused the Plaintiffs injuries within Texas.  See e.g. Boureslan v. Aramco, \nArabian Am. Oil Co., 892 F.2d 1271 (5th Cir. 1990) (An American citizen brought a Title VII suit, alleging that \nwhile he was working in Saudi Arabia, the American corporation which employed him discriminated against him \nbecause of his race, religion and national origin.); Coca-Cola Co. v. Harmar Bottling Co., 218 S.W.3d 671, 680-81 \n(Tex.  2006)  (โIt  is  an  especially  sensitive  matter  for  a  jurisdiction  to  extend  its  laws  governing  economic \ncompetition beyond its borders.โ); E.E.O.C. v. Arabian Am. Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244 (1991) (An American citizen \nbrought a Title VII action against a United States employer, alleging that while he was working abroad, the \nemployer discriminated against him because of his race, religion, and national origin.). \n   \n  5.  David v. Signal Intโl, L.L.C., Civ. A. No. 08-1220 (E.D. La. April 29, 2008) (Doc. No. 47). \n \n  6.  David et al. v. Signal, Intโl, L.L.C. et. al., Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247 (E.D. \nLa. Jan. 3, 2012). \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 60   Filed 07/30/14   Page 8 of 9 PageID #:  742\nauthenticity is not in dispute.  See Walch v. Adjutant Gen. Depโt, 533 F.3d 289, 293โ94 (5th Cir. \n2008) (citing In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007)); Causey v. \nSewell Cadillac-Chevrolet, Inc., 394 F.3d 285, 288 (5th Cir. 2004).  The David litigation is not \nmentioned in the complaint; and therefore, the David first amended complaint and the David \ncourtโs order denying class certification are not central to the Plaintiffsโ complaint in this case.  \nFurthermore, Signal failed to include the documents in its briefing to this court.  Obviously, \nwithout being able to consider the David court documents, Signalโs motion should not be granted \non this basis.   \nV.  Recommendation \n  For the reasons stated above, Signalโs โMotion to Dismiss Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(b)(6)โ (Doc. No. 24) should be denied. \nVI.  Objections \n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(c) (Supp. IV 2011), each party to this action has the \nright to file objections to this report and recommendation.  Objections to this report must (1) be \nin writing, (2) specifically identify those findings or recommendations to which the party objects, \nand (3) be served and filed within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this \nreport.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(c); Fed R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2).  A party who objects to this report \nis entitled to a de novo determination by the United States District Judge of those proposed \nfindings and recommendations to which a specific objection is timely made.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง \n636(b)(1)(c); Fed R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3).   \n  A partyโs failure to file specific, written objections to the proposed findings of fact and \nconclusions of law contained in this report, within fourteen (14) days of being served with a copy \nof this report, bars that party from: (1) entitlement to de novo review by the United States \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 60   Filed 07/30/14   Page 9 of 9 PageID #:  743\nDistrict Judge of the findings of fact and conclusions of law, see Rodriguez v.

NO. 38) \n \nThis case is assigned to the Honorable Marcia A. Crone, United States District Judge, and \nis referred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge for all pretrial matters.  Before the \nundersigned is a โMotion to Dismiss Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)โ filed by Malvern C. \nBurnett, the Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C., and Gulf Coast Immigration Law \nCenter,  L.L.C.  (hereinafter  referred  to  interchangeably  as  โBurnettโ  and  โthe  Burnett \nDefendantsโ).  (Doc. No. 38.)  The undersigned has considered the pending motion and the \ncorresponding response.    (Doc. No. 42.)  The Burnett Defendantsโ motion should be granted in \npart as to the Plaintiffsโ Ku Klux Klan Act claim because the Plaintiffs failed to allege Burnett \nwas motivated by racial animus.  The motion to dismiss should also be granted as to the state \nlaw claims on the grounds that the complaint fails to adequately allege the conduct underlying \nthose  claims  occurred  in  Texas.    However,  the  Plaintiffs  shall  have  leave  to  amend  their \ncomplaint as to KKKA and state law claims.   Burnettโs motion should be denied in every other \nrespect because the Plaintiffs sufficiently stated a TVPA claim upon which relief can be granted, \nand a motion for summary judgment is the proper vehicle to prove the Plaintiffs state law claims \nare barred by the statute of limitations. \n   \n1 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 64   Filed 08/12/14   Page 2 of 14 PageID #:  771\nI.  Background \nA.  Procedural Background \n  On March 7, 2008, twelve individuals who were allegedly trafficked into the United \nStates filed a putative class action against the Defendants in the Eastern District of Louisiana.  \nSee David v. Signal Intโl, LLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220 (E.D. La.).  That Court denied class \ncertification;1 and, as a result of this ruling, the Plaintiffs in the instant action filed suit in this \nDistrict,  where  they  were  allegedly  subjected  to  deplorable  working  conditions  at  Signalโs \nOrange, Texas facilities.  (Doc. No. 1.)   On August 7, 2013, the Plaintiffs filed their original \ncomplaint in this court against the following Defendants: Burnett, Signal International, L.L.C., \nSignal  International,  Inc., Signal  International  Texas, G.P.,  Signal  International  Texas,  L.P. \n(hereinafter  referred  to  as  โSignalโ),  Global  Resources,  Inc.,  Sachin  Dewan,  and  Dewan \nConsultants Pvt. Ltd.  Subsequently, the Burnett Defendants filed the instant motion to dismiss \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  (Doc. No. 38.)    \nB.  Factual Background     \n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, approximately 590 men, including the Plaintiffs, \nwere allegedly trafficked into the United States through the federal governmentโs H-2B guest \nworker program to provide labor and services to the Signal Defendants.   (Doc. No. 1.)  The \nPlaintiffs claim they were lured to work for Signal through the fraudulent promise of legal and \npermanent work-based immigration to the United States for themselves and their families.  (Id., \np. 4.)  Subsequently, after coming to the United States, the Plaintiffs were allegedly subjected to \nforced labor and other serious abuses at Signal operations in Orange, Texas.  (Id.)    \n                                         \n  1.  David v. Signal Intโl, LLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. \nJan. 3, 2012). \n2 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 64   Filed 08/12/14   Page 3 of 14 PageID #:  772\n  The Burnett Defendants consist of Malvern C. Burnett and his two corporations: Gulf \nCoast Immigration Law Center, L.L.C. and Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C.  The \nPlaintiffs  accuse  Burnett  of  conspiring  with  Signal  and  other  Defendants  to  recruit  Indian \nwelders and pipefitters to fill anticipated H-2B guest worker jobs at Signalโs Orange, Texas \noperations with false promises of permanent residency in the United States for the workers and \ntheir families.  (Id.)     \nII.   Jurisdiction \n  The Plaintiffs seek recovery pursuant to several federal statutes.  For actions brought \nunder these statutory provisions, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon federal \nquestion jurisdiction.   See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331; 29 U.S.C. ยง 216(b).  For the state law causes of \naction, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon supplemental jurisdiction.   See \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(a).   Venue is proper because the events giving rise to the above claims \noccurred within the confines of this District.   See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391. \nIII.   Rule 12(b)(6) Standard \nRule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes dismissal of a complaint \nthat fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).   A Rule \n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss โis viewed with disfavor and is rarely granted.โ   Harrington v. State \nFarm Fire & Cas. Co., 563 F.3d 141, 147 (5th Cir. 2009).  When a court analyzes a Rule \n12(b)(6) motion, it โaccepts โall well-pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light most \nfavorable to the plaintiff.โโ   In re Katrina Beaches Litig., 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007) \n(quoting Martin K. Eby Constr. Co. v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit, 369 F.3d 464, 467 (5th Cir. \n2004)).  A court should grant such a motion only when the complaint fails to contain โenough \nfacts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.โ   Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 \n3 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 64   Filed 08/12/14   Page 4 of 14 PageID #:  773\nU.S. 544, 570 (2007).   A claim is plausible on its face โwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content \nthat  allows  the  court  to  draw  the  reasonable  inference  that  the  defendant  is  liable  for  the \nmisconduct alleged.โ   Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  โThreadbare recitals of the \nelements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.โ   Id. \nIV.  Analysis \n  The Plaintiffs allege Burnett violated the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization \nAct, 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1589, 1590 (โTVPRAโ) and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1985(3) (โKKKAโ).   (Doc. No. 1.)  The Plaintiffs have also asserted state law claims of fraud, \nnegligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract.    (Id.)   First, Burnett argues the Plaintiffs \nhave failed to provide sufficient facts to state any claim.  (Doc. No. 38.)   Second, Burnett \nstates that the laws of Texas could not apply to the state law claims because the underlying facts \nused to support the state law claims occurred in India or the United Arab Emirates.  Third, \nBurnett asserts the Plaintiffsโ state law claims are barred by the statute of limitations.  (Id.) \nA.   Federal Claims \n  Burnett generally argues the Plaintiffs failed to state more than mere conclusions and \nrecitals of statutory language without any basis in fact in their complaint.   In particular, Burnett \nargues that the Plaintiffs only allege in a conclusory fashion that Burnett violated the KKKA and \nthe TVPRA.   \n  1.  Ku Klux Klan Act 1871 \n \n  The four elements a plaintiff must allege to state a cause of action under the KKKA, 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1985(3), are as follows: โ(1) the defendants must conspire; (2) for the purpose of \ndepriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of \nthe laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws; and (3) the defendants must act in \n4 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 64   Filed 08/12/14   Page 5 of 14 PageID #:  774\nfurtherance of the object of the conspiracy, whereby (4) one was (a) injured in his person or \nproperty or (b) deprived of having and exercising any right or privilege of a citizen of the United \nStates.โ   McLellan v. Mississippi Power & Light Co., 545 F.2d 919, 923 (5th Cir. 1977).  โThe \nlanguage requiring intent to deprive of equal protection, or equal privileges and immunities, \nmeans  that  there  must  be  some  racial,  or  perhaps  otherwise  class-based,  invidiously \ndiscriminatory animus behind the conspiratorsโ action.โ   Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88, \n102 (1971).   In their complaint, the Plaintiffs allege that the Burnett Defendants โconspired, \nagreed, planned and coordinated for, and acted in furtherance of, the purpose of depriving \nPlaintiffs of equal protection of their rights under the Thirteenth Amendment.โ  (Doc. No. 1, p. \n71.)    The  Plaintiffs  further  state  that  the  Burnett  Defendants  were  โmotivated  by  racial, \nanti-Indian, and/or anti-immigrant animus when they conspired to deprive Plaintiffs of their \nrights and acted in furtherance of a conspiracy to deprive Plaintiffs of their rights.โ  (Id.)   The \nundersigned agrees with Burnett that the Plaintiffs have only alleged the elements of a claim \nunder the KKKA.  Nowhere in the complaint have the Plaintiffs pled any facts or factual \ncontent that Burnett was motivated by racial animus to deprive the Plaintiffs of their right to \nequal protection under the law.  Therefore, the undersigned recommends granting Burnettโs \nmotion to dismiss as it relates to the Plaintiffโs KKKA claims against Burnett.  The Plaintiffs \nwill be granted leave to amend their complaint within seven (7) days of the date the district court \nadopts this report and recommendation, if the district court does so. 2      \n  2.   Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act   \n  The forced labor provision of the TVPRA (18 U.S.C. ยง 1589), provides that: \n                                         \n  2.  See Texas Indigenous Council v. Simpkins, 544 F. Appโx 418, 421 (5th Cir. 2013) (โGranting leave to \namend is especially appropriate . . . when the trial court has dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.  \nPermission should be denied only if it appears to a certainty that plaintiffs cannot state a claim showing they are \nentitled to relief or defendant will be unduly prejudiced.โ) (citations omitted). \n \n5 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 64   Filed 08/12/14   Page 6 of 14 PageID #:  775\n(a) Whoever knowingly provides or obtains the labor or services of \na person by any one of, or by any combination of, the following \nmeans-- \n  (1) by means of force, threats of force, physical restraint, or \n  threats  of  physical  restraint  to  that  person  or  another \n  person; \n  (2) by means of serious harm or threats of serious harm to \n  that person or another person; \n  (3) by means of the abuse or threatened abuse of law or \n  legal process; or \n  (4) by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to \n  cause  the  person  to  believe  that,  if  that  person  did  not \n  perform  such  labor  or  services,  that  person  or  another \n  person would suffer serious harm or physical restraint,  \nshall be punished as provided under subsection (d). \n \n(c) In this section: \n  (1) The term โabuse or threatened abuse of law or legal \n  processโ means the use or threatened use of a law or legal \n  process, whether administrative, civil, or criminal, in any \n  manner  or  for  any  purpose  for  which  the  law  was  not \n  designed, in order to exert pressure on another person to \n  cause that person to take some action or refrain from taking \n  some action. \n \n  The Plaintiffs have alleged Burnett knowingly obtained the Plaintiffsโ labor by using the \nlegal process in a way it was not designed in order to induce the Plaintiffs to move to the United \nStates to work for Signal.   See 18 U.S.C. ยง 1589(a)(3).  The Plaintiffs allege Burnett acted as \nSignalโs agent for the โpurposes of recruiting and providing Indian welders and fitters to fill \nanticipated H-2B guest worker jobs at Signalโs Orange, Texas operations.โ  (Doc. No. 1, p. 15.)  \nAllegedly, Burnett falsely promised the Plaintiffs that: โ(1) they would be eligible for permanent \nresidency through their employment with Signal; (2) Defendants would apply for permanent \nresidency in the United States on behalf of Plaintiffs; (3) Defendants would extend Plaintiffsโ \nH-2B visas while they were being processed for permanent residency; and (4) Plaintiffs would \nhave steady and ongoing work opportunities in the United States with Signal.โ  (Id., p. 72.)  \nBurnett allegedly made these false statements in order to recruit the Plaintiffs to travel to the \n6 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 64   Filed 08/12/14   Page 7 of 14 PageID #:  776\nUnited States to work for Signal.   (Id., p. 73.)    Reasonably relying on these promises, the \nPlaintiffs signed green card contracts, paid the required fees, and prepared to travel to Signalโs \nfacilities.  (Id., p. 18.)   \n  In  approving  the  Plaintiffsโ  H-2B  visa  petitions,  the  United  States  Citizenship  and \nImmigration Service โrelied on the accuracy of the petitionsโ stated 10-month period of labor \nneed and the representation that Signalโs need was based on a one-time, peak-load, temporary \ndemand.โ   (Id., p. 19.)  The Defendants  โknew that the stated period of need in  Signalโs \napplications for labor certifications and for H-2B visas were inconsistent with Signalโs promises \nof  permanent  residency  to  Plaintiffs  and  its  actual  projected  labor  need  and,  therefore, \nDefendants knew these statements to the government were false.โ   Id.   Finally, the Plaintiffs \nallege Burnett elicited payment from the Plaintiffs for the H-2B visas that were procured by \nmaking false statements to the federal government.   (Id., p. 20.) \n  Once the Plaintiffs arrived at the Texas Labor camp, โ[a]t various times, Signal refused to \nconfirm  whether  it  had  obtained  visa  extensions  for  Plaintiffs.โ    (Id.,  p.  32.)    Faced  with \ncrushing debtโa result of the recruitment and legal fees paid to the Defendants (including \nBurnett)โand the threat of deportation should they complain, the Plaintiffs โfelt compelled to \ncontinue working for Signal despite the dreadful conditions at the Texas Labor Camp.โ  (Id., p. \n6.)   Despite repeated representations that Burnett was each Plaintiffโs lawyer for immigration \npurposes, they were generally not allowed to speak or meet with him.  (Id., p. 25.)   In an \ne-mail Burnett sent to another Defendant, he speculated about whether he should threaten his \nclients with immediate deportation to prevent them from stopping payments on his legal fees.  \n(Id., p. 25.)    \n  Burnett abused the legal process by using the temporary H2-B visa process in a way it \n7 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 64   Filed 08/12/14   Page 8 of 14 PageID #:  777\nwas not intended in order to lure the Plaintiffs into working for Signal.   The H2-B visa process \nis only meant to bring workers to the United States temporarily and not as a pathway to legal \nresidency.  However, Burnett used the visa as a way to induce the Plaintiffs to the United States \nto work for Signal under the guise that Burnett would later apply for green cards, and a visa \nextension if necessary, which according to the complaint, was never Burnettโs intention.  (Id., p. \n18.)   Burnett also allegedly abused the legal process by exacting fees for obtaining the H2-B \nvisas  which  were  obtained  by  making  false  statements  to  the  federal  government.    The \nundersigned finds that these allegations are sufficient to state a plausible TVPRA claim.   \nB.  State Law Claims \n  1.  Extraterritorial Conduct \n  In cursory fashion, Burnett argues without citing any authority, that โall of the alleged \nconduct that is asserted as support of the state based causes of action occurred in India or the \nUnited Arab Emiratesโ; and, therefore, only Indian or โArabianโ law applies to the instant case.   \n(Doc. No. 38, p. 15.)   Burnett also posits that โgiven the totality of the allegations, and the very \nfew factual assertions of conduct by Burnett, it is submitted that there was no actionable conduct \nby Burnett under either countryโs laws.โ      \n  First, the undersigned finds that Burnett has failed to provide any legal support that under \nIndian or United Arab Emirates law, Burnettโs conduct is not โactionable.โ  โThe district court \nis not required to conduct its own research into the content of foreign law if the party urging its \napplication declines to do so.โ   Mutual Service Ins. Co. v. Frit Industries, Inc., 358 F.3d 1312, \n1321 (11th Cir. 2004).  The undersigned simply will not trust Burnettโs โsubmissionโ that \nBurnettโs alleged conduct is not actionable under those countriesโ laws.    \n  However, Burnettโs point that the conduct used to support the state law claims appears to \n8 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 64   Filed 08/12/14   Page 9 of 14 PageID #:  778\nhave only occurred abroad is well-taken.   In reviewing the complaint, the Plaintiffs adequately \nallege their state law claims of fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract, but it is \nunclear if any of Burnettโs alleged conduct used to support the claims occurred in Texas.  The \nPlaintiffs only mention that after they arrived in Texas, Burnett โquelledโ organizing efforts and \nrefused  to  meet  with  the  Plaintiffs  to  provide  legal  advice.    (Doc.  No.  42,  p.  6.)    Those \nallegations alone are simply insufficient to support the above state law claims.  The Plaintiffs \nalso ask the court to cross-reference their briefing that responded to Signalโs contentions that \ntheir alleged conduct only occurred abroad.  (Id., p. 2, n.2.)  While it is true that the instant \ncomplaint is replete with allegations that Signal committed the state law torts in Texas, the same \ncannot  be  said  for  Burnett.    Accordingly,  the  undersigned  recommends  granting  Burnettโs \nmotion to dismiss the Plaintiffโs state law claims on this basis.  The Plaintiffs will be granted \nleave to amend their complaint within seven (7) days of the date the district court adopts this \nreport and recommendation, if the district court does so.   \n  2.   Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation3     \n  Burnett also claims the Plaintiffsโ complaint only states โlegal conclusionsโ in relation to \nthe pendent state law claims.   However, the undersigned finds the Plaintiffs have provided \nsufficient  facts  to  support  their  argument  that  Burnett  is  liable  for  fraud  and  negligent \nmisrepresentation.    Under  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  9(b),  โa  party  must  state  with \nparticularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.  Malice, intent, knowledge, and \nother conditions of a personโs mind may be alleged generally.โ   In their complaint, the Plaintiffs \nallege Burnett knowingly and negligently made the following materially false promises to the \n                                         \n  3.  The undersigned recognizes that dismissal has already been recommended on the Plaintiffsโ state law \nclaims on the grounds that the complaint fails to adequately allege the conduct underlying those claims occurred in \nTexas.  However, because the undersigned recommends giving the Plaintiffs an opportunity  to amend their \ncomplaint, this report will also address Burnettโs alternate alternative for dismissing the Plaintiffโs state law claims.   \n9 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 64   Filed 08/12/14   Page 10 of 14 PageID #:  779\nPlaintiffs: โ(1) they would be eligible for permanent residency through their employment with \nSignal; (2) Defendants would apply for permanent residency in the United States on behalf of \nPlaintiffs; (3) Defendants would extend Plaintiffsโ H-2B visas while they were being processed \nfor permanent residency; and (4) Plaintiffs would have steady and ongoing work opportunities in \nthe United States with Signal.โ  (Doc. No. 1, p. 72.)  โDefendants  and/or their respective \nagents also made false representations regarding the living conditions at the Texas Labor Camp.โ  \n(Id.)   In reliance on Burnettโs promises, the Plaintiffs: 1) paid large sums of money to Burnett, \nwhich directly benefitted Signal in the form of cheap labor and increased profits; 2) incurred \nsubstantial interest-bearing debts in order to pay recruitment, immigration-related, and travel fees \ncharged by Defendants and their agents, employees and/or representatives; 3) sold personal and \nreal property and surrendered employment opportunities in India, Singapore, and/or the United \nArab Emirates; and 4) left their homes and jobs and India and other countries and traveled to the \nUnited States to work for Defendant Signal.  (Id. pp. 73-74.)  The Plaintiffs further allege \nBurnett knew, or should have known, the Plaintiffs would have induced the Plaintiffs to take \nthese steps.   (Id.)  Given these allegations, the undersigned finds that the Plaintiffs have met \nthe 12(b)(6) pleading standard and recommends denying the Defendantsโ motion to dismiss this \nclaim.   \n  3.   Breach of Contract \n  Burnett generally states the Plaintiffs failed to allege facts to support their breach of \ncontract claim.  (Doc. No. 38, p. 7.)   However, the Plaintiffs allege they entered into valid \ncontracts with Burnett under which they would pay fees to Burnett in exchange for his promise \nto provide them with lawful employment and work-authorized green cards enabling them to \npermanently and legally reside in the United States with their families.  (Doc. No. 1, p. 74.)   \n10 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 64   Filed 08/12/14   Page 11 of 14 PageID #:  780\nBurnett allegedly breached this contract by not fulfilling those promises and refusing to refund \nthe  fees  the  Plaintiffs  paid  him.    (Id.,  p.  7.)    Accordingly,  the  undersigned  recommends \ndenying dismissal of this claim.    \n  4.  Statute of Limitations   \n  The Burnett Defendants also assert that the Plaintiffsโ pendent state law claims are time \nbarred by the statute of limitations.  Burnett argues the statute of limitations on the state law \nclaims began to run, at the latest, a year and a half after each Plaintiffโs arrival because โless than \na year-and-a-half after coming to the Texas Labor Camp, Plaintiffs were either terminated or told \nthey were being sent to work at the Pascagoula, Mississippi facility for lower wages.โ   (Doc. \nNo. 38, p. 13.)   Burnett submits that most of the Plaintiffs arrived in December 2006, while four \narrived February 2007; and, therefore the statute of limitations would have commenced no later \nthan August 2008.  (Id.)  Although Burnett does not catalogue the statute of limitations for \neach pendent state law claim under Texas law, he claims they would expire, at the latest, in four \nyearsโ2012.  The complaint in the instant case was filed in 2013.   Burnett also argues the \nfederal class action filed in the David court, which was not certified, did not toll the running of \nthe statute of limitations on the state law claims.     \n  In response, the Plaintiffs argue the David Court noted in an Order that Burnett consented \nto the tolling of the state-law claims.  (Doc. No. 42, p. 15.)  In the alternative, they argue \nTexas law supports the tolling of the statute of limitations as to all purported members of a class \nupon the filing of the class action.  (Id., p. 16.)    \nThe David complaint was filed on March 7, 2008.  (Doc. No. 37, Exh. 1.)  United \nStates District Judge Jay Zainey, upon the consent of Signal and the Burnett Defendants, entered \nan order tolling the statute of limitations for the absent class membersโ (who are the Plaintiffs in \n11 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 64   Filed 08/12/14   Page 12 of 14 PageID #:  781\nthis case) state law claims for 120 days until after the courtโs final ruling on class certification.  \nOrder, Kurian David et al. v. Signal International, L.L.C., et al., No. 2:08-cv-1220 (E.D. La. Jan. \n20, 2011) (Doc. No. 982).  Judge Zainey entered an order denying class certification on January \n4, 2012, making the expiration of the tolling period May 3, 2012.   Order and Reasons, David, \nNo. 2:08-cv-1220 (Doc. No. 1117).   The case was subsequently transferred to United States \nDistrict Judge Susie Morgan.   Order Reassigning Case, David, No. 2:08-cv-1220 (Doc. No. \n1157).   Over Signalโs objections, Judge Morgan further tolled the statute of limitations for the \nPlaintiffsโ claims until August 28, 2013.  Order and Reasons, David, No. 2:08-cv-1220 (Doc. \nNo. 1379).  However, pursuant to Burnettโs request, Judge Morgan clarified that prior order by \nstating it only tolled the limitations period for the federal law claims, not any state law claims.  \nOrder and Reasons, David, No. 2:08-cv-1220 (Doc. No. 1417). \nFor a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court is  typically not  to  look  beyond  the complaint.  \nHowever, a court may consider attachments to briefing regarding a motion to dismiss if the \ndocuments are referenced in the complaint, central to the complaint, referenced by the parties, \nand their authenticity is not in dispute.   See Walch v. Adjutant Gen. Depโt, 533 F.3d 289, \n293โ94 (5th Cir. 2008) (citing In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. \n2007)); Causey v. Sewell Cadillac-Chevrolet, Inc., 394 F.3d 285, 288 (5th Cir. 2004).  Those \nare the only documents the undersigned should consider in deciding the motion to dismiss as it \nconcerns the limitations issueโnot the various court orders entered by the New Orleans district \ncourts tolling state statutes of limitations for the pendent state law claims.4   \nNevertheless, even if the undersigned were to consider and apply Judge Zaineyโs tolling \n                                         \n  4.  Burnett did not address the tolling orders entered by the David court, and the Plaintiffs only mentioned \nJudge Zaineyโs order, not Judge Morganโs orders.  It should be noted that the briefing on the instant motion \noccurred after all of the David tolling orders had been entered. \n  \n12 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 64   Filed 08/12/14   Page 13 of 14 PageID #:  782\norder from the date the David complaint was filed until its expiration, the undersigned would still \nneed to go outside the pleadings to intelligently determine the appropriate accrual date for the \nvarious state law claims and what effect the tolling period from Judge Zaineyโs order has on the \ntimeliness of the pendent state law claims filed in the instant complaint.5  Pursuant to Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 12(d), โif on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) matters outside the pleadings \nare presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary \njudgment under Rule 56, and all parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present \nmaterial that is pertinent to the motion.โ  Accordingly, to the extent the Burnett Defendants \nbelieve the Plaintiffsโ state law claims are still barred by the statute of limitations in light of \nJudge Zaineyโs tolling order, that is a matter best addressed in a motion for summary judgment, \nafter the parties have had an opportunity for full discovery and the court can consider evidence \noutside the pleadings.         \nV.  Recommendation \n  For the reasons stated above, the Burnett Defendantsโ โMotion to Dismiss Pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)โ (Doc. No. 38) should be granted as to the Plaintiffsโ Ku Klux Klan Act \nclaim  and  state  law  claims  of  negligent  misrepresentation,  fraud  and  breach  of  contract.  \nHowever, the Plaintiffs should be given leave to amend these claims.   See Texas Indigenous \nCouncil, 544 F. Appโx at 421.  Should the Plaintiffs choose to do so, they shall amend the \ncomplaint within seven (7) days of the date in which the district court adopts this report and \nrecommendation  if  applicable.    Id.    The  motion  should  be  denied  as  to  the  other  claims \n                                         \n  5.  Burnett cites Bell v. Showa Denko K.K., 899 S.W.2d 749 (Tex. App.โAmarillo 1995, writ denied) in \nsupport of their argument that Texas courts hold the filing of a proposed federal class action does not toll the \nlimitations period on pendent state law claims.  See also Newby v. Enron Corp., 542 F.3d 463 (5th Cir. 2008).  In \nthose cases, it does not appear the Defendants consented to the tolling of the statute of limitations, as the Burnett \nDefendants did here, at least for the period of time reflected in Judge Zaineyโs order.  As such, those cases appear \nto be inapposite. \n \n13 of 14 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 64   Filed 08/12/14   Page 14 of 14 PageID #:  783\nasserted by the Plaintiffs, subject to reconsideration in a motion for summary judgment that the \nstate law claims are barred by the statute of limitations.   \nVI.  Objections \n  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(c) (Supp. IV 2011), each party to this action has the \nright to file objections to this report and recommendation.  Objections to this report must (1) be \nin writing, (2) specifically identify those findings or recommendations to which the party objects, \nand (3) be served and filed within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this \nreport.   See 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(c); Fed R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2).  A party who objects to this \nreport is entitled to a de novo determination by the United States District Judge of those proposed \nfindings and recommendations to which a specific objection is timely made.   See 28 U.S.C. ยง \n636(b)(1)(c); Fed R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3).    \n  A partyโs failure to file specific, written objections to the proposed findings of fact and \nconclusions of law contained in this report, within fourteen (14) days of being served with a copy \nof this report, bars that party from: (1) entitlement to de novo review by the United States District \nJudge of the findings of fact and conclusions of law, see Rodriguez v. Bowen, 857 F.2d 275, \n276โ77 (5th Cir. 1988), and (2) appellate review, except on grounds of plain error, of any such \nfindings  of  fact  and  conclusions  of  law  accepted  by  the  United  States  District  Judge,  see \nDouglass v. United Servs. Auto. Assโn, 79 F.3d 1415, 1428โ29 (5th Cir. 1996).   \nSIGNED this 12th day of August, 2014.\n_________________________\nZack Hawthorn\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n14 of 14 ",

Because \n \nPage 1 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 58   Filed 07/16/14   Page 2 of 9 PageID #:  716\nthese  motions  and  corresponding  responses  are  for  all  intents  and  purposes  the  same,  the \nundersignedโs decision and reasoning on the motions pending in the instant suit will apply to the \ncorresponding motions filed in Marimuthu and Meganathan as well.  Id.    \n  Having considered the pending motions and the corresponding responses, the court denies \nthe Signal and Burnett Defendantsโ motions to transfer pursuant to the first-to-file rule because \nthere is not a substantial overlap between the instant suit and Kurian David et al. v. Signal, Intโl, \nL.L.C. et al., the first filed suit.  See Civ. A. No. 08-1220 (E.D. La.). \nI.  Background \nA.  Procedural Background \n  On March 7, 2008, twelve individuals who were allegedly trafficked into the United States \nfiled a putative class action against the Defendants in the Eastern District of Louisiana asserting \ntrafficking, RICO, civil rights, and state law contract and fraud claims.1  See David v. Signal Intโl, \nLLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220 (E.D. La.).  That Court denied class certification;2 and, as a result of \nthis ruling, the Plaintiffs in the instant action filed suit in this District, where they were allegedly \nsubjected to deplorable working conditions at a Signal facility in Orange, Texas.3  (Doc. No. 39.)  \nOn August 7, 2013, the Plaintiffs filed their complaint in this court against the Burnett Defendants, \nthe Signal Defendants, Michael Pol, Global Resources, Inc., Sachin Dewan, Dewan Consultants \n                                                 \n  1.  The Plaintiffs presumably still have FLSA claims pending in the Eastern District of Louisiana.  (Doc. \nNo. 21, p. 10.) \n \n  2.  David v. Signal Intโl, LLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. Jan. \n3, 2012). \n \n  3.  Srinivasa Rao Gonna is the only Plaintiff in this lawsuit who worked in Signalโs Pascagoula, Mississippi \nfacility as opposed to their Orange, Texas facility. \n \n \nPage 2 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 58   Filed 07/16/14   Page 3 of 9 PageID #:  717\nPvt. Ltd., Indo-Ameri Soft L.L.C., Kurella Rao, J&M Associates of Mississippi, Inc., J&M Marine \n& Industrial, L.L.C., and Billy R. Wilks.  The Plaintiffs allege that some or all of the Defendants \nviolated the following federal statutes: 1) The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act \nof 2003; 2) Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act; 3) The Civil Rights act of 1866; \nand 4) The Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871.  (Id.)  In addition, the Plaintiffs bring state law fraud, \nnegligent misrepresentation and breach of contract claims against all of the Defendants.  (Id.)   \nB.  Factual Background    \n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, approximately 590 men, including the Plaintiffs, \nwere allegedly trafficked into the United States through the federal governmentโs H-2B guest \nworker program to provide labor and services to the Signal Defendants.  (Doc. No. 39, p. 2.)  The \nPlaintiffs claim they were lured to work for Signal through the fraudulent promise of legal and \npermanent work-based immigration to the United States for themselves and their families.  (Id., p. \n4.)    Subsequently,  after  coming  to  the  United  States,  the  Plaintiffs  were  allegedly  denied \nemployment or were subjected to forced labor and other serious abuses at Signal operations in \nOrange, Texas and Pascagoula, Mississippi.  (Id., p. 5.)   \nII.  Jurisdiction  \n  The Plaintiffs seek recovery pursuant to several federal statutes.  For actions brought \nunder these statutory provisions, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon federal \nquestion jurisdiction.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331; 29 U.S.C. ยง 216(b).  For the state law causes of \naction, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction predicated upon supplemental jurisdiction.  See \n \nPage 3 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 58   Filed 07/16/14   Page 4 of 9 PageID #:  718\n28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(a).  Venue is proper because the events giving rise to the above claims occurred \nwithin the confines of this District.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391.  \nIII.  First to File Rule  \n  The Signal and Burnett Defendants move to transfer the instant case to the Eastern District \nof Louisiana pursuant to the First-Filed Doctrine.  (Doc. Nos. 14, 31.)  โUnder the first-to-file \nrule, when related cases are pending before two federal courts, the court in which the case was last \nfiled may refuse to hear it if the issues raised by the cases substantially overlap.โ  Intโl Fid. Ins. \nCo. v. Sweet Little Mexico Corp., 665 F.3d 671, 677 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting Cadle Co. v. \nWhataburger of Alice, Inc., 174 F.3d 599, 603 (5th Cir. 1999)).  โThe first-to-file rule is a \ndiscretionary doctrine.โ Jones v. Xerox Commercial Solutions, LLC, CIV. A. No. H-13-0650, \n2013 WL 3245957, at *2 (S.D. Tex. June 26, 2013) (quoting Cadle Co., 174 F.3d at 603).  The \nrule is utilized โto avoid the waste of duplication, to avoid rulings which may trench upon the \nauthority of sister courts, and to avoid piecemeal resolution of issues that call for a uniform result.โ  \nSave Power Ltd. v. Syntek Fin. Corp., 121 F.3d 947, 950 (5th Cir. 1997).  The party wishing to \ntransfer the case has the burden to prove that transfer is warranted.  Jones, 2013 WL 3245957, at \n*2 (citing SanofiโAventis Deutschland GmbH v. Novo Nordisk, Inc., 614 F. Supp. 2d 772, 777 n. \n5 (E.D. Tex. 2009); VCode Holdings, Inc. v. Cognex Corp., No. 2:07โcvโ138, 2007 WL 2238054, \nat *2 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 3, 2007); Buckalew v. Celanese, LTD., No. Gโ05โ315, 2005 WL 2266619, \nat *1 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 16, 2005)).   \n  โIn deciding whether to apply the first-to-file rule, the Court must resolve two questions: \n(1) are the two pending actions so duplicative or do they involve such substantially similar issues \n \nPage 4 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 58   Filed 07/16/14   Page 5 of 9 PageID #:  719\nthat one court should decide the subject matter of both actions, and if so, (2) which of the two \ncourts should take the case.โ  Datamize, Inc. v. Fid. Brokerage Servs., LLC, 2:03-CV-321-DF, \n2004  WL  1683171,  at  *3  (E.D.  Tex.  Apr.  22,  2004)  (citing  Texas  Instruments  v.  Micron \nSemiconductor, 815 F. Supp. 994, 997 (E.D. Tex. 1993)).  โThe first-to-file rule does not require \nthat cases be identical, but merely that there is a substantial overlap in issues and parties.โ  White \nv. Peco Foods, Inc., 546 F. Supp. 2d 339, 342 (S.D. Miss. 2008).   \nIV.  Analysis \n  The Defendants argue there is substantial overlap between the instant case and the first \nfiled case, David.  (Doc. Nos. 14, 31.)  While there are similarities in the two cases, the \nundersigned finds that the two cases do not involve such substantially similar parties and issues \nthat one court should decide the subject matter of both actions. \nA.  Parties \n  There is some overlap between the parties in David and the instant case, but it is not \nsubstantial.  While all of the Plaintiffs in the instant suit are also plaintiffs in David, as explained \nbelow, they are only asserting FLSA claims in David, which they do not assert here.4  (Doc. No. \n21, p. 10.)  Conversely, none of the David plaintiffs asserting non-FLSA claims are parties in the \ninstant case.  (Id., p. 8)  The David defendants and the Defendants in this suit are not completely \nidentical, but for purposes of this analysis, the court finds that the difference is insignificant.  \nWhile the first-to-file rule does not require identical parties, see Save Power Ltd., 121 F.3d at 950, \n                                                 \n4.  Even if the Plaintiffs in this case were at one point putative class members in the David class action \nlitigation, they were never parties since the class was never certified.  See Smith v. Bayer Corp., 131 S. Ct. 2368, \n2379 (2011) (holding that it is erroneous to believe a nonnamed class member is a party to class action litigation before \nthe class is certified, or if certification is ultimately denied). \n \n \nPage 5 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 58   Filed 07/16/14   Page 6 of 9 PageID #:  720\nโthe fact that the parties are different cuts against an argument for substantial overlap.โ  Jones, \n2013 WL 3245957, at *4.  \nB.  Claims \n  Although the first-to-file rule also does not require the issues to completely overlap, โthe \ncases should be more than merely related to support a motion to transfer when venue is otherwise \nappropriate.โ  Buckalew v. Celanese, Ltd., CIV. A. No. G-05-315, 2005 WL 2266619, at *2 (S.D. \nTex. Sept. 16, 2005).  The instant suit and David are related to the extent that all of the claims \nasserted in this suit are also asserted by the different David Plaintiffs.  However, there is not \nsubstantial overlap among the claims in both suits.  As the District Court established in its opinion \ndenying the Plaintiffsโ Motion for Class Certification in David, each of the Plaintiffsโ claims \nrequire individualized proof as it pertains to that particular Plaintiff.  David v. Signal Intโl, LLC, \nCiv. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. Jan. 3, 2012).  Thus, not \nonly are each of the individual plaintiffsโ forced labor, trafficking, RICO and civil rights claims \ndifferent from one another in this suit, as explained below, they are entirely different from their \npending FLSA claims in David.  Therefore, the issues presented by the Plaintiffs here cannot be \nresolved in the David suit.  W. Gulf Mar. Assโn v. ILA Deep Sea Local 24, S. Atl. & Gulf Coast \nDist. of ILA, AFL-CIO, 751 F.2d 721, 729 (5th Cir. 1985) (โ. . . a district court may dismiss an \naction where the issues presented can be resolved in an earlier-filed action pending in another \ndistrict court.โ).  \n \nPage 6 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 58   Filed 07/16/14   Page 7 of 9 PageID #:  721\n  1.  Forced Labor and Trafficking \n  The  success  of  each  Plaintiffโs  forced  labor  and  trafficking  claims  is  dependent  on \nindividualized factors.  The question in a forced labor case is โwhether Defendantsโ coercive \nconduct was such that it could overcome the will of the victim so as to make him render his labor \ninvoluntary.โ  David, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247 at 77.  โThis question cannot be answered \nvia  generalized  class-wide  proof  but  rather  must  be  answered  individually  based  upon \nindividualized proof.โ  Id.  Similarly, with trafficking, โindividual issues will play a significant \npartโ because involuntary servitude is an essential element of the claim.  Id. at 80-81.   \n  2.  RICO Claims \n  The success of each Plaintiffโs RICO claim is also based on each individualโs experience \nbecause the Plaintiff will be โrequired to prove that the [Defendants] committed the predicate acts \nupon which they rely for the pattern of racketeering activity.โ  Id. at 92.  As stated above, proof \nof the predicate acts of trafficking and forced labor are โall premised on coercionโ and โcannot be \nmade without resort to individualized proof.โ  Id.  Additionally, in order to prove the fraud-based \npredicate acts, each Plaintiff will โhave to prove first-party reliance on the alleged fraud that was \ndirected at them,โ because โthe question of individual reliance [is] paramount to resolving whether \nPlaintiffsโ injuries were caused by a RICO violation.โ  Id. at 105-06. \n  3.  Civil Rights Claims \n  The Plaintiffs are suing the Signal Defendants under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981 for violating their \nrights to โenjoy and benefit from non-discriminatory employment relationshipsโ with the Signal \nDefendants.  (Doc. No. 39, p. 62.)  In order to obtain compensatory damages under this claim, as \n \nPage 7 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 58   Filed 07/16/14   Page 8 of 9 PageID #:  722\nsought by the Plaintiffs, each โPlaintiff must prove actual injury to himself and that injury must be \nattributable to (caused by) the Defendantโs disparate treatment.โ  David, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n114247, at *119.  For this reason, the outcome of each Plaintiffโs case will vary based on their \nindividualized experience. \n  4.  Violations of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 \n  The Plaintiffs allege that the Burnett Defendants violated the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1971 by \nviolating their right to be free from โforced labor, involuntary servitude, and trafficking in \npersons.โ  (Doc. No. 39, p. 64.)  Forced labor, involuntary servitude, and trafficking all include \nan element of coercion, which requires an individualized analysis of each Plaintiffโs situation, as \nstated above.  David, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *128.   \n  As one can easily discern, none of the above causes of action involve substantially similar \nissues to the Plaintiffsโ FLSA claims pending in David, which include claims of violating the \nfederally mandated minimum wage laws.  The proof required for the FLSA claims and the \nremedies sought are distinct from the proof and remedies at issue in the instant matter.  Given that \nthere is not a substantial overlap of the claims between the David litigation and this case, and with \nthe exception of the Plaintiffsโ FLSA claims in David, none of the Plaintiffs in the instant suit and \nDavid overlap, the courtโs denial of the Burnett Defendantsโ motion to transfer will not result in \nโpiecemeal resolution of issues that call for a uniform result.โ  Save Power Ltd. v. Syntek Fin. \nCorp., 121 F.3d 947, 950 (5th Cir. 1997).   \n \nPage 8 of 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 58   Filed 07/16/14   Page 9 of 9 PageID #:  723\nV.  Conclusion \n \n  The court finds that the instant suit does not substantially overlap with the first-filed suit, \nDavid.  Accordingly, the Signal Defendantsโ โMotion for Stay Pendente Lite and for Transfer \nPursuant to First Filed Ruleโ (Doc. No. 14), and the Burnett Defendantsโ โMotion to Transfer \nVenue and Memorandum in Supportโ (Doc. No. 31) are DENIED.  As discussed previously, \nthese same motions filed in related casesโMarimuthu et. al v. Signal International L.L.C. et al., \n1:13-cv-499  (Doc.  Nos.  23,  36);  Meganathan  et  al.  v.  Signal  International  L.L.C.  et  al., \n1:13-cv-497 (Doc. Nos. 17, 12)โare also DENIED for the same reasons.   \n \nSIGNED this 16th day of July, 2014.\n   \n__________________________________________________\nZaacckk HHaawwtthhoorrnn\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n \nPage 9 of 9 \n \n ",

' \n  '     \nv.   '    NO. 1:13-CV-499 \n  '     \nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL L.L.C., et al.  ' \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON BURNETTโS \nMOTION TO DISMISS (DOC. NO. 77) \n \nThis case is assigned to the Honorable Marcia A. Crone, United States District Judge, and \nis referred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge for all pretrial matters.  (Doc. No. \n4.)  Pending before the undersigned is the โMotion to Dismiss Pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. \n12(b)(6)โ (Doc. No. 77) filed by Malvern C. Burnett, the Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, \nA.P.C., and the Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, L.L.C. (collectively, โBurnettโ).   Burnett \nseeks dismissal of the Plaintiffsโ Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 (โKKKAโ) and state-law claims.  \nThe undersigned, after considering Burnettโs motion, the Plaintiffsโ response (Doc. No. 79), the \namended complaint (Doc. No. 76), and applicable authorities, finds that the Plaintiffs have \nadequately pled their KKKA and state-law claims.   Accordingly, the undersigned recommends \nthat Burnettโs motion be denied.    \nI. Background \nIn  the  aftermath  of  Hurricane  Katrina,  approximately  590  men,  including  the  ten \nPlaintiffs in this case, were allegedly trafficked into the United States to provide labor for \nSignalโs operations.  (Doc. No. 76, pp. 1โ8.)   The Plaintiffs claim that the Defendants made \nโfalse promises of assistance in applying for and obtaining permanent residence in the United \nStates,โ as well as โbilked Plaintiffs out of tens of thousands of dollars in โrecruitment feesโ (for \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 126   Filed 02/27/15   Page 2 of 10 PageID #:  3452\nwhich Plaintiffs assumed massive debts) . . . [and] forced them to live in squalid conditions in a \ngated, guarded, isolated labor camp . . . .โ   (Id. at p. 2.)   \nA putative class action was filed in the Eastern District of Louisiana on behalf of all the \nworkers who had allegedly been trafficked to the United States to work at Signalโs facilities in \nTexas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.   (See Doc. 1, David v. Signal Intโl, L.L.C., 2:08-cv-1220 \n(March 7, 2008)).  The court in David denied class certification, which caused the individual \nclass members to file suit where their alleged injuries occurred.   See David v. Signal Intโl, \nL.L.C., No 08-1220, 2012 WL 10759668, at *37 (E.D. La. Jan. 4, 2012).  The Plaintiffs in this \ncase worked at Signalโs facility in Orange, Texas, which is within this judicial district.  \nThe  Plaintiffs  are  suing  Burnett,  as  well  as  Signal  International  L.L.C.,  Signal \nInternational, Inc., Signal International Texas, G.P., Signal International Texas, L.P., Global \nResources, Inc., Sachin Dewan, and Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd. (a/k/a Medtech Consultants).  \nThe Plaintiffs allege that some or all of the Defendants violated the following federal statutes: (1) \nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003; (2) the Civil Rights Act of \n1866; and (3) the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871.  (Doc. No. 76, pp. 71โ77.)   In addition, the \nPlaintiffs assert causes of action for state-law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of \ncontract against all of the Defendants.   (Id.)   \nOn February 22, 2014, Burnett moved to dismiss all of the Plaintiffsโ claims, arguing that \nthey had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.   (Doc. No. 38.)  The \nundersigned recommended granting Burnettโs motion in part.  (Doc. No. 64.)  Specifically, the \nundersigned found that there were insufficient factual allegations to support a claim under the \nKKKA, and that the Plaintiffsโ state-law claims were deficient, but that the remainder of the \nPlaintiffsโ claims were adequately pled.   (Id.)    The undersigned also recommended that the \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 126   Filed 02/27/15   Page 3 of 10 PageID #:  3453\nPlaintiffs be given an opportunity to amend their complaint.  The District Court adopted the \nundersignedโs  recommendations.    (Doc.  No.  69.)    The  Plaintiffs  then  filed  an  amended \ncomplaint, and Burnett again sought to dismiss the Plaintiffsโ KKKA and state-law claims.      \nII. Rule 12(b)(6) Standard \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) authorizes dismissal of a complaint that fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted.   A Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss โis viewed \nwith disfavor and is rarely granted.โ   Harrington v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 563 F.3d 141, \n147  (5th  Cir.  2009).    When  a  court  analyzes  a  Rule  12(b)(6)  motion,  it  โaccepts  โall \nwell-pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.โโ   In re \nKatrina Canal Breaches Litig., 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Martin K. Eby Constr. \nCo. v. Dall. Area Rapid Transit, 369 F.3d 464, 467 (5th Cir. 2004)).  A court should grant such \na motion only when the complaint fails to contain โenough facts to state a claim to relief that is \nplausible on its face.โ   Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim is \nplausible on its face โwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the \nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.โ   Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  โThreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported \nby mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.โ   Id. \nIII. Analysis \nBurnett seeks to dismiss the Plaintiffsโ KKKA and state-law claims.1  Burnett argues that \nthe Plaintiffsโ KKKA claim should be dismissed because they failed to plead any facts showing \nthat there was a conspiracy or that Burnett was motivated by racial animus.  As to the Plaintiffsโ \n                                                 \n1.  Burnett, โso as to not be deemed to have waived his assertions that Plaintiffs have failed to state a \ncause of action on which relief can be based . . . reaffirms and reasserts that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for \nhuman trafficking against him upon which relief can be granted.โ  (Doc. No. 77, p. 2.)  However, having already \nfound that the Plaintiffs stated a claim for human trafficking, the focus of Burnettโs current motion is only the claims \nthat were previously dismissed.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 126   Filed 02/27/15   Page 4 of 10 PageID #:  3454\nstate-law claims, Burnett claims that dismissal is warranted because the Plaintiffsโ amended \ncomplaint again fails to demonstrate that the conduct supporting the state-law claims occurred in \nTexas.   Burnett also reasserts that the Plaintiffsโ state-law claims are barred by the statute of \nlimitations.   \nA.  Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. ยง 1985(3)) \nโTo state a claim under ยง1985(3), [the plaintiff] must allege that two or more persons \nconspired directly, or indirectly, to deprive him of the equal protection of the laws or equal \nprivileges and immunities under the laws.โ   Green v. State Bar of Tex., 27 F.3d 1083, 1089 (5th \nCir. 1994).   In addition, โ[t]he language requiring intent to deprive of equal protection, or equal \nprivileges  and  immunities,  means  that  there  must  be  some  racial,  or  perhaps  otherwise \nclass-based,  invidiously  discriminatory  animus  behind  the  conspiratorsโ  action.โ    Griffin  v. \nBreckenridge, 403 U.S. 88, 102 (1971).   Burnett argues that the Plaintiffs have failed to plead \nfacts showing that there was a conspiracy or that there was any racial animus.   \nFirst, Burnett claims that the Plaintiffs have โnot pled any facts that support a conclusion \nthat [he] conspired with any other Defendants to deprive these Plaintiffs of their right to be free \nfrom involuntary servitude.โ  (Doc. No. 77, pp. 6โ7.)  โFifth Circuit precedent [holds] that \nspecific facts must be pled when a conspiracy is alleged; mere conclusory allegations will not \nsuffice.   In pleading these specific facts, the Plaintiff must allege the operative facts of the \nalleged conspiracy.โ   Williams v. Thompson, No. 5:11-cv-68, 2012 WL 651650, at *11 (E.D. \nTex. Jan 26, 2012) (Craven, Mag. J.) (discussing the sufficiency of a KKKA claim).  Here, the \nPlaintiffs have put forth sufficient facts to plead a plausible claim of conspiracy.   For example, \nthe  Plaintiffs  allege  that  there  were  contractual  relationships  between  Burnett  and  his \nco-conspirators, and that Burnett had attorney-client relationships with several of the Defendants.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 126   Filed 02/27/15   Page 5 of 10 PageID #:  3455\n(See Doc. No. 79) (discussing examples of Burnettโs relationships that are further detailed in the \namended complaint).  Moreover, the Plaintiffs allege that Burnett played an integral role in the \noverall conspiracy to bring the Plaintiffs to the United States and keep them in a condition of \ninvoluntary servitude by processing the Plaintiffsโ immigration related documents while at the \nsame time supposedly knowing of the allegedly false promises made by his co-conspirators.  \n(Doc. No. 76, pp. 24โ26.)   These factual allegations are sufficient to create a plausible claim \nthat all the Defendants were working in concert to further the goals of the conspiracy. \nNot every conspiracy, however, is actionable under the KKKA.  Rather, the KKKA only \nreaches conspiracies that deprive another of certain rights.  See Bray v. Alexandria Womenโs \nHealth Clinic, 506 U.S. 263, 278 (1993).  The right at issue in this case is the right to be free \nfrom involuntary servitude.   Burnett claims that the only fact pled showing that there was a \nconspiracy to deprive the Plaintiffs of the right to be from involuntary servitude is the allegation \nthat Burnett was present at a meeting where the Plaintiffs were threatened with deportation.  \nThreats of deportation have been held to support a claim of involuntary servitude.  Kiwanuka v. \nBakilana, 844 F. Supp. 2d 107, 115 (D.D.C. 2012) (collecting cases).   While Burnett denies \nbeing at this meeting, that is a fact issue that is not proper for resolution on a motion to dismiss.  \nThe allegation that Burnett was a participant is sufficient to tie Burnett to the conspiracy to \ndeprive the Plaintiffs of their right to be free from involuntary servitude.  Accordingly, after \ntaking all the facts in the Plaintiffsโ amended complaint as true, it is plausible that Burnett was \npart of a conspiracy in violation of the KKKA.   \nAs to whether the Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged racial animus, Burnett argues that \nthe Plaintiffsโ โAmended Complaint did not change or add anything new or different from their \noriginal Complaint, which this Court determined failed to plead facts in support of its conclusory \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 126   Filed 02/27/15   Page 6 of 10 PageID #:  3456\nallegations.โ  (Doc. No. 77, p. 4.)  Burnett points to paragraph 396 of the Plaintiffsโ amended \ncomplaint as support.   While this paragraph of the Plaintiffsโ amended complaint is identical to \none in their original complaint, Burnett overlooks the numerous new factual allegations in the \nprior paragraphs of the Plaintiffsโ amended complaint that supports their claim of racial animus.  \n(See  Doc.  No.  79,  p.  10)  (noting  that  the  amended  complaint  contains  โno  less  than  23 \namendments relating to racial and anti-immigrant animus . . .โ).   In sum, the Plaintiffs allege \nthat Burnett actively worked against their interests, that he did so because they were Indian, and \neven go so far as to include certain racist comments made by Burnett, which supports an \ninference that he was motived by racial animus.  This is enough to move the Plaintiffsโ claim \nfrom โpossibleโ to โplausible.โ   Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (โThe plausibility standard is not akin to \na โprobability requirement,โ but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has \nacted  unlawfully.    Where  a  complaint  pleads  facts  that  are  โmerely  consistent  withโ  a \ndefendantโs liability, it โstops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement \nto relief.โโ) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). \nBurnett also argues that the mere fact that the Plaintiffs were all of Indian descent does \nnot โdemonstrate or support any โanti-Indianโ animus on the part of Burnett.โ  (Doc. No. 77, p. \n6) (claiming that Indian workers were recruited because โIndia was believed to have a large pool \nof skilled workersโ).   In some respects, Burnett is correct.   The mere fact that the workers \nrecruited by the Defendants were all of Indian descent does not necessarily lead to a conclusion \nthat there was racial animus.  See e.g., United States v. Calimlim, 538 F.3d 706, 711 (7th Cir. \n2008) (โObtaining the services of another person is not itself illegal; it is only illegal when \naccompanied by one of the three given circumstances [in 18 U.S.C. ยง1589], and the jury must \nfind  that  the  defendant  knew  that  the  circumstance  existed.โ).    But,  the  numerous  factual \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 126   Filed 02/27/15   Page 7 of 10 PageID #:  3457\nallegations concerning the conditions the Plaintiffs faced upon arrival to the United States, \ncoupled with the fact that the Plaintiffs argue that only the Indian workers were treated in this \nmanner, makes it plausible that that both Burnett, as well as the conspiracy as a whole, were \nmotived by racial animus.  For instance, the complaint alleges that that only the Indian workers \nwere forced to live in the โman camps,โ that the Indian workers were โsubjected to different, less \nfavorable employment conditionsโ and generallyโas a classโthe Indian workers were subject \nto improper treatment.   (See Doc. No. 76, pp. 4โ7.)  The disparate treatment of a racially \nidentifiable class of people creates a plausible claim of racial animus.    \nIn addition, Burnettโs attempts to analogize the facts of this case to those of Iqbal are \nunavailing.  (Doc. No. 77, pp 4โ5.)   In Iqbal, at issue was a policy of seeking out potential \nterrorists in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.   Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 682.   The Supreme Court noted \nthat โ[i]t should come as no surprise that a legitimate policy directing law enforcement to arrest \nand detain individuals because of their suspected link to the attacks would produce a disparate, \nincidental impact on Arab Muslims, even though the purpose of the policy was to target neither \nArabs or Muslims.โ   Id.   The Court went on to reason: โAs between that โobvious alternative \nexplanationโ for the arrests, and the purposeful, invidious discrimination respondent asks us to \ninfer, discrimination is not a plausible conclusion.โ   Id.  The facts of this case, however, do not \nalign with the Courtโs reasoning in Iqbal.  Here, there was a deliberate attempt to seek out \nworkers of Indian descent, whereas in Iqbal, the fact that one racial group was targeted was \nmerely a consequence of a racially neutral policy.   Moreover, what further distinguishes the \nPlaintiffsโ allegations from those in Iqbal is that the Plaintiffs have alleged numerous specific \nways in which they were treated differently because of their membership in a racially defined \nclass.    Compare  id.  (โ[T]he  complaint  does  not  show,  or  even  intimate,  that  petitioners \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 126   Filed 02/27/15   Page 8 of 10 PageID #:  3458\npurposefully housed detainees in ADMAX SHU due to their race, religion or nation origin.โ).  \nBecause the Plaintiffs have pled that they were treated differently because of their membership in \na certain class, and offered specific instances, they have โnudged their claims across the line \nfrom conceivable to plausible . . . .โ  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570.  \nB.  State-law claims \nIn a prior order, the undersigned recommended that the Plaintiffsโ state-law claims be \ndismissed because โit was unclear if any of Burnettโs alleged conduct used to support the claims \noccurred  in  Texas.โ    (Doc.  No.  64,  p.  9.)   The  Plaintiffsโ  amended  complaint  adds  new \nallegations attempting to show how Burnettโs conduct, in Texas, damaged them.   (Doc. No. 79, \npp. 4โ5) (discussing the โadditional allegations related to acts and omissions by Burnett in \nTexasโ).  Burnett argues that while the Plaintiffs have alleged facts showing that their breach of \ncontract claim contains a choice of law clause implicating either Mississippi or Indian law, \nPlaintiffs have made no showing that Texas law applies.  (Doc. No. 77, p. 9.)  Moreover, \nBurnett arguesโwithout undertaking a comprehensive choice of law analysisโthat Indian law \napplies to the remainder of the Plaintiffs claims, and therefore, because Texas law applies to \nnone of the Plaintiffsโ state-law claims, they should all be dismissed.  (Id. at pp. 10โ11.) \nBurnettโs motion should be denied for two reasons.   First, the parties miss a critical \npointโthe Plaintiffs have adequately alleged at least one federal cause of action, therefore, this \ncourt has supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims regardless of what law applies to \neach individual claim.2  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367.  Second, in the Plaintiffsโ amended complaint, \nthey now clearly allege that their claims are โrecognized under the laws of Texas, Mississippi, \nand India.โ  (Doc. No. 76, pp. 79โ80.)  The Plaintiffsโ original complaint contained no such \nindication, so it was unclear precisely what substantive law governed their claims.   By clearly \n                                                 \n2.  This point was not raised in the partiesโ initial briefing. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 126   Filed 02/27/15   Page 9 of 10 PageID #:  3459\nstating that their claims are recognized under Texas, Mississippi, or Indian law, the Plaintiffs \nhave adequately pled their state-law causes of action.   See McGee v. Arkel Intโl L.L.C., 671 \nF.3d 539, 543 (5th Cir. 2012) (holding that Iraqi law applied to the plaintiffโs tort claim).    \n  Burnett also argues that the Plaintiffsโ claims are barred by the statute of limitations.  \nThe undersigned addressed this argument in its previous order, noting that โto the extent the \nBurnett Defendants believe the Plaintiffsโ state law claims are still barred by the statute of \nlimitations in light of Judge Zaineyโs tolling order, that is a matter best addressed in a motion for \nsummary judgment, after the parties have had an opportunity for full discovery and the court can \nconsider evidence outside the pleadings.โ   (Doc. No. 64.)  Burnett has pointed to no new or \ndifferent information persuading the undersigned that a determination on tolling can be made \nwithout considering extrinsic evidence.  Accordingly, such an issue is still better addressed in a \nmotion for summary judgment. \nVI. Recommendation \n  For the reasons stated above, the undersigned recommends that Burnettโs โMotion to \nDismiss Pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6)โ (Doc. No. 77) should be denied. \nV. Objections \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(c) (Supp. IV 2011), each party to this action has the \nright to file objections to this report and recommendation.  Objections to this report must (1) be \nin writing, (2) specifically identify those findings or recommendations to which the party objects, \n(3) be served and filed within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this report, \nand (4) be no more than eight pages in length.   See 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(c); FED R. CIV. P. \n72(b)(2); LOCAL RULE CV-72(c).  A party who objects to this report is entitled to a de novo \ndetermination  by  the  United  States  District  Judge  of  those  proposed  findings  and \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 126   Filed 02/27/15   Page 10 of 10 PageID #:  3460\nrecommendations to which a specific objection is timely made.   See 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(c); \nFED R. CIV. P. 72(b)(3).     \n  A partyโs failure to file specific, written objections to the proposed findings of fact and \nconclusions of law contained in this report, within fourteen days of being served with a copy of \nthis report, bars that party from: (1) entitlement to de novo review by the United States District \nJudge of the findings of fact and conclusions of law, see Rodriguez v.

In re Signal Intโl, Inc, et \nal., No. 15-11498 (Bankr. D. Del. July 12, 2015) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 155   Filed 07/03/19   Page 2 of 5 PageID #:  3681\nDistrict of Delaware (the โBankruptcy Courtโ).1  On November 24, 2015, the Bankruptcy Court \nentered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Confirming Debtorsโ First Amended \nJoint Plan of Liquidation Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code [ECF No. 555] (the \nโConfirmation Orderโ), confirming the Signal Entitiesโ plan of liquidation, which implemented \nthe plan support agreement among the Plaintiffs, the Signal Entities and certain other parties, for \nthe settlement of, inter alia, the Plaintiffsโ claims against the relevant Signal Entities.  Pursuant to \nthe Plan, a litigation trust (the โSignal Litigation Trustโ) has been created for the distribution of \nthe settlement proceeds.  That process remains ongoing, as the Signal Litigation Trust distributed \nTrust Claim Forms in February 2015 and the Plaintiffs received 60 days from the distribution date \nto submit their claim forms, which deadline was subsequently extended through June 15, 2016.2   \n                                                 \n1   The other entities are: Signal Ship Repair, LLC (Case No. 15-11499), Signal Intโl, LLC \n(Case No. 15-11500), Signal Intโl Texas GP, LLC (Case No. 15-11501), and Signal Intโl Texas, \nL.P. (Case No. 15-11502).  By the Bankruptcy Courtโs order, all five cases are being jointly \nadministered with the Signal Intโl, Inc. case.  In re Signal Intโl, Inc., No. 15-11498 (Bankr. D. Del. \nJuly 14, 2015), ECF No. 55. \n \n2   With respect to the claims against the Burnett Defendants, nine of the ten Plaintiffs have \nreached a settlement with the Burnett Defendants.  The Burnett Defendants have satisfied their \nobligations under the settlement agreement and the nine participating Plaintiffs expect to dismiss \ntheir claims against the Burnett Defendants in the near future. \n   \n  The lone Plaintiff that is not participating in the settlement with the Burnett Defendants is \nVenkata Satya Sivagi Rao Talabathulla.  Plaintiffsโ counsel has been unable to locate Plaintiff \nVenkata Satya Sivagi Rao Talabathulla to obtain his consent to settle.  In the related cases against \nSignal International, LLC, consolidated in the Eastern District of Louisiana under case number \n2:14-cv-02911-SM-DEK, Samuel et al. v. Signal International, LLC et al., Judge Morgan entered \nan  order  on  August  5,  2016,  requiring  Plaintiff  Venkata  Satya  Sivagi  Rao  Talabathulla  to \ncommunicate with counsel within sixty days of the order.  Plaintiff Venkata Satya Sivagi Rao \nTalabathulla  did  not  communicate  with  counsel  and  Judge  Morgan  entered  a  judgment  on \nDecember 29, 2016, dismissing with prejudice all pending claims he had against the Dewan \nDefendants.  Plaintiffsโ counsel intends to file a motion to withdraw as counsel for Plaintiff \nVenkata Satya Sivagi Rao Talabathulla. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 155   Filed 07/03/19   Page 3 of 5 PageID #:  3682\nCounsel for the Plaintiffs has recently been informed by the Trustee that the party whose \npayments on a certain not were to fund the Trust, is in default, and that the Trustee intended to ask \nthe bankruptcy court for permission to liquidate the note in a sale to one of three bidders.  The \nTrustee has informed counsel that this proposed liquidation will likely result in payouts somewhat \nlower than originally anticipated, but to be made at an earlier date than if the note had been paid \nover its full term.  On October 30, 2018, the Trustee filed its Rule 9019 Motion for Approval of a \nCompromise and Settlement with the Bankruptcy Court, seeking the entry of an order approving \nthe compromise proposal.  Objections, if any, to the compromise proposal were due by November \n29, 2018, under an extension from the Court [Bankr. Docket No. 870].  A Certificate was filed by \nthe Litigation Settlement Trustee certifying there were no objections to the Motion [Bankr. Docket \nNo. 872].  Accordingly, a hearing was held in the Bankruptcy Court on December 4, 2018, and \nthere being no objections to the motion, the Court entered its Order granting the motion for \napproval of the Compromise and Settlement [Bankr. Docket No. 873]. \nThe Plan became effective on December 14, 2015.  As of that date, pursuant to the \nConfirmation Order, โany suit, legal action, or other proceeding โฆ in any forum in the United \nStates that is released, stayed, or enjoined pursuant to Article XI of the Plan against or affecting \nany Released Party [the Signal Entities], shall be stayed, enjoined or otherwise prohibited from \ncontinuation as to any Released Party.โ  (Confirmation Order at 25.)   \nOn February 5, 2019, the Signal bankruptcy proceeding was closed in accordance with the \nconfirmed plan [Bankr. Docket No. 883].  Part of that confirmed plan is for the Signal Litigation \nTrust to distribute proceeds to the Plaintiffs in this action, and others similarly situated.  Those \nproceeds have not yet been distributed.  Because of the termination of the bankruptcy case, the \nautomatic stay is no longer in effect.  Counsel for the Plaintiffs will review the relevant settlement \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 155   Filed 07/03/19   Page 4 of 5 PageID #:  3683\nagreements and court orders and determine if the appropriate course in this action at this time is \ndismissal, or some other procedural step seeking to preserve the jurisdiction of the Court until the \nsettlement proceeds are distributed. \nWith respect to the claims against Malvern C. Burnett, Gulf Coast Immigration Law \nCenter,  L.L.C.,  and  Law  Offices  of  Malvern  C.  Burnett,  A.P.C.  (together,  the  โBurnett \nDefendantsโ), the Plaintiffs have reached a settlement with the Burnett Defendants.  The Burnett \nDefendants have satisfied their obligations under the agreement and, after coordinating with the \nplaintiffs in the related actions, the Plaintiffs will be dismissing their claims against the Burnett \nDefendants in the near future. \nWith respect to the claims against Sachin Dewan and Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd. (a/k/a \nMedtech Consultants) (together, the โDewan Defendantsโ), the Plaintiffs have reached a settlement \nwith the Dewan Defendants.  The Plaintiffs have been informed that the Dewan Defendants have \nsatisfied their obligations under the agreement, and after coordinating with plaintiffs in related \nactions, the Plaintiffs expect to dismiss the claims against the Dewan Defendants in the near future. \nIn light of the delay in distribution from the Signal Litigation Trust and the coordination \nneeded to dismiss the claims against the Burnett Defendants and Dewan Defendants, the Plaintiffs \nrespectfully request that the stay remain in effect for a further 120 days.   The Plaintiffs will file a \nfurther status update in 120 days. \n \nDate: July 3, 2019  By:    /s/Eric H. Findlay___ \nEric H. Findlay \nState Bar. No. 00789886 \nWalter W.

' \n  '     \nv.   '    NO. 1:13-CV-499 \n  '     \nSIGNAL INTERNATIONAL L.L.C. et al  ' \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE \n \n     This case is assigned to the Honorable Marcia Crone, United States District Judge, and is \nreferred to the undersigned United States Magistrate Judge for all pretrial matters.   Pending \nbefore the undersigned is the โMotion and Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss \npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2)โ filed by Malvern C. Burnett, the Law Offices of Malvern C. \nBurnett,  A.P.C.,  and  Gulf  Coast  Immigration  Law  Center,  L.L.C.  (hereinafter  referred  to \ninterchangeably as โBurnettโ and โthe Burnett Defendantsโ).  (Doc. No. 36.)  The undersigned \nhas considered the pending motion and the corresponding response (Doc. No. 43).  The Burnett \nDefendantsโ motion should be denied because the court has specific personal jurisdiction over \nthe Defendants given the number of alleged tortious acts committed by the Defendants that \ninjured the Plaintiffs within Texas.    \nI.  Background \nA.  Procedural Background \n  On March 7, 2008, twelve individuals who were allegedly trafficked into the United \nStates filed a putative class action against the Defendants in the Eastern District of Louisiana \nasserting trafficking, RICO, civil rights, and state law contract and fraud claims.  See David v. \nSignal Intโl, LLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220 (E.D. La.).  That Court denied class certification;1 and, \n                                                 \n  1.  David v. Signal Intโl, LLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. \nJan. 3, 2012). \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 61   Filed 08/01/14   Page 2 of 10 PageID #:  745\nas a result of this ruling, the Plaintiffs in the instant action filed suit in this District, where they \nwere allegedly subjected to deplorable working conditions at a Signal facility in Orange, Texas.  \n(Doc. No. 1.)  On August 7, 2013, the Plaintiffs filed their original complaint in this court \nagainst the following Defendants: Burnett, Signal International, L.L.C., Signal International, \nInc., Signal International Texas, G.P., Signal International Texas, L.P. (hereinafter referred to as \nโSignalโ), Global Resources, Inc., Sachin Dewan, and Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd.   \nB.  Factual Background     \n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, approximately 590 men, including the Plaintiffs, \nwere allegedly trafficked into the United States through the federal governmentโs H-2B guest \nworker program to provide labor and services to the Signal Defendants.   (Doc. No. 1.)  The \nPlaintiffs claim they were lured to work for Signal through the fraudulent promise of legal and \npermanent work-based immigration to the United States for themselves and their families.  (Id., \np. 4.)  Subsequently, after coming to the United States, the Plaintiffs were allegedly subjected to \nforced labor and other serious abuses at Signal operations in Orange, Texas.  (Id.)    \n  The Burnett Defendants consist of Malvern C. Burnett and his two corporations: Gulf \nCoast Immigration Law Center, L.L.C. and Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C.  The \nPlaintiffs  accuse  Burnett  of  conspiring  with  Signal  and  other  Defendants  to  recruit  Indian \nwelders and pipefitters to fill anticipated H-2B guest worker jobs at Signalโs Orange, Texas \noperations with false promises of permanent residency in the United States for the workers and \ntheir families.  (Id.)   \nII.   Jurisdiction \n  The Burnett Defendants move to dismiss the instant case under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(2) alleging that this court lacks personal jurisdiction over them.  (Doc. No. 36.)  \n2 of 10 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 61   Filed 08/01/14   Page 3 of 10 PageID #:  746\nRule 12(b)(2) requires a court to dismiss a claim if it does not have personal jurisdiction over the \ndefendant.    Grynberg v. BP P.L.C., 855 F. Supp. 2d 625, 638 (S.D. Tex. 2012); see FED. R. CIV. \nP. 12(b)(2).  โWhen a court rules on a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction \nwithout holding an evidentiary hearing, the party asserting jurisdiction is required to present facts \nsufficient to constitute a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction to satisfy its burden.โ  Duke \nEnergy Intโl, L.L.C. v. Napoli, 748 F. Supp. 2d 656, 678 (S.D. Tex. 2010) (citing Central Freight \nLines Inc. v. APA Transport Corp., 322 F.3d 376, 380 (5th Cir. 2003); Alpine View Co. v. Atlas \nCopco  A.B.,  205  F.3d  208,  214  (5th Cir.  2000)).    โ[O]n  a  motion  to  dismiss  for  lack  of \njurisdiction, uncontroverted allegations in the plaintiffโs complaint must be taken as true, and \nconflicts between the facts contained in the partiesโ affidavits must be resolved in the plaintiffโs \nfavor for purposes of determining whether a prima facie case for personal jurisdiction exists.โ  \nBullion v. Gillespie, 895 F.2d 213, 217 (5th Cir. 1990). \nIII.   Analysis   \n  The  undersigned  finds  this  court  has  specific  personal  jurisdiction  over  the  Burnett \nDefendants.   Absent a statute that permits nationwide service of process, when a suit is based \non a federal statute, the court looks to the long-arm statute of the state in which it sits to \ndetermine whether a defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction.   Omni Capital Intern., Ltd. \nRudolf Wolff & Co., Ltd., 484 U.S. 97, 105 (1987).   The Texas long-arm statute confers \njurisdiction to the limits of the federal constitution.   Companion Prop. & Cas.  Ins. Co. v. \nPalermo, 723 F.3d 557, 559 (5th Cir. 2013).   Therefore, the undersignedโs focus is whether the \nexercise of personal jurisdiction offends or satisfies constitutional requirements of due process. \n  In order to satisfy due process, the Burnett Defendants must have โcertain minimum \ncontacts with [Texas] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of \n3 of 10 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 61   Filed 08/01/14   Page 4 of 10 PageID #:  747\nfair play and substantial justice.โ   Parker v. Pro W. Contractors, L.L.C., No. 13-30142, 2013 \nWL 3534082, at *1 (5th Cir. July 15, 2013) (citing Intโl Shoe Co. v. State of Wash., 326 U.S. \n310, 316 (1945)).  โThe minimum contacts requirement is satisfied by either: (1) contacts that \ngive rise to  general  personal jurisdiction or (2) contacts  that give rise to  specific personal \njurisdiction.โ   Id. (citing Wilson v. Belin, 20 F.3d 644, 647 (5th Cir. 1994)).   Because the \nPlaintiffs do not argue minimum contacts are satisfied through general personal jurisdiction, the \nundersigned will focus only on whether the Burnett Defendants have sufficient contacts that give \nrise to specific personal jurisdiction. \n  โSpecific  jurisdiction  is  proper  where  the  defendant  has  โpurposefully  directed  his \nactivities at residents of the forum, and the litigation results from alleged injuries that arise out of \nor relate to those activities.โโ  Parker, 2013 WL 3534082, at *1 (5th Cir. July 15, 2013) (citing \nBurger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 474 (1985)); see also Electrosource, Inc. v. \nHorizon Battery Techs. Ltd., 176 F.3d 867, 871 (5th Cir. 1999) (litigation must arise out of or \nrelate  to  activities  purposefully  directed  at  residents  of  the  forum).    โThe  constitutional \nrequirement for specific jurisdiction is that the defendant has โminimum contactsโ with the forum \nstate such that imposing a judgment would not โoffend traditional notions of fair play and \nsubstantial justice.โโ  Stroman Realty, Inc. v. Wercinski, 513 F.3d 476, 484 (5th Cir. 2008) \n(quoting Intโl Shoe Co. v. State of Wash., Office of Unemployment Comp. & Placement, 326 \nU.S. 310, 316 (1945)).    \nA.   Minimum Contacts \n  1.  The Complaint   \n  In the complaint, the Plaintiffs alleged that Signal authorized Pol, Dewan, and Burnett to \nact as their agents for the purposes of recruiting and providing Indian welders and fitters to fill \n4 of 10 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 61   Filed 08/01/14   Page 5 of 10 PageID #:  748\nanticipated H-2B guest worker jobs at Signalโs Orange, Texas operations.  (Doc. No. 1, p. 13.)  \nActing as Signalโs agents, Burnett then entered into contracts with the Plaintiffs in which they \npromised: (1) the Plaintiffs would work under a permanent resident (green card) program, and \n(2) the Plaintiffs would promptly receive a refund of all or nearly all of their payments if the \nDefendants did not succeed in securing green cards for Plaintiffs.   (Id., p. 18.)  However, \nBurnett had no intention of, and did not apply for or assist the Plaintiffs in obtaining permanent \nresidency for themselves or their families.   (Id., p. 7.)  Furthermore, Burnett did not refund the \nfees the Plaintiffs paid in reliance on Burnettโs false promises.  (Id.)   The Plaintiffs further \nallege that โat all relevant times, Burnett had an attorney-client relationship with each Plaintiff \nfor purposes of immigration issues and Plaintiffsโ work for Signal.โ   (Id., p. 24.)  However, \nonce they were in Signalโs facility, the Plaintiffs were not allowed to speak or meet with Burnett.   \n(Id.)   Furthermore, when the Plaintiffs did try to contract Burnett, their calls were not returned.  \n(Id.)  As a result, the Plaintiffs continued to work at Signal under the false premise that Burnett \nwas working to secure permanent residency for them.       \n  The Plaintiffs have satisfied the minimum contacts requirement by alleging the Burnett \nDefendants committed acts outside of Texas that caused tortious injuries within Texas.  The \nFifth Circuit has held that sufficient minimum contacts are established โ[w]hen a nonresident \ndefendant commits a tort within the state, or an act outside the state that causes tortious injury \nwithin the state.โ   Guidry v. United States Tobacco Co., 188 F.3d 619, 628 (5th Cir. 1999) \n(collecting cases).  โEven an act done outside the state that has consequences or effects within \nthe state will suffice as a basis for jurisdiction in a suit arising from those consequences if the \neffects are seriously harmful and were intended or highly likely to follow from the nonresident \ndefendantโs conduct.โ   Id. (collecting cases).   An individual injured in Texas โneed not go to \n5 of 10 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 61   Filed 08/01/14   Page 6 of 10 PageID #:  749\n[another  jurisdiction]  to  seek  redress  from  persons  who,  though  remaining  in  other  states, \nintentionally, knowingly and recklessly caused severe physical, emotional and economic injuries \nto the plaintiffs and othersโ in Texas.   Id. at 630.  Based upon the complaint, the Plaintiffs \nhave established that the Burnett Defendants have sufficient minimum contacts with Texas \nbecause the alleged tortious acts committed by the  Burnett Defendants, even if most were \ncommitted outside of Texas, caused tortious injuries within Texas.  The Burnett Defendants, \nwho allegedly conspired with Signal to lure the Plaintiffs to Orange, Texas with false promises, \nand who continued to deceive the Plaintiffs once they arrived in Texas by refusing to speak with \nthem and not fulfill their promises, cannot credibly argue that they could not reasonably have \nanticipated being sued in this District.   \n  2.   The Burnett Deposition, Affidavit and Letter2  \n  In his deposition (Doc. No. 43, Exh. A) Burnett stated as follows: \n  I would give the workers their documents and make sure, \nyou know, that all the โ you know, the visas, the applications, the \nexperience letters, resumes . . . where in the proper order.  [I] \nwould go through a litany of information to provide to the workers, \nyou know, and it basically went along these lines: You know, \nwhere youโre working, know your occupation, know your rate of \npay,  know  whether  youโre  going  to  be  working  in  Texas  or \nPascagoula. \n \n  In  response  to  the  Plaintiffโs  attorney  asking  Burnett  if  he  assisted  Signal  in  filing \nEmployment  and  Training  Administration  (โETAโ)  750  applications in  Mississippi  for  the \nworkers that were being moved from Texas to Mississippi, Burnett stated: โYou know, Iโunless \nthey got someone else to do it, Iโm pretty sure I did it.โ  (Doc. No. 43, Exh. B.)   Burnett also \n                                                 \n  2.   โIn resolving a Rule 12(b)(2) motion, the Court may consider โaffidavits, interrogatories, depositions, \noral testimony, or any combination of the recognized methods of discovery.โโ  Allstate Ins. Co. v. Interline Brands, \nInc., No. 3:13-cv-946-B, 2014 WL 462814, at *3 (N.D. Tex. Feb. 5, 2014) (quoting Stuart v. Spademan, 772 F.2d \n1185, 1192 (5th Cir.1985)). \n \n6 of 10 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 61   Filed 08/01/14   Page 7 of 10 PageID #:  750\nstates in his affidavit that he visited Signalโs Texas facility at least once in 2007 โin response to a \nrequest by Signal to generally discuss with the Texas Plant manager the overall status and \nemployment of the non-immigrant workers who had been initially deployed to Signalโs facility \nin Texas.โ  (Doc. No. 36, Exh. 1., p. 2.)   Furthermore, the Plaintiffs have attached as an exhibit \nto their response, a letter  Burnett wrote to the Texas Workforce Commission in which he \nincluded an Application for Alien Employment Certification.  (Doc. No. 43, Exh. E.)   In this \napplication, Burnett wrote that โ110 unnamed weldersโ would be working in Orange, Texas.  \n(Id.)   \nThis evidence establishes Burnett โpurposefully directed his activities at residents of the \nforum,  and  the  litigation  results  from  alleged  injuries  that  arise  out  of  or  relate  to  those \nactivities.โ  Parker, 2013 WL 3534082, at *1 (5th Cir. July 15, 2013).   Burnett knew the \nPlaintiffs would be working in Pascagoula, Mississippi or Orange, Texas, and he visited Texas \non  at  least  one  occasion  to  discuss  the  status  of  the  workers.   Burnett  also  submitted  an \nApplication  for  Employment  Certification  with  the  Texas  Workforce  Commission  to  get \napproval for Signal to hire โ110 unnamed weldersโ for its Orange, Texas facility.   In summary, \nBurnett โprovided legal services for clients in Texas and he knew that those legal services were \nused to obtain workers for the man camp in Texas.โ  (Doc. No. 43, p. 9.)     \nB.  Traditional Notions of Fair Play and Substantial Justice \nThe  undersigned  also  finds  it  will  not  โoffend  traditional  notions  of  fair  play  and \nsubstantial justiceโ for this court to exercise personal jurisdiction over the Burnett Defendants.   \nThe Fifth Circuit has used the following test to assess the reasonableness of a courtโs exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction: โ(1) the burden upon the nonresident defendant to litigate in that forum; (2) \nthe forum stateโs interests in the matter; (3) the plaintiffโs interest in securing relief; (4) the \n7 of 10 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 61   Filed 08/01/14   Page 8 of 10 PageID #:  751\ninterstate judicial systemโs interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies; \nand (5) the several statesโ shared interest in furthering substantive social policies.โ   Stroman \nRealty, Inc. v. Wercinski, 513 F.3d 476, 487 (5th Cir. 2008) (citing Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. \nSuperior Court, 480 U.S. 102, 113 (1987)).   First, the Burnett Defendants will not face a large \nburden in litigating the instant case in this District, because the Burnett Defendants, who consist \nof a single attorney and two โinactiveโ companies, are located in Louisiana, which is contiguous \nto Texas.  Second, the forum state, Texas, does have an interest in the matter because the \nPlaintiffs  were  allegedly  injured  while  working  at  Signalโs  Orange,  Texas  facility.    Third, \nkeeping the Burnett Defendants claims in this District will provide the most efficient resolution \nof this case.  Notwithstanding their status as putative class members, the Plaintiffs have already \nmoved  their  case  once  from  a  different  federal  district  court  after  their  motion  for  class \ncertification was denied.   David v. Signal Intโl, LLC, Civ. A. No. 08-1220, 2012 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 114247, at *129 (E.D. La. Jan. 3, 2012).  The most expeditious option at this point \nwould be to continue this case in this District.   Finally, the Burnett Defendants have not pointed \nout any clashes between the substantive social policies of Texas and any other potential forum \nstate in regards to this case.  There is no reason to believe that the State of Texas and the other \npotential forum state have different levels of interest in or conflicting views on the social issues \npervading  this  case.    Taking  these  factors  into  consideration,  the  undersigned  finds  that \ntraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice will not be offended by exercising personal \njurisdiction over the Burnett Defendants.    \nIn summary, the undersigned finds the Plaintiffs have established a prima facie case that \nthis court has personal jurisdiction over the Burnett Defendants by showing 1) the Burnett \nDefendants have sufficient minimum contacts with Texas; and 2) it will not offend traditional \n8 of 10 \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 61   Filed 08/01/14   Page 9 of 10 PageID #:  752\nnotions of fair play and substantial justice for this court to exercise personal jurisdiction over the \nBurnett Defendants. \nIV.  Recommendation \n  For the reasons stated above, the โMotion and Memorandum in Support of Motion of \nMalvern C. Burnett, the Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C., and Gulf Coast Immigration \nLaw Center, L.L.C. to Dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2)โ (Doc. No. 36) should be \nDENIED.   \nV.

This is a human trafficking case brought by Indian workers who were trafficked \ninto the United States through the governm entโs H-2B guest worker program .  Plaintiffs were \ntrafficked to the state of Texas in order to provide labor and services to Signal International, Inc., \nSignal International, LLC, Signal International Texas, G.P., and Signal International Texas, L.P. \n(collectively, โSignalโ).  Defendants recruited Plaintiffs for positions as pipefitters and welders \nwith Signal using false promises of assistance in applying for and obtaining permanent residence \nin the United States.  Defendants then bilked Plai ntiffs out of tens of thousands of dollars in \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 2 of 76 PageID #:  2\nโrecruitment feesโ (for which Plai ntiffs assumed massive debt), trafficked them into the United  \nStates, forced them to live in squalid condition s in a gated,  guarded, isolated labor camp, and \nrequired them to pay exorbitant sums for the โpri vilegeโ of living in these repulsive conditions.   \nIf Plaintiffs complained, they were threatened with adverse immigration and employment action \nand the resulting prospect of financial ruin. \n2.  Plaintiffs are all former employees of Signalโs Orange, Texas facility.  Plaintiffs \nbring this action to recover for the unlawful  and fraudulent conduct of Signal and its agents: \nMalvern C. Burnett; the  Law Off ices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C.; Gulf  Coast I mmigration \nLaw Center, LLC; Sachin Dewan; Dewan Consu ltant Pvt. Ltd.; Michael Pol; and Global \nResources, Inc. (the โAgentsโ).1 \n3.  Signal is a Gulf Coast-based marine and fabrication company.  Faced with a labor \nshortage and significant volum e of work in the wake of Hurrican e Katrina, S ignal sought to \nrecruit s everal hund red Indian wo rkers for p ositions as welders and  pipefitters in Signalโs  \nfacilities in Orange, Texas and Pascagoula, Mississippi. \n4.  Signal retained the Agents to as sist in the re cruitment process.  Sp ecifically, \nSignal retained Michael Pol and his com pany Global Resources, Inc. (collectively referred to as \nโPolโ unless a distinction is drawn), a labor r ecruitment firm based in Mississ ippi; attorney \nMalvern C. Burnett and  his law firm s, the Law  Offices of Malvern C. Burnett an d Gulf Coast \nImmigration Law Center, LLC (collectively ref erred to as โBurnettโ unl ess a distinction is \n                                              \n1   On June 13, 2013, Michael Pol filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the United States \nBankruptcy Court for the Southern District  of Mississippi (Case No. 13- 51168-KMG).  \nDue to the automatic bankruptcy stay, Michael Pol has not been included as a defendant \nin this action. \n- 2 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 3 of 76 PageID #:  3\ndrawn); and Sachin Dewan and his company, Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd. (collectively referred \nto as โDewanโ unless a distin ction is drawn), a  labor recruitment firm in India.  Signal also \nexecuted a power of attorney authorizing Dewan Consultants to recruit for Signal abroad. \n5.  To minimize cost to Signal, Defendants  and Pol designed a schem e in which the \nworkers would pay for their own recruitm ent, immigration processing, and travel, which was \nmemorialized in the April 18,  2006 Skilled Worker Agreement between Signal and Global.   \nUnder this scheme, any expenses and fees not  paid up front by the workers would be paid by \nGlobal.  Global, in turn, would deduct amounts from the workersโ wages in order to recoup those \nexpenses and fees directly from the workers.  Signal, however, would pay nothing. \n6.  By at least m id-2006, the Agents and, upon inform ation and belief, \nrepresentatives of Signal began tr aveling to In dia to rec ruit workers, including Plaintiffs.  In \nnewspaper advertisements and in-person m eetings, Defendants and Pol prom ised to provide \nstable employment and assist Plaintiffs and other workers in  applying for and obtaining a green \ncard for perm anent residence in the United S tates.  In ex change, Plaintiffs and other workers  \nwere required to pay for โrecruitm ent feesโ to the Agentsโranging anywhere from $10,000 to \n$25,000.  Defendants and Pol further represented that Plaintiffsโ families would be able to jo in \nthem in the United States.   \n7.  To alleviate any concerns about the pot ential living conditions in the United \nStates, Defendants and Pol repres ented during in-person m eetings that the liv ing conditions \nwould be comparable to those some of the Plai ntiffs described experiencing in Singapore and \nDubaiโwhich included, for example, a shar ed two-bedroom  a partment, quality food, \ntransportation to and from the job site, and one trip back to India per year. \n- 3 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 4 of 76 PageID #:  4\n8.  Because Signalโs need  for workers was  immediate, Defendants and Pol told  \nPlaintiffs they would first ac quire temporary work visas (H-2 B) because the visas could be \nobtained faster than green cards, but that De fendants would also apply for green cards on \nPlaintiffsโ behalf. \n9.  Lured by D efendantsโ fraudulent promises of legal and perm anent work-based \nimmigration to the United States for themselves and their families, Plaintiffs paid the exorbitant \nrecruiting fees to take advantage of the seem ingly promising opportunities, causing them selves \nand their families to incur massive debt.  Inde ed, to cover the recruiting and immigration fees \nPlaintiffs often had to sell fam ily assets, take  out loans secured by real property and jewelry, \nborrow m oney with high interest  rates, and otherwise incur life -altering debt.   Plaintiffs \nundertook such debt and paid th e recruiting and imm igration fees in reasonable reliance on \nDefendantsโ promises.  In further reliance on Defendantsโ promises, some Plaintiffs relinquished \nstable employment opportunities in Singapore and elsewhere. \n10.  Defendants, however, had no intention of making good on their promises to assist \nPlaintiffs in applying for and  obtaining permanent residency.   To be sure, Defendants did not \ntakeโindeed, had no intention of  takingโsteps to assist Plainti ffs in applying for or obtaining \npermanent residency.  In fact, at the suggestion  of its Agents, Signal repr esented to the United \nStates governm ent that it was employing the  Indian workers (incl uding Plaintiffs) only \ntemporarily and that they would be  returned to India โwithin the . . . year.โ  Moreover, internal \ncorrespondence among Signal management from May 2006 reflects that โ[a] ll [Signal is] doing \nnow is bringing the workers in under the H2B program.โ \n11.  Defendants never inform ed Plaintiffs th at they had no intention of assisting \nPlaintiffs in applying for or obtaining green cards.  Nor did Defendants ever disclose to Plaintiffs \n- 4 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 5 of 76 PageID #:  5\nthe representations they made to the United States government regarding the temporary nature of \ntheir employment and residence.   Plaintiffs were sim ply unaware that Defendantsโ prom ises \nregarding employment and permanent residency were false and re lied on the f alse promises to \ntheir detriment. \n12.  Upon arrival in the United States, Signal requ ired Plaintiffs to live in an isolated, \nIndian-only labor camp located outside of Orange , Texas (the โTexas Labor Cam pโ).  Contrary \nto Defendantsโ representations  regarding living conditions, the  conditions at the T exas Labor \nCamp were horrid.  Plaintiffs were forced to live in cramped trailersโcontaining up to 24 menโ\nwith little to no priva cy.  The tr ailers were so crowded som e Plaintiffs had to sleep on their \nluggage.  T he trailers had insufficient bathroom f acilities (one or two toile ts) that were rarely \ncleaned, which created not only an awful smell but also unsanitary living conditions.  Food was \navailable only at certain hours and was often rotten.  As a res ult of the conditions, several of the \nresidents became sick.  The cam p was also fenced, gated, and guarded, such  that Plaintiffs felt \nthey were being imprisoned.   \n13.  As with the โrecru itment fees,โ th e cost to live at the T exas Labor Cam p was \nborne by Plaintiffs.  Indeed, Signal charged P laintiffs mightily for the โrightโ to endure the \nhorrible conditions at the cam pโdeducting $35 per day seven days a week ($1,050 per m onth) \nout of the Plaintiffsโ pre-tax earnings.  If work ers asked to live of f-site, Signal informed them \nthat it would still  deduct $1,050 per m onth from their income, effectively prohibiting workers \nfrom seeking more humane and sanitary conditions. \n14.  Significantly, non-Indian workers were not placed in guarded labor camps, were \nnot subjected to squalid living conditions, and di d not have exorbitant room  and board fees \ndeducted from their pre-tax earnings. \n- 5 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 6 of 76 PageID #:  6\n15.  The Indian workers at the Texas Labor  Camp, including Plaintiffs, were also \nsubjected to different, less favorable em ployment conditions than non-Indians.  Upon \ninformation and belief, Indian workers were assigned projects that were more difficult and m ore \ndangerous than those assigned to  non-Indian   workers, received te rms and conditions  of \nemployment that were different from  and less  favorable than non-Indian em ployees, and were \nsubjected to offensive anti-Indian diatribe and repeated threats of deportation. \n16.  To ensure an addition al elem ent of c ontrol over Plaintiffs and other Indian \nworkers, Signal required Plaintiffs and othe r Indian workers to set up direct deposit bank \naccounts to which Sig nal maintained access.   These accounts effectively perm itted Signal to \ncontrol workersโ ab ility to leav e the facility by  threatening to cut off access to th e accounts.  \nUpon information and belief, Signal did exactly  that to an Indian worker who had fled the \nPascagoula, Mississippi facility.   \n17.  Faced with crushing debt and fearful of  the possibility of deportation by Signal \nshould they com plain, Plaintiffs fe lt com pelled to continue working for Signal despite the \ndreadful conditions at the Texas L abor Camp, the extortionate room  and board f ees, and the \ndiscriminatory employment conditions.  Simply put, Plaintiffs felt that they had no other option. \n18.  The compulsion Plaintiffs felt to continue working at Signal only increased when \nthey learned about the events that  transpired at the Pascagoula,  Mississippi facility on March 9, \n2007.  Upset that workers were com plaining about conditions at the facility, Signal decided to \nterminate and forcibly send five of t he more vocal Indian workers back to India.  Signal locked  \nthe gate at the Pascagoula facility, preventing workers from leaving, rounded up and detained the \nvocal workers, and informed them that they were being deported.  One of these workers was so \ndistraught over the threat of returning to I ndia without paying the debt he incurred over the \n- 6 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 7 of 76 PageID #:  7\nrecruitment f ees that he attem pted to comm it suicide.  W hen news of the events and the  \nattempted suicide traveled to th e Texas Labo r Camp, Plaintiffs becam e even more afra id to \ncomplain about the con ditions they had been subj ect to.  Understandably, Plaintiffs feared that  \nthey would be returned to India and/or physically harmed if they did so. \n19.  Ultimately, less th an a year- and-a-half after coming to the Texas Lab or Camp, \nPlaintiffs were either term inated or told they  were being sent to work at the Pascagoula, \nMississippi facility for lower wages.  Faced with the latter prospect, some Plaintiffs escaped and \nfled the Texas Labor Camp. \n20.  At no point did Defendants apply for or  assist Plaintiffs in obtaining perm anent \nresidency for them selves or their fa milies.   At no point did Defendant s refund the tens of \nthousands of dollars in recrui tment and imm igration fees Plai ntiffs paid in reliance on \nDefendantsโ false promises.  And at no point did Defendants compensate or offer to compensate \nPlaintiffs for the conditions they were forced to  endure at the Texas Labor Cam p.  Indeed, at no \npoint did they even offer an apology.  Instead , Defendants m aintain that how they treated \nPlaintiffs and the other Indian workers was both lawful and moral.  This mistaken viewpoint was \nmost recently espoused by Signalโs CEO in a pre ss release, brazenly  declaring that Signal \nโtreated [the Indian wo rkers] with dignity a nd respect jus t as we treat each and ev ery Signal \nemployee.โ \n21.  Signalโs self-delusion aside,  Plaintiffs were victim s  of reprehensible conduct.   \nPlaintiffs assert claims arising from violations of their rights  under the Victim s of Trafficking \nand Violence Protection Act (โTVPAโ), the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. ยง 1981), the Ku \nKlux Klan Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. ยง 1985), and claims for damages arising from fraud, negligent \nmisrepresentation, and breach of contract. \n- 7 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 8 of 76 PageID #:  8\n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n22.

This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over causes of action based on state law \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง  1367(a), as the state law claim s arise out  of the same nucleus of facts \nthat support the federal claims. \n24.  Additionally, this Court has  personal jurisdiction over Signal entities pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ.

This Court also has personal jurisdiction over the other Defendants under Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 4(h) and Texas Code ยง  17.042, because th ey recruited Plaintiffs for e mployment at \nSignalโs Orange, Texas facility, had substantial business contacts with Texas, and a substantia l \nportion of the comm unications, transactions, events, or omissions underlying Plaintiffsโ claims  \neither occurred in Texas or occurred to secure labor for Signalโs Orange, Texas facility. \n26.

The destruction caused by Hurrican e Katrina presented Signal with the potential \nto take on lucrative new work fixing damaged oil rigs, ships, and other machine platforms.  As a \nresult of the hurricane, however, som e of Signalโs workforce had left the Gulf Coast area, and \nSignal was in need of additional laborersโparticularly skilled fitters and welders. \n58.  In early 2006, Pol approached Signal about providing additional workers for their \noperations.  He inf ormed them that he could p rovide skilled fitters and welders f rom India to \nwork for Signal at no cost to Signal.  \n- 13 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 14 of 76 PageID #:  14\n59.  Pol explained to Signal that he would work with Burnett and Dewan to recruit the \nworkers and obtain the appropriate  immigration status for such workers , but that th e workers, \nincluding Plaintiffs, would pay fo r all costs  and fees asso ciated with the rec ruitment process, \nimmigration processing, and travel to the Un ited S tates.  Signal w ould pay the workers, \nincluding Plaintiffs, between $14 - $18/hour, depending on each workerโs skill level. \n60.  Signal and  Global ex ecuted a S killed W orker Recruitm ent Agreem ent (the \nโRecruitment Agreementโ) on or about April 18, 2006, which set forth certain terms for Michael \nPol and Global to recruit foreign skilled worker s for employment at Signal โunder the โH-2Bโ \ntemporary program and/or the โperm anent residenceโ process.โ  The Recruitm ent Agreement \nrequired Global to be responsible  for delivering the workers โat  no cost to Si gnalโ, including \npaying for all costs associated w ith recruitment, transportation, and entry into the United States \nby the foreign workers.   The co sts incurred by Po l and Global were to be paid by the foreign \nworkers, including Plaintiffs. \n61.  Dewan and Signal entered into a power of  attorney on or about June 19, 2006, \nwhich permitted Dewan to act as Signalโs โrepresentative in India to facilitate the recruitment of \nskilled workers to the U nited States of Americaโ  for employment with Signal.  This power of \nattorney authorized Dewan to advertise, conduct seminars, conduct skills tests and sign necessary \nlegal documentation related to the recruitment of skilled workers to work in the United States for \nSignal.  \n62.  In approxim ately m id- to late-2006, Si gnal entered into an attorney-client \nrelationship with Burnett with respect to legal issues related to Signalโs need for foreign workers.  \nUpon information and belief, Signal and Burnett en tered into a written retainer agreem ent.  \nUnder the retainer agreement, however, Signal would not be responsible for any legal fees owed \n- 14 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 15 of 76 PageID #:  15\nto Burnett, but instead Burnett would receive compensation out of the โrecruitment feesโ paid by \nthe foreign workers, including Plaintiffs. \nThe Agents Recruited Plaintiffs and Other Indian Workers for Signal \n63.  Acting as Signalโs recruiting agents for the purposes of facilitating the recruitment \nof Indian workers for em ployment at Signal, Pol and Dewan pl aced advertisem ents in \nnewspapers throughout India and the United Arab  Emirates in the spring, summ er, and fall of \n2006 offering opportunities for welders and fitters to immigrate permanently to the United States \nunder the auspices of Signal, a purported leading marine and fabrication company in Mississippi \nand Texas. \n64.  Upon information and belief, Plaintiffs we re targeted for recruitm ent based on \ntheir race and/or national origin. \n65.  Among other things, the advertisem ents and recru iting efforts prom ised \nโpermanent lifetime settlement in USA f or self and f amilies,โ โpermanent residencyโ in the \nUnited States, and/or โgreen cards.โ  Upon in formation and belief,  Pol and Dewan undertook \nthese advertisements and other recruiting efforts  on behalf of, at the direction of, and/or in \ncoordination with Signal and Burnett.  \n66.  Signal authorized Pol, Dewan, and Burnett to act as their agents for the p urposes \nof recruiting and providing Indian welders and fitters to fill anticipated H-2B guest worker jobs \nat Signalโs Orange, Texas operations. \n67.  Upon inform ation and belief, Signal fu rther authorized Pol and Dewan to \nrepresent that Signal would agree to sponsor bona fide green ca rd applications for the Plaintiffs \nand obtain at least two H-2B visa  extensions on behalf of Plaintiffs to allow them to remain in \nthe United States working for Signal while their green card applications were being processed. \n- 15 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 16 of 76 PageID #:  16\n68.  Upon information and belief, Signal authorized these representations even though \nit knew or had reason to know that such visa extensions and green card applications would not be \nbona fide, valid, or lawful unde r United States immigration law  and even though Signal did not \nhave the intention at that time to apply for visa extensions and/or green cards on behalf of all the \nIndian workers, including the Plaintiffs. \n69.  At the latest, Signal learned from  the firs t Indian workers to arrive at Signalโs  \nfacilities in Texas and Mississipp iโworkers who  arrived well in advance of Plaintiffsโthat \nthose workers had paid exorbitant recruitment fees to the Agents, and had m ade those payments \non the basis of prom ises of assistance in a pplying for and obtaining green cards which Signal \nknew was false.  Signal nonetheless  continued to facilitate the transportation of hundreds more \nIndian workers to Signal worksites in Texas and Mississippi, including Plaintiffs, because it was \nin Signalโs financial interest to do so. \nPlaintiffs Incurred Substantial Debt to Pay the Agentsโ โRecruitment Feesโ \n70.  In response to the advertisem ents  posted by Pol and Dewan, Plaintiffs \ncommunicated with Pol and Dewan in the spri ng, summer, and fall of 2006 via telephone, and \nattended in-person meetings with Pol, Dewan, and Burnett.  During those meetings, the Agents \ninformed Plaintiffs that the job opportunities that  had been advertised were with Signal.  In \naddition, the Agents, acting on Signalโs behalf, informed Plaintiffs of the opportunity to work for \nSignal on H-2B visas which would lead to permanent resident (green card) status. \n71.  Specifically, the Agents promised recruits, including Plaintiffs, that Signal would \nsponsor Plaintiffsโ green card applications and extend their H-2B  visas multiple times to enable \nPlaintiffs to work in the United States while  their green card applications were pending.  In \n- 16 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 17 of 76 PageID #:  17\nexchange, each Plaintiff would have to pay fees totaling as much as 8 lakh rupees (approximately \n$18,000) in a series of approximately three installments. \n72.  At the time Plaintiffs made their paym ents, one rupee was worth approxim ately \n$0.0225, and one lakh (100,000 rupees) was worth approximately $2,250. \n73.  The Agents further informed recruits, including Plaintiffs, that they would be able \nto obtain legal permanent residence for their spouses and children. \n74.  In addition, during the telephone comm unications, at recruitm ent meetings, and \nthrough written documents, the Agents (includi ng through their employees) represented to \nPlaintiffs that Defendant Si gnal would provide lawful, st able, and am ple em ployment \nopportunities, that working under an H-2B visa for Signal was not inconsistent with applying for \npermanent immigration status sponsored by Signal , and that Signal would  obtain for Plaintiffs \nwork-authorized green cards enabling the Plainti ffs to perm anently and legally reside in the \nUnited States with their families. \n75.  In such co mmunications with Pla intiffs, the Agents f urther prom ised to ac t \ndiligently and do everything necessary to ensure that Plaintiffs obtain green cards within 18-24 \nmonths of initiating the green card process. \n76.  Upon information and belief, employees of Signal attended some of the meetings \nand testing sessions with potential workers in India.  Further, upon information and belief, prior \nto the meetings and testing sessions Signal and th e Agents conferred regarding the logistics and \nsubstantive content of the meetings and testing sessions. \n77.  In reasonab le reliance on the Agentโs prom ises regard ing green cards and \nemployment opportunities in the U nited States, Plaintiffs undertook cons iderable personal and \nfamilial sa crifices, including the mortgaging   and/or s ale of  personal prope rty and othe r \n- 17 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 18 of 76 PageID #:  18\nincurrence of debt, in order to am ass the funds necessary to initiate the green card process with \nDefendant Signal.  F or exam ple, Plaint iff Satheesh K annan Marimuthu, Balam urugan \nMarimuthu, and Rajendran Sappani sold their wive sโ jewelry and/or mortgaged their fam iliesโ \nhomes to cover the recruitm ent fees.  In a ddition, several Plaintiffs relinquished stable \nemployment in reliance on the Agentโs representations. \n78.  Reasonably relying on these and other prom ises made to them  regarding green \ncards and work opportunities in the United States, Plaintiffs signed green card contracts with the \nAgents at v arious points from  mid-2006 to earl y 2007 and  paid the ex orbitant recruiting fees \nrequired by the contracts. \n79.  These contracts and other docum ents provided by the Agents prom ised that (1) \nPlaintiffs would work under a โp ermanent resident (green card)  program,โ and (2) Plaintiffs  \nwould promptly receive a refund of all or nearly  all of their paym ents if Defendants did not \nsucceed in securing green cards for Plaintiffs. \n80.  The Agents knew or should have known,  however, that they would not refund \nPlaintiffsโ money as promised in the contracts and other documents. \n81.  The Agents induced Plaintiffs to enter into the green card contracts without intent \nto diligently pursue Plaintiffsโ applications a nd without any basis whatso ever for representing \nthat Signal had lawful long-te rm employment opportunities to pr ovide Plaintiffs; that Signal \ncould legally apply for num erous H-2B visa extensions to m aintain Plaintiffsโ presence in th e \nUnited States; that working under an H-2B visa for Signal was not inconsistent with applying for \npermanent immigration status sponsored by Signal; that green card applications sponsored by the \nSignal would be valid and bona fide under U.S. immigration law; and that such applications were \nlikely to be successfully completed and approved within the promised timelines. \n- 18 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 19 of 76 PageID #:  19\n82.  Plaintiffs would not have signed the green card contracts or paid the extraordinary \nrecruitment fees charg ed by the Agents had  they  kno wn that Defendantsโ p romises an d \nrepresentations were false and  that Defendants had faile d to disclose material facts concerning \nthe nature and terms and conditions of the immigration and work opportunities offered. \nDefendants Arranged for H-2B Visas \n83.  On or about July 20, 2006, and August 17, 2006, the United States Department of \nLabor approved Signalโs labor certification applications for 590 H-2B workers for the period of \nOctober 1, 2006 through July 31, 2007. \n84.  In approving these applications, the United  States Department of Labor relied on \nthe accuracy of the applicationsโ stated 10-month period of need. \n85.  Upon inform ation and belief, the Departm ent of Laborโs internal guidelines \nprohibit it from  granting labor certification ap plications without relying on the applicationsโ \nstatement of need. \n86.  In late August and early Septem ber  2006, the United S tates Citizenship and \nImmigration Service (โUSCISโ) approved Signalโs H-2B visa petitions for 590 H-2B workers for \nthe period of October 1, 2006 through July 31, 2007. \n87.  In approv ing these v isa petition s, the  USCIS relied on  the accuracy of the \npetitionsโ stated 10-m onth period  of labor need and the represen tation that Signa lโs need was \nbased on a one-time, peak-load, temporary demand.  Indeed, according to regulation, the USCIS \nmust rely o n the stated  period  of the petitionerโs labor need.   See 8 C.F.R. 214.2(h)(6)(ii)(B) \n(2006). \n88.  Defendants knew that the stated period of  need in Signalโs applications f or labor \ncertifications and for H-2B visas were incons istent with Signalโs prom ises of perm anent \n- 19 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 20 of 76 PageID #:  20\nresidency to Plaintiffs and its actual projecte d labor need and, therefore, Defendants knew these \nstatements to the government were false. \n89.  The Agents used the H-2B visas, obtained from the federal governm ent on the  \nbasis of false statements by Signal and Burnett, to elicit payments from Plaintiffs. \nDefendants Prepared to Bring Plaintiffs and Other Indian Workers \nto the United States \n90.  At various times during the spring, su mmer, and fall of 2006, Signal employees  \nand certain of the Agents traveled  to various locations in India and the United Arab Emirates to \ntest Plaintiffsโ welding and pipefitting skills in anticipation of employing Plaintiffs in the United \nStates. \n91.  Plaintiffs paid to travel to the cities where these tests were held. \n92.  Plaintiffs also paid admission fees in order to take these tests. \n93.  Plaintiffs attended and passe d these tests, which were  overseen and graded by \nSignal and/or Dewanโs agents, employees, and/or representatives. \n94.  Upon information and belief, prior to atte nding these testing sessions the Agents \nand Signal conferred regarding the logistics and substantive content of the testing sessions. \n95.  After USCIS visa approval, Plaintiffs made necessary preparations to travel to the \nUnited States on H-2B visas to work for Signal,  including: paying to obtain necessary travel and \nlegal documents; making payments to the United States Consulate and the Agents for mandatory \nH-2B visa and consular processing fees; attending H-2B visa interviews; and, paying the Agents \nfor travel arrangements. \n96.  In order to secure H-2B visas to work  for Signal, Plaintiffs attended interviews \nwith United States consular offices in Indian cities. \n- 20 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 21 of 76 PageID #:  21\n97.  To attend these consular interviews, Plainti ffs had to pay the costs of travel from \ntheir homes and/or current places of employment to various large Indian cities including Chennai \n(Madras) and Mumbai (Bombay). \n98.  The Agents required that Plaintiffs meet with Global, Pol, and/or Burnett in these \ncities before attending their consular interviews. \n99.  Upon information and belief, prior to these meetings, the Agents conferred among \nthemselves and with Signal reg arding the topics to be discussed and instru ctions to be given to \nPlaintiffs at these meetings. \n100.  At the pre-interview meetings, the Agents ensured that Plaintiffs were up-to-date \non paying the recruitment fee installments required by their green card contracts. \n101.  Defendants further required that Plaint iffs pay an additional fee of 35,000 to \n45,000 rupees ($787 to $1,012) for H-2B visa processing. \n102.  The Agents required Plaintif fs to sign docum ents permitting Dewan to receive  \ntheir visa-stamped passports from the consular offices on Plaintiffsโ behalf. \n103.  The Agents also coached Plaintiffs on what to say during consular interviews. \n104.  The Agents told P laintiffs that if  they did no t follow these instructions at the ir \ninterviews, Plaintiffs would not  receive their visas and would forfeit all of the m oney they had \nalready paid to Defendants, in addition to losing the opportunity to permanently immigrate to the \nUnited States. \n105.  During Plaintiffsโ consular interviews, th e consular official s took Plaintiffsโ  \npassports from them. \n106.  Once Plaintiffsโ visas w ere approved, consular officials sent the passports, with \nH-2B visas affixed, directly to Dewan. \n- 21 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 22 of 76 PageID #:  22\n107.  After Plaintiffsโ visas w ere approved, the  Agents made travel arrang ements for \nPlaintiffsโ departures to the United States. \n108.  Before Plaintiffs could  leav e for the Un ited States,  however, Plain tiffs were \nrequired to attend final m eetings in Dewanโs office.  Such  meetings typically took place m ere \nhours before Plaintiffsโ scheduled departures to the United States, when Dewanโs office was full \nof other Indian workers anxiously awaiting their departure to the United States.  \n109.  At these meetings, Pol and Dewan collected final installment payments required \nby Plaintiffsโ green card contracts. \n110.  Pol and Dewan also required Plaintiffsโm ost of whom do not  or did not at the \ntime proficiently read or speak Englishโto sign  English-language documents with little or no \ntime for review.  They did not allow Plaintiffs  to keep a copy of the documents.  Pol and Dewan \nor their staff de manded that Plaintiffs quickly sign the m andatory documents to avoid m issing \nthe flights to the United States and forfeiting the fees Plaintiffs had paid. \n111.  Plaintiffs had no reasonable opportunity  to review, negotiate, or m ake any \nchanges to the documents presented to them.  Even when Plaintiffs asked Defendants what the \ndocuments said, Defendants refused to interpret or tell Plaintiffs what the documents said. \n112.  Dewan also refused to provide receipts to Plaintiffs who requested evidence of the \namounts paid prior to Plaintiffsโ travel to the United States. \n113.  Pol and Dewan refused to return Plai ntiffsโ passportsโwhich had been in \nDefendant Dewanโs possession since after Plain tiffsโ H-2B vi sas were approved by consular \nofficialsโuntil Plaintiffs had paid the final installments and signed the mandatory paperwork. \n- 22 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 23 of 76 PageID #:  23\n114.  Without possession of their passports,  and within this anxious and rushed \natmosphere, Plaintiffs had no reasonable opport unity to review, negotiate, and/or m ake any \nchanges to the documents presented to them. \n115.  On occasions when workers failed to presen t sufficient funds to pay  the final \ninstallment required by the green card contracts, Dewan and his associates threatened to destroy \nand/or deface the workersโ passports.  Such thr eats were made in the presence of other workers, \ncausing the other work ers to reas onably believe that they h ad no choice but to pay the final \ninstallments in full. \n116.  Because of the Dewan and Polโs coerciv e behavior during these p re-departure \nmeetings, and Plaintiffsโ extraordinary and incr easing levels of debt,  Plaintiffs reasonably \nbelieved that they had no choice but to m ake the payments required by the Agents and to travel \nto the United States to work for Signal. \n117.  Plaintiffs did not rece ive their pas sports from the Agents  until Plain tiffs had \nfulfilled all of Defendantsโ requirements. \n118.  At various times from late October 2006 to April 2007, Plaintiffs and other Indian \nworkers traveled from Mumbai to the United States on tickets arranged by Pol and Dewan. \n119.  Signal collected Plaintiffs at the Houston airport upon their arrival and transported \nthem immediately to the Texas Labor Camp. \n120.  Signal sent approximately 300 workers to its Pascagoula, Mississippi facility (the \nโMississippi Labor Campโ), and approximately 290 workers were sent to the Texas Labor Camp \nupon arrival in the United States. \n121.  Plaintiffs had no choice but to use th e Agents to secure em ployment wit h \nDefendant Signal.  Managem ent personnel at Si gnal prohibited Indian workers from  securing \n- 23 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 24 of 76 PageID #:  24\nemployment at Signalโs operations  either through another recru iter or by bypassing  recruiters \naltogether and applying directly with Signal. \nMalvern Burnett Purported to be Plaintiffsโ Attorney \n122.  At all re levant tim es, Burnett ha d an attorn ey-client re lationship with each \nPlaintiff for purposes of immigration issues and Plaintiffsโ work for Signal. \n123.  Burnett prepared the immigration forms required for Plaintiffs to apply for H-2B \nstatus.  In those forms, Burnett represented to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, under \npenalty of perjury, that the Plaintiffs would stay in the United States only temporarily, returning \nto India within the yea r.  At the sa me time Burnett was submitting those forms, he was telling \nworkers, including Plaintiffs, that they would be  eligible for permanent residency, and that he \nwould assist them in applying for green cards.  Further, Burnett was aware of the representations \nPol and Dewan had made to Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, regarding receiving green cards \nin connection with employment at Signal. \n124.  Burnett concealed his true loyalties fr om Plaintiffs.  By m id-2006, Burnett had  \nentered into an attorney-client relationship with Signal for the broad purpose of applying for and \nobtaining lawful status for Indi an workers to com e to the Un ited States.  In 2007, Signal and \nBurnett en tered in to a  Retaine r Agreem ent m emorializing the a rrangementโnamely, that \nBurnett would represent Signal at zero cost because the fees for his work were to be p aid by the \nIndian workers, including Plaintiffs. \n125.  Burnett di d not  di sclose hi s a ttorney-client relationship or the paym ent \narrangement with Signal to the Indian workers, including Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs did not waive any \nconflict of interest caused by Burnettโs relationship with Signal. \n- 24 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 25 of 76 PageID #:  25\n126.  Burnett also entered into an attorn ey-client relationship with Dewan and Pol,  \nstarting no later than m id-2006.  Bu rnett did not disclose these  relationships to the Indian \nworkers, including Plaintiffs.  Plai ntiffs did not waive any conflicts of interest relating to this \nrelationship. \n127.  Burnett also had a โMultilateral Business Agreementโ with Dewan and Pol for the \nbroad purpose of recruiting Indian workers to  come to the United States.  Burn ett did not \ndisclose this agreement to the Ind ian workers, including Plaintiffs, nor  did he receive their \napproval for it. \n128.  Burnettโs attitude toward his Indian clients was poignantly displayed in an em ail \nBurnett sent to Dewan and Pol on December 16, 2006, regarding a Signal worker and client of \nBurnett.  The worker/client had stopped payment on a check to Burnett, and Burnett told Dewan \nand Pol to ensure that โthe idiotโ restores the payment and threatened to have the worker/clientโs \nvisa โmysteriouslyโ revoked if he did not pay.   Later in the em ail, Burnett ref erred to all th e \nIndian workers, who were his clients, as โthe  idiotsโ and speculated  about whether he should \nthreaten them with โimmediate deportationโ in order to prevent them from stopping payment on \nfuture checks. \n129.  Despite repeated representations  that  Burnet t was Pl aintiffโs l awyer for \nimmigration purposes, Plaintiffs were not generally  allowed to speak or meet with Burnett.  For \nexample, on occasion,  Signal representatives in formed Plaintiff Satheesh Kannan Marim uthu \nthat he could not meet with Burnett because it would โviolate company policy.โ  When Plaintiff \nMuruganandam Arumugam attempted to speak with Burnett, his calls went unreturned. \n130.  In a clear violation of his professional obligations, Burnett also forwarded e-mails \nhe received from his Indian clients to Dewan without permission from his clients. \n- 25 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 26 of 76 PageID #:  26\nSignal Subjected Plaintiffs to Degrading and Discriminatory Conditions at the Texas Labor \nCamp \n131.  Signal assigned Plaintiffs to work at its facility in Orange, Texas, and reside at the \nTexas Labor Camp, a crowded โman campโ consisting of trailer-like bunkhouses surrounded by \nbarbed-wire fences and accessible only by a guarded entrance.  When Plaintiffs Satheesh Kannan \nMarimuthu, Muruganandam Arumugam, and Muralidharan Arumugam first saw the Texas Labor \nCamp, they thought it was a prison. \nIsolated Living Conditions \n132.  The Texas Labor Camp was located m iles away from  shopping, p laces of  \nworship, public transportation, or residen tial communities.  This re mote location was chosen \npurposefully by Signal to keep the P laintiffs and other foreign workers segregated from the rest \nof Orange, Texas.  In fact, Signalโs workers and management went so far as to refer to the Texas \nLabor Camp as a โreservation.โ \n133.  The Texas Labor Camp gates were m onitored by security guards retained by \nSignal.  Signalโs security guards required Plaintiffs to show employee identification badges and \nrecorded the time when Plaintiffs entered and  exited the Texas Labor Camp.  Signalโs security \nguards also searched Plaintiffsโ packages and bags when they entered the Texas Labor Camp. \n134.  The Indian workers were not perm itted to receive visitors in the Texas Labor \nCamp. \n135.  Signal did not require any of its non-Indian  employees to live in the s egregated \nโman camps.โ \nOvercrowded and Unsanitary Bunkhouses \n- 26 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 27 of 76 PageID #:  27\n136.  Signal packed up to 24 m en into each bunkhouse, in two-tiered bunk b eds.  The \nbunkhouse was so congested that it wa s difficult for workers to m ove about or even to sit up in \nbed, and any semblance of privacy was impossible. \n137.  Each of the bunkhouses contained workers who worked both day and night shifts, \nso Plaintiffs had dif ficulty sleeping due to th e constant noise and the com ings and goings of \nworkers from different shifts. \n138.  The bunkhouses contained insufficient toil ets and bathing facilities.  Each \nbunkhouse contained only one or two toilets, so Plai ntiffs had to endure long lines, unsanitary \nconditions, and plumbing problems.   \n139.  These conditions failed to m eet basic  requirements of habitability and, not \nsurprisingly, illness and disease were common. \nRotten Food \n140.  Food at the Texas Labor Ca mp was not readily available.  Plaintiffs had to eat at \nSignalโs mess halls, which were only open during  limited hours. If the Indian workers arrived \nlate for a meal, they were often denied food. \n141.  What food the Indian w orkers received was often rotten and cam e from kitchens \nthat were n ot hygienic.  As a resu lt, the Indi an workers frequently becam e ill and som etimes \nrequired hospita lization.  Plaintif f Rajendran   Sappani, for exam ple, suffered fr om regular \nstomach ailments as a result of the poor food that required medicine to treat. \n142.  Further, Sig nal refused  to accommodate re ligiously-based dietary restrictions.   \nFor example, Plaintiff Moorthy Madhamuni is a vegetarian by religion.  He explained to Signalโs \nrepresentatives the f act that his re ligion required him to eat vegetarian, but they refused to \nprovide vegetarian food.  Like wise, Plaintiff Murganandam  Arumugam was forced to choose \n- 27 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 28 of 76 PageID #:  28\nbetween eating food he was allergic to (lamb and goat), eating food which violated his religious \nbeliefs (beef and pork), or going hungry. \nSignal Charged Plaintiffs $1,050 per Month For These โAccommodationsโ \n143.  For the โprivilege โ of living in thes e deplorable conditions, Signal charged the \nIndian workers, including Plaintiffs, $35 pe r day (approxim ately $1,050 per m onth).  Signal \nfailed to inform most or all of the Plaintiffs of these fees during the recruitment process. \n144.  From this amount, $21 was allocated towards rent, and $14 towards food.  The fee \nwas deducted from Plaintiffsโ paychecks automatically with no ability to opt out. \n145.  Some of the Indian workers com plained of the disgusting living conditions and \nrequested to move out of the Texas Labor Cam p.  Initially, Signal simply refused.  Eventually, \nSignal told workers that if  they tried to live outside the Texas Labor  Camp, Signal would still \ndeduct the $35 per-day labor camp fees from their wages.  Given their already substantial debts, \nPlaintiffs had no reasonable choice but to con tinue living in the Texas Labor Camp.  Whil e \nPlaintiffs were forced to pay these exorbitant  fees becaus e they had no reasonab le financial \nalternative, Signal made over $730,000 in profit from the Mississippi and Texas man camps in \njust one year. \n146.  Upon information and belief, Signal charge d Plaintiffsโ room and board in order \nto recoup the cost of building  the man camps.  So anxious was Signal to recoup those expenses, \nthat it even charged Plaintiff Muruganandam Arumugam for room and board while he was in the \nhospital recovering from an e mergency surgery.  Signal did not require non-Indian workers to \nlive at the Texas Labor Camp or to pay similar room and board expenses. \nContinuous, Abusive, and Discriminatory Supervision \n- 28 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 29 of 76 PageID #:  29\n147.  Plaintiffs felt compelled to rem ain at the Tex as Labor Cam p, in part, because \nSignal created an environment of fear through constant, abusive, and discriminatory supervision. \n148.  Signalโs personnel and/or security guards  deprived Plaintiffs of any sense of  \nprivacy by conducting surprise searches of  the bunkhouse, searching workerโs personal \nbelongings, and even occasionally requiring that the Indian workers turn out their pockets.  Upon \ninformation and belief, non-Indian workers were not subject to similar treatment. \n149.  As stated above, Signalโs security guards monitored Plaintiffs and required them \nto show id entification whenever th ey entered and exited the Texas L abor Camp and tracked  \nPlaintiffโs movements in and out of the camp.  Upon information and belief, non-Indian workers \nwere not subject to similar treatment. \n150.  Plaintiffs were subjected to โno visito rsโ and โno alcoholโ policies at the Texas \nLabor Camp.  Violation subjected the worker s to fines and suspension of work.  Upon \ninformation and belief, non-Indian workers were not subject to similar policies. \n151.  As stated above, Signal requ ired Plaintiffs and other  Indian workers to set up \ndirect deposit bank accounts upon arrival to the Texas Labor Camp, to which Signal maintained \naccess.  Plaintiffs reaso nably believed Signal c ould exert influence over  Plaintiffโs financial \narrangements.  Upon infor mation and belief, non -Indian workers were not subject to sim ilar \nrequirements. \n152.  The Indian workers, in cluding Plaintiffs, were often given m ore difficult and \ndangerous jobs than the other non-Indian Signal  workers.  They wer e required to clean their \nequipment after work hours, while non-Indian workers were permitted to clean their equipment \nduring the last 30 m inutes of their shift.  Indian  workers were forced to take rep eated โskills \n- 29 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 30 of 76 PageID #:  30\ntestsโ that non-Indian workers  were not required to take.   And non-Indian w orkers were \npermitted to work more overtime hours than the Indian workers. \n153.  Signalโs personnel and superv isors frequently used offensive language while \nspeaking with or referring to Plaintiffs and ot her Indian workers, including making anti-Indian \ncomments. \n154.  Signal threatened Plaintiffs and other Indian workers with deportation or adverse \nemployment actions if they di d not continue w orking for Signa l, did not work according to \nSignalโs sp ecifications, or com plained about  the working and living conditio ns.  Upon \ninformation and belief, workers of non-Indian race,  ethnicity, and alienage were not treated this \nway. \nDefendantsโ Continued Misrepresentations, Omissions, and Coercive Conduct \n155.  At meetings with Signal personnel, Indi an workers voiced com plaints regarding \nthe discriminatory treatment to which they were being subjected.  When Signal did not respond \nto the workers complaints, Indian workers a t the Mississippi Labor Ca mp began m eeting to \ndiscuss how to persuade Signal to improve conditions at the camp, and began meeting with third \nparties to discuss how to address their concerns. \n156.  Upon inform ation and belief, Sig nal becam e aware of these m eetings and \ncontacted the Agents to express concern about worker organizing efforts.  Upon information and \nbelief, Defendants reached an agreem ent regarding steps to be taken to quell further worker \norganization efforts. \n157.  On March 8, 2007, Signal m anagement me t with Indian workers at the \nMississippi Labor Camp and inform ed them that it would fight back ag ainst any โorganizingโ \n- 30 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 31 of 76 PageID #:  31\nefforts, and that Signal would not extend any of th e workersโ H-2B visas if a single worker took \nlegal action against Signal. \n158.  On March 9, 2007, Signal took five of th e more vocal Indian workers at the \nMississippi Labor Camp into โcu stody,โ fired them , and infor med them that they would be \ndeported.  Distraught at what that meant for him and his family, one of the workers attempted to \ncommit suicide. \n159.  Later that same day, Plaintiffs learned about the events at the Mississippi Labor \nCamp.  Plaintiffs and other Indi an workers becam e frightened by  these activities, particula rly \nwhen word spread  th at Sign al h ad im prisoned Ind ian workers  in Miss issippi who had \ncomplained about the working conditions and that  one worker attempted suicide rather than be \ndeported and face the debts that he had incurred in India in order to come to Signal. \n160.  Plaintiffs reasonably feared that if they tried to  leave Signalโs employ or oppose \nthe conditions at the Texas Labor Cam p, including by consulting with counsel, Plaintiffs would \nface forced deportation, physical restraint and detention, or other serious harms and/or abuses of \nthe legal process at the hands of Signal. \n161.  In addition, throughout the spring and  summer of 2007, S ignal representatives \nheld meetings with Plaintiffs and other workers to discuss the status of Plaintiffs and other Indian \nworkersโ visas.  Through its agents, Signal continued to represent that it would arrange for H-2B \nvisa extensions.  At no point during these m eetingsโindeed, at no point prior to term inationโ\nwere Plaintiffs informed that they would not be receiving green cards. \n162.  Signal was, in fact, evaluating the work ers, including Plaintiffs, and had no \nintention of applying for visa extensions for all of the workers or applying for green cards for the \nworkers. \n- 31 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 32 of 76 PageID #:  32\n163.  At various tim es, Signal refused to c onfirm whether it ha d obtained visa \nextensions for Plaintiffs.  As a result, Pla intiffs felt further compelled to continue to work f or \nSignal and live at the T exas Labor Ca mp.  U pon information and belief, Signal prevented or \nattempted to prevent Indian wo rkers, including Plaintiffs, from  consulting with lawyers about \ntheir situations. \n164.  Despite many promises to do so, Defenda nts never provided the green cards or \npermanent residency.  In fact, no Defendant ever ev en applied for a green card for any Plaintiff.   \nAnd, despite contractual provisions that clearly require them to do so, Defendants have failed to \nrefund any of the money Plaintiffs paid to them for green card and visa processing. \nPlaintiffs Relied on Defendantsโ Representations \nSatheesh Kannan Marimuthu \n165.  In or around Septem ber 2006, while worki ng as a fitter in Singapore, Satheesh \nKannan Marim uthu (โSatheeshโ) le arned of an opportunity to work in the United States.   \nSpecifically, Satheesh s aw advertisements in three n ewspapers, Dinamalar, Dhinathanthi and \nThe Hindu, stating that fitters and welders were needed in the United States.  The advertisements \nfurther stated that applicants would be eligib le for a visa and a green card and  instructed \ninterested parties to contact Dewan. \n166.  In or around December 2006, Satheesh called Dewan, who confirmed that he was \nassisting in the hiring of  fitters and welders for positions in the United States.  During this call \nDewan explained that Satheesh would need to take a test at De Silva Engineering and that if he \npassed, he would get in an interview and that Dewan would begin processing his H-2B visa and \ngreen card.  Dewan also said there would be a  service charge of eight lakhs (approxim ately \n$18,000). \n- 32 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 33 of 76 PageID #:  33\n167.  Satheesh called Dewan twice in January  2007 to confirm  that there w as a job \nvacancy for him and that he would  get a g reen card.  Sath eesh explained that he h ad a stable \nwell-paying job in Singapore that he was unwilling to relinquish unless he had a job and a green \ncard lined up. Dewan told Satheesh that it was  one hundred percent certain that Satheesh would \nreceive a green card and that Sa theesh should not pass up the rare  opportunity to move to the \nUnited States with his family.  Dewan stated that Pol and Burnett would work to ensure Satheesh \nreceived a green card. \n168.  Only after Dewan promised a green card and the fitter job in the United States did \nSatheesh resign his fitter job in Singapore.  \n169.  In January 2007, Satheesh returned to I ndia to take the test at De Silva  \nEngineering.  At this  time, Dewan stated tha t Satheesh n eeded to p ay the eight-lakh servic e \ncharge and make two demand drafts of $5,000 eac hโone payable to Michael Pol and the o ther \npayable to Malvern Burnett. Dewan stated that th e demand drafts were to cov er attorneysโ fees \nand that this payment would ensure Satheesh received a green card.   \n170.  After Satheesh passed the test at De Silva Engineering, Dewan and his employee, \nSalimon, informed Satheesh that he also needed to pay $1,000 for visa stam ping at the embassy \nand an additional $400 for โm edical feesโ before  he could begin working in the U nited States.  \nSatheesh was instructed to contact Salimon only after he had compiled the necessary funds.  \n171.  To compile the funds demanded by Dewan, Satheesh was forced to pawn family \njewelry, borrow $10,000 at a high  interest rate from  private  lenders, and withdraw his lif e \nsavings of $4,000. \n172.  After Satheesh notified Salimon that he had funds sufficient to pay the recruiting \nfees, Salimon instru cted Satheesh to com e to hi s office in Chennai, India to m ake the first \n- 33 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 34 of 76 PageID #:  34\npayment of $1,000, which Satheesh  did.  Salimon  accepted the money on behalf of Dewan and \nagain confirm ed that Satheesh  would receive a  green card in exchange for the paym ent.  \nSatheesh requested a receipt for his payment, which Salimon refused to provide.   \n173.  After receiving the payment from Satheesh, S alimon filled out th e paperwork \nSalimon stated was necessary for visa processing and notified Satheesh that he was scheduled for \nan interview at the United States Consulate in  Chennai about three days later. Salim on called \nSatheesh two days after the interview to inform him that Satheeshโs visa had been approved and \nthat Salimon was holding Satheeshโs passport.   \n174.  Salimon eventually notif ied Satheesh that  his flight to the United States would \nleave from Mumbai on February 15, 2007.  Sath eesh was instructed to bring funds for the \nremaining recruitm ent fees to Dewanโs office.   W hen he arrived, Dewan took Satheeshโs \npayment, but again refused to provide receipts.  Only after taking the payment did Dewan return \nSatheeshโs passport. \n175.  Satheesh departed India for the United  States on February 15, 2007.  A Signal \nemployee picked Satheesh and others up from  the airport in Houston, Texas and brought them \ndirectly to the Texas Labor Ca mp.  Satheesh thought the labor camp was a prison the first tim e \nhe saw it.  \n176.  Prior to re ceiving Satheeshโs payments, Dewan and Salimon represented that \nSatheesh would be living in an apartment with two to three other workers when he arrived in the \nUnited States.  Dewan and Salim on represented that Satheeshโs living conditions in the United \nStates would be as good as, or better than, hi s living conditions in Singapore.  A s discussed \nabove, the living conditions were far from what was promised. \n- 34 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 35 of 76 PageID #:  35\n177.  In addition, Signal supervisors regularl y made racial and ridiculing comm ents \nabout the Indian workers, including Satheesh, and gave the most  difficult and dangerous jobs to \nIndian workers.   \n178.  Signal employees further threatened that if Satheesh left the labor camp he would \nbe fired and that Signal would stop processi ng his immigration status.  Because of these \nstatements, and his debt in India, Satheesh felt  trapped, that could leave the Texas L abor Camp, \nand that he could not leave Signalโs employ. \n179.  In March 2007, Signal held a m eeting at which Satheesh and other workers were \ntold that they had to stay in  the labor camp and that they c ould only eat the food cooked at the \ncamp.  Signal representatives stated that anyone who did not comply with these rules would lose \ntheir job and be deported. \n180.  In April 2007, Signal held another m eeting, during which they notified Satheesh \nand others that only som e of  the workers would have their visa s renewed.  Signal stated that \nthose workers whose visas had not been renewed would be deported.   \n181.  Because Signal and Dewan frequently represented that Michael Pol and Malvern \nBurnett were Satheeshโs lawyers for immigration matters, Satheesh requested to speak with  \nand/or meet with Mich ael Pol and  Malvern Burn ett.  Sig nal employees refused, stating th at \nSatheeshโs request would violate company policy. \n182.  Defendants have never returned any of  the โrecru itment feesโ incurred by  \nSatheesh and never provided a green card for Satheesh or his family. \n183.  Satheesh relied upon D efendantsโ promises of perm anent residency, long-term \nemployment, and good working c onditions.  He would not have in curred subs tantial debt,  \nrelinquished prior em ployment, or agreed to wo rk for Si gnal in the absence of such false \n- 35 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 36 of 76 PageID #:  36\npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal wou ld attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees, Satheesh felt in timidated into acqu iescence and compelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \nBalamurugan Marimuthu \n184.  Balagmurgan Marimuthu (โMarimuthuโ) is from Trichy, India.  In or around \nAugust 2006, he saw an advertisem ent for a job  opportunity for welders and fitters in the \nnewspaper Dinamalar. \n185.  Interested in the possibility of additional income, Marimuthu traveled to Chennai, \nIndia to interview for the position.  At the interview, Pol and Dewan told Marimuthu he must pay \n20,000 rupees (approxim ately $450) as an interv iew fee and for a m edical exam ination.  \nMarimuthu declined to pay the fee. \n186.  Shortly after the interview, howeve r, Marimuthu saw a second advertisem ent in \nDinamalar.  The advertisem ent promised employment in the United S tates and green cards for  \nthe workers and their families.  Marimuthu was extremely interested in the possibility of working \nin the United States and receiving green cards for himself and his family. \n187.  The advertisem ent indicated that inte rested applicants should appear on \nNovember 8, 9, or 10 at De Silva  Engineering in Chennai, India  for an interview.  Marimuthu \nagain travelled to Chennai and interviewed on November 8, 2006. \n188.  At the interview, Marimuthu learned th at the job opportunity was with Signal \nInternational.  Pol, Dewan, Burnett, and repr esentatives from Signal attend ed this inte rview \nsession, along with 40 to 50 potential workers. \n- 36 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 37 of 76 PageID #:  37\n189.  During the interview, Pol and Burnett asked Marim uthu about his previous work \nexperience.  Marim uthu explained his prior work experience in  Singapore, and described the \naccommodations, food, and benefits that were  provided by the em ployer. Pol and Burnett \npromised that Signal would provide the sam e type of accommodations, food, and benefits.   \nConsistent with the  advertisement, Pol and  Burnett also promised that Signal w ould provide \ngreen cards for Marimuthu, his wife, and his daughter. \n190.  Subsequently, one of Signalโs representatives administered a test to Marimuthu to \ndetermine his capabilities as a fitter, which Marimuthu passed. \n191.  After he passed the test, Dewan and his employee, Salimon, informed Marimuthu \nand the other workers who passed the test that  they would enter the United S tates on an H-2B  \nvisa and would be processed for a green card once they arrived in the United States. \n192.  Dewan then told the workers that th is opportunity w ould cost 8 lakhs \n(approximately $18,000) and represented that this  fee would be used for processing of the  \nworkersโ green cards. \n193.  Dewan told Marimuthu he would have to make an initial deposit of 35,000 rupees \n(approximately $787), and then pay Pol and Burn ett $5,373 each by dem and draft.  Marimuthu \nunderstood that Burnett was an American lawyer that was assisting him with obtaining his green \ncard, among other things. \n194.  Based on the rep resentations from  Dewan, Pol, and B urnett, including the \nrepresentations about receiving a green card for  himself and his family, Marimuthu was willing \nto pay the required recruitm ent fees.  To  that end, on Novem ber 14, 2006, Marim uthu paid \napproximately 35,000 rupees he had saved from his work in Singapore. \n- 37 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 38 of 76 PageID #:  38\n195.  Marimuthu knew he would need to interv iew at the United States Cons ulate to \nwork for Signal.  He asked Dewan when his inte rview with the Consulate would be, but he was \ntold he first had to pay an additional two lakhs (approximately $4,500). \n196.  Marimuthu did not have enough m oney to pay the additional fee and believed it \nwould take him about three years to earn one la kh in India.  As a result, he borrowed m oney \nfrom his father and a Tamil Nadu society.  As collateral for the latter loan, Marimuthu provided \nhis wifeโs jewelry (despite deep sentimental and cultural value). \n197.  Marimuthu also borrowed four lakhs (approximately $9,000) from his uncle at a \nsignificant monthly interest rate.  As collateral, Marimuthu offered title to his house.  Marimuthu \nonly agreed to these terms because he believed he would be able  to pay his uncle back quickly \nonce Marimuthu arrived in the United States. \n198.  Pol and Burnett scheduled Marimuthuโs interview at the Consulate for December \n4, 2006 in Chennai. \n199.  Prior to the interview, on Dece mber 3, 2006, Salimon meet with Marimuthu and \ncoached him on what to say during the interview. \n200.  Marimuthu attended the Consulate interv iew on December 4 and was approved \nfor a visa.  The Consulate inform ed Marimuthu that his passport would be sent to his hom e by \ncourier and gave Marimuthu a courier receipt. \n201.  After the interview, Marimuthu met Salimon at a hotel in Chennai.  Salimon took \nMarimuthuโs paperwork, including the courier receipt for the passport.  Salimon told Marimuthu \nhe would keep Marimuthuโs passport, and that he  would call when the visa in the passport was \nstamped.  Salimon did not return Marimuthuโs passport after it was stamped with the visa. \n- 38 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 39 of 76 PageID #:  39\n202.  On December 8, 2006, Salim on instructed Marimuthu to take out dem and drafts \nfor Pol and Burnett.  Salim on also inf ormed Marimuthu his f light to the United  States was \nbooked for December 13, 2006. \n203.  Believing that he would receive a green  card for him self and his fa mily, \nMarimuthu obtained tw o demand drafts payable to Pol and Burnett, each in the a mount of \n$5,373.00 (upon information and belief, these dem and drafts were required to be paid in Unite d \nStates dollars).  Marimuthu wrote in the memo line of the drafts โgreen card fees.โ   He paid an  \nadditional six lakhs (approximately $13,500) to Dewan in cash. \n204.  Two days before leaving for Chennai, Salimon contacted Marimuthu and told him \nhe would need to arrange and pa y for his travel from  Trichy to  Chennai, as well as pay for \nmedical testing.  Marimuthu had not been previously informed that he would be responsible for \nthese travel and m edical fees, which totale d about 15,000 rupees (a pproximately $337).   \nMarimuthu told Salim on he did not believe he  should have to pay these fees.  S alimon told \nMarimuthu that if he did not, Signal would cancel his flight to the United States and Marimuthu \nwould forfeit the payments he had already made.  Marimuthu felt threatened, and he worried that \nhe might lose his money and the opportunity to work in the United States on a green card.  As a \nresult, he received a last-minute loan from a distant relative for the additional 15,000 rupees. \n205.  On December 12, 2006, Marim uthu travelled to Chennai.  From  there, Salimon \ngave Marimuthu a plane ticket to Mumbai. \n206.  When he arrived at Dewanโs office in Mumbai, Marimuthu attempted to negotiate \nwith Dewan about reducing his recruitment fees, instead of charging the full eight lakhs.  Dewan \nthreatened to cancel Marimuthuโs plane ticket if he did not pay the full amount. \n- 39 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 40 of 76 PageID #:  40\n207.  Fearful that he would forfeit the money he had already paid and the opportunity to \nreceive a green card, M arimuthu made the final pa yments.  He also paid an additional fee of \n2,500 rupees (approximately $56) f or a m edical certificate that S ignal said he would need to \nenter the U nited States.  Af ter these paym ents, Marimuthu was f orced to sign several f orms, \nwhich were in English, without adequate time to read and understand the forms. \n208.  On December 13, 2006, Marim uthu traveled from  Mumbai to Houston, Texas.   \nUpon arriving in Houston, a Signal representative  drove Marimuthu to the Texas L abor Camp.  \nAs described above, the conditions at the la bor camp were horrid.  Marim uthu was shocked \nbecause he had been promised that the living conditions while working for Signal would be the \nsame as those he described in Singapore. \n209.  Marimuthu felt compelled to rem ain at the Texas Labor Ca mp and work for  \nSignal because of the d ebt he had incurred to p ay the recruiting fees and because he believed \nthat, if he did so, Signal would obtain a green card for him and his family.   \n210.  Marimuthu also felt compelled to remain at the Texas Labor Cam p and work for \nSignal, because Signalโs employees and representatives threatened to deport workers if they did \nnot do their jobs properly or if they tried to leave Signal. \n211.  In September 2007, Signal held a m eeting for the workers.  Signal told the \nworkers that they were going to apply for one more H-2B visa extension, but that they would not \nbe receiving the prom ised green c ards.  This  was the f irst time that Signal ev er informed \nMarimuthu that it was not providing the promised green cards. \n212.  True to form, neither Signal nor any of  the other Defendants ever provided or \napplied for a green card for Marimuthu or his fa mily.  Nor did they ev er return any of the \nrecruitment fees incurred by Marimuthu. \n- 40 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 41 of 76 PageID #:  41\n213.  Marimuthu relied upon Defendantsโ prom ises of permanent residency, long-term \nemployment, and good working c onditions.  He would not have in curred subs tantial debt,  \nrelinquished prior em ployment, or agreed to wo rk for Si gnal in the absence of such false \npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal wou ld attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees, Marimuthu felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \nMuruganandam Arumugam \n214.  In or around May 2006, Muruganandam  Arumugam (โMuruganandamโ) learned \nof advertisem ents in two newspapers,  Dinathandhi and   The Hindu , stating that fitters and \nwelders were being recruited to w ork in the  United States.  The a dvertisements instructed \ninterested parties to contact Sachin Dewan and his company Dewan Consultants. \n215.  Muruganandam was working as a welder in Singapore, but he was excited about \nthe opportunity to live and work in the United St ates.  He contacted Dewan.  De wan informed \nhim that welding jobs were available in the United States and that Dewan could help him secure \nsuch a position.  Dewan told Muruganandam  that he would need to pass  a welding test at De \nSilva Institute before he would be considered for any positions. \n216.  Muruganandam traveled over 800 kilom eters on four separate occasions to \nparticipate in the we lder recruitment process.  During one of these trips, Muruganandam  met \nwith Pol, Burnett and Dewan.  At this m eeting, Muruganandam was inform ed that, if he was \nselected, he would definitely receive a green car d after he was hired for the welding job in the \nUnited States.  He was al so repeatedly assured that his family would eventu ally be able to join \n- 41 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 42 of 76 PageID #:  42\nhim in the United States and that his living conditions in the United States would be better than \nin Singapore, where Muruganandam lived in a private apartment with his wife and kids. \n217.  Dewan also told Muruganandam  that he w ould have to pay a service charge of \neight lakhs (approxim ately $18,000)  to Dewan Consultants to secure a green card and the \nwelding job in the United States.  Of this  amount, 35,000 rupees was due as a deposit before \nDewan would arrange the necessary interview with the United States Consulate in Chennai. \n218.  After Muruganandam passed his welding test s, he was instructed to wait two to  \nthree months for a phone call from Dewan, which would inform him that it was time to interview \nat the U.S. Consulate.  During  this time Muruganandam returned to  his stable welding job in  \nSingapore which paid 750 Singapore dollars per week (approximately $540). \n219.  Eventually, Muruganandam was inform ed that it was tim e to return to India to  \nparticipate in the Consulate interview.  Muruganandam was instructed to bring the initial deposit \nof 35,000 rupeesโnearly his entire life savings โto Chennai.  As instructed, Muruganandam \npaid the money to Dewan, Burnett, and Pol. \n220.  After that meeting, Dewanโs employee, Salimon, provided Muruganandam  with \npaperwork to bring to the Cons ulate for the interv iew he arranged.  During the interview, \nMuruganandam was informed that he could not get a visa through the Consulate in India because \nhe was a permanent resident of Singapore.  Mu ruganandam relayed this information to Dewan, \nwho informed him that he would need to make an additional deposit of 165,000 rupees ($3,712) \nin order to continue the process.  \n221.  To com pile the funds dem anded by Dewan, Muruganandam  had to borrow \n165,000 rupees from  his m other-in-law.  In  late November 2006, Muruganandam  paid this  \nmoney to Salimon in Chennai.  Salim on provided additional documentation to Muruganandam \n- 42 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 43 of 76 PageID #:  43\nand instructed him to attend an inte rview at the U.S. Consulate in Singapore, which eventuall y \ngranted Muruganandam a visa. \n222.  Because Muruganandam could not complete the welding tests, meet with Dewan \nand Signalโs agents, and attend interviews at  consulates in India and Singapore while also \nworking a full tim e job, he was forced to relin quish a stable, well-paying job in S ingapore to \npursue the position with Signal.   \n223.  Salimon instructed Muruganandam to gather the remaining 600,000 rupees.  To \ndo so, Muruganandam was forced to borrow the additional funds from his mother-in-law. \n224.  When Muruganandam notified Salimon that he had the 600,000 rupees, Salim on \ninstructed him to get on a plane from Chennai  to Mumbai, which was leaving in a m atter of \nhours, and to report to Dewanโs office. \n225.  Once in Mumbai, Muruganandam went to Dewanโs office as instructed.  While in \na sm all room , surrounded by  several intim idating people who worked for Dewan, \nMuruganandam paid the additional rupees to Dewan.  He also signed various documents written \nin English that he did not understand. \n226.  Only after Muruganandam paid the 600,000 rupees did Dewan give \nMuruganandamโs passport back to him .  De wan then provided Muruganandam  with a plane \nticket to the United States which was scheduled to leave in a matter of hours. \n227.  Murganandam departed India for the United States on February 1, 2007.  A Signal \nemployee drove Murganandam and others from th e airport in Houston, Texas directly to the \nTexas Labor Camp.  The first time he saw it, Murganandam thought the labor camp was a prison. \n228.  Dewan had represented that Murgana ndamโs liv ing con ditions in  the United  \nStates would be as good as, or better than, hi s living conditions in Singapore.  A s described \n- 43 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 44 of 76 PageID #:  44\nabove, however, the living conditions were reprehensible, and Murganandam was forced to live \nin one of the labor campโs crowded trailers. \n229.  As Signal was using two or three traile rs in the Labor Ca mp for  storage, \nMurganandam and other workers asked if the equipment could be moved to allow the workers to \nspread out and have more sanitary living conditions.  Signal refused to move the equipment and \nlocked the trailer doors to prevent the workers fr om using the additional bathrooms and beds in \nthe storage trailers.   \n230.  Because Signal often served spoiled  food, or ran out of fish or chicken options,  \nMurganandam was forc ed to choose between eating food he was allergic to (lamb and goat), \neating food which violated his religious beliefs (beef and pork), or going hungry. \n231.  Signal supervisors also tr eated Indian workers, including Murganandam , far \nworse than the non-Indian workers.  For instance, the foreman regularly allowed the non-Indian \nworkers to clean their equipment during the final thirty minutes the workers were scheduled to \nwork each day.  Conversely, the Indian workers were required to clean their tools every day after \ntheir shift had ended, which amounted to approximately thirty minutes of unpaid work each day.  \nSimilarly, the fore man allowed the non-Indian wo rkers to work overtim e far m ore frequently \nthan the Indian workers. \n232.  Signal employees threatened that if Murganandam left the labor camp on his own \nhe would be fired and that Signal would stop pr ocessing his immigration status.  Based on these \nstatements and his deb t in Ind ia, Murganandam felt trapped.  He f elt that h e could leave the \nTexas Labor Camp or Signalโs employ. \n233.  Signal informed Murganandam that he could live outside of the Labor C amp, but \nthat he would still be responsible for paying  for the housing and food provided at the Labor \n- 44 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 45 of 76 PageID #:  45\nCamp.  Murganandam  was never infor med that  Signal would charge him  for food or housing \nbefore he left India. \n234.  Signal only provided infrequent m eetings for em ployees to express their \ngrievances.  Nevertheless, Murganandam  could  not attend these m eetings because they were  \nalways conducted at 5:00 p.m., during Murganandamโs work shift.  Moreover, the meetings were \nineffectual for workers like Murganandam , because they were conducted in English and no \ntranslator was provided. \n235.  When Murganandam and a friend inquired  about the status of their visas and \ngreen cards, a Signal representative declined to discuss their status.  When Muruganandam called \nBurnett to discuss the status of his visa and green card, Burnett refused to return his calls. \n236.  Defendants have never returned any of  the โrecru itment feesโ incurred by  \nMurganandam and have never provided a green card for Murganandam or his family. \n237.  Murganandam relied upon Defendantsโ pr omises of perm anent residency, long-\nterm employment, and good working condition s.  He would not have incurred sub stantial debt, \nrelinquished prior em ployment, or agreed to wo rk for Si gnal in the absence of such false \npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal wou ld attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees, Murganandam felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled \nto continue working for Signal. \nMuralidharan Arumugam \n238.  In or around March 2006, Muralidhara n Arum ugam (โMuralidharanโ) saw \nadvertisements in two local newspapers for weld ing and fitting jobs in the United States.  The \nadvertisements indicated that interested parties should contact Dewan Consultants. \n- 45 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 46 of 76 PageID #:  46\n239.  Around July 2006, Muralidharan attended a  meeting at Dewan Consultants.   \nSachin Dewan ran the m eeting with the assistan ce of Salimon, Pol and Burnett.  During this \nmeeting Muralidharan and the other attendees were advised that Signal had fitting and welding \njobs available in the United States.   The atte ndees were advised that  whoever secured a job \nwould earn $18 per hour for 50 hours of work  per week, that food and lodging would be \nprovided, and that each worker would get a g reen card.  To  be considered for these positions, \nMuralidharan and the other attendees would  need to pass perform ance tests and pay \napproximately six lakhs (approximately $13,500). \n240.  Encouraged by the prospect of working  in the United States, Muralidharan took \nand passed the requisite tests right after the initial meeting at Dewan Consultants.  \n241.  Sachin Dewan said he would schedule a  visa interview for Muralidharan at the \nU.S. Consulate as soon as Muralidharan paid 1.5 lakhs (approximately $3,375). \n242.  In order to m eet Dewanโs demand, Mu ralidharan m ortgaged his fa milyโs \nagricultural land against his fatherโs wishes.  Muralidharan used the money he raised to pay 1.5 \nlakhs to Dewan for his Consulate interview. \n243.  Muralidharan successfully completed his Consulate interview around Novem ber \n2006.  Muralidharan prom ptly notified Dewan that  he had passed and that he was ready to \ncontinue with the process. \n244.  In or aroun d Decem ber 2006, Mu ralidharan attended a second m eeting with \nDewan Consultants.  D uring this meeting Muralidharan learned that the  cost to work in the  \nUnited States had increased to eight lakhs (app roximately $18,000), rather than the six lakhs he \nwas originally quoted. \n- 46 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 47 of 76 PageID #:  47\n245.  At the same meeting, Dewan told Muralidharan that he needed to pay a second \ndeposit of $10,746 towards this am ount in the form of two $5,373 dem and draftsโone payable \nto Pol and the other payable to Burnett.  Dewa n represented that these paym ents would ensure \nthat Muralidharan received a green card, which would enable him to perm anently live and work \nin the United States.  After receiv ing a letter  that confirmed he would receiv e a green card,  \nMuralidharan paid the second deposit of $10,476 on December 9, 2006. \n246.  To compile the funds demanded by Dewan, including the second deposit and the \nremaining amounts owed on the eight lakhs, Muralidharan mortgaged his fatherโs house, pawned \nhis wifeโs jewelry and took out private loans. \n247.  As soon as Muralidharan com piled the necessary funds, he traveled to Mum bai \nand paid the remaining portion of the eight la khs charged by Dewan.  After Muralidharan paid, \nDewan returned his passport and provided him with plane tickets for a flight to the United States \nthat departed the next day. \n248.  Muralidharan departed India for the Un ited States on or about December 11, \n2006.  A Signal em ployee drove Mura lidharan and others from  the airport in Houston, Texas \ndirectly to the Texas Labor Camp.  The first time he saw it, Muralidharan thought the camp was \na prison. \n249.  Prior to rec eiving his first paycheck, Muralidharan was not aware that Signal \nwould deduct money for room and board. \n250.  As described above, the liv ing conditions at the camp were reprehensible.  As a \nresult of over-crowding, unsanitary conditions,  and spoiled food, nume rous workers, including \nMuralidharan, became ill seriously while living in Signalโs Texas Labor Camp.   \n- 47 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 48 of 76 PageID #:  48\n251.  Muralidharan contracted an intestinal vi rus or in fection while liv ing at Signalโs \nTexas Labor Camp and had to have e mergency surgery.  Muralidharan rem ained bedridden in \nthe hospital for four days following the surgery.   Muralidharan departed from the hospital early \nbecause he could not afford to stay as long  as he was advised to stay.  Mulihandharan โs \nhospitalization resulted in charges exceeding $30,000. \n252.  Nonetheless, Signal continued to  charge Muralidharan for food and \naccommodations while he was in the hospital, unable to work. \n253.  As a result of the debt he had incurred to  pay the recruiting fees and the fees for \nhis hospitalization, as well as the promise of a green card, Muralidharan felt compelled to remain \nat Signal. \n254.  Defendants have never returned any of  the โrecru itment feesโ incurred by  \nMuralidharan and have never provided a green card for Muralidharan or his family. \n255.  Muralidharan relied upon Defenda ntsโ promises of per manent residency, long-\nterm employment, and good working condition s.  He would not have incurred sub stantial debt, \nmortgaged his familyโs land, or agreed to work for Signal in the absence of such false promises.  \nBecause of his fear that Signal  would attempt to deport him, his  fear of mistreatment and abuse \nby Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his fa mily had incurred to pay \nDefendantsโ recruiting fees, Muralidharan felt in timidated into acquies cence and compelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \nSatyanarayana Ellapu \n256.  In or around June 2006, while working as a  structural welder in Andhra Pradesh, \nIndia, Satyanarayana Ellapu (โSatyaโ) saw an advertisement in the local newspaper, Eenadu, for \npotential employment in the United States.  The advertisement stated that a โleading marine and \n- 48 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 49 of 76 PageID #:  49\nfabrication company in Mississippi and Texasโ was hiring welders and pipefitters for its facilities \nin the United States and was conducting tests on June 25, 26, and 28, 2006, for the positions. \n257.  The advertisem ent also stated th at the positions m ay include โperm anent \nemployment visasโ and a โ2 years [sic] contract.โ \n258.  Satya was hopeful that the job opportunity would better enable him to provide for \nhis family, for whom he was the sole breadwinner. \n259.  On June 26, 2006, Satya traveled  an hour from his village to a training center to \ntake a test to determ ine his eligib ility for hire at Signal.  Sachin Dewan and other S ignal \nrepresentatives were present at this  meeting, along with 20 to 30 other welders an d pipefitters.  \nSatya passed the test and was instructed to return in three days. \n260.  Three days  later, Satya return ed to the training cen ter an atte nded an \ninformational m eeting with approxim ately 50  other workers.  Dewan and Burnett led the \nmeeting.  Dewan inform ed the workers that th e opportunities were for position s in Signalโs \nfacilities in Mississippi or Texas.  Dewan furthe r informed the workers that they would receive \nan H-2B visa for the first 9 months of their employment with Signal, but that they would then be \nprovided a green card.  Dewan indicated that the  process would take four to six months and \nwould cost six lakhs (approximately $13,500), of which one lakh (approximately $2,250) had to \nbe paid up front. \n261.  Satya complained about the cost to Dewan and Burnett.  They informed Satya that \nhe had no choiceโโIf you want the job, you have to pay.โ  However, they also promised that the \nmoney would be โeasily recoveredโ once Satya began working in the United States. \n262.  In response to the workersโ concern a bout the size of th e up-front paym ent, \nDewan and Burnett stated that the workers could pay 20,000 rupees (approximately $450) within \n- 49 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 50 of 76 PageID #:  50\n20 days and pay the balance later.  If the m en paid the 20,000 rupees, they would be guaranteed \nthe job. \n263.  Dewan and Burnett then distributed applications explaining that the worker had to \npay the recruiting fees in installments by demand drafts and cash. \n264.  After the meeting, Satya returned to his village to discuss the opportunity with his \nfamily.  His fa mily did not have enough m oney cover the recruiting fees , but they nonetheless \nencouraged him to applyโbelieving that a green card would assist Satya in providing for them. \n265.  Because Satyaโs life savings totaled one lakh, he borrowed four and a half lakhs \n(approximately $10,125) from a lender with interest.   As collateral, Satya pledged his fatherโs \nancestral land and his hom e, which the lender  threatened to repossess if Satya m issed any \npayments. \n266.  On July 20, 2006, Sat ya met with an e mployee of Dewan to m ake his first \npayment of 20,000 rupees.  The employee gave Satya  four forms to sign.  The first form was for \nGlobal and explained the payment schedule and amounts.  The second form was for Burnett and \nexplained the attorneysโ fees for legal services, employment agreements, and labor certifications.  \nThe third form explained Dewanโs services.  Th e fourth form was an em ployment agreement \nwith Signal.  Satya signed the four forms, trusting that Dewan had accurately translated them. \n267.  Subsequently, Satya had several m eetings with Dewanโs empl oyees in which he \nwas asked to m ake additional payments, including fees for visa pro cessing, bank drafts, and \ntravel and accommodation in Chennai, where he interviewed with the United States Consulate. \n268.  Prior to Satyaโs interview with th e Consulate on Nove mber 3, 2006, Dewan \ncontacted him and requested that he bring documents evidencing his land or inheritance, which \nDewan claimed was necessary for the visa application.  Satya traveled to Chennai and m et with \n- 50 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 51 of 76 PageID #:  51\nDewan two days before his interview with the Consulate. During this meeting, Dewan instructed \nSatya regarding what to say during the Consulate interview. \n269.  After the Consulate granted Satyaโs visa , Dewan contacted Satya and infor med \nhim that he could leave for the United States as  soon as he m ade a final paym ent of six lakhs \n(approximately $13,500).  Satya also had to borrow the funds necessary to make that payment. \n270.  On December 12, 2006,  Satya trav eled to Mumbai to pick up his passport and \nplane ticket from Dewanโs office.  After colle cting Satyaโs fee paym ents, Dewan gave Satya a \nseries of forms in English to sign.  Satya aske d for a translation, but Dewan refused, citing th e \nworkersโ imminent plane departure.  Satya believed he had no choice but to sign the for ms even \nthough he could not read them. \n271.  After he signed the forms, Satya was given his plane ticket and passport.  Satyaโs \nplane left Mumbai shortly thereafter and arrived in Houston,  Texas on or about Decem ber 13, \n2006.  A Signal representative met Satya and other workers at the airport and drove them to the \nTexas Labor Camp. \n272.  The m orning following his arrival, Si gnal hosted an orientation for the new \nworkers.  D uring that m eeting, Satya learned for  the first tim e that he would need to pay an \nadditional $170 for his tools.  Sa tya was also forced to sign se veral more form s in English.   \nWhen Satya asked Signalโs representatives to explain what the forms said, they refused. \n273.  As a result of the conditions at the Texa s Labor Camp, Satya felt isolated, lonely, \nand anxious.  At one point, he was hospitalized w ith an eye injury resulting from the conditions \nin which he was forced to weld.  Satya did not complain, however, because he was fearful Signal \nwould terminate his employment if he did.  His fear was based in part upon news that (1) Signal \nhad threatened to deport a work er who refused to do a particular  job; and (2) another worker \n- 51 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 52 of 76 PageID #:  52\nmissed two days of wor k and was forcibly depor ted by Signal.  Satya f elt further compelled to \nstay at Signal, because he could not repay the debts he incurred for the recruitment fees if he left \nand believed he would receive a green card if he stayed. \n274.  Defendants have never returned any of  the โrecruitment feesโ incurred by Satya \nand never received provided a green card for Satya or his family. \n275.  Satya relied upon Defendantsโ prom ises of perm anent residency, long-term \nemployment, and good working c onditions.  He would not have in curred subs tantial debt,  \nrelinquished prior em ployment, or agreed to wo rk for Si gnal in the absence of such false \npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal wou ld attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees,  Satya felt intim idated into acquiescence and compelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \nMoorthy Nadhamuni \n276.  In November 2006, while Moorthy Nadham uni (โMoorthyโ) was working as a \nfitter in Dubai, he learned of a  job opportunity in the United States through an advertisement in \nthe Indian newspaper, Dinathandy.  The advertisement was placed by Dewan Consultants, stated \nDewan was seeking to f ill permanent job vaca ncies, and p romised employment in the United \nStates along with permanent residency through a green card. \n277.  As a result of the advertisem ent, Moorthy took an e mergency leave from  his \nposition in Dubai and travelled to  Chennai, India to attend an infor mational meeting about the \nopportunity. \n278.  Pol, Dewan, his em ployee Salimon, and othe rs were present at the m eeting.  \nDuring the m eeting, Dewan told Moorthy that he  had to pass a test, which cost 500 rupees \n- 52 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 53 of 76 PageID #:  53\n(approximately $11), to be eligible for potential employment.  Moorthy paid the 500 rupees and \npassed the test. Salim on contacted Moorthy three days later and  instructed him to attend an \nupcoming meeting. \n279.  Approximately one week later, Moor thy attended a general m eeting led by \nDewan.  Several other workers were  present.  Dewan inform ed the workers that they had been \nselected to work f or Signal Interna tional in th e United States at either  a Texas or Mississipp i \nfacility, that workers w ould be paid $14-18/ho ur, and that the workers would receive green \ncards. \n280.  Dewan informed the workers  that they w ould first have to attend an interview  \nwith the United States Consulate in Chennai.  If the interview went well, the work ers would be \ngiven H-2B visa and would recei ve a green card approxim ately 18 months after working in the \nUnited States.  Dewan also promised the workers that, after they received their green cards, their \nfamilies could join them in the United States. \n281.  Dewan stated the green card processing  would cost the workers eight lakhs \n(approximately $18,000) in three installm ents.  First the workers had to pay Dewan 35,000 \nrupees (approximately $787).  Second, the workers would have to pay $3,871 to Pol and $3,871 \nto Burnett in cashierโs check by late January.   Finally, the workers would have to pay the \nremainder of the eigh t lakhs to  Dewan.  Dewan further stated  that the workersโ green cards \nwould be p rocessed and their f amilies could join them in the United  States, but only if  the \nworkers paid these fees. \n282.  Moorthy made the initial payment to Dewan with money he had saved from his \nprevious employment.  To accumulate the remainder of the eight lakhs, Moorthy borrowed funds \nfrom a local lender, pledging his wifeโs land as collateral, and pawned his wifeโs jewelry. \n- 53 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 54 of 76 PageID #:  54\n283.  After receiving Moorthyโs initial payment, Dewan inf ormed Moorthy that his \ninterview with the Con sulate was scheduled  for Decem ber 2, 2006.  Dewan also inform ed \nMoorthy that he must bring an additional 4,600 rupees (approximately $103) for visa processing. \n284.  On December 2, 2006, Moorthy arrived in Chennai.  He met with Dewan prior to \nhis interview, during which Dewan coached Moorthy regarding  the interview and provided him \nwith documents for the Consulate. \n285.  Moorthy was subsequently approved fo r a visa.  After the approval, Dewan \ninstructed Moorthy to make the final payment of $3,871 to both Pol and Burnett. \n286.  On approxim ately February 13, 2007, Moorthy m et Dewan in Chennai and \nreceived a ticket from Chenna i to Mum bai.  Dewan said that Moorthy would receive the \nremainder of his ticket to the United States in Mumbai. \n287.  On February 14, 2007, Moorthy travelled  from Chennai to Dewanโs office in \nMumbai.  There, he and several other worker s were called one by one to m ake their final \npayments to Pol, Burnett, and Dewan.  Som e workers were unable to m ake the payments and \nwere informed by Dewanโs representatives that  they would not receive plane tickets and would \nforfeit all prior payments if they did not make the final payment in full.  Having witnessed this, \nMoorthy felt com pelled to m ake his paym ents.  After m aking that paym ent, Moorthy was \nrequired to sign several forms in English, which Dewanโs representatives refused to translate. \n288.  On February 15, 2007, Moorthy departed Mu mbai for Houston, Texas.  When he \narrived in Houston, a Signal representative pi cked him up a t the airport and brought Moorthy \nalong with the other workers to the Texas Labor Camp. \n289.  Moorthy was appalled by the living c onditions, whichโas described aboveโ\nwere horrid.  They were m uch worse than the living conditions he had experienced previously \n- 54 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 55 of 76 PageID #:  55\nwhen working in Dubai and Singapore.  Signal  refused to serve vegetarian food, even though \nMoorthy is a vegetarian for religious reasons.  Meanwhile, Signal continued deducting fees from \nMoorthyโs paychecks for food and accommodations. \n290.  Moorthy felt trapped and believed that,  because of the debt he had incurred, he \nhad to continue working f or Signal despite the repreh ensible conditions.  In additio n, based on \nthe promises made to him previously, Moorthy also believed that he would receive a green card \nif he continued to work for Signa l and that his family could eventually join him in the United  \nStates.  Accordingly, Moorthy continued to work for Signal without complaint. \n291.  Defendants have never returned any of  the โrecru itment feesโ incurred by  \nMoorthy and never provided a green card for Moorthy or his family. \n292.  Moorthy relied upon Defendantsโ prom ises of perm anent residency, long-term \nemployment, and good working c onditions.  He would not have in curred subs tantial debt,  \nrelinquished prior em ployment, or agreed to wo rk for Si gnal in the absence of such false \npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal wou ld attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees,  Moorthy felt intim idated into acqu iescence and compelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \nRajendran Sappani \n293.  In 2006, R ajendran Sappani (โSappaniโ)  was working in Singapore when he  \nlearned about a newspaper advertisem ent pl aced by Dewan offering welders and fitters \nemployment and permanent residency in the United States. \n294.  Sappani learned that Dewan Consultants was holding interviews for the positions \nin Chennai, India, and that the last date to interview was November 11, 2006. \n- 55 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 56 of 76 PageID #:  56\n295.  On or around November 8, 2006, Sappani left his job in Singapore and returned to \nhis hometown of Trichy, India, be fore travelling to Chenna i for an interview and testing with \nDewan. \n296.  Sappani interviewed with Dewan and passed a written pipe  fitting test.  After the \ntest, Sappani he was required to pay eight la kh (approximately $18,000) for the employm ent \nopportunity, visa processing, and green card.  He was also required to make an initial payment of \n45,000 rupees to Dewan.  Dewan also informed Sappani he would need to pass an interview with \nthe Consulate and that,  if the  Consulate did not stam p his passport with a visa, Sappani would \nforfeit the 45,000 rupees payment. \n297.  To raise the funds necessary to pay  the recruitm ent fees, Sappani borrowed \nmoney from lenders.  T o obtain one of the loans, the lender required Sappani to prove that the \nfunds were for a green card.  Sappani contacted Dewan who faxed a letter to Sappani confirming \nthat Sappani would be receivi ng a green card.  Sappani presen ted the letter to the bank and  \nreceived the funds.  Sappani also sold his wi feโs jewelryโwith the exception of her wedding \nband, which he used as collateral for a loanโand  mortgaged his familyโs house and land.  As a \nresult, his family now pays 1,000 rupees per month to live in the house.   \n298.  Subsequently, Sappani attended an inte rview with the United Sta tes Consulate \nand was processed for a visa.  In December 2006, prior to leaving for the United States, Sappani \nwas instructed to trave l to Dewanโs of fice in Mumbai, where he paid the final recruiting fees, \nincluding an additional 1,500-rupee fee for a m edical certificate.  Dewan withheld Sappaniโs \npassport until the final paym ents were made.  Sappani was then required to sign several papers \nquickly, without an opportunity to read them, before he received his ticket to travel to the United \nStates. \n- 56 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 57 of 76 PageID #:  57\n299.  On or abou t December 18, 2006, Sappani ar rived at Sign alโs Orange, Texas \nfacility.  Sappani was shocked by the condition s at the Texas Labor Camp, which were m uch \nworse than he had experienced in Singapore.   But Sappani felt that he could not turn back \nbecause have no way of repaying the money he had borrowed.  As a result, Sappani was afraid to \ndo anything that might create problems for him at Signal. \n300.  Defendants have never returned any of the โrecruitment feesโ incurred by Sappani \nand never provided a green card for Sappani. \n301.  Sappani relied upon Defendantsโ prom ises of perm anent residency, long-term  \nemployment, and good working c onditions.  He would not have in curred subs tantial debt,  \nrelinquished prior em ployment, or agreed to wo rk for Si gnal in the absence of such false \npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal wou ld attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees,  Sappani felt intimidated into acquiescence and com pelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \nRajendran Subramani \n302.  Rajendran Subram ani  (โRajendranโ) is  a welder and structural fitter from \nTiruchirappali, India.  Rajendran supports his mother and family financially. \n303.  In or about 2006, Rajendran was working  as welder in Malaysia.  His friend \ninformed him about an advertisement in a Hindu newspaper offering the opportunity to live and \nwork in the United States as welder or fitter and obtain a green ca rd.  Rajendran reviewed the \nadvertisement and confirmed that it prom ised the opportunity to get a  green card in the United \nStates.  To take advantage of this opportunity,  Rajendran travelled to I ndia to interview for a  \nposition.    \n- 57 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 58 of 76 PageID #:  58\n304.  On or about January 7, 2007, Rajendran interviewed with Salim on, an employee \nof Dewan.  Rajendran understood that Dewan wa s recruiting workers on behalf of Signal.   \nDuring this interview, Salimon represented to Rajendran that he would make $18.00 per hour in \nthe United States, that there w ould be opportunities to receive  overtime pay, and the job with \nSignal would last for at least two years.  Salimon further represented Rajendran would initially \nreceive a visa every six  months, but that af ter two years Signal would get a green card for  \nRajendran and help him bring his family to the United Sates.   \n305.  Despite the fact that Rajendran had a two-year contract for his job in Malaysia, he \nwas very interested in obtaining a green card and earning an income that was higher than what he \nwas making in Malaysia.  Rajendran felt that this employment opportunity would permit him to \nmake a better life for his family and to support his aging mother. \n306.  During the interview, Rajendran spoke with Salimon about his work arrangement \nin Malaysia and described the  accommodations, food, and benefits  that were provided by the  \nemployer.  Salim on prom ised Rajendran that  Signal would provide sim ilar type of \naccommodations, food, and benefits, including that  he would only have to share an  apartment \nwith a few men. \n307.  Salimon told Rajendran that it would cost  him eight lahks for the opportunity to \nwork for Signal and receive a green card.  Base d on the representations that Salim on made on \nbehalf of Signal, including the representations a bout receiving a green card for him self and his \nfamily, Rajendran agreed to pay the money. \n308.  Rajendran had saved about 100,000 rupees  during his time working in Malaysia, \nbut still needed to borrow an additional 700,000 rup ees to pay the recruitment fee.  Rajendranโs \nmother used to work f or a wealth y family, the Muthus, who agreed to  loan Ra jendran the \n- 58 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 59 of 76 PageID #:  59\n700,000 rupees at an interest  rate of three percent (3%) per m onth, a total of thirty-six percent \n(36%) interest per year. \n309.  In or about January 2007, Rajendran paid  40,000 rupees ($900) to Salimon as an \ninitial deposit in orde r to obtain  an interview with the U.S. Consulate.  Approxim ately four \nweeks la ter, Salim on called  Rajen dran and  to ld him  that his interview was sc heduled f or \nFebruary 7, 2007.  Rajendran met with Salimon in Madras in order to coach him for interview. \n310.  Rajendran met with the em bassy on or  about February 7, 2007, and after the \nmeeting they told him that his passport would be sent to S alimon once it was stamped.  Several \ndays after the interview with  the embassy Rajendran received  a phone call from Dewan saying \nthat they had his passport, but that he needed to come to Dewanโs office in Bombay to pay the \nremaining 760,000 rupees, which he did prior to departing for the United States. \n311.  On February 15, 2007, Rajendran traveled  to the United States.  A  Signal \nemployee picked up Rajendran and other Indian  workers at the airport in Houston, Texas and \ndrove them to the Texas Labor Camp. \n312.  Rajendran thought that the Texas L abor Camp resembled a prisonโit was very \nisolated, it was surrounded by a fence, and guarded by security guards. \n313.  A Signal employee had Rajendran and other Indian workers complete paperwork \nwhen they arrived at the Texas Labor Cam p.  Signal did not, however, tr anslate or explain the \npaperwork for the Indian workers. \n314.  At the Texas Labor Cam p, Rajendran wa s required to shar e an overcrowded \nbunkhouse with more than twenty (20) men.   The bunk beds were so tightly packed together that \nRajendran and others were forced to sleep with their suitcases in their beds with them.  The toilet \nand showering facilities were insufficient and unsanitary.  Indeed, there was only bathroom and \n- 59 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 60 of 76 PageID #:  60\none shower between the twenty men.  There was no privacy at the bunkhouse and sleep was very \ndifficult due to the close quarters, oppressive  smells, and constant noise from  the workers \ncoming and going to their different shifts. \n315.  As described above, the food that Signal  provided was deplorable.  Rajendran \noften became ill from the food, which was freq uently rotten and/or left out for lon g periods of \ntime. \n316.  Signal deducted approximately $1,050 per month from Rajendranโs paychecks for \nroom and board.  Prior to arriving at the Texa s Labor Camp, Rajendran had not been infor med \nthis amount would be withheld from his paychecks.   \n317.  As a result of the conditions at the Texas Labor Ca mp, Rajendran asked Signal if \nhe could live somewhere else, but he was told  Signal would still deduct $1,050 per month from  \nhis paychecks if he m oved.  Because of the su bstantial debt Rajendran had incurred to pay th e \nrecruitment fees, he could not afford to pay  for accommodations outside the Texas Labor Camp \nand still pay Signal $1,050 per m onth.  Rajendran was, in effect, compelled to stay in the Texas \nLabor Camp. \n318.  Rajendran and other workers com plained to Signal about the awful conditions at \nthe Texas Labor Cam p.  In response, Signal th reatened to send Rajendran and other workers \nback to India if they continued to complain or spoke to others about Signalโs actions.  Faced with \nthreats of deportation, and crushing  debt in Indian, Rajendran fe lt compelled to continue his \nemployment at Signal.  \n319.  Notwithstanding the prior promises of employment for two years and a green card \nfor Rajendran and his family, during a meeting in June 2007, Signal informed Rajendran and the \nothers who voiced concern about the conditions at  the Texas Labor Camp that they could not \n- 60 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 61 of 76 PageID #:  61\nwork for Signal after July 30, 2007 and that Signal  would not renew their visas.  At that point, \nRajendran realized that the promises about the length of his employment and Signal obtaining a \ngreen card for Rajendran and his family were lies. \n320.  Defendants have never returned any of  the โrecru itment feesโ incurred by  \nRajendran and never provided a green card for Rajendran or his family. \n321.  Rajendran relied upon Defendantsโ prom ises of permanent residency, long-term \nemployment, and good working c onditions.  He would not have in curred subs tantial debt,  \nrelinquished prior em ployment, or agreed to wo rk for Si gnal in the absence of such false \npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal wou ld attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees,  Rajendran felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \nVenkata Satya Sivagi Rao Talabathulla \n322.  In or about May 2006, while working as a structural welder in Andhra Pradesh, \nIndia, Venkata Satya Sivagi Rao Talabathulla (โTalabathullaโ) saw an advertisement in the local \nnewspaper, Eenadu, for potential employment in the Unite d States.  The advertise ment stated \nthat an Americ an company was hiring welders  and pipefitters for its f acilities in the United  \nStates.  The advertisement gave certain dates fo r tests and interviews in Chennai, and provided \nthe contact information for Dewan. \n323.  Talabathulla and three of his friends  traveled to Chennai 16 hours by train to \ndiscuss the opportunity with Dewan.  Dewan expl ained the job opportunity, represented that it \nwas for long-term employment, that there was ample work, and that workers would be processed \nfor green cards.  Specifically, Dewan infor med Talabathulla that he would work under an H-2B \n- 61 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 62 of 76 PageID #:  62\nvisa for the initial nine m onths and then woul d be processed for and receive a green card.   \nDewan also explained that that Talabathulla w ould need to undergo a testing process that was \nbeing conducted over the next couple of days. \n324.  Dewan required that Talabathulla pay  two lakhs (approximately $4,500), within \n10 days to proceed.  Talabathulla needed to go back home to Andhra Pradesh in order to obtain \nthe money.  Before leav ing to obtain the m oney, Talabathulla took and passed the fitting test.   \nDuring the test, Talabathulla met Pol, who informed him that the job opportunity was for Signal.  \nPol reiterated the promise of permanent residency in the United States.  \n325.  Talabathulla paid two lakhs to Dewan in  November 2006.  In order to pay those \nfunds, Talabathulla had to borrow money from  his father, who in turn borrowed from lenders at \nan interest rate of 3% per month (43% per year). \n326.  After receiving Talabathullaโs paym ent, Dewan informed Talabathulla that h e \nneeded to pay an additional $5,373 to Malvern  Burnett, $5,373 to Michael Pol, and another \n$3,680 to Dewan.  Talabathulla ultim ately paid these am ounts.  To do so, Talaba thulla had to \nborrow more money from his father, who in turn borrowed the money from lenders, pledging his \nhouse as collateral for the loan. \n327.  In December 2006, Talabathulla traveled to Dewanโs office in Mumbai in order to \nreceive his passport and airline ticket to the United States.  Talabathulla arrived shortly before \nhis plane was scheduled to depart for the Unit ed States.  During this m eeting, Dewan required \nthat Talabathulla pay the rem aining recruitm ent f ees in  order  to re ceive his passport.   \nTalabathulla felt that he had  no choice but to follow Dewanโs  directions.  After receiving \nTalabathullaโs paym ent, Dewan gave Talabath ulla h is pa ssport a s well as an  Off er of \nEmployment letter from Signal that was in English and had not b een translated.  Dewan refused \n- 62 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 63 of 76 PageID #:  63\nto provide a receipt for the payment.   Before leaving for the United States, Dewan continued to  \nassure Talabathulla that he would receive a green card.  \n328.  When Talabathulla arrived in the United States, Signal informed him that it going \nto deduct approxim ately $1,050 pe r month from his  salary for room a nd board.  He was also \ninformed that he would be charged these am ounts regardless of whether he lived  at the Texas \nLabor Camp.   This was the first time Talabathulla had heard that he would be charged for room \nand board.  As described above, the conditio ns at the Texas Labor Ca mp were deplorable.   \nBecause Talabathulla could not afford to pay fo r living expenses twice and repay h is loans, he \nfelt compelled to remain at the Texas Labor Camp.  \n329.  While he was at the Texas Labor Ca mp, Defendants continued to assure \nTalabathulla that he would receive a green card.   \n330.  During the spring of 2007, Talabathulla he  that Signal had threatened to deport \nother Indian workers back to India.  Signal ultim ately transferred Talabathulla to its f acility in \nPascagoula, Mississippi and reduced his wages.  In doing so, however, Signal again reiterated its \npromise that there would be am ple work at the  Mississippi facility, which ultimately turned out \nnot to be true.  As a res ult of the threats of deportation and the debt he had incurred to pay the \nrecruitment fees, Talabathulla felt compelled to remain at Signal, work at its Mississippi facility, \nand accept the lower wages. \n331.  Defendants have never returned any of  the โrecru itment feesโ incurred by  \nTalabathulla and never provided a green card for Talabathulla. \n332.  Talabathulla relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency, long-term \nemployment, and good working c onditions.  He would not have in curred subs tantial debt,  \nrelinquished prior em ployment, or agreed to wo rk for Si gnal in the absence of such false \n- 63 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 64 of 76 PageID #:  64\npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal wou ld attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees, Talabathulla felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \nSammanasunathan Siluvaimuthu \n333.  In or around 2005, while working as a we lder in Abu Dhabi, Samm anasunathan \nSiluvaimuthu (โSiluvaimuthuโ) saw a newspaper advertisement placed by Dewan seeking fitters \nand welders.  The advertisement offered the opportunity to work in the United States and obtain \na green card.   \n334.  Siluvaimuthu spoke with Dewan and  was told to attend an upcom ing \ninformational meeting if he was interes ted in the job opportunity.   During the call, Dewan  \npromised Siluvaimuthu that he would receive a green card as part of the job opportunity.   \n335.  Siluvaimuthu subsequently attended the inform ational m eeting, along \napproximately 100 other Indian workers.  Pol  and Dewan were present at the m eeting and \nexplained the job opportunity.  Am ong other things , they represented that the job opportunity \nwas with Signal and that Signal would obtain permanent residency for the workers in the United \nStates. \n336.  Pol and De wan told Siluvaim uthu and the other workers that they had to pay \nrecruitment fees for the job opportunity totaling  the equivalent of six or seven lakhs.  They \nexplained that the workers could pay the recru itment fees in three installments, if they did not \nhave enough money up front. \n337.  Siluvaimuthu did not believe he had enough money to pay the recruitment fees. \n- 64 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 65 of 76 PageID #:  65\n338.  In or around Nove mber 2006, however, Sil uvaimuthu learned th at some of hi s \nfriends were going to work for Signal through  Dewan Consultants.  Siluvaimuthu had dreamed \nof living in the United States, a nd decided to pursue the job opport unity with Signal.  To that \nend, he met with Sachin Dewan in Chennai for te sting.  After passing the test, Dewan inform ed \nSiluvaimuthu that the recruitment fees had risen to 8.5 lakhs (approximately $19,125). \n339.  Siluvaimuthu was informed that he woul d have to pay 3.5 lakhs (approxim ately \n$7,875) up front.  Siluvaim uthu paid the initial  3.5 lakhs by dem and draft.  To do s o, \nSiluvaimuthu borrowed m oney from friends at an  interest rate of 5 percent per m onth.  \nSiluvaimuthu received a loan for  the remainder of the 8.5 lakhs.   As collateral for th e loan, \nSiluvaimuthu pledged his house and his wifeโs jewelry. \n340.  Subsequently, Siluvaimuthu met with Dewan to pay the remaining recruiting fees.  \nDuring that meeting, Dewan represented to Siluva imuthu that he would r eceive a green card in \napproximately 6 months and then could bring his family to join him in the United States.  Dewan \nfurther represented that the em ployment with  Signal would be long-term  and the living \nconditions would be comfortable, safe, and sanitary. \n341.  On or around November 24, 2006, Siluvaimuthu received a visa from the United \nStates Consulate in Chennai.  Following Siluvaimuthuโs interview at the Consulate, Dewan kept \nSiluvaimuthuโs passport. \n342.  Shortly before he was  to le ave for the United States, Siluvaim uthu attended a \nmeeting at Dewanโs office, durin g which he was forced to sign form s in English without a \ntranslation.  Siluvaimuthu felt compelled to sign the forms because his plane to the United States \nwas leaving shortly, he had paid the recruitment fees to Dewan, and Dewan still had his passport.  \n- 65 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 1    Filed 08/07/13   Page 66 of 76 PageID #:  66\nDewan only returned Siluvaimuthuโ s passport immediately before he  boarded the f light to the \nUnited States. \n343.  When Siluvaimuthu arrived at the Texas Labor Ca mp, he was horrified by the \nconditions.  Signal subsequently inform ed hi m, for the first tim e, that it would deduct \napproximately $1,050 per m onth from his wages for  room and board, regardless of whether he \nlived at the Texas Labor Camp.  Despite the conditions, Siluvaimuthu felt compelled to remain at \nthe Texas Labor Camp and continue working because he could not afford to pay twice for room \nand board and also repay the debt he had incurred in India. \n344.  Defendants have never returned any of  the โrecru itment feesโ incurred by  \nSiluvaimuthu and never provided a green card for Siluvaimuthu. \n345.  Siluvaimuthu relied upon Defendantsโ pr omises of perm anent residency, long-\nterm employment, and good working condition s.  He would not have incurred sub stantial debt, \nrelinquished prior em ployment, or agreed to wo rk for Si gnal in the absence of such false \npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal wou ld attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees, Siluvaimuthu felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled \nto continue working for Signal. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nTHE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION ACT OF 2003 \nForced Labor (18 U.S.C. ยง 1589) (Trafficking with Respect to Peonage, Slavery, Involuntary \nServitude, or Forced Labor) (18 U.S.C. ยง 1590) \nAll Defendants \n346.

This is a human trafficking case brought by Indian workers who were trafficked \ninto the United States through the governm entโs H-2B guest worker program .  Plaintiffs were \ntrafficked to the state of Texas in order to provide labor and services to Signal International, Inc., \nSignal International, LLC, Signal International Texas, G.P., and Signal International Texas, L.P. \n(collectively, โSignalโ).  In an effort to procure a cheap, compliant and expendable labor source, \nDefendants targeted Indian workers, recruiting Plaintiffs for positions as pipefitters and welders \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 2 of 82 PageID #:  828\nwith Signal using false promises of assistance in applying for and obtaining permanent residence \nin the United States.  Defendants then bilked Plai ntiffs out of tens of thousands of dollars in \nโrecruitment feesโ (for which Plai ntiffs assumed massive debt), trafficked them into the United  \nStates, forced them to live in squalid condition s in a gated,  guarded, isolated labor camp, and \nrequired them to pay exorbitant sums for the โpri vilegeโ of living in these repulsive conditions.   \nIf Plaintiffs complained, they were threatened with adverse immigration and employment action \nand the resulting prospect of financial ruin.  De fendants did not treat non-Indian workers in the \nsame manner. \n2.  Plaintiffs are all former employees of Signalโs Orange, Texas fa cility.  Plaintiffs \nbring this action to recover for the unlawful  and fraudulent conduct of Signal and its agents: \nMalvern C. Burnett; the  Law Off ices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C.; Gulf  Coast I mmigration \nLaw Center, LLC; Sachin Dewan; Dewan Consu ltant Pvt. Ltd.; Michael Pol; and Global \nResources, Inc. (the โAgentsโ).1 \n3.  Signal is a Gulf Coast-based marine and fabrication company.  Faced with a labor \nshortage and significant volum e of work in the wake of Hurrican e Katrina, S ignal sought to \nrecruit s everal hund red Indian wo rkers for p ositions as welders and  pipefitters in Signalโs  \nfacilities in Orange, Texas and Pascagoula, Mississippi. \n4.  Signal retained the Agents to as sist in the re cruitment process.  Sp ecifically, \nSignal retained Michael Pol and his com pany Global Resources, Inc. (collectively referred to as \n                                              \n1   On June 13, 2013, Michael Pol filed for Ch apter 7 bankruptcy in the United S tates \nBankruptcy Court for the Southe rn District of Mi ssissippi (Case No. 13 -51168-KMG).  Due to \nthe automatic bankruptcy stay, Michael Pol has not been included as a defendant in this action. \n- 2 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 3 of 82 PageID #:  829\nโPolโ unless a distinction is drawn), a labor r ecruitment firm based in Mississ ippi; attorney \nMalvern C. Burnett and  his law firm s, the Law  Offices of Malvern C. Burnett an d Gulf Coast \nImmigration Law Center, LLC (collectively ref erred to as โBurnettโ unl ess a distinction is \ndrawn); and Sachin Dewan and his company, Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd. (collectively referred \nto as โDewanโ unless a distin ction is drawn), a  labor recruitment firm in India.  Signal also \nexecuted a power of attorney authorizing Dewan Consultants to recruit for Signal abroad. \n5.  To minimize cost to Signal, Defendants  and Pol designed a schem e in which the \nworkers would pay for their own recruitm ent, immigration processing, and travel, which was \nmemorialized in the April 18,  2006 Skilled Worker Agreement between Signal and Global.   \nUnder this scheme, any expenses and fees not  paid up front by the workers would be paid by \nGlobal.  Global, in turn, would deduct amounts from the workersโ wages in order to recoup those \nexpenses and fees directly from the workers.  Signal, however, would pay nothing. \n6.  By at least m id-2006, the Agents and, upon inform ation and belief, \nrepresentatives of Signal began tr aveling to In dia to rec ruit workers, including Plaintiffs.  In \nnewspaper advertisements and in-person m eetings, Defendants and Pol prom ised to provide \nstable employment and assist Plaintiffs and other workers in  applying for and obtaining a green \ncard for perm anent residence in the United S tates.  In ex change, Plaintiffs and other workers  \nwere required to pay for โrecruitm ent feesโ to the Agentsโranging anywhere from $10,000 to \n$25,000.  Defendants and Pol further represented that Plaintiffsโ families would be able to jo in \nthem in the United States.   \n7.  To alleviate any concerns about the pot ential living conditions in the United \nStates, Defendants and Pol repres ented during in-person m eetings that the liv ing conditions \nwould be comparable to those some of the Plai ntiffs described experiencing in Singapore and \n- 3 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 4 of 82 PageID #:  830\nDubaiโwhich included, for example, a shar ed two-bedroom  a partment, quality food, \ntransportation to and from the job site, and one trip back to India per year. \n8.  Because Signalโs need  for workers was  immediate, Defendants and Pol told  \nPlaintiffs they would first ac quire temporary work visas (H-2 B) because the visas could be \nobtained faster than green cards, but that De fendants would also apply for green cards on \nPlaintiffsโ behalf. \n9.  Lured by D efendantsโ fraudulent promises of legal and perm anent work-based \nimmigration to the United States for themselves and their families, Plaintiffs paid the exorbitant \nrecruiting fees to take advantage of the seem ingly promising opportunities, causing them selves \nand their families to incur massive debt.  Inde ed, to cover the recruiting and immigration fees \nPlaintiffs often had to sell fam ily assets, take  out loans secured by real property and jewelry, \nborrow m oney with high interest rates, and ot herwise incur lif e-altering debt.   Plain tiffs \nundertook such debt and paid th e recruiting and imm igration fees in reasonable reliance on \nDefendantsโ promises.  In further reliance on Defendantsโ promises, some Plaintiffs relinquished \nstable employment opportunities in Singapore and elsewhere. \n10.  Defendants, however, had no intention of making good on their promises to assist \nPlaintiffs in applying for and  obtaining permanent residency.   To be sure, Defendants did not \ntakeโindeed, had no intention of  takingโsteps to assist Plainti ffs in applying for or obtaining \npermanent residency.  In fact, at the suggestion  of its Agents, Signal repr esented to the United \nStates governm ent that it was employing the  Indian workers (incl uding Plaintiffs) only \ntemporarily and that they would be  returned to India โwithin the . . . year.โ  Moreover, internal \ncorrespondence among Signal management from May 2006 reflects that โ[a] ll [Signal is] doing \nnow is bringing the workers in under the H2B pr ogram.โ  Defendants brought  Plaintiffs to the \n- 4 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 5 of 82 PageID #:  831\nUnited States through the tem porary H-2B guestworker visa  program despite knowing, and \nfailing to disclose, that the guestworker program was fundamentally incompatible with filing for \ngreen cards. \n11.  Defendants never inform ed Plaintiffs th at they had no intention of assisting \nPlaintiffs in applying for or obtaining green cards.  Nor did Defendants ever disclose to Plaintiffs \nthe representations they made to the United States government regarding the temporary nature of \ntheir employment and residence.   Plaintiffs were sim ply unaware that Defendantsโ prom ises \nregarding employment and permanent residency were false and re lied on the f alse promises to \ntheir detriment. \n12.  Upon arrival in the United States, Signal requ ired Plaintiffs to live in an isolated, \nIndian-only labor camp located outside of Orange , Texas (the โTexas Labor Cam pโ).  Contrary \nto Defendantsโ representations  regarding living conditions, the  conditions at the T exas Labor \nCamp were horrid.  Plaintiffs were forced to live in cramped trailersโcontaining up to 24 menโ\nwith little to no priva cy.  The tr ailers were so crowded som e Plaintiffs had to sleep on their \nluggage.  T he trailers had insufficient bathroom f acilities (one or two toile ts) that were rarely \ncleaned, which created not only an awful smell but also unsanitary living conditions.  Food was \navailable only at certain hours and was often rotten.  As a res ult of the conditions, several of the \nresidents became sick.  The cam p was also fenced, gated, and guarded, such  that Plaintiffs felt \nthey were being imprisoned.   \n13.  As with the โrecru itment fees,โ th e cost to live at the T exas Labor Cam p was \nborne by Plaintiffs.  Indeed, Signal charged P laintiffs mightily for the โrightโ to endure the \nhorrible conditions at the cam pโdeducting $35 per day seven days a week ($1,050 per m onth) \nout of the Plaintiffsโ pre-tax earnings.  If work ers asked to live of f-site, Signal informed them \n- 5 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 6 of 82 PageID #:  832\nthat it would still  deduct $1,050 per m onth from their income, effectively prohibiting workers \nfrom seeking more humane and sanitary conditions. \n14.  Significantly, non-Indian workers were not placed in guarded labor camps, were \nnot subjected to squalid living conditions, and di d not have exorbitant room  and board fees \ndeducted from their pre-tax earnings. \n15.  The Indian workers at the Texas Labor  Camp, including Plaintiffs, were also \nsubjected to different, less favorable em ployment conditions than non-Indians.  Upon \ninformation and belief, Indian workers were assigned projects that were more difficult and m ore \ndangerous than those assigned to  non-Indian   workers, received te rms and conditions  of \nemployment that were different from  and less  favorable than non-Indian em ployees, and were \nsubjected to offensive anti-Indian diatribe and repeated threats of deportation. \n16.  To prevent the Indian workers from   complaining, Defendants deceived them \nregarding their immig ration st atus, threatened them with  loss of immigration status and \ndeportation, and generally perpetrated a campaign of psychological coercion and fraud designed \nto render Indian workers com pliant, intimidated, and unable to leave Signalโs em ploy.  As an \nadditional element of control, Signal required Plaintiffs and other Indian workers to set up direct \ndeposit bank accounts to which Signal maintained access.  These accounts effectively permitted \nSignal to co ntrol workersโ ability to leave th e facility by threatening to cut off access to the  \naccounts.  Upon information and belief, Signal did exactly that to an Indian worker who had fled \nthe Pascagoula, Mississippi facility.   \n17.  Faced with crushing debt and fearful of  the possibility of deportation by Signal \nshould they com plain, Plaintiffs fe lt com pelled to continue working for Signal despite the \n- 6 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 7 of 82 PageID #:  833\ndreadful conditions at the Texas L abor Camp, the extortionate room  and board f ees, and the \ndiscriminatory employment conditions.  Simply put, Plaintiffs felt that they had no other option. \n18.  The compulsion Plaintiffs felt to continue working at Signal only increased when \nthey learned about the events that  transpired at the Pascagoula,  Mississippi facility on March 9, \n2007.  Upset that workers were com plaining about conditions at the facility, Signal decided to \nterminate and forcibly send five of t he more vocal Indian workers back to India.  Signal locked  \nthe gate at the Pascagoula facility, preventing workers from leaving, rounded up and detained the \nvocal workers, and informed them that they were being deported.  One of these workers was so \ndistraught over the threat of returning to I ndia without paying the debt he incurred over the \nrecruitment f ees that he attem pted to comm it suicide.  W hen news of the events and the  \nattempted suicide traveled to th e Texas Labo r Camp, Plaintiffs becam e even more afra id to \ncomplain about the con ditions they had been subj ect to.  Understandably, Plaintiffs feared that  \nthey would be returned to India and/or physically harmed if they did so. \n19.  Ultimately, less th an a year- and-a-half after coming to the Texas Lab or Camp, \nPlaintiffs were either term inated or told they  were being sent to work at the Pascagoula, \nMississippi facility for lower wages.  Faced with the latter prospect, some Plaintiffs escaped and \nfled the Texas Labor Camp. \n20.  At no point did Defendants apply for or  assist Plaintiffs in obtaining perm anent \nresidency for them selves or their fa milies.   At no point did Defendant s refund the tens of \nthousands of dollars in recrui tment and imm igration fees Plai ntiffs paid in reliance on \nDefendantsโ false promises.  And at no point did Defendants compensate or offer to compensate \nPlaintiffs for the conditions they were forced to  endure at the Texas Labor Cam p.  Indeed, at no \npoint did they even offer an apology.  Instead , Defendants m aintain that how they treated \n- 7 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 8 of 82 PageID #:  834\nPlaintiffs and the other Indian workers was both lawful and moral.  This mistaken viewpoint was \nmost recently espoused by Signalโs CEO in a pre ss release, brazenly  declaring that Signal \nโtreated [the Indian wo rkers] with dignity a nd respect jus t as we treat each and ev ery Signal \nemployee.โ \n21.  Signalโs self-delusion aside,  Plaintiffs were victim s  of reprehensible conduct.   \nPlaintiffs assert claims arising from violations of their rights  under the Victim s of Trafficking \nand Violence Protection Act (โTVPAโ), the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. ยง 1981), the Ku \nKlux Klan Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. ยง 1985), and claims for damages arising from fraud, negligent \nmisrepresentation, and breach of contract. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n22.

At all relevant tim es, the Defendants were  engaged in a joint venture with each \nother to recruit Plaintiffs, along with other Indi an workers, to work for Signal at the Orange, \nTexas facility. The Defendants entered into various written and oral agreements evidencing their \nagreement to accomplish such recruitment and each Defendant acted within the course and scope \n- 13 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 14 of 82 PageID #:  840\nof the venture and those agreements.  Defendants each had full knowled ge of the actions of the \nother Defendants set forth in this Complaint and consented, permitted, authorized and ratified, \neither expressly or impliedly the actions of the other Defendants. \nSPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS \nSignal Arranged for Dewan, Burnett, and Pol to Bring Temporary Workers  \nto the United States \n57.  The destruction caused by Hurrican e Katrina presented Signal with the potential \nto take on lucrative new work fixing damaged oil rigs, ships, and other machine platforms.  As a \nresult of the hurricane, however, som e of Signalโs workforce had left the Gulf Coast area, and \nSignal was in need of additional laborersโparticularly skilled fitters and welders. \n58.  In early 2006, Pol approached Signal about providing additional workers for their \noperations.  He inf ormed them that he could p rovide skilled fitters and welders f rom India to \nwork for Signal at no cost to Signal.  \n59.  Pol explained to Signal that he would work with Burnett and Dewan to recruit the \nworkers and obtain the appropriate  immigration status for such workers , but that th e workers, \nincluding Plaintiffs, would pay fo r all costs  and fees asso ciated with the rec ruitment process, \nimmigration processing, and travel to the Un ited S tates.  Signal w ould pay the workers, \nincluding Plaintiffs, between $14 - $18/hour, depending on each workerโs skill level. \n60.  Signal and  Global ex ecuted a S killed W orker Recruitm ent Agreem ent (the \nโRecruitment Agreementโ) on or about April 18, 2006, which set forth certain terms for Michael \nPol and Global to recruit foreign skilled worker s for employment at Signal โunder the โH-2Bโ \ntemporary program and/or the โperm anent residenceโ process.โ  The Recruitm ent Agreement \nrequired Global to be responsible  for delivering the workers โat  no cost to Si gnalโ, including \npaying for all costs associated w ith recruitment, transportation, and entry into the United States \n- 14 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 15 of 82 PageID #:  841\nby the foreign workers.   The co sts incurred by Po l and Global were to be paid by the foreign \nworkers, including Plaintiffs. \n61.  Dewan and Signal entered into a power of  attorney on or about June 19, 2006, \nwhich permitted Dewan to act as Signalโs โrepresentative in India to facilitate the recruitment of \nskilled workers to the U nited States of Americaโ  for employment with Signal.  This power of \nattorney authorized Dewan to advertise, conduct seminars, conduct skills tests and sign necessary \nlegal documentation related to the recruitment of skilled workers to work in the United States for \nSignal.  \n62.  In approxim ately m id- to late-2006, Si gnal entered into an attorney-client \nrelationship with Burnett with respect to legal issues related to Signalโs need for foreign workers.  \nUpon information and belief, Signal and Burnett en tered into a written retainer agreem ent.  \nUnder the retainer agreement, however, Signal would not be responsible for any legal fees owed \nto Burnett, but instead Burnett would receive compensation out of the โrecruitment feesโ paid by \nthe foreign workers, including Plaintiffs. \nThe Agents Recruited Plaintiffs and Other Indian Workers for Signal \n63.  Upon information and belief, Defendants targeted Plaintiffs for recruitment based \non their race and/or national origin.  Specifical ly, Defendants targeted Indian workers on the \nbelief that the Indian worker s would provide a source of ch eap, compliant and potentially \nexpendable labor.  The goal of this schem e was to m aximize benefits to the D efendantsโ\nincluding the fees received by the Agentsโat the expense of the Indian workers.   \n64.  Acting as Signalโs recruiting agents for the purposes of facilitating the recruitment \nof Indian workers for em ployment at Signal, Pol and Dewan pl aced advertisem ents in \nnewspapers throughout India and the United Arab  Emirates in the spring, summ er, and fall of \n2006 offering opportunities for welders and fitters to immigrate permanently to the United States \n- 15 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 16 of 82 PageID #:  842\nunder the auspices of Signal, a purported leading marine and fabrication company in Mississippi \nand Texas.  Defendants targeted only Indian work ers in their recruitment effortsโindeed, even \nthe adv ertisements used in the United Ara b  Emirates were p laced in Indian-langu age \nnewspapers. \n65.  Among other things, the advertisem ents and recru iting efforts prom ised \nโpermanent lifetime settlement in USA f or self and f amilies,โ โpermanent residencyโ in the \nUnited States, and/or โgreen cards.โ  Upon in formation and belief,  Pol and Dewan undertook \nthese advertisements and other recruiting efforts  on behalf of, at the direction of, and/or in \ncoordination with Signal and Burnett.  \n66.  Signal authorized Pol, Dewan, and Burnett to act as their agents for the p urposes \nof recruiting and providing Indian welders and fitters to fill anticipated H-2B guest worker jobs \nat Signalโs Orange, Texas operations. \n67.  Upon information and belief, Signal furt her authorized Pol, Dewan, and Burnett \nto represent that Signal would agree to sponsor  bona fide green card applications for the \nPlaintiffs and obtain at least two  H-2B visa extensions on behalf of  Plaintiffs to allow them  to \nremain in the United States workin g for Signal while their  green card applic ations were being \nprocessed. \n68.  Upon information and belief, Signal authorized these representations even though \nit knew or had reason to know that such visa extensions and green card applications would not be \nbona fide, valid, or lawful unde r United States immigration law  and even though Signal did not \nhave the intention at that time to apply for visa extensions and/or green cards on behalf of all the \nIndian workers, including the Plaintiffs. \n- 16 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 17 of 82 PageID #:  843\n69.  At the latest, Signal learned from  the firs t Indian workers to arrive at Signalโs  \nfacilities in Texas and Mississipp iโworkers who  arrived well in advance of Plaintiffsโthat \nthose workers had paid exorbitant recruitment fees to the Agents, and had m ade those payments \non the basis of prom ises of assistance in a pplying for and obtaining green cards which Signal \nknew was false.  Signal nonetheless  continued to facilitate the transportation of hundreds more \nIndian workers to Signal worksites in Texas and Mississippi, including Plaintiffs, because it was \nin Signalโs financial interest to do so. \nPlaintiffs Incurred Substantial Debt to Pay the Agentsโ โRecruitment Feesโ \n70.  In response to the advertisem ents  posted by Pol and Dewan, Plaintiffs \ncommunicated with Pol and Dewan in the spri ng, summer, and fall of 2006 via telephone, and \nattended in-person meetings with Pol, Dewan, and Burnett.  During those meetings, the Agents \ninformed Plaintiffs that the job opportunities that  had been advertised were with Signal.  In \naddition, the Agents, acting on Signalโs behalf, informed Plaintiffs of the opportunity to work for \nSignal on H-2B visas which would lead to permanent resident (green card) status. \n71.  Specifically, the Agents promised recruits, including Plaintiffs, that Signal would \nsponsor Plaintiffsโ green card applications and extend their H-2B  visas multiple times to enable \nPlaintiffs to work in the United States while  their green card applications were pending.  In \nexchange, each Plaintiff would have to pay fees totaling as much as 8 lakh rupees (approximately \n$18,000) in a series of approximately three installments. \n72.  At the time Plaintiffs made their paym ents, one rupee was worth approxim ately \n$0.0225, and one lakh (100,000 rupees) was worth approximately $2,250. \n73.  The Agents further informed recruits, including Plaintiffs, that they would be able \nto obtain legal permanent residence for their spouses and children. \n- 17 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 18 of 82 PageID #:  844\n74.  In addition, during the telephone comm unications, at recruitm ent meetings, and \nthrough written documents, the Agents (includi ng through their employees) represented to \nPlaintiffs that Defendant Si gnal would provide lawful, st able, and am ple em ployment \nopportunities, that working under an H-2B visa for Signal was not inconsistent with applying for \npermanent immigration status sponsored by Signal , and that Signal would  obtain for Plaintiffs \nwork-authorized green cards enabling the Plainti ffs to perm anently and legally reside in the \nUnited States with their families. \n75.  In such co mmunications with Pla intiffs, the Agents f urther prom ised to ac t \ndiligently and do everything necessary to ensure that Plaintiffs obtain green cards within 18-24 \nmonths of initiating the green card process. \n76.  Upon information and belief, employees of Signal attended some of the meetings \nand testing sessions with potential workers in India.  Further, upon information and belief, prior \nto the meetings and testing sessions Signal and th e Agents conferred regarding the logistics and \nsubstantive content of the meetings and testing sessions. \n77.  In reasonab le reliance on the Agentโs prom ises regard ing green cards and \nemployment opportunities in the U nited States, Plaintiffs undertook cons iderable personal and \nfamilial sa crifices, including the mortgaging   and/or s ale of  personal prope rty and othe r \nincurrence of debt, in order to am ass the funds necessary to initiate the green card process with \nDefendant Signal.  F or exam ple, Plaint iff Satheesh K annan Marimuthu, Balam urugan \nMarimuthu, and Rajendran Sappani sold their wive sโ jewelry and/or mortgaged their fam iliesโ \nhomes to cover the recruitm ent fees.  In a ddition, several Plaintiffs relinquished stable \nemployment in reliance on the Agentโs representations. \n- 18 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 19 of 82 PageID #:  845\n78.  Reasonably relying on these and other prom ises made to them  regarding green \ncards and work opportunities in the United States, Plaintiffs signed green card contracts with the \nAgents at v arious points from  mid-2006 to earl y 2007 and  paid the ex orbitant recruiting fees \nrequired by the contracts. \n79.  These contracts and other docum ents provided by the Agents prom ised that (1) \nPlaintiffs would work under a โp ermanent resident (green card)  program,โ and (2) Plaintiffs  \nwould promptly receive a refund of all or nearly  all of their paym ents if Defendants did not \nsucceed in securing green cards for Plaintiffs. \n80.  The Agents knew or should have known,  however, that they would not refund \nPlaintiffsโ money as promised in the contracts and other documents. \n81.  The Agents induced Plaintiffs to enter into the green card contracts without intent \nto diligently pursue Plaintiffsโ applications a nd without any basis whatso ever for representing \nthat Signal had lawful long-te rm employment opportunities to pr ovide Plaintiffs; that Signal \ncould legally apply for num erous H-2B visa extensions to m aintain Plaintiffsโ presence in th e \nUnited States; that working under an H-2B visa for Signal was not inconsistent with applying for \npermanent immigration status sponsored by Signal; that green card applications sponsored by the \nSignal would be valid and bona fide under U.S. immigration law; and that such applications were \nlikely to be successfully completed and approved within the promised timelines. \n82.  Plaintiffs would not have signed the green card contracts or paid the extraordinary \nrecruitment fees charg ed by the Agents had  they  kno wn that Defendantsโ p romises an d \nrepresentations were false and  that Defendants had faile d to disclose material facts concerning \nthe nature and terms and conditions of the immigration and work opportunities offered. \nDefendants Arranged for H-2B Visas \n- 19 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 20 of 82 PageID #:  846\n83.  On or about July 20, 2006, and August 17, 2006, the United States Department of \nLabor approved Signalโs labor certification applications for 590 H-2B workers for the period of \nOctober 1, 2006 through July 31, 2007. \n84.  In approving these applications, the United  States Department of Labor relied on \nthe accuracy of the applicationsโ stated 10-month period of need. \n85.  Upon inform ation and belief, the Departm ent of Laborโs internal guidelines \nprohibit it from  granting labor certification ap plications without relying on the applicationsโ \nstatement of need. \n86.  In late August and early Septem ber  2006, the United S tates Citizenship and \nImmigration Service (โUSCISโ) approved Signalโs H-2B visa petitions for 590 H-2B workers for \nthe period of October 1, 2006 through July 31, 2007. \n87.  In approv ing these v isa petition s, the  USCIS relied on  the accuracy of the \npetitionsโ stated 10-m onth period  of labor need and the represen tation that Signa lโs need was \nbased on a one-time, peak-load, temporary demand.  Indeed, according to regulation, the USCIS \nmust rely o n the stated  period  of the petitionerโs labor need.   See 8 C.F.R. 214.2(h)(6)(ii)(B) \n(2006). \n88.  Defendants knew that the stated period of  need in Signalโs applications f or labor \ncertifications and for H-2B visas were incons istent with Signalโs prom ises of perm anent \nresidency to Plaintiffs and its actual projecte d labor need and, therefore, Defendants knew these \nstatements to the government were false. \n89.  The Agents used the H-2B visas, obtained from the federal governm ent on the  \nbasis of false statements by Signal and Burnett, to elicit payments from Plaintiffs. \nDefendants Prepared to Bring Plaintiffs and Other Indian Workers \nto the United States \n- 20 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 21 of 82 PageID #:  847\n90.  At various times during the spring, su mmer, and fall of 2006, Signal employees  \nand certain of the Agents traveled  to various locations in India and the United Arab Emirates to \ntest Plaintiffsโ welding and pipefitting skills in anticipation of employing Plaintiffs in the United \nStates. \n91.  Plaintiffs paid to travel to the cities where these tests were held. \n92.  Plaintiffs also paid admission fees in order to take these tests. \n93.  Plaintiffs attended and passe d these tests, which were  overseen and graded by \nSignal and/or Dewanโs agents, employees, and/or representatives. \n94.  Upon information and belief, prior to atte nding these testing sessions the Agents \nand Signal conferred regarding the logistics and substantive content of the testing sessions. \n95.  After USCIS visa approval, Plaintiffs made necessary preparations to travel to the \nUnited States on H-2B visas to work for Signal,  including: paying to obtain necessary travel and \nlegal documents; making payments to the United States Consulate and the Agents for mandatory \nH-2B visa and consular processing fees; attending H-2B visa interviews; and, paying the Agents \nfor travel arrangements. \n96.  In order to secure H-2B visas to work  for Signal, Plaintiffs attended interviews \nwith United States consular offices in Indian cities. \n97.  To attend these consular interviews, Plainti ffs had to pay the costs of travel from \ntheir homes and/or current places of employment to various large Indian cities including Chennai \n(Madras) and Mumbai (Bombay). \n98.  The Agents required that Plaintiffs meet with Global, Pol, and/or Burnett in these \ncities before attending their consular interviews. \n- 21 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 22 of 82 PageID #:  848\n99.  Upon information and belief, prior to these meetings, the Agents conferred among \nthemselves and with Signal reg arding the topics to be discussed and instru ctions to be given to \nPlaintiffs at these meetings. \n100.  At the pre-interview meetings, the Agents ensured that Plaintiffs were up-to-date \non paying the recruitment fee installments required by their green card contracts. \n101.  Defendants further required that Plaint iffs pay an additional fee of 35,000 to \n45,000 rupees ($787 to $1,012) for H-2B visa processing. \n102.  The Agents required Plaintif fs to sign docum ents permitting Dewan to receive  \ntheir visa-stamped passports from the consular offices on Plaintiffsโ behalf. \n103.  The Agents also coached Plaintiffs on what to say during consular interviews.   \n104.  The Agents told P laintiffs that if  they did no t follow these instructions at the ir \ninterviews, Plaintiffs would not  receive their visas and would forfeit all of the m oney they had \nalready paid to Defendants, in addition to losing the opportunity to permanently immigrate to the \nUnited States. \n105.  During Plaintiffsโ consular interviews, th e consular official s took Plaintiffsโ  \npassports from them. \n106.  Once Plaintiffsโ visas w ere approved, consular officials sent the passports, with \nH-2B visas affixed, directly to Dewan. \n107.  After Plaintiffsโ visas w ere approved, the  Agents made travel arrang ements for \nPlaintiffsโ departures to the United States. \n108.  Before Plaintiffs could  leav e for the Un ited States,  however, Plain tiffs were \nrequired to attend final m eetings in Dewanโs office.  Such  meetings typically took place m ere \n- 22 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 23 of 82 PageID #:  849\nhours before Plaintiffsโ scheduled departures to the United States, when Dewanโs office was full \nof other Indian workers anxiously awaiting their departure to the United States.  \n109.  At these meetings, Pol and Dewan collected final installment payments required \nby Plaintiffsโ green card contracts. \n110.  Pol and Dewan also required Plaintiffsโm ost of whom do not  or did not at the \ntime proficiently read or speak Englishโto sign  English-language documents with little or no \ntime for review.  They did not allow Plaintiffs  to keep a copy of the documents.  Pol and Dewan \nor their staff de manded that Plaintiffs quickly sign the m andatory documents to avoid m issing \nthe flights to the United States and forfeiting the fees Plaintiffs had paid. \n111.  Plaintiffs had no reasonable opportunity  to review, negotiate, or m ake any \nchanges to the documents presented to them.  Even when Plaintiffs asked Defendants what the \ndocuments said, Defendants refused to interpret or tell Plaintiffs what the documents said. \n112.  Dewan also refused to provide receipts to Plaintiffs who requested evidence of the \namounts paid prior to Plaintiffsโ travel to the United States. \n113.  Pol and Dewan refused to return Plai ntiffsโ passportsโwhich had been in \nDefendant Dewanโs possession since after Plain tiffsโ H-2B vi sas were approved by consular \nofficialsโuntil Plaintiffs had paid the final installments and signed the mandatory paperwork. \n114.  Without possession of their passports,  and within this anxious and rushed \natmosphere, Plaintiffs had no reasonable opport unity to review, negotiate, and/or m ake any \nchanges to the documents presented to them. \n115.  On occasions when workers failed to presen t sufficient funds to pay  the final \ninstallment required by the green card contracts, Dewan and his associates threatened to destroy \nand/or deface the workersโ passports.  Such threat s were made in the presence of other workers, \n- 23 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 24 of 82 PageID #:  850\ncausing the other work ers to reas onably believe that they h ad no choice but to pay the final \ninstallments in full. \n116.  Because of the Dewan and Polโs coerciv e behavior during these p re-departure \nmeetings, and Plaintiffsโ extraordinary and incr easing levels of debt,  Plaintiffs reasonably \nbelieved that they had no choice but to m ake the payments required by the Agents and to travel \nto the United States to work for Signal. \n117.  Plaintiffs did not rece ive their pas sports from the Agents  until Plain tiffs had \nfulfilled all of Defendantsโ requirements. \n118.  At various times from late October 2006 to April 2007, Plaintiffs and other Indian \nworkers traveled from Mumbai to the United States on tickets arranged by Pol and Dewan. \n119.  Signal collected Plaintiffs at the Houston airport upon their arrival and transported \nthem immediately to the Texas Labor Camp. \n120.  Signal sent approximately 300 workers to its Pascagoula, Mississippi facility (the \nโMississippi Labor Campโ), and approximately 290 workers were sent to the Texas Labor Camp \nupon arrival in the United States. \n121.  Plaintiffs had no choice but to use th e Agents to secure em ployment wit h \nDefendant Signal.  Managem ent personnel at Si gnal prohibited Indian workers from  securing \nemployment at Signalโs operations  either through another recru iter or by bypassing  recruiters \naltogether and applying directly with Signal. \nMalvern Burnett Purported to Act As Plaintiffsโ Attorney \n122.  At all relevant times, Burnett had an attorney -client relationship with the Indian  \nworkers, including Plaintiffs, for purposes of immigration issues and Plaintiffsโ work for Signal. \n123.  Upon inform ation and belief, the Indian  workers, including  each Plaintiff, \nindividually entered into an Atto rney Services Agreement with Burn ett.  Those  agreements \n- 24 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 25 of 82 PageID #:  851\nprovided the following: (a) Burnett would โrepresent [Pl aintiff] as a li censed attorney in the \nUnited States of Am erica and file all necessa ry docum ents with the governm ent to assist \n[Plaintiff] make application for the permanent resident (green card) program;โ (b) Plaintiff would \npay Burnett $3750 for legal services; (c) Burnett  would โdo everything within [his] power to \nassist worker to obtain permanent residence status in the United States within 24 months;โ (d) if \nBurnett failed to obtain permanent residence status, Burnett would refund recruitments fees to his \nclients subject to certain exceptions; and (e) either party could โterminate the agreement with 30 \ndays notice given to the other party.โ  Finally,  the agreements provided that they โshall be \nconstrued, governed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Maharashtra, India \nand where applicable in the State of Mississippi.โ \n124.  As part of his services, Burnett prep ared the imm igration forms required for \nPlaintiffs to apply for H-2B status and, thus, to work for Signal in Texas.  In those forms, Burnett \nrepresented to the U.S. Departm ent of Homela nd Security, under penalty of perjury, that the \nPlaintiffs would stay in the United States only temporarily, returning to India within the year.  At \nthe same time Burnett was subm itting those forms, he was telling the Indian workers that they \nwould be eligible for perm anent residency, and that he would assist them in applying for green \ncards.  Further, Burnett was aware of the repr esentations Pol and Dewan had m ade to Indian \nworkers, including Plaintiffs, about receiv ing green cards in connectio n with em ployment at \nSignal.  Burnett also applied for H-2B visas for  Plaintiffs despite the fact that H-2 B visas are \nincompatible with permanent residency under fede ral law.  Burnett m isled Indian workers by \nconflating the H-2B visa and permanent resident status immigration processes in presentations to \nIndian workers during the recruitment process. \n- 25 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 26 of 82 PageID #:  852\n125.  In addition, Burnett filed with the Texas Workforce Commission completed ETA \n750 forms and attachments seeking perm ission to import and hire 590 foreign guest workers \n(including Plaintiffs) under 8 U.S. C. ยง  1101(a)15(H)(ii)(b).  In the applications to Texas, \nBurnett, on behalf of Signal, stated that Si gnal would em ploy workers from  October 1, 2006 \nthrough July 31, 2007.  Burnett knew that m aterial representationsโincluding those about the \nlength of  tim e the workers in tended to stay  in the United Statesโ were false.   Burnettโs  \nstatements in the application s contradicted De fendantsโ representations that he w ould assist \nPlaintiffs in obtaining permanent legal residence in the United States. \n126.  Despite acting as Plaintiffsโ attorn ey, Burnett concealed his tr ue loyalties from \nPlaintiffs by failing to disclose that he had a ttorney-client and business relationships with Signal \nand other Defendants, and was actively working to  promote Defendantsโ interest over those of \nPlaintiffs. \n127.  Specifically, by mid-2006, Burnett had entered into an attorney-client relationship \nwith Signal for the broad purpose of applying for  and obtaining lawful status for Indian workers \nto come to the United S tates.  In 2007, Signal  and Burnett entered into a Retainer Agreem ent \nmemorializing the arrangem entโnamely, that Bu rnett would rep resent Signal at ze ro co st \nbecause the fees for his work were to be paid by the Indian workers, including Plaintiffs.  Burnett \nfailed to disclose his attorney-client relationship or the payment arrangement with Signal to th e \nIndian workers, including Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs did not waive any conflic t of interest caused by \nBurnettโs relationship with Signal. \n128.  Similarly, Burnett f ailed to disclos e to Pl aintiffs his atto rney-client relationship \nwith Dewan and Pol, which began no later than mid-2006.  Plaintiffs did not waive any conflicts \nof interest relating to this relationship. \n- 26 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 27 of 82 PageID #:  853\n129.  Burnett also failed to disclose that he  had a โ Multilateral Business Agreementโ \nwith Dewan and Pol for  the broad purpose of r ecruiting Indian workers to com e to the United \nStates.  Plaintiffs did not waive any conflicts of interest relating to this relationship. \n130.  At all re levant times, Burnett pref erred Defendants to his I ndian clients even \nthough he owed them the same duty of loyalty.   \n131.  For exam ple, in a clear violation  of  his pr ofessional obligations, Burnett \nforwarded e-m ails he received fro m his Indian  clients to  third parties without the clientsโ \npermission. \n132.  Further, even though the  attorney-client relations hip between B urnett and \nPlaintiffs continued after Plainti ffs arrived in T exas, Plaintiffs were not generally allowed to \nspeak or meet with Burnett in Texas.  On one occasion, Signal representatives informed Plaintiff \nSatheesh Kannan Marimuthu that he could not m eet with Burnett be cause it would โvio late \ncompany policy.โ  When Plaintiff Muruganandam Arumugam attempted to speak with Burnett, \nhis calls went unreturned.   \n133.  Upon information and belief, on another oc casion, an Indian worker m ade a call \nto Burnett f rom the public telephone at the  Texas Labor Ca mp to schedule a meeting.  The \nreceptionist at Burnettโs office told the person that any S ignal employees who attended such a  \nmeeting would have to pay $100 each to meet with Burnett.   \n134.  Moreover, when questioned by certain Indi an workers abo ut the possibility of  \nobtaining trafficking visas, Burnett represented to Indian workers that he did not know of anyone \nwho had ever received a trafficking visa, and, thus, that the Indian workers would not be able to \nprocure a trafficking visa.  Upon infor mation and belief, Burnett attempted to dissuade certain \nIndian clients from applying for these visas in order to benefit Signal. \n- 27 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 28 of 82 PageID #:  854\n135.  In contrast to his reluctance to co mmunicate with Plain tiffs and other Indian  \nworkers, and in contrast to his failure to provide Plaintiffs accurate information regarding their \nimmigration status, Burnett actively engaged with Defendants and continued to represent Signal \nin connection with the Indian workers.  Upon information and belief, Burnett continued to advise \nSignal on issues regarding the Indian workers and  attended meetings with certain of the Indian \nworkers at Signalโs request. \n136.  Burnett displayed a contemptuous attitude toward his Indian  clients, which was \ndemonstrated by the multitude of derogatory comments Burnett made about them.  For example, \non one occasion, Burn ett described his Indian  clientsโ comm unication style as a โba mboo \nphone.โ   \n137.  On another occasion, when his Indian clients requested original documents rather \nthan copies of those docum ents, Burnett referred  to the clients as โdolts,โ asking, โWhat canโt \nyou make the dolts understand ?โ and signing the em ail as โ[c]onfused and pissed.โ  ( David v. \nSignal International, LLC, No. 08-1220, ECF No. 994-9 at 7.) \n138.  Outside of his representation of Plaintiffs, Defendants Pol and Burnett played and \ncompared scores achieved on the video ga me โBorder Patrol,โ a game hosted on a well-known \nwhite supremacist website where the object is for the player to kill und ocumented immigrants, \nincluding children.  (David v. Signal International, LLC, No. 08-1220, ECF No. 994-10 at 26.)   \n139.  Burnett (and the other Defendants) viewed  the Indian workers  as an exploitable \nsource of fees.  This was poignantly displayed  in an email Burnett sent to Dewan and Pol on \nDecember 16, 2006, reg arding a Signal worker and cl ient of Burnett.  The worker/clien t had \nstopped payment on a check to Burnett, and B urnett told Dewan and Pol to ensure that โthe \nidiotโ res tores the pay ment and t hreatened to  have the worker/clientโs visa โmysteriouslyโ  \n- 28 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 29 of 82 PageID #:  855\nrevoked if he did not pay.  Later in the em ail, Burnett referred to all the Indian workers, who \nwere his clients, as โthe idio tsโ and speculated about whether  he should threaten them  with \nโimmediate deportationโ in order to prevent them from stopping payment on future checks.   \n140.  Likewise, Burnett recommended to the Agen ts that they refuse to provide an \nIndian applicant with a refund des pite the fact  that his father was dying with cancer, stating \nโ[w]e did the work; we need to get paid.โ  ( David v. Signal International, LLC , No. 08-1220, \nECF No. 994-10 at 29.)  \n141.  To be sure, Burnett continued to engage  in conduct that was tortious, perpetuate \nDefendantsโ fraudulent scheme, and violate the oblig ations owed to Plaintiffs after they arrived \nin Texas. \n142.  As discussed above, Burnett continued to have an attorney-client relationship with \nPlaintiffs and other Indian workers, but failed  to disclose and obtain waivers for his attorney-\nclient relationship with other Defendants.  Ind eed, Burnett actively prom oted the inte rests of \nDefendants over those of Plaintiffs. \n143.  Further, once Plaintiffs were in Texas,  Burnett failed to p rocess Plaintiffs for \ngreen cards, failed to disclose that Signal was not going to process them for green cards, failed to \nprovide them with critical information regarding their immigration status, and failed to refund \nany of the fees Plaintiffs paid him. \n144.  Finally, upon information and belief, Burnett participated in meetings with Signal \nand certain Indian workers in Texas during wh ich the Te xas workers were threa tened with \ndeportation if they engaged in or ganizing efforts similar to the  Indian workers in Mississipp i.  \nDuring that meeting, Signal again represented that it would file  for green cards on the workersโ \nbehalf. \n- 29 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 30 of 82 PageID #:  856\n145.  Ultimately, Plaintiffs suffered the injury from Burnettโs conduct in Texas. \nSignal Subjected Plaintiffs to Degrading and Discriminatory Conditions at the Texas Labor \nCamp \n146.  Signal assigned Plaintiffs to work at its facility in Orange, Texas, and reside at the \nTexas Labor Camp, a crowded โman campโ consisting of trailer-like bunkhouses surrounded by \nbarbed-wire fences and accessible only by a guarded entrance.  When Plaintiffs Satheesh Kannan \nMarimuthu, Muruganandam Arumugam, and Muralidharan Arumugam first saw the Texas Labor \nCamp, they thought it was a prison. \n147.  Signalโs lack of regard for the Indian workers was demonstrated in internal emails \nthat ridiculed aspects of  Indian culture and relayed anti-immigrant sentiments.  For exam ple, \nSignal (a) referred to an Indian  worker as a โf*****g Keralite,โ (b)  stated that it intended to go \non a โrat huntโ to expose Indian workers who spoke out against Signal, (c) called Indian workers \nโchronic โWhiners,โโ and (d) joke d about setting up an arena and  taking bets on fights between \nIndian workers.  (David v. Signal International, LLC, No. 08-1220, ECF Nos. 994-15 at 32, 994-\n14 at 37, 994-10 at 75, and 994-15 at 43-44.) \nIsolated Living Conditions \n148.  The Texas Labor Camp was located m iles away from  shopping, p laces of  \nworship, public transportation, or residen tial communities.  This re mote location was chosen \npurposefully by Signal to keep the P laintiffs and other foreign workers segregated from the rest \nof Orange, Texas.  In fact, Signalโs workers and management went so far as to refer to the Texas \nLabor Camp as a โreservation.โ \n149.  The Texas Labor Camp gates were m onitored by security guards retained by \nSignal.  Signalโs security guards required Plaintiffs to show employee identification badges and \n- 30 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 31 of 82 PageID #:  857\nrecorded the time when Plaintiffs entered and  exited the Texas Labor Camp.  Signalโs security \nguards also searched Plaintiffsโ packages and bags when they entered the Texas Labor Camp. \n150.  The Indian workers were not perm itted to receive visitors in the Texas Labor \nCamp. \n151.  Signal did not require any of its non-Indian  employees to live in the s egregated \nโman camps.โ \n \n \nOvercrowded and Unsanitary Bunkhouses \n152.  Signal packed up to 24 m en into each bunkhouse, in two-tiered bunk b eds.  The \nbunkhouse was so congested that it wa s difficult for workers to m ove about or even to sit up in \nbed, and any semblance of privacy was impossible. \n153.  Each of the bunkhouses contained workers who worked both day and night shifts, \nso Plaintiffs had dif ficulty sleeping due to th e constant noise and the com ings and goings of \nworkers from different shifts. \n154.  The bunkhouses contained insufficient toil ets and bathing facilities.  Each \nbunkhouse contained only one or two toilets, so Plai ntiffs had to endure long lines, unsanitary \nconditions, and plumbing problems.   \n155.  These conditions failed to m eet basic  requirements of habitability and, not \nsurprisingly, illness and disease were common. \nRotten Food \n- 31 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 32 of 82 PageID #:  858\n156.  Food at the Texas Labor Ca mp was not readily available.  Plaintiffs had to eat at \nSignalโs mess halls, which were only open during  limited hours. If the Indian workers arrived \nlate for a meal, they were often denied food. \n157.  What food the Indian w orkers received was often rotten and cam e from kitchens \nthat were n ot hygienic.  As a resu lt, the Indi an workers frequently becam e ill and som etimes \nrequired hospita lization.  Plaintif f Rajendran   Sappani, for exam ple, suffered fr om regular \nstomach ailments as a result of the poor food that required medicine to treat. \n158.  Further, Sig nal refused  to accommodate re ligiously-based dietary restrictions.   \nFor example, Plaintiff Moorthy Madhamuni is a vegetarian by religion.  He explained to Signalโs \nrepresentatives the f act that his re ligion required him to eat vegetarian, but they refused to \nprovide vegetarian food.  Like wise, Plaintiff Murganandam  Arumugam was forced to choose \nbetween eating food he was allergic to (lamb and goat), eating food which violated his religious \nbeliefs (beef and pork), or going hungry. \n159.  When Indian workers complained about not having enough clean plates on which \nto eat dinner, Signal responded, โGive them a paper plate that is firm enough to support the curry \nbut flimsy enough to make them have to work at it and bitch.โ \nSignal Charged Plaintiffs $1,050 per Month For These โAccommodationsโ \n160.  For the โprivilege โ of living in thes e deplorable conditions, Signal charged the \nIndian workers, including Plaintiffs, $35 pe r day (approxim ately $1,050 per m onth).  Signal \nfailed to inform most or all of the Plaintiffs of these fees during the recruitment process. \n161.  From this amount, $21 was allocated towards rent, and $14 towards food.  The fee \nwas deducted from Plaintiffsโ paychecks automatically with no ability to opt out. \n- 32 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 33 of 82 PageID #:  859\n162.  Upon information and belief, Signal paid  Indian workers a lower amount than \nSignal paid its non-Indian workers. \n163.  Some of the Indian workers com plained of the disgusting living conditions and \nrequested to move out of the Texas Labor Cam p.  Initially, Signal simply refused.  Eventually, \nSignal told workers that if  they tried to live outside the Texas Labor  Camp, Signal would still \ndeduct the $35 per-day labor camp fees from their wages.  Given their already substantial debts, \nPlaintiffs had no reasonable choice but to con tinue living in the Texas Labor Camp.  Whil e \nPlaintiffs were forced to pay these exorbitant  fees becaus e they had no reasonab le financial \nalternative, Signal made over $730,000 in profit from the Mississippi and Texas man camps in \njust one year. \n164.  Upon information and belief, Signal charge d Plaintiffsโ room and board in order \nto recoup the cost of building  the man camps.  So anxious was Signal to recoup those expenses, \nthat it even charged Plaintiff Muruganandam Arumugam for room and board while he was in the \nhospital recovering from an e mergency surgery.  Signal did not require non-Indian workers to \nlive at the Texas Labor Camp or to pay similar room and board expenses. \nContinuous, Abusive, and Discriminatory Supervision \n165.  Plaintiffs felt compelled to rem ain at the Tex as Labor Cam p, in part, because \nSignal created an environment of fear through constant, abusive, and discriminatory supervision. \n166.  Signalโs personnel and/or security guards  deprived Plaintiffs of any sense of  \nprivacy by conducting surprise searches of  the bunkhouse, searching workerโs personal \nbelongings, and even occasionally requiring that the Indian workers turn out their pockets.  Upon \ninformation and belief, non-Indian workers were not subject to similar treatment. \n- 33 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 34 of 82 PageID #:  860\n167.  As stated above, Signalโs security guards monitored Plaintiffs and required them \nto show id entification whenever th ey entered and exited the Texas L abor Camp and tracked  \nPlaintiffโs movements in and out of the camp.  Upon information and belief, non-Indian workers \nwere not subject to similar treatment. \n168.  Plaintiffs were subjected to โno visito rsโ and โno alcoholโ policies at the Texas \nLabor Camp.  Violation subjected the worker s to fines and suspension of work.  Upon \ninformation and belief, non-Indian workers were not subject to similar policies. \n169.  As stated above, Signal requ ired Plaintiffs and other  Indian workers to set up \ndirect deposit bank accounts upon arrival to the Texas Labor Camp, to which Signal maintained \naccess.  Plaintiffs reaso nably believed Signal c ould exert influence over  Plaintiffโs financial \narrangements.  Upon infor mation and belief, non -Indian workers were not subject to sim ilar \nrequirements. \n170.  The Indian workers, in cluding Plaintiffs, were often given m ore difficult and \ndangerous jobs than the other non-Indian Signal  workers.  They wer e required to clean their \nequipment after work hours, while non-Indian workers were permitted to clean their equipment \nduring the last 30 m inutes of their shift.  Indian  workers were forced to take rep eated โskills \ntestsโ that non-Indian workers  were not required to take.   And non-Indian w orkers were \npermitted to work more overtime hours than the Indian workers. \n171.  Signalโs personnel and superv isors frequently used offensive language while \nspeaking with or referring to Plaintiffs and ot her Indian workers, including making anti-Indian \ncomments.   \n172.  Signal threatened Plaintiffs and other Indian workers with deportation or adverse \nemployment actions if they di d not continue w orking for Signa l, did not work according to \n- 34 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 35 of 82 PageID #:  861\nSignalโs sp ecifications, or com plained about  the working and living conditio ns.  Upon \ninformation and belief, workers of non-Indian race,  ethnicity, and alienage were not treated this \nway. \nDefendantsโ Continued Misrepresentations, Omissions, and Coercive Conduct \n173.  At meetings with Signal personnel, Indi an workers voiced com plaints regarding \nthe discriminatory treatment to which they were being subjected.  When Signal did not respond \nto the workers complaints, Indian workers a t the Mississippi Labor Ca mp began m eeting to \ndiscuss how to persuade Signal to improve conditions at the camp, and began meeting with third \nparties to discuss how to address their concerns. \n174.  Upon inform ation and belief, Sig nal becam e aware of these m eetings and \ncontacted the Agents to express concern about worker organizing efforts.  Upon information and \nbelief, Defendants met and decide d on a course of action regardi ng steps to be taken to quell \nfurther worker organization efforts.  The deci ded course of action was intended to have a \ndeterrent effect on other Indian workers that might attempt to exercise their rights. \n175.  Consistent with Defendantsโ plan,  on March 8, 2007, Signal m anagement met \nwith Indian workers at the Miss issippi Labor Camp and inform ed them that it would fight back \nagainst any โorganizing โ efforts, and that Si gnal would not extend any of the wor kersโ H-2B \nvisas if a single worker took legal action against Signal. \n176.  On March 9, 2007, Signalโs agents took five  of the more vocal Indian workers at \nthe Mississippi Labor Cam p into โcustody,โ fired  them, and informed them that they would be \ndeported.  Distraught at what that meant for him and his family, one of the workers attempted to \ncommit suicide.  Dem onstrative of Defendantsโ disregard for the Indian workers, in a m edia \n- 35 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 36 of 82 PageID #:  862\ninterview, Signalโs CEO referred to the suicide  attempt as โtheatrics, a bunch of  nonsense.โ  \n(David v. Signal International, LLC, No. 08-1220, ECF No. 994-8 at 12.) \n177.  Later that same day, Plaintiffs learned about the events at the Mississippi Labor \nCamp.  Plaintiffs and other Indi an workers becam e frightened by  these activities, particula rly \nwhen word spread  th at Sign al h ad im prisoned Ind ian workers  in Miss issippi who had \ncomplained about the working conditions and that  one worker attempted suicide rather than be \ndeported and face the debts that he had incurred in India in order to come to Signal. \n178.  Plaintiffs reasonably feared that if they tried to  leave Signalโs employ or oppose \nthe conditions at the Texas Labor Cam p, including by consulting with counsel, Plaintiffs would \nface forced deportation, physical restraint and detention, or other serious harms and/or abuses of \nthe legal process at the hands of Signal. \n179.  In addition, throughout the spring and  summer of 2007, S ignal representatives \nheld meetings with Plaintiffs and other workers to discuss the status of Plaintiffs and other Indian \nworkersโ visas.  Through its agents, Signal continued to represent that it would arrange for H-2B \nvisa extensions.  At no point during these m eetingsโindeed, at no point prior to term inationโ\nwere Plaintiffs informed that they would not be receiving green cards. \n180.  Signal was, in fact, evaluating the work ers, including Plaintiffs, and had no \nintention of applying for visa extensions for all of the workers or applying for green cards for the \nworkers. \n181.  At various tim es, Signal refused to c onfirm whether it ha d obtained visa \nextensions for Plaintiffs.  As a result, Pla intiffs felt further compelled to continue to work f or \nSignal and live at the T exas Labor Ca mp.  U pon information and belief, Signal prevented or \n- 36 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 37 of 82 PageID #:  863\nattempted to prevent Indian wo rkers, including Plaintiffs, from  consulting with lawyers about \ntheir situations. \n182.  Despite many promises to do so, Defenda nts never provided the green cards or \npermanent residency.  In fact, no Defendant ever ev en applied for a green card for any Plaintiff.   \nAnd, despite contractual provisions that clearly require them to do so, Defendants have failed to \nrefund any of the money Plaintiffs paid to them for green card and visa processing. \nPlaintiffs Relied on Defendantsโ Representations \nSatheesh Kannan Marimuthu \n183.  In or around Septem ber 2006, while worki ng as a fitter in Singapore, Satheesh \nKannan Marim uthu (โSatheeshโ) le arned of an opportunity to work in the United States.   \nSpecifically, Satheesh s aw advertisements in three n ewspapers, Dinamalar, Dhinathanthi and \nThe Hindu, stating that fitters and welders were needed in the United States.  The advertisements \nfurther stated that applicants would be eligib le for a visa and a green card and  instructed \ninterested parties to contact Dewan. \n184.  In or around December 2006, Satheesh called Dewan, who confirmed that he was \nassisting in the hiring of  fitters and welders for positions in the United States.  During this call \nDewan explained that Satheesh would need to take a test at De Silva Engineering and that if he \npassed, he would get in an interview and that Dewan would begin processing his H-2B visa and \ngreen card.  Dewan also said there would be a  service charge of eight lakhs (approxim ately \n$18,000). \n185.  Satheesh called Dewan twice in January  2007 to confirm  that there w as a job \nvacancy for him and that he would  get a g reen card.  Sath eesh explained that he h ad a stable \nwell-paying job in Singapore that he was unwilling to relinquish unless he had a job and a green \n- 37 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 38 of 82 PageID #:  864\ncard lined up. Dewan told Satheesh that it was  one hundred percent certain that Satheesh would \nreceive a green card and that Sa theesh should not pass up the rare  opportunity to move to the \nUnited States with his family.  Dewan stated that Pol and Burnett would work to ensure Satheesh \nreceived a green card. \n186.  Only after Dewan promised a green card and the fitter job in the United States did \nSatheesh resign his fitter job in Singapore.  \n187.  In January 2007, Satheesh returned to I ndia to take the test at De Silva  \nEngineering.  At this  time, Dewan stated tha t Satheesh n eeded to p ay the eight-lakh servic e \ncharge and make two demand drafts of $5,000 eac hโone payable to Michael Pol and the o ther \npayable to Malvern Burnett. Dewan stated that th e demand drafts were to cov er attorneysโ fees \nand that this payment would ensure Satheesh received a green card.   \n188.  After Satheesh passed the test at De Silva Engineering, Dewan and his employee, \nSalimon, informed Satheesh that he also needed to pay $1,000 for visa stam ping at the embassy \nand an additional $400 for โm edical feesโ before  he could begin working in the U nited States.  \nSatheesh was instructed to contact Salimon only after he had compiled the necessary funds.  \n189.  To compile the funds demanded by Dewan, Satheesh was forced to pawn family \njewelry, borrow $10,000 at a high  interest rate from  private  lenders, and withdraw his lif e \nsavings of $4,000. \n190.  After Satheesh notified Salimon that he had funds sufficient to pay the recruiting \nfees, Salimon instru cted Satheesh to com e to hi s office in Chennai, India to m ake the first \npayment of $1,000, which Satheesh  did.  Salimon  accepted the money on behalf of Dewan and \nagain confirm ed that Satheesh  would receive a  green card in exchange for the paym ent.  \nSatheesh requested a receipt for his payment, which Salimon refused to provide.   \n- 38 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 39 of 82 PageID #:  865\n191.  After receiving the payment from Satheesh, S alimon filled out th e paperwork \nSalimon stated was necessary for visa processing and notified Satheesh that he was scheduled for \nan interview at the United States Consulate in  Chennai about three days later. Salim on called \nSatheesh two days after the interview to inform him that Satheeshโs visa had been approved and \nthat Salimon was holding Satheeshโs passport.   \n192.  Salimon eventually notif ied Satheesh that  his flight to the United States would \nleave from Mumbai on February 15, 2007.  Sath eesh was instructed to bring funds for the \nremaining recruitm ent fees to Dewanโs office.   W hen he arrived, Dewan took Satheeshโs \npayment, but again refused to provide receipts.  Only after taking the payment did Dewan return \nSatheeshโs passport. \n193.  Satheesh departed India for the United  States on February 15, 2007.  A Signal \nemployee picked Satheesh and others up from  the airport in Houston, Texas and brought them \ndirectly to the Texas Labor Ca mp.  Satheesh thought the labor camp was a prison the first tim e \nhe saw it.  \n194.  Prior to re ceiving Satheeshโs payments, Dewan and Salimon represented that \nSatheesh would be living in an apartment with two to three other workers when he arrived in the \nUnited States.  Dewan and Salim on represented that Satheeshโs living conditions in the United \nStates would be as good as, or better than, hi s living conditions in Singapore.  A s discussed \nabove, the living conditions were far from what was promised. \n195.  In addition, Signal supervisors regularl y made racial and ridiculing comm ents \nabout the Indian workers, including Satheesh, and gave the most  difficult and dangerous jobs to \nIndian workers.   \n- 39 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 40 of 82 PageID #:  866\n196.  Signal employees further threatened that if Satheesh left the labor camp he would \nbe fired and that Signal would stop processi ng his immigration status.  Because of these \nstatements, and his debt in India, Satheesh felt  trapped, that could leave the Texas L abor Camp, \nand that he could not leave Signalโs employ. \n197.  In March 2007, Signal held a m eeting at which Satheesh and other workers were \ntold that they had to stay in  the labor camp and that they c ould only eat the food cooked at the \ncamp.  Signal representatives stated that anyone who did not comply with these rules would lose \ntheir job and be deported. \n198.  In April 2007, Signal held another m eeting, during which they notified Satheesh \nand others that only som e of  the workers would have their visa s renewed.  Signal stated that \nthose workers whose visas had not been renewed would be deported.   \n199.  Because Signal and Dewan frequently represented that Michael Pol and Malvern \nBurnett were Satheeshโs lawyers for immigration matters, Satheesh requested to speak with  \nand/or meet with Mich ael Pol and  Malvern Burn ett.  Sig nal employees refused, stating th at \nSatheeshโs request would violate company policy. \n200.  Defendants have never returned any of  the โrecru itment feesโ incurred by  \nSatheesh and never provided a green card for Satheesh or his family. \n201.  Satheesh relied upon D efendantsโ promises of perm anent residency, long-term \nemployment, and good working c onditions.  He would not have in curred subs tantial debt,  \nrelinquished prior em ployment, or agreed to wo rk for Si gnal in the absence of such false \npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal wou ld attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \n- 40 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 41 of 82 PageID #:  867\npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees, Satheesh felt in timidated into acqu iescence and compelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \nBalamurugan Marimuthu \n202.  Balagmurgan Marimuthu (โMarimuthuโ) is from Trichy, India.  In or around \nAugust 2006, he saw an advertisem ent for a job  opportunity for welders and fitters in the \nnewspaper Dinamalar. \n203.  Interested in the possibility of additional income, Marimuthu traveled to Chennai, \nIndia to interview for the position.  At the interview, Pol and Dewan told Marimuthu he must pay \n20,000 rupees (approxim ately $450) as an interv iew fee and for a m edical exam ination.  \nMarimuthu declined to pay the fee. \n204.  Shortly after the interview, howeve r, Marimuthu saw a second advertisem ent in \nDinamalar.  The advertisem ent promised employment in the United S tates and green cards for  \nthe workers and their families.  Marimuthu was extremely interested in the possibility of working \nin the United States and receiving green cards for himself and his family. \n205.  The advertisem ent indicated that inte rested applicants should appear on \nNovember 8, 9, or 10 at De Silva  Engineering in Chennai, India  for an interview.  Marimuthu \nagain travelled to Chennai and interviewed on November 8, 2006. \n206.  At the interview, Marimuthu learned th at the job opportunity was with Signal \nInternational.  Pol, Dewan, Burnett, and repr esentatives from Signal attend ed this inte rview \nsession, along with 40 to 50 potential workers. \n207.  During the interview, Pol and Burnett asked Marim uthu about his previous work \nexperience.  Marim uthu explained his prior work experience in  Singapore, and described the \naccommodations, food, and benefits that were  provided by the em ployer. Pol and Burnett \n- 41 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 42 of 82 PageID #:  868\npromised that Signal would provide the sam e type of accommodations, food, and benefits.   \nConsistent with the  advertisement, Pol and  Burnett also promised that Signal w ould provide \ngreen cards for Marimuthu, his wife, and his daughter. \n208.  Subsequently, one of Signalโs representatives administered a test to Marimuthu to \ndetermine his capabilities as a fitter, which Marimuthu passed. \n209.  After he passed the test, Dewan and his employee, Salimon, informed Marimuthu \nand the other workers who passed the test that  they would enter the United S tates on an H-2B  \nvisa and would be processed for a green card once they arrived in the United States. \n210.  Dewan then told the workers that th is opportunity w ould cost 8 lakhs \n(approximately $18,000) and represented that this  fee would be used for processing of the  \nworkersโ green cards. \n211.  Dewan told Marimuthu he would have to make an initial deposit of 35,000 rupees \n(approximately $787), and then pay Pol and Burn ett $5,373 each by dem and draft.  Marimuthu \nunderstood that Burnett was an American lawyer that was assisting him with obtaining his green \ncard, among other things. \n212.  Based on the rep resentations from  Dewan, Pol, and B urnett, including the \nrepresentations about receiving a green card for  himself and his family, Marimuthu was willing \nto pay the required recruitm ent fees.  To  that end, on Novem ber 14, 2006, Marim uthu paid \napproximately 35,000 rupees he had saved from his work in Singapore. \n213.  Marimuthu knew he would need to interv iew at the United States Cons ulate to \nwork for Signal.  He asked Dewan when his inte rview with the Consulate would be, but he was \ntold he first had to pay an additional two lakhs (approximately $4,500). \n- 42 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 43 of 82 PageID #:  869\n214.  Marimuthu did not have enough m oney to pay the additional fee and believed it \nwould take him about three years to earn one la kh in India.  As a result, he borrowed m oney \nfrom his father and a Tamil Nadu society.  As collateral for the latter loan, Marimuthu provided \nhis wifeโs jewelry (despite deep sentimental and cultural value). \n215.  Marimuthu also borrowed four lakhs (approximately $9,000) from his uncle at a \nsignificant monthly interest rate.  As collateral, Marimuthu offered title to his house.  Marimuthu \nonly agreed to these terms because he believed he would be able  to pay his uncle back quickly \nonce Marimuthu arrived in the United States. \n216.  Pol and Burnett scheduled Marimuthuโs interview at the Consulate for Decem ber \n4, 2006 in Chennai. \n217.  Prior to the interview, on Dece mber 3, 2006, Salimon meet with Marimuthu and \ncoached him on what to say during the interview. \n218.  Marimuthu attended the Consulate interv iew on December 4 and was approved \nfor a visa.  The Consulate inform ed Marimuthu that his passport would be sent to his hom e by \ncourier and gave Marimuthu a courier receipt. \n219.  After the interview, Marimuthu met Salimon at a hotel in Chennai.  Salimon took \nMarimuthuโs paperwork, including the courier receipt for the passport.  Salimon told Marimuthu \nhe would keep Marimuthuโs passport, and that he  would call when the visa in the passport was \nstamped.  Salimon did not return Marimuthuโs passport after it was stamped with the visa. \n220.  On December 8, 2006, Salim on instructed Marimuthu to take out dem and drafts \nfor Pol and Burnett.  Salim on also inf ormed Marimuthu his f light to the United  States was \nbooked for December 13, 2006. \n- 43 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 44 of 82 PageID #:  870\n221.  Believing that he would receive a green  card for him self and his fa mily, \nMarimuthu obtained tw o demand drafts payable to Pol and Burnett, each in the a mount of \n$5,373.00 (upon information and belief, these dem and drafts were required to be paid in Unite d \nStates dollars).  Marimuthu wrote in the memo line of the drafts โgreen card fees.โ   He paid an  \nadditional six lakhs (approximately $13,500) to Dewan in cash. \n222.  Two days before leaving for Chennai, Salimon contacted Marimuthu and told him \nhe would need to arrange and pa y for his travel from  Trichy to  Chennai, as well as pay for \nmedical testing.  Marimuthu had not been previously informed that he would be responsible for \nthese travel and m edical fees, which totale d about 15,000 rupees (a pproximately $337).   \nMarimuthu told Salim on he did not believe he  should have to pay these fees.  S alimon told \nMarimuthu that if he did not, Signal would cancel his flight to the United States and Marimuthu \nwould forfeit the payments he had already made.  Marimuthu felt threatened, and he worried that \nhe might lose his money and the opportunity to work in the United States on a green card.  As a \nresult, he received a last-minute loan from a distant relative for the additional 15,000 rupees. \n223.  On December 12, 2006, Marim uthu travelled to Chennai.  From  there, Salimon \ngave Marimuthu a plane ticket to Mumbai. \n224.  When he arrived at Dewanโs office in Mumbai, Marimuthu attempted to negotiate \nwith Dewan about reducing his recruitment fees, instead of charging the full eight lakhs.  Dewan \nthreatened to cancel Marimuthuโs plane ticket if he did not pay the full amount. \n225.  Fearful that he would forfeit the money he had already paid and the opportunity to \nreceive a green card, M arimuthu made the final pa yments.  He also paid an additional fee of \n2,500 rupees (approximately $56) f or a m edical certificate that S ignal said he would need to \n- 44 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 45 of 82 PageID #:  871\nenter the U nited States.  Af ter these paym ents, Marimuthu was f orced to sign several f orms, \nwhich were in English, without adequate time to read and understand the forms. \n226.  On December 13, 2006, Marim uthu traveled from  Mumbai to Houston, Texas.   \nUpon arriving in Houston, a Signal representative  drove Marimuthu to the Texas L abor Camp.  \nAs described above, the conditions at the la bor camp were horrid.  Marim uthu was shocked \nbecause he had been promised that the living conditions while working for Signal would be the \nsame as those he described in Singapore. \n227.  Marimuthu felt compelled to rem ain at the Texas Labor Ca mp and work for  \nSignal because of the d ebt he had incurred to p ay the recruiting fees and because he believed \nthat, if he did so, Signal would obtain a green card for him and his family.   \n228.  Marimuthu also felt compelled to remain at the Texas Labor Cam p and work for \nSignal, because Signalโs employees and representatives threatened to deport workers if they did \nnot do their jobs properly or if they tried to leave Signal. \n229.  In September 2007, Signal held a m eeting for the workers.  Signal told the \nworkers that they were going to apply for one more H-2B visa extension, but that they would not \nbe receiving the prom ised green c ards.  This  was the f irst time that Signal ev er informed \nMarimuthu that it was not providing the promised green cards. \n230.  True to form, neither Signal nor any of  the other Defendants ever provided or \napplied for a green card for Marimuthu or his fa mily.  Nor did they ev er return any of the \nrecruitment fees incurred by Marimuthu. \n231.  Marimuthu relied upon Defendantsโ prom ises of permanent residency, long-term \nemployment, and good working c onditions.  He would not have in curred subs tantial debt,  \nrelinquished prior em ployment, or agreed to wo rk for Si gnal in the absence of such false \n- 45 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 46 of 82 PageID #:  872\npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal wou ld attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees, Marimuthu felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \nMuruganandam Arumugam \n232.  In or around May 2006, Muruganandam  Arumugam (โMuruganandamโ) learned \nof advertisem ents in two newspapers,  Dinathandhi and   The Hindu , stating that fitters and \nwelders were being recruited to w ork in the  United States.  The a dvertisements instructed \ninterested parties to contact Sachin Dewan and his company Dewan Consultants. \n233.  Muruganandam was working as a welder in Singapore, but he was excited about \nthe opportunity to live and work in the United St ates.  He contacted Dewan.  De wan informed \nhim that welding jobs were available in the United States and that Dewan could help him secure \nsuch a position.  Dewan told Muruganandam  that he would need to pass  a welding test at De \nSilva Institute before he would be considered for any positions. \n234.  Muruganandam traveled over 800 kilom eters on four separate occasions to \nparticipate in the we lder recruitment process.  During one of these trips, Muruganandam  met \nwith Pol, Burnett and Dewan.  At this m eeting, Muruganandam was inform ed that, if he was \nselected, he would definitely receive a green car d after he was hired for the welding job in the \nUnited States.  He was al so repeatedly assured that his family would eventu ally be able to join \nhim in the United States and that his living conditions in the United States would be better than \nin Singapore, where Muruganandam lived in a private apartment with his wife and kids. \n235.  Dewan also told Muruganandam  that he w ould have to pay a service charge of \neight lakhs (approxim ately $18,000)  to Dewan Consultants to secure a green card and the \n- 46 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 47 of 82 PageID #:  873\nwelding job in the United States.  Of this  amount, 35,000 rupees was due as a deposit before \nDewan would arrange the necessary interview with the United States Consulate in Chennai. \n236.  After Muruganandam passed his welding test s, he was instructed to wait two to  \nthree months for a phone call from Dewan, which would inform him that it was time to interview \nat the U.S. Consulate.  During  this time Muruganandam returned to  his stable welding job in  \nSingapore which paid 750 Singapore dollars per week (approximately $540). \n237.  Eventually, Muruganandam was inform ed that it was tim e to return to India to  \nparticipate in the Consulate interview.  Muruganandam was instructed to bring the initial deposit \nof 35,000 rupeesโnearly his entire life savings โto Chennai.  As instructed, Muruganandam \npaid the money to Dewan, Burnett, and Pol. \n238.  After that meeting, Dewanโs employee, Salimon, provided Muruganandam  with \npaperwork to bring to the Cons ulate for the interv iew he arranged.  During the interview, \nMuruganandam was informed that he could not get a visa through the Consulate in India because \nhe was a permanent resident of Singapore.  Mu ruganandam relayed this information to Dewan, \nwho informed him that he would need to make an additional deposit of 165,000 rupees ($3,712) \nin order to continue the process.  \n239.  To com pile the funds dem anded by Dewan, Muruganandam  had to borrow \n165,000 rupees from  his m other-in-law.  In  late November 2006, Muruganandam  paid this  \nmoney to Salimon in Chennai.  Salim on provided additional documentation to Muruganandam \nand instructed him to attend an inte rview at the U.S. Consulate in Singapore, which eventuall y \ngranted Muruganandam a visa. \n240.  Because Muruganandam could not complete the welding tests, meet with Dewan \nand Signalโs agents, and attend interviews at  consulates in India and Singapore while also \n- 47 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 48 of 82 PageID #:  874\nworking a full tim e job, he was forced to relin quish a stable, well-paying job in S ingapore to \npursue the position with Signal.   \n241.  Salimon instructed Muruganandam to gather the remaining 600,000 rupees.  To \ndo so, Muruganandam was forced to borrow the additional funds from his mother-in-law. \n242.  When Muruganandam notified Salimon that he had the 600,000 rupees, Salim on \ninstructed him to get on a plane from Chennai  to Mumbai, which was leaving in a m atter of \nhours, and to report to Dewanโs office. \n243.  Once in Mumbai, Muruganandam went to Dewanโs office as instructed.  While in \na sm all room , surrounded by  several intim idating people who worked for Dewan, \nMuruganandam paid the additional rupees to Dewan.  He also signed various documents written \nin English that he did not understand. \n244.  Only after Muruganandam paid the 600,000 rupees did Dewan give \nMuruganandamโs passport back to him .  De wan then provided Muruganandam  with a plane \nticket to the United States which was scheduled to leave in a matter of hours. \n245.  Murganandam departed India for the United States on February 1, 2007.  A Signal \nemployee drove Murganandam and others from th e airport in Houston, Texas directly to the \nTexas Labor Camp.  The first time he saw it, Murganandam thought the labor camp was a prison. \n246.  Dewan had represented that Murgana ndamโs liv ing con ditions in  the United  \nStates would be as good as, or better than, hi s living conditions in Singapore.  A s described \nabove, however, the living conditions were reprehensible, and Murganandam was forced to live \nin one of the labor campโs crowded trailers. \n247.  As Signal was using two or three traile rs in the Labor Ca mp for  storage, \nMurganandam and other workers asked if the equipment could be moved to allow the workers to \n- 48 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 49 of 82 PageID #:  875\nspread out and have more sanitary living conditions.  Signal refused to move the equipment and \nlocked the trailer doors to prevent the workers fr om using the additional bathrooms and beds in \nthe storage trailers.   \n248.  Because Signal often served spoiled  food, or ran out of fish or chicken options,  \nMurganandam was forc ed to choose between eating food he was allergic to (lamb and goat), \neating food which violated his religious beliefs (beef and pork), or going hungry. \n249.  Signal supervisors also tr eated Indian workers, including Murganandam , far \nworse than the non-Indian workers.  For instance, the foreman regularly allowed the non-Indian \nworkers to clean their equipment during the final thirty minutes the workers were scheduled to \nwork each day.  Conversely, the Indian workers were required to clean their tools every day after \ntheir shift had ended, which amounted to approximately thirty minutes of unpaid work each day.  \nSimilarly, the fore man allowed the non-Indian wo rkers to work overtim e far m ore frequently \nthan the Indian workers. \n250.  Signal employees threatened that if Murganandam left the labor camp on his own \nhe would be fired and that Signal would stop pr ocessing his immigration status.  Based on these \nstatements and his deb t in Ind ia, Murganandam felt trapped.  He f elt that h e could leave the \nTexas Labor Camp or Signalโs employ. \n251.  Signal informed Murganandam that he could live outside of the Labor C amp, but \nthat he would still be responsible for paying  for the housing and food provided at the Labor \nCamp.  Murganandam  was never infor med that  Signal would charge him  for food or housing \nbefore he left India. \n252.  Signal only provided infrequent m eetings for em ployees to express their \ngrievances.  Nevertheless, Murganandam  could  not attend these m eetings because they were \n- 49 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 50 of 82 PageID #:  876\nalways conducted at 5:00 p.m., during Murganandamโs work shift.  Moreover, the meetings were \nineffectual for workers like Murganandam , because they were conducted in English and no \ntranslator was provided. \n253.  When Murganandam and a friend inquired  about the status of their visas and \ngreen cards, a Signal representative declined to discuss their status.  When Muruganandam called \nBurnett to discuss the status of his visa and green card, Burnett refused to return his calls. \n254.  Defendants have never returned any of  the โrecru itment feesโ incurred by  \nMurganandam and have never provided a green card for Murganandam or his family. \n255.  Murganandam relied upon Defendantsโ pr omises of perm anent residency, long-\nterm employment, and good working condition s.  He would not have incurred sub stantial debt, \nrelinquished prior em ployment, or agreed to wo rk for Si gnal in the absence of such false \npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal wou ld attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees, Murganandam felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled \nto continue working for Signal. \nMuralidharan Arumugam \n256.  In or around March 2006, Muralidhara n Arum ugam (โMuralidharanโ) saw \nadvertisements in two local newspapers for weld ing and fitting jobs in the United States.  The \nadvertisements indicated that interested parties should contact Dewan Consultants. \n257.  Around July 2006, Muralidharan attended a  meeting at Dewan Consultants.   \nSachin Dewan ran the m eeting with the assistan ce of Salimon, Pol and Burnett.  During this \nmeeting Muralidharan and the other attendees were advised that Signal had fitting and welding \njobs available in the United States.   The atte ndees were advised that  whoever secured a job \n- 50 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 51 of 82 PageID #:  877\nwould earn $18 per hour for 50 hours of work  per week, that food and lodging would be \nprovided, and that each worker would get a g reen card.  To  be considered for these positions, \nMuralidharan and the other attendees would  need to pass perform ance tests and pay \napproximately six lakhs (approximately $13,500). \n258.  Encouraged by the prospect of working  in the United States, Muralidharan took \nand passed the requisite tests right after the initial meeting at Dewan Consultants.  \n259.  Sachin Dewan said he would schedule a  visa interview for Muralidharan at the \nU.S. Consulate as soon as Muralidharan paid 1.5 lakhs (approximately $3,375). \n260.  In order to m eet Dewanโs demand, Mu ralidharan m ortgaged his fa milyโs \nagricultural land against his fatherโs wishes.  Muralidharan used the money he raised to pay 1.5 \nlakhs to Dewan for his Consulate interview. \n261.  Muralidharan successfully completed his Consulate interview around Novem ber \n2006.  Muralidharan prom ptly notified Dewan that  he had passed and that he was ready to \ncontinue with the process. \n262.  In or aroun d Decem ber 2006, Mu ralidharan attended a second m eeting with \nDewan Consultants.  D uring this meeting Muralidharan learned that the  cost to work in the  \nUnited States had increased to eight lakhs (app roximately $18,000), rather than the six lakhs he \nwas originally quoted. \n263.  At the same meeting, Dewan told Muralidharan that he needed to pay a second \ndeposit of $10,746 towards this am ount in the form of two $5,373 dem and draftsโone payable \nto Pol and the other payable to Burnett.  Dewa n represented that these paym ents would ensure \nthat Muralidharan received a green card, which would enable him to perm anently live and work \n- 51 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 52 of 82 PageID #:  878\nin the United States.  After receiv ing a letter  that confirmed he would receiv e a green card,  \nMuralidharan paid the second deposit of $10,476 on December 9, 2006. \n264.  To compile the funds demanded by Dewan, including the second deposit and the \nremaining amounts owed on the eight lakhs, Muralidharan mortgaged his fatherโs house, pawned \nhis wifeโs jewelry and took out private loans. \n265.  As soon as Muralidharan com piled the necessary funds, he traveled to Mum bai \nand paid the remaining portion of the eight la khs charged by Dewan.  After Muralidharan paid, \nDewan returned his passport and provided him with plane tickets for a flight to the United States \nthat departed the next day. \n266.  Muralidharan departed India for the Un ited States on or about December 11, \n2006.  A Signal em ployee drove Mura lidharan and others from  the airport in Houston, Texas \ndirectly to the Texas Labor Camp.  The first time he saw it, Muralidharan thought the camp was \na prison. \n267.  Prior to rec eiving his first paycheck, Muralidharan was not aware that Signal \nwould deduct money for room and board. \n268.  As described above, the liv ing conditions at the camp were reprehensible.  As a \nresult of over-crowding, unsanitary conditions,  and spoiled food, nume rous workers, including \nMuralidharan, became ill seriously while living in Signalโs Texas Labor Camp.   \n269.  Muralidharan contracted an intestinal vi rus or in fection while liv ing at Signalโs \nTexas Labor Camp and had to have e mergency surgery.  Muralidharan rem ained bedridden in \nthe hospital for four days following the surgery.   Muralidharan departed from the hospital early \nbecause he could not afford to stay as long  as he was advised to stay.  Mulihandharan โs \nhospitalization resulted in charges exceeding $30,000. \n- 52 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 53 of 82 PageID #:  879\n270.  Nonetheless, Signal continued to  charge Muralidharan for food and \naccommodations while he was in the hospital, unable to work. \n271.  As a result of the debt he had incurred to  pay the recruiting fees and the fees for \nhis hospitalization, as well as the promise of a green card, Muralidharan felt compelled to remain \nat Signal. \n272.  Defendants have never returned any of  the โrecru itment feesโ incurred by  \nMuralidharan and have never provided a green card for Muralidharan or his family. \n273.  Muralidharan relied upon Defenda ntsโ promises of per manent residency, long-\nterm employment, and good working condition s.  He would not have incurred sub stantial debt, \nmortgaged his familyโs land, or agreed to work for Signal in the absence of such false promises.  \nBecause of his fear that Signal  would attempt to deport him, his  fear of mistreatment and abuse \nby Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his fa mily had incurred to pay \nDefendantsโ recruiting fees, Muralidharan felt in timidated into acquies cence and compelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \nSatyanarayana Ellapu \n274.  In or around June 2006, while working as a  structural welder in Andhra Pradesh, \nIndia, Satyanarayana Ellapu (โSatyaโ) saw an advertisement in the local newspaper, Eenadu, for \npotential employment in the United States.  The advertisement stated that a โleading marine and \nfabrication company in Mississippi and Texasโ was hiring welders and pipefitters for its facilities \nin the United States and was conducting tests on June 25, 26, and 28, 2006, for the positions. \n275.  The advertisem ent also stated th at the positions m ay include โperm anent \nemployment visasโ and a โ2 years [sic] contract.โ \n- 53 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 54 of 82 PageID #:  880\n276.  Satya was hopeful that the job opportunity would better enable him to provide for \nhis family, for whom he was the sole breadwinner. \n277.  On June 26, 2006, Satya traveled  an hour from his village to a training center to \ntake a test to determ ine his eligib ility for hire at Signal.  Sachin Dewan and other S ignal \nrepresentatives were present at this  meeting, along with 20 to 30 other welders an d pipefitters.  \nSatya passed the test and was instructed to return in three days. \n278.  Three days  later, Satya return ed to the training cen ter an atte nded an \ninformational m eeting with approxim ately 50  other workers.  Dewan and Burnett led the \nmeeting.  Dewan inform ed the workers that th e opportunities were for position s in Signalโs \nfacilities in Mississippi or Texas.  Dewan furthe r informed the workers that they would receive \nan H-2B visa for the first 9 months of their employment with Signal, but that they would then be \nprovided a green card.  Dewan indicated that the  process would take four to six months and \nwould cost six lakhs (approximately $13,500), of which one lakh (approximately $2,250) had to \nbe paid up front. \n279.  Satya complained about the cost to Dewan and Burnett.  They informed Satya that \nhe had no choiceโโIf you want the job, you have to pay.โ  However, they also promised that the \nmoney would be โeasily recoveredโ once Satya began working in the United States. \n280.  In response to the workersโ concern a bout the size of th e up-front paym ent, \nDewan and Burnett stated that the workers could pay 20,000 rupees (approximately $450) within \n20 days and pay the balance later.  If the m en paid the 20,000 rupees, they would be guaranteed \nthe job. \n281.  Dewan and Burnett then distributed applications explaining that the worker had to \npay the recruiting fees in installments by demand drafts and cash. \n- 54 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 55 of 82 PageID #:  881\n282.  After the meeting, Satya returned to his village to discuss the opportunity with his \nfamily.  His fa mily did not have enough m oney cover the recruiting fees , but they nonetheless \nencouraged him to applyโbelieving that a green card would assist Satya in providing for them. \n283.  Because Satyaโs life savings totaled one lakh, he borrowed four and a half lakhs \n(approximately $10,125) from a lender with interest.   As collateral, Satya pledged his fatherโs \nancestral land and his hom e, which the lender  threatened to repossess if Satya m issed any \npayments. \n284.  On July 20, 2006, Sat ya met with an e mployee of Dewan to m ake his first \npayment of 20,000 rupees.  The employee gave Satya  four forms to sign.  The first form was for \nGlobal and explained the payment schedule and amounts.  The second form was for Burnett and \nexplained the attorneysโ fees for legal services, employment agreements, and labor certifications.  \nThe third form explained Dewanโs services.  Th e fourth form was an em ployment agreement \nwith Signal.  Satya signed the four forms, trusting that Dewan had accurately translated them. \n285.  Subsequently, Satya had several m eetings with Dewanโs empl oyees in which he \nwas asked to m ake additional payments, including fees for visa pro cessing, bank drafts, and \ntravel and accommodation in Chennai, where he interviewed with the United States Consulate. \n286.  Prior to Satyaโs interview with th e Consulate on Nove mber 3, 2006, Dewan \ncontacted him and requested that he bring documents evidencing his land or inheritance, which \nDewan claimed was necessary for the visa application.  Satya traveled to Chennai and m et with \nDewan two days before his interview with the Consulate. During this meeting, Dewan instructed \nSatya regarding what to say during the Consulate interview. \n- 55 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 56 of 82 PageID #:  882\n287.  After the Consulate granted Satyaโs visa , Dewan contacted Satya and infor med \nhim that he could leave for the United States as  soon as he m ade a final paym ent of six lakhs \n(approximately $13,500).  Satya also had to borrow the funds necessary to make that payment. \n288.  On December 12, 2006,  Satya trav eled to Mumbai to pick up his passport and \nplane ticket from Dewanโs office.  After colle cting Satyaโs fee paym ents, Dewan gave Satya a \nseries of forms in English to sign.  Satya aske d for a translation, but Dewan refused, citing th e \nworkersโ imminent plane departure.  Satya believed he had no choice but to sign the for ms even \nthough he could not read them. \n289.  After he signed the forms, Satya was given his plane ticket and passport.  Satyaโs \nplane left Mumbai shortly thereafter and arrived in Houston,  Texas on or about Decem ber 13, \n2006.  A Signal representative met Satya and other workers at the airport and drove them to the \nTexas Labor Camp. \n290.  The m orning following his arrival, Si gnal hosted an orientation for the new \nworkers.  D uring that m eeting, Satya learned for  the first tim e that he would need to pay an \nadditional $170 for his tools.  Sa tya was also forced to sign se veral more form s in English.   \nWhen Satya asked Signalโs representatives to explain what the forms said, they refused. \n291.  As a result of the conditions at the Texa s Labor Camp, Satya felt isolated, lonely, \nand anxious.  At one point, he was hospitalized w ith an eye injury resulting from the conditions \nin which he was forced to weld.  Satya did not complain, however, because he was fearful Signal \nwould terminate his employment if he did.  His fear was based in part upon news that (1) Signal \nhad threatened to deport a work er who refused to do a particular  job; and (2) another worker \nmissed two days of wor k and was forcibly depor ted by Signal.  Satya f elt further compelled to \n- 56 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 57 of 82 PageID #:  883\nstay at Signal, because he could not repay the debts he incurred for the recruitment fees if he left \nand believed he would receive a green card if he stayed. \n292.  Defendants have never returned any of  the โrecruitment feesโ incurred by Satya \nand never received provided a green card for Satya or his family. \n293.  Satya relied upon Defendantsโ prom ises of perm anent residency, long-term \nemployment, and good working c onditions.  He would not have in curred subs tantial debt,  \nrelinquished prior em ployment, or agreed to wo rk for Si gnal in the absence of such false \npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal wou ld attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees,  Satya felt intim idated into acquiescence and compelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \n \nMoorthy Nadhamuni \n294.  In November 2006, while Moorthy Nadham uni (โMoorthyโ) was working as a \nfitter in Dubai, he learned of a  job opportunity in the United States through an advertisement in \nthe Indian newspaper, Dinathandy.  The advertisement was placed by Dewan Consultants, stated \nDewan was seeking to f ill permanent job vaca ncies, and p romised employment in the United \nStates along with permanent residency through a green card. \n295.  As a result of the advertisem ent, Moorthy took an e mergency leave from  his \nposition in Dubai and travelled to  Chennai, India to attend an infor mational meeting about the \nopportunity. \n296.  Pol, Dewan, his em ployee Salimon, and othe rs were present at the m eeting.  \nDuring the m eeting, Dewan told Moorthy that he  had to pass a test, which cost 500 rupees \n- 57 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 58 of 82 PageID #:  884\n(approximately $11), to be eligible for potential employment.  Moorthy paid the 500 rupees and \npassed the test. Salim on contacted Moorthy three days later and  instructed him to attend an \nupcoming meeting. \n297.  Approximately one week later, Moor thy attended a general m eeting led by \nDewan.  Several other workers were  present.  Dewan inform ed the workers that they had been \nselected to work f or Signal Interna tional in th e United States at either a Texas or Mississipp i \nfacility, that workers w ould be paid $14-18/ho ur, and that the workers would receive green \ncards. \n298.  Dewan informed the workers  that they w ould first have to attend an interview  \nwith the United States Consulate in Chennai.  If the interview went well, the work ers would be \ngiven H-2B visa and would recei ve a green card approxim ately 18 months after working in the \nUnited States.  Dewan also promised the workers that, after they received their green cards, their \nfamilies could join them in the United States. \n299.  Dewan stated the green card processing  would cost the workers eight lakhs \n(approximately $18,000) in three installm ents.  First the workers had to pay Dewan 35,000 \nrupees (approximately $787).  Second, the workers would have to pay $3,871 to Pol and $3,871 \nto Burnett in cashierโs check by late January.   Finally, the workers would have to pay the \nremainder of the eigh t lakhs to  Dewan.  Dewan further stated  that the workersโ green cards \nwould be p rocessed and their f amilies could join them in the United  States, but only if  the \nworkers paid these fees. \n300.  Moorthy made the initial payment to Dewan with money he had saved from his \nprevious employment.  To accumulate the remainder of the eight lakhs, Moorthy borrowed funds \nfrom a local lender, pledging his wifeโs land as collateral, and pawned his wifeโs jewelry. \n- 58 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 59 of 82 PageID #:  885\n301.  After receiving Moorthyโs initial payment, Dewan inf ormed Moorthy that his \ninterview with the Con sulate was scheduled  for Decem ber 2, 2006.  Dewan also inform ed \nMoorthy that he must bring an additional 4,600 rupees (approximately $103) for visa processing. \n302.  On December 2, 2006, Moorthy arrived in Chennai.  He met with Dewan prior to \nhis interview, during which Dewan coached Moorthy regarding  the interview and provided him \nwith documents for the Consulate. \n303.  Moorthy was subsequently approved fo r a visa.  After the approval, Dewan \ninstructed Moorthy to make the final payment of $3,871 to both Pol and Burnett. \n304.  On approxim ately February 13, 2007, Moorthy m et Dewan in Chennai and \nreceived a ticket from Chenna i to Mum bai.  Dewan said that Moorthy would receive the \nremainder of his ticket to the United States in Mumbai. \n305.  On February 14, 2007, Moorthy travelled  from Chennai to Dewanโs office in \nMumbai.  There, he and several other worker s were called one by one to m ake their final \npayments to Pol, Burnett, and Dewan.  Som e workers were unable to m ake the payments and \nwere informed by Dewanโs representatives that  they would not receive plane tickets and would \nforfeit all prior payments if they did not make the final payment in full.  Having witnessed this, \nMoorthy felt com pelled to m ake his paym ents.  After m aking that paym ent, Moorthy was \nrequired to sign several forms in English, which Dewanโs representatives refused to translate. \n306.  On February 15, 2007, Moorthy departed Mu mbai for Houston, Texas.  When he \narrived in Houston, a Signal representative pi cked him up a t the airport and brought Moorthy \nalong with the other workers to the Texas Labor Camp. \n307.  Moorthy was appalled by the living c onditions, whichโas described aboveโ\nwere horrid.  They were m uch worse than the living conditions he had experienced previously \n- 59 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 60 of 82 PageID #:  886\nwhen working in Dubai and Singapore.  Signal  refused to serve vegetarian food, even though \nMoorthy is a vegetarian for religious reasons.  Meanwhile, Signal continued deducting fees from \nMoorthyโs paychecks for food and accommodations. \n308.  Moorthy felt trapped and believed that,  because of the debt he had incurred, he \nhad to continue working f or Signal despite the repreh ensible conditions.  In additio n, based on \nthe promises made to him previously, Moorthy also believed that he would receive a green card \nif he continued to work for Signa l and that his family could eventually join him in the United  \nStates.  Accordingly, Moorthy continued to work for Signal without complaint. \n309.  Defendants have never returned any of  the โrecru itment feesโ incurred by  \nMoorthy and never provided a green card for Moorthy or his family. \n310.  Moorthy relied upon Defendantsโ prom ises of perm anent residency, long-term \nemployment, and good working c onditions.  He would not have in curred subs tantial debt,  \nrelinquished prior em ployment, or agreed to wo rk for Si gnal in the absence of such false \npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal wou ld attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees,  Moorthy felt intim idated into acqu iescence and compelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \nRajendran Sappani \n311.  In 2006, R ajendran Sappani (โSappaniโ)  was working in Singapore when he  \nlearned about a newspaper advertisem ent pl aced by Dewan offering welders and fitters \nemployment and permanent residency in the United States. \n312.  Sappani learned that Dewan Consultants was holding interviews for the positions \nin Chennai, India, and that the last date to interview was November 11, 2006. \n- 60 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 61 of 82 PageID #:  887\n313.  On or around November 8, 2006, Sappani left his job in Singapore and returned to \nhis hometown of Trichy, India, be fore travelling to Chenna i for an interview and testing with \nDewan. \n314.  Sappani interviewed with Dewan and passed a written pipe  fitting test.  After the \ntest, Sappani he was required to pay eight la kh (approximately $18,000) for the employm ent \nopportunity, visa processing, and green card.  He was also required to make an initial payment of \n45,000 rupees to Dewan.  Dewan also informed Sappani he would need to pass an interview with \nthe Consulate and that,  if the  Consulate did not stam p his passport with a visa, Sappani would \nforfeit the 45,000 rupees payment. \n315.  To raise the funds necessary to pay  the recruitm ent fees, Sappani borrowed \nmoney from lenders.  T o obtain one of the loans, the lender required Sappani to prove that the \nfunds were for a green card.  Sappani contacted Dewan who faxed a letter to Sappani confirming \nthat Sappani would be receivi ng a green card.  Sappani presen ted the letter to the bank and  \nreceived the funds.  Sappani also sold his wi feโs jewelryโwith the exception of her wedding \nband, which he used as collateral for a loanโand  mortgaged his familyโs house and land.  As a \nresult, his family now pays 1,000 rupees per month to live in the house.   \n316.  Subsequently, Sappani attended an inte rview with the United Sta tes Consulate \nand was processed for a visa.  In December 2006, prior to leaving for the United States, Sappani \nwas instructed to trave l to Dewanโs of fice in Mumbai, where he paid the final recruiting fees, \nincluding an additional 1,500-rupee fee for a m edical certificate.  Dewan withheld Sappaniโs \npassport until the final paym ents were made.  Sappani was then required to sign several papers \nquickly, without an opportunity to read them, before he received his ticket to travel to the United \nStates. \n- 61 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 62 of 82 PageID #:  888\n317.  On or abou t December 18, 2006, Sappani ar rived at Sign alโs Orange, Texas \nfacility.  Sappani was shocked by the condition s at the Texas Labor Camp, which were m uch \nworse than he had experienced in Singapore.   But Sappani felt that he could not turn back \nbecause have no way of repaying the money he had borrowed.  As a result, Sappani was afraid to \ndo anything that might create problems for him at Signal. \n318.  Defendants have never returned any of the โrecruitment feesโ incurred by Sappani \nand never provided a green card for Sappani. \n319.  Sappani relied upon Defendantsโ prom ises of perm anent residency, long-term  \nemployment, and good working c onditions.  He would not have in curred subs tantial debt,  \nrelinquished prior em ployment, or agreed to wo rk for Si gnal in the absence of such false \npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal wou ld attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees,  Sappani felt intimidated into acquiescence and com pelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \nRajendran Subramani \n320.  Rajendran Subram ani  (โRajendranโ) is  a welder and structural fitter from \nTiruchirappali, India.  Rajendran supports his mother and family financially. \n321.  In or about 2006, Rajendran was working  as welder in Malaysia.  His friend \ninformed him about an advertisement in a Hindu newspaper offering the opportunity to live and \nwork in the United States as welder or fitter and obtain a green ca rd.  Rajendran reviewed the \nadvertisement and confirmed that it prom ised the opportunity to get a  green card in the United \nStates.  To take advantage of this opportunity,  Rajendran travelled to I ndia to interview for a  \nposition.    \n- 62 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 63 of 82 PageID #:  889\n322.  On or about January 7, 2007, Rajendran interviewed with Salim on, an employee \nof Dewan.  Rajendran understood that Dewan wa s recruiting workers on behalf of Signal.   \nDuring this interview, Salimon represented to Rajendran that he would make $18.00 per hour in \nthe United States, that there w ould be opportunities to receive  overtime pay, and the job with \nSignal would last for at least two years.  Salimon further represented Rajendran would initially \nreceive a visa every six  months, but that af ter two years Signal would get a green card for  \nRajendran and help him bring his family to the United Sates.   \n323.  Despite the fact that Rajendran had a two-year contract for his job in Malaysia, he \nwas very interested in obtaining a green card and earning an income that was higher than what he \nwas making in Malaysia.  Rajendran felt that this employment opportunity would permit him to \nmake a better life for his family and to support his aging mother. \n324.  During the interview, Rajendran spoke with Salimon about his work arrangement \nin Malaysia and described the  accommodations, food, and benefits  that were provided by the  \nemployer.  Salim on prom ised Rajendran that  Signal would provide sim ilar type of \naccommodations, food, and benefits, including that  he would only have to share an  apartment \nwith a few men. \n325.  Salimon told Rajendran that it would cost  him eight lahks for the opportunity to \nwork for Signal and receive a green card.  Base d on the representations that Salim on made on \nbehalf of Signal, including the representations a bout receiving a green card for him self and his \nfamily, Rajendran agreed to pay the money. \n326.  Rajendran had saved about 100,000 rupees  during his time working in Malaysia, \nbut still needed to borrow an additional 700,000 rup ees to pay the recruitment fee.  Rajendranโs \nmother used to work f or a wealth y family, the Muthus, who agreed to  loan Ra jendran the \n- 63 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 64 of 82 PageID #:  890\n700,000 rupees at an interest  rate of three percent (3%) per m onth, a total of thirty-six percent \n(36%) interest per year. \n327.  In or about January 2007, Rajendran paid  40,000 rupees ($900) to Salimon as an \ninitial deposit in orde r to obtain  an interview with the U.S. Consulate.  Approxim ately four \nweeks la ter, Salim on called  Rajen dran and  to ld him  that his interview was sc heduled f or \nFebruary 7, 2007.  Rajendran met with Salimon in Madras in order to coach him for interview. \n328.  Rajendran met with the em bassy on or  about February 7, 2007, and after the \nmeeting they told him that his passport would be sent to S alimon once it was stamped.  Several \ndays after the interview with  the embassy Rajendran received  a phone call from Dewan saying \nthat they had his passport, but that he needed to come to Dewanโs office in Bombay to pay the \nremaining 760,000 rupees, which he did prior to departing for the United States. \n329.  On February 15, 2007, Rajendran traveled  to the United States.  A  Signal \nemployee picked up Rajendran and other Indian  workers at the airport in Houston, Texas and \ndrove them to the Texas Labor Camp. \n330.  Rajendran thought that the Texas L abor Camp resembled a prisonโit was very \nisolated, it was surrounded by a fence, and guarded by security guards. \n331.  A Signal employee had Rajendran and other Indian workers complete paperwork \nwhen they arrived at the Texas Labor Cam p.  Signal did not, however, tr anslate or explain the \npaperwork for the Indian workers. \n332.  At the Texas Labor Cam p, Rajendran wa s required to shar e an overcrowded \nbunkhouse with more than twenty (20) men.   The bunk beds were so tightly packed together that \nRajendran and others were forced to sleep with their suitcases in their beds with them.  The toilet \nand showering facilities were insufficient and unsanitary.  Indeed, there was only bathroom and \n- 64 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 65 of 82 PageID #:  891\none shower between the twenty men.  There was no privacy at the bunkhouse and sleep was very \ndifficult due to the close quarters, oppressive  smells, and constant noise from  the workers \ncoming and going to their different shifts. \n333.  As described above, the food that Signal  provided was deplorable.  Rajendran \noften became ill from the food, which was freq uently rotten and/or left out for lon g periods of \ntime. \n334.  Signal deducted approximately $1,050 per month from Rajendranโs paychecks for \nroom and board.  Prior to arriving at the Texa s Labor Camp, Rajendran had not been infor med \nthis amount would be withheld from his paychecks.   \n335.  As a result of the conditions at the Texas Labor Ca mp, Rajendran asked Signal if \nhe could live somewhere else, but he was told  Signal would still deduct $1,050 per month from  \nhis paychecks if he m oved.  Because of the su bstantial debt Rajendran had incurred to pay th e \nrecruitment fees, he could not afford to pay  for accommodations outside the Texas Labor Camp \nand still pay Signal $1,050 per m onth.  Rajendran was, in effect, compelled to stay in the Texas \nLabor Camp. \n336.  Rajendran and other workers com plained to Signal about the awful conditions at \nthe Texas Labor Cam p.  In response, Signal th reatened to send Rajendran and other workers \nback to India if they continued to complain or spoke to others about Signalโs actions.  Faced with \nthreats of deportation, and crushing  debt in Indian, Rajendran fe lt compelled to continue his \nemployment at Signal.  \n337.  Notwithstanding the prior promises of employment for two years and a green card \nfor Rajendran and his family, during a meeting in June 2007, Signal informed Rajendran and the \nothers who voiced concern about the conditions at  the Texas Labor Camp that they could not \n- 65 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 66 of 82 PageID #:  892\nwork for Signal after July 30, 2007 and that Signal  would not renew their visas.  At that point, \nRajendran realized that the promises about the length of his employment and Signal obtaining a \ngreen card for Rajendran and his family were lies. \n338.  Defendants have never returned any of  the โrecru itment feesโ incurred by  \nRajendran and never provided a green card for Rajendran or his family. \n339.  Rajendran relied upon Defendantsโ prom ises of permanent residency, long-term \nemployment, and good working c onditions.  He would not have in curred subs tantial debt,  \nrelinquished prior em ployment, or agreed to wo rk for Si gnal in the absence of such false \npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal wou ld attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees,  Rajendran felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \nVenkata Satya Sivagi Rao Talabathulla \n340.  In or about May 2006, while working as a structural welder in Andhra Pradesh, \nIndia, Venkata Satya Sivagi Rao Talabathulla (โTalabathullaโ) saw an advertisement in the local \nnewspaper, Eenadu, for potential employment in the Unite d States.  The advertise ment stated \nthat an Americ an company was hiring welders  and pipefitters for its f acilities in the United  \nStates.  The advertisement gave certain dates fo r tests and interviews in Chennai, and provided \nthe contact information for Dewan. \n341.  Talabathulla and three of his friends  traveled to Chennai 16 hours by train to \ndiscuss the opportunity with Dewan.  Dewan expl ained the job opportunity, represented that it \nwas for long-term employment, that there was ample work, and that workers would be processed \nfor green cards.  Specifically, Dewan infor med Talabathulla that he would work under an H-2B \n- 66 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 67 of 82 PageID #:  893\nvisa for the initial nine m onths and then woul d be processed for and receive a green card.   \nDewan also explained that that Talabathulla w ould need to undergo a testing process that was \nbeing conducted over the next couple of days. \n342.  Dewan required that Talabathulla pay  two lakhs (approximately $4,500), within \n10 days to proceed.  Talabathulla needed to go back home to Andhra Pradesh in order to obtain \nthe money.  Before leav ing to obtain the m oney, Talabathulla took and passed the fitting test.   \nDuring the test, Talabathulla met Pol, who informed him that the job opportunity was for Signal.  \nPol reiterated the promise of permanent residency in the United States.  \n343.  Talabathulla paid two lakhs to Dewan in  November 2006.  In order to pay those \nfunds, Talabathulla had to borrow money from  his father, who in turn borrowed from lenders at \nan interest rate of 3% per month (43% per year). \n344.  After receiving Talabathullaโs paym ent, Dewan informed Talabathulla that h e \nneeded to pay an additional $5,373 to Malvern  Burnett, $5,373 to Michael Pol, and another \n$3,680 to Dewan.  Talabathulla ultim ately paid these am ounts.  To do so, Talaba thulla had to \nborrow more money from his father, who in turn borrowed the money from lenders, pledging his \nhouse as collateral for the loan. \n345.  In December 2006, Talabathulla traveled to Dewanโs office in Mumbai in order to \nreceive his passport and airline ticket to the United States.  Talabathulla arrived shortly before \nhis plane was scheduled to depart for the Unit ed States.  During this m eeting, Dewan required \nthat Talabathulla pay the rem aining recruitm ent f ees in  order  to re ceive his passport.   \nTalabathulla felt that he had  no choice but to follow Dewanโs  directions.  After receiving \nTalabathullaโs paym ent, Dewan gave Talabath ulla h is pa ssport a s well as an  Off er of \nEmployment letter from Signal that was in English and had not b een translated.  Dewan refused \n- 67 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 68 of 82 PageID #:  894\nto provide a receipt for the payment.   Before leaving for the United States, Dewan continued to  \nassure Talabathulla that he would receive a green card.  \n346.  When Talabathulla arrived in the United States, Signal informed him that it going \nto deduct approxim ately $1,050 pe r month from his  salary for room a nd board.  He was also \ninformed that he would be charged these am ounts regardless of whether he lived  at the Texas \nLabor Camp.   This was the first time Talabathulla had heard that he would be charged for room \nand board.  As described above, the conditio ns at the Texas Labor Ca mp were deplorable.   \nBecause Talabathulla could not afford to pay fo r living expenses twice and repay h is loans, he \nfelt compelled to remain at the Texas Labor Camp.  \n347.  While he was at the Texas Labor Ca mp, Defendants continued to assure \nTalabathulla that he would receive a green card.   \n348.  During the spring of 2007, Talabathulla he  that Signal had threatened to deport \nother Indian workers back to India.  Signal ultim ately transferred Talabathulla to its f acility in \nPascagoula, Mississippi and reduced his wages.  In doing so, however, Signal again reiterated its \npromise that there would be am ple work at the  Mississippi facility, which ultimately turned out \nnot to be true.  As a res ult of the threats of deportation and the debt he had incurred to pay the \nrecruitment fees, Talabathulla felt compelled to remain at Signal, work at its Mississippi facility, \nand accept the lower wages. \n349.  Defendants have never returned any of  the โrecru itment feesโ incurred by  \nTalabathulla and never provided a green card for Talabathulla. \n350.  Talabathulla relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency, long-term \nemployment, and good working c onditions.  He would not have in curred subs tantial debt,  \nrelinquished prior em ployment, or agreed to wo rk for Si gnal in the absence of such false \n- 68 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 69 of 82 PageID #:  895\npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal wou ld attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees, Talabathulla felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \nSammanasunathan Siluvaimuthu \n351.  In or around 2005, while working as a we lder in Abu Dhabi, Samm anasunathan \nSiluvaimuthu (โSiluvaimuthuโ) saw a newspaper advertisement placed by Dewan seeking fitters \nand welders.  The advertisement offered the opportunity to work in the United States and obtain \na green card.   \n352.  Siluvaimuthu spoke with Dewan and  was told to attend an upcom ing \ninformational meeting if he was interes ted in the job opportunity.   During the call, Dewan  \npromised Siluvaimuthu that he would receive a green card as part of the job opportunity.   \n353.  Siluvaimuthu subsequently attended the inform ational m eeting, along \napproximately 100 other Indian workers.  Pol  and Dewan were present at the m eeting and \nexplained the job opportunity.  Am ong other things , they represented that the job opportunity \nwas with Signal and that Signal would obtain permanent residency for the workers in the United \nStates. \n354.  Pol and De wan told Siluvaim uthu and the other workers that they had to pay \nrecruitment fees for the job opportunity totaling  the equivalent of six or seven lakhs.  They \nexplained that the workers could pay the recru itment fees in three installments, if they did not \nhave enough money up front. \n355.  Siluvaimuthu did not believe he had enough money to pay the recruitment fees. \n- 69 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 70 of 82 PageID #:  896\n356.  In or around Nove mber 2006, however, Sil uvaimuthu learned th at some of hi s \nfriends were going to work for Signal through  Dewan Consultants.  Siluvaimuthu had dreamed \nof living in the United States, a nd decided to pursue the job opport unity with Signal.  To that \nend, he met with Sachin Dewan in Chennai for te sting.  After passing the test, Dewan inform ed \nSiluvaimuthu that the recruitment fees had risen to 8.5 lakhs (approximately $19,125). \n357.  Siluvaimuthu was informed that he woul d have to pay 3.5 lakhs (approxim ately \n$7,875) up front.  Siluvaim uthu paid the initial  3.5 lakhs by dem and draft.  To do s o, \nSiluvaimuthu borrowed m oney from friends at an  interest rate of 5 percent per m onth.  \nSiluvaimuthu received a loan for  the remainder of the 8.5 lakhs.   As collateral for th e loan, \nSiluvaimuthu pledged his house and his wifeโs jewelry. \n358.  Subsequently, Siluvaimuthu met with Dewan to pay the remaining recruiting fees.  \nDuring that meeting, Dewan represented to Siluva imuthu that he would r eceive a green card in \napproximately 6 months and then could bring his family to join him in the United States.  Dewan \nfurther represented that the em ployment with  Signal would be long-term  and the living \nconditions would be comfortable, safe, and sanitary. \n359.  On or around November 24, 2006, Siluvaimuthu received a visa from the United \nStates Consulate in Chennai.  Following Siluvaimuthuโs interview at the Consulate, Dewan kept \nSiluvaimuthuโs passport. \n360.  Shortly before he was  to le ave for the United States, Siluvaim uthu attended a \nmeeting at Dewanโs office, durin g which he was forced to sign form s in English without a \ntranslation.  Siluvaimuthu felt compelled to sign the forms because his plane to the United States \nwas leaving shortly, he had paid the recruitment fees to Dewan, and Dewan still had his passport.  \n- 70 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 71 of 82 PageID #:  897\nDewan only returned Siluvaimuthuโ s passport immediately before he  boarded the f light to the \nUnited States. \n361.  When Siluvaimuthu arrived at the Texas Labor Ca mp, he was horrified by the \nconditions.  Signal subsequently inform ed hi m, for the first tim e, that it would deduct \napproximately $1,050 per m onth from his wages for  room and board, regardless of whether he \nlived at the Texas Labor Camp.  Despite the conditions, Siluvaimuthu felt compelled to remain at \nthe Texas Labor Camp and continue working because he could not afford to pay twice for room \nand board and also repay the debt he had incurred in India. \n362.  Defendants have never returned any of  the โrecru itment feesโ incurred by  \nSiluvaimuthu and never provided a green card for Siluvaimuthu. \n363.  Siluvaimuthu relied upon Defendantsโ pr omises of perm anent residency, long-\nterm employment, and good working condition s.  He would not have incurred sub stantial debt, \nrelinquished prior em ployment, or agreed to wo rk for Si gnal in the absence of such false \npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal wou ld attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees, Siluvaimuthu felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled \nto continue working for Signal. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nTHE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION ACT OF 2003 \nForced Labor (18 U.S.C. ยง 1589) (Trafficking with Respect to Peonage, Slavery, Involuntary \nServitude, or Forced Labor) (18 U.S.C. ยง 1590) \nAll Defendants \n364.

This is a human trafficking case brought by Indian workers who were trafficked \ninto the United States through the governmentโs H-2B guest worker program.  Plaintiffs were \ntrafficked to the state of Texas in order to provide labor and services to Signal International, Inc., \nSignal International, LLC, Signal International Texas, G.P., and Signal International Texas, L.P. \n(collectively, โSignalโ).  In an effort to procure a cheap, compliant and expendable labor source, \nDefendants targeted Indian workers, recruiting Plaintiffs for positions as pipefitters and welders \n \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 2 of 82 PageID #:  828\nwith Signal using false promises of assistance in applying for and obtaining permanent residence \nin the United States.  Defendants then bilked Plaintiffs out of tens of thousands of dollars in \nโrecruitment feesโ (for which Plaintiffs assumed massive debt), trafficked them into the United \nStates, forced them to live in squalid conditions in a gated, guarded, isolated labor camp, and \nrequired them to pay exorbitant sums for the โprivilegeโ of living in these repulsive conditions.  \nIf Plaintiffs complained, they were threatened with adverse immigration and employment action \nand the resulting prospect of financial ruin.  Defendants did not treat non-Indian workers in the \nsame manner. \n2.  Plaintiffs are all former employees of Signalโs Orange, Texas facility.  Plaintiffs \nbring this action to recover for the unlawful and fraudulent conduct of Signal and its agents: \nMalvern C. Burnett; the Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C.; Gulf Coast Immigration \nLaw  Center,  LLC;  Sachin  Dewan;  Dewan  Consultant  Pvt.  Ltd.;  Michael  Pol;  and  Global \nResources, Inc. (the โAgentsโ).1 \n3.  Signal is a Gulf Coast-based marine and fabrication company.  Faced with a labor \nshortage and significant volume of work in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Signal sought to \nrecruit  several  hundred  Indian  workers  for  positions  as  welders  and  pipefitters  in  Signalโs \nfacilities in Orange, Texas and Pascagoula, Mississippi. \n4.  Signal retained the Agents to assist in the recruitment process.  Specifically, \nSignal retained Michael Pol and his company Global Resources, Inc. (collectively referred to as \n                                              \n1   On June 13, 2013, Michael Pol filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the United States \nBankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Mississippi (Case No. 13-51168-KMG).  Due to \nthe automatic bankruptcy stay, Michael Pol has not been included as a defendant in this action. \n- 2 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 3 of 82 PageID #:  829\nโPolโ unless a distinction is drawn), a labor recruitment firm based in Mississippi; attorney \nMalvern C. Burnett and his law firms, the Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett and Gulf Coast \nImmigration Law Center, LLC (collectively referred to as โBurnettโ unless a distinction is \ndrawn); and Sachin Dewan and his company, Dewan Consultants Pvt. Ltd. (collectively referred \nto as โDewanโ unless a distinction is drawn), a labor recruitment firm in India.  Signal also \nexecuted a power of attorney authorizing Dewan Consultants to recruit for Signal abroad. \n5.  To minimize cost to Signal, Defendants and Pol designed a scheme in which the \nworkers would pay for their own recruitment, immigration processing, and travel, which was \nmemorialized in the April 18, 2006 Skilled Worker Agreement between Signal and Global.  \nUnder this scheme, any expenses and fees not paid up front by the workers would be paid by \nGlobal.  Global, in turn, would deduct amounts from the workersโ wages in order to recoup those \nexpenses and fees directly from the workers.  Signal, however, would pay nothing. \n6.  By  at  least  mid-2006,  the  Agents  and,  upon  information  and  belief, \nrepresentatives of Signal began traveling to India to recruit workers, including Plaintiffs.  In \nnewspaper advertisements and in-person meetings, Defendants and Pol promised to provide \nstable employment and assist Plaintiffs and other workers in applying for and obtaining a green \ncard for permanent residence in the United States.  In exchange, Plaintiffs and other workers \nwere required to pay for โrecruitment feesโ to the Agentsโranging anywhere from $10,000 to \n$25,000.  Defendants and Pol further represented that Plaintiffsโ families would be able to join \nthem in the United States.   \n7.  To alleviate any concerns about the potential living conditions in the United \nStates, Defendants and Pol represented during in-person meetings that the living conditions \nwould be comparable to those some of the Plaintiffs described experiencing in Singapore and \n- 3 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 4 of 82 PageID #:  830\nDubaiโwhich  included,  for  example,  a  shared  two-bedroom  apartment,  quality  food, \ntransportation to and from the job site, and one trip back to India per year. \n8.  Because  Signalโs  need  for  workers  was  immediate,  Defendants  and  Pol  told \nPlaintiffs they would first acquire temporary work visas (H-2B) because the visas could be \nobtained faster than green cards, but that Defendants would also apply for green cards on \nPlaintiffsโ behalf. \n9.  Lured by Defendantsโ fraudulent promises of legal and permanent work-based \nimmigration to the United States for themselves and their families, Plaintiffs paid the exorbitant \nrecruiting fees to take advantage of the seemingly promising opportunities, causing themselves \nand their families to incur massive debt.  Indeed, to cover the recruiting and immigration fees \nPlaintiffs often had to sell family assets, take out loans secured by real property and jewelry, \nborrow  money  with  high  interest  rates,  and  otherwise  incur  life-altering  debt.    Plaintiffs \nundertook such debt and paid the recruiting and immigration fees in reasonable reliance on \nDefendantsโ promises.  In further reliance on Defendantsโ promises, some Plaintiffs relinquished \nstable employment opportunities in Singapore and elsewhere. \n10.  Defendants, however, had no intention of making good on their promises to assist \nPlaintiffs in applying for and obtaining permanent residency.  To be sure, Defendants did not \ntakeโindeed, had no intention of takingโsteps to assist Plaintiffs in applying for or obtaining \npermanent residency.  In fact, at the suggestion of its Agents, Signal represented to the United \nStates  government  that  it  was  employing  the  Indian  workers  (including  Plaintiffs)  only \ntemporarily and that they would be returned to India โwithin the . . . year.โ  Moreover, internal \ncorrespondence among Signal management from May 2006 reflects that โ[a]ll [Signal is] doing \nnow is bringing the workers in under the H2B program.โ  Defendants brought Plaintiffs to the \n- 4 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 5 of 82 PageID #:  831\nUnited States through the temporary H-2B guestworker visa program despite knowing, and \nfailing to disclose, that the guestworker program was fundamentally incompatible with filing for \ngreen cards. \n11.  Defendants  never  informed  Plaintiffs  that  they  had  no  intention  of  assisting \nPlaintiffs in applying for or obtaining green cards.  Nor did Defendants ever disclose to Plaintiffs \nthe representations they made to the United States government regarding the temporary nature of \ntheir employment and residence.  Plaintiffs were simply unaware that Defendantsโ promises \nregarding employment and permanent residency were false and relied on the false promises to \ntheir detriment. \n12.  Upon arrival in the United States, Signal required Plaintiffs to live in an isolated, \nIndian-only labor camp located outside of Orange, Texas (the โTexas Labor Campโ).  Contrary \nto Defendantsโ representations regarding living conditions, the conditions at the Texas Labor \nCamp were horrid.  Plaintiffs were forced to live in cramped trailersโcontaining up to 24 menโ\nwith little to no privacy.  The trailers were so crowded some Plaintiffs had to sleep on their \nluggage.  The trailers had insufficient bathroom facilities (one or two toilets) that were rarely \ncleaned, which created not only an awful smell but also unsanitary living conditions.  Food was \navailable only at certain hours and was often rotten.  As a result of the conditions, several of the \nresidents became sick.  The camp was also fenced, gated, and guarded, such that Plaintiffs felt \nthey were being imprisoned.   \n13.  As with the โrecruitment fees,โ the cost to live at the Texas Labor Camp was \nborne by Plaintiffs.  Indeed, Signal charged Plaintiffs mightily for the โrightโ to endure the \nhorrible conditions at the campโdeducting $35 per day seven days a week ($1,050 per month) \nout of the Plaintiffsโ pre-tax earnings.  If workers asked to live off-site, Signal informed them \n- 5 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 6 of 82 PageID #:  832\nthat it would still deduct $1,050 per month from their income, effectively prohibiting workers \nfrom seeking more humane and sanitary conditions. \n14.  Significantly, non-Indian workers were not placed in guarded labor camps, were \nnot subjected to squalid living conditions, and did not have exorbitant room and board fees \ndeducted from their pre-tax earnings. \n15.  The Indian workers at the Texas Labor Camp, including Plaintiffs, were also \nsubjected  to  different,  less  favorable  employment  conditions  than  non-Indians.    Upon \ninformation and belief, Indian workers were assigned projects that were more difficult and more \ndangerous  than  those  assigned  to  non-Indian  workers,  received  terms  and  conditions  of \nemployment that were different from and less favorable than non-Indian employees, and were \nsubjected to offensive anti-Indian diatribe and repeated threats of deportation. \n16.  To  prevent  the  Indian  workers  from  complaining,  Defendants  deceived  them \nregarding  their  immigration  status,  threatened  them  with  loss  of  immigration  status  and \ndeportation, and generally perpetrated a campaign of psychological coercion and fraud designed \nto render Indian workers compliant, intimidated, and unable to leave Signalโs employ.  As an \nadditional element of control, Signal required Plaintiffs and other Indian workers to set up direct \ndeposit bank accounts to which Signal maintained access.  These accounts effectively permitted \nSignal to control workersโ ability to leave the facility by threatening to cut off access to the \naccounts.  Upon information and belief, Signal did exactly that to an Indian worker who had fled \nthe Pascagoula, Mississippi facility.   \n17.  Faced with crushing debt and fearful of the possibility of deportation by Signal \nshould  they  complain,  Plaintiffs  felt  compelled  to  continue  working  for  Signal  despite  the \n- 6 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 7 of 82 PageID #:  833\ndreadful conditions at the Texas Labor Camp, the extortionate room and board fees, and the \ndiscriminatory employment conditions.  Simply put, Plaintiffs felt that they had no other option. \n18.  The compulsion Plaintiffs felt to continue working at Signal only increased when \nthey learned about the events that transpired at the Pascagoula, Mississippi facility on March 9, \n2007.  Upset that workers were complaining about conditions at the facility, Signal decided to \nterminate and forcibly send five of the more vocal Indian workers back to India.  Signal locked \nthe gate at the Pascagoula facility, preventing workers from leaving, rounded up and detained the \nvocal workers, and informed them that they were being deported.  One of these workers was so \ndistraught over the threat of returning to India without paying the debt he incurred over the \nrecruitment  fees  that  he  attempted  to  commit  suicide.    When  news  of  the  events  and  the \nattempted suicide traveled to the Texas Labor Camp, Plaintiffs became even more afraid to \ncomplain about the conditions they had been subject to.  Understandably, Plaintiffs feared that \nthey would be returned to India and/or physically harmed if they did so. \n19.  Ultimately, less than a year-and-a-half after coming to the Texas Labor Camp, \nPlaintiffs  were  either  terminated  or  told  they  were  being  sent  to  work  at  the  Pascagoula, \nMississippi facility for lower wages.  Faced with the latter prospect, some Plaintiffs escaped and \nfled the Texas Labor Camp. \n20.  At no point did Defendants apply for or assist Plaintiffs in obtaining permanent \nresidency for themselves or their families.  At no point did Defendants refund the tens of \nthousands  of  dollars  in  recruitment  and  immigration  fees  Plaintiffs  paid  in  reliance  on \nDefendantsโ false promises.  And at no point did Defendants compensate or offer to compensate \nPlaintiffs for the conditions they were forced to endure at the Texas Labor Camp.  Indeed, at no \npoint did they even offer an apology.  Instead, Defendants maintain that how they treated \n- 7 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 8 of 82 PageID #:  834\nPlaintiffs and the other Indian workers was both lawful and moral.  This mistaken viewpoint was \nmost recently espoused by Signalโs CEO in a press release, brazenly declaring that Signal \nโtreated [the Indian workers] with dignity and respect just as we treat each and every Signal \nemployee.โ \n21.  Signalโs  self-delusion  aside,  Plaintiffs  were  victims  of  reprehensible  conduct.  \nPlaintiffs assert claims arising from violations of their rights under the Victims of Trafficking \nand Violence Protection Act (โTVPAโ), the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. ยง 1981), the Ku \nKlux Klan Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. ยง 1985), and claims for damages arising from fraud, negligent \nmisrepresentation, and breach of contract. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n22.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 (federal \nquestion jurisdiction), 18 U.S.C. ยง 1595(a) (civil trafficking), and 28 U.S.C. ยง 1343 (civil rights). \n23.  This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over causes of action based on state law \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(a), as the state law claims arise out of the same nucleus of facts \nthat support the federal claims. \n24.  Additionally, this Court has personal jurisdiction over Signal entities pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 4(k) and Texas Code ยง 17.042, because they are registered to do business in \nTexas, maintain a continuing business presence in the state, operated the Orange, Texas facility \nand Texas Labor Camp where the Plaintiffs worked and resided and where Signal engaged in \nwrongful conduct, and a substantial portion of the communications, transactions, events, or \nomissions underlying Plaintiffsโ claims occurred either in Texas or to secure labor for Signalโs \nOrange, Texas facility.   \n- 8 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 9 of 82 PageID #:  835\n25.  This Court also has personal jurisdiction over the other Defendants under Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 4(h) and Texas Code ยง 17.042, because they recruited Plaintiffs for employment at \nSignalโs Orange, Texas facility, had substantial business contacts with Texas, and a substantial \nportion of the communications, transactions, events, or omissions underlying Plaintiffsโ claims \neither occurred in Texas or occurred to secure labor for Signalโs Orange, Texas facility. \n26.  Venue is appropriate in the Eastern District of Texas under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391 as \nDefendants  engaged  in  human  trafficking,  violations  of  Plaintiffsโ  civil  rights,  fraud, \nmisrepresentation and breach of contract in this judicial district. \nPARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n27.  Plaintiffs are from India and are of Indian alienage, race and ethnicity.   The \nPlaintiffs were all recruited by Defendants in or about 2006 to work at Signalโs Texas Labor \nCamp.  Each of the Plaintiffs paid between $15,000 - $25,000 in โrecruitment feesโ to the Agents \nin the belief that Defendants would assist them in obtaining green cards for Plaintiffs and their \nfamilies. \n28.  Plaintiff Satheesh Kannan Marimuthu was recruited by Defendants beginning in \nor around December 2006 as a fitter.  He arrived in the United States on or around February 15, \n2007. \n29.  Plaintiff Balamurugan Marimuthu was recruited by Defendants beginning in or \naround August 2006 as a fitter.  He arrived in the United States on or around December 13, 2006. \n30.  Plaintiff Muruganandam Arumugam was recruited by Defendants beginning in or \naround May 2006 as a welder.  He arrived in the United States on or around February 1, 2007. \n- 9 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 10 of 82 PageID #:  836\n31.

He performed legal work associated with the \nPlaintiffsโ employment in Orange, Texas, helped to recruit Plaintiffs, filed for visas on Plaintiffsโ \nbehalf, and collected legal fees from Plaintiffs.  At all relevant times, Burnett had an attorney-\nclient relationship with Plaintiffs, including both before and after Plaintiffs arrived in Texas.  In \n- 12 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 13 of 82 PageID #:  839\naddition, at all relevant times, Burnett had attorney-client and business relationships with other \nDefendants. \n52.  Defendant Law Offices of Malvern C. Burnett, A.P.C. (โBurnett Law Officesโ) is \na professional law corporation organized under Louisiana law. Upon information and belief, \nMalvern C. Burnett is the registered agent, sole member and/or corporate officer of Burnett Law \nOffices. \n53.  Defendant Gulf Coast Immigration Law Center, LLC (โGulf Coast Immigrationโ) \nis a Louisiana limited liability corporation.  Upon information and belief, Malvern C. Burnett is \nthe registered agent, sole member and/or corporate officer of Gulf Coast Immigration.   \n54.  Upon information and belief, Defendants Burnett, Burnett Law Offices, and Gulf \nCoast Immigration constituted a joint venture and/or were alter egos of each other in that all \nentities have the same corporate mailing address, intermingle business assets, do not operate at \narmsโ length, and Burnett is the registered agent and sole member and/or corporate officer for \nBurnett Law Offices and Gulf Coast Immigration. \n55.  At  all  relevant  times,  Burnett,  Dewan,  and  Pol  acted  as  agents  and/or \nrepresentatives of Signal.  Burnett, Dewan, and Pol were acting within the course and scope of \ntheir agency at all relevant times and Signal had full knowledge of their acts and consented, \npermitted, authorized and ratified, expressly and/or impliedly, the acts performed by Burnett, \nDewan and Pol as alleged in this complaint. \n56.  At all relevant times, the Defendants were engaged in a joint venture with each \nother to recruit Plaintiffs, along with other Indian workers, to work for Signal at the Orange, \nTexas facility. The Defendants entered into various written and oral agreements evidencing their \nagreement to accomplish such recruitment and each Defendant acted within the course and scope \n- 13 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 14 of 82 PageID #:  840\nof the venture and those agreements.  Defendants each had full knowledge of the actions of the \nother Defendants set forth in this Complaint and consented, permitted, authorized and ratified, \neither expressly or impliedly the actions of the other Defendants. \nSPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS \nSignal Arranged for Dewan, Burnett, and Pol to Bring Temporary Workers  \nto the United States \n57.  The destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina presented Signal with the potential \nto take on lucrative new work fixing damaged oil rigs, ships, and other machine platforms.  As a \nresult of the hurricane, however, some of Signalโs workforce had left the Gulf Coast area, and \nSignal was in need of additional laborersโparticularly skilled fitters and welders. \n58.  In early 2006, Pol approached Signal about providing additional workers for their \noperations.  He informed them that he could provide skilled fitters and welders from India to \nwork for Signal at no cost to Signal.  \n59.  Pol explained to Signal that he would work with Burnett and Dewan to recruit the \nworkers and obtain the appropriate immigration status for such workers, but that the workers, \nincluding Plaintiffs, would pay for all costs and fees associated with the recruitment process, \nimmigration  processing,  and  travel  to  the  United  States.    Signal  would  pay  the  workers, \nincluding Plaintiffs, between $14 - $18/hour, depending on each workerโs skill level. \n60.  Signal  and  Global  executed  a  Skilled  Worker  Recruitment  Agreement  (the \nโRecruitment Agreementโ) on or about April 18, 2006, which set forth certain terms for Michael \nPol and Global to recruit foreign skilled workers for employment at Signal โunder the โH-2Bโ \ntemporary program and/or the โpermanent residenceโ process.โ  The Recruitment Agreement \nrequired Global to be responsible for delivering the workers โat no cost to Signalโ, including \npaying for all costs associated with recruitment, transportation, and entry into the United States \n- 14 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 15 of 82 PageID #:  841\nby the foreign workers.  The costs incurred by Pol and Global were to be paid by the foreign \nworkers, including Plaintiffs. \n61.  Dewan and Signal entered into a power of attorney on or about June 19, 2006, \nwhich permitted Dewan to act as Signalโs โrepresentative in India to facilitate the recruitment of \nskilled workers to the United States of Americaโ for employment with Signal.  This power of \nattorney authorized Dewan to advertise, conduct seminars, conduct skills tests and sign necessary \nlegal documentation related to the recruitment of skilled workers to work in the United States for \nSignal.  \n62.  In  approximately  mid-  to  late-2006,  Signal  entered  into  an  attorney-client \nrelationship with Burnett with respect to legal issues related to Signalโs need for foreign workers.  \nUpon information and belief, Signal and Burnett entered into a written retainer agreement.  \nUnder the retainer agreement, however, Signal would not be responsible for any legal fees owed \nto Burnett, but instead Burnett would receive compensation out of the โrecruitment feesโ paid by \nthe foreign workers, including Plaintiffs. \nThe Agents Recruited Plaintiffs and Other Indian Workers for Signal \n63.  Upon information and belief, Defendants targeted Plaintiffs for recruitment based \non their race and/or national origin.  Specifically, Defendants targeted Indian workers on the \nbelief that the Indian workers would provide a source of cheap, compliant and potentially \nexpendable labor.  The goal of this scheme was to maximize benefits to the Defendantsโ\nincluding the fees received by the Agentsโat the expense of the Indian workers.   \n64.  Acting as Signalโs recruiting agents for the purposes of facilitating the recruitment \nof  Indian  workers  for  employment  at  Signal,  Pol  and  Dewan  placed  advertisements  in \nnewspapers throughout India and the United Arab Emirates in the spring, summer, and fall of \n2006 offering opportunities for welders and fitters to immigrate permanently to the United States \n- 15 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 16 of 82 PageID #:  842\nunder the auspices of Signal, a purported leading marine and fabrication company in Mississippi \nand Texas.  Defendants targeted only Indian workers in their recruitment effortsโindeed, even \nthe  advertisements  used  in  the  United  Arab  Emirates  were  placed  in  Indian-language \nnewspapers. \n65.  Among  other  things,  the  advertisements  and  recruiting  efforts  promised \nโpermanent lifetime settlement in USA for self and families,โ โpermanent residencyโ in the \nUnited States, and/or โgreen cards.โ  Upon information and belief, Pol and Dewan undertook \nthese advertisements and other recruiting efforts on behalf of, at the direction of, and/or in \ncoordination with Signal and Burnett.  \n66.  Signal authorized Pol, Dewan, and Burnett to act as their agents for the purposes \nof recruiting and providing Indian welders and fitters to fill anticipated H-2B guest worker jobs \nat Signalโs Orange, Texas operations. \n67.  Upon information and belief, Signal further authorized Pol, Dewan, and Burnett \nto  represent  that  Signal  would  agree  to  sponsor  bona  fide  green  card  applications  for  the \nPlaintiffs and obtain at least two H-2B visa extensions on behalf of Plaintiffs to allow them to \nremain in the United States working for Signal while their green card applications were being \nprocessed. \n68.  Upon information and belief, Signal authorized these representations even though \nit knew or had reason to know that such visa extensions and green card applications would not be \nbona fide, valid, or lawful under United States immigration law and even though Signal did not \nhave the intention at that time to apply for visa extensions and/or green cards on behalf of all the \nIndian workers, including the Plaintiffs. \n- 16 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 17 of 82 PageID #:  843\n69.  At the latest, Signal learned from the first Indian workers to arrive at Signalโs \nfacilities in Texas and Mississippiโworkers who arrived well in advance of Plaintiffsโthat \nthose workers had paid exorbitant recruitment fees to the Agents, and had made those payments \non the basis of promises of assistance in applying for and obtaining green cards which Signal \nknew was false.  Signal nonetheless continued to facilitate the transportation of hundreds more \nIndian workers to Signal worksites in Texas and Mississippi, including Plaintiffs, because it was \nin Signalโs financial interest to do so. \nPlaintiffs Incurred Substantial Debt to Pay the Agentsโ โRecruitment Feesโ \n70.  In  response  to  the  advertisements  posted  by  Pol  and  Dewan,  Plaintiffs \ncommunicated with Pol and Dewan in the spring, summer, and fall of 2006 via telephone, and \nattended in-person meetings with Pol, Dewan, and Burnett.  During those meetings, the Agents \ninformed Plaintiffs that the job opportunities that had been advertised were with Signal.  In \naddition, the Agents, acting on Signalโs behalf, informed Plaintiffs of the opportunity to work for \nSignal on H-2B visas which would lead to permanent resident (green card) status. \n71.  Specifically, the Agents promised recruits, including Plaintiffs, that Signal would \nsponsor Plaintiffsโ green card applications and extend their H-2B visas multiple times to enable \nPlaintiffs to work in the United States while their green card applications were pending.  In \nexchange, each Plaintiff would have to pay fees totaling as much as 8 lakh rupees (approximately \n$18,000) in a series of approximately three installments. \n72.  At the time Plaintiffs made their payments, one rupee was worth approximately \n$0.0225, and one lakh (100,000 rupees) was worth approximately $2,250. \n73.  The Agents further informed recruits, including Plaintiffs, that they would be able \nto obtain legal permanent residence for their spouses and children. \n- 17 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 18 of 82 PageID #:  844\n74.  In addition, during the telephone communications, at recruitment meetings, and \nthrough  written  documents,  the  Agents  (including  through  their  employees)  represented  to \nPlaintiffs  that  Defendant  Signal  would  provide  lawful,  stable,  and  ample  employment \nopportunities, that working under an H-2B visa for Signal was not inconsistent with applying for \npermanent immigration status sponsored by Signal, and that Signal would obtain for Plaintiffs \nwork-authorized green cards enabling the Plaintiffs to permanently and legally reside in the \nUnited States with their families. \n75.  In  such  communications  with  Plaintiffs,  the  Agents  further  promised  to  act \ndiligently and do everything necessary to ensure that Plaintiffs obtain green cards within 18-24 \nmonths of initiating the green card process. \n76.  Upon information and belief, employees of Signal attended some of the meetings \nand testing sessions with potential workers in India.  Further, upon information and belief, prior \nto the meetings and testing sessions Signal and the Agents conferred regarding the logistics and \nsubstantive content of the meetings and testing sessions. \n77.  In  reasonable  reliance  on  the  Agentโs  promises  regarding  green  cards  and \nemployment opportunities in the United States, Plaintiffs undertook considerable personal and \nfamilial  sacrifices,  including  the  mortgaging  and/or  sale  of  personal  property  and  other \nincurrence of debt, in order to amass the funds necessary to initiate the green card process with \nDefendant  Signal.    For  example,  Plaintiff  Satheesh  Kannan  Marimuthu,  Balamurugan \nMarimuthu, and Rajendran Sappani sold their wivesโ jewelry and/or mortgaged their familiesโ \nhomes  to  cover  the  recruitment  fees.    In  addition,  several  Plaintiffs  relinquished  stable \nemployment in reliance on the Agentโs representations. \n- 18 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 19 of 82 PageID #:  845\n78.  Reasonably relying on these and other promises made to them regarding green \ncards and work opportunities in the United States, Plaintiffs signed green card contracts with the \nAgents at various points from mid-2006 to early 2007 and paid the exorbitant recruiting fees \nrequired by the contracts. \n79.  These contracts and other documents provided by the Agents promised that (1) \nPlaintiffs would work under a โpermanent resident (green card) program,โ and (2) Plaintiffs \nwould promptly receive a refund of all or nearly all of their payments if Defendants did not \nsucceed in securing green cards for Plaintiffs. \n80.  The Agents knew or should have known, however, that they would not refund \nPlaintiffsโ money as promised in the contracts and other documents. \n81.  The Agents induced Plaintiffs to enter into the green card contracts without intent \nto diligently pursue Plaintiffsโ applications and without any basis whatsoever for representing \nthat Signal had lawful long-term employment opportunities to provide Plaintiffs; that Signal \ncould legally apply for numerous H-2B visa extensions to maintain Plaintiffsโ presence in the \nUnited States; that working under an H-2B visa for Signal was not inconsistent with applying for \npermanent immigration status sponsored by Signal; that green card applications sponsored by the \nSignal would be valid and bona fide under U.S. immigration law; and that such applications were \nlikely to be successfully completed and approved within the promised timelines. \n82.  Plaintiffs would not have signed the green card contracts or paid the extraordinary \nrecruitment  fees  charged  by  the  Agents  had  they  known  that  Defendantsโ  promises  and \nrepresentations were false and that Defendants had failed to disclose material facts concerning \nthe nature and terms and conditions of the immigration and work opportunities offered. \nDefendants Arranged for H-2B Visas \n- 19 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 20 of 82 PageID #:  846\n83.  On or about July 20, 2006, and August 17, 2006, the United States Department of \nLabor approved Signalโs labor certification applications for 590 H-2B workers for the period of \nOctober 1, 2006 through July 31, 2007. \n84.  In approving these applications, the United States Department of Labor relied on \nthe accuracy of the applicationsโ stated 10-month period of need. \n85.  Upon  information  and  belief,  the  Department  of  Laborโs  internal  guidelines \nprohibit it from granting labor certification applications without relying on the applicationsโ \nstatement of need. \n86.  In  late  August  and  early  September  2006,  the  United  States  Citizenship  and \nImmigration Service (โUSCISโ) approved Signalโs H-2B visa petitions for 590 H-2B workers for \nthe period of October 1, 2006 through July 31, 2007. \n87.  In  approving  these  visa  petitions,  the  USCIS  relied  on  the  accuracy  of  the \npetitionsโ stated 10-month period of labor need and the representation that Signalโs need was \nbased on a one-time, peak-load, temporary demand.  Indeed, according to regulation, the USCIS \nmust rely on the stated period of the petitionerโs labor need.  See 8 C.F.R. 214.2(h)(6)(ii)(B) \n(2006). \n88.  Defendants knew that the stated period of need in Signalโs applications for labor \ncertifications  and  for  H-2B  visas  were  inconsistent  with  Signalโs  promises  of  permanent \nresidency to Plaintiffs and its actual projected labor need and, therefore, Defendants knew these \nstatements to the government were false. \n89.  The Agents used the H-2B visas, obtained from the federal government on the \nbasis of false statements by Signal and Burnett, to elicit payments from Plaintiffs. \nDefendants Prepared to Bring Plaintiffs and Other Indian Workers \nto the United States \n- 20 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 21 of 82 PageID #:  847\n90.  At various times during the spring, summer, and fall of 2006, Signal employees \nand certain of the Agents traveled to various locations in India and the United Arab Emirates to \ntest Plaintiffsโ welding and pipefitting skills in anticipation of employing Plaintiffs in the United \nStates. \n91.  Plaintiffs paid to travel to the cities where these tests were held. \n92.  Plaintiffs also paid admission fees in order to take these tests. \n93.  Plaintiffs attended and passed these tests, which were overseen and graded by \nSignal and/or Dewanโs agents, employees, and/or representatives. \n94.  Upon information and belief, prior to attending these testing sessions the Agents \nand Signal conferred regarding the logistics and substantive content of the testing sessions. \n95.  After USCIS visa approval, Plaintiffs made necessary preparations to travel to the \nUnited States on H-2B visas to work for Signal, including: paying to obtain necessary travel and \nlegal documents; making payments to the United States Consulate and the Agents for mandatory \nH-2B visa and consular processing fees; attending H-2B visa interviews; and, paying the Agents \nfor travel arrangements. \n96.  In order to secure H-2B visas to work for Signal, Plaintiffs attended interviews \nwith United States consular offices in Indian cities. \n97.  To attend these consular interviews, Plaintiffs had to pay the costs of travel from \ntheir homes and/or current places of employment to various large Indian cities including Chennai \n(Madras) and Mumbai (Bombay). \n98.  The Agents required that Plaintiffs meet with Global, Pol, and/or Burnett in these \ncities before attending their consular interviews. \n- 21 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 22 of 82 PageID #:  848\n99.  Upon information and belief, prior to these meetings, the Agents conferred among \nthemselves and with Signal regarding the topics to be discussed and instructions to be given to \nPlaintiffs at these meetings. \n100.  At the pre-interview meetings, the Agents ensured that Plaintiffs were up-to-date \non paying the recruitment fee installments required by their green card contracts. \n101.  Defendants further required that Plaintiffs pay an additional fee of 35,000 to \n45,000 rupees ($787 to $1,012) for H-2B visa processing. \n102.  The Agents required Plaintiffs to sign documents permitting Dewan to receive \ntheir visa-stamped passports from the consular offices on Plaintiffsโ behalf. \n103.  The Agents also coached Plaintiffs on what to say during consular interviews.   \n104.  The Agents told Plaintiffs that if they did not follow these instructions at their \ninterviews, Plaintiffs would not receive their visas and would forfeit all of the money they had \nalready paid to Defendants, in addition to losing the opportunity to permanently immigrate to the \nUnited States. \n105.  During  Plaintiffsโ  consular  interviews,  the  consular  officials  took  Plaintiffsโ \npassports from them. \n106.  Once Plaintiffsโ visas were approved, consular officials sent the passports, with \nH-2B visas affixed, directly to Dewan. \n107.  After Plaintiffsโ visas were approved, the Agents made travel arrangements for \nPlaintiffsโ departures to the United States. \n108.  Before  Plaintiffs  could  leave  for  the  United  States,  however,  Plaintiffs  were \nrequired to attend final meetings in Dewanโs office.  Such meetings typically took place mere \n- 22 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 23 of 82 PageID #:  849\nhours before Plaintiffsโ scheduled departures to the United States, when Dewanโs office was full \nof other Indian workers anxiously awaiting their departure to the United States.  \n109.  At these meetings, Pol and Dewan collected final installment payments required \nby Plaintiffsโ green card contracts. \n110.  Pol and Dewan also required Plaintiffsโmost of whom do not or did not at the \ntime proficiently read or speak Englishโto sign English-language documents with little or no \ntime for review.  They did not allow Plaintiffs to keep a copy of the documents.  Pol and Dewan \nor their staff demanded that Plaintiffs quickly sign the mandatory documents to avoid missing \nthe flights to the United States and forfeiting the fees Plaintiffs had paid. \n111.  Plaintiffs  had  no  reasonable  opportunity  to  review,  negotiate,  or  make  any \nchanges to the documents presented to them.  Even when Plaintiffs asked Defendants what the \ndocuments said, Defendants refused to interpret or tell Plaintiffs what the documents said. \n112.  Dewan also refused to provide receipts to Plaintiffs who requested evidence of the \namounts paid prior to Plaintiffsโ travel to the United States. \n113.  Pol  and  Dewan  refused  to  return  Plaintiffsโ  passportsโwhich  had  been  in \nDefendant Dewanโs possession since after Plaintiffsโ H-2B visas were approved by consular \nofficialsโuntil Plaintiffs had paid the final installments and signed the mandatory paperwork. \n114.  Without  possession  of  their  passports,  and  within  this  anxious  and  rushed \natmosphere, Plaintiffs had no reasonable opportunity to review, negotiate, and/or make any \nchanges to the documents presented to them. \n115.  On occasions when workers failed to present sufficient funds to pay the final \ninstallment required by the green card contracts, Dewan and his associates threatened to destroy \nand/or deface the workersโ passports.  Such threats were made in the presence of other workers, \n- 23 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 24 of 82 PageID #:  850\ncausing the other workers to reasonably believe that they had no choice but to pay the final \ninstallments in full. \n116.  Because of the Dewan and Polโs coercive behavior during these pre-departure \nmeetings,  and  Plaintiffsโ  extraordinary  and  increasing  levels  of  debt,  Plaintiffs  reasonably \nbelieved that they had no choice but to make the payments required by the Agents and to travel \nto the United States to work for Signal. \n117.  Plaintiffs did not receive their passports from the Agents until Plaintiffs had \nfulfilled all of Defendantsโ requirements. \n118.  At various times from late October 2006 to April 2007, Plaintiffs and other Indian \nworkers traveled from Mumbai to the United States on tickets arranged by Pol and Dewan. \n119.  Signal collected Plaintiffs at the Houston airport upon their arrival and transported \nthem immediately to the Texas Labor Camp. \n120.  Signal sent approximately 300 workers to its Pascagoula, Mississippi facility (the \nโMississippi Labor Campโ), and approximately 290 workers were sent to the Texas Labor Camp \nupon arrival in the United States. \n121.  Plaintiffs  had  no  choice  but  to  use  the  Agents  to  secure  employment  with \nDefendant Signal.  Management personnel at Signal prohibited Indian workers from securing \nemployment at Signalโs operations either through another recruiter or by bypassing recruiters \naltogether and applying directly with Signal. \nMalvern Burnett Purported to Act As Plaintiffsโ Attorney \n122.  At all relevant times, Burnett had an attorney-client relationship with the Indian \nworkers, including Plaintiffs, for purposes of immigration issues and Plaintiffsโ work for Signal. \n123.  Upon  information  and  belief,  the  Indian  workers,  including  each  Plaintiff, \nindividually entered into an Attorney Services Agreement with Burnett.  Those agreements \n- 24 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 25 of 82 PageID #:  851\nprovided the following: (a) Burnett would โrepresent [Plaintiff] as a licensed attorney in the \nUnited  States  of  America  and  file  all  necessary  documents  with  the  government  to  assist \n[Plaintiff] make application for the permanent resident (green card) program;โ (b) Plaintiff would \npay Burnett $3750 for legal services; (c) Burnett would โdo everything within [his] power to \nassist worker to obtain permanent residence status in the United States within 24 months;โ (d) if \nBurnett failed to obtain permanent residence status, Burnett would refund recruitments fees to his \nclients subject to certain exceptions; and (e) either party could โterminate the agreement with 30 \ndays notice given to the other party.โ  Finally, the agreements provided that they โshall be \nconstrued, governed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Maharashtra, India \nand where applicable in the State of Mississippi.โ \n124.  As part of his services, Burnett prepared the immigration forms required for \nPlaintiffs to apply for H-2B status and, thus, to work for Signal in Texas.  In those forms, Burnett \nrepresented to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, under penalty of perjury, that the \nPlaintiffs would stay in the United States only temporarily, returning to India within the year.  At \nthe same time Burnett was submitting those forms, he was telling the Indian workers that they \nwould be eligible for permanent residency, and that he would assist them in applying for green \ncards.  Further, Burnett was aware of the representations Pol and Dewan had made to Indian \nworkers, including Plaintiffs, about receiving green cards in connection with employment at \nSignal.  Burnett also applied for H-2B visas for Plaintiffs despite the fact that H-2B visas are \nincompatible with permanent residency under federal law.  Burnett misled Indian workers by \nconflating the H-2B visa and permanent resident status immigration processes in presentations to \nIndian workers during the recruitment process. \n- 25 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 26 of 82 PageID #:  852\n125.  In addition, Burnett filed with the Texas Workforce Commission completed ETA \n750 forms and attachments seeking permission to import and hire 590 foreign guest workers \n(including  Plaintiffs)  under  8  U.S.C.  ยง 1101(a)15(H)(ii)(b).    In  the  applications  to  Texas, \nBurnett, on behalf of Signal, stated that Signal would employ workers from October 1, 2006 \nthrough July 31, 2007.  Burnett knew that material representationsโincluding those about the \nlength  of  time  the  workers  intended  to  stay  in  the  United  Statesโwere  false.    Burnettโs \nstatements in the applications contradicted Defendantsโ representations that he would assist \nPlaintiffs in obtaining permanent legal residence in the United States. \n126.  Despite acting as Plaintiffsโ attorney, Burnett concealed his true loyalties from \nPlaintiffs by failing to disclose that he had attorney-client and business relationships with Signal \nand other Defendants, and was actively working to promote Defendantsโ interest over those of \nPlaintiffs. \n127.  Specifically, by mid-2006, Burnett had entered into an attorney-client relationship \nwith Signal for the broad purpose of applying for and obtaining lawful status for Indian workers \nto come to the United States.  In 2007, Signal and Burnett entered into a Retainer Agreement \nmemorializing  the  arrangementโnamely,  that  Burnett  would  represent  Signal  at  zero  cost \nbecause the fees for his work were to be paid by the Indian workers, including Plaintiffs.  Burnett \nfailed to disclose his attorney-client relationship or the payment arrangement with Signal to the \nIndian workers, including Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs did not waive any conflict of interest caused by \nBurnettโs relationship with Signal. \n128.  Similarly, Burnett failed to disclose to Plaintiffs his attorney-client relationship \nwith Dewan and Pol, which began no later than mid-2006.  Plaintiffs did not waive any conflicts \nof interest relating to this relationship. \n- 26 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 27 of 82 PageID #:  853\n129.  Burnett also failed to disclose that he had a โMultilateral Business Agreementโ \nwith Dewan and Pol for the broad purpose of recruiting Indian workers to come to the United \nStates.  Plaintiffs did not waive any conflicts of interest relating to this relationship. \n130.  At all relevant times, Burnett preferred Defendants to his Indian clients even \nthough he owed them the same duty of loyalty.   \n131.  For  example,  in  a  clear  violation  of  his  professional  obligations,  Burnett \nforwarded  e-mails  he  received  from  his  Indian  clients  to  third  parties  without  the  clientsโ \npermission. \n132.  Further,  even  though  the  attorney-client  relationship  between  Burnett  and \nPlaintiffs continued after Plaintiffs arrived in Texas, Plaintiffs were not generally allowed to \nspeak or meet with Burnett in Texas.  On one occasion, Signal representatives informed Plaintiff \nSatheesh Kannan Marimuthu that he could not meet with Burnett because it would โviolate \ncompany policy.โ  When Plaintiff Muruganandam Arumugam attempted to speak with Burnett, \nhis calls went unreturned.   \n133.  Upon information and belief, on another occasion, an Indian worker made a call \nto Burnett from the public telephone at the Texas Labor Camp to schedule a meeting.  The \nreceptionist at Burnettโs office told the person that any Signal employees who attended such a \nmeeting would have to pay $100 each to meet with Burnett.   \n134.  Moreover, when questioned by certain Indian workers about the possibility of \nobtaining trafficking visas, Burnett represented to Indian workers that he did not know of anyone \nwho had ever received a trafficking visa, and, thus, that the Indian workers would not be able to \nprocure a trafficking visa.  Upon information and belief, Burnett attempted to dissuade certain \nIndian clients from applying for these visas in order to benefit Signal. \n- 27 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 28 of 82 PageID #:  854\n135.  In contrast to his reluctance to communicate with Plaintiffs and other Indian \nworkers, and in contrast to his failure to provide Plaintiffs accurate information regarding their \nimmigration status, Burnett actively engaged with Defendants and continued to represent Signal \nin connection with the Indian workers.  Upon information and belief, Burnett continued to advise \nSignal on issues regarding the Indian workers and attended meetings with certain of the Indian \nworkers at Signalโs request. \n136.  Burnett displayed a contemptuous attitude toward his Indian clients, which was \ndemonstrated by the multitude of derogatory comments Burnett made about them.  For example, \non  one  occasion,  Burnett  described  his  Indian  clientsโ  communication  style  as  a  โbamboo \nphone.โ   \n137.  On another occasion, when his Indian clients requested original documents rather \nthan copies of those documents, Burnett referred to the clients as โdolts,โ asking, โWhat canโt \nyou make the dolts understand?โ and signing the email as โ[c]onfused and pissed.โ  (David v. \nSignal International, LLC, No. 08-1220, ECF No. 994-9 at 7.) \n138.  Outside of his representation of Plaintiffs, Defendants Pol and Burnett played and \ncompared scores achieved on the video game โBorder Patrol,โ a game hosted on a well-known \nwhite supremacist website where the object is for the player to kill undocumented immigrants, \nincluding children.  (David v. Signal International, LLC, No. 08-1220, ECF No. 994-10 at 26.)   \n139.  Burnett (and the other Defendants) viewed the Indian workers as an exploitable \nsource of fees.  This was poignantly displayed in an email Burnett sent to Dewan and Pol on \nDecember 16, 2006, regarding a Signal worker and client of Burnett.  The worker/client had \nstopped payment on a check to Burnett, and Burnett told Dewan and Pol to ensure that โthe \nidiotโ  restores  the  payment  and  threatened  to  have  the  worker/clientโs  visa  โmysteriouslyโ \n- 28 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 29 of 82 PageID #:  855\nrevoked if he did not pay.  Later in the email, Burnett referred to all the Indian workers, who \nwere his clients, as โthe idiotsโ and speculated about whether he should threaten them with \nโimmediate deportationโ in order to prevent them from stopping payment on future checks.   \n140.  Likewise, Burnett recommended to the Agents that they refuse to provide an \nIndian applicant with a refund despite the fact that his father was dying with cancer, stating \nโ[w]e did the work; we need to get paid.โ  (David v. Signal International, LLC, No. 08-1220, \nECF No. 994-10 at 29.)  \n141.  To be sure, Burnett continued to engage in conduct that was tortious, perpetuate \nDefendantsโ fraudulent scheme, and violate the obligations owed to Plaintiffs after they arrived \nin Texas. \n142.  As discussed above, Burnett continued to have an attorney-client relationship with \nPlaintiffs and other Indian workers, but failed to disclose and obtain waivers for his attorney-\nclient relationship with other Defendants.  Indeed, Burnett actively promoted the interests of \nDefendants over those of Plaintiffs. \n143.  Further, once Plaintiffs were in Texas, Burnett failed to process Plaintiffs for \ngreen cards, failed to disclose that Signal was not going to process them for green cards, failed to \nprovide them with critical information regarding their immigration status, and failed to refund \nany of the fees Plaintiffs paid him. \n144.  Finally, upon information and belief, Burnett participated in meetings with Signal \nand certain Indian workers in Texas during which the Texas workers were threatened with \ndeportation if they engaged in organizing efforts similar to the Indian workers in Mississippi.  \nDuring that meeting, Signal again represented that it would file for green cards on the workersโ \nbehalf. \n- 29 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 30 of 82 PageID #:  856\n145.  Ultimately, Plaintiffs suffered the injury from Burnettโs conduct in Texas. \nSignal Subjected Plaintiffs to Degrading and Discriminatory Conditions at the Texas Labor \nCamp \n146.  Signal assigned Plaintiffs to work at its facility in Orange, Texas, and reside at the \nTexas Labor Camp, a crowded โman campโ consisting of trailer-like bunkhouses surrounded by \nbarbed-wire fences and accessible only by a guarded entrance.  When Plaintiffs Satheesh Kannan \nMarimuthu, Muruganandam Arumugam, and Muralidharan Arumugam first saw the Texas Labor \nCamp, they thought it was a prison. \n147.  Signalโs lack of regard for the Indian workers was demonstrated in internal emails \nthat ridiculed aspects of Indian culture and relayed anti-immigrant sentiments.  For example, \nSignal (a) referred to an Indian worker as a โf*****g Keralite,โ (b) stated that it intended to go \non a โrat huntโ to expose Indian workers who spoke out against Signal, (c) called Indian workers \nโchronic โWhiners,โโ and (d) joked about setting up an arena and taking bets on fights between \nIndian workers.  (David v. Signal International, LLC, No. 08-1220, ECF Nos. 994-15 at 32, 994-\n14 at 37, 994-10 at 75, and 994-15 at 43-44.) \nIsolated Living Conditions \n148.  The  Texas  Labor  Camp  was  located  miles  away  from  shopping,  places  of \nworship, public transportation, or residential communities.  This remote location was chosen \npurposefully by Signal to keep the Plaintiffs and other foreign workers segregated from the rest \nof Orange, Texas.  In fact, Signalโs workers and management went so far as to refer to the Texas \nLabor Camp as a โreservation.โ \n149.  The Texas Labor Camp gates were monitored by security guards retained by \nSignal.  Signalโs security guards required Plaintiffs to show employee identification badges and \n- 30 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 31 of 82 PageID #:  857\nrecorded the time when Plaintiffs entered and exited the Texas Labor Camp.  Signalโs security \nguards also searched Plaintiffsโ packages and bags when they entered the Texas Labor Camp. \n150.  The Indian workers were not permitted to receive visitors in the Texas Labor \nCamp. \n151.  Signal did not require any of its non-Indian employees to live in the segregated \nโman camps.โ \n \n \nOvercrowded and Unsanitary Bunkhouses \n152.  Signal packed up to 24 men into each bunkhouse, in two-tiered bunk beds.  The \nbunkhouse was so congested that it was difficult for workers to move about or even to sit up in \nbed, and any semblance of privacy was impossible. \n153.  Each of the bunkhouses contained workers who worked both day and night shifts, \nso Plaintiffs had difficulty sleeping due to the constant noise and the comings and goings of \nworkers from different shifts. \n154.  The  bunkhouses  contained  insufficient  toilets  and  bathing  facilities.    Each \nbunkhouse contained only one or two toilets, so Plaintiffs had to endure long lines, unsanitary \nconditions, and plumbing problems.   \n155.  These  conditions  failed  to  meet  basic  requirements  of  habitability  and,  not \nsurprisingly, illness and disease were common. \nRotten Food \n- 31 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 32 of 82 PageID #:  858\n156.  Food at the Texas Labor Camp was not readily available.  Plaintiffs had to eat at \nSignalโs mess halls, which were only open during limited hours. If the Indian workers arrived \nlate for a meal, they were often denied food. \n157.  What food the Indian workers received was often rotten and came from kitchens \nthat were not hygienic.  As a result, the Indian workers frequently became ill and sometimes \nrequired  hospitalization.    Plaintiff  Rajendran  Sappani,  for  example,  suffered  from  regular \nstomach ailments as a result of the poor food that required medicine to treat. \n158.  Further,  Signal  refused  to  accommodate  religiously-based  dietary  restrictions.  \nFor example, Plaintiff Moorthy Madhamuni is a vegetarian by religion.  He explained to Signalโs \nrepresentatives the fact that his religion required him to eat vegetarian, but they refused to \nprovide vegetarian food.  Likewise, Plaintiff Murganandam Arumugam was forced to choose \nbetween eating food he was allergic to (lamb and goat), eating food which violated his religious \nbeliefs (beef and pork), or going hungry. \n159.  When Indian workers complained about not having enough clean plates on which \nto eat dinner, Signal responded, โGive them a paper plate that is firm enough to support the curry \nbut flimsy enough to make them have to work at it and bitch.โ \nSignal Charged Plaintiffs $1,050 per Month For These โAccommodationsโ \n160.  For the โprivilegeโ of living in these deplorable conditions, Signal charged the \nIndian workers, including Plaintiffs, $35 per day (approximately $1,050 per month).  Signal \nfailed to inform most or all of the Plaintiffs of these fees during the recruitment process. \n161.  From this amount, $21 was allocated towards rent, and $14 towards food.  The fee \nwas deducted from Plaintiffsโ paychecks automatically with no ability to opt out. \n- 32 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 33 of 82 PageID #:  859\n162.  Upon information and belief, Signal paid Indian workers a lower amount than \nSignal paid its non-Indian workers. \n163.  Some of the Indian workers complained of the disgusting living conditions and \nrequested to move out of the Texas Labor Camp.  Initially, Signal simply refused.  Eventually, \nSignal told workers that if they tried to live outside the Texas Labor Camp, Signal would still \ndeduct the $35 per-day labor camp fees from their wages.  Given their already substantial debts, \nPlaintiffs had no reasonable choice but to continue living in the Texas Labor Camp.  While \nPlaintiffs were forced to pay these exorbitant fees because they had no reasonable financial \nalternative, Signal made over $730,000 in profit from the Mississippi and Texas man camps in \njust one year. \n164.  Upon information and belief, Signal charged Plaintiffsโ room and board in order \nto recoup the cost of building the man camps.  So anxious was Signal to recoup those expenses, \nthat it even charged Plaintiff Muruganandam Arumugam for room and board while he was in the \nhospital recovering from an emergency surgery.  Signal did not require non-Indian workers to \nlive at the Texas Labor Camp or to pay similar room and board expenses. \nContinuous, Abusive, and Discriminatory Supervision \n165.  Plaintiffs felt compelled to remain at the Texas Labor Camp, in part, because \nSignal created an environment of fear through constant, abusive, and discriminatory supervision. \n166.  Signalโs personnel and/or security guards deprived  Plaintiffs  of  any  sense  of \nprivacy  by  conducting  surprise  searches  of  the  bunkhouse,  searching  workerโs  personal \nbelongings, and even occasionally requiring that the Indian workers turn out their pockets.  Upon \ninformation and belief, non-Indian workers were not subject to similar treatment. \n- 33 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 34 of 82 PageID #:  860\n167.  As stated above, Signalโs security guards monitored Plaintiffs and required them \nto show identification whenever they entered and exited the Texas Labor Camp and tracked \nPlaintiffโs movements in and out of the camp.  Upon information and belief, non-Indian workers \nwere not subject to similar treatment. \n168.  Plaintiffs were subjected to โno visitorsโ and โno alcoholโ policies at the Texas \nLabor  Camp.    Violation  subjected  the  workers  to  fines  and  suspension  of  work.    Upon \ninformation and belief, non-Indian workers were not subject to similar policies. \n169.  As stated above, Signal required Plaintiffs and other Indian workers to set up \ndirect deposit bank accounts upon arrival to the Texas Labor Camp, to which Signal maintained \naccess.  Plaintiffs reasonably believed Signal could exert influence over Plaintiffโs financial \narrangements.  Upon information and belief, non-Indian workers were not subject to similar \nrequirements. \n170.  The Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, were often given more difficult and \ndangerous jobs than the other non-Indian Signal workers.  They were required to clean their \nequipment after work hours, while non-Indian workers were permitted to clean their equipment \nduring the last 30 minutes of their shift.  Indian workers were forced to take repeated โskills \ntestsโ  that  non-Indian  workers  were  not  required  to  take.    And  non-Indian  workers  were \npermitted to work more overtime hours than the Indian workers. \n171.  Signalโs  personnel  and  supervisors  frequently  used  offensive  language  while \nspeaking with or referring to Plaintiffs and other Indian workers, including making anti-Indian \ncomments.   \n172.  Signal threatened Plaintiffs and other Indian workers with deportation or adverse \nemployment actions if they did not continue working for Signal, did not work according to \n- 34 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 35 of 82 PageID #:  861\nSignalโs  specifications,  or  complained  about  the  working  and  living  conditions.    Upon \ninformation and belief, workers of non-Indian race, ethnicity, and alienage were not treated this \nway. \nDefendantsโ Continued Misrepresentations, Omissions, and Coercive Conduct \n173.  At meetings with Signal personnel, Indian workers voiced complaints regarding \nthe discriminatory treatment to which they were being subjected.  When Signal did not respond \nto the workers complaints, Indian workers at the Mississippi Labor Camp began meeting to \ndiscuss how to persuade Signal to improve conditions at the camp, and began meeting with third \nparties to discuss how to address their concerns. \n174.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Signal  became  aware  of  these  meetings  and \ncontacted the Agents to express concern about worker organizing efforts.  Upon information and \nbelief, Defendants met and decided on a course of action regarding steps to be taken to quell \nfurther worker organization efforts.  The decided course of action was intended to have a \ndeterrent effect on other Indian workers that might attempt to exercise their rights. \n175.  Consistent with Defendantsโ plan, on March 8, 2007, Signal management met \nwith Indian workers at the Mississippi Labor Camp and informed them that it would fight back \nagainst any โorganizingโ efforts, and that Signal would not extend any of the workersโ H-2B \nvisas if a single worker took legal action against Signal. \n176.  On March 9, 2007, Signalโs agents took five of the more vocal Indian workers at \nthe Mississippi Labor Camp into โcustody,โ fired them, and informed them that they would be \ndeported.  Distraught at what that meant for him and his family, one of the workers attempted to \ncommit suicide.  Demonstrative of Defendantsโ disregard for the Indian workers, in a media \n- 35 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 36 of 82 PageID #:  862\ninterview, Signalโs CEO referred to the suicide attempt as โtheatrics, a bunch of nonsense.โ  \n(David v. Signal International, LLC, No. 08-1220, ECF No. 994-8 at 12.) \n177.  Later that same day, Plaintiffs learned about the events at the Mississippi Labor \nCamp.  Plaintiffs and other Indian workers became frightened by these activities, particularly \nwhen  word  spread  that  Signal  had  imprisoned  Indian  workers  in  Mississippi  who  had \ncomplained about the working conditions and that one worker attempted suicide rather than be \ndeported and face the debts that he had incurred in India in order to come to Signal. \n178.  Plaintiffs reasonably feared that if they tried to leave Signalโs employ or oppose \nthe conditions at the Texas Labor Camp, including by consulting with counsel, Plaintiffs would \nface forced deportation, physical restraint and detention, or other serious harms and/or abuses of \nthe legal process at the hands of Signal. \n179.  In addition, throughout the spring and summer of 2007, Signal representatives \nheld meetings with Plaintiffs and other workers to discuss the status of Plaintiffs and other Indian \nworkersโ visas.  Through its agents, Signal continued to represent that it would arrange for H-2B \nvisa extensions.  At no point during these meetingsโindeed, at no point prior to terminationโ\nwere Plaintiffs informed that they would not be receiving green cards. \n180.  Signal  was,  in  fact,  evaluating  the  workers,  including  Plaintiffs,  and  had  no \nintention of applying for visa extensions for all of the workers or applying for green cards for the \nworkers. \n181.  At  various  times,  Signal  refused  to  confirm  whether  it  had  obtained  visa \nextensions for Plaintiffs.  As a result, Plaintiffs felt further compelled to continue to work for \nSignal and live at the Texas Labor Camp.  Upon information and belief, Signal prevented or \n- 36 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 37 of 82 PageID #:  863\nattempted to prevent Indian workers, including Plaintiffs, from consulting with lawyers about \ntheir situations. \n182.  Despite many promises to do so, Defendants never provided the green cards or \npermanent residency.  In fact, no Defendant ever even applied for a green card for any Plaintiff.  \nAnd, despite contractual provisions that clearly require them to do so, Defendants have failed to \nrefund any of the money Plaintiffs paid to them for green card and visa processing. \nPlaintiffs Relied on Defendantsโ Representations \nSatheesh Kannan Marimuthu \n183.  In or around September 2006, while working as a fitter in Singapore, Satheesh \nKannan  Marimuthu  (โSatheeshโ)  learned  of  an  opportunity  to  work  in  the  United  States.  \nSpecifically, Satheesh saw advertisements in three newspapers, Dinamalar, Dhinathanthi and \nThe Hindu, stating that fitters and welders were needed in the United States.  The advertisements \nfurther stated that applicants would be eligible for a visa and a green card and instructed \ninterested parties to contact Dewan. \n184.  In or around December 2006, Satheesh called Dewan, who confirmed that he was \nassisting in the hiring of fitters and welders for positions in the United States.  During this call \nDewan explained that Satheesh would need to take a test at De Silva Engineering and that if he \npassed, he would get in an interview and that Dewan would begin processing his H-2B visa and \ngreen card.  Dewan also said there would be a service charge of eight lakhs (approximately \n$18,000). \n185.  Satheesh called Dewan twice in January 2007 to confirm that there was a job \nvacancy for him and that he would get a green card.  Satheesh explained that he had a stable \nwell-paying job in Singapore that he was unwilling to relinquish unless he had a job and a green \n- 37 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 38 of 82 PageID #:  864\ncard lined up. Dewan told Satheesh that it was one hundred percent certain that Satheesh would \nreceive a green card and that Satheesh should not pass up the rare opportunity to move to the \nUnited States with his family.  Dewan stated that Pol and Burnett would work to ensure Satheesh \nreceived a green card. \n186.  Only after Dewan promised a green card and the fitter job in the United States did \nSatheesh resign his fitter job in Singapore.  \n187.  In  January  2007,  Satheesh  returned  to  India  to  take  the  test  at  De  Silva \nEngineering.  At this time, Dewan stated that Satheesh needed to pay the eight-lakh service \ncharge and make two demand drafts of $5,000 eachโone payable to Michael Pol and the other \npayable to Malvern Burnett. Dewan stated that the demand drafts were to cover attorneysโ fees \nand that this payment would ensure Satheesh received a green card.   \n188.  After Satheesh passed the test at De Silva Engineering, Dewan and his employee, \nSalimon, informed Satheesh that he also needed to pay $1,000 for visa stamping at the embassy \nand an additional $400 for โmedical feesโ before he could begin working in the United States.  \nSatheesh was instructed to contact Salimon only after he had compiled the necessary funds.  \n189.  To compile the funds demanded by Dewan, Satheesh was forced to pawn family \njewelry, borrow $10,000 at a high interest rate from private lenders, and withdraw his life \nsavings of $4,000. \n190.  After Satheesh notified Salimon that he had funds sufficient to pay the recruiting \nfees, Salimon instructed Satheesh to come to his office in Chennai, India to make the first \npayment of $1,000, which Satheesh did.  Salimon accepted the money on behalf of Dewan and \nagain  confirmed  that  Satheesh  would  receive  a  green  card  in  exchange  for  the  payment.  \nSatheesh requested a receipt for his payment, which Salimon refused to provide.   \n- 38 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 39 of 82 PageID #:  865\n191.  After receiving the payment from Satheesh, Salimon filled out the paperwork \nSalimon stated was necessary for visa processing and notified Satheesh that he was scheduled for \nan interview at the United States Consulate in Chennai about three days later. Salimon called \nSatheesh two days after the interview to inform him that Satheeshโs visa had been approved and \nthat Salimon was holding Satheeshโs passport.   \n192.  Salimon eventually notified Satheesh that his flight to the United States would \nleave from Mumbai on February 15, 2007.  Satheesh was instructed to bring funds for the \nremaining  recruitment  fees  to  Dewanโs  office.    When  he  arrived,  Dewan  took  Satheeshโs \npayment, but again refused to provide receipts.  Only after taking the payment did Dewan return \nSatheeshโs passport. \n193.  Satheesh departed India for the United States on February 15, 2007.  A Signal \nemployee picked Satheesh and others up from the airport in Houston, Texas and brought them \ndirectly to the Texas Labor Camp.  Satheesh thought the labor camp was a prison the first time \nhe saw it.  \n194.  Prior to receiving Satheeshโs payments, Dewan and Salimon represented that \nSatheesh would be living in an apartment with two to three other workers when he arrived in the \nUnited States.  Dewan and Salimon represented that Satheeshโs living conditions in the United \nStates would be as good as, or better than, his living conditions in Singapore.  As discussed \nabove, the living conditions were far from what was promised. \n195.  In addition, Signal supervisors regularly made racial and ridiculing comments \nabout the Indian workers, including Satheesh, and gave the most difficult and dangerous jobs to \nIndian workers.   \n- 39 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 40 of 82 PageID #:  866\n196.  Signal employees further threatened that if Satheesh left the labor camp he would \nbe  fired  and  that  Signal  would  stop  processing  his  immigration  status.    Because  of  these \nstatements, and his debt in India, Satheesh felt trapped, that could leave the Texas Labor Camp, \nand that he could not leave Signalโs employ. \n197.  In March 2007, Signal held a meeting at which Satheesh and other workers were \ntold that they had to stay in the labor camp and that they could only eat the food cooked at the \ncamp.  Signal representatives stated that anyone who did not comply with these rules would lose \ntheir job and be deported. \n198.  In April 2007, Signal held another meeting, during which they notified Satheesh \nand others that only some of the workers would have their visas renewed.  Signal stated that \nthose workers whose visas had not been renewed would be deported.   \n199.  Because Signal and Dewan frequently represented that Michael Pol and Malvern \nBurnett were Satheeshโs lawyers for immigration matters, Satheesh requested to speak with \nand/or meet with Michael Pol and Malvern Burnett.  Signal employees refused, stating that \nSatheeshโs request would violate company policy. \n200.  Defendants  have  never  returned  any  of  the  โrecruitment  feesโ  incurred  by \nSatheesh and never provided a green card for Satheesh or his family. \n201.  Satheesh relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency, long-term \nemployment,  and  good  working  conditions.    He  would  not  have  incurred  substantial  debt, \nrelinquished  prior  employment,  or  agreed  to  work  for  Signal  in  the  absence  of  such  false \npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal would attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \n- 40 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 41 of 82 PageID #:  867\npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees, Satheesh felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \nBalamurugan Marimuthu \n202.  Balagmurgan Marimuthu (โMarimuthuโ) is from Trichy, India.  In or around \nAugust 2006, he saw an advertisement for a job opportunity for welders and fitters in the \nnewspaper Dinamalar. \n203.  Interested in the possibility of additional income, Marimuthu traveled to Chennai, \nIndia to interview for the position.  At the interview, Pol and Dewan told Marimuthu he must pay \n20,000  rupees  (approximately  $450)  as  an  interview  fee  and  for  a  medical  examination.  \nMarimuthu declined to pay the fee. \n204.  Shortly after the interview, however, Marimuthu saw a second advertisement in \nDinamalar.  The advertisement promised employment in the United States and green cards for \nthe workers and their families.  Marimuthu was extremely interested in the possibility of working \nin the United States and receiving green cards for himself and his family. \n205.  The  advertisement  indicated  that  interested  applicants  should  appear  on \nNovember 8, 9, or 10 at De Silva Engineering in Chennai, India for an interview.  Marimuthu \nagain travelled to Chennai and interviewed on November 8, 2006. \n206.  At the interview, Marimuthu learned that the job opportunity was with Signal \nInternational.  Pol, Dewan, Burnett, and representatives from Signal attended this interview \nsession, along with 40 to 50 potential workers. \n207.  During the interview, Pol and Burnett asked Marimuthu about his previous work \nexperience.  Marimuthu explained his prior work experience in Singapore, and described the \naccommodations,  food,  and  benefits  that  were  provided  by  the  employer.  Pol  and  Burnett \n- 41 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 42 of 82 PageID #:  868\npromised that Signal would provide the same type of accommodations, food, and benefits.  \nConsistent with the advertisement, Pol and Burnett also promised that Signal would provide \ngreen cards for Marimuthu, his wife, and his daughter. \n208.  Subsequently, one of Signalโs representatives administered a test to Marimuthu to \ndetermine his capabilities as a fitter, which Marimuthu passed. \n209.  After he passed the test, Dewan and his employee, Salimon, informed Marimuthu \nand the other workers who passed the test that they would enter the United States on an H-2B \nvisa and would be processed for a green card once they arrived in the United States. \n210.  Dewan  then  told  the  workers  that  this  opportunity  would  cost  8  lakhs \n(approximately $18,000) and represented that this fee would be used for processing of the \nworkersโ green cards. \n211.  Dewan told Marimuthu he would have to make an initial deposit of 35,000 rupees \n(approximately $787), and then pay Pol and Burnett $5,373 each by demand draft.  Marimuthu \nunderstood that Burnett was an American lawyer that was assisting him with obtaining his green \ncard, among other things. \n212.  Based  on  the  representations  from  Dewan,  Pol,  and  Burnett,  including  the \nrepresentations about receiving a green card for himself and his family, Marimuthu was willing \nto pay the required recruitment fees.  To that end, on November 14, 2006, Marimuthu paid \napproximately 35,000 rupees he had saved from his work in Singapore. \n213.  Marimuthu knew he would need to interview at the United States Consulate to \nwork for Signal.  He asked Dewan when his interview with the Consulate would be, but he was \ntold he first had to pay an additional two lakhs (approximately $4,500). \n- 42 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 43 of 82 PageID #:  869\n214.  Marimuthu did not have enough money to pay the additional fee and believed it \nwould take him about three years to earn one lakh in India.  As a result, he borrowed money \nfrom his father and a Tamil Nadu society.  As collateral for the latter loan, Marimuthu provided \nhis wifeโs jewelry (despite deep sentimental and cultural value). \n215.  Marimuthu also borrowed four lakhs (approximately $9,000) from his uncle at a \nsignificant monthly interest rate.  As collateral, Marimuthu offered title to his house.  Marimuthu \nonly agreed to these terms because he believed he would be able to pay his uncle back quickly \nonce Marimuthu arrived in the United States. \n216.  Pol and Burnett scheduled Marimuthuโs interview at the Consulate for December \n4, 2006 in Chennai. \n217.  Prior to the interview, on December 3, 2006, Salimon meet with Marimuthu and \ncoached him on what to say during the interview. \n218.  Marimuthu attended the Consulate interview on December 4 and was approved \nfor a visa.  The Consulate informed Marimuthu that his passport would be sent to his home by \ncourier and gave Marimuthu a courier receipt. \n219.  After the interview, Marimuthu met Salimon at a hotel in Chennai.  Salimon took \nMarimuthuโs paperwork, including the courier receipt for the passport.  Salimon told Marimuthu \nhe would keep Marimuthuโs passport, and that he would call when the visa in the passport was \nstamped.  Salimon did not return Marimuthuโs passport after it was stamped with the visa. \n220.  On December 8, 2006, Salimon instructed Marimuthu to take out demand drafts \nfor Pol and Burnett.  Salimon also informed Marimuthu his flight to the United States was \nbooked for December 13, 2006. \n- 43 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 44 of 82 PageID #:  870\n221.  Believing  that  he  would  receive  a  green  card  for  himself  and  his  family, \nMarimuthu obtained two demand drafts payable to Pol and Burnett, each in the amount of \n$5,373.00 (upon information and belief, these demand drafts were required to be paid in United \nStates dollars).  Marimuthu wrote in the memo line of the drafts โgreen card fees.โ   He paid an \nadditional six lakhs (approximately $13,500) to Dewan in cash. \n222.  Two days before leaving for Chennai, Salimon contacted Marimuthu and told him \nhe would need to arrange and pay for his travel from Trichy to Chennai, as well as pay for \nmedical testing.  Marimuthu had not been previously informed that he would be responsible for \nthese  travel  and  medical  fees,  which  totaled  about  15,000  rupees  (approximately  $337).  \nMarimuthu told Salimon he did not believe he should have to pay these fees.  Salimon told \nMarimuthu that if he did not, Signal would cancel his flight to the United States and Marimuthu \nwould forfeit the payments he had already made.  Marimuthu felt threatened, and he worried that \nhe might lose his money and the opportunity to work in the United States on a green card.  As a \nresult, he received a last-minute loan from a distant relative for the additional 15,000 rupees. \n223.  On December 12, 2006, Marimuthu travelled to Chennai.  From there, Salimon \ngave Marimuthu a plane ticket to Mumbai. \n224.  When he arrived at Dewanโs office in Mumbai, Marimuthu attempted to negotiate \nwith Dewan about reducing his recruitment fees, instead of charging the full eight lakhs.  Dewan \nthreatened to cancel Marimuthuโs plane ticket if he did not pay the full amount. \n225.  Fearful that he would forfeit the money he had already paid and the opportunity to \nreceive a green card, Marimuthu made the final payments.  He also paid an additional fee of \n2,500 rupees (approximately $56) for a medical certificate that Signal said he would need to \n- 44 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 45 of 82 PageID #:  871\nenter the United States.  After these payments, Marimuthu was forced to sign several forms, \nwhich were in English, without adequate time to read and understand the forms. \n226.  On December 13, 2006, Marimuthu traveled from Mumbai to Houston, Texas.  \nUpon arriving in Houston, a Signal representative drove Marimuthu to the Texas Labor Camp.  \nAs described above, the conditions at the labor camp were horrid.  Marimuthu was shocked \nbecause he had been promised that the living conditions while working for Signal would be the \nsame as those he described in Singapore. \n227.  Marimuthu felt compelled to remain at the Texas Labor Camp and work for \nSignal because of the debt he had incurred to pay the recruiting fees and because he believed \nthat, if he did so, Signal would obtain a green card for him and his family.   \n228.  Marimuthu also felt compelled to remain at the Texas Labor Camp and work for \nSignal, because Signalโs employees and representatives threatened to deport workers if they did \nnot do their jobs properly or if they tried to leave Signal. \n229.  In September 2007, Signal held a meeting for the workers.  Signal told the \nworkers that they were going to apply for one more H-2B visa extension, but that they would not \nbe receiving the promised green cards.  This was the first time that Signal ever informed \nMarimuthu that it was not providing the promised green cards. \n230.  True to form, neither Signal nor any of the other Defendants ever provided or \napplied for a green card for Marimuthu or his family.  Nor did they ever return any of the \nrecruitment fees incurred by Marimuthu. \n231.  Marimuthu relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency, long-term \nemployment,  and  good  working  conditions.    He  would  not  have  incurred  substantial  debt, \nrelinquished  prior  employment,  or  agreed  to  work  for  Signal  in  the  absence  of  such  false \n- 45 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 46 of 82 PageID #:  872\npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal would attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees, Marimuthu felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \nMuruganandam Arumugam \n232.  In or around May 2006, Muruganandam Arumugam (โMuruganandamโ) learned \nof  advertisements  in  two  newspapers,  Dinathandhi  and  The  Hindu,  stating  that  fitters  and \nwelders were being recruited to work in the United States.  The advertisements instructed \ninterested parties to contact Sachin Dewan and his company Dewan Consultants. \n233.  Muruganandam was working as a welder in Singapore, but he was excited about \nthe opportunity to live and work in the United States.  He contacted Dewan.  Dewan informed \nhim that welding jobs were available in the United States and that Dewan could help him secure \nsuch a position.  Dewan told Muruganandam that he would need to pass a welding test at De \nSilva Institute before he would be considered for any positions. \n234.  Muruganandam  traveled  over  800  kilometers  on  four  separate  occasions  to \nparticipate in the welder recruitment process.  During one of these trips, Muruganandam met \nwith Pol, Burnett and Dewan.  At this meeting, Muruganandam was informed that, if he was \nselected, he would definitely receive a green card after he was hired for the welding job in the \nUnited States.  He was also repeatedly assured that his family would eventually be able to join \nhim in the United States and that his living conditions in the United States would be better than \nin Singapore, where Muruganandam lived in a private apartment with his wife and kids. \n235.  Dewan also told Muruganandam that he would have to pay a service charge of \neight lakhs (approximately $18,000) to Dewan Consultants to secure a green card and the \n- 46 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 47 of 82 PageID #:  873\nwelding job in the United States.  Of this amount, 35,000 rupees was due as a deposit before \nDewan would arrange the necessary interview with the United States Consulate in Chennai. \n236.  After Muruganandam passed his welding tests, he was instructed to wait two to \nthree months for a phone call from Dewan, which would inform him that it was time to interview \nat the U.S. Consulate.  During this time Muruganandam returned to his stable welding job in \nSingapore which paid 750 Singapore dollars per week (approximately $540). \n237.  Eventually, Muruganandam was informed that it was time to return to India to \nparticipate in the Consulate interview.  Muruganandam was instructed to bring the initial deposit \nof 35,000 rupeesโnearly his entire life savingsโto Chennai.  As instructed, Muruganandam \npaid the money to Dewan, Burnett, and Pol. \n238.  After that meeting, Dewanโs employee, Salimon, provided Muruganandam with \npaperwork to bring to the Consulate for the interview he arranged.  During the interview, \nMuruganandam was informed that he could not get a visa through the Consulate in India because \nhe was a permanent resident of Singapore.  Muruganandam relayed this information to Dewan, \nwho informed him that he would need to make an additional deposit of 165,000 rupees ($3,712) \nin order to continue the process.  \n239.  To  compile  the  funds  demanded  by  Dewan,  Muruganandam  had  to  borrow \n165,000 rupees from his mother-in-law.  In late November 2006, Muruganandam paid this \nmoney to Salimon in Chennai.  Salimon provided additional documentation to Muruganandam \nand instructed him to attend an interview at the U.S. Consulate in Singapore, which eventually \ngranted Muruganandam a visa. \n240.  Because Muruganandam could not complete the welding tests, meet with Dewan \nand Signalโs agents, and attend interviews at consulates in India and Singapore while also \n- 47 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 48 of 82 PageID #:  874\nworking a full time job, he was forced to relinquish a stable, well-paying job in Singapore to \npursue the position with Signal.   \n241.  Salimon instructed Muruganandam to gather the remaining 600,000 rupees.  To \ndo so, Muruganandam was forced to borrow the additional funds from his mother-in-law. \n242.  When Muruganandam notified Salimon that he had the 600,000 rupees, Salimon \ninstructed him to get on a plane from Chennai to Mumbai, which was leaving in a matter of \nhours, and to report to Dewanโs office. \n243.  Once in Mumbai, Muruganandam went to Dewanโs office as instructed.  While in \na  small  room,  surrounded  by  several  intimidating  people  who  worked  for  Dewan, \nMuruganandam paid the additional rupees to Dewan.  He also signed various documents written \nin English that he did not understand. \n244.  Only  after  Muruganandam  paid  the  600,000  rupees  did  Dewan  give \nMuruganandamโs passport back to him.  Dewan then provided Muruganandam with a plane \nticket to the United States which was scheduled to leave in a matter of hours. \n245.  Murganandam departed India for the United States on February 1, 2007.  A Signal \nemployee drove Murganandam and others from the airport in Houston, Texas directly to the \nTexas Labor Camp.  The first time he saw it, Murganandam thought the labor camp was a prison. \n246.  Dewan  had  represented  that  Murganandamโs  living  conditions  in  the  United \nStates would be as good as, or better than, his living conditions in Singapore.  As described \nabove, however, the living conditions were reprehensible, and Murganandam was forced to live \nin one of the labor campโs crowded trailers. \n247.  As  Signal  was  using  two  or  three  trailers  in  the  Labor  Camp  for  storage, \nMurganandam and other workers asked if the equipment could be moved to allow the workers to \n- 48 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 49 of 82 PageID #:  875\nspread out and have more sanitary living conditions.  Signal refused to move the equipment and \nlocked the trailer doors to prevent the workers from using the additional bathrooms and beds in \nthe storage trailers.   \n248.  Because Signal often served spoiled food, or ran out of fish or chicken options, \nMurganandam was forced to choose between eating food he was allergic to (lamb and goat), \neating food which violated his religious beliefs (beef and pork), or going hungry. \n249.  Signal  supervisors  also  treated  Indian  workers,  including  Murganandam,  far \nworse than the non-Indian workers.  For instance, the foreman regularly allowed the non-Indian \nworkers to clean their equipment during the final thirty minutes the workers were scheduled to \nwork each day.  Conversely, the Indian workers were required to clean their tools every day after \ntheir shift had ended, which amounted to approximately thirty minutes of unpaid work each day.  \nSimilarly, the foreman allowed the non-Indian workers to work overtime far more frequently \nthan the Indian workers. \n250.  Signal employees threatened that if Murganandam left the labor camp on his own \nhe would be fired and that Signal would stop processing his immigration status.  Based on these \nstatements and his debt in India, Murganandam felt trapped.  He felt that he could leave the \nTexas Labor Camp or Signalโs employ. \n251.  Signal informed Murganandam that he could live outside of the Labor Camp, but \nthat he would still be responsible for paying for the housing and food provided at the Labor \nCamp.  Murganandam was never informed that Signal would charge him for food or housing \nbefore he left India. \n252.  Signal  only  provided  infrequent  meetings  for  employees  to  express  their \ngrievances.  Nevertheless, Murganandam could not attend these meetings because they were \n- 49 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 50 of 82 PageID #:  876\nalways conducted at 5:00 p.m., during Murganandamโs work shift.  Moreover, the meetings were \nineffectual for workers like Murganandam, because they were conducted in English and no \ntranslator was provided. \n253.  When Murganandam and a friend inquired about the status of their visas and \ngreen cards, a Signal representative declined to discuss their status.  When Muruganandam called \nBurnett to discuss the status of his visa and green card, Burnett refused to return his calls. \n254.  Defendants  have  never  returned  any  of  the  โrecruitment  feesโ  incurred  by \nMurganandam and have never provided a green card for Murganandam or his family. \n255.  Murganandam relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency, long-\nterm employment, and good working conditions.  He would not have incurred substantial debt, \nrelinquished  prior  employment,  or  agreed  to  work  for  Signal  in  the  absence  of  such  false \npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal would attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees, Murganandam felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled \nto continue working for Signal. \nMuralidharan Arumugam \n256.  In  or  around  March  2006,  Muralidharan  Arumugam  (โMuralidharanโ)  saw \nadvertisements in two local newspapers for welding and fitting jobs in the United States.  The \nadvertisements indicated that interested parties should contact Dewan Consultants. \n257.  Around  July  2006,  Muralidharan  attended  a  meeting  at  Dewan  Consultants.  \nSachin Dewan ran the meeting with the assistance of Salimon, Pol and Burnett.  During this \nmeeting Muralidharan and the other attendees were advised that Signal had fitting and welding \njobs available in the United States.  The attendees were advised that whoever secured a job \n- 50 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 51 of 82 PageID #:  877\nwould earn $18 per hour for 50 hours of work per week, that food and lodging would be \nprovided, and that each worker would get a green card.  To be considered for these positions, \nMuralidharan  and  the  other  attendees  would  need  to  pass  performance  tests  and  pay \napproximately six lakhs (approximately $13,500). \n258.  Encouraged by the prospect of working in the United States, Muralidharan took \nand passed the requisite tests right after the initial meeting at Dewan Consultants.  \n259.  Sachin Dewan said he would schedule a visa interview for Muralidharan at the \nU.S. Consulate as soon as Muralidharan paid 1.5 lakhs (approximately $3,375). \n260.  In  order  to  meet  Dewanโs  demand,  Muralidharan  mortgaged  his  familyโs \nagricultural land against his fatherโs wishes.  Muralidharan used the money he raised to pay 1.5 \nlakhs to Dewan for his Consulate interview. \n261.  Muralidharan successfully completed his Consulate interview around November \n2006.  Muralidharan promptly notified Dewan that he had passed and that he was ready to \ncontinue with the process. \n262.  In  or  around  December  2006,  Muralidharan  attended  a  second  meeting  with \nDewan Consultants.  During this meeting Muralidharan learned that the cost to work in the \nUnited States had increased to eight lakhs (approximately $18,000), rather than the six lakhs he \nwas originally quoted. \n263.  At the same meeting, Dewan told Muralidharan that he needed to pay a second \ndeposit of $10,746 towards this amount in the form of two $5,373 demand draftsโone payable \nto Pol and the other payable to Burnett.  Dewan represented that these payments would ensure \nthat Muralidharan received a green card, which would enable him to permanently live and work \n- 51 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 52 of 82 PageID #:  878\nin the United States.  After receiving a letter that confirmed he would receive a green card, \nMuralidharan paid the second deposit of $10,476 on December 9, 2006. \n264.  To compile the funds demanded by Dewan, including the second deposit and the \nremaining amounts owed on the eight lakhs, Muralidharan mortgaged his fatherโs house, pawned \nhis wifeโs jewelry and took out private loans. \n265.  As soon as Muralidharan compiled the necessary funds, he traveled to Mumbai \nand paid the remaining portion of the eight lakhs charged by Dewan.  After Muralidharan paid, \nDewan returned his passport and provided him with plane tickets for a flight to the United States \nthat departed the next day. \n266.  Muralidharan departed India for the United States on or about December 11, \n2006.  A Signal employee drove Muralidharan and others from the airport in Houston, Texas \ndirectly to the Texas Labor Camp.  The first time he saw it, Muralidharan thought the camp was \na prison. \n267.  Prior to receiving his first paycheck, Muralidharan was not aware that Signal \nwould deduct money for room and board. \n268.  As described above, the living conditions at the camp were reprehensible.  As a \nresult of over-crowding, unsanitary conditions, and spoiled food, numerous workers, including \nMuralidharan, became ill seriously while living in Signalโs Texas Labor Camp.   \n269.  Muralidharan contracted an intestinal virus or infection while living at Signalโs \nTexas Labor Camp and had to have emergency surgery.  Muralidharan remained bedridden in \nthe hospital for four days following the surgery.  Muralidharan departed from the hospital early \nbecause  he  could  not  afford  to  stay  as  long as  he  was  advised  to  stay.    Mulihandharanโs \nhospitalization resulted in charges exceeding $30,000. \n- 52 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 53 of 82 PageID #:  879\n270.  Nonetheless,  Signal  continued  to  charge  Muralidharan  for  food  and \naccommodations while he was in the hospital, unable to work. \n271.  As a result of the debt he had incurred to pay the recruiting fees and the fees for \nhis hospitalization, as well as the promise of a green card, Muralidharan felt compelled to remain \nat Signal. \n272.  Defendants  have  never  returned  any  of  the  โrecruitment  feesโ  incurred  by \nMuralidharan and have never provided a green card for Muralidharan or his family. \n273.  Muralidharan relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency, long-\nterm employment, and good working conditions.  He would not have incurred substantial debt, \nmortgaged his familyโs land, or agreed to work for Signal in the absence of such false promises.  \nBecause of his fear that Signal would attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment and abuse \nby Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to pay \nDefendantsโ recruiting fees, Muralidharan felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \nSatyanarayana Ellapu \n274.  In or around June 2006, while working as a structural welder in Andhra Pradesh, \nIndia, Satyanarayana Ellapu (โSatyaโ) saw an advertisement in the local newspaper, Eenadu, for \npotential employment in the United States.  The advertisement stated that a โleading marine and \nfabrication company in Mississippi and Texasโ was hiring welders and pipefitters for its facilities \nin the United States and was conducting tests on June 25, 26, and 28, 2006, for the positions. \n275.  The  advertisement  also  stated  that  the  positions  may  include  โpermanent \nemployment visasโ and a โ2 years [sic] contract.โ \n- 53 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 54 of 82 PageID #:  880\n276.  Satya was hopeful that the job opportunity would better enable him to provide for \nhis family, for whom he was the sole breadwinner. \n277.  On June 26, 2006, Satya traveled an hour from his village to a training center to \ntake a test to determine his eligibility for hire at Signal.  Sachin Dewan and other Signal \nrepresentatives were present at this meeting, along with 20 to 30 other welders and pipefitters.  \nSatya passed the test and was instructed to return in three days. \n278.  Three  days  later,  Satya  returned  to  the  training  center  an  attended  an \ninformational  meeting  with  approximately  50  other  workers.    Dewan  and  Burnett  led  the \nmeeting.  Dewan informed the workers that the opportunities were for positions in Signalโs \nfacilities in Mississippi or Texas.  Dewan further informed the workers that they would receive \nan H-2B visa for the first 9 months of their employment with Signal, but that they would then be \nprovided a green card.  Dewan indicated that the process would take four to six months and \nwould cost six lakhs (approximately $13,500), of which one lakh (approximately $2,250) had to \nbe paid up front. \n279.  Satya complained about the cost to Dewan and Burnett.  They informed Satya that \nhe had no choiceโโIf you want the job, you have to pay.โ  However, they also promised that the \nmoney would be โeasily recoveredโ once Satya began working in the United States. \n280.  In response to the workersโ concern about the size of the up-front payment, \nDewan and Burnett stated that the workers could pay 20,000 rupees (approximately $450) within \n20 days and pay the balance later.  If the men paid the 20,000 rupees, they would be guaranteed \nthe job. \n281.  Dewan and Burnett then distributed applications explaining that the worker had to \npay the recruiting fees in installments by demand drafts and cash. \n- 54 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 55 of 82 PageID #:  881\n282.  After the meeting, Satya returned to his village to discuss the opportunity with his \nfamily.  His family did not have enough money cover the recruiting fees, but they nonetheless \nencouraged him to applyโbelieving that a green card would assist Satya in providing for them. \n283.  Because Satyaโs life savings totaled one lakh, he borrowed four and a half lakhs \n(approximately $10,125) from a lender with interest.  As collateral, Satya pledged his fatherโs \nancestral land and his home, which the lender threatened to repossess if Satya missed any \npayments. \n284.  On July 20, 2006, Satya met with an employee of Dewan to make his first \npayment of 20,000 rupees.  The employee gave Satya four forms to sign.  The first form was for \nGlobal and explained the payment schedule and amounts.  The second form was for Burnett and \nexplained the attorneysโ fees for legal services, employment agreements, and labor certifications.  \nThe third form explained Dewanโs services.  The fourth form was an employment agreement \nwith Signal.  Satya signed the four forms, trusting that Dewan had accurately translated them. \n285.  Subsequently, Satya had several meetings with Dewanโs employees in which he \nwas asked to make additional payments, including fees for visa processing, bank drafts, and \ntravel and accommodation in Chennai, where he interviewed with the United States Consulate. \n286.  Prior to Satyaโs interview with the Consulate on November 3, 2006, Dewan \ncontacted him and requested that he bring documents evidencing his land or inheritance, which \nDewan claimed was necessary for the visa application.  Satya traveled to Chennai and met with \nDewan two days before his interview with the Consulate. During this meeting, Dewan instructed \nSatya regarding what to say during the Consulate interview. \n- 55 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 56 of 82 PageID #:  882\n287.  After the Consulate granted Satyaโs visa, Dewan contacted Satya and informed \nhim that he could leave for the United States as soon as he made a final payment of six lakhs \n(approximately $13,500).  Satya also had to borrow the funds necessary to make that payment. \n288.  On December 12, 2006, Satya traveled to Mumbai to pick up his passport and \nplane ticket from Dewanโs office.  After collecting Satyaโs fee payments, Dewan gave Satya a \nseries of forms in English to sign.  Satya asked for a translation, but Dewan refused, citing the \nworkersโ imminent plane departure.  Satya believed he had no choice but to sign the forms even \nthough he could not read them. \n289.  After he signed the forms, Satya was given his plane ticket and passport.  Satyaโs \nplane left Mumbai shortly thereafter and arrived in Houston, Texas on or about December 13, \n2006.  A Signal representative met Satya and other workers at the airport and drove them to the \nTexas Labor Camp. \n290.  The  morning  following  his  arrival,  Signal  hosted  an  orientation  for  the  new \nworkers.  During that meeting, Satya learned for the first time that he would need to pay an \nadditional $170 for his tools.  Satya was also forced to sign several more forms in English.  \nWhen Satya asked Signalโs representatives to explain what the forms said, they refused. \n291.  As a result of the conditions at the Texas Labor Camp, Satya felt isolated, lonely, \nand anxious.  At one point, he was hospitalized with an eye injury resulting from the conditions \nin which he was forced to weld.  Satya did not complain, however, because he was fearful Signal \nwould terminate his employment if he did.  His fear was based in part upon news that (1) Signal \nhad threatened to deport a worker who refused to do a particular job; and (2) another worker \nmissed two days of work and was forcibly deported by Signal.  Satya felt further compelled to \n- 56 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 57 of 82 PageID #:  883\nstay at Signal, because he could not repay the debts he incurred for the recruitment fees if he left \nand believed he would receive a green card if he stayed. \n292.  Defendants have never returned any of the โrecruitment feesโ incurred by Satya \nand never received provided a green card for Satya or his family. \n293.  Satya  relied  upon  Defendantsโ  promises  of  permanent  residency,  long-term \nemployment,  and  good  working  conditions.    He  would  not  have  incurred  substantial  debt, \nrelinquished  prior  employment,  or  agreed  to  work  for  Signal  in  the  absence  of  such  false \npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal would attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay  Defendantsโ  recruiting  fees,  Satya  felt  intimidated  into  acquiescence  and  compelled  to \ncontinue working for Signal. \n \nMoorthy Nadhamuni \n294.  In November 2006, while Moorthy Nadhamuni (โMoorthyโ) was working as a \nfitter in Dubai, he learned of a job opportunity in the United States through an advertisement in \nthe Indian newspaper, Dinathandy.  The advertisement was placed by Dewan Consultants, stated \nDewan was seeking to fill permanent job vacancies, and promised employment in the United \nStates along with permanent residency through a green card. \n295.  As a result of the advertisement, Moorthy took an emergency leave from his \nposition in Dubai and travelled to Chennai, India to attend an informational meeting about the \nopportunity. \n296.  Pol,  Dewan,  his  employee  Salimon,  and  others  were  present  at  the  meeting.  \nDuring the meeting, Dewan told Moorthy that he had to pass a test, which cost 500 rupees \n- 57 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 58 of 82 PageID #:  884\n(approximately $11), to be eligible for potential employment.  Moorthy paid the 500 rupees and \npassed the test. Salimon contacted Moorthy three days later and instructed him to attend an \nupcoming meeting. \n297.  Approximately  one  week  later,  Moorthy  attended  a  general  meeting  led  by \nDewan.  Several other workers were present.  Dewan informed the workers that they had been \nselected to work for Signal International in the United States at either a Texas or Mississippi \nfacility, that workers would be paid $14-18/hour, and that the workers would receive green \ncards. \n298.  Dewan informed the workers that they would first have to attend an interview \nwith the United States Consulate in Chennai.  If the interview went well, the workers would be \ngiven H-2B visa and would receive a green card approximately 18 months after working in the \nUnited States.  Dewan also promised the workers that, after they received their green cards, their \nfamilies could join them in the United States. \n299.  Dewan  stated  the  green  card  processing  would  cost  the  workers  eight  lakhs \n(approximately $18,000) in three installments.  First the workers had to pay Dewan 35,000 \nrupees (approximately $787).  Second, the workers would have to pay $3,871 to Pol and $3,871 \nto Burnett in cashierโs check by late January.  Finally, the workers would have to pay the \nremainder of the eight lakhs to Dewan.  Dewan further stated that the workersโ green cards \nwould be processed and their families could join them in the United States, but only if the \nworkers paid these fees. \n300.  Moorthy made the initial payment to Dewan with money he had saved from his \nprevious employment.  To accumulate the remainder of the eight lakhs, Moorthy borrowed funds \nfrom a local lender, pledging his wifeโs land as collateral, and pawned his wifeโs jewelry. \n- 58 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 59 of 82 PageID #:  885\n301.  After receiving Moorthyโs initial payment, Dewan informed Moorthy that his \ninterview with the Consulate was scheduled for December 2, 2006.  Dewan also informed \nMoorthy that he must bring an additional 4,600 rupees (approximately $103) for visa processing. \n302.  On December 2, 2006, Moorthy arrived in Chennai.  He met with Dewan prior to \nhis interview, during which Dewan coached Moorthy regarding the interview and provided him \nwith documents for the Consulate. \n303.  Moorthy  was  subsequently  approved  for  a  visa.    After  the  approval,  Dewan \ninstructed Moorthy to make the final payment of $3,871 to both Pol and Burnett. \n304.  On  approximately  February  13,  2007,  Moorthy  met  Dewan  in  Chennai  and \nreceived  a  ticket  from  Chennai  to  Mumbai.    Dewan  said  that  Moorthy  would  receive  the \nremainder of his ticket to the United States in Mumbai. \n305.  On February 14, 2007, Moorthy travelled from Chennai to Dewanโs office in \nMumbai.  There, he and several other workers were called one by one to make their final \npayments to Pol, Burnett, and Dewan.  Some workers were unable to make the payments and \nwere informed by Dewanโs representatives that they would not receive plane tickets and would \nforfeit all prior payments if they did not make the final payment in full.  Having witnessed this, \nMoorthy felt compelled to make his payments.  After making that payment, Moorthy was \nrequired to sign several forms in English, which Dewanโs representatives refused to translate. \n306.  On February 15, 2007, Moorthy departed Mumbai for Houston, Texas.  When he \narrived in Houston, a Signal representative picked him up at the airport and brought Moorthy \nalong with the other workers to the Texas Labor Camp. \n307.  Moorthy was appalled by the living conditions, whichโas described aboveโ\nwere horrid.  They were much worse than the living conditions he had experienced previously \n- 59 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 60 of 82 PageID #:  886\nwhen working in Dubai and Singapore.  Signal refused to serve vegetarian food, even though \nMoorthy is a vegetarian for religious reasons.  Meanwhile, Signal continued deducting fees from \nMoorthyโs paychecks for food and accommodations. \n308.  Moorthy felt trapped and believed that, because of the debt he had incurred, he \nhad to continue working for Signal despite the reprehensible conditions.  In addition, based on \nthe promises made to him previously, Moorthy also believed that he would receive a green card \nif he continued to work for Signal and that his family could eventually join him in the United \nStates.  Accordingly, Moorthy continued to work for Signal without complaint. \n309.  Defendants  have  never  returned  any  of  the  โrecruitment  feesโ  incurred  by \nMoorthy and never provided a green card for Moorthy or his family. \n310.  Moorthy relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency, long-term \nemployment,  and  good  working  conditions.    He  would  not  have  incurred  substantial  debt, \nrelinquished  prior  employment,  or  agreed  to  work  for  Signal  in  the  absence  of  such  false \npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal would attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees, Moorthy felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \nRajendran Sappani \n311.  In 2006, Rajendran Sappani (โSappaniโ)  was working in Singapore when he \nlearned  about  a  newspaper  advertisement  placed  by  Dewan  offering  welders  and  fitters \nemployment and permanent residency in the United States. \n312.  Sappani learned that Dewan Consultants was holding interviews for the positions \nin Chennai, India, and that the last date to interview was November 11, 2006. \n- 60 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 61 of 82 PageID #:  887\n313.  On or around November 8, 2006, Sappani left his job in Singapore and returned to \nhis hometown of Trichy, India, before travelling to Chennai for an interview and testing with \nDewan. \n314.  Sappani interviewed with Dewan and passed a written pipe fitting test.  After the \ntest, Sappani he was required to pay eight lakh (approximately $18,000) for the employment \nopportunity, visa processing, and green card.  He was also required to make an initial payment of \n45,000 rupees to Dewan.  Dewan also informed Sappani he would need to pass an interview with \nthe Consulate and that, if the Consulate did not stamp his passport with a visa, Sappani would \nforfeit the 45,000 rupees payment. \n315.  To  raise  the  funds  necessary  to  pay  the  recruitment  fees,  Sappani  borrowed \nmoney from lenders.  To obtain one of the loans, the lender required Sappani to prove that the \nfunds were for a green card.  Sappani contacted Dewan who faxed a letter to Sappani confirming \nthat Sappani would be receiving a green card.  Sappani presented the letter to the bank and \nreceived the funds.  Sappani also sold his wifeโs jewelryโwith the exception of her wedding \nband, which he used as collateral for a loanโand mortgaged his familyโs house and land.  As a \nresult, his family now pays 1,000 rupees per month to live in the house.   \n316.  Subsequently, Sappani attended an interview with the United States Consulate \nand was processed for a visa.  In December 2006, prior to leaving for the United States, Sappani \nwas instructed to travel to Dewanโs office in Mumbai, where he paid the final recruiting fees, \nincluding an additional 1,500-rupee fee for a medical certificate.  Dewan withheld Sappaniโs \npassport until the final payments were made.  Sappani was then required to sign several papers \nquickly, without an opportunity to read them, before he received his ticket to travel to the United \nStates. \n- 61 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 62 of 82 PageID #:  888\n317.  On or about December 18, 2006, Sappani arrived at Signalโs Orange, Texas \nfacility.  Sappani was shocked by the conditions at the Texas Labor Camp, which were much \nworse than he had experienced in Singapore.  But Sappani felt that he could not turn back \nbecause have no way of repaying the money he had borrowed.  As a result, Sappani was afraid to \ndo anything that might create problems for him at Signal. \n318.  Defendants have never returned any of the โrecruitment feesโ incurred by Sappani \nand never provided a green card for Sappani. \n319.  Sappani relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency, long-term \nemployment,  and  good  working  conditions.    He  would  not  have  incurred  substantial  debt, \nrelinquished  prior  employment,  or  agreed  to  work  for  Signal  in  the  absence  of  such  false \npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal would attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees, Sappani felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \nRajendran Subramani \n320.  Rajendran  Subramani  (โRajendranโ)  is  a  welder  and  structural  fitter  from \nTiruchirappali, India.  Rajendran supports his mother and family financially. \n321.  In or about 2006, Rajendran was working as welder in Malaysia.  His friend \ninformed him about an advertisement in a Hindu newspaper offering the opportunity to live and \nwork in the United States as welder or fitter and obtain a green card.  Rajendran reviewed the \nadvertisement and confirmed that it promised the opportunity to get a green card in the United \nStates.  To take advantage of this opportunity, Rajendran travelled to India to interview for a \nposition.    \n- 62 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 63 of 82 PageID #:  889\n322.  On or about January 7, 2007, Rajendran interviewed with Salimon, an employee \nof Dewan.  Rajendran understood that Dewan was recruiting workers on behalf of Signal.  \nDuring this interview, Salimon represented to Rajendran that he would make $18.00 per hour in \nthe United States, that there would be opportunities to receive overtime pay, and the job with \nSignal would last for at least two years.  Salimon further represented Rajendran would initially \nreceive a visa every six months, but that after two years Signal would get a green card for \nRajendran and help him bring his family to the United Sates.   \n323.  Despite the fact that Rajendran had a two-year contract for his job in Malaysia, he \nwas very interested in obtaining a green card and earning an income that was higher than what he \nwas making in Malaysia.  Rajendran felt that this employment opportunity would permit him to \nmake a better life for his family and to support his aging mother. \n324.  During the interview, Rajendran spoke with Salimon about his work arrangement \nin Malaysia and described the accommodations, food, and benefits that were provided by the \nemployer.    Salimon  promised  Rajendran  that  Signal  would  provide  similar  type  of \naccommodations, food, and benefits, including that he would only have to share an apartment \nwith a few men. \n325.  Salimon told Rajendran that it would cost him eight lahks for the opportunity to \nwork for Signal and receive a green card.  Based on the representations that Salimon made on \nbehalf of Signal, including the representations about receiving a green card for himself and his \nfamily, Rajendran agreed to pay the money. \n326.  Rajendran had saved about 100,000 rupees during his time working in Malaysia, \nbut still needed to borrow an additional 700,000 rupees to pay the recruitment fee.  Rajendranโs \nmother used to work for a wealthy family, the Muthus, who agreed to loan Rajendran the \n- 63 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 64 of 82 PageID #:  890\n700,000 rupees at an interest rate of three percent (3%) per month, a total of thirty-six percent \n(36%) interest per year. \n327.  In or about January 2007, Rajendran paid 40,000 rupees ($900) to Salimon as an \ninitial deposit in order to obtain an interview with the U.S. Consulate.  Approximately four \nweeks  later,  Salimon  called  Rajendran  and  told  him  that  his  interview  was  scheduled  for \nFebruary 7, 2007.  Rajendran met with Salimon in Madras in order to coach him for interview. \n328.  Rajendran met with the embassy on or about February 7, 2007, and after the \nmeeting they told him that his passport would be sent to Salimon once it was stamped.  Several \ndays after the interview with the embassy Rajendran received a phone call from Dewan saying \nthat they had his passport, but that he needed to come to Dewanโs office in Bombay to pay the \nremaining 760,000 rupees, which he did prior to departing for the United States. \n329.  On  February  15,  2007,  Rajendran  traveled  to  the  United  States.    A  Signal \nemployee picked up Rajendran and other Indian workers at the airport in Houston, Texas and \ndrove them to the Texas Labor Camp. \n330.  Rajendran thought that the Texas Labor Camp resembled a prisonโit was very \nisolated, it was surrounded by a fence, and guarded by security guards. \n331.  A Signal employee had Rajendran and other Indian workers complete paperwork \nwhen they arrived at the Texas Labor Camp.  Signal did not, however, translate or explain the \npaperwork for the Indian workers. \n332.  At the Texas Labor Camp, Rajendran was required to share an overcrowded \nbunkhouse with more than twenty (20) men.   The bunk beds were so tightly packed together that \nRajendran and others were forced to sleep with their suitcases in their beds with them.  The toilet \nand showering facilities were insufficient and unsanitary.  Indeed, there was only bathroom and \n- 64 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 65 of 82 PageID #:  891\none shower between the twenty men.  There was no privacy at the bunkhouse and sleep was very \ndifficult due to the close quarters, oppressive smells, and constant noise from the workers \ncoming and going to their different shifts. \n333.  As described above, the food that Signal provided was deplorable.  Rajendran \noften became ill from the food, which was frequently rotten and/or left out for long periods of \ntime. \n334.  Signal deducted approximately $1,050 per month from Rajendranโs paychecks for \nroom and board.  Prior to arriving at the Texas Labor Camp, Rajendran had not been informed \nthis amount would be withheld from his paychecks.   \n335.  As a result of the conditions at the Texas Labor Camp, Rajendran asked Signal if \nhe could live somewhere else, but he was told Signal would still deduct $1,050 per month from \nhis paychecks if he moved.  Because of the substantial debt Rajendran had incurred to pay the \nrecruitment fees, he could not afford to pay for accommodations outside the Texas Labor Camp \nand still pay Signal $1,050 per month.  Rajendran was, in effect, compelled to stay in the Texas \nLabor Camp. \n336.  Rajendran and other workers complained to Signal about the awful conditions at \nthe Texas Labor Camp.  In response, Signal threatened to send Rajendran and other workers \nback to India if they continued to complain or spoke to others about Signalโs actions.  Faced with \nthreats of deportation, and crushing debt in Indian, Rajendran felt compelled to continue his \nemployment at Signal.  \n337.  Notwithstanding the prior promises of employment for two years and a green card \nfor Rajendran and his family, during a meeting in June 2007, Signal informed Rajendran and the \nothers who voiced concern about the conditions at the Texas Labor Camp that they could not \n- 65 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 66 of 82 PageID #:  892\nwork for Signal after July 30, 2007 and that Signal would not renew their visas.  At that point, \nRajendran realized that the promises about the length of his employment and Signal obtaining a \ngreen card for Rajendran and his family were lies. \n338.  Defendants  have  never  returned  any  of  the  โrecruitment  feesโ  incurred  by \nRajendran and never provided a green card for Rajendran or his family. \n339.  Rajendran relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency, long-term \nemployment,  and  good  working  conditions.    He  would  not  have  incurred  substantial  debt, \nrelinquished  prior  employment,  or  agreed  to  work  for  Signal  in  the  absence  of  such  false \npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal would attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees, Rajendran felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \nVenkata Satya Sivagi Rao Talabathulla \n340.  In or about May 2006, while working as a structural welder in Andhra Pradesh, \nIndia, Venkata Satya Sivagi Rao Talabathulla (โTalabathullaโ) saw an advertisement in the local \nnewspaper, Eenadu, for potential employment in the United States.  The advertisement stated \nthat an American company was hiring welders and pipefitters for its facilities in the United \nStates.  The advertisement gave certain dates for tests and interviews in Chennai, and provided \nthe contact information for Dewan. \n341.  Talabathulla and three of his friends traveled to Chennai 16 hours by train to \ndiscuss the opportunity with Dewan.  Dewan explained the job opportunity, represented that it \nwas for long-term employment, that there was ample work, and that workers would be processed \nfor green cards.  Specifically, Dewan informed Talabathulla that he would work under an H-2B \n- 66 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 67 of 82 PageID #:  893\nvisa for the initial nine months and then would be processed for and receive a green card.  \nDewan also explained that that Talabathulla would need to undergo a testing process that was \nbeing conducted over the next couple of days. \n342.  Dewan required that Talabathulla pay two lakhs (approximately $4,500), within \n10 days to proceed.  Talabathulla needed to go back home to Andhra Pradesh in order to obtain \nthe money.  Before leaving to obtain the money, Talabathulla took and passed the fitting test.  \nDuring the test, Talabathulla met Pol, who informed him that the job opportunity was for Signal.  \nPol reiterated the promise of permanent residency in the United States.  \n343.  Talabathulla paid two lakhs to Dewan in November 2006.  In order to pay those \nfunds, Talabathulla had to borrow money from his father, who in turn borrowed from lenders at \nan interest rate of 3% per month (43% per year). \n344.  After receiving Talabathullaโs payment, Dewan informed Talabathulla that he \nneeded to pay an additional $5,373 to Malvern Burnett, $5,373 to Michael Pol, and another \n$3,680 to Dewan.  Talabathulla ultimately paid these amounts.  To do so, Talabathulla had to \nborrow more money from his father, who in turn borrowed the money from lenders, pledging his \nhouse as collateral for the loan. \n345.  In December 2006, Talabathulla traveled to Dewanโs office in Mumbai in order to \nreceive his passport and airline ticket to the United States.  Talabathulla arrived shortly before \nhis plane was scheduled to depart for the United States.  During this meeting, Dewan required \nthat  Talabathulla  pay  the  remaining  recruitment  fees  in  order  to  receive  his  passport.  \nTalabathulla felt that he had no choice but to follow Dewanโs directions.  After receiving \nTalabathullaโs  payment,  Dewan  gave  Talabathulla  his  passport  as  well  as  an  Offer  of \nEmployment letter from Signal that was in English and had not been translated.  Dewan refused \n- 67 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 68 of 82 PageID #:  894\nto provide a receipt for the payment.   Before leaving for the United States, Dewan continued to \nassure Talabathulla that he would receive a green card.  \n346.  When Talabathulla arrived in the United States, Signal informed him that it going \nto deduct approximately $1,050 per month from his salary for room and board.  He was also \ninformed that he would be charged these amounts regardless of whether he lived at the Texas \nLabor Camp.   This was the first time Talabathulla had heard that he would be charged for room \nand board.  As described above, the conditions at the Texas Labor Camp were deplorable.  \nBecause Talabathulla could not afford to pay for living expenses twice and repay his loans, he \nfelt compelled to remain at the Texas Labor Camp.  \n347.  While  he  was  at  the  Texas  Labor  Camp,  Defendants  continued  to  assure \nTalabathulla that he would receive a green card.   \n348.  During the spring of 2007, Talabathulla he that Signal had threatened to deport \nother Indian workers back to India.  Signal ultimately transferred Talabathulla to its facility in \nPascagoula, Mississippi and reduced his wages.  In doing so, however, Signal again reiterated its \npromise that there would be ample work at the Mississippi facility, which ultimately turned out \nnot to be true.  As a result of the threats of deportation and the debt he had incurred to pay the \nrecruitment fees, Talabathulla felt compelled to remain at Signal, work at its Mississippi facility, \nand accept the lower wages. \n349.  Defendants  have  never  returned  any  of  the  โrecruitment  feesโ  incurred  by \nTalabathulla and never provided a green card for Talabathulla. \n350.  Talabathulla relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency, long-term \nemployment,  and  good  working  conditions.    He  would  not  have  incurred  substantial  debt, \nrelinquished  prior  employment,  or  agreed  to  work  for  Signal  in  the  absence  of  such  false \n- 68 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 69 of 82 PageID #:  895\npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal would attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees, Talabathulla felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled to \ncontinue working for Signal. \nSammanasunathan Siluvaimuthu \n351.  In or around 2005, while working as a welder in Abu Dhabi, Sammanasunathan \nSiluvaimuthu (โSiluvaimuthuโ) saw a newspaper advertisement placed by Dewan seeking fitters \nand welders.  The advertisement offered the opportunity to work in the United States and obtain \na green card.   \n352.  Siluvaimuthu  spoke  with  Dewan  and  was  told  to  attend  an  upcoming \ninformational meeting if he was interested in the job opportunity.  During the call, Dewan \npromised Siluvaimuthu that he would receive a green card as part of the job opportunity.   \n353.  Siluvaimuthu  subsequently  attended  the  informational  meeting,  along \napproximately 100 other Indian workers.  Pol and Dewan were present at the meeting and \nexplained the job opportunity.  Among other things, they represented that the job opportunity \nwas with Signal and that Signal would obtain permanent residency for the workers in the United \nStates. \n354.  Pol and Dewan told Siluvaimuthu and the other workers that they had to pay \nrecruitment fees for the job opportunity totaling the equivalent of six or seven lakhs.  They \nexplained that the workers could pay the recruitment fees in three installments, if they did not \nhave enough money up front. \n355.  Siluvaimuthu did not believe he had enough money to pay the recruitment fees. \n- 69 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 70 of 82 PageID #:  896\n356.  In or around November 2006, however, Siluvaimuthu learned that some of his \nfriends were going to work for Signal through Dewan Consultants.  Siluvaimuthu had dreamed \nof living in the United States, and decided to pursue the job opportunity with Signal.  To that \nend, he met with Sachin Dewan in Chennai for testing.  After passing the test, Dewan informed \nSiluvaimuthu that the recruitment fees had risen to 8.5 lakhs (approximately $19,125). \n357.  Siluvaimuthu was informed that he would have to pay 3.5 lakhs (approximately \n$7,875)  up  front.    Siluvaimuthu  paid  the  initial  3.5  lakhs  by  demand  draft.    To  do  so, \nSiluvaimuthu  borrowed  money  from  friends  at  an  interest  rate  of  5  percent  per  month.  \nSiluvaimuthu received a loan for the remainder of the 8.5 lakhs.  As collateral for the loan, \nSiluvaimuthu pledged his house and his wifeโs jewelry. \n358.  Subsequently, Siluvaimuthu met with Dewan to pay the remaining recruiting fees.  \nDuring that meeting, Dewan represented to Siluvaimuthu that he would receive a green card in \napproximately 6 months and then could bring his family to join him in the United States.  Dewan \nfurther  represented  that  the  employment  with  Signal  would  be  long-term  and  the  living \nconditions would be comfortable, safe, and sanitary. \n359.  On or around November 24, 2006, Siluvaimuthu received a visa from the United \nStates Consulate in Chennai.  Following Siluvaimuthuโs interview at the Consulate, Dewan kept \nSiluvaimuthuโs passport. \n360.  Shortly before he was to leave for the United States, Siluvaimuthu attended a \nmeeting at Dewanโs office, during which he was forced to sign forms in English without a \ntranslation.  Siluvaimuthu felt compelled to sign the forms because his plane to the United States \nwas leaving shortly, he had paid the recruitment fees to Dewan, and Dewan still had his passport.  \n- 70 - \n\nCase 1:13-cv-00499-MAC-ZJH   Document 76   Filed 09/16/14   Page 71 of 82 PageID #:  897\nDewan only returned Siluvaimuthuโs passport immediately before he boarded the flight to the \nUnited States. \n361.  When Siluvaimuthu arrived at the Texas Labor Camp, he was horrified by the \nconditions.    Signal  subsequently  informed  him,  for  the  first  time,  that  it  would  deduct \napproximately $1,050 per month from his wages for room and board, regardless of whether he \nlived at the Texas Labor Camp.  Despite the conditions, Siluvaimuthu felt compelled to remain at \nthe Texas Labor Camp and continue working because he could not afford to pay twice for room \nand board and also repay the debt he had incurred in India. \n362.  Defendants  have  never  returned  any  of  the  โrecruitment  feesโ  incurred  by \nSiluvaimuthu and never provided a green card for Siluvaimuthu. \n363.  Siluvaimuthu relied upon Defendantsโ promises of permanent residency, long-\nterm employment, and good working conditions.  He would not have incurred substantial debt, \nrelinquished  prior  employment,  or  agreed  to  work  for  Signal  in  the  absence  of  such  false \npromises.  Because of his fear that Signal would attempt to deport him, his fear of mistreatment \nand abuse by Signal, and his need to repay the substantial debts he and his family had incurred to \npay Defendantsโ recruiting fees, Siluvaimuthu felt intimidated into acquiescence and compelled \nto continue working for Signal. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nTHE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION ACT OF 2003 \nForced Labor (18 U.S.C. ยง 1589) (Trafficking with Respect to Peonage, Slavery, Involuntary \nServitude, or Forced Labor) (18 U.S.C. ยง 1590) \nAll Defendants \n364.
