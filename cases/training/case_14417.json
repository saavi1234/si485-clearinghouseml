Represented by counsel, he brings this civil rights action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, on behalf of himself and other similarly situated inmates at four prisons, three of which are located in this judicial district. Under 28 U.S.C. § 1915A, the Court is required to conduct a prompt threshold review of the complaint. Accepting Plaintiff's allegations as true, the Court finds that Plaintiff has articulated a colorable federal cause of action against Defendants for constitutional, statutory, and supplemental state law claims arising from the Defendants' cell shakedowns, strip searches, use of excessive force, denial of medical care, and related actions at the Illinois River Correctional Center beginning in April 2014, and subsequently at Menard, Big Muddy River, and Lawrence Correctional Centers. Accordingly, pursuant to Local Rule 72.1(a)(2), this action is REFERRED to United States Magistrate Judge Philip M. Frazier for further pre-trial proceedings. Further, this entire matter shall be REFERRED to United States Magistrate Judge Frazier for disposition, pursuant to Local Rule 72.2(b)(2) and 28 U.S.C. § 636(c), if all parties consent to such a referral. Counsel for Plaintiff may initiate service without further delay. Defendants are ORDERED to timely file an appropriate responsive pleading to the complaint and shall not waive filing a reply pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(g). Signed by Judge Staci M. Yandle on 3/23/2015. (tjk)THIS TEXT ENTRY IS AN ORDER OF THE COURT. NO FURTHER DOCUMENTATION WILL BE MAILED. (Entered: 03/23/2015)"

Additional Defendants continue to appear in the case as they are served and request representation. Accordingly, in order to facilitate efficient use of resources, and with no objection from Plaintiffs, Defendants shall have until 2/28/17 to file their answers to Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs' have subpoenaed IDOC for the contact information of approximately 25 named defendants who have not yet been served. Counsel are awaiting response to that subpoena which was served in January. For good cause shown, and with no objection from the Defendants, the Court extends the time to effect service of the Amended Complaint on those defendants that are the subject of the subpoena until 3/31/17. The parties have also reached an impasse as to two issues concerning esi: 1) search or personal email, text messages, and social media of Defendants, and 2) the scope of time covering searched for esi - specifically, whether the time near the filing of the complaint should be included in esi searches. These issues will be addressed at the 2/23/17 discovery dispute conference. The parties are allowed an additional 3 pages for their submissions to address these two additional issues.

Plaintiff Miller has again filed a pro se motion with this Court regarding money taken from his trust fund account to pay his filing fee. (Plaintiff claims this document is not a motion; however, he clearly seeks relief from what he alleges to be too much money being taken from his account.) He attempted to file the motion in his original case, 3:16-cv-416; however, since that matter has been consolidated with this suit, all pleadings filed in 16-416 are to be filed in this case. Plaintiff is represented by counsel in this matter, and has twice already been told he shall not file motions, such as the one before the Court, pro se. (See Docs. 383, 387). Again, the Court will make this very clear: Since he proceeds represented by counsel, other than pleadings seeking dismissal of his current counsel, Plaintiff Miller SHALL NOT file documents pro se, either in this case, 15-309, or in 16-416. Plaintiff Miller is reminded that he could be subject to sanctions, personally, for disobeying an order of the Court. If he feels there is an issue with the amount of money being taken from his trust fund account, Plaintiff may consult his attorneys regarding the issue. The Clerk of Court is DIRECTED to STRIKE the Motion at Doc. 398. Signed by Magistrate Judge Stephen C. Williams on 9/7/2017. (rms2)THIS TEXT ENTRY IS AN ORDER OF THE COURT.

The sections of the manual relating to the use of formations shall remain fully redacted and undisclosed. All other redactions contain information that is either potentially relevant or highly relevant, and all other sections of the manual shall therefore be produced unredacted. The TACT manual, however, is subject to the attorneys' eyes only protective order already put in place. In addition, Defendants raised an oral motion asking the Court to reconsider a portion of its May 9, 2018 ruling (Doc. 450). Defendants asked that the documents relating to STGs ordered produced in the Court's May 9 ruling be retained by defense counsel at their Chicago office while allowing access to Plaintiffs' counsel to review the documents. The motion is DENIED. While the Court understands Defendants' concerns regarding security, the Court has no reason to believe that Plaintiffs' counsel do not take their obligations under the attorneys' eyes order seriously. To require Plaintiffs' counsel to have to come to defense counsels' office at prearranged times in order to view the documents in question is overly burdensome and potentially prejudicial to Plaintiffs. Finally, the Court GRANTS the parties request to extend the deadline for class certification briefing. A Motion for Class Certification shall be filed no later than July 22, 2018.

Plaintiff asks the Court to reconsider its ruling denying his motion for a default judgment and granting Defendant Butler's request for an extension. Plaintiff has provided no new legal grounds, facts, or extraordinary circumstances that would justify reconsideration. In fact, Plaintiff's main argument is that he filed \"first,\" and prior to consolidation. This is not accurate; Plaintiff's case was consolidated on 3/7/16, three days before he alleges he filed the motion. Nor was Butler's motion for an extension untimely as she had until 3/8/16 to file an answer, and requested an extension on that day. Plaintiff's argument that he was \"first\" is also unavailing; the Court may rule on motions in any order at its discretion. If Plaintiff wishes to leave the class action, he may file a motion on that point, but it is unlikely that the Court would appoint him an attorney in those circumstances. Signed by Magistrate Judge Stephen C. Williams on 3/28/2016. (jcp)THIS TEXT ENTRY IS AN ORDER OF THE COURT. NO FURTHER DOCUMENTATION WILL BE MAILED. (Entered: 03/28/2016)"

While \"[s]ecrecy is fine at the discovery stage, before the materials enter the judicial record,\" \"those documents, usually a small subset of all discovery, that influence or underpin the judicial decision are open to public inspection unless they meet the definition of trade secrets or other categories of bona fide long-term confidentiality.\" Baxter Int'l., Inc. v. Abbott Labs., 297 F.3d 544, 545 (7th Cir. 2002). \"Documents that affect the disposition of federal litigation are presumptively open to public view, even if the litigants strongly prefer secrecy, unless a statute, rule, or privilege justifies confidentiality.\" In re Specht, 622 F.3d 697, 701 (7th Cir. 2010). Thus, sealing documents is not justified simply by an agreement between the parties to keep matters private. Accordingly, Defendants shall SHOW CAUSE by March 10, 2025 demonstrating adequate grounds for sealing Plaintiffs' responses. Absent that, Plaintiffs' responses to Defendants motions in limine will be unsealed.Signed by Judge Staci M. Yandle on 3/3/2025. (mah). THIS TEXT ENTRY IS AN ORDER OF THE COURT. NO FURTHER DOCUMENTATION WILL BE MAILED. (Entered: 03/03/2025)"

The Court divided the ESI production into three groups: (1) email production for identified supervisors for the time period surrounding the shakedown, with priority given to 10 of these individuals; (2) email production from 10 individuals during time period after suit was filed; and (3) production of personal communications for 10 individuals after suit was filed. Defendants indicated there has been a higher than expected number of documents that have come to fruition as a result of their email search. As to Group 1, they have completed production as to one of the prioritized individuals and have roughly 5000 documents for two other individuals. Defendants sought three weeks to examine the 5000 documents as to these two individuals to search for sensitive information that, in IDOC's opinion, should be redacted. Defendants shall produce the 5000 batch documents no later than April 12, 2017. This matter is set for a Discovery Dispute Conference on April 20, 2017 at 3:15 p.m. The parties shall give an update as to production for the other two groups at that conference.

    "summary": "<p>On March 19, 2015, an Illinois prisoner filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and state law against numerous members of the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) tactical team &ldquo;Orange Crush,&rdquo; the wardens at Illinois River, Menard, Big Muddy River, and Lawrence Correctional Centers, and other IDOC officials. The plaintiff, represented by Loevy &amp; Loevy and the Uptown People's Law Center, sought injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and punitive damages, both for himself individually and for a class of other similarly-situated Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) inmates. Specifically, the named plaintiff claimed that during an April 2014 search of cells at Illinois River Correctional Center, the members of the IDOC tactical team \"Orange Crush\" beat, abused, and sexually humiliated the plaintiff, destroyed his property, and otherwise inflicted punishment for the sole purpose of causing humiliation and needless pain. The plaintiff further alleged that this conduct at Illinois River was not an aberration. Rather, Orange Crush conducted similarly abusive search procedures at three other IDOC facilities: Menard, Big Muddy River, and Lawrence Correctional Centers. The plaintiff sought to represent a class consisting of all IDOC inmates subjected to &ldquo;shakedowns&rdquo; in 2014, as well as all present and future inmates of these four IDOC facilities.</p>\r\n<p>In his complaint, the plaintiff alleged violations of the Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, when state officials intentionally, wantonly, and/or maliciously inflicted unnecessary physical and emotional pain and suffering on IDOC inmates. In addition, the plaintiff argued that the defendants' strip search procedures violate several provisions of the Prison Rape Elimination Act National Standards, 28 C.F.R. &sect; 115. Lastly, the plaintiff claimed that the defendants acted with the intent or knowledge that there was a high probability that their conduct would inflict severe emotional distress upon the inmates.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to District Judge Staci M. Yandle. It was initially assigned to Magistrate Judge Philip M. Frazier, but was reassigned to Magistrate Judge Stephen C. Williams on October 16, 2015.</p>\r\n<p>Various defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim on May 29, 2015, and this motion was granted in part and denied in part on January 28, 2016. The court dismissed the portions of the complaint dealing with the Prison Rape Elimination Act, as the Act did not provide for private cause of action. The court determined that the remainder of the complaint was sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. The court (Magistrate Judge Williams) approved a confidentiality order on July 10, 2017. The plaintiffs then filed a motion to certify the class on October 12, 2018.</p>\r\n<p>As the litigation progressed, the Court granted many motions to consolidate cases by plaintiffs alleging similarly improper stripe search techniques and cell shakedowns. The complete list of docket numbers for the consolidated cases can be found at the end of this summary. In January of 2019, a number of cases were then severed because their facts fell outside of the class perimeters including time frame and location. The severed cases included Turner v. Spiller, et al., 3:16-cv-131-SMY-MAB; Williams v. Mull, et al., 3:15-cv-523-SMY-MAB; and, Chairs v. IDOC, et al., 3:15-cv-1359-SMY-MAB, each in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois.</p>\r\n<p>On March 26, 2020, Judge Staci Yandle of the Southern District of Illinois issued an order granting Plaintiffs' class certification request. The class consists of all prisoners housed at:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Menard Correctional Center between April 4, 2014 and April 16, 2014;</li>\r\n<li>Illinois River Correctional Center between April 21, 2014 and April 29, 2014;</li>\r\n<li>Big Muddy Correctional Center between May 12, 2014 and May 19, 2014; or</li>\r\n<li>Lawrence Lawrence Correctional Center between July 7, 2014 and July 11, 2014</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Each of the below cases were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois and consolidated with this case (Ross v. Gossett) as of February 2020:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Fisher v. McCallistor, 15-cv-00007-SMY-RJD</li>\r\n<li>Hamilton v. McCallister, 15-cv-281-SMY-SCW</li>\r\n<li>Miller v.

Butler, 17-cv-00494-SMY</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Discovery commenced in May 2020. On June 4, 2020, the government filed an appeal of the earlier class certifications to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</p>\r\n<p>While the district court initially denied the government&rsquo;s request for a stay on May 22, 2020, the government brought a motion to reconsider in view of the Seventh Circuit granting the petition. The parties agreed that formal class notice should not be issued until after the Seventh Circuit ruled on the appeal. However, the district court allowed fact discovery to continue. On October 1, 2020, the district court granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for extension of time, setting the deadline for fact discovery on December 15, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>The government moved for a protective order on November 12, 2020. The motion was referred to Magistrate Judge Mark A. Beatty on November 16, 2020, and granted on December 4, 2020. The subject of the motion was 178 Requests to Admit (RTAs) issued to all 22 defendants. Judge Beatty noted the RTAs were not well tailored and came after the defendants had already answered 224 interrogatories, 54 requests to produce, and depositions. Accordingly, Judge Beatty found the RTAs improper.</p>\r\n<p>On May 5, 2022, the Seventh Circuit (Judges Daniel A. Manion, Ilana D. Rovner, and Amy St. Eve) affirmed the district court&rsquo;s class certification. 33 F.4th 433. The motion to rehear en banc was denied on July 6, 2022. 2022 WL 2500420.</p>\r\n<p>On September 7, 2023, Judge Yandle ordered the parties to mandatory mediation. The mediator to serve on this action was selected.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 22, 2024, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on Counts I, II, and II of the Second Amended Complaint, seeking to dismiss these claims against all but nine defendants. On January 8, 2025, the district court released a ruling on this motion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Defendants argued that plaintiffs failed to present evidence of a uniform plan to violate their Eighth Amendment rights, and there was no evidence of personal involvement by each supervisory defendant in such a plan. However, the Court found sufficient evidence to deny summary judgment to most of the supervisory defendants, indicating evidence that defendants designed a plan. The court granted summary judgment as to defendants Jones and Gilreath who they found to have minimal involvement in the shakedowns, but denied summary judgment as to the other defendants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Defendants also moved for summary judgment with respects to Counts II (conspiracy) and III (failure to intervene), arguing that these claims were premised on the success of the underlying Eighth Amendment claim. The court disagreed, finding evidence of a plan among defendants and their awareness of, yet disregard for, prisoner complaints. The court denied summary judgment on Counts II and III.&nbsp;The court also denied granting qualified immunity to the defendants. Additionally, the defendants moved for summary judgment on plaintiffs' official capacity claims against the Director of IDOC. The Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants as the Director is amenable to suit only to remedy \"an ongoing violation of federal law\", and plaintiffs did not identify nor articulate an ongoing threat they will experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, the defendants moved for summary judgment on Count V, which alleged a state law claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, and this was granted by the court. The court also responded to the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the claims against the non-supervisory defendants, and the court stated it would take it under advisement and provide plaintiffs with time to respond.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1); Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b)(2); SDIL-LR 73.1(b).  \nFor the following reasons, Judge Beatty’s Report is ADOPTED.  \n  When neither timely nor specific objections are made, the Court need not conduct a de \nnovo review of the Report.  See Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140 (1985).  Instead, the Court reviews \nthe Report for clear error.  Johnson v. Zema Systems Corp., 170 F.3d 734, 739 (7th Cir. 1999).  \nThe  Court  may  then  “accept,  reject,  or  modify,  in  whole  or  in  part,  the  findings  or \nrecommendations made by the magistrate judge.” 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1). \n  Here, Judge Beatty thoroughly discussed and supported his conclusion that Plaintiffs \nTurner, Williams, and Chairs’ claims should be severed from this putative class action and that \ntheir previously filed cases should be reinstated.   The Court finds no clear error with Judge \nBeatty’s  findings,  analysis,  or  conclusions,  and  accordingly,  adopts  his  Report  and \nPage 1 of 2 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 508   Filed 03/25/19   Page 2 of 2   Page ID #21436\nRecommendation in its entirety.   \n  Accordingly, the following cases are hereby SEVERED from this action: Turner v.

Brown, 787 F.3d 851, 857-58 (7th Cir. 2015).  While the Court \nacknowledges the plain reading of the rule, given the number of defendants in this case, it finds \nthat dismissing the defendants identified in the Motion is appropriate in this case.  See Madsen v. \nPark City, 6 F. Supp. 2d 938, 943 (N.D. Ill. 1998) (“In a multiple defendant case, it is permissible \nto voluntarily dismiss just some of the defendants.”).  Accordingly, the Motion is GRANTED and \nThe following Defendants are DISMISSED without prejudice:\nPage 1 of 2\n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY-MAB   Document 516   Filed 08/21/19   Page 2 of 2   Page ID #21452\nRichard Harrington Jason Migneron Michael Samuel  \nRodney Brady Jason Morris George Welborn  \nBrendan Ankrom   Wendy Parks Tony Payne, Jr.\nStephanie Beasley   Gary Perkins   Michael Monje  \nRobert Blackwell Brandon Richey Tracy Lee\nMark Bower Minh Scott John Carter\nKyle Brooks Eric Shelton   Louis Browder\nChristopher Cales Mitch Simmons Ventures Jackson\nAaron Campbell   Sam Taylor   Denise Minor  \nJames Cissell   Andrew Volk Daniel Sullivan\nJosh Curry   Rene Waters   Jack Townely\nSamuel Dillon   James Best   Jeffrey Julius  \nJustin Dircks   Kent Brookman   Richard Lynch\nBryan Easton John Tourville  Michael Durbin \nM.

In the spring of 2014, the Department initiated a series of facility-wide searches at \ncorrectional facilities across the State.  The searches were designed to sweep for contraband—\nweapons, drugs, and more—and succeeded in those aims, identifying contraband and securing the \nintegrity of the Department’s facilities. \nPlaintiffs are current and former inmates at four of these facilities.  They allege in this class \naction that something went wrong: that the searches at these four facilities were not conducted in \na manner that furthered the Department’s penological goals but were instead intentionally designed \nand executed to inflict cruelty.  Indeed, plaintiffs’ argument is more expansive still:  They argue \nnot that there were isolated deviations from Department policy during the four facility-wide \nsearches, but that the senior leadership of the Department and the facilities in question designed \nand executed a uniform plan intentionally intended to “inflict unnecessary pain and humiliation on \nprisoners housed at these four prisons.”  Doc. 481 at 1.  Plaintiffs name 22 supervisory and over \n400 non-supervisory Department employees as defendants. They obtained class certification as to \ntheir Eighth Amendment claims against the 22 supervisory defendants on that theory, and the \nSeventh Circuit affirmed, explaining that, on remand, the plaintiffs would be required to show that \nthe searches “were conducted pursuant to the uniform plan as they describe it and that those plans \nwere themselves unconstitutional.”  Ross v. Gossett, 33 F.4th 433, 442 (7th Cir. 2022). \nAfter seven years of discovery, including almost 100 depositions, plaintiffs have identified \nno evidence of a uniform plan to violate inmates’ rights—no single document, no statement from \nany defendant, nothing except plaintiffs’ own statements that they recall certain conduct occurred \nin a way they maintain was consistent across these four facilities.  The argument is badly flawed \n1 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 8 of 65   Page ID #22127\n \nand cannot justify sending plaintiffs’ claims to a jury.  Defendants hereby move for summary \njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. \nSTATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS1 \nA.  The Department’s Search Policies \n1.  This case concerns the constitutionality of facility-wide searches conducted in the \nspring and summer of 2014 at four IDOC correctional facilities: Menard, Illinois River, Big \nMuddy, and Lawrence Correctional Centers.  Doc. 197 (“Compl.”) at 29-35 (¶¶ 40-60). \n2.  Department staff search inmates’ cells at IDOC facilities regularly to ensure that \ninmates cannot hide contraband, including weapons and drugs.  Yurkovich Dep. Tr. 54:8-12, \n101:17-13, 105:2-106:9 (Def. Ex. A); Admin. Dir. 05.01.111 (Def. Ex. B); Expert Report of Larry \nReid (“Reid Rep.”) at 13-14 (¶¶ 15-16) (Def. Ex. C); D. White Dep. Tr. 71:5-72:7 (Def. Ex. D); \nsee also Sarver Decl. ¶ 2 (Def. Ex. ZZ). \n3.  Because cell-by-cell searches permit inmates to hand off contraband to one another \nwhen they realize such searches are impending, the Department also conducts facility-wide \nsearches, in which entire IDOC facilities or portions thereof are placed into lockdown while staff \nsearch every cell, one by one.  Gossett Dep. Tr. 45:19-48:14 (Def. Ex. E); Yurkovich Dep. Tr. \n93:13-94:16; 304:14-305:3 (Def. Ex. A); Reid Rep. 13-14 (¶¶ 15-16) (Def. Ex. C); Bordner Dep. \nTr. 28:3-29:11 (Def. Ex. F); Jennings Dep. Tr. 221:18-222:17 (Def. Ex. G).   \n4.  Contraband includes any unlawful substance in an inmate’s cell, including drugs, \nweapons, metal, any item that belongs to another inmate, and any item that has been altered from \nits original state.  Bordner Dep. Tr. 97:3-11 (Def. Ex. F). \n5.  Facility-wide searches serve multiple penological purposes.  Reid Rep. 13-14 \n \n1 These facts are undisputed by defendants for purposes of this summary judgment motion only. \n2 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 9 of 65   Page ID #22128\n \n(¶¶ 15-16) (Def. Ex. C); Yurkovich Dep. Tr. 304:14-305:3 (Def. Ex. A).   \n6.  Facility-wide searches are a more effective tool than cell-by-cell searches for \nlocating contraband (including weapons and drugs), because inmates cannot hand contraband to \none another during a facility-wide search.  Reid Rep. 13-14 (¶¶ 15-16) (Def. Ex. C); Yurkovich \nDep. Tr. 304:14-305:3 (Def. Ex. A).   \n7.  Facility-wide searches are also a useful tool for obtaining intelligence about gang \nactivity, both by locating evidence of gang associations left behind in cells and by interrogating \ninmates during lockdown periods.  Reid Rep. 13-14 (¶¶ 15-16) (Def. Ex. C); Jennings Dep. Tr. \n272:3-25 (Def. Ex. G); Yurkovich Dep. Tr. 94:11-16, 101:15-102:14 (Def. Ex. A).   \n8.  The purposes of facility-wide searches are achieved primarily by detaining inmates \nin a holding area while Department staff search the facilities on a cell-by-cell basis.  See Reid Rep. \n38 (¶ 55) (Def. Ex. C); Jennings Dep. Tr. 272:3-25 (Def. Ex. G); A. McAllister Dep. Tr. 231:7-10 \n(Def. Ex. H).   \n9.  It is a “common practice” across the United States to conduct facility-wide searches \nto “ensure that facilities are free from dangerous contraband and as safe as possible for inmates \nand staff.”  Reid Rep. 15-16 (¶ 18) (Def. Ex. C); Hurley Dep. Tr. 66:7-12, 67:1-3 (Def. Ex. WW).   \n10.  In Illinois, facility-wide searches are generally handled by an IDOC unit known as \nthe “tact team” (or tactical team).  Gossett Dep. Tr. 38:1-7, 45:19-48:14 (Def. Ex. E); D. White \nDep Tr. 35:20-36:1 (Def. Ex. D); Yurkovich Dep. Tr. 44:18-21 (Def. Ex. A).   \n11.  Tact team members are responsible for handling particularly complex situations \nwithin the Department, including riots, escapes, and forcible cell extractions.  Gossett Dep. Tr. \n38:1-7 (Def. Ex. E); Tact Manual Excerpts, Bates 14795 (Def. Ex. I); Sarver Dep. Tr. 35:11-36:12 \n3 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 10 of 65   Page ID #22129\n \n(Def. Ex. J); Yurkovich Dep. Tr. 43:11-45:4 (Def. Ex. A); see also Sarver Decl. ¶ 2 (Def. Ex. ZZ).2   \n12.  Tact team members are specifically selected for their ability to handle emergency \nsituations and are required to participate in additional training both at the outset of their service \nand on an ongoing basis.  Tact Manual Excerpts, Bates 14795-96 (Def. Ex. I); Gossett Dep. Tr. \n33:8-34:18 (Def. Ex. E); Yurkovich Dep. Tr. 43:11-19 (Def. Ex. A).   \n13.  The Department has developed and communicated policies and procedures to guide \nsearches at IDOC facilities, including facility-wide searches. Adams Dep. Tr. 18:6-19:3; 27:13-\n28:4; 28:18-30:5 (Def. Ex. K).   \n14.  For instance, during the period in question, Menard had a policy that dictated how \nofficers should conduct strip searches of inmates.  Menard Inst. Dir. 05.01.109 at 10 (Def. Ex. L); \nsee also Sarver Decl. ¶ 2 (Def. Ex. ZZ).   \n15.  Menard’s strip-search policy directs officers to conduct strip searches beginning \nwith an inmate’s head and proceeding downward to his feet and instructs them not to conduct strip \nsearches with members of the opposite gender present.  Menard Inst. Dir. 05.01.109 at 10-12 (Def. \nEx. L); Stark Dep. Tr. 39:17-20 (Def. Ex. M). \n16.  The Menard strip search policy mirrors the Department procedure more generally, \nin that the Department trains staff beginning at cadet training about how to conduct strip searches \nof inmates in the same manner as the Menard policy—i.e., officers conduct strip searches from the \n \n2  The  “tact  manual”  was  originally  produced  attorneys’-eyes-only  (“AEO”)  under  the \nconfidentiality order entered by the Court.  See Doc. 358.  Defendants have now agreed that certain \npages can be filed on the public docket, which are filed here as Defendants’ Exhibit I.  Similarly, \nalthough defendants initially produced the “operations orders” that governed the searches in this \ncase AEO, defendants now agree that the orders can be filed on the public docket; they are filed \nhere as Defendants’ Exhibits FF, GG, HH, II, and JJ.  Finally, consistent with their treatment of \nthese documents, defendants have filed unredacted deposition transcripts on the public docket, \ngiven that the only portions of those transcripts that were designated AEO were so designated \nbecause they discussed documents that have now been filed on the public docket in relevant part. \n4 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 11 of 65   Page ID #22130\n \nhead to the feet.  D. White Dep. Tr. 136:13-137:10 (Def. Ex. D); Yurkovich Dep. Tr. 149:24-\n150:13, 304:7-13 (Def. Ex. A); A. McAllister Dep. Tr. 150:22-151:12, 344:4-19 (Def. Ex. H); \nGilreath Dep. Tr. 169:4-9 (Def. Ex. N) ; Jennings Dep. Tr. 229:5-230:16, 231:20-23, 234:13-18, \n235:1-12 (Def. Ex. G); Adams Dep. Tr. 19:13-19; 45:15-20 (Dep. Ex. K); C. White Dep. Tr. 86:6-\n87:23 (Def. Ex. O); Finney Dep. Tr. 93:8-95:10 (Def. Ex. P).   \n17.  The Department does not permit female officers to be present during strip searches \nof male inmates (and vice versa), absent an emergency.   Menard Inst. Dir. 05.01.109 at 10 (Def. \nEx. L); Bordner Dep. Tr. 63:20-64:16 (Def. Ex. F); Butler Dep. Tr. 65:8-17 (Def. Ex. Q); Arnett \nDep. Tr. 70:6-12 (Def. Ex. R); Duncan Dep. Tr. 74:19-75:19 (Def. Ex. S). \n18.  When circumstances require that inmates be moved in large numbers, Department \npolicy requires officers to move inmates in pairs, with their heads down, and in a tight formation.  \nJones Dep. Tr. 103:9-15 (Def. Ex. T); Yurkovich Dep. Tr. 272:4-17 (Def. Ex. A); Bordner Dep. \nTr. 69:14-19, 70:13-71:2 (Def. Ex. F); Butler Dep. Tr. 67:17-68:6 (Def. Ex. Q).   \n19.  The Department’s movement policy ensures the safety of both the inmates and \nDepartment staff:  It ensures that inmates are looking at the ground in front of them while also \nminimizing the overall size of the group of inmates, thus maximizing IDOC officers’ ability to \ncontrol line movement.  Reid Rep. 34-36 (¶¶ 51-53) (Def. Ex. C); Bordner Dep. Tr. 71:20-72:2, \n73:12-18 (Def. Ex. F).  \n20.  Requiring  individuals  to  keep  their  heads  down  also  creates  a  more  secure \nenvironment by making it more difficult for inmates to communicate with each other and to assault \neach other (if, for instance, one believes another was the “snitch” that precipitated the search).  \nAtchison Dep. Tr. 126:8-16, 127:8-14 (Def. Ex. U); Bordner Dep. Tr. 79:4-80:8 (Def. Ex. F); \nYurkovich Dep. Tr. 272:9-17 (Def. Ex. A). \n5 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 12 of 65   Page ID #22131\n \n21.  During facility-wide searches, the Department’s general policy is to handcuff \ninmates during movements with their hands behind their back, palms facing out.  Yurkovich Dep. \nTr. 302:14-20 (Def. Ex. A); Gossett Dep. Tr. 55:14-16, 56:16-17 (Def. Ex. E); Gilreath Dep. Tr. \n170:15-21, 171:4-7 (Def. Ex. N); Bailey Dep. Tr. 301:3-17 (Def. Ex. V); Bordner Dep. Tr. 78:23-\n25 (Def. Ex. F); A. McAllister Dep. Tr. 247:2-7 (Def. Ex. H); C. White Dep. Tr. 126:8-10 (Def. \nEx. O); Jones Dep. Tr. 107:17-108:13 (Def. Ex. T).   \n22.  Handcuffing inmates during movement serves the penological goal of preventing \ninmates from assaulting staff or one another.  Bordner Dep. Tr. 79:4-80:8 (Def. Ex. F).   \n23.  The Department’s method also maximizes the safety of inmates and IDOC staff, \nincluding by making inmates’ palms visible to staff and preventing them from securing contraband \nin their hands during movements.  Reid Rep. 36-38 (¶ 54) (Def. Ex. C).  \n24.  Inmates with documented medical issues can obtain and present a “cuffing permit” \nto have their restraints applied in a different manner, including during a facility-wide search.  Id.; \nStark Dep. Tr. 86:7-18 (Def. Ex. M); Sarver Dep. Tr. 124:22-125:2 (Def. Ex. J); Atchison Dep. \nTr. 130:20-22 (Def. Ex. U); Bordner Dep. Tr. 112:2-18 (Def. Ex. F); Yurkovich Dep. Tr. 263:21-\n264:1 (Def. Ex.

X). \n25.  The Department’s handcuffing policy is a “generally accepted practice[]” that \n“increases the safety of all staff and inmates” by making inmates’ palms visible to officers and \npreventing them from securing contraband in their hands during movements.   Reid Rep. 36-38 \n(¶ 54) (Def. Ex. C); see also Sarver Dep. Tr. 124:3-125:2; 134:1-137:21 (Def. Ex. J). \n26.  The Department’s policy regarding cell searches includes a visual sweep, followed \n6 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 13 of 65   Page ID #22132\n \nby a close inspection of the cell fixtures, including plumbing, walls, ceiling, floor, windows, \nshelving, desks, drawers, and hot air registers, ventilation grills, and radiators.  Bordner Dep. Tr. \n92:5-94:18 (Def. Ex. F).   \n27.  The Department’s policy regarding cell searches also requires an in-depth search \nof all inmate property within the cell, including all clothing, toiletries, mattresses and bedding, \nbooks, and electronics.  Bordner Dep. Tr. 92:5-94:18 (Def. Ex. F).    \n28.  Department policy requires each tactical team member to complete a “shakedown \nslip” for any cell he or she searches.  Atchison Dep. Tr. 89:13-15 (Def. Ex. U); A. McAllister Dep. \nTr. 169:9-19 (Def. Ex. H); Hermetz Dep. Tr. 127:13-17 (Def. Ex. W); Finney Dep. Tr. 148:7-10 \n(Def. Ex. P); Gossett Dep. Tr. 187:5-8 (Def. Ex.

If any property is confiscated in the search, that property is documented on the \nshakedown slip.  Sarver Dep. Tr. 103:23-104:2 (Def. Ex. J); D. White Dep. Tr. 96:1-97:24 (Def. \nEx. D); Bordner Dep. 45:17-46:7; 96:10-18 (Def. Ex. F).   \n30.  Confiscation of property is permitted only with good cause.  See Stark Dep. Tr. \n69:21-70:2; 71:1-10. (Def. Ex. M); Schuler Dep. Tr. 11:20-25. (Def. Ex. Z). \n31.  As a general matter, facility-wide searches are expected to occur pursuant to these \npolicies and procedures. Yurkovich Dep. Tr. 140:3-19, 149:12-150:13, 153:3-18, 159:18-160:4, \n304:7-13 (Def. Ex. A).   \n32.  The manual for tact teams expressly requires tact teams to conduct strip searches \nfrom inmates’ head to their legs and move inmates in pairs and handcuffed behind the back.  Tact \nManual Excerpts, Bates 14756-57 (Def. Ex. I).   \n7 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 14 of 65   Page ID #22133\n \n33.  The Department regularly trains both officers and executives (including wardens \nand assistant wardens) on how to conduct handcuffing, line movement, cell searches, and strip \nsearches and how to supervise others in doing so, including during large shakedowns like the \nfacility-wide searches at issue here.  Adams Dep. Tr. 45:21-46:25; 49:8-17 (Def. Ex. K). \nB.  The 2014 Searches  \n34.  In the spring of 2014, the Department initiated a series of facility-wide searches at \nmultiple Department facilities statewide to search for and eliminate contraband.  D. White Dep. \nTr. 71:5-16, 73:3-77:11 (Def. Ex. D); Yurkovich Dep. Tr. 98:15-99:2, 100:18-21, 101:17-102:14, \n103:12-22 (Def. Ex. A); Brady Dep. Tr. 26:2-6 (Def. Ex. AA); A. McAllister Dep. Tr. 117:8-11, \n256:15-17 (Def. Ex. H); Arnett Dep. Tr. 32:10-12 (Def. Ex. R).   \n35.  This case concerns the facility-wide searches that occurred at only four of these \nfacilities: Menard, Illinois River, Big Muddy, and Lawrence Correctional Centers.  Compl. 29-35 \n(¶¶ 40-60).   \n36.  There  were  approximately  9,871  men  housed  in  these  facilities  during  the \ntimeframes at issue: 3,835 at Menard, 1,929 at Illinois River, 1,836 at Big Muddy, and 2,271 at \nLawrence.  See Menard Inmate List (Def. Ex. BB); Illinois River Inmate List (Def. Ex. CC); Big \nMuddy Inmate List (Def. Ex. DD); Lawrence Inmate List (Def. Ex. EE); see also Sarver Decl. ¶ 3 \n(Def. Ex. ZZ). \n37.  The facility-wide searches occurred pursuant to operations orders prepared by the \nstatewide tact team commander, defendant David White, and approved by the Department’s chief \nof operations, defendant Joseph Yurkovich.  See D. White Dep. Tr. 70:1-5, 78:7-79:6 (Def. Ex. \nD); Jones Dep. Tr. 43:21-44:2 (Def. Ex. T); Yurkovich Dep. Tr. 106:12-107:16 (Def. Ex. A); \nMenard Apr. 2 Ops. Order (Def. Ex.

The searches were conducted using tact team members from multiple facilities to \nensure they were completed as quickly as possible and to prohibit the movement of contraband \namong cells. Atchison Dep. Tr. 31:14-32:2; 32:20-22; 33:1-5. (Def. Ex. U) Bordner Dep. Tr. \n30:19-31:4, 34:17-35:10 (Def. Ex. F); Yurkovich Dep. Tr. 55:4-56:10 (Def. Ex. A); Moore Dep. \nTr. 85:18-86:11 (Def. Ex. KK).   \n39.  During the operation, tact team members would report to the regional tact team \ncommanders and the statewide commander, not the assistant wardens or warden at the facility.  \nBordner Dep. Tr. 40:4-41:5 (Def. Ex. F).  \n40.  The operations orders required the tact teams to execute the searches consistently \nacross facilities.  See Menard Apr. 2 Ops. Order (Def. Ex. FF); Menard Apr. 4-15 Ops. Orders \n(Def. Ex. GG); Illinois River Ops. Order (Def. Ex. HH); Big Muddy Ops. Order (Def. Ex. II); \nLawrence Ops. Order (Def. Ex. KK); Yurkovich Dep. Tr. 139:21-140:22, 201:4-11 (Def. Ex. A).   \n41.  Officers generally began the searches by entering the inmates’ living area quickly \nand noisily, including by banging batons on railings, to alert the inmates and put them on notice \nthat a search was going to occur.  D. White Dep. Tr. 141:4-20 (Def. Ex. D) Atchison Dep. Tr. \n123:15-17 (Def. Ex. U); Jennings Dep. Tr. 239:6-240:20 (Def. Ex. G); C. White Dep. Tr. 91:22-\n92:7 (Def. Ex. O).   \n42.  Entering living areas quickly and in a noisy manner can surprise inmates, which \nprevents them from destroying or hiding contraband.  See Jennings Dep. Tr. 239:6-21 (Def. Ex. \nG); A. McAllister Dep. Tr. 206:15-207:8 (Def. Ex. H); Reid Rep. 38-39 (¶ 57) (Def. Ex. C).   \n43.  Officers strip searched inmates individually in their cells, proceeding from head to \ntoe, according to Department policy.  See Stark Dep. Tr. 36:17-37; 38:5-11 (Def. Ex. M); Sarver \n9 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 16 of 65   Page ID #22135\n \nDep. Tr. 122:7-123:17 (Def. Ex. J); Bordner Dep. Tr. 54:12-14; 55:12-57:23; 61:2-6 (Def. Ex. F); \nC. White Dep. Tr. 86:6-87:23 (Def. Ex. O); Eovaldi Dep. Tr. 54:12-56:20 (Def. Ex. LL); T. \nMcAllister Dep. Tr. 69:5-18 (Def. Ex. MM). \n44.  Some officers instructed inmates to dress only in their blue Department uniforms, \nwithout donning socks or underwear.  Compare Edward Tenney Dep. Tr. at 36:10-16 (Def. Ex. \nNN) with Hermetz Dep. Tr. 75:22-76:7, 77:8-13 (Def. Ex. W); T. McAllister Dep. Tr. 127:15-\n128:15 (Def. Ex. MM).   \n45.  Inmates may hide contraband in socks and underwear, Reid Rep. 40-41 (¶ 60) (Def. \nEx. C), and directing inmates to leave these items in the cells allows officers to search them more \nthoroughly as part of the search of the cells rather than as part of the strip search (during which \ntime inmates are present and officers’ attention is devoted in part to ensuring the cells are secure), \nSarver Dep. Tr. 120:17-122:6 (Def. Ex. J).   \n46.  Requiring inmates to dress only in uniforms, without socks or underwear, thus has \nthe effect of deterring inmates from hiding contraband in socks or underwear in the first place.  \nReid Rep. 40-41 (¶ 60) (Def. Ex. C). \n47.  Officers then escorted inmates to waiting areas in pairs, walking in close formation, \nwith their heads down, and handcuffed in the back with their palms facing out and thumbs up, \nconsistent with Department policy.  See D. White Dep. Tr. 82:16-83:24 (Def. Ex. D); Stark Dep. \nTr. 48:3-21, 54:11-18, 57:4-17, 81:20-25, 83:20-23. (Def. Ex. M); Sarver Dep. Tr. 134:1-135:22 \n(Def. Ex. J); Bordner Dep.

Inmates then remained in the waiting area while the tact teams searched every cell \nbefore being returned to their cells.  See D. White Dep. Tr. 90:19-92:1 (Def. Ex. D); Stark Dep. \n10 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 17 of 65   Page ID #22136\n \nTr. 24:18-22 (Def. Ex. M); Bordner Dep. Tr. 105:1-106:1 (Def. Ex. F); A. McAllister Dep. Tr. \n241:11-18 (Def. Ex. H); Dorethy Dep. Tr. 69:6-9 (Def. Ex. X). \n49.  The wardens of the respective facilities sent Yurkovich summaries of the searches \nafter they were completed.  See May 24, 2014 E-Mail From Yurkovich (Def. Ex OO); July 11, \n2014 E-Mail From Duncan (Def. Ex. PP); Yurkovich Dep. Tr. 128:14-129:23 (Def. Ex. A); see \nalso Sarver Decl. ¶¶ 6-7 (Def. Ex. ZZ). \n50.  The summaries identify “no major issues” with the searches, with contraband \nreported confiscated at multiple facilities.  May 24, 2014 E-Mail From Yurkovich (Def. Ex OO); \nJuly 11, 2014 E-Mail From Duncan (Def. Ex. PP); see also D. White Dep. Tr. 58:10-59:9 (Def. \nEx. D) (tact teams found “a lot of knives” at Menard); Yurkovich Dep. Tr. 184:7-12, 184:23-\n185:18 (Def. Ex. A) (contraband found included “a lot of weapons”). \n51.  Following the four facility-wide searches in question, approximately 258 out of \nalmost 10,000 inmates, or roughly 2.6% of the inmate population, submitted grievances regarding \nthe searches.  Reid Rep. 23 (¶ 31) (Def. Ex. C).   \n52.  Over 70% of those grievances concerned allegations of missing property, and fewer \nthan  50  (less  than  0.5%  of  the  prisons’  populations)  alleged  that  any  of  plaintiffs’ central \ncomplaints—including “reverse” strip searches, contact between inmates’ genitals and other \ninmates’ bodies while moving to holding areas, and the like—occurred.  Id.   \n53.  Specifically, only three of nearly 10,000 inmates submitted grievances claiming \nthey had had a cuffing permit that was not honored.  Reid Rep. 23 (¶ 32) (Def. Ex. C).   \n54.  Only 18 of nearly 10,000 inmates submitted grievances claiming they experienced \na reverse strip search, and two-thirds of those arose from one facility (Illinois River).  Id. at 23-24 \n(¶¶ 32, 34).  \n11 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 18 of 65   Page ID #22137\n \n55.  Only 16 of nearly 10,000 inmates submitted grievances claiming they were forced \nto walk so closely to their fellow inmates that their genitals touched, and over half of those arose \nfrom one facility (Menard).  Id. at 24 (¶ 34).  \n56.  Only 11 of nearly 10,000 inmates (almost all at Big Muddy) submitted grievances \nalleging female officers had been present at their strip searches.  Id.  \nC.  The Supervisory Defendants and Their Roles in the Searches \nThe Statewide Supervisors \n57.  Defendant  Salvador  Godinez  was  the  Department’s  director  in  2014,  with \nadministrative oversight over more than 11,000 employees at nearly 30 IDOC facilities housing \nover 50,000 inmates. Godinez Dep. Tr. 17:10-18:12, 24:10-22 (Def. Ex. QQ).  \n58.  Godinez neither planned nor was present for the facility-wide searches that are the \nsubject of this action and does not “know what the operation plan was.”  Id. 35:20-37:8, 80:20-21. \n59.  Godinez  did  not  participate  in  planning  the  searches,  and  did  not  develop, \ncommunicate, or take part in developing or communicating any clandestine uniform plan that \nwould have required officers to deviate from Department policies in the ways plaintiffs allege \noccurred (including “reverse” strip searches, contact between inmates’ genitals and other inmates’ \nbodies, and the like).  See generally id. \n60.  Defendant Joseph Yurkovich was the Department’s chief of operations in 2014, \nwith operational responsibilities over the entire prison system. Yurkovich Dep. Tr. 34:23-35:3, \n58:13-59:3 (Def. Ex. A).   \n61.  Sometime after June 2013, Yurkovich began planning facility-wide searches at \nfacilities across the State, the purpose of which was to find “weapons or drugs” and to gather \nintelligence.  Id. 101:17-102:13, 105:2-106:9.   \n62.  Department  statewide  and  regional  tactical  commanders  worked  with  facility \n12 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 19 of 65   Page ID #22138\n \nwardens to draft operations orders for the searches.  Id. 106:12-107:16.   \n63.  Draft orders for each of the four facilities were reviewed by the Department’s \noperations deputy director and deputy chief, then approved by Yurkovich.  Id. 106:12-107:16.   \n64.  The “guiding principles . . . approaches . . . polices . . . [and] instructions . . . [listed \nin the operations orders] stayed the same throughout the initiative.”  Yurkovich Dep. Tr. 139:21-\n140:22.   \n65.  Yurkovich  did  not  develop,  communicate,  or  take  part  in  developing  or \ncommunicating, any clandestine uniform plan that would have required officers to deviate from \nDepartment policies in the ways plaintiffs allege occurred.  See generally id. \n66.  Defendant Michael Atchison was the Department’s deputy chief of operations in \n2014.  Atchison Dep. Tr. 45:11-13 (Def. Ex. U).   \n67.  Atchison supervised deputy directors of the three Department regions, each of \nwhich contained eight to ten facilities; he also supervised ancillary Department units that were \noperational in nature.  Id. 38:17-22.   \n68.  The facility-wide searches at issue were “under [Atchison’s] supervision at a high \nlevel.”  Id. 49:9-23.   \n69.  Atchison would receive reports of “significant incidents” that occurred during the \noperations.  Id.  \n70.  In terms of planning, operations orders for the searches drafted by Department \ntactical commanders were delivered to Atchinson, and then to the chief of operations, for approval.  \nId. 54:3-7, 55:4-16.   \n71.  Atchison has no memory of attending any of the four searches at issue.  Id. 76:11-\n14.   \n13 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 20 of 65   Page ID #22139\n \n72.  Atchison  did  not  develop,  communicate,  or  take  part  in  developing  or \ncommunicating, any clandestine uniform plan that would have required officers to deviate from \nDepartment policies in the ways plaintiffs allege occurred.  See generally id. \n73.  Defendant David White was the Department’s statewide tactical commander in \n2014.  D. White Dep Tr. 24:13-23 (Def. Ex. D).   \n74.  White assisted in overseeing the Department’s training academy and oversaw the \nDepartment’s statewide firearms and tactical operations.  Id. 29:11-17.   \n75.  White  supervised  at  least  50  facility-wide  searches  as  the  statewide  tactical \ncommander.  Id. 35:20-36:1.   \n76.  In late 2013 or early 2014, White was told by the chief of operations that the \nDepartment was going to “start doing statewide facility shakedowns to rid the institutions of \ncontraband,” including “weapons, toxins, [and] excess property.”  Id. 71:5-72:7.   \n77.  Working  with  regional  tactical  commanders,  White  was  to  formulate  draft \noperations orders “to meet the[se] goals.”  Id. 74:13-75:20.   \n78.  White drafted the operations orders (see id. 82:1-15,120:3-6) and attended at least \none day of searches at each of the facilities at issue (id. 33:23-34:11).   \n79.  For the operations White attended, he (along with the facility warden) first met with \nthe facility tactical leadership, and then with the entire tactical team, to discuss the day’s expected \n“chain of events,” after which the operations began.  Id. 36:23-37:24.   \n80.  White then observed and supervised the various search stages; the operations \nconcluded with a tactical leadership debriefing.  Id. 41:11-50:2.   \n81.  White did not develop, communicate, or take part in developing or communicating, \nany clandestine uniform plan that would have required officers to deviate from Department \n14 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 21 of 65   Page ID #22140\n \npolicies in the ways plaintiffs allege occurred.  See generally id. \n82.  Defendant Anthony McAllister was the tactical commander for the Department’s \nsouthern  region  in  2014,  responsible  for  planning  statewide  tactical  operations  there.    A. \nMcAllister Dep. Tr. 7:20-21, 37:17-21, 54:19-22 (Def. Ex. H).   \n83.  McAllister participated in drafting operations orders for the facility-wide searches \nat issue.  See id. 258:14-259:5, 264:15-19.   \n84.  After an operations order was approved, McAllister contacted the facility warden \nand tactical team leaders to advise them of the operation, and to direct the tactical leaders to assign \nteam members to the operation.  Id. 132: 5-20.   \n85.  McAllister participated in some of the searches.  Id. 187:24-190:6, 253:11-21, \n258:14-21.   \n86.  When McAllister was the most senior statewide tactical leader present at a facility-\nwide search, he first gathered all tactical commanders to review procedures for the search and then \nmet with the full tactical team for that same purpose.  See id. 138:6-141:24, 190:14-21.   \n87.  Once the operations began, McAllister generally supervised search activities.  See \nid. 210:12-212:19, 240:2-241:8, 248:23-250:2.   \n88.  McAllister  did  not  develop,  communicate,  or  take  part  in  developing  or \ncommunicating, any clandestine uniform plan that would have required officers to deviate from \nDepartment policies in the ways plaintiffs allege occurred.  See generally id. \nThe Big Muddy Supervisors \n89.  Defendant Zack Roeckeman was the Big Muddy warden in 2014, responsible for \nthe “overall supervision of the facility, including all safety and security” and the “supervision of \nstaff.”  Roeckeman Dep. Tr. 12:13-16, 25:16-22 (Def. Ex. RR).   \n15 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 22 of 65   Page ID #22141\n \n90.  Roeckeman was not involved in deciding to conduct a facility-wide search at Big \nMuddy but did help draft the operations order for the search.  Id. 30:6-12, 35:9-23.   \n91.  Roeckeman was present for the first day of the operation to welcome the tactical \nteam, thanking them in their effort to “help us make the facility safer.”  Id. 32:8-33:14.   \n92.  During the search week, Roeckeman “stopped by just to check how things were \ngoing from time to time.”  Id. 47:19-24.   \n93.  Roeckeman  did  not  develop,  communicate,  or  take  part  in  developing  or \ncommunicating, any clandestine uniform plan that would have required officers to deviate from \nDepartment policies in the ways plaintiffs allege occurred.  See generally id. \n94.  Defendant Robert Craig was the Big Muddy assistant warden of operations in 2014, \nresponsible for “the day-to-day operations and the staff . . . of the facility.”  Craig Dep. Tr. 22:22-\n23:6 (Def. Ex. SS).   \n95.  Craig had no role in deciding to conduct a facility-wide search at Big Muddy and \nno role in deciding the logistics of the search.  Id. 28:18-29:5.   \n96.  Craig did not speak to the tactical team members during their pre-search meetings; \nwhile the searches were taking place, he “went along with [his] regular daily responsibilities.”  Id. \n29:6-19, 31:23-32:4.   \n97.  Craig did not develop, communicate, or take part in developing or communicating, \nany clandestine uniform plan that would have required officers to deviate from Department \npolicies in the ways plaintiffs allege occurred.  See generally id. \n98.  Defendant David Hermetz was the Big Muddy tactical commander in 2014 and was \npresent for the Big Muddy and Menard facility-wide searches. Hermetz Dep.

Defendant Stephanie Dorethy was the Illinois River assistant warden of operations \nin 2014, overseeing “the operations of the facility, various departments like security, dietary, \nmaintenance.”  Dorethy Dep. Tr. 10:7-23, 26:10-17 (Def. Ex. X).   \n118.  For the facility-wide searches at issue, the tactical teams reported to the tactical \ncommander, who then addressed any “issues or concerns or questions” to the facility warden, \nassistant warden, or central regional commander.  Id. 51:10-19.   \n119.  During the operations, Dorethy did not stay with the tactical team, but was instead \n“intermingling throughout the facility,” “basically kind of check[ing] things out, mak[ing] sure \nthere’s no issues,” and then attending to her regular duties as assistant warden.  Id. 52:8-54:14.  \n120.

Plaintiffs are current and former inmates who were housed at the four facilities in \nquestion during the period in which the Department undertook facility-wide searches.  Doc. 519 \nat 12-13.   \n173.  Plaintiffs contend Department leaders “crafted a plan to conduct” facility-wide \nsearches “that were intended to inflict unnecessary pain and humiliation without any legitimate \n25 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 32 of 65   Page ID #22151\n \npenological justification, in violation of the Eighth Amendment.”  7th Cir. Doc. 38 (“7th Cir. Br.”) \nat 19-20. \n174.  Plaintiffs raise several specific complaints about the 2014 searches, including that \nthey were handcuffed in an unusually painful way; that they were made to wait for an unnecessarily \nlong period of time in holding areas (and in uncomfortable positions); that they were searched, \ncontrary to Department policy, in “reverse” order, such that they touched their genitals before \ntouching their mouths; and that officers physically and verbally harassed them during the searches.  \nId. at 7-10. \n175.  The supervisory defendants testified that the searches were conducted according to \nDepartment handcuffing policy, which requires the handcuffing of inmates behind their backs, \npalms out, with exceptions for those with “cuffing permits.”  A. McAllister Dep. Tr. 247:2-7 (Def. \nEx. H); Jones Dep. Tr. 107:17-108:13 (Def. Ex. T); see also Bordner Dep. Tr. 107:7-111:9 (Def. \nEx. F); Sarver Dep. Tr. 124:3-125:2; 134:1-137:21 (Def. Ex. J). \n176.  The supervisory defendants also agreed that inmates were required to wait in the \nholding areas only as long as it took to search the facilities cell-by-cell.  A. McAllister Dep. Tr. \n231:7-10 (Def. Ex. H); Dorethy Dep. Tr. 69:6-9 (Def. Ex. X); Piper Dep. Tr. 128:4-16 (Def. Ex. \nTT); Butler Dep. Tr. 83:5-9 (Def. Ex. Q).  \n177.  The supervisory defendants testified that the Department’s strip-search policy was \nto search inmates from head to toe, that cadets were taught how to conduct strip searches in this \nmanner from the beginning of their time at the Department, and that searches conducted in any \nother manner would have been contrary to Department policy.  D. White Dep. Tr. 136:13-139:1 \n(Def. Ex. D); Yurkovich Dep. Tr. 271:10-14 (Def. Ex. A); C. White Dep. Tr. 86:6-87:23 (Def. Ex. \nO); Finney Dep. Tr. 93:8-95:10 (Def. Ex. P); Gossett Dep.

No contemporaneous emails exist among the supervisory defendants discussing or \nacknowledging complaints of reverse strip searches.   \n179.  The supervisory defendants likewise testified that moving inmates in a manner that \nforced inmates’ genitals to touch the inmates in front of them would have been against Department \npolicy.  D.

The supervisory defendants testified that it would have been against Department \npolicy to physically or verbally harass inmates.  D. White Dep. Tr. 144:12-145:7 (Def. Ex. D); \nYurkovich Dep. Tr. 278:20-279:18 (Def. Ex. A); A. McAllister Dep. Tr. 235:12-236:18 (Def. Ex. \nH); see also Bordner Dep. Tr. 82:12-84:25; 114:17-115:5 (Def. Ex. F); Jennings Dep. Tr. 246:7-\n22 (Def. Ex.

As part of discovery in this case, all non-supervisory defendants were surveyed, \nand only one defendant who was present for the strip searches stated in surveys that he had seen \nor conducted a reverse strip search of an inmate.  See Splitek Decl. ¶¶ 7, 9 (Def. Ex. UU).3   \n182.  None of those defendants who were present for the facility-wide searches stated in \nsurveys that they had seen any officer use excessive force on an inmate.  Id. ¶ 6. \n183.  Photographs of the line movement taken during the 2014 search at Lawrence show \n \n3 This declaration is filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 1006 as a summary of voluminous \nwritings to prove the content of those writings. The original materials being summarized were \nproduced to plaintiffs. \n27 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 34 of 65   Page ID #22153\n \nthat the movement of inmates to the holding areas was generally consistent with Department \npolicy—that is, with inmates marching in a tight formation, but with no contact between inmates’ \ngenitals and the bodies of the inmates in front of them.  See July 2014 Lawrence Photographs (Def. \nEx. VV). \n184.  To the extent inmates may have walked or stood in closer formation at some points \nduring some movements than others, such variation simply reflects the dynamic nature of line \nmovement.  See Jennings Dep. Tr. 124:10-125:5 (Def. Ex. G). \n185.  Plaintiffs’ testimony reflects that inmates waited in a variety of locations (ranging \nfrom a gym to a chapel) in a variety of positions (some sitting, some standing) for a variety of time \nperiods (ranging from 20 minutes to several hours) during the searches.  See Doc. 481-30 at 67 \n(standing in chapel 30 to 60 minutes); Doc. 481-33 at  Doc. 491-7 at 103 (5:24-6:2, 6:15-18) \n(seated in cafeteria 30 to 40 minutes), 134 (8:8-17) (seated in cafeteria 35 to 45 minutes), 146 \n(11:3-5) (seated in cafeteria 30 minutes), 152 (9:13-15) (seated in cafeteria 30 minutes), 197 (6:2-\n4, 7:6-11) (seated in cafeteria 45 to 60 minutes), 212 (4:15-23) (seated in cafeteria 45 to 60 \nminutes); see 7th Cir.

Almost 40% of the inmates that defendants interviewed agreed the strip searches \nwere conducted in the same manner as all other strip searches, that is, from head to toe.

Although plaintiffs’ expert Daniel Pacholke objected to the Department’s policy of \nhandcuffing inmates behind their backs, he did so only on the ground that it can be inappropriate \nif applied “for a protracted period of time.”  Pacholke Rep. 26-27 (Def.

R. \n29 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 36 of 65   Page ID #22155\n \nCiv. P. 56(a); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  “Material facts” \nare those that “might affect the outcome of the suit,” and a dispute over “material fact” is “genuine” \nonly if “the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.”  \nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 248.  “If the evidence is merely colorable or is not sufficiently probative, \nsummary judgment should be granted.”  Walsh v. Dayemi Org., 608 F. Supp. 3d 715, 720 (S.D. \nIll. 2022).  In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must consider \nevidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  Lawrence v. Kenosha Cnty., 391 \nF.3d 837, 841 (7th Cir. 2004).  Summary judgment is “the put up or shut up moment in a lawsuit, \nwhen a party must show evidence it has that would convince a trier of fact to accept its version of \nthe events.”  Steen v. Myers, 486 F.3d 1017, 1022 (7th Cir. 2007). \nARGUMENT \nPlaintiffs told the Seventh Circuit three years ago that they would show on remand that the \n22 supervisory defendants against whom their class claims were certified “crafted a plan to conduct \nshakedowns that were intended to inflict unnecessary pain and humiliation without any legitimate \npenological justification, in violation of the Eighth Amendment.”  7th Cir. Br. 19-20.  After seven \nyears of discovery and almost 100 depositions, there is no evidence that such a plan ever existed.  \nInstead, the evidence establishes that the defendants undertook facility-wide searches in the spring \nof 2014 pursuant to Department policies that are grounded in legitimate penological interests.  To \nthe extent individual plaintiffs before the Court believe that they experienced deprivations of their \nconstitutional rights during those searches, those plaintiffs can and should bring those claims \nagainst the officers who injured them.  But plaintiffs cannot identify evidence that would permit a \nreasonable jury to credit their theory that the Department developed and implemented a uniform \nand clandestine plan to direct its officers to deviate from its established policies and procedures in \nthe ways that plaintiffs allege.   \n30 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 37 of 65   Page ID #22156\n \nDefendants’ motion proceeds as follows.  Section I seeks summary judgment on behalf of \nthe 22 supervisory defendants as to Counts I, II, and III for two independent reasons: (a) Plaintiffs \nhave not identified evidence of a “uniform plan” to violate their Eighth Amendment rights; and \n(b) not only is there no evidence of such a plan, there is likewise no evidence that each individual \nsupervisory defendant was personally involved in developing or executing such a plan.  Section II \nseeks summary judgment on behalf of all but nine of the non-supervisory defendants on the same \nclaims because there is no evidence connecting these individuals to any violation of any plaintiff’s \nrights.  Section III seeks summary judgment on behalf of these same defendants (and the Acting \nDirector of the Department in her official capacity) on plaintiffs’ claims in other respects, including \n(a) that their damages claims are barred by qualified immunity; (b) their official-capacity claim \nagainst the Director fails; and (c) their claim (in Count V) that defendants committed the state-law \ntort of intentional infliction of emotional distress (“IIED”) is barred by sovereign immunity and \nfails on the merits.  Finally, Section IV seeks (in the alternative) partial summary judgment as to \naspects of plaintiffs’ claims to guide and clarify the scope of any future proceedings.4 \nI.  Summary Judgment Is Proper As To The Supervisory Defendants On Plaintiffs’ \nEighth Amendment Claims.  \nThe Court should grant summary judgment to the 22 supervisory defendants on plaintiffs’ \nclasswide Eighth Amendment claims (Counts I, II, and III).  Plaintiffs’ primary claim is that the \nsupervisory defendants violated their Eighth Amendment rights by inflicting unnecessary and \ngratuitous pain during the facility-wide searches.  Compl. ¶¶ 68-79.5  Plaintiffs face a heavy burden \n \n4  The Court previously dismissed Count IV, Doc. 76 at 8, and the operative complaint re-alleges \nit for the sole purpose of preserving it for appeal, Compl. p. 43 n. 1.  Accordingly, this motion does \nnot address Count IV. \n5  Plaintiffs also allege that defendants engaged in a conspiracy to violate their constitutional rights, \nid. ¶¶ 80-87; and that defendants failed to intervene to prevent others from violating their rights, \n \n31 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 38 of 65   Page ID #22157\n \non that claim.  “The Eighth Amendment prohibits punishments which involve the unnecessary and \nwanton infliction of pain, are grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime for which an \ninmate was imprisoned, or are totally without penological justification.”  Whitman v. Nesic, 368 \nF.3d 931, 934 (7th Cir. 2004).  As the Seventh Circuit has explained, when an Eighth Amendment \nclaim turns on the constitutionality of a prison search, “only those searches that are ‘maliciously \nmotivated, unrelated to institutional security, and hence totally without penological justification’ \nare considered unconstitutional.”  Id. (quoting Meriweather v. Faulkner, 821 F.2d 408, 418 (7th \nCir. 1987)).  “In other words, the search must amount to ‘calculated harassment unrelated to prison \nneeds,’ with the intent to humiliate and inflict psychological pain.”  Id. (quoting Meriweather, 821 \nF.2d at 418) (citations omitted).  In an Eighth Amendment case, a plaintiff must show both that \nthe alleged constitutional deprivation is objectively severe and that the defendant subjectively \n“intended to deliberately harm” the plaintiff in permitting it to occur.  Id. at 934-35. \nPlaintiffs’ claims against the supervisory defendants require even more.  “[S]upervisors are \nnot vicariously liable for their subordinates’ misdeeds,” Haywood v. Hathaway, 842 F.3d 1026, \n1030 (7th Cir. 2016) (per curiam), and so plaintiffs must show that the supervisory defendants are \n“personally responsible for a deprivation of a constitutional right,” Stockton v. Milwaukee Cnty., \n44 F.4th 605, 619 (7th Cir. 2022).  As the Seventh Circuit explained, the plaintiffs are thus required \nto show that the supervisory defendants “designed and implemented” a uniform plan that was \n“planned to cause pain or humiliation with no penological justification.”  Ross, 33 F.4th at 441.  \n \nid. ¶¶ 88-93.  But all three claims are premised on the same underlying Eighth Amendment theory, \nas plaintiffs explained on appeal.  See 7th Cir. Br. 19-20 (explaining that all three claims shared \n“the contention that [defendants] crafted a plan to conduct shakedowns that were intended to inflict \nunnecessary pain and humiliation without any legitimate penological justification” and that the \nconspiracy and failure-to-intervene required plaintiffs to establish “additional” elements).  So if \nplaintiffs’ core Eighth Amendment claim (Count I) fails, their conspiracy and failure-to-intervene \nclaims (Counts II and III) likewise fail. \n32 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 39 of 65   Page ID #22158\n \nBut there is no evidence of such a plan in the record.  Instead, the record shows that the searches \nwere conducted pursuant to Department policies and procedures, which plaintiffs’ own experts \nconcede do not violate the Constitution.  No reasonable jury could conclude otherwise. \nSummary judgment is therefore appropriate as to the 22 supervisory defendants, on either \nof two grounds.  First, there is no evidence of a uniform plan—at all—to violate plaintiffs’ rights.  \nSecond, plaintiffs cannot show that each supervisory defendant “personally,” Stockton, 44 F.4th \nat 619, participated in the development or execution of any such plan.  The Court should grant \nsummary judgment to the supervisory defendants. \nA.  There Is No Evidence Of A Uniform Plan To Violate Plaintiffs’ Rights. \nPlaintiffs cannot meet their substantial burden because, even after years of discovery and \nalmost 100 depositions, there is no evidence of a clandestine uniform plan to violate plaintiffs’ \nrights.  Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claims against the supervisory defendants therefore “fail,” \nand the class must “be decertified.”  Bell v. PNC Bank, 800 F.3d 360, 379 (7th Cir. 2015). \n1.  The facility-wide searches, which were conducted pursuant to Department policy \nand procedure, did not violate plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment rights. \nThe record establishes that the 2014 facility-wide searches were conducted pursuant to \nDepartment policies, and that those policies are designed not to “cause pain or humiliation,” Ross, \n33 F.4th at 441, but to further the Department’s penological objectives.  No reasonable jury could \nconclude otherwise. \nThe record shows that the Department decided in 2014 to conduct facility-wide searches \nwith the goal of locating and confiscating contraband.  SMF 34.  It conducted those searches using \nspecially trained “tact team” members from multiple facilities to ensure searches were conducted \nas quickly as possible.  SMF 10, 38.  The plan for each search was set out in an operations order, \nand Department officers were expected to follow the operations order as well as Department \n33 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 40 of 65   Page ID #22159\n \npolicies and procedures.  SMF 31, 37, 40.  Officers generally began the searches by entering the \ninmates’ living area loudly, including by banging batons on cell bars, to surprise the inmates.  SMF \n41.  Officers strip searched inmates in their cells, proceeding from head to toe, according to \nDepartment policy.  SMF 43.  Officers then escorted inmates to a waiting area in pairs, walking in \nclose formation, with their heads down, and handcuffed in the back with their palms facing out—\nagain, all consistent with Department policy.  SMF 47.  Inmates then remained in the waiting area \nwhile the tact teams conducted a thorough search of every cell before being returned to their cells.  \nSMF 48. \n  No reasonable jury could conclude that the searches described above were designed “with \nthe intent to humiliate and inflict psychological pain.”  Whitman, 368 F.3d at 934.  To start, there \nis no serious question that the basic framework for the searches, as set out in the operations orders, \ndid not violate plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.  As defendants’ expert Larry Reid explained, it is a \n“common practice” across the United States to conduct facility-wide searches to “ensure that \nfacilities are free from dangerous contraband and as safe as possible for inmates and staff.”  Reid \nRep. 15-16 (¶ 18) (Def. Ex. C); see SMF 9.  To conduct such searches, correctional officers must \ndo exactly what the Department did in 2014: strip search each inmate (to ensure that he is not \nhiding contraband on his person), move all inmates to a separate holding location, search each cell \none by one (to ensure there is no contraband in the cell), and then return the inmates to their cells.  \nSuch searches are plainly designed to further the “penological justification” of identifying and \nsecuring contraband, rather than “to cause pain and humiliation.”  Ross, 33 F.4th at 441.  And they \nwere  successful:    Multiple  facilities  reported  finding  weapons  and  other  contraband  at  the \nconclusion of the searches.  SMF 50.  Even plaintiffs’ expert agreed that the policies for the \nfacility-wide searches, as set out in the operations orders, were “acceptable.”  SMF 191.  \n34 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 41 of 65   Page ID #22160\n \nIndeed, the Illinois federal courts have routinely rejected Eighth Amendment challenges to \nfacility-wide searches similar to those at issue here.  In September 2005, the Department conducted \na facility-wide search at Stateville Correctional Center, during which inmates were (as here) strip \nsearched, escorted to a holding area (there, an outdoor segregation yard) and held, handcuffed, for \nthree to five hours.  See Hernandez v. Battaglia, 673 F. Supp. 2d 673, 674-75 (N.D. Ill. 2009).  At \nleast three inmates challenged the constitutionality of that search in separate cases, but judges in \nthe Northern District rejected all those challenges, explaining that the searches were “not the kind \nof serious deprivations which would give rise to an Eighth Amendment violation.”  Id. at 676-77; \naccord Ames v. Stigler, 2009 WL 9097015, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 3, 2009); Curiel v. Stigler, 2008 \nWL 904894, at *8 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 31, 2008).  This Court reached the same conclusion two years \nago with respect to a case challenging facility-wide searches that took place at Menard only months \nafter those at issue here, holding that an individual who had been handcuffed, subjected to physical \nand verbal harassment, and held for a “significant period of time” in a holding area had not shown \na violation of his Eighth Amendment rights.  Chairs v. Ill. Dep’t of Corr’s, 2022 WL 3716170, at \n*2-3 (S.D. Ill. Aug. 29, 2022) (Yandle, J.).  These events, the Court explained, “could not \nreasonably be found to be sadistic, malicious, or repugnant.”  Id. at *3.  \nNothing about the policies governing the way these specific searches took place alters that \nbasic conclusion.  Again, to show that these policies violate the Eighth Amendment, plaintiffs must \nestablish that they have “no penological justification” and instead were implemented for the \npurpose of “caus[ing] pain or humiliation.”  Ross, 33 F.4th at 441.  Plaintiffs cannot make that \nshowing with respect to any aspect of the way the supervisory defendants planned and oversaw \nthe facility-wide searches at issue here.   \nFor instance, plaintiffs complain that the Department’s policy on restraining inmates—i.e., \n35 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 42 of 65   Page ID #22161\n \nto apply handcuffs to inmates with their hands behind their backs and their palms facing out—is \n“needlessly painful and uncomfortable.”  7th Cir. Br. 8.  But the Department’s handcuffing policy \nis a “generally accepted practice[]” that “increases the safety of all staff and inmates” by making \ninmates’ palms visible to officers and preventing them from securing contraband in their hands \nduring movements.   SMF 25.  It thus plainly has a “penological justification,” Ross, 33 F.4th at \n441, as even plaintiffs’ experts do not seriously dispute.  See Hurley Rep. 16-17 (Def. Ex. XX) \n(describing IDOC cuffing policies as “reasonable and generally accepted”); Pacholke Rep. 26-27 \n(Def. Ex. YY) (arguing only that palms-out cuffing is inappropriate if applied “for a protracted \nperiod of time”); see SMF 192-93.  Plaintiffs complain that palms-out cuffing is not comfortable, \nbut “routine discomfort” is an ordinary part of prison life, Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 9 \n(1992), and does not violate the Eighth Amendment.  Accord Perkins v. Pfister, 711 F. App’x 335, \n337 (7th Cir. 2017) (“We do not agree . . . that, as a matter of law, the Eighth Amendment would \nbe violated by a policy requiring inmates during periods of heightened security to navigate stairs \nwhile handcuffed behind the back.”). \nSome plaintiffs have asserted that their handcuffs were fastened more tightly than usual \nduring the facility-wide searches.  7th Cir. Br. 9-10.  But plaintiffs have identified no evidence    \nthat the supervisory defendants intentionally designed a plan to go above and beyond Department \npolicy and “gratuitous[ly] inflict[] . . . ‘wanton and unnecessary’ pain” on inmates, Hope v. Pelzer, \n536 U.S. 730, 738 (2002) (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 100 (1958)), by over-tightening \nhandcuffs during the 2014 searches.  Rather, the uniform testimony of the supervisory defendants \nwas  that  the  searches  were  conducted  according  to  Department  policy,  which  requires  the \nhandcuffing of inmates behind their backs, palms out, with exceptions for those with “cuffing \npermits.”  SMF 175.  Indeed, in the wake of the searches, only three inmates out of almost 10,000 \n36 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 43 of 65   Page ID #22162\n \nsubmitted grievances indicating that they had had a cuffing permit that was not honored.  SMF 53.  \nTo be sure, some of the class members (roughly 65) have provided individual declarations or \nstatements asserting that they believe their handcuffs were fastened too tightly.  7th Cir. Br. 9-10 \n& nn.4, 6.  But those statements attesting to individualized discomfort do not create a genuine \nquestion of material fact as to whether the supervisory defendants intentionally designed and \noversaw a plan to “deliberately harm” all inmates by ensuring that their handcuffs were tightened \ntoo tightly.  Whitman, 368 F.3d at 934-35.  And to the extent plaintiffs’ argument is that some of \nthem  individually  experienced  “wanton  and  unnecessary”  pain  during  the  time  they  were \nhandcuffed, Hope, 536 U.S. at 738, that argument cannot support the classwide claims against the \nsupervisory defendants, as the Seventh Circuit explained on appeal.  See Ross, 33 F.4th at 441-42 \n(plaintiffs’ claim against supervisory defendants was not that “handcuffs were too tight” as to \n“individual inmate[s]” but that “the plan unconstitutionally mandated the use of a particularly \npainful handcuff position that had no corresponding penological benefit”).  No rational jury could \nfind that the supervisory defendants developed and oversaw such a plan. \nPlaintiffs also complain that they were “forced to sit or stand handcuffed behind their backs \nfor a lengthy period while in the holding area.”  7th Cir. Br. 9.  But there is transparently a \npenological purpose in detaining inmates in a holding area while Department staff search the cells \n(to ensure the cells are clear for the search) and an equally obvious purpose in requiring inmates \nto remain handcuffed (to ensure the security of the holding area).  See SMF 8, 22.  And plaintiffs \nmount  no  serious  argument—and  the  record  contains  no  evidence—that  the  supervisory \ndefendants intentionally made inmates wait in the holding areas for longer than was necessary to \nsearch the cells to ensure the “unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.”  Whitman, 368 F.3d at \n934.  To the contrary, the supervisory defendants agreed that, consistent with Department policy, \n37 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 44 of 65   Page ID #22163\n \ninmates were required to wait in the holding areas only as long as it took to search the facilities \ncell-by-cell.  SMF 176.  And plaintiffs’ own testimony reflects that inmates waited in a variety of \nlocations (ranging from a gym to a chapel) in a variety of positions (some sitting, some standing) \nfor a variety of time periods (ranging from 20 minutes to four hours) during the searches.  SMF \n185.    Even  plaintiffs  have  conceded  that  the  record  reflects  that  inmates  had  “different” \nexperiences while waiting for the cell searches to conclude and that there was “variation” in the \ntime, place, and manner of their waits in the holding areas.  7th Cir. Br. 8-9.  There is simply no \nserious argument that the supervisory defendants violated plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment rights by \ndetaining them in holding areas in handcuffs while their cells were searched.  Indeed, every court \nto have considered similar claims regarding the Stateville searches reached the same conclusion \neven considering claims that inmates spent hours in waiting areas.  See Hernandez, 673 F. Supp. \n2d at 677; Ames, 2009 WL 9097015, at *3; Curiel, 2008 WL 904894. \nFinally, plaintiffs take issue with minor details, including that tact team officers made noise \nwhen entering inmates’ cells and that some instructed inmates to dress (after being strip searched) \nin prison uniforms only, without their socks or underwear.  7th Cir. Br. 7-8.  But these tertiary \naspects of the searches did not violate plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment rights, to the extent that they \noccurred, for multiple reasons.  For one, each had a penological purpose:  Entering inmates’ cells \nin a noisy manner can surprise the inmate population and prevent inmates from destroying or \nhiding contraband, SMF 42, and directing inmates to leave their socks and underwear in the cells \nwhile the cells are searched both allows officers to search those items more thoroughly and deters \ninmates from hiding contraband in them, SMF 45-46.  Nor did either practice impose the kind of \ndeprivation of privacy that could be described as “the denial of the minimal civilized measure of \nlife’s necessities,” as is necessary for an Eighth Amendment violation, Farmer v. Brennan, 511 \n38 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 45 of 65   Page ID #22164\n \nU.S. 825, 834 (1994).  To the contrary, courts have repeatedly and consistently held that neither \nnoise nor the temporary deprivation of underwear constitutes an Eighth Amendment violation, see \nLunsford v. Bennett, 17 F.3d 1574, 1580 (7th Cir. 1994) (noise); Spivey v. Doria, 1994 WL 97756, \nat *11 (N.D. Ill. March 24, 1994) (noise); O’Leary v. Iowa State Men’s Reformatory, 79 F.3d 82, \n83 (8th Cir. 1996) (underwear); Frazier v. Ill. Dep’t of Corr’s, 2023 WL 6276040, at *2 (S.D. Ill. \nSept. 26, 2023) (Beatty, M.J.) (clean underwear).  The same is true here. \nTo the extent plaintiffs’ view is that the conditions described above, although individually \nde minimis, can be somehow aggregated together to give rise to a single Eighth Amendment claim, \nthey are wrong.  Although “[s]ome conditions of confinement may establish an Eighth Amendment \nviolation ‘in combination’ when each would not do so alone,” that is the case only when otherwise \nde minimis conditions “have a mutually enforcing effect that produces the deprivation of a single, \nidentifiable human need such as food, warmth, or exercise—for example, a low cell temperature \nat night combined with a failure to issue blankets.”  Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 304-05 (1991) \n(quoting Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347 (1981)) (emphasis in original).  Plaintiffs’ claims \nare not of that sort:  They do not allege that the individual indignities they experienced somehow \nworked together to deprive them of some fundamental “human need,” nor could they realistically \ndo so.  Plaintiffs’ complaints about handcuffing, noise, and the like must therefore be evaluated on \ntheir own merits rather than as part and parcel of some overall “mutually reinforcing” plan.  See \nCuriel, 2008 WL 904894, at *4 (“address[ing] each of the plaintiff’s ostensible hardships in turn”).  \nIn the end, “the Constitution does not mandate comfortable prisons,” Rhodes, 452 U.S. at 349, and \nthe kind of minor deprivations that plaintiffs describe here do not rise to the level of an Eighth \nAmendment violation.  No reasonable jury could conclude otherwise.  \n2.  There is no evidence of a clandestine uniform plan to violate plaintiffs’ rights. \nPlaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claims rest largely on their allegation that the Department \n39 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 46 of 65   Page ID #22165\n \ndeveloped and executed a clandestine policy for conducting the facility-wide searches in a manner \nthat deviated widely from its established policies and practices and from the account set out above.  \nSee 7th Cir. Br. 7-10.  Plaintiffs allege the existence of a uniform plan to (a) conduct so-called \n“reverse” strip searches, requiring inmates to manipulate their genitals and buttocks before putting \ntheir hands in their mouths; and (b) force inmates to move to the holding area in such close \nformation that their genitals touched the inmates in front of them (which they say is referred to as \n“nuts to butts”).  Id.  Plaintiffs also identify various other complaints raised by individual inmates, \nincluding that some were pushed, shoved, and verbally harassed while moving to the holding area; \nthat there were female officers present during some strip searches; and that some inmates returned \nto their holding cells to find their property confiscated.  Id.; see also Doc. 481 at 18, 20.  But after \nyears of discovery and almost 100 depositions, plaintiffs have identified no evidence of a “uniform \nplan,” Ross, 33 F.4th at 440, requiring tact team members to deviate from Department policy in \nsuch a manner. \nPlaintiffs’ most eye-catching allegation is that tact team members conducted “reverse” strip \nsearches, requiring inmates to manipulate their genitals and buttocks before touching their mouths \nrather than vice versa.  7th Cir. Br. 7-8.  But no evidence in the record supports the claim that any \nsuch searches were the result of a uniform plan created and overseen by the supervisory defendants.  \nThe Menard strip search policy requires Department officers to conduct strip searches from top to \nbottom, beginning with an inmate’s hair and moving to his feet.  SMF 15.  And the supervisory \ndefendants testified that this was the Department’s policy, that cadets were taught how to conduct \nstrip searches in this manner from the beginning of their time at the Department, and that searches \nconducted in any other manner would have been contrary to Department policy.  SMF 16, 177.  \nOnly one of the over 400 non-supervisory defendants who were present during the searches stated \n40 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 47 of 65   Page ID #22166\n \nthat he searched inmates in the manner that plaintiffs describe or saw any other officer do so.  SMF \n181.  Years of discovery, in other words, have revealed no evidence of a public uniform plan to \nconduct reverse strip searches during the 2014 searches; instead, all defendants agree that such \nconduct would have been deeply contrary to policy and practice. \nPlaintiffs’ burden, then, is to establish that there was an unwritten and clandestine uniform \nplan, one that the supervisory defendants secretly developed, communicated, and ensured was \nexecuted in a uniform way—a plan to deviate profoundly from Department policy and procedure \nin a manner designed to “humiliate and inflict psychological pain.”  Whitman, 368 F.3d at 934.  \nPlaintiffs have identified no evidence that would create a genuine question of material fact on that \nissue.  Indeed, the only evidence that suggests any inmates experienced reverse strip searches in \n2014 is inmate testimony, but that testimony is fractured, not uniform, and contradicted by other \ncontemporaneous evidence.  At the class-certification stage, the parties presented testimony from \n111 inmates, only 59 of whom—barely over half—testified that they had experienced a reverse \nstrip search.  SMF 186.  More than 30% of the declarations that plaintiffs introduced are silent as \nto how any strip search was conducted, SMF 187, and almost 40% of the inmates that were \ninterviewed agreed that the strip searches were conducted in the normal manner, top to bottom, \nSMF 188.  Even if a jury were to credit this evidence, it at most could support the idea that some \ntact team members in some facilities deviated from Department policy, not that the supervisory \ndefendants devised and executed a secret plan to depart from that policy in the uniform manner \nthat plaintiffs describe. \nThat is especially so given that the contemporaneous evidence refutes plaintiffs’ reverse \nstrip search claim.  Only 18 inmates out of nearly 10,000—and only one of plaintiffs’ declarants—\nsubmitted post-search grievances claiming that they experienced a reverse strip search.  SMF 54.  \n41 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 48 of 65   Page ID #22167\n \nWere the practice widespread, common, or uniform, as plaintiffs now assert, hundreds of inmates \nwould presumably have filed grievances.  See Reid Rep. 25 (¶ 35) (Def. Ex. C) (inmates “would \nhave known that this claimed ‘reverse’ search deviated from normal procedures and would have \nmentioned that in their grievances”).  Two thirds of those complaints also arose from one facility—\nIllinois River—casting further doubt on the claim that any reverse strip searches were the result of \na uniform plan developed and overseen by the supervisory defendants, as opposed to the rogue \nactions of errant tact team members.  See id. at 24 (¶ 34).  And no contemporaneous emails exist \namong the defendants discussing or acknowledging complaints of reverse strip searches.  SMF \n178.  The lack of contemporaneous evidence supporting plaintiffs’ reverse strip search allegation \ndemonstrates, again, that (at most) some tact team members in some facilities deviated from \nDepartment policies, not that the supervisory defendants developed a “uniform plan,” Ross, 33 \nF.4th at 440, requiring tact team members conduct reverse strip searches for the specific goal of \n“humiliat[ing] and inflict[ing] psychological pain,” Whitman, 368 F.3d at 934.  No rational jury \ncould conclude otherwise. \nThe same is true of plaintiffs’ claim that the supervisory defendants developed and oversaw \na uniform plan to make inmates move to the holding area in such close formation that their genitals \ntouched the inmates in front of them (a formation they say is called “nuts to butts”).  7th Cir. Br. \n8-9.  Again, no record evidence supports that claim.  Although Department policy instructs officers \nto move inmates in pairs, with their heads down, and in a tight formation, in order to ensure the \nsafety of both inmates and Department staff, SMF 18-20, it does not permit officers to force \ninmates to walk so close to one another that their genitals touch other inmates; indeed, the \nsupervisory defendants agreed that intentionally moving inmates in this manner would have been \nagainst Department policy, SMF 179.  It is thus essentially undisputed that there was no public \n42 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 49 of 65   Page ID #22168\n \nuniform plan to have tact team members intentionally move inmates to the holding areas in a way \nthat would ensure their genitals touched the bodies of the inmates in front of them. \nAnd plaintiffs cannot prove, as they must, that there was a clandestine uniform plan to do \nso.  The inmate testimony cannot support that claim:  Although plaintiffs filed typed declarations \nin support of class certification containing descriptions of the alleged physical conduct that were \nessentially word-for-word identical, Doc. 481-51, only 16 inmates out of nearly 10,000 submitted \npost-search grievances alleging that they were required to walk so closely to their fellow inmates \nthat their genitals touched, and over half of those complaints came from inmates at Menard, SMF \n55.  Photographs of the line movement taken during the 2014 search at Lawrence, by contrast, \nshow that the movement of inmates to the holding areas was generally consistent with Department \npolicy, SMF 184—that is, with inmates marching in a tight formation, in order to ensure the safety \nof tact team members and inmates alike, but with no contact between inmates’ genitals and the \nbodies of the inmates in front of them.  There is no question of material fact about whether the \nsupervisory defendants developed and executed a clandestine plan to force inmates to press against \neach other in the way that plaintiffs describe. \nFinally, plaintiffs’ scattered claims that individual defendants engaged in other conduct \nthat they characterize as humiliating or demeaning cannot establish that there was a uniform policy \nto require tact team members to act in such a manner, as plaintiffs’ claims require.  For instance, \nplaintiffs allege that some tact team members pushed, shoved, and verbally harassed inmates while \nmoving them to the holding area, see 7th Cir. Br. 9, but there is no evidence that the supervisory \ndefendants established a plan or policy to that effect.  Instead, defendants uniformly agreed that it \nwould have been against Department policy to physically or verbally harass inmates, SMF 180; \nnone of the non-supervisory defendants who were present stated that they had witnessed the use \n43 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 50 of 65   Page ID #22169\n \nof excessive force, SMF 182; many of the consolidated plaintiffs said that they were not touched \nor shoved into other inmates during the line movement, SMF 189; and only five of the inmates \nwho executed declarations in support of plaintiffs’ class certification motion in fact submitted post-\nsearch grievances complaining that they had been shoved during line movement, SMF 190.  To \nthe extent that the inmates’ testimony gives rise to any question of material fact as to class \nmembers’ exposure to physical or verbal harassment that sounds in the Eighth Amendment, but \nsee Beal v. Foster, 803 F.3d 356, 358 (7th Cir. 2015) (“Simple or complex, most verbal harassment \nby jail or prison guards does not rise to the level of cruel and unusual punishment.”); DeWalt v. \nCarter, 224 F.3d 607, 720 (7th Cir. 2000) (“[N]ot every push or shove by a prison guard violates \na prisoner’s constitutional rights.”), it does not give rise to a question of material fact as to whether \nthe supervisory defendants intentionally developed and supervised the execution of a “uniform \nplan,” Ross, 33 F.4th at 440, to have tact team members physically or verbally harass inmates to \n“humiliate and inflict psychological pain,” Whitman, 368 F.3d at 934.  No reasonable jury could \nconclude otherwise. \nPlaintiffs’ scattered allegations that some inmates experienced other issues during the 2014 \nsearches fare no better.  One (but only one) of the class representatives testified, for instance, that \na female officer was present during his strip search, e.g., Doc. 481 at 20, and he and two others \ntestified that their personal property was taken during the searches of their cells, id. at 18, 20-21.  \nBut plaintiffs did not suggest in their class certification motion or on appeal that either the presence \nof female officers or the loss of property was uniformly experienced by the class, see id. at 10-14 \n(describing the allegedly “uniform” parts of the 2014 searches and not mentioning these); 7th Cir. \nBr. 7-10 (same), and for good reason:  There is no evidence that defendants established a uniform \nplan that would have required tact team officers to conduct strip searches with opposite-sex guards \n44 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 51 of 65   Page ID #22170\n \npresent or authorized those officers to take non-contraband property from inmate cells.  Indeed, \nDepartment policy does not permit opposite-sex officers to be present during strip searches, SMF \n17, and only 11 inmates out of almost 10,000 (almost all at Big Muddy) submitted grievances \nalleging  that  female  officers  had  been  present  at  their  strip  searches,  SMF  56.    Similarly, \nDepartment policy prohibits officers from taking property without good cause and requires officers \nto leave a so-called “shakedown slip” whenever a search is completed, including where property \nis taken.  SMF 28.  Although some inmates filed grievances attesting to the confiscation or loss of \nproperty, there is no evidence of any kind that the supervisory defendants developed or executed \na plan that would have authorized deviations from Department policy in that way for the purpose \nof humiliating inmates.  See Whitman, 368 F.3d at 934.  No reasonable jury could reach a contrary \nconclusion. \nB.  There Is No Evidence Each Supervisory Defendant Personally Participated In \nSuch A Plan. \nEven if there were evidence of some uniform plan to violate plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment \nrights, that would still not be enough for plaintiffs’ claims against each one of the 22 supervisory \ndefendants to go to a jury.  Plaintiffs cannot obtain a verdict against the supervisors en masse; \nrather, they must show that each supervisory defendant “personally,” Stockton, 44 F.4th at 619, \nparticipated in the development or execution of such a plan.  See Haywood, 842 F.3d at 1030 \n(supervisors “are liable for their own acts but not derivatively liable for other persons’ acts”).  And \nbecause it is plaintiffs’ ultimate burden to plead and prove their claims against the supervisory \ndefendants, it is likewise plaintiffs’ burden at this stage to show there is sufficient evidence in the \nrecord to survive summary judgment—that is, that there is evidence now that would permit a \nreasonable jury to rule in their favor, against each individual supervisory defendant, at trial.  See \nModrowski v. Pigatto, 712 F.3d 1166, 1168-69 (7th Cir. 2013); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. \n45 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 52 of 65   Page ID #22171\n \n317, 325 (1986).  Plaintiffs cannot make that showing, and so the Court should enter summary \njudgment for each supervisory defendant against whom plaintiffs have failed to establish a genuine \nquestion of material fact as to that defendant’s personal liability. \nAlthough it is plaintiffs’ burden to show that there is sufficient evidence for a rational jury \ncould rule against each individual defendant (not defendants’ burden to demonstrate a lack of such \nevidence), see Modrowski, 712 F.3d at 1168 (a movant need not “support its motion with affidavits \nor other similar materials negating [the nonmovant’s] claim” (emphasis omitted)), the evidence \namassed to date shows that plaintiffs cannot meet that burden.  See SMF 57-171.  For instance, \ndefendant Godinez did not plan the searches at issue here, was not present for them, and does not \neven “know what the operation plan was.”  SMF 57-59.  Many of these defendants had no \nsubstantive involvement with either the development of the search plans, their execution, or both:  \nDefendants Craig, Hermetz, Finney, and more did not participate in any way in planning the \nsearches, SMF 95, 99, 109-10, and Finney testified under oath that he had never even seen an \noperations order, SMF 109.  Multiple allegedly “supervisory” defendants testified that they were \nnot present for the execution of the searches or have no memory of participating in them.  See SMF \n96 (Craig performed “[his] regular daily responsibilities” during searches); SMF 119 (similar for \nDorethy); SMF 145 (Gilreath has no memory of participating in the searches); SMF 162 (same for \nJones).  On this record, plaintiffs cannot carry their burden of showing that each of the supervisory \ndefendants “personally,” Stockton, 44 F.4th at 619, participated in the development or execution \nof a uniform plan to deprive plaintiffs of their rights.  And even if plaintiffs could identify evidence \nthat could somehow give rise to a genuine question of material fact on whether some of the \nsupervisory defendants developed and executed such a plan, summary judgment in favor of the \nremaining supervisory defendants must nonetheless be granted. \n46 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 53 of 65   Page ID #22172\n \nMore broadly, there is no evidence that any individual supervisory defendant developed, \ncommunicated, or took part in developing or communicating, any clandestine uniform plan that \nwould have required Department officers to deviate from its policies in the ways plaintiffs allege \noccurred (including “reverse” strip searches, contact between inmates’ genitals and other inmates’ \nbodies, and the like).  SMF 57-171.  Plaintiffs’ burden is to establish not only that some plan of \nthis kind existed (which it did not, supra pp. 39-45); it is to establish that one or more of the \ndefendants against whom a class was certified “personally,” Stockton, 44 F.4th at 619, participated \nin its development or execution.  Plaintiffs cannot do so.  The class should therefore be decertified, \nBell, 800 F.3d at 379, and the named and consolidated plaintiffs’ claims should proceed, if at all, \nagainst those individual Department officers who allegedly violated their constitutional rights in \nthe spring and summer of 2014. \nII.  Summary Judgment Is Proper As To Most Of The Non-Supervisory Defendants On \nPlaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment Claims. \nAlthough the proceedings to date have focused primarily on the 22 supervisory defendants, \nplaintiffs also allege claims against over 400 non-supervisory defendants—individual tact team \nofficers who plaintiffs allege personally violated their Eighth Amendment rights by participating \nin the 2014 facility-wide searches.  Compl. ¶¶ 14-21.  But only nine of those defendants were ever \nnamed by any named or consolidated plaintiff as having personally engaged in any specific \nconduct that plaintiffs assert is unconstitutional.6  The remaining non-supervisory defendants \nhereby move for summary judgment on plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claims. \n \n6  These nine defendants—Bradley Clark, Steven Conrad, Justin Eckelberry, Jason Furlow, James \nGray, Marcus Jenkins, Brian Livingston, John Maragni, and Carson Winters—maintain that they \nacted constitutionally at all times, and will defend their conduct at trial if the relevant individual \nplaintiffs choose to proceed with their claims.  This section of the motion is brought on behalf of \nthe 432 remaining non-supervisory defendants. \n47 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 54 of 65   Page ID #22173\n \nTo be sure, these defendants participated in the 2014 facility-wide searches at one or more \nof the four facilities at issue here.  But that is not sufficient to establish these defendants’ individual \nliability; plaintiffs must identify evidence that each individual defendant “personally,” Stockton, \n44 F.4th at 619, violated an individual plaintiff’s Eighth Amendment rights.  The record evidence \nshows otherwise:  Almost every defendant who was present denied having conducted or seen any \n“reverse” strip searches and denied having seen any officer use excessive force, among other \nthings.  SMF 181-82.  Regardless, though, these defendants do not need to point to evidence \ndisproving their individual liability.  Rather, as the Seventh Circuit has explained, because it is \nplaintiffs who bear the burden of proving their claims at trial, once defendants “point out to the \ndistrict court . . . that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party’s case”—\nhere, the plaintiffs’ case—the burden shifts to the plaintiffs “to demonstrate that there is evidence \n‘upon which a jury could properly proceed to find a verdict’” in their favor.  Modrowski, 712 F.3d \nat 1168-69 (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 241).  Plaintiffs cannot make that showing with respect \nto each individual defendant, given the lack of evidence in the record connecting the movants to \nthe allegations made by the named and consolidated plaintiffs. Summary judgment in favor of the \n432 non-supervisory defendants other than those named above, supra p. 47 n.5, is required. \nIII.  Summary Judgment Is Required On Other Grounds. \nPlaintiffs’ claims fail for other reasons.  Plaintiffs have brought almost exclusively claims \nagainst defendants in their individual capacities, pursuant to which they can recover damages.  See, \ne.g., Compl. ¶ 38 (Godinez sued “in his individual capacity”); Miller v. Smith, 220 F.3d 491, 493-\n94 (7th Cir. 2000); Hill v. Shelander, 924 F.2d 1370, 1372-74 (7th Cir. 1991).  But those claims \nare barred by qualified immunity, irrespective of their merits.  And any official-capacity claims \nthat plaintiffs intend to bring against the Acting Director of the Department, Compl. ¶ 39, fail both \non the merits and on standing grounds.  Finally, plaintiffs’ state-law claim, Count V, is barred by \n48 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 55 of 65   Page ID #22174\n \nstate-law sovereign immunity and fails on the merits. \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Damages Claims Are Barred By Qualified Immunity. \nDefendants are, at minimum, entitled to qualified immunity against plaintiffs’ damages \nclaims.  The doctrine of qualified immunity “protects government officials from liability for civil \ndamages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional \nrights of which a reasonable person would have known.”  Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 \n(2009) (quotation marks omitted).  “[O]nce raised, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to defeat” a \nqualified immunity defense.  Leiser v. Kloth, 933 F.3d 696, 701 (7th Cir. 2019).  To do so, plaintiffs \nmust establish both that (a) the facts “show ‘a violation of a constitutional right’” and (b) “the \n‘constitutional right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.’”  Id. (quoting Gill \nv. City of Milwaukee, 850 F.3d 335, 340 (7th Cir. 2017)).  To make the latter showing, plaintiffs \nmust “show either a reasonably analogous case that has both articulated the right at issue and \napplied it to a factual circumstance similar to the one at hand or that the violation was so obvious \nthat a reasonable person necessarily would have recognized it as a violation of the law.”  Id.  In \nthe end, “‘[t]o be clearly established, a right must be sufficiently clear that every reasonable official \nwould have understood that what he is doing violates that right[,]” meaning that “‘existing \nprecedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.’”  Id. at 702 \n(quoting Reichle v. Howards, 566 U.S. 658, 664 (2012) (cleaned up)). \nPlaintiffs cannot show, at a minimum, that “existing precedent” placed the constitutionality \nof the searches “beyond debate.”  Reichle, 566 U.S. at 664.  As discussed, the policies pursuant to \nwhich these searches occurred—i.e., under which inmates were strip searched, handcuffed with \ntheir palms out, moved to secure areas, and returned after their cells were searched—are grounded \nin penological purposes and consistent with common practice across the United States.  Supra pp. \n33-39.  Plaintiffs can point to no precedent condemning facility-wide searches of this sort as a \n49 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 56 of 65   Page ID #22175\n \nviolation of the Eighth Amendment.  Indeed, as discussed, supra p. 34, district court opinions \narising out of facility-wide searches at Stateville Correctional Center (likewise conducted by the \nDepartment’s tact teams) in the mid-2000s uniformly rejected Eighth Amendment challenges to \nthose searches on the merits.  See Hernandez, 673 F. Supp. 2d at 676; Ames, 2009 WL 9097015, \nat *3; Curiel, 2008 WL 904894, at *8.  Thus, far from placing the constitutionality of the \nDepartment’s facility-wide search protocols “beyond debate,” Reichle, 566 U.S. at 664, existing \nprecedent  would  have  given  all  defendants  (supervisory  and  non-)  no  reason  to  doubt  the \nconstitutionality of searches conducted pursuant to those policies.  And even if the searches were \nconducted as plaintiffs say, supra pp. 39-40, it is still plaintiffs’ burden to establish that any \nconstitutional violations that occurred were obvious under “existing precedent,” such that “every \nreasonable official” would have understood that the searches violated plaintiffs’ rights.  Id.  \nPlaintiffs cannot meet that burden, and defendants are thus entitled to qualified immunity on their \nEighth Amendment claims. \nB.  Any Official-Capacity Claims Fail For Lack Of Standing And On The Merits. \nAlthough proceedings to date have focused on plaintiffs’ personal-capacity claims against \nthe supervisory and non-supervisory defendants who actually participated in the 2014 searches, in \ntheir amended complaint plaintiffs also pleaded official-capacity claims against the Director of the \nDepartment, presumably for the purpose of seeking injunctive relief.  See Compl. 29 (¶ 39); see \nalso id. at 40-41 (¶¶ 78, 86) (requesting “injunctive relief” as to Counts I and II).7  (The Director \nis immune from damages claims under the Eleventh Amendment.  Miller, 220 F.3d at 493-94; Hill, \n924 F.2d at 1372-74.)  To the extent plaintiffs continue to pursue these official-capacity claims, \n \n7  The current Acting Director of the Department, Latoya Hughes, is automatically substituted for \nformer director James Baldwin under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d). \n50 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 57 of 65   Page ID #22176\n \nthey fail for multiple reasons, including that plaintiffs lack standing to seek injunctive relief and \nthat the claims fail on the merits. \nFirst, plaintiffs lack standing to seek injunctive relief.  The Court certified the class as a \ndamages-only class under Rule 23(b)(3), Doc. 519 at 10, meaning that the only plaintiffs who have \nlive claims for injunctive relief are the named plaintiffs and those whose separate cases have been \nconsolidated with this one.  Those plaintiffs must show that there is a “real and immediate threat” \nthat they will again—personally—experience the conduct that they allege is unconstitutional.  See \nCity of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105 (1983); Stewart v. McGinnis, 5 F.3d 1031, 1037-\n38 (7th Cir. 1993).  They cannot do so.  Many—including named plaintiffs Ross, Hamilton, and \nVerser—are no longer incarcerated, and so plainly lack standing to seek injunctive relief, no matter \nhow their claims are styled.  See Stewart, 5 F.3d at 1038 (no standing where plaintiff “no longer” \nincarcerated at specific prison and so “under no immediate threat of harm from official conduct” \nthere).8  And the named and consolidated plaintiffs who remain incarcerated cannot show they are \nlikely to experience the conduct they claim is unconstitutional again.  That is certainly true with \nrespect to plaintiffs’ allegations of reverse strip searches, uncomfortably close line movement, and \nthe like—i.e., those aspects of plaintiffs’ claims that involve deviations from Department policy \nand practice, supra pp. 39-40.  As the Supreme Court held in Lyons, it is “incredible” to suggest \nthat a plaintiff personally faces an “immediate threat” from the prospect that public officials might \nintentionally “disobey their instructions” in such a manner, 461 U.S. at 106, and plaintiffs have \npointed to no evidence that would give them standing to obtain injunctive relief against such a \n \n8  The Court can take judicial notice of the fact that no record of these three inmates appears in the \nDepartment’s online database of individuals in custody.  See Ill. Dep’t of Corrections, Individual \nin  Custody  Search,  https://idoc.illinois.gov/offender/inmatesearch.html  (last  visited  May  21, \n2024); Parker v. Jefferys, 2020 WL 3413000, at *3 (S.D. Ill. June 22, 2020) (Yandle, J.) (taking \njudicial notice of an inmate’s incarceration status using this database). \n51 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 58 of 65   Page ID #22177\n \n“speculative” possibility.  Stewart, 5 F.3d at 1038.  And to the extent plaintiffs seek injunctive \nrelief against the possibility they will personally experience future facility-wide shakedowns \nconducted pursuant to Department policy while they are incarcerated, supra pp. 33-39, the record \nis devoid of evidence regarding the Department’s ongoing practices on that score, given plaintiffs’ \nfocus on obtaining relief for events that occurred in 2014.  Plaintiffs thus lack standing to obtain \nany injunctive relief. \nFor similar reasons, any official-capacity claims plaintiffs intend to press as to the Director \nfail on the merits.  The Director is amenable to suit, if at all, only to remedy “an ongoing violation \nof federal law.”  Driftless Area Land Conservancy v. Valcq, 16 F.4th 508, 521 (7th Cir. 2021).  But \nplaintiffs have identified no ongoing violation of federal law.  As explained, supra pp. 33-39, the \npolicies and procedures the Department established and implemented in 2014 to govern searches \nat its facilities do not violate the Eighth Amendment.  And there is no evidence that the things \nplaintiffs allege occurred in 2014 that departed from Department policy—reverse strip searches, \nuncomfortably close line movement, and the like—are “ongoing.”  See Driftless, 16 F.4th at 522 \n(“An ongoing violation of federal law is one that is ‘continuing.’” (quoting Green v. Mansour, 474 \nU.S. 64, 68 (1985)).  So even if a jury were to conclude that plaintiffs’ rights were violated “at one \ntime or over a period of time in the past,” id., that would not entitle them to prospective relief \nagainst the Director today.  Indeed, the Department’s policies have changed in multiple respects \nin the past decade, as would be expected of any large institution—changes plaintiffs have made no \neffort to identify or develop evidence on.  The Director is thus entitled to summary judgment as to \nplaintiffs’ official-capacity claims, to the extent plaintiffs continue to pursue them. \nC.  Plaintiffs’ IIED Claims Are Barred By Sovereign Immunity And Fail On The \nMerits. \nThe Court should also grant summary judgment to all defendants (supervisory and non-) \n52 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 59 of 65   Page ID #22178\n \non Count V, which alleges that defendants committed the state-law tort of intentional infliction of \nemotional distress (“IIED”).  Compl. 45-50 (¶¶ 104-109).  The IIED claim fails for two separate \nreasons. \nFirst, plaintiffs’ IIED claim is barred by Illinois state-law sovereign immunity and cannot \nbe heard in federal court.  Illinois’s law of sovereign immunity governs state-law claims brought \nagainst the State in federal court.  T.S. v. Cook Cnty., 67 F.4th 884, 890 (7th Cir. 2023).  And under \nIllinois law, “the State of Illinois shall not be made a defendant or party in any court.”  745 ILCS \n5/1.  Instead, as the Seventh Circuit held just last year, “the Illinois Court of Claims has exclusive \njurisdiction over ‘all claims against the State founded upon any law of the State of Illinois.’”  T.S., \n67 F.4th at 891 (quoting 705 ILCS 505/8(a)).   \nPlaintiffs’ IIED claim is a “claim[] against the State,” 705 ILCS 505/8(a), and thus belongs \nin the Court of Claims, not in federal court.  As the Seventh Circuit explained in T.S., the State’s \nsovereign immunity “cannot be evaded by making an action nominally one against the servants or \nagents of the State.”  67 F.4th at 891.  In such a case, a court looks to three factors to assess whether \nan action is genuinely one against the State: (a) whether the defendant was acting within the scope \nof his authority in taking the action in question; (b) whether the duty the defendant is alleged to \nhave breached is one owed to the public independent of State employment; and (c) whether the \n“complained-of actions involve matters ordinarily within that employee’s normal and official \nfunctions of the State.”  Healy v. Vaupel, 549 N.E.2d 1240, 1247 (Ill. 1990); see T.S., 67 F.4th at \n892-93.  Here, as in T.S., all three factors establish that plaintiffs’ IIED claim is a claim against the \nState, not against the defendants as individuals:  The defendants acted within the scope of their \nauthority as Department officials in conducting the 2014 facility-wide searches, as plaintiffs agree, \nsee Compl. 45 (¶ 108); they allegedly breached a duty they owed to plaintiffs only by virtue of that \n53 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 60 of 65   Page ID #22179\n \nauthority, see T.S., 67 F.4th at 893 (likewise concluding that “any duty” defendant “owed to the \ndetainees stem[med] solely from his role as superintendent”); and the facility-wide searches were \n“matters ordinarily within” the defendants’ “normal and official functions,” Healy, 549 N.E.2d at \n1247.  The IIED claim is thus one against the State, not against the defendants as individuals, and \nit is barred by sovereign immunity. \nThe Court previously rejected defendants’ motion to dismiss the IIED claim on sovereign-\nimmunity grounds, reasoning that the “officer suit” exception to sovereign immunity applied.  Doc. \n76 at 8-9.  Under that exception, state sovereign immunity does not apply “when it is alleged that \nthe State’s agent acted in violation of statutory or constitutional law or in excess of his authority.”  \nHealy, 549 N.E.2d at 1247; see T.S., 67 F.4th at 893-95 (discussing this exception).  But since the \nCourt issued that opinion, the Illinois Supreme Court has clarified that the officer-suit exception \napplies only to claims seeking prospective injunctive or declaratory relief; it “does not apply in a \ndamages suit.”  T.S., 67 F.4th at 894; see Parmar v. Madigan, 106 N.E.3d 1004, 1010 (Ill. 2018) \n(“[A] complaint seeking damages for a past wrong does not fall within the officer suit exception \nto sovereign immunity.”); Green v. State, 229 N.E.3d 387, 394-95 (Ill. App. 2023).  The officer-\nsuit exception thus does not salvage the IIED claim, which should be dismissed as to all defendants. \nSecond, and independently, the IIED claim fails on the merits as to (a) the supervisory \ndefendants and (b) the 432 non-supervisory defendants who have moved for summary judgment, \nbecause there is no evidence that these defendants intended to cause any harm to plaintiffs, much \nless acted in the outrageous manner required under Illinois law.  See, e.g., Feltmeier v. Feltmeier, \n798 N.E.2d 75, 80 (Ill. 2003); Benton v. Little League Baseball, Inc., 181 N.E.3d 902, 926 (Ill. \nApp. 2020).  Under Illinois law, conduct is not actionable as IIED unless (a) it is “truly extreme \nand outrageous” and (b) the defendant either “intend that his conduct inflict severe emotional \n54 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 61 of 65   Page ID #22180\n \ndistress, or know that there is at least a high probability” that the conduct would do so.  Feltmeier, \n798 N.E.2d at 80 (emphasis in original).  The record here is devoid of such evidence, for all the \nreasons set out in this motion.  All defendants acted with a valid penological purpose in designing \nand implementing the 2014 facility-wide searches, supra pp. 33-39, and there is no evidence that \neither (a) the supervisory defendants developed and oversaw the execution of a uniform plan that \nwas designed specifically to harm plaintiffs, supra pp. 39-45, or (b) the individual defendants who \nhave moved for summary judgment personally caused any named or consolidated plaintiff any \nsuch harm, supra pp. 47-48.  Absent such evidence, the IIED claim fails. \nIV.  In The Alternative, The Court Should Grant Partial Summary Judgment As To \nAspects of Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment Claims. \nDefendants have explained why the Court should grant summary judgment on all claims \nas to essentially all defendants, leaving only individual Eighth Amendment claims brought against \nnine individual tact team officers (see supra p. 47 n.5).  Even if the Court disagrees, however, it \nshould grant partial summary judgment as to those “part[s]” of plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment \nclaims, Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), on which there is no genuine dispute of material fact.  Doing so \nwould promote the just and efficient resolution of this complex case—with almost 10,000 plaintiffs \nand over 400 defendants—by ensuring that only those aspects of plaintiffs’ claims with arguable \nmerit proceed to trial. \nRule 56(a) expressly permits a party to seek, and a court to grant, partial summary judgment \non a subclaim—in the Rule’s words, a “part of [a] claim.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  Rule 56(a) thus \npermits a court to provide an “issue-narrowing adjudication,” i.e., one that disposes of “legal issues \nthat make up parts of various claims” to streamline a case as it proceeds toward trial.  Servicios \nEspeciales Al Comercio Exterior v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 791 F. Supp. 2d 626, 632 (E.D. Wis. \n2011).  If the Court concludes there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to some aspect of \n55 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 62 of 65   Page ID #22181\n \nplaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claims, but that there is no such dispute as to other aspects of those \nclaims, it should grant partial summary judgment as to any subclaims as to which the summary \njudgment standard is met.   \nThe Court should grant partial summary judgment on any subclaim on which defendants \nhave met the summary judgment standard even if it allows some part of the Eighth Amendment \nclaims to proceed to trial.  For instance: \n•  Policies  and  procedures.    Defendants  have  explained  why  plaintiffs’  Eighth \nAmendment  claims  fail  as  a  matter  of  law  to  the  extent  they  challenge  the \nDepartment’s policies and procedures.  Supra pp. 33-39.  If the Court agrees, but \nconcludes that a material question of fact remains as to whether some or all \ndefendants deviated from those policies in 2014, supra pp. 39-45, it should grant \npartial summary judgment to defendants on those aspects of the Eighth Amendment \nclaims that challenge Department policy. \n•  Discrete allegations. Defendants have also explained why discrete practices that \noccurred during the 2014 searches (including the noise made by officers upon \nentering the cellblock and the instruction that inmates should dress only in prison \nuniforms after being searched) do not violate the Eighth Amendment.  Supra pp. \n38-39.  If the Court agrees, but concludes that other alleged conduct may have \nviolated the Eighth Amendment, it should grant partial summary judgment on those \naspects of the Eighth Amendment claims that fail as a matter of law. \nAn order granting partial summary judgment to defendants as to any aspects of the case in which \nplaintiffs have failed to identify evidence on which a jury could find defendants liable would have \nthe effect of clarifying the issues that remain in this case if some portion of it is to proceed to trial. \n56 \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 642   Filed 05/22/24   Page 63 of 65   Page ID #22182\n \nCONCLUSION \n  The astronomer Carl Sagan once said that “extraordinary claims require extraordinary \nevidence.”  By alleging a clandestine uniform plan that required hundreds of officers to deviate \nfrom Department policies at the direction of high-ranking state officials for the sole purpose of \nharassing inmates for reasons unknown, plaintiffs have satisfied the first part of Mr. Sagan’s \naphorism.  As to the second, however, plaintiffs have failed not only to identify extraordinary \nevidence, they have failed to identify any evidence at all.  Defendants’ motion for summary \njudgment should be granted. \n \n              Respectfully submitted, \nKWAME RAOUL \nAttorney General of Illinois \n \n/s/ Emma Steimel       \nEmma Steimel \nAssistant Attorney General \n115 S.

In late April 2014, the “Orange Crush” conducted a shakedown of cells \nat Illinois River Correctional Center (Illinois River).  Rather than pursue this \nshakedown as a legitimate security procedure, however, Defendants beat, sexually \nhumiliated, and otherwise abused Mr. Ross (and hundreds of other prisoners), \ndestroyed his property, and otherwise gratuitously inflicted punishment for the sole \npurpose of causing humiliation and needless pain.  Plaintiff seeks damages for his \ninjuries (and those of other similarly abused prisoners), and an injunction \nprohibiting Defendants from inflicting such abuse during future searches. \n2.  For example, Mr. Ross and other prisoners at Illinois River were \nsubject to: a humiliating strip search in front of female officers and orders to \nprisoners to touch their genitals and then use the same hand to open their mouths; \npainfully tight handcuffing with their palms outward; orders to march from their \nhousing units to the gym at the facility with their heads on the backs of the \nprisoners ahead of them in line so that one man’s genitals were in direct contact \nwith the next man’s buttocks (referred to by the Orange Crush team as “Nuts to \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed 03/19/15   Page 7 of 31   Page ID #7\nButts”); violent attacks by Defendant Orange Crush Officers when prisoners broke \nthat formation; and orders to stand in a stress position for several hours.  \nThroughout the entire shakedown, Defendant Orange Crush Officers hurled \nepithets at the prisoners, chanted “punish the inmate,” and told them that this was \npunishment for their sins. \n3.  Defendants’ conduct at Illinois River was not an aberration.  Rather, \n“Orange Crush” has conducted similar abusive strip searches and shakedowns at \nother Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) facilities, including Menard \nCorrectional Center (Menard), Big Muddy River Correctional Center (Big Muddy \nRiver), and Lawrence Correctional Center (Lawrence).  All of these shakedowns are \nthe direct result of unconstitutional policies and practices in place at the IDOC to \nconduct periodic Orange Crush shakedowns so as to inflict pain and humiliation on \nprisoners entrusted to its care. \n4.  The painful and humiliating shakedowns inflicted physical injuries—\nincluding headaches, dizziness, wrist pain, and lower back pain—and emotional \ninjuries—including severe embarrassment, fear, stress, trauma, and humiliation. \nJurisdiction and Venue \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 \nand 1367. \n6.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). On information and belief, \none or more Defendants reside in this judicial district, and a substantial portion of \nthe events giving rise to the claims asserted herein occurred within this district. \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed 03/19/15   Page 8 of 31   Page ID #8\nParties \n7.

As the Acting Director of the IDOC, \nDefendant Stolworthy acts under color of law. \nAllegations \n19.  In late April 2014, Illinois River was put on lockdown for \napproximately one week.  During the lockdown, Defendant Orange Crush Officers \nconducted a shakedown of each house at the facility. \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed 03/19/15   Page 13 of 31   Page ID #13\n20.  Upon entering each wing of the facility, Defendant Orange Crush \nOfficers would yell loudly and began making loud “whooping” noises, and hitting \ntheir batons on the walls, tables, doors, and railings in the wing. \n21.  Two of the Orange Crush officers lined up in front of each cell in the \nwing, and yelled at the men in the wing to “get asshole naked!”  Once the prisoners \nwere undressed, they ordered each man to come out of his cell, one at a time.  They \nordered each prisoner to bend over while facing their cell (leaving their backs to the \nofficers), and spread their buttocks and lift each foot off the ground. \n22.  Defendant Orange Crush Officers then ordered the men to turn around \nto face the officers, and to lift their genitals.  Next, they were ordered to open their \nmouths with their fingers, using the same hands that they had just used to touch \ntheir genitals and buttocks. Prisoners who asked to wash their hands before putting \nthem into their mouths were told to “shut the fuck up!” and were threatened with \nsegregation if they did not comply.  Some of the Defendant Orange Crush Officers \npresent in the housing unit during the strip search were female. \n23.  When Defendant Orange Crush Officers finished strip searching the \nfirst group of prisoners in the cells, they ordered them to return to their cell and to \nget dressed in pants, overshirts, and shoes.  They were told that they could not put \non any underwear.  While those men were putting on the permitted clothing, \nDefendant Orange Crush Officers repeated the same process with the other men in \nthe cells. \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed 03/19/15   Page 14 of 31   Page ID #14\n24.  Once all of the strip searches were completed, Defendant Orange \nCrush Officers ordered the men to face the wall (with their backs to the officers) and \nto “keep [their] fucking heads down!”  Any prisoner who looked at the officers was \nslammed into the wall and told to “put [his] fucking head down!”  Defendant Orange \nCrush Officers then handcuffed all of the men in a particularly painful way—with \nthe palms of their hands facing outwards and their thumbs pointed up to the sky.  \nThe handcuffs were also extremely tight, causing injuries to the prisoners’ wrists, \nand eliciting complaints from the prisoners.  They were told to “shut the fuck up!” \nand to “keep [their] fucking head[s] down!” and were threatened with segregation if \nthey did not comply.  Some of the prisoners asked to see a nurse or other medical \nstaff.  Their requests received the same response.  All of the prisoners were \nhandcuffed in the same way, regardless of whether they had a “front cuff” permit \nissued by medical staff (a medical order requiring correctional officers to handcuff \nmen with their hands in front of them, rather than behind). \n25.  The men were ordered to line up and told to keep their heads down.  \nDefendant Orange Crush Officers then lined up next to the prisoners, hitting their \nbatons in their hands, and chanting “punish the inmate.”  This went on for several \nminutes. \n26.  Once the chanting stopped, Defendant Orange Crush Officers grabbed \nthe back of each prisoner’s head and slammed it violently into the back of the \nprisoner ahead of him in line.  Defendant Orange Crush Officers ordered the \nprisoners to stand in such a way that one man’s genitals were in direct contact with \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed 03/19/15   Page 15 of 31   Page ID #15\nthe buttocks of the man ahead of him in line—referred to by Defendant Orange \nCrush Officers as “Nuts to Butts.”  Mr. Ross’s head was slammed down so violently \nthat his glasses broke and fell from his face.  He suffered extreme dizziness and \nlightheadedness as a result. \n27.  Defendant Orange Crush Officers then shoved their batons in between \neach prisoner’s legs and jerked upwards, forcing the prisoner to straighten his legs \nwhile keeping his back bent over at a 90-degree angle onto the prisoner in front of \nhim.  This had the effect of forcing the men to place their genitals directly against \nthe buttocks of the men in front of them.  The officers then ordered the prisoners, \nusing several epithets, to march in that formation from their housing wing to the \ngym at the facility.  As the men began marching, the officers yelled that they didn’t \n“want to see any fucking daylight” between any of the prisoners in line. \n28.  The march from the housing wing to the gym was long and painful.  \nEvery time that a prisoner’s head came off of the back of the prisoner in front of \nhim, officers responded with violence.  Defendant Orange Crush Officers would \nslam the prisoner’s head into the back of the prisoner in front of him.  Some, like \nMr. Ross, were violently yanked out of the line, and choked and pulled to the ground \nwhile other officers jabbed them in their backs with batons.  Each time this \noccurred, the line would stop moving.  The frequent starts and stops of the \nprocession, as well as the inherent difficulty that prisoners had maintaining perfect \ncontact with the prisoner ahead of them in line, forced several prisoners to break \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed 03/19/15   Page 16 of 31   Page ID #16\ncontact with the prisoner in front of them, causing them to be attacked by the \nofficers. \n29.  When the procession of prisoners arrived at the gym, Defendant \nOrange Crush Officers ordered them to stand facing the wall with their heads down.  \nThey remained handcuffed.  Many of the officers then left the gym to return to the \nhousing wing.  Defendant Albright, however, remained in the gym with the \nprisoners. \n30.  The prisoners remained standing in this stress position for several \nhours.  During that time, Defendant Albright yelled at the prisoners: “This is \npunishment for all your sins!”  He ordered the prisoners not to ask for medical \nattention because none would be provided, not to ask for water because none would \nbe given, and not to ask to use the bathroom because they would be denied.  He \nfurther told the prisoners that if their handcuffs were too tight, they would have to \n“be a man and take it or get dragged to seg!” \n31.  After several hours, the other Defendant Orange Crush Officers \nreturned.  They lined up the prisoners in the same formation as before, and again \nslammed their heads into the backs of the prisoners in front of them.  They again \nordered the prisoners to march in that formation back to their housing wing.  Just \nas before, if a prisoner broke the line by lifting his head off the back of the person in \nfront of him, Defendant Orange Crush Officers reacted with violence. \n32.  Defendant Orange Crush Officers laughed at and taunted the \nprisoners throughout the entire march to and from the gym. \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed 03/19/15   Page 17 of 31   Page ID #17\n33.  When they at last returned to their housing wing, the prisoners found \ntheir cells had been “tossed.”  Many of the prisoners found that non-contraband \nitems had been taken, including legal documents and property that they had \nlegitimately purchased from the commissary at the facility.  Although IDOC policies \nrequire staff to complete “shakedown slips” to document any property taken from a \nprisoner, many prisoners did not receive any shakedown slips at all.  Those \nprisoners who did receive “shakedown slips” found that they contained an \ninaccurate account of what had been taken and also that the slips obscured the \nofficers’ names who had confiscated the property.  Upon information and belief, this \nwas done intentionally, as policy, to conceal the identity of Defendant Orange Crush \nOfficers who had participated in the shakedown. \n34.  One of the prisoners asked an officer to get the warden, Defendant \nGreg Gossett.  In response, the officer laughed and told him that the warden \nalready knew all about what was happening at the facility. \n35.  The prisoners suffered physical injuries as a result of the shakedown \nat the facility, including severe headaches, dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred \nvision, and severe pain in their neck and back from the march.  Many prisoners \ncomplained about these injuries to the officers during the shakedown and march, \nand upon return to their cells.  They were all denied medical attention.  Officers \ninstead told them to “submit a grievance like you inmates always do.” \n36.  This was neither the first nor the last such shakedown conducted by \nIDOC officials.  In early April 2014, Defendant Orange Crush Officers executed the \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed 03/19/15   Page 18 of 31   Page ID #18\nsame shakedown at Menard.  In mid-May 2014, they carried out the same \nshakedown at Big Muddy River.  In July 2014, they targeted Lawrence.  At each of \nthese facilities, Defendant Orange Crush Officers conducted the same humiliating \nstrip search in front of female members of the Orange Crush team.  At each of these \nfacilities, they forced prisoners to march out of their housing units in a “Nuts to \nButts” procession.  Every time any prisoner in these facilities failed to comply with \nDefendant Orange Crush Officers’ unreasonable demands, Defendants reacted with \nviolence.  Throughout all of the shakedowns, Defendant Orange Crush Officers \ntaunted, yelled at, and violently attacked prisoners solely to harass and humiliate \nthem. \n37.  On information and belief, Defendant Orange Crush Officers executed \ntheir unconstitutional and cruel shakedown procedures at Illinois River, Big Muddy \nRiver, Lawrence, and Menard in 2014 pursuant to a policy or practice implemented, \noverseen, and encouraged by IDOC supervisors, including Defendants Yurkovich, \nGossett, Roeckeman, Duncan, and Butler. \n38.  To this day, IDOC prisoners—including prisoners housed at Illinois \nRiver, Big Muddy River, Lawrence, and Menard—continue to be subjected to \nshakedown procedures like the ones described in this Complaint.  Despite several \nprisoners’ repeated requests for the abuse by Defendants to stop, Defendants \ncontinue to maintain and encourage the above-described policy or practice. \n \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed 03/19/15   Page 19 of 31   Page ID #19\nClass Allegations \n39.  Named Plaintiff Demetrius Ross seeks to pursue claims both for \nhimself individually and for a class of others similarly situated (the Class) pursuant \nto Rule 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n40.  Named Plaintiff Demetrius Ross seeks to represent a class consisting \nof the following people:  All individuals housed at Illinois River, Big Muddy River, \nLawrence, and Menard who were subjected to the 2014 shakedowns, and all \nprisoners confined to those facilities presently or who may be so confined in the \nfuture. \n41.  The individuals in this class are so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impractical.  According to the IDOC’s website, on July 1, 2014, there \nwere 2,073 men housed at Illinois River, 1,878 men housed at Big Muddy River, \n2,367 men housed at Lawrence, and 3,757 men housed at Menard.   \n42.  There are questions of law and fact common to the claims of the Class.  \nAmong these common questions are: \na.  Whether the strip search as conducted as Illinois River violated \nprisoners’ rights under the Eighth Amendment; \nb.  Whether Defendants violated the constitutional rights of the \nprisoners by forcing them to march with their heads on the backs or buttocks of the \nprisoners ahead of them in line so that one man’s genitals were in direct contact \nwith the next man’s buttocks; \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed 03/19/15   Page 20 of 31   Page ID #20\nc.  Whether Defendants violated the constitutional rights of the \nprisoners by violently forcing their heads into the backs of the prisoners ahead of \nthem in line; and \nd.  Whether forcing prisoners to stand in stress positions for several \nhours constituted cruel and unusual punishment. \n43.  Demetrius Ross’s claims are typical of the claims of the Class.  Mr. \nRoss was a prisoner at Illinois River and was subjected to the abusive and \ninhumane shakedown executed by Defendant Orange Crush Officers.  His \ntreatment during the shakedown in late April 2014 is typical of other prisoners \nthroughout Illinois River, and at the other facilities where the Orange Crush team \nconducted these abusive shakedowns.  He seeks to prove that the tactics employed \nby Defendants in conducting the shakedown violated the constitutional rights of the \nClass, and to obtain an injunction prohibiting Defendants from inflicting that abuse \nduring future searches. \n44.  Demetrius Ross will fairly and adequately represent the interests of \nthe Class.  He has retained skilled counsel with experience in class actions, and \nconstitutional and prisoners’ rights litigation. \n45.  The questions of law and fact common to the Class predominate over \nany individual issues.  In addition, a class action would be the fairest and most \nefficient way to adjudicate the Class members’ claims. \n \n \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed 03/19/15   Page 21 of 31   Page ID #21\nCOUNT I \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – Cruel & Unusual Punishment (Eighth Amendment) \n \n46.  Plaintiff incorporates each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully \nrestated here. \n47.  As described more fully above, Defendants inflicted unnecessary \nphysical and emotional pain and suffering on Mr. Ross and other prisoners similarly \nsituated to him.  They did so intentionally, wantonly, and/or with malice. \n48.  Alternatively, Defendants knew the risk of harm that their misconduct \nposed to those prisoners and nevertheless acted with deliberate indifference in \nexecuting the shakedowns at Illinois River, Big Muddy River, Lawrence, and \nMenard. \n49.  As a result of Defendants’ unjustified and unconstitutional conduct, \nMr. Ross and other prisoners similarly situated to him suffered pain, emotional \ndistress, and injuries. \n50.  The misconduct described in this Count was undertaken intentionally, \nwith malice, and/or with reckless indifference to the rights of Mr. Ross and other \nprisoners similarly situated to him. \n51.  The injuries of Mr. Ross and other prisoners similarly situated to him \nwere proximately caused by the policies and practices of the IDOC Defendants. \n52.  On information and belief, Defendant Orange Crush Officers executed \ntheir unconstitutional and cruel shakedown at Illinois River pursuant to a policy or \npractice implemented and overseen by Defendant Yurkovich and other IDOC \nsupervisors regarding shakedowns at IDOC facilities.  Accordingly, Defendant \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed 03/19/15   Page 22 of 31   Page ID #22\nYurkovich, who was responsible for supervision and oversight of the Orange Crush \nteam, directly encouraged the very type of misconduct at issue in this case, failed to \nprovide adequate training and supervision of Defendant Orange Crush Officers, and \nfailed to adequately punish and discipline prior instances of similar misconduct.  In \nthis way, Defendant Yurkovich violated the rights of Mr. Ross, and other prisoners \nhoused at Illinois River, Big Muddy River, Lawrence, and Menard by maintaining \nand implementing policies and practices that were the moving force driving the \nforegoing constitutional violations. \n53.  On information and belief, Defendants Greg Gossett, Zach Roeckeman, \nStephen Duncan, Kim Butler, and Joseph Yurkovich had notice of widespread \npolicies and practices of Defendant Orange Crush Officers and other members of the \nOrange Crush team, pursuant to which prisoners were subjected to unconstitutional \nand tortious acts of violence and humiliation, as described more fully above.  \nDespite knowledge of these problematic policies and practices, Defendants Gossett, \nRoeckeman, Duncan, Butler, and Yurkovich did nothing to ensure that the \nprisoners at their facilities were treated humanely and in accordance with the \nrights afforded to them by the United States Constitution.  These widespread \npolicies and practices were allowed to flourish because Defendants Gossett, \nRoeckeman, Duncan, Butler, and Yurkovich directly encouraged the very type of \nmisconduct at issue in this case, and failed to provide adequate training and \nsupervision of Orange Crush team members.  In this way, Defendants Gossett, \nRoeckeman, Duncan, Butler, and Yurkovich violated the rights of Mr. Ross, and \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed 03/19/15   Page 23 of 31   Page ID #23\nother prisoners similarly situated to him, by maintaining and implementing policies \nand practices that were the moving force driving the foregoing constitutional \nviolations. \n54.  The above-described policies and practices were able to exist and thrive \nbecause Defendants Gossett, Roeckeman, Duncan, Butler, and Yurkovich were \ndeliberately indifferent to the problem, thereby effectively ratifying it. \n55.  The injuries of Mr. Ross and those similarly situated to him were \ncaused by employees of the IDOC, including but not limited to the individually \nnamed Defendants, who acted pursuant to the foregoing policies and practices in \nengaging in the misconduct described in this Count. \n56.  Defendants continue to this day to perform shakedowns at IDOC \nfacilities, including Illinois River, Big Muddy River, Lawrence, and Menard, using \nthe unconstitutional and cruel methods described more fully above.  Accordingly, \nMr. Ross, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated to him, seeks \ninjunctive relief from this Court to stop the continuing constitutional violation. \n57.  Mr. Ross, on behalf of himself and all similarly situated prisoners, also \nseeks actual and punitive damages. \nCOUNT II \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – Conspiracy \n \n58.  Plaintiff incorporates each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully \nrestated here. \n59.  Defendants reached an agreement among themselves to deprive the \nprisoners housed at Illinois River, Big Muddy River, Lawrence, and Menard \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed 03/19/15   Page 24 of 31   Page ID #24\n(including Mr. Ross) of their constitutional rights and to protect one another from \nliability for depriving the prisoners of their rights, all as described in the various \nparagraphs of this Complaint. \n60.  In furtherance of the conspiracy, each of the co-conspirators committed \novert acts and was an otherwise willful participant in joint activity. \n61.  The misconduct described in this Count was undertaken intentionally, \nwith malice, and/or with reckless indifference to the rights of Mr. Ross and other \nprisoners similarly situated to him. \n62.  As a direct and proximate result of the illicit prior agreement \nreferenced above, the rights of the prisoners at Illinois River, Big Muddy River, \nLawrence, and Menard (including Mr. Ross) were violated and they suffered \ninjuries, including pain, suffering, and emotional distress.  \n63.  These injuries were caused by employees of the IDOC, including but \nnot limited to the individually named Defendants, who acted pursuant to the \npolicies and practices described above. \n64.  Defendants continue to this day to conspire to deprive Mr. Ross, and \nother prisoners similarly situated to him, of their constitutional rights and to \nprotect one another from liability for the deprivation of those rights, all as described \nin the various paragraphs of this Complaint.  Accordingly, Mr. Ross, on behalf of \nhimself and all others similarly situated to him, seeks injunctive relief from this \nCourt to stop the continuing constitutional violation. \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed 03/19/15   Page 25 of 31   Page ID #25\n65.  Mr. Ross, on behalf of himself and all similarly situated prisoners, also \nseeks actual and punitive damages. \nCOUNT III \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – Failure to Intervene (Eighth Amendment) \n \n66.  Plaintiff incorporates each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully \nrestated here. \n67.  As described more fully above, Defendants each had a reasonable \nopportunity to prevent the violation of the constitutional rights of the prisoners \nhoused at Illinois River, Big Muddy River, Lawrence, and Menard (including Mr. \nRoss) as set forth above had they been so inclined.  They failed to do so. \n68.  Defendants’ actions were undertaken intentionally, with malice, and/or \nwith reckless indifference to the rights of the prisoners housed at these facilities. \n69.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ misconduct, the rights \nof Mr. Ross, and other prisoners similarly situated to him, were violated and they \nsuffered injuries, including pain, suffering, and emotional distress. \n70.  Mr. Ross’s injuries, and the injuries of those prisoners similarly \nsituated to him, were caused by employees of the IDOC, including but not limited to \nthe individually named Defendants, who acted pursuant to the policies and \npractices described more fully above. \n71.  Mr. Ross, on behalf of himself and all similarly situated prisoners, \nseeks actual and punitive damages for Defendants’ violation of the constitutional \nrights of the prisoners at Illinois River, Big Muddy River, Lawrence, and Menard. \n \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed 03/19/15   Page 26 of 31   Page ID #26\nCOUNT IV \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – Prison Rape Elimination Act \n \n72.  Plaintiff incorporates each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully \nrestated here. \n73.  By executing and encouraging the shakedowns described more fully \nabove, Defendants have violated and continue to violate several provisions of the \nPrison Rape Elimination Act National Standards, 28 C.F.R. § 115, promulgated by \nthe United States Attorney General pursuant to the Prison Rape Elimination Act, \n42 U.S.C. § 15607. \n74.  Defendants have conducted and continue to conduct cross-gender strip \nsearches of Mr. Ross and all similarly situated prisoners, in violation of 28 C.F.R. \n§ 115.15.  There are no exigent circumstances present during these shakedowns to \njustify cross-gender strip searches. \n75.  Despite several prisoners’ repeated reports of the sexual abuse and \nharassment that they have suffered and continue to suffer, Defendant Stolworthy \nrefuses to conduct any administrative or criminal investigation into the misconduct \ncommitted by Defendant Orange Crush Officers, in violation of 28 C.F.R. §§ 115.22 \nand 115.71. \n76.  On information and belief, Defendant Stolworthy has failed and \ncontinues to fail to provide adequate training to Defendants and other IDOC staff \non any IDOC policy prohibiting sexual abuse and sexual harassment, in violation of \n28 C.F.R. § 115.31. \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed 03/19/15   Page 27 of 31   Page ID #27\n77.  Defendant Stolworthy refuses to provide a proper channel for prisoners \nto report the sexual abuse and harassment that they suffer to any public or private \nentity not part of the IDOC, in violation of 28 C.F.R. § 115.51.  He similarly refuses \nto provide a proper channel for prisoners to report that sexual abuse and \nharassment privately within the IDOC. \n78.  Instead, when prisoners like Mr. Ross complain about the sexual abuse \nand harassment that they are suffering, their complaints are referred to the same \nDefendants who perpetrated the abuse and harassment, in violation of 28 C.F.R. \n§ 115.52. \n79.  On information and belief, none of the Defendants has been disciplined \nfor the sexual abuse and harassment that they perpetrated on Mr. Ross and other \nprisoners subjected to the same sexual abuse and harassment, in violation of 28 \nC.F.R. § 115.76. \n80.  Mr. Ross and other prisoners similarly situated to him have been \ndenied access to medical care, in violation of 28 C.F.R. § 115.82. \n81.   In sum, Defendant Stolworthy has grossly failed to protect prisoners \nlike Mr. Ross from the sexual abuse and harassment that they have suffered and \ncontinue to suffer at the hands of the Orange Crush team.  This abuse is precisely \nthe same type of misconduct that the Prison Rape Elimination Act sought to \neliminate.  Accordingly, Mr. Ross, on behalf of himself and all others similarly \nsituated to him, seeks injunctive relief from this Court to require Defendants to \ncomply with the Prison Rape Elimination Act National Standards. \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed 03/19/15   Page 28 of 31   Page ID #28\nCOUNT V \nIntentional Infliction of Emotional Distress \n \n82.  Plaintiff incorporates each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully \nrestated here. \n83.  In the manner described more fully above, Defendants engaged in \nextreme and outrageous conduct.  Those actions were rooted in an abuse of power or \nauthority. \n84.  Defendants’ actions as set forth above were undertaken with intent or \nknowledge that there was a high probability that the conduct would inflict severe \nemotional distress and with reckless disregard of that probability. \n85.  Defendants’ actions as set forth above were undertaken intentionally, \nwith malice, and/or with reckless indifference to the rights of the prisoners housed \nat Illinois River, Big Muddy River, Lawrence, and Menard. \n86.  The misconduct described in this Count was undertaken by \nDefendants within the scope of their employment. \n87.  As a direct and proximate result of this misconduct, Mr. Ross, and \nother prisoners similarly situated to him,, experienced injuries, severe emotional \ndistress, and suffering. \nWherefore, Plaintiff, Demetrius Ross, on behalf of himself and all others \nsimilarly situated, respectfully requests that this Court enter a judgment in his \nfavor and against Defendants, Greg Gossett, Zach Roeckeman, Stephen Duncan, \nKim Butler, Joseph Yurkovich, Donald Stolworthy, Brian Piper, Brendan Ankrom, \nJustin Hammers, Brad Johnson, Fred Williams, Frank Thompson, Derek Smith, \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309   Document 1   Filed 03/19/15   Page 29 of 31   Page ID #29\nSteve Albrecht, Robert Adams, Sarah Arnett, Bryan Bailey, Shawn Bailliez, \nAndrew Bottrell, Larry Boyd, Douglas Brown, Dennis Bucco, Vincent Cogdal, Nick \nConklin, Jason Dams, Robert Dorethy, Olin Eldridge, Lisa Ellinger, Curtis Jenkins, \nScott Lamb, Chris Luker, Canduce Morrill, Andrew Moser, William Myers, Lee \nParker, Chad Sappington, Ron Shoultz, Jamie Skaggs, Cally Stein, Mike \nStufflebeam, Ashley Thompson, Steve Wilcoxen, Drew Derenzy, Justin Dircks, \nDavid English, M.

(rah) \n(Entered: 03/25/2016) \n03/28/2016  106   ORDER denying 105 Motion for Reconsideration. Plaintiff asks the \nCourt to reconsider its ruling denying his motion for a default judgment \nand granting Defendant Butler's request for an extension. Plaintiff has \nprovided no new legal grounds, facts, or extraordinary circumstances \nthat would justify reconsideration. In fact, Plaintiff's main argument is \nthat he filed \"first,\" and prior to consolidation. This is not accurate; \nPlaintiff's case was consolidated on 3/7/16, three days before he alleges \nhe filed the motion. Nor was Butler's motion for an extension untimely \nas she had until 3/8/16 to file an answer, and requested an extension on \nthat day. Plaintiff's argument that he was \"first\" is also unavailing; the \nCourt may rule on motions in any order at its discretion. If Plaintiff \nwishes to leave the class action, he may file a motion on that point, but it \nis unlikely that the Court would appoint him an attorney in those \ncircumstances.

Plaintiff's Complaint in Fisher v. \nMcCallistor, Case No. 15-cv-00007-SMY-RJD concerns shakedowns \n\nperformed by the Orange Crush Tactical Team at Menard Correctional \nCenter. The Complaint is similar to the pleading in Ross v. Gossett, Case \nNo. 15-cv-309-SMY-SCW, which was filed in this Court on March 19, \n2015. Due to similarities between the two cases and the need to \nconsolidate judicial resources concerning Orange Crush cases, this \nmatter is hereby CONSOLIDATED with the lead case, Ross v. Gossett \net al., 15-cv-309. The currently scheduled Final Pretrial Conference and \ntrial settings are hereby VACATED. Further, Defendants' motion for \nsummary judgment (Doc. 39) is DENIED without prejudice and may be \nrefiled in accordance with Judge Williams' scheduling and case \nmanagement orders in 15-cv-309.

Sarah \nGrady and Sam Hippell for Plaintiff. Susannah Price for Defendants. \nThe Court discussed with the parties ongoing ESI production by \nDefendants. The Court divided the ESI production into three groups: (1) \nemail production for identified supervisors for the time period \nsurrounding the shakedown, with priority given to 10 of these \nindividuals; (2) email production from 10 individuals during time period \nafter suit was filed; and (3) production of personal communications for \n10 individuals after suit was filed. Defendants indicated there has been a \nhigher than expected number of documents that have come to fruition as \na result of their email search. As to Group 1, they have completed \nproduction as to one of the prioritized individuals and have roughly 5000 \ndocuments for two other individuals. Defendants sought three weeks to \nexamine the 5000 documents as to these two individuals to search for \nsensitive information that, in IDOC's opinion, should be redacted. \nDefendants shall produce the 5000 batch documents no later than April \n12, 2017. This matter is set for a Discovery Dispute Conference \non April 20, 2017 at 3:15 p.m. The parties shall give an update as to \nproduction for the other two groups at that conference. Instructions for \nplacing the conference call are as follows: Call toll free 888-684-\n8852; when prompted, enter Access Code 6049846; and when \nprompted again enter Security Code 9467.(Court Reporter Laura \nEsposito.)

Plaintiff is represented by counsel in this matter, and \nhas twice already been told he shall not file motions, such as the one \nbefore the Court, pro se. (See Docs. 383, 387). Again, the Court will \nmake this very clear: Since he proceeds represented by counsel, other \nthan pleadings seeking dismissal of his current counsel, Plaintiff \nMiller SHALL NOT file documents pro se, either in this case, 15-309, \nor in 16-416. Plaintiff Miller is reminded that he could be subject to \nsanctions, personally, for disobeying an order of the Court.

The \nClerk of Court is DIRECTED to STRIKE the Motion at Doc. 398. \nSigned by Magistrate Judge Stephen C. Williams on 9/7/2017. \n(rms2)THIS TEXT ENTRY IS AN ORDER OF THE COURT.

Sarah \nGrady, Sam Heppell, and Adair Crosley for Plaintiffs. Emma Steimel for \nDefendants. Upon an in camera review of the redacted documents \nprovided, the Court is unable to make a determination as to their \nrelevancy. Therefore, for the documents provided to the Court, \nDefendants shall produce said documents, unredacted, to counsel at \n\nLoevy and Loevy in accordance with the attorneys eyes only provisions \nof the protective order. Additionally, after reviewing the documents, the \nparties shall meet and confer and attempt to reach an agreement on \nwhich documents, if any, may be retained by Plaintiffs' counsel. Should \nthe parties be unable to reach an agreement, they shall contact the Court. \nThe documents may be retained by Plaintiffs' counsel for a period of 90 \ndays. After the 90 day period, Plaintiffs' counsel shall return or destroy \nany documents the parties have not agreed are to be retained. Plaintiffs, \nhowever, may seek to review any of the documents again in the future, \nshould counsel have a good faith basis to believe that factual \ndevelopments have rendered relevant previously non-retained \ndocuments. The Court's ruling today also applies to a separate set of \nsimilar documents with security redactions that were not reviewed by the \nCourt. In addition, the Court will conduct an in camera review of \nredactions to the TACT team training manual. This matter is set for a \nDiscovery Dispute Conference on May 16, 2018 at 3:45 p.m..

Sarah \nGrady and Sam Heppell for Plaintiffs. Emma Steimel for Defendants. \nThe Court has reviewed the redacted and unredacted copies of the TACT \nteam manuals. The sections of the manual relating to the use of \nformations shall remain fully redacted and undisclosed. All other \nredactions contain information that is either potentially relevant or \nhighly relevant, and all other sections of the manual shall therefore be \nproduced unredacted. The TACT manual, however, is subject to the \nattorneys' eyes only protective order already put in place. In addition, \nDefendants raised an oral motion asking the Court to reconsider a \nportion of its May 9, 2018 ruling (Doc. 450). Defendants asked that the \ndocuments relating to STGs ordered produced in the Court's May 9 \nruling be retained by defense counsel at their Chicago office while \nallowing access to Plaintiffs' counsel to review the documents. The \nmotion is DENIED. While the Court understands Defendants' concerns \nregarding security, the Court has no reason to believe that Plaintiffs' \ncounsel do not take their obligations under the attorneys' eyes order \n\nseriously. To require Plaintiffs' counsel to have to come to defense \ncounsels' office at prearranged times in order to view the documents in \nquestion is overly burdensome and potentially prejudicial to Plaintiffs. \nFinally, the Court GRANTS the parties request to extend the deadline \nfor class certification briefing.

In late April 2014, the “Orange Crush” conducted a shakedown of cells \nat Illinois River Correctional Center (Illinois River).  Rather than pursue this \nshakedown as a legitimate security procedure, however, Defendants beat, sexually \nhumiliated, and otherwise abused Mr. Ross (and hundreds of other prisoners), \ndestroyed his property, and otherwise gratuitously inflicted punishment for the sole \npurpose of causing humiliation and needless pain.  Plaintiffs seek damages for their \ninjuries (and those of other similarly abused prisoners), and an injunction \nprohibiting Defendants from inflicting such abuse during future searches. \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY-SCW   Document 197   Filed 10/31/16   Page 13 of 51   Page ID #2359\n2.  For example, Mr. Ross and other prisoners at Illinois River were \nsubject to: a humiliating strip search in front of female officers and orders to \nprisoners to touch their genitals and then use the same hand to open their mouths; \npainfully tight handcuffing with their palms outward; orders to march from their \nhousing units to the gym at the facility with their heads on the backs of the \nprisoners ahead of them in line so that one man’s genitals were in direct contact \nwith the next man’s buttocks (referred to by the Orange Crush team as “Nuts to \nButts”); violent attacks by Defendant Orange Crush Officers when prisoners broke \nthat formation; and orders to stand in a stress position for several hours.  \nThroughout the entire shakedown, Defendant Orange Crush Officers hurled \nepithets at the prisoners, chanted “punish the inmate,” and told them that this was \npunishment for their sins. \n3.  Defendants’ conduct at Illinois River was not an aberration.  Rather, \n“Orange Crush” has conducted similar abusive strip searches and shakedowns at \nother Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) facilities, including Menard \nCorrectional Center (Menard), Big Muddy River Correctional Center (Big Muddy \nRiver), and Lawrence Correctional Center (Lawrence).  All of these shakedowns are \nthe direct result of unconstitutional policies and practices in place at the IDOC to \nconduct periodic Orange Crush shakedowns so as to inflict pain and humiliation on \nprisoners entrusted to its care. \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY-SCW   Document 197   Filed 10/31/16   Page 14 of 51   Page ID #2360\n4.  The painful and humiliating shakedowns inflicted physical injuries—\nincluding headaches, dizziness, wrist pain, and lower back pain—and emotional \ninjuries—including severe embarrassment, fear, stress, trauma, and humiliation. \nJurisdiction and Venue \n \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 \nand 1367. \n6.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).

Upon entering each wing of the facility, Defendant Orange Crush \nOfficers would yell loudly and began making loud “whooping” noises, and hitting \ntheir batons on the walls, tables, doors, and railings in the wing. \n42.  Two of the Orange Crush officers lined up in front of each cell in the \nwing, and yelled at the men in the wing to “get asshole naked!”  Once the prisoners \nwere undressed, they ordered each man to come out of his cell, one at a time.  They \nordered each prisoner to bend over while facing their cell (leaving their backs to the \nofficers), and spread their buttocks and lift each foot off the ground. \n43.  Defendant Orange Crush Officers then ordered the men to turn around \nto face the officers, and to lift their genitals.

They were told to “shut the fuck up!” \nand to “keep [their] fucking head[s] down!” and were threatened with segregation if \nthey did not comply.  Some of the prisoners asked to see a nurse or other medical \nstaff.  Their requests received the same response.  All of the prisoners were \nhandcuffed in the same way, regardless of whether they had a “front cuff” permit \nissued by medical staff (a medical order requiring correctional officers to handcuff \nmen with their hands in front of them, rather than behind). \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY-SCW   Document 197   Filed 10/31/16   Page 31 of 51   Page ID #2377\n46.  The men were ordered to line up and told to keep their heads down.  \nDefendant Orange Crush Officers then lined up next to the prisoners, hitting their \nbatons in their hands, and chanting “punish the inmate.”  This went on for several \nminutes. \n47.  Once the chanting stopped, Defendant Orange Crush Officers grabbed \nthe back of each prisoner’s head and slammed it violently into the back of the \nprisoner ahead of him in line.  Defendant Orange Crush Officers ordered the \nprisoners to stand in such a way that one man’s genitals were in direct contact with \nthe buttocks of the man ahead of him in line—referred to by Defendant Orange \nCrush Officers as “Nuts to Butts.”  Mr. Ross’s head was slammed down so violently \nthat his glasses broke and fell from his face.  He suffered extreme dizziness and \nlightheadedness as a result. \n48.  Defendant Orange Crush Officers then shoved their batons in between \neach prisoner’s legs and jerked upwards, forcing the prisoner to straighten his legs \nwhile keeping his back bent over at a 90-degree angle onto the prisoner in front of \nhim.  This had the effect of forcing the men to place their genitals directly against \nthe buttocks of the men in front of them.  The officers then ordered the prisoners, \nusing several epithets, to march in that formation from their housing wing to the \ngym at the facility.  As the men began marching, the officers yelled that they didn’t \n“want to see any fucking daylight” between any of the prisoners in line. \n49.  The march from the housing wing to the gym was long and painful.  \nEvery time that a prisoner’s head came off of the back of the prisoner in front of \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY-SCW   Document 197   Filed 10/31/16   Page 32 of 51   Page ID #2378\nhim, officers responded with violence.  Defendant Orange Crush Officers would \nslam the prisoner’s head into the back of the prisoner in front of him.  Some, like \nMr. Ross, were violently yanked out of the line, and choked and pulled to the ground \nwhile other officers jabbed them in their backs with batons.  Each time this \noccurred, the line would stop moving.  The frequent starts and stops of the \nprocession, as well as the inherent difficulty that prisoners had maintaining perfect \ncontact with the prisoner ahead of them in line, forced several prisoners to break \ncontact with the prisoner in front of them, causing them to be attacked by the \nofficers. \n50.  When the procession of prisoners arrived at the gym, Defendant \nOrange Crush Officers ordered them to stand facing the wall with their heads down.  \nThey remained handcuffed.  Many of the officers then left the gym to return to the \nhousing wing.  Defendant Albright, however, remained in the gym with the \nprisoners. \n51.  The prisoners remained standing in this stress position for several \nhours.  During that time, Defendant Albright yelled at the prisoners: “This is \npunishment for all your sins!”  He ordered the prisoners not to ask for medical \nattention because none would be provided, not to ask for water because none would \nbe given, and not to ask to use the bathroom because they would be denied.  He \nfurther told the prisoners that if their handcuffs were too tight, they would have to \n“be a man and take it or get dragged to seg!” \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY-SCW   Document 197   Filed 10/31/16   Page 33 of 51   Page ID #2379\n52.  After several hours, the other Defendant Orange Crush Officers \nreturned.  They lined up the prisoners in the same formation as before, and again \nslammed their heads into the backs of the prisoners in front of them.  They again \nordered the prisoners to march in that formation back to their housing wing.  Just \nas before, if a prisoner broke the line by lifting his head off the back of the person in \nfront of him, Defendant Orange Crush Officers reacted with violence. \n53.  Defendant Orange Crush Officers laughed at and taunted the \nprisoners throughout the entire march to and from the gym. \n54.  When they at last returned to their housing wing, the prisoners found \ntheir cells had been “tossed.”  Many of the prisoners found that non-contraband \nitems had been taken, including legal documents and property that they had \nlegitimately purchased from the commissary at the facility.  Although IDOC policies \nrequire staff to complete “shakedown slips” to document any property taken from a \nprisoner, many prisoners did not receive any shakedown slips at all.  Those \nprisoners who did receive “shakedown slips” found that they contained an \ninaccurate account of what had been taken and also that the slips obscured the \nofficers’ names who had confiscated the property.  Upon information and belief, this \nwas done intentionally, as policy, to conceal the identity of Defendant Orange Crush \nOfficers who had participated in the shakedown. \n55.  One of the prisoners asked an officer to get the warden, Defendant \nGreg Gossett.  In response, the officer laughed and told him that the warden \nalready knew all about what was happening at the facility. \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY-SCW   Document 197   Filed 10/31/16   Page 34 of 51   Page ID #2380\n56.  The prisoners suffered physical injuries as a result of the shakedown \nat the facility, including severe headaches, dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred \nvision, and severe pain in their neck and back from the march.  Many prisoners \ncomplained about these injuries to the officers during the shakedown and march, \nand upon return to their cells.  They were all denied medical attention.  Officers \ninstead told them to “submit a grievance like you inmates always do.” \n57.  This was neither the first nor the last such shakedown conducted by \nIDOC officials.  In early April 2014, Defendant Orange Crush Officers executed the \nsame shakedown at Menard.  In mid-May 2014, they carried out the same \nshakedown at Big Muddy River.  In July 2014, they targeted Lawrence.  At each of \nthese facilities, Defendant Orange Crush Officers conducted the same humiliating \nstrip search in front of female members of the Orange Crush team.  At each of these \nfacilities, they forced prisoners to march out of their housing units in a “Nuts to \nButts” procession.  Every time any prisoner in these facilities failed to comply with \nDefendant Orange Crush Officers’ unreasonable demands, Defendants reacted with \nviolence.  Throughout all of the shakedowns, Defendant Orange Crush Officers \ntaunted, yelled at, and violently attacked prisoners solely to harass and humiliate \nthem. \n58.  On information and belief, Defendant Orange Crush Officers executed \ntheir unconstitutional and cruel shakedown procedures at Illinois River, Big Muddy \nRiver, Lawrence, and Menard in 2014 pursuant to a policy or practice implemented, \n34 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY-SCW   Document 197   Filed 10/31/16   Page 35 of 51   Page ID #2381\noverseen, and encouraged by IDOC supervisors, including Defendants Yurkovich, \nGossett, Roeckeman, Duncan, and Butler, among others. \n59.  On April 2, 2014, Defendant Butler sent an email to Defendant Gaetz \nabout the shakedown and searches that had occurred at Menard.  On May 14, 2014, \na staff member from the Uptown People’s Law Center wrote to Defendant Godinez, \ndescribing the abusive and humiliating shakedowns that were occurring in \nSouthern Illinois.  Despite this notice, neither Defendant Gaetz nor Defendant \nGodinez took any action to prevent the subsequent unconstitutional shakedowns \nfrom occurring. \n60.  To this day, IDOC prisoners—including prisoners housed at Illinois \nRiver, Big Muddy River, Lawrence, and Menard—continue to be subjected to \nshakedown procedures like the ones described in this Complaint.  Despite several \nprisoners’ repeated requests for the abuse by Defendants to stop, Defendants \ncontinue to maintain and encourage the above-described policy or practice. \nClass Allegations \n61.  Named Plaintiffs Demetrius Ross, Jonathan Tolliver, Kevin Hamilton, \nGlen Verser, Zachary Watts, James Dunmore, and Ronald Smith seek to pursue \nclaims both for themselves individually and for a class of others similarly situated \n(the Class) pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure. \n62.  Named Plaintiffs Demetrius Ross, Jonathan Tolliver, Kevin Hamilton, \nGlen Verser, Zachary Watts, James Dunmore, and Ronald Smith seek to represent \n35 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY-SCW   Document 197   Filed 10/31/16   Page 36 of 51   Page ID #2382\na class consisting of the following people:  All individuals housed at Illinois River, \nBig Muddy River, Lawrence, and Menard who were subjected to the 2014 \nshakedowns, and all prisoners confined to those facilities presently or who may be \nso confined in the future. \n63.  The individuals in this class are so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impractical.  According to the IDOC’s website, on July 1, 2014, there \nwere 2,073 men housed at Illinois River, 1,878 men housed at Big Muddy River, \n2,367 men housed at Lawrence, and 3,757 men housed at Menard.   \n64.  There are questions of law and fact common to the claims of the Class.  \nAmong these common questions are: \na.  Whether the strip search as conducted as Illinois River violated \nprisoners’ rights under the Eighth Amendment; \nb.  Whether Defendants violated the constitutional rights of the \nprisoners by forcing them to march with their heads on the backs or buttocks of the \nprisoners ahead of them in line so that one man’s genitals were in direct contact \nwith the next man’s buttocks; \nc.  Whether Defendants violated the constitutional rights of the \nprisoners by violently forcing their heads into the backs of the prisoners ahead of \nthem in line; and \nd.  Whether forcing prisoners to stand in stress positions for several \nhours constituted cruel and unusual punishment. \n36 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY-SCW   Document 197   Filed 10/31/16   Page 37 of 51   Page ID #2383\n65.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the Class.  Mr. Ross was a \nprisoner at Illinois River, Mr. Tolliver and Mr. Smith were prisoners at Menard, Mr. \nHamilton and Mr. Watts were prisoners at Big Muddy, and Mr. Verser and Mr. \nDunmore were prisoners at Lawrence.  All were subjected to the abusive and \ninhumane shakedown executed by Defendant Orange Crush Officers.  Their \ntreatment during the shakedown in late April 2014 is typical of other prisoners \nthroughout Illinois River, and at the other facilities where the Orange Crush team \nconducted these abusive shakedowns.  They seek to prove that the tactics employed \nby Defendants in conducting the shakedown violated the constitutional rights of the \nClass, and to obtain an injunction prohibiting Defendants from inflicting that abuse \nduring future searches. \n66.  Demetrius Ross, Jonathan Tolliver, Kevin Hamilton, Glen Verser, \nZachary Watts, James Dunmore, and Ronald Smith will fairly and adequately \nrepresent the interests of the Class.  They have retained skilled counsel with \nexperience in class actions, and constitutional and prisoners’ rights litigation. \n67.  The questions of law and fact common to the Class predominate over \nany individual issues.  In addition, a class action would be the fairest and most \nefficient way to adjudicate the Class members’ claims. \nCOUNT I \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – Cruel & Unusual Punishment (Eighth Amendment) \n \n68.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully \nrestated here. \n37 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY-SCW   Document 197   Filed 10/31/16   Page 38 of 51   Page ID #2384\n69.  As described more fully above, Defendants inflicted unnecessary \nphysical and emotional pain and suffering on Plaintiffs and other prisoners \nsimilarly situated to him.  They did so intentionally, wantonly, and/or with malice. \n70.  Alternatively, Defendants knew the risk of harm that their misconduct \nposed to those prisoners and nevertheless acted with deliberate indifference in \nexecuting the shakedowns at Illinois River, Big Muddy River, Lawrence, and \nMenard. \n71.  As a result of Defendants’ unjustified and unconstitutional conduct, \nPlaintiffs and other prisoners similarly situated to him suffered pain, emotional \ndistress, and injuries. \n72.  The misconduct described in this Count was undertaken intentionally, \nwith malice, and/or with reckless indifference to the rights of Plaintiffs and other \nprisoners similarly situated to them. \n73.  The injuries of Plaintiffs and other prisoners similarly situated to them \nwere proximately caused by the policies and practices of the IDOC Defendants. \n74.  On information and belief, Defendant Orange Crush Officers executed \ntheir unconstitutional and cruel shakedown at Illinois River pursuant to a policy or \npractice implemented and overseen by Defendant Yurkovich and other IDOC \nsupervisors regarding shakedowns at IDOC facilities.  Accordingly, Defendant \nYurkovich, who was responsible for supervision and oversight of the Orange Crush \nteam, directly encouraged the very type of misconduct at issue in this case, failed to \nprovide adequate training and supervision of Defendant Orange Crush Officers, and \n38 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY-SCW   Document 197   Filed 10/31/16   Page 39 of 51   Page ID #2385\nfailed to adequately punish and discipline prior instances of similar misconduct.  In \nthis way, Defendant Yurkovich violated the rights of Plaintiffs, and other prisoners \nhoused at Illinois River, Big Muddy River, Lawrence, and Menard by maintaining \nand implementing policies and practices that were the moving force driving the \nforegoing constitutional violations. \n75.  On information and belief, Defendants Greg Gossett, Zach Roeckeman, \nStephen Duncan, Kim Butler, and Joseph Yurkovich had notice of widespread \npolicies and practices of Defendant Orange Crush Officers and other members of the \nOrange Crush team, pursuant to which prisoners were subjected to unconstitutional \nand tortious acts of violence and humiliation, as described more fully above.  \nDespite knowledge of these problematic policies and practices, Defendants Gossett, \nRoeckeman, Duncan, Butler, and Yurkovich did nothing to ensure that the \nprisoners at their facilities were treated humanely and in accordance with the \nrights afforded to them by the United States Constitution.  These widespread \npolicies and practices were allowed to flourish because Defendants Gossett, \nRoeckeman, Duncan, Butler, and Yurkovich directly encouraged the very type of \nmisconduct at issue in this case, and failed to provide adequate training and \nsupervision of Orange Crush team members.  In this way, Defendants Gossett, \nRoeckeman, Duncan, Butler, and Yurkovich violated the rights of Plaintiffs, and \nother prisoners similarly situated to them, by maintaining and implementing \npolicies and practices that were the moving force driving the foregoing \nconstitutional violations. \n39 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY-SCW   Document 197   Filed 10/31/16   Page 40 of 51   Page ID #2386\n76.  The above-described policies and practices were able to exist and thrive \nbecause Defendants Gossett, Roeckeman, Duncan, Butler, and Yurkovich were \ndeliberately indifferent to the problem, thereby effectively ratifying it. \n77.  The injuries of Plaintiffs and those similarly situated to them were \ncaused by employees of the IDOC, including but not limited to the individually \nnamed Defendants, who acted pursuant to the foregoing policies and practices in \nengaging in the misconduct described in this Count. \n78.  Defendants continue to this day to perform shakedowns at IDOC \nfacilities, including Illinois River, Big Muddy River, Lawrence, and Menard, using \nthe unconstitutional and cruel methods described more fully above.  Accordingly, \nPlaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated to him, seek \ninjunctive relief from this Court to stop the continuing constitutional violation. \n79.  Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all similarly situated prisoners, \nalso seek actual and punitive damages. \nCOUNT II \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – Conspiracy \n \n80.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully \nrestated here. \n81.  Defendants reached an agreement among themselves to deprive the \nprisoners housed at Illinois River, Big Muddy River, Lawrence, and Menard \n(including Plaintiffs) of their constitutional rights and to protect one another from \nliability for depriving the prisoners of their rights, all as described in the various \nparagraphs of this Complaint. \n40 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY-SCW   Document 197   Filed 10/31/16   Page 41 of 51   Page ID #2387\n82.  In furtherance of the conspiracy, each of the co-conspirators committed \novert acts and was an otherwise willful participant in joint activity. \n83.  The misconduct described in this Count was undertaken intentionally, \nwith malice, and/or with reckless indifference to the rights of Plaintiffs and other \nprisoners similarly situated to them. \n84.  As a direct and proximate result of the illicit prior agreement \nreferenced above, the rights of the prisoners at Illinois River, Big Muddy River, \nLawrence, and Menard (including Plaintiffs) were violated and they suffered \ninjuries, including pain, suffering, and emotional distress.  \n85.  These injuries were caused by employees of the IDOC, including but \nnot limited to the individually named Defendants, who acted pursuant to the \npolicies and practices described above. \n86.  Defendants continue to this day to conspire to deprive Plaintiffs, and \nother prisoners similarly situated to them, of their constitutional rights and to \nprotect one another from liability for the deprivation of those rights, all as described \nin the various paragraphs of this Complaint.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs, on behalf of \nthemselves and all others similarly situated to them, seek injunctive relief from this \nCourt to stop the continuing constitutional violation. \n87.  Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all similarly situated prisoners, \nalso seek actual and punitive damages. \n \n \n41 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY-SCW   Document 197   Filed 10/31/16   Page 42 of 51   Page ID #2388\nCOUNT III \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – Failure to Intervene (Eighth Amendment) \n \n88.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully \nrestated here. \n89.  As described more fully above, Defendants each had a reasonable \nopportunity to prevent the violation of the constitutional rights of the prisoners \nhoused at Illinois River, Big Muddy River, Lawrence, and Menard (including \nPlaintiffs) as set forth above had they been so inclined.  They failed to do so. \n90.  Defendants’ actions were undertaken intentionally, with malice, and/or \nwith reckless indifference to the rights of the prisoners housed at these facilities. \n91.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ misconduct, the rights \nof Plaintiffs, and other prisoners similarly situated to them, were violated and they \nsuffered injuries, including pain, suffering, and emotional distress. \n92.  Plaintiffs’ injuries, and the injuries of those prisoners similarly \nsituated to them, were caused by employees of the IDOC, including but not limited \nto the individually named Defendants, who acted pursuant to the policies and \npractices described more fully above. \n93.  Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all similarly situated prisoners, \nseeks actual and punitive damages for Defendants’ violation of the constitutional \nrights of the prisoners at Illinois River, Big Muddy River, Lawrence, and Menard. \n   \n42 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY-SCW   Document 197   Filed 10/31/16   Page 43 of 51   Page ID #2389\nCOUNT IV \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 – Prison Rape Elimination Act1 \n \n94.  Plaintiffs incorporates each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully \nrestated here. \n95.  By executing and encouraging the shakedowns described more fully \nabove, Defendants have violated and continue to violate several provisions of the \nPrison Rape Elimination Act National Standards, 28 C.F.R. § 115, promulgated by \nthe United States Attorney General pursuant to the Prison Rape Elimination Act, \n42 U.S.C. § 15607. \n96.  Defendants have conducted and continue to conduct cross-gender strip \nsearches of Plaintiffs and all similarly situated prisoners, in violation of 28 C.F.R. \n§ 115.15.  There are no exigent circumstances present during these shakedowns to \njustify cross-gender strip searches. \n97.  Despite several prisoners’ repeated reports of the sexual abuse and \nharassment that they have suffered and continue to suffer, Defendant Baldwin \nrefuses to conduct any administrative or criminal investigation into the misconduct \ncommitted by Defendant Orange Crush Officers, in violation of 28 C.F.R. §§ 115.22 \nand 115.71. \n98.  On information and belief, Defendant Baldwin has failed and \ncontinues to fail to provide adequate training to Defendants and other IDOC staff \n                                                 \n1  Pursuant to Rule 11(b)(2), counsel recognizes that the Court previously dismissed this count in \nits order of January 28, 2016 (Dkt. No. 76). Counsel believes that there is a non-frivolous \nargument for reversing the Court’s ruling, and therefore repleads this count to preserve it for a \npossible future appeal. \n43 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY-SCW   Document 197   Filed 10/31/16   Page 44 of 51   Page ID #2390\non any IDOC policy prohibiting sexual abuse and sexual harassment, in violation of \n28 C.F.R. § 115.31. \n99.  Defendant Baldwin refuses to provide a proper channel for prisoners to \nreport the sexual abuse and harassment that they suffer to any public or private \nentity not part of the IDOC, in violation of 28 C.F.R. § 115.51.  He similarly refuses \nto provide a proper channel for prisoners to report that sexual abuse and \nharassment privately within the IDOC. \n100.  Instead, when prisoners like Plaintiffs complain about the sexual \nabuse and harassment that they are suffering, their complaints are referred to the \nsame Defendants who perpetrated the abuse and harassment, in violation of 28 \nC.F.R. § 115.52. \n101.  On information and belief, none of the Defendants has been disciplined \nfor the sexual abuse and harassment that they perpetrated on Plaintiffs and other \nprisoners subjected to the same sexual abuse and harassment, in violation of 28 \nC.F.R. § 115.76. \n102.  Plaintiffs and other prisoners similarly situated to them have been \ndenied access to medical care, in violation of 28 C.F.R. § 115.82. \n103.   In sum, Defendant Baldwin has grossly failed to protect prisoners like \nPlaintiffs from the sexual abuse and harassment that they have suffered and \ncontinue to suffer at the hands of the Orange Crush team.  This abuse is precisely \nthe same type of misconduct that the Prison Rape Elimination Act sought to \neliminate.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly \n44 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY-SCW   Document 197   Filed 10/31/16   Page 45 of 51   Page ID #2391\nsituated to him, seek injunctive relief from this Court to require Defendants to \ncomply with the Prison Rape Elimination Act National Standards. \nCOUNT V \nIntentional Infliction of Emotional Distress \n \n104.  Plaintiffs incorporate each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully \nrestated here. \n105.  In the manner described more fully above, Defendants engaged in \nextreme and outrageous conduct.  Those actions were rooted in an abuse of power or \nauthority. \n106.  Defendants’ actions as set forth above were undertaken with intent or \nknowledge that there was a high probability that the conduct would inflict severe \nemotional distress and with reckless disregard of that probability. \n107.  Defendants’ actions as set forth above were undertaken intentionally, \nwith malice, and/or with reckless indifference to the rights of the prisoners housed \nat Illinois River, Big Muddy River, Lawrence, and Menard. \n108.  The misconduct described in this Count was undertaken by \nDefendants within the scope of their employment. \n109.  As a direct and proximate result of this misconduct, Plaintiffs, and \nother prisoners similarly situated to them, experienced injuries, severe emotional \ndistress, and suffering. \nWherefore, Plaintiffs, Demetrius Ross, Jonathan Tolliver, Kevin Hamilton, \nGlen Verser, Zachary Watts, James Dunmore, and Ronald Smith, on behalf of \nthemselves and all others similarly situated, respectfully request that this Court \n45 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY-SCW   Document 197   Filed 10/31/16   Page 46 of 51   Page ID #2392\nenter a judgment in his favor and against Defendants Robert Adams, Rachelle \nAiken, Steve Albrecht, Richard Allen, Ashley Alvey, Jeremy Alwerdt, Nathan \nAnderson, Pat Anderson, Khorey Anderton, Brendan Ankrom, Charles Antry, \nRobert Arnett, Sarah Arnett, Michael Atchison, Bradley Ausbrook, Mike Austin, \nBrian Bailey, Bryan Bailey, Gene Bailey, Ryan Bailey, Shawn Bailliez (aka Balliez), \nChris Barber, Mike Baughman, Stephen Bayer, Dustin Bayler, Derek Baylon, \nRandy Baylor, Stephanie Beasley, Chad Belcher, James Berry, Nathan Berry, Paul \nBlacwell (aka Blackwell), Robert Blackwell, David Bogart, Jimmy Bonner, Andrew \n(“Andy”) Bottrell, Tim Bowen, Mark Bower, Mike Bowers, Larry Boyd, Stephen \nBoyle, Hubert Brace, Christopher Brant, Scott Britton, David Brock, Kyle Brooks, \nBud Brown, Douglas Brown, Kenny (“Kenneth”) Brown, David Browning, Chris \nBrubaker, James Bruce, Dennis Bucco, Zachariah Buchanan, Zachary Buchenau, \nJeff Bundren, John Burrow, Jon Burrow, Jonah Butler, Kim Butler, Christopher \nCales, Aaron Campbell, Matt Cannon, Janet Carle, Chase Caron, Bill Carroll, \nFredrick (“Fred”) Carter, Jarrod Carter, Kevin Cartwright, Derrick Caudle, Mike \nChekevida, John Chenault Jr., Tod Childers, Trevor Chitwood, James Cissell, \nBradley Clark, Mike Clark, Ethan Clary, Vincent Cogdal, Charles Compton, Nick \nConklin, Steven Conrad, Timothy Conrad, Adrian Corley, DaWayne Cotton, Nathan \nCourtright, Angela Craddock, Joe Curry, Josh Curry, Jason Dams, Benny (“Benn”) \nDavis, Randy Davis, Ryan Davis, Troy Davis, Elliot Daymon, Michael Dean, Matt \nDees (aka Dess), Rene DeGroof, Drew Derenzy, Rod Dial, Dwight Dilg, Micah \nDillon, Samuel Dillon, Justin Dircks, Vince Diveley, Samuel Dixon, Kyle Donjon, \n46 \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY-SCW   Document 197   Filed 10/31/16   Page 47 of 51   Page ID #2393\nRobert Dorethy (aka Dorety), Wes Dothager, Terry Douglas, Brian Dowdy, Jerry \nDronenberg, Brad Duckworth, Ryan Dumstroff (aka Dumstorff), Stephen Duncan, \nMica Dunn, Mike Dunning, Dwayne Durham, Daniel Dust, Bryan Easton, Scott \nEbers, Justin Eckelberry, Olin Eldridge, Lisa Ellinger, Blake Elliot, Justin \nEngelage, Wesley Engelage, David English, Frank Eovaldi, Steven Estes, Tim \nFeurer, Keneth (“Kenneth”) Finney, Paul Fletcher, M.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS \n \nDEMETRIUS ROSS, on behalf of himself and   \nall others similarly situated,   \n   \nPlaintiff,   \n  Case No. 15-cv-309-SMY-PMF \nvs. \n \nGREG GOSSETT, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \nORDER \n \n  This matter is before the Court on Defendant Chris White’s Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 66) \nin which he incorporates by reference the arguments set forth in the memorandum previously \nfiled at Doc. 47.   Plaintiff responded (Doc. 67) and incorporated the memorandum previously \nfiled at Doc. 59.  For the following reasons, the motion is DENIED. \nBackground \n  Plaintiff Demetrius Ross, an inmate at Illinois River Correctional Center, claims that in \nlate April 2014 the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) Special Operations Response \nTeam, commonly known as “Orange Crush”, conducted a shakedown of cells for the sole \npurpose of causing humiliation and pain, in violation of the Eighth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. § \n1983.  He has filed suit on behalf of himself and “all others similarly situated”.   \nIn his Complaint, Plaintiff makes the following allegations.  On the date in question, \nOrange Crush officers entered each wing of the facility yelling loudly and making “whooping” \nnoises while hitting their batons on walls, tables, doors and railings.  The officers ordered \ninmates to “get asshole naked”, turn around, bend over and spread their buttocks in front of the \nofficers (some of whom were female).  Next, inmates were ordered to turn around and face the \n\nofficers, lift their genitals and  open their mouths with their fingers.  Inmates who asked to wash \ntheir hands before putting them into their mouths were told to “shut the fuck up” and were \nthreatened with segregation if they did not comply.  Inmates were not allowed to put on \nunderwear when redressing. \n  After the strip search, officers ordered the inmates to face the wall and keep their heads \ndown.  The inmates were then handcuffed behind their backs with the palms of their hands \nfacing outward and their thumbs pointed upward (regardless of whether inmates had a “front-\ncuff” permit for medical reasons).  This was a particularly painful handcuff position and the \nhandcuffs were extremely tight.  Any complaints by inmates or requests for medical staff were \nmet with threats of segregation and orders to “shut the fuck up” and “keep [your] fucking head \ndown!” \n  Officers then ordered the inmates to line up and keep their heads down.  Officers lined up \nnext to prisoners, hit their batons in their hands and chanted “punish the inmate” for several \nminutes.  Officers then grabbed the back of each inmate’s head and slammed it violently into the \nback of the prisoner in front of him.  The inmates were ordered to stand in such a way that their  \ngenitals were in direct contact with the buttocks of the inmate ahead of them—a position known \nas “nuts to butts.”  Plaintiff’s head was slammed down so violently that his glasses were broken \nand he became dizzy and lightheaded. \n  Once the inmates were in the “nuts to butts” position, officers shoved their batons \nbetween each inmate’s legs and jerked upwards, forcing the inmate to straighten his legs while \nkeeping his back bent at a 90-degree angle onto the inmate in front of him.  The inmates were \nforced to hold this formation and to keep their genitals and buttocks in contact with the inmates \nin front and behind them while being marched from the housing wings to the gym. The march \n2 \n \n\nwas long and painful.  If an inmate raised his head, officers would either slam his head back \ndown or violently yank him from line, choke him and pull him to the ground.   \nAt the gym, inmates remained handcuffed and were forced to face the wall with their \nheads down and to remain in this “stress position” for several hours.  Defendant Albrecht1 stayed \nin the gym with the inmates.  During this time, he yelled at the inmates, “This is punishment for \nall your sins!”  He instructed the inmates not to ask for water, medical attention or to use the \nbathroom.  After several hours, inmates were again marched in “nuts to butts” formation back to \ntheir housing wing.  During the marches to and from the gym, officers laughed at and taunted the \ninmates. \nUpon returning to their cells, inmates found that they had been “tossed” and that non-\ncontraband items such as items purchased from the commissary and legal documents had been \nseized.  Required “shakedown slips” which are intended to provide documentation of seized \nproperty were either not provided to the inmates or were inaccurate.  Officers’ names were \nobscured on the slips to conceal the identity of those who participated in the shakedown.  When \ninmates requested to see the warden, the officers laughed.  As a result of the shakedown, inmates \nsuffered physical injuries as a result of the shakedown, including back pain, neck pain, blurred \nvision, headaches, dizziness and lightheadedness.  They were denied medical attention and told \ninstead to file a grievance.   \nOrange Crush officers carried out the same shakedown at other IDOC facilities including \nMenard (early April 2014), Big Muddy River (May 2014) and Lawrence (July 2014).  The \nshakedowns were executed pursuant to a policy implemented by IDOC supervisors including \nDefendants Yurkovick (Chief of Operations for IDOC) and Wardens Gossett, Roeckeman, \n                                                           \n1 Plaintiff names Steven Albrecht as a defendant, but uses the name “Albright” on page 16 of the Complaint.  No \ndefendant “Albright” has otherwise been named.  Accordingly, the Court infers that the allegations on page 16 \nrefer instead to Defendant Albrecht. \n3 \n \n\nDuncan and Butler.  Inmates continue to be subjected to the shakedown procedure described \nabove.  Plaintiff brings Eighth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims for cruel and unusual \npunishment (Count I), conspiracy (Count II), failure to intervene (Count III), violation of the \nPrison Rape Elimination Act (Count IV) and intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count \nV).  \nDiscussion \n  Defendant requests general dismissal of the Eighth Amendment and § 1983 claims for \nfailure to state a claim pursuant to F.R.C.P. 12(b)(6).  Specifically, Defendant contends that \nPlaintiff’s Complaint fails to describe any individual who may be responsible for the alleged \nconduct with reasonable particularity and instead, seeks to hold all 236 named individuals jointly \nliable.  Defendant also moves for specific dismissal of Count II pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for \nfailure to adequately state a claim for conspiracy.   \nWhen reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court must accept all allegations \nin the Complaint as true.  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)). The federal system of notice pleading requires only that a \nplaintiff provide a “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to \nrelief.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  However, the allegations must be “more than labels and \nconclusions.” Pugh v. Tribune Co., 521 F.3d 686, 699 (7th Cir. 2008).  This requirement is \nsatisfied if the complaint (1) describes the claim in sufficient detail to give the defendant fair \nnotice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests and (2) plausibly suggests that the \nplaintiff has a right to relief above a speculative level. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555; see Ashcroft v. \nIqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009); EEOC v. Concentra Health Servs., 496 F.3d 773, 776 (7th \nCir. 2007). “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows \n4 \n \n\nthe court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged.” Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556).   \n  Here, Plaintiff acknowledges that he cannot yet identify which officers were present at \nwhich housing units, “primarily because Defendants purposefully concealed their identities to \nevade responsibility for their misconduct…” (Doc. 59, p. 14).  However, Plaintiff argues that it is \npermissible under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to plead allegations regarding \ndefendants’ conduct as a group pending pretrial discovery.  Plaintiff further argues that it is \nsufficient at this stage to allege that every officer used excessive force against one class member \nand that each Defendant failed to intervene.  The Court agrees.   \nCorrectional officers may not benefit from a plaintiff’s inability to identify particular \nofficers who were involved in an alleged violation of inmate rights.  Fillmore v. Page, 358 F.3d \n496 (7th Cir. 2004) (reversing a dismissal of claims where the prisoner plaintiff had been unable \nto identify defendants and remanding for finding of facts).  As the Seventh Circuit Court has \nnoted, “[I]dentification of the responsible party may be impossible without pretrial discovery.”  \nBillman v. Indiana Dep't of Corr., 56 F.3d 785, 789 (7th Cir. 1995).  Accordingly, at this \njuncture, Plaintiff’s inability to identify individual defendants is not grounds for dismissal. \n  Defendant’s argument for dismissal of Count II likewise fails.  Twombly does, as \nDefendants correctly state, require more than a bare assertion of conspiracy.   Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 566 (2007).  “Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to \nrelief above the speculative level” (Id at 555) and must plausibly suggest an agreement between \nthe defendants (Id at 557).   However, Twombly does not limit  the Court’s examination of the \nsufficiency of the allegations to those within the conspiracy count alone.  Rather, the Court may \nlook to the allegations of the Complaint in its entirety in making its determination.   Here, the \n5 \n \n\nCourt finds that the allegations as a whole plausibly suggest an agreement between the \ndefendants and, are therefore sufficient to survive Defendant’s 12(b)(6) motion. \n  Next, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff lacks standing to bring claims arising from the \nalleged shakedowns at facilities other than Illinois River and therefore, dismissal is appropriate \npursuant to F.R.C.P. 12(b)(1).   The Seventh Circuit has addressed the ability of a plaintiff to \nbring an action under these circumstances and held, “If all the defendants took part in a similar \nscheme that was sustained either by a contract or conspiracy,… it is appropriate to join as \ndefendants even parties with whom the named class representative did not have direct contact” \npursuant to the juridical link doctrine.  Payton v. Cnty. of Kane, 308 F.3d 673, 679 (7th Cir. \n2002) (emphasis in original).  As the Court has determined the allegations of conspiracy are \nsufficient to plausibly suggest an agreement between the defendants, consistent with Payton, \ndiscovery with respect to class certification issues is necessary before the Court may properly \nassess the standing of the putative class representative.   Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Complaint \nsurvives 12(b)(1) dismissal at this stage.  \nFinally, Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s intentional infliction of emotional distress \nclaim is barred by sovereign immunity and because the Illinois Court of Claims has exclusive \njurisdiction to hear claims against the state, this Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s state law \nclaim.   However, [A] state employee's sovereign-immunity defense does not impact a federal \ncourt's jurisdiction over a case.”  Fields v. Wharrie, 672 F.3d 505, 518 (7th Cir. 2012) (citing \nRodriguez v. Cook County, Illinois, 664 F.3d 627 (7th Cir.2011)).  Therefore, the Court will not \ndismiss Count V for lack of jurisdiction.  Additionally, “Sovereign immunity affords no \nprotection… when it is alleged that the State’s agent acted in violation of statutory or \nconstitutional law or in excess of his authority….”Healy v. Vaupel, 548 N.E.2d 1240,1247 (Ill. \n6 \n \n\n1990).  As Plaintiff’s Complaint specifically alleges Defendant acted in violation of \nconstitutional law, dismissal of Count V is not substantiated.   \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendant’s motion is DENIED in its entirety.  \n \n \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDATE: January 28, 2015          s/  Staci M.

The RTAs seek \nadmissions about staffing levels and the specific shakedown tactics planned for and used \nduring  the  April  2014  shakedowns  at  Menard  and  Illinois  River,  the  May  2014 \nshakedowns at Big Muddy, and the July 2014 shakedowns at Lawrence (see Docs. 550-1; \n550-2). The RTAs also seek admissions about any investigations conducted and discipline \nimposed as a result of the shakedowns and the alleged loss of video recordings that \ncaptured the shakedowns (see Docs. 550-1; 550-2).  \nNotably,  the  RTAs  come  after  Defendants  have  already  answered  224 \nPage 1 of 5 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 554   Filed 12/04/20   Page 2 of 5   Page ID #21653\ninterrogatories and 54 requests to produce and all 22 Defendants have been deposed—\nmany for well over seven hours. And all 178 RTAs were issued to each Defendant, even \nthough Plaintiffs’ counsel was well-aware that they were not all applicable to each \nDefendant. For example, Plaintiffs’ counsel knows that only two of the 22 Defendants were \npresent at the shakedown in April 2014 at Illinois River, but they nevertheless sent RTAs \npertaining to that shakedown to all 22 Defendants (see Docs. 550-1, 550-2).  \nDefense counsel objected to the RTAs, asserting they were too numerous, were not \ntailored in manner and scope, and sought admissions on topics that had already been \ncovered in earlier depositions (Doc. 550, p. 2; Doc. 551, p. 2; Doc. 551-1). Plaintiffs’ counsel \nrefused to budge. But then a day later, in what Plaintiffs interestingly characterize as an \nattempt to “compromise” (Doc. 551, p. 2), Plaintiffs’ counsel proposed that defense \ncounsel go through the deposition transcripts for all 22 Defendants (some of which are \n300 or 400 pages) to see if any of the 178 RTAs had already been addressed, provide \ncitations for that testimony, and then they would “consider” whether to forego a response \nto that RTA by that specific Defendant (Doc. 551-1). As defense counsel points out, this \nso-called compromise imposed more of a burden than simply answering the RTAs (Doc. \n550,  p.  5).  Unable  to  reach  any  type  of  workable  solution  with  Plaintiffs’  counsel, \nDefendants filed the instant motion seeking a protective order relieving them of any \nobligation to respond to the RTAs. In response, Plaintiffs’ counsel once again refuses to \nbudge and steadfastly maintains there is nothing inappropriate about the RTAs they \nserved (Doc. 551). The Court does not see it that way.  \n“Requests to admit should not be excessive in number and, obviously, should \nPage 2 of 5 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 554   Filed 12/04/20   Page 3 of 5   Page ID #21654\nbe tailored in a manner and scope to avoid harassment and improper motive.” Tamas v. \nFamily Video Movie Club, Inc., 301 F.R.D. 346, 347 (N.D. Ill. 2014) (quoting Robinson v. \nStanley, 06 C 5158, 2009 WL 3233909, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 8, 2009)); Rapp v. Laufers, No. 17-\nCV-948-BBC, 2019 WL 121105, at *3 (W.D. Wis. Jan. 7, 2019). \nHere, Defendants have to answer the RTAs separately, which means defense \ncounsel is essentially responding to a total of 3,916 RTAs. Simply put; that is way too \nmany. Furthermore, Defendants contend that almost all of the RTAs are duplicative of \ntestimony already given at the depositions (Doc. 550, p. 3), which Plaintiffs’ counsel does \nnot dispute (see Doc. 551, pp. 9–10). Instead, they simply claim that they are entitled to \ntake depositions and issue RTAs—they don’t have to choose between the two (Id.). But it \nis well-established that parties are not entitled to unreasonably cumulative or duplicative \ndiscovery or to information they previously had ample opportunity to obtain through \ndiscovery. FED. R. CIV. P. 26(b)(2)(C). Here, Plaintiffs’ counsel does not indicate that the \nRTAs are reasonably needed to follow-up on specific issues covered at the depositions or \nto explore specific issues overlooked at the depositions (see Doc. 551). In other words, \nthey made no attempt to illustrate that the RTAs were intended to build upon, rather than \nsimply duplicate, the deposition testimony. \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs’ counsel readily acknowledges the RTAs were not tailored \nto any specific Defendant (Doc. 551, p. 8) (“With a very limited number of exceptions, the \nRequests do not seek information that is specific to any particular Defendant.”). They \nsimply issued all 178 RTAs to all 22 Defendants despite knowing many of the RTAs \nwould  be  outside  any  given  Defendant’s realm of  knowledge. However,  Plaintiffs’ \nPage 3 of 5 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 554   Filed 12/04/20   Page 4 of 5   Page ID #21655\ncounsel apparently does not see this as a problem; they point out that Defendants are \nonly obligated to respond to the RTAs that fall within their personal knowledge (Doc. \n551, p. 9). In other words, Plaintiffs’ counsel expects defense counsel to sift through 178 \nRTAs and pluck out the ones she believes are applicable to each of the 22 Defendants. \nAnd for the RTAs she deems inapplicable, she can simply write something to the effect \nof  “despite  a reasonable inquiry,  Defendant  ____  lacks sufficient knowledge and \ninformation to either admit or deny the Request.” See FED. R. CIV. P. 36(a)(4). It follows \nthat defense counsel will inevitably end up copying and pasting that response hundreds \nupon hundreds of times because Plaintiffs did not take the time at the outset to carefully \ncraft RTAs targeted at specific defendants or even to specify to defense counsel which \nRTAs each Defendant needed to respond to. The burden of tailoring the RTAs is on the \nproponent, not the recipient.   \n  For these reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ Requests to Admit, as currently \nwritten, are improper and the time spent answering the requests by defense counsel \nwould be abusive, unreasonable, and oppressive. Federal Rule 26(b)(2)(c) instructs the \ncourt to limit the frequency or extent of discovery otherwise allowed by the Rules when \nthe discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative; can be obtained from \nsome other source that is more convenient and less burdensome; or if the party seeking \nthe discovery had ample opportunity to obtain the information by discovery in the action. \nRule 26(c) guides the court to issue a protective order when it is necessary to protect a \nparty  or  person  from  annoyance,  embarrassment,  oppression,  or  undue  burden  or \nexpense. The type of approach to discovery demonstrated here is precisely why the \nPage 4 of 5 \n \n \n\nCase 3:15-cv-00309-SMY   Document 554   Filed 12/04/20   Page 5 of 5   Page ID #21656\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure provide for protective orders. \n  In sum, Plaintiffs have propounded an extremely onerous set of RTAs to each \nDefendant in this case and then has steadfastly refused to compromise, narrow the scope \nof the discovery, or come to the negotiating table in any meaningful way. In other words, \nPlaintiffs have taken an all or nothing approach to this discovery dispute. As a result, the \nmotion for protective order (Doc. 550) will be GRANTED and Defendants are excused \nfrom responding to any of the Requests to Admit. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n  DATED: December 4, 2020   \n              s/ Mark A.
