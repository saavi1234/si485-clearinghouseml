    "summary": "<p>This case is the third time the government notified a criminal defendant that the evidence used against him was from a FISA warrantless wiretap. All the cases regarding criminal challenges to warrantless wiretapping are available in the <a href=\"../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&amp;special_collection=5681&amp;ordering=-summary_approved_date\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">criminal cases challenging FISA surveillance</a> special collection.</p>\r\n<p>On September 6, 2011, Agron Hasbajrami, an Albanian citizen and a lawful U.S. permanent resident, was arrested boarding a flight to Istanbul, Turkey, on a one-way ticket. He was indicted two days later by a federal grand jury for providing and attempting to provide material support to terrorists. The government alleged that Hasbajrami provided funds to jihadist groups in Pakistan who had fought American forces in Afghanistan and intended to fly to Pakistan to assist those groups in that fight.</p>\r\n<p>On September 9, 2011, the government moved for Hasbajrami's permanent detention given the seriousness of his crime, the danger he posed to the community, and the risk that he would flee the country using his international connections. The Court granted the motion that same day. On January 26, 2012, a superseding indictment was issued, charging him with four counts of provisions or attempting to provision material support to terrorists.</p>\r\n<p>On April 12, 2012, Hasbajrami pleaded guilty to Count 2 of the indictment. The trial scheduled for July was cancelled and sentencing was set for September 14, 2012; however, a number of extensions were granted and final judgment was entered on January 16, 2013. Counts 1, 3, and 4 were dismissed and Hasbajrami was sentenced to 15 years in prison for Count 2 with a $100 special assessment fee.</p>\r\n<p>On October 23, 2013, Hasbajrami sent a letter to Judge Gleeson, requesting a copy of the sentencing hearing minutes, docket sheets, grand jury transcripts, and criminal complaint. Judge Gleeson ruled that because Hasbajrami was convicted and had given no notice that he intended to appeal his conviction, his right to criminal discovery was \"extinguished\" and he was not entitled to the grand jury transcripts or complaint.</p>\r\n<p>On December 3, 2013, the Court received a letter from Hasbajrami indicating that he had moved to have his sentence and conviction vacated. A new docket for his collateral motion was opened under no. <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/NS-NY-0012-9001.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1:13-cv-06852-JG</a> .</p>\r\n<p>After discovery, Judge Gleeson granted Hasbajrami's motion on October 3, 2014, allowing Hasbajrami to withdraw his guilty plea and open further proceedings. Judge Gleeson noted that Hasbajrami's pro se filing only indicated that he believed the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutionally vague and that the government disclosed new information that changed his case. In September 2011, before the guilty plea, the government indicated that it would use electronic surveillance evidence against Hasbajrami pursuant to FISA. In February 2014, the government disclosed that some of the information it would have used against Hasbajrami in trial, which included foreign intelligence, was obtained by warrantless wire-tapping.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Gleeson allowed Hasbajrami to revoke his guilty plea because he was not sufficiently informed about the facts of his case and thus could not make an intelligent decision about his plea. The government failed to give him proper notice during the plea negotiations of the evidence it intended to use under the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 (FAA). By failing to give such notice, the government effectively implied that it would not use FAA-acquired evidence against him when that is exactly what it intended to do.</p>\r\n<p>On November 26, 2014, Hasbajrami moved to suppress the fruits of FAA surveillance because of the statute's per se unconstitutionality and the government's \"outrageous conduct\" and his post-arrest statements. He also requested the Court's ruling on whether the government violated his Fifth Amendment right to Due Process, an order directing the government to reveal the witnesses it learned of during Hasbajrami's interrogation, an order directing the government to disclose the evidence that is subject to suppression, notice of the expert witnesses it intends to rely upon at trial, and disclosure of Brady/Giglio material and other evidence it intends to use at trial. On December 23, 2014, the government responded.</p>\r\n<p>On February 20, 2015, Judge Gleeson denied Hasbajrami's motion to suppress the fruits of FAA surveillance and said he would issue a full opinion later. The government indicated that it would disclose some of Hasbajrami's requested information. Judge Gleeson set a status conference for February 27 to see if the government would offer the same plea bargain to Hasbajrami as it did back in 2012. The conference was rescheduled and Judge Gleeson denied Hasbajrami's request for discovery.</p>\r\n<p>At the status conference on April 14, 2015, the government indicated that it would not offer the same plea bargain to Hasbajrami and go to trial, which was set for July 13, 2015. However, the parties began plea negotiations anyway, which were apparently successful. On June 26, 2015, the government issued a superseding information, charging Hasbajrami with one count of provisioning or attempting provision material support to terrorists and one count of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists. Hasbajrami pleaded guilty to both counts. On July 15, 2015, Hasbajrami filed a sentencing memorandum requesting 60 months in prison. However, just five days later, Hasbajrami again moved to withdraw his guilty plea, arguing that his attorney forced him into it. On August 6, 2015, Judge Gleeson denied his motion to withdraw his plea and his request for new counsel.</p>\r\n<p>On August 17, 2015, final judgment was entered. Hasbajrami was sentenced to 15 years in prison for Count 1 and one year in prison for Count 2, to run consecutively, for a total of 16 years in prison. He was also charged a $200 special assessment fee and a judicial order for removal to Albania was issued. On August 21, 2015, Hasbajrami appealed his conviction and sentence.</p>\r\n<p>On March 8, 2016, Judge Gleeson released his opinion as to his denial of Hasbajrami's motion to suppress. Judge Gleeson refused to examine Hasbajrami's facial challenge to the FAA and instead focused on Hasbajrami's as-applied challenge. He held that warrantless surveillance against non-U.S. persons is lawful and does not violate the Fourth Amendment and the incidental collection of U.S.-based persons' information in the lawful targeting of foreign individuals does not trigger the warrant requirement. Further, Judge Gleeson held that the collection of this information was reasonable and that the collection of traditional FISA surveillance was lawfully acquired based on a warrant supported by probable cause.</p>\r\n<p>On August 3, 2016, Hasbajrami's case was reassigned to Judge Irizarry.</p>\r\n<p>On April 6, 2017, Judge Irizarry denied Hasbajrami's request for Judge Gleeson's Unredacted Opinion. 2017 WL 3610595. In response, Hasbajrami moved for reconsideration of the denial of his request for the Unredacted Opinion on April 17, 2017. On August 22, 2017, Judge Irizarry denied the motion for reconsideration. 2017 WL 3610518.</p>\r\n<p>On August 25, 2017, Hasbajrami appealed. Arguments were heard by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on August 27, 2018.</p>\r\n<p>On December 19, 2019, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals released their opinion. Judge Gerard E. Lynch held that the Fourth Amendment is implicated when the government performs a search on Section 702 data, and that such a search should be considered \"a separate Fourth Amendment event.\" Therefore, the Second Circuit remanded the proceedings to the district court because there was insufficient information (both in the classified and public record) to determine whether the querying had been reasonable. The court also denied Hasbajrami's request for the unredacted opinion because the limited redacted information \"could not have substantially affected [his] due process rights\" in the appeal. 945 F.3d 641.</p>\r\n<p>In April 2021, the case was reassigned to Judge LaShann DeArcy Hall in the district court. In December 2021, Hasbajrami filed a supplemental memorandum of law to his motion to suppress, asking the court to order the government to disclose to Hasbajrami's security-cleared counsel the materials they had provided to the court in connection with the remand proceedings, and ultimately to grant the motion to suppress. Hasbajrami argued that the questions regarding whether query database-collected evidence was a violation of the Fourth Amendment or tainted lawfully collected evidence could not be answered without knowing what evidence had been collected via querying databases. He stated that, since his initial guilty plea had been the result of \"the government's deliberate failure to disclose the specific nature of its FISA surveillance,\" he had the right to know what surveillance was conducted against him. Hasbajrami also requested that the court suppress the warrantlessly acquired evidence.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court denied the motion to suppress in May 2024, with a written opinion and order to follow. On August 21, 2024, Hasbajrami filed a mandamus petition in the Second Circuit, seeking an order requiring the district court to release its opinion and order so he could appeal. The Second Circuit denied the petition a few months later, on October 9, but stated that Hasbajrami could renew the motion if the district court did not act within 45 days.</p>\r\n<p>On October 23, 2024, Hasbajrami filed (<em>pro se</em>) a habeas petition, seeking to vacate his sentence on the grounds of ineffective counsel (for failing to inform of relevant information, failure to raise issues on appeal, and advising to plead guilty despite evidentiary problems) and prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\r\n<p>The court completed its opinion on the denial of the motion to suppress in December 2024 and published the redacted version on January 21, 2025. 2025 WL 447498. Judge Hall, acknowledging the Second Circuit's determination that querying data after its initial collection and filtering constituted a separate \"Fourth Amendment event,\" determined that, even where the initial interception of a US person's information was lawful (i.e. incidental or inadvertent), the government is not automatically permitted to search amongst the collected data without a warrant, at least as applied to this case. In the absence of a specific exception, the general prohibition on warrantless search applies, because \"to hold otherwise would effectively allow law enforcement to amass a repository of communications under Section 702&mdash;including those of U.S. persons&mdash;that can later be searched on demand without limitation.\"</p>\r\n<p>The court found that several of the government's queries fell under the foreign intelligence exception, which allows for warrantless searches directed \"at a person located in the United States who is reasonably believed to be engaged in clandestine intelligence activities on behalf of a foreign government.\" However, the court found that government had failed to fulfill its burden to show that obtaining a warrant would have impeded their ability to collect \"time sensitive information,\" and therefore the queries were not exempt from the warrant requirement. Judge Hall also noted that, even had the foreign intelligence exception to the warrant requirement applied, the balancing of the \"substantial degree of intrusion with the powerful public interest\" showed that the queries were unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\r\n<p>Despite this, the court noted that exclusion of evidence should be treated as a \"last resort.\" Exclusion was therefore not justified in this case, because the government acted in good faith by following minimization procedures approved by the FISA court, and the queries occurred long before the agents (acting in reasonable reliance of the existing precedent) \"could have been expected to know that querying required a warrant.\" Finally, the court denied Hasbajrami's request for unredacted access to the government's briefing and factual record, holding that disclosure was not warranted under either FISA or the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA).</p>\r\n<p>On March 6, 2025, Hasbajrami appealed the denial of the motion to suppress to the Second Circuit. As of March 20, 2025, the case is ongoing.</p>",

He subsequently pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 16 years in prison as well as removal from the United States. While in detention, documents came to light that had not been previously disclosed by the government. Hasbajrami subsequently filed a motion to suppress evidence collected through warrantless surveillance, which was denied by the district court in March 2016. The Second Circuit subsequently remanded the case, and the district court issued an opinion in January 2025 holding that the warrantless searches had violated the Fourth Amendment, but declining to suppress the evidence.

Hasbajrami,\n             11 Cr. 623 (JG)         \nDear Judge DeArcy Hall:\nThis letter is respectfully submitted as a second supplement to defendant Agron Hasbajrami’s\nPost-Remand Motion for Suppression and Access to Related Discovery (“Initial Memo of Law”)\n(ECF # 191).  No sooner had we filed our February 6, 2023, Supplemental Letter (ECF # 205) to\nalert the Court to the November 1, 2022 publication of a 66-page (with a 16-page Appendix)\nredacted report by the Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) sfor the National Security Agency\n(“NSA”), than we became aware of another report, released publicly December 21, 2022, describing\ncontinuing violations in the administration of Section 702 electronic surveillance, particularly with\nrespect to “backdoor searches,” which are the subject of this remand from the Second Circuit.  See\nUnited States v. Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d 641, 646-47, 672-77 (2d Cir. 2019).  See also Mr.\nHasbajrami’s Initial Memo of Law (“Initial Memo of Law”) (ECF # 191), at 1-2, 27-30.\nIn addition, it is counsel’s understanding, based on Mr. Bachrach’s conversations with\nAssistant United States Attorney Saritha Komatireddy, that neither AUSA Komatireddy nor AUSA\nDavid K. Kessler are assigned to this matter any longer (Mr. Kessler has left the U.S. Attorney’s\nOffice), and that AUSA Sarah Winick is now the AUSA handling the case.  As a result, Mr.\nHasbajrami respectfully proposes that the Court schedule a status conference.  Mr. Hasbajrami’s\ncounsel are available most of May and would do our best to accommodate whatever date is most\nconvenient to this Court.\nI. The Most Recent Report Detailing Section 702 Querying Non-Compliance Issues\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 206     Filed 04/17/23     Page 2 of 16 PageID #: 2801\nHonorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\n           LAW OFFICES OF\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nApril 17, 2023\nPage 2 of 16\nThe  latest  report,  which  remains  partially  redacted,  the  Semiannual  Assessment  of\nCompliance with Procedures and Guidelines Issued Pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Act, Submitted by the Attorney General And the Director of National\nIntelligence (“2020 Joint 702 Assessment”) covering the six months between December 1, 2019, and\nMay 31, 2020 (December 2021), available at https://www.intelligence.gov/assets/documents/702\n%20Documents/declassified/24th-Joint-Assessment-of-FISA-702-Compliance.pdf, issued jointly\nby the Department of Justice’s National Security Division (“NSD”) and the Office of the Director\nof National Intelligence (“ODNI”), is essentially an unclassified audit (with classified materials still\nredacted from the publicly released version) of the Section 702 program as implemented by the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”), and National Security\nAgency (“NSA”) for essentially the first half of 2020.  See also Dell Cameron, “The FBI’s Most\nControversial  Surveillance  Tool  Is  Under  Threat,” Wired,  February  10,  2023  (“FBI’s  Most\nControversial Tool”), available at www.wired.com/story/fbi-section-702/.\nThe 2020 Joint 702 Report explains that, even after a long and persistent history of non-\ncompliance with statutory and constitutional standards (set forth in the Initial Memo of Law (ECF\n#191), at 50-61, 61-82, Mr. Hasbajrami’s Reply (ECF # 201), at 12-15, and in counsel’s February\n6, 2023, letter (ECF #205)), “notwithstanding a focused and concerted effort by Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) personnel to comply with the requirements of Section 702, misunderstandings\nregarding FBI’s systems and FBI’s querying procedures caused a large number of query errors.” \n2020 Joint 702 Report, at 1.  See also id., at 5 (“FBI had a significant number of compliance\nincidents related to querying of Section 702-acquired information”);  FBI’s Most Controversial\nSurveillance Tool (2020 Joint 702 Report “unearthed new examples of the FBI failing to comply\nwith rules limiting access to intelligence ostensibly gathered to protect US national security.  Such\n‘errors,’ they said, have occurred on a ‘large number’ of occasions”).\nWhile “the numbers of FBI query errors, and FBI compliance incidents overall, reported\nduring this reporting period were significantly lower than they have been in the past few reporting\nperiods[,]” 2020 Joint 702 Report, at 1, that was not necessarily the result of improved performance\nby FBI.  Rather, “[b]ecause FBI field office reviews were suspended during a portion of this\nreporting period, incidents that might typically be discovered by NSD during those field office\nreviews were not discovered while the reviews were suspended.”  Id., at 3 (footnote omitted).\nRather, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, “[o]nsite field office reviews were suspended in\nMarch 2020, at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and related travel restrictions in the United\nStates.”  Id., at 3 n.5.  Consequently, “during this reporting period, NSD was conducting field office\nreviews for only a little more than three months.”  Id.  Consequently, “[i]nstead, the joint oversight\nteam conducted reviews of FBl’s application of its targeting and minimization procedures remotely.” \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 206     Filed 04/17/23     Page 3 of 16 PageID #: 2802\nHonorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\n           LAW OFFICES OF\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nApril 17, 2023\nPage 3 of 16\nId., at 11.1  As a result of the suspension of field office reviews “during a portion of this reporting\nperiod, incidents that would typically be discovered by NSD during those field office reviews would\nnot have been discovered while the reviews were suspended.”  Id., at 40 (footnote omitted).\nUltimately, the 2020 Joint 702 Report concluded that \nThe joint oversight team believes that the suspension of NSD’s FBI\nfield office reviews in March 2020 was likely a significant factor in\nthe decrease in identified incidents.[]  Notably, NSD conducted far\nfewer query audits than in past years.  For example, in 2020, NSD\nconducted query audits of only six field offices, whereas NSD\nconducted query audits of 27 field offices in 2019 and 29 field offices\nin 2018.\nId., at 33.\nNevertheless,  even  with  that  dramatically  reduced  oversight,  “NSD  identified  query\ncompliance issues in each field office audited during this reporting period and during calendar year\n2019.”  Id., at 3.  Also, “since NSD resumed remote query reviews in 2021, NSD has continued to\nidentify query compliance incidents in each field office audited.”  Id.  Thus, noncompliance is\npervasive as well as persistent.  See also 43 n. 61 (“[i]n 2018, NSD identified query compliance\nincidents in 26 of 29 field offices audited.  In 2019, query errors were identified in all 27 field offices\naudited, and in 2020, query errors were identified in all six offices audited”).\nII. The Continuing Lack of Compliance with Querying Standards\nThe 2020 Joint 702 Report acknowledges that “[w]hile the number of FBI compliance\nincidents decreased substantially compared to the previous reporting period, this assessment still\nreports a large number of FBI compliance incidents related to querying, and, in particular, FBI’s use\nof ‘batch queries.’”  Id., at 30 (footnote omitted).2  See also id., at 55 (“as with the previous reporting\n1  In addition, “[a]s a result of FBl’s reduced staffing due to the coronavirus pandemic,\nFBI was unable to gather the information necessary to finalize two of the reports before the\nproduction to Congress of the [still classified] Section 707 Report;  the remaining reports were\nsubsequently finalized with the help of FBI and were provided to the congressional committees\nwith subsequent Section 707 reports.”  2020 Joint 702 Report, at 11.\n2  The 2020 Joint 702 Report adds that due to the lack of comprehensive review caused\nby Covid-19 restrictions, “the joint oversight team is unable to evaluate how FBI’s compliance\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 206     Filed 04/17/23     Page 4 of 16 PageID #: 2803\nHonorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\n           LAW OFFICES OF\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nApril 17, 2023\nPage 4 of 16\nperiod, a large majority of [non-compliance] incidents involved querying errors[]”) (footnote\nomitted). CIA non-compliance with respect to minimization and querying procedures increased\nduring the audit period, id., at 45, while NSA incidents decreased.  Id., at 51.3\nThe 2020 Joint 702 Report further concedes that “[e]ven a small number of incidents can\nhave the potential of carrying broader implications, and a small number of actions can result in\nnumerous incidents also having broad implications, as is the case for FBI ‘batch’ querying\nincidents.”  Id., at 31.  Also, as the Report states, “United States persons were also impacted by\nminimization and querying errors during this reporting period,” some of which were detailed in the\nReport, and discussed post, at 13-15.  Id., at 47.4\nwith its querying procedures during this reporting period compares to other reporting periods.” \nHowever, “NSD and ODNI do assess, however, that query issues were a pervasive compliance\nchallenge during the period of time covered by this joint assessment based on the results of\nNSD’s audits conducted during this and prior reporting periods, as well as the results of NSD’s\nremote audits in 2021, which reviewed historical queries conducted throughout 2020.”  Id., at 33\n(emphasis added).  In addition, reliable data analysis remains obscured: “because of the\nimperfections described above, and because FBI query errors are only one factor in the overall\ncompliance incident rate, a period-on-period comparison of the rate will still not provide an\nentirely accurate measure of the increase in FBI query errors.”  Id., at 35 n.52.\n3  Regarding NSA, “[a]s with prior joint assessments, query incidents remain the cause of\nmost compliance incidents involving NSA’s minimization and que1ying procedures.”  2020 Joint\n702 Report, at 52.  For example, during “the previous reporting period, approximately 88 percent\nof incidents of noncompliance with NSA’s minimization and querying procedures involved\nimproper queries[,]” and “[d]uring this reporting period, out of all of NSA’s minimization and\ngue1ying errors, approximately 91 percent involved improper queries, . . .”  Id.\n4  The extent to which Section 702 has swallowed the rest of FISA (and particularly\n“traditional” FISA, see Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 650) is apparent from the data: “In 2021, the\nmost recent year for which data is available, there were more than 230,000 foreign targets of\nSection 702 warrantless surveillance.  By contrast, the government obtained FISA court orders to\neavesdrop on about 300 Americans or noncitizens on domestic soil.”  Charlie Savage, “Security\nAgencies and Congress Brace for Fight Over Expiring Surveillance Law,” The New York Times,\nFebruary 27, 2023, available at https://nyti.ms/3myME26.  See also Elizabeth Goitein, “The Year\nof Section 702 Reform, Part I:  Backdoor Searches,” Just Security, February 13, 2023, at 1,\navailable at bit.ly/3AeQqRD (“a series of recent government reports and FISA Court opinions\nhave demonstrated that Section 702 has become a go-to domestic spying tool for the FBI, and\nthat FBI agents are routinely violating statutory and court-ordered limits on accessing Americans’\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 206     Filed 04/17/23     Page 5 of 16 PageID #: 2804\nHonorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\n           LAW OFFICES OF\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nApril 17, 2023\nPage 5 of 16\nThe precise number of incidents of non-compliance is classified.  As a result, the 2020 Joint\n702 Report expresses the frequency in relative terms.  For example, instances of non-compliance\nrelated to “minimization and querying” constituted 22.7% of the total number of FBI non-\ncompliance incidents.  Id., at 36.5  NSA non-compliance incidents comprised 23% of all instances\nof NSA non-compliance.  Id., at 51.\nIII. None of the Recently Strengthened Protocols and Enhanced Training \nRegimens Were In Effect During the 2011-2012 Period at Issue In This Case\nThe 2020 Joint 702 Report, at 17, as well as a more recent four-page report released by NSD\nin February 2023, describe in detail enhanced training required and more restrictive protocols\nimplemented in an effort to reduce the non-compliance associated with querying, i.e., “backdoor\nsearches,” the processes pertinent to the remand in this case.\nYet none of these measures, which come on the heels of prior efforts, and prior urging from\nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (“FISC”), and which themselves have not yet proven to\nbe successful, were in effect during 2010-2011, the relevant time period herein: i.e., when the\n“backdoor  searches”  were  performed  in  connection  with  the  investigation  that  led  to  Mr.\nHasbajrami’s prosecution.  See also Initial Memo of Law, at 26, 46.\nMoreover, despite the inability of DoJ, NSA, CIA, and ODNI to implement a system that\navoids material non-compliance with respect to the operation of FISA and Section 702, the 2020\nJoint 702 Report nevertheless fails to acknowledge the fundamental problems inherent in the secret,\ninsular, unaccountable environment FISA generally, and Section 702 in particular, inhabit.  See also\nElizabeth Goitein, “The Year of Section 702 Reform, Part I:  Backdoor Searches,” Just Security,\nFebruary 13, 2023, at 6 (“Goitein:  Backdoor Searches”), available at bit.ly/3AeQqRD (“[w]hen\ngovernment officials are not required to show probable cause of criminal activity to a court, it\ndramatically increases the risk that searches will be driven by improper considerations – including\ndata ‘incidentally’ collected under Section 702”).\n5  Non-compliance incidents covered by the Report do not necessarily include every\ninstance, or coincide temporally with the time period of the audit: “Neither the number of\nincidents reported [], nor the FBI query compliance incident rate [], is based on the number of\ncompliance incidents that occurred during a given reporting period.  Rather, each is based on the\nnumber of incidents that were reported to the FISC as compliance incidents during the reporting\nperiod.”  Id., at 44.\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 206     Filed 04/17/23     Page 6 of 16 PageID #: 2805\nHonorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\n           LAW OFFICES OF\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nApril 17, 2023\nPage 6 of 16\nofficials’ conscious or subconscious prejudices or political leanings”).6\nIndeed, as the repeated attempts at reform from within (and by the FISC) themselves\ndemonstrate, they have been unable to halt rampant non-compliance.  See also Robyn Greene, “A\nHistory of FISA Section 702 Compliance Violations,” NewAmerica.org, September 28, 2017,\navailable at https://www.newamerica.org/oti/blog/history-fisa-section-702-compliance-violations/.\nFor example, the 2020 Joint 702 Report asserts at the outset of the “Compliance Assessment\n– Findings” section that “[t]he joint oversight team finds that during this reporting period, the\nagencies have continued to implement their procedures and follow the guidelines in a manner that\nreflects a focused and concerted effort by agency personnel to comply with the requirements of\nSection 702.”  2020 Joint 702 Report, at 30.  See also id. (“[p]rocesses have been put in place to\nimplement these authorities and to impose internal controls for compliance and verification\npurposes”).\nYet,  as  set  forth  in  Mr.  Hasbajrami’s  previous  submissions,  the  documented  record\nestablishes otherwise.  Indeed, even obtaining data has been a challenge, as “[h]ow often the F.B.I.\nsearches for Americans’ information in the 702 repository has been murky,” because FBI “resisted\nmaking an estimate for years, saying that its systems – which allow agents to search many databases\nat once when hunting for data relevant to foreign intelligence or a crime – could not produce a\nreliable number.”  Charlie Savage, “F.B.I. Queries for U.S. Messages Collected Without Warrants\nAre  Said  to  Drop  ‘Dramatically,’”  The  New  York  Times,  March  3,  2023,  available  at\nnyti.ms/3KUe9vl.7\nAs that New York Times article points out, referring to the 2020 Joint 702 Report,\nnotwithstanding the existence of protocols designed to protect Fourth Amendment rights, “F.B.I.\n6  Ms. Goitein is Co-Director of the Liberty & National Security Program at the Brennan\nCenter for Justice at New York University Law School.\n7  As Ms. Goitein points out with respect to the FISC’s requirement that FBI provide data\nregarding queries of U.S. persons like Mr. Hasbajrami, “[t]he FBI failed to comply for over two\nyears, advancing an absurd legal argument that it could satisfy the requirement by simply\ncounting all queries (i.e., including queries of non-U.S. persons).”  Goitein:  Backdoor Searches,\nat 4.  FBI “finally began keeping the required records in 2020 after the FISA Court and FISA\nCourt of Review rejected that argument.”  Id., citing [REDACTED] Memorandum Opinion and\nOrder, (FISC September 4, 2019), at 6-8, available at\nhttps://www.intel.gov/assets/documents/702%20Documents/declassi\nfied/2018_Cert_FISC_Opinion_04Sep19.pdf.\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 206     Filed 04/17/23     Page 7 of 16 PageID #: 2806\nHonorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\n           LAW OFFICES OF\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nApril 17, 2023\nPage 7 of 16\nagents have repeatedly violated those constraints and searched for other purposes, such as vetting\nmaintenance workers or potential informants.”  Id.  See also post, at 13-15.\nGiven the unbroken history of non-compliance with respect to Section 702 querying,\nrepeatedly defying FISC directives and internal guidelines, the need for continual upgrades in\ntraining and monitoring only reinforce the conclusion that the system is broken, and that incremental\nrepair is unavailing, and demonstrably insufficient to protect Fourth Amendment rights.  \nFor instance, the 2020 Joint 702 Report notes that:\nAs part of its efforts to address certain issues causing the large\nnumber of non-compliant queries, in June 2018, and in November\n2019, FBI worked with NSD and ODNI to develop updated guidance\non the query provisions in FBI’s procedures.  \nId., at 17.8\nThe “enhanced training on the query restrictions in FBI’s procedures was designed to address\nmisunderstandings regarding the query standard and how to avoid non-compliant queries.”  Id.  In\naddition, “[m]ore recently, FBI developed training focused on the query provisions in its Section 702\nquerying procedures, including system changes designed to address aspects of the 2018 amended\nquerying procedures.”  Id.\nYet those serial attempts at improving compliance have proven insufficient, as the periodic\namplifications of training and guidance have consistently required subsequent efforts within a short\nperiod of time.  Thus, while the 2020 Joint 702 Report points out that “[a]lthough reported to the\nFISC during this reporting period, some of these query incidents occurred prior to certain remedial\nsteps taken by the FBI in late 2019[,]” id., at 30, additional “corrective measures” were necessary\nonly a year later: “these query incidents occurred prior to the FBI’s implementation in 2021 of\nsignificant corrective measures to prevent the query compliance issues.”  Id.\n8  See also Goitein: Backdoor Searches, at 2 (“it’s doubtful that adding new layers of\ninternal oversight will accomplish much, given the government’s 15-year cycle of violations,\nfollowed by the adoption of new administrative oversight measures, followed by more\nviolations”); id. (“[i]n the words of surveillance expert Julian Sanchez, the FISA Court and the\ngovernment have been engaged in a game of ‘compliance whackamole’”) citing Julian Sanchez,\nRemarks during PCLOB Public Forum on FISA Section 702, January 13, 2023, available at\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZvaimMTqio.\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 206     Filed 04/17/23     Page 8 of 16 PageID #: 2807\nHonorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\n           LAW OFFICES OF\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nApril 17, 2023\nPage 8 of 16\nNSD’s February 28, 2023, four-page report to Congress, “Recent Efforts to Strengthen FISA\nCompliance,” (“Recent Efforts”) February 28, 2023, available at https://www.justice.gov/nsd/page\nfile/1572036/download, catalogs even more recent training and guidance designed to promote the\nrequisite level of compliance.\nIn fact, even after the training and guidance listed above, “[i]n 2021, after the Department\nof Justice (DOJ) and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) identified additional\ncompliance incidents involving the querying of raw FISA information by the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI), FBI worked with DOJ and ODNI to institute remedial measures that have since\nsignificantly strengthened compliance.”  Recent Efforts, at 1.\nAlso, despite historical non-compliance, it was not until August 31, 2020, that DOJ, through\na memorandum, entitled Augmenting the  Internal Compliance Functions of the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation, and issued by then-Attorney General William G. Barr, that FBI was “directed [] to\nestablish an Office of Internal Auditing (OIA) and undertake a variety of auditing, assessment,\ncompliance, and oversight measures applicable to its national security authorities.”  Id., at 2.\nYet, even that was not deemed sufficient, as less than a year later, April 22, 2021, Attorney\nGeneral Merrick B. Garland felt compelled to issue a memorandum, Further Augmenting the\nInternal Compliance Functions of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, “directing the FBI to submit\nto the Deputy Attorney General a detailed work plan regarding its implementation of Attorney\nGeneral Barr’s August 2020 memorandum and to set specific, measurable goals for implementing\neach of the items in the 2020 memorandum.”  Recent Efforts, at 2.\nNor were those memoranda adequate.  In June 2021:\nFBI changed the default settings in the systems where it stores\nunminimized Section 702 information so that FBI personnel with\naccess  to  unminimized  FISA  Section  702  information  need  to\naffirmatively “opt-in” to querying such information. This system\nchange was designed to address the large number of inadvertent\nqueries of unminimized Section 702 information DOJ had identified\nin its reviews, in which FBI personnel did not realize their queries\nwould  run  against  such  collection.  Historically,  users  were\nautomatically  opted-in  to  querying  unminimized  Section  702\ninformation in these databases if they had been authorized to access\nunminimized Section 702 information.\nId., at 2 (emphasis added).\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 206     Filed 04/17/23     Page 9 of 16 PageID #: 2808\nHonorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\n           LAW OFFICES OF\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nApril 17, 2023\nPage 9 of 16\nAlso, in June 2021, “FBI instituted a policy requiring FBI attorney approval prior to\nconducting a “batch job” that would result in 100 or more queries[]” because “[h]istorically, there\nhad been some compliance incidents with the use of this tool that involved a large number of\nqueries.”  Id., at 3 (emphasis added).  See also Initial Memo of Law, at 21-22.\nFurthermore, shortly thereafter, in Fall 2021, \n[A]t  the  direction  of  the  FISC,  the  FBI  modified  its  systems\ncontaining  unminimized  Section  702  information  to  require  a\ncase-specific justification for every query using a U.S. person query\nterm before accessing any content retrieved by such a query from\nunminimized Section 702 information.  Previously, personnel were\npermitted  to  use  a  pre-populated  common  justification,  when\napplicable, for the query.\nId., at 3 (emphasis added).9\nFollowing that operational adjustment, in November 2021 “DOJ, ODNI, and the FBI issued\nnew comprehensive guidance to all FBI FISA users on the proper application of the query rules, and\nin December 2021, the FBI instituted new mandatory training on that guidance, which personnel\nwere required to complete by the end of January 2022.”  Id., at 3.10\nAgain, here, in Mr. Hasbajrami’s case, the Section 702 querying occurred more than a decade\nago in an essentially unregulated, unmonitored, and unaccountable environment, absent any\nmeaningful operational guidance or restrictions being imposed.  Indeed, the reliance on Section 702\nsurveillance in Mr. Hasbajrami’s case occurred before any of the above-listed enhanced training was\n9  Recent Efforts noted that “[t]he reduction in U.S. person queries appears to stem in part\nfrom the implementation of the ‘opt-in’ change, which has not only decreased the number of U.S.\nperson queries overall but has also greatly reduced the number of inadvertent queries of\nunminimized Section 702 information.”  Id., at 4.  Also, “based on DOJ’s recent reviews, FBI\nappears to be conducting fewer ‘batch job’ queries, which has further reduced the number of U.S.\nperson queries.”  Id.\n10  Even the most recent standards adopted by FBI have left ample room for interpretation. \nCompare Tweet, Ellen Nakashima, March 4, 2023, available at bit.ly/43sCQHw (publishing DoJ\nstatement “in response to a request for clarification about FBI personnel’s ability to query the\ndatabase”), and bit.ly/43x8NyA, with Tweet, Elizabeth Goitein, March 6, 2023, available at\nbit.ly/41IkosX.  Ms. Nakashima is a national security correspondent at The Washington Post.\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 206     Filed 04/17/23     Page 10 of 16 PageID #:\n2809\nHonorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\n           LAW OFFICES OF\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nApril 17, 2023\nPage 10 of 16\nimplemented, before any of the guidance was issued, and before any of the restrictive measures were\nimplemented to reduce the number of improper queries of the Section 702 database.11\nIV.  FBI Continues to Disingenuously Attribute Non-Compliance to “Misunderstandings”\nAmong the problems in attaining a level of compliance consistent with  Fourth Amendment\nstandards and the statutory scope of Section 702 (and FISA altogether) itself is the intelligence\ncommunity’s refrain that non-compliance is the result merely of “misunderstandings” by those\ndelegated the responsibility of operating the program(s).  See also ante, at 2,7.12\nFor example, even after an uninterrupted string of non-compliance lasting more than a\ndecade, the 2020 Joint 702 Report claims that “as with the previous incident rate, the current\nreporting period’s overall compliance incident rate was predominantly impacted by FBI personnel\nmisunderstanding the query standard in FBI’s querying procedures.”  2020 Joint 702 Report, at 32\n(emphasis added).  See also id., at 55 (“[m]ost of the querying incidents were caused by personnel\nmisunderstanding the application of the query standard in the context of batch queries”);  id., at 57\n(“[d]uring this reporting period, after batch queries are removed, most of the improper query\nincidents resulted from FBI personnel misunderstanding the querying rules even though the queries\nwere conducted for work-management purposes or work-related purposes”).13\n11  In an illustrative example, “in 2018, Congress required the FBI to show probable cause\nand obtain a court order for a very small subset of U.S. person queries:  those conducted in\npredicated criminal investigations unrelated to national security. (The subset is small in part\nbecause the FBI generally runs U.S. person queries at early stages of the investigation, i.e., before\nthey qualify as “predicated.”).  Goitein: Backdoor Searches, at 5.  Yet, even though “[a]ccording\nto the government’s figures, this requirement to obtain a court order has been triggered on more\nthan 100 occasions since 2018[,]” id., nonetheless, “[b]y the government’s own admission, [] the\nFBI has never once complied with it.”  Id. (emphasis added).\n12  Even when non-compliance “can be traced to a technical issue with how the FBI’s\nsystems display data,” FBI “notably failed to fix [that flaw] for nearly two years.”  Goitein: \nBackdoor Searches, at 5.  Also, “the FISA Court made clear that the violations could not all be\nexplained by this technical issue.”  Id.\n13  The 2020 Joint 702 Report also revealed that notwithstanding the continuing concern\nexpressed during the past decade by the FISC, legislators, academics, and civil liberties\norganizations with respect to indiscriminate querying of the Section 702 database for evidence of\nordinary criminal activity, FBI was nevertheless commingling “non-FISA acquired and\nunminimized FISA-acquired information” in the same database, and running unrestricted queries\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 206     Filed 04/17/23     Page 11 of 16 PageID #:\n2810\nHonorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\n           LAW OFFICES OF\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nApril 17, 2023\nPage 11 of 16\nRecent Efforts again parroted that rationale only weeks ago, contending that the November\n2021  “guidance  and  mandatory  training  directly  address  misunderstandings  about  the  rules\napplicable to queries of unminimized FISA information and instruct personnel on how to properly\napply the query rules.”  Recent Efforts, at 3.  See also id. (“[i]n addition, the text of FBI’s Section\n702 querying procedures was revised to more clearly spell out the query standard to FBI personnel”).\nLikewise, NSA compliance failures have also been ascribed to inadvertence.  For instance,\nin 2011, the FISC “prohibited the NSA from conducting any U.S. person queries of data obtained\nthrough ‘upstream’ collection – a method of Section 702 collection that is more likely to sweep in\npurely domestic communications.  The Court made clear that this prohibition was necessary to\npreserve the constitutionality of the program.”  Goitein:  Backdoor Searches, at 6.  See also Initial\nMemo of Law, at 16-19, 57-61.  \nHowever, “[s]everal years later, the NSA reported to the FISA Court that its agents had not\nbeen complying with this rule.”  Goitein:  Backdoor Searches, at 6.  While NSA “blamed the\nviolations on ‘human error’ and ‘system design issues[,]’ the NSA’s Inspector General found that\n‘the problem was widespread during all periods under review.’” Id., at 6.  Subsequently, in a 2017\nopinion, the FISC “chided” NSA, id., “not only for its failure to comply with the querying\nprohibition, but for its ‘institutional lack of candor’ in failing to timely report the violations.”  Id.,\nciting [Redacted], Mem. Op. (FISA Ct. Apr. 26, 2017), available at https://www.dni.gov/files/docum\nents/icotr/51117/2016_Cert_FISC_Memo_Opin_Order_Apr_2017.pdf.\nThose excuses are tired and insufficient at this point.  See also Gotein:  Backdoor Searches,\nwithin it.  Yet that, too, was attributed simply to a lack of understanding:\nFBI personnel advised that they did not appreciate that queries\nwould be running against unminimized FISA-acquired information\nand, thus, would be subject to the query standard.  This is\nparticularly the case with respect to query incidents that have been\nidentified with queries run in a specific FBI database that contains\nnon-FISA acquired and unminimized FISA-acquired information.\nAs a result, for these queries, FBI personnel did not think to apply\nthe query standard to their proposed queries before conducting\nqueries in that particular FBI database, or failed to opt out of\nconducting queries against unminimized FISA-acquired\ninformation.\nId., at 59 (emphasis added).\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 206     Filed 04/17/23     Page 12 of 16 PageID #:\n2811\nHonorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\n           LAW OFFICES OF\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nApril 17, 2023\nPage 12 of 16\nat 8-9 (“the notion that FBI agents didn’t understand the relevant standard – and that they simply\nneed better training and oversight – is hard to accept when that standard has been in place for at least\n14 years, and when the government has been touting its rigorous training and oversight throughout\nthat period”).\nAs Rep. Darin LaHood (R. – Ill.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee recognized\nin  the  context  of  a  specific  incident  discussed  post,  at  14,  the  2020  Joint  702  Report’s\n“characterization of this F.B.I. analyst’s action as a mere misunderstanding of querying procedures\nis indicative of the culture that the F.B.I. has come to expect and even tolerate.”  Charlie Savage,\n“Lawmaker Says He Was Target of F.B.I. Surveillance Material Searches,” The New York Times,\nMarch 9, 2023 (“Lawmaker Says He Was Target”), available at https://nyti.ms/3GHDvLg.\nIndeed, as Ms. Goitein notes, “[a]s the FISA Court suggested, there’s an alternative\nexplanation for the FBI’s behavior: not just a misunderstanding of the standard, but “indifference\ntoward it.”  Goitein:  Backdoor Searches, at 8, citing In re Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\n[Redacted], 402 F.Supp. 3d 45, 78 (FISA Ct. 2018), aff’d in part sub nom. In re DNI/AG 702(h)\nCertifications 2018, 941 F.3d 547 (FISA Ct. Rev. 2019).\nV.  Oversight by the FISC Remains Inadequate and Insufficiently Transparent\nEven as the 2020 Joint 702 Report – and the numerous reports and FISC opinions beforehand\ndiscussed in Mr. Hasbajrami’s prior submissions – concedes the non-compliance problems attendant\nto Section 702 querying, it also notes that once again, “[t]he FISC ultimately determined that FBI’s\namended querying procedures were adequate[.]”  Id., at 5.\nThe 2020 Joint 702 Report also – again – promises increased oversight, see id., at 6-7\n(devoting an entire section to the subject) without any of the transparency that could genuinely exert\na practical impact on Section 702 querying in a manner that could provide confidence that Fourth\nAmendment and statutory standards were being respected.  Moreover, as Ms. Goitein has pointed\nout:\nAt a more fundamental level, though, oversight – whether internal, in\nthe form of FBI training or audits, or external, in the form of FISA\nCourt review – is not an end in itself;  it is a means to ensure that the\ngovernment  is  following  the  rules.    Where,  as  here,  the  rules\nthemselves have been interpreted to permit warrantless searches of\nAmericans’ private communications, all the oversight in the world\nwon’t solve the problem.\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 206     Filed 04/17/23     Page 13 of 16 PageID #:\n2812\nHonorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\n           LAW OFFICES OF\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nApril 17, 2023\nPage 13 of 16\nGoitein:  Backdoor Searches, at 2.\nRecent Efforts also notes that while the FISC issued an opinion in April 2022, a year later it\nhas not yet been declassified and released publicly.  Recent Efforts, at 4.  Yet Recent Efforts quoted\nfrom it in an effort to convince Congress that the latest measures would achieve compliance:\n[A] recent FISC opinion has recognized the compliance  benefits of\nthe new approach.  As the FISC noted in an April 2022 Section 702\nopinion  that  will  shortly  be  released  by  ODNI,  “the  Court  is\nencouraged by the amendments to the FBI’s querying procedures and\nthe substantial efforts to improve FBI querying practices, including\nheightened documentation requirements, several system changes, and\nenhanced guidance, training, and oversight measures.  There are\npreliminary indications that some of these measures are having the\ndesired effect.”  See Mem. Op. & Order at 49 (FISA Ct. Apr. 21,\n2022).\nId.  See also February 6, 2023, letter, at 10.\nThus, the intelligence community, when it suits its purposes (in this instance the campaign\nfor Section 702’s reauthorization before it expires at the end of 2023), publicly cites a classified\nopinion to which prosecutors have access but which defense counsel cannot yet review.  However, \n“[t]hat opinion remains classified, leaving it unclear whether the court had any criticisms.”   Charlie\nSavage,  “F.B.I.  Queries  for  U.S.  Messages  Collected  Without  Warrants  Are  Said  to  Drop\n‘Dramatically,’” The New York Times, March 3, 2023, available at https://nyti.ms/3GGUHRs.\nVI.  Specific Instances of Non-Compliance Disclosed In the 2020 Joint 702 Report\nSeveral specific instances of non-compliance disclosed in the 2020 Joint 702 Report, at 56-\n62, are disturbing, including “multiple query incidents involving FBI looking for derogatory\ninformation about individuals[,]” and “FBI personnel conducting queries of individuals whom FBI\nwas considering approaching as sources, [REDACTED.]”  Id., at 58.14  Three particular episodes\n14  According to the report covering the previous six months, a specific a batch query\nincluded identifiers for “multiple current and former United States Government officials,\njournalists, and political commentators.”   (U) Semiannual Assessment of Compliance with\nProcedures and Guidelines Issued Pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Act, Submitted by the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence,\nAugust 2021, Reporting Period:  December 1, 2018 – May 31, 2019, available at\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 206     Filed 04/17/23     Page 14 of 16 PageID #:\n2813\nHonorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\n           LAW OFFICES OF\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nApril 17, 2023\nPage 14 of 16\nmerit mention herein.\nFirst, in a footnote, the 2020 Joint 702 Report notes that an intelligence analyst “conducted\napproximately  [REDACTED]  queries  in  [REDACTED]  using  only  the  name  of  a  U.S.\ncongressman.”  Id., at 58 n. 92.  The “specific facts that led the IA to conduct these queries[]” remain\nclassified in a separate report.  Id.  Those queries, deemed “non-compliant,” id., “retrieved\nunminimized FISA-acquired information, including Section 702-acquired products that were\nopened.”  Id.\nDuring a March 2023 Congressional hearing, Rep. LaHood “identified himself as that\nlawmaker.”  Lawmaker Says He Was Target.  Thus, Section 702 served as a vehicle for querying\nwith respect to the legislator serving as “the leader of a bipartisan working group of Intelligence\nCommittee members who are trying to persuade Congress to reauthorize the warrantless surveillance\nlaw in question, known as Section 702.”  Id.15  It is not feasible to chalk up that conduct to any\n“misunderstanding.”16\nSimilarly, “[i]n one query incident, FBI queried the names of a local political party to\ndetermine if the party had connections to foreign intelligence.”   2020 Joint 702 Report, at 58.  Yet\nthat query “was not reasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information.”  Id.\nPredictably, the 2020 Joint 702 Report concluded that both “errors” were the product of a\n“misunderstanding” of FISA authority.  Id., at 58-59.

LaHood, who supports reauthorization of Section 702, nevertheless called  “the\nqueries about communications involving a member of Congress an egregious violation that\nbetrayed trust in government surveillance power and could be ‘seen as a threat to the separation\nof powers.’”  Lawmaker Says He Was Target.\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 206     Filed 04/17/23     Page 15 of 16 PageID #:\n2814\nHonorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\n           LAW OFFICES OF\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nApril 17, 2023\nPage 15 of 16\nAnother set of queries that “NSD determined lacked an authorized purpose[]” involved an\nFBI analyst’s queries in 2016-201717 related to an investigation \nbased on a witness’s report that a vehicle driven by an individual of\nMiddle Eastern descent sped into the parking lot and began honking\nthe horn.

On February 7, 2023 I was informed that the FBI located \n1 \n9,200 pages of records subject to the FOIPA pursuant to my request. Subsequently, on April 20, 2023 I was then \n1  1 \ninformed that the FBI had located 82 568 pages of records subject to the FOIPA. \n1\nThis new information has been disclosed to me after 12 years of my incarceration. The amount of records is \nenormous and shocking. It amounts to 178 pages a day, for 15 months of the investigation( June 2010-Sept. 2011 ). \nAt the time I plead guilty, the government had disclosed in the ballpark of 1,100 pages of discovery. The withholding \nof this enormous trove of information absolutely impaired  my judgement. If I were aware of it, I would have NOT \nplead guilty. \nIf this is the amount the FBI has under the FOIPA, how much more have they retained as classified information ?! \nWere the District and Appellate Courts aware of this enormous amount of records prior to their rulings ?! \nClearly, not. Otherwise the case would have not been remanded. \nHas the government disclosed the same amount of records to the court ?!  Has this court access to this \ntremendous amount of records, not including the classified information, so far ?! This court should not make the \nmistake of ruling on queries without at least, having access to these records. \n1 \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 209     Filed 10/11/23     Page 2 of 8 PageID #: 2821\nTRULINCS  65794053 - HASBAJRAMI, AGRON - Unit: RBK-G-A \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConclusion \nThe withholding of this new information impaired my judgement when I plead guilty and therefore the withdrawal \nof the plea is warranted in this case.

TIMELINESS OF MOTION: If your judgment of conviction became final over one year ago, you must explain \nwhy the one-year statute of limitations as contained in 28 U.S.C. § 2255 does not bar your motion.* \nTHE  ONE-YEAR  STATUTE  OF  LIMITATIONS  AS  CONTAINED  IN \n28  u.s.c.§  2255  DOES  NOT  BAR  PETITIONER'S  MOTION \nBECAUSE  THE  CASE  WAS  REMANDED  BACK  TO  THE  DISTRICT  COURT \nIN  DECEMBER  2019  AND  WAS  JUST  DECIDED  ON \nMAY  1ST,  2024. \n* The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\") as contained in 28 U.S.C. § 2255, \nparagraph 6, provides in part that: \nA one-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section.

On  April  20,  2023,  Petitioner \nbecame  aware  of  the  existence  of  82,568  pages  of  records  subject \nto  the  FOIPA  by  FBI.  Also,  in  April  of  i024,  the  Petitioner  was \n\"INDIRECTLY\"  informed  by  his  attorney  (Dratel)  that  Tehriki \nTaliban  Pak~stan  (TTP)  was_not  designated  a  Foreign  Terrorist \nOrganization  (FTO)  until  September  of  2010.  Moreover,  in  September \nof  2024,·  the  Petitioner,  a  layman  in  law,  became  aware  of \nRule  11(e)(1),  which  was  violated by  court. \nIn  light  of  these  facts,  Petitioner  moves  to  vacate,  set \naside  his  s~ntence  and  conviction  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  2255  on \nthe  grounds  of  Ineffective  Assistance  of  Counsel,  Prosecutorial \nMisconduct  and  Violation  of  Rule  11(e)(1)  by  the  court. \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 215     Filed 10/23/24     Page 14 of 48 PageID #:\n2850\nAccodingly,  Petitioner  respectfully  requests  from  this  court. \nthat  his  2255  motion  be  GRANTED. \nSTATEMENTS  OF  FACTS \n1.)  Petitioner,  Agron  Hasbajrami,  was  arrested  on  September  6, \n2011  and  charged  with  one  count  of  Provision  of  Material \nSupport  to  Terrorist,  in violation  of  18  U.S.C.  §§2339A(a),2. \nSee  Sealed  Indictment,  dated,  September  8,  2011. \n2.)  On  January  26,  2012,  after he  fired  his  attorneys, \nHasbajrami  was  charged  with  three  counts  of  Provision  and \nOne  Count  of  Attempt  to  Provide  Material  Support  to  Terrorists, \nall  in violation of  18  U.S.C.  §§2339A(a),2. \nSee  Superseding  Indictment~S-1). \n3.)  On  April  12,  2012,  Hasbajrami  pleaded  guilty  to  Count  Two \nAttempt  to  Provide  Material  Support  to  Terrorist,  and  Count \nOne,  Three  and  Four  of  indictment  were  dismissed. \n4.)  On  January  8,  2013,  Hasbajrami  was  sentenced  to  15  years  in \nprison  by  Judge  Gleeson. \n5.)  In  July  of  2013,  Hasbajrami  filed  a  2255  Motion. \n6.)  On  February  24,  2014,  the  Government  provided  Hasbajrami \nwith  notice  for  the  very  first  time  that  it had  relied upon \nwarrantless  Section  702  surveillance. \n7.)  On  October  2,  2014,  District  Court  vacated  the  sentenee  in \npart  of  DOJ  policy which  deprived  Hasbajrami  of  his  ability \nto  make  an  intelligent  decision  about  whether  to  plead \nguilty. \n8.)  On  February  20,  2015,  Judge  Gleeson  denied  the  motion  to \nsupress  the  fruits  of  FAA  surveillance. \n1 \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 215     Filed 10/23/24     Page 15 of 48 PageID #:\n2851\n9.)  On  June  26,  2015,  one  day  before  Jury  selection,  Hasbajrami \nentered a  conditional  guilty plea  to  a  two-count  superseding \nIndictment  (SS-2)  charging  him  with  one  count  of  Provision \nand  Attempted  Provision  of  Material  Support  to  Terrorist  in \nviolation  of  18  U.S.C.  §§2339A(a)  and  2,  and  one  count  of \nConspiracy  to  Provide  Material  Support  to  Terrorists  in \nviolation  of  18  U.S.C.  §§371. \n10.)  On  July  20,  2015,  Hasbajrami  filed  a  Motion  to  Withdraw  Plea \nof  Guilt. \n11.)  On  August  6,  2015,  District  Court  denied  the  Motion  to \nWithdraw  Plea  of  Guilt. \n12.)  On  August  13,  2015,  Hasbajrami  was  re-sentenced  to  16  years. \n13.)  Subsequently,  Hasbajrami  filed  the  appeal. \n14.)  On  December  18,  2019,  Second  Circuit  remanded  the  case. \n15.)  On  May  1,  2024,  this  court  denied  Supplemental  Motion  to \nSupress. \n16.)  Now,  Hasbajrami,  in  light  of new  information  he  recently \nbecame  aware  of,  he  moves  to  vacate,  set  aside  his  sentence \nand  conviction pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §§2255  and  respectfully \nasks  this  court  that  his  2255  Motion  be  GRANTED. \nLEGAL  STANDARD \nSecond  Circuit has  held  on  several  occasions  that  \"[A] \ncollateral  attack on  a  final  judgment  in  a  federal  criminal  case \nis  generally  available  under  §§2255  only  for  a  constitutional \nerror,  a  lack of  jurisdiction  in  the  sentencing  court,  or an \nerror of  law  or  fact  that  constitutes'a  fundamental  defect  which \ninherently.  results  in a  complete  miscarriage  of  justice.'\" \n2 \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 215     Filed 10/23/24     Page 16 of 48 PageID #:\n2852\nHill  v.

The  reasons \nfor  a  narrowly  limiting  the  relief  permitted  under  §§2255--a \nrespect  for  the  finality  of  criminal  sentences,  the  efficient· \nallocation  of  judicial resources,  and  an  aversion  to  retrying \nissues  years  after  the  underlying  events  took  place-are  \"well \nknown  and  basic  to  our  adversary  system  of  justice.\" United  States \nv.

Ineffective  Assistance  of  Counsel \nClaims  of  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel  \"may  appropriately \nbe  raised  for  the  first  time  on  Section  2255  Motion,  whether  or \nnot  the  petitioner could  have  raised  the  claim on  direct  appeal.\" \nHarrington  v.

Ineffective  Assistance  of \nCounsel  violates  a  criminal  defendant's  constitutional  [2024 \nU.S.  Dist.

Ct.  1604,  140  L.Ed.2d  828  (1998). \nSeveral  courts  and  commentators  maintain  that  a  prosecutor \nmay~not  withhold  exculpatory  evidence  from  a  defendant  during \nplea  negotiations  on  the  ground  that  such  information  is  vital \n3 \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 215     Filed 10/23/24     Page 17 of 48 PageID #:\n2853\nto  enable  the  defendant  to  intelligently decide  whether  to  plead \nguilty.  Failure  to  disclose  such  evidence  has  resulted  in \nvacating  otherwise  valid  guilty pleas.  Ferrara v.  U.S.,  456  F.3d \n278,  293  (1st  Cir.  2006)  (\"government's  nondisclosure  so \noutrageous  that  it constituted  impermissible  misconduct  sufficient \nto  ground  the  petitioner's  claim  that his  guilty  plea  was \ninvoluntary\");  Bousley  v.  United  States,  523  U.S.  614  (1998) \n0  in  extraordinary circumstances  where  the  defendant  has  been \n(\ninduced  to  plead  guilty by  egregious ... or  other  serious  misconduct \na  court  may  find  that  the  defendant  was  deprived  of  his  ability \nto  plead  guilty voluntarily\"). \nC.  Violation  of  Rule  11(e)(1) \nCourts  that  have  construed Rule  11  have  uniformly held  that \nit means  what  it says:  the  court  shall  not  participate  in  any  plea \nagreement  negotiations.  Accordingly,  when  a  district court  express \nes  its preference  for  or  against  certain plea-bargaining  terms \nin  an  unfinalized  or hypothetical  plea  agreement,  the  court \nimpermissibly  participates  in plea  negotiations  in  violation  of \nRule  11.  In  sum,  Rule  11  contains  a  clear  prohibition  on~judic-\nial  involvement  in  plea  discussions.  See  Diaz,  138  F.3d  at  1363. \n(finding  a  Rule  11  violation  \"because  the  sentencing  judge  took \nan  active  part  in  discussing  [the  defendant's]  probable  sentence \nbefore  the  time  of his  conviction  and  because  she  commented  on \nthe  weight  and  nature  of  the  evidence  against  him\"). \nSection  2255  provides  that  a  district court  should  grant  a \nhearing  \"[u]nless  the  motion  and  the  files  and  records  of  the \ncase  conclusively  show  that  the  prisoners  is  entitled  to  no \nrelief.\"  28  U.S.C.  §§2255(b). \n4 \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 215     Filed 10/23/24     Page 18 of 48 PageID #:\n2854\nARGUMENT \n1)  Ineffective  Assistance  of  Counsel  :  Failure  to  Inform \nAt  the  end  of  April  2024,  upon  Hasbajrami's  request,  he \nreceived  a  copy  of  the  sentencing  memo,  that his  attorney  Dratel \nfiled  on.U.S.  v  Babar  Ahmad  3:04cr301  (JCH)  (U.S.D.C.) \n(Exhibit!). \nAstonishingly,  after 13  years  of  his  incarceration,  in  that \nmemo  he  discovered  that  Tehriki  Taliban  Pakistan  (TTP)  was  NOT  de \nsignated  as  a  Foreign  Terrorist  Organization  (FTO)  until  Sept.  of  2010 \nNotably,  it'~  known  in  the  discovery  pg  42  +  122  that  indivi \ndual  #1  was  affiliated with  TTP,  and  the  investigation  statted \nin  June  of  2010.  (Sealed  Indictment).  The  government's  case  against \nHasbajrami  has  been,  that  it arose  from  an  incidental  wiretap, \nmeaning  that  the  Individual  #1  was  the  main  \"Target\"  of  section \n702  of  FISA. \nThe  fact  is  that  individual #1  was  NOT  and  can  NOT  be  the \n\"Target\"  on  or  prior June  of  2010,  when  his  group:was  NOT  desig \nnated  as  a  FTO  yet~  Also,  it is  a  fact  that  individual  #1  was \nNOT  the  \"Target\"  in beginning  of  2010  (detention  order  doc  #3, \npg  3,  9/9/11)  because  he  was  \"incarcerated\"  in  Turkey  from \nApril  2009  until  January  2010.  (discovery  pg  463-464).  (Exhibit  2). \nUnequivocally,  this  exculpatory  information  debunks  govern \nment~s  long  standing  claim,  and  it asserts  that  Hasbajrami  was \nthe  main  \"Target\"  of  section  702  of  FISA.  Government's  argument \nholds  no  water.  Simply  put, _the  government  has  no  case.  Most \nlikely,  this  is  exactly what  his  ex-lead  attorney  Zissou  meant \nin  sentencing hearing  on  January  8,  2013: \n\"For  all  your  honor  knows,  they had  pr9of  problems, \nthey  had  evidentiary problems,  they  had  legal  problems. \nThe  possibilities  are  endless,  and  I  don't  think  it's \n5 \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 215     Filed 10/23/24     Page 19 of 48 PageID #:\n2855\na  place  where  your  honor  should  go.\"  (sentencing \ntranscript  1-8-13  pg  23) \nWhat  more  \"proof,  evidentary,  legal  problems\"  can  be  than \nthis  one?! --~This  is  none  other  than  a  repeated  \"Failure  to  Inform\" \nof  ineffective  counsel(s).  The  first  time,  occurred  when  they \nfailed  to  inform  him  that: \n\"There  is  information  to  suggest  that  individual  #1 \nwas  not  in  fact  a  terrorist,  and  that  he  solicited \nfunds  from  the  defendant  for  purposes  unrelated  to \nterrorism.\"  (2/6/13  (PSR)). \nprior  to  me  entering  a  plea  agreement  in  2012. \nDesignation  of  TTP  as  a  FTO  it can  easily be  found  in \nDepartment  of  State's  website  or  in  the  motion  my  attorney,  Dratel, \nfiled.  Accordingly,  his  attorney(s)  were  well  aware  of  it and \nfailed  to  inform  him  \"Twice\"  before  the  \"Two  (2)\"  plea  agreements \nthat  he  entered.  Moreover,  this  disclosure  of  information  would \nhave  changed  the  landscape  of  this  case  and  eventually  of  his \nlife.  For  this  reason  they  never  litigated  that  Hasbajrami  was \nthe  main  \"Target\"  of  section  702  of  FISA,  neither  in  District \nCourt  nor  Appellate  court. \nHad  Hasbajrami  known  this  information  he  would  have  never \never  entered  any  plea  agreement.

The  same  is  true here. \n2)  Prosecutorial  Misconduct \nOn  February  7,  2023,  Hasbajrami  was  informed  that  the  FBI \nlocated  9,200  pages  of  records  subject  to  the  FOIPA,  pursuant  to \nmy  request.  Subsequently,  on  April  20,  2023,  he  was  then  informed \nthat  the  FBI  had  located  82,568  pages  of  records  subject  to  the \nFOIPA.  This  information  has  been  disclosed  to  him  after  12  years \nof  his  incarceration.  (Exhibit  3). \nAt  the  time  he  pleaded  guilty,  the  government  had  disclosed \nin  the  ballpark of  1,300  pages  of  discovery.  The  difference  between \nthe  FBI  and  AUSA's  records  is  enormous.  The  FBI  is willing  to \ndisclose  more  records  than  AUSA.  Common  sense  begs  the  question: \nWhat  is  AUSA  hiding?! \nRemarkably,  the  government  has  a  record  of  misconduct  in \nthis  case  as  noted  by  Judge  Gleeson  when  he  vacated  the  guilty \nplea.

I  conclude  that  he  was  not  sufficiently  informed  about \nthe  facts.) \nFirst,  certainly,  one  of  the  evidences  in  FBI's  records  is/ \nincludes  the  designation  of  TTP  as  a  FTO  in  September  of  2010  -\nan  exculpatory  evidence  - as  noted  in  Exhibit  1.  Second,  most \nsignificantly,  the  government  has  never  disclosed  any  discovery \non  their  first  7  month  (June  2010  - February  2011)  of  a  total  14 \nmonth  FBI  investigation.  Arguendo,  the  government  maintains  that \nthis  case  arose  from  incidental  wiretap,  and  yet,  on  the  other \nhand,  they  don't  disclose  any  discovery  from  the  beginning  of  the \ninvestigation  so  Hasbajrami  can  litigate his  counter  argument \nas  he  was  the  main  \"Target\". \nUnequivocally,  this  is  prosecuterial  misconduct.  Abs.olutely, \nnon-disclosure of  these  records  constitutes  a  prosecutorial \nmisconduct.  Ferrara v.  U.S.,  456  F.3d  281-86  (1st  Cir.  2006)  : \n(members  of  prosecution  knowingly  withheld  and  then  manipulated \nevidence  that  the  defendant  had  not  ordered  a  murder  he  plead \nguilty  to  committing.) \nWithout  a  doubt,  had  Hasbajrami  been  aware  of  these  enormous \nrecords  he  would  have  NOT  pleaded  guilty.

I'm  reluctant ... the  case \ncould  be  resolved by  plea.  (pg  2,  3,  4) \n(hearing  transcript  3/2/15).\" \nSince  AUSA  Mr.  Ducharme  was  reluctant  that  the  case would \nbe  resolved  by  plea  and  in  order  to  avoid being  excoriated  and \nembarrased  by  Judge  Gleeson  again,  AUSA  Mr.  Ducharme  asked  the \ncounsel  to  ACT  as  if the  defendant  was  asking  the  government \nto  extend  a  higher-plea  than  15  years.  On  May  27,  2015,  counsel, \nMr.  Bachrach,  as  he  covertly  has  agreed  wit~  AUSA  Ducharme \nbegged  the  government,  in  front  of  the  court,  to  offer  20  year \nplea  agreement  (hearing  transcript  5/27/15). \nAs  mentioned  above,  it was  the  intention  of  the  Judge,:Counsel, \nand  AUSA's  into  forcing  me  to  enter  a  plea,  and  nowhere  does \nit appear  that  Hasbaj rami  was  interested  in  a  plea.  A ploy  w_as \nbeing  concocted  by  3  parties.  Since  his  attorney  were  so  keen \nin  pursuing  the  court's  interest .. ~a.nd  not  his,  their consultations \nalways  revolved  around  entering  a  plea  agreement. \nRemarkably,  Mr.  Bachrach,  stated  in  one  of  the  attorney \nclient meetings  that,  \"There  is  no  defense  i.n  your  case\",  and \nneither  did  he  discuss  any  possible  defense  strategies.

Two  Lead  attorneys  told  him;  Ex-Lead  attorney \nZissou:  \"I can  win  this  case.  There  is  nothing  here.\"  and  current \nly  Lead  attorney  Dratel:  \"If you  go  to  trial,  75%  you  will  win \nthis  case.\"  Yet,  Mr.  Bachrach  can't  find  even  one(1)  defense. \nConversely,  the  one  who  doesn't  have  a  defense  is  the  government \nbecause  with  all  these  \"Problems\"  there  is  no  case. \nThe  most  b~sic  requirement  of  effective  assistance  under \nthe  Sixth  Amendment  is  correct,  timely  advice  about  elements \nthe  prosecution  must  prove  to  obtain  a  conviction,  how  the  pro \nsecution  will  try  to  match  the  facts  to  the  elements  and  what \nconsequences  are  likely  to  follow  at  trial  and  at  sentencing. \nAdvice  of  that  nature  is  the  whole  point  of  having  legally, \ntrained  and  professionally  licensed  counsel.

A \nbrilliant  advice  for  an  effective  counsel  without  even  looking \nat  the  evidences.  Thus,  rendering  himself  ineffective.

Yet  his  attorney \nwould,  \"Recommend  it (plea)  to  him ... \"  and  \"Encourage  the \ngovernment  to  make  it available\"  (hearing  transcript  3/2/15 \npg  3,  4),  when  there  is  no  case  to  begin  with. \nIn  sum,  these  are  the  undeniable  facts: \n1)  Individual  #1  was  not  in  fact  a  terrorist  (PSR) \n2)  There  is  no  conspiracy  (Exhibit  4) \n3)  They  had  proof ... evidentiary ... legal  problems \nsentencing  transcript  1/8/13  pg  23) \nDespite  all  these  facts  his  attorney(s)  made  him  plead  guilty \nand  didn't  proceed  to  trial.

When  judges  participate  in \nplea  discussions,  a  defendant  may  ''view  the  judge  as  an  adversary \nduring  the  bargaining  process,  rather  than  as  the  embodiment \nof  his  guarantee  of  a  fair  trial and  sentence.\"  Kathleen \nGallagher,  Judicial  Participation  In  Plea  Bargaining:  A search \nfor  New  Standards,  9  Harv.  C.R.-C.L.L.  Rev.  29,  44  (1974); \nsee  also  White,  supra  note  3,  at  452-53  (\"The  judge  may  jeopar \ndize  his  role  as  an  impartial  arbiter of  justice  if he  partici \npates  in  plea  negotiating.\")  The  loss  of  judicial  integrity  is \nparticularly  serious  when,  the  judge  explicitly or  implicitly \nadvocates  a  particular bargain.  see  Werker,  535  F. 2d  at  203  ·-~ \n(\"As  a  result  of  his  participation,  the  judge  is  no  longer  a \njudicial  officer  or  neutral  arbiter.  Rather,  he  becomes  or  seems \nto  become  an  advocate  for  the  resolution  he  has  suggested  to \nthe  defendant.\")  However,  legitimate  concerns  exist  even  when \nthe  judge  does  not  urge  a  particular course  of  action  upon  the \ndefendant :1  the  unequal  positions  of  the  judge  and  the  accused ... \n\" \nraise  a  question  of  fundamental  fairness\"  regardless  of  the \ndegree  or  type  of  judicial  involvement.

Judicial  involvement  detracts \nfrom  a  judge's  objectivity  in  three  ways. \nI.  \"[S]uch  involvement  makes  it difficult  for  a  judge \nto  objectively  assess  the  voluntariness  of  the  plea\" \neventually  entered  by  the  defendant.  Notes  of  Advisory \nCommittee  on  Rules  at  351;  see  also  Adams,  634  F.2d \n839  (\"We  cannot  truly  expect  this  role  to  be  filled \nby  a  trial  judge  who  has  participated  in  discussions \nleading  to  a  plea  bargain  for  such  a  judge  may ... feel \na  personal  stake  in  the  acceptance  of  the  plea  or  have \na  preconceived  notion  of  its validity.\");  Note,  Guilty \nPlea  Bargaining:  Compromises  By  Prosecutors  to  Secure \nGuilty  Pleas,  112  U.

Judicial  participation  in  plea  discussions  that  ult \nimately  fail  inherently  risks  the  loss  of  a  judge's \nimpartiality during  trial,  not  only  because  he  becomes \naware  of  the  defendant's  possible  interest  in  pleading \nguilty,  but  also  because  he  may  view  unfavorably  the \ndefendant's  rejection  of  the  proposed  agreement.  see \nAdams,.  634  F. 2d  at  840  ( \"The  judge  who  suggests  or \nencourages  a  particular plea  bargain  may  feel  a  personal \nstake  in  the  agreement  and  may  therefore  resent  the \ndefendant  who  rejects  his  advice ... ).

(\"The \ndefendant  is  likely  to  make  incriminating  concessions \nduring  the  course  of  plea  negotiations.\")  Werker,  535 \nF.2d  at  202.  Here,  Hasbajrami  was  made  to  plea  to \nconspiracy  charge  371  and  Providing  Material  Support \n18 \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 215     Filed 10/23/24     Page 32 of 48 PageID #:\n2868\nthat he  is  not  guilty  of.  Also,  the  allocution  incrim \ninated him  in  supporting  a  \"Group\"  while  in  fact  he \nwas  only  dealing  with  the  one  person,  Individual  #1. \n(\"Nor  can  we  fail  to  consider  the  subtle.pressures \nthat  may  be  exercised by  a  jµdge  against  a  defendant \nwho  rejects  an  opportunity ... [to]  relieve  the  judge \nof  a  lengthy  trial.\") \nIII.  Involvement  in  plea  negotiations  diminishes  the  judge's \nobjectivity  in  post-trial matters  such  as  sentencing \nand  motions  for  a  judgment  acquittal.  see  White,  at \n453;  see  also  Gallagher,  at  44.  (\"If  a  judge  urges \na  defendant  to  plead  guilty  in  exchange  for  a  sentencing \nconcession  and  the  defendant  rejects  the  arrangement, \nthe  judge  may  desire  to  reaffirm  his  initial belief \nin  the  defendant's  probable  guilt  after  the  defendant \nhas  been  convicted  at  trial.\") \nThird,  such  participation  is  prohibited because  a  judge's \nparticipation  is  plea  negotiations  is  \"inherently coercive.\" \nUnited  States  v.  Ushery,  785  F.3d  210,  219  (6th  Cir.  2015).  see \nHarris,  635  F.2d  at  529  (\"if  the  court  puts  its  imprimatur  on \na  plea  offer,  the  defendant  might  be  coerced  into  taking  it ... \") \nThis  is  exactly what  happened  here.  Hasbajrami  was  even  made \nto  sign  the  plea  in bullpen  not  in  front  of  court,  to  hide  the \ncoercion  and  to  look  good  in  front  of  the  court.  Cameras  will \nverify  it. \nAlso,  judicial  involvement  in  plea  negotiations  inevitably \ncarries  with  it the  high  and  unacceptable  risk of  coercing  a \ndefendant  to  accept  the  proposed  agreement  and  plead  guilty. \nsee  Werker,  535  F.2d  at  202  (\"Judicial  intervention  may  coerce \nthe  defendant  into  an  involuntary  plea  that  he  would  not  other \nwise  enter.\").  Among  other  things,  \"it might  lead  the  defendant \nto  believe  that  he  would  not  receive  a  fair  trial,  were  there \na  trial before  the  same  judge.\"  Notes  of  Advisory  Committee  on \nRules,  1974  Amendment,  18  U.S.C.A.

Johnston, \n316  U.S.  101,  104,  86  L.  Ed.  1302,  62  S.  Ct.  964  (1942),  but \nalso  necessarily  risks  the  incarceration  of  even  innocent  criminal \ndefendants.  See  Noted  of  Advisory  Committee  on  Rule  at  351 \n(\"The  risk of  not  going  along  with  the  disposition  apparently \ndesired  by  the  judge  might  induce  the  defendant  to  plead  guilty, \neven  if  innocent.\")  (emphasis  added)  The  same  is  true  here.  That \nunacceptably  high  risk of  coercion  exists  even  if  the;judge  does \nnot  explicitly endorse  a  particular plea  agreement:  \"regardless \nof  the  judgeJs  objectivity  it is  the  defendant's  perception  of \nthe  judge  that  will  determine  whether  the  defendant  will  feel \ncoerced  to  enter  a  plea.\" Werker,  535  F.2d  at  202. \nThe  defendant  may  fear  that  rejection  of  the  plea  will  mean \nimposition  of  a  more  severe  sentence  after  trial  or  decrease \nhis  chances  of  obtaining  a  fair  trial before  a  judge  whom  he \nhas  challenged.  These  fears  are  admirable  expressed  by  ~udge \nWeinfeld: \n\"The  unequal  positions  of  the  judge  and  the  accused, \none  with  the  power  to  commit  to  prison  and  the  other \ndeeply  concerned  to  avoid  prison,  at  once  raise  a \nquestion  of  fundamental  fairness.  When  a  judge  becomes \na  participant  in  plea  bargaining  he  brings  to  bear \nthe  full  force  and  majesty  of  his  office.  His  awesome \npower  to  impose  a  substantially  longer  or  even  maximum \nsentence  in  excess  of  that  proposed  is  present  whether \nreferred  to  or  not.  A defendant  needs  no  reminder  that \nif he  rejects  the  proposal,  stands  upon  his  right  to \ntrial and  is  convicted,  he  forces  a  significantly  longer \nsentence.  One  facing  a  prison  term,  whether  of  longer \nor  shorted  duration,  is  easily  influenced  to  accept \n20 \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 215     Filed 10/23/24     Page 34 of 48 PageID #:\n2870\nwhat  appears  the  more  preferable  choice.

When  a  plea  bargain  is  presented  by  the  court,  neither \nthe  defendant  nor  the  government  has  an  incentive  to \nargue  that  the  plea  is  involuntarily,  unknowing  or \nunjustified by  the  facts:  both  have  already  agreed \nto  the  bargain  and  are  in  court  to  seek  its  acceptance. \nIt  is  up  to  the  judge,  therefore,  to  take  an  active \nrole  insuring  that  Rule  11's  core  concerns  are  adequate \nly  dealt  with.  We  cannot  truly  expect  this  role  to  be \nfilled  by  a  trial  judge  who  has  participated  in  dis \ncussions  leading  to  a  plea  bargain,  for  such  a  judge \nmay  (as  discussed  below)  feel  a  personal  stake  in  the \nacceptance  of  the  plea  or  have  a  preconceived  notion \nof  it's validity.  Moreover,  the  judge  may,  in  the  course \nof  plea  discussions,  commit  himself  or  herself  to  a \nparticular bargain  before  he  or  she  has  all of  the \nrelevant  information;  many  important  facts  (including \ndisclosed  in  the  pre-sentence  investigation)  are not \nknown  before  the  plea  agreement  is  officially  presented \nto  the  court.\"  United  States  v.  Werker  supra  at  204. \nBy  intervening  to  facilitate  a  plea,  a  judge  communicates \nto  the  defendant  that he  desires  a  plea.  He  thereby  raises  the \npossibility,  if only  in  the  defendant's  mind,  that  a  refusal \nto  accept  the  judge's  preferred  disposition  would  be  punished. \nIt  is  not  only  a  trial court's  sentencing  power  which  gives \ncoercive  potential  to  it's participation  in  the  plea bargaining \nprocess,  but  also  the  court's  control  over  the  conduct  of  a \ntrial.  \"The  defendant  must  view  the  judge  as  the  individual who \nconducts  the  trial and  whose  rulings  will  effect what  the  jury \nis  to  consider  in  determining  guilt  or  innocence.  The  defendant \nmay  therefore  be  reluctant  to  reject a  proposition  offered \n21 \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 215     Filed 10/23/24     Page 35 of 48 PageID #:\n2871\nby  one  who  wields  such  immediate  power.\"  Werker,  535  F.2d  at \n202. \nThe  prohibition  exists  because  of  \"concern  that  a  defendant \nmight  be  induced  to  plead  guilty  rather  t?an  risk displeasing \nthe  judge  who  would  preside  at  trial.\" and  \"would  facilitate \nobjective  assessments  of  the  voluntariness  of  a  defendant's  plea.\" \n133  D.

Accordingly,  when  a  district court \nexpresses  its preference  for  or  against  certain plea-bargaining \nterms  in  an  unfinalized  or  hypothetical  plea  agreement,  the  court \nimpermissibly  participates  in  plea  negotiations  in  violation \nof  Rule  11.

God does not guide the congregation of wicked ones:· \nSince ,ve are a tribe, because of his anger my brother kicked me out of the house. and l was scared. \nstayed in some [sic] cities for approximately 7-8 months. \nThen I requested permission from the brother of a woman whom I had met on the internet, [for me) to \nmarry his sister [sic] on God's command.  He said, ''You need to come here to the city of Van so that \nwe may gel to k.now you better:· I then counseled with my mujahid siblings who lived in a city [sic], \nand took along a mujahid [older] brother of mine who substituted for my father and we went to the city \nof Van.  We requested the girl from her brother and her father, on God's command. The siblings and \nbrothers of the girl were content with her marrying me but the mother objected it due to the Al-Qaeda \nissue and some other problems in her mind.  We vvere also having some doctrinal issue with her \n[older] brother; he was not accepting the hadith and was taking the verses as they were, not even \nlooking at the interpretation[s]. So I said \"I am not about to change my religion for a girl'· and this \nmarriage issue was closed. Where is this [sic], this is in violation of the boundaries set by God.  You \nmay go and ask one thousand individuals to marry, but marry only one of them, or if one has the \nmeans, he may marry four individuals.  God has warranted this and made it halal, but nowadays our \nsociety, ·whose members pose as iVluslims, considers even the second marriage to be adultery. That's \nwhat's called violating the boundaries set by Goel, not ,,vhat I was doing.  Atier that, since the marriage \ndidn't happen, I went around many cities in the name of visiting Muslims.  In one of the cities I was \nvisiting, I met an intelligence [sic] by the name \"Omer ~azmi Kh'.!.i!h)\" who introduced himself as \nMuslim and was an English student at the Adap.az.ad Universit.)~. He knew how to utilize the internet \nvery well, [whereas] l was only able to look at forums.  He made me a member to a site called \nFacebook.  We [sic] met an individual named '·Afgan kanascisi\" on that site.  On the second day after \nmeeting [her on the site], I told her that I ,:vanted to marry [her] and she accepted.  I said \"let me come \nand request [to marry] you from your father\" and she said \"my father would not give a girl to \nMuslims, once a Muslim came and requested [to marry] me\" and she explained that her father scolded \n[the Muslim person] by saying '·even if your God came clown from the skies I would not give my \ndaughter to clerics.\"  I said \"alright, tell me what to do,\" and she asked ··would you kidnap me?\" So I \ntook a mujahicl sibling along, and we kidnapped her.  Our mujahicl brother performed our wedding. \nMay God be pleased with him. So it all happened within 15 days, from the time we met until the time \nwe got married.  Praise be [to Him] that my Lord granted me an auspicious spouse.  We are now \ncarrying out jihad in Afghanistan with my spouse and, God willing, she gave me a cute son, named \nMuhammed Bera. \nMy spouse is truly an auspicious spouse. I am pleased with her and may my Lord be pleased with her \ntoo.  With my mother's help, we made peace with those [back] at home. \\Ve moved into the home \nwith my spouse.  Later, in.~iLlQQ2:Jny brother and I. and one other person, 3 of us were arrested. \nNobody is linked to the other.

That friend [sic] and my other sibling got along well. though he \n[sic] used to provoke him [sic] against me all the time as well.  God brought us face-to-face in the F \nType prison.  That friend used to say \"Ebu Yasir, I didn't know who you were:·  After staying in \nprison for 9 month~, while I was still in prison [sic] there were 2 children that I had with the vvoman I \nhad di~ed first, one being a girl and the other a boy, the girl's name being Zeynep, 7 years old, [I \nheard that] they had registered her in a school affiliated with the system of the Evil.  I wrestled with \nmy family and my brother in order to get my daughter out of [that] school.  They beat me up because \nof that.  I couldn't accept that and my spouse and I migrated to another city.  Later, with God's \ndiscretion, we made contact with Selahaddin Azeri.  At the time I had produced a counterfeit passport \nfor Selahaddin Azeri so that he could get to Azerbaijan.  Arter 4 months immediately following my \ngelling out of prison, my spouse, my son and I ,-vent on 1i1e Alglk1-;-{,iihad [sic].  They did not give me \nmy daughter.  I came to Selahaddin's congregation where he had become the Emir.  I became the \nMedia Emir, to take care of the media work of their congregation, since I was knowledgeable in media \ntasks.

Supposedly his daughter's name being \nEsila, I named him Ebu Esila, so that his true identity would not be revealed.  I told Selahaddin about \nthis Ebu Esila, and about his abilities too.  Emir said \"if you trust him, there is no problem.\"  Since \n·- - -~ \nEsila said that he had links to Belgium, Netherlands, Germany and France, I made him the European \n---'--------- --\nRepresentative, but Emir never trusted him. \nHe also had the passwords to these help emails.  When an individual emailed us, both Esila and I were \nfollowing up with it.  Later on, so that there would be no problem, I thought it be best if Esila followed \nup [by himselfJ.  I ,:vas checking the emails every once in a while, but not a penny came through the \nones I was working on.  We [sic] met a \\voman named Ayse on the internet.  The name of my current \nspouse who is full of obedience and fear of God is also Ayse.  I wanted to obtain my wife's consent \nand have a second wife.  Also, I named her Hatice.  I asked around for help for her to come here, not \nin behalf of the congregation, but just for this woman to make it here [sic].  They sent small amounts \nof money, in the name of Durana Topcu.  All in all, the money sent was 900 dollars.  Some individuals \ngot in Hatice's mind aQd ' told her that the women here were treated ~like a slave.  Sh e gave up on \ncoming here.  She sent the 900 dollars back here for the families of mujahids.  I gave 60 dollars of that \nmoney to Selahaddin, I 50 dollars to Commander Ebu Nub for repairs in his home, 60 dollars to \nbrother Ebu Enes for his food expense and he [Ebu Enes] was given nearly 500 dollars to build a \nhouse because he didn't have a house.

As detailed below, for a number of\nreasons, the government’s arguments are all without merit.\nFor example, in relegating the issue of disclosure to security-cleared defense counsel to\nPoint II, the government puts the cart before the horse:  ultimately, the government claims the\nquerying was “reasonable,” but bases that conclusion on 32 separate redactions of classified\ninformation in a 36-page submission.  Yet that begs the questions:  How can the Court make that\ndetermination accurately and fairly without participation by defense counsel?  How does a party\nstand a chance at success in litigation if it is denied access to the facts that are essential for the\nCourt’s evaluation?\nIn addition, the government asserts that certain legal principles apply, yet they are each\nunavailing to sustain the backdoor querying the government conducted in its investigation and\n\n           LAW OFFICES OF Honorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nJune 24, 2022\nPage 2 of 15\nprosecution of Mr. Hasbajrami.  Indeed, the government ignores entirely any contrary law,\nincluding even express declarations within the Second Circuit’s opinion in this case.  That begs\nan additional question:  Imagine the Court’s impression of the state of the law with respect to the\npertinent issues herein if it read only the government’s opposition Memo of Law, and not Mr.\nHasbajrami’s Initial Memo of Law and this Reply?  The same is true of the facts, except that Mr.\nHasbajrami’s security-cleared counsel have thus far been denied the opportunity to comment\nthereon.\nAs discussed below,\n(1)  contrary to the government’s contention, the collection, retention, and subsequent\nsearching of private electronic communications, and the government’s indefinite\nunfettered access to it, are not a “minimal intrusion” on an individual’s privacy;\n(2)  in contending that a warrant is not necessary for querying, the government\nreverses the legal presumption – a warrant is the default requirement – while\nmischaracterizing the Second Circuit’s opinion and ignoring the concerns\nCongress and others have expressed with respect to warrantless querying of the\nSection 702 databases;\n(3)  in relying on the “foreign intelligence exception,” the government seeks to\nconflate and bootstrap authority for the initial interceptions to the querying.  That\nwould negate the entire intent and purpose of the Second Circuit’s remand, and\ncreate an impermissible legal “backdoor” for Section 702 (50 U.S.C. §1881)\ndatabase “backdoor searches”;\n(4)  the “special needs” exception in inapposite because the backdoor querying fails to\nmeet the standards for a viable “special needs” search;  and\n(5)   the government’s invocation of the “good faith” doctrine is unavailing because it\nfails to address the government’s persistent violations of the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Act (“FISA”), and Section 702 in particular, that have not only gone\nuncorrected for decades, but which, as set forth post, at 13-14, have continued\neven since Mr. Hasbajrami’s Initial Memo of Law was filed.\nIn addition, the government’s arguments against disclosure to security-cleared defense\ncounsel fails to address not only the unique circumstances of this case, but also the Second\nCircuit’s express direction that this Court should decide that issue de novo – which clearly\nportends that the litany of prior cases the government cites are not dispositive.\n\n           LAW OFFICES OF Honorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nJune 24, 2022\nPage 3 of 15\nNotably, the government does not claim that if Mr. Hasbajrami’s motion is successful,\nthat the government would have sufficient evidence to continue its prosecution of him.  Indeed,\nthe contrary is the case.  The present litigation resulted out of a conditional guilty plea and as\nsuch this motion presents a categorical issue that by the terms of the parties’ agreement will\ndispose of this case without a trial.  \nAccordingly, for the reasons set forth below, as well as those in Mr. Hasbajrami’s Initial\nMemo of Law, it is respectfully submitted that Mr. Hasbajrami’s motion should be granted in its\nentirety, the fruits of the warrantless backdoor querying suppressed, and the prosecution against\nMr. Hasbajrami dismissed in its entirety.\nIn addition, and at a minimum, unless the government’s mistakes are so clear to this\nCourt that no input is needed to find for Mr. Hasbajrami, then the classified information in the\ngovernment’s Memo of Law (and any other pertinent classified information) should be disclosed\nto security-cleared defense counsel so that defense counsel may aid this Court in discerning the\naccuracy and veracity of the government’s classified statements.  \nDisclosure is particularly appropriate in this case, in which the government’s statements\nand omissions have already been proven to be unreliable in the District Court and have frustrated\nthe Second Circuit’s efforts to ascertain the scope of the backdoor querying.  See, e.g., United\nStates v. Hasbajrami, 2014 WL 4954596, *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 2, 2014) (ECF #85) (Order\npermitting Mr. Hasbajrami to withdraw his guilty plea due to government’s deliberate failure to\nprovide Section 702 notice);  United States v. Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d 641, 648 (2d Cir. 2019). \nSee also Initial Memo of Law, at 8, 23 n. 10.\nI.  Disclosure Is Necessary and Appropriate In This Case to Assist the \nCourt in Making an Accurate Determination, and to Satisfy Due Process \nThe government’s claim that Mr. Hasbajrami “fail[s] to address the relevant question\nwhether the specific queries in this case were reasonable under the Fourth Amendment[,]” Gov’t\nOpp., at 1, borders on gaslighting considering the government’s refusal to provide any facts to\nsecurity-cleared defense counsel for review and analysis of that very question.\nAlso, in its entire nine pages of argument on the subject, see Gov’t Opp., at 27-35, the\ngovernment ignores completely the fact that the Second Circuit did not foreclose disclosure to\nsecurity-cleared defense counsel.  Rather, it left if for this Court to determine.  Hasbajrami, 945\nF.3d at 677 n. 24.  See also Initial Memo of Law, at 30.  The Second Circuit could quite easily\nhave decided that issue against Mr. Hasbajrami or omitted it from its opinion.  Its guidance is\ninstructive in that regard.\n\n           LAW OFFICES OF Honorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nJune 24, 2022\nPage 4 of 15\nIn addition, with respect to the government’s account of its misrepresentations to Mr.\nHasbajrami at the outset of the case regarding the very issue still being litigated – the electronic\nsurveillance pursuant to Section 702 – contrary to the government’s exoneration of itself, see\nGov’t Opp., at 33 (neither the District Court nor Second Circuit “found any evidence of\nprosecutorial misconduct related to the timing of the notice”), Judge Gleeson did, in fact, declare\n(and the Second Circuit repeated) that, “[w]hen the government provided FISA notice without\n[FISA Amemdents Act (“FAA”)] notice, Hasbajrami was misled about an important aspect of his\ncase.”  United States v. Hasbajrami, 2014 WL 4954596, *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 2, 2014) (ECF #85). \nSee also Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 648 (“the government’s misleading notice, according to the\ndistrict court, prevented Hasbajrami from knowing that he could challenge the evidence against\nhim on the grounds that Section 702 was unconstitutional”).\nThe government’s devotion to secrecy as a means of shielding itself from accountability\nfor Fourth Amendment violations, and its concurrent disdain for the adversary process, is\nrepeated in its opposition.  In a defiant and brazen – and remarkably transparent – attempt to\ndeny this Court the opportunity to decide the important issues in this case, including whether to\ndisclose materials and information to security-cleared defense counsel, the government\nrespectfully submits that that FISC [Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Court], rather than a district court adjudicating a case-\nspecific suppression motion, should assess the reasonableness of\nthe government’s Section 702 querying procedures and practices at\nthe general level.  The FISC has the necessary statutory mandate,\nexpertise, and record evidence before it to undertake that\nfunction.[]\nGov’t Opp., at 26 (footnote omitted).1\nIt is, of course, preposterous for the government to assert that this Court would not\npossess the competence to decide these issues.  The Second Circuit could have easily referred the\nmatter to the FISC if it thought that was the proper forum, and/or that this Court was not capable\nof determining the issues.  Indeed, it is most telling with respect to the merits of these issues that\nthe government requests that this Court abdicate the responsibilities entrusted to it by the Second\nCircuit, and instead send the matter to an ex parte Court in which, by design, opposing arguments\nare not presented, and (unsurprisingly) the government never loses.\nIn remanding the matter to this Court, as the government acknowledges, the Second\n1  Of course, the government has redacted that footnote.\n\n           LAW OFFICES OF Honorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nJune 24, 2022\nPage 5 of 15\nCircuit “directed this Court to consider ‘what databases were queried by whom, for what reasons,\nwhat (if any) information was uncovered by such queries, [and] what (if any) use was made of\nany information uncovered.’”  Gov’t Opp., at 6.\nYet, it is inconceivable that the answers to those questions, and deciding whether the\nqueries were “reasonable,” could be determined accurately or fairly, or consistent with Fifth\nAmendment Due Process and the Fourth Amendment as well, without security-cleared defense\ncounsel’s ability to review and analyze the facts related to those issues.  Consequently, without\ndisclosure, how could a court ever be assured that a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights are\nsufficiently protected while his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel is being\ndirectly undermined by the government’s Fifth Amendment Due Process deprivation?  \nNevertheless, notwithstanding both the government’s repeated misrepresentations and\nevasions in this case, discussed in Mr. Hasbajrami’s Initial Memo of Law, at 23-27, and the\nFISC’s annual recitation (in its opinions) of the persistent violations of the Fourth Amendment\nand statutory protocols relevant to Section 702 interception, the government’s position remains,\n“trust us” that the querying conformed with the Fourth Amendment.  At this stage, and in light of\nthe Second Circuit’s explicit directive that this Court can consider the disclosure issue de novo,\nthe government’s position is untenable.2\nThe government’s assertion that the Classified Information Procedures Act (“CIPA”)\nwould not be useful in navigating the disclosure issue also is without foundation, which is\nevident from the failure to provide citation to any authority for that claim.  See Gov’t Opp., at 33-\n34.  In fact, CIPA principles and procedures have been considered sufficiently flexible to be\napplied in situations for which they were not expressly devised.  \nFor example, in United States v. Moussaoui, 365 F.3d 292 (4th Cir.), opinion amended on\nreh’g, 382 F.3d 453 (4th Cir. 2004) the Fourth Circuit applied CIPA to a defendant’s Sixth\nAmendment right to compulsory process in order to obtain information from persons (secretly) in\nU.S. custody.  Id., at 308 n. 12.  See also Initial Memo of Law, at 96.\nEven more recently, earlier this year, in United States v. Husayn, ___ U.S. ___, 142 S. Ct.\n959 (2022), Justices Gorsuch and Sotomayor, in dissent, cited CIPA as a means of regulating\n2  The government relies repeatedly on United States v. Muhtorov, 20 F.4th 558 (10th Cir.\n2021) to forestall disclosure.  See Gov’t Opp., at 15-16 n. 9, 28-29, 32 & 35.  However, Mr.\nHasbajrami’s Initial Memo of Law, at 8, 12, 17 n. 7, 18, 24 n. 11, 27 n. 13, 45 n. 27, 92 n. 59, 98\nn. 60, thoroughly distinguishes Muhtorov – a fact the government’s opposition declines to\nacknowledge at all.\n\n           LAW OFFICES OF Honorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nJune 24, 2022\nPage 6 of 15\ndisclosure of classified information in a civil case.  Id., at *28 (Gorsuch, J., joined by Sotomayor,\nJ., dissenting).  See also id., at *19-20 (Kagan, J., dissenting).\nIn that context, contrary to the government’s protests, see Gov’t Opp., at 25-26, 31-32,\nexamination of the history of Section 702 violations is specifically relevant to whether disclosure\nto security-cleared counsel is necessary and appropriate in this case.  Ultimately, in light of the\nhistorical record of repeated, unpunished, and unremedied violations of Section 702 program\ngenerally (and FISA generally), and the backdoor querying process in particular (since its\ninception), how can the Court be confident of an accurate determination without the substantive\nparticipation of security-cleared defense counsel in evaluating the facts at issue?\nAs Justices Gorsuch and Sotomayor noted in their dissent in Husayn, “[t]here comes a\npoint where we should not be ignorant as judges of what we know to be true as citizens.”  Id., at\n20, citing Watts v. Indiana, 338 U.S. 49, 52 (1949).  This case presents just such an instance.3\nII.  As the Courts Have Held, and Contrary to the Government’s \nClaim, the Privacy Interests At Issue Herein Are Substantial \nThe government’s claim that Mr. Hasbajrami’s privacy interest in not having his\nelectronic communications subject to backdoor querying is “minimal” or “not significant,” see\nGov’t Opp., at 17-18, is not only manifestly wrong, but it also ignores completely the declaration\nby the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (“FISC”) in 2018 – cited in Mr. Hasbajrami’s\nInitial Memo of Law, at 41 – specifically with respect to querying that “[t]he Court regards the\nprivacy interests at stake as substantial.”  In re Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\n3  In analyzing the issues in Husayn, Justices Gorsuch and Sotomayor, examined the\nhistorical record in much the same manner as the Initial Memo did herein, contextualizing past\ninstances in which subsequent disclosures decades later revealed that the government, in\ninvoking the state secrets doctrine to preclude access to information, had not been candid to the\ncourts in claiming a need for secrecy.  In concluding that “[m]ore recent history reveals that\nexecutive officials can sometimes be tempted to misuse claims of national security to shroud\nmajor abuses and even ordinary negligence from public view[,]”  142 S. Ct. at *26, they cited\nseveral historical examples, including the initial state secrets case, Reynolds v. United States, 345\nU.S. 1 (1953), that was predicated on a lie.

In re DNI/AG 702(h)\nCertifications 2018, 941 F.3d 547 (FISA Ct. Rev. 2019) (“2018 FISC Op.).\nThat statement by the FISC was unremarkable because it simply restated longstanding\ndoctrine with respect to the privacy interests at stake in electronic communications.  For\nexample, in Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41, 63 (1967) (“[f]ew threats to liberty exist which are\ngreater than that posed by the use of eavesdropping devices”).  See also id., at 58 (“[t]he need for\nparticularity and evidence of reliability in the showing required when judicial authorization of a\nsearch is sought is especially great in the case of eavesdropping”).\nMoreover, while the government claims that “[c]hanges in technology make timing\nconcerns even more acute[,]” see Gov’t Opp., at 23, the concerns generated by changes in\ntechnology are exponentially greater with respect to privacy considerations – a fact the Supreme\nCourt has recognized in a series of cases decided in the past decade, and which the Second\nCircuit discussed in this case (again, ignored by the government).  945 F.3d at 671-72.  See, e.g.,\nCarpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018);  Riley v. California, 573 U.S. 373 (2014); \nUnited States v. Jones, 565 U.S. 400 (2012).  See also United States v. Moalin, 973 F.3d 977,\n991-92 (9th Cir. 2020) (the “long-term surveillance, made possible by new technology, upends\nconventional expectations of privacy”), citing Jones, 565 U.S. at 429.4\nIII.  The Backdoor Querying In This Case Required a Warrant\nMr. Hasbajrami’s Initial Memo of Law, at 31-36, explains why the Fourth Amendment\nrequired a warrant for the backdoor querying in this case.  The government does not address\nthose arguments.  Nor does it, once again, confront the substance of the Second Circuit’s\nextensive discussion, in its opinion in this case, of the cases and considerations that would make\na warrant necessary.  945 F.3d at 670-72.  See Gov’t Opp., at 16-17.\nThe Second Circuit’s explication of the warrant requirement was neither idle nor\nsuperfluous.  Nor is the government’s claim availing that the “court of appeals did not suggest\nthat any presumption of a warrant requirement applies in this context,” Gov’t Opp., at 17, since\nthe Second Circuit did not have to mention the presumption because that is settled law.  See Katz\nv. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 357 (1967) (searches undertaken without a warrant, as was the\ncase here, “are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment – subject only to a few\nspecifically established and well-delineated exceptions”).\n4  While the government claims, in its opposition, at 11, “Section 702 is not implemented\nby collecting communications in bulk[,]” at the very least Section 702 intercepts are stored in\nbulk, and essentially queried in bulk.  See Initial Memo of Law, at 8-23.\n\n           LAW OFFICES OF Honorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nJune 24, 2022\nPage 8 of 15\nThe government, at 24 of its opposition, grievously mischaracterizes the Second Circuit’s\nopinion herein by repeating the following quote as support for the government’s argument that\nquerying does not require a warrant:\nIf it is reasonable – and indeed necessary to the national security –\nfor intelligence agencies to monitor the communications of\nsuspected foreign terrorists abroad, the need to keep track of the\npotential threat from abroad does not lesson because some of the\nsuspect’s contacts turn out to be American nationals, or foreign\nnationals located within the United States.\nHasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 667.\nYet if that statement applied to querying rather than only to the initial interception\npursuant to Section 702, there would not be any need for remand.  Thus, the analysis is different,\nas is the conclusion.  Indeed, the government proposes a standard not in effect, claimin that the\nFourth Amendment principle of reasonableness “generally requires obtaining a warrant when law\nenforcement officers conduct a search for evidence of ordinary crime, [but] that procedure is by\nno means inflexibly required.”  Gov’t Opp., at 17, citing Maryland v. King, 569 U.S. 435, 447\n(2013).  In fact, the converse is true:  a warrant is required unless the search is covered by a\nrecognized exception.  See, e.g., Katz, 389 U.S. at 357.  See also Initial Memo of Law, at 31-36.5\nThe government also fails to address Riley, which involved a device seized lawfully, but\nfor which a subsequent search of the digital information stored within required a warrant before\nreview could occur.  573 U.S. at 401.  Likewise, the government’s facile treatment of Carpenter,\nsee Gov’t Opp., at 21-22, ignores the importance of stored digital information, and simply does\nnot acknowledge the Second Circuit’s application of Carpenter’s principles (without deciding) to\nquerying.  Jones, too, involved information that could be lawfully collected discretely, but which\nin aggregate required a warrant.  565 U.S. at 415-16 (Sotomayor, J., concurring).  See also Initial\nMemo of Law, at 33-37, 39, 42, 49-50, .6\n5  In addition, as discussed in Mr. Hasbajrami’s Initial Memo of Law, at 22, 33 n. 17,\nmany in Congress have concluded that a warrant should be required for querying Section 702\ndatabases.\n6  The cases cited by the government at 24-25 of its opposition for the proposition that\nquerying of lawfully obtained information does not require a warrant were all decided before\nCarpenter, Riley, and Jones, and even before Section 702 was enacted.\n\n           LAW OFFICES OF Honorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nJune 24, 2022\nPage 9 of 15\nThe government also asserts, “where the governmental need is especially compelling or\nlikely to be frustrated by a warrant requirement[,]” a warrant may not be required.  Gov’t Opp., at\n20.  However, here the government has not offered any rationale or evidence – either generally or\nspecifically related to this case – why the requirement that it obtain a warrant would “frustrate” a\ngovernmental need.\nSimilarly, the government notes, at 24-25, that the warrant requirement can be relaxed\n“where expectations of privacy are diminished[.]”  Yet, as pointed out ante, at 6-7, that is not the\ncase here.  Likewise, this is not a situation “where alternative safeguards restrain the government\nwithin reasonable limits.”  Id.  Instead, as the Initial Memo of Law, at 46-82, makes clear, the\ngovernment has acted with ultimate impunity without consequence in the context of Section 702\nquerying.  The evidence of continued violations, absent any accountability, dispositively refutes\nthe government’s contention.\nThe government also maintains, in its opposition at 23, that \n[e]ven when the government has enough information to obtain a\n“query warrant,” the need to develop such information, prepare an\napplication, and obtain judicial approval for every query would\nresult in delays that would hinder the government’s ability to\nmonitor and respond to fast-moving threats.  See In re Directives,\n551 F.3d at 1011-12; [Privacy & Civil Liberties Oversight Board]\nReport 104-06.\nYet that complaint is always the excuse for why a warrant would be inconvenient.  In\naddition, the urgency with respect to querying is diminished, as it does not involve real-time\nmonitoring, but instead retrospective database searching.  See Initial Memo of Law, at 19-23.7 \nThat argument is as futile here as it is generally with respect to the warrant requirement, which is\nnot a matter of inconvenience, but rather a fundamental constitutional imperative.\nIV.  The Second Circuit’s Opinion and Remand Make It Clear That the \nForeign Intelligence Exception Does Not Encompass Backdoor Querying\nThe government’s contention, in its opposition, at 20, that querying is within the foreign\nintelligence exception provides an illustrative example of the government’s selective resort to\n7  In re Directives, cited often by the government, is inapposite.  It involved an ex parte\napplication of the Protect America Act, the predecessor statute to Section 702, and did not\naddress querying, but rather the initial overseas interceptions.  551 F.3d at 1015.\n\n           LAW OFFICES OF Honorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nJune 24, 2022\nPage 10 of 15\nisolated portions of the Second Circuit’s opinion – depriving them of proper context – and\nignoring the opinion’s contrary meaning.\nThe government’s claim is merely an attempt at bootstrapping the authority for the initial\nSection 702 interception/collection to excuse the subsequent querying.  If that were the case, the\nSecond Circuit could have (and would have) easily combined its ruling on the first question with\nwhat it left open for this Court.  Also, in declaring that querying constitutes “a separate Fourth\nAmendment event,” 945 F.3d at 670, the Second Circuit clearly rejected the government’s claim\nthat the foreign intelligence exception encompasses the subsequent querying of Section 702\ndatabases.\nLikewise, the cases the government cites in its opposition at 21-22, all relate to initial\nSection 702 interception (or, like In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d 717 (FISCR 2002), predate Section\n702 altogether and therefore do not address the issues present in this case at all), and not\nsubsequent backdoor querying.  The Second Circuit case, Cassidy v. Chertoff, 471 F.3d 67 (2d\nCir. 2006), is not even related to Section 702 (and predates its enactment), much less subsequent\ndatabase querying.8\nV.  The Backdoor Querying Fails to Satisfy the Criteria for the “Special Needs” Exception\nMr. Hasbajrami’s Initial Memo of Law, at 38-40, sets forth in detail the prerequisites for\napplication of the “special needs” exception to the Fourth Amendment and its warrant\nrequirement.  In contending the “special needs” exception rescues the backdoor querying at issue\nin this case, the government (again) ignores that discussion entirely.  As set forth in Mr.\nHasbajrami’s Initial Memo of Law, the querying here fails to satisfy the criteria for the “special\nneeds” exception.\nVI.  The “Good Faith” Exception Does Not Apply In This Case\nAs a threshold matter, the government is mistaken in claiming, in its opposition, at 15,\nthat because this remand is for the purpose of examining whether the querying violated the\n8  In the case in which the Second Circuit first articulated the foreign intelligence\nexception, In re Terrorist Bombings, 552 F.3d 157 (2d Cir. 2008), the Court adopted the\nexception to the traditional warrant requirement because the eavesdropping of a U.S. citizen\noccurred overseas, and the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement did not apply outside the\nU.S.  Id., at 171.  Thus the electronic surveillance (which was also governed by a separate\nsurveillance authority, Executive Order 12,333, see Initial Memo of Law, at 128) was evaluated\nsolely pursuant to a reasonableness standard.  Id.\n\n           LAW OFFICES OF Honorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nJune 24, 2022\nPage 11 of 15\nFourth Amendment and not the provisions of the FISA statute, FISA’s categorical suppression\nmechanism that would preclude application of the “good faith” exception does not apply.\nFISA’s statutory remedy, set forth in 50 U.S.C. §1806(b), provides that if the Court\n“determines that the surveillance was not lawfully authorized or conducted, it shall . . . suppress\nthe evidence which was unlawfully obtained or derived” from such surveillance.  (Emphasis\nadded).   No less a FISA authority that David S. Kris (see Initial Memo, at 110-11), has written in\nhis treatise that “[t]his ground for suppression plainly includes constitutional challenges to FISA\nitself.”  David S. Kris & J. Douglas Wilson, 2 National Security Investigations & Prosecutions\n§32:3 (2d ed. 2012). \nThus, if the Court finds that the querying in this case was unlawful, §1806(g) mandates\nsuppression and the “good faith” exception is unavailable to the government.  See also United\nStates v. Giordano, 416 U.S. 505, 524 (1974) (suppression required by a statute “does not turn on\nthe judicially fashioned exclusionary rule aimed at deterring violations of Fourth Amendment\nrights”).  \nNor would the “good faith” exception rescue the querying in this case even if it were\napplicable.  As the Second Circuit has explained, “[i]t is the Government’s burden – not [the\ndefendant’s] – to demonstrate the objective reasonableness of the officers’ good faith reliance”\non binding appellate precedent.  United States v. Ganias, 755 F.3d 125, 140 (2d Cir. 2014), rev’d\non other grounds, 824 F.3d 199 (2d Cir. 2016) (en banc), citing United States v. Voustianiouk,\n685 F.3d 206, 215 (2d Cir. 2012).\nIn addition, the “good faith” exception is applicable only when government personnel\nconducts a search “in objectively reasonable reliance on binding judicial precedent.”  Davis v.\nUnited States, 564 U.S. 229, 247 (2011).  As the Eleventh Circuit initially explained, however,\nbinding judicial “precedent on a given point must be unequivocal.” United States v. Davis, 598\nF.3d 1259, 1266 (11th Cir. 2010) (emphasis added), aff’d, 564 U.S. 229 (2011).\nHere, the government cannot satisfy that burden.  Indeed, as recounted ante, at 4, the\ngovernment’s claims of “good faith” ignore Judge Gleeson’s blunt characterization of the\ngovernment’s misrepresentations in this very case that required Mr. Hasbajrami’s initial guilty\nplea to be vacated.  \nJudge Gleeson elaborated that there existed “a DOJ [Department of Justice] policy that\ntranscended this case” designed to intentionally fail to provide notice of warrantless FAA\nsurveillance.  Order, October 2, 2014 (ECF #85), at 6).  That defines bad faith, as the only\nplausible rationale for such concealment was to prevent courts from adjudicating challenges by\ndefendants to Section 702 surveillance because DOJ itself had serious doubts about Section\n\n           LAW OFFICES OF Honorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nJune 24, 2022\nPage 12 of 15\n702’s constitutionality.  \nFurther proof is that here the government stood silently while Mr. Hasbajrami entered a\nguilty plea that was neither knowing nor intelligent, and, rather than acknowledge Section 702’s\nrole in this case, watched him be sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment as a result.  Nor is the\ngovernment’s excuse for its prevarication, set forth in its opposition, at 33, viable, and it did not\nconvince Judge Gleeson, either.\nThe government’s resort to the “good faith” doctrine only reinforces the need for\ndisclosure to security-cleared defense counsel.  “Good faith” is essentially a factual question,\neven if the standard is objective.  It would be perverse if the only party able to review, analyze,\nand argue the facts is the very party whose “good faith” is at issue.  That is not just an ex parte\nproceeding, but something even more fundamentally antithetical to justice.\nAlso, repeated violations of the type catalogued in Mr. Hasbajrami’s Initial Memo of\nLaw, at 46-82, augmented by additional disclosures made since the Initial Memo of Law was\nfiled, set forth post, at 13-14, vitiate any claim of “good faith.”  See Herring v. United States,\n555 U.S. 135 (2009) (United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984), would not apply to “deliberate,\nreckless, or grossly negligent conduct, or in some circumstances recurring or systemic\nnegligence”).\nIn that context, revelations since Mr. Hasbajrami’s Initial Memo of Law was filed\nDecember 24, 2021,  continue to disclose and document the FBI’s extraordinary abuse of\nelectronic surveillance and investigative authority.  They also amplify the need for disclosure\nhere to security-cleared defense counsel, as it remains apparent that an insular approach only\nencourages, even enables, impunity with respect to the violations of civil liberties that attend\nsuch secrecy.9\nFor example, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence’s (“ODNI”) calendar year\n2021 Office of Civil Liberties, Privacy, and Transparency, Annual Statistical Transparency\n9  In a January 27,. 2022, Letter to Congress, Avril Haines, the Director of National\nIntelligence, warned that “[d]eficiencies in the current classification system . . . reduce[] the\nIntelligence Community’s (IC) capacity to effectively support senior policymaker\ndecision-making, and further erodes the basic trust that our citizens have in their government.” \nJanuary 5, 2022, Letter from Avril D. Haines, DNI, to Senator Ron Wyden and Senator Jerry\nMoran, available at bit.ly/3xYdzGq.  See also Dustin Volz, “Vast Troves of Classified Info\nUndermine National Security, Spy Chief Says,” The Wall Street Journal, January 27, 2022,\navailable at on.wsj.com/3NiZ3P0.\n\n           LAW OFFICES OF Honorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nJune 24, 2022\nPage 13 of 15\nReport Regarding the Intelligence Community’s Use of National Security Surveillance\nAuthorities, Calendar Year 2021, (April 29, 2022) (“ODNI 2021 Transparency Report”),\navailable at bit.ly/3OEUVdb, notes, at 19, “[f]or the first time, the Annual Statistical\nTransparency Report now includes the number of queries using U.S. person identifiers run by\nFBI against unminimized Section 702 collection.”  It also points out that “the frequency with\nwhich FBI uses U.S. person query terms is greater than other agencies.”  Id., at 20.10\nThe ODNI 2021 Transparency Report documents an astounding increase in the number\nof estimated FBI queries of U.S. person “unminimized Section 702-aquired contents and\nnoncontents for foreign intelligence information and/or evidence of a crime” in 2021:  from\nfewer than 1,324,057 from December 2019 through November 2020 to 3,394,053 from\nDecember 2020 through November 2021.  Id., at 21.\nPerhaps even more disturbing, the ODNI 2021 Transparency Report identified “four\ninstances in which . . . a FISC order was required pursuant to section 702(f)(2) but not obtained\nprior to reviewing the results of a query that was not designed to find and extract foreign\nintelligence information and was performed in connection with a predicated criminal\ninvestigation that does not relate to national security.”  Id., at 22 (emphasis added).\nNor did the FBI even seek or obtain any such orders.  Id.  Thus, FBI had a zero percent\ncompliance record last year.  Nor is there any evidence of any discipline or other remedial efforts\nby either FBI or the FISC (which has not issued its customary annual opinion for 2021).  Yet the\ngovernment argues here that (1)  the “good faith” exception applies; and (2)  the Court should\nshield itself from evidence of systemic, unrelenting violations by FBI in conducting U.S. person\nquerying of Section 702 databases.11\n10  See Initial Memo of Law, at 13-15, 52 n. 33 & 112 n. 71, for discussion of prior ODNI\nTransparency Reports.\n11  Separately, in January this year, Senators Charles Grassley (R – Ia.) and Richard\nDurbin (D – Ill.) drew attention to a 2019 FBI internal audit (not released publicly until January\n2022) that “found widespread violations of internal policies designed to ensure proper handling\nof the FBI’s most sensitive investigations.”   March 28, 2022, Letter from Richard J. Durbin and\nCharles E. Grassley to Christopher A. Wray, Director, FBI (footnote omitted), available at\nbit.ly/3bjxqrD.  According to Sens. Grassley and Durbin, the findings demonstrated “apparently\nsystemic violations of approval and notification requirements” within FBI.  The audit examined\n353 of the FBI’s most sensitive investigations between between January 1, 2018, and June 30,\n2019 – “just under half of all such matters that were pending during this 18-month period” – and\n“identified 747 violations,” more than two per investigation.  Id.  See Federal Bureau of\n\n           LAW OFFICES OF Honorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nJune 24, 2022\nPage 14 of 15\nGiven the persistent and pervasive volume of violations, and the repeated admonitions by\nthe FISC, see Initial Memo of Law, at 46-82, reasonable government officials “should have\nknown that the statute was unconstitutional.”  Illinois v. Krull, 480 U.S. 340, 355 (1987).12\nAlso, in its opposition, at 12, the government asserts that “appropriately trained and\nauthorized personnel of the agencies that have access to unminimized information acquired under\nSection 702 [] are permitted to review such information and evaluate and determine whether it\nreasonable appears to be foreign intelligence information or evidence of a crime.” (Citation\nomitted).\nThe government cannot both insist that its personnel are “appropriately trained and\nauthorized” and maintain that the same personnel who continue to commit unpunished violations\nflagged by the FISC and other authorities are acting in “good faith.”  In that context, the \n“government’s querying practices as a whole” are certainly relevant to evaluating whether the\ngovernment can rely on the “good faith” exception, since those patterns and practices shed light\non any exercise of “good faith.”  See Gov’t Opp., at 25-26.  See also Gov’t Opp., at 31-32.13\nMoreover, the querying practices as a whole, and an unbroken historical record of non-\nInvestigation, Compliance and Mitigation Unit Report, 2019 Domestic Investigations and\nOperations Guide, Audit, Inspection Division, External Audit and Compliance Section, January\n10, 2020, available at bit.ly/3QO3sME.\n12  At least one FISC opinion has already concluded that the government violated the\nstatutory requirements of the FAA during the very same period of time as the surveillance which\nintercepted Hasbajrami's communications.  See [Redacted], 2011 WL 10945618, at *9 (FISC\nOct. 3, 2011) (finding that the Government’s minimization procedures contradicted the FAA’s\nrequirements).  See also Initial Memo of Law, at 17-18.\n13  In its opposition, at 32, the government cites the opinion in United States v. Rosen, 477\nF. Supp.2d 538, 552 (E.D.Va. 2006) for the proposition that “in the context of minimization,\nstating that errors in other cases ‘are no more probative’ of the presence of errors ‘in this case\nthan a general study of errors committed over a period of years in baseball would be probative of\nwhether errors occurred in a specific game.’  Id., at 552.  Yet that is not an accurate statement.  If,\nover a period of time representing a sufficient sample size, an error was committed in every\nbaseball game, that would provide a basis for high statistical confidence that there would be an\nerror committed in the next game if the fundamental circumstances and variables remained\nmaterially the same.  The entire industry of baseball analytics (which now prevails in the game\nitself and dictates most strategy) is built predominantly on such probabilities.\n\n           LAW OFFICES OF Honorable LaShann DeArcy Hall\nDRATEL & LEWIS United States District Judge\nEastern District of New York\nJune 24, 2022\nPage 15 of 15\ncompliance within the Section 702 program and FISA generally are directly relevant to any claim\nof “good faith.”  Indeed, that would be the only way to judge “recurring or systemic negligence.” \nSee Herring, 555 U.S. at 144.  Evaluated under the appropriate standards, it is clear that the\n“good faith” exception does not apply to the backdoor querying in this case.\nConclusion\nAccordingly, for the reasons set forth below, as well as those in Mr. Hasbajrami’s Initial\nMemo of Law, it is respectfully submitted that Mr. Hasbajrami’s motion should be granted in its\nentirety, the fruits of the warrantless backdoor querying suppressed, and the prosecution against\nMr. Hasbajrami dismissed in its entirety.\nIn addition, and at a minimum, unless the government’s mistakes are so clear to this\nCourt that no input is needed to find for the defense, then the classified information in the\ngovernment's Memo of Law (and any other pertinent classified information) should be disclosed\nto security-cleared defense counsel so that defense counsel may aid this Court in discerning the\naccuracy and veracity of the government’s classified statements.\nRespectfully Submitted,\n  \nJoshua L.

This Memo of Law is submitted in advance of the government’s provision\nof information to the Court in order to preview the issues to be determined, and to emphasize the\nimportance of disclosure and discovery to security-cleared defense counsel.\nThe basis for this submission, essentially a continuation of Mr. Hasbajrami’s pretrial\nmotions, is the Second Circuit’s remand to the District Court for the purpose of determining, in the\ncontext of the electronic interception, retention, and searching of Mr. Hasbajrami’s communications\npursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”), “(a)  what (if any) evidence relevant\nto Hasbajrami was obtained by the government by querying databases, (b)  whether any such\nquerying violated the Fourth Amendment and, if so, (c)  whether any such violation tainted other\nlawfully-collected evidence.”  United States v. Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d 641, 646-47 (2d Cir. 2019).\nIt is respectfully submitted that (b) and (c) cannot be answered without an answer to (a),\nwhich renders discovery necessary in order for the Court to make an informed, constitutionally\ngrounded decision that includes an essential contribution from security-cleared defense counsel. \nAs discussed below, while (a) may well involve classified information, defense counsel\npossess the appropriate security clearance, and FISA itself provides two separate mechanisms, that\nwould authorize and even require discovery to cleared defense counsel in this unique case – the first\nsuch remand in FISA’s 43-year history.  In its opinion, the Second Circuit explicitly conferred upon\nthis Court the discretion to order such discovery.  Indeed, it is respectfully submitted that the specific\nsections of FISA, and the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process guarantee incorporated therein, require\n1\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 15 of 143 PageID #:\n2169\nit, and it can be accomplished seamlessly pursuant to the provisions of the Classified Information\nProcedures Act (“CIPA”).\nAs detailed below, the revival of this case after Mr. Hasbajrami’s initial plea of guilty was\nthe result of the government’s deliberate failure to disclose the specific nature of its FISA\nsurveillance.  Nor, once that misrepresentation was revealed, has the government been more\nforthcoming.  As the Second Circuit’s opinion notes repeatedly, as discussed below, the government\nwould not even disclose to the Court certain information, or provide declarative answers to questions\nposed at oral argument.  It is in that context of repeated non-disclosure that the remand occurred and\ndiscovery and disclosure here are necessary.\nThe government’s failure of candor demonstrated here is simply an example and extension\nof the government’s persistent history of non-compliance with FISA’s procedural and substantive\nrules and limitations – which implicate the Fourth Amendment’s search and seizure protections as\nwell as the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process guarantee – that have been catalogued repeatedly by a\nnumber of authorities:  from periodic declassified opinions issued by the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Court (“FISC”), to reports by the Department of Justice’s Inspector General (“DoJ IG”),\nthe National Security Agency’s Inspector General (“NSA IG”), and Office of the Director of National\nIntelligence (“ODNI”), to Congressional complaints and investigations, to reports from the Privacy\nand Civil Liberties Oversight Board (“PCLOB”).\nNor has oversight from those monitoring entities been sufficient to stem the tide of\nunremitting violations of both the rules governing the FISA process and the fundamental Fourth\nAmendment protections that apply even to collection of foreign intelligence of U.S. persons’\ncommunications.  \n2\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 16 of 143 PageID #:\n2170\nIndeed,  as  discussed  below,  recent  events  indicate  even  that  ineffective and  limited\nsupervisory mandate has been reduced.  As a result, only the traditional federal courts – and in this\ncase, this Court – are capable of enforcing those rules and preserving Fourth Amendment principles,\nbut only with the meaningful participation of cleared defense counsel.\nThe pervasive violations chronicled in those opinions and reports issued during the past two\ndecades – many of which are illuminating in the context of the Second Circuit’s opinion in this case,\nand many of which have been issued since the Circuit’s remand – depict a FISA system that has\nnever functioned properly, particularly with respect to adherence to Fourth Amendment or even\nstatutory standards, and especially with respect to the particular FISA program at issue in this case: \nso-called “Section 702” interception and querying authority.  \nAs set forth below, those opinions and reports also provide examples of violations during the\nvery period at issue in this case – 2011 – and reflect specific problems that exert a dispositive impact\non the issues the Second Circuit directed be resolved:\n(1)  the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (“FBI”) (and other law enforcement and\nintelligence agencies’) continued and widespread overly permissive and improper\naccess to Section 702 databases to pursue criminal investigations, including improper\nand indiscriminate use of “backdoor searches” and authority therefor that the FISC\ndeclared unreasonable in 2018 (and criticized for years before and since), inadequate\ninternal controls within FBI and National Security Agency (“NSA”) to control such\nbackdoor searches, and an abject absence of required recordkeeping;\n(2)  the general unreliability of applications for FISA interceptions, perpetuated through\nrenewal applications and subsequent querying, given the recent record and reporting,\n3\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 17 of 143 PageID #:\n2171\nbuttressed by the historical record of non-compliance throughout FISA’s history,\nincluding specific errors. violations, and abuses identified in the opinions and reports\nthat likely replicate similar errors in the applications made with respect to Mr.\nHasbajrami, i.e., the failure to include complete or contradictory information and/or\nexculpatory information (either in initial applications or renewal requests, or as part\nof the querying process);  and\n(4)   the government’s misrepresentations and evasions in this case, coupled with the\nFBI’s generally for years as documented in FISC opinions and elsewhere – to its own\nlawyers, by its lawyers to other lawyers in FBI and Department of Justice (“DoJ”),\nand to the FISC – and concealment that makes the Section 702 querying process (and\nFISA generally) completely untrustworthy to the extent that ex parte representations\ncannot be credited without scrutiny by an adverse party, e.g., security-cleared defense\ncounsel, and which demonstrate the weaknesses and susceptibility to error inherent\nin an ex parte process. \nIn addition, a recent decision issued since the Second Circuit’s opinion herein establishes that\nMr. Hasbajrami is entitled to notice of precisely what surveillance was conducted in the course of\nthe investigation, and its relation to the evidence ultimately to be used against him.  Thus far, the\ngovernment has, through a series of prevarications, evasions, and equivocations, repeatedly denied\nMr. Hasbajrami that notice to which he is entitled by statute, rule, and the Constitution.\nIt is inescapable – and the government has even acknowledged – that the disposition of Mr.\nHasbajrami’s motion to suppress will resolve this case categorically, as granting the motion will\ndeprive the government of sufficient evidence to prosecute Mr. Hasbajrami, and require dismissal\n4\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 18 of 143 PageID #:\n2172\nof the case, and concurrent vacatur of his guilty plea.\nThis submission is lengthy, but the record of non-compliance and abuse specifically in this\ncase and with respect to Section 702, and regarding FISA generally, is extensive and multifaceted\n– and even this catalogue is not exhaustive.  Given the complexity and unique character of these\nissues – which have a decade of history in this case, and which generated an 89-page opinion from\nthe Second Circuit – we respectfully request the Court’s permission and  indulgence to file this\noversized brief, as only a comprehensive submission can provide the requisite showing for the Court. \nAccordingly, it is respectfully submitted that the Court should order disclosure and discovery\nof the relevant materials to security-cleared defense counsel, and, ultimately, grant Mr. Hasbajrami’s\nmotion to suppress.\nStatement of the Facts\nGiven the detail provided in the Second Circuit’s opinion, see United States v. Hasbajrami,\n945 F.3d at 645-49, and the Court’s familiarity therewith (as demonstrated during the September 13,\n2021, pretrial conference), this Statement of Facts will limit repetition of that discussion to\ncontextual necessity, and instead address primarily matters not covered in the Second Circuit’s\ndiscussion.\nA.  Procedural History\nAgron Hasbajrami was arrested September 6, 2011, and ultimately charged with three counts\nof provision and attempted provision of material support to terrorists, and one count of attempt to\nprovide material support to terrorists, all in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§2339A(a), 2.  See Superseding\nIndictment, dated, January 26, 2012 (ECF # 20).\nAs described in Mr. Hasbajrami’s Revised Pre-Sentence Report, dated, February 6, 2013\n5\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 19 of 143 PageID #:\n2173\n(“PSR”):\nAn investigation by agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s\nJoint Terrorism Task Force (“JTTF”) revealed that between April 2,\n2011, and August 28, 2011, the defendant engaged in numerous email\ntransactions with individual #1, utilizing different email accounts. \nIndividual #1 (whose identity is known to the parties), is an individual\nthe defendant believed was associated with a terrorism organization. \nDuring the course of their emails, the two arranged for the transfer of\nmoney from the defendant to individual #1, purportedly to support\nIslamic fundamentalist terrorism operations, and to arrange for the\ndefendant’s  travel  to  the  Federally  Administered  Tribal  Areas\n(“FATA’s”) of Pakistan to join a jihadist fighting group.  More\nspecifically, the emails discussed and contained instructions and\ndetailed descriptions of the smuggling route that the defendant was to\ntake into the FATA, as well as contact instructions as to how the\ndefendant would make contact with individual #1 once he arrived in\nthe FATA, and how money should be sent to individual #1 from the\nUnited States, via a courier in Germany . . .\nPSR, at ¶¶ 2-3 (footnote omitted).  See also Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 645-47.\nHowever, “[n]otwithstanding the emails discussed . . . above . . . there [was]\ninformation to suggest that Individual #1 was not in fact a terrorist, and that he solicited funds from\nthe defendant for purposes unrelated to terrorism.”  PSR, at ¶ 3.\nNevertheless, Mr. Hasbajrami “was arrested by JTTF agents at John F. Kennedy International\nAirport in Jamaica, New York, on September 6, 2011, prior to boarding a flight bound for Istanbul,\nTurkey.”  Id.  A contemporaneous “search of the defendant’s luggage subsequent to his arrest\nrevealed a tent, boots and cold-weather gear.”  Id.  Also, “[t]he case agent advised that in a postarrest\nstatement, the defendant admitted to the entirety of the offense.”  Id.  See also Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d\nat 645, 647.\nMr. Hasbajrami pleaded guilty April 12, 2012, and was sentenced January 8, 2013, to 15\nyears’ imprisonment (see Judgment, January 16, 2013 [ECF # 45]).  However, as the Second Circuit\n6\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 20 of 143 PageID #:\n2174\nrecounted, the government, in a February 24, 2014, letter to defense counsel, “stated that ‘based on\na recent determination,’ it had concluded that the information obtained from FISA surveillance that\nthe government had already disclosed ‘was itself also derived from other collection pursuant to Title\nVII of FISA [i.e., Section 702] as to which you were aggrieved.’” Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 648\n(citation omitted).\nElaborating, the Circuit noted that “[t]he government’s provision of notice in this case was\nlikely in response the Solicitor General’s assertion, at oral argument before the Supreme Court in\nClapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398 (2013), that prosecutors would provide notice to\ndefendants in cases where evidence was derived from Section 702 surveillance.”  Hasbajrami, 945\nF.3d 648 n.3, citing Charlie Savage, “Door May Open Challenge to Secret Wiretaps,” The New York\nTimes, October 17, 2013, at A3.  See also id.

The Structure and Parameters of Section 702 Surveillance\nAs the Second Circuit’s opinion explains, Section 702 was enacted as part of the 2008 FISA\nAmendments Act (“FAA”), building on the initial FISA constellation of surveillance authorities\nincluded in the original 1978 legislation, 50 U.S.C. §1801, et seq., and expanded through several\npost-9/11 amendments.  Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 650.1\n1  As the Court pointed out, FISA was a reform designed to create limitations on the\ngovernment’s national security surveillance powers: “FISA was first enacted in response to\nrevelations about the government's electronic surveillance of the domestic communications of\nUnited States citizens.  See David S. Kris & J. Douglas Wilson, National Security Investigations\nand Prosecutions §3:7 [];  Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 650.  See also American Civil Liberties\nUnion v.

Ultimately, the Church committee issued a report\nconcluding that the federal government had, over many decades, ‘intentionally disregarded’ legal\nlimitations on its surveillance activities and ‘infringed the constitutional rights of American\ncitizens.’  Id., at 137”).\n8\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 22 of 143 PageID #:\n2176\nThus, the Court continued, “‘[t]raditional FISA’ surveillance, as surveillance under the FISA\nhas come to be known following the enactment of the FAA in 2008, governed surveillance inside\nthe United States, in the context only of national security investigations rather than domestic criminal\nprosecutions.”  Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 650, citing David S.

The 2017 ODNI\nTransparency Report disclosed that in 2017, intelligence agencies not including FBI, see 2020\nTransparency Report, at 17 n.*, “used 7,512 identifiers, like email addresses, that belonged to\nAmericans to search through the contents of 702 information, though it’s unclear how many\ncommunications were searched and how many times searches for Americans’ communications\ncontents were conducted.”  Greene.\n4  The 2020 total of 202,723 was, of course, affected substantially by the Covid-19\npandemic that generally reduced surveillance across all programs.

As a commentator\nhas pointed out, the numbers in the ODNI Transparency Reports are “simply incompatible with\nthe FISA Court’s description of dozens of such queries from the past year, and seems to\ndrastically misrepresent how common the phenomenon of Section 702-acquired information\nflowing into law enforcement queries can be.”  Jake Laperruque, “Key Takeaways From Latest\nFISA Court Opinion on Section 702 and FBIWarrantless Queries,” Just Security, April 28, 2021\n(“Laperruque:  Key Takeaways”), at 4, available at https://bit.ly/3Fp845R.

(“[t]he Hasbajrami court considered the querying of previously collected\nSection 702 analysis separately, which is something other courts have not done”).7\nAmong the important distinctions between Section 702 collection, retention, and querying\nof intercepted communications and conventional electronic surveillance pursuant to Title III, or even\n“traditional FISA,” are the minimization requirements.  In 2011 FISC Op., 2011 WL 10945618, at\n*5, Judge Bates noted that the FAA “requires that the minimization procedures ‘meet the definition\nof minimization procedures under [50 U.S.C. §§]1801(h) or 1821(4) . . .’”  Id., citing 50 U.S.C.\n§1881a(e)(1).  \nElaborating, Judge Bates pointed out that \n[m]ost notably, that definition requires “specific procedures, which\nshall  be  adopted  by  the  Attorney  General,  that  are  reasonably\ndesigned in light of the purpose and technique of the particular\n[surveillance or physical search], to minimize the acquisition and\nretention, and prohibit the dissemination, of nonpublicly available\ninformation  concerning  unconsenting  United  States  persons\n7  In Muhtorov, the Tenth Circuit expressly declined to address querying, making clear –\nwhile citing this case – that “[q]uerying might raise difficult Fourth Amendment questions that\nwe need not address here.”  Muhtorov, 2021 WL 5817486, at *25, citing Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at\n672-73 (footnote omitted).

Rather, “those communications  often remain in the agency’s databases\nunreviewed until they are retrieved in response to a database query, or . . . deleted upon expiration\nof their retention period, without ever having been reviewed.” Id., citing PCLOB Report, at 129.\nIn addition to the distinctions in the concept of “probable cause” – particularly the fact that\nindividual targets of surveillance are not necessarily reviewed by the FISC prior to acquisition of\ntheir communications – between traditional FISA warrants and Section 702 (50 U.S.C. §1881a)\nsurveillance and acquisition, the FISC’s oversight role with respect to the latter is “narrowly\ncircumscribed.”  In re Proceedings Required by §702(I) of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, No.\nMisc. 08-01, slip op. at 3 (FISA Ct. Aug. 27, 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted), available at\nhttps://bit.ly/3dXPo14.\nThe FISC is asked to opine on the lawfulness of an entire year’s worth of mass surveillance\nprospectively without reviewing a single targeting decision and without knowing how any one of\nthose searches affected U.S. persons.  In turn, during the subsequent year, the application of Section\n18\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 32 of 143 PageID #:\n2186\n702 procedures to actual persons and facts is not performed by judges, but instead by low-level\nintelligence analysts.  See PCLOB Report, at 42.\nInstead, the FISC’s role is essentially limited to reviewing the targeting and minimization\nprocedures that the government proposes to use to target and acquire communications prospectively. \nSee CRS Report: Overview, at 11 (footnote omitted).  The FISC must also find that the minimization\nprocedures are reasonably designed to minimize the retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of\ninformation that is about a U.S. person or that could identify a U.S. person.  Id.

Id.\nC.  “Backdoor” Searches of the Section 702 Database(s)\nThe minimization procedures also improperly permit the government’s retention of these\nU.S. person communications for later searching – the so-called “backdoor searches” – through which\nthe government subsequently queries its repository of FAA-collected communications specifically\nfor information about U.S. citizens and residents – like Mr. Hasbajrami – including for evidence of\ncriminal activity.  See PCLOB Report, at 59;  2011 Minimization Procedures §3(b)(6).9\n8  FISA defines a “United States person” to include “citizens, aliens lawfully admitted for\npermanent residence, and United States corporations.”  Muhtorov, 2021 WL 5817486, at *6 n.4,\nciting 50 U.S.C. §1801(i).\n9  Warrantless backdoor searches were once prohibited by the government’s minimization\nprocedures, but the prohibition was lifted in the October 3, 2011, 2011 FISC Op.  See Ellen\nNakashima, “Obama Administration Had Restrictions on NSA Reversed in 2011,” The\nWashington Post,  Sept. 7, 2013, available at http://wapo.st/1hP9FWm (the FISC “in 2008\nimposed a wholesale ban on such searches at the government’s request, said Alex Joel, civil\nliberties protection officer at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). The\ngovernment included this restriction ‘to remain consistent with NSA policies and procedures that\nNSA applied to other authorized collection activities,’ he said.  But in 2011, to more rapidly and\neffectively identify relevant foreign intelligence communications, ‘we did ask the court’ to lift\n19\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 33 of 143 PageID #:\n2187\nAs the Second Circuit explained in its opinion in this case, “[d]ata is frequently reviewed\nthrough queries, which identify communications that have particular characteristics specified in the\nquery, such as containing a particular name or having been sent to or from a particular e-mail\naddress.”  Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 657, citing PCLOB Report, at 127.  As the Court noted,\n“[c]olloquially, the parties (and those engaged in policy debates about the program) have referred\nto this querying capability as ‘backdoor searches.’”  Id., citing PCLOB Report, at 87.\nThe FBI’s querying of immense Section 702 database(s) is pervasive and routine, and extends\nbeyond  national  security  investigations.    As  the  2018  FISC  Op.  explained,  the  “2016  FBI\nMinimization Procedures require FBI personnel, to the extent reasonably feasible, to design queries\nof Section 702 data to find and extract foreign-intelligence information or evidence of crime.”  2018\nFISC Op., 402 F. Supp.3d at 80, citing 2016 FBI Minimization Procedures, §III.D, at 11. \nAccording to those same minimization procedures, it is “a routine and encouraged practice\nfor the FBI to query” 702 information in furtherance of authorized intelligence and law-enforcement\nactivities, including when “making an initial decision to open an assessment.”  2018 FISC Op., 402\nF. Supp.3d, citing 2016 FBI Minimization Procedures, §III.D, at 11 n.3.  See also 2018 FISC Op.,\n402 F. Supp.3d at 78 (FBI policy promotes “maximal querying of Section 702 information”).\nThe 2018 FISC Op. quoted a Supplemental FBI Declaration that asserted that “‘[d]atabase\nthe ban, ODNI general counsel Robert S. Litt said in an interview.  ‘We wanted to be able to do\nit,’ he said, referring to the searching of Americans’ communications without a warrant”).\nIn the present case, Mr. Hasbajrami’s communications were purportedly intercepted\nduring the period of April 2, 2011, through August 28, 2011, see Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 658. \nThe government has yet to reveal whether the backdoor searches that were conducted in this case\noccurred during the time that such were categorically prohibited by the government's\nminimization procedures.  If such was the case, it would present an additional ground for\nsuppression.\n20\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 34 of 143 PageID #:\n2188\nqueries are a critical tool,’ and in one system during fiscal year 2017, FBI ran approximately 3.1\nmillion queries ‘against raw FISA-acquired information . . ., including section 702-acquired\ninformation.’”  2018 FISC Op., at 74-75.  A “significant percentage” of those queries likely involved\nU.S. persons.  Id., at 75.  \nIndeed,  “[i]n  2017,  NCTC  [National  Counterterrorism  Center],  the  CIA,  and  NSA\ncollectively  used  approximately  7500  terms  associated  with  U.S.  persons  to  query  content\ninformation acquired under Section 702.”  Muhtorov, 2021 WL 5817486, at *87 n.29 (Lucero, J.,\ndissenting), citing 2018 FISC Op., at 75.  As a result, through Section 702, the government obtains\nthe “full contents” of a wide range of electronic communications, and can sift through a vast\nstorehouse for those by specific U.S. persons.  2018 FISC Op., 402 F. Supp.3d at 88.\nIn fact, during a 2015 FISC hearing (later declassified) before Judge Hogan, a government\nlawyer (whose name is redacted from the transcript) informed the Court that “[b]ecause these\nsystems are queried on such a routine basis, these federated systems in some ways are FBI’s Google\nof its lawfully acquired information.”  In re [Redacted], (FISC) (TFH), Transcript of Proceedings\nHeld Before the Honorable Thomas F. Hogan, October 20, 2015, at 34 (emphasis added), available\nat https://bit.ly/33tCztf.  Indeed, the lawyer confirmed, “[t]hey are quite routine.”  Id.\nThe 2018 FISC Op. also discussed “‘categorical batch queries’ (as opposed to queries\nconducted on the basis of individualized assessments).”  2018 FISC Op., 402 F. Supp.3d at 53. \nThose “batch queries” were quite problematic, as the FISC noted that “many, though not all, recent\nmisapplications of the querying standard by the FBI involved categorical batch queries.”  Id., at 83. \nAlso, the “batch queries” process evaded supervisory control, and threatened to do so in the future: \n“More significantly, the Court is doubtful that in practice FBI personnel will consistently channel\n21\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 35 of 143 PageID #:\n2189\ncategorical batch queries into §IV.A.3’s approval process before they examine content information\nretrieved by those queries.”  Id. \nMonitoring of the querying process during the relevant time period was also materially\nimpaired, if not rendered ineffectual altogether, by FBI’s refusal to require adequate and transparent\nrecords of queries of U.S. persons.  Not only were the reasons for backdoor searches of U.S. persons’\ncommunications not recorded, but agents were not compelled to distinguish (in writing) backdoor\nsearches of U.S. persons from those conducted on foreigners’ communications.  2018 FISC Op., 402\nF. Supp.3d at 52-53, 67-68, 73-91.  See also id., at 68-73 (describing limitations of FBI systems). \nIndeed, even after Congress in 2018 required the FBI to record the number of its U.S.-person queries\nin 2018, the agency failed to do so.  Id.\nIn that environment, the queries of U.S. persons’ communications circumvented Fourth\nAmendment protections by converting sweeping warrantless surveillance directed nominally at\nforeigners into a turbo-charged vehicle for investigating U.S. persons for ordinary criminal conduct. \nIn fact, the President’s Review Group recommended prohibiting the practice of backdoor searches,\nconcluding that the practice violates the “full protection of [Americans’] privacy,” see  PRESIDENT’S\nREVIEW GROUP ON INTELLIGENCE AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES, LIBERTY AND SECURITY\nIN A CHANGING WORLD 149, 145-50 (Dec. 12, 2013), available at https://bit.ly/3yWugSI (“PRG\nReport”).  Also, in June 2014, the House of Representatives voted to prohibit such searches.

The Ambiguous State of the Factual Record Regarding Backdoor Searches Herein\nHere, as the Second Circuit pointed out more than once, “At oral argument, the government\nwas unable to represent whether or not identifiers related to Hasbajrami had been used in querying\npreviously-acquired Section 702 surveillance databases.”  Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 660.  As a result,\nthe Court “ordered the government to ‘identify[ ] the record evidence that supports the proposed\nfactual inference that it conducted no queries or backdoor searches of Section 702 material with\nregard to Hasbajrami before or leading to the FISA court’bs issuance of Title I and Title III warrants\nwith respect to Hasbajrami.’ Order, United States v. Hasbajrami, Nos. 15-2684, 17-2669 (2d Cir.\nSept. 4, 2018), ECF No. 203.”  Id.  See also id., at 646 (“no information about any queries conducted\nas to Hasbajrami was provided to the district court, and the information provided to us on this subject\nis too sparse to reach a conclusion as to the reasonableness of any such queries conducted as to\nHasbajrami”).\nIndeed, the government’s position has been fluid and elusive.  At oral argument, the\ngovernment, rather than directly answer the question about queries in this case, instead – and in a\ndeparture from its prior briefing – claimed for the first time that this is “not a criminal case” that\n“arose from” a backdoor search.  Oral Argument at 45:20, United States v. Hasbajrami, Docket Nos.\n15-2684, 17-2669 (2d Cir. Aug. 27, 2018), available at https://bit.ly/3ywLeGK.10\nBut that is not the same as saying there was no backdoor search of Mr. Hasbajrami, and it\nmay well obscure a number of factual scenarios – namely, when government agents used a backdoor\n10  During oral argument, at 50:50 the government was extremely cagey in its responses,\navoiding answering directly the Court’s questions regarding backdoor searches, and instead\nrepeating either that (a)  the “criminal case” was not the product of a backdoor search; and/or (b) \nthe record did not disclose whether there was a backdoor search.  The government conceded\nambiguity with respect to the record, which precipitated the Circuit’s post-argument Order.\n23\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 37 of 143 PageID #:\n2191\nsearch but, in the government’s narrow, unilateral view, its ultimate criminal case did not “arise”\nfrom that search.  The government did not even purport to address how its queries of Mr.\nHasbajrami’s emails may have informed its other investigative efforts.11\nIndeed, the Government’s filing leaves open many possible scenarios in which the\nGovernment’s evidence was derived from a backdoor search of Mr. Hasbajrami.  For instance, the\nbackdoor searches of Mr. Hasbajrami’s communications could have contributed to investigative\nefforts wholly apart from the Title I and III FISA orders, including the government’s Rule 41,\nFed.R.Crim.P., warrants, orders (or warrants) pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2703 (Stored Communications\nAct), grand jury subpoenas, and use of informants, all of which were avenues that spanned many\nmonths.12\nMoreover, the government may be conflating the legal question of whether its criminal case\n11  Muhtorov is easily distinguished in this regard, as the Court therein, in concluding that\nthe defendant was not subject to any Section 702 database querying, limited its analysis to\n“whether the collection of his communications violated the Fourth Amendment.”  Muhtorov,\n2021 WL 5817486, at *12 (footnote omitted).  See also id., at *13 (“[t]here is nothing in the\nrecord to support that evidence derived from queries was used to support the traditional FISA\napplications”) (footnote omitted);  id., at *14 (“Mr. Muhtorov's as-applied challenge thus begins\nand ends with whether the incidental collection of his Section 702 communications was\nconstitutional”).\n12  The dissent in Muhtorov structured the “derivative evidence” question(s) as follows:\n[W]as the decision to seek traditional FISA authority influenced by\nany querying of §702 databases by the FBI using identifiers\nassociated with [the defendant]?  Or by information collected in\nother intelligence surveillance programs?  And if it was the result\nof querying of §702 databases, was the specific querying conducted\nreasonable under the Fourth Amendment under the facts of this\ncase? \nMuhtorov, 2021 WL 5817486, at *86 (Lucero, J., dissenting).\n24\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 38 of 143 PageID #:\n2192\nwas “derived from” a backdoor search with the factual question of whether one occurred at all.  The\nCircuit rejected the government’s conclusory claim, requiring through its remand a far more detailed\nexamination of how the FBI’s investigation proceeded.  Considering the government’s previous\nextended concealment of the Section 702 interceptions altogether, see ante, at 8, the remand is\nabundantly prudent.\nThe government also made a new set of assertions at oral argument about whether its\nexploitation of Mr. Hasbajrami’s emails occurred in “real-time.”  Oral Argument at 58:52.  Those\nclaims, too, are rife with ambiguity.  While the government asserted, at 59:00, “[t]his case involved\nvery, very focused attention by the U.S. government in real time or close to real time on the\ncommunications of foreign persons who were involved in international terrorism[,]” (emphasis\nadded),  with  respect  to  its  review  of  Mr.  Hasbajrami’s  communications,  the  government\nequivocated:  “perhaps it’s not fair to ask you to draw the inference that it was real-time or close to\nreal-time.”  \nIf not in real-time, that review would more than likely be through a subsequent backdoor\nsearch.  Indeed, the District Court’s opinion made clear that the government obtained\nwarrantless access to “many” of Mr. Hasbajrami’s emails pursuant to Section 702 prior to any\nshowing of probable cause, Dist. Ct. Op. at 24 (ECF #165), and those appear to include “historical\nemails” sent over “the months leading up to the initiation of the government’s investigation,” \nGovernment’s Brief on Appeal (2d Cir. ECF # 130) (“Gov’t Br.”), at 5.\nThe government also pointed to its Brief, but that provided little concrete information about\nhow and when FBI agents first encountered Mr. Hasbajrami’s emails in their Section 702 databases,\nhow long those emails had already been retained, or how long the FBI continued reviewing Mr.\n25\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 39 of 143 PageID #:\n2193\nHasbajrami’s emails without a warrant before seeking individual FISA orders.  See Gov’t Br., at 5-7. \nThe government has presented inconsistent timetables, but each nevertheless compels the\nconclusion that Mr. Hasbajrami was the subject of backdoor searches.  For example, the initial\nIndictment (ECF # 1), alleges a time frame of “between June 1, 2010 and September 6, 2011[.]”  Id.,\nat 1.  In its September 2011 motion to remand Mr. Hasbajrami the government alleged money\ntransfers by Mr. Hasbajrami “[b]eginning in 2010,” at 3, and/or Western Union transfers from\nDecember 2010 through February 2011.  See Government’s September 9, 2011, Memorandum of\nLaw in Support of the Government’s Motion for a Permanent Order of Detention, at 3, 4-5 (ECF #\n3).\nSince the government also reported that the surveillance was between April and September\nof 2011, see ante, at 6, 19 n.9, the earlier commencement strongly suggests a backdoor search that\nproduced information from essentially a year earlier than April 2011.  Indeed, there still remains the\nquestion whether the government gleaned information about Mr. Hasbajrami exclusively from\nquerying and not merely from identifying Mr. Hasbajrami through incidental interceptions of other\ntargets.  Regardless, at no point has the government claimed that the evidence it obtained against Mr.\nHasbajrami could have been discovered through an independent source wholly independent of the\npoisonous tree.  See post, at 43-45.\nNor did even the Circuit’s post-argument September 4, 2018, Order noted above yield a\ndefinitive  answer  from  the  government  about  backdoor  searches  of  Mr.  Hasbajrami’s\ncommunications.  In fact, the Circuit’s dissatisfaction with the nature and extent of the government’s\n(even ex parte) disclosures was a refrain throughout its opinion:\nBecause the district court was not even aware whether such querying\n26\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 40 of 143 PageID #:\n2194\nhad occurred, and because even we have not been advised as to what\nwas done, for what reasons, and with what results, we remand to the\ndistrict court to determine the facts, consistent with the considerations\nstated above, and to decide in the first instance, based on its factual\nfindings, whether there was a constitutional violation in this particular\ncase, and what (if any) evidence would need to be suppressed if there\nwas indeed a violation. \nHasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 673 (emphasis added).13\nE.  The Issues Identified by the Second Circuit for Resolution by This Court\nIn the factual context set forth above, the Second Circuit’s opinion identified a number of\nissues to be resolved upon remand.  As a threshold matter, the Court recognized multiple times that\nWhat kinds of querying, subject to what limitations, under what\nprocedures,  are  reasonable  within  the  meaning  of  the  Fourth\nAmendment, and when (if ever) such querying of one or more\ndatabases,  maintained  by  an  agency  of  the  United  States  for\ninformation about a United States person, might require a warrant,\nare difficult and sensitive questions. \nHasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 672-73 (emphasis added).  See also id., at 646 (“querying databases of\nstored information derived from Section 702-acquired surveillance also raises novel and difficult\nquestions”);  id., at 670 (“the storage and querying of information raises challenging constitutional\nquestions, to which there are few dear answers in the case law”), citing cf. In re Directives, 551 F.3d\nat 1015;  Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 670 (querying stored §702 data has “important Fourth Amendment\nimplications, and those implications counsel in favor of considering querying a separate Fourth\nAmendment event that, in itself, must be reasonable”). \n13  In contrast, again, Muhtorov is readily distinguishable, as the Court therein pointed out\nthat “[t]he government affirmatively represents that “‘the Section 702-derived evidence at issue\nwas not obtained or derived from queries using terms associated with Muhtorov.’  Aplee. Br. at\n45.”  Muhtorov, 2021 WL 5817486, at *13.  Thus, “‘[t]he record therefore shows that the Section\n702 information submitted to the FISC was not based on queries using terms associated with\nMuhtorov.’”  Redacted Aplee. Suppl. Br. at 10-11.”  Id.\n27\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 41 of 143 PageID #:\n2195\nThe Court did not “purport to answer them here, or even to canvass all of the considerations\nthat may prove relevant or the various types of querying that may raise distinct problems.” \nHasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 673.  Rather, the Court explained that “[q]uerying, depending on the\nparticulars of a given case (such as what databases are queried, for what purpose, and under what\ncircumstances),  could  violate  the  Fourth  Amendment,  and  thus  require  the  suppression  of\nevidence[,]” and concluded that as an initial determination “a district court must ensure that any such\nquerying was reasonable.”  Id., at 646.\nAs the Second Circuit emphasized, \nthere is still an open issue as to what queries of Section 702-acquired\ninformation occurred in this case, whether any such queries were\nreasonable and, if unreasonable, whether the queried information\ntainted the application before the FISC or in some other way would\nlead to the suppression of any evidence.\nHasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 673.\nThe Circuit also dispensed with several of the government’s arguments.  For example, \nin its post-argument briefing, the government argues that even if it did\nquery Section 702 databases, that action ultimately could not matter\nbecause the 80 communications collected as a result of incidental\ncollection would provide an independent source sufficient to support\nthe  FISC’s  probable  cause  determination.    Gov’t  Supplemental\nClassified Br. at 9 (arguing that “this Court’s analysis should be\nlimited to alleged ‘searches’ where a causal link can be drawn\nbetween  the  search  and  the  acquisition  of  the  evidence  that\nHasbajrami seeks to suppress.”).\nHasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 673-74.\nYet the Second Circuit rejected the government’s “independent source” rationale, declaring\nthat it could not “do so on the sparse record presented” because the Circuit did “not know what\ndatabases were queried by whom, for what reasons, what (if any) information was uncovered by such\n28\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 42 of 143 PageID #:\n2196\nqueries, or what (if any) use was made of any information uncovered.”  Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 672. \nSee also id., at 674 (“[w]e cannot apply the independent source doctrine on the record currently\nbefore us”).\nThus while “[t]he government has represented that no information derived from any such\nqueries was presented to the FISC to obtain the FISA warrant,” it had “not addressed whether any\nsuch information contributed to the investigation in other ways.  [Redacted]”  Id.  See also ante, at\n24 (providing examples of such uses).  Ultimately, the Circuit articulated, “[w]hat is unclear is just\nhow much Section 702-acquired information would remain, after further fact-finding at the district\ncourt.”  Id., at 675.\nConsequently, as the Second Circuit concluded, “[g]iven these considerations, the district\ncourt here must conduct an inquiry into whether any querying of databases of Section 702-acquired\ninformation using terms related to Hasbajrami was lawful under the Fourth Amendment.”  Id.  The\nSecond Circuit could not, “and should not, go further, pending development of a more complete\nrecord by the district court on remand, and an assessment by the district court as to whether whatever\nwas done was consistent with the Fourth Amendment and whether, if there was any illegality, any\nevidence should have been suppressed in response to Hasbajrami’s motion.”  Id., (footnote\nomitted).14\n14  Likewise, the Second Circuit left it “to the district court to determine, in the first\ninstance, whether any exceptions to the exclusionary rule, such as a good faith exception, might\napply in this case.”  Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 676 (footnote omitted).  Similarly, the Second\nCircuit delegated to this Court the initial determination whether, “if any evidence should have\nbeen suppressed, [] the failure to suppress that evidence was harmless, and if it was not what\nremedy is appropriate.”  Id., at 676-77.  Mr. Hasbajrami defers analysis of those issues pending\nthe government’s assertion that any particular Fourth Amendment exception (and/or harmless\nerror) applies, although it is noted that the good faith exception is not available for illegal FISA\nsurveillance.  See 50 U.S.C. §1806(g). \n29\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 43 of 143 PageID #:\n2197\nThe Second Circuit also endowed this Court with maximum flexibility in conducting its fact-\nfinding review and legal analysis:  “[o]n remand, the district court should undertake whatever\nproceedings are necessary, consistent with the considerations stated above.”  Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d\nat 677.\nF.  Disclosure to Security-Cleared Defense Counsel\nThat discretion expressly included disclosure of the underlying factual material (and certain\nlegal arguments) to security-cleared defense counsel:\nTo  the  extent  that  any  decisions  must  be  made  about  what\ninformation  is  to  be  presented  to  appropriately-cleared  defense\ncounsel, such decisions too are best left to the district court after it\nbecomes clear what the inquiry about querying will involve.  Cf.\n[United States v. Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d 102, 129 (2d Cir. 2010)]\n(noting that, under FISA, disclosure is exception and ex parte, in\ncamera review is the rule, and that the review of materials that are\n“relatively straightforward and not complex” may not necessarily\nrequire adversarial testing).\nHasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 677 (footnote omitted).\nAs a result, the Second Circuit denied “without prejudice to renewal before the district court\non remand” Mr. Hasbajrami’s motion for disclosure (to security-cleared counsel) of certain classified\nmaterials, including redacted portions of Judge Gleeson’s opinion, the government’s Rule 28(j) letter\nin the Circuit, and redacted portions of the Circuit’s opinion “consistent with the\nrequirements of CIPA and FISA.”  Hasbajraim, 945 F.3d at 677 n. 24.  Therefore, “the district court\nremains free to consider[]” the motion “in the first instance[.]”  Id.15\n15  The government’s Rule 28(j), Fed.R.App.P. letter, dated December 21, 2018, to which\nthe Circuit referred, was filed by the government ex parte, thereby raising the very distinct\nprospect that the government filed a supplementary authority, perhaps even a FISC opinion –\nindeed, the 2018 FISC Op. was issued October 18, 2018, in classified form but not declassified\nuntil well afterwards – without providing security-cleared defense counsel access to legal\n30\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 44 of 143 PageID #:\n2198\nARGUMENT\nPOINT I\nTHE COURT SHOULD ORDER THE GOVERNMENT \nTO DISCLOSE TO SECURITY-CLEARED DEFENSE\nCOUNSEL THE MATERIALS THE GOVERNMENT\nPROVIDES TO THE COURT IN CONNECTION WITH\nTHE PROCEEDINGS ON REMAND, AND ULTIMATELY\nGRANT MR. HASBAJRAMI’S MOTION TO SUPPRESS    \nIn remanding, the Second Circuit expressly concluded that Section 702 queries targeting\ninformation regarding U.S. persons constituted Fourth Amendment events independent of the initial\nincidental interception of the underlying communications.  See Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 670\n(government’s querying of a U.S. person’s communications intercepted pursuant to Section 702\nconstitutes a “separate Fourth Amendment event” that must independently satisfy constitutional\nrequirements).\nThat conclusion was imperative:  when government law enforcement or intelligence\npersonnel query the retained intercepted communications of a U.S. person pursuant to Section 702,\nthe authority for the initial interception is quite attenuated.  Indeed, at that juncture, not only has the\ntarget of the surveillance ostensibly changed, but the nature and degree of the intrusion on protected\ncommunications has also been transformed. \nAs the Supreme Court has recognized in a variety of contexts – including digital searches –\na search that relies on an exception to the warrant requirement is strictly limited by its original\njustification.  See, e.g., Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 19 (1968);  Riley v. California, 573 U.S. 373,\n400-401 (2014);  see also Hasbajrami, 945 F. 3d at 670-71 (reviewing cases).

See Riley, 573 U.S. at 404.\nThus, the Second Circuit assigned to this Court the task of determining whether the\ngovernment’s queries in its investigation of Mr. Hasbajrami violated the Fourth Amendment, and\ntherefore require suppression of all evidence derived from those queries.  As set forth below, that\nevaluation requires not only identification of relevant Fourth Amendment principles, but also\nanalysis of the scope and mechanisms of the querying system with respect to Section 702 databases.\nA.  Applicable Fourth Amendment Principles and Jurisprudence\nHere,  while  the  Second  Circuit  upheld  the  constitutionality  of  initial  warrantless\nsurveillance/collection  pursuant  to  Section  702  (i.e.,  the  “incidental”  interception  aspect  of\nsurveillance program itself), it did not decide whether later backdoor searches would still require a\nwarrant, or be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\n1.  The Warrant Requirement Applies to Section 702 Backdoor Queries\nThe first insuperable obstacle to the constitutional validity of any querying in this case is that\nsuch queries were conducted without a warrant.  As the Second Circuit intimated, and other cases\nhave held in analogous circumstances, querying in the Section 702 context requires a warrant.  As\na result, the warrantless querying in this case violated the Fourth Amendment.\nIn discussing Section 702 querying, the Circuit observed that “[t]he Supreme Court has\nexpressed increasing concern about the interaction between Fourth Amendment precedent and\nevolving government technological capabilities.  Riley rested in part on the fact that ‘[c]ell phones\n. . . place vast quantities of personal information literally in the hands of individuals.’  573 U.S. at\n386 [].”  Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 671.\n32\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 46 of 143 PageID #:\n2200\nTherefore,  because  of  the  scope  and  layers  of  information  accessible  in  the  digital\nenvironment, “[a] search of the information on a cell phone [therefore] bears little resemblance to\nthe type of physical search considered” in past cases.”  Id. [second brackets in original], also citing\nUnited States v. Ganias, 824 F.3d 199, 217-18 (2d Cir. 2016) (en banc) (noting privacy implications\nof expansive technology and data storage).16\nThe Second Circuit added that in Carpenter v. United States, ___ U.S. ___, 138 S. Ct. 2206\n(2018), in which the Supreme Court held that a warrant (rather than merely a Court order pursuant\nto 18 U.S.C. §2703(d) obtained under a standard less than probable cause) was required to gain\naccess to databases containing cell-site location information (“CSLI”), “the Court concluded that a\nwarrant (or a valid substitute) was required to acquire cell-site records, even though they were stored\nby a third party and under traditional Fourth Amendment doctrine a cellphone user would not have\nan expectation of privacy in such information[.]” Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 671.17\n16  As the dissent in Muhtorov reasoned, “If anything, the Fourth Amendment questions\nposed by §702 are even greater than those addressed in Riley because §702 communications may\nlegally be seized without any showing of probable cause, reasonable suspicion, or even any\nsuspicion of criminal activity.”  Muhtorov, 2021 WL 5817486, at *88 (Lucero, J., dissenting).\n17  As Machtinger points out, warrantless querying of Section 702 databases has been the\nsubject of controversy and criticism even inside government: \nBoth Executive Branch and congressional personnel have flagged\nthe lack of a warrant requirement for incidentally collected U.S.\nperson communication as a cause for concern. President Obama’s\nReview Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies\nrecommended that “it should take either a law enforcement or\nFISA judicial order to query the database. . . . [T]here should at\nleast be a judge involved before there is access to the contents of\nU.S. person communications.”[]  One draft bill in Congress would\nhave “[r]estrict[ed] law enforcement from using information\nobtained or derived from warrantless surveillance except when\ninvestigating the most serious crimes, like murder.”[]  The\n33\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 47 of 143 PageID #:\n2201\nIn Carpenter, the Supreme Court explained that it “decline[d] to grant the state unrestricted\naccess to a wireless carrier’s database of physical location information[] because, \n[i]n light of the deeply revealing nature of [this information], its\ndepth, breadth, and comprehensive reach, and the inescapable and\nautomatic nature of its collection, the fact that such information is\ngathered by a third party does not make it any less deserving of\nFourth Amendment protection. \nCarpenter, 138 S. Ct. at 2223.18\nAccordingly, “[t]he Government’s acquisition of the cell-site records here was a search under\nthat Amendment.”  Id.  See also Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 671-72 (quoting the entire passage).  Thus,\nthe Court in Carpenter rejected any exception for post hoc searches of databases in which the\nresident information was obtained absent any Fourth Amendment violation.\nCritically, in Carpenter the Court distinguished certain government conduct that mirrors the\nissues presented here.  For instance, the Court did not “consider other collection techniques\nHasbajrami case provides the opportunity for the judiciary to\naddress the issues as a matter of constitutionality.\nMachtinger, at 2.  Indeed, debate regarding the parameters of Section 702 querying, and the\nprerequisites for such searches, complicated and ultimately stalled Congressional action with\nrespect to renewal of certain FISA authorities.  See, e.g., Charlie Savage, “Surveillance and\nPrivacy Debate Reaches Pivotal Moment in Congress,” The New York Times, Jan. 10, 2018,\navailable at https://nyti.ms/3E5Axw6 (“[a] yearslong debate over National Security Agency\nsurveillance and protections for Americans’ privacy rights will reach a climactic moment on\nThursday as the House of Representatives takes up legislation to extend a program of warrantless\nspying on internet and phone networks that traces back to the Sept. 11 attacks”);  Faiza Patel,\n“The 702 Reform Debate Is Just Heating Up,” Just Security, May 16, 2016, available at\nhttps://bit.ly/3sbF4uw (a recent “hearing exposed key differences between those who believe that\nSection 702 should be narrowed . . . and those who believe that Section 702 should be\nreauthorized in essentially its current form”).\n18  Carpenter has been characterized as “one of this generation’s most important Fourth\nAmendment opinions.”  Alan Z. Rozenshtein, Fourth Amendment Reasonableness After\nCarpenter, 128 YALE L.J. FORUM 943, 943 (Apr. 1, 2019) (other citations omitted).\n34\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 48 of 143 PageID #:\n2202\ninvolving foreign affairs or national security,” but instead focused on the querying, extracting, and\nreviewing of CSLI held in third-party storage sites.  Carpenter, 138 S. Ct. at  2220 (emphasis\nadded).19\nThe Court in Carpenter concluded that access to “[t]he location information obtained from\nCarpenter’s wireless carriers was the product of a search.”  Id., at 2217.  As it recognized, just as\nwith Section 702 databases – which are searched for purposes of ordinary criminal investigations,\nsee post, at 51 – “[w]ith just the click of a button, the Government can access each carrier’s deep\nrepository of historical location information at practically no expense,” id., at 2217-18, thereby\ndiscovering “cell phone location information [that] is detailed, encyclopedic, and effortlessly\ncompiled.”  Id., at 2216.20  \nIn Carpenter, the Supreme Court recognized that reasoning applied to emails as well by\nciting United States v. Warshak, an opinion in which the Sixth Circuit noted:  “[b]y obtaining access\nto someone’s email, government agents gain the ability to peer deeply into his activities[.]” Id.,\n19  The mere fact that Section 702 initially targets the communications of non-U.S.\npersons has never before been sufficient reason to jettison the warrant requirement that protects\nU.S. persons’ electronic communications – neither in criminal investigations nor foreign\nintelligence investigations.  See Orin Kerr, “The Surprisingly Weak Reasoning of\nMohamud,” Lawfare, Dec. 23, 2016, available at https://bit.ly/2PfkPWx.  This Court should\nnot embrace such a novel exception here, which would license a sweeping end-run around\nU.S. persons’ Fourth Amendment rights.  As with other types of electronic searches, it is\nreasonable and practicable to require the Government to obtain an individualized court order\nwhen it seeks to retain and use communications that it knows are protected by the Fourth\nAmendment.\n20  In Carpenter, the Court reasoned that “[a]s technology has enhanced the Government's\ncapacity to encroach upon areas normally guarded from inquisitive eyes, this Court has sought to\n‘assure [ ] preservation of that degree of privacy against government that existed when the Fourth\nAmendment was adopted.’”  138 S. Ct. at 2214 (quoting Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27, 34\n(2001)).\n35\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 49 of 143 PageID #:\n2203\nUnited States v. Warshak, 631 F.3d 266, 284 (6th Cir. 2010).  See also Muhtorov, 2021 WL\n5817486, at *84 (Lucero, J., dissenting) (“I would not blind myself to the constitutional implications\nraised by a ‘vast body of information’ that may be ‘simply stored in a database, available for review\nby request from domestic law enforcement agencies solely on the speculative possibility that\nevidence of interest to agents investigating a particular individual might be found there’”), citing\nHasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 670.21\nThe Court in Carpenter was concerned – again quite pertinent here – that “the retrospective\nquality of the data here gives police access to a category of information otherwise unknowable . . .”\nand enabling the government to “travel back in time to retrace a person’s whereabouts, subject only\nto the retention polices of the wireless carriers . . .”  Id., at 2218.  As the Court declared, under such\ncircumstances, “the Government’s obligation is a familiar one – get a warrant.”  Id., at 2221.22\nAccordingly, querying a Section 702 database requires a warrant.23\n21  See also Carpenter, 138 S. Ct. at 2222, (quoting Warshak, 631 F.3d at 283-88 (“[i]f the\nthird-party doctrine does not apply to the ‘modern-day equivalents of an individual’s own\n‘papers’ or ‘effects,’ then the clear implication is that the documents should receive full Fourth\nAmendment protection”)).\n22  In Carpenter, the Court recognized that exigent circumstances, such as “the need to\npursue a fleeing suspect, protect individuals who are threatened with imminent harm, or prevent\nthe imminent destruction of evidence . . . [along with] bomb threats, active shootings, and child\nabductions,” may allow law enforcement to circumvent the warrant requirement for CSLI\nqueries.  Id., at 2223.  See also Riley, 573 U.S. at 73, citing Missouri v. McNeely, 569 U.S. 141,\n149 (2013) (providing two examples of exigent circumstances as “a suspect texting an\naccomplice who, it is feared, is preparing to detonate a bomb, or a child abductor who may have\ninformation about the child’s location on his cell phone).  However, in Carpenter, the FBI’s\ninvestigation of nine armed robberies and its urgency to identify all of the accomplices was not\nexigent.  Carpenter, 138 S. Ct. at 2212.  Here, notably, the government has not at any point\nsuggested its warrantless querying was motivated by any exigency.\n23  One commentator, in analyzing the Second Circuit’s opinion herein, suggests that\n“Carpenter provides a window into how the Supreme Court thinks about the constitutional\n36\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 50 of 143 PageID #:\n2204\n2.  The Querying Procedures As a Whole Should Be Examined \nto Determine if They Satisfy Fourth Amendment Standards\nThe querying procedure itself – as a precursor to examination of the specific querying in this\ncase – should also be evaluated for Fourth Amendment reasonableness as a threshold issue.  That\napproach conforms with how the FISC approves querying:  not on a fact-specific or case-by-case\nbasis, but based on the querying procedures themselves for the upcoming year.  Thus, even though\neach query is a separate Fourth Amendment event, the querying framework itself must pass\nconstitutional muster. \nAs the FISC has repeatedly acknowledged, the querying rules are an important element of\nthe constitutional analysis.  See, e.g., 2017 FISC Op., at 15-18 (describing prohibition on U.S.-person\nqueries of Upstream information).  See also 2020 FISC Op., at 6 (“the [targeting, querying, and\nminimization]  procedures  as  a  whole  must  be  consistent  with  statutory  and  constitutional\nrequirements”).\nThe procedures regulating access to Section 702 databases raise fundamental Fourth\nAmendment questions.  As the Second Circuit cautioned herein,\nIf such a vast body of information is simply stored in a database,\navailable for review by request from domestic law enforcement\nagencies solely on the speculative possibility that evidence of interest\nto agents investigating a particular individual might be found there,\nthe program begins to look more like a dragnet, and a query more like\na general warrant, and less like an individual officer going to the\nimplications of bulk data collection.”  See Machtinger, at 2.  While “[i]gnoring Carpenter in\ndeciding Hasbajrami might make sense under a narrow reading of Carpenter, which focuses\nsolely on CSLI, [] dicta from Carpenter about applying the Fourth Amendment in the era of\nmodern technology may support a more robust constitutional analysis of incidental collection\nunder Section 702.”  Id. (footnote omitted).  Thus, “[w]hile Carpenter’s dicta are non-binding,\nthey may provide insight into how the Supreme Court might address other forms of bulk data\ncollection, like the collection in Hasbajrami, in the future.”  Id.\n37\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 51 of 143 PageID #:\n2205\nevidence locker to check a previously-acquired piece of evidence\nagainst some newfound insight.\nHasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 671.  See also Machtinger, at 14 (“the court expressed some concern about\nthe breadth, comprehensive reach, and automatic nature of Section 702,” and “seemed to seriously\nconsider that querying should receive greater Fourth Amendment protection than it currently does”)\n(footnotes omitted);  Muhtorov, 2021 WL 5817486, at *84 (Lucero, J., dissenting) (noting “the\nthorny constitutional issues that querying presents”).\nAs the Supreme Court has explained in the context of programmatic stops, such as traffic\ncheckpoints, “[a] search or seizure is ordinarily unreasonable in the absence of individualized\nsuspicion of wrongdoing.”  City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32, 37 (2000), citing Chandler\nv. Miller, 520 U.S. 305, 308 (1997). \nAcutely conscious of these basic constitutional tenets, the Court “ha[s] recognized only\nlimited circumstances in which the usual rule does not apply.”  Edmond, 531 U.S. at 37.  In\naccordance with that principle, the Supreme Court has consistently determined that government\nprograms that authorize its agents to conduct seizures – such as those attendant to vehicle\ncheckpoints – without “the appropriate quantum of particularized suspicion,” must pass Fourth\nAmendment muster.  Id., at 34-5.  See also Muhtorov, 2021 WL 5817486, at *88 n.32 (Lucero, J.,\ndissenting) (“[a]s the court held in Riley, mere seizure does not authorize search of contents”).\nIn addition, “[w]hile reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is predominantly an\nobjective inquiry, [the Court’s] special needs and administrative search cases demonstrate that\npurpose is often relevant when suspicionless intrusions pursuant to a general scheme are at issue.” \nEdmond, 531 U.S. at 47 (“a checkpoint program whose primary purpose was to detect evidence of\n38\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 52 of 143 PageID #:\n2206\nordinary criminal wrongdoing” is not sufficient to justify suspicionless seizures of private citizens). \nCf. Michigan Dep't of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444, 450 (1990) (curbing drunk driving was a\npressing enough state interest to justify the brief  “suspicionless seizures” that occur at checkpoints); \nUnited States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 545 (1976) (“[i]nterdicting the flow of illegal\nentrants from Mexico poses formidable law enforcement problems,” thus justifying a brief seizure\nat a permanent checkpoint to ascertain immigration status). \nIn determining whether such programs are designed consistent with the Fourth Amendment,\n“the Court examine[s] the government interests advanced to justify such routine intrusions ‘upon the\nconstitutionally protected interests of the private citizen,’” to determine whether “under the\ncircumstances the government interests outweighed those of the private citizen.” Martinez-Fuerte,\n428 U.S. at 561, citing Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523 (1967). \nHowever, in checkpoint cases, the Court emphasized that it examines government programs\nor actions involving searches24 with a much more stringent standard than that of the seizures\ndiscussed above.  See Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. at 561 (“the [use of the balancing test] is\nappropriate here, where we deal neither with searches nor with the sanctity of private dwellings,\nordinarily afforded the most stringent Fourth Amendment protection”).  Indeed, the Court has “held\nthat checkpoint searches are constitutional only if justified by consent or probable cause to search.” \nId., citing  United States v. Ortiz, 422 U.S. 891 (1975). \n24   “When an individual ‘seeks to preserve something as private,’ and his expectation of\nprivacy is ‘one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable,’ we have held that official\nintrusion into that private sphere generally qualifies as a search and requires a warrant supported\nby probable cause.”  Carpenter, 138 S. Ct. at 2213, citing Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 740\n(1979).\n39\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 53 of 143 PageID #:\n2207\nHere, the immense breadth of the Government’s collection under Section 702, described\nante, at 8-19, coupled with its ability to query the resulting databases for the emails of U.S. persons\nlike Mr. Hasbajrami, is the initial subject for review.  Compare In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1015\n(“Government assures us that it does not maintain a database of incidentally collected information\nfrom non-targeted United States persons”).\nAccordingly, the Section 702 querying program as a whole – again, an issue of first\nimpression outside the ex parte context of the FISC – is ripe for review to determine whether or not\nit violates the Fourth Amendment.\n3.  Even if the Warrant Requirement Does Not Apply, Section 702 Backdoor \nQueries Must Satisfy the Fourth Amendment’s “Reasonableness” Requirement\nEven if, assuming arguendo, a warrant is not required to conduct a Section 702 query, such\na search must still be reasonable under Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.  As the Circuit explained\nin its opinion, “[f]or today we need only reiterate that ‘the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth\nAmendment is reasonableness.’” Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 672, (quoting Riley, 573 U.S. at 381, and\ncf. Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d at 121-22).\nIt is well settled that the reasonableness of electronic surveillance is evaluated under “the\ntotality  of  the  circumstances”  –  which  includes  the  breadth  and  volume  of  the\ninformation/communications  intercepted,  as  well  as  the  rules  dictating  how  those  sensitive\ncommunications may be acquired, retained, and used.  See, e.g., In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1012; \n2011 FISC Op., at *27-28.  In FISC proceedings, the government has conceded that the querying\nrules bear directly on reasonableness.  See [Redacted], Mem. Op. at 40 (FISA Ct. Nov. 6, 2015),\navailable at bit/ly/3487WWE.  See also Muhtorov, 2021 WL 5817486, at *24.\n40\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 54 of 143 PageID #:\n2208\nThe reasonableness standard is well-defined for electronic surveillance:  courts consider the\nadequacy of procedures regulating the government’s intrusions into privacy, including the strength\nor weakness of the applicable minimization protocols.  See, e.g., Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41,\n58 (1967);  In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d 717, 737-41 (FISA Ct. Rev. 2002);  United States v.\nDuggan, 743 F.2d 59, 73-74 (2d Cir. 1984) (analyzing “the procedures fashioned in FISA”);  2018\nFISC Op., 402 F. Supp. 3d at 75 (explaining that “the rules for U.S.-person queries are especially\nimportant for minimization of Section 702 information”).\nAlso, because electronic surveillance presents “inherent dangers” of overbreadth, see\nBerger, 388 U.S. at 60, the lawfulness of particular surveillance depends on the safeguards attendant\nto the acquisition, retention, and use of the private information the government intercepts.  See In\nre Directives, 551 F.3d 1004, 1012 (FISA Ct. Rev. 2008);  2011 FISC Op., at *27-28. The querying\nrules go to the heart of this analysis because, as the Circuit and the FISC have recognized, they pose\na considerable threat to the privacy of U.S. persons’ electronic communications.  See Hasbajrami,\n945 F.3d at 672 (“[t]reating querying as a Fourth Amendment event and requiring the query itself\nto be reasonable provides a backstop to protect the privacy interests of United States persons and\nensure that they are not being improperly targeted”);  2018 FISC Op., 402 F. Supp. 3d at 87 (“[t]he\nCourt regards the privacy interests at stake as substantial”) (emphasis added).  \nIndeed, the FISC reiterated that (as cited earlier in its opinion), “the FBI has conducted tens\nof thousands of unjustified queries of Section 702 data[,]” and “[b]ased on the information available\n– e.g., queries for [redacted] and for persons with access to FBI facilities – it appears that many\nsubjects of those queries were U.S. persons.”  2018 FISC Op. 402 F. Supp.3d at 87.\n41\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 55 of 143 PageID #:\n2209\nWhile the FISC found it “difficult on the record before [it] to assess to what extent\nU.S.-person information was returned and examined as a result of those queries[,]” at the very least\n“the reported querying practices present a serious risk of unwarranted intrusion into the private\ncommunications of a large number of U.S. persons.”  2018 FISC Op. 402 F. Supp.3d at 87.\nSimilar to the Carpenter Court’s concern about the sheer amount of CSLI being stored and\nqueried,25 the Second Circuit herein noted “the vast technological capabilities of the Section 702\nprogram, estimated by the PCLOB as totaling nearly 250 million e-mails annually by 2011 and likely\nlarger numbers since then.”  Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 671. \nThe requisite evaluation entails an objective analysis that examines the breadth of the search\nand the restrictions on how the government may exploit the resulting information;  it is not\ncontrolled by post hoc claims regarding which of the intercepted communications the government\nultimately intends to rely on at trial.  See Berger, 388 U.S. at 60 (examining defects in the statutory\nprocedures).\n4.  Suppression Necessarily Encompasses the “Fruit of the Poisonous Tree”\nThe “fruit of the poisonous tree” doctrine requires suppression whenever the tainted search\nor seizure played a direct or indirect role in developing an investigation and evidence.  The Second\nCircuit made application of that principle quite clear in this case in various parts of its opinion. \n25  The Court in Carpenter repeatedly highlighted the sheer number of people, devices,\nand discreet communications collected, stored, and potentially queried over a significant period\nof time – a factor relevant to the massive scale of communications collected in the national\nsecurity realm.  See, e.g., 138 S. Ct. at 2218 (“[c]ritically, because location information is\ncontinually logged for all of the 400 million devices in the United States – not just those\nbelonging to persons who might happen to come under investigation – this newfound tracking\ncapacity runs against everyone”);  id., at 2219 (“[t]he Government’s position fails to contend\nwith the seismic shifts in digital technology that made possible the tracking of not only\nCarpenter’s location but also everyone else’s, not for a short period but for years and years”).\n42\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 56 of 143 PageID #:\n2210\nAs the Circuit recognized, the government’s argument on appeal – that it could restrict the\nanalysis to whether any of the specific information gleaned from backdoor searches itself constituted\nprojected trial evidence – did not correctly state the standard.  See Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 672-74. \nSee also ante, at 26.\nRather, evaluating broad electronic searches, like wiretaps, courts consider even those aspects\nof the intrusion – from acquisition, to retention, to use – that do not yield evidence as tainting the\nfruits that are used as evidence.  That is not a piecemeal exercise that depends on tracing each defect\nin the surveillance to the government’s evidence at trial.  Id.  See also United States v. Suggs, 998\nF.3d 1125, 1142 (10th Cir. 2021) (“this so-called ‘fruit of the poisonous tree’ doctrine does not\ndemand a particularly tight causal chain between the illegal search and the discovery of the evidence\nsought to be suppressed”).\nIn fact, as the Second Circuit has directed here, the Supreme Court has expressly held that,\nwhen evaluating broad electronic searches, a court must consider even those aspects of the intrusion\nthat do not lead to evidence at trial.  In Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128 (1978), the Supreme\nCourt weighed, as part of its Fourth Amendment analysis, the government’s interception of seven\nphone  calls  between  the  defendant  and  her  mother  –  notwithstanding  that  “none  of  these\nconversations turned out to be material to the investigation at hand.”  Scott, 436 U.S. at 142-43.  See\nalso, e.g., Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41, 55, 58-60 (1967);  United States v. Hyde, 574 F.2d 856,\n870 (5th Cir. 1978) (analyzing interception of privileged communications that did not produce\nevidence of conspiracy);  United States v.

See, e.g., Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. \n471, 486-88 (1963) (articulating “fruit of the poisonous tree” doctrine, under which court must\nexamine whether evidence was “come at by the exploitation” of an unlawful search);  Murray v.\nUnited States, 487 U.S. 533, 536-37 (1988) (describing right to seek suppression of evidence\n“derived” from an unlawful search).26\nAs the Supreme Court instructed in Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165 (1969), in the\ncontext of electronic surveillance, the examination is particularly fact-intensive.  Id., at 168, 180-85. \nThat scrutiny should be even more exacting here given the government’s consistently penurious\ninterpretation of what it means for evidence to be “derived” from its electronic surveillance.  See,\ne.g., Patrick C. Toomey, “Why Aren’t Criminal Defendants Getting Notice of Section 702\nSurveillance – Again?” Just Security, December 11, 2015, available at https://bit.ly/32eUu70.\nNor has the government even publicly provided its definition of “derived,” which accords\nit unwarranted flexibility in avoiding disclosure and, ultimately, suppression.  The government’s\nresistance to transparency further reinforces the indispensability of adversarial participation and\nlitigation in the process, as detailed post, at 82-103.\n26  As detailed post, at 82-96, an informed decision with respect to this issue is not arrived\nat ex parte.  See Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, 168, 180-85. (1969).\n44\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 58 of 143 PageID #:\n2212\nAlso, limiting Fourth Amendment analysis to whether the intrusion into privacy produced\ntrial evidence would essentially turn the prohibition against general warrants on its head, as\ninnocuous or non-pertinent communications would not be relevant to the determination – yet it is\nthe collection, retention, and use of those very communications that is protected most.27\nThat  approach  is  appropriate  because  searches  of  electronic/digital  information  and\ncommunications are often expansive, enabling the government to seize large amounts of\nprivate information that is unrelated to the government’s investigation.  See Ganias, 824 F.3d\n217-18.  While the en banc Court in Ganias relied on the “good faith” exception in reversing the\npanel’s opinion, it cautioned,\n[W]e offer no opinion on the existence of a Fourth Amendment\nviolation in this case, we make some observations bearing on the\nreasonableness of the agents’ actions, both to illustrate the complexity\nof the questions in this significant Fourth Amendment context and to\nhighlight the importance of careful consideration of the technological\ncontours of digital search and seizure for future cases.\nGanias, 824 F.3d at 209. \nIn that context, the en banc Court in Ganias elaborated that it wanted to “highlight the\ncomplexity of the relevant questions for future cases and to underscore the importance, in answering\nsuch questions, of engaging with the technological specifics.”  Id., at 217 (footnote omitted).

The Querying System In 2011 and the Querying In This Case Were Likely Unreasonable\nThe querying system that permits backdoor searches has transformed Section 702 into a\nsystematic tool for untrammeled, and heretofore unreviewable warrantless review of the private\nelectronic communications of U.S. persons like Mr. Hasbajrami, and investigations of those persons\nfor any manner of potential offenses.  Whether in its structure, or specifically as applied to Mr.\nHasbajrami, the Section 702 querying is unreasonable by Fourth Amendment standards.\nCertainly the public record compels a presumption that during the time period at issue herein\n– 2010-2011 – the government was not in compliance with FAA or FISA in a number of critical and\nrelevant aspects.  In August 2013 the government began releasing declassified versions of a series\nof FISC opinions, continuing through 2021, that have catalogued the abuses and transgressions –\nexceeding the authority granted by the FISC – the government committed in the course of\nimplementing Section 702 programs and surveillance/acquisition.\nMost recently, FISC opinions in 2018 and 2020 provided an illuminating window into the\nmechanics of Section 702 querying, and its unreasonableness under the Fourth Amendment.  In the\n2018 FISC Op., for example, the FISC reaffirmed that “[t]he government is not at liberty to do\nwhatever it wishes with those U.S.-person communications, notwithstanding that they are ‘incidental\n46\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 60 of 143 PageID #:\n2214\ncollections occurring as a result of’ authorized acquisitions.”  2018 FISC Op., 402 F. Supp.3d at 87,\n(quoting In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1015). \nAs the FISC pointed out, “[t]he FISCR in In re Directives relied on the government’s\nassurance  ‘that  it  does  not  maintain  a  database  of  incidentally  collected  information  from\nnon-targeted United States persons’ when it held on the facts of that case that ‘incidentally collected\ncommunications of non-targeted United States persons do not violate the Fourth Amendment.’”  Id. \nYet that is not necessarily the case any longer (if it ever was an accurate representation).  As\nthe FISC recognized, “while the FBI may not maintain a separate database of U.S.-person\ncommunications acquired under Section 702, it routinely queries raw Section 702 data in order to\nidentify and examine communications of particular U.S. persons.”  Id.28\nIn turn, the FISC reasoned, “[w]hether those querying practices adequately protect the privacy\nof those U.S. persons, or instead unjustifiably invade U.S. persons’ privacy, bears on the analysis of\nreasonableness under the Fourth Amendment.”  Id., citing In re Certified Question, 858 F.3d 591,\n609 (FISA Ct. Rev. 2016) (per curiam) (examining intra-FBI restrictions on access to information\nacquired pursuant to a FISA pen register/trap-and-trace authorization as part of assessment of Fourth\nAmendment reasonableness).\n1.  The Routine and Extraordinarily Expansive Scope of Section 702 Querying\nSection 702 querying is not treated as an extraordinary procedure.  Rather, it is the default. \nAs the FISC reported, the “FBI encourages its personnel to make maximal use of queries – provided\n28  The FISC added that “[t]he large number of U.S.-person queries run by the FBI makes\nits querying practices significant, despite its receiving only a small percentage of the total\ninformation acquired under Section 702.”  2018 FISC Op., 402 F. Supp.3d at 75.\n47\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 61 of 143 PageID #:\n2215\nthey are compliant with the FBI’s minimization procedures and other applicable law – in order to\nperform their work.”  2018 FISC Op., at 80.  \nQuerying is also implemented as a first resort at the start of the investigative process:  “it is\n‘a routine and encouraged practice for the FBI to query’ 702 information in furtherance of authorized\nintelligence and law-enforcement activities, including when ‘making an initial decision to open an\nassessment.’”  Id., (quoting 2016 FBI Minimization Procedures §III.D at 11 n.3).  See also id.,\n(quoting a Supplemental FBI Declaration (submitting to the FISC), at 6 (“FBI uses queries, among\nother reasons, ‘to quickly determine whether a new tip or lead . . . warrants opening an investigation,\nis related to an existing investigation,’ or requires no further action”)).\nThe standard is not probable cause, but instead far more elastic:  “there must be ‘a reasonable\nbasis to expect [it] will return foreign intelligence information or evidence of crime.’”  2018 FISC\nOp., at 76.  Nor did the querying rules impose any accountability.  As discussed post, at 53-54, the\nFBI did not even require agents to memorialize the bases for targeting a U.S. person through a\nbackdoor search.  2018 FISC Op., at 52-53, 79. \nThe absence of such a fundamental requirement made effective oversight difficult, if not\nimpossible.  Id.  As a result, without any articulable demonstration of suspicion, an FBI agent could\nenter in the datebase(s) a U.S. person’s name, email address, or telephone number, and retrieve\nwhatever trove of communications Section 702 has vacuumed into its collection during the prior five\nyears.  Queries thus represented a free pass for accessing protected communications that, otherwise,\nwould be inaccessible without a warrant or probable cause.\nOther aspects of Section 702 queries distinguish them from any traditional review of\nelectronic interceptions.  For instance, the majority of Section 702 interceptions are not manually\n48\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 62 of 143 PageID #:\n2216\nreviewed, in real-time or otherwise.  See PCLOB Report 128-129 (“NSA analysts do not review all\nor even most communications”).  \nAs the Second Circuit and the FISC have pointed out, that is not surprising considering the\nbillions of communications stored for years;  therefore, many communications would never be\nexamined by an agent absent a backdoor search.  See Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 671;  2018 FISC Op.,\nat 75.  See also United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. 400, 415-16 (2012) (Sotomayor, J., concurring)\n(28-day long GPS monitoring of defendant’s movements was, for Fourth Amendment purposes,\nqualitatively different than ordinary visual surveillance);  id., at 429-30 (Alito, J., concurring).29\nAlso, a Section 702 query is comprehensive.  While an agent might review a small subset of\ncommunications in the course of pursuing a foreign target, a backdoor search is a deliberate effort\nto retrieve all of a U.S. person’s communications resident in the Section 702 databases.  See\nHasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 672 (“querying is problematic because it may make it easier to target\nwide-ranging information about a given United States person”).  See also Muhtorov, 2021 WL\n5817486, at 88 n.31 (Lucero, J., dissenting) (“[t]he 250,000,000+ communications that are collected\nannually under §702, however, are not documented in real time.  Instead, they are stored, often\nwithout processing, in vast lakes of data, and their contents are most often obtained through\nquerying”), citing PCLOB Report, at 59, 116.\nIn  that  context,  in  applying  Section  702  programmatic  electronic  surveillance,  the\ngovernment targets not only individuals, “but also groups, entities, associations, corporations, or\n29  The formal ground for the principal ruling in Jones was that a trespass had occurred. \nHowever, even the plurality opinion acknowledged that “[i]t may be that achieving the same\n[tracking] result through electronic means, without an accompanying trespass, is an\nunconstitutional invasion of privacy, but the present case does not require us to answer that\nquestion.”  Jones, 565 U.S. at 412.\n49\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 63 of 143 PageID #:\n2217\nforeign powers.”  PCLOB Report, at 20-21.  Thus, an entire foreign government can constitute a\nsingle target.  Id.  Moreover, for each targeted individual or group, the government may monitor any\nand all “selectors” – phone numbers, email addresses, IP addresses, or other identifiers – that it\nbelieves are associated with the target.  See Charlie Savage, et al., “Hunting for Hackers, NSA\nSecretly Expands Internet Spying at U.S. Border,” The New York Times, June 4, 2015, available at\nnyti.ms/2RfT9Us.30\nSome of the selectors may be used by hundreds of different people, and because the threshold\nfor targeting is so low, the number of surveillance targets ballooned to more than 200,000 annually\nby 2019.  See ante, at 14.  Every single communication between a U.S. person and one of these\nindividuals or groups is collected and stored in the government’s databases, and accessible via\nquerying.\n2. The History of Non-Compliance and Abuse of Section 702 Querying Authority\nThe history of government – whether DoJ or FBI or NSA – non-compliance with even the\nrelaxed strictures imposed by FISA is too voluminous and multifaceted to present herein.  Even the\ncomprehensive review below represents only a fraction of the abuses that have continually invaded\nthe privacy of U.S. persons in manners that exceed either or both statutory or constitutional authority. \nSee, e.g., ACLU v. Clapper, 785 F.3d 787 (2d Cir. 2015) (addressing an entirely different FISA\nprogram);  United States v. Moalin, 973 F.3d 977, 984, 996 (9th Cir. 2020) (same program – the\n30  The Fourth Amendment's protections do not depend on whom the goverment purports\nto be “targeting.”  They turn on what it is searching.  See Orin Kerr, “The Surprisingly Weak\nReasoning of Mohamud,” Lawfare (Dec.23, 2016), available at bit.ly/2PfkPWx (“there is no\n‘targeting’ doctrine in Fourth Amendment law”).\n50\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 64 of 143 PageID #:\n2218\nSection 215 [50 U.S.C. §1861] bulk telephony metadata collection program – violated the statute\nand may have violated the Fourth Amendment, but violations were harmless).\nCertainly, as a whole, the FISC’s opinions show how a surveillance program ostensibly\ndesigned to monitor, intercept, and collect hundreds of thousands of foreign “targets” has been\nengineered to afford law enforcement and intelligence agents functionally bruntrammeled access to\nthe communications of U.S. persons, which communications would otherwise be inaccessible absent\na warrant. \nAs the FISC revealed in its 2020 opinion, queries “had been conducted in support of\npredicated criminal investigations relating to health-care fraud, transnational organized crime, violent\ngangs, domestic terrorism involving racially motivated violent extremists, as well as investigations\nrelating to public corruption and bribery.”  2020 FISC Op., at 42.31  Yet, as the FISC pointed out,\n“[n]one of these queries was related to national security, and they returned numerous Section\n702-acquired products in response.”  Id. (citation omitted);  see also 2018 FISC Op., at 75 (“FBI\nqueries intended to retrieve evidence of crime may be conducted in the course of law-enforcement\ninvestigations that are unrelated to national-security threats”).32\n31  An exception, at 50 U.S.C. §1881a(f)(2)(E), with extraordinarily latitude permits\naccess to Section 702 databases if the FBI believes the results “could assist in mitigating or\neliminating a threat to life or serious bodily harm.”\n32  In its annual report to the FISC regarding the volume of queries used in connection\nwith investigation of non-national security offenses, FBI reported one such incident in 2019, but\nin its 2020 report amended that number to 91 such instances for 2019, although “[t]he real\nnumber was probably larger;  the report said it counted all queries by a single persona on a single\nday as just one episode.”  Charlie Savage, “National Security Surveillance Plummeted Amid\nPandemic and Russia Inquiry Fallout,” The New York Times, April 30, 2021, available at\nhttps://nyti.ms/328vKwu.\n51\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 65 of 143 PageID #:\n2219\nIndeed, the 2018 FISC Op. devotes pages to summarizing the incidents and categories of non-\ncompliance with and abuse of Section 702 querying.  2018 FISC Op., at 76-78.  The FISC concluded\nthat the improper queries directed at U.S. persons were not reasonably likely to result in foreign\nintelligence information or evidence of a crime, and included searches for information concerning\nrelatives, potential witnesses, and potential informants.  Id.\nIn fact, the FISC disclosed that the “the FBI has conducted tens of thousands of unjustified\nqueries of Section 702 data.”  2018 FISC Op., at 87.  In addition, the FISC explained that the\nproblems mushroom beyond the initial transgression:  “[i]n a number of cases, a single improper\ndecision or assessment resulted in the use of query terms corresponding to a large number of\nindividuals, including U.S. persons.”  Id., at 76.33\nSubsequently, the 2020 FISC Op. listed specific improprieties, such as 69 improper queries\nby a terrorism task-force officer, 2020 FISC Op., at 40, “[o]ther reported violations [that] apparently\n33  A 2018 amendment to FISA required a warrant “in only a small subset of cases –\ncriminal investigations not relating to national security that had reached a certain stage of the\ninvestigation – and only after the query is conducted (but before reviewing the contents of any\ncommunications).”  See  Elizabeth Goitein, “ODNI’s 2019 Statistical Transparency Report: The\nFBI Violates FISA … Again,” Just Security, May 11, 2020 (“Goitein”), available at\nhttps://bit.ly/3F4aUgn.  Yet through the end of 2020 the FBI had completely ignored that\nminimal requirement.  As Ms. Goitein, Co-Director of the Liberty & National Security Program\nat New York University Law School’s Brennan Center for Justice, reported, ODNI’s 2019\nTransparency Report, available at https://bit.ly/3sfPKsb, “reveal[ed] that the FBI has failed to\ncomply with it in literally every relevant case.”  Goitein.  A table in the ODNI 2019\nTransparency Report cited six instances in 2018 “in which the FBI reviewed the contents of\nAmericans’ communications after conducting a backdoor search in a criminal, non-national\nsecurity case.”  Id.;  see also ODNI 2019 Transparency Report, at 17.  While the “six instances\nwent unreported in the 2018 transparency report because they were not detected until a\nDepartment of Justice oversight review in 2019[,]” that “table indicates that the FBI obtained a\nwarrant to review the contents of those communications exactly zero times.”  Goitein.  Likewise,\n“for 2019, the table lists one instance in which the FBI ran a backdoor search in a criminal,\nnon-national security case and reviewed communications content, but zero instances in which it\nobtained a warrant.”  Id.  Each instance was characterized as a “compliance incident.”  Id.\n52\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 66 of 143 PageID #:\n2220\nresulted from the failure of FBI personnel to opt out of querying raw FISA-acquired information[,]”\nid., “as well as conducting overly broad queries.”  Id., at 41.  See also 2017 FISC Op., at 82 (“NSA\nexamined all queries using identifiers for ‘U.S. persons targeted pursuant to Sections 704 and 705(b)\n. . . using the [redacted] tool in [redacted] . . . from November 1, 2015 to May 1, 2016[,]’” and\n“[b]ased on that examination, ‘NSA estimates that approximately eighty-five percent of those\nqueries, representing [redacted] queries conducted by approximately [redacted] targeted offices, were\nnot compliant with the applicable minimization procedures”) (emphasis added) (citations omitted)\n(footnote omitted).34\nMoreover, the 2018 FISC Op. expressed dismay that the intentionally unauthorized queries\n“do not present the same level of concern as those that evidence misunderstanding of the querying\nstandard.”  Id., at 78.  Nor was the FISC even able to identify the level of non-compliance with\nprecision or confidence because of the FBI’s failure to adhere to the statutory record-keeping\nrequirements.  See also Muhtorov, 2021 WL 5817486, at *87 (Lucero, J., dissenting) (noting the\n“FBI’s documented history of widespread U.S. person querying and of non-compliance with its\nrecord-keeping responsibilities under its own minimization procedures”), citing PCLOB Report, at\n59.\nThat delinquency made it impossible to verify critical distinctions – contrary to the statutory\ndirective – between queries of U.S. persons and those of foreigners.  For instance, as the FISC\nrecounted,\n34  Nor was that 85% error rate deemed anomalous.  As the 2017 FISC Op. added,\n“[w]hile the government reports that it is unable to provide a reliable estimate of the number of\nnon-compliant queries since 2012, id., there is no apparent reason to believe the November\n2015-April 2016 period coincided with an unusually high error rate.”  Id., at 82.\n53\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 67 of 143 PageID #:\n2221\n[t]he querying procedures did not require FBI personnel to document\nthe basis for finding that each United States-person query term\nsatisfied the relevant standard – i.e., that queries be reasonably\ndesigned to return foreign-intelligence information or evidence of\ncrime.\n2018 FISC Op., at 52.\nIn response to FBI’s protest that its procedures were adequate, and the statute’s too\nburdensome, the FISC admonished that “[r]egardless of how persuasive the FBI’s considerations\nmay be, the Court is not free to substitute its understanding of sound policy – or, for that matter, the\nunderstanding of the Director of the FBI – for the clear command of the statute.”  Id., at 72, citing\n14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett, 556 U.S. 247, 270 (2009) (“[a]bsent a constitutional barrier, ‘it is not\nfor us to substitute our view of . . . policy for the legislation which has been passed by Congress’”)\n(other citations omitted).  Thus, “[i]n sum, the Court is merely enforcing what Section 702(t)(1)(B)\nplainly imposes.”  Id.\nOther facets of FBI’s querying also troubled the FISC.  Querying did not require any showing\nof individual suspicion;  any required high-level approval;  any restrictions on use of the resulting\ninformation; and/or any requirement that irrelevant or innocent information be promptly destroyed. \n2018 FISC Op., at 73-80.\nUltimately, the FISC concluded that FBI’s permissive rules for searching through U.S.\npersons’ communications rendered the surveillance unreasonable under the statute and the Fourth\nAmendment.  2018 FISC Op. at 86-88.  The lack of sufficient record-keeping constituted one\nstatutory and perhaps constitutional deficiency:  “[w]ithout such documentation and in view of\nreported instances of non-compliance with that standard, the procedures seemed unreasonable under\n54\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 68 of 143 PageID #:\n2222\nFISA’s definition of ‘minimization procedures’ and possibly the Fourth Amendment.”  Id., at 52. \nSee also id., at 75.\nIn reaching its constitutional determination, the FISC explained that\n[b]ecause the FBI procedures, as implemented, have involved a large\nnumber of unjustified queries conducted to retrieve information about\nU.S. persons, they are not reasonably designed, in light of the purpose\nand technique of Section 702 acquisitions, to minimize the retention\nand prohibit the dissemination of private U.S. person information.\n2018 FISC Op., at 82.\nFurther explicating its reasoning, the FISC noted that “[h]ere, there are demonstrated risks\nof serious error and abuse, and the Court has found the government's procedures do not sufficiently\nguard against that risk, for reasons explained above in the discussion of statutory minimization\nrequirements.”  Id., at 88. \nTwo years later, the problems of non-compliance and abuse remained.  As the 2020 FISC Op.\npointed out, “NSD has reported a number of compliance incidents that were discovered during\noversight reviews at FBI field offices, which suggest that the FBI’s failure to properly\napply its querying standard when searching Section 702-acquired information was more\npervasive than was previously believed.”  Id., at 39 (emphasis added).\nThus, “the Court continue[d] to be concerned about FBI querying practices involving\nU.S.-person query terms, including (1)  application of the substantive standard for conducting\nqueries;  (2)  queries that are designed to retrieve evidence of crime that is not foreign-intelligence\ninformation;  and (3)  record keeping and documentation requirements.”  Id.  See also 2017 FISC\nOp., at 19 (“[s]ince 2011, NSA’s minimization procedures have prohibited use of U.S.-person\nidentifiers to query the results of upstream Internet collection under Section 702.

As the Circuit\nrecognized, any improved querying rules “were not in place” during the very period in which Mr.\nHasbajrami’s communications were intercepted (April 2, 2011, through August 28, 2011), and\nsubsequently queried.  Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 658.35\nIndeed, the record continues to support the conclusion that FBI agents conducted backdoor\nsearches as part of their investigation of Mr. Hasbajrami, as agents do “whenever the FBI opens a\nnew national security investigation or assessment[,]”  PCLOB Report, at 59, and that in the process\nviolated the Fourth Amendment and the statute.  See also Muhtorov, 2021 WL 5817486, at *86\n35  The Court in Muhtorov pointed out that the provisions in the FISA Amendments\nReauthorization Act of 2017, Pub. L.

The same is true here:  neither statutory reform designed to protect Fourth Amendment\nrights existed during the time frame of the 2011 investigation of Mr. Hasbajrami.\nNevertheless, as the dissent in Muhtorov noted, “although the statute did not mandate\nrecord-keeping requirements concerning queries of U.S. persons as a distinct category until 2018,\nthe minimization procedures applicable at the time of the investigation into Muhtorov required\nthe maintenance of records of all search terms used to query §702 databases, which would have\nincluded searches using identifiers associated with Muhtorov.”  Muhtorov, at *86 n.26 (Lucero,\nJ., dissenting), citing PCLOB Report, at 58-59 (“FBI minimization procedures also permit the\nFBI to query unminimized Section 702-acquired data[,] . . . [and requires the FBI] to maintain\nrecords of all terms used to query content”).\n56\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 70 of 143 PageID #:\n2224\n(Lucero, J., dissenting) (“[i]t blinks reality to assert that, in this one instance, the FBI did not follow\nits  standard  operating  procedure  of  querying  §702  data  when  opening  a  national  security\ninvestigation”).\nAlthough the secrecy and the complexity of the querying procedures have obscured their\nFourth Amendment and statutory deficits for nearly a decade, the subsequent FISC opinions have\nlaid  bare  the  broad  invasion  they  licensed  with  respect  to  the  privacy  of  U.S.  persons’\ncommunications that occurred in practice.  Unless the government can establish that the multiple and\nfatal statutory and constitutional flaws identified by the FISC – all reportedly in place during the\nperiod Mr. Hasbajrami was subject to Section 702 surveillance and querying – were not, in fact,\npresent, contrary to these now-unsealed FISC opinions and related independent oversight reports,\nthen those statutory and constitutional flaws render the backdoor searches of his communications\nunreasonable as a matter of law.\n3.  Earlier FISC Disclosure of Non-Compliance with Section 702 Procedures\nThe persistent problems with Section 702 were recognized even earlier than in the 2018 FISC\nOp.  In the 2011 FISC Op., at *5, n.14, Judge Bates, Chief Judge of the FISC at the time, excoriated\nthe NSA for exceeding its acquisition authority and making repeated misrepresentations to the FISC\nregarding NSA’s activities during the period in which Mr. Hasbajrami’s communications were\nmonitored and intercepted pursuant to Section 702 (50 U.S.C. §1881a).  \nAs described in the CRS Report: Overview, Judge Bates was evaluating “the targeting and\nminimization procedures proposed by the government to address new information regarding the\nscope of upstream collection.”  CRS Report: Overview, at 13 (footnotes omitted).  The CRS Report:\nOverview continued that “[s]pecifically, the government had recently discovered that its upstream\n57\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 71 of 143 PageID #:\n2225\ncollection activities had acquired unrelated international communications as well as wholly domestic\ncommunications due to technological limitations.”  Id. (footnotes omitted).  \nIn response, Judge Bates “found the proposed minimization procedures to be deficient on\nstatutory and constitutional grounds.”  Id. (footnotes omitted).  According to the CRS Report:\nOverview, \n[w]ith respect to the statutory requirements, the FISC noted that the\ngovernment’s  proposed  minimization  procedures  were  focused\n“almost exclusively” on information that an analyst wished to use and\nnot  on  the  larger  set  of  information  that  had  been  acquired.\nConsequently, communications that were known to be unrelated to a\ntarget, including those that were potentially wholly domestic, could\nbe retained for up to five years so long as the government was not\nseeking to use that information.\nId. (footnote omitted).\nThe CRS Report: Overview noted that Judge Bates concluded that “this had the effect of\nmaximizing the retention of such information, and was not consistent with FISA’s mandate to\nminimize the retention of U.S. person information.”  Id. (footnote omitted).  See ante, at 17-18.\nIn his opinion, Judge Bates noted the pervasive nature of the violations.  For example, Judge\nBates stated “[t]he court is troubled that the government’s revelations regarding NSA’s acquisition\nof Internet transactions mark the third instance in less than three years in which the government has\ndisclosed a substantial misrepresentation regarding the scope of a major collection program.”  2011\nFISC Op., at *5, n.14 (emphasis added).\nJudge Bates further noted that the government’s submissions in that proceeding made it clear\nthat the NSA had been acquiring Internet transactions even before the FISC’s first approval thereof,\nid., at *17  n.45, adding that:\n58\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 72 of 143 PageID #:\n2226\n!  “[t]he Court’s review of the targeting and minimization procedures submitted with\nthe April 2011 Submissions is complicated by the government’s recent revelation\nthat NSA’s acquisition of Internet communications through its upstream collection\nunder Section 702 is accomplished by acquiring Internet ‘transactions,’ which may\ncontain a single, discrete communication, or multiple discrete communications,\nincluding communications that are neither to, from, nor about targeted facilities, June\n1 Submission at 1-2.  That revelation fundamentally alters the Court’s understanding\nof the scope of the collection conducted pursuant to Section 702 and requires careful\nreexamination of many of the assessments and presumptions underlying its prior\napprovals.”  Id., at *5.\n!  “for the first time, the government has now advised the Court that the volume and\nnature of the information it has been collecting is fundamentally different than what\nthe Court had been led to believe.”  Id., at 9;\n!  “the Court is also unable to find that NSA’s targeting and minimization procedures,\nas the government proposes to implement them in connection with MCT’s [multi-\ncommunication transactions], are consistent with the Fourth Amendment.”  Id., at 9;\n!  “NSA’s minimization procedures, as the government proposes to apply them to\nMCT’s as to which the ‘active user’ is not known to be a tasked selector, do not meet\nthe requirements of 50 U.S.C. §1881a(e) with respect to retention[.]” Id., at 28;\n!  “[t]he sheer volume of transactions acquired by NSA through its upstream collection\nis such that any meaningful review of the entire body of transactions is not feasible.” \nId., at 10;\n59\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 73 of 143 PageID #:\n2227\n!  “the  Court  cannot  know  for  certain  the  exact  number  of  wholly domestic\ncommunications acquired through this collection, nor can it know the number of non-\ntarget communications acquired or the extent to which those communications are to\nor from United States persons or persons in the United States.”  Id., at 10;\n!  “[e]ven if the Court accepts the validity of conclusions derived from statistical\nanalyses, there are significant hurdles in assessing NSA’s upstream collection . . . it\nis impossible to define with any specificity the universe of transactions that will be\nacquired by NSA’s upstream collection at any point in the future.”  Id., at 10;\n!  “the actual number of wholly domestic communications acquired may still be higher\nin view of NSA’s inability conclusively to determine whether a significant portion\nof the MCT’s within its sample contained wholly domestic communications.”  Id.,\nat 11;  and\n!  “the record shows that the government knowingly acquires tens of thousands of\nwholly domestic communications each year.”  Id., at 15.36\nAs a result, Judge Bates required further briefing by the government because “it appeared to\nthe Court that the acquisitions described in [a recent government letter to the Court] exceeded the\nscope of collection previously disclosed by the government and approved by the Court, and might,\nin part, fall outside the scope of Section 702.”  Id., at *2.37\n36  See also Charlie Savage, “N.S.A.

The DoJ Inspector General’s 2019, 2020, and 2021 Reports Detailing \nNon-Compliance with FISA’s Procedural and Substantive Provisions\nThroughout its 43-year existence, FISA’s ex parte culture has created and cultivated, and\npromoted and enabled, the ongoing problems identified with respect to the non-compliance with\nprocedures (and, in turn, the Fourth Amendment) and accuracy of FISA applications.  Some of the\nmost egregious have been made public only since the Second Circuit’s opinion herein.\nThe revelations and conclusions in a series of reports issued by DoJ’s Inspector General\n(“DoJ IG”) illustrate not only the compounding risk of error inherent in a process that operates ex\nparte from start to finish, but also that courts – either the FISC or traditional federal courts – are by\nthemselves not positioned to identify problems, including material misrepresentations and omissions,\nas well as procedural violations, that afflict the government’s FISA process, including querying.  \nThe complexity of the surveillance and the subsequent querying, and the government’s\nreluctance to provide even the Second Circuit with conclusive answers, only amplifies that\nopportunity for concealment and error.

The DoJ Inspector General’s 2019 Report Regarding \nthe Carter Page FISA Applications and Renewals\nIn December 2019 the DoJ IG issued a 476-page Report detailing the many egregious  errors\nand abuse committed by the FBI and the DoJ in the course of applying for and renewing the 2016\nFISA electronic surveillance conducted on Carter Page, at one time Donald J. Trump’s presidential\ncampaign advisor, as part of the investigation denominated “Crossfire Hurricane.”  See OFFICE OF\nTHE INSPECTOR GENERAL, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, Oversight and Review Division 20-012,\nREVIEW OF FOUR FISA APPLICATIONS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE FBI’S CROSSFIRE HURRICANE\nINVESTIGATIONS  (December  9,  2019)  (“December  2019  DoJ  OIG  Report”),  available  at\nbit.ly/2sOu8H4.\nIn reciting in considerable detail the “FBI’s failure to adhere to its own standards of accuracy\nand completeness when filing FISA applications[,]” the December 2019 DoJ IG Report found\n“basic, fundamental, and serious errors during the completion of the FBI' s factual accuracy reviews\n. . . which are designed to ensure that FISA applications contain a full and accurate presentation of\nthe facts.”  Id., at 413.  As a result, it concluded that the FBI “failed to comply with FBI policies, and\nin so doing fell short of what is rightfully expected from a premier law enforcement agency entrusted\nwith such an intrusive surveillance tool.”  Id., at 414.\nThe December 2019 DoJ OIG Report identified 17 separate problems with the FBI’s four\napplications to the FISC (the initial application and three renewal applications) – including repeated\nmisrepresentations, factual inaccuracies, and material omissions.  See id., at viii-xii.  In addition, the\nDecember 2019 DoJ OIG Report’s conclusions negate any claim that the defects in the Page\napplications were unique.\n62\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 76 of 143 PageID #:\n2230\nAs the December 2019 DoJ OIG Report declared, \nThat so many basic and fundamental errors were made by three\nseparate,  hand-picked  teams  on  one  of  the  most  sensitive  FBI\ninvestigations that was briefed to the highest levels within the FBI,\nand that FBI officials expected would eventually be subjected to close\nscrutiny, raised significant questions regarding the FBI chain of\ncommand’s management and supervision of the FISA process. \nId., at xiv.38\nAlso, it was a failure across the entire hierarchy:  “In our view, this was a failure of not only\nthe operational team, but also of the managers and supervisors, including senior officials, in the\nchain of command.”  Id.  Those directly responsible for the applications also concealed information\nfrom superiors:  “the Crossfire Hurricane team failed to inform Department officials of significant\ninformation that was available to the team at the time that the FISA applications were dralted and\nfiled.”  Id., at v.  See also id., at x (describing failure to disclose certain facts to DoJ attorneys).\nAs a result, “[m]uch of that information was inconsistent with, or undercut, the assertions\ncontained in the FISA applications that were used to support probable cause and, in some instances,\nresulted in inaccurate information being included in the applications.”  Id.  See also id., at xiii\n(“agents and supervisors did not give appropriate attention or treatment to the facts that cut against\nprobable  cause,  or  reassess  the  information  supporting  probable  cause  as  the  investigation\nprogressed”).39\n38  Indeed, the December 2019 DoJ IG Report foreshadowed two subsequent reports,\ndiscussed post, at 69-73 and 73-74:  “In addition, given the extensive compliance failures we\nidentified in this review, we believe that additional OIG oversight work is required to assess the\nFBI’s compliance with Department and FBI FISA-related policies that seek to protect the civil\nliberties of U.S. persons.”  Id., at xiv.\n39  See also id., at xiii (“[a]lthough some of the factual misstatements and omissions we\nfound in this review were arguably more significant than others, we believe that all of them taken\n63\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 77 of 143 PageID #:\n2231\nThe  December 2019  DoJ  OIG  Report  identified  “seven significant  inaccuracies and\nomissions” in the initial FISA application “based upon the information known to the FBI” at the\ntime[,]” Id., at viii, including information that rebutted the premises of the application.  For example,\nthe initial application and renewals \n[o]mitted  information  the  FBI  had  obtained  from  another  U.S.\ngovernment  agency  detailing  its  prior  relationship  with  Page,\nincluding that Page had been approved as an “operational contact” for\nthe other agency from 2008 to 2013, and that Page had provided\ninformation to the other agency concerning his prior contacts with\ncertain Russian intelligence officers, one of which overlapped with\nfacts asserted in the FISA application[.]\nId.

The December 2019 DoJ OIG Report “also found no evidence that the\ntogether resulted in FISA applications that made it appear that the information supporting\nprobable cause was stronger than was actually the case”).\n64\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 78 of 143 PageID #:\n2232\nCrossfire Hurricane team requested additional information from the other agency prior to submission\nof the first FISA application in order to deconflict on issues that were relevant to the FISA\napplication.”40\nIn addition, that “failure to provide accurate and complete information to the [NSD Office\nof Intelligence] Attorney concerning Page’s prior relationship with another U.S. government agency\n. . . was particularly concerning because the OI Attorney had specifically asked the case agent in late\nSeptember 2016 whether Carter Page had a current or prior relationship with the other agency.”  Id.,\nat ix.\nMoreover, the application and renewals “overstated the significance” of a source’s reliability,\nand corroboration for that source’s information, and omitted information and statements that were\npart of consensually monitored  conversations, but which were contrary to the portrayal of Page and\nthe investigation the applications and renewals sought to convey to the FISC.  Id., at viii-ix.\nFor example, the initial application “[i]ncluded Page’s consensually monitored statements\nto an FBI [Confidential Human Source] in October 2016 that the FBI believed supported its theory\n40  The December 2019 DoJ OIG Report revealed that even when pertinent information\nwas requested, FBI personnel withheld it:  “[w]hile FISA discussions were ongoing, on or about\nAugust 17, 2016, the Crossfire Hurricane team received information from another U.S.\ngovernment agency relating to Page’s prior relationship with that agency and prior contacts with\nRussian intelligence officers about which the agency was aware.”  Id., at 123.  While “this\ninformation was highly relevant to the potential FISA application, the Crossfire Hurricane team\ndid not engage with the other agency regarding this information until June 2017, just prior to the\nfinal Carter Page FISA renewal application.”  Id. (footnote omitted).  Moreover, “when Case\nAgent 1 was explicitly asked in late September 2016 by the [NSD Office of Intelligence]\nAttorney assisting on the FISA application about Page’s prior relationship with this other agency,\nCase Agent 1 did not accurately describe the nature and extent of the information the FBI\nreceived from the other agency.”  Id.\n65\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 79 of 143 PageID #:\n2233\nthat Page was an agent of Russia but omitted other statements Page made that were inconsistent with\nits theory[.]”  Id., at ix.\nThe malfeasance even included altering an email from a liaison to a U.S. intelligence agency\nto fit the FBI’s version of Page’s status.  In that episode an FBI attorney “altered [the] email by\ninserting the words ‘not a source’ into it, thus making it appear that the liaison had said that Page\nwas ‘not a source’ for the other agency.”  Id., at xiii.  Consequently, “[r]elying upon this altered\nemail,” the supervising FBI Special Agent “signed the third renewal application that again failed to\ndisclose Page’s past relationship with the other agency.”  Id.\nAnother problem the December 2019 DoJ OIG Report illuminated was that “case agents may\nhave improperly substituted their own judgments in place of the judgment of or, or in place of the\ncourt, to weigh the probative value of the information.”  Id.  See also Charlie Savage, “Problems in\nF.B.I.

Whether that information was\nprovided to the FISC (or even to DoJ attorneys or FBI supervisors) or any other decision-maker\nrelative to querying, or factored into the decision to query (and/or was subsequently disclosed in\neither the initial application for Title I and III FISA electronic surveillance of Mr. Hasbajrami, or\nrenewals thereafter), are questions of vital importance (among others).\nThe government has repeatedly claimed that Individual #1 was “potentially an agent of a\nforeign government[,]” see, e.g., Gov’t Br. at 20, 21, 30, 81, 86, 87, and it appears from the Order\nsaid.\n42  See, e.g., Matt Zapotosky, “Ex-FBI lawyer avoids prison after admitting he doctored\nemail in investigation of Trump’s 2016 campaign,” The Washington Post, January 29, 2021,\navailable at https://wapo.st/3ek0C0a.\n67\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 81 of 143 PageID #:\n2235\nissued by the District Court after Mr. Hasbajrami’s appeal was underway, that the government relied\nupon that quite possibly inaccurate or even false claim to support its Title I and Title III FISA\napplications, which had themselves been derived from the Government’s Section 702 surveillance. \nSee Order, dated, February 25, 2016 (released to the defense in redacted, unclassified, partially\nmodified form, on March 8, 2016) (ECF #165), at 23-25.\nMoreover, based upon the District Court’s Order, it is apparent that the government also\nrelied upon that potentially false claim in classified ex parte submissions presented to the District \nCourt below.   Indeed, the failure to confront contrary information has persisted through the appellate\nprocess, as the Government’s Brief (cited above) demonstrates.  Thus, the very distinct probability\nexists that one of the very same serious abuses that occurred during the Crossfire Hurricane\ninvestigation – concealing information that contradicted the government’s theory of investigation\n– plagued the FISA process in this case as well.43\nAn article in The New York Times published soon after the December 2019 DoJ OIG Report\nwas released reported that “according to interviews with more than two dozen current and former\nF.B.I. agents and Justice Department officials who have worked with national security wiretaps[,]”\n43  In response to the December 2019 DoJ OIG Report’s disclosures, the FISC, in a March\n5, 2020, Corrected Opinion & Order, available at https://bit.ly/3ehTjpz, required all future FISA\napplications to include from a DoJ attorney the certification that “this application fairly reflects\nall information that might reasonably call into question the accuracy of the information or the\nreasonableness of any FBI assessment in the application, or otherwise raise doubts about the\nrequested findings.”  Id., at 19.  Also, FBI agents would have to certify that they “apprised\n[NSD’S OI]” of all such information.  Id.

The DoJ IG’s March 2020 Management Advisory Memorandum \non FBI’s Widespread Non-Compliance with Its “Woods Procedures”\nThe alarm generated by the fruits of the investigation that produced the December 2019 DoJ\nIG Report motivated the DoJ IG to conduct a further audit of a select number of FISA applications. \nThat produced, in March 2020, a MANAGEMENT ADVISORY MEMORANDUM FOR THE DIRECTOR OF\nTHE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION REGARDING THE EXECUTION OF WOODS PROCEDURES FOR\nAPPLICATIONS FILED WITH THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE COURT RELATING TO U.S.\nPERSONS, DoJ IG, March 30, 2020 (“March 2020 DoJ IG Management Advisory Memorandum”),\navailable at https://bit.ly/3mtppmU.\nThat March 2020 DoJ IG Management Advisory Memorandum’s “initial review of [the\nFISA] applications [] consisted solely of determining whether the contents of the FBI’s Woods File\nsupported statements of fact in the associated FISA application.”  Id., at 2.45  As the Management\n44  That article added that those same officials said that while “[t]he system is vulnerable \n. . . to lower-level agents suppressing or overlooking evidence that weakens their case when they\nseek permission to conduct surveillance,” nevertheless “similar flaws with surveillance have\nsurfaced before, underscoring that the problems may be systemic rather than unique to the Page\napplications, current and former officials said.”  Id. \n45  The “review did not seek to determine whether support existed elsewhere for the\nfactual assertion in the FISA application (such as in the case file), or if relevant information had\n69\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 83 of 143 PageID #:\n2237\nAdvisory Memorandum explains, “The stated purposes of the Woods Procedures are to minimize\nfactual inaccuracies in FISA applications and to ensure that statements contained in applications are\n‘scrupulously accurate.’” Id., at 3.46  \nIn  addition,  “[s]pecifically,  the  Woods  Procedures  mandate  compiling  supporting\ndocumentation for each fact in the FISA application.”47  A Woods File is supposed to contain “(1) \nsupporting documentation for every factual assertion contained in a FISA application, and (2) \nsupporting documentation and the results of required database searches and other verifications.”  Id. \nYet the DoJ IG concluded, “As a result of our audit work to date and as described below, we\ndo not have confidence that the FBI has executed its Woods Procedures in compliance with FBI\npolicy.”  Id.

The FISC’s\nconcerns were those raised in the matter discussed above, yet 20 years later FBI’s failure to abide\nby the rules of FISA or the Fourth Amendment have persisted and, as amply demonstrated in the\nFISC’s subsequent opinions, spread unabated to Section 702 querying.

Moreover, “[a]lthough reports related to 3 of the 42 FISA applications did not identify\nany deficiencies, the reports covering the remaining 39 applications identified a total of about\n390 issues, including unverified, inaccurate, or inadequately supported facts, as well as\ntypographical errors.”  Id., at 5.

In other instances, we were told by the case agents\nwho prepared the renewal applications that they only verified\nnewly added statements of fact in renewal applications because\nthey had already verified the original statements of fact when\nsubmitting the initial application.

The DoJ IG’s Subsequent September 2021 Audit Report on \nIts Further Investigation of “Woods Procedures” Non-Compliance\nIn September 2021 the DoJ OIG augmented its earlier March 2020 review of FBI’s Woods\nProcedures non-compliance.  See OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,\nNo. 21-129, AUDIT OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION’S EXECUTION OF ITS WOODS\nPROCEDURES FOR APPLICATIONS FILED WITH THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE COURT\nRELATING TO U.S. PERSONS 21-129 (September 2021) (“September 2021 DoJ OIG Audit”), available\nat https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/21-129.pdf.\nThe September 2021 DoJ OIG Audit reviewed FISA applications “approved by the [FISC]\nbetween fiscal years 2015 and 2019.”  Id., at i.  Subsequent to issuing the March 2020 DoJ IG\nManagement Advisory Memo, “the FBI conducted an accuracy review of those 29 FISA applications\n[that were the subject of the March 2020 DoJ IG Management Advisory Memo];  thereafter, [DoJ]\nnotified the FISC of 209 instances where the applications were inaccurate, unsupported, or omitted\ninformation.”  Id., at 7.\nThe “additional OIG audit work determined there were another 209 instances where the\nWoods Files did not contain adequate documentation to support factual assertions in the sampled\napplications but where the FBI and NSD told [DoJ OIG] they had determined that appropriate\nsupport was subsequently located in other holdings.”  Id.\nAs a result, “in total, there were over 400 instances of non-compliance with the Woods\nProcedures in connection with those 29 FISA applications.”  Id.  Broadening its scope, DoJ OIG’s\n73\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 87 of 143 PageID #:\n2241\n“review of FBI documentation determined that, out of the universe of over 7,000 FISA applications\nauthorized between January 2015 and March 2020, there were at least 179 instances in which the\nWoods File required by FBI policy was missing in whole or in part, which are in addition to the 4\nreferenced in our March 2020 MAM.”  Id.\nThus, “[a]pproximately 20 years after implementing the Woods Procedures to address the\nFISC’s concerns regarding the accuracy of FBI FISA applications, [DoJ OIG’s] review of 29\nsampled FISA applications found that the FBI was not meeting the expectations of its own\nprotocols.”  Id.  See also post, at 79-80.\nIndeed, the September 2021 DoJ OIG Audit concluded that “[g]iven the FBI’s reliance upon\nits Woods Procedures to help ensure the accuracy of its FISA applications, we believe the missing\nWoods Files represent a significant lapse in the FBI’s management of its FISA program.”  Id., at ii. \nIn addition, notwithstanding intervening measures adopted by FBI and DoJ to correct the\nproblems, the DoJ OIG stated it “believe[s] additional action is necessary to ensure rigorous\nsupervisory review and to further strengthen Woods Procedures oversight to reduce the risk of\nerroneous information being included in FISA applications, which can lead to faulty probable cause\ndeterminations and infringement of U.S. persons’ civil liberties.”  Id., at i.\nD.

As if Judge Bates’s 2011 FISC Op. and Judge Walton’s 2009 FISC Op. (and the\nnumerous others cited above) were insufficient to demonstrate NSA’s abject inability – whether\n78\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 92 of 143 PageID #:\n2246\ndeliberate or simply through inexcusably irresponsible negligence or cavalier incompetence – to\ncomply, a subsequent August 13, 2009, report the government submitted to the FISC revealed even\nmore non-compliance issues beyond the myriad enumerated in Judge Walton’s opinion, and which\nwere discovered after issuance of that Opinion.

Id.\nThe government’s continued non-compliance and recidivism, establishes that the FISC’s\ncomplaints, and even its attempts at remedial measures, are ineffectual as long as the process remains\nsecret and ex parte from start to finish.  The public record – and who knows (certainly not defense\ncounsel) what still remains classified – compels but one conclusion:  the government agencies\nresponsible for administering FISA cannot be trusted, despite repeated chances, and one of the\nprincipal reasons is the absence of any accountability. \nThe repeated misrepresentations cited by Judge Bates in October 2011 and Judge Walton in\n2009 constitute simply a constant and continued feature of government practice with respect to FISA\nsurveillance generally.  Indeed, they are reminiscent of those divulged in the FISC’s 2002 opinion\nin In re All Matters Submitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, 218 F.

Nor were those problems isolated or resolved\nby those revelations.  Instead, they proved persistent.  A report issued March 8, 2006, by the DoJ\nInspector General stated that the FBI found apparent violations of its own wiretapping and other\nintelligence-gathering procedures more than 100 times in the preceding two years, and problems\nappeared to have grown more frequent in some crucial respects.

The total percentage of FISA-related violations rose from 71% to 78%\nfrom 2004 to 2005, id., at 29, although the amount of time “over-collection” and “overruns” were\npermitted to continue before the violations were recognized or corrected decreased from 2004 to\n2005.  Id., at 25. \nThe lack of veracity catalogued in the several declassified FISC opinions discussed ante is\ninevitable in a system in which there is no opponent to dispute facts or hold opponents accountable\nfor misrepresenting facts, and in which the court lacks investigative authority or any practical,\nmeaningful means of oversight over the collection/storage/interception process.  Indeed, an internal\nMay 2012 audit of NSA’s surveillance programs – among the documents disclosed in 2013 by\nEdward Snowden – found that NSA violated privacy rules protecting domestic U.S. communications\n2,776 times in a one-year period.

Rather, the\npublication of documents released to Electronic Privacy Information Center in Freedom of\nInformation Act litigation prompted the DoJ IG to use those and other documents as a basis for\nthe report.  In preparing the report the IG reviewed only those 108 instances in which the FBI\nitself reported violations to the Intelligence Oversight Board – a four-member Executive Branch\nbody that ordinarily does not submit its reports to Congress.\n81\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 95 of 143 PageID #:\n2249\nUnfortunately, in a system in which the government and its law enforcement and intelligence\norgans are free to misrepresent without challenge or accountability, little has changed except perhaps\nthe government’s enhanced dexterity in abusing and manipulating the FISC and the FISA system as\na whole.\nE.  Pursuant to Specific Sections of FISA, and Consistent With CIPA, \nthe Information Should Be Provided to Security-Cleared Defense Counsel \nUnless the Court decides as a matter of law that the government’s queries of Section 702\ndatabases violated Mr. Hasbajrami’s Fourth Amendment rights, and that suppression is required, it\nis respectfully submitted that participation of security-cleared defense counsel is necessary for FISA\nand the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process protection to be satisfied.  \nThat includes access to both the government’s factual submissions and legal briefing, and\nis  authorized,  even  constitutionally  compelled,  by  provisions  of  FISA  and  CIPA,  and  the\nconstitutional rights they enforce through their provisions.  For example, as detailed below, \nFISA includes two sections that authorize disclosure “under appropriate security procedures and\nprotective orders” – either because “such disclosure is necessary to make an accurate determination\nof the legality of the surveillance[,]” 50 U.S.C. §1806(f), or “to the extent that due process requires\ndiscovery or disclosure.”  50 U.S.C §1806(g).  \nAlso, as discussed below, CIPA, which regulates the use of classified information in criminal\ncases, was expressly designed to afford defendants the same access to helpful classified materials\nas they would possess if the information were not classified, and even provides courts with discretion\nto dismiss an indictment if the government refuses to comply with court-ordered disclosure to\nsecurity-cleared defense counsel.  See CIPA, 18 U.S.C.

Nor\nis every fact about the government’s reliance on backdoor searches properly classified.  See, e.g.,\nPCLOB Report 59, 129.\nThe entirely one-sided nature of FISA litigation, particularly in the context of determining\nwhether the government adhered to the restrictions set forth in 50 U.S.C. §1881a, applies not only\nto the facts at issue, as only the government knows the facts specific to the FAA electronic\nsurveillance and interception with respect to Mr. Hasbajrami, but also to the law as well, as the\ngovernment has access to the entire body of FISC and FISCR opinions, while defense counsel’s\naccess is limited to those few opinions the government or the court has released publicly.\nThis decidedly unlevel playing field – indeed, it is vertical, with the government at the apex\nand defense counsel at the bottom – has clear implications, not the least of which is the government’s\nundefeated (and unsurprising, in light of the advantages inherent in ex parte litigation) record in\nFISA litigation in the statute’s 43-year history.  Also, it imposes upon the Court a responsibility –\nreview of the FISA or FAA submissions as, in effect, surrogate defense counsel – to which courts\nhave acknowledged they are not sufficiently suited to fulfill.\nAs the dissent in Muhtorov recognized, “[o]ur Fourth Amendment analysis must begin with\nan acknowledgement that CIPA procedures fundamentally alter the structures of our adversarial\n84\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 98 of 143 PageID #:\n2252\nprocess and place courts in a position as uncomfortable as it is unique.”  Muhtorov, 2021 WL\n5817486, at *85 (Lucero, J., dissenting).  \nIn the CIPA context, \nCongress has mandated that we step out of our traditional role as\nneutral arbiters overseeing adversarial presentation of issues and step\ninto a role much closer to that of an inquisitor.  As explicitly\nacknowledged by the government, a district court's role in cases\ninvolving CIPA is to act as “standby counsel for the defendants.”\nSimilarly, on appeal “we must place ourselves in the shoes of defense\ncounsel, the very ones that cannot see the classified record, and act\nwith a view to their interests.” \nId., citing United States v. Amawi, 695 F.3d 457, 471 (6th Cir. 2012). \nNevertheless, as the dissent in Muhtorov conceded, “[t]he judiciary is neither institutionally\nsuited nor resourced to fulfill this role.”  Id. (footnote omitted).  In Muhtorov, the majority concluded\nthe District Court had not abused its discretion in denying certain disclosure requests by the defense,\nnoting that “[d]isclosure of classified FISA materials is the exception, not the rule.”  Muhtorov, 2021\nWL 5817486, at *41.  \nYet if ever there was an exception meriting disclosure, this case is it.  This case is unique. \nIt represents the first time in the 43-year history of FISA a District Court’s ruling validating FISA-\nbased interception was not affirmed in full, and the first remand for a factual determination.  Also,\nit does so, as set forth ante, at 8, 23-27,  because the government initially concealed from Mr.\nHasbajrami and the District Court the Section 702 surveillance itself, and because, on appeal, the\ngovernment essentially refused to provide information about querying to the Second Circuit. \nConsequently, security-cleared defense counsel’s access to the government’s factual and legal\n85\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 99 of 143 PageID #:\n2253\nsubmissions is an essential element of any determination that would be consistent with sufficient\naccuracy and Due Process.\n1.  Two Sections of FISA Authorize Disclosure to Defense Counsel\nWhile aggrieved criminal defendants can move to suppress FISA-generated evidence, 50\nU.S.C. §1806(f) provides that if the Attorney General files an affidavit that “disclosure or an\nadversary hearing would harm the national security of the United States,” the court deciding the\nmotion must consider the application and order for electronic surveillance in camera to determine\nwhether the surveillance was conducted lawfully.54\nNevertheless, FISA contains two provisions that authorize disclosure to security-cleared\ndefense counsel.\na.  Disclosure of FISA Materials to the \nDefense Pursuant to 50 U.S.C. §1806(f)\nAt 50 U.S.C. §1806(f), FISA provides this Court with discretion to determine whether to\n“disclose to the aggrieved person, under appropriate security procedures and protective orders,\nportions of the application, order, or other materials relating to the surveillance” to the extent “such\ndisclosure is necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance.” \n(Emphasis added).55\n54  Although the defense has not been notified whether the Attorney General has yet\nsubmitted an affidavit under 50 U.S.C. §1806(f) for purposes of this remand, it is assumed for\npurposes of this motion that the government has or will make such a filing.  \n55  In Muhtorov, the Tenth Circuit noted that 50 U.S.C. §1806(f) “applies to Section 702\nas well as traditional FISA.”  2021 WL 5817486, at *37 n.39, citing 50 U.S.C. §1881e(a)(1)\n(“[i]nformation acquired from an acquisition conducted under [Section 702] shall be deemed to\nbe information acquired from an electronic surveillance pursuant to [Title] I for purposes of\nsection 1806 of this title, except [in circumstances not relevant here]”).  That also encompasses\n50 U.S.C. §1806(g).\n86\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 100 of 143 PageID #:\n2254\nAccording to FISA’s legislative history, disclosure may be “necessary” under 50 U.S.C.\n§1806(f) “where the court’s initial review of the application, order, and fruits of the surveillance\nindicates that the question of legality may be complicated by factors such as ‘indications of possible\nmisrepresentation of fact, vague identification of the persons to be surveilled, or surveillance records\nwhich include a significant amount of nonforeign intelligence information, calling into question\ncompliance with the minimization standards contained in the order.’”  United States v. Belfield, 692\nF.2d 141, 147 (D.C. Cir. 1982), (quoting S. Rep. No. 701, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 64 (1979));  see, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Ott, 827 F.2d 473, 476 (9th Cir. 1987) (same);  United States v. Duggan, 743 F.2d\n59, 78 (2d Cir. 1984) (same).\nHere, as discussed ante, at 6, 23-27, and 67-68, there are ample justifications for disclosure,\nas the government’s repeated lack of candor, misrepresentations, and inaccuracies in one-sided FISA\nproceedings – both generally and in this case – underscore the necessity of adhering to the adversary\nprocess here.  Cf. Muhtorov, 2021 WL 5817486, at *41 (District Court did not abuse its discretion\nin denying disclosure because the defendant’s “misrepresentation theory is speculative” and “based\nsolely on the government's behavior in other cases”).\nCounsel for Mr. Hasbajrami all possess security clearance to at least Top Secret level (and\nall have been read into more secret programs requiring SCI clearance).  In addition, the Court can \nissue an appropriate Protective Order, to which Mr. Hasbajrami’s counsel would of course consent,\nthat would provide elaborate protection for classified information, and which would permit classified\nmaterials to be disclosed to defense counsel but not to the defendant.  See CIPA, 18 U.S.C. App. 3,\nat §3.\n87\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 101 of 143 PageID #:\n2255\nThus, the circumstances herein compel disclosure of  FISA applications, orders, and/or\nmaterials related to  backdoor searches.  Indeed, the existence of 50 U.S.C.  §1806(f) is  an\nunambiguous declaration that Congress intended for courts to grant disclosure in appropriate cases. \nIf 50 U.S.C. §1806(f) is to be rendered meaningful at all, and not be rendered superfluous and\nentirely inert, it should apply in this unprecedented case.  See United States v. Daoud, 755 F. 3d 479,\n485-86 (7th Cir. 2014) (Rovner, J., concurring) (complete absence of disclosure is in conflict with\ndefendants’ constitutional rights).\nb.  Disclosure of FISA Materials to the \nDefense Pursuant to 50 U.S.C. §1806(g)\nEven if the Court were to decline to find that disclosure of FISA-related materials to the\ndefense is appropriate under 50 U.S.C. §1806(f), the defense would still be entitled to disclosure of\nthe FISA applications, orders, and related materials under 50 U.S.C. §1806(g), which expressly\nincorporates  the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, and provides that “[i]f the court determines\nthat the surveillance was lawfully authorized and conducted, it shall deny the motion of the\naggrieved person except to the extent that due process requires discovery or disclosure.”  50 U.S.C.\n§1806(g) (emphasis added).  See also United States v. Spanjol, 720 F. Supp. 55, 57 (E.D. Pa. 1989)\n(“[u]nder FISA, defendants are permitted discovery of materials only to the extent required by due\nprocess.  That has been interpreted as requiring production of materials mandated by [Brady],\nessentially exculpatory materials”).\nAs a threshold Due Process principle, ex parte proceedings are exceedingly disfavored.  As\nthe Sixth Circuit has cautioned, “[d]emocracies die behind closed doors.”  Detroit Free Press v.\nAshcroft, 303 F.3d 681, 683 (6th Cir. 2002).  As the Ninth Circuit has observed, “ex parte\n88\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 102 of 143 PageID #:\n2256\nproceedings are anathema in our system of justice.”  Guenther v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,\n889 F.2d 882, 884 (9th Cir. 1989), appeal after remand, 939 F.2d 758 (9th Cir. 1991).\nAs the Supreme Court recognized in Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, 184 (1969)\n– a case involving electronic surveillance – “In our adversary system, it is enough for judges to\njudge.  The determination of what may be useful to the defense can properly and effectively be made\nonly by an advocate.”  See also Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 169 (1978) (permitting\nadversarial proceeding on showing of intentional falsehood in warrant affidavit because the\nmagistrate who approves a warrant ex parte “has no acquaintance with the information that may\ncontradict the good faith and reasonable basis of the affiant’s allegations”); Dennis v. United States,\n384 U.S. 855, 875 (1966).56\nEx parte proceedings impair the integrity of the adversary process and the criminal justice\nsystem.  In United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 230-31 (1975), the Court declared that “[w]e have\nelected to employ an adversary system of criminal justice in which the parties contest all issues\nbefore a court of law[,]” and that “[t]he need to develop all relevant facts in the adversary system\nis both fundamental and comprehensive.”  (Emphasis added) (quotation omitted).  \n56  As the District Court in United States v. Marzook, 412 F. Supp.2d 913 (N.D. Ill. 2006),\nalso a case involving terrorism-related charges, explained in the context of deciding whether to\nclose a suppression hearing to the public because of the potential revelation of classified\ninformation thereat,  \nIt is a matter of conjecture whether the court performs any real\njudicial function when it reviews classified documents in camera. \nWithout the illumination provided by adversarial challenge and\nwith no expertness in the field of national security, the court has no\nbasis on which to test the accuracy of the government's claims.\nId., at 921, (quoting Stein v. Department of Justice & Federal Bureau of Investigation, 662 F.2d\n1245, 1259 (7th Cir. 1981)).\n89\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 103 of 143 PageID #:\n2257\nAs the Supreme Court has recognized, “‘Fairness can rarely be obtained by secret, one-sided\ndetermination of facts decisive of rights. . . .  No better instrument has been devised for arriving at\ntruth than to give a person in jeopardy of serious loss notice of the case against him and opportunity\nto meet it.’”  United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, et. al., 510 U.S. 43, at 55 (1993),\n(quoting  Joint  Anti-Fascist  Refugee  Committee  v.  McGrath,  341  U.S.  123,  170-72  (1951)\n(Frankfurter, J., concurring)).  See also United States v. Madori, 419  F.3d 159, 171 (2d Cir. 2005),\nciting United States v. Arroyo-Angulo, 580 F.2d 1137, 1145 (2d Cir. 1978) (closed proceedings “are\nfraught with the potential of abuse and, absent compelling necessity, must be avoided”) (other\ncitations omitted).57\nThe dissent in Muhtorov quoted the Supreme Court’s opinion in United States v. Cronic, 466\nU.S. 648, 655 (1984), for the principle that “[t]he very premise of our adversary system of criminal\njustice is that partisan advocacy on both sides of a case will best promote the ultimate objective that\nthe guilty be convicted and the innocent go free.  It is that very premise that underlies and gives\nmeaning to the Sixth Amendment. It is meant to assure fairness in the adversary criminal process.” \nMuhtorov, 2021 WL 5817486, at *80 n.13 (Lucero, J., dissenting) (“cleaned up”).  See also id.,\n(quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 685 (1984) (“a fair trial is one in which evidence\nsubject to adversarial testing is presented to an impartial tribunal for resolution of issues defined in\nadvance of the proceeding”)).58\n57  Conversely, as Judge Learned Hand stated in United States v. Coplon, 185 F.2d 629,\n638 (2d Cir. 1950), “Few weapons in the arsenal of freedom are more useful than the power to\ncompel a government to disclose the evidence on which is seeks to forfeit the liberty of its\ncitizens.”\n58  The dissent in Muhtorov added that\n90\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 104 of 143 PageID #:\n2258\nIn United States v. Abuhamra, 389 F.3d 309 (2d Cir. 2004), the Second Circuit reemphasized\nthe importance of open, adversary proceedings, declaring that “[p]articularly where liberty is at stake,\ndue process demands that the individual and the government each be afforded the opportunity not\nonly to advance their respective positions but to correct or contradict arguments or evidence offered\nby the other.”  Abuhamra, 389 F.3d at 322-23, citing McGrath, 341 U.S. at 171 n. 17 (Frankfurter,\nJ., concurring) (noting that “the duty lying upon every one who decides anything to act in good faith\nand fairly listen to both sides . . . always giving a fair opportunity to those who are parties in the\ncontroversy for correcting or contradicting any relevant statement prejudicial to their view”) (citation\nand internal quotation marks omitted).\nSimilarly,  in  the  Fourth  Amendment  context,  including  in  relationship  to  electronic\nsurveillance, the Supreme Court has twice rejected the use of ex parte proceedings on grounds that\napply equally here.  In Alderman, the Court addressed the procedures to be followed in determining\nwhether government eavesdropping in violation of the Fourth Amendment contributed to the\nprosecution case against the defendants.  \nThe  Court  rejected  the  government's  suggestion  that  the  District  Court  make  that\ndetermination in camera and/or ex parte, and observed that\nAny other approach would make a mockery of our criminal justice\nsystem.  We cannot require a defendant to specifically challenge\nthe use of certain evidence when he does not have access to that\nvery evidence to investigate its origins fully or to test its\nadmissibility.  To conclude that a defendant may mount a\nderivative evidence challenge to the use of § 702-derived evidence\nonly if he has access to the evidence – which he does not – would\ntransform the Fourth Amendment inquiry into a dark comedy.\nMuhtorov, 2021 WL 5817486, at *85 n.22 (Lucero, J., dissenting). \n91\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 105 of 143 PageID #:\n2259\nAn apparently innocent phrase, a chance remark, a reference to what\nappears to be a neutral person or event, the identity of a caller or the\nindividual on the other end of a telephone, or even the manner of\nspeaking or using words may have special significance to one who\nknows the more intimate facts of an accused's life.  And yet that\ninformation may be wholly colorless and devoid of meaning to one\nless well acquainted with all relevant circumstances.\nAlderman, 389 U.S. at 182.  \nIn ordering disclosure of improperly recorded conversations, the Court declared:\n[a]dversary proceedings will not magically eliminate all error, but\nthey will substantially reduce its incidence by guarding against the\npossibility that the trial judge, through lack of time or unfamiliarity\nwith the information contained in and suggested by the materials, will\nbe  unable  to  provide  the  scrutiny  that  the  Fourth  Amendment\nexclusionary rule demands.\nId. at 184.59\nLikewise, the Court held in Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), that a defendant, upon\na preliminary showing of an intentional or reckless material falsehood in an affidavit underlying a\nsearch warrant, must be permitted to attack the veracity of that affidavit.  The Court rested its\ndecision in significant part on the inherent inadequacies of the ex parte nature of the procedure for\nissuing a search warrant, and the contrasting enhanced value of adversarial proceedings:\n[T]he hearing before the magistrate [when the warrant is issued] not\nalways will suffice to discourage lawless or reckless misconduct.  The\npre-search proceeding is necessarily ex parte, since the subject of the\n59  In Muhtorov, the Tenth Circuit distinguished Alderman in a manner that makes\nAlderman all the more applicable here.  In Muhtorov, the Court stated that in Alderman the\n“question was whether disclosure was necessary so the parties could litigate the scope of the\nexclusionary rule.”  2021 WL 5817486, at *48.  Here, that is precisely what the Circuit has\nincluded in the remand, as determining whether any exception to the exclusionary rule – such as\n“good faith,” or the independent source doctrine, or even harmlessness – applies herein has been\ndelegated to the Court.  945 F.3d at 673-77.  Indeed, even the government has pressed those\nexceptions.  Id.\n92\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 106 of 143 PageID #:\n2260\nsearch cannot be tipped off to the application for a warrant lest he\ndestroy or remove evidence.  The usual reliance of our legal system\non adversary proceedings itself should be an indication that an ex\nparte inquiry is likely to be less vigorous.  The magistrate has no\nacquaintance with the information that may contradict the good faith\nand reasonable basis of the affiant's allegations.  The pre-search\nproceeding will  frequently be marked by haste, because of the\nunderstandable desire to act before the evidence disappears; this\nurgency will not always permit the magistrate to make an independent\nexamination of the affiant or other witnesses.\nFranks, 438 U.S. at 169.\nThe same considerations that the Supreme Court found compelling in Alderman and Franks\ncompel rejection of ex parte procedures in the peculiar context of this case.  After all, denying an\nadversary access to the facts constitutes an advantage as powerful and insurmountable as exists in\nlitigation.\nEx parte proceedings thus present an overwhelming danger of erroneous decisions.  The\nCourt, which has not had opportunity to review the discovery, or consult with the defense, cannot\nbe expected to surmise the factual and legal nuances, or implications, of the redacted portions. \nConsequently, the  Court cannot, despite its best efforts, properly function as Mr. Hasbajrami’s\nsurrogate advocate, particularly with respect to the critical factual and legal issues in this case, which\nare  considerably  more  complicated  than  an  ordinary  case  both  factually  and  legally,  thus\nirremediably impairing further a court’s ability to play the role of defense counsel in a manner the\nFifth and Sixth Amendments require.\nAs the Ninth Circuit observed in the closely analogous context of a secret evidence case,\n“‘[o]ne would be hard pressed to design a procedure more likely to result in erroneous deprivations.’\n. . .  [T]he very foundation of the adversary process assumes that use of undisclosed information will\n93\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 107 of 143 PageID #:\n2261\nviolate due process because of the risk of error.”  American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee\nv. Reno, 70 F.3d 1045, 1069 (9th Cir. 1995), (quoting District Court); see, e.g., id. at 1070 (noting\n“enormous risk of error” in use of secret evidence); Kiareldeen v. Reno, 71 F. Supp. 2d 402, 412-14\n(D.N.J. 1999) (same).\nMoreover, while defense counsel have always been aware that they were operating at an \ninsuperable disadvantage by being denied access to the FISA applications or the underlying\nsupporting documents (unlike any other situation in which the government seizes evidence pursuant\nto warrant), only since 2013 has it been revealed, through selective and often considerably delayed\ndeclassification of FISC opinions, that there has existed for more than a decade a growing body of\nlaw, in the form of opinions by the FISC and FISCR, that have been available to government\ncounsel, but not to even security-cleared defense counsel.  See also ante, at 84-85 & n. 15.\nThat represents an additional inequity impairing defense counsel’s ability to present Mr.\nHasbajrami’s position effectively, which would only be aggravated by maintaining ex parte\nredactions in the opinions by both the District Court and the Second Circuit, and any in the upcoming\nsubmissions by the government.  Unless defense counsel are permitted to review the redacted\nportions, only the defense, the party possessing constitutional rights, and whose counsel hold the\nappropriate security clearance(s), will be denied the ability to confront those Opinions as it exists in\ntheir entirety.  Cf. United States v. Hsu, 155 F.3d 189, 204-05 (3d Cir. 1998) (neither the Court nor\nthe parties had seen the redacted information, which was arguably related to a defense the Court\nruled was not legally viable).\nIn addition, Due Process does not permit the government to withhold relevant or helpful\ninformation on the basis of privilege – and certainly not on the basis of an unsupported claim of\n94\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 108 of 143 PageID #:\n2262\nprivilege.  See Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 60-61 (1957);  United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d\n72, 79-80 (2d Cir. 2008) (“information can be helpful [within the meaning of Roviaro] without being\n‘favorable’ in the [Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)] sense”).\nThe government’s initial misrepresentation to Mr. Hasbajrami, which led to the vacatur of\nhis original guilty plea, constituted a Due Process violation that likewise supports disclosure as a\nremedial measure now.  See, e.g., United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 431-32 (1973) (there could\nexist “a situation in which the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageous that due process\nprinciples would absolutely bar the government from invoking judicial processes to obtain a\nconviction”),  citing [cf.] Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165 (1952).  See also United States v.\nSchmidt, 105 F.3d 82, 91 (2d Cir. 1997), citing Russell, 411 U.S. at 431-432.\nAs a result, the requisite “analysis of the governmental and private interests that are\naffected[,]” Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334 (1976), including “three distinct factors,” id.,\nat 335, weigh heavily in Mr. Hasbajrami’s favor:\n(1)  regarding the private interest that will be affected by the official action, Mr.\nHasbajrami, as the Circuit and the FISC have recognized in plain language, has a\nsubstantial interest in accurately determining whether the government’s surveillance\nviolated his rights;\n(2)  the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through ex parte procedures is\nsignificant, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural\nsafeguards is substantial, particularly in the context of complex factual and legal\nissues;  and\n95\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 109 of 143 PageID #:\n2263\n(3)  the government’s interest can be sufficiently protected because, as contemplated\nunder CIPA (as noted in the Circuit’s opinion, Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 677 n. 24),\nthis Court could order disclosure under a protective order that limits access to\nsecurity-cleared counsel.  See also Tweak or Overhaul (“even giving due weight to\n[the government’s] considerations, a categorical rule of permanent secrecy in every\nFISA case seems impossible to justify”).\n2.  CIPA Provides a Mechanism for Disclosure to Security-Cleared \nDefense Counsel Consistent With Due Process and National Security\nThe classified nature of the redacted material does not foreclose access by security-cleared\ndefense counsel.  The Second Circuit clearly envisioned that disclosure can be arranged “consistent\nwith the requirements of CIPA and FISA.”  Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 677 n.24.  See also United\nStates v. Moussaoui, 365 F.3d 292, 308 n.12 (4th Cir.), opinion amended on reh’g, 382 F.3d 453 (4th\nCir. 2004) (applying principles and provisions of CIPA to circumstances involving classified\ninformation and materials even though the statute did not technically cover the specific situation); \nUnited States v. Moussaoui, 333 F.3d 509, 513-15 (4th Cir. 2003).\n CIPA was designed to regulate the use of classified material in federal criminal prosecutions,\nand to create a system through which defense counsel would gain access to classified information\nand materials pertinent to the case.\nThe express purpose of CIPA is to protect sensitive national security information, but not at\nthe expense of a defendant’s rights.  See United States v. Stewart, 590 F.3d 93, 130 (2d Cir. 2009);\nUnited States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 80 (2d Cir. 2008) (government’s privilege under CIPA “must give\n96\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 110 of 143 PageID #:\n2264\nway” when classified information is helpful or material to the defense).  See also United States v.\nDumeisi, 424 F.3d 566, 578 (7th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted).  \nIn fact, in enacting CIPA, Congress warned that “the defendant should not stand in a worse\nposition, because of the fact that classified information is involved, than he would without the Act.” \nS. Rep. No. 96-823, at 9 (1980).  See also, e.g., United States v. Poindexter, 698 F.

That includes the disclosure of surveillance\nmaterials sufficient for a defendant to fairly litigate suppression issues.  Yet without defense\ncounsel’s participation in the process of evaluating the factual and legal materials the government\nwill provide, how can the defendant be said to have been placed in the same position as he would\nif he enjoyed access to those materials?\nFurther justifying disclosure of FISA and FAA materials to security-cleared defense counsel\nin this case, the government’s non-compliance clearly rises to level described in United States v.\nDuggan, 743 F.2d 59, 79 (2d Cir. 1984), in which the Second Circuit, relying on FISA’s legislative\nhistory, explained that the need for disclosure \nmight  arise  if  the  judge’s  initial  review  revealed  potential\nirregularities such as possible  misrepresentations of fact, vague\nidentification of the persons to be surveilled, or surveillance records\nwhich include[ ] a significant amount of nonforeign intelligence\ninformation, calling into question compliance with the minimization\nstandards contained in the order[.]\n97\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 111 of 143 PageID #:\n2265\nDuggan, 743 F.2d at 79.

See, e.g., ante, at 62-74.60\nMoreover, the legal and factual questions related to the lawfulness of the querying and the\nfruit of the poisonous tree analysis are technical, novel, and complex, and therefore disclosure to\nsecurity-cleared defense counsel is “necessary” in this case, precisely as Congress intended when it\nincluded 50 U.S.C. §1806(f) within FISA.  Also, if the Court conducts an evidentiary hearing,\ncross-examination regarding the government’s queries related to Mr. Hasbajrami would be a nullity\nabsent security-cleared defense counsel’s access to the underlying factual materials.\nIn 2020, in the aftermath of the December 2019 DoJ IG Report, see ante, at 62-69, Robert\nS.

[FISA] minimization procedures . . . to abrogate the rights\nafforded to defendants in criminal proceedings” and submits without explanation “that the same\nreasoning would apply in civil proceedings.”  Id., at 8 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).\nThe FISC determined that “[i]nterpreting FISA’s criminal prohibitions to hinder pursuit of\nits complementary civil remedies would violate the principle that “[s]tatutes should be interpreted\nas a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme.”  Id., at 13, citing Mellouli v.

In addition, in response to pressure from the Supreme Court during oral\nargument in United States v.

The Government’s Self-Investigation and the FISC’s Oversight Have Proven \nInadequate and Unable to Stem the Tide of FISA and Section 702 Abuses\nThe historical and intractable inability of the U.S. law enforcement and intelligence\ncommunity to comply with FISA and, in that context, the Fourth Amendment – entailed in the\nvarious IG and other reports and FISC opinions discussed ante, throughout this memo of law –\nillustrates the impossibility of not only a wholly ex parte system operating by the rules, but also of\nthat system policing and reforming itself.  \nAs discussed ante and post, time and again the same non-compliance has been repeated\nwithout accountability or effective change.  Allowing the agencies involved to cherry-pick which\nFISA applications and cases are reviewed for compliance, and the culture of minimizing non-\ncompliance and the importance of protecting civil liberties simply has not been effective in\nimproving the FISA process and eliminating abuses.\nAlso, as set forth below, the mechanisms designed for oversight purposes have not fulfilled\ntheir role(s) effectively.

For example, the audit expressed its “concerns with the FBI’s\nand NSD’s oversight efforts – specifically the need to be strategic, accountable, and timely.”  Id., at\nii.  The audit pointed out that “FBI and NSD conduct periodic reviews designed to ensure FISA\napplications contain accurate information[,]” but, as reflected in the March 2020 DoJ OIG\nManagement Advisory Memo (see ante, at 69-73), “neither the FBI nor NSD used these tools to their\nfull potential.”  Id.  As a result, the September 2021 DoJ OIG Audit concluded that “FBI’s\ndecentralized oversight is a missed opportunity for ensuring accountability and efficacy of the\nWoods Procedures as a whole.”  Id.\nRegarding the Woods Files reviewed, the September 2021 DoJ OIG Audit “observed that the\nWoods Files generally did not contain evidence of the thoroughness or completeness of this\nsupervisory review.”  Id.  As aresult, “[t]he widespread Woods Procedures non-compliance that we\nidentified in this audit raises serious questions about the adequacy and execution of the SSA review\nprocess in place at the time of the applications we reviewed.”  Id.66\nThe March 2020 Management Advisory Memorandum portrayed an FBI that abjectly failed\nto utilize internal controls for their intended purposes:\n66  Part of the problem is that the FISA files subject to internal reviews are telegraphed in\nadvance to FBI field offices.  As the March 2020 Management Advisory Memorandum disclosed,\nprior to such reviews, “field offices are given advance notification of which FISA application(s)\nwill be reviewed and are expected to compile documentary evidence to support the relevant FISA\napplication(s).”  Id., at 4.\n105\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 119 of 143 PageID #:\n2273\nFBI OGC personnel told us, however, that the FBI CDC and NSD\n[Office of Intelligence] accuracy review reports had not been used in\na comprehensive, strategic fashion by FBI Headquarters to assess the\nperformance of individuals involved in and accountable for FISA\napplications,  to  identify  trends  in  results  of  the  reviews,  or  to\ncontribute to an evaluation of the efficacy of quality assurance\nmechanisms  intended  to  ensure  that  FISA  applications  were\n“scrupulously accurate.”  That is, the accuracy reviews were not being\nused by the FBI as a tool to help assess the FBI's compliance with its\nWoods Procedures.\nMarch 2020 Management Advisory Memorandum, at 6.\nThe September 2021 DoJ OIG Audit also place the blame squarely on the lack of supervision\nand the weakness of internal controls:\nWe believe that these shortcomings occurred primarily because the\nFBI and NSD generally did not place sufficient emphasis or attention\non the need for rigorous supervisory review of a completed Woods\nFile and robust oversight of the Woods Procedures during the time\nperiod covered by our review.\nId., at 7.\nLikewise, the September 2021 DoJ OIG Audit remarked\nInternal oversight, like supervision, is an integral piece of the quality\nassurance process.  Effective internal oversight should not only\ninclude the identification of errors or weaknesses in quality assurance\nbut  also  the  determination  of  what  is  causing  the  errors  or\nweaknesses. \nId., at 20.  \nNevertheless, the September 2021 DoJ OIG Audit concluded that “FBI and NSD have not\nused their existing internal oversight roles and mechanisms to their full potential, and this less than\noptimal oversight has resulted in submission to the FISC of FISA applications that do not meet the\nFBI’s scrupulously accurate standard.”  Id.  For example, “FBI does not have a designated entity that\n106\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 120 of 143 PageID #:\n2274\nis responsible for ensuring accountability and efficacy of the Woods Procedures across the FBI,\nwhich limits the effectiveness of the FBI’s internal oversight abilities.”  Id., at 22.\nNor were the errors difficult for supervisors to discern.  The March 2020 Management\nAdvisory Memorandum pointed out that “FBI’s comprehensive, strategic examination of the results\nof these reviews would have put the FBI on notice that the Woods Procedures were not consistently\nexecuted thoroughly and rigorously for applications submitted during our review period so as to help\nensure the FBI’s FISA applications were ‘scrupulously accurate.’” March 2020 Management\nAdvisory Memorandum, at 6 (emphasis added).67\nThe FBI’s and NSD’s reaction to the OIG’s earlier December 2019 and March 2020 reports\nhas also been problematic.  According to the September 2021 DoJ OIG Audit, “certain public\nstatements from FBI and NSD officials appeared to display a tolerance for error that is inconsistent\nwith the FBI’s policy that applications be scrupulously accurate.”  Id., at 7.

Demers stated in a DoJ\npress release, \nWe are pleased that our review of these applications concluded that\nall contained sufficient basis for probable cause and uncovered\nonly two material errors, neither of which invalidated the\nauthorizations granted by the FISA Court.

Kris, a former high-\nranking DoJ national security lawyer with vast experience with FISA, see 945 F.3d at 650-54\n110\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 124 of 143 PageID #:\n2278\n(citing Mr. Kris’s treatise), to evaluate the adequacy of those corrective measures.  In a January 15,\n2020, letter to FISC Chief Judge James E. Boasberg, Mr. Kris reported that “that the FBI’s proposed\nCorrective Actions are insufficient and must be expanded and improved in order to provide the\nrequired assurance to the Court.”  See January 15, 2020, Letter from David S. Kris, at 2, available\nat https://bit.ly/3sd7410.  \nMr. Kris also reiterated that while “the government must adhere to a strict duty of candor and\naccuracy before the Court[,] . . .  Nor can there be any dispute that the government has profoundly\nfailed to meet that duty.”  Id., at 4.  Mr. Kris added that “[t]he FBI’s recent failures, however, are\negregious enough to warrant serious consideration of significant reform.”  Id., at 8.  That “significant\nreform” has not occurred despite continued evidence, in the 2020 FISC Op., that non-compliance\nand abuses persist.70\nMoreover, the failure of internal controls runs across the law enforcement and intelligence\ncommunity that conducts FISA surveillance pursuant to appropriate minimization protocols.  In\nDecember 2019, the NSA OIG “conducted [a] study to determine whether NSA’s implementation\nof controls for aging-off signals intelligence (SIGINT) data is compliant with law and policy.”  See\nOFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY/CENTRAL SECURITY SERVICE,\nSPECIAL  STUDY  OF  NSA  CONTROLS  TO  COMPLY  WITH  SIGNALS  INTELLIGENCE  RETENTION\n70  The 2017 FISC Op. reported that at an October 26, 2016, hearing (see ante, at 55-56),\n“the Court ascribed the government’s failure to disclose [certain internal] reviews at the October\n4, 2016 hearing to an institutional ‘lack of candor’ on NSA’s part and emphasized that ‘this is a\nvery serious Fourth Amendment issue.’  October 26, 2016 Transcript at 5-6.”  Id., at 19-20.  As a\nresult, “[t]he Court found that, in light of the recent revelations, it did not have sufficient\ninformation to assess  whether  the proposed  minimization  procedures  accompanying the Initial\n2016 Certifications would comply with statutory and Fourth Amendment requirements, as\nimplemented.”  Id.  Yet what followed were four more years of approvals.\n111\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 125 of 143 PageID #:\n2279\nREQUIREMENTS  –  UNCLASSIFIED  SUMMARY  3  (December  12,  2019),  available  at\nhttps://bit.ly/3oWYPUJ.\nThe report stated that “[t]he OIG’s findings reflect significant risks of noncompliance with\nlegal and policy requirements for retention of SIGINT data.”  Id.  Those “requirements include\nestablished minimization procedures for NSA SIGINT authorities, meaning that the deficiencies we\nidentified have the potential to impact civil liberties and individual privacy.”  Id.\nWhile NSA “implemented system compliance certification standards in 2010 to provide\nreasonable assurance that NSA systems operate in accordance with the laws and policies that address\ncivil liberties and individual privacy[,]” id., at 4, nearly a decade later those standards had still not\nbeen met (or even fully implemented.  Id., at 6 (“[p]lanned updates to NSA retention policy and\nimplementation guidance have been delayed and do not incorporate all current legal and policy\nrequirements”).\nAgain, as with FBI and NSD, while “NSA has established an internal compliance standard\nfor verification of age-off activities[,] . . . the OIG found that the Agency’s current oversight efforts\nand controls are insufficient to meet the standard and ensure compliance with data retention\nrequirements.”  Id., at 7 (emphasis added).\nConsequently, FBI, NSD, and NSA have had ample opportunity to correct FISA’s, and\nSection 702’s, serious and recurring problems through supervision and internal review.  They have\nfailed to do so abysmally, and cannot be delegated that responsibility unilaterally to ensure\ncompliance with the statutory and constitutional imperatives.71\n71  See also Elizabeth Goitein, “ODNI’s 2019 Statistical Transparency Report:  The FBI\nViolates FISA…Again,” Just Security, May 11, 2020, available at https://bit.ly/3sh2OxH (“[t]he\nnews that the FBI violated the warrant requirement is just the latest in a remarkable series of\n112\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 126 of 143 PageID #:\n2280\n2.  Criticism of the FISC’s Ability to Perform Its Necessary Oversight Function\nCompounding the problem of ex parte review of FISA and FAA materials once a criminal\nprosecution is commenced are the FISC’s historical institutional limitations as an independent factor\nin reining in abuse of FISA and FAA authority, and the fact that the FISC’s capacity for oversight\nof Section 702 (50 U.S.C. §1881a) electronic surveillance, acquisition, and retention (including\nquerying) is so narrowly defined by statute.\nRegarding the former, unlike the judiciary’s traditional threshold Fourth Amendment role\nas a gatekeeper for particular acts of surveillance, the FISC’s role in Section 702 electronic\nsurveillance is simply to ratify in advance the vaguest parameters pursuant to which the government\nis then free to conduct acquisition of communications for up to one year.  In the alternative, the FISC\nalso engages in dialogue with DoJ in order to amend applications with the objective of facilitating\nsubsequent approval of re-submitted Section 702 minimization, targeting, querying, and other\nprotocols.  See, e.g., 2018 FISC Op., at 92-94;  2020 FISC Op., at 38.72\nrevelations. . . .   These incidents follow a decade in which the government failed (for several\nyears) to report the collection of purely domestic communications under Section 702, and then\nfailed (for several more years) to comply with the procedures that the Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Court imposed to remedy the resulting Fourth Amendment violation”).\n72  A former NSA attorney has advanced the position that the FISC is powerless to deny\nSection 702 applications, but can only modify them in a manner that conforms them to statutory\nand constitutional standards.  See George Croner, “To Oversee or to Overrule: What is the Role\nof the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court Under FISA Section 702?” Lawfare, May 18,\n2021, available at https://bit.ly/325x8jB. Thus, according to Mr. Croner, even if the FISC\nconcluded that certain proposed or already-conducted Section 702  surveillance and/or querying\nfundamentally violated the Fourth Amendment – for instance, because it involves the warrantless\ncollection, querying, and use of U.S. persons’ communications – the FISC could not simply deny\nthe application, but instead would be limited to offering the government a means to “correct any\ndeficiency identified.”  Id., citing 50 U.S.C. §1881a(j)(3)(B)(I)\n113\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 127 of 143 PageID #:\n2281\nNor, unlike courts discharging their requisite Fourth Amendment responsibilities, does the\nFISC consider individualized and particularized surveillance applications, or make individualized\nprobable cause determinations, or supervise the implementation of the government’s targeting or\nminimization procedures.73  \nIn addition, as set forth ante, at 100, the government has even advanced the position that\ncertain of the FISCR’s decisions are not reviewable by the U.S. Supreme Court.  See ACLU v. United\nStates, 142 S. Ct. at 23 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting from the denial of certiorari). \nIndeed, the FISC is for practical purposes at the mercy of the Executive agencies’ willingness\nto be forthright and complete in their presentations to the FISC.  As the September 2021 DoJ IG\nAudit recognized, at 2, “[d]uring its review of the application, the FISC relies on the government’s\ndeclaration that the information supporting probable cause is factually sound[,]” admonishing that\n“[t]herefore, it is imperative that the FISC has confidence in the accuracy of the FISA applications\nsubmitted on behalf of the FBI.”74\n73   Nor are judicial rulings from the FISC precedential, as they have not been issued in\nthe context of “Cases” or “Controversies” within the constitutional meaning of Article III\nbecause only one party was involved.  See Camreta v. Greene, 131 S. Ct. 2020, 2028 (2011)\n(authority to adjudicate legal disputes requires adverse litigants with the “concrete adverseness\nwhich sharpens the presentation of issues”), (quoting Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101\n(1983)).\n74  As the September 2021 DoJ OIG Audit points out, \nFISC proceedings are ex parte, meaning that unlike most court\nproceedings, the government is present but the government’s\ncounterparty is not, and FISA orders generally are not subject to\nscrutiny through subsequent adversarial proceedings.  As a result,\nthe FBI and NSD FISA application process is critical to ensuring\nthat DOJ officials asked to authorize FISA applications, and judges\non the FISC asked to approve them, have a complete and accurate\nset of facts in the FISA application on which they can rely.\n114\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 128 of 143 PageID #:\n2282\nThe FISC’s response to the non-compliance and abuses detailed in the DoJ OIG’s December\n2019 Report illustrates the inability of the FISC to act as an effective brake on FISA violations.  In\na December 17, 2019, Order in In re Accuracy Concerns Regarding FBI Matters Submitted to the\nFISC, Docket No. Misc. 19-02, available at https://bit.ly/3p0zAB3, FISC Presiding Judge Collyer,\nnoted that “[w]hen FBI personnel mislead NSD in the ways described [in the DoJ OIG’s Report],\nthey equally mislead the FISC.”  Id., at 1.  \nThe Order endeavored to stress “the seriousness of that misconduct and its implications[,]”\nid., including documentation of “troubling instances[,]” id., at 2, and, citing from FISC opinions\nfrom 2007 through 2015, pointed out the government’s duty of candor to the FISC, which it\ndescribed as “fundamental to this Court’s effective operations . . .”  Id., at 2, (quoting No. [Redacted\n], Mem . Op. and Order issued on Nov. 6 , 2015, at 59 , available at\nhttps://bit.ly/3ytWi7K).\nHowever, the Order also noted that the FISC first learned of certain of the misstatements and\nomissions as early as July 2018, and of others months prior to issuance of the DoJ OIG’s December\n2019 Report, yet acted only after the DoJ OIG’s report was released publicly.  See id., at 1 n.1.\nUltimately, the Order admonished that \n[t]he frequency with which representations made by FBI personnel\nturned out to be unsupported or contradicted by information in their\npossession, and with which they withheld information detrimental to\ntheir case, calls into question whether information contained in other\nFBI applications is reliable.\nId., at 3.\nId., at I.

In addition, in a subsequent opinion, the FISC continued to authorize Section 702\nsurveillance despite identifying continuing violations of the backdoor search protocols.  See, e.g.,\n2020 FISC Op., at 41, 43-44 (“widespread violations of the querying standard” with “similar\nviolations of Section 702(f)(2) likely hav[ing] occurred across the [FBI]”).75\nIn fact, the 2020 FISC Op. notes more than once that the violations described therein were\nthe same as had occurred the previous year, and had even been pointed out in the 2019 FISC Op. \nSee 2020 FISC Op., at 42-43.  See also Muhtorov, 2021 WL 5817486, at *92 n.35 (Lucero, J.,\ndissenting) (“[t]here is ample evidence that the Executive routinely fails to comply with the\nFISC-approved procedures without facing any sanction”), citing 2020 FISC Op. and 2018 FISC Op.,\nat 76-82;  Jake Laperruque, “Key Takeaways From Latest FISA Court Opinion on Section 702 and\nFBIWarrantless Queries,” Just Security, April 28, 2021 (“Laperruque: Key Takeaways”), at 4,\navailable at https://bit.ly/3Fp845R, at 1, 3 (“despite this long-running pattern” violations, FISC’s\ncontinued approvals of FBI’s querying procedures” leads to the conclusion that “even if we did\nexpect the frequent compliance problems to be remedied, the newly declassified opinion shows the\ncurrent court approval requirements are woefully inadequate”).76\n75  The FISC stated its approval was due to its “lack[ of] sufficient information at this\ntime to assess the adequacy of the FBI system changes and training, post- implementation.”  2020\nFISC Op., at 44.  Notwithstanding a decade of persistent FBI non-compliance documented\nannually in the FISC’s opinions, the FISC nevertheless determined that “[t]he number and nature\nof the reported querying violations nonetheless suggest that ongoing monitoring and auditing will\nbe critical to evaluationg whether the current measures are adequate.”  Id.\n76  See also Order, In re Accuracy Concerns Regarding FBI Matters Submitted to the\nFISC, Docket No. Misc. 19-02, April 3, 2020, available at https://bit.ly/327oUHU (because\n“[t]he [March 2020 Management Advisory Memorandum] provides further reason for systemic\nconcern[,]” ordering the government to report to the FISC whether any of the FISA applications\n116\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 130 of 143 PageID #:\n2284\nConsequently, in the wake of the disclosures of the Section 702’s (and other FISA programs’)\nvast and unprecedented dragnet approach to electronic surveillance, through the years the FISC has\nbeen the subject of much criticism and reconsideration.77  As the Congressional Research Service\nnotes, “[r]ecent controversies over the nature of the government’s foreign surveillance activity have\nprompted some to argue that the judiciary’s review of government surveillance requests under the\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) should be far more exacting.”  Andrew Nolan,\nRichard M.

Critics of the\ncurrent FISA proceedings have cited the infrequency of the FISC’s\nrejections of government surveillance request as evidence that the\nlack of an adversarial process has prevented the court from fully and\nin questions “involved material misstatements or omissions”).  Naturally, the government’s\nreview exonerated itself.

Freedom Act of 2015 established a process by which FISC judges may\nappoint an amicus curiae attorney to advise on legal issues in a limited number of cases (and with\nthat lawyer’s limited access to the factual information presented by the government to the FISC), see\n50 U.S.C. §1803(I), that has not ameliorated the problems.

Moreover, the amicus is not permitted to “represent U.S.\npersons subject to surveillance orders” or “petition FISC to certify a question of law to the FISCR\nfor appellate review.”  Id.  The amicus’s role is contingent upon the discretion of the FISC, both\ninitially to be appointed and subsequently to have access to sufficient evidence to effectively\nparticipate.

It has been left\nto this Court, with the assistance of security-cleared defense counsel if this Court permits, to do so,\nand not merely another legion of insiders who have ignored every directive to that effect.\nG.  The Nature and Type of Disclosure This Court \nShould Order the Government to Provide Herein\nThe Second Circuit’s opinion contemplates a thorough fact-finding by this Court.  See, e.g.,\nHasbajrami, 945 F.3d at 661, 677.  See also ante, at 27-30.  In order to conduct that review, in\naddition to receiving (and disclosing to security-cleared defense counsel) the materials voluntarily\nprovided by the government, it is respectfully submitted that this Court should require the\ngovernment  to  disclose  the  following  information,  all  of  which  is  relevant  to  whether  the\nsurveillance, including querying, was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment:\n(1)  information about the rules and procedures governing the querying and use of Section\n702 information at the time Mr. Hasbajrami was investigated;\n(2)  each of the Section 702 queries FBI agents or analysts conducted that sought or\nproduced information about Mr. Hasbajrami;\n(3)  what query terms were used by FBI, when, and by whom;\nstreamlining internal reviews in order not to tax DoJ and FBI resources than with measures that\nwould ensure elimination of FISA non-compliance and abuses.

But see Tweak or Overhaul (Mr. Klein’s\n“modest procedural tweaks . . . do not, in my view, get at the root cause of dysfunction in the\nFISA process:  the fact that ‘FISA applications are not tested in the adversarial process, and FISA\nsurveillance is classified’”).\n122\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 136 of 143 PageID #:\n2290\n(4)  what databases were searched by FBI, and with respect to the Section 702-acquired\ndata in these databases, what was the volume of that data, how many communications\nwere included, and how many individuals' communications were included;\n(5)  what justifications and/or reasons did FBI agents or analysts provide for the queries;\n(6)  did the FISA applications, the renewal applications, and/or the querying process,\ninclude or account for “information to suggest that Individual #1 was not in fact a\nterrorist, and that he solicited funds from the defendant for purposes unrelated to\nterrorism.”  See PSR, at ¶ 3.

The Impact on Mr. Hasbajrami’s Conditional Plea of Guilty\nThe Circuit recognized in its opinion that should Mr. Hasbajrami prevail, and the evidence\nbe suppressed, he would be entitled to withdraw his guilty plea, Hasbajrami, 945 F.3d 675-76, which\nwould be a formality because it is believed that the entirety of the government’s case – or at least that\nportion that would render it legally sufficient – against Mr. Hasbajrami emanates in some fashion\nfrom the Section 702 surveillance and any subsequent backdoor searches.\nAccordingly, Mr. Hasbajrami’s guilty plea would be withdrawn concurrent with dismissal\nof the prosecution against him outright.\nPOINT II\nMR. HASBAJRAMI IS ENTITLED TO NOTICE OF \nTHE ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE TECHNIQUES \nTHE GOVERNMENT EMPLOYED IN ITS INVESTIGATION\nThe Constitution, applicable statutes, and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure entitle Mr.\nHasbajrami to notice of whatever other surveillance tools, including a definitive answer with respect\nto backdoor searches, the government utilized in its investigation(s) of Mr. Hasbajrami beyond the\nsimple Section 702 and traditional FISA interceptions.\n124\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 138 of 143 PageID #:\n2292\nA.  Notice Is Required By the Constitution\nSubsequent to the Second Circuit’s decision herein, the Ninth Circuit, in United States v.\nMoalin, 973 F.3d 977, 997-1001 (9th Cir. 2020), ruled that that the Fourth Amendment required the\ngovernment to provide notice of its collection and use of a defendant’s telephone metadata under\nSection 215, as well as other forms of foreign intelligence surveillance. \nAs the Court stated\n[T]he Fourth Amendment requires notice to a criminal defendant\nwhen the prosecution intends to enter into evidence or otherwise use\nor disclose information obtained or derived from surveillance of that\ndefendant  conducted  pursuant  to  the  government’s  foreign\nintelligence surveillance authorities.\nMoalin, 973 F.3d at 1000.\nIn fact, the circumstances replicate in many respects the collection/querying circumstances\npresent here:  the defendant’s (as well as essentially all persons in the U.S.’s) call records were\ncollected pursuant to Section 215.  See also ACLU v. Clapper, 785 F.3d at 826. In Moalin, that\nmetadata was resident in a database the government subsequently searched to match defendant’s\ntelephone number with that which was a party to a suspicious call.  See Moalin, 973 F.3d at 987-88.82\nThe constitutional imperative of notice is a longstanding principle.  The Supreme Court and\nappellate courts have long recognized that the Constitution requires notice of government searches\n82  In Moalin, while the Court determined, on the basis of the classified record, that\nany lack of notice was not prejudicial to the defendants, its Fourth Amendment\nholding supports Mr. Hasbajrami’s right to notice here.  Moalin, 973 F.3d at 1001. The Court’s\ndecision in Moalin not to remand the case to the District Court for Alderman disclosures and a\nsuppression hearing was based on “the particular circumstances of [the Moalin] case,” and “in a\ndifferent case,” disclosure under Alderman might be required in order for the defense to\n“intelligently litigate” a challenge to unlawful surveillance – including the government’s\ncollection of metadata.  Id.\n125\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 139 of 143 PageID #:\n2293\n– especially surreptitious searches.  See Berger, 388 U.S. at 60;  Dalia v. United States, 441 U.S.\n238, 247-48 (1979); United States v. Donovan, 429 U.S. 413, 429-30 & n.19 (1977) (Title III’s\nnotice provisions “satisfy constitutional requirements”);  United States v. Chun, 503 F.2d 533,\n536-38 & n.6 (9th Cir. 1974) (same).\nAlthough Berger and Dalia do not require disclosure of each minute technical detail involved\nin the surveillance, those two cases do require notice of basic information about the searches, so that\n(among other things) a defendant may bring an informed motion to suppress.  See Berger, 388 U.S.\nat 60;  Dalia, 441 U.S. at 247-48.\nIn addition, the government’s Fifth Amendment Due Process obligation pursuant to Brady\nv. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), requires disclosure of information that could affect the outcome\nof a suppression hearing.  See United States v. Gamez-Orduno, 235 F.3d 353, 461 (9th Cir. 2000); \nSmith v. Black, 904 F. 2d 950, 965-66 (5th Cir. 1990), vacated on other grounds, 503 U.S. 930\n(1992).\nReliance on overbroad and contrived claims of secrecy to refuse to produce such material and\ninformation denies Mr. Hasbajrami Due Process.  Exaggerated or false claims of the need for secrecy\ncannot overcome a defendant’s constitutional interest in an adversarial proceeding that ensures it will\nbe fair and accurate.  See Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. at 60-61;  Matthews v. Eldridge, 424\nU.S. 319, 335 (1976).  See also James Bovard, “Supreme Court Should End ‘State Secrets’\nPrivilege,” The American Conservative, November 16, 2021, available at https://bit.ly/3q52a3k\n126\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 140 of 143 PageID #:\n2294\n(“State Secrets doctrine provides a license for federal agencies to lie to their victims and to federal\njudges”).83\nB.  Notice Is Required By the Federal Statutes and Rules\nNotice is also mandated by 18 U.S.C. §3504, and does not permit the government to\ncondition notice on its own determination of whether its evidence was tainted.84  Rather, upon a\ncolorable claim like Mr. Hasbajrami’s, the statute requires the government to affirm or deny the\nprecise forms of surveillance.  See 18 U.S.C. §3504(a)(1);  United States v. Apple, 915 F.2d 899,\n904-06 (4th Cir. 1990).  At that point it is incumbent upon the parties to litigate whether the\nsurveillance was unlawful, and which evidence flowed from it.  See United States v. Hamide, 914\nF.2d 1147, 1149 (9th Cir. 1990);  Apple, 915 F.3d at 906, 909-10.\nAs the Court in Muhtorov explained, 18 U.S.C. §3504 “contemplates a multi-step process. \nThe defendant must allege unlawful use.  If the allegations are sufficient to require a response, the\n83  In his article, Mr. Bovard observes that a case currently before the Supreme Court in a\ncivil context, Husayn v. Mitchell, 938 F.3d 1123 (2nd Cir. 2021), cert. granted United States v.\nZubaydah, No. 20-827 (Oct. 6, 2021), offers “a superb opportunity to debunk that pernicious\nlegal doctrine that has become a protective wall around the worst abuses of the war on terror[,]”\nas “[t]he FBI has been able to trample Americans’ rights and privacy because it shrouds its\nabuses.”  The article also notes that the case establishing the state secrets privilege, Reynolds v.\nUnited States, 345 U.S. 1 (1953), involved a false claim of national security to hide a cover-up of\nthe crash of a B-29 bomber.  The Air Force said that any disclosure of the case would expose\nvital national security secrets, and the Court deferred to the military.  Half a century later, the\ngovernment declassified the official report which contained no national security secrets but\nproved that negligence caused the crash.  Id.  See also BARRY SIEGEL, CLAIM OF PRIVILEGE\n(2008).\n84  18 U.S.C. §3504(a)(1) reads as follows:  “upon a claim by a party aggrieved that\nevidence is inadmissible because it is the primary product of an unlawful act or because it was\nobtained by the exploitation of an unlawful act, the opponent of the claim shall affirm or deny the\noccurrence of the alleged unlawful act[].”\n127\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 141 of 143 PageID #:\n2295\ngovernment issues a confirmation or denial.  The court must then weigh whether disclosure is\nwarranted based on the sufficiency of the government's explanation.”  2021 WL 785 F.3d 787, at *45\nSuch notice is also required under Rule 16(a)(1)(E)’s “materiality” provision.  Rule\n16(a)(1)(E) plainly “permits discovery related to the constitutionality of a search or seizure.”  United\nStates v. Soto-Zuniga, 837 F.3d 992, 998, 1000-01 (9th Cir. 2016).  See also United States v. Hanna,\n661 F.3d 271, 295 (6th Cir. 2011) (information is discoverable if it is “relevant” and “helpful” to a\nmotion to suppress).\nIn addition, even under statutorily authorized programs, the government regularly conceals\ncertain pivotal aspects of its electronic surveillance and evidence collection.  See Charlie Savage,\n“Door May Open for Challenge to Secret Wiretaps,” The New York Times, October 16, 2013,\navailable at http://nyti.ms/1r7mbDy (describing government's continuing efforts to avoid giving\nnotice of Executive Order 12,333 surveillance);  id. (describing government’s five-year effort to\navoid giving notice of FAA surveillance such as occurred herein).  See also Dark Side: Secret\nOrigins of Evidence in U.S. Criminal Cases, Human Rights Watch, January 9, 2018, at *1, available\nat https://bit.ly/3DZAcuT (“a growing body of evidence suggests” that U.S. intelligence agencies\nobtain information about U.S. persons “incidentally” through foreign intelligence surveillance, share\nit with federal, state, and/or local law enforcement agencies, which then “re-discover[] the evidence\nin some other way” to create an alternative, sanitized version of how the information was acquired”); \nJohn Shiffman & Kristina Cooke, “U.S. Directs Agents to Cover Up Program Used to Investigate\nAmericans,” Reuters, August 5, 2013, available at http://reut.rs/15xWJwH (describing “parallel\nconstruction” as “just like money laundering – you work it backwards to make it clean”);  id.\n(“[a]lthough these case rarely involve national security issues, documents reviewed by Reuters show\n128\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-LDH     Document 191     Filed 12/24/21     Page 142 of 143 PageID #:\n2296\nthat law enforcement agents have been directed to conceal how such investigations truly begin – not\nonly from defense lawyers but also sometimes from prosecutors and judges”);  Ronan Farrow, “How\na C.I.A. Coverup Targeted a Whistle-blower,” The New Yorker, October 30, 2020, available at\nhttps://bit.ly/3F7t54X (DoJ whistleblower “realized that C.I.A. officers and F.B.I. agents, in violation\nof federal law and Department of Justice guidelines, had concealed the information’s origins from\nfederal prosecutors, leaving judges and defense lawyers in the dark. Critics call such concealment\n‘intelligence laundering’”).85\nEven in the FISA context of national security, effective notice is not a shell game in which\na defendant must guess at which programs or techniques the government has employed, and whether\nthey contributed in some fashion to the government’s investigation.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1806(c) (FIFA); \n18 U.S.C. § 2518(8)(d) (Title III).  Accordingly, Mr. Hasbajrami is entitled to notice and the\nopportunity to challenge the surveillance tools that the government used in its investigation.86\n85  Due Process rights grounded in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments entitle criminal\ndefendants to know how the government monitored their communications and activities, and\nthen to challenge – in an adversarial proceeding – whether the government’s evidence has been\nderived from that surveillance, and to seek suppression of the resulting evidence that was\nobtained unlawfully.  See, e.g., United States v. United States District Court (Keith), 407 U.S.\n297 (1972);  Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165 (1969).  See also United States v. Gelbard,\n408 U.S. 41 (1972).  See also Wong Sun, 371 U.S. at 486-88 (describing “fruit of the poisonous\ntree” doctrine);  Murray v. United States, 487 U.S. 533, 536-37 (1988) (describing right to seek\nsuppression of evidence “derived” from an unlawful search).\n86  Even beyond this case, the government’s withholding of notice of electronic\nsurveillance is now widespread.  See generally Patrick C. Toomey & Brett Max Kaufman, The\nNotice Paradox: Secret Surveillance, Criminal Defendants, & the Right to Notice, 54 SANTA\nCLARA L.

IRIZARRY, Chief United States District Judge: \n  On April 17, 2017, Defendant Agron Hasbajrami (“Defendant”) filed a letter seeking \nreconsideration of this Court’s April 6, 2017 Memorandum and Order (“M & O”) denying \nDefendant’s motion to grant his counsel access to the redacted portions of the Honorable John \nGleeson’s  February  18,  2016  decision  denying  Defendant’s  motion  to  suppress  intercepted \nelectronic communications.  (See Defendant’s Letter for Reconsideration (“Def. Ltr.”), Dkt. Entry \nNo. 172.)  Per the Court’s instruction, the government responded on May 1, 2017.  (See Response \nto Defendant’s Letter (“Gov. Resp.”), Dkt. Entry No. 173.)   \n“The standard for granting [a motion for reconsideration] is strict, and reconsideration will \ngenerally be denied unless the moving party can point to controlling decisions or data that the court \noverlooked—matters, in other words, that might reasonably be expected to alter the conclusion \nreached by the court.”  Shrader v. CSX Transp., Inc., 70 F.3d 255, 257 (2d Cir. 1995) (internal \ncitations omitted).  Typical grounds for reconsideration include “‘an intervening change of \ncontrolling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent \nmanifest injustice.’”  Kolel Beth Yechiel Mechil of Tartikov, Inc. v. YLL Irrevocable Tr., 729 F.3d \n99, 104 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting Virgin Atl. Airways, Ltd. v. Nat'l Mediation Bd., 956 F.2d 1245, \n1255 (2d Cir.1992)).  “[A] motion for reconsideration is not an opportunity for litigants to reargue \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 174   Filed 08/22/17   Page 2 of 3 PageID #: 1805\ntheir previous positions or present new or alternative theories that they failed to set forth in \nconnection with the underlying motion.”  Callari v. Blackman Plumbing Supply, Inc., 988 F. \nSupp.2d 261, 287 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (internal citations omitted).  \n  Defendant has not met the standard for granting a motion for reconsideration.  Defendant \nmoves for reconsideration under the disingenuous guise of seeking “clarification” as to the nature \nof the redacted information considered by Judge Gleeson.  Defendant merely restates his earlier \narguments rejected by both Judge Gleeson and this Court, without citation of any new authority or \nany facts or case law the Court did not consider.  This Court already has considered the precise \nquestions presented in Defendant’s Letter, and determined that neither the Classified Information \nProcedures Act (“CIPA”) nor the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”) compels or \nallows disclosure of an unredacted copy of Judge Gleeson’s opinion.   \n  Under FISA, this Court determined that Defendant’s counsel was not entitled to an \nunredacted copy of Judge Gleeson’s opinion “because releasing it would reveal classified foreign \nintelligence information and circumvent FISA by undermining the purpose of section 1806(f).” \n(M & O at 6.)  Further, the Court found that “FISA does not mandate disclosure in order to help \ndefendants make an appeal.”  (Id. at 7.)  \nThis Court held that “CIPA does not compel or regulate the discovery of classified \ninformation contained in a court’s written opinion.”  (Id. at 11.)  The Court noted that, “[b]ecause \nJudge Gleeson conducted his review of the classified materials by relying on FISA, the Court holds \nthat FISA determines whether or not Defendant’s attorneys have a ‘need-to-know’ the contents of \nthe Unredacted Opinion.”  (Id. at 12).  This Court concluded that, “[a]pplying FISA, defense \ncounsel do not have a ‘need-to-know’ the contents of the Unredacted Opinion” and found that \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 174   Filed 08/22/17   Page 3 of 3 PageID #: 1806\n“[t]he redacted content neither facilitates countering the government’s case nor bolsters a defense.”  \n(Id. at 13.)  \n  Accordingly, Defendant’s letter seeking reconsideration is denied. \n \nSO ORDERED.   \n \nDated: Brooklyn, New York \nAugust 22, 2017 \n                               /s/ \n              DORA L.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  ONLINE PUBLICATION ONLY  \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \n \n \n     \nAGRON HASBAJRAMI, \nPetitioner,       \n- versus -      13-CV-6852 \n \n     \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, \n \nRespondent.       \n \n \n \n    ORDER \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n       \n- versus -      11-CR-623 \n \n     \nAGRON HASBAJRAMI, \n \nDefendant.       \n \n \n \nJOHN GLEESON, United States District Judge: \nOn April 12, 2012, Agron Hasbajrami pled guilty in his criminal case, No. \n11-cr-623, to a single count of providing material support to terrorists.  See DE 32.  In January of \n2013, I imposed a 15-year sentence, the statutory maximum.  See DE 45.  After sentence was \nimposed, I dismissed three other counts on the government’s motion.  See DE 44.   \nIn July of 2013, it appears that Hasbajrami first attempted to file a pro se \ncollateral attack under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.  For reasons that are not clear, the paper filing never \nreached this Court; after some back and forth, Hasbajrami’s § 2255 proceeding was instituted in \nDecember of 2013.  Hasbajrami’s pro se filing argued only that the statute under which he was \nconvicted is unconstitutionally vague.  Before that claim could be fully briefed and argued, \nhowever, the government disclosed new information that has changed the landscape of this case. \n\nOn September 13, 2011 – before Hasbajrami pled guilty – the government \nnotified Hasbajrami that its evidence included “information obtained or derived from electronic \nsurveillance and physical searches conducted pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct of 1978 (‘FISA’), as amended, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1812 and 1821-1829.”  DE 9 (“Initial \nNotice”).  Key to the issue before me now is the government’s subsequent supplemental \ndisclosure, via a February 24, 2014 letter, of additional information about the evidence it would \nhave used in Hasbajrami’s case had it proceeded to trial.  See Supplemental Notice, DE 65 in No. \n11-cr-623.  The Supplemental Notice revealed for the first time that the government’s evidence \nincluded “information derived from acquisition of foreign intelligence information conducted \npursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as amended, 50 U.S.C. § 1881a.”   \nAuthority under § 1881a, also known as “Title VII” or “Section 702,” was \nconferred on the government by the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 (“FAA”).  In broad terms, \nthose amendments permit the government to gather an array of information from electronic \ncommunications made by people located outside the United States who are neither citizens nor \nlegal permanent residents of the United States.  See 50 U.S.C. §§ 1881a (grant of authority), \n1801(i) (definition of “United States person”).  In public debate, FAA intelligence has been \ndescribed as “warrantless wiretap” information, since, in contrast to traditional FISA authority, \nthe FAA does not require an individual court authorization (that is, a warrant) for each data \ncollection.  See, e.g., Charlie Savage, “Federal Prosecutors, in a Policy Shift, Cite Warrantless \nWiretaps as Evidence,” N.Y. Times, October 26, 2013. \nFollowing the Supplemental Notice (and before taking any action on \nHasbajrami’s pro se § 2255 petition), I reappointed counsel for Hasbajrami.  See Unnumbered \nOrder, March 13, 2014, in No. 13-cv-6852.  Hasbajrami’s attorneys sought additional \n2 \n \n\ninformation from the government about the FAA wiretaps, but the parties could not mutually \nagree on whether any specific material should be turned over.  After failing to obtain any \nmaterial on consent, Hasbajrami moved to compel.  I held argument on the motion on September \n12, 2014, and denied Hasbajrami’s motion on the record.   \nIn discussing Hasbajrami’s discovery motion, however, it became clear that his \n2012 guilty plea presents a significant barrier to many of the arguments he might present to \nchallenge his conviction.  Therefore I directed Hasbajrami to file a letter informing the Court \nwhether (as suggested by his counsel at argument) he wishes to withdraw his guilty plea in light \nof the Supplemental Notice and any other developments in the case.  By letter from counsel \ndated September 20, 2014, Hasbajrami confirmed that, contrary to his attorneys’ advice, he \nwishes to withdraw his plea.  See DE 84 in No. 11-cr-623.  \nHasbajrami’s guilty plea presents a serious obstacle to his ability to collaterally \nattack his conviction: \nA plea of guilty and the ensuing conviction comprehend all of the \nfactual and legal elements necessary to sustain a binding, final \njudgment of guilt and a lawful sentence. Accordingly, when the \njudgment of conviction upon a guilty plea has become final and the \noffender seeks to reopen the proceeding, the inquiry is ordinarily \nconfined to whether the underlying plea was both counseled and \nvoluntary. If the answer is in the affirmative then the conviction \nand the plea, as a general rule, foreclose the collateral attack. \n \nUnited States v. Broce, 488 U.S. 563, 569 (1989).  In Broce and other cases, the Supreme Court \nhas made clear that a guilty plea generally extinguishes claims of any “antecedent constitutional \nviolations.”  Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 266 (1973). \nThere are two well-recognized exceptions to the general waiver principle.  First, \nas outlined in the excerpt from Broce, the defendant may argue that the plea was not voluntary \n(for example, obtained by threat) or that the defendant did not know the consequences of \n3 \n \n\npleading guilty (for example, the defendant was misled about the possible punishments he would \nface).  But the bar is high:  “[T]he law ordinarily considers a waiver knowing, intelligent, and \nsufficiently aware if the defendant fully understands the nature of the right and how it would \nlikely apply in general in the circumstances – even though the defendant may not know the \nspecific detailed consequences of invoking it.”  United States v. Ruiz, 536 U.S. 622, 628-30 \n(2002) (emphasis in original).  Thus, courts will usually hold enforceable a criminal defendant’s \nwaiver of his right to additional disclosures by the government,1 as long as the defendant \nunderstands prior to his waiver the sorts of material he would generally be entitled to if the case \nwent to trial.  See Ruiz, 536 U.S. at 629-33 (government was not required to turn over potential \nimpeachment material to defendant prior to guilty plea).  \nSecond, in rare cases, a conviction may be collaterally attacked notwithstanding a \nguilty plea where “on the face of the record the court had no power to enter the conviction or \nimpose the sentence.”  Broce, 488 U.S. at 569.  The most notable recent examples include \ncriminal defendants who pled guilty to a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) based on a reading of \nthe law later held to be erroneous in Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 144 (1995).  Later, \nsome petitioners whose offense conduct appeared not to violate the statute (as construed by \nBailey) were permitted to withdraw their pleas on the theory that they simply had not committed \na criminal act.  See generally Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614 (1998).  Perhaps \nHasbajrami’s pro se argument (that the statute under which he was convicted is \nunconstitutionally vague) could be thought to fall into this category, but here too he would face \ngreat difficulty.  Cf. United States v. Yousef, 750 F.3d 254, 260 (2d Cir. 2014) (holding that the \ndefendant’s plea agreement waived a challenge to extraterritorial application of the material \nsupport statute). \n                                                 \n1   Hasbajrami waived additional disclosures in this case.  See Final Plea Agreement ¶ 4. \n4 \n \n\nThe parties also appear to agree on a third exception:  “in extraordinary \ncircumstances where the defendant has been induced to plead guilty by egregious \nmisrepresentations or other serious misconduct, a court may find that the defendant was deprived \nof his ability to plead guilty voluntarily.”  Govt. Br. 21-22, DE 25 in No. 13-cv-6852 (citing \nBousley).  This theory derives from a reading of the Supreme Court’s opinion in Brady v. United \nStates, 397 U.S. 742 (1970), where the Court wrote that a knowing and voluntary guilty plea \n“must stand unless induced by threats (or promises to discontinue improper harassment), \nmisrepresentation (including unfulfilled or unfulfillable promises), or perhaps by promises that \nare by their nature improper as having no proper relationship to the prosecutor’s business (e.g. \nbribes).”  Id. at 755 (quoting Shelton v. United States, 246 F.2d 571, 572 n. 2 (5th Cir. 1957) (en \nbanc), rev’d on confession of error on other grounds, 356 U.S. 26 (1958)).  Recent applications \nof this exception include United States v. Fisher, 711 F.3d 460, 465-66 (4th Cir. 2013) and \nFerrara v. United States, 456 F.3d 278, 290 (1st Cir. 2006).  Both Fisher and Ferrara involved \negregious governmental conduct:  in Fisher, a DEA agent lied about the source of information \nused to obtain a warrant as part of a larger pattern of self-enriching criminal activity, see 711 \nF.3d at 463; and in Ferrara, members of the prosecution knowingly withheld and then \nmanipulated evidence that the defendant had not ordered a murder he pled guilty to committing, \nsee 456 F.3d at 281-86.  In independently researching this question, I have not found any Second \nCircuit decisions citing either Fisher or Ferrara with approval, nor any other recent Second \nCircuit case with such an expansive interpretation of the relevant language from Brady v. United \nStates.  Indeed, I am not convinced that Ferrara, and especially Fisher, were correctly decided, \nor that the government is correct to concede that Brady v. United States should be read so \nbroadly.  But I defer to the able prosecutors arguing the government’s case and decide the \n5 \n \n\nmotion on the terms on which it has been presented – which does not require me to address the \nlegal merits of the third exception. \nRather, I will permit Hasbajrami to withdraw his plea of guilty because I conclude \nthat he was not sufficiently informed about the facts.  Under the precise circumstances presented \nhere, and because of a DOJ policy that transcended this case, Hasbajrami could not have made an \nintelligent decision about whether to plead guilty:  When the government provided FISA notice \nwithout FAA notice, Hasbajrami was misled about an important aspect of his case. \nThe government’s Initial Notice informed Hasbajrami that the prosecution’s \nevidence included material obtained through FISA-authorized wiretaps.  This notice was made \npursuant to FISA’s notice provision, which states in full as follows: \nWhenever the Government intends to enter into evidence or \notherwise use or disclose in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding \nin or before any court, department, officer, agency, regulatory \nbody, or other authority of the United States, against an aggrieved \nperson, any information obtained or derived from an electronic \nsurveillance of that aggrieved person pursuant to the authority of \nthis subchapter, the Government shall, prior to the trial, hearing, or \nother proceeding or at a reasonable time prior to an effort to so \ndisclose or so use that information or submit it in evidence, notify \nthe aggrieved person and the court or other authority in which the \ninformation is to be disclosed or used that the Government intends \nto so disclose or so use such information. \n \n50 U.S.C. § 1806(c).  Notably, it is not clear from this section exactly when the government must \nprovide notice (though it must be “prior to” the proceeding or the use of the information).  That \nuncertainty matters a great deal in our current federal criminal environment, since the vast \nmajority of defendants plead guilty, and § 1806(c) does not clearly state whether the government \nmust provide FISA notice before a guilty plea.  But under the facts presented here, I need not \ndecide when the government’s legal obligation to provide notice (whether under § 1806(c) itself, \nor some other legal authority, such as due process) attaches – whether, for example, the \n6 \n \n\ngovernment must as a matter of law always provide FISA notice before a defendant pleads \nguilty.  That is because, whatever the legal requirement, the government actually provided the \nFISA notice in this case before Hasbajrami pled guilty.  And the FAA expressly incorporates the \nexact same FISA notice requirement:  it states that “[i]nformation acquired from an acquisition \nconducted under section 1881a of this title shall be deemed to be information acquired from an \nelectronic surveillance pursuant to subchapter I for purposes of section 1806 of this title . . . .”  \n50 U.S.C. § 1881e(a).   \nSince FISA and the FAA are governed by precisely the same notice requirement, \nthe government’s provision of FISA notice without FAA notice gave the overwhelming – and \nfalse – impression that no FAA-obtained information figured in the government’s case.   \nThe issue now is whether that misimpression forms a sufficient basis for \nHasbajrami to withdraw his plea.  Though it is a close question (as the government itself \ndescribed it at oral argument), I conclude that Hasbajrami should be permitted to withdraw his \nplea.   \nFirst, at oral argument, Hasbajrami’s counsel represented that, prior to his \ndecision to plead guilty, Hasbajrami had specifically asked them about whether warrantless \nwiretaps had played a role in his case.  After they informed him that such wiretaps were not part \nof the evidence, he was more willing to plead guilty.  Thus, Hasbajrami seems to have been \nmisled about a fact he considered important in deciding how to plead.   \nSecond, his interest is not simply idiosyncratic.  Warrantless wiretapping has been \ncontroversial, and due in part to the since-revised nondisclosure policy that operated in this very \ncase, there have been few rulings on the practice’s legality.  I emphasize that I express no view \nwhatsoever on the legal merits of a constitutional challenge to the FISA amendments.  But at a \n7 \n \n\nminimum, it is the kind of argument that a criminal defense attorney would want to make in this \nsort of case. \nThe government’s misleading pre-plea notice in this case prevented Hasbajrami \nfrom knowing about the availability of this legal argument.  Hasbajrami could hardly have been \nexpected to file a motion attacking the FAA without having any factual basis to support a claim \nthat warrantless wiretapping had played a role in his case.  Indeed, the compelling inference from \nthe notice he received was that surveillance pursuant to the FISA Amendments had not occurred. \nThis highlights a critical point:  Hasbajrami could not have challenged the FAA \nwithout government notice; the argument’s availability depended on facts exclusively under the \ngovernment’s control.  In the course of pretrial proceedings, the government is not required to \nadvise defendants about potential legal challenges they might make – the prosecutor need not ask \na defendant prior to plea if he has considered whether the criminal statute under which he is \ncharged exceeds Congress’s authority under the Commerce Clause, for example.  But here, the \nlegal argument Hasbajrami might have made was predicated on a fact that he could not have \nknown without government disclosure. \nThird, even if Hasbajrami cannot make a facial challenge to the FAA, it is also \npossible that the revelation of the role FAA material played in the government’s investigation \nwill lead to new fact-specific challenges to the evidence that the government would have used in \nthis case.  Hasbajrami might seek to suppress the FISA-obtained evidence not because the FAA \nis unconstitutional in general, but because of some other infirmity in its application to this \nparticular case.  I am in no position to articulate, let alone prejudge the merits of, such a \nchallenge.  But this is another reason why the belated Supplemental Notice should result in an \norder permitting Hasbajrami to withdraw his plea. \n8 \n \n\nFor these reasons, Hasbajrami’s § 2255 petition, as modified by his request for a \nvacatur of his sentence and guilty plea, is granted,2 and No. 13-cv-6852 is closed.3  The criminal \ncase, No. 11-cr-623, is reopened, and a status conference will be held on Wednesday, October \n15, 2014 to discuss the next steps in that case. \n \nSo ordered. \nJohn Gleeson, U.S.D.J. \n \n \nDated:  October 2, 2014   \n  Brooklyn, New York \n \n \n                                                 \n2   As should be clear, I do not rule on the merits of Hasbajrami’s pro se challenge to the \nconstitutionality of the material support statute; that argument is mooted by the successful withdrawal of his guilty \nplea.  \n3   I ordered the parties to file their papers in both the criminal case and the collateral attack, but it is \nclear that at this stage, Hasbajrami may not withdraw his plea based on a motion within the criminal case.  See Fed. \nR. Crim. P 11(e) (“After the court imposes sentence, the defendant may not withdraw a plea of guilty or nolo \ncontendere, and the plea may be set aside only on direct appeal or collateral attack.”). \n9 \n ",

Preliminary Statement \nOn October 2, 2014, this Court concluded, inter alia, that Defendant Agron \nHasbajrami (hereinafter, “Hasbajrami”) could “withdraw his plea of guilty because \n[this  Court]  conclude[d]  that  he  was  not  sufficiently  informed  about  the  facts,” \nnamely,  “a  DOJ  policy  that  transcended  this  case,”  which  deprived  him  of  the \nability to make “an intelligent decision about whether to plead guilty” (Order, dated, \nOctober 2, 2014 [ecf #85], at 6).   \nSuch policy, of course, was the Government’s system-wide decision to omit \nreference to warrantless surveillance under the FISA Amendments Act (hereinafter, \nthe “FAA”) when providing notice of with-warrant surveillance under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act (hereinafter, “FISA”) (id. at 6).   \nWhile this Court’s order “express[ed] no view whatsoever on the merits of a \nconstitutional challenge to the FISA amendments” (id. at 7), this Court recognized \nthat various per se and as applied challenges could be raised (id. at 8) and permit \nHasbajrami to withdraw his plea so that he could be returned to a position to do so. \nAs such, Hasbajrami, by and through his attorneys, hereby moves to suppress \nthe fruits of warrantless FAA surveillance related to his case and for other relief as \ndetailed in the following motions: \n  1\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 20 of 131 PageID #: 636\n \n1.

Background \n  Agron  Hasbajrami  was  arrested  on  September  6,  2011,  and  ultimately \ncharged with three counts of provision and attempted provision of material support \nto terrorists, and one count of attempt to provide material support to terrorists, all in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2339A(a), 2.  See Superseding Indictment, dated, January \n26, 2012.   \nAs described in Hasbajrami’s Revised Pre-Sentence Report, dated, February \n6, 2013 (hereinafter, “PSR”): \nAn  investigation  by  agents  with  the  Federal  Bureau  of \nInvestigation’s  Joint  Terrorism  Task  Force  (“JTTF”) \nrevealed that between April 2, 2011, and August 28, 2011, \nthe  defendant  engaged  in  numerous  email  transactions \nwith  individual  #1,  utilizing  different  email  accounts.  \nIndividual #1 (whose identity is known to the parties), is \nan individual the defendant believed was associated with a \nterrorism organization.  During the course of their emails, \nthe  two  arranged  for  the  transfer  of  money  from  the \ndefendant to individual #1, purportedly to support Islamic \nfundamentalist terrorism operations, and to arrange for the \ndefendant’s  travel  to  the  Federally  Administered  Tribal \nAreas (“FATA’s”) of Pakistan to join a jihadist fighting \ngroup.    More  specifically,  the  emails  discussed  and \ncontained  instructions  and  detailed  descriptions  of  the \nsmuggling route that the defendant was to take into the \nFATA,  as  well  as  contact  instructions  as  to  how  the \ndefendant would make contact with individual #1 once he \narrived in the FATA, and how money should be sent to \nindividual  #1  from  the  United  States,  via  a  courier  in \nGermany…. \n \nNotwithstanding the emails discussed … above … there is \ninformation to suggest that Individual #1 was not in fact a \n  3\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 22 of 131 PageID #: 638\n \nterrorist, and that he solicited funds from the defendant for \npurposes unrelated to terrorism. \n \nUltimately, the defendant was arrested by JTTF agents at \nJohn F. Kennedy International Airport in Jamaica, New \nYork, on September 6, 2011, prior to boarding a flight \nbound for Istanbul, Turkey.  A search of the defendant’s \nluggage subsequent to his arrest revealed a tent, boots and \ncold-weather gear.  The case agent advised that in a post-\narrest statement, the defendant admitted to the entirety of \nthe offense. \n \n(PSR at ¶¶ 2-3) (footnotes omitted). \nUpon information and belief, the Government’s case against Hasbajrami will \nbe  based  primarily  upon  the  communications  initially  derived  as  a  result  of \nwarrantless  FAA  surveillance  (e.g.,  the  emails  described  above)  as  well  as  the \ndefendant’s post-arrest statements.  Although the Government will argue that the \nemails (and any other information not yet disclosed) were later obtained (or re-\nobtained) pursuant to Title I or Title III surveillance under FISA, the Government \nwill be unable to avoid the conclusion that its FISA warrants were the derivate fruit \nof warrantless FAA surveillance. \nAs such, upon information and belief, all of the evidence against Hasbajrami \nwill be shown to have been derived through warrantless surveillance, and it appears \nthat  none  of  it  would  have  been  inevitably  discovered  had  the  warrantless \nsurveillance never occurred.  What, if any, evidence survives the instant motions \nwill then determine whether there exists sufficient admissible evidence to sustain \n  4\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 23 of 131 PageID #: 639\n \nthe charges against Hasbajrami. \nIII.  Suppression Motions \nFirst Motion \nMOTION  TO  SUPPRESS  THE  FRUITS  OF  FAA \nSURVEILLANCE  DUE  TO  THE  PER  SE \nUNCONSTITUTIONALITY  OF  THE  STATUTE \nAND ITS APPLICATION HEREIN       \n \n  A.  Introduction \nOn February 24, 2014, the Government provided notice that it intended – and \npresumably still intends – “to offer into evidence or otherwise use or disclose in \nproceedings in the above-captioned matter information derived from acquisition of \nforeign  intelligence  information  conducted  pursuant  to  the  Foreign  Intelligence \nSurveillance Act of 1978, as amended, 50 U.S.C. § 1881a [i.e., the FAA]” (Gov’t \nletter [ecf #65] at 1).   \nMoreover, as explained by the Government, the “evidence and information, \nobtained  or  derived  from  Title  I  or  III  FISA  collection,  that  the  government \nintend[s] to offer into evidence or otherwise use or disclose in proceedings in this \ncase was derived from acquisition of foreign intelligence information conducted \npursuant to the FAA.” Id.   \nAs a result, Hasbajrami is an “aggrieved person” within the plain meaning of \nFISA and the FAA.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1801(k) (“ ‘Aggrieved person’ means a person \nwho  is  the  target  of  an  electronic  surveillance  or  any  other  person  whose \n  5\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 24 of 131 PageID #: 640\n \ncommunications or activities were subject to electronic surveillance.”). \n50 U.S.C. § 1881a, which is also known as Section 702 of FISA, was enacted \nin 2008 as part of the FISA Amendments Act (the FAA).  Section 702, which is the \nelement of the FAA referred to herein when we refer to the FAA, is viewed by \nmany commentators, academics, and others, as an unprecedented degradation of the \nprivacy rights of Americans, both U.S. citizens and U.S. lawful permanent residents, \nwith  none  of  the  protections  that  the  Fourth  Amendment  requires  to  limit \ngovernmental intrusions on privacy.   \nThe statute violates the Fourth Amendment and is therefore unconstitutional \nbecause it: \n  fails to provide judicial review of specific instances of searches and \nseizures  of  the  personal  communications  of  U.S.  persons  (i.e.,  U.S. \ncitizens and U.S. lawful permanent residents, all of whom possess the \nsame rights under the Fourth Amendment); \n \n  fails  to  require  probable  cause,  or  any level  of  suspicion,  before  \nthe  Government  can  search,  seize,  retain,  and  later  access  those \ncommunications; \n \n  fails to require specificity regarding the individual targeted by – or the \nfacility to be accessed during – the electronic surveillance; \n \n  limits the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court’s authority to insist \nupon,  and  eliminates  its  authority  to  supervise,  instance-specific \nprivacy-intrusion minimization procedures; and \n \n  fails  to  provide  any  accountability  regarding  the  Government’s \nsurveillance of the electronic communications of U.S. persons while at \nthe  same  time  exceeding  traditional  constitutional  and  statutory \n  6\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 25 of 131 PageID #: 641\n \nboundaries. \n \nThe  following  chart,  initially  created  earlier  this  year  by  the  Federal \nDefenders Office for its post-trial motions in United States v. Mohamed, 10 Cr. 475 \n(KI)  (D.Oregon),  demonstrates  how  the  FAA  differs  from  other  electronic \nsurveillance statutes – traditional FISA and Title III wiretaps – in terms of what \ninformation must be presented to a neutral and detached judicial officer in order to \nobtain authorization to execute specific search and seizures: \n  Title III  Traditional FISA  FAA \nRequired level of  Probable cause the  Probable cause the   \nsuspicion of an  individual is  individual is a foreign  None \nindividual  committing, has  power (including terrorist \ncommitted, or is  organizations) or an agent of \nabout to commit a  a foreign power.

See \n50 U.S.C. § 1805(c)(1)(C). \n \nAs  will  be  discussed  in  further  detail  below,  because  the  FAA  does  not \nprovide sufficient Fourth Amendment protections to the private communications of \nU.S. persons the statute is unconstitutional.  Consequently, and for the reasons that \nfollow, we respectfully submit that the fruits of all warrantless FAA surveillance \nmust be suppressed in this case and thus precluded from being introduced against \nHasbajrami at trial. \nThis  includes,  inter  alia:  the  following  categories  of  evidence  and \ninformation: \n  all evidence and information derived as a result of Title VII warrantless \nFAA surveillance; \n  \n  all evidence and information “obtained or derived from Title I and Title \nIII  FISA  collection  …    [that  was]  itself  also  derived  from  other \n  8\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 27 of 131 PageID #: 643\n \ncollection pursuant to Title VII” of the FAA (Gov’t letter [ecf #65] at \n1); \n  \n  Hasbajrami’s custodial statements;  \n \n  and any other evidence and information that the Government could not \nhave obtained in this case through an independent source, see Nardone \nv. United States, 308 U.S. 338, 341 (1939).   \n \nAs  such,  and  for  the  reasons  that  follow,  we  respectfully  submit  that \nsuppression is warranted under the Fourth Amendment as fruit of the poisonous \ntree.  See Murray v. United States, 487 U.S. 533, 536-37 (1988); see also 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1806(g) (“If the United States district court … determines that the surveillance \nwas  not  lawfully  authorized  or  conducted,  it  shall,  in  accordance  with  the \nrequirements  of  law,  suppress  the  evidence  which  was  unlawfully  obtained  or \nderived from electronic surveillance….”).  \nB.  Background of Warrantless FAA Surveillance \n \nCongress  enacted  FISA  in  1978  in  response  to  outcries  over  unlawful \nwarrantless intrusions on the privacy of American citizens conducted in the name of \nnational  security.  See  Kris  &  Wilson,  NATIONAL  SECURITY \nINVESTIGATIONS & PROSECUTIONS, § 2:7 (2d ed. 2012).  Congress found \nthat  the  Government,  in  the  name  of  national  security,  had  “violated  specific \nstatutory prohibitions,” “infringed the constitutional rights of American citizens,” \nand “intentionally disregarded” legal limitations on surveillance, including pursuing \n“a ‘vacuum cleaner’ approach to intelligence collection” that sometimes intercepted \n  9\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 28 of 131 PageID #: 644\n \nthe content of Americans’ communications under the pretext of targeting foreigners. \nFinal Report of the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations \nwith Respect to Intelligence Activities, Book II, S.Rep.No. 94-755, at 137, 165 \n(1976),  available  at  <http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/pdfs94th/94755_II.pdf> \n(last accessed, November 24, 2014).  While protecting the public was a central \nconcern,  the  purpose  of  FISA  was  to  rein  in  extra-legal  activities  by  bringing \nGovernmental surveillance within the rule of law. \nIn addition, the Supreme Court, in United States v. U.S. Dist. Court for the E. \nDist. of Mich., 407 U.S. 297, 313 (1972) (hereinafter, “Keith”) ruled that domestic \nnational security wiretapping was governed by the Fourth Amendment, and that as a \nresult a warrant was required.  The Court specifically left open the question of \nforeign intelligence information, and FISA represented an effort to codify the means \nfor collecting foreign intelligence information within the United States. \nIn 2008, the FAA radically increased the Government’s ability to search and \nseize the private electronic communications of U.S. citizens and all those protected \nby  the  Fourth  Amendment.    While  FISA  itself  represented  an  innovation  with \nrespect to the concepts of probable cause and electronic eavesdropping warrants \nremoving the requirement of probable cause of criminal activity and dispensing with \nmany of other substantive and procedural requirements present in Title III, the FAA \nextended  the  distance  from  traditional  Fourth  Amendment  warrant  requirements \n  10\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 29 of 131 PageID #: 645\n \nsignificantly further. \nFor  example,  the  FAA  allows  the  Government  to  target  any  “non-U.S. \nperson” – which includes “any group, entity, association, corporation, or foreign \npower” (50 U.S.C. § 1801[m]) – that is located overseas so long as a “significant” \npurpose  of  that  interception  is  related  to  foreign  intelligence,  which  is  broadly \ndefined.    See  50  U.S.C.  §  1801(e).    Thus,  the  statute  authorizes  wholesale \nsurveillance against “non-U.S. persons” but even those broad parameters do not \npermit  the  targeting  of  “U.S  persons”,  i.e.,  U.S.  citizens  and  lawful  permanent \nresidents such as Hasbjarami, nor the interception of any communication to or from \n– in all or part – United States soil, which was also the case here. \nNonetheless,  the  FAA  electronic  surveillance  program  results  in  massive \nacquisition of individual telephone calls and emails with no individualized judicial \nsupervision to limit or police the Government’s ability to thereafter review all such \nintercepted communications, regardless of whether the intercepted individual is a \nU.S. or non-U.S. person.  A recently declassified Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt (“FISC”) opinion from 2011 estimated that, in a single year, the programs \nimplementing the FAA acquired more than 250 million communications.  See [Case \nName Redacted], [docket number redacted], 2011 WL 10945618, at *9 (FISC Oct. \n3, 2011) (Bates, J.).  Reportedly, the National Security Agency (“NSA”) makes a \ncopy of “nearly all cross-border text-based data,” scans the content of each message \n  11\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 30 of 131 PageID #: 646\n \nusing  its  chosen  keywords  or  “selectors,”  then  saves  any  communication  that \ncontains  a  match  for  further  analysis.    Charlie  Savage,  N.S.A.  Said  to  Search \nContent of Messages to and From U.S., N.Y. Times, Aug. 8, 2013. \nBy ostensibly targeting foreign (i.e., “non-U.S.”) persons, the Government \nnonetheless searches and seizes the private communications of “U.S. persons” – \nboth U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents – in contact with those foreign \npersons without complying with basic Fourth Amendment protections.  Similarly, \nthe  seizure  of  communications  of  U.S.  persons  is  by  no  means  accidental  or \nunexpected.  Although the Government often describes the collection of American \ncommunications  as  “inadvertent”  and  “incidental,”  such  ignores  what  any \nreasonable  individual  with  knowledge  of  the  surveillance  could  foresee:  the \nintrusions  on  U.S.  persons  are  as  inevitable  and  expected  as  the  Government’s \nprotestations to the contrary.1 \n                                                 \n1   Cf. [Case Name Redacted], 2011 WL 10945618, at *16 (“The government argues that an \nNSA analyst’s post-acquisition discovery that a particular Internet transaction contains a wholly \ndomestic  communication  should  retroactively  render  NSA’s  acquisition  of  that  transaction \n‘unintentional.’…. That argument is unavailing.  NSA’s collection devices are set to acquire \ntransactions that contain a reference to the targeted selector.  When the collection device acquires \nsuch a transaction, it is functioning precisely as it is intended, even when the transaction includes \na  wholly  domestic  communication.    The  language  of  the  statute  makes  clear  that  it  is  the \ngovernment’s intention at the time of acquisition that matters, and the government conceded as \nmuch at the hearing in this matter…. Accordingly, the Court finds that NSA intentionally acquires \nInternet transactions that reference a tasked selector through its upstream collection [a Section 702 \nsurveillance program] with the knowledge that there are tens of thousands of wholly domestic \ncommunications  contained  within  those  transactions.”)  (emphasis  in  original  and  citations \nomitted). \n  12\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 31 of 131 PageID #: 647\n \nC.   The  provisions  of  the  FAA  authorizing  warrantless \nsurveillance  and  interception  (i.e.,  Section  702)  are \nunconstitutional per se and as applied herein and as such \nrequire  suppression  of  all  evidence  that  was  derived  as  a \nresult                    \n \nThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution states, “The right of \nthe  people  to  be  secure  in  their  persons,  houses,  papers,  and  effects,  against \nunreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall \nissue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly \ndescribing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.”   \nThis fundamental Constitutional requirement imbues U.S. persons with the \nfreedom, security, and protection from warrantless surveillance and the collection of \nevidence  resulting  from  such  surveillance  absent:  (1)  a  neutral  judicial \ndetermination of probable cause; (2) based on a sworn affidavit; (3) particularizing \nthe place to be searched; and (4) particularizing the person or things to be seized.  \nSee Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U.S. 551, 554 (2004). \nSearches undertaken without a warrant, as was the case here, “are per se \nunreasonable under the Fourth Amendment – subject only to a few specifically \nestablished and well-delineated exceptions,” Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, \n357 (1967), none of which apply to this case. See also United States v. Verdugo-\nUrquidez,  494  U.S.  259,  264  (1990)  (“The  Fourth  Amendment  …  prohibits \n‘unreasonable searches and seizures’ whether or not the evidence is sought to be \n  13\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 32 of 131 PageID #: 648\n \nused in a criminal trial, and a violation of the Amendment is ‘fully accomplished’ at \nthe  time  of  an  unreasonable  governmental  intrusion.”),  citing,  United  States  v. \nCalandra, 414 U.S. 338, 354 (1974), United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 906 \n(1984).   \nNotwithstanding the enactment of the FAA, the warrantless mass collection, \nretention,  accessing,  dissemination,  and  use  of  the  contents  of  the  electronic \ncommunications  of  U.S.  persons  has  long  been  held  to  violate  the  Fourth \nAmendment.  See Keith., 407 U.S. at 313 (warrantless domestic surveillance for \nnational security purposes violates the Fourth Amendment); Berger v. New York, \n388 U.S. 41, 64 (1967) (statute that authorized electronic surveillance under judicial \nsupervision  violated  the  Fourth  Amendment  because  it  “permits  a  trespassory \ninvasion of the home or office, by general warrant, contrary to the command of the \nFourth Amendment”).   \nThe enactment of the FAA is not the first time Congress has sought to test the \nbounds of the Constitution, and it will surely not be the last, but we respectfully \nsubmit that in this case of first impression this Court should uphold the sanctity of \nthe Fourth Amendment and reject as unconstitutional the Congressional end-run \nattempted by the creation of the FAA. \nTo be clear, the FAA permits the widespread capture, retention, and later \nquerying, dissemination, and use of the communications of U.S. persons (i.e., U.S. \n  14\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 33 of 131 PageID #: 649\n \ncitizens  and  lawful  permanent  residents,  such  as  Hasbajrami)  both  outside  and \nwithin the United States under the guise of targeting foreign actors, but without any \nof the protections required by the Fourth Amendment for those, like Hasbajrami, \nthat reside in the United States and at all relevant times possess the rights bestowed \nupon them by the United States Constitution. \nIndeed, the intrusions in this case also implicate the separation of powers \ndoctrine, which inheres in the structure of checks and balances created by the first \nthree Articles of the Constitution: \nThe  Fourth  Amendment  contemplates  a  prior  judicial \njudgment, not the risk that executive discretion may be \nreasonably exercised. This judicial role accords with our \nbasic constitutional doctrine that individual freedoms will \nbest  be  preserved  through  a  separation  of  powers  and \ndivision  of  functions  among  the  different  branches  and \nlevels  of  Government.    The  independent  check  upon \nexecutive discretion is not satisfied, as the Government \nargues,  by  ‘extremely  limited’  post-surveillance  judicial \nreview.  Indeed,  post-surveillance  review  would  never \nreach  the  surveillances  which  failed  to  result  in \nprosecutions.  Prior  review  by  a  neutral  and  detached \nmagistrate is the time-tested means of effectuating Fourth \nAmendment rights. \n \nKeith, 407 U.S. at 317-18 (emphasis added) (footnotes and citations omitted). See \nalso Berger, 388 U.S. at 63 (“Few threats to liberty exist which are greater than that \nposed by the use of eavesdropping devices.”). \nUnder  well-established  Fourth  Amendment  law,  the  FAA  fails  to  meet \nConstitutional requirements for two primary reasons.  First, since FAA surveillance \n  15\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 34 of 131 PageID #: 650\n \nhas not been confined to the collection of foreign communications by foreign actors \nabroad,  the  FAA  is  subject  to  the  Warrants  Clause  of  the  Fourth  Amendment, \nwhich,  as  will  be  discussed,  contains  fundamental  requirements  that  FAA \nsurveillance fails to meet.  See, e.g. Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, \n454-55 (1971) (“[T]he most basic constitutional rule in this area is that ‘searches \nconducted  outside  the  judicial  process,  without  prior  approval  by  judge  or \nmagistrate, are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment…’ ”), quoting, \nKatz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 357 (1967); accord Arizona v. Gant, 556 U.S. \n332, 338 (2009).   \nAnd second, the warrantless searches and seizures in this case cannot pass \nconstitutional muster because the Government will be unable to establish one of the \n“jealously and carefully drawn” exceptions to the warrant requirement.  Georgia v. \nRandolph, 547 U.S. 103, 109 (2006), quoting, Jones v. United States, 357 U.S. 493, \n499 (1958). \nNotably, the contents of telephone calls and emails of U.S. persons are within \nthe core zone of privacy protected from government intrusion in the absence of a \nwarrant.  See United States v. Alderman, 394 U.S. 165, 177 (1969); United States v. \nKatz, 389 U.S. 347, 353 (1967).  Moreover, as has long been held, “the broad and \nunsuspected governmental incursions into conversational privacy which electronic \nsurveillance entails necessitate the application of Fourth Amendment safeguards.”  \n  16\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 35 of 131 PageID #: 651\n \nKeith, 407 U.S. at 313. \nIn United States v. Warshak, 631 F.3d 266, 285-86 (6th Cir. 2010), the Sixth \nCircuit concluded that email “is the technological scion of tangible mail” and that it \nwould “defy common sense to afford emails lesser Fourth Amendment protection.”  \nTo that end, Hasbajrami’s emails merit the same Fourth Amendment protection as \nany of his private communications. \nIndeed, electronic surveillance requires compliance with the “basic command \nof the Fourth Amendment before the innermost secrets of one’s home or office are \ninvaded.” Berger, 388 U.S. at 63.  Just as letters and packages in the mail are treated \nas  Fourth  Amendment  papers  within  the  home,  the  content  of  electronic \ncommunications  are  protected  against  having  police  officers  read  them  in  the \nabsence of a warrant: \nLetters and sealed packages of this kind in the mail are as \nfully guarded from examination and inspection, except as \nto their outward form and weight, as if they were retained \nby  the  parties  forwarding  them  in  their  own  domiciles. \nThe constitutional guaranty of the right of the people to be \nsecure in their papers against unreasonable searches and \nseizure  extends  to  their  papers,  thus  closed  against \ninspection, wherever they may be.  Whilst in the mail, \nthey can only be opened and examined under like warrant, \nissued  upon  similar  oath  or  affirmation,  particularly \ndescribing  the  thing  to  be  seized,  as  is  required  when \npapers are subjected to search in one’s own household. \n \nWalter v. United States, 447 U.S. 649, 655 (1980).   \nImportantly,  the  Fourth  Amendment  applies  to  international  as  well  as \n  17\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 36 of 131 PageID #: 652\n \ndomestic  communications.  See  United  States  v.  Ramsey,  431  U.S.  606,  616-20 \n(1977); United States v. Peterson, 812 F.2d 486, 490-92 (9th Cir. 1987).  The Fourth \nAmendment also applies beyond criminal investigations because it “guarantees the \nprivacy, dignity, and security of persons against certain arbitrary and invasive acts \nby officers of the Government,” Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives’ Assn., 489 \nU.S.  602,  613-14  (1989),  “without  regard  to  whether  the  government  actor  is \ninvestigating crime or performing another function,” City of Ontario v. Quon, 130 \nS.Ct. 2619, 2630 (2010), including protecting national security, see Keith, 407 U.S. \nat 313-14. \nThe Fourth Amendment presupposes a number of measures that are missing \nfrom the search and seizure of electronic communications under the FAA: (1) a \nwarrant  authorizing  the  search  and  seizure;  (2)  based  upon  probable  cause;  (3) \nparticularly describing the place to be searched and the items to be seized; (4) based \nat all times on an affidavit under oath or affirmation; (5) issued by a neutral and \ndetached  magistrate  operating  in  a  judicial  capacity;  (6)  with  a  return  or  other \nprocedure assuring compliance with the terms of the warrant in its execution.  \nThe  absence  of  any  one  of  these  critical  features  from  FAA  surveillance \nwould be fatal to the statute because it would not adequately protect against the \nsearch and seizure of the private communications of persons who reasonably should \nbe  known  to  be  U.S.  persons.    See,  e.g.,  [Case  Name  Redacted],  2011  WL \n  18\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 37 of 131 PageID #: 653\n \n10945618, at *16 (holding that the “NSA knows with certainty that the upstream \ncollection,  viewed  as  a  whole,  results  in  the  acquisition  of  wholly  domestic \ncommunications”).   \nThat  none  of  them  are  present  in  the  FAA  compounds  the  statute’s \nunconstitutionality immeasurably.  The absence of these factors, either individually \nor collectively, violates the Fourth Amendment, and as such this Court should hold \nthat  the  Government’s  warrantless  collection,  retention,  and  accessing  are \npresumptively  unreasonable  under  Coolidge  and  Gant,  or,  at  a  minimum, \nunreasonable as applied to the facts of this case. \n1.  The  FAA  is  unconstitutional  per  se  and  as  applied \nherein  because  it  authorizes  surveillance  and \ninterception without a warrant         \n \nThe “warrant” of the Warrant Clause is distinct from the “authorization” and \n“certificate” by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) under 50 U.S.C. \n§§ 1881a(a), 1881a(g).   \nThe  issuance  of  a  search  warrant  by  a  judge  involves  an  individualized \ndetermination regarding the constitutionality of a specific invasion of privacy: \nIn response to these abuses of power by the government, \nthe  Founders  abolished  general  warrants,  restricted  the \ngovernment’s  ability  to  search  without  warrants,  and \nrequired  individual  authorization  of  specific  warrants.  \nToday,  search  warrants  are  specific  instruments  that \nrestrict government, dictate who may conduct a search, \nwhat  may  be  searched,  and  when  it  may  be  searched.  \nBoth  the  procurement  of  the  search  warrant  and  its \n  19\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 38 of 131 PageID #: 654\n \nexecution  must  be  done  under  the  law;  otherwise  the \nsearch  is  an  unconstitutional  abuse  of  governmental \npower. \n \nSwate v. Taylor, 12 F. Supp. 2d 591, 594 (S.D. Tex. 1998); see also United States v. \nVilar, 530 F.Supp.2d 616, 630 (SDNY 2008) (“Subpoenas are not search warrants.  \nThey involve different levels of intrusion on a person’s privacy.”), quoting, In re \nGrand Jury Subpoenas Dated Dec. 10, 1987, 926 F.2d 847, 854 (9th Cir. 1991) (also \nexplaining that “the person served [with a subpoena] determines whether he will \nsurrender  the  items  identified  in  the  subpoena  or  challenge  the  validity  of  the \nsubpoena prior to compliance,” whereas “[t]he person to be searched has no lawful \nway to prevent the execution of the warrant” prior to its enforcement).  In contrast, \nsimilar  to  a  subpoena,  the  FAA  only  calls  for  an  “authorization”  that  does  not \ninvolve any of the specificity of a Fourth Amendment warrant.   \n  Pursuant to 1881a(c)(2), the “authorization” requires “[a] determination … by \nthe  Attorney  General  and  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence  that  exigent \ncircumstances exist because, without immediate implementation of an authorization \n… intelligence important to national security of the United States may be lost or not \ntimely  acquired  and  time  does  not  permit  the  issuance  of  an  order  pursuant  to \nsubjection (i)(3) prior to the implementation of such authorization.”2   \n                                                 \n2   Section  1881a(i)(3)  discusses  the  judicial  review  of  certifications  and  procedures \nspecifically  with  respect  to  “orders”  issued  in  accordance  with  the  statute,  but  provides  no \nreference to warrants. \n  20\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 39 of 131 PageID #: 655\n \nHowever, the “certification” upon which all elements of FAA surveillance are \npredicated merely requires: (1) that the target of the surveillance “be located outside \nof the United States” and “attest” that the procedures sought to be utilized will \n“prevent the intentional acquisition of any communication as to which the sender \nand all intended recipients are known at the time of the acquisition to be located \noutside of the United States”; (2) that minimization procedures will be utilized; (3) \nthat  “a  significant  purpose  of  the  acquisition  is  to  obtain  foreign  intelligence \ninformation”; and (4) that other elements of the statute are followed.   \nHowever, nowhere does the FAA require that such certification establish the \nexistence of “probable cause” or any other threshold level of proof.  As a result, the \ncertification requires barely more detail then would be required in support of a so-\nordered subpoena, which is a far cry short of matching the quantum of evidence \nrequired for a warrant.  See Dalia v. United States, 441 U.S. 238, 256 n.18 (1979) \n(“electronic surveillance undeniably is a Fourth Amendment intrusion requiring a \nwarrant);  United  States  v.  Figueroa,  757  F.2d  466,  471  (2d  Cir.  1985)  (“even \nnarrowly circumscribed electronic surveillance must have prior judicial sanction”) \n(emphasis added).   \nAs  such,  we  respectfully  submit  that  a  statute  authorizing  the  massive \ncollection of – and access to – communications, without an individualized neutral \ndetermination that the electronic communications of U.S. persons can be seized, and \n  21\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 40 of 131 PageID #: 656\n \nread, secretly, and without consent, by Government agents, is in no way consistent \nwith the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement. \n2.  The  FAA  is  unconstitutional  per  se  and  as  applied \nherein because it permits surveillance and interception \nwithout probable cause            \n \nThe  Fourth  Amendment’s  requirement  of  “probable  cause”  assures  that \n“baseless searches shall not proceed.”  Keith, supra, 407 U.S. 297, 316 (1972).  This \nfundamental  norm  for  Government  searches  and  seizures  requires  sworn  facts \nsufficient  for  a  judge  to  decide  whether  individualized  suspicion  justifies  the \nGovernment’s intrusion on privacy.  See Gates v. Illinois, 462 U.S. 213, 239 (1983) \n(“An affidavit must provide the magistrate with a substantial basis for determining \nthe  existence  of  probable  cause,  which  is  not  met  by  wholly  conclusory \nstatements.”).    The  Supreme  Court  has  carefully  guarded  the  probable  cause \nstandard against encroachment within core areas of privacy; even a minor intrusion \nbeyond  the  boundary  of  the  lawful  Government  action,  where  core  rights  are \nconcerned,  requires  probable  cause.    See  Arizona  v.  Hicks,  480  U.S.  321,  329 \n(1987). \nIn  contrast,  the  FAA  fails  to  require  individualized  suspicion  or  probable \ncause before engaging in electronic surveillance.  Instead, the statute allows the \nGovernment to target any “persons reasonably believed to be located outside the \nUnited States to acquire foreign intelligence information,” 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(a), \n  22\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 41 of 131 PageID #: 657\n \nwith  the  definition  of  “person”  broadly  defined  to  include  “any  group,  entity, \nassociation,  corporation,  or  foreign  power,”  50  U.S.C.  §  1801(m).    While  the \nForeign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court  (hereinafter,  “FISC”)  approves  general \nprograms and procedures under the FAA, it does not, contrary to the requirements \nof the Fourth Amendment, review or approve the Government’s specific targeting \ndecisions nor its later access and querying of any seized communications.   \nGiven the broad definition of “person”, see 50 U.S.C. § 1801(m), and the \nminimal requirement that the electronic surveillance have as “a significant purpose” \nthe  acquisition  of  foreign  intelligence,  see  50  U.S.C.  §  1881a(g)(2)(A)(v),  the \nstatute broadly authorizes the Government to target entire geographical areas or \ngroups of people.  Thus, without court approval, the FAA could be relied upon to \nauthorize  the  Government  to  intercept  and  read  every  communication  to  and/or \nwithin a country of interest – Afghanistan or Pakistan, for example – as long as the \nGovernment satisfies itself that such intercepts implicate foreign intelligence – even \nif the communications (in writing, orally, or by electronic or other means) originate \nwithin the United States and are created by U.S. persons, both of which are the case \nhere. \nFor centuries leading up to and following the ratification of the Bill of Rights, \nthe probable cause standard has been the fundamental bulwark protecting people \nfrom  Governmental  over-reaching  into  their  private  lives.    See  Carlo  v.  United \n  23\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 42 of 131 PageID #: 658\n \nStates, 286 F.2d 841, 843 (2d Cir. 1961) (describing the Warrant Clause as “one of \nthe most fundamental and significant of the provisions of the Bill of Rights,” and \nexplaining that when warrantless searches are conducted the Court “must scrutinize \nthe  evidence  with  meticulous  care  to  make  sure  that  no  determination  …  shall \nconstitute any watering down or erosion of the rights guaranteed by the Fourth \nAmendment”);  cf.  Kyllo  v.  United  States,  533  U.S.  27,  34  (2001)  (requiring  a \nwarrant  for  use  of  a  thermal  imaging  device  outside  the  home  because  “[t]o \nwithdraw  protection  of  this  minimum  expectation  would  be  to  permit  police \ntechnology to erode the privacy guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment”). \nWe respectfully submit that the Government’s surveillance and interception \nof electronic communications of U.S. persons is constitutional only if based on a \njudicial finding of probable cause – that’s not merely the law, but also the just \nresult.  Under the FAA, no probable cause or other level of suspicion is required \nbefore communications are acquired, retained, and read, and as such we submit that \nthe statute unquestionably violates the Fourth Amendment. \n3.  The  FAA  is  unconstitutional  per  se  and  as  applied \nherein  because  it  permits  generalized  and \nprogrammatic acquisition, retention, and accessing of \nelectronic  communications  of  U.S.  persons  without \nrequiring  particularity  regarding  the  places  to  be \nsearched and the items to be seized         \n \n“The Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment categorically prohibits the \nissuance of any warrant except one ‘particularly describing the place to be searched \n  24\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 43 of 131 PageID #: 659\n \nand the persons or things to be seized.’ ” Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U.S. 79, 84 \n(1987).  “The manifest purpose of this particularity requirement was to prevent \ngeneral searches.  By limiting the authorization to search to the specific areas and \nthings for which there is probable cause to search, the requirement endures that the \nsearch  will  be  carefully  tailored  to  its  justifications,  and  will  not  take  on  the \ncharacter  of  the  wide-ranging  exploratory  searches  the  Framers  intended  to \nprohibit.”  Garrison, 480 U.S. at 84, citing, inter alia, Marron v. United States, 275 \nU.S. 192, 196 (1927).  \nAs one court put it, wholesale seizure of documents is exactly “the kind of \ninvestigatory dragnet that the Fourth Amendment was designed to prevent.” United \nStates v. Tamura, 694 F.2d 591, 595 (9th Cir. 1982).  Instead, the purpose of the \nspecificity requirement is to prevent general exploratory rummaging in a person’s \nbelongings. See Coolidge, 403 U.S. at 467.  “As to what is to be taken, nothing is \nleft to the discretion of the officer executing the warrant.” Marron, 275 U.S. at 196. \nIndeed, as recently explained by the Supreme Court in Riley v. California, \n134 S.Ct. 2473, 2494 (2014), the American colonists’ viscerally negative reaction to \nthe British practices of “general warrants” and “writs of assistance” provided an \nessential impetus for the Fourth Amendment, and even the American Revolution \nitself.  For centuries now:  \nOur  cases  have  recognized  that  the  Fourth  Amendment \nwas  the  founding  generation’s  response  to  the  reviled \n  25\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 44 of 131 PageID #: 660\n \n“general  warrants”  and  “writs  of  assistance”  of  the \ncolonial era, which allowed British officers to rummage \nthrough homes in an unrestrained search for evidence of \ncriminal activity.  Opposition to such searches was in fact \none of the driving forces behind the Revolution itself.  In \n1761, the patriot James Otis delivered a speech in Boston \ndenouncing the use of writs of assistance.  A young John \nAdams was there, and he would later write that “[e]very \nman of a crowded audience appeared to me to go away, as \nI did, ready to take arms against writs of assistance.”  10 \nWorks  of  John  Adams  247–248  (C.  Adams  ed.  1856).  \nAccording to Adams, Otis’s speech was “the first scene of \nthe first act of opposition to the arbitrary claims of Great \nBritain.    Then  and  there  the  child  Independence  was \nborn.” Id., at 248 (quoted in Boyd v. United States, 116 \nU.S. 616, 625 [] (1886)).  \n \nRiley, 134 S.Ct. at 2494. \nNotwithstanding the clear mandates of the Fourth Amendment, and similar to \nthe electronic surveillance statute held unconstitutional in Berger v. New York, \nsupra, 388 U.S. 41, 56 (1967), the FAA “lays down no requirement for particularity \nin the warrant as to what specific crime has been or is being committed, nor ‘the \nplace to be searched,’ or ‘the persons or things to be seized.’ ”   \nTo  the  contrary,  the  FAA  specifically  removed  from  FISA  the  previous \nspecific requirement of particularity as to the facilities to be targeted.  See 50 U.S.C. \n§  1881a(g)(4)  (“A  certification  made  under  this  subsection  is  not  required  to \nidentify the specific facilities, places, premises, or property at which an acquisition \nauthorized under subsection (a) will be directed or conducted.”). \n  26\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 45 of 131 PageID #: 661\n \nBy doing so, the FAA created an exception to FISA that is incompatible with \nthe Fourth Amendment.  See United States v. George, 975 F.2d 72, 76 (2d Cir. \n1992) (“a failure to describe the items to be seized with as much particularity as the \ncircumstances reasonably allow offends the Fourth Amendment because there is no \nassurance that the permitted invasion of a suspect’s privacy and property are no \nmore than absolutely necessary”). \nAnalogous to the interception of email that occurred in this case, last year the \nSecond Circuit held, “Where … the property to be searched is a computer hard \ndrive,  the  particularity  requirement  assumes  even  greater  importance.”    United \nStates  v.  Galpin,  720  F.3d  436,  446  (2d  Cir.  2013).    The  Court  reached  this \nconclusion reasoning that “because there is currently no way to ascertain the content \nof  a  file  without  opening  it,”  there  is  a  “  ‘serious  risk  that  every  warrant  for \nelectronic  information  will  become,  in  effect,  a  general  warrant,  rendering  the \nFourth  Amendment  irrelevant.’  ”    Galpin,  720  F.3d  at  447,  citing  and  quoting, \nUnited States v. Comprehensive Drug Testing, Inc., 621 F.3d 1162, 1176 (9th Cir. \n2010).  “This threat,” the Second Circuit held, “demands a heightened sensitivity to \nthe particularity requirement in the context of digital searches.”  Galpin, 720 F.2d at \n447.   \nCertainly,  there  is  no  meaningful  difference  between  the  contents  of  a \ncomputer hard drive versus the contents of an email account.  With the constant \n  27\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 46 of 131 PageID #: 662\n \nadvance of technology, both may be essentially limitless in size and content, and as \nsuch, “[t]he potential for privacy violations occasioned by an unbridled, exploratory \nsearch of [either] is enormous.”  Id.   \nHere, the FAA creates a mechanism that lacks any particularity of the places \nto be searched or the items to be seized; and contains no check on the Government’s \ncapacity  to  execute,  in  effect,  a  general  warrant  on  all  of  a  person’s \ncommunications;  no  check,  of  course,  except  for  the  Fourth  Amendment.    We \nrespectfully submit that this lack of particularity, particularly in the “heightened” \nrealm of digital searches, cannot survive the scrutiny that the Fourth Amendment \nrequires.  \n4.  The  FAA  is  also  per  se  unconstitutional  because  it \nincludes the participation of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance  Court  in  the  construction  of  its \nsurveillance programs, thereby blurring the role of the \nneutral and detached magistrate         \n \nThe Fourth Amendment requires the participation of a neutral and detached \nmagistrate to ensure that the Government does not overstep the Constitution while \nzealously attempting to “ferret[] out crime.” Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, \n14  (1948);  see  also  McDonald  v.  United  States,  335  U.S.  451,  455-56  (1948) \n(discussing the need for “an objective mind [to] weigh the need to invade” privacy \nto enforce the law); Steagald v United States, 451 U.S. 204, 212 (1981) (explaining \nthat judicial approval of warrants ensures a “checkpoint between the Government \n  28\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 47 of 131 PageID #: 663\n \nand the citizen”).   \nWhen the role of the judge is reduced merely to ratifying Executive Branch \ndecisions, and even participating in them as consultants (for all practical purposes), \nwith no case or controversy involving an adversary, the court’s input regarding the \nprogram morphs into an impermissible advisory opinion.  See Chafin v. Chafin, 133 \nS.Ct. 1017, 1023 (2013) (“Federal courts may not … give ‘opinion[s] advising what \nthe  law  would  be  upon  a  hypothetical  state  of  facts’  ”)  (brackets  in  original), \nquoting, Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 449 U.S. 472, 477 (1990); see also Lo-Ji \nSales, Inc. v. New York, 442 U.S. 319 (1979) (when magistrate participated in \nsearch, “the objective facts of record manifest an erosion of whatever neutral and \ndetached posture existed at the outset”); Coolidge, 403 U.S. at 449 (State Attorney \nGeneral who was actively in charge of criminal investigation and later was to be \nchief prosecutor at trial was per se disqualified from determining whether there was \nprobable cause to issue search warrants). \nGiven  the  programmatic  “approval”  process  performed  by  the  Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court under the FAA, the FISC no longer functions as \nneutral and detached judicial officers.  Rather, the statutory function of the court \nunder the FAA is not to issue a warrant based on probable cause but to authorize \nand certify a program.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(a).   \nIn doing so, the FISC meets ex parte with the Government and assists in \n  29\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 48 of 131 PageID #: 664\n \nformulating the program.  See [Case Name Redacted], 2011 WL 10945618, at *1-3; \nsee also id. at *1, *28-*30 (holding that one aspect of the Section 702 collection \nproposed therein, the “ ‘upstream collection’ of Internet transcriptions containing \nmultiple  communications[,]  is,  in  some  respects  deficient  on  statutory  and \nconstitutional  grounds,”  and  then  identifying  the  deficiencies  and  ordering  their \ncorrection or cessation if the corrections do not occur).   \nAs  such,  rather  than  approve  or  disapprove  of  proposals,  the  Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court has a role in designing and modifying them and \nadvising  how  the  programs  may  be  fashioned  in  order  to  comply  with  the \nrequirements of the Fourth Amendment when applied – exactly what the Supreme \nCourt has clearly prohibited.   \nGiven the blurred lines involved in FAA surveillance, we respectfully submit \nthat the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court does not operate, in the context of \nSection 702, as the neutral and detached magistrate required by the Warrant Clause \nof the Fourth Amendment.   \nD.  Conclusion \n  Defendant Agron Hasbajrami is a lawful permanent resident who at all times \nrelevant to this motion resided within the United States.  Each intercepted email was \neither  sent  or  received  by  Hasbajrami  while  Hasbajrami  was  within  the  United \nStates,  and  to  the  extent  any  telephone  calls  were  intercepted  that  included \n  30\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 49 of 131 PageID #: 665\n \nHasbajrami,  Hasbajrami’s  participation  in  those  calls  could  have  only  occurred \nwhile he was within the United States.   \nYet,  the  “authorization”  permitting  the  surveillance  and  interception  of \nHasbjarami’s  communications  was  issued  without  a  warrant,  without  a  prior \nshowing of probable cause, without requiring particularity regarding the places to be \nsearched or the items to be seized, and without the supervision of an entirely neutral \nand detached magistrate.   \nAccordingly, for these and all other reasons discussed above, the defense \nrespectfully submits that the FAA is both unconstitutional per se and as specifically \napplied against Hasbajrami.  As a result, the defense further submits that the fruits \nof all FAA surveillance that aggrieved Hasbajrami must be suppressed in this case. \nSecond Motion \nMOTION TO SUPPRESS THE FRUITS OF FAA \nSURVEILLANCE IRRESPECTIVE OF THE \nCONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE STATUTE \n \n  A.  Introduction \nAssuming  arguendo  that  the  FAA  survives  the  constitutional  challenges \nraised herein, see First Motion, supra, the statutory application of 50 U.S.C. § 1881a \nto  the  facts  of  this  case  also  requires  suppression  of  Hasbajrami’s  intercepted \ncommunications.    As  the  Court  noted  in  its  October  2,  2014,  Order  permitting \nHasbajrami to withdraw his guilty plea: \n  31\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 50 of 131 PageID #: 666\n \n[E]ven if Hasbajrami cannot make a facial challenge to the \nFAA, it is also possible that the revelation of the role FAA \nmaterial  played  in  the  government’s  investigation  will \nlead to new fact-specific challenges to the evidence that \nthe government would have used in this case.  Hasbajrami \nmight seek to suppress the FISA-obtained evidence not \nbecause  the  FAA  is  unconstitutional  in  general,  but \nbecause of some other infirmity in its application to this \nparticular case.  \n \nOrder, dated, October 2, 2014 (ecf #85), at 8.  The instant motion addresses these \nstatutory concerns. \n  Indeed, a fundamental rule of statutory construction is that a statute should be \nconstrued in a manner that preserves its constitutionality.  See United States ex rel. \nAttorney General, v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U.S. 366, 408 (1909) (when “a \nstatute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful \nconstitutional questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided, \n[a court’s] duty is to adopt the latter”); see also Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. \n227, 239-40 (1999); accord Triestman v. United States, 124 F.3d 361, 377 (2d Cir. \n1997); United States v. Al-Arian, 329 F. Supp.2d 1294, 1298 & n. 11 (M.D. Fla. \n2004)  (relative  to  §  2339B);  United  States  v.  Khan,  309  F.Supp.2d  789,  822 \n(E.D.Va. 2004) (applying the same principle to “personnel” in the context of 18 \nU.S.C. § 2339A).   That doctrine of “constitutional avoidance” therefore requires \nthis Court to examine the application of 50 U.S.C. § 1881a to Hasbajrami in order to \ndetermine whether a purely statutory basis exists for suppression, thereby obviating \n  32\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 51 of 131 PageID #: 667\n \nthe need to decide the constitutional issues presented in the First Motion. \n  Here,  while  defense  counsel  (and  Hasbajrami)  have  thus  far  been  denied \naccess to specific information that would verify a statutory violation of 50 U.S.C. § \n1881a  in  this  case,  as  discussed  below,  abundant  public  information  exists  to \nestablish that during the very period in which Hasbajrami’s communications were \nintercepted  (April  2,  2011,  through  August  28,  2011),3  and  during  which  he,  a \n“United States person,” was located exclusively within the U.S., the NSA routinely \nexceeded the authority granted it by the FISC and violated 50 U.S.C. § 1881a as a \nmatter of course.   \nWe  address  in  Defendant’s  Fifth  Motion,  infra,  why  such  indisputable \nevidence  of  the  general  nature  of  the  NSA’s  violations  of  the  FAA  requires \ndisclosure to cleared defense counsel of materials and information specific to the \nelectronic surveillance of Hasbajrami, or, at an absolute minimum, exacting scrutiny \nby this Court in camera.  In the meantime, and absence of such discovery, the \nfollowing motion outlines the violations of the FAA that we believe mostly likely \noccurred in this case.  As such, we respectfully request that this Court weigh the \ninstant arguments when reviewing any ex parte submissions provided to this Court \nby the Government, as well as when considering, based upon the public record, \n                                                 \n3    Defense  counsel  does  not  know  the  precise  period  during  which  such  interceptions \noccurred (which may be longer), but refer to that which is public from the information provided in \nthe Pre-Sentence Report.  See Section II, supra. \n  33\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 52 of 131 PageID #: 668\n \nwhether Hasbajrami’s rights under the FAA were violated in this case. \nB.  The  requirements  and  limitations set forth in 50 U.S.C. § \n1881a of the FAA                \n \n  1.   Background of the § 1881a program \n  As noted ante, in POINT I, the FAA was enacted in 2008.  However, for \nseven years prior to the passage of the FAA, NSA had been conducting (at least) the \nvery  same  electronic  surveillance  and  interception  ultimately  authorized  by  the \nFAA.    For  example,  “in  2001,  the  NSA  []  began  acquiring  Internet-based \ncommunications of overseas targets without the use of a traditional law enforcement \nwarrant or an electronic surveillance order under Title I of FISA.”  Edward C. Liu, \nAndrew Nolan, Richard M. Thompson II, Overview of Constitutional Challenges to \nNSA  Collection  Activities  and  Recent  Developments,  Congressional  Research \nService  (April  1,  2014)  (hereinafter,  “CRS  Report:    Overview”),  at  9  (footnote \nomitted) available at <http://fas.org/sgp/crs/intel/R43459.pdf>, citing, December 20, \n2013, Unclassified Declaration of Frances J. Flesch, National Security Agency, in \nSchubert  v.  Obama,  07  Civ.  693  (JSW)  (N.D.Cal.),  at  ¶  32  (available  at \n<http://icontherecord.tumblr.com>). \n  Initially,  such  surveillance  and  interception,  denominated  the  Terrorist \nSurveillance Program (hereinafter “TSP”), was performed without any legislative or \ncourt authorization.  See James Risen & Eric Lichtblau, “Bush Let U.S. Spy on \nCallers  Without  Courts,”  N.Y.  Times,  December  16,  2005  (available  at \n  34\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 53 of 131 PageID #: 669\n \n<http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html?_r=0>).    After  the \nTSP’s existence was disclosed in December 2005 in N.Y. Times, “[u]timately, new \nstatutory authority for this type of acquisition was provided, at first, temporarily \nunder the Protect America Act (‘PAA’) of 2007 [P.L. 110-55], and on a longer term \nbasis by the FISA Amendments Act (‘FAA’) [P.L. 261].”  CRS Report: Overview, \nat 10 (footnotes omitted). \n  The scope of the surveillance and interception has been breathtaking.  The \nCRS Report: Overview noted: \nAccording to a partially declassified 2011 opinion from \nthe  FISC,  NSA  collected  250  million  Internet \ncommunications per year under this program.  Of these \ncommunications,  91%  were  acquired  “directly  from \nInternet  Service  Providers,”  referred  to  as  “PRISM \ncollection.”  The other 9% were acquired through what \nNSA  calls  “upstream  collection,”  meaning  acquisition \nwhile  Internet  traffic  is  in  transit  from  one  unspecified \nlocation to another. \n \nCRS Report:  Overview, at 10 (footnotes omitted), citing, In re Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court (Redacted), Docket No. [Redacted], 2011 WL 10945618, at *9, \n*25 (FISC 2011). \n  In  addition,  as  the  CRS  Report:  Overview,  again  citing  the  2011  FISC \nopinion, explains that: \n[The]  NSA  also  has  two  methods  for  collecting \ninformation  about  a  specific  target:  “to/from” \ncommunications  collection,  in  which  the  target  is  the \nsender  or  receiver  of  the  Internet  communications;  and \n  35\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 54 of 131 PageID #: 670\n \n“about” communications collection, in which the target is \nonly mentioned in communications between non-targets.  \n \nId.  (footnotes  omitted),  citing,  In  re  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court \n(Redacted), 2011 WL 10945618, at *5. \n  Moreover,  according  to  the  CRS  Report:  Overview,  “The  Obama \nAdministration  also  acknowledged  to  the  FISC  that  technical  limitations  in  the \n‘upstream’  collection  result  in  the  collection  of  some  communications  that  are \nunrelated to the target or that may take place entirely between persons located in the \nUnited States.”  Id., at 10 (footnote omitted).4 \n  2.   The FAA’s specific requirements and limitations \n  While the FAA codified the legal authority of the U.S. Attorney General and \nthe  Director  of  National  Intelligence  (hereinafter  “DNI”)  to  authorize  jointly \n(through a certification process submitted to the FISC) the targeting of non-U.S. \npersons  reasonably  believed  to  be  located  outside  the  United  States  (and,  once \nauthorized, to acquire such communications for up to one year), the statute also \n                                                 \n4    The CRS Report:  Overview, also explains: \n  \nThe  PRISM  and  upstream  collections  differ  from  the  telephony \nmetadata  program  in  two  key  respects.    First,  the  PRISM  and \nupstream collections acquire the contents of those communications.  \nSecond,  as  this  program  targets  the  “to/from”  and  “about” \ncommunications  of  foreigners  who  are  abroad,  the  collection  of \nInternet-based communications may be considered by some to be \nmore discriminating than the bulk collection of telephony metadata. \n \nCRS Report: Overview, at 10. \n  36\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 55 of 131 PageID #: 671\n \nimposed certain substantive and procedural restrictions upon electronic surveillance \nand interception pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § 1881a.   \n  Summarizing  those  limitations,  the  CRS  Report:  Overview  explained  that \nacquisition of communications pursuant to § 1881a: \n  may  not  intentionally  target  any  person  known  at  the  time  of \nacquisition  to  be  located  in  the  United  States,  see  50  U.S.C.  § \n1881a(b)(1); \n \n  may not intentionally target a person reasonably believed to be located \noutside the United States if the purpose of such acquisition is to target a \nparticular, known person reasonably believed to be in the United States \n(so-called “reverse targeting”), see 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(b)(2); \n \n  may not intentionally target a U.S. person reasonably believed to be \nlocated outside the United States, see 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(b)(3); and \n \n  may  not  intentionally  acquire  any  communication  as  to  which  the \nsender  and  all  intended  recipients  are  known  at  the  time  of  the \nacquisition  to  be  located  in  the  United  States,  see  50  U.S.C.  § \n1881a(b)(4). \n \nCRS Report: Overview, at 10-11.5 \n  Thus, as Judge Bates enumerated in his 2011 FISC opinion, 50 U.S.C. § \n1881a(d)(1) requires that “the targeting procedures must be ‘reasonably designed’ to \n‘ensure  that  any  acquisition  authorized  under  [the  certification]  is  limited  to \ntargeting persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States.’ ”  In \nre Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (Redacted), 2011 WL 10945618, at *5. \n                                                 \n5    The FAA also requires that electronic surveillance pursuant to § 1881a be conducted in a \nmanner  consistent  with  the  Fourth  Amendment.

Elaborating, Judge \nBates pointed out: \nMost  notably,  that  definition  requires  “specific \nprocedures,  which  shall  be  adopted  by  the  Attorney \nGeneral,  that  are  reasonably  designed  in  light  of  the \npurpose and technique of the particular [surveillance or \nphysical  search],  to  minimize  the  acquisition  and \nretention, and prohibit the dissemination, of nonpublicly \navailable  information  concerning  unconsenting  United \nStates  persons  consistent  with  the  need  of  the  United \nStates  to  obtain,  produce,  and  disseminate  foreign \nintelligence information.”  \n \nIn re Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (Redacted), 2011 WL 10945618, at \n*5, quoting, 50 U.S.C. §§1801(h) & 1821(4).  \n  The mechanics of authorization pursuant to § 1881a require the Attorney \nGeneral and the DNI to make certain certifications with respect to the limitations \nbuilt into § 1881a.  As a result, the Attorney General and DNI must submit to the \nFISC an application for a “mass acquisition order,” see 50 U.S.C. §§ 1881a(a), \n1881a(c)(2), with “a written certification and supporting affidavit” attesting that the \n  38\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 57 of 131 PageID #: 673\n \nFISC has approved, or that the Government has submitted to the FISC for approval, \n“targeting procedures” reasonably designed to (1)  ensure that the acquisition is \n“limited to targeting persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United \nStates,” and (2)  “prevent the intentional acquisition of any communication as to \nwhich the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time of the acquisition \nto be located in the United States.”  50 U.S.C. § 1881a(g)(2)(A)(i).  \n  The certification and supporting affidavit must also attest that the FISC has \napproved,  or  that  the  Government  has  submitted  to  the  FISC  for  approval, \nminimization  procedures  that  meet  the  definition  of  “minimization  procedures” \nunder 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(h) or 1821(4).  The certification and supporting affidavit \nmust  also  attest,  among  other  things,  that  the  Attorney  General  has  adopted \n“guidelines”  to  ensure:  compliance  with  the  limitations  set  out  in  50  U.S.C.  § \n1881a(b); that the targeting procedures, minimization procedures, and guidelines are \nconsistent  with  the  Fourth  Amendment;  and  that  “a  significant  purpose  of  the \nacquisition  is  to  obtain  foreign  intelligence  information.”    50  U.C.C.  § \n1881a(g)(2)(A)(iii)-(vii). \n  However, in addition to the distinctions in the concept of “probable cause” – \nparticularly  the  fact  that  individual  targets  of  surveillance  are  not  necessarily \nreviewed  by  the  FISC  prior  to  acquisition  of  their  communications  –  between \ntraditional  FISA  warrants  and  §  1881a  surveillance  and  acquisition,  the  FISC’s \n  39\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 58 of 131 PageID #: 674\n \noversight  role  with  respect  to  the  latter  is  “narrowly  circumscribed.”    In  re \nProceedings Required by § 702(i) of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, Docket \nNo. Misc. 08-01, 2008 WL 9487946, at *2 (FISC Aug. 27, 2008) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). \n  Instead, the FISC’s role is essentially limited to reviewing the targeting and \nminimization procedures that the Government proposes to use to target and acquire \ncommunications  prospectively.    See  CRS  Report:  Overview,  at  11  (footnote \nomitted).  The FISC must also find that the minimization procedures are reasonably \ndesigned to minimize the retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of information \nthat  is  about  a  U.S.  person  or  that  could  identify  a  U.S.  person.    Id.  (footnote \nomitted),  citing,  50  U.S.C.  §  1881a(e).    However,  the  minimization  procedures \nallow for the retention and dissemination of information – including U.S. person \ninformation, – that is evidence of a crime.  Id. \n  Another limiting element that applies to FISA generally, and, it is respectfully \nsubmitted, applies to electronic surveillance and interception pursuant to the FAA as \nwell, appears in 50 U.S.C. § 1805(a)(2)(A), which provides “that no United States \nperson may be considered a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power … solely \nupon the basis of activities protected by the first amendment….”   \n  Accordingly, if the target participated in First Amendment activities such as \nexpressing  support,  urging  others  to  express  support,  gathering  information, \n  40\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 59 of 131 PageID #: 675\n \ndistributing information, raising money for political causes, or donating money for \npolitical causes, 50 U.S.C. § 1805(a)(2)(A) would preclude those activities from \nserving as the basis for FAA surveillance. \nC.   The  implications  of  non-disclosure  of  the  underlying  FAA \napplications, affidavits, certifications and orders regarding \nthe electronic surveillance of Hasbajrami        \n \n1.   The vertical playing field created by ex parte FISA and \nFAA proceedings              \n \n  Litigation  of  FISA-authorized  electronic  surveillance  generally,  and  FAA-\nauthorized  electronic  surveillance  in  particular  in  this  case,  represents  a  radical \ndeparture from the traditional and essential requirement of the adversary process.6  \nWhile ordinary search and even electronic surveillance warrants (issued pursuant to \nTitle III) are presented initially ex parte, once criminal charges are instituted defense \ncounsel and the defendant are afforded access to the underlying submissions in \nsupport of those warrants.  On the other hand, with only one exception known to \ndefense  counsel,  FISA  and  FAA  applications  (and  supporting  documents)  have \n                                                 \n6    As  stated  in  the  Congressional  Research  Service’s  Report,  Reform  of  the  Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Courts:  Introducing a Public Advocate:  \n \nAn underlying principle of the Anglo-American legal system is the \nadversarial process, whereby attorneys gather and present evidence \nto  a  generally  passive  and  neutral  decision  maker.    The  basic \nassumption of the adversarial system is that a “sharp clash of proofs \npresented” by opposing advocates allows a neutral judge to best \nresolve difficult legal and factual questions. \n \nAndrew Nolan, Richard M. Thompson II, and Vivian S. Chu, Reform of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Courts: Introducing a Public Advocate, Congressional Research Service, March 21, \n2014, at 2 (available at <http://fas.org/sgp/crs/intel/R43260.pdf>). \n  41\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 60 of 131 PageID #: 676\n \nnever been shared with the defendant or defense counsel – even defense counsel in \npossession of the requisite security clearance to review classified material.  See \nUnited States v. Daoud, Docket No. 12 Cr. 723, 2014 WL 321384 (N.D.Ill. January \n29, 2014), rev’d, 755 F.3d. 479 (7th Cir. 2014). \n  The entirely one-sided nature of FISA litigation, particularly in the context of \ndetermining  whether  the  Government  adhered  to  the  restrictions  set  forth  in  50 \nU.S.C. § 1881a, applies not only to the facts at issue, as only the Government knows \nthe facts specific to the FAA electronic surveillance and interception with respect to \nHasbajrami, but also to the law as well, as the Government has access to the entire \nbody of FISC and FISCR opinions while defense counsel’s access is limited to \nthose few opinions the Government or the court has released publicly. \n  This  decidedly  unlevel  playing  field  –  indeed,  it  is  vertical,  with  the \nGovernment at the apex and defense counsel at the bottom – has clear implications, \nnot the least of which is the Government’s undefeated (and unsurprising, in light of \nthe  advantages  inherent  in  ex  parte  litigation)  record  in  FISA  litigation  in  the \nstatute’s 35-year history.  Also, it imposes upon this Court a responsibility – review \nof the FISA or FAA submissions as, in effect, surrogate defense counsel – to which \ncourts have acknowledged they are not sufficiently suited to fulfill.  See Alderman \nv. United States, 394 U.S. 65, 184 (1969); Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 169 \n(1978); United States v. Marzook, 412 F. Supp.2d 913, 921 (N.D.Ill. 2006). \n  42\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 61 of 131 PageID #: 677\n \n  Here,  declassified  opinions  of  the  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court \nhave provided evidence of systemic non-compliance with the court’s authorizations. \nIn the absence of the disclosure of the classified material requested in Defendant’s \nFifth Motion, infra, which we submit is necessary for defense counsel to present a \nfull and complete picture of the Government’s violations of its obligations under the \nFAA, Hasbajrami’s burden of establishing specific statutory non-compliance should \nbe relaxed accordingly.   \nAs such, we respectfully submit that the Government should shoulder the \nburden of proving compliance – indeed, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor makes \nsense here under the circumstances the Government alone has created.  Certainly in \nthis context, in which the FISC’s approval was based on a general application, and \nnot on specific information related to Hasbajrami, it would be appropriate to judge \nthe Government on its lack of general compliance with the FISC’s authorization. \n2.   Criticism of the FISC’s ability to perform its necessary \noversight function             \n \n  Compounding the problem of ex parte review of FISA and FAA materials \nonce a criminal prosecution is commenced is the fact that the FISC’s capacity for \noversight of FAA electronic surveillance and acquisition at the initial application \nphase is so narrowly defined by statute, as well as the FISC’s historical institutional \nlimitations as an independent factor in reining in abuse of FISA and FAA authority. \n  Regarding  the  latter,  unlike  the  judiciary’s  traditional  threshold  Fourth \n  43\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 62 of 131 PageID #: 678\n \nAmendment role as a gatekeeper for particular acts of surveillance, the FISC’s role \nin FAA electronic surveillance is simply to ratify in advance the vaguest parameters \npursuant  to  which  the  Government  is  then  free  to  conduct  acquisition  of \ncommunications for up to one year.  \n  Nor,  unlike  courts  discharging  their  requisite  Fourth  Amendment \nresponsibilities,  does  the  FISC  consider  individualized  and  particularized \nsurveillance applications, or make individualized probable cause determinations, or \nsupervise  the  implementation  of  the  Government’s  targeting  or  minimization \nprocedures.7 \n  Consequently,  in  the  wake  of  the  disclosures  of  the  NSA’s  vast  and \nunprecedented dragnet approach to electronic surveillance, the FISC has been the \nsubject of much criticism and reconsideration.8  As the Congressional Research \n                                                 \n7   Nor are judicial rulings from the FISC precedential, as they have not been issued in the \ncontext of “Cases” or “Controversies” within the constitutional meaning of Article III because \nonly one party was involved.  See Camreta v. Greene, 131 S. Ct. 2020, 2028 (2011) (authority to \nadjudicate legal disputes requires adverse litigants with the “concrete adverseness which sharpens \nthe presentation of issues”), quoting, Los Angeles v.

Critics  of  the  current  FISA \nproceedings  have  cited  the  infrequency  of  the  FISC’s \nrejections of government surveillance request as evidence \nthat the lack of an adversarial process has prevented the \ncourt  from  fully  and  properly  scrutinizing  the \ngovernment’s  position.    While  some  reject  this  line  of \nreasoning, those who have found the ex parte nature of \nFISA  proceedings  troubling  have  argued  that  allowing \nanother attorney to argue in opposition to the requests of \nthe  Department  of  Justice  (DOJ)  to  conduct  foreign \nintelligence activity would allow the FISC to better protect \ncivil liberty interests. \n \n                                                                                                                                                               \nwhich FISC and [the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review] perform the function \nthey were envisioned to serve”);  Stephen I.

The  history  of  non-compliance  with  both  FAA  and  FISA \nrestrictions                  \n \n  Certainly the public record compels a presumption that during the time period \nat issue herein – 2010-2011 – NSA was not in compliance with FAA or FISA in a \nnumber of critical and relevant aspects.  Following the disclosures made by Edward \nSnowden, in August 2013 the Government released declassified versions of a series \nof  FISC  opinions  that  catalog  the  abuses  and  transgressions  –  exceeding  the \nauthority granted by the FISC – NSA committed in the course of implementing \nFAA programs and surveillance/acquisition. \n  In  one  such  FISC  opinion,  In  re  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court \n(Redacted), supra, 2011 WL 10945618, at *5, n.14 (FISC 2011), District Judge John \nD. Bates, Chief Judge of the FISC at the time, excoriated the NSA for exceeding its \nacquisition authority and making repeated misrepresentations to the FISC regarding \nthe NSA’s activities during the period in which Hasbajrami’s communications were \nmonitored and intercepted pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § 1881a.  As described in the CRS \nReport:  Overview,  Judge  Bates  was  evaluating  “the  targeting  and  minimization \nprocedures proposed by the government to address new information regarding the \nscope of upstream collection.”  CRS Report: Overview, at 13 (footnotes omitted). \n  The  CRS  Report:  Overview  explained  that  “the  government  had  recently \ndiscovered  that  its  upstream  collection  activities  had  acquired  unrelated \ninternational communications as well as wholly domestic communications due to \n  47\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 66 of 131 PageID #: 682\n \ntechnological limitations.”  Id. (footnotes omitted).  In response, Judge Bates “found \nthe proposed minimization procedures to be deficient on statutory and constitutional \ngrounds.”  Id. (footnotes omitted). \n  According to the CRS Report: Overview,  \n[w]ith  respect  to  the  statutory  requirements,  the  FISC \nnoted  that  the  government’s  proposed  minimization \nprocedures  were  focused  “almost  exclusively”  on \ninformation that an analyst wished to use and not on the \nlarger  set  of  information  that  had  been  acquired. \nConsequently,  communications  that  were  known  to  be \nunrelated to a target, including those that were potentially \nwholly domestic, could be retained for up to five years so \nlong  as  the  government  was  not  seeking  to  use  that \ninformation. \n \nId. (footnote omitted). \n  The CRS Report: Overview noted that Judge Bates concluded that “this had \nthe effect of maximizing the retention of such information, and was not consistent \nwith FISA’s mandate to minimize the retention of U.S. person information.”  Id. \n(footnote omitted). \n  In  his  opinion,  and  discussed  in  POINT  I,  supra,  Judge  Bates  noted  the \npervasive nature of the violations: “The court is troubled that the government’s \nrevelations  regarding  NSA’s  acquisition  of  Internet  transactions  mark  the  third \ninstance in less than three years in which the government has disclosed a substantial \nmisrepresentation regarding the scope of a major collection program.”  In re Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court (Redacted), 2011 WL 10945618, at *5, n.14. \n  48\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 67 of 131 PageID #: 683\n \n  Judge  Bates  further  noted  that  the  Government’s  submissions  in  that \nproceeding made it clear that the NSA had been acquiring Internet transactions even \nbefore the FISC’s first approval thereof, id. at *17, n.45, adding that: \n  “[t]he  Court’s  review  of  the  targeting  and  minimization  procedures \nsubmitted  with  the  April  2011  Submissions  is  complicated  by  the \ngovernment's  recent  revelation  that  NSA’s  acquisition  of  Internet \ncommunications through its upstream collection under Section 702 is \naccomplished by acquiring Internet ‘transactions,’ which may contain a \nsingle, discrete communication, or multiple discrete communications, \nincluding communications that are neither to, from, nor about targeted \nfacilities, June 1 Submission at 1–2.  That revelation fundamentally \nalters  the  Court’s  understanding  of  the  scope  of  the  collection \nconducted pursuant to Section 702 and requires careful reexamination \nof  many  of  the  assessments  and  presumptions  underlying  its  prior \napprovals.”  Id. at *5; \n \n  “for the first time, the government has now advised the Court that the \nvolume  and  nature  of  the  information  it  has  been  collecting  is \nfundamentally different than what the Court had been led to believe.”  \nId. at 9; \n \n  “the Court is also unable to find that NSA’s targeting and minimization \nprocedures,  as  the  government  proposes  to  implement  them  in \nconnection  with  MCT’s  [multi-communication  transactions],  are \nconsistent with the Fourth Amendment.”  Id. at 9; \n \n  “NSA’s minimization procedures, as the government proposes to apply \nthem to MCT’s as to which the ‘active user’ is not known to be a \ntasked selector, do not meet the requirements of 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(e) \nwith respect to retention[.]” Id. at 28; \n \n  “[t]he  sheer  volume  of  transactions  acquired  by  NSA  through  its \nupstream collection is such that any meaningful review of the entire \nbody of transactions is not feasible.”  Id. at 10; \n \n  “the  Court  cannot  know  for  certain  the  exact  number  of  wholly \n  49\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 68 of 131 PageID #: 684\n \ndomestic communications acquired through this collection, nor can it \nknow the number of non-target communications acquired or the extent \nto which those communications are to or from United States persons or \npersons in the United States.”  Id. at 10; \n \n  “[e]ven if the Court accepts the validity of conclusions derived from \nstatistical analyses, there are significant hurdles in assessing NSA’s \nupstream collection . . . it is impossible to define with any specificity \nthe universe of transactions that will be acquired by NSA’s upstream \ncollection at any point in the future.”  Id. at 10; \n \n  “the actual number of wholly domestic communications acquired may \nstill be higher in view of NSA’s inability conclusively to determine \nwhether a significant portion of the MCT’s within its sample contained \nwholly domestic communications.”  Id. at 11; and \n \n  “the  record  shows  that  the  government  knowingly  acquires  tens  of \nthousands of wholly domestic communications each year.”  Id. at 15.10 \n \n  As a result, Judge Bates required further briefing by the Government because \n“it appeared to the Court that the acquisitions described in [a recent Government \nletter to the Court] exceeded the scope of collection previously disclosed by the \ngovernment and approved by the Court, and might, in part, fall outside the scope of \nSection 702.”  Id. at *2. \n  Subsequently,  the  Government  presented  the  FISC  revised  minimization \nstandards  that  were  deemed  acceptable  under  statutory  and  Fourth  Amendment \nstandards.  However, those modifications were submitted November 30, 2011, well \n                                                 \n10    See also Charlie Savage, “N.S.A.

That opinion, by FISC Judge Reggie B. \nWalton (who also sits as a District Judge in the District for the District of Columbia) \nprovides further and compelling proof that NSA persistently lies to, conceals from, \nand misleads (affirmatively and by silence) the FISC, that NSA cannot be trusted \neven to train its own employees adequately, or even be able to determine for itself \nthe limits on its surveillance activities consistent with statute or FISC Orders.  See \nIn re Production of Tangible Things From [Redacted], Docket No. BR 08-13, 2009 \nWL 9150913 (FISC March 2, 2009). \n  Judge  Walton’s  FISC  opinion  demonstrates  the  plethora  of  statutory \n  52\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 71 of 131 PageID #: 687\n \nviolations that pervade the NSA’s electronic surveillance programs, including those \nat issue herein.  For example, Judge Walton’s March 2009 FISC opinion includes \nthe following passages: \n  “[t]he government’s submission suggests that its non-compliance with \nthe Court’s orders resulted from a belief by some personnel within the \nNSA  that  some  of  the  Court’s  restrictions  on  access  to  the  BR \n[Business Records] metadata applied only to “archived data”.… That \ninterpretation strains credulity … such an illogical interpretation of the \nCourt’s  Orders  renders  compliance  with  the  RAS  [Reasonable, \nArticulable Suspicion] requirement merely optional.”  Id. at *2; \n \n  “[t]he government compounded its non-compliance with the Court’s \norders by repeatedly submitting inaccurate descriptions of the alert list \nprocess to the FISC.”  Id. at *3; \n \n  “[r]egardless  of  what  factors  contributed  to  making  these \nmisrepresentations,  the  Court  finds  that  the  government’s  failure  to \nensure that responsible officials adequately understood the NSA’s alert \nlist process, and to accurately report its implementation to the Court, \nhas prevented, for more than two years, both the government and the \nFISC from taking steps to remedy daily violations of the minimization \nprocedures  set  forth  in  FISC  orders  and  designed  to  protect \n[REDACTED]  call  detail  records  pertaining  to  telephone \ncommunications of US persons located within the United States who \nare  not  the  subject  of  any  FBI  investigation  and  whose  call  detail \ninformation could not otherwise have been legally captured in bulk.”  \nId. at *4; \n \n  “[i]n summary, since January 15, 2009, it has finally come to light that \nthe FISC’s authorizations of this vast collection program have been \npremised on a flawed depiction of how the NSA uses BR metadata.  \nThis  misperception  by  the  FISC  existed  from  the  inception  of  its \nauthorized collection in May 2006, buttressed by repeated inaccurate \nstatements  made  in  the  government’s  submissions,  and  despite  a \ngovernment-devised  and  Court-mandated  oversight  regime.    The \nminimization  procedures  proposed  by  the  government  in  each \n  53\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 72 of 131 PageID #: 688\n \nsuccessive application and approved and adopted as binding by the \norders of the FISC have been so frequently and systematically violated \nthat it can fairly be said that this critical element of the overall BR \nregime has never functioned effectively.”  Id. at *5 (emphasis added); \n \n  “[t]he  record  before  the  Court  strongly  suggests  that,  from  the \ninception  of  this  FISA  BR  program,  the  NSA’s  data  accessing \ntechnologies and practices were never adequately designed to comply \nwith the governing minimization procedures.”  Id. at *7; and \n \n  “[u]nder these circumstances, no one inside or outside of the NSA can \nrepresent with adequate certainty whether the NSA is complying with \nthose procedures.  In fact, the government acknowledges that, as of \nAugust  2006,  “there  was  no  single  person  who  had  a  complete \nunderstanding  of  the  BR  FISA  system  architecture.”    Id.  at  *7 \n(emphasis added).  See also Scott Shane, “Court Upbraided N.S.A. on \nIts Use of Call-Log Data,” N.Y. Times, September 10, 2013, available \nat  <http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/11/us/court-upbraided-nsa-on-\nits-use-of-call-log-data.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0>  (noting  that, \naccording to a senior U.S. intelligence official who briefed reporters \njust prior to release of the 2009 FISC opinion, “only about 10 percent \nof 17,800 phone numbers on the alert list in 2009 had met [the RAS] \ntest,” and that “[t]here was nobody at N.S.A. who really had a full \nunderstanding of how the program was operating at the time”). \n \n  Judge Walton also recognized the FISC’s limitations as a watchdog, pointing \nout that “in light of the scale of this bulk collection program, the Court must rely \nheavily on the Government to monitor this program to ensure that it continues to be \njustified, in the view of those responsible for our national security, and that it is \nbeing implemented in a manner that protects the privacy interests of US persons as \nrequired by applicable minimization procedures.”  Id. at *6.   \n  Elaborating, Judge Walton noted that “[t]o approve such a program, the Court \nmust have every confidence that the government is doing its utmost to ensure that \n  54\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 73 of 131 PageID #: 689\n \nthose responsible for implementation fully comply with the Court’s orders.”  Id.  \nYet, he concluded, “The Court no longer has such confidence.”  Id. \n  Judge Walton’s lack of confidence was well-founded, and validated by the \nNSA’s continued non-compliance.  As if Judge Bates’s 2011 FISC opinion and \nJudge  Walton’s  2009  FISC  opinion  (and  the  three  others  cited  above)  were \ninsufficient to demonstrate NSA’s abject inability – whether deliberate or simply \nthrough inexcusably irresponsible negligence or cavalier incompetence – to comply, \na  subsequent  August  13,  2009,  report  the  Government  submitted  to  the  FISC \nrevealed even more non-compliance issues beyond the myriad enumerated in Judge \nWalton’s opinion, and which were discovered after issuance of that Opinion.  See \nReport  of  the  United  States,  In  Re  Application  of  the  Federal  Bureau  of \nInvestigation for an Order Requiring the Production of Tangible Things, Docket \nNo. BR 09-09, August 13, 2009, (hereinafter “US Report, Docket BR 09-09\"). \n  Further violations of the FISC’s Orders included, for example: (a) permitting \nemployees of other government agencies to have external and unsupervised access \nto the NSA database; (b) failing to audit for compliance issues – at any point over \nthe lifespan of the program – a database used to store information retrieved from \nNSA databases; and (c) use of software with a feature permitting analysts to pull \nmore information than NSA was authorized to retrieve.  Id. \n  The NSA’s continued non-compliance and recidivism, even through 2011 as \n  55\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 74 of 131 PageID #: 690\n \ndescribed in Judge Bates’s FISC opinion, establishes that the FISC’s complaints, \nand even its attempts at remedial measures, are ineffectual as long as the process \nremains secret.  The public record – and who knows (certainly not defense counsel) \nwhat still remains classified – compels but one conclusion:  the NSA cannot be \ntrusted to comply with its statutory and constitutional obligations, despite repeated \nchances, and one of the principal reasons is the absence of any accountability.  \n  The repeated misrepresentations cited by Judge Bates in October 2011 and \nJudge Walton in 2009 constitute simply a constant and continued feature of NSA \npractice with respect to FISA surveillance generally.  Indeed, they are reminiscent \nof those divulged in the FISC’s 2002 opinion in In re All Matters Submitted to the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court, 218 F.Supp.2d 611, 620-21 (FISC), rev’d \non other grounds sub nom., In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d 717 (FISCR 2002),11 in \nwhich the FISC, in its first opinion ever, reported that beginning in March 2000, the \nDepartment  of  Justice  had  come  “forward  to  confess  error  in  some  75  FISA \napplications related to major terrorist attacks directed against the United States.” \n  Those  errors  related  to  misstatements  and  omissions  of  material  facts,” \nincluding: \n  “75 FISA applications related to major terrorist attacks directed against \nthe United States” contained “misstatements and omissions of material \n                                                 \n11    “FISCR” refers to the Foreign Intelligence Court of Review, which is the appellate court \nfor the FISC, and is comprised of three Federal Circuit judges.  The FISCR’s 2002 decision in In \nre Sealed Case marked its first case since enactment of FISA in 1978. \n  56\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 75 of 131 PageID #: 691\n \nfacts.”  In  re  All  Matters  Submitted  to  the  Foreign  Intelligence \nSurveillance Court, 218 F.Supp.2d at 620-21; \n \n  the government’s failure to apprise the FISC of the existence and/or \nstatus of criminal investigations of the target(s) of FISA surveillance. \nId.; and \n \n  improper contacts between criminal and intelligence investigators with \nrespect to certain FISA applications. Id. \n \n  According to the FISC, “In March of 2001, the government reported similar \nmisstatements  in  another  series  of  FISA  applications.…”    Id.  at  621.    Those \nproblems, however, were not isolated or resolved by those revelations.  Instead, they \nproved persistent.  A report issued March 8, 2006, by the DOJ Inspector General \nstated  that  the  FBI  found  apparent  violations  of  its  own  wiretapping  and  other \nintelligence-gathering procedures more than 100 times in the preceding two years, \nand problems appear to have grown more frequent in some crucial respects.  See \nReport to Congress on Implementation of Section 1001 of the USA PATRIOT Act, \nMarch  8,  2006  (hereinafter  “DOJ  IG  Report”)  (available  at \n<http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/s0603/final.pdf>).   \n  The report characterized some violations as “significant,” including wiretaps \nthat were much broader in scope than authorized by a court (“over-collection”), and \nothers that continued for weeks and months longer than authorized (“overruns”).  Id. \n  57\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 76 of 131 PageID #: 692\n \nat 24-25.12  FISA-related over-collection violations constituted 69% of the reported \nviolations in 2005, an increase from 48% in 2004.  See DOJ IG Report, at 29.  The \ntotal percentage of FISA-related violations rose from 71% to 78% from 2004 to \n2005, although the amount of time “over-collection” and “overruns” were permitted \nto continue before the violations were recognized or corrected decreased from 2004 \nto 2005.  Id. at 25, 29.  \n  The lack of veracity catalogued in the declassified FISC opinions publicly \ndisclosed is inevitable in a system in which there is no opponent to dispute facts or \nhold opponents accountable for misrepresenting facts, and in which the court lacks \ninvestigative authority or any practical, meaningful means of oversight over the \ncollection/storage/interception  process.    Indeed,  an  internal  May  2012  audit  of \nNSA’s surveillance programs – among the documents recently disclosed by Mr. \nSnowden  –  found  that  NSA  violated  privacy  rules  protecting  domestic  U.S. \ncommunications  2,776  times  in  a  one-year  period.    See  SID  Oversight  & \nCompliance, Quarterly Report, First Quarter Calendar Year 2012, May 3, 2012, \navailable  at  <http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/758651-1qcy12-\nviolations.html#document/p12>. \n                                                 \n12    The DOJ Inspector General’s report was not instigated by the Government itself.  Rather, \nthe publication of documents released to the Electronic Privacy Information Center (hereinafter \n“EPIC”) in Freedom of Information Act litigation prompted the DOJ IG to use those and other \ndocuments as a basis for the report.  In preparing the report the IG reviewed only those 108 \ninstances in which the FBI itself reported violations to the Intelligence Oversight Board – a four-\nmember Executive Branch body that ordinarily does not submit its reports to Congress. \n  58\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 77 of 131 PageID #: 693\n \n  Unfortunately, in a system in which NSA and other intelligence organs are \nfree to misrepresent without challenge or accountability, little has changed except \nperhaps NSA’s enhanced dexterity in abusing and manipulating the FISC and the \nFISA system as a whole. \n  Here, even on just the public record, the FISC opinions establish that  during \nthe time frame relevant to this case, when Hasbarajmi, undeniably a “U.S. person,” \nwas located exclusively in the United States, the NSA was regularly and materially \nviolating § 1881a and exceeding the authority granted it by the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court.   \nIn addition, the First Amendment limitations on FISA surveillance also merit \nconsideration, particularly since the conduct that led to the FISA surveillance could \nvery  well  have  been  limited  to  protected  First  Amendment  activity.    See \nHumanitarian  Law  Project  v.  Holder,  130  S.  Ct.  2705,  2710  (2010)  (material \nsupport does not include independent advocacy, or even mere membership in a \nproscribed organization).   \n  Judged by its general and wholly unsatisfactory level of non-compliance, the \nGovernment’s violation of 50 U.S.C. § 1881a in this case is manifest even from the \npublic  record  alone.    Consideration  of  such  non-compliance  would  be  an \nappropriate standard in this instance since the general program of surveillance and \nacquisition (rather than a particularized application specifically to Hasbajrami) is \n  59\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 78 of 131 PageID #: 694\n \nwhat the FISC approved, reviewed, and initially found incompatible with the FAA \n(and the Fourth Amendment) before ultimately approving modifications made after \nthe interception of Hasbajrami’s communications. \nMoreover, even the Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Court concluded that \nthe  Government’s  capture  of  domestic  U.S.  communications  –  during  the  time \nframe of the surveillance and acquisition of Hasbajrami’s communications – was \nintentional, and therefore beyond the boundaries set by the FISC and the FAA.  See \nIn  re  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court  (Redacted),  supra,  2011  WL \n10945618, at *16 (FISC 2011).   \nIn addition, as discussed in Defendant’s Fifth Motion, infra, the DNI has \ninformed a U.S. Senator that in at least one instance the minimization standards \nemployed by NSA were “unreasonable” under the Fourth Amendment, and that the \nagency believed “the government’s implementation of Section 702 of FISA has \nsometimes circumvented the spirit of the law, and on at least one occasion the FISA \nCourt has reached this same conclusion.”  Letter from the Office of the DNI to \nSenator  Ron  Wyden,  dated,  July  20,  2012,  available  at \n<http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/dangerroom/2012/07/2012-07-20-OLA-Ltr-\nto-Senator-Wyden-ref-Declassification-Request.pdf> (last accessed, November 23, \n2014). \n  60\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 79 of 131 PageID #: 695\n \nE.  Conclusion \nAccordingly, for all of the reasons discussed above, we respectfully submit \nthat  the  Government’s  electronic  surveillance  and  acquisition  of  Hasbajrami’s \nelectronic communications were conducted in violation of 50 U.S.C. § 1881a, and \nmust therefore be suppressed along with any and all of fruits derived therefrom. \nThird Motion \nMOTION  TO  SUPPRESS  THE  FRUITS  OF  FAA \nSURVEILLANCE  DUE  TO  OUTRAGEOUS \nGOVERNMENT CONDUCT          \n \nThis  Court  ruled  that  the  Government’s  intentional  decision  to  provide \nHasbajrami with “FISA notice without FAA notice,” notwithstanding the statutory \nrequirements  to  the  contrary  (i.e.,  50  U.S.C.  §  1881e[a]),  intentionally  “misled \n[Hasbajrami] about an important aspect of his case” (Order, dated, October 2, 2014 \n[ecf #85], at 6).  This Court then permitted Hasbajrami to withdraw his guilty plea \nas a result (id. at 7-8).   \nWhile the result fashioned by this Court permitted Hasbajrami to be returned \nprocedurally to the position he would have been in if not for the Government’s \nviolation of its notice obligations under the FAA, the defense respectfully submits \nthat additional sanctions are necessary to dissuade the Government from repeating \nits misconduct in future cases.  Specifically, the defense submits that suppression \n  61\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 80 of 131 PageID #: 696\n \nhere of the fruits of the Government’s warrantless FAA surveillance would satisfy \nthis goal. \nIn Hampton v. United States, 425 U.S. 484, 495 n.7 (1976), the Supreme \nCourt  ruled  that  Government  misconduct  could  invalidate  a  conviction  on  due \nprocess  grounds  if  the  misconduct  reaches  a  “demonstrable  level  of \noutrageousness.”    Similarly,  the  Second  Circuit  has  acknowledged  that \n“Government involvement in a crime may in theory become so excessive that it \nviolates due process and requires the dismissal of charges against a defendant even \nif the defendant was not entrapped.”  United States v. Al Kassar, 660 F.3d 108, 121 \n(2d Cir. 2011). \nBecause  the  sanction  of  dismissal  is  so  severe,  the  Second  Circuit  has \nobserved that outrageous Government conduct is “an issue frequently raised that \nseldom  succeeds.”    United  States  v.  Schmidt,  105  F.3d  82,  91  (2d  Cir.  1997).  \nHowever,  the  Court  has  also  made  clear  that  it  accepts  the  legal  principle  that \ngovernmental conduct can be so beyond the pale that it constitutes a Due Process \nviolation requiring sanction.  See United States v. Cromitie, 727 F.3d 194, 217-221 \n(2d Cir. 2013); Al Kassar, 660 F.3d at 121.   \nHere, while the Government’s misconduct might not warrant the ultimate \nsanction of dismissal, some meaningful sanction in nevertheless necessary to avoid \n  62\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 81 of 131 PageID #: 697\n \na toothless result that provides Hasbajrami no relief and leaves the Government \nunaccountable. \nAs this Court recognized in United States v. Simels, Docket No. 08 Cr. 640 \n(JG), 2009 WL 1924746, at *13-15 (EDNY July 2, 2009), in the context of the \nfailure to minimize interception of legitimate attorney-client conversations recorded \npursuant to a defective Title III electronic eavesdropping warrant, the wholesale \nfailure to minimize required wholesale suppression.  Further, as this Court also \nrecognized in Simels, there would be little incentive for the Government to act \nproperly in the future if, in the worst case scenario, after the failure to minimize was \ndiscovered,  only  the  improperly  intercepted  communications  –  which  the \nGovernment never had a right to collect – were suppressed.  That is, in tactical and \nstrategic terms, a “no lose” proposition for the prospective wrongdoer. \nHere, the Government’s misconduct was deliberate, calculating, and designed \nto mislead (by omitting reference to the FAA in its original FISA notice).  Failing to \nimpose  some  sanction  would  not  just  fail  to  punish  misconduct,  it  would, \nconversely, reward it.  \nHasbajrami has been allowed to withdraw his guilty plea and to therefore \nchallenge the warrantless surveillance that took place in this case.  However, by \nwithdrawing his guilty plea Hasbajrami faces the potential for a lengthier sentence \nnow than he had been facing prior to learning that the Government had violated his \n  63\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 82 of 131 PageID #: 698\n \nDue Process rights.  Specifically the defendant now faces a potential sentence of 60 \nyears  imprisonment  upon  a  conviction  post-trial,  whereas  he  had  previously \nreceived a 15-year sentence pursuant to his plea agreement.   \nAs such, should the defendant’s suppression motions fail, the Government \nwill be in a better position vis-à-vis Hasbajrami’s potential sentence then it would \nhave been in had Hasbajrami never learned of the Government’s misconduct in the \nfirst place.  Although this Court’s order fulfilled the good intention of returning the \ndefendant to the procedural position he was in prior to his guilty plea, this Court’s \norder also returned the Government to the unscathed – and advantageous – position \nit was in prior to unlawfully failing to comply with its notice obligations under the \nFAA. \nWe respectfully submit that a just result requires a more significant sanction \nthan  simply  returning  the  parties  to  the  position  they  had  been  in  prior  to  the \nGovernment’s  unlawful  action.    While  outright  dismissal  would  constitute  an \nextreme  sanction,  suppression  of  the  fruits  of  the  warrantless  surveillance  is \ncertainly appropriate and would make clear that when the Government willfully \nevades its discovery obligations significant consequences will follow. \nAs such, we respectfully submit that the Government’s intentional decision to \nmislead the defendant into entering a guilty plea by withholding information critical \nto his decision-making with respect to that plea, is so outrageous that it requires a \n  64\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 83 of 131 PageID #: 699\n \nsanction beyond simply permitting the defendant to withdraw his guilty plea.  We \nrespectfully  submit  that  it  requires  the  tempered  and  appropriate  sanction  of \nsuppression as well. \nFourth Motion \nMOTION  TO  SUPPRESS  HASBAJRAMI’S  POST-\nARREST STATEMENTS           \n \nOn  September  6,  2011,  Defendant  Agron  Hasbajrami  was  arrested, \nhandcuffed, and interrogated by the FBI.  The interrogation lasted for three days and \nwas not completed until September 8, 2011.  During that interrogation, Hasbajrami \nwaived his Miranda rights and made incriminating statements that the Government \nintends to introduce at trial.  See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 460-63 (1966).   \nNonetheless, because Hasbajrami’s arrest and statements were a direct result \nof the surveillance challenged in Motions One through Four, above, and because \nHasbajrami’s  arrest  and  statements  would  not  have  been  produced  through  an \nindependent  source,  to  the  extent  Hasbjarami’s  suppression  motions  were  not \nalready  clear,  we  hereby  also  specifically  move  to  suppress  his  post-arrest \nstatements as fruit of the poisonous tree.

Discovery Motions \nFifth Motion \nMOTION FOR DISCOVERY OF MATERIAL AND \nINFORMATION  NECESSARY  TO  DETERMINE \nWHETHER  THE  GOVERNMENT’S  SPECIFIC \nCONDUCT  IN  THIS  CASE  VIOLATED  THE \nSTATUTORY  REQUIREMENTS  OF  FISA,  THE \nFAA,  AND/OR  ANY  OTHER  SURVEILLANCE \nSTATUTE OR PROGRAM RELIED UPON DURING \nTHE INVESTIGATION OF THIS CASE, AS WELL \nAS  TO  DETERMINE  WHETHER  THE \nGOVERNMENT’S  SPECIFIC  CONDUCT \nVIOLATED  HASBAJRAMI’S  RIGHT  TO  DUE \nPROCESS UNDER THE FIFTH AMENDMENT   \n \nA.  Introduction \nAs previously stated, Hasbajrami is an “aggrieved person” within the plain \nmeaning of FISA and the FAA.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1801(k) (“ ‘Aggrieved person’ \nmeans a person who is the target of an electronic surveillance or any other person \nwhose communications or activities were subject to electronic surveillance.”). The \n“electronic surveillance” under “this subchapter” refers to subchapter I of the FISA, \nwhich is entitled “Electronic Surveillance” and codified at 50 U.S.C.§§ 1801-1812.  \nThe statute broadly defines electronic surveillance in 50 U.S.C. § 1801(f). \nAs also previously discussed, when evidence is “derived” from surveillance \nthat  was  “not  lawfully  authorized  or  conducted”  the  Court  must  suppress  the \nevidence, see 50 U.S.C. § 1806(g), and derivative evidence includes statements and \ntangible evidence that are the fruit of the poisonous tree, see Murray v. United \n  66\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 85 of 131 PageID #: 701\n \nStates, supra, 487 U.S. 533, 536-37 (1988).  \nAs such, so that the defense may effectively establish whether Hasbajrami has \nany further basis to challenge the Government’s surveillance programs in this case, \nthe defense requests from the Government – including all Federal, State, and local \nlaw  enforcement,  intelligence,  diplomatic,  military,  and  other  agencies  and \ndepartments, as well as from foreign governments with which the U.S. has acted \njointly or cooperatively in this investigation – the following pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § \n1881a, Rule 16 of the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C. § 3504,13 \nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and its progeny: \n1.  To the extent there exists any “foreign intelligence information” relevant \nto this case that has not been previously disclosed to the defense, provide \nany remaining undisclosed information at this time; \n \n2.  Disclose whether the FAA surveillance relied upon against Hasbajrami \nintentionally  targeted  the  defendant  (see  50  U.S.C.  §§  1881a[b][1], \n                                                 \n13   18 U.S.C. § 3504 provides, in relevant, part: \n \n(a) In any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, \ngrand jury, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, or other \nauthority  of  the  United  States  …  (1)  upon  a  claim  by  a  party \naggrieved that evidence is inadmissible because it is the primary \nproduct  of  an  unlawful  act  or  because  it  was  obtained  by  the \nexploitation of an unlawful act, the opponent of the claim shall \naffirm or deny the occurrence of the alleged unlawful act; \n \nX  X  X \n   \n(b)  As used in this section, “unlawful act” means any act the use of \nany electronic, mechanical, or other device (as defined in section \n2501[5] of this title) in violation of the Constitution or laws of the \nUnited States or any regulation or standard promulgated pursuant \nthereto. \n  67\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 86 of 131 PageID #: 702\n \n1881a[b][2]), and/or whether he was the subject of “reverse targeting” \n(i.e., targeting someone oversees in order to capture communications with \na U.S. person or in order to capture communications involving a U.S. \ncomponent); \n \n3.  Disclose whether the FAA surveillance relied upon against Hasbajrami \nintentionally targeted “a United States person reasonably believed to be \nlocated outside of the United States” (50 U.S.C. § 1881a[b][3]); \n \n4.  Disclose whether the FAA surveillance relied upon against Hasbajrami \n“intentionally acquire[d] any communication as to which the sender and \nall intended recipients [were] known at the time of the acquisition to be \nlocated in the United States” (50 U.S.C. § 1881a[b][4]); \n \n5.  Disclose whether the Government has any reason to believe that the FAA \nsurveillance  relied  upon  against  Hasbajrami  were  not  “conducted  in  a \nmanner consistent with the fourth amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States” (50 U.S.C. § 1881a[b][5]); \n \n6.  Provide copies of all FISA warrants and FISA warrant applications not \npreviously disclosed to the defense in this case; \n \n7.  Provide  material  documenting  what  minimization  and  targeting \nprocedures  and  interpretive  instructions  were  in  effect  at  the  time  any \nforeign intelligence evidence or information was gathered, and how those \nprocedures were implemented (i.e., who was being targeted, what was the \nbasis  for  that  targeting,  and  what  minimization  procedures  were  used \nduring that targeting); \n \n8.  Provide  what  information,  if  anything,  was  told  to  was  the  Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) about FAA surveillance relative to \nHasbajrami (or other persons relevant to this case) in approving any FISA \nwarrants in this case; \n \n9.  Provide notice of whether any other surveillance programs were relied \nupon during the investigation of this case and aggrieved Hasbajrami; and  \n \n10. Provide notice whether any “programmatic analytics” were utilized, or \nwhether cross-referencing or searching or analysis occurred with respect \nto  the  information  derived  from  FAA  and  FISA  surveillance  and \n  68\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 87 of 131 PageID #: 703\n \ninterception, and/or any other surveillance, interception, collection, and/or \nretention program. \n \nIt is requested that compliance with each of the above discovery demands be \nmade by providing the requested information directly to cleared defense counsel.  \nHowever,  should  the  Government  believe  that  cleared  defense  counsel  are \nprohibited from receiving any or all of the above information, then it is requested \nthat, at a minimum, the information be provided to this Court for in camera review \n(pursuant to the provisions of the Classified Information Procedures Act and any \nappropriate protective order), and that after such review this Court disclose to the \ndefense any such information that this Court determines the defense is entitled. \nB.  Disclosure will level the uneven vertical playing field created \nby ex parte FISA and FAA Proceedings         \n \n  As  discussed  in  Defendant’s  Second  Motion,  supra,  litigation  of  FISA-\nauthorized  electronic  surveillance  generally,  and  FAA-authorized  electronic \nsurveillance  in  particular  in  this  case,  represents  a  radical  departure  from  the \ntraditional and essential requirement of the adversary process.  The entirely one-\nsided nature of FISA litigation, can be evened however if this Court determines that \ndefense  input  will  assist  this  Court’s  review  of  the  FISA  and  FAA-related \ninformation.    See  50  U.S.C.  §  1806(f)  (authorizing  courts  to  “disclose  to  the \naggrieved  person,  under  appropriate  security  procedures  and  protective  orders, \nportions of the application, order, or other materials relating to the surveillance … \n  69\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 88 of 131 PageID #: 704\n \nwhere such disclosure is necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality \nof the surveillance”). \n  As the Supreme Court recognized in Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 65, \n184 (1969) – a case involving electronic surveillance – “[i]n our adversary system, \nit is enough for judges to judge.  The determination of what may be useful to the \ndefense  can  properly  and  effectively  be  made  only  by  an  advocate.”    See  also \nFranks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 169 (1978) (permitting adversarial proceeding on \nshowing of intentional falsehood in warrant affidavit because the magistrate who \napproves a warrant ex parte “has no acquaintance with the information that may \ncontradict the good faith and reasonable basis of the affiant’s allegations”).14 \n  Ex parte proceedings impair the integrity of the adversary process and the \ncriminal justice system.  As the Supreme Court has recognized, “[F]airness can \nrarely be obtained by secret, one-sided determination of facts decisive of rights…. \nNo better instrument has been devised for arriving at truth than to give a person in \njeopardy of serious loss notice of the case against him and opportunity to meet it.” \n                                                 \n14    As explained by the court in United States v. Marzook, a case also involving terrorism-\nrelated charges, and in the context of deciding whether to close a suppression hearing to the public \nbecause of the potential revelation of classified information thereat:   \n \nIt is a matter of conjecture whether the court performs any real \njudicial function when it reviews classified documents in camera.  \nWithout the illumination provided by adversarial challenge and with \nno expertness in the field of national security, the court has no basis \non which to test the accuracy of the government’s claims. \n \nUnited States v. Marzook, 412 F. Supp.2d 913, 921 (N.D.Ill. 2006), quoting, Stein v. Department \nof Justice & Federal Bureau of Investigation, 662 F.2d 1245, 1259 (7th Cir. 1981). \n  70\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 89 of 131 PageID #: 705\n \nUnited States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, et. al., 510 U.S. 43, at 55 (1993), \nquoting, Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 170-72 \n(1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring); see also United States v. Madori, 419 F.3d 159, \n171 (2d Cir. 2005), citing, United States v. Arroyo-Angulo, 580 F.2d 1137, 1145 \n(2d Cir. 1978) (closed proceedings “are fraught with the potential of abuse and, \nabsent compelling necessity, must be avoided”) (other citations omitted).15 \n  In  United  States  v.  Abuhamra,  389  F.3d  309  (2d  Cir.  2004),  the  Second \nCircuit reemphasized the importance of open, adversary proceedings, declaring that \n“[p]articularly where liberty is at stake, due process demands that the individual and \nthe  government  each  be  afforded  the  opportunity  not  only  to  advance  their \nrespective positions but to correct or contradict arguments or evidence offered by \nthe other.”  Abuhamra, 389 F.3d at 322-23, citing, McGrath, 341 U.S. at 171 n.17 \n(Frankfurter, J., concurring) (which noted that “the duty lying upon every one who \ndecides anything to act in good faith and fairly listen to both sides … always giving \na  fair  opportunity  to  those  who  are  parties  in  the  controversy  for  correcting  or \ncontradicting any relevant statement prejudicial to their view”) (citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted).16 \n                                                 \n15    Conversely, as Judge Learned Hand stated in United States v. Coplon, 185 F.2d 629, 638 \n(2d Cir. 1950), “Few weapons in the arsenal of freedom are more useful than the power to compel \na government to disclose the evidence on which is seeks to forfeit the liberty of its citizens.” \n \n16    As the Ninth Circuit observed in the closely analogous context of a secret evidence case, “ \n‘One  would  be  hard  pressed  to  design  a  procedure  more  likely  to  result  in  erroneous \n  71\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 90 of 131 PageID #: 706\n \n  Similarly,  in  the  Fourth  Amendment  context,  including  in  relationship  to \nelectronic surveillance, the Supreme Court has twice rejected the use of ex parte \nproceedings on grounds that apply equally here.  In Alderman v. United States, the \nCourt addressed the procedures to be followed in determining whether government \neavesdropping in violation of the Fourth Amendment contributed to the prosecution \ncase against the defendants.   \n  The Court rejected the Government’s suggestion that the District Court make \nthat determination in camera and/or ex parte, and observed: \nAn  apparently  innocent  phrase,  a  chance  remark,  a \nreference to what appears to be a neutral person or event, \nthe identity of a caller or the individual on the other end of \na  telephone,  or  even  the  manner  of  speaking  or  using \nwords may have special significance to one who knows \nthe more intimate facts of an accused’s life.  And yet that \ninformation  may  be  wholly  colorless  and  devoid  of \nmeaning  to  one  less  well  acquainted  with  all  relevant \ncircumstances. \n \nId. at 182.   \n  In  ordering  disclosure  of  improperly  recorded  conversations,  the  Court \ndeclared: \nAdversary  proceedings  will  not  magically  eliminate  all \nerror, but they will substantially reduce its incidence by \nguarding  against  the  possibility  that  the  trial  judge, \n                                                                                                                                                               \ndeprivations.’…. [T]he very foundation of the adversary process assumes that use of undisclosed \ninformation  will  violate  due  process  because  of  the  risk  of  error.”    American-Arab  Anti-\nDiscrimination Committee v. Reno, 70 F.3d 1045, 1069 (9th Cir. 1995) (quoting District Court); \nsee, e.g., id. at 1070 (noting “enormous risk of error” in use of secret evidence); Kiareldeen v. \nReno, 71 F.Supp.2d 402, 412-14 (D.N.J. 1999) (same). \n  72\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 91 of 131 PageID #: 707\n \nthrough lack of time or unfamiliarity with the information \ncontained  in  and  suggested  by  the  materials,  will  be \nunable to provide the scrutiny that the Fourth Amendment \nexclusionary rule demands. \n \nId. at 184.   \n  Likewise, the Court held in Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), that a \ndefendant,  upon  a  preliminary  showing  of  an  intentional  or  reckless  material \nfalsehood in an affidavit underlying a search warrant, must be permitted to attack \nthe veracity of that affidavit.  The Court rested its decision in significant part on the \ninherent inadequacies of the ex parte nature of the procedure for issuing a search \nwarrant, and the contrasting enhanced value of adversarial proceedings: \nthe  hearing  before  the  magistrate  [when  the  warrant  is \nissued] not always will suffice to discourage lawless or \nreckless  misconduct.    The  pre-search  proceeding  is \nnecessarily ex parte, since the subject of the search cannot \nbe  tipped  off  to  the  application  for  a  warrant  lest  he \ndestroy or remove evidence.  The usual reliance of our \nlegal system on adversary proceedings itself should be an \nindication  that  an  ex  parte  inquiry  is  likely  to  be  less \nvigorous.  The magistrate has no acquaintance with the \ninformation  that  may  contradict  the  good  faith  and \nreasonable  basis  of  the  affiant’s  allegations.    The  pre-\nsearch  proceeding  will  frequently  be  marked  by  haste, \nbecause  of  the  understandable  desire  to  act  before  the \nevidence disappears; this urgency will not always permit \nthe magistrate to make an independent examination of the \naffiant or other witnesses. \n \nFranks, 438 U.S. at 169. \n  The  same  considerations  that  the  Supreme  Court  found  compelling  in \n  73\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 92 of 131 PageID #: 708\n \nAlderman  and  Franks  militate  against  ex  parte  procedures  in  the  FISA  context.  \nAfter  all,  denying  an  adversary  access  to  the  facts  constitutes  an  advantage  as \npowerful and insurmountable as exists in litigation. \n  Conversely,  the  lack  of  access  to  specific  facts  categorically  impairs  the \nability  of  a  defendant  (or  his  counsel,  even  cleared  counsel)  to  establish  non-\ncompliance with the strictures of 50 U.S.C. § 1881a.  For example, the factual \nbackground of this pleading can only be based on assumptions from the public \nrecord, including a heavily redacted 2011 FISC opinion and testimony before the \nPrivacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (hereinafter “PCLOB”) at a March 19, \n2014, public hearing.17 \n  However, courts have recognized that when defense counsel is compelled to \nargue in a vacuum devoid of a factual context to which only the Government and \n                                                 \n17    The PCLOB is an independent, bipartisan agency within the executive branch whose \nmembers are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. PCLOB, Report on the \nTelephone Records Program Conducted under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act and on the \nOperations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, 2 (Jan. 23, 2014).  The PCLOB \nconducted a public hearing March 19, 2014, at which the General Counsels of the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation, the National Security Agency, and the Director of National Intelligence, as well \nas the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice’s National Security \nDivision, provided testimony about programs  operated  under  §  1881a.    See Public Hearing \nRegarding  the  Surveillance  Program  Operated  Pursuant  to  Section  702  of  the  Foreign \nIntelligence  Surveillance  Act  Before  The  PCLOB  (2014)  (transcript  available  at \n<http://www.pclob.gov/Library/Meetings-Events/2014-March-19-Public-Hearing/19-March-\n2014_Public_Hearing_Transcript.pdf>).   \n \n  Nonetheless, even the PCLOB information is of limited value because, inter alia:  the \nwitnesses did not purport to provide information regarding the protocols and practices in effect at \nthe time of the surveillance in this case, which was probably from 2010-2011; the information \nprovided was limited to declassified material; and the testimony was not under oath, not from \nindividuals with first hand knowledge, and not subject to more than very limited questioning. \n  74\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 93 of 131 PageID #: 709\n \nthe court have access, a defendant’s burden must be alleviated.  As the Fourth \nCircuit has recognized in a closely analogous context – discerning what exculpatory \nevidence  a  witness  solely  within  the  Government’s  control,  and  to  whom  the \ndefense is denied access, can provide – when a defendant is deprived of such access, \nthe burden to be specific with respect to the material in question must be relaxed \naccordingly.  See United States v. Moussaoui, 382 F.3d 453, 472 (4th Cir. 2004), \nciting, United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, 458 U.S. 858, 870-71, 873 (1982). \n  Here,  that  adjustment  applies,  as  Hasbajrami  and  his  cleared  counsel  are \ncompelled to operate in a system in which the admissibility of evidence at the core \nof the Government’s case – in this case, in effect the entirety of the Government’s \ncase – is decided on the basis of a secret body of facts and law to which even \ncleared defense counsel is denied access. \n  Also, with respect to justification for disclosure of FISA and FAA materials \nto defense counsel in this case, the NSA’s non-compliance clearly rises to level \ndescribed in United States v. Duggan, 743 F.2d 59, 79 (2d Cir. 1984), in which the \nSecond Circuit, relying on FISA’s legislative history, explained that the need for \ndisclosure:  \nmight arise if the judge’s initial review revealed potential \nirregularities such as possible misrepresentations of fact, \nvague  identification  of  the  persons  to  be  surveilled,  or \nsurveillance records which include[] a significant amount \nof  nonforeign  intelligence  information,  calling  into \nquestion  compliance  with  the  minimization  standards \n  75\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 94 of 131 PageID #: 710\n \ncontained in the order[.] \n \nDuggan, 743 F.2d at 79; see also United States v.

Ott, 827 F.2d 473, 476 (9th Cir. 1987) (same). \n  Here, as previously discussed, the FISC opinions have provided that very \ncatalog of “irregularities.”  Accordingly, it is respectfully submitted that the Court \nshould order disclosure to cleared defense counsel the FISA and FAA applications \nand supporting materials, which will enable the Court to render its decisions with \nfull participation by defense counsel consistent with the principles of the adversary \nsystem.18 \nC.  The  details  of  the  FAA  electronic  surveillance  should  be \nproduced  because  motions  based  on  the  FAA’s \nunconstitutionality  and  application  against  Hasbajrami \nrequire full factual development           \n \nAs discussed in Defendant’s June 30, 2014 motion for discovery (ecf #76), \nwhich had been raised at the time in the context of Hasbajrami’s since-realized \ndesire to withdraw his guilty plea, the Government’s notice that it intended to use \nthe products of 50 U.S.C. § 1881a surveillance in proceedings in this case was \nmerely the starting point for consideration of the appropriate remedy that should be \nordered after the means, methods, and extent of the Government’s surveillance of \n                                                 \n18    See Hon.

See Press Release, DNI Declassifies Intelligence \nCommunity Documents Regarding Collection Under Section 702 of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) (Aug. 21, 2013).   \nAs such, this Court’s order should require specification of which procedures \nwere in effect on all dates that Hasbajrami was subject to surveillance because the \nDirector of National Intelligence (“DNI”) has acknowledged that rules during that \nrough time frame violated the Fourth Amendment.  \nIn a letter from the Director’s office to Senator Wyden, the DNI included the \nadmissions that \n  “on at least one occasion the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \nheld  that  some  collection  carried  out  pursuant  to  the  Section  702 \n  78\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 97 of 131 PageID #: 713\n \nminimization  procedures  used  by  the  government  was  unreasonable \nunder the Fourth Amendment,” and \n \n  the agency believed “the government’s  implementation  of Section 702  \nof FISA  has sometimes circumvented the spirit of the law, and on at \nleast one occasion the FISA Court has reached this same conclusion.” \n \nLetter from the Office of the DNI to Senator Ron Wyden, dated, July 20, 2012, \navailable  at  <http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/dangerroom/2012/07/2012-07-\n20-OLA-Ltr-to-Senator-Wyden-ref-Declassification-Request.pdf>  (last  accessed, \nNovember 23, 2014); see also [Case Name Redacted], supra, 2011 WL 10945618, \nat *16, *28 (FISC Oct. 3, 2011) (the case referenced by the DNI in its July 20, 2012 \nletter  to  Senator  Wyden);  Charlie  Savage,  N.S.A.  Said  to  Search  Content  of \nMessages To and From U.S., N.Y. Times, Aug. 8, 2013.  \nThe Government should be compelled to state whether the DNI’s response to \nSenator Wyden relates in any way to the investigation of Hasbajrami and/or this \ncase. \nFurther, because recent declassified FISC decisions have found that historical \ngovernment conduct from the outset of the FAA was unlawful, this Court should \norder  that  the  defense  have  access  to  all  decisions,  classified  or  not,  that  find \nproblems with the conduct of surveillance under the procedures in effect from 2010-\n2011, or earlier if any of the FAA surveillance referenced in the Government’s \nFebruary  24,  2014  notice  (ecf  #65)  was  surveillance  that  occurred  prior  to  the \noffense conduct alleged in Hasbajrami’s Indictment. \n  79\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 98 of 131 PageID #: 714\n \nAside from facial and as-applied constitutional challenges to the statute, as \nwell as the purely statutory claims, factual development and access to the relevant \nprotocols will enable the defense to present arguments regarding the second half of \nthe statutory suppression standard: whether the Government acted within the scope \nof the authorizations and orders.  Even assuming the FAA is valid, suppression is \nwarranted  if  the  “surveillance  was  not  made  in  conformity  with  an  order  of \nauthorization or approval.”  50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(e)(2), 1806(g).   \nAs set forth in Defendant’s Second Motion, supra, recently declassified FISC \nopinions  reveal  that  the  relevant  agencies  have  a  long  and  persistent  history  of \nviolating the limitations of FISC orders.  Without discovery regarding all of the \nsurrounding  factual  circumstances  of  the  surveillance,  the  defense  here  cannot \neffectively complete our arguments for suppression based on lack of compliance \nwith the required authorizations.  \nD.  The  complexity  and  the  need  for  accurate  factual  \ndeterminations  strongly  support  full  defense  access  to \nsurveillance material and advocacy regarding its significance \n \nThe scope of appropriate disclosure to the defense corresponds to the depth \nand complexity of the potential motions to suppress as well as to the potential for \ndisclosing Brady material.  The statute provides for an aggrieved person to file a \nmotion for suppression where the information was either unlawfully acquired or \nacquisition  was  conducted  outside  the  scope  of  an  order  of  authorization  or \n  80\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 99 of 131 PageID #: 715\n \napproval.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f).   \nTo be certain, information is unlawfully acquired if the statute is unlawfully \napplied or if the statute itself is unconstitutional.  See ACLU Found. of S.Cal. v. \nBarr, 952 F.2d 457, 465 (D.C.Cir. 1991) (“Section 1806[f] requires the court to \ndecide  whether  the  surveillance  was  ‘lawfully  authorized  and  conducted.’  The \nConstitution is law.”).   \nThe  Government’s  failure  to  adhere  to  the  limitations  on  the  scope  of \nsurveillance would therefore support Hasbajrami’s motions to suppress both direct \nand derivative evidence: \nIf the United States district court pursuant to subsection (f) \nof this section determines that the surveillance was not \nlawfully authorized or conducted, it shall, in accordance \nwith the requirements of law, suppress the evidence which \nwas  unlawfully  obtained  or  derived  from  electronic \nsurveillance of the aggrieved person or otherwise grant the \nmotion of the aggrieved person. \n \n50 U.S.C. § 1806(g).   \nEven  if  the  suppression  motions  are  denied,  this  Court  must  review  the \ninformation to determine whether material considered in relation to the motion, \nassuming it was reviewed ex parte, requires production as Brady material: “If the \ncourt determines that the surveillance was lawfully authorized and conducted, it \nshall deny the motion of the aggrieved person except to the extent that due process \nrequires discovery or disclosure.” Id. \n  81\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 100 of 131 PageID #: 716\n \nThe statute confers authority on this Court to order disclosure to defense \ncounsel “where such disclosure is necessary to make an accurate determination of \nthe legality of the surveillance.”  50 U.S.C. § 1806(f).  In this provision, Congress \nintended to strike “a reasonable balance between an entirely in camera proceeding \nwhich  might  adversely  affect  the  defendant’s  ability  to  defend  himself,  and \nmandatory disclosure, which might occasionally result in the wholesale revelation \nof sensitive foreign intelligence information.”  S.Rep.No. 95-701 at 64 (1978).   \nThe developments since the Snowden disclosures and the institutionalized \nsuppression of notice revealed after Clapper establish that this case fits exactly what \nCongress  thought  should  trigger  full  defense  participation:  disclosure  may  be \n“necessary” when there are “indications of possible misrepresentation of fact” and \nother problems indicating the need for adversarial review.  Id. \nCourts have explained that disclosure to the defense is warranted if the legal \nand factual issues involved in reviewing the surveillance are “complex,” and where \n“the question of legality may be complicated by factors such as ‘indications of \npossible  misrepresentation  of  fact,  vague  identification  of  the  persons  to  be \nsurveilled,  or  surveillance  records  which  include  a  significant  amount  of  non-\nforeign  intelligence  information,  calling  into  question  compliance  with  the \nminimization standards contained in the order.’ ” United States v. Belfield, 692 F.2d \n141, 147 (D.C.Cir. 1982) (quoting S.Rep.No. 95-701 at 64 [1978]); accord United \n  82\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 101 of 131 PageID #: 717\n \nStates v. Ott, 827 F.2d 473, 476 (9th Cir. 1987).   \nThese factors must be assessed in light of the Supreme Court’s recognition \nthat  valuable  defense  input  is  lost  when  review  of  the  legality  of  electronic \nsurveillance is conducted ex parte.  See Alderman v. United States, supra, 394 U.S. \n165, 184  (1969); see also United States v. Abu-Jihaad, supra, 630 F.3d 102, 141 (2d \nCir. 2010) (“Although applicable in criminal cases, the state-secrets privilege must – \nunder some circumstances – ‘give way … to a criminal defendant’s right to present \na meaningful defense.’ ”), quoting, United States v. Stewart, 590 F.3d 93, 131 (2d \nCir. 2009). \nWe note that if the Government asserts the “state-secrets” privilege as a basis \nfor its continued refusal to disclose the material under dispute, the Second Circuit \nhas held that the test announced in Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53 (1957), \nshould  be  applied.    See  Abu-Jihaad,  630  F.3d  at  141.    As  the  Second  Circuit \nexplained, the first question is “whether the material in dispute is discoverable, and \nif so, whether the state-secrets privilege applies,” and the second question is, if the \nprivilege applies, “whether the information is helpful or material to the defense, i.e., \nuseful  to  counter  the  government’s  case  or  to  bolster  a  defense.”    Id.,  quoting \nStewart, 590 F.3d at 131 (citing Roviaro). \nThe Second Circuit also observed, however, “Information that is helpful or \nmaterial  to  the  defense  ‘need  not  rise  to  the  level  that  would  trigger  the \n  83\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 102 of 131 PageID #: 718\n \nGovernment’s  obligation  under  Brady  v.  Maryland  …  to  disclose  exculpatory \ninformation.’ ”  Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d at 141 n.33, quoting, United States v. Aref, \nsupra, 533 F.3d 72, 80 (2d Cir. 2008), and citing, United States v. Mejia, 448 F.3d \n436, 457 (D.C.Cir. 2006) (observing that, for purposes of the analogous provisions \nof the Classified Information Procedures Act, “information can be helpful without \nbeing ‘favorable’ in the Brady sense”). \nE.  The  balance  of  the  factors  this  Court  considers  in \ndetermining  defense  participation  requires  full  defense \naccess and advocacy               \n \nUnder the present circumstances, the balance strongly favors disclosure: the \nneed for government secrecy has been radically reduced by the public disclosures of \npreviously secret programs; the need for adversary proceedings has been recognized \nby a presidential study group; the legal and factual complexity of the issues in this \ncase favor full defense participation; and there are reasonable grounds to question \nthe candor and completeness of the security apparatus’s representations. \n1.  The need for secrecy has been reduced by the Edward \nSnowden disclosures             \n \nThe  Government  has  either  publicly  acknowledged  or  failed  to  deny  the \nbroad range of electronic surveillance now attributed to it.  Prior to Hasbajrami’s \nguilty plea, the mass collection of telephone and Internet content and metadata was \nspeculative;  now  it  is  fact.    As  a  result  of  the  Snowden  disclosures  and  other \nrevelations, there are no longer compelling reasons for secrecy, or to the extent they \n  84\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 103 of 131 PageID #: 719\n \nremain,  cleared  defense  counsel  should  be  allowed  look  under  the  veil.    The \ngathering of all of Hasbajrami’s telephone call and Internet metadata (along with \neveryone else’s metadata) was not previously known, but now the secret is out. The \nGovernment  likely  has  records  of  every  one  of  Hasbajrami’s  calls  and  Internet \ncommunications prior to any FISA warrant.   \nThe only questions remaining are whether and under what circumstances the \nGovernment obtained and accessed surveillance, the lawfulness of the authority or \nconduct of the surveillance, and how the patterns of communication can be helpful \nto the defense. The Government need for ex parte proceedings has collapsed now \nthat the secrets this Court was balancing against disclosure are part of general public \ndiscourse. \n2.  The benefits of adversarial proceedings are recognized \nby the President’s Review Group         \n \nThe  public  debate  surrounding  the  Snowden  disclosures  has  exposed  the \nserious flaws that ex parte proceedings import into the structure of our country’s \nlegal  system.    President  Obama’s  national  security  review  recognized  that  our \nadversary system is compromised, and the benefits of defense advocacy are lost, in \na  system  that  does  not  include  an  advocate  for  individual  privacy.    See  The \nPresident’s  Review  Group  on  Intelligence  and  Communications  Technologies, \nLiberty and Security in a Changing World, Recommendation 28 (Dec. 12, 2013) \n(recommending, inter alia, “Congress should create the position of Public Interest \n  85\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 104 of 131 PageID #: 720\n \nAdvocate  to  represent  privacy  and  civil  liberties  interests  before  the  Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court,” and “the transparency of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance  Court’s  decisions  should  be  increased,  including  by  instituting \ndeclassification reviews that comply with existing standards”) (available at <http:// \nwww.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/2013-12-12_rg_final_report.pdf>)(last \naccessed, November 24, 2014).   \nThe rationale for an advocate before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt applies equally to the need for security-cleared counsel in this case to provide \ntechnological and legal perspectives to balance against the Government’s one-sided \npresentations in proceedings before the District Court: \nOur legal tradition is committed to the adversary system.  \nWhen  the  government  initiates  a  proceeding  against  a \nperson, that person is usually entitled to representation by \nan advocate who is committed to protecting her interests.  \nIf it is functioning well, the adversary system is an engine \nof truth.  It is built on the assumption that judges are in a \nbetter position to find the right answer on questions of law \nand fact when they hear competing views. When the FISC \nwas created, it was assumed that it would resolve routine \nand  individualized  questions  of  fact,  akin  to  those \ninvolved when the government seeks a search warrant. It \nwas not anticipated that the FISC would address the kinds \nof  questions  that  benefit  from,  or  require,  an  adversary \npresentation.  When the government applies for a warrant, \nit  must  establish  “probable  cause,”  but  an  adversary \nproceeding is not involved.  As both technology and the \nlaw  have  evolved  over  time,  however,  the  FISC  is \nsometimes  presented  with  novel  and  complex  issues  of \nlaw.  The resolution of such issues would benefit from an \nadversary proceeding. \n  86\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 105 of 131 PageID #: 721\n \n \nIn our system of justice, defense counsel standing for the \nrights  of  the  accused  traditionally  provides  competing \narguments needed by a neutral decision-maker. \n \nWe  have  elected  to  employ  an  adversary  system  of \ncriminal  justice  in  which  the  parties  contest  all  issues \nbefore a court of law. The need to develop all relevant \nfacts  in  the  adversary  system  is  both  fundamental  and \ncomprehensive.  The ends of criminal justice would be \ndefeated if judgments were to be founded on a partial or \nspeculative presentation of the facts. \n \nUnited States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 709 (1974) (citation omitted).    \nWhile recognizing that secrecy is sometimes permissible, this Court acts in \nthe best traditions of our justice system by recognizing the benefits of full adversary \nparticipation where, as here, the circumstances call for careful scrutiny of complex \nlegal issues based on voluminous material. \n3.  The  complexity  of  the  legal  issues  warrants  defense \nparticipation               \n \nSubstantial issues exist regarding the constitutionality of the FAA as well as \nthe application of the FAA and other surveillance programs to Hasbajrami.  These \nconcerns were readily evident from the colloquies between Respondent’s lawyer \nand several of the Justices during the Clapper oral argument. Justice Kagan noted \nthat  the  FAA  “greatly  expands  the  government’s  surveillance  power.    Nobody \ndenies that.” Transcript of Oral Argument at 17, Clapper, 133 S.Ct. 1138 (2013).  \nSimilarly, Justice Ginsburg noted that certain checks required for traditional FISA \n  87\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 106 of 131 PageID #: 722\n \nsurveillance do not exist in the FAA: \nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Jaffer, could you be clear on \nthe expanded authority under the FAA? As I understood it, \nit’s not like in [FISA], where a target was identified and \n… the court decided whether there was probable cause.   \nUnder this new statute, the government doesn’t say who \nthe particular person or the particular location.  So, there \nisn’t that check.  There isn’t that check. \n \nMR. JAFFER: That’s absolutely right, Justice Ginsburg \n…  the  whole  point  of  the  statute  was  to  remove  those \ntests, to remove the probable cause requirement, and to \nremove … the requirement that the government identify to \nthe court the facilities to be monitored.  So those are gone. \n \nThat’s why we use the phrase “dragnet surveillance.”  I \nknow  the  government  doesn’t  accept  that  label,  but  it \nconcedes that the statute allows what it calls categorical \nsurveillance, which … is essentially the surveillance the \nplaintiffs here are concerned about. \n \nId. at 32-33.   \nJustice Breyer stated that the program is not limited to wiretapping alleged \nterrorists  or  foreign  agents,  noting  that  any  conversation  touching  on  “foreign \nintelligence” information could be implicated: “the definition of foreign intelligence \ninformation … defines it to include information with respect to a foreign power or \nforeign territory that relates to the conduct of foreign affairs. It’s very general.” Id. \nat 43. \nThe competing interests of privacy and national security are also the subject \nof a current judicial debate regarding whether the defense perspective is essential to \n  88\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 107 of 131 PageID #: 723\n \na fair disposition.  Compare Klayman v. Obama, Docket No. 13-0851, 2013 WL \n6571596  (D.D.C.  Dec.  16,  2013)  (the  metadata  collection  program  likely \nunconstitutional)  with  ACLU  v.  Clapper,  Docket  No.  13  Civ.  3994,  2013  WL \n6819708 (SDNY Dec. 27, 2013) (upholding the metadata collection program).   \nSimilarly,  the  President’s  Review  Group  used  collection  of  telephone \nmetadata  under  section  215  of  FISA  as  a  “good  example”  of  the  “serious  and \ndifficult  questions  of  statutory  and  constitutional  interpretation  about  which \nreasonable lawyers and judges could certainly differ,” finding that better decisions \nresult from adversary presentations: \nOn  such  a  question,  an  adversary  presentation  of  the \ncompeting  arguments  is  likely  to  result  in  a  better \ndecision.    Hearing  only  the  government’s  side  of  the \nquestion  leaves  the  judge  without  a  researched  and \ninformed presentation of an opposing view. \n \nReview Group Report at 203-04.   \nIn addition to debating the scope and lawfulness of surveillance, a defense \nadvocate  is  necessary  to  present  the  legal  arguments  on  the  inclusion  of  false \nstatements or material omissions within the meaning of Franks v. Delaware, 438 \nU.S. 154 (1978), on the use of evidence derived from earlier unlawful surveillance \nto make decisions under Murray v. United States, supra, 487 U.S. 533, 542-43 \n(1988), and to held determine whether the use of any such derivative evidence in \nsubsequent FISA applications requires suppression as the “fruit of the poisonous \n  89\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 108 of 131 PageID #: 724\n \ntree” under Silverthorne v. United States, supra, 251 U.S. 385, 392 (1920), Nardone \nv. United States, supra, 308 U.S. 338, 342 (1939), and/or Wong Sun v. United \nStates, supra, 371 U.S. 471, 488 (1963). \n  Further,  compliance  with  complicated  statutes  upon  which  there  is  little \nprecedent militates in favor of defense participation. The simple determination of \nprobable cause in the standard FISA case is often “relatively straightforward and not \ncomplex.” United States v. Abu-Jihaad, supra, 630 F.3d 102, 129 (2d Cir. 2010).   \nAlthough the FISA issues in the present case have their own share of novelty \nand complexity, the complicated legal and factual issues under the FAA receive \nlittle guidance from the Circuit Courts or other Districts about how to evaluate the \nconstitutionality  of  orders  granting  applications  for  FAA  surveillance  or  actual \nexecution of the surveillance.  Indeed, this is the first case in this Circuit to address \nthis issue.   \nAs such, defense advocacy is reasonable and necessary given the serious and \ndifficult  questions  this  case  presents,  as  well  as  the  importance  and  effect  any \nprecedent  will  create.    In  addition,  the  Government’s  previous  non-disclosure \nfurther demonstrates the need for defense counsel participation in the process of \nadjudicating all aspects of Hasbajrami’s motions. \n  90\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 109 of 131 PageID #: 725\n \n4.  Congress  anticipated  that  evidence  of \nmisrepresentation  and  other  over-reaching  would \nfavor disclosure and defense participation      \n \nThe  legislative  history  of  FISA  specifically  stated  that  “indications  of \npossible  misrepresentation  of  fact”  could  establish  the  necessity  for  defense \nparticipation  in  discovery  and  suppression  proceedings.  S.Rep.  95-701  at  64. \nCongress  set  an  intentionally  low  bar  for  favoring  defense  participation: \n“indications” and “possible”.  Here, of course, this Court has already concluded that \n“[w]hen the government provided FISA notice without FAA notice, Hasbajrami was \nmisled about an important aspect of his case,” misrepresentation which resulted \nfrom “a DOJ policy that transcended this case” (Order, dated, October 2, 2014, at 6 \n[ecf #85]).   \nAs a result, the intentionally misleading FISA notice that the Government \noriginally filed in this case, which misled Hasbajrami but also presented a fraud \nupon defense counsel and this Court, provides a legitimate basis to view any ex \nparte Government submission with great suspicion in this case; such, we submit, \nsupports the need to permit adversarial testing in all aspects of the defendant’s \nsuppression motions.   \nWe  respectfully  submit  that  Hasbajrami,  or,  at  a  minimum  this  Court,  is \nentitled to know, for example, if the Government misled the FISC when it sought \nauthorization to conduct FAA surveillance, assuming the Government did in fact \n  91\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 110 of 131 PageID #: 726\n \nrequest such authorization, as well as whether the Government misled the FISC \nwhen it subsequently applied for FISA warrants in this case.  Failure to provide such \nnotice to the FISC would be relevant to the Constitutional issues presented in this \ncase. \nIt is worth noting that it cannot be presumed that the Government understood \nand/or followed its obligations when interacting with the FISC in association with \nits investigation of Hasbajrami and others related to this case. On August 21, 2013, \nthe Government declassified the opinion of District Judge John Bates holding that \naspects of the surveillance authorized by 50 U.S.C. § 1881a (i.e., Section 702 of the \nFAA) was unconstitutional.  See [Case Name Redacted], supra, No. [docket number \nredacted], 2011 WL 10945618 (FISC Oct. 3, 2011).  While ultimately continuing \nsurveillance  authorizations  after  insisting  on  modification  of  the  minimization \nprotocols,  Judge  Bates  made  a  record  of  serious  concerns  regarding  the  legal \nauthority and agency actions in carrying out that authority. \nThe opinion detailed the Government’s May 2011 disclosure to the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court that, contrary to previous statements, the NSA was \nrelying on the FAA to collect Internet communications that are “wholly unrelated to \nthe tasked selector, including the full content of discrete communications that are \nnot to, from, or about the facility tasked for collection,” and that the NSA “might \nlack  confidence  in  the  effectiveness”  of  procedures  for  ensuring  that  persons \n  92\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 111 of 131 PageID #: 727\n \ntargeted with FAA surveillance of their Internet transactions are actually located \noverseas.   Id. at *2.   \nIn  other  words,  at  the  very  same  time  it  was  conducting  electronic \nsurveillance  and  interception  of  Hasbajrami’s  communications,  the  Government \n“advised  the  Court  that  the  volume  and  nature  of  the  information  it  has  been \ncollecting is fundamentally different from what the Court had been led to believe.” \nId. at *9. These disclosures “fundamentally alter[ed] the Court’s understanding of \nthe  scope  of  the  collection  conducted  pursuant  to  Section  702,”  which  had \npreviously  been  based  on  erroneous  representations  that  “acquisition  of  Internet \ncommunications  under  Section  702  would  be  limited  to  discrete  ‘to/from’ \ncommunications  between  or  among  individual  account  users  and  to  ‘about’ \ncommunications  falling  within  [redacted]  specific  categories  that  had  been  first \ndescribed to the Court in prior proceedings.” Id. at *5. \nThe  Government’s  applications  for  authorization  to  conduct  FAA \nsurveillance  in  that  instance  therefore  contained  all  of  the  problems  that  justify \ndisclosure:  “misrepresentation  of  fact,  vague  identification  of  the  persons  to  be \nsurveilled,  [and  collection  of]  surveillance  records  which  include  a  significant \namount of non-foreign intelligence information, calling into question compliance \nwith  the  minimization  standards”  contained  in  past  orders.    United  States  v. \nBelfield,  692  F.2d  141,  147  (D.C.Cir.  1982).    These  problems  also  appear  to \n  93\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 112 of 131 PageID #: 728\n \ncoincide temporally with the period of FAA surveillance related to Hasbajrami’s \nprosecution. \nThe  errors  in  the  Government’s  applications  to  the  FISC,  including  its \napplications for FAA surveillance authorization, are not merely “typographical or \nclerical in nature.”  United States v. El-Mezain, 664 F.3d 467, 566 (5th Cir. 2011) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). Rather, “the errors [are] . . . pervasive enough to \nconfuse the court as to the quantity or quality of the evidence described in the \napplications,” such that “disclosing the applications and related materials to defense \ncounsel would assist the court in making an accurate determination of the legality of \nthe surveillance.”  Id. at 567 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nNotably, in a separate disclosure, it has been revealed that Government agents \nhave been laundering intelligence from NSA electronic intercepts to disguise their \norigins:  “[L]aw  enforcement  agents  have  been  directed  to  conceal  how  such \ninvestigations truly begin – not only from defense lawyers but also sometimes from \nprosecutors and judges.”  John Shiffman & Kristina Cooke, U.S. directs agents to \ncover up program used to investigate Americans, Reuters, Aug. 5, 2013.    \nThe governmental agencies that distributed information include the FBI, the \nCIA, and the NSA, all of which were likely involved in the present case.  Although \nthe Reuters documents are undated, they “show that federal agents are trained to \n‘recreate’  the  investigative  trail  to  effectively  cover  up  where  information \n  94\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 113 of 131 PageID #: 729\n \noriginated.”  Id.  Interviews with law enforcement personnel showed the practice, \ndenominated  “parallel  construction,”  is  widespread  to  protect  sources,  but \n“employing the practice as a means of disguising how an investigation began may \nviolate  pretrial  discovery  rules  by  burying  evidence  that  could  prove  useful  to \ncriminal defendants.” Id. \nGiven the record of affirmative misrepresentations and omissions made by \nthe Government in its applications for 50 U.S.C. § 1881a authorizations (as well as \nits misrepresentations and omissions in applications for orders authorizing other \nforms of FISA surveillance), discovery is warranted so that the defense and this \nCourt may effectively assess whether the fruits of those authorizations must now be \nsuppressed. \nIndeed, because numerous FISC opinions – including opinions authorizing \nFAA surveillance – remain classified, the defense has no way to know the extent of \nthe  Government’s  misrepresentations  to  the  FISC  and  noncompliance  with  its \norders.  As such, for all of these reasons, we respectfully submit that disclosure \nunder 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f) is necessary to permit the adversarial testing that accurate \nreview of these issues requires. \nF.  This  Court  should  grant  discovery  because  litigation \nregarding  the  lawfulness  of  Government  surveillance \naccomplishes  important  societal  purposes  of  transparency \nand deterrence                 \n \nMeaningful  review  regarding  the  Government’s  compliance,  or  lack  of \n  95\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 114 of 131 PageID #: 730\n \ncompliance, with the FAA and thereafter with FISA, accomplishes essential societal \nfunctions beyond protection of the defendant’s individual rights. Constitutions and \nstatutes are merely a collection of toothless platitudes in some countries.  In the \nUnited  States,  transparency  and  deterrence  of  governmental  misconduct  are \nessential  to  the  rule  of  law  that  sets  us  apart  by  giving  the  promise  of  justice \nmeaning in the real world.  \n50 U.S.C. § 1881a specifically protects not merely United States citizens, but \nanyone located within the United States at the time of the surveillance – such should \nbe particularly true here where the defendant was a legal immigrant living in the \nUnited States on a permanent visa, not someone who entered this country illegally \nor with an unlawful purpose in mind.19  As such, the public interest strongly favors \ndiscovery and defense participation in all proceedings. \nG.  This Court should also require the Government to provide \nthe  defense  with  notice  of  any  other  surveillance  statutes \nand/or  programs  it  used  and/or  relied  upon  during  the \ninvestigation of this case to which Hasbajrami was aggrieved \n \nFinally, given the number of surveillance programs that the Government has \nconcealed for years, it is possible that the Government relied on other, still-secret \nsurveillance  techniques  in  its  investigations  of  Hasbajrami.    Discovery  thus  far \nsuggests that the Government tracked Hasbajrami’s location, financial activities, \n                                                 \n19   There  is  no  dispute  that  Hasbajrami  immigrated  to  the  United  States  to  pursue  the \nAmerican dream, and that he was only first exposed to radical Islam after he had moved to \nBrooklyn. \n  96\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 115 of 131 PageID #: 731\n \nand communications.  However, the Government belated FAA notice also indicates \nthat  the  Government  has  been  less  than  candid  in  complying  with  its  notice \nobligations.   \nThus,  to  ensure  that  Hasbajrami’s  right  to  Due  Process  is  not  still  being \ninfringed  upon  in  manners  simply  not  yet  revealed,  Hasbajrami’s  motion  for \ndiscovery,  including  notice  of  undisclosed  surveillance,  is  not  limited  to  the \nsurveillance  programs  described  above  nor  even  those  methods  publicly \nacknowledged to date.  See, e.g., Charlie Savage & Mark Mazzetti, C.I.A. Collects \nGlobal  Data  on  Transfers  of  Money,  N.Y.  Times,  Nov.  13,  2013, \nhttp://nyti.ms/1lbhseL  (“Several  officials  also  said  more  than  one  other  bulk \ncollection program has yet to come to light.”).  Indeed, with respect to monitoring \nfinancial transactions, during Hasbajrami’s first encounter with FBI agents he was \nasked by them (prior to any relevant discussion) whether he had ever sent any \nmoney overseas. \nAs  such,  Hasbajrami’s  request  for  notice  encompasses  any  surveillance \nprogram or technique that the Government relied upon to monitor Hasbajrami’s \ncommunications or activities as part of its investigation related to this case.  See 18 \nU.S.C. § 3504; see also 50 U.S.C. § 1845; Due Process Clause, Fifth Amend., U.S. \nConst. \n  97\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 116 of 131 PageID #: 732\n \nH.  Conclusion \nAccordingly, for all of the reasons discussed above, the defense respectfully \nrequests that the Government be directed to disclose the following, either directly to \ncounsel, or, at a minimum, to this Court for in camera review: \n1.  Any “foreign intelligence information” relevant to this case that has not \nbeen previously disclosed to the defense; \n \n2.  Whether  the  FAA  surveillance  relied  upon  against  Hasbajrami \nintentionally  targeted  the  defendant  (see  50  U.S.C.  §§  1881a[b][1], \n1881a[b][2]), and/or engaged in “reverse targeting” of him; \n \n3.  Whether  the  FAA  surveillance  relied  upon  against  Hasbajrami \nintentionally targeted “a United States person reasonably believed to be \nlocated outside of the United States” (50 U.S.C. § 1881a[b][3]); \n \n4.  Whether  the  FAA  surveillance  relied  upon  against  Hasbajrami \n“intentionally acquire[d] any communication as to which the sender and \nall intended recipients [were] known at the time of the acquisition to be \nlocated in the United States” (50 U.S.C. § 1881a[b][4]); \n \n5.  Whether  the  Government  has  any  reason  to  believe  that  the  FAA \nsurveillance  relied  upon  against  Hasbajrami  were  not  “conducted  in  a \nmanner consistent with the fourth amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States” (50 U.S.C. § 1881a[b][5]); \n \n6.  Copies of all FISA warrants and FISA warrant applications not previously \ndisclosed to the defense in this case; \n \n7.  Material  documenting  what  minimization  and  targeting  procedures  and \ninterpretive instructions were in effect at the time any foreign intelligence \nevidence or information was gathered, and how those procedures were \nimplemented (i.e., who was being targeted, what was the basis for that \ntargeting,  and  what  minimization  procedures  were  used  during  that \ntargeting); \n \n  98\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 117 of 131 PageID #: 733\n \n8.  What information, if anything, was told to was the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court (FISC) about FAA surveillance relative to Hasbajrami \n(or other persons relevant to this case) in approving any FISA warrants in \nthis case;  \n \n9.  Notice of whether any other surveillance programs were utilized and/or \nrelied  upon  during  the  investigation  of  this  case  and  aggrieved \nHasbajrami; and \n \n10. Notice of whether any “programmatic analytics” were utilized, or whether \ncross-referencing  or  searching  or  analysis  occurred  with  respect  to  the \ninformation derived from FAA and FISA surveillance and interception, \nand/or  any  other  surveillance,  interception,  collection,  and/or  retention \nprogram. \n \nSixth Motion \nMOTION  FOR  AN  ORDER  DIRECTING  THE \nGOVERNMENT  TO  IDENTIFY  ANY  AND  ALL \nWITNESSES THAT IT LEARNED OF DURING, OR \nAS  A  RESULT  OF,  THE  INTERROGATION  OF \nTHE DEFENDANT             \n \n  Pursuant  to  Rule  12(b)(4)  and  Rule  16  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Criminal \nProcedure,  the  defendant  respectfully  requests  that  this  Court  issue  an  order \ndirecting the Government to specify in detail any witness about whom they became \naware of through, or as a result of, interrogation of Agron Hasbajrami described \nDefendant’s Fourth Motion, supra.  This information is necessary to enable the \ndefense to move for exclusion of the testimony of such witness(es), should the \nGovernment elect to call such witness(es) at trial. \n  99\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 118 of 131 PageID #: 734\n \nSeventh Motion \nMOTION  FOR  AN  ORDER  DIRECTING  THE \nGOVERNMENT  TO  SPECIFY  ALL  EVIDENCE \nTHAT  IS  SUBJECT  TO  SUPPRESSION  AND/OR \nPRECLUSION  AS  A  RESULT  OF  THE \nINTERROGATION OF THE DEFENDANT     \n \n  Pursuant  to  Rule  12(b)(4)  and  Rule  16  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Criminal \nProcedure, the defendant respectfully requests that the Court issue an order directing \nthe Government to specify in detail any evidence that it intends to offer at trial, \nwhich the Government became aware of either directly or indirectly through the \ninterrogation of Hasbajrami described in Defendant’s Fourth Motion, supra.  This \ninformation  is  necessary  to  enable  the  defense  to  move  for  exclusion  of  the \ntestimony of such witness(es), should the Government elect to call those witness(es) \nat trial. \nEighth Motion \n \nMOTION  FOR  AN  ORDER  DIRECTING  THE \nGOVERNMENT  TO  PROVIDE  IMMEDIATE \nNOTICE  OF  EXPERT  WITNESSES  IT  INTENDS \nTO RELY UPON AT TRIAL          \n \n  Pursuant  to  Rule  12(b)(4)  and  Rule  16  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Criminal \nProcedure,  the  defendant  respectfully  requests  that  this  Court  issue  an  order \ndirecting the Government to provide immediate notice of any expert witnesses it \nintends to rely upon at trial.  This information is necessary to enable the defense to \n  100\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 119 of 131 PageID #: 735\n \nmove to limit or exclude the testimony of such witness(es), should the Government \nelect to call such witness(es) at trial. \nNinth Motion \n \nMOTION  FOR  IMMEDIATE  PRODUCTION  OF \nBRADY/GIGLIO MATERIAL         \n \nAs a result of our review of information disclosed in this case, as well as our \nknowledge of relevant and related information disclosed in other cases to which the \nundersigned has been involved, defense counsel have a good faith basis to believe \nthat  information  favorable  to  the  defense  exists  in  this  case  that  will  require \nextensive litigation in order to determine what aspects of such evidence may be \npresented  to  the  jury.    As  such,  due  to  this  Court’s  stated  desire  to  avoid \nunnecessary delay, we respectfully submit that all information that is discoverable \nto the defense under either Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 104 (1963), or United \nStates  v.  Giglio,  405  U.S.  150  (1972),  should  be  immediately  disclosed  to  the \ndefense.  See also Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419 (1995); United States v. Mahaffy, \n693 F.3d 113, 130 (2d Cir. 2012). \nAs such, beyond evidence favorable to the defense under Brady, we also \nspecifically request that the Government produce, for immediate review, all Giglio \nmaterial, which would include any information that would substantially impeach the \ncredibility of an important Government witness, including but not limited to, expert \n  101\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 120 of 131 PageID #: 736\n \nwitnesses that the Government intends to rely upon at trial.  This request, more fully \naddressed in the legal discussion below, includes, with regard to such witnesses: \n1.  Prior inconsistent statements, including, but not limited to, inconsistent \nattorney proffers (see United States v. Triumph Capital Group, 544 \nF.3d 149 [2d Cir. 2008]); \n  \n2.  Statements or reports reflecting witness statement variations; \n \n3.  Benefits provided to witnesses including: \n \na.  Dropped or reduced charges \nb.  Immunity \nc.  Expectations of downward departures or motions for reduction of \nsentence \nd.  Assistance in a state or local criminal proceeding  \ne.  Considerations regarding forfeiture of assets \nf.  Stays of deportation or other immigration status considerations \ng.  S-Visas  \nh.  Monetary benefits \ni.  Non-prosecution agreements \nj.  Letters to other law enforcement officials (e.g., state prosecutors, \nparole boards) setting forth the extent of a witness’s assistance or \nmaking substantive recommendations on the witness’s behalf  \nk.  Relocation assistance \nl.  Consideration or benefits to culpable or at risk third-parties \n \n4.  Other known conditions that could affect the witness’s bias such as: \n \na.  Animosity toward defendant \nb.  Animosity toward a group of which the defendant is a member or \nwith which the defendant is affiliated \nc.  Relationship with victim \nd.  Known  but  uncharged  criminal  conduct  (that  may  provide  an \nincentive to curry favor with a prosecutor) \n \n5.  Prior acts under Fed.R.Evid. 608; \n \n6.  Prior convictions under Fed.R.Evid. 609; \n  102\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 121 of 131 PageID #: 737\n \n \n7.  Known substance abuse or mental health issues or other issues that \ncould affect the witness’s ability to perceive and recall events; and \n \n8.  With particular respect to expert witnesses, any other information that \ncould  bare  upon  their  bias,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  any \ninformation that bares upon the independence of their testimony and \nwhether they had ever, to the Government’s knowledge, testified in a \nmanner that was intended to intentionally mislead the Court, the jury, \nand/or defense counsel. \n \nThe law has long been clear that Brady v. Maryland, supra, 373 U.S. 83, 104 \n(1963), requires the Government to disclose evidence “favorable” to the defense as \nto guilt or punishment.  To be favorable, evidence need not be determinative of guilt \nor innocence, but must “tend to exculpate” the defendant.  See Brady, 373 U.S. at \n88.   \nA  defendant  is  also  entitled  to  disclosure  of  “evidence  affecting  [the] \ncredibility” of a witness whose reliability may be dispositive of guilt or innocence.  \nUnited States v. Giglio, supra, 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972), quoting, Napue v. Illinois, \n360 U.S. 264, 269 (1959).  As stated by the Supreme Court in United States v. \nBagley, 473 U.S. 667 (1985), “[i]mpeachment evidence ... as well as exculpatory \nevidence, falls within the Brady rule.”  Id. at 674, citing Giglio, 405 U.S. at 150.  \nThis is self-evident, since “[t]he jury’s estimate of the truthfulness and reliability of \na given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence.”  United States v. \nSeijo, 514 F.2d 1357, 1364 (2d Cir. 1975), quoting, Napue, 360 U.S. at 269. \n  103\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 122 of 131 PageID #: 738\n \nIt has long been the rule that Brady material, including material to be used to \nimpeach critical Government witnesses, must be turned over sufficiently in advance \nof trial to allow “for full exploration and exploitation by the defense.”  Grant v. \nAlldredge, 498 F.2d 376, 382 (2d Cir. 1974); see also United States v. Baum, 482 \nF.2d 1325, 1331 (2d Cir. 1973) (“Ordinarily it is disclosure rather than suppression, \nthat promotes the proper administration of criminal justice.”).  Indeed, “There is no \ndoubt  that  the  timing  of  disclosure  under  Brady  and  Giglio  may  be  of  critical \nimportance in many criminal cases.”  United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d 132, 138 (2d \nCir. 2001).  As such, disclosure is required “in time for its effective use at trial or at \na plea proceeding” and “the time required for the effective use of a particular item \nof evidence … depend[s] on the materiality of that evidence,” which, of course, \nonly the prosecutor can determine prior to disclosure.  Coppa, 267 F.3d at 146. \nThe United States Attorney Manual recommends broader discovery than even \nthat specifically prescribed by Brady, Giglio, or Kyles:   \nDepartment policy recognizes that a fair trial will often \ninclude  examination  of  relevant  exculpatory  or \nimpeachment information that is significantly probative of \nthe issues before the court but that may not, on its own, \nresult in an acquittal or, as is often colloquially expressed, \nmake the difference between guilt and innocence.  As a \nresult,  this  policy  requires  disclosure  by  prosecutors  of \ninformation beyond that which is “material” to guilt as \narticulated in Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419 (1995), and \nStrickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 280-81 (1999). \n \nUnited States Attorney’s Manual (“USAM”) § 9-5.001(C).   \n  104\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 123 of 131 PageID #: 739\n \nSimilarly, in reviewing what material should be provided in this case, we \nsuggest that the following excerpts of Sections 9-5.001 and 9-5.100 of the United \nStates Attorney Manual should also be considered: \n1.  Additional exculpatory information that must be \ndisclosed.  A prosecutor must disclose information \nthat is inconsistent with any element of any crime \ncharged against the defendant or that established a \nrecognized  affirmative  defense,  regardless  of \nwhether  the  prosecutor  believes  such  information \nwill  make  the  difference  between  conviction  and \nacquittal of the defendant for a charged crime. \n \n2.  Additional impeachment information that must \nbe  disclosed.    A  prosecutor  must  disclose \ninformation  that  either  casts  a  substantial  doubt \nupon the accuracy of any evidence – including but \nnot limited to witness testimony – the prosecutor \nintends to rely on to prove an element of any crime \ncharged, or might have a significant bearing on the \nadmissibility  of  prosecution  evidence.    This \ninformation must be disclosed regardless of whether \nit  is  likely  to  make  the  difference  between \nconviction  and  acquittal  of  the  defendant  for  a \ncharged crime. \n \n3.  Information.    Unlike  the  requirements  of  Brady \nand  its  progeny,  which  focus  on  evidence,  the \ndisclosure  requirement  of  this  section  applies  to \ninformation regardless of whether the information \nsubject  to  disclosure  would  itself  constitute \nadmissible evidence. \n \n4.  Cumulative  impact  of  items  of  information.  \nWhile items of information viewed in isolation may \nnot  reasonably  be  seen  as  meeting  the  standards \noutlined in paragraphs 1 and 2 above, several items \n  105\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 124 of 131 PageID #: 740\n \ntogether can have such an effect.  If this is the case, \nall such items must be disclosed. \n \nUSAM § 9-5.001(C). \n \nPreface:    The  following  policy  is  established  for  … \n“investigative agencies”….  It addresses their disclosure \nof potential impeachment information to the United States \nAttorneys’  Offices  and  Department  of  Justice  litigating \nsections with authority to prosecute criminal cases….  The \npurposes  of  this  policy  are  to  ensure  that  prosecutors \nreceive  sufficient  information  to  meet  their  obligations \nunder Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972), and to \nensure that trials are fair…. \n \nThe  exact  parameters  of  potential  impeachment \ninformation  are  not  easily  determined.    Potential \nimpeachment  information,  however,  has  been  generally \ndefined as impeaching information which is material to \nthe defense.  It also includes information that either casts a \nsubstantial  doubt  upon  the  accuracy  of  any  evidence  – \nincluding witness testimony – the prosecutor intends to \nrely  on  to  prove  an  element  of  any  crime  charged,  or \nmight have a significant bearing on the admissibility of \nprosecution evidence.  This information may include but \nis not strictly limited to: (a) specific instances of conduct \nof  a  witness  for  the  purpose  of  attacking  the  witness’ \ncredibility or character for truthfulness; (b) evidence in the \nform of opinion or reputation as to a witness’ character for \ntruthfulness;  (c)  prior  inconsistent  statements;  and  (d) \ninformation that may be used to suggest that a witness is \nbiased. \n \nUSAM § 9-5.100. \nIn  United  States  v.  Crozzoli,  698  F.Supp.  430,  436-37  (EDNY  1988) \n(Glasser, J.), the court reasoned: \n  106\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 125 of 131 PageID #: 741\n \n[W]e reject the blanket assertion that Brady imposes no \npretrial obligation on ... the Government ....  We perceive \nthe due process implications of Brady as obligating the \nGovernment to disclose exculpatory information as soon \nas the character of such information is recognized. \n \nCrozzoli, 698 F.Supp. at 436, quoting, United States v. Mitchell, 372 F.Supp. 1239, \n1257 (SDNY 1973) (emphasis in original).   \nAs  another  District  Court  judge  recognized,  “[I]f  exculpatory  evidence  is \nproduced  for  the  first  time  at  trial,  the  defendant  may  not  have  an  adequate \nopportunity  to  effectively  utilize  the  material,  particularly  if  it  points  to  the \nexistence of other evidence helpful to the defendant.”  United States v. Goldman, \n439 F.Supp. 337, 349 (SDNY 1977) (Duffy, J.); see also United States v. Pollack, \n534 F.2d 964, 973 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (disclosure “must be made at such time as to \nallow the defense to use the favorable material effectively in the preparation and \npresentation of its case”); United States v. Deutsch, 373 F.Supp. 289, 290 (SDNY \n1983)  (“[i]t  should  be  obvious  to  anyone  involved  with  criminal  trials  that \nexculpatory information may come too late if it is given only at trial”). \n   We acknowledge that in Coppa, 267 F.3d at 146, the Second Circuit limited \nearly Giglio discovery to impeachment evidence that is material to the offense.  \nHowever, we note that more recently the Second Circuit expanded its definition of \n“materiality” when it reversed a conviction, holding, “Where suppressed evidence is \ninculpatory as well as exculpatory, and ‘its exculpatory character harmonize[s] with \n  107\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 126 of 131 PageID #: 742\n \nthe theory of the defense case,’ a Brady violation has occurred.”  United States v. \nMahaffy, supra, 693 F.3d 113, 130 (2d Cir. 2012) (emphasis added).20 \nThe  foregoing  analysis  forecloses  the  argument  that  evidence,  which  is \nsimilarly discoverable under both Brady and the Jencks Act, may be withheld until \ntrial; the timing of discovery under the Jencks Act certainly does not trump the \nobligations imposed as a matter of due process under Brady/Giglio.  See Coppa, 267 \nF.3d at 146 (holding that notwithstanding the Jenks Act the pertinent question is \nwhether the “impeachment evidence … r[o]se to the level of materiality prescribed \nby Agurs and Bagley”); see also United States v. McVeigh, 923 F.Supp. 1310, 1315 \n(D.Colo. 1996) (duty to turn over exculpatory and impeachment information under \nBrady neither altered nor modified by fact that information is contained in witness \nstatements  or  grand  jury  testimony,  “Therefore,  such  statements  should  now  be \nprovided.”).  Similarly, in United States v. Persico 164 F.3d 796 (2d Cir. 1999), the \nSecond Circuit held that all Brady material – including that required to be disclosed \nby Giglio – must be disclosed before entry of a pretrial guilty plea: \nRule 32(e) allows a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea \nbefore  sentencing  for  “any  fair  and  just  reason.”    The \nGovernment’s  obligation  to  disclose  Brady  materials  is \npertinent  to  the  accused’s  decision  to  plead  guilty;  the \ndefendant  is  entitled  to  make  that  decision  with  full \n                                                 \n20    This principle also militates in favor or disclosure under 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(f), 1806(g), as \nit is extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible, for a court to recognize how evidence possesses an \nexculpatory character because it “harmonizes with the defense theory of the case.”  That is the \nfunction of defense counsel. \n  108\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 127 of 131 PageID #: 743\n \nawareness  of  favorable  (exculpatory  and  impeachment) \nevidence known to the Government. \n \n164 F.3d at 804 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).  If Brady/Giglio disclosure is \nrequired prior to a plea, at least absent a waiver, then certainly it is required before a \ntrial when no waiver has, or likely ever would, occur. \n  Finally, we note that this Court has the inherent authority to order discovery \nbeyond the bounds of the discovery rules, and as such this Court need not confine \nitself  to  Jenks  Act  or  other  discovery  rules  when  it  comes  to  scheduling  the \nGovernment’s disclosure requirements.  See United States v. Beckford, 962 F.Supp. \n748, 755 (E.D.Va. 1997) (collecting cases); see also United States v. Perez, 222 \nF.Supp.2d 164, 171 (D.Conn. 2002) (recognizing the court’s authority to order early \ndiscovery through its “inherent power to manage its docket and provide for the \norderly and timely disposition of cases”); cf. United States v. Feliciano, 998 F.Supp. \n166, 170 (D.Conn. 1998) (“Rule 16 is ‘intended to prescribe the minimum amount \nof discovery to which the parties are entitled.  It is not intended to limit the judge’s \ndiscretion to order broader discovery in appropriate cases.”), citing, Fed.R.Crim.P. \n16, Advisory Committee Note. \nHere, Hasbajrami is charged in a four-count indictment, involving extremely \nserious offenses.  Hasbajrami’s prosecution has also taken on considerable national \n– and international – attention due to the unique legal issues involved in this case.  \nSee, e.g., Charlie Savage, Justice Dept. Informs Inmate of Pre-Arrest Surveillance, \n  109\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 128 of 131 PageID #: 744\n \nN.Y.  Times,  Feb.  25,  2014;  Andrew  Keshner,  Terrorism  Suspect  Allowed  to \nWithdraw Guilty Plea, N.Y. Law Journal, Oct. 6, 2014; Albanian man can withdraw \nterror plea over warrantless surveillance, The Guardian, Oct. 6. 2014.  \nAccordingly, we respectfully submit that all Brady material, including Giglio \nmaterial,  should  be  disclosed  immediately  to  the  defense,  particularly  if  it \n“harmonize[s] with” the Government’s understanding of “the theory of the defense \ncase.”  Mahaffy, 693 F.3d at 130. \nTenth Motion \nMOTION  FOR  EARLY  DISCLOSURE  OF  3500 \nMATERIAL               \n \nFor similar reasons as those outlined in Defendant’s Ninth Motion, supra, the \ndefense requests a court order directing the Government to provide early disclosure \nof 3500 material.  To that end the defense requests that 3500 material be produced \nat least 30 days prior to trial.  There exists a unique pubic importance to this case \nand the discovery thus far disclosed is both voluminous and complex.  As such, we \nrespectfully submit that early production of 3500 material will help ensure that no \nunnecessarily delays occur that might derail a timely and efficient trial. \n  110\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 129 of 131 PageID #: 745\n \nEleventh Motion \n \nMOTION  FOR  NOTICE  OF  EVIDENCE  THE \nGOVERNMENT  INTENDS  TO  OFFER  UNDER \nFED.R.EVID. 404(b)             \n \nFed.R.Evid. 404(b) requires the Government, upon request of the defense, to \nprovide pretrial notice of evidence it intends to offer under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b).  We \ncall upon the Government to provide such notice, and to do so at least 30 days prior \nto trial. \nV.  Other Motions \nTwelfth Motion \nMOTION  FOR  LEAVE  TO  SUBMIT  FURTHER \nMOTIONS                \n \nDefense counsel have endeavored to bring all unclassified motions applicable \nat this time but request leave to bring any additional motions – classified and/or \nunclassified – which may become necessary based upon the Government’s response \nto  the  present  motions  or  new  facts  uncovered  by  the  defendant’s  ongoing \ninvestigation into this case.   \nSimilarly, and as merely one example, the Government has been ordered to \ncomplete its Section 4, 18 U.S.C. App. 3, applications by January 9, 2015.  Defense \ncounsel reserves the right to file motions, pursuant to Section 5 of the Classified \nInformation Procedures Act, 18 U.S.C. App. 3, at the appropriate time after this \nCourt rules on the Government’s Section 4 applications. \n  111\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 130 of 131 PageID #: 746\n \nAdditionally, Hasbjarami’s FAA and FISA-related suppression motions are \nbased  upon  the  assumptions  that:  (1)  all  of  the  FISA-related  evidence  that  the \nGovernment intends to rely upon at trial was derived either directly or indirectly \nfrom FAA surveillance; and (2) that no argument will be raised by the Government \nthat  certain  of  its  evidence  was  sufficiently  attenuated  or  derived  from  an \nindependent source.   \nDefense counsel base these assumptions on the Government’s Supplemental \nNotice, dated, February 24, 2014, as well as arguments made during oral argument \non September 12, 2014, which were had in relationship to Hasbajrami’s Section \n2255 and Rule 33-related discovery motions (see ecf #76).  See, e.g., Gov’t Sup. \nNotice, dated, February 24, 2014 (ecf #65), at 1 (the Government providing notice \nto Hasbajrami that “evidence and information, obtained or derived from Title I or III \nFISA collection, that the government intended to offer into evidence or otherwise \nuse or disclose in proceedings in this case was derived from acquisition of foreign \nintelligence information conducted pursuant to the FAA”).   \nTo  the  extent,  however,  that  the  Government’s  response  to  the  present \nsuppression  motions  raises  –  now  for  the  first  time  –  the  attenuation  and/or \nindependent source doctrines, then we respectfully submit leave to file additional \nFISA motions, including, suppression motions based upon, for example,.50 U.S.C. \n§ 1805(a). \n  112\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 92   Filed 11/26/14   Page 131 of 131 PageID #: 747\n \nConclusion \nWHEREFORE, Defendant Agron Hasbajrami, by and through his attorneys, \nrespectfully moves for the relief set forth herein, and for such other and further \nrelief as this Court may deem just and proper. \nDated:  New York, New York \n  November 26, 2014 \n   \n              Respectfully submitted, \n               \n              Michael K.

The defendant was sentenced on January 8,\n2013 on his plea of guilty to attempting to provide material support to terrorists. He has\nnot ﬁled a notice of appeal. I have received a letter dated October 4, 2013 from the\ndefendant demanding certain discovery, including grand jury transcripts, the \"criminal\ncomplain[t]\" and other documents.The defendant's plea of guilty has extinguished his\nright to the discovery he seeks. A couple of the requested documents -- the docket sheet\nand the transcript of the sentencing proceeding -- are readily obtainable and ought in\nfairness to be provided to him, but I see neither an entitlement to the others or a\njustiﬁcation for directing the government to provide them. Accordingly, the government is\nordered to send a copy of the docket sheet and the sentencing transcript to Hasbajrami on\nor before November 1, 2013 and to ﬁle a letter conﬁrming its compliance with that order\nby that date.

Without\nexpressing any view on whether Mr. Hasbajrami did in fact submit the motion previously,\nthe Court invites Mr. Hasbajrami to submit the motion again.

Box 420 \nFairton, NJ 08320 \n \nRe:  Agron Hasbajrami v. United States \n  Crim. Docket No. 11-623 (S1)(JG)    \n \nDear Mr. Hasbajrami: \n \nThe government submits this letter to supplement the government’s original \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”) notice, which was filed on September 13, \n2011.  The original FISA notice advised you that the government intended to offer into \nevidence, or otherwise use or disclose “information obtained or derived from electronic \nsurveillance and physical searches conducted pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act of 1978 (‘FISA’), as amended, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1812 and 1821-1829.” \n(Dckt. # 9).  Electronic surveillance under these provisions is commonly referred to as Title I \ncollection, while physical search is commonly referred to as Title III collection. \nWe write to supplement the original notice by informing you that, pursuant to \n50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(c) and 1881e(a), the government intended to offer into evidence or otherwise \nuse or disclose in proceedings in the above-captioned matter information derived from \nacquisition of foreign intelligence information conducted pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act of 1978, as amended, 50 U.S.C. § 1881a.  This supplemental notification is \nbased on a recent determination by the government that certain evidence or information \nobtained or derived from Title I and Title III FISA collection in this case was itself also \nderived from other collection pursuant to Title VII of FISA as to which you were aggrieved.  \nTitle VII of FISA, enacted pursuant to the FISA Amendments Act (“FAA”), permits, among \nother things, the targeting of electronic communications of non-U.S. persons located outside \nthe United States, subject to certain statutory requirements.  See 50 U.S.C. §1881a.  \nAccordingly, we write to inform you that certain evidence and information, obtained or \nderived from Title I or III FISA collection, that the government intended to offer into \nevidence or otherwise use or disclose in proceedings in this case was derived from \nacquisition of foreign intelligence information conducted pursuant to the FAA. \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-JG   Document 65   Filed 02/24/14   Page 2 of 2 PageID #: 389\nIn the government’s view, this supplemental notification does not afford you a \nbasis to withdraw your plea or to otherwise attack your conviction or sentence because you \nexpressly waived those rights, as well as the right to any additional disclosures from the \ngovernment, in your plea agreement.  Nevertheless, because you currently have a pending \nhabeas petition in civil case number 13-6852 (JG), by which you are seeking to vacate your \nconviction on other grounds, the government does not oppose modifying the existing briefing \nschedule to permit you to amend your submission before the government files its response if \nyou wish to do so.  If you do not wish to amend your submission, the government will \nrespond to the pending petition on or before February 28, 2014, as is currently scheduled. \n  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nLORETTA E.

IRIZARRY, Chief U.S. District Judge: \nBefore the Court is Agron Hasbajrami’s (“Defendant”) motion to release to his counsel an \nunredacted version of the Memorandum (“Unredacted Opinion”) issued on February 18, 2016, by \nthe Hon. John Gleeson, U.S.D.J. (retired) denying Defendant’s motion to suppress the fruits of \nelectronic surveillance conducted under Section 702 of the FISA1 Amendments Act (“FAA”), \ncodified at 50 U.S.C. 50 U.S.C. § 1881a (“Section 702”).  Judge Gleeson posted a redacted version \n(“Redacted Opinion”) of the Unredacted Opinion on the public docket on March 8, 2016.  (See \nRedacted Opinion, Dkt. Entry No. 165; Mem. of L. in Supp. of Def’s. Mot. to Release (“Def’s. \nMem.”), Dkt. Entry No. 168.)  The government opposes the release of the Unredacted Opinion.  \n(See Gov’s. Mem. of L. in Opp. (“Gov’s. Opp’n”), Dkt. Entry No. 169.)  For the reasons set forth \nbelow, Defendant’s motion is denied.  \nBACKGROUND \nThe Court assumes the parties’ familiarity with the factual and procedural history of this \ncase, as set forth in the Redacted Opinion, and will relate only those facts relevant to deciding the \nmotion.  (See Redacted Opinion, at 3-5.)  A brief summary of the case as it relates to this decision \nfollows below.   \n                                                           \n1 FISA refers to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, 50 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq, which was amended on \nJuly 10, 2008.  \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 171   Filed 04/06/17   Page 2 of 14 PageID #: 1786\nOn September 6, 2011, Joint Terrorism Task Force (“JTTF”) agents arrested Defendant at \nJohn F. Kennedy International Airport, in New York, as he was about to board a flight to Turkey.  \n(Id. at 3.)  After his arraignment, the government notified Defendant that it intended to use at trial \ninformation derived pursuant to surveillance and physical searches conducted under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (“FISA”).  (Id. at 3-4.)  On April 12, 2012, Defendant pled \nguilty to providing material support to terrorists, and, on January 8, 2013, Judge Gleeson sentenced \nhim to a 180-month term of imprisonment.  (Id. at 4.)  \nIn July 2013, Defendant filed a motion to vacate his conviction under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.  \n(Id.)  On February 24, 2015, the government informed Defendant “that certain evidence or \ninformation, obtained or derived from Title I or III FISA collection, . . . was derived from \nacquisition of foreign intelligence information conducted pursuant to the FAA.”  (Id. quoting Dkt. \nEntry No. 65.)  Defendant moved to withdraw his guilty plea.  Based on the government’s \ndisclosure, Judge Gleeson allowed Defendant to withdraw his guilty plea and challenge the \nconstitutionality of the intelligence collected pursuant to the FAA and seek its suppression.  (Id. at \n5.)  In vacating Defendant’s guilty plea, Judge Gleeson concluded that Defendant “was not \nsufficiently informed about the facts. . . .  [and Defendant] could not have made an intelligent \ndecision about whether to plead guilty.”  (Id. n. 3 quoting Dkt. Entry No. 85, at 6.)  Specifically, \nJudge Gleeson found that, “[w]hen the government provided FISA notice without FAA notice, \nHasbajrami was misled about an important aspect of his case.”  (Id.)  \nOn November 26, 2014, Defendant filed his motion to suppress the evidence derived \npursuant to the FAA.  (Id. at 5.)  On February 20, 2015, after hearing oral argument, Judge Gleeson \ndenied Defendant’s suppression motion and subsequently set forth his reasoning in the Unredacted \nOpinion and Redacted Opinion.  (See generally, Redacted Opinion.)  On June 26, 2015, Defendant \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 171   Filed 04/06/17   Page 3 of 14 PageID #: 1787\npled guilty to one count of attempt to provide material support to terrorists and one count of \nconspiracy to provide material support to terrorists; and, on August 13, 2015, Judge Gleeson \nsentenced Defendant to a 192-month term of imprisonment.  (Id. at 5.)    \nOn February 23, 2016, Judge Gleeson delivered the Unredacted Opinion to the Classified \nInformation Officer.  (See February 23, 2016, ECF Order.)  The Redacted Opinion was served on \nall the parties on February 25, 2016, and was filed on the docket on March 8, 2016.  (See February \n25, 2016, ECF Order; March 8, 2016, ECF Order.)  The Redacted Opinion contained “several \ninstances . . . where language ha[d] been substituted, and two instances where language ha[d] been \nredacted.”  (March 8, 2016, ECF Order.)  Judge Gleeson denied Defendant’s motion to suppress \nthe  fruits  of  electronic  surveillance  obtained  pursuant  to  Section  702  and  found  that  the \ngovernment’s surveillance of Defendant was lawful and complied with the Fourth Amendment.  \n(See generally Redacted Opinion, at 5-25.)  Judge Gleeson also denied Defendant’s request for \ndiscovery of the classified materials relating to the Section 702 and FISA authorizations and \ncollection of information.  (Id. at 26-27.)   \nSubsequently, Defendant filed an appeal with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which \ncurrently is stayed.  (See Dkt. Entry No. 155.)  On July 25, 2016, Defendant filed the present \nmotion seeking the release of the Unredacted Opinion to his counsel in order to “have his appeal \nheard on a level playing field.”  (Def’s. Mem. at 1.)  The Unredacted Opinion references classified \ninformation submitted by the government with its opposition to Defendant’s motion to suppress.2    \n \n \n                                                           \n2 Throughout this Court’s decision, the “discussion of the classified information is necessarily circumspect[.]”  United \nStates v. Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d 102, 141 (2d Cir. 2010). \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 171   Filed 04/06/17   Page 4 of 14 PageID #: 1788\n \nDISCUSSION \nI.  FISA’s Procedures and Legal Framework3  \nIn 1978, Congress enacted FISA to govern foreign intelligence surveillance and searches.  \n50 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq.  FISA created the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (“FISA Court”), \nwhich reviews the government’s applications for surveillance orders “for the purpose of obtaining \nforeign intelligence information.”  Id. §§ 1802(b); 1803.  “Unlike ordinary Article III courts, the \n[FISA Court] conducts its usually ex parte proceedings in secret; its decisions are not, in the \nordinary course, disseminated publicly.”  Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Clapper, 785 F.3d 787, 793 \n(2d Cir. 2015).  The FISA Court may issue a FISA warrant where there is probable cause to believe \nthat the target of the surveillance “is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power” and that the \n“facilities or places” at which the surveillance is directed are “being used, or . . . about to be used, \nby a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.” Id. § 1805(a)(2)(A)-(B). The FISA Court’s \nrulings are reviewed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review.  Id. § 1803(b).   \nIn 2008, Congress enacted the FAA, which “left much of FISA intact, but . . . ‘established \na  new  and  independent  source  of  intelligence  collection  authority,  beyond  that  granted  in \ntraditional FISA.’”  Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 133 S. Ct. 1138, 1144 (2013) (internal citation \nomitted); 50 U.S.C. § 1881a.  Section 702 of the FAA, “supplements pre-existing FISA authority \nby  creating  a  new  framework  under  which  the  Government  may  seek  the  [FISA  Court’s] \nauthorization of certain foreign intelligence surveillance targeting the communications of non-U.S. \npersons located abroad.”  Id.  Section 702 differs from the “traditional FISA,” in part, because it \ndoes not require that the government show “probable cause that the target of the electronic \n                                                           \n3 The Redacted Opinion describes the history of FISA and the FISA Amendments in-depth.  (See Redacted Opinion \nat 6-13.) \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 171   Filed 04/06/17   Page 5 of 14 PageID #: 1789\nsurveillance is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power.”  Id.   Instead, the FISA Court approves \ncertifications provided by the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence that \nauthorize the acquisition of foreign intelligence information when the certifications comply with \nthe statute.  50 U.S.C. §§ 1881a(a), (i)(3). \nWhen the government intends to use or disclose information obtained or derived from \ntraditional FISA or Section 702 surveillance, it must provide a defendant with notice, and the \ndefendant may challenge the lawfulness of the acquisition with a motion to suppress.  50 U.S.C. \n§§ 1806(c), 1806(e), 1881e(a).  If a defendant makes a motion to suppress FISA or Section 702 \nmaterial, the Attorney General may submit “an affidavit under oath that disclosure or an adversary \nhearing would harm the national security of the United States.”  Id. §§ 1806(f), 1825(g).  The \ndistrict court then reviews “in camera and ex parte the application, order, and such other materials \nrelating to the surveillance as may be necessary to determine whether the surveillance of the \naggrieved person was lawfully authorized and conducted.”  Id.  After its review, a court “may \ndisclose to the aggrieved person, under appropriate security procedures and protective orders, \nportions of the application, order, or other materials relating to the surveillance only where such \ndisclosure is necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance.”  Id.  \nIf the surveillance was lawful, “it shall deny the motion of the aggrieved person except to the extent \nthat due process requires discovery or disclosure.”  Id. §§ 1806(g), 1825(h). \nA.  FISA Forecloses the Release of the Unredacted Opinion  \nDefendant asserts that the Court should disclose the Unredacted Opinion to his defense \ncounsel because ex parte proceedings are “exceedingly disfavored,” Def’s. Mem. at 6, and \ndisclosure would level the “unlevel playing field” where “only the government knows the facts \nspecific to the FAA electronic surveillance and interception with respect to [Defendant].”  (Id. at \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 171   Filed 04/06/17   Page 6 of 14 PageID #: 1790\n4-5.)  While generally, “ex parte proceedings are anathema in our system of justice,” Guenther v. \nC.I.R., 889 F.2d 882, 884 (9th Cir. 1989), FISA makes clear that only the government and the \nCourt are entitled to certain facts specific to the electronic surveillance of a defendant obtained \npursuant to said statute and its amendments.  See United States v. Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d 102, 129 \n(2d  Cir.  2010)  (“[D]isclosure  of  FISA  materials  is  the  exception  and  ex  parte,  in  camera \ndetermination is the rule.”) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).  However, the Court \nmay order disclosure to a defendant “only where such disclosure is necessary to make an accurate \ndetermination of the legality of the surveillance” or “to the extent that due process requires.”  50 \nU.S.C. §§ 1806(f), (g). These provisions allow for Defendant’s participation when necessary and \nprevent the unnecessary release of foreign intelligence information that could compromise national \nsecurity.  See generally United States v. Belfield, 692 F.2d 141, 148 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (In FISA, \n“Congress recognized the need for the Executive to engage in and employ the fruits of clandestine \nsurveillance without being constantly hamstrung by disclosure requirements”). \nHere, Defendant’s counsel are not entitled to view the Unredacted Opinion because \nreleasing it would reveal classified foreign intelligence information and circumvent FISA by \nundermining the purpose of section 1806(f).  Before Judge Gleeson, Defendant “moved for \ndiscovery  of  the  classified  materials  relating  to  Section  702  and  FISA  authorizations  and \ncollection.”  (Redacted Opinion at 26.)  As required by FISA section 1806(f), Judge Gleeson \n“careful[ly] review[ed]” the FISA and Section 702 materials and held, that he “was able to evaluate \nthe legality of the challenged surveillance without concluding that due process first warranted \ndisclosure.”  (Id.)  By seeking to view the Unredacted Opinion, which references classified \ninformation, Defendant’s attorneys improperly attempt to access the same classified information \nJudge Gleeson found they were not entitled to obtain.   \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 171   Filed 04/06/17   Page 7 of 14 PageID #: 1791\nThe fact that counsel now seek the classified information for purposes of an appeal is \ninconsequential.  FISA does not mandate disclosure in order to help defendants make an appeal.  \nIf it did, section 1806(f) would be meaningless because defendants would obtain classified \ninformation simply by appealing every negative section 1806(f) ruling.  See generally Belfield, \n692 F.2d at 146 (“Congress was adamant in enacting FISA that the ‘carefully drawn procedures’ \nof this section are not to be ‘bypassed by the inventive litigant using a new statute, rule or judicial \nconstruction.’”) (internal citation omitted). \nDefendant also contends that access to the Unredacted Opinion is appropriate because ex \nparte proceedings “with respect to appeals . . . present an overwhelming danger of erroneous \ndecisions”  since  the  Second  Circuit  cannot  “properly  function  as  [Defendant’s]  surrogate \nadvocate,” Def’s. Mem. at 12, and [s]uch a “system does not provide Due Process, or even \napproach it.” (Reply Mem. of L. in Supp. of Def’s. Mot. to Release (“Def’s. Reply”), Dkt. Entry \nNo. 170, at 4.)  Second Circuit precedent forecloses these arguments.   \nIn analyzing FISA, the “Second Circuit has made clear that proceeding ex parte does not, \nstanding alone, offend notions of fundamental fairness.”  United States v. Medunjanin, 2012 WL \n526428, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 16, 2012) (collecting cases).  In Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d at 129, the \nSecond Circuit conducted its “own review” of the classified materials and “identif[ied] no denial \nof due process in the district court’s decision” that “disclosure and an adversary hearing were \nunnecessary because . . . the requirements of due process did not counsel otherwise.”  Id.  Similarly, \nin United States v. Stewart, 590 F.3d 93, 129 (2d Cir. 2009), the Second Circuit also reviewed the \nclassified materials and held that “there was no error in the district court’s determination that \ndisclosure was unnecessary . . . to satisfy the requirements of due process.” Id.  Therefore, \n“[t]hough  the  court  is  mindful  of  the  difficulties  that  defense  counsel  must  face  in  such \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 171   Filed 04/06/17   Page 8 of 14 PageID #: 1792\ncircumstances, the FISA procedures are in place in the interest of national security.”  United States \nv. Fishenko, 2014 WL 4804215, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 25, 2014).  These ex parte procedures do \nnot violate Defendant’s due process rights.  \nDefendant further argues that, without access to the redacted portions of the Redacted \nOpinion, his ability “to establish non-compliance with the strictures of § 1881a” is impaired.  \n(Def’s. Mem. at 9.) 4  Defendant’s argument misconstrues the statute.  FISA states that, if “the \nUnited States district court . . . determines that the surveillance was not lawfully authorized or \nconducted, it shall . . . suppress the evidence[.]”  50 U.S.C § 1806(g).  FISA’s framework mandates \nthat the Court, and not Defendant, evaluate the legality of the surveillance by reviewing the \nsurveillance materials.  Id. § 1806(f).  In conducting its review of the materials, the Court discloses \ninformation to a defendant only when it is “necessary” for the Court to reach an “accurate \ndetermination” of the government’s compliance with the statute.  Id.  Here, Judge Gleeson found \nthat disclosure was not necessary  “to evaluate the legality of the  challenged surveillance.”  \n(Redacted Opinion at 26.)  Therefore, unless this Court disagrees with Judge Gleeson’s holding, \nDefendant cannot support his non-compliance arguments, before either this Court or the Court of \nAppeals, by relying on surveillance materials that he is not entitled to examine.  See United States \nv. Medunjanin, 2012 WL 526428, at *10 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 16, 2012) (“Defense counsel, however, \nmay not inspect the FISA dockets to construct a better argument for inspecting the FISA dockets. \nSuch a circular exercise would be patently inconsistent with FISA and unjustified by the facts \npresented.”).  That principle applies regardless of whether the classified materials are referenced \n                                                           \n4 In denying Defendant’s discovery requests to obtain the classified information, Judge Gleeson considered this and \nmany of the arguments made in Defendant’s current motion.  Defendant cannot circumvent the statute by \nrepackaging rejected arguments and reasserting them against the redacted portions of a judicial opinion containing \nthe same confidential information Judge Gleeson held Defendant was not entitled to obtain.  (Compare Def’s. Mem. \nat 9 with Dkt. Entry No. 92 at 74-75 and Def’s. Mem. at 5-6 with Dkt. Entry No. 92 at 42-43.)  Nonetheless, out of \nan abundance of caution, the Court has considered these arguments specifically as they relate to withholding content \nin a judicial opinion.   \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 171   Filed 04/06/17   Page 9 of 14 PageID #: 1793\nin an ex parte submission or in a court’s redacted judicial opinion.   \nAs discussed above, consistent with FISA, Defendant’s counsel may access the classified \ninformation contained in the Unredacted Opinion only if this Court disagrees either with Judge \nGleeson’s section 1806(f) analysis or with Judge Gleeson’s conclusion that due process did not \nrequire disclosure.  See 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(f), (g).  Since Defendant has not filed a motion for \nreconsideration, there is no reason to revisit Judge Gleeson’s holdings.  Accordingly, Judge \nGleeson’s holdings are the “law of the case,” and this Court will adhere to the law of the case \ndoctrine and not second guess Judge Gleeson’s conclusions.  See Johnson v. Holder, 564 F.3d 95, \n99 (2d Cir. 2009) (“The law of the case doctrine commands that ‘when a court has ruled on an \nissue, that decision should generally be adhered to by that court in subsequent stages in the same \ncase’ unless ‘cogent and compelling reasons militate otherwise.’”) (internal citation omitted).  \nII.  CIPA’s Procedures and Legal Framework \nThe  Classified  Information  Procedures  Act  (“CIPA”)  “establishes  rules  for  the \nmanagement of criminal cases involving classified information.”  In re Terrorist Bombings of U.S. \nEmbassies in E. Africa, 552 F.3d 93, 115 (2d Cir. 2008).  CIPA “is designed ‘to protect[ ] and \nrestrict[ ] the discovery of classified information in a way that does not impair the defendant’s \nright to a fair trial.’”  Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d at 140 (internal citation omitted).  “CIPA does not \nconfer on the government a privilege to refrain from disclosing classified information; it merely \npresupposes one.”  Id.   \nSection 3 of CIPA requires a district court to issue, upon “motion of the United States,” a \nprotective order “protect[ing] against the disclosure of any classified information disclosed by the \nUnited States to any defendant.”  18 U.S.C. § app. 3 § 3.  Section 4 establishes the procedures for \nthe “[d]iscovery of classified information by defendants.”  18 U.S.C. app. 3 § 4.  This provision \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 171   Filed 04/06/17   Page 10 of 14 PageID #: 1794\n“provides that, if the discovery to be provided to the defense pursuant to the Federal Rules of \nCriminal Procedure includes classified information, the district court may, ‘upon a sufficient \nshowing, . . . authorize the United States to delete specified items of classified information[,] . . . \nto substitute a summary of the information[,] . . . or to substitute a statement admitting relevant \nfacts that the classified information would tend to prove.’”  In re Terrorist Bombings of U.S. \nEmbassies in E. Africa, 552 F.3d at 116 (quoting 18 U.S.C. app. 3 § 4.)   \n“CIPA’s framework for nondisclosure provides a means for applying the state-secrets \nprivilege to classified information which, in ordinary circumstances, would be discoverable.  \nProper application of that privilege requires balancing of the government’s need to protect national \nsecurity with the right of a defendant to mount a full defense.”  United States v. Boulos, 2015 WL \n502170, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 3, 2015) (internal citation omitted).  In determining whether a \ndefendant’s right to present a defense supplants the state secrets privilege, the Second Circuit \napplies the test announced in Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 77 (1957).  Abu-Jihaad, 630 \nF.3d at 141.   \nUnder the test, the “district court must first decide whether the classified information the \nGovernment possesses is discoverable” and if it is “whether the state-secrets privilege applies \nbecause: (1) there is ‘a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose . . . matters \nwhich, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged,’ and (2) the privilege is ‘lodged \nby the head of the department which has control over the matter, after actual personal consideration \nby that officer.’”  United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 80 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal citation omitted).  \nIf the information is both discoverable and privileged, the district court determines whether the \ninformation “is helpful or material to the defense, i.e., useful ‘to counter the government's case or \nto bolster a defense.’”  Id. (internal citation omitted).  If it is, a court “may permit the government \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 171   Filed 04/06/17   Page 11 of 14 PageID #: 1795\nto produce that information in a form that will preserve its sensitivity (e.g., redacted, summaries, \nfactual stipulations).”  Boulos, 2015 WL 502170, at *2. \nA.  CIPA Governs Discovery From the Government and Not From the Court \nDefendant argues that release of the Unredacted Opinion “can be achieved consistent with \nboth the purpose and procedures of the Classified Information Procedures Act.”  (Def’s. Mem. at \n1)  In opposition, the government contends that disclosure under CIPA is inappropriate because \nCIPA is “a separate and distinct statutory framework that is inapplicable to a district court’s \ndetermination regarding disclosure” under FISA.  (Gov’s. Mem. at 12.)  Both Defendant’s and the \ngovernment’s arguments are misplaced.  CIPA does not compel or regulate the discovery of \nclassified information contained in a court’s written opinion.  Instead, CIPA manages the discovery \nof classified information in the government’s possession by “impos[ing] “upon district courts a \nmandatory duty to guard against the unauthorized ‘disclosure of any classified material disclosed \nby the United States to any defendant in any criminal case.’” In re Terrorist Bombings of U.S. \nEmbassies in E. Africa, 552 F.3d at 121 (quoting 18 U.S.C. app. 3 at § 3) (emphasis added).  \nDefendant’s assertion that CIPA “provides a mechanism for disclosure” of the Unredacted \nOpinion also is meritless.5  Congress designed CIPA’s discovery provisions to “complement” \nthose contained in Rule 16(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.  Id.  Rule 16 specifies \nthe type of information the government must disclose to a defendant and permits a district court to \nrestrict discovery in a criminal case for “good cause.”  Id. (d)(1).  Section 4 of CIPA “clarifies \ndistrict courts’ power under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1) to issue protective orders \ndenying or restricting discovery for good cause, which includes information vital to the national \n                                                           \n5 In his reply, Defendant argues that nothing in CIPA “permits withholding from security-cleared defense counsel \nportions of a court’s opinion – as opposed to discovery.”  (Def’s. Reply at 3). Defendant’s argument misconstrues the \nstatute.  CIPA is a statute that establishes procedures for regulating the disclosure of classified discovery in the \ngovernment’s possession.  It is not designed to mandate that a court apply those procedures to its judicial opinions.    \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 171   Filed 04/06/17   Page 12 of 14 PageID #: 1796\nsecurity.”  Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d at 140.  Congress enacted CIPA “to harmonize a [criminal] \ndefendant’s right to obtain and present exculpatory material with the government’s need to \nwithhold information from discovery when disclosure would be inimical to national security.”  In \nre Terrorist Bombings of U.S. Embassies in E. Africa, 552 F.3d at 115–16.  CIPA was not intended \nto regulate the disclosure of classified information contained in a judicial opinion.  The contrary \nconclusion would create a new discovery right and conflict with well established case law that, \n“CIPA ‘creates no new rights of or limits on discovery of . . . classified information[.]’”  United \nStates v. Babafemi, 2014 WL 1515277, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 18, 2014) (internal citation omitted).  \nB.  Defense Counsels’ Security Clearances Do Not Warrant Disclosure of the Unredacted \nOpinion \nDefendant contends that the Court should grant his counsel access to the Unredacted \nOpinion  because  they  possess  security  clearances  and,  as  a  result,  the  Court  should  allow \nDefendant “the ability to confront the Opinion as it exists in its entirety.”  (Def’s. Mem. at 13.)  \nUnder the applicable Executive Order, defense counsel may access classified information only if \nthey hold both the required clearance and have “a need-to-know the information.”   Exec. Order \nNo. 13,526, 75 Fed. Reg. 707, 720 (Dec. 29, 2009).  Here, the parties dispute whether the Court \nshould make the “need-to-know” determination by relying on CIPA or FISA.  (Compare Gov’s. \nMem. at 14-16, with Def’s. Reply at 4-5.)  Because Judge Gleeson conducted his review of the \nclassified materials by relying on FISA, the Court holds that FISA determines whether or not \nDefendant’s attorneys have a “need-to-know” the contents of the Unredacted Opinion.  To rely on \nCIPA, after Judge Gleeson made his findings pursuant to FISA, would permit Defendant to \nchallenge the FISA ruling denying him access to classified information by mandating access to the \nsame information under CIPA.  This approach would frustrate the purposes underlying both \nstatutes.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 171   Filed 04/06/17   Page 13 of 14 PageID #: 1797\nApplying  FISA, defense counsel  do not have  a “need-to-know” the contents of the \nUnredacted Opinion.  The reach of counsels’ security clearances is not unlimited and those \n“clearances do not mandate . . . access to immaterial classified information for which counsel has \nno legitimate need.”  United States v. Zazi, 2011 WL 2532903, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. June 24, 2011).  \nAs discussed above, FISA warrants disclosure of classified information either when necessary to \ndeterminate the legality of the surveillance or when required by due process.  50 U.S.C. § 1806 \n(f)-(g).  Judge Gleeson held that he “was able to evaluate the legality of the challenged surveillance \nwithout concluding that due process first warranted disclosure.”  (Redacted Opinion at 26.)  \nAdditionally, Judge Gleeson found that, because the information was lawfully acquired “disclosure \nof the materials to the defendant [was] unnecessary.”  (Id. at 27.)  This Court will not reevaluate \nJudge Gleeson’s holding.  Accordingly, because Defendant’s counsel are not entitled to the \nclassified information under FISA, they do not “need-to-know” the classified information redacted \nin the Redacted Opinion.  \nEven if the Court applied CIPA, defense counsel would not “need-to-know” the redacted \ncontents in the Redacted Opinion because the redacted information is not “helpful or material to \nthe defense.”  Aref, 533 F.3d at 80.  The redacted content neither facilitates “counter[ing] the \ngovernment’s case” nor “bolster[s] a defense.”  Id.  To the contrary, the reacted portions of the \nRedacted Opinion tend to inculpate Defendant further in the charged crimes.  It is also notable that \nthe redacted portions constitute only three lines in a twenty-seven page opinion.  For all these \nreasons, disclosure is not warranted. \n \n \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 171   Filed 04/06/17   Page 14 of 14 PageID #: 1798\nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, Defendant’s motion to release the Unredacted Opinion to \nhis security cleared counsel is denied in its entirety.    \nSO ORDERED.   \n \nDated:  Brooklyn, New York \n April 6, 2017 \n  ______________/s/______________ \nDORA L.

Kennedy  International  Airport \nin  September  2011  and  charged  with  attempting  to  provide  material  support  to  a \nterrorist  organization.  After  he  pleaded  guilty,  the  government  disclosed,  for  the \nfirst  time,  that  certain  evidence  involved  in  Hasbajrami’s  arrest  and  prosecution \nhad  been  derived  from  information  obtained  by  the  government  without a \nwarrant  pursuant  to  its  warrantless  surveillance  program  under  Section  702  of \nthe  FISA  Amendments  Act  of  2008.  Hasbajrami  then  withdrew  his  initial  plea \nEO  PEaS   oPyS   PEoYR  S  aPeSre s  oMe s  ns SRE  Apoa s a &  ey,  “ig ~, \nRaw  feet  et  §  ENP  E  Se  BES  Sof  PASE  ON  n\nae  doa Pages se  3 \nand  moved  to  suppress  any  fruits  of  the  Section  702  surveillance.  The  district \ncourt  (Gleeson,  then-j.)  denied  the  motion  to  suppress  and  Hasbajrami  again \npleaded  guilty,  this  time  pursuant  to  a  conditional  guilty  plea  that  allowed  him \nto  appeal  the  district  court’s  ruling  denying  his  motion  to  suppress. \nHe  now  appeals,  arguing  inter  alia  that  the  warranUess  surveillance  and \nthe  collection  of  his  communications  violated  the  Fourth  Amendment.  We \nconclude  that  the  collection  of  the  communications  of  United  States  persons \nincidental  to  the  lawful!  surveillance  of  non-United  States  persons  located  abroad \ndoes  not  violate  the  Fourth  Amendment  and  that,  to  the  extent  that  the \ngovernment's  inadvertent  targeting  of  a  United  States  person  led  to  collection  of \nHasbajrami’s  communications,  he  was  not  harmed  by  that  collection.  aaa \nBe  Because  there  is  insufficient information \nin  either  the  classified  or  the  public  record  in  this  case  to  permit  us  to  determine \nwhether  any  such  querying  was  reasonable,  and  therefore  permissible  under  the \nFourth  Amendment,  we  REMAND  the  case  to  the  district  court  for  further \nproceedings  consistent  with  this  opinion. \n  \nMICHAEL  K.

LYNCH,  Circuit Judge: \nThis  case  concerns  the  Fourth  Amendment  implications  of  the \ngovernment's  increasing  technological  capacity  for  electronic  surveillance  in \nforeign  intelligence  and  terrorism  investigations,  and  the  balance  our \nconstitutional  system  requires  between  national  security  and  individual  privacy. \nOn  September  6,  2011,  Defendant-Appellant Agron  Hasbajrami \n(“Hasbajrami”)  was  arrested  as  he  attempted  to  board  a  flight  to  Turkey  at  John \nF.  Kennedy  International  Airport  in  Queens,  New  York.  His  luggage  contained  a \ntent,  boots,  and  cold-weather  gear.  The  government,  which  had  collected \nHasbajrami‘s  electronic  communications,  charged  him  with  attempting  to \nprovide  material  support  to  a  terrorist organization,  alleging  that  he  intended  to \ntravel  to  the  Federally  Administered  Tribal  Area  of  Pakistan,  where  he  expected \nto join  a  terrorist  organization,  receive  training,  and  ultimately  fight  “against U.S. \nforces  and  others  in  Afghanistan  and  Pakistan.”  App’x  at  44.  During  the  course \nof  the prosecution,  the  government disclosed  that  it  had  collected  some  of  its\nRoeR eYtaPE  ITGgal hu beBwO SRSMswA eaSeHcS  iTT RLEDN   SwTEiGe,    QDSSa iSrs o k  laf\nevidence  under  the  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Act  of  1978  (“FISA”),  Pub. \nL.  No.  95-511,  92  Stat.  1783  (1978),  codified  at  50  U.S.C.  §  1801  et  seq.,  and  that  it \nintended  to  introduce  FISA-derived  evidence  at  any  eventual  trial.  Faced  with \nthe  evidence,  including  his  own  incriminating  communications,  Hasbajrami \nultimately  pleaded  guilty  to  attempting  to  provide  material  support  to  terrorists \nin  violation  of  18  U.S.C.  §  2339A.  He  was  sentenced  to  180  months  in  prison. \nHasbajrami  was  already  serving  his  sentence  when  the  government \nprovided  him  with  a  supplemental  letter  disclosing,  for  the  first  time,  that  some \nof  the  evidence  it  had  previously  disclosed  from  FISA  surveillance  was  itself  the \nfruit of  earlier  information  obtained  without  a  warrant  pursuant  to  Section 702  of \nthe  FISA  Amendments  Act  (“Section  702”),  Pub.  L.  No,  110-261,  122 Stat.  2436 \n(2008),  codified  at 50  U.S.C.  §  1881a. \nIt  is  that  Section  702-derived  evidence  —  primarily  electronic \ncommunications  between  Hasbajrami  and  individuals  without  ties  to  the  United \nStates  and  located  abroad  —  that  is  at issue  in  this  appeal.  Following  the \ndisclosure  of  Section  702  surveillance,  the  district  court  (John  Gleeson,  then-J.) \npermitted  Hasbajrami  to  withdraw his  plea;  Hasbajrami  subsequently  moved  to \nsuppress  all  evidence  seized  by  the  government under  its  Section  702  programs,\n  \nPPA eetekr  te  te  Oo PSMYEF   Psre dts gesw t  obO F  eAy y Soe pAoaRe  eep he \n_  ay  *  s  2  x  wee  to  ‘ \nas  well  as  any  fruits  of  that  surveillance,  including  the  evidence  obtained \npursuant  to  FISA  warrants  and  inculpatory  statements  Hasbajrami  made  upon \narrest.  The  district  court  denied  the  motion  to  suppress,  and  Hasbajrami  again \npleaded  guilty,  reserving  his  right  to  appeal  the  district  court’s  denial  of  his \nsuppression  motion. \nThe  vast  majority  of  Section  702  surveillance  at  issue  here  involves \ninformation  the  government  collected  about  Hasbajrami  incidental  to  its \nsurveillance  of  other  individuals  without  ties  to  the  United  States  and  located \n  \n+  This  opinion  has  been  reviewed  by  appropriate  intelligence  agencies  for  the \npurpose  of  redacting  material  that  includes  or  references  classified  information. \nAfter  an  initial  redaction,  the  panel  met  ex  parte  with  representatives  of  those \nagencies  in  order  to  discuss  potential  substitutions  or  modified  phrasing  that \nwould  minimize  the  need  for  redaction,  and  the  possibility  that  certain \ninformation  referenced  in  the  opinion  could  be  declassified,  thus  further \n5\nIn  light  of  that  disclosure,  and  the  evidence  in  the  public  and  classified \nrecord,  we  reach  three  principal  conclusions: \nFirst,  the  “incidental  collection”  of  communications \n(that  is,  the  collection  of  the  communications  of \nindividuals  in the  United  States  acquired  in  the  course \nof  the  surveillance  of  individuals  without  ties  to  the \nUnited  States  and  located  abroad)  is  permissible  under \nthe  Fourth  Amendment.  We  therefore  conclude,  in \nagreement  with  the  district  court,  that,  at  least  insofar  as \nthe  record  available  to  the  district  court  is  concerned, \nthe  vast  majority  of  the  evidence  detailed  in  the  record \nwas  lawfully  collected. \nSecond,  the  “inadvertent  collection”  of  communications \nof  those  located  within  the  United  States  (that  is,  the \nacquisition  of communications  accidentally  collected \nbecause  an  intelligence  agency  mistakenly  believes  that \nan  individual  is  anon-United  States  person  located \nabroad  and  therefore  targets  that  individual's  e-mail \naddress  under  its  Section 702  authority)  raises  novel \nconstitutional  questions.  We  do  not  reach  those \n  \nreducing  the  need  for  redaction.  That  meeting  was  transcribed  for  the  record, \nand  the  transcript  (which is  itself classified)  will  be  preserved  as  part of  the \nrecord  of  this  appeal  in  the  custody  of  a  Classified  Information  Security Officer \nwith  the  Department  of Justice’s  Litigation  Security  Group.  The  meeting  was \nextremely  productive,  and  has  resulted  in  a  modest  number  of changes  of \nwording  that  do  not  affect  the  substance  of  the  opinion,  and  a  significant \nreduction  in  the  amount of  redacted  material.  It  is  of  course  regrettable  that  any \npart  of  an  opinion  disposing  of  a  criminal  appeal  is  unavailable  for  public \ninspection.  However,  we  have  neither  the  authority,  nor  the  expertise,  nor  the \ninclination  to  overrule  classification  decisions  made  by  the  relevant executive \nbranch  agencies.  We  respect  the  need  for  such  classification  of sensitive  national \nsecurity  information,  and  appreciate  the  cooperation  of  the  agencies  in  the  effort \nto  limit  the  need  for  modifications  and  redactions. \n6\nquestions  today  because  we  are  satisfied  that,  to  the \nextent  such  accidental  collection  occurred  in  this  case, \nany  information  thus  acquired  did  not  taint  the \ninvestigation  or  prosecution  of  Hasbajrami. \nThird,  querying  databases  of  stored  information  derived \nfrom  Section  702-acquired  surveillance  also  raises  novel \nand  difficult  questions.  Querying,  depending  on  the \nparticulars  of  a  given  case  (such  as  what  databases  are \nqueried,  for  what  purpose,  and  under  what \ncircumstances),  could  violate  the  Fourth  Amendment, \nand  thus  require  the  suppression  of  evidence;  therefore, \na  district  court  must  ensure  that  any  such  querying  was \nreasonable.  But  no  information  about  any  queries \nconducted  as  to  Hasbajrami  was  provided  to  the  district \ncourt,  and  the  information  provided  to us  on  this \nsubject  is  too  sparse  to  reach a  conclusion  as  to  the \nreasonableness  of  any  such  queries  conducted  as  to \nHasbajrami. \nGiven  these  conclusions,  further  proceedings  are  necessary  to  determine  (a)  what \n(if  any)  evidence  relevant  to  Hasbajrami  was  obtained  by  the  government  by \nquerying  databases,  (b)  whether  any  such  querying  violated  the  Fourth \nAmendment  and,  if  so,  (c)  whether  any  such  violation  tainted  other  lawfully- \ncollected  evidence.  We  therefore  REMAND  the  case  to  the  district  court  for \nfurther  proceedings  consistent  with  this  opinion. \nBACKGROUND \nThis  appeal  concerns  the  legal  status  of  evidence  of Hasbajrami’s  electronic \ncommunications  with  individuals  located  abroad,  which  was  collected  by  the \n7\ngovernment  without  a  warrant  pursuant  to  the  government's  authority  under \nSection  702.  The  background  to  this  appeal  may  be  easily  summarized: \nHasbajrami  sought  to  suppress  evidence  the  government  acquired  under  Section \n702,  arguing  that  the  government  had  violated  his  Fourth  Amendment  rights \nwhen  it  seized  his  communications  without  a warrant,  and  that  those \ncommunications,  and  any  information  that  the  government  later  collected  as  the \nfruit  of  that  initial  warrantless  surveillance,  should  therefore  be  suppressed.  The \ndistrict  court  declined  to  suppress  the  evidence,  and  Hasbajrami  pleaded  guilty \nwhile  reserving  his  right  to  appeal  the  district  court’s  decision. \nBut  our  disposition  of  the  case  turns  in  part  on  the  particulars  of how \nSection  702-acquired  surveillance  was  used  in  Hasbajrami’s  prosecution; a  fuller \naccounting  of the  facts  of  Hasbajrami’s  case  and  the  nature  of  Section  702 \nsurveillance  is  therefore  necessary.  First,  we begin  by  describing Hasbajrami’s \narrest  and  the  initial  proceedings  in  which  he  pleaded  guilty,  the  subsequent \ndisclosure  of Section  702  surveillance,  Hasbajrami’s  withdrawal  of  his  guilty \nplea,  and  his  subsequent  motion  to  suppress.  Second,  we  describe  in  broad  terms \nthe  operation  of  Section  702  surveillance.  Third,  we  turn  to  the  district  court's \ndiscussion  of  the  use  of  Section  702  evidence  (that  it was  aware  of)  in  this  case,\nand  its  denial  of  the  suppression  motion.  Finally,  we  describe  the  proceedings  at \nthe  district  court  following  its  denial  of  the  suppression  motion,  and  the \nproceedings  on  appeal. \nI,  Allegations  and  Initial  Proceedings \nThe  conduct  underlying  Hasbajrami's  prosecution  occurred  primarily \nbetween  April  and  August,  2011.  During  that  time,  Hasbajrami  communicated \nby  e-mail  with  “Individual  #1,”  a  non-American  located  abroad,  who  Hasbajrami \nbelieved  was  associated  with  a  terrorist  organization,  In  those  e-mails, \nHasbajrami  discussed  his  interest  in  the  group’s  terrorist  operations,  and \nIndividual  #1  instructed  Hasbajrami  how  he  could  smuggle  himself  into  Pakistan \nto join  the  organization.  Individual  #1  also  detailed  means  by  which  Hasbajrami \ncould  send  money  to  him  and  how  Hasbajrami  could  contact  him  ance  he \nreached  Pakistan.  In  discussing  his  plans  to  join  Individual  #1  in  Pakistan, \nHasbajrami  also  described  his  arrangements  for  travelmg  to  Turkey,  and  his \nconcern  that  his  projected  route  from  there  to  Pakistan  might  have  been \ncompromised. \nFollowing  an  investigation  by  the  agents  of  the  Federal  Bureau  of \nInvestigation’s  Joint  Terrorism  Task  Force,  Hasbajrami  was  arrested  as  he  was\nabout  to  board  a  flight  to  Istanbul,  Turkey.  His  luggage  contained  a  tent,  boots, \nand  cold-weather  gear.  Upon  arrest,  Hasbajrami  made  certain inculpatory \nstatements. \nA.  Initial  Proceedings \nHasbajrami  was  indicted  on  September  8,  2011,  and  charged  with  one \ncount  of  providing  material  support to  terrorist  organizations,  At  the  same  time, \nand  as  required  by  statute,  the  government  gave  notice  that  it  “intend[ed]  to \noffer  into  evidence,  or  otherwise  use  or  disclose  in  any  proceedings... \ninformation  obtained  or  derived  from  electronic  surveillance  and  physical \nsearches  conducted  pursuant  to  [FISA].”  See  Notice  of  Intent  to  Use  Foreign \nIntelligence  Surveillance  Act  Information,  United  States  v.  Hasbajrami,  1:11-cr-623 \n(E.D.N.Y.  filed  Sept.  13,  2011),  ECF  No.  9. \nIn  discovery,  Hasbajrami  was  provided  with evidence  of his \ncommunications  obtained  pursuant  to  traditional  FISA  warrants,’  and  he \n  \n2  As  detailed below,  this  opinion  will  use  “traditional  FISA”  to  describe  FISA \nsurveillance  that  was  authorized  by  statute  prior  to  the  enactment of Section  702. \nThe  FISA  Amendments  Act will  be  referred  to  as  the  “FAA,”  of which  Section \n702  is  one  part. \n10\neventually  pleaded  guilty  on  April  12,  2012,  to  one  count  of  providing  material \nsupport  to  terrorists.  He  was  sentenced  to  180  months’  imprisonment. \nB.  Disclosure  of  Section  702  Surveillance,  Withdrawal  of Plea,  and \nMotion  to  Suppress \nAfter  Hasbajrami’s  initial  plea  and  sentencing,  and  while  Hasbajrami  was \nserving  his  sentence,  the  government  disclosed  that  it had  collected  Hasbajrami’s \ncommunications  under  Section  702  of the  FAA.  In a  letter  sent  to  Hasbajrami  in \nFebruary  2014,  the  government  stated  that  “based  on  a  recent  determination,”  it \nhad  concluded  that  the  information  obtained  from  FISA  surveillance  that  the \ngovernment had  already  disclosed  “was  itself  also  derived  from  other  collection \npursuant  to  Title  VII  of FISA  [i.e.,  Section  702]  as  to  which  you  were  aggrieved.” \nApp’x  at  31.  The  government  stated  that  “certain evidence  and  information  ... \nthat  the  government  intended  to  offer  into  evidence  or  otherwise  use  or  disclose \n  \n3  The  government’s  provision  of  notice  in  this  case  was  likely  in  response  the \nSolicitor General’s  assertion,  at  oral  argument before  the  Supreme  Court  in \nClapper  v.  Amnesty International  USA,  568  U.S.  398  (2013),  that  prosecutors  would \nprovide  notice  to  defendants  in  cases  where  evidence  was  derived  from  Section \n702  surveillance.  See  Charlie  Savage,  Door  May  Open  Challenge  to  Secret  Wiretaps, \nN.Y.Times  (Oct.  17,  2013),  at  A3.  While  the  government’s  policy  prior  to  Clapper \nwas  not  to  provide  notice  of  Section  702  surveillance,  it  began  reviewing  cases \nand  providing  supplemental  notice  in  2013.  fd. \n11\nin proceedings  in  this  case  was  derived  from  acquisition  of  foreign  intelligence \ninformation  conducted  pursuant  to  the  FAA.”  Id. \nIn  response  to  that  disclosure,  Hasbajrami  sought  leave  to  withdraw  his \nplea.  The  district  court  granted  that  motion,  finding  that  Hasbajrami  had \n“specifically  asked  [his  counsel]  about whether  warrantless  wiretaps  had  played \na  role  in  his  case.  After  [counsel]  informed  him  that  such  wiretaps  were  not  part \nof  the  evidence,  he  was  more  willing  to  plead  guilty.  Thus,  Hasbajrami  seems  to \nhave  been  misled  about  a  fact  he  considered  important  in  deciding  how  to \nplead.”  App’x  at 39.  Furthermore,  the  government's  misleading  notice,  according \nto  the  district  court,  prevented  Hasbajrami  from  knowing  that  he  could  challenge \nthe  evidence  against him  on  the  grounds  that Section  702  was  unconstitutional. \nThe  court  concluded  that,  prior  to  the  letter  disclosing  Section  702  surveillance, \nHasbajrami  “was  not  sufficiently  informed  about  the  facts”  to  have  “made  an \nintelligent  decision  about  whether  to  plead  guilty[.]  When  the  government \nprovided  FISA  notice  without FAA  notice,  Hasbajrami  was  misled  about  an \nimportant  aspect  of  his  case.”  App’x  at  38.  Accordingly,  the  court  allowed him  to \nwithdraw  the  plea  and  reopened  the  case. \n12\nHasbajrami  then  moved  to  suppress  “the  fruits  of  all  warrantless  FAA \nsurveillance,”  the  motion  that  is  at  issue  in  this  appeal.  See  Omnibus  Motions  at \n8-9,  United  States  v.  Hasbajrami,  1:11-cr-623  (E.D.N.Y.  filed  Nov.  26,  2014),  ECF \nNo.  92  (“Suppression  Motion”),  He  described  what  he  sought  to  suppress,  “the \nfruits of all  warrantless  FAA  surveillance,”  as  including: \ne  all  evidence  and  information  derived  as  a  result  of  Title \nVII  warrantless  FAA  surveillance; \ne  all  evidence  and  information  “obtained  or  derived  from \nTitle  I  and  Title  II  FISA  collection  ...  {that  was]  itself \nalso  derived  from  other  collection  pursuant to  Title  VII\" \nof the  FAA; \n°  Hasbajrami’s  custodial  statements;  and \n°  Any  other  evidence  and  information  that  the \nGovernment  could  not have  obtained  in  this  case \nthrough  an  independent source. \nId. \nTo  properly  understand  the  scope  of Hasbajrami’s  motion,  however,  it is \nnecessary  to  describe  the  statutory  framework  underpinning  Section  702 \nsurveillance  and  the  way  in  which  the  program  operates  in  practice. \n13\nWl.  Section  702  Surveillance‘ \nIn  order  to  ensure  national  security,  the  United  States  maintains  several \nprograms  aimed  at  the  surveillance  of  those  who  pose  threats  to  its  safety.  These \nprograms each  draw  on  a  wide  variety  of  authority,  including  executive  orders, \nstatutory provisions,  and  agency  procedures  and  guidance.  See generally Diana \nLee,  Paulina  Perlin  &  Joe  Schottenfeld,  Gathering Intelligence:  Drifting  Meaning and \n  \n4  The  purpose  of  this  section  is  to  provide  the  general  background  necessary  to \nunderstand  the  parties’  arguments  and  it  is  not  intended  to  provide  a \ncomprehensive  description  of  the  way  in  which  each  agency  implements  Section \n702  surveillance.  Additionally,  as  detailed  below,  each  agency  must seek \napproval  of  its  Section  702  procedures  each  year,  including  changes  in  operation. \nOur intention  is  thus  only  to  describe  the  program  in  broad  terms.  We  note, \nmoreover,  that  many  Section  702  procedures  remain  highly  classified,  including \nthe  specific  procedures  under  which  the  collection  of  Hasbajrami’s \ncommunications  would  likely  have  taken  place.  Our  discussion  here  is  drawn \nfrom  declassified  public  sources  and  in  large  part  from  the  report  on Section  702 \nsurveillance  produced  by  the  Privacy  and  Civil  Liberties  Oversight  Board.  See \nPrivacy  and  Civil  Liberties  Oversight Board,  Report  on  the  Surveillance  Program \nOperated  Pursuant  to  Section  702  of  the  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Act \n(July  2,  2014),  https://www.pclob.gov/library/702-Report.pdf  (“PCLOB Report’). \nThe  PCLOB  is  an  independent  agency  within  the  executive  branch,  authorized \nby  statute,  infer alia,  to  “analyze  and  review  actions  the  executive  branch  takes” \nand  “ensure  that  liberty  concerns  are  appropriately  considered”  in  the \ngovernment’s  development  and  implementation  of anti-terrorism  programs.  See \n42  U.S.C.  §  2000ee(c).  The  PCLOB  is  composed  of  five  members,  appointed  by  the \nPresident  and  confirmed  by  the  Senate.  Id,  §  2000ee(h). \nAccordingly,  we  discuss  the  program,  and  changes  in  its  operation  over \ntime,  only  to  the  extent  that the  details  are  (a)  relevant  and  (b)  public. \n14\nthe  Modern  Surveillance  Apparatus,  10  J.  of  Nat‘l  Sec.  L.  &  Pol'y  77  (2019) \n(describing  several  separate  authorities  for  surveillance,  including  FISA  and \nSection  702,  each  with  separate  operating  standards).  Hasbajrami’s  appeal \nspecifically  implicates  the  government's  statutory  authority  under  FISA,  first \nenacted  in  1978,  and  more  specifically  the  amendments  to  FISA,  including \nSection  702,  enacted  in  2008.° \nFISA  was  first  enacted  in  response  to  revelations  about  the  government's \nelectronic  surveillance  of  the  domestic  communications  of  United  States  citizens. \nSee  David  S.  Kris  & J.  Douglas  Wilson,  National  Security  Investigations  and \nProsecutions  §  3:7  (“Kris  &  Wilson”).  “Traditional  FISA”  surveillance,  as \nsurveillance  under  the  FISA  has  come  to  be  known  following  the  enactment  of \nthe  FAA  in 2008,  governed  surveillance  inside  the  United  States,  in  the  context \nonly  of  national  security  investigations  rather  than  domestic  criminal \nprosecutions.  See  id.  §  4:2.  For  those  national  security  investigations,  FISA \nestablished  procedures  governing  the  collection  of  information  derived  from \n  \n5  While  Section  702  was  first  enacted  in  2008,  the fact  that  any  e-mails  tied  to \nAmericans  were  sometimes  collected  under  its  authority  was  not  made  public \nuntil  June  2013,  when  “two  classified  [National  Security  Agency  (\"NSA”)] \ncollection  programs  were  first  reported  by  the  press  based  on  unauthorized \ndisclosures  of  classified  documents  by  Edward  Snowden,  a  contractor  for  the \nNSA.”  PCLOB  Report  at  1. \n15\nelectronic  surveillance,  physical  searches,  “pen/trap”  surveillance,  and  tangible- \nthings  production  orders,  and  the  use  of  information  so  obtained.  See  id.  §  4:5. \nIn  order  to  initiate  traditional FISA  surveillance,  the  gevernment  must \nsubmit  an  application  to  a  court demonstratmg  that  there  is  “probable  cause  to \nbelieve  that  ‘the  target  of  the  electronic  surveillance  is  a  foreign  power  or  agent \nof  a  foreign  power,’  and  that each  of  the  specific  ‘facilities  or  places  at  which  the \nelectronic  surveillance  is  directed  is  being  used,  or  is  about  to  be  used,  by  a \nforeign  power  or  an  agent  of  a  foreign  power.’”  See  Clapper,  568  U.S.  at  403 \n(quoting FISA  §  105(a)(3)).  FISA  applications  are  reviewed  by  two  specialized \ncourts:  the  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court  (“FISC”)  and  the  Foreign \nIntelligence  Surveillance  Court  of  Review  (“FISCR”),  both  composed  of Article \nIII  federal judges  assigned  to  their  role  by  the  Chief Justice  of  the  United  States. \nsee  id,;  Kris  &  Wilson  §  5:1  (describing  jurisdiction  of FISC  and  FISCR). \nApplications  are  submitted  under  oath by  a  federal  officer  and  must  describe, \namong  other  things,  whom  the  government  wishes  to  search  or  surveil,  the  place \nor  things  to  be  searched  or  surveilled,  the  sort  of  information  the  government \nexpects  to  gather,  and  the  existence  and  nature  of any  prior  FISA  applications \ntargeting  the  individual.  See  generally  Kris  &  Wilson  §  6:2. \n16\nTraditional  FISA  had  some  limitations,  however.  Because  each  application \nrequired  a  court order,  which  in  turn  required  probable  cause,  the  government \nbelieved  “that,  after  September  11,  2001,  [FISA’s]  requirements  unduly  restrict[ed \nthe]  speed  and  agility”  with  which  the  government  could  detect  and  respond  to \nterrorist  threats.  See  id.  §  16:2  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  Additionally, \nthe  advent  of e-mail  “clearly  expanded  traditional  FISA’s  reach.”  Id.  §  16:6. \nCommunications,  such  as  phone  calls,  between  two  individuals  without  ties  to \nthe  United  States  and  located  abroad  were  outside  the  purview  of  FISA,  and  any \ncollection  of  such  communications  that  occurred  would  not  be  constrained  by  its \nprocedures.  /d.  But  as  such  communication  increasingly  came  to  be  conducted  by \ne-mail,  many  of  those  e-mails  would  ultimately  be  stored  on  servers  within  the \nUnited  States,  and  thus  “the  government  could  not  conduct  warrantless \nsurveillance  in  the  U.S.  of  stored  e-mail  messages  exchanged  between  two  parties \nlocated  abroad”  without  following  the  procedures  laid  out  in  FISA.  Id. \nFirst enacted  in  2008,  Section  702  was  intended  to  address  some  of FISA’s \nperceived  limitations.*  Section  702  allows  the  Attomey  General  (“AG”)  and \n  \n6  President  George  W.  Bush  initially  authorized  the  NSA  “to  conduct  warrantless \nwiretapping  of  telephone  and  e-mail  communications  where  one  party  to  the \ncommunication  was  located  outside  the  United  States”  and  one  party  was \nbelieved  to  be  a  member  of  a  terrorist organization.  See  Clapper,  568  US.  at  403. \n17\nDirector  of  National  Intelligence  (“DNI”)  to  “authorize  jointly  .  .  .  the  targeting  of \npersons  reasonably  believed  to  be  located  outside  the  United  States  to  acquire \nforeign  intelligence  information.”  50  U.S.C.  §  1881a(a).”  That  targeting  is \nprimarily  executed  by  compelling  electronic  service  providers,  including  internet \nservice  providers  and  companies  that  maintain  the  communications \ninfrastructure,  to  “immediately provide the Government  with  all  information, \nfacilities,  or  assistance  necessary  to  accomplish  the  acquisition  [of \ncommunications  of  an  individual  or  his  or  her  account]  in  a  manner  that  will \nprotect the  secrecy  of  the  acquisition  and  produce  a  minimum  of  interference \nwith the  services  that  such  electronic  communication service  provider  is \nproviding  to  the  target  of  the  acquisition.”  50 U.S.C.  §  1881a(i)(1}{A). \n  \nFollowing  public  revelations  of  the  program,  Congress  passed  the  Protect \nAmerica  Act  (“PAA”),  Pub.  L.  No.  110-55,  121  Stat.  552  (2007),  which  for  a  limited \nperiod  of time  allowed  the  government to  use  surveillance  procedures  similar  to \nthose  contained  in  the  FAA.  See  In  re  Directives,  551  F.3d  1004,  1006-07  (FISA  Ct. \nRev.  2008).  The  PAA  expired  on February  16,  2008.  See  id.  at  1006  n.1. \n?  Like  other  sections  of  the  FISA,  Section  702’s  definition  of  “United  States \nperson”  includes  lawful  permanent  residents  (such  as  Hasbajrami).  See  50  U.S.C. \n§  1801(i)  (defining  “United  States  person”  to  be  a  “citizen  of  the  United  States,  an \nalien  lawfully  admitted  for  permanent  residence”  or  certain  unincorporated \nassociations  or  corporations  with  ties  to  the  United  States). \n18\n  \nSection  702  differs  from  traditional  FISA  procedures  in  several  key \nrespects.  First,  Section  702  does not  require  a  probable  cause  determination \nbefore undertaking  surveillance.  Clapper,  568  U.S.  at 404,  Second,  Section  702 \n“does not  require  the  Government  to  specify  [in  a  FISA  application]  the  nature \nand  location  of  each  of  the  particular  facilities  or  places  at  which  the  electronic \nsurveillance  will  occur.”  Id.  Instead,  as  detailed  below,  the  FISC  approves  Section \n702  procedures  in  advance,  targeting  non-United States  persons  located  abroad \nas  a  category,  and  the  government  does  not  have  to  return  to  the  FISC  to  seek \napproval  before  it undertakes  surveillance  of  any  specific  individual  or  his  or her \naccounts  under  those  Section  702  procedures.  See  Kris  &  Wilson  §  17:17. \nIn  short,  under  the  FAA  and  Section  702  the  government  may  compel \nservice  providers  located  in  the  United  States  to  provide e-mails  or  other \nelectronic  communications  to,  from,  or  about individuals  the  government \nbelieves  are  (a)  not  United  States  persons  and  (b)  located  abroad.’  Both  under  the \n  \n8  The  FAA  also  contains  two  sections,  Sections  703  and  704,  that  address  the \ndirect  targeting  of  individual  United  States  persons  outside  the  United  States  for \nelectronic  surveillance.  See  Laura  K.  Donohue,  Section  702  and  the  Collection  of \nInternational  Telephone and  Internet  Content,  38  Harv.  J.L.  &  Pub.  Pol’y  117,  142-44 \n(2015).  The  procedures  followed  “generally reflect  the  structure  employed  by \ntraditional  FISA  with  regard  to electronic surveillance  and  physical  search.”  Id.  at \n143.  These  sections  are  codified  at  50  U.S.C.  §§  1881b  and  1881c,  and  are  not  at \nissue  in  this  appeal. \n19\nstatutory  scheme  and  in  practice,  Section  702  surveillance  unfolds  in several \ndifferent  steps,  each  with  different  implications  for  this  Court’s  review.  The  first \nstep  is  what  the  statute  and  intelligence  community  refers  to  as  “targeting,” \nfollowed  by  collection,  “minimization,”  retention  and  storage,  and,  finally, \ndissemination  and  querying.’  We  will  discuss  each  step  in  turn. \nA.  “Targeting” \nTargeting  generally  refers  to  the decision  to  surveil  an  individual  or  his  or \nher  channels  of  electronic  communications,  such  as  an  e-mail  address.  The \ngovernment may  not  “intentionally  target”  for  Section  702  surveillance  anyone \nlocated  in  the  United  States  or  a  “United  States  person”  outside  the  United \nStates.  50  U.S.C.  §§  1881a(b)(1),  (3).  Nor  may  it  target  a  non-United  States  person \n“if  the  purpose  of  such  acquisition  is  to  target  a  particular,  known  person \nreasonably  believed  fo  be  in  the  United  States.”  50  U.S.C.  §  1881a(b)(2). \n  \n9  Some  of  these  terms,  such  as  collection,  are  terms  of  art,  but  their  use  is  not \nnecessarily  uniform  across  the  various  government  agencies  or  for  different \nforms  of  surveillance.  See,  e.g.,  Lee,  Perlm  &  Schottenfeld,  Gathering  Intelligence  at \n95  (highlighting  “definitional  variances”  for  terms  like  collection,  acquisition, \nand  targeting  across  the  various  surveillance  programs).  For  the  purposes  of \nproviding background  to  Hasbajrami’s  case,  we  define  the  terms  primarily  as \neach is  used  by  the  PCLOB. \n20\nThe  precise  mechanisms  each  agency  must  follow  to  target \ncommunications  are  not  specified  by  the  statute.  Instead,  Section  702  requires  the \nAG  and  the  DNI  to  adopt  targeting  procedures  each  year  that  will  govern  how \nthe  program  functions  at each  agency  tasked  with  Section  702  surveillance.  See 50 \nU.S.C.  §§  1881 a(a),  (d).  While  labelled  targeting procedures,  the  procedures  are \njust  as  much  about  who  is  not  to  be  targeted  under  Section  702  (that  is,  how  to \nprevent  acquisition  of  the  communications  of  those  in  the  United  States  or  who \nare  United  States  persons)  as  about  setting out  who  is  to  be  targeted.  In  this \nopinion,  our  concern with  “targeting”  is  with  the  procedures  designed  to  protect \nthe  constitutional  privacy  rights  of  Americans  and  comply  with  the  Fourth \nAmendment  inside  the  United  States,  and  not  with  the  obviously  confidential \nprocedures  and  criteria  by  which  United  States  intelligence  agencies  decide \nwhich  non-United  States  persons  located  abroad  are  appropriate  objects  of \nsurveillance. \nThe  targeting  procedures  are  supposed  to  ensure  that  any  authorized \nacquisition  is  “limited  to  targeting  persons  reasonably  believed  to  be  located \noutside  the  United  States”  and  to  “prevent the  intentional  acquisition  of  any \ncommunication  as  to  which  the  sender  and  all  intended  recipients  are  known  at \n21\nthe  time  of  the  acquisition  to  be  located  in  the  United  States.”  50  U.S.C. \n§  1881a(d)(1).  Targeting  procedures  are  also  subject  to  the  limitations  related  to \ntargeting  United  States  persons  outlined  above.  50  U.S.C.  §  1881a(b).  The  NSA \nand  the  FBI  each  develop  targeting  procedures  tailored  to  the  agency’s  particular \nmission  and  purpose  in  using  Section  702-acquired  information.  PCLOB  Report \nat  41-43,  47. \nOnce  the  required  procedures  have  been  formulated,  the  DNI  and  AG \nmust  seek  approval  of  their  proposed  targeting  procedures  from  the  FISC.  50 \nU.S.C.  §  1881a(d)(2).  The  FISC  reviews  the  proposed  standards  for  compliance \nwith both  statutory  and  constitutional  requirements.  See,  e.g.,  In  re  Proceedings \nRequired  by  702(i)  of FISA  Amendments  Act  of 2008,  No.  MISC  08-01,  2008  WL \n9487946,  at  *5  (FISA  Ct.  Aug  27,  2008);  Redacted,  2011  WL  10945618  at  *1  (FISA  Ct. \nOct.  3,  2011)  (“Bates  Decision’).  In  contrast  to  traditional  domestic  search \nwarrants  and  FISA  warrants,  which  authorize searches  or  seizures  of  specific \npersons,  places,  or  things  based  on  individualized  probable  cause,  judicial \nreview  of  Section  702  functions  as  a  form  of  programmatic  pre-clearance.  “(T]he \nCourt is  required  to  consider  whether  the  targeting  .  ..  procedures  adopted  by \nthe  Government  meet  the  requirements  of  the  statute  and  .  .  .  are  consistent  with\nthe  Fourth  Amendment.  The  Court  is  not  required,  in the  course  of  this  Section \n702(i)  review,  to  reach  beyond  the  Government’s  procedures  and  conduct  a  facial \nreview  of  the  constitutionality  of  the  statute.”  In  re  Proceedings,  2008  WL  9487946, \nat  *5;  see  also  PCLOB  at  26-31  (describing  judicial  review  proceedings  under \nSection  702). \nOnce  its  procedures  are  approved  by  the  FISC,  an  agency  can  begin \nsurveilling  individuals  it  seeks  to  target.  The  NSA  “initiates  all  Section  702 \ntargeting,  and  thus  makes  all  initial  decisions  pursuant  to  its  targeting \nprocedures.”  PCLOB  Report  at 42.  According  to  the  PCLOB,  the  CIA  and  the  FBI \ncan  “‘nominate’  targets  to  the  NSA  for  Section  702  targeting”  but  the  NSA  is \nrequired  to  “make  the  determination  whether  to  initiate  targeting.”  Id. \nSection  702  surveillance  usually  begins  when  an  agency  “tasks”  a  specific \n“selector”  or  “facility,”  usually  an  e-mail  address  or  telephone  number.  See  id.  at \n32.  Much  information  about  the  targeting  standards  used  by  the  NSA  remains \nclassified,  but  generally  “[i]f  they  are  to  fulfill  their  purposes .  .  .  [the  targeting \nprocedures  submitted  to  the  FISC  for  approval]  should  contain  a  description  of \nfactors  that in  isolation  or  combination justify  a  reasonable  belief that  the  target  is \nabroad.”  Kris  &  Wilson  §  17:7.  According  to  one  commentator,  the  NSA  “has \n23\nLae \ncreated  a  presumption  of  non-U.S.  person  status,”  assuming  “that the  individual \nis  anon-U.S.  person”  if  the  agency  does  not  know  its  target  is  a  United  States \nperson.  See  Donohue,  Section  702  at  158. \nB.  Collection \nOnce  an  account or facility  such  as  an  e-mail  address  has  been  targeted,  the \nintelligence  agencies  may  then  begin  to  collect  information  related  to  that \nparticular  address.  Such  information  includes  e-mails  to  and  from  a  given \naccount,  or  information  “about”  a  given  account. \n1,  PRISM  and  Upstream  Collection \nThe  NSA  operates  two  separate  types  of  collection  programs  which  collect \ndifferent  types  of  information.  These  two  programs  have  come  to  be  labelled \nPRISM  collection  and  upstream  collection. \nUnder  PRISM,  the  FBI  (on  behalf  of  the  NSA)  sends  “selectors”  (for \ninstance,  an  e-mail  address)  to  internet service  providers  (“ISPs”),  based  im  the \nUnited  States.  The  ISPs  are  then  required  to  provide  communications  sent  to  or \nfrom  that  selector  to  the  NSA.  See  PCLOB  Report  at  33-34.  PRISM,  therefore, \ncollects  only  the  e-mails  a  given  user  sends  from  his  or  her  account,  and  the  e- \nmails he  or  she  receives  from  others  through  that  account.  Id.  at  34.  Collection \n24\nand  review  of  such  material  happens  roughly  in  real  time,  or  close  to  real  time.  In \nother  words,  the  collected  e-mails  are  not  simply  swept  into  a  database  for  use  at \nsome unspecified  future  time  when  the  database  is  queried,  but  are  monitored \nand  analyzed  at  or  near  the  time  of  their  collection.  In  that  regard,  the \ninterception  and  review  of electronic  communications  under  PRISM  resembles  a \ntraditional  domestic law  enforcement  wiretap. \nUpstream  collection  is  broader.  Instead  of  compelling  information  from  an \nISP,  the  NSA  instead  compels  information  from  “the  providers  that  control  the \ntelecommunications backbone  over which  communications  transit.”  PCLOB \nReport  at  35.  Upstream  fills  a  gap  in  PRISM  surveillance.  Id.  If,  for  instance,  an \nindividual  that  the  NSA  sought  to  target  maintained  his  or  her  e-mail  account \nwith  a  foreign  internet service  provider,  that e-mail  address  would  be  out  of \nreach  of  the  PRISM program.  In  that  situation,  the  NSA  could  use  upstream \ncollection  to  collect  traffic  to  that  account  as  it  traversed  the  backbone.  Id. \nUpstream  collection  is  broader  than  PRISM,  in  that  it  captures  not  only \nconversations  to  and  from  a  given  e-mail  address,  but  also  communications \n“about”  that  address  (i.e.,  a  conversation  between  two  parties  not  themselves \ntargeted  that  happens  to  mention  whatever  the  tasked  term  is).  See  1d.  at  37-38. \n25\nOne  key  difference  between  PRISM  and  upstream  collection  is  that  PRISM \ncollects  individual  communications,  while  upstream  collects  whole  “multi- \ncommunication  transactions,”  or  “MCTs.”  Id.  at  39.  “An  Internet  transaction \nrefers  to  any set  of  data  that  travels  across  the  Internet  together  such  that  it  may \nbe  understood  by  a  device  on  the  Internet.”  Id.  Thus,  a  transaction  might  contain \na  single  discrete  communication  (e.g.,  a  single  e-mail),  or  it  could  contain \n“multiple  discrete  communications,”  and  “{i]f  a  single  discrete  communication \nwithin  an  MCT  is  to,  from,  or  about  a  Section  702-tasked  selector,  and  at  least  one \nend  of the  transaction  is  foreign,  the  NSA  will  acquire  the  entire  MCT”  under \nupstream  collection.  Id.  The  result  is  a  “greater  likelihood”  that  upstream \ncollection  will  “result  in  the  acquisition  of  wholly  domestic  communications  and \nextraneous U.S.  person  information.”  [d.  at  41.  The  NSA  is  the  only  agency  that \nreceives  upstream  collection;  the  CIA  and  FBI  are not  provided  with  information \nobtained  in  this  manner  and  do  not  store  it  in  their  databases.  Id.  at  54. \n2.  _—s Incidental  and  Inadvertent  Callection \nAs  detailed  above,  the  statute  primarily  authorizes  agencies  like  the  NSA \nto  collect  the  e-mails  of  “non-United  States  persons”  located  abroad.  But  even  if \nthe  government  scrupulously  follows  the  procedures  intended  to restrict \n26\ncollection  of  communications  to  and  from  persons  with  ties  to  the  United  States, \nthe  agencies  might  still  end  up  collecting  information  about  United  States \npersons  or  those  located  in  the  United  States,  or  communications  sent  to  or  from \na  United  States  person  or  an individual  located  in  the  United  States. \nCollection may  sweep  up  those  individuals’  e-mails  in  two  ways, \nconventionally  referred  to  as  “incidental  collection”  and  “inadvertent  collection.” \nFirst,  collection  might  be  “incidental.”  PCLOB  Report  at  114.  Incidental  collection \noccurs  when  a  non-targeted  individual  (a  United  States  person  or  someone  in  the \nUnited  States)  communicates  with  a  targeted  non-United  States  person  located \nabroad.  Such  collection  would  occur  under  PRISM,  for  instance,  if  the  NSA  has \ntargeted  the  e-mail  address  of  a  non-United  States  person  in  another  country, \nand  a  United  States  person  e-mails  that  targeted  individual.  An  ISP  would  be \nrequired  to  provide  the  NSA  with  any  such  e-mails  as  part  of  its  compliance  with \na  Section  702  directive  targeting  the  non-United  States  party  to  the \ncommunication. \nSecond,  collection  might  be  “inadvertent.”  Id.  at  116.  Inadvertent  collection \noccurs  when  the  NSA  reasonably  believes  that  it  is  targeting  a  non-United  States \nperson  located  abroad,  or  does  not have enough  information  to  determine \n27\nCoe \nwhether  an  individual  e-mail  address  or  other  communications  facility  is  being \nused  by  a  United  States  person  or  accessed  from  within  the  United  States,  and \ntherefore  presumes  that  the  account  is  controlled  by  a  foreigner  outside  the \nUnited  States.  The  collection  is  characterized  as  “inadvertent”  when  the  agency \nlearns  that  the  person  controlling  the  account  is  a  United  States  person  after it \nhas  already  acquired  some  of the  person’s  communications.  In  essence, \ninadvertent collection  occurs  when  the  NSA  targets  United  States  persons  or \nindividuals  located  within  the  United  States  in  error:  the  agency  thought  it  was \ntargeting  a  foreign  individual  abroad,  but  the  targeted  person  was  in  fact  a \nUnited  States  person  or  an  individual  located  in  the  United  States. \nC.  “Minimization” \nIn  general  terms,  minimization  describes  the  manner  in  which  the \ngovernment  processes  communications  after  they  have  been  collected  and  seeks \nto  provide  safeguards  against  the  misuse  of  Section  702  information.  See  PCLOB \nReport  at  50.  The  2011  Minimization  Procedures,  which  have  been  declassified, \napply  “to  the  acquisition,  retention,  use,  and  dissemination  of  non-publicly \navailable  information  concerning  unconsenting  United  States  persons  that  is \nacquired  by  targeting  non-United  States  persons  reasonably  believed  to  be \n28\nD\nw\nlocated  outside  the  United  States.”  See  Minimization  Procedures  Used  by  the \nNational  Security  Agency  in  Connection  with Acquisitions  of Foreign  Intelligence \nInformation  Pursuant  to  Section  702  of the  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Act  of \n1978,  As  Amended  §  1,  National  Security  Agency  (Oct.  31,  2011), \nhttps://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ \nMinimization%20Procedures%20Used%20By%20NSA  %20In%20Connection%20 \nWith%20FISA %20Section%20702.pdf  (“NSA  2011  Minimization  Procedures”).1° \nAs  with  their  targeting  procedures,  the  NSA,  FBI,  and  CIA  must  seek \nyearly  approval  of  their  minimization  procedures  from  the  FISC.  50  U.S.C. \n§  1881a(e)(2).  Section  702  requires  that  each  agency  also  adopt  procedures  that \nprohibit  the  disclosure  of  information  about  United  States  persons  in  a  manner \nthat  identifies  them,  unless  that  identity  is  necessary  to  understand  the \nintelligence  information.  See  50  U.S.C.  §  1881a(e)(1)  (cross-referencing  50  U.S.C. \n§§  1821(4)  and  1801(h));  see  also  Kris  &  Wilson  §  9:1.  By  statute,  the  procedures \nmust  ensure  “that  nonpublicly  available  information,  which  is  not  foreign \nintelligence  information  .  ..  shall  not  be  disseminated  in  a  manner  that  identifies \n10  These  minimization  procedures  were  submitted  to  the  FISC  for  approval  after \nHasbajrami’s  arrest,  and  therefore  did  not  govern  the  operation  of  Section  702 \nduring  the  time  period  relevant  here. \n29 \nee  aaSSa   aoBosat   PN  ow  eae ta Saale  aS  Sok2e  \nREN  SS  MET  PAP  aha  Le pa  Fefarr  SP.  :  4  443 \n&  >  TR  ok ta at at \nany  United  States  person,  without  such  person’s  consent,  unless  such  person’s \nidentity  is  necessary  to  understand  foreign  intelligence  information  or  assess  its \nimportance.”  50  U.S.C.  §  1801(h)(2). \nMinimization  procedures  seek  to  “balance  the  government’s  need  to \nacquire,  retain,  and  disseminate  foreign  intelligence  information,  against  the \ncountervailing  privacy  interests  of  U.S.  persons.”  Kris  &  Wilson  §  9:1;  PCLOB \nReport at 50  (“Minimization  procedures are  best  understood  as  a  set  of  controls \non  data  to  balance  privacy  and  national  security  interests.”).  The  meaning  of  the \nterm  as  used  in  the  FISA  context  is  subtly  different  from  what  it  means  in  the \nmore  familiar  context  of  court-authorized  domestic  electronic  surveillance  by  law \nenforcement  agencies  under  traditional  domestic  wiretaps.  In  the  latter  context, \nminimization  procedures  generally  involve  stopping  the  monitoring  of \ncommunications  that  can  be  determined  in  rea!  time  to  be  non-evidentiary.  In  the \ncontext  of Section  702  surveillance,  the information subject  to  minimization has \nalready  been  collected.  After  review,  it  is  either  retained  or  destroyed; \ninformation  is  “minimized”  by  non-retention.  NSA  analysts  are  instructed  to \n“exercise  reasonable  judgment  in  determining  whether  information  acquired \nmust be  minimized  and  will  destroy  inadvertently  acquired  communications  of \n30\nBFPO  Dean  OF  Af  OS  Darnaift  a:  TQan \nFP  ME  2  Ge  Raf hE  ESS  OE  troy ht  Be AD yes  winds  Paes § \nor  concerning  a  United  States  person  at  the  earliest  practicable  point  in  the \nprocessing  cycle  at  which  such  communication  can  be  identified  either:  as  clearly \nnot  relevant  to  the  authorized  purpose  of  the  acquisition  (e.g.,  the \ncommunication  does  not  contain  foreign  intelligence  information);  or,  as  not \ncontaining  evidence  of  a  crime  which  may  be  disseminated  under  these \nprocedures,”!!  NSA  2011  Minimization  Procedure  §  3(b)(1). \nAfter  an  NSA  analyst  reviews  an  individual  e-mail  communication,  he  or \nshe will  decide  if  the  information  warrants  retention  in  the  NSA's  databases \nand/or  dissemination  to  other  agencies.  The  analyst will  determine  if  “it  is  a \ndomestic  or  foreign  communication  to,  from,  or  about  a  target  and  is  reasonably \nbelieved  to  contain  foreign  intelligence  information  or  evidence  of  a  crime.”  Id. \n§  3(b)(4).  Communications  fitting  this  description  will  thus be  retained  and \nprocessed;  information  not  involving  foreign  intelligence  information  or \nevidence  of  a  crime  will  be  destroyed  unless  it  meets  one  of  several  exceptions, \n  \n11  Tt  is  not  clear  whether  the minimization  procedures’  use  of  “inadvertent”  here \nis  intended  broadly  to  invoke  the  word’s  plain  meaning,  or  is  used  as  a  term  of \nart  to  apply  the  provision  only  to  communications  acquired  as  a  result  of \n“inadvertent  collection,”  as  defined  above,  where  a  United  States  person  has \nbeen  erroneously  targeted. \n31\nsuch  as  when  “the  communication  contains  information  pertaining  to  a  threat  of \nserious harm  to  life  or  property.”  Id.  §  5(4). \nWhen  an  e-mail  or  other  communication  is  processed  and  retained,  the \ninformation  will  be  scanned  and  stored.  Information  that  “do[es]  not  meet  the \nretention  standards  ...  and...  [is]  known  to  contain  communications  of or \nconcerning  United  States  persons”  will  be  “destroyed  upon  recognition.”  Id. \n§  3(c)(1).  If  a  target  moves  to  the  United  States,  or  if  the  NSA  uncovers \ninformation  that  the  target  is  a  United  States  person,  “acquisition  from  that \nperson  will  be  terminated  without  delay.”  Id,  §  3(d)(1). \n“{D]omestic  communications”  —  al!  communications  that  do  not  have  “at \nleast one  communicant  outside  the  United  States,”  id.  §  2(e),  “will  be  promptly \ndestroyed,”  except  under  certain  conditions.  Id.  §  5.  Such  conditions  include  if  a \ncommunication  is  “reasonably  believed  to  contain  significant  foreign  intelligence \ninformation,”  which  may  be  provided  to  the  FBI  (which  in  tum  may  disseminate \ninformation  “in  accordance  with  its  minimization  procedures”).  Id.  §  5(1). \nInformation  that  is  “reasonably  believed  to  contain  evidence  of a  crime  that  has \nbeen,  is  being,  or  is  about  to  be  committed”  may  be  “disseminated  (including \n32\nUnited  States  person  identities)  to  appropriate  Federal  law  enforcement \nagencies.”  Id.  §  5(2). \nD.  Retention  and  Dissemination \nAs  addressed  above,  the  minimization procedures  also  govern  the  ultimate \nretention of surveillance materials and  the  “reporting  of acquired  information \noutside  of  [the]  intelligence  agency”  that  collects  the  information.  PCLOB  Report \nat  64.  The  minimization  procedures  treat  retention  and  dissemination  in  similar \nways:  the  NSA,  for  instance,  may  retain  communications  “in  generally  the  same \nsituations  where  the  NSA  is  permitted  to  disseminate  .  ..  these  communications” \nto  other  agencies.  Id,  at  62, \nThe  retention  and  dissemination  of  information  gathered  under the  FAA  is \nalso  governed  by  the  same  restrictions  that  apply  to  traditional  FISA.  Id.  at  64. \nAdditional  protections  generally  apply  if  the  NSA,  for  instance,  seeks  to \ndisseminate  Section  702  information  containing  the  identity  of  a  United  States \nperson.  The  NSA will  then  “mask”  the  identity,  deleting  any  identifying \ninformation  unless  certain  exceptions  apply.  These  exceptions  include  when  “the \nU.S.  person's  identity  is  necessary  to  understand  foreign  intelligence\ninformation,  or  the  communication  contains  evidence  of  a  crime  and  is being \ndisseminated  to  law  enforcement  authorities.”  Id.  at  65. \nAgencies relying on  NSA  reporting  may  request  that  the  identity  of  a \nUnited  States  person  be  unmasked.  Id.  The  NSA  may  provide  that  information  if \nat  least  one  additional  criterion  is  met,  including  when  “the  identity  of  the \nUnited  States  person  is  necessary  to  understand  foreign  intelligence  information” \nor the  information  “indicates  that  the  United  States  person”  is  an  “agent  of  a \nforeign  power”  or  the  “target  of  intelligence  activities  of  a  foreign  power.”  NSA \n2011  Minimization  Procedure  §  6(b).  Agencies  may  also  request  that  information \nabout  a  given  e-mail  address  or facility  be  forwarded  on  a  regular  basis. \nE.  Storage  and  Querying \nOnce  communications  are  collected  and  retained  or  disseminated,  each \nagency  may  establish  databases  to  store  those  communications  in its  possession, \nand  may  query  those  stored  communications  to  identify  information  of  interest \nin  connection  with  a  particular  investigation  or  agency  function. \nThe  NSA,  CIA,  and  FBI  each  maintain  separate  databases  containing \nSection  702  information  on  which  the  agencies  rely  for  their  own  purposes. \nPCLOB  Report  at  55-56.  According  to  the  PCLOB,  the  NSA,  for  instance,  “often\nstores  data  acquired  from  multiple  lega)  authorities  in  a  single  data  repository.” \nPCLOB  at  55.  The  agency  then  “tags”  the  sources  for  each  piece  of information, \nand  “has  systems  that  prevent  an  analyst from  accessing  or  querying  data \nacquired  under  a  legal  authority  for  which  the  analyst  does  not  have  the  requisite \ntraining.”  Id,  at  55-56.  The  CIA  fimits  access  to databases  that  contain  Section \n702-acquired  information  to  only  those  agents  who  have  had  the  requisite \ntraining.  Id.  at  55.  And  the  FBI  “stores  electronic  data  obtained  from  traditional \nFISA electronic  surveillance  and  physical  searches  ..  .  in  the  same  repositories  as \nthe  FBI  stores  Section  702-acquired  data.”  Id.  at59.  An  agent  without  requisite \ntraining  would  see  whether  a  piece  of  Section  702-acquired  information  was \nresponsive  to  her  query,  but  she  would  not  be  able  to  view  the  actual  underlying \nmaterial  without  clearance.  /d. \n“Data  is  frequently  reviewed  through  queries,  which  identify \ncommunications  that  have  particular  characteristics  specified  in  the  query,  such \nas  containing  a  particular name  or  having been  sent  to  or  from  a  particular  e-mail \naddress.”  Id,  at  127.  Colloquially,  the  parties  (and  those  engaged  in  policy \n  \n12  Each  agency  with  access  to  Section  702  data  provides  training  to  personnel \nregarding  the  proper  use  of  Section  702  material,  as  well  as  the  agency’s \nminimization procedures.  See  PCLOB  Report  at  53-54.  The  exact  training \nprocedures  and  who  is  trained  may  vary  by  agency. \n35\ndebatcs  about  the  program)  have  referred  to  this  querying  capability  as \n“backdoor  searches.” \nOriginally,  the  minimization  procedures  precluded  analysts  from \nsearching  terms  associated  with  United  States  persons.  See  Classified \nSupplemental  App’x  at  121-22  Gq \nee \nee \nee \nee \nes \nApril  2011,  the  government  sought  approvai  for new  minimization  procedures \nthat  allowed  the  querying  of  terms  related  to  United  States  persons.  See  Bates \nDecision,  2011  WL  10945618  at  “7-8.  The  FISC  ultimately  approved  the  new \nprocedures  in  October  2011  (i.e.,  after  Hasbajrami’s  arrest)  because  they  were \n“designed  to  yield  foreign  intelligence  infermation.”  Id.  at  \"7.  Querying,  the court \nstated,  “should  not  be  problematic  in a  collection  that  is  focused  on  non-United \nStates  persons  located  outside  the  United  States  and  that,  in  the  aggregate,  is  less \n36 \n \nlikely  to  result  in  the  acquisition  of  nonpublic  information  regarding  non- \nconsenting  United  States  persons.”  Id. \nIn  a  June  2014  letter  to  Senator  Wyden,  Deirdre  Walsh,  Director  of \nLegislative  Affairs  for  the  Office  of  the  Director  of National  Intelligence,  stated \nthat  each  of  the  three  agencies  allowed  querying.  The  NSA  could  query  Section \n702-acquired  information  if  it  had  a  “reasonable  basis  to  expect  the  query  will \nreturn  foreign  intelligence,”  as  could  the  CIA  and  the  FBI.  See  Response  to \nQuestion  from  the  5  June  2014  Hearing,  Letter  from  Deirdre  Walsh,  Director  of \nLegislative  Affairs,  to  Senator  Ron  Wyden  (June  27,  2014)  (“Walsh  Letter”);  see \nalso  PCLOB  Report  at  57-58.  The  FBI  is  also  allowed  to  query its  own  databases \nin  such  a  way  that  these  queries  are  “designed  to  find  and  extract  evidence  of  a \ncrime.”  Walsh  Letter  at  2.  The  FBI  also  will  query  previously  acquired \ninformation  from  a  variety of  sources,  including  Section  702  when  it  “opens  new \nnational  security investigations.”  Id.  at  3. \nRecently,  and  after  the  time  period  at issue  in this  case,  Congress  enacted \nthe  FISA  Amendments  Reauthorization  Act  of 2017,  Pub.  L.  No.  115-118,  132  Stat. \n3  (2018),  codified  at  50  U.S.C.  §  1881a.  The  act  amended  the  FAA  to  require  the \nagencies  to  develop  “querying  procedures”  alongside  their  targeting  and \n37\nminimization  procedures  and  seek  approval  of  all  three  sets  of  procedures  yearly \nfrom  the  FISC.  Congress  also  amended  the  FAA  to  require  a  court  order  in  most \ncases  where  the  FBI  seeks  to  “access  the  contents  of  communications  ...  that \nwere  retrieved  pursuant  to  a  query  made  using  a  United  States  person  query \nterm  that  was  not  designed  to  find  and  extract  foreign  intelligence  information.” \n50  U.S.C.  §  1881a(f)(2)(A).  Such  querying  standards  were  not  in  place  when  the \nsurveillance  at  issue  here  occurred. \ni.  The  District  Court’s  Denial  of  Hasbajrami’s  Suppression  Motion \nAs  noted  above,  Hasbajrami  moved  to  suppress  “the  fruits  of  all \nwarrantless  FAA  surveillance.”  See  Suppression  Motion  at  8.  He  also  moved  for \ndiscovery  of  the  FISA  and  Section  702  information  relevant  to  his  case. \nAfter  the  district  court  reviewed  the  relevant materials  ex  parte  and  in \ncamera,  it denied  the  suppression  motion.  See  Linited  States  v.  Hasbajrami,  1:11-cr- \n623,  2016  WL  1029500  (E.D.N.Y.  Feb.  18,  2016)  (“Suppression  Decision’).\"  It \ntreated  the  suppression  motion  as  an  as-applied  challenge  to  the  Section  702 \nsurveillance  used  to  support  the  government's  initial  application to  the  FISC, \n  \n13  As  addressed  below,  the  district  court  announced  its  decision  on  February  15, \n2015,  in  a  text  order  on  the  docket,  issued  without  an  opinion.  The  redacted \nopinion was  issued  on  the  public  docket  in March  2016. \n38\nprimarily  addressing  the  issue  of  collection. Jd.  at  *7.  First,  after  noting  the \ndistinction  between  PRISM  and  upstream  collection,  the  court  concluded  that \n“Injone  of  the  Section  702  communications  used  in  Title  I  and  Title  IE  FISA \napplications  targeting  the  agent  of  the  foreign  power  were  ‘about’ \ncommunications”  and  therefore  “the  constitutionality  of  upstream  collection \n[was]  not  at  issue”  in  Hasbajrami’s  case.  Id.  at  *6-7. \nThe  district  court  then  turned  to  PRISM  collection.  Summarizing \nprecedent,  the  court  noted  that  the  Fourth  Amendment  “does  not constrain  the \ngovernment  from  collecting  the  communications  of  non-U.S.  individuals  targeted \nby  Section  702  surveillance.”  Id.  at  *7.  Although  Hasbajrami  was a  legal \npermanent  resident  located  in  the  United  States,  the  court  found  that  it  was \n“non-U.S.  persons  who  were  the  targets  of  Section  702  surveillance”  and  that \nHasbajrami’s  e-mails  were  collected  incidentally  to  the  surveillance  of \nindividuals  the  court  described  as  “legitimate  targets  of  Section  702 \nsurveillance.”  Id.  The  court  concluded  that  the  incidental  interception  of  the \ncommunications  of  individuals  in  the  United  States  was  constitutional  because \nthe  surveillance  was  “lawful  in  the  first  place  —  whether  it  is  the  domestic \nsurveillance  of  U.S.  persons  pursuant  to  a  warrant  or  the  warrantless  surveillance \n39\nof non-U.S.  persons  who  are  abroad  —  [and  therefore]  the  incidental  interception \nof  non-targeted  U.S.  persons’  communications  with  the  targeted  persons  is  also \nlawful.”  Id.  at  *9. \nThe  court  did  not  address  whether  any  inadvertent  collection  related  to \nHasbajrami.  It  also  did  not  address  the  specifics  of  any  querying  as  applied  to \nHasbajrami  in  particular,  and  there  does  not  appear  to  have  been  any  fact- \nfinding  regarding  the  querying  of previously-collected  communications  with \nidentifiers  related  to  Hasbajrami.  Instead,  the  parties  had  raised  querying  within \nthe  context  of  whether  the  minimization procedures  were  reasonable,  and  the \ngovernment argued that it  was  permitted  to  query  whatever  data  it had  lawfully \ncollected  even  if it  used  identifiers  it  knew  were  associated  with  United  States \npersons.  See  Gov’t  Mem.  of  Law  at  71,  United  States  v.  Hasbajramt,  1:11-cr-623 \n(E.D.N-Y.  filed  Dec.  23,  2014),  ECF  No.  97.  To  the  extent  that  the  district  court \nconsidered  querying,  then,  it  appeared  to  adopt  the  government's  position, \nstating  in  a  footnote: \nThat  the  government  is  able  to  query  information \nobtained  under  the  PRISM  program,  i.e.  lawfully- \nobtained  communications  that were  to  or  from \nlegitimate  targets,  does  not  render  the  minimization \nprocedures  inadequate,  as  amici  contend  ....  Here,  once \nthe  government  learned  that  the  target  was  potentially \n40\nan  agent  of  a  foreign  power,  the  government  sought \norders  from  the  FISC  for  electronic  surveillance  and \nphysical  searches  pursuant  to  Title  I  and  Title  III  of \nFISA  targeting  an  agent  of a  foreign  power.  ..  .  [agree \nwith  the  government  that  “[iJt  would  be  perverse  to \nauthorize  the  unrestricted  review  of  lawfully  collected \ninformation  but  then  []  restrict  the  targeted  review  of \nthe  same  infonnation in  response  to  tailored  inquiries.” \nGov't  Br.  at  71-772. \nSuppression  Decision,  2016  WL  1029500  at  *12  n.20. \nAs  for  Hasbajrami’s  request  to  provide  discovery  to  properly-cleared \ndefense  counsel,  the  district  court  concluded  that  disclosure  was  unnecessary.  Id. \nat  *14.  Instead,  its  review  was  “relatively  straightforward  and  not  complex”  and \nthe  district  court  was  “able  to  evaluate  the  legality  of  the  challenged  surveillance \nwithout  concluding  that  due  process  first  warranted  disclosure.”  Id.  at  *14  (citing \nUnited  States  v.  Abu-Jihaad,  630  F.3d  102,  129  (2d  Cir.  2010)). \nIV.  Further Proceedings  at  the  District  Court \nThe  district  court  denied  the  motion  to  suppress  in  a  text  order  dated \nFebruary  20,  2015.  The  order  stated  that  “[a]n  opinion  [would]  follow,”  but  that \nthe  motion  would  be  denied  as  to  “the  fruits  of  the  FAA  surveillance,  including \nthe  defendant’s  post-arrest  statements.”  App’x  at  16.  The  court  noted  that  it \nwould  hold  a  conference  and  “inquire  of  the  government  whether  it  intends  to \noffer  once  again  the  charge  bargain  that  was  previously  accepted  by  the \n41\ndefendant,  and  whether  it  has  considered  the  prospect  of  allowing  the  defendant \nto  enter  such  a  plea  pursuant  to  Rule  11(a)(2),  reserving  his  right  to  seek \nappellate  review  of  {the  district  court’s]  denial  of the  motion  to  suppress \nevidence.”  Id. \nThe  parties  prepared  for  trial,  but  Hasbajrami  in  due  course  again  pleaded \nguilty,  this  time  to  a  two-count  Superseding  Information,  which  charged  him \nwith  providing  and  attempting  to  provide  material  support  to  terrorists. \nAccording  to  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  Hasbajrami: \n[A]gree[d]  not  to  file  an  appeal  or  otherwise  challenge \n...  the  conviction  or  sentence  in  the  event  that  the  Court \nimposes  a  term  of  imprisonment  of  180  months  or \nbelow,  with  the  sole  and  limited  exception  that, \npursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of  Criminal  Procedure \n11(a)(2),  the  defendant  may  appeal  the  District  Court's \nFebruary  20,  2015  denial  of  his  motion  to  suppress \nevidence  that  was  obtained  or  derived  from \nsurveillance  conducted  pursuant  to  the  FISA \nAmendments  Act  of  2008,  50  U.S.C.  §§  1881a  et  seq. \nApp’x  at  48.  Hasbajrami  also  consented  to  his  removal,  after  serving  his  sentence, \nfrom  the  United  States.  The  district  court  sentenced  Hasbajrami  to  a  term  of  180 \nmonths’  imprisonment  on  Count  One  and  12  months’  imprisonment  on  Count \nTwo,  each  to  run  consecutively. \n42\nOn  March  8,  2016  —  more  than  one  year  after  it  denied  the  motion  —  the \ndistrict  court  issued  a  redacted  opinion  on  the  public  docket  explaining  its \nreasons  for  denying  suppression.  Hasbajrami  requested  that  the  full  decision be \nreleased  to  his  cleared  defense  counsel,  so  that he  might  better  prepare  his \nappeal.  The  court  (Dora  L.  Irizarry,  C.J.)/*  held  that  FISA  required  redaction  and \nthat  “Defendant's  counsel  are  not  entitled  to  view  the  Unredacted  Opinion \nbecause  releasing  it  would  reveal  classified  foreign  intelligence  information  and \ncircumvent  FISA  ....”  United  States  v.  Hasbajrami,  1:11-cr-623,  2017  WL  3610595 \nat  “3  (E.D.N.Y.  April  6,  2017). \nV.  Proceedings  on  Appeal \nHasbajrami  timely  filed  two  notices  of  appeal.  The  first  addressed  the \ndistrict  court’s  denial  of  Hasbajrami’s  motion  to  suppress;  the  second  addressed \nthe  district  court’s  decision  to  deny  Hasbajrami’s  counsel  access  to  the \nunredacted  and  unmodified  version  of  the  suppression  ruling.  Both  appeals  were \nconsolidated  and  argument  was  heard  by  this  Court  on  August  27,  2018. \nAt  oral  argument,  the  government  was  unable  to  represent  whether  or  not \nidentifiers  related  to  Hasbajrami  had  been  used  in  querying  previously-acquired \n  \n14  By  this  point,  the  case  had  been  transferred  to  Chief Judge  Irizarry  following \nJudge  Gleeson’s  resignation. \n43\nre tap\nSection  702  surveillance  databases.  This  Court  therefore  ordered  the  government \nto  “identify{]  the record  evidence  that  supports  the  proposed  factual  inference \nthat it  conducted  no  queries  or  backdoor  searches  of  Section  702  material  with \nregard  to  Hasbajrami  before  or  leading  to  the  FISA  court’s  issuance  of  Title  |  and \nTitle  111  warrants  with  respect to  Hasbajrami.”  Order,  United  States  v.  Hasbajrami, \nNos.  15-2684,  17-2669  (2d  Cir.  Sept.  4,  2018),  ECF  No.  203. \nBoth  parties  filed  supplemental  briefing,  including  an  additional  classified \nbrief  from  the  government  (which  was  posted,  heavily  redacted,  on the  public \ndocket  for  this  appeal). \nDISCUSSION \nHasbajrami primarily  raises  an as-applied  challenge  to  the \nconstitutionality  of warrantless  collection  and  review  of  his  communications \nunder Section  702.15  As  the  PCLOB  notes,  judicial  review  of  Section  702 \nsurveillance  presents  particular  challenges  because  the  program: \nentails  many  separate  decisions  to  monitor  large \nnumbers  of  individuals,  resulting  in  the  annual \ncollection  of  hundreds  of millions  of  communications  of \n  \n18  Hasbajrami  also  raises  an  alternative  statutory  argument,  arguing  that \nsuppression was  warranted  because  he  claims  the surveillance  did  not  comply \nwith  the  requirements  of Section  702  itself.  The  Court  has  carefully  considered \nthe  argument,  in  light  of  the  classified  record,  and  finds  it without  merit. \n44 \ndifferent  types,  obtained  through  a  variety  of  methods, \npursuant  to  multiple  foreign  intelligence  imperatives, \nand  involving  four  intelligence  agencies  that  each  have \ntheir  own  rules  governing how  they  may  handle  and \nuse  the  communications  that  are  acquired. \nPCLOB  Report  at  86.  In  other  words,  review  is  difficult because  we  must \nconsider  those  individual  “separate  decisions”  within  the  context  of  the  program \nas  a  whole.!6 \nIn  this  case,  it  is  undisputed  that  the  government  possessed  ample \nevidence  obtained  from  surveillance  authorized  by  a  FISA  warrant  to  convict \nHasbajrami.  The  evidence  that  formed  the  basis  for  that  warrant,  however,  was \nobtained  as  a  result  of  warrantless  Section  702  surveillance  of  non-United  States \npersons  located  abroad.  Thus,  the  primary  issue,  affecting  the  bulk  of  the \nevidence  against  Hasbajrami,  is  whether  the  incidental  collection of  the \ncommunications  of  United States  persons,  without  a  warrant,  violates  the  Fourth \nAmendment.  We  conclude,  as  did  the  district  court,  that  such  collection  is  lawful. \nBut  that  is  not  the  only  action  involving  Section  702  surveillance  at  issue  here. \n  \n16  When  reviewing  a  district  court’s  denial  of  a  motion  to  suppress  evidence,  we \nreview  the  court's  legal  determinations  de  novo  and  its  factual  findings  for  clear \nerror.  United  States  v.  Boles,  914  F.3d  95,  102  (2d  Cir.  2019).  The  issues  on  appeal \nare  legal,  and  therefore  our  review  here  is  de  novo. \n45\n  \nWe  must  also  address  inadvertent  collection,  storage  and  querying,  as  each  of \nthese  issues  is  raised  by  the  record. \nThe  record  is  sufficient  to  permit  us  to  answer  the  principal  question \nbefore  us:  we  conclude  that  the  district court  correctly  held  that  the  incidental \ncollection  in  this  case,  and  the  government's  use  of  the  information  thus \ncollected,  was  lawful.  The  record  also  permits  us  to  conclude  that,  even  assuming \nthat  inadvertent  collection  of  the  communications  of  United  States  persons  may \nin  some  circumstances  violate  the  Constitution,  the  effect  of  any  such  collection \nin  this  case  was  harmless  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  The  absence  of  evidence  in \nthe  record  regarding iii \nSN  20  2v er,  prevents  us  from \ndetermining  the  reasonableness  of  any  such  querying \nprior  to  the  FISC’s  probable-cause  finding,  and  from  fully  understanding how  if \nat  all  the  results  of such  querying  affected  the  subsequent  conduct  of  the \ninvestigation.  As  a  result,  we  inust  remand  for  further  proceedings  and  fact- \nfinding by  the  district  court. \n46\nI,  “Incidental”  Collection \nThe  primary  type  of  Section  702  collection  we  must  address  here  involves \n“incidental”  collection.  The  government  was  “targeting,”  within  the  meaning of \nSection  702,  the  accounts  of  individuals  located  abroad  who  were  reasonably \nbelieved  to  be  agents  of  terrorist  organizations.  In  collecting  communications \nfrom  those  accounts,  the  government collected  e-mails  between  Hasbajrami  and \nNT  |  veins \nHasbajrami’s  suppression  motion,  the  district  court  focused  on  this  incidental \ncollection,  ultimately  concluding  that  a  warrant  was  not  required  and  the \ngovernment’s  actions  were  reasonable. \nOn  appeal,  Hasbajrami  and  the  amici  argue  that  the  Fourth  Amendment \nbars  the  incidental  collection  of  e-mails  of  individuals,  like  Hasbajrami,  located  in \n47\nthe  United  States.  First,  they  argue  that  surveillance  of  individuals  in  the  United \nStates  is  per  se  unreasonable  if  it  is  conducted  without  a  warrant.  They  also  focus \non  the  specific  attributes  of  warrants  —  the  particularity  requirement,  the  need \nfor  a  neutral judicial  forum  and  a  finding  of probable  cause  —  and  argue  that \nSection  702,  the  targeting  and  minimization  procedures,  and  FISC  oversight  do \nnot  provide  a  substitute  procedure  sufficient  to  satisfy  the Fourth  Amendment. \nAccording  to  Hasbajrami,  the  broad  scope  of Section  702’s  surveillance  and  the \ngovernment's  failure  to  seek  a  warrant  or  its  equivalent  render  the  program \nunconstitutional  as  applied  to  him  and  therefore  requires  the  suppression  of \nevidence  acquired  under  the  program. \nWe  disagree.  In  addressing  the  issues  before  us,  we  adopt  an  approach \nsimilar  to  that  employed  by  the  United  States  Court of  Appeals  for  the  Ninth \nCircuit  in  United  States  vu.  Mohamud,  843  F.3d  420  (9th  Cir.  2016).  We must  first \ndecide  whether  a  warrant is  required  for  the  government's  incidental  collection \nof  the  communications  of  United  States  persons.  We  conclude  that  a  warrant  is \nnot  required  for  such  collection.  But  “[e]ven  if  a  warrant  is  not  required,  a  search \nis  not beyond  Fourth  Amendment  scrutiny;  for  it  must  be  reasonable  in  its  scope \nand  manner  of  execution.”  Maryland  v.  King,  569  U.S.  435,  448  (2013);  see  also \n48\nMohamud,  843  F.3d  at  441.  We  further  conclude  that the  incidental  collection  of \nHasbajrami’s  e-mails  was  reasonable. \nA.  No  Warrant  was  Required \nWe  conclude  that  a  warrant  is  not  required  based  on  two  well-established \nprinciples  of  Fourth  Amendment  law.  First,  the  Fourth  Amendment  does  not \napply  extraterritorially  to  the  surveillance  of  persons  abroad,  including  United \nStates  citizens.  Second,  law  enforcement  officers  do  not  need  to  seek  an  additional \nwarrant or  probable  cause  determination  to  continue  surveillance  when,  in  the \ncourse  of  executing  a  warrant  or  engaging  in  other  lawful  search  activities,  they \ncome  upon  evidence  of  other  criminal  activity  outside  the  scope  of  the  warrant  or \nthe  rationale  justifying  the  search,  or  the  participation  of  individuals  not  the \nsubject  of  that  initial  warrant or  search. \nFirst,  the  Fourth  Amendment  (and,  in particular,  its  warrant requirement) \ndoes  not  apply  extraterritorially.  See  United  States  v.  Verdugo-Urquidez,  494  U.S. \n259  (1990).  In  Verdugo-Urquidez,  agents  from  the  United  States  Drug  Enforcement \nAgency,  working  alongside  Mexican  law  enforcement,  raided  without  a  warrant \nproperties  in  Mexico  owned  by  the  defendant.  Id.  at  262-63.  The  agents  believed \nthat  the  defendant  was  the  leader  of  a  narcotics  smuggling  ring  and  they  seized \n49\ndocuments  and  “a  tally  sheet”  detailing  quantities  of  drugs  possessed  and \ntransported.  Jd.  Prior  to  trial,  the  defendant  sought  suppression  of the  evidence, \narguing  that  the  agents  should  have  sought  a  warrant  before  searching  his \nproperty.  Id.  at  263-64. \nThe  Supreme  Court  held  that  suppression  of  the  evidence  was  not \nrequired,  because  the  Fourth  Amendment  does  not  apply  to  extraterritorial \nactions  by  law  enforcement,  at  least  where  the  “[the  defendant]  was  a  citizen  and \nresident  of  Mexico  with  no  voluntary  attachment  to  the  United  States,  and  the \nplace  searched  was  located  in  Mexico.”  Id.  at  274-75.  “Under  these \ncircumstances,”  the  Court  held,  “the  Fourth  Amendment ha[d]  no  application.” \nId.  at  275. \nThis  Court  has  since  extended  Verdugo-Urquidez's  holding  to  conclude  that \nthe  Warrant  Clause  of  the  Fourth  Amendment  does  not  apply  to  the  surveillance \nof  United  States  citizens  abroad.  See  In  re  Terrorist  Bombings,  552  F.3d  157,  171  (2d \nCir.  2008).  The  defendant  in  that  case,  a  United  States  citizen  with  a  home  in \nKenya,  had  “urged  the  suppression  of  the  evidence  resulting  from  the... \n[electronic]  surveillance  of  his  Kenyan  telephone  lines”  because  it  was  not \nauthorized  by  a  valid  warrant  or,  alternatively,  because  the  surveillance  was \n50\nunreasonable.  /d.  at  160.  This  Court held  that  “the  Fourth  Amendment's  Warrant \nClause  has  no  extraterritorial  application  and  that  foreign  searches  of  U.S. \ncitizens  conducted  by  U.S.  agents  are  subject  only  to  the  Fourth  Amendment's \nrequirement  of  reasonableness.”  /d.  at  171.  We  determined  that  the  searches  in \nthat case  were  ultimately  reasonable  and  therefore  suppression  of  the  evidence \nwas  not  required. \nVerdugo-Urguidez  and  In  re  Terrorist  Bombings  make  it  clear  that  the  Fourth \nAmendment  does  not  require  the  government  to  obtain  a  warrant  before \ncollecting  the  e-mails  of  foreign  individuals  abroad.  Nor  can  there  be  any \nquestion  that  the  electronic  surveillance  of  foreign  individuals  located  abroad \nwho  are  reasonably  believed  to  hold  themselves  out  as  agents  and  MB  of \nterrorist  organizations  targeting  the  United  States  is  reasonable  within  the \nmeaning of the  Fourth  Amendinent.  Efforts  to  monitor  the  activities  of  such \nindividuals  to  detect  and  forestall  possible  terrorist attacks  on  this  country \npresent  a  paradigm  case  of  a  compelling  government  interest.  The  protections \nextended  by  the  Fourth  Amendment  to  foreign  individuals  abroad,  if  any,  are \nminima!  and  plainly  outweighed  by  the  paramount  national  interest  in \npreventing  foreign  attacks  on  our  nation  and  its  people. \n51\nBut  while  the  warrantless  surveillance  of  foreign  individuals  abroad  under \nthe  circumstances  that  existed  here  presents  no  cognizable  constitutional \nproblem,  we  must  nevertheless  still  consider  what  protections  the  Fourth \nAmendment  provides  individuals  located  within  the  United  States  who \ncommunicate  with  the  foreign  individuals  abroad  lawfully  targeted  under \nSection  702. \nThe  second  Fourth  Amendment  principle  implicated  by  incidental \ncollection  speaks  directly  to  that  concern.  The  Fourth  Amendment  generally  is \nnot violated  when  law  enforcement  officers,  having  lawfully  undertaken \nelectronic  surveillance,  whether  under  the  authority  of  a  warrant or  an  exception \nto  the  warrant  requirement,  discover  and  seize  either  evidence  of  criminal \nactivity  that  they  would  not  have had  probable  cause  to  search  for  in  the  first \nplace,  or  the  relevant  conversations  of  an  individual  they  did  not  anticipate  or \nname  in  a  warrant  application.  See,  e.g.,  United  States  v.  Donovan,  429  U.S,  413,  427 \n&  n.15  (1977}  (noting,  as  to  domestic  wiretaps,  “[i]t  is  not  a  constitutional \nrequirement  that  ali  those  likely  to  be  overheard  engaging  in  incriminating \nconversations  be  named.”);  United  States  v.  Figueroa,  757  F.2d  466,  472  (2d  Cir. \n1985)  (“More  particularly,  the  mere  fact  that  Title  III  allows  interception  of \na2\nconversations  of  ‘others  as  yet  unknown’  does  not  render  the  statute \nunconstitutional!  on  its  face  as  authorizing  a  general  warrant.”). \nThis  line  of cases  has  come  to  be  known  as  the  “incidental  overhear” \ndoctrine.  See,  e.9.,  Suppression  Decision,  2016  WL  1029500  at  *9  (noting  that \n“{c]ourts  have  long  dealt  with  the  issue  of incidental  interception  of non-targeted \npersons’  communications”  and  collecting  cases).  Courts  have  repeatedly  held \nthat  law  enforcement  agents  do  not  need  to  obtain  a  separate  warrant to  collect \nconversations  of  persons  as  to  whom probable  cause  did  not  previously  exist \nwith  individuals  whose  oral  or  wire  communications  are  being  collected  through \na  lawful  wiretap  or  bug,  where  those  conversations  on  their  face  contain \nevidence  of  criminal  activity.’”  See,  e.g.,  Donovan,  429  U.S.  at  427  &  n.15;  Figueroa, \n757 F.2d  at 472;  see  also  In  re  Certified  Question  of Law,  858  F.3d  605  (FISA  Ct.  Rev. \n2016)  (finding  incidental  collection  of  content  information  reasonable  where \nwarrant  was  obtained  only  for  non-content  dialing  information);  United  States  v. \n  \n17  The  “incidental  overhear”  doctrine  is  closely  related  to  the  “plain  view” \ndoctrine  applied  in  connection  with  physical  searches,  See,  e.g.,  Coolidge  v.  New \nHampshire,  403  U.S.  443,  465-67  (1971)  (describing  plain  view  doctrine  and  noting \nthat  “[t}he  doctrine  serves  to  supplement  the  prior  justification  —  whether  it  be \na  warrant  ...,  hot  pursuit,  search  incident  to  lawful  arrest,  or  some  other \nlegitimate  reason  for  being  present  unconnected  with  a  search  directed  against \nthe  accused  —  and  permits  the  warrantless seizure.”).  \n53\nStewart,  590  F.3d  93,  129  (2d  Cir.  2009)  (concluding,  in  challenge  to  Title  I  FISA \nsurveillance,  that  “[b}ecause  Stewart's  co-conspirators  were  targeted  pursuant  to \nproper procedures,  the  Fourth  Amendment  did  not  require  that  Stewart  also  be \nidentified  or  described  as a  target  in  order  for  her  intercepted  conversations  to  be \nused  in  a  criminal  prosecution.”)  (internal  citation  omitted). \nCombining  these  two  Fourth  Amendment  principles,  the  government  may \nlawfully  collect,  without a  warrant  and  pursuant  to  Section  702,  the  e-mails  of \nforeign  individuals  located  abroad  who  reasonably  appear  to  constitute  a \npotential  threat  to  the  United  States  and,  once  it  is  lawfully  collecting  those  e- \nmails,  it  does  not  need  to  seek  a  warrant,  supported  by  probable  cause,  to \ncontinue  to  collect  e-mails  between  that  person  and  other  individuals  once  it  is \nlearned  that  some  of  those  individuals  are  United  States  citizens  or  lawful \npermanent  residents,  or  are  located  in  the  United  States.  Accord  Mohamud,  843 \nF.3d  at 441;  see  also  United  States  v.  Mohammad,  339  F.  Supp.  3d  724,  748-49  (N.D. \nOhio  2018)  (applying  Verdugo-Urquidez  and  rejecting  Fourth  Amendment \nchallenge  to  Section  702  surveillance  where,  despite  marriage  to  United  States \ncitizen,  defendant  lived  abroad  at  time  of  offense);  Linited  States  v.  Muhtorov,  187 \nF,  Supp.  3d  1240,  1258  (D.  Colo.  2015)  (rejecting  facial  and  as  applied  challenge  to \n54\nincidental  collection  under  Section  702  and  concluding  that  a  warrant  was  not \nacquired  and  search  as  reasonable).  That  is  the  case  even  if  the  government \nwould  have  needed,  but  did  not  have,  a  warrant or  probable  cause  had  it  sought \nto  collect  the  e-mails  of  the  American  third  party  in  the  first  instance.  Cf  In  re \nCertified  Question,  858  F.3d  at 604  (framing  constitutional  issue  as  whether \nincidental  content  collection  rendered  primary  dialing  information  collection \nunreasonable,  not  whether  warrant  would  have  been  required  for  content \ncollection  in  its  own  right). \nObjecting  to  this  conclusion,  Hasbajrami  and  amici  advance  several \narguments  seeking  to  apply  the  warrant  requirement  to  Hasbajrami’s  case.  Each \nis  unavailing. \nFirst,  they  argue  that  Verdugo-Urqutdez  does  not  control  the  outcome here \nbecause  Section  702  collection  occurs  in  the  United  States,  Practically  speaking, \nSection  702  surveillance  could  occur  only  within  the  United  States,  as  the  agencies \ncan  compel  only  ISPs  located  in  the  United  States  to  provide  e-mails. \nBut  Fourth  Amendment doctrine  relating  to  wire  or  electronic \ncommunication  does  not  focus  on  the  location  where  the  communication  takes \nplace.

United  States,  389  U.S.  347  (1967),  the  seminal  Supreme  Court \n55\noe BLEOTN Y  yMEy S T Stya ryT RA beE Sm,n   8 PMEAR r e sSe,e  , \nBAR  TE  ak Rt Ae \ndecision  on  the  interception  of  such  communication,  holds  that  a  person’s \nprivacy  interest  in  his  or  her  communications  does  not  depend  on  whether  the \ngovernment  physically  intrudes  into  a  physical  space  in  which  that  person  has  a \nproperty  interest  or  an  expectation  of  physical  privacy.  What  matters,  and  what \nimplicates  the  protection  of  the  Fourth  Amendment,  is  the  expectation  of  privacy \nin  the  communications  themselves,  and  therefore  a  warrantis   required  to  seize \neven  those  communications  made  in  a  public  telephone  booth.  Conversely,  by \nthe  same  reasoning,  a  person  who  does  not  have  a  Fourth  Amendment-protected \nprivacy  interest  in  his  communications,  such  as  a  foreign  national  resident \nabroad,  does  not  acquire  such  an  interest  by  reason  of  the  physical  location  of  the \nintercepting device.  At  least where  the  communication  is  collected  essentially  in \nreal  time  as  it  occurs,  the  targeted  communication,  whether  conducted  over \ntelephone  wires  or  via  the  internet,  occurs  in  the  relevant  sense  where  the  person \nwhose  calls  or e-mails  are  being  intercepted  is  located,  regardless  of  the  location \nof  the  means  used  to  intercept  it. \nSecond,  Hasbajrami  argues  that  the surveillance  cannot be  properly \nconsidered  “incidental”  where  the  government  can  or  even  does  expect  to  collect \nconversations  with  people  with  ties  to  the  United  States  or  located  within  its \n56\nwean \n yo tap ea\nborders.  While  we  have  concerns,  expressed  below,  about  the  potential  scope  of \nSection  702  surveillance,  those  concerns  are  less  applicable  where,  as  here, \ncollection  and  review  are  occurring  nearly  contemporaneously  and  that \ncollection  is  ancillary  to  lawful  surveillance  of a  permitted  target.  In  the  nature  of \nlaw enforcement,  there  is  always  a  possibility  that  the  collection  of evidence \nagainst  a  person  who  there  is  already  probable  cause  to  believe  is  involved  in \ncriminal  activity  or  who  is  otherwise  legitimately  subject  to  surveillance  will  also \ndevelop  information  about  others  not previously  reasonably  suspected  of \nwrongdoing.  There  is  no  contention here  that  the  Section  702  surveillance  was \nundertaken  as  a  pretext  to  collect  the  communications  of  Hasbajrami,  or  of  any \nother  identified  United  States  person  or  person  located  in  the  United  States.  That \nthe  overall  practice  of  surveilling  foreigners  abroad  of  interest  to  the  legitimate \npurpose  of  gathering  foreign  intelligence  information  may  predictably  lead  to  the \ninterception  of  communications  with  United  States  persons  no  more  invalidates \nthat practice,  or  requires  the  government  to  cease  its  surveillance  of  the  target \nuntil  a  warrant  is  obtained,  than  the  general  foreseeability  of  intercepting \ncommunications  with  previously  unknown  co-conspirators  undermines  the \ninadvertent  overhear  doctrine  in  ordinary  domestic  criminal  wiretapping. \n57\nFinally,  Hasbajrami  and  amici  seek  to  distinguish  the  “incidental  overhear” \nline  of cases,  noting  that  in  those  cases  there  was  already  an  initial  warrant \nsupported  by  probable  cause.  They  agree,  however,  that  “the  incidental  overhear \ncases  simply  stand  for  the  proposition  that  the  government  need  not  obtain \nmultiple  warrants  to  intercept  protected  communications.”  Brief  of  Amici  Curiae \nAmerican  Civil  Liberties  Union  and  Electronic  Frontier  Foundation  at  15,  United \nStates  v.  Hasbajrami,  No.  15-2684  (2d  Cir.  Oct.  23,  2017)  (emphasis  in  original). \nThat  is  exactly  the  point  here:  once  that  initial  surveillance  is  rendered  lawful  by \na  warrant,  a  FISC  order,  or  some  other  exception  to  the  warrant  requirement,  an \nadditional  warrant  is  not  necessary  in  order  to  collect  the  calls  or  e-mails  of  third \nparties.  As  the  district  court recognized,  once  the  surveillance  was  “lawful  in  the \nfirst  place  —whether  it  is  the  domestic  surveillance  of  U.S.  persons  pursuant  to  a \nwarrant  or  the  warrantless  surveillance  of  non-U.S.  persons  who  are  abroad  — \nthe  incidental  interception  of  non-targeted  U.S,  persons‘  communications  with \nthe  targeted  persons  is  also  lawful.”  Suppression  Decision,  2016  WL  1029500  at  *9, \nThe  reason  why  the  initial  surveillance  was  lawful  does  not  matter  to  this \nconclusion. \n58\nAccordingly,  the  incidental  collection  of  United  States  persons’  e-mails \nduring  lawful  foreign  intelligence  surveillance  of  foreigners  located  abroad  is not \nper  se  unreasonable  because  the  collection  is  done  without  a  warrant. \nB.  Incidental  Collection  of  E-mails  under  Section  702  is  Reasonable \nEven  absent  a  warrant  requirement,  however,  the  government's  action \nmust  still  be  reasonable,  at  least  insofar  as  it  affects  United  States  persons,  to  be \nconsistent  with  the  Fourth  Amendment.  King,  569  U.S.  at  448.  “To  determine \nwhether  a  search  is  reasonable  under  the  Fourth  Amendment,  we  examine  the \ntotality  of  the  circumstances  to  balance,  on  the  one  hand,  the  degree  to  which  it \nintrudes  upon  an  individual's  privacy  and,  on  the  other,  the  degree  to  which  it  is \nneeded  for  the  promotion  of  legitimate  government  interests.”  In  re  Terrorist \nBombings,  552  F.3d  at  172  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted). \nFor  the  purposes  of  Hasbajrami’s  appeal,  we  may  assume  that  a  United \nStates  person  ordinarily  has  a  reasonable  expectation  in  the  privacy  of  his  e-mails \nsufficient  to  trigger  a  Fourth  Amendment reasonableness  inquiry  when  the \ngovernment undertakes  to  monitor  even  foreign  communications  in  a  way  that \ncan  be  expected  to,  and  in  fact  does,  lead  to  the  interception  of  communications \nwith  United  States  persons.  See,  ¢.9.,  United  States  v.  Warshak,  631  F.3d  266,  285-86 \n59\nS2 onosJla t o  wPeeerteer  aseS  \n1  ,  aha Sar Sat eat \n(6th  Cir.  2010)  (analogizing  between  letters  and  e-mails  and  finding  reasonable \nexpectation  of  privacy).  In  other  words,  we  can  assume  that  the  government  may \nnot  eavesdrop,  without  reasonable  justification,  on  the  conversations  of  United \nStates  persons  (even  abroad)  with  foreign  nationals,  simply  because  the  United \nStates  person  is  interacting  with  a  foreigner.  Even  assuming  that  a  United  States \nperson  might  be  understood  to  take  some  risk  that  the  person  with  whom  he  or \nshe  is  communicating  is  under  surveillance,  it  does  not  follow  that  an  American \ncommunicating  with  a  foreign  national  must  take  the  risk  that  the  person  with \nwhom  he  is  communicating  is  subject  to  unreasonable,  or  indiscriminate, \nelectronic  surveillance,  or  that  communicating  with foreigners  subjects  the \nAmerican  national  himself  or herself to  continuing  surveillance. \nBut  such  a  privacy  interest  can  be  outweighed by  the  government's \n“manifest  need  to  monitor”  the  communications  of  foreign agents  of  terrorist \norganizations  operating  abroad,  and  this  need  outweighs  that  interest  in  privacy \nand  makes  the  incidental  collection  of  communications  between  such  foreigners \nand  United  States  persons  reasonable.  In  re  Terrorist  Bombings,  552  F.3d  at  172. \nEven  in  the  context  of  conventional  warfare,  identifying  domestic  agents  of \nforeign powers  is  a  principal  concern  of  intelligence-gathering.  The  need  to \n60\nB27  bet  eed \nTE oy  ako tae  &  \"\nidentify  potential  domestic  co-conspirators  of  hostile  foreign  persons  or  groups  is \neven greater  in  the  context  of  informal  non-state  terrorist  organizations  and \nmovements.  The  recruitment  of persons  inside  the  United  States  or  the  placement \nof  agents  here  to  carry  out  terrorist  attacks  is  one  of  the  very  threats  that  make  it \nvital  to  surveil  terrorist  actors  abroad.  The  communications  of  terrorist \noperatives  abroad  with  persons  inside  the  United  States  is  thus  of  particular \nimportance,  and  at  least  as  important  as  monitoring  the  communications  of \nforeign  terrorists  abroad  among  themselves.\"* \nThe  logic  of  this  conclusion  is  clear  and  compelling.  If  it  is  reasonable  — \nand  indeed  necessary  to  the  national  security  —  for  intelligence  agencies  to \nmonitor  the  communications  of  suspected  foreign  terrorists  abroad,  the  need  to \nkeep  track  of  the potential  threat  from  abroad  does  not  lessen  because  some  of \nthe  suspect’s  contacts  turn  out  to  be  American nationals,  or  foreign  nationals \nlocated  within  the  United  States.  And  when  the  conversations  being  monitored \n  \n18  The  same  reasoning  defeats  any  argument  that  such  monitoring  should  be \nlimited  to  the  acquisition  of  foreign  intelligence,  and  that  communications \ncollected  for  that  purpose  should  not  be  made  available  to  domestic  law \nenforcement  agencies.  There  is  little  point  in having  intelligence  agencies  collect \ninformation  abroad  if  those  agencies  are  not  able  to  share  what  they  learn  with \ndomestic  law  enforcement  when  the  information  they  acquire  points  to  ongoing \nor  impending  criminal  activities  inside  our  borders. \n61 \nconstitute  evidence  of criminal  conspiracies  between  the  foreign  operative  and \nsomeone  located  within  the  United  States,  the  urgency  becomes  greater,  not  less. \nThe  logic  of  the  plain  view  and  inadvertent  overhear  cases  fully  applies:  when  an \nofficer  executing  a  lawful  search or  electronic  surveillance  warrant,  or  otherwise \nengaged  in  a  lawful  search,  comes  upon  evidence  of  a  previously  unsuspected \ncrime,  or  learns  of  the  mvolvement  of  a  previously  unsuspected  individual,  the \nofficer  is  not  required  to  stop  and  obtain  a  new  warrant  to  seize  the  item or  to \ncontinue  monitoring  the  phone  line  for  which  the  warrant  was  obtained.  The \nseizure  of  evidence  of a  crime  in  plain  view  without  a  warrant  is  a  reasonable \nseizure.  In  the  same  way,  when  evidence  of  a  potential  crime  involving  an \nAmerican  comes  to  light  during  the  lawful  surveillance  of  a  foreign  operative \nabroad,  it  is  entirely  reasonable  within  the  meaning  of  the  Fourth  Amendment \nfor  the  government  to  continue  monitoring  the  conversations  of  that  operative \nwith  the  American  as  well  as  with  his  or  her  other  associates.” \n  \n”  Of  course,  if  the  government  wishes  to  expand  the  investigation  to  monitor  the \ncommunications  of  the  newly  discovered  United  States-connected  suspect,  it \nwould  be  required  to  obtain  a  conventional  Title  [II  or  traditional  FISA  warrant \n62\nIn  balancing  Hasbajrami’s  privacy  interest  with  the  government's  concern \nfor national  security,  then,  we  conclude  that  the  totality  of  the  circumstances  here \nweighs  in  the  government’s  favor.  The  incidental  collection  of  communications \nbetween targeted  foreigners  abroad  and  United  States  persons  or  persons  in  the \nUnited  States  is  thus  reasonable.  For  similar reasons,  when the  intelligence \ninformation properly  collected  raises  reasonable  grounds  to  believe  that  a  crime \nis  being  committed  or  planned  in  the  United  States,  dissemination  of  the \ninformation  to  a  domestic  law enforcement  agency  such  as  the  FBI  is  also \nreasonable. \nIn  summary,  the  district  court  reached  the  correct  conclusions  regarding \nincidental  collection:  the  initial  targeting  of  individuals  without  ties  to  the  United \nStates  and  located  abroad  is  lawful;  there  is  no  need  for  a  warrant  in  order  to \ncollect incidental  communications  by  United  States persons  to  and  from  those \nindividuals;  and  both  the  collection  of  such  communications  and  the \ndissemination  of  information  from  such  collection  about  potential  criminal \nactions  within the  country  to  domestic  law  enforcement  are  reasonable  under  the \nFourth Amendment.  Were  such  incidental  collection the  only  Section  702 \nmaterial  relevant  to  Hasbajrami’s  motion,  we  would  simply  affirm  the  district \n63\n2 ~  &  RFAiARRL   So OPASSGasEr    ~MR e erRemSEi e PEsSsTe it roa s ifoyb   ffneeo    wTroasae t ee \\ e  eLye \ncourt's  ruling.  But,  as  the  record  currently  stands,  we  must  also  consider \nadditional  issues. \nIi.  “Inadvertent”  Collection \nThe  district  court’s  ruling  on  the  suppression  motion  did  not  address \nwhether  any  e-mail  accounts  of  United  States  persons  or  individuals  within  the \nUnited  States,  including  Hasbajraini,  had  been  “inadvertently”  targeted,  that  is, \ntargeted  by  mistake  under  the  presumption  that  an  address  was  controlled  by  a \nnon-United  States  person. \nUpon  reviewing  the  classified  record,  in particular  its  ex  parte  proceedings \nunder  the  Classified  Information  Procedures  Act  (“CIPA”),  18  U.S.C.  app.  3,  §  1  et \nseq.,  it  is  clear  that  the  district  court  was  made  aware  of  one  instance  of  the  direct \ntargeting  of  an  e-mail  account  controlled  by  a  United  States  person  that  resulted \nin  the  collection  of  Hasbajrami’s  communications.  Before  the  incidental  collection \ndiscussed  above,  the  NSA  had  directly  targeted  at  least  one  such  e-mail  address. \nLike  the  later  incidental  collection,  the  NSA  had  originally  been  monitoring \ncommunications  with  individuals  it  reasonably  believed  were  non-United  States \npersons  located  abroad,  and  as  a  result  discovered  an  e-mail  from  the  United \nStates  person.  At  that  time,  however,  NSA  analysts concluded,  wrongly,  that the \n64\naccount holder  was  not  a  United  States  person.  The  NSA  therefore  tasked  the \naccount  (a  different  account  than  those  that  were  the  subject  of  incidental \ncollection  detailed  above)  in  its  own  right,  and  collected  communications  from \nthe  account  for  several  weeks.  The  agency  eventually  detasked  the  account  after \nit  concluded  it  was  not  yielding  significant  intelligence  information,  but  it  did \nnot  initially  purge  the  information  because  it  did  not  discover  until  later  that  the \naccount  holder  was  a  United  States  person.  The  related  Section  702-acquired \nmaterial,  which  included  communications  to  and/or  from  Hasbajrami,  stayed  in \nNSA  databases,  however,  and  was  not  disseminated  to  domestic  law \nenforcement,  until  the  agency  conducted  a  search  of  these  databases  in  2014 \nfollowing  the  initiation  of  Hasbajrami’s  prosecution. \nThe  inadvertent  collection  of  communications  raises  complicated \nquestions.  First,  as  a  statutory  matter,  Section  702  prohibits  the  targeting  of e- \nmail  accounts  that  the  government  knows  to  be  maintained  by  United  States \npersons.  See  50  U.S.C.  §  1881a(b).  But  the  statute  thus  appears  to  prohibit  only \nknowing  or  intentional  targeting,  and  not  to  address  situations  where  the \ngovernment  is  mistaken,  reasonably  or  unreasonably.  Does  the  express \nprohibition  of  targeting  accounts  known  to  be  those  of  United  States  persons \n65\nimplicitly  authorize  the  targeting  of  any  account  not  known  with  certainty  to  be \nthat  of  a  United  States  person?  If  there  is  evidence  of  a  high  likelihood  that  the \naccount  belongs  to  a  United  States  person  and  the  government  proceeds  to  target \nit  without  taking  steps  to  investigate  further,  does  the  willful  blindness  standard, \nwhich  equates  such  deliberate  indifference  to  actual  knowledge  in  many  legal \ncontexts,  apply?  Cf.  Global-Tech  Appliances,  Inc.  v.  SEB  S.A.,  563  U.S.  754,  766-69 \n(2011)  (discussing  willful  blindness  doctrine). \nSecond,  the  Fourth  Amendment  calculus  for  such  collection  would  be \ndifferent  than  the  one  employed  in  considering  incidental  collection.  Incidental \ncollection  is  justified  because  the  “target”  of  the  surveillance  cannot  rely  on  the \nFourth  Amendment's  protections,  as  discussed  above.  But  a  United  States  citizen \nor  lawful  permanent  resident,  located  in  the  United  States,  assuming  a \nreasonable  expectation  of  privacy,  would  be  protected  by  the  Fourth \nAmendment.  Is  the  Fourth Amendment  prohibition  of  “unreasonable”  searches \nviolated  if  the  government  unreasonably  (recklessly  or  negligently)  concludes \nthat  the  targeted  account  is  that  of a  foreigner  located  abroad?  Is  it  permissible \nfor  the  government  to  adopt  a  presumption  that,  under  all  circumstances  or  in \nthe  presence  of  one  or  more  key  indicia,  an  account  holder  whose  identity  is \n66\nunclear  should be  treated  as  foreign?  Would  the  later  discovery  that  the  account \ndid  indeed  belong  to  a  United  States  person  require  the  minimization,  or  the \nsuppression  in  a  criminal  case,  of  inadvertently  collected conversations? \nA  district  court  reviewing  a  motion  to  suppress  evidence  inadvertently \ncollected  (or  derived  from  inadvertent  collection)  would  have  to  address  these \nissues,  and  perhaps  others,  in deciding  whether  the  government's  reliance  on \ninadvertent  collection  in  an  investigation  or  prosecution  was  reasonable  within \nthe  meaning  of  the  Fourth  Amendment. \nBut  we  need  not decide  those  questions  today  because  we  are  satisfied  that \nany  inadvertent  collection  disclosed  to  the  district court  was  harmless.  The \ninterception  of  communications  from  the  inadvertently  targeted  account  was \nbrief,  lasting  only  approximately  two  weeks.  The  materials  collected,  whatever \nthey  were,  were  not  used  in  applying  for  the  FISA  warrant  —  indeed,  their  very \nexistence  seems  to  have  been  unknown  to  anyone  involved  in  the  criminal \ninvestigation  of  Hasbajrami,  as  the  inadvertent  targeting  of  the  account  in \nquestion  was  not  even  discovered  by  the  government  until  well  into  the \nprosecution  of  this  case.  And  finally,  the  collection  was  terminated  because  the \ngovernment itself determined  that  nothing  of  any  intelligence  value  was  being \n67\nlearned.  Presumably  that  conclusion  would not  have  been  reached  if  the \ncollected  conversations  were  indicative  of  criminal  terrorist  plots,  or  were  of \nevidentiary  value  to  a  criminal  investigation. \nThus,  even  assuming  arguendo  that  there  was  some  legal  infirmity  in  the \ndecision  to  begin collection  despite  uncertainty  about the  status  of  the  account,  or \nto  continue  it once  at  least  some  evidence  pointing  to  a  possible  United  States \nsource  for  the  account  was  discovered,  we  conclude,  even  in  the  context of  a \nconditional  guilty  plea,  that  the  failure  to  suppress  the  results  of  that  collection \nwas  harmless  beyond  any  reasonable  doubt. \nIII.  Querying \nThere  is  a  third  issue  in  this  case,  however:  the  storage  of  Section  702 \ninformation  in  databases  and  the  subsequent  querying  of those  databases  by  the \ngovernment.  The  district  court  did  not  make  any  findings  regarding  whether  the \nNSA,  the  FBI  or  any  other  agency  queried  databases  with  regard  to  Hasbajrami \nprior  to  the  FISC  order.  Instead,  it  appeared  to  accept  the  government's \nargument,  framed  within  the  context  of  a  discussion  of  whether  the  minimization \nprocedures  provided  adequate  protections  so  as  to  make  collection  reasonable, \nthat  the  government  could  freely  query  information  it  had  lawfully  acquired \n68\nwithout  further  Fourth  Amendment  inquiry.  See  Suppresston  Decision,  2016  WL \n1029500  at  *12  n.20  (“I  agree  with  the  government  that  it  would  be  perverse  to \nauthorize  the  unrestricted  review  of  lawfully  collected  information  but  then \nrestrict  the  targeted  review  of  the  same  information  in  response  to  tailored \ninquires.”)  {internal  alterations  and  quotation  marks  omitted). \nThe  government  renewed  this  argument  on  appeal.  Following  oral \nargument,  during  which  the  goverment  would  neither  confirm  nor  deny \nwhether  it  had  queried  any  databases  of  Section  702-acquired  information,  this \n \n \nCourt  ordered  further  bricfing.  The  gove rnment  $y \n \nGov't  Supplemental  Classified  Br.  at  6-7  (emphasis  added).  Sy \n69\nLike  inadvertent  collection,  the  storage  and  querying  of  information  raises \nchallenging  constitutional  questions,  to  which  there  are  few  clear  answers  in the \ncase  law.  Cf.  In  re  Directives,  551  F.3d  at  1015  (dismissing  petitioner's  concerns, \nunder  the  PAA,  because  the  “government  assures  us  that  it  does  not  maintain  a \ndatabase  of  incidentally  collected  information  from  non-targeted  United  States \npersons,  and  there  is  no  evidence  to  the  contrary.”).  The  issue  was  not  addressed \nby  the  Ninth  Circuit  in Mohamud,  which  explicitly  left  open  the  question  of \nwhether  “the  incidental  overhear  doctrine  permits  the  unconstitutional  and \nwidespread  retention  and  querying  of  the  incidentally  collected  information,” \nstating  that  the  issue  was  “not  before  [the  court].”  843  F.3d  at  440  n.24.  The \ndistrict  court in  Mohamud  did  reach  the  question,  however,  and  it  concluded  that \nthe  “subsequent  querying  of  a  §  702  collection,  even  if  U.S.  person  identifiers  are \nused,  is  not  a  separate  search  and  does  not  make  §  702  surveillance  unreasonable \nunder  the  Fourth  Amendment.”  United  States  v.  Mohamud,  No.  3:10-cr-475-KI-1, \n2014  WL  2866749,  at  *26  (D.  Or.  June  24,  2014),  aff'd,  843 F.3d  420  (9th  Cir.  2016). \nWe  do  not  find  that  logic  persuasive.  Storage  has  little  significance  in  its \nown  Tight:  the  lawfully-collected  communications,  even  of  United  States  persons, \ncontinue  to  serve  the  same  foreign  intelligence  purpose  in  the  continued \n70\nsurveillance  of  a  foreign  operative,  whether  his  interlocutor  is  a  United  States \nperson  or  a  citizen  and  resident  of  some  other  country.  The  material  is  justifiably \nretained,  not  to  keep  tabs  on  a  United  States  person,  but  to  keep  tabs  on  the  non- \nUnited  States  person  abroad  who  has  been  targeted.” \nBut  querying  that  stored  data  does  have  important  Fourth  Amendment \nimplications,  and  those  implications  counsel  in  favor  of  considering  querying  a \nseparate  Fourth  Amendmentevent  that,  in  itself,  must  be  reasonable.  Our \nreasoning  is  based  on  three  considerations. \nFirst,  courts  have  increasingly  recognized  the  need  for  additional  probable \ncause  or  reasonableness  assessments  to  support  a  search  of  information  or  objects \nthat  the  government  has  lawfully  collected.  It  is  true  that  the  FBI  does  not  need \nan  additional  warrant  to  go  down  to  its  evidence  locker  and  look  through  a box \nof  evidence  it  collected  from  a  crime  scene.  But  lawful  collection  alone  is  not \nalways  enough  to  justify  a  future  search. \nIn  Riley  v.  California,  the  Supreme  Court  held  that  a  warrant  was  necessary \nto  search  a  cell  phone,  even  when  that  cell  phone  was  lawfully  seized  pursuant  to \n20  The  considerations  might  be  different  if  the  storage  involved  data  responsive  to \na  warrant  and  retained  for  the  purpose  of  a  domestic  criminal  prosecution.  This \nCourt,  sitting  en  banc,  considered  similar  issues  in  United  States  v.  Ganias,  824  F.3d \n199  (2d  Cir.  2016),  although  we  ultimately  did  not  need  to  decide  them. \n71\na  search  incident  to  a  lawful  arrest.  573  U.S.  373,  401  (2014).  Several  circuit  court \ndecisions  have  reached  similar  conclusions.  In  United  States  v.  Sedaghaty,  for \ninstance,  the  government  had  searched  a  defendant’s  home  pursuant  to  a \nwarrant  focused  on  tax  violations.  728  F.3d  885,  912  (9th  Cir.  2013).  Agents  seized \nnine  computers,  which  forensic  experts  searched  with  “an  evolving  list  of  search \nterms”  in  order  “to  comb  through  the  computers  for  useful  materials,” \neventually  finding  evidence  confirming  the  defendant  was  supporting  Chechen \nterrorist  groups.  Id.  The  Ninth  Circuit  concluded  that  the  searches  beyond  the \nscope  of  the  warrant  were  improper,  noting  that  the  government  “should  not be \nable  to  comb  through  [the  defendant's]  computers  plucking  out  new  forms  of \nevidence  that  the  investigating  agents  have  decided  may  be  useful”  after  it  failed \nto  find  evidence  of  willfulness  regarding  the  tax  returns.  Id.  at  913.  To  do  so \nrequired  a  new  warrant,  even  though  the  government  already  had  access  to  the \nmachines  and  had  lawfully  seized  them.  See also  United  States  v.  Runyan,  275  F.3d \n449,  464-65  (5th  Cir.  2001)  (finding  that  police  exceeded  the  scope  of  a  private \nsearch when they  “examined  disks  that  the  private  searchers  did  not  examine” \nand  would  have  required  a  warrant  to  do  so);  United  States  v.  Mulder,  808  F.2d \n1346,  1349  (2d  Cir.  1987)  (holding  that  a  separate  warrant  was  needed  to  test \n72\npackages  in  suitcase  for  drugs,  even  though  the  suitcase  was  lawfully  seized  via \nprivate  search). \nSecond,  Section  702  is  sweeping  in  its  technological  capacity  and  broad  in \nits  scope.  In  the  case  of  the  incidental  collection  discussed  above,  P|  was \ncollecting  and  reviewing  e-mails  for  its  own  foreign  intelligence  purposes  in \nGE,  206  reporting Ge vidence  that  it  obtained  suggesting \non-going  criminal  activity  in  the  United  States.  Such  activity  is  closely  analogous \nto  precedents  drawn  from  traditional  domestic  criminal  wiretapping.  As \ndiscussed  above,  it  is  not  difficult  to  conclude  that,  like  “incidentally  overheard” \ncriminal  conversations  and  evidence  of  crimes  seized  in  plain  view,  the  collection \nand  use  of  information  obtained  in  this  way  is  reasonable  within  the  meaning  of \nthe  Fourth  Amendment. \nBut  the  vast  technological  capabilities  of  the  Section  702  program, \nestimated  by  the  PCLOB  as  totaling  nearly  250  million  e-mails  annually  by  2011 \nand  likely  larger  numbers  since  then,  may  mean  that  analysts  are  not  reviewing \neach  of those  e-mails  contemporaneously  with  their  collection.  PCLOB  Report  at \n116,  128-29.  If  such  a  vast  body  of  information  is  simply  stored  in  a  database, \navailable  for  review  by  request  from  domestic  law  enforcement  agencies  solely \n73\non  the  speculative  possibility  that  evidence  of interest  to  agents  investigating  a \nparticular individual  might be  found  there,  the  program  begins  to  look  more  like \na  dragnet,  and  a  query  more  like  a  general  warrant,  and  less  like  an  individual \nofficer  going  to  the  evidence  locker  to  check  a  previousl!y-acquired  piece  of \nevidence  against  some  newfound  insight. \nThe  Supreme  Court  has  expressed  increasing  concern  about  the  interaction \nbetween  Fourth  Amend ment  precedent  and  evolving  government technological \ncapabilities.  Riley  rested  in  part on  the  fact that  “[c]ell  phones.  .  .  place  vast \nquantities  of  personal  information  literally  in  the  hands  of  individuals.”  573  U.S. \nat  386.  “A  search of  the  information  on  a  cell  phone  [therefore]  bears  little \nresemblance  to  the  type  of  physical  search  considered”  in  past  cases.  Id.;  see  also \nGanias,  824  F.3d  at  217-18  (noting  privacy  implications  of  expansive  technology \nand  data  storage).  And  in  Carpenter,  the  Court  concluded  that  a  warrant  (ora \nvalid  substitute)  was  required  to  acquire  cell-site  records,  even  though  they  were \nstored  by  a  third  party  and  under  traditional  Fourth Amendment  doctrine  a \ncellphone  user  would  not  have  an  expectation  of privacy  in  such  information: \nWe  decline  to  grant  the  state  unrestricted  access  to  a \nwireless  carrier’s  database  of  physical  location \ninformation.  In  light  of  the  deeply  revealing  nature  of \n[this  information],  its  depth,  breadth,  and \n74\ncomprehensive  reach,  and  the  inescapable  and \nautomatic  nature  of  its  collection,  the  fact  that  such \ninformation  is  gathered  by  a  third  party  does  not  make \nit  any  less  deserving  of  Fourth  Amendment  protection. \nThe  Government's  acquisition  of  the  cell-site  records \nhere  was  a  Search under  that  Amendment. \nCarpenter  v.  United  States,  138  S.  Ct,  2206,  2223  (2018). \nThird,  as  a  practical  matter,  querying  is  problematic  because  it  may  make \nit  easier  to  target wide-ranging information about  a  given  United  States  person at \na  point  when  the  government knows it  is  investigating  such  a  person.  Section  702 \nforbids  the  government  from  targeting  a  non-United  States  person  as  a  backdoor \nway  of  targeting  a  United  States  person.  50  U.S.C.  §  1881a(b).  But,  as  detailed \nabove,  in  the  course  of  its  intelligence  gathering  operations,  the  NSA  may  have \ncollected  all  sorts  of  information  about  an individual,  the  sum  of  which may \nresemble  what the  NSA  would  have  gathered  if  it  had  directly targeted  that \nindividual  in  the  first  place.  To  permit  that  information  to  be  accessed \nindiscriminately,  for  domestic  law  enforcement  purposes,  without  any  reason  to \nbelieve  that  the  individual  is  involved  in  any  criminal  activity  and  or  even  that \nany  information  about  the  person  is  likely  to  be  in  the  database,  just  to  see  if \nthere  is  anything  incriminating  in  any  conversations  that  might  happen  to  be \nthere,  would  be  at  odds  with  the  bedrock  Fourth  Amendment  concept  that  law \n75\nenforcement  agents  may  not  invade  the  privacy  of  individuals  without  some \nobjective  reason  to  believe  that  evidence  of  crime  will  be  found  by  a  search. \nTreating  querying  as  a  Fourth  Amendment  event  and  requiring  the  query  itself \nto  be  reasonable  provides  a  backstop  to  protect  the  privacy  interests  of  United \nStates  persons  and  ensure  that  they  are  not being  improperly  targeted. \nFourth,  much  may  depend  on  who  is  querying  what  database.  There  is  a \npotentially  significant  difference  between,  for  example,  the  FBI  querying  its  own \ndatabase  and  the  FBI  requesting  that  the  NSA  query  its  far  larger  archive  of \ncollected  communications,  collected  pursuant to  a  broader  mandate.  As  we \nunderstand  the  public  sources  of  information  about  the  collection  and  use  of \nSection  702  material,  the  FBI  maintains  its  own  records  of  communications \nprovided  to  it  by  the  NSA.  See  PCLOB  Report  at  58-59.  Such  communications \npresumably  were  provided  because  review  of  the  material  properly  collected  by \nthe  NSA  under  Section  702  uncovered  evidence  of  critninal  activity  (relating  to \nterrorism  or  otherwise),  and  were  appropriately  communicated  to  domestic  law \nenforcement.  Just  as  the  FBI  may  act  on  such  information  where  it  requires \nimmediate  criminal  investigation,  it  may  well  be  appropriate  for  the  agency  to \nretain  the  information  and  store  it  for  later  review  when  other  legitimate \n76\nevidence  or  leads  make  that  information  relevant  to  an  on-going  investigation. \nSuch  a  review  of  the  agency’s  own  files  is  arguably  analogous  to  traditional  law \nenforcement  techniques;  evidence  lawfully  collected  does  not  always  accumulate \nto  a  sufficient  quantity  to  warrant  an  immediate  arrest  or  indictment,  but  may  be \nretained  and  later  reviewed  when  additional  evidence  is  developed.  FBI  queries \ndirected  to  a  larger archive  of millions  of  communications  collected  and  stored \nby  the  NSA  for  foreign  intelligence  purposes,  on  the  chance  that  something  in \nthose  files  might  contain  incriminating  information  about  a  person  of  interest  to \ndomestic  law  enforcement,  raise  different  concerns. \nWhat  kinds  of querying,  subject  to  what  limitations,  under  what \nprocedures,  are  reasonable  within  the  meaning  of  the  Fourth  Amendment,  and \nwhen  (if  ever)  such  querying  of  one  or  more databases,  maintained  by  an  agency \nof  the  United  States  for  information  about  a  United  States  person,  might  require \na  warrant,  are  difficult  and  sensitive  questions.  We  do  not  purport  to  answer \nthem  here,  or  even  to  canvass  all  of the  considerations  that may  prove  relevant  or \nthe  various  types  of  querying  that  may  raise  distinct  problems. \nIndeed,  we  cannot  do  so  on  the  sparse  record  presented.  We  do  not  know \nwhat  databases  were  queried  by  whom,  for  what  reasons,  what  (if  any) \n77\nay tn \ninformation  was  uncovered  by  such  queries,  or  what  (if any)  use  was  made  of \nany  information  uncovered.  The  government  has  represented  that  no \ninformation  derived  from  any  such  queries  was  presented  to  the  FISC  to  obtain \nthe  FISA  warrant,  but has  not  addressed  whether  any  such  information \ncontributed  to  the  investigation  in  other  ways. \nee \nGiven  these  considerations,  the  district court  here  must  conduct  an  inquiry \ninto  whether  any  querying  of  databases  of  Section  702-acquired  information \nusing  terms  related  to  Hasbajrami  was  lawful  under  the  Fourth  Amendment.  For \ntoday  we  need  only  reiterate  that  “the  ultimate  touchstone  of  the  Fourth \nAmendment  is  reasonableness.”  Riley,  573  U.S.  at 381;  cf.  Abu-Jthaad,  630  F.3d  at \n121-22  (stating  that,  even  in  the  application  of  the  warrant  requirement,  the \nrequirement  is  “flexible,  so  that  different  standards  may  be  compatible  with  the \nFourth  Amendment  in  light  of  the  different  purposes  and  practical \nconsiderations  at  issue.”)  (internal  quotation  marks  and  citations  omitted). \nWe  cannot,  and  should  not,  go  further,  pending  development of  a  more \ncomplete  record  by  the  district  court on  remand,  and  an  assessment  by  the \n78\ndistrict  court  as  to  whether  whatever  was  done  was  consistent  with  the  Fourth \nAmendment  and  whether,  if  there  was  any  illegality,  any  evidence  should have \nbeen suppressed  in  response  to  Hasbajrami’s  motion.7! \nIV.  Hasbajrami’s  Conditional  Plea  and  Resolution  of  the  Motion  to \nSuppress \nAs  addressed  above,  there  is  still  an  open  issue  as  to  what  queries  of \nSection 702-acquired  information  occurred  in  this  case,  whether  any  such  queries \nwere  reasonable  and,  if  unreasonable,  whether  the  queried  information  tainted \nthe  application before  the  FISC  or  in  some  other  way  would  lead  to  the \nsuppression  of  any  evidence. \nBut  in  its  post-argument briefing,  the  government  argues  that  even  if  it  did \nquery  Section  702  databases,  that  action  ultimately  could  not  matter  because  the \n  \n41  On November  14,  2019,  Hasbajrami  filed  a  Rule  28(j)  letter  alerting  this Court \nto  three  recently  declassified  opinions  from  the  FISC  and  FISCR.  See  In  re \nDNI/AG  702(h)  Certifications  2018,  941  F.3d  547  (FISA  Ct.  Rev.  2019);  Redacted \n(FISA  Ct.  Sep.  4,  2019);  Redacted,  2018  WL  9909971  (FISA  Ct.  Oct.  18,  2018).  Based \non our  review,  we  do  not  believe  that  these  opinions  substantively  affect  our \ndecision because,  even  to  the  extent  that  their  approach  differs  from  ours,  they \nare  not binding  on  this  Court.  Since  we  are  remanding  for  the  district  court  to \nfurther  assess  this issue  with  the  benefit  of  a  more  complete  record,  we  decline  to \nengage  further  at  this  time.  We  did  not  find  it  necessary  to  review  the  unredacted \nversions  of  these  opinions  in reaching  this  conclusion  and,  therefore, \nHasbajrami’s  request  for  access  to  the  unredacted  versions  of  these  opinions  is \nDENIED. \n79\ncommunications  collected  as  a  result  of  incidental  collection  would  provide  an \nindependent  source  sufficient  to  support  the  FISC’s  probable  cause \ndetermination.  Gov't  Supplemental  Classified  Br.  at  9  (arguing  that  “this  Court’s \nanalysis  should  be  limited  to  alleged  ‘searches’  where  a  causal  link  can  be  drawn \nbetween  the  search  and  the  acquisition  of  the  evidence  that  Hasbajrami  seeks  to \nsuppress.”). \nThe  government  relies  primarily  on  Murray  v.  United  States,  487  U.S.  533 \n(1988).  In  Murray,  federal  law  enforcement  agents  surveilling  the  defendant \nwitnessed  him  drive  into  a  warehouse  in  South Boston.  /d,  at  535.  Agents \narrested  the  defendant  and  a  co-conspirator  after  they  drove  away  from  the \nwarehouse  and,  upon  arrest,  the  agents  discovered  marijuana  in  the  defendant's \ntruck.  The  agents  then  forced  entry  into  the  warehouse,  where  they  “observed  in \nplain  view  numerous  burlap-wrapped  bales  that  were  later  found  to  contain \nmarijuana.  They  left  without  disturbing  the  bales,  kept  the  warehouse  under \nsurveillance,”  and  re-entered  only  after  obtaining  a  warrant.  Id.  In  applying  for \nthe  warrant,  however,  the  agents  did  not  advise  the  court  of  their  prior  entry; \nthey  also  did  not  rely  on  their  observations  of  the  contents  of the  warehouse  in \norder  to  establish  probable  cause.  /d.  at  536.

Although  “[{k]nowledge  that  the \nMarijuana  was  in  the  warehouse  was  assuredly  acquired  at  the  time  of  the \nunlawful  entry  ..  .  it  was  also  acquired  at  the  time  of  entry  pursuant  to  the \nwarrant,  and  if  that  later  acquisition  was  not  the  result  of  the  earlier  entry  there  is \nno  reason  why  the  independent  source  doctrine  should  not  apply.”  Id.  at  541. \nEven  assuming  the  government  was  querying  databases  simultaneously \nwith  its  incidental  collection  activities,  according  to  the  government's  position  its \nagents  would  be  analogous  to  the  agents  in Murray.  Their  subjective \nunderstanding of  the  evidence might have  been  affected  by  the  fruits  of  an \nunreasonable  search,  and  had  they  relied  on  that  evidence  in  support  of  a \nwarrant  application  they  might  not  be  able  to  use  the  evidence  obtained  by \nexecuting  that  warrant.  But,  according  to  the  government,  if  the  information  they \nplaced  before  the  FISC,  and  that  court’s  subsequent  probable  cause \ndetermination,  rested  on  other  information,  that  “later  acquisition  was  not  the \nresult  of  the  earlier  [search]”  and  so  “there  is  no  reason  why  the  independent \nsource  doctrine  should  not  apply.”  Jd.  at  541. \n81\nSOR  PAPE  PRE  PR  a  POU  MIRA  OMe  OE  RE  A  OM  a \nSb  fads Une Pak SPEE SAe’S ONA S FEE   E8O   PBOSNE eveS eSSe rReYEn cbaatre t  3  YS :  MBeieble Geakse  SS TStP  TA   bd  DBat  enah nOEeS   oStUe   mbt s  BORie d  DRaSPc SeRA  G SePM)   Heen   Ti RAYs  3 \n“  \"  Aa  tae  a  PAE  oy  :  fogs  a  etka eat  ath AG  Sta  Ne  ls  Aart  wT  MAR  a  a  OTR  a Sa at \nWe  cannot  apply  the  independent  source  doctrine  on  the  record  currently \nbefore  us.  Had  this  case  gone  to  trial,  our  task  would  be  significantly  different. \nUnder  those  circumstances,  we  could  have  undertaken  to  trace,  as  the  Ninth \nCircuit  did  in Mohamud,  843  F.3d  at  438  &  n.21,  individual  pieces  of  evidence  that \nhad  actually been  presented  to  the jury  at that trial  in  order  to  assess  whether \nthose  pieces  of evidence  had been obtained  consistent  with  the  Fourth \nAmendment.  And  if  individual  pieces  of  evidence  needed  to be  suppressed,  the \nCourt  could  then  decide  whether  the  admission of  any  given  piece  of  evidence \nwas  harmless  when compared  to  all  the  legally  obtained  evidence  that  was \nultimately  presented  at  trial. \nBut  we  are  not  reviewing  the  acquisition  of evidence  used  at a  trial.  Rather, \nHasbajrami’s  appeal  reaches  us  following  a  conditional  plea  made  pursuant  to \nRule  11(a)(2)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of Criminal  Procedure.  Rule  11(a)(2)  provides \nthat: \nWith  the  consent  of  the  court  and  the  government,  a \ndefendant  may enter  a  conditional  plea  of  guilty  or  nolo \ncontendere,  reserving  in  writing  the  right to  have  an \nappellate  court  review  an  adverse  determination  of  a \nspecified  pretrial  motion.  A  defendant  who  prevails  on \nappeal  may  then  withdraw  the  plea. \n82\n<P P wo Tou—m—e   fSiVSe  PV ORE SPER EG Po  PPR Neosraenks aree steh   OFT PTEF   PWetis ss Lb  awP  aE Py a  aeo rfte oey   FDAN aa nee s >  ReaeU   aait   bTR ya ES,  PSRR S \nt  “  FA Ra a  ha haf  tet Sa SL DA  2  yogS  a  ad oh eet  Yate  5  tag Ne  Lara  wat  SO  ok tat \nAccording  to  the  Advisory  Committee  Notes  to  the  1983  Amendments, \nconditional  pleas  should  be  permitted  “only  when  the  decision  of  the  court  of \nappeals  will  dispose  of  the  case  either  by  allowing  the  plea  to  stand  or  by  such \naction  as  compelling  dismissal  of  the  indictment  or  suppressing  essential \nevidence.”  See  also  United  States  v.  Bundy,  392  F.3d  641,  647-48  (4th  Cir.  2004).  The \nclassic  example  of  a  case  in  which  that  standard  is  met  is  a  narcotics  case  in \nwhich  the  evidence  sought  to  be  suppressed  is  the  very  basis  of  the  charge.  The \nsuppression  of  the  evidence  would  end  the  case;  if the  evidence  is  admissible, \nguilt  is  assured;  if  not,  no  evidence  of  guilt  remains.  The  situation  is  more \nproblematic  and  complicated,  however,  where  the  suppression  of  some but not \nall  of  the  evidence  in  the  case  is  a  possible  outcome. \nOur  sister  circuits  have  applied  a  harmless  error  calculation  when \nevaluating  whether  an  opportunity  to  withdraw a  plea  is  a  necessary  remedy \nafter it  is  determined  on  appeal  that  the  challenged  district  court  ruling  was,  in \nwhole  or  in  part,  erroneous.  See,  e.g.,  United  States  v.  Lustig,  830  F.3d  1075,  1086 \n(9th  Cir.  2016);  United  States  v.  Rivera-Nevarez,  418  F.3d  1104  (10th  Cir.  2005) \n(affirming  conviction  on  harmless  error  where  conviction  was  upheld  on \n83\ngrounds  not  considered  by  district  court).”  Those  courts  have  applied  the \nharmless  error  rule  by  asking  “whether  the  erroneous  suppression  ruling  could \nhave  affected  [the  defendant's]  decision  to  plead  guilty.”  Lustig,  830  F.3d  at  1086. \nBut  the  record  here  is  murky.  It  is  clear  that  the  presence  or  absence  of \nSection  702  surveillance  affected  Hasbajrami’s  initial  decision  to  plead  guilty. \nIndeed,  it  was  because  the  district  court  was  convinced  that  Hasbajrami’s  initial \ndecision  to  plead  guilty  was  predicated  in  part  on  his  lawyers’  assurance  that  the \ngovernment  had  represented  that  there  was  no  warrantless  surveillance  in  his \ncase  that it granted  the  defense  motion  to  withdraw  Hasbajrami’s  first  guilty  plea \nwhen  those  representations  were  revealed  to  have  been  inaccurate.  App’x  at 39 \n(noting  that  Hasbajrami  “specifically  asked  [his  counsel]  about  whether \nwarrantless  wiretaps  had  played  a  role  in  his  case.  After  they  informed  him  that \nsuch  wiretaps  were  not  part  of  the  evidence,  he  was  more  willing  to  plead \nguilty.”).  Moreover,  Hasbajrami  moved  to  suppress  all  Section  702  material \n  \n2  The  Advisory  Committee  also  considered  Fed.  R.  Crim.  P.  11(h)’s  harmless \nerror  calculus  to  apply,  but  it  noted  that,  without  full  factual  development, \ninvocation  of  the  harmiess  error  rule  would  be  difficult.  The  Committee  noted, \nhowever,  that  “relatively  few  appellate  decisions  result  in  affirmance  upon \n[harmless  error].  Thus  it  will  only  rarely  be  true  that  the  conditional  plea  device \nwill  cause  an  appellate  court  to  consider  constitutional  questions  which  could \notherwise have  been  avoided  by invocation  of  the  doctrine  of  harmless  error.” \nFed.

What  is  unclear  is  just  how  much  Section \n702-acquired  information  would  remain,  after  further  fact-finding  at  the  district \ncourt.  It may  be  that,  after  a  full  evaluation  of  the  record  in  light  of  Hasbajrami’s \nmotion  to  suppress,  the  evidence  available  to  the  government  remains  very  much \nintact.  For  all  we  know,  any  queries  conducted  by  the  government  may have \nbeen  entirely  reasonable,  they  may  not  have  yielded  any  evidence  at  all,  and  any \nmaterial  that  was  uncovered  even  by  a  putatively  unconstitutional  query  may \nnot  have  affected  the  investigation  in  any  way. \nHowever  those  matters  would  be  decided  on  remand,  though,  we  cannot \npredict here  whether  any  such  queries  were  constitutionally  questionable,  or \nwhether  any  information  derived  from  such  queries  should  itself have  been \nsuppressed,  or  directly  or  indirectly  tainted  the  warrant  application.  And, \nwithout  being  able  to  fully  predict  or  decide  either  of  those  issues,  we  also  cannot \nadequately  predict  whether  a  potentially-altered  evidentiary  landscape  “could \nhave  affected  [Hasbajrami’s]  decision  to  plead  guilty.”  Lustig,  830  F.3d  at  1086; \nsee  also  United  States  v.  Leake,  95  F.3d  409,  420-421  (6th  Cir.  1996)  (noting  that  Fed. \nR.  Crim.  P.  11(a)(2)  addresses  the  situation  in  which  “the  defendant  is  fully \n85\nsuccessful  on  appeal,”  and  not  “the  effect  of a  partially  successful  appeal,”  but \nvacating judgment  because  “(defendant  was]  successful  in  excluding  what \nappears  to  be  the  most  damning  evidence  against  him.”)  (emphasis  in  original). \nTaking  these  considerations  into  account,  then,  we  are  left  with  a  posture \nsimilar  to  that  faced  by  this  Court in  United  States  v.  Wong  Ching  Hing,  867 F.2d \n754  (2d  Cir,  1989).  The  defendant  in  that  case  had  reserved  his  right  to  appeal  the \ndistrict  court’s  failure  to  suppress  roadside  statements  made  to  police  without \nMiranda  warnings,  as  well  as  subsequent  statements  made  at a  police  station.  Id. \nat  756.  This  Court,  like  the  district  court,  found  that  the  roadside  statements  were \nvoluntary  and  that  suppression  was  therefore  unnecessary  as  to  those.  Id.  But  the \ndefendant  had  made  two  separate  sets  of  statements  to  law  enforcement  once \ndetained  at  the police  station.  The  first  set  was  made  to  the  state  police,  and  it  did \nnot  add  anything  to  what  he  had  voluntarily  provided  at  the  initial  stop.  The \nsecond  set  of  statements,  however,  was  made  to  a  DEA  agent  and  “formed  the \nbasis  of  the  information  to  which  Wong  pled  guilty,”  which  charged  him  with \nmaking  a  false  statement.  Id. \nThe  Court  concluded  that  the  circumstances  “may  well  warrant  the \nconclusion  that  the  detention  was  not  valid  as  a  Terry  stop.”  Id.  at  758.  But  it  was \n86\nSseeve   FRYaIgSea    wess   PomM sO R EeNeS   ¢oS ty e Y  Swy AP foAeEs S   PTLN Se roy rseeaati itoed   nbhSa ,k o  of:   4e : eAebs ”  \n1  +  aha Sar Nat  r : \nunclear  what  effect  such  a  holding  would  have  on  Wong’s  legal  position,  because \nthe  record  was  not  clear  as  to  whether  the  conditional  guilty  plea  was \n“conditioned  upon  the  government's  being  successful  in  admitting  all  of the \nstatements  or  any  one  of them.”  Id.  at  758  (emphasis  added).  The  Court  therefore \nvacated  the  judgment  and  remanded  to  the  district  court  for  “further \nproceedings,”  noting  that  the  government  had  also  urged  affirmance  on  an \nalternative  ground  and  that  “the  parties  will  not  be  precluded  from  asserting \nnew  arguments”  on  remand.  Id. \nWe  therefore  follow  a  similar  course  of  action  here.  Because  the  district \ncourt was  not  even  aware  whether  such  querying  had  occurred,  and  because \neven  we  have  not  been  advised  as  to  what  was  done,  for  what  reasons,  and  with \nwhat  results,  we  remand  to  the  district  court  to  determine  the  facts,  consistent \nwith  the  considerations  stated  above,  and  to  decide  in  the  first  instance,  based  on \nits  factual  findings,  whether  there was  a  constitutional  violation  in  this  particular \ncase,  and  what  (if  any)  evidence  would  need  to  be  suppressed  if  there  was \nindeed  a  violation.  Similarly,  we  leave  it  to  the  district  court  to  determine,  in  the \nfirst  instance,  whether  any  exceptions  to  the  exclusionary  rule,  such  as  a  good \n87\nfaith  exception,  might  apply  in  this  case.”  Finally,  we  leave  it  to  the  district  court \nto  determine,  if  any  evidence  should  have  been  suppressed,  whether  the  failure \nto  suppress  that evidence  was  harmless,  and  if  it was  not  what remedy is \nappropriate. \nOn  remand,  the  district court  should  undertake  whatever proceedings  are \nnecessary,  consistent  with  the  considerations  stated  above.  To  the  extent  that  any \ndecisions  must  be  made  about  what  information  is  to  be  presented  to \nappropriately-cleared  defense  counsel,  such  decisions  too  are  best  left  to  the \ndistrict  court  after  it becomes  clear  what  the  inquiry  about  querying  will \ninvolve.  Cf,  Abu-Jihaad,  630  F.3d  at  129  (noting  that,  under  FISA,  disclosure  is \n  \n23 The  government  has  argued  before  this  Court  that  the  good  faith  exception \nwould  apply.  Because  of  the  incomplete  record  here,  we  take  no  position  as  to \nwhether  the  exception  applies. \n+4  Hasbajrami argues  on  appeal  that  his  due  process  rights  would  be  violated  if \nhe  is  not provided  with  an  unredacted  or  unmodified  version  of  the  district \ncourt’s  order.  He  concedes,  however,  that  the  argument  would  be  rendered  moot \nif  this  Court  reverses  on  either  constitutional  or  statutory  grounds.  After \nreviewing  the  minor  redactions,  we  conclude  that  the limited  information \nredacted  from  the  district  court’s  opinion  could  not have  substantially  affected \nHasbajrami‘s  due  process  rights  in  this  appeal.  In  any  event,  we  undertook  de \nnovo  review  and  we  are  satisfied  that  the  limited  redactions  in  the  portions  of this \nopinion  relating  to  the  district court’s  rulings  do  not  require  disclosure  to  the \ndefense  at  this  time.  We  therefore  deny  Hasbajrami’s  request  to  unseal or  to \ndisclose  to  the  defense  team  the  redacted  portions  of  the  district  court  opinion. \nAs  addressed  above,  however,  the  district  court  remains  free  to  consider,  in  the \n88\nCase  1:11-cr-00623-DL]|  Document  177  Filed  12/19/19  Page  89  of  89  PagelD  #:  1898 \nexception  and  ex parte,  in  camera  review  is  the  rule,  and  that  the  review  of \nmaterials  that  are  “relatively  straightforward  and  not  complex”  may  not \nnecessarily  require  adversarial  testing). \nCONCLUSION \nBased  on  the  foregoing  considerations,  we  REMAND  to  the  district  court \nfor  further  proceedings  consistent  with  this  opinion. \nA  True  Copy \n  \nfirst  instance,  what  if  any  classified  material,  including  the  government’s  Rule \n28(j)  letter  and  the  redacted  portions  of  this  opinion  relating  to  querying,  should \nbe  provided  to  properly-cleared  defense  counsel  on  remand,  consistent  with  the \nrequirements  of  CIPA  and  FISA.  We  therefore  DENY  Hasbajrami’s  February  8, \n2019  motion  for  disclosure  of  the  government's  Rule  28(j)  letter,  without \n  \nprejudice  to  renewal  before  the  district  court  on  remand. \n89\n\n############# Old Text on 20240820 ###############\n15-2684C(Las)e 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 177   Filed 12/19/19   Page 1 of 89 PageID #: 1810\nUnited States of America v.

In other words, review is difficult because we must \nconsider those individual \"separate decisions\" within the context of the program \nas a whole.16 \nIn this case, it is undisputed that the government possessed ample \nevidence obtained from surveillance authorized by a FISA warrant to convict \nHasbajrami. The evidence that formed the basis for that warrant however, was \nobtained as a result of warrantless Section 702 surveillance of non-United States \npersons located abroad. Thus, the primary issue, affecting the bulk of the \nevidence against Hasbajrami, is whether the incidental collection of the \ncommunications of United' States persons, without a warrant, violates the Fourth \nAmendment. We conclude, as did the district court, that such collection is lawful. \nBut that is not the only action involving Section 702 surveillance at issue here. \n16 When reviewing a district court's denial of a motion to suppress evidence, we \nreview the court's legal determinations de novo and its factual findings for clear \nerror.

First, they argue that surveillance of individuals in the United \nStates is per se unreasonable if it is conducted without a warrant. They also focus \non the specific attributes of warrants - the particularity requirement, the need \nfor a neutral judicial forum and a finding of probable cause - and argue that \nSection 702,. the targeting and minimization procedures, and FISC oversight do \nnot provide a substitute procedure sufficient to satisfy the Fourth Amendment. \nAccording to Hasbajrami, the broad scope of Section 702's surveillance and the \ngovernment's failure to seek a warrant or its equivalent render the program \nunconstitutional as applied to him and therefore requires the suppression of \nevidence acquired under the program. \nWe disagree. In addressing the issues before us, we adopt an approach \nsimilar to that employed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit in United States v. Mohamud, 843 F.3d 420 (9th Cir. 2016). We must first \ndecide whether a warrant is required for the government's incidental collection \nof the communications of United States persons. We conclude that a warrant is \nnot required for such collection.

The Fourth Amendment generally is \nnot violated when law enforcement officers, having lawfully undertaken \nelectronic surveillance, whether under the authority of a warrant or an exception \nto the warrant requirement, discover and seize either evidence of criminal \nactivity that they would not have had probable cause to search for in the first \nplace, or the relevant conversations of an individual they did not anticipate or \nname in a warrant application.

(internal citation omitted). \nCombining these two Fourth Amendment principles, the government may \nlawfully collect, without a warrant and pursuant to Section 702, the e-mails of \nforeign individuals located abroad who reasonably appear to constitute a \npotential threat to the United States and, once it is lawfully collecting those e \nmails, it does not need to seek a warrant, supported by probable cause, to \ncontinue to collect e-mails between that person and other individuals once it is \nlearned that some of those individuals are United States citizens or lawful \npermanent residents, or are located in the United States.

Supp. 3d 724, 748-49 (N.D. \nOhio 2018) (applying Verdugo-Urquidez and rejecting Fourth Amendment \nchallenge to Section 702 surveillance where, despite marriage to United States \ncitizen, defendant lived abroad at time of offense); United States v.

That is the case even if the government \nwould have needed, but did not have, a warrant or probable cause had it sought \nto collect the e-mails of the American third party in the first instance. Cf. In re \nCertified Question, 858 F.3d at 604 (framing constitutional issue as whether \nincidental content collection rendered primary dialing information collection \nunreasonable, not whether warrant would have been required for content \ncollection in its own right). \nObjecting to this conclusion, Hasbajrami and amici advance several \narguments seeking to apply the warrant requirement to Hasbajrami's case. Each \nis unavailing. \nFirst, they argue that Verdugo-Urquidez does not control the outcome here \nbecause Section 702 collection occurs in the United States. Practically speaking, \nSection 702 surveillance could occur only within the United States, as the agencies \ncan compel only ISPs located in the United States to provide e-mails. \nBut Fourth Amendment doctrine relating to wire or electronic \ncommunication does not focus on the location where the communication takes \nplace.

While we have concerns, expressed below, about the potential scope of \nSection 702 surveillance, those concerns are less applicable where, as here, \ncollection and review are occurring nearly contemporaneously and that \ncollection is ancillary to lawful surveillance of a permitted target. In the nahlre of \nlaw enforcement, there is always a possibility that the collection of evidence \nagainst a person who there is already probable cause to believe is involved in \ncriminal activity or who is otherwise legitimately subject to surveillance will also \ndevelop information about others not previously reasonably suspected of \nwrongdoing. There is no contention here that the Section 702 surveillance was \nundertaken as a pretext to collect the communications of Hasbajrami, or of any \nother identified United States person or person located in the United States. That \nthe overall practice of surveilling foreigners abroad of interest to the legitimate \npurpose of gathering foreign intelligence information may predictably lead to the \ninterception of communications with United States persons no more invalidates \nthat practice, or requires the government to cease its surveillance of the target \nuntil a warrant is obtained, than the general foreseeability of intercepting \ncommunications with previously unknown co~conspirators undermines the \ninadvertent overhear doctrine in ordinary domestic criminal wiretapping. \n57 \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 177   Filed 12/19/19   Page 58 of 89 PageID #: 1867\nFinally, Hasbajrami and amid seek to distinguish the 11incidental overhear\" \nline of cases, noting that in those cases there was already an initial warrant \nsupported by probable cause. They agree, however, that \"the incidental overhear \ncases simply stand for the proposition that the government need not obtain \nmultiple warrants to intercept protected communications.\" Brief of Amici Curiae \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Frontier Foundation at 15, United \nStates v. Hasbajrami, No. 15-2684 (2d Cir. Oct. 23, 2017} (emphasis in original). \nThat is exactly the point here: once that initial surveillance is rendered lawful by \na warrant, a FISC order, or some other exception to the warrant requirement, an \nadditional warrant is not necessary in order to collect the calls or e-mails of third \nparties.  As the district court recognized, once the surveillance was \"lawful in the \nfirst place -whether it is the domestic surveillance of U.S. persons pursuant to a \nwarrant or the warrantless surveillance of non-U.S. persons who are abroad -\nthe incidental interception of non-targeted U.S. persons' communications with \nthe targeted persons is also lawful.\" Suppression Decision, 2016 WL 1029500 at \"\"9. \nThe reason why the initial surveillance was lawful does not matter to this \nconclusion. \n58 \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 177   Filed 12/19/19   Page 59 of 89 PageID #: 1868\nAcocrdinthgeli yn,c idceoneltclatiloo nfU  nitSetda pteerss oen-sm'a ils \ndurilnagw ffuolr einitgenl nlcisegu erveiolffl oarnecielgn oecrasat berdo iansdo  t \npesre u nreasonbaebclaethu esc eo lleicdsto inoweni  thaow uatr rant. \nB.

Lustig, 830 F.3d at 1086. \nBut the record here is murky. It is clear that the presence or absence of \nSection 702 surveillance affected Hasbajrami' s initial decision to plead guilty. \nIndeed, it was because the district court was convinced that Hasbajrami's initial \ndecision to plead guilty was predicated in part on his lawyers' assurance that the \ngovernment had represented that there was no warrantless surveillance in his \ncase that it granted the defense motion to withdraw Hasbajrami's first guilty plea \nwhen those representations were revealed to have been inaccurate. App'x at 39 \n(noting that Hasbajrami \"specifically asked [his counsel] about whether \nwarrantless wiretaps had played a role in his case. After they informed him that \nsuch wiretaps were not part of the evidence, he was more willing to plead \nguilty.\"). Moreover, Hasbajrami moved to suppress all Section 702 material \n22 The Advisory Committee also considered Fed. R. Crim. P. ll(h)'s harmless \nerror calculus to apply, but it noted that, without full factual development, \ninvocation of the harmless error rule would be difficult. The Committee noted, \nhowever, that \"relatively few appellate decisions result in affirmance upon \n[harmless error]. Thus it will only rarely be true that the conditional plea device \nwill cause an appellate court to consider constitutional questions which could \notherwise have been avoided by invocation of the doctrine of harmless error.\" \nFed. R. Crim. P. 11, advisory committee's notes to 1983 amendments. \n84 \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 177   Filed 12/19/19   Page 85 of 89 PageID #: 1894\ncollbeytc htgeedo  vernmienuncdtli,mn agt

IRIZARRY, Chief United States District Judge: \n  On April 17, 2017, Defendant Agron Hasbajrami (“Defendant”) filed a letter seeking \nreconsideration of this Court’s April 6, 2017 Memorandum and Order (“M & O”) denying \nDefendant’s motion to grant his counsel access to the redacted portions of the Honorable John \nGleeson’s  February  18,  2016  decision  denying  Defendant’s  motion  to  suppress  intercepted \nelectronic communications.  (See Defendant’s Letter for Reconsideration (“Def. Ltr.”), Dkt. Entry \nNo. 172.)  Per the Court’s instruction, the government responded on May 1, 2017.  (See Response \nto Defendant’s Letter (“Gov. Resp.”), Dkt. Entry No. 173.)   \n“The standard for granting [a motion for reconsideration] is strict, and reconsideration will \ngenerally be denied unless the moving party can point to controlling decisions or data that the court \noverlooked—matters, in other words, that might reasonably be expected to alter the conclusion \nreached by the court.”  Shrader v. CSX Transp., Inc., 70 F.3d 255, 257 (2d Cir. 1995) (internal \ncitations omitted).  Typical grounds for reconsideration include “‘an intervening change of \ncontrolling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent \nmanifest injustice.’”  Kolel Beth Yechiel Mechil of Tartikov, Inc. v. YLL Irrevocable Tr., 729 F.3d \n99, 104 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting Virgin Atl. Airways, Ltd. v. Nat'l Mediation Bd., 956 F.2d 1245, \n1255 (2d Cir.1992)).  “[A] motion for reconsideration is not an opportunity for litigants to reargue \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 174   Filed 08/22/17   Page 2 of 3 PageID #: 1805\ntheir previous positions or present new or alternative theories that they failed to set forth in \nconnection with the underlying motion.”  Callari v. Blackman Plumbing Supply, Inc., 988 F. \nSupp.2d 261, 287 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (internal citations omitted).  \n  Defendant has not met the standard for granting a motion for reconsideration.  Defendant \nmoves for reconsideration under the disingenuous guise of seeking “clarification” as to the nature \nof the redacted information considered by Judge Gleeson.  Defendant merely restates his earlier \narguments rejected by both Judge Gleeson and this Court, without citation of any new authority or \nany facts or case law the Court did not consider.  This Court already has considered the precise \nquestions presented in Defendant’s Letter, and determined that neither the Classified Information \nProcedures Act (“CIPA”) nor the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”) compels or \nallows disclosure of an unredacted copy of Judge Gleeson’s opinion.   \n  Under FISA, this Court determined that Defendant’s counsel was not entitled to an \nunredacted copy of Judge Gleeson’s opinion “because releasing it would reveal classified foreign \nintelligence information and circumvent FISA by undermining the purpose of section 1806(f).” \n(M & O at 6.)  Further, the Court found that “FISA does not mandate disclosure in order to help \ndefendants make an appeal.”  (Id. at 7.)  \nThis Court held that “CIPA does not compel or regulate the discovery of classified \ninformation contained in a court’s written opinion.”  (Id. at 11.)  The Court noted that, “[b]ecause \nJudge Gleeson conducted his review of the classified materials by relying on FISA, the Court holds \nthat FISA determines whether or not Defendant’s attorneys have a ‘need-to-know’ the contents of \nthe Unredacted Opinion.”  (Id. at 12).  This Court concluded that, “[a]pplying FISA, defense \ncounsel do not have a ‘need-to-know’ the contents of the Unredacted Opinion” and found that \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-DLI   Document 174   Filed 08/22/17   Page 3 of 3 PageID #: 1806\n“[t]he redacted content neither facilitates countering the government’s case nor bolsters a defense.”  \n(Id. at 13.)  \n  Accordingly, Defendant’s letter seeking reconsideration is denied. \n \nSO ORDERED.   \n \nDated: Brooklyn, New York \nAugust 22, 2017 \n                               /s/ \n              DORA L.

Mississippi, Delta Division. \nJuly 2, 1970. \nSupplemental Opinion February 12, 1971. \n175*175 Melvyn R. Leventhal, of Anderson, Banks, Nichols & Leventhal, Jackson, \nMiss., for plaintiffs. \nWilliam H. Maynard, of Maynard, Fitzgerald, Maynard & Bradley, Clarksdale, Miss., \nfor defendants. \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nORMA R. SMITH, District Judge. \nThis action is before the Court for adoption of a plan for the operation of the schools \nof defendant school district, Coahoma County School District, to be effective with the \nopening of school for the school year 1970-71. \nPursuant to previous order of the Court, two plans have been submitted, and are \nnow on file in this action. A plan has been submitted by Dr. Forrest W. Murphy, \nSpecial Master appointed by the Court. (Murphy Plan) The plaintiffs and defendants \nhave filed objections to this plan. A plan has been submitted by the Division of Equal \nEducational Opportunities, 176*176 United States Office of Education. (HEW plan) \nThe parties object to this plan. \nThe Court must evaluate each of these in light of existing legal principles. \nThere are several generally accepted rules of law applicable to the case sub judice. \nThe defendant Coahoma County School District (School Board) has the obligation to \nterminate its dual system of schools at once and to operate now and hereafter only a \nunitary system within which no person is to be effectively excluded from any school \nbecause of race or color.

If \nthe plan upon implementation proves to be unworkable or to have defects herein, the \nburden is upon the School Board to point this out to the Court and seek modification. \nThe tenor of the law in converting to a unitary system is to shift from a status of \nlitigation to one of unitary operation pending litigation. Alexander v. Holmes, County \nBd. of Ed., supra, United States of America by Mitchell v. Board of Education of \nBaldwin County, Georgia et al., 5 Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 848. \nThe district relies upon the facilities of the Coahoma County Agricultural High School \n(Aggie High) which is operated by the Coahoma Junior College (Junior College), to \nhouse its black student population. This school was established in 1924 as a black \nschool under Mississippi Law[1] by the County School Board at that time. The policy \nto operate as an all black school was discarded 177*177 in 1968, when the Junior \nCollege and the School Board entered into a contract opening the school to all \nraces.[2] This policy, however, has not been fruitful, as no white child has ever \nattended Aggie High. \nOn June 8, 1949, the Board of Trustees of Aggie High ordered the thirteenth year of \nwork added to the school for the 1949-50 school year, and the fourteenth year of \nwork for the 1950-51 session. Thus, a Junior College was established to be operated \nin conjunction with Aggie High. The name of the school was changed to Coahoma \nJunior College and Agricultural High School. \nThe Mississippi Legislature in 1950[3] authorized the establishment of junior colleges \nand validated all existing junior colleges.[4] Thus, the Junior College became a Junior \nCollege under Mississippi Law, with Aggie High as an adjunct thereto. The Junior \nCollege, like Aggie High, is an all black school. \n\nSince the creation of the Junior College, Aggie High has been under the control of \nthe Junior College. The character of the school has not changed. It is now, as it \nalways has been, an all black school serving black children of Coahoma County. \nAggie High is supported, in part, from taxes assessed on and collected from all \nproperty situated in Coahoma County, including that situated within the Clarksdale \nMunicipal Separate School District. Any child in the Municipal Separate School \nDistrict may attend Aggie High. A number of the black children residing in the \nMunicipal Separate School District have in the past attended and now attend Aggie \nHigh. \nIt is clear that Aggie High is under the control of and is operated by the Junior \nCollege. The School Board does not control nor have the right to control Aggie High. \nThe parties agree that such is the status of Aggie High. The Court agrees. \nThe School Board and the Board of Trustees of the Junior College, however, can \ncontract with reference to the attendance at Aggie High of high school students \nresiding in the defendant school district. In fact such a contract is now in existence.[5] \nIn light of the principles of law outlined above, and the foregoing statement of the \nstatus of Aggie High, existing under applicable statutes of the State of Mississippi, \nthe Court must consider the plans for the operation of the schools of the district as \nsubmitted to the court. \nBefore entering upon a discussion of the plans available to the Court, it is well to \nstate that the central point of contention concerns the Junior and Senior High \nSchools of the district. \nThe controversy with regard to the elementary grades, i. e., 1 through 6, appears to \nhave been settled. At least there is no controversy at the present time in regard \nthereto. \nThis opinion, therefore, will deal principally with the assignment of students in grades \n7 through 12 to the schools in the district. \nTo set the stage for this discussion there should be kept in mind the background with \nreference to the assignment of students in grades 7 through 12 to schools within the \ndistrict. For the scholastic year 1968-69 all white children in the district, in grades 7 \nthrough 12, attended Coahoma County Junior-Senior High School. There were 611 \nwhite students and 4 black students attending this school for the year mentioned. \nAll 178*178 black students in grades 7 and 8 attended neighborhood schools for that \nscholastic year. All black students in grades 9 through 12 (1,011 in number) \nattended Aggie High. \nThe Court ordered the district to provide for the assignment of black students in \ngrades 9 through 12 to the Coahoma County High School for the scholastic year \n1969-70 in such numbers as to reach a 20% ratio in the student body. Thereafter, \nthe Court provided that black students in grades 7 and 8 should be transferred from \n\nneighborhood schools to the Coahoma County Junior High School to the extent \nnecessary to bring the student body for those grades to a fifty-fifty level. \nIn carrying out the orders of the Court for the 1969-70 school year, 71 black students \nattended grades 7 through 12 at Coahoma County Junior-Senior High School. The \nstudent body was composed of 488 white children and 71 black children for a total of \n559 students. For the scholastic year 1969-70 all other black students in grades 9 \nthrough 12 attended Aggie High. \nThe student population of the district in grades 9 through 12 is 1,376, composed of \n341 white children and 1,035 black children. To accommodate these children the \ndefendant district has one attendance center to offer, i. e., Coahoma County Junior-\nSenior High School. The capacity of this school is said by the Board to be 700 \nstudents. Dr. Murphy and HEW show the capacity to be 900 students. The difference \nseems to stem from the fact that the Board considered some of the classrooms in \nthe school as being used for special purpose classes and not available for regular \nclassrooms. For the purpose of the Court's decision the capacity as represented by \nthe Board will be accepted. \nThere are 155 students in grades 7 and 8 presently attending the Coahoma County \nJunior High School. When considering the room available for high school students in \ngrades 9 through 12, the students in grades 7 and 8 will not be considered. \nThe Board suggests to the Court that a plan be adopted which will provide that all \nwhite students in grade 7 through 12 within the district be assigned to the Coahoma \nCounty Junior-Senior High School Attendance Center. The latest available school \nrecords show that there are within the district 341 white students in grades 9 through \n12, and 147 white students in grades 7 and 8. In order to carry out the Board's \nsuggestion these students, aggregating 488, would be assigned to the Coahoma \nCounty Junior-Senior High School Attendance Center. The Board would then assign \nto the center 122 black students distributed through grades 7 through 12. After this \nhad been accomplished, the student body at the Attendance Center would be \ncomposed of 80% white and 20% black children. The Board asserts that if the \npercentage of black students in the school is more than 20% the white children will \nleave the school, resulting in all black Junior-Senior High School. The effect of such \na plan would be that 122 black students out of a total of 1922 in the grades \nmentioned would receive an integrated education.[6] \n179*179 All black students in the district in grades 9 through 12, other than those \nassigned to Coahoma County Junior-Senior High School Attendance Center, would \nattend Aggie High. All those black students in grades 7 and 8, other than those \nassigned to Coahoma County Junior-Senior High School, would attend \nneighborhood schools. \nThe Board does not make available to the Court the means by which the Board \nwould select the 122 black students to attend the center aforesaid out of the 1,922 \nblack students in the district. Quotas in the past have been acquired in this \nattendance center by freedom-of-choice or other means devised by the Board. \n\nA cursory examination of this plan reveals clearly that if the plan is adopted and \ncarried into effect, the de jure dual system of schools which has been and is now \nestablished in the defendant district will not be eliminated and a unitary system will \nnot be accomplished. The directive of Alexander v. Holmes, County Bd. of Ed., \nsupra, that the dual system be eliminated and a unitary system forthwith established, \nwould not be accomplished. \nMURPHY PLAN \nThe Murphy plan is based upon the assumption that the Coahoma County Junior-\nSenior High School will accommodate 900 students. Dr. Murphy recommended \nassignment of students in grades 7 through 12 to this school on an equal basis, i. e., \n450 white students and 450 black students. \nConsidering this recommendation in the light of a 700 student capacity, the number \nto be assigned to the attendance center would be 350 white students and 350 black \nstudents. \nSuch a program would leave unassigned 138 white students and 1572 black \nstudents. The black and white students who are not assigned to the Coahoma \nCounty Junior-Senior High School Attendance Center would be assigned to the \nneighborhood schools of the district and to Aggie High. Those students in grades 7 \nand 8 would be assigned to the neighborhood schools, and those in grades 9 \nthrough 12 would attend Aggie High. \nDr. Murphy does not recommend a method by which students may be assigned to \nthe Coahoma County Junior-Senior High School Attendance Center. This matter \nwould be left to the discretion of the Board or to the direction of the Court. \nThe Court is of the opinion that the Murphy plan, while developing one school in the \ndistrict which would meet the criteria of \"just a school\", would leave a dual system of \nschools. There would not be a unitary system of schools for the district under the \nMurphy Plan. \nHEW PLAN \nThe HEW Plan provides for the assignment of all students residing in the district in \ngrades 10 through 12 to the Coahoma County Junior-Senior High School \nAttendance Center. HEW projects the enrollment at this center as 923 students. It is \nrecommended that a portable classroom be added to this center in order to take care \nof the excess school population. HEW's proposal is bottomed on a capacity for the \ncenter of 900 students. As has been hereinbefore noted, the School Board takes the \nposition that the capacity of this center is 700 rather than 900 students. \nThe HEW Plan provides for the assignment of all students residing within the district \nin grades 8 and 9 to Aggie High. The projected enrollment shown by the plan is \n1,051 students. The plan shows that this attendance center has the capacity of 972 \n\nstudents. It is envisioned, however, that the Sandy Bayou Attendance Center, which \nis situated adjacent to the Aggie High Campus, would be used in conjunction with \nAggie High in order to accommodate the student population in these grades. The \nplan provides that all students residing in the district attending grade 7 be assigned \nto neighborhood schools. Defendants 180*180object to HEW's plan and bottom their \nobjection upon the contention that Aggie High, being under the jurisdiction of the \nJunior College, is not authorized by statute to teach anything but high school grades, \ni. e., 9 through 12. Defendants contend that this part of HEW's plan is impermissible. \nThe Court should, if possible, adopt a plan for the operation of the schools within the \nschool district which will not conflict with the statutory law of the state. The Junior \nCollege has always operated Aggie High and is not authorized to operate anything \nbut a high school. \nPlaintiffs suggest the zoning of the two high schools in the district and the \nassignment of students in grades 1 through 8 to neighborhood schools. The black \nchildren in the district in grades 1 through 8 have always attended neighborhood \nschools. White children in grades 1 through 6 have always attended neighborhood \nschools, while those in grades 7 through 12 have attended the Coahoma County \nJunior-High School Attendance Center. The defendant School District can \naccommodate only 700 high school students at the Coahoma County Junior-Senior \nHigh School Attendance Center. The latest available figures reflect that there are \nresiding within the district 1376 students in the high school grades. If the capacity of \nthe Coahoma County Junior-Senior High School Attendance Center is utilized there \nwill be 676 students in the high school grades who will not have available facilities \nunless they attend Aggie High. \nIt has been noted above that defendant School District and the Junior College Board \nof Trustees have presently in force a contract for the attendance at Aggie High of \nhigh school students residing within defendant district. The Court can see no \nlegitimate objection to the zoning of the district for the assignment of students in the \nhigh school grades. \nThe Court is cognizant of the opinion held by defendant School Board that such a \nplan for the School District will have the effect of causing the white students to \nabandon the schools. The Court cannot envision a plan, the implementation of which \nwill eliminate the dual system of schools in the district which does not provide for the \nassignment of high school students on some type of a zoning plan to the two \navailable high school attendance centers. \nThe Court has not discussed other features of the plan which it is necessary for \ndefendant school board to adopt in order to eliminate the dual system of schools. \nThe Fifth Circuit has indicated that the District Courts should require school districts \nto comply with the provisions of Singleton.[7] The provisions of Singleton will be \nincorporated in the order of the Court. \nAn appropriate order will be entered pursuant to this opinion. \n\nSUPPLEMENTAL OPINION \nThe plaintiffs in this action have moved the court for supplemental relief. The court \nhas received evidence and argument of counsel on the motion and now makes its \nfindings of fact and conclusions of law which will control the court's decision on the \nmotion. \nIn the court's order of August 18, 1970, defendant Coahoma County School District \nwas authorized for the school year 1970-71 to permit the transfer of students \nbetween the two secondary schools operated for the benefit of high school students \nresiding in the district under the conditions and circumstances set forth in the order. \nBasically transfers were authorized so that students residing in one geographic zone \nof the district could transfer to the school serving the other zone to pursue a course \nof study not available in the school serving the zone of the residence of the student. \n181*181 The court directed that a study be made of the curriculum of the two \nsecondary schools and the feasibility of changes being made to eliminate the \ndisparity existing in the courses of study offered at the schools. \nThe defendant school districts caused the study mentioned in the preceding \nparagraph to be made, and they concluded that, at the present time, there existed no \nnecessity for changing the curriculum at either school. The defendant boards \npresented a written report to the court on December 7, 1970, expressing the \nconclusion reached by them. \nDefendant Board of Education of Coahoma County, on September 23, 1970, filed a \nwritten report in this action, setting forth in detail the transfers which had been \ngranted pursuant to the transfer provisions of the court's order. The report reflects \nthat sixty-six transfers were granted — twenty-six for students residing in the zone \nserved by Aggie High to transfer to Coahoma County High School, and forty for \nstudents residing in the zone served by Coahoma County High School to transfer to \nAggie High. \nPlaintiffs filed a motion for supplemental relief on December 28, 1970, and a hearing \nwas held on the motion on January 25, 1971. Evidence received at the hearing \nreflects that twenty-seven students transferred out of the Aggie High zone to the \nzone served by the Coahoma County High School. Twenty-two of these students \nwere white students and five were black students. The evidence reflects that thirty-\nnine students residing in the zone served by the Coahoma County High School \ntransferred to Aggie High.[1] \nDefendant Board of Education of Coahoma County, in its report filed with the court \non October 16, 1970, shows that 593 students are in attendance at Coahoma \nCounty High School, of which 418 are black students and 175 are white students. \nThe school's faculty of thirty-two full time teachers consists of four black teachers \nand twenty-eight white teachers. The percentages in faculty assignment are 88% \nwhite and 12% black. \n\nAt the hearing on the motion the evidence reflects that for the 1970-71 school year \nthe student body at Aggie High is composed of 748 students, only one of which is a \nwhite student. The faculty is composed of forty-seven black teachers and one white \nteacher. The evidence further reflects that the student body at Coahoma County \nHigh, at this time, is composed of 377 black students and 152 white students for a \ntotal of 529 students. The faculty composition is shown to be the same as reflected \nby the report filed with the court. \nThe statistical information furnished by the defendant school boards compels the \nconclusion that the transfer provision authorized by the court in its order of August \n18, 1970 has impeded rather than encouraged the integration of the two secondary \nschools serving high school students residing in the Coahoma County School \nDistrict. The figures hereinbefore mentioned speak for themselves. Figures speak \nand when they do courts listen.[2] \nIt is, therefore, the duty of the court to withdraw the transfer provision of its previous \norder, effective at the close of the current school year.[3] \nPlaintiffs suggest that the court enter a transfer provision authorizing 182*182 the \ntransfer of any black student assigned to the Coahoma Agricultural High School to \nthe Coahoma County High School; and any white student assigned to the Coahoma \nCounty High School to the Coahoma Agricultural High School. Such a transfer \nprovision does not appear to the court to be appropriate for the defendant school \ndistrict. \nThe Coahoma County School District is unique and does not lend itself to a regular \npattern of school desegregation plans. The district has operated a dual system of \nsecondary schools since the establishment of the agricultural high school by the \ncounty in 1924.[4] The facilities of the county school district are not and have never \nbeen adequate to provide educational opportunities for all secondary students \nresiding within the district. Facilities for the white student population have been \nprovided, and the black students have been sent to Aggie High. \nBlack students in small numbers have attended the county high school in prior years. \nWith the zoning of the district this year the county high school is predominately \nblack, and Aggie High remains virtually all black. \nThere has been some desegregation of the faculty at the county high school (28 \nwhite and 4 blacks), but virtually none at Aggie High (47 blacks and 1 white). The \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has consistently held that faculty desegregation \nis one of the prerequisites of a unitary school system. Davis v. Board of School \nCommissioners of Mobile County, 430 F.2d 883 (5 Cir. 1970). Without faculty \ndesegregation the system continues to be a dual system of schools. It must be \nconceded that faculty desegregation encourages and paves the way for student \ndesegregation. Faculty desegregation is therefore an essential step in the \ndesegregation of any school district. \n\nThe record in this action reflects that the defendant Coahoma County School District, \nthrough its board of trustees (County Board), selects and employs the faculty and \nstaff at Coahoma County High School and that the Board of Trustees of Coahoma \nJunior College (Junior College Board) selects and employs the faculty and staff at \nAggie High. \nThe July 2, 1970 order of the court provided for the desegregation of the faculty and \nstaff of defendant Coahoma County School District according to the faculty and staff \ndesegregation standard enunciated in Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate \nSchool District, 419 F.2d 1211 (5 Cir. 1970). The faculty and staff of Aggie High were \nnot covered by this portion of the order since such faculty and staff were not a faculty \nand staff of defendant Coahoma County School District. The court, in dealing with \nthe faculty and staff of Aggie High, provided in its order that defendant Junior \nCollege Board, in selecting the 183*183 faculty for Aggie High, should abide by the \nprinciples enunciated in Singleton, supra, so far as practical to do so. \nThe evidence shows that the Junior College Board has endeavored to desegregate \nits faculty and staff by a voluntary approach. The figures show, however, that the \nendeavor of the board has not been successful. It is, therefore, apparent that the \ncourt must deal with the problem in a manner different from that which has been \nutilized in the past. \nThe County Board contends that it does not have a voice in the selection of the \nfaculty and staff of Aggie High. The Junior College Board contends that it does not \nhave a voice in the selection of the faculty and staff of Coahoma County High \nSchool. Thus, each board contends that it is without legal authority or right to require \nmembers of its faculty or staff to accept assignments to a school in a different \ndistrict, as a condition of continued employment. Hence, the boards say the only way \nfaculty and staff desegregation can be accomplished is by the employment by each \nboard of a sufficient number of faculty and staff members of each race, who are \nwilling to work in a desegregated situation. It is apparent, however, that this \napproach will not solve the problem. \nThe Coahoma County School District is legally obligated to provide educational \nopportunities to all children of every race in the elementary and secondary grades \nresiding within its district. The obligation of the district is to furnish these \nopportunities without constitutional infirmities. Local conditions, separate legal \nentities, state laws and statutes cannot frustrate the implementation of \nconstitutionally protected rights. United States v. Indianola Municipal Separate \nSchool District, 410 F.2d 626, 630-631 (5 Cir. 1969). The remedial power of the \nfederal courts under the Fourteenth Amendment is not limited by state law. Haney v. \nCounty Board of Education of Sevier County, 429 F.2d 364, 368 (8 Cir. 1970). The \ncourt is dealing with boards which have been created pursuant to state law and owe \ntheir existence to state statutes. In the context of this action the boards deal with the \nsame subject matter — students residing within the defendant school district who \nattend secondary grades. The defendant school district must, therefore, rely upon \nAggie High to furnish the necessary additional facilities. \n\nWhen faced with the problem presented in this action the court can only respond by \nrequiring the County Board and Junior College Board to provide for the exchange of \nthe faculty and staff personnel in Coahoma County High School and the Agricultural \nHigh School to the extent necessary to implement the Singleton standard in both \nschools. To give effect to the standard the two schools will necessarily have to be \nconsidered as schools of defendant school district. \nAn appropriate order is being entered by the court. \n[1] Section 6454, Mississippi Code, 1942, Annotated, Recompiled. This statute was enacted by the \nMississippi Legislature in 1924, Chapter 283, Laws of Mississippi, 1924, and provides: \n\"§ 6454. County school board to establish county agricultural high schools. — The county school board in \neach county in the state is hereby authorized and empowered to establish not more than two agricultural \nhigh schools in the county, and determine their location, one for the white youths exclusively and the other \nfor colored youths exclusively, in which instruction shall be given in high school branches, theoretical and \npractical agriculture, domestic science, and in such other branches as the board may hereinafter provide for, \nand made a part of the curriculum, subject to review and correction by the state board of education. If only \none school be established at first, the school board shall have power at any subsequent time to establish an \nadditional school whenever the necessity for the same shall arise.\" \n[2] The contract carrying into effect the freedom-of-choice plan, is dated February 23, 1968, and provides in \npart as follows: \n\"Any white or Negro student now, or hereafter residing in Coahoma County School District may, at his or her \nselection, without assignment, attend either the Coahoma County High School or the Agricultural High \nSchool.\" \n[3] Section 6475-01, Mississippi Code 1942, Annotated, Recompiled, Laws 1950, ch. 369, § 1. \n[4] Id. § 6475-03, Laws 1950, ch. 369, § 3. \n[5] See Exhibit K to answer of defendants to the Court's request of May 19, 1970. \n[6] An analysis of the student population, according to the latest information available to the Court is: \n           STUDENT POPULATION ATTENDING               SCHOOL AT PRESENT \nTIME                                    White    Black    Total  Grades \n9-12   Coahoma County High School       341      63       404   Coahoma \nAgriculture     High School                    -0-     972       972                                   \n____   _____     _____                                    341    1035      \n1376 Grades 7-8   Coahoma County Jr.-     High School                    \n147       8       155   Elsewhere in County Schools      -0-     879       \n879                                   ____   _____     _____                                    \n147     887      1034 Grades 1-6 (Plus Special   Education Classes)               \n102    3540      3642                                   ____   _____     \n_____                                    102    3540      3642  Grand \nTotal of all students        590    5462      6052  \n[7] Singleton v.

He sought to suppress \nevidence obtained or derived from surveillance conducted pursuant to Section 702 of the FISA \nAmendments Act (\"FAA\"), codified at 50 U.S.C. § 188la (alternatively, \"702 surveillance\" or \n\"702 collection\"). See Def. 's Mot. to Supp., ECF No. 92 (\"Def. Br.\"). This memorandum \nexplains my February 20, 2015 ruling denying the motion to suppress. \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \nFew things are more unsettling than the idea that a government is spying on its \nown citizens.1  Our country has a long history of holding our government accountable when it \nabuses its authority in ways that offend our Constitution's protections. \nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the public was outraged over the revelation that the \ngovernment conducted domestic surveillance- in the name of national security--ofDr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr., Vietnam War protesters, and domestic groups the government labeled \n'subversive.\"  See David S. Kris & J. Douglas Wilson, 1 National Security Investigations and \n\"Citizen\" in this opinion refers to both United States citizens and lawful permanent residents. \n\nProsecutions § 3.1 (2d ed. 20 12) (hereafter \"Kris & Wilson\").  In 1967, the Supreme Court held \nthat electronic surveillance is subject to the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable \nsearches.  Katz v.  United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967) (the government's electronic surveillance \nof a phone conversation in a telephone booth constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment); \nBerger.v. New York, 388 U.S. 41 (1967) (the Fourth Amendment protects conversations, and the \nuse of electronic devices to capture a conversation is a search).  In 1976, a select committee of \nthe United States Senate, chaired by Senator Frank Church ofldaho, issued an exhaustive report \n(the \"Church Report\") documenting the intelligence community's systematic violations of the \nlaw in gathering information about United States citizens.  Kris & Wilson § 2.2 (citing Final \nRep. of the S. Select Comm. to Study Governmental Operations with respect to Intelligence \nActivities (Book II), S. Rep. No. 94-755, (1976)).  Congress responded to the Church Report in \n1978 by enacting the Foreign lntelligence Surveillance Act (\"FISA\"), 50 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq., \nwhich governs foreign intelligence surveillance and searches.  SeeS. Rep. No. 95-604, at 7-8 \n(1977). \nHistory repeats itself.  The post-9/11 era has once again highlighted the tension \nbetween privacy and national security interests.  The public continues to scrutinize the \ngovernment's intelligence gathering techniques.2  But there is also no denying that in this era \nthere are individuals and groups dedicated to inflicting grave harm on our nation, and that the \nintelligence gathering techniques at issue here are a critical component of our government's \nefforts to protect us from harm.  The government has a duty to respect and protect our \nSee, e.g., Charlie Savage, FB.I. is Broadening Surveillance Role, Report Shows, N.Y.

This is a difficult task. \nAnd while there has been legitimate criticism of electronic surveillance practices under the \nFAA-in large part because it has been shrouded in secrecy-in this case, the government \nconducted its national security investigation within the confines of the Fourth Amendment. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA.  The Criminal Investigation \nAn investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Joint Terrorism Task \nForce (\"JTTF\") revealed that from April2, 2011 to August 28, 2011, Hasbajrami exchanged \nnumerous emails with an individual he believed was associated with a terrorist organization. \nGov't Unclassified Br. at 5 (\"Gov't Br.\").  Hasbajrami sent money to the individual to support \nIslamic fundamentalist terrorism operations. !d.  He also arranged to travel to the Federally \nAdministered Tribal Areas (\"FATA\") ofPakistan to join ajihadist fighting group. !d. \nOn September 6, 2011, JTTF agents arrested Hasbajrami at John F. Kennedy \nInternational Airport as he was about to board a flight to Turkey en route to Pakistan. !d.  A \nsubsequent search ofHasbajrami's luggage \"revealed a tent, boots, and cold-weather gear.\"  Def. \nBr. at 4 (citing PSR at~~ 2-3).  Hasbajrami gave detailed statements regarding his offense.  Jd. \nB.  The Government's Disclosure of its FISA Surveillance \nTitle T and Title rTI ofFTSA, as amended, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1812 and 1821-\n1829, allow electronic surveillance and physical searches after obtaining a FISA warrant from \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"'FISC\"). \nOn September 13, 2011  after Hasbajrami was arraigned, the government notified \nhim that he had been subject to FISA surveillance and that it intended at trial to use information \nobtained or derived from that surveillance (\"Title I collection\") and certain physical searches \n3 \n\n(\"Title III collection\").  Notice, ECF No. 9.  On April 12, 2012, after the government disclosed \ninculpatory evidence-including email communications obtained pursuant to FISA-Hasbajrami \npled guilty to a single count of providing material support to terrorists.  ECF No. 32.  On January \n8, 2013, I sentenced him principally to a 180-month term of imprisonment.  ECF No. 44. \nIn July 2013, Hasbajrami filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, seeking \nrelief from his conviction and sentence on the ground that the statute under which he was \nconvicted is unconstitutionally vague.  Letter, ECF No. 61-1.  Before that claim could be fully \nbriefed and argued, the government revealed new information that eventually became the basis \nofthe instant motion.  Specifically, on February 24, 2014, the government notified Hasbajrami \n\"that certain evidence or information, obtained or derived from Title I or III FISA collection, that \nthe government intended to offer into evidence or otherwise use or disclose in proceedings in this \ncase was derived from acquisition of foreign intelligence information conducted pursuant to the \nFAA.\"  Supplemental Notice, ECF No. 65. \nThe FAA permits, subject to certain statutory requirements, the interception of \nelectronic communications of non-U.S. persons reasonably believed to be located outside the \nUnited States in order to acquire foreign intelligence information.  50 U.S.C. §188la.  It differs \nsignificantly from traditional FISA surveillance. To get a court order, FISA requires the \ngovernment to demonstrate probable cause to believe that the \"target of the electronic \nsurveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power\" and that \"each of the facilities or \nplaces at which the electronic surveillance is directed is being used, or is about to be used, by a \nforeign power or an agent of a foreign power.\"  50 U.S.C. § 1805(2).  By contrast, FAA \nsurveillance does not require the government to specify the persons or places that it plans to \ntarget for surveillance.  50 U.S.C. §188la.  Instead, the FISC may authorize surveillance under \n4 \n\nthe FAA for up to one year after approving targeting and minimization procedures and receiving \na government certification regarding the proposed surveillance.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1881 a( a), (c), \nand (i)(3)(A). Because the FAA does not require an individual court authorization (that is, a \nwarrant) for each data collection, FAA-derived intelligence has been described as \"warrantless \nwiretap\" information. See, e.g., Charlie Savage, Federal Prosecutors, in a Policy Shift, Cite \nWarrantless Wiretaps as Evidence, N.Y. Times, Oct. 27,2013, at A21. \nC.  The Withdrawal of the Guilty Plea \nOn October 2, 2014, I allowed Hasbajrami to withdraw his guilty plea so he could \nchallenge the constitutionality of the FAA-derived evidence and seek its suppression.3  Order, \nECF No. 85. Hasbajrami filed this motion to suppress on November 26, 2014, and I heard oral \nargument on the motion on January 23, 2015.  On February 20, 2015, I denied the motion for the \nreasons discussed below.  On June 26, 2015, Hasbajrami pled guilty to one count of attempting \nand one count of conspiring to provide material support to terrorists. ECF No. 142.  I sentenced \nhim on August 13, 2015, principally to a 192-month term of imprisonment.  ECF No. 151. \nDISCUSSION  . \nHasbajrami contends that the FAA surveillance violated the Fourth Amendment \nbecause it was not \"confined to the collection of foreign communications by foreign actors\" \noutside the United States.  Def. Br. at 15-16.  Because the government knew that the \nSpecifically, I allowed Hasbajrami to: \n(W]ithdraw his plea of guilty because 1 conclude that he was \nnot sufficiently informed about the facts.  Under the precise \ncircumstances presented here, and  because of a DOJ  policy \nthat transcended this case, Hasbajrami could not have made an \nintelligent decision about whether to plead guilty: When the \ngovernment  provided  FISA  notice  without  FAA  notice, \nHasbajrami was misled about an important aspect of his case. \nOrder, ECF No. 85, at 6. \n5 \n\ncommunications ofU.S. persons- like Hasbajrami-inevitably would be collected, the argument \ngoes, it was required to get a warrant.  See id.  Hasbajrami thus sought to suppress the FISA \nevidence on which the government's case was based because it was the fruit ofthe warrantless \nFAA surveillance. \nFor its part, the government argues that the FAA collection was constitutional \nbecause: (1) the warrant requirement is inapplicable to foreign intelligence collection targeted at \nforeign persons abroad, and the incidental collection ofU.S. persons' communications did not \ntrigger the warrant requirement; (2) the foreign intelligence exception to the warrant requirement \napplies; and (3) the FAA surveillance was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. \nAccordingly, the government's argument continues, the FISC properly used the FAA-derived \ninformation in finding probable cause to support the FISA warrants, and the FISA collection was \nthus constitutionally sound.4 \nA.  The History oft he Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nAs mentioned above, the government's surveillance activities came under scrutiny \nin the 1970s when it was discovered that the National Security Agency (\"NSA\") had been spying \non United States citizens within the United States. ACLU v. Clapper, 785 F.3d 787, 792-93 (2d \nCir. 2015).  In 1972, the Supreme Court held that warrantless domestic surveillance violated the \nFourth Amendment.  United States v. US Dist. Court for the E. Dist. ofM  ich. (\"Keith\"), 407 \nU.S. 297, 320-21 (1972).  Three years later, Congress established the Select Committee to Study \nGovernmental Operations with respect to Intelligence Activities (the \"Church Committee\") to \ninvestigate whether the government's \"intelligence activities were governed and controlled \nconsistently with the fundamental principles of American constitutional government[.]\"  Church \nSpecifically, the FlSC found that probable cause existed to believe that the target was an agent of a \nforeign power and that the target was using or about to use the facilities and places targeted for the FISA \nsurveillance and search.  Gov't Classified Br. at 23 (\"Gov't Cl. Br.\"). \n6 \n\nReport at v.  The Church Committee found that the intelligence community had \"violated \nspecific statutory prohibitions and infringed the constitutional rights of American citizens [and \nhad) intentionally disregarded [these prohibitions] in the belief that because the programs served \nthe 'national security' the law did not apply.\"5  Id. at 137.  The Church Committee's findings, \ncoupled with the Supreme Court's Keith decision and evidence of abuse by intelligence agencies, \nled to Congress's 1978 enactment ofFISA, which was \"aimed at curtailing abuses and \ndelineating the procedures to be employed in conducting surveillance in foreign intelligence \ninvestigations.\"  Clapper, 785 F.3d at 793. \n1.  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nFISA seeks to \"provide effective, reasonable safeguards to ensure accountability \nand prevent improper surveillance.\"  S. Rep. No. 95-604, at 7 (1977). The statute created the \nFISC and empowered it to grant or deny applications for surveillance orders in foreign-\nintelligence investigations.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1803(a).  \"As originally enacted, FISA required a \nhigh-ranking member ofthe executive branch to certify that the purpose [of the FISA \napplication] was to obtain foreign intelligence information.\"  United States v. Abu-Jihaad, 630 \nF.3d 102, 119 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But in 2001, the Uniting and \nStrengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct \nTerrorism Act (\"USA PATRIOT Act\") amended the statute to require a high-ranking official to \ncertify that \"a significant purpose\" of the FISA application was to obtain foreign intelligence \ninformation.  Pub. L. No. 107-56, 115 Stat. 272,291 (2001) (codified as amended at 50 U.S.C. § \n1804(a)(6)(B)).  Thus, the amendments signaled that Congress no longer required foreign \nIntelligence agencies' illegal activities included covert mail-opening programs, warrantless \n\"suJTeptitious entries,\" i.e., break-ins, and the interception of domestic telegram and radio communications.  Church \nReport at 139. \n7 \n\nintelligence gathering to be the primary purpose of the FISA surveillance.  See Abu-Jihaad, 630 \nF.3d at 119. \nTo obtain a FISA order, the government must make detailed factual showings \nabout the target of the surveillance, the information sought, and the facilities at which the \nsurveillance is directed.  50 U.S.C. § I 804(a).  The FISC may issue an order authorizing \nelectronic surveillance only if it finds probable cause to believe that the target of the surveillance \nis a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power and that the facilities or places at which the \nsurveillance is directed are being used, or are about to be used, by a foreign power or an agent of \na foreign power. !d. § l805(a)(2)(A)-(B).  A FISA order targeting a U.S. person may be \napproved for up to 90 days, and an order targeting a non-U.S. person may be approved for up to \n120 days.  !d. § 1805(d )( 1) . \nFISA requires the government to implement minimization procedures reasonably \ndesigned to minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the dissemination of, \ncommunications by United States citizens.6  Id.  §§ 1801(h)(l), 1821(4)(A).  The Attorney \nGeneral must approve all FISA applications to the FISC. !d. § 1805(a)(l). \n2.  The Protect America Act and the FISA Amendments Act \nUnder FISA, the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" was limited to four types \nof domestically-focused foreign intelligence collection activities. 7  See 50 U.S.C. § 1801 (f). \nThe Attorney General has adopted standard minimization procedures (\"SMPs\") for FISA \nauthorized surveillance and physical searches.  Gov't Cl. Br. at 30. They are on file with the FISC and are \nincorporated by reference into every FISA application and every FISA order.  !d.  The FISC orders at issue here \ndirected the government to follow the approved minimization procedures in conducting the electronic surveillance \nand physical searches. Jd. \n7  Specifically, \"electronic surveillance\" was defined to mean: (t) the acquisition ofthe contents of a \nwire or radio communication obtained by \"intentionally targeting\" a \"particular, known United States person who is \nin the United States\" in certain circumstances; (2) the acquisition of the contents of a wire communication to or from \na \"person in the United States\" when the \"acquisition occurs in the United States\"; (3) the intentional acquisition of \nthe contents of certain radio communications when the \"sender and all intended recipients are located within the \nUnited States\"; and ( 4) the installation or use of a surveillance device \"in the United States\" for monitoring or to \n8 \n\nBecause that definition did not apply to surveillance conducted outside the United States, \nCongress enacted the Protect America Act (\"PAA'') in 2007, Pub. L. No. 110-55, 121 Stat. 552 \n(2007), to modernize FISA in light of the \"changes in communications technology\" since 1978. \nS. Rep. No. 110-209 (Oct. 26, 2007) (\"For example, in 1978, most foreign communications went \nthrough the air rather than over a wire .... Today, most international communications travel \nover a wire.\"). The PAA empowered the Director ofNational Intelligence (\"DNI\") and the \nAttorney General to authorize \"the acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning \npersons reasonably believed to be outside the United States.\"  !d.§ 105B(a).  The PAA required \nthe DNI and the Attorney General to certify that there were reasonable targeting procedures in \nplace to ensure that the surveillance targeted persons reasonably believed to be outside the \nUnited States; that the minimization procedures in place satisfied FISA's requirements for such \nprocedures; and that a significant purpose of the acquisition was to obtain foreign intelligence \ninformation.  !d. § 10 5B(a)(l)-(5). \nThe P AA, however, expired in February 2008 due to a sunset provision.  In \nresponse, in July 2008, Congress enacted the FAA.  The provision of the FAA at issue here, \nSection 702, \"supplements pre-existing FISA authority by creating a new framework under \nwhich the Government may seek the FISC's authorization of certain foreign intelligence \nsurveillance targeting ... non-U.S. persons located abroad.\"8  Clapper v. Amnesty Jnt 'I USA, 133 \nS. Ct. 1138, 1144 (2013).  Specifically, Section 702 (like the PAA before it) provides that upon \nthe issuance of an order from the FISC, the Attorney General and the DNI may jointly authorize \nthe \"targeting of persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States\" for a \nacquire information other than from a wire or radio communication in certain circumstances.  50 U.S.C. § 180l(t) \n(emphasis added). \n8  The definition of a U.S. person under Section 702 is incorporated from Title I ofFISA and means \na citizen of the United States or a lawful permanent resident.  50 U.S.C. §§ 1801 (i), I 88l(a). Hasbajrami is a lawful \npermanent resident. \n9 \n\nperiod of up to one year to acquire \"foreign intelligence information.\"  50 U.S.C. § 188la(a). \nThis includes any information \"necessary to protect against the full range of foreign threats to \nnational security, and information with respect to a foreign power that is necessary to the \nnational defense or foreign affairs.\" Kris & Wilson§ 17.3 (citing 50 U.S.C. §§ 188la(a), \n1801 (e)).  Consistent with its purpose, the statute prohibits intentionally targeting anyone located \ninside the United States and any United States citizens outside of the United States.9  50 U.S.C. \n§ 1881a(b)(l)-(3). \nSurveillance conducted pursuant to Section 702 does not require an individualized \ncourt order for each non-U.S. person to be targeted.  Rather, the FISC approves annual \ncertifications by the Attorney General and the DNI, thereby authorizing the acquisition of foreign \nintelligence information by targeting non-U.S. persons reasonably believed to be located outside \nthe United States.10  Jd. § 1881 a( a), (i)(3).  The statute does not require the certifications to \n9  Under§ l88la(b), the government: \"(1) may not intentionally target any person known at the time \nof acquisition to be located in the United States; (2) may not intentionally target a person reasonably believed to be \nlocated outside the United States if the purpose ... is to target a particular, known person reasonably believed to be \nin the United States; (3) may not intentionally target a United States person reasonably believed to be located \noutside the United States; (4) may not intentionally acquire any communication as to which the sender and all \nintended recipients are known at the time of the acquisition to be located in the United States; and (5) [an \nacquisition] shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the [F]ourth [A]mendment.\" 50 U.S.C. § 1881 a(b)( 1) \n(5). Amici argue that one of the purposes of Section 702 was to enable \"reverse targeting,\" i.e., the legal targeting of \na non-U.S. person abroad to capture the communications of U.S. persons that are otherwise subject to the warrant \nrequirement, Amici Br. at 13, but the statute explicitly prohibits such targeting.  See id § 1881 a(b)(2). \nThe NSA's determination of the target's location and non-U.S. person status is based on the \ntotality of the circumstances. Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Bd., Report on the Surveillance Program \nOperated Pursuant to Section 702 ofth e Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act at 43 (July 2, 20 14), available at \nhttps://www.pclob.gov/library/702-Report.pdf (\"PCLOB Report\").  If conflicting information draws the target's \nlocation or status into question, the NSA must resolve the question before the person can be targeted.  Id at 44.  In \nmaking the determination that the surveillance will lead to the acquisition of foreign intelligence information, the \nNSA must identify the specific foreign power or foreign territory from which the intelligence is being sought.  /d at \n45. \n10  The Attorney General and the DNI must make the certifications, 50 U.S.C. § 188la(g)(l), and \nthey must attest that: (1) there are targeting procedures in place, which have been or will be submitted for approval \nby the FISC, that are reasonably designed to ensure that the acquisition is limited to targeting persons reasonably \nbelieved to be located outside the United States and to prevent the intentional acquisition of purely domestic \ncommunications; (2) the minimization procedures meet the definition of minimization procedures set forth in Titles I \nand lli of FISA (50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(h), 1821 ( 4)) and have been or will be submitted for approval by the FISC; (3) \nguidelines have been adopted by the Attorney General to ensure compliance with the aforementioned limitations set \nforth in § l88la(b) prohibiting, among other things, the targeting of U.S. persons; ( 4) the targeting and minimization \n10 \n\nidentify the facilities to be targeted for surveillance.  Jd. § 1881a(g)(4).  Instead, the FISC \napproves the proposed targeting and minimization procedures, and if it finds that the certification \ncontains the required elements and that those procedures are consistent with the Fourth \nAmendment, it issues an order authorizing the certification.  See id. § 1881 a(i)(3)(A). \nThe targeting procedures must be \"reasonably designed\" to ensure that the \nsurveillance is limited to persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States, and \nto \"prevent the intentional acquisition of any communication as to which the sender and all \nintended recipients are known at the time of the acquisition to be located in the United States.\" \nJd. § 1881 a(g)(2)(A)(i).  Minimization procedures must also be \"reasonably designed .. . to \nminimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the dissemination, of nonpublicly available \ninformation concerning unconsenting United States persons consistent with the need of the \nUnited States to obtain, produce, and disseminate foreign intelligence information.\"  50 U.S.C. \n§§ 180l(h)(l), 1821(4)(A).  Thus, the targeting and minimization procedures aim to safeguard \nU.S. citizens against the acquisition of their communications under Section 702. \n3.  Types ofF AA Surveillance \nThere are two types of Section 702 collection: PRISM and Upstream.  See \nPCLOB Report at 7, 33.  ln PRISM collection, the government identifies the user accounts it \nwants to monitor and sends a \"selector\"-a specific communications facility, such as a target s \nemail address or telephone number-to the relevant communications service provider. Jd. at 32-\n33.  A government directive then compels the communications service provider to give it \nprocedures and guidelines are consistent with the Fourth Amendment; (5) a significant purpose of the acquisition is \nto obtain foreign intelligence information; (6) the acquisition involves obtaining \"foreign intelligence information \nfrom or with the assistance of an electronic communication service provider;\" and (7) the acquisition complies with \nthe limitations in 50 U . . C. §1881 a(b) (i.e., the targeting procedures).  50 U.S.C. § 1881a(g)(2)(A). \n11 \n\ncommunications sent to or from that selector (i.e., the government \"tasks\" the selector).11  Jd. at \n33; 50 U.S.C. § 188la(h). This type of surveillance, which intercepts \"to/from\" \ncommunications, can result in the interception of communications with U.S. persons if the target \nhappens to communicate with such a person.  See PCLOB Report at 33. \nUpstream collection, on the other hand, involves the acquisition of \ncommunications through the compelled assistance of the providers that control the \ntelecommunications backbone within the United States over which communications travel.  ld. at \n35.  Like PRISM, upstream collection intercepts \"to/from\" communications. !d. at 37.  But \nupstream collection is less tailored than PRISM collection; it allows the government to \nadditionally intercept \"about\" communications, that is, communications that refer to, or are \n\"about,\" a particular selector. !d.  For example, an email in the body of which a targeted email \naddress appears is an \"about\" communication, even though the targeted person is not necessarily \na participant in the intercepted communication.12  !d.  If a communication is to, from, or about a \nII  Before a selector can be ''tasked,\" that is, before service providers are compelled to forward \ncommunications associated with a selector, the NSA analyst must document his or her reasons for tasking it, and \ntwo senior NSA analysts must approve the tasking.  NSA Director of Civil Liberties and Privacy Office Report, \nNSA 's Implementation of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Section 702, at 4-5 (Apr. 16, 2014 ), available at \nhttps://www.nsa.gov/civil_liberties/_  files/nsa_report_ on_section_ 702_ program.pdf (''NSA Report\"). In PRISM \ncollection, \"the Government provides selectors to service providers through the FBI. The service providers are \ncompelled to provide NSA with communications to or from these selectors.\" NSA Report at 5. \n12  The PCLOB Report provides a detailed description of the mechanics of Upstream collection: \nFinally,  the  upstream  collection  of Internet  communications  includes  two \nfeatures that are not present in PRISM collection: the acquisition of so-called \n'about'  communications  and  the  acquisition  of  so-called  'multiple \ncommunications transactions' ('MCTs').  An 'about' communication is one in \nwhich the selector of a targeted person (such as that person's email address) is \ncontained within the communication but the targeted person is not necessarily a \nparticipant in the communication.  Rather than being 'to' or 'from' the selector \nthat has been tasked, the communication may contain the selector in the body of \nthe communication, and thus be 'about' the selector.  An MCT is an  Internet \n'transaction' that contains more than one discrete communication within it.  If \none of the communications within an  MCT is  to, from, or 'about'  a tasked \nselector, and if one end of the transaction is foreign, the NSA will acquire the \nentire  MCT  through  upstream  collection,  including  other  discrete \ncommunications within the MCT that do not contain the selector. \n12 \n\ntasked selector, the NSA can acquire an entire MCT, which may contain more than one discrete \ncommunication. ld. at 39-41.  Simply put, the government can collect other discrete \ncommunications that do not have anything to do with the tasked selector, which can result in the \ncollection and querying of wholly domestic communications of non-targeted persons.13  Jd. at 7; \nNSA Report at 5-6.  Some have argued that the FISC erred in its approval in 2011 of \"about\" \ncommunications collection, instead of limiting Section 702 surveillance to communications \nintercepted by \"to/from\" collection.  See, e.g., Donohue at 159; First Amended Complaint, \nWikimedia Found. v. NSA, 15-CV-00662, ~ 50 (D. Md. June 19, 2015) (equating upstream \ncollection with allowing \"a government agent [to] open every piece of mail that comes through \nthe post to determine whether it mentions a particular word or phrase\"). \nThe government conducted the disputed surveillance in this case under the \nPRISM program. Gov't Cl. Br. at 54.  None of the Section 702 communications used in the \nTitle I and Title II FISA applications targeting the agent of a foreign power were \"about\" \ncommunications. I d.  Thus, the constitutionality of upstream collection is not at issue here. \nB.  The Constitutionality ofS ection 702 is Limited to an As Applied Challenge \nAs a preliminary matter, Hasbajrami asserts a facial challenge and an \"as applied\" \nchallenge to the constitutionality of Section 702 collection.  Def. Br. at 13-31.  A facial challenge \nwould require Hasbajrami to establish that there is no set of circumstances under which Section \n702 is valid.  United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987).  Given that the government \n\"implemented [the statute] in a defined context\" in this case, 1 need not \"speculate about the \nPCLOB Report at 7. \n13  \"FISC estimated in 2011 that somewhere between 300,000 and 400,000 MCTs were being \ncollected annually on the basis of 'about' communication-where the 'active user' was not the target.  So hundreds \nof thousands of communications were being collected that did not include the target as either the sender or the \nrecipient of the communication.\"  Laura K. Donohue, Section 702 and the Collection of International Telephone and \nInternet Content, 38 Harv. J .L. & Pub. Pol'y 117 (20 15), available at http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu \n/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2364&context=facpub. \n13 \n\nvalidity of the law as it might be applied in different ways or on different facts.\"  In re \nDirectives, 551 F.3d 1004, 1010 (FJSA Ct. Rev. 2008); see also Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of \nN. New England, 546 U.S. 320, 328-30 (2006) (discussing the Court's preference for as-applied \nchallenges in an attempt to \"limit the solution to the problem\"); United States v. Mohamud, 2014 \nWL 2866749, at *13-14 (D. Oreg. June 24, 2014) (declining to consider a facial challenge under \nthe Fourth Amendment to Section 702 collection).  I therefore I im it Hasbajram i 's challenge to an \nas-applied challenge. \nC.  Warrantless Surveillance Pursuant to Section 702 is Lawful Under the Fourth \nAmendment When It Targets Non-U.S Persons Abroad \nThe Fourth Amendment protects an individual's \"persons, houses, papers, and \neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\"  For a search or seizure to be consistent \nwith the Fourth Amendment, it must be carried out with a valid warrant, based on probable \ncause, and be issued by a neutral and detached judicial officer (or fall under one ofthe \nexceptions to the warrant requirement).  The central inquiry in my Fourth Amendment analysis is \n\"the reasonableness in all the circumstances ofthe particular governmental invasion of a \ncitizen's personal security.\"  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. l, 19 (1968). Because Section 702 does not \nrequire a warrant before the government can seize the communications of non-U.S. persons \nabroad, the dispute before me centers on whether the search of communications between a U.S. \nperson and individuals who are legitimate targets of Section 702 surveillance is constitutional. \nFor the reasons that follow, I conclude that it is. \n1.  The Fourth Amendment Does Not Apply to Foreign Persons Abroad \nThe Fourth Amendment's protections do not \"apply to activities of the United \nStates directed against aliens in foreign territory.\"  United States v.  Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. \n259, 267 (1990) (non-U.S. persons outside the United States who lack a \"substantial connection\" \n14 \n\nwith the country do not benefit from the Fourth Amendment's protections).  Accordingly, under \nVerdugo-Urquidez, the Fourth Amendment does not constrain the government from collecting \nthe communications of non-U.S. individuals targeted by Section 702 surveillance.  The \ncollection at issue was directed at non-U.S. persons the government reasonably (and correctly) \nbelieved were located in foreign countries.  Although Hasbajrami was a legal resident ofthe \nUnited States who was in the country when he communicated with one or more non-U.S. persons \nabroad, it was those non-U.S. persons who were the targets of Section 702 surveillance. \nDefendant and amici challenge the fact that the FAA allows the government to \ncollect these communications without establishing probable cause or finding individualized \nsuspicion. Def. Br. at 6, 10-11; Amici Br. at 14.  However, because the warrant requirement is \ninapplicable here, so too is the need to establish probable cause or individualized suspicion. \n2.  The Incidental Collection of U.S. Persons' Communications with Lawfully \nTargeted Non-U.S. Persons Abroad Does Not Trigger the Warrant Requirement \nThe real question is whether the incidental interception of U.S. persons' \ncommunications during the otherwise lawful collection of non-U.S. persons' communications is \nconstitutional.  While Section 702 does not allow intentional targeting of U.S. persons or non-\nU.S. persons located in the United States, 50 U.S.C. §188la(b)(l)-(4), it is inevitable that the \ngovernment will incidentally intercept communications of persons who are not the intended \ntargets-including, as here, U.S. persons in the United States--during the ordinary course of \nlawfu I survei !lance. \nMinimization and targeting procedures help protect the privacy interests ofU.S. \npersons whose communications are incidentally intercepted.  Minimization procedures mask the \nidentities of U.S. persons whose communications the government incidentally collects.  See In re \nDirectives, 551  F.3d at 1015 (effective minimization procedures \"serve ... as a means of \n15 \n\nreducing the impact of incidental intrusions into the privacy of non-targeted United States \npersons\").  The minimization procedures in this case required the NSA to conduct post-targeting \nanalyses to effectuate a stop of the acquisition of communications without delay if it learned at \nany point that the target had either entered the United States or was in fact a U.S. person.  Gov't \nCl. Br. at 108. \nHasbajrami contends that the collection of U.S. persons' communications during \n702 surveillance targeting non-U.S. persons abroad cannot be properly considered \"incidental\" \nbecause the government knows that the foreign targets will inevitably communicate with U.S. \npersons, Def. Br. at 11-12, and the minimization procedures permit the government to retain the \ncommunications under certain circumstances.  Gov't Br. at 3 I (\"Such circum tances may include \nwhere the U.S. person has consented to the dissemination, the specific information about the \nU.S. person is already publicly available, the U.S. person's identity is necessary to understand \nforeign intelligence information, or the communication contains evidence of a crime and is being \ndisseminated to law enforcement authorities.\" (citing PCLOB Rep. at 64-65)).  However, the \ngovernment notes that the same is true ofTitle I FlSA surveillance and Title lil electronic \nsurveillance, \"in which, inevitably, the government collects communications of third parties and \nthe minimization procedures permit retention of those communications in certain \ncircumstances.\"  Gov't Cl. Br. at 80.  As with the FTSA and Title Til collection, acquisitions from \nSection 702 surveillance are not made unlawful by ''incidental collections occurring as a result of \nconstitutionally permissible acquisitions.\"  In re Directives, 551  F.3d at I 015 (warrantless \nsurveillance of individuals reasonably believed to be outside the United States under the PAA \nwas reasonable).  The collection of U.S. persons' communications- incidentally obtained \nthrough lawful targeting-does not require a separate warrant. \n16 \n\nCourts have long dealt with the issue of incidental interception of non-targeted \npersons' communications.14  Amici correctly point out that some of those cases involve \nsurveillance predicated on warrants, Amici Br. at 14 (citing Kahn, 415 U.S. at 143 and Figueroa, \n757 F.2d at 466), but that is because the targets at issue were U.S. citizens and the surveillance \ntook place on United States soil.  See Kahn, 415 U.S. at 144-49 and Figueroa, 757 F.2d at 468-\n69.  A warrant was necessary for the initial surveillances to be lawful.  While those cases are thus \ndistinguishable, the guiding principle behind them applies with equal force here: when \nsurveillance is lawful in the first place-whether it is the domestic surveillance ofU.S. persons \npursuant to a warrant, or the warrantless surveillance of non-U.S. persons who are abroad15-the \nincidental interception of non-targeted U.S. persons' communications with the targeted persons \nis also lawful.  Mohamud, 2014 WL 2866749, at* 15 (\"The§ 702 acquisition targeting a non-\nU.S. person overseas is constitutionally permissible, so, under the general rule, the incidental \ncollection of defendant's communications with the extraterritorial target would be lawful.\").16 \n14  See, e.g., United States v. Kahn, 415 U.S. 143, 157-58 (1974) (interception ofwife's conversations \non her home telephone was incidental. and not in violation of the Fourth Amendment, because her criminal activities \nwere not foreseen when Title Ill wiretap order targeting her husband was obtained); United States v. Figueroa, 757 \nF.2d 466,472-73 (2d Cir. 1985) (Title lJl allows interception of conversations of\"others as yet unknown,\" i.e., \nunknown third parties and that \"does not render a statute [] unconstitutional on its face as authorizing a general \nwarrant\"); United States v. Butenko, 494 F.2d 593, 608 (3d Cir. 1974) (upholding the constitutionality of warrantless \nsurveillance for foreign intelligence purposes even though \"conversations .. . of American citizens[] will be \noverheard\"); United States v. Bin Laden, 126 F. Supp. 2d 264, 280 (S.D.N .Y. 2000) (\"[l]ncidental interception of a \nperson's conversations during an otherwise lawful surveillance is not violative of the Fourth Amendment.\"). \n15  The government concedes that information-gathering under Section 702 takes place within the \nUnited States.  Gov't Br. at 43.  But what matters here is the location of the target.  See Kris & Wilson, § 17.3 (\"For \nnon-U.S. person targets, there is no probable-cause requirement; the only thing that matters is []the government's \nreasonable belief about[] the target's location.\"). The mere fact that Section 702 surveillance originated from within \nthe United States, or that the communications obtained through such surveillance originated from  or terminated \nwithin the United States, is not enough to trigger the warrant requirement.  The government intercepted the emails in \nthis case because Hasbajrami communicated with foreign persons outside the United States, at email addresses \nbelieved to belong to them.  Section 702 requires that the government reasonably believe that the non-U.S. person is \nlocated outside the United States in order to target them. 50 U.S.C. § 1881 a( a).  The facts here indicate that the \ngovernment reasonably (and correctly) believed that the persons Hasbajrami communicated with were non-U.S. \npersons abroad, and thus the government was well within its boundaries. That the seizure took place from within the \nUnited States does not alter these facts, and therefore does not implicate the warrant requirement. \n16  Hasbajrami also contends that the FAA is unconstitutional because it permits surveillance and \ninterception without probable cause, particularity, or the involvement of a neutral and detached judicial officer.  De f. \n17 \n\n3.  PRISM Collection is Reasonable Under the Fourth Amendment \n\"The ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness[,]\" and the \nrequirement that the PRJSM collection at issue here be reasonable applies even when the warrant \nrequirement does not.  Brigham City, Utah v. Stuart, 547 US 398, 403 (2006).  Thus, J must \ndetermine whether Section 702 meets the general reasonableness standard. !d.  The statute aims \nto collect foreign intelligence information to protect national security. As discussed above, I \nmust balance that interest with U.S. persons' privacy interests in their international \ncommunications.  See Samson v. California, 547 U.S. 843, 848 (2006) (applying the totality of \nthe circumstances test to the Fourth Amendment reasonableness inquiry).  I have balanced these \ninterests and find the intelligence gathering here is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. \na.  The Government Has a Compelling Interest in Obtaining Foreign \nIntelligence Information to Protect National Security \nThe 702 surveillance at issue here furthered an indisputably compelling \ngovernment interest.  See Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1, 28 (2010) \n(\"Everyone agrees that the Government's interest in combating terrorism is an urgent objective \nof the highest order.\"); Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 307 (1981) (\"It is obvious and unarguable \nthat no governmental interest is more compelling than the security of the Nation.\" (internal \nquotation marks omitted)); see also In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1012 (the government's national \nsecurity interest in acquiring foreign intelligence information pursuant to the PAA \"is of the \nhighest order of magnitude\").  The fruits of the surveillance led to the prosecution and conviction \nBr. at 22-30.  But because the warrant requirement is inapplicable here, so too is the necessity for \"the three \nprincipal warrant requirements: prior judicial review, probable cause, and particularity.\" in re Directives, 551 F .3d \nat I 013 (\"We therefore decline the petitioner's invitation to reincorporate into the foreign intelligence exception the \nsame warrant requirements that we already have held inapplicable.\").  Additionally, because l find that the \nsurveillance at issue did not require the government to get a warrant, I consider it unnecessary to determine whether \nthe good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule or the foreign intelligence exception to the warrant requirement \napply, and 1 thus decline to do so. \n18 \n\nof a U.S. person who was attempting to lend support to a terrorist organization whose purpose is \nto inflict serious harm upon the United States. \nb.  Individuals Have a Diminished Expectation ofP  rivacy in Email \nCommunications with Non-U.S. Persons Outside the United States \nIn evaluating the reasonableness of the incidental acquisition of non-targets' \ncommunications, I consider the degree to which U.S. citizens have a reasonable expectation of \nprivacy in their email communications with non-U.S. persons abroad. \nA person's expectation of privacy in email communications diminishes after \nsending the email because he or she assumes the risk that the recipient will share the \ncommunication with others.  See United States v. Lifshitz, 369 F.3d 173, 190 (2d Cir. 2004) \n(\"[An individual] may not ... enjoy[] an expectation of privacy in transmissions over the \nInternet or e-mail that have already arrived at the recipient.\"); Guest v. Leis, 255 F.3d 325, 333 \n(6th Cir. 2001) (email sender loses his or her legitimate expectation of privacy in an email that \nhas already reached the recipient).  Email communications are easily forwarded to or read by \nother parties.  But this diminished expectation of privacy in email communications does not \nmean the government can search every email with impunity just because the email sender \ncommunicated with a foreign person abroad.17 \nAnalogizing to traditional post-mail, the government contends that an email \nsender \"loses any cognizable Fourth Amendment rights\" in the communication once it reaches \nthe recipient.  Gov't Br. at 62; see also United States v. Gordon, 168 F.3d 1222, 1228 (lOth Cir. \n1999) (\"[O]nce a letter is sent to someone, the sender's expectation of privacy ordinarily \n17  I reject the government's contention that \"any expectation of privacy of the defendant in his \nelectronic communications with a non-U.S. person overseas is ... diminished by the prospect that his foreign \ncorrespondent could be a target for surveillance by foreign governments or private entities, whose activities are not \ngoverned by the United States Constitution or federal law, or by the U.S. Government, pursuant to various \nauthorities applicable to foreign intelligence surveillance conducted abroad.\"  Gov't Br. at 62 n.48 (emphasis \nadded). The government's logic is circular, and it risks allowing the fact of the government's lawful surveillance of \nnon-U.S. persons abroad to seep into and erode the rights of United States citizens. \n19 \n\nterminates upon delivery.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  But the loss ofthe privacy \ninterest in that setting typically flows from the recipient's provision of the communication to the \ngovernment. 18  This case, of course, concerns government interception of em ails.  Nonetheless, \ngiven that the emails here had in fact been sent to a third party, I conclude that Hasbajrami had a \ndiminished-if not nonexistent--expectation of privacy in those communications. \nc.  Section 702 's Safeguards and Procedures Sufficiently Protect Non \nTargeted US. Persons' Privacy Interests \nAs part of my inquiry into the reasonableness of searches conducted pursuant to \nSection 702, I also consider the safeguards the government has employed to help protect \nHasbajrami's privacy interest and to ensure that 702 surveillance is appropriately targeted at non-\nU.S. persons located outside the United States.  Section 702 itself requires these safeguards.  The \ngovernment's Section 702 applications in this case included the required certifications by \nExecutive Branch officials-the DNI and the Attorney General-that detailed the targeting and \nminimization procedures used to protect the privacy of U.S. and non-U.S. persons located in the \nUnited States.  Gov't Cl. Br. at 49-52; 50 U.S.C. §§ 188la(a), (g), and (i).  Upon review, the \nFISC approved the certifications, finding that they contained the elements required by Section \n702, and that the targeting and minimization procedures were consistent with the Fourth \nAmendment.  50 U.S.C. §§ 188la(i)(3)(A). The Attorney General and the DNI must also \nperiodically review the government's compliance with the minimization and targeting \n18  See, e.g., United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 443 ( 1976) (\"The [bank] depositor takes the risk, \nin revealing his affairs to another, that the information will be conveyed by that person to the Government.\"); Hoffa \nv. United States, 385 U.S. 293, 302 ( 1966) (\"Neither this Court nor any member of it has ever expressed the view \nthat the Fourth Amendment protects a wrongdoer's misplaced belief that a person to whom he voluntarily confides \nhis wrongdoing will not reveal it.\"); United States v. Maxwell, 45 M.J. 406, 418 (C.A.A.F. 1996) (\"[T]he maker ora \ntelephone call has a reasonable expectation that police officials will not intercept and listen to the conversation; \nhowever, the conversation itself is held with the risk that one of the pa1ticipants may reveal what is said to others.\"). \n20 \n\nprocedures and submit assessments to the FISC and congressional oversight committees.  See 50 \nU.S.C. 1881a(l).19 \nThe oversight provisions of the FAA require the government to regularly report \ninstances of non-compliance to the FISC, which can withhold approval of proposed \nminimization procedures or require the government to amend them to ensure that they are \nreasonably designed to limit the acquisition, retention, and dissemination of information \nconcerning U.S. persons.  See PCLOB Report at 76 (citing FISC Rule ofProc. 13(b)). The \noversight provided by the FISC, the executive branch, and Congress work to safeguard Fourth \nAmendment protections, lending further support to the reasonableness of Section 702 \nsurveillance.  Cf Mohamud, 2014 WL 2866749, at *24 (finding that Section 702's requirements \nfor minimization procedures contribute to the statute's reasonableness); In re Directives, 551 \nF.3d at 1013 (relying on a \"matrix ofsafeguards\"-including targeting and minimization \nprocedures and a procedure to ensure that a significant purpose of the surveillance is to obtain \nforeign intelligence information-in determining that the P AA was reasonable under the Fourth \nAmendment). \nThe most significant of these safeguards are the government's targeting and \nminimization procedures. See, e.g., In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1015 (minimization procedures \n\"serve as an additional backstop against identification errors as well as a means of reducing the \nimpact of incidental intrusions into the privacy of non-targeted United States persons\").  The \ngovernment did not target \"entire geographical areas,\" as the defendant contends, see Def. Br. at \n23, but instead used FISC-approved targeting procedures to target specific non-U.S. persons \n19  In four years of oversight, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence did not find \"a single case \nin which a government official engaged in a willful effort to circumvent or violate the law.\" S. Rep. No. 112-174, at \n7(2012). \n21 \n\nGov't Ct. Br. at 107-111.  \"Strong\" selectors, such as email addresses, weed \nout innocent or inadvertent communications \"[b ]ecause of the small set of people with \nknowledge of the email address or phone number of a subject of foreign intelligence interest.\" \nPeter Margulies, Dynamic Surveillance: Evolving Procedures in Metadata and Foreign Content \nCollection after Snowden, 66 Hastings L. J. 1, 47 (Dec. 20 14) (citing PCLOB Report at 32-33). \nSuch was the case here: the government collected emails to or from unique email addresses \nbecause it reasonably believed the owners of those email addresses were non-U.S. persons \noutside the United States, and that the collection would lead to the acquisition of foreign \nintelligence information. This cannot be characterized as an unreasonably broad form of \ninterception. To the contrary, these FISC-approved targeting procedures were employed-and \nworked--exactly as they were intended to. \nThe government's use of the minimization procedures described above also \nhelped limit the acquisition, retention, and dissemination of information concerning U.S. persons \nunder Section 702, further supporting the reasonableness of the acquisition here.20  See \nMohamud, 2014 WL 2866749, at *24 (Section 702's minimization procedures ameliorate Fourth \nAmendment concerns because they limit \"the retention and dissemination of foreign \ncommunications of or concerning United States persons\" and they require \"the identity of the \nUnited States Person\" to be deleted \"in any dissemination of the information unless certain \nrequirements are met\"); see also In re Directives, 551 F.3d at 1015 (it is \"significant\" that the \n20  That the government is able to query information obtained under the PRISM program, i.e., \nlawfully-obtained communications that were to or from legitimate targets, does not render the minimization \nprocedures inadequate, as amici contend. See Amici Br. at 2\\-22.  Here, once the government learned that the target \nwas potentially an agent of a foreign power, the government sought orders from the FISC for electronic surveillance \nand physical searches pursuant to Title I and Title Ill ofFISA targeting an agent of a foreign power. Gov't Cl. Br. at \n119-20 n.l49. l agree with the government that \"[i]t would be perverse to authorize the unrestricted review of \nlawfully collected information but then[] restrict the targeted review of the same information in response to tailored \ninquiries.\"  Gov't Br. at 71-72. \n22 \n\nminimization procedures help prevent identification errors and reduce the impact of incidental \ninterceptions of non-targeted U.S. persons under the PAA). \nMoreover, before approving the surveillance, the FISC found that the targeting \nand minimization procedures in the government's Section 702 applications were consistent with \nand reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  Specifically, when balancing the government's \nnational security interests against Fourth Amendment interests, the FISC concluded that the \nsurveillance was reasonable in light of the government's important national security interests and \nthe safeguards contained within the targeting and minimization procedures.  All of these \nprocedures help limit the scope of Section 702 surveillance, and thus support the reasonableness \nof that surveillance under the Fourth Amendment. \nIn evaluating the totality of the circumstances and weighing the government's \ninterest in national security with Hasbajrami's diminished privacy interest, the government's \ninterest outweighs the intrusion.  The stringent safeguards embodied in the FAA, i.e., its \ntargeting and minimization procedures, ensured that only the communications of non-U.S. \npersons abroad were collected.  And the targeting that took place in this case was as particular as \nit gets-the FISC approved the targeting of specific non-U.S. persons outside the United States \nfor specific counterterrorism purposes.  The incidental interception ofHasbajrami's emails as a \nconsequence of that lawful surveillance does not alter the reasonableness of the interception. \nD.  The Traditional FISA Information Was Lawfully Acquired Because It Was Obtained \nPursuant to a Warrant Based on Probable Cause \n\"FISA warrant applications are subject to minimal scrutiny by the courts, both \nupon initial presentation and subsequent challenge.\"  Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d at 130 (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  In the FISC's initial review, the FISA Judge must \"( 1) [] find \nprobable cause to believe that the target of the requested surveillance is an agent of a foreign \n23 \n\npower; (2) [] find that the application is complete and in proper form; and (3) when the target is a \nUnited States person, [] find that the certifications are not 'clearly erroneous.\"'  United States v. \nDuggan, 743 F.2d 59, 77 (2d Cir. 1984) . . \nAs in Abu-Jihaad, I find that \"the government's detailed and complete \nsubmissions in this case would easily allow it to clear a higher standard of review\" than the \ndeferential one that I must apply.  630 F.3d at 130.  I have conducted a careful ex parte \nexamination and agree that the certifications here were made in accordance with FISA's \nrequirements and the targeting of an agent of a foreign power was not \"clearly erroneous.\" See \nid.  The certifications explained that a significant purpose of the FISA surveillance was to obtain \nforeign intelligence information21  that could not be reasonably obtained through regular \ninvestigative techniques. \nI have also examined the application materials and find that they meet the \nshowing of probable cause required by FISA.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1805(a)(2).  The government's \nsubmissions here were \"quite detailed and complete; they described at length the facts supporting \nthe Government's assertion that there was probable cause to believe that the target of the FISA \nsurveillance was an agent of a foreign power and ... that a significant purpose of the \nsurveillance was to gather foreign intelligence information.\" Abu-Jihaad, 531 F. Supp. 2d \nat 313. \nSpecifically, the government obtained-pursuant to Section 702 surveillance--\nmany email communications between Hasbajrami and non-U.S. persons reasonably believed to \nbe located outside the United States who were·············· Gov't Cl. \n21  Indeed, the certifications stated that the primary purpose of the surveillance of physical search was \n\"'not to obtain information for the prosecution of crimes other than those [international terrorism and foreign \nintelligence crimes] referred to in [FISA] ... or related to such foreign intelligence crimes.\"' Gov't Cl. Br. at 193 \n(quoting the certifications at issue) (emphasis in original). \n24 \n\nBr. at 3.  The government described these emails in its Title I and Title III FISA applications \ntargeting an agent of a foreign power, and they supported the FISC's finding of probable cause \nthat the target was an agent of a foreign power. See 18 U.S.C. § 1805(a)(2)(A).  In addition, I \nfind that the \"[t]he target is described with particularity, as is the basis for believing that the \nfacilities at which electronic surveillance would occur was being used, or about to be used, by \nthe target and that the premises or property to be searched contained foreign intelligence \ninformation that was owned, used, possessed by, or in transit to or from the target.\"  Abu-Jihaad, \n531 F. Supp. 2d at 313.  The exhaustive submissions I have received in connection with the \napplication provided ample support for my finding that the government met its probable cause \nrequirement. \nLastly, the FISA collection ofHasbajrami's communications adhered to the \napproved minimization procedures.  The test of compliance in the context ofFISA surveillance \nis \"whether [the government attempted] a good faith effort to minimize\" the interception of \ninnocent conversations.  United States v. Mubayyid, 521 F. Supp. 2d 125, 135 (D. Mass. 2007) \n(quoting United States v. Armocida, 515 F.2d 29, 44 (3d Cir. 1975)).  The government made that \neffort here.  In addition to numerous other steps, only authorized personnel were able to review \nthe information acquired, and the identities of U.S. persons were minimized before the \ncommunications were disseminated by the FBI to other agencies.  Gov't. Cl. Br. at 202-04. \nBased on this information, the government lawfully conducted the FISA \nsurveillance at issue.  The government properly made the required certifications and followed the \nminimization procedures, and the applications established probable cause.  As such, the FISA \nevidence need not be suppressed. \n25 \n\nE.  The Motion for Discovery ofF  ISA and 702 Materi(lls \nHasbajrami moved for discovery of the classified materials relating to the Section \n702 and FISA authorizations and collection.  Def. Br. at 66-99.  A court may disclose to a \ndefendant \"under appropriate security procedures and protective orders, portions of the \napplication, order, or other materials relating to the surveillance only where such disclosure is \nnecessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance.\"  50 U.S.C. \n§ 1806(f).  But where a court \"determines that the surveillance was lawfully authorized and \nconducted, it shall deny the motion of the aggrieved person except to the extent that due process \nrequires discovery or disclosure.\" ld. § 1806(f).  With these statutory guidelines in mind, the \nSecond Circuit concluded that disclosure ofFISA materials \"is the exception and ex parte, in \ncamera determination is the rule.\"  United States v. Stewart, 590 F .3d 102, 129 (2d Cir. 201 0). \nThe same ex parte, in camera procedure applies to discovery motions related to Section 702.  See \n50 U.S.C. § 1881e(a). \nAfter careful review of the FISA and Section 702 materials here it is clear to me \nthat disclosure was unnecessary here.  \"It is of course true that the legality of the surveillance and \nsearch would be better tested through the adversarial process,\" Mubayyid, 521 F. Supp. 2d at \n130, but the statute asks me to determine what is necessary to accurately determine whether the \ngovernment complied with the law.  50 U.S.C. § 1806(f).  My review of the materials was \n\"relatively straightforward and not complex[,)\" and I was able to evaluate the legality of the \nchallenged surveillance without concluding that due process first warranted disclosure.  Abu \nJihaad, 630 F.3d at 129 (quoting United States v. Abu-Jihaad, 531 F. Supp. 2d 299, 310-11 (D. \nConn. 2008)).  Specifically, the foreign intelligence information obtained pursuant to the FISA \nand FAA surveillance and searches was lawfully acquired because the collection offoreign \n26 \n\nintelligence pursuant to Section 702's PRISM program complies with the Fourth Amendment, \nand because the government complied with the relevant statutory directives. Given this \ndetermination, disclosure of the materials to the defendant is unnecessary. \nCONCLUSION \nThe incidental collection of Hasbajrami's communications with non-U.S. persons \nabroad-lawfully targeted under Section 702-did not require a warrant and was reasonable in \nlight ofthe Fourth Amendment's protections.  For that reason, Hasbajrami's motion to suppress \nthe evidence obtained from the Section 702 surveillance, along with its fruits, was denied. \nFurther, I find that the government lawfully acquired the traditional FISA information, because it \nwas obtained based upon probable cause and in compliance with the statute's requirements. \nFinally, because the government legally obtained the surveillance at issue, I deny Hasbajrami's \nmotion for discovery of classified materials. \nDated: February 18,2016 \nBrooklyn, New York \n27 ",

Agron Hasbajrami\nCriminal Docket No. 11-623 (S-1)(JG)\nDear Judge Gleeson:\nThe government submits this letter in connection with\nthe defendant’s sentencing, which is scheduled for December 21,\n2012, and in response to the Court’s order that the parties\naddress Section 6B1.2 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. \nFor the reasons set forth below, the government respectfully\nrequests that the Court accept the plea and sentence the\ndefendant to a term of imprisonment of fifteen years.\nI. Background\nAs set forth in the Presentence Investigation Report\n(“PSR”), as amended on October 5, 2012, an investigation by\nagents of the Joint Terrorism Task Force (“JTTF”) revealed that\nbetween April 2, 2011, and August 28, 2011, the defendant\ncommunicated with a Pakistan-based extremist (“Individual #1”)\nwho informed the defendant that he was part of a terrorist\norganization. (PSR ¶ 2).  Individual #1 – a foreign national who\nis not a government agent, and whose identity is known to the\nparties – told the defendant that his group was engaged in\nattacks on American soldiers in Afghanistan.  In addition,\nIndividual #1 promoted violent extremist activity through\ninternet communications and publications, and solicited funds\nthat he represented would be used to support terrorist\noperations.  During the course of their communications, the\ndefendant sent approximately $1,000 to Individual #1 to support\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-JG   Document 39   Filed 11/21/12   Page 2 of 11 PageID #: 266\nIslamic fundamentalist terrorist operations.  In addition, the\ndefendant and Individual #1 planned for the defendant’s travel\nfrom New York to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (“FATA”)\nof Pakistan, where the defendant hoped to join a jihadist\nfighting group.  During their communications, the defendant\ndiscussed with Individual #1 his desire to “marry with the girls\nin paradise” – that is, to die as a martyr while engaged in\nfighting a holy war.\nUpon learning of the defendant’s communications with\nIndividual #1, and discovering that the defendant had lost\ncontact with Individual #1 for a period of time, the government\nintroduced a cooperating source (“CS”) to the defendant through\nonline communications in order to determine whether the defendant\nremained intent on supporting terrorism and joining a foreign\nfighter group abroad.  Through the use of the CS, the government\nlearned that the defendant was continuing to make efforts to\nsupport international terrorism, and in fact was pursuing his\nplans to travel from the United States to the Middle East and\nultimately make his way to the FATA to join a foreign fighter\ngroup.\nOn September 6, 2011, JTTF agents arrested the\ndefendant at John F. Kennedy International Airport (“JFK”) in\nQueens, New York, from where he was about to travel to Turkey en\nroute to Pakistan.  (PSR ¶ 4).  Following his arrest, the\ndefendant made statements to agents regarding his offense\nconduct.1  On September 8, 2011, a grand jury in this District\nreturned an indictment charging the defendant with one count of\nproviding material support to terrorists, in violation of 18\nU.S.C. § 2339A(a).  On January 26, 2012, the grand jury returned\na superseding indictment, which including three additional counts\nof providing and attempting to provide materials support,\nconsisting principally of money (some of which was to be used for\nweapons) and personnel.  On April 12, 2012, following discovery\ndisclosures and plea negotiations, the defendant pled guilty to\nCount Two of the superseding indictment.  (PSR ¶ 1).\n1  The government offers copies of the defendant’s post\narrest statements as Exhibit A, and respectfully requests that\nthey be filed under seal because the statements relate to ongoing\ninvestigations.  See United States v. Doe, 63 F.3d 121, 128 (2d\nCir. 1995); United States v. Haller, 837 F.2d 84, 87 (2d Cir.\n1988).  In the event that the Court denies the government’s\nmotion to seal Exhibit A, the government would respectfully\nwithdraw the exhibit to avoid public disclosure.  \n2\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-JG   Document 39   Filed 11/21/12   Page 3 of 11 PageID #: 267\nDuring his plea allocution, the defendant stated:\nBetween April 1, 2011 and September 6, 2011,\nI tried to help a group of people who I\nbelieved were engaged in fighting in\nPakistan.  I agreed with the group and\nattempted to help the group by providing\nmoney, and myself, in support of their\nefforts.  I obtained an Iranian visa and, on\nSeptember 6, 2011, I went to JFK in Queens,\nNew York in an effort to travel to [sic]\nMiddle East in an effort to join the group.\n(Plea Tr. 18-19).  In addition, at the plea proceeding, the Court\ninformed the parties that the Court would reserve decision as to\nwhether to accept the plea, and directed the parties to address\nGuidelines Section 6B1.2.\nWith respect to the defendant’s offense conduct, the\nparties stipulated to a joint proposed amendment to the PSR, a\ncopy of which has been previously provided to the Court.  In sum,\nthe parties agreed that the defendant sent money to, and\nattempted to join, a group of people whom he believed were\nengaged in fighting in the FATA.\nII.  Applicable Law\nA. Acceptance of the Guilty Plea\nRule 11(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure directs that where a defendant “pleads guilty . . . to\n. . . a charged offense” pursuant to a plea agreement specifying\nthat “an attorney for the government . . . will move to dismiss\nother charges,” then “the court may accept the agreement, reject\nit, or defer a decision until the court has reviewed the\npresentence report.”  Section 6B1.1(c) of the United States\nSentencing Guidelines repeats the language of Rule 11(c)(3)(A). \nSection 6B1.2 sets forth the standards for acceptance\nof plea agreements under the Guidelines.  As pertinent here,\nSection 6B1.2(a) specifies that “the court may accept the\nagreement if the court determines, for reasons stated on the\nrecord, that the remaining charges adequately reflect the\nseriousness of the actual offense behavior and that accepting the\nagreement will not undermine the statutory purposes of sentencing\nor the sentencing Guidelines.”  Whether to accept a plea\nagreement rests within the Court’s discretion.  See United States\nv. Severino, 800 F.2d 42, 45 (2d Cir. 1986); United States v.\n3\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-JG   Document 39   Filed 11/21/12   Page 4 of 11 PageID #: 268\nTorres-Echavarria, 129 F.3d 692, 696 (2d Cir. 1997); see also\nFed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(3)(A) Advisory Committee Notes (“The plea\nagreement procedure does not attempt to define criteria for the\nacceptance or rejection of a plea agreement.  Such a decision is\nleft to the discretion of the individual trial judge.”). \nB. Imposition of Sentence\nIt is settled law that “a district court should begin\nall sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the\napplicable Guidelines range.  As a matter of administration and\nto secure nationwide consistency, the Guidelines should be the\nstarting point and the initial benchmark.”  Gall v. United\nStates, 552 U.S. 38, 49 (2007) (citation omitted).  Next, a\nsentencing court should “consider all of the § 3553(a) factors to\ndetermine whether they support the sentence requested by a party. \nIn so doing, [it] may not presume that the Guidelines range is\nreasonable. [It] must make an individualized assessment based on\nthe facts presented.”  Id. at 50 (citation and footnote omitted). \nTitle 18, United States Code, Section 3553(a) provides,\nin part, that a sentencing Court shall consider:\n(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the \nhistory and characteristics of the defendant; [and]\n(2) the need for the sentence imposed-- \n(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to \npromote respect for the law, and to provide just \npunishment for the offense;\n(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;\n(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the\ndefendant; and \n(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or\nvocational training, medical care, or other\ncorrectional treatment in the most effective manner.\nThus, the Court must first calculate the applicable Guidelines\nrange, and then apply the 3553(a) factors to arrive at an\nappropriate sentence.  Notably, “district courts must begin their\nanalysis with the Guidelines and remain cognizant of them\nthroughout the sentencing process.”  Gall, 552 U.S. at 50 n.6.  \n4\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-JG   Document 39   Filed 11/21/12   Page 5 of 11 PageID #: 269\nC. Application of the Terrorism Enhancement\nSection 3A1.4 of the Sentencing Guidelines applies\nwhere “the offense is a felony that involved, or was intended to\npromote, a federal crime of terrorism,” as defined in 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2332b(g)(5).  U.S.S.G. § 3A1.4 & comment n. 1.  Section\n2332b(g)(5), in turn, provides that:\n[T]he term “Federal crime of terrorism’ means\nan offense that -\n(A) is calculated to influence or affect the\nconduct of government by intimidation or\ncoercion, or to retaliate against government\nconduct; and\n(B) is a violation of [one of certain\nenumerated statutes].\n18 U.S.C.  § 2332b(g)(5).  The Second Circuit has held that by\nrequiring that the underlying crime “be calculated to influence\nor affect . . . or to retaliate against government conduct,” the\nstatute does not require “proof of a defendant’s particular\nmotive.”  United States v. Awan, 607 F.3d 306, 317 (2d. Cir.\n2010).  “[A] person may intend and may commit an offense that is\nso calculated even if influencing or retaliating against\ngovernment is not his personal motivation.”  Id.  By way of\nexample, “a person who murders a head of state” commits an act of\nterrorism if he knows “that his crime will influence or affect\nthe conduct of government . . . even if his particular motivation\nin committing the murder is to impress a more established\nterrorist with his abilities.”  Id. (emphasis in original).  In\nthis case, the offense of conviction - Count Two - charged a\nviolation enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5)(b).\n \nIII. Guidelines Calculation\nAs set forth in the PSR, the defendant’s total adjusted\noffense level for Count Two is 42.  (PSR ¶¶ 7-15).  The\nGuidelines for Count Two are calculated as follows:\n  Base Offense Level: (2X2.1)  33\nPlus: Terrorism Enhancement (3A1.4(a))   +12\nLess: Acceptance of Responsibility (3E1.1) - 3\nAdjusted Offense Level:                 42\n5\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-JG   Document 39   Filed 11/21/12   Page 6 of 11 PageID #: 270\nAdditionally, while the defendant has no known criminal record,\npursuant to the application of the terrorism enhancement in\nSection 3A1.4(b), the defendant’s criminal history category is\nVI.  Category VI provides for an applicable advisory Guidelines\nsentence of 360 months to life imprisonment.  However, because\nCount Two carries a statutory maximum sentence of fifteen years,\nthe defendant’s effective Guidelines range of imprisonment is 180\nmonths.  (PSR ¶ 41).\nIV. The Court Should Accept the Defendant’s Plea Because it\nReflects a Reasonable Exercise of Prosecutorial Discretion\nOn April 12, 2012, pursuant to a plea agreement with\nthe government and in satisfaction of a four-count superseding\nindictment, the defendant pled guilty to one count of attempted\nmaterial support for terrorists, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2339A.  PSR ¶ 1.  During the guilty plea proceeding, the Court\ndirected the parties to address at sentencing whether it should\naccept the plea agreement pursuant to Rule 11(c)(3)(A) and\nSection 6B1.1(c).\nAs discussed above, both Rule 11(c)(3)(A) and Section\n6B1.1(c) direct that, where a defendant pleads guilty pursuant to\na plea agreement specifying that the government “will move to\ndismiss other charges,” “the court may accept the agreement,\nreject it, or defer a decision until the court has reviewed the\npresentence report.”  Section 6B1.2 sets forth the factors\ngoverning the Court’s decision:  \nthe court may accept the agreement if the\ncourt determines, for reasons stated on the\nrecord, that the remaining charges adequately\nreflect the seriousness of the actual offense\nbehavior and that accepting the agreement\nwill not undermine the statutory purposes of\nsentencing or the sentencing Guidelines.\nU.S.S.G. § 6B1.2.  Whether to accept a plea agreement pursuant to\nthe above standards rests within the Court’s discretion. \nSeverino, 800 F.2d at 45; Torres-Echavarria, 129 F.3d at 696;\nFed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(3)(A) Advisory Committee Notes.   \nThe Court should accept the plea agreement because the\nnegotiated disposition appropriately balances the seriousness of\nthe defendant’s conduct against the significant prosecutorial\nrisks and burdens avoided through a negotiated resolution, and\npermits careful allocation of prosecutorial and other\ngovernmental resources that would otherwise be devoted to\n6\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-JG   Document 39   Filed 11/21/12   Page 7 of 11 PageID #: 271\npretrial and trial litigation.  On one hand, as discussed further\nbelow, the defendant’s crimes were profoundly serious: he sent\nsignificant sums of money in support of terrorist activities\naimed at American servicemen abroad, and he himself attempted to\ntravel abroad with the intent to join a jihadist fighting group. \nHe posed a real danger to American lives and interests overseas,\nand accordingly deserves a very serious sentence.\nOn the other hand, had the government and the defendant\nnot reached a plea agreement, the government would have been\nfaced with the risk of trial, which in all cases includes the\npossibility of adverse verdicts on one or more counts of the\nindictment.  Moreover, had the defendant elected to proceed to\ntrial, or to exercise all of his pretrial litigation options, the\ngovernment would likely have been required to engage in\nsubstantial litigation, including at a minimum a motion to\nsuppress evidence obtained or derived pursuant to the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Act, see 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801 et seq.; a\nmotion to suppress the defendant’s post-arrest statements; and\none or more motions for protective orders pursuant to the\nClassified Information Procedures Act, see 18 U.S.C. App. III\n§ 4.  As the Court is aware, such litigation can be unusually\nburdensome even in the most straightforward of cases, and can\npose exceptional burdens where complex issues are present.  Nor\ndo such burdens fall solely on the Department of Justice and the\ninvestigating agencies associated with the JTTF.  Rather, the\nresponsibility to protect against undue disclosure of classified\ninformation requires coordination with other government agencies;\nthe relevant agency or agencies must in such cases devote\nsubstantial effort to analyzing and describing potential risks\nand setting forth that analysis for the Court.  Indeed, pursuant\nto Second Circuit law, any declaration seeking to assert the\nprivilege against the disclosure of classified information must\nbe accompanied by a personal declaration by the “head” of the\nrelevant agency.  See United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 78-80\n(2d Cir. 2008).\nPlainly, such declarations must be produced, and such\nmotions must be litigated, where necessary in the appropriate\ncase.  Equally plainly, where the government can secure a\nsubstantial sentence that adequately reflects the Section 3553(a)\nfactors without causing additional burdens on its counter-\nterrorism apparatus, it is in the national security interest of\nthe United States to do so.  In the judgment of the government,\nthe mutual concessions in the plea agreement in this case\naccomplish those twin aims by providing the sentencing court with\nthe opportunity to impose a reasonable sentence in light of the\ndefendant’s acceptance of responsibility, and by permitting the\n7\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-JG   Document 39   Filed 11/21/12   Page 8 of 11 PageID #: 272\ngovernment to focus its resources on additional offenders and\nadditional threats.  See generally United States Attorney’s\nManual § 9-27.420.\nSuch interests have long been recognized as appropriate\nbases for the exercise of prosecutorial discretion: \nThis broad discretion rests largely on the\nrecognition that the decision to prosecute is\nparticularly ill-suited to judicial review. \nSuch factors as the strength of the case, the\nprosecution’s general deterrence value, the\nGovernment’s enforcement priorities, and the\ncase’s relationship to the Government’s\noverall enforcement plan are not readily\nsusceptible to the kind of analysis the\ncourts are competent to undertake.  Judicial\nsupervision in this area, moreover, entails\nsystemic costs of particular concern.\nWayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 607 (1985).  As this Court\nhas noted, “Although the Supreme Court used that language in\naddressing the decision whether to prosecute, it is equally\napplicable . . . to whether an arguably reasonable sentence\nbargain is appropriate.”  Hon. John Gleeson, Idea: the Sentencing\nCommission and Prosecutorial Discretion: the Role of the\nCourts in Policing Sentence Bargains, 36 Hofstra Law Review 639,\n656 n.68 (2008).  While this case does not involve sentence\nbargaining, the Supreme Court’s reasoning applies where a plea\nbargain effectively limits the defendant’s sentence to the\nstatutory maximum prison term.\nBalanced against the above prosecutorial interests, a\nsentence at the statutory maximum of fifteen years will\n“adequately reflect the seriousness of the actual offense\nbehavior” and “not undermine the statutory purposes of sentencing\nor the sentencing Guidelines.”  As set forth below, the plea\nagreement preserves the Court’s authority to impose a significant\nsentence that serves the statutory interests of sentencing. \nWhile the superseding indictment included additional substantive\ncounts of providing and attempting to provide material support to\nterrorists, in that the defendant sent money overseas on separate\noccasions, and also sought to join a group of foreign fighters,\nthe counts were related to a common scheme, and the scheme to\ntravel abroad never progressed past the airport.  Under all of\nthe foregoing circumstances, the Court should accept the plea\nagreement.\n8\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-JG   Document 39   Filed 11/21/12   Page 9 of 11 PageID #: 273\nV. Sentencing Analysis\nA. The Probation Department Accurately Calculated the\nApplicable Advisory Guidelines Range              \nThe PSR appropriately applied the terrorism enhancement\nset forth in § 3A1.4.  As noted above, the offense of conviction,\n18 U.S.C. § 2339A(a), is among the crimes listed in 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2332(g)(5)(B), and the crimes supported by the defendant –\njihadist fighting against the American, Pakistani, or allied\nforces in Afghanistan and the FATA, were squarely among those\n“calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by\nintimidation or coercion,” id. § 2332(g)(5)(A).  Accordingly, his\napplicable advisory Guidelines term of imprisonment is the\nstatutory maximum sentence of 180 months’ imprisonment.\nB.   The Statutory Maximum Appropriately Accounts for the\nSignificance of the Defendant’s Criminal Conduct in the\nContext of the Guilty Plea, which Spared the Government\nSignificant Litigation Risks and Burdens               \nThe Sentencing Guidelines treat terrorism offenses\nseverely and thus provide an appropriate touchstone from which to\nbegin the 3553(a) analysis.  As the Second Circuit noted in 2010,\n“the Guidelines signal that any crime promoting terrorism is to\nbe viewed as extremely serious.”  United States v. Stewart, 597\nF.3d at 521 (2d Cir. 2010).  Likewise, “the strong need to deter\nterrorism is evident from the Guidelines recommendation that a\nterrorism defendant be accorded a criminal history of VI, the\nhighest level possible, without regard to [a defendant’s] actual\ncriminal record.”  Id.\nUnder the circumstances presented here, as set forth\nabove with respect to the 6B1.2 analysis, where the defendant’s\nplea of guilty spared the government the risks and burdens\nassociated with prosecuting a case involving classified\ninformation, and that was likely to consume the time and\nattention of JTTF investigators whose primary duties are\nprotecting national security through the prevention and\ninvestigation of other crimes of terrorism, a sentence at the\nstatutory maximum of fifteen years’ imprisonment is not\nunreasonable.\nC.  The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense Weigh in   \nFavor of a Sentence of Fifteen Years                \n      \nAlthough certainly not dispositive, it is not wholly\nirrelevant that the defendant in this case was only able to send\n9\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-JG   Document 39   Filed 11/21/12   Page 10 of 11 PageID #: 274\napproximately $1,000 overseas, and that his attempt to join a\nterrorist organization was disrupted well before he even left the\nUnited States.  Nor does this case present as an aggravating\nfactor proof of actual harm to victims; rather, the government\ndoes not argue that the defendant’s conduct contributed to any\nactual harm overseas.  See United States v. Stewart, 590 F.3d 93,\n175 (2d Cir. 2009) (Walker, J., dissenting) (“Congress has been\nunmistakably clear that, as a general matter, the achievement of\nactual harm may aggravate the seriousness of a terrorism crime\nbut that the absence of proven harm does not mitigate such a\ncrime.).  The nature and seriousness of the defendant’s attempt\nto support a terrorist conspiracy to commit murder in a foreign\ncountry weighs strongly in favor of a sentence at the statutory\nmaximum of fifteen years in this case, but do not, given the\ndefendant’s acceptance of responsibility, demand a sentence of\nlife imprisonment.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1) and (a)(2)(A). \nD.  A Sentence at the Statutory Maximum Would \nReflect the Seriousness of the Offenses, Promote \nRespect for the Law, and Provide Just Punishment\nThere are few more serious offenses in the federal\ncriminal code than attempting to support a crime of terrorism.  A\nsentence at the statutory maximum of fifteen years would reflect\nthe seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law and\nprovide just punishment for the defendant’s criminal conduct,\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A).\nE.  The Deterrence Factor Weighs Heavily in Favor of a\nSentence at the Statutory Maximum                 \nDeterrence is a key factor in the Court’s assessment of\nthe appropriateness of the defendant’s sentence.  A sentence of\nfifteen years in this case would appropriately send a message to\nthe community at large that the United States does not tolerate\nsuch abhorrent criminal conduct.  Given the compelling need to\ndeter the continued threat that home-grown terrorists like the\ndefendant pose to the United States and our allies abroad, a\nsentence at the statutory maximum would send a clear message to\nany would-be jihadists that such conduct carries substantial\nconsequences.\nF.  Protecting the Public Requires a Sentence at the\nStatutory Maximum                               \nThe evidence adduced during the investigation clearly\nreflects the risk posed by the defendant.  From the start of his\ncriminal venture, the defendant consistently pressed onward to\n10\n\nCase 1:11-cr-00623-JG   Document 39   Filed 11/21/12   Page 11 of 11 PageID #: 275\nhis goal of supporting and even personally joining a terrorist\ngroup.  Because the defendant is a serious potential danger to\nthe community, only extraordinary incapacitation will protect the\npublic from his return to violent jihad.\nVI. Conclusion\nFor the reasons set forth above, the government\nrespectfully requests that the Court accept the defendant’s plea\nand impose a sentence of fifteen years’ imprisonment.\nRespectfully submitted,\nLORETTA E.

(Piper, \nFrancine) (Entered: 10/23/2013) \n10/23/2013     ORDER as to Agron Hasbajrami re 57 Letter. The defendant was \nsentenced on January 8, 2013 on his plea of guilty to attempting to \n\nprovide material support to terrorists. He has not filed a notice of \nappeal. I have received a letter dated October 4, 2013 from the \ndefendant demanding certain discovery, including grand jury \ntranscripts, the \"criminal complain[t]\" and other documents.The \ndefendant's plea of guilty has extinguished his right to the discovery he \nseeks. A couple of the requested documents -- the docket sheet and the \ntranscript of the sentencing proceeding -- are readily obtainable and \nought in fairness to be provided to him, but I see neither an entitlement \nto the others or a justification for directing the government to provide \nthem. Accordingly, the government is ordered to send a copy of the \ndocket sheet and the sentencing transcript to Hasbajrami on or before \nNovember 1, 2013 and to file a letter confirming its compliance with \nthat order by that date. Otherwise, the request for discovery is denied. \nOrdered by Judge John Gleeson on 10/23/2013.

(Piper, \nFrancine) (Entered: 12/03/2013) \n12/03/2013     ORDER as to Agron Hasbajrami. The Court has received Mr. \nHasbajrami's November 20, 2013, letter, docketed as 60 . However, as \nevidenced by the docket sheet, the Court never received a copy of the \nmotion to vacate sentence referred to in the letter. Without expressing \nany view on whether Mr. Hasbajrami did in fact submit the motion \npreviously, the Court invites Mr. Hasbajrami to submit the motion \nagain. However, he is reminded that federal law enforces time limits on \nmotions to attack a conviction or sentence, so the Court encourages him \nto proceed expeditiously.

In light of the government's \nsubmission of Mr. Hasbajrami's July application 61 , the Court's \n12/3/13 order directing Hasbajrami to refile any such application is \nmoot. Instead, the Court will construe the attachment as a motion under \n28 U.S.C. § 2255 and direct the Clerk to open a new civil case as a \ncollateral attack on Hasbajrami's conviction or sentence.
