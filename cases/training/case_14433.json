    "summary": "<p>As discussed in detail in <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14247\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In re Various Known and Unknown Agents of [Redacted]</a>, the Protect America Act (PAA) was passed in 2007 in order to avoid compliance with the FISA Court's interpretation of traditional FISA. The PAA amended FISA in two important ways. First, it allowed warrantless collection of international communications to or from the U.S. from facilities inside the U.S. Second, it allowed warrantless collection of foreign to foreign communications from facilities inside the U.S.</p>\r\n<p>This is the first case in which the FISA Court reviewed the government's procedures for authorizing surveillance under the PAA. In order to authorize surveillance, the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) had to carry out two statutory requirements. First, they had to determine that there were reasonable procedures in place for ensuring that the surveillance to be undertaken concerned people located outside of the U.S. Second, they had to determine that the acquisition in question did not constitute electronic surveillance as defined by FISA and the PAA. The PAA changed FISA by exempting surveillance of people reasonably believed to located outside the U.S. from FISA's definition of electronic surveillance. Therefore, to meet the second requirement of the PAA, the AG and the DNI had to reasonably believe that a target of surveillance was located outside of the U.S.</p>\r\n<p>The PAA also included provisions for FISA Court review of the government's authorizations of surveillance for compliance with the statute. The statute required the government to submit their procedures for determining that the surveillance concerned people outside the U.S. and did not constitute electronic surveillance. The statutory standard of review was for clear error, and review was narrowly confined to whether the procedures proposed by the government met the statutory requirements.</p>\r\n<p>In an order dated October 11, 2007, the FISA Court (Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly) asked the government to supplement its procedures submitted to the Court under seal (the Court references a surveillance certification filed on August 10, 2007 and a corresponding set of procedures filed on August 17, 2007; neither of these documents appear to have been declassified or otherwise made public as of April 2015) by answering several questions regarding the adequacy of the procedures at protecting against the acquisition and retention of protected communications of U.S. persons.</p>\r\n<p>The government responded to the Court's order with answers in a document dated October 26, 2007, and the Court issued a new order approving the use of the procedures as explained by the government's response on January 15, 2008.</p>\r\n<p>The PAA raised considerable concerns that surveillance of some wholly domestic communications would now be outside of traditional FISA. This happened because the PAA broadly defined \"person\" to include not only individuals, but also groups, entities, associations, corporations, or foreign powers. The worry was that a group like Al Qaeda could reasonably believed to be located abroad, but Al Qaeda related communications could take place wholly within the U.S., and the PAA's broad definitions would allow for such communications to be collected without the probable cause determinations and warrant requirements of traditional FISA. While the government strenuously denied that the PAA would be interpreted to allow such surveillance in practice, the PAA was allowed to sunset in 2008, and was replaced by the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 (FAA) (amending 50 U.S.C. &sect; 1801 et seq.).</p>\r\n<p>The analogous certification matter in 2008, under the FAA, is described in <a href=\"../../../../case/14411/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">[In re DNI/AG 702(i) Certification 2008].</a></p>",

Statutory Framework \nIn this matter, a judge of the FISC is for the first time exercising a responsibility assigned to \nit by the Protect America Act of2007, Pub. L. No. 110y55, 121 Stat. 552 (P ..O  ...A.).  The PAA. created \na new framework, within the Foreign Ll'ltelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, codified as amended at \n50 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1871 (FISA), under which the Executive Branch, pursuant to a \"certification\" by \nthe Attorney General and the DNl, may conduct certain forms offoreign intelligence colJection, and \n~ \ndirect third parties to assist in such collection. \nThe PA.A.. accomplished this in several steps.  First, the PAA provided that F1SA's definition \nI \nof electronic swveil1ai1Ce, at 50 U .S.C. § l 801 (f), shall not be \"consLrued to encompass surveillance \ndirected at a person reasonably believed to be located outside of the United States.':  50 U.S.C. \n§ 180Sa.1 \n1  Prior to the PA  A, the government had argued to the FISC that, in some contexts, \nsurveillances of targets outside of the United States did constirute electronic surveilla11ce as defined \nby FISA, such that the FISC had jurisdiction. The  uded that  did \n'urisdict1on over certain  of such surveillances \nthe request of the government, FISC judges have entertained  for authority \nto conduct such surveillances.  Since the enactment of r...'1e PA  .A., the goverrunent has opted, pursuant \nto the \"transition procedures\" of the P AA, to continue to submit applications to the F1SC for \nauthority to conduct such sui-veilla..-1ces, \"under the provisions of [FISA] as in effect\" prior to the \neffective date of the P.A...A.

In order to grant such an authorization, the DNI and the Attorney \nGeneral must make several specified determinations.  Most pertinentb', iliey must determine that \n(1) there are reasonable procedures in place for determining that the acquisition of \nforeign intelligence information ... concerns persons reasonably belie-ved to be \nlocated outside the United States, and such procedures will be subject to review of \nthe Court pursuant to [50 U.S.C. § 1805c; and] \n(2) the acquisi1:ion does not constitute elecrronic survei1lance .... \nld.1  These determinations \"shall be in the fonn of a vvritten certification, under oath.\"  § 1 805b(a). \nThe Attorney General and the DNI may direct a person to assist in acquisitions pursuant to such a \ncertification.  § 1805b( e). \nThird, the PAl\\ provides for judicial rev1ew of certain aspects of the certificat)on process. \nThe government is required to ''transmit\" to the FISC copies of each certi.tlcation, § 1805b(a), and to \n2  The pre-PAA. version ofFlSA provided a means for u':le Attorney Genera) to authorize \nsome forms of electronic surveillance, without bene:fit of a court order, by making a different type of \n''certification.\"  50 U.S. C. § 1802(a).  Section 1802( a), which the P A.A. did not aJter, is available \nonly in narrowly draVvTl circumstances- when the surveiHance is \"solely directed\" at cenain types of \nforeign powers (not including groups engaged in international terrorism) and \"there is no substantial \nlikelihood\" that any U.S. person's conununications will be acquired.  § 1802(a)(l)(A) & (B). \nAhhough copies of such certif1cations are fi1ed with the FISC under§ 1802(a)(3), the FISC has no \nrole in reviewing them. \n. \n3  The other required elements of the cen:ificati on invoive assistance from a third oartv who \n.

The \ncourt's review shall be limited to whether the Government's dete~inru:ion is clearly erroneous.\" \n§ 1805c(b). \nIf the court concludes that the determination is not clearly erroneous, it shall enter an \norder approving ilie continued use of such procedures.  If t.1e court concludes that the \ndetermination is clearly erroneous, it shall issue an order directing the GDve:rr.ment to \nsubmit new procedures within 30 days or cease any acquisitions under section 1805b \nof this title that are implicated.by the court's order. \n§ 1805c(c).4 \nTirree points about the FISC's role under § 1805c bear emphasis. 5  First, t.1e FISC is to apply \na \"clearly erroneous\" standard of review.  To apply tbs standard properly, the FISC looks to how a \n\"clearly erroneous\" standard of review is understood in other contexts.6  Vlhen an appellate court is \n4  The PA.. ...' \\ also provides a role for the FISC regarding directives issued pursuant to \n§ 1805b(e): under § 1805b(h), the recipient of such a directive may file a petition with the FISC \nchallenging its legality; and under § 1805b(g), the government \"'may invoke the aid\" of the FISC \"to \ncompel compliance\" wiih a directive. \n5  In a separate, adversarial proceeding before another judge of this Court under § 1805b(g), \nthe respondent has argued that the PA.!\\ is unconstitutional because it violates the Fourth \nAmendment and separation-of-powers principles.  See Docket No. 105B(G) 07-01. 1n the instant, \nex parte proceeding under § 1805c, the Court addresses only tb.ose issues commended to ·it by \n§ 1805c, and does not reacb those constitutional issues. \n6  See Brad1ev v.

Executive branch \ndeterminations under§ 1805b(a)(4) & (a)(S) regarding the purpose ofthe acquisition and the \nadequacy of minimizarion procedures are not subject to review under § 1805c.  l'ior, under § 1805c, \ndoes the Coun make any assessment of probable cause, as it does pursuant to §§ 1805(a)(3) anq \n1824(a)(3) before issuing orders authorizing electronic surveillance a..i1d physical .search. \nTIJ.ird, the statute describes the subject matter of the Court's review under § 1805c using \nvarying and ambiguous language.

But NSA is not targeting the comml.lillcations of those other persons for general \nacquisition; rather, those persons come within the scope of the stirveillance only when they are \ncommunicating with the users of the tasked facilities _IS  ln the plain meaning of the term, this form \nof surveillance is ''directed\" at the users of the tasked facilities, a.1'1d not at other persons. lo \n14  NSA also acquires another category of electronic communications, which is discussed in \nPart III.D infra. \n15  United States persons whose communications are acquired will be afforded the protection \nofFISA minimization procedures.

It \ncould be argued that these acquisitions also ·'concern\" persons who communicate with the users of \nthe tasked facilities, and even third parties who are mentioned in such conununications.  However, \nthere are sound reasons for concluding that the second prong is still satisfied.  Section 1805b(a)(l ), \nby its terms, does not require that the acquisition of foreign intelligence information exclusivelv \nconcern persons reasonably believed to be outside of the .United States.  Moreover, so stringent a \nreading would put § 1805b(a)(l) at odds with§ 1805a, which focuses on the location of persons at \nwhom the surveillance i~ \"directed,\" not a1 u'le broader class of persons whose commuruca:tions or \nirJonnation are acquired by the surveillance.  Therefoie, § 1805b(a)(1) should be interpreted in a \nmanner that harmonizes its requirements Vvith those of§§ 1805a and 1805c(b).  See Food & Drug \nAdmin. v.

The Court adopts this interpretation in its \nreview of Vlhether the procedures are clearly erroneous. \nThus, for the form ofNSA surveillance that acquires communications that are to or from the \ntasked facilities, both prongs of the tvvo-pan formulation stated on page 8 suora will be satisfied if \nthe procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that the users of the tasked facilities are reasonably \nbelieved to be outside of the United States. \nTne Court finds, under the applicable \"clearly erroneous\" standard, that the procedures as \ngenerally summarized in Part Ill.A. suora are reasonably designed to ensure that the users of tasked \nfacilities are reasonably believed to be located outside of u\\e United States.  V../hlle the procedures \nleave it to the discretion ofNSA analysts exactly which steps are appropriate to take prior to tasking \na particular phone number or e-mail account, analysts are required to ma.lce a record of the basis for \ntheir assessment that the user is outside of the United States.

First, there is reason to believe that such communications \nconcern the users of the tasked e-mail accounts that are referenced in the communications, and those \nusers are reasonably believed to be outside of u~e United States.  Second, there is reason to believe \nthat at least one party to an acquired communication is outside of the United States, such that the \ncommunication will \"concern\" that party also.  In addition to these persons reasonably believed to \nbe outside of the UrJted States, the acquired communications might also \"concern\" other persons, \nincluding some persons in the United States.  This fact, however, is not fatalto the procedures, \nbecause an acquisition may properly concern a person in the United States, provided that it also \nconcerns one or more persons reasonably believed w be outside of the United States, under the \ninterpretation adopted by the Court to hannonize § 1805b(a)(l) with §§ 1805a and 1805c(b).

Accordingly, the Court finds, under the applicable \"clearly erroneous\" standard, \nthat the second prong of this formulation, relating to tbe requirements of § 18 05 b( a)(1 ), is satisfied. \nUnder the fii\"st prong of the formulatjon, the analysis is not as simple, because it kss clear at \nwhom this form of surveillance is :'directed.\"  In one sense, NSA directs the surveillance by tasking \nparticular e-mail accounts for acquisition, and as .a iesult of that tasking only communications that \nare to, from or \"about\" a tasked e-mail account are acquired.

Because there is reason \nto believe that both classes of persons are outside of the United States, the Court finds, under the \nTOP SEoCRETHCOP.HNTHORCON,~iOFQR\"\\ii/Xl \nPage 21 \n577 \n\n(cid:38)(cid:53)(cid:3)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:25)(cid:20)\nApproved for public release by the DNI 20140909\nTOP SECR:ETHCOI\\HNTI/O\"RCO~;NOFORNN:Xl \n••cJearly erroneous\" standard applicable under § 1805c, that the fust prong of the formulation stated \non page 8 supra is satisfied.  The Coun expresses no opinion ·on whether such a finding could be \nmade for procedures that did not provide reason to believe that both the user of the tasked e-mail \naccounts and at least one parry to the acquired comrn.unications are outside of the United States. \nE.  Emerg:encv Deoarture Provision \nThe procedures state: \nIf, in order to protect against an immediate threat to the national security, the NSA \ndetermines that it must take action in apparent departure from these procedures and \ntbat it is not feasible to. obtain a timely modification of these procedures from t1e \nAttorney General and Director of National Intelligence, NSA may take such action \nand shall report that activity promptly to (the Department of Justice and the Office of \nthe DNl]. \nAs of the hearing on December 12, this departure provision had not been invoked.  Trans. at \n28.  By the tenns of this provision, any requirement of the procedures could be the subject of a \n''departure. \"20  However, t'le government has explained that it anticipates that an emergency \ndeparture might be invoked in one ofthree contexts: \n20  Even in emergency circumstances, though, NSA \"would continue to adhere to the \nstatut9ry limitation that it could only direct surveiilance at a target reasonably believed to be located \noutside of the United States.\"  Gov 't Response at 2. \nTO~ ~ECRET/ICOMJNTI/ORCON,1'(0FOR1•WX1 \nPage 22 \n578 \n\n(cid:38)(cid:53)(cid:3)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:25)(cid:21)\nApproved for public release by the DNI 20140909\nTOP SECRE'fh'COI\\IttNT/J'OftCOM;l'CfOFOltN//Xl \nThe government intends that NSA's prompt notification of the activity conducted pursuant \nto an emergency depanure would be in l'lriting (either initially or following an oral notification), \nsuch that the propriery of such activity could be assessed in future reviews. Id. at 40.  The departure \nfrom the procedures would be only as broad as necessary to respond to the immediate threat to \nnational securiiJ, id. at 33-34, and would terminate once the immediate threat had receded.  Id. at \n36-37. If the government concluded that a broader or longer-lasting modification oflhe procedures \nwas appropriate, it would revise the procedures accordingly and submit the revision to the FISC for \nreview under§ 1805c. ld. at 56-57. \nThe Court recognizes that it is difficult to anticipate in advance what steps would be most \n·efficacious in responding to an emergency.  The government has determined that a delegation to \nNSA of authority to depart from the procedures temporarily, when necessary to respond to an \nimmediate threat to national security, and only when modification by the Anorney General and the \nDNI cruu1ot be timely obtained, is a reasonable means of responding to emergencies. NSA is \nrequired to report such activity promptly to the Attorney General and the D'Nl, who may w.1en take \nappropriate action if they do not believe that the deparrure is justified.

Conclusion \nFor the reasons stated herein, the Court finds, in the language of 50 U.S.C. § 1805c(b) and \nconsistent with the Court's interpretation of that provision in view of 50 U.S. C. §§ 1805b(a)(l) and \n. 1805a, that the Goverrunent's determination  under 50 U.S.C. § 1805b(a)(1) that the-\n.acquisitions conducted pursuant to [§ 1805b] do not constitu~:e electronic surveillance\" is not \n\"clearly erroneous.\"  Accordingly, pursuant to§ 1805c(c), it is hereby ORDERED that the \ncontinued use of such procedures is approved . \n.-(b \nENTERED this /5_ day of January, 2008, regarding \nJudge, United States Foreign \nIntelligence  Surveillance Court \n'fOP SECRE'fHCOI'rflNTh'ORCON,~iOFORN//Xl \nPage 24 \n580 ",
