Wilson: The Court ORDERS as follows: Plaintiffs alternative proposals to expand the classwide issues to include inmates experiences of verbal abuse or to define a subclass of inmates who were esposed to verbal abuse are DENIED for the reasons expressed in the Courts order of March 12, 2014. (See Dkt 232: Order at 11-13.) Membership in such a subclass (or in an expanded class encompassing these allegations) would not be reasonably ascertainable in view of the difficulty of defining what constitutes abusive language and the significant variation in deputies behavior. See Keegan v. American Honda Motor Co., 284 F.R.D. 504, 521 (C.D. Cal. 2012). However, the Court DEFERS ruling on whether subclasses should be certified for inmates who experienced unsanitary conditions, extreme weather conditions, or inadequate privacy protection. The parties shall file supplemental briefs. (SEE ORDER FOR DETAILS.) Plaintiffs shall file a supplemental brief of no more than 25 pages addressing the foregoing questions not later than August 4, 2014. Defendants shall file a responsive brief of no more than 25 pages not more than 14 days after plaintiffs brief. Plaintiffs may file a reply of no more than 15 pages within 7 days of the filing of defendants brief. The parties shall appear for a further hearing on this matter on Monday, September 8, 2014, at 1:30 p.m. The Court concludes that further briefing on the question of whether certification of a damages class on the issue of liability pursuant to Rules 23(b)(3) and 23(c)(4) would be superior to individual lawsuits should await answers to the foregoing questions. The Court DEFERS ruling on defendants evidentiary objections to plaintiffs renewed motion 249 . (kss) (Entered: 07/17/2014)"

On review, it appears that the Supreme Court's decision in Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington, et al., No. 10-945, which is currently pending before the Supreme Court, potentially could affect the viability of Bull and its application to this case. Accordingly, the Court believes that in the interests of judicial efficiency, this case should be stayed pending the Supreme Court's decision in Florence. If any party disagrees with the Court's assessment, that party is hereby ORDERED to file a supplemental brief with the Court, of no more than five (5) pages in length, within ten (10) days of the date of this order.

Intervention as of right requires an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action. Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2). Moreover, an intervenor must have Article III standing to seek separate relief, see Town of Chester v. Laroe Estates, Inc., 137 S. Ct. 1645, 1651 (2017), or to litigate independently in the absence of the party on whose side intervention is sought, see Diamond v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54, 68 (1986). As the Court explained in its prior Order, because Shorter has opted out, she no longer has an interest in or standing to litigate in this case. Dkt. 473. Finally, Shorter admits that she became aware of the settlement on July 28, 2019, Dkt. 476, at 11, and Shorters considerable delay and potential disruption to the settlement both make permissive intervention inappropriate, Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(3). The hearing is vacated and off-calendar. THERE IS NO PDF DOCUMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ENTRY. (pc) TEXT ONLY ENTRY (Entered: 10/29/2020)"

    "summary": "<p>On March 5, 2010, two female former inmates who were imprisoned in the Century Regional Detention Facility (\"CRDF\"), a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (\"LASD\") facility, filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Represented by a civil rights law firm, the plaintiffs sued the LASD under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. The plaintiffs alleged violations of their Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights, as well as their equivalents under the California Constitution. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that CRDF female inmates were routinely subjected to degrading strip and body cavity searches at the CRDF without probable cause or individualized suspicion.</p>\r\n<p>On October 22, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify class. On February 28, 2011, the LASD moved to dismiss this suit, claiming that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their claims as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\"). The complaint was amended on January 28, 2011, to add five additional former and current CRDF inmates as named plaintiffs. However, on December 27, 2011, District Judge Stephen V. Wilson moved this case to the inactive calendar, pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in <a href=\"../../../../case/11854\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington</em></a>, 132 S.Ct. 1510 (2012), another case involving strip searches, which Judge Wilson believed could affect the viability of relevant precedent.</p>\r\n<p>On April 2, 2012, the Supreme Court decided in <em>Florence</em> that if a prisoner was about to be housed in a jail's general population, no individualized suspicion was required, no matter how minor the arrest offense. Following this decision, on December 19, 2012, Judge Wilson issued an order moving this case back to the active calendar. In addition, Judge Wilson denied the defendant's motion to dismiss, finding that the LASD did not demonstrate sufficient grievance procedures as required by the PLRA. Judge Wilson also determined that the court would rule on the plaintiffs' motion to certify class after the defendants filed their motion for summary judgment. 2012 WL 12878313, C.D. Cal. However, on January 9, 2013, after the plaintiffs requested the court reconsider its decision to defer ruling on the pending motion to certify class, Judge Wilson issued a new order allowing the plaintiffs to re-file their motion to certify class in light of evidence gathered during discovery.</p>\r\n<p>On June 10, 2013, the plaintiffs re-filed their motion to certify class. On March 12, 2014, Judge Wilson granted the plaintiff's request for class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), but denied their request for class certification under Rule 23(b)(3) (299 F.R.D. 618). The court also allowed the plaintiffs to file a renewed motion to certify a damages class on the issue on liability pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4).</p>\r\n<p>On May 19, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a renewed motion to certify class, requesting that the court certify a Rule 23(c)(4) liability class. In addition, the plaintiffs requested that the court reconsider its denial of the plaintiffs' request for Rule 23(b)(3) class certification. As an alternative to this Rule 23(b)(3) reconsideration, the plaintiffs requested that the court certify subclasses under Rule 23(c)(4) on the basis of differing conditions of abuse, privacy, sanitation, and weather during the alleged illegal strip searches. On December 18, 2014, Judge Wilson issued an order granting a Rule 23(c)(4) issue class for the purpose of liability, as well as subclass certification. However, the court denied the plaintiffs' request for Rule 23(b)(3) class certification and all other subclass certifications. 2014 WL 10044904.</p>\r\n<p>On November 18, 2016 (2016 WL 8904537, C.D. Cal.), the court certified an additional two classes as (c)(4) issue classes, despite not certifying the (c)(4) classes in a July 26, 2016 order (2016 WL 6804910, C.D.Cal.). These new classes consisted of a class consisting of women who experienced simultaneous searches and a class consisting of women who experienced one-line-at-a-time searches. 2016 WL 8904537, C.D. Cal.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint on December 2, 2016, and a fourth amended complaint on December 19.</p>\r\n<p>On June 7, 2017, the court issued an order regarding summary judgment motions from both parties. The court granted the defendants' motion, dismissing claims of liability against individual defendants acting as individuals due to qualified immunity. The court also granted the plaintiff's motion, finding that because the defendants had not provided evidence to establish why they conducted searches in the manner that they did when alternatives existed, the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights were violated. 2017 WL 9472901, C.D. Cal.</p>\r\n<p>The parties then engaged in mediation. The plaintiffs submitted a preliminary settlement agreement for $53 million on July 16, 2019, but Judge Wilson did not approve this settlement in a September 23, 2019 hearing. His objection to the settlement centered on the creation of a $3 million fund to finance contracts with Los Angeles-based nonprofit organizations and for-profit groups to &ldquo;develop a strengthened model of gender-responsive policy and operational practice at all LASD facilities that house female inmates.&rdquo; He said that since there was a potential for many claimants to come forward demanding compensation in this case, such a fund should not be established unless there is money left over once all members of the class seeking compensation come forward.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs submitted an amended settlement agreement for the same amount, but removing the fund, on October 31, 2019. Judge Wilson granted preliminary approval to this settlement on November 7, and set a fairness hearing for July 20, 2020, once class members could reasonably be notified.</p>\r\n<p>On January 6, 2020, the third party class administrator began sending notices to the class of 94,857 members.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 6, 2020, a member of the class, filing pro se, objected to the approval of the preliminary settlement agreement, arguing the settlement recovery was &ldquo;miniscule.&rdquo; The class member opted out of the settlement proceeds, but declined to opt out of class membership. The objector proposed that the class administrator should calculate the damages for each class member and allow them another opt-out period once they learned their damages amount.</p>\r\n<p>As of July 6, 2020, the administrator received almost 40,000 claims and approved 25,528, an &ldquo;especially high claims rate for this area of class litigation.&rdquo; In this light, the court granted final approval of the settlement in an August 11, 2020 opinion. Judge Wilson awarded plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel the standard 25 percent fee award, resulting in $13,250,000 in fees and $379,839 in costs. He evaluated the objecting class member&rsquo;s concerns and found the settlement to be fair nonetheless. 2020 WL 5628938.</p>\r\n<p>The court declared the objecting class member an opt-out on August 26, 2020. On September 10, 2020, the objector filed an appeal with the Ninth Circuit. In response, the class action plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on October 1. The court summarily granted the motion on February 12, 2021. 2021 WL 1037119. The objector petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari and was denied on October 4, 2021. 142 S.Ct. 109.</p>\r\n<p>As of February 13, 2025, the third and final round of settlement checks is being distributed to the class.&nbsp;</p>",

Mary Amador was arrested by Los Angeles County Sheriffโs personnel on or \n14 about March 1, 2009. She surrendered to a Detective Corrigan in the parking lot of the \n15 Century Regional Detention Facility (hereafter โCRDFโ), after Detective Corrigan told \n16 advised that she had a welfare fraud warrant for her arrest. CRDF is commonly known \n17 and referred to as the โLynwood Jailโ.  The detective gave Mrs. Amador a week to \n18 surrender so that she could make arrangements for child care for her young daughter, and \n19 so that she could arrange bail. Mrs. Amador surrendered at 9:00 A.M. Bail had already \n20 been posted. \n21 22. Mrs. Amador was strip searched at about 6-7 P.M. that evening in a group \n22 with about 12 other women, outside in the open, in cold air, in an area bordered on one \n23 side by a facility wall and entry door, on another by a solid block wall, on the third by a \n24 solid gate, and on the fourth by a chain link fence shielded by a torn and shredded tarp. \n25 She could see about five male deputies on the other side of the torn tarp. The location was\n26 apparently a driveway, and/or discharge area for buses. \n27\n28\n4\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 6 of 31   Page ID\n #:12006\n1 23. The ground in the area was concrete. The women were required to \n2 completely disrobe, place their street clothes on the ground, squat, spread their buttocks, \n3 lift their breasts, etc., and change into jail attire which they picked up from the ground.\n4 24. One of the women, about 60 years old, complained bitterly of the cold, and \n5 cried.\n6 25. Having spent most of the day with four of the women, Mrs. Amador had \n7 learned that they had just been arrested, and had not yet been to court. Mrs. Amador had \n8 not been to court, either. \n9 26. About an hour after having been strip searched, Mrs. Amador was released \n10 on bail. A jailer told Mrs. Amador that her bail bond had been at the jail since 9:00 A.M. \n11 in the morning. \n12 27. The day after bailing out, Mrs. Amador called the facility to complain about \n13 the strip search. She left a detailed voice mail on the watch commanderโs extension. She \n14 has never heard back, or received any type of acknowledgement of her complaint.. \n15 28. Mrs. Amador and the women were searched as a group with each woman \n16 able to, and forced to, watch the other women being searched. They were forced to stand \n17 naked within inches of each other as they were searched. They were forced to place their \n18 clothing on the unsanitary concrete. This is the same concrete Plaintiff and the women \n19 were forced to stand on, barefoot and naked. \n20 B. LORABARRANCA\n21 29. Lora Barranca was arrested by LASD on or about August 28, 2009. She was \n22 transferred to CRDF on September 2nd or 3rd. She remains in custody, and expects to \n23 remain in custody beyond the date of her next court appearance on September 21, 2010.  \n24 30. During the booking process, LASD strip searched/body cavity searched Ms. \n25 Barranca in a large group of women, in an outdoor area used to park buses (hereafter \n26 โbus stallโ). The women were required to completely disrobe, place their clothes on the \n27 concrete, squat, spread their buttocks, lift their breasts, etc., and change into jail attire, \n28 which they picked up from the concrete.  \n5\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 7 of 31   Page ID\n #:12007\n1 31. LASD personnel at CRDF have strip searched/body cavity searched Ms. \n2 Barranca on multiple occasions, including each time she returned from court, or after \n3 visiting the hospital. All strip searches occurred in the bus stall, and in a group setting. \n4 Ms. Barranca will likely be strip searched/body cavity searched, pursuant to LASD \n5 policy, in the same manner and location when she returns from court on September 21, \n6 2010. \n7 32.  Ms. Barranca has been strip searched in groups as large as 50 women. \n8 Deputies told the women to line up on opposite walls, in two lines of 25 women. Each \n9 detainee could watch the other women being searched, and in fact, could not avoid \n10 watching the other women being searched.  During the search, when the women are \n11 naked and facing each other, they can see each otherโs gang tattoos. I have heard women \n12 at CRDF later discuss which women had a certain kind of gang tattoo.\n13 33. As the women lined up, the deputies shouted โshoulder to shoulder,โ forcing \n14 the women to stand so close that their bodies touched at the shoulders. When the deputies \n15 told Ms. Barranca to bend over for the body cavity search, her thighs also touched the \n16 women adjacent to her.  \n17 34. The bus stall entrance is adjacent to the CRDF booking area. In Ms. \n18 Barrancaโs experience, deputies left the entrance open.  They did not take measures to \n19 block the view of those being strip searched by persons inside the facility. CRDF \n20 personnel, including male personnel, frequently passed the bus stall entrance and could \n21 see the searches taking place. Detainees sitting in a nearby processing area could also \n22 observe the strip searches.  \n23 35. A chain link fence comprises one wall of the bus stall. Ms. Barranca has \n24 been searched in the stall when no tarps or other materials shielded her from the view of \n25 persons outside the stall. The ceiling is also a chain link fence. No tarp covered the \n26 ceiling when Ms. Barranca was initially booked into CRDF. When it drizzles outside, \n27 women in the search area get rained on. \n28\n6\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 8 of 31   Page ID\n #:12008\n1 36. The bus stall is usually very cold in the late afternoon and evening, when \n2 most searches take place. The floor of the bus stall is porous, grey cement. It is dirty.  \n3 Sometimes Ms. Barranca could observe trash lying around from previous searches. She \n4 has also observed menstrual blood on the cement, ants on the ground, insects crawling up \n5 the walls, and oil spots where the busses have dripped oil. Ms. Barranca was forced to \n6 place her clothing on the unsanitary cement. \n7 C. DIANAPAIZ\n8 37. Diana Paiz was arrested on or about February 12, 2010. She was booked into \n9 CRDF on approximately February 17, 2010. She remains in custody, and expects to \n10 remain in custody beyond the date of her next court appearance on September 23, 2010.  \n11 38. LASD personnel at CRDF have strip searched/body cavity searched Ms. \n12 Paiz approximately 5 times, including each time she returned from court. Each of the \n13 searches occurred with a large group of women in an outdoor bus stall. The women were \n14 required to completely disrobe, place their clothes on the cement, squat, spread their \n15 buttocks, lift their breasts, etc., and change into jail attire which they picked up from the \n16 cement. Ms. Paiz will almost certainly be strip searched/body cavity searched in the same \n17 manner and location when she returns from court on September 23, 2010. \n18 39. Ms. Paiz has been strip searched in groups ranging from 20 to 40 women. \n19 Deputies told the women to line up on opposite walls. Each woman could watch the other \n20 women being searched and, in fact, could not avoid watching the other women being \n21 searched.  As the women lined up, the deputies shouted โshoulder to shoulder,โ forcing \n22 the women to stand so close that their bodies touched at the shoulders. Deputies told the \n23 women to put their noses on the wall, which is visibly dirty.  \n24 40. The bus stall entrance is adjacent to the CRDF booking area. In Ms. Paizโs \n25 experience, deputies left the entrance open and did not take measures to block the view of \n26 those being searched from persons inside the facility.\n27 41. The bus stall is usually cold in the late afternoon and evening, when most \n28 searches take place. The concrete is dirty, and sometimes Ms. Paiz could observe trash \n7\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 9 of 31   Page ID\n #:12009\n1 lying around from previous searches. During searches, Ms. Paiz was forced to place her \n2 clothing on the unsanitary cement.\n3 42. Guards routinely gave instructions using abusive and profane language. \n4 After women undressed, the guards laughed at them, making jokes about the appearance \n5 of their bodies and how the area smelled.  \n6 43. Some severely overweight or physically disabled women cannot expose their \n7 body cavities by bending over. They are subjected to an even less dignified search: the \n8 guards order them to sit or lie on the bare concrete, spread their legs and raise their feet \n9 off the ground. \n10 D. DIANEVIGIL\n11 44. Diane Vigil was arrested by LASD on or about May 9, 2010. Ms. Vigil was \n12 transferred to CRDF on May 12, 2010. She remains in custody and expects to remain in \n13 custody beyond the date of her next court appearance on September 28, 2010.  \n14 45. During the booking process, LASD strip searched/body cavity searched Ms. \n15 Vigil with a large group of women, in an outdoor bus stall. The women were required to \n16 completely disrobe, place their clothes on the ground, squat, spread their buttocks, lift \n17 their breasts, etc., and change into jail attire, which they picked up from the cement. Ms. \n18 Vigil began menstruating shortly before she arrived at CDRF for booking, though she did \n19 not realize it until she pulled down her underwear for the body cavity search. She \n20 requested a sanitary napkin, but was chastised for not informing them earlier. Even \n21 though blood was dripping down her leg and onto the ground, she had to wait for a \n22 sanitary napkin until after the body cavity search was finished.\n23 46. CRDF has strip searched/body cavity searched Ms. Vigil approximately 5  \n24 times, including each time she returned from court. All strip searches occurred in the bus \n25 stall and en masse. Ms. Vigil will almost likely be strip searched/body cavity searched in \n26 the same manner and location when she returns from court on September 23, 2010. \n27 47. Ms. Vigil has been strip searched in groups as large as 50 women. Deputies \n28 told the women to line up on opposite walls. Each woman could watch the other women \n8\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 10 of 31   Page ID\n #:12010\n1 being searched and, in fact, could not avoid watching the other women being searched.\n2 As the women lined up, the deputies shouted โshoulder to shoulder,โ forcing women to \n3 stand so close that their bodies touched at the shoulders.  \n4 48. The bus stall entrance is adjacent to the CRDF booking area. In Ms. Vigilโs \n5 experience, deputies left the entrance open and typically did not take measures to block \n6 the view of those being searched from persons inside the facility. Prior to August 18, \n7 2010, Ms. Vigil had never observed deputies move laundry carts in front of the doors.\n8 49. The bus stall is usually cold in the late afternoon and evening, when most \n9 searches take place. The cement is dirty and sometimes Ms. Vigil could observe trash \n10 lying around from previous searches. She has also observed menstrual blood on the \n11 cement and ants crawling on the ground. \n12 50. Guards routinely gave instructions using abusive and profane language.  \n13 51. Some severely overweight or physically disabled women cannot expose their \n14 body cavities by bending over. They are subjected to an even less dignified search: the \n15 guards order them to sit on the bare concrete, spread their legs and raise their feet off the \n16 ground. \n17 E. ALISABATTISTE\n18 52. Alisa Battiste was arrested by LASD deputies on January 30, 2010 and was \n19 transferred directly to CRDF on January 31, 2010, before going to court. Upon \n20 processing into CRDF and each time she came back from court (about 7-8 times), she \n21 was strip and visual body cavity searched outdoors, in a bus stall adjacent to the booking \n22 area.\n23 53. Each time she was searched, Ms. Battiste and the women being searched \n24 with her were forced to stand close together, strip naked, face the women across from \n25 them, lift their breasts and stomachs, open their mouths, use their fingers to spread their \n26 cheeks (without an opportunity to wash their hands first), turn to face the wall, bend over, \n27 use their hands to spread their buttocks and vaginas, and cough while guards looked into \n28 their body cavities. \n9\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 11 of 31   Page ID\n #:12011\n1 54. Ms. Battiste and the other women then had to lift each foot and wiggle their \n2 toes. Many women would lose their balance attempting to stand on one foot and would \n3 fall over, while naked, and bump into one of the naked women next to them. \n4 55. If a woman was menstruating, she had to remove her soiled menstrual pad, \n5 or pull out her used tampon while in the group, put it into a box, and then put the box on \n6 the ground. \n7 56. The bus stall is connected to the interior of the jail by sliding glass doors \n8 which were always open during the searches. When Ms. Battiste was searched in the bus \n9 stall, inmates were usually chained to the benches just inside the door.  They could see \n10 the searches. Sometimes it was inmates in yellow jump suits whom Ms. Battiste \n11 understood to have mental problems, or were โ5150โ. Male deputies and other jail staff \n12 walking by could also see the searches. Although the door was always open, because the \n13 door is made of glass guards and inmates on the other side would be able to see the \n14 searches even if the door were closed.\n15 57. After the searches, Ms. Battiste and the other women would put on jail \n16 clothes which were placed on the ground before the women were allowed to put them on. \n17 Because the searches took place outside, in a bus stall, there was often dirt, dust and \n18 sometimes even ants on the clothes they picked up from the ground. The ground was \n19 concrete and dirty, even stained with menstrual blood. Ms. Battisteโs feet were often dirty \n20 from standing bare-foot during the searches, but the deputies would sometimes not allow \n21 the women to shower until the following day. \n22 58. Every time Ms. Battiste was strip searched, she felt embarrassed and \n23 humiliated as a woman. She felt it robbed her of her femininity, of her womanhood. \n24 Every time she was strip searched, at least one woman in the group would cry, especially \n25 the younger women, who felt especially embarrassed about having to expose their bodies. \n26 F.  FELICECHOLEWIAK\n27 59. On or about March 26, 2010, Felice Cholewiak was arrested by LAPD and \n28 taken directly to CRDF.  Ms. Cholewiak was strip searched upon arriving at CRDF, and \n10\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 12 of 31   Page ID\n #:12012\n1 each time she returned from court.  Each strip search was conducted outdoors in an area \n2 where she has been buses parked She estimates that she was strip searched 5 times.\n.\n3 62. On one side of this bus depot area, there is a blue tarp. The opposite wall is a \n4 brick wall. These walls are approximately 15-20 feet apart. Along another wall, there is a \n5 roll-up door where buses come in and out. Opposite the roll-up door is the entrance to the \n6\n bus depot strip search area. The door to this area is always open. Ms. Cholewiak has \n7\nnever seen anything obstructing this doorway. She has seen male deputies and male \n8\nworkers walk by the entrance to the bus depot. These males have an unobstructed view to \n9\nthe bus depot when women are being strip searched. The floor of the depot is porous, \n10\ngrey cement, like a sidewalk.  Ms. Cholewiak has seen motor oil on the floor of the bus \n11\ndepot. She has seen blood on the floor of the bus depot. She has seen bird poop on the \n12\nfloor of the bus depot, and bird feathers in the bus depot. \n13\n63. Before being strip searched in the bus depot area, Ms. Cholewiak was taken \n14\nto a holding cell. She has waited in that holding cell to be strip searched between 1 to 3 \n15\nhours. At times it appeared that deputies are waiting for more women to arrive so that \n16\nthey can strip search more women at one time. At other times it appeared that deputies \n17\nare waiting for shift change so that the next shift had to strip search the women. \n18\nDuring a strip search, from 60 to80 women are taken off the buses returning from court, \n19\nand are lined up inside the bus depot against the blue tarp wall and the brick wall.  The \n20\nwomen are divided into two lines, each line facing the other.  While deputies are lining \n21\nthe women up, they are constantly ordering them to stand \"shoulder to shoulder\" and to \n22\n\"get closer.\" They are sometimes standing so close that they touch each other. \n23\n24 64. After the women are lined up, they are ordered to remove all clothing except \n25 their underwear.  The clothing is then searched and thrown on the ground behind them. \n26 Shoes are removed along with the clothing and the women stand barefoot during the \n27 searches.  They are ordered to lift their feet.  Ms. Cholewiak and a number of other \n28 women must steady themselves by touching the wall in front of her. \n11\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 13 of 31   Page ID\n #:12013\n1 65. Deputies then shouted โIf youโre bleeding and if you have anything between \n2 your legsโ to take out the pad or tampon.  Deputies then gave the women jail issue pads \n3 in boxes.   Ms. Cholewiak and the women were ordered to put the used pads or tampons \n4 in the boxes and put the new pads on the ground on top of their clothing.  At that point, \n5 they were ordered to turn around and Ms. Cholewiak could see the topless women across\n6 from her and next to her.  She could see gang tattoos on some women, and has heard \n7 discussions among some of the women about the tattoos.\n8 66. The women were then ordered to lift their hair, to lift their breasts and, those \n9 with โexcess fatโ were ordered to lift their stomachs.  They were then ordered to pull \n10 their lips away from their gums, using the same fingers used to remove the menstrual \n11 pads and tampons. Ms. Cholewiak and the women were never able to wash their hands \n12 before putting them in their mouths.  They were then ordered to take down their \n13 underwear, spread their legs, bend over, open their vaginas with their fingers and cough \n14 so deputies could inspect the vaginas with flashlights.  While bending over, Ms. \n15 Cholewiak was able to see the women in the line across from her also bending over.\n16 67. Ms. Cholewiak and the women were then ordered to pull up their underwear, \n17 put on shirts, pants and shoes, but sock and bras must go in pockets.  The searches \n18 average about 20 minutes, but can take much longer if women do not comply quickly. \n19 Ms. Cholewiak has heard deputies yell, scream and curse at women who do not move \n20 quickly enough, or those who do not speak English.  She has seen deputies taunt women,\n21 and make derogatory remarks within the womenโs hearing.  Women often cry during the \n22 searches. \n23 68. Because the searches took place outside, sometimes as late as 10 PM, the \n24 weather was very cold and Ms. Cholewiak could feel the cold wind blowing through the \n25 space.  Every time Ms. Cholewiak was searched, she would be disgusted and tearful.  She \n26 was emotionally exhausted after every search.\n27\n28\n12\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 14 of 31   Page ID\n #:12014\n1 G.  EVANGELINAMADRID\n2 69. Evangelina Madridโs experiences with CRDF began around October 4, 2009 \n3 when she was first arrested by LASD and taken to CRDF.  She estimates that she was \n4 strip searched between 10 to 12 times upon each entry into CRDF, and each time she \n5 returned from court.  Except for those times when Ms. Madrid returned to CRDF from a \n6 medical appointment, she was searched in an outdoor area where she has seen buses \n7 parked.\n8 70. One side of the bus depo is a chain link fence which is covered by a blue \n9 tarp.  The opposite wall is brick.  These walls are about 15-20 feet apart.  Along another \n10 wall is a roll-up door where buses come in and out. Opposite the roll-up door is the \n11 entrance to the bus stall from the booking area. Male deputies and workers walking by \n12 the entrance to the bus depo can see the women being searched.  Ms. Madrid states that \n13 there is no privacy and she and the other women are completely exposed. \n14 71. The floor of the bus stall is porous, grey cement, like a sidewalk. Ms. \n15 Madrid has seen worms and slug-like creatures crawling on the floor, and has seen motor \n16 oil on the floor as well. The ceiling of the stall is a chain link fence covered by a blue tarp \n17 which sometimes flaps up and down in the wind.  Ms. Madrid has been searched outside \n18 in this bus area in the winter when the air feels freezing cold, the cold air blows through \n19 the chain link fencing and the temperature is well below 68 degrees.  Sometimes the \n20 searches were done as late as 10 or 11 P.M. \n21 72. Ms. Madrid was searched with 20 to 50 other women who were taken from \n22 buses after court.  They are lined up in the bus stall against the chain link and the brick \n23 wall.  After the women are lined up, they are ordered to remove all clothing except their \n24 underwear.  Because the women are forced to stand so close together, Ms. Madrid could \n25 often smell the body odor of women who had not showered.  The clothing is then \n26 searched and thrown on the ground behind them. Shoes are removed along with the \n27 clothing and the women stand barefoot during the searches.  They were then ordered to \n28 lift their hair, to lift their breasts, and to pull their lips away from their gums.  Ms. Madrid \n13\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 15 of 31   Page ID\n #:12015\n1 could see the topless bodies of the women in the line facing her.  She could tell who had \n2 breast implants, stretch marks, and those with gang tattoos. \n3 73. Ms. Madrid and the other women were then ordered to face the wall, take \n4 down their underwear, spread their legs, bend over, open their vaginas with their fingers \n5 and cough.  Sometimes they were ordered to cough for a long as 3 minutes while deputies \n6 inspected their vaginas with flashlights. While bent over, Ms. Madrid could see the \n7 women in the line facing her also bending over.  These searches could take as long as 15- \n8 20 minutes if some women were not complying. \n9 74. Ms. Madrid has been strip searched when she was menstruating.  She was \n10 given a jail issue pad in a cardboard box, ordered to take the new pad and place it on her \n11 clothing on the floor of the stall, remove the old pad and put it in the box, and throw the \n12 box into the middle of the bus stall.  She had to wait about 5 minutes to replace her pad, \n13 and at times had to wait up to 15 minutes.  Ms. Madrid stated that she prayed she \n14 wouldnโt bleed while waiting to replace her pad. \n15 75. Ms. Madrid has heard deputies yell and curse at the women in the most \n16 insulting ways.  She has seen deputies grab women who were not complying and throw \n17 them against the wall.  She has often seen women crying during the search process.   \n18 Each time she was strip searched, she felt demoralized, humiliated and depressed. \n19 H.  MYESHIAWILLIAMS\n20 76. Myeshia Williams incarcerated at CRDF between January 2010 and October \n21 2011. During this time period, Ms. Williams was strip searched/visual body cavity \n22 searched each time she returned from court and medical appointments.  Ms. Williams \n23 returned to CRDF, and was strip searched/visual body cavity searched, approximately 6 \n24 times after June 30, 2011. \n25 77. With few exceptions, searches occurred in an outdoor area used to park \n26 buses. Because the search area is outdoors, it was usually very cold and almost always \n27 cold when the searches were conducted at night. She was searched outside when the \n28 temperature was below 77 degrees. The outdoor search area was not sealed to insects or \n14\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 16 of 31   Page ID\n #:12016\n1 birds. On at least several occasions, she observed ants, spiders and gnats in the search \n2 area. She also observed bird droppings on the ground. \n3 78. Most searches occurred in large groups, of approximately 40 inmates. At the \n4 beginning of the search, inmates were ordered to line up along the walls of the bus bay, \n5 remove all clothing except for underwear and submit to an inspection of their feet and \n6 hair. Deputies then ordered the inmates to face the center of the room and lift their arms, \n7 breasts and stomach, in the presence of the group. Deputies also inspected their mouths \n8 by requiring inmates to run their fingers between their lips and gums. Deputies then \n9 ordered inmates to submit to a visual body cavity inspection. Ms. Williams was required \n10 to face the wall, pull down her underwear, spread her legs, bend at the waist and reach \n11 around her body to spread apart her labia to permit an inspection of her vagina.  \n12 79. Ms. Williams has been searched while she was menstruating, including at \n13 least one occasion after June 30, 2011.  When menstruating, she was ordered to identify \n14 herself by raising her hand, remove her soiled tampon or pad in the presence of the group, \n15 submit to a visual body cavity inspection while bleeding, and wait until the completion of \n16 the search before replacing her feminine hygiene products. \n17 80. The bus garage was maintained in filthy condition. Ms. Williams observed \n18 trash not cleaned up from previous searches. During some searches, she observed blood, \n19 vomit or urine on the floor. \n20 I.  NANCYBRISEรO\n21 81. Nancy Briseรฑo was incarcerated at CRDF from approximately November \n22 2011 through approximately March 2012. She was strip searched/visual body cavity \n23 searched each time she returned to CRDF from court. Ms. Briseรฑo  was searched \n24 approximately 14 times after June 30, 2011. \n25 82. With few exceptions, searches occurred in an outdoor area used to park \n26 buses. Ms. Briseรฑo was searched in temperatures that felt very cold, well below 77 \n27 degrees. On one occasion, Ms. Briseรฑo was searched while it was raining. Rain water fell \n28\n15\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 17 of 31   Page ID\n #:12017\n1 through the tarps and onto inmatesโ bodies. The outdoor search area was not sealed to \n2 birds or insects. Ms. Briseรฑo observed flies in the bus bay. \n3 83. Most searches occurred in large groups of as many as 50 inmates. At the \n4 beginning of the search, inmates were ordered to line up along the walls of the bus bay, \n5 remove all clothing except for underwear and submit to an inspection of their feet and \n6 hair. Deputies then ordered the inmates to face the center of the room and lift their arms, \n7 breasts and stomach, in the presence of the group. Deputies also inspected their mouths \n8 by requiring inmates to run their fingers between their lips and gums. Deputies then \n9 ordered inmates to submit to a visual body cavity inspection. Ms. Briseรฑo was required to \n10 face the wall, pull down her underwear, spread her legs, bend at the waist and reach \n11 around her body to spread apart her labia to permit an inspection of her vagina.  \n12 84. Ms. Briseรฑo has been searched while she was menstruating. When \n13 menstruating, she was ordered to identify herself by raising her hand, remove her soiled \n14 tampon or pad in the presence of the group, submit to a visual body cavity inspection \n15 while bleeding, and wait until the completion of the search before replacing her feminine \n16 hygiene products. On one occasion, Ms. Briseรฑo  observed a menstruating woman expel a \n17 blood clot onto the floor during the strip search. \n18 85. The bus garage was not maintained in clean condition. Ms. Briseรฑo observed \n19 soiled sanitary napkins on the floor, left behind from previous searches. She also \n20 observed blood on the ground.\n21 J.  EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVEREMEDIES\n22 86. Ms. Paiz and Ms. Barranca properly filed complaints (i.e. grievances) on \n23 approximately August 6, 2010.  Their complaints requested a sanitary, indoor location for \n24 all strip searches, hidden from the view of anyone not directly involved in the strip each \n25 (including inmates). They also requested equal treatment for men and women. \n26 87. Ms. Vigil did not personally file a complaint, but, instead, submitted a \n27 complaint letter through her attorneys to Captain Stacy Lee, also on August 6th. This\n28\n16\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 18 of 31   Page ID\n #:12018\n1 procedure was expressly authorized by defendant County of Los Angeles because \n2 Michael Gennaco, chief attorney for the Countyโs Office of Independent Review, \n3 informed one of Plaintiffsโ counsel that a valid means of filing an internal complaint was \n4 to send a letter authored by counsel on behalf of an inmate setting forth the inmateโs \n5 grievance. Ms. Vigilโs counsel requested CRDF to advise of any steps that must be taken \n6 in order to comply with complaint exhaustion requirements from the initial complaint \n7 through all appeal/review processes.  \n8 88. Under LASD policy, whenever possible, custody personnel must respond to \n9 inmate complaints within 10 days. As of September 9, 2010, CRDF had not notified any \n10 of the Plaintiffs regarding the disposition of their complaints. Without a response, they \n11 cannot appeal or otherwise seek review. CRDF has not advised Plaintiffs of what \n12 additional steps, if any, must be taken to comply with the complaint exhaustion process.\n13 89. On August 20, 2010, Plaintiffsโ counsel sent a letter to Captain Stacy Lee to \n14 determine the status of all three complaints. Captain Leeโs office has not responded to the \n15 letter or to follow-up phone calls placed by Plaintiffsโ attorneys.  \n16 90. Ms. Barranca, Ms. Paiz and Ms. Vigil have satisfied their obligation to \n17 exhaust available remedies. CRDF rendered the complaint process unavailable by \n18 ignoring their complaints. Dole v. Chandler, 438 F.3d 804, 809, 812 (โโฆa remedy \n19 becomes โunavailableโ if prison employees do not respond to a properly filed grievance \n20 or otherwise use affirmative misconduct to prevent a prisoner from exhausting.โ); Tuttle\n21 v.

Mich. 2009) (holding that prisoner whose \n22 grievance was not answered timely and whose requests for an appeal form were denied or \n23 ignored had exhausted available remedies); Underwood v.

On information and belief, Plaintiffs allege \n15 the strip and/or visual body cavity searches to which they and class members were \n16 subjected, were performed pursuant to Defendantsโ policy and practice to \n17 indiscriminately search all, or a large number of women, but not men being processed \n18 into the jail without regard to: a) The nature of their offense or criminal history; b) \n19 Whether they are under an order of release or not; c) Whether they have had contact with \n20 any persons from outside the County jail system who could reasonably be believed to be \n21 a potential source of contraband or weapons; d) Whether there is cause of any kind to \n22 believe they are a potential source of contraband or weapons; e) Whether there is any \n23 other articulable justification for Defendantsโ indiscriminate strip and body search policy; \n24 f) Whether they are โpre-arraignment detainees,โ as that term is used in California Penal \n25 Code ยง4030(b); and g) Whether there is any legitimate reason to strip search women, but \n26 not men, as set forth herein. \n27 95. On information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have a policy of \n28 not limiting the persons who can see, or hear, or observe all or part of the strip and body\n18\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 20 of 31   Page ID\n #:12020\n1 cavity searches to those who are necessary for the procedure. Thus, other inmates, \n2 members of the opposite sex, dispensable jail personnel and possibly others are able to \n3 see or hear some or all of the searches described above. Specifically, class members are \n4 required to submit to strip searches during which other people who are not participating \n5 in the search and/or are of the opposite sex, including jail staff and other inmates, are able \n6 to observe the search and the class membersโ naked bodies. On further information and \n7 belief, in many instances class members are forced to touch each otherโs bodies during \n8 the searches in order to comply with the directions given by Sheriffโs deputies.  \n9 96. Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf, and on behalf of a class of all \n10 other persons similarly situated, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil \n11 Procedure. The class is defined as those women who were forced to undergo the unlawful \n12 strip and/or visual body cavity searches in Los Angeles Countyโs jails which are\n13 operated, maintained and under the control of the County, the LASD and the Supervisory \n14 Defendants as set forth in this complaint; to wit, searches that violated the Fourth \n15 Amendment or its California equivalent, or searches that violated equal protection of the \n16 law due to the fact that that the policy and custom of strip searches was applied to \n17 women, but not to men. \n18 97. Due to the previous filing of Solis v. Baca, No. CV06-1135 SVW (CTx), a \n19 case currently pending in this court, the class period goes back two years prior to the \n20 filing of that case, which also alleges violation of the Fourth Amendment and equal \n21 protection rights of those subjected to strip searches by the Los Angeles County Sheriffโs \n22 Department. Because the pendency of that case has tolled the statute of limitations for the \n23 class members herein, the statute of limitations in this case reaches back to May 30, 2004.\n24 98. Plaintiffs have also engaged in pre-litigation settlement efforts.  Specifically, \n25 Plaintiffs showed Defendants a draft copy of this complaint, and asked that Defendants \n26 immediately cease and desist their unlawful practices.  Plaintiffs also raised this issue \n27 with Defendantsโ counsel during a meeting to discuss county strip search policies.  To \n28 date, and to Plaintiffsโ knowledge, Defendants continue to engage in the unlawful \n19\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 21 of 31   Page ID\n #:12021\n1 practices detailed in this complaint. \n2 a. RULE23PREREQUISITES\n3 i. Numerosity\n4 99. In accordance with F.R.Civ. P. Rule 23(a), the members of the class are so \n5 numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Plaintiffs do not know the exact \n6 number of class members. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that\n7 there are more than 300 inmates per day who are subjected to strip and/or body cavity \n8 searches as a result of Defendantsโ policy and practice of indiscriminately subjecting \n9 prisoners to strip and body cavity searches. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and \n10 thereon allege, that the number of persons in the proposed class is in the thousands. \n11 ii. Common Issues of Fact or Law \n12 100. In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), there are questions of fact \n13 common to the class. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that the \n14 common questions of fact include, but are not limited to the following: (1) Whether the  \n15 LASD routinely subjects all prisoners to strip and/or body cavity searches without any \n16 reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe any particular \n17 inmate has concealed drug(s), weapon(s) and/or any contraband on their persons or in \n18 their body cavities; (2) Whether the strip and/or body cavity searches are conducted in an \n19 area of privacy so that the search cannot be observed by persons not participating in the \n20 search, or whether the strip and body cavity searches are conducted in areas where they \n21 may be observed by persons not participating in the searches; (3) Whether the strip and/or \n22 body cavity searches are conducted in an unsanitary area, infested with bacteria such as\n23 MRSA and other communicable diseases; (4) Whether females are subjected to strip \n24 and/or body cavity searches when males are not; (5) Whether females are subjected to \n25 strip and/or body cavity searches under conditions which are more intrusive and less \n26 sanitary than males. \n27\n28\n20\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 22 of 31   Page ID\n #:12022\n1 101. In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), there are questions of law \n2 common to the class. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and, thereon allege, that the \n3 common questions of law include but are not limited to the following: (1) Whether the  \n4 LASD may indiscriminately conduct strip and/or body cavity searches of inmates without \n5 there being any reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe any \n6 particular inmate has concealed drug(s), weapon(s) and/or any contraband on their \n7 persons or in their body cavities; (2) Whether the LASD may conduct strip and/or body \n8 cavity searches of inmates in open areas where they may be observed by persons not  \n9 participating in the searches; (3) Whether LASDโs policy of subjecting persons to strip \n10 and/or body cavity searches violates California Penal Code ยง4030; (4) Whether LASDโs \n11 policy of subjecting persons to strip and/or body cavity searches in an area which is not \n12 an โarea of privacyโ violates California Penal Code ยง4030(m); (5) Whether the conduct \n13 described above violates the Fourth and/or Fourteenth Amendments, and/or California \n14 Constitution Article I, ยงยง1, 7, and/or 13; (6) Whether the conduct described above \n15 constitutes a policy or custom of Defendants; (7) Whether any individual Defendant is \n16 entitled to qualified immunity on the federal claims, or state law immunity on the state  \n17 law claims, for the practices complained of herein; and (8) Whether determination of \n18 damages suffered by a statistically representative sample of the class provides the basis \n19 for determination of all class membersโ damages except those who opt out, or whether \n20 category damages may appropriately be determined for the class members. \n21 iii. Typicality\n22 102. In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), the claims of the representative \n23 Plaintiffs are typical of the class. Plaintiffs were in LASD custody when they were \n24 subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity searches of inmates without any reasonable  \n25 suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe that any Plaintiff and class \n26 members had concealed drug(s), weapon(s) and/or any contraband in their body cavities; \n27 Plaintiffs were subjected to the searches in open areas where they were observed by other \n28 inmates and persons not involved in the search, including sometimes members of the \n21\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 23 of 31   Page ID\n #:12023\n1 opposite sex; Plaintiffs were searched and forced to stand naked in unsanitary and \n2 bacteria infested areas; females were subjected to strip and/or body cavity searches when \n3 males were not; and females were subjected to strip and/or body cavity searches under \n4 conditions which were more intrusive and less sanitary than males. \n5 103. Thus, Plaintiffs have the same interests and have suffered the same type of \n6 damages as the class members. Plaintiffsโ claims are based upon the same or similar legal \n7 theories as the claims of the class members. Each class member suffered actual damages \n8 as a result of being subjected to a strip and/or body cavity search. The actual damages \n9 suffered by Plaintiffs are similar in type and amount to the actual damages suffered by \n10 each class member. \n11 104. In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), the representative Plaintiffs will \n12 fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. The interests of the representative \n13 Plaintiffs are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class. \n14 iv. Maintenance and Superiority \n15 105. In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(1)(A), prosecutions of separate \n16 actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that inconsistent or \n17 varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would establish \n18 incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the class. \n19 106. In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions of separate \n20 actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of adjudications with \n21 respect to individual members of the class which would, as a practical matter, \n22 substantially impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class to protect \n23 their interests. \n24 107. In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(2), Plaintiffs are informed and \n25 believe, and thereon allege that Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to \n26 the class. \n27 108. In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(3), the questions of law or fact \n28 common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only \n22\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 24 of 31   Page ID\n #:12024\n1 individual members, and this class action is superior to other available methods for the \n2 fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy between the parties. Plaintiffs are \n3 informed and believe, and thereon allege, that the interests of class members in \n4 individually controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low in that most class  \n5 members would be unable to individually prosecute any action at all. Plaintiffs are \n6 informed and believe, and thereon allege that the amounts at stake for individuals are \n7 such that separate suits would be impracticable in that most members of the class will not \n8 be able to find counsel to represent them. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon \n9 allege, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the \n10 claims arise in the same location, i.e., the County of Los Angeles. It will promote judicial \n11 efficiency to resolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum rather than in \n12 multiple courts. \n13 109. Plaintiffs do not know the identities of the class members. Plaintiffs are \n14 informed and believe, and thereon allege, that the identities of the class members are \n15 ascertainable from LASD records, in particular the LASD AJIS computer system used to \n16 track and identify LASD inmates. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege,\n17 that AJIS reflects the identities, including addresses and telephone numbers, of the \n18 persons who have been held in custody by LASD; when inmates were arrested and \n19 booked, taken to court, returned from court; why inmates were released; and when \n20 inmates were released.\n21 110. Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that will be encountered in the management \n22 of this litigation that would preclude its maintenance as a class action. The class action is \n23 superior to any other available means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the class.\n24 The class action will be manageable because so many different records systems exist \n25 from which to ascertain the members of the class. Liability can be determined on a class-\n26 wide basis. Damages can be determined on a class-wide basis using a damages matrix set \n27 by a jury, or by trying the damages of a statistically valid sample of the class to a jury and \n28 extrapolating those damages to the class as a whole. \n23\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 25 of 31   Page ID\n #:12025\n1 111. In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(3), class members must be \n2 furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual \n3 notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort. Plaintiffs are \n4 informed and believe that LASD computer records contain a last known address for class \n5 members. Plaintiffs contemplate that individual notice be given to class members at such \n6 last known address by first class mail. Plaintiffs contemplate that the notice inform class \n7 members of the following: \n8 A.  The pendency of the class action, and the issues common to the class; \n9 B.  The nature of the action; \n10 C.  Their right to โopt outโ of the action within a given time, in which \n11 event they will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class \n12 action;\n13 D. Their right, if they do not โopt out,โ to be represented by their own \n14\ncounsel and enter an appearance in the case; otherwise, they will be \n15\nrepresented by the named Plaintiffs and their counsel; and \n16\nE.  Their right, if they do not โopt out,โ to share in any recovery in favor \n17\nof the class, and conversely to be bound by any judgment on the \n18\ncommon issues, adverse to the class. \n19\n112.  Plaintiffs restate and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing and \n20\nensuing paragraphs in each of the following causes of action as if each paragraph was \n21\nfully set forth therein.\n22\nCOUNT ONE โ 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 [FOURTH AMENDMENT] \n23 (All Defendants) \n24\n113.  In subjecting Plaintiffs and class members to the unnecessary, demeaning, \n25\nand outrageous intrusive strip and body cavity search, Defendants, and each of them, \n26\nviolated Plaintiffsโ and class membersโ rights to be secure in their persons against \n27\nunreasonable searches and seizures as guaranteed by the Fourth and Fourteenth \n28\n24\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 26 of 31   Page ID\n #:12026\n1 Amendments to the United States Constitution. Therefore, Plaintiffs and class members \n2 are entitled to bring suit and recover damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง1983.\n3 114. The aforementioned acts of Defendants proximately caused Plaintiffs to be \n4 deprived of their rights as stated above, thereby entitling Plaintiffs and the class to \n5 damages in an amount to be proven at trial.  \n6 115. Plaintiffs Lora Barranca, Diana Paiz and Diane Vigil remain incarcerated at \n7 CRDF, and will remain incarcerated beyond their upcoming court appearances. Because \n8 CRDF will require them to submit to strip searches/body cavity searches upon returning  \n9 from court, they will continue to suffer deprivations of their rights and, therefore, seek \n10 injunctive relief on behalf of themselves and the class of similarly situated individuals. \n11 COUNT TWO โ 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 [EQUAL PROTECTION] \n12\n (All Defendants)\n13\n116.  The unequal treatment of men and women โ and the unnecessary, \n14\ndemeaning, and outrageous intrusive strip and body cavity searches inflicted on women \n15\nbut not men โ deprived the female class members of the protections afforded by \n16\nprovisions of the 14th Amendment Equal Protection guarantees. Therefore, the female \n17\nPlaintiffs and class members are entitled to bring suit and recover damages pursuant to 42 \n18\nU.S.C. ยง1983.\n19\n117. The aforementioned acts of Defendants proximately caused Plaintiffs to be \n20\ndeprived of their rights as stated above, thereby entitling Plaintiffs and the class to \n21\ndamages in an amount to be proven at trial.  \n22\n118. Plaintiffs Lora Barranca, Diana Paiz and Diane Vigil remain incarcerated at \n23\nCRDF and will remain incarcerated beyond their upcoming court appearances. Because  \n24\nCRDF will require them to submit to strip searches/body cavity searches upon  returning \n25\nfrom court, they will continue to suffer deprivations of their rights and therefore seek \n26\ninjunctive relief on behalf of themselves and the class of similarly situated individuals. \n27\nCOUNT THREE โ ARTICLE 1, ยงยง1 AND 13 OF THE CALIFORNIA \n28\nCONSTITUTION [PRIVACY/FOURTH AMENDMENT ANALOGUE] \n25\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 27 of 31   Page ID\n #:12027\n1  (All Defendants) \n2\n119.  Plaintiffs filed a Govt. Code ยง910 claim for damages against Defendants for \n3\nthe matters set forth in this complaint, thereby making it unnecessary for the newly added \n4\nnamed Plaintiffs to file individual ยง910 claims.\n5\n120. The unnecessary, demeaning, outrageous, and intrusive strip and body cavity \n6\nsearch to which Plaintiffs and class members were subjected violated Plaintiffsโ rights not \n7\nto be subjected to invasion of their fundamental privacy interests, as guaranteed by\n8\nArticle I, ยง1 of the California Constitution; and to be secure in their persons against \n9\nunreasonable searches and seizures, as guaranteed by Article I, ยง13 of the California \n10\nConstitution.\n11\n121. The aforementioned acts of Defendants proximately caused Plaintiffs to be \n12\ndeprived of their rights as stated above, thereby entitling Plaintiffs and the class to \n13\ndamages in an amount to be proven at trial.  \n14\n122. Plaintiffs Lora Barranca, Diana Paiz and Diane Vigil remain incarcerated at \n15\nCRDF, and will remain incarcerated beyond their upcoming court appearances. Because \n16\nCRDF will require them to submit to strip searches/body cavity searches upon returning \n17\nfrom court, they will continue to suffer deprivations of their rights and, therefore, seek \n18\ninjunctive relief on behalf of themselves and the class of similarly situated individuals. \n19\nCOUNT FOUR โ ARTICLE 1, ยง7, OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION \n20\n[EQUAL PROTECTION] \n21\n (All Defendants) \n22\n123. The unequal treatment of men and women violated the female Plaintiffsโ \n23\nrights not to be denied equal protection of the law, as guaranteed by Article I, ยง7 of the \n24\nCalifornia Constitution, and to be secure in their persons against unreasonable searches \n25\nand seizures as guaranteed by Article I, ยง 13 of the California Constitution.\n26\n124. The aforementioned acts of Defendants proximately caused Plaintiffs to be \n27\ndeprived of their rights as stated above, thereby entitling Plaintiffs and the class to \n28\ndamages in an amount to be proven at trial.  \n26\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 28 of 31   Page ID\n #:12028\n1 125. Plaintiffs Lora Barranca, Diana Paiz and Diane Vigil remain incarcerated at \n2 CRDF, and will remain incarcerated beyond their upcoming court appearances. Because \n3 CRDF will require them to submit to strip searches/body cavity searches upon  returning \n4 from court, they will continue to suffer deprivations of their rights and, therefore, seek \n5 injunctive relief on behalf of themselves and the class of similarly situated individuals. \n6 COUNT FIVE - Cal. Civ. Code ยง52.1 \n(All Defendants) \n7\n8 126. The unnecessary, demeaning, and outrageous intrusive strip and/or visual \n9 body cavity searches alleged herein were accomplished via threat, intimidation or \n10 coercion and/or threats of the same. \n11 127. The unnecessary, demeaning, and outrageous intrusive strip and visual body \n12 cavity searches, and the unequal treatment of women as opposed to men, deprived \n13 Plaintiffs and the class they represent of the protections afforded by provisions of federal \n14 constitutional and state constitutional and statutory law including, but not limited to \n15 rights protected under the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \n16 States Constitution; Article I, ยงยง1, 7, 13, and 17, of the California state constitution, and \n17 California Penal Code ยง4030. Therefore, Plaintiffs and the class are entitled to bring suit \n18 and recover damages pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code ยง52.1(b). \n19 128.  As a direct and proximate cause of the aforementioned acts, Plaintiffs and \n20 class members were damaged in an amount to be proven at trial but in any event not less \n21 than $4,000 per violation pursuant to the provisions of Civil Code ยง52(b). \n22 129.  The aforementioned acts of Defendants directly and proximately caused  \n23 Plaintiffs to be deprived of their California constitutional rights as stated above, thereby \n24 entitling Plaintiffs and class members to recover damages proximately caused by \n25 Defendantsโ wrongful acts. \n26 130. Plaintiffs Lora Barranca, Diana Paiz and Diane Vigil remain incarcerated at \n27 CRDF, and will remain incarcerated beyond their upcoming court appearances. Because \n28 CRDF will require them to submit to strip searches/body cavity searches upon  returning \n27\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 29 of 31   Page ID\n #:12029\n1 from court, they will continue to suffer deprivations of their rights and therefore seek \n2 injunctive relief on behalf of themselves and the class of similarly situated individuals. \n3 COUNT SIX โ Violation of Statutory Duties \n(Penal Code ยง4030) \n4\n(Against Defendants County and LASD Only) \n5\n131. The unnecessary, demeaning, outrageous, and intrusive strip and body cavity \n6\nsearches, to which Plaintiffs and the class members were subjected by Defendants,  \n7\n8 violated Plaintiffsโ and the class membersโ state-law protections guaranteed by California \n9 Penal Code ยง4030. The aforementioned acts of Defendants directly and proximately \n10\ncaused the Plaintiffs and the class members to be deprived of their rights as stated above, \n11\nthereby entitling Plaintiffs and class members to recover damages proximately caused by \n12\nDefendantsโ wrongful acts, including statutory damages under Penal Code ยง4030.\n13\n132. Plaintiffs Lora Barranca, Diana Paiz and Diane Vigil remain incarcerated at \n14\nCRDF, and will remain incarcerated beyond their upcoming court appearances. Because \n15\nCRDF will require them to submit to strip searches/body cavity searches upon  returning \n16\nfrom court, they will continue to suffer deprivations of their rights and, therefore, seek \n17\ninjunctive relief on behalf of themselves and the class of similarly situated individuals. \n18\nCOUNT SEVEN โ Violation of Mandatory Duties \n19\n(Against Defendants County and LASD) \n20\n133. The Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \n21\nConstitution; Article I, ยงยง1, 7, 13, and 17, of the California state constitution; California \n22\nPenal Code ยง4030; and California Civil Code ยง52.1 are enactments. Enactments form the \n23\nbasis of a mandatory duty under California Government Code ยง815.6. \n24\n134. Any California constitutional provision is mandatory and prohibitory, per \n25\nArticle 1, ยง26, of the California Constitution. \n26\n135. These constitutional provisions and statutes apply to all members of the \n27\ngeneral public, including Plaintiffs, and were all designed to prevent the kind of injuries \n28\nalleged herein. \n28\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 30 of 31   Page ID\n #:12030\n1 136.  Defendants did not exercise reasonable diligence in discharging their duty \n2 to refrain from violating the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs and class members. \n3 137.  As a direct and proximate cause of the aforementioned acts of Defendants,\n4 Plaintiffs and class members were damaged in amounts to be determined at trial. \n5 VII.    PRAYER \n6   WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and the class members they \n7\nrepresent, request damages against each defendant as follows: \n8\n1.  General and special damages according to proof; \n9\n2. As against the individual Defendants only, punitive damages according to \n10\nproof; \n11\n3.  In addition to actual damages, statutory damages as allowed by law, \n12\nincluding Penal Code ยง4030 and treble damages under California Civil Code ยงยง52 and \n13\n52.1; \n14\n15 4.  Attorneysโ fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. ยง1988; California Civil Code\n16 ยงยง52(b)(3), 52.1(h); California Code of Civil Procedure ยง1021.5, and whatever other \n17\nstatute or law may be applicable. (Although a claim for injunctive relief is not included in \n18\nthis Amended Complaint, it was in the previous ones. At the time Plaintiffs filed their \n19\nnon-opposition to summary judgment on the grounds of mootness for injunctive relief, \n20\nthey specifically reserved the right to move for catalyst attorneysโ fees on state law \n21\ninjunctive relief claims because they maintain this lawsuit was a substantial factor \n22\ncontributing to defendantsโ action. Thus, a claim for such catalyst fees is included in this \n23\namended complaint, and a motion, and evidence in support thereof, will be brought at the \n24\n25 appropriate time.). \n26 5. The costs of this suit and such other relief as is just and proper. \n27\n28\nDATED: December 15, 2016  KAYE, McLANE, BEDNARSKI & LITT, LLP \n          DONALD COOK \n29\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 334   Filed 12/19/16   Page 31 of 31   Page ID\n #:12031\n1           LAW OFFICES OF CYNTHIA ANDERSON-BARKER \n2\n          By: _/s/  Barrett S.

CLASS DEFINITION \n \n2\nA significant policy change occurred in July, 2011, that creates a substantial distinction \nbetween the women searched from March, 2008โJuly, 2011, and from July, 2011โJanuary 1, \n3\n2015. In July, 2011, some guards stopped the common policy of searching both lines of inmates \n4 simultaneously. Dkt. 321 at 17. This Court believes whether the lines were searched \nsimultaneously or one-at-a-time creates a critically different analysis for liability. The Court does \n5 not find Plaintiffโs proposed class structure satisfactory because it overlaps these time periods \ndespite the change in conditions. Thus, this Court will certify two distinct classes: (1) March, \n6\n2008 โ July, 2011 โSimultaneous search classโ, (2) July, 2011 โ January 1, 2015 โOne-line-at-a-\ntime search classโ. \n7\n \n8 A.  CLASS #1: SIMULTANEOUS SEARCH CLASS, MARCH, 2008โJULY, \n2011 \n9\n \nThe events common to this class are that two lines of women were searched in Bus Bay \n10\n#3, against opposite walls, and directed to face each other. The groups ranged upwards of 60 \nwomen. They were told to undress and a guard would search their exposed top half, including \n11\nunderneath breasts, armpits, and rolls of fat. During this time, the female on the opposite wall \n12 was facing forward, viewing the search occurring. Similarly, each female had to watch while this \nsearch was done to the person across from them and be exposed to that femaleโs private body \n13\nparts. There was also nothing preventing the women from viewing searches to their left and \nright. \n14\n \n15 After the search of the upper part of the body, the visual body cavity (โvbcโ) inspection \noccurred. In this inspection, the women were instructed to remove their underwear, turn around, \n16 bend at the waist, and look through their legs during this search. The women were ordered to \nmanually spread their labia to expose their vaginal opening. Both lines did this at the same time, \n17\nso that the women would view the female across from them in the same position, with their \ngenitals exposed.  \n18\n \n19 When the women undressed, the clothes were placed directly on the ground. The women \nwere barefoot on a porous, concrete slab. \n20  \n1.  Weather Subclass \n21\n \nThis subclass will include women in class #1 who were also subjected to temperatures of \n22\n77 degrees or lower. \n23  \n2.  Menstruation Subclass \n24  \nThis subclass will include women in class #1 who were menstruating at the time the \n25\nsearch occurred. There were additional policies targeted towards menstruating women: in front \nof the group they would be ordered to (1) self-identify that they were currently menstruating, (2) \n26\nremove their tampon or sanitary pad, and (3) insert a new one. \n27  \n28\n2 \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 327   Filed 11/18/16   Page 3 of 8   Page ID #:11919\n \n1 B.  CLASS #2: ONE-LINE-AT-A-TIME SEARCH CLASS, JULY, 2011 โ \nJANUARY 1, 2015 \n2\n \nThe events common to this class are that two lines of women were searched in Bus Bay \n3\n#3, against opposite walls, and directed to face the wall. The group size was limited to 24 women \n4 at a time (except for the subclass, noted below). Then, one line at a time would face forward and \nundress. Opposite them would be a female facing the wall so that no female would directly view \n5 the female across from themโexcept their backside. There was nothing preventing the women \nfrom viewing searches to their left and right. \n6\n \nThe search itself was essentially the same (checking underneath breasts, armpits, and \n7\nrolls of fat). The vbc inspection was also one line at a time and otherwise essentially the same \n8 (women were told to face the wall, bend at the waist, manually spread their labia, and look \nbetween their legs). During the vbc inspection the women would not be viewing the female \n9\nacross from them in the same position, rather the female across from them would be facing the \nwall. \n10\n \nThe women placed their clothes on tables (except for the subclass, noted below). They \n11\nwere barefoot on a porous, concrete slab. \n12  \n1.  Clothes and Group Size Subclass \n13\n \nWomen in class #2 who were searched between July 2011 โ March 2013 had the \n14\nfollowing common conditions between them: (1) searched in groups upwards of 60, and (2) \n15 clothes were put directly on the floor. \n \n16 2.  Weather Subclass \n \n17\nThis subclass will include women in class #2 who were also subjected to temperatures of \n77 degrees or lower. \n18\n \n19 3.  Menstruation Subclass \n \n20 This subclass will include women in class #2 who were menstruating at the time the \nsearch occurred. There were additional policies targeted towards menstruating women: in front \n21\nof the group they would be ordered to (1) self-identify that they were currently menstruating, (2) \nremove their tampon or sanitary pad, and (3) insert a new one. \n22\n \n23 III. LEGAL STANDARD \n \n24 A party seeking class certification must satisfy two requirements.  See Zinser v. Accufix \nResearch Inst., Inc., 253 F.3d 1180, 1186 (9th Cir. 2001), amended by 273 F.3d 1266 (9th Cir. \n25\n2001). First, the moving party must show that the proposed class meets four criteria: (1) the \nmembers of the proposed class must be so numerous that joinder of all claims would be \n26\nimpracticable (โnumerosityโ); (2) there must be questions of law and fact common to the class \n27 (โcommonalityโ); (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties must be typical of the \n28\n3 \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 327   Filed 11/18/16   Page 4 of 8   Page ID #:11920\n \n1 claims or defenses of absent class members (โtypicalityโ); and (4) the representative parties must \nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class (โadequacyโ). Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).   \n2\n        \n  Second, the moving party must demonstrate that the Class fulfills the conditions of at \n3\nleast one of the three subdivisions of Rule 23(b). To qualify for certification under Rule 23(b)(3) \n4 this subsection, a class must satisfy two conditions: (1) common questions of law or fact must \nโpredominate over any questions affecting only individual members,โ and (2) class resolution \n5 must be โsuperior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the \ncontroversy.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). โThe party seeking certification bears the burden of \n6\nshowing that each of the four requirements of Rule 23(a) and at least one requirement of Rule \n23(b) have been met.โ Zinser, 253 F.3d at 1186.   \n7\n \n8 When appropriate, the Court may also certify a class as to a particular issue. Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23(c)(4). Although โcourts and commentators are sharply split on when issue certification is \n9\nproper,โ the Ninth Circuit endorses 23(c)(4) liability classes. 2 William Rubenstein, et al., \nNewberg on Class Actions ยง 4:91 381-82 (citing Valentino v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 97 F.3d 1227 \n10\n(9th Cir. 1996)); see also Jiminez v. Allstate Ins. Co.,765 F.3d 1161, 1166-69 (9th Cir. 2014). A \ncourt may also create subclasses, each of which is treated as a class and subject to the same \n11\nrequirements as one. Betts v. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 659 F.2d 1000, 1005 (9th Cir. \n12 1981).  \n \n13\nA party seeking to certify a class may not merely rest on his pleadings. Rather, โ[a] party \nseeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with the Ruleโthat is, \n14\nhe must be prepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common \n15 questions of law or fact, etc.โ  WalโMart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011) \n(emphasis added).  Thus, a trial court is expected to engage in โrigorous analysisโ to determine if \n16 the moving party has discharged its burden. WalโMart, 564 U.S. at 350โ51 (internal citations \nomitted).  This analysis often โwill entail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiffโs \n17\nunderlying claim.โ  Id. at 351. \n \n18\nIV. DISCUSSION \n19  \nA.  RULE 23(a) REQUIREMENTS \n20  \nThe Defendants do not dispute the elements of numerosity, typicality, and adequacy. As \n21\nfor commonality, the parties dispute whether certain aspects of the search are sufficiently \ncommon among all class members.  \n22\n \n23 1.  Numerosity \n \n24 The exact number of the class is unknown, but is estimated to be in the tens of thousands. \nSee dkt. 284-34, Kriegler Declaration. This Court agrees that a class which expands seven years \n25\nin which hundreds of women were strip searched each month constitutes a class โso numerous \nthat joinder of all members is impracticable.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). \n26\n \n27 2.  Typicality \n \n28\n4 \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 327   Filed 11/18/16   Page 5 of 8   Page ID #:11921\n \n1 โ[R]epresentative claims are โtypicalโ if they are reasonably co-extensive with those of \nabsent class members; they need not be substantially identical.โ Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 \n2\nF.3d 1011, 1020 (9th Cir. 1998). The named Plaintiffs are typical representatives of Class #1 \nsince they were searched between March, 2008 โ July, 2011 and were subjected to the same \n3\npolicies that the class is challenging. Furthermore, at least one of the named Plaintiffs is typical \n4 of each subclass. See, e.g., dkt. 284-42, Cholewiak Decl. ยถ 24 (searched while menstruating), dkt. \n284-52, Madrid Decl. ยถยถ 17, 22 (searched while menstruating; searched in cold conditions). \n5  \nThe Court recognizes that by creating two primary classes the Plaintiffs are left without a \n6\nnamed representative of Class #2, or any of those subclasses, since none of the named Plaintiffs \nstate in their declaration that they were searched between July, 2011 โ January 1, 2015. See \n7\nattachments to dkt. 284. Thus, this Court will allow Plaintiffs fourteen (14) days to amend the \n8 pleadings to cure this defect and add name Plaintiffs to represent this class if able. \n \n9\n3.  Adequacy \n \n10\nโThe Ninth Circuit has held that representation is โadequateโ when counsel for the class is \nqualified and competent, the representative's interests are not antagonistic to the interests of \n11\nabsent class members, and it is unlikely that the action is collusive.โ Fragala v. 500.com, 2015 \n12 WL 12513580, *9 (C.D. Cal. 2015) (citing In re Northern Dist. Of Cal., Dalkon Shield IUD \nProd. Liab. Litig., 693 F. 2d 847, 855 (9th Cir. 1982)). Further, โthe class representative must \n13\nhave a sufficient interest in the outcome of the case to ensure vigorous advocacy.โ Fragala, 2015 \nWL 12513580 at *9 (citing Riordan v. Smith Barney, 113 F.R.D. 60, 64 (N.D. Ill. 1986)). \n14\n \n15 Defendants do not contest the adequacy of the named Plaintiffs or Plaintiffsโ counsel. The \nCourt finds that the named Plaintiffs have sufficiently participated in these proceedings and have \n16 shown a willingness for vigorous advocacy. Further, the Court finds that Plaintiffsโ counsel is \nqualified, competent, and adequate to represent the class and has already shown a willingness to \n17\ndo so vigorously over the past six years. There are no interests antagonistic to absent class \nmembers. \n18\n \n19 As stated above, the Court recognizes there are no adequate named Plaintiffs for Class \n#2, or corresponding subclasses, and reiterate that the Plaintiffs have an opportunity to amend the \n20 pleadings accordingly. \n \n21\n4.  Commonality \n \n22\nโ[I]n a civil-rights suit, . . . commonality is satisfied where the lawsuit challenges a \n23 system-wide practice or policy that affects all of the putative class members.โ Armstrong v. \nDavis, 275 F.3d 849, 868 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing LaDuke v. Nelson, 762 F.2d 1318 (9th Cir. \n24 1985), abrogated on other grounds by Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, 504-05 (2005)). \n \n25\nSeveral of the elements included in the class definitions above have previously been \nfound by this Court to satisfy the commonality requirements. The standard policy of the search \n26\nwas common to all class members: they would be placed in groups, ordered to line up, and strip \n27 searched without any individual privacy. This was the policy of the CRDF and thus commonality \nis satisfied. \n28\n5 \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 327   Filed 11/18/16   Page 6 of 8   Page ID #:11922\n \n1  \nSome aspects, however, are in dispute. Plaintiffs again ask this Court to include โoutdoor \n2\nconditionsโ in the class definition, which is simply a relabeling of their previously dismissed \nrequest to include unsanitary conditions. This Court does not find the existence of birds, bird \n3\nfeathers, ants, or bus fumes to be common enough to be included in the class. Plaintiffs argue \n4 that whether an inmate โpersonally experienced insects or birds during a given search goes to \ninjury and damages, not liability for a class wide practice.โ Dkt. 321 at 24. This is incorrect. The \n5 jury question is whether the policies common to each search were unreasonable. This inquiry \ntakes into account the totality of circumstances. Thus, a jury could find that the common policies \n6\nset forth in the class definition are constitutional, but that an individual female breathing in bus \nfumes (or being subjected to ants and birds) makes that individualโs search unconstitutional. \n7\nSince each element not included in a common policy could affect liability, there would be no \n8 common answer to โwas my search unreasonable?โ if these elements were included in the class \ndefinition. \n9\n \nSimilarly, the policies towards menstruating women do not apply to the class as a whole. \n10\nPlaintiffs rely on Torres v. Mercer Canyons Inc., 835 F.3d 1125 (9th Cir. 2016). In that case a \nfarm operator withheld information from employees on the availability and pay rate of H-2A \n11\nwork in violation of migrant workers protection laws. Id. at 1130. Defendants argued there was \n12 no commonality because some workers would not have benefited from this information and thus \nwere not injured by the policy. Id. at 1136. The Ninth Circuit held this does not defeat \n13\ncommonality because they were all subjected to the same policy, despite the variance in injury. \nId. This case is distinguishable from Torres. The issue is not just that some women were \n14\nuninjured from the policies surrounding menstruation, but that non-menstruating women were \n15 never even subjected to this policy. If a female was not menstruating they did not remove their \ntampon/sanitary pad and replace it. This is not just an issue of injury or damages, but goes \n16 straight to liability. A reasonable jury could find that the group strip searches were constitutional \nin general, but that the extra policies applied to menstruating women make their searches \n17\nunconstitutional. Thus, again, there would be no common answer to the question โwas my search \nunreasonable?โ However, each woman who was searched while menstruating was subjected to \n18\nthe same policies and thus would have a common answer to a common question. Thus, this Court \n19 certifies a subclass for these women.1 \n \n20 Lastly, there is a subclass for women who experienced temperature at or below 77 \ndegrees Fahrenheitโthe temperature requested by Plaintiffs.2 See dkt. 321 at 18. If further \n21\nevidence comes forth suggesting a different temperature is more appropriate, the Plaintiffs can \npetition the Court to amend the class definition accordingly. However, the Court does not believe \n22\nit would be manageable to present evidence to a jury of the deleterious effects of several \n23 different temperatures and let them decide which temperature, if any, is too cold to conduct a \nreasonable strip search. One temperature will be given to the jury and the jury can return a \n24 common answer for all women searched below that temperature of whether it was unreasonably \ncold or not. \n25\n \n26                                            \n1 Further, the Court is satisfied that women can self-identify via an affidavit as menstruating during the time of the \n27 search, as did the named Plaintiffs in this case.  \n2 As is true with any issue, Defendants may be able to introduce evidence that the weather on any given day cannot \n28 be reliably ascertained. The Court does not decide on that issue here. \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 327   Filed 11/18/16   Page 7 of 8   Page ID #:11923\n \n1 B.  RULE 23(b)(3) REQUIREMENTS \n \n2\nTo certify a class under Rule 23(b)(3) the Plaintiff must show that common questions of \nfact or law predominate over individual issues, and that a class action is the superior method to \n3\nadjudicate the controversy. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). \n4  \n1.  Predominance \n5\n \nโThe Rule 23(b)(3) predominance inquiry asks the court to make a global determination \n6\nof whether common questions prevail over individualized ones.โ Torres, 835 F.3d 1125 at 1134. \nโ[A] common question is one where the same evidence will suffice for each member to make a \n7\nprima facie showing [or] the issue is susceptible to generalized, class-wide proof.โ Id. (internal \n8 citations and quotation marks omitted). Further, โmore important questions apt to drive the \nresolution of the litigation are given more weight in the predominance analysis over \n9\nindividualized questions which are of considerably less significance to the claims of the class.โ \nId. \n10\n \nThis Court finds the question of whether the underlying CRDF policies of strip searching \n11\nfemale inmates in groups and without individualized privacy to be the predominant inquiry for \n12 purposes of the Rule 23(c)(4) Damages Class. While individual differences in search conditions \noccurred, such as the use of vulgar language by prison guards, unsanitary conditions, etc. The \n13\ngravamen of the class claim is that the policiesโtargeted against the entire classโare \nunconstitutional. Defendants argue that the Court โwould be required to make an individualized \n14\ninquiry into the search-related circumstances of ever class member to determine the merits of \n15 each claim.โ Dkt. 323 at 21. This is incorrect. As a class certified under Rule 23(c)(4), all that \nwill need to occur is a description of the policies common to each class, as set forth above, and \n16 then the jury can provide a common answer that would apply to each class member as to whether \nthese policies were reasonable. \n17\n \n2.  Superiority \n18\n \n19 To establish superiority, the Court must consider:  \n \n20 (A) the class members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution or \ndefense of separate actions; \n21\n(B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already \nbegun by or against class members; \n22\n(C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in \n23 the particular forum; and \n(D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action. \n24  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(A)โ(D). These factors are non-exhaustive. Local Joint Exec. Bd. \n25\nof Culinary/Bartender Trust Fund v. Las Vegas Sands, Inc., 244 F.3d 1152, 1163 (9th \nCir. 2001). Defendants have put forth no argument that individual class members would \n26\nhave an interest in prosecuting this case through separate actions. The Court sees no \n27 reason for this to be the case, and believes the class members would benefit from class \ntreatment. Further, there is no known current litigation already pending by class members \n28\n7 \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 327   Filed 11/18/16   Page 8 of 8   Page ID #:11924\n \n1 on this issue. Concentrating the litigation in this particular forum is highly desirable as all \nthe relevant events took place within the Central District of California. Lastly, though \n2\nmanaging a class of this size and with several subclasses will not be easy, it will also not \nbe unduly difficult. All of the subclasses include additional elements that may make the \n3\nsearch less reasonable, however if a fact-finder finds the elements common to each \n4 primary class to already create a constitutional violation then none of the subclasses need \nto be litigated on the issue of liability. Similarly, the direction of litigation is manageable: \n5 the least problematic policies common to each primary class will be litigated first, and \nthen only if such policies are not found to give rise to a constitutional violation will the \n6\nadditional common elements of each subclass be introduced and litigated. \n \n7\n  Defendants present arguments against superiority that are wholly irrelevant to this \n8 case. They state a Trial by Formula would trample Defendantsโ right to due process and a \nfair trial. Dkt. 323 at 26. There will be no Trial by FormulaโPlaintiffs themselves reject \n9 this idea. Dkt. 325 at 14. It has already been addressed that this is a Rule 23(c)(4) \ndamages class on the issue of liability, and that if Plaintiffs are successful there will be \n10\nindividual damage calculations. Dkt. 262 at 16โ17. \n \n11\nC.  RULE 23(c)(4) REQUIREMENTS \n12  \nThis Court has previously held that โthe efficiency of a single liability determination \n13 regarding the common procedures used by DRDF deputies is sufficient for Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(c)(4). Dkt. 262 at 17. The Court sees no reason, and Defendants provide none, to \n14\nreconsider this determination.  \n \n15\nV.  CONCLUSION \n16  \nIn certifying the class, the Court cannot reach the merits of these constitutional claims. \n17 See Edwards v. First American Corp., 798 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir. 2015). Some, or all, of \nthese allegations may not survive summary judgment. At this point, the Court merely finds that \n18\nthey satisfy the requirements for class certification. For the foregoing reasons, the Court: \n \n19\n1.  GRANTS Plaintiffโs renewed motion for certification under Rule 23(c)(4) and \n20 certifies Class #1 and Class #2, with subclasses, as described above. \n2.  GRANTS Plaintiffs fourteen (14) days to amend the pleadings in order to cure the \n21 defect of having no named Plaintiff to represent Class #2. \n \n22\nIT IS SO ORDERED \n23  \n \n24\nDate: \nNovember 18, 2016\n25  \n   \n26\n            ___________________________________  \n27             HON.

INTRODUCTION \nSeven years ago, Plaintiffs filed this class action complaint alleging that Defendants instigated \nunconstitutional strip search polices at Centmy Regional Detention Facility (\"CRDF\") in Lynwood, \nCalifomia. On November 18, 2016, this Comt granted Plaintiffs' renewed motion for class ce1tification. \nDkt. 327. The class period nms from March 1, 2008 to Janua1y 1, 2015. See id. On December 19, 2016, \nPlaintiffs filed the operative Fomth Amended Complaint. Dkt. 334. On March 10, 2017, the patties filed \ncross motions for sUlillnaty judgment as to Plaintiffs 42 U.S.C  .ยง 1983 claim that Defendants violated the \nFourth Amendment rights of female inmates who were strip searched at Bus Bay #3. Dkts. 343, 346. \nPlaintiffs do not challenge Defendants' right to institute a blanket strip search policy against \ninmates without individualized suspicion, since that issue has long been settled by the Supreme Comi. See \nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979). Plaintiffs ruยทgue that the conditions of the seruยทch, executed \nwithout penological justification, give rise to their ยง 1983 claim.

The Comi agrees, and GRANTS Plaintiffs \nmotion for summruy judgment.1 Accordingly, the Comi DENIES Defendants' motion on these grounds. \nDefendants also moved for smnmruy judgment against the individual and official capacity claims against \nindividual defendants. The Comi GRANTS Defendants' motion for smnmruy judgment on claims against \nindividual defendants. \nII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND2 \nSince 2006, the Los Angeles Cmmty Sheriffs Depruiment (\"LASD\") primruยทily housed the female \ninmates at CRDF. Inmates who ruยทe transp01ied to court are subject to a visual body cavity (\"VBC\") search \nupon their retum to CRDF. The vast majority of these searches occmTed at Bus Bay #3. These seruยทches \nwere conducted in groups of at least twenty inmates, and sometimes exceeding f01iy. \nThough pruticulruยท details of any given strip search may vruy, LASD issued a strip seruยทch script in \n2013 which the pruiies agree describe common elements of the seruยทch from 2008 to 2015. See dkt. 345-1, \nexh. H; dkt. 284-32, exh. 312.1.3 The guards instructed the inmates to disrobe down to their panties, and \nplace their clothes and personal items on a table in front of them. The inmates then lifted their aiiDS above \ntheir head, lifted their breasts, and ran their fingers through the waistline of their unde1wear. They were \nthen told to drop their lmdeiweruยท to their knees and leave them there, and to open their belly buttons and \nlift their stomach and any skin folds. They were then told to lift their lmdeiwear and tmn armmd to face the \nwall. \n1 The Court notes that the \"core conditions\" of the search are common to both classes and all subclasses. Therefore, members of \na subclass that may have experienced even harsher conditions, due to cold weather, menstruation while being searched, larger \ngroup size, or other factors, were all subject to the core conditions and thus the sununary judgment order applies to subclasses \nwithout needing to consider the additional allegations of the subclasses. \n2 Unless othetwise noted, the Court's statement of facts is taken from the undisputed statements in the patties' sepatยทate \nstatements of material facts. See dkts. 350, 354. If the Cowt states a fact was not disputed but the subject of an objection, the \nCowt ovetrules the objection. \n3 The Court notes that the script includes reference to several changes that LASD made throughout the years, such as painting \nsquruยทes on the floor and installing tables for imnates to put their clothes on, and thus is not indicative of evety female imnate's \nexperience. However, the Cowt fmds these differences inconsequential to the liability analysis. \nInitials of Prepruยทer \nPMC \nCIVIL MINUTES-GENERAL  Page2 ofl8 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 361   Filed 06/07/17   Page 3 of 18   Page ID\n #:13866\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \nCase No.  CV 10-01649-SVW-JEM  Date  Jlme 7, 2017 \nTitle  Mary Amador v. Leroy D. Baca, et al. \nAt this point the guards asked if any inmates were on her period. If so, they were instmcted to \nremove their tampon or pad and were given a new pad, but told not to put it on. The guards then ordered \nthe following: \n[P]ull down your undetwear, take a half step back, spread your feet wide, and bend at your \nwaist, not at your knees. Reach behind with your hands, spread open your vagina lips, and \ncough. Look between your legs so you can see when we tell you to get up. Cough until you \nare told to get up. When you are told to get up, face the wall and put your hands behind your \nback. You should not be talking or looking around. \nDkt. 345-1, exh. H; dkt. 284-32, exh. 312.1. Inmates who requested a pad were then told they could put it \non. The guards then searched the clothing on the table, and then the inmates got dressed and exited. \nThe patties do dispute the extent to which the inmates viewed each other during this search. See \ndkt. 350 ~ 41. The Comi accepts Defendants' factual contentions that inmates were \"not forced to watch \nother women\", dkt. 345-3, exh. \"X\" (Cholewiak Depo.) at 398:8-16, and that the deputies stood in the \nmiddle of the room between the two lines patiially obstmcting the view. Defendants produce no evidence, \nhowever, that rebuts Plaintiffs' common sense assertion that the inmates could not avoid seeing each \nother's bruยทe bodies.4 \nThe layout of Bus Bay #3 and the amount of individuals searched at a time changed throughout the \nyeruยทs. The Comi finds some of these changes important to the analysis: \nโข  In April, 2013,24 nmnbered squares were painted on the floor Bus Bay #3. \n4 Defendants' argwnent that inmates were \"instlucted\" not to look at each other is misplaced. First, as a factual matter, this does \nnot contradict the assertion that inmates did see each other's bare bodies both dwing the initial disrobing and dming the VBC \ninspection, and thus that assertion remains nndisputed. See Young v. County of Cook, 616 F.Supp.2d 834,850 n. 9 (N.D. Ill. \n2009) (finding that no reasonable fact fmder could infer that a group of inmates being snip searched without privacy screens \ncould avoid observing other inmates' naked bodies). Second, as a legal matter, the bmden is not on the irunates to fix their gaze \nin a constitutionally approp1-iate manner. Rather, the bmden is on the Defendants to secme the irunates' p1-ivacy- unless there a \npenological pwpose or other justification for not doing so. \nInitials of Prepruยทer \nPMC \nCIVIL MINUTES-GENERAL  Page3 ofl8 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 361   Filed 06/07/17   Page 4 of 18   Page ID\n #:13867\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \nCase No.  CV 10-01649-SVW-JEM  Date  Jlme 7, 2017 \nTitle  Mary Amador v. Leroy D. Baca, et al. \nโข  On July 20, 2013, CDRF implemented a written policy limiting strip searches to a \nmaximum of 24 inmates at a time. \nโข  In October, 2014, a body scanner machine was installed for pmposes of searching inmates. \nSince that time, only inmates who refuse to be body-scanned are suยทip searched. \nโข  24 privacy cmiains were installed in Febmmy, 2015. \nThe pmiicular strip search at issue, a VBC, is considered to be more invasive than a strip search \nthat does not include a body cavity inspection. Fmiher, a VBC in which the female inmate is told to \nmanually spread her vagina for inspection (\"labia lift\") is more invasive than the altemative \n\"squat-and-cough\" procedme. It is undisputed that the semยทch conducted by LASD is not the standmยทd \npractice used by other conectional facilities. See dkt. 350 ~~ 113, 116 (Defendants object but do not \ndispute). Plaintiffs expeti, Wendy Still, is not awmยทe of any other jail that conducts this type of invasive \nsearch in a group setting without individualized privacy (regardless of whether the jail uses the \"labia lift\" \nor \"squat-and-cough\" procedme). !d. ~ 117 (Defendants object but do not dispute).5 \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nSunnnaty judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving \npmiy is entitled to judgment as a matter oflaw. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c ). The moving patiy bears the initial \n5 Defendants' objections to these last tv.ro points is that \"conยทectional practices of another institution are i.ITelevant to a \ndetennination of whether the strip search procedmes at CRDF, specifically, were constitutional.\" Dkt. 350 ~~ 116, 117. As \ndiscussed fmiher below, the question is not simply whether or not the strip search \"infringes\" the constitutional rights of \nPlaintiffs, but also whether the infringing elements of the search are reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest. See \nBell, 441 U.S. at 547 (\"[E]ven when an institutional restriction infringes a specific constitutional guarantee ... the practice \nmust be evaluated in the light of the central objective of prison administration, safeguarding institutional secmity. \"); see also \nTurner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987) (\"[W]hen a prison regulation impinges on inmates' constitutional rights, the regulation \nis valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\"). Comts have consistently found the practice of other \ninstitutions to be relevant under the second inquily (whether the infringing element is reasonably related to a valid penological \npurpose). See Monยทtson v. Hall, 261 F.3d 896, 905 (9th Cir. 2001); see also, dkt. 356, Pl. Reply, at n. 4 (collecting cases). \nThe Comt futther notes that Defendants' objections to Wendy Still are targeted towards her lack of personal \nknowledge of CRDF. See dkt. 355, Def. Reply, at 10. Defendants do not object to her knowledge of standard practices at other \nconectional facilities. Fmiher, Defendants have not challenged Still's qualifications as an expe1t and have not requested a \nDaubert hearing. \nInitials of Prepmยทer \nPMC \nCIVIL MINUTES-GENERAL  Page4 ofl8 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 361   Filed 06/07/17   Page 5 of 18   Page ID\n #:13868\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \nCase No.  CV 10-01649-SVW-JEM  Date  Jlme 7, 2017 \nTitle  Mary Amador v.

Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987), the Supreme Comi considered the constitutionality of \nseveral inmate regulations promulgated by the Missouri Division of Conections. The Comi began by \ndescribing \"the principles that necessruยทily frame our analysis of prisoners' constitutional claims.\" !d. at \n84. Among other things, the Court observed: \n[C]omis  are  ill  equipped to  deal  with  the  increasingly  urgent  problems  of prison \nadministration and refonn.  . . . [T]he problems of prisons in America ruยทe complex and \nintractable, and, more to the point, they ruยทe not readily susceptible of resolution by decree. \nRmming a prison is an inordinately difficult undertaking that requires expertise, planning, \nand the commitment of resources, all of which are peculiruยทly within the province of the \nlegislative and executive branches of govemment.  . . . Where a state penal system is \ninvolved, federal courts have, as we indicated in Mruiinez, additional reason to accord \ndeference to the appropriate prison authorities. \n!d.

Leroy D. Baca, et al. \n[J]udgments regarding prison security are peculiarly within the province and professional \nexpertise of conections officials, and, in the absence of substantial evidence in the record \nto indicate that the officials have exaggerated their response to these considerations, comis \nshould ordinarily defer to their expe1i judgment in such matters. \n!d. at 86 (intemal citations and quotation marks omitted). \nIn light of these guiding principles, the Comi held that \"when a prison regulation impinges on \ninmates' constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological \ninterests.\" !d. at 89. Specifically, the Turner Comi listed four factors in detennining the reasonableness of \nthe regulation at issue. \"First, there must be a valid, rational connection between the prison regulation and \nthe legitimate govemmental interest put f01ward to justify it.\" !d. at 89 (intemal quotation marks omitted). \nSecond, courts should consider \"whether there are altemative means of exercising the right that remain \nopen to prison inmates.\" !d. at 90. \"A third consideration is the impact accommodation of the asse1ied \nconstitutional right will have on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources \ngenerally.\" !d. \"Finally, the absence of ready altematives is evidence of the reasonableness of a prison \nregulation. By the same token, the existence of obvious, easy altematives may be evidence that the \nregulation is not reasonable, but is an 'exaggerated response' to prison concems.\" Id.6 \nB.  Bell v. Wolfish \nIn Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), the Supreme Comi held that conducting a visual body \ncavity search of all inmates who had a conta.ct visit with visitors, without probable cause to believe the \ninmates were concealing contraband, was constitutional. In its decision, the Court set f01ih the applicable \nlegal framework that must be applied where, as here, an inmate challenges a strip-search policy lmder the \nFomih Amendment: \n6 The Cowt cautioned that \"[t]his is not a 'least restrictive altemative' test: prison officials do not have to set up and then shoot \ndown eve1y conceivable altemative method of accommodating the claimant's constitutional complaint. But if an inmate \nclaimant can point to an altemative that fully accommodates the prisoner's rights at de minimis cost to valid penological \ninterests, a cowt may consider that as evidence that the regulation does not satisfy the reasonable relationship standard.\" \nTurner, 482 U.S. at 90-91 (intemal citations omitted). \nInitials of Preparer \nPMC \nCIVIL MINUTES-GENERAL  Page6 ofl8 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 361   Filed 06/07/17   Page 7 of 18   Page ID\n #:13870\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \nCase No.  CV 10-01649-SVW-JEM  Date  Jlme 7, 2017 \nTitle  Mary Amador v. Leroy D. Baca, et al. \nThe  test of reasonableness  lmder  the  Fomih Amendment  is  not  capable  of precise \ndefinition or mechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the \npruticular search against the invasion of personal rights that the seruยทch entails. Comis must \nconsider the scope of the pruticulruยท intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the \njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted. \n!d. at 559. The Comi concluded that VBC inspections could be conducted with less than probable cause, \nbut specifically reaffmned that such seruยทches \"must be conducted in a reasonable mrumer.\" !d. at 560. \nC. Bull v. City & County ofS an Francisco and Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders \nIn Bull v. City & County ofS an Francisco, 595 F.3d 964 (9th Cir. 2010) (en bane), an en bane \npanel of the Ninth Circuit held that the VBC inspection of pre-anaignment anestees, without any \nindividualized reasonable suspicion that they were concealing conuยทaband, was constitutional. \nThe comi reasoned that \"[b ]ecause the pmpose of the seruยทch policy at issue was to fmiher \ninstitutional secmity goals within a detention facility, the principles ruticulated in Bell v. Wolfish [cite], \nand Turner v. Safley [cite], govem om analysis.\" !d. at 971. The comt fmther noted that \"[a]lthoughBell \ncontinues to provide definitive guidance for analyzing detention-facility strip searches under the Fomth \nAmendment, Turner v. Safley is also relevant to om analysis.\" !d. at 973. The comi emphasized the \nsubstantial deference that must be given to prison officials in this context, reiterating that \neven if we \"disagree[] with the judgment of [c onections] officials about the extent of the \nsecmity interests affected and the means required to fmther those interests,\" Bell, 441 U.S. \nat 554, we may not engage in \"an impermissible substitution of [om] view on the proper \nadminisuยทation of [a conections facility] for that of the experienced adminisuยทators of that \nfacility.\" Block, 468 U.S. at 589. \n!d. at 975. Under this deferential standatยทd, the comi found that the suspicionless VBC inspection of \ninmates was constitutional under both Bell and Turner. Sh01tly after the Ninth Circuit's decision in Bull, \nthe Supreme Comi reached essentially the same result in Florence v. Bd. ofC  hosen Freeholders, 566 U.S. \nInitials of Prepruยทer \nPMC \nCIVIL MINUTES-GENERAL  Page 7 ofl8 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 361   Filed 06/07/17   Page 8 of 18   Page ID\n #:13871\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \nCase No.  CV 10-01649-SVW-JEM  Date  Jlme 7, 2017 \nTitle  Mary Amador v. Leroy D. Baca, et al. \n318 (2012), upholding the constitutionality of visual body cavity searches, without reasonable suspicion, \nof inmates entering the general population of a jail. In so holding, the Comi reaffmned the deference owed \nto conections officials in this context: \nIn addressing this type of constitutional claim comis must defer to the judgment of \nconectional officials unless the record contains substantial evidence showing their policies \nare an mmecessruy or lmjustified response to problems ofj ail security. \n!d. at 322-23. However, the Comi acknowledged that \"there may be legitimate concems\" about the \nmanner in which strip searches ruยทe conducted, but found that \"[t]hese issues ruยทe not implicated on the facts \nof this case\". See id. at 339. \nV.  ANALYSIS \nThe Bell Comi put f01ih four factors to analyze the reasonableness of a pruiiculruยท search: \"Comis \nmust consider [A] the scope of the patiicular intrusion, [B] the manner in which it is conducted, [C] the \njustification for initiating it, and [D] the place in which it is conducted.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. The factors \nin Turner ruยทe also relevant to the analysis. See Bull595 F.3d at 973. Thus, the Court will also consider \nwhether there is a \"valid, rational connection between the prison regulation and the legitimate \ngovemmental interest put f01wruยทd to justify it\"; \"the impact accornmodation of the asseried constitutional \nright will have on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources generally\"; and \"the \nabsence [or existence] of ready altematives.\" Turner, 482 U.S. at 89. \nA.  The Scope of the Intrusion \nThe VBC inspections in this case involved no touching by jail personnel and were only conducted \nby female conectional officers. Similar strip seruยทches have been held constitutionally permissible by the \nNinth Circuit and Supreme Court. See, e.g., Florence, 566 U.S. 318 (2012); Bull, 595 F.3d 964 (9th Cir. \n2010) (en bane). The Court notes, however, that Florence specifically dealt with a \"squat-and-cough\" \ninspection. See Florence, 566 U.S. at 324. It is not cleruยท what type of inspection was at issue in Bull, likely \nbecause the district comi decided that the details of the suยทip search were inconsequential to the analysis of \nwhether a blanket suยทip seruยทch policy without individualized suspicion was constitutional. See Bull v. City \nInitials of Prepruยทer \nPMC \nCIVIL MINUTES-GENERAL  Page8 ofl8 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 361   Filed 06/07/17   Page 9 of 18   Page ID\n #:13872\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \nCase No.  CV 10-01649-SVW-JEM  Date  Jlme 7, 2017 \nTitle  Mary Amador v. Leroy D. Baca, et al. \n& Cty. ofS an Francisco, No. C 03-01840 CRB, 2006 WL 449148, at *1 n. 2 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 23, 2006) \n(noting a \"spectnnn of possible search practices\" but fmding \"the distinctions ... of searches make no \ndifference in the analysis.\"). The Supreme Court in Bell briefly described the procedure for males, but was \nmore ambiguous as to the procedure for females. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 558 n. 39 (\"If the inmate is a male, \nhe must lift his genitals and bend over to spread his buttocks for visual inspection. The vaginal and anal \ncavities of female inmates also are visually inspected.\"). \nAs Defendants point out, the search at issue here seems similar to Bell and further similar to the \nsearch this Court reviewed in Solis v. Baca, Case No. CV 06-1135 SCW(CTx) (\"Solis\"). Defendants note \nthat this more invasive f01m of a VBC inspection did not change the constitutional analysis in those cases. \nThe Comt agrees that the difference between the \"labia lift\" and \"squat-and-cough\" searches is not \nconstitutionally significant on its own; however, when accessing the overall reasonableness, this \ndifference should be taken into accmmt. As this Court ftnther notes, Defendants provide no reason why \nthey used a \"labia lift\" procedure instead of \"squat-and-cough\" and do not dispute that the \"labia lift\" is \nnot standard practice at conectional facilities. The Comt must consider, under Turner, the existence of \nready altematives and the impact to the Defendants in instituting these altematives. Here, the \n\"squat-and-cough\" was undeniably a ready altemative and undeniably less invasive, and Defendants fail \nto provide any reason for failing to use this approach and fail to state any negative impact that would result \nfrom this altemative. \nThe scope of the intrusion of the VBC inspection at issue is an imp01tant factor, even if it is \nconstitutionally pe1missible under ce1tain conditions. Thus, this factor alone may not render the search \nunconstitutional, but the use of a highly invasive search is inte1twined with the other factors in an overall \nreasonableness analysis. \nB.  The Manner in Which it is Conducted \nPlaintiffs do not argue that VBC inspections are per se unconstitutional. Nor do they argue that \ngroup stiยทip searches are per se unconstitutional. Rather, the Plaintiffs' claims rely on the manner in which \nthese pruticular VBC inspections were conducted- pruticulruยทly the intmsiveness of the seruยทch combined \nwith the group setting and the lack of individualized privacy. Plaintiffs ruยทgue the pruticulruยท manner of this \nseruยทch was unconstitutionally invasive for the following reasons: \nInitials of Prepruยทer \nPMC \nCIVIL MINUTES-GENERAL  Page9 ofl8 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 361   Filed 06/07/17   Page 10 of 18   Page ID\n #:13873\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \nCase No.  CV 10-01649-SVW-JEM  Date  Jlme 7, 2017 \nTitle  Mary Amador v.

Specifically, the script for the search memorialized in July \n2013 reflects that inmates were told to \"spread open your vagina lips.\" \nโข  They were ordered to look between their legs, not at the wall, so that they could see when an \nofficer signaled them to stand up. \nโข  Fmiher, Plaintiffs argue the intrusiveness is heightened by the lack of privacy, and argue a \nreadily available altemative could have easily accommodated the constitutional enors with \nlittle burden on Defendants. \nBefore the Comi analyzes whether the manner of these patiiculmยท searches were reasonable, the \nComi notes that Defendants' arguments in this regard miss the point. \nDefendants extensively mยทgue that the initiation of the semยทch at issue was reasonable to combat the \nknown contrยทaband problems in jail. However, Plaintiffs concede that it is constitutionally permissible to \nconduct suspicionless strยทip semยทches of all detainees retmning to the prison facility. Thus, Defendants' \nreliance on cases that merely hold group strip searches mยทe not per se ooconstitutional, or that a patiicular \ngroup search--dissimilmยท to the search in this case-was not ooconstitutional, mยทe oopersuasive to this \nComi's inquiiy.

Defendants' strip seruยทch policy is \ndistinguishable from all these cases. \nThe cases Defendants rely on are both distinguishable, and bely Defendants' contention that \nPlaintiffs' \"ready altemative\" arguments are a red hening. Several of these cases at least pruiially base \ntheir decision in analyzing the proffered ready altematives, and ultimately rejecting them for vruยทious \nreasons. See Thompson v.

In Smith the court granted Defendants judgment \non the pleadings because the plaintiff failed to \"allege facts suggesting that the search did not serve a legitimate penological \npurpose.\" 2015 WL 3929621, at *2. In Israel, the court granted defendant's unopposed motion for surmnary judgment fmding \nthe initiation of the strip searches constitutional without analyzing the manner in which they were conducted. 2012 WL \n4762082. In Montgome1y, the court refused to analyze plaintiffs argument that privacy partitions were a readily available \naltemative by explaining that \"the constitutionality of a strip search is not negated by the presence of other inmates and \nemployees of the facility.\" 2013 WL 1982920, at *4.

Male plaintiffs were altematively subject to a \n\"bend-and-spread\" search, in which they would bend over and spread thenยท buttocks, or a \n\"squat-and-cough\" search. !d. at 839. They were searched in large groups without individualized privacy. \n!d. at 840-41.9  Similar to the case before this Comi, the Young plaintiffs likewise \"concede( d) that it is \nproper for (Cook County Jail] to conduct strip searches ... in groups. (However,] (t]hey challenge the \nmanner in which those groups searches were conducted.\" !d. at 850. The Young comi concluded that \n(B]efore the privacy screens were installed ... (the strip searches] were unreasonable and \nviolated the Fomth Amendment as a matter oflaw. Dming that period, the class members, \nwho were undergoing one of the most intmsive types of searches the government may \npermissibly conduct, were subjected to conditions that greatly enhanced their discomf01i \nand hmniliation. They were herded together with dozens of other men and forced to strip \nand bend over or squat in front of a large group, with less than a foot of space between \nthem. \n!d. at 851. \n2015). The comt granted judgment against a prose plaintiff who challenged his strip search in a group by a homosexual male \nguard. Id at *4. The court did not cite Turner nor consider proffered altematives. \n8 If Defendants meant to argue that the search itself does not impinge on Plaintiffs' constitutional rights and therefore does not \ntrigger Turner analysis, this argmnent can be easily dismissed. \"[T]he Fomih Amendment does apply to the invasion of bodily \nprivacy in prisons.\" Bull, 595 F.3d at 974-75 (citing Michenfelder v.

Leroy D. Baca, et al. \nPlaintiffs here also argue that privacy screens should have been installed in Bus Bay #3. They \nargue that, accepting the search itself served a penological pmpose, depriving Plaintiffs of individualized \nprivacy dming \"one of the most intmsive types of searches the govemment may pennissibly conduct\", see \nid., did not serve a penological pmpose nor would it have been too bmdensome to accommodate. \nUltimately, Plaintiff argues that failme to provide such a simple accommodation, with no justification, is \nconclusive evidence that the manner of the strip search was unconstitutional as a matter of law.10 \nThe reasons that Defendants offer for not installing privacy cmtains sooner can be summarized as \nfollows: \nโข  Installing these curtains did not become feasible until the department installed a body scanner \nin October, 2014, because use of the body scanner greatly reduced the number of inmates being \n11 \nstrip searched at any given time. Dkt. 345, Gutienez Decl., ~ 23.\nโข  Privacy cmtains obstmcted a guard's view of inmates. !d. \nโข  The search procedme, as implemented without privacy cmtains, was the most \"cost-effective\" \nmethod of conducting strip searches. !d. at~ 24. \nโข  The search procedme, as implemented without privacy cmtains, posed \"the least ammmt of \nsafety concems\" without compromising the effectiveness of the search. !d. \n10 As an initial matter, this case is distinguishable from the Cowt's previous decision in Solis. In Solis, plaintiffs likewise \noffered pattitions or cwtains as a ready altemative to ameliorate privacy concems. The Cowt rejected this, citing defendants' \nresponse that partitions would cause safety issues and be logistically impractical due to cost concems and the fact they would \nimpede the flow of traffic through the conidor in which the search was conducted. None of these concems are present here. It is \nundisputed that installing the cwtains costs the Defendants less than $8,000, and that the installation was \"simple.\" See dkt. 350 \n~~ 141-43 (noting Defendants' \"dispute\" on other grounds). Fwiher, unlike Solis, the Bus Bay was primarily used to search \ninmates and thus Defendants do not argue the cwtains impede a normal flow of traffic or are otherv.โขise incompatible with the \nspace. Lastly, Defendants point to no \"safety concems\" with the use of privacy cwtains- but instead only conclus01y state, for \nthe first time in their opposition papers via a single paragraph in a declaration by Cmdr. GutietTez, that they considered \"safety \nconcems\" when instituting their overall search procedme. \n11  Defendants provide no explanation- fmancial or logistic- why the body scanner itself could not have been installed earlier. \nSee dkt. 284-38, Still Decl. ~58, exh. 605 (noting that Cook County prisons installed body scanners in 2011). However, this \nissue was not briefed by the patties and thus will not be relied on by this Cowt. \nInitials of Preparer \nPMC \nCIVIL MINUTES-GENERAL  Page 13 of18 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 361   Filed 06/07/17   Page 14 of 18   Page ID\n #:13877\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \nCase No.  CV 10-01649-SVW-JEM  Date  Jlme 7, 2017 \nTitle  Mary Amador v. Leroy D. Baca, et al. \n2.  Analysis \nPrison officials are oodoubtedly afforded great deference in their determinations of how to conduct \nsuยทip searches that serve a legitimate penological pmpose. See Bull, 595 F.3d at 977; Turner, 482 U.S. at \n90. However, this deference is not absolute. Walker v. Sumner, 917 F.2d 382, 385 (9th Cir. 1990) \n(\"[D]eference does not mean abdication.\"). Therefore, comis can reject weak justifications when \ncompared to the significant constitutional rights at issue. See, e.g., Jordan v. Gardener, 986 F.2d 1521, \n1530 (9th Cir. 1993) (in finding that cross-gender clothed pat-down searches violated the Eighth \nAmendment, the comi rejected excuses that males needed to perfonn the search to avoid intem1pting \nlooch periods of female guards. The concmTing opinion analyzed the case ooder the Fourth Amendment \nand applied Turner deference, yet nonetheless foood a constitutional violation and rejected defendants' \n12 \nweak justifications, see id. at 1536, 1538). Fmiher, comis must reject contradict01y evidence, illogical \nproclamations, and proffered justifications oosupported by evidence. See, e.g., Hrdlicka v. Reniff, 631 \nF.3d 1044, 1054-55 (9th Cir. 2011) (noting a \"marked contrast\" between the \"general statements\" offered \nto show a valid penological pmpose and the \"weak\" and \"contradict01y\" evidence offered to supp01i those \nstatements);13 see also Young, 616 F.Supp.2d at 852 (finding defendants' argmnent that privacy pruiitions \nwere not feasible was \"oodennined\" by their later installation and \"use[] without problems\"). This case \ninvolves all of the above. \nDefendant's main contention is that installing privacy cmiains was not feasible ootil they installed \nthe body scrumer since prior to the body scanner they had to seruยทch many more women at any given time \nand thus could not provide cmiains for all of them in the same ammmt of space, as it would have been \nmore difficult to monitor evety woman and would have taken longer. There are several issues with this \nexcuse. The first and most imp01iant issue with this proffered justification is the fact that Defendants \nbegan seruยทching inmates in groups of24 over a yeruยท before the body scrumer was installed. See dkt. 345, \nDe La Tone Decl. ~ 13 (stating that from July 2013 onwruยทd \"[o  ]nly 24 inmates could be seruยทched at one \ntime.\"). For over a year, between July 2013 and October 2014, evety search was conducted with only 24 \n12 The fact that the Jordan majority rested its decision on the Eighth Amendment helps Plaintiffs' argmnent, since an Eighth \nAmendment violation is more difficult to establish than a Fourth Amendment violation. \n13 The Cowt notes that Hrdlicka dealt with a constitutional claim under the First Amendment. However, this Comt fmds no \nreason why Hrdlicka's analysis of Turner in rejecting weak and contradictory justifications would be different in the Fowih \nAmendment context. \nInitials of Prepruยทer \nPMC \nCIVIL MINUTES-GENERAL  Page 14 ofl8 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 361   Filed 06/07/17   Page 15 of 18   Page ID\n #:13878\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \nCase No.  CV 10-01649-SVW-JEM  Date  Jlme 7, 2017 \nTitle  Mary Amador v. Leroy D. Baca, et al. \nwomen present and without a body scanner. Thus, Defendants' own evidence shows that they could- and \ndid- search only 24 inmates at a time before the body scanners were installed. By definition, it was \nfeasible. Defendants do not attempt to explain this discrepancy and give no reason why the privacy \ncmiains could not have been installed at least as early as July 2013.14 Further, if reducing the search group \nsize to 24 women without a body scanner was less efficient and took more time, Defendants should have \nevidence from July 2013 to October 2014 to show this Comi that searches took longer. Yet, Defendants \nproduce no evidence that the searches during this time took longer, were difficult to manage, were unsafe, \nor were othe1wise problematic. See Young, 616 F.Supp.2d at 852. The Comi recognizes that it should give \ngreat deference to the justifications of prison officials. However, accepting this contradict01y justification \nwould create a mle of absolute deference, which no comis has fmmd appropriate. See, e.g., Hrdlicka, 631 \nF.3d at 1054-55 (rejecting general justifications that relied on contradict01y evidence). Deference should \nbe given to \"inf01med\" decisions. See Turner, 482 U.S. at 90. Plaintiffs contend that Defendants failed to \neven consider privacy curtains until recently. See, e.g., dkt. 284-22, Cmdr. Gutienez Dep., exh. 180, \n146:2-25 (\"if that thought [of privacy cmiains] would have come up 20 years ago we wouldn't probably \nbe here today.\"). Defendants do not specifically state when they first considered adding cmiains, but \ninstead simply declare \"[t]he installation of such cmiains, prior to the installation of the body-scanner, was \nnot a viable option.\" See dkt. 276, Hausser Decl., ~ 16. Accepting that Defendants considered and rejected \nprivacy cmiains, there is no basis on which this Court can fmd the decision was \"inf01med\" and thus the \nComi cannot be deferential to this decision. \nThe explanation that these cmiains would obstruct the guard's view of inmates is also lmfounded. \nPrivacy cmiains have been used for over two years prior to this summa1y judgment motion. Yet, \nDefendants provide no real world evidence that the cmiains have unreasonably obsti11cted the guard's \nview of inmates. See dkt. 284-22, Cmdr. Gutienez Dep., exh. 180, 153:4-20 (\"Q: ... [I]n your personal \nopinion, if you had a ratio of three to one and you had had the curtains installed, it would have gone \nfine ... A: I think that an attentive, observant employee is definitely going to be able to do a good job.\"). \nAgain, the Comi cannot give deference to a single conclus01y explanation accompanied with no evidence \nor explanation of potential consequences. \n14 The Cowt also notes that Defendants give no reason why they did not reduce the search group size to 24 women from the \nbegimling of the class period. \nInitials of Preparer \nPMC \nCIVIL MINUTES-GENERAL  Page 15ofl8 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 361   Filed 06/07/17   Page 16 of 18   Page ID\n #:13879\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \nCase No.  CV 10-01649-SVW-JEM  Date  Jlme 7, 2017 \nTitle  Mary Amador v. Leroy D. Baca, et al. \nThe excuse that the search as implemented was the most \"cost-effective\" is belied by the fact that \ninstalling curtains costs lmder $8,000. See dkt. 350 mf 141-43 (noting Defendants' \"dispute\" on other \ngrounds). Certainly it was $8,000 cheaper to not install privacy cmiains, yet this is the epitome of a weak \njustification when compared to the significant constitutional rights at issue. See, e.g., Jordan, 986 F.2d at \n1530. The excuse that the search, before installing cmiains, provided the least amount of safety concems is \nalso lmaccompanied with evidence or explanation as to the consequences. There is no evidence that in the \ntwo years since cmiains have been implemented there has been any safety concems. See Young, 616 \nF.Supp.2d at 852.15 \nThe heali of Defendants' defense cannot be that accommodating Plaintiffs' constitutional rights \nwas not feasible or impractical. They did it. It was feasible. The question, then, is whether Defendants \nwere ignorant of the need to provide such accommodations. However, Defendants cannot reasonably \nargue that they were lmaware of the obvious altemative of privacy cmiains. See, e.g., dkt. 284-22, Cmdr. \nGutienez Dep., exh. 180, 146:2-25 (\"if that thought [of privacy curtains] would have come up 20 years \nago we wouldn't probably be here today.\"). The issue of privacy pruiitions was initially plead and litigated \nin Solis, a case which involved the same Defendants, same defense counsel, and same plaintiff's cmmsel. \nSee Solis, Case No. CV 06-1135 SCW(CTx), dkt. 76 at~~ 70, 72-73 (this document, filed in 2008, \ndiscusses other Califomia jails that use either prutitions or cmiains to provide privacy to inmates being \nstrip seruยทched). Thus, Defendants were well awruยทe of this altemative. See also Still Decl., ~ 61 \n(acknowledging that the Federal Bureau of Prisons installed privacy pruiitions in all of its prisons in \n1987); Young, 616 F.Supp.2d at 852 (finding in 2009 that the nonuse of privacy screens during strip \nsearches without justification was a Fomih Amendment violation). This is not a case where the required \naccommodation was extraordinruy or unreasonable. In this case, the accommodation was obvious, cheap, \nand \"simple\", see dkt. 350 ~ 143, and Defendants knew it was a ready altemative at least as fruยท back as \n2008- two yeruยทs before this case was filed. \n15 Fwther belying Defendants' contention that privacy cmtains were nnfeasible is the fact that Plaintiffs' expe1t, Wendy Still, is \nnnaware of any other jail that conducts invasive strip search without individualized privacy. See dkt. 350 ~ 117. Defendants also \ndo not cite another jail that does so. As noted, see supra n. 5, this fact is relevant to the Comt's analysis as to whether \nDefendants' actions served a penological purpose or were othe1wise justified. Though LASD may have had unique obstacles \nthat prevented them from confonning to the standard practices of other jails, Defendants do not provide evidence that these \nobstacles existed or that CRDF is nnique. \nInitials of Prepruยทer \nPMC \nCIVIL MINUTES-GENERAL  Page 16 of18 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 361   Filed 06/07/17   Page 17 of 18   Page ID\n #:13880\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \nCase No.  CV 10-01649-SVW-JEM  Date  Jlme 7, 2017 \nTitle  Mary Amador v. Leroy D. Baca, et al. \nC.  The Justification for Initiating the Search \nPlaintiffs essentially do not dispute that Defendants are within their right to initiate these searches. \nPlaintiffs do provide evidence, however, that there is minimal justification for the invasive VBC search. \nSee dkt. 156 ~~ 153-59 (noting that Plaintiffs are supervised at all times when at court, are only out of \nhandcuffs when in a holding tank, go through pat down searches at the comt, and othe1wise have minimal \ncontact with the public). However, this Comt accepts Defendants' justification that the searches are \nnecessruy to combat the contraband problem in LASD. See dkt. 345, Gutienez Decl., ~~ 5, 7, 16-21, 24; \nsee also, Anoyo Decl., ~ 13; Diaz Decl., ~ 13; Estrada Decl., ~ 13; Hausser Decl., ~ 13; Ponce Decl., ~ 13; \nShambaugh Decl., ~ 13; Vruยทgas Decl., ~ 13. \nD.  The Place in Which it is Conducted \nThe conditions of Bus Bay #3 ruยทe greatly disputed by the parties. Since the Court is granting \nsunnna1y judgment as to the core conditions, see supra n. 1, the Comt can accept-for pmposes of this \nsumma1y judgment order only-that Bus Bay #3 was a suitable location for the searches. \nE.  Totality of the Circumstances \nBased on the totality of the circmnstances, the Comt concludes that Plaintiffs' Fomth Amendment \nrights were violated. This conclusion is based on the invasiveness of the search (i.e. use of the \"labia lift\" \ndespite less intmsive altematives) , which is one of the most invasive procedures conducted in penological \ninstitutions, the group setting of the seruยทch, in which inmates could not avoid viewing each other, the lack \nof privacy within that group setting, and-most imp01tantly-the lack of a penological pmpose or \ninf01med justification for not providing individualized privacy. There is substantial evidence in the record \nthat the manner of the search was an \"unnecessruy [and] unjustified response to problems of jail security.\" \nFlorence, 566 U.S. at 322-23. \nF.  Conclusion \nThere is no question that Defendants had the right to conduct a VBC search on Plaintiffs. \nHowever, under Turner, Defendants must justify their refusal to adopt ready altematives. They have not \nInitials of Prepruยทer \nPMC \nCIVIL MINUTES-GENERAL  Pagel7ofl8 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 361   Filed 06/07/17   Page 18 of 18   Page ID\n #:13881\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \nCase No.  CV 10-01649-SVW-JEM  Date  Jlme 7, 2017 \nTitle  Mary Amador v.

To \nthe contnuy, the evidence shows that what Defendants claim was not feasible, was in fact feasible, \navailable, and inexpensive. Since there were readily available altematives, with minimal costs of \naccommodation, on this record the Comi GRANTS summary judgment in Plaintiffs' favor. \nVI.  QUALIFIED IMMUNITY \nPlaintiffs' complaint also named eight individual defendants in their personal and official capacity \nwho are cunent or f01mer high-ranking LASD officials. Defendants moved for summaty judgment \nagainst these claims arguing that the official capacity claims are duplicative of the Monell claim against \nthe Cmmty, see Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165-67 (1985) (official capacity suit against an \nindividual defendant is to be treated as a suit against the employing public entity), and that the individual \nclaims should be dismissed due to qualified immlmity. \nPlaintiff did not oppose either of these arguments. The Comi finds a suit against individual \ndefendants in their official capacity for damages is duplicative of a Monell claim, and thus GRANTS \nsummruy judgment against these claims. See id.; see also Paeste v. Gov't ofG  uam, 798 F.3d 1228, 1235-\n6 (9th Cir. 2015) (reiterating that individuals sued in their official-capacity for damages, as opposed to \ninjlmctive relief, ruยทe not \"persons\" within the meaning of ยง 1983). \nAs to the individual capacity claims, the complaint makes no allegations as to the actions these \nindividual defendants engaged in. Defendants state, and Plaintiffs do not dispute, that the individual \ndefendants did not conduct any of the lmconstitutional seruยทches themselves. As to their role in creating the \nseruยทch policy, there ruยทe no allegations as to which defendant created or implemented any aspect of the \npolicy or even which time period these defendants maintained their high-ranking positions within LASD. \nThus, the Comi cannot discem any individual activity in which any of these defendants would be \npersonally liable, and therefore GRANTS smrunruy judgment in their favor. \nAccordingly, the Court GRANTS summruy judgment in favor of Plaintiffs on its Fourth \nAmendment claim and GRANTS smnmruy judgment in favor of the individual Defendants. \nInitials of Prepruยทer \nPMC \nCIVIL MINUTES-GENERAL  Page 18 ofl8 ",

INTRODUCTION \n2  1.  This action concerns the manner in which inmates are searched in Los \n3  Angeles County's jails, alleging, inter alia, violations of the Fourth, Eighth and \n4  Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and their corollaries under the \n5  California Constitution. \n6  2.  The gravamen of this complaint concerns the privacy rights of inmates who \n7  are routinely subjected to strip and body cavity searches in violation of the Constitutions \n8  and laws of the United States and the State of California. \n9  3.  Of particular concern is that female inmates are subjected to degrading strip \n10  and body cavity searches under circumstances and conditions when male inmates are not. \n11  II.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12  4.  Plaintiffs present federal claims for relief under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n13  Accordingly, federal jurisdiction is conferred upon this Court by 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and \n14  13 4 3. Plaintiffs' state law claims are so related to their federal law claims that they form \n15  part of the same case or controversy. Accordingly, supplemental jurisdiction over the \n16  state law claims is conferred upon this Court by 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367. \n17  5.  Plaintiffs' claims arise out of acts of the Los Angeles County Sheriffs \n18  Department in the County of Los Angeles, State of California. Accordingly, venue is \n19  proper within the Central District of California. \n20  III.  PARTIES \n21  A.  PLAINTIFFS \n22 \n6.

Mary Amador was arrested by Los Angeles County Sheriffs personnel on o \n10  about March 1, 2009. She surrendered to a Detective Corrigan in the parking lot of the \n11  Century Regional Detention Facility (hereafter \"CRDF\"), after Detective Corrigan told \n12  advised that she had a welfare fraud warrant for her arrest. CRDF is commonly known \n13  and referred to as the \"Lynwood Jail\".  The detective gave Mrs. Amador a week to \n14  surrender so that she could make arrangements for child care for her young daughter, and \n15  so that she could arrange bail. Mrs. Amador surrendered at 9:00 A.M. Bail had already \n16  been posted. \n17  22.  Mrs. Amador was strip searched at about 6-7 P.M. that evening in a group \n18  with about 12 other women, outside in the open, in cold air, in an area bordered on one \n19  side by a facility wall and entry door, on another by a solid block wall, on the third by a \n20  solid gate, and on the fourth by a chain link fence shielded by a tom and shredded tarp. \n21  She could see about five male deputies on the other side of the tom tarp. The location wa \n22  apparently a driveway, and/or discharge area for buses. \n23  23.  The ground in the area was concrete. The women were required to \n24  completely disrobe, place their street clothes on the ground, squat, spread their buttocks, \n25  lift their breasts, etc., and change into jail attire which they picked up from the ground. \n26  24.  One of the women, about 60 years old, complained bitterly of the cold, and \n27  cried. \n28 \n5 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 6 of 29   Page ID #:1162\n1  25.  Having spent most of the day with four of the women, Mrs. Amador had \n2  learned that they had just been arrested, and had not yet been to court. Mrs. Amador had \n3  not been to court, either. \n4  26.  About an hour after having been strip searched, Mrs. Amador was released \n5  on bail. A jailer told Mrs. Amador that her bail bond had been at the jail since 9:00A.M. \n6  in the morning. \n7  27.  The day after bailing out, Mrs. Amador called the facility to complain about \n8  the strip search. She left a detailed voice mail on the watch commander's extension. She \n9  has never heard back, or received any type of acknowledgement of her complaint.. \n10  28.  Mrs. Amador and the women were searched as a group with each woman \n11  able to, and forced to, watch the other women being searched. They were forced to stand \n12  naked within inches of each other as they were searched. They were forced to place their \n13  clothing on the unsanitary concrete. This is the same concrete Plaintiff and the women \n14  were forced to stand on, barefoot and naked. \n15  D.  LORA BARRANCA \n16  29.  Lora Barranca was arrested by LASD on or about August 28, 2009. She was \n17  transferred to CRDF on September 2nd or 3rct. She remains in custody, and expects to \n18  remain in custody beyond the date ofher next court appearance on September 21,2010. \n19  30.  During the booking process, LASD strip searched/body cavity searched Ms. \n20  Barranca in a large group of women, in an outdoor area used to park buses (hereafter \n21  \"bus stall\"). The women were required to completely disrobe, place their clothes on the \n22  concrete, squat, spread their buttocks, lift their breasts, etc., and change into jail attire, \n23  which they picked up from the concrete. \n24  31.  LASD personnel at CRDF have strip searched/body cavity searched Ms. \n25  Barranca on multiple occasions, including each time she returned from court, or after \n26  visiting the hospital. All strip searches occurred in the bus stall, and in a group setting. \n27  Ms. Barranca will likely be strip searched/body cavity searched, pursuant to LASD \n28  policy, in the same manner and location when she returns from court on September 21, \n2010. \n6 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 7 of 29   Page ID #:1163\n1  32.  Ms. Barranca has been strip searched in groups as large as 50 women. \n2  Deputies told the women to line up on opposite walls, in two lines of 25 women. Each \n3  detainee could watch the other women being searched, and in fact, could not avoid \n4  watching the other women being searched.  During the search, when the women are \n5  naked and facing each other, they can see each other's gang tattoos. I have heard women \n6  at CRDF later discuss which women had a certain kind of gang tattoo. \n7  33.  As the women lined up, the deputies shouted \"shoulder to shoulder,\" forcing \n8  the women to stand so close that their bodies touched at the shoulders. When the deputies \n9  told Ms. Barranca to bend over for the body cavity search, her thighs also touched the \n10  women adjacent to her. \n11  34.  The bus stall entrance is adjacent to the CRDF booking area. In Ms. \n12  Barranca's experience, deputies left the entrance open.  They did not take measures to \n13  block the view of those being strip searched by persons inside the facility. CRDF \n14  personnel, including male personnel, frequently passed the bus stall entrance and could \n15  see the searches taking place. Detainees sitting in a nearby processing area could also \n16  observe the strip searches. \n17  35.  A chain link fence comprises one wall of the bus stall. Ms. Barranca has \n18  been searched in the stall when no tarps or other materials shielded her from the view of \n19  persons outside the stall. The ceiling is also a chain link fence. No tarp covered the \n20  ceiling when Ms. Barranca was initially booked into CRDF. When it drizzles outside, \n21  women in the search area get rained on. \n22  36.  The bus stall is usually very cold in the late afternoon and evening, when \n23  most searches take place. The floor of the bus stall is porous, grey cement. It is dirty. \n24  Sometimes Ms. Barranca could observe trash lying around from previous searches. She \n25  has also observed menstrual blood on the cement, ants on the ground, insects crawling up \n26  the walls, and oil spots where the busses have dripped oil. Ms. Barranca was forced to \n27  place her clothing on the unsanitary cement. \n28 \n7 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 8 of 29   Page ID #:1164\n1  E.  DIANAPAIZ \n2  37.  Diana Paiz was arrested on or about February 12, 2010. She was booked into \n3  CRDF on approximately February 17, 2010. She remains in custody, and expects to \n4  remain in custody beyond the date of her next court appearance on September 23, 2010. \n5  38.  LASD personnel at CRDF have strip searched/body cavity searched Ms. \n6  Paiz approximately 5 times, including each time she returned from court. Each of the \n7  searches occurred with a large group of women in an outdoor bus stall. The women were \n8  required to completely disrobe, place their clothes on the cement, squat, spread their \n9  buttocks, lift their breasts, etc., and change into jail attire which they picked up from the \n10  cement. Ms. Paiz will almost certainly be strip searched/body cavity searched in the same \n11  manner and location when she returns from court on September 23, 2010. \n12  3 9.  Ms. Paiz has been strip searched in groups ranging from 20 to 40 women. \n13  Deputies told the women to line up on opposite walls. Each woman could watch the other \n14  women being searched and, in fact, could not avoid watching the other women being \n15  searched.  As the women lined up, the deputies shouted \"shoulder to shoulder,\" forcing \n16  the women to stand so close that their bodies touched at the shoulders. Deputies told the \n17  women to put their noses on the wall, which is visibly dirty. \n18  40.  The bus stall entrance is adjacent to the CRDF booking area. In Ms. Paiz's \n19  experience, deputies left the entrance open and did not take measures to block the view o \n20  those being searched from persons inside the facility. \n21  41.  The bus stall is usually cold in the late afternoon and evening, when most \n22  searches take place. The concrete is dirty, and sometimes Ms. Paiz could observe trash \n23  lying around from previous searches. During searches, Ms. Paiz was forced to place her \n24  clothing on the unsanitary cement. \n25  42.  Guards routinely gave instructions using abusive and profane language. \n26  After women undressed, the guards laughed at them, making jokes about the appearance \n27  of their bodies and how the area smelled. \n28 \n8 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 9 of 29   Page ID #:1165\n1  43.  Some severely overweight or physically disabled women cannot expose thei \n2  body cavities by bending over. They are subjected to an even less dignified search: the \n3  guards order them to sit or lie on the bare concrete, spread their legs and raise their feet \n4  off the ground. \n5  F.  DIANE VIGIL \n6  44.  Diane Vigil was arrested by LASD on or about May 9, 2010. Ms. Vigil was \n7  transferred to CRDF on May 12, 2010. She remains in custody and expects to remain in \n8  custody beyond the date of her next court appearance on September 28, 2010. \n9  45.  During the booking process, LASD strip searched/body cavity searched Ms. \n10  Vigil with a large group of women, in an outdoor bus stall. The women were required to \n11  completely disrobe, place their clothes on the ground, squat, spread their buttocks, lift \n12  their breasts, etc., and change into jail attire, which they picked up from the cement. Ms. \n13  Vigil began menstruating shortly before she arrived at CDRF for booking, though she did \n14  not realize it until she pulled down her underwear for the body cavity search. She \n15  requested a sanitary napkin, but was chastised for not informing them earlier. Even \n16  though blood was dripping down her leg and onto the ground, she had to wait for a \n17  sanitary napkin until after the body cavity search was finished. \n18  46.  CRDF has strip searched/body cavity searched Ms. Vigil approximately 5 \n19  times, including each time she returned from court. All strip searches occurred in the bus \n20  stall and en masse. Ms. Vigil will almost likely be strip searched/body cavity searched in \n21  the same manner and location when she returns from court on September 23, 2010. \n22  4 7.  Ms. Vigil has been strip searched in groups as large as 50 women. Deputies \n23  told the women to line up on opposite walls. Each woman could watch the other women \n24  being searched and, in fact, could not avoid watching the other women being searched. \n25  As the women lined up, the deputies shouted \"shoulder to shoulder,\" forcing women to \n26  stand so close that their bodies touched at the shoulders. \n27  48.  The bus stall entrance is adjacent to the CRDF booking area. In Ms. Vigil's \n28  experience, deputies left the entrance open and typically did not take measures to block \n9 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 10 of 29   Page ID\n #:1166\n1  the view of those being searched from persons inside the facility. Prior to August 18, \n2  2010, Ms. Vigil had never observed deputies move laundry carts in front of the doors. \n3  49.  The bus stall is usually cold in the late afternoon and evening, when most \n4  searches take place. The cement is dirty and sometimes Ms. Vigil could observe trash \n5  lying around from previous searches. She has also observed menstrual blood on the \n6  cement and ants crawling on the ground. \n7  50.  Guards routinely gave instructions using abusive and profane language. \n8  51.  Some severely overweight or physically disabled women cannot expose thei \n9  body cavities by bending over. They are subjected to an even less dignified search: the \n10  guards order them to sit on the bare concrete, spread their legs and raise their feet off the \n11  ground. \n12  G.  ALISA BATTISTE \n13  52.  Alisa Battiste was arrested by LASD deputies on January 30, 2010 and was \n14  transferred directly to CRD F on January 31, 20 10 , before going to court. Upon \n15  processing into CRDF and each time she came back from court (about 7-8 times), she \n16  was strip and visual body cavity searched outdoors, in a bus stall adjacent to the booking \n17  area. \n18  53.  Each time she was searched, Ms. Battiste and the women being searched \n19  with her were forced to stand close together, strip naked, face the women across from \n20  them, lift their breasts and stomachs, open their mouths, use their fingers to spread their \n21  cheeks (without an opportunity to wash their hands first), tum to face the wall, bend over, \n22  use their hands to spread their buttocks and vaginas, and cough while guards looked into \n23  their body cavities. \n24  54.  Ms. Battiste and the other women then had to lift each foot and wiggle their \n25  toes. Many women would lose their balance attempting to stand on one foot and would \n26  fall over, while naked, and bump into one of the naked women next to them. \n27  55.  If a woman was menstruating, she had to remove her soiled menstrual pad, \n28  or pull out her used tampon while in the group, put it into a box, and then put the box on \n10 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 11 of 29   Page ID\n #:1167\n1  the ground. \n2  56.  The bus stall is connected to the interior of the jail by sliding glass doors \n3  which were always open during the searches. When Ms. Battiste was searched in the bus \n4  stall, inmates were usually chained to the benches just inside the door.  They could see \n5  the searches. Sometimes it was inmates in yellow jump suits whom Ms. Battiste \n6  understood to have mental problems, or were \"5150\". Male deputies and other jail staff \n7  walking by could also see the searches. Although the door was always open, because the \n8  door is made of glass guards and inmates on the other side would be able to see the \n9  searches even if the door were closed. \n10  57.  After the searches, Ms. Battiste and the other women would put on jail \n11  clothes which were placed on the ground before the women were allowed to put them on. \n12  Because the searches took place outside, in a bus stall, there was often dirt, dust and \n13  sometimes even ants on the clothes they picked up from the ground. The ground was \n14  concrete and dirty, even stained with menstrual blood. Ms. Battiste's feet were often dirty \n15  from standing bare-foot during the searches, but the deputies would sometimes not allow \n16  the women to shower until the following day. \n17  58.  Every time Ms. Battiste was strip searched, she felt embarrassed and \n18  humiliated as a woman. She felt it robbed her of her femininity, of her womanhood. \n19  Every time she was strip searched, at least one woman in the group would cry, especially \n20  the younger women, who felt especially embarrassed about having to expose their bodies. \n21  H.  FELICE CHOLEWIAK \n22  59.  On or about March 26, 2010, Felice Cholewiak was arrested by LAPD and \n23  taken directly to CRDF.  Ms. Cholewiak was strip searched upon arriving at CRDF, and \n24  each time she returned from court.  Each strip search was conducted outdoors in an area \n25  where she has been buses parked.  She estimates that she was strip searched 5 times. \n26  62.  On one side of this bus depot area, there is a blue tarp. The opposite wall is a \n27  brick wall. These walls are approximately 15-20 feet apart. Along another wall, there is a \n28  roll-up door where buses come in and out. Opposite the roll-up door is the entrance to the \n11 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 12 of 29   Page ID\n #:1168\n1  bus depot strip search area. The door to this area is always open. Ms. Cholewiak has \n2  never seen anything obstructing this doorway. She has seen male deputies and male \n3  workers walk by the entrance to the bus depot. These males have an unobstructed view to \n4  the bus depot when women are being strip searched. The floor of the depot is porous, \n5 \ngrey cement, like a sidewalk.  Ms. Cholewiak has seen motor oil on the floor of the bus \n6 \ndepot. She has seen blood on the floor of the bus depot. She has seen bird poop on the \n63.  Before being strip searched in the bus depot area, Ms. Cholewiak was taken \n9 \nto a holding cell. She has waited in that holding cell to be strip searched between 1 to 3 \n10 \nhours. At times it appeared that deputies are waiting for more women to arrive so that \n11   \nthey can strip search more women at one time. At other times it appeared that deputies \n12 \nare waiting for shift change so that the next shift had to strip search the women. \n13 \nDuring a strip search, from 60 to80 women areยท taken off the buses returning from court, \n14 \nand are lined up inside the bus depot against the blue tarp wall and the brick wall.  The \n15 \nwomen are divided into two lines, each line facing the other.  While deputies are lining \n16 \nthe women up, they are constantly ordering them to stand \"shoulder to shoulder\" and to \n17 \n\"get closer.\" They are sometimes standing so close that they touch each other. \n18 \n64.  After the women are lined up, they are ordered to remove all clothing except \n19 \ntheir underwear.  The clothing is then searched and thrown on the ground behind them. \n20 \nShoes are removed along with the clothing and the women stand barefoot during the \n21 \nsearches.  They are ordered to lift their feet.  Ms. Cholewiak and a number of other \n22 \nwomen must steady themselves by touching the wall in front of her. \n23 \n65.  Deputies then shouted \"If you're bleeding and if you have anything between \n24 \nyour legs\" to take out the pad or tampon.  Deputies then gave the women jail issue pads \n25 \nin boxes.  Ms. Cholewiak and the women were ordered to put the used pads or tampons \n26 \nin the boxes and put the new pads on the ground on top of their clothing.  At that point, \n27 \nthey were ordered to tum around and Ms. Cholewiak could see the topless women across \n28 \n12 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 13 of 29   Page ID\n #:1169\n1  from her and next to her.  She could see gang tattoos on some women, and has heard \n2  discussions among some of the women about the tattoos. \n3  66.  The women were then ordered to lift their hair, to lift their breasts and, those \n4  with \"excess fat\" were ordered to lift their stomachs.  They were then ordered to pull \n5  their lips away from their gums, using the same fingers used to remove the menstrual \n6  pads and tampons. Ms. Cholewiak and the women were never able to wash their hands \n7  before putting them in their mouths.  They were then ordered to take down their \n8  underwear, spread their legs, bend over, open their vaginas with their fingers and cough \n9  so deputies could inspect the vaginas with flashlights.  While bending over, Ms. \n10  Cholewiak was able to see the women in the line across from her also bending over. \n11  67.  Ms. Cholewiak and the women were then ordered to pull up their underwear, \n12  put on shirts, pants and shoes, but sock and bras must go in pockets.  The searches \n13  average about 20 minutes, but can take much longer if women do not comply quickly. \n14  Ms. Cholewiak has heard deputies yell, scream and curse at women who do not move \n15  quickly enough, or those who do not speak English.  She has seen deputies taunt women, \n16  and make derogatory remarks within the women's hearing.  Women often cry during the \n17   searches. \n18  68.  Because the searches took place outside, sometimes as late as 10 PM, the \n19  weather was very cold and Ms. Cholewiak could feel the cold wind blowing through the \n20  space.  Every time Ms. Cholewiak was searched, she would be disgusted and tearful.  She \n21  was emotionally exhausted after every search. \n22  I.  EVANGELINA MADRID \n23  69.  Evangelina Madrid's experiences with CRDF began around October 4, 2009 \n24  when she was first arrested by LASD and taken to CRDF.  She estimates that she was \n25  strip searched between 10 to 12 times upon each entry into CRDF, and each time she \n26  returned from court.  Except for those times when Ms. Madrid returned to CRDF from a \n27  medical appointment, she was searched in an outdoor area where she has seen buses \n28  parked. \n13 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 14 of 29   Page ID\n #:1170\n1  70.  One side of the bus depo is a chain link fence which is covered by a blue \n2  tarp.  The opposite wall is brick.  These walls are about 15-20 feet apart.  Along another \n3  wall is a roll-up door where buses come in and out. Opposite the roll-up door is the \n4  entrance to the bus stall from the booking area. Male deputies and workers walking by \n5  the entrance to the bus depo can see the women being searched.  Ms. Madrid states that \n6  there is no privacy and she and the other women are completely exposed. \n7  71.  The floor of the bus stall is porous, grey cement, like a sidewalk. Ms. \n8  Madrid has seen worms and slug-like creatures crawling on the floor, and has seen motor \n9  oil on the floor as well. The ceiling of the stall is a chain link fence covered by a blue tarp \n10  which sometimes flaps up and down in the wind.  Ms. Madrid has been searched outside \n11  in this bus area in the winter when the air feels freezing cold, the cold air blows through \n12  the chain link fencing and the temperature is well below 68 degrees.  Sometimes the \n13  searches were done as late as 10  or 11 P.M. \n14  72.  Ms. Madrid was searched with 20 to 50 other women who were taken from \n15  buses after court.  They are lined up in the bus stall against the chain link and the brick \n16  wall.  After the women are lined up, they are ordered to remove all clothing except their \n17  underwear.  Because the women are forced to stand so close together, Ms. Madrid could \n18  often smell the body odor of women who had not showered.  The clothing is then \n19  searched and thrown on the ground behind them. Shoes are removed along with the \n20  clothing and the women stand barefoot during the searches.  They were then ordered to \n21  lift their hair, to lift their breasts, and to pull their lips away from their gums.  Ms. Madrid \n22  could see the topless bodies of the women in the line facing her.  She could tell who had \n23  breast implants, stretch marks, and those with gang tattoos. \n24  73.  Ms. Madrid and the other women were then ordered to face the wall, take \n25  down their underwear, spread their legs, bend over, open their vaginas with their fingers \n26  and cough.  Sometimes they were ordered to cough for a long as 3 minutes while deputies \n27  inspected their vaginas with flashlights.  While bent over, Ms. Madrid could see the \n28  women in the line facing her also bending over.  These searches could take as long as 15-\n14 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 15 of 29   Page ID\n #:1171\n1  20 minutes if some women were not complying. \n2  74.  Ms. Madrid has been strip searched when she was menstruating.  She was \n3  given a jail issue pad in a cardboard box, ordered to take the new pad and place it on her \n4  clothing on the floor of the stall, remove the old pad and put it in the box, and throw the \n5  box into the middle of the bus stall.  She had to wait about 5 minutes to replace her pad, \n6  and at times had to wait up to 15 minutes.  Ms. Madrid stated that she prayed she \n7  wouldn't bleed while waiting to replace her pad. \n8  7 5.  Ms. Madrid has heard deputies yell and curse at the women in the most \n9  insulting ways.  She has seen deputies grab women who were not complying and throw \n10   them against the wall.  She has often seen women crying during the search process. \n11  Each time she was strip searched, she felt demoralized, humiliated and depressed. \n12  a.  EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES \n13  76.  Ms. Paiz and Ms. Barranca properly filed complaints (i.e. grievances) on \n14  approximately August 6, 2010.  Their complaints requested a sanitary, indoor location for \n15  all strip searches, hidden from the view of anyone not directly involved in the strip each \n16  (including inmates). They also requested equal treatment for men and women. \n17  77.  Ms. Vigil did not personally file a complaint, but, instead, submitted a \n18  complaint letter through her attorneys to Captain Stacy Lee, also on August 6th. This \n19  procedure was expressly authorized by defendant County of Los Angeles because \n20  Michael Gennaco, chief attorney for the County's Office of Independent Review, \n21  informed one of Plaintiffs' counsel that a valid means of filing an internal complaint was \n22  to send a letter authored by counsel on behalf of an inmate setting forth the inmate's \n23  grievance. Ms. Vigil's counsel requested CRDF to advise of any steps that must be taken \n24  in order to comply with complaint exhaustion requirements from the initial complaint \n25  through all appeal/review processes. \n26  78.  Under LASD policy, whenever possible, custody personnel must respond to \n27  inmate complaints within 10 days. As of September 9, 2010, CRDF had not notified any \n28  of the Plaintiffs regarding the disposition of their complaints. Without a response, they \n15 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 16 of 29   Page ID\n #:1172\n1  cannot appeal or otherwise seek review. CRDF has not advised Plaintiffs of what \n2  additional steps, if any, must be taken to comply with the complaint exhaustion process. \n3  79.  On August 20, 2010, Plaintiffs' counsel sent a letter to Captain Stacy Lee to \n4  determine the status of all three complaints. Captain Lee's office has not responded to the \n5  letter or to follow-up phone calls placed by Plaintiffs' attorneys. \n6  80.  Ms. Barranca, Ms. Paiz and Ms. Vigil have satisfied their obligation to \n7  exhaust available remedies. CRDF rendered the complaint process unavailable by \n8  ignoring their complaints. Dole v.  Chandler, 438 F.3d 804, 809, 812 (\" ... a remedy \n9  becomes 'unavailable' if prison employees do not respond to a properly filed grievance \n10  or otherwise use affirmative misconduct to prevent a prisoner from exhausting.\"); Tuttle \n11  v. Boynton, 2009 WL 2134968 (W.D. Mich. 2009) (holding that prisoner whose \n12  grievance was not answered timely and whose requests for an appeal form were denied o \n13  ignored had exhausted available remedies); Underwood v.  Wilson, 151 F.3d 292, 295 (5th \n14  Cir. 1998) (citing with approval pre-PLRA cases excusing exhaustion where irregularities \n15  in the process prevented it or prison officials ignore or interfere with the prisoner's \n16  efforts). \n17  V.  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n18  A.  COMMONFACTUALALLEGATIONS \n19  81.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that women are routinely strip searched \n20  and forced to undergo visual body cavity searches in the manner described above, before \n21  being arraigned. \n22  82.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that women are routinely strip searched \n23  and forced to undergo visual body cavity searches as described above, when they are first \n24  placed in general population. \n25  83.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that men are not routinely strip searched \n26  and forced to undergo visual body cavity searches in the manner described above, before \n27  being arraigned. \n28  84.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that men are not routinely strip searched \n16 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 17 of 29   Page ID\n #:1173\n1  and forced to undergo visual body cavity searches in the manner described above, when \n2  they are first placed in general population.  On information and belief, Plaintiffs allege \n3  the strip and/or visual body cavity searches to which they and class members were \n4  subjected, were performed pursuant to Defendants' policy and practice to \n5  indiscriminately search all, or a large number of women, but not men being processed \n6  into the jail without regard to: a) The nature of their offense or criminal history; b) \n7  Whether they are under an order of release or not; c) Whether they have had contact with \n8  any persons from outside the County jail system who could reasonably be believed to be \n9  a potential source of contraband or weapons; d) Whether there is cause of any kind to \n10   believe they are a potential source of contraband or weapons; e) Whether there is any \n11  other articulable justification for Defendants' indiscriminate strip and body search policy; \n12  f) Whether they are \"pre-arraignment detainees,\" as that term is used in California Penal \n13  Code ยง4030(b ); and g) Whether there is any legitimate reason to strip search women, but \n14  not men, as set forth herein. \n15  85.  On information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have a policy of \n16  not limiting the persons who can see, or hear, or observe all or part of the strip and body \n17  cavity searches to those who are necessary for the procedure. Thus, other inmates, \n18  members of the opposite sex, dispensable jail personnel and possibly others are able to \n19  see or hear some or all of the searches described above. Specifically, class members are \n20  required to submit to strip searches during which other people who are not participating \n21  in the search and/or are of the opposite sex, including jail staff and other inmates, are able \n22  to observe the search and the class members' naked bodies. On further information and \n23  belief, in many instances class members are forced to touch each other's bodies during \n24  the searches in order to comply with the directions given by Sheriffs deputies. \n25  86.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf, and on behalf of a class of all \n26  other persons similarly situated, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil \n27  Procedure. The class is defined as those women who were forced to undergo the unlawful \n28  strip and/or visual body cavity searches in Los Angeles County's jails which are \n17 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 18 of 29   Page ID\n #:1174\n1  operated, maintained and under the control of the County, the LASD and the Supervisory \n2  Defendants as set forth in this complaint;  to wit, searches that violated the Fourth \n3  Amendment or its California equivalent, or searches that violated equal.protection of the \n4  law due to the fact that that the policy and custom of strip searches was applied to \n5  women, but not to men. \n6  87.  Due to the previous filing of Solis v. Baca, No. CV06-1135 SVW (CTx), a \n7  case currently pending in this court, the class period goes back two years prior to the \n8  filing of that case, which also alleges violation of the Fourth Amendment and equal \n9  protection rights of those subjected to strip searches by the Los Angeles County Sheriffs \n10  Department. Because the pendency of that case has tolled the statute of limitations for the \n11  class members herein, the statute oflimitations in this case reaches back to May 30, 2004. \n12  88.  Plaintiffs have also engaged in pre-litigation settlement efforts.  Specifically, \n13  Plaintiffs showed Defendants a draft copy of this complaint, and asked that Defendants \n14  immediately cease and desist their unlawful practices.  Plaintiffs also raised this issue \n15  with Defendants' counsel during a meeting to discuss county strip search policies.  To \n16  date, and to Plaintiffs' knowledge, Defendants continue to engage in the unlawful \n17  practices detailed in this complaint. \n18  89.  On information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants will continue \n19  their aforementioned policy and practice of unlawful strip and/or visual body cavity \n20  searches unless enjoined and restrained by the court.  Without injunctive relief applicable \n21  to the class as a whole, the class members will suffer irreparable harm for which there is \n22  no adequate remedy at law in that their constitutional and statutory rights will be \n23  systematically violated. \n24  b.  RULE 23 PREREQUISITES \n25  i.  Numerosity \n26  90.  In accordance with F.R.Civ. P. Rule 23(a), the members of the class are so \n27  numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Plaintiffs do not know the exact \n28  number of class members. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that \n18 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 19 of 29   Page ID\n #:1175\n1  there are more than 300 inmates per day who are subjected to strip and/or body cavity \n2  searches as a result of Defendants' policy and practice of indiscriminately subjecting \n3  prisoners to strip and body cavity searches. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and \n4  thereon allege, that the number of persons in the proposed class is in the thousands. \n5  ii.  Common Issues of Fact or Law \n6  91.  In accordance with P.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), there are questions of fact \n7  common to the class. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that the \n8  common questions of fact include, but are not limited to the following: (1) Whether the \n9  LASD routinely subjects all prisoners to strip and/or body cavity searches without any \n10  reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe any particular \n11  inmate has concealed drug(s), weapon(s) and/or any contraband on their persons or in \n12  their body cavities; (2) Whether the strip and/or body cavity searches are conducted in an \n13  area of privacy so that the search cannot be observed by persons not participating in the \n14  search, or whether the strip and body cavity searches are conducted in areas where they \n15  may be observed by persons not participating in the searches; (3) Whether the strip and/o \n16  body cavity searches are conducted in an unsanitary area, infested with bacteria such as \n17  MRSA and other communicable diseases; (4) Whether females are subjected to strip \n18  and/or body cavity searches when males are not; (5) Whether females are subjected to \n19  strip and/or body cavity searches under conditions which are more intrusive and less \n20  sanitary than males. \n21  92.  In accordance with P.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), there are questions oflaw \n22  common to the class. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and, thereon allege, that the \n23  common questions oflaw include but are not limited to the following: (1) Whether the \n24  LASD may indiscriminately conduct strip and/or body cavity searches of inmates without \n25  there being any reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe any \n26  particular inmate has concealed drug(s), weapon(s) and/or any contraband on their \n27  persons or in their body cavities; (2) Whether the LASD may conduct strip and/or body \n28  cavity searches of inmates in open areas where they may be observed by persons not \n19 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 20 of 29   Page ID\n #:1176\n1  participating in the searches; (3) Whether LASD's policy of subjecting persons to strip \n2  and/or body cavity searches violates California Penal Code ยง4030; (4) Whether LASD's \n3  policy of subjecting persons to strip and/or body cavity searches in an area which is not \n4  an \"area of privacy\" violates California Penal Code ยง4030(m); (5) Whether the conduct \n5  described above violates the Fourth and/or Fourteenth Amendments, and/or California \n6  Constitution Article I,ยงยง 1, 7, and/or 13; (6) Whether the conduct described above \n7  constitutes a policy or custom of Defendants; (7) Whether any individual Defendant is \n8  entitled to qualified immunity on the federal claims, or state law immunity on the state \n9  law claims, for the practices complained of herein; and (8) Whether determination of \n10  damages suffered by a statistically representative sample of the class provides the basis \n11  for determination of all class members' damages except those who opt out, or whether \n12  category damages may appropriately be determined for the class members. \n13  iii.  Typicality \n14  93.  In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), the claims of the representative \n15  Plaintiffs are typical of the class. Plaintiffs were in LASD custody when they were \n16  subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity searches of inmates without any reasonable \n17  suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe that any Plaintiff and class \n18  members had concealed drug(s), weapon(s) and/or any contraband in their body cavities; \n19  Plaintiffs were subjected to the searches in open areas where they were observed by other \n20  inmates and persons not involved in the search, including sometimes members of the \n21  opposite sex; Plaintiffs were searched and forced to stand naked in unsanitary and \n22  bacteria infested areas; females were subjected to strip and/or body cavity searches when \n23  males were not; and females were subjected to strip and/or body cavity searches under \n24  conditions which were more intrusive and less sanitary than males. \n25  94.  Thus, Plaintiffs have the same interests and have suffered the same type of \n26  damages as the class members. Plaintiffs' claims are based upon the same or similar legal \n27  theories as the claims of the class m~mbers. Each class member suffered actual damages \n28  as a result of being subjected to a strip and/or body cavity search. The actual damages \n20 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 21 of 29   Page ID\n #:1177\n1  suffered by Plaintiffs are similar in type and amount to the actual damages suffered by \n2  each class member. \n3  95.  In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), the representative Plaintiffs will \n4  fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. The interests of the representative \n5  Plaintiffs are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class. \n6  iv.  Maintenance and Superiority \n7  96.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b )(1 )(A), prosecutions of separate \n8  actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that inconsistent or \n9  varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would establish \n10  incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the class. \n11  97.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions of separate \n12  actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of adjudications with \n13  respect to individual members of the class which would, as a practical matter, \n14  substantially impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class to protect \n15  their interests. \n16  98.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ~P. Rule 23(b)(2), Plaintiffs are informed and \n17  believe, and thereon allege that Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to \n18  the class. \n19  99.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(3), the questions oflaw or fact \n20  common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only \n21  individual members, and this class action is superior to other available methods for the \n22  fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy between the parties. Plaintiffs are \n23  informed and believe, and thereon allege, that the interests of class members in \n24  individually controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low in that most class \n25  members would be unable to individually prosecute any action at all. Plaintiffs are \n26  informed and believe, and thereon allege that the amounts at stake for individuals are \n27  such that separate suits would be impracticable in that most members of the class will not \n28  be able to find counsel to represent them. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon \n21 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 22 of 29   Page ID\n #:1178\n1  allege, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the \n2  claims arise in the same location, i.e., the County of Los Angeles. It will promote judicial \n3  efficiency to resolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum rather than in \n4  multiple courts. \n5  100.  Plaintiffs do not know the identities of the class members. Plaintiffs are \n6  informed and believe, and thereon allege, that the identities of the class members are \n7  ascertainable from LASD records, in particular the LASD AJIS computer system used to \n8  track and identify LASD inmates. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, \n9  that AJIS reflects the identities, including addresses and telephone numbers, of the \n10  persons who have been held in custody by LASD; when inmates were arrested and \n11  booked, taken to court, returned from court; why inmates were released; and when \n12  inmates were released. \n13  101.  Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that will be encountered in the management \n14  of this litigation that would preclude its maintenance as a class action. The class action is \n15  superior to any other available means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the class. \n16  The class action will be manageable because so many different records systems exist \n17  from which to ascertain the members of the class. Liability can be determined on a class-\n18  wide basis. Damages can be determined on a class-wide basis using a damages matrix set \n19  by a jury, or by trying the damages of a statistically valid sample of the class to a jury and \n20  extrapolating those damages to the class as a whole. \n21  102.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(3), class members must be \n22  furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual \n23  notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort. Plaintiffs are \n24  informed and believe that LASD computer records contain a last known address for class \n25  members. Plaintiffs contemplate that individual notice be given to class members at such \n26  last known address by first class mail. Plaintiffs contemplate that the notice inform class \n27  members of the following: \n28  A.  The pendency of the class action, and the issues common to the class; \n22 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 23 of 29   Page ID\n #:1179\n1  B.  The nature of the action; \n2  c.  Their right to 'opt out' of the action within a given time, in which \n3  event they will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class \n4  action; \n5  D.  Their right, if they do not 'opt out,' to be represented by their own \n6 \ncounsel and enter an appearance in the case; otherwise, they will be \n7 \nrepresented by the named Plaintiffs and their counsel; and \n8 \nE.  Their right, if they do not 'opt out,' to share in any recovery in favor \n9 \nof the class, and conversely to be bound by any judgment on the \n10 \ncommon issues, adverse to the class. \n11 \n103.  Plaintiffs restate and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing and \n12 \nensuing paragraphs in each of the following causes of action as if each paragraph was \n13 \nfully set forth therein. \n14 \nCOUNT ONE- 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 [FOURTH AMENDMENT] \n15  (All Defendants) \n16 \n104.  In subjecting Plaintiffs and class members to the unnecessary, demeaning, \n17 \nand outrageous intrusive strip and body cavity search, Defendants, and each of them, \n18 \nviolated Plaintiffs' and class members' rights to be secure in their persons against \n19 \nunreasonable searches and seizures as guaranteed by the Fourth and Fourteenth \n20 \nAmendments to the United States Constitution. Therefore, Plaintiffs and class members \n21 \nare entitled to bring suit and recover damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n22 \n1 05.  The aforementioned acts of Defendants proximately caused Plaintiffs to be \n23 \ndeprived of their rights as stated above, thereby entitling Plaintiffs and the class to \n24 \ndamages in an amount to be proven at trial. \n25 \n106.  Plaintiffs Lora Barranca, Diana Paiz and Diane Vigil remain incarcerated at \n26 \nCRDF, and will remain incarcerated beyond their upcoming court appearances. Because \n27 \nCRDF will require them to submit to strip searches/body cavity searches upon returning \n28 \n23 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 24 of 29   Page ID\n #:1180\n1  from court, they will continue to suffer deprivations of their rights and, therefore, seek \n2  injunctive relief on behalf of themselves and the class of similarly situated individuals. \n3 \nCOUNT TWO- 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 [EQUAL PROTECTION] \n4 \n(All Defendants) \n5 \n6  10 7.  The unequal treatment of men and women - and the unnecessary, \n7  demeaning, and outrageous intrusive strip and body cavity searches inflicted on women \n8  but not men - deprived the female class members of the protections afforded by \n9  provisions of the 14th Amendment Equal Protection guarantees. Therefore, the female \no \n1  Plaintiffs and class members are entitled to bring suit and recover damages pursuant to 42 \n11  U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n12  108.  The aforementioned acts of Defendants proximately caused Plaintiffs to be \n13  deprived of their rights as stated above, thereby entitling Plaintiffs and the class to \n14  damages in an amount to be proven at trial. \n15  10 9.  Plaintiffs Lora Barranca, Diana Paiz and Diane Vigil remain incarcerated at \n16  CRDF and will remain incarcerated beyond their upcoming court appearances. Because \n17  CRDF will require them to submit to strip searches/body cavity searches upon  returning \n18  from court, they will continue to suffer deprivations of their rights and therefore seek \n19  injunctive relief on behalf of themselves and the class of similarly situated individuals. \nCOUNT THREE- ARTICLE 1, ยงยง1 AND 13 OF THE CALIFORNIA \n20 \nCONSTITUTION [PRIVACY/FOURTH AMENDMENT ANALOGUE] \n21 \n(All Defendants) \n22 \n110.  Plaintiffs filed a Govt. Code ยง910 claim for damages against Defendants for \n23 \nthe matters set forth in this complaint, thereby making it unnecessary for the newly added \n24 \nnamed Plaintiffs to file individual ยง910 claims. \n25 \n111.  The unnecessary, demeaning, outrageous, and intrusive strip and body cavit \n26 \nsearch to which Plaintiffs and class members were subjected violated Plaintiffs' rights no \n27 \nto be subjected to invasion of their fundamental privacy interests, as guaranteed by \n28 \n24 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 25 of 29   Page ID\n #:1181\n1  Article I, ยง 1 of the California Constitution; and to be secure in their persons against \n2  unreasonable searches and seizures, as guaranteed by Article I, ยง 13 of the California \n3  Constitution. \n4  112.  The aforementioned acts of Defendants proximately caused Plaintiffs to be \n5  deprived of their rights as stated above, thereby entitling Plaintiffs and the class to \n6  damages in an amount to be proven at trial. \n7  113.  Plaintiffs Lora Barranca, Diana Paiz and Diane Vigil remain incarcerated at \n8  CRDF, and will remain incarcerated beyond their upcoming court appearances. Because \n9  CRDF will require them to submit to strip searches/body cavity searches upon returning \n10  from court, they will continue to suffer deprivations of their rights and, therefore, seek \n11  injunctive relief on behalf of themselves and the class of similarly situated individuals. \n12 \nCOUNT FOUR- ARTICLE 1, ยง7, OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION \n13 \n[EQUAL PROTECTION] \n14  (All Defendants) \n15 \n114.  The unequal treatment of men and women violated the female Plaintiffs' \n16 \nrights not to be denied equal protection of the law, as guaranteed by Article I, ยง7 of the \n17 \nCalifornia Constitution, and to be secure in their persons against unreasonable searches \n18 \nand seizures as guaranteed by Article I,ยง 13 of the California Constitution. \n19 \n115.  The aforementioned acts of Defendants proximately caused Plaintiffs to be \n20 \ndeprived of their rights as stated above, thereby entitling Plaintiffs and the class to \n21 \ndamages in an amount to be proven at trial. \n22 \n116.  Plaintiffs Lora Barranca, Diana Paiz and Diane Vigil remain incarcerated at \n23 \nCRDF, and will remain incarcerated beyond their upcoming court appearances. Because \n24 \nCRDF will require them to submit to strip searches/body cavity searches upon  returning \n28 \n25 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 26 of 29   Page ID\n #:1182\n1  117.  The unnecessary, demeaning, and outrageous intrusive strip and/or visual \n2  body cavity searches alleged herein were accomplished via threat, intimidation or \n3  coercion and/or threats of the same. \n4  118.  The unnecessary, demeaning, and outrageous intrusive strip and visual body \n5  cavity searches, and the unequal treatment of women as opposed to men, deprived \n6  Plaintiffs and the class they represent of the protections afforded by provisions of federal \n7  constitutional and state constitutional and statutory law including, but not limited to \n8  rights protected under the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \n9  States Constitution; Article I,ยงยง 1, 7, 13, and 17, of the California state constitution, and \n10  California Penal Code ยง4030. Therefore, Plaintiffs and the class are entitled to bring suit \n11  and recover damages pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code ยง52.1 (b). \n12  119.  As a direct and proximate cause of the aforementioned acts, Plaintiffs and \n13  class members were damaged in an amount to be proven at trial but in any event not less \n14  than $4,000 per violation pursuant to the provisions of Civil Code ยง52(b). \n15  120.  The aforementioned acts of Defendants directly and proximately caused \n16  Plaintiffs to be deprived of their California constitutional rights as stated above, thereby \n17  entitling Plaintiffs and class members to recover damages proximately caused by \n18  Defendants' wrongful acts. \n19  121.  Plaintiffs Lora Barranca, Diana Paiz and Diane Vigil remain incarcerated at \n20  CRDF, and will remain incarcerated beyond their upcoming court appearances. Because \n21  CRDF will require them to submit to strip searches/body cavity searches upon  returning \n22  from court, they will continue to suffer deprivations of their rights and therefore seek \n23  injunctive relief on behalf of themselves and the class of similarly situated individuals. \n24  COUNT SIX- Violation of Statutory Duties \n(Penal Code ยง4030) \n25 \n(Against Defendants County and LASD Only) \n26 \n27  122.  The unnecessary, demeaning, outrageous, and intrusive strip and body cavi \n28  searches, to which Plaintiffs and the class members were subjected by Defendants, \n26 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 27 of 29   Page ID\n #:1183\n1  violated Plaintiffs' and the class members' state-law protections guaranteed by California \n2  Penal Code ยง4030.  The aforementioned acts of Defendants directly and proximately \n3 \ncaused the Plaintiffs and the class members to be deprived of their rights as stated above, \n4 \nthereby entitling Plaintiffs and class members to recover damages proximately caused by \n5 \nDefendants' wrongful acts, including statutory damages under Penal Code ยง4030. \n6 \n123.  Plaintiffs Lora Barranca, Diana Paiz and Diane Vigil remain incarcerated at \n7 \nCRDF, and will remain incarcerated beyond their upcoming court appearances. Because \n8 \nCRDF will require them to submit to strip searches/body cavity searches upon  returning \n9 \nfrom court, they will continue to suffer deprivations of their rights and, therefore, seek \n10 \ninjunctive relief on behalf of themselves and the class of similarly situated individuals. \n11 \n12 \nCOUNT SEVEN- Violation of Mandatory Duties \n13  (Against Defendants County and LASD) \n14 \n124.  The Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \n15 \nConstitution; Article I, ยงยง1, 7, 13, and 17, ofthe California state constitution; California \n16 \nPenal Code ยง4030; and California Civil Code ยง52.1 are enactments. Enactments form the \n17 \nbasis of a mandatory duty under California Government Code ยง815 .6. \n18 \n125.  Any California constitutional provision is mandatory and prohibitory, per \n19 \nArticle 1, ยง26, of the California Constitution. \n20 \n126.  These constitutional provisions and statutes apply to all members of the \n21 \ngeneral public, including Plaintiffs, and were all designed to prevent the kind of injuries \n22 \nalleged herein. \n23 \n127.  Defendants did not exercise reasonable diligence in discharging their duty \n128.  As a direct and proximate cause of the aforementioned acts of Defendants, \n26 \nPlaintiffs and class members were damaged in amounts to be determined at trial. \n27 \nIll \n28 \n27 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 28 of 29   Page ID\n #:1184\n1  APPROPRIATENESS OF EQUITABLE RELIEF \n2  129.  Plaintiffs Barranca, Paiz and Vigil remain incarcerated at CRDF and will be \n3  required to attend at least one court appearance before they are released from custody. \n4  Upon returning from court, these Plaintiffs will be strip searched/body cavity searched \n5  under the conditions described above. \n6  130.  CRDF's continuing practice of strip searching/body cavity searching female \n7  inmates en masse, in an unsanitary, non-private, outdoor area violates Plaintiffs' \n8  constitutional rights, and causes continuing, sweeping and irreparable harm to Plaintiffs \n9  Barranca, Paiz and Vigil. \n10   131.  Because no adequate remedy at law exists for the injuries alleged herein, \n11  Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief under both federal and state law. \n12 \nVII.  PRAYER \n13 \n14  WHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs,  on behalf of themselves  and the  class members  the \n15  represent, request damages against each defendant as follows: \n16  1.  General and special damages according to proof; \n17  2.  Temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting \n18 \nDefendants from continuing to engage in the unlawful practices complained of herein; \n19 \n3.  As  against the individual Defendants only, punitive damages according t \n20 \nproof; \n21 \n4.  In addition to actual damages, statutory damages as allowed by law, \n22 \nincluding Penal Code ยง4030 and treble damages under California Civil Code ยงยง52 and \n23 \n24  52.1; \n25  5.  Attorneys' fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. ยง1988; California Civil Code \n26  ยงยง52(b)(3), 52.l(h); California Code of Civil Procedure ยง1021.5, and whatever other \n27  statute or law may be applicable; \n28 \n28 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 109   Filed 01/28/11   Page 29 of 29   Page ID\n #:1185\n1  6.

(lom) (Entered: 07/18/2014)\n07/17/2014 256  IN CHAMBERS ORDER REQUIRING SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEFING ON CLASS\nCERTIFICATION MOTION by Judge Stephen V. Wilson: The Court ORDERS as\nfollows: Plaintiffs alternative proposals to expand the classwide issues to include\ninmates experiences of verbal abuse or to define a subclass of inmates who were\nesposed to verbal abuse are DENIED for the reasons expressed in the Courts order of\nMarch 12, 2014. (See Dkt 232: Order at 11โ13.) Membership in such a subclass (or in\nan expanded class encompassing these allegations) would not be reasonably\nascertainable in view of the difficulty of defining what constitutes abusive language\nand the significant variation in deputies behavior. See Keegan v. American Honda\nMotor Co., 284 F.R.D. 504, 521 (C.D. Cal. 2012). However, the Court DEFERS ruling\non whether subclasses should be certified for inmates who experienced unsanitary\nconditions, extreme weather conditions, or inadequate privacy protection. The parties\nshall file supplemental briefs. (SEE ORDER FOR DETAILS.) Plaintiffs shall file a\nsupplemental brief of no more than 25 pages addressing the foregoing questions not\nlater than August 4, 2014. Defendants shall file a responsive brief of no more than 25\npages not more than 14 days after plaintiffs brief. Plaintiffs may file a reply of no more\nthan 15 pages within 7 days of the filing of defendants brief. The parties shall appear\nfor a further hearing on this matter on Monday, September 8, 2014, at 1:30 p.m. The\nCourt concludes that further briefing on the question of whether certification of a\ndamages class on the issue of liability pursuant to Rules 23(b)(3) and 23(c)(4) would\nbe superior to individual lawsuits should await answers to the foregoing questions. The\nCourt DEFERS ruling on defendants evidentiary objections to plaintiffs renewed\nmotion 249 .

The gravamen of this complaint concerns the privacy rights of inmates, who \n7  are routinely subjected to strip and body cavity searches in violation of the Constitutions \n8  and laws ofthe United States and the State of California. \n9  3.  Of particular concern is that female inmates are subjected to degrading strip \n10  and body cavity searches under circumstances and conditions when male inmates are not. \n11  II.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12  4.  Plaintiffs present federal claims for relief under 42 U.S.C. ยง1983. \n13  Accordingly, federal jurisdiction in conferred upon this Court by 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and \n14  1343.

Plaintiffs are ignorant of the true names and capacities of defendants sued \n21  herein as DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, and therefore sue these defendants by such \n22  fictitious names. Plaintiffs will give notice of this complaint, and of one of more DOES' \n23  true names and capacities, when ascertained. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and \n24  based thereon allege, that defendants DOES 1 through 5 are responsible in some manner \n25  for the damages and injuries hereinafter complained of. \n26  13.  DOES 6 through 10 (hereinafter collectively referred to as \"LASD \n27  Supervisory defendants\") were and are now responsible for the LASD jails and, among \n28  other things, are responsible for the training, supervision, control, assignment and \n2 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 4 of 16   Page ID #:4\n1  discipline of the sworn and civilian personnel of the LASD and County who work in, \n2  operate, administer and manage the jails, and for the formulation, promulgation, \n3  adoption, application, administration and enforcement of the policies, rules, regulations \n4  and practices ofthe LASD jails. \n5  14.  Upon information and belief, plaintiffs further allege that, at all times \n6  relevant herein, the LASD Supervisory defendants participated in, approved, and/or \n7  ratified the unconstitutional or illegal acts complained of herein that occurred within \n8  LASD jails. \n9  15.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege that, at all times \n10  relevant herein, the individual defendants, and each of them, were the agents, servants \n11  and employees of their respective employers (defendants LASD, County) and were actin \n12  at all times within the scope of their agency and employment, and with the knowledge \n13  and consent of their principals and employers. At all times herein, defendants, and each \n14  of them, were acting un~er the color of state law. \n15  IV.  CLAIMS OF CLASS REPRESENTATIVES \n16  A.  MARY AMADOR \n17  16.  Mary Amador was arrested by Los Angeles County Sheriff's personnel on o \n18  about March 1, 2009. She surrendered to a Detective Corrigan in the parking lot of the \n19  Century Regional Detention Facility (\"CRDF\"), after Detective Corrigan told her she had \n20  a welfare-fraud warrant for her arrest. CRDF is commonly known and referred to as the \n21  \"Lynwood Jail\".  The detective gave Mrs. Amador a week to surrender so Mrs. Amador \n22  could make arrangements for child care for her young daughter, and so she could arrange \n23  bail. Mrs. Amador surrendered at 9:00 a.m. Bail had already been posted. \n24  17.  Mrs. Amador was strip searched about 6-7 p.m. that evening, in a group with \n25  about 12 other women, outside in the cold open air, in an area bordered on one side by a \n26  facility wall and entry door, on another by a solid block wall, on the third by a solid gate, \n27  and on the fourth by a chain link fence shielded by a tom and shredded tarp through \n28  which she could see about five male deputies on the other side. The location was \n3 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 5 of 16   Page ID #:5\n1  apparently a driveway and/or discharge area for buses. \n2  18.  The ground was concrete. The women were required to completely disrobe, \n3  place their street clothes on the ground, squat, spread their buttocks, lift their breasts, etc., \n4  and change into jail attire, which they picked up from the ground. \n5  19.  One of the women, about 60 years old, complained bitterly of the cold, and \n6  cried. \n7  20.  Having spent most of the day with four of the women, Mrs. Amador had \n8  learned that they had just been arrested and had not yet been to court. Of course, Mrs. \n9  Amador had not been to cowt, either. \n10  21.  About an hour after having been strip searched, Mrs. Amador was released \n11  on bail. A jailer told Mrs. Amador the bond had been at the jail since 9:00 am in the \n12  mommg. \n13  22.  The day after bailing out, Mrs. Amador called the facility to complain about \n14  the strip search. She left a detailed voice mail on the watch commander's extension. She \n15  never heard back. \n16  23.  Mrs. Amador and the women were searched as a group, with each woman \n17  able to, and forced to watch the other women being searched. They were forced to stand \n18  naked within inches of each other as they were searched. They were forced to place their \n19  clothing on the unsanitary ground. This is the same ground plaintiff and the women were \n20  forced to stand on, barefoot and naked. \n21  B.  LORNA MALLYON \n22  24.  Lorna Mallyon, at the time 30 years old, was arrested on September 23, \n23  2008, by Glendale police on a misdemeanor charge of violating Cal. Penal Code \n24  ยง496D(a) (knowingly purchasing stolen vehicle). Ms. Mallyon was held in Glendale jail \n25  until September 25, 2008, at which time she was arraigned on the above charge in Los \n26  Angeles Superior Court (Glendale). Afterward, she was remanded to the custody of the \n27  Los Angeles County Sheriff and transported to CRDF. Upon arrival at CRDF, she was \n28  strip and visual body cavity searched in a group, without privacy and outside. \n4 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 6 of 16   Page ID #:6\n1  25.  On September 30, 2008, Ms. Mallyon was released from jail on her own \n2  recognizance. Ultimately, the underlying criminal case on which Ms. Mallyon was held \n3  was dismissed. \nv. \n4  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n5  A.  COMMONFACTUALALLEGATIONS \n6  26.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that women are routinely strip searched \n7  and forced to undergo visual body cavity searches in the manner described above, before \n8  being arraigned. \n9  27.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that women are routinely strip searched \n10  and forced to undergo visual body cavity searches as described above, when they are first \n11  placed in general population. \n12  28.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that men are not routinely strip searched \n13  and forced to undergo visual body cavity searches in the manner described above, before \n14  being arraigned. \n15  29.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe that men are not routinely strip searched \n16  and forced to undergo visual body cavity searches in the manner described above, when \n17  they are first placed in general population. \n18  30.  On information and belief, plaintiffs allege the strip and/or visual body \n19  cavity searches to which they and class members were subjected, were done pursuant to \n20  defendants' policy and practice to indiscriminately search all or a large number of women \n21  but not men being processed into the jail without regard to: a) The nature of their offense \n22  or criminal history; b) Whether they are under an order Of release or not; c) Whether they \n2~  have had contact with any persons from outside the County jail system who could \n24  reasonably be believed to be a potential source of contraband or weapons; d) Whether \n25  there is cause of any kind to believe they are a potential source of contraband or weapons; \n26  e) Whether there is any other articulable justification for defendants' indiscriminate strip \n27  and body search policy; f) Whether they are \"pre-arraignment detainees,\" as that term is \n28  used in California Penal Code ยง4030(b); and g) Whether there is any legitimate reason to \n5 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 7 of 16   Page ID #:7\n1  strip search women but not men as set forth herein. \n2  31.  On information and belief, plaintiffs allege that defendants have a policy of \n3  not limiting the persons who can see or hear or observe all or part ofthe strip and body \n4  cavity searches to those who are necessary to the procedure. Thus, other inmates, \n5  members of the opposite sex, dispensable jail personnel and possibly others are able to \n6  see or hear some or all of the searches described above. Specifically, class members are \n7  required to submit to strip searches during which other people who are not participating \n8  in the search and/or are of the opposite sex, including jail staff and other inmates, are able \n9  to observe the search and the class members' naked bodies. On further information and \n10  belief, in many instances class members are forced to touch each other's bodies during \n11  the searches in order to comply with the directions given by Sheriffs deputies. \n12  32.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf, and on behalf of a class of all \n13  other persons similarly situated, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil \n14  Procedure. The class is defined as those women who were forced to undergo the unlawful \n15  strip and/or visual body cavity searches in Los Angeles County's jails (which are \n16  operated, maintained and under the control of the County, the LASD and the Supervisory \n17  defendants) set forth in this complaint;  to wit, searches that violated the Fourth \n18  Amendment or its California equivalent, or searches that violated equal protection of the \n19  law due to the fact that that the policy and custom of strip searches was applied to women \n20  but not men. \n21  33.  Due to the previous filing of Solis v. Baca, No. CV06-1135 SVW (CTx) \n22  (C.D. Calif.), a case currently pending in this court, the class period goes back two years \n23  prior to the filing of that case, which also alleges violation of the Fourth Amendment and \n24  equal protection rights ofthose subjected to strip searches by the Los Angeles County \n25  Sheriffs Department. Because the pendency of that case has tolled the statute of \n26  limitations for the class members herein, the statute oflimitations in this case reaches \n27  back to May 30, 2004. Plaintiffs anticipate that a motion to amend the existing Solis v. \n28  Baca complaint will be filed in the near future to allege that women but not men were \n6 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 8 of 16   Page ID #:8\n1  subjected to the strip search policy alleged herein. Plaintiffs file this complaint for \n2  precautionary reasons because defendants may contend that the Solis complaint may not \n3  be amended in the respects described herein. \n4  34.  Plaintiffs also engaged in pre-litigation settlement efforts.  Specifically, \n5  plaintiffs showed defendants a draft copy of this complaint and asked that defendants \n6  immediately cease and desist their unlawful practices.  Plaintiffs also raised this issue \n7  with defendants' counsel during a meeting to discuss county strip search policies.  To \n8  date, and to plaintiffs' lmowledge, defendants continue to engage in the unlawful \n9  practices detailed in this complaint. \n10  35.  On information and belief, plaintiffs allege that defendants will continue \n11  their aforementioned policy and practice of unlawful strip and/or visual body cavity \n12  searches unless enjoined and restrained by the court.  Without injunctive relief applicable \n13  to the class as a whole, the class members will suffer irreparable harm for which there is \n14  no adequate remedy at law in that their constitutional and statutory rights will be \n15  systematically violated. \n16  B.  RULE 23 PREREQUISITES \n17  1.  Numerosity \n18  36.  In accordance with F.R.Civ. P. Rule 23(a), the members of the class are so \n19  numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Plaintiffs do not know the exact \n20  number of class members. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that \n21  there are more than 300 inmates per day who are subjected to strip and/or body cavity \n22  searches as a result of defendants' policy and practice of indiscriminately subjecting \n23  prisoners to strip and body cavity searches. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and \n24  thereon allege that the number of persons in the proposed class is in the thousands. \n25  2.  Common Issues of Fact or Law \n26  37.  In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), there are questions offact \n27  common to the class. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that the \n28  common questions offact include, but are not limited to the following: (1) Whether the \n7 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 9 of 16   Page ID #:9\n1  LASD routinely subjects all prisoners to strip and/or body cavity searches without there \n2  being any reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe any \n3  particular inmate has concealed drug(s), weapon(s) and/or any contraband on their \n4  persons or in their body cavities; (2) Whether the strip and/or body cavity searches are \n5  conducted in an area of privacy so that the search cannot be observed by persons not \n6  participating in the search, or whether the strip and body cavity searches are conducted in \n7  areas where they may be observed by persons not participating in the searches; (3) \n8  Whether the strip and/or body cavity searches are conducted in an unsanitary area, \n9  infested with bacteria such as MRSA and other communicable diseases; (4) whether \n10  females are subjected to strip and/or body cavity searches when males are not; (5) \n11  whether females are subjected to strip and/or body cavity searches under conditions \n12  which are more intrusive and less sanitary than males. \n13  38.  In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), there are questions oflaw \n14  common to the class. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that the \n15  common questions oflaw include but are not limited to the following: (1) Whether the \n16  LASD may indiscriminately conduct strip and/or body cavity searches of inmates without \n17  there being any reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe any \n18  particular inmate has concealed drug(s), weapon(s) and/or any contraband on their \n19  persons or in their body cavities; (2) Whether the LASD may conduct strip and/or body \n20  cavity searches of inmates in open areas where they may be observed by persons not \n21  participating in the searches; (3) Whether LASD' s policy of subjecting persons to strip \n22  and/or body cavity searches violates California Penal Code ยง4030; (4) Whether LASD's \n23  policy of subjecting persons to strip and/or body cavity searches in an area which is not \n24  an \"area of privacy\" violates California Penal Code ยง4030(m); (5) Whether the conduct \n25  described above violates the Fourth and/or Fourteenth Amendments, and/or California \n26  Constitution Article I, ยงยง 1, 7, and/or 13; (6) Whether the conduct described above \n27  constitutes a policy or custom of the defendants; (7) Whether any individual defendant is \n28  entitled to qualified immunity on the federal claims, or state law immunity on the state \n8 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 10 of 16   Page ID #:10\n1  law claims, for the practices complained of herein; and (8) Whether determination of \n2  damages suffered by a statistically representative sample of the class provides the basis \n3  for determination of all class members' damages except those who opt out, or whether \n4  category damages may appropriately be determined for the class members. \n5  3.  Typicality \n6  39.  In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), the claims ofthe representative \n7  plaintiffs are typical of the class. Plaintiffs were in LASD custody when they were \n8  subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity searches of inmates without there being any \n9  reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe that any plaintiff \n10  and class members had concealed drug(s), weapon(s) and/or any contraband in their body \n11  cavities; plaintiffs were subjected to the searches in open areas where they were observed \n12  by other inmates and persons not involved in the search, including sometimes members \n13  ofthe opposite sex; plaintiffs were searched and forced to stand naked in unsanitary and \n14  bacteria infested areas; females were subjected to strip and/or body cavity searches when \n15  males were not; and females were subjected to strip and/or body cavity searches under \n16  conditions which were more intrusive and less sanitary than males. \n17  40.  Thus, plaintiffs have the same interests and have suffered the same type of \n18  damages as the class members. Plaintiffs' claims are based upon the same or similar legal \n19  theories as the claims of the class members. Each class member suffered actual damages \n20  as a result of being subjected to a strip and/or body cavity search. The actual damages \n21  suffered by plaintiffs are similar in type and amount to the actual damages suffered by \n22  each class member. \n23  41.  In accordance with F.R. Civ. P. Rule 23(a), the representative plaintiffs will \n24  fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. The interests of the representative \n25  plaintiffs are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class. \n26  4.  Maintenance and Superiority \n27  42.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b )(1 )(A), prosecutions of separate \n28  actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that inconsistent or \n9 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 11 of 16   Page ID #:11\n1  varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would establish \n2  incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the class. \n3  43.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b )(1 )(B), prosecutions of separate \n4  actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of adjudications with \n5  respect to individual members of the class which would, as a practical matter, \n6  substantially impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class to protect \n7  their interests. \n8  44.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b )(2), plaintiffs are informed and \n9  believe, and thereon allege that the defendants have acted on grounds generally \n10  applicable to the class. \n11  45.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(3), the questions oflaw or fact \n12  common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only \n13  individual members, and this class action is superior to other available methods for the \n14  fair and efficient adjudication ofthe controversy between the parties. Plaintiffs are \n15  informed and believe, and thereon allege that the interest of class members in \n16  individually controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low in that most class \n17  members would be unable to individually prosecute any action at all. Plaintiffs are \n18  informed and believe, and thereon allege that the amounts at stake for individuals are \n19  such that separate suits would be impracticable in that most members of the class will not \n20  be able to find counsel to represent them. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon \n21  allege that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the \n22  claims arise in the same location, i.e., the County of Los Angeles. It will promote judicial \n23  efficiency to resolve the common questions oflaw and fact in one forum, rather than in \n24  multiple courts. \n25  46.  Plaintiffs do not know the identities of the class members. Plaintiffs are \n26  informed and believe, and thereon allege that the identities of the class members are \n27  ascertainable from LASD records, in particular the LASD AJIS computer system used to \n28  track and identify LASD inmates. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege \n10 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 12 of 16   Page ID #:12\n1  that AJIS reflects the identities, including addresses and telephone numbers, of the \n2  persons who have been held in custody by LASD; when inmates were arrested and \n3  booked, taken to court, returned from court; why inmates were released; and when \n4  inmates were released. \n5  47.  Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that will be encountered in the management \n6  of this litigation that would preclude its maintenance as a class action. The class action is \n7  superior to any other available means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the class. \n8  The class action will be manageable because so many different records systems exist \n9  from which to ascertain the members of the class. Liability can be determined on a class-\n10  wide basis. Damages can be determined on a class-wide basis using a damages matrix set \n11  by a jury, or by trying the damages of a statistically valid sample of the class to a jury and \n12  extrapolating those damages to the class as a whole. \n13  48.  In accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 23(b)(3), class members must be \n14  furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual \n15  notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort. Plaintiffs are \n16  informed and believe that LASD computer records contain a last known address for class \n17  members. Plaintiffs contemplate that individual notice be given to class members at such \n18  last known address by first class mail. Plaintiffs contemplate that the notice inform class \n19  members of the following: \n20  A.  The pendency of the class action, and the issues common to the class; \n21  B.  The nature of the action; \n22  C.  Their right to  'opt out' of the action within a given time,  in whic \n23  event they will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action; \n24  D.  Their right, if they do not 'opt out,' to be represented by their owr \n25  counsel and enter an appearance in the case; otherwise, they will be represented b \n26  the named plaintiffs and their counsel; and \n27 \nE.  Their right, if they do not 'opt out,' to share in any recovery in favo \n28 \nof the class, and conversely to be bound by any judgment on the common issues \nadverse to the class. \n11 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 13 of 16   Page ID #:13\n1  49.  Plaintiffs restate and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing and \n2  ensuing paragraphs in each of the following causes of action as if each paragraph was \n3  fully set forth therein. \n4  COUNT ONE- 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 [FOURTH AMENDMENT] \n(All Defendants) \n5 \n6 \n50.  In subjecting plaintiffs and class members to the unnecessary, demeaning, \n7 \nand outrageous intrusive strip and body cavity search, defendants, and each of them, \n8  violated plaintiffs' and class members' rights to be secure in their persons against \n9  unreasonable searches and seizures as guaranteed by the Fourth and Fourteenth \n10  Amendments to the United States Constitution. Therefore, plaintiffs and class members \n11 \nare entitled to bring suit and recover damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n12 \n51.  As a direct and proximate cause of the aforementioned acts, plaintiffs and \n13 \nclass members were damaged in an amount to be proven at trial. \n14 \nCOUNT TWO- 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 [EQUAL PROTECTION] \n15  (All Defendants)  ยท \n16 \n52.  The unequal treatment of men and women- and the unnecessary, \n17 \ndemeaning, and outrageous intrusive strip and body cavity searches inflicted on women \n18 \nbut not men- deprived the female class members of the protections afforded by \n19 \nprovisions of the 14th Amendment Equal Protection guarantees. Therefore, the female \n20 \nplaintiffs and class members are entitled to bring suit and recover damages pursuant to 42 \n21 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983. \n22 \nCOUNT THREE- ARTICLE 1, ยงยง1 AND 13 OF THE CALIFORNIA \n23  CONSTITUTION [PRIVACY/FOURTH AMENDMENT ANALOGUE] \n(All Defendants) \n24 \n25  53.  Plaintiffs filed a Govt. Code ยง910 claim for damages against the defendants \n26  for the matters set forth in this complaint. \n27  54.

Civ. Code ยง52.1 \n12 \n(All Defendants) \n13 \n14  56.  The unnecessary, demeaning, and outrageous intrusive strip and/or visual \n15  body cavity searches alleged herein were accomplished via threat, intimidation or \n16  coercion and/or threats ofthe same. \n17  57.  The unnecessary, demeaning, and outrageous intrusive strip and visual body \n18  cavity searches, and the unequal treatment of women, as opposed to men, deprived \n19  plaintiffs and the class they represent of the protections afforded by provisions of federal \n20  constitutiQnal and state constitutional and statutory law, including but not limited to \n21  rights protected under the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \n22  States Constitution; Article I, ยงยง   1, 7, 13, and 17, of the California state constitution, and \n23  California Penal Code ยง 4030. Therefore, plaintiffs and the class are entitled to bring suit \n24  and recover damages pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code ยง52.1 (b). \n25  58.  As a direct and proximate cause ofthe aforementioned acts, plaintiffs and \n26  class members were damaged in an amount to be proven at trial but in any event not less \n27  than $4,000 per violation pursuant to the provisions of Civil Code ยง52(b ). \n28  59.  The aforementioned acts of defendants directly and proximately caused \n13 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 15 of 16   Page ID #:15\n1  plaintiffs to be deprived of their California constitutional rights as stated above, thereby \n2  entitling plaintiffs and class members to recover damages proximately caused by \n3  defendants' wrongful acts. \n4  COUNT SIX- Violation of Statutory Dnties \n(Penal Code ยง 4030) \n5 \n(Against Defendants County and LASD Only) \n6 \n7  60.  The unnecessary, demeaning, outrageous, and intrusive strip and body cavit \n8  searches, to which plaintiffs and the class members were subjected by defendants, \n9  violated plaintiffs' and the class members' state-law protections guaranteed by California \n10  Penal Code ยง4030. \n11 \n61.  The aforementioned acts of defendants directly and proximately caused the \n12  plaintiffs and the class members to be deprived of their rights as stated above, thereby \n13 \nentitling plaintiffs and class members to recover damages proximately caused by \n14  defendants' wrongful acts, including statutory damages under Penal Code ยง4030. \n15 \nCOUNT SEVEN- Violation of Mandatory Duties \n(Against Defendants County and LASD) \n16 \n17 \n62.  The Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \n18 \nConstitution; Article I, ยงยง 1, 7, 13, and 17, of the California state constitution; California \n19 \nPenal Code ยง4030; and California Civil Code ยง52.1 are enactments. Enactments form the \n20 \nbasis of a mandatory duty under California Government Code ยง815.6. \n21 \n63.  Any California constitutional provision is mandatory and prohibitory, per \n22 \nArticle 1, ยง26, of the California Constitution. \n23 \n64.  These constitutional provisions and statutes apply to all members of the \n24 \ngeneral public, including plaintiffs, and were all designed to prevent the kind of injuries \n25 \nalleged herein. \n26 \n65.  Defendants did not exercise reasonable diligence in discharging their duty \n27 \nto refrain from violating the constitutional rights of plaintiffs and class members. \n28 \n66.  As a direct and proximate cause of the aforementioned acts of defendants, \nplaintiffs and class members were damaged in amounts to be determined at trial. \n14 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 1   Filed 03/05/10   Page 16 of 16   Page ID #:16\n1  VII.

No. 327) (collectively โPlaintiffsโ) and Defendants County of Los \nAngeles (โthe Countyโ), the Los Angeles Sheriffโs Department, its prior Sheriff, \nLeroy Baca, and Sammy Jones, Timothy Cornell, John H. Clark, Stacey Lee, \nDennis Burns, Gerald K. Cooper and Daniel Cruz (collectively โDefendantsโ), by \nand through their respective counsel, hereby submit the following Settlement \nAgreement (โSettlement Agreementโ).  Plaintiffs and Defendants are referred to \ncollectively herein as โthe Parties.โ \n1 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 3 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14024\n  I.  RECITALS \nPlaintiffs are former inmates at the Century Regional Detention Facility \n(โCRDFโ), a jail facility operated by the Los Angeles County Sheriffโs Department \n(โLASDโ), which houses female convicted inmates and pretrial detainees.  \nPlaintiffs filed this action in the United States District Court for the Central \nDistrict of California (โCourtโ) on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly \nsituated inmates on March 5, 2010.  \nPlaintiffs alleged various violations of the Federal and State Constitutions, of \n42 U.S.C. ยง1983, and California Civil Code ยง52.1 associated with the LASDโs \nstrip/visual body cavity search practices at CRDF during the class period.  \nThe  District  Court,  after  multiple  hearings  and  several  class  certification \norders that went through a number of iterations, certified the class on November 18, \n2016. See, Doc No. 327 (Order Granting Renewed Motion For Class Certification). \nThe certification was for liability only under Fed.R.Civ.P Rule (c)(4). \n On June 6, 2017, the District Court granted summary judgment on liability \nissues to the Plaintiff class on their claim for Monell liability under the Fourth \nAmendment,  and  dismissed  claims  against  the  individual  Defendants,  finding \nqualified  immunity  applied.  .  See,  Doc  No.  361.  The  District  Courtโs  liability \nsummary judgment ruling found it unnecessary to address changed conditions at \n \nCRDF because the searches violated the Fourth Amendment for the whole Class \nDamages  Period.  The  changes  in  conditions  are  nonetheless  factored  into  this \nSettlement. \nSubsequently, the Parties entered into a protracted armโs length mediation \nprocess with the assistance of Retired United States District Judge George King, \nincluding  three  in-person  mediation  sessions  with  Judge  King  and  numerous \ntelephonic sessions (both the Parties separately with Judge King and among the \nParties and Judge King).  \nThe Parties have reached a proposed Settlement subject to the approval of the \nCourt.  It  is  understood  and  agreed  that  this  Settlement  is  the  compromise  of \n2 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 4 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14025\n  disputed claims by the Named Plaintiffs and Class Members, and that the payments \nmade are not to be construed as an admission of liability by any of the Defendants. \nThe Defendants deny liability, preserve all defenses they have asserted or could \npresent in these proceedings or any future appeal, and intend merely to avoid the \nexpense of further litigation.  \nIn summary, this Settlement provides for dismissal of this case with prejudice \nin exchange for a non-reversionary Class Fund of $53 Million, from which costs of \nadministration, litigation costs and attorneyโs fees will be paid, and the remainder \nof which would be distributed to Class Members who make viable claims subject to \ncertain requirements for a minimum number of claims made (or a portion of funds \nwould go to cy pres distributions as defined herein).  \nAs a form of indirect compensation to absent Class Members, up to $3 \nmillion of the Class Fund will be used to fund contracts between the County of Los \nAngeles, on the one hand, the Moss Group and the Center for Gender and Justice \n(โCGJโ), on the other hand (the โMoss/CGJ Contractsโ). Both organizations have \nsignificant experience in assisting local, state, and national correctional agencies in \nthe development of gender-responsive and trauma-informed practices, \nprogramming, and services. The purpose of the contracts shall be to help develop a \nstrengthened model of gender-responsive policy and operational practice at all \n \nLASD facilities that house female inmates (including CRDF and Twin Towers), \nwhile enhancing the culture of safety and respect for both staff and the inmate \npopulation. The contracts will include preliminary assessment/evaluation, and may \nalso include the provision of expertise, leadership, technical assistance, and services \nin the following areas: system analysis/operations, policy review and development, \nstrategic planning, program development/inmate services, training/culture, and \nongoing assessment. The Moss/CGJ contracts shall be secured in furtherance of the \nLos Angeles County Board of Supervisorsโ effort to facilitate the design and \nimplementation of gender-responsive systems within the Los Angeles County \ncriminal justice system, as reflected in the Board of Supervisorsโ February 2019 \n3 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 5 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14026\n  motion titled โBuilding a Gender-Responsive Criminal Justice System.โ  \nII.

The โMinimum Remainderโ is a figure \nused for purposes of determining whether cy pres payments are made and is \nbased on the estimate of the maximum fees to be sought (1/3 of the $53 \nMillion  Fund),  estimated  litigation  and  class  administration  costs  ($1.5 \n7 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 9 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14030\n  Million),  and  the  Moss/CGJ  Contracts  (maximum  $3  Million);  thus  the \nMinimum  Remainder  is  estimated  to  amount  to  $30,883,000,  which  the \nParties agree to round up to $31,000,000.  \n25.  The โSettlementโ refers to this agreement. \n26.  A โSettlement Class Memberโ (โSCMโ) means any Class Member as \ndefined above (whether or not she files a Timely Claim form), including \nrepresentatives, successors and assigns, who does not file a valid and timely \nRequest for Exclusion as provided for in this Settlement Agreement.  \n27.  The โSettlement Fundโ is the fund established by the Administrator with \nfunds transferred from Defendants from which the damages to the Class \nRepresentatives and Class Members will be paid.  The Defendants will pay \nall moneys they are obligated to pay under the Preliminary Approval Order, \nand the settlement approved by the Court, if any, into the Settlement Fund.    \n28.  โStrip Searchโ means a search conducted by LASD personnel on a Class \nMember (as defined above) in which the person was required to remove her \nclothing, including underwear, in the presence of a corrections officer \nand/or expose her breasts, genitals or body cavities for a visual inspection. \nAll persons appearing on the Class Member List were subjected to a strip \nsearch as defined herein.  \n \n29.  A โTimely Claimโ is one filed a) within the 150-day window provided by \nthe notice to be sent to the class, and b) to the extent the Court approves, \nlate claims (i.e., claims filed after the Class Notice period) that are filed \nprior to the Final Approval Hearing. \nIII.  DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY \n1.  The Parties acknowledge and agree that all undertakings and \nagreements contained in this Settlement Agreement have been agreed to solely for \nthe purpose of finally compromising all questions, disputes and issues between \nthem relating to the litigation. This Settlement Agreement and any proceedings \ntaken pursuant hereto shall not in any event be construed as, interpreted as, or \n8 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 10 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14031\n  deemed to be evidence of an admission or concession by either party for any \npurpose, or deemed to constitute a waiver of any legal position or any defenses or \nother rights which the Parties might otherwise assert in any context. Neither this \nSettlement Agreement nor any provision contained therein, nor any documents \nrelated hereto, nor any negotiations, statements or testimony taken in connection \nherewith may be offered or received as evidence, or used for any other purpose, or \nin any suit, action or legal proceeding which either of them have or in the future \nmay have with any other person, as an admission or concession of liability or \nwrongdoing on the part of either party, except in connection with any action or \nlegal proceeding to enforce this Settlement Agreement. The Parties have reached \nthis Settlement through arms-length negotiations and to avoid the costs and delays \nof further disputes, litigation and negotiations among them and after extensive \nnegotiations with an independent mediator, subject to approval by the Court. This \nSettlement Agreement has been entered into without any concession of liability or \nnon-liability whatsoever and has no precedential or evidentiary value whatsoever. \nIV.  FINANCIAL TERMS OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND CLASS \nDAMAGES ALLOCATION FORMULA \n2.  The Class Fund is the amount of $53,000,000. The class administration \ncosts shall be paid out of that fund, as will any incentive awards to the Class \n \nRepresentatives as approved by the Court. (Class Counselโs Litigation Costs will be \naddressed in Class Counselโs Motion for Attorneyโs Fees and Costs.) The \nRemainder of the Class Fund shall be distributed to the Class Members (including \nNamed Plaintiffs/Class Representatives) under the formula terms provided in this \nAgreement.   \n3.  Subject to approval of the Court at the hearing regarding the Final \nOrder of Approval and Settlement, the following incentive awards shall be paid to \nthe Named Plaintiffs (in addition to the share of the Class Fund to which they are \nentitled as Class Members). Class Counsel represent that they have no prior \nagreement with any Named Plaintiff to seek such awards, nor do they have any \n9 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 11 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14032\n  commitment to propose them. They are proposed at the initiative of Class Counsel \nand are intended to reflect Named Plaintiffsโ commitment to, and active assistance \nin advancing, this Lawsuit since it was filed in 2010: \nNAME  INCENTIVE AWARD \nMary Amador  $10,000 \nLora Barranca  $10,000 \nAlisa Battiste  $10,000 \nNancy Briseรฑo  $10,000 \nFelice (Cholewiak) Vargas  $10,000 \nEvangelina Madrid  $10,000 \nDiana Paiz  $10,000 \nDiane Vigil  $10,000 \nMyeshia Williams  $10,000 \nTOTAL  $90,000 \n4.  It is not currently possible to determine the amount of the Remainder \nbefore the hearing regarding the Final Order of Approval and Settlement, where the \nfinal amount of Class Counselโs Attorneyโs Fees and Costs awards, class \nadministration costs, and the Moss/CGJ Contracts will be determined.  \n5.  The formula for distribution of the Remainder has been developed by \n  Class Counsel and, if approved by the Court, will be summarized in the Class \nNotice to be sent to Class Members. The formula is designed to account for the fact \nthat the alleged severity of challenged conditions varied depending on the time \nperiod the Strip Search occurred (with the most intrusive conditions before July \n2011 and least intrusive conditions after February 2014 when the bus bay became \nenclosed and had heating), the number of Strip Searches an inmate experienced and \nthe weather conditions when the Strip Search occurred.  \n6.  To briefly summarize, Class Counselโs assessment of these variations \nin conditions, which are factored into the class damages allocation formula, are as \nfollows: \n10 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 12 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14033\n  TIME PERIOD  CONDITIONS \n2/26/2014 โ 1/31/2015   Conditions: \n \n(Core Conditions \n (1) female inmates required to participate in \nApplicable to All Class \ngroup Strip Searches in which the labia lift \nMembers Regardless of \nprocedure was used; \nTime Period) \n(2) female inmates required to publicly identify if \nthey were menstruating, remove feminine \n \nhygiene products in view of other inmates; \nand  \n \n(3) female inmates required to expose their naked \nbody โ including bare pubic region and bare \nbreasts โ in the presence of a group. \n (4) inmates searched in groups of 24 inmates (or \nmore, see below). \n4/1/2013 โ 2/25/2014  Conditions: \nโข  All above conditions \nplus \nโข  Group Strip Searches occurred in a converted  \nbus garage with a chain link fence roof with a \ntarp on it and no heaters. \n7/1/2011 โ 3/30/20131  Conditions: \n  โข  All above conditions \n  plus \nโข  Inmates searched in groups larger than 24 \ninmates \nโข  Inmates required to put clothing directly on \nthe ground. \n3/5/2008 โ 6/30/2011  Conditions: \nโข  All above conditions \nplus \nโข  Deputies simultaneously searched both lines \nof female inmates so that inmates were \ndirectly viewing each other during the Strip \n                                                           \n1 This subclass was because LASD reduced its class sizes to a maximum of 25 and installed tables \non which clothes could be placed in April 2013. \n11 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 13 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14034\n  TIME PERIOD  CONDITIONS \nSearch. \n \n \n7.  Based on the above considerations, Class Counsel have devised a \ndistribution model in which Class Members are compensated based on the number \nof Strip Searches they endured, with searches weighted based on the time period in \nwhich they occurred (which, in turn, corresponds to the severity of conditions). \nEach Strip Search is assigned a point-value which will translate to a per-diem dollar \nvalue at the time of distribution.  Class Members receive the designated number of \npoints based on the number of Strip Searches in each category.  \n8.  The chart below shows the categories, conditions associated with each \ncategory, and points assigned to each category.  \nTime Period  Points Per Strip Search  \n3/8/2008 โ 6/30/2011  100 \n7/1/2011 โ 3/31/2013  90 \n4/1/2013 โ 2/25/2014  80 \n \n2/26/2014 โ 1/31/2015  70 \n  9.  The distribution model also provides an additional 10-points for any \nStrip Search conducted at a temperature of 70 degrees or less.  \n10.  The per-search points are assigned to each Class Member, up to their \n50th search. The โ50-search capโ applies to less than .04% of the Class. This cap is \nto ensure that outliers who have outsized claims do not distort the meaningfulness \nof the recovery to the remaining Class Members. (Such outliers would be entitled to \nopt out and pursue their own claims if they so choose.) \n11.  That Class Memberโs point total is the sum of all their assigned points. \nThe final distribution will be based on the total points for each Class Member who \nfiled claims, divided by individual points assigned to each claiming Class Member. \n12 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 14 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14035\n  (If, for example, there is a total of 1,000,000 points for the aggregated Timely \nClaims, and Class Member โXโ had a total of 200 points, Class Member โXโ would \nreceive .02% (or .0002) of the Remainder; if the Remainder is the Minimum \nRemainder of $31 Million, that Class Members would receive $6,200).  These \nfigures are purely hypothetical and should not be considered as reflective of any \nlikely award. Because it is anticipated that not all Class Members will make Timely \nClaims, and this is a non-reversionary fund (except as provided in Section VI, \nbelow, for cy pres payments in the event of a low claim rate, which the Parties do \nnot anticipate), a claiming Class Memberโs share of the Remainder will be \ndetermined based on that Class Memberโs share of the total points for Class \nMembers who made Timely Claims.  \n12.  No Class Member who filed a Timely Claim will receive less than \n$200 (the minimum will be at least $200 but may be adjusted upwards) subject to \nthe limit of the Class Funds available in the Remainder. The minimum provision is \ndesigned to ensure that all Class Members who submit Timely Claims receive some \nrecovery.  \n13.  None of the Class Fund shall revert to the County. Accordingly, as \nexplained above, the money per Class Member making a Timely Claim will \nincrease proportionately to the extent that fewer Class Members make a claim.  \n \n14.  Class Counsel intend to submit a separate Motion for Attorneyโs Fees \nand Costs to be heard at the hearing regarding a Final Order of Approval and \nSettlement, to be analyzed under the standards for an award of fees and costs to a \nprevailing plaintiff under the percentage of the fund doctrine. While the motion will \nseek a percentage of the Class Fund as a fee award, subsumed within that request \nwill be any statutory attorneyโs fee to which Class Counsel would be entitled under \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 or Cal. Civil Code ยง 52.1(h). The Class Notice will advise Class \nMembers of Motion for Attorneyโs Fees and Costs and their right to object to it.  \n15.  The LASD represents that to the best of its knowledge, it has provided \nall the electronic data in its possession, which it is legally authorized to produce, \n13 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 15 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14036\n  regarding Class Members necessary to both identify and contact Class Members. \nThe LASD shall provide to the Administrator, to the extent that such information \nhas not already been provided, any such additional information in its possession \nwhich it is legally authorized to produce. Such information shall include date of \nbirth, social security number (SSN), driverโs license/state ID number, and most \nrecent contact information (address, phone and any other available contact \ninformation). In addition, LASD shall provide to the Administrator and Class \nCounsel the data from the Automated Justice Information System (โAJISโ) \nReleased-to-Agency field indicating whether  a Class Member was released to the \ncustody of another law enforcement agency. This information may only be used to \nreach out to Class Members to ensure they receive the Class Notice and are aware \nof how to file a claim pursuant to this Agreement.  LASD will make a written \nrequest to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (โCDCRโ), \nwhich request will include a list of Class Members who were transferred to CDCR \nfrom LASD custody, and request that CDCR:  (1) advise the Administrator of \nwhere and how the Class Notice to those Class Members still in CDCR physical \ncustody should be sent; and (2) provide the Administrator with the most recent \ncontact information in CDCRโs records (including records in the Division of Adult \nParole Operations, where applicable) for each Class Members who is no longer in \n \nCDCR physical custody. When making the foregoing request to CDCR, LASD will \nprovide to CDCR any individualized identifying information in its possession that it \nis legally authorized to include that could assist CDCR in identifying Class \nMembers. \nIf CDCR provides a response, LASD will then advise Class Counsel of \nCDCRโs response, and if CDCR either fails to respond or refuses to provide \nassistance, Class Counsel may seek Court assistance in securing the cooperation of \nCDCR to effectuate service of the Class Notice and to obtain the most up to date \ncontact information for Class Members.  Neither the County nor the LASD will \nhave any further obligation with respect to efforts to obtain contact information for \n14 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 16 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14037\n  Class Members from CDCR beyond the efforts described above, except that it will \nengage in any reasonable follow-up requested by CDCR.  LASD will likewise have \nno further obligation to assist with securing cooperation regarding the provision of \nClass Notice to Class Members still in CDCR custody. \nNothing in this agreement precludes Plaintiffs from seeking a court order \nauthorizing the LASD to provide CII and FBI numbers directly to CDCR as part of \nefforts to identify Class Members and provide Class Notice to individuals who were \npreviously transferred to CDCR. Should Plaintiffs file such a motion, they will \nserve the Attorney General of the State of California and the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation with the motion in order to provide each with the opportunity to be \nheard. Plaintiffs will not seek access to such records for themselves or for the \nAdministrator.  \nV.  RELEASES AND OTHER SETTLEMENT TERMS \n16.  The Parties enter into this Agreement solely for the purposes of this \nSettlement and implementation of the Settlement. If the Settlement fails to be \napproved or otherwise fails consummation, then this Settlement Agreement is \nhereby withdrawn.   \n17.  An SCM who complies with the requirements set forth in this \nSettlement Agreement and files a Timely Claim form will be paid specified sums \n \ndetermined by the distribution process set forth above, which payment shall be in \nfull satisfaction of all claims of that SCM. \n18.  The Settlement Agreement, as of the Effective Date, resolves in full all \nclaims against the Released Persons by all of the SCMs, including the Named \nPlaintiffs, involving violations of law or constitutional rights, including, without \nlimitation, their equal protection rights under federal and California law, their rights \nunder 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and California Civil Code ยง 52.1, any other rights under \nany other federal, state or local law, regulation, duty, or obligation, or any other \nlegal theory, action or cause of action, which arise from the class-wide factual \nallegations alleged in the Fourth Amended Complaint, which is the operative \n15 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 17 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14038\n  pleading in this matter ( โCovered Claimsโ). \n19.  When the Settlement Agreement is final, as of the Effective Date, all \nSCMs, including the Named Plaintiffs, waive all rights to any and all claims \nrelating to damages or reimbursement of any kind for the Covered Claims. This \nwaiver and release shall include a full release and waiver of unknown rights \nregarding the Covered Claims that may exist as of the Effective Date.  \n20.  As of the Effective Date, the SCMs, including the Named Plaintiffs, \nhereby waive any and all rights to pursue, initiate, prosecute, or commence any \naction or proceeding before any court, administrative agency or other tribunal, or to \nfile any complaint regarding acts or omissions by the Released Persons with respect \nto the Covered Claims during the class period; and further, as it relates to this \nwaiver or Release, expressly waive the provisions of California Civil Code ยง 1542, \nwhich provides that โa general release does not extend to claims which the creditor \ndoes not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the \nrelease, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her \nsettlement with the debtor.โ \n21.  This Settlement Agreement, together with its exhibits, contains all the \nterms and conditions agreed upon by the Parties regarding the subject matter of the \ninstant proceeding, and no oral agreement entered into at any time nor any written \n \nagreement entered into prior to the execution of this Settlement Agreement shall be \ndeemed to exist, or to bind the Parties, or to vary the terms and conditions \ncontained herein, except as expressly provided herein. \n22.  Each SCM shall be deemed to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the \nCourt. \n23.  This Settlement Agreement is subject to and conditioned on entry by \nthe Court of a Final Order of Approval and Settlement and the issuance of the final \norder of dismissal by the Court, providing the specified relief as set forth below, \nwhich relief shall be pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Settlement \nAgreement and the Partiesโ performance of their continuing rights and obligations \n16 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 18 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14039\n  hereunder. The Final Order of Approval and Settlement shall be deemed final on \nthe Effective Date. Such Final Order of Approval and Settlement shall: \na.  Dismiss with prejudice all claims in the action as to the Released Persons \nincluding  all  claims  for  monetary  damages,  declaratory  relief  and \ninjunctive  relief,  each  side  to  bear  its  own  costs  and  fees  except  as \notherwise provided for in this Settlement Agreement; \nb.  Order that all SCMs are enjoined from asserting against any Released \nPerson any and all claims that any SCM had, has or may have in the \nfuture based on the Covered Claims; \nc.  Release each Released Person from the claims that any SCM has, had or \nmay have in the future against such Released Person arising out of the \nCovered Claims; \nd.  Determine that this Settlement Agreement is entered into in good faith, is \nreasonable, fair and adequate, and in the best interest of the Class; and \ne.  Reserve the Courtโs continuing and exclusive jurisdiction over the Parties \nto  this  Settlement  Agreement,  including  Defendants  and  SCMs,  to \nadminister, supervise, construe and enforce the Settlement Agreement in \naccordance with its terms for the mutual benefit of all Parties. \n24.  The Parties will take all necessary and appropriate steps to obtain \n \npreliminary and final approvals of the Settlement Agreement, and dismissal of the \naction with prejudice, all Parties bearing their own fees and costs unless otherwise \nset forth in this Settlement Agreement. If the Court gives final approval of this \nSettlement Agreement, and if there is an appeal from such decision, the Parties will \ndefend the Settlement Agreement. \nVI.  CY PRES DISTRIBUTION IN THE EVENT OF A LOW CLAIM RATE \n25.  In order to ensure that Class Members do not receive a windfall \nbecause there are relatively few claims filed, the Parties agree that, if the total \nclaims do not amount to the Minimum Remainder based on the following formula, \nthe difference between those aggregated claims and Minimum Remainder will go to \n17 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 19 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14040\n  the organizations identified in ยถ 30. The formula to determine whether such cy pres \npayments are to be made (referred to as the โCy Pres Formulaโ shall be as follows: \nCY PRES FORMULA \n# SEARCHES  AMOUNT \n1-3  $5,000 \n4-6  $10,000 \n7-10  $15,000 \n11+  $20,000 \n \n26.   Thus, by way of example only, if the Minimum Remainder is $31 \nMillion, 4000 Class Members filed claims (which the Parties agree is likely a low \nclaim rate), and the average of their claims based on the Cy Pres Formula amounted \nto $9000 per claimant, the total would be $36,000,000, and no cy pres distribution \nwould apply. In contrast, if 3000 people filed claims based on the same average \n$9000 per claimant and same $31 Million Minimum Remainder, then $4,000,000 \n(the difference between the $31 Million Minimum Remainder and the $27,000,000 \nclaimed amount based on the Cy Pres Formula), would go to the Cy Pres Fund. \n27.  The foregoing formula only applies in the event that the total claims do \nnot amount to the Minimum Remainder based on the Cy Pres Formula. Otherwise, \nthe allocation formula set out in Section IV, above, applies. \n \n28.    The Cy Pres funds will not be returned to the Countyโs general fund \nbut will instead be provided to non-profit organizations or programs which provide \ngender-responsive services to female inmates in LASD custody.  At the time that it \nis determined that any Cy Pres funds are to be distributed, counsel for the Parties in \nthis case and the LA County Board of Supervisors will work in good faith to \nidentify the organizations or programs to receive those funds.  If they cannot agree, \nthe Parties will separately brief the Court, and the Court will determine the \norganizations and/or programs to which the Cy Pres funds will be paid. \nVII.  RESOLUTION AND PAYMENT OF CLAIMS \n29.  Defendants agree to the division of funds between Incentive Awards \n18 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 20 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14041\n  and the Remainder as proposed by Class Counsel subject to the approval of the \nCourt.  \nVIII. CLASS COUNSEL FEES \n30.  Class Counsel will file a Motion for Attorneyโs Fees and Costs on a \npercentage of the fund basis, and the payment of said fees and costs is subject to \nCourt approval. Class Counsel will not seek more than 1/3 of the $53 Million Class \nFund as the amount of attorneyโs fees requested; Class Counsel may seek less but \nmay not seek more. (This 1/3 cap is separate from Class Counselโs costs, i.e., Class \nCounsel may request up to 1/3 of the Class Fund plus costs.) \nIX.  CLASS ADMINISTRATOR \n31.  Counsel for the Parties will jointly agree on the selection of the Class \nAdministrator and, if they cannot so agree, will submit their suggestions to the \nCourt and the Court will determine the Administrator.  The Parties understand the \nimportance of a rapid process for choosing the Class Administrator and are \ncommitted to reaching a joint selection as soon as practicable. \n32.  The Administrator shall be responsible for taking any steps deemed \nappropriate and necessary by Class Counsel to notify the Class Members of their \nrights to file claims, and to assist them in doing so. Class Notice shall be issued \nelectronically by email and text message (for all Class Members whose email \n \naddresses and mobile phone numbers can be and have been obtained) by the date \nset in the Preliminary Approval Order for the initial mailing of Class Notice. On \nthat same date, Class Notice shall be provided by regular mail for all Class \nMembers for whom an email address and mobile phone number have not been \nobtained, for all incarcerated Class Members.  \n33.  For those Class Members whose initial Class Notice was sent by the \ncombination of email and text message who have not responded by filing either a \nclaim or an Opt Out within 30 days, they will be sent by regular mail the Class \nNotice previously provided to the other Class Members whose Class Notice was \nsent by regular mail, along with a statement that they were sent by email and text \n19 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 21 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14042\n  message a Class Notice as well, and this is being sent to ensure that they have seen \nthe Class Notice. (See, ยถ 40 for elaboration.) \n34.  The Administratorโs duty shall include the use of normal and \ncustomary means to search for a Class Memberโs email addresses, mobile phone \nnumbers and last known mailing addresses, including the use of a postal database \nand other specialized databases, when mail is returned. As indicated above, the \nAdministrator shall initially send electronic copies of the Class Notice to any \ninmates for whom email addresses and mobile telephone numbers are ascertainable \nand at the same time send a hardcopy version and claim form to any Class Member \nwhose email and mobile phone numbers are not ascertainable, as well as any Class \nMembers who are currently incarcerated in California State prisons. (The \nAdministrator is responsible for making reasonable efforts to determine Class \nMembers who are now incarcerated in California state prisons). The Administrator \nwill also propose economically viable and likely productive forms of notice through \nthe use of social media and online advertising.  \n35.  Beginning when it is first retained after the Court approves its \nappointment, the Administrator will begin to obtain as many Class Member email \naddresses and mobile phone numbers as reasonably possible. Before the filing of \nthe Motion for Preliminary Approval, the Administrator will advise the Parties and \n \nthe Court of when the Administrator believes it can reasonably obtain available \nClass Member email addresses, phone numbers and mailing addresses, and the date \nfor mailing the Class Notice shall be set with that time in mind.  \n36.  Notice shall proceed as follows: \n1) Initial Class Notice shall commence with email and text notices \nfor all Class Members whose email addresses and/or mobile \nphone numbers are ascertainable (assuming both are \nascertainable, Class Members will receive two forms of \nelectronic notice; if either the email address or mobile phone \nnumber cannot be obtained, the notice will be sent via the \n20 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 22 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14043\n  available means).  \n2) On the same day, notice by regular mail shall be sent to all Class \nMembers for whom either an email address or mobile phone \nnumber or both could not be ascertained. This means that all \nClass Members will receive the Class Notice by either (1) email \nand text; or (2) regular mail plus either email or text (assuming \none of the two is available); or (3) regular mail only (for those \nwhose email and mobile phone numbers cannot be located).   \n3) Thirty days after the initial issuance of Class Notice, the \nAdministrator will send notice by regular mail to all Class \nMembers who were initially notified only by electronic means \nonly (those who received notice by email and text) and who have \nnot yet submitted claim forms along with the explanation that \nthey were sent such electronic notice but this notice is being sent \nas well because they did not file a claim or exclude themselves \nfrom the settlement.  \n4) Throughout the notice period, the Administrator shall continue \nto send email and text notice if and when it learns additional \nemail addresses/phone numbers for Class Members.  \n \n5) Where Class Notice is sent by email or text, the Class \nAdministrator will periodically remind Class Members through \nemail/text blasts to file claims. (If possible, procedures shall be \nimplemented to remove Class Members from email/text blasts \nwho have submitted claims). \n37.  The Administrator shall complete the initial Class Notice within two \nconsecutive business days. The second day of such mailing is the first day of the \nperiod for calculating the โBar Dateโ (defined previously). That mailing shall occur \nas soon as practicable after the settlement has been Preliminarily Approved and no \nlater than the date set by the Court.  \n21 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 23 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14044\n  38.  The Class Notice shall describe the particulars of the case, provide the \nclass definition, provide information for claimants to contact the Administrator for \na claim form, notify Class Members of establishment of a case website, and contain \nother usual and customary information. The proposed Class Notice is attached to \nthis Settlement Agreement as Exhibit B. \n39.  The Administrator will include in its bid a line item for the cost of \nobtaining from CDCR the identities of Class Members in CDCR custody to whom \nClass Notice should be sent at their CDCR housing location.  \n40.  The Parties discussed and presently do not intend to publish Class \nNotice in local newspapers because experience has shown that such notice is of \nlittle value in notifying Class Members. Instead, mail, email and text notice will be \nsupplemented through summary publication in Prison Legal News (a publication \nwidely distributed to inmates throughout the country); and through selective social \nmedia/online outreach directly targeting Class Membersโ Facebook and/or \nInstagram accounts.  \n41.  If specifically requested by Plaintiffsโ counsel, the Defendants will \nseek to obtain the cooperation of CDCR (subject to the limitations set forth in \nParagraph 15), and the Los Angeles County Probation Department to assist in \nlocating Class Members, including, where Defendants believe legally permissible, \n \nproviding more recent contact information for Class Members. The LASD will \nadvise on its website of the existence of this Settlement and place a link on the \nwebsite to connect viewers to the Administratorโs website. The LASD will also \npost physical copies of the Class Notice (Exhibit โBโ) in CRDF Reception and Day \nRooms. \n42.  The request for bid to potential Administrators included requests for \nall such potential activities as well as suggestions for other ways of reaching \npotential Class Members. That request for bid also requested economically viable \nproposals for means by which Class Members can receive payment through \nelectronic means rather than by check. There will also be requests to nonprofits that \n22 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 24 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14045\n  address criminal justice reform, reentry or programs for former inmates to provide \nnotice on their websites and to their mailing lists.  \nX.  CLASS ADMINISTRATION FOR PROOF OF CLAIM FORMS AND \nPAYMENT SCHEDULE \n43.  The Administrator shall be responsible for providing and receiving \nProof of Claim Forms in paper and electronic format. The Administrator shall \ndetermine Class Membership and the amount of monies due each timely claiming \nClass Member based on the formula contained in Section IV.  \n44.  A Proof of Claim Form shall be deemed timely submitted under \nsubsection (a) of Definition # 29 (Timely Claim) when received by the \nAdministrator, or postmarked, on or before the Bar Date. Facsimile or electronic \nmail filings are acceptable and timely so long as they clearly indicate the case on \nwhich the claim is filed and are received on or before the Bar Date.  \n45.  If a Class Member submits a Claim Form that is deficient in some \nrespect, the Administrator shall provide written notice by First Class Mail and a 30-\nday time limit to provide a proper Claim Form, which notice shall inform the Class \nMember of what she must do in order to submit a proper claim. Failure to cure the \ndeficiency within the 30-day time limit will bar any further rights for consideration \nof eligibility to make a valid claim. So long as the original claim is received on or \n \nbefore the Bar Date, it shall be considered timely under sub-section (a) of \nDefinition # 30 (Timely Claim) if any deficiency is cured within 30 days of the \nmailing of a notice of deficiency. \n46.  Claim Forms received after the Bar Date shall be rejected. The \nAdministrator will notify claimants of the rejection of untimely Claims. \n47.  The $53 Million payment shall be made in three equal installments, the \nfirst of which shall be made 30 days after the Effective Date, the second of which \nshall be made twelve months after the first payment, and the third of which shall be \nmade twelve months after the second payment. \n48.  The costs of Class Administration through the Final Order of Approval \n23 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 25 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14046\n  and Settlement and the first round of distribution of checks will be taken from the \nfirst payment; 1/3 of the costs of the Moss/CGJ Contracts shall be taken (or held for \nthat purpose by the Administrator) from each payment. \n49.  For each payment, 1/3 of the total Attorneyโs Fees and Costs awarded \nby the Court to Class Counsel shall be paid into the KMBL Client Trust Account \nand the remaining funds shall be paid to the Class Administrator for distribution \nunder the terms of this Agreement. \n50.  The Class Administrator shall take its accrued and reasonably \nprojected costs of administration for that round from the second and third round of \npayments. \n51.  In addition to the first round of payment to qualifying Class Members, \nthe Administrator will advise them of the estimated time of payments to be made in \nthe second and third rounds and advise Class Members to keep them apprised of \nany address changes. \n52.  The Administrator shall make the first round of payments to SCMs \nwho have filed Timely Claims as ultimately determined by the Court in accordance \nwith this Settlement Agreement within a reasonable time not to exceed 90 days \nafter the Effective Date.  \n53.  If a check to an SCM is not cashed within three months of its mailing, \n \nthe Administrator shall hold the funds for nine additional months, during which \ntime it shall make reasonable efforts to contact the person to whom the uncashed \ncheck was written to make arrangements for its cashing or reissuance. The \nAdministrator shall not make any payment to any SCM until all claims have been \nsubmitted to the Administrator pursuant to the terms of this Settlement Agreement.  \n54.  Any SCM funds not cashed within one year of a checkโs initial mailing \nshall be voided, and those funds (โUncashed Fundsโ) shall held for the next round \nof payments. Where an SCMโs check was not cashed within that one year period, \nthat SCM shall be eliminated as a qualifying Class Member, and that SCMโs past \nand future funds shall become part of the fund for future distribution to Class \n24 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 26 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14047\n  Members, and allocated to the remaining SCMโs during the next round of payments \naccording to the Class Damages Allocation Formula contained in Section IV.  \n55.  Uncashed funds remaining in the Class Fund one year after the third \nround of payments shall be given as a donation to the Cy Pres Fund (see ยถ 30), to \nbe allocated equally among the qualifying organizations/ programs. \nXI.    EXCLUSION FROM SETTLEMENT CLASSโOPT OUTS  \n56.  Any Class Member who wishes to be excluded from this Settlement \nmust submit a request to be excluded from the class, a process defined herein as \nโOpt-Out.โ The request for exclusion must be delivered to the Administrator, or \npostmarked, on or before the Bar Date or as the Court may otherwise direct.  \n57.  Although Named Plaintiffs are entitled to Opt-Out of the Settlement, \nPlaintiffsโ counsel has conferred with each of them, and they all approve of and \nsupport the settlement, and have advised that they do not intend to Opt-Out. \n58.  Each Class Member who chooses to Opt-Out from or object to this \nSettlement shall be deemed to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court with \nrespect to his/her claim. \n59.  Any Class Member who does not Opt-Out as set forth in this \nSettlement Agreement, shall be deemed conclusively to have become an SCM and \nto be bound by the Settlement Agreement and all subsequent proceedings, orders \n \nand judgments herein, regardless of whether s/he files a claim form.  \n60.  Any Class Member who exercises an Opt-Out shall not share in any \nmonetary benefits provided by this Settlement Agreement. \n61.  The Administrator will periodically report to Defendantsโ counsel and \nClass Counsel regarding all Opt-Outs received and will determine and report to \ncounsel the total number of Opt-Outs no later than 10 days after the Bar Date.  \n62.  If the total number of Opt-Outs exceeds 250 individuals, Defendants, \nin their sole discretion, may rescind this Settlement Agreement. In exercising this \nright of rescission, Defendants shall provide the Administrator and Class Counsel \nwith written notice of rescission within 20 days after receipt of the Administratorโs \n25 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 27 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14048\n  report providing the total number of Opt-Outs. In the event Defendants exercise the \nright of rescission in accordance with this paragraph, any funds paid or deposited \npursuant to this Settlement Agreement shall be returned to Defendants within 10 \ndays of the rescission, less any expenses, fees and costs incurred by the \nAdministrator.  Rescission shall return the Case to active litigation status. \nXII.  APPROVALS REQUIRED \n63.  The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has approved the terms \nof this Settlement although, after Final Approval, it will have to finally approve the \nFinal Order of Approval and Settlement. \nXIII. DISPUTE RESOLUTION \n64.  In the event of any disputes regarding implementation of the \nSettlement Agreement as set forth herein, they shall be resolved by the Court.  \nXIV.  THE MOSS/CGJ CONTRACTS \n65.  Plaintiffs and Class Counsel agree that the Moss/CGJ Contracts constitute \nSubsequent Remedial Measures in response to the events underlying this litigation \npursuant to Rule 407 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (and similar statue statutes \nlike California Evidence Code ยง 1151). Plaintiffs and Class Counsel also agree that \nany reports generated by the Moss Group or CGJ pursuant to contracts entered into \nunder the terms of this Settlement Agreement are statements of those entities and do \n \nnot constitute party statements of Los Angeles County or the LASD within the \nmeaning of Rule 801 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (and similar statue statutes \nlike California Evidence Code ยง 1220).  \n66.  The initial reports prepared by the Moss Group or CGJ paid for by \nfunds provided under this Settlement Agreement will be provided to the Board of \nSupervisors and to Class Counsel. Class Counsel will also receive copies of the \nnon-privileged portions of follow up reports back to the Board about the Moss \nGroup/CGJ Reports or Contracts by any County agencies. All such reports provided \nto Class Counsel shall be confidential and will not be publicized or disclosed to any \nother party, except to the extent they have been made public by the Board.  \n26 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 387-2   Filed 07/16/19   Page 28 of 31   Page ID\n \n #:14049\n  67.  Any reports prepared by the Moss Group or CGJ are their analyses and \nrecommendations. Nothing in this Agreement requires that they be accepted or \nimplemented by Defendants, who reserve the right to decline to implement any \nrecommendation made in the Moss/CGJ Contracts for any reasons. \nXV.  INTEGRATION \n68.  This Settlement Agreement supersedes all prior communications \nregarding the matters contained herein between the Parties or their representatives. \nThis Settlement Agreement is an integrated agreement and contains the entire \nagreement regarding the matters herein between the Parties, and no representations, \nwarranties or promises have been made or relied on by any party hereto other than \nas set forth herein. This Settlement Agreement was drafted by counsel for the \nParties hereto, and there shall be no presumption or construction against any party. \nXVI. FAIRNESS HEARING AND FINAL ORDER OF APPROVAL \n69.  Before this Settlement Agreement becomes final and binding on the \nParties, the Court shall hold a Fairness Hearing to determine whether to enter the \nFinal Order of Approval and Settlement.

Clark, Stacey Lee, \nDennis Burns, Gerald K. Cooper and Daniel Cruz (collectively โDefendantsโ), by \nand through their respective counsel, hereby submit the following Settlement \nAgreement (โSettlement Agreementโ).

RECITALS \nPlaintiffs are former inmates at the Century Regional Detention Facility \n(โCRDFโ), a jail facility operated by the Los Angeles County Sheriffโs Department \n(โLASDโ), which houses female convicted inmates and pretrial detainees.  \nPlaintiffs filed this action in the United States District Court for the Central \nDistrict of California (โCourtโ) on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly \nsituated inmates on March 5, 2010.  \nPlaintiffs alleged various violations of the Federal and State Constitutions, of \n42 U.S.C. ยง1983, and California Civil Code ยง52.1 associated with the LASDโs \nstrip/visual body cavity search practices at CRDF during the class period.  \nThe  District  Court,  after  multiple  hearings  and  several  class  certification \norders that went through a number of iterations, certified the class on November 18, \n2016. See, Doc No. 327 (Order Granting Renewed Motion For Class Certification). \nThe certification was for liability only under Fed.R.Civ.P Rule (c)(4). \n On June 6, 2017, the District Court granted summary judgment on liability \nissues to the Plaintiff class on their claim for Monell liability under the Fourth \nAmendment,  and  dismissed  claims  against  the  individual  Defendants,  finding \nqualified  immunity  applied.  .  See,  Doc  No.  361.  The  District  Courtโs  liability \nsummary judgment ruling found it unnecessary to address changed conditions at \n \nCRDF because the searches violated the Fourth Amendment for the whole Class \nDamages  Period.  The  changes  in  conditions  are  nonetheless  factored  into  this \nSettlement. \nSubsequently, the Parties entered into a protracted armโs length mediation \nprocess with the assistance of Retired United States District Judge George King, \nincluding  three  in-person  mediation  sessions  with  Judge  King  and  numerous \ntelephonic sessions (both the Parties separately with Judge King and among the \nParties and Judge King).  \nThe Parties have reached a proposed Settlement subject to the approval of the \nCourt.  It  is  understood  and  agreed  that  this  Settlement  is  the  compromise  of \n2 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 4 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14150\n  disputed claims by the Named Plaintiffs and Class Members, and that the payments \nmade are not to be construed as an admission of liability by any of the Defendants. \nThe Defendants deny liability, preserve all defenses they have asserted or could \npresent in these proceedings or any future appeal, and intend merely to avoid the \nexpense of further litigation.  \nIn summary, this Settlement provides for dismissal of this case with prejudice \nin exchange for a non-reversionary Class Fund of $53 Million, from which costs of \nadministration, litigation costs and attorneyโs fees will be paid, and the remainder \nof which would be distributed to Class Members who make viable claims subject to \ncertain requirements for a minimum number of claims made (or a portion of funds \nwould go to cy pres distributions as defined herein).  \nAs a form of indirect compensation to absent Class Members, up to $3 \nmillion of the Class Fund will be used to fund contracts between the County of Los \nAngeles, on the one hand, the Moss Group and the Center for Gender and Justice \n(โCGJโ), on the other hand (the โMoss/CGJ Contractsโ). Both organizations have \nsignificant experience in assisting local, state, and national correctional agencies in \nthe development of gender-responsive and trauma-informed practices, \nprogramming, and services. The purpose of the contracts shall be to help develop a \nstrengthened model of gender-responsive policy and operational practice at all \n \nLASD facilities that house female inmates (including CRDF and Twin Towers), \nwhile enhancing the culture of safety and respect for both staff and the inmate \npopulation. The contracts will include preliminary assessment/evaluation, and may \nalso include the provision of expertise, leadership, technical assistance, and services \nin the following areas: system analysis/operations, policy review and development, \nstrategic planning, program development/inmate services, training/culture, and \nongoing assessment. The Moss/CGJ contracts shall be secured in furtherance of the \nLos Angeles County Board of Supervisorsโ effort to facilitate the design and \nimplementation of gender-responsive systems within the Los Angeles County \ncriminal justice system, as reflected in the Board of Supervisorsโ February 2019 \n3 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 5 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14151\n  motion titled โBuilding a Gender-Responsive Criminal Justice System.โ  \nII.  DEFINITIONS  \nThe listed terms used throughout this Settlement Agreement are intended to \nhave the following meanings: \n1.  โAdministratorโ means the Class Administrator, as agreed upon (or to be \nagreed upon) by the Parties and appointed by the Court to review and \ndetermine the validity and amount of claims submitted by a Settlement \nClass Member (โSCMโ) (as defined herein), according to the procedures set \nforth herein. \n2.  The โBar Dateโ is the date by which any Class Member who wishes to \nreceive payment pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and therefore is a \nSettlement Class Member (โSCMโ) as defined below must file his/her Proof \nof Claim and Release Form, file objections to this Settlement Agreement, or \nrequest to be excluded from the class (opt-out). The Bar Date shall be \ncalculated as the close of business on the 150th day after the last day of \nmailing of the Class Notice (or, for those whose initial notice is by email \nand text message, the day that they were to be sent such electronic notice in \nlieu of regular mail, as provided in Section X), which is up to occur within \ntwo consecutive business days from beginning to end, as is addressed in ยถ \n \n39, i.e., the Administrator must mail all notices within a two day period). \n3.  โClass Counselโ herein refers to Barrett S. Litt and Lindsay Battles of \nKAYE, McLANE, BEDNARSKI & LITT. \n4.  โClass Counsel Attorneyโs Feesโ refers to the amount awarded by the Court \nas Class Counselโs attorneyโs fees in this case, to be approved by the Court \nupon motion by Class Counsel. \n5.   โClass Counsel Litigation Costsโ refers to the amount of costs awarded by \nthe Court upon motion by Class Counsel.   \n6.  The โClass Fundโ refers to the amount of $53 Million as damages \ncompensation to the Class, to be paid by Defendants to the Administrator, \n4 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 6 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14152\n  and out of which the costs of Administration, Plaintiffsโ counsel \nexpert/consulting, litigation and mediation fees, incentive awards and \ncompensation to Class Members will be paid.  \n7.  The โClass Damages Periodโ refers to the period between March 5, 2008 \n(two years before the filing of the complaint) and January 1, 2015 (the date \nscanners or privacy partitions were available for all CRDF strip searches). \n8.  A โClass Memberโ means any member of the certified Damages Classes. \nAlthough the Court certified two damages classes, one from March 2008 \nthrough June 30, 2011, and one from July 1, 2011 through January 1, 2015 \n(because scanners were then being used for all strip searches unless the \ninmate requested a strip search in its place), for purposes of this settlement \nand because summary judgment was granted to both classes, the Damages \nClass is defined for settlement purposes as โany female inmate at CRDF \ninmate who, upon their admission or return to CRDF, were visual body \ncavity searched in groups, without individual privacy between March 5 \n2008 (two years before the filing of the complaint) and January 1, 2015.โ \n9.  The โClass Noticeโ means the notice to be sent to Class Members regarding \nthis Settlement, in a form substantially similar to that attached hereto as \nExhibit B, or as otherwise approved by the Court, and such other summary \n \nnotice to be published in accordance with the terms of this Settlement \nAgreement. \n10.  The โClass Member Listโ is a list of Class Members.  It is based solely on \nthe records of the LASD. Only persons appearing on that list qualify as \nClass Members. \n11.  The โDatabaseโ is the information provided in electronic form to the \nAdministrator which information has been compiled from the electronic \nrecords of the LASD, as filtered to identify those meeting the class \ndefinition by the Partiesโ experts. \n5 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 7 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14153\n  12.  The โDefendantsโ are the County of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Sheriffโs \nDepartment, its prior Sheriff Leroy Baca, Sammy Jones, Timothy Cornell, \nJohn H. Clark, Stacey Lee, Dennis Burns, Gerald K. Cooper and Daniel \nCruz. \n13.  The โEffective Dateโ is the date on which the District Court issues an Order \ngranting final approval of the Settlement Agreement, except that if any \nobjections to the settlement were submitted to the Court, the Effective Date \nis the date of the final resolution of any appeal of the Final Approval of this \nSettlement Agreement, or if no such appeal is filed, the expiration of the \ndeadline for filing a Notice of Appeal.   \n14.  The โFairness Hearingโ is the hearing on the fairness of this Settlement, \nwhich date will be set by the Court. \n15.  The  โFinal  Order  of  Approval  and  Settlementโ  is  the  Order  finally \napproving the settlement, entered by the Court (which may also be referred \nto herein as โFinal Orderโ). \n16.  The โLawsuitโ refers to the action styled Amador et al. v. Baca et al., Case \nNo. CV 10-01649 SVW (JEMx).. \n17.  The โMotion for Attorneyโs Fees and Costsโ is Class Counsel's application \nfor Attorneys' Fees and Costs. \n \n18.  The โNamed Plaintiffsโ or โClass Representativesโ refers to the plaintiffs \nnamed  in  the  Fourth  Amended  Complaint  to  this  suit,  who  are  Mary \nAmador, Lora Barranca, Alisa Battiste, Nancy Briseรฑo, Felice Cholewiak \n(Vargas),  Evangelina  Madrid,  Diana  Paiz,  Diane  Vigil  and  Myeshia \nWilliams. While Lora Barranca, Diana Paiz and Diane Vigil were named \nsolely  as  injunctive  relief  plaintiffs  under  ยง1983,  they  were  damages \nplaintiffs  under  state  law  and  Class  Members.  For  purposes  of  this \nSettlement, no distinction is made between or among the Named Plaintiffs. \n19.  โPreliminary Approvalโ is the Court's determination that the Settlement is \nwithin the range of possible approval and therefore that Class Notice should \n6 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 8 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14154\n  be sent to Class Members and a Fairness Hearing should be set by the \nCourt. \n20.  The  โPreliminary  Approval  Orderโ  is  an  order  entered  by  the  Court \npreliminarily  approving  the  Settlement,  after  which  Class  Notice,  the \nopportunity to object and Opt Out, and entry of a Final Order of Approval \nand Settlement would occur. \n21.  An โOpt-Outโ is any Class Member who files a timely request for \nexclusion, pursuant to the terms of this Settlement Agreement, to be \nexcluded from the Settlement Class. (If used as a verb, it refers to the \nprocess of filing such exclusion.)  \n22.  The โProof of Claim Formโ means the Proof of Claim and Release Form \nrequired to be used in order to make a claim for payment under this \nSettlement. A copy of the proposed Proof of Claim Form is attached as \nExhibit C. The pre-prepared Claim forms shall be bar coded to link with the \nClass Memberโs Database information and shall contain the damages to \nwhich the Class Member is entitled if s/he were to receive the full damages \nprovided for in this agreement. \n23.  โReleased Personโ means the Defendants and their affiliates, subsidiaries, \npredecessors, successors, and/or assigns, together with all past, present and \n \nfuture officials, employees, representatives, attorneys, outside counsel, \nand/or agents of Los Angeles County. โReleased Personโ also includes any \nand all insurance carriers, and/or their representatives and attorneys, for the \nReleased Persons. \n24.  โRemainderโ refers to the amount in the Class Fund after payment of Class \nCounselโs Attorney Fees, Class Counselโs Litigation Costs, and  mediation \ncosts, and the Moss/CGJ Contracts. The โMinimum Remainderโ is a figure \nused for purposes of determining whether cy pres payments are made and is \nbased on the estimate of the maximum fees to be sought (1/3 of the $53 \nMillion Fund), and estimated litigation and class administration costs ($1.5 \n7 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 9 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14155\n  Million),  and  the  Moss/CGJ  Contracts  (maximum  $3  Million);  thus  the \nMinimum Remainder is estimated to amount to $330,883,000, which the \nParties agree to round up to $341,000,000.  \n25.  The โSettlementโ refers to this agreement. \n26.  A โSettlement Class Memberโ (โSCMโ) means any Class Member as \ndefined above (whether or not she files a Timely Claim form), including \nrepresentatives, successors and assigns, who does not file a valid and timely \nRequest for Exclusion as provided for in this Settlement Agreement.  \n27.  The โSettlement Fundโ is the fund established by the Administrator with \nfunds transferred from Defendants from which the damages to the Class \nRepresentatives and Class Members will be paid.  The Defendants will pay \nall moneys they are obligated to pay under the Preliminary Approval Order, \nand the settlement approved by the Court, if any, into the Settlement Fund.    \n28.  โStrip Searchโ means a search conducted by LASD personnel on a Class \nMember (as defined above) in which the person was required to remove her \nclothing, including underwear, in the presence of a corrections officer \nand/or expose her breasts, genitals or body cavities for a visual inspection. \nAll persons appearing on the Class Member List were subjected to a strip \nsearch as defined herein.  \n \n29.  A โTimely Claimโ is one filed a) within the 150-day window provided by \nthe notice to be sent to the class, and b) to the extent the Court approves, \nlate claims (i.e., claims filed after the Class Notice period) that are filed \nprior to the Final Approval Hearing. \nIII.  DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY \n1.  The Parties acknowledge and agree that all undertakings and \nagreements contained in this Settlement Agreement have been agreed to solely for \nthe purpose of finally compromising all questions, disputes and issues between \nthem relating to the litigation.

Neither this \nSettlement Agreement nor any provision contained therein, nor any documents \nrelated hereto, nor any negotiations, statements or testimony taken in connection \nherewith may be offered or received as evidence, or used for any other purpose, or \nin any suit, action or legal proceeding which either of them have or in the future \nmay have with any other person, as an admission or concession of liability or \nwrongdoing on the part of either party, except in connection with any action or \nlegal proceeding to enforce this Settlement Agreement. The Parties have reached \nthis Settlement through arms-length negotiations and to avoid the costs and delays \nof further disputes, litigation and negotiations among them and after extensive \nnegotiations with an independent mediator, subject to approval by the Court. This \nSettlement Agreement has been entered into without any concession of liability or \nnon-liability whatsoever and has no precedential or evidentiary value whatsoever. \nIV.  FINANCIAL TERMS OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND CLASS \nDAMAGES ALLOCATION FORMULA \n2.  The Class Fund is the amount of $53,000,000. The class administration \ncosts shall be paid out of that fund, as will any incentive awards to the Class \n \nRepresentatives as approved by the Court. (Class Counselโs Litigation Costs will be \naddressed in Class Counselโs Motion for Attorneyโs Fees and Costs.) The \nRemainder of the Class Fund shall be distributed to the Class Members (including \nNamed Plaintiffs/Class Representatives) under the formula terms provided in this \nAgreement.   \n3.  Subject to approval of the Court at the hearing regarding the Final \nOrder of Approval and Settlement, the following incentive awards shall be paid to \nthe Named Plaintiffs (in addition to the share of the Class Fund to which they are \nentitled as Class Members). Class Counsel represent that they have no prior \nagreement with any Named Plaintiff to seek such awards, nor do they have any \n9 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 11 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14157\n  commitment to propose them. They are proposed at the initiative of Class Counsel \nand are intended to reflect Named Plaintiffsโ commitment to, and active assistance \nin advancing, this Lawsuit since it was filed in 2010: \nNAME  INCENTIVE AWARD \nMary Amador  $10,000 \nLora Barranca  $10,000 \nAlisa Battiste  $10,000 \nNancy Briseรฑo  $10,000 \nFelice (Cholewiak) Vargas  $10,000 \nEvangelina Madrid  $10,000 \nDiana Paiz  $10,000 \nDiane Vigil  $10,000 \nMyeshia Williams  $10,000 \nTOTAL  $90,000 \n4.  It is not currently possible to determine the amount of the Remainder \nbefore the hearing regarding the Final Order of Approval and Settlement, where the \nfinal amount of Class Counselโs Attorneyโs Fees and Costs awards, and class \nadministration costs , and the Moss/CGJ Contracts will be determined.  \n5.  The formula for distribution of the Remainder has been developed by \n  Class Counsel and, if approved by the Court, will be summarized in the Class \nNotice to be sent to Class Members. The formula is designed to account for the fact \nthat the alleged severity of challenged conditions varied depending on the time \nperiod the Strip Search occurred (with the most intrusive conditions before July \n2011 and least intrusive conditions after February 2014 when the bus bay became \nenclosed and had heating), the number of Strip Searches an inmate experienced and \nthe weather conditions when the Strip Search occurred.  \n6.  To briefly summarize, Class Counselโs assessment of these variations \nin conditions, which are factored into the class damages allocation formula, are as \nfollows: \n10 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 12 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14158\n  TIME PERIOD  CONDITIONS \n2/26/2014 โ 1/31/2015   Conditions: \n \n(Core Conditions \n (1) female inmates required to participate in \nApplicable to All Class \ngroup Strip Searches in which the labia lift \nMembers Regardless of \nprocedure was used; \nTime Period) \n(2) female inmates required to publicly identify if \nthey were menstruating, remove feminine \n \nhygiene products in view of other inmates; \nand  \n \n(3) female inmates required to expose their naked \nbody โ including bare pubic region and bare \nbreasts โ in the presence of a group. \n (4) inmates searched in groups of 24 inmates (or \nmore, see below). \n4/1/2013 โ 2/25/2014  Conditions: \n๏ท  All above conditions \nplus \n๏ท  Group Strip Searches occurred in a converted  \nbus garage with a chain link fence roof with a \ntarp on it and no heaters. \n7/1/2011 โ 3/30/20131  Conditions: \n  ๏ท  All above conditions \n  plus \n๏ท  Inmates searched in groups larger than 24 \ninmates \n๏ท  Inmates required to put clothing directly on \nthe ground.\n3/5/2008 โ 6/30/2011  Conditions: \n๏ท  All above conditions \nplus \n๏ท  Deputies simultaneously searched both lines \nof female inmates so that inmates were \ndirectly viewing each other during the Strip \n \n1 This subclass was because LASD reduced its class sizes to a maximum of 25 and installed tables \non which clothes could be placed in April 2013. \n11 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 13 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14159\n  TIME PERIOD  CONDITIONS \nSearch. \n \n7.  Based on the above considerations, Class Counsel have devised a \ndistribution model in which Class Members are compensated based on the number \nof Strip Searches they endured, with searches weighted based on the time period in \nwhich they occurred (which, in turn, corresponds to the severity of conditions). \nEach Strip Search is assigned a point-value which will translate to a per-diem dollar \nvalue at the time of distribution.  Class Members receive the designated number of \npoints based on the number of Strip Searches in each category.  \n8.  The chart below shows the categories, conditions associated with each \ncategory, and points assigned to each category.  \nTime Period  Points Per Strip Search  \n3/8/2008 โ 6/30/2011  100 \n7/1/2011 โ 3/31/2013  90 \n4/1/2013 โ 2/25/2014  80 \n \n2/26/2014 โ 1/31/2015  70 \n  9.  The distribution model also provides an additional 10-points for any \nStrip Search conducted at a temperature of 70 degrees or less.  \n10.  The per-search points are assigned to each Class Member, up to their \n50th search. The โ50-search capโ applies to less than .04% of the Class. This cap is \nto ensure that outliers who have outsized claims do not distort the meaningfulness \nof the recovery to the remaining Class Members. (Such outliers would be entitled to \nopt out and pursue their own claims if they so choose.) \n11.  That Class Memberโs point total is the sum of all their assigned points. \nThe final distribution will be based on the total points for each Class Member who \nfiled claims, divided by individual points assigned to each claiming Class Member. \n12 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 14 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14160\n  (If, for example, there is a total of 1,000,000 points for the aggregated Timely \nClaims, and Class Member โXโ had a total of 200 points, Class Member โXโ would \nreceive .02% (or .0002) of the Remainder; if the Remainder is the Minimum \nRemainder of $31 Million, that Class Members would receive $6,200).  These \nfigures are purely hypothetical and should not be considered as reflective of any \nlikely award. Because it is anticipated that not all Class Members will make Timely \nClaims, and this is a non-reversionary fund (except as provided in Section VI, \nbelow, for cy pres payments in the event of a low claim rate, which the Parties do \nnot anticipate), a claiming Class Memberโs share of the Remainder will be \ndetermined based on that Class Memberโs share of the total points for Class \nMembers who made Timely Claims.  \n12.  No Class Member who filed a Timely Claim will receive less than \n$200 (the minimum will be at least $200 but may be adjusted upwards) subject to \nthe limit of the Class Funds available in the Remainder. The minimum provision is \ndesigned to ensure that all Class Members who submit Timely Claims receive some \nrecovery.  \n13.  None of the Class Fund shall revert to the County. Accordingly, as \nexplained above, the money per Class Member making a Timely Claim will \nincrease proportionately to the extent that fewer Class Members make a claim.  \n \n14.  Class Counsel intend to submit a separate Motion for Attorneyโs Fees \nand Costs to be heard at the hearing regarding a Final Order of Approval and \nSettlement, to be analyzed under the standards for an award of fees and costs to a \nprevailing plaintiff under the percentage of the fund doctrine. While the motion will \nseek a percentage of the Class Fund as a fee award, subsumed within that request \nwill be any statutory attorneyโs fee to which Class Counsel would be entitled under \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 or Cal. Civil Code ยง 52.1(h). The Class Notice will advise Class \nMembers of Motion for Attorneyโs Fees and Costs and their right to object to it.  \n15.  The LASD represents that to the best of its knowledge, it has provided \nall the electronic data in its possession, which it is legally authorized to produce, \n13 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 15 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14161\n  regarding Class Members necessary to both identify and contact Class Members. \nThe LASD shall provide to the Administrator, to the extent that such information \nhas not already been provided, any such additional information in its possession \nwhich it is legally authorized to produce. Such information shall include date of \nbirth, social security number (SSN), driverโs license/state ID number, and most \nrecent contact information (address, phone and any other available contact \ninformation). In addition, LASD shall provide to the Administrator and Class \nCounsel the data from the Automated Justice Information System (โAJISโ) \nReleased-to-Agency field indicating whether  a Class Member was released to the \ncustody of another law enforcement agency. This information may only be used to \nreach out to Class Members to ensure they receive the Class Notice and are aware \nof how to file a claim pursuant to this Agreement.  LASD will make a written \nrequest to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (โCDCRโ), \nwhich request will include a list of Class Members who were transferred to CDCR \nfrom LASD custody, and request that CDCR:  (1) advise the Administrator of \nwhere and how the Class Notice to those Class Members still in CDCR physical \ncustody should be sent; and (2) provide the Administrator with the most recent \ncontact information in CDCRโs records (including records in the Division of Adult \nParole Operations, where applicable) for each Class Members who is no longer in \n \nCDCR physical custody. When making the foregoing request to CDCR, LASD will \nprovide to CDCR any individualized identifying information in its possession that it \nis legally authorized to include that could assist CDCR in identifying Class \nMembers. \nIf CDCR provides a response, LASD will then advise Class Counsel of \nCDCRโs response, and if CDCR either fails to respond or refuses to provide \nassistance, Class Counsel may seek Court assistance in securing the cooperation of \nCDCR to effectuate service of the Class Notice and to obtain the most up to date \ncontact information for Class Members.  Neither the County nor the LASD will \nhave any further obligation with respect to efforts to obtain contact information for \n14 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 16 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14162\n  Class Members from CDCR beyond the efforts described above, except that it will \nengage in any reasonable follow-up requested by CDCR.  LASD will likewise have \nno further obligation to assist with securing cooperation regarding the provision of \nClass Notice to Class Members still in CDCR custody. \nNothing in this agreement precludes Plaintiffs from seeking a court order \nauthorizing the LASD to provide CII and FBI numbers directly to CDCR as part of \nefforts to identify Class Members and provide Class Notice to individuals who were \npreviously transferred to CDCR. Should Plaintiffs file such a motion, they will \nserve the Attorney General of the State of California and the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation with the motion in order to provide each with the opportunity to be \nheard. Plaintiffs will not seek access to such records for themselves or for the \nAdministrator.  \nV.  RELEASES AND OTHER SETTLEMENT TERMS \n16.  The Parties enter into this Agreement solely for the purposes of this \nSettlement and implementation of the Settlement. If the Settlement fails to be \napproved or otherwise fails consummation, then this Settlement Agreement is \nhereby withdrawn.   \n17.  An SCM who complies with the requirements set forth in this \nSettlement Agreement and files a Timely Claim form will be paid specified sums \n \ndetermined by the distribution process set forth above, which payment shall be in \nfull satisfaction of all claims of that SCM. \n18.  The Settlement Agreement, as of the Effective Date, resolves in full all \nclaims against the Released Persons by all of the SCMs, including the Named \nPlaintiffs, involving violations of law or constitutional rights, including, without \nlimitation, their equal protection rights under federal and California law, their rights \nunder 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and California Civil Code ยง 52.1, any other rights under \nany other federal, state or local law, regulation, duty, or obligation, or any other \nlegal theory, action or cause of action, which arise from the class-wide factual \nallegations alleged in the Fourth Amended Complaint, which is the operative \n15 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 17 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14163\n  pleading in this matter ( โCovered Claimsโ). \n19.  When the Settlement Agreement is final, as of the Effective Date, all \nSCMs, including the Named Plaintiffs, waive all rights to any and all claims \nrelating to damages or reimbursement of any kind for the Covered Claims. This \nwaiver and release shall include a full release and waiver of unknown rights \nregarding the Covered Claims that may exist as of the Effective Date.  \n20.  As of the Effective Date, the SCMs, including the Named Plaintiffs, \nhereby waive any and all rights to pursue, initiate, prosecute, or commence any \naction or proceeding before any court, administrative agency or other tribunal, or to \nfile any complaint regarding acts or omissions by the Released Persons with respect \nto the Covered Claims during the class period; and further, as it relates to this \nwaiver or Release, expressly waive the provisions of California Civil Code ยง 1542, \nwhich provides that โa general release does not extend to claims which the creditor \ndoes not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the \nrelease, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her \nsettlement with the debtor.โ \n21.  This Settlement Agreement, together with its exhibits, contains all the \nterms and conditions agreed upon by the Parties regarding the subject matter of the \ninstant proceeding, and no oral agreement entered into at any time nor any written \n \nagreement entered into prior to the execution of this Settlement Agreement shall be \ndeemed to exist, or to bind the Parties, or to vary the terms and conditions \ncontained herein, except as expressly provided herein. \n22.  Each SCM shall be deemed to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the \nCourt. \n23.  This Settlement Agreement is subject to and conditioned on entry by \nthe Court of a Final Order of Approval and Settlement and the issuance of the final \norder of dismissal by the Court, providing the specified relief as set forth below, \nwhich relief shall be pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Settlement \nAgreement and the Partiesโ performance of their continuing rights and obligations \n16 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 18 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14164\n  hereunder. The Final Order of Approval and Settlement shall be deemed final on \nthe Effective Date. Such Final Order of Approval and Settlement shall: \na.  Dismiss with prejudice all claims in the action as to the Released Persons \nincluding  all  claims  for  monetary  damages,  declaratory  relief  and \ninjunctive  relief,  each  side  to  bear  its  own  costs  and  fees  except  as \notherwise provided for in this Settlement Agreement; \nb.  Order that all SCMs are enjoined from asserting against any Released \nPerson any and all claims that any SCM had, has or may have in the \nfuture based on the Covered Claims; \nc.  Release each Released Person from the claims that any SCM has, had or \nmay have in the future against such Released Person arising out of the \nCovered Claims; \nd.  Determine that this Settlement Agreement is entered into in good faith, is \nreasonable, fair and adequate, and in the best interest of the Class; and \ne.  Reserve the Courtโs continuing and exclusive jurisdiction over the Parties \nto  this  Settlement  Agreement,  including  Defendants  and  SCMs,  to \nadminister, supervise, construe and enforce the Settlement Agreement in \naccordance with its terms for the mutual benefit of all Parties. \n24.  The Parties will take all necessary and appropriate steps to obtain \n \npreliminary and final approvals of the Settlement Agreement, and dismissal of the \naction with prejudice, all Parties bearing their own fees and costs unless otherwise \nset forth in this Settlement Agreement. If the Court gives final approval of this \nSettlement Agreement, and if there is an appeal from such decision, the Parties will \ndefend the Settlement Agreement. \nVI.  CY PRES DISTRIBUTION IN THE EVENT OF A LOW CLAIM RATE \n25.  In order to ensure that Class Members do not receive a windfall \nbecause there are relatively few claims filed, the Parties agree that, if the total \nclaims do not amount to the Minimum Remainder based on the following formula, \nthe difference between those aggregated claims and Minimum Remainder will go to \n17 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 19 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14165\n  the organizations identified in ยถ 30. The formula to determine whether such cy pres \npayments are to be made (referred to as the โCy Pres Formulaโ shall be as follows: \nCY PRES FORMULA \n# SEARCHES  AMOUNT \n1-3  $5,000 \n4-6  $10,000 \n7-10  $15,000 \n11+  $20,000 \n \n26.   Thus, by way of example only, if the Minimum Remainder is $31 \nMillion, 4000 Class Members filed claims (which the Parties agree is likely a low \nclaim rate), and the average of their claims based on the Cy Pres Formula amounted \nto $9000 per claimant, the total would be $36,000,000, and no cy pres distribution \nwould apply. In contrast, if 3000 people filed claims based on the same average \n$9000 per claimant and same $31 Million Minimum Remainder, then $4,000,000 \n(the difference between the $31 Million Minimum Remainder and the $27,000,000 \nclaimed amount based on the Cy Pres Formula), would go to the Cy Pres Fund. \n27.  The foregoing formula only applies in the event that the total claims do \nnot amount to the Minimum Remainder based on the Cy Pres Formula. Otherwise, \nthe allocation formula set out in Section IV, above, applies. \n \n28.    The Cy Pres funds will not be returned to the Countyโs general fund \nbut will instead be provided to non-profit organizations or programs which provide \ngender-responsive services to female inmates in LASD custody.  At the time that it \nis determined that any Cy Pres funds are to be distributed, counsel for the Parties in \nthis case and the LA County Board of Supervisors will work in good faith to \nidentify the organizations or programs to receive those funds.  If they cannot agree, \nthe Parties will separately brief the Court, and the Court will determine the \norganizations and/or programs to which the Cy Pres funds will be paid. \nVII.  RESOLUTION AND PAYMENT OF CLAIMS \n29.  Defendants agree to the division of funds between Incentive Awards \n18 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 20 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14166\n  and the Remainder as proposed by Class Counsel subject to the approval of the \nCourt.  \nVIII. CLASS COUNSEL FEES \n30.  Class Counsel will file a Motion for Attorneyโs Fees and Costs on a \npercentage of the fund basis, and the payment of said fees and costs is subject to \nCourt approval. Class Counsel will not seek more than 1/3 of the $53 Million Class \nFund as the amount of attorneyโs fees requested; Class Counsel may seek less but \nmay not seek more. (This 1/3 cap is separate from Class Counselโs costs, i.e., Class \nCounsel may request up to 1/3 of the Class Fund plus costs.) \nIX.  CLASS ADMINISTRATOR \n31.  Counsel for the Parties will jointly agree on the selection of the Class \nAdministrator and, if they cannot so agree, will submit their suggestions to the \nCourt and the Court will determine the Administrator.  The Parties understand the \nimportance of a rapid process for choosing the Class Administrator and are \ncommitted to reaching a joint selection as soon as practicable. \n32.  The Administrator shall be responsible for taking any steps deemed \nappropriate and necessary by Class Counsel to notify the Class Members of their \nrights to file claims, and to assist them in doing so. Class Notice shall be issued \nelectronically by email and text message (for all Class Members whose email \n \naddresses and mobile phone numbers can be and have been obtained) by the date \nset in the Preliminary Approval Order for the initial mailing of Class Notice. On \nthat same date, Class Notice shall be provided by regular mail for all Class \nMembers for whom an email address and mobile phone number have not been \nobtained, for all incarcerated Class Members.  \n33.  For those Class Members whose initial Class Notice was sent by the \ncombination of email and text message who have not responded by filing either a \nclaim or an Opt Out within 30 days, they will be sent by regular mail the Class \nNotice previously provided to the other Class Members whose Class Notice was \nsent by regular mail, along with a statement that they were sent by email and text \n19 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 21 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14167\n  message a Class Notice as well, and this is being sent to ensure that they have seen \nthe Class Notice. (See, ยถ 40 for elaboration.) \n34.  The Administratorโs duty shall include the use of normal and \ncustomary means to search for a Class Memberโs email addresses, mobile phone \nnumbers and last known mailing addresses, including the use of a postal database \nand other specialized databases, when mail is returned. As indicated above, the \nAdministrator shall initially send electronic copies of the Class Notice to any \ninmates for whom email addresses and mobile telephone numbers are ascertainable \nand at the same time send a hardcopy version and claim form to any Class Member \nwhose email and mobile phone numbers are not ascertainable, as well as any Class \nMembers who are currently incarcerated in California State prisons. (The \nAdministrator is responsible for making reasonable efforts to determine Class \nMembers who are now incarcerated in California state prisons). The Administrator \nwill also propose economically viable and likely productive forms of notice through \nthe use of social media and online advertising.  \n35.  Beginning when it is first retained after the Court approves its \nappointment, the Administrator will begin to obtain as many Class Member email \naddresses and mobile phone numbers as reasonably possible. Before the filing of \nthe Motion for Preliminary Approval, the Administrator will advise the Parties and \n \nthe Court of when the Administrator believes it can reasonably obtain available \nClass Member email addresses, phone numbers and mailing addresses, and the date \nfor mailing the Class Notice shall be set with that time in mind.  \n36.  Notice shall proceed as follows: \n1) Initial Class Notice shall commence with email and text notices \nfor all Class Members whose email addresses and/or mobile \nphone numbers are ascertainable (assuming both are \nascertainable, Class Members will receive two forms of \nelectronic notice; if either the email address or mobile phone \nnumber cannot be obtained, the notice will be sent via the \n20 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 22 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14168\n  available means).  \n2) On the same day, notice by regular mail shall be sent to all Class \nMembers for whom either an email address or mobile phone \nnumber or both could not be ascertained. This means that all \nClass Members will receive the Class Notice by either (1) email \nand text; or (2) regular mail plus either email or text (assuming \none of the two is available); or (3) regular mail only (for those \nwhose email and mobile phone numbers cannot be located).   \n3) Thirty days after the initial issuance of Class Notice, the \nAdministrator will send notice by regular mail to all Class \nMembers who were initially notified only by electronic means \nonly (those who received notice by email and text) and who have \nnot yet submitted claim forms along with the explanation that \nthey were sent such electronic notice but this notice is being sent \nas well because they did not file a claim or exclude themselves \nfrom the settlement.  \n4) Throughout the notice period, the Administrator shall continue \nto send email and text notice if and when it learns additional \nemail addresses/phone numbers for Class Members.  \n \n5) Where Class Notice is sent by email or text, the Class \nAdministrator will periodically remind Class Members through \nemail/text blasts to file claims. (If possible, procedures shall be \nimplemented to remove Class Members from email/text blasts \nwho have submitted claims). \n37.  The Administrator shall complete the initial Class Notice within two \nconsecutive business days. The second day of such mailing is the first day of the \nperiod for calculating the โBar Dateโ (defined previously). That mailing shall occur \nas soon as practicable after the settlement has been Preliminarily Approved and no \nlater than the date set by the Court.  \n21 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 23 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14169\n  38.  The Class Notice shall describe the particulars of the case, provide the \nclass definition, provide information for claimants to contact the Administrator for \na claim form, notify Class Members of establishment of a case website, and contain \nother usual and customary information. The proposed Class Notice is attached to \nthis Settlement Agreement as Exhibit B. \n39.  The Administrator will include in its bid a line item for the cost of \nobtaining from CDCR the identities of Class Members in CDCR custody to whom \nClass Notice should be sent at their CDCR housing location.  \n40.  The Parties discussed and presently do not intend to publish Class \nNotice in local newspapers because experience has shown that such notice is of \nlittle value in notifying Class Members. Instead, mail, email and text notice will be \nsupplemented through summary publication in Prison Legal News (a publication \nwidely distributed to inmates throughout the country); and through selective social \nmedia/online outreach directly targeting Class Membersโ Facebook and/or \nInstagram accounts.  \n41.  If specifically requested by Plaintiffsโ counsel, the Defendants will \nseek to obtain the cooperation of CDCR (subject to the limitations set forth in \nParagraph 15), and the Los Angeles County Probation Department to assist in \nlocating Class Members, including, where Defendants believe legally permissible, \n \nproviding more recent contact information for Class Members. The LASD will \nadvise on its website of the existence of this Settlement and place a link on the \nwebsite to connect viewers to the Administratorโs website. The LASD will also \npost physical copies of the Class Notice (Exhibit โBโ) in CRDF Reception and Day \nRooms. \n42.  The request for bid to potential Administrators included requests for \nall such potential activities as well as suggestions for other ways of reaching \npotential Class Members. That request for bid also requested economically viable \nproposals for means by which Class Members can receive payment through \nelectronic means rather than by check. There will also be requests to nonprofits that \n22 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 24 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14170\n  address criminal justice reform, reentry or programs for former inmates to provide \nnotice on their websites and to their mailing lists.  \nX.  CLASS ADMINISTRATION FOR PROOF OF CLAIM FORMS AND \nPAYMENT SCHEDULE \n43.  The Administrator shall be responsible for providing and receiving \nProof of Claim Forms in paper and electronic format. The Administrator shall \ndetermine Class Membership and the amount of monies due each timely claiming \nClass Member based on the formula contained in Section IV.  \n44.  A Proof of Claim Form shall be deemed timely submitted under \nsubsection (a) of Definition # 29 (Timely Claim) when received by the \nAdministrator, or postmarked, on or before the Bar Date. Facsimile or electronic \nmail filings are acceptable and timely so long as they clearly indicate the case on \nwhich the claim is filed and are received on or before the Bar Date.  \n45.  If a Class Member submits a Claim Form that is deficient in some \nrespect, the Administrator shall provide written notice by First Class Mail and a 30-\nday time limit to provide a proper Claim Form, which notice shall inform the Class \nMember of what she must do in order to submit a proper claim. Failure to cure the \ndeficiency within the 30-day time limit will bar any further rights for consideration \nof eligibility to make a valid claim. So long as the original claim is received on or \n \nbefore the Bar Date, it shall be considered timely under sub-section (a) of \nDefinition # 30 (Timely Claim) if any deficiency is cured within 30 days of the \nmailing of a notice of deficiency. \n46.  Claim Forms received after the Bar Date shall be rejected. The \nAdministrator will notify claimants of the rejection of untimely Claims. \n47.  The $53 Million payment shall be made in three equal installments, the \nfirst of which shall be made 30 days after the Effective Date, the second of which \nshall be made twelve months after the first payment, and the third of which shall be \nmade twelve months after the second payment. \n48.  The costs of Class Administration through the Final Order of Approval \n23 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 25 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14171\n  and Settlement and the first round of distribution of checks will be taken from the \nfirst payment; 1/3 of the costs of the Moss/CGJ Contracts shall be taken (or held for \nthat purpose by the Administrator) from each payment. \n49.  For each payment, 1/3 of the total Attorneyโs Fees and Costs awarded \nby the Court to Class Counsel shall be paid into the KMBL Client Trust Account \nand the remaining funds shall be paid to the Class Administrator for distribution \nunder the terms of this Agreement. \n50.  The Class Administrator shall take its accrued and reasonably \nprojected costs of administration for that round from the second and third round of \npayments. \n51.  In addition to the first round of payment to qualifying Class Members, \nthe Administrator will advise them of the estimated time of payments to be made in \nthe second and third rounds and advise Class Members to keep them apprised of \nany address changes. \n52.  The Administrator shall make the first round of payments to SCMs \nwho have filed Timely Claims as ultimately determined by the Court in accordance \nwith this Settlement Agreement within a reasonable time not to exceed 90 days \nafter the Effective Date.  \n53.  If a check to an SCM is not cashed within three months of its mailing, \n \nthe Administrator shall hold the funds for nine additional months, during which \ntime it shall make reasonable efforts to contact the person to whom the uncashed \ncheck was written to make arrangements for its cashing or reissuance. The \nAdministrator shall not make any payment to any SCM until all claims have been \nsubmitted to the Administrator pursuant to the terms of this Settlement Agreement.  \n54.  Any SCM funds not cashed within one year of a checkโs initial mailing \nshall be voided, and those funds (โUncashed Fundsโ) shall held for the next round \nof payments. Where an SCMโs check was not cashed within that one year period, \nthat SCM shall be eliminated as a qualifying Class Member, and that SCMโs past \nand future funds shall become part of the fund for future distribution to Class \n24 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 26 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14172\n  Members, and allocated to the remaining SCMโs during the next round of payments \naccording to the Class Damages Allocation Formula contained in Section IV.  \n55.  Uncashed funds remaining in the Class Fund one year after the third \nround of payments shall be given as a donation to the Cy Pres Fund (see ยถ 30), to \nbe allocated equally among the qualifying organizations/ programs. \nXI.    EXCLUSION FROM SETTLEMENT CLASSโOPT OUTS  \n56.  Any Class Member who wishes to be excluded from this Settlement \nmust submit a request to be excluded from the class, a process defined herein as \nโOpt-Out.โ The request for exclusion must be delivered to the Administrator, or \npostmarked, on or before the Bar Date or as the Court may otherwise direct.  \n57.  Although Named Plaintiffs are entitled to Opt-Out of the Settlement, \nPlaintiffsโ counsel has conferred with each of them, and they all approve of and \nsupport the settlement, and have advised that they do not intend to Opt-Out. \n58.  Each Class Member who chooses to Opt-Out from or object to this \nSettlement shall be deemed to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court with \nrespect to his/her claim. \n59.  Any Class Member who does not Opt-Out as set forth in this \nSettlement Agreement, shall be deemed conclusively to have become an SCM and \nto be bound by the Settlement Agreement and all subsequent proceedings, orders \n \nand judgments herein, regardless of whether s/he files a claim form.  \n60.  Any Class Member who exercises an Opt-Out shall not share in any \nmonetary benefits provided by this Settlement Agreement. \n61.  The Administrator will periodically report to Defendantsโ counsel and \nClass Counsel regarding all Opt-Outs received and will determine and report to \ncounsel the total number of Opt-Outs no later than 10 days after the Bar Date.  \n62.  If the total number of Opt-Outs exceeds 250 individuals, Defendants, \nin their sole discretion, may rescind this Settlement Agreement. In exercising this \nright of rescission, Defendants shall provide the Administrator and Class Counsel \nwith written notice of rescission within 20 days after receipt of the Administratorโs \n25 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 27 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14173\n  report providing the total number of Opt-Outs. In the event Defendants exercise the \nright of rescission in accordance with this paragraph, any funds paid or deposited \npursuant to this Settlement Agreement shall be returned to Defendants within 10 \ndays of the rescission, less any expenses, fees and costs incurred by the \nAdministrator.  Rescission shall return the Case to active litigation status. \nXII.  APPROVALS REQUIRED \n63.  The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has approved the terms \nof this Settlement although, after Final Approval, it will have to finally approve the \nFinal Order of Approval and Settlement. \nXIII. DISPUTE RESOLUTION \n64.  In the event of any disputes regarding implementation of the \nSettlement Agreement as set forth herein, they shall be resolved by the Court.  \nXIV.   THE MOSS/CGJ CONTRACTS \n65.  Plaintiffs and Class Counsel agree that the Moss/CGJ Contracts constitute \nSubsequent Remedial Measures in response to the events underlying this litigation \npursuant to Rule 407 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (and similar statue statutes \nlike California Evidence Code ยง 1151). Plaintiffs and Class Counsel also agree that \nany reports generated by the Moss Group or CGJ pursuant to contracts entered into \nunder the terms of this Settlement Agreement are statements of those entities and do \n \nnot constitute party statements of Los Angeles County or the LASD within the \nmeaning of Rule 801 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (and similar statue statutes \nlike California Evidence Code ยง 1220).  \n66.  The initial reports prepared by the Moss Group or CGJ paid for by \nfunds provided under this Settlement Agreement will be provided to the Board of \nSupervisors and to Class Counsel. Class Counsel will also receive copies of the \nnon-privileged portions of follow up reports back to the Board about the Moss \nGroup/CGJ Reports or Contracts by any County agencies. All such reports provided \nto Class Counsel shall be confidential and will not be publicized or disclosed to any \nother party, except to the extent they have been made public by the Board.  \n26 \nAMADOR CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 395-2   Filed 10/31/19   Page 28 of 30   Page ID\n \n #:14174\n  67.  Any reports prepared by the Moss Group or CGJ are their analyses and \nrecommendations. Nothing in this Agreement requires that they be accepted or \nimplemented by Defendants, who reserve the right to decline to implement any \nrecommendation made in the Moss/CGJ Contracts for any reasons. \nXV.XIV.  INTEGRATION \n68.65. This Settlement Agreement supersedes all prior communications \nregarding the matters contained herein between the Parties or their representatives. \nThis Settlement Agreement is an integrated agreement and contains the entire \nagreement regarding the matters herein between the Parties, and no representations, \nwarranties or promises have been made or relied on by any party hereto other than \nas set forth herein.

Counsel for\n7 the parties, who signed the Revised Settlement Agreement, represent that their\n8 respective clients have approved the settlement.\n9 The Named Plaintiffs/Class Representatives are Mary Amador, Lora\n10 Barranca, Diana Paiz, Diane Vigil, Alisa Battiste, Felice Cholewiak, Evangeline\n11\nMadrid, Myeshia Williams, and Nancy Briseno. Plaintiffs are former (or current at\n12 the time of the filing of the complaint) inmates of the Los Angeles Sheriff's\n13 Department's( \"LASD\") women's jail known as Century Regional Detention\n14 Facility (hereafter \"CRDF\"). Plaintiffs contended that the LASD routinely\n15 subjected female inmates to highly invasive body cavity inspections, in large\n16\ngroups (often over 40 women), without individual privacy, and despite the absence\n17\nof a penological justification and the ready availability of alternatives, in violation\n18\nof the Fourth Amendment. The Court granted summary judgment on liability. See\n19\nDkt. 361. The Defendants are the County of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles County\n20\nSheriff's Department, former Los Angeles County Sheriff Leroy Baca, and various\n21\nindividual members of the LASD.\n22\nWhile Defendants continue to dispute the validity of Plaintiffs' allegations,\n23\nthe parties have agreed to enter into this Settlement Agreement to avoid the mutual\n24\nrisks of litigation.\n25\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED,A DJUDGED AND DECREED THAT:\n26\nI.

All\n2 terms defined therein shall have the same meaning in this Order.\n3 2.  The Settlement Agreement, as revised, is hereby preliminarily\n4 approved, subject to further consideration thereof at the Fairness Hearing provided\n5 for below. The Court finds that the non-reversionary class settlement fund of\n6 $53,000,000 and its proposed allocation, and the other provisions contained within\n7 the Settlement Agreement, are within the range of what would constitute a fair,\n8 reasonable, and adequate settlement in the best interests of the Class as a whole,\n9 and that the terms of the Settlement Agreement otherwise satisfy the Federal Rules\n10 of Civil Procedure 23(e) and due process requirements.\n11 II.

The Court has set the following dates for purposes of this class action:\n14 (a) Final class identifying information, to the extent not already provided,\n15 will be provided to Class Administrator JND Legal Administration no\n16\nlater than Monday, December 2, 2019;\n17 (b)F riday, December 6, 2019: Class member website shall be updated to\n18 reflect preliminary approval order and to permit class members to\n19\nsubmit claims online;\n20 (c) Monday, January 6, 2020 (or earlier): First round of class notice: first-\n21 class mail to all class members except those for whom the Claims\n22\nAdministrator has both an email address and mobile phone number\n23\n(in which case the class member will receive notice by mail and text);\n24\n(d)M onday, January 6, 2020 (or earlier): summary publication in Prison\n25\nLegal News (a publication widely distributed to inmates throughout\n26\nthe country) and begin selective social media online outreach directly\n27\ntargeting class members' Facebook and/or Instagram accounts;\n28\n(e) Monday, January 6, 2020 (or earlier): signage posted at CRDF and\n2\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 399   Filed 11/07/19   Page 4 of 12   Page ID\n #:14374\n1 Twin Towers advising inmates of settlement and how to make a\n2 claim; claim forms available to all detainees at these facilities;\n3 (~ Thursday, February 6, 2020: Notice by regular mail to all class\n4 members who were initially notified by electronic means only (those\n5 who received notice by email and text) and who have not yet\n6 submitted claim forms along with the explanation that they were sent\n7 such electronic notice but this notice is being sent as well because\n8 they did not file a claim or exclude themselves from the settlement;\n9 (g)T hursday, February 6, 2020: The Class Administrator will begin\n10 periodically reminding class members through email/text blasts to file\n11\nclaims;\n12\n(h)M onday, February 10, 2020: Filing of Plaintiffs' Motion for Award of\n13 Attorneys' Fees and Costs;\n14 (i) Thursday, June 4, 2020: Deadline to file Class Members' Objections\n15 to any aspect of the Settlement (including Plaintiffs' Motion for\n16\nAward of Attorneys' Fees and Costs): Must be postmarked or\n17 received by that date;\n18\n(j) Thursday, June 4, 2020: Deadline to opt-out: Must be postmarked or\n19\nreceived by that date;\n20\n(k)T hursday, June 4, 2020: Deadline to file class claims: Must be\n21\npostmarked or received by that date;\n22\n(1) Monday, July 6, 2020: Deadline to file Opposition or Reply to\n23\nObjections (including to objections to award of attorneys' fees and\n24\nCOStS~;\n25\n(m)M onday, July 6, 2020: Deadline to file proposed final approval order\n26\nand motion for final approval of settlement;\n27\n(n)M onday, July 20, 2020: Final Approval hearing.\n28\n4.  In the event that the class notice process does not by January 6, 2020,\n3\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 399   Filed 11/07/19   Page 5 of 12   Page ID\n #:14375\n1 as provided above, the subsequent dates contained herein will be deferred for the\n2 number of additional days before such notice occurs without the need for\n3 additional Court approval. However, the Court must approve any change of the\n4 date of the Final Approval Hearing.\n5 5.  If the number of Opt Outs amounts to 250 or more, Defendants shall\n6 have the option of withdrawing from the settlement.\n7 6.  The Parties have identified exclusively from Los Angeles County Jail\n8 records Damages Class Members based on who was housed at CRDF and the\n9 times and days they were strip/visual body cavity searched during the damages\n10 period. Only persons so identified are Damages Class members.\n11\n7.  The \"Class Damages Period\" refers to the period between March 5,\n12 2008 (two years before the filing of the complaint) and January 1, 2015 (the date\n13 scanners or privacy partitions were available for all CRDF strip searches).\n14 III.  SETTLEMENT TERMS.\n15\n8.  In summary, the settlement's basic terms, as they relate to Damages\n16\nClass Members, are that Defendants will provide payment of a total of Fifty-Three\n17\nMillion dollars ($53,000,000) equally spread over athree-year period into a Class\n18\nFund. From that amount, the following awards will be made, subject to court\n19\napproval:\n20\na. Incentive awards to the 9 Named Plaintiffs in the amount of $10,000 each\n21\n(for a total of $90,000).\n22\nb. Payment of the third-party class settlement administration costs to the\n23\nchosen class administrator, JND Legal Administration, estimated at a\n24\nmaximum of approximately $464,000 for a claims rate of up to 33%\n25\n(which, based on counsel's experience in Jail cases, is substantially\n26\nhigher than the expected claims rate.) However, depending on the\n27\nresponse rate to the notice, Plaintiffs' counsel may request that JND do\n28\ngreater outreach, which would increase the cost.\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 399   Filed 11/07/19   Page 6 of 12   Page ID\n #:14376\n1 c. Plaintiffs will file a motion for attorney's fees and costs to be approved\n2 by the court. The settlement agreement provides that Plaintiffs' counsel\n3 may request up to 1/3 of the class fund but not more, plus reimbursement\n4 of litigation costs. The final determination of the appropriate attorneys'\n5 fee will be made by the Court.\n6 d. The remainder of the Class Fund (estimated as a minimum of slightly\n7 under $34 Million) shall be distributed to the class members (including\n8 Named Plaintiffs/Class Representatives) under a formula contained in\n9 ยถยถ5-13 of the Settlement Agreement( Exhibit A to the proposed\n10 Preliminary Approval Order), particularly ยถ7.\n11 9.  The distribution formula awards a certain number of points for each\n12 strip/visual body cavity search. The number of points per search ranges between\n13 70 โ 100, based on the time period in which the search occurred. The points vary\n14 according to time period because the invasiveness of the search conditions varied\n15 over time, with the worst conditions occurring prior to July 2011. Each search\n16 conducted at a temperature of 70 degrees or less receives an additional 10-points.\n17 The per-search points are assigned to each class member, up to their 50th search.l\n18 This cap is to ensure that outliers who have outsized claims do not distort the\n19 meaningfulness of the recovery to the remaining class members.( Such outliers\n20 would be entitled to opt out and pursue their own claims if they so chose.)\n21 10.  Once the claims period closes, the claims administrator will calculate\n22 the total points for each class member and total points for all claiming class\n23 members who submitted timely claims. Each class member's recovery will be\n24 determined based on that class member's percentage of the total points for all class\n25 members.\n26 11.  Despite the foregoing, no class member who qualifies for payment\n27 will receive less than a total of $200.( This minimum payment amount would\n28\nI The \"50-search cap\" applies to less than .04% of the class.\n5\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 399   Filed 11/07/19   Page 7 of 12   Page ID\n #:14377\n1 apply only in the event of an unexpectedly high claims rate).\n2 12.  The Class Fund is non-reversionary. However, to ensure that there is\n3 not a windfall to claiming class members in the event of a very low claims rate,\n4 there will be a donation to cy pres organizations to be agreed on to the extent that\n5 the total value of claims is less than the agreed upon \"Minimum Remainder\" of\n6 $31 Million. The value of the claims for purposes of this provision is based on the\n7 following chart. The Court has reservations about this provision that will be\n8 addressed, if necessary, at the Final Approval Hearing and in the Final Approval\n9\nOrder.\n10\nCY PRES FORMULA\n11 # SEARCHES AMOUNT\n1-3 $5,000\n12\n4-6 $10,000\n13 7-10 $15,000\n1 l+ $20,000\n14\nIV.  CLASS ADMINISTRATOR\n15\n13.  The Court approves the retention of JND Legal Administration\n16\n(\"JND\") as Class Administrator, to administer the distribution of the Class and\n17\nSettlement Notice and publication of the Class and Settlement Notice, and to\n18\ndistribute the proceeds of the settlement to all eligible Class Members pursuant to\n19\nthe Plan set out in the Settlement Agreement( E~ibit A)s hould the Court grant\n20\nfinal approval. E~ibit E (the Class Administrator bid) includes the qualifications\n21\nof JND, which establishes to the Court's satisfaction the qualifications of JND to\n22\nact as the Class Administrator.\n23\n14.  The Class Administrator shall preserve all written communications\n24\nfrom Class Members in response to the Class and Settlement Notice at least until\n25\nDecember 31, 2023, or pursuant to further order of the Court. All written\n26\ncommunications received by the Class Administrator from Class Members relating\n27\nto the Settlement Agreement shall be available at all reasonable times for\n28\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 399   Filed 11/07/19   Page 8 of 12   Page ID\n #:14378\n1 inspection and copying by Counsel for the Parties, and copies shall be regularly\n2 provided to Counsel for the Parties.\n3 15.  The Class Administrator shall be compensated from the Class\n4 Damages Fund for its services in connection with notice and administration and\n5 for the costs of giving mailed and published notice, and the other services it\n6 performs, pursuant to such orders as the Court may enter from time to time.\n7 16.  Within two weeks after this Preliminary Approval Order is signed by\n8 the Court, the County of Los Angeles shall deposit or cause to be deposited into an\n9 account designated by the Class Administrator by check sent by overnight mail an\n10 amount of same day available funds equal to the amount requested by the Class\n11\nAdministrator to cover the costs of notice as provided herein, and will provide\n12 additional funds for its administrative work pursuant to the terms of its accepted\n13 bid, a copy of which is attached as E~ibit E. Prior to entry of the Final Order of\n14 Approval of Settlement, the Class Administrator will not accrue any costs not\n15 itemized in E~ibit E unless agreed to by the Plaintiffs' counsel and approved by\n16 the Court. If the Court does not enter the Final Order of Approval and Settlement,\n17 then all such funds paid to the Class Administrator, to the extent they are available\n18 after payment of all accrued class administration expenses, shall be returned to\n19\nDefendants.\n20 17.  If this settlement does not go through for any reason, a new settlement\n21\nis not reached, the case goes to trial, and Plaintiffs are not successful in their\n22\nprosecution of the case, Defendants shall not seek reimbursement from Plaintiffs\n23\nof class administration funds paid under this settlement.\n24\nV.  CLASS COUNSEL\n25\n18.  Barrett S. Litt and Lindsay Battles of Kaye, McLane, Bednarski &Litt\n26\nare hereby confirmed as counsel for the Class Representatives and the Class\n27\n(\"Class Counsel\")\n28\n19.

No notice by publication shall be required because such\n12 notice has not proven effective at reaching class members, and the resources are\n13 better spent on attempting to reach class members through electronic email and\n14 other means of electronic outreach. See revisions to F.R.Civ.P 23 (c)(2)(B)\n15 effective December 2019 (acknowledging that notice \"may be by ... electronic\n16 means, or other appropriate means\" in addition to or in lieu of United States\n17\nmail).\n18 21.  Defendants represent that they have already provided the name,\n19 address, social security number, date of birth, driver's license information, and any\n20\nother identifying information of Damages Class Members, to Plaintiffs' counsel,\n21\nwho will transmit it to the Class Administrator. Such information shall be\n22\nconfidential and may not be disclosed to anyone except counsel of record, the\n23\nClass Administrator, and designated representatives of Defendants. Should the\n24\nDefendants discover at any time any additional information containing relevant\n25\nclass information, they shall promptly provide it to Plaintiffs' counsel and the\n26\nClass Administrator.\n27\n22.  At least seven days before the Fairness Hearing, Class Counsel and/or\n28\nthe Class Administrator shall serve and file a sworn statement by the Class\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 399   Filed 11/07/19   Page 10 of 12   Page ID\n #:14380\n1 Administrator attesting to compliance with the provisions of this Order governing\n2 Class and Settlement Notice. This shall include a list of all people who have opted\n3 out of the class.\n4 23.  The Court approves the amended Class and Settlement Notice\n5 attached as Exhibit C.\n6 24.  The Court approves the Claim Form attached as Exhibit D.\n7 25.  The Court approves the Class Administrator Bid attached as E~ibit\n8\nE.\n9 26.  The Court finds that the notice required by the foregoing provisions of\n10 this Order is the best notice practicable under the circumstances and shall\n11\nconstitute due and sufficient notice of the Settlement and the Fairness Hearing to\n12\nall Class Members and other persons affected by and/or entitled to participate in\n13\nthe settlement, in full compliance with the notice requirements of Rule 23 Federal\n14\nRules of Civil Procedure and due process.\n15\nVII.  THE FAIRNESS HEARING( FINAL APPROVAL HEARING)\n16\n27.  A Fairness Hearing shall be held on July 20, 2020, to consider:( a) the\n17\nfairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of the Settlement;( b) whether a Final\n18\nOrder of Approval and Settlement should be entered in its current or some\n19\nmodified form; and (c) the application by Class Counsel for attorneys' fees and\n20\nexpenses (the \"Fee Motion\").\n21\n28.  At least two weeks prior to the Fairness Hearing, Plaintiffs shall\n22\nsubmit a proposed Final Approval Order, which shall be approved by Defendants.\n23\nThat proposed order will contain the final provisions the Parties seek the Court to\n24\nfinally approve and the Parties' proposed court orders related to any objections\n25\nthat have been filed. It will not be necessary to file a separate motion for final\n26\napproval.\n27\n29.  The date and time of the Fairness Hearing shall be set forth in the\n28\nClass and Settlement Notice but shall be subject to adjournment by the Court\n]G\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 399   Filed 11/07/19   Page 11 of 12   Page ID\n #:14381\n1 without further notice to the Class Members other than that which may be posted\n2 at the Court and on the Court's web site.\n3 30.  Any Class Member who objects to the approval of the Settlement\n4 Agreement, the Fee Motion, the Named Plaintiffs' incentive awards or the\n5 proposed allocation of damages among class members may appear at the Fairness\n6 Hearing and show cause why any one of the foregoing should not be approved as\n7 fair, reasonable, and adequate, and why the Final Order of Approval and\n8 Settlement should not be entered, except that no such Class Member may appear at\n9\nthe Fairness Hearing unless the Class Member, no later than June 4, 2020 [the date\n10 to file objections to the Settlement]( a) files with the Clerk of the Court a notice of\n11\nsuch person's intention to appear, a statement that indicates the basis and grounds\n12 for such person's objection to the Settlement Agreement, the Fee Petition, the\n13 Named Plaintiffs' incentive awards or the proposed allocation of damages among\n14 class members, and all documentation, papers, or briefs in support of such\n15 objection; and by the same date (b) serves upon all Counsel to the Parties (as listed\n16 in the Class Notice), either in person or by mail, copies of such notice of intention\n17 to appear, statement of objections and all documentation, papers, or briefs that\n18 such person files with the Court.

Final determination of whether any\n20\nsuch objector is a Class Member who has standing to object shall be determined\n21\nsolely from the Defendants' records, from which the list of Class Members has\n22\nbeen compiled. In the absence of the timely filing and timely service of the notice\n23\nof intention to appear and all other materials required by this paragraph, any\n24\nobjection shall be deemed untimely and denied.\n25\n31.  Pending final approval of the Settlement Agreement, no Class\n26\nMember shall, either directly, representatively, or in any other capacity,\n27\ncommence, prosecute against any Defendant or participate in any action or\n28\nproceeding in any court or tribunal asserting any of the matters, claims, or causes\n10\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 399   Filed 11/07/19   Page 12 of 12   Page ID\n #:14382\n1 of action that are to be released by the Settlement Agreement upon final approval.\n2 32.  In the event of final approval of the Settlement Agreement, all\n3 Damages Class Members (except those who have opted out) shall be forever\n4 enjoined and barred from asserting any of the matters, claims or causes of action\n5 released by the Settlement Agreement, and all such Class Members shall be\n6 deemed to have forever released any and all such matters, claims and causes of\n7 action as provided for in the Settlement Agreement.\n8 VIII.

INTRODUCTION \nOn January 28, 2011, Plaintiffs Mary Amador, Alisa Battiste, Felice Cholewiak, Evangelina \nMadrid, Lora Barranca, Diana Paiz, and Diane Vigil (โPlaintiffsโ) filed their Second Amended \nComplaint (โSACโ) against Defendants County of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County Sheriffโs \nDepartment (โLASDโ), Sherriff Leroy Baca, and seven LASD Deputies, alleging two violations of 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983โone for violations of the Fourth Amendment and the other for violations of the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendentโand various related state law claims, each arising out of \nstrip-search policies allegedly in place at LASDโs Century Regional Detention Facility (โCRDFโ) \nlocated in Lynwood, California.  (Dckt. 109).1  On December 27, 2011, after receiving briefing from the \nparties, the Court moved this action to its inactive calendar, pending the Supreme Courtโs decision in \nFlorence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington, 132 S.Ct. 1510 (2012).  At that \ntime, there were two motions pending before this Court: Plaintiffsโ motion for class certification (Dckt. \n59) and Defendantsโ motion to dismiss the SAC (Dckt. 121).  \n                                                 \n1 Defendants opposed Plaintiffโs motion to amend; after holding a hearing on the matter, the \nCourt granted the motion. (Dckt. 113).

Leroy D. Baca, et al. \n \nThe Supreme Court handed down its decision in Florence, providing considerable guidance to \nthe instant case.  The Court therefore finds that this matter is ready to proceed, and hereby MOVES this \naction to its active calendar.   \nMoreover, for the reasons explained in this Order, the Court DENIES Defendantsโ motion to \ndismiss as to Plaintiffโs Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment causes of action and BIFURCATES the \nstate-law claims.  The Court will rule on the motion for class certification after ruling on motions for \nsummary judgment.  Finally, the Court ORDERS the parties to appear for a status conference on January \n7, 2013 at 3:00 p.m.   \nII.  MOTION TO DISMISS: EXHAUSTION UNDER THE PLRA \nDefendantsโ motion Plaintiffsโ federal claims is based solely on their argument that six of the \nseven plaintiffsโBattiste, Cholewiak, Madrid, Barranca, Paiz, and Vigilโare barred from bringing their \nclaims in this Court because they failed to properly exhaust their claims within the prison as required by \nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA).  For the reasons explained below, the PLRA does not bar any \nof the named plaintiffs from bringing suit.   \nA.  Plaintiff Amador \nThe PLRA provides that โ[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under \nsection 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other \ncorrectional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.โ  42 U.S.C. ยง \n1997e(a).  However, it is โclear from the express language of the [PLRA] that [the statuteโs exhaustion \nrequirement applies] only to โprisoners.โโ  Page v. Torrey, 201 F.3d 1136, 1139 (9th Cir. 2000) (citing \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1997e(a)).  Thus, only those individuals who are prisoners โat the time they file suit must \ncomply with the [PLRAโs] exhaustion requirement[.]โ  Talamantes v. Leyva, 575 F.3d 1021, 1024 (9th \nCir. 2009).  Individuals who have been released from prison altogether need not exhaust their claims \nwithin the available administrative avenues before pressing them in a federal court.  Id.; accord Norton \nv. City of Marietta, 432 F.3d 1145, 1149-51(10th Cir. 2005) (per curiam); Nerness v. Johnson, 401 F.3d \n874, 876 (8th Cir. 2005); Ahmed v. Dragovich, 297 F.3d 201, 210 (3d Cir. 2002). \nThe PLRA defines a prisoner as โany person incarcerated or detained in any facility who is \naccused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law or the \nterms and conditions of parole, probation, pretrial release, or diversionary program.โ  42 U.S.C. ยง \n1997e(h) (emphasis added); see also Page, 201 F.3d at 1139 (โ[T]o fall within the definition of \nโprisoner,โ the individual in question must be currently detained as a result of accusation, conviction, or \n  :  \nInitials of Preparer    PMC \n \n \nCV-90 (06/04)  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 2 of 7 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 170   Filed 12/19/12   Page 3 of 7   Page ID #:1717\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \nCase No.  2:10-CV-1649-SVW-JEM  Date  December 19, 2012 \nTitle  Mary Amador, et al. v. Leroy D. Baca, et al. \n \nsentence for a criminal offense.โ) (emphasis added).  Defendants do not dispute that Amador was not a \nโprisonerโ within the meaning of the PLRA at the time the initial complaint filed on March 5, 2010.  \nThus, Amador was not required to exhaust her claims within the administrative avenues available at \nCRDF before bringing her claims in this Court.   \nB.  Plaintiffs Battiste, Cholewiak, and Madrid \nPlaintiffs Battiste, Cholewiak, and Madrid were added to this action when Plaintiffs filed their \nSecond Amended Complaint on January 13, 2011, joining Amador as additional representative plaintiffs \nfor the Rule 23(b)(3) damages class.  It is undisputed that Battiste, Cholewiak, and Madrid were not in \nprison (at CRDF or elsewhere) when they were added to this action on January 13, 2011.  Defendants \ncontend, however, that the PLRAโs exhaustion requirement applies to them because they were \nโprisonersโ when the initial complaint was filed on March 5, 2010.   \nThe Court has found only one case that has considered the question of whether plaintiffs \nsubsequently added to a suit must have exhausted their claims at the time an initial complaint was filed.  \nIn Riggs v. Valdez, the Court held that the PLRA required newly added plaintiffs to have exhausted \ntheir claims by the time they were added to the complaint, not at the time the initial complaint was filed.  \nNo. 1:09-CV-010-BLW, 2010 WL 4117085, at *5 (D. Idaho Oct. 18, 2010).  Noting that the purpose of \nthe PLRA was, in part, to โreduce the quantity and increase the quality of prisoner lawsuits,โ the Court \nreasoned that    \nIf prisoners cannot amend with newly exhausted claims and are instead directed to start a new \naction, the quantity of prison condition lawsuits would be increased, not decreased, and the \nquality of each of those piecemeal lawsuits would likely tack in a negative direction.  Or, if the \ncases are consolidated, the same practical result is achieved as amendment but with the added \ntime and expense of starting a new proceeding.  Applying Defendantsโ position to this case \nwould presumably have required the filing of a different complaint under a new case number that \ncould then be consolidated, which would waste time and resources. \nId.; see also Vaden v. Summerhill, 449 F.3d 1047, 1050 (9th Cir. 2006) (โBeyond doubt, Congress \nenacted ยง 1997e(a) to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of prisoner suits . . . .โ) (internal \ncitations and quotation marks omitted).  \n \nThe same reasoning applies here.  Defendants do not dispute that Battiste, Cholewiak, and \nMadrid were not in prison on the date they were added to this action.  They could have filed their own \naction in this Court on that date, which would have then been consolidated with the current action, \n  :  \nInitials of Preparer    PMC \n \n \nCV-90 (06/04)  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 3 of 7 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 170   Filed 12/19/12   Page 4 of 7   Page ID #:1718\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \nCase No.  2:10-CV-1649-SVW-JEM  Date  December 19, 2012 \nTitle  Mary Amador, et al. v. Leroy D. Baca, et al. \n \nwasting time and resources.  Thus, because Battiste, Cholewiak, and Madrid were not in prison on the \ndate they were added to this action, the PLRAโs exhaustion requirement did not apply to them.  See also \nRhodes v. Robinson, 621 F.3d 1002, 1007 (9th Cir. 2010) (holding that an inmate may amend a \ncomplaint to add new claims exhausted after the date on which the original complaint was filed but \nbefore the date the amended complaint was submitted); Barnes v. Briley, 420 F.3d 673, 678 (7th Cir. \n2006) (โThe filing of the amended complaint was the functional equivalent of filing a new complaint . . . \nand it was only at that time that it became necessary to have exhausted all of the administrative remedies \n. . . .โ). \n \nC.  Plaintiffs Barranca, Paiz, and Vigil \nPlaintiffs Barranca, Paiz, and Vigil were added to this action when Plaintiffs filed their First \nAmended Complaint on September 10, 2010, joining Amador as representative plaintiffs for the Rule \n23(b)(3) damages class, and as representatives plaintiffs for a new class requesting injunctive relief \nunder Rule 23(b)(2).  It is undisputed that Barranca, Paiz, and Vigil were in custody when they were \nadded to this action on September 10, 2010.2  Defendants contend that they did not exhaust their claims \npursuant to the PLRA. \nโThere is no question that exhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA and that unexhausted claims \ncannot be brought in court.โ Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 211 (2007); see also Albino v. Baca, 697 F.3d \n1023 (9th Cir. 2012) (noting that the PLRA requires โexhaustion of the correctional facilitiesโ \nadministrative remedies.โ).  Exhaustion serves two purposes: first, it gives an administrative agency the \nโโopportunity to correct its own mistakes with respect to the programs it administers before it is haled \ninto federal court[.]โโ  Albino, 697 F.3d 1023 (quoting Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 89 (2006)).  \nSecond, โโexhaustion promotes efficiency.  Claims generally can be resolved much more quickly and \neconomically in proceedings before an agency than in litigation in federal court.โโ  Albino, 697 F.3d \n1023 (quoting Woodford, 548 U.S. at 89).  A prisoner must โโcomplete the administrative review \nprocess in accordance with the applicable procedural rules, including deadlines, as a precondition to \nbringing suit in federal court.โโ  Marella v. Terhune, 568 F.3d 1024, 1027 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting \nWoodford, 548 U.S. at 88).  โThe level of detail necessary in a grievance to comply with the grievance \nprocedures will vary from system to system and claim to claim, but it is the prison's requirements, and \nnot the PLRA, that define the boundaries of proper exhaustion.โ  Akhtar v. Mesa, 11-16629, 2012 WL \n5383038 (9th Cir. Nov. 5, 2012) (quoting Jones, 549 U.S. at 218).   \n \n                                                 \n2 As discussed above, see supra Part II.B, the relevant date is whether these plaintiffs exhausted \ntheir claims by the time they were added to the complaint on September 10, 2010.   \n  :  \nInitials of Preparer    PMC \n \n \nCV-90 (06/04)  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 4 of 7 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 170   Filed 12/19/12   Page 5 of 7   Page ID #:1719\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \nCase No.  2:10-CV-1649-SVW-JEM  Date  December 19, 2012 \nTitle  Mary Amador, et al. v. Leroy D. Baca, et al. \n \nExhaustion under the PLRA is an affirmative defense, and the โโburden of establishing \nnonexhaustion therefore falls on defendants.โโ Albino, 697 F.3d 1023 (quoting Wyatt v. Terhune, 315 \nF.3d 1108, 1112 (9th Cir. 2003)).  To meet their burden, Defendants must show 1) that a grievance \nprocedure existed and 2) that plaintiffs did not exhaust the grievance procedure.  Id.; see also Valoff, \n422 F.3d at 936-37 (โAs we have concluded that there can be no โabsence of exhaustionโ unless some \nrelief remains โavailable,โ a defendant must demonstrate that pertinent relief remained available, whether \nat unexhausted levels of the grievance process or through awaiting the results of the relief already \ngranted as a result of that process.โ).  Relevant evidence demonstrating that a grievance procedure \nexisted includes โstatutes, regulations, and other official directives that explain the scope of the \nadministrative review process; documentary or testimonial evidence from prison officials who \nadminister the review process; and information provided to the prisoner concerning the operation of the \ngrievance procedure in this case . . . .โ Valoff, 422 F.3d at 937; see also Albino, 697 F.3d at 1032 \n(noting that a defendant had met his burden of demonstrating that grievance procedures were available \nby attaching a manual that described the procedure).   \nIn determining whether or not a defendant has met its burden, โthe court may look beyond the \npleadings and decide disputed issues of fact.โ  Wyatt, 315 F.3d at 1119-20; see also Bryant v. Rich, 530 \nF.3d 1368, 1376-77 (11th Cir. 2008) (holding that a court must decide facts on a motion for failure to \nexhaust and noting that โ[r]equiring jury trials to resolve factual disputes over the preliminary issue of \nexhaustion would be a novel innovation for a matter in abatement and would unnecessarily undermine \nCongressโs intent in enacting the PLRA's exhaustion requirement: that is, to reduce the quantity and \nimprove the quality of prisoner suitsโ) (internal citations, quotation marks, and footnotes omitted). \n \nDefendants have not met their burden.  They have failed to provide a single โstatute, regulation, \nor other official directiveโ that explains the scope of the administrative review process at CRDF.  \nInstead, they rely upon the declarations of Deputy Janette Leo, a LASD deputy assigned to the Legal \nUnit at CRDF, and Deputy Janet Barragan, a LASD operations deputy assigned to CRDF.  In their \ndeclarations, both deputies described the grievance procedures at CRDF after stating that they are \nโfamiliar with the administrative remedies procedure for inmates . . . at CRDF.โ  However, their \ndepositions demonstrate that they have little, if any, familiarity with the procedures: Deputy Leo admits \nthat she had โno responsibilityโ for processing inmate complaints; rather, submitted complaints were \nhandled by the โwatch commander.โ  Leo Dep. 19:4-19:9; 25:2-25:8.  Deputy Leoโs only involvement in \nthe complaint process came when prisoners made requests โpertaining towards legal,โ such as requests \nfor the use of the law library, legal forms, or information on the status of certain court orders.  Leo Dep. \n  :  \nInitials of Preparer    PMC \n \n \nCV-90 (06/04)  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 5 of 7 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 170   Filed 12/19/12   Page 6 of 7   Page ID #:1720\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \nCase No.  2:10-CV-1649-SVW-JEM  Date  December 19, 2012 \nTitle  Mary Amador, et al. v. Leroy D. Baca, et al. \n \n24:12-24:25. 3  Deputy Barragan is even less involved in handling prisoner complaints: her primary job \nwas to oversee staffing at CRDF and deal with personnel (i.e. staff) logistics and operations.  Barragan \nDep. 11:15-11:18.  She had no direct responsibility for resolving administrative complaints; on occasion, \nshe was asked by her supervisor to resolve an inmate complaint.  Barragan Dep. 14:15-15:15.   In short, \nalthough their declarations say that they are familiar with the administrative remedies procedure at \nCRDF, the deputiesโ depositions demonstrate that they are not.  Indeed, Deputy Leo explicitly testified \nthat she was not aware of any written policies, rules or regulations regarding the process of inmate \ncomplaints.  Leo Dep. 26:18-27:25.  Deputy Barragan makes a vague reference to an unspecified unit \norder that she claims describes the procedure for filing a complaint, but no such order was provided by \nDefendants.  Barragan Dep. 16:7-17:19.   \n \nDefendants argue that the declarations were submitted for the purpose of โestablishing that there \nwere no records of complaints by certain Plaintiffs in any of LASDโs computer databases in which \ncomplaints are logged or stored.โ  According to Defendants, the deputies are familiar with the method of \nreviewing LASD files and databases for records of administrative complaints and retrieving such \nrecords; and when they searched the files and databases they found no complaints from Plaintiffs \nBarranca, Paiz, and Vigil related to the strip-searches at issue.  According to Defendants, โan exhaustive \nknowledge of the administrative remedy procedure is not necessaryโ for this purpose.  Defendantsโ \nargument highlights their evidentiary shortcoming: although the deputies may be qualified to run a \nsearch of the database system, they are, by Defendantsโ own admission, not qualified to testify what, if \nany, procedures are in place at CRDF for processing inmate complaints.  Defendants had an affirmative \nduty to bring forth evidence that a grievance procedure existed, and evidence that a complaint was not \nin a database fails to do so.        \n \nThe only other evidence that Defendants provide to demonstrate that a grievance procedure is in \nplace at CRDF is a copy of the complaint form allegedly provided to inmates, including one filled out by \nPlaintiff Barranca that was in the LASD database.  See Ex. A to the Decl. of Janettee Leo.  This form \ndoes nothing more than demonstrate that the form exists and that it was in the database: it does not \ndemonstrate that there is a procedure in place for providing the forms to inmates, collecting them, and \nresponding to complaints.  In short, Defendants have failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that a \ngrievance procedure existed.  Cf. Albino, 697 F.3d at 1032 (noting that a defendant had met his burden \nof demonstrating that grievance procedures were available by attaching a manual that described the \n                                                 \n3 Deputy Leoโs role at CRDF is limited to handling civil claims or lawsuits filed against the \nLASDโdealing primarily with complaints and court orders that come from an inmateโs attorney, not \nfrom inmates themselves.

Leroy D. Baca, et al. \n \nprocedure); see also Johnson v. Testman, 380 F.3d 691, 697 (2d Cir. 2004) (remanding to consider \nwhether the regulations covering the grievance procedures were โsufficiently confusing so that a \nprisoner ... might reasonably have believed that he could raise his claim against [the defendant] as part \nof his defense in disciplinary proceedingsโ); Brown v. Croak, 312 F.3d 109, 113 (3d Cir. 2002) (relying \non directives given by prison officials to the inmate regarding the grievance procedure because โ \nโ[a]vailableโ means โcapable of use; at hand,โ and if prison officials inform the prisoner that he cannot \nfile a grievance, the formal grievance proceeding ... was never โavailableโ ... within the meaning of 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1997eโ). \nBecause Defendants have failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that grievance procedures \nexisted at CRDF, their non-exhaustion defense fails.  Thus, the motion to dismiss Plaintiffs Barranaca, \nPaiz, and Vigil for failure to exhaust is DENIED.   \nIII.  CLASS CERTIFICATION \nUnder Rule 23, the Court must determine whether to certify the action as a class action โ[a]t an \nearly practicable time after a person sues or is sued as a class representative.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(c)(1)(A).  However, where โit is more practicable to do so and where the parties will not suffer \nsignificant prejudiceโthe district court has discretion to rule on a motion for summary judgment before \nit decides the certification issue.โ  Wright v. Schock, 742 F.2d 541, 544-45 (9th Cir. 1984); see also \nArnold v. Arizona Dept. of Pub. Safety, 233 F.R.D. 537, 541 (D. Ariz. 2005) (noting that Congress \namended Rule 23 to require class certification โat an early practicable timeโ to account for the โjudicial \npractice of ruling on pretrial motions, including motions for summary judgment, before determining \nwhether to certify a classโ).  Because Plaintiffโs motion for class certification will be substantially \nclarified by a motion for summary judgment, the Court will rule on the motion after considering the \npartiesโ motions for summary judgment.   \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nThe Court hereby MOVES this case to its active calendar.  Furthermore, for the reasons \nexplained in this Order, the Court DENIES Defendantsโ motion to dismiss as to Plaintiffโs Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendment causes of action and BIFURCATES the state-law claims, to be tried at a later \ndate.  The Court will rule on the motion for class certification after ruling on motions for summary \njudgment.  Finally, the Court ORDERS the parties to appear for a status conference on January 7, 2013 \nat 1:30 p.m.   \n \n  :  \nInitials of Preparer    PMC \n \n \nCV-90 (06/04)  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 7 of 7 ",

Id. at 629 & n.6. \n6 Plaintiffs failed to adduce significant proof that Defendants had a pattern and\n7 practice of searching all putative class members under these conditions โ indeed,\n8 the Courtโs analysis revealed that only a very small number were searched under\n9 these conditions.  Id. at 626-29.2  Furthermore, the Court declined to certify a\n10 damages class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) because each case\n11 would require individualized proof of damages, which undermined the class\n12 formatโs superiority.  Id. at 629-35.  The Court also denied a liability issue class\n13 under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(4) on the same grounds โ but it\n14 invited a renewed motion on this issue.  Id. at 635-38.\n15 Plaintiffsโ renewed motion was a bit more than the Court bargained for.  In\n16 essence, it was a polite request for reconsideration.  Plaintiffs proposed an\n17 injunctive class including:\n18 Women in the custody of LA County Jail who, upon their admission\n19 or return to CRDF from outside CRDF, until the time the practice\n20 stops or a date set for the verdict cutoff in this case, were strip/visual\n21 body cavity searched in a group, with other inmates, in an outside bus\n22 stall, including whether there was (a) substandard sanitation policies\n23 (or lack thereof) and/or practices with regard to searches conducted in\n24 the bus bay which threatened the health and safety of inmates trip\n25 searched in the bus bay, (b) a pattern and practice and culture of\n26\n27 2   Plaintiffs also submitted additional declarations from putative class members evidencing\nadditional searches conducted with certain โuncommonโ characteristics.  (Dkt. 247, Decl.\n28 of Lindsey Battle).  But these declarations still admit large variation among the\nnonuniform conditions during the searches at issue.\n2\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 263   Filed 12/18/14   Page 3 of 17   Page ID #:5933\n1 deputy harassment and/or abuse during bus bay strip searches, (c) a\n2 pattern and practice of searching inmates in unreasonably cold air\n3 temperatures and/or precipitation, and/or (d) a policy (or lack thereof)\n4 and/or pattern and practice of failing to consistently protect the privacy\n5 of inmates being strip searched. \n6 This broader class definition hinged on a new (or renewed) theory of commonality. \n7 They argued that the CRDFโs cumulative policies โ including those related to the\n8 uncommon conditions (sanitation, deputy abuse, cold weather, and privacy) โ\n9 increased every inmateโs exposure to the risk of harm through the spread of\n10 disease, which satisfied commonality.  In the alternative, Plaintiffs argued that any\n11 of these enumerated conditions could constitute a subclass.  Plaintiffs also renewed\n12 their request for a liability issue class along the same bounds as their proposed\n13 injunctive class.\n14 Discussion  \n15 Plaintiffsโ motion raises three issues: first, whether the injunctive class\n16 should be expanded; if not, whether a subclass for each uncommon condition is\n17 appropriate; last, whether a liability issue class is appropriate.\n18 I.

OโConnor v. Boeing N. Am., Inc., 184 F.R.D. 311, 319\n25 (C.D. Cal. 1998).

R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).\n5 A class seeking damages is subject to a different standard.  Under Federal\n6 Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs must establish predominance and\n7 superiority.  Courts consider:\n8 (A)  the  class  membersโ  interests  in  individually  controlling  the\n9 prosecution or defense of separate actions;\n10 (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy\n11 already begun by or against class members;\n12 (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of\n13 the claims in the particular forum; and\n14 (D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action.\n15 Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  This list of factors, however, is non-exhaustive.  Local\n16 Joint Exec. Bd. of Culinary/Bartender Trust Fund v. Las Vegas Sands, Inc., 244\n17 F.3d 1152, 1163 (9th Cir. 2001).\n18 When appropriate, the Court may also certify a class as to a particular issue. \n19 Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4).  Although โcourts and commentators are sharply split on\n20 when issue certification is proper,โ the Ninth Circuit endorses 23(c)(4) liability\n21 classes.  2 William Rubenstein, et al., Newberg on Class Actions ยง 4:91 381-82\n22 (citing Valentino v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 97 F.3d 1227 (9th Cir. 1996)); see also\n23 Jiminez v. Allstate Ins. Co.,765 F.3d 1161, 1166-69 (9th Cir. 2014).\n24 A court may also create subclasses, each of which is treated as a class and\n25 subject to the same requirements as one.  Betts v. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd.,\n26 659 F.2d 1000, 1005 (9th Cir. 1981).\n27 II. Expanded Class Definition\n28 A. A Class Including the Uncommon Conditions Lacks Commonality\n4\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 263   Filed 12/18/14   Page 5 of 17   Page ID #:5935\n1 โ[I]n a civil-rights suit, . . . commonality is satisfied where the lawsuit\n2 challenges a system-wide practice or policy that affects all of the putative class\n3 members.โ  Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 868 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing LaDuke\n4 v. Nelson, 762 F.2d 1318 (9th Cir. 1985), abrogated on other grounds by Johnson\n5 v. California, 543 U.S. 499, 504-05 (2005)).  What it means for a policy or practice\n6 to โaffectโ a class member must be divined in light of Wal-Mart, which requires\n7 the possibility of common answers, not the presence of common questions.  Wal-\n8 Mart v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2551 (2011).  In the search for a question yielding\n9 a common answer, the Court must peel back the pleadings and examine the\n10 underlying legal merits.  See id. at 2551-52; Jimenez v. Allstate Ins. Co., 765 F.3d\n11 1161, 1165 (9th Cir. 2014).  For example, in Wal-Mart โ a Title VII\n12 discrimination case โ the ultimate question was โwhy was I disfavored.โ  131 S.\n13 Ct. at 2252.  Here, Plaintiffs appeal to the Fourth Amendment, so the question is\n14 โwas I searched unreasonably.โ  See United States v. Knights, 534 U.S. 112, 118\n15 (2001) (โThe touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness.โ). \n16 Consequently, Plaintiffsโ proffered bases of commonality must be germane to โthe\n17 scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the\n18 justification for initiating it, [or] the place in which it is conductedโ โ the\n19 considerations courts assess when probing reasonableness under the Fourth\n20 Amendment.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979); see also United States v.\n21 Kriesel, 508 F.3d 941, 947 (9th Cir. 2007) (observing that the basic Fourth\n22 Amendment analysis balances the intrusiveness of a search against the\n23 governmentโs justification).  \n24 The uncommon conditionsโ deleterious effect on commonality is apparent. \n25 The uncommon conditions introduce significant variation among the challenged\n26 searches.  Without venturing too far down the path of tautology, Fourth\n27 Amendment analyses, which turn on the circumstances of individual searches, will\n28 differ when the circumstances of each search are decidedly different โ the\n5\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 263   Filed 12/18/14   Page 6 of 17   Page ID #:5936\n1 unmanageable dissimilarity injected by the uncommon would make the quest for a\n2 common Fourth Amendment answer quixotic.  Therefore, the Court cannot certify\n3 a class including the uncommon conditions.3\n4 A counterfactual is illustrative.  If the Court certified the class Plaintiffs\n5 propose, resolution of the case would not create common answers for all the class\n6 members.  For example, it could be unreasonable to search an inmate when the\n7 floor was covered in vermin and filth, the air was frigid, and the deputies yelled\n8 and jeered.  At the same time, it could be reasonable to search an inmate when the\n9 floor was clean, the air temperate, and the deputies polite.  However, the proposed\n10 class would not allow the Court to distinguish between the two, even though the\n11 class would contain those subject to both kinds of searches.  And because it would\n12 not allow the Court to differentiate among the different groups of inmates, the\n13 answers produced by class-wide resolution would not help answer the ultimate\n14 question โ was I searched unreasonably โ for all class members.\n15 Judge Mordue reached an analogous conclusion in Mothersell v. City of\n16 Syracuse, 289 F.R.D. 389 (N.D.N.Y. 2013).  In Mothersell, the plaintiffs sought to\n17 certify a class of those strip-searched pursuant to โall-persons-presentโ clauses in\n18 search warrants.  Id. at 390.  However, the record showed that officers strip-\n19 searched many putative class-members because they had probable cause to do so. \n20 Id. at 395.  Therefore, โ[t]he evidence fail[ed] to show that people who otherwise\n21 [met] the class definition โ that is, people who were strip searched during the\n22 execution of an all-persons-present warrant during the class period โ were strip\n23 searched based on the existence of the all-persons-present clause, rather than on the\n24 facts known to the officers at the time of each search.โ  Id.  In essence, Mothersell\n25 found that a difference in the justifications for the searches destroyed commonality. \n26 See id.  Here, the disparities exist in the manner of the searches.  But both\n27\n28\n3   This analysis merely mirrors the Courtโs prior order.  Amador, 299 F.R.D. at 626-28.\n6\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 263   Filed 12/18/14   Page 7 of 17   Page ID #:5937\n1 considerations are part of Fourth Amendment analyses.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. \n2 And, therefore, the wide variation in the manner of the searches introduced by the\n3 uncommon conditions preclude commonality, just as the differences in justification\n4 prevented Judge Mordue from finding commonality in Mothersell. \n5 Hence, the expanded class suggested by Plaintiffs fails to satisfy Federal\n6 Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) because โ in the context of the Fourth Amendment\n7 claims at issue in this case โ it lacks commonality among its putative members. \n8 See 1 Joseph McLaughlin, McLaughlin on Class Actions ยง 4:7 (11th ed. 2014)\n9 (โWal-Mart will bar certification of proposed classes where adjudication of the\n10 claims will necessitate significant and time-consuming individualized liability\n11 inquiries which undermine the fairness and efficiency of a class-wide\n12 determination.โ).\n13 B. The Increased Risk of Harm Stemming from Some Class\n14 Membersโ Searches Does Not Establish Commonality Among All\n15 Class Members\n16 Plaintiffs, however, push their argument one step further.  They submit that\n17 even though the individual searches were dissimilar, the departmental policies\n18 pertaining to searches in filthy or intemperate conditions affected each inmate,\n19 even if that particular inmate was not searched under those circumstances.4  That\n20 is, Plaintiffs submit that CRDF policies empowered deputies to search some\n21 women under filthy or intemperate conditions.  These searches increased those\n22 womenโs risk of falling ill.  And, as a result, the deputies exposed all class\n23 members to an increased risk of harm by way of contagious disease.  Therefore, a\n24 CRDF policy โaffectedโ all class members, satisfying commonality.  This\n25 argument is flawed.  As already discussed, the uncommon conditions do not\n26\n27 4   Only weather and sanitation are discussed in this section.  Plaintiffsโ risk-of-harm theory is\npremised on the spread of disease.  They have not adduced sufficient proof that verbal\n28 abuse or privacy concerns increase the risk of contagious disease among inmates.  Thus,\nby their own reasoning, those conditions are unrelated to the theory of commonality.\n7\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 263   Filed 12/18/14   Page 8 of 17   Page ID #:5938\n1 โaffectโ each class member in a manner relevant to the Fourth Amendment.  This\n2 inappositeness is the result of Plaintiffsโ attempt to import an Eighth Amendment\n3 doctrine into a Fourth Amendment case โ the equivalent of trying to put a square\n4 peg through a round hole.\n5 Plaintiffsโ reliance on the risk-of-harm theory stems from a misreading of\n6 the case law.  As discussed above, there is no place for this reasoning in a Fourth\n7 Amendment analysis.  The Fourth Amendment examines a searchโs intrusiveness;\n8 another inmateโs noncontemporaneous search has no bearing on oneโs own Fourth\n9 Amendment rights5 โ and Plaintiffs have furnished no authority that it does.  In\n10 short, Plaintiffsโ risk-of-harm theory does not fit the Fourth Amendmentโs\n11 paradigm.\n12 In arguing the contrary, Plaintiffsโ rely on the Ninth Circuitโs recent decision\n13 in Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657 (9th Cir. 2014).  In Parsons, the Ninth Circuit\n14 endorsed the risk-of-harm theory because it was part of the prima facie claim\n15 brought under the Eighth Amendment โ the relevant provision in that case.  See\n16 Parsons, 765 F.3d at 677.  To be specific, there are four elements in an Eighth\n17 Amendment deliberate indifference claim: (1) an existing policy or practice creates\n18 an unreasonable risk of harm; (2) the supervisor was aware that the unreasonable\n19 risk was created; (3) the supervisor was indifferent to that risk; and (4) the injury\n20 resulted from the policy or practice.  Sample v. Diecks, 885 F.2d 1099, 1118 (3d\n21 Cir. 1989).  Thus, a deliberate indifference claim is premised on government\n22 apathy to unsafe conditions โ regardless of whether a โtragic eventโ has occurred\n23 โ so it is possible to enjoin a policy before the actual harm manifests.  Farmer v.\n24 Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 828 (1994); Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 33 (1993);\n25\n26 5   If one is searched in a manner that might harm him or her, he or she has a cognizable\nFourth Amendment injury.  See, e.g., United States v. Edwards, 666 F.3d 877, 885 (4th\n27 Cir. 2011).  However, someone that falls ill from another who fell ill due to an unsanitary\nsearch was not, herself, searched unreasonably.  Therefore, the risk-of-harm theory cannot\n28 bind together a Fourth Amendment class featuring significantly different search\nconditions.\n8\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 263   Filed 12/18/14   Page 9 of 17   Page ID #:5939\n1 see also Brown v. Plata, 131 S. Ct. 1910, 1925 n.3 (2011) (citing Farmer, 511 U.S.\n2 at 834); Thomas v. Ponder, 611 F.3d 1144, 1151 n.5 (9th Cir. 2010). \n3 Consequently, โpolices and practices that expose inmates to a substantial risk of\n4 serious harmโ can be integral to an Eighth Amendment claim, and, therefore, form\n5 the common basis for a class action.  Parsons, 754 F.3d at 677 (9th Cir. 2014); see\n6 also Brown, 131 S. Ct. at 1925 n.3.  However, as explained above, the Fourth\n7 Amendment admits no analogous considerations.  The focus is on each individualโs\n8 search โ the risk of harm derived from anotherโs asynchronous search does not fit\n9 into the analysis.\n10 Indeed, at least one other court also found Parsons inapposite outside the\n11 setting of the Eighth Amendment.  In re WellPoint, Inc. Out-of-Network UCR\n12 Rates Litig., No. MDL 09-2074 PSG (FFMx), 2014 WL 6888549, at *11 n.10\n13 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 3, 2014).  And two more decisions kept the risk-of-harm theory\n14 separate from a searchโs unreasonableness when considering both Fourth and\n15 Eighth Amendment claims.  See Martin v. Sullivan, No. 06-cv-00906, 2011 WL\n16 754886, at *6 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 24, 2011); Jackson v. CDCR, No. 07-cv-01414, 2009\n17 WL 256967, at *4-5 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 3, 2009).\n18 Plaintiffs rely on three cases to challenge the Courtโs interpretation of\n19 Parsons and rejection of the risk-of-harm theory in this case: DG ex rel. Stricklin v.\n20 Devaughn, 594 F.3d 1188 (10th Cir. 2010), Kenneth R. ex rel. Tri-Cnty. CAP,\n21 Inc./GS v. Hassan, 293 F.R.D. 254 (D.N.H. 2013), and Karen L. ex rel. Jane L. v.\n22 Physicians Health Servs., Inc., 202 F.R.D. 94 (D. Conn. 2001).  According to\n23 them, these cases show that Parsons should not be limited to its circumstances;\n24 rather, the risk-of-harm theory it endorsed is generally applicable in commonality\n25 analyses.  However, like Parsons, Devaughn and Kenneth R. involved claims\n26 where the risk-of-harm was part of the underlying legal violation.  Moreover,\n27 Karen L. is outdated after Wal-Mart.\n28 Devaughn ratifies the risk-of-harm theory no more than Parsons.  In\n9\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 263   Filed 12/18/14   Page 10 of 17   Page ID\n #:5940\n1 Devaughn, caseworkers โroutinely fail[ed] to comply with [the] policy of requiring\n2 caseworkers to visit monitor childrenโs safety and placement.โ  594 F.3d at 1195. \n3 These routine failures โallegedly exposed [plaintiffs] to the same unreasonable risk\n4 of harm.โ  Id. at 1195-97.  The common question was โwhether [OK]DHSโs\n5 policies or practices violate class membersโ right to be reasonably free from harm\n6 and imminent risk of harm while in state custody.โ  Id. at 1193.  But, like Parsons,\n7 the risk of harm posed a common question because it was an element of the\n8 underlying legal claim.  Id. at 1196 (โ[C]hildren in state custody have a\n9 constitutional [substantive due process] right to be reasonably safe from harm.โ\n10 (citing Yvonne L. v. New Mexico Depโt of Human Serv., 959 F.2d 883, 892 (10th\n11 Cir. 1992)).  Indeed, all the cases cited by the Devaughn court in supporting the\n12 risk-of-harm theoryโs viability centered on the peculiar nature of child-welfare. \n13 See id. at 1196-97.  As did the authority cited in the Devaughn plaintiffsโ appellate\n14 brief.  See Appelleesโ Resp. in Opp. to Appellantsโ Opening Br. at 16-27.  In this\n15 case, however, Plaintiffs have not shown that the risk of harm from anotherโs\n16 noncontemporaneous search is part of a cognizable Fourth Amendment case.  \n17 Likewise, a New Hampshire District Court certified a class when โthe\n18 Stateโs policies and practices . . . created a systemic deficiency in the availability of\n19 community-based mental health care servicesโ because all class members suffered\n20 the same harm: โa serious risk of unnecessary institutionalizaion.โ  Kenneth R., 293\n21 F.R.D. at 267.  That case involved a federal regulation: 28 C.F.R. ยง 35.130(d).  Id.\n22 at 259.  And, once again, a risk of harm was part of a valid theory of liability under\n23 that particular regulation.  See id. at 267 n.4 (โ[T]he cases seem to indicate, at least\n24 by implication, that no individualized inquires need be made to determine whether\n25 a systemic condition places class members at serious risk of unnecessary\n26 institutionalization; instead, the inquiry can properly turn on systemwide proof.โ). \n27 Both parties endorsed this interpretation of the regulation.  Id.  Accordingly, like\n28 Devaughn and Parsons, the court premised certification on the risk-of-harm theory\n10\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 263   Filed 12/18/14   Page 11 of 17   Page ID\n #:5941\n1 because it was tenable under the regulation. \n2 Last, Karen L. โ which predates Wal-Mart by over a decade โ is no longer\n3 persuasive.  There, the court certified a class of plaintiffs who received health care\n4 from a Medicaid insurer because \n5 each potential class member [was] at risk of suffering the same harms\n6 alleged by the named plaintiffs: denials of coverage without proper\n7 notification; lack of adequate hearing rights to challenge denials, and\n8 the inability to apply for and receive prescription drugs without delay.\n9 . . .  [T]he fact that each plaintiff โhas his or her own circumstancesโ\n10 does  not  preclude  certification  where  plaintiffs  โare  challenging\n11 conditions and practices under a unitary regime.โ . . .  [T]he plaintiffs\n12 share the common circumstance of being enrolled in the PHS medical\n13 plan, and as such, they are subject to the violations of state and federal\n14 law alleged by the plaintiffs.\n15 Karen L. ex rel. Jane L. v. Physicians Health Servs., Inc., 202 F.R.D. 94, 96, 100-\n16 01 (D. Conn. 2001).  This shared predicament generated the common legal issues:\n17 โwhether notice and denial procedures of PHS violate Medicaid statutes, due\n18 process, and state law, and whether the Commissioner has committed similar\n19 violations based upon its contract with PHS.โ  Id. at 100.  These issues, however,\n20 resemble the questions Wal-Mart deemed insufficient.  See 131 S. Ct. at 2551\n21 (โsuffer[ing] a violation of the same provision of lawโ is not a common question);\n22 M.D. ex rel. Stukenberg v. Perry, 675 F.3d 832, 841 (5th Cir. 2012) (finding\n23 โvarious allegations of โsystemic deficienciesโ in the Stateโs administration of its\n24 [conservatorship of children]โ insufficient to raise common questions of fact or\n25 law).  Thus, the Court does not find Karen L. persuasive.\n26 In sum, Plaintiffsโ authority is unconvincing.  Parsons, Devaughn, and\n27 Kenneth R. are confined to their classesโ particular legal claims.  And Karen L.\n28 must defer to Wal-Mart.  Consequently, the risk-of-harm theory cannot function as\n11\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 263   Filed 12/18/14   Page 12 of 17   Page ID\n #:5942\n1 the โglueโ binding this putative classโs issues together.  See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct.\n2 at 2552.6\n3 III. Sub-Classes\n4 Even though expansion of the class is improper, sub-class certification may\n5 be appropriate.  โ[C]ertification of subclasses must satisfy all the elements of the\n6 same standard required of certification of the class as a whole.โ  Walker v. Life Ins.\n7 Co. of the Sw., CV 10-9198 JVS RNBX, 2012 WL 7170602, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Nov.\n8 9, 2012); accord Betts, 659 F.2d at 1005.  Here, the Court would append the\n9 subclasses to the injunctive class, so the subclasses must meet the requirements of\n10 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).  See, e.g., Foster v. City of Oakland,\n11 Nos. C 05-3110 MHP et al., 2009 WL 88433, at *4-5 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 13, 2009). \n12 There are four proposed subclasses: abuse, privacy, sanitation, and weather.  They\n13 are defined as:\n14 1. Women who were present during, experienced or threatened by abuse.\n15 2.  Women who were present when lack of privacy existed, or were\n16 threatened with the prospect of such condition.\n17 3. Women who were personally exposed to, observed or whose health or\n18 safety was threatened by, unsanitary conditions (which include bodily\n19 fluids, trash, sanitary napkins, feces, vomit, bird droppings or feathers,\n20 dead birds, exposure to rodents and vermin, and noticeably dirty or\n21 sticky floors).\n22 4. Women who were exposed to extreme weather (hot, cold, rain) or\n23 whose health or safety was threatened by virtue of the policy or\n24 practice.\n25 Two are too nebulous to ascertain.  The proposed sanitation subclass fails to satisfy\n26 commonality.  A subclass for inclement weather conditions, however, meets\n27\n28 6   This determination, however, does not disturb the Courtโs prior decision certifying an\ninjunctive class.  It only denies Plaintiffsโ request to expand the injunctive class.\n12\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 263   Filed 12/18/14   Page 13 of 17   Page ID\n #:5943\n1 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23โs certification requirements.\n2 A. Abuse Subclass\n3 The Court already declined to certify an abuse subclass.  There is no reason\n4 to revisit that conclusion.\n5 B. Privacy Subclass\n6 There are two fatal defects in the privacy subclass.  First, the subclass cannot\n7 be defined adequately.  Second, the method of identification is clumsy and\n8 ineffective.\n9 The plaintiffs seek to define this subclass as โthose who were present when\n10 lack of privacy existed, or were threatened with the prospect of such conditions.โ \n11 (Dkt. 236, Pl. Renewed Mot., 17:1-3).  That definition is vague and conclusory. \n12 There are no objective criteria for the Court to define the limits of the class.  See\n13 Guido v. L'Oreal, USA, Inc., No. 11-cv-1067, 2013 WL 3353857, at *18 (C.D. Cal.\n14 July 1, 2013) (โThe requirement of an ascertainable class is met as long as the class\n15 can be defined through objective criteria.โ).\n16 Moreover, plaintiffs seek to rely on self-identification.  Plaintiffs argue that\n17 self-identification is appropriate if the subclassโs definition โis sufficiently precise\n18 for potential members to determine whether they belong to the class.โ  (Dkt. 253,\n19 Pl. Reply for Renewed Mot., 13:22-24).  Putative class members would self-\n20 identify โas having been searched when the bus bay was not blocked to the view of\n21 outsiders.โ  (Dkt. 253, Pl. Reply for Renewed Mot., 15:2-3).  That is not\n22 sufficiently precise โ it is inherently subjective, and there are numerous\n23 ambiguities (e.g., how unobstructed must the view of the bus bay been?).  See\n24 OโConnor, 184 F.R.D. at 319 (โClass definition should be precise, objective and\n25 presently ascertainable.โ (citing Manual for Complex Litigation, Third ยง 30.14, at\n26 217 (1995))).\n27 C. Sanitation Subclass\n28 Plaintiffsโ sanitation subclass would include any inmate claiming the bus\n13\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 263   Filed 12/18/14   Page 14 of 17   Page ID\n #:5944\n1 bay contained โone of the following conditions: bird feathers, bird feces, flies,\n2 bodily fluids on the ground during the search process, puddles of water on the\n3 ground (from rain) or trash left behind from previous searches.โ  (Dkt. 236, Pl.\n4 Reply for Renewed Mot. 15:7-12).  This subclass would suffer from significant\n5 commonality issues.  The multifarious considerations would ensure a wide range of\n6 experiences: one plaintiff might have been searched when a single piece of litter\n7 was in the bus bay, another in a puddle of dried menstrual blood against a wall\n8 covered in animal feces while surrounded by dead vermin.  Moreover, there is no\n9 evidence of a unifying policy touching on the enumerated sanitation issues.  Thus,\n10 the proposed subclass embraces too broad a range of circumstances โ at least as\n11 plaintiffs currently define it โ to present a single question capable of resolution. \n12 See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551.\n13 D. Weather Subclass\n14 A subclass based on weather, however, is objectively ascertainable.  The\n15 subclass would be based on searches conducted in temperatures at or less than\n16 sixty-eight degrees.  The temperature can be independently verified by\n17 meteorological data, and the putative members would only need to indicate how\n18 many times they were searched and how many of those searches were conducted\n19 indoors.  Similarly, self-identification can determine whether it was raining during\n20 oneโs search.  These objective criteria are straightforward and well-suited for self-\n21 identification.  See Forcellati v. Hylandโs Inc., No. 12-cv-1983, 2014 WL 1410264\n22 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 9, 2014) (self-identification based on whether plaintiff purchased\n23 defendantโs medicine); McCrary v. Elations Co., No. 130cv099242, 2014 WL\n24 1779243 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 13, 2014) (self-identification based on whether plaintiff\n25 purchased defendantโs supplement); Zeisel v. Diamond Foods, Inc., No. C 10-\n26 01192, 2011 WL 2221113 (N.D. Cal. June 7, 2011) (self-identification based on\n27\n28\n14\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 263   Filed 12/18/14   Page 15 of 17   Page ID\n #:5945\n1 whether plaintiff purchased specially branded nuts).7\n2 IV. Liability Issue Class\n3 The final question is whether to certify a Rule 23(c)(4) liability issue class\n4 along the same parameters as the Rule 23(b)(2) class (and subclass).  Under\n5 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(4), the issue class must meet the same\n6 requirements as it would under either 23(b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3).  See Valentino, 97\n7 F.3d at 1234.  Because the proposed issue class is part of Plaintiffsโ pursuit of\n8 damages, the issue class must meet the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil\n9 Procedure 23(b)(3).  After the Courtโs last order, the only remaining issue is\n10 superiority.\n11 A. Individual Incentive To Litigate\n12 The first issue is whether plaintiffs would have an individual incentive to\n13 litigate their claims.  See, e.g., Butler v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 727 F.3d 796, 798\n14 (7th Cir. 2013).  Although the Court recognizes the potential for bias, it credits Mr.\n15 Littโs declaration.  (Dkt. 237, Decl. of Barrett Litt).  The potential reward is too\n16 small to entice many attorneys to pursue these cases, leaving many plaintiffs\n17 without a viable remedy.\n18 B. Judicial Efficiency\n19 Judicial efficiency is more contested.  The Court recognizes some merit in\n20 all the efficiency interests proffered by the plaintiffs.  Some time will be saved\n21 without individualized Monell showings.  The risk of inconsistent verdicts is real\n22 (although the threat always exists).  Individual trials could overwhelm counsel and\n23 the court, even though most cases would likely settle after a few were litigated. \n24 And certification would facilitate global resolution.  The Court, however, knew of\n25 these efficiencies when it issued its last order.  It is not the facts that have changed\n26 โ rather, the law has done so.  Recent cases persuade the Court that it previously\n27\n28 7    Defendants do not challenge certification on any other ground.  The Court is satisfied that\nthe other requirements are met.\n15\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 263   Filed 12/18/14   Page 16 of 17   Page ID\n #:5946\n1 demanded too strong an efficiency showing, and a liability class is appropriate\n2 under the circumstances.\n3 Most pertinent to this case is the Ninth Circuitโs recent endorsement of\n4 liability issue classes: โ[s]o long as the plaintiffs were harmed by the same\n5 conduct, disparities in how or by how much they were harmed did not defeat class\n6 certification.โ  Jimenez, 765 F.3d at 1168.\n7 Moreover, Jimenez found Judge Stranchโs opinion in In re Whirlpool, 722\n8 F.3d 838 (6th Cir. 2013) and Judge Posnerโs opinion in Butler v. Sears Roebuck\n9 and Co., 727 F.3d 796 (7th Cir. 2013), โcompelling.โ  Jimenez, 765 F.3d at 1168.\n10 Butler was particularly emphatic in its approval of liability issue classes: \n11 It would drive a stake through the heart of the class action device, in\n12 cases in which damages were sought rather than an injunction or a\n13 declaratory judgment, to require that every member of the class have\n14 identical damages.  If the issues of liability are genuinely common\n15 issues, and the damages of individual class members can be readily\n16 determine in individual hearings, in settlement negotiations, or by\n17 creation of subclasses, the fact that damages are not identical across all\n18 class members should not preclude class certification.\n19 727 F.3d at 801; see also McReynolds v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith,\n20 Inc., 672 F.3d 482 (7th Cir. 2012).8\n21 The sum of these cases indicates that the Court was too demanding in its\n22 previous order.  The Ninth Circuit โ and respected jurists across the country โ\n23 have energetically endorsed the concept.  And such enthusiastic embrace compels\n24 reconsideration in this case.  This case may involve individualized damages\n25 calculations.  Even so, the efficiency of a single liability determination regarding\n26\n27 8   Although the parties have not addressed the notice issue that accompanies a damages class,\nthere is no indication that a notice and opt-out procedure would be infeasible under the\n28 circumstances.  See In re Whirlpool, 722 F.3d at 861 (โ[A]ny class member who wishes to\ncontrol his or her own litigation may opt out of the class under Rule 23(c)(2)(B)(v).โ).\n16\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 263   Filed 12/18/14   Page 17 of 17   Page ID\n #:5947\n1 the common procedures used by CRDF deputies is sufficient for Federal Rule of\n2 Civil Procedure 23(c)(4).  The Court is therefore convinced that an issue class\n3 should be certified along the same parameters as the Federal Rule of Civil\n4 Procedure 23(b)(2) class.\n5 Conclusion\n6 For the foregoing reasons, the Court:\n7 1. DENIES Plaintiffsโ renewed motion to expand the scope of the\n8 injunctive class.\n9 2. GRANTS Plaintiffsโ renewed motion certify a weather subclass but\n10 DENIES Plaintiffsโ renewed motion to certify all other subclasses.\n11 3. GRANTS Plaintiffsโ renewed motion to certify an issue class for the\n12 purpose of liability along the same parameters as the injunctive class\n13 and subclass. \n14\n15 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n16\n17 Dated: December 18, 2014\n18                                                           \nSTEPHEN V.

Introduction \n \nBefore the Court is a motion for final approval of a class action settlement filed by Lead \nPlaintiffs Mary Amador et al. in the class action lawsuit listed above. The County of Los Angeles and \nthe Los Angeles County Sheriffโs Department (collectively โDefendantsโ) do not oppose this motion. \nFor the reasons articulated below, the Court GRANTS the motion for final approval of the class action \nsettlement. \n \nII.  Factual and Procedural Background \n \nLead Plaintiffs Mary Amador et al. represent a class of female inmates of the Los Angeles \nCounty Sheriffโs Department (โLASDโ) who contend that highly invasive body cavity inspections \nconducted during the relevant class period (March 5, 2008 to January 1, 2015) violated their Fourth \nAmendment rights. Dkt. 449 at 1. These searches took place at the Century Regional Detention Facility \n(โCRDFโ) operated by LASD in Lynwood, California. After certification of several classes and sub-\nclasses, Dkt. 327, the Court granted Plaintiffโs Motion for Summary Judgment on June 7, 2017. Dkt. \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 1 of 24 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 463   Filed 08/11/20   Page 2 of 24   Page ID\n#:16202\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n8/11/2020 \nCase No.  2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v. Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \n361. Following a prolonged period of negotiation and mediation, the parties made a Motion for \nPreliminary Approval of Class Action Settlement. Dkt. 387. The Court initially denied the motion \nbecause it diverted $3 million in settlement funds to contracts between the County of Los Angeles (โthe \nCountyโ) and certain for-profit and non-profit entities to develop gender-responsive policies at LASD \nfacilities, which the Court found reduced the amount of funds available to the victims. Dkt. 394. After \nthe parties presented the Court with a revised settlement that eliminated the diversion of $3 million in \nclass funds, the Court granted preliminary approval to the settlement agreement. Dkt. 399.  \n \nThe revised Settlement Agreement requires LASD to pay a total of $53 million dollars into a \nsettlement fund over a period of three years. Dkt. 395-11 (โthe Settlement Agreementโ). The distribution \nof funds provided in the Settlement Agreement includes: \n \n๏ท  Incentive awards to nine named plaintiffs of $10,000 each. \n๏ท  Third-party class settlement administration costs by the chosen administrator, JND Legal \nAdministration (โJNDโ), which are currently $672,185.96 based on incurred and estimated \nfees associated with administration of settlement claims. See Dkt. 451 at 7-8. \n๏ท  A provision giving Class Counsel the right to apply for attorneyโs fees of up to one-third of \nthe Class Fund as well as litigation costs, with final approval over any award of attorneyโs \nfees at the Courtโs discretion. \n๏ท  The remainder of the Class Fund to be distributed to class members under a points-based \nallocation formula (described in more detail below). \n \nThe Class includes a total of 94,857 members, based on the contact information available to the \nparties and JND from the Countyโs records. Claims made by class members are subject to a points-based \ndistribution formula. See Dkt. 395-1 at 10-12. The distribution formula developed in the course of \nmediation by the parties is premised on the changing conditions and level of privacy across the multi-\nyear class period. Id. at 10. It allocates increasing point totals for searches endured under worse \nconditions during earlier periods in the class. Id. at 11. Class members receive proportionate recoveries \n \n1 Plaintiffs cite to the unrevised Settlement Agreement at various points in their motion for final approval of the class \nsettlement. See Dkt. 449 at 4-5. Because the revised Settlement Agreement includes relatively simple alterations to the \nsettlement terms, this error does not alter the Courtโs analysis.  \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 2 of 24 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 463   Filed 08/11/20   Page 3 of 24   Page ID\n#:16203\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n8/11/2020 \nCase No.  2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v. Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \nbased on the total number of searches they have endured, because their recovery is tied to their \nproportionate share of the total points awarded to the class. Id. Class members were also given the \nopportunity to opt-out of the settlement during the notice period. Id. at 24-25. While up to 250 members \nwere permitted to opt-out under the Settlement Agreementโs terms before Defendants were able to \nwithdraw from the settlement, only six class members have done so. Dkt. 451 at 6. \n \nOn January 6, 2020, JND began to send notices alerting class members to the settlement. The \nAdministrator sent notices via text message to 58,272 mobile phone number representing 39,567 class \nmembers. Dkt. 451 at 2. The Administrator also sent 54,903 emails to 33,229 class members. Id. Finally, \nJND sent notices via mail to 71,676 class members. Id. JND estimates that 91.5% of the settlement class \nhas received a text, email, or mailing that was not returned as undeliverable. Id. at 3. JND also utilized \nupdated contact information provided by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to \nsend additional notice to class members and locate additional mailing addresses. Id. at 4-5. JND \npurchased internet advertising, set up a settlement website, and provided a toll-free phone number to \nfacilitate submission of claims to the settlement. Id. at 5-6. As of July 6, 2020, JND has received almost \n40,000 claims, and has approved 25,528. Id. at 607. 9,940 claims have deficiencies that JND is currently \naddressing, and it anticipates that approximately one-half of those claims will ultimately be approved. \nDkt. 449 at 9. This means that roughly one-third of class members will receive a distribution from the \nsettlement fund, a figure that Class Counsel (who are specialists in this area of civil rights litigation) \nassert is an especially high claims rate for this area of class action litigation. See Dkt. 450 at 3. Class \nCounsel estimates that the average claim will be approximately $1000, and that the highest claims in the \nsettlement will be closer to $10,000. However, given the pro rata distribution model, until all previously \ndeficient claims are processed and either approved or denied, these figures cannot be calculated with \ncertainty. \n \nIII.  Legal Standard \n \nApproval of a proposed class action settlement is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23(e). โ[T]he 2018 amendment to Rule 23(e) establishes core factors district courts must consider when \nevaluating a request to approve a proposed settlement.โ Zamora Jordan v.

Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \nRule 23(e) now provides that the Court may approve a class action settlement only after a \nhearing and only on a finding that it is fair, reasonable, and adequate after considering whether: \n \n(A) the class representatives and class counsel have adequately represented the class; \n(B) the proposal was negotiated at arm's length; \n(C) the relief provided for the class is adequate, taking into account: \n(i) the costs, risks, and delay of trial and appeal; \n(ii) the effectiveness of any proposed method of distributing relief to the class, \nincluding the method of processing class-member claims; \n(iii) the terms of any proposed award of attorney's fees, including timing of \npayment; and \n(iv) any agreement required to be identified under Rule 23(e)(3); and \n(D) the proposal treats class members equitably relative to each other. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2). โUnder Rule 23(e), both its prior version and as amended, fairness, \nreasonableness, and adequacy are the touchstones for approval of a class-action settlement.โ Zamora, \n2019 WL 1966112, at *2. โThe purpose of the amendment to Rule 23(e)(2) is [to] establish a consistent \nset of approval factors to be applied uniformly in every circuit, without displacing the various lists of \nadditional approval factors the circuit courts have created over the past several decades.โ Id. Factors that \nthe Ninth Circuit has typically considered include (1) the strength of plaintiffs' case; (2) the risk, \nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of further litigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class action \nstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered in settlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed \nand the stage of the proceedings; and (6) the experience and views of counsel.

Securities Litigation, 2019 WL \n3290770, at *6 (N.D. Cal. July 22, 2019); see also Graves v. United Indus. Corp., 2020 WL 953210, at \n*4 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 24, 2020). \n \n \nIV.  Analysis \n \na.  Class Counsel have adequately represented the Class. \n \nThe Court finds that Class Counsel and the Class Representatives have adequately represented \nthe class during the course of litigation. The Class Representatives were each deposed during this \nlitigation, and Class Counsel prevailed on two motions for class certification and a dispositive motion \nwith regard to liability at summary judgment. Class Counsel conducted extensive discovery into the \nconditions in which strip searches occurred at CRDF, held a large number of depositions, and hired \nexpert witnesses for multiple discrete issues relevant to establishing liability. See Dkt. 410 at 50-52 \n(summarizing litigation efforts of Class Counsel in table form). Class Counsel, in conjunction with JND, \nhave also facilitated substantial notice and outreach to the relatively disparate and sometimes difficult to \ncontact class of more than 94,000 individuals, which has resulted in a relatively high claims rate of \nbetween 33% and 40%, pending final verification of deficient claims forms. Dkt. 451 at 6-7. Their \nconduct both during litigation and after settlement was reached was adequate in all respects, and \nsupports approval of the Settlement Agreement. \n \nb.  The settlement was negotiated at armโs length. \n \nThe Court finds that this settlement was clearly negotiated at armโs length and is the product of \n(lengthy) non-collusive negotiation between Class Counsel and Defendants. The parties reached a \nsettlement agreement following three full days of in-person settlement conferences before the Hon. \nGeorge H. King (Ret.). Dkt. 450 at 1. Settlement negotiations began only after the Court granted \nsummary judgment on liability for Plaintiffs, and lasted more than two years before the parties reached a \nfinal agreement. The case was litigated by the parties for approximately six years prior to settlement \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 5 of 24 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 463   Filed 08/11/20   Page 6 of 24   Page ID\n#:16206\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n8/11/2020 \nCase No.  2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v. Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \nnegotiations being initiated in earnest. This course of proceeding strongly suggests a non-collusive \nsettlement has been reached.  \nWhile not necessary for approval because this class has previously been certified by the Court, \nDkt. 327, the Court additionally notes that the settlement agreement does not contain (1) a \ndisproportionate distribution of the settlement to Class Counsel (any fee award is subject to the Courtโs \ndiscretion), (2) a clear sailing arrangement for separate payment of attorneyโs fees, or (3) a reversion for \nunclaimed funds to the defendant. See In re Bluetooth Headset Prod. Liab. Litig. 654 F.3d 935, 946-47 \n(9th Cir. 2011) (instructing district courts to scrutinize settlement agreements for โsubtle signsโ that \nclass counsel have permitted self-interest to โinfectโ the negotiations). \nc.  The relief provided for the class is adequate \n \nTo determine whether the relief provided for the class is adequate, courts must consider: (i) the \ncosts, risks, and delay of trial and appeal, (ii) the effectiveness of any proposed method of distributing \nrelief to the class, (iii) the terms of any proposed award of attorney's fees, and (iv) any side agreement \nrequired to be identified under Rule 23(e)(3). Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(C). \n \nThe Court finds that each of these factors favors granting final approval to the settlement. The \nCourt granted summary judgment to the class solely on liabilityโ no clear procedure had been \ndeveloped to present the damages claims to a jury on a classwide basis given the relative circumstances \nof the different class members across the seven year period. See Dkt. 327 at 8 (re-certifying the class \nsolely with regard to liability under Rule 23(c)(4) and noting that individual damages calculations will \nbe necessary to reach a final conclusion of the litigation). The class faced the possibility that no \nworkable arrangement for establishing classwide damages would be developed, as well as the possibility \nthat any final judgment would lead to reversal on appeal. Moreover, the Court finds that this settlement \nis fair with respect to $53 million figure given the size of the class, an issue discussed in more detail in \nthe Courtโs accompanying analysis of Class Counselโs motion for attorneyโs fees. See infra Part 2.II.a.i. \nThe Court finds it sufficient to note here that both the total dollar figure of the settlement fund and the \naverage recovery per class member are in line with similar large-scale settlements involving strip \nsearches at detention facilities. See Dkt. 410 at 29-36 (summarizing strip search settlements reviewed by \nthe Court).  \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 6 of 24 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 463   Filed 08/11/20   Page 7 of 24   Page ID\n#:16207\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n8/11/2020 \nCase No.  2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v. Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \n \nThe court addresses the method of distributing relief (here monetary claims) in the sections \nbelow regarding equitable treatment of class members, and finds it an effective method for distributing \nrelief given the facts of this case. The proposed fee award provided by the Settlement Agreement is \nsubject to the Courtโs discretion and is addressed at length in the accompanying Order granting Class \nCounsel attorneyโs fees. Finally, no side agreements that must be identified under Rule 23(e)(3) have \nbeen disclosed by the parties for the Courtโs consideration. The Court finds that the relief provided by \nthe settlement agreement is adequate for the purposes of Rule 23(e)(2)(C) \n \nd.  Class members are treated equitably.  \n \nThe Court also finds that the settlement agreement treats class members equitably. The Court has \npreviously discussed and approved of the points-based distribution formula as an appropriate manner of \napproximating the severity of the constitutional injuries suffered by individual class members. See Dkt. \n394 at 12. The Court finds that this formula appropriately seeks to provide more substantial \ncompensation to class members who experienced more frequent searches, and class members who \nexperienced searches in harsher conditions. Dkt. 395-1 at 10-12. It also ensures that those individuals \nwho were searched very frequently receive the highest awards within the settlement class. The $200 \nminimum claim size is a reasonable figure to incentivize class members to make the effort to participate \nand submit claim forms, and ensures that as large a fraction of the class participate in the settlement as \npossible.  \n \ne.  Other factors not expressly included in Rule 23(e)(2) favor final approval as well. \n \nThe amendments to Rule 23 do โnot โdisplace any factorโ previously announced by the Ninth \nCircuit, but instead โfocus the court and the lawyers on the core concerns of procedure and substance \nthat should guide the decision whether to approve the proposal.โโ Shin v. Plantronics, Inc., 2019 WL \n2515827, at *4 (N.D. Cal. June 17, 2019); see Advisory Committee Notes, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, subdiv. \n(e)(2) (2018). While the Court believes that its previous analysis has addressed all the other factors the \nNinth Circuit has previously instructed district courts to consider at final approval, it also notes that two \nadditional factors not discussed above also favor final approval. See Churchill Village, L.L.C. v. General \nElectric, 361 F.3d 566, 575 (9th Cir. 2004) (citing Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1026) (citing โthe presence of a \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 7 of 24 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 463   Filed 08/11/20   Page 8 of 24   Page ID\n#:16208\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n8/11/2020 \nCase No.  2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v. Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \ngovernmental participant and โthe reaction of the class membersโ as relevant factors in analyzing class \nsettlements). First, the County is a party to this settlement, and supports the proposed settlement. \nSecond, the reaction of the class supports approval of the settlementโ more than 40,000 claims have \nbeen submitted, approximately 30,000 will be approved given JNDโs projections, and only twelve \nindividuals (setting aside standing issues that may further reduce that number) have expressed objections \nto the settlement agreement.  \n \nf.  Incentive payments to class representatives \n \n โ[N]amed plaintiffs, as opposed to designated class members who are not named plaintiffs, are \neligible for reasonable incentive payments.โ Staton v. Boeing Co., 327 F.3d 938, 977 (9th Cir. 2003). \nโIncentive awards are discretionary . . . and are intended to compensate class representatives for work \ndone on behalf of the class, to make up for financial or reputational risk undertaken in bringing the \naction, and, sometimes, to recognize their willingness to act as a private attorney general.โ Rodriguez v. \nW. Pub. Corp., 563 F.3d 948, 958-59 (9th Cir. 2009). \nThe settlement agreement calls for incentive payments of $10,000 to nine different lead \nplaintiffs, for a total of $90,000. Dkt. 395-1 at 9. The Court finds these payments, individually and in \ntotal, are appropriate given the overall settlement of $53 million. As the parties note, the large number of \nlead plaintiffs is justifiable given the need for some lead plaintiffs to have been in custody in order to \nseek the injunctive relief the class previously sought, and to represent different subclasses created at \nvarious points in this litigation. Dkt. 449 at 23-24. Lead plaintiffs were also required to disclose intimate \ndetails of their experiences to support their claims at their depositions. Id. The Court finds these \nincentive payments to be reasonable and not disproportionate given the expected average claim of \napproximately $1000 for unnamed class members, and the fact that the $90,000 constitutes a very small \nfraction of the total settlement amount of $53 million.  \n \ng.  Objections raised by class members \n \nHaving analyzed the specific factors articulated in Rule 23(e)(2), the Court now addresses \nobjections made by class members. JND received a total of five objections, and the Court and Class \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 8 of 24 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 463   Filed 08/11/20   Page 9 of 24   Page ID\n#:16209\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n8/11/2020 \nCase No.  2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v. Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \nCounsel also received letters from individual class members expressing objections as well. See Dkt. 450-\n1 through Dkt. 450-12, excluding Dkt. 450-11 (collecting various objections); see also Dkt. 461 \n(additional letter received by the Court from Tanya Woods).  \n \ni.  Concerns beyond the reach of this Court. \n \nBecause of the widespread publication of the Class Notice in an attempt to ensure that as many \nclass members as possible submit claims, a number of individuals who do not appear to be eligible for \nparticipation in the class have lodged objections stating that they were strip searched at CRDF before or \nafter the class period of March 5, 2008 to January 1, 2015. See Dkt. 450, Ex. B, C, D; Dkt. 461. At \nsummary judgment, Defendants represented to the Court that strip searches were not being used in any \nsubstantial manner after January 2015. The Court relied on this representation in dismissing the claims \nfor classwide injunctive relief. Class Counsel state that while they have heard โoccasional complaintsโ \nregarding strip searches, they have no information that would suggest any widespread course of strip \nsearch use after January 2015. Dkt. 449 at 12-13.  \n \nThe Court finds that (setting aside the standing issue that the Court will discuss later) these \nobjections cannot be given substantial weight with regard to final approval of the class settlement. The \nCourt previously made a finding based on substantial evidence that the appropriate period for \nconsideration of these constitutional claims on a classwide basis ended in January 2015, and individual \nobjections based on allegedly unconstitutional searches that occurred after the end of the class period are \nnot relevant to whether a settlement addressing claims arising from March 2008 to January 2015 should \nbe approved. Similarly, alleged searches that occurred before the class period began (and are time-barred \nunder Californiaโs two-year statute of limitations for ยง 1983 claims) are not relevant to the Courtโs \ndecision to approve or deny final approval of the settlement before the Court.  \n \nii.  Individualized objections to claim recovery. \n \nOther objectors raise individualized concerns with regard to their personal experiences being \nstrip searched, or argue that because of those circumstances, they deserve a larger portion of the \nsettlement fund than they are entitled to under the points-based distribution formula in the Settlement \nAgreement. See Dkt. 450, Ex. E, F, G, L (Garcia late opt-out and objection). The Court recognizes that \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 9 of 24 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 463   Filed 08/11/20   Page 10 of 24   Page ID\n#:16210\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n8/11/2020 \nCase No.  2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v. Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \nindividual class members may feel strongly that their individual experiences deserve a higher level of \nmonetary compensation, but a more detailed, subjective case-by-case assessment, in a class of \napproximately 94,000 individuals, would not be feasible and would both erode the settlement fund \nthrough additional administrative fees and delay final distribution of the funds to class members. To the \nextent that these individuals feel that this settlement is inadequate, their proper remedy would be to opt-\nout, as a small number of other class members have done, an option which is clearly provided in the \nemail and first-class mail notice distributed by JND. See Dkt. 451, Ex. A, B, C, and D. Each form of \nnotice also clearly states the approximate range of the claim recovery, with a $200 minimum and the \npotential for โthousandsโ of dollars for individuals who endured many searches. Id. As discussed above, \nthe Court finds that the points-based distribution formula is an equitable form of โrough justice,โ \nintended to approximate the relative severity of the constitutional violations each class member received, \nbut that it cannot perfectly compensate each class member based on their subjective assessment of the \nextent of their injuries. In re Volkswagen \"Clean Diesel\" Mktg., Sales Practices, & Prod. Liab. Litig., \n895 F.3d 597, 611 (9th Cir. 2018) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). These objections do \nnot alter the Courtโs view of the Settlement Agreement. \niii.  Attorneyโs fees. \n \nA number of objections were lodged to the size of the attorneyโs fees proposed in the Settlement \nAgreement. See Dkt. 450, Ex. H, Ex. I. While only a limited number of such objections have been made, \nand some of these objections misinterpret the maximum size of the proposed attorneyโs fee award \npossible under the Settlement Agreement, the Court has considered these objections in conjunction with \nits independent duty to assess the reasonableness of any proposed fee award. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(h). \nThe fee award structure in the Settlement Agreement is entirely dependent on this Courtโs approval and \ndetermination of the appropriate award in these circumstances. See Dkt. 395-1 at 18. The non-binding \nstructure of the attorneyโs fee award provided in the Settlement Agreement does not raise concerns with \nrespect to whether final approval of the settlement should be granted. \n \niv.  Ms. Shorterโs objections. \n \nThe Court first notes that it is unclear whether Ms. Shorter, who is a class member but has opted-\nout of the settlement to pursue her own individual claims, Dkt. 429, has standing to object to the class \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 10 of 24 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 463   Filed 08/11/20   Page 11 of 24   Page ID\n#:16211\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n8/11/2020 \nCase No.  2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v. Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \nsettlement. See Newberg on Class Actions ยง13:23 (5th ed.), 13:23 Standing to objectโOpt-outs. \n(โ[c]lass members who opt out of the class at certification or at settlement are no longer considered class \nmembers, and hence Rule 23 does not give them standing to object to the settlementโ); see also Glass v. \nUBS Financial Services, Inc., 2007 WL 221862, *8 (N.D. Cal. 2007) aff'd 331 Fed. Appx. 452 (9th Cir. \n2009) (district court held that objector who opted-out lacks standing to object, objector not referenced in \nNinth Circuit decision affirming district court). Nevertheless, the Court will construe her objections as \nequivalent to an amicus brief and address them below. \n \n  Ms. Shorterโs objections do not raise issues the Court finds compelling. Dkt. 452; Dkt. 429. Her \nargument that settlement recovery is โminisculeโ and her assertion that certain individual class members \ncould instead receive six or seven figure recoveries if they proceeded individually is largely speculative, \nand does not properly focus on the best result for the class as a whole. Moreover, the Settlement \nAgreement expressly permitted up to 250 members of the class to opt-out and pursue individual \ndamagesโ the fact that so few class members have chosen to do so suggests that the settlement \nrepresents a reasonable recovery for class members, and that they have little appetite for pursuing these \nclaims individually. The Court also gives substantial weight to Class Counselโs opinion regarding the \nvalue of the class claims on this topic, given their specific expertise with this manner of large-scale \nprisoner litigation and extensive period of negotiation with the County. See Dkt. 410 at 3-10, 81-83. The \nCourt also expressly declined to certify a damages class in its prior Orders, and absent a settlement \nwould have required individualized damages determination in order for class members to take these \nclaims to trial. \n \nMs. Shorterโs proposal that JND should instead calculate the points for each individual member \nprior to the opt-out deadline, and permit class members to go through a second opt-out period after \nlearning their specific point allocation (and resulting monetary recovery) would cause a substantial and \nunnecessary delay in distribution of funds and incur additional administrative expenses. Her request that \nindependent class counsel be appointed to consult (free of charge) with class members on an individual \nbasis to determine whether they should pursue an alternative course of legal action would erode the \nfunds available to the class and is unsupported by caselaw on Rule 23 regarding circumstances that \nrequire appointment of independent counsel. The Court does not find that the issues she has raised \nregarding the contents of the Class Notice, or the ability of class members to gain access to the full \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 11 of 24 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 463   Filed 08/11/20   Page 12 of 24   Page ID\n#:16212\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n8/11/2020 \nCase No.  2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v.

Administrative Issues \n \ni.  Opt-Outs \n \nSix individuals have requested to opt-out of the class settlement. One of the opt-out notices was \nreceived late. Dkt. 450-12. The Court acts in its discretion pursuant to the Settlement Agreement to \npermit this late opt-out, and these individuals are listed below: \n \n1.  Valerie Rehling \n2.  Jessica Rivera Hernandez \n3.  Lyubox V. Shur a.k.a โLuba Shurโ \n4.  Pik Yue \n5.  Tammy Lynn Dayton \n6.  Natalie Elizabeth Garcia \n \nii.  Administrative issues arising from COVID-19 and class member letters to the \nCourt.  \n \nThe Court also makes note of an administrative issue that arose in the course of the settlement \napproval process. After notice was mailed to the class, a number of class members sent letters to the \nCourt directly, some expressing objections to the settlement and others describing their experiences, \nsometimes including personal details regarding the conditions they endured at CRDF. The Courtโs \nadministrative docketing system interpreted these letters as appearances in the lawsuit, and filed a \nnumber of these letters on the docket, resulting in documents filed by the parties in this lawsuit being \nsent to those class members and their letters being made public. Class Counsel filed an ex parte motion \nto correct the record and strike accounts of personal experiences that included personal details and \npersonal identifying information that should not have been disclosed in this manner. Dkt. 426. The Court \ngranted this motion and struck each of the โappearancesโ that had been erroneously entered based on \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 12 of 24 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 463   Filed 08/11/20   Page 13 of 24   Page ID\n#:16213\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n8/11/2020 \nCase No.  2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v. Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \nthese letters, after assessing each one and determining that it could not be plausibly considered an \nobjection to the settlement. Dkt. 436.  \n \nIn order to prevent future inadvertent disclosure of personal information, the Court instituted \nadditional measures to review any new letters received in this lawsuit prior to filing on the docket. Since \nMarch 2020, the Court has reviewed each new letter mailed to the Court in camera and if it could \nplausibly be construed as an objection to the settlement, ordered it filed on the docket. Other letters \nsharing detailed personal information, seeking to be included in the claims process, or raising concerns \nrelated to CRDF recordkeeping relevant only to specific class members were ordered forwarded to Class \nCounsel to address with JNDโs assistance. The Central District issued General Order 20-05 regarding \nCOVID-19 shortly after the Court adopted this policy, and many of the Courtโs administrative staff \ntransitioned to remote work. As a result, the Court learned only upon reviewing briefing in advance of \nthe final approval hearing that certain letters had not been properly filed on the docket as objections, \nalthough they had previously been reviewed and sorted by the Court. The Court has since corrected this \ninternal administrative error. See Dkt. 459; Dkt. 460; Dkt. 461; but see Dkt. 462 (expressing a desire to \nbe notified of future proceedings, which the Court entered as a notice of appearance rather than an \nobjection). All other letters, which cannot reasonably be construed as objections to the settlement and \ngenerally seek inclusion in the class or to share personal experiences, have now been delivered to Class \nCounsel.2 \n \niii.  Late Claims \n \nPlaintiff state that there have been an additional 129 late claims filed since the June 4 cutoff date \nin the settlement agreement, and request that these late claims be approved by the Court. Dkt. 449 at 4. \nSection II ยถ 29 of the revised Settlement Agreement gives the Court the ability approve any late claims \nthat are โfiled prior to the Final Approval Hearing.โ Dkt. 395-1. The Court finds it appropriate given the \npotential challenges these particular class members (many of whom are currently incarcerated) may \n \n2 The Court also instructs the parties that pursuant to its equitable powers, the Court finds that any individuals who would \notherwise have qualified for the settlement recovery but for the delay in notice or approval resulting from the administrative \nissues described in this subsection should be deemed members of the class regardless of when their claim is ultimately \nprocessed, and are therefore entitled to their pro rata share of the settlement fund. \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 13 of 24 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 463   Filed 08/11/20   Page 14 of 24   Page ID\n#:16214\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n8/11/2020 \nCase No.  2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v.

The Court approves \nany additional claims filed prior to the final approval hearing, which was held on July 20, 2020.  \n \nV.  Conclusion \n \nThe Court GRANTS final approval to the settlement agreement proposed by the parties. It also \nadopts by reference the findings and instructions contained in the following sections of the Proposed \nOrder submitted by Plaintiffs: Section IV, Section VI, Section XII, Section XIII, and Section XIV, \nexcept to the extent they directly conflict with the terms of this Order. The parties and JND are \ninstructed to proceed with the implementation of the Settlement Agreement as written. \n \n \nMotion for Attorneyโs Fees and Costs \n \nI.  Legal Standard \n \nIn awarding attorneyโs fees under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(h), โcourts have an \nindependent obligation to ensure that the award, like the settlement itself, is reasonable.โ In re Bluetooth \nHeadset Prods. Liab. Litig., 654 F.3d at 941. In the Ninth Circuit, there are two primary methods to \ncalculate attorneyโs fees: the lodestar method and the percentage of the fund approach. Id. at 941โ42. \nUnder the percentage of the fund approach, the attorneyโs fees equal some percentage of the common \nsettlement fund; in the Ninth Circuit, the benchmark percentage is 25%. Id. at 942. The lodestar method \nrequires โmultiplying the number of hours the prevailing party reasonably expended on the litigation (as \nsupported by adequate documentation) by a reasonable hourly rate for the region and for the experience \nof the lawyer.โ Id. at 941. \n \nA district court has discretion in calculating fees, or approving a fee request, but it โabuses that \ndiscretion when it uses a mechanical or formulaic approach that results in an unreasonable reward.โ In \nre Mercury Interactive Corp. Sec. Litig., 618 F.3d 988, 992 (9th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). One way that a court may demonstrate that its use of a particular method or the amount \nawarded is reasonable is by conducting a cross-check using the other method. For example, a crosscheck \nusing the lodestar method โcan โconfirm that a percentage of recovery amount does not award counsel \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 14 of 24 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 463   Filed 08/11/20   Page 15 of 24   Page ID\n#:16215\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n8/11/2020 \nCase No.  2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v.

Litig., 55 F.3d 768, 821 n. 40 (3d Cir. 1995)). \n \nBecause the relationship between class counsel and class members turns adversarial at the fee-\nsetting stage, district courts assume a fiduciary role that requires close scrutiny of class counselโs \nrequests for fees and expenses from the common fund. Vizcaino v. Microsoft Corp., 290 F.3d 1043, \n1052 (9th Cir. 2002); see also In re Mercury Interactive Corp. Sec. Litig., 618 F.3d 988, 994 (9th Cir. \n2010) (โAs a fiduciary for the class, the district court must โact with a jealous regard to the rights of \nthose who are interested in the fund in determining what a proper fee award is.โโ (internal quotation \nmarks omitted) (quoting In re Wash.

Analysis \n \nAs is customary in large-figure class action settlements, the Court acts within its discretion to \nfirst analyze the fee request under the percentage of the fund approach, and then cross-check this \nanalysis with reference to the provided lodestar figures submitted by Class Counsel, to ensure the award \nis reasonable. See Acosta v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 2018 WL 2088278, at *11-12 (N.D. Cal. May 4, 2018); \nSmith v. Am. Greetings Corp., 2016 WL 362395, at *8-9 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 29, 2016).  \n \na.  Percentage of the Fund \n \nPlaintiffsโ motion for attorneyโs fees seeks 33.33% of the total settlement fund, for a total fee \naward of $17,490,000.00 to be paid to Class Counsel. Dkt. 409. In the Ninth Circuit, the โbenchmarkโ \nfigure for fee award analysis under the percentage of a common fund approach is 25%. See In re \nBluetooth, 654 F.3d at 942; see also In re Hyundai & Kia Fuel Econ. Litig., 926 F.3d 539, 570 (9th Cir. \n2019). However, Class Counsel argues that โnearly all common fund awards range around 30%. Dkt. \n409 at 8-9. The Court disagrees and finds that the benchmark for percentage of a common fund in the \nNinth Circuit remains 25%. See In re Easysaver Rewards Litig., 906 F.3d 747, 754 (9th Cir. 2018) \n(noting that a disputed fee award fell below the โ25% benchmark typically used in our circuitโ); In re \nHyundai, 926 F.3d at 570 (same);  \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 15 of 24 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 463   Filed 08/11/20   Page 16 of 24   Page ID\n#:16216\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n8/11/2020 \nCase No.  2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v. Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \n \nThe Ninth Circuit has indicated various factors relevant for consideration of an upwards \npercentage fee adjustment which include (1) the extent to which class counsel achieved exceptional \nresults for the class; (2) whether the case was risky for class counsel; (3) whether counselโs performance \ngenerated benefits beyond the cash settlement fund; (4) the market rate for the particular field of law; (5) \nthe burdens class counsel experienced while litigating the case; (6) and whether the case was handled on \na contingency basis and its duration. See Vizcaino v. Microsoft Corp., 290 F.3d 1043, 1048-50 (9th Cir. \n2002); see also In re Optical Disk Drive Products Antitrust Litigation, 2020 WL 2507359, at *6 (9th \nCir. May 15, 2020). \nThe Court will generally apply these factors in a manner which it believes effectively addresses \nthe relevant circumstances in this class settlement and litigation. The Court will not address Class \nCounselโs skill and experience (which it finds are more properly analyzed in justifying the lodestar \ncross-check by establishing an appropriate rate for services rendered) or the reaction of the class (which \nthe Court finds relevant only to the final approval decision analyzed above). The Court agrees with \nClass Counsel that the โcomplexity of the litigationโ rather than its โriskinessโ for Class Counsel better \ndescribes that relevant factor. See Dkt. 409 at 3. Because the Ninth Circuit has repeatedly emphasized \nthat these factors are not โexhaustive,โ the Court also acts within its discretion to consider other factors \nmore unique to this lawsuit. See In re Optical Disk Drive, 959 F.3d at 930 (โUltimately, district courts \nmust ensure their fee awards are supported by findings that take into account all of the circumstances of \nthe caseโ) (quotations omitted). \ni.  Exceptional Result Achieved \n \nClass Counsel argues that the result embodied in this settlement is โexceptional,โ and strongly \njustifies an upwards adjustment to the 25% benchmark. Dkt. 409 at 9-10. In support of this argument, \nClass Counsel provides in its supporting declaration a survey of strip search settlements exceeding $25 \nmillion, and asserts that the $53 million figure in this settlement is an โexceptionalโ result. See Dkt. 409 \nat 9; Dkt. 410 at 28-36 (presenting and analyzing similar strip search settlements). Class Counsel also \nargues that the average claim size (estimated at $1500 at the time the motion was filed, although revised \nto $1000 by the time of the final approval hearing due to a high claims rate) also shows that this was an \nexceptional result for class members. Dkt. 409 at 10.  \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 16 of 24 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 463   Filed 08/11/20   Page 17 of 24   Page ID\n#:16217\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n8/11/2020 \nCase No.  2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v. Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \n \nThe Court agrees that this settlement represents a good result for class members, as evidenced by \nits prior Order granting final approval of the settlement. However, it does not find that it constitutes such \nan exceptional result as to justify an upwards adjustment from the 25% benchmark. Class Counsel \nemphasizes the dollar value of the settlement ($53 million) in comparison with other strip search \nsettlements. But many of these settlements were created more than a decade ago, and as a result, the \ninflation-adjusted values of those settlements are substantially different from the value of the $53 \nmillion in 2020. The Court also notes that Class Counsel is generally conscious of inflation, and in \njustifying its lodestar figure utilizes a 3% annual adjustment to compare the requested hourly fee rates to \nhistorical hourly fee rates granted in similar cases. Dkt. 410 at 76-77. Applying the same 3% adjustment \nrate to the comparison settlements presented by Class Counsel, the Court reaches the following \napproximate inflation-adjusted figures: \n \n๏ท  Williams v. Block, (2001) $47,344,000 in 2020 dollars \n๏ท  Tyson v. City of New York (2001) $87,675,000 in 2020 dollars \n๏ท  McBean v. City of New York (2006) $49,915,000 in 2020 dollars \n๏ท  Craft v. County of San Bernardino (2008) $36,356,000 in 2020 dollars \n๏ท  Young v. County of Cook (2010) $73,915,000 in 2020 dollars \n \nHaving adjusted those settlement figures for inflation, the Court finds that the $53 million settlement \nhere is a good result, but not such an exceptional result as to justify an upwards adjustment to the 25% \nbenchmark. \n \nThe Court does not find that the average size of class member recovery demonstrates that this \nsettlement constitutes an exceptional result relative to similar settlements, because average recovery \nfigures are often subject to circumstances outside the control of Class Counsel, and the claims rates for a \nsettlement can vary dramatically. For example, at the time Class Counsel filed this motion, they asserted \nthat the average claim was likely to be $1500, but as a result of a high claims rate by class members, the \naverage is now estimated to be closer to $1000 per class member. Compare Dkt. 409 at 10 with Dkt. 449 \nat 15. This illustrates the difficulties that arise from attempting to compare these large-dollar settlements \nwith large numbers of class members and unpredictable claims rates based on average claim recovery or \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 17 of 24 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 463   Filed 08/11/20   Page 18 of 24   Page ID\n#:16218\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n8/11/2020 \nCase No.  2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v. Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \ntotal class members. The Court does not find that the average size of the class member recovery here \nfavors an upwards adjustment to the 25% benchmark.  \n \nii.  Complexity of the Litigation \n \nThe Court does not believe that this factor favors an upwards adjustment to the lodestar. Class \nCounsel are specialists in this precise intersection of civil rights law and class action litigation, \nspecifically class action prisoner litigation, and many of the complexities of these lawsuits are issues \nthey are highly familiar with and have repeatedly litigated. See generally Dkt. 410 at 5-9. Class Counsel \ncite Monell issues as adding substantial complexity to this case, but the dispositive issue that this \nsettlement ultimately arose from was what LASD indisputably acknowledged was a โpolicy or \nprocedureโ of LASDโ in this Courtโs summary judgment Order for Plaintiffs, Monell is not even \nanalyzed. See generally Dkt. 361. The complexity of the ultimately unsuccessful claims Class Counsel \npursued regarding other allegations of constitutional violations (based on verbal abuse, outside viewers \npresent during searches, and cleanliness) is not relevant to analysis of this factor. See Amador v. Baca, \n299 F.R.D. 618, 626-27 (C.D. Cal. 2014); Amador v. Baca, 2014 WL 10044904, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Dec. \n18, 2014) (declining to reconsider the class certification analysis relevant to abuse, privacy, and \nsanitation subclasses).  \nThe Court recognizes that intervening Supreme Court precedent altered the legal standard \nregarding the presumed constitutionality of body cavity searches in this context. See Florence v. Bd. of \nChosen Freeholders of Cty. of Burlington, 566 U.S. 318 (2012). But it also notes that prior Ninth Circuit \nprecedent was consistent with the outcome of Florence. See Bull v. City & County of San Francisco, 595 \nF.3d 964, 975 (9th Cir. 2010). Additionally, while Florence clearly held that use of visual body cavity \n(โVCโ) searches of inmates entering the general population was permissible without reasonable \nsuspicion, it also acknowledged that โsubstantialโ evidence could show that in practice, such policies \nmay constitute an โunnecessary or unjustifiedโ response to jail security concerns. Florence, 566 U.S. at \n323, 334; see also Dkt. 361 at 7-8 (discussing the standard articulated in Bull and Florence). Class \nCounselโs efforts in discovery and in arguing for liability were therefore straightforward, although labor-\nintensive, but not especially complex. Their core argument was that the manner in which LASDโs policy \nwas applied was unreasonable given the circumstances and other feasible options available. See \ngenerally Dkt. 346 (Plaintiffsโ motion for summary judgment). The Court granted summary judgment to \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 18 of 24 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 463   Filed 08/11/20   Page 19 of 24   Page ID\n#:16219\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n8/11/2020 \nCase No.  2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v. Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \nPlaintiffs with regard to liability based on a finding that clearly feasible measures to protect class \nmembersโ privacy during VBC searches were available, that LASD was aware of these measures, and \nthat LASD had no reasonable justification for failing to do so. See Dkt. 361.  \n  The Court also finds that some of the asserted complexity of this case was the result of issues \nClass Counsel could have avoided. The decision to decertify the class made by the Court in July 2016 \nwas made upon discovering while reviewing summary judgment briefing that significant changes had \nbeen made to the VBC search procedure during the then-ongoing class period, and that injunctive relief \nwould no longer be appropriate. See Dkt. 312 at 5-6. In the briefing on summary judgment, Class \nCounsel essentially acknowledged that this relief was moot. Id. at 4 n.4 (summarizing arguments raised \nin Plaintiffโs supplemental briefing). While the Court did ultimately recertify the class, the fact that these \npolicy changes were not brought to the Courtโs attention until summary judgment briefing began in \nDecember 2015 leads the Court to find that complexities cited by Class Counsel arising from the \ndecertification do not favor a finding that the fee award requires an upwards adjustment. See Dkt. 409 at \n6 n.3 (arguing that the Courtโs decertification posed additional challenges for Class Counsel). Similarly, \na recurring theme at certain points in this litigation has been Class Counselโs enthusiasm for \nโattempt[ing[ to re-litigate matters already decided in prior orders.โ See Dkt. 312 n.3 (raising the \npossibility of sanctions for re-arguing issues regarding commonality of subclasses that had already been \ndecided). Additional effort and motion practice linked to these attempts does not demonstrate \ncomplexity supporting an upwards adjustment to the 25% benchmark. \nAs previously discussed, the contours of the legal analysis here were clearly defined by Ninth \nCircuit and Supreme Court precedent, and exclusively related to an area where Class Counsel specialize \nheavily. Class Counselโs litigation efforts did not require comprehensive analysis of disparate state law \non specific discrete issues, or a lengthy appeals process prior to settlement. See In re Anthem, Inc. Data \nBreach Litig., 2018 WL 3960068, at *13 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 17, 2018) (finding substantial complexity \nsupporting an upwards adjustment to the benchmark when class counsel addressed technical \ncybersecurity issues while asserting claims under the law of fifty different states); In re High-Tech \nEmployee Antitrust Litig., 2015 WL 5158730, at *10 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 2, 2015) (complexity favored \nupwards adjustment where class counsel was repeatedly required to defend the action on interlocutory \nand mandamus appeal). The Court finds that this factor does not support an upwards adjustment to the \n25% benchmark.  \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 19 of 24 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 463   Filed 08/11/20   Page 20 of 24   Page ID\n#:16220\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n8/11/2020 \nCase No.  2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v. Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \niii.  Burden of Litigating on Class Counsel \n \nWhile the litigation of this case lasted approximately ten years, the Court notes that it has not \nbeen actively litigated across this entire time period. First, the Court stayed the action for approximately \nsix months pending the Supreme Courtโs decision in Florence. See Dkt. 145; Dkt. 152. Following the \nJune 2017 order granting Plaintiffsโ motion for summary judgment, the Court moved the case to the \ninactive calendar pending negotiation of a settlement. Dkt. 364. The case remained on the inactive \ncalendar for approximately 2 years before the parties notified the Court of a tentative settlement \nagreement. Dkt. 384. The Court acknowledges that Class Counsel expended significant time and energy \nduring this period negotiating the settlement. See Dkt. 410 at 64-66 (describing Class Counselโs \nmediation and settlement efforts). However, it finds that following a grant of summary judgment in a ยง \n1983 case, where attorneyโs fees are granted as of right to a prevailing plaintiff, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988, the \nrisk to Class Counsel based on the contingency nature of its representation of the class was substantially \nreduced beyond that point. Accordingly, it finds that the relevant period of active litigation for purposes \nof analyzing the โburdenโ on Class Counsel is closer to seven years than to ten. \n \nClass Counsel indisputably still experienced a significant burden in the course of litigating this \ncase on a contingency fee basis for a substantial period of time. Class Counsel documents almost 9000 \nhours of billed time by attorneys, paralegals, and law clerks in the course of this litigation. See Dkt. 410 \nat 84-85 (consolidating billing by Class Counsel and staff). Class Counsel also submits itemized costs of \napproximately $369,000 incurred during the course of litigation, and not recoverable until settlement. Id. \nat 111-12; Dkt. 410-5 (additional records of costs incurred). Both the costs advanced in this litigation \nand the substantial investment of hourly work incurred by Class Counsel favor an upwards adjustment to \nthe lodestar. \n \niv.  Benefits Generated Beyond Settlement Fund \n \nThe Court finds that this factor favors Class Counselโs request for an upwards adjustment. After \nthis lawsuit was filed in 2010, LASD made substantial changes to the search policies employed at CRDF \nafter the lawsuit was filed, first in 2011 and then in 2013. LASD ceased to employ strip searches for \ninmates willing to be scanned by body scanners in 2015. Dkt. 410 at 66-68 (describing LASD policy \nchanges and emails produced in discovery referencing this lawsuit in adopting these changes).

Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \nchanges ultimately mooted the need for continuing injunctive relief in this lawsuit. See Dkt. 312 at 5. \nThe settlement agreement does not make any provision for continuing injunctive relief. See generally \nDkt. 395-1. On this basis the Court finds that Class Counsel has clearly demonstrated that their efforts \nhave generated benefits for the class beyond those contained in the settlement fund.  \n \nv.  Market Rate in this Area of the Law \n \nThe Court determines that the appropriate comparison for assessing the โmarket rateโ in this area \nof law is settlements of similar size to the $53 million settlement amount here. At slightly more than $50 \nmillion, the settlement agreement is at the lower edge of what courts have considered a โmegafund,โ \nwhich the Ninth Circuit has not yet clearly defined. See In re Optical Disk Drive, 959 F.3d at 932-33 \n(noting that the Ninth circuit has not โidentified a bright-line definition for megafundโ but that a $124.5 \nmillion fund unquestionably is one); Nitsch v. DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc., 2017 WL 2423161 \n(N.D. Cal. June 5, 2017) (defining megafunds as settlements exceeding $50 million); Craft v. Cty. of San \nBernardino, 624 F. Supp. 2d 1113, 1127 (C.D. Cal. 2008) (same); but see Newberg on Class Actions ยง \n15:81 (5th ed. 2012) (noting that โ[m]ost courts define mega-funds as those in excess of $100 millionโ). \n  Regardless of whether the settlement here should expressly be characterized as a โmegafund,โ \nthe Court follows other district courts in the Ninth Circuit in finding that a $53 million figure is \nsufficiently large to weigh in favor of a downwards adjustment to the 25% benchmark. See Rodman v. \nSafeway Inc., 2018 WL 4030558, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 23, 2018) (citing Theodore Eisenberg, Geoffrey \nMiller, & Roy Germano, Attorneys' Fees in Class Actions: 2009-2013, 92 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 937 (2017) in \nsupport of the conclusion that a $42 million settlement falls in the second-highest decile of class action \nsettlements, and favors a โslight downward adjustmentโ from the 25% benchmark); Aichele v. City of \nLos Angeles, 2015 WL 5286028, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 9, 2015) (finding that in settlements between \n$50-$100 million, โfees more commonly will be under the 25% benchmarkโ); Craft, 624 F. Supp. 2d at \n1127 (finding that settlements above $50 million are often adjusted below 25%); cf. In re Anthem, 2018 \nWL 3960068, at *11-16 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 17, 2018) (finding even when multiple factors strongly \nsupported an upwards adjustment to the 25% benchmark, a slight increase to 27% in a megafund case \nwas appropriate). The Court finds that the โmarket rateโ in class action settlements of this size in the \nNinth Circuit favors a downwards adjustment from the 25% benchmark. \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 21 of 24 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 463   Filed 08/11/20   Page 22 of 24   Page ID\n#:16222\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n8/11/2020 \nCase No.  2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v. Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \nvi.  Conclusion \n \nHaving analyzed and weighed each of the factors discussed above, the Court finds that a fee \naward at the 25% benchmark is appropriate in these circumstances. Accordingly, given the $53 million \nsettlement fund, Class Counsel is entitled to a fee award of $13,250,000. \n \nb.  Lodestar Cross-check \n \nTo confirm an award's reasonableness through a lodestar cross-check, a court takes โthe number \nof hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.โ Hensley v. \nEckhart, 461 U.S. 424, 33 (1983). โ[T]he determination of fees โshould not result in a second major \nlitigationโโ and โtrial courts need not, and indeed should not, become green-eyeshade accountants.โ Fox \nv. Vice, 563 U.S. 826, 838, (2011) (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437). Rather, the Court seeks to โdo \nrough justice, not to achieve auditing perfection.โ Id. at 838.  \nThe Court has reviewed the extensive documentation provided by Class Counsel in support of \ntheir hours billed, and the hourly rates requested. See Dkt. 410 at 81-113. The Court finds that on the \nwhole, the hours billed and rates requested are generally reasonable, but it makes certain adjustments to \nthese figures discussed below.  \nFirst, the Court finds that the lodestar figure submitted by Class Counsel is somewhat inflated by \nthe fact Ms. Battles (one of the lead attorneys in the case for Kaye McLane Bednarski and Litt LLP, and \na 2008 law school graduate) seeks an hourly rate of $700/hr for the approximately 3100 hours she \nincurred in litigating this action. Id. at 84. The Court finds that Class Counsel has adequately supported \nher billing rate given her current level of experience. See id. at 99-101. However, based on Ms. Battlesโ \nyear of graduation from law school, a very substantial fraction of her hourly billings were incurred when \nshe would not have been qualified to bill at a rate remotely close to $700/hr. See generally Dkt. 410-3 at \n124-271 (substantial fraction Ms. Battlesโ work done in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013). Because her \nhourly rate for the first couple of years of the litigation would likely have been closer to one-half to two-\nthirds the rate she now requests, the Court finds that applying a $700/hr rate across all of her billed hours \nresults in an inflated figure for her billings.  \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 22 of 24 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 463   Filed 08/11/20   Page 23 of 24   Page ID\n#:16223\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n8/11/2020 \nCase No.  2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v. Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \n  Second, the Court notes that the hourly rate requested by Mr. Litt of $1200/hr is higher than the \nmajority of even the โadjustedโ rates he presents (which contain a 3% inflation adjustment to prior year \nfee awards he has received). Id. at 89. While upwards adjustments to hourly rates are common in legal \npractice, none of the submitted fee awards for civil rights lodestars exceed $1150/hr (even for 2018 and \n2019 fee awards to Mr. Litt). Id. The Court finds that Mr. Littโs requested rate of $1200/hr is not entirely \nsupported by the evidence before the Court. \n  Finally, the Court notes that Class Counsel seeks $360/hr for work by a senior paralegal, Ms. \nWhite, who billed approximately 10% of the total hours in this case. Id. at 84. While Class Counsel \npresents adjusted fee rates based on prior awards to senior paralegals is past years that in some cases are \nclose to $360/hr (and in one case exceed it), most are significantly below that rate. The Court finds that \nthis hourly rate is also not adequately supported by Class Counselโs submitted evidence and the Courtโs \nown experience with fee awards to paralegals. \n  The Court finds that the reasons discussed above justify a moderate โhaircutโ of 10% to the total \nhourly billings by Mr. Litt, Ms. Battles, and Ms. White. See Moreno v. City of Sacramento, 534 F.3d \n1106, 1112 (9th Cir. 2008) (in lodestar calculations, a district court is permitted to impose a 10% \nโhaircutโ even without a specific explanation for the reduction). The combined billings of these three \nindividuals, at $4,306,230, are therefore reduced by $430,623. See Dkt. 450 at 5-6 (final hourly billings \nsubmitted in connection with final approval hearing). After subtracting this sum from the final lodestar \nprovided by Class Counsel of $5,709,924, the Court arrives at a final revised lodestar figure of \n$5,279,301. See id. at 85. Given the Courtโs determination that a fee award of $13,250,000 is \nappropriate via the percentage of the fund approach, the Court finds that this award is equivalent to \ngranting a lodestar multiplier of approximately 2.5x the lodestar. The Court finds this to be wholly \nreasonable, particularly in light of the data provided by Class Counselโs expert, William Rubenstein. See \nDkt. 413 at 2, 23 (finding an average lodestar multiplier of 2.2 in cases involving a common fund similar \nin size to this settlement). It is also squarely in the top-half of lodestar multipliers given in large-dollar \nclass action settlements such as this one. See Vizcaino, 290 F.3d at 1051 n.6 (finding that in the Ninth \nCircuit, multipliers generally range from one to four). \n  The Court finds that a cross-check of the lodestar multiplier against the percentage of the fund \naward supports the Courtโs finding that a 25% fee award is reasonable.   \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 23 of 24 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 463   Filed 08/11/20   Page 24 of 24   Page ID\n#:16224\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n8/11/2020 \nCase No.  2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v.

Because this \nsettlement agreement fails to achieve that primary goal, the Court is forced to DENY preliminary \napproval. \n \nI.  Introduction and Factual Background \n \nLead Plaintiffs Mary Amador et al. represent a class of female inmates of the Los Angeles \nCounty Sheriffโs Department (โLASDโ) who contend that highly invasive body cavity inspections \nconducted during the relevant class period (March 5, 2008 to January 1, 2015) violated their Fourth \nAmendment rights. Dkt. 387 pg. 1. After certification of several classes and sub-classes, Dkt. 327, this \nCourt granted Plaintiffโs Motion for Summary Judgment on June 7, 2017. Dkt. 361. Following a \nprolonged period of negotiation and mediation, the parties made this Motion for Preliminary Approval \nof Class Action Settlement. Dkt. 387.  \n \nThe full Settlement Agreement requires LASD to pay a total of $53 million dollars into a Class \nFund over a period of three years. Dkt. 387-2, pg. 3 (โthe Settlement Agreementโ). The proposed \ndistribution of funds includes: \n \n๏ท  Incentive awards to nine named plaintiffs of $10,000 each. \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 1 of 13 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 394   Filed 09/23/19   Page 2 of 13   Page ID\n #:14100\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n9/23/2019 \nCase No.  CV 10-01649 SVW  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v. Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \n๏ท  Up to $3 million in Class Funds to finance contracts between the County of Los Angeles and \nseveral private nonprofit and for-profit entities (the Moss Group and the Center for Gender \nand Justice) that seek to โdevelop a strengthened model of gender-responsive policy and \noperational practice at all LASD facilities that house female inmates.โ  \n๏ท  Third-party class settlement administration costs by the chosen administrator, JND Legal \nAdministration, estimated at up to $464,000 (dependent on the total claims rate within the \nclass). \n๏ท  A provision giving Plaintiffโs counsel the right to apply for attorneyโs fees of up to one-third \nof the Class Fund as well as litigation costs, with final approval over any award of attorneyโs \nfees at the Courtโs discretion. \n๏ท  The remainder of the Class Fund to be distributed to class members under a points-based \nallocation formula. \n \nBecause the Class includes an estimated 93,000 to 94,000 individuals, Plaintiffโs counsel \nanticipates that only 20% of the potential class will submit claims. Dkt. 387, pg. 12-13. Notice will be \nprovided through text messages, email, social networking accounts, first-class mail, notices in Prison \nLegal News, and various other methods. Dkt. 387-2, pg. 21-22. The average claim, given Plaintiffโs \npredicted claims rate, would be roughly $1500 per class member. Dkt. 387, pg. 13. \n \nThe Class Fund is non-reversionary but includes a remainder cy pres mechanism, allegedly \nintended to prevent accrual of โwindfallโ payments to class members. Id. at 6. This cy pres mechanism \nutilizes a secondary damages formula, applied solely for determination of a whether a cy pres payment \nto a non-profit organization should be made. Id. It uses a sliding scale that calculates a maximum \ndamages pool allotted to the class as a whole based on the actual claims rate after notice is mailed out to \npotential class members. Id. Defendants also have the right to withdraw from the settlement if more than \n250 class members choose to opt out of the class. Id.  \n \nII.  Legal Standard \n \nA district court holds a unique role in the approval of a class action settlement, serving as a \nfiduciary to the absent class members. See Rodriguez v. West Publishing Corp., 563 F.3d 948, 968 (9th \nCir. 2009); see also Newberg, at ยง 13:40, fn. 4.

Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \noccurs in the absence of the traditional adversarial process, and thus requires the court to โadopt the role \nof a skeptical clientโ in scrutinizing the settlement terms. Manual for Complex Litigation, Fourth, ยง \n21.61. A district court โmay not simply rubber stamp stipulated settlementsโ, even at the preliminary \napproval stage. Kakani v. Oracle Corp., 2007 WL 1793774, at *1 (N.D. Cal. June 19, 2007); see also \nEhrheart v. Verizon Wireless, 609 F.3d 590, 603 (3rd Cir. 2010).  \n \n2018 amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (โFRCPโ) have added specificity to \nthe previously murky standard for preliminary judicial approval of a class settlement. See Cotter v Lyft, \nInc., 176 F. Supp. 3d 930, 935 (N.D. Cal. 2016). In particular, FRCP Rule 23(e)(1)(B) has been \namended to clarify appropriate procedure for preliminary approval by a court, requiring a district court \nto permit notice to be given to the class (i.e. granting preliminary approval) only following a sufficient \nshowing that the court โwill likely be able toโ (1) approve the proposal under Rule 23(e)(2), and (2) \ncertify the class for the purposes of judgment.  \n \nThus, proper analysis at the preliminary approval stage requires inquiry into the same factors \nrelevant to a final approval of a class settlementโ that the settlement is โfair, reasonable, and adequateโ \nwhen considering the specific sub-factors provided in 23(e)(2). If it falls within the โrange of \nreasonablenessโ relative to each of these factors (to integrate relevant pre-amendment Ninth Circuit \ncaselaw into this analysis) the court should issue preliminary approval. Cotter v. Lyft, at 935. These sub-\nfactors include (A) adequate representation by class representatives and class counsel, (B) a proposal \nthat was negotiated at armโs length, (C) adequate relief provided to the class, and (D) that the proposal \ntreats class members equitably relative to each other. \n \nIII.  Analysis \n \nThis Court previously certified several classes and sub-classes for damages under Rule 23(c)(4) \nDkt. 327. Therefore the second requirement of 23(e)(1)(b), that the Court will be likely to โcertify the \nclass for purposes of judgment on the proposal,โ has already been satisfied by the prior course of \nproceedings. Therefore, the only live issue for analysis here is whether the Court determines that given \nthese proposed terms, it is also likely to approve the final class settlement under 23(e)(2). \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 3 of 13 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 394   Filed 09/23/19   Page 4 of 13   Page ID\n #:14102\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n9/23/2019 \nCase No.  CV 10-01649 SVW  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v. Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \na.  Adequate representation by class counsel and class representatives. \n \nโAdequate representationโ for purposes of Rule 23(e)(2)(A) generally focuses inquiry on the \nnature and amount of discovery, as well as the overall performance of counsel representing the class \nduring the course of litigation. Newberg, at ยง 13:49.  \n \nKaye, McLane, Bednarski & Litt, LLP (โClass Counselโ) has represented this class since 2010 \nand litigated vigorously in the years since, winning class certification and a Motion for Summary \nJudgment in the process. Dkt. 327, Dkt. 261. Class Counsel has litigated public interest and civil rights \ncases since 1984 and has specialized in civil rights class actions, including several specifically tied to \nstrip search constitutional violations. Dkt. 388, Declaration of Barrett Litt, ยถยถ 2-3, 13. Class Counsel has \nperformed extensive discovery, deposed a variety of LASD personnel, and settlement discussions began \nin this case only after multiple rounds of certification and decertification with regard to injunctive and \ndamages relief. Id. at ยถ 5. Class Counsel also devoted significant effort to contacting potential class \nmembers immediately prior to reaching settlement agreement with Defendants in order to ensure an \nadequate claims rate and to provide leverage for an alternative piecemeal litigation strategy if settlement \ntalks break down. Id. at ยถ 16. \n \nOn this record and given the wider range of latitude afforded this analysis for preliminary \napproval, the Court finds no issue with adequate representation of either counsel or class representatives \nthat would bar preliminary approval. \n \nb.  Proposed settlement negotiated at armโs length. \n \nRule 23(e)(2)(B) directs inquiry at the relationship between the parties in order to root out \npotentially collusive settlements that benefit the plaintiffsโ lawyers at the classโs expense. Newberg, at ยง \n13:50. Ninth Circuit district courts (prior to the 2018 amendment to the rules) generally gave an โinitial \npresumption of fairnessโ to settlements negotiated at armโs length. Corson v. Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., \nInc., 2016 WL 1375838, at *7 (C.D. Cal. April 4, 2016); Mora v. Cal West Ag Services, Inc., 2018 WL \n3201764, at *8 (E.D. Cal. 2018). \n \nThe parties reached a settlement agreement here following three full days of in-person settlement \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 4 of 13 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 394   Filed 09/23/19   Page 5 of 13   Page ID\n #:14103\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n9/23/2019 \nCase No.  CV 10-01649 SVW  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v. Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \nconferences before the Hon. George H. King (Ret.). Id. at 3. As discussed above, these settlement \nnegotiations followed a lengthy litigation process prior to the Summary Judgment order by this Court \nthat prompted settlement negotiations. Given Class Counselโs experience, use of an impartial mediator, \nand very substantial pre-settlement litigation, the Court views this element as sufficiently satisfied for \npurposes of preliminary approval.  \n \nc.  Relief provided for the class is adequate \n \nRule 23(e)(2)(C)โs requirement of adequate relief directs a court to consider, (i) the costs, risks, \nand delay of trial and appeal; (ii) the effectiveness of any proposed method of distributing relief to the \nclass, including the method of processing class-member claims; (iii) the terms of any proposed award of \nattorney's fees, including timing of payment; and (iv) any agreement required to be identified under Rule \n23(e)(3). The Advisory Committee notes to Rule 23 recommend forecasting the likely range of class-\nwide recoveries and comparing these results to the settlement figure. FRCP 23(e)(2) n. 2018. The Ninth \nCircuit has directed inquiry on this factor towards whether โthe settlement taken as a wholeโ \ndemonstrates that the classโs interests drove the ultimate outcome of negotiations. Staton v. Boeing Co., \n327 F.3d 938, 960 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1027 (9th Cir. \n1998)). \n \nAt this preliminary stage, the Court is not yet required to rule on any proposed award of \nattorneyโs fees and no โside agreementsโ under Rule 23(e)(3) have been identified within the full \nSettlement Agreement provided to the Court. Dkt. 387-2. Thus elements (iii) and (iv) are not relevant \nhere to the Courtโs analysis at the preliminary approval stage.  \n \nThe settlement agreement calls for a $53 million settlement split between nearly 100,000 \npotential class members (after costs and attorneyโs fees). Dkt. 387. Class Counsel cites in its declarations \nto a variety of class action settlement with roughly comparable facts and class sizes, which resulted in \nsettlements ranging from $55 million to $33 million, although actual payout rates were far lower in \nsome cases. Dkt. 388, Litt Declaration, pg. 5. Class Counsel also contends that the estimated dollar \nfigure per-claim, $1500, would be at the โhigh endโ of strip search class recoveries. Id. at 4. \n \nClass Counsel acknowledges that while individual members of the class might possibly win five \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 5 of 13 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 394   Filed 09/23/19   Page 6 of 13   Page ID\n #:14104\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n9/23/2019 \nCase No.  CV 10-01649 SVW  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v. Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \nor even six figure judgments in individual actions, this Courtโs prior ruling certifying the subclasses \nunder Rule 23(c)(4) precluded class-wide damages calculations, meaning recovery would otherwise be \nlargely limited by class memberโs ability and willingness to mount individualized trials on damages. \nDkt. 327, pg. 8. Additionally, the โopt-outโ provision described above and detailed in the full settlement \norder would permit individual members with strong claims to pursue greater compensation through \nindividual jury trials on damages. Dkt. 387-2, pg. 7. Finally, Supreme Court precedent during the course \nof this litigation has pared back constitutional claims regarding jail strip searches generally, restricting \nthe range of continued litigation in this area. Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of Cty. of \nBurlington, 566 U.S. 318, 341, (2012). \n \nGiven the size of the class here, the average recovery, and the ability of up to 250 class members \nwith more substantial claims to opt-out of the settlement, the Court would generally be inclined to \napprove the broad terms of the settlement. However, the proposal to earmark up to $3 million of the \nsettlement to contracts between private parties and Los Angeles County, thereby reducing the recovery \nof each member of the class, creates grave concerns for this Court which prevent it from granting \npreliminary approval of the settlement. \n \ni.  If the $3 million payment is cy pres, it is an unprecedent use of such a \nmechanism. \n \nCy pres is a medieval equitable doctrine that has evolved in the modern era into the primary \nmethod for disposing of unclaimed class action funds, on logic that this constitutes a โnext bestโ use of \nfunds through an indirect benefit realized by charitable action. Newberg, at ยง 12:32. In more \ncontroversial cases, courts have approved โfullโ cy pres charitable distributions (without any distribution \ndirectly to class members) in contexts where the classes are vast and injuries comparatively small, such \nthat attempted distribution be cost-prohibitive.1 Newberg, at ยง 12:26 fn. 16 (collecting cases). In \njustifying use of cy pres, courts have emphasized the advantage of indirect benefit conferred by \ncharitable action enabled by funds as an alternative to making additional โwindfallโ payments to class \n                                                 \n1 Classically considered appropriate in contexts where the postage required to mail a settlement check would exceed the per-\nmember recovery. Nachshin v. AOL, LLC, 663 F.3d 1034, 1037 (9th Cir. 2011). Cf. Mirfasihi v. Fleet Mortg. Corp., 356 F.3d \n781, 784 (7th Cir. 2004) (rejecting the parties' contention that \"each member would receive an amount smaller than the cost \nof postage\"). \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 6 of 13 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 394   Filed 09/23/19   Page 7 of 13   Page ID\n #:14105\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n9/23/2019 \nCase No.  CV 10-01649 SVW  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v.

Kore of Indiana \nEnterprise, Inc., 731 F.3d 672, 676 (7th Cir. 2013).โ \n \nAlternatives to cy pres exist, primarily pro rata distribution of unclaimed funds to existing class \nmembers who submitted claims. The American Law Institute (ALI) issued a 2010 report taking the \nposition that class settlement should โpresumptively provide for further distributions to participating \nclass members unless the amounts involved are too small to make individual distributions economically \nviable or other specific reasons exist that would make such further distributions impossible or unfair.โ \nNewberg, at ยง 12:30 (quoting American Law Institute, Principles of the Law of Aggregate Litigation ยง \n3.07, cmt. b (2010)).  \n \nThe Ninth Circuit has approved of cy pres for both unclaimed funds and full cy pres distribution \nto charities. In re Easysaver Rewards Litigation, 906 F.3d 747, 760 (9th Cir. 2018); Nachsin v. AOL, \nLLC, 663 F.3d 1034, 1037 (9th Cir. 2011); Six (6) Mexican Workers v.

Review of a cy \npres remedy included in a class action requires that the remedy โaccount[s] for the nature of the \nplaintiffs' lawsuit, the objectives of the underlying statutes, and the interests of the silent class \nmembers....โ Nachsin, at 1036. But endorsement of traditional cy pres in the Ninth Circuit has generally \nfocused on class settlements where the harm to class members was generally fully reimbursed for any \nclaimants, and thus additional recovery could plausibly be considered a โwindfallโ to participating \nmembers. Easysaver, at 761.  \n \nHere, the settlement agreement does not expressly label the $2-$3 million in planned contracts \nthe Moss Group and the Center for Gender and Justice as cy pres, unlike the proposed remainder cy pres \nprovision that mandates payments to an unnamed nonprofit in the event of a low claims rate. Dkt. 387-2, \npp. 3, 18. However it does label this payment as โindirect compensation to absent class membersโ, \nlanguage evocative of the purpose behind a cy pres mechanism in most cases. Id. at 3. In addition, these \ncontractual payments are intended โto help develop a strengthened model of gender-responsive policy \nand operational practice at all LASD facilities that house female inmates (including CRDF and Twin \nTowers), while enhancing the culture of safety and respect for both staff and the inmate population.โ Id. \nUnder the Ninth Circuit standard, this would appear to suggest intent to have the payments treated as cy \npres, given the nature of plaintiffโs lawsuit and the goal of encouraging respectful, safe practices by \n \n \n \n     \n  :   \n   \nInitials of Preparer                  \nPMC \n \n \n  CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL  Page 7 of 13 \n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 394   Filed 09/23/19   Page 8 of 13   Page ID\n #:14106\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL \n     \n9/23/2019 \nCase No.  CV 10-01649 SVW  Date \n \nMary Amador, et al., v.

This represents a substantial extension of the traditional use of the cy pres mechanism, \none that the Court does not feel is justified in these circumstances. \n \n  Moreover, this Court believes that the Ninth Circuitโs approval of cy pres in โwindfallโ cases is \nclearly distinguishable from the facts of this settlement. Every member of this class has had their \nconstitutional rights violated on at least one occasion, and it is unclear that any dollar amount, much less \nan additional $3 million split between thousands of class members, could plausibly constitute a \nโwindfall.โ More concretely, cases like In re Easysaver involved consumer classes, where damages \ncould be readily calculated and participating class members had truly been fully compensated. Id. at 761. \nSimilarly, full charitable cy pres in scenarios with small settlement figures and enormous classes are a \nfar cry from this proposed settlement, which has a minimum recovery of $200, easily justifying the \nexpense of full distribution. Dkt. 387-2, pg. 13.  \n \n  To the extent that these payments are considered cy pres, the Court finds reduction of the Class \nFund in advance of any distribution to claiming class members to be unfair to members of the class, and \naccordingly it cannot constitute โadequate reliefโ for purposes of preliminary approval under Rule \n23(e)(1)(B) and (e)(2). Thus, preliminary approval on the basis that this Court is โlikelyโ to issue final \napproval on these terms is impossible. \n \nii.  If the $3 million is not cy pres, it represents a reduction in recovery to the \nclass members to combat issues that both sides claim have already been \nabated. \n \nAt an earlier time in this caseโs history, the Plaintiffs included a claim for injunctive relief to \nimprove the conditions in which the strip searches were conducted. Dkt. 387, fn. 2. In 2015, LASD \nadded privacy curtains and body scanners to the search area, and Plaintiffs dropped their claim for \ninjunctive relief. Id.

Plaintiffs \ncan bring an additional suit regarding current policies implemented by LASD. LASD itself can seek \nadditional funds from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, perhaps as part of their recent \ninitiative addressing โBuilding a Gender-Responsive Criminal Justice System.โ Dkt. 387, pg. 4. Either \nof those solutions could be accomplished without shortchanging recovery of this class for constitutional \nviolations in order to enact these future policy changes. \n \nThe Parties might argue that these payments do not constitute cy pres, but instead are a \nnonmonetary form of compensation made to all class members. Indeed, at the August 19, 2019 motion \nhearing regarding preliminary approval, the Parties indicate that these payments were primarily intended \nto benefit absent class members who were not able to participate in the recovery and are statistically \nmore likely than the population as a whole to enter LASD custody in the future. The Court is \nunconvinced that such benefits stemming from improvements in future LASD policing conduct are \nsufficiently connected to this class collectively to justify reducing the overall Class Fund by almost 10% \n(given the calculations described in the Settlement Agreement) after attorneyโs fees and costs are \ndeducted. Dkt. 387-2, pp. 7-8. \n \nAs above, even if these payments do not constitute cy pres, the Court concludes that the \nsettlement agreement as presented does not give โadequate reliefโ to class members, and thus cannot \ngive preliminary approval to the settlement as proposed. \n \niii.  The proposed remainder cy pres mechanism is unlikely to be utilized but may \npresent a future challenge to final approval.  \n \nAs referenced above, the settlement agreement has an additional cy pres mechanism that only \ntakes effect if the claims rate by class members is very low. Dkt. 387-2, pp. 17-18. These calculations \nare dependent on the distribution of claimants with regard to the number of searches they experienced \nwhile in LASD custody during the Class Period. Id.

Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \n \n \n  Under the remainder calculation, each claim submitted will be allotted a $5k-$20k figure based \non the total number of searches endured by each class member. Id. Then, the final Class Fund will have \nthe total dollar figure of all actual claims submitted under this calculation formula deducted from it, and \nany remainder will be donated to a nonprofit to be specified in the future. Id. The stated purpose of this \nadditional cy pres mechanism is to ensure Class Members โdo not receive a windfallโ in the event of an \nunusually low claims rate.2 \n \n  Because the formula incorporates a relatively high claim maximum for even single searches, a \nremainder cy pres distribution to charity is unlikely unless the claims rate is much lower than predicted. \nTo borrow an example from the Settlement Agreement, if only 4,000 class members submit claims (a \nclaims rate of less than 5%) and the average claim is given a value of $9,000 (meaning that the majority \nof claims are by class members with 1-3 or 4-6 claimed searches), the Class total under the formula \nwould equal $36 million and no cy pres payment would be made. Id. at 18. \n \n  Class Counsel stated in their declaration that they anticipate a claims rate of approximately 20% \nbased on their experience in prior strip search class action settlements. Litt Declaration, ยถ 9. Given Class \nCounselโs substantial experience in this area, and their declaration under penalty of perjury to this effect, \nthe Court takes the view that the actual claims rate will be at least reasonably close to their estimate. To \n                                                 \n2 It should be noted however that although the cy pres formula operates as a โcapโ to the extent that it governs how much of \nthe Class Fund is actually distributed to Class Members as a whole, it does not actually govern individual claim values. \nInstead, the more complicated points-based formula based on the dates of LASD searches (intended to correspond to the \ninvasiveness of the searches at different points in time) would be used to allocate pro rata shares of the final Class Fund.

Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \nillustrate how low the claims rate would have to be for the cy pres remainder formula to take effect, if \nClass Counsel was off by 50% (i.e. a claims rate of 10% rather than 20%) and each claimant fell into the \nlowest possible category (1-3 searches), the formula would still result in no additional cy pres \ndistribution because the class would total ~$47 million in claims. Class Counselโs estimate would have \nto be off very substantially (below 6-7% rather than 20%), and all claims would need to be in the lowest \npossible category to present the possibility of a substantial cy pres distribution to a future nonprofit. \n \n  On similar logic to the analysis above in parts (i) and (ii), this Court is inclined to think that any \ncy pres distribution intended to prevent windfall payments is wholly inappropriate in the context of a \nclass consisting of individuals who have suffered constitutional violations. It is not clear to the Court \nthat a payment of even $5000 to an individual who has suffered an invasive body cavity search in public \nview could rightly be considered a โwindfallโ. Thus, if the effect of this provision was to deprive the \nclass members of a substantial portion of the Class Fund because the claims rate was unexpectedly quite \nlow, the Court would be unlikely to approve such a settlement. \n \n  However, it appears likely given Class Counselโs declaration and experience that the claims rate \nwill not be so low, and the preliminary approval standard only requires the Court to determine that it is \nโlikely toโ grant final approval under Rule 23(e)(2). In addition, Class Counsel note that they have been \nin pre-settlement contact with hundreds of class members who experienced many unconstitutional strip \nsearches, increasing the likelihood that a substantial portion of total claimants will fall into the highest \n($20,000) bracket for remainder cy pres calculation purposes. Dkt. 388, pg. 6. Because the Court deems \nthe claims rate likely to exceed that necessary to avoid a remainder cy pres distribution, it does not find \nit necessary to deny preliminary approval on this basis. However, it does reserve the right upon motion \nfor final approval, to review the actual claims rate and the actual distribution of the Class Fund under the \nsame โfair, reasonable, and adequateโ standard.  \n \nd.  Proposal treats class members equitably. \n \nAnalysis of the intra-class equity of a proposed class settlement under Rule 23(e)(2) requires \ninquiry into how class members are treated relative to differences in their claims, any incentive \npayments made to lead plaintiffs, and how the scope of release granted by the settlement affects \ndifferent categories of class members.

Sheriff Leroy D. Baca, etc., et al., \nTitle \n \n \nCourts in the Ninth Circuit have generally closely scrutinized settlement agreements that treat class \nmembers disparately. Ferrington v. McAfee, Inc., 2012 WL 1156399, at *8 (N.D. Cal. 2012); Hanlon v. \nChrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1027 (9th Cir. 1998). \n \nIncentive payments of $10,000 to $25,000 for lead plaintiffs in multi-million dollar class \nsettlements have been summarily approved in a variety of cases. Glass v. UBS Fin. Servs., Inc., 2007 \nWL 221862, at *16 (N.D. Cal. Jan.26, 2007) (approving payments of $25,000 to each named plaintiff); \nIn re: Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Antitrust Litig., No. 1917, 2016 WL 153265, at *2โ3 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 13, \n2016) ($25,000 for each of ten class representatives in $127.45 million settlement); Chu v. Wells Fargo \nInvestments, LLC, 2011 WL 672645, *5 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 16, 2011) ($10,000 to two plaintiff \nrepresentatives involved in case for five years and $4,000 to three representative plaintiffs participating \nin case for two years, from a $6.9 million settlement fund). \n \nHere, the points-based distribution formula means that class members will have differing \nrecoveries, but the formula will be applied neutrally and has a clear rationale. The distribution formula \ndeveloped in the course of mediation by the Parties is based on the changing conditions and level of \nprivacy across the multi-year class period. Dkt. 387-2, pg. 10. It gives increasing point totals for \nsearches endured under worse conditions during earlier periods in the class. Id. at 11. Beyond the sliding \nscale for invasiveness of searches, class members also receive proportionate recoveries based on the \ntotal number of searches they have endured because their recovery is based on their proportionate share \nof the total points awarded to the class. Id. Given that this Court previously determined that each search \nduring the period constituted a discrete constitutional violation, the Court finds it likely at this \npreliminary stage that the distribution formula constitutes a reasonable approximation of elative \ndamages of for class members across the different periods available. \n \nThe settlement agreement calls for incentive payments of $10,000 to nine different lead \nplaintiffs, for a total of $90,000. These payments, individually and in total, are appropriate given the \noverall settlement of $53 million. As the Parties note, the need for lead plaintiffs in custody to request \nprior injunctive relief, to represent individual subclasses created by this Court, and the need for lead \nplaintiffs to disclose intimate details to support their claims all support the reasonableness of incentive \npayments and the total number of lead plaintiffs, which are not disproportionate given an expected \naverage claim of $1500 for unnamed class members.

INTRODUCTION\n19 Plaintiffsโ Second Amended Complaint (โSACโ) seeks injunctive relief and\n20 monetary damages for allegedly unconstitutional strip search procedures at\n21 defendantsโ Century Regional Detention Facility (โCRDFโ) in Lynwood,\n22 California.  (Dkt. 109.)  Plaintiffs move for certification of an injunctive relief\n23 class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) of all โpresent or future\n24 women inmates of the LA County Jail who, upon their admission or return to\n25 CRDF from outside of CRDF, are being or will be strip/visual body cavity\n26 searched in a group, with other inmates, in an outside bus stall.โ  Plaintiffs also\n27 request certification of a similarly defined damages class under Rule 23(b)(3) of\n28 all women who have been subjected to this strip-search procedure.\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 2 of 34   Page ID #:4714\n1 II. LEGAL STANDARD\n2 โ[A]n essential prerequisite of an action under Rule 23 is that there must be\n3 a โclassโ.โ  Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal\n4 Practice and Procedure  ยง 1760, at 134 (3d ed. 2005).  โA class definition should\n5 be precise, objective, and presently ascertainable.โ  OโConnor v. Boeing N. Am.,\n6 Inc., 184 F.R.D. 311, 319 (C.D. Cal. 1998) (citation and internal quotation marks\n7 omitted); accord Keegan v. Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc., 284 F.R.D. 504 (C.D. Cal.\n8 2012).  However, โthe class does not have to be so ascertainable that every\n9 member can be identified at the commencement of the action.โ  Wright, Miller &\n10 Kane ยง 1760, at 136.  Rather, โ[i]f the general outlines of the membership of the\n11 class are determinable at the outset of the litigation, a class will be deemed to\n12 exist.โ  Id. at 136-37.  A class is โsufficiently defined and ascertainable if it is\n13 administratively feasible for the court to determine whether a particular individual\n14 is a member.โ  Keegan, 284 F.R.D. at 521 (citation and internal quotation marks\n15 omitted).\n16 To obtain certification of their proposed classes, plaintiffs bear the burden\n17 of establishing each of the four requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n18 23(a), together with at least one of the requirements of Rule 23(b).  Ellis v. Costco\n19 Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, 979-80 (9th Cir. 2011).\n20 The four Rule 23(a) requirements are numerosity, commonality, typicality,\n21 and adequacy, i.e., (1) the class is so large that joinder of all the members under\n22 Rule 19 is impracticable; (2) there are one or more questions of law or fact\n23 common to the class; (3) the named partiesโ claims are typical of the class; and (4)\n24 the class representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of other\n25 members of the class.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a); Ellis, 657 F.3d at 980.  The Court\n26 must perform โa rigorous analysis [to ensure] that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a)\n27 have been satisfied.โ  Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2551 (2011)\n28 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  The plaintiff must prove that the\n2\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 3 of 34   Page ID #:4715\n1 proposed class presents common questions of law or fact.  Id. at 2550-51.  In other\n2 words, the class membersโ claims โmust depend upon a common contention . . . of\n3 such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution โ which means that\n4 determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the\n5 validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.โ  Id. at 2551.\n6 Plaintiffs seek certification of an injunctive relief class and a damages class. \n7 An action for classwide injunctive relief is authorized by Rule 23(b)(2) if โthe\n8 party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply\n9 generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory\n10 relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \n11 Certification of a subsection (b)(2) class โis appropriate only where the primary\n12 relief sought is declaratory or injunctive.โ  Zinser v. Accufix Research Inst., Inc.,\n13 253 F.3d 1180, 1195 (9th Cir. 2001), amended by 273 F.3d 1266 (9th Cir. 2001). \n14 Certification of a damages class under subsection (b)(3) requires a different\n15 analysis.  The plaintiffs must establish that (1) โquestions of law or fact common\n16 to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual\n17 members,โ and (2) โa class action is superior to other available methods for fairly\n18 and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).\n19 III. DISCUSSION\n20 A. Class Definition\n21 Plaintiffs propose a damages class of โwomen in the custody of LA County\n22 Jail who, upon their admission or return to CRDF from outside of CRDF, until the\n23 time the practice stops or a date set for the verdict cutoff in this case, were\n24 strip/visual body cavity searched in a group, with other inmates, in an outside bus\n25 stall.โ  (Dkt 193 at 2.)  They propose a similarly defined class for the injunctive\n26 relief claim.  These are clearly defined and readily ascertainable classes.  It is\n27 undisputed that membership in the damages class can be determined from CRDF\n28 prison records.  Cf. Keegan, 284 F.R.D. at 521-22 (class was ascertainable where\n3\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 4 of 34   Page ID #:4716\n1 membership could be verified by readily available documentation).\n2 B. Rule 23(a) Requirements\n3 Plaintiffs have the burden of demonstrating that their proposed classes meet\n4 Rule 23(a)โs four requirements of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and\n5 adequacy.  Zinser, 253 F.3d at 1186.  Defendants do not dispute numerosity.  They\n6 dispute the adequacy of the named plaintiffs to represent the proposed injunctive\n7 class, but do not dispute the adequacy of the proposed representatives of the\n8 damages class.  Defendantsโ main argument against certifying both classes is that\n9 plaintiffs have not demonstrated that there is a โcommon question of law or factโ\n10 sufficient to satisfy Rule 23(a)โs commonality and typicality requirements.\n11 1. Commonality & Typicality\n12 Plaintiffs assert that the common question of law or fact in this case is\n13 โwhether Defendants had a custom, pattern and practice of routinely strip\n14 searching inmates returning from outside the jail under unconstitutional\n15 conditions.โ  (Dkt 207:  Reply at 12.)  However, โit is insufficient to merely allege\n16 any common question . . . .โ Ellis, 657 F.3d at 981; Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2251\n17 (โ[A]ny competently crafted class complaint literally raises common questions.โ)\n18 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  The concept of โunconstitutional\n19 conditionsโ potentially encompasses many disparate conditions.  โThus stated, the\n20 common question is too broad.โ  Parsons v. Ryan, 289 F.R.D. 513, 516 (D. Ariz.\n21 2013) (class of all Arizona prisoners receiving medical care proposed common\n22 question to be โwhether Defendants are deliberately indifferent to their health and\n23 safety in violation of the Eighth Amendmentโ).\n24 Wal-Mart established that simply formulating a common question is not\n25 enough to satisfy Rule 23(a).

(emphasis added, citation and internal quotation\n28 marks omitted).  The fact that the class members may have โall suffered a violation\n4\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 5 of 34   Page ID #:4717\n1 of the same provision of lawโ โ such as the Fourth Amendment right to be free of\n2 unreasonable searches or the Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel or\n3 unusual punishments โ does not necessarily mean that all the class membersโ\n4 claims โdepend upon a common contention . . . of such a nature that it is capable\n5 of classwide resolution . . . .โ  Id.  Different strip searches could violate the Fourth\n6 Amendment in different ways.  Cf. id. at 2551 (Title VII โcan be violated in many\n7 ways . . . [so] the mere claim by employees of the same company that they have\n8 suffered a Title VII injury . . . gives no cause to believe that all their claims can\n9 productively be litigated at once.โ).  Nevertheless, not all questions of fact and law\n10 must be common to satisfy Rule 23(a)(2).  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d\n11 1011, 1019 (9th Cir. 1998).  โThe existence of shared legal issues with divergent\n12 factual predicates is sufficient, as is a common core of salient facts coupled with\n13 disparate legal remedies within the class.โ  Id.(emphasis added); accord Meyer v.\n14 Portfolio Recovery Assocs, 707 F.3d 1036, 1041-42 (9th Cir. 2012) (reiterating\n15 Hanlon in light of Wal-Mart), cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 2361 (2013).\n16 Wal-Mart makes clear, however, that whatever divergent factual predicates\n17 may underlie individual class membersโ claims must be sufficiently similar that\n18 โ[t]he common contention must be โcapable of classwide resolution โ which\n19 means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central\n20 to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.โโ  Meyer, 707 F.3d at 1041-\n21 42 (quoting Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551).  โWhat matters to class certification is\n22 not the raising of common questions โ even in droves โ but, rather the capacity\n23 of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution\n24 of the litigation.โ  Wang v. Chinese Daily News, Inc., 737 F.3d 538, 543 (9th Cir.\n25 2013) (quoting Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2251).  Accordingly, when considering a\n26 motion for class certification, the Court must โโdetermine whether there was a\n27 common pattern and practice that could affect the class as a whole.โโ Id. at 544\n28 (quoting Ellis, 657 F.3d at 983).  In the present case, that question is whether the\n5\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 6 of 34   Page ID #:4718\n1 conditions experienced by all the class members during the strip searches were\n2 substantially the same, so that the issue of the constitutionality of these conditions\n3 can be resolved โin one stroke.โ  Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551.\n4 Assessing commonality frequently requires an examination of the merits of\n5 a plaintiffโs claims.  Id, at 2551-52; Ellis, 657 F.3d at 981-82.  Here, the issue of\n6 commonality and typicality overlaps with plaintiffsโ claims about the manner in\n7 which new or returning inmates were strip searched at CRDF.  Wal-Mart\n8 described two ways in which a plaintiff might be able to establish that her own\n9 injury from a defendantโs behavior is shared by โโa class of persons who have\n10 suffered the same injury.โโ  Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2553 (quoting General Tel.\n11 Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157-58 (1982)).  First, if the defendant\n12 routinely applied a particular procedure to every potential class member, then the\n13 legality of that procedure would present a common question under Rule 23(a). \n14 Second, in the absence of a routine procedure, a plaintiff can establish\n15 commonality by presenting โsignificant proofโ that the defendant behaved in\n16 accordance with a โgeneral policyโ that was illegal.  Id.  Regardless of the method\n17 of proof employed, โ[i]f there is no evidence that the entire class was subject to the\n18 same allegedly [unlawful practice or policy], there is no question common to the\n19 class.โ  Ellis, 657 F.3d at 983.\n20 As described below, there is substantial evidence that all strip searches as\n21 CRDF are conducted according to a standard procedure under conditions that in\n22 many respects are the same for all inmates, while at the same time there are\n23 numerous variations in individual inmatesโ experiences of being strip searched. \n24 Thus, commonality has been established as to some of the conditions that plaintiffs\n25 claim contribute to the unconstitutionality of the manner in which the strip\n26 searches are performed, but it has not been established as to all of the purportedly\n27 relevant conditions.\n28\n6\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 7 of 34   Page ID #:4719\n1 (a) Common Conditions During Strip Searches\n2 Many aspects of the strip search are undisputed.  Women who enter and exit\n3 CRDF are strip searched in Bus Bay 3, at least when the temperature in the area is\n4 above 68 degrees Fahrenheit.  Buses carrying inmates enter the bay through a\n5 metal garage door that is rolled down while the searches are performed.  However,\n6 the wall opposite this garage door is shared with CRDFโs reception center; a large\n7 mechanical door provides access between Bus Bay 3 and the reception center. \n8 During strip searches, this door often remains open, blocked only by large laundry\n9 carts.  Instead of a roof, the top of the bay is a chain link fence that is currently\n10 covered by a tarp.  One side of the bay is cinderblock; the other side is currently\n11 partially covered by wood panels (which extend high enough to block the view\n12 from the adjacent bus bay), with tarps hanging above these panels that cover a\n13 portion of the side of the bay.  The floor is porous gray cement.\n14 There is also little dispute about the strip search procedure.  The women are\n15 strip-searched in groups of up to sixty people.  They are not permitted to speak\n16 during the searches unless instructed to.  They are told not to look in any direction\n17 except forward.  At the beginning of each strip search, a group of fully clothed\n18 inmates is escorted in a straight line into Bus Bay 3 and told to stand with their left\n19 shoulders against the cinderblock wall.  They are then told to face the wall, and\n20 stand โshoulder to shoulder.โ1  Inmates are instructed to place any personal\n21 belongings that they have on their person โ e.g., court papers and toiletries โ in\n22 their hands behind their backs.  Deputies then search this property for contraband\n23 and place it on the floor behind each inmate.  Inmates are then instructed to\n24 remove their outer garments โ shoes, socks, pants, and shirts โ and hold them\n25\n26\n1  Defendants argue that, under Los Angeles Sheriffโs Department (LASD) policy,\n27 the inmates are required to stand with space between them so that their shoulders do\nnot touch.  Plaintiffs have submitted declarations stating that inmates often stand\n28\nclose enough to touch shoulders or hips. \n7\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 8 of 34   Page ID #:4720\n1 behind their backs.  Deputies search these items for contraband and place them on\n2 the ground behind each inmate with her personal property.  Inmates are then told\n3 to lift the back of their hair, so that deputies can see their hair and neckline.\n4 Inmates are then told to turn around towards the deputies and run their\n5 fingers along the bands of their underwear and bras.  Inmates with large folds of\n6 skin or large breasts are told to lift them so that deputies can confirm that no\n7 contraband is tucked underneath.  Inmates are also told to open their mouths and\n8 roll their tongues around so that deputies can confirm that there is no contraband\n9 inside.  At this point, inmates are told to turn back towards the wall, facing away\n10 from the deputies.  They are instructed to lower their underwear to their knees. \n11 They are then required to bend over and look back through their legs, spread their\n12 body openings, and cough, so that each deputy can visually inspect their body\n13 cavities.  Next, they are ordered to reach behind their bodies and use their hands to\n14 spread apart their buttocks and their labia.  After each inmate is inspected, she is\n15 told to get dressed, gather her belongings, and stand in line with her shoulder to\n16 the wall while waiting to be escorted into CRDF. \n17 The women are instructed to line up on both sides of Bus Bay 3, so that\n18 while facing the interior, they are in plain view of each other.  Moreover, when\n19 they are told to bend over and look through their legs and manipulate their\n20 buttocks and labia, they cannot avoid seeing the women across from them doing\n21 the same thing.  Defendants do not dispute plaintiffsโ assertion that inmates are\n22 often lined up against the walls across from one another, and plaintiffs concede\n23 that this does not always occur.\n24 Nor do the parties dispute how CRDF searches menstruating women.  After\n25 all the women have stripped down to their underwear, those who are menstruating\n26 are told to raise their hands; those who do are distributed boxes containing clean\n27 sanitary napkins and told to remove the napkin from the box and place it on their\n28 pile of clothing.  Inmates must then remove their soiled tampon or pad, place it in\n8\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 9 of 34   Page ID #:4721\n1 the empty box, and throw the box on the ground or into a trash bag.  Inmates must\n2 then wait until the genital search process is complete before they may replace the\n3 soiled pad or tampon with the clean one.2  During this time, inmates often bleed on\n4 themselves or on the ground in view of the deputies and other inmates.  While it is\n5 obvious that not all members of the proposed class were subjected to a visual body\n6 cavity search while they were menstruating, these factual disparities relate more to\n7 the question of preponderance and damages under Rule 23(b)(3) than to the\n8 question of whether the defendantsโ standard protocol for conducting the searches\n9 is unconstitutional.  Cf. Mazza v. American Honda Motor Co., 666 F.3d 581, 589\n10 (9th Cir. 2012) (where different car buyers saw different advertisements,\n11 individual questions regarding materiality of omissions related to issue of\n12 preponderance under Rule 23(b)(3), not commonality under Rule 23(a)(2));\n13 Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1019 (โAll questions of fact and law need not be common to\n14 satisfy the rule.).\n15 (b) Uncommon Conditions During Strip Searches\n16 In contrast to the common procedures described above, there are several\n17 alleged conditions of the strip searches as to which plaintiffs have failed to\n18 provide significant proof that they form a part of defendantsโ routine pattern and\n19 practice.  First, plaintiffs argue that the floor of Bus Bay 3 is kept in a filthy\n20 condition โ that the floor upon which inmates must stand barefoot is covered\n21 with bodily fluids, oil spots, bird droppings, and insects.  The only proof offered in\n22 support of this contention are 168 declarations from former CRDF inmates, many\n23 of which describe the condition of the floor as โstickyโ and โscummy,โ oil-stained,\n24\n25 2  Although defendants dispute the amount of time that any woman must stand\nnaked without a tampon or sanitary napkin in place, they do not dispute that the\n26\nstrip search procedures require women to remove their pad, then bend over, and\n27 wait for a guard to inspect them as part of the entire group.  Defendants do not\ncontend that menstruating women are searched immediately after being given a\n28\nclean sanitary napkin.\n9\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 10 of 34   Page ID\n #:4722\n1 and covered with insects.  In opposition, defendants provide declarations from\n2 seven deputies who have been assigned to CRDF and are familiar with the policies\n3 and procedures in place there.  These deputies state that, after each strip search in\n4 Bus Bay 3, the entire bay is cleaned, trash is picked up, and disinfectants are\n5 applied.  They further state that the floor is bleached and sanitized with โvarious\n6 disinfectants and specialized cleaning agents that are designed to eliminate and\n7 prevent viral infestations.โ\n8 In light of these declarations, plaintiffsโ 168 declarations fall short of the\n9 โsignificant proofโ required to show that defendants had a pattern and practice of\n10 strip searching CRDF inmates on an unsanitary floor.  Plaintiffs seek to certify a\n11 class that would number โin the tens of thousands.โ  (Mot. at 22.)  Even if the class\n12 were as small as 10,000 inmates, plaintiffsโ declarations would represent just 1.7%\n13 of the class.3  Of greater significance than the ratio of declarations to class\n14 members, however, is the absence of any evidence tending to indicate that the\n15 declarations submitted in support of class certification is a statistically reliable\n16 indicator of a regular practice at CRDF.  Plaintiffs have submitted no evidence that\n17 their declarants were selected according to a statistically valid sampling procedure,\n18 and no evidence concerning the level of confidence with which extrapolations to\n19 the entire class can be drawn. Cf. Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2556 (contrasting\n20 plaintiffsโ inadequate statistical showing with case in which pattern of\n21 discrimination was shown by affidavits of 12.5% of class drawn from\n22\n23\n3  The Court does not intend to suggest that there is some threshold ratio that must\n24\nbe reached to provide โsubstantial proofโ of a common practice.  The Supreme\n25 Court did not address the contours of the โsubstantial proofโ requirement in Wal-\nMart, and did not imply that proponents of class certification must produce\n26\ndeclarations from a majority of the members of a large class, or any particular\n27 percentage of them.  See Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2556 (citing Teamsters v. United\nStates, 431 U.S. 324 (1977) as example of case in which affidavits from 12.5% of\n28\nemployees was sufficient to establish company-wide discriminatory practice).\n10\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 11 of 34   Page ID\n #:4723\n1 representative cross-section).  Moreover, not all of the declarations state that the\n2 floor was unsanitary, further undermining plaintiffsโ contention that defendants\n3 had a policy and practice of strip-searching individuals on an unsanitary floor.  Cf.\n4 id. (โEven if every single one of these accounts [in plaintiffsโ affidavits concerning\n5 235 Wal-Mart stores] is true, that would not demonstrate that the entire company\n6 [with 3,400 stores] operates under a general policy of discrimination . . . .โ)\n7 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  \n8 Similarly, plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of providing\n9 โsignificant proofโ that defendants had a pattern and practice of subjecting inmates\n10 to demeaning and abusive language during strip searches, allowing inmates to be\n11 seen by people inside the CRDF facility (including male employees), or requiring\n12 inmates to insert their fingers into their mouths after touching other body cavities. \n13 With respect to these alleged conditions of the searches, plaintiffs rely entirely on\n14 the 168 declarations.  Although approximately 75% of the declarations include\n15 these allegations, the other 25% do not.4  In contrast to this somewhat inconsistent\n16 evidence, the deputiesโ declarations state that the search process is โspecifically\n17 designed so that inmates first touch their heads and upper bodies before they touch\n18 the lower portions of their bodies,โ and written LASD policy provides that\n19 searches are โnot to be used to inflict physical stress or punishment on inmates,โ\n20 and โshall be performed in a respectful manner.โ\n21 There is significant variation among the declarations alleging that deputies\n22 used abusive or demeaning language.  Many declarations describe deputies using\n23 obscene words in the course of giving otherwise presumptively legitimate\n24\n25\n4  The Courtโs review of the 26 narrative declarations (Exs. 700-726) and the 142\n26\ndeclarations verifying questionnaires (Exs. 800-942) indicates that 121 declarants\n27 referred to the use of obscene or abusive language, 126 declarants said that people\noutside the bus bay could see in, and 121 declarants described touching their\n28\nmouths after touching other body cavities.\n11\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 12 of 34   Page ID\n #:4724\n1 commands, but do not allege that deputies made demeaning comments about\n2 inmatesโ anatomy or appearance.  (See, e.g., Ex. 702 ยถ 4 (โDuring the search,\n3 deputies are using the word โfuckโ frequently and other swear words.โ); Ex. 714\n4 ยถ 10 (โThe guards routinely gave instructions using abusive and profane\n5 language.โ); Ex. 808-003; Ex. 894-007; Ex. 911-008.)  Other declarations,\n6 however, assert not only that deputies laced their commands with profanity, but\n7 that they โlaughed [at naked inmates], making jokes about the appearance of their\n8 bodies and how the area smelled.โ  (Ex. 713 ยถ 7; see, e.g., Ex. 704 ยถยถ 25-27; Ex.\n9 717 ยถ 7; Ex. 720 ยถ 9; Ex. 723 ยถ 18; Ex. 724 ยถยถ 15-16; Ex. 726 ยถ 7.)  The deputies\n10 acknowledge that CRDF staff sometimes โuse very direct, stern statements to\n11 inmates during the search process,โ but assert they usually do so because an\n12 inmate is not following instructions, or because they need to conduct the searches\n13 quickly.  They claim that making demeaning statements during strip searches is\n14 contrary to LASD policy and โwould expose the offending employees to discipline\n15 by the Department.โ\n16 Even assuming that plaintiffsโ declarations are accurate and representative,\n17 it is evident that deputies speak to inmates in various different ways, including\n18 giving direct orders without using objectionable language, using profanity when\n19 giving otherwise legitimate commands, and making demeaning comments to\n20 specific individuals in a deliberately humilating manner.  (See Ex. 700 ยถ 29 (โI am\n21 fearful of getting a deputy who is in a bad mood.โ); Ex. 898-08 (listing seven\n22 deputies present during strip searches and claiming two of them made comments);\n23 Ex. 901-009 (โ[A]fter going in and out so often you get used to it and just comply\n24 to breeze through it without any problems from the deputies.โ); see also Ex. 700\n25 ยถ 27 (describing multiple deputies simultaneously screaming at inmates to comply\n26 with search โso that no one can hear what any of the deputies are sayingโ).  Thus,\n27 it cannot be concluded that generalized โverbal abuseโ alleged by plaintiffs forms\n28 a part of the regular conditions common to all searches at CRDF.  Cf. Gonzalez v.\n12\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 13 of 34   Page ID\n #:4725\n1 Millard Mall Services, Inc., 281 F.R.D. 455, 462 (S.D. Cal. 2012) (plaintiff\n2 employees failed to show common policy in entire company where individual\n3 plant managers exercised discretion in setting employeesโ schedules).  Moreover,\n4 determining whether deputiesโ language contributed to the unconstitutionality of\n5 the manner in which the searches were conducted could depend on whether\n6 deputies were simply swearing while barking commands or were instead aiming\n7 humiliating remarks at inmates.  Therefore, the question of whether โverbal abuseโ\n8 contributes to the unconstitutionality of the standard search procedure at CRDF\n9 does not present a โcommon contention . . . capable of classwide resolution.โ \n10 Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551.\n11 Nor have plaintiffs met their burden of providing significant proof that\n12 defendants had a pattern and practice of failing to provide accommodations to\n13 inmates with physical disabilities.  Only 24% of plaintiffsโ declarations describe\n14 failures to accommodate the needs of disabled inmates.5  In contrast, the deputiesโ\n15 declarations state that disabled inmates โare accommodated on a case by case\n16 basis, depending upon the individual abilities and needs of the inmate.โ  This is to\n17 be expected.  Cf. Nunes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 164 F.3d 1243, 1247 (9th Cir.\n18 1999) (reasonableness of disability accomodation โrequires a fact-specific,\n19 individualized inquiryโ).\n20 For these reasons, the Court finds that while there is evidence that the entire\n21 class was subject to the same allegedly unlawful practice or policy during the\n22 searches in certain respects, the entire class was not subject to the same conditions\n23 with respect to the cleanliness of the floor, verbal abuse, outside viewers, the order\n24 in which body cavities were probed, and the accommodation of disabilities.  These\n25 latter complaints do not present a โquestion common to the class.โ  Ellis, 657 F.3d\n26 at 983; cf. Jamie S. v. Milwaukee Public Schools, 668 F.3d 481, 497-98 (7th Cir.\n27\n5  Forty-one of plaintiffsโ 168 declarations described failures to accomodate women\n28\nwith disabilities.\n13\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 14 of 34   Page ID\n #:4726\n1 2012) (While the generic question of whether a school district fulfilled its\n2 obligations to accommodate disabled children โis surely a part of both childrenโs\n3 claims, it must be answered separately for each child based on individualized\n4 questions of fact and law, and the answers are unique to each childโs particular\n5 situation.โ).\n6 2. Adequacy of Representatives for Injunctive Relief Class\n7 Defendants argue that a Rule 23(b)(2) class cannot be certified because the\n8 proposed representative plaintiffs for this class (Barranca, Vigil, and Paiz) lack\n9 standing to pursue injunctive relief.  It is undisputed that these three plaintiffs\n10 were housed in CRDF at the time plaintiffs moved to amend the complaint to add\n11 their claims for injunctive relief, a motion that was granted.  (See Dkts 43, 51, 56.)\n12 Defendants argue, however, that because they are no longer housed at CRDF, they\n13 face no imminent threat of future injury from the allegedly unconstitutional search\n14 procedures, and so lack Article III standing.  This argument is foreclosed by\n15 County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44 (1992).  The Court must\n16 determine โwhether the elements of Article III standing . . . were satisfied at the\n17 time the complaint was filed.โ  Haro v. Sebelius, __ F.3d __, 2014 WL 21353, at\n18 *6 (9th Cir. Jan. 2, 2014) (citing McLaughlin, 500 U.S. at 51).  When the first\n19 amended complaint was filed, โplaintiffsโ injury was at that moment capable of\n20 being redressed through injunctive relief.โ  McLaughlin, 500 U.S. at 51.  โ[T]hat\n21 the claims of the named plaintiffs have since been rendered mootโ does not\n22 deprive the Court of jurisdiction, and does not render the proposed representatives\n23 of the injunctive relief class inadequate.  Id. at 51-52; Pitts v. Terrible Herbst, Inc.,\n24 653 F.3d 1081, 1092 (9th Cir. 2011) (โ[I]f the district court certifies the class,\n25 certification relates back to the filing of the complaint.  Once the class has been\n26 certified, the case may continue despite full satisfaction of the named plaintiffโs\n27 individual claim because [relief for] the named plaintiff fails to satisfy the\n28 demands of the class.โ)\n14\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 15 of 34   Page ID\n #:4727\n1 C. Rule 23(b) Requirements\n2 In addition to demonstrating that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been\n3 met, plaintiffs bear the burden of showing that at least one requirement of Rule\n4 23(b) has been met.  Here, plaintiffs seek certification under both Rule 23(b)(2)\n5 and Rule 23(b)(3).\n6 1. Injunctive Relief Class\n7 Under Rule 23(b)(2), a class action โmay be maintained if Rule 23(a) is\n8 satisfied and if . . . the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on\n9 grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or\n10 corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.โ \n11 Fed. R. Civ. P. 2(b)(2).  The rule was designed, among other things, โto permit the\n12 prosecution of civil rights actions.โ  Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032, 1047 (9th\n13 Cir. 1998).  โClass certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate only where the\n14 primary relief sought is declaratory or injunctive.โ  Ellis, 657 F.3d at 986 (citations\n15 and internal quotation marks omitted). \n16 Defendants do not dispute that the common procedures described above\n17 apply generally to the class.  To this extent, therefore, plaintiffs have satisfied their\n18 burden under Rule 23(b)(2).  Cf. Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1126 (9th\n19 Cir. 2010) (certification under Rule 23(b)(2) proper where the โproposed members\n20 of the class each challenge [INS] practice of prolonged detention of detainees\n21 without providing a bond hearing and seek as relief a bond hearing with the\n22 burden placed on the governmentโ); Walters, 145 F.3d at 1047 (certification under\n23 Rule 23(b)(2) proper where plaintiffs challenged constitutionality of INS\n24 procedures in document fraud cases and โ[t]he forms and procedures in question\n25 were used by the INS in document fraud cases on a nationwide basisโ). \n26 Accordingly, the Court will certify plaintiffโs proposed injunctive class and\n27 determine whether the common conditions of the strip searches conducted at\n28\n15\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 16 of 34   Page ID\n #:4728\n1 CRDF render those searches unconstitutional.6\n2 2. Damages Class\n3 To obtain certification of a class under Rule 23(b)(3), plaintiffs must\n4 demonstrate that โthe questions of law or fact common to class members\n5 predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a\n6 class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently\n7 adjudicating the controversy.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  The rule โprovides a\n8 non-exhaustive list of factors to consider in determining superiority.โ  Local Joint\n9 Exec. Bd. of Culinary/Bartender Trust Fund v. Las Vegas Sands, Inc., 244 F.3d\n10 1152, 1163 (9th Cir. 2001).  These factors are:\n11\n (A) the class membersโ interests in individually controlling the\n12 prosecution or defense of separate actions\n13 (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the\ncontroversy already begun by or against class members;\n14\n(C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the\n15 litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and\n16 (D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action.\n17 Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  Here, the principle issue is the difficulty of managing the\n18 proposed class membersโ claims for emotional damages resulting from the\n19 allegedly unconstitutional searches they experienced.\n20 The questions of law and fact common to the determination of whether\n21 defendants are liable to the proposed class members for constitutional violations,\n22 based on the shared characteristics of the searches identified above, clearly\n23 predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.  The issue of\n24\n25\n6  The common conditions are those described in Part II(B)(1)(a) of this order, and\n26\nexclude the cleanliness of the floor, deputiesโ language, whether inmates were seen\n27 from outside the bus bay, occasions in which the order in which body cavities were\nprobed departed from standard procedure, and whether inmates with disabilities\n28\nreceived reasonable accommodations.\n16\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 17 of 34   Page ID\n #:4729\n1 liability is readily resolved โin one strokeโ for the reasons just discussed in\n2 connection with the injunctive relief class.  But the proposed class membersโ\n3 claims also include damages allegedly caused by the federal constitutional\n4 violations.  (See SAC ยถยถ 104-105, 107-108, p.28.)  The Supreme Court has made\n5 clear that the value of these damages cannot be determined in the abstract, but\n6 must be based on โproof of actual injury.โ  Memphis Community School Dist. v.\n7 Stachura, 477 U.S. 299, 308 (1986).  This is because โ[t]he basic purpose of a\n8 ยง 1983 damages award should be to compensate persons for injuries caused by the\n9 deprivation of constitutional rights.โ  Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 254 (1978). \n10 โ[D]amages for violations of constitutional rights are determined according to\n11 principles derived from the common law of torts.โ  Cummings v. Connell, 402\n12 F.3d 936, 942 (9th Cir. 2005).  Thus, compensatory damages for constitutional\n13 torts โmay include not only out-of-pocket loss and other monetary harms, but also\n14 such injuries as impairment of reputation, personal humiliation, and mental\n15 anguish and suffering.โ  Stachura, 477 U.S.at 307 (citation and internal quotation\n16 marks omitted); Carey, 435 U.S. at 263-64 (recognizing possibility of emotional\n17 distress damages for constitutional torts).\n18 Defendants oppose plaintiffsโ motion to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(3)\n19 on the ground that individualized damages assessments would substantially\n20 predominate over the common question of whether the strip searches were\n21 unconstitutional.  โWhile the black letter rule is that individual damage\n22 calculations generally do not defeat a finding that common issues predominate, in\n23 particular cases, courts may examine whether individualized damage concerns are\n24 unusually pertinent or unique.โ   2 William B. Rubenstein, Newberg on Class\n25 Actions ยง 4:54, at 208-209 (5th ed. 2012).  It is no accident that this statement of\n26 the rule refers to โcalculations.โ  See Klay v. Humana, Inc., 382 F.3d 1241, 1259-\n27 60 (11th Cir. 2004) (โParticularly where damages can be computed according to\n28 some formula, statistical analysis, or other easy or essentially mechanical methods,\n17\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 18 of 34   Page ID\n #:4730\n1 the fact that damages must be calculated on an individual basis is no impediment\n2 to class certification.โ) (footnotes omitted).  In the Ninth Circuit, the rule finds its\n3 original formulation in Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F.2d 891 (9th Cir. 1975), a\n4 securities fraud case.  In affirming certification of a class of stock purchasers\n5 allegedly harmed by misrepresentations about the companyโs financial condition,\n6 the Court of Appeals observed that โ[t]he amount of damages is invariably an\n7 individual question and does not defeat class action treatment.โ  Id. at 905.  The\n8 court explained that if the plaintiffs prevailed on their claims, โthe amount of price\n9 inflation [caused by the defendantsโ misrepresentations] during the period can be\n10 charted and the process of computing individual damages will be virtually a\n11 mechanical task.โ  Id. (emphasis added).  Subsequent opinions applying the\n12 Blackie rule typically involve damages that can be calculated using a formula that\n13 mechanically produces a numerical result on the basis of a limited set of precise\n14 data for each class member.  See, e.g., Abdullah v. U.S. Security Assocs., Inc., 731\n15 F.3d 952, 966-67 (9th Cir. 2013) (Rejecting defendantโs predominance argument\n16 because โ[i]n light of [defendantโs time records], it would not be difficult to\n17 determine [defendantโs] liability to individual plaintiffs [for failure to provide\n18 meal breaks], nor would it be overly-burdensome to calculate damages.โ); Leyva v.\n19 Medline Industries Inc., 716 F.3d 510, 514 (9th Cir. 2013) (Defendantโs\n20 โcomputerized payroll and time-keeping database would enable the court to\n21 accurately calculate damages and related penalties for each claim . . . [so that]\n22 damages could feasibly and efficiently be calculated once the common liability\n23 questions are adjudicated.โ); Arthur Young & Co. v. U. S. Dist. Court, 549 F.2d\n24 686, 696 (9th Cir. 1997) (After investment fraud claims are tried, โall that will\n25 remain is to determine the amount invested and the interest bought by each\n26 claimant, then compute damages for each claimant.โ); cf. Yokoyama v. Midland\n27 Nat. Life Ins. Co., 594 F.3d 1087, 1094 (9th Cir. 2010) (โDamage calculations will\n28 doubtless have to be made under Hawaiiโs consumer protection lawsโ based on\n18\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 19 of 34   Page ID\n #:4731\n1 annuity purchasersโ ages and the financial characteristics of the annuity, but\n2 โbecause the district court interpreted Hawaii law to require subjective reliance, it\n3 [incorrectly] concluded that the damages calculation involved highly\n4 individualized and fact-specific determinations.โ)\n5 Apparently recognizing that assessing class membersโ actual damages (or\n6 โspecial damagesโ) would be a highly individualized process, plaintiffs state that\n7 they โare not proposing class wide special damages.โ  (Reply at 16.)  Instead,\n8 plaintiffs propose two alternative ways to adjudicate damages.  Their preferred\n9 solution would be award โgeneralโ or โpresumedโ damages to the class members. \n10 In the alternative, plaintiffs suggest that certification of the class could be limited\n11 to the issue of liability only, leaving individual damages determinations to\n12 subsequent proceedings.  (Reply at 36.)\n13 (a) Presumed Damages\n14 Plaintiffs appeal to โthe well-recognized rule that presumed or general\n15 damages (as opposed to special damages) may be compensated without individual\n16 inquiry.โ  (Mot. at 36.)  They argue that general damages โare a long recognized\n17 tool for compensating for a harm to dignity that is inherent in certain constitutional\n18 violations.โ  (Id.)  Plaintiffs cite as examples two district court decisions certifying\n19 damages classes for allegedly unconstitutional strip searches.  See Barnes v.\n20 District of Columbia, 278 F.R.D. 14 (D.D.C. 2011); In re Nassau County Strip\n21 Search Cases, No. 99-CV-3126 (DRH), 2008 WL 850268 (E.D.N.Y. March 27,\n22 2008).  These courts ruled that juries could hear testimony from a small subset of\n23 the class in order to determine general damages for every class member.  See\n24 Barnes, 278 F.R.D. at 20 (โBy โgeneralโ damages, the Court means the injury to\n25 human dignity that is presumed when a person is strip searched or overdetained.โ);\n26 Nassau County Cases, 2008 WL 850268, at *6 (โThere is no reason that a jury in\n27 this case, hearing the procedures used by Defendants for strip searches together\n28 with the testimony of a number of class members as to the circumstance of actual\n19\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 20 of 34   Page ID\n #:4732\n1 searches, could not determine an amount of general damages awardable to each\n2 member of the class.โ).\n3 Plaintiffs are correct that the concept of presumed damages has an ancient\n4 pedigree, but incorrect in concluding that its use is justified in class actions for\n5 ยง 1983 claims.  The common law drew a distinction between the โgeneral\n6 damagesโ and the โspecial damagesโ caused by a legal wrong.  See, e.g.,\n7 Vanderslice v. Newton, 4 N.Y. 130, 132 (1850).  โThose which necessarily result\n8 from the injury are termed general damages,โ in contrast to special damages,\n9 which โare the natural, although not the necessary result of the injury.โ  Id. \n10 Because general damages were presumed to result from the legal wrong, they did\n11 not need to be โspeciallyโ pleaded or proved.  Hogue-Kellogg Co. v. Baker, 47\n12 Cal. App. 247, 250-51 (1920).  General damages were common in defamation\n13 actions, where it was held that โa plaintiff is entitled to general damages as\n14 compensation for those injuries which the law presumes must naturally and\n15 necessarily result from [a libelous] publication.โ  New York Evening Post Co. v.\n16 Chaloner, 265 F. 204, 220 (2d Cir. 1920).\n17 More recently, however, the Supreme Court labeled the common law of\n18 defamation โan oddity of tort law, for it allows recovery of purportedly\n19 compensatory damages without evidence of actual loss.โ  Gertz v. Robert Welch,\n20 Inc., 418 U.S. 345, 349 (1974).  The Court has neither ratified nor rejected the\n21 concept of presumed damages in ยง 1983 actions, but has placed limits on their\n22 use.7  In Carey v. Piphus, the Court considered whether plaintiffs could recover\n23 substantial nonpunitive damages in a ยง 1983 action solely on the ground that their\n24\n25\n7  The term โpresumed damagesโ is employed in this order because the term\n26\nโgeneral damagesโ has developed a broader and vaguer meaning.  See, e.g., State\n27 Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 425-26 (2003) (referring to all\ncompensatory damages in contrast to punitive damages); Phelps v. Stostad, 16 Cal.\n28\n4th 23, 27-28 (1997) (referring to compensation for any non-economic injuries).\n20\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 21 of 34   Page ID\n #:4733\n1 right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment was violated, without\n2 having to prove any actual injury.  Carey, 435 U.S. at 252.  The plaintiffs were\n3 students who had been summarily suspended from school.  The defendants did not\n4 dispute that the plaintiffs were denied due process, but argued that unless the\n5 plaintiffs could prove an actual injury resulting from the constitutional violation,\n6 they were entitled โat most to nominal damages.โ  Id. at 251 n.5 & 254.  The\n7 Supreme Court agreed.  It explained that โdamages awards under ยง 1983 should be\n8 governed by the principle of compensationโ drawn from tort law.  Id. at 258. \n9 Recognizing that the common law of torts will in some cases โparallel closely the\n10 interests protected by particular constitutional rightโ โ and in other cases fail to\n11 do so โ the Court held that โthe rules governing compensation for injuries caused\n12 by the deprivation of constitutional rights should be tailored to the interests\n13 protected by the particular right in question . . . .โ  Id. at 259.  The Court rejected\n14 the argument that โinjury fairly may be โpresumedโ to flow from every denial of\n15 procedural due process.โ  Id. at 261.  It concluded that the policy considerations\n16 supporting the presumption of injury in defamation actions under the common law\n17 do not apply to deprivations of procedural due process.  Id. at 262-63.\n18 In Memphis Community School Dist. v. Stachura, the Supreme Court\n19 considered the trial of a ยง 1983  claim in which the jurors were told to award\n20 damages based on the โvalue you place on [the] Constitutional right which you\n21 find was denied . . . .โ  Stachura, 477 U.S. at 303.  The Court reaffirmed its\n22 holding in Carey that ordinarily, damages in a ยง 1983 case are designed to provide\n23 compensation for the injury caused to the plaintiff by the defendantโs violation of\n24 a constitutional right.  Id. at 305-308.  Thus, โthe abstract value of a constitutional\n25 right may not form the basis for ยง 1983 damages.โ  Id. at 308.  It made no\n26 difference that the right at issue in Stachura was the substantive right to freedom\n27 of speech under the First Amendment, in contrast to the procedural right at issue in\n28 Carey.  Id. at 309.  โ[W]hatever the constitutional basis for ยง 1983 liability, such\n21\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 22 of 34   Page ID\n #:4734\n1 damages must always be designed to compensate injuries caused by the\n2 constitutional deprivation.โ  Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \n3 The Court also rejected the plaintiffโs argument that the instruction legitimately\n4 authorized a form of โpresumed damages,โ observing that โ[p]resumed damages\n5 are a substitute for ordinary compensatory damages, not a supplement for an award\n6 that fully compensates the alleged injury.โ  Id. at 310.\n7 In Stachura, the Court left open the possibility that โ[w]hen a plaintiff seeks\n8 compensation for an injury that is likely to have occurred but difficult to establish,\n9 some form of presumed damages may possibly be appropriate.โ  Id. at 310-11\n10 (citing defamation suits).  โIn those circumstances, presumed damages may\n11 roughly approximate the harm that the plaintiff suffered and thereby compensate\n12 for harms that may be impossible to measure.โ  Id. at 311.  For example, older\n13 cases in which damages were awarded for violations of the right to vote appeared\n14 to involve โan award of presumed damages for a nonmonetary harm that cannot\n15 easily be quantified.โ  Id. at 311 n.14 (citing Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U.S. 536\n16 (1927) and Lane v. Wilson, 307 U.S. 268 (1939)).  Nevertheless, the validity of\n17 presumed damages was not litigated in those cases.  See Lane, 307 U.S. at 269-71;\n18 Nixon, 273 U.S. at 539-40.  Stachura even casts some doubt on โthe wisdom of\n19 these decisions in the context of the changing scope of compensatory damages\n20 over the course of this century . . . .โ  Id.\n21 Nor has the Ninth Circuit decided whether presumed damages are\n22 appropriate in ยง 1983 cases.  In Trevino v. Gates, 99 F.3d 911 (9th Cir. 1996), a\n23 wrongful death action based on a police shooting, the jury was instructed that it\n24 could award compensatory damages based on proof of the plaintiffโs actual injury,\n25 or, if it found insufficient evidence of actual injury, it should award nominal\n26 damages based solely on the constitutional violation.  Id. at 921.  The jury\n27 awarded nominal damages, and on appeal the plaintiff argued that the jury should\n28 have been given the option to award presumed damages.  Id.  In rejecting this\n22\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 23 of 34   Page ID\n #:4735\n1 argument, the Court of Appeals cited Carey for the general proposition that\n2 โ[p]resumed damages are appropriate when there is a great likelihood of injury\n3 coupled with great difficulty in proving damages.โ  Id. at 921 (citing Carey, 435\n4 U.S. at 264).  Trevino was not such a case, however.  Because the plaintiff โably\n5 presented evidence and argued to the jury she was entitled to compensatory\n6 damages for emotional and economic harm, . . . a presumed damages instruction\n7 was not mandated.โ  Id. at 922.\n8 Nominal damages are an alternative way to โvindicat[e] deprivations of\n9 certain โabsoluteโ rights that are not shown to have caused actual injury . . . .โ \n10 Carey, 435 U.S. at 266.  โWhen a plaintiff alleges violation of a constitutional\n11 right, the Supreme Court has held that, even if compensatory damages are\n12 unavailable because the plaintiff has sustained no actual injury โ such as an\n13 economic loss, damage to his reputation, or emotional distress โ nominal\n14 damages are nonetheless available in order to โmake the deprivation of such right\n15 actionableโ and to thereby acknowledge the โimportance to organized society that\n16 the right be scrupulously observed.โโ  Jacobs v. Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist., 526 F.3d\n17 419, 426 (9th Cir. 2008) (quoting Carey, 435 U.S. at 266) (internal brackets\n18 omitted).  Nominal damages are different from presumed damages, however,\n19 because they do not compensate the plaintiff for an actual injury.  See Hazle v.\n20 Crofoot, 727 F.3d 983, 992-93 (9th Cir. 2013) (nominal damage awards provide\n21 insufficient compensation โfor unlawful conduct resulting in the loss of liberty.โ).8\n22 Unlike the Ninth Circuit, the Second Circuit has explicitly sanctioned the\n23 use of presumed damages as compensation for constitutional torts.  See Kerman v.\n24 City of New York, 374 F.3d 93, 130 (2d Cir. 2004).  In Kerman, the plaintiffโs\n25 Fourth Amendment rights were violated when he was handcuffed and detained for\n26 psychiatric evaluation, but the jury only awarded him nominal damages.  The\n27\n28\n8  Plaintiffs have not asked for nominal damages.  (See SAC at 28.)\n23\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 24 of 34   Page ID\n #:4736\n1 Court of Appeals held that โwhere the jury has found a constitutional violation and\n2 there is no genuine dispute that the violation resulted in some injury to plaintiff,\n3 the plaintiff is entitled to an award of compensatory damages as a matter of law.โ \n4 Id. at 124.  In this case, the jury should have been instructed โthat if the jury found\n5 that [the defendant] detained Kerman and sent him to the hospital without\n6 probable cause, which necessarily curtailed Kermanโs liberty, Kerman was,\n7 independently of his claims of physical, mental, emotional, or economic injury,\n8 entitled to be compensated for that loss of liberty.โ  Id. at 128 (emphasis added).\n9 The Ninth Circuitโs recent opinion in Hazle v. Crofoot cited portions of\n10 Kerman with approval, but did not address Kermanโs theory that juries in ยง 1983\n11 cases should be instructed that they may award presumed damages for\n12 constitutional violations.  See Hazle, 727 F.3d at 992-93.  In Hazle, the plaintiff\n13 sued his parole agent and other state officials for violating his First Amendment\n14 rights when they revoked his parole and sent him back to prison for refusing to\n15 participate in a religion-based drug treatment program.  Id. at 986-87.  The trial\n16 court found liability as matter of law and held a two-day jury trial on damages. \n17 Hazel based his claim for compensatory damages on evidence of his emotional\n18 distress and loss of liberty from being reincarcerated.  Id. at 989.  The jury\n19 awarded zero damages.  The Court of Appeals explained that the juryโs verdict\n20 was invalid โin light of proof of actual injury:  Hazleโs unlawful imprisonment\n21 because of his exercise of his First Amendment rights.โ  Id. at 992.  The court\n22 quoted Kerman for the proposition that โโwhere the jury has found a constitutional\n23 violation and there is no genuine dispute that the violation resulted in some\n24 [actual] injury to plaintiff, the plaintiff is entitled to an award of compensatory\n25 damages as a matter of law.โโ  Id. at 992 (adding โ[actual]โ to the quotation from\n26 Kerman, 374 F.3d at 124).  It was unnecessary to address Kermanโs theory of\n27 presumed damages, however, because Hazel had so obviously been injured by the\n28 violation of his religious freedom:  he was incarcerated for being an atheist.  For\n24\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 25 of 34   Page ID\n #:4737\n1 example, Hazel introduced evidence about prison conditions.  Id. at 989.  Thus,\n2 Hazel involved a concrete and ascertainable injury, not โan injury that is likely to\n3 have occurred but difficult to establish, [for which] some form of presumed\n4 damages may possibly be appropriate.โ  Stachura, 477 U.S. at 310-11.\n5 As in Hazel, if the individual plaintiffsโ claims in this case were tried\n6 separately, it would not be necessary to employ the concept of โpresumed\n7 damages.โ  If a plaintiff successfully established that the manner in which she was\n8 searched was unconstitutionally โinvasiv[e]โ or โabusive,โ Florence v. Board of\n9 Chosen Freeholders of County of Burlington, 132 S. Ct. 1510, 1523 (2012), then\n10 the jury would have concrete evidence about how that particular search was\n11 conducted.  The jury could then assess compensatory damages on the basis of this\n12 evidence together with the plaintiffโs testimony about her physical or emotional\n13 injuries.  See, e.g., Hazle, 727 F.3d at 989-92; Trevino, 99 F.3d at 921-22. \n14 Plaintiffsโ declarations demonstrate that there is no need to presume injury,\n15 because the declarants explicitly describe the emotional, physical, and mental\n16 anguish they suffered.9  Under these circumstances, it would be inappropriate to\n17 instruct a jury that it could award โpresumed damagesโ to โroughly approximate\n18 the harm that the plaintiff suffered and thereby compensate for harms that may be\n19 impossible to measure.โ  Stachura, 477 U.S. at 311 (emphasis added).  Plaintiffsโ\n20 injuries are not โdifficult to establish.โ  Id.

H.U.D., 960 F.2d 572,\n7 581-83 (6th Cir. 1992) (no need to presume damages where plaintiff presented\n8 evidence of emotional distress); Lewis v. Harrison Sch. Dist. No. 1, 805 F.2d 310,\n9 317-18 (8th Cir. 1986) (โAny door left open [for presumed damage awards] by\n10 [Stachura] is not for plaintiffs like Lewis, whose damages are readily\n11 measurable.โ)\n12 Despite the availability of evidence of actual injuries, plaintiffs propose to\n13 recover only presumed damages and forego any classwide claims for โspecial\n14 damages.โ  (Reply at 16.)  If a fixed value could be assigned to the injuries\n15 resulting from every unconstitutionally abusive strip search, then common\n16 questions surely would predominate over individual questions.  To obtain class\n17 certification, therefore, plaintiffs would impose an artificial homogeneity on the\n18 complex facts.  This is Rule 23 in reverse.  Instead of asking whether common\n19 questions predominate over individual ones so that a class action would be\n20 superior to individual litigation, as required by Rule 23(b)(3), plaintiffs assume\n21 that a class action is superior, and then frame the question of damages so that it\n22 smooths over all factual variation, thereby eliminating individual questions from\n23 the predominance inquiry.  Cf. Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2559 (named plaintiffsโ\n24 decision not to seek compensatory damages โplace[d] at risk potentially valid\n25 claims for monetary reliefโ and โmade it more likely that monetary relief would\n26 not โpredominateโ [over injunctive relief]โ for purposes of certification under Rule\n27 23(b)(2)).\n28 Plaintiffs further propose that if this case does not settle after certification of\n26\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 27 of 34   Page ID\n #:4739\n1 a damages class, then โgeneral damages would be tried class wide, and individual\n2 plaintiffs could file for individual damages if they so choose.โ  (Reply at 16-17.) \n3 This would unfairly expose defendants to duplicative damage awards, and\n4 violate the rule that โ[p]resumed damages are a substitute for ordinary\n5 compensatory damages, not a supplement for an award that fully compensates the\n6 alleged injury.โ  Stachura, 477 U.S. at at 310.  This flawed proposal reveals the\n7 problem inherent in plaintiffsโ argument for certification of a damages class.  If the\n8 โpresumed damagesโ uniformly awarded for every unconstitutional search would\n9 be inadequate compensation for the actual injuries suffered by all class members,\n10 then individual questions about damages would remain unresolved following\n11 resolution of the classwide issues.  This confirms that on the issue of damages for\n12 the physical and emotional pain and suffering caused by the strip searches\n13 conducted at CRDF, common questions do not in fact predominate over individual\n14 questions.\n15 The two district court decisions cited by plaintiffs are not persuasive. The\n16 Nassau County Strip Search Cases, which predated Florence, concerned a blanket\n17 strip search policy at a county jail.  The plaintiffs claimed a common โinjury to\n18 human dignityโ from the allegedly unconstitutional visual body cavity searches.10 \n19 See Nassau County Cases, 2008 WL 850268, at *1, 3.  The claims were not\n20 predicated on particular facts about the conditions under which the searches were\n21 conducted.  See In re Nassau County Strip Search Cases, 742 F. Supp. 2d. 304,\n22 322 (E.D.N.Y. 2010) (subsequent proceedings).  Because the district court was in\n23 the Second Circuit, it relied on Kerman to conclude that a presumed damages\n24 award was warranted for the โdignitary harmโ caused by the searches.  Nassau\n25\n26\n10  The New York district court recently reversed its finding of liability under\n27 ยง 1983 for the blanket search policy in light of Florence.  In re Nassau County Strip\nSearch Cases, __ F. Supp. 2d. __, 2013 WL 3805659, at *12-13 (E.D.N.Y. July 18,\n28\n2013).\n27\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 28 of 34   Page ID\n #:4740\n1 County Cases, 2008 WL 850268, at *4-6.  The court observed that prior judicial\n2 opinions describing โโthe violative quality of unlawful strip searches were offered\n3 without specific references to the plaintiffsโ testimony about their experiences;\n4 rather, the courts spoke to the common nature of the harm caused by strip\n5 searches.โโ Id. at *6 (quoting plaintiffโs argument with approval).  The court then\n6 extended this reasoning to class actions, relying on a Second Circuit case\n7 approving of class-wide monetary relief for a Rule 23(b)(2) class in an\n8 employment discrimination lawsuit.  Id. at 6 (citing Robinson v. Metro-North, 267\n9 F.3d 147, 161 n.6 (2d Cir. 2001)).  This precedent is no longer valid.  See Wal-\n10 Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2560 (disapproving of โTrial by Formulaโ because defendant\n11 was โentitled to individualized determinations of each employeeโs eligibility for\n12 backpayโ); Jermyn v. Best Buy Stores, L.P., 276 F.R.D. 167, 173 (discussing Wal-\n13 Martโs abrogation of Robinson).\n14 Likewise, the District of Columbia courtโs decision in Barnes pre-dates both\n15 Florence and Wal-Mart, and makes similar assumptions about the propriety of\n16 presumed damages for constitutional torts.  See Barnes, 278 F.R.D. at 20 (โBy\n17 โgeneralโ damages, the Court means the injury to human dignity that is presumed\n18 when a person is strip searched . . . .โ).  Recognizing that class treatment was\n19 inappropriate for the plaintiffsโ separate claims for special damages including\n20 emotional distress, the court limited certification to the issue of general damages. \n21 Id. at 22 (Because not all members of class โwill have been impacted in the same\n22 way, because of differences in those experiences as well as differences in class\n23 membersโ backgrounds and personal characteristics, questions affecting individual\n24 members of the class will necessarily predominate over any questions of law or\n25 fact common to the class.โ)\n26 This is a case about the manner and conditions under which otherwise\n27 presumptively valid strip searches were conducted.  If the searches were\n28 conducted in a manner that violates the Constitution, then presumed damages\n28\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 29 of 34   Page ID\n #:4741\n1 would not be an adequate substitute for the class membersโ compensatory\n2 damages, which could readily be established on an individual basis through\n3 testimony.  For this reason, plaintiffs have failed to establish that a class should be\n4 certified under Rule 23(b)(3) for the purpose of determining liability and damages.\n5 (a) Certification Solely on Issue of Liability\n6 As an alternative, plaintiffs suggest that the Court could certify a Rule\n7 12(b)(3) class solely on the issue of liability, leaving individual damage\n8 determinations to subsequent separate proceedings.  Federal Rule of Civil\n9 Procedure 23(c)(4) provides:  โWhen appropriate, an action may be brought or\n10 maintained as a class action with respect to particular issues.โ   The Supreme\n11 Court has yet to decide whether this provision permits a court to certify a class\n12 under Rule 23(b)(3) only on particular issues.  Professor Rubenstein has observed\n13 that โcourts and commentators are sharply split on when issue certification is\n14 proper under Rule 23(c)(4).โ  2 Rubenstein ยง 4:91, at 381-82 (footnote omitted). \n15 The Fifth Circuit has rejected the use of the rule to โmanufacture predominanceโ\n16 where it is otherwise absent.  Castano v. American Tobacco Co., 84 F.3d 734, 745\n17 n.1 (5th Cir. 1996).  โReading rule 23(c)(4) as allowing a court to sever issues\n18 until the remaining common issue predominates over the remaining individual\n19 issues would eviscerate the predominance requirement of rule 23(b)(3); the result\n20 would be automatic certification in every case where there is a common issue, a\n21 result that could not have been intended.โ  Id.  But the Second Circuit has argued\n22 that โthe Fifth Circuitโs view renders subsection (c)(4) virtually null . . . .โ  In re\n23 Nassau County Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d 219, 226 (2d Cir. 2006).  The Second\n24 Circuit therefore takes the opposite position, holding that โa court may employ\n25 subsection (c)(4) to certify a class as to liability regardless of whether the claim as\n26 a whole satisfies Rule 23(b)(3)โs predominance requirement.โ  Id. at 227.\n27 Professor Rubenstein reports that the Ninth Circuit is the only other circuit\n28 to have take an explicit position on the viability of โissue classes.โ  2 Rubenstein\n29\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 30 of 34   Page ID\n #:4742\n1 ยง 4:91, at 382 (citing Valentino v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 97 F.3d 1227, 1234 (9th\n2 Cir. 1996)).  In Valentino, the Court of Appeals reversed a district courtโs\n3 certification of a nationwide class of people who had used an anti-epilepsy drug. \n4 The court found the certification order โbrief and conclusory,โ observing that it\n5 was โentered with the express hope on the part of the district judge of encouraging\n6 settlement . . . .โ  Id. at 1234.  The record did not show that โsome key\n7 requirements of Rule 23 have been satisfied,โ namely, typicality, adequacy, and\n8 commonality.  Id.  In describing the commonality requirement, the Court of\n9 Appeals cited its 1982 opinion in In re Dalkon Shield IUD Products Liab. Litig.,\n10 693 F.2d 847, 856 (9th Cir. 1982).  In that opinion, which also denied certification\n11 of a nationwide class in a products liability action, the Court of Appeals observed\n12 in the course of describing the superiority requirement that โ[a] trial court can\n13 sever and try only certain issues on a class basis under Rule 23(c)(4)(A).โ  Id. at\n14 856.  Citing this statement and the views of commentators, Valentino explained:\n15\nEven if the common questions do not predominate over the\n16 individual questions so that class certification of the entire\naction is warranted, Rule 23 authorizes the district court in\n17 appropriate cases to isolate the common issues under Rule\n23(c)(4)(A) and proceed with class treatment of these particular\n18 issues.\n19 Valentino, 97 F.3d at 1234.  The court did not explain which cases might be\n20 โappropriate casesโ for severance of particular issues.  It was unnecessary to\n21 address this question in view of the numerous โdeficiencies in this certification\n22 [order].โ  See id. at 1234-35.  The Court of Appeals concluded that โthe district\n23 court abused its discretion by certifying particular issues for class adjudication.โ \n24 Id. at 1234.\n25 In view of the context in which Valentino described โissue classesโ โ in an\n26 opinion ultimately rejecting the district courtโs certification order for a variety of\n27 reasons โ Professor Rubenstein observes that the Ninth Circuitโs description of\n28 the role of Rule 23(c)(4) is dicta.  2 Rubenstein ยง 4:91, at 381 n.5.  Even as dicta,\n30\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 31 of 34   Page ID\n #:4743\n1 however, the panelโs endorsement of the use of issue classes is instructive to a\n2 district court in this circuit.  See Barapind v. Enomoto, 400 F.3d 744, 750-51 (9th\n3 Cir. 2005) (en banc); Cetacean Community v. Bush, 386 F.3d 1169, 1173 (9th Cir.\n4 2004) (โThe line [between dicta and holdings] is not always easy to draw,\n5 however, for โwhere a panel confronts an issue germane to the eventual resolution\n6 of the case, and resolves it after reasoned consideration in a published opinion,\n7 that ruling becomes the law of the circuit, regardless of whether doing so is\n8 necessary in some strict logical sense.โโ) (quoting United States v. Johnson, 256\n9 F.3d 895, 914 (9th Cir. 2001) (Kozinski, J., concurring)).  Other Ninth Circuit\n10 panels have subsequently endorsed โusing Rule 23(c)(4) to certify specific issues\n11 under the Rule 23(b)(2) standard.โ  Sepulveda v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 464 Fed.\n12 Appx. 636, 637 (9th Cir. 2011) (unpublished) (observing that in previous order\n13 remanding case to district court โwe instructed the district court to reconsider, in\n14 the alternative, using Rule 23(c)(4) . . . .โ); see also Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores,\n15 Inc., 603 F.3d 571, 620 n.43 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc) (โRelying on Rule 23(c)(4),\n16 our own precedent also generally allows class treatment of common issues even\n17 when not all issues may be treated on a class basis.โ) (citing Valentino and the\n18 Second Circuitโs opinion in the Nassau County strip search cases), reversed on\n19 other grounds by Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. 2541.\n20 Assuming that in the Ninth Circuit, the Second Circuitโs endorsement of\n21 issue classes will prevail over the Fifth Circuitโs contrary view, plaintiffs\n22 nevertheless have failed to satisfy their burden of demonstrating that a class action\n23 on the issue of liability alone will be โsuperior to other available methods for fairly\n24 and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3); Valentino,\n25 97 F.3d at 1234-35 (โA class action is the superior method for managing litigation\n26 if no realistic alternative exists.โ ).  In this case, separate trials are a realistic and\n27 superior alternative to a class that is limited to the issue of liability.  In separate\n28 trials, each plaintiff would be able to present evidence not just about the\n31\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 32 of 34   Page ID\n #:4744\n1 conditions common to all searches at CRDF, but about the individual\n2 characteristics of the searches she personally experienced, including evidence of\n3 unsanitary conditions or search methods, whether she had a disability and whether\n4 it was accommodated, whether men outside the bus bay saw her, and whether\n5 deputies were physically abusive or used demeaning language.  Thus, at an\n6 individual trial, there would potentially be more evidence supporting the\n7 plaintiffโs contention that the searches she endured were conducted in an\n8 unconstitutionally invasive or abusive manner than there would be if the liability\n9 determination were based solely on the common conditions of the searches.  There\n10 would also be more evidence supporting emotional distress damages.\n11 In contrast, certification of a class on the issue of liability alone would entail\n12 first holding a trial on whether the common characteristics of the searches renders\n13 them unconstitutional, and then, if the Court found liability, proceeding with\n14 potentially thousands of jury trials.  At each such trial, evidence concerning the\n15 uncommon conditions experienced by the plaintiff would be inadmissible, since\n16 the question of liability would already have been established on the basis of the\n17 common evidence.  The only question for the jury would be the extent of the class\n18 memberโs damages that are attributable to those unconstitutional common\n19 conditions.  Emotional distress resulting from abusive behavior or demeaning\n20 language by deputies, for example, would not be recoverable, since the sporadic\n21 occurrence of these acts contrary to LASD policy would not have been a part of\n22 the factual basis for the prior classwide finding of liability.  With issue\n23 certification, therefore, both the evidence of liability and the evidence of damages\n24 would be more limited than in separate trials.\n25 Plaintiffs have submitted neither evidence nor argument indicating that the\n26 potential recoveries available to class members in individual lawsuits are\n27 insufficient to create an incentive to litigate their claims.  A plaintiff in a ยง 1983\n28 case is entitled to recover attorneysโ fees even if the jury awards only nominal\n32\n\nCase 2:10-cv-01649-SVW-JEM   Document 232   Filed 03/12/14   Page 33 of 34   Page ID\n #:4745\n1 damages for the constitutional violation.  42 U.S.C. ยง 1988; Farrar v. Hobby, 506\n2 U.S. 103, 112 (1992); Cummings v. Connell, 402 F.3d 936, 946 (9th Cir. 2005).\n3 Moreover, under count five of the complaint, each plaintiff would be entitled to โa\n4 maximum of three times the amount of actual damage but in no case less than four\n5 thousand dollars ($4,000), and any attorneyโs fees that may be determined by the\n6 court in addition thereto . . . .โ  Cal. Civil Code ยง 52(a); (see SAC ยถยถ 117-21).\n7 In view of the need for individual trials on damages regardless of whether\n8 an issue class on liability is certified, it appears that โthe time saved by a class\n9 actionโ would be โrelatively insignificantโ in this case.  Dalkon Shield, 693 F.2d at\n10 856.  In contrast, with individual lawsuits, โ[a] few verdicts followed by\n11 settlements might be equally efficacious.โ  Id.\n12 The parties briefed the issue of superiority on the assumption that all of\n13 plaintiffsโ allegations about the conditions of the strip searches would be part of\n14 the common question for classwide resolution.  For this reason, the parties have\n15 not addressed the different question of whether a class action on liability only\n16 (where the issue to be resolved is limited to the common conditions of all CRDF\n17 strip searches) would be superior to individual actions (in which all of plaintiffsโ\n18 allegations about the searches could be litigated regardless of whether the\n19 conditions of every search are uniform).  Accordingly, plaintiffs will be given an\n20 opportunity to argue that even with the common question framed more narrowly\n21 than they originally proposed, a class action on the issue of liability alone would\n22 be superior to individual litigation.\n23 IV.
