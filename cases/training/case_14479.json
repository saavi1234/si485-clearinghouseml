    "summary": "<p>The plaintiffs in this case were the Maryland State Conference of NAACP Branches and the Baltimore City Branch of the NAACP, alongside a putative class of individuals allegedly subject to constitutional violations by the Baltimore Police Department (BPD). They filed suit in Maryland state trial court on June 15, 2006, represented by the ACLU of Maryland and private counsel, alleging violations of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution; analogues in Maryland&rsquo;s state constitution; and state tort law. The individual plaintiffs sought punitive and compensatory damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, attorneys&rsquo; fees, and expungement of their arrest records. After making initial appearances in the state court, the defendants removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland on July 21, 2006. There, the case was initially assigned to Judge Richard D. Bennett before being re-assigned to Judge Catherine C. Blake.</p>\r\n<p>The claims in this suit fell into three groups. First, the plaintiffs accused the BPD, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, the Mayor individually, current and former BPD commissioners, and individual police officers of conducting or otherwise participating in allegedly unlawful arrests. Second, the plaintiffs asserted claims against the State of Maryland, the Secretary of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, the Commissioner of the Division of Pretrial Detention, current and former wardens at the Central Booking and Intake Center (CBIC) and CBIC officers for allegedly unlawful strip searches and &ldquo;over detentions.&rdquo; Finally, the plaintiffs claimed that the Baltimore City loitering ordinance was unconstitutional as applied, or in the alternative unconstitutional on its face.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the particular claims, the plaintiffs sought to represent a class of &ldquo;arrestees who were (1) arrested by the Police Department without probable cause and (2) released without charges after being booked at CBIC.&rdquo; The plaintiffs sought only equitable relief on behalf of the putative class. The individual plaintiffs moved to certify the putative class on April 25, 2008, but the court did not act on that motion before the parties agreed to settle the case.</p>\r\n<p>On July 28, 2006, the BPD, Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, and Martin O&rsquo;Malley filed a motion to dismiss (or in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment). And on September 27, 2006, the BPD moved to dismiss or for summary judgment as to one particular putative class representative. On December 1, 2006, Judge Blake granted in part and denied in part the July 28 motion to dismiss, and likewise granted in part and denied in part the September 27 motion for summary judgment. Specifically, Judge Blake agreed that BPD was entitled to sovereign immunity from the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims for damages and that the City was shielded by &ldquo;governmental immunity&rdquo; from the plaintiffs&rsquo; tort claims. However, Judge Blake found that the plaintiffs had sufficiently pleaded their unlawful arrest claims. Finally, Judge Blake determined that discovery was necessary before it could be ascertained whether the plaintiffs&rsquo; claim about BPD&rsquo;s interpretation of the loitering ordinance required certification of the question to Maryland state court under Pullman. The parties thus proceeded to discovery.</p>\r\n<p>The court allowed the plaintiffs to amend their complaint on January 4, 2008; the plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint on February 27, 2008. This amended complaint added two new plaintiffs and updated the information for several existing plaintiffs. It also removed all references to a desire to represent a putative class in the complaint. Finally, the amended complaint added and removed certain defendants. For example, the complaint was updated to reflect the fact that Baltimore had elected a new mayor and that the BPD had hired a new commissioner.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs together moved to settle the case pursuant to an agreed upon order on June 25, 2010. In the settlement, the BPD committed to new policies and expanded training. The parties intended that these interventions would ensure that BPD officers knew the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment limits on their authority and that officers would address low-level offenses without escalating to arrest whenever possible. The settlement also required the BPD to implement a new system of data collection and monitoring, overseen by an independent auditor for a term of three years. This auditor would confirm that data collected by the BPD reflected compliance with the Constitution and the BPD&rsquo;s agreed upon internal reforms. Finally, the agreement included payment of $630,000 by the municipal-level defendants for attorneys&rsquo; fees and damages.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Blake granted the motion for settlement and the court marked the case closed on June 29, 2010. An interim report, filed in 2012, found that the City and BPD had not fully complied with the settlement. But the parties&rsquo; auditor filed a final required report on December 31, 2014. In that report, the auditor found substantial compliance with the terms of the settlement, which terminated the court&rsquo;s injunction as expressed in the settlement agreement.</p>",

AND THE BALTIMORE CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT, ET.AL. \n \n \n \n___________ \n \n \n \n \n \nCHARLES F. WELLFORD \nAUDITOR \nJUSTICE ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION SERVICES \nDecember 31, 2014 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 \n \n\n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n  This is the final report of the Auditor for the settlement between the \nMaryland State Conference of the NAACP Branches, et.al. and the Baltimore \nPolice Department (the Department), et.al. (hereinafter the Voluntary Agreement).  \nIt covers the period of January 1, 2014 to September 30, 2014.  The Auditor was \nselected by the parties to the agreement and notified of his selection in October of \n2010.  The Auditor submitted a required work plan and detailed auditors manual \nthat were approved by March of 2011.  The contract for the services of the auditor \nwas issued at the end of July 2011.  The Auditor submitted to the parties, for their \napproval, staff who would work on the audit.  The Auditor was notified of staff \napproval in March of 2011.  The first audit report was submitted April 30, 2012; \nthe second report was submitted October 31, 2012; the third audit report was \nsubmitted April 30, 2013; the fourth audit report was submitted on October 31, \n2013; the fifth audit report was submitted on April 30, 20141. \n  As in the first five reports, this report uses the methods approved in the \nAudit Manual to assess the extent of compliance with each of the auditable tasks \ncontained in the voluntary agreement.  The audit has determined that the Baltimore \nPolice Department is in compliance with 17 of the tasks (48%), in material \ncompliance with 16 of the tasks (46%), and in noncompliance with 2 (6%) of the \n                                                 \n1 Copies of previous reports are available from the Baltimore Police Department. \n2 \n \n\n \ntasks.    These levels of compliance are unchanged from the first five audit reports.   \nWhile the Department continues to make progress in complying with tasks that \naddress policies and procedures, to date the Baltimore Police Department has not \nachieved compliance with the task that measures behavioral changes in arrest \nreports for Quality of Life Offenses2. \nTASK AUDIT \nTask 1.  Within thirty days of the effective date of this Agreement, the Department \nshall issue a policy stating that the Department does not support a policy of Zero \nTolerance Policing.  Quality of Life Offenses3 committed in an officer’s presence \nmay be enforced by several means, including but not limited to:  Counseling, \nverbal warning, written citation or arrest.   \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE   \nThe Department issued a Police Commissioners Memorandum on July 29, \n2010 (PC Memorandum 11-10) that contains all of the elements required by this \ntask. \nTask 2. Within 30 days of the Effective Date of this Agreement, the Department \nshall issue a written directive or directives enumerating the elements of each \nQuality of Life Offense and providing guidance on appropriately identifying and \n                                                 \n2 The Voluntary agreement requires that this report append the comments of the Department.  They are contained in \nAppendix A. \n3In the Voluntary Agreement, Quality of Life Offenses are defined as including the following offenses: “loitering, \ntrespassing, public defecation/urination, open container, disorderly conduct (particularly “failure to obey” and \ndisturbing the peace), hindering, and littering. \n3 \n \n\n \nreacting to conduct that does and does not amount to a Quality of Life Offense, \nincluding guidance on conduct that is protected by the First Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution.   \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE   \nThe Department issued a Police Commissioners Memorandum on July 29, \n2010 (PC Memorandum 13-10) that contains all of the elements required by this \ntask. \nTask 3.  The written directive or directives concerning Quality of Life Offenses \nrequired by Section IV.B.1.a.2 of the Voluntary Agreement shall include a \nrequirement that any time an officer effects a custodial arrest for a Quality of Life \nOffense, the officer shall record in the incident report and the statement of \nprobable cause the factual basis for his or her decision to effect a custodial arrest, \nrather than providing counseling, a verbal warning or issuing a citation.  \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE   \nThe Department issued a Police Commissioners Memorandum on July 29, \n2010 (PC Memorandum 14-10) that exceeds the requirements of this task. \na.    The Auditor shall review a statistically meaningful sample of statements \nof probable cause required by section IV.B.1.a.2.a to determine whether the \nfactual narrative of the arrest could on its face support a finding of probable cause \nand that the arrest was in accord with the Policies. \n4 \n \n\n \nSTATUS: NONCOMPLIANCE  \nTo assess compliance with this task the Auditor reviewed all arrests for the \nperiod and identified all arrests involving a Quality of Life Offense.  The auditor \nthen selected a 25% sample of all Quality of Life Offense arrests for the months of \nJanuary 1, 2014 through September 30, 2014.  The Department provided copies of \nthe statements of probable cause for these sampled arrests.  The attorney assisting \nthe auditor read each of the sampled arrests to determine if they contained \nacceptable statements of probable cause and if the arrest was in accord with the \ndepartment’s policies noted in Tasks 1-3 above. These reviews were corroborated \nby the Auditor. \nDuring the current period the Department provided files on 67,932 arrests of \nwhich 3993 (5.9% of all arrests) were for Quality of Life Offenses as defined by \nthe Voluntary Agreement4.  The random sample of these quality of life offenses \ntotaled 999.  Compliance with this task was determined by the analysis of these \nsampled cases.  The Audit Manual stated that to be in full compliance the analysis \nof the sampled cases would have to result in a level of estimated compliance that \nincluded the possibility that 100% of the cases were compliant.   \n                                                 \n4 In our first report we noted that we had also requested and were provided arrest data for April of 2010 and \nSeptember of 2010.  We compared these months to the comparable months in 2011.  This analysis showed a decline \nin arrests and Quality of Life arrests of between 16 and 25%.  For the second report we compared April through \nJune of 2011 with the same months in 2012 and found a 3% decrease in total arrests and about a 1.6% increase in \nquality of life arrests.  In 2013 we find a decrease in quality of life arrests for the same period of .5%. \n5 \n \n\n \nIn the first five reports and in this one, in reviewing the sampled cases to \ndetermine compliance, we encountered two issues.  First, each month a number of \nthe sampled cases of Quality of Life arrests involved arrests for offenses that \nemerged after the stop for the Quality of Life Offense.  For example, an officer \napproaches a person who is on private property and as the officer approaches, the \nperson of interest drops something that later turns out to be a controlled substance.  \nThe officer arrests the person for trespassing and for possession of the controlled \nsubstance without indicating in the report that an alternative to arrest was \nconsidered.  In these instances we determined, after consultation with the parties to \nthe Voluntary Agreement, that as long as the arrest report accurately stated \nprobable cause these arrests would be considered consistent with departmental \npolicy and were compliant for purposes of this audit.  In other words, those arrests \nwere counted as compliant even if the probable cause statement did not indicate \nthat an alternative was considered.  This issue continued in this reporting period \nand was handled the same way as before. \nThe second issue we encountered during the first five reporting periods and \nin the current period was a number of expunged cases for which arrest reports \nwere unavailable.  It was explained that pursuant to statute the Department was \nrequired to expunge the records of those who were arrested but were released \nwithout charges (referred to as RWOC cases).  We sought these records because \n6 \n \n\n \nthese cases are similar to the kind of cases that prompted the lawsuit that resulted \nin the Voluntary Agreement we are auditing.  When the draft report of our first \nreport was reviewed by the representatives of the plaintiffs, they pointed out that \nwhile the statute (Md.Code, Crim. Proc. §10-101) requires expungement in these \ncases, it further requires that the Department retain the record for three years.  The \nDepartment, in response to our inquiry concerning this, stated that after \nexpungement the records were not available through the Department’s \nmanagement information system.  We indicated in our first four reports that during \nthe subsequent reporting periods we would continue to seek access to these cases. \nDuring the last two reporting periods there was a drop in number of these \nexpunged cases.  While during the third reporting period there were a total of 119 \nsampled cases that were expunged, during the current period the number of \nsampled cases that are reported as expunged totals 18.    While in the past we were \nconcerned that the large number of expunged cases would hamper our ability to \naccurately determine compliance, this concern is minimized since the number of \nexpunged cases remains low.  Then and now the Department is not compliant with \nthis task no matter how we handle the expunged cases5.   \nThe Department continues to contend that even if they had access to the \nincident reports for the expunged cases that they could not give them to us for two \n                                                 \n5 During the current reporting period the Department used our review of cases that were not compliant to develop \nand offer new educational programs and materials for supervisors and officers in all police Districts. \n7 \n \n\n \nreasons: 1) the statement of probable cause in the incident report may be different \nfrom the final statement of probable cause; and 2) since the record has been \nexpunged they cannot provide the auditor with a copy of the report that would \nidentify the person arrested because that would violate the purpose of \nexpungement.  Specifically, the Department has contended: \nProbable cause statements pertaining to the arrest of an individual that has \nbeen expunged are not part of the records considered to be in the custody of \nthe Baltimore Police Department.  Maryland Code of Criminal Procedure \nSection 10-103.1 requires that all police records regarding the arrest of a \nperson who is arrested or confined and is released without being charged \nwith the commission of a crime are entitled to an automatic expungement.   \n  \nThe State's Attorney's Office has the discretion to determine which cases to \nprosecute.  An individual may be released without charges for numerous \nreasons, all of which are within the prosecutorial discretion of the State's \nAttorney.  Consequently, the Auditor is not required by the terms of the \nSettlement Agreement to speculate on whether there is a direct correlation \nbetween someone being released without charges and the absence of \nprobable cause to arrest.  Furthermore, any estimation of the rate of \ncompliance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement would be \nspeculative, and is not contemplated within the task language of the \nSettlement Agreement for this litigation.  Accordingly, any reference to \nsaid materials is outside of the purview of the Auditor's stated tasks6.\t\r  \n\t\r  \nWe have offered a number of ways to address these concerns but to date the \nDepartment contended that they cannot provide to us the information needed to \ndetermine whether those arrests are in compliance or not.  The Auditor continues \nto believe that to conduct a complete assessment of compliance with this task that, \n                                                 \n6 Email from the Office of Legal Affairs, Baltimore Police Department dated 9/11/12. \n8 \n \n\n \neven though the numbers are now small,  access to the expunged cases is \nnecessary. \nThe review of the sampled cases, (not including the expunged cases) for the \ncurrent reporting period, determined that the Department complied with this task \nin 83.2% of the arrests with a margin of error of +/-3%7.  The primary reason for \nnon-compliance was the absence of an explanation of why a non-custodial \ndisposition was not appropriate in the case.  Therefore, it was determined that the \nDepartment was not in compliance (the Auditor’s Manual makes clear that for this \ntask material compliance and compliance are treated without distinction). \nThis finding of noncompliance has been consistent since our first monthly review \nin April of 2011.  Sampled cases reviewed in each month since then have \nconsistently found that the arrest reports do not meet the requirements in \ndepartmental policies adopted in response to the Voluntary Agreement.  Table 1 \nshows the monthly levels of compliance beginning in April 2011 (411 in the Table) \nthrough September of 2014 (914 in the Table).  These data demonstrate there has \nbeen no systematic improvement in arrests reports for quality of life offenses \nduring this period8. \n                                                 \n7 As noted above, each month a substantial portion of the quality of life arrests included arrests for other offenses.  \nAfter consultation with the parties to the agreement, the Auditor decided that as long as probable cause was \nestablished these arrests were judged to be compliant. If these arrests were eliminated from the analysis, the \ncompliance rate would be 78% (+/-4%).  If the expunged cases were counted as non-compliant and included in the \ndenominator, the compliance rate would be estimated at 76% (+/-4%). \n8 After reviewing a draft of this report, Counsel for the plaintiffs stated: “I think that the non-compliance at least \nwith Task 3.a. means that pursuant to the Settlement Agreement § IV.B.1.b.5, the audit should continue for an \n9 \n \n\n \nTable 1: Monthly Compliance Rates – April 2011 through September 2014 \nCOMPLIANCE\t\r  RATE\t\r  \n100.0\t\r  \n90.0\t\r  \n80.0\t\r  \n70.0\t\r  \n60.0\t\r  \n50.0\t\r  \n40.0\t\r  \n30.0\t\r  \n20.0\t\r  \n10.0\t\r  \n0.0\t\r  \n411\t\r   611\t\r   811\t\r  1011\t\r  1211\t\r  212\t\r   412\t\r   612\t\r   812\t\r  1012\t\r  1212\t\r  213\t\r   413\t\r   613\t\r   813\t\r  1013\t\r  1213\t\r  214\t\r   414\t\r   614\t\r   814\t\r  \n \nTask 4.  Within 30 days of the effective date of this Agreement, the \nDepartment shall issue a written directive requiring officers to provide their names \nand badge numbers to any individual who requests this information.  \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE  \n                                                                                                                                                           \nadditional year.  The Settlement Agreement contemplated 3 years of audits, with an additional year if the \nDepartment was not fully in compliance with the Agreement at the end of the 3 year period.  The Auditor’s Manual \non p. 4 specifies that “Compliance will include compliance and material compliance as defined above provided all \ntasks have been completed when the final report of the Auditor is submitted.”  The continued finding of non-\ncompliance at the end of the 3 year period should, I believe, preclude a finding of overall compliance with the \nagreement, and should trigger the additional year of monitoring, during which, I hope, the BPD will finally come \ninto full compliance.  I also note, as I did with respect to the previous Report, that the continued refusal to provide \ninformation on expunged cases is inexplicable given Commissioner Batts’ promise to us in October, 2013 that the \ndata would be provided. (Email to Auditor dated 12/9/14). \n10 \n \n\n \nThe Department issued Police Commissioners Memorandum (14-10) on July \n29, 2010 that met all of the requirements of this task. \nTask 5.  The Zero Tolerance Policing policy required by section IV.B.1.a.1 shall \nnot be rescinded or diminished by the Department during the term of this \nAgreement.  \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE  \nThe Auditor has verified that this policy has not been rescinded. \nTask 6.  The written directive or directives required by section IV.B.1.a.2 of the \nVoluntary Agreement shall not be rescinded or diminished by the Department \nduring the term of this Agreement unless (a) the Department determines, in good \nfaith and upon advice of counsel, that the policies conflict or will conflict with any \napplicable law, regulation, or court order; or (b) the Department determines in \ngood faith that such rescission or diminishment is necessary for the safety of the \npublic or Department personnel.  In the event the Department concludes a \nmodification of the written directive or directives required by section IV.B.1.a.2 is \nnecessary, it will notify Plaintiffs’ Counsel of the planned modification and offer a \nreasonable opportunity for Plaintiffs’ Counsel to comment upon it.  The \nDepartment shall in good faith consider such comments.  \nTHERE IS NO AUDIT FUNCTION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TASK AND IT \nWILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN AUDIT REPORTS.  HOWEVER, IF CHANGES \n11 \n \n\n \nARE MADE USING THE PROCESS SPECIFIED THE AUDITOR WILL \nINCLUDE THOSE CHANGES IN THE AUDIT MANUAL AFTER BEING \nINFORMED OF THE CHANGES BY THE DEPARTMENT. \nSTATUS: NO CHANGES NOTED \nTask 7.  The Municipal Defendants shall provide the Auditor with access to all \nofficers, employees, documents, and data of the Municipal Defendants that are \nreasonably necessary to complete the Tasks enumerated in this Agreement.  \nTHERE IS NO AUDIT FUNCTION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TASK AND IT \nWILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN AUDIT REPORTS.  ALL INSTANCES OF \nFAILURE TO PROVIDE ACCESS WILL BE NOTED IN RELEVANT \nSECTIONS OF THE REQUIRED BI-ANNUAL AUDIT REPORTS ALONG \nWITH AN ASSESSMENT OF HOW SUCH DENIAL MAY HAVE IMPACTED \nTHE AUDIT. \nTask 8.  Within 120 days of the Effective Date of this Agreement, the Department \nshall develop a document and database retention protocol to maintain and retain all \nrecords, including documents and the database described in Section IV.B.1.c of \nthe Voluntary Agreement, documenting compliance with the terms of this \nAgreement and all documents required by or developed pursuant to this \nAgreement.  The protocol shall be evaluated and reported on by the Auditor.   \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n12 \n \n\n \n  As of March 2013, the Department fully implemented a data collection and \nreporting system that provides an automated way to track police officer \nperformance with regards to compliance with Departmental policies.  This system \nis a version of IAPro that incorporates specific elements to address the \nrequirements of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.    A retention protocol that \nmeets the requirements of this Task and includes the information in IAPro was \npromulgated on January 31, 2011 (Police Commissioner’s Memorandum 05-11).    \nTask 9.  Within 180 days of the effective date of this Agreement, the Municipal \nDefendants shall create and automate a database to track police officer \nperformance.   \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  As of March 2013, the Department fully implemented a data collection and \nreporting system that provides for tracking police officer performance with regards \nto compliance with Departmental policies.  This system is a version of IAPro that \nincorporates specific elements to address all the requirements of the Collective \nAgreement.  \nTask 10. Within 180 days of the effective date of this Agreement, the Department \nshall: \n  a.  establish and enforce a policy and procedure requiring shift supervisors to \nreview statements of probable cause for custodial arrests for Quality of Life \n13 \n \n\n \nOffenses to ensure that probable cause in fact existed and that the arrest was in \naccord with the Policies.  If, after this agreement has been in effect for 365 days, \nthe result of the review is a determination that the arrest was in contravention of \nthe Policies, the supervisor shall refer the matter to his or her command for action \nconsistent with the policy established.  If the result of the review is a \ndetermination that the arrest is consistent with the Policies, the supervisor shall \ndetermine the necessity, if any, for non-punitive counseling.  \n  b.  establish and enforce a policy and procedure requiring a line supervisor’s \nreview of probable cause statements for custodial arrests for Quality of Life \nOffenses is reviewed by second-level supervisors on a periodic basis, not to \nexceed every six months, to ensure that probable cause in fact existed and that the \narrest was in accord with the Policies; \n  c.  establish a policy identifying corrective actions, up to and including \ndisciplinary action, as warranted and consistent with established Departmental \ndisciplinary policies, procedures, contracts, memoranda of understanding, and all \napplicable laws governing the discipline of law enforcement officers, including, \nbut not limited to the Law Enforcement Officer’s Bill of Rights. (“LEOBR”), Md. \nAnn. Code, Public Safety Act, 3-101, et seq., to be taken by the Department when \nan officer’s conduct is deemed to be in contravention of the Policies; \nSTATUS: NON-COMPLIANCE \n14 \n \n\n \n\t\r   The Department has established a policy to require supervisors to review \nprobable cause statements in all quality of life arrests.  Furthermore, the \nDepartment also requires periodic review by second-level supervisors.  In addition, \nthe policy requires that each arrest report must be signed by the reporting officer \nand the first level supervisor, usually a sergeant before the report is ready for \nsubmission. Hence there is compliance with sections a and b of this task.  The \n\t\r  \nEarly Intervention Unit is still in place and is identifying officers and imposing \nnon-punitive interventions.  Even though the policy establishing it has not been \npromulgated, the unit is functioning consistent with this task.  The Deputy \nCommissioner reported to the Auditor that the policy would be promulgated very \nsoon.\t\r  \t\r  It is reported that the purpose of the order is to establish early intervention \nwithin the Department, to identify members displaying problematic behavior, and \nprovide them with non-disciplinary corrective guidance.  This will be done via the \nIAPro system and the employee's first line supervisor.  The IAPro system will \nprovide an alert when a member reaches a predetermined threshold within a set \ntime frame for the category.  The triggering alert will list the date, IAD case \nnumber, and BPD central complaint (\"CC\") number. Additionally, a letter will be \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \nsent from the Chief of Internal Affairs to the District Commander indicating that \nthe member has been identified for participation in the early intervention program \nbased upon the number of incidents occurring in the last twelve months.  It directs \n15 \n \n\n \nthe District Commander to ensure that a supervisor conducts an intervention with \nthe member and thereafter monitor the member's work closely for a thirty day \nperiod.  At the conclusion of the monitoring the supervisor must complete an \nadministrative report outlining the course of action taken to correct the member's \nissues.  This will also become part of the member's periodic evaluation.  Because  \nthe Department has not provided the Auditor with the policy it is impossible to \ndetermine if the procedures described to the Auditor are will be followed in the \nfuture.  Even though this policy has not been adopted the Department has provided \ncopies of investigations triggered by the early intervention policy.  These records \ndemonstrate that the Department would be in complete compliance if it had \nadopted the policy but even though it has not been adopted the Department is \nmeeting the intent of this task. \n  Beginning in October 2013 the Department agreed to review the cases that \neach month the Audit has determined to be non-compliant.  Since then the Auditor \nhas sent these cases to the Department,  The Auditor requested that the Department \nhave the appropriate supervisors review these cases and prepare a response \nexplaining why they did not determine them to be non-compliant with \nDepartmental policy.  The Auditor requested access to the responses or a summary \nof the responses.  To date this has not occurred.  The Auditor has not been \ninformed how the Department is using the cases submitted for supervisory review \n16 \n \n\n \nexcept that they are being used to improve training for line officers and \nsupervisors9.    \t\r  \nTask 11.  Within 365 days of the effective date of this Agreement, the Department \nshall develop protocols for use of the database in evaluating compliance with the \nPolicies.  Such protocols shall establish reasonable triggering thresholds for \nreview of officer conduct to monitor effective compliance with the Policies.  The \nprotocols referred to here are the “triggering points” for the EWS.  The Auditor \nwill confirm that each of the protocols required by the Agreement is developed \nand implemented.  The Auditor will also report on the efficacy of the triggering \npoints established by the Department. \nSTATUS:   MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  The Voluntary Agreement requires two types of “triggers”, one for \ncomplaints involving quality of life offenses and a second for quality of life arrests.  \nThe Department has established a policy for Quality of Life complaints that sets \nthe “trigger” at seven complaints in any twelve month period.  As noted in the last \nreport, these triggers could allow a substantial number of complaints in an officer’s \ncareer before there was a mandated non-punitive intervention.  The Early \nIntervention Unit in the Internal Affairs Section of the Department is using these \ntriggers to identify officers who need intervention and is providing that \n                                                 \n9 The failure to provide supervisory reports could be interpreted as non-compliance with Task 7 of the agreement. \n17 \n \n\n \nintervention.  It is clear that the Department, since the introduction of IAPro \nsystem, has fully achieved the requirements of this task.  The efficacy of these \n“triggers” has not been determined by the Department or by this audit.  To do so \nwould take more time and a design not included in the Audit Manual. \nTask 12.  Within 90 days of the effective date of this Agreement, the Municipal \nDefendants shall enter all citizen complaints into a database.  The database shall \ninclude the file number of the complaint (also provided to the complainant); the \nnames of all accused officers, if provided or known; contact information for all \ncomplainants, non-accused but related officers, and witnesses, if provided or \nknown; the race and gender of all involved officers and complainants if known or \nascertainable by reasonable investigation; a narrative description of the \nallegations; significant dates; the street address and district of the incident; and the \ndisposition of the complaint (sustained, not sustained, unfounded or exonerated).  \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  Effective March of 2013 the Department deployed their version of IAPro \nwhich captures all of the elements required by this task for all citizen complaints.  \nThe auditor has reviewed the system and can confirm it is capable of achieving the \nrequirements of this task.  The Audit does not provide for a test of the extent to \nwhich all elements are actually entered for all cases. \n18 \n \n\n \nTask 13.  Complainants shall be allowed to initiate complaints against an officer \nin person, by telephone, by mail, by fax, or via the internet.  A complainant shall \nnot be required to fill out or sign a form to initiate a complaint.  Municipal \nDefendants may seek from the complainant sufficient information to enable the \nidentification of the involved officers and incident.  \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE \n  General Order C-07 issued on April 8, 2004 details the process for receiving \nand processing civilian complaints.  In part it states that a citizen cannot be turned \naway or instructed to go to another office or person to lodge a complaint against a \npolice officer.  However, the citizen is given the address and location of other \noffices where a complaint can be filed.  As specified in that document, in a \nbrochure that has been developed by the Department to explain the complaint \nprocess, and on the Department’s  website (in the FAQ section) which was last \nmodified in August of 2011)) complaints can be made in person, by phone, by \nmail or by e-mail.  While they do not provide for fax submission, these procedures \nare fully compliant with the intent of the task which was to provide multiple ways \nfor the public to file a complaint. \nTask 14.  Complainants shall be permitted to initiate complaints anonymously, in \nwriting or verbally.  Third-part complaints shall be allowed.  \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE \n19 \n \n\n \n   In General Order C-07 and the above referenced brochure and website, \ncitizens are informed that they can file complaints in writing or verbally.  If a \ncomplaint involves allegations of excessive force, discourtesy, or harassment, the \nDepartment requires that the complainants put the complaint in writing and swear \nto its accuracy, but members of the Internal Affairs Division can notarize these \ncomplaints.  While the Department policy and procedures as described on the \nwebsite do not specifically include or exclude third party complaints, the \nDepartment indicates they are accepted.   \n•  For Tasks 13, 14, 18 – 21, the Settling Parties anticipate that the Auditor \nwill evaluate the Department’s compliance with this task by reviewing a \nstatistically meaningful sample of complaint investigation files and other \ndocumentation, if any, identified by the Auditor.  Such sample shall include \na meaningful percentage of investigation files regarding complaints for false \narrest or lack of probable cause for Quality of Life Offenses to satisfy \nsection IV.B.1.b.18 of this Agreement. \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \nThe Auditor requested copies of all citizen complaints involving Quality of \nLife Offenses for the year 2011.  The Department indicated that until their citizen \ncomplaint database was operational they could not identify all such complaints.  \nHowever, they were able to provide those complaints involving false arrests.  The \n20 \n \n\n \nAuditor reviewed the case files for the fifty-one cases supplied by the Department \nand found them to be in compliance with the requirements of Tasks 13, 14, and 18-\n21.  There were no apparent limits on how complaints could be initiated or filed; \ninvestigators sought interviews at times convenient to the complainants; updates \nwere provided; investigators understood and sought to use a preponderance of \nevidence standard; complainants were notified in writing of final determinations.  \nNone of the complaints in these cases were substantiated10.   \nDuring the last reporting period, the Auditor requested copies of all complaints \ninvolving quality of life offenses.  Using IAPro, the Department identified two \ncomplaints during the period April 2013 through October 2013.  Although the \nAuditor cannot independently verify that these are all of the complaints, the \nDepartment has assured the Auditor that all complaints are being entered into \nIAPro and that these two are the only ones involving quality of life offenses.  The \nDepartment asserts that this reflects an overall substantial decline in complaints \nreceived during the past year.  A review of these two complaints indicated there \nwere no apparent limits on how complaints could be initiated or filed; investigators \nsought interviews at times convenient to the complainants; updates were provided; \ninvestigators understood and sought to use a preponderance of evidence standard; \ncomplainants were notified in writing of final determinations.  None of the \n                                                 \n10 In October of 2013 the Department has agreed to provide copies of all Quality of Life complaints that are included \nin IAPro for review by the Auditor. \n21 \n \n\n \ncomplaints in these cases were substantiated.   Therefore, none of the fifty-three \ncomplaints reviewed by the Auditor for the last report had been substantiated.  All \nhad been administratively closed primarily because the complainant had not \nresponded to multiple requests to be interviewed about their complaint. During the \ncurrent reporting period the Department has provided access to the files of officers \nwho have been identified as needing additional training and counseling on how to \nbetter respond to the enforcement of Quality of Life Offenses but has not provided \nany cases documenting the resolution of citizen complaints.   \nTask 15.  Within 180 days of the Effective Date of this Agreement, a telephone \nnumber shall be created to allow for toll free calls to initiate complaints.  \nThe auditor will verify that such a number is created and will on a monthly basis \nverify that it is operational by calling it with a test report. \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE \n  A number is provided on the BPD website and is operational.  Testing each \nmonth demonstrated that the line is operational and being answered. \nTask 16.  Within 180 days of the Effective Date of this Agreement, the telephone \nnumber shall be advertised with the goal that Baltimore residents and visitors \nshould be generally aware of how to initiate a complaint.  \n  The Auditor will verify that the number is advertised by reviewing the \nadvertisement strategies that the Department uses and verifying that the strategies \n22 \n \n\n \nare in fact implemented.  There will be no effort to determine the extent to which \nthe advertising effort reaches the intended audiences. \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE \n  The number has been included on the website and is contained in a brochure \nthat is available in each district station, at police headquarters, and at other City \noffices.  Printed posters are displayed in each District and in the Office of the \nCivilian Review Board, the Legal Affairs Bureau, and the Internal Affairs Office.  \nThe website and the brochure give clear instructions on how to make a complaint.  \nThe Audit does not include an assessment of the success of these strategies. \nTask 17.  Within 365 days of the Effective Date of this Agreement, the Municipal \nDefendants shall publicize information concerning the purpose and goals of the \ncitizen complaint and resolution process, and the process for initiating a complaint, \nincluding publishing and distributing pamphlets describing the complaint and \nresolution process and holding at least one community meeting in each police \ndistrict.  \n  The Auditor will verify that the required information is publicized as \nspecified by reviewing the required pamphlet, how the pamphlet is distributed, and \nthe minutes of all community meetings where the information is discussed and/or \npresented.  Compliance will require development of the pamphlet, its distribution, \n23 \n \n\n \nand documentation of at least one community meeting in each police district where \nthe citizen complaint and resolution process is described.   \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  The Auditor has reviewed the above mentioned brochure and determined \nthat it contains the elements required by this task.  The Department has provided \nminutes of District Council meetings that document the presentation of the \ncomplaint and resolution process in all districts..  \nTask 18.  Investigators shall attempt to interview complainants and witnesses at \ntheir own convenience, but, if necessary, shall offer to conduct interviews during \nnon-business hours or at locations other than Departmental offices.  \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  General Order C-07 requires and the Early Intervention brochure states that \nthe investigator of civilian complaints is to make every effort to “reasonably \naccommodate you during the complaint process”. In addition, the procedures used \nby the Early Intervention Unit specifies the processes to be followed in closing a  \ncase, including specific requirements for administrative closure The Auditor \nrequested copies of all citizen complaints involving Quality of Life Offenses for \nthe year 2011.  The Department indicated that until their citizen complaint database \nwas operational they could not identify all such complaints.  However, they were \nable to provide those complaints involving false arrests.  The Auditor reviewed the \n24 \n \n\n \ncase files for the fifty-one cases supplied by the Department and found them to be \nin compliance with the requirements of Tasks 13, 14, and 18-21.  There were no \napparent limits on how complaints could be initiated or filed; investigators sought \ninterviews at times convenient to the complainants; updates were provided; \ninvestigators understood and sought to use a preponderance of evidence standard; \ncomplainants were notified in writing of final determinations.

None of the complaints in these cases were substantiated.   The \n25 \n \n\n \nDepartment has not provided any complaint files for the current reporting period.  \nDuring the current reporting period, despite numerous requests from the Auditor, \nthe Department has not provided access to any complaints for review nor has it \nindicated whether there are any complaints that could be reviewed. \nTask 19.  If conduct in contravention of Departmental policy, other than the \nconduct alleged by the complainant, is discovered in the course of an investigation, \nthe Department shall investigate such other conduct.  \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  General Order C-08 issued August 26, 2011 specifies the Internal \nInvestigation Division (IID) has responsibility for all investigations of all \nallegations of misconduct by employees of the Department.  This policy does not \nlimit the IID’s ability to initiate investigations of instances of conduct in \ncontravention of Departmental policy that is discovered during the course of an \ninvestigation.  The Department reports it is the practice of the IID to investigate all \nviolations of departmental policy regardless of the manner in which they become \naware of the violation.  A review of 53 cases of citizen complaints noted above \nfound no instance where an investigation uncovered another policy violation, \nhowever, none of these cases came from the current reporting period. During the \ncurrent reporting period, despite numerous requests from the Auditor, the \n26 \n \n\n \nDepartment has not provided access to any complaints for review nor has it \nindicated whether there are any complaints that could be reviewed. \n  \nTask 20.  Upon request, the Department shall provide a complainant reasonable \nupdates on the status of the investigation.  Even absent any such request for \ninformation, complainants shall be apprised of the status of open complaints every \n60 days and promptly upon resolution of the investigation.  \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  The policy on investigations and the above referenced brochure provided to \nthe public make clear that the complainants may contact their assigned investigator \nto get answers to questions about their complaint or to express concerns.  The \nAuditor requested copies of all citizen complaints involving Quality of Life \nOffenses for the year 2011.  The Department indicated that until their citizen \ncomplaint database was operational they could not identify all such complaints.  \nHowever, they were able to provide those complaints involving false arrests.  For \nthe last report, the Auditor reviewed the case files for the fifty-one cases supplied \nby the Department and found them to be in compliance with the requirements of \nTasks 13, 14, and 18-21.  There were no apparent limits on how complaints could \nbe initiated or filed; investigators sought interviews at times convenient to the \ncomplainants; updates were provided; investigators understood and sought to use a \n27 \n \n\n \npreponderance of evidence standard; complainants were notified in writing of final \ndeterminations.  None of the complaints in these cases were substantiated.   \nDuring the last reporting period, the Auditor requested copies of all complaints \ninvolving quality of life offenses.  Using IAPro, the Department identified two \ncomplaints during the period April 2013 through October 2013.

None of the \ncomplaints in these cases were substantiated.   During the current reporting period, \ndespite numerous requests from the Auditor, the Department has not provided \naccess to any complaints for review nor has it indicated whether there are any \ncomplaints that could be reviewed. \n    Task 21.  All findings shall be based on the “preponderance of the evidence” \nstandard, and all investigators shall be trained on that standard.  Investigators shall \n28 \n \n\n \nbe required to state the factual basis for each finding in the final report of each \ninvestigation.  \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  All investigations are conducted to meet the preponderance of evidence test.  \nThis is the burden of proof required by Maryland statute (Md. State Code Ann.§ \n10-217).  Investigators are instructed to use this standard. The Auditor requested \ncopies of all citizen complaints involving Quality of Life Offenses for the year \n2011.  The Department indicated that until their citizen complaint database was \noperational they could not identify all such complaints.  However, they were able \nto provide those complaints involving false arrests.

Using IAPro, the Department \nidentified two complaints during the period April 2013 through October 2013.  \n29 \n \n\n \nAlthough the Auditor cannot independently verify that these are all of the \ncomplaints, the Department has assured the Auditor that all complaints are being \nentered into IAPro and that these two are the only ones involving quality of life \noffenses.  The Department asserts that this reflects an overall substantial decline in \ncomplaints received during the past year.  A review of these two complaints \nindicated there were no apparent limits on how complaints could be initiated or \nfiled; investigators sought interviews at times convenient to the complainants; \nupdates were provided; investigators understood and sought to use a \npreponderance of evidence standard; complainants were notified in writing of final \ndeterminations.  None of the complaints in these cases were substantiated.   During \nthe current reporting period, despite numerous requests from the Auditor, the \nDepartment has not provided access to any complaints for review nor has it \nindicated whether there are any complaints that could be reviewed. \nTask 22.  The Municipal Defendants shall make final determinations of all citizen \ncomplaints, and shall inform each complainant in writing of the final determination \non his or her complaint.  \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE \n  In the 53 complaints reviewed in previous reports by the Auditor the \ncomplainant was informed in writing of the final determination of their complaint.  \nDuring the current reporting period, despite numerous requests from the Auditor, \n30 \n \n\n \nthe Department has not provided access to any complaints for review nor has it \nindicated whether there are any complaints that could be reviewed. \n  \nTask 23.  When a review of an officer’s performance is triggered by a data \nanalysis under Section IV.B.1.c.3 of the Voluntary Agreement, the Department \nshall notify the appropriate supervisor of the officer or officers in question.  This \nnotice shall include the information available from the database (Task 9 above) \nthat triggered the review.  \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  The Department has developed but not promulgated a general order on \nperformance evaluation.    Even though the General Order has not been approved, \nthe Auditor has reviewed thirty-two instances where an officer has been flagged by \nthe Early Intervention unit.  In these cases the Early Intervention Unit is already \nimplementing a system in which supervisors are informed when officers they \nsupervise have met the threshold indicators and are in need of intervention.  The \nnotification includes the indicators that have triggered the need for intervention and \nthe actions taken.    \nTask 24.  Once notified, a supervisor shall conduct a reasonable investigation of \nthe performance of the officer in question by reviewing records relative to the \nconduct that triggered the review (e.g., complaint records, statements of probable \n31 \n \n\n \ncause, incident reports, etc.).  The review shall specifically include a determination \nof the sufficiency of the probable cause underlying each Quality of Life arrest that \nis associated with the conduct under review.  Based upon the review of related \nrecords, the supervisor shall determine, based upon a preponderance of the \ndocumentary evidence, whether the officer’s actions are in contravention of the \nPolicies.  If the result of the review is a determination that the officer’s actions are \nin contravention of the Policies, the supervisor shall refer the matter to his or her \ncommand for action consistent with the policy established under section IV.B.c.2.c \nof the Voluntary Agreement.  If the result of the review is a determination that the \nofficer’s actions are consistent with the Policies, the supervisor shall determine the \nnecessity, if any for non-punitive counseling.  \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  The Department reports and General Order C-08 requires that these \nprocedures are followed.    Under the newly created Early Intervention Unit (EIU), \nthe responsibility for determining when a non-punitive intervention is required has \nbeen shifted from the supervisor to the EIU.  It is the EIU that is responsible for \nsetting the threshold and conducting the review to determine the need for non-\npunitive intervention.  These procedures are considerably more stringent than \nthose required by this Task.    The Auditor has verified that these procedures have \n32 \n \n\n \nbeen followed even though the policy for early intervention has not been \npromulgated.   \nTask 25.  Upon completion of the review, the investigating supervisor shall \nprovide written documentation of the process and the results of the investigation in \nthe form of a review memorandum.  The review memorandum shall specifically \ndocument the conduct of the investigation, the outcome of the review and whether \nthe supervisor provided the officer with non-punitive counseling.  \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  The Department reports and General Order C-08 requires that these \nprocedures are followed.    Under the newly created Early Intervention Unit (EIU), \nthe responsibility for conducting the review, determining the need for non-punitive \nintervention, and monitoring the interventions impact us given to the EIU.  It is the \nEIU that is responsible for setting the threshold and conducting the review to \ndetermine the need for non-punitive intervention.  These procedures are \nconsiderably more stringent than those required by this Task.  The Auditor has \nverified that these procedures have been followed even though the early \nintervention policy has not been promulgated.   \nTask 26.  When an officer’s performance is being reviewed as part of the \nDepartment’s periodic performance evaluation process, copies of any review \n33 \n \n\n \nmemoranda created during the period under review shall be provided to and \nconsidered by the reviewing officer in evaluation the subject officer’s performance.  \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE  The BPD reports and General Order \nC-08 requires that these procedures are followed.    Under the newly created Early \nIntervention Unit (EIU), it is the responsibility of the EIU to inform the supervisor \nand to make sure a report is placed in the officers file. These procedures are \nconsiderably more stringent than those required by this Task.  The Auditor has \nverified that these procedures have been followed even though the early \nintervention policy has not been promulgated. \nTask 27.  When an officer, who is the supervisor of other officers, is the subject of \na review as part of the Department’s periodic performance evaluation process, \ncopies of any review memoranda relating to the officer under the subject officer’s \nsupervision created during the period under review will be provided to and \nconsidered by the reviewing officer in evaluation the subject officer’s \nperformance. \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n    The Department reports and General Order C-08 requires that these \nprocedures are followed.  With the implementation of the IAPro system, the EIU, \nand the proposed General Order on Professional Performance Enhancement \nProgram the Department will be in compliance with this Task.  The Auditor has \n34 \n \n\n \nverified that these procedures have been followed even though the early \nintervention policy has not been promulgated. \nTask 28.  The Municipal Defendants shall monitor citizen complaints related to \nQuality of Life Offenses to gauge the effectiveness of training and to detect the \nneed for new or further training.  \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE \n  It is reported that the BPD Director of Training has revised training curricula \nin response to information on problems in the probable cause statements in some \nQuality of Life arrests.  In addition, the Director has instituted on-going training to \nimprove report writing generally.  The Auditor has not been provided with any \ndocumentation of any training changes that occurred during this reporting period. \nTask 29.  Except with respect to complaints subject to the statutory requirements \nof Article 4, section 16-44 of the Public Local Laws of Maryland, the Municipal \nDefendants shall monitor and be responsible for completing all investigations and \nshall not have discretion to reject a citizen complaint without investigation if \nsufficient information is provided to or obtained by the Municipal Defendants \nthrough reasonable investigation.  \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE \n  Departmental policy (General Order C-07), the essence of which is included \non the Department website describing the complaint process, requires that all \n35 \n \n\n \ncomplaints be investigated.  Our review of the fifty-three complaints noted above \nindicates compliance with this task.   \nTask 30.  Within 120 days of the effective date of this Agreement, the Municipal \nDefendants shall create and maintain individual training records for all police \nofficers, documenting the date and topic of all pre-service and in-service training \ncompleted.  These records shall also reflect whether the training was completed \nsatisfactorily, as well as the reasons for any mandatory re-training. \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE  \n  The Auditor inspected the training records maintained by the training \nacademy and verified that individual records were being maintained and that they \ncontained all elements specified in the task.`  \nTask 31.  Within 180 days of the effective date of the Agreement, the Department \nshall develop training curricula for pre-service and annual in-service training \nregarding Quality of Life Offenses, assessing probable cause, rights protected by \nthe First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, especially the lawful exercise of \nthose rights on City sidewalks and other public areas, and the appropriate officer \nresponse when an individual requests an officer’s name and badge number.  \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE  \n  Within 180 days of the signing of the Agreement, the BPD developed \ntraining guides for pre-service and in-service training on the policies of the \n36 \n \n\n \nDepartment concerning zero tolerance policing, the use of arrest in Quality of Life \nOffenses, the requirement to provide names and badge numbers, and the rights of \nfree speech and assembly.  The training curricula were reviewed by the parties to \nthe agreement and the Auditor and were found to contain all elements specified in \nthis task.  These training guides have been modified based on the review by the \ntraining staff of the cases determined by the Auditor to be non-compliant. \nTask 32.  Within 120 days of the effective date of this Agreement, the Department \nshall provide the training curricula required by section IV.B.1.f of the Voluntary \nAgreement to the Auditor and Plaintiff’s Counsel for comment, to be received no \nlater than 30 days from receipt of the curricula.  The Department shall consider in \ngood faith any comments so received, but is not required to make any changes to \nthe curricula based upon the comments.  \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE  \n  As noted above, the training curricula were provided to the Plaintiff’s \ncounsel and the Auditor for review and comment.  All comments made were \naddressed by the BPD. \nTask 33.  Pre-service training based upon the training curricula required by this \nsection shall be provided to all incoming classes as of the first incoming academy \nclass after the finalization of the training curricula. \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE  \n37 \n \n\n \n  All pre-service requirements since February 2011 have included the training \nspecified in the task. \nTask 34.  In-service training based upon the training curricula required by this \nsection shall be provided to officers beginning with in-service training that occurs \nwithin 90 days of the finalization of the required training curricula, and shall \ncontinue for all in-service training sessions provided during the term of the \nAgreement.  \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE  \n  The in-service training curriculum has been included in all in-service \ntraining plans since it was approved.   \nTask 35.  Notice of this in-service training shall be disseminated to all officers \nemployed by the Department as of the effective date of this Agreement within 120 \ndays of the effective date of this Agreement.  \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  Notice of the in-service requirement was sent to all officers in the BPD on \nFebruary 2. 2011.  This exceeded the requirement of completing this task within \n120 days.  In-service training continues to include these elements. \n   \n \n \n38 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAppendix A \n \nRESPONSE FROM THE BALTIMORE POLICE DEPARTMENT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n39 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n40 \n ",

INTRODUCTION \n1.  Under a pattern and practice set and enforced by city officials, Baltimore \npolice officers arrest individuals without probable cause, in violation of the U.S. \nConstitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights. \n2.  To encourage this pattern and practice, the Baltimore City Police \nDepartment (“Police Department”) rewards police officers with more arrests and \npunishes officers with fewer arrests, regardless of the number or success of resulting \nprosecutions. \n3.  As a consequence, Baltimore prosecutors decided to drop the charges \nagainst approximately 30 percent of those arrested without a warrant in 2005 prior to \nany involvement by a defense attorney, and prior to review of the charges by a Court \nCommissioner. \n4.  The Maryland Central Booking and Intake Center (“CBIC”) receives these \narrestees for processing, and compounds the problem by conducting strip searches \nof male arrestees without probable cause or individualized suspicion that they are \ncarrying weapons or contraband, in violation of the U.S. Constitution and the Maryland \nDeclaration of Rights. \n5.  The volume of arrests by the Police Department has caused CBIC to \ndetain many arrestees beyond the statutory time limit of 24 hours before presentment \nor release, in violation of Maryland Rule 4-212(f) and the Maryland Declaration of \nRights.  In some cases, the detentions have exceeded 48 hours, in violation of the \nU.S. Constitution. \n3  \n\n6.  These unconstitutional and illegal acts degrade, humiliate, and cause \ngrave harm to their victims.  Individuals who are arrested suffer unwarranted \ndeprivation of personal liberty, sometimes for days.  They may lose their jobs or be \ndenied job opportunities in the future as a result of the permanent stigma of having a \ncriminal charge on their record.  They suffer the humiliation of being hauled away in \nhandcuffs in front of friends, family, or neighbors.  At CBIC, they are subjected to the \ndegradation of strip searches—in many cases, visual body cavity searches—in front \nof other detainees.  They are detained, sometimes for days at a time, in fithly, \novercrowded conditions.  Then, when the States’ Attorney declines to prosecute, they \nare Released Without Charge (RWOC’d), though they have technically already been \ncharged by the police—often because the police had no right to arrest them in the first \nplace. \n7.  Despite the patently unconstitutional and illegal nature of this conduct \nand its detrimental effects on the Baltimore residents whom the laws are supposed to \nprotect, city officials have refused to reform their practices.  The time has come to rein \nin this abuse of power and stop these unconstitutional and illegal acts. \nII.  JURISDICTION \n8.  This Circuit Court has exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over this case \nbecause each individual Plaintiff claims damages in excess of $25,000. \n9.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants State of Maryland \n(“State”), the Mayor and City Council of the City of Baltimore (“City”), and the Police \nDepartment because they are entities consisting of or located within Maryland. \n4  \n\n10.  This Court also has personal jurisdiction over individual Defendants \nSaar, Smith, Franks, Murphy, O’Malley, Hamm, Brown, Clark, Norris, Jemini Jones, \nCrites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Does A-F, and Does 1-100.  Upon information \nand belief, Saar, Smith, Franks, Murphy, O’Malley, Hamm, Brown, Jemini Jones, \nCrites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Does A-F, and Does 1-100 maintain domiciles \nwithin the State of Maryland.  In addition, this Court has personal jurisdiction over all of \nthe individual Defendants under Maryland’s long-arm statute because (a) their \ntortious actions and omissions occurred and caused injury within Maryland and (b) \nthey are (or were at the time of the illegal acts) all employed within Maryland, thus \nperforming a character of work or service within Maryland.  \nIII.  PRE-SUIT REQUIREMENTS \n11.  Plaintiffs Howard, Lowery, Braxton, and Stoner have satisfied the \nnecessary pre-suit prerequisites under the Maryland Tort Claims Act and the Local \nGovernment Tort Claims Act for each of the pertinent claims listed below in Section \nVIII. \n12.

ALLEGATIONS OF FACT \nA.  The Experiences of the Individual Plaintiffs \n1.  The Illegal Arrests and Searches of Plaintiffs Howard and \nBraxton \n45.  At approximately 8:30 p.m. on Friday, April 15, 2005, Plaintiff Evan \nHoward was standing on the sidewalk that runs past his home on Poplar Grove Street \nin Baltimore, about a block away from his front door, engaging in conversation with \nPlaintiff Tyrone Braxton and another friend, Correy Alexander. \n46.  After a few minutes, Defendant Officers Jemini Jones and Doe 1 pulled \nup behind Braxton’s car in an unmarked police cruiser.  The plainclothes officers \napproached the three friends and asked if they had any information about a recent \nhomicide. \n47.  The officers then asked Howard, Braxton, and Alexander their ages.  After \nrevealing that he was a minor, Alexander was ordered to go home, which he did. \n48.  Then, without explanation, probable cause, or any legal justification, the \nofficers conducted pat-down searches of Howard and Braxton and placed them under \narrest.  The arrests were purportedly for loitering and impeding the flow of pedestrian \n1 4 \n\ntraffic, even though neither Howard nor Braxton had been loitering and the officers had \nnot ordered them to disperse. \n49.  Officer Jemini Jones tightly bound the young men’s hands with plastic \nhandcuffs and placed Howard and Braxton in a vehicle for transport to CBIC. \n50.  Howard and Braxton arrived at CBIC at about 10:00 p.m., where they \nwaited for approximately an hour to begin the booking process.  Upon entering CBIC, \nthey were screened with a metal detector, which showed that neither carried any \nweapons. \n51.  At approximately 11:00 p.m., Howard and Braxton were subjected to \nhumiliating public strip-searches by Defendant Officers Doe A and Doe B.  Howard, \nBraxton, and two other detainees were placed in a holding cell, ordered to remove all \nof their clothing down to their underpants, face the wall, pull their underpants down to \nexpose their buttocks, and submit to a visual body cavity search. \n52.  The searches were conducted without probable cause or individualized \nsuspicion that either Howard or Braxton was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband. \n53.  Indeed, no contraband was found in the possession of either Howard or \nBraxton during the search. \n54.  After the strip search, Howard and Braxton were taken to a small, filthy, \nand overcrowded cell, where they stayed with about ten other detainees through the \nnight.  The cell had no bathroom and was so overcrowded that both Howard and \nBraxton were forced to sit in uncomfortable positions on filthy floors for long periods of \ntime. \n1 5 \n\n55.  At approximately 8:00 a.m. on Saturday, April 16, Howard and Braxton \nwere taken to a slightly larger cell containing about fifteen other detainees.  This cell \nwas also filthy and unsanitary.  Throughout the day, the number of people in the cell \nfluctuated, frequently swelling to nearly twenty.  Once again, both Howard and Braxton \nwere forced to sit in uncomfortable positions on filthy floors for long periods of time. \n56.  During their confinement, Howard and Braxton were provided “meals” in \ntheir cells three times each day.  The meals principally consisted of two slices of \nbread covering shiny and slimy meat, which Howard and Braxton believed to be \nspoiled bologna. \n57.  Braxton was finally released on Sunday, April 17, at 10:00 a.m., after \nbeing held at CBIC for 36 hours. \n58.  Howard was finally released on Monday, April 18, at 4:00 a.m., after \nbeing held at CBIC for 54 hours.  Howard, far from home and unable to contact \nanyone to pick him up from CBIC, was forced to walk back to his home in the dark at a \ndangerous hour of night through unfamiliar streets. \n59.  Neither Howard nor Braxton was ever prosecuted for any crime or ever \nbrought before a court commissioner.  \n2.  The Illegal Arrest and Search of Plaintiff Wilson \n60.  On April 10, 2006, Plaintiff Donald Wilson was sitting on the front steps \nof a residence in which his girlfriend and toddler son live.  He was visiting them and \nwaiting for his younger brother, Darrell. \n1 6 \n\n61.  While Mr. Wilson was sitting on the steps with two friends, an unmarked \npolice Subaru raced down the street in pursuit of a dirt bike.  A crowd of approximately \n15 neighbors gathered along the block to watch the chase. \n62.  Failing to catch the bicyclist, the maroon police Subaru pulled up to the \nresidence and Officer Crites and Sergeant Pecha exited the vehicle.  Officer Crites, \nyelled, “Everybody sit the f**k down!”  Everyone in the area obeyed.  Wilson, at the time, \nwas already sitting down. \n63.  The officers began questioning the group of people, asking them where \nthey lived and what they were doing there.  Most were patted down and asked to show \nidentification.  Wilson provided his identification when requested. \n64.  Crites questioned Wilson and asked whether Wilson lived there.  When \nWilson firmly responded in the affirmative, Crites took offense and, in a low tone of \nvoice, threatened to “f**k [him] up.” \n65.  When Wilson responded to this threat, by observing that Crites had \nwhispered his threat rather than stating it aloud in front of witnesses, Crites \nimmediately ordered Wilson to stand up.  Wilson asked why, and Crites responded, \n“Don’t f**king say nothing to me,” and ordered Wilson to stand up and put his hands \nbehind his back. \n66.  Wilson complied and asked why he was being arrested.  Crites \nresponded, “Don’t worry about it.  You’re going to jail.” \n67.  Wilson asked Crites for his name and badge number.  Crites replied, \n“911.” \n1 7 \n\n68.  Crites placed metal handcuffs on Wilson and ordered him to sit on the \nground.  At that time, two marked police cruisers arrived at the scene, and two \nadditional officers exited those vehicles. \n69.  Wilson asked his girlfriend to call his mother, and then he remained \ncalm and quiet. \n70.  The police began to tell people to leave.  After about 15 minutes, \nWilson’s mother arrived.  She politely asked who the officer in charge was.  Sgt. \nPecha responded that he was in charge.  Wilson’s mother asked what her son was \nbeing detained for.  Pecha asked for Wilson’s age, and when his mother said, “21,” \nPecha stated that he did not have to give her any information because Wilson was not \na minor.  Upon further questioning, Pecha continued to refuse to explain why Wilson \nwas arrested. \n71.  She therefore went to talk with her son, who explained what had \nhappened.  After about two minutes, Pecha came over and told her that she had to \nleave or she would be arrested.  When she asked for Pecha’s name and badge \nnumber, Pecha ignored her. \n72.  Crites and Pecha did not have nametags on and their badges were \ntucked inside their shirts to hide identifying information. \n73.  Crites put Wilson in the police car and transported him to CBIC at \napproximately 9:15 p.m. \n74.  At CBIC, Wilson was taken to a waiting room, where he was ordered to \nstrip down to his boxers and searched by Does C-D.  A Latino man next to him in the \nsame room was completely naked. \n1 8 \n\n75.  The search was conducted without probable cause or individualized \nsuspicion that Wilson was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband.  Indeed, no \ncontraband was found in his possession. \n76.  Wilson was finally released from CBIC at around 2:00 a.m. the next \nmorning.  He was not allowed to use a phone at CBIC, so he walked to the nearest \npay phone to call his mother. \n77.  Wilson was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court \ncommissioner. \n3.  The Illegal Arrests and Searches of Plaintiffs Stoner and \nLowery \n78.  On May 7, 2005, Plaintiff Aaron Stoner, Plaintiff Robert Lowery, Walter \nMedina, Jr., and four other friends and co-workers visited the city of Baltimore to \ncelebrate Stoner’s upcoming wedding.  After visiting the Inner Harbor, the group of \nfriends left on foot in the early morning hours of May 8 to return to their hotel. \n79.  While walking back to their hotel, a marked police car containing \nDefendant Officers Newkirk and Arnold Jones drove past.  Newkirk instructed the \ngroup to “keep moving,” even though the group had not actually paused during the \njourney.  They obeyed and continued to walk back to their hotel. \n80.  About two minutes later, the same patrol car drove past the group.  \nMedina was the first to see the approaching car, and remarked to Stoner, “Here \ncomes that cop again.” \n81.  Officer Newkirk pulled the car to the side, stopped the car, and exited.  \nNewkirk confronted Medina, the only African-American in the group, demanding, “What \ndid you say, boy?”  Before Medina could answer, Newkirk pushed him against a wall. \n1 9 \n\n82.  After Newkirk pushed Medina against the wall and began to aggressively \nquestion him, Stoner verbally protested.  Newkirk then turned toward Stoner and ran at \nhim with his baton fortifying his raised forearm.  Defendant Newkirk hit Stoner with \nsuch force as to knock Stoner off of his feet. \n83.  Newkirk then instructed Stoner and the other five men to “keep walking.”  \nStoner obeyed by getting up and walking to the rest of the group. \n84.  Newkirk then issued a warning citation for loitering to Medina. \n85.  Lowery, upset at the police harassment and brutality he had witnessed, \nthen left the group, approached Officers Newkirk and Arnold Jones, and asked for \nNewkirk’s name and badge number. \n86.  Newkirk refused to answer Lowery’s question, but Defendant Arnold \nJones responded by placing Lowery under arrest, purportedly for “failure to obey” an \norder to cease loitering.  This arrest was made without probable cause or legal \njustification. \n87.  Officers Newkirk and Arnold Jones then drove Lowery down the block to \nwhere Stoner, having obeyed Newkirk’s earlier order to “keep walking,” was walking \nwith his party.  The officers then arrested Stoner as well. \n88.  Stoner’s arrest was also purportedly for “failure to obey” an order to \ncease loitering.  This arrest was made without probable cause or legal justification. \n89.  Stoner and Lowery were both subjected to pat-down searches, which \nrevealed they were carrying no contraband or weapons. \n2 0 \n\n90.  Medina, who had been issued a warning citation for loitering, and the \nother four members of the original group were permitted to continue walking back to \nthe hotel. \n91.  Stoner and Lowery were transported to CBIC, where they were \nprocessed and subjected to another pat-down search that revealed them to be free of \ncontraband and weapons. \n92.  Despite the negative results of the searches, Defendant Corrections \nOfficers Doe E and Doe F subjected Stoner and Lowery to humiliating public strip \nsearches at CBIC. \n93.  Stoner and Lowery, along with two other detainees, were ordered to strip \nto their underpants while the officers conducted the search. \n94.  The searches were conducted without probable cause or individualized \nsuspicion that either Stoner or Lowery was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband. \n95.  Indeed, no contraband was found in the possession of either Stoner or \nLowery during the search. \n96.  Both Stoner and Lowery were held in small, filthy, and overcrowded cells \nthat were packed with other detainees.  Both Stoner and Lowery were forced to sit or \ncrouch in uncomfortable positions on filthy floors for long periods of time because of \nthe overcrowded conditions. \n97.  Stoner and Lowery were released from CBIC at approximately 8:00 p.m. \non May 8, after being detained for 17 hours. \n98.  Neither Stoner nor Lowery was ever prosecuted for any crime or brought \nbefore a court commissioner.  \n2 1 \n\nB.  The Police Department’s Illegal Practices \n99.  The experiences of these individual plaintiffs are not unique.  They stem \nfrom a broader policy and practice by the Police Department of arresting persons \nwithout probable cause in order to satisfy performance goals and to show progress in \nfighting crime by means of high arrest numbers. \n100.  Under the direction and oversight of the Commissioner and Deputy \nCommissioner, the Police Department has used a “performance evaluation system” \nthat demands that officers make a large number of arrests, regardless of the number \nor success of resulting prosecutions.  Each patrol officer is required to tally his \nenforcement statistics, including citations and arrests.  These numbers are then \ncompared to averages from that officer’s squad and shift.  The three officers in each \ndistrict with the lowest scores are subject to reassignment to other districts. \n101.  Police officers generally disfavor reassignment because it can greatly \ndisrupt their personal and professional lives. \n102.  Upon information and belief, the Police Department has a policy by \nwhich no automatic disciplinary action is taken against a police officer if a plaintiff \nsucceeds in a civil case challenging the conduct of the officer. \n103.  Upon information and belief the Police Department has no practice of \nreviewing arrests to see whether they result in successful prosecutions, nor of \nreviewing arrest reports in those cases that are not prosecuted to determine whether \nofficers had sufficient probable cause for the arrest or charge. \n2 2 \n\n104.  These policies create perverse incentives for police officers by rewarding \nthose officers who arrest innocent bystanders and punishing those who respect their \nobligations to the City and the public.   \n105.  These perverse incentives are unavoidable because, under the \n“performance evaluation system,” all arrests are counted—even those made with no \nbasis for probable cause. \n106.  Thus, under this system, an officer will not be reassigned even if every \nsingle one of his arrests is made without probable cause, so long as his volume of \narrests is not among the three lowest in his district.  By contrast, a different officer \nwhose volume of arrests is the third lowest in his district will be reassigned even if all \nof his arrestees were convicted.   \n107.  The system therefore encourages all officers to make as many arrests \nas possible, regardless of their justification, to avoid transfer. \n108.  As confirmation, State’s Attorney Patricia Jessamy stated at a public \nlegislative hearing on January 4, 2006, that the Police Department routinely and \nincreasingly arrests people without probable cause. \n109.  To exacerbate matters, the Police Department, its Commissioner, its \nDeputy Commissioner, the Mayor, and the City, which all are (and were, at all times \nrelevant to this lawsuit) aware of the Police Department’s pattern and practice of \nillegal arrests, have failed to take adequate steps to abate the pattern and practice, \ndespite their authority to do so.  They have failed to train and supervise police officers \nadequately.  They have not properly encouraged arrests based on probable cause.  \nThey have affirmatively encouraged overly aggressive and unlawful police tactics, by \n2 3 \n\ndirecting supervisors to ensure that officers keep arrest numbers up, in the belief that \na high number of arrests will keep the crime rate down, regardless of the quality of \nthose arrests.  In short, they have made the unconstitutional and illegal conduct \nworse.  \nC.  Grading the Police Department \n110.  Due to the policies and practices described above, the Baltimore Police \nDepartment has severe police accountability problems. \n111.  Baltimore City State’s Attorney’s Office Annual Statistical Reports \nindicate that, in 2005, the Police Department arrested 76,497 individuals without \nwarrants.  Prosecutors declined to charge 25,293 of the arrestees.  Thus, during \n2005, three out of every ten people arrested without warrants in Baltimore City \nwere not prosecuted, based solely on a review of the charging documents by the \nState’s Attorney, prior to any involvement by a defense attorney or any decision by a \ncourt commissioner or judge.  The State’s Attorney has publicly stated that \nprosecutors declined to charge about 30% of the arrestees in 2005 because, in the \nState’s view, the case was “legally insufficient.” \n112.  In 2005, prosecutors indicated that they could not prove charges against \n7,510 people arrested for loitering, impeding, or obstructing pedestrian traffic during \nthat year.  Those arrests account for nearly 10% of all warrantless arrests in Baltimore \nfor that year.   \n113.  During 2005, prosecutors indicated that they could not prove charges \nagainst 1,832 persons arrested for trespassing and 1,650 persons arrested for \n2 4 \n\ndisorderly conduct/failure to obey/disturbing the peace.  Together, these arrests \naccount for nearly another 5% of all warrantless arrests in Baltimore for that year. \n114.  Thus, prosecutors indicated that they could not prove charges against \nthose persons arrested for often vague “quality of life” offenses in 2005, which \namounted to nearly 15% of the persons arrested without a warrant during that year. \nD.  The Effects of the Police Department’s Arrest Policy on CBIC \n115.  The Police Department’s pattern and practice of encouraging large \nnumbers of illegal arrests causes a backlog at CBIC that leads CBIC to perform \nunconstitutional strip searches and to subject arrestees to overcrowded conditions \nand extended detentions.  \n116.  CBIC was designed to handle about 60,000 bookings each year and to \naccommodate 895 arrestees at any one time.  Because of the Police Department’s \narrest policies, it now handles more than 100,000 bookings each year and regularly \nholds more than 1,200 arrestees at any one time.  Defendant Smith has characterized \nthe problems at CBIC as a “systems overload.”  The overcrowding at CBIC has led to \ntwo distinct problems. \n117.  First, CBIC regularly subjects all male arrestees to public strip searches, \nwithout individualized suspicion and regardless of the arrestees’ charges.  Often, \nthese strip searches are humiliating, non-private body cavity searches.  Most of these \nsearches are not reasonably related to any legitimate security interest or to any \nreasonable suspicion of concealed contraband. \n118.  Second, the backlog causes CBIC to delay, in some cases, presentment \nof arrestees beyond the twenty-four hour maximum established in Maryland Rule 4-\n2 5 \n\n212(f).  In some cases, detainees have been held at CBIC more than forty-eight hours \nbefore presentment.  CBIC makes no adequate effort to structure its systems so that it \ncan timely process all detainees even though CBIC officials are aware of its \ndeficiencies.  Indeed, a consultant’s report to the State in October 2005 stated that “no \none [is] in charge” of ensuring the prompt processing of detainees at CBIC. \n119.  The Warden, Commissioner of Pretrial Services, Secretary, and State \ncondone, affirmatively encourage, or knowingly fail to address these two policies and \npractices at CBIC, despite their responsibility to address them through proper \ntraining, supervising, monitoring, and disciplining of staff or through the formulating, \nimplementing, and executing of appropriate policies. \nE.  The Effects of the Police Department’s Arrest Policy on the Arrestees. \n120.  These illegal arrests, searches, and detentions traumatize arrestees. \n121.  Individuals who are illegally arrested suffer humiliation and degradation \nwhen they are being dragged away in handcuffs in front of their friends, family, or \nneighbors.  The stigma of being illegally arrested can follow an arrestee for years, in \npart because those who know an arrestee are unlikely to forget the sight of the \narrestee being hauled away in handcuffs in the back of a police car. \n122.  At CBIC, innocent arrestees are subjected to dehumanizing and \nhumiliating public strip searches that involve stripping down to underwear, pulling \ndown the underwear, and—often—submitting to a visual body cavity search.  The \nsearches are performed in public view and alongside other detainees.  The victims of \nsuch unwarranted invasions of privacy are humiliated, degraded, and stigmatized. \n2 6 \n\n123.  An individual who is arrested is often physically harmed or threatened \nwhile detained at CBIC.  And the threat does not just come from other arrestees.  In \nMay 2005, a detainee was beaten to death by guards at the CBIC.  In the wake of that \nincident, eight CBIC guards were fired and the FBI has opened an investigation.  The \ndetainee’s death was classified as a homicide.   \n124.  While detained at CBIC, an arrestee is held in filthy and overcrowded \nconditions with numerous other arrestees.  Cells are often so crowded that arrestees \nare forced to sleep on the floor.  In some cases, the cells are so crowded that inmates \nmust sit or crouch in uncomfortable positions on unsanitary floors for hours at a time.  \nThe “meals” are inedible. \n125.  An individual who is illegally arrested also suffers the loss of his liberty \nfor hours or days.  Such detention can result in a detainee losing his job when he fails \nto appear at work and may also harm relations with family if an individual is unable to \nmeet family obligations while illegally detained. \n126.  The presence of an arrest record, even if the arrestee is “released \nwithout charge,” can follow an individual for years, making it difficult to obtain jobs, \nhousing, or any other opportunity that may require a criminal background check. \n127.  Moreover, it is virtually impossible for an arrestee to get the record of his \narrest expunged unless he either (a) waives his right to sue the City or State entities \nresponsible for his arrest and detention or (b) brings a lawsuit against the City or \nState—a process that can take years and can cost thousands of dollars.  Thus, these \nillegal arrests force arrestees into a Hobson’s choice of either submitting to the illegal \n2 7 \n\narrest or being saddled with an arrest record that can eliminate professional \nopportunities for years. \n128.  For confirmed criminals, the prospect of spending hours or days in \nCentral Booking, while unpleasant, is a cost of doing business, and does nothing to \ndeter them from their unlawful behavior or to make Baltimore safer.  For innocent \nvictims of these arrest practices, however, being unlawfully arrested can be a life-\nchanging event. \nF.  The City’s and the Police Department’s Response \n129.  Despite these stories and statistics, the City and Police Department \nmake no apologies. \n130.  In response to repeated and persistent complaints by public officials, \nBaltimore community leaders, and community groups with regard to this ongoing \npattern of unlawful arrests, the City and the Police Department have consistently \nrefused to acknowledge that a problem exists. \n131.  Moroever, Mayor and Defendant O’Malley has consistently refused to \nacknowledge that such a problem exists.     \n132.  At a community forum designed to address police practices on January \n4, 2006, Mayor and Defendant O’Malley proposed eliminating oversight by the State’s \nAttorney’s Office of individuals arrested by the Police Department. \n133.  Eliminating the oversight by the State’s Attorney’s Office would obviously \nfail to have any effect on the number of illegal arrests.  Such a proposal would \nsucceed at one thing, however – it would hide from the public the thousands of illegal \narrests made by the Police Department without probable cause. \n2 8 \n\nVII.  CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n134.  Pursuant to Rule 2-231 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure, Plaintiffs \nHoward, Braxton, Wilson, Stoner, and Lowery move the Court to declare and certify a \nclass of individuals, as described below. \n135.  The class is composed of arrestees who were (1) arrested by the Police \nDepartment without probable cause and (2) released without charges after being \nbooked at CBIC.  The class seeks injunctive, declaratory, and other equitable relief \nonly. \n136.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members would be \nimpracticable.  More than 21,000 individuals were arrested and released without \ncharges after booking in Baltimore during the period from April 2004 to March 2005 \nalone.  Upon information and belief, most of these 21,000 individuals were arrested \nwithout probable cause.  Joinder of thousands of class members would be \nimpracticable. \n137.  Numerous questions of law and fact are common to the class, including \nthe following: \na.  Whether the Police Department has a policy and practice of \narresting persons without probable cause  \nb.  Whether such a policy and practice violates the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and Articles 24 \nand 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights; \nc.  Whether the Police Department encourages illegal arrests by \npunishing officers who make fewer arrests than their colleagues \nor by rewarding officers who make more arrests than their \ncolleagues, regardless of the outcome of those arrests; \n2 9 \n\nd.  Whether such policy violates the Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution, and Articles 24 and 26 of \nthe Maryland Declaration of Rights; \ne.  Whether Defendants were deliberately indifferent to the rights of \narrestees; and \nf.  What nature and scope of equitable relief is warranted by \nDefendants’ conduct. \n \n138.  The claims of the individual Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the \nclass.  Each of the individual Plaintiffs was (1) arrested by the Police Department \nwithout probable cause and (2) released without charges after being booked at CBIC. \n139.  The individual Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \nthe members of the class and have retained counsel who are competent and \nexperienced in complex class action and civil rights litigation.  The Plaintiffs have no \ninterests that are contrary to or that conflict with those of the class. \n140.  Defendants the State, Secretary Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden \nFranks, the City, the Police Department, Mayor O’Malley, Commissioner Hamm, and \nDeputy Commissioner Brown have acted or refused to act on grounds that are \ngenerally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or \ncorresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole. \n141.  The Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that will be encountered in the \nmanagement of this litigation that would preclude its maintenance as a class action, \nand the class action is superior to any other available means to resolve the issues \nraised on behalf of the class. \n3 0 \n\nVIII.  CAUSES OF ACTION \nA.  Count I: Facial and As Applied Challenge to the Loitering Ordinance \nunder the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution and Articles 19, 26, and 40 of the Maryland Declaration of \nRights \n142.  This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n143.  This Count is brought by the individual Plaintiffs Howard, Braxton, \nWilson, Lowery, and Stoner and the NAACP against the City. \n144.  This is an “as applied” challenge to the enforcement of the Loitering \nOrdinance, Baltimore, Md., Police Ordinances art. 19, § 25-1 (2005).  In the alternative, \nit is a facial challenge to the Loitering Ordinance itself. \n145.  The Police Department has interpreted the Loitering Ordinance \nincorrectly to allow arrests of persons engaged in no wrongdoing merely for standing \non the public sidewalks.  By arresting persons merely for standing, the Police \nDepartment has effectuated a policy of arrests without probable cause that a violation \nof the Loitering Ordinance has occurred in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution and Article 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. \n146.  In the alternative, if the Police Department correctly interprets the \nLoitering Ordinance to permit an arrest when an innocent bystander merely is \nstanding on a public sidewalk, the Loitering Ordinance is unconstitutional on its face \nas a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and \nArticles 19 and 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. \nB.  Count II: Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Violations for \nUnconstitutional Arrests under Section 1983 \n147.  This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n3 1 \n\n148.  This Count is brought by the individual Plaintiffs, the class, and the \nNAACP against the City, Mayor O’Malley, the Police Department, Commissioner \nHamm, Deputy Commissioner Brown, Clark, Norris, and Officers Jemini Jones, \nCrites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, and Does 1-100. \n149.  Defendants O’Malley, Hamm, Brown, Clark, Norris, Jemini Jones, Crites, \nPecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, and Does 1-100 are “persons” within the meaning of \n42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n150.  The Defendants violated or caused the violation of the constitutional \nrights of the individual Plaintiffs and of the class members. \n151.  Officers Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, and Does \n1-100 directly violated the constitutional rights of the individual Plaintiffs by arresting \nthem without probable cause and under an illegal pattern and practice. \n152.  The City, Mayor O’Malley, the Police Department, Commissioner Hamm, \nDeputy Commissioner Brown, Clark, and Norris caused these and other similar \nconstitutional violations by implementing, following, or failing to remedy the illegal \npattern or practice. \n153.  The City, Mayor O’Malley, the Police Department, Commissioner Hamm, \nand Deputy Commissioner Brown will continue to cause similar constitutional \nviolations by implementing, following, or failing to remedy the illegal pattern or practice \nin the future. \n154.  It is clearly established now and was clearly established at the time of \ntheir actions that the conduct, patterns, and practices of the Defendants violate the \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. \n3 2 \n\n155.  As an actual and proximate result of Defendants’ conduct, patterns, and \npractices, Plaintiffs and the class members suffered damages. \n156.  In addition, because the conduct, patterns, and practices are ongoing, it \nis likely that Plaintiffs, class members, and NAACP members will suffer damages as \nan actual and proximate result of similar unconstitutional conduct, patterns, and \npractices in the future. \nC.  Count III: Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Violations for \nUnconstitutional Strip Searches under Section 1983 \n157.  This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n158.  This Count is brought by the individual Plaintiffs and the NAACP against \nSecretary Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, Murphy, and Officer Does A-F \nin their individual capacities.  In addition, Defendants Saar, Smith, and Franks are \nsued in their official capacity for declaratory and prospective injunctive relief.  These \ndefendants are therefore “persons” within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n159.  The Defendants violated or caused the violation of the constitutional \nrights of the individual Plaintiffs. \n160.  Officer Does A-F directly violated the constitutional rights of the individual \nPlaintiffs by conducting indiscriminate, non-private, visual strip searches of them, \nwithout probable cause or individualized suspicion to believe they possessed \nweapons or contraband. \n161.  The policy of strip searching, without individualized suspicion, every \nperson arrested for loitering or other “quality of life” offenses is not necessary to \nprotect officer safety, to preserve evidence, or to ensure prison security. \n3 3 \n\n162.  Secretary Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, and Murphy, with \ndeliberate indifference to the individual Plaintiffs’ legal rights, established, \nimplemented, enforced, or failed to remedy an illegal and unconstitutional policy and \npractice at CBIC of conducting indiscriminate, non-private, visual strip searches of \npersons temporarily detained at the center, without probable cause or individualized \nsuspicion to believe the detainees possessed weapons or contraband. \n163.  It is clearly established now and was clearly established at the time of \ntheir actions that the conduct, patterns, and practices of the Defendants violate the \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. \n164.  As an actual and proximate result of Defendants’ conduct, patterns, and \npractices, the individual Plaintiffs suffered damages.  \n165.  In addition, because the conduct, patterns, and practices are ongoing, it \nis likely that the individual Plaintiffs and NAACP members will suffer damages as an \nactual and proximate result of similar unconstitutional conduct, patterns, and \npractices in the future. \nD.

This Count is brought by Plaintiffs Howard and Braxton against Secretary \nSaar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, and Murphy.  In this Count, these \nDefendants are sued in their individual capacities only.  They are therefore “persons” \nwithin the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n168.  The Defendants violated or caused the violation of the constitutional \nrights of Plaintiffs Howard and Braxton. \n3 4 \n\n169.  Secretary Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, and Murphy, with \ndeliberate indifference to Howard’s and Braxton’s legal rights, established, \nimplemented, enforced, condoned, and failed to remedy the conduct, pattern, and \npractice at CBIC of holding detainees for more than twenty-four hours without \ncharges, presentment, or release. \n170.  It was clearly established at the time of their actions that such conduct, \npatterns, and practices violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution. \n171.  As an actual and proximate result of Defendants’ conduct, pattern, and \npractice, Plaintiffs Howard and Braxton suffered damages. \nE.  Court V: Common Law Claim for Violations of Article 26 of the \nMaryland Declaration of Rights for Unconstitutional Arrests \n172.  This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n173.

A common-law private cause of action exists to remedy Maryland \nconstitutional violations through both injunctive relief and money damages. \n175.  Officers Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, and Does \n1-100 directly violated the constitutional rights of the individual Plaintiffs and the class \nmembers by arresting them without probable cause and under an illegal pattern and \npractice. \n3 5 \n\n176.  The City, Mayor O’Malley, the Police Department, Commissioner Hamm, \nDeputy Commissioner Brown, Clark, and Norris caused these and other similar \nconstitutional violations by implementing, following, or failing to remedy the illegal \npattern or practice. \n177.  The City, Mayor O’Malley, the Police Department, Commissioner Hamm, \nand Deputy Commissioner Brown will continue to cause similar constitutional \nviolations by implementing, following, or failing to remedy the illegal pattern or practice \nin the future. \n178.  The Defendants’ conduct, patterns, and practices violate Article 26 of the \nMaryland Declaration of Rights. \n179.  Their conduct, patterns, and practices were made with malice, ill will, \nimproper motive, and gross negligence. \n180.  As an actual and proximate result of Defendants’ conduct, patterns, and \npractices, the individual Plaintiffs and the class members suffered damages. \n181.

The conduct, patterns, and practices of strip searching without \nindividualized suspicion every arrestee brought to CBIC is not necessary to protect \nofficer safety, to preserve evidence, or to ensure prison security. \n187.  The Defendants’ conduct, patterns, and practices were made with \nmalice, ill will, improper motive, and gross negligence. \n188.

      "text": "Case 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 63   Filed 12/01/06   Page 1 of 5\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\nMARYLAND STATE CONFERENCE :\nOF NAACP BRANCHES, ET AL. :\n:\nv. : CIVIL NO. CCB-06-1863\n:\nBALTIMORE CITY POLICE :\nDEPARTMENT, ET AL. :\n...o0o...\nMEMORANDUM\nThe complaint in this case asserts various constitutional and state law claims against the\nBaltimore City Police Department (“BPD”), the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (“City”),\nthe Mayor individually, current and former BPD commissioners, and individual police officers,\ncollectively “the City defendants”, for allegedly unlawful arrests (Counts 2, 5, 8, 9, 12).  It also\nasserts claims against the State of Maryland, the Secretary of the Department of Public Safety\nand Correctional Services, the Commissioner of the Division of Pretrial Detention, current and\nformer wardens at the Central Booking and Intake Center (“CBIC”), and CBIC officers,\ncollectively “the State defendants”,  for allegedly unlawful strip searches and “over detentions”\nat CBIC (Counts 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14).  Further, Count 1 asserts against the City a claim\nthat the Baltimore City loitering ordinance is unconstitutional as applied, or in the alternative\nunconstitutional on its face.  The complaint seeks certification for a class consisting of “arrestees\nwho were (1) arrested by the Police Department without probable cause and (2) released without\ncharges after being booked at CBIC.”  (Compl. ¶ 135.)   The plaintiffs, who seek only equitable\nand not monetary relief for the class, have not formally moved for class certification at this time.\nThe State defendants have answered the complaint; the City defendants have filed a\nmotion to dismiss or for summary judgment and a motion to certify to the Maryland Court of\n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 63   Filed 12/01/06   Page 2 of 5\nAppeals the question of the constitutionality of the loitering ordinance.  These issues have been\nfully briefed.\nFirst, the City defendants request that I deny the request for class certification, pointing\nto the lack of an identified unlawful policy uniformly applicable to the proposed class and to the\nneed to determine whether there was probable cause for each allegedly unlawful arrest, “an\nindividualized and fact specific inquiry” (Defs.’ Mem. at 18) that would make the proposed class\nunsuitable for certification.  More specifically, the defendants identify three theories they\nattribute to the plaintiffs on which class certification might be based: (1) that arrests for certain\n“quality of life” crimes are categorically illegal; (2) that the decision of the State’s Attorney not\nto prosecute certain crimes establishes that arrests for those crimes were unlawful; and (3) that\nthe use of a performance evaluation system for police officers based on the number of arrests is\nunlawful.  (Defs.’ Reply Mem. at 12-13.)  The City defendants argue strongly, however, that\nnone of these theories, even if supported by the facts, is legally correct, as neither a prosecutor’s\ndecision not to prosecute nor a performance evaluation system based on arrests would render\nunlawful an arrest supported by probable cause.  (Defs.’ Mem. at 14-15.)\nIn response, the plaintiffs point out that they have not yet moved for class certification\nand may not do so, although they appear to maintain that class certification is appropriate based\non allegations that “the police department, at the direction of the Mayor, engaged in a systematic\npractice of arresting individuals without probable cause for certain categories of offenses.”  (Pls.’\nOpp’n Mem. at 3-4, 15.)  I am skeptical about the viability of certifying a class as apparently\nproposed, but agree with the plaintiffs that it would be premature to rule when no motion has\nbeen filed.\n2\n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 63   Filed 12/01/06   Page 3 of 5\nIn light of the justifiable concerns raised by the City defendants, however, the plaintiffs\nwill be required to make their decision about whether to seek certification at an “early\npracticable time”.  Further, these concerns may affect the scope of discovery.  While the\ndefendants agree that the plaintiffs may legitimately seek discovery about policies of the City\nand the BPD in connection with their individual claims (Defs.’ Reply Mem. at 22), broader class\ndiscovery may not be permitted in the absence of the plaintiffs’ demonstrating that they have a\nviable class to propose.\nSecond, the defendants apparently argue that all claims against the City and the Mayor\nshould be dismissed, citing Clea v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 312 Md. 662, 541\nA.2d 1303 (1988) and Chin, et al. v. City of Baltimore, et al., 241 F. Supp. 2d 546 (D. Md. 2003)\n(Blake, J.).  See Defs.’ Mem. at 32-4, 37, 40; Defs.’ Reply Mem. at 25-26.  It is not necessary\nand would be premature to decide the full scope of these cases at this time, before the plaintiffs\nhave an opportunity to establish claims against the City and the Mayor for their own actions. \n(Pls.’ Opp’n Mem. at 35-6, 38-41.)  On the other hand, there appears to be little dispute1 that the\nBPD is entitled to sovereign immunity from claims for monetary damages, but not equitable\nrelief,2 under state law, and that the City is entitled to governmental immunity for the common\n1 The defendants initially assert that the BPD has sovereign immunity in all tort actions,\nboth common law and constitutional, and that the City enjoys governmental immunity when\nacting in a governmental capacity.  (Defs.’ Mem. at 36-37, 39.)  The plaintiffs do not contest the\nBPD’s immunity for damages in any tort action nor do they dispute the City’s governmental\nimmunity, but they argue that they can obtain equitable relief from the BPD for its constitutional\ntorts.  (Pls.’ Opp’n Mem. 37-38, 42.)  The defendants in turn do not dispute this point, thereby\nreaching agreement on the scope of immunities accorded to the BPD and the City.  (Defs.’ Reply\nMem. 24-25.) \n2 I am not currently ruling on whether the plaintiffs will ultimately be found to have\nstanding to obtain injunctive relief.  \n3\n\nCase 1:06-cv-01863-CCB   Document 63   Filed 12/01/06   Page 4 of 5\nlaw torts asserted in the complaint.  See Baltimore Police Department, et al. v. Cherkes, 140 Md.\nApp. 282, 780 A.2d 410, 426, 429, 436 (Ct. Spec. App. 2001). \nThird, the City defendants have asked for dismissal or summary judgment on the\nindividual plaintiffs’ claims for unlawful arrest.  That will be denied.3  The claims plainly are\nsufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, and it would be premature to grant summary\njudgment in the face of conflicting affidavits involving what the defendants agree is an\n“individualized and fact specific inquiry” into probable cause.4  Similarly, it would be premature\nto decide whether any individual defendant is entitled to qualified immunity before development\nof the particular facts against which the defense must be evaluated.\nFinally, I will deny without prejudice the motion to certify.  The plaintiffs initially make\nan “as applied” challenge to the enforcement of the loitering ordinance, arguing that the BPD has\ninterpreted it incorrectly to allow an arrest of persons “engaged in no wrongdoing merely for\nstanding on the public sidewalks.”  (Compl. ¶ 145.)  Discovery into the claims of the individual\nplaintiffs may illuminate whether the BPD is in fact applying such an interpretation and may\naffect the scope and necessity of certification.  While I agree with the defendants that\ncertification may be justified to obtain an authoritative construction of a state law before a\nfederal court rules on its constitutionality, see PSINet, Inc. v. Chapman, 317 F.3d 415, 424-25\n(4th Cir.  2003); NAACP Anne Arundel County Branch v. City of Annapolis, 133 F. Supp. 2d\n3 I will permit the City to file its motion to dismiss or for summary judgment as to\nplaintiff Evan Howard, but deny the motion for summary judgment and deny in part and grant in\npart the motion to dismiss for the same reasons set forth in the body of this memo.\n4 Indeed, the defendants concede material factual disputes exist as to plaintiffs Stoner and\nLowrey.

INTRODUCTION \n1.  Under a pattern and practice set and enforced by city officials, Baltimore police \nofficers arrest individuals without probable cause, in violation of the U.S. Constitution and the \nMaryland Declaration of Rights. \n2.  To encourage this pattern and practice, the Baltimore City Police Department \n(\"Police Department\") rewards police officers with more arrests and punishes officers with \nfewer arrests, regardless of the number or success of resulting prosecutions. \n2  \n\n3.  As a consequence, Baltimore prosecutors decided to drop the charges against \napproximately 30 percent of those arrested without a warrant in 2005 prior to any involvement \nby a defense attorney, and prior to review of the charges by a court commissioner. \n4.  The Maryland Central Booking and Intake Center (\"CBIC\") receives these \narrestees for processing, and compounds the problem by conducting strip searches of male \narrestees without probable cause or individualized suspicion that they are carrying weapons \nor contraband, in violation of the U.S. Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights. \n5.  The volume of arrests by the Police Department has caused CBIC to detain many \narrestees beyond the statutory time limit of 24 hours before presentment or release, in \nviolation of Maryland Rule 4-212(f) and the Maryland Declaration of Rights.  In some cases, \nthe detentions have exceeded 48 hours, in violation of the U.S. Constitution. \n6.  These unconstitutional and illegal acts degrade, humiliate, and cause grave harm \nto their victims.  Individuals who are arrested suffer unwarranted deprivation of personal \nliberty, sometimes for days.  They may lose their jobs or be denied job opportunities in the \nfuture as a result of the permanent stigma of having a criminal charge on their record.  They \nsuffer the humiliation of being hauled away in handcuffs in front of friends, family, or \nneighbors.  At CBIC, they are subjected to the degradation of strip searches—in many \ncases, visual body cavity searches—in front of other detainees.  They are detained, \nsometimes for days at a time, in filthy, overcrowded conditions.  Then, when the State's \nAttorney declines to prosecute, they are Released Without Charge (RWOC'd), though they \nhave technically already been charged by the police—often because the police had no right \nto arrest them in the first place. \n3  \n\n7.  Despite the patently unconstitutional and illegal nature of this conduct and its \ndetrimental effects on the Baltimore residents whom the laws are supposed to protect, city \nofficials have refused to reform their practices.  The time has come to rein in this abuse of \npower and stop these unconstitutional and illegal acts. \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  This Court has jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1331. \n9.  Venue is proper as the events complained of occurred in the Northern Division of \nthe District of Maryland, and the defendants carry out business therein. \n10. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants State of Maryland (\"State\"), \nthe Mayor and City Council of the City of Baltimore (\"City\"), and the Police Department \nbecause they are entities consisting of or located within Maryland. \n11. This Court also has personal jurisdiction over individual Defendants Maynard, \nSaar, Smith, Franks, Murphy, O'Malley, Dixon, Hamm, Brown, Bealefeld, Clark, Norris, Jemini \nJones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Heron, Grey, Chin, Southard, Pinkosz, \nHamilton, Mealey, Officer Does A-R, and Officer Does 1-100.  Upon information and belief, \nMaynard, Saar, Smith, Franks, Murphy, Dixon, O'Malley, Hamm, Brown, Bealefeld, Jemini \nJones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Heron, Grey, Chin, Southard, Pinkosz, \nHamilton, Mealey, Officer Does A-R, and Officer Does 1-100 maintain domiciles within the \nState of Maryland.  In addition, this Court has personal jurisdiction over all of the individual \nDefendants under Maryland's long-arm statute because (a) their tortious actions and \nomissions occurred and caused injury within Maryland and (b) they are (or were at the time \n4  \n\nof the illegal acts) all employed within Maryland, thus performing a character of work or \nservice within Maryland.  \nIII.  PRE-SUIT REQUIREMENTS \n12. Plaintiffs Howard, Lowery, Braxton, Stoner, Wilson, Johnson, Crockett, Horsey, \nLindsay, Marcus, and Chapman have satisfied the necessary pre-suit prerequisites under \nthe Maryland Tort Claims Act and the Local Government Tort Claims Act for each of the \npertinent claims listed below in Section VIII; Plaintiff Higgs has satisfied the necessary \nprerequisites under the Local Government Tort Claims Act; and Plaintiffs Scott and Wright \nhave satisfied the necessary prerequisites under the Maryland Tort Claims Act. \n13.

ALLEGATIONS OF FACT \nA.  The Experiences of the Individual Plaintiffs \n1.  The Illegal Arrests and Searches of Plaintiffs Howard and Braxton \n73. At approximately 8:30 p.m. on Friday, April 15, 2005, Plaintiff Evan Howard was \nstanding on the sidewalk that runs past his home on Poplar Grove Street in Baltimore, about \na block away from his front door, engaging in conversation with Plaintiff Tyrone Braxton and \nanother friend, Correy Alexander. \n74. After a few minutes, Defendant Officers Jemini Jones and Doe 1 pulled up behind \nBraxton's car in an unmarked police cruiser.  The plainclothes officers approached the three \nfriends and asked if they had any information about a recent homicide. \n75. The officers then asked Howard, Braxton, and Alexander their ages.  After revealing \nthat he was a minor, Alexander was ordered to go home, which he did. \n76. Then, without explanation, probable cause, or any legal justification, the officers \nconducted pat-down searches of Howard and Braxton and placed them under arrest.  The \narrests were purportedly for loitering and impeding the flow of pedestrian traffic, even though \nneither Howard nor Braxton had been loitering and the officers had not ordered them to \ndisperse. \n77. Officer Jemini Jones tightly bound the young men's hands with plastic handcuffs \nand placed Howard and Braxton in a vehicle for transport to CBIC. \n78. Howard and Braxton arrived at CBIC at about 10:00 p.m., where they waited for \napproximately an hour to begin the booking process.  Upon entering CBIC, they were \nscreened with a metal detector, which showed that neither carried any weapons. \n2 1 \n\n79. At approximately 11:00 p.m., Howard and Braxton were subjected to humiliating \npublic strip searches by Defendant Officers Doe A and Doe B.  Howard, Braxton, and two \nother detainees were placed in a holding cell, ordered to remove all of their clothing down to \ntheir underpants, face the wall, pull their underpants down to expose their buttocks, and \nsubmit to a visual body cavity search. \n80. The searches were conducted without probable cause or individualized suspicion \nthat either Howard or Braxton was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband. \n81. Indeed, no contraband was found in the possession of either Howard or Braxton \nduring the search. \n82. After the strip search, Howard and Braxton were taken to a small, filthy, and \novercrowded cell, where they stayed with about ten other detainees through the night.  The \ncell had no bathroom and was so overcrowded that both Howard and Braxton were forced to \nsit in uncomfortable positions on filthy floors for long periods of time. \n83. At approximately 8:00 a.m. on Saturday, April 16, Howard and Braxton were taken \nto a slightly larger cell containing about 15 other detainees.  This cell was also filthy and \nunsanitary.  Throughout the day, the number of people in the cell fluctuated, frequently \nswelling to nearly 20.  Once again, both Howard and Braxton were forced to sit in \nuncomfortable positions on filthy floors for long periods of time. \n84. During their confinement, Howard and Braxton were provided \"meals\" in their cells \nthree times each day.  The meals principally consisted of two slices of bread covering shiny \nand slimy meat, which Howard and Braxton believed to be spoiled bologna. \n2 2 \n\n85. Braxton was finally released on Sunday, April 17, at 10:00 a.m., after being held at \nCBIC for 36 hours. \n86. Howard was finally released on Monday, April 18, at 4:00 a.m., after being held at \nCBIC for 54 hours.  Howard, far from home and unable to contact anyone to pick him up from \nCBIC, was forced to walk back to his home in the dark at a dangerous hour of night through \nunfamiliar streets. \n87. Neither Howard nor Braxton was ever prosecuted for any crime or ever brought \nbefore a court commissioner.  \n2.  The Illegal Arrests and Searches of Plaintiff Wilson \n88. On April 10, 2006, Plaintiff Donald Wilson was sitting on the front steps of a \nresidence in which his girlfriend and toddler son live.  He was visiting them and waiting for \nhis younger brother, Darrell. \n89. While Mr. Wilson was sitting on the steps with two friends, an unmarked police \nSubaru raced down the street in pursuit of a dirt bike.  A crowd of approximately 15 neighbors \ngathered along the block to watch the chase. \n90. Failing to catch the bicyclist, the maroon police Subaru pulled up to the residence \nand Officer Crites and Sergeant Pecha exited the vehicle.  Officer Crites yelled, \"Everybody sit \nthe f**k down!\"  Everyone in the area obeyed.  Wilson, at the time, was already sitting down. \n91. The officers began questioning the group of people, asking them where they lived \nand what they were doing there.  Most were patted down and asked to show identification.  \nWilson provided his identification when requested. \n2 3 \n\n92. Crites questioned Wilson and asked whether Wilson lived there.  When Wilson \nfirmly responded in the affirmative, Crites took offense and, in a low tone of voice, threatened \nto \"f**k [him] up.\" \n93. When Wilson responded to this threat, by observing that Crites had whispered his \nthreat rather than stating it aloud in front of witnesses, Crites immediately ordered Wilson to \nstand up.  Wilson asked why, and Crites responded, \"Don't f**king say nothing to me,\" and \nordered Wilson to stand up and put his hands behind his back. \n94. Wilson complied and asked why he was being arrested.  Crites responded, \"Don't \nworry about it.  You're going to jail.\" \n95. Wilson asked Crites for his name and badge number.  Crites replied, \"911.\" \n96. Crites placed metal handcuffs on Wilson and ordered him to sit on the ground.  At \nthat time, two marked police cruisers arrived at the scene, and two additional officers exited \nthose vehicles. \n97. Wilson asked his girlfriend to call his mother, and then he remained calm and \nquiet. \n98. The police began to tell people to leave.  After about 15 minutes, Wilson's mother \narrived.  She politely asked who the officer in charge was.  Sgt. Pecha responded that he \nwas in charge.  Wilson's mother asked what her son was being detained for.  Pecha asked \nfor Wilson's age, and when his mother said, \"21,\" Pecha stated that he did not have to give \nher any information because Wilson was not a minor.  Upon further questioning, Pecha \ncontinued to refuse to explain why Wilson was arrested. \n2 4 \n\n99. Wilson's mother therefore went to talk with her son, who explained what had \nhappened.  After about two minutes, Pecha came over and told her that she had to leave or \nshe would be arrested.  When she asked for Pecha's name and badge number, Pecha \nignored her. \n100.  Crites and Pecha did not have nametags on and their badges were tucked \ninside their shirts to hide identifying information. \n101.  Crites put Wilson in the police car and transported him to CBIC at \napproximately 9:15 p.m. \n102.  At CBIC, Wilson was taken to a waiting room, where he was ordered to strip \ndown to his boxers and searched by Officer Does C-D.  A Latino man next to him in the same \nroom was completely naked. \n103.  The search was conducted without probable cause or individualized suspicion \nthat Wilson was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband.  Indeed, no contraband was found \nin his possession. \n104.  Wilson was finally released from CBIC at around 2:00 a.m. the next day.  He \nwas not allowed to use a phone at CBIC, so he walked to the nearest pay phone to call his \nmother. \n105.  Wilson was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court \ncommissioner. \n106.  On April 5, 2007 in the late afternoon, Donald Wilson visited a friend on \nAbbottston Road.  After some time at the friend's house, Wilson and his friend left to return to \n2 5 \n\nWilson's house.  The friend's mother called her son back in just as the two men were \nleaving the house.  Wilson stood outside waiting for his friend to rejoin him. \n107.  As Wilson was waiting for this friend and was tying his shoe with his foot on the \nstoop of the neighboring property, two uniformed officers and a plain-clothes officer \napproached him.  The officers demanded to know why he was standing where he was.  \nWilson explained that he was waiting for his friend. \n108.  Unsatisfied, the officers interrogated Wilson as to whether he had drugs on \nhim, where his friends were, and other subjects.  The officers searched Wilson, patting him \ndown and searching his pockets.  No weapons, drugs or contraband were found by this \nsearch.  Wilson told the officers that he was not carrying drugs, and indicated that he was \noffended that they seemed to assume that he was a drug dealer.  A uniformed officer took \nWilson's identification.  \n109.  Several minutes after the police arrived, Wilson's friend came out of his house \nand asked the officers what was going on.  The officers told him to go back into his house, \nwhich he did.  Wilson's friend watched the arrest from his window. \n110.  After Wilson was searched, the plain-clothes officer handcuffed Wilson, telling \nhim that he was being arrested for \"getting smart.\" \n111.  In fact, Wilson was charged with trespass on posted property, but at all times \nrelevant hereto, the property was not posted with any no-trespassing signs. \n112.  Wilson asked the arresting officer for his name, but the officer ignored the \nrequest. \n2 6 \n\n113.  Wilson was transported to the Eastern District police station in a paddy wagon, \nwhere he was interrogated by a police detective concerning gangs and shootings.  Wilson \nhad no information related to the detective's questions and told him so. \n114.  Wilson was then taken to Central Booking, arriving at approximately 6:00 p.m.   \n115.  He asked the intake officer for the arresting officer's name but the request was \nrefused. \n116.  Wilson was then subjected to a humiliating strip search by Officer Doe L.  In \nfront of another prisoner, who had been forced to undress completely, Wilson was forced to \npull his pants down to his ankles and to allow the officer to look inside his underwear \nwaistband.  He was also made to lift his shirt for the officer.   \n117.  Officer Doe L told Wilson that his arrest was part of the BPD's \"low tolerance\" \npolicy.   \n118.  The searches were conducted without probable cause or individualized \nsuspicion that Wilson was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband.  No contraband was \nfound in this search. \n119.  Wilson was then confined at CIBC.  He shuttled between four different cells, \nwhich were so crowded that Wilson was often forced to sit or lie on the concrete floor.   \n120.  Wilson was released at approximately 3:30 a.m. on April 6, 2007, after being \ndetained for approximately nine and one half hours.  \n121.  Wilson was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court \ncommissioner. \n2 7 \n\n3.  The Illegal Arrests and Searches of Plaintiffs Stoner and Lowery \n122.  On May 7, 2005, Plaintiff Aaron Stoner, Plaintiff Robert Lowery, Walter Medina, \nJr., and four other friends and co-workers visited the city of Baltimore to celebrate Stoner's \nupcoming wedding.  After visiting the Inner Harbor, the group of friends left on foot in the early \nmorning hours of May 8 to return to their hotel. \n123.  While walking back to their hotel, a marked police car containing Defendant \nOfficers Newkirk and Arnold Jones drove past.  Newkirk instructed the group to \"keep \nmoving,\" even though the group had not actually paused during the journey.  They obeyed \nand continued to walk back to their hotel. \n124.  About two minutes later, the same patrol car drove past the group.  Medina was \nthe first to see the approaching car, and remarked to Stoner, \"Here comes that cop again.\" \n125.  Officer Newkirk pulled the car to the side, stopped the car, and exited.  Newkirk \nconfronted Medina, the only African-American in the group, demanding, \"What did you say, \nboy?\"  Before Medina could answer, Newkirk pushed him against a wall. \n126.  After Newkirk pushed Medina against the wall and began to aggressively \nquestion him, Stoner verbally protested.  Newkirk then turned toward Stoner and ran at him \nwith his baton fortifying his raised forearm.  Defendant Newkirk hit Stoner with such force as \nto knock Stoner off of his feet. \n127.  Newkirk then instructed Stoner and the other five men to \"keep walking.\"  Stoner \nobeyed by getting up and walking to the rest of the group. \n128.  Newkirk then issued a warning citation for loitering to Medina. \n2 8 \n\n129.  Lowery, upset at the police harassment and brutality he had witnessed, then \nleft the group, approached Officers Newkirk and Arnold Jones, and asked for Newkirk's \nname and badge number. \n130.  Newkirk refused to answer Lowery's question, but Defendant Arnold Jones \nresponded by placing Lowery under arrest, purportedly for \"failure to obey\" an order to cease \nloitering.  This arrest was made without probable cause or legal justification. \n131.  Officers Newkirk and Arnold Jones then drove Lowery down the block to where \nStoner, having obeyed Newkirk's earlier order to \"keep walking,\" was walking with his party.  \nThe officers then arrested Stoner as well. \n132.  Stoner's arrest was also purportedly for \"failure to obey\" an order to cease \nloitering.  This arrest was made without probable cause or legal justification. \n133.  Stoner and Lowery were both subjected to pat-down searches, which revealed \nthey were carrying no contraband or weapons. \n134.  Medina, who had been issued a warning citation for loitering, and the other four \nmembers of the original group were permitted to continue walking back to the hotel. \n135.  Stoner and Lowery were transported to CBIC, where they were processed and \nsubjected to another pat-down search that revealed them to be free of contraband and \nweapons. \n136.  Despite the negative results of the searches, Defendant Corrections Officers \nDoe E and Doe F subjected Stoner and Lowery to humiliating public strip searches at CBIC. \n137.  Stoner and Lowery, along with two other detainees, were ordered to strip to \ntheir underpants while the officers conducted the search. \n2 9 \n\n138.  The searches were conducted without probable cause or individualized \nsuspicion that either Stoner or Lowery was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband. \n139.  Indeed, no contraband was found in the possession of either Stoner or Lowery \nduring the search. \n140.  Both Stoner and Lowery were held in small, filthy, and overcrowded cells that \nwere packed with other detainees.  Both Stoner and Lowery were forced to sit or crouch in \nuncomfortable positions on filthy floors for long periods of time because of the overcrowded \nconditions. \n141.  Stoner and Lowery were released from CBIC at approximately 8:00 p.m. on May \n8, after being detained for 17 hours. \n142.  Neither Stoner nor Lowery was ever prosecuted for any crime or brought before \na court commissioner.  \n4.  The Illegal Arrest and Search of Timothy Johnson \n143.  In the early morning hours of June 25, 2006, Timothy Johnson and three \nacquaintances were walking down the street towards their hotel, the Baltimore Waterfront \nMarriott.   \n144.  Johnson and his three colleagues were in Baltimore to attend the Annual \nScientific Meeting of the Research Society on Alcoholism. \n145.  While walking down the street, Johnson and his acquaintances encountered a \nwoman whom they did not know, who was walking in the same direction.  Because they \nwere traveling in the same direction, the five pedestrians would have appeared to be a \nsingle group. \n3 0 \n\n146.  Concerned that the woman should not be walking alone late at night in the \narea, and assuming that she was a fellow attendee at the conference, one of Johnson's \ncolleagues told the woman that they were walking back to the hotel and asked if she wanted \nto walk with them. \n147.  A marked police cruiser then drove up and stopped near the group, and one \nofficer asked if everything was okay.  Some members of the group responded, \"Yes.\" \n148.  The officer then asked, referring to the woman who had just joined the group, \n\"Is she with you?\"  One of Johnson's acquaintances informed the officer that the woman had \njust joined them. \n149.  The officer then began questioning the woman, who responded to his \nquestions while continuing to walk.  The officer exited his vehicle, ordered the woman to \nstop, and then directed Johnson and his friends to keep walking. \n150.  The group continued walking, although they were concerned for the well-being \nof the woman, who kept saying that she just wanted to go back to the hotel. \n151.  At the end of the block, Johnson turned around to see the officer handcuffing \nthe woman. \n152.  While Johnson was waiting to cross the street, the officer yelled for Johnson to \ncome back, and Johnson complied. \n153.  Johnson had not said a word to the officer, nor had he said anything loudly \nabout the officer or about the situation.  He assumed that he would be questioned about the \nwoman or would be a witness to the arrest. \n3 1 \n\n154.  At that time, another uniformed officer and two plainclothes officers arrived on \nthe scene.  They ordered Johnson to stop, subjected him to a pat-down search, and asked \nhim to sit down on the curb.   \n155.  No contraband was found during the pat-down search. \n156.  The first officer then told the other officers that \"these people were hindering\" \nand that they hadn't moved fast enough.  The officers also joked that they were going to \ndeliver the woman \"back to her boyfriend in chains.\" \n157.  Johnson was then placed under arrest, subjected to a second pat-down \nsearch, and placed in a vehicle bound for Central Booking.  Once again, no contraband was \nfound. \n158.  Johnson was then transported to CBIC, where he was booked and \nfingerprinted. \n159.  Despite the negative results of the previous pat-down searches, Mr. Johnson \nwas subjected to a humiliating strip search by Officer Does G and H, during which he was \nrequired to remove all of his clothing except a T-shirt. \n160.  The search was conducted without probable cause or individualized suspicion \nthat Johnson was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband. \n161.  Indeed, no contraband was found in Johnson's possession during the search. \n162.  After the illegal strip search, Johnson was held with two other men in a small, \nfilthy cell designed for only one detainee.  He was released at 8:30 a.m., after being in \ncustody for approximately six hours. \n3 2 \n\n163.  Johnson's release came a mere thirty minutes before he was scheduled to \ngive a presentation at the Annual Scientific Meeting of the Research Society on Alcoholism, \nthe reason for his trip to Baltimore. \n164.  Johnson was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court \ncommissioner. \n5.  The Illegal Arrests and Searches of Tavis Crockett \n165.  At approximately 5:45 p.m. on July 23, 2006, Tavis Crockett and approximately \nsix other young men from his neighborhood were sitting on the front steps of a friend's \nbuilding, getting ready to watch a neighborhood game of basketball.  \n166.  As the group began to get up and move toward the basketball courts, a number \nof police cruisers pulled up and Officer Grey exited his cruiser. \n167.  Officer Grey asked the group where Brandon was.  Upon information and belief, \nBrandon is a young man in the neighborhood that the police believe to be a drug dealer. \n168.  Brandon was not present, although the young men had seen him walk by \nearlier in the day. \n169.  Upon learning that Brandon was not present, Officer Grey told all seven young \nmen that they were being arrested for loitering.   \n170.  Officer Grey and approximately ten other police officers then took all seven \nyoung men into custody.  All seven boys were subjected to pat-down searches, which \nrevealed no weapons, drugs, or contraband. \n171.  The arrests were not preceded by a warning that the young men were loitering, \nor by a directive to move along. \n3 3 \n\n172.  When the young men arrived at the police station, three of them were let go \nbecause they were juveniles.  Crockett and the other three non-minors were transported to \nCBIC. \n173.  At CBIC, Defendant Corrections Officers Doe I and Doe J subjected Crockett to \na humiliating public strip search. \n174.  Crockett, along with another detainee, was ordered to strip to his underpants \nwhile the officers conducted the search. \n175.  The search was conducted without probable cause or individualized suspicion \nthat Crockett was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband. \n176.  Indeed, no contraband was found in the possession of Crockett during the \nsearch. \n177.  Crockett was held in small, filthy, and overcrowded cells that were packed with \nother detainees. \n178.  Crockett was released from CBIC at approximately 8:00 a.m. on July 24, after \nbeing detained for 14 hours. \n179.  Crockett was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court \ncommissioner. \n180.  On August 22, 2006, at about 8:50 p.m., Crockett was walking from his Aunt's \nhouse to a nearby convenience store near Carey Street and Riggs Avenue in Baltimore, a \ndistance of approximately one block. \n181.  As Crockett walked to the convenience store he was stopped by four plain-\nclothes police officers.   \n3 4 \n\n182.  One of the officers told Crockett, \"Come on, you're going downtown with us.\"  \nCrockett asked the officer why he was being arrested.  The officer told Crockett that he had \nlittered.   \n183.  Crockett told the officer that he was not aware that he had dropped anything, \nand offered to pick up a food wrapper the officer claimed Crockett had dropped.  The officer \ndid not let Crockett pick up the wrapper.   \n184.  Crockett was searched on the sidewalk, and then taken to the Western District \nstation, where he was held in a cell with two other detainees.  He remained in this cell for \nfour hours.  The police denied Crockett's request to call his mother.   \n185.  At approximately midnight, Crockett was transported to CBIC, handcuffed, in a \npaddy wagon.   \n186.  Inside CBIC, Crockett was subjected to a humiliating strip search.  A female \nofficer, Doe M, made Crockett strip to his boxers in front of two other officers and another \ndetainee. \n187.  This strip search was conducted without probable cause or individualized \nsuspicion that Crockett was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband.   \n188.  No contraband was found in the possession of Crockett during the search. \n189.  Crockett was then confined to a cell with ten other detainees where he \nremained for four hours.  After being fingerprinted and photographed, he was confined again \nin another cell. \n3 5 \n\n190.  At approximately 8:15 a.m. on August 23, 2006, Crockett was finally released, \nafter being held for approximately eleven and one half hours.  He did not arrive home until \n9:00 a.m., after a 45-minute public bus trip from CBIC.   \n191.  Crockett was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court \ncommissioner. \n6.  The Illegal Arrests and Searches of Raffic Scott and Kerrell Wright \n192.  At approximately 10:00 p.m. on August 30, 2006 Raffic Scott, Kerrell Wright and \napproximately five fellow members of their church, the Israelite Church of God and Jesus \nChrist, were handing out religious literature on a sidewalk on Belair Road and Erdman \nAvenue in Baltimore.  The church members periodically engage in sidewalk proselytizing to \nspread their religious message.  When doing so, they generally wear distinctive robes that \nsignify their church membership. \n193.  Officers Chin and Southard approached the group in a squad car and \ndemanded to know what they were doing.  Scott responded that he and his group were \nhanding out religious literature.   \n194.  When the police approached, Wright began videotaping the encounter, as is \nthe Church’s practice due to frequent police harassment. \n195.  After demanding that Wright cease video recording, and claiming that it was \nillegal to videotape police officers without permission from the officer or from police \nheadquarters, Officer Chin demanded that Wright produce identification.  In order to do so, \nWright passed the video camera to Scott. \n3 6 \n\n196.  An officer then told Mr. Scott that he had to cease filming.  When Scott refused, \nOfficer Chin told Scott to put his hands on this head and pushed Scott against a wall. \n197.  Officer Chin forcibly removed Scott's religious clothing, throwing his headpiece, \nrobe and belt to the ground.   \n198.  Scott was searched on the scene.  This search revealed no drugs, weapons, or \ncontraband.   \n199.  Wright was also arrested.  He was thrown to the ground and had his religious \nclothing removed and also thrown to the ground. \n200.  Wright was searched on the scene.  This search revealed no drugs, weapons, \nor contraband.   \n201.  As Scott and Wright were being arrested, approximately eight officers arrived on \nthe scene in several squad cars, blocking the adjacent intersection. \n202.  During or before their arrests, neither Scott, Wright, nor any other member of \ntheir group was told by the police that any of them was loitering or was instructed to move on. \n203.  Scott was transported to the Northern District precinct.  During his confinement \nthere Scott was verbally abused by police officers on the subject of his religious beliefs.   \n204.  Scott was then transported to the CBIC, where he was subjected to a \nhumiliating and gratuitously invasive strip search by Defendant Corrections Officers Doe K \nand Doe N.  In the presence of another detainee, who was also being strip searched at the \nsame time, Scott was forced to strip to his underwear.  He was made to squat in front of \nOfficers Doe K and Doe N, while they looked inside of Scott's underwear. \n3 7 \n\n205.  After his arrest, Wright was also taken to CBIC.  At CBIC, Wright was also \nsubjected to a humiliating strip search.  In the presence of two jail administrators, Officer \nDoe O forced Wright to remove his shirt and jeans. \n206.  The strip searches of Scott and of Wright were conducted without probable \ncause or individualized suspicion that either Scott or Wright was carrying weapons, drugs, or \ncontraband.  These searches revealed no drugs, weapons or contraband. \n207.  Scott was released at approximately 6:00 a.m. on August 31, 2006 after being \nheld for eight hours.  Wright was held for approximately 20 hours, until he was released on \nhis own recognizance at approximately 6:00 p.m. the next day.   \n208.  Both Scott and Wright were charged with disorderly conduct and loitering.  On \nSeptember 29, 2006 the State’s Attorney nolle prossed all charges against Scott.  On \nOctober 20, 2006, the State’s Attorney nolle prossed all charges against Wright.  \n7  The Illegal Arrest of Carol Higgs \n209.  At approximately 9:00 a.m. on March 2, 2004, primary election day in Maryland, \nCarol Higgs was posting election signs and handing out campaign leaflets.  \n210.  Higgs posted her signs and stood near Chase House, a designated polling \nplace for the primary.   \n211.  She stood outside the area near Chase House, marked by signs posted by \nelection officials, where no electioneering was permitted that day.  An election judge had \nconfirmed to Higgs that she was in compliance with election regulations regarding proximity \nto a polling place. \n3 8 \n\n212.  Officer Pinkosz arrived at Chase House in a squad car.  He approached Ms. \nHiggs and asked her why she was picketing.  She said that she was not picketing but rather \nhanding out campaign literature for her candidate. \n213.  Officer Pinkosz left Higgs and went inside the polling place.  He reemerged and \ntold Ms. Higgs that her campaigning was illegal.   \n214.  When Higgs pointed out that she stood outside the \"no electioneering\" signs \nand was thus in compliance with the law, Officer Pinkosz removed the sign from where it \nwas planted, and without taking any measurements, moved it significantly farther than 100 \nfeet away from the polling place.   \n215.  Higgs then moved, to remain outside the boundary of another sign setting \ncampaigning boundaries.  She also asked Officer Pinkosz for his name and badge number.   \n216.  At this point, Officer Pinkosz demanded her identification.   \n217.  Higgs asked Officer Pinkosz whether she was free to go.  Officer Pinkosz said \nthat she was free to go.  As Higgs gathered her literature, Officer Pinkosz handcuffed her.  He \ntold her that she was being arrested for loitering. \n218.  Higgs was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court \ncommissioner. \n  8.  The Illegal Arrest and Search of Armondo Horsey, and the Illegal Arrest of   \n    Jonathan Lindsay \n \n219.  On July 22, 2007, after a late night out, Armondo Horsey, Jonathan Lindsay, and \nHorsey's brother had ordered a pizza at a pizza shop in the Canton section of Baltimore. \n3 9 \n\n220.  While eating, Horsey, Lindsay, and Horsey's brother noticed Baltimore Police \nDepartment officers detaining a man on a nearby corner.  They observed five officers \nforcefully restraining a man in handcuffs who was lying on the ground. \n221.  Lindsay moved closer to the scene and pulled out his cell phone as if to film \nthe arrest, because he believed the officers were using excessive force.  Two officers at the \nscene observed him with his phone, and told him that he was not allowed to take \nphotographs. \n222.  When Horsey observed Lindsay speaking with the officers, he was concerned \nthat Lindsay was protesting the officers’ use of force, and told him not to get into an \nargument, but just to get the officers’ names and badge numbers.   \n223.  A Baltimore Police Department officer who overheard Horsey’s comment \nsingled him out from among the crowd of onlookers and told him that he was going to jail \nwith the man being restrained.  \n224.  Horsey was then forcefully handcuffed behind his back and pulled backward \ntoward a police van.   \n225.  Horsey was searched at the scene of his arrest.  The search revealed no \ndrugs, contraband or weapons. \n226.  When Lindsay, standing nearby, then called out that Horsey “didn’t even do \nanything,” a Baltimore Police Department officer singled Lindsay out from among the crowd \nof onlookers and placed him in handcuffs.  While in handcuffs an officer searched Lindsay’s \npockets, pulled out his cell phone, and opened it up and scrolled through it to see whether \nthere were any photographs or film of the scene captured on it. \n4 0 \n\n227.  Horsey, Lindsay, and the man who was being restrained on the ground were \nthen placed in a police van and transported to CBIC.  A police officer told Lindsay that he \nshouldn’t worry about being arrested because he would be released in a few hours.  \n228.  At CBIC, Horsey and Lindsay were shuffled among numerous overcrowded jail \ncells with open toilets reeking of excrement. \n229.  At CBIC Officer Doe P strip searched Horsey.  Horsey was made to remove his \npants, and Officer Doe P had Horsey open his waistband and looked into Horsey's \nunderwear.  The strip search was conducted without probable cause or individualized \nsuspicion that Horsey was carrying weapons, drugs, or contraband.  The strip search \nrevealed no drugs, weapons or contraband. \n230.  Horsey and Lindsay were both held at CBIC for about six hours. \n231.  Neither Horsey nor Lindsay was ever prosecuted for any crime or brought \nbefore a court commissioner.  Horsey and Lindsay later learned that Officer Mealey had \ncharged them with failure to obey. \n4 1 \n\n9.  The Illegal Arrest of Erin Marcus \n232.  On October 12, 2007, Erin Marcus, along with seven other members of the \nBaltimore Animal Rights Coalition (BARC), arrived at Salt Restaurant in Baltimore City to \nstage a peaceful protest regarding the restaurant’s use of foie gras.   \n233.  The members arrived outside of the restaurant at approximately 7:30 p.m.  They \nstood clear of the entrance, and did not obstruct the walkway in front of the restaurant.   \n234.  Approximately fifteen to twenty minutes after their arrival two Baltimore Police \nDepartment officers arrived at the scene.  The officers told the BARC members that if they did \nnot cross the street they would be subject to arrest. \n235.  A BARC member then spoke with police officers and explained that he had \ncontacted the Office of Licensing and Permits and was told that the group did not need a \npermit to protest.  Another BARC member attempted to review the Baltimore City loitering \nordinance with the officers, including a shift commander who arrived on the scene, in order \nto establish their legal right to be there. The officers were not persuaded and again told all \nBARC members to cross the street or face arrest. \n236.  All but three BARC members crossed the street and continued protesting on \nthe other side of the street.  Marcus and the other protesters who did not cross the street \nwere arrested. \n237.  Marcus was asked for identification by two female officers.  She showed the \nofficers her driver's license.  One of the female officers frisked Marcus and checked her bag.  \nNo weapons, contraband or drugs were found in this search.   \n4 2 \n\n238.  Marcus was then put in plastic cuffs and placed in the police van with the two \nother BARC members who were arrested.  Marcus was transported to CBIC, arriving about \n45 minutes after her initial encounter with the police.  \n239.  Marcus was then taken to a filthy, crowded cell where some inmates were \nforced to sit on the floor.   \n240.  Marcus was charged with failure to obey, and released on her own \nrecognizance at about 8:00 a.m. on October 13, 2007 after being held at CBIC for about 13 \nhours. \n241.  The State’s Attorney nolle prossed all charges against Marcus on October 16, \n2007. \n10.  The Illegal Search of Jeffrey Chapman \n242.  On or about October 13, 2005, at approximately 6:00 p.m., Jeffrey Chapman \nwas walking on Marion Street in Baltimore eating a snack.  \n243.  Baltimore Police Department Officer Willie N. Kennedy Jr. stopped his bicycle in \nfront of Chapman.  Kennedy arrested Chapman for littering, claiming that Chapman had \ndropped a packet of sweet and sour sauce on the sidewalk.   \n244.  Officer Kennedy walked Chapman to a nearby police substation and placed \nChapman in a makeshift cell, which appeared previously to have been a walk-in freezer.  \nChapman was told that he had been arrested for littering. \n245.  Approximately one hour later, Chapman was transferred to CBIC, arriving at \napproximately 8:00 p.m.   \n4 3 \n\n246.  At CBIC, in the presence of eight to ten other detainees, Chapman was \nsubjected to a humiliating and non-private strip search by Officer Does Q and R.  Chapman \nwas forced to remove all clothing except his underwear.   \n247.  This strip search was conducted despite the lack of probable cause or \nindividualized suspicion that Chapman posed a threat to the security of the facility.  This \nsearch revealed no drugs, weapons or contraband.   \n248.  After this strip search, Chapman was confined to a small filthy cell with more \nthan ten other detainees with an open toilet and a single bench. \n249.  Chapman was released at approximately 6:00 a.m. the next day.   \n250.  Unable to sleep in the crowded cell with no where to lie except the cement floor, \nand fearing for his safety should he fall asleep, Chapman was unable to work the next day.  \n251.  Chapman was never prosecuted for any crime or brought before a court \ncommissioner. \nB.  The Police Department's Illegal Practices \n252.  The experiences of these individual plaintiffs are not unique.  They stem from a \nbroader policy and practice by the Police Department of arresting persons without probable \ncause in order to satisfy performance goals and to show progress in fighting crime by \nmeans of high arrest numbers. \n253.  Under the direction and oversight of the Commissioner and Deputy \nCommissioner, the Police Department has used a \"performance evaluation system\" that \ndemands that officers make a large number of arrests, regardless of the number or success \nof resulting prosecutions.  Each patrol officer is required to tally his enforcement statistics, \n4 4 \n\nincluding citations and arrests.  These numbers are then compared to averages from that \nofficer's squad and shift.  The three officers in each district with the lowest scores are \nsubject to reassignment to other districts. \n254.  Police officers generally disfavor reassignment because it can greatly disrupt \ntheir personal and professional lives. \n255.  Upon information and belief, the Police Department has a policy by which no \nautomatic disciplinary action is taken against a police officer if a plaintiff succeeds in a civil \ncase challenging the conduct of the officer. \n256.  Upon information and belief, the Police Department has no practice of \nreviewing arrests to see whether they result in successful prosecutions, nor of reviewing \narrest reports in those cases that are not prosecuted to determine whether officers had \nsufficient probable cause for the arrest or charge. \n257.  These policies create perverse incentives for police officers by rewarding those \nofficers who arrest innocent bystanders and punishing those who respect their obligations \nto the City and the public.   \n258.  These perverse incentives are unavoidable because, under the \"performance \nevaluation system,\" all arrests are counted—even those made with no basis for probable \ncause.  Furthermore, the Police Department does not punish officers for excessive numbers \nof arrests without probable cause. \n259.  Thus, under this system, an officer will not be reassigned even if every single \none of his arrests is made without probable cause, so long as his volume of arrests is not \n4 5 \n\namong the three lowest in his district.  By contrast, a different officer whose volume of arrests \nis the third lowest in his district will be reassigned even if all of his arrestees were convicted.   \n260.  The system therefore encourages all officers to make as many arrests as \npossible, regardless of their justification, to avoid transfer. \n261.  As confirmation, State's Attorney Patricia Jessamy stated at a public legislative \nhearing on January 4, 2006, that the Police Department routinely and increasingly arrests \npeople without probable cause. \n262.  To exacerbate matters, the Police Department, its Commissioner, Mr. Hamm, \nits Deputy Commissioner, the Mayor, Mr. O'Malley, and the City—though they all are or were, \nat times relevant to this lawsuit, aware of the Police Department's pattern and practice of \nillegal arrests—have failed to take adequate steps to abate the pattern and practice, despite \ntheir authority to do so.  They have failed to train and supervise police officers adequately.  \nThey have not properly encouraged arrests based on probable cause.  They have \naffirmatively encouraged overly aggressive and unlawful police tactics, by directing \nsupervisors to ensure that officers keep arrest numbers up, in the belief that a high number \nof arrests will keep the crime rate down, regardless of the quality of those arrests.  In short, \nthey have made the unconstitutional and illegal conduct worse.  \nC.  Grading the Police Department \n263.  Due to the policies and practices described above, the Baltimore Police \nDepartment has severe police accountability problems. \n264.  Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office Annual Statistical Reports indicate that, \nin 2005, the Police Department arrested 76,497 individuals without warrants.  Prosecutors \n4 6 \n\ndeclined to charge 25,293 of the arrestees.  Thus, during 2005, three out of every ten \npeople arrested without warrants in Baltimore City were not prosecuted, based solely on \na review of the charging documents by the State's Attorney, prior to any involvement by a \ndefense attorney or any decision by a court commissioner or judge.  The State's Attorney has \npublicly stated that prosecutors declined to charge about 30% of the arrestees in 2005 \nbecause, in the State's view, the case was \"legally insufficient.\" \n265.  In 2005, prosecutors indicated that they could not prove charges against 7,510 \npeople arrested for loitering, impeding, or obstructing pedestrian traffic during that year.  \nThose arrests account for nearly 10% of all warrantless arrests in Baltimore for that year.   \n266.  During 2005, prosecutors indicated that they could not prove charges against \n1,832 persons arrested for trespassing and 1,650 persons arrested for disorderly conduct, \nfailure to obey, or disturbing the peace.  Together, these arrests account for nearly another \n5% of all warrantless arrests in Baltimore for that year. \n267.  Thus, prosecutors indicated that they could not prove charges against those \npersons arrested for often vague \"quality of life\" offenses in 2005, which amounted to nearly \n15 percent of the persons arrested without a warrant during that year. \nD.  The Effects of the Police Department's Arrest Policy on CBIC \n268.  The Police Department's pattern and practice of encouraging large numbers of \nillegal arrests causes a backlog at CBIC that leads CBIC to perform unconstitutional strip \nsearches and to subject arrestees to overcrowded conditions and extended detentions.  \n269.  CBIC was designed to handle about 60,000 bookings each year and to \naccommodate 895 arrestees at any one time.  Because of the Police Department's arrest \n4 7 \n\npolicies, it now handles more than 100,000 bookings each year and regularly holds more \nthan 1,200 arrestees at any one time.  Defendant Smith has characterized the problems at \nCBIC as a \"systems overload.\"  The overcrowding at CBIC has led to two distinct problems. \n270.  First, CBIC regularly subjects all male arrestees to public strip searches, \nwithout individualized suspicion and regardless of the arrestees' charges.  Often, these strip \nsearches are humiliating, non-private body cavity searches.  Most of these searches are not \nreasonably related to any legitimate security interest or to any reasonable suspicion of \nconcealed contraband. \n271.  Second, the backlog causes CBIC to delay, in some cases, presentment of \narrestees beyond the twenty-four hour maximum established in Maryland Rule 4-212(f).  In \nsome cases, detainees have been held at CBIC for more than forty-eight hours before \npresentment.  CBIC makes no adequate effort to structure its systems so that it can timely \nprocess all detainees even though CBIC officials are aware of its deficiencies.  Indeed, a \nconsultant's report to the State in October 2005 stated that \"no one [is] in charge\" of ensuring \nthe prompt processing of detainees at CBIC. \n272.  The Warden, Commissioner of Pretrial Services, Secretary, and State condone, \naffirmatively encourage, or knowingly fail to address these two policies and practices at \nCBIC, despite their responsibility to address them through proper training, supervising, \nmonitoring, and disciplining of staff or through the formulating, implementing, and executing \nof appropriate policies. \nE.  The Effects of the Police Department's Arrest Policy on the Arrestees \n273.  These illegal arrests, searches, and detentions traumatize arrestees. \n4 8 \n\n274.  Individuals who are illegally arrested suffer humiliation and degradation when \nthey are being dragged away in handcuffs in front of their friends, family, or neighbors.  The \nstigma of being illegally arrested can follow an arrestee for years, in part because those who \nknow an arrestee are unlikely to forget the sight of the arrestee being hauled away in \nhandcuffs in the back of a police car. \n275.  At CBIC, innocent arrestees are subjected to dehumanizing and humiliating \npublic strip searches that involve stripping down to underwear, pulling down the underwear, \nand—often—submitting to a visual body cavity search.  The searches are performed in \npublic view and alongside other detainees.  The victims of such unwarranted invasions of \nprivacy are humiliated, degraded, and stigmatized. \n276.  An individual who is arrested is often physically harmed or threatened while \ndetained at CBIC.  And the threat does not come just from other arrestees.  In May 2005, a \ndetainee was beaten to death by guards at the CBIC.  In the wake of that incident, eight CBIC \nguards were fired and the FBI has opened an investigation.  The detainee's death was \nclassified as a homicide.   \n277.  While detained at CBIC, an arrestee is held in filthy and overcrowded \nconditions with numerous other arrestees.  Cells are often so crowded that arrestees are \nforced to sleep on the floor.  In some cases, the cells are so crowded that inmates must sit \nor crouch in uncomfortable positions on unsanitary floors for hours at a time.  The \"meals\" \nare inedible. \n278.  An individual who is illegally arrested also suffers the loss of his liberty for \nhours or days.  Such detention can result in a detainee losing his job when he fails to \n4 9 \n\nappear at work and may also harm relations with family if an individual is unable to meet \nfamily obligations while illegally detained. \n279.  The presence of an arrest record, even if the arrestee is \"released without \ncharge,\" can follow an individual for years, making it difficult to obtain jobs, housing, or any \nother opportunity that may require a criminal background check. \n280.  For confirmed criminals, the prospect of spending hours or days in Central \nBooking, while unpleasant, is a cost of doing business, and does nothing to deter them from \ntheir unlawful behavior or to make Baltimore safer.  For innocent victims of these arrest \npractices, however, being unlawfully arrested can be a life-changing event. \nF.  The City's and the Police Department's Response \n281.  Despite these stories and statistics, the City and Police Department make no \napologies. \n282.  In response to repeated and persistent complaints by public officials, Baltimore \ncommunity leaders, and community groups with regard to this ongoing pattern of unlawful \narrests, the City and the Police Department have consistently refused to acknowledge that a \nproblem exists. \n283.  Moreover, former Mayor and Defendant O'Malley consistently refused to \nacknowledge that such a problem exists.     \n284.  At a community forum designed to address police practices on January 4, \n2006, then-Mayor and Defendant O'Malley proposed eliminating oversight by the State's \nAttorney's Office of individuals arrested by the Police Department. \n5 0 \n\n285.  Eliminating the oversight by the State's Attorney's Office would obviously fail to \nhave any effect on the number of illegal arrests.  Such a proposal would succeed at one \nthing, however, it would hide from the public the thousands of illegal arrests made by the \nPolice Department without probable cause. \nVI.  CAUSES OF ACTION \nA.  Count I: Facial and As Applied Challenge to the Loitering Ordinance under the \nFirst, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and \nArticles 19, 26, and 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights \n286.  This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n287.  This Count is brought by the individual Plaintiffs Howard, Braxton, Lowery, \nStoner, Scott, Wright, Higgs, Marcus, Horsey, Lindsay, and Crockett and the NAACP against \nthe City, the Police Department and defendants O’Malley, Dixon, Hamm, Bealefeld, Brown, \nClark, Norris, and Officers Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Heron, Grey, \nChin, Pinkosz, Hamilton, Mealey, and Does 1-100. \n288.  This is an \"as applied\" challenge to the enforcement of the Loitering Ordinance, \nBaltimore, Md., Police Ordinances art. 19, § 25-1 (2005).  In the alternative, it is a facial \nchallenge to the Loitering Ordinance itself. \n289.  The Police Department has interpreted the Loitering Ordinance incorrectly to \nallow arrests of persons engaged in no wrongdoing merely for standing on the public \nsidewalks.  By arresting persons merely for standing, the Police Department has effectuated \na policy of arrests without probable cause that a violation of the Loitering Ordinance has \noccurred in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article 26 of the \nMaryland Declaration of Rights. \n5 1 \n\n290.  In the alternative, if the Police Department correctly interprets the Loitering \nOrdinance to permit an arrest when an innocent bystander merely is standing on a public \nsidewalk, the Loitering Ordinance is unconstitutional on its face as a violation of the First and \nFourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and Articles 19 and 40 of the Maryland \nDeclaration of Rights. \nB.  Count II: Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Violations for Unconstitutional \nArrests under Section 1983 \n291.  This Count incorporates all of the other allegations in this Complaint. \n292.  This Count is brought by the individual Plaintiffs Howard, Braxton, Wilson, \nLowery, Stoner, Johnson, Crockett, Scott, Wright, Higgs, Marcus, Horsey and Lindsay, and \nthe NAACP against the City, the Police Department and defendants O’Malley, Dixon, Hamm, \nBealefeld, Brown, Clark, Norris, and Officers Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold \nJones, Heron, Grey, Chin, Pinkosz, Hamilton, Mealey, and Does 1-100.. \n293.  Defendants the City, the Police Department, O'Malley, Dixon, Hamm, Bealefeld, \nBrown, Clark, Norris, Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Heron, Grey, Chin, \nSouthard, Pinkosz, Hamilton, Mealey, and Officer Does 1-100 are \"persons\" within the \nmeaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n294.  The Defendants violated or caused the violation of the constitutional rights of \nthe individual Plaintiffs. \n295.  Officers Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Heron, Grey, \nChin, Southard, Pinkosz, Hamilton, Mealey, and Officer Does 1-100 directly violated the \n5 2 \n\nconstitutional rights of the individual Plaintiffs by arresting them without probable cause and \nunder an illegal pattern and practice. \n296.  The City, O'Malley, Mayor Dixon, the Police Department, Hamm, Commissioner \nBealefeld, Brown, Clark, and Norris caused these and other similar constitutional violations \nby implementing, following, or failing to remedy the illegal pattern or practice. \n297.  The City, Mayor Dixon, the Police Department, and Commissioner Bealefeld \nwill continue to cause similar constitutional violations by implementing, following, or failing \nto remedy the illegal pattern or practice in the future. \n298.  It is clearly established now and was clearly established at the time of their \nactions that the conduct, patterns, and practices of the Defendants violated and continue to \nviolate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. \n299.  As an actual and proximate result of Defendants' conduct, patterns, and \npractices, individual Plaintiffs suffered damages. \n300.  In addition, because the conduct, patterns, and practices are ongoing, it is likely \nthat Plaintiffs and NAACP members will suffer damages as an actual and proximate result of \nsimilar unconstitutional conduct, patterns, and practices in the future. \nC.

In addition, Defendants Maynard, Smith, and \nFranks are sued in their official capacity for declaratory and prospective injunctive relief.  \nThese defendants are therefore \"persons\" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n303.  The Defendants violated or caused the violation of the constitutional rights of \nthe individual Plaintiffs. \n304.  Officer Does A-R directly violated the constitutional rights of the individual \nPlaintiffs by conducting indiscriminate, non-private, visual strip searches of them, without \nprobable cause or individualized suspicion to believe they possessed weapons or \ncontraband. \n305.  The policy of strip searching, without individualized suspicion, every person \narrested for loitering or other \"quality of life\" offenses is not necessary to protect officer safety, \nto preserve evidence, or to ensure prison security. \n306.  Secretary Maynard, Mary Ann Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, and \nMurphy, with deliberate indifference to the individual Plaintiffs' legal rights, established, \nimplemented, enforced, or failed to remedy an illegal and unconstitutional policy and \npractice at CBIC of conducting indiscriminate, non-private, visual strip searches of persons \ntemporarily detained at the center, without probable cause or individualized suspicion to \nbelieve the detainees possessed weapons or contraband. \n307.  It is clearly established now and was clearly established at the time of their \nactions that the conduct, patterns, and practices of the Defendants violated and continue to \nviolate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. \n5 4 \n\n308.  As an actual and proximate result of Defendants' conduct, patterns, and \npractices, the individual Plaintiffs suffered damages.  \n309.  In addition, because the conduct, patterns, and practices are ongoing, it is likely \nthat the individual Plaintiffs and NAACP members will suffer damages as an actual and \nproximate result of similar unconstitutional conduct, patterns, and practices in the future. \nD.

This Count is brought by Plaintiffs Howard and Braxton against Secretary \nMaynard, Mary Ann Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, and Murphy.

The Defendants violated or caused the violation of the constitutional rights of \nPlaintiffs Howard and Braxton. \n313.  Secretary Maynard, Mary Ann Saar, Commissioner Smith, Warden Franks, and \nMurphy, with deliberate indifference to Howard's and Braxton's legal rights, established, \nimplemented, enforced, condoned, and failed to remedy the conduct, pattern, and practice at \nCBIC of holding detainees for more than twenty-four hours without charges, presentment, or \nrelease. \n314.  It was clearly established at the time of their actions that such conduct, \npatterns, and practices violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution. \n5 5 \n\n315.  As an actual and proximate result of Defendants' conduct, pattern, and practice, \nPlaintiffs Howard and Braxton suffered damages. \nE.

A common-law private cause of action exists to remedy Maryland constitutional \nviolations through both injunctive relief and money damages. \n319.  Officers Jemini Jones, Crites, Pecha, Newkirk, Arnold Jones, Heron, Grey, \nChin, Southard, Pinkosz, Hamilton, Mealey, and Officer Does 1-100 directly violated the \nconstitutional rights of the individual Plaintiffs by arresting them without probable cause and \nunder an illegal pattern and practice. \n320.  The City, the Police Department, and defendants Mayor Dixon, O'Malley, Hamm, \nCommissioner Bealefeld, Brown, Clark, and Norris caused these and other similar \nconstitutional violations by implementing, following, or failing to remedy the illegal pattern or \npractice. \n5 6 \n\n321.

WELLFORD \nAUDITOR \nJUSTICE ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION SERVICES \nApril 30, 2012 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 \n \n\n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n  This is the first report of the Auditor for the settlement between the \nMaryland State Conference of the NAACP Branches, et.al. and the Baltimore \nPolice Department (BPD), et.al. (hereinafter the Voluntary Agreement).  The \nAuditor was selected by the parties to the agreement and notified of his selection in \nOctober of 2010.  The Auditor submitted a required work plan and detailed \nauditors manual that were approved by March of 2011.  The contract for the \nservices of the auditor was issued at the end of July 2011.  The Auditor submitted \nto the parties for their approval staff who would work on the audit.  The Auditor \nwas notified on staff approval in March of 2011.   \n  This report, using the methods approved in the Audit Manual, assesses the \nextent of compliance with each of the auditable tasks contained in the voluntary \nagreement.  The audit has determined that the Baltimore Police Department is in \ncompliance with 16 of the tasks (46%), in material compliance with 17 of the tasks \n(48%), and in noncompliance with one (3%) of the tasks.  The compliance status of \n1 (3%) of the tasks has not been determined.    While the Department is making \nprogress in complying with tasks that address policies and procedures, to date the \nBaltimore Police Department has not achieved compliance with the task that \nmeasures behavioral changes in arrests for Quality of Life Offenses1. \n                                                 \n1 The Voluntary Agreement requires inclusion of comments by the BPD on this report as an appendix to the report,  \nThese comments are contained in Appendix A.   \n2 \n \n\n \nTASK AUDIT \nTask 1.  Within thirty days of the effective date of this Agreement, the Department \nshall issue a policy stating that the Department does not support a policy of Zero \nTolerance Policing.  Quality of Life Offenses2 committed in an officer’s presence \nmay be enforced by several means, including but not limited to:  Counseling, \nverbal warning, written citation or arrest.   \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE   \nThe Department issued a Police Commissioners Memorandum on July 29, \n2010 (PC Memorandum 11-10) that contains all of the elements required by this \ntask. \nTask 2. Within 30 days of the Effective Date of this Agreement, the Department \nshall issue a written directive or directives enumerating the elements of each \nQuality of Life Offense and providing guidance on appropriately identifying and \nreacting to conduct that does and does not amount to a Quality of Life Offense, \nincluding guidance on conduct that is protected by the First Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution.   \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE   \n                                                 \n2 In the Voluntary Agreement, Quality of Life Offenses are defined as including the following offenses: “loitering, \ntrespassing, public defecation/urination, open container, disorderly conduct (particularly “failure to obey” and \ndisturbing the peace), hindering, and littering”. \n3 \n \n\n \nThe Department issued a Police Commissioners Memorandum on July 29, \n2010 (PC Memorandum 13-10) that contains all of the elements required by this \ntask. \nTask 3.  The written directive or directives concerning Quality of Life Offenses \nrequired by Section IV.B.1.a.2 of the Voluntary Agreement shall include a \nrequirement that any time an officer effects a custodial arrest for a Quality of Life \nOffense, the officer shall record in the incident report and the statement of \nprobable cause the factual basis for his or her decision to effect a custodial arrest, \nrather than providing counseling, a verbal warning or issuing a citation.  \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE   \nThe Department issued a Police Commissioners Memorandum on July 29, \n2010 (PC Memorandum 14-10) that exceeds the requirements of this task. \na.    The Auditor shall review a statistically meaningful sample of statements \nof probable cause required by section IV.B.1.a.2.a to determine whether the \nfactual narrative of the arrest could on its face support a finding of probable cause \nand that the arrest was in accord with the Policies. \nSTATUS: NONCOMPLIANCE  \nTo assess compliance with this task the Auditor selected a 25% sample of all \nQuality of Life Offense arrests for the months of April 2011 through December of \n2011.  The Department provided copies of the statements of probable cause for \n4 \n \n\n \nthese sampled arrests.  The attorney assisting the auditor read each of the sampled \narrests to determine if they contained acceptable statements of probable cause and \nif the arrest was in accord with the department’s policies noted in Tasks 1-3 above.  \nDuring this period the Department provided files on 72,546 arrests of which \n4,433 (6.1% of all arrests) were for Quality of Life Offenses as defined by the \nVoluntary Agreement3.  The random sample of these quality of life offenses \ntotaled 1,113.  Compliance with this task was determined by the analysis of these \nsampled cases.  The Audit Manual stated that to be in full compliance the analysis \nof the sampled cases would have to result in a level of estimated compliance that \nincluded the possibility that 100% of the cases were compliant.   \nIn reviewing the sampled cases to determine compliance, we encountered \ntwo unexpected issues.  First, each month a number of the sampled cases of \nQuality of Life arrests involved arrests for offenses that emerged after the stop for \nthe Quality of Life Offense.  For example, an officer approaches a person who is \non private property and as the officer approaches, the person of interest drops \nsomething that later turns out to be a controlled substance.  The officer arrests the \nperson for trespassing and for possession of the controlled substance without \nindicating in the report that an alternative to arrest was considered.  In these \n                                                 \n3 We also requested and were provided arrest data for April of 2010 and September of 2010.  We compared these \nmonths to the comparable months in 2011.  This analysis showed a decline in arrests and Quality of Life arrests of \nbetween 16 and 25%.  Arrests and quality of life arrests have decreased since the issuance of the policies noted in \nTasks 1-3. \n5 \n \n\n \ninstances we determined, after consultation with the parties to the Voluntary \nAgreement, that as long as the arrest report accurately stated probable cause these \narrests would be considered consistent with departmental policy and were \ncompliant for purposes of this audit.  In other words, those arrests were counted as \ncompliant even though the probable cause statement did not indicate that an \nalternative was considered. \nThe second issue we encountered was that the Department reported that 231 \nof the cases we sampled in this nine month period were unavailable because the \nrecords had been expunged.  It was explained that pursuant to the statute the \nDepartment was required to expunge the records of those who were arrested but \nwere released without charges (referred to as RWOC cases).  We sought these \nrecords because it is likely that these cases are non-compliant because they \nrepresent the kind of cases that prompted the law suit that resulted in the \nVoluntary Agreement we are auditing.  When our draft report was reviewed by the \nrepresentatives of the plaintiffs, they pointed out that while the statute (Md.Code, \nCrim. Proc. §10-101) requires expungement in these cases, it further requires that \nthe Department retain the record for three years.  The Department, in response to \nour inquiry concerning this, stated that after expungement the records were not \navailable through the Department’s management information system.  During the \nnext reporting period we will continue to seek access to these cases. In fact, the \n6 \n \n\n \nDepartment is not compliant with this task no matter how we handle the expunged \ncases.  We expect that for future reports, when these cases may be more important \nfor determining compliance, they will be made available to us. We may not be \nable to confidently determine the Department is in compliance with this task \nwithout access to the expunged cases.  For the current report, this is not a \nsignificant issue because the Department is not in compliance whether or not the \nexpunged cases are included.  If however, a future report would find compliance \nwas achieved but the expunged cases were not reviewed, it would be difficult to \naccurately determine compliance with confidence.  This is why for future reports \nevery effort will be made to access the probable cause statements for the expunged \ncases. \nThe review of the sampled cases (not including the expunged cases) \ndetermined that the Department complied with this task in 83% of the arrests with \na margin of error of +/-3%4.  The primary reason for non-compliance was the \nabsence of an explanation of why a non-custodial disposition was not appropriate \nin the case.  Therefore, it was determined that the Department was not in \ncompliance (the Auditor’s Manual makes clear that for this task material \ncompliance and compliance are treated without distinction). \n                                                 \n4 As noted above, each month a substantial portion of the quality of life arrests included arrests for other offenses.  \nAfter consultation with the parties to the agreement, the Auditor decided that as long as probable cause was \nestablished these arrests were judged to be compliant. If these arrests were eliminated from the analysis, the \ncompliance rate would be 65% (+/-4%).  If the expunged cases were counted as non-compliant and included in the \ndenominator, the compliance rate would be estimated at 65% (+/-3%). \n7 \n \n\n \nTask 4.  Within 30 days of the effective date of this Agreement, the \nDepartment shall issue a written directive requiring officers to provide their names \nand badge numbers to any individual who requests this information.  \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE  \nThe Department issued Police Commissioners Memorandum (14-10) on July \n29, 2010 that met all of the requirements of this task. \nTask 5.  The Zero Tolerance Policing policy required by section IV.B.1.a.1 shall \nnot be rescinded or diminished by the Department during the term of this \nAgreement.  \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE  \nThe Auditor has verified that this policy has not been rescinded. \nTask 6.  The written directive or directives required by section IV.B.1.a.2 of the \nVoluntary Agreement shall not be rescinded or diminished by the Department \nduring the term of this Agreement unless (a) the Department determines, in good \nfaith and upon advice of counsel, that the policies conflict or will conflict with any \napplicable law, regulation, or court order; or (b) the Department determines in \ngood faith that such rescission or diminishment is necessary for the safety of the \npublic or Department personnel.  In the event the Department concludes a \nmodification of the written directive or directives required by section IV.B.1.a.2 is \nnecessary, it will notify Plaintiffs’ Counsel of the planned modification and offer a \n8 \n \n\n \nreasonable opportunity for Plaintiffs’ Counsel to comment upon it.  The \nDepartment shall in good faith consider such comments.  \nTHERE IS NO AUDIT FUNCTION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TASK AND IT \nWILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN AUDIT REPORTS.  HOWEVER, IF CHANGES \nARE MADE USING THE PROCESS SPECIFIED THE AUDITOR WILL \nINCLUDE THOSE CHANGES IN THE AUDIT MANUAL AFTER BEING \nINFORMED OF THE CHANGES BY THE DEPARTMENT. \nSTATUS: NO CHANGES NOTED \n \nTask 7.  The Municipal Defendants shall provide the Auditor with access to all \nofficers, employees, documents, and data of the Municipal Defendants that are \nreasonably necessary to complete the Tasks enumerated in this Agreement.  \nTHERE IS NO AUDIT FUNCTION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TASK AND IT \nWILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN AUDIT REPORTS.  ALL INSTANCES OF \nFAILURE TO PROVIDE ACCESS WILL BE NOTED IN RELEVANT \nSECTIONS OF THE REQUIRED BI-ANNUAL AUDIT REPORTS ALONG \nWITH AN ASSESSMENT OF HOW SUCH DENIAL MAY HAVE IMPACTED \nTHE AUDIT. \n \n9 \n \n\n \nTask 8.  Within 120 days of the Effective Date of this Agreement, the Department \nshall develop a document and database retention protocol to maintain and retain all \nrecords, including documents and the database described in Section IV.B.1.c of \nthe Voluntary Agreement, documenting compliance with the terms of this \nAgreement and all documents required by or developed pursuant to this \nAgreement.  The protocol shall be evaluated and reported on by the Auditor.   \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE5 \n  Completion of this task and a number of tasks that follow are related to the \ndevelopment of new software and related operational procedures.  The BPD has \nselected a vendor for the development of this software (IAPro is one of the \nstandard internal affairs software packages used by police departments) and has \nentered into a contract for the adaption of this software to the needs of the BPD.  \nIAPro will address issues of record retention, supervisory review of quality of life \narrests, and the tracking and monitoring of citizen complaints.  IAPro has the \ncapabilities to provide for the all of the tasks related to these activities.  Originally, \nthe vendor was to test IAPro in January of 2012 with implementation shortly after \nthe test.  The test was postponed by the vendor and now is scheduled to take place \n                                                 \n5 Attorneys for the plaintiffs disagree with the assessment of this task and tasks 10, 13, 14, 18-22 and 29 as being in \nmaterial compliance because the IAPro database is significantly late in being developed, and the Auditor could have \nreviewed files without access to the database.  While these are reasonable positions, the Auditor has concluded that \nthe database is essential for the completion of the tasks and while it should have been developed sooner, the BPD is \nmaking an effort to make it operational.  If during the next audit period this has not been remedied and access to \nneeded data is not provided to the Auditor, the assessment of compliance is highly likely to change. Furthermore, it \nshould be noted that because this task was not completed in the specified time period, it can never be judged to be \nmore than materially compliant. \n10 \n \n\n \nat the end of March.  The delay is explained by the BPD as being a result of other \ncommitments that prevent the vendor from meeting the agreed upon schedule.  \nSince the BPD has taken the steps to implement substantial information \ntechnology changes that are very likely to achieve compliance with this task, they \nhave been judged to be in material compliance with this task. \nTask 9.  Within 180 days of the effective date of this Agreement, the Municipal \nDefendants shall create and automate a database to track police officer \nperformance.   \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  Completion of this task and a number of tasks that follow are related to the \ndevelopment of new software and related operational procedures.  The BPD has \nselected a vendor for the development of this software (IAPro is one of the \nstandard internal affairs software packages used by police departments) and has \nentered into a contract for the adaption of this software to the needs of the BPD.  \nIAPro will address issues of record retention, supervisory review of quality of life \narrests, and the tracking and monitoring of citizen complaints.  IAPro has the \ncapabilities to provide for the all of the tasks related to these activities.  Originally, \nthe vendor was to test IAPro in January of 2012 with implementation shortly after \nthe test.  The test was postponed by the vendor and now is scheduled to take place \nat the end of March.  The delay is explained by the BPD as being a result of other \n11 \n \n\n \ncommitments that prevent the vendor from meeting the agreed upon schedule.  \nSince the BPD has taken the steps to implement substantial information \ntechnology changes that are very likely to achieve compliance with this task, they \nhave been judged to be in material compliance with this task. \n \n \nTask 10. Within 180 days of the effective date of this Agreement, the Department \nshall: \n  a.  establish and enforce a policy and procedure requiring shift supervisors to \nreview statements of probable cause for custodial arrests for Quality of Life \nOffenses to ensure that probable cause in fact existed and that the arrest was in \naccord with the Policies.  If, after this agreement has been in effect for 365 days, \nthe result of the review is a determination that the arrest was in contravention of \nthe Policies, the supervisor shall refer the matter to his or her command for action \nconsistent with the policy established.  If the result of the review is a \ndetermination that the arrest is consistent with the Policies, the supervisor shall \ndetermine the necessity, if any, for non-punitive counseling.  \n  b.  establish and enforce a policy and procedure requiring a line supervisor’s \nreview of probable cause statements for custodial arrests for Quality of Life \nOffenses is reviewed by second-level supervisors on a periodic basis, not to \n12 \n \n\n \nexceed every six months, to ensure that probable cause in fact existed and that the \narrest was in accord with the Policies; \n  c.  establish a policy identifying corrective actions, up to and including \ndisciplinary action, as warranted and consistent with established Departmental \ndisciplinary policies, procedures, contracts, memoranda of understanding, and all \napplicable laws governing the discipline of law enforcement officers, including, \nbut not limited to the Law Enforcement Officer’s Bill of Rights. (“LEOBR”), Md. \nAnn. Code, Public Safety Act, 3-101, et seq., to be taken by the Department when \nan officer’s conduct is deemed to be in contravention of the Policies; \nSTATUS : MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  The BPD has established policy to require supervisors to review probable \ncause statements in all quality of life arrests.  Furthermore, the BPD now requires \nperiodic review by second-level supervisors.  Hence there is already compliance \nwith sections a and b of this task.  To date the policy on corrective actions has not \nbeen implemented and will not be until such time as the information system to \ntrack complaints (see above discussion of IAPro) is operational. Hence, the \nconclusion of material compliance which is, in this instance, partial compliance \nwith action to complete task 10 c. underway.  When we are able to access the \nreviews by supervisors of quality of life offenses it will be important that we \nunderstand how expunged cases are reviewed and, if they are reviewed, how we \n13 \n \n\n \ncan retrieve the probable cause statements for inclusion in the analysis conducted \nto assess compliance with Task 3 a. If they are not reviewed that would strongly \nsuggest non –compliance with this and related tasks. \nTask 11.  Within 365 days of the effective date of this Agreement, the Department \nshall develop protocols for use of the database in evaluating compliance with the \nPolicies.  Such protocols shall establish reasonable triggering thresholds for \nreview of officer conduct to monitor effective compliance with the Policies.  The \nprotocols referred to here are the “triggering points” for the EWS.  The Auditor \nwill confirm that each of the protocols required by the Agreement is developed \nand implemented.  The Auditor will also report on the efficacy of the triggering \npoints established by the Department. \nSTATUS:   MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  Completion of this task requires the development of new software and \nrelated operational procedures.  The BPD has selected a vendor for the \ndevelopment of this software (IAPro is one of the standard internal affairs software \npackages used by police departments) and has entered into a contract for the \nadaption of this software to the needs of the BPD.  IAPro will address issues of \nrecord retention, supervisory review of quality of life arrests, and the tracking and \nmonitoring of citizen complaints.  IAPro has the capabilities to provide for the all \nof the tasks related to these activities.  Originally, the vendor was to test IAPro in \n14 \n \n\n \nJanuary of 2012 with implementation shortly after the test.  The test was postponed \nby the vendor and now is scheduled to take place at the end of March.  The delay is \nexplained by the BPD as being a result of other commitments that prevent the \nvendor from meeting the agreed upon schedule.  Since the BPD has taken the steps \nto implement substantial information technology changes that are very likely to \nachieve compliance with this task, they have been judged to be in material \ncompliance with this task.  This system will be used to develop the early warning \nsystem and trigger points called for in this task. \n \nTask 12.  Within 90 days of the effective date of this Agreement, the Municipal \nDefendants shall enter all citizen complaints into a database.  The database shall \ninclude the file number of the complaint (also provided to the complainant); the \nnames of all accused officers, if provided or known; contact information for all \ncomplainants, non-accused but related officers, and witnesses, if provided or \nknown; the race and gender of all involved officers and complainants if known or \nascertainable by reasonable investigation; a narrative description of the \nallegations; significant dates; the street address and district of the incident; and the \ndisposition of the complaint (sustained, not sustained, unfounded or exonerated).  \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n15 \n \n\n \n  Completion of this task requires development of new software and related \noperational procedures.  The BPD has selected a vendor for the development of \nthis software (IAPro is one of the standard internal affairs software packages used \nby police departments) and has entered into a contract for the adaption of this \nsoftware to the needs of the BPD.  IAPro will address issues of record retention, \nsupervisory review of quality of life arrests, and the tracking and monitoring of \ncitizen complaints.  IAPro has the capabilities to provide for the all of the tasks \nrelated to these activities.  Originally, the vendor was to test IAPro in January of \n2012 with implementation shortly after the test.  The test was postponed by the \nvendor and now is scheduled to take place at the end of March.  The delay is \nexplained by the BPD as being a result of other commitments that prevent the \nvendor from meeting the agreed upon schedule.  Since the BPD has taken the steps \nto implement substantial information technology changes that are very likely to \nachieve compliance with this task, they have been judged to be in material \ncompliance with this task. \n \nTask 13.  Complainants shall be allowed to initiate complaints against an officer \nin person, by telephone, by mail, by fax, or via the internet.  A complainant shall \nnot be required to fill out or sign a form to initiate a complaint.  Municipal \n16 \n \n\n \nDefendants may seek from the complainant sufficient information to enable the \nidentification of the involved officers and incident.  \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE \n  General Order C-07 issued on April 8, 2004 details the process for receiving \nand processing civilian complaints.  In part it states that a citizen cannot be turned \naway or instructed to go to another office or person to lodge a complaint against a \npolice officer.  However, the citizen is given the address and location of other \noffices where a complaint can be filed.  As specified in that document, in a \nbrochure that has been developed by the BPD to explain the complaint process, \nand on the BPD website (in the FAQ section) which was last modified in August \nof 2011)) complaints can be made in person, by phone, by mail or by e-mail.  \nWhile they do not provide for fax submission, these procedures are fully \ncompliant with the intent of the task which was to provide multiple ways for the \npublic to file a complaint. \nTask 14.  Complainants shall be permitted to initiate complaints anonymously, in \nwriting or verbally.  Third-part complaints shall be allowed.  \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE \n   In General Order C-07 and the above referenced brochure and website, \ncitizens are informed that they can file complaints in writing or verbally.  If a \ncomplaint involves allegations of excessive force, discourtesy, or harassment, the \n17 \n \n\n \nBPD requires that the complainants put the complaint in writing and swear to its \naccuracy, but members of the Internal Affairs Division can notarize these \ncomplaints.  While The BPD policy and procedures as described on the website do \nnot specifically include or exclude third party complaints, the Department \nindicates they are accepted.   \n  For Tasks 13, 14, 18 – 21, the Settling Parties anticipate that the Auditor \nwill evaluate the Department’s compliance with this task by reviewing a \nstatistically meaningful sample of complaint investigation files and other \ndocumentation, if any, identified by the Auditor.  Such sample shall include \na meaningful percentage of investigation files regarding complaints for false \narrest or lack of probable cause for Quality of Life Offenses to satisfy \nsection IV.B.1.b.18 of this Agreement. \nSTATUS: Not yet determined \nThe BPD has informed the Auditor that until the information system being \ndeveloped to track complaints (IAPro) is developed, it is not able to provide access \nto the information required to select a sample of files for investigation.  This task \nwill be evaluated in the next semi-annual report. \nTask 15.  Within 180 days of the Effective Date of this Agreement, a telephone \nnumber shall be created to allow for toll free calls to initiate complaints.  \n18 \n \n\n \n  The auditor will verify that such a number is created and will on a monthly \nbasis verify that it is operational by calling it with a test report. \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE \n  A toll-free number is provided on the BPD website and is operational.  \nTesting each month demonstrated that the line is operational and being answered. \nTask 16.  Within 180 days of the Effective Date of this Agreement, the telephone \nnumber shall be advertised with the goal that Baltimore residents and visitors \nshould be generally aware of how to initiate a complaint.  \n  The Auditor will verify that the number is advertised by reviewing the \nadvertisement strategies that the Department uses and verifying that the strategies \nare in fact implemented.  There will be no effort to determine the extent to which \nthe advertising effort reaches the intended audiences. \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE \n  The number has been included on the website and is contained in a brochure \nthat is available in each district station, at police headquarters, and at other City \noffices.  Printed posters are displayed in each District and in the Office of the \nCivilian Review Board, the Legal Affairs Bureau, and the Internal Affairs Office.  \nThe website and the brochure give clear instructions on how to make a complaint.  \nThe Audit does not include an assessment of the success of these strategies. \n19 \n \n\n \nTask 17.  Within 365 days of the Effective Date of this Agreement, the Municipal \nDefendants shall publicize information concerning the purpose and goals of the \ncitizen complaint and resolution process, and the process for initiating a complaint, \nincluding publishing and distributing pamphlets describing the complaint and \nresolution process and holding at least one community meeting in each police \ndistrict.  \n  The Auditor will verify that the required information is publicized as \nspecified by reviewing the required pamphlet, how the pamphlet is distributed, and \nthe minutes of all community meetings where the information is discussed and/or \npresented.  Compliance will require development of the pamphlet, its distribution, \nand documentation of at least one community meeting in each police district where \nthe citizen complaint and resolution process is described.   \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  The Auditor has reviewed the above mentioned brochure and determined \nthat it contains the elements required by this task.  The BPD has not yet provided \nto the Auditor the documentation of the presentation of the complaint and \nresolution process in a community meeting in each district. While the brochure was \nproduced and distributed within 365 days of the effective date of the agreement, at \nthe time of this report it is not known when or if the community meetings occurred. \n20 \n \n\n \nTask 18.  Investigators shall attempt to interview complainants and witnesses at \ntheir own convenience, but, if necessary, shall offer to conduct interviews during \nnon-business hours or at locations other than Departmental offices.  \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  General Order C-07 requires and the brochure states that the investigator of \ncivilian complaints is to make every effort to “reasonably accommodate you during \nthe complaint process”.  Once the Auditor has access to the complaint files and the \nInternal Investigations Division staff, the extent to which this policy is adhered to \nwill be determined.   \nTask 19.  If conduct in contravention of Departmental policy, other than the \nconduct alleged by the complainant, is discovered in the course of an investigation, \nthe Department shall investigate such other conduct.  \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  General Order C-08 issued August 26, 2011 specifies the Internal \nInvestigation Division (IID) has responsibility for all investigations of all \nallegations of misconduct by employees of the Department.  This policy does not \nlimit the IID’s ability to initiate investigations of instances of conduct in \ncontravention of Departmental policy that is discovered during the course of an \ninvestigation.  The BPD reports it is the practice of the IID to investigate all \nviolations of departmental policy regardless of the manner in which they become \n21 \n \n\n \naware of the violation.  However, until the information system being developed to \ntrack complaints (IAPro) is developed the Auditor will not be able to select a \nsample of cases to study to determine the extent to which this occurs.  This will be \nevaluated in the next semi-annual report. \nTask 20.  Upon request, the Department shall provide a complainant reasonable \nupdates on the status of the investigation.  Even absent any such request for \ninformation, complainants shall be apprised of the status of open complaints every \n60 days and promptly upon resolution of the investigation.  \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  The policy on investigations and the above referenced brochure provided to \nthe public make clear that the complainants may contact their assigned investigator \nto get answers to questions about their complaint or to express concerns.  However, \nuntil the information system being developed to track complaints (IAPro) is \ndeveloped, the Auditor will not be able to select a sample of cases to study to \ndetermine the extent to which this occurs.  This will be evaluated in the next semi-\nannual report. \nTask 21.  All findings shall be based on the “preponderance of the evidence” \nstandard, and all investigators shall be trained on that standard.  Investigators shall \nbe required to state the factual basis for each finding in the final repost of each \ninvestigation.  \n22 \n \n\n \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  All investigations are conducted to meet the preponderance of evidence test.  \nThis is the burden of proof required by Maryland statute (Md. State Code Ann.§ \n10-217).  Investigators are instructed to use this standard.  However, until the \ninformation system being developed to track complaints (IAPro) is developed the \nAuditor will not be able to select a sample of cases to study to determine the extent \nto which this occurs.  This will be evaluated in the next semi-annual report. \nTask 22.  The Municipal Defendants shall make final determinations of all citizen \ncomplaints, and shall inform each complainant in writing of the final determination \non his or her complaint.  \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  The BPD reports that it is the practice of the department to inform each \ncomplainant in writing upon the completion of the investigation of their complaint.  \nA revision of the policy on the conduct of IID investigations is being developed.  \nThe BPD reports that the revisions will include a specific requirement that \ncomplainants will be informed in writing when the investigation is completed.  The \nAuditor will review the revised policy when it is available.  BPD has informed the \nAuditor that until the information system being developed to track complaints \n(IAPro) is developed it is not able to provide access to the information required to \n23 \n \n\n \nselect a sample of files for investigation.  This task will be evaluated in the next \nsemi-annual report. \nTask 23.  When a review of an officer’s performance is triggered by a data \nanalysis under Section IV.B.1.c.3 of the Voluntary Agreement, the Department \nshall notify the appropriate supervisor of the officer or officers in question.  This \nnotice shall include the information available from the database (Task 9 above) \nthat triggered the review.  \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  Completion of this task requires the development of new software and \nrelated operational procedures.  The BPD has selected a vendor for the \ndevelopment of this software (IAPro is one of the standard internal affairs software \npackages used by police departments) and has entered into a contract for the \nadaption of this software to the needs of the BPD.  IAPro will address issues of \nrecord retention, supervisory review of quality of life arrests, and the tracking and \nmonitoring of citizen complaints.  IAPro has the capabilities to provide for the all \nof the tasks related to these activities.  Originally, the vendor was to test IAPro in \nJanuary of 2012 with implementation shortly after the test.  The test was postponed \nby the vendor and now is scheduled to take place at the end of March.  The delay is \nexplained by the BPD as being a result of other commitments that prevent the \nvendor from meeting the agreed upon schedule.  Since the BPD has taken the steps \n24 \n \n\n \nto implement substantial information technology changes that are very likely to \nachieve compliance with this task, they have been judged to be in material \ncompliance with this task.  This task will be evaluated in the next semi-annual \nreport. \nTask 24.  Once notified, a supervisor shall conduct a reasonable investigation of \nthe performance of the officer in question by reviewing records relative to the \nconduct that triggered the review (e.g., complaint records, statements of probable \ncause, incident reports, etc.).  The review shall specifically include a determination \nof the sufficiency of the probable cause underlying each Quality of Life arrest that \nis associated with the conduct under review.  Based upon the review of related \nrecords, the supervisor shall determine, based upon a preponderance of the \ndocumentary evidence, whether the officer’s actions are in contravention of the \nPolicies.  If the result of the review is a determination that the officer’s actions are \nin contravention of the Policies, the supervisor shall refer the matter to his or her \ncommand for action consistent with the policy established under section IV.B.c.2.c \nof the Voluntary Agreement.  If the result of the review is a determination that the \nofficer’s actions are consistent with the Policies, the supervisor shall determine the \nnecessity, if any for non-punitive counseling.  \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n25 \n \n\n \n  The BPD reports and General Order C-08 requires that these procedures are \nfollowed.  However, completion of this task requires the development of new \nsoftware and related operational procedures.

Upon completion of the review, the investigating supervisor shall \nprovide written documentation of the process and the results of the investigation in \nthe form of a review memorandum.  The review memorandum shall specifically \n26 \n \n\n \ndocument the conduct of the investigation, the outcome of the review and whether \nthe supervisor provided the officer with non-punitive counseling.  \nSTATUS: MATERIAL COMPLIANCE \n  The BPD reports and General Order C-08 requires that these procedures are \nfollowed.

The Municipal Defendants shall monitor citizen complaints related to \nQuality of Life Offenses to gauge the effectiveness of training and to detect the \nneed for new or further training.  \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE \n  It is reported that the BPD Director of Training has revised training \ncurricula in response to information on problems in the probable cause statements \nin some Quality of Life arrests.  In addition, the Director has instituted on-going \ntraining to improve report writing generally.  Once the IAPro system is developed \nand used to identify problems, this task will be addressed with more systematic \ndata on issues that training can address. \nTask 29.  Except with respect to complaints subject to the statutory requirements \nof Article 4, section 16-44 of the Public Local Laws of Maryland, the Municipal \nDefendants shall monitor and be responsible for completing all investigations and \nshall not have discretion to reject a citizen complaint without investigation if \n30 \n \n\n \nsufficient information is provided to or obtained by the Municipal Defendants \nthrough reasonable investigation.  \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE \n  Departmental policy (General Order C-07), the essence of which is included \non the BPD website describing the complaint process, requires that all complaints \nbe investigated.  Once the Auditor has access to the sample of complaints and \ninvestigations, we will determine the extent to which these policies and statements \nare followed.   \nTask 30.  Within 120 days of the effective date of this Agreement, the Municipal \nDefendants shall create and maintain individual training records for all police \nofficers, documenting the date and topic of all pre-service and in-service training \ncompleted.  These records shall also reflect whether the training was completed \nsatisfactorily, as well as the reasons for any mandatory re-training.  \nSTATUS: COMPLIANCE  \n  The Auditor inspected the training records maintained by the training \nacademy and verified that individual records were being maintained and that they \ncontained all elements specified in the task.`  \nTask 31.
