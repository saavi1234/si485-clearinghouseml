As revealed by its Inspect General, NSA is known to have a program to collect metadata from telephone, text message and email records from certain telephony carriers including Verizon. CEI requested the copies of all text message data, and particularly all metadata of text messaging activity using Verizon voice and/or data accounts in NSA’s possession. </p><p>On September 5, 2014, defendant filed for summary judgment. </p><p>In response, the plaintiffs argued that NSA has waived its right to issue such a response by its previous official acknowledgment that it has the records they seek. The judge found that despite their FOIA requests for email and text records, the plaintiffs failed to identify any evidence showing that the NSA actually collects this information on a widespread basis. </p><p>On January 13, 2015, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant. The court stated that plaintiffs failed to point to concrete evidence showing that the NSA has actually admitted this fact.</p><p>The court entered a judgment for the defendant on the same day. The case is closed. </p>",

EPA is required to preserve most or all of this information by the Federal \n1 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00975-JEB   Document 1   Filed 06/09/14   Page 2 of 20\n \nRecords Act (FRA), 44 U.S.C. 3101 et seq. Instead EPA failed to obtain, ignored, or \nacquiesced in, the destruction of these federal records. \n3.  The information plaintiff CEI sought is “metadata” (which includes duration and time of \nthe communication, sender and recipient, etc.) from communications made by phone, \nemail and text message by EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. Plaintiffs E&E Legal and \nFME Law sought information from a Verizon account used by McCarthy’s predecessor, \nformer EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson. This account became subject to FOIA and FRA \ndue to her use of it to correspond with lobbying interests (e.g., Sierra Club and Siemens). \n4.  Fortunately, in the course of its data collection programs, NSA captured and preserved \nthese federal records. Although NSA refuses to process the requests at issue in this matter \non the basis that confirming or denying the existence of this information and the relevant \ncollection program would pose a threat to national security, it has already acknowledged \nthe program’s existence, which is of great public interest.  Similarly, in the past two years \nEPA’s electronic correspondence and recordkeeping (“transparency”) practices have \nbecome the subject of great controversy and public, congressional and media interest. \n5.  EPA officials’ decisions to use non-official accounts for official or work-related \ncorrespondence made this information and these accounts subject to FOIA and FRA. \nWhether EPA (or NSA) failed to maintain or preserve such information does not change \nwhether it constituted agency records under FOIA, or federal records subject to the FRA.  \n6.  Similarly, when NSA obtained records, particularly of federal agency activity such as \ninformation EPA was not preserving, they became “agency records” under FOIA, which \nhas the broadest definition of “records” of any applicable statute, and became federal \nrecords subject to the FRA. \n2 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00975-JEB   Document 1   Filed 06/09/14   Page 3 of 20\n \n7.  “FOIA directs that ‘each agency, upon any request for records . . ., shall make the records \npromptly available to any person’ for ‘public inspection and copying,’ unless the records \nfall within one of the exclusive statutory exemptions.” Judicial Watch v. Dep’t of Justice, \n365 F.3d 1108, 1112 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(2), (a)(3)(A)). “The \nbasic purpose of FOIA is to ensure an informed citizenry, vital to the functioning of a \ndemocratic society, needed to check against corruption and to hold the governors \naccountable to the governed.” N.L.R.B. v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214, 242 \n(1978); see also N.L.R.B. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 153 (1975) (concluding \nthat FOIA “represents a strong congressional aversion to secret (agency) law, and \nrepresents an affirmative congressional purpose to require disclosure of documents which \nhave the force and effect of law.”). FOIA is broadly conceived to permit access to \n“official information” as part of a “general philosophy of full agency disclosure,” EPA v. \nMink, 410 U.S. 73, 80 & n. 6 (1973), such that “the Government’s activities be opened to \nthe sharp eye of public scrutiny.” U.S. Dep’t of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom \nof Press, 489 U.S. 749, 774 & n.20 (1989). “FOIA thus mandates that an agency disclose \nrecords on request, unless they fall within one of nine exemptions. These exemptions are \n‘explicitly made exclusive,’ and must be ‘narrowly construed,’” Milner v. Dep’t of Navy, \n131 S. Ct. 1259, 1262 (2011), and it is the government’s burden to prove that a given \nexemption applies. Campbell v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 164 F.3d 20, 30 (D.C. Cir. 1998). \n8.  The NSA’s program of collecting phone and text message metadata is widely known, and \nhas been acknowledged by the President, by the Inspector General of the NSA, and by \nVerizon, one of the companies which provided metadata to the NSA. \n3 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00975-JEB   Document 1   Filed 06/09/14   Page 4 of 20\n \n9.  Despite these numerous acknowledgements, the NSA has neither provided the federal \nrecords sought by plaintiffs’ FOIA requests nor denied these records are in its possession. \nInstead the NSA refuses to confirm or deny the existence of these records. This is known \nas a “Glomar” response. A Glomar response, as recognized in Phillippi v. CIA, 546 F.2d \n1009 (D.C. Cir. 1976), permits an agency to “neither confirm nor deny” the existence of \nthe records sought. However, the use of a Glomar response is limited. It can only be \ninvoked when the material's nature justifies secrecy and the agency provides “as much \ninformation as possible” to justify its claim. Further, an agency cannot give a Glomar \nresponse when it has already disclosed the existence of the records being sought. \n10. Here there have been clear public admissions that the NSA has collected telephone and \ntext message metadata, the very records requesters have sought. \n11. The requested metadata is of significant public interest as it will shed light on ongoing \ncontroversies over widespread use by senior officials of non-official email accounts for  \nwork-related correspondence; the increased use of text messaging as an alternative to \nemail which, like non-official accounts, are generally not searched in response to FOIA \nor congressional requests seeking work-related “records”; and the admitted widespread \ndestruction of such text correspondence.1  \n                                                 \n1 See, e.g., Landmark Legal Foundation v. EPA, 959 F.Supp.2d 175, 181 (D.D.C. 2013) (“EPA did not \nsearch the personal email accounts of the Administrator, the Deputy Administrator, or the Chief of Staff” \ndespite “evidence that upper-level EPA officials conducted official business from their personal email \naccounts”); Answer in CEI v. EPA, D.D.C. No. 13-779 (filed 7/19/2013) at ¶21 (admitting EPA provides \nsuch officials “with personal digital assistants that have text messaging capability”), ¶¶14, 33 (EPA \ncurrently unable to locate such records); Email from Michelle Lo, EPA counsel, to Chris Horner & Hans \nBader (CEI counsel), at 9/9/2013 3:46 PM (admitting “Ms. McCarthy uses text messaging,” but arguing  \n“they were not required to be preserved by the Agency”); Email from Lo to Horner & Bader, at 8/1/2013 \n7:25 PM  (conceding “Ms. McCarthy used the texting function on her EPA phone,” and “none of her texts \nover the period encompassing the 18 specific dates at issue in CEI’s FOIA request . . . were preserved”).  \n4 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00975-JEB   Document 1   Filed 06/09/14   Page 5 of 20\n \n12. A Glomar response to a FOIA request is considered a constructive denial of the request. \nDefendant has given a Glomar response to the initial request and the appeal of both the \nFOIA requests made. This has exhausted all of requesters’ administrative remedies. \n13. NSA failed to respond to the appeal of the initial determinations by FME Law and E&E \nLegal within the 20 day period mandated under FOIA, and under § 552(a)(6)(A)(ii)(VIII) \nNSA has waived the opportunity to seek fees for the request. The NSA has failed to \nrespond entirely to the administrative appeal made by CEI, and therefore under § \n552(a)(6)(A)(ii)(VIII) NSA has waived the opportunity to seek fees for the request. \n14. Defendant is now legally obligated to produce records responsive to plaintiffs’ requests. \nPARTIES \n12. Plaintiff CEI is a public policy research and educational institute in Washington, D.C., \ndedicated to advancing responsible regulation and in particular economically sustainable \nenvironmental policy. CEI’s programs include research, investigative journalism and \npublication, as well as a transparency initiative seeking public records relating to \nenvironmental policy and how policymakers use public resources. \n13. Plaintiff E&E Legal is a nonprofit research, public policy and public interest litigation \ncenter incorporated in Virginia with Washington, D.C. offices.  It is dedicated to \nadvancing responsible regulation and especially economically sustainable environmental \npolicy. Its programs include analysis, publication, and a transparency initiative seeking \npublic records relating to environmental and energy policy and how policymakers use \npublic resources. \n14. Plaintiff FME Law is a nonprofit research, public policy, and public interest litigation \ncenter based in Virginia and dedicated to advancing responsible regulation and in \n5 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00975-JEB   Document 1   Filed 06/09/14   Page 6 of 20\n \nparticular economically sustainable environmental policy. FME Law’s programs include \nresearch, publication and litigation, and a transparency initiative seeking public records \nrelating to environmental and energy policy and how policymakers use public resources.  \nIt regularly and broadly disseminates responsive public information to the public at large. \n15. Defendant NSA is a federal agency which engages in intelligence gathering activities. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n16. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B), because this action is \nbrought in the District of Columbia, and 28 U.S.C. § 1331, because the resolution of \ndisputes under FOIA presents a federal question. \n17. Venue is proper in this Court under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) and 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) \nbecause Plaintiff CEI resides in the District of Columbia, and defendant is a federal \nagency. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n18. Transparency in government is the subject of high-profile promises from the president \nand attorney general of the United States arguing forcefully against agencies failing to \nlive up to their legal recordkeeping and disclosure obligations. Attorney General Holder \nstates, inter alia, “On his first full day in office, January 21, 2009, President Obama \nissued a memorandum to the heads of all departments and agencies on the Freedom of \nInformation Act (FOIA). The President directed that FOIA ‘should be administered with \na clear presumption: In the face of doubt, openness prevails.’” OIP Guidance, President \nObama’s FOIA Memorandum and Attorney General Holder’s FOIA Guidelines, Creating \na “New Era of Open Government,” www.justice.gov/oip/foiapost/2009foiapost8.htm. \n6 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00975-JEB   Document 1   Filed 06/09/14   Page 7 of 20\n \n19. Lisa P. Jackson is EPA's former Administrator.  Previous FOIA requests revealed that she \nused an EPA.gov email in a false identity of “Richard Windsor” for certain official \ncorrespondence.  Plaintiff CEI has also demonstrated that she used her personal Verizon \nemail and an (ATT) Blackberry email address for EPA-related correspondence, without \nfollowing the legal requirement to forward such correspondence to her official EPA \naccounts. Such communications involving EPA business remained federal records subject \nFOIA regardless of which account on which they were performed, and the decision to use \nthis account as her means of corresponding on Agency-related issues with select lobbyists \nalso made this account subject to FOIA and FRA. \n20. Gina McCarthy is the current Administrator of the EPA.  She was provided with text \nmessage capabilities in order to conduct agency business.  She subsequently engaged in \nthousands of text message communications.  CEI later submitted FOIA requests for those \ntext messages. It did so after information came to light showing that agency business had \nbeen communicated by text message.2 However, EPA provided a “no records” response \nto CEI’s requests for text messages on eighteen specific dates and then for all text \nmessages over an approximately three-year period, claiming that all text messages had \nbeen personal, and that all had been deleted or destroyed.3  CEI later demonstrated that \nMs. McCarthy’s text correspondents in fact included her EPA senior staff, including Joe \n                                                 \n2 See, e.g., Complaint in CEI v. EPA, D.D.C. Civil Action No. 13-1074.  \n3 See Answer in CEI v. EPA, D.D.C. No. 13-779 (filed 7/19/2013) at ¶ 8 (conceding that such texts were \nsent by EPA Assistant Administrator Gina McCarthy), ¶21 (conceding that EPA provides such officials \n“with personal digital assistants that have text messaging capability”), ¶¶14, 33 (EPA currently unable to \nlocate such records); Email from Michelle Lo, counsel for EPA, to Chris Horner and Hans Bader, counsel \nfor CEI, at 9/9/2013 3:46 PM (admitting that “Ms. McCarthy uses text messaging,” but arguing that “they \nwere not required to be preserved by the Agency.”); Email from Michelle Lo, counsel for EPA, to Chris \nHorner and Hans Bader, counsel for CEI, at 8/1/2013 7:25 PM (conceding that “Ms. McCarthy used the \ntexting function on her EPA phone,” and that “none of her texts over the period encompassing the 18 \nspecific dates at issue in CEI’s FOIA request (July 9, 2009, to June 29, 2012) were preserved”). \n7 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00975-JEB   Document 1   Filed 06/09/14   Page 8 of 20\n \nGoffman, Peter Tsirigotis, Steven Page, and eight others.  CEI sought their copies of such \ntext messages but EPA has refused to provide those. See CEI v. EPA, D.D.C. No. 14-582 \n(KBJ) (re FOIA request # EPA-HQ-2014-002006). EPA further claimed that it still \npossesses only several months of metadata regarding Ms. McCarthy’s text messages. \n21. In addition to EPA acknowledging destroying the entire class of Ms. McCarthy’s text \nmessages and those sent to or from Ms. Jackson that plaintiff CEI learned of and \nrequested, plaintiffs and others have exposed other practices by many executive branch \nemployees frustrating the public’s ability to “know what their government is up to.” \nReporters Committee, 489 U.S. at 773. These include using non-official email accounts to \nconduct official or work-related correspondence; falsely claiming work related \ncorrespondence was personal; and using unofficial email accounts to covertly \ncommunicate with former colleagues and their contacts, who share an interest in what is \nnow the employee’s official business, without creating the official record required by \nfederal statute and regulation (e.g., the FRA, the E-Government Act of 2002, 36 C.F.R. \nSubchapter B, Records Management, and National Archives and Records Administration \n(NARA) mandated guidance).4   \n                                                 \n4 For example plaintiff has learned of 18 senior EPA officials engaging in this practice, as well as former \nor current officials in the Departments of Energy and Treasury, and OSTP.  See, e.g., Judson Berger, EPA \nofficial scrutinized over emails to resign, FoxNews.com, February 19, 2013, \nwww.foxnews.com/politics/2013/02/19/epa-official-scrutinized-over-emails-to-resign/; Jim Snyder, \nBrightsource Warned Of Embarrassment To Obama In Loan Delay, Bloomberg, June 6, 2012, \nwww.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-06/brightsource-warned-of-embarrassment-to-obama-from-loan-\ndelays.html; Eric Lichtblau, Across From White House, Coffee With Lobbyists, New York Times, June \n24, 2010, at A18, www.nytimes.com/2010/06/25/us/politics/25caribou.html (lobbyists “routinely get e-\nmail messages from White House staff members’ personal accounts rather than from their official White \nHouse accounts, which can become subject to public review”); Senate EPW Committee, Minority Report, \nA Call for Sunshine: EPA’s FOIA and Federal Records Failures Uncovered (Sept. 9, 2013) at 8, \nwww.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&FileStore_id=513a8b4f-abd7-40ef-\na43b-dec0081b5a62; August 14, 2012 Letter from U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government \nReform Chairman Darrell Issa and subcommittee Chairmen Jim Jordan and Trey Gowdy to Energy \n \n8 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00975-JEB   Document 1   Filed 06/09/14   Page 9 of 20\n \n22. Such efforts to circumvent the FRA and FOIA by using personal email or phone systems, \nor by claiming official messages are personal, do not alter the legal character of these \ncommunications. They are and remain federal records.  Efforts to keep such records from \nbeing preserved by agencies frustrates federal record-keeping and disclosure laws. See \nLandmark Legal Foundation v. E.P.A., 2013 WL 4083285, *6 (D.D.C. Aug. 14, 2013). \n23. The NSA is known to have a program to collect metadata from telephone, text message \nand email records from certain telephony carriers including Verizon. NSA has revealed \nthat it collects such information under its Business Records FISA, Section 215 program.5 \nThe NSA Inspector General further admitted the NSA gathers this type of information.6 \nVerizon has acknowledged it provided the NSA with this type of metadata. The President \nof the United States has stated that the NSA collects metadata of this type as well. 7 \nFOIA Request by CEI — NSA FOIA 75854 \n24. On December 16, 2013 CEI submitted a FOIA request to the NSA. \n25. The request sought: \n \n“copies of 1) all text message data, and 2) particularly all metadata (date, duration and \ntime of the communication, sender and recipient, etc.) of text messaging activity using \n \nVerizon voice and/or data accounts in NSA’s possessionfor the \n                                                                                                                                                             \nSecretary Steven Chu, http://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2012-08-14-DEI-Gowdy-\nJordan-to-Chu-re-loan-program-emails.pdf (“at least fourteen DOE officials used non-government \naccounts to communicate about the loan guarantee program and other public business”); Promises Made, \nPromises Broken: The Obama Administration’s Disappointing Transparency Track Record, report by the \nU.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce, Vol. 1, Issue 3, July 31, 2012, \nhttp://republicans.energycommerce.house.gov/Media/file/PDFs/20120731WHTransparencyStaffReport.p\ndf. \n5 National Security Agency, Statement, “NSA: Missions, Authorities, Oversight and Partnerships,” Aug. 9, \n2013 (www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/speeches_testimonies/2013_08_09_the_nsa_story.pdf). \n6 The NSA has revealed in a letter to Senator Charles Grassley that this same type of \nmetadata was collected and reviewed. Letter from Dr. George Ellard, Inspector General, Natl. \nSecurity Agency, to Senator Charles Grassley, Ranking Member, S. Comm. on the Judiciary, \nSept. 11, 2013, available at www.nsa.gov/public_info/press_room/2013/grassley_letter.pdf. \n7 http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/07/statement-president. \n9 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00975-JEB   Document 1   Filed 06/09/14   Page 10 of 20\n \nphone/PDA/text/instant message account(s) associated with the number (202) 596-\n0247, a number assigned by Verizon to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n(note: for most or all of the relevant period this account was held in the name of ‘F. \nRusincovitch/Eon 8344’ but provided over the time period relevant to this request to \nthen- Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, and now-Administrator, Regina \n“Gina”McCarthy). Responsive records will be for billing periods ending, and/or will \nbe dated, during the period from July 1, 2009 through April 2011 (inclusive), at which \ntime EPA switched providers for these relevant offices, from Verizon to AT&T.” \n \n26. The NSA received this request December 17, 2013, and assigned it FOIA Case Number \n75854. \n27. On December 20, 2013 the NSA responded with an initial determination, in which it \ndeclined to provide the requested information, and instead refused to confirm or deny that \nit possessed the request records- a “Glomar” response. The NSA further claimed the \nauthority to give such a response under the First and Third exceptions to FOIA. \n28. In its Glomar response the NSA stated, in pertinent part:                                    \n \n“Although these two programs have been publicly acknowledged, details about them \nremain classified and/ or protected from release by statutes to prevent harm to the \nnational security of the United States.  To the extent that your request seeks any \ninformation on all text message data and particularly all metadata of text messaging \nactivity for the number (202) 596-0247 in relation to NSA intelligence programs, or in \nrelation to any specific methods or means for conducting the programs, we cannot \nacknowledge the existence or non-existence of such information. Any positive or \nnegative response on a request by-request basis would allow our adversaries to \naccumulate information and draw conclusions about NSA's technical capabilities, \nsources, and methods. Our adversaries are likely to evaluate all public responses related \nto these programs.  Were we to provide positive or negative responses to requests such as \nyours, our adversaries' compilation of the  information provided would  reasonably be \nexpected to cause exceptionally grave  damage to the  national security. Therefore, your \nrequest is denied because the fact of the existence or non-existence of responsive records \nis a currently and properly classified matter in accordance with Executive Order 13526, \nas set forth in Subparagraph (c) of Section 1.4.   Thus, your request is denied pursuant to \nthe  first  exemption of the FOIA, which provides that the  FOIA does not  apply to \nmatters that are specifically authorized under criteria established  by an Executive Order \nto be kept  secret in the  interest of national defense or foreign relations and are properly \nclassified pursuant  to such Executive Order. Moreover, the third exemption of the FOIA \nprovides for the withholding of information specifically protected from disclosure by \nstatute.  Thus, your request is also denied because the fact of the existence or non-\n10 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00975-JEB   Document 1   Filed 06/09/14   Page 11 of 20\n \nexistence of the information is exempted from disclosure pursuant to the third exemption. \nThe specific statutes applicable in this case are: Title 18 U.S.  Code 798; Title 50 U.S.  \nCode 3024(i) (formerly Title 50 U.S.  Code 403-1(i)); and Section 6, Public Law 86-36 \n(50 U.S. Code 3605, formerly 50 U.S. Code 402 note).”  \n \n \n29. The FOIA request never sought details about the NSA programs or activities. Instead it \nmerely sought metadata about communications which were already federal records by \nvirtue of having been used by Gina McCarthy, Administrator of the EPA to engage in \nwork-related business. \n30. On February 10, 2014 CEI administratively appealed the initial determination, noting that \nthe existence of the NSA program to collect metadata had already been made public, thus \nwaiving the right of the agency to issue a Glomar response, and that no classified details \nregarding the program had been sought or requested. \n31. On March 27, 2014 the NSA’s appeal authority for FOIA requests rejected the appeal, \nand reissued the Glomar response, stating “I have concluded that the appropriate response \nis to continue to neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of any \nintelligence material” relating to the identified phone number in CEI’s request. This \nresponse exhausted all administrative remedies requesters could pursue.  \n32. The NSA failed to respond to CEI’s administrative appeal within the 20 day time limit \nestablished under 5 U.S.C.S. § 552(a)(6)(A). As a consequence of failing to meet the \nlegally mandated timeframe for issuing a response, the NSA has waived any right to seek \nfees under § 552(a)(6)(A)(ii)(VIII) \nFOIA Request by E&E Legal and FME Law — NSA FOIA 74398 \n33. On August 16, 2013, E&E legal and FME Law submitted a FOIA request to the NSA. \n34. The request sought: \n11 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00975-JEB   Document 1   Filed 06/09/14   Page 12 of 20\n \n“copies of all metadata (duration and time of the communication, sender and recipient, \netc.) from Verizon voice and/or data accounts in NSA’s possession2  for the \nphone/PDA/text/instant message and/or email account(s) held by Lisa P. Jackson. To \nproperly identify the individual at issue in this matter, one such email account associated \nwith Ms. Jackson’s Verizon account and which was used to conduct public business is \nLisaPJackson@Verizon.net. Due to the dates of this account’s activity we expect the \ntelephone account likely carries an area code assigned to Washington, DC; however, it is \npossible it bears one of the New Jersey area codes.” \n \n35. The NSA received this request August 19, 2013, and assigned it FOIA Case Number \n74398. \n36. On August 23, 2013 the NSA responded with an initial determination, in which it \ndeclined to provide the requested information, and instead refused to confirm or deny that \nit possessed the request records- a “Glomar” response. The NSA further claimed the \nauthority to give such a response under the First and Third exceptions to FOIA. \n37. In its Glomar response the NSA stated, in pertinent part, essentially the same passage \nquoted above in paragraph 28.  For example, it likewise contained the statement,  \n“Although these two programs have been publicly acknowledged, details about them \nremain classified and/or protected from release by statutes to prevent harm to the national \nsecurity of the United States.”   \n \nIt contained the same quoted passage set forth in paragraph 28, except for one sentence: \nin lieu of the second sentence in that quoted passage,8 it contained this sentence instead:  \n“To the extent that your request seeks any information on Lisa P. Jackson in relation to \nNSA intelligence programs, or in relation to any specific methods or means for \nconducting the programs, we cannot acknowledge the existence or non-existence of such \ninformation.”  \n \n                                                 \n8 That second sentence read, “To the extent that your request seeks any information on all text message \ndata and particularly all metadata of text messaging activity for the number (202) 596-0247 in relation to \nNSA intelligence programs, or in relation to any specific methods or means for conducting the programs, \nwe cannot acknowledge the existence or non-existence of such information.” \n12 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00975-JEB   Document 1   Filed 06/09/14   Page 13 of 20\n \n38. The FOIA request never sought details about the NSA programs or activities. Instead it \nmerely sought metadata about communications which were already federal records by \nvirtue of having been used by Lisa P. Jackson to engage in work-related business while \nAdministrator of the EPA. \n39. On October 23, 2013 FME Law and E&E Legal administratively appealed the initial \ndetermination, noting that the existence of the NSA program to collect metadata had \nalready been made public, thus waiving the agency's right to issue a Glomar response, \nand that no classified details regarding the program had been sought or requested. \n40. On March 27, 2014 the NSA’s appeal authority for FOIA requests rejected the appeal, \nand reissued the Glomar response, stating “I have concluded that the appropriate response \nis to continue to neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of any \nintelligence material.” This response exhausted all administrative remedies requesters \ncould pursue. \n41. NSA failed to respond to requesters' appeal within the 20 day time limit established under \n5 U.S.C.S. § 552(a)(6)(A). As a consequence of failing to meet the legally mandated \ntimeframe for issuing a response, the NSA has waived any right to seek fees under § \n552(a)(6)(A)(ii)(VIII). \nLegal Discussion \n42. FOIA has the broadest definition of “record” among the relevant federal statutes.   “The \ndefinition of a record under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is broader than the \ndefinition under the Federal Records Act.” See, e.g., EPA, What Is a Federal Record?, \nwww.epa.gov/records/tools/toolkits/procedures/part2.htm. It covers emails in an \nemployee’s personal email account if their subject relates to official business. See, e.g., \n13 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00975-JEB   Document 1   Filed 06/09/14   Page 14 of 20\n \nSenate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Minority Report, A Call for \nSunshine: EPA’s FOIA and Federal Records Failures Uncovered (Sept. 9, 2013) at 8 \nwww.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&FileStore_id=513a8b4f\n-abd7-40ef-a43b-dec0081b5a62. \n43. The status of a record, whether it be email, telephone, or text message, is not dictated by \nthe account on which it is created or received. \n44. Agencies are increasingly called to search an employee’s private accounts and \nequipment. For example, plaintiff has recently confronted this issue in other instances \ninvolving EPA Regional Administrators. Defendant ultimately produced former Region 8 \nAdministrator James Martin’s work-related ME.com emails to and from the \nenvironmentalist pressure group Environmental Defense (previously Environmental \nDefense Fund) addressing work-related issues. See CEI v. EPA,  D.D.C., C.A. No. 12-\n1497 (ESH)(FOIA 08-FOI-00203-12). \n45. With regard to private accounts “Agencies are also required to address the use of external \ne-mail systems that are not controlled by the agency (such as private e-mail accounts on \ncommercial systems such as Gmail, Hotmail, Mac, etc.).  Where agency staff have access \nto external systems, agencies must ensure that federal records sent or received on such \nsystems are preserved in the appropriate recordkeeping system and that reasonable steps \nare taken to capture available transmission and receipt data needed by the agency for \nrecordkeeping purposes.” United States Government Accountability Office, “Report to \nthe Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate: NATIONAL ARCHIVES \nAND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION. Oversight and Management Improvements \n14 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00975-JEB   Document 1   Filed 06/09/14   Page 15 of 20\n \nInitiated, but More Action Needed,” GAO-11-15, October 2010, \nwww.gao.gov/assets/320/310933.pdf, p. 37. \n46. The records created by Lisa P. Jackson which reflect public business were federal records \ndespite her decision to use a private account to correspond with lobbyists on EPA-related \nmatters. The records created by Gina McCarthy while using an EPA provided device to \nengage in text messaging were likewise public records.  \n47. The NSA’s acquisition of metadata regarding these communications resulted in the NSA \nacquiring federal records regarding correspondence by EPA employees, and which \nshould have been preserved by the EPA. Regardless, the NSA’s acquisition of these \nmetadata records did not diminish the status of this information but made NSA’s copies \nrecords under the FRA and FOIA, subject to release, public scrutiny and transparency. \n48. The NSA failed to give a proper response to plaintiffs’ requests for records. FOIA \nprovides that a requesting party is entitled to a substantive agency response both to \nrequests and administrative appeals within 20 working days, affirming the agency is \nprocessing the request made and intends to comply. It must rise to the level of indicating \n“that the agency is exercising due diligence in responding to the request...Upon any \ndetermination by an agency to comply with a request for records, the records shall be \nmade promptly available to such person making such request.” 5 U.S.C.§ 552(a)(6)(C)(i). \nAlternately, the agency must cite “exceptional circumstances” and request, and make the \ncase for, an extension that is necessary and proper to the specific request. See also Open \nAmerica v. Watergate Special Prosecution Force, 547 F.2d 605 (D.C. Cir. 1976). \n49. A substantive agency response means that a covered agency must provide particularized \nassurance that it is reviewing some quantity of records with an eye toward production on \n15 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00975-JEB   Document 1   Filed 06/09/14   Page 16 of 20\n \nsome estimated schedule, so as to establish some reasonable belief that it is processing \nour request. 5 U.S.C.A. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i). See also Muttitt v. U.S. Central Command, 813 \nF. Supp.2d 221, 227 (D.D.C. 2011) (noting “statutory requirement that [agencies] provide \nestimated dates of completion”). Defendant must at least gather, review, and inform a \nrequesting party of the scope of potentially responsive records, including the scope of the \nrecords it plans to produce and the scope of documents that it plans to withhold under any \nFOIA exemptions. See CREW v. FEC, 711 F.3d 180, 186 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (“CREW”). \n50. The decision by NSA to provide a Glomar response, to neither confirm its possession of \nthe records and provide them (subject to any legitimate withholdings under FOIA \nexceptions), nor deny its possession of them, was not a legitimate or proper response. \n51. A Glomar response is ordinarily appropriate where confirming or denying the existence \nof records would reveal the existence of a program not know to the public. Here, \nhowever, the existence of a data collection program designed to gather metadata has been \nacknowledged by the President, and by the NSA itself and its Inspector General. \n52. An agency may not issue a Glomar response when the program such a response is \nattempting to keep secret has already been publicly acknowledged. The President of the \nUnited States has ultimate authority over executive matters. His admission that such an \nNSA program exists9 definitively waives the secrecy of such a program. It is well \nestablished that once the secrecy of the existence of data has been waived, a Glomar \nresponse is not appropriate.10 \n                                                 \n9 See http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/07/statement-president. \n10 See Nat'l Sec. Archive, No. 99-1160, slip op. at 15-16, 19 (D.D.C. July 31, 2000) (CIA waived Glomar \nresponse as to request for CIA biographies of former leaders of Eastern European countries through \nprevious admissions that agency compiles “biographies on all heads of state”). \n16 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00975-JEB   Document 1   Filed 06/09/14   Page 17 of 20\n \n53. Plaintiffs have not sought records which would give away details regarding how such a \ndata collection program operates. Such information justifiable remains secret and not \nsubject to FOIA. Plaintiffs have only sought metadata records regarding communications \nmade by another federal agency, which that agency had an obligation to preserve. EPA \nand its employees have no expectation of privacy with regard to federal records, and did \nnot gain such an expectation by destroying instead of preserving these federal records and \nthe metadata regarding these federal records. \n54. As a result, defendant issuing a Glomar response to plaintiffs’ FOIA requests was not an \nadequate or appropriate response, and defendant still owes a proper and substantive \nagency response to the requests. \nFirst Claim for Relief \nRelease of FOIA Records Requested in NSA FOIA 74398 — Declaratory Judgment \n55. Plaintiffs re-allege paragraphs 1-54 as if fully set out herein. \n56. Plaintiffs are owed an adequate, non-conflicted search and production responsive to the \nrequest for federal records created by, for or relating to EPA business and in the \npossession of the NSA. \n57. NSA’s Glomar response to plaintiffs’ FOIA requests was not appropriate given that there \nwas prior disclosure of the NSA’s program to collect metadata and that plaintiffs did not \nseek classified details regarding this program. \n58. Plaintiffs have exhausted all administrative remedies. \n59. Plaintiffs ask this Court to enter a judgment declaring that: \na. the metadata records sought by plaintiffs in the possession of defendant are federal \nrecords subject to FOIA; \nb. The Glomar response issued by defendant was not a proper response; \n17 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00975-JEB   Document 1   Filed 06/09/14   Page 18 of 20\n \nc. Defendant has failed to adequately respond to the FOIA request; \nd. Defendants failure to properly respond to the FOIA request seeking the described \nrecords is not reasonable, and does not satisfy its obligations under FOIA; \ne. Defendant’s refusal to produce the requested records is unlawful; and \nf. Defendant must release the requested records. \nSecond Claim for Relief \nRelease of FOIA Records Requested in NSA FOIA 74398 — Injunctive Relief \n60. Plaintiffs re-allege paragraphs 1-59 as if fully set out herein. \n61. Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief compelling defendant to produce all records \nresponsive to its request described, supra. \n62. Plaintiffs ask this Court to enter an injunction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) \nenjoining defendant from further withholding responsive records and ordering the \ndefendant to produce to plaintiffs within 10 business days of the date of the order the \nrequested records, or a detailed Vaughn index claiming FOIA exemptions applicable to \nthe withheld information. \n63. Further, that this Court shall retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the order as well as \nretain jurisdiction to conduct such further proceedings and award relief as may be \nnecessary to resolve any breach of the order and to retain jurisdiction over any motions \nseeking judicial review of some or all withheld and/or redacted documents. \nThird Claim for Relief \nRelease of FOIA Records Requested in NSA FOIA 75854 — Declaratory Judgment \n64. Plaintiffs re-allege paragraphs 1-63 as if fully set out herein. \n18 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00975-JEB   Document 1   Filed 06/09/14   Page 19 of 20\n \n65. Plaintiffs are owed an adequate, non-conflicted search and production responsive to the \nrequest for federal records created by, for or relating to EPA business and in the \npossession of the NSA. \n66. NSA’s Glomar response to plaintiffs FOIA request was not appropriate given that there \nwas prior disclosure of the NSA’s program to collect metadata and that plaintiffs did not \nseek classified details regarding this program. \n67. Plaintiffs have exhausted all administrative remedies. \n68. Plaintiffs ask this Court to enter a judgment declaring that: \na. the metadata records sought by plaintiffs in the possession of defendant are federal \nrecords subject to FOIA; \nb. The Glomar response issued by defendant was not a proper response; \nc. Defendant has failed to adequately respond to the FOIA request; \nd. Defendants failure to properly respond to the FOIA request seeking the described \nrecords is not reasonable, and does not satisfy its obligations under FOIA; \ne. Defendant’s refusal to produce the requested records is unlawful; and \nf. Defendant must release the requested records \nFourth Claim for Relief \nRelease of FOIA Records Requested in NSA FOIA 75854 — Injunctive Relief \n \n69. Plaintiffs re-allege paragraphs 1-68 as if fully set out herein. \n70. Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief compelling defendant to produce all records \nresponsive to its request described, supra. \n71. Plaintiffs ask this Court to enter an injunction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) \nenjoining defendant from further withholding responsive records and ordering the \ndefendant to produce to plaintiffs within 10 business days of the date of the order the \n19 \n\nCase 1:14-cv-00975-JEB   Document 1   Filed 06/09/14   Page 20 of 20\n \nrequested records, or a detailed Vaughn index claiming FOIA exemptions applicable to \nthe withheld information. \n72. Further, that this Court shall retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the order as well as \nretain jurisdiction to conduct such further proceedings and award relief as may be \nnecessary to resolve any breach of the order and to retain jurisdiction over any motions \nseeking judicial review of some or all withheld and/or redacted documents. \nFifth Claim for Relief \nCosts And Fees – Injunctive Relief \n \n73. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(E), the Court may assess against the United States \nreasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case under \nthis section in which the complainant has substantially prevailed. \n74. This Court should enter an injunction ordering defendant to pay reasonable attorney fees \nand other litigation costs reasonably incurred in this case. \n75. Plaintiffs have a statutory right to the records that they seek, defendant has not fulfilled \nits statutory obligations to provide them, and there is no legal basis for withholding them. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request the declaratory and injunctive relief herein sought, and an \naward of attorney fees and costs, and such other and further relief as the Court shall deem proper. \nRespectfully submitted this 9th day of June, 2014, \n     \n____________________________ \nHans Bader, D.C.
