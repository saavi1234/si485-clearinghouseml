Ms. Rifkin may ask questions regarding Dr. Fithian's compensation and net worth. The court will also permit questions regarding the date of formation of Southwest Corrections Medical Group and Correctional Medical Group Company and what relationship Dr. Fithian had with these companies at the time Mr. Claypole suffered his injuries. In order to explore what relationship Dr. Fithian may have formed following the events at issue, Plaintiff will first need to lay foundation that these entities were formed at the time of the incidents.

    "summary": "<p>On June 12, 2014, the mother of a pretrial detainee who committed suicide while in jail filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiff sued the County of San Mateo, the Mateo County Sheriff, the County of Monterey, the Monterey County Sheriff, the City of Monterey, the Monterey Police, the California Forensic Medical Group, and the Community Hospital of Monterey Peninsula under 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983 and 1988, as well as state law. Represented by private counsel, she asked the court for monetary relief, claiming violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Specifically, she alleged failures to provide medical care, to protect from harm, and to furnish medical care. She also claimed a deprivation of substantive due process, medical malpractice, negligent supervision, training, hiring, and retention, and wrongful death.</p><p>In 2013, the detainee committed suicide while in his administrative segregation cell at the Monterey County Jail by hanging himself with a bed sheet. The detainee had a history of mental illness and had been arrested three days prior for a murder he committed during a bipolar episode. The plaintiff alleged that the Jail's policies and practices for screening, supervising, and treating prisoners at risk for suicide were inadequate. The plaintiff also alleged serious deficiencies in the delivery of mental health care at the Jail. The detainee had been previously detained at the Jail and had not received adequate mental health care. </p><p>On October 9, 2014, the District Court granted in part Monterey City's and Monterey County's motions to dismiss with leave to amend to the complaint. The Court also denied the County's motion to strike. On October 28, 2014, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint adding a claim of general negligence and allegations to other claims against Monterey and Monterey County. Then, on November 19, 2014, Judge Labson Freeman denied the Hospital's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. </p><p>On September 22, 2015, Judge Freeman approved the stipulated dismissal of the County and the Sheriff as defendants. Two days later, she approved the stipulated dismissal of the Hospital as a defendant.  Presumably these were based on out-of-court settlements.  </p><p>The case proceeded against the remaining defendants. On January 12, 2016, the court granted summary judgment for a defendant police officer and denied summary judgment for defendant Monterey City. The court found that the plaintiffs had indicated an intention to dismiss the police officer and did not oppose summary judgment as to him. With respect to the City, the court held that there was a dispute as to the issue of whether or not the City \"lacks minimally necessary policies and procedures for identifying a detaineeโs mental health issues and responding to those issues appropriately by either transferring the detainee to a mental health facility or transmitting information regarding the detaineeโs mental health to the next custodian.\"</p><p>On February 22, 2016, the court granted partial summary judgment for county defendants and medical defendants. </p><p>The parties then progressed toward trial, but on March 28, 2016, the parties indicated they had reached settlement. Accordingly, they moved for voluntary dismissal two days later, which the court granted while retaining jurisdiction over the settlement's enforcement. </p><p>The court related this case to Estate of Sandra Vela v. County of Monterey, No. 5:16-cv-02375, on May 12, 2016.</p><p>The settlement is not publicly available, though a status report indicates that \"[t]he Agreement required payment of all funds by June 24, 2016, as well as the return of Mr. Claypoleโs personal property and handwritten suicide note by that date.\" There has been no further docket activity since July 2016. The case is now closed.</p>",

On May 4, 2013, 20-year-old Joshua Claypole committed suicide in a \n3  cell at Monterey County Jail by hanging himself from a bed sheet. Three days prior, \n4  Claypole had been arrested for the fatal stabbing of Daniel Garcia Huerta, a taxi \n5  driver, during a bipolar episode. These two tragic deaths should not have \n6  happenedโand would not have happenedโif Defendants in this case had fulfilled \n7  their duties as public safety agencies and followed policies and procedures that are \n8  standard in their fields and required by law.   \n9  2.    Defendants are California municipalities, Sheriffsโ departments, \n10  health care providers, and their employees. Each Defendant entity had multiple \n11  contacts with Claypole in the days before his death. Had Defendants followed \n12  standard protocols and training, they would have identified Claypoleโs acute mental \n13  health crisis and risk factors, and intervened to protect him and the public. \n14  However, Defendants did not have the appropriate policies and procedures in place, \n15  and ignored the obvious warning signs.  As a result, two families lost their loved \n16  ones.  \n17  3.  The Estate of Joshua Claypole and Claypoleโs mother, Silvia \n18  Guersenzvaig, bring this action for damages against Defendants for violations \n19  arising out of Defendantsโ deliberate indifference and negligence that caused the \n20  needless suffering and death of Joshua Claypole.  \n21  JURISDICTION \n22  4.  This Complaint seeks damages for violations of the civil rights, \n23  privileges, and immunities guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of \n24  the United States Constitution, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983 and 1988, and for \n25  violations of California state law.   \n26  5.  This Court has jurisdiction over this lawsuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n27  ยงยง 1331 and 1343. \n28  /// \n   \n-1- \n  COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-PSG   Document1   Filed06/12/14   Page4 of 30\n \n1  6.  This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims \n2  asserted herein pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367, because the claims form part of the \n3  same case or controversy arising under the United States Constitution and federal \n4  law. \n5  VENUE \n6  7.  Plaintiffsโ claims arose in the Counties of San Mateo and Monterey, \n7  California. Venue therefore lies in the Northern District of California pursuant to 28 \n8  U.S.C. ยง 1391(b)(2). \n9  8.  Rule 3 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rule 3-2(e) \n10  authorizes assignment to this division because a substantial part of the events or \n11  omissions giving rise to Plaintiffsโ claims occurred in the counties served by this \n12  division. \n13  PARTIES \n14  9.

History of Inadequate Mental Health Care in Monterey County Jail \n3  30.  County of Monterey and CFMG have been on notice that their \n4  provision of mental health care to inmates at the Monterey County Jail is \n5  inadequate and results in needless harm since at least 2007, when the Monterey \n6  County Sheriffโs Office and the Monterey County Board of Supervisors hired an \n7  outside consulting firm to perform a needs assessment for the Jail.  \n8  31.  The independent assessment was updated in 2011 and found County of \n9  Monterey and CFMGโs policies and practices for screening, supervising, and \n10  treating prisoners at risk for suicide inadequate. (See Exhibit 1.) The 2011 \n11  Assessment identified structural and design flaws of cells and dormitories that do \n12  not minimize suicide hazards in the facilities and fail to prevent self-harm. (See \n13  Exhibit 1 at EX.3.)  The Assessment also found that Monterey County Jailโs \n14  physical facilities lack sufficient treatment space and therefore prevent adequate \n15  delivery of medical and mental health care. (Exhibit 1 at EX.3, A.3.) \n16  32.  In addition to the Jailโs structural issues the Assessment found that \n17  chronic understaffing hinders County of Montereyโs ability to provide medical care, \n18  classify and move inmates within the facility, maintain inmate safety and security, \n19  and transport inmates to and from outside agencies. (Exhibit 1 at G.1โG.3, J.2โJ.3.) \n20  In addition, understaffing and overcrowding at the Jail creates what the Assessment \n21  called โan indirect supervision facility,โ which impairs the Jailโs ability to \n22  โrecognize, manage and treatโ mental health issues among the inmate population \n23  (as opposed to direct supervision from experienced physicians and psychologists). \n24  (Id. at EX.3.) \n25  33.  These deficiencies are even more troubling in light of the \n26  Assessmentโs finding that approximately 15โ20% of the Jailโs inmates suffer from \n27  mental health issues. (Exhibit 1 at A.3 n. 4.) \n28  /// \n   \n-9- \n  COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES\n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-PSG   Document1   Filed06/12/14   Page12 of 30\n \n1  34.  The Assessmentโs findings were confirmed in a 2013 draft report by an \n2  expert hired by County of Monterey, Dr. Richard Hayward (โHayward Reportโ).  \n3  (See Exhibit 2.) The County tasked Dr. Hayward with evaluating mental health care \n4  at Monterey County Jail in response to a federal class action lawsuit challenging \n5  County of Montereyโs provision of medical and mental health care at the Jail. See \n6  Hernandez v. Cnty. of Monterey, No. 13-cv-2354-PSG (N.D. Cal. filed May 23, \n7  2013). The Hayward Report, dated December 6, 2013, affirmed that understaffing \n8  of mental health professionals led to inadequate mental health care for inmates (see \n9  Exhibit 2 at 5), compounding the 2011 Assessmentโs findings of problems \n10  associated with crowded and space-limited clinics at the Jail. \n11  35.  In addition, the Hayward Report identified other serious deficiencies in \n12  the delivery of mental health care at the Monterey County Jail, including: \n13  a.  Lack of a complete mental health screening process that leads to \n14  inadequate identification of arrestees with a potential for self-harm or a history of \n15  mental disorders. (Exhibit 2 at 2.) \n16  b.  Lack of mental health questions on intake forms that could \n17  adequately log an inmateโs symptoms and treatment history, prior providers, past \n18  diagnoses and medications, and history of self-harm. (Exhibit 2 at 4.) \n19  c.  County of Monterey employs only a total of four mental health \n20  professionals, which the Hayward Report concluded was โinsufficient to meet the \n21  mental health needs of the inmates.โ (Exhibit 2 at 5.)  \n22  d.  Lack of mental health care clinicians assigned to the jail on \n23  weekends โresults in insufficient services to mentally ill inmates,โ relevant because \n24  Claypole committed suicide on a Saturday. (Exhibit 2 at 2.) \n25  e.  Inadequate supervision of inmates placed on suicide watch in \n26  designated โSafety Cells,โ including delays of up to an hour or more between \n27  checks of designated inmates who should be monitored twice each thirty minutes. \n28  (Exhibit 2 at 12.) \n   \n-10- \n  COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES\n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-PSG   Document1   Filed06/12/14   Page13 of 30\n \n1  36.  County of Montereyโs failures to timely identify, adequately treat, or \n2  effectively monitor prisoners at risk for suicide have had tragic consequences. \n3  According to the allegations contained in the Hernandez v. County of Monterey \n4  complaint, there had been three completed and over a dozen attempted suicides in \n5  the four years prior to Claypoleโs suicide. According to that complaint, the rate of \n6  completed suicides at the Monterey County Jail is nearly twice the national average \n7  for jail facilities.  \n8  37.  Moreover, on April 15, 2013, prior to Joshua Claypoleโs death, County \n9  of Monterey was again specifically put on notice of the serious problems with \n10  mental health treatment in the jail, as well as its disproportionately high suicide \n11  rate, in a letter written by Hernandez class counsel. (See Exhibit 3.)  \n12  II.  Joshua Claypoleโs Detentions and Suicide \n13  A.   Claypoleโs Mental Health History \n14  38.  Joshua Claypole was born in Monterey, California, and was raised \n15  primarily in Big Sur, California, by his mother Silvia Guersenzvaig.  \n16  39.  Starting in or around his junior year in high school, Claypole began \n17  struggling with substance abuse and exhibiting symptoms of mental illness, \n18  including anxiety, panic disorders, and bipolar disorder. He eventually dropped out \n19  of high school in December of his senior year.  \n20  40.  Guersenzvaig sought help for Claypole from numerous mental health \n21  therapists and practitioners from approximately 2010 through 2013.  \n22  41.  During this period, Claypole was treated by at least one psychiatrist at \n23  CHOMP, Dr. Marshal Alan Blatt. Dr. Blatt worked with Claypole between March \n24  2012 and August 2012, but abruptly terminated his relationship with Claypole with \n25  no follow up care or referral to another care provider. \n26  42.  In this time, Claypole would fluctuate between normative behavior and \n27  his more agitated, disturbed periods. When on his prescribed medications, he was \n28  funny, loving, creative, and thoughtful, often talking openly about his growth as a \n   \n-11- \n  COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES\n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-PSG   Document1   Filed06/12/14   Page14 of 30\n \n1  young adult and the lessons he learned from his past experience and from others. \n2  During periods of instability, however, he struggled with anxiety, aggression, and \n3  substance abuse. This behavior led to two arrests, one for a DUI and vandalism and \n4  the other for minor possession of cocaine. As part of his sentences for these arrests, \n5  Claypole successfully completed several rehabilitation programs. \n6  B.   First Detention in San Mateo County \n7  43.  Joshua Claypoleโs mental health issues came to a head in April 2013. \n8  On April 24, Silvia Guersenzvaig scheduled Claypole to see his treating \n9  psychiatrist, Dr. John R. Donaldson, on May 2. By approximately April 27, \n10  Claypole stopped sleeping, believed he had telepathy, and thought that others were \n11  communicating to him through their thoughts.  \n12  44.  Five days before the May 2 appointment with his psychiatrist, Joshua \n13  Claypole experienced a psychotic episode.  On April 28, 2013, while at his \n14  motherโs home, Claypole began acting strangely, exhibited aggressive and paranoid \n15  behavior, and left the home without telling Guersenzvaig where he was going.  \n16  45.  Claypole traveled to the home of friends that evening, but did not sleep \n17  the entire night. During the night, he told them he thought the singer of the music \n18  they were listening to was going to come out of the music to kill him.  \n19  46.  The next day, Claypole returned to his motherโs home, collected his \n20  belongings, and left without answering her questions about where he was going. He \n21  appeared agitated and paranoid.  \n22  47.  Worrying about her sonโs health, Silvia Guersenzvaig called Joshua \n23  Claypoleโs psychiatrist Dr. Donaldson on April 29 and spoke with his office staff \n24  about Claypoleโs behavior. She asked Dr. Donaldsonโs staff to provide further \n25  assistance to Claypole in his upcoming May 2 appointment.  \n26  48.  Guersenzvaig called Dr. Donaldsonโs office again on April 30, 2013, \n27  to confirm that Claypole would be receiving assistance and treatment from Dr. \n28  Donaldson at his appointment in two days.    \n   \n-12- \n  COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES\n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-PSG   Document1   Filed06/12/14   Page15 of 30\n \n1  49.  After leaving his motherโs home on April 29, records reflect that \n2  Joshua Claypole was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence at 1:00 \n3  a.m. on the morning of April 30, 2013, by California Highway Patrol officers in \n4  Redwood City, California. According to San Mateo Sheriffโs Department records, \n5  he was booked and detained at the Maguire Correctional Facility operated by \n6  County of San Mateo at approximately 4:30 a.m., and his car was impounded. A \n7  jail property slip indicates that he was arrested with medication in his possession, \n8  among other items.  \n9  50.  California Highway Patrol records indicate that CHP officers \n10  performed a narcotics test on Claypole, but San Mateo records do not reflect any \n11  review by San Mateo personnel of the test or its results.   \n12  51.  Although the San Mateo Arrest Report/Booking Sheet for Claypole \n13  noted that he was under the influence and his speech was slow and slurred, and the \n14  San Mateo Correctional Health Services Intake Sheet notes that his arrest was \n15  primarily for drug intoxication, San Mateo staffโs medical examination of Claypole \n16  checked โnoโ for โany signs of alcohol/drug intoxication and/or withdrawalโ and \n17  failed to check the box noting slurred speech.  \n18  52.  San Mateoโs medical records also indicate that Claypole reported his \n19  psychiatric history and prescriptions for medications including Adderall (prescribed \n20  primarily for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and Klonopin (prescribed to \n21  treat anxiety disorders, panic disorders, and psychosis) to the screening nurse at \n22  Maguire Correctional Facility. Adderall and Klonopin are known to have side \n23  effects including irritability and aggression, cognitive impairments and \n24  hallucinations, depression, suicidal thoughts, and mood swings.  According to San \n25  Mateoโs medical records, staff then prescribed Claypole three psychotropic \n26  medications: Hydroxyzine, Quetiapine, and Lithium Carbonate. All three \n27  medications are used to treat bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, psychosis, and mania. \n28  However, no referral for further medical health monitoring or treatment appears to \n   \n-13- \n  COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES\n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-PSG   Document1   Filed06/12/14   Page16 of 30\n \n1  have been made.   \n2  53.  Despite notice of Claypoleโs serious mental illness, erratic behavior, \n3  and the dangerous mix of narcotics and psychotropic medication he was suspected \n4  to have consumed, County of San Mateo released Joshua Claypole on April 30, \n5  2013, at 11:24 a.m. on the condition that he promise to appear for his DUI \n6  arraignment.  \n7  C.   Claypoleโs Repeated Visits to the CHOMP Facility Where He Had \n8    Previously Received Treatment \n9  54.  After his release from San Mateo, Joshua Claypole traveled south to \n10  Monterey.  \n11  55.  At approximately 8:30 a.m. on May 1, 2013, Joshua Claypole arrived \n12  at the Hartnell Professional Center, which houses CHOMP. He had been treated by \n13  CHOMP between March and August 2012, and that morning went to the outpatient \n14  behavioral health clinic on the second floor where he had previously been a patient. \n15  Despite CHOMPโs prior relationship with Claypole and his obvious symptoms of a \n16  mental health crisis, CHOMP personnel did not provide medical or mental health \n17  treatment to Claypole.  Rather, they directed Claypole to leave, and called the \n18  Monterey Police Department. By the time police officers arrived, Claypole had \n19  already left. \n20  56.  Joshua Claypole returned to CHOMP later that same morning at \n21  approximately 11:00 a.m. He again visited CHOMPโs behavioral health clinic. This \n22  time, CHOMP personnel responded by deploying their internal security officers to \n23  escort him out of the building, again failing to examine or treat Claypole. Despite \n24  their physical custody of Claypole, and awareness of his troubled mental state, \n25  CHOMP personnel refused to treat him, examine him, detain him, or provide any \n26  medical or mental health assistance to him. Instead, CHOMP security officers threw \n27  Claypole out of the building and again called the Monterey Police Department. \n28  /// \n   \n-14- \n  COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES\n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-PSG   Document1   Filed06/12/14   Page17 of 30\n \n1  57.  Immediately after CHOMP security officers physically ejected him, \n2  Claypole went to a local Wells Fargo bank branch in Monterey, presumably to \n3  obtain money for a rental car so he could return to Redwood City for his \n4  impounded car. Wells Fargo employees confirmed that his strange behavior was \n5  clearly observable, later telling Monterey Police Department officers that Claypole \n6  appeared to be โon a substance,โ โvery unstable,โ โout of it,โ and โin and out of \n7  consciousness.โ They stated that Claypole displayed mood changes and would at \n8  times be unresponsive to conversation. At the register of the bank, he did not talk \n9  and made strange movements with his head. After withdrawing money from a bank \n10  account he shared with his mother, Claypole requested Wells Fargo staff hale him a \n11  taxi cab. \n12  D.   Detention in Monterey County \n13  58.  According to Monterey Police Department reports, Claypole got into a  \n14  taxi shortly thereafter outside of the Wells Fargo branch, and, at approximately 1:10 \n15  p.m., fatally stabbed the taxi driver, Daniel Garcia Huerta, outside an Enterprise \n16  Rent-A-Car Company location on Del Monte Avenue in Monterey, California. \n17  Claypole was then detained by Seaside Police Department officers a short distance \n18  away in a stolen pickup truck. Monterey Police Department officers arrived at the \n19  scene thereafter and took custody of Claypole. After the owner of the pickup truck \n20  identified Claypole, Monterey Police Department personnel arrested him.  \n21  59.  According to police reports, when Claypole was seated in the back of \n22  Defendant MPD Officer Brent Hallโs squad car, he spontaneously asked Defendant \n23  Hall, โCan you ask for the [lethal] injection?โ He also told Defendant Hall, โI had \n24  to do it.โ \n25  60.  During the booking process, Claypole asked Defendant Hall โShould I \n26  go? I should just take the injection.โ  \n27  61.  While waiting to be interviewed by a detective, Joshua Claypole asked \n28  Hall โIs my mom going to get my remains?โ Claypole again told Hall that he \n   \n-15- \n  COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES\n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-PSG   Document1   Filed06/12/14   Page18 of 30\n \n1  wanted to die by lethal injection and that he wanted to have his body cremated.  \n2  62.  Despite these suicidal comments, neither Defendant Hall nor \n3  Defendant Monterey Police Department informed the Monterey County Sheriffโs \n4  Department that Joshua Claypole was acting strangely or a suicide risk. Rather than \n5  assessing his mental health issues adequately, or notifying the County of Monterey, \n6  his subsequent custodian, Defendants Hall and City of Monterey failed to take any \n7  appropriate or necessary action in the face of a clearly paranoid and suicidal \n8  detainee. \n9  63.  At approximately 8:30 p.m. on May 1, Joshua Claypole met with his \n10  criminal defense lawyer, John Klopfenstein. During the meeting, Claypole appeared \n11  paranoid and talked about killing himself. Klopfenstein then spoke to Officer Candi \n12  McGregor at the jail at approximately 8:45 p.m. and requested that Claypole be \n13  placed on suicide watch, per a memorandum drafted by McGregor. McGregor \n14  noted that she immediately contacted Defendant Sergeant E. Kaye, the on-duty \n15  Sergeant. Sergeant Kaye advised McGregor that she would follow up on the \n16  situation.  \n17  64.  According to County of Monterey records, an โIntake Health \n18  Screeningโ of Joshua Claypole was conducted at 9:05 p.m. on May 1, 2013. During \n19  the screening, Claypole told the screening deputy that he was taking medication for \n20  anxiety.  However, the screening form used to document the examination did not \n21  indicate that any questions were asked regarding Claypoleโs history of mental \n22  health diagnoses or prior mental health treatment. Despite Claypoleโs suicidal \n23  statements to the transporting police officers and reports from Claypoleโs lawyer to \n24  jail staff that Claypole was unstable and talked about killing himself, the Intake \n25  Health Screening shows the โnoโ box checked for โDoes behavior suggest a danger \n26  to self or others?โ  Similarly, despite Claypoleโs self-report that he took anxiety \n27  medications, the Intake Health Screening does not reflect any referral of Claypole \n28  to a psychiatrist or other mental health staff.   \n   \n-16- \n  COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES\n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-PSG   Document1   Filed06/12/14   Page19 of 30\n \n1  65.  County of Monterey Sheriffโs personnel also completed a form entitled \n2  โClassification Inmate Intake Screening Questionnaire,โ dated May 1, 2013, at 9:05 \n3  p.m. Notwithstanding the recent events, Claypoleโs statements to the police \n4  officers, Claypoleโs psychiatric history, and his attorneyโs report of suicidal \n5  symptoms and request to have him placed on suicide watch, the Questionnaire \n6  indicates that Claypole had not shown any bizarre behavior and that he was not now \n7  nor had he ever been under psychiatric care.  \n8  66.  Monterey County Jail staff failed to place Claypole on suicide watch \n9  on May 1, 2014, despite his attorneyโs direct report of suicidal symptoms and \n10  request for such precautions. \n11  67.  On May 2, Klopfenstein visited Claypole at the Jail. During this \n12  second meeting, Claypole asked Mr. Klopfenstein to have his mother bring his \n13  medications to the jail.  \n14  68.  On May 3, Joshua Claypole made his first appearance in court \n15  regarding the criminal charges. That same day, Claypole exhibited severe mental \n16  instability, believing that others were speaking to him telepathically through his \n17  thoughts. Mr. Klopfenstein assumed that the Jail had responded appropriately to his \n18  request to place Claypole on suicide watch. \n19  69.  However, the medical records from County of Monterey reflect that it \n20  was not until 2:35 p.m. on May 3, two days after Klopfenstein first requested \n21  suicide watch, that Defendants finally placed Claypole on suicide watch and \n22  transferred Claypole to a safety cell where he was supposed to be observed by Jail \n23  staff.   \n24  70.  Fewer than twenty-four hours later, at approximately 6:30 a.m. on May \n25  4, Defendants inexplicably released Claypole from suicide watch without any \n26  further suicide risk precautions. \n27  71.  At approximately 1 p.m. on May 4, 2013, Silvia Guersenzvaig arrived \n28  at Monterey County Jail to visit her son and to bring him his psychotropic \n   \n-17- \n  COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES\n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-PSG   Document1   Filed06/12/14   Page20 of 30\n \n1  medications, per his request.  However, Jail staff refused to allow her to see her son, \n2  telling her that Claypole had been moved to a different housing unit and visitation \n3  hours for that unit had not begun. Guersenzvaig gave Claypoleโs medications to a \n4  Jail nurse summoned by the on-duty officer. Denied the ability to visit her son, \n5  Guersenzvaig said to the nurse, โPlease tell Josh I love him regardless of what \n6  happened.โ  \n7  72.  On information and belief, Jail staff did not provide the medications \n8  brought by Silvia Guersenzvaig to Joshua Claypole.   \n9  73.  At a โwelfare checkโ conducted at approximately 2:30 p.m. on May 4, \n10  2013, Monterey County Deputy Sheriff Raymond Gordano found Joshua Claypole \n11  hanging from a cloth noose made of torn bed sheets inside his cell.  \n12  74.  According to the declaration of Dr. Pablo Stewart, an expert whose \n13  declaration was filed by plaintiffs in Hernandez v. County of Monterey, Jail staff \n14  failed to appropriately and timely respond to Claypoleโs suicide. Rather than \n15  immediately open the cell to cut down the ligature, Gordano requested back up by \n16  custody and medical staff. (See Exhibit 4 at ยถ 96.) Staff did not open Claypoleโs cell \n17  and begin to assist him until other staff arrived on the scene. (Id.) Jail personnel \n18  eventually cut the ligature using a knife, with some difficulty. (Id.) \n19  75.  At the time of his suicide, Claypole was housed in A Pod, an \n20  administrative segregation housing unit. The cell included a set of sturdy metal \n21  braces on the wall, which are suicide hazards in cells used for inmates in mental \n22  health crisis. Claypole tied the sheet he used to hang himself to these metal braces. \n23  76.  Jail records reflect the failure of jail staff to follow their own policies \n24  and procedures during and after suicide watch.  During the period when Claypole \n25  was placed in suicide watch, Jail personnel did not perform the required checks \n26  twice every 30 minutes, instead checking on him only once in some one-hour \n27  periods.  After removing him from suicide watch, Jail personnel did not check on \n28  Claypole hourly, as required by Jail policies. County of Montereyโs Hourly Safety \n   \n-18- \n  COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES\n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-PSG   Document1   Filed06/12/14   Page21 of 30\n \n1  Check log indicates that at the time staff discovered him hanging, staff had not \n2  performed a safety check for Claypole in over 6 hours.   \n3  77.  According to jail policies and procedures, as recounted by Dr. \n4  Hayward, no mental health personnel are on site at the Jail on weekends. \n5  Nevertheless, County of Monterey removed Claypole from suicide watch on \n6  Saturday when, upon information or belief, no mental health care staff were on site \n7  at the Jail.  Once Claypole was removed from suicide watch and placed back in \n8  general population, there were no mental health staff at the jail to monitor his \n9  condition, and custody staff failed to perform the required hourly safety checks.   \n10  78.  Defendantโs failure to appropriately staff its jail facility and monitor \n11  Claypole despite known and foreseeable suicide risks resulted in Claypole hanging \n12  himself just a few hours after his removal from suicide watch. \n13  79.  After staff discovered him hanging, Joshua Claypole was transferred to \n14  the care of emergency room personnel at Natividad Medical Center, then \n15  transported to the Trauma Center at San Jose Regional Medical Center via \n16  helicopter.  \n17  80.  Shortly after finding his body, Jail deputies found a handwritten \n18  suicide letter written by Claypole in his cell. Addressing his mother, Claypole \n19  wrote: โI love you mama. Iโm sorry for all the pain I have brought you mama. I love \n20  you very much. Maybe I will see you again. Love, Joshua.โ \n21  81.  On May 9, 2013, Joshua Claypole was declared dead. A subsequent \n22  County of Monterey postmortem examination conducted on May 13, 2013, \n23  concluded that he died from asphyxia due to hanging. \n24  /// \n25  /// \n26  /// \n27   \n28 \n   \n-19- \n  COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES\n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-PSG   Document1   Filed06/12/14   Page22 of 30\n \n1  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n2  First Claim for Relief \n3  Deliberate Indifference to Serious Medical and Mental Health Needs in \n4  Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United \n5  States (Survival Action โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n6  (Against Defendants County of San Mateo, Greg Munks, County of Monterey, \n7  Scott Miller, E.

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through \n10  81 as though fully set forth herein.  \n11  83.  Defendants have inadequate policies, procedures, and practices for \n12  identifying inmates in need of medical and mental health treatment and providing \n13  appropriate medical and mental health treatment. Defendants also fail to \n14  appropriately train and supervise staff regarding the provision of treatment to \n15  inmates with medical and mental health issues.  \n16  84.  Defendants have consistently failed to meet their constitutional \n17  obligation to provide adequate mental health care to prisoners in their jails.  The \n18  mental health care provided by Defendants to prisoners in their jails is woefully \n19  inadequate and falls far short of all of the minimum elements of a constitutional \n20  mental health care system.  Defendantsโ failure to correct their policies, procedures, \n21  and practices, despite notice of significant and dangerous problems, evidences \n22  deliberate indifference in the provision of mental health treatment. \n23  85.  Defendants knew or should have known that there was a strong \n24  likelihood that Joshua Claypole posed a threat to himself or others. \n25  86.  Defendants failed to provide necessary medical and mental health \n26  evaluation and treatment to Joshua Claypole while he was held at the Maguire \n27  Correctional Facility and Monterey County Jail, despite his history of serious \n28  mental illness, obvious symptoms of mental health crisis, and information that he \n   \n-20- \n  COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES\n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-PSG   Document1   Filed06/12/14   Page23 of 30\n \n1  was under the influence of narcotics.   \n2  87.  Defendantsโ acts and/or omissions as alleged herein, including but not \n3  limited to their failure to provide Joshua Claypole with appropriate medical or \n4  psychiatric care and to identify suicide risk, along with the acts and/or omissions of \n5  the Defendants in failing to train, supervise and/or promulgate appropriate policies \n6  and procedures in order to identify suicide risk and provide treatment, constituted \n7  deliberate indifference to Joshua Claypoleโs serious medical needs, health and \n8  safety. \n9  88.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ conduct, Joshua \n10  Claypole experienced physical pain, severe emotional distress, and mental anguish \n11  over a period of five days, as well as loss of his life and other damages alleged \n12  herein. \n13  89.  The aforementioned acts of Defendants were willful, wanton, \n14  malicious, and oppressive, thereby justifying an award to Plaintiff of exemplary and \n15  punitive damages to punish the wrongful conduct alleged herein and to deter such \n16  conduct in the future.   \n17  Second Claim for Relief \n18  Failure to Protect from Harm in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to \n19  the Constitution of the United States (Survival Action โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n20  (Against Defendants County of San Mateo, Greg Munks, County of Monterey, \n21  Scott Miller, E.

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through \n24  89 as though fully set forth herein. \n25  91.  Each Defendant could have taken action to prevent unnecessary harm \n26  to Joshua Claypole, but refused or failed to do so.  \n27  92.  Defendants failed to have minimally necessary policies and procedures \n28  concerning the adequate identification and housing of Claypole, whom they knew \n   \n-21- \n  COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES\n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-PSG   Document1   Filed06/12/14   Page24 of 30\n \n1  or should have known to be at risk of self-harm.  \n2  93.  City of Monterey, Philip Penko, and Brent Hall failed to take \n3  necessary precautions to ensure that Claypole would not harm himself or others \n4  after he communicated clearly suicidal thoughts to Monterey Police Department \n5  officers. They also failed to create minimally necessary policies and procedures for \n6  ensuring that other entities and municipalities were informed of suicide risks among \n7  Monterey Police Department arrestees who are transferred from their custody. \n8  Lastly, they failed to adequately train and supervise officers to protect arrestees \n9  from harm. \n10  94.  County Defendants failed to implement minimally sufficient policies \n11  and procedures to protect inmates from harm. County Defendants failed to \n12  appropriately train and supervise staff regarding identification and handling of \n13  detainees at risk of harm. With respect to Joshua Claypole, County Defendants \n14  failed to follow even their own suicide prevention procedures to identify, house, \n15  and monitor detainees at risk of self-harm.  \n16  95.  Defendantsโ acts and/or omissions as alleged herein, including but not \n17  limited to their failure to take appropriate measures to protect Joshua Claypole from \n18  harm, along with the acts and/or omissions of the Defendants in failing to train, \n19  supervise and/or promulgate appropriate policies and procedures in order to protect \n20  Joshua Claypole from harm, constituted deliberate indifference to Joshua \n21  Claypoleโs serious medical needs, health, and safety. \n22  96.

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through \n10  97 as though fully set forth herein. \n11  99.  The aforementioned acts and/or omissions of Defendants in being \n12  deliberatively indifferent to Joshua Claypoleโs serious medical needs, health and \n13  safety, violating Joshua Claypoleโs constitutional rights, and their failure to train, \n14  supervise, and/or take other appropriate measures to prevent the acts and/or \n15  omissions that caused the untimely and wrongful death of Joshua Claypole \n16  deprived Plaintiff Guersenzvaig of her liberty interest in the parent-child \n17  relationship in violation of her substantive due process rights as defined by the First \n18  and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \n19  100.  As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned acts and/or \n20  omissions of Defendants, Plaintiffs suffered injuries and damages as alleged herein. \n21  101.  The aforementioned acts and/or omissions of the individually named \n22  Defendants were willful, wanton, malicious, and oppressive, thereby justifying an \n23  award of exemplary and punitive damages to punish the wrongful conduct alleged \n24  herein and to deter such conduct in the future. \n25  /// \n26  /// \n27  /// \n28   \n   \n-23- \n  COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES\n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-PSG   Document1   Filed06/12/14   Page26 of 30\n \n1  Fourth Claim for Relief \n2  Professional Negligence / Medical Malpractice (Survival Actions โ California \n3  State Law) \n4  (Against Defendants County of Monterey, Scott Miller, E.

Defendants failed to comply with professional standards in the \n10  treatment of Joshua Claypoleโs serious mental illness by failing to appropriately \n11  assess and evaluate his mental health and suicide risk, failing to take appropriate \n12  and timely suicide prevention measures, prematurely removing Claypole from \n13  suicide watch and returning him to an unsafe cell, failing to provide appropriate \n14  mental health treatment, and failing to prescribe or provide appropriate and \n15  necessary psychiatric medications and ensure compliance with those medications. \n16  104.  Defendants also failed to appropriately supervise, review, and ensure \n17  the competence of medical staffโs and custody staffโs provision of treatment to \n18  Claypole, and failed to enact appropriate standards and procedures that would have \n19  prevented such harm to him.  \n20  105.

Defendants owed Joshua Claypole a duty of care to provide him \n10  immediate medical and mental health care. \n11  110.  The conduct of Defendants alleged herein, including but not limited to \n12  the facts that Defendants knew or had reason to know that Joshua Claypole was in \n13  need of immediate medical and mental health care and that Defendants failed to \n14  take reasonable action to summon or provide that care, resulting in Joshua \n15  Claypoleโs death as alleged herein, violated California state law, including Cal. \n16  Govt.

Defendants also failed to timely and appropriately respond to Joshua \n18  Claypoleโs expressions of suicidal ideation, in which he requested that he be killed \n19  and stated his desire to kill himself on numerous occasions before hanging himself \n20  in his cell. \n21  112.  The alleged conduct of Defendants was committed within the course \n22  and scope of their employment. \n23  113.

SUMMARY JUDGMENT; AND \n  DENYING PLAINTIFFSโ MOTION FOR \n9  COUNTY OF SAN MATEO, et al.,  LEAVE TO SUBSTITUTE DETECTIVE \nKRUSE AS A DOE DEFENDANT \n10  Defendants. \n[Re:  ECF 97, 108] \n11   \n \n \n12     \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13    This action arises from the suicide of twenty-year old Joshua Claypole (โClaypoleโ) while \nCfi\n tclaC 14  he was detained in a Monterey County Jail cell.  Plaintiffs are the Estate of Joshua Claypole, by \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  and through Silvia Guersenzvaig (Claypoleโs mother) as Administrator, and Silvia Guersenzvaig \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  individually (โPlaintiffsโ).  Plaintiffs have sued a number of public employees and agencies that \nS de nre 17  had contact with Claypole in the days leading up to his death.  Before the Court are two motions:  \nth\nintr\nUoN 18  (1) a motion for summary judgment, brought by Defendants City of Monterey (โCityโ) and City of \n19  Monterey Police Officer Brent Hall (โHallโ),1 and (2) a motion for leave to substitute City of \n20  Monterey Detective Bryan Kruse (โKruseโ) as a Doe defendant, brought by Plaintiffs.  The Court \n21  has considered the partiesโ briefing, the relevant legal authorities, and the oral argument that was \n22  presented at the hearing on November 12, 2015.  For the reasons discussed below, Defendant \n23  Hallโs motion for summary judgment is GRANTED, Defendant Cityโs motion for summary \n24  judgment is DENIED, and Plaintiffsโ motion for leave to substitute Kruse as a Doe defendant is \n25  DENIED.   \n26 \n                                                 \n1 City of Monterey Police Chief Philip Penko (โPenkoโ), also named as a defendant in this action \n27 \nin his official capacity, has not moved for summary judgment.  However, the parties have \nstipulated that the Courtโs ruling with respect to the City shall bind and have the same force and \n28 \neffect as to Defendant Penko.  See Stipulation and Order, ECF 145. \n\n \n1    I.  BACKGROUND2 \n2    Prior to the events giving rise to this action, Claypole had been under the care of various \n3  psychiatrists and psychologists.  Guersenzvaig Dep. 46:23-47:6, ECF 105-4.  On the afternoon of \n4  April 28, 2013, Claypole left his home in Big Sur, where he lived with his mother.  Id. 36:8-24.  \n5  On April 30, 2013, he was arrested in Redwood City, California, on suspicion of driving under the \n6  influence.  Drug Influence Evaluation, Exh. 85 to Tajsar Decl, ECF 105-3.  Claypoleโs vehicle was \n7  towed and he was taken to the San Mateo County Jail.  Police Report (Bowers), Exh. 45 to Tajsar \n8  Decl., ECF 105-3.  The arresting officer characterized Claypole as confused, with a โblank spacey \n9  stare,โ stated that Claypole did not appear to understand what was happening, and indicated that \n10  Claypole responded incoherently to questions.  Id.    \n11    It is not clear when Claypole was released from the San Mateo County Jail, but on May 1, \n12  2013, he appeared at the Community Hospital of Monterey Peninsula (โCHOMPโ), where he \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  previously had received treatment.  Martin Dep. 70:7-20, ECF 105-4; Guersenzvaig Dep. 49:17-\nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  50:3, ECF 105-4.  He told the receptionist that he was being chased by someone with a knife.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Martin Dep. 70:12-20, ECF 105-4.  CHOMP employees asked Claypole to leave, which he did.  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Moises Dep. 71:2-72:23, ECF 105-4.  Claypole then went to a nearby Wells Fargo Bank, \nS d nr\nee 17  withdrew money, and asked a bank employee to call him a taxi.  Police Report (Zook), Exh. 12 to \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Tajsar Decl., ECF 105-2.  The bank employee later described Claypole as โout of itโ and โin and \n19  out of consciousness.โ  Id.  Claypole took the taxi to a local rental car company and there he \n20  fatally stabbed the taxi driver.  Police Report (Kruse), Exh. 11 to Tajsar Decl., ECF 105-2.  \n21    Shortly thereafter, Seaside Police Department officers stopped Claypole, who was driving \n22  a stolen pickup truck, and detained him pending arrival of City police officers.  Police Report \n23  (Hall), Exh. 9 to Tajsar Decl., ECF 105-2.  City of Monterey Police Officer Hall arrived at the \n24  scene and placed Claypole in the rear of his patrol vehicle.  Id.  Hall transported Claypole to the \n25  City of Monterey Jail for booking.  Id.  The booking process included a screening and assessment \n26  of Claypole conducted by a Police Service Technician (โPSTโ) named Philip Bitter (โBitterโ).  Id.; \n27 \n                                                 \n28 \n2 The background facts contained in this section are undisputed. \n2 \n\n \n1  Booking Information, Exh. 15 to Tajsar Decl., ECF 105-2.  Bitter documented the screening on \n2  the Cityโs booking form, which contains a โmedical screeningโ section listing a series of 34 \n3  checkboxes describing various medical issues.  Booking Information, Exh. 15 to Tajsar Decl., \n4  ECF 105-2.   \n5    While in Hallโs patrol car, during booking, and after booking while waiting to be \n6  interviewed by a detective, Claypole made a number of spontaneous utterances, including the \n7  following:  โCan you ask for the injection?โ; โI had to do it.โ; โHe told me to do it.  He just \n8  wouldnโt die.โ; โShould I go?โ; and โI should just take the injection.โ  Hall Dep. 62:16-24, 73:21-\n9  25, ECF 105-4.  Claypole also asked Hall whether his mother would get his remains, said that he \n10  wanted to die by lethal injection, and said that he wanted to have his body cremated.  Id. 74:8-13. \n11    Claypole was interviewed by City of Monterey Detective Kruse and Sergeant William \n12  Clark.  Police Report (Kruse), Exh. 11 to Tajsar Decl., ECF 105-2; Video Footage of Interview, \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Exh. 81 to Tajsar Decl. (manually filed).  Claypoleโs Miranda rights were read to him several \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  times because he kept indicating that he did not understand them.  Police Report (Kruse), Exh. 11 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  to Tajsar Decl., ECF 105-2.  Once the interview began, Claypole said that he was trying to decide \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  if he was going to take lethal injection.  Kruse Dep. 181:14-25, ECF 105-4.  Claypole also said he \nS d nr\nee 17  had been hallucinating.  Id. 183:1-9.  Claypole stated that he took medication, including \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  prescriptions for anxiety, and that he had been up for forty-eight hours.  Id. 185:7-11, 191:4-7.   \n19  Kruse observed that some of Claypoleโs responses to questions were completely off topic.  Id. \n20  194:2-12.  For example, when Kruse asked Claypole whether he had used controlled substances \n21  recently, he responded, โYouโre telling me that they found the dead bodies?โ  Id.  Kruse elected \n22  not to complete the interview because of the difficulty getting straight answers out of Claypole, \n23  which Kruse thought might be due to the influence of a controlled substance.  Id. 132:3-14.  \n24    Kruse and City of Monterey Officer Jeremiah Ruttschow (โRuttschowโ) transported \n25  Claypole to CHOMP for a blood draw.  Kruse Dep. 133:16-134:6, ECF 105-4.  While at CHOMP, \n26  Claypole became upset and wanted to see a manager.  Id. 137:5-24.  He refused to have blood \n27  drawn, stating that the officers were trying to kill him.  Id. 138:1-23.  He also resisted efforts to get \n28  him back to the squad car.  Id. 138:24-139:8.  Kruse and Ruttschow physically removed Claypole \n3 \n\n \n1  from CHOMP, placed him in the squad car, and transported him back to the City jail.  Id. 139:5- 8; \n2  Ruttschow Dep. 168:9-18, ECF 105-4.  \n3    At approximately 9:00 p.m. that evening, Ruttschow transported Claypole to Monterey \n4  County Jail.  Ruttschow Dep. 169:10-23, ECF 105-4.  When an arresting agency transfers a \n5  suspect to the Monterey County Jail, the arresting agency completes and provides a โPre-Booking \n6  Sheetโ3 to the County.  Jackson Dep. 70:24-72:21, ECF 105-4.  The Pre-Booking Sheet for \n7  Claypole was completed by PST Bitter, who signed the sheet โBitter for Kruse.โ  Pre-Booking \n8  Sheet, Exh. 6 to Tajsar Decl., ECF 105-3.  Out of the listed descriptors for demeanor, Bitter \n9  circled โcalm,โ and out of the listed descriptors for speech, Bitter circled โslow.โ  Id.  The Pre-\n10  Booking Sheet did not describe any of Claypoleโs aberrant behavior and did not indicate that he \n11  might be suffering from a mental health issue.  Id.   \n12    Claypole was screened when he arrived at the Monterey County Jail.  Intake Health \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Screening, Exh. 32 to Tajsar Decl., ECF 105-3.  The intake health screening form completed that \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  night has the โnoโ box checked for the questions:  โDoes behavior suggest a danger to self or \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  others?โ and โDoes inmate appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol?โ  Id.  The box on \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  the intake health screening form for โpsychiatric problemsโ is not checked.  Id.  \nS d nr\nee 17    After Claypole was booked into the Monterey County Jail, he met with his defense \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  attorney, John Klopfenstein (โKlopfensteinโ).  Bass Dep. 188:2-9, Defs.โ Exh. N, ECF 98-10; \n19  McGregor Memo., Defs.โ Exh. Q, ECF 98-11.  Following that meeting, Klopfenstein told jail \n20  personnel that Claypole had stated that he wanted to kill himself.  McGregor Memo., Defs.โ Exh. \n21  Q, ECF 98-11.  Claypole was placed in a safety cell on suicide watch that night.  Kaye Dep. 83:7-\n22  10, 126:10-127:25, Defs.โ Exh. O, ECF 98-10.  He was taken off suicide watch the following \n23  morning, on May 2, 2013.  Id. 98:18-21, 137:12-138:21.  Claypole was placed on suicide watch a \n24  second time on May 3, 2013.

U, ECF 98-11. \n2    Plaintiffsโ operative first amended complaint (โFACโ) asserts the following claims:  (1) a ยง \n3  19834 claim for deliberate indifference to serious medical and mental health needs in violation of \n4  the Fourteenth Amendment ; (2) a ยง 1983 claim for failure to protect from harm in violation of the \n5  Fourteenth Amendment; (3) a ยง 1983 claim for deprivation of substantive due process in violation \n6  of the First and Fourteenth Amendments (causing loss of parent/child relationship); (4) a \n7  professional negligence/medical malpractice claim under California law; (5) failure to furnish \n8  medical care under California law; (6) negligent supervision, training, hiring, and retention under \n9  California law; and (7) wrongful death under California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 377.60.   \n10    The City and Officer Hall are defendants to the second claim for failure to protect from \n11  harm in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and the third claim for deprivation of substantive \n12  due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.  They seek summary judgment as to both claims.  \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  In their opposition to the City Defendantsโ motion for summary judgment, Plaintiffs indicate that \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  they intend to dismiss Hall based upon information gained in discovery.  Plaintiffs instead wish to \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  seek individual liability against City of Monterey Detective Kruse, and they have filed a motion \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  seeking leave to substitute Kruse as a Doe defendant.  That motion is opposed by the City \nS d nr\nee 17  Defendants.   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18    II.  CITY DEFENDANTSโ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n19    A.  Legal Standard \n20    โA party is entitled to summary judgment if the โmovant shows that there is no genuine \n21  dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.โโ  City of \n22  Pomona v. SQM North America Corp., 750 F.3d 1036, 1049 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting Fed. R.

At the hearing, Plaintiffsโ counsel clarified that Plaintiffsโ \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Fourteenth Amendment claim against the City is based upon their contention that the City lacks \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  minimally necessary policies and procedures for identifying a detaineeโs mental health issues and \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  responding to those issues appropriately by either transferring the detainee to a mental health \nS d nr\nee 17  facility or transmitting information regarding the detaineeโs mental health to the next custodian. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18    Applying the legal standard set forth above, the City may be liable on Claim 2 if (1) a City \n19  employee violated Claypoleโs rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, (2) the City has customs or \n20  policies that amount to deliberate indifference, and (3) those customs or policies were the moving \n21  force behind the City employeeโs violation of Claypoleโs Fourteenth Amendment rights. \n22        a.

Thus to make out a claim of deliberate indifference, a plaintiff must establish \n22  โserious medical need, indifference to that need, and harm caused by that indifference.โ  Id.   \n23    Before turning the partiesโ evidence on these three elements, the Court briefly addresses \n24  the Cityโs argument that it cannot be liable under a โspecial relationshipโ theory because the \n25  special relationship created by the Cityโs custody of Claypole terminated when the City transferred \n26  custody of Claypole to Monterey County.  See Defs.โ Br. at 6-7, ECF 97.  The City acknowledges \n27  that a special relationship existed during the period in which the City had custody of Claypole.  \n28  See DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty. Depโt of Social Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 198 (1989) (recognizing \n8 \n\n \n1  that although the Due Process clause generally does not confer an affirmative right to \n2  governmental aid, โthe Eighth Amendmentโs prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, \n3  made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendmentโs Due Process Clause, requires \n4  the State to provide adequate medical care to incarcerated prisonersโ) (internal citation omitted).  \n5  The City argues, however, that City officersโ alleged knowledge that Claypole was a suicide risk \n6  did not create a continuing relationship after the City transferred custody to Monterey County.  \n7  Plaintiffs do not assert the existence of a continuing relationship following transfer of Claypoleโs \n8  custody.  See Pls.โ Opp. at 17-18, ECF 105.  Plaintiffsโ theory of liability is that the City and its \n9  officers violated Claypoleโs Fourteenth Amendment rights by their deliberate indifference to his \n10  serious medical need while he was in the Cityโs custody.  That theory properly is evaluated under \n11  the standards set forth in Conn, Simmons, and Gibson, and discussed in detail below.    \n12          i.  Serious Medical Need \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13    A detainee has โa serious medical need if the failure to treat the condition could result in \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  further significant injury or the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.โ  Conn, 591 F.3d at \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  1095 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  โA heightened suicide risk or an attempted \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  suicide is a serious medical need.โ  Id.; see also Simmons, 609 F.3d at 1018 (โ[W]e have \nS d nr\nee 17  previously recognized that a heightened suicide risk can present a serious medical need.โ).  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18    The City argues that Claypole did not have a serious medical need while he was in the \n19  Cityโs custody.  See Defs.โ Reply at 4-6, ECF 107.  However, the Court has no difficulty \n20  concluding that a reasonable jury could find to the contrary.  The evidence demonstrates that a \n21  reasonable inference could be drawn by the jury that Claypole was in the midst of a mental health \n22  crisis when he entered the Cityโs custody.  Claypole had a history of mental illness.  See \n23  Guersenzvaig Dep. 46:23-47:6, ECF 105-4 (stating that Claypole had been under the care of \n24  various psychiatrists and psychologists).  On April 28, 2013, he left his home in Big Sur for what \n25  would become a period of several days.  See id. 36:8-24.  When he was arrested two days later on \n26  suspicion of driving under the influence, he acted confused with a โblank spacey stare,โ did not \n27  appear to understand what was happening, and responded incoherently to questions.  Police Report \n28  (Bowers), Exh. 45 to Tajsar Decl., ECF 105-3.  On May 1, 2013, the date Claypole entered the \n9 \n\n \n1  Cityโs custody, he exhibited bizarre behavior at CHOMP, see Martin Dep. 70:7-20, and at Wells \n2  Fargo, see Police Report (Zook), Exh. 12 to Tajsar Decl., ECF 105-2.  Shortly thereafter, Claypole \n3  killed a man for reasons that remain unexplained.  Police Report (Kruse), Exh. 11 to Tajsar Decl., \n4  ECF 105-2.   \n5    While in the Cityโs custody, Claypole made numerous statements to Officer Hall about \n6  dying by lethal injection, asking for lethal injection, and his mother getting his remains.  Hall Dep. \n7  62:16-24, 73:21-25, 74:8-13, ECF 105-4.  Dr. W. Taylor Fithian, who provided mental health \n8  treatment to detainees at the Monterey County jail, testified that a patientโs repeated statements of \n9  a desire to die and concern about what would happen to his remains are indicators of potential \n10  suicide risk.  Fithian Dep. 128:21-129:9, ECF 105-4.    \n11    Claypole exhibited other strange behavior as well.  After initially agreeing to a blood draw \n12  and being transported to a hospital for that purpose, Claypole became convinced that the blood \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  draw actually was a lethal injection and he became so agitated that the blood draw could not be \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  accomplished.  Kruse Dep. 133:16-134:6, 137:5-139:8, ECF 105-4; Ruttschow Dep. 168:9-18, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  ECF 105-4.  The video of Claypoleโs interview by Detective Kruse and Sergeant Clark is \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  disturbing.  See Video Footage, Exh. 81 to Tajsar Decl. (manually filed).  At times during the \nS d nr\nee 17  interview Claypole did not seem to understand what was happening.  Id.  His responses to some \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  questions were totally unrelated to what had been asked.  Id.  At various points during the \n19  interview Claypole stated that he had been awake for forty-eight hours, that he was hallucinating, \n20  and that he took prescription medications.  Id.   \n21    On the night of May 1, 2013, shortly after he had been transferred to the custody of \n22  Monterey County, Claypole told his lawyer that he wanted to kill himself.  McGregor Memo., \n23  Defs.โ Exh. Q, ECF 98-11.  Claypole in fact hanged himself a few days later, on May 4, 2013.  \n24  Inmate Injury Report, Defs.โ Exh. U, ECF 98-11.  \n25    Based upon this record, a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that Claypole was in the \n26  midst of a mental health crisis, and was a suicide risk, while he was in the Cityโs custody on May \n27  1, 2013.  The City attempts to distinguish this case factually from others in which a serious \n28  medical need was found, arguing for example that Claypole did not attempt to kill himself while in \n10 \n\n \n1  custody as did the decedent in Conn and did not tell officers he was suicidal as did the decedent in \n2  Clouthier.  See Conn, 591 F.3d at 1096 (decedent wrapped seatbelt around her neck in apparent \n3  attempt to choke herself); Clouthier v. Cnty. of Contra Costa, 591 F.3d 1232, 1237 (9th Cir. 2010) \n4  (decedent informed county mental health specialist that he was suicidal and had made prior suicide \n5  attempts).   \n6    In Clouthier, it was undisputed that the decedent was at โsubstantial risk of serious harm.โ  \n7  Clouthier, 591 F.3d at 1244.  The question was whether the record contained sufficient evidence \n8  from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the officers knew of and were deliberately \n9  indifferent to that risk of harm.  Id.  Accordingly, Clouthier does not advance the Cityโs argument \n10  that Claypole did not have a serious medical need.  In Conn, the question of whether the decedent \n11  had a serious medical need was disputed, and the court concluded that a reasonable jury could find \n12  such a need โin light of all the circumstances.โ  Conn, 591 F.3d at 1096.  There is no indication in \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  the Conn decision that an actual suicidal attempt is required to establish a serious medical need.  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Accordingly, because a reasonable jury evaluating all of the circumstances in this case could find \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  for Plaintiffs on this point, a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether Claypole had a \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  serious medical need while he was in the Cityโs custody.  \nS d nr\nee 17          ii.  Indifference to Serious Medical Need  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18    To demonstrate that the Cityโs officers were indifferent to Claypoleโs serious medical \n19  need, Plaintiffs โmust show that the officers were (a) subjectively aware of the serious medical \n20  need and (b) failed to adequately respond.โ  Conn, 591 F.3d at 1096 (citing Farmer v. Brennan, \n21  511 U.S. 825, 838 (1994)).   \n22            a.  Subjectively Aware \n23    In order to be subjectively aware of a serious medical need, an official โmust both be \n24  aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm \n25  exists, and he must also draw the inference.โ  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837 (emphasis added).  The \n26  Court notes that the moving papers argue only the first part of this test, that Claypoleโs conduct \n27  did not give rise to an inference that he was a suicide risk.  The moving papers do not argue that \n28  the officers failed to draw the requisite inference.  Only in the reply brief does the City argue that \n11 \n\n \n1  Hall, Kruse, and Ruttschow โ the officers who had the most contact with Claypole โ did not \n2  believe Claypole to be a suicide risk.  The reply brief cites the officersโ deposition testimony as to \n3  their subjective beliefs.  See Hall Dep. 72:19-75:3, 86:4-8, Defs.โ Exh. W, ECF 107-4 (Hall did \n4  not consider Claypoleโs conduct indicative of suicidal intent or desire but rather indicative of \n5  knowledge that he had been caught and would be punished); Kruse Dep. 131:10-132:2, 139:25-\n6  140:4, 182:2-7, Defs.โ Exh. V, ECF 107-4 (Kruse did not consider Claypole to be a danger to \n7  himself); Ruttschow Dep. 234:24-235:5, Defs.โ Exh. X, ECF 107-4 (Ruttschow did not believe \n8  Claypole was at risk for suicide).  Ordinarily, โwhere new evidence is presented in a reply to a \n9  motion for summary judgment, the district court should not consider the new evidence without \n10  giving the non-movant an opportunity to respond.โ  Provenz v. Miller, 102 F.3d 1478, 1483 (9th \n11  Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted).  However, Plaintiffs have not \n12  objected to or otherwise challenged the Cityโs introduction of the subject deposition testimony.  \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Their failure to do so waives any challenge to the admissibility of that evidence.  See Getz v. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Boeing Co., 654 F.3d 852, 868 (9th Cir. 2011). \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15    With respect to the Cityโs argument that Claypoleโs behavior did not give rise to an \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  inference that he was at risk for suicide, the Court concludes that a reasonable jury could find to \nS d nr\nee 17  the contrary.  As discussed above, during the Cityโs custody of him, Claypole was fixated on the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  idea of dying by lethal injection and what would happen to his remains.  See Hall Dep. 62:16-24, \n19  73:21-25, 74:8-13, ECF 105-4.  Claypole acted strangely during his custodial interview and when \n20  he was driven to the hospital for a blood draw.  See Video Footage, Exh. 81 to Tajsar Decl. \n21  (manually filed); Kruse Dep. 133:16-134:6, 137:5-139:8, ECF 105-4; Ruttschow Dep. 168:9-18, \n22  ECF 105-4.  That conduct certainly could be construed as indicative of a mental health crisis \n23  involving suicidal ideation.   \n24    The City argues that Claypoleโs conduct did not indicate suicidal ideation but rather \n25  suggested that โClaypole was resigned to the notion that the police and the court controlled his \n26  fate, not himself.โ  Defs.โ Br. at 9, ECF 97.  The City also argues that some of Claypoleโs conduct \n27  โ for example, refusing a blood draw because he feared it would kill him โ showed that he did not \n28  want to die.  Id.  The Court agrees that those inferences could have been drawn from the facts \n12 \n\n \n1  available to the officers.  However, an inference that Claypole was in the midst of a mental health \n2  crisis was equally plausible given Claypoleโs fixation on his own death and other behavior.   \n3    With respect to the Cityโs argument that none of the officers actually drew the inference \n4  that Claypole was at risk of harming himself, the Ninth Circuit has held in a similar case that \n5  summary judgment on a deliberate indifference claim cannot be supported โsimply on the basis of \n6  the defendantsโ assertions as to their own state of mind.โ  Conn, 591 F.3d at 1097.  In Conn, two \n7  police officers picked up a woman, Brenda Clustka, who was passed out drunk on the sidewalk.  \n8  Id. at 1092.  While transporting Clustka to the county jail on a civil protective custody hold, the \n9  officers witnessed her wrap a seatbelt around her neck in an apparent attempt to choke herself.  Id.  \n10  When the officers pulled over, unwrapped the seatbelt, and handcuffed her, Clustka screamed that \n11  the officers should kill her and that she would kill herself.  Id.  The officers did not report the \n12  incident to jail personnel when they handed off custody.  Clustka was held for several hours and \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  then released.  Id. at 1093.  Clustka was arrested by other officers the following day.  Because she \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  had been placed on suicide watch during a detention the previous month, Clustka was placed in \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the mental health unit in a red jumper to alert staff that she was a high risk detainee.  Id.  She was \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  not placed on suicide watch.  Id.  She hanged herself with her bedsheet the following day.  Id.  \nS d nr\nee 17  Clustkaโs children sued the police officers who witnessed the seatbelt incident for deliberate \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  indifference to Clustkaโs serious medical need โ her suicide risk โ which they alleged caused her \n19  death.  Id. at 1094.   \n20    The Ninth Circuit reversed the district courtโs grant of summary judgment for the officers, \n21  holding that the officersโ testimony that they did not subjectively believe Clustka to be a suicide \n22  risk was insufficient to establish their entitlement to judgment.  The court explained that โ[p]roof \n23  of โsubjective awarenessโ is not limited to the purported recollections of the individuals involved.โ  \n24  Conn, 591 F.3d at 1097.  Instead, the court stated, โ[w]hether [an] official had the requisite \n25  knowledge of a substantial risk is a question of fact subject to demonstration in the usual ways, \n26  including inference from circumstantial evidence.โ  Id. (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842).  The \n27  court determined that a reasonable jury could conclude from the record evidence โthat Clustkaโs \n28  medical need was so obvious that [the officers] must have been subjectively aware of it, despite \n13 \n\n \n1  their later denial of that awareness.โ  Id.  The court noted that โquestions involving a personโs state \n2  of mind are generally factual issues inappropriate for resolution by summary judgment.โ  Id. at \n3  1098 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).   \n4    In the present case, a reasonable jury likewise could conclude that Claypoleโs medical need \n5  was so obvious that Hall, Kruse, and Ruttschow must have been subjectively aware of it despite \n6  their later testimony to the contrary.  Particularly significant on this point is the evidence of \n7  Claypoleโs utterances to Hall regarding lethal injection and the fate of his remains, and the \n8  evidence of Claypoleโs behavior during his custodial interview with Kruse.  In the Courtโs view, \n9  the videotape of the custodial interview is so chilling that it alone could support a juryโs \n10  determination that Kruse at least must have known that Claypole was in the midst of a mental \n11  health crisis.5  Accordingly, a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether the Cityโs officers \n12  were subjectively aware of Claypoleโs serious medical need. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13            b.  Failure to Respond \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    In Conn, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the officersโ failure to take Clustka to a medical \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  facility or to report her behavior to the next custodian โ the county jail personnel โ constituted a \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  failure to respond.  Conn, 591 F.3d at 1098.  The court noted that the defendant officers had not \nS d nr\nee 17  argued that, if they were subjectively aware of Clustkaโs serious medical need, they nonetheless \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18 \n                                                 \n19 \n5 In addition to the evidence discussed above, Plaintiffs submit video footage taken from the on-\nboard dashboard camera in Officer Hallโs squad car.  See Video Footage, Exh. 115 to Tajsar Decl. \n20 \n(submitted manually).  The footage shows Claypole being placed in the back of the squad car and \nsitting there with his hands cuffed behind him while a conversation takes place off-camera.  In the \n21 \noff-camera conversation, one man is instructing another man to bag all of Claypoleโs clothing and \nto take photographs of Claypoleโs hands โbefore he washes off all that blood.โ  Id. 18:19-18:32.  \n22 \nThe man giving the instructions then tells the other man to โhang with him, make sure he doesnโt \nkill himself,โ and to โjust hang with him, make sure he doesnโt 5150 himself.โ  Id. 18:32-18:52.  \n23 \nPlaintiffs assert that the conversation was between another police officer and Hall and that it \nshows Hall was put on notice that Claypole might be suicidal.  The Cityโs objections the video \n24 \nfootage are OVERRULED.  The Cityโs argument that the video footage is unauthenticated is \nwithout merit, as the City itself produced the footage to Plaintiffs during discovery, representing \n25 \nthat it was true footage from Hallโs squad car dashboard camera.  The Cityโs argument that \nPlaintiffs have not established the identities of the men in the conversation goes to the weight of \n26 \nthe evidence rather than its admissibility.  The Cityโs hearsay objection is without merit as the \nevidence is not submitted for the truth of the matter โ that Claypole actually was suicidal โ but to \n27 \nshow that Hall had notice of that possibility.  See Fed. R. Evid. 801 (precluding statements offered \nto prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement).     \n28 \n \n14 \n\n \n1  responded appropriately.  The City likewise has not argued in the present case that its officersโ \n2  response was appropriate if they were subjectively aware of Claypoleโs serious medical need.  \n3  Like the officers in Conn, Hall, Kruse, and Ruttschow failed to take Claypole to a mental health \n4  facility or to report his behavior to his next custodian, the County.   \n5          iii.  Resulting Harm \n6    The City argues that even if Plaintiffs could establish the other elements of a deliberate \n7  indifference claim, the officersโ conduct could not have been the proximate cause of Claypoleโs \n8  death.  See Clouthier, 591 F.3d at 1245 n.3 (โto prevail on a ยง 1983 claim under a deliberate \n9  indifference theory, plaintiff must prove that the officialโs actions were both the actual and \n10  proximate cause of plaintiffโs injuriesโ) (citing White v. Roper, 901 F.2d 1501, 1505 (9th Cir. \n11  1990)).  Specifically, the City contends that the actions of Monterey County in twice placing \n12  Claypole on, and then removing him from, suicide watch constituted a superseding cause that \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  precludes any liability against the City.   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    In ยง 1983 actions, โ[t]raditional tort law defines intervening causes that break the chain of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  proximate causation.โ  Van Ort v. Estate of Stanewich, 92 F.3d 831, 837 (9th Cir. 1996) (citation \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  omitted).  A defendantโs conduct is not the proximate cause of the plaintiffโs injury โif another \nS d nr\nee 17  cause intervenes and supersedes his liability for the subsequent events.โ  White, 901 F.2d at 1506.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  โHowever, โforeseeable intervening causes . . . will not supersede the defendantโs responsibility.โ  \n19  Conn, 591 F.3d at 1101 (quoting White, 901 F.2d at 1506).  โIf โreasonable persons could differโ \n20  over the question of foreseeability, โsummary judgment is inappropriate and the question should \n21  be left to the jury.โโ  Id. (quoting White, 901 F.2d at 1506). \n22    A reasonable jury applying these standards to the facts of this case easily could find for the \n23  City on causation given the lapse of time between the Cityโs custody and Claypoleโs death and \n24  Monterey Countyโs actions in twice placing Claypole on and twice removing him from suicide \n25  watch.  However, Conn strongly suggests that it must be left to the jury to make that finding.  As \n26  in the present case, the officers in Conn interacted with Clustka several days before her suicide.  \n27  Clustka was medically evaluated three times after the choking incident and each time determined \n28  not to be at risk of suicide.  Conn, 591 F.3d at 1101.  The Conn court was not persuaded that those \n15 \n\n \n1  medical evaluations constituted a superseding cause, noting that โ[w]hen medical examiners have \n2  insufficient information about the patient they are diagnosing, they are likely to give an inaccurate \n3  diagnosis.โ  Id.  The court held that by failing to pass on relevant information, the officers \n4  foreseeably undermined Clustkaโs access to effective medical evaluations and adequate mental \n5  health care.  Id.  The court concluded that notwithstanding the later medical evaluations, a jury \n6  could conclude that the officersโ failure to take action following the seatbelt incident โwas a \n7  moving force and proximate cause of Clustkaโs suicide.โ  Id.   \n8    A jury similarly could conclude in the present case that the officersโ failure to pass on \n9  information regarding Claypoleโs behavior could have impaired the medical evaluations that \n10  foreseeably were performed by Monterey County.  Dr. Fithian, the doctor who was responsible for \n11  taking Claypole off suicide watch both times, testified that he was not aware that Claypole had \n12  asked City officers about lethal injection, asked City officers what would happen to his remains, or \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  told City officers that he had been hallucinating.  Fithian Dep. 127:14-128:12, ECF 105-4.  When \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  asked whether that information would have made a difference to his assessment of Claypoleโs risk \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  of suicide, Dr. Fithian stated that โ[e]very little bit of information is certainly โ can be important.โ  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Id. 128:13-17.  Dr. Fithian also testified that a patientโs repeated statements of a desire to die and \nS d nr\nee 17  concern about what would happen to his remains are indicators of risk for suicide.  Id. 12:1-9. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18    Thus while a jury ultimately may be persuaded at trial that Monterey Countyโs conduct \n19  was a superseding cause that precludes liability on the part of the City, the Court concludes that it \n20  must be left to the jury to make that determination.  Because a reasonable jury could conclude that \n21  the City officersโ observations regarding Claypoleโs behavior would have made a difference to the \n22  Countyโs evaluation of Claypoleโs suicide risk, there is a triable issue of material fact which \n23  precludes summary judgment on the issue of causation.   \n24        b.  Policy Amounting to Deliberate Indifference \n25    The Ninth Circuit has held that a lack of affirmative policies or procedures to guide \n26  employees can amount to deliberate indifference even when other general policies are in place.  \n27  See, e.g., Long, 442 F.3d at 1189; Gibson, 290 F.3d at 1195-96.  โ[W]hen the need to remedy the \n28  omission โis so obvious, and the inadequacy is so likely to result in the violation of constitutional \n16 \n\n \n1  rights, . . . the policymakers of the city can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent \n2  to the need.โโ  Gibson, 290 F.3d at 1195 (quoting City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 390 \n3  (1989)).  โThe need to act may be obvious because any reasonable person would recognize the \n4  need.โ  Id.  โUnlike the deliberate indifference standard used to determine if a violation of a \n5  detaineeโs rights to receive medical care took place, this standard does not contain a subjective \n6  component.โ  Id.  โ[T]he Canton standard assigns liability even when a municipality has \n7  constructive notice that it needs to remedy its omissions in order to avoid violations of \n8  constitutional rights.โ  Id. at 1187 n.8; see also Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 51, 1360 (2011) \n9  (holding that in the context of failure to train, a city may be deemed deliberately indifferent if its \n10  policymakers choose to retain a program despite โactual or constructive notice that a particular \n11  omission in their training program causes city employees to violate citizensโ constitutional \n12  rightsโ).6 \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13    The City argues that its policies and procedures for addressing detaineesโ mental health \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  needs are constitutionally adequate.  The City first points to its โBooking and Approval and \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Prisoner Release Policy,โ which at the time in question provided in relevant part that: \n sir\net  \ntatsiD 16  Upon arrest, the investigating officer shall visually inspect and question the \nS d nr prisoner to determine if there are any obvious signs of injury, illness or preexisting \nee 17  illness requiring immediate medical attention. This includes extreme intoxication or \nth\nintr narcotic influence.  \nUo\nN 18   \nIf any are found, the arresting officer shall immediately call emergency medical \n19  personnel to either treat the person in the field or transport to the hospital, \ndepending upon the circumstances. The Watch Commander shall be notified \n20  immediately. . . . \n \n21  The Field Supervisor should make every attempt to meet an officer at the jail  \n \n22  following each arrest to approve the booking and verify the arrestee does not \nrequire medical treatment prior to entry into the jail.  This can be done as part of the \n23 \n                                                 \n24 \n6 At the hearing, the Court asked the parties to submit supplemental briefing on the standard \napplicable to the deliberate indifference claim against the City in light of the Ninth Circuitโs recent \n25 \ndecision in Castro v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, 797 F.3d 654 (2015).  The Court read Castro to require \nthat a municipality have actual knowledge that its policy caused a substantial risk of serious harm \n26 \nto inmates and to preclude liability based upon constructive knowledge.  Following the submission \nof the requested supplemental briefing, en banc review of the panel decision was granted.  See \n27 \nCastro v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, No. 12-56829, 2015 WL 9596184 (Dec. 28, 2015).  The panel \ndecision may not be cited pending en banc review.  See id.  The Court thus applies the actual or \n28 \nconstructive notice standard articulated above. \n17 \n\n \n \n1   normal booking process. \n \n2  Once at the jail, the Police Service Technician (PST) shall promptly review any \nprior booking history in Net RMS involving the individual to determine if there \n3  were prior preexisting medical conditions (i.e. delirium tremens, etc.) for which the \narrestee was treated.  If such conditions are found, the PST shall notify the \n4  Watch Commander who shall determine if a medical clearance is required prior to \nbooking. \n5     \n6  Defs.โ Exh. H. \n7    The City also cites to its Prisoner Transport Policy, which sets forth guidelines regarding \n8  the logistics of transporting prisoners, including use of handcuffs, seating, and the maximum \n9  number of prisoners that may be transported in one vehicle, see Defs.โ Exh. I; the Pre-Booking \n10  Sheet that accompanies detainees when they are transferred to Monterey County, see Defs.โ Exh. \n11  E; and its Operations Manual, containing a Medical Evaluation and Treatment Policy, see Defs.โ \n12  Exh. J.  \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13    Plaintiffs point out that none of these policies requires any evaluation of detainees for \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  mental health issues by a medical professional, and in fact no medical professional does evaluate \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  detainees held by the City.  See Jackson Dep. 68:3-70:6, 89:7-10, 98:12-19, ECF 105-4.  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Moreover, Plaintiffs argue that the mental health assessment performed by PSTs is cursory and \nS d nr\nee 17  wholly inadequate to identify detainees at risk for suicide.  Out of 34 check-boxes, only two relate \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  to mental health, one of which asks โEver tried to hurt self?โ while the other is simply labeled \n19  โMentalโ with a small space for notes.  Booking Information, Exh. 15 to Tajsar Decl., ECF 105-2.  \n20  Officer Hallโs camera captured the audio of Claypoleโs screening by PST Bitter, which was fairly \n21  cursory.  See Video Footage, Exh. 115 to Tajsar Decl. (submitted manually).   \n22    The โduty to provide medical care encompasses detaineesโ psychiatric needs.โ  Gibson, \n23  290 F.3d at 1187.  โWhether a local government has displayed a policy of deliberate indifference \n24  to the constitutional rights of its citizens is generally a jury question.โ  Id. at 1194-95.  For \n25  example, in Gibson, the wife of a mentally ill detainee who died in a county jail brought a \n26  deliberate indifference claim asserting in part that the county lacked a policy directing the nurse \n27  who took control of prescription medications found on incoming detainees to consider those \n28  medications in evaluating the detaineesโ mental health needs.  The Ninth Circuit held that county \n18 \n\n \n1  policymakers actually knew that some detainees who arrived at the jail would have urgent medical \n2  and mental health needs, as evidenced by the policies that the county had in place.  Id. at 1195.  \n3  The court held that given that knowledge, the countyโs omission in policy could well result in a \n4  constitutional violation, particularly given another county policy forbidding medical evaluations \n5  on incoming detainees who are combative.  Id.  The court concluded that whether the countyโs \n6  policy amounted to deliberate indifference must go to a jury, noting that โ[w]hen policymakers \n7  know that their medical staff members will encounter those with urgent mental health needs yet \n8  fail to provide for the identification of those needs, it is obvious that a constitutional violation \n9  could well result.โ  Id. at 1196. \n10    Applying that rationale to the present case, the Court concludes that there are triable issues \n11  which must be resolved by a jury as to whether the Cityโs failure to implement more rigorous \n12  mental health screening, or to require transmission of detaineesโ mental health information to the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  next custodian, amounted to deliberate indifference.  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14        c.  Policy as Moving Force \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15    โFor a policy to be the moving force behind the deprivation of a constitutional right, the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  identified deficiency in the policy must be โclosely related to the ultimate injury.โโ  Long, 442 F.3d \nS d nr\nee 17  at 1190 (quoting Gibson, 290 F.3d at 1196).  โThe plaintiffโs burden is to establish that the injury \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  would have been avoided had proper policies been implemented.โ  Id. (internal quotation marks \n19  and citation omitted).  The City does not argue this element of Plaintiffsโ claim.       \n20      2.  Claim 3 โ Loss of Parent/Child Relationship in Violation of Fourteenth \n21        Amendment \n22    Parents may assert a Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claim if they are \n23  deprived of their liberty interest in the companionship of their child through official conduct.  \n24  Lemire v. Cal. Depโt of Corr. and Rehab., 726 F.3d 1062, 1075 (9th Cir. 2013).  โOnly official \n25  conduct that shocks the conscience is cognizable as a due process violation.โ  Id. (internal \n26  quotation marks and citation omitted).  โJust as the deliberate indifference of prison officials may \n27  support Eighth Amendment liability, such indifference may also rise to the conscience-shocking \n28  level required for substantive due process violation.โ  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation \n19 \n\n \n1  omitted).  โA prison officialโs deliberately indifferent conduct will generally shock the conscience \n2  so as long as the prison official had time to deliberate before acting or failing to act in a \n3  deliberately indifferent manner.โ  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \n4    The City seeks summary judgment on Claim 3 based upon its assertion that it is entitled to \n5  summary judgment on Plaintiffsโ deliberate indifference claim set forth in Claim 2.  As discussed \n6  above, triable issues of material fact preclude summary judgment on Claim 2.  As a result, the City \n7  has failed to establish that it is entitled to summary judgment on Claim 3.     \n8    III.  PLAINTIFFSโ MOTION TO SUBSTITUTE DETECTIVE KRUSE AS DOE \n9    Although Plaintiffs have elected not to pursue their ยง 1983 claims against Officer Hall, \n10  they wish to substitute Detective Kruse as a Doe defendant so that they may pursue ยง 1983 claims \n11  against him individually.  As discussed below, substitution of a new defendant in place of a Doe \n12  defendant is a state law concept that permits the claims against the new defendant to โrelate backโ \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  to the filing of the original complaint.       \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    A.  Relation Back Under State Law \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15    Where, as here, state law provides the applicable statute of limitations,7 an amended \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  complaint may relate back to the filing of the original complaint if it satisfies either state or federal \nS d nr\nee 17  law on relation back.  Butler v. Natโl Cmty. Renaissance of Cal., 766 F.3d 1191, 1200 (9th Cir. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  2014).  Under California law, โ[t]he general rule is that an amended complaint that adds a new \n19  defendant does not relate back to the date of filing the original complaint and the statute of \n20  limitations is applied as of the date the amended complaint is filed, not the date the original \n21  complaint is filed.โ  Woo v. Sup. Ct., 75 Cal. App. 4th 169, 176 (1999); see also Butler, 766 F.3d \n22  at 1201.  An exception to that general rule permits a plaintiff to substitute a new defendant for a \n23  fictitious Doe defendant named in the original complaint.  Woo, 75 Cal. App. 4th at 176.  \n24  However, in order to come under that exception the plaintiff must have been โgenuinely ignorantโ \n25  of the new defendantโs identity at the time the plaintiff filed the original complaint.  Id. at 177.   \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n7 Because ยง 1983 does not contain its own statute of limitations, claims brought under that statute \nare governed by Californiaโs statute of limitations for personal injury claims, which is two years.  \n28 \nButler v. Natโl Cmty. Renaissance of Cal., 766 F.3d 1191, 1198 (9th Cir. 2014). \n20 \n\n \n1    At the hearing, Plaintiffsโ counsel argued that Plaintiffs tried to act responsibly by naming \n2  only Hall in their initial complaint and refraining from a scattershot approach of naming all \n3  officers mentioned in the police reports.  Counsel asserted that they were not convinced that Kruse \n4  was a proper defendant until they deposed him in August 2015.  While it appreciates the motive \n5  articulated by counsel, the Court is at a loss to understand why counsel did not feel that Plaintiffs \n6  had enough information to assert a claim against Kruse based upon his police report, which \n7  Plaintiffs admittedly had before filing their original complaint in June 2014.  Kruseโs report, \n8  which is seventeen pages long, provides extensive detail regarding his interaction with Claypole \n9  on May 1, including the highlights of his interview with Claypole and an account of his trip to the \n10  hospital with Claypole for the ultimately unsuccessful blood draw.  That report contained all the \n11  information necessary to identify Kruse and his role in the case.  \n12    The Court notes that Plaintiffsโ counsel acknowledged at the hearing that Plaintiffs \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  received the video footage of Kruseโs custodial interview of Claypole in March 2015.  As \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  discussed above, that footage is among the most compelling evidence in the record that Claypole \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  was having a mental health crisis.  Yet Plaintiffs waited more than six more months after receiving \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  the video footage to file the present motion.  The fact that Plaintiffs waited so long even after \nS d nr\nee 17  receiving the video footage undermines their representation that their delay in seeking to add \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Kruse was caused by their ignorance of facts sufficient to put them on notice of their claim against \n19  him.   \n20    Because Plaintiffs had Kruseโs police report when they filed the original complaint, they \n21  do not satisfy the requirements for relation back under state law.  See Butler, 766 F.3d at 1202 \n22  (plaintiffโs addition of new defendants did not relate back under California law because plaintiff \n23  โwas not ignorantโ of their names or identities at the time the original complaint was filed). \n24    B.  Relation Back Under Federal Law \n25    Nor do Plaintiffs satisfy the requirements for relation back under federal law, which is set \n26  forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c).  Under that rule, an amended pleading relates back \n27  to the filing of the original complaint if the following requirements are met:  โ(1) the basic claim \n28  must have arisen out of the conduct set forth in the original pleading; (2) the party to be brought in \n21 \n\n \n1  must have received such notice that it will not be prejudiced in maintaining its defense; (3) that \n2  party must or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning identity, the action would \n3  have been brought against it.โ  Butler, 766 F.3d at 1191.  Relation back under the federal rule thus \n4  โdepends on what the party to be added knew or should have known, not on the amending partyโs \n5  knowledge or its timeliness in seeking to amend the pleading.โ  Krupski v. Costa Crociere, 560 \n6  U.S. 538, 541 (2010).   \n7    This action was filed in June 2014, a year and a half before Plaintiffs filed the present \n8  motion.  Kruse states in a declaration that he became aware of the lawsuit, and the fact that Officer \n9  Hall had been named as an individual defendant, in June 2014.  Kruse Decl. ยถ 6, ECF 114-1.  \n10  Kruse โtook a keen interestโ in the lawsuit because he was the detective assigned to investigate the \n11  murder.  Id.  Kruse knew that he had prepared a lengthy police report setting forth his interactions \n12  with Claypole and his involvement in the investigation.  Id. ยถ 9.  Kruse thought that Plaintiffs \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  could have and would have named him in the initial complaint had they wished to pursue claims \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  against him.  Id.  Plaintiffs have not presented evidence suggesting that Kruse had any reason to \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  believe that he would have been named as a defendant in the original complaint โbut for a mistake \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  concerning identity.โ   \nS d nr\nee 17    C.  Amendment Under Rule 15(a) \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18    In the event that the Court denies their request to substitute Kruse as a Doe defendant, \n19  Plaintiffs request leave to amend to add Kruse as a defendant under Federal Rule of Civil \n20  Procedure 15(a).  While a court should freely grant leave to amend when justice requires, Fed. R. \n21  Civ. P. 15(a)(2), leave need not be granted where amendment:  โ(1) prejudices the opposing party; \n22  (2) is sought in bad faith; (3) produces an undue delay in litigation; or (4) is futile.โ \n23  AmerisourceBergen Corp. v. Dialysist West, Inc., 465 F.3d 946, 951 (9th Cir. 2006) (citation \n24  omitted).  The City argues that amendment to add Kruse would be futile because, absent relation \n25  back, Plaintiffsโ proposed claims against Kruse are time-barred.   \n26    Plaintiffsโ proposed ยง 1983 claims are subject to a two-year statute of limitations.  See \n27  Butler, 766 F.3d at 1198.  Claypole hanged himself on May 4, 2013.  If Plaintiffsโ ยง 1983 claims \n28  against Kruse accrued on that date, the statute of limitations expired on May 4, 2015.  Plaintiffs \n22 \n\n \n1  assert that their claims against Kruse did not accrue until โthe breadth of his involvement in \n2  Claypoleโs arrest and custody were revealed during discovery.โ  Pls.โ Reply at 4, ECF 115.  \n3  Plaintiffs rely on Lukovsky, Wallace, Kubrick, and Davis, ignoring that in each of those cases the \n4  court found that the plaintiffโs claims were time-barred.   \n5    Plaintiffs state accurately that federal law determines when a civil rights claim accrues.  \n6  See Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 388 (2007).  However, Plaintiffs fail to identify the actual \n7  standards set forth by the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit.  Specifically, Plaintiffs ignore the \n8  requirement of diligence in pursuing discovery of fault and instead rely on โstray remarksโ from \n9  the cited cases which do not address the issue at hand.  See Lukovsky v. City & Cnty. of San \n10  Francisco, 535 F.3d 1044, 1051 (9th Cir. 2008). \n11    Plaintiffs rely on United States v. Kubrick, 444 U.S. 111 (1979), a medical malpractice \n12  case arising under the Federal Tort Claims Act in which the Supreme Court determined that: \n \na\ntr in  \nuoro 13  We thus cannot hold that Congress intended that โaccrualโ of a claim must await \nCfi\n tla awareness by the plaintiff that his injury was negligently inflicted.  A plaintiff such \nciC 14  as Kubrick, armed with the facts about the harm done to him, can protect himself \nrts fo by seeking advice in the medical and legal community.  To excuse him from \niD tc 15  promptly doing so by postponing the accrual of his claim would undermine the \n sir\net purpose of the limitations statute, which is to require the reasonably diligent \ntatsiD 16  presentation of tort claims against the Government. \nS d nr\nee 17  Id. at 123 (footnote omitted).   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18    In Davis v. United States, 642 F.2d 328 (9th Cir. 1981), the Ninth Circuit applied Kubrick \n19  to bar the action as untimely, holding that โ[i]n the absence of fraudulent concealment it is \n20  plaintiffโs burden, within the statutory period, to determine whether and whom to sue.  Kubrick \n21  makes this plain.โ  Id. at 331. \n22    In Lukovsky, the Ninth Circuit affirmed dismissal of an employment discrimination action, \n23  holding that โa claim accrues under federal law when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of \n24  the actual injury.โ  Lukovsky, 535 F.3d at 1048.  Nothing in the Lukovsky decision supports \n25  Plaintiffsโ contention that there would be a separate accrual date for each potential individual \n26  defendant where it was known on the date of the injury โ termination in the Lukovsky case โ that \n27  the employer was the cause of the injury.  Moreover, to allow such a floating accrual date would \n28  fly in the face of the Supreme Courtโs admonition:  โWere it otherwise, the statute would begin to \n23 \n\n \n1  run only after a plaintiff became satisfied that he had been harmed enough, placing the supposed \n2  statute of repose in the sole hands of the party seeking relief.โ  Wallace, 549 U.S. at 391. \n3    Entirely absent from the proposed amended complaint and Plaintiffsโ argument is any \n4  showing of diligence on their part in discovering Kruseโs role in the case or any concealment by \n5  the City.  Plaintiffsโ reliance on the timing of discovery responses is insufficient.  No explanation \n6  is offered why Plaintiffs delayed until late 2014 to seek written discovery and until August 2015 to \n7  depose Kruse.  The evidence shows that within a few days of her sonโs death, Ms. Guersenzvaig \n8  spoke to Kruse and learned that he was investigating the murder Claypole was alleged to have \n9  committed.  Police Report (Kruse) at 13-15, Defs.โ Exh. A, ECF 114-3.  As noted above, Plaintiffs \n10  also had obtained a copy of Kruseโs police report, documenting Kruseโs substantial contact with \n11  Claypole, prior to filing the original complaint.  Under these circumstances there is no evidence of \n12  diligence sufficient to delay the accrual of Plaintiffsโ claims against Kruse.  \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13    Because Plaintiffsโ proposed claims against Kruse are time-barred and thus futile, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  amendment is not warranted under Rule 15(a). \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15    D.  Conclusion \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16    Plaintiffsโ proposed ยง 1983 claims against Kruse are time-barred and Plaintiffs do not \nS d nr\nee 17  satisfy the requirements for relation back under either state or federal law.

MOTION; AND GRANTING IN PART \n10  MEDICAL DEFENDANTSโ MOTION \n  FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND \n11  DENYING PLAINTIFFSโ CROSS-\n  MOTION \n12 \n \na\ntr in   [Re:  ECF 124, 141, 142, 146] \nuoro 13       \nCfi\n tla  \nciC 14   \nrts fo\niD tc 15    This action follows the tragic deaths of two people, one of whom was Plaintiff Silvia \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Guersenzvaigโs son, Joshua Claypole.  Claypole, a young man with a history of mental health \nS d nr\nee 17  issues, inexplicably killed a taxi driver named Daniel Garcia Huerta and then days later hanged \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  himself in a Monterey County jail cell while detained for Huertaโs murder.  Guersenzvaig filed \n19  this action individually and on behalf of Claypoleโs estate, asserting that jail personnel and others \n20  were deliberately indifferent to Claypoleโs serious medical needs in violation of his federal \n21  constitutional rights and breached duties owed to him under state law.   \n22    Two sets of cross-motions for summary judgment are before the Court.  Defendants \n23  Monterey County, Monterey County Sheriff Scott Miller, and Sergeant Erika Kaye โ all involved \n24  in the operation of the jail โ seek summary judgment against Plaintiffs, who in turn seek partial \n25  summary judgment against them.  Additionally, Defendants Taylor Fithian and California \n26  Forensic Medical Group (โMedical Defendantsโ) โ the doctor and medical group who provide \n27  medical care at the jail โ seek partial summary judgment against Plaintiffs, who in turn seek partial \n28  summary judgment against them.   \n\n \n1    For the reasons discussed below, the County Defendantsโ motion is GRANTED IN PART, \n2  Plaintiffsโ cross-motion against the County Defendants is DENIED, the Medical Defendantsโ \n3  motion is GRANTED IN PART, and Plaintiffsโ cross-motion against the Medical Defendants is \n4  DENIED.     \n5    I.  BACKGROUND \n6    The chronology of events leading up to Claypoleโs death is largely undisputed.1  On the \n7  afternoon of Wednesday, May 1, 2013, Claypole murdered Huerta for unknown reasons.  City of \n8  Monterey police officers took him into custody shortly afterward, held him for several hours, and \n9  then transported him to the Monterey County jail.  Claypole was taken into custody at the jail at \n10  approximately 9:00 p.m. on Wednesday night.  He was placed in a single cell, pending review.  \n11    First Placement on Suicide Watch (Wednesday, May 1)  \n12    At approximately 10:15 p.m. that night, Claypole met with his attorney, who thereafter told \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  a jail employee named Candice McGregor that Claypole had said he wanted to kill himself.  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  McGregor called Defendant Kaye, the shift supervisor, and relayed what the attorney had said.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Kaye Dep. 79:13-23, Exh. F to Grant Decl., ECF 141-2.  Kaye immediately ordered that Claypole \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  be moved to a safety cell and placed on suicide watch.  Id. 82:21-83:3.   Safety cells at the County \nS d nr\nee 17  jail are small cells with padded rubber walls.  They do not contain furniture, mattress, or blanket, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  and a grate in the floor is used in lieu of a toilet.  Detainees and inmates placed on suicide watch \n19  are clothed in safety smocks.  Kaye personally supervised Claypoleโs placement in a safety cell \n20  and she explained to him that he was being placed in the cell because of his attorneyโs concerns.  \n21  Id. 90:13-21.  Kaye or another deputy then advised the jailโs medical staff via radio that someone \n22  had been placed in a safety cell for suicide watch.  Id. 97:20-98:6.  \n23    Monterey County contracts with Defendant California Forensic Medical Group (โCFMGโ) \n24  to provide health care at the jail, including mental health treatment.  In the very early hours of \n25  Thursday, May 2, 2013, Nurse Lavina Shene screened Claypole using CFMGโs Nursing \n26 \n                                                 \n27 \n1 As discussed below, there are significant factual disputes with respect to material issues \nunrelated to chronology that preclude summary judgment on most of the claims addressed in these \n28 \nmotions. \n2 \n\n \n1  Assessment of Psychiatric & Suicidal Inmate form.  Shene noted that Claypole reported a \n2  psychiatric history; had been diagnosed with anxiety, attention deficit disorder, and insomnia; was \n3  under the care of a psychiatrist; and had prescriptions for Klonopin, Seroquel, and Adderal, which \n4  he last had taken two days prior.  Shene noted that Claypole had poor eye contact, was calm, and \n5  had a flat affect.  She identified him as a danger to self on the suicide log and indicated that he was \n6  to remain on suicide watch.   \n7    At approximately 5:50 a.m., shortly before the end of her shift, Shene called Defendant \n8  Taylor Fithian, M.D., to inform him that Claypole had been placed on suicide watch.  Defendant \n9  Fithian is the president and co-founder of CFMG.  During the relevant time frame, he was \n10  CFMGโs medical director as well as the psychiatrist and supervisor in charge of all other mental \n11  health staff at the jail.  Fithian was responsible for development of CFMGโs policies and \n12  procedures and the overall day-to-day practice of medicine at the jail. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13    First Removal from Suicide Watch (Thursday, May 2)   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    Fithian met with Claypole at approximately 8:35 a.m. on Thursday, May 2, 2013, and \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  discontinued suicide watch at approximately 9:00 a.m.  Claypole remained in the safety cell for \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  some period of time โ exactly how long is disputed by the parties โ before he was transferred to \nS d nr\nee 17  cell A204 in โA-pod.โ  A-pod and B-pod are units consisting of single cells that predominantly are \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  used to house individuals with mental health needs.  Bass Dep. 75:7-79:24, Exh. Vol. 3 to Rifkin \n19  Decl., ECF 147-5.  Other units, including C-pod, are used as overflow housing for individuals \n20  with mental health needs.  Id.  A-pod, B-pod, and C-pod are โlockdownโ units, meaning that \n21  individuals housed there generally are locked in their cells for approximately twenty-three hours a \n22  day and permitted to use the dayroom, take a shower, or do other activities outside the cell for \n23  approximately one hour a day.  Id.  Individuals housed in lockdown units also are permitted to \n24  come out for visits, court or medical appointments, and certain jail events.  Id.  Individuals with \n25  mental health needs are housed in A-pod and B-pod because they are single cells, and thus the \n26  risks of assaults between inmates is lessened.  Id. 75:17-76:3. \n27    The lockdown cells contain beds with sheets.  Bass Dep. 104:21-105:7, Exh. Vol. 3 to \n28  Rifkin Decl., ECF 147-5.  In 2013, when Claypole was housed in A-pod, the lockdown cells had \n3 \n\n \n1  air vents in the walls or ceilings that could be used as attachment points for suicide by hanging.  \n2  Id. 105:14-106:15, 110:7-19.  A single deputy is stationed in the corridor to monitor A-pod, B-\n3  pod, and C-pod.   Id.  From that station, the deputy can see into all of B-pod but only part of A-\n4  pod.  Id. 85:17-87:8.  The deputy cannot see into cell A204, where Claypole was housed, from the \n5  corridor.  Id. 86:25-87:8.  The deputy does hourly welfare and safety checks of the pod cells.  Id. \n6  104:8-20.  Those hourly checks consist of walking through both tiers of each pod and can \n7  completed within one or two minutes.  Id. 90:2-19.  No additional safety checks are performed \n8  when an individual is placed in a lockdown cell upon release from suicide watch.  Id. 104:8-12. \n9    Second Placement on Suicide Watch (Friday, May 3) \n10    Claypole was not seen by mental health personnel again until Friday, May 3, 2013.  On \n11  Friday afternoon, he was visited by Kim Spano, a marriage and family therapist employed by \n12  CFMG.  Spanoโs notes reflect that Claypole was โodd,โ โin a bizarre state,โ โunsettled,โ and \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  โ[a]gitated, upset.โ  Spano Dep. 95:7-14, Exh. I to Grant Decl., ECF 149-1.  Spano felt that \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Claypole was โclearly deludedโ and โclearly psychotic.โ  Id. 101:1-7.  Spano recalls calling \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Defendant Fithian and either speaking to him or leaving him a voicemail message regarding \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Claypoleโs condition.  Id. 101:13-102:4.  Fithian recalls that he and Spano spoke.  Fithian Decl. ยถ \nS d nr\nee 17  6, ECF 152-4.  Fithian and Spano agreed that Claypole should be placed in a safety cell.  Id.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Claypole was removed from cell A204 and placed in a safety cell. \n19    When Nurse Shene came on duty the night of May 3, 2013, she reviewed the safety log but \n20  not Spanoโs progress notes, and she checked on Claypole twice during the early morning hours.  \n21  Shene Dep. 76:5-78:5, Exh. J to Grant Decl., ECF 149-1.  At the 5:15 a.m. check, Shene spoke to \n22  Claypole and noted that he denied suicidal ideation, he verbally contracted for safety, and he \n23  agreed to let staff know if he felt like he was going to harm himself or others.  Id. 78:4-25.  \n24  Claypole also asked to be removed from the safety cell and requested sleeping medication.  Id. \n25  79:6-7.   \n26    Second Removal from Suicide Watch (Saturday, May 4) \n27    Shortly after 6:00 a.m. on Saturday, May 4, 2013, Shene called Defendant Fithian and \n28  reported that Claypole had denied suicidal ideation, verbally contracted for safety, said he was \n4 \n\n \n1  really tired, and requested sleep medications.  Shene Dep. 83:21-84:11, Exh. J to Grant Decl., ECF \n2  149-1.  Defendant Fithian, who had not seen Claypole since Thursday, May 2, gave Shene a \n3  verbal order to discontinue suicide watch.  Id. 84:12-14.  Claypole remained in the safety cell for \n4  some period of time โ jail records are unclear as to how long โ and then he was returned to cell \n5  A204 in A-pod.  While conducting a safety and welfare check of A-pod at approximately 2:30 \n6  p.m. that afternoon, Deputy Raymond Gordano saw Claypole hanging from a bedsheet affixed to a \n7  metal vent above the toilet/sink area.  Gordano used his radio to call another deputy for help and \n8  then called for medical help.  The deputies cut Claypole down and performed mouth-to-mouth \n9  breathing and chest compressions until medical staff arrived to relieve them.  Claypole died \n10  several days later when he was taken off life support.2 \n11    II.  LEGAL STANDARD \n12    โA party is entitled to summary judgment if the โmovant shows that there is no genuine \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.โโ  City of \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Pomona v. SQM North America Corp., 750 F.3d 1036, 1049 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  P. 56(a)).  โThe moving party initially bears the burden of proving the absence of a genuine issue \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  of material fact.โ  In re Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., 627 F.3d 376, 387 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing Celotex \nS d nr\nee 17  Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986)).  โWhere the non-moving party bears the burden of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  proof at trial, the moving party need only prove that there is an absence of evidence to support the \n19  non-moving partyโs case.โ  Id. โWhere the moving party meets that burden, the burden then shifts \n20  to the non-moving party to designate specific facts demonstrating the existence of genuine issues \n21  for trial.โ  Id.  โ[T]he non-moving party must come forth with evidence from which a jury could \n22  reasonably render a verdict in the non-moving partyโs favor.โ  Id.  โThe court must view the \n23  evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and draw all reasonable inferences in the \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n2 To the extent that any party has argued additional facts in its separate statement that were not \npresented in the briefs, those arguments are disregarded as violating this Courtโs Standing Order \n26 \nRe Civil Cases and Civil Local Rules.  See Standing Order Re Civil Cases ยถ F.3.a (โThe Court will \nnot consider evidence or argument presented in the Separate Statement that is not also contained in \n27 \nthe briefs.โ); Civ. L.R. 7-2, 7-3 (limiting moving and opposing briefs to 25 pages).  The purpose of \nthe separate statement is limited to providing the Court with a chart of relevant evidence set forth \n28 \nin the briefs.  It is not an augmentation of the briefs. \n5 \n\n \n1  nonmovantโs favor.โ  City of Pomona, 750 F.3d at 1049.  โโWhere the record taken as a whole \n2  could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue for \n3  trial.โโ  Id. (quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587  \n4  (1986)). \n5    III.  CROSS-MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT RE COUNTY DEFENDANTS \n6    Plaintiffs assert claims against Monterey County, Monterey County Sheriff Miller in his \n7  official and individual capacities, and Sergeant Kaye under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for deliberate \n8  indifference to Claypoleโs serious medical needs in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment \n9  (Claims 1 and 2) and deprivation of the parent/child relationship in violation of the First and \n10  Fourteenth Amendments (Claim 3).  Plaintiffs also assert state law claims for failure to summon \n11  medical care in violation of California Government Code ยง 845.6 (Claim 5); negligent \n12  supervision, training, hiring, and retention under California law (Claim 6); wrongful death under \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  California Civil Procedure Code ยง 377.60 (Claim 7); and negligence under California law (Claim \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  8).  The County Defendants seek summary judgment on all of these claims, while Plaintiffs seek \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  summary judgment on Claims 1-3 and 8. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16    A.  Claims 1 and 2 โ Deliberate Indifference \nS d nr\nee 17    โThe Eighth Amendment protects inmates from cruel and unusual punishment, which \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  includes the denial of medical care.โ  Conn v. City of Reno, 591 F.3d 1081, 1094 (9th Cir. 2009), \n19  vacated, 131 S. Ct. 1812 (2011), reinstated in part and vacated in part, 658 F.3d 897 (9th Cir. \n20  2011).  โPretrial detainees, by contrast, are protected under the Due Process Clause of the \n21  Fourteenth Amendment.โ  Id.  Courts have borrowed from the Eighth Amendment jurisprudence \n22  to determine the minimum standard of care that must be given to a pretrial detainee under the \n23  Fourteenth Amendment.  Id.; Simmons v. Navajo Cnty., 609 F.3d 1011, 1017 (9th Cir. 2010) \n24  (โAlthough the Fourteenth Amendmentโs Due Process Clause, rather than the Eighth \n25  Amendmentโs protection against cruel and unusual punishment, applies to pretrial detainees, we \n26  apply the same standards in both cases.โ) (internal citation omitted); Gibson v. Cnty. of Washoe, \n27  290 F.3d 1175, 1187 (9th Cir. 2002) (โWith regard to medical needs, the due process clause \n28  imposes, at minimum, the same duty as the Eighth Amendment imposes.โ).  โThe Eighth and \n6 \n\n \n1  Fourteenth Amendments both guarantee that inmates and detainees receive constitutionally \n2  adequate medical and mental health care.โ  Conn, 591 F.3d at 1094. \n3      1.  County of Monterey and Miller in his Official Capacity \n4    Plaintiffsโ claims against the County and against Sheriff Miller in his official capacity are \n5  essentially the same claims.  See Monell v. New York City Depโt of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690 \n6  n.55 (1978) (โofficial-capacity suits generally represent only another way of pleading an action \n7  against an entity of which an officer is an agentโ).  Accordingly, this orderโs discussion of \n8  Plaintiffsโ claims against the โCountyโ encompasses Plaintiffsโ claims against Sheriff Miller in his \n9  official capacity.  Plaintiffs and the County have filed cross-motions for summary judgment on \n10  Claims 1 and 2 for deliberate indifference.  \n11    Plaintiffs may recover against the County on their deliberate indifference claims under one \n12  of three theories of liability.  See Clouthier v. Cnty. of Contra Costa, 591 F.3d 1232, 1249 (9th \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Cir. 2010).  โFirst, a local government may be held liable โwhen implementation of its official \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  policies or established customs inflicts the constitutional injury.โโ  Id. (quoting Monell, 436 U.S. at \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  708 (Powell, J. concurring)).  Courts have โreferred to these sorts of local government conduct as \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  acts of โcommission.โโ  Id.  โSecond, under certain circumstances, a local government may be held \nS d nr\nee 17  liable under ยง 1983 for acts of โomission,โ when such omissions amount to the local governmentโs \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  own official policy.โ  Id.  โTo impose liability on a local government for failure to adequately train \n19  its employees, the governmentโs omission must amount to โdeliberate indifferenceโ to a \n20  constitutional right.โ  Id.  โThis standard is met when the need for more or different training is so \n21  obvious, and the inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights, that the \n22  policymakers of the city can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.โ  \n23  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  โThird, a local government may be held liable \n24  under ยง 1983 when the individual who committed the constitutional tort was an official with final \n25  policy-making authority or such an official ratified a subordinateโs unconstitutional decision or \n26  action and the basis for it.โ  Id. at 1250 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \n27    Plaintiffs appear to be proceeding under both the first and second theories of liability set \n28  forth in Clouthier.  Under the first theory, Plaintiffs challenge the Countyโs jail policies and \n7 \n\n \n1  procedures as constitutionally deficient.   Plaintiffs do not clearly identify the specific policies and \n2  procedures at issue.  In the operative first amended complaint, Plaintiffs identify the relevant \n3  policies and procedures extremely broadly, alleging that โDefendants have inadequate policies, \n4  procedures, and practices for identifying inmates in need of medical and mental health treatment \n5  and providing appropriate medical and mental health treatment.โ  FAC ยถ 83.  In some portions of \n6  their briefing, Plaintiffs narrow the challenged policy somewhat to:  โhousing inmates with mental \n7  illness in segregation units such as the A and B pod lockdown units.โ  See, e.g.,Pls.โ Mot. at 6, \n8  ECF 146; Pls.โ Opp. at 9, ECF 148.  In other portions of their briefing, Plaintiffs narrow the \n9  challenged policy further to:  housing inmates with mental illness in lockdown cells with known \n10  suicide hazards, i.e., hanging points, upon releasing those inmates from suicide watch.  See, e.g., \n11  Pls.โ Mot. at 1, ECF 146; Pls.โ Reply at 1, ECF 156.  Based upon the entirety of Plaintiffsโ briefing \n12  on the pending motions, and the evidence upon which Plaintiffs rely, it appears that the latter \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  characterization most effectively captures Plaintiffsโ theory based upon an asserted \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  unconstitutional jail policy.     \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15    Under the second theory set forth in Clouthier, Plaintiffs contend that the County failed to \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  engage in adequate oversight of CFMG, the private entity with whom the County contracts to \nS d nr\nee 17  provide medical and mental health services at the jail.   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18    The partiesโ cross-motions regarding Plaintiffsโ claims based upon these two theories of \n19  liability are addressed as follows. \n20        a.  Policy of Housing Inmates with Mental Illness in Lockdown  \n21          Cells with Known Suicide Hazards Upon Releasing those  \n22          Inmates from Suicide Watch \n23    In order to establish their entitlement to summary judgment based upon the Countyโs \n24  allegedly unconstitutional policy of housing inmates with mental illness in lockdown cells with \n25  known suicide hazards upon those inmatesโ release from suicide watch, Plaintiffs must \n26  demonstrate that the policy posed a substantial risk of harm to Claypole, the County was aware of \n27  the risk, and the policy in fact caused harm.  See Gibson, 290 F.3d at 1188-89.  Whether the \n28  Countyโs policy violated Claypoleโs rights โdoes not hinge on whether County policymakers knew \n8 \n\n \n1  that the Countyโs polic[y] would pose a substantial risk of serious harm to [Claypole], in \n2  particular.โ  Id. at 1191.  Plaintiffs must show only that the policy would pose a risk to someone in \n3  Claypoleโs situation.3  Id.    \n4    Plaintiffs submit the following evidence in support of their motion and in opposition to the \n5  Countyโs motion.  Commander Bass, the Countyโs Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6) \n6  witness on the jailโs policies and procedures, testified extensively regarding the types of housing \n7  available at the jail and in particular the details of A-pod, where Claypole was housed after being \n8  removed from suicide watch on May 2, 2013 and again on May 4, 2013.  A-pod consists of single \n9  cells that predominantly are used to house individuals with mental health needs.  Bass Dep. 75:7-\n10  79:24, Exh. Vol. 3 to Rifkin Decl., ECF 147-5.  A-pod is a โlockdownโ unit, meaning that \n11  individuals housed there generally are locked in their cells for approximately twenty-three hours a \n12  day, although exceptions are permitted for visits, court or medical appointments, and certain jail \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  events.  Id.   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    A single deputy is stationed in the corridor to monitor A-pod as well as two other \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  lockdown units, B-pod, and C-pod.  Bass Dep. 85:10-16, Exh. Vol. 3 to Rifkin Decl., ECF 147-5.   \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  From that station, the deputy can see into all of B-pod but only part of A-pod.  Id. 85:17-87:8.  \nS d nr\nee 17  The deputy cannot see into cell A204, where Claypole was housed, from the station in the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  corridor.  Id. 86:25-87:8.  The deputy does hourly welfare and safety checks of the pod cells.  Id. \n19  104:8-20.  Those hourly checks consist of walking through both tiers of each pod and can be done \n20  as quickly as one or two minutes.  Id. 90:2-19.  No additional precautions or procedures are used \n21  for individuals who are moved to A-pod after being discharged from suicide watch.  Id. 105:8-13. \n22    The lockdown cells contain beds with sheets.  Bass Dep. 104:21-105:7, Exh. Vol. 3 to \n23  Rifkin Decl., ECF 147-5.  In 2013, the lockdown cells also had air vents in the walls or ceilings \n24  that could be used as attachment points for suicide by hanging.  Id. 105:14-106:15, 110:7-19.  \n25  Prior to 2013, there were at least two suicides by hanging in lockdown cells, one in 2010 and one \n26 \n                                                 \n3 The Court notes that the County relies heavily on cases addressing the standards for determining \n27 \nwhether an individual officer acted with deliberate indifference.  While those cases are relevant to \nthe motions regarding the individual liability of Miller and Kaye, they do not set forth the proper \n28 \nstandards for evaluating Plaintiffsโ claim that the Countyโs policy was constitutionally deficient. \n9 \n\n \n1  in 2011.  Id. 110:1-19.  County records show that between 2011 and 2012 at least five other \n2  individuals attempted to hang themselves with bedsheets, at least three of which were attached to \n3  vent or grates in their cells.  Records, Exh. D to Rifkin Decl., ECF 147-8.  Dr. Richard Hayward4, \n4  one of the Medical Defendantsโ retained experts, testified that the lockdown units at the jail \n5  contained suicide hazards.  Hayward Dep. 144:25-145:6, Exh. T to Grant Decl., ECF 149-1. \n6    Absent conflicting evidence sufficient to demonstrate the existence of disputed issues of \n7  material fact, Plaintiffsโ evidence is sufficient to establish that the Countyโs challenged policy \n8  posed a substantial risk of harm to inmates, the County was aware of that risk, and the Countyโs \n9  transfer of Claypole to A-pod after his release from suicide watch on May 4, 2013 (pursuant to the \n10  challenged policy) resulted in Claypoleโs suicide. \n11    In opposition to Plaintiffsโ motion and in support of its own motion, the County submits \n12  the declaration of Commander Johnathan Thornburg, who states that between 2010 and 2015, the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  County jail processed an average of 11,900 new detainees/inmates a year.  Thornburg Decl. ยถยถ 3-\nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  5, ECF 149-2.  During that six-year period, the County jail had a total of six suicides by hanging.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Id.  The County argues that those statistics actually are very good, and certainly are not so extreme \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  as to render obvious the risk of suicide posed by the lockdown units.  \nS d nr\nee 17    The County also submits the report and supplemental report of its expert, Richard S. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Bryce.  See Bryce Report, Exh. L to Grant Decl., ECF 141-2; Bryce Suppl. Report, Exh. M To \n19  Grant Decl., ECF 141-2.  Mr. Bryce opines in his report that Sheriff Miller and all jail personnel \n20  โutilized all practices and facilities available to them to protect the welfare and safety of Mr. \n21  Claypole while he was in their custody.โ  Bryce Report at 1, Exh. L to Grant Decl., ECF 141-2.  \n22  Mr. Bryce opines in his supplemental report that Claypole was the subject of more than 100 \n23 \n                                                 \n4 Dr. Hayward previously authored a report on the mental health conditions of the Monterey \n24 \nCounty jail in connection with another case currently pending in this district, Hernandez v. Cnty. \nof Monterey, Case No. 5:13-CV-2354-PSG.  Plaintiffs quote the draft report in their operative first \n25 \namended complaint and in their briefing on the present motions.  Fithian and CFMG object to \nPlaintiffsโ reliance on the Hayward draft report, asserting that Plaintiffs rely upon portions of the \n26 \ndraft report that were negated by the final report.  The Court concludes that the prior Hayward \nreport is of limited value with respect to the pending motions.  The Court has reviewed the orders \n27 \nissued in Hernandez and the prior Hayward report only for the purpose of providing background \ncontext for the present case.  \n28 \n \n10 \n\n \n1  welfare checks while confined at the jail.5  Bryce Suppl. Report at 1, Exh. M To Grant Decl., ECF \n2  141-2.  \n3    Finally, the County points to its policy requiring medical clearance before an individual \n4  can be moved from a safety cell into other housing.  See Inmate Services Policy ยง M-2, Exh. N to \n5  Grant Decl., ECF 149-1.  It is undisputed that Dr. Fithian released Claypole from suicide watch \n6  before he was moved back to A-pod.  The County argues that in moving Claypole back and forth \n7  between safety cells and lockdown cells, the County reasonably relied on the decisions of medical \n8  personnel.   \n9    On the latter point, the County cites Lemire v. Cal. Depโt of Corr. & Rehab., 726 F.3d \n10  1062 (9th Cir. 2013) for the proposition that reliance on medical staff bars a finding of deliberate \n11  indifference.  In the cited portion of Lemire, the Ninth Circuit discussed the plaintiffsโ deliberate \n12  indifference claim against five correctional officers who failed to give CPR to an inmate found \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  unconscious on the floor of his cell with a sheet around his neck.  All five officers arrived at the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  cell after the first medical staff responded, and while medical staff assisted the inmate the five \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  officers performed other functions such as securing the scene or documenting the incident.  Under \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  those circumstances, the Ninth Circuit concluded, the five correctional officers could not be found \nS d nr\nee 17  to have acted deliberately indifferent to the inmateโs medical needs โbecause they were reasonably \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  relying on the actions of the medical responders who were already treatingโ the inmate.  Id. at \n19  1084.  The Ninth Circuitโs holding clearly was based upon the particular facts of the case before it.  \n20  There is no indication that the holding was intended as a general statement that reliance upon \n21  advice of medical staff raises an absolute bar to a deliberate indifference claim.  Thus the Countyโs \n22  reliance upon Lemire is misplaced. \n23    However, the existence of the policy requiring medical clearance before moving inmates, \n24  in combination with Dr. Fithianโs order to release Claypole from suicide watch without any \n25  accompanying orders regarding step down housing6 or other additional precautions, could give \n26 \n                                                 \n5 Plaintiffs dispute that all of the claimed welfare checks actually occurred, pointing to evidence \n27 \nthat the logs regarding Claypoleโs checks were incorrect in some respects and that the jailโs logs \ngenerally may be incorrect.  See Kaye Dep. 126:17-130:9, Miller Dep. 18:2-8, 52:2-20, 54:6-16.   \n28 \n6 Dr. Fithian states in his declaration that he could have ordered that Claypole be placed in a step \n11 \n\n \n1  rise to an inference that that the Countyโs policies did not cause Claypoleโs injury but rather Dr. \n2  Fithianโs medical decision did.  That inference is sufficient to create a disputed issue of fact as to \n3  causation.  Moreover, the Countyโs statistical evidence is sufficient to create a disputed issue of \n4  fact as to the Countyโs knowledge of the risk to inmates created by its policy of placing \n5  individuals with mental health issues in A-pod upon release from suicide watch.  Finally, the \n6  expert opinion of Mr. Bryce is sufficient to create a disputed issue of fact as to the constitutional \n7  adequacy of the Countyโs policies as a whole. \n8    A reasonable jury could resolve the disputed issues of material fact identified above in \n9  favor of either Plaintiffs or the County, and thus could find for either Plaintiffs or the County on \n10  Claims 1 and 2.  Accordingly, the partiesโ cross-motions for summary judgment on Claims 1 and 2 \n11  are DENIED as to the County and Sheriff Miller in his official capacity. \n12        b.  Failure to Adequately Supervise CFMG \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13    In order to establish their entitlement to summary judgment based upon the Countyโs \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  alleged failure to adequately supervise CFMG, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that the Countyโs \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  failure to supervise violated its own obligation to provide adequate medical care and that the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  failure resulted in harm to Claypole.  See Armstrong v. Schwarzenegger, 622 F.3d 1058, 1074 (9th \nS d nr\nee 17  Cir. 2010) (โ[A] State cannot avoid its obligations under federal law by contracting with a third \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  party to perform its functions. The rights of individuals are not so ethereal nor so easily \n19  avoided.โ). \n20    In support of their motion and in opposition to the Countyโs motion, Plaintiffs present \n21  evidence that Sheriff Miller โ the individual responsible for implementing the jailโs policies and \n22  procedures โ did not review the mental health care provided to jail inmates by CFMG.  Miller \n23  Dep. 30:9-12, 58:7-17, 59:11-60:10, ECF 147-6.  Neither Miller nor anyone else in the Sheriffโs \n24  Office was aware of how CFMG staffed the jail.  Id. 66:22-67:10.  Miller did not know that \n25  CFMG did not staff the jail with mental health clinicians on weekends.  Id. 66:13-21.  Miller did \n26 \n                                                                                                                                                                \ndown unit.  Fithian Decl. ยถ 11, ECF 152-4.  Commander Bass, the Countyโs Rule 30(b)(6) witness, \n27 \ntestified that the jail does not have any kind of step down cells or transition cells between a safety \ncell and a regular housing cell.  Bass Dep. 103:17-21, Exh. Vol. 3 to Rifkin Decl., ECF 147-5. \n28 \n \n12 \n\n \n1  not inquire of CFMG whether they had conducted an internal review following the 2010 and 2011 \n2  suicides at the jail.  Id. 116:9-119:16. \n3    In opposition to Plaintiffsโ motion and in support of its own motion, the County submits \n4  Millerโs deposition testimony that he reviewed jail conditions with shift supervisors and jail \n5  command staff, reviewed written reports, attended quality assurance meetings, and instituted \n6  investigations into all in-custody deaths.  Miller Dep. 25:20-30:5, 45:18-46:24, 55:20-58:25, 61:3-\n7  62:1, 93:22-95:24, Exh. S to Grant Decl., ECF 149-1. \n8    The competing excerpts of Sheriff Millerโs deposition testimony cited by the parties create \n9  a disputed issue of fact as to the extent of Millerโs oversight of CFMG as part of his oversight of \n10  the jail generally.  Moreover, with respect to the issue of causation, disputed issues of fact exist as \n11  to the majority of Plaintiffsโ claims against CFMG for the reasons discussed in section IV, below.  \n12  Those disputed issues preclude summary judgment for either party, because if CFMG provided \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  adequate medical care to Claypole, then no harm resulted from the Countyโs alleged lack of \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  oversight over CFMG. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15    Accordingly, the partiesโ cross-motions for summary judgment on Claims 1 and 2 for \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  deliberate indifference based upon the Countyโs alleged failure to adequately supervise CFMG are \nS d nr\nee 17  DENIED.   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18      2.  Sheriff Miller \n19    Plaintiffs sue Sheriff Miller in his individual capacity as well as his official capacity.  \n20  Plaintiffs and Miller have filed cross-motions for summary judgment on Claims 1 and 2. \n21    In order to establish their entitlement to summary judgment against Miller in his individual \n22  capacity, Plaintiffs must show that Miller set in motion acts which caused others to inflict \n23  constitutional injury.  Larez v. City of Los Angeles, 946 F.2d 630, 645 (9th Cir. 1991).  Such \n24  conduct may include culpable action or inaction in the training of subordinates, acquiescence in a \n25  constitutional deprivation, or conduct showing indifference to the rights of others.  Id. at 646.   \n26    In support of their motion and in opposition to Millerโs motion, Plaintiffs submit evidence \n27  that Sheriff Miller was the individual responsible for implementing the jailโs policies and \n28  procedures.  Miller Dep. 30:9-12, ECF 147-6.  He could make changes to those policies and \n13 \n\n \n1  procedures.  Id. 30:16-31:23.  Sheriff Miller admitted that he โwas responsible for everything that \n2  happened or didnโt happen at the Sheriffโs Officeโ while he was Sheriff.  Id. 31:21-23.  The \n3  responsibilities of the Sheriffโs Office included responsibility for the jail.  Id. 55:16-19. \n4    Miller was aware that the jailโs policy was to house inmates with mental health issues in \n5  segregated, lockdown cells.  Miller Dep. 73:7-13, ECF 147-6.  He reviewed a Jail Needs \n6  Assessment prepared in 2011 which indicated, among other things, that โSuicide hazard \n7  elimination is not as stringent as it should be to prevent self-harm and the attendant liability.โ  Id. \n8  78:3-23.  When Miller took office in December 2010, he was aware that an inmate had committed \n9  suicide in August 2010.  Id. 91:14-17.  Miller also was informed when an inmate committed \n10  suicide in 2011.  Id. 92:16-19.  As discussed above, some of Millerโs testimony indicates that he \n11  did not review the mental health care provided to jail inmates by CFMG.  Miller Dep. 58:7-17, \n12  59:11-60:10, 66:22-67:10,116:9-119:16 ECF 147-6.   \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13    In opposition to Plaintiffsโ motion and in support of his own motion, Miller submits \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Commander Thornburgโs declaration regarding the number of jail suicides compared to the total \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  number of inmates housed at the jail, and argues that the relatively few number of suicides at the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  jail were insufficient to put him on notice that the policy posed a substantial risk of harm.  See \nS d nr\nee 17  Thornburg Decl. ยถยถ 3-5, ECF 149-2.  Miller also submits declaration excerpts suggesting that he \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  did engage in at least some oversight of the medical care provided at the jail.  Miller Dep. 25:20-\n19  30:5, 45:18-46:24, 55:20-58:25, 61:3-62:1, 93:22-95:24, Exh. S to Grant Decl., ECF 149-1.  \n20    Based upon the partiesโ evidence, there are disputed issues of fact as to Millerโs knowledge \n21  of the risk posed by the Countyโs policy of housing inmates with mental illness โ and in particular \n22  those just released from suicide watch โ in lockdown units with known suicide risks.  In addition, \n23  there is a disputed issue of fact as to the extent of Millerโs oversight over CFMG.  Finally, there is \n24  a disputed issue as to whether any failure to supervise CFMG caused injury in light of the disputed \n25  facts that preclude summary judgment on most of Plaintiffsโ claims against CFMG, as discussed in \n26  section IV, below.   \n27    Accordingly, the partiesโ cross-motions for summary judgment on Claims 1 and 2 against \n28  Miller in his individual capacity are DENIED.   \n14 \n\n \n1      3.  Sergeant Kaye \n2    Both Plaintiffs and Sergeant Kaye seek summary judgment on Claims 1 and 2.    \n3    โAn officialโs deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to an inmate โ \n4  including the deprivation of a serious medical need โ violates the Eighth Amendment, and a \n5  fortiori, the Fourteenth Amendment.โ  Conn, 591 F.3d at 1094; see also Gibson, 290 F.3d at 1187 \n6  (โpersons in custody have the established right to not have officials remain deliberately indifferent \n7  to their serious medical needsโ) (quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted).   \n8    To demonstrate that Kaye was deliberately indifferent in this case, Plaintiffs must show \n9  that (1) Claypole had a serious medical need and (2) Kayeโs officialโs response to the need was \n10  deliberately indifferent.  See Conn, 591 F.3d  at 1095; see also Simmons, 609 F.3d at 1017 (โWe \n11  have long analyzed claims that correction facility officials violated pretrial detaineesโ \n12  constitutional rights by failing to address their medical needs (including suicide prevention) under \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  a deliberate indifference standard.โ) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  โThe second \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  prong requires both (a) a purposeful act or failure to respond to a prisonerโs pain or possible \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  medical need and (b) harm caused by the indifference.โ  Conn, 591 F.3d  at 1095.  Thus to make \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  out a claim of deliberate indifference, Plaintiffs must establish โserious medical need, indifference \nS d nr\nee 17  to that need, and harm caused by that indifference.โ  Id.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18        a.  Indifference to Serious Medical Need \n19    To demonstrate the requisite indifference, Plaintiffs must show that Kaye was โ(a) \n20  subjectively aware of the serious medical need and (b) failed to adequately respond.โ  Conn, 591 \n21  F.3d at 1096 (citing Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 838 (1994)).  Plaintiffs contend that \n22  although Kaye clearly was aware of Claypoleโs serious medical need and responded to that need, \n23  her response was inadequate.  \n24    In support of their own motion and in opposition to Kayeโs motion, Plaintiffs present \n25  evidence that although Kaye informed medical staff that Claypole had been placed on suicide \n26  watch, she did not also document and inform medical staff that Claypole had made a suicidal \n27  statement to his attorney.  In particular, Plaintiffs rely on Dr. Fithianโs testimony that he believed \n28  Claypole was placed on suicide watch because of the charges against him rather than any suicidal \n15 \n\n \n1  ideation, as well as Fithianโs denial that medical staff was told of Claypoleโs statements to his \n2  attorney.  Fithian Dep. 124:21-126:9, ECF 143-10.  Plaintiffs contend that under Conn, Kayeโs \n3  failure to inform medical staff of Claypoleโs suicidal statement to his attorney rendered inadequate \n4  her response to Claypoleโs serious medical need.   \n5    Plaintiffsโ reliance on Conn is misplaced.  In Conn, two police officers were transporting a \n6  woman named Brenda Clustka when she wrapped a seatbelt around her neck while screaming that \n7  the officers should kill her or she would kill herself.  Conn, 591 F.3d at 1092.  The officers handed \n8  Clustka off to jail personnel without reporting the incident, and days later Clustka hanged herself \n9  in a jail cell.  Id.  Finding a triable issue of material fact as to the officersโ subjective awareness of \n10  Clustkaโs serious medical need, the Ninth Circuit held that a reasonable jury could conclude from \n11  the record evidence โthat Clustkaโs medical need was so obvious that [the officers] must have \n12  been subjectively aware of it, despite their later denial of that awareness.โ  Id. at 1097.  The court \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  noted specifically that the officers had not argued that, if they were subjectively aware of \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Clustkaโs serious medical need, they nonetheless responded appropriately.  Conn thus offers no \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  support for Plaintiffsโ challenge to the adequacy of Kayeโs response to Claypoleโs medical need. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16    In support of her motion and in opposition to Plaintiffsโ motion, Kaye submits evidence \nS d nr\nee 17  that she was the shift supervisor responsible for the intake and release area of the Monterey \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  County jail when Claypole arrived on the night of May 1, 2013.  Kaye Dep. 35:23-36:25.  Kaye \n19  was not involved in Claypoleโs intake.  Id. 81:4-15.  At some point after Claypoleโs intake, jail \n20  employee McGregor called Kaye to report that an attorney had informed her that his client had \n21  said he felt like hurting himself.  Id. 79:13-23.  Kayeโs conversation with McGregor was very \n22  short.  Id. 81:16-19.  Kaye does not recall whether McGregor mentioned Claypoleโs name at that \n23  point.  Id. 81:20-23.  Immediately after hanging up with McGregor, Kaye walked out to the \n24  receiving area and stated that the jail needed to put the person McGregor had called about on \n25  suicide watch.  Id. 82:21-83:3.  Kaye ordered that Claypole be placed on suicide watch and stood \n26  by while that occurred.  Id. 83:4-13.  When Claypole was placed in a safety cell, Kaye spoke to \n27  him, explaining that he was being placed on suicide watch based upon his attorneyโs concerns.  Id. \n28  90:13-21.  Kaye or another deputy then advised the jailโs medical staff via radio that someone had \n16 \n\n \n1  been placed in a suicide cell for suicide watch.  Id. 97:20-98:6.  Kaye had no other involvement in \n2  Claypoleโs detention. \n3    Based upon this evidence, no reasonable jury could conclude that Kayeโs response to \n4  Claypoleโs serious medical need was inadequate.     \n5        b.  Resulting Harm \n6    โ[T]o prevail on a ยง 1983 claim under a deliberate indifference theory, plaintiff must prove \n7  that the officialโs actions were both the actual and proximate cause of plaintiffโs injuries.โ  \n8  Clouthier v. Cnty. of Contra Costa, 591 F.3d 1232, 1245 n.3 (9th Cir. 2002) (citing White v. \n9  Roper, 901 F.2d 1501, 1505 (9th Cir. 1990)).   \n10    Plaintiffsโ theory is that had Kaye informed medical staff that she had placed Claypole on \n11  suicide watch because he expressed suicidal ideation, Defendant Fithian would not have removed \n12  Claypole from suicide watch on May 2 and May 4.  Plaintiffs again rely on Conn, in which the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Ninth Circuit held that by failing to pass on information regarding the seatbelt incident, the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  defendant officers foreseeably undermined Clustkaโs access to effective medical evaluations and \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  adequate mental health care.  Conn, 591 F.3d at 1101.  The Ninth Circuit concluded that \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  notwithstanding medical evaluations that occurred between the seatbelt incident and Clustkaโs \nS d nr\nee 17  suicide, a jury could conclude that the officersโ conduct โwas a moving force and proximate cause \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  of Clustkaโs suicide.โ  Id.   \n19    Conn is factually distinct from the present case, in which Kaye placed Claypole on suicide \n20  watch and notified jail medical staff of that fact so that he would be evaluated.7  Plaintiffโs expert, \n21  Dr. Raymond Patterson, testified that he could not conclude based upon his knowledge of the case \n22 \n                                                 \n23 \n7 The Court notes that it did rely on Conn in denying the City of Montereyโs motion for summary \njudgment, concluding that a jury could conclude that the failure of City police officers to pass on \n24 \ninformation regarding Claypoleโs behavior while in their custody could have impaired the medical \nevaluations that foreseeably were performed at the Monterey County jail.  However, the \n25 \ninformation withheld by City officers went well beyond the single third-hand comment upon \nwhich Plaintiffs premise their claims against Kaye.  The City officers personally observed \n26 \nClaypoleโs bizarre behavior, which included numerous comments that arguably could be \ncharacterized as suicidal ideation, over a period of several hours.  Unlike Kaye, the City officers \n27 \ndid not place Claypole on suicide watch or take any action to ensure that he received a mental \nhealth evaluation.  Plaintiffsโ claims against the City officers thus are much closer factually to the \n28 \nclaims against the defendants in Conn. \n17 \n\n \n1  that Kayeโs actions or inactions contributed causally to Claypoleโs suicide.  Patterson Dep. \n2  195:12-15, Exh. J to Grant Decl., ECF 141-2.  \n3    Based upon this record, and even viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, \n4  the Court concludes that Kaye has demonstrated her entitlement to summary judgment and that \n5  Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate the existence of disputed facts from which a reasonable jury \n6  could find that Kayeโs response to Claypoleโs serious medical need was constitutionally \n7  inadequate.  Accordingly, Kayeโs motion for summary judgment on Claims 1 and 2 is \n8  GRANTED.  Plaintiffsโ motion for summary judgment on Claims 1 and 2 is DENIED as to Kaye. \n9    B.  Claim 3 โ Loss of Parent/Child Relationship \n10    The County Defendants and Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on Claim 3, which alleges \n11  Guersenzvaigโs loss of parent/child relationship in violation of the substantive due process clause \n12  of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13    A parent may assert a Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claim if she is \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  deprived of her liberty interest in the companionship of her child through official conduct.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Lemire, 726 F.3d at 1075. โOnly official conduct that shocks the conscience is cognizable as a due \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  process violation.โ  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  โJust as the deliberate \nS d nr\nee 17  indifference of prison officials may support Eighth Amendment liability, such indifference may \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  also rise to the conscience-shocking level required for substantive due process violation.โ  Id. \n19  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  โA prison officialโs deliberately indifferent \n20  conduct will generally shock the conscience so as long as the prison official had time to deliberate \n21  before acting or failing to act in a deliberately indifferent manner.โ  Id. (internal quotation marks \n22  and citation omitted). \n23    Claim 3 is based on the County Defendantsโ alleged deliberate indifference to Claypoleโs \n24  serious medical need and thus, for purposes of the present motions, rises or falls with Claims 1 and \n25  2.  Based upon the foregoing discussion, the County Defendantsโ motion for summary judgment \n26  on Claim 3 is DENIED as to the County and Miller and GRANTED as to Kaye.  Plaintiffsโ motion \n27  for summary judgment on Claim 3 is DENIED. \n28   \n18 \n\n \n1    C.  Claim 5 โ Failure to Summon Medical Care \n2    The County Defendants seek summary judgment on Claim 5, which alleges failure to \n3  summon medical care in violation of California Government Code ยง 845.6.  Plaintiffs do not seek \n4  summary judgment on this claim. \n5    Section 845.6, titled โMedical care for prisoners; failure to obtain,โ provides that โa public \n6  employee, and the public entity where the employee is acting within the scope of his employment, \n7  is liable if the employee knows or has reason to know that the prisoner is in need of immediate \n8  medical care and he fails to take reasonable action to summon such medical care.โ  Cal. Govโt \n9  Code ยง 845.6.  โLiability under section 845.6 is limited to serious and obvious medical conditions \n10  requiring immediate care.โ  Watson v. State of Cal., 21 Cal. App. 4th 836, 841 (1993) (emphasis \n11  added).  The statutory duty does not encompass a duty to provide reasonable medical care.  Id.    \n12    In support of their motion, the County Defendants assert that the record is devoid of \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  evidence that they failed to respond to a situation in which Claypole needed immediate medical \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  care.  Plaintiffs argue that โClaypole was in need of immediate medical care over the 65 hours he \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  was in custody.โ  Pls.โ Opp.  at 23, ECF 148.  However, it is undisputed that Claypole received \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  medical care on numerous occasions during that sixty-five hour period.  Plaintiffs have failed to \nS d nr\nee 17  identify any particular moment in time when Claypole required immediate medical care that was \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  not provided. \n19    When questioned on this point at the hearing, Plaintiffsโ counsel suggested that Claypole \n20  required immediate medical care the moment that Dr. Fithian removed him from suicide watch on \n21  May 4, 2013.  However, counsel did not cite any evidence that Claypole was in immediate distress \n22  at that moment, or any expert opinion or case law suggesting that all inmates released from suicide \n23  watch must be given immediate medical care.  Although it might be inferred that Claypole should \n24  not have been released from suicide watch, such a contention does not support this claim and \n25  rather would go to the reasonableness of Dr. Fithianโs medical determination.  \n26    Based upon an absence of evidence in the record showing that the County Defendants \n27  failed to summon medical care in response to Claypoleโs immediate need for such care, and \n28  Plaintiffsโ failure to identify evidence creating a triable issue of material fact, the County \n19 \n\n \n1  Defendantsโ motion for summary judgment on Claim 5 is GRANTED.     \n2    D.  Claim 6 โ Negligent Supervision, Hiring, Training, and Retention;  \n3      Claim 7 โ Wrongful Death; and Claim 8 โ Negligence   \n4    The County Defendants seek summary judgment on Claim 6, alleging negligent \n5  supervision, hiring, training, and retention; Claim 7, alleging wrongful death; and Claim 8, \n6  alleging negligence.  Plaintiffs do not seek summary judgment on Claims 6 or 7, but they do seek \n7  summary judgment on Claim 8. \n8    With respect to Claim 6, โCalifornia case law recognizes the theory that an employer can \n9  be liable to a third person for negligently hiring, supervising, or retaining an unfit employee.โ  Doe \n10  v. Capital Cities, 50 Cal. App. 1038, 1054 (1996).  โLiability is based upon the facts that the \n11  employer knew or should have known that hiring the employee created a particular risk or hazard \n12  and that particular harm materializes.โ  Id.  With respect to Claim 7, the elements of a wrongful \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  death claim are:  (1) a wrongful act or neglect that (2) causes (3) the death of another person.  See \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Cal. Civ. P. Code ยง 377.60; Norgart v. Upjohn Co., 21 Cal. 4th 383, 390 (1999).  Plaintiffsโ brief \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  indicates that their wrongful death claim is based upon negligence.  Pls.โ Br. at 24, ECF 148.  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Finally, with respect to Claim 8, the elements of a negligence claim are a duty owed by the \nS d nr\nee 17  defendant, breach of that duty, and resulting harm to the plaintiff.  Raven H. v. Gamette, 157 Cal. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  App. 4th 1017, 1024-25 (2007).   \n19    In support of her motion, Kaye points to an absence of evidence in the record that she \n20  breached any of the above duties to Claypole or otherwise acted wrongfully.  Plaintiffsโ claims \n21  against Kaye are based solely on her failure to relay to medical staff the suicidal comment reported \n22  by Claypoleโs attorney on the night of his intake into the jail.  It is undisputed that upon being \n23  informed of that comment Kaye immediately directed that Claypole be placed on suicide watch \n24  and informed medical staff of that fact.  When the nonmoving party has the burden of proof at \n25  trial, the moving party may meet its burden on summary judgment by demonstrating an absence of \n26  evidence in the record to support the nonmoving partyโs case.  In re Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., 627 \n27  F.3d at 387.  Accordingly, Kaye has met her initial burden. \n28    Although they oppose Kayeโs motion and move for summary judgment against Kaye on \n20 \n\n \n1  Claim 8, Plaintiffs do not explain how Kayeโs failure to tell medical staff about the comment \n2  reported by Claypoleโs attorney caused any harm to Claypole.  Plaintiffsโ own expert, Dr. \n3  Patterson, testified that he could not conclude based upon his knowledge of the case that Kayeโs \n4  actions or inactions contributed to Claypoleโs suicide.  Patterson Dep. 195:12-15, Exh. J to Grant \n5  Decl., ECF 141-2.  Plaintiffs thus have failed to demonstrate the existence of disputed facts that \n6  would preclude summary judgment for Kaye on these claims. \n7    With respect to the County and Miller, Defendantsโ motion does not address the elements \n8  of Plaintiffsโ state law claims.  Defendants argue Claim 6 as though it were a claim for deliberate \n9  indifference rather than a state common law claim.  See Cnty. Defs.โ Mot. at 19-24, ECF 141.  For \n10  example, they cite Farmer, Gibson, and other cases addressing theories of negligent supervision, \n11  hiring, training, and retention in the deliberate indifference context.  The County and Miller \n12  address Claims 7 and 8 only in general terms, asserting that they did not know or suspect that \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Claypole might commit suicide and that they acted appropriately throughout his detention.  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Defendants do not address Plaintiffsโ theory that they acted negligently in placing Claypole โ an \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  individual with mental health issues who had just been discharged from suicide watch โ in a \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  lockdown cell containing suicide hazards.   Thus the County and Miller have not carried their \nS d nr\nee 17  initial burden as to these claims.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18    Plaintiffs do address the elements of their negligence claim, as to which Plaintiffs seek \n19  summary judgment, arguing that the County and Miller had a duty of care with respect to housing \n20  and providing mental health treatment to Claypole.  Plaintiffs argue that Defendants breached that \n21  duty by placing Claypole in an environment with known suicide risks.  However, as discussed \n22  above, there are disputed factual issues as to whether the County and Miller were aware that the \n23  policy of housing inmates with mental health issues in A-pod and B-pod upon release from suicide \n24  watch posed a substantial risk of harm.  See Thornburg Decl. ยถยถ 3-5, ECF 149-2.  In addition, \n25  there are disputed issues as to whether the Countyโs policies met the standard of care.  See Bryce \n26  Report at 1, Exh. L to Grant Decl., ECF 141-2.   Those disputed issues preclude summary \n27  judgment for Plaintiffs on their negligence claim. \n28    The County Defendantsโ motion for summary judgment on Claims 6-8 is GRANTED as to \n21 \n\n \n1  Kaye and DENIED as to the County and Miller.  Plaintiffsโ motion for summary judgment on \n2  Claim 8 is DENIED. \n3    IV.  CROSS-MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT RE DR. FITHIAN AND CFMG \n4    Plaintiffs assert claims against Dr. Fithian and CFMG for deliberate indifference to serious \n5  medical needs in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment (Claims 1 and 2); deprivation of \n6  parent/child relationship in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments (Claim 3); medical \n7  malpractice under California law (Claim 4); failure to summon medical care in violation of \n8  California Government Code ยง 845.6 (Claim 5); negligent supervision, training, hiring, and \n9  retention under California law (Claim 6); and wrongful death under California Civil Procedure \n10  Code ยง 377.60 (Claim 7).  Fithian and CFMG seek summary judgment on Claims 1-3 and 5, while \n11  Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on Claims 1-4 and 7.  Plaintiffs also purport to seek summary \n12  judgment on Claim 8, alleging negligence.  See Pls.โ Opp. & Mot. at 34-35, ECF 142.  However, \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Plaintiffsโ operative first amended complaint does not name Fithian and CFMG as defendants to \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Claim 8.  FAC ยถยถ 125-30.     \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15    A.  Claims 1 and 2 โ Deliberate Indifference \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16    Plaintiffs and the Medical Defendants seek summary judgment on Claims 1 and 2, which \nS d nr\nee 17  assert deliberate indifference to Claypoleโs serious medical needs in violation of the Fourteenth \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Amendment. \n19      1.  Dr. Fithian \n20    Private physicians employed to provide medical care to inmates are state actors for \n21  purposes of ยง 1983.  See West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 54-55 (1988).  In order to make out a \n22  deliberate indifference claim against Fithian, Plaintiffs must show that Claypole had a serious \n23  medical need, Fithianโs deliberate indifference, and resulting harm.  See Conn, 591 F.3d at 1095.  \n24  To demonstrate that Fithian was deliberately indifferent to Claypoleโs serious medical need, \n25  Plaintiffs must show that he was โ(a) subjectively aware of the serious medical need and (b) failed \n26  to adequately respond.โ  Id. at 1096 (citing Farmer, 511 U.S. at 838 (1994)).  In order to be \n27  subjectively aware of a serious medical need, an official โmust both be aware of facts from which \n28  the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw \n22 \n\n \n1  the inference.โ  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837 (emphasis added).   \n2    In support of their own motion and in opposition to Fithianโs motion, Plaintiffs point to the \n3  undisputed facts that Fithian knew Claypole had been placed on suicide watch the night of May 1, \n4  2013; removed from suicide watch (by Fithian) on May 2, 2013; and placed back on suicide watch \n5  on May 3, 2013.  See Fithian Decl. ยถยถ 2-6, ECF 152-4.  The second suicide watch was based on \n6  Spanoโs telephone call to Fithian on the afternoon of May 3.  Spano reported that Claypole was \n7  acting strange and had stated that he wanted to kill himself.  Id. ยถ 6.  Based on Spanoโs report, \n8  Fithian agreed that Claypole should return to a safety cell.  Id.  Yet early the following morning \n9  Fithian ordered Claypole released from suicide watch.  Fithian had some additional information on \n10  Saturday morning that he did not have on Friday afternoon when he spoke to Spano.  Specifically, \n11  Fithian knew that Claypole had received two additional doses of Klonopin since seeing Spano, \n12  was calm, was requesting release from the safety cell, and was denying any suicidal ideation.  Id. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  at ยถ 8.   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    Plaintiffs also cite the testimony of the Medical Defendantsโ expert, Dr. Hayward, that \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  when attempting to determine a patientโs suicide risk, experienced doctors know not to ask about \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  suicidal ideation directly, because if the patient is contemplating suicide he or she will not want to \nS d nr\nee 17  disclose that information.  Hayward Dep. 102:1-104:16, ECF 143-10.   Fithian himself testified \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  that someone in a mental health crisis can have periods of suicidal thoughts and nonsuicidal \n19  thoughts during the same day.  Fithian Dep. 95:15-18, ECF 143-10. \n20    Plaintiffs additionally present Fithianโs testimony that he has authored training materials \n21  indicating that a white, twenty year old male held in pretrial detention is in a very high risk \n22  category for suicide.  Fithian Dep. 218:2-14, ECF 143-10.  Fithian testified that it is generally \n23  understood by forensic mental health experts that segregated or isolated conditions such those in a \n24  lockdown cell can increase suicide risk, and that he held that opinion in 2013.  Id. 83:20-86:11.  \n25  He also testified that it is generally understood in forensic mental health that the first seventy-two \n26  hours of incarceration are a time of increased suicide risk.  Id. 86:17-20.  According to Fithian, \n27  ninety percent of suicides in county jails throughout the country are accomplished by hanging.  Id. \n28  48:22-24.   Fithian was aware of prior hangings at in the lockdown units at the County jail.  Id. \n23 \n\n \n1  50:2021, 62:6-20, 72:0-74:17.    \n2    In support of his motion and in opposition to Plaintiffsโ motion, Fithian argues that the \n3  record is devoid of evidence that he actually drew an inference that releasing Claypole from \n4  suicide watch on May 4, 2013 gave rise to a substantial risk of harm.8  Fithian submits his own \n5  declaration statement that, in his opinion, Claypole was not acutely suicidal when released from \n6  suicide watch on May 4, 2013.  Fithian Decl. ยถ 9, ECF 152-4. \n7    The Ninth Circuit has held that summary judgment on a deliberate indifference claim \n8  cannot be supported โsimply on the basis of the defendantsโ assertions as to their own state of \n9  mind.โ  Conn, 591 F.3d at 1097.  In Conn, the Ninth Circuit reversed the district courtโs grant of \n10  summary judgment for the defendant officers, holding that the officersโ testimony that they did not \n11  subjectively believe Clustka to be a suicide risk was insufficient to establish their entitlement to \n12  judgment.  The court explained that โ[p]roof of โsubjective awarenessโ is not limited to the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  purported recollections of the individuals involved.โ  Conn, 591 F.3d at 1097.  Instead, the court \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  stated, โ[w]hether [an] official had the requisite knowledge of a substantial risk is a question of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  fact subject to demonstration in the usual ways, including inference from circumstantial evidence.โ  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Id. (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842).  The court determined that a reasonable jury could \nS d nr\nee 17  conclude from the record evidence โthat Clustkaโs medical need was so obvious that [the officers] \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  must have been subjectively aware of it, despite their later denial of that awareness.โ  Id.   \n19    As in Conn, a jury confronted with the present record could accept Dr. Fithianโs statements \n20  that he did not subjectively believe that Claypole was at substantial risk of harm if released from \n21  suicide watch and sent back to A-pod.  However, a jury alternatively could find that Claypoleโs \n22  risk of suicide was so obvious that Fithian must have been subjectively aware of it despite his \n23  protestations to the contrary.  โ[Q]uestions involving a personโs state of mind are generally factual \n24  issues inappropriate for resolution by summary judgment.โ  Conn at 1098 (internal quotation \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n8 The Court notes that Plaintiffs argue that the treatment provided by Fithian and CFMG fell \nbelow the standard of care and that Fithian and CFMG knew or should have known that Claypole \n27 \nwas at risk when he was discharged from suicide watch on the morning of May 4, 2013.  \nHowever, Plaintiffsโ deliberate indifference claims require a showing that Fithian actually drew \n28 \nthe inference that Claypole was at substantial risk of serious harm.    \n24 \n\n \n1  marks and citation omitted).  Because a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether Fithian \n2  was subjectively aware that Claypole was at substantial risk of harm if released from suicide \n3  watch on May 4, 2013, the partiesโ cross-motions for summary judgment on Claims 1 and 2 are \n4  DENIED as to Fithian.9 \n5      2.  CFMG \n6    Courts have treated medical groups employed to provide prison medical services as local \n7  government entities for purposes of deliberate indifference claims.  See Carrea v. California, No. \n8  EDCV 07-1148-CAS (MAN), 2009 WL 1770130, at *8 & n.5 (C.D. Cal. June 18, 2009) \n9  (collecting cases).  CFMG concedes that it may be sued under ยง 1983 and that Monell principles \n10  apply to such claims.  \n11    As discussed above with respect to Plaintiffsโ claims against the County, a plaintiff may \n12  recover against a local government for deliberate indifference under one of three theories of \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  liability.  See Clouthier, 591 F.3d at 1249.  โFirst, a local government may be held liable โwhen \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  implementation of its official policies or established customs inflicts the constitutional injury.โโ  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Id. (quoting Monell, 436 U.S. at 708 (Powell, J. concurring)).  โSecond, under certain \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  circumstances, a local government may be held liable under ยง 1983 for acts of โomission,โ when \nS d nr\nee 17  such omissions amount to the local governmentโs own official policy.โ  Id.  โThird, a local \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  government may be held liable under ยง 1983 when the individual who committed the \n19  constitutional tort was an official with final policy-making authority or such an official ratified a \n20  subordinateโs unconstitutional decision or action and the basis for it.โ  Id. at 1250 (internal \n21  quotation marks and citation omitted).   \n22    Plaintiffs appear to be asserting liability against CFMG based upon its asserted de facto \n23  policy of sending inmates with mental illness to A-pod or B-pod upon release from suicide watch.  \n24  Plaintiffs also appear to be asserting that CFMG is liable for the acts of its policy maker, Fithian.   \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n9 Fithian does not argue that, if Claypole was at substantial risk of harm on the morning of May 4, \n2013, Fithian responded adequately by discharging Claypole from suicide watch knowing that he \n27 \nwould go back to A-pod. \n   \n28 \n \n25 \n\n \n1        a.  Policy \n2    Plaintiffs present the following evidence in support of their own motion and in opposition \n3  to CFMGโs motion.  They present the opinions of their expert, Dr. Patterson, that Claypoleโs \n4  medical treatment fell below the professional standard of care and that his suicide likely was \n5  foreseeable under the circumstances.  Patterson Report at 191-94, Exh. 117 to Rifkin Decl., ECF \n6  143-9.  While Dr. Patterson does not opine as to the constitutionality of CFMGโs policies, he does \n7  opine that Claypoleโs placement in a lockdown unit was inappropriate and contributed to his \n8  suicide.  Id.  Dr. Pattersonโs opinions could give rise to a reasonable inference that a policy of \n9  transitioning individuals from safety cells directly to lockdown cells without other attendant \n10  precautions amounts to deliberate indifference.10 \n11    In opposition to Plaintiffsโ motion and in support of its own motion, CFMG presents the \n12  opinion of its expert, Dr. Hayward, that CFMGโs policies meet minimal professional standards of \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  care and constitutional standards.  See Hayward Report at 11, Exh. B to Bertling Decl., ECF 125; \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Hayward Dep. 54:13-55:19.  Another of CFMGโs experts, Dr. Jason Roof, also opines that \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  CFMGโs policies meet professional standards of care and constitutional standards, and that the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  care rendered to Claypole was appropriate and within the standard of care.  Roof Report at 17, \nS d nr\nee 17  Exh. B to Bertling Decl., ECF 125.  CFMG also relies upon CFMGโs written Policy and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Procedure Manual, which incorporates in its Suicide Prevention section Monterey Countyโs \n19  written plan for the prevention of suicide.  The plan specifies that an individual who shows \n20  potential risk of suicide must be referred to medical staff for assessment.  Fithian states in his \n21  declaration that in May 2013, he could have directed that an individual released from suicide \n22  watch be housed in โa variety of step down units.โ11  Fithian Decl. ยถ 11, ECF 152-4.  \n23 \n                                                 \n10 The Medical Defendants assert that Dr. Patterson โhas begrudgingly testified CFMGโs suicide \n24 \nprevention program met constitutional standards.โ  Defs.โ Mot. at 6, ECF 124-1.  In support for \nthat assertion, Defendants cite to Dr. Pattersonโs report in its entirety and to a page of Dr. \n25 \nPattersonโs deposition that does not support the assertion.  While Dr. Patterson has not opined \nspecifically as to the ultimate question of whether CFMGโs policies are constitutionally deficient, \n26 \nhe has provided expert opinion that may be relied upon by a jury in making that determination. \n \n27 \n11 Commander Bass, the Countyโs Rule 30(b)(6) witness, testified that the jail does not have any \nkind of step down cells or transition cells between a safety cell and a regular housing cell.  Bass \n28 \nDep. 103:17-21, Exh. Vol. 3 to Rifkin Decl., ECF 147-5. \n26 \n\n \n1    The partiesโ evidence creates a triable issue of fact as to whether CFMGโs policies were \n2  constitutionally inadequate.     \n3        b.  Acts of Dr. Fithian  \n4    There is no dispute that Dr. Fithian has final policy-making authority with respect to \n5  CFMG.  As discussed above, Fithianโs deposition testimony and declaration statements create a \n6  triable issue as to whether Fithian knew that transitioning individuals from safety cells to \n7  lockdown cells creates a substantial risk of harm.  To the extent that he may be liable for \n8  deliberate indifference, CFMG may be liable as well.   \n9    Accordingly, the partiesโ cross-motions for summary judgment on Claims 1 and 2 are \n10  DENIED as to CFMG. \n11    B.  Claim 3 โ Loss of Parent/Child Relationship \n12    Plaintiffs and the Medical Defendants seek summary judgment on Claim 3 for loss of \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  parent/child relationship.  As noted above, parents may assert a Fourteenth Amendment \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  substantive due process claim if they are deprived of their liberty interest in the companionship of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  their child through official conduct.  Lemire, 726 F.3d at 1075. โOnly official conduct that shocks \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  the conscience is cognizable as a due process violation.โ  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation \nS d nr\nee 17  omitted).  โA prison officialโs deliberately indifferent conduct will generally shock the conscience \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  so as long as the prison official had time to deliberate before acting or failing to act in a \n19  deliberately indifferent manner.โ  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).   \n20    Claim 3 is based on the Medical Defendantsโ alleged deliberate indifference to Claypoleโs \n21  serious medical needs and thus, for purposes of the present motions, rises or falls with Claims 1 \n22  and 2.  Based upon the foregoing discussion, the partiesโ cross-motions for summary judgment on \n23  Claim 3 are DENIED. \n24    C.  Claim 4 โ Medical Malpractice \n25    Only Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on Claim 4, alleging medical malpractice.  Fithian \n26  and CFMG do not seek summary judgment on this claim.   \n27 \n                                                                                                                                                                \n28 \n \n27 \n\n \n1    โThe elements of a cause of action for medical malpractice are:  (1) a duty to use such \n2  skill, prudence, and diligence as other members of the profession commonly possess and exercise; \n3  (2) a breach of the duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the \n4  injury; and (4) resulting loss or damage.โ  Chakalis v. Elevator Solutions, Inc., 205 Cal. App. 4th \n5  1557, 1571 (2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).   \n6    In support of their motion, Plaintiffs present the opinion of their expert that the medical \n7  treatment provided to Claypole fell below the standard of care.  See Patterson Report at 7, Exh. \n8  117 to Rifkin Decl., ECF 143-9.  This evidence is sufficient to meet Plaintiffsโ initial burden.  \n9  However, in opposition to the motion, the Medical Defendants present expert opinion that the \n10  medical treatment provided to Claypole met the standard of care.  See Hayward Report at 16, Exh. \n11  B to Bertling Decl., ECF 125; Roof Report at 17, Exh. B to Bertling Decl., ECF 125.  Given these \n12  competing expert opinions, a triable issue of material fact exists as to the question of breach of the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  duty of care. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    Plaintiffsโ motion for summary judgment on Claim 4 is DENIED. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15    D.  Claim 5 โ Failure to Summon Medical Care \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16    Fithian and CFMG seek summary judgment on Claim 5 for failure to summon medical \nS d nr\nee 17  care.  Plaintiffs do not seek summary judgment on this claim.   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18    As discussed above, California Government Code ยง 845.6 provides that a public employee \n19  may be liable for failure to respond to a prisonerโs need for immediate medical care.  Cal. Govโt \n20  Code ยง 845.6; Watson, 21 Cal. App. 4th at 841.  Plaintiffs have not identified a moment when \n21  Fithian and CFMG failed to respond to Claypoleโs need for immediate medical care.  Moreover, it \n22  simply makes no sense for Plaintiffs to assert liability against the Medical Defendants for failing \n23  to summon themselves.  Plaintiffs have submitted no evidence to support the need to summon an \n24  ambulance or other emergency medical service. \n25    The Medical Defendantsโ motion for summary judgment on Claim 5 is GRANTED.    \n26    E.  Claim 7 โ Wrongful Death \n27    Only Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on Claim 7, for wrongful death.  Fithian and \n28  CFMG do not seek judgment on this claim.    \n28 \n\n \n1    The elements of a wrongful death claim are:  (1) a wrongful act or neglect that (2) causes \n2  (3) the death of another person.  See Cal. Civ. P. Code ยง 377.60; Norgart, 21 Cal. 4th at 390.  In \n3  support of their motion, Plaintiffs submit their expertโs opinion that the medical treatment \n4  provided to Claypole fell below the standard of care.  See Pls.โ Br. at 34, ECF 142.  This evidence \n5  is sufficient to meet Plaintiffsโ initial burden.  However, Fithian and CFMG have submitted \n6  conflicting expert opinions stating that the medical treatment provided to Claypole met the \n7  standard of care.  See Hayward Report at 16, Exh. B to Bertling Decl., ECF 125; Roof Report at \n8  17, Exh. B to Bertling Decl., ECF 125.  Thus a triable issue of material fact exists as to an \n9  essential element of Plaintiffsโ wrongful death claim. \n10    Plaintiffsโ motion for summary judgment on Claim 7 is DENIED. \n11    V.  ORDER \n12    For the foregoing reasons, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13    (1)  The County Defendantsโ motion is GRANTED IN PART as to all claims asserted  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14      against Kaye and as to Claim 5 and otherwise is DENIED, and Plaintiffsโ cross- \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15      motion against the County Defendants is DENIED; and \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16    (2)  The Medical Defendantsโ motion is GRANTED IN PART as to Claim 5 and  \nS d nr\nee 17      otherwise is DENIED, and Plaintiffsโ cross-motion against the Medical    \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18      Defendants is DENIED. \n19   \n20  Dated:   February 22, 2016 \n21                     ______________________________________ \nBETH LABSON FREEMAN \n22  United States District Judge \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 ",

On May 4, 2013, 20-year-old Joshua Claypole committed suicide in a \n3  cell at Monterey County Jail by hanging himself from a bed sheet. Three days prior, \n4  Claypole had been arrested for the fatal stabbing of Daniel Garcia Huerta, a taxi \n5  driver, during a bipolar episode. These two tragic deaths should not have \n6  happenedโand would not have happenedโif Defendants in this case had fulfilled \n7  their duties as public safety agencies and followed policies and procedures that are \n8  standard in their fields and required by law.   \n9  2.  Defendants are California municipalities, Sheriffsโ departments, health \n10  care providers, and their employees. Each Defendant entity had multiple contacts \n11  with Claypole in the days before his death. Had Defendants followed standard \n12  protocols and training, they would have identified Claypoleโs acute mental health \n13  crisis and risk factors, and intervened to protect him and the public. However, \n14  Defendants did not have the appropriate policies and procedures in place, and \n15  ignored the obvious warning signs.  As a result, two families lost their loved ones.  \n16  3.  The Estate of Joshua Claypole and Claypoleโs mother, Silvia \n17  Guersenzvaig, bring this action for damages against Defendants for violations \n18  arising out of Defendantsโ deliberate indifference and negligence that caused the \n19  needless suffering and death of Joshua Claypole.  \n20  JURISDICTION \n21  4.  This Complaint seeks damages for violations of the civil rights, \n22  privileges, and immunities guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of \n23  the United States Constitution, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983 and 1988, and for \n24  violations of California state law.   \n25  5.  This Court has jurisdiction over this lawsuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง \n26  1331 and 1343. \n27  6.  This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims \n28  asserted herein pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367, because the claims form part of the \n   \n-1- \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page3 of 227\n \n1  same case or controversy arising under the United States Constitution and federal \n2  law. \n3  VENUE \n4  7.  Plaintiffsโ claims arose in the Counties of San Mateo and Monterey, \n5  California. Venue therefore lies in the Northern District of California pursuant to 28 \n6  U.S.C. ยง 1391(b)(2). \n7  8.  Rule 3 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rule 3-2(e) \n8  authorizes assignment to this division because a substantial part of the events or \n9  omissions giving rise to Plaintiffsโ claims occurred in the counties served by this \n10  division. \n11  PARTIES \n12  9.  Plaintiff Silvia Guersenzvaig, as Administrator of the Estate of Joshua \n13  Kannon Claypole, brings this action pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure \n14  ยงยง 377.10 et seq. At the time of his death, Joshua Claypole was a 20-year-old \n15  citizen of the United States and resident of the County of Monterey in the State of \n16  California. The survival causes of action in this matter are based on violations of \n17  Joshua Claypoleโs rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and on \n18  violations of California state law. \n19  10.  Silvia Guersenzvaig is the mother of Joshua Claypole. She is suing \n20  individually for violations of civil rights under the First and Fourteenth \n21  Amendments and California state law. \n22  11.

Monterey County Sheriffโs Department operates Monterey County \n23  Jail, and is and was responsible for ensuring the provision of emergency and \n24  medical and mental health care services to all Monterey County Jail inmates. \n25  14.  Defendant Scott Miller is, and was at all relevant times mentioned \n26  herein, the Sheriff of the County of Monterey, the highest position in the San Mateo \n27  County Sheriffโs Department. As Sheriff, Defendant Miller is and was responsible \n28  for the hiring, screening, training, retention, supervision, discipline, counseling, and \n   \n-3- \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page5 of 227\n \n1  control of all San Mateo Sheriffโs Department custodial employees and/or agents \n2  and Does 11 through 20.

Defendant Miller is being sued in his individual and \n8  official capacities. \n9  15.  Defendant E. Kaye is, and was at all relevant times mentioned herein, \n10  a Sergeant in the County of Montereyโs Sheriffโs Department. As a Sergeant, \n11  Defendant Kaye is a supervisor at the Monterey County Jail. On May 1, 2013, \n12  Defendant Kaye was the on-duty Sergeant at the Monterey County Jail who \n13  received notice from a subordinate deputy that Joshua Claypole was suicidal. She \n14  had direct control over the placement of Claypole in a safety cell, and for ensuring \n15  he was placed on suicide watch during his detention at Monterey County Jail. Her \n16  failure to ensure adequate protection and monitoring of Claypole led to his suicide.  \n17  Defendant Kaye is being sued in her individual capacity. \n18  16.  Defendant City of Monterey is a municipality duly organized and \n19  existing under the laws of the State of California. The Monterey Police Department \n20  is a duly formed agency of the City of Monterey. Under its authority, Defendant \n21  City of Monterey is and was at all relevant times mentioned herein responsible for \n22  the actions and/or inactions and the policies, procedures, and practices/customs of \n23  the Monterey Police Department and its respective employees and/or agents.

Defendant California Forensic Medical Group (โCFMGโ) is a \n15  California corporation headquartered in Monterey, California. CFMG is a private \n16  correctional health care provider that services approximately 65 correctional \n17  facilities in 27 California counties. The County of Monterey contracts with CFMG \n18  to provide medical, mental health, and dental services for the Monterey County Jail. \n19  At all relevant times mentioned herein, CFMG was responsible for the health \n20  services provided to Joshua Claypole during his detention in the Monterey County \n21  Jail. \n22  20.

Plaintiffs filed governmental tort claims with the State and Defendant \n17  County of Monterey, including on behalf of the Estate of Joshua Claypole, on \n18  October 28, 2013.  By correspondence dated December 13, 2013, the County of \n19  Monterey rejected the governmental tort claims on behalf of Joshua Claypole. \n20  29.  By correspondence dated March 10, 2014, Plaintiffs notified \n21  Defendants County of Monterey, Sheriff Miller, CFMG, and Dr. Taylor Fithian of \n22  their intention to file suit against them based on their negligence in providing \n23  professional health care services, as required by Section 364 of the California Code \n24  of Civil Procedure.  \n25  /// \n26  /// \n27   \n   \n28 \n   \n-8- \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page10 of 227\n \n1  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  \n2  I.  History of Inadequate Mental Health Care in Monterey County Jail \n3  30.  County of Monterey and CFMG have been on notice that their \n4  provision of mental health care to inmates at the Monterey County Jail is \n5  inadequate and results in needless harm since at least 2007, when the Monterey \n6  County Sheriffโs Office and the Monterey County Board of Supervisors hired an \n7  outside consulting firm to perform a needs assessment for the Jail.  \n8  31.  The independent assessment was updated in 2011 and found County of \n9  Monterey and CFMGโs policies and practices for screening, supervising, and \n10  treating prisoners at risk for suicide inadequate. (See Exhibit 1.) The 2011 \n11  Assessment identified structural and design flaws of cells and dormitories that do \n12  not minimize suicide hazards in the facilities and fail to prevent self-harm. (See \n13  Exhibit 1 at EX.3.)  The Assessment also found that Monterey County Jailโs \n14  physical facilities lack sufficient treatment space and therefore prevent adequate \n15  delivery of medical and mental health care. (Exhibit 1 at EX.3, A.3.) \n16  32.  In addition to the Jailโs structural issues the Assessment found that \n17  chronic understaffing hinders County of Montereyโs ability to provide medical care, \n18  classify and move inmates within the facility, maintain inmate safety and security, \n19  and transport inmates to and from outside agencies. (Exhibit 1 at G.1โG.3, J.2โJ.3.) \n20  In addition, understaffing and overcrowding at the Jail creates what the Assessment \n21  called โan indirect supervision facility,โ which impairs the Jailโs ability to \n22  โrecognize, manage and treatโ mental health issues among the inmate population \n23  (as opposed to direct supervision from experienced physicians and psychologists). \n24  (Id. at EX.3.) \n25  33.  These deficiencies are even more troubling in light of the \n26  Assessmentโs finding that approximately 15โ20% of the Jailโs inmates suffer from \n27  mental health issues. (Exhibit 1 at A.3 n. 4.) \n28  /// \n   \n-9- \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page11 of 227\n \n1  34.  The Assessmentโs findings were confirmed in a 2013 draft report by an \n2  expert hired by County of Monterey, Dr. Richard Hayward (โHayward Reportโ).  \n3  (See Exhibit 2.) The County tasked Dr. Hayward with evaluating mental health care \n4  at Monterey County Jail in response to a federal class action lawsuit challenging \n5  County of Montereyโs provision of medical and mental health care at the Jail. See \n6  Hernandez v. Cnty. of Monterey, No. 13-cv-2354-PSG (N.D. Cal. filed May 23, \n7  2013). The Hayward Report, dated December 6, 2013, affirmed that understaffing \n8  of mental health professionals led to inadequate mental health care for inmates (see \n9  Exhibit 2 at 5), compounding the 2011 Assessmentโs findings of problems \n10  associated with crowded and space-limited clinics at the Jail. \n11  35.  In addition, the Hayward Report identified other serious deficiencies in \n12  the delivery of mental health care at the Monterey County Jail, including: \n13  a.  Lack of a complete mental health screening process that leads to \n14  inadequate identification of arrestees with a potential for self-harm or a history of \n15  mental disorders. (Exhibit 2 at 2.) \n16  b.  Lack of mental health questions on intake forms that could \n17  adequately log an inmateโs symptoms and treatment history, prior providers, past \n18  diagnoses and medications, and history of self-harm. (Exhibit 2 at 4.) \n19  c.  County of Monterey employs only a total of four mental health \n20  professionals, which the Hayward Report concluded was โinsufficient to meet the \n21  mental health needs of the inmates.โ (Exhibit 2 at 5.)  \n22  d.  Lack of mental health care clinicians assigned to the jail on \n23  weekends โresults in insufficient services to mentally ill inmates,โ relevant because \n24  Claypole committed suicide on a Saturday. (Exhibit 2 at 2.) \n25  e.  Inadequate supervision of inmates placed on suicide watch in \n26  designated โSafety Cells,โ including delays of up to an hour or more between \n27  checks of designated inmates who should be monitored twice each thirty minutes. \n28  (Exhibit 2 at 12.) \n   \n-10- \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page12 of 227\n \n1  36.  County of Montereyโs failures to timely identify, adequately treat, or \n2  effectively monitor prisoners at risk for suicide have had tragic consequences. \n3  According to the allegations contained in the Hernandez v. County of Monterey \n4  complaint, there had been three completed and over a dozen attempted suicides in \n5  the four years prior to Claypoleโs suicide. According to that complaint, the rate of \n6  completed suicides at the Monterey County Jail is nearly twice the national average \n7  for jail facilities.  \n8  37.  Moreover, on April 15, 2013, prior to Joshua Claypoleโs death, County \n9  of Monterey was again specifically put on notice of the serious problems with \n10  mental health treatment in the jail, as well as its disproportionately high suicide \n11  rate, in a letter written by Hernandez class counsel. (See Exhibit 3.)  \n12  II.  Joshua Claypoleโs Detentions and Suicide \n13  A.  Claypoleโs Mental Health History \n14  38.  Joshua Claypole was born in Monterey, California, and was raised \n15  primarily in Big Sur, California, by his mother Silvia Guersenzvaig.  \n16  39.  Starting in or around his junior year in high school, Claypole began \n17  struggling with substance abuse and exhibiting symptoms of mental illness, \n18  including anxiety, panic disorders, and bipolar disorder. He eventually dropped out \n19  of high school in December of his senior year.  \n20  40.  Guersenzvaig sought help for Claypole from numerous mental health \n21  therapists and practitioners from approximately 2010 through 2013.  \n22  41.  During this period, Claypole was treated by at least one psychiatrist at \n23  CHOMP, Dr. Marshal Alan Blatt. Dr. Blatt worked with Claypole between March \n24  2012 and August 2012, but abruptly terminated his relationship with Claypole with \n25  no follow up care or referral to another care provider. \n26  42.  In this time, Claypole would fluctuate between normative behavior and \n27  his more agitated, disturbed periods. When on his prescribed medications, he was \n28  funny, loving, creative, and thoughtful, often talking openly about his growth as a \n   \n-11- \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page13 of 227\n \n1  young adult and the lessons he learned from his past experience and from others. \n2  During periods of instability, however, he struggled with anxiety, aggression, and \n3  substance abuse. This behavior led to two arrests, one for a DUI and vandalism and \n4  the other for minor possession of cocaine. As part of his sentences for these arrests, \n5  Claypole successfully completed several rehabilitation programs. \n6  B.  First Detention in San Mateo County \n7  43.  Joshua Claypoleโs mental health issues came to a head in April 2013. \n8  On April 24, Silvia Guersenzvaig scheduled Claypole to see his treating \n9  psychiatrist, Dr. John R. Donaldson, on May 2. By approximately April 27, \n10  Claypole stopped sleeping, believed he had telepathy, and thought that others were \n11  communicating to him through their thoughts.  \n12  44.  Five days before the May 2 appointment with his psychiatrist, Joshua \n13  Claypole experienced a psychotic episode.  On April 28, 2013, while at his \n14  motherโs home, Claypole began acting strangely, exhibited aggressive and paranoid \n15  behavior, and left the home without telling Guersenzvaig where he was going.  \n16  45.  Claypole traveled to the home of friends that evening, but did not sleep \n17  the entire night. During the night, he told them he thought the singer of the music \n18  they were listening to was going to come out of the music to kill him.  \n19  46.  The next day, Claypole returned to his motherโs home, collected his \n20  belongings, and left without answering her questions about where he was going. He \n21  appeared agitated and paranoid.  \n22  47.  Worrying about her sonโs health, Silvia Guersenzvaig called Joshua \n23  Claypoleโs psychiatrist Dr. Donaldson on April 29 and spoke with his office staff \n24  about Claypoleโs behavior. She asked Dr. Donaldsonโs staff to provide further \n25  assistance to Claypole in his upcoming May 2 appointment.  \n26  48.  Guersenzvaig called Dr. Donaldsonโs office again on April 30, 2013, \n27  to confirm that Claypole would be receiving assistance and treatment from Dr. \n28  Donaldson at his appointment in two days.    \n   \n-12- \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page14 of 227\n \n1  49.  After leaving his motherโs home on April 29, records reflect that \n2  Joshua Claypole was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence at 1:00 \n3  a.m. on the morning of April 30, 2013, by California Highway Patrol officers in \n4  Redwood City, California. According to San Mateo Sheriffโs Department records, \n5  he was booked and detained at the Maguire Correctional Facility operated by \n6  County of San Mateo at approximately 4:30 a.m., and his car was impounded. A \n7  jail property slip indicates that he was arrested with medication in his possession, \n8  among other items.  \n9  50.  California Highway Patrol records indicate that CHP officers \n10  performed a narcotics test on Claypole, but San Mateo records do not reflect any \n11  review by San Mateo personnel of the test or its results.   \n12  51.  Although the San Mateo Arrest Report/Booking Sheet for Claypole \n13  noted that he was under the influence and his speech was slow and slurred, and the \n14  San Mateo Correctional Health Services Intake Sheet notes that his arrest was \n15  primarily for drug intoxication, San Mateo staffโs medical examination of Claypole \n16  checked โnoโ for โany signs of alcohol/drug intoxication and/or withdrawalโ and \n17  failed to check the box noting slurred speech.  \n18  52.  San Mateoโs medical records also indicate that Claypole reported his \n19  psychiatric history and prescriptions for medications including Adderall (prescribed \n20  primarily for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and Klonopin (prescribed to \n21  treat anxiety disorders, panic disorders, and psychosis) to the screening nurse at \n22  Maguire Correctional Facility. Adderall and Klonopin are known to have side \n23  effects including irritability and aggression, cognitive impairments and \n24  hallucinations, depression, suicidal thoughts, and mood swings.  According to San \n25  Mateoโs medical records, staff then prescribed Claypole three psychotropic \n26  medications: Hydroxyzine, Quetiapine, and Lithium Carbonate. All three \n27  medications are used to treat bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, psychosis, and mania. \n28  However, no referral for further medical health monitoring or treatment appears to \n   \n-13- \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page15 of 227\n \n1  have been made.   \n2  53.  Despite notice of Claypoleโs serious mental illness, erratic behavior, \n3  and the dangerous mix of narcotics and psychotropic medication he was suspected \n4  to have consumed, County of San Mateo released Joshua Claypole on April 30, \n5  2013, at 11:24 a.m. on the condition that he promise to appear for his DUI \n6  arraignment.  \n7  C.  Claypoleโs Repeated Visits to the CHOMP Facility Where He Had \n8  Previously Received Treatment \n9  54.  After his release from San Mateo, Joshua Claypole traveled south to \n10  Monterey.  \n11  55.  At approximately 8:30 a.m. on May 1, 2013, Joshua Claypole arrived \n12  at the Hartnell Professional Center, which houses CHOMP. He had been treated by \n13  CHOMP between March and August 2012, and that morning went to the outpatient \n14  behavioral health clinic on the second floor where he had previously been a patient. \n15  Despite CHOMPโs prior relationship with Claypole and his obvious symptoms of a \n16  mental health crisis, CHOMP personnel did not provide medical or mental health \n17  treatment to Claypole.  Rather, they directed Claypole to leave, and called the \n18  Monterey Police Department. By the time police officers arrived, Claypole had \n19  already left. \n20  56.  Joshua Claypole returned to CHOMP later that same morning at \n21  approximately 11:00 a.m. He again visited CHOMPโs behavioral health clinic. This \n22  time, CHOMP personnel responded by deploying their internal security officers to \n23  escort him out of the building, again failing to examine or treat Claypole. Despite \n24  their physical custody of Claypole, and awareness of his troubled mental state, \n25  CHOMP personnel refused to treat him, examine him, detain him, or provide any \n26  medical or mental health assistance to him. Instead, CHOMP security officers threw \n27  Claypole out of the building and again called the Monterey Police Department. \n28  /// \n   \n-14- \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page16 of 227\n \n1  57.  Immediately after CHOMP security officers physically ejected him, \n2  Claypole went to a local Wells Fargo bank branch in Monterey, presumably to \n3  obtain money for a rental car so he could return to Redwood City for his \n4  impounded car. Wells Fargo employees confirmed that his strange behavior was \n5  clearly observable, later telling Monterey Police Department officers that Claypole \n6  appeared to be โon a substance,โ โvery unstable,โ โout of it,โ and โin and out of \n7  consciousness.โ They stated that Claypole displayed mood changes and would at \n8  times be unresponsive to conversation. At the register of the bank, he did not talk \n9  and made strange movements with his head. After withdrawing money from a bank \n10  account he shared with his mother, Claypole requested Wells Fargo staff hale him a \n11  taxi cab. \n12  D.  Detention in Monterey County \n13  58.  According to Monterey Police Department reports, Claypole got into a  \n14  taxi shortly thereafter outside of the Wells Fargo branch, and, at approximately 1:10 \n15  p.m., fatally stabbed the taxi driver, Daniel Garcia Huerta, outside an Enterprise \n16  Rent-A-Car Company location on Del Monte Avenue in Monterey, California. \n17  Claypole was then detained by Seaside Police Department officers a short distance \n18  away in a stolen pickup truck. Monterey Police Department officers arrived at the \n19  scene thereafter and took custody of Claypole. After the owner of the pickup truck \n20  identified Claypole, Monterey Police Department personnel arrested him.  \n21  59.  According to police reports, when Claypole was seated in the back of \n22  Defendant MPD Officer Brent Hallโs squad car, he spontaneously asked Defendant \n23  Hall, โCan you ask for the [lethal] injection?โ He also told Defendant Hall, โI had \n24  to do it.โ \n25  60.  During the booking process, Claypole asked Defendant Hall โShould I \n26  go? I should just take the injection.โ  \n27  61.  While waiting to be interviewed by a detective, Joshua Claypole asked \n28  Hall โIs my mom going to get my remains?โ Claypole again told Hall that he \n   \n-15- \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page17 of 227\n \n1  wanted to die by lethal injection and that he wanted to have his body cremated.  \n2  62.  Despite these suicidal comments, neither Defendant Hall nor \n3  Defendant Monterey Police Department informed the Monterey County Sheriffโs \n4  Department that Joshua Claypole was acting strangely or a suicide risk. Rather than \n5  assessing his mental health issues adequately, or notifying the County of Monterey, \n6  his subsequent custodian, Defendants Hall and City of Monterey failed to take any \n7  appropriate or necessary action in the face of a clearly paranoid and suicidal \n8  detainee. \n9  63.  At approximately 8:30 p.m. on May 1, Joshua Claypole met with his \n10  criminal defense lawyer, John Klopfenstein. During the meeting, Claypole appeared \n11  paranoid and talked about killing himself. Klopfenstein then spoke to Officer Candi \n12  McGregor at the jail at approximately 8:45 p.m. and requested that Claypole be \n13  placed on suicide watch, per a memorandum drafted by McGregor. McGregor \n14  noted that she immediately contacted Defendant Sergeant E. Kaye, the on-duty \n15  Sergeant. Sergeant Kaye advised McGregor that she would follow up on the \n16  situation.  \n17  64.  According to County of Monterey records, an โIntake Health \n18  Screeningโ of Joshua Claypole was conducted at 9:05 p.m. on May 1, 2013. During \n19  the screening, Claypole told the screening deputy that he was taking medication for \n20  anxiety.  However, the screening form used to document the examination did not \n21  indicate that any questions were asked regarding Claypoleโs history of mental \n22  health diagnoses or prior mental health treatment. Despite Claypoleโs suicidal \n23  statements to the transporting police officers and reports from Claypoleโs lawyer to \n24  jail staff that Claypole was unstable and talked about killing himself, the Intake \n25  Health Screening shows the โnoโ box checked for โDoes behavior suggest a danger \n26  to self or others?โ  Similarly, despite Claypoleโs self-report that he took anxiety \n27  medications, the Intake Health Screening does not reflect any referral of Claypole \n28  to a psychiatrist or other mental health staff.   \n   \n-16- \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page18 of 227\n \n1  65.  County of Monterey Sheriffโs personnel also completed a form entitled \n2  โClassification Inmate Intake Screening Questionnaire,โ dated May 1, 2013, at 9:05 \n3  p.m. Notwithstanding the recent events, Claypoleโs statements to the police \n4  officers, Claypoleโs psychiatric history, and his attorneyโs report of suicidal \n5  symptoms and request to have him placed on suicide watch, the Questionnaire \n6  indicates that Claypole had not shown any bizarre behavior and that he was not now \n7  nor had he ever been under psychiatric care.  \n8  66.  Monterey County Jail staff failed to place Claypole on suicide watch \n9  on May 1, 2014, despite his attorneyโs direct report of suicidal symptoms and \n10  request for such precautions. \n11  67.  On May 2, Klopfenstein visited Claypole at the Jail. During this \n12  second meeting, Claypole asked Mr. Klopfenstein to have his mother bring his \n13  medications to the jail.  \n14  68.  On May 3, Joshua Claypole made his first appearance in court \n15  regarding the criminal charges. That same day, Claypole exhibited severe mental \n16  instability, believing that others were speaking to him telepathically through his \n17  thoughts. Mr. Klopfenstein assumed that the Jail had responded appropriately to his \n18  request to place Claypole on suicide watch. \n19  69.  However, the medical records from County of Monterey reflect that it \n20  was not until 2:35 p.m. on May 3, two days after Klopfenstein first requested \n21  suicide watch, that Defendants finally placed Claypole on suicide watch and \n22  transferred Claypole to a safety cell where he was supposed to be observed by Jail \n23  staff.   \n24  70.  Fewer than twenty-four hours later, at approximately 6:30 a.m. on May \n25  4, Defendants inexplicably released Claypole from suicide watch without any \n26  further suicide risk precautions. \n27  71.  At approximately 1 p.m. on May 4, 2013, Silvia Guersenzvaig arrived \n28  at Monterey County Jail to visit her son and to bring him his psychotropic \n   \n-17- \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page19 of 227\n \n1  medications, per his request.  However, Jail staff refused to allow her to see her son, \n2  telling her that Claypole had been moved to a different housing unit and visitation \n3  hours for that unit had not begun. Guersenzvaig gave Claypoleโs medications to a \n4  Jail nurse summoned by the on-duty officer. Denied the ability to visit her son, \n5  Guersenzvaig said to the nurse, โPlease tell Josh I love him regardless of what \n6  happened.โ  \n7  72.  On information and belief, Jail staff did not provide the medications \n8  brought by Silvia Guersenzvaig to Joshua Claypole.   \n9  73.  At a โwelfare checkโ conducted at approximately 2:30 p.m. on May 4, \n10  2013, Monterey County Deputy Sheriff Raymond Gordano found Joshua Claypole \n11  hanging from a cloth noose made of torn bed sheets inside his cell.  \n12  74.  According to the declaration of Dr. Pablo Stewart, an expert whose \n13  declaration was filed by plaintiffs in Hernandez v. County of Monterey, Jail staff \n14  failed to appropriately and timely respond to Claypoleโs suicide. Rather than \n15  immediately open the cell to cut down the ligature, Gordano requested back up by \n16  custody and medical staff. (See Exhibit 4 at ยถ 96.) Staff did not open Claypoleโs \n17  cell and begin to assist him until other staff arrived on the scene. (Id.) Jail personnel \n18  eventually cut the ligature using a knife, with some difficulty. (Id.) \n19  75.  At the time of his suicide, Claypole was housed in A Pod, an \n20  administrative segregation housing unit. The cell included a set of sturdy metal \n21  braces on the wall, which are suicide hazards in cells used for inmates in mental \n22  health crisis. Claypole tied the sheet he used to hang himself to these metal braces. \n23  76.  Jail records reflect the failure of jail staff to follow their own policies \n24  and procedures during and after suicide watch.  During the period when Claypole \n25  was placed in suicide watch, Jail personnel did not perform the required checks \n26  twice every 30 minutes, instead checking on him only once in some one-hour \n27  periods.  After removing him from suicide watch, Jail personnel did not check on \n28  Claypole hourly, as required by Jail policies. County of Montereyโs Hourly Safety \n   \n-18- \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page20 of 227\n \n1  Check log indicates that at the time staff discovered him hanging, staff had not \n2  performed a safety check for Claypole in over 6 hours.   \n3  77.  According to jail policies and procedures, as recounted by Dr. \n4  Hayward, no mental health personnel are on site at the Jail on weekends. \n5  Nevertheless, County of Monterey removed Claypole from suicide watch on \n6  Saturday when, upon information or belief, no mental health care staff were on site \n7  at the Jail.  Once Claypole was removed from suicide watch and placed back in \n8  general population, there were no mental health staff at the jail to monitor his \n9  condition, and custody staff failed to perform the required hourly safety checks.   \n10  78.  Defendantโs failure to appropriately staff its jail facility and monitor \n11  Claypole despite known and foreseeable suicide risks resulted in Claypole hanging \n12  himself just a few hours after his removal from suicide watch. \n13  79.  After staff discovered him hanging, Joshua Claypole was transferred to \n14  the care of emergency room personnel at Natividad Medical Center, then \n15  transported to the Trauma Center at San Jose Regional Medical Center via \n16  helicopter.  \n17  80.  Shortly after finding his body, Jail deputies found a handwritten \n18  suicide letter written by Claypole in his cell. Addressing his mother, Claypole \n19  wrote: โI love you mama. Iโm sorry for all the pain I have brought you mama. I love \n20  you very much. Maybe I will see you again. Love, Joshua.โ \n21  81.  On May 9, 2013, Joshua Claypole was declared dead. A subsequent \n22  County of Monterey postmortem examination conducted on May 13, 2013, \n23  concluded that he died from asphyxia due to hanging. \n24  /// \n25  /// \n26  /// \n27   \n   \n28 \n   \n-19- \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page21 of 227\n \n1  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n2  First Claim for Relief \n3  Deliberate Indifference to Serious Medical and Mental Health Needs in \n4  Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United \n5  States (Survival Action โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n6  (Against Defendants County of San Mateo, Greg Munks, County of Monterey, \n7  Scott Miller, E. Kaye, California Forensic Medical Group, Taylor Fithian, and \n8  Does 1 through 20) \n9  82.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through \n10  81 as though fully set forth herein.  \n11  83.  Defendants have inadequate policies, procedures, and practices for \n12  identifying inmates in need of medical and mental health treatment and providing \n13  appropriate medical and mental health treatment. Defendants also fail to \n14  appropriately train and supervise staff regarding the provision of treatment to \n15  inmates with medical and mental health issues.  \n16  84.  Defendants have consistently failed to meet their constitutional \n17  obligation to provide adequate mental health care to prisoners in their jails.  The \n18  mental health care provided by Defendants to prisoners in their jails is woefully \n19  inadequate and falls far short of all of the minimum elements of a constitutional \n20  mental health care system.  Defendantsโ failure to correct their policies, procedures, \n21  and practices, despite notice of significant and dangerous problems, evidences \n22  deliberate indifference in the provision of mental health treatment. \n23  85.  Defendants knew or should have known that there was a strong \n24  likelihood that Joshua Claypole posed a threat to himself or others. \n25  86.  Defendants failed to provide necessary medical and mental health \n26  evaluation and treatment to Joshua Claypole while he was held at the Maguire \nCorrectional Facility and Monterey County Jail, despite his history of serious \n27 \nmental illness, obvious symptoms of mental health crisis, and information that he \n28 \n   \n-20- \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page22 of 227\n \n1  was under the influence of narcotics.   \n2  87.  Defendantsโ acts and/or omissions as alleged herein, including but not \n3  limited to their failure to provide Joshua Claypole with appropriate medical or \n4  psychiatric care and to identify suicide risk, along with the acts and/or omissions of \n5  the Defendants in failing to train, supervise and/or promulgate appropriate policies \n6  and procedures in order to identify suicide risk and provide treatment, constituted \n7  deliberate indifference to Joshua Claypoleโs serious medical needs, health and \n8  safety. \n9  88.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ conduct, Joshua \n10  Claypole experienced physical pain, severe emotional distress, and mental anguish \n11  over a period of five days, as well as loss of his life and other damages alleged \n12  herein. \n13  89.  The aforementioned acts of Defendants were conducted with \n14  conscious disregard for the safety of Plaintiffs and others, and were therefore \n15  malicious, wanton, and oppressive. As a result, Defendantsโ actions justify an \n16  award of exemplary and punitive damages to punish the wrongful conduct alleged \n17  herein and to deter such conduct in the future.   \n18  Second Claim for Relief \n19  Failure to Protect from Harm in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to \n20  the Constitution of the United States (Survival Action โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n21  (Against Defendants County of San Mateo, Greg Munks, County of Monterey, \n22  Scott Miller, E.

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through \n25  89 as though fully set forth herein. \n26  91.  Each Defendant could have taken action to prevent unnecessary harm \n27  to Joshua Claypole, but refused or failed to do so.  \n28  /// \n   \n-21- \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page23 of 227\n \n1  92.  Defendants failed to have minimally necessary policies and procedures \n2  concerning the adequate identification and housing of Claypole, whom they knew \n3  or should have known to be at risk of self-harm.  \n4  93.  City of Monterey, Philip Penko, and Brent Hall failed to take \n5  necessary precautions to ensure that Claypole would not harm himself or others \n6  after he communicated clearly suicidal thoughts to Monterey Police Department \n7  officers. They also failed to create minimally necessary policies and procedures for \n8  ensuring that other entities and municipalities were informed of suicide risks among \n9  Monterey Police Department arrestees who are transferred from their custody. \n10  Lastly, they failed to adequately train and supervise officers to protect arrestees \n11  from harm. \n12  94.  County Defendants failed to implement minimally sufficient policies \n13  and procedures to protect inmates from harm. County Defendants failed to \n14  appropriately train and supervise staff regarding identification and handling of \n15  detainees at risk of harm. With respect to Joshua Claypole, County Defendants \n16  failed to follow even their own suicide prevention procedures to identify, house, \n17  and monitor detainees at risk of self-harm.  \n18  95.  Defendantsโ acts and/or omissions as alleged herein, including but not \n19  limited to their failure to take appropriate measures to protect Joshua Claypole from \n20  harm, along with the acts and/or omissions of the Defendants in failing to train, \n21  supervise and/or promulgate appropriate policies and procedures in order to protect \n22  Joshua Claypole from harm, constituted deliberate indifference to Joshua \n23  Claypoleโs serious medical needs, health, and safety. \n24  96.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ conduct, Joshua \n25  Claypole experienced physical pain, severe emotional distress, and mental anguish \n26  over a period of five days, as well as loss of his life and other damages alleged \n27  herein. \n28  /// \n   \n-22- \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page24 of 227\n \n1  97.  The aforementioned acts of Defendants were willful, wanton, \n2  malicious, and oppressive, thereby justifying an award to Plaintiffs of exemplary \n3  and punitive damages to punish the wrongful conduct alleged herein and to deter \n4  such conduct in the future.   \n5  Third Claim for Relief \n6  Deprivation of Substantive Due Process Rights in Violation of First and \n7  Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States โ Loss of \n8  Parent/Child Relationship (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n9  (Against Defendants County of San Mateo, Greg Munks, County of Monterey, \n10  Scott Miller, E.

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through \n13  97 as though fully set forth herein. \n14  99.  The aforementioned acts and/or omissions of Defendants in being \n15  deliberatively indifferent to Joshua Claypoleโs serious medical needs, health and \n16  safety, violating Joshua Claypoleโs constitutional rights, and their failure to train, \n17  supervise, and/or take other appropriate measures to prevent the acts and/or \n18  omissions that caused the untimely and wrongful death of Joshua Claypole \n19  deprived Plaintiff Guersenzvaig of her liberty interest in the parent-child \n20  relationship in violation of her substantive due process rights as defined by the First \n21  and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \n22  100.  As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned acts and/or \n23  omissions of Defendants, Plaintiffs suffered injuries and damages as alleged herein. \n24  101.  The aforementioned acts and/or omissions of the individually named \n25  Defendants were willful, wanton, malicious, and oppressive, thereby justifying an \n26  award of exemplary and punitive damages to punish the wrongful conduct alleged \n27  herein and to deter such conduct in the future. \n28  /// \n   \n-23- \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page25 of 227\n \n1  Fourth Claim for Relief \n2  Medical Malpractice (Survival Actions โ California State Law) \n3  (Against Defendants California Forensic Medical Group, Taylor Fithian, and \n4  Community Hospital of Monterey Peninsula) \n5  102.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through \n6  101 as though fully set forth herein. \n7  103.  Defendants failed to comply with professional standards in the \n8  treatment of Joshua Claypoleโs serious mental illness by failing to appropriately \n9  assess and evaluate his mental health and suicide risk, failing to take appropriate \n10  and timely suicide prevention measures, prematurely removing Claypole from \n11  suicide watch and returning him to an unsafe cell, failing to provide appropriate \n12  mental health treatment, and failing to prescribe or provide appropriate and \n13  necessary psychiatric medications and ensure compliance with those medications. \n14  104.  Defendants also failed to appropriately supervise, review, and ensure \n15  the competence of medical staffโs and custody staffโs provision of treatment to \n16  Claypole, and failed to enact appropriate standards and procedures that would have \n17  prevented such harm to him.  \n18  105.  As a direct and proximate cause of this negligence and failure to meet \n19  their professional standards of care, Joshua Claypole and Silvia Guersenzvaig \n20  suffered injuries and damages as alleged herein. \n21  106.  The negligent conduct of these Defendants was committed within the \n22  course and scope of their employment. \n23  107.  The aforementioned acts of Defendants were willful, wanton, \n24  malicious, and oppressive, thereby justifying an award of exemplary and punitive \n25  damages to punish the wrongful conduct alleged herein and to deter such conduct in \n26  the future.  \n27  /// \n28  ///  \n   \n-24- \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page26 of 227\n \n1  Fifth Claim for Relief \n2  Failure to Furnish / Summon Medical Care (Survival Action โ California State \n3  Law) \n4  (Against Defendants County of Monterey, Scott Miller, E.

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through \n8  107 as though fully set forth herein. \n9  109.  Defendants owed Joshua Claypole a duty of care to provide him \n10  immediate medical and mental health care. \n11  110.  The conduct of Defendants alleged herein, including but not limited to \n12  the facts that Defendants knew or had reason to know that Joshua Claypole was in \n13  need of immediate medical and mental health care and that Defendants failed to \n14  take reasonable action to summon or provide that care, resulting in Joshua \n15  Claypoleโs death as alleged herein, violated California state law, including Cal. \n16  Govt. Code ยงยง 844.6 and 845.6. \n17  111.  Defendants also failed to timely and appropriately respond to Joshua \n18  Claypoleโs expressions of suicidal ideation, in which he requested that he be killed \n19  and stated his desire to kill himself on numerous occasions before hanging himself \n20  in his cell. \n21  112.  The alleged conduct of Defendants was committed within the course \n22  and scope of their employment. \n23  113.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ breach, Joshua \n24  Claypole and Silvia Guersenzvaig suffered injuries and damages causing great pain \n25  and leading to his death, as alleged herein. \n26  114.

Joshua Claypoleโs death was a direct and proximate result of the \n26  aforementioned wrongful and/or negligent acts and/or omissions of Defendants.  \n27  Defendantsโ acts and/or omissions thus were also a direct and proximate cause of \n28  Plaintiffโ injuries and damages, as alleged herein. \n   \n-26- \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page28 of 227\n \n1  121.

The aforementioned acts of Defendants were willful, wanton, \n15  malicious, and oppressive, thereby justifying an award to Plaintiff of exemplary and \n16  punitive damages to punish the wrongful conduct alleged herein and to deter such \n17  conduct in the future.   \n18  Eighth Claim for Relief \n19  Negligence (Survival Actions โ California State Law) \n20  (Against Defendants County of Monterey, Scott Miller, E.

The Monterey County Defendants failed to comply with professional \n25  standards in the treatment of Joshua Claypoleโs serious mental illness by failing to \n26  appropriately assess and evaluate his mental health and suicide risk, failing to take \n27  appropriate and timely suicide prevention measures, prematurely removing \n28  Claypole from suicide watch and returning him to an unsafe cell, failing to provide \n   \n-27- \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page29 of 227\n \n1  appropriate mental health treatment, and failing to prescribe or provide appropriate \n2  and necessary psychiatric medications and ensure compliance with those \n3  medications. \n4  127.  These Defendants also failed to appropriately supervise, review, and \n5  ensure the competence of medical staffโs and custody staffโs provision of treatment \n6  to Claypole, and failed to enact appropriate standards and procedures that would \n7  have prevented such harm to him.  \n8  128.  Together, these Defendants acted negligently and improperly, \n9  breached their respective duties, and as a direct and proximate result, Joshua \n10  Claypole and Silvia Guersenzvaig suffered injuries and damages as alleged herein. \n11  129.  The negligent conduct of Defendants was committed within the course \n12  and scope of their employment. \n13  130.  The aforementioned acts of Defendants were conducted with \n14  conscious disregard for the safety of Plaintiffs and others, and were therefore \n15  malicious, wanton, and oppressive.

Elements of the System \n \nExisting  Monterey  County  Jail.  \nThe  Monterey  County  Jail  is \nlocated at 1410 Natividad Road, \nSalinas, California 93906.  The jail \nconsists of three components: \n \n1.  The Rehabilitation Facility. \n2.  The Main Jail. \n3.  The Womanโs Jail. \n \nExisting Jail Bed Capacity.  The \nrated jail capacity as calculated by \nthe  Corrections  Standards \nAuthority  (CSA)  is  illustrated  in \nTable EX.1. \n  Monterey County Jail \n \nTable EX.1 \nCSA Rated Jail Bed Capacity \n \nRated Beds  Total Beds \nMain Jail/Womanโs Jail 575 Beds\nRehabilitation Facility  250 Beds\nTotal Beds  825 Beds\n              Source.  Corrections Standards Authority.  April 2010. \n \n \nShortfall  Using  the  High  Projection. When  the  825  existing  beds  are  considered,  the  additional  bed \nrequirements for 2020 through 2040 using the average projection are illustrated in Table EX.2 below. \n \n \nTable EX.2 \nAdult Detention Facility Additional Bed Need 2020 - 2040 (Average) \n \nYear  Additional Beds Needed \n2020  1,727 Beds \n2030  2,008 Beds \n2040  2,307 Beds \n  Source.  TRGConsulting.  December 2011. \n \n \nThe table above indicates that an additional 2,008 beds will be required in 2030 if the county elects to \nconstruct enough beds to meet their twenty-year needs using the average projections. \n \nPlease note that it is recommended that Monterey County target the 2030 needs as an immediate \nrequirement  since  the  new  adult  detention  facility  will  start  to  become  overcrowded  almost \nimmediately upon opening should the first phase only consist of enough beds to meet the 2020 \nneeds.  The existing severely overcrowded conditions have been exacerbated by the enactment of AB \n109.1 \n \n                                                        \n1  AB 109, Criminal Justice Alignment, has been modified by AB 117, Criminal Justice Realignment. \nTRGConsulting \n  EX.1 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page39 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page9 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \n \nUrgent Service Gap in the Adult Criminal Justice System.  The most urgent service gap is the need for a new \ndetention beds and additional staff.  The current combination of insufficient beds, an inadequate detention \nfacility and understaffing has resulted in an almost untenable situation.  This service gap is illustrated by the \nfollowing. \n \n(cid:1)  There are not enough beds to meet the current adult detention needs, let alone the needs in the near \nfuture.  Worse, the county has the wrong type of beds for the population currently incarcerated.  As \nan example, over 75% of the beds are in dormitories; while over 80% of the inmates are felons. The \nfacility was designed for minimum and low medium-security inmates while the bulk of the inmates \ncurrently held are medium and maximum-security inmates.  This situation is exacerbated by AB 109 \nas modified by AB 117, which requires counties to house selected inmates who previously were \nhoused by the state.  If additional beds are not constructed, criminals who should be incarcerated will \nnot be incarcerated since beds space will not be available. Criminals serving time will serve little or \nnone of their time since the beds to which they are assigned will be needed for others who pose a \ngreater danger to public safety.  An extensive and unpopular early release system (i.e. releasing \ninmates well before their full sentence is served) will be required to prevent even more severe \novercrowding.2 \n(cid:1)  Overcrowding, the lack of adequate staff and an insufficient number of single and double cells has \nresulted in the necessity of classifying inmates primarily by gang affiliation.  While gang membership \ntypically is one of the factors used in classifying inmates, it is not normally the primary consideration.  \nExisting court decisions allow for segregation by race and gangs only as a โtemporary measuresโ \nwhen classification by race is necessary to allow staff to get the facility under control. \n(cid:1)  Officer safety is compromised by the severe lack of an adequate number of single and double cells. \n(cid:1)  The jail is so overcrowded that no allowance can be made for peaking and classification or the routine \nor emergency maintenance required in inmate housing areas. \n(cid:1)  Severe overcrowding has resulted in inmates being held in the intake area for up to forty-eight hours.  \nThis is not permitted by the California Code of Regulations. \n(cid:1)  Severe overcrowding has forced the Sheriff to use areas for housing that were not designed or \nintended for that use (e.g. the rotunda area). This makes these areas much more difficult for officers \nto manage and control. \n(cid:1)  Overcrowding has forced the Sheriff to operate the jail as an indirect supervision facility, while the jail \nwas designed for direct supervision.  This creates significant command, control and management \nproblems. \n(cid:1)  Adequate  separation  and  segregation  resulting  from  the  classification  of  inmates  cannot  occur \nbecause of the severe overcrowding and the lack of a sufficient number of single and double cells.  \nThus, while the staff has the ability to classify, they do not have the ability to physically segregate \nthose inmates who should be separated because of their classification.  This creates an environment \nthat is unsafe for officers, inmates and visitors. \n(cid:1)  The design of the jail and the manner in which additions have been constructed results in a physical \nplant that is difficult to manage and control and unnecessarily expensive to operate.  Numerous blind \nspots and the labyrinth like design requires more staff than would be required in a state-of-the-art \npodular facility.  There is poor observation from most deputy stations.  Officers cannot observe inmate \nareas in Pods A through J.  The wing walls in the dormitories are approximately four feet high and \nprovide a number of areas where inmates cannot be observed. \n(cid:1)  The manner in which additions have been constructed has resulted in a facility that lacks any real \ncentral control or command post that would be used in the event of a major disturbance or disaster.  \nThe  existence  of  multiple  control  stations  is  unnecessarily  staff  intensive  in  facility  that  is \nunderstaffed. \n(cid:1)  The age of the building systems in the sections of the jail constructed prior to 1993 require extensive \nmaintenance and, as a result, these systems are more expensive to operate.  Maintenance costs \nalready are increasing and will continue to increase at a faster rate as the facility deteriorates. \n                                                        \n2   The jail population regularly exceeds 1,000 inmates in a facility rated at 825.  Overcrowding already has reached a \ndangerous level. \nTRGConsulting \n  EX.2 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page40 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page10 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \n \n(cid:1)  The older design of the cells and dormitories constructed prior to 1993 does not meet todayโs \nminimum standards for acceptable detention facilities.  Examples include: \n \nโ  Suicide hazard elimination is not as stringent as it should be to prevent self-harm and the \nattendant liability. \nโ  Medical/mental health treatment spaces are not adequate for the rated beds, let alone the actual \nnumber of inmates held.3 \nโ  Design requirements to improve security and the management of inmates are not met (e.g. \nnumber of toilet fixtures and showers per inmate, number of safety and sobering cells needed for \nefficient operation, adequate intake and release facilities, sufficient storage, etc.). \nโ  There are insufficient spaces dedicated to programs.  Effective programs are necessary to \nmanage the jail population and reduce recidivism. \nโ  Overcrowding forces the entire facility to operate as an indirect supervision jail.  Mental health \nissues are considerably more difficult to recognize, manage and treat in an indirect supervision \nfacility.  A direct supervision, podular design in which staff is able to interact continuously with \ninmates makes it significantly easier to detect inmates with mental health problems.  Additionally \na direct supervision model reduces conflict and allows better observation of those requiring \ntreatment. \n \nโข  Understaffing has resulted in insufficient staff coverage.  This all too frequently results in a four-hour \ngap in the middle of twelve-hour shifts.  At times the middle of a shift may be as many as three or four \nofficers short.  This has been exacerbated by recent staff reductions.4  As a result there are not \nenough officers present in the jail to respond to a major crisis or natural disaster.5 \nโข  Understaffing has resulted in the extensive use of CCTV cameras to monitor inmate activities.  CCTV \nnever can substitute for officer presence. \nโข  The attrition rate of trained detention officers is quite high.6 \nโข  Because of understaffing, the Sheriff is forced to use pre-academy hires in the jail. \nโข  Understaffing has increased the span of control for first line supervisors to an unacceptable level. \nโข  Sergeants are sometimes forced to work line positions because of lack of staff.  This results in a lack \nof supervision of the staff in the jail. \nโข  There are insufficient staff on some shifts to make the required safety checks. \nโข  Reduced staffing makes it difficult for staff to supervise inmates in the kitchen and the laundry. \nโข  Staff shortages have resulted in the excessive use of overtime. \n \n \nIdentified Need (Facility Type).  As discussed above, additional beds urgently need to be constructed at the \nNatividad site.  The Monterey County Jail will remain a Type II Facility (i.e. a local detention facility used for \nthe detention of persons pending arraignment, during trial and upon sentence of commitment as defined in \nTitle 24 of the California Code of Regulations). \n                                                        \n3   For example, it is estimated that at least fifteen to twenty percent of the inmate population have mental health issues. \n4   In January 2011 there were 220 personnel in the Custody Bureau (Sworn and Unsworn).  The recent budget cuts ($6.4 \nmillion in the Sheriffสผs Office) have reduced Custody Bureau staff to 183 people assigned, a reduction of thirty-seven \npositions in a facility that already was woefully understaffed.  All vacant positions were eliminated in the most recent \nbudget cuts.  Finally, on December 13, 2011, the Board of Supervisors approved twelve new civilian (non-sworn) hires \nto replace deputies serving in unit control stations.  This will make those deputies serving in control available to work in \nthe jail.  The twelve deputies now serving in control then will be available for other duties in the jail.  The civilian hires \nare expected to be trained and on duty in February 2012.  Thus the net loss of jail personnel since January 2011 is \ntwenty-five positions.  Unfortunately the net loss includes a Captainสผs position and two Commanderสผs positions. \n5   Staff in the jail work twelve-hour shifts.  When insufficient staff is available for a particular shift for whatever reason, the \nSheriff is forced to hold over staff from the previous shift for four hours and bring in staff from the following shift four \nhours early.  This results in a four-hour gap in the shift that is short of staff.  Worse, this results in some officers \nworking sixteen-hour shifts. \n6   The Custody Bureau has indicated that they continue to lose trained deputies for a variety of reasons including the \ndesire of newer deputies to work in patrol, the opportunity to work nearer to home in another agency and the fact that \nthere are other more desirable opportunities available in law enforcement. \nTRGConsulting \n  EX.3 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page41 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page11 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \n \nB.  Operational and Design Philosophy   \n \nPurpose.  The purpose of the Monterey County Adult Detention and Rehabilitation Facilities is the detention of \npersons charged with crimes and awaiting arraignment or trial. \n \n1.   The detention of persons, in the Sheriffโs custody, to ensure their attendance as witnesses in criminal \ncases. \n \n2.   The confinement of persons sentenced to imprisonment in the County Facilities.7 \n \nGoal.  By means of the continuing process of education and training of the deputies and professional staff \nemployed herein, to provide for the security, health and welfare of inmates in custody and to rehabilitate them \nwhenever possible through programs designed for this purpose.8 \n \nDesign Goals for the New Adult Detention Beds and Support Spaces.  The immediate design goal is to \nmaximize the number of new detention beds in cells at the current site, using existing support infrastructure \nand administrative space as much as possible.  The specific design objectives for the new adult detention \nbeds and support space are discussed in detail in the body of this assessment. \n \nConstruction and Administrative Work Plan.  Similarly, the construction and administrative work plan for the \nnew adult detention facility is discussed in the body of this report. \n \nC.  Current Adult Population \n \nCurrent  Adult  Population.    The  Corrections  Standards \nAuthority (CSA) provides summary data collected for the Jail \nProfile Survey.  Crime and arrest data for Monterey County \nalso is available for 2006 through 2009 from the California \nDepartment  of  Justice  (DOJ).    A  โsnapshotโ  from  2006 \nthrough 2009 (the last full data year of information from the \nCalifornia Department of Justice) is indicative of the current \njail population.  This section provides statistical data on the jail \npopulation, including: \n \n1.  Felony Sentenced Dispositions; \n2.  Crime and Crime Rates; and \n3.  Sentenced  and  Non-Sentenced  Adult  Detention \nThe Monterey County Main Jail.  Populations by Gender. \n \n \nConclusion.  Over the last decade, violent felony reports and arrests according to statistics maintained by the \nCalifornia Department of Justice have fluctuated; therefore a predictable upward or downward trend has not \noccurred.  Unfortunately the number of beds available for holding these offenders has been well below the \nnumber and type needed throughout that timeframe.  As a result, the classification and segregation of \ninmates is extremely difficult given the type of beds available to house them.  This places staff, visitors and \ninmates in the facility at risk of injury or death.  With an insufficient number of maximum and medium-security \nbeds the staff must choose the โleast violentโ of the violent offenders to house in minimum-security dormitory \nbeds since there are no medium-security double cells.  It is obvious that the system is dangerously out of \nbalance in terms of the types of beds available and the classification of inmates held. \n                                                        \n7  Monterey County Sheriff(cid:1)s Manual, Section 1101.03 A.

Classification of Inmates \n \nClassification Issues.  The proper classification of inmates is critical in the Monterey County Jail because of \nthe age of the facility and the lack of enough single and double cells to properly separate and segregate \ninmates.  The number of violent gang members currently held at the existing adult detention facility further \nexacerbates the difficulty in classification.  Classification officers classify primarily by gang affiliation because \nof insufficient staff, inadequate facilities and severe overcrowding. \n \nIn Monterey County there is the possibility of misclassifying inmates based on space rather than security \nlevel.  Overcrowding reduces the ability to classify.  This is further compounded by the dormitory design.  \nNormally, 10% - 15% of the beds should be empty and available for classification spikes and maintenance.   \n \n \nโNeedโ Resulting from the Desire to Properly Separate and Segregate Inmates.  Proper separation and \nsegregation of inmates as envisioned in the Sheriffโs classification plan is very difficult because of insufficient \nstaff, an inadequate physical plant layout and the severe overcrowding that makes it necessary to unofficially \nadd  well  over  300  beds  above  the  CSA  rated  capacity.    These  problems  can  be  alleviated  with  the \nconstruction of new housing or a new facility properly sized to meet future needs.  (One of the design goals \nfor the new facility is to have a sufficient number of single and double cells for the proper separation of \ninmates of differing classification.) \n \n \nE.  Programs \n \nPrograms Present and Future.  The existing Monterey \nCounty Jail lacks adequate space to conduct any kind of \nmeaningful programs to reduce recidivism.  Worse, the \nsevere overcrowding and insufficient staff make it almost \nimpossible for the Sheriff to conduct any but the most \nbasic programs (e.g. religious services and counseling, \nbasic mental health programs and counseling, visiting, \ncommissary,  counseling  by  health  care  providers, \nAlcoholics  Anonymous  and  Narcotics  Anonymous \nclasses, etc.). \n \nA new adult detention facility with adequate program \nspace will allow for a wide variety of programs to reduce \nrecidivism.  Not only will the Sheriffโs Office be able to \nenhance existing programs, but staff also will be able to \nSevere overcrowding and lack of space make it  introduce  a  number  of  programs  that  have  been \nextremely difficult to offer programs.  successful in other jurisdictions.  Examples include: \n \nโข  expanding mental health programs and therapy sessions; \nโข  additional programs specifically designed for female inmates; \nโข  developing an adult literacy program; \nโข  providing tutoring for inmates seeking a GED; \nโข  increasing the number of Bible study sessions and expanding religious programs; \nโข  increasing the number of AA meetings and providing additional alcohol abuse counseling; \nโข  enhancing the narcotics abuse program with additional meetings and therapy sessions; and \nโข  providing health education on a wider variety of subjects. \n \n \nAdditional programs that are being considered for implementation in the new facility are discussed in the body \nof the report. \n \nTRGConsulting \n  EX.5 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page43 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page13 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \n \nF.

Adequacy of Staffing Levels \n \nExisting Conditions. The Monterey County Jail is \nfacing  a  number  of  staff  related  issues.    These \nissues affect the overall security of the facility and \nthe morale of the staff. \n \nStaffing Issues.  Detention facilities must be staffed \n24 hours a day, 7 days a week (24/7) in order to \nfulfill  their  mandate  to  provide  safe  and  secure \nhousing for those inmates under their care.  Staff \nwithin the Monterey County Jail must be available \nto receive new bookings in the jail, provide medical \ncare, classify and move inmates within the facility, \nmaintain  staff  and  inmate  safety  and  security, \nprovide  recreation  and  exercise,  ensure  inmates \nare  fed,  transport  inmates  to  court  or  outside \nagencies and lawfully release inmates.  Due to its \nnature, a jail cannot simply discontinue operation \nEighty percent of the beds at the Monterey County Jail are \n(e.g. refuse to accept prisoners) if there is not a \nin dormitories while eighty percent of the inmates are \nperson available to fill a position.  When detention \nfelons. \nfacilities  are  not  staffed  adequately,  overtime  is \nnecessary to cover an unfilled post. \n \nThe major staffing issues facing the Monterey County Jail are:  \n \n1. It appears that the staffing provided by the County salary ordinance is based on the rated capacity of the \nfacility, not on how many inmates are actually in custody.   \n \n2.  There has not been an updated relief factor calculated for quite some time.   \n \nTRGConsulting \n  EX.6 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page44 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page14 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \n \n3.  Baseline staffing should be above minimum staffing.  Due to vacancies and other factors, the Monterey \nCounty Jail constantly is using overtime to staff up to their self-imposed minimum staffing.  This level is \nnot adequate to provide basic safety and security for staff and inmates.  \n  \n4.  Vacancies, extended periods of leave, and normal staff attrition have resulted in a significant amount of \nvacant POST positions.  The jail has an increased reliance on overtime to meet minimum staffing. \n \n5.  The extensive use of overtime can be dangerous since staff may have recently completed a 12-hour shift, \nwhen they are required to work additional overtime.  Efforts must be made to reduce the number of \novertime hours.  To fill a vacancy in Monterey County, the practice has been to have an onsite employee \nwork 4 hours over his normal shift and another employee called in early for 4 hours.  This practice \nrequired two employees to work 16-hour days.  Of additional importance is the 4-hour gap that is left \nuncovered in the middle of the shift.  In an emergency situation the facility would be dangerously \nunderstaffed.  \n \n6.  Supervision is a critical task in any detention facility.  Supervisors ensure that policy is followed, tasks are \ncompleted, critical decisions are made and exposure to liability from โfailure to superviseโ claims are \nlimited.  In Monterey County, sergeants fill in for line positions when relief is unavailable.  This leaves a \ngap in first line supervision.  All vacant sergeant positions9 should be filled and, except for an unusual \nsituation, sergeants should supervise and not fill in for a line vacancy.  Even at full authorized staffing, it \nappears the span of control for sergeants is weak and additional positions for minimum supervision are \nnecessary. \n \n7.  Chronic understaffing lowers morale, employees are unable to take breaks (in violation of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act), employees get โburned outโ with mandatory overtime, employees must take โshortcutsโ to \nget the job done and employees are forced to assume collateral duties to allow the facility to function. \n \n8.  The current authorized staffing for the Monterey County Jail is woefully inadequate.  Even if every \nvacancy were filled with a fully trained staff member, the facility would not have enough staff to meet the \nminimum staffing, let alone adequate staffing.   \n \n9.  A review of the current staffing  pattern as practiced by the Monterey County Jail and the best practices \nstaffing plan included in the 2006 Staffing Analysis10 indicates that the critical needs are for the extra \nstaffing in the housing units and for facility-wide escort deputies.  These positions will ensure required \nsafety checks are made, there is some level of supervision in the kitchen, laundry and medical areas and \nadequate staffing is available to respond to emergencies and unusual situations.  Recent cuts in staffing \nhave made this situation much worse, thereby exposing the county to additional lawsuits. \n \n \nRecruitment, Selection and Retention.  The Monterey County Sheriffโs Department experiences difficulty in \nthe recruitment, selection and retention of detention officers for the following reasons. \n \nโข  Monterey County deputiesโ pay and benefits are less than those that are offered by several local, \nstate and federal agencies for similar positions. \nโข  The Custody Bureau estimates that 93% of the applicants for deputy positions in the Sheriffโs \nOffice fail the background investigation for a number of reasons including financial insolvency, \ndrug use and psychological issues. \n \nWhile the above difficulties are common in most county detention systems, the poor working conditions and \nantiquated design of the jail exacerbate Monterey County difficulties.  The feeling of draconian confinement \nand disorientation created by a maze-like layout are more than most potential applicants are willing to bear.  \n                                                        \n9   At the time of this assessment, one sergeant was out on long-term illness and one sergeant was scheduled to retire \nthis month (December 2011).  This will leave two sergeants positions vacant.  Additionally the Custody Bureau lost one \ncaptainสผs position and two commanderสผs positions in the budget cuts earlier this year (2011). \n10  Monterey County Sheriffสผs Office, Staffing Analysis.

The additional โneedโ is for a facility that protects the safety of deputies and provides \nthem with a professional environment in which to work.   \n \nH.  Ability to Provide Visual Supervision \n \nVisual Supervision.  While visual supervision is \nproblematic  in  the  existing  jail,  the  new \nMonterey  County  housing  units  will  be \ndesigned  to  enhance  visual  supervision  as \nindicated in Section B Operational and Design \nPhilosophy of this needs assessment. \n \nExisting Facility Design.  A glaring example of \nthe physical plant limitations in the existing jail \nis the design of the control or โguardโ station, \nand  the  ability  of  staff  to  directly  supervise \ninmates.    At  best  there  is  intermittent \nobservation  of  the  inmates.    In  the \nRehabilitation Facility, a Deputy Sheriff must \nwalk into the inmate housing area to see the \nentire living and shower area.  It appears there \nis an attempt to remedy the problem with the \nuse  of  cameras.    Unfortunately,  this  is  not \nworking.  Cameras should not be used in place \nTransportation van parked in front of the Monterey County \nof staff, but as a tool for staff in overall security.   \nRehabilitation Facility. \n \nNew Housing Design.  It is envisioned that the new housing units will offer direct visual supervision from unit \ncontrol into the housing pods and the attached outdoor recreation areas.  Similarly, roving officers will provide \ndirect visual supervision of all areas in all pods including the toilet and shower areas.  Partitions providing \nmodesty to inmates in the toilet area and the showers will be designed so that inmateโs heads and feet always \nare visible.  There will be no blind corners in the housing pods when observed by the roving officers. \n \nI.  Adequacy of Record Keeping \n \nRecord Keeping.  Record keeping at the Monterey County Jail is quite detailed.  Not only does jail staff \nmaintain all records required by Title 15, but they also keep additional records to effectively manage the \ninmate population.  Examples include the detailed records relating to overcrowding and early release, inmate \nmanagement records, information on inmates with mental health needs and logs of those on psychotropic \nmedications,  statistics  on  gang  affiliation,  historic  needs  assessments  and  records  relating  to  the \neffectiveness of programs (including records of the effectiveness of alternatives to incarceration). \n \nJ.  Compliance with Standards \n \nExisting Conditions.  The Monterey County Sheriffโs Office operates a Type II adult detention facility. The \nfacility is used for the detention of males and females pending arraignment, during trial, and upon a sentence \nof commitment. This facility has a unique physical plant design that complies with minimum standards for \nlocal adult detention facilities.  The facilityโs four main housing areas and reception area have a Corrections \nStandards Authority (CSA)  rated capacity of 825 inmates.  On any given day,  there can be as many as 1,000 \ninmates in custody.  The existing Monterey County Jail faces three significant issues affecting the success of \nits overall mission and the ability of the Sheriffโs Office to comply with Title 15 and Title 24 standards: \n \n1. poor facility design; \n2. severe overcrowding; and \n3. understaffing. \n \nTRGConsulting \n  EX.8 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page46 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page16 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \n \nPoor Facility Design.  The Monterey County Jail is located at 1414 Natividad Road, Salinas, California. The \noriginal rehabilitation facility was built in 1970 with additions to the jail complex occurring in 1977, 1988, 1993,  \nand 1995. Adult male and female inmates are housed in the facility. The Corrections Standards Authority has \ngiven the facility a rated capacity of 825 inmates. This facility has some physical plant limitations that are \ncauses for concern in terms of the safety and security of staff, visitors, volunteers and inmates. \n \nA common thread through all of the four main housing units is the use of the dormitory design. Dormitories \nare much like military barracks, as opposed to single cell or four-man cellblocks. Dormitories are cheaper to \nbuild and theoretically are more cost effective to supervise.  Normally, dormitories are for the lowest level of \nclassification.  In Monterey County, the jail facility has approximately 80% dormitory beds. The conflict occurs \nbecause the Monterey County regularly incarcerates approximately 80% felony sentenced and unsentenced \ninmates.  These are usually the highest level of inmate classification and require single and double cell \nhousing.  Jail staff does not have the ability to classify or segregate problem inmates from other inmates or \nstaff. \n \nThe type of inmate entering local county jails has changed dramatically since the Monterey County Jail \nopened in 1970.  Courts are releasing non-threatening felons prior to trial.  Judges are sentencing more \nmisdemeanants to alternatives to custody.  The jail is left with serious felons awaiting trial and sentenced \nfelons awaiting transportation to the state prison system.  In some ways, the local jail population is no different \nthan those in state prisons.  Local jail populations will become even more similar to state prison populations \nas the full impact of AB 109 is felt.  The design of the housing units at the Monterey County Jail was never \nintended to house the type of felony inmates it now holds or the type of inmates that will be held as mandated \nrecently by AB 109. \n \nOvercrowding.  The Corrections Standards Authority (CSA) inspects and rates the Monterey County Jail.  \nRated capacity means the number of inmate occupants for which a facilityโs single and double occupancy \ncells or dormitories (except those dedicated for health care or disciplinary isolation housing) were planned \nand  designed  in  conformity  to  the  standards  and  requirements  contained  in  the  California  Code  of \nRegulations, Title 15 and Title 24.  The entire Monterey County Jail facility is rated at 825 inmates. As \ndiscussed  earlier,  there  can  be  as  many  as  1,000  inmates  in  custody  at  any  given  time.  There  are \napproximately 13,500 inmates booked into the Monterey County Jail a year. \n \nOvercrowding  creates  a  number  of  issues  that  affect  staff  and  inmates,  and  put  the  County  at  risk.  \nOvercrowding causes stress both on inmates and staff. Inmates vs. inmate assaults typically occur more \nfrequently, as do other disciplinary infractions.  Overcrowding affects inmatesโ mental and physical health by \nincreasing the level of uncertainty with which they regularly cope.  There is less space per inmate.  In \nMonterey County there is the possibility of misclassifying inmates based on space rather than security level.  \n(Anecdotal information from staff indicates this occurs occasionally.)  Overcrowding reduces the ability to \nclassify.  This is further compounded by the dormitory design.  Normally, 10% - 15% of the beds should be \nempty and available for classification spikes as well as routine and emergency maintenance.  With the severe \novercrowding in the Monterey County Jail, programming is little, to nonexistent. \n \nUnderstaffing.  The Monterey County Jail is facing many staff related issues.  These issues affect the overall \nsecurity of the facility and the morale of the staff. \n \nAs discussed in detail in Section G, Adequacy of Staffing Levels, detention facilities must be staffed 24 hours \na day, 7 days a week (24/7) in order to fulfill their mandate to provide safe and secure housing for those \ninmates under their care.  Staff within the Monterey County Jail must be available to receive new bookings in \nthe jail, provide medical care, classify and move inmates within the facility, maintain staff and inmate safety \nand security, provide recreation and exercise, ensure inmates are fed, transport inmates to court or outside \nagencies, and lawfully release inmates.  Due to its nature, a jail cannot simply discontinue operation (e.g. \nrefuse to accept prisoners) if there is not a person available to fill a position.  When detention facilities are not \nstaffed adequately, overtime is necessary to cover an unfilled post. \n \nTRGConsulting \n  EX.9 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page47 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page17 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \n \nK.  Unresolved Issues \n \nUnresolved Issues.  Six issues remain unresolved, mostly due to the uncertainty surrounding the final impact \nof AB 109 (Criminal Justice Alignment) as modified by AB 117 (Criminal Justice Realignment) on the \nMonterey County criminal justice system.  Unresolved issues include: \n \n1.  The impact of Phase II of the Public Safety and Offender Rehabilitation Services Act of 2007 on Monterey \nCounty. \n2.  The final impact of AB 109 (as modified by AB 117) on the Monterey County criminal justice system. \n3.  Sources of funding for the construction, project and operational costs that are associated with meeting the \nprojected bed need for 2020 and 2030; \n4.

Elements of the System \n \nExisting  Monterey  County  Jail.  \nThe  Monterey  County  Jail  is \nlocated at 1410 Natividad Road, \nSalinas, California 93906.

The \nadditional beds required (including \nthe existing 825 beds) using the \naverage and high projections1 are \ndiscussed below. \n  Monterey County Jail \n \nExisting Jail Bed Capacity.

When the 825 existing beds are considered, the additional bed \nrequirements for 2020 through 2040 using the average projection are illustrated in Table A.2 below. \n \nTable A.2 \nAdult Detention Facility Additional Bed Need 2020 - 2040 (Average) \n \nYear  Additional Beds Needed \n2020  1,727 Beds \n2030  2,008 Beds \n2040 2,307 Beds\n  Source.

Alternatively, if the high projection is used, the current maximum capacity \nof only 825 beds requires that the county construct an additional 2,181 beds to meet the 2030 bed need.

TRGConsulting.  December 2011. \n \n \nThe table above indicates that to meet the 2030 need, an additional 2,181 beds will need to be \nconstructed between now and 2030. \n \nUrgent Service Gap in the Adult Criminal Justice System.  The most urgent service gap is the need for a new \ndetention beds and additional staff.  The current combination of insufficient beds, an inadequate detention \nfacility and understaffing has resulted in an almost untenable situation.  This service gap is illustrated by the \nfollowing. \n \n(cid:1)  There are not enough beds to meet the current adult detention needs, let alone the needs in the near \nfuture.  Worse, the county has the wrong type of beds for the population currently incarcerated.  As \nan example, over 75% of the beds are in dormitories; while over 80% of the inmates are felons. The \nfacility was designed for minimum and low medium-security inmates while the bulk of the inmates \ncurrently held are medium and maximum-security inmates.  This situation is exacerbated by AB 109 \nas modified by AB 117, which requires counties to house selected inmates who previously were \nhoused by the state.  If additional beds are not constructed, criminals who should be incarcerated will \nnot be incarcerated since beds space will not be available. Criminals serving time will serve little or \nnone of their time since the beds to which they are assigned will be needed for others who pose a \ngreater danger to public safety.  An extensive and unpopular early release system (i.e. releasing \ninmates well before their full sentence is served) will be required to prevent even more severe \novercrowding.3 \n(cid:1)  Overcrowding, the lack of adequate staff and an insufficient number of single and double cells has \nresulted in the necessity of classifying inmates primarily by gang affiliation.  While gang membership \ntypically is one of the factors used in classifying inmates, it is not normally the primary consideration.  \nExisting court decisions allow for segregation by race and gangs only as a โtemporary measuresโ \nwhen classification by race is necessary to allow staff to get the facility under control. \n(cid:1)  Officer safety is compromised by the severe lack of an adequate number of single and double cells. \n(cid:1)  The jail is so overcrowded that no allowance can be made for peaking and classification or the routine \nor emergency maintenance required in inmate housing areas. \n(cid:1)  Severe overcrowding has resulted in inmates being held in the intake area for up to forty-eight hours.  \nThis is not permitted by the California Code of Regulations. \n(cid:1)  Severe overcrowding has forced the Sheriff to use areas for housing that were not designed or \nintended for that use (e.g. the rotunda area). This makes these areas much more difficult for officers \nto manage and control. \n(cid:1)  Overcrowding has forced the Sheriff to operate the jail as an indirect supervision facility, while the jail \nwas designed for direct supervision.  This creates significant command, control and management \nproblems. \n                                                        \n3   The jail population regularly exceeds 1,000 inmates in a facility rated at 825.  Overcrowding already has reached a \ndangerous level. \nTRGConsulting \n  A.2 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page50 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page20 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \n \n(cid:1)  Adequate  separation  and  segregation  resulting  from  the  classification  of  inmates  cannot  occur \nbecause of the severe overcrowding and the lack of a sufficient number of single and double cells.  \nThus, while the staff has the ability to classify, they do not have the ability to physically segregate \nthose inmates who should be separated because of their classification.  This creates an environment \nthat is unsafe for officers, inmates and visitors. \n(cid:1)  The design of the jail and the manner in which additions have been constructed results in a physical \nplant that is difficult to manage and control and unnecessarily expensive to operate.  Numerous blind \nspots and the labyrinth like design requires more staff than would be required in a state-of-the-art \npodular facility.  There is poor observation from most deputy stations.  Officers cannot observe inmate \nareas in Pods A through J.  The wing walls in the dormitories are approximately four feet high and \nprovide a number of areas where inmates cannot be observed. \n(cid:1)  The manner in which additions have been constructed has resulted in a facility that lacks any real \ncentral control or command post that would be used in the event of a major disturbance or disaster.  \nThe  existence  of  multiple  control  stations  is  unnecessarily  staff  intensive  in  facility  that  is \nunderstaffed. \n(cid:1)  The age of the building systems in the sections of the jail constructed prior to 1993 require extensive \nmaintenance and, as a result, these systems are more expensive to operate.  Maintenance costs \nalready are increasing and will continue to increase at a faster rate as the facility deteriorates. \n(cid:1)  The older design of the cells and dormitories constructed prior to 1993 does not meet todayโs \nstandards for state-of-the-art detention facilities.  Examples include: \n \nโ  Suicide hazard elimination is not as stringent as it should be to prevent self-harm and the \nattendant liability. \nโ  Medical/mental health treatment spaces are not adequate for the rated beds, let alone the actual \nnumber of inmates held.4 \nโ  Preferred design requirements to improve security and the management of inmates are not met \n(e.g. number of toilet fixtures and showers per inmate, number of safety and sobering cells \nneeded for efficient operation, adequate intake and release facilities, sufficient storage, etc.). \nโ  There are insufficient spaces dedicated to programs.  Effective programs are necessary to \nmanage the jail population and reduce recidivism. \nโ  Overcrowding forces the entire facility to operate as an indirect supervision jail.  Mental health \nissues are considerably more difficult to recognize, manage and treat in an indirect supervision \nfacility.  A direct supervision, podular design in which staff is able to interact continuously with \ninmates makes it significantly easier to detect inmates with mental health problems.  Additionally \na direct supervision model reduces conflict and allows better observation of those requiring \ntreatment. \n \nโข  Understaffing has resulted in insufficient staff coverage.  This all too frequently results in a four-hour \ngap in the middle of twelve-hour shifts.  At times the middle of a shift may be as many as three or four \nofficers short.  This has been exacerbated by recent staff reductions.5  As a result there are not \nenough officers present in the jail to respond to a major crisis or natural disaster.6 \n                                                        \n4   For example, it is estimated that at least fifteen to twenty percent of the inmate population have mental health issues. \n5   In January 2011 there were 220 personnel in the Custody Bureau (Sworn and Unsworn).  The recent budget cuts \n($6.4 million in the Sheriffโs Office) have reduced Custody Bureau staff to 183 people assigned, a reduction of thirty-\nseven positions in a facility that already was woefully understaffed.  All vacant positions were eliminated in the most \nrecent budget cuts.  Finally, on December 13, 2011, the Board of Supervisors approved twelve new civilian (non-\nsworn) hires to replace deputies serving in unit control stations.  This will make those deputies serving in control \navailable to work in the jail.  The twelve deputies now serving in control then will be available for other duties in the jail.  \nThe civilian hires are expected to be trained and on duty in February 2012.  Thus the net loss of jail personnel since \nJanuary 2011 is twenty-five positions.  Unfortunately the net loss includes a Captainโs position and two Commanderโs \npositions. \n6   Staff in the jail work twelve-hour shifts.  When insufficient staff is available for a particular shift for whatever reason, the \nSheriff is forced to hold over staff from the previous shift for four hours and bring in staff from the following shift four \nhours early.  This results in a four-hour gap in the shift that is short of staff.  Worse, this results in some officers \nworking sixteen-hour shifts. \nTRGConsulting \n  A.3 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page51 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page21 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \n \nโข  Understaffing has resulted in the extensive use of CCTV cameras to monitor inmate activities.  CCTV \nnever can substitute for officer presence. \nโข  The attrition rate of trained detention officers is quite high.7 \nโข  Because of understaffing, the Sheriff is forced to use pre-academy hires in the jail. \nโข  Understaffing has increased the span of control for first line supervisors to an unacceptable level. \nโข  Sergeants are sometimes forced to work line positions because of lack of staff.  This results in a lack \nof supervision of the staff in the jail. \nโข  There are insufficient staff on some shifts to make the required safety checks. \nโข  Reduced staffing makes it difficult for staff to supervise inmates in the kitchen and the laundry. \nโข  Staff shortages have resulted in the excessive use of overtime. \n \n \nIdentified Need.  As discussed above, additional beds urgently need to be constructed at the Natividad site.  \nThe Monterey County Jail will remain a Type II Facility (i.e. a local detention facility used for the detention of \npersons pending arraignment, during trial and upon sentence of commitment as defined in Title 24 of the \nCalifornia Code of Regulations). \n \nHousing (Average Projections).  To begin to meet 2030 needs using the average projections in Table A.2, \n2,008 beds will need to be added to the existing 825 beds as described below. Housing will be designed as \n192-bed units (each with two, 96-bed pods) to provide adequate control and to maximize staffing efficiency.  \nThe allocation of new beds using the average projections is summarized in Table A.4 below. \n \n \nTable A.4 \nAdditional Bed Allocation 2030 (Average) \n \nBed Type  New \nConstruction \nSingle Cells  42 \nDouble Cells  1,966 \nDormitory Beds  0 \nTotal Beds  2,008 \nSource.

A total of 45 new beds in single occupancy cells for maximum-security, disciplinary \nsegregation, administrative segregation and protective custody inmates will be added to the system.  All cells \nwill be โwet.โ  Stainless steel combination fixtures will be used.  All cell doors will be hung doors constructed \nof steel.  One bed and a desk will be wall mounted. \n \nDouble Occupancy Cells.  A total of 2,136 new beds will be in 1,068 double occupancy cells for medium-\nsecurity inmates.  Adequate ADA cells will be provided.  All cells will be โwet.โ  Stainless steel combination \nfixtures will be used.  All cell doors will be hung doors constructed of steel.  Two beds and two desks will be \nwall mounted. \n \nDayrooms.  Dayrooms will be provided at the rate of thirty-five square feet per inmate and will contain \nanchored tables and seating to accommodate the maximum number of inmates allowed access to the \ndayroom at any given time in each housing unit.  Access will be provided to toilets, washbasins, drinking \nfountains and showers from the dayroom.  Dining will occur in the dayroom of each housing unit. \n \nVisiting.  Contact, non-contact and video visiting spaces will be provided. \n \nProgram Space.  Program rooms will be provided at each housing unit.  Activities that will occur in these \nspaces include adult education, religious services and counseling, Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics \nAnonymous classes, group counseling, mental health evaluations and classes along with other programs to \nreduce recidivism.  Additional program space will be provided for the existing rated beds. \n \nMedical and Mental Health Services.  Medical examination rooms and secure pharmaceutical storage will \ncontinue to be provided for medical screening and routine medical care.  More advanced care will continue to \nbe provided outside of the facility.  Mental health professionals will evaluate inmates and provide mental \nhealth programs as necessary.  Interview rooms and program space will be provided for this purpose. \n \nOutdoor Exercise.  An enclosed, secure outdoor exercise area will be attached to each new housing unit.  \nThis area will be observable from within the housing unit and from central control.  The area will be a secure \narea that is partially covered for use in inclement weather and have a clear height of at least fifteen feet.  The \nโopenโ area of the roof structure will be covered with high security mesh to prevent escape.  Access will be \nprovided to a toilet, washbasin and drinking fountain. \n \nThere will be at least one completely fenced outdoor exercise area of not less than 600 square feet for use by \nthose inmates who have earned this privilege. \n \nSpecial care will be taken to eliminate opportunities for escape and the introduction of contraband.

Selected non-contact visiting rooms will be configured with a secure and lockable \npaper pass to allow attorneys to consult confidentially with inmate clients.   \n \nConfidential Interview Rooms.  Confidential interview rooms will be provided near the new housing areas.  \nThe interview rooms will be used by custody, mental health and health care staff as well as by attorneys and \nreligious advisors.  The interview rooms will be accessible to male and female inmates and they will not be \nmonitored. \n \nCentral Control.  A new central control room will monitor and operate all security perimeter penetrations.  \nAdditionally central control will monitor each new and existing housing unit. \n \nCentral control will have visual supervision of the housing units, the attached outdoor exercise areas and the \nprogram spaces.  CCTV will be used to provide visual control and to assist in the control of the perimeter \npenetrations.  Central control will function as the Sheriffโs command post during natural disasters or inmate \ndisturbances. \n \nUnit Control.  New unit control stations capable of visually controlling a unit and will be located between \nhousing pods. \n \nA new integrated control system will link all existing housing areas to the new construction. \n \nStaff Positions.  A draft staffing plan will be prepared before the facility is designed.  Thus, care will be taken \nduring the design to be certain that the facility does not generate additional staff positions not required by \nโbest practice.โ  All staff stations will be ergonomically designed. \n \nFood Service.  The existing food service operation will accommodate the additional beds. \n \nInmates will be fed in the dayrooms of their respective housing units.  Sack lunches will be provided for \ninmates who are away from the facility for the day (e.g. on work crews, inmates likely to be in court for the \nday, etc.). \n \nStorage.  Institutional storage will be provided as required by Title 24.  Additionally, storage areas will be \nprovided in the new housing units.  Inmate property storage will be provided.  The inmate property storage \narea will include secure storage for inmate valuables. \n \n \nBed Need Remains Paramount.  Although the Monterey County detention facilities have a CSA rated capacity \nof 825 beds, it must be remembered that all but 153 of the rated beds are dormitory beds.  Even at the 825 \nbed rated capacity the Sheriff regularly incarcerates over 1,000 inmates.  This results in an immediate \nshortage of 175 beds but, more importantly, a shortage of approximately 850 beds of the bed type needed to \nhouse the felons currently incarcerated as well as those that will be incarcerated as a result of AB 109 (i.e. \nbeds in single and double cells). \n \nThere also is a need for additional and/or remodeled administration and support spaces to operate an efficient \nCustody Bureau.  Once the Sheriff is comfortable that enough of the available resources are devoted to beds, \nhe should then address the administration and support needs.10 \n \nThe county and their planner have determined that there also is an immediate need for a minimum of 5,000 \nsq. ft. of relocated administrative space to improve the flow of inmate induction and visitor control.  This \nrelocation is required in Phase 1 to prepare for the construction of future housing units. \n                                                        \n10  Please note that additional beds require specific support spaces (e.g. increased storage, recreation areas, etc.) as \noutlined in Title 24.  These mandatory support spaces must be included in any project that increases the rated bed \ncapacity. \nTRGConsulting \n  A.6 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page54 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page24 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \n \nB.  Operational and Design Philosophy \n \nIntroduction.  The purposes and goals for the Monterey County Adult \nDetention and Rehabilitation Facilities are discussed in the Monterey \nCounty Sheriffโs Manual in Section 1101.00 Bureau Organization. \n \n \nPurpose.  The purpose of the Monterey County Adult Detention and \nRehabilitation Facilities is the detention of persons charged with crimes \nand awaiting arraignment or trial. \n \n1.   The detention of persons, in the Sheriffโs custody, to ensure their \nattendance as witnesses in criminal cases. \n \n2.   The  confinement  of  persons  sentenced  to  imprisonment  in  the \nCounty Facilities.1 \n \nGoal.  By means of the continuing process of education and training of \nMonterey County Rehabilitation \nthe deputies and professional staff employed herein, to provide for the \nFacility Entrance. \nsecurity, health and welfare of inmates in custody and to rehabilitate \nthem whenever possible through programs designed for this purpose.2 \n \n \nLong Range Design Goals for New Adult Detention Beds and Support Spaces.  The immediate design goal is \nto maximize the number of new detention beds in cells at the current site, using existing support infrastructure \nand administrative space as much as possible.  The specific design objectives for the new adult detention \nbeds and support space are discussed in detail in the body of this assessment. \n \nโข  be a state-of-the-art, new generation, direct visual supervision, podular, adult detention facility that \nmeets all of the requirements of Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations; \nโข  provide a safe and secure environment for staff, visitors, volunteers and adults with a well defined \nsecure perimeter that includes pedestrian and vehicular sally ports; \nโข  include a new central control station that controls the secure perimeter and has visual supervision of \nthe housing units and recreation areas as well as other secure areas; \nโข  Include unit control stations to supervise the new housing pods; \nโข  consist of housing units with the flexibility to meet a wide variety of varying classification needs (e.g. \nmental health housing units, female housing units, special needs housing units, units of varying \nsecurity levels, etc.); \nโข  meet Monterey Countyโs adult detention requirements for twenty years after initial occupancy (with \nplanned expansion); \nโข  provide spaces for a wide variety of programs to reduce recidivism and thus reduce county, state and \nfederal criminal justice system costs; \nโข  provide a professional work environment and adequate space for custody staff, teachers, medical and \nmental health professionals, other professionals providing services and volunteers; \nโข  be cost efficient to build and operate; \nโข  be energy efficient and environmentally friendly to reduce operating costs; \nโข  be staff efficient to preserve county resources; \nโข  include  intake/release/processing  areas  that  are  large  enough  to  meet  all  booking  needs  and, \nsimultaneously, provide an area for release and transportation staging (intake/release/ processing \nspaces often are undersized in detention facilities); \nโข  provide adequate medical, dental and mental health spaces to reduce the need for transportation \noutside the facility and to ensure that each inmate is evaluated, treated, monitored and assigned to \nappropriate programs; \n                                                        \n1  Monterey County Sheriff(cid:1)s Manual, Section 1101.03 A.

The construction and administrative work plan for the new adult \ndetention facility is discussed below. \n \nThe delivery process is designed specifically to make the most efficient use of available resources while \nachieving the project scope (quality), budget and schedule.  This methodology has been used successfully on \nseveral adult detention facility projects throughout the United States including projects in California counties \nand projects under the aegis of state and federal grant managers. \n \nThis work plan includes proven project delivery methods to ensure successful completion of the proposed \nscope on time and within budget.  The plan also includes federally mandated requirements for grant funding.  \nThe plan consists of the following elements: \n \n(cid:1)  Detailed conceptual level planning that includes: \n \nโ  information on and required by funding sources including the monitoring of matching funds;3 \nโ  development of the preliminary program statement;4 \nโ  development of the preliminary staffing plan;5 \nโ  development of the preliminary architectural program;

Over the last decade, violent felony reports and arrests according to statistics maintained by the \nCalifornia Department of Justice have fluctuated; therefore a predictable upward or downward trend has not \noccurred.  Unfortunately the number of beds available for holding these offenders has been well below the \nnumber and type needed throughout that timeframe.  As a result, the classification and segregation of \ninmates is extremely difficult given the type of beds available to house them.  This places staff, visitors and \ninmates in the facility at risk of injury or death.  With an insufficient number of maximum and medium-security \nbeds the staff must choose the โleast violentโ of the violent offenders to house in minimum-security dormitory \nbeds since there are no medium-security double cells.  It is obvious that the system is dangerously out of \nbalance in terms of the types of beds available and the classification of inmates held. \n \n \nTRGConsulting \n  C.2 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page60 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page30 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT  \n \n \nD.  Classification of Inmates \n \nIntroduction.  The proper classification of inmates is \ncritical in the Monterey County Jail because of the age \nof the facility and the lack of enough single and double \ncells to properly separate and segregate inmates.  The \nnumber of violent gang members currently held at the \nexisting adult detention facility further exacerbates the \ndifficulty in classification.  Classification officers classify \nprimarily by gang affiliation because of insufficient staff, \ninadequate facilities and sever overcrowding. \n \nIn  Monterey  County  there  is  the  possibility  of \nmisclassifying  inmates  based  on  space  rather  than \nsecurity  level.    Overcrowding  reduces  the  ability  to \nclassify.  This is further compounded by the dormitory \ndesign.  Normally, 10% - 15% of the beds should be \nempty  and  available  for  classification  spikes  and \nThe Monterey County Main Jail. \nmaintenance.   \n \nClassification Training.  A majority of the classification training for staff is performed in house. \n \nClassification of Inmates. The countyโs classification system is explained in the verbiage below from the \nMonterey County Sheriffโs Manual. \n \n1110.00  INMATE CLASSIFICATION \n \n1110.01  Receiving Deputies are responsible for the initial classification and housing of inmates.  They \nshall use information in CJIS to assess the inmateโs classification history.  This shall include \ninmateโs current charges, past custody record, gang affiliation and criminal history.  Deputies \nshall use the following guidelines for assigning housing.  They may also use the on duty \nClassification Deputy as a resource in classifying inmates. \n \nA.  The different levels of security and inmate classification categories shall be determined as \nfollows.  These categories shall require maximum-security housing at initial housing. \n \n1.   Protective Custody - Inmates that need to be housed separately because they are in \ndanger of being assaulted by other inmates because of their charge, gang affiliation, \nsexual preference, occupation, or inmate informants. \n \n2.   Violently Assaultive or Predatory Behavior - Inmates that are prone to assaultive or \nthreatening behavior toward other inmates or staff.  Inmates that are found to be in \npossession of deadly weapons while in custody.  Inmates that have an extensive criminal \nhistory of violence and assaults on peace officers. \n \n3.   Escape Risk - Inmates that have escaped or attempted to escape from custody to include \nparticipation in any escape or possession of escape tools.  Inmates that have been \nsentenced to or are pending sentence to death or life in prison shall be considered an \nescape risk. \n \n4.   Violent or Serious Criminal Charges - Inmates that are charged with murder, attempted \nmurder, kidnapping, aggravated assault and sex crimes.  This may include inmates that \nhave a past history of these charges even if currently in custody on lesser charges. \n \n5.   Sophisticated Criminal History - Inmates that have been found in possession of prison \nweapons or are sophisticated gang members. \nTRGConsulting \n  D.1 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page61 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page31 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT  \n \n \n6.   State/Federal Prison Inmates - Inmates held locally for court proceedings that have holds \nfrom federal or state prisons. \n \n7.   Uncooperative Attitude - Inmates that display an anti-establishment and uncooperative \nbehavior. \n \n8.   Exhibiting Behavior that Fits the Criteria of 5150 W&I or Diagnosed Mental Illness - \nInmates that are a danger to themselves or others, unable to care for themselves or have \nbeen diagnosed with psychological problems.  Referral to medical staff for treatment and \nclearance for housing is required. \n \n9.   Under the Influence of Psychedelic Drugs - P.C.P., L.S.D., or other hallucinogenic drugs \nor mind-altering drugs. \n \nB.   The following categories may be housed in medium security general housing. \n \n1.   Misdemeanor and General Felony Charges - Inmates that are charged with misdemeanor \nand felony charges that are not violent and assaultive in nature.  Inmates that can adapt \nto the jail setting and adjust to the open housing setting.  This category includes inmates \nsentenced to county jail waiting classification clearance for minimum security.   \n \nC.   The following categories of inmates shall be housed in minimum security. \n \n1.   Inmates sentenced to county jail. \n \n2.   Inmates who can adapt to an open housing environment.   \n \n3.   Inmates that can participate in work details and correctional programs. \n \nD.  Processing and Housing Civil Prisoners. \n \n1.   Any person committed to jail on a civil charge (civil contempt of court, failure to abide by \na court order, etc.) shall be housed in a single cell away from the general population.  \nThey shall be dressed out in a WHITE jumpsuit. \n \n2.   Priority shall be given to assigning all civil commitments to the Isolation Cells in the Menโs \nSection and Holding Cells in the Womenโs Section. \n \n3.   The  Receiving  Deputy  shall  make  the  cell  assignment  with  the  assistance  of \nClassification or the Watch Supervisor.  In the event that no isolation cell is available, a \ntemporary assignment in Booking can be made.  The civil inmate shall be moved to an \nisolation cell at the earliest possible time. \n \n4.   A civil prisoner cannot be offered the option of being housed in general population.   \n \n1110.02  Facility Housing Levels \n \nA.  The different levels of security such as minimum, medium, and maximum are based on \ncharge, past criminal history, and current and past conduct in custody.  The different housing \nunits in the facility fall into the following security categories. \n \n1.   Maximum โ Isolation Cells, A-Pod, B-Pod, C-Pod, D-Pod, G-Pod, H-Pod, I-Pod, J-Pod, \nWomenโs Holding Cells, R-Pod, and S-Pod. \n \n2.   Medium โ E-Pod, F-Pod, Rotunda, K-Pod, Dorm-A, Dorm-B, Dorm-C, Dorm-D, B-Wing, \nC-Wing, T-Pod, and U-Pod. \nTRGConsulting \n  D.2 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page62 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page32 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT  \n \n \n3.

Male prisoners shall be confined separately from female prisoners. \n \n2.   Persons confined on civil charges shall be kept separate from those confined on criminal \ncharges. \n \n3.   Juvenile inmates shall be kept separate from adult inmates. \n \nC.   Following is a list of housing units and a description of the types of inmates housed in each \nunit.  Deputies shall use these categories to correctly house inmates.  Inmates shall not be \nhoused directly into the dorms without review by the Classification Deputies or approval of \nthe Team Commander. \nTable D.1 \nInmate Classification \nRevised 09/06 \n \nARMBAND  CLOTHING \nMain Jail  TYPE OF HOUSING \nCOLOR  COLOR \nA-POD  Adm. segregation, 5150, incompatible sex crimes  GREEN   ORANGE  \nB-POD  Adm. segregation, 5150, incompatible sex crimes  GREEN   ORANGE  \nAdm. segregation for heavy Surenos1 and compatible \nC-POD \ninmates  ORANGE   ORANGE  \nD-POD  Adm.

Proper separation and \nsegregation of inmates as envisioned in the Sheriffโs classification plan is very difficult because of insufficient \nstaff, an inadequate physical plant layout and the severe overcrowding that makes it necessary to unofficially \nadd  well  over  300  beds  above  the  CSA  rated  capacity.    These  problems  can  be  alleviated  with  the \nconstruction of new housing or a new facility properly sized to meet future needs.

Programs \n \nIntroduction.  The existing Monterey County Jail \nlacks adequate space to conduct any kind of \nmeaningful  programs  to  reduce  recidivism.  \nWorse, the sever overcrowding and insufficient \nstaff make it almost impossible for the Sheriff to \nconduct any but the most basic programs (e.g. \nreligious services and counseling, basic mental \nhealth  programs  and  counseling,  visiting, \ncommissary,  counseling  by  health  care \nproviders, Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics \nAnonymous classes, etc.). \n \nNew detention housing with adequate program \nspace will allow for a wide variety of programs to \nreduce  recidivism.    Not  only  will  the  Sheriffโs \nOffice be able to enhance existing programs, but \nstaff also will be able to introduce a number of \nsuccessful programs in other jurisdictions.   \nDormitory  housing  in  the  Rehabilitation  Facility  at  the \n \nMonterey County Jail.

The \nSheriffโs Office meets with the Presiding Judge at the end of each month to obtain a 5-day early release \n(or 10% of sentence, ten days through fifty days release) under PC Section 4024.1. \nTRGConsulting \n  E.34 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page100 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page70 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT  \n \n \nโข  Since October 2011, the Sheriffโs Office has revamped the Release on Own Recognizance (OR) program \nto include first time felons for 10851 VC, 11350 H.S., Penal Code Section 487 and few other non-\nviolent/non-serious crimes.  This results in a savings of an average of 200 days per month during which a \nperson waiting for arraignment normally would occupy a bed.  This is to compensate somewhat for the \ninflux of AB 109 inmates. \nPrevention of the Disproportionate Confinement of Minority Populations.  The Monterey County Sheriffโs \nOffice formally monitors the entire continuum of services to be certain that minority populations are not treated \ndifferently in any respect.  Specifically, proactive steps have been taken for the last ten years to be certain \nthat there is not a disproportionate confinement of minorities.  This is accomplished by assuring that minority \npopulations receive the maximum possible benefits from all of the services in the continuum.  Monitoring \noccurs during quarterly meetings of senior staff at which time statistics relating to the confinement of \nminorities are reviewed in great detail.  Adjustments are made when necessary. \n \nTRGConsulting \n  E.35 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page101 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page71 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \nF.  Analysis of Local Trends and Characteristics. \n \nIntroduction.  This section is an analysis of local trends and characteristics that influence planning \nassumptions about future detention system growth.  Different factors that influence change, including \nprojected population increases (including those associated with AB 109), current and projected inmate \npopulations and program costs based on continuation of current policies are measured.  Projections of \nalternative policies or programs on inmate population growth and program costs, as well as observed \nfactors that could affect the level of criminal activity in the jurisdiction including trends in felony and \nmisdemeanor arrests and trends in average daily populations of detention facilities. \n \nThese population indicators will assist in determining the design, security level (i.e. minimum-security, \nmedium-security,  maximum-security,  disciplinary  segregation,  administration  segregation  and \nprotective custody) and type of detention beds required in a new or expanded facility.  Discussions of \nthe impact of alternative policies or programs on inmate population growth and program costs point \ntoward exploring alternative methods to control and manage offender populations.1 \n \nProjection of Average Daily Population (ADP).  The purpose of these projections is to forecast the \naverage daily population (ADP) for Monterey County adult detention for calendar years 2020, 2030, \n2040 and 2050.  This will allow the determination of future adult detention facility beds needs. \n \nA.  The following information is available from Monterey County Jail records for calendar years \n2008 through 2010: \n \n1.)  Detention days per calendar year; \n2.)  Average Daily Population (ADP); and \n3.)  Average Length of Stay (ALS). \n \nB.  The following summaries were prepared from the available data: \n \n1.)  Annual number of admissions to the Monterey County Jail from 2008 through 2010 are \nshown on the following table. \n \nTable F.1 \nAdmissions 2008 โ 2010 \n \nYear Admissions\n2008 14,155\n2009 13,515\n2010 13,266\nSource:  Monterey County Sheriff's Office, Custody Operations Bureau.  November 2011.\n \n \n2.)  Number  of  detention  days  (person-days)2 served  in  the  Monterey  County  Jail  (pre-\nsentenced and sentenced) from 2008 to 2010 (illustrated in Table F.2 on the next page). \n \n                                                        \n1  Please see Section E. Programs. \n2  Annual detention days equal the total number of days served in detention by all of the inmates detained during \nthat year.  If inmate #1 serves four days in the detention facility, inmate #2 serves six days and inmate #3 \nserves five days, then the inmates combined served a total of fifteen detention days.  The number of days \nserved by any inmate during the calendar year is equal to the number of days that elapsed between his or her \ndate of admission and their date of release.  If an inmate was received before the start of the year, the annual \nnumber of days that they serve is measured from the beginning of the year to the date of release.  If an inmate \nis received, but not released by the end of the year, the annual number of days that they serve is measured \nfrom the date of admission to the end of the year.  AB 109 admissions were estimated using court records. \nTRGConsulting  F.1 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page102 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page72 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \n \nTable F.2 \nDetention Days 2008 - 2010 \n \nYear Detention Days\n2008 593,095\n2009 633,923\n2010 564,642\nSource:  Monterey County Sheriff's Office, Custody Operations Bureau.

Once this range in the rate of probable admissions per unit of population has \nbeen estimated, then the number of future admissions can be estimated by multiplying these \nratios  (low,  median,  average  and  high)  by  the  projected  population  of  the  service  area \n(Monterey County) as determined from data provided by the Demographic Research Unit of \nthe California Department of Finance. \n \nC.  The projected number of adult offender admissions in the future to the Monterey County Adult \nDetention Facility (assuming a continuation of present practices in the law enforcement and \njudicial systems) was determined by multiplying the forecasted Monterey County population by \nthe low, median, average and high ratios (number of adult offenders divided by the County \npopulation) as calculated from the adult offender data above. \n \n1.)

The data presented in Table F.13 above provides the baseline projection of \naverage daily population that would occur absent other factors that influence these projections.  In the \ncase of Monterey County, an additional influential factor must be considered.  Population figures used \nin the baseline projections are based on U.S. Census data that does not include unauthorized \nmigrants and an adjustment is required to account for this additional population.3   \n \nB.  Population figures used in the baseline projections are based on U.S. Census data that does \nnot include unauthorized migrants.  A percentage of increase factor is required to account for \nthis unauthorized population particularly since a large part of the unauthorized population \nresides in California.  The algorithm to estimate the percentage of increase compares the \nunauthorized migrants in California to the state population.  The formula is illustrated on the \nfollowing page. \n \n                                                        \n3  This needs assessment uses Jeffrey Passelโs term and definition of โunauthorized migrantโ to describe an \nindividual who resides in the United States, but is not a U.S. citizen, has not been admitted for permanent \nresidence and is not in a set of specific authorized temporary statuses permitting longer-term residence and \nwork.  (See Passel, Van Hook and Bean 2004 for further discussion.)  Various labels have been applied to this \ngroup of unauthorized migrants including โundocumented immigrants,โ โillegals,โ โillegal aliensโ and โillegal \nimmigrants.โ  The term โunauthorized migrantโ best encompasses this population because many migrants now \nenter the country of work using counterfeit documents and thus really are not โundocumentedโ because they \nhave documents, but not legal documents.  While many will stay permanently in the United States, unauthorized \nmigrants are more likely to leave the country than other groups (Van Hook, Passel, Zhang and Bean 2004).  \nโMigrantโ rather than โimmigrantโ is used to highlight this distinction. \nTRGConsulting  F.6 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page107 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page77 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \n2005 Unauthorized Migrant Population (California) / 2005 Estimated California Population \n \n2,750,000/37,172,015 = X \n \nX = 7.4% \n \nThis percentage of increase factor of 7.4% for unauthorized migrants should be added to the \nbaseline projections in Table F.13 above.

Finally, a peaking and classification factor is used to accommodate the \nhigher \"peaks\" in adult detention facility population and the classification of incarcerated adults. \n \nPeaks occur when bookings temporarily increase because of such occurrences as increased criminal \nor gang activity, an increase in crime after parties when adults are chemically impaired, etc.  Typically \npeaking ranges from 10% to 20% depending on the jurisdiction.  This report uses the average of 15% \nfor estimating the probable future peaking of the adult detention population. \n \nProper classification procedures require separation of inmates based on such factors as the inmateสผs \npotential for violence, gender differences, status, gang affiliation, predatory tendencies, etc.  Criminal \njustice planners typically use a classification factor of between 8% and 15%.  This report uses the \nmore conservative classification factor of 10%. \n \nIf a peaking and classification factor of 25% is added to the previous calculations, it is predicted that \nthe high projected ADP will range from 2,708 in 2020 to 3,006 beds in 2030; 3,323 beds in 2040; and \n3,674 beds in 2050.4  These results are illustrated in Tables F.16 below and Table F.17 on the \nfollowing page.

Aggregate:  TRGConsulting.  November 2011.  \n \n \n  This table summarizes the original offender data from which projections have been made.  In \nthis table the original admissions and detention days data have been converted to average \nlength of stay using the formula above.  The average length of stay ranges from 41.90 days \n(2008) to 46.91 days (2009).  Since it was shown previously that the admissions and days in \ndetention data display no apparent trend in relation to the population of Monterey County \nduring the data years, it can be assumed that any combination of the admissions and \ndetention days data might have occurred during this period.  Accordingly, the operating upper \nlimits of the length of stay can be found by pairing the highest number of detention days during \nthe data period (2009) with the lowest number of jail admissions (2010).  Similarly, the lowest \nnumber of detention days (2010) should be paired with the highest number of jail admissions \n(2008).  Substituting these paired extremes into formula an ALS algorithm results in the \nfollowing: \n \n \n2010 / 2008 =ALS Days\nLowest Average Length of Stay 564,642 / 14,155 =39.89\n2009 / 2008 =ALS Days\nHighest Average Length of Stay 633,923 / 14,155 =44.78  \n \n \n  If past practices continue and calculations include the impact of AB 109, the average length of \nstay in the Monterey County Adult Detention Facility will fall between 39.89 days and 44.78 \ndays during the projected period.  This suggests the importance of an effective and intense \naftercare component if programs are to have any long term, lasting impact that results in \nreduced recidivism. \n \n \nShortfall Using the Average Projection.

Adequacy of Staffing Levels \n \nIntroduction. The Monterey County Jail is facing a \nnumber of staff related issues.  These issues affect \nthe overall security of the facility and the morale of \nthe staff. \n \nStaffing Issues.  Detention facilities must be staffed \n24 hours a day, 7 days a week (24/7) in order to \nfulfill  their  mandate  to  provide  safe  and  secure \nhousing for those inmates under their care.  Staff \nwithin the Monterey County Jail must be available \nto receive new bookings in the jail, provide medical \ncare, classify and move inmates within the facility, \nmaintain  staff  and  inmate  safety  and  security, \nprovide  recreation  and  exercise,  ensure  inmates \nare  fed,  transport  inmates  to  court  or  outside \nagencies and lawfully release inmates.  Due to its \nnature, a jail cannot simply discontinue operation \nEighty percent of the beds at the Monterey County Jail are \n(e.g. refuse to accept prisoners) if there is not a \nin dormitories while eighty percent of the inmates are \nfelons.  person available to fill a position.  When detention \nfacilities  are  not  staffed  adequately,  overtime  is \nnecessary to cover an unfilled post. \n \nThe major staffing issues facing the Monterey County Jail are: \n \n1.  While  the  2010  inspection  report  appears  to  indicate  that  the  jail  is  staffed  adequately,  a  closer \nexamination of the report reveals that CSA staff only was commenting on the fact that required safety \nchecks were being made.1  CSA staff did not examine the staffing required to safely operate the jail in any \ndetail.  As in 2006, it still appears that the staffing provided by the County salary ordinance is based on \nthe rated capacity of the facility, not on how many inmates are actually in custody.  There has been no \nadjustment for the increase in number of inmates or the criminal sophistication of the inmate now in \ncustody. \n \n2.  There has not been an updated relief factor calculated for quite some time.  For example, employees are \ndue two 15-minute breaks away from their workstation per shift and have to be replaced by another staff \nmember.  The position cannot be left vacant.  Also, in recent years family medical leave and other factors \ncome into play that should be factored in to provide a realistic relief factor. \n \n3.  Minimum staffing is the level of staff required to operate a detention facility in a manner that will provide \nbasic safety and security for the public, staff, and inmates.  Minimum staffing levels establish a baseline \nby which detention facilities may operate, yet often times do not take into consideration the span of \ncontrol between assigned duties and the actual ability to supervise and manage inmate populations.  \nWhen a systemโs minimum staffing is precariously low, the county is exposed to potential liability because \nthis implies that basic safety and security are no longer protected.  Minimum staffing levels are influenced \nand  affected  by  various  factors  including  facility  design  and  inmate  capacity,  adequate  staffing  of \nnecessary POST positions, adequate shift relief factor, inmate profile/classification level and budget \nconstraints.  It is important to reiterate that minimum staffing is just that (i.e. minimum staffing to provide \nbasic functions).  The baseline staffing should be above minimum staffing.  Due to vacancies and other \nfactors, the Monterey County Jail is constantly using overtime to staff up to their self-imposed minimum \n                                                        \n1   For example, in the inspection report dated June 10, 2010, the following comments also relate.  โCrowding continues \nto plague the Custody Operations Bureau, which inherently raises unit tensions leading to potential increases in inmate \nassaults on other inmates and staff.  Increased exposure to litigation results in costly lawsuits.โ  The report goes on to \ndocument the overcrowding (i.e. a total of 146 inmates over rated capacity at the time of the inspection). \nTRGConsulting \n  G.1 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page113 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page83 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \n \nstaffing.  This level is not adequate to provide basic safety and security for staff and inmates.  This \nsituation will be exacerbated by the influx of AB 109 inmates. \n  \n4.  Vacancies,2  extended  periods  of  leave,  and  normal  staff  attrition  underscore  the  importance  of \nmaintaining a minimum number of staff.  Staff at the Monterey County Jail are leaving for employment at \nlocal and surrounding police departments that offer higher pay and enhanced benefits and a variety or \nother reasons.  This has caused a lower than normal experience level of staff and the use of pre-\nacademy hires.  The workforce needs to level out.  With a significant amount of vacant POST positions, \nthe jail has an increased reliance on overtime to meet minimum staffing. \n \n5.  Sheriffโs Offices often utilize overtime to cover an unfilled post.  This practice can be dangerous since \nstaff may have recently completed a 12-hour shift, when they are required to work additional overtime.  \nThere is no way for detention facilities to eliminate all use of overtime; it is a necessary component of \nstaffing a 24-hour a day, 7-day a week operation.  However, to save the Custody Bureau money and \nremove the potential for staff burnout, efforts must be made to reduce the number of overtime hours.  To \nfill a vacancy in Monterey County, the practice has been to have an onsite employee work 4 hours over \nhis normal shift and another employee called in early for 4 hours.  This practice required two employees \nto work 16-hour days.  Of additional importance is the 4-hour gap that is left uncovered in the middle of \nthe shift.3  In an emergency situation the facility would be dangerously understaffed.  An alternative would \nbe to call or order someone on regular days off to fill the entire shift on overtime whenever possible; \nhowever, this is difficult to accomplish because of the severe staff shortage. \n \n6.  Supervision is a critical task in any detention facility.  Supervisors ensure that policy is followed, tasks are \ncompleted, critical decisions are made and exposure to liability from โfailure to superviseโ claims are \nlimited.  In Monterey County, sergeants fill in for line positions when relief is unavailable.  This leaves a \ngap in first line supervision.  All vacant sergeant positions4 should be filled and, except for an unusual \nsituation, sergeants should supervise and not fill in for a line vacancy.  Even at full authorized staffing, it \nappears the span of control for sergeants is weak and additional positions for minimum supervision are \nnecessary. \n \n7.  Chronic understaffing causes a host of other issues detrimental to the mission of the jail.  It lowers \nmorale, employees are unable to take breaks (in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act), employees \nget โburned outโ with mandatory overtime, employees must take โshortcutsโ to get the job done and \nemployees are forced to assume collateral duties to allow the facility to function. \n \n8.  The current authorized staffing for the Monterey Jail is woefully inadequate.  Even if every vacancy were \nfilled with a fully trained staff member, the facility would not have enough staff to meet the minimum \nstaffing, let alone adequate staffing.  The current roster carries vacancies, employees on medical leave, \nemployees on light duty, employees on family leave and other assorted reasons for not filling a POST \nposition.  Monterey County should aggressively recruit and fill all vacant positions.  They should also \nโover hireโ Deputy Sheriffs above the authorized staffing to fill in when a vacancy occurs.  Some counties \nrefer to this as โpipelineโ hiring.  There are always people in the โsystemโ or pipeline from background \nprocessing to attending the academy.  Rarely does over hiring have a cost associated with it, but there is \nalways cost avoidance for overtime when a vacancy occurs and a new employee is already trained. \n \n9.  A review of the current staffing pattern as practiced by the Monterey County Jail and the best practices \nstaffing plan included in the 2006 Staffing Analysis5 indicates that the critical needs are for the extra \n                                                        \n2   There were twelve vacancies when this assessment was made.  Additionally, the Custody Bureau lost thirty-seven \npositions (sworn and unsworn) between January 2011 and December 2011. \n3   The Custody Bureau โsometimes uses on-duty classification deputies to fill the middle four hours, but most of the time \n[the post is not filled].โ \n4   At the time of this assessment, one sergeant was out on long-term illness and one sergeant was scheduled to retire \nthis month (December 2011).  This will leave two sergeants positions vacant.  Additionally the Custody Bureau lost one \ncaptainสผs position and two commanderสผs positions in the budget cuts earlier this year (2011). \n5  Monterey County Sheriffสผs Office, Staffing Analysis.

These positions will ensure required \nsafety checks are made, there is some level of supervision in the kitchen, laundry and medical areas and \nadequate staffing is available to respond to emergencies and unusual situations.  Recent cuts in staffing \nhave made this situation much worse, thereby exposing the county to additional lawsuits. \n \nRecruitment, Selection and Retention.  The Monterey County Sheriffโs Department experiences difficulty in \nthe recruitment, selection and retention of detention officers for the following reasons. \n \nโข  Monterey County deputiesโ pay and benefits are less than those that are offered by several local, \nstate and federal agencies for similar positions. \nโข  The Custody Bureau estimates that 93% of the applicants for deputy positions in the Sheriffโs \nOffice fail the background investigation for a number of reasons including financial insolvency, \ndrug use and psychological issues. \n \nWhile the above difficulties are common in most county detention systems, the poor working conditions and \nantiquated design of the jail exacerbate Monterey County difficulties.  The feeling of draconian confinement \nand disorientation created by a maze-like layout are more than most potential applicants are willing to bear.  \nThus, the โneedโ for a new adult detention facility goes well beyond a simple โneedโ for additional beds that is, \nin itself, quite critical.  The additional โneedโ is for a facility that protects the safety of deputies and provides \nthem with a professional environment in which to work.  (This is one of the design goals for the new facility \nand is addressed in Section B, Operational and Design Philosophy.) \n \nHistoric Factors.  The issues addressed in the section above historically have been a concern.  As a result, \nthe Sheriffโs command staff has been required to devote a disproportionate amount of time to recruiting, \ntesting, investigating, selecting, mentoring and retaining detention officers.  A new facility will go a long way \ntoward easing the recruiting and retention burden placed on senior officers and will allow them to devote more \nof their energies to law enforcement and inmate rehabilitation issues. \n \nTRGConsulting \n  G.3 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page115 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page85 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \n \nH.  Ability to Provide Visual Supervision \n \nIntroduction.    While  visual  supervision  is \nproblematic in the existing jail, the new Monterey \nCounty housing units will be designed to enhance \nvisual  supervision  as  indicated  in  Section  B \nOperational and Design Philosophy of this needs \nassessment. \n \nExisting Facility Design.  A glaring example of the \nphysical plant limitations in the existing jail is the \ndesign of the control or โguardโ station, and the \nability of staff to directly supervise inmates.  At best \nthere is intermittent observation of the inmates.  In \nthe Rehabilitation Facility, a Deputy Sheriff must \nwalk into the inmate housing area to see the entire \nliving and shower area.  It appears there is an \nattempt to remedy the problem with the use of \ncameras.  Unfortunately, this is not working well.  \nCameras should not be used in place of staff, but \nTransportation van parked in front of the Monterey County \nas a tool for staff in overall security.  Unfortunately, \nRehabilitation Facility.\nstaff is not observing the cameras that are in place, \nbecause they are overtaxed with other obligations. \n \nNew Housing Design.  It is envisioned that the new housing units will offer direct visual supervision from unit \ncontrol into the housing pods and the attached outdoor recreation areas.  Similarly, roving officers will provide \ndirect visual supervision of all areas in all pods including the toilet and shower areas.  Partitions providing \nmodesty to inmates in the toilet area and the showers will be designed so that inmateโs heads and feet always \nare visible.  There will be no blind corners in the housing pods when observed by the roving officers. \n \nVideo, contact and non-contact visiting will be visually observed at all times by officers circulating through the \nspaces.  Again an โopenโ design will be used to ensure ease of observation in contact visiting.  Video and \nnon-contact visiting cubicles will be observed easily by roving officers supplemented by CCTV. \n \nProgram spaces including the medical examination room will be observed by those providing the programs \nand services as well as by roving officers.  Again, spaces will be โopenโ for ease of observation. \n \nFinally, the exterior of the building will be laid out such that visual observation is enhanced.  Adequate night \nlighting and CCTV will aid the direct visual observation of all outside areas including the parking lots. \n \nAdequacy of Staff.  As discussed above the design will permit complete visual observation of all interior and \nexterior spaces in the new Monterey County Adult Detention Facility.  Staffing efficiency will be improved by \nthe improved visibility in the new housing units and support spaces.  Thus, the staffing mandated by Title 15 \nwill be more than adequate to observe all inmates regardless of the activity in which they are involved.  The \nBoard of Supervisors, the County Administrative Officer and the Sheriff and his staff are committed to staffing \nthe new facility as required by Title 15. \n \nTRGConsulting \n  H.1 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page116 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page86 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \n \nI.  Adequacy of Record Keeping \n \nIntroduction.  Record keeping at the Monterey County Jail is quite detailed.  Not only does jail staff maintain \nall records required by Title 15, but they also keep additional records to effectively manage the inmate \npopulation.  Examples include the detailed records relating to overcrowding and early release, inmate \nmanagement records, information on inmates with mental health needs and logs of those on psychotropic \nmedications,  statistics  on  gang  affiliation,  historic  needs  assessments  and  records  relating  to  the \neffectiveness of programs (including records of the effectiveness of alternatives to incarceration). \n \nIn addition to the above, the Custody Bureau maintains a series of notebooks that include a variety of jail \nstatistics and copies of media coverage related to the Monterey County Jail.

Compliance with Standards \n \nIntroduction.  The Monterey County Sheriffโs Office operates a Type II adult detention facility. The facility is \nused for the detention of males and females pending arraignment, during trial, and upon a sentence of \ncommitment. This facility has a unique physical plant design that complies with minimum standards for local \nadult detention facilities.1  The facilityโs four main housing areas and reception area have a Corrections \nStandards Authority (CSA)  rated capacity of 825 inmates.  On any given day,  there can be as many as 1,000 \ninmates in custody.  The existing Monterey County Jail faces three significant issues affecting the success of \nits overall mission and the ability of the Sheriffโs Office to comply with Title 15 and Title 24 standards: \n \n1. poor facility design; \n2. severe overcrowding; and \n3. understaffing. \n \nPoor Facility Design.  The Monterey County Jail is located at 1414 Natividad Road, Salinas, California. The \noriginal rehabilitation facility was built in 1970 with additions to the jail complex occurring in 1977, 1988, 1993,  \nand 1995. Adult male and female inmates are housed in the facility. The Corrections Standards Authority has \ngiven the facility a rated capacity of 825 inmates. This facility has some physical plant limitations that are \ncauses for concern in terms of the safety and security of staff, visitors, volunteers and inmates. \n \nA common thread through all of the four main housing units is the use of the dormitory design. Dormitories \nare much like military barracks, as opposed to single cell or four-man cellblocks. Dormitories are cheaper to \nbuild and theoretically are more cost effective to supervise.  Normally, dormitories are for the lowest level of \nclassification.  In Monterey County, the jail facility has approximately 80% dormitory beds. The conflict occurs \nbecause the Monterey County regularly incarcerates approximately 80% felony sentenced and unsentenced \ninmates.  These are usually the highest level of inmate classification and require single and double cell \nhousing.  Jail staff does not have the ability to classify or segregate problem inmates from other inmates or \nstaff. \n \nThe type of inmate entering local county jails has changed dramatically since the Monterey County Jail \nopened in 1970.  Courts are releasing non-threatening felons prior to trial.  Judges are sentencing more \nmisdemeanants to alternatives to custody.  The jail is left with serious felons awaiting trial and sentenced \nfelons awaiting transportation to the state prison system.  In some ways, the local jail population is no different \nthan those in state prisons.  Local jail populations will become even more similar to state prison populations \nas the full impact of AB 109 is felt.  The design of the housing units at the Monterey County Jail was never \nintended to house the type of felony inmates it now holds or the type of inmates that will be held as mandated \nrecently by AB 109. \n \nNormally in local detention facilities, there is an area designed as a central or main control.  This area does \nnot have the responsibility for inmate supervision.  All staff alarms, fire alarms, and perimeter alarms \nterminate in this area.  This area also controls all external doors and gates into the facility, and accounts for \nall keys.  Depending on the design of the facility, other facility-wide responsibilities could be assigned to this \nposition.  In the case of a major facility emergency or inmate disturbance, this position would function as a \ncommand post.  The Monterey County Jail does not have a central control area designed in this manner.  \n \nOvercrowding.  The Corrections Standards Authority (CSA) inspects and rates the Monterey County Jail.  \nRated capacity means the number of inmate occupants for which a facilityโs single and double occupancy \ncells or dormitories (except those dedicated for health care or disciplinary isolation housing) were planned \nand  designed  in  conformity  to  the  standards  and  requirements  contained  in  the  California  Code  of \nRegulations, Title 15 and Title 24.  The entire Monterey County Jail facility is rated at 825 inmates. As \n                                                        \n1   This detention facility is โgrandfatheredโ and therefore only needs to comply with the standards in place at the time \neach section of the facility was constructed (i.e. the standards in place in 1973 and 1988).  There was one minor issue \nof non-compliance in that the multiple occupancy cells in the female housing unit were rated for four beds but held \neight bunks; however, on the day of the inspection the cells were not overcrowded.  (Corrections Standards Authority \ninspection report of June 8, 2010.)  The facility would not necessarily comply with todayสผs more restrictive standards. \nTRGConsulting \n  J.1 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page119 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page89 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \n \ndiscussed  earlier,  there  can  be  as  many  as  1,000  inmates  in  custody  at  any  given  time.  There  are \napproximately 13,500 inmates booked into the Monterey County Jail a year. \n \nOvercrowding  creates  a  number  of  issues  that  affect  staff  and  inmates,  and  put  the  County  at  risk.  \nOvercrowding causes stress both on inmates and staff. Inmates vs. inmate assaults typically occur more \nfrequently, as do other disciplinary infractions.  Overcrowding affects inmatesโ mental and physical health by \nincreasing the level of uncertainty with which they regularly cope.  There is less space per inmate.  In \nMonterey County there is the possibility of misclassifying inmates based on space rather than security level.  \n(Anecdotal information from staff indicates this occurs occasionally.)  Overcrowding reduces the ability to \nclassify.  This is further compounded by the dormitory design.  Normally, 10% - 15% of the beds should be \nempty and available for classification spikes as well as routine and emergency maintenance.  With the severe \novercrowding in the Monterey County Jail, programming is little, to nonexistent. \n \nA review of the Monterey County Jail admissions and daily housing population indicates that, absent a court \norder, there are few inmates being booked who could be cited and released in lieu of booking.  With 80% of \nthe population having some type of felony charge, there is little that can be done to reduce this group.  It \nappears parole violators are not staying an inordinate amount of time in custody, and sentenced felons are \nmoving on to state prison within an acceptable time frame. \n \nUnderstaffing.  The Monterey County Jail is facing many staff related issues.  These issues affect the overall \nsecurity of the facility and the morale of the staff. \n \nAs discussed in detail in Section G, Adequacy of Staffing Levels, detention facilities must be staffed 24 hours \na day, 7 days a week (24/7) in order to fulfill their mandate to provide safe and secure housing for those \ninmates under their care.  Staff within the Monterey County Jail must be available to receive new bookings in \nthe jail, provide medical care, classify and move inmates within the facility, maintain staff and inmate safety \nand security, provide recreation and exercise, ensure inmates are fed, transport inmates to court or outside \nagencies, and lawfully release inmates.  Due to its nature, a jail cannot simply discontinue operation (e.g. \nrefuse to accept prisoners) if there is not a person available to fill a position.  When detention facilities are not \nstaffed adequately, overtime is necessary to cover an unfilled post. \n \nThe major staffing issues facing the Monterey County Jail are: \n \n1.  It appears that the staffing provided by the County salary ordinance is based on the rated capacity of the \nfacility, not on how many inmates are actually in custody. \n \n2.  It appears there has not been an updated relief factor calculated for some time. \n \n3.  Baseline staffing should be above minimum staffing.  Due to vacancies and other factors, the Monterey \nCounty Jail is constantly using overtime to staff up to their self-imposed minimum staffing.  This level is \nnot adequate to provide basic safety and security for staff and inmates.  \n  \n4.  Vacancies, extended periods of leave, and normal staff attrition have resulted in a significant amount of \nvacant POST positions.  The jail has an increased reliance on overtime to meet minimum staffing. \n \n5.  The extensive use of overtime can be dangerous since staff may have recently completed a shift, when \nthey are required to work additional overtime.  Efforts should be made to reduce the number of overtime \nhours.  \n \n6.  Supervision is a critical task in any detention facility.  Supervisors ensure that policy is followed, tasks are \ncompleted, critical decisions are made and exposure to liability from โfailure to superviseโ claims are \nlimited.  In Monterey County, sergeants fill in for line positions when relief is unavailable.  This leaves a \ngap in first line supervision.  Even at full authorized staffing, it appears the span of control for sergeants is \nweak and additional positions for minimum supervision are necessary. \n \nTRGConsulting \n  J.2 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page120 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page90 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \n \n7.  Chronic understaffing lowers morale, employees are unable to take breaks (in violation of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act), employees get โburned outโ with mandatory overtime, employees must take โshortcutsโ to \nget the job done and employees are forced to assume collateral duties to allow the facility to function. \n \n8.  The current authorized staffing for the Monterey Jail is woefully inadequate.  Even if every vacancy were \nfilled with a fully trained staff member, the facility would not have enough staff to meet the minimum \nstaffing, let alone adequate staffing.   \n9.  A review of the current staffing pattern as practiced by the Monterey County Jail and the best practices \nstaffing plan included in the recent Staffing Analysis2 indicates that the critical needs are for the extra \nstaffing in the housing units and for facility-wide escort deputies.  These positions will ensure required \nsafety checks are made, there is some level of supervision in the kitchen, laundry and medical areas and \nadequate staffing is available to respond to emergencies and unusual situations.  Additionally there \nshould be two additional positions assigned to classification that are not included in the Staffing Analysis. \n                                                        \n2   Monterey County Sheriffสผs Office, Staffing Analysis.

Unresolved Issues \n \nUnresolved Issues.  Six issues remain unresolved, mostly due to the uncertainty surrounding the final impact \nof AB 109 (Criminal Justice Alignment) as modified by AB 117 (Criminal Justice Realignment) on the \nMonterey County criminal justice system.  Unresolved issues include: \n \n1.  The impact of Phase II of the Public Safety and Offender Rehabilitation Services Act of 2007 on Monterey \nCounty. \n2.  The final impact of AB 109 (as modified by AB 117) on the Monterey County criminal justice system. \n3.  Sources of funding for the construction, project and operational costs that are associated with meeting the \nprojected bed need for 2020 and 2030; \n4.  The construction phasing of the 2030 need; \n5.  The ultimate disposition of the three components1 of the existing Monterey County Jail (e.g. continued \nuse of one or more components for detention, demolition of one or more components, etc.); and \n6.  The specific location of the new construction on the Natividad site. \n \n \n \n1.  The Public Safety and Offender Rehabilitation Services Act of 2007.2  This act includes provisions for \nCDCR and county detention facilities.  The provisions in the act that relate to local detention facilities include: \n \n$1.2 billion will be provided for local jail bed construction in two phases: \nโ  Phase I will provide $750,000,000 (plus an additional local match of 25%) for 8,000 beds. \nโ  Phase II will provide $602,881,0003 (plus an additional local match of 10%)4 for 5,000 beds. \n(cid:1)  Compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act is the responsibility of the county. \n(cid:1)  The Corrections Standards Authority (CSA) will consider โcost effectivenessโ in evaluating projects. \n(cid:1)  Funding will be provided for โthe cost of the local jail facility project and ongoing maintenance and \nstaffing responsibilities for the term of the financing.โ \n(cid:1)  CSA requirements will include, but are not limited to: \nโ  Control of the project site; \nโ  Documentation of need; \nโ  Written project proposal; \nโ  Submittal of a staffing plan (the new construction must be staffed and operating within ninety \ndays of the completion of construction); \nโ  Submittal of approved architectural drawings; \nโ  Final determination of economic impact; and \nโ  Provisions intended to maintain tax-exempt status. \n(cid:1)  Matching funds will be a minimum of 10% of total project costs; and \n \n \n                                                        \n1   The jail consists of three components (i.e. the Rehabilitation Facility, the Main Jail and the Womanโs Jail). \n2   The Public Safety and Offender Rehabilitation Services Act of 2007 also is referred to as Assembly Bill 900 (AB 900). \n3   The Phase II funding was increased from the original $470,000,000 to $602,881,000 of which $200,000,000 is \navailable as medium-sized county set-asides.  Monterey County is classified as a medium-sized county. \n4   The local match requirement for Phase II was reduced from 25% to 10% by AB 94 and AB 111 amendments.  Any \ncombination of cash and in-kind contributions are allowed, subject to certain limitations. \nTRGConsulting \n  K.1 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page122 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page92 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \n \nThe Corrections Standards Authority has issued grant application instructions for Phase II funding associated \nwith the Public Safety and Offender Rehabilitation Services Act of 2007.  Monterey County and the Sheriffโs \nOffice have elected to pursue the maximum state funding available for medium-sized counties of $80,000,000 \nto begin to address the shortage of adult detention beds in the county. \n \n2.  AB 109, Criminal Justice Alignment as modified by AB 117 (Criminal Justice Realignment).

\n(cid:1)\nOngoing state parole:  \n(cid:1)  CDCR continues to have jurisdiction over all offenders on state parole prior to October 1, 2011 \nimplementation  \n(cid:1)  State parole will continue for the following:  \nโ  The offenderโs committing offense is a serious or violent felony as described in PC ยงยง1192.7(c) or \n667.5(c);  \nโ  The offender has been convicted of a third strike;  \nโ  The person is classified as a high risk sex offender; or  \nโ  The person is classified as a Mentally Disordered Offender (MDO).  \n \nParole revocations:  \n(cid:1)  Prospectively, the parole revocation process continues under Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) until \nJuly 1, 2013.  \n(cid:1)  Parole revocations will be served in county jail and not to exceed 180 days.  \n(cid:1)  Contracting back to the state for revocations is not an option.  \n(cid:1)  Only persons previously sentenced to a term of life can be revoked to prison.  \n(cid:1)  For the remaining low-level offenders on parole after implementation of realignment, parole has the \nauthority to discharge after six months if no violations have occurred.  \n(cid:1)\nJuvenile Justice  \n(cid:1)  AB 109 limited the future juvenile court commitments to state juvenile detention (Division of Juvenile \nJustice or DJJ); this provision was removed in AB 117. Consequently, there are no changes to the \nstate juvenile justice system in realignment.  \n \nThe Monterey County criminal justice system is just beginning to feel the impact of AB 109 and AB 117.  It will \ntake at least a year to understand and adjust to these pieces of legislation.  Even if the county is successful in \nobtaining grant funding to construct additional beds, these beds will not come on line for several years.  In the \nmeantime the Custody Bureau of the Sheriffโs Office must accommodate the new influx of inmates brought \nabout by this legislation and accommodate these inmates in the existing detention facilities.  This is difficult \nbecause the Custody Bureau only has 825 Corrections Standards Authority rated detention beds5 and \nregularly incarcerates over 1,000 inmates.  The Monterey County Jail obviously already is overcrowded.  The \nSheriff will be faced with difficult decisions regarding which inmates will be housed and which inmates will be \nplaced in alternative programs or released. \n \n \n3.  Funding.  Potential funding sources include federal, state, county and/or private funds.  The preference is \nto pursue grant funding that will require minimal matching dollars from Monterey County because of the \ncountyโs limited resources.  Grant funding will augment local resources that will be needed to construct beds \nto meet the projected need for 2020 and 2030. \n \nThe county will consider potential funding sources after the estimates of probable construction, project and \noperational costs have been developed and refined in the process described later in this section. \n \n \n                                                        \n5   Only 153 of these beds are located in single cells (there are no CSA rated double cells), which would be the most \nappropriate type of housing for most AB 109 inmates. \nTRGConsulting \n  K.4 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page125 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page95 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \n \n4.  Construction Phasing for 2030 Bed Need.  Recommended construction phasing cannot be determined \nuntil the 2030 bed need is finalized.  This will occur once the Sheriffโs Office and/or the Board of Supervisors: \n \nโข  understand the impact of Phase II of the Public Safety and Offender Rehabilitation Services Act \nof 2007; \nโข  fully understand the impact of AB 109 as modified by AB 117 on the Monterey County criminal \njustice system; and \nโข  the funding sources for construction, operations and staffing are determined. \n \n \n5.  Disposition of the Components of the Existing Monterey County Jail.  The Monterey County Jail consists of \nthree components: \n \n1.  The Rehabilitation Facility. \n2.  The Main Jail. \n3.  The Womanโs Jail. \n \nThe near term and ultimate disposition of these three components will depend upon: \n \nโข  how rapidly the county can โcatch upโ with the needed number of beds so that consideration can be \ngiven to replacing any or all of the three components (particularly the Rehabilitation Facility, which \nhas outlived itโs useful life); \nโข  the useful life of all three components when considering the cost of replacing antiquated and worn out \nbuilding systems and components; \nโข  the adequacy of the housing and support spaces in terms of the type of inmates held; \nโข  the need for the site on which any of the three components is located for a higher and better purpose \n(e.g. replacing the Rehabilitation Facility with housing that is more appropriate for the inmates being \nheld, etc.). \n \n \n6.  Location.  At this stage of the planning process it appears as though any new construction will occur in the \nparking area northwest of the existing jail between the jail and the juvenile hall; this area is bordered on the \nnortheast by the Sheriffโs Public Safety Building and on the southwest by county property (including the \nCounty Hospital); \n \nThe total number of beds and the associated support space requirements may need to be increased because \nof the remaining uncertainty associated with the Public Safety and Offender Rehabilitation Services Act of \n2007 and the impact of AB 109 as modified by AB 117.  If a large number of additional beds are added to the \ncounty needs already identified, then it may be necessary to expand into the area occupied by county \nstructures associated with the old hospital (to the southwest of the existing jail).  An alternative would be to \nconstruct a new juvenile hall and Probation Department offices on another site and take over the area \ncurrently occupied by the Probation Department between Natividad Road and the existing jail parking lot. \n \nThe actual construction site(s) for the new adult detention facility will be chosen after the total bed need is \ndetermined for each new construction project.  At that point a detailed architectural program will be written to \nfurther define the project.  The architectural program will identify the building gross square footages of the \nnew housing pods and any associated program and support buildings.  The required site amenities including \nmandated recreation space, parking, etc. also will be identified.  Future long-term expansion of the new adult \ndetention facility will be addressed as well. \n \n \nImplementation Strategy to Resolve Issues.  The remaining activities required to resolve these issues are \ndiscussed below.  Monterey County is committed to continuing this implementation strategy until all issues are \nTRGConsulting \n  K.5 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page126 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page96 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \n \nresolved  and  new  adult  detention  beds  and  support  spaces  are  constructed  and  occupied.6    The \nimplementation schedule will be reviewed periodically and accelerated as appropriate.  The six unresolved \nissues identified above will be resolved as part of this strategy. \n \nConceptual Schedule and Budget.  A conceptual schedule and budget will be developed based on this needs \nassessment in order to determine the feasibility of the next project. \n \nThe conceptual schedule will contain all major milestones from the refinement of the needs assessment as \nmore is learned about the impact of AB 109 and AB 117 to the occupancy of the new adult detention beds \nand support spaces.  Included will be the milestone dates on which decisions to continue the project must be \nmade if the projected occupancy date is to be met. \n \nThree conceptual budgets will be developed.  The first will present the estimate of probable construction costs \nfor the new adult detention construction.7  Secondly the estimate of probable project costs will be developed \nbased on the estimate of construction costs.8  Finally, the estimate of probable operational costs will be \nprepared.9  The combination of the three estimates will provide the leadership of Monterey County with the \nanticipated costs to design, bid and construct the new adult detention beds and support spaces as well as the \ncosts to operate the facility once it is occupied.  All three estimates will be refined as more information \nbecomes available during each step of the process. \n \nThe conceptual schedule and budget will establish baselines that will be adjusted appropriately throughout \nthe process leading to new detention beds and support spaces.  Project participants and county leadership \ncontinuously will be updated with information concerning the timeline and projected costs for the new \nconstruction.  The feasibility of the project will be assessed at each stage of the implementation strategy. \n \nOperational Program Statement.  Section 13-102(c) 3 of Title 24, Part 1 requires the operational program \nstatement  to  be  submitted  to  the  Corrections  Standards  Authority  (CSA)  with  the  schematic  design \narchitectural documents.10  Monterey County has elected to prepare the program statement early in the \nconceptual process to be certain that the architectural program and any design work are driven by program \nrequirements. \n \nThe operational program statement will include a description of the following: \n \nA.  Intended capacity of facility. \nB.  Security and classification of inmates to be housed. \nC.  Inmate movement within the facility and entry and exit from security areas. \nD.

Similarly Monterey County has elected to prepare the staffing plan early in the conceptual \nprocess to be certain that staffing requirements โdriveโ the architectural program and any design work.  This \nwill ensure a staff efficient design and reduce operating expenses.11 \n \nThe staffing plan will include: \n \nโข  the number of FTE staff required to fill post positions; \nโข  staff requirements during construction; \nโข  relief factors for each post position; \nโข  selection of new staff (by post position); \nโข  new staff hiring and training schedules; and \nโข  program/operational requirements. \n \nThe operational estimate of probable costs and the project schedule will be adjusted as necessary based on \nthe staffing plan. \n \nArchitectural Program.  An architectural program will be developed to determine the detailed requirements for \neach space, area and component of the new detention beds and support spaces.  Activities and operations \nfor each component will be described so that the architectural design will reflect the requirements of Titles 15 \nand 24 as well as the programs and staffing desired by Monterey County.  Building gross square footages of \nall housing, program and support spaces will be determined.  The architectural program will identify the \nbuilding systems to be used and the site area required along with all site amenities (e.g. outdoor recreation \nareas, security perimeters, vehicular and pedestrian sally ports, secure and non-secure parking, security and \nsite lighting, loading docks/delivery areas, etc.). \n \nThe project schedule and the construction and project estimates of probable costs will be adjusted as \nnecessary based on the architectural program. \nThe specific location of the components of the new adult detention facilities on the Natividad site will be \nconfirmed based on the site requirements developed in the architectural program. \n \n                                                        \n11  Previous grants administered by CSA included a requirement that a detailed staffing plan be submitted with the \narchitectural design development documents.  The Public Safety and Offender Rehabilitation Services Act of 2007 \nrequires that all funded detention facilities be staffed and operational within ninety days of the completion of \nconstruction. \nTRGConsulting \n  K.7 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page128 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page98 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \n \nConceptual Design.  At this point a conceptual design consisting of a site plan, floor plans, elevations and an \narchitectural rendering will be developed to further refine the construction and project estimates and to \nprovide the architectural design concepts necessary for most grant applications and other funding initiatives. \n \nIdentification of Funding Sources.  The county will research traditional and non-traditional potential funding \nsources such as:  \n \nโ  Federal, state and private grants \nโ  Impact fees \nโ  Lease/purchase financing (lease payments with purchase option) \nโ  California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank Loans \nโ  Industrial Revenue Bonds \nโ  Local option sales tax \nโ  General obligation bonds \nโ  Certificates of Participation (COPs) \n \nMore creative funding sources such as the following also may be considered:  \n \nโ  Agreements with other counties to participate in a regional detention facility \nโ  Homeland Security funds \nโ  United States Department of Agriculture Rural Development ($100,000 to $2,000,000 to finance \nessential community facilities) \nโ  California Energy Commission loans (loans up to $2,500,000 for financing energy conservation \nmeasures as part of new detention facilities) \nโ  Environmental Protection Agency grants (e.g. by proving a new facility will reduce transportation \nemissions  through  such  initiatives  as  providing  on-site  court  facilities  to  eliminate  the  need  to \ntransport inmates to distant court facilities). \n \nThe project budget will be adjusted based on funding sources available and the timeline in which those funds \nwill become available.  The milestone schedule will be modified as necessary based on the funding timeline. \n \nResolution.  Once the funding sources are identified all unresolved items will be satisfied since, by this time, \nthe impact of the Public Safety and Offender Rehabilitation Services Act of 2007 and the final impact of AB \n109 as modified by AB 117 will be known. The architectural program and master plan will identify the parts of \nthe existing jail that are to be retained or demolished for new construction.  The specific location of the new \ndetention beds and support spaces on the jail site will have been determined. \n \nWhen these issues are resolved Monterey County will be in a position to obtain the necessary funding, move \nforward with the architectural design and construction documents and advertise the project for competitive \nbid.12  Selection of the contractor, construction, transition and phased occupancy then will follow in the normal \ncourse of events. \n                                                        \n12  Monterey County staff also may consider using the design build project delivery methodology. \nTRGConsulting \n  K.8 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page129 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-1   Filed06/12/14   Page99 of 100\nMONTEREY COUNTY ADULT DETENTION NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \n \nAppendix \n \nThe Appendix includes a list of stakeholders for the project. \n \n \nStakeholders \nRevision 03; December 12, 2011 \n \n \nIntroduction.

I would \nlike to thank everyone that assisted by providing access to the documents needed for the \nreview in addition to access to the jails. I also would like to thank Monterey County \nSheriff Scott Miller and all of his staff for being exceptionally accommodating during my \nthree days of visiting the jails. Additionally, Dr. Taylor Fithian, Correctional Health \nServices  (CHS)  Manager  Dave  Harness  and  the  mental  health  clinicians  provided \nextensive information regarding the mental health services. \n \n \nCollection of data for the report: \n \nI reviewed the Monterey County Correctional Facilities including the Main Jail and the \nRehabilitation Center located on the campus in Salinas, California. My site visits were \ncompleted on September 25, October 4 and October 25, 2013. I interviewed Commander \nJim Bass and Classification Sgt. Durham who work collaboratively with mental health \nstaff at the jail. I additionally interviewed Deputies Pritchett and DiMaggio who routinely \nsupervise  inmates  in  the  jail.  I  also  interviewed  Taylor  Fithian,  M.D.,  the  primary \npsychiatrist; Elaine Finnberg, the primary psychologist; Kim Spano, Licensed Marriage \nand Family Therapist (L.M.F.T.) and Charlotte Gage, Licensed Psychiatric Nurse. I \nreviewed 23 mental health records including records of inmate-patients that were treated \nwith  antipsychotic  medication,  inmate-patients  that  refused  mental  health  treatment, \ninmates evaluated for competency to stand trial, inmates that attempted or completed \nsuicide, inmates that were placed in a Safety Cell or in the restraint chair, and inmate-\npatients  that  required  housing  in  administrative  segregation  areas.  I  conducted  six \ninterviews  with  inmate-patients  including  four  that  were  accepting  mental  health \ntreatment and two that were refusing treatment. I additionally reviewed incident reports \non suicides, suicide attempts, placement in the Safety Cells and the use of the restraint \nchair. I also reviewed the policies and procedures regarding Mental Health Services, \nDevelopmental Disabilities, and the use Safety Cells and the Restraint chair. I reviewed \nthe Complaint, records of community treatment of mentally ill inmates, and deputy \ntraining programs for suicide prevention and management of inmates having problems \nwith serious mental illness, developmental disabilities and substance use disorders. \n \n \n1.  Review of Intake and Receiving Screening: \n \n๏ท  All arrestees that are accepted into the custody of the Sheriff complete an intake \nscreening provided by Sheriff's deputies at the Main Jail. The screening officers \nreceive specific training regarding the identification of arrestees that may present \n \n[1035449-\n1] \n\nCasCe5a:s1e47-c:1v4-0-c2v7-3002-7B3L0F     D Dooccuummeennt1t5-25      FFiilleedd0160//1228//1144      PPaaggee41 3o4f  1o9f 227\n \nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document49-7   Filed04/29/14   Page6 of 79\na risk of self-harm or may require mental health evaluation or treatment. Arrestees \nthat are determined to have a possible risk of self-harm or to require additional \nmental health evaluation are referred to medical staff. A registered nurse (R.N.) \nthen  evaluates  the  inmate  and  completes  a  form  requesting  mental  health \nevaluation.  \n \n๏ท  All inmates identified as requiring a mental health evaluation are seen by a mental \nhealth  clinician,  usually  within  24  hours  on  Monday  through  Fridays.  The \nclinicians include Taylor Fithian, M.D., Elaine Finnberg, Ph.D., Kim Spano, \nL.M.F.T. and Charlotte Gage, R.N. Dr. Fithian typically sees only the inmates that \nare referred for additional psychiatric evaluation following an intake assessment \nby Charlotte Gage, R.N. However, all of the clinicians respond to urgent requests \nfor mental health assessments of inmates.  \n \n๏ท  The mental health clinicians at the jail are available to provide urgent mental \nhealth evaluations within a brief period of time on Monday through Fridays. \nThere are no mental health clinicians assigned to the jail on weekends although \nDr. Fithian or Dr. Finnberg always would be available on call. The medical nurses \nrespond to inmates that need mental health services on the weekend and telephone \nthe on-call doctor for consultation. Any inmate that requires urgent services may \nbe placed on a W&I 5150 hold and transported by deputies to Natividad Medical \nCenter which is a short distance from the jail campus. The lack of mental health \nstaff in the facility on weekends results in insufficient services to mentally ill \ninmates and is further discussed below. \n \n๏ท  The intake screening process would be improved by several additional questions \ndesigned to increase the identification of arrestees with a potential for self-harm \nor a history of mental disorder.  \n \nRecommendation: add the following (or similar) questions to the Intake Health Screening form: \na.  Have you been admitted to a hospital during the past five years? Were you ever admitted \non a (W&I) 5150? \nb.  Have you ever had problems with depression? Are you feeling depressed now? \nc.  Have you ever had mental health counseling or treatment? \n \n \n๏ท  Inmates are able to access mental health services through multiple routes. As \nnoted above, many inmates are identified as possible mental health clients based \non positive responses to the initial health screening questions. Healthcare staff and \ndeputies also refer inmates based on their observations of emotions or behaviors \nthat suggest the inmate may be able to benefit from a mental health evaluation or \nthat suggest a risk of self-harm. \t\n \n๏ท  Inmates request mental health services by completing a Health Request form or \nby verbally making a request to any deputy or healthcare staff. Inmates are \nadvised how to complete a Health Request form during the booking process and \n  2\n[1035449-1] \n\nCasCe5a:s1e47-c:1v4-0-c2v7-3002-7B3L0F     D Dooccuummeennt1t5-25      FFiilleedd0160//1228//1144      PPaaggee51 3o5f  1o9f 227\n \nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document49-7   Filed04/29/14   Page7 of 79\nbilingual staff provide intake screening in Spanish or other languages as needed. \nTranslation services for all languages are available from facility staff and through \na telephone service. \t\n \n๏ท  Health Request forms are available from nursing staff and once completed the \nforms are handed to any medical staff or deposited in locked boxes. These boxes \nalso are used for grievance forms and only selected Sheriff's officers have keys to \nopen the boxes and collect the grievances and Health Request forms. This practice \nrequires modification since current correctional healthcare standards require that \ninmates have privacy of their healthcare requests. The simple solution would be to \nprovide keys to the locked boxes to healthcare staff who would collect the Health \nRequest forms and the grievances daily. This may require some additional time of \nthe health care staff to separate the grievances and give them to the deputies. An \nalternate solution would be to add an additional locked box for Health Request \nforms in each pod, which also would be collected by healthcare staff. The Health \nRequest forms are triaged daily by a registered nurse and requests for mental \nhealth services are provided to the mental health clinicians. \t\n \nRecommendation: modify the current practice of retrieving Health Request forms from inmates \nto ensure that they are collected and reviewed only by healthcare staff. \n \n\t\n๏ท  The medical nurses accept health requests that are written on anything including \nblank paper or scrap paper. This is a commendable practice since it facilitates the \ninmatesโ access to health services. Review of the charts indicated that written \nresponses usually are provided to inmates within an appropriate period of time. \nHowever, several inmates complained during interviews that they did not receive \nresponses to some of their written health requests. The current procedures lack a \nsystematic method of auditing receipt of and responses to all inmate requests for \nhealth services. It is recommended that Correctional Health Services modify the \nHealth Request form as follows:  \t\n \nRecommendation: It is recommended that Correctional Health Services develop a triplicate \nNCR form for health requests. The inmate completes the triplicate form and retains one copy \nbefore forwarding the form to nursing staff. The nurse provides a written response on the form \nand returns it to the inmate while retaining a copy for the health record. This system would \nenable the Quality Management program to audit the processing of inmate health requests and \nensure timely responses to all requests.  \n\t\n \n๏ท  Mental health referrals and inmate requests for mental health services frequently \nare forwarded to the psychiatric nurse for a mental health intake evaluation. The \npsychiatric nurse dictates a note briefly summarizing the inmate's symptoms and \nhistory and formulating an initial treatment plan that may include referral to the \npsychiatrist or the LMFT. Review of the records confirms that the psychiatric \n  3\n[1035449-1] \n\nCasCe5a:s1e47-c:1v4-0-c2v7-3002-7B3L0F     D Dooccuummeennt1t5-25      FFiilleedd0160//1228//1144      PPaaggee61 3o6f  1o9f 227\n \nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document49-7   Filed04/29/14   Page8 of 79\nnurse has access to the Monterey County Behavioral Health Services system and \nroutinely obtains relevant information by telephone and fax. \t\n\t\nRecommendation:  It  is  recommended  that  Correctional  Mental  Health  Services  develop  a \nmental health intake form with a checklist to summarize the inmate-patient's symptom and \ntreatment  history,  community  provider(s),  prior  diagnoses  and  medications,  co-occurring \ndisorders, substance use, and history of self-harm or suicidal ideation and attempts. The intake \nform would ensure that all relevant information is obtained at the time of the initial contact.\t\n \n \n๏ท  The psychiatric nurse inquires of each new inmate-patient if he or she has any \nrecent history of taking psychiatric medications and also asks where the inmate-\npatient obtained the medications. The nurse then contacts the pharmacy to verify \nthe prescription and telephones Dr. Fithian to obtain a voice order to start the \nmedications. Review of the records indicates that this procedure is effective and \ninmate-patients often are started on psychiatric medications within 72 hours and \nsometimes within 24 hours during the week. Continuity of mental health care \nwould be improved by modifying the current system to have nursing staff initiate \npsychiatric  medication  verification  when  the  nurse  completes  the  first  health \nevaluation. Once the medications are verified the psychiatric nurse can obtain a \ntelephone order from Dr. Fithian during the week and the medical nurse would \nobtain the order on weekends.  \n \nRecommendation:  modify  the  current  practice  to  have  nursing  staff  initiate  psychiatric \nmedication verification at the time that the nurse completes the first health evaluation. This \nwould apply to any inmate-patient that offers information regarding the pharmacy that supplies \nthe psychiatric medication. Once a current or recent prescription is verified the psychiatric nurse \ncan obtain a telephone order from Dr. Fithian during the week and the medical nurse would \nobtain the order on weekends. \n \n \n๏ท  Once the psychiatric medications are ordered by Dr. Fithian the inmate-patient \ncan  begin  receiving  the  medication.  There  is  an  onsite  stock  supply  of  the \nfrequently used psychiatric medications and most of them are on the formulary for \nthe facility. Non-formulary medications also can be requested by Dr. Fithian. \nReview of the health records indicate that inmate-patients usually begin receiving \nthe medication on the same day it is ordered or by the following day. \t\n \n๏ท  Timeliness of continuing psychiatric medications should be routinely reviewed by \nthe  Quality  Management  program.  Overall,  the  current  system  of  screening \narrestees for possible mental disorders and risk of self-harm is effective and meets \nminimal  standards  for  the  identification  of  arrestees  with  mental  disorders. \nHowever, the above recommendations are needed to ensure that mental health \nevaluation and treatment begins within a short period following acceptance to the \njail and that psychiatric medications are verified and initiated on weekends as \nquickly as during the week whenever possible.\t\n  4\n[1035449-1] \n\nCasCe5a:s1e47-c:1v4-0-c2v7-3002-7B3L0F     D Dooccuummeennt1t5-25      FFiilleedd0160//1228//1144      PPaaggee71 3o7f  1o9f 227\n \nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document49-7   Filed04/29/14   Page9 of 79\n2.  Review of mental health treatment services:\t\n\t\n๏ท  Mental health evaluation and treatment services are provided by a total of four \nmental  health  professionals  including  Taylor  Fithian,  M.D.,  Elaine  Finnberg, \nPh.D., Kim Spano, L.M.F.T. and Charlotte Gage, R.N. The number of mental \nhealth professionals is insufficient to meet the mental health needs of the inmates \nin the Monterey County Jails.  \n \n๏ท  Once an inmate has demonstrated a stable clinical status, he or she is eligible for \nhousing in almost any of the various correctional pods or at the Rehabilitation \nCenter. The LMFT and psychiatric nurse provide on-site outpatient therapeutic \nand supportive services. Dr. Fithian primarily provides psychiatric evaluation and \nmedications and Dr. Finberg primarily provides psychological evaluations and \ncrisis intervention.  \n \n๏ท  Inmates that display signs of an acute mental illness may be maintained in Intake \nuntil evaluated by a mental health clinician. As noted above, the mental health \nclinicians are not in the facility on weekends although either the psychiatrist or a \npsychologist is always on call. Inmates that require mental health services on \nweekends are evaluated by a medical nurse who then consults with the on-call \npsychiatrist or psychologist. The facility has the capability of transporting an \ninmate to Natividad Medical Center for acute psychiatric services on weekends. \nHowever, review of the records indicates that this rarely occurs and most inmate-\npatients remain in the jail until the mental health clinicians arrive on Monday. \nThey may be placed in a safety cell on suicide precautions for observation until \nthey can be evaluated by a mental health clinician. The safety cells are used \nexcessively for this purpose and inmates may remain in the safety cell over the \nweekend until a clinician provides evaluation and release on Mondays. Weekend \nmental health coverage is insufficient to meet the multiple needs of mentally ill \ninmate-patients, which include timely assessments, continuation of psychiatric \nmedications  and  early  release  from  the  safety  cells.  It  is  recommended  that \nCorrectional Health Services hire part-time licensed mental health clinicians to \nprovide weekend services. \n \nRecommendation: hire part-time licensed mental health clinicians to provide six to eight hours \nof mental health services on each Saturday, Sunday and holiday. These clinicians would provide \nmental health intake assessments, crisis intervention services, evaluations of inmates in the safety \ncells or the restraint chair and supportive counseling to seriously mentally ill inmate-patients \nhoused in the administrative segregation pods. A total of 20 hours of additional clinician services \nwould be sufficient to meet minimal standards for correctional mental health care. This would \ninclude 12 to 16 hours of weekend services and four to eight additional hours during the week as \ndescribed below. \n \n \n๏ท   Inmates identified as having impaired intellectual functioning (a developmental \ndisability) also are screened initially by a nurse and then by a mental health \n  5\n[1035449-1] \n\nCasCe5a:s1e47-c:1v4-0-c2v7-3002-7B3L0F     D Dooccuummeennt1t5-25      FFiilleedd0160//1228//1144      PPaaggee81 3o8f  1o9f 227\n \nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document49-7   Filed04/29/14   Page10 of 79\nclinician. The classification deputy is notified of the inmate-patient's disability \nand provides appropriate housing to ensure safety. The regional developmental \ndisability center is notified so that a case manager can plan to assist the inmate-\npatient upon return to the community. \n \n๏ท  Inmates  with  psychotic  symptoms  that  are  secondary  to  the  ingestion  of  a \nsubstance may be housed in a safety cell for observation and stabilization because \nthey present an increased risk of self-harm or assault. Dr. Fithian evaluates these \ninmates  and  provides  treatment  with  psychiatric  medications  as  needed  to \nstabilize  their  symptoms.  Inmate-patients  with  substance-induced  psychotic \nsymptoms frequently stabilize within several days and then are housed by the \nclassification deputy. Correctional Health Services also provides a withdrawal \nprotocol for inmate-patients with acute alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal. \n \n๏ท  The mental health clinicians collaborate with community providers of alcohol and \nother  drug  (AOD)  services  to  ensure  that  inmate-patients  are  able  to  access \nchemical  dependency  treatment.  Two  of  the  AOD  providers  with  Monterey \nCounty Behavioral Health Services are available for referrals of inmates including \nthose with co-occurring disorders of mental illness and substance abuse. The jail \nalso provides group AOD counseling services at the Rehabilitation Center. These \nservices exemplify the commitment of Monterey County to provide integrated \ntreatment for co-occurring disorders that include substance abuse and mental \nillness.  \n \n๏ท  Acutely mentally ill inmates are evaluated by Dr. Fithian and offered medication \nto stabilize their symptoms. The most commonly used psychiatric medications are \navailable on the formulary and non-formulary medications can be ordered. Acute \ninmate-patients are evaluated frequently by the mental health clinicians.  \n \n๏ท  Mental health treatment is voluntary in the absence of a court order and inmate-\npatients that accept treatment frequently stabilize and may be housed in a general \nhousing  pod  as  determined  by  Classification.  Inmate-patients  that  have  not \nstabilized are usually housed in administrative segregation pods including the A \nand B pods for males and the R and S units for females. The psychiatric nurse \nprovides socialization/support groups to the inmate-patients on these units when \nthey are sufficiently stable to safely participate in a group. She provides groups in \nthe A and B male pods during one week and to the women in the R and S units \nduring the following week. Deputies that are familiar with the pods determine \nwhich inmate-patients are able to safely participate in the socialization groups. \nThese  groups  are  important  to  support  and  maintain  stabilization  of  inmate-\npatients with serious mental illnesses and additional opportunities to participate \nwould  be  beneficial.  The  Sheriff  could  facilitate  participation  by  enhancing \nsecurity procedures on the units. Other correctional facilities have accomplished \nthis by welding links to the tables on the unit so that inmate-patients can be safely \nsecured to the table with belly chains while they participate in the group. These \n  6\n[1035449-1] \n\nCasCe5a:s1e47-c:1v4-0-c2v7-3002-7B3L0F     D Dooccuummeennt1t5-25      FFiilleedd0160//1228//1144      PPaaggee91 3o9f  1o9f 227\n \nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document49-7   Filed04/29/14   Page11 of 79\ngroups are voluntary and inmate-patients must be educated regarding the safety \nprocedures before they begin participating in the groups.  \n \nRecommendation: it is recommended that the Sheriff collaborate with Dr. Fithian and the \nCorrectional Health Services Manager to facilitate additional participation of inmate-patients in \nthe socialization groups provided by the psychiatric nurse. Sheriffโs administration can explore \nchaining the inmate-patients to a table on the unit and other methods of increasing security to \nfacilitate additional participation. Any new construction at the jail may provide an opportunity to \ndesign a secure room for socialization groups. Some facilities have built group rooms with six \nindividual locked cages that allow inmate-patients to safely participate in socialization groups.  \n \n \n๏ท  The socialization groups provide valuable opportunities for inmate-patients to \nreceive  support  in  addition  to  education  about  mental  health  treatment.  The \npsychiatric nurse does not have sufficient time to provide weekly groups to both \nmale and female inmate-patients in the facility. An additional total of 20 hours of \nlicensed mental health clinician time is needed to provide sufficient services to \nseriously mentally ill inmate-patients as noted above. Most of these clinical hours \nare  needed  on  Saturdays  and  Sundays  when  no  mental  health  clinicians  are \navailable in the facility.  \n \nRecommendation:  as  described  above,  add  part-time  licensed  mental  health  clinicians  to \nprovide a total of 20 additional hours of mental health services weekly, primarily on weekends. \nThis would include six to eight hours of clinical services on each Saturday, Sunday and holiday. \nThe additional staff would assume some of the current duties of the psychiatric nurse and allow \nher to provide weekly socialization/support groups for both male and female inmate-patients. \n \n \n๏ท  Review of the records indicates that Dr. Fithian consistently sees inmate-patients \nwithin seven days of starting them on a psychiatric medication. The second face-\nto-face visit occurs within 30 days for stable inmate-patients and more frequently \nfor those that have not stabilized. Subsequent face-to-face psychiatric evaluations \noccur at a minimum of every 90 days for stable inmate-patients and those who are \nnot stable are seen more frequently. All inmate-patients are seen by a mental \nhealth clinician at least once every 30 days even if they refuse mental health \ntreatment. Dr. Fithian's scheduling of face-to-face psychiatric evaluations meets \nnationally accepted minimal standards for the provision of psychiatric services to \ncorrectional inmate-patients. \n \n๏ท  Inmates  with  acute  mental  illness  may  have  difficulties  as  they  attempt  to \ncommunicate with an attorney during the process of developing a defense and \nthey may be referred for evaluation of their competency to continue with legal \nprocedures. Competency evaluations are requested by the Court and the Court \noften appoints Dr. Fithian and Dr. Finnberg to complete evaluations. There is a \npanel  of  psychiatrists  and  psychologists  qualified  to  provide  competency \nevaluations and the court has the option to select other examiners from the panel. \n  7\n[1035449-1] \n\nCasCea5s:1e47-:c1v4--0c2v7-03207-B30L F   D  Docoucmumenetn1t-525     F Filieledd0160/1/228/1/144     P Paaggee1104 o0f  o1f9 227\n \nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document49-7   Filed04/29/14   Page12 of 79\nThe Court frequently prefers the services of Dr. Fithian and Dr. Finnberg for these \nevaluations because they often are familiar with the defendants after providing \nthem with mental health services in the jail. However, this practice fails to meet \ncommunity standards for independent evaluations that avoid compromising the \ndefendantโs ability to make decisions about accepting mental health treatment in \nthe jail. Defendants may believe that their decisions regarding accepting mental \nhealth treatment at the jail present a risk of significant consequences since a \nfinding  of  incompetence  by  Dr.  Fithian  or  Dr.  Finnberg  could  result  in  a \ncommitment to the state hospital. Although this practice may be favored by the \nCourt in Monterey County it compromises the provision of impartial mental \nhealth services to inmate-patients.  \n \nRecommendation: it is recommended that Behavioral Health Services Manager Robert Jackson \ncommunicate to the Court that the practice of appointing Dr. Fithian and Dr. Finberg to complete \ncompetency evaluations pursuant to Penal Code 1368 is improper due to the conflict with their \nroles as treating mental health clinicians in the jail. Other members of the panel should be \nappointed to complete the competency evaluations. \n \n \n๏ท  When inmates-patients are found not competent to stand trial on felony cases they \nare committed by the Court to a state hospital. Male inmate-patients often are \ncommitted to Atascadero State Hospital and females usually are committed to \nPatton State Hospital. The court commitments include orders for involuntary \ntreatment  with  psychiatric  medication  and  most  inmate-patients  return  as \ncompetent to stand trial after they stabilize on the medications. Review of the \nrecords  indicates  that  Dr.  Fithian  frequently  continues  the  same  psychiatric \nmedications that are prescribed at the state hospital. Inmate-patients remain on a \nstatus of having court ordered treatment when they are discharged from the state \nhospital and they are involuntarily medicated by injection in the jail if they refuse \nthe  oral  medications.  The  Mental  Health  Services  program  at  the  Monterey \nCounty Jails offers voluntary treatment to inmate-patients as they are processed \nthrough trial competency procedures and continues to provide treatment for those \ninmate-patients having a court order for involuntary treatment. \n \n๏ท  Planning for continuity of care at the time of release from the jail into the \ncommunity begins when the inmate is initially evaluated by the mental health \nclinicians. Inmates that are designated as having a Serious Mental Illness (SMI) in \nthe community may already have a case manager at Behavioral Health Services. \nThe  psychiatric  nurse  contacts  the  case  manager  to  advise  that  the  client  is \nincarcerated and to begin the process of planning for housing and continuing care \nat the time of the inmate-patientโs release. Case managers may visit the inmate at \nthe jail. The case manager is responsible for continuity of care at the time of \nrelease from the jail including transportation to housing and obtaining continuing \npsychiatric medications from the community providers. Inmates that have not \nstabilized at the jail may be placed on a W&I 5150 and transported to Natividad \nMedical Center for further evaluation and treatment.

She uses a \nbrief intervention model with a focus on supporting the inmate-patient's coping \nskills. She provides crisis intervention services in the jail as needed and she assists \ninmate-patients that are suffering from insomnia, anxiety, depression or stress. \nThe  inmate  interviews  and  the  record  review  indicated  that  inmate-patients \nconsistently find her therapeutic services very helpful as they manage the multiple \nstresses of incarceration. It was noted that most of her therapeutic interventions \nare brief, which allows her to respond to a substantial number of inmates that are \nrequesting mental health services. \n \n๏ท  Although the inmate-patients housed in the administrative segregation units have \ninsufficient  socialization  opportunities  with  other  inmates  the  availability  of \ncontact  with  mental  health  clinicians  meets  the  nationally  accepted  minimal \nstandards of mental health care for inmates housed in administrative segregation \nunits.  \n \nRecommendation: it is recommended that the Sheriff adopt a policy of having Classification \nreview the status of mentally ill inmates housed in administrative segregation at least once \nmonthly to determine if the inmate can be moved to less restrictive housing. \n \n \n๏ท  The Monterey County Case Management Team meets monthly to review inmate-\npatients who require additional supportive services. The committee includes the \nJail Commander, the Behavioral Health Services Manager (Robert Jackson), Dr. \nFithian,  two  chemical  dependency  case  managers  and  the  jail  mental  health \nclinicians. The meetings focus on behavior management, treatment and continuity \nof care problems and the Team develops strategies to assist the inmate-patients \nwith improving their impulse control and to encourage acceptance of mental \nhealth  treatment.  The  Commander  provides  briefings  regarding  the  behavior \nmanagement  plans  to  the  lieutenants,  sergeants  and  deputies  responsible  for \nsupervising  inmate-patients  in  the  jail.  The  functioning  of  this  committee \nevidences a collaborative relationship between the Sheriff's staff, Correctional \nMental Health Services and the community Behavioral Health Services program. \n \n๏ท  The Mental Health Services team provides medically necessary evaluation and \ntreatment services to inmate-patients with acute mental illnesses. As inmate-\npatients  stabilize  with  treatment  they  become  eligible  for  housing  in  less \nrestrictive environments where they continue to receive mental health services. \nThe treatment system is effective, and the addition of 20 hours of mental health \n  9\n[1035449-1] \n\nCasCea5s:1e47-:c1v4--0c2v7-03207-B30L F   D  Docoucmumenetn1t-525     F Filieledd0160/1/228/1/144     P Paaggee1124 o2f  o1f9 227\n \nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document49-7   Filed04/29/14   Page14 of 79\nclinician time primarily on weekends will ensure that it meets nationally accepted \nminimum standards of correctional mental health care. All of the mental health \nclinicians that were interviewed displayed substantial enthusiasm for providing \nhigh quality care to the inmate-patients. Review of the records and interviews \nwith the inmate-patients indicate that they mostly feel respected by the mental \nhealth staff and usually are satisfied with the mental health services provided. \n \n \n3.  Review of the Suicide Prevention Program: \n \n๏ท  CHS and the Sheriff's staff deserve commendation for many positive aspects of \nthe current Suicide Prevention Plan. Any inmate that mentions suicidal ideation or \ndisplays overt signs of possible suicide risk is placed in a safe area until he or she \nis evaluated by a nurse or by mental health staff. Review of the records indicates a \nreasonably rapid response by nurses and mental health clinicians to any inmate \nrequiring an assessment for risk of suicide. The nurses and the clinicians often \nrecommend that the inmate be placed in a safety cell on suicide precautions and \nthe Sheriffโs deputies invariably comply with the recommendations. \n \n๏ท  Review of the suicide prevention training materials and logs of deputy training \nindicates that the Sheriff maintains a commitment to ensuring that the officers \nreceive appropriate training to help them identify and refer inmates that may \npresent  a  risk  of  self-harm  or  suicide,  in  addition  to  training  to  help  them \nunderstand and manage mentally disordered inmates. It was noted that suicide \nprevention training to deputies has been somewhat repetitive over the past few \nyears and a novel training program would be beneficial by providing additional \ninformation and skills. \n \nRecommendation: it is recommended that the Sheriff collaborate with Dr. Fithian and the other \nmental health clinicians to add the \"On Your Watch\" training package to the annual STC training \nfor deputies. The package is available from the California Institute for Mental Health (CIMH) in \nSacramento at a cost of less than $50. The contact person at CIMH is Gloria Hurd at 916-379-\n5326. The training package includes videos of suicidal inmates that can be used to promote \ndiscussion and role-playing regarding how to identify and talk to potentially suicidal inmates. \n \n๏ท  Identification of inmates that may be at risk of self-harm begins at Intake when \nthe booking deputy questions the arrestee and refers those with possible risk signs \nto  the  medical  nurse.  The  screening  questionnaire  contains  two  questions \ndesigned to identify arrestees with thoughts of self-harm or a history of suicidal \nbehavior.  Three  additional  questions  are  recommended  as  noted  above.  Any \narrestee with a positive response to the self-harm questions is evaluated by a \nmedical nurse who subsequently makes a referral to the licensed mental health \nclinicians. The nurses also receive annual training to help them identify signs of \npotential self-harm and they consistently referred inmate-patients to the mental \nhealth clinicians for further evaluation. There is no formal plan for encouraging \n  10\n[1035449-1] \n\nCasCea5s:1e47-:c1v4--0c2v7-03207-B30L F   D  Docoucmumenetn1t-525     F Filieledd0160/1/228/1/144     P Paaggee1134 o3f  o1f9 227\n \nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document49-7   Filed04/29/14   Page15 of 79\ninmates to report observations of other inmates in their housing area that may \nsuggest potential self-harm or suicide risk. \n \nRecommendation: it is recommended that the Sheriff collaborate with Dr. Fithian and the other \nmental health clinicians to develop a plan to encourage all inmates to report observations of other \ninmates that suggest a possible risk self-harm. The plan may include an information sheet that \ndescribes risk signs and suggests ways to report observations to the deputies. \n \n \n๏ท  Any deputies or Correctional Health Services licensed staff can initiate placement \nof an inmate displaying signs of potential self-harm in a Safety Cell at the Main \nJail. There are five Safety Cells in the Intake area. One additional Safety Cell \nlocated in the female section of the jail was not available for use at the time of the \nsite visit. The Safety Cells are padded and contain only a hole in the floor to be \nused as a toilet. Flushing is controlled externally. The Safety Cells that were \ninspected at the time of the site visit were sufficiently clean to meet minimal \nacceptable  standards.  However,  review  of  the  records  indicates  recurrent \ncomplaints by inmates that they were placed in safety cells that were filthy and \nsmelled  of  feces.  Since  Correctional  Health  Services  assumes  significant \nresponsibility for placing, monitoring and evaluating inmate-patients in the Safety \nCells, it is recommended that the Quality Management Team develop a plan for \nroutine audits of safety cell hygiene and complaints, and collaborate with Sheriff's \nstaff to ensure complete decontamination of the cells following each use.  \n \nRecommendation:  it  is  recommended  that  the  CHS  Quality  Management  Team  monitor \nproblems with the Safety Cells and collaborate with Sheriff's administration to ensure that \nsufficient cleaning and decontamination occurs following each use.  \n \n \n๏ท  Inmates  in  the  Safety  Cells  are  provided  Safety  garments  by  policy.  Inmate \ninterviews  and  review  of  the  records  indicated  that  there  were  recurrent \ncomplaints that some inmates were naked in the safety cell for many hours prior \nto receiving the safety gown. One inmate complained that he was naked for 16 \nhours before receiving the safety garment. Even if the claim was exaggerated \nthere is no justification for an inmate to be placed in a safety cell without a safety \ngarment. Inmates in safety cells also require a safety blanket that can be folded to \nprovide padding for sleep and a second safety blanket as needed for warmth. \nFailure to provide these basic necessities may increase the inmate's feelings of \ndespondency and suicidal intent. \n \nRecommendation: it is recommended that the Sheriff modify the Safety Cell Log to add a \nsection for required documentation of the time at which a safety gown is provided to the inmate \nand also the times at which one or two safety blankets are provided as needed. Safety sleeping \nbags can be utilized in lieu of the safety blankets. \n \n \n  11\n[1035449-1] \n\nCasCea5s:1e47-:c1v4--0c2v7-03207-B30L F   D  Docoucmumenetn1t-525     F Filieledd0160/1/228/1/144     P Paaggee1144 o4f  o1f9 227\n \nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document49-7   Filed04/29/14   Page16 of 79\n๏ท   Inmates in Safety Cells are checked every 15 minutes by deputies. The checks \nare documented on logs. Review of the Safety Cell logs indicated that many \ndeputy checks were out of compliance with the required frequency of two every \n30 minutes. Some logs document delays of an hour or more between checks. This \npresents an increased risk of inmate self-harm in addition to a potential liability \nfor the Sheriff.  \n \nRecommendation: it is recommended that the Sheriffs Administration develop a corrective \naction plan to ensure that safety cell checks occur twice every 30 minutes as required by the \nSheriff's policy. \n \n \n๏ท  Inmates  in  Safety  Cells  also  are  evaluated  by  CHS  staff  and  mental  health \nclinicians and their observations are noted in the health record in addition to \ndocumentation  of  their  checks  on  the  Safety  Cell  Log.  Review  of  the  logs \nindicated that nursing and mental health evaluations occurred within the time \nframes required by policy. Continued suicide watch in the Safety Cell beyond 24 \nhours must be approved by Dr. Fithian or Dr. Finnberg. Review of the logs \nindicated that most inmates were removed from suicide watch and from the safety \ncell within 72 hours. \n \n๏ท  The use of safety cells for suicide watch at the Monterey County Jail is excessive. \nIn most other correctional facilities, safety cells are used only for inmates that are \nacutely suicidal. Review of the records indicates that many of the inmates placed \non suicide watch in a safety cell reported suicidal ideation but were not acutely \nsuicidal. It is recommended that Correctional Health Services and the Sheriffโs \nAdministration collaborate to develop a suicide prevention plan that minimizes \nuse of the safety cells for suicide watch. \n \n๏ท  Recommended modifications of the Suicide Prevention Plan: the current plan \nprovides  a  comprehensive  response  to  inmates  that  verbally  express  suicidal \nideation or display self-harm behavior. However, the most lethal suicidal inmates \nusually say nothing about their suicidal thinking and are cautious to avoid any \nverbalizations that might suggest to others that they are planning to suicide. These \ninmates often can be assessed for risk of suicide by using a comprehensive suicide \nrisk assessment form. An example is provided in Appendix A. The suicide risk \nassessment form ensures that relevant factors have been considered and allows the \nmental health clinician to determine that the inmate presents a minimal, moderate \nor high risk of suicide. High risk inmates can be placed in a safety cell if there are \nindications of acute suicide risk such as statements that the inmate plans to hang \nor cut himself. High risk inmates that are not determined to be acutely suicidal by \nthe mental health clinicians can be placed in an administrative segregation cell \nthat is stripped of any items that might be used for self-harm such as bedding, \nclothing, shaving or writing instruments. The inmate must be provided with a \nsafety gown and two safety blankets to provide sufficient padding for sleep in \naddition  to  adequate  warmth.  Safety  sleeping  bags  that  are  remarkably  tear \n  12\n[1035449-1] \n\nCasCea5s:1e47-:c1v4--0c2v7-03207-B30L F   D  Docoucmumenetn1t-525     F Filieledd0160/1/228/1/144     P Paaggee1154 o5f  o1f9 227\n \nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document49-7   Filed04/29/14   Page17 of 79\nresistant also are made specifically for this purpose and they provide sufficient \nwarmth and padding in addition to being washable. Hourly checks of high risk \ninmates can be logged by the deputies and evaluations of the inmate by nursing \nand mental health clinicians can be documented at least once on their respective \nshifts. The mental health clinicians would reduce the inmate from high risk to \nmoderate risk based on their evaluations and clinical judgment in addition to \nconsultation  with  Dr.  Fithian  or  Dr.  Finnberg  if  indicated.  The  addition  of \nweekend mental health clinicians as recommended above will allow assessment of \ninmate-patients on Saturdays and Sundays and a capability of reducing their risk \nlevel and enabling early release from the safety cell. \n \n๏ท  CHS  and  the  Sheriffโs  Administration  can  collaborate  to  develop  additional \nprotocols for housing and monitoring inmates that are determined by the mental \nhealth clinicians to present a low or moderate risk of suicide. Minimal risk \ninmates may require no more than monthly mental health checks and housing \nwith other inmates, or housing where they can be monitored if they are not able to \nshare a cell. Moderate risk inmates would require weekly mental health checks \nand housing that allows increased monitoring by deputies or at least increased \ncommunication with deputies on a regular basis. \n \nRecommendation: it is recommended that the Sheriff and CHS collaborate to develop protocols \nfor housing and monitoring inmates that present a minimal, moderate or high risk of suicide as \ndescribed above. It is also recommended that the mental health clinicians complete a suicide risk \nassessment  form  for  each  inmate  at  the  time  of  the  initial  evaluation  and  at  subsequent \nevaluations if there are indications of any modification of risk factors. It is recommended that \nCorrectional Health Services develop a program for training deputies and CHS staff on the use of \nthe updated suicide prevention protocols.  \n \n \n๏ท  Inmates that have been on a moderate or high level of suicide precautions while \nincarcerated require an additional evaluation by a mental health clinician prior to \nbeing released to the community. Suicide risk levels are ideally identified in the \nSheriff's computer, which facilitates appropriate housing of these inmates and also \nalerts the release officer that the inmate requires a mental health screening prior to \nbeing released. An alternative would be to identify the risk level with color-coded \njackets that are used to contain hard copies of required custody documentation. \nThe mental health clinicians can reassess the inmate for suicide risk at the time of \nrelease and make appropriate referrals to resources as indicated by the needs of \nthe inmate. Any inmate that presents a high risk of suicide at the time of release \nmay be placed on a W&I 5150 for further evaluation and treatment at Natividad \nMedical Center. \n \n๏ท  Inmate-patients that display self-harm or assaultive behavior may be placed in the \nrestraint chair, which requires approval by a facility Sergeant. The restraint chair \nis authorized for continued restraint up to two hours and additional approval is \nrequired to continue beyond two hours with documentation of the reason for \n  13\n[1035449-1] \n\nCasCea5s:1e47-:c1v4--0c2v7-03207-B30L F   D  Docoucmumenetn1t-525     F Filieledd0160/1/228/1/144     P Paaggee1164 o6f  o1f9 227\n \nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document49-7   Filed04/29/14   Page18 of 79\ncontinued restraint. The Sheriff appropriately limits use of the restraint chair to a \nmaximum of six hours and there was no indication in the records that the chair \nwas used longer than six hours. The records also document infrequent use of the \nrestraint chair and no indication of any other type of restraints other than routine \ncuffs and belly chains. The nurse and any on-site mental health clinicians are \nnotified as soon as inmate is placed in the chair and nurses provide a medical \ncheck within a brief period of time. Mental health assessment is provided as \nneeded.  The  deputies  are  required  to  monitor  the  inmate-patients  while  in \nrestraints and document their observations twice every 30 minutes. Review of the \nrecords indicated that inmates frequently are removed from the restraint chair by \nthe end of the initial two-hour time frame or prior to the end of the second two \nhours if the restraint approval is renewed. \n \n \n4.  Review of the Health Records: \n \n๏ท  A total of 23 mental health records were reviewed. The records were selected for \nreview based on the following categories: inmate-patients with a serious mental \nillness that refuse treatment, inmate-patients with a serious mental illness that \naccept treatment, inmate-patients that attempted or completed suicide within the \npast three years, inmate-patients that have been involuntarily medicated via court \nordered treatment pursuant to P.C. 1370, inmate-patients that were involuntarily \nmedicated  due  to  emergency  conditions,  inmate-patients  that  were  placed  in \nSafety Cells and inmate-patients that were placed in the restraint chair. The health \nrecords were sufficiently thorough to meet minimal standards of documentation of \ncorrectional mental health services. Documentation of the reasons for continued \nretention in the safety cell was marginally adequate. There was sufficient CHS \ndocumentation of required nursing and mental health checks of inmate-patients \nplaced in Safety Cells, and the restraint chair.  \n \n๏ท  The records contained signed consents for mental health treatment for inmates \nthat were accepting voluntary treatment. The records contained sufficient problem \nlists to assist with the coordination of services for co-occurring medical, chemical \ndependency and mental health disorders. Progress notes consistently were signed \nand  there  were  individualized  treatment  plans  for  inmate-patients  receiving \nmental health services. There is evidence that the mental health clinicians obtain \nprior treatment records when appropriate and also coordinate continuity of care \nwith community mental health providers. The health records meet nationally \naccepted minimal standards for documentation of mental health services. \n \n๏ท  A strong quality improvement program is critical to the development of effective \ncorrectional  mental  health  services.  Correctional  Health  Services  maintains  a \nQuality Management (QM) program that includes evaluations of several aspects \nof mental health services. The QM program has completed audits of important \nindicators of successful functioning of the mental health program including the \nresponse time for inmate-patients to receive mental health evaluations and to start \n  14\n[1035449-1] \n\nCasCea5s:1e47-:c1v4--0c2v7-03207-B30L F   D  Docoucmumenetn1t-525     F Filieledd0160/1/228/1/144     P Paaggee1174 o7f  o1f9 227\n \nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document49-7   Filed04/29/14   Page19 of 79\ntheir psychiatric medications following intake. There is evidence that action plans \nresulting from chart audits and system reviews are improving the quality of \nmental health services and it can be anticipated that additional QM activities will \ncontinue to advance the quality of care.  \n \n๏ท  The QM plan also includes a peer review component with an annual review of the \npsychiatrist services by an independent psychiatrist that is not associated with \nMonterey County services. The QM program meets nationally accepted minimal \nstandards for quality improvement review of mental health services. \n \n \nSummary \n \nThe Mental Health Services program at the Monterey County correctional facilities has \nmental health clinicians who demonstrate substantial expertise and a commitment to \nprovide quality mental health care. As noted above, the mental health service suffers \nfrom understaffing and would benefit by the addition of part-time clinicians to provide an \nadditional 20 hours of mental health services primarily on weekends. Inmate-patients in \nneed of mental services are identified through multiple resources and most receive timely \nservices from professional mental health clinicians that are providing high quality care. \nThe  administrative  and  line  staff  of  Monterey  County  Sheriff  Scott  Miller  deserve \ncommendation for providing substantial support of the mental health services in addition \nto maintaining a professional level of communication that ensures effective problem \nsolving.  There  is  evidence  of  extensive  collaboration  between  Correctional  Health \nServices and Sheriffโs deputies to provide sufficient services despite limited staffing as \nnoted above. This report contains multiple recommendations for improving the quality of \nthe mental health services and CHS will need to provide training for updated protocols in \naddition  to  monitoring  the  effectiveness  of  the  modifications  through  the  Quality \nManagement program. It is my opinion that implementation of the recommendations in \nthis report will ensure that the mental health services at the Monterey County correctional \nfacilities meet all nationally accepted standards of care for correctional mental health \nprograms. \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nRichard Hayward, Ph.D. \nClinical and Forensic Psychology \nCalifornia License #PSY 4972 \n \n \n  15\n[1035449-1] \n\nCasCea5s:1e47-:c1v4--0c2v7-03207-B30L F   D  Docoucmumenetn1t-525     F Filieledd0160/1/228/1/144     P Paaggee1184 o8f  o1f9 227\n  Case5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document49-7   Filed04/29/14   Page20 of 79\nAppendix A \nSuicide Prevention Assessment Form \nName_________________________     DOB__________________________ \nAKA___________________________  ID#_________________________ \n                                                     QUESTIONS    YES     NO \n1.

Though our \ninvestigation is still ongoing, we have already identified serious violations of federal and \nCalifornia law. \nThe County of Monterey (\"the County\") and the Monterey County Sheriff's \nOffice (the \"Sheriff's Office\"), through their operation of the Jail, violate the civil rights \n685239-9 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page152 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-3   Filed06/12/14   Page3 of 12\nThe Honorable Scott Miller \nMonterey County Supervisors \nAprill5,2013 \nPage2 \nof prisoners by failing to provide reasonable accommodations to prisoners with \ndisabilities, by failing to operate an adequate medical and mental health care system, and \nby failing to protect prisoners from violence and injury at the hands of other prisoners. \nThe illegal conditions prevailing at the Jail are the direct result of the County's \ninadequate policies and practices.  In particular, the County refuses to take common \nsense, cost-effective, safety enhancing steps to ameliorate the overcrowding in the Jail, \nwhich is a root cause of many of the violations of federal and state law we have \nidentified. \nThe conditions in the Jail cause very real harm to the more than ll 00 prisoners in \nthe Jail.  From a deaf signer who has been repeatedly denied sign language interpretation \nin medical and due process settings to mentally ill prisoners forced to spend time in \nrevolting rubber rooms covered with feces to an extremely ill prisoner whose \ncolonoscopy has been poorly handled to a mobility impaired prisoner who has failed to \nreceive adequate medical care and accommodations for the nerve injury he sustained \nwhen he was attacked by another prisoner, to a prisoner with serious mental health and \nmedical issues (including diabetes, bone cancer, and fibromyalgia) who has not once \nbeen evaluated by a doctor in the six weeks she has been at the Jail, the conditions of the \nJail and the harm they cause shock the conscience. \nAt the conclusion of this letter, we propose a framework for remedying the \nconditions in the Jail and avoiding the expense and delay of protracted litigation.  If, \nhowever, the County does not agree by May 16, 2013 to a framework for resolving the \ngrave problems described below, we will have no choice but to file a lawsuit to protect \nthe rights of prisoners in the Jail. \nI.  The Jail Fails to Provide Adequate Accommodations to Prisoners with \nDisabilities Under Federal and State Law \nOur investigation has uncovered widespread violations of Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the \nCalifornia Disabled Persons Act, California Government Codeยง 11135, and relevant \nregulations interpreting those laws.  See 42 U.S.C. ยง 12131 et seq.; 29 U.S.C. ยง 794; 28 \nC.P.R.ยง 35.101 etseq.; Cal. Civ. Codeยง 54etseq.; Cal. Gov't Codeยง 11135.  The ADA \nand similar laws apply with full force to all correctional facilities, including the Jail.  See, \ne.g., Pierce v. County of Orange, 526 F.3d ll90, 1214 (9th Cir. 2008) (citing Pa. Dep't \nof Carr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 209-10 (1998)).  Put simply, the County lacks policies \nand practices necessary to ensure the accommodation of prisoners with disabilities, and, \nas a result, routinely discriminates against prisoners with disabilities in violation of state \nand federal law. \n685239ยท8 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page153 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-3   Filed06/12/14   Page4 of 12\nThe Honorable Scott Miller \nMonterey County Supervisors \nAprill5, 2013 \nPage3 \nTo begin with, the Jail does not adequately screen incoming prisoners to determine \nwhether they have disabilities that require accommodations.  In addition, the Jail does not \nmaintain a central list, electronic or otherwise, of prisoners with disabilities and the \naccommodations they require.  See Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F. 3d 849, 876 (9th Cir. \n2001) (prison system's lack of disability tracking system violates the ADA).  The Jail's \nfailure to identify and track prisoners with disabilities contributes to pervasive violations \nof prisoners' rights under federal and state disability laws. \nThe Jail has no mechanism for providing notice to prisoners of their rights under \nthe ADA, as required by federal regulation.  See 28 C.F.R. ยง 35.106.  The Jail also lacks \nan adequate grievance procedure for prisoners to request accommodations while \nincarcerated, as required by 28 C.F.R. ยง 35.107(b).  Prisoners have reported problems \nobtaining grievance forms, which are controlled by staff.  Our interviews with prisoners \nand review of custody files indicate that even when prisoners are able to submit a \ngrievance about disability-related issues, they frequently receive delayed or incomplete \nresponses or no response at all. \nThe Jail routinely fails to provide accommodations to prisoners with hearing, \nvision, speech, and other impairments that affect communication.  See 28 C.F.R. \nยง 35.160.  Specifically, the Jail rarely, if ever, provides prisoners with sign language \ninterpreters, hearing aids, or other auxiliary aids to ensure that prisoners with disabilities \ncan effectively communicate with custody and medical staff.  This failure to ensure \neffective communication affects access to nearly every program and service offered by \nthe Jail, including the booldng process, telephones, disciplinary proceedings, religious \nservices, recreational programs, medical and mental health care, and educational and \nvocational programs.  For example, at a medical appointment for a hearing impaired \nprisoner who primarily communicates using American Sign Language, medical staff not \nonly refused his request for a sign language interpreter, but also refused the prisoner's \nalternative request to communicate using written notes.  Instead, the staff member forced \nthe prisoner to read lips, which the prisoner is unable to do, leaving him unable to \nunderstand most of what the staff member conveyed during the medical visit and placing \nthe prisoner at a significant risk of misdiagnosis and harm.  This same prisoner was also \nfound guilty of a disciplinary infraction and sanctioned at a hearing in which he was \nunable to effectively participate because he was denied a sign language interpreter. \nIn the course of the investigation, we learned that the Jail, in violation of 28 C.F.R. \nยง 35.152, frequently fails to provide prisoners with disabilities with safe and accessible \nhousing.  Only a few areas of the Jail have accessible showers and toilets.  The Jail lacks \nadequate policies and practices to ensure that prisoners who require such facilities are \nplaced and retained in these accessible housing units.  For example, a wheelchair-bound \n685239ยท9 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page154 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-3   Filed06/12/14   Page5 of 12\nThe Honorable Scott Miller \nMonterey County Supervisors \nAprill5, 2013 \nPage4 \nprisoner who was assigned to a housing unit that lacked toilets and showers with grab \nbars fell repeatedly trying to take care of his basic needs and hygiene.  Moreover, the \nexercise yard for the Rotunda, all of the Pods, the clinic, and the Women's Section of the \nJail can only be accessed by traveling up one long flight and then down a shorter flight of \nstairs.  The Jail routinely houses prisoners with mobility impairments in these units even \nthough these architectural barriers deny such prisoners access to the yard. \nThe Jail often refuses to provide assistive devices--including but not limited to \nwheelchairs, walkers, crutches, canes, braces, tapping canes, hearing aids, and pocket \ntalkers-to prisoners with disabilities.  Without such accommodations, prisoners are \nunable to move around the Jail and access the Jail's programs and services, in violation of \nthe ADA.  See 28 C.F.R. ยง 35.130.  As an example, one prisoner, who required, but was \ndenied, a wheelchair, was forced to have other prisoners carry him to and from the toilet \nand shower. \nThe Jail's woefully inadequate program for accommodating prisoners with \ndisabilities not only denies prisoners access to programs and services, it threatens their \nsafety and well-being.  Prisoners with unidentified and unaccommodated disabilities are \nat greater risk of harm in the case of emergencies, including fires, alarms, and \nearthquakes.  Such prisoners are also at increased risk of exploitation by other prisoners \nas a result of their need to rely upon other prisoners for assistance to access basic \nservices. \nII.  The Jail Fails to Provide Adequate Health Care to Prisoners \nThe Eight and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and \nArticle I, Sections 7 and 17 to the California Constitution, require the County to provide \nadequate health care to all prisoners in the Jail.  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 \n(1976); see also In re Alva, 33 Cal. 4th 254, 291 (2004).  Our investigation has uncovered \ndistressing evidence of a manifestly unconstitutional health care system, in which the \nCounty is deliberately indifferent to the medical and mental health care needs of its \nprisoners.1 \n1 It is our understanding that the County contracts with California Forensic \nMedical Group (\"CFMG\") to provide medical and mental health care to prisoners in the \nJail.  The County is nonetheless liable for all constitutional violations suffered by \nprisoners, whether those violations were caused by County personnel or employees of \nCFMG.  West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 56 (1988). \n655239ยท9 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page155 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-3   Filed06/12/14   Page6 of 12\nThe Honorable Scott Miller \nMonterey County Supervisors \nAprill5, 2013 \nPageS \n\"A prison that deprives prisoners of basic sustenance, including adequate medical \ncare, is incompatible with the concept of human dignity and has no place in civilized \nsociety.\" Brown v. Plata, 131 S. Ct. 1910, 1928 (2011). \nA.  Inadequate Mental Health Care \nThe County violates prisoners' rights under the federal and state constitutions by \nfailing to provide adequate mental health care.  The minimum elements of a \nconstitutional mental health system are: \n(l) a systematic program for screening and evaluating inmates to identify \nthose in need of mental health care; (2) a treatment program that involves \nmore than segregation and close supervision of mentally ill inmates; \n(3) employment of a sufficient number of trained mental health \nprofessionals; (4) maintenance of accurate, complete and confidential \nmental health treatment records; (5) administration of psychotropic \nmedication only with appropriate supervision and periodic evaluation; and \n(6) a basic program to identify, treat, and supervise inmates at risk for \nsuicide. \nColeman v. Brown, S-90-520 LKK/JFM, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50900, at *55-56 (E.D. \nCal. Apr. 5, 2013) (quoting Coleman v. Wilson, 912 F. Supp. 1282, 198 n.lO (E.D. Cal. \n1995), citing Balla v. Idaho, 595 F. Supp. 1558 (D. Idaho 1984)). \nThe mental health care system in Monterey County Jail falls far short of these \nminimum standards.  The Jail's screening and evaluation processes fail to identify \nnumerous prisoners with serious mental illness.  From our interviews and review of \ncustody and medical files, it appears that mental health care treatment in the Jail consists \nalmost entirely of medication.  Therapy, on either a group or individual basis, is nearly \nnon-existent.  Contrary to law, prisoners with mental illness are segregated from the \ngeneral population and placed in the A and B Pods for men and the R and S Pods for \nwomen.  Prisoners in these Pods are frequently denied access to programs and services \nincluding day room access and yard-from which other prisoners benefit.  Though \nmedication constitutes the primary mechanism of treatment in the Jail, all medications, \nincluding psychotropic medications, are provided to prisoners in an inconsistent manner; \nmedications are frequently changed or discontinued without medical justification. \nMost troublingly, the Jail's program for supervising prisoners at risk of suicide is \npatently deficient.  Among the most shocking discoveries is theJ ail's regular placement \nof prisoners in mental health care crisis (and for that matter, prisoners who are simply \n68523g.g \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page156 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-3   Filed06/12/14   Page7 of 12\nThe Honorable Scott Miller \nMonterey County Supervisors \nApril15, 2013 \nPage 6 \nmisbehaving) in \"rubber rooms.\"  These \"rubber rooms,\" which lack any furniture or \nfeatures save for a grate in the floor which serves as the toilet, are punitive, anti \ntherapeutic, disgusting, and inhumane.  The floors (on which prisoners sleep, urinate, and \ndefecate) and walls of the \"mbber rooms\" are frequently covered in feces. \nThe shortcomings in the Jail's mental health care system have had tragic \nconsequences.  Over the past three years, there have been two completed and more than a \ndozen attempted suicides.  The rate of completed suicides at the Jail significantly exceeds \nthe national average for local jails. \nIn addition, many prisoners in the Jail suffer from obvious, untreated psychiatric \nproblems.  One prisoner, who had been found incompetent to stand trial because of his \nmental illness, did not receive any medications for his first 10 days in the Jail; as a result, \nhe became depressed and began to hear voices.  Another prisoner simply asked to see a \nmental health clinician, and was placed naked in a rubber room for a significant period of \ntime.  Other prisoners we interviewed were floridly psychotic during our meetings and \nclearly were not receiving adequate mental health care treatment. \nB.  Inadequate Medical Care \nThe County routinely and systemically violates the federal and state constitutional \nrights of prisoners by failing to provide minimally adequate medical care. \nThe Jail's screening process is inadequate for identifying prisoners with serious \nand chronic medical issues; as a result, many prisoners receive no treatment for serious \nconditions for significant periods of time (if ever) after being booked into the jail. Even \nwhen the Jail identifies a new prisoner with chronic or serious medical concerns, the Jail \nfrequently refuses to continue the prescribed treatment the prisoner was receiving.  In \nparticular, the Jail employs a remarkably punitive \"detox protocol\" for prisoners who \narrive at the Jail, refusing to provide prisoners with pain medication prescribed by their \noutside doctors.  See Hamilton v. Endell, 981 F.2d 1062, 1066-67 (9th Cir. 1992), \nabrogated in part on other grounds by Ford v. Ramirez-Palmer (Estate of Ford), 301 \nF.3d 1043, 1045 (9th Cir. 2002) (deliberate indifference to ignore outside doctors without \nmedical justification).  Prisoners placed on the \"detox protocol\" suffer from intense, \nuntreated pain as well as powerful, dangerous, and unnecessary withdrawal symptoms. \nThe Jail also has a systemic practice of delaying necessary treatments until \nprisoners are released in order to avoid the expense of treatment.  This is particularly true \nwhen the care required by a prisoner involves referral to an outside medical provider. \n68523g.g \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page157 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-3   Filed06/12/14   Page8 of 12\nThe Honorable Scott Miller \nMonterey County Supervisors \nApril15, 2013 \nPage 7 \nThese and other practices violate established precedent governing adequate medical care. \nSee LeMarbe v. Wisneski, 266 F.3d 429, 440 (6th Cir. 2001). \nPrisoners have difficulty requesting assistance through the sick call procedure, and \noften experience substantial delays before being seen by an appropriate medical provider. \nSee Hoptowit v. Ray, 682 F.2d 1237, 1253 (9th Cir. 1982) (medical care is deficient when \nprisoners are unable to make their needs known to medical and mental health care staff). \nAs a result, medical issues often go untreated for weeks or months.  See lett v. Penner, \n439 F. 3d 1091, 1096 (9th Cir. 2006) (deliberate indifference \"may appear when prison \nofficials deny, delay or intentionally interfere with medical treatment\") (quotation marks \nand citations omitted).  It is our understanding that the inability of patients to be seen in a \ntimely manner is both a product of the Jail's overcrowding (discussed below) as well as \nthe County's refusal to hire sufficient health care workers.  See Anderson v. Atlanta, 778 \nF.2d 678, 685-89 (11th Cir. 1985) (deliberate indifference where insufficient number of \nmedical professionals employed to provide care). \nWhen prisoners are able to meet with medical staff, staff routinely fail to address \nthe prisoners' concerns or fail to provide care when care is medically indicated.  See lett, \n439 F.3d at 1098 (deliberate indifference where correctional facility refused to provide \nmedically indicated treatment). \nThese policies and practices have resulted in significant harm to numerous \nprisoners.  We are aware that the Jail has been prone to several outbreaks of infectious \ndisease, including scabies, measles, and staph infections.  At least three prisoners with \ncolostomies did not receive appropriate supplies or follow-up treatment, including \nreversal procedures, while at the Jail.  Prisoners who arrive at the Jail with serious \nchronic medical issues, including ulcerative colitis, a rare stomach fungus, and high \nblood pressure, consistently reported delays or lack of appropriate treatment.  Other \nprisoners reported that the Jail was refusing to provide them with prescribed medications, \nsome of which the prisoners had been taldng for years to manage chronic issues.  Many \nprisoners described patently insufficient treatment for traumatic injuries; for example, \none prisoner, who had his collar bone fractured by a Jail deputy, received no treatment \nfor his injury other than an ice pack for four days.  Another prisoner received no \ntreatment for vaginal bleeding that occurred for two months.  A number of prisoners \nreceived grossly inadequate treatment after being released from the hospital back to the \nJail. \n685239-9 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page158 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-3   Filed06/12/14   Page9 of 12\nThe Honorable Scott Miller \nMonterey County Supervisors \nApril15, 2013 \nPage 8 \nIII.  The Jail Fails to Protect Prisoners from Harm \nPursuant to the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and \nArticle I, Sections 7 and 17 of the California Constitution, the County must \"take \nreasonable measures to guarantee the safety of the inmates.\"  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 \nU.S. 825, 832 (1970).  The County violates the constitutional rights of inmates because it \n\"knows that inmates face a substantial risk of serious harm and disregards that risk by \nfailing to take reasonable measures to abate it.\" !d. at 847. \nPrisoners housed in Monterey County Jail face a constitutionally unacceptable risk \nof violence from other prisoners.  Our review of Monterey County Jail Incident Reports \nfor January 2011 to September 2012 indicates that scores of prisoners are attacked and \ninjured by other prisoners.  Most of the incidents require medical attention for at least one \nof the participants, either at the Jail or the local hospital.  These incidents occur in almost \nevery area of the Jail, including housing units, the kitchen, infirmary, and visiting area. \nViolent incidents talce place among male prisoners and female prisoners at approximately \nthe same rate.  Jail staff almost never intervene to stop incidents of prisoner violence \nbefore they are complete.  Moreover, in many cases, Jail staff never identify the \nassailants. \nRather than take steps to mitigate the risk of violence, Jail officials, through their \ndeliberate policy choices, create the environment in which violence flourishes.  The \nCounty has elected to operate the Jail with an insufficient number of officers, accepting \nthe risk that its staff will not be able to monitor and protect all prisoners.  As is discussed \nin more detail below, the Jail is extraordinarily overcrowded, which makes it \nconsiderably more difficult for the County to protect prisoners from violence.  The Jail \nitself is a patchwork of malceshift spaces, thrown together to keep up with Monterey's \nfast-growing Jail populations.  Consequently, throughout the housing units and other \nspaces, there are numerous blind spots where staff cannot safely monitor prisoners.  And \nfinally, the Jail does not adequately classify and assign prisoners to housing locations in \nthe Jail where they will be safe from injury and violence.  Prisoners who are \nincompatible, including because of rival gang memberships and/or histories of assaultive \nbehaviors, are regularly housed together in the Jail. \nIV.  The County Refuses to Utilize Available Solutions to Reduce Overcrowding in \nthe Jail \nEach of the constitutional and statutory violations discussed above are caused, at \nleast in part, by the severely overcrowded conditions in the Jail.  As the United States \nSupreme Court has explained: \n685239ยท9 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page159 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-3   Filed06/12/14   Page10 of 12\nThe Honorable Scott Miller \nMonterey County Supervisors \nAprill5, 2013 \nPage9 \nCrowding ... creates unsafe and unsanitary living conditions that hamper \neffective delivery of medical and mental health care....  Cramped \nconditions promote unrest and violence, maldng it difficult for prison \nofficials to monitor and control the prison population ....  [O]vercrowding \nmay prevent immediate medical attention necessary to avoid suffering, \ndeath, or spread of disease ....  Living in crowded, unsafe, and unsanitary \nconditions can cause prisoners with latent mental illnesses to worsen and \ndevelop overt symptoms.  Crowding may also impede efforts to improve \ndelivery of care. \nPlata, 131 S. Ct. at 1933-34 (citations omitted). \nThese conditions prevail in the Jail; as Monterey County Civil Grand Jury \nconcluded, \"[t]he County Jail is suffering a condition of gross overcrowding.\"  The Jail \nhas a rated capacity for 829 prisoners, but has in the recent past housed as many as 1200 \nprisoners, nearly 150 percent of capacity.  Some areas of the Jail are considerably more \novercrowded than the Jail as a whole, especially in the Women's Section. \nCounty officials have repeatedly acknowledged the severity of the Jail's \novercrowding problem.  For many years now, Monterey County has applied on a monthly \nbasis to the Superior Court for the County of Monterey for an order to release prisoners \non an accelerated basis pursuant to California Penal Code section 4024.1.  To support the \napplications, the former Chief Deputy Sheriff for the County has sworn on multiple \noccasions that unless the Jail is able to release some inmates, the overcrowding in the Jail \nwould \"compromise[] the inmate classification plan as well as the safety and security of \nthe detention facilities.\"  In support of the applications, Dr. Taylor Fithian, Director of \nCFMG, \"advised that the excessive number of inmates housed in the Jail compromises \nthe health of the inmates and the staff worldng at the facility.\"  As recently as late 2012, \nSheriff Miller stated that \"[o  ]vercrowding has been a serious problem at the jail for many \nyears, creating a dangerous situation for inmates, jail staff and the community.\" \nDespite the profound and persistent overcrowding, the County has not availed \nitself of all opportunities to reduce the Jail population.  In particular, the County fails to \nutilize any form of pre-trial risk assessment for all but a handful of detained defendants, \nrefuses to expand capacity for its existing work release program for sentenced \nindividuals, and has failed to investigate opportunities for collaboration between agencies \nto expand its capacity to supervise individuals on mandatory community supervision as \npart of a split sentence.  If the County used these policies and programs to reduce the \nJail's census, the population in the Jail would quickly fall below the Jail's rated capacity \nwithout harm to public safety. \n685239ยท9 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page160 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-3   Filed06/12/14   Page11 of 12\nThe Honorable Scott Miller \nMonterey County Supervisors \nApril 15, 2013 \nPage 10 \nInstead, the County has unwisely decided to try building its way out of its \novercrowding problem.  In the fall, the County announced plans to expand the Jail at a \ncost of more than $40 million; this project will not be completed until2017 at the earliest. \nAnd most recently, Sheriff Miller announced that the County was planning to send as \nmany as 50 prisoners to be housed in Alameda County Jail because the Monterey County \nJail is too overcrowded; this program will cost a minimum of $1.5 million annually. \nThese proposed expenditures amount to a needless waste of public funds.  Moreover, \nthey will do little to alleviate the illegal conditions in the existing Jail facilities. \nV.  Framework for Ameliorating the Illegal Conditions in the Jail \nThe violations of state and federal law we have identified must be remedied, and \nthe unnecessary suffering of prisoners in the Jail must come to an end.  To achieve that \nend without the need for costly and protracted litigation, we propose entering into an \nenforceable agreement with certain minimum criteria. \nFirst and most importantly, the agreement would provide for a process of retaining \nmutually agreeable neutral experts to review the Jail's practices with respect to \naccommodations for prisoners with disabilities, medical and mental healthcare, \novercrowding, and violence.  Within 120 days of the appointment of the experts, they \nwould issue reports proposing standards and remediation for conditions found to be \nbelow the minimum federal and state standards. \nSecond, at the same time that the experts are reviewing Jail policies and practices, \ncounty officials must agree to engage in serious efforts consistent with law and public \nsafety to reduce crowding at the jail, including implementing pre-trial services and \nalternatives to incarceration for the individuals who present the lowest risk and stand to \nbenefit significantly from accessing employment, education, substance abuse treatment, \nand other services only available in the community. The county should also investigate \nthe possibility of utilizing split sentencing to a greater extent.  These and other measures \nwould be expected to reduce the jail population significantly over the next six to nine \nmonths. \nThird, the settlement process must ultimately result in a settlement agreement filed \nwith the court and over which the court retains continuing jurisdiction. The agreement \nwould require that the County, where necessary to comply with state and federal law, \nrevise policies and procedures, implement a system for quality control, and permit \noutside monitoring of conditions. \n685239-9 \n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page161 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-3   Filed06/12/14   Page12 of 12\nThe Honorable Scott Miller \nMonterey County Supervisors \nApril 15, 2013 \nPage 11 \nPlease let us know as soon as possible whether the County is open to pre-litigation \ndiscussions consistent with this letter.  If we do not agree on a framework for resolution \nby May 16,2013, we will have no choice but to file a complaint seeking declaratory and \ninjunctive relief to ameliorate the illegal conditions in the Jail. \nVery truly yours, \nROSEN BIEN  MONTEREY COUNTY OFFICE OF \nGALVAN & GRUNFELD LLP  THE PUBLIC DEFENDER \nIs/ Gay Crosthwait Grunfeld  Is/ James Egar \nBy:  Gay Crosthwait Grunfeld  By:  James Egar \nGCG:amc \ncc:  (by Federal Express) \nCharles J.

My opinions set forth below are based upon the documents and other\n2 evidence listed above and on my professional knowledge and my experiences working in\n3 ~ correctional settings.\n4 5.  This case is still in a very early stage. I am informed that the parties have not\n5 yet exchanged any formal discovery. For example, I have not conducted any inspection of\n6 the Jail facilities, I have not interviewed any staff or prisoners, and I have only reviewed a\n7'. small number of records for the named plaintiffs. As a result, I have not been able to form\n8 opinions regarding certain elements of the mental health care system at the Jail. For\n9 example, at the present time, I do not have access to the information necessary to form\n10 opinions regarding whether Defendants maintain appropriate medical records. I would\n11 expect to consider this and other issues not addressed in this report in the future once\n12 Plaintiffs propound discovery. Based upon the documents and information I have\n13 reviewed, however, I am able to offer the following preliminary opinions. I reserve the\n14 right to supplement or modify these opinions as more information becomes available.\n15 6.  From my preliminary review, it is my opinion that the mental health care\n16 program at the Jail is not sufficient to meet prisoners' serious mental health needs and\n17 needlessly places prisoners in the Jail at a substantial risk of serious harm. The serious,\n18 system-wide problems with the mental health care system at the Jail include the following:\n19 โข  Defendants fail to staff the Jail with sufficient mental health, medical, and\n20 custody staff to deliver timely and appropriate mental health care to\n21 prisoners with serious mental illness.\n22 โข  Defendants' intake processes are inadequate, in that they fail to adequately\n23 identify prisoners with mental illness booked into the Jail and also fail to\n24 appropriately continue care that prisoners were receiving in the community.\n25 โข  Defendants lack an effective and timely mechanism for prisoners to request\n26 mental health care services.\n27 โข  Defendants fail to appropriately and safely manage and monitor the\n28 administration of psychotropic medication.\n(i~ao~ea-~  II  ~  CV 13 2354 PSG\nDECL.

As I discuss below, it is my opinion that, collectively and individually, these\n19 problems place all prisoners at a substantial risk of serious harm. Any prisoner, whether\n20 they enter the Jail with a diagnosed mental illness or not, may develop symptoms of mental\n21 illness while in the Jail. This is especially true given the harsh, overcrowded conditions in\n22 the Jail. And any prisoner with mental illness in the Jail is endangered by Defendants'\n23 problematic policies and practices, which do not ensure that prisoners receive timely,\n24 appropriate, and effective mental health care. Consequently, all prisoners, not just\n25 prisoners with diagnosed mental illness, are placed at great risk of serious harm by\n26 Defendants' deficient mental health care system.\n27\n28\n[11407847] 4  CV 13 2354 PSG\nDECL.

From the information I have reviewed, it is my opinion that the County and\n4 CFMG do not employ sufficient mental health care, medical, and custody staff to ensure\n5 ~ prisoners receive mental health care in a timely and appropriate manner. Defendants'\n6 ~ understaffing affects all prisoners in the Jail, especially those who have serious mental\n7 illness.\n8 9.  The number of mental health care clinicians employed at the Jail is not\n9 ~ adequate to deliver mental health care to prisoners in the Jail. As part of the contract for\n10 CFMG to provide medical, mental health, and dental services to prisoners at the Jail,\n11 Defendants developed a staffing plan for the Jail. Pursuant to the staffing plan, CFMG\n12 employs three staff members who provide mental health services to prisoners: a\n13 Psychiatrist who works 15 hours a week, a Licensed Clinical Social\n14 Worker/Psychologist/Marriage and Family Therapist who works 20 hours a week, and a\n15 psychiatric registered nurse who works 40 hours per week. See Grunfeld Decl., Ex. H.\n16 According to the staffing plan, collectively there are 1.88 Full-time Equivalent( \"FTE\")\n17 positions for mental health care staff at the Jail.\n18 10.  Dr. Richard Hayward, Ph.D., was jointly retained by the parties to conduct\n19 an evaluation of the mental health care system at the Jail. In his draft report summarizing\n20 his findings, Dr. Hayward indicated that he was informed that CFMG employs four\n21 employees to provide mental health treatment to prisoners: Dr. Taylor Fithian, a\n22 psychiatrist who works about 25 hours a week in the Jail, Dr. Elaine Finnberg, Ph.D., a\n23 psychologist who works 20 hours per week in the Jail, Charlotte Gage, R.N., a registered\n24 nurse who works 40 hours per week at the Jail, and Kim Spano, L.M.F.T., a licensed\n25 marriage and family therapist who works 40 hours per week. See Grunfeld Decl., Ex. O, at\n26 4. According to Dr. Hayward, collectively there are 3.125 FTE positions for mental health\n27 care staff at the Jail.\n28 11.  Regardless of whether the Defendants staff the Jail at the level indicated in\n[~~ao~ea-~  I  5  CV 13 2354 PSG\nDECL. OF PABLO STEWART ISO PLS.'

In his draft report, Dr. Hayward described a\n4 shortage of mental health care clinicians and the risks the shortage poses to prisoners. He\n5 found that CFMG needed to add an additional 0.5 FTE staffing for a mental health\n6 clinician in addition to the psychiatrist and psychologist \"to provide a minimally adequate\n7 ~ level of mental health services ...\" at the Jail. See id. Dr. Hayward found that the\n8'~ additional staff is necessary for Defendants to \"provide mental health intake assessments,\n9 crisis intervention services, evaluations of inmates in the safety cells or the restraint chair\n10 and supportive counseling to seriously mentally ill inmate-patients housed in the\n11 administrative segregation pods.\" See Grunfeld Decl., Ex. M, at 5.\n12 12.  Dr. Hayward also identifies as a problem that there are no mental health\n13 ~ care clinicians on site at the Jail on weekends and holidays. See id. at 2, 5. One\n14 consequence of this staffing deficiency is that prisoners who require acute psychiatric\n15 services on weekends remain in the Jail, largely untreated, until the mental health\n16 clinicians arrive on Monday. My review of the declaration for Plaintiff Brandon Mefford,\n17 a prisoner who Defendants knew suffered from serious mental illness, indicates that this is\n18 exactly what happened to him. He was identified as being in mental health crisis on a\n19 Friday afternoon at about 3:00 P.M. Over the weekend, Plaintiff Mefford was not seen by\n20 any mental health care staff and was housed in a safety cell (sometimes being placed in a\n21 restraint chair with belly chains and a helmet) or a booking cell. He was not seen by a\n22 mental health clinician until Monday. This lack of qualified mental health staff on-site on\n23 weekends poses a serious risk to prisoners who are suicidal. Any prisoners, newly booked\n24 or otherwise, who present with any mental health needs on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday\n25 will be at risk for deterioration of his or her condition and needless suffering over the\n26 weekend without mental health care staffing. Accordingly, I agree with Dr. Hayward that\n27 the understaffing of mental health clinicians at the Jail results in inadequate mental health\n28 care services for prisoners in the Jail.\n[11407847]  II  ~  CV 13 2354 PSG\nDECL.

In order to provide minimally adequate mental health care to prisoners in the\n2 Jail, Defendants will, for the following reasons, need to add significantly more than 0.5\n3 FTE mental health clinicians to the staff.\n4 14.  To begin with, Dr. Hayward's recommendation for additional staffing did\n5 ~ not include a relief factor. See Grunfeld Decl., Ex. O, at 4. A relief factor indicates how\n6 ~ many FTEs it takes to fill a position, taking into account the inevitable absences of\n7 ~ employees for vacation, sickness, leave, and training. Any evaluation of staffing that does\n8 not include a relief factor necessarily underestimates the minimum amount of necessary\n9 staff.\n10 15.  More importantly, Dr. Hayward's recommendation appears to be based upon\n11 ~ an under-estimation of the needs of prisoners for mental health care services. Dr. Hayward\n12 explained that Defendants house prisoners with the most serious mental illness in\n13 administrative segregation: A and B Pods for men, and R and S Pods for women. See\n14 Grunfeld Decl., Ex. M, at 6. He also explained that his staffing recommendation was\n15 based on the Jail needing to provide socialization groups to those prisoners once per week\n16 for one hour. See Grunfeld Decl., Ex. M, at 7. It is my opinion that one hour of structured\n17 out-of-cell time once per week for prisoners who are \"not stabilized\" falls far below the\n18 standard of care and is insufficient to provide adequate psychiatric therapy to prisoners\n19 who have serious mental illness. Dr. Hayward's estimate for additional needed staff does\n20 not take into account the need for significantly greater group therapy offerings necessary to\n21 meet the standard of care.\n22 16.  It is my opinion that Defendants also do not staff the Jail with sufficient\n23 ~ medical staff, placing all prisoners, including prisoners with serious mental illness, at risk\n24 of significant harm. Dr. Mike Puisis, who evaluated the quality of medical care provided\n25 in the Jail as a joint expert for the parties, found that the staffing pattern for providing\n26 medical care in the Jail \"is not capable of accomplishing all assigned duties ....\" Grunfeld\n27 Decl., Ex.

See Grunfeld Decl.,\n5 ~ Ex. M, at 1-4. The shortages of medical providers identified by Dr. Puisis would\n6 ~ necessarily have an impact on the ability of prisoners to receive timely, adequate mental\n7 health care in the Jail.\n8 17.  It is my opinion that Defendants also do not staff the Jail with sufficient\n9 ~ custody staff to ensure the timely delivery of appropriate mental health care, which affects\n10 all prisoners in the Jail. Each of the experts who reviewed staffing found that custody\n11 staffing was insufficient to complete all necessary tasks. Dr. Hayward found that custody\n12 staff frequently failed to make required safety checks of prisoners in safety cells twice\n13 every thirty minutes, as required by Sheriff's Office and CFMG policies, a deficiency\n14 possibly caused by lack of sufficient staff. See id. at 12. Dr. Puisis concluded that custody\n15 staffing in the Jail was insufficient to adequately facilitate the provision of medical care to\n16 prisoners. See Grunfeld Decl., Ex. J, at 3( \"Because there are limitations with respect to\n17 officers transporting inmates for their scheduled appointments, officer staffing should be\n18 evaluated along with medical staffing.\"). Michael Hackett, who evaluated the safety in the\n19 Jail as a joint expert for the parties, also concluded that custody staffing at the Jail was\n20 inadequate in a number of respects. See generally Grunfeld Decl., Ex. I, at ยถ~ 3.1-.14. In\n21 addition, TRG Consulting, who produced a Jail Needs Assessment for the County and\n22 Sheriff s Office in December 2011, also found that the Jail employed nowhere near enough\n23 custody staff to, among other things, \"provide medical care ... and move inmates within\n24 the facility.\" Second Am. Compl., Ex. B (Dkt. No. 41), at EX. 6.\n25 18.  These custody staffing shortages create serious problems for all prisoners.\n26 For example, many of the named plaintiffs were unable, at some point during their time in\n27 the Jail, to receive needed medical treatment because of the unavailability of custody staff.\n28 19.  In my experience, mental health care staff members in correctional settings\n[11407847] g  CV 13 2354 PSG\nDECL. OF PABLO STEWART ISO PLS.'

Among\n2 ~ other critical tasks, custody staff members escort prisoners to and from mental health care\n3 ~ treatment and monitor prisoners with mental illness in administrative segregation and in\n4 ~ safety cells. Custody staff is also responsible for supervising prisoners on the exercise\n5 ~ yard, in the day room, and for other programs and activities. The shortages of custody\nstaff identified by Drs. Puisis and Hayward and by Mr. Hackett and TRG Consulting\n7 necessarily impede the delivery of mental health care and the provision of other activities.\n8 It is thus my opinion that the Jail's failure to employ sufficient custody staff to ensure that\n9 prisoners with mental illness receive the care that they require affects all prisoners at the\n10 Jail.\n11 20.  Without more information regarding the incidence and acuity of mental\n12 ~ illness in the Jail population, I cannot provide a recommendation regarding the quantity of\n13 additional mental health care and medical clinicians and custody staff necessary to provide\n14 adequate mental health care to prisoners in the Jail I am, however, confident that, as\n15 found by Dr. Hayward, Defendants currently do not staff the Jail with sufficient mental\n16 health clinicians to ensure that prisoners receive the mental health treatment they require. I\n17 am also confident that Dr. Hayward's estimateโthat an additional 0.5 FTE for mental\n18 health clinicians would result in minimally adequate mental health care staffis too low,\n19 likely by a significant amount.\n20 21.  Lack of sufficient mental health, medical, and custody staff inevitably has a\n21 negative impact on the quality and quantity of the mental health care delivered to\n22 prisoners. An understaffed facility, and particularly one that appears to be as understaffed\n23 ~ as the Jail, is simply not capable of providing all of the mental health care services that\n24 prisoners require. The problems caused by understaffing are exacerbated by the\n25 overcrowding in the Jail, which I discuss below. As a result of the lack of sufficient\n26 mental health, medical, and custody staff at the Jail, all prisoners with, or who may\n27 develop, mental illness, are placed at serious risk of substantial harm.\n28\n[11407847)  II  9  CV 13 2354 PSG\nDECL.

One of the most important functions of a jail mental health care system is to\n5 ensure that newly booked prisoners quickly receive the mental health care services they\n6 require. For prisoners who were receiving mental health treatment up to the time of their\n7 arrest, a jail must identify the nature of the person's mental illness, the types of treatments\nthey were receiving in the community, and ensure such treatment is continued unless a\n9 provider makes a reasonable clinical determination to discontinue or change treatment\n10 following aface-to-face assessment of the patient. For prisoners who were not receiving\n11 treatment in the community, a jail must determine whether the person suffers from mental\n12 illness and devise an appropriate treatment plan. The Jail's intake process fails to ensure\n13 that necessary mental health treatment is continued or initiated.\n14 23.  Any failure to quickly diagnose new prisoners' mental illnesses, identify\n15 their community mental health treatment (if any), and devise an appropriate treatment plan\n16 for their time in the Jail, can have devastating consequences. As is discussed more fully\n17 below, prisoners with mental illness who are introduced to a Jail environment are, for a\n18 number of reasons, at a heightened risk of suicide; any delay in identifying such prisoners\n19 and mitigating that risk can result in self-harm and attempted or completed suicide. In\n20 addition, and as is also discussed more fully below, for those prisoners who were taking\n21 psychotropic medications in the community, any interruption of medication can cause a\n22 prisoner to mentally decompensate, may result in a permanent worsening of their\n23 underlying mental illness, and may make future treatment more difficult and potentially\n24 less efficacious.\n25 24.  The intake process is also important for ensuring that prisoners are placed in\n26 appropriate jail housing. Prisoners with unstable mental illness should be placed into\n27 housing units capable of addressing their mental health needs. And prisoners who are at\n28 risk of suicide must be placed in suicide-safe housing, in which suicide hazards have been\n[11407847] CV 13 2354 PSG\nDECL. OF PABLO STEWART ISO PLS.'

The Jail's intake process fails to\n2 ~ ensure that mentally ill prisoners are appropriately housed after intake.\n3 25.  The policies and practices at the Jail for identifying newly-booked prisoners\n4 ~ with mental illness and ensuring they receive appropriate treatment and housing are\n5 ~ inadequate in a number of respects. Pursuant to Sheriff's Office and CFMG policy, the\n6 ~ process of identifying prisoners with mental illness and their mental health needs occurs in\n7 three steps. First, during the booking process, custody staff completes an Intake Health\n8 Screening form for all prisoners. Second, for prisoners identified as receiving psychiatric\n9 medications, medical staff is supposed to conduct an Intake Triage Assessment\n10 immediately. And third, if medical staff refers a patient for a psychiatric evaluation, a\n11 psychiatrist is supposed to assess the prisoner within five to seven days. Each of these\n12 steps is deficient in ways that expose prisoners to substantial risk of serious harm.\n13 26.  Both the Intake Health Screening form and the custody officers who\n14 ~ complete it are inadequate for the task. Though the form does include some questions\n15 about prisoners' mental health, Dr. Hayward found it was insufficient to capture adequate\n16 information regarding prisoners with mental illness. As Dr. Hayward explains, the form\n17 should, but does not, include questions regarding whether the prisoner has ever been\n18 hospitalized at a psychiatric facility in the past five years, whether the prisoner ever has\n19 been or is currently depressed, or has ever had mental health counseling or treatment. See\n20 Grunfeld Decl., Ex. M,a t 2. I agree with Dr. Hayward's recommendations.\n21 27.  Dr. Puisis, in his report, concluded that the Intake Health Screening process\n22 ~ \"does not provide for accurate or appropriate medical intake screening and therefore does\n23 not protect incoming detainees from harm.\" Grunfeld Decl., Ex. J, at 15. He found that\n24 the \"responsibilities placed upon correctional officers ... are well beyond their ability to\n25 perform\" and that the officers were not properly trained for the function. Id. He\n26 recommended that, for a jail the size of Monterey County Jail, all screening be conducted\n27 by nurses. See id. I agree with Dr. Puisis. Having custody staff conduct initial health care\n28 screenings is ineffective and dangerous. Prisoners with mental illness, many of whom also\n[11407847] ~~  CV 13 2354 PSG\nDECL.

Having non-medical, poorly-trained staff conduct initial healthcare evaluations\n4 ~ places all prisoners, especially those with mental illness, at risk of harm.\n5 28.  At this first stage of the intake process, Dr. Puisis also observed that custody\n6 ~ staff members make decisions regarding whether to place prisoners in sobering or safety\n7 ~ cells. See Grunfeld Decl., Ex. J, at 19-20. Dr. Puisis found that the officers making these\n8 decisions \"are not trained to identify persons at risk for withdrawal, to evaluate persons\n9 who appear to be intoxicated, or to make medical decisions with respect to isolation for\n10 this purpose.... The altered mental status of alcoholism or drug withdrawal can mask\n11 serious injury or other medical conditions.\" Id. at 20. Dr. Puisis recommended that these\n12 decisions should be made \"by medical professionals not custody officers.\" Id. And he\n13 concluded that the current practice \"places detainees at risk for harm.\" Id.\n14 29.  I agree with Dr. Puisis. As he correctly states, substance intoxication and/or\n15 ~ withdrawal can mask serious injury or other medical conditions. These conditions also\n16 heighten the risk of suicide. It is particularly difficult to identify prisoners with mental\n17 illness in the context of substance intoxication and withdrawal. For that reason, medical\n18 and mental health screening should be conducted by properly trained medical or mental\n19 health care staff.\n20 30.  At the first step, Dr. Puisis also found that Defendants lack any policy to\n21 ~ govern the housing of prisoners with mental illness. See Grunfeld Decl., Ex. J, at 13. This\n22 systematic deficiency places all prisoners at risk by increasing the likelihood (1)t hat a\n23 prisoner with mental illness is housed in an inappropriate setting that increases the\n24 prisoner's risk of suicide or decompensation or (2) that the prisoner with mental illness is\n25 involved in a conflict with other prisoners or staff while experiencing a behavioral\n26 disturbance secondary to his or her inadequately treated mental illness.\n27 31.  The second step of the intake process, the Intake Triage Assessment, is\n28 ~ conducted by medical staff at the Jail. Dr. Puisis found that during the Intake Triage\n~~~ao~aa-~  ~ 2  CV 13 2354 PSG\nDECL. OF PABLO STEWART 1S0 PLS.'

See\n3 Grunfeld Decl., Ex. J, at 17-19. If medical staff similarly under-identifies prisoners with\n4 ~ mental illness, and therefore fail to refer them to mental health care staff, it would also\n5 ~ place prisoners at risk of harm. Dr. Hayward indicated that this does occur in the Jail. See\n6 ~ Grunfeld Decl., Ex. N, at 5 (asking Dr. Hayward if there were \"any prisoners who suffered\n7 ~ from mental illness at the time of intake but who were not identified as having mental\n8 illness\"); Grunfeld Decl., Ex. O, at 2( responding that \"some inmates were not identified as\n9 having a mental illness until sometime following their intake\").\n10 32.  In order to reach the third step of the mental illness identification process,\n11 prisoners must be referred by medical staff to see mental health care staff. According to\n12 Dr. Hayward, mental health care staff is available for urgent mental health care referrals\n13 during the week, but are not available over the weekends or on holidays. See Grunfeld\n14 Decl., Ex. M, at 2. This staffing deficiency, discussed above, places all prisoners at risk.\n15 ~ It also appears, at least with respect to the suicide of Daniel Lariviere, discussed below,\n16 that mental health evaluations do not always occur in a timely manner during the week.\n17 33.  According to Dr. Hayward, even when prisoners get to see mental health\n18 ~ care staff for an initial evaluation, clinicians do not use any standardized mental health\n19 intake form to summarize a prisoner's \"symptom and treatment history, community\n20 provider(s), prior diagnoses and medications, co-occurring disorders, substance use,[ or]\n21 history of self-harm or suicidal ideation and attempts.\" Id. at 4. As I discuss further\n22 below, mental health care staff also does not utilize any comprehensive suicide risk\n23 assessment tool to evaluate prisoners' risk of suicide. These lack of standardized practices\n24 place prisoners at risk.\n25 34.  It also appears that Defendants do not identify and continue needed mental\n26 health care treatment for prisoners who were receiving care in the community. Any\n27 disruption of psychiatric medications can be dangerous for a number of reasons. First,\n28 individuals who take prescribed medication to control their mental illness often\n[~iao~ea-~~  I  ~ 3  CV 13 2354 PSG\nDECL. OF PABLO STEWART ISO PLS.' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION\n\nCase5:14-cv-02730-BLF   Document55   Filed10/28/14   Page177 of 227\nCase7:14-cv-02730   Document1-4   Filed06/12/14   Page16 of 66\nCase5:13-cv-02354-PSG   Document51   Filed04/29/14   Page15 of 65\n1 ~ decompensate if their medication is interrupted. This can lead to increased symptoms and\n2 ~ risk of suicide. Second, a disruption of prescribed psychiatric medication can actually\n3 ~ exacerbate the underlying mental illness by altering brain physiology and causing an\n4 ~ expansion of foci in the brain of the condition at issue. This is called the \"kindling\n5 ~ phenomenon.\" Finally, because disruption of medication can cause a worsening of the\n6 underlying condition, it can also make it more difficult to treat the metal illness.\n7 35.  For all of these reasons, it is important that Defendants minimize the\n8 disruption in receipt of prescribed psychotropic medications. One of the most important\n9 means for accomplishing this task is to quickly obtain outside pharmacy records for\n10 prisoners to confirm their prescriptions and dosages. This process does not appear to\n11 function properly, especially on weekends. Dr. Hayward found that only mental health\n12 care staff members, not medical staff, initiate requests for pharmacy records for prisoners\n13 with mental illness. See id. at 4. Because of the lack of mental health care staff on site\n14 during the weekends, Defendants do not even begin the process of obtaining mental health\n15 care records for prisoners booked on Fridays and weekends until the following Monday.\n16 See id. This can result in significant disruptions in the receipt of prescribed psychotropic\n17 ~ medications, which creates the risks I describe above.\n18 36.  Dr. Puisis found that Defendants' policies and practices for continuing\n19 ~ medications begun prior to incarceration are fundamentally flawed. Troublingly, he found\n20 that \"if a detainee does not remember the name of his medication or if the health staff can\n21 not verify a prescription of medication at a local pharmacy, no medication is provided even\n22 when medication is medically necessary.\" Grunfeld Decl., Ex. J, at 23. Dr. Puisis also\n23 found that Defendants lack an adequate process for physician intervention for when staff\n24 cannot verify outside medical records. See id. at 13. He concluded that \"[b]ased on chart\n25 reviews, it appears that MCJ is systematically denying necessary medication to patients\n26 with chronic disease.\" Id. at 23. Similar failures with respect to continuing psychiatric\n27 treatment for prisoners newly-booked into the Jail would place prisoners at serious risk of\n28 harm.\n[11407847] ~ 4  CV 13 2354 PSG\nDECL.

The problems identified by Dr. Puisis are likely caused by serious\n2 ~ deficiencies and lack of clarity in the policies regarding continuation of medications\n3 ~ prescribed prior to incarceration. There appear to be two policies that might govern the\n4 provision of psychotropic medications to prisoners newly arrived at the Jail. First, CFMG\n5 policy includes a list of medications that can be continued prior to being seen by a mid-\n6 level provider or a physician in the sick call process. See Grunfeld Decl., Ex. G, at 371.\n7 Psychotropic medications are not on this list of medications. This means it is critically\n8 important that a process exist to ensure prisoners on psychotropic medications have\n9 immediate access to a prescribing provider. This is not, however, the case. CFMG has a\n10 second, more specific policy, entitled \"Psychotropic Medications,\" which sets forth the\n11 procedure for continuing psychotropic medications. See id. at 361. It states that \"[n]o\n12 psychotropic medications shall be unilaterally discontinued without consultation with the\n13 facility physician or psychiatrist.\" Id. But it then explains that no prisoner will receive\n14 psychotropic medications until staff requests their outside psychiatric records and they are\n15 seen by a psychiatrist at the Jail. The policy only requires that the prisoner be seen by the\n16 psychiatrist within 5-7 days of booking. As I read the policy, this means that, at best, even\n17 a prisoner who brings his medication to the Jail and for whom the Jail immediately verifies\n18 his prescriptions, will suffer, at a minimum, a five day interruption in medication. As I\n19 discuss above, a five day interruption of medication can cause very serious problems. This\n20 policy for continuing prescriptions for psychotropic medications begun prior to\n21 incarceration places prisoners at a substantial risk of serious harm.\n22 38 .  Defendants also appear to engage in a very dangerous detoxification process\n23 ~ for prisoners who arrive at the Jail intoxicated or with a history of drug or alcohol abuse.\n24 Individuals suffering alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal are at increased risk of\n25 seizures. Most antipsychotic medications lower the seizure threshold. Consequently, it is\n26 ~ clinically appropriate to remove a person experiencing alcohol or benzodiazepine\n27 withdrawal from antipsychotic medications they are taking for up to 72 to 96 hours for\n28 alcohol withdrawal and up to a week depending on the type of benzodiazepine. After that\n[~iao~ea-~~  I  15  CV 13 2354 PSG\nDECL. OF PABLO STEWART ISO PLS.'

As far as I am\n2 aware, alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal present the only circumstances where, as\n3 part of a detoxification process, it is clinically appropriate to temporarily remove a prisoner\n4 ~ from antipsychotic medications. There is no medical reason to remove people from\n5 I~ psychotropic medications as part of the detoxification process from opiates or\n6',~ psychostimulants.\n7 39.  From my limited review, however, it appears that Defendants utilize a\n8 ~ punitive, medically contraindicated detoxification process for some prisoners that involves\n9 removing them from all psychotropic medications for 90 days or longer. For example, my\n10 review of the declaration for Plaintiff Gist shows that she was booked into the Jail on\n11 March 15, 2012. She informed medical and custody staff that she was taking a number of\n12 psychotropic medications, including Risperidone, Fluoxetine, Benztropine, and Trazodone.\n13 Four days later, on March 19, 2012, her relatives brought those psychotropic medications\n14 to the Jail for her. That same day, the Jail obtained pharmacy records that confirmed that\n15 she was prescribed the same medications. On March 20, 2012, a psychologist at the Jail\n16 consulted with Dr. Fithian about whether Plaintiff Gist should be provided with her\n17 prescription medication. Dr. Fithian instructed that \"due to history of alcoholism, ... we\n18 should hold off medicating her for now to allow her to detox from alcohol while in\n19 custody.\" On March 27, Plaintiff Gist was again seen by the psychologist. In a progress\n20 note, the psychologist wrote that \"[p]rior to seeing inmate, writer conferred with\n21 Dr. Fithian. It was agreed that she is to remain medication free and clean and sober for 90\n22 ~ days.\" It appears that mental health care staff at the Jail also refused to provide Plaintiff\n23 Greim with psychiatric medications for 90 days on the basis that he suffered from alcohol\n24 dependence.\n25 40.  There was no clinical justification for denying Plaintiffs Gist and Greim\n26 ~ psychotropic medications for 90 days because of a history of alcohol abuse. In fact, such a\n27 process is medically contraindicated for the reasons I described above regarding the risks\n28 of interrupting psychotropic medications.

Plaintiff Gist's experience also included examples of other problems with the\n3 ~ intake process. Defendants did not even consider continuing her previously prescribed\n4 ~ medications for at least five days after booking. As I discuss above, afive-day delay to\n5 ~ determine whether to continue prescribed medications does not meet the standard of care.\n6 ~ In addition, Plaintiff Gist did not receive aface-to-face evaluation from Dr. Fithian, the\n7 ~ only mental health care staff with prescribing authority at the Jail, prior to discontinuing\n8 Plaintiff Gist's psychotropic medications. The standard of care for starting or stopping\n9 medication is for the prescriber to conduct aface-to-face evaluation.\n10 42.  As evidenced by the circumstances surrounding the suicide of Daniel\n11 ~ Lariviere, which occurred in July 2011, problems with the intake process can have fatal\n12 consequences. I discuss additional problems with Mr. Lariviere's suicide below, but his\n13 tragic experience with the intake process is revealing. In short, Mr. Lariviere committed\n14 suicide approximately 72 hours after he arrived at the Jail. Upon his arrest, which took\n15 place on a Tuesday, Mr. Lariviere was placed in a safety cell in restraints without any prior\n16 consultation with mental health care staff. He remained in the safety cell for\n17 approximately 2.5 hours, and was released without approval from any mental health care\n18 staff. About 12 hours later, Mr. Lariviere was finally interviewed by custody staff for the\n19 Intake Health Screening assessment. Mr. Lariviere informed custody staff that he was\n20 under the care of a doctor for psychiatric reasons, had a history of alcohol abuse, and had\n21 recently been discharged from a psychiatric hospital. Despite this information, custody\n22 staff recommended that he be placed in the general population. Mr. Lariviere was then\n23 evaluated by medical staff, who confirmed the information Mr. Lariviere provided to\n24 custody staff and learned that Mr. Lariviere was having auditory hallucinations and had\n25 been discharged from the psychiatric hospital only four days earlier. The medical staff\n26 conducting the Intake Triage Assessment set a medical appointment for Mr. Lariviere the\n27 next day, but did not request an urgent psychiatric consultation, and instead, made an\n28 appointment with mental health staff for Friday, three days later.

For reasons unclear, Mr. Lariviere was\n3 then single-celled in an administrative segregation housing unit in a cell that contained\n4 ~ suicide hazards.

When Mr. Lariviere committed suicide early on Friday morning, he had\n7 ~ received no psychiatric medications and had not been evaluated by either mental health or\n8 medical staff.

If any one of a number of things that should have happened did\n10 take placeโmental health care consultations before and upon release from placement in\n11 safety cell, a mental health suicide risk evaluation prior to being placed in housing, a\n12 timely request for and review of outside medical treatment and prescription medication\n13 records, the continuation of previously prescribed medications, and a safe housing\n14 placement for a seriously mentally ill and suicidal prisonerโhis suicide would have been\n15 prevented.\n16 43.  The intake process is more difficult to conduct adequately in overcrowded,\n17 ~ understaffed facilities, like the Jail, than in jails that have adequate staff and are not\n18 overcrowded.\n19 44.

In\n2 ~ my experience, many prisoners with mental illness will underreport their mental health\n3 ~ conditions during the intake process. As a result, it is critical to have a means for them to\n4 ~ confidentially communicate their mental health needs at a later time. This system is also\n5 ~ vital in suicide prevention in that prisoners will often use the system to seek help for\n6 ~ suicidality.\n7 46.  Health requests should be collected and triaged at least twice in any 24 hours\n8 ~ period. The system must also have in place mechanisms for the most acute patients to be\n9 seen immediately by appropriate staff after the request is triaged.\n10 47.  The current health care request process at the Jail does not provide prisoners\n11 with a reliable and effective means for requesting mental health care services and being\n12 timely seen and assessed. Pursuant to policy, the primary method prisoners have for\n13 requesting either medical or mental health care services is to fill out and submit what is\n14 called a \"sick call slip.\" See Grunfeld Decl., Ex. G, at 230. According to Dr. Puisis, there\n15 are a variety of problems with the current policy and practices for triaging sick slips. The\n16 policy itself is very brief: It does not address how nurses are to evaluate health requests; it\n17 does not include a timeframe for evaluating sick call slips; it does not require vital signs\n18 for all symptomatic complains; and it does not require that sick call slips and/or the\n19 response to sick call slips be tracked. See Grunfeld Decl., Ex. J, at 11, 22.\n20 48.  Two additional problems identified by Dr. Puisis are particularly relevant to\n21 the delivery of mental health care. First, even though there are as many as 200 prisoners\n22 housed in segregation at any time, including two male( A and B)a nd two female( R and S)\n23 pods of prisoners with serious mental illness, there is no policy for how such prisoners are\n24 to obtain and submit sick call slips. See id. at 22. Second, though all sick call slips are\n25 evaluated by medical nurses, there is no policy regarding what is to be done with requests\n26 that raise psychiatric issues. See id. at 11. I have reviewed the policy and agree with\n27 Dr. Puisis' conclusions.\n28 49.  The sick call process appears to be even more dysfunctional in practice.\n~~iao~aยข~  II  lq  CV 13 2354 PSG\nDECL.

Moreover, according to Dr. Puisis,\n3 ~ Defendants do not track \"how many people place requests, how many are seen, or whether\n4 ~ their care was timely,\" and thus are \"unable to evaluate [their] own performance with\n5 ~ respect to detainee access to care.\" Id. Dr. Hayward reached a similar conclusion. See\n6 Grunfeld Decl., Ex.

I have reviewed the declarations of all of the named plaintiffs in this action.\n9 ~ Most of these declarations describe serious problems using the sick call process to access\n10 appropriate care.\n11 51.  In addition, Defendants do not provide a confidential place for prisoners to\n12 ~ submit sick call slips. Instead, as found by both Dr. Puisis and Dr. Hayward, prisoners\n13 submit sick call slips in the same boxes into which prisoners also submit grievances\n14 regarding non-medical issues. Only custody officers have keys to access the boxes and\n15 collect the sick slips and grievances. As Dr. Hayward wrote, \"[t]his practice requires\n16 modification since current correctional healthcare standards require that inmates have\n17 privacy of their healthcare requests.\" Id. at 3; see also Grunfeld Decl., Ex.

Many psychotropic medications can cause\n2~~ significant and adverse side effects, including, but not limited to, extrapyramidal and\n3 'I~ metabolic syndromes and cardiac complications, which can cause unnecessary pain and be\n4 life threatening. As a result, medical and custody staff in the Jail play a very important\n5 'I ~ role monitoring drug side effects, efficacy, and compliance. Staff administering\n6 I~ medication must record their clinical impression of prisoners taking psychotropic\n7 medication, any reports of side effects, and any instances ofnon-compliance. It appears\n8 that Defendants do not adequately utilize the medication administration process to monitor\n9 prisoners on psychotropic medications. Dr. Puisis found that \"[m]edication administration\n10 records are not used to record administration of medication at the time medication is\n11 administered. Instead, ... [recording medication administration is performed at a later\n12 time by virtue of evaluating the envelopes [in which the medications were packaged for\n13 prisoners] after return to the medication room which may be a few hours after starting\n14 medication administration. The nurse records an empty envelope as a successful\n15 medication administration. Envelopes which still contain medication are recorded as not\n16 given.

Medication administration should be documented at the time it\n18 is performed.\" Grunfeld Decl., Ex. J at 24-25. I agree with Dr. Puisis. The process\n19 currently in place for documenting medication distribution places prisoners at risk because\n20 it is not adequate for monitoring the side effects, efficacy, and compliance for prisoners\n21 taking psychotropic medications.\n22 54.  In addition, a number of the plaintiffs' declarations indicate significant\n23 ~ problems renewing expiring prescriptions for medication. From these declarations, it\n24 appears that rather than scheduling prisoners for medical appointments prior to the\n25 expiration of a prescription, Jail staff, before taking any action, waits for prisoners to file\n26 sick call slips for renewal. For many of the plaintiffs, this frequently resulted in\n27 disruptions in medications. As I discussed above, any disruption in the receipt of\n2811 psychotropic medications can cause serious harm to prisoners.\n~~~ao~ea-~]  ~~  21  CV 13 2354 PSG'\nDECL. OF PABLO STEWART ISO PLS.'

Mental health therapy is an essential component of any mental health care\n4 ~ system. As important as it is to have an adequate psychiatric medication system, mental\n5 ~ illness requires additional treatments besides medication.\n6 56.  Defendants offer very few opportunities for prisoners to receive mental\n7 ~ health therapies. It appears from Dr. Hayward's draft report that the only therapy available\n8 to prisoners is individual supportive counseling and psychotherapy offered by the L.M.F.T.\n9 and group socialization/support groups run by the psychiatric nurse. Dr. Hayward does not\n10 specify how many hours of therapy the L.M.F.T. offers on weekly basis. He does indicate\n11 that prisoners who are cleared by custody staff are eligible to receive one hour of group\n12 therapy every two weeks.\n13 57.  As I discussed above, the quantity of group therapy offered at the Jailโonce\n14 every other week for one hourโfalls well below the standard of care for seriously\n15 mentally ill prisoners housed in restricted housing units. Individual therapy should be\n16 provided as often as clinically indicated. Because I do not know how often individual\n17 therapy is offered, I cannot draw any opinion regarding its adequacy for all mentally ill\n18 prisoners.\n19 58.  Pursuant to Defendants' policies and according to Dr. Hayward, it appears\n20 ~ that the prisoners with the most severe mental illness may be denied access to group\n21 therapy. Dr. Hayward explained in his draft report that only prisoners who \"are\n22 sufficiently stable to participate in group\" therapy are permitted to participate. Grunfeld\n23 Decl., Ex. M, at 6. Plaintiffs' counsel requested clarification from Dr. Hayward regarding\n24 ~ who determines whether a prisoner is \"sufficiently stable.\" Dr. Hayward explained that\n25 \"deputies have the responsibility to determine which inmate-patients can participate safely\n26 in groups. The deputies consider only safety issues not clinical issues.\" Grunfeld Decl.,\n27 ~ Ex. O, at 5.

Moreover, custody staff, not clinical staff, makes the decisions\n3 regarding who can participate in socialization groups. This is very problematic. Custody\n4 staff members lack clinical training to determine what treatment a prisoner with serious\n5 mental illness requires. As far as I could determine from my review of the Jail and CFMG\n6 policies, there is no policy governing which prisoners custody staff should permit to\n7 participate in group therapy. Though I have not had an opportunity to observe group\n8 ~ therapy offered at the Jail, I have serious concerns that the most seriously ill and difficult\n9 prisoners will be denied access to therapy.\n10 59.  It is considerably more difficult to offer adequate mental health therapy to\n11 ~ prisoners in overcrowded facilities. In order to offer individual and group therapy, the\n12 facility must have sufficient staff to transport prisoners to and from the location of the\n13 therapy and confidential and adequately-sized locations that are conducive to therapy. In\n14 overcrowded facilities, like the Jail, both adequate transportation staff and adequate space\n15 to offer therapy are frequently lacking. It appears that both areas are problems at the Jail.\n16 Defendants Lack Adequate Policies and Practices for Transferring Prisoners Who\nRequire Higher Levels of'Psychiatric Care to Facilities Licensed to Provide That\n17 Level of Care.\n18 60.  Another critical element of any adequate correctional mental health system is\n19 the ability to provide inpatient mental health care services to prisoners who require higher\n20 levels of care. Prisoners must have access to inpatient units with appropriately trained\n21 ~ mental health care staff. Prisoners must also have access to units licensed to provide care\n22 ~ to prisoners in acute psychiatric crisis.\n23 61.  From my review, the Jail is not licensed to provide any higher levels of care\n24 ~ to prisoners with serious mental illness. Accordingly, Defendants must have in place\n25 adequate policies and practices for transferring prisoners to a licensed facility that can\n26 provide such care. I have not fully evaluated the processes in place at the Jail, but it\n27 appears that, in theory, Defendants utilize a mental health care unit at Natividad Medical\n28 Center( \"NMC\") when prisoners require higher levels of care. According to Dr. Hayward,\n[11407847]  I  V 13 2354 PSG\nDECL.

Dr. Hayward writes\n2 that:\n3 The [Jail] has the capability of transporting an inmate to Natividad Medical\nCenter for acute psychiatric services on weekends. However, review of the\n4 records indicates that this rarely occurs and most inmate-patients remain in\nthe jail until the mental health clinicians arrive on Monday. They may be\n5 placed in a safety cell on suicide precautions for observation until they can\nbe evaluated by a mental health clinician. The safety cells are used\n6 excessively for this purpose and inmates may remain in the safety cell over\nthe weekend until a clinician provides evaluation and release on Mondays.\n7\n8 Grunfeld Decl., Ex. M at 5. I agree with Dr. Hayward that Defendants' failures to timely\n9 transfer prisoners to inpatient mental health care units when necessary is a significant\n10 ~ problem and places prisoners with mental illness at risk of serious harm.\n11 By Housing Prisoners With Serious Mental Illness in Administrative Segregation,\nDefendants Place Prisoners' Mental Health In Serious Jeopardy.\n12\n13 62.  As discussed above, Defendants have a policy of housing the prisoners with\n14 ~ the most serious mental illness in administrative segregation unitsโ A and B Pods for\n15 men, R and S Pods for women. See Grunfeld Decl., Ex. M, at 6.1 According to policy,\n16 ~ prisoners in these units are locked in their cells for 23 hours per day. Grunfeld Dec.,\n17 ~ Ex. G, at 217. This policy is confirmed by named Plaintiffs who have been housed in\n18 administrative segregation in the Jail, who describe how they and other prisoners in such\n19 pods are only permitted one hour outside of their cells per day. The hour that prisoners are\n20 permitted outside of their cell is the only opportunity they have to exercise, shower, and\n21 use the telephone.\n22 63.  Prisoners with mental illness are likely to deteriorate and decompensate in\n23 segregation units under isolated conditions. This deterioration and decompensation often\n24 takes the form of acting out and other actions that may violate the rules of the correctional\n25\n26 i C, D, G, H,I , and J-Pods also are administrative segregations units. It is my\nunderstanding that Defendants house prisoners with mental illness in these units as well.\n27 However, according to Dr. Hayward, A, B, R, and S-Pods are the only administrative\nsegregation units in which Defendants house prisoners because oft heir mental illness.\n28\n[11407847) CV 13 2354 PSG\nDECL.

In these cases, the prisoners' \"bad\" conduct is the direct product of their mental\n2 illness. Their illness exacerbates the psychological and behavioral reactions they have to\n3 the pain and stress of isolated confinement.\nD 64.  Scientific literature establishes the risk of harm posed to seriously mentally\nill persons who are placed in solitary confinement or segregation. The recognition of this\n6 ~ risk has led professional mental health organizations to prohibit the placement of the\n7 ~ seriously mentally ill in such units or, if it is absolutely necessary (and only as a last resort)\n8 to confine them there, but under strict limits and with significant amounts of out-of-cell\n9 time and enhanced access to care. For example, the American Psychiatric Association\n10 i(~~  \"APA\") has issued a Position Statement on Segregation of Prisoners with Mental lllness\n11 stating:\n12 Prolonged segregation of adult inmates with serious mental illness, with rare\nexceptions, should be avoided due to the potential for harm to such inmates.\n13 If an inmate with serious mental illness is placed in segregation, out-of-cell\nstructured therapeutic activities (i.e., mental health/psychiatric treatment) in\n14 appropriate programming space and adequate unstructured out-of-cell time\nshould be permined.  Correctional mental health authorities should work\n15 closely with administrative custody staff to maximize access to clinically\nindicated programming and recreation for the individuals.\n16\n17 ~ The APA's position on this issue reflects the accepted fact that mentally ill prisoners are\n18 ~ especially vulnerable to isolation- and stress-related regression, deterioration, and\n19 ~ decompensating that worsen their psychiatric conditions and intensify their mental health-\n20 ~ related symptoms and maladies (including depression, psychosis, and self-harm). I share\n21 this view.\n22 65.  Correctional professionals likewise have recognized the risk of placing\n23 mentally ill prisoners in isolated confinement.

Moreover, they are charged with regularly\n2 ~ monitoring isolated prisoners to identify any who may be manifesting the signs and\n3 ~ symptoms of emerging mental illness and to remove them from these harmful\n4 environments if indicated.\n5 66.  The concerns about placing prisoners with serious mental illness in isolated\n6 ~ conditions generally emanate from the conundrum faced by correctional staff when a\n7 ~ prisoner with serious mental illness violates the rules of a facility. Standard correctional\n8 practice is to place prisoners who break facility rules in the isolated conditions of\n9 administrative segregation as a punishment. A consensus has been reached in mental\n10 health care and correctional communities, however, that when a prisoner who breaks the\n11 rules suffers from serious mental illness, the facility must take into account the prisoner's\n12 mental illness when devising an appropriate response to his or her rule breaking. This\n13 break from ordinary practice is necessitated by the risks that a prisoner with mental illness\n14 faces in administrative segregation.\n15 67.  Defendants' use of administrative segregation as a place to house prisoners\n16 ~ with mental illness who have not violated any Jail rules is an extremely dangerous\n17 practice. Instead of trying to avoid placing prisoners with serious mental illness in\n18 administrative segregation unless absolutely necessary, Defendants place such prisoners in\n19 administrative segregation because oft heir serious mental illness. Thus, as a matter of\n20 policy and practice, Defendants intentionally expose prisoners with serious mental illness\n21 to the dangerous conditions of administrative segregation. This practice is far outside the\n22 accepted norms in the correctional or mental health care communities, and places prisoners\n23 at risk of grave harm.\n24 68.  Not only do Defendants place prisoners in administrative segregation\n25 ~ because of their mental illness, Defendants have no policy governing how and when\n26 prisoners placed in administrative segregation should be transferred to less restrictive\n27 housing environments. Dr. Hayward recommended in his draft report that \"the Sheriff\n28 adopt a policy of having Classification review the status of mentally ill inmates housed in\n[11407847]  II  26  CV 13 2354 PSG\nDECL.

M, at 9. I infer from Dr. Hayward's\n3 ~ recommendation that such reviews do not occur monthly and may not occur at all. Failing\n4 ~ to reevaluate prisoners with serious mental illness to transfer them out of administrative\n5 ~ segregation as soon as possible further contributes to the risks of harm faced by such\n6 ~ prisoners.\n7 69.  Approximately half of all suicides committed in correctional facilities take\n8 ~ place in administrative segregation units. In fact, all three suicides since 2010 in the Jail\n9 have occurred in administrative segregation. One of the suicides occurred in A Pod, one of\n10 the housing units in which Defendants specifically place prisoners with serious,\n11 unstabilized mental illness.\n12 70.  In recognition of the risks posed to prisoners with mental illness in\n13 ~ administrative segregation, it is the correctional standard that security checks occur twice\n14 every hour at intervals no longer than 30 minutes at unpredictable and intermittent times.\n15 Pursuant to policy, custody staff only conducts health and welfare checks of prisoners in\n16 administrative segregation once every hour. The policy also does not mandate that the\n17 security checks be conducted at intermittent and unpredictable times or that staff log their\n18 observations of prisoners. See Grunfeld Decl., Ex. E, at ยง 1106.04. It is my opinion that\n19 the inadequacies in the Defendants' policies for conducting safety checks on prisoners in\n20 administrative segregation place all prisoners, especially those with serious mental illness,\n21 at risk of serious harm.\n22 71.  It is my opinion that Defendants overuse administrative segregation units to\n23 house prisoners with mental illness. Overuse of administrative segregation is a common\n24 problem in overcrowded facilities like the Jail.\n25 Defendants' Suicide Prevention Program Is Deficient in a Number of Respects that\nSignificantly Increase the Likelihood of Self-Harm and Suicide For All Prisoners,\n26 Especially Those With Mental Illness.\n27 72.

Assuming the\n4 Jail maintained an average daily population of 1000 prisoners throughout that time period,\n5 ~ the suicide rate for the Jail for those four years is 75 suicides per 100,000 prisoners. That\n6 rate is 74 percent above the national average for jail populations.\n7 73.  Having reviewed the Jail's suicide prevention policies, a number of\n8 ~ documents related to completed and attempted suicides, and the declarations for the named\n9 Plaintiffs, it is not surprising that the rate of suicide in the Jail is above the national\n10 average.

Prisoners newly booked into the Jail have a\n15 higher risk of suicide than prisoners who have been in the Jail for a longer time.\n16 Incarceration is one of the most stressful experiences people can encounter. The stress\n17 associated with arrest incarceration increases the likelihood of suicide. People often are\n18 booked into the Jail while intoxicated on drugs and alcohol; individuals experiencing acute\n19 withdrawal are at an extremely high risk for suicide. Finally, the mentally ill are\n20 overrepresented in the Jail population. As a result, Defendants' failures of suicide\n21 prevention during the intake process place prisoners at great risk of harm.\n22 75.  According to Dr. Hayward, Defendants do not utilize any comprehensive\n23 ~ ~ suicide risk assessment tool. See Grunfeld Decl., Ex. M, at 12. The only means by which\n24 Defendants become aware of prisoners who are at risk of suicide is when prisoners express\n25 suicidal ideation to staff or display self-harm behavior. See id. Dr. Hayward, as an\n26\n3 See U.S. Dept of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Mortality in Local Jails and State\n27 Prisons, 2000-2011, at 8, Table 3( Aug. 2013), available at\nhttp://www.bjs .g ov/content/pub/pdf/mljs p0011.pdf.\n28\n[11407847]  II  28  CV 13 2354 PSG\nDECL.

See id. at Appendix A.\n2 Without a suicide assessment tool, Defendants are unable to employ suicide prevention\n3 efforts with respect to a subpopulation of prisoners at high risk of suicideโthose who have\n4 any of a variety of indicia of suicidality, but who have not yet engaged in self-harm or\n5 reported their suicidal feelings to any staff members. A suicide risk assessment tool is a\nbasic element of an adequate suicide prevention program.\n7 76.  When Jail staff members determine that a prisoner is at risk of harming him\n8 or herself, staff members place prisoners in one of the six safety cells in the Jail. The\n9 conditions in the safety cells are extraordinarily punitive. According to Plaintiffs'\n10 declarations, the safety cells, which are often referred to as \"rubber rooms,\" are empty\n11 rooms with padded walls and floors. The safety cells have no features other than a\n12 window and a tray slot in the door and a grate in the floor through which prisoners must\n13 urinate and defecate. The safety cells have no beds, sinks, toilets (other than the grate in\n14 the floor), chairs, tables, or windows for natural light. Prisoners must sit, sleep, and eat on\n15 the same floor on which the toilet grate is located. In addition, according to Dr. Hayward,\n16 the safety cells are not sufficiently maintained and cleaned. See id. at 11. As a result, they\n17 frequently smell of and are sometimes covered in feces.\n18 77.  Prisoners placed in the safety cells are denied nearly all privileges and\n19 ~ human contact. From my review of safety cell logs attached to Plaintiffs' declarations,\n20 prisoners are not provided with showers, any out of cell time, exercise, or property while in\n21 the safety cells, regardless of how long they are retained in those cells. Pursuant to policy,\n22 Defendants are supposed to provide prisoners with meals and water; from my review of\n23 Plaintiffs' declarations, it appears that this does not always happen. In addition, Jail policy\n24 explicitly permits staff to handcuff and shackle prisoners while they are in the safety cells.\n25 See Grunfeld Decl., Ex. E, at ยง 1104.06 (section improperly numbered in e~chibit as\n26 11104.06). From my review of some of the Plaintiffs' declarations, it appears that staff\n27 frequently engages in this practice.\n28 78.  As if the conditions discussed above were not sufficiently punitive,\n~~~ao~aยข~  29  CV 13 2354 PSG\nDECL. OF PABLO STEWART ISO PLS.'

Jail policy\n2 ~ requires that prisoners placed in the safety cells \"shall be allowed to retain sufficient\n3 ~ clothing or be provided with a safety smock to provide for their personal privacy unless\n4 ~ specific identified risks to the inmate's safety or to the security of the facility are\n5 ~ documented.\" Id. at ยง 1104.05(I)( section improperly numbered in ea~hibit as 1114.05).\n6 ~ However, according to Dr. Hayward, Jail staff frequently deprives prisoners of clothing or\n7 a safety smock gown for many hours. See Grunfeld Decl., Ex. M, at 11.\n8 79.  It is my opinion that these conditions are overly restrictive and punitive.\n9 Confining a suicidal prisoner to their cell for 24 hours a day only enhances isolation and is\n10 anti-therapeutic. Under these circumstances, it is also difficult, if not impossible, to\n11 accurately gauge the source of the prisoner's suicidal ideation. The punitive nature of the\n12 safety cells also increases the risk of suicide in two very dangerous ways. First, the\n13 conditions increase prisoners' suicidality, also increasing the risk that prisoners will follow\n14 through on their suicidal feelings. Second, punitive conditions in the safety cells increase\n15 the likelihood that a suicidal individual will not report feelings of suicidality in order to\n16 avoid being placed in a safety cell.\n17 80.  These effects are very real, not hypothetical. For example, according to his\n18 ~ declaration, when Plaintiff Mefford was experiencing suicidal thoughts in January 2014,\n19 he explicitly represented to mental health care staff that he was unsure whether he should\n20 report his true level of suicidality because he was afraid he would be placed in a safety\n21 cell. Once he was placed in the safety cell, his suicidality increased markedly and he\n22 engaged in repeated acts of self-harm.\n23 81.  Defendants' policies and practices for observing prisoners in safety cells are\n24 wholly inadequate and place prisoners at risk. Sheriff's Office policy requires that custody\n25 staff members conduct and log a safety check at least twice every thirty minutes when a\n26 prisoner is in a safety cell. See Grunfeld Decl., Ex. E, at ยง 1104.05(B)&  ( C)( section\n27 improperly numbered in exhibit as 1114.05). CFMG policy requires that medical staff be\n28 notified within one hour of a prisoner's placement in a safety cell, that medical staff\n~t~ao~sa-~  II  3~  CV 13 2354 PSG\nDECL.

Grunfeld Decl., Ex. G, at 289.\n3 82.  The policies, even if followed perfectly, are problematic in a number of ways\n4 ~ that place prisoners at risk. First, Defendants lack any policy for suicide watch. Suicide\n5 watchโwhere staff constantly observes an acutely suicidal prisonerโis necessary to\n6 ensure that certain, acutely suicidal prisoners do not engage in self-harm. To address this\n7 danger, some correctional systems, for example the Federal Bureau of Prisons, place all\n8 suicidal prisoners under constant observation until such time that mental health care staff\n9 determines the prisoner is no longer at risk of self-harm. The complete lack of a suicide\n10 watch policy at the Jail places prisoners at risk of serious harm.\n11 83.  Second, the custody policy for conducting safety checks of suicidal prisoners\n12 ~ placed in safety cells does not require that the twice-every-half-hour safety checks be\n13 conducted at unpredictable and non-repeating times. Safety checks at unpredictable times\n14 are necessary to ensure that the patient cannot anticipate the amount of time they will not\n15 be observed and engage in suicidal acts.\n16 84.  Third, CFMG's policy permits a suicidal prisoner to be kept in a safety cell\n17 ~ for up to 24 hours without any evaluation by mental health care staff. A suicidal patient\n18 should be seen prior to being placed in a safety cell to determine if they require such\n19 placement. In cases where that is not possible, the patient should be seen as soon as\n20 possible after placement in a safety cell; 24 hours is far too long for a suicidal prisoner to\n21 spend in a safety cell without being seen by mental health care staff. The lack of an\n22 adequate policy has, according to Dr. Hayward, resulted an \"excessive\" use of safety cells\n23 at the Jail. Grunfeld Decl., Ex. M, at 12. Dr. Hayward wrote that \"[r]eview of the records\n24 ~ indicates that many of the inmates placed on suicide watch in a safety cell reported suicidal\n25 ideation but were not acutely suicidal.\" Id.\n26 85.  Fourth, the policy does not specify what level provider is authorized to\n27 ~ evaluate and remove a suicidal prisoner from a safety cell, nor does it specify whether\n28 evaluations must be in in-person. By potentially permitting low-level providers to admit,\n[11407847] 3 j  CV 13 2354 PSG\nDECL. OF PABLO STEWART ISO PLS.'

Dr. Hayward found that Defendants do not even follow their flawed safety\n4 cell policies. In his review of safety cell logs, he found \"that many deputy checks were out\n5 of compliance with the required frequency of two every 30 minutes. Some logs document\n6 delays of an hour or more between checks.\" Id. at 12. My review of the declaration for\n7 Plaintiff Mefford confirms Dr. Hayward's findings, as there were numerous times where\n8 Plaintiff Mefford was in a safety cell and was not observed by staff twice every half hour.\n9 87.  Dr. Hayward concluded that staff's failures to perform safety checks\n10 \"presents an increased risk of inmate self-harm ....\" Id. I agree with his conclusion. The\n11 failure to conduct safety checks on a timely basis is a hallmark of overcrowded facilities\n12 like the Jail.\n13 88.  Dr. Hayward also found that Defendants overuse the safety cells as holding\n14 ~ cells for prisoners displaying acute mental illness while staff waits for a mental health\n15 clinician to arrive. As he explains, prisoners \"may be placed in a safety cell on suicide\n16 precautions for observation until they can be evaluated by a mental health clinician....\n17 [I]nmates may remain in the safety cell over the weekend until a clinician provides\n18 evaluation and release on Mondays.\" Grunfeld Decl., Ex. M,a t 5. Keeping prisoners in a\n19 safety cell for a prolonged period of time, such as an entire weekend, without any attention\n20 from mental health clinicians, can seriously harm a prisoner's mental health.\n21 89.  Defendants' use of restraint chairs also places prisoners at risk of serious\n22 harm. Restraint chairs should only be used when a prisoner is so out of control that the\n23 only means for preventing harm to self or others is to place them in a restraint chair. That\n24 said, prisoners placed in restraint chairs are at significant risk of physical harm from being\n25 restrained. As a result, prisoners who have been placed in a restraint chair must be\n26 ~ constantly observed. Jail policy provides that prisoners in restraint chairs must be\n27 observed twice every thirty minutes, the same frequency as for prisoners in safety cells.\n28 90.

For example,\n2 ~ Plaintiff Mefford was placed in restraint chairs for approximately four hours and twenty\n3 ~ minutes on December 15 and 16, 2013. Staff should have conducted a minimum of 18\n4 ~ checks during that time period. Instead, staff only conducted 13 checks. Moreover, during\n5 ~ the time he was in the chair, periods of 39 and 50 minutes passed without any checks.\n6 ~ During such long periods without observation, it was possible that Plaintiff Mefford could\n7 have suffered grave injury or even death.\n8 9L   It also appears that the physical structure of the Jail does adequately protect\n9 prisoners with mental illness from suicide. TRG Consulting found in its December 2011\n10 assessment of the Jail that \"suicide hazard elimination is not as stringent as it should be to\n11 prevent self-harm ....\" Second Am. Compl., Ex. B (Dkt. No. 41), at A.3. I have not yet\n12 been able to inspect the facilities at the Jail. Nonetheless, a correctional facility should\n13 have a sufficient number of cells without suicide hazards in booking and in all places\n14 where mentally ill prisoners are housed. If Defendants have not sufficiently eliminated\n15 suicide hazards at the Jail, it would increase the risk of harm to which prisoners with\n16 mental illness are exposed.\n17 92.  I have reviewed some4 documents related to the three completed suicides\n18 ~ since 2010. In each case, problems with the Jail's mental health and suicide prevention\n19 ~ programs appear to have contributed to the suicides.\n20 93.  Daniel Lariviere: Daniel Lariviere committed suicide on July 8, 2011.\n21 Multiple failures in Defendants' mental health and suicide prevention programs preceded\n22 Mr. Lariviere's suicide. The problems with Mr. Lariviere's intake, diagnosis, and\n23 ~ intervention, discussed above in Paragraph 42, speak to deficiencies in Defendants' suicide\n24 prevention program. Defendants' actions in the hours immediately preceding and\n25 following Mr. Lariviere's death reflect additional inadequacies that place prisoners at risk.\n26\n27 4 I should note that I have only been able to review the medical file for Jessie Crow, and\nnot for the other two prisoners who committed suicide.\n28\n~i~ao~ea-~  II  ~~  CV 13 2354 PSG\nDECL.

Early in the morning, sometime between 2:05 and 3:06 a.m., Mr. Lariviere\n3 ~ tied a ligature onto part of the window and hanged himself He was found with either a t-\n4 ~ shirt or a sheet around his neck (Defendants' records are unclear) at 3:06 a.m. during an\n5 ~ hourly safety check.

Medical staff was called, and,\n7 ~ when Mr. Lariviere did not respond, he was pronounced dead.\n8 94.  Defendants' supervision of Mr. Lariviere and response to his suicide were\n9 problematic in a number of respects. The safety checks in administrative segregation were\n10 conducted hourly, as opposed to every half hour. Moreover, the checks were not staggered\n11 and unpredictable, but rather, occurred almost exactly one hour apart (at 12:10, 1:10, 2:05,\n12 and 3:06 a.m.). Though Defendants maintained a log of the time at which they conducted\n13 safety checks for Mr. Lariviere's unit (and presumably other units), they kept no log of\n14 their observations of individual prisoners (i.e., whether the prisoner was awake or asleep,\n15 standing or lying down, etc.). And rather, than start CPR immediately, the deputy shook\n16 Mr. Lariviere, and only when he did not respond, did staff begin CPR. This series of\n17 events highlight Defendants' inadequate policies and practices for monitoring prisoners in\n18 administrative segregation, inadequate training of officers regarding how to respond to\n19 medical and suicide emergencies, and lack of suicide-safe housing. Better policies,\n20 practices, and training and safer housing may have been able to save Mr. Lariviere's life.\n21 95.  Jesse CYOw: Jesse Crow committed suicide on August 7, 2011, by hanging\n22 ~ in his cell in D-Pod, one of the administrative segregation pods. According to the\n23 Coroner's Report, Mr. Crow used a rope that he manufactured himself while in Jail that he\n24 threaded through the air vent in the ceiling. He also used another rope he made in the Jail\n25 to tie his cell door closed so securely that it took two deputies to pry open the door. A\n26 number of elements of Mr. Crow's suicide are problematic. First, that Mr. Crow was able\n27 to construct two substantial ropes, and position one of them to hang himself and the other\n28 to prevent staff from opening his door, all without staff noticing indicates that staff was not\n[11407847) 34  CV 13 2354 PSG\nDECL.

In addition,\n2 ~ Mr. Crow's ability to access the air vent in his cell demonstrates that Defendants did not\n3 ~ adequately eliminate suicide hazards in administrative segregation; suicide resistant air\n4 ~ vents are generally available for jails and prisons. Finally, Mr. Crow submitted one sick\n5 ~ call slip on June 22, 2010 stating that he was depressed, and another on June 23, 2010\n6 ~ complaining of trouble sleeping. Mr. Crow was not seen by any mental health care staff\n7 ~ between his complaints and the date of his suicide.\n8 96.  Joshua Claypole: Joshua Claypole attempted suicide on May 4, 2013 by\n9 ~ hanging, and died a few days later at a hospital in San Jose from complications from his\n10 suicide attempt. As with the other two suicides, elements of Mr. Claypole's suicide\n11 demonstrate problems with the Jail's suicide prevention program. At the time he\n12 attempted suicide, Mr. Claypole was housed in A Pod, one of the administrative\n13 segregation housing units utilized by Defendants to house prisoners with serious mental\n14 illness. Mr. Claypole was found in his second-tier cell and had used his sheet as a noose.\n15 The cell included a set of sturdy metal braces on that wall to which the sheet had been tied,\n16 which are serious suicide hazards. When an officer initially found Mr. Claypole, rather\n17 than immediately open the cell to cut down the ligature, the officer requested back up by\n18 custody and medical staff. Staff did not open the cell and begin to assist Mr. Claypole\n19 until other custody staff arrived on the scene. Staff cut Mr. Claypole's ligature using a\n20 knife and appeared to have some difficulty doing so; this indicates that they lacked access\n21 to a cut-down tool, a much more efficient tool for such a purpose.\n22 97.  My review of incident reports involving attempted suicides also identified a\n23 number of problems with Defendants' suicide prevention program. For example, an\n24 incident report from September 2012 indicates that prisoners in the booking area have\n25 access to material( a sheet) they can use to harm themselves. An incident report from\n26 November 2012 involved a prisoner who engaged in self-harm (using fingernails and part\n27 of a prisoner ID wristband to open aself-inflicted wound) and was placed in a safety cell;\n28 that prisoner was transferred directly from the safety cell to a general population holding\n(11407847] ~5  CV 13 2354 PSG\nDECL.

An incident report from\n2~~ Apri12013, in which a female prisoner ingested one ounce of Combat germicide solution,\n3 indicates that Defendants have poor control over items that can be used for self-harm.\n4 ~ Finally, an incident report from September 2013โwhere a deputy, without consulting with\n5 ~ mental health care staff or calling for backup, tased a mentally ill detainee who had\n6 ~ threatened suicide after the prisoner refused to surrender her spork and leave her cell\n7 ~ demonstrates that Defendants improperly use force against prisoners who are suicidal and\n8 who have mental illness.\n9 Defendants appear to lack an adequate quality improvement plan for identifying and\nfixing problems with the delivery of mental health care and especially for responding\n10 to completed and attempted suicides.\n11 98.  All adequately functioning correctional mental health systems must have a\n12 robust quality improvement process in place. A quality improvement program provides an\n13 essential forum for custody and medical staff to review performance, identify problems,\n14 and devise, implement, and evaluate solutions. A quality improvement process is\n15 particularly critical for ensuring the adequacy of a suicide prevention program. Close\n16 review of prisoners' attempted and completed suicides is necessary to understand where\n17 the suicide prevention program may have failed and to ensure such failures do not occur\n18 again.\n19 99.  According to policy, Defendants have a quality management program.\n20 ~ Pursuant to this policy, Defendants must conduct a medical review of all in-custody\n21 deaths, including suicides, and produce written findings that must note deficiencies and\n22 include corrective action plans. See Grunfeld Decl., Ex. G, at 31-32. The medical reviews\n23 of in-custody deaths are then supposed to be reviewed by the Quality Management/Peer\n24 Review Committee, which consists of key members of the custody and medical staff. See\n25 id. at 13.

Mr. Crow's suicide was discussed at two\n2 ~ Quality Assurance meetings. During the first meeting, on October 28, 2010, the discussion\n3 ~ in the minutes sets forth a chronology of Mr. Crow's time at the Jail and identified two\n4 ~ problems with the care provided to Mr. Crow. First, a psychologist had dictated a note\n5 ~ about an interaction with Mr. Crow, but the note was never placed in his medical file.\n6 Second, Mr. Crow complained of trouble sleeping a month and a half before he committed\n7 suicide, but he was not referred for a psychiatric consultation. According to the\n8 chronology, Mr. Crow was not seen by mental health care staff between the date of his\n9 complaint about sleeping and the date of his suicide. There is no recommendation for\n10 corrective action in the minutes.\n11 101.  The Quality Assurance Committee's second discussion of Mr. Crow's\n12 ~ suicide took place on January 27, 2011. This discussion was considerably shorter, and\n13 only indicated that the autopsy had been reviewed and the missing transcribed progress\n14 note had been posthumously placed in Mr. Crow's records. Again, there is no\n15 recommendation for corrective action.\n16 102.  If the quality improvement program's response to Mr. Crow's suicide is\n17 ~ indicative of Defendants' current quality improvement practices, they fall far short of an\n18 adequate. The Quality Improvement Committee should have examined Mr. Crow's\n19 suicide more closely to determine if any areas of the Jail's suicide prevention program\n20 needed to be addressed. In fact, the Committee identified two serious systematic problems\n21 ~ that may have contributed to Mr. Crow's suicide: the failure to refer him for psychiatric\n22 care when he requested it shortly before his death and the improper maintenance of his\n23 medical records. Nevertheless, the Committee did not propose any corrective action.\n24 103.  It should also be noted that, pursuant to policy, Defendants are only required\n25 to review in-custody completed suicides in the Quality Assurance Committee. There is no\n26 policy for reviewing suicide attempts.

I have significant experience evaluating overcrowded correctional systems.\n11\nIn 2008, I was one of the testifying experts in the Coleman v. Schwarzenegger trial before\n12\na federal threej udge district court; the question for the court was whether overcrowding\n13\nwas the primary cause of deficiencies in the medical and mental health care provided to\n14\nprisoners in the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. I have also\n15\nevaluated, testified about, and helped to manage psychiatric care in other overcrowded\n16\ncorrectional systems, including the San Francisco County Jail, the Georgia youth\n17\ncorrections system, and the California Youth Authority.\n18\n106.  Overcrowded facilities suffer from a number of problems: staffing shortages,\n19\ninsufficient treatment space, the unnecessary placement of prisoners in administrative\n20\nsegregation and other locked units, a marked increase in the number of prisoners\n21\nexperiencing psychiatric crisis, medical problems, and/or psychiatric decompensation, a\n22\nreduction in programs, and overcrowded, dangerous, and chaotic housing environments.\n23\nThese problems work as a feedback loop. A problem in one area tends to reinforce and\n24\nheighten problems in the other areas.\n25\n107.  Monterey County Jail has been and continues to be an overcrowded facility.\n26\nMr. Hackett, in his report regarding the security at the Jail, wrote that \"[b]y any definition,\n27\nthe jail population is such that the jail is overcrowded.\" Grunfeld Decl., Ex.

Both Dr. Puisis and TRG Consulting, in their reports about the problems\n8 ~ with the Jail, highlighted the gross insufficiency of available, confidential treatment space.\n9 Dr. Puisis found that none of the treatment spaces in the Jail were originally designed for\n10 clinical purposes. See Grunfeld Decl., Ex. J, at 8. He also found that nurses frequently\n11 evaluated prisoners in non-clinical, non-confidential spaces. See id. at 21. TRG\n12 Consulting, in their December 2011 report, wrote that \"[m]edical/mental health treatment\n13 spaces are not adequate for the rated beds, let alone the actual number of inmates held.\"\n14 Second Am. Compl., Ex. B (Dkt. No. 41), at EX. 3. A number of the Plaintiffs describe\n15 situations in which medical and mental health staff examined them in non-clinical, non-\n16 confidential settings. Examinations conducted in such circumstances, especially mental\n17 health evaluations in which prisoners communicate sensitive and personal information to\n18 the mental health care clinicians, are highly prone to error because of prisoners'\n19 understandable reluctance to speak earnestly. The lack of sufficient confidential treatment\n20 space in the Jail places prisoners at a substantial risk of serious harm by hindering their\n21 ability to request and receive adequate treatment.\n22 109.  TRG Consulting also highlighted how the overcrowding in the facility\n23 ~ \"forces the entire facility to operate as an indirect supervision jail. Mental health issues are\n24 considerably more difficult to recognize, manage and treat in an indirect supervision\n25 facility.\" Id. I agree with TRG Consulting's conclusion.\n26 110.  The Defendants in this case have acknowledged that the overcrowding in the\n27 Jail compromises their ability to deliver effective health care.

In my more than 25 years evaluating and working with correctional facilities,\n6 I have come across very few, if any, overcrowded facilities in which the overcrowding did\n7 not negatively affect the delivery of mental health care.

The deceased, Joshua Claypole (โClaypoleโ), \n19  had been at the jail for three days following his arrest for fatally stabbing a taxi driver.  Plaintiff \n20  asserts federal and state law claims on behalf of herself and Claypoleโs estate, seeking to impose \n21  liability upon the County of Monterey and other public entities and individuals who interacted \n22  with Claypole in the days before his death.   \n23    Two motions currently are before the Court:  (1) a motion by the City of Monterey \n24  (โCityโ), Monterey Police Chief Philip Penko (โPenkoโ), and Monterey Police Officer Brent Hall \n25  (โHallโ) (collectively, โCity Defendantsโ), seeking dismissal of the entire Complaint with \n26  prejudice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6); and (2) a motion by the County of \n27  Monterey (โCountyโ), Sheriff Scott Miller (โMillerโ), and Sergeant E. Kaye (โKayeโ) \n28  (collectively, โCounty Defendantsโ), seeking dismissal of certain claims under Federal Rule of \n\n \n1  Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and seeking to strike Plaintiffโs punitive damages request under Federal \n2  Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f).  The Court has considered the briefing and the oral argument \n3  presented at the hearing on October 2, 2014.  For the reasons discussed below, both motions to \n4  dismiss are GRANTED IN PART with leave to amend and the motion to strike is DENIED. \n5    I.  BACKGROUND1 \n6    Claypole was raised in Big Sur, California by his mother.  He started having mental health \n7  issues in high school, when he began exhibiting symptoms of anxiety, panic disorders, and bipolar \n8  disorder.  He saw a number of therapists and doctors, including doctors at Defendant Community \n9  Hospital of Monterey Peninsula (โCHOMPโ).  Claypole did well when he took his prescribed \n10  medications, but when he was not medicated he struggled to maintain normal behavior.  In late \n11  April 2013, he stopped sleeping, believed he had telepathy, and began acting in an aggressive and \n12  paranoid manner.  On April 29, 2013, he collected his belongings and left his motherโs home \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  without answering her questions about where he was going. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    April 30, 2013   \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15    At 1:00 a.m. on the morning of April 30, 2013, Claypole was arrested by California \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Highway Patrol officers in Redwood City, California on suspicion of driving under the influence.  \nS d nr\nee 17  He was booked and detained at the Maguire Correctional Facility operated by Defendant County \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  of San Mateo, and his car was impounded.  Facility staff took Claypoleโs medical history from \n19  him and then prescribed him three psychotropic medications that typically are used to treat bipolar \n20  disorder, schizophrenia, psychosis, and mania:  Hydroxyzine, Quetiapine, and Lithium Carbonate.  \n21  Claypole was released at 11:24 a.m. on the morning of April 30, 2013. \n22    May 1, 2013 \n23    At 8:30 a.m. on May 1, 2013, Claypole went to the outpatient behavioral health clinic at \n24  CHOMP, located in Monterey, California, where he had been treated in 2012.  CHOMP staff did \n25  not provide treatment to Claypole; instead, they told him to leave and called the Monterey Police \n26  Department (โMPDโ).  By the time MPD officers arrived, Claypole had left.  However, he \n27 \n                                                 \n1 The background facts are drawn from the allegations of the Complaint, which are accepted as \n28 \ntrue for pleading purposes. \n2 \n\n \n1  returned later that morning.  CHOMP personnel directed building security officers to escort \n2  Claypole out of the building and again called the MPD.2   \n3    After being ejected from CHOMP, Claypole went to a local Wells Fargo branch and \n4  withdrew money, then asked bank staff to call him a taxi.  Wells Fargo staff later told MPD \n5  officers that Claypole appeared โout of it,โ displayed mood changes, made strange movements \n6  with his head, and exhibited other unusual behavior.  Claypole got into the taxi and, at \n7  approximately 1:10 p.m., he fatally stabbed the taxi driver.  Shortly thereafter, he was detained by \n8  Seaside Police Department officers until MPD officers arrived and took custody.  Thereafter, \n9  while Claypole was seated in the back of Defendant Hallโs squad car, Claypole asked Hall, โCan \n10  you ask for the [lethal] injection?โ  Compl. ยถ 59.  He also told Hall that he โhad to do it.โ  Id.  \n11  Later, during booking, Claypole asked Hall, โShould I go?  I should just take the injection.โ  Id. ยถ \n12  60.  While waiting to be interviewed by a detective, Claypole asked Hall, โIs my mom going to get \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  my remains?โ  Id. ยถ 61.   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    MPD thereafter transferred custody of Claypole to the Monterey County Sheriffโs \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Department.  Neither Hall nor any other MPD officer informed County personnel that Claypole \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  was acting strangely or that he might be a suicide risk.  At approximately 8:30 p.m. on May 1, \nS d nr\nee 17  2013, Claypole met with his criminal defense attorney.  After the meeting, Claypoleโs attorney \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  asked Officer Candi McGregor at the jail to place Claypole on suicide watch.  Officer McGregor \n19  contacted the on-duty Sergeant, Kaye.  An Intake Health Screening form completed shortly \n20  thereafter shows the โnoโ box checked for โDoes behavior suggest danger to self or others?โ  A \n21  Classification Inmate Intake Screening Questionnaire completed that same night indicates that \n22  Claypole had not shown any bizarre behavior and that he had not been under psychiatric care.  It is \n23  not clear whether medical personnel administered these screenings.  It does not appear that \n24  Claypole was given any other mental health evaluation or treatment.  Nor was he placed on suicide \n25  watch at that time despite his attorneyโs request. \n26   \n27 \n                                                 \n2 There are no allegations that CHOMP recognized Claypole as a former patient or that the MPD \n28 \nmade contact with him when responding to CHOMPโs calls.  \n3 \n\n \n1    May 2, 2013 \n2    On May 2, 2013, Claypoleโs attorney visited him again.  Claypole asked if his mother \n3  could bring his medications to the jail.   \n4    May 3, 2013 \n5    On May 3, 2013, Claypole made his first court appearance.  He was mentally unstable, and \n6  he believed that others were speaking to him telepathically.  His attorney assumed (incorrectly) \n7  that Claypole had been placed on suicide watch.  Claypole finally was placed on suicide watch at \n8  2:35 p.m. on May 3, at which time he was transferred to a safety cell. \n9  May 4, 2013 \n10    Approximately sixteen hours later, at 6:30 a.m. on Saturday, May 4, 2013, Claypole was \n11  taken off suicide watch and moved from the safety cell to a cell in A Pod, an administrative \n12  segregation housing unit.  No mental health personnel work at the jail on weekends; it is unclear \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  who ordered Claypole taken off suicide watch.  At 1:00 p.m. that afternoon, Plaintiff arrived to \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  visit Claypole and deliver his medications.  Jail staff refused to allow her to see Claypole, stating \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  that he had been moved to a new unit and that visitation hours for that unit had not begun.  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Plaintiff gave the medications to a jail nurse.  The medications were not provided to Claypole.   \nS d nr\nee 17    Although jail policy required staff to check Claypole hourly, the Hourly Safety Check log \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  indicates that staff did not check on him for more than six hours.  At approximately 2:30 p.m., \n19  non-party Deputy Sheriff Raymond Gordano (โGordanoโ) found Claypole in his cell, hanging \n20  from a noose made of torn bed sheets that had been attached to a metal brace on the wall.  \n21  Gordano did not immediately open the cell or cut Claypole down; instead, he requested and waited \n22  for backup.  After other staff arrived, Claypole was cut down and the noose was cut with a knife.  \n23  Claypole was transferred to the custody of emergency room personnel at Natividad Medical \n24  Center, and then he was transported via helicopter to San Jose Regional Medical Center.  He was \n25  pronounced dead on May 9, 2013.  A postmortem examination determined that he died from \n26  asphyxia due to hanging.   \n27    A handwritten note was found in Claypoleโs cell, reading:  โI love you mama.  Iโm sorry \n28  for all the pain I have brought you mama.  I love you very much.  Maybe I will see you again.  \n4 \n\n \n1  Love, Joshua.โ  Compl. ยถ 80.  \n2    Plaintiff sues the County of San Mateo; San Mateo County Sheriff Greg Munks; the \n3  County of Monterey; Miller; Kaye; the City of Monterey; Penko; Hall; California Forensic \n4  Medical Group (โCFMGโ)3; Dr. Taylor Fithian4; and CHOMP.  Plaintiff asserts the following \n5  claims:  (1) a ยง 1983 claim for deliberate indifference in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; \n6  (2) a ยง 1983 claim for deliberate indifference in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment5; (3) a ยง \n7  1983 claim for deprivation of substantive due process in violation of the First and Fourteenth \n8  Amendments (causing loss of parent/child relationship); (4) professional negligence/medical \n9  malpractice claim under California law; (5) failure to furnish medical care under California law; \n10  (6) negligent supervision, training, hiring, and retention under California law; and (7) wrongful \n11  death under California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 377.60.  \n12    II.  LEGAL STANDARD \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13    โA motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  claim upon which relief can be granted โtests the legal sufficiency of a claim.โโ  Conservation \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Force v.

When determining whether a claim has been stated, the Court accepts \nS d nr\nee 17  as true all well-pled factual allegations and construes them in the light most favorable to the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  plaintiff.  Reese v. BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc., 643 F.3d 681, 690 (9th Cir. 2011).  However, the \n19  Court need not โaccept as true allegations that contradict matters properly subject to judicial \n20  noticeโ or โallegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or \n21  unreasonable inferences.โ  In re Gilead Scis.

While a complaint need not contain detailed \n23 \n                                                 \n3 CFMG is a private health care provider that services approximately sixty-five correctional \n24 \nfacilities in California, including the Monterey County Jail. \n \n25 \n4 Taylor Fithian is the co-founder, President, and Medial Director of CFMG.   \n \n26 \n5 Although Claim 1 is labeled โDeliberate Indifference to Serious Medical and Mental Health \nNeedsโ and Claim 2 is labeled โFailure to Protect from Harm,โ both clearly are deliberate \n27 \nindifference claims.  The claims contain the identical allegation that Defendantsโ conduct \nโconstituted deliberate indifference to Joshua Claypoleโs serious medical needs, health, and \n28 \nsafety.โ  Compl. ยถยถ 87 (Claim 1) and 95 (Claim 2). \n5 \n\n \n1  factual allegations, it โmust contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to โstate a claim to \n2  relief that is plausible on its face.โโ  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. \n3  Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  A claim is facially plausible when it โallows the \n4  court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.โ  Id. \n5    III.  CITY DEFENDANTSโ MOTION TO DISMISS \n6    The City, Penko, and Hall are named as defendants in only two of the seven claims \n7  asserted in this lawsuit:  Claim 2 for deliberate indifference in violation of the Fourteenth \n8  Amendment; and Claim 3 for deprivation of substantive due process in violation of the First and \n9  Fourteenth Amendments.  They seek dismissal of both claims with prejudice. \n10    A.  Claim 2 โ Deliberate Indifference \n11    Claim 2 asserts a ยง 1983 claim against the City Defendants and others based upon their \n12  alleged deliberate indifference to Claypoleโs serious medical needs, health, and safety in violation \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Read liberally, the claim alleges that Hall knew that Claypole was \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  suicidal and failed to respond appropriately; and that Penko and the City failed to maintain \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  policies and procedures, or provide adequate training and supervision, to ensure that MPD officers \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  informed other agencies of known suicide risks when transferring custody of an arrestee.  See \nS d nr\nee 17  Compl. ยถ 93.  The City Defendants argue that they did not owe any duty to Claypole at the time of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  his death; the actions of the County Defendants were a superseding cause that precludes any \n19  liability against the City Defendants; and Penko did not have any contact with Claypole or take \n20  any action that could render him individually liable to Plaintiff.    \n21    โTo succeed on a ยง 1983 claim, a plaintiff must show that (1) the conduct complained of \n22  was committed by a person acting under color of state law; and (2) the conduct deprived the \n23  plaintiff of a federal constitutional or statutory right.โ  Patel v. Kent School Dist., 648 F.3d 965, \n24  971 (9th Cir. 2011).  Here, the City, Penko, and Hall do not challenge their status as state actors \n25  for ยง 1983 purposes.  They contend that Plaintiff has not alleged facts showing that they deprived \n26  Claypole of Fourteenth Amendment rights. \n27    โ[T]he Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause generally does not confer any \n28  affirmative right to governmental aid, even where such aid may be necessary to secure life, liberty, \n6 \n\n \n1  or property interests.โ  Id.  โThere are two exceptions to this rule: (1) when a โspecial relationshipโ \n2  exists between the plaintiff and the state (the special-relationship exception); and (2) when the \n3  state affirmatively places the plaintiff in danger by acting with โdeliberate indifferenceโ to a \n4  โknown or obvious dangerโ (the state-created danger exception).โ  Id. at 971-72 (internal citations \n5  omitted).  โIf either exception applies, a stateโs omission or failure to protect may give rise to a ยง \n6  1983 claim.โ  Id. at 972. \n7    In the context of arrest or pretrial detention, the Fourteenth Amendment confers a right to \n8  be free from cruel and unusual punishment, which encompasses a right to have serious medical \n9  needs addressed.  Simmons v. Navajo Cnty., 609 F.3d 1011, 1017 (9th Cir. 2010); Gibson v. Cnty \n10  of Washoe, 290 F.3d 1175, 1187 (9th Cir. 2002).  โ[A] heightened suicide risk can present a \n11  serious medical need.โ  Simmons, 609 F.3d at 1018.  An officer effects a deprivation of Fourteenth \n12  Amendment rights if he or she is deliberately indifferent to a detaineeโs serious medical needs.  Id. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  at 1017; see also Clouthier v. Cnty. of Contra Costa, 591 F.3d 1232, 1241 (9th Cir. 2010) (โWe \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  have long analyzed claims that correction facility officials violated pretrial detaineesโ \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  constitutional rights by failing to address their medical needs (including suicide prevention) under \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  a โdeliberate indifferenceโ standard.โ).    \nS d nr\nee 17    โA prison official cannot be liable for deliberate indifference unless he or she โknows of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts \n19  from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must \n20  also draw the inference.โโ  Simmons, 609 F.3d at 1017 (quoting Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, \n21  837 (1994)).  โIn other words, a plaintiff must show that the official was (a) subjectively aware of \n22  the serious medical need and (b) failed adequately to respond.โ  Id. at 1017-18 (internal quotation \n23  marks and citation omitted). \n24      1.  Duty \n25    The City Defendants argue that they did not owe Claypole any duty at the time of his death \n26  because the special relationship created by the MPDโs custody of Claypole ended when custody \n27  was transferred to the County, and the MPD did not place Claypole in danger prior to the transfer. \n28    A special relationship clearly existed during the period in which the MPD had custody of \n7 \n\n \n1  Claypole.  See DeShaney v.Winnebago Cnty. Depโt of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 199-200 (1989) \n2  (โwhen the State takes a person into its custody and holds him there against his will, the \n3  Constitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety \n4  and general well-beingโ).  The City Defendants do not suggest otherwise.  While that special \n5  relationship existed, and before it terminated as a result of transfer of custody to the County, the \n6  City Defendants are charged with failing to take required actions consistent with their duty of care.  \n7  It is alleged that while in City custody, Claypole made a number of statements to Hall that could \n8  be viewed as suicidal.  Moreover, while Plaintiff does not allege any specific facts regarding \n9  Claypoleโs general behavior when he was with Hall, her allegations regarding his bizarre conduct \n10  both before and after Hall had custody of him give rise to an inference that he behaved bizarrely \n11  with Hall as well.6   \n12    Viewing the complaint in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, it is plausibly alleged that \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Hall was subjectively aware that Claypole was suicidal and nonetheless failed to request a mental \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  health assessment or even inform Claypoleโs next custodian, the County, of that critical fact.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Those allegations are sufficient to make out a deliberate indifference claim.  Plaintiff plausibly \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  alleges that the harm to Claypole โ his suicide three days later โ was caused, at least in part, by the \nS d nr\nee 17  City Defendantsโ failure to provide medical care and failure to advise the Monterey County Jail \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  staff of Claypoleโs suicidal statements and bizarre behavior while in City custody.  Cf. Lum v. \n19  Cnty. of San Joaquin, 756 F. Supp. 2d 1243, 1254-58 (E.D. Cal. 2010) (finding viable a wrongful \n20  death claim based in part upon jail staffโs failure to assess the decedentโs medical status or provide \n21  medical care while he was in custody, where decedent was found floating in a nearby river three \n22  days after his release from jail).   \n23    Plaintiff does not assert any pleading deficiencies with respect to the official capacity \n24  claims against Penko or the Monell7 claims against the City; they rely solely upon their contention \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n6 Taking Plaintiffโs allegations as true, it is highly unlikely that Claypole behaved strangely at \nCHOMP, at Wells Fargo, and at the jail with his attorney, but had a moment of clarity while with \n27 \nHall. \n \n28 \n7 Monell v. New York City Depโt of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658 (1978). \n8 \n\n \n1  that Plaintiff has failed to allege an underlying violation of Claypoleโs rights.  Consequently, the \n2  City Defendants have failed to demonstrate that they are entitled to dismissal of Plaintiffsโ claims. \n3      2.  Superseding Cause \n4    The City Defendants contend that their conduct could not have been the proximate cause of \n5  Claypoleโs death.  See Clouthier, 591 F.3d at 1245 n.3 (โto prevail on a ยง 1983 claim under a \n6  deliberate indifference theory, plaintiff must prove that the officialโs actions were both the actual \n7  and proximate cause of plaintiffโs injuriesโ) (citing White v. Roper, 901 F.2d 1501, 1505 (9th Cir. \n8  1990)).  Specifically, the City Defendants contend that the actions of the County in first imposing, \n9  and then removing, a suicide watch constituted a superseding cause that precludes any liability \n10  against them.   \n11    In ยง 1983 actions, โ[t]raditional tort law defines intervening causes that break the chain of \n12  proximate causation.โ  Van Ort v. Estate of Stanewich, 92 F.3d 831, 837 (9th Cir. 1996) (citation \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  omitted).  A defendantโs conduct is not the proximate cause of the plaintiffโs injury โif another \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  cause intervenes and supersedes his liability for the subsequent events.โ  White, 901 F.2d at 1506.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  However, โ[t]he courts are quite generally agreed that [foreseeable] intervening causes . . . will not \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  supersede the defendantโs responsibility.โ  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) \nS d nr\nee 17  (alteration in original).  If reasonable persons could differ on the question of foreseeability, the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  question should be left to a jury.  Id.   \n19    The gist of the City Defendantsโ argument is that they were entitled to expect the County \n20  to undertake any necessary precautions or treatment with respect to Claypoleโs mental health; the \n21  County did take such precautions; and the City could not have foreseen โ and cannot be held \n22  responsible for โ the Countyโs decisions to place Claypole on and then remove him from suicide \n23  watch.  However, Plaintiff alleges that when Claypole arrived at the jail he was given only a \n24  cursory mental health screening, which resulted in check-box determinations that he was not a \n25  danger to himself and had no history of psychiatric treatment.  The County did not place Claypole \n26  on suicide watch until he had been at the jail for two days.  Had Hall informed the County that \n27  Claypole was suicidal, the County may well have performed a more thorough mental health \n28  evaluation upon intake, medicated Claypole, and/or maintained the suicide watch for a longer \n9 \n\n \n1  period of time.  Accordingly, the Court cannot conclude as a matter of law that the Countyโs \n2  conduct constituted a superseding cause that cuts off any potential liability on the part of the City \n3  Defendants. \n4      3.  Penko \n5    โA defendant may be held liable as a supervisor under ยง 1983 if there exists either (1) his \n6  or her personal involvement in the constitutional deprivation, or (2) a sufficient causal connection \n7  between the supervisorโs wrongful conduct and the constitutional violation.โ  Starr v. Baca, 652 \n8  F.3d 1202, 1207 (9th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  โThe requisite \n9  causal connection can be established . . . by setting in motion a series of acts by others, . . . or by \n10  knowingly refus[ing] to terminate a series of acts by others, which [the supervisor] knew or \n11  reasonably should have known would cause others to inflict a constitutional injury.โ  Id. (internal \n12  quotation marks and citation omitted) (alterations in original).  โA supervisor can be liable in his \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  individual capacity for his own culpable action or inaction in the training, supervision, or control \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  of his subordinates; for his acquiescence in the constitutional deprivation; or for conduct that \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  showed a reckless or callous indifference to the rights of others.โ  Id. (internal quotation marks and \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  citation omitted). \nS d nr\nee 17    The Complaint alleges generally that โPenko is and was responsible for the hiring, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  screening, training, retention, supervision, discipline, counseling, and control of all Monterey \n19  Police Department employees and/or agents,โ and that โPenko also is and was responsible for the \n20  promulgation of the policies and procedures and allowance of the practices/customs pursuant to \n21  which the acts of the Monterey Police Department alleged herein were committed.โ  Compl. ยถ 17.  \n22  Bare allegations of this nature are insufficient; some specific facts regarding Penkoโs knowledge \n23  or conduct must be pled to make out a plausible claim against him in his individual capacity.  See, \n24  e.g., Starr, 652 F.3d at 1208-12 (reciting the plaintiffโs detailed allegations regarding the \n25  defendant sheriffโs knowledge of misconduct by his subordinate jail officials). \n26    Accordingly, the motion to dismiss Claim 2 is GRANTED with leave to amend as to the \n27  claim against Penko in his individual capacity and otherwise is DENIED.   \n28   \n10 \n\n \n1    B.  Claim 3 โ Substantive Due Process  \n2    Claim 3 asserts a substantive due process claim against the City Defendants and others.  \n3  โThe substantive due process right to family integrity or to familial association is well \n4  established.โ  Rosenbaum v. Washoe Cnty., 663 F.3d 1071, 1079 (9th Cir. 2011).  โA parent has a \n5  โfundamental liberty interestโ in companionship with his or her child.โ  Id. (citing Kelson v. City of \n6  Springfield, 767 F.2d 651, 654-55 (9th Cir. 1985)).  In order to make out a violation of substantive \n7  due process, the harmful conduct must shock the conscience or offend notions of fair play and \n8  decency.  Id.   \n9    The City Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot make out a claim against them because she \n10  has failed to allege facts showing that they violated Claypoleโs constitutional rights or caused his \n11  death.  However, as discussed above, Plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to state a claim for \n12  deliberate indifference as to all City Defendants except for Penko in his individual capacity.  \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Because the conduct alleged, if true, would shock the conscience, the Court concludes that \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Plaintiff has stated a substantive due process claim as well.   \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15    Accordingly, the motion to dismiss Claim 3 is GRANTED with leave to amend as to the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  claim against Penko in his individual capacity and otherwise is DENIED. \nS d nr\nee 17    IV.  COUNTY DEFENDANTSโ MOTION TO DISMISS AND TO STRIKE  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18    The County Defendants are named as defendants in all seven claims asserted in the \n19  Complaint.  However, they move to dismiss only four:  Claim 4 for professional negligence; \n20  Claim 5 for failure to furnish medical care; Claim 6 for negligent supervision, training, hiring, and \n21  retention; and Claim 7 for wrongful death.  They also move to strike Plaintiffโs punitive damages \n22  request.  \n23    A.  Claim 4 - Professional Negligence \n24    Claim 4 asserts that the County Defendants and others committed professional negligence \n25  by failing to provide appropriate evaluation and treatment of Claypole.  Based upon a careful \n26  review of the allegations of the Complaint and the colloquy between the Court and Plaintiffโs \n27  counsel at the hearing, it appears clear that Claim 4 is a claim for medical malpractice.  Because \n28  none of the County Defendants is a medical professional, a claim of medical malpractice does not \n11 \n\n \n1  lie against them.  See Silverbrand v. Woodford, No. CV 06-3253-R (CW), 2010 WL 3635780, at \n2  *8 (Aug. 18, 2010) (dismissing medical malpractice claims against corrections officers who were \n3  not medical professionals).  \n4    Plaintiffโs reliance on Lum, 756 F. Supp. 2d 1243, is misplaced.  In Lum, parents asserted \n5  claims against public entities and officials arising out of the detention and subsequent death of \n6  their son.  The decedent had been arrested for public intoxication at approximately 1:00 a.m. and \n7  booked on a โkickoutโ charge, meaning he would be released from jail six hours later.  At the time \n8  of his arrest, the decedent had a cut on his foot, vomit on his shirt, and was behaving strangely.  A \n9  blood test showed no alcohol in his system; he stated that he was bipolar and took medication; and \n10  he had hallucinations and a seizure in his holding cell.  However, the jail staff did not order a \n11  medical or psychiatric evaluation.  Instead, they released the decedent at 7:30 a.m. โwithout \n12  successful family notification, transportation, money, phone, or shoes.โ  Id. at 1247.  His body was \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  found in the nearby San Joaquin River a few days later.  The Court of Appeals concluded that \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  under those circumstances the parents could make out negligence claims against the arresting \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  officers and jail personnel that would not be barred by governmental immunities.  Id. at 1256.  The \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  court did not, however, find that the parents could make out professional negligence claims. \nS d nr\nee 17    Accordingly, the motion to dismiss Claim 4 is GRANTED without leave to amend the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  claim of professional negligence against the County Defendants but with leave to amend to add a \n19  garden-variety negligence claim against the County Defendants, if appropriate. \n20    B.  Claim 5 - Failure to Furnish Medical Care \n21    Claim 5 seeks to impose liability upon the County Defendants and others for failure to \n22  furnish or summon medical care while Claypole was held at the jail.  The claim alleges that \n23  although โDefendants owed Joshua Claypole a duty of care to provide him immediate medical and \n24  mental health care,โ โDefendants failed to take reasonable action to summon or provide that care, \n25  resulting in Joshua Claypoleโs death.โ  Compl. ยถยถ 109-10.  The Monterey County Defendants \n26  contend that the County is immune from suit under California Government Code ยง 844.6 and that \n27  Plaintiff has not pled facts sufficient to come within the exception to immunity set forth in \n28  California Government Code ยง 845.6.  \n12 \n\n \n1    Section 844.6 provides that, with certain enumerated exceptions, โa public entity is not \n2  liable for . . .  an injury to any prisoner.โ  Cal. Govโt Code ยง 844.6(a).  One of the enumerated \n3  exceptions is California Government Code ยง 845.6, which provides in relevant part that โa public \n4  employee, and the public entity where the employee is acting within the scope of his employment, \n5  is liable if the employee knows or has reason to know that the prisoner is in need of immediate \n6  medical care and he fails to take reasonable action to summon such medical care.โ  Cal. Govโt \n7  Code ยง 845.6 (emphasis added).   \n8    The County Defendants argue that Claim 5 does not fall within this exception because the \n9  Complaint reveals that medical care in fact was furnished.  To the extent that the County \n10  Defendants rely on allegations regarding medical screening administered to Claypole after Kaye \n11  was informed of Claypoleโs suicidal ideation, it is unclear from the record whether that screening \n12  was given by medical personnel or whether initiating the screening constituted โreasonable action \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  to summonโ medical care.  See Compl. ยถยถ 63-65.  To the extent that the County Defendants rely \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  on allegations regarding the care given after Claypole was discovered hanging in his cell, it is \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  unclear from the record whether Gordanoโs decision to wait for backup before cutting Claypole \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  down constituted โreasonableโ action.  See Compl. ยถ 74.  While the County Defendants ultimately \nS d nr\nee 17  may be able to prove that they are not subject to liability under Section 845.6, it would be \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  inappropriate to make that factual determination at the pleading stage.   \n19    Accordingly, the motion to dismiss Claim 5 is DENIED. \n20    C.  Claim 6 โ Negligent Supervision, Training, Hiring, and Retention and   \n21      Claim 7 โ Wrongful Death \n22    Claim 6 asserts that the County Defendants are liable for negligent supervision, training, \n23  hiring, and retention, while Claim 7 asserts that they are liable for negligent or wrongful acts that \n24  caused Claypoleโs death.  The County argues that it is immune from these claims, relying on \n25  California Government Code ยง 815, which provides that a public entity is not liable for any injury \n26  except as otherwise provided by statute.  Cal. Govโt Code ยง 815(a).  As discussed above, Section \n27  845.6 permits claims against a public entity based upon its employeesโ failure to furnish medical \n28  care.  Thus the Court concludes that Plaintiffโs claims are viable to the extent they are based upon \n13 \n\n \n1  the Countyโs negligence in supervising and training its employees regarding the furnishing of \n2  mental health care.  See Bock v. Cnty. of Sutter, No. 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-GGH, 2012 WL \n3  3778953, at *18-19 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 31, 2012) (denying motion to dismiss claims for negligent \n4  supervision and wrongful death that were based upon jail personnelโs failure to furnish medical \n5  care). \n6    Accordingly, the motion to dismiss Claim 6 and Claim 7 is DENIED. \n7    D.  Punitive Damages \n8    The County Defendants move to strike Plaintiffโs request for punitive damages under Rule \n9  12(f).  The Ninth Circuit has held that Rule 12(f) is not the appropriate vehicle for a challenge to \n10  punitive damages at the pleading stage, and has directed that such a challenge should be brought \n11  under Rule 12(b)(6).  Whittlestone, Inc. v. Handi-Craft Co., 618 F.3d 970, 974 (9th Cir. 2010).  \n12  Even if the motion had been brought under Rule 12(b)(6), however, the Court would not be \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  inclined to entertain it at this stage in the proceedings.  If and when appropriate after summary \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  judgment or trial, the Court will take up the issue of whether punitive damages are available in this \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  action. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16    Accordingly, the County Defendantsโ motion to strike is DENIED. \nS d nr\nee 17    V.  ORDER \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18    For the foregoing reasons, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: \n19    (1)  The City of Monterey Defendantsโ motion to dismiss is GRANTED as to Plaintiffโs \n20      claims against Penko in his individual capacity, with leave to amend, and otherwise \n21      is DENIED.  If Plaintiff is unable to allege additional facts against Penko in his  \n22      individual capacity by the deadline for amendment but discovers such facts at a  \n23      later date, she may seek leave to amend her pleading to reallege claims against  \n24      Penko in his individual capacity.  \n25    (2)  The County of Monterey Defendantsโ motion to dismiss is GRANTED as to Claim \n26      4 without leave to amend the claim of professional negligence but with leave to  \n27      amend to add a garden-variety negligence claim, if appropriate.  The County of  \n28      Monterey Defendantsโ motion to dismiss otherwise is DENIED, and their motion to \n14 \n\n \n1      strike is DENIED.   \n2    (3)  Leave to amend is limited to the pleading deficiencies identified herein.  Plaintiff  \n3      may not add any other claims or other parties without express leave of court. \n4    (4)  Any amended complaint shall be filed on or before October 28, 2014.  \n5   \n6  Dated:  October 9, 2014 \n7  ______________________________________ \nBETH LABSON FREEMAN \n8  United States District Judge \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13 \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr\nee 17 \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n15 ",
