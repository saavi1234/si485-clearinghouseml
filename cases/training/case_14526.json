    "summary": "<p>On December 16, 2014, the estate of an inmate who died in jail filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs sued Monterey County, the Monterey County Sheriff, the Monterey County Jail, and the California Forensic Medical Group under 42 U.S.C. ยง1983. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought monetary and injunctive relief, claiming a failure to provide medical care in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and a deprivation of substantive due process in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The plaintiffs also claimed negligence and wrongful death under California state law. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants left the inmate lying unconscious, helpless, and untreated in his bed to die from viral influenza syndrome complicated by pneumoniaโa treatable condition. At the time of the inmate's death, the jail was already the subject of a class action lawsuit regarding systemic failures to provide adequate medical care. <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13198\"><i>Hernandez v. County of Monterey</i></a>. On June 6, 2016, the case was reassigned to Judge Beth Labson Freeman.</p><p>On April 21, 2015, the parties agreed to enter into settlement negotiations; a settlement conference was scheduled for October 30, 2015. The parties could not come to a settlement agreement at that conference. Further settlement discussions continued through April and June 2017, but the parties did not settle.</p><p>In October 2017, the plaintiff filed a stipulation and proposed order with the court for the dismissal of defendant California Forensic Medical Group. The court approved it.</p><p>That same day, the defendant Sheriff filed a motion for partial summary judgment as to the claims against him. He claimed that he could not be liable because the plaintiffs could not show that on January 15, 2014, the defendant Sheriff knew the plaintiff had faced a substantial risk of serious harm and disregarded that risk by failing to take reasonable steps to abate it. Moreover, the defendant Sheriff argued that the doctrine of qualified immunity shielded him from liability for civil damages because his conduct did not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.</p><p>On April 6, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part this defendant Sheriffโs motion. Judge Freeman granted the motion as to the plaintiff's first cause of action pursuant to ยง 1983 for deliberate indifference to the plaintiff's serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment and granted the motion as to Plaintiffsโ second cause of action pursuant to ยง 1983 for loss of the parent/child relationship in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. These claims were dismissed. The court denied the motion, however, as to the plaintiffsโ alleged violations of California state tort law.</p><p>The parties continued to engage in discovery and motion in limine briefing through the rest of 2018. At the same time, they continued to engage in settlement conferences and reached a settlement for monetary damages in early 2019. On January 23, 2019, the plaintiff filed a motion for settlement approval. The court approved the settlement agreement on March 18, 2019. The plaintiff then voluntarily dismissed the case on April 29, 2019. This case is closed.</p>",

With respect to this lawsuit, Deputy Collins is alleged \n9  to be the last deputy to have seen Mr. Parenti alive.  On January 15, 2014, Deputy Collins was \n10  assigned to the Rehabilitation Unit building at the jail, where he had been assigned for the \n11  preceding ten years, since 2004. Id.  Specifically, on the day at issue, Deputy Collins was working \n12  the day shift and was assigned to the B/C Wing.  See Declaration of Janet L. Holmes (โHolmes \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Decl.โ), ECF 100-4, Exh D, Deposition of Timmy Collins (โCollins Depo.โ) 16:13-24; 19:11-19, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  49:3-50:18; Collins Decl. ยถยถ 2, 4.    \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Deputy Collins testified that he knew Mr. Parenti because Mr. Parenti had been in and out \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  of the Monterey jail over the years.

Deputy Collins also knew that Mr. \nS d nr\nee 17  Parenti was not a drug smuggler or someone who was arrested for transportation or sale because \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Mr. Parenti was cleared to work in the kitchen.  Id. 81:19-82:14.  Deputy Collins recalled that Mr. \n19  Parenti was a โpretty decent worker,โ who didnโt complain, was quiet, and stayed to himself, \n20  which Deputy Collins described as โa good thing.โ  Id.  In fact, Mr. Parenti was seen by jail staff \n21  as a โmodel inmateโ who was polite, cooperative, quiet, and a good worker.

Collins Depo. 159:5-16.  Deputy Collins further \n4  testified that he had no information about any of Mr. Parentiโs medical issues.  Id. 115:8-12.   \n5  Dr. Taylor Fithian (โDr. Fithianโ) was the staff psychiatrist and Medical Director with \n6  Defendant California Forensics Medical Group (โCFMGโ).  See Fithian Depo. 6:6-9.  The County \n7  of Monterey contracted with CFMG to provide medical and mental health services for inmates at \n8  the County Jail.  See Declaration of James Bass (โBass Decl.โ) ยถ 3, Exh. A, ECF 100-2.5  As part \n9  of his duties, Dr. Fithian was partly responsible for policies and procedures, and for supervision of \n10  medical staff at the Monterey County Jail.  See Fithian Depo. 6:16-7:5.  Dr. Fithian was generally \n11  present at the Monterey County Jail on a daily basis from Monday through Friday during the \n12  relevant time period from 2013 to 2014.  Id. 20:7-15.  Under the procedures in place in December \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  2013 and January 2014, inmates could sign themselves up for a psychiatric โsick callโ by filling \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  out a slip.

A โsick call listโ would be generated for each \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  housing unit at the jail, with medical sick calls separated from psychiatric.  Id. 16:13-25. \nS d nr\nee 17  In early January 2014, Mr. Parenti filled out several sick slips, seeking treatment for \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  various medical issues including a cancerous skin lesion on his nose, what he described on a slip \n19  as having the flu, and other requests to see the psychiatrist for adjustment of psychiatric \n20  medications.  Rifkin Decl. Volume I, Exh. 209 at 2-7.  On January 13, 2014, Mr. Parenti was seen \n21  by a nurse at the jail who prescribed him medication for a cold.  See Rifkin Decl. Volume II, \n22  Deposition of Maureen Hollcraft (โHollcraft Depo.โ) at 64:19-69:5; Ex. 209 at 1, 8.  On January \n23  14, 2014, Mr. Parenti reported increased anxiety and depression to a psychiatric nurse.  Rifkin \n24  Decl. Volume I, Exh. 209 at 8.  The nurse scheduled Mr. Parenti for a โroutine psychiatric sick \n25 \n                                                 \n26 \n4 Along with Jace Esquivel, these three declarations are from inmates housed in the D-wing of the \nRehabilitation Unit of the Monterey County Jail who knew Mr. Parenti and witnessed the events \n27 \nof January 15, 2014.   \n5 At all relevant times, James Bass was employed by the County of Monterey Sheriffโs Office as \n28 \nthe Commander serving as the medical liaison with CFMG at the jail.

Rehabilitation Unit at Monterey County Jail  \n3  Mr. Parenti was housed in โD-wingโ at the Monterey County Jail, which is referred to as \n4  โdormโ or โpodโ housing for approximately 85 men in bunk beds.  See Rifkin Decl. Volume I, \n5  Transcript of January 15, 2014 Interview of Deputy Collins (โCollins Interview 1/15/2014โ), Exh. \n6  207 at 2:2-6; Exh. 27A.  D-wing is part of a group of five housing pods comprising โRehab 2,โโ\n7  or the Rehabilitation Unit6โwhich includes wings B, C, D, E, and F.  See Rifkin Decl. Volume II, \n8  Deposition of Deputy Olio Guerrero (โGuerrero Depo.โ) 16:12-20:7, 26:16-27:4.  The layout of \n9  the Rehabilitation Unit where Mr. Parentiโs dorm was located was essentially an octagon, with the \n10  Control 5 tower slightly elevated in the center and the various wings radiating out.  See Collins \n11  Depo. 101:5-16.  Four jail deputies oversaw the pods in Rehab 2, which encompassed the D-\n12  Wing: one โControl 5โ deputy mans the control tower; two โhallway deputiesโ share responsibility \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  for E and F pods and the yard; and one โB/C-wing deputyโ is responsible for B, C, and D pods.  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Guerrero Depo. at 16:12-20:7, 26:16-27:4.

Collins Depo. 86:3-14.  Mr. Parenti was on the psychiatric sick call list for a visit with \n3  Dr. Fithian, but not for a medical emergency.  Fithian Depo. 23:22-24:12.  After Dr. Fithian \n4  completed his visits with inmates on the C wing, he asked Deputy Collins to accompany him to \n5  see people on the D wing, where Mr. Parenti was housed.  Collins Depo. 85:21-86:10.  At \n6  approximately 9:45 a.m., Deputy Collins went to the entrance of D-wing and called out the list of \n7  three or four people on the sick call list, including Mr. Parenti.  See Wolfe Decl. ยถ 10; Collins \n8  Depo. 86:9-14.  Mr. Parenti did not show up or respond.  Wolfe Decl. ยถ 11; Collins Depo. 86:12-\n9  14.  Deputy Collins called his name again.  Collins Depo.  86:9-14.  Kenny Packer, one of the \n10  other inmates in the D wing, told Deputy Collins that Mr. Parenti was sleeping.  Id. 86:15-16.   \n11  Deputy Collins looked toward Mr. Parentiโs bunk, and because no one was trying to wake \n12  him, Deputy Collins decided to go down the D-wing to check if Mr. Parenti wanted to see Dr. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Fithian.  Id. 86:19-23.  As Deputy Collins walked down the wing, he could see Mr. Parenti lying \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  on his stomach with his head facing the wall, and he testified that he could hear that Parenti was \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  snoring.  Id. 87:7-11.  Deputy Collins testified that Mr. Parentiโs snoring was not โraspy,โ but \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  rather โsounded like normal snoring.โ Id. 93:20-23.  Deputy Collins further testified that Mr. \nS d nr\nee 17  Parenti โdidnโt appear to be in any kind of distress.  He was obviously breathing.  He was snoring, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  which appeared to me as a normal breathing pattern.โ Id. 173:6-20. \n19  According to Deputy Collins, he approached the bunk and tapped Mr. Parenti on the \n20  shoulder several times, and he was slow to wake up.  Id. 87:7-14.  Deputy Collins testified that \n21  Mr. Parenti turned his head toward Deputy Collins, and Collins asked him: โDo you want to see \n22  the doctor?โ Collins Depo. 87:11-14.  Deputy Collins testified that Mr. Parenti grumbled \n23  something in response, which Collins thought was okay because he was โactually sleeping pretty \n24  hard.โ Id. 87:15-19.  Deputy Collins decided to let Mr. Parenti sleep.  Id. 87:18-19.  In contrast, \n25  the sworn affidavits of four inmate witnesses recall that Deputy Collins repeatedly shouted Mr. \n26  Parentiโs name to try to wake him up and either โnudged,โ tapped, or shook him, but Mr. Parenti \n27  did not respond.  See Wolfe Decl. ยถ 12; Griffin Decl. ยถ 11; Rappa Decl. ยถ 11; Rifkin Decl.

Dr. Fithian responded, โOkay. \n3  Iโll come back later.โ Id. 87:23-24.  Deputy Collins testified that it did not occur to him that Mr. \n4  Parenti was experiencing a medical difficulty when he did not wake up for Dr. Fithianโs visit.  Id. \n5  133:9-14.  Moreover, Deputy Collins testified that he did not find blood on Mr. Parentiโs clothing \n6  or the sheets in his bunk, he had not heard of any evidence indicating there had been any such \n7  blood in the preceding 72 hours, and he was not told by any inmate that they had previously seen \n8  Mr. Parenti coughing up blood.  Id. 173:21-174:7.  Mr. Parenti did not cough during the \n9  interaction with Deputy Collins during the sick call rounds.  Id. 173:6-20.   \n10  Other inmates in Mr. Parentiโs housing unit observed that, in the days leading up to his \n11  death, Mr. Parenti was coughing and throwing up blood that was visible on his pillow.  For \n12  example, Antonio Rappa testified that he observed Mr. Parenti throwing up blood in the shower at \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  some point in January 2014. Rappa Decl. ยถ 6.  Griffin testified that on January 12 or 13, 2015, a \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  few days before his death, Mr. Parenti told Griffin that he was coughing up blood and showed \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Griffin blood on his pillow that was thick and mucous-like.  Griffin Decl. ยถ 5.  Wolfe testified that \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  around January 9 or 10, 2014, Mr. Parenti told Wolfe that he was coughing up blood and showed \nS d nr\nee 17  him blood on his pillowcase that looked like it had tissue in it.  Wolfe Decl. ยถยถ 5-7.  Wolfe also \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  testified that after Deputy Collins left the D-wing, at some time between approximately 10:20 and \n19  10:35 A.M., Wolfe walked by Jakeโs bunk and โnoted that he was breathing, but his breath was \n20  shallow.โ Wolfe Decl. ยถ 14. \n21  D.  The โMan Downโ Call \n22  After Deputy Collins finished his medical escort duties with Dr. Fithian, Deputy Collins \n23  left the D-wing and returned to his regular duties as the B&C wing deputy.  Collins Depo. 96:11-\n24  20; 50:5-53:4.  Deputy Collinsโ B&C Wing Deputy station did not provide a sight line for the D \n25  wing because of a partition, so he could not observe Mr. Parenti.  Id. 102:6-14.  According to \n26  Deputy Collins, the control deputy and hallway deputies had the responsibility for monitoring the \n27  D-wing, including Mr. Parenti.  Id. 102:21-103:8; 104:1-13.  \n28  Plaintiffs provide evidence that after Deputy Collins left D-wing, he was with the other \n6 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 109   Filed 04/06/18   Page 7 of 31\n \n1  three deputies in the control tower.  See Rifkin Decl. Volume II, Deposition of James Bass (โBass \n2  Depo.โ) 26:10-27:9; Guerrero Depo. at 32:1-16.  Jail records show that no deputy performed the \n3  hourly health and welfare check for the D-wing around the 10:00 a.m. hour on January 15, 2014.  \n4  Rifkin Decl. Volume I, Exh. 25 at 14; Bass Depo. at 116:2-5; Collins Depo. at 54:20-55:15, \n5  105:13-19.7  Other inmates report that no deputy or jail staff returned to D-wing in the hour \n6  following when Deputy Collins left Mr. Parenti sleeping on his bunk.  See, e.g., Wolfe Decl. ยถ 16.   \n7  At approximately 10:40 a.m., other inmates noticed that Mr. Parenti did not appear to be \n8  breathing and his face had turned a bluish tint.  See Rappa Decl. ยถ 16; Esquivel Decl. ยถ 6; Wolfe \n9  Decl. ยถ 15; Rifkin Decl. Volume I, Exh. 63 at 3.  Several inmates pulled Mr. Parenti down from \n10  his bunk onto the floor and attempted to resuscitate him while other inmates attempted to get the \n11  attention of deputies by banging on the front gate of D-wing and yelling โman down.โ Rappa \n12  Decl. ยถ 17; Esquivel Decl. ยถ 7; Wolfe Decl. ยถ 15; see also Griffin Decl. ยถ 12.  After Deputy \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Collins checked in at Control Tower 5, he saw inmate Packer banging at the D-wing cage, which \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  is typically what the inmates would do if there was some sort of an emergency.  Collins Depo. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  99:12-18.  Deputy Collins estimated that more than half an hour but less than an hour had passed \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  between the time Deputy Collins had been in the D-wing with Dr. Fithian and when he observed \nS d nr\nee 17  the โman downโ call from the control tower.

Deputy Collins and Deputy Gonzalez \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  responded to the D-wing, where they found Mr. Parenti lying on the floor on his back on a \n19  mattress, which could not be seen from the control tower.  Id. 99:25-100:11; Collins Interview \n20  1/15/2014 at 3:2-5.   \n21  Although Deputy Gonzales assessed that Mr. Parenti was breathing, Deputy Collins \n22  testified that he did not see Mr. Parentiโs chest rise and fall so Deputy Collins reassessed and \n23  determined that there was no breathing and no pulse.  Collins Depo. 106:1-107:1.  Deputy Collins \n24  radioed Control 5 and advised them to โcall 911.โ Id. 107:6-13.

In contrast, inmate Rappa attests that an inmate had already \n2  started CPR on Mr. Parenti by the time the deputies arrived, and the deputies did not attempt CPR. \n3  Rappa Decl. ยถ 19.  However, inmate Griffin observed one of the deputies take over CPR when \n4  they arrived.  Griffin Decl. ยถ 13.  Wolfe testified that the deputies only performed chest pumps on \n5  Mr. Parenti, and did not attempt mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.  See Wolfe Decl. ยถ 18.  Griffin \n6  added that it took 5-10 minutes for the guards to arrive and then โseemed to take a long timeโ for \n7  the nurses to come and help Mr. Parenti.  Griffin Decl. ยถยถ 13-14.

Plaintiffsโ Claims Against Deputy Collins  \n25  In relevant part to this motion for partial summary judgment, Plaintiffs allege five causes \n26  of action against Deputy Collins in his individual capacity: (1) failure to provide medical care in \n27  violation of Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments pursuant to 42 USC ยง 1983; (2) deprivation of \n28  substantive due process in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments pursuant to 42 USC \n8 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 109   Filed 04/06/18   Page 9 of 31\n \n1  ยง 1983; (3) failure to furnish/summon medical care; (4) negligence; and (5) wrongful death.8  See \n2  generally Compl., ECF 1.   \n3  II.  LEGAL STANDARD \n4  A.  Summary Judgment \n5  โA party is entitled to summary judgment if the โmovant shows that there is no genuine \n6  dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.โโ  City of \n7  Pomona v. SQM N. Am. Corp., 750 F.3d 1036, 1049 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. \n8  56(a)).  Material facts are those that may affect the outcome of the case.  Anderson v. Liberty \n9  Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  A genuine dispute of material fact exists if there is sufficient \n10  evidence for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.  Id. at 248โ49. \n11  The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the court of \n12  the basis for the motion, and identifying portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  interrogatories, admissions, or affidavits that demonstrate the absence of a triable issue of material \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  fact.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  To meet its burden, โthe moving party \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  must either produce evidence negating an essential element of the nonmoving partyโs claim or \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  defense or show that the nonmoving party does not have enough evidence of an essential element \nS d nr\nee 17  to carry its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial.โ  Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co., Ltd. v. Fritz \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Cos., Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir. 2000). \n19  If the moving party meets its initial burden, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to \n20  produce evidence supporting its claims or defenses.  Id. at 1103.  If the nonmoving party does not \n21  produce evidence to show a genuine issue of material fact, the moving party is entitled to \n22  summary judgment.  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.  It is not the task of the Court to scour the record in \n23  search of a genuine issue of triable fact. Keenan v. Allan, 91 F.3d 1275, 1279 (9th Cir. 1996).  The \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n8 Plaintiffsโ fourth cause of action for negligent supervision, training, hiring and retention is not \nalleged against Deputy Collins.  See Compl. ยถยถ 97-100.  Moreover, Defendants erroneously move \n26 \nfor summary judgment as to the third cause of action under a ยง 1983 framework.  Although the \ncaption of the Complaint mistakenly refers to ยง 1983 next to the third cause of action, the \n27 \nComplaint itself makes clear that the failure to furnish/summon medical care claim is brought \npursuant to California state law, including violations of Cal. Govt. Code ยงยง 844.6 and 845.6.

Navajo Cnty., Ariz., 609 F.3d 1011, 1017 \n3  (9th Cir. 2010).  Thus, โ[t]he district court need not examine the entire file for evidence \n4  establishing a genuine issue of fact, where the evidence is not set forth in the opposing papers with \n5  adequate references so that it could conveniently be found.โ Carmen v. San Francisco Unified \n6  Sch. Dist., 237 F.3d 1026, 1031 (9th Cir. 2001).   \n7  โThe court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and draw \n8  all reasonable inferences in the nonmovantโs favor.โ  City of Pomona, 750 F.3d at 1049.  \n9  However, โthe โmere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiffโs positionโโ is \n10  insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment.  Id. (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. 242, 252 \n11  (1986)).  โโWhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the \n12  nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue for trial.โโ  Id.

Qualified Immunity \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  โThe doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  damages โunless a plaintiff pleads facts showing (1) that the official violated a statutory or \nS d nr\nee 17  constitutional right, and (2) that the right was โclearly establishedโ at the time of the challenged \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  conduct.โโ Wood v. Moss, 134 S.Ct. 2056, 2066โ67 (2014) (quoting Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 131 S.Ct. \n19  2074, 2080 (2011)).  โ[T]he Supreme Court has โrepeatedly ... stressed the importance of resolving \n20  immunity questions at the earliest possible stage in litigation.โโ Dunn v. Castro, 621 F.3d 1196, \n21  1199 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227 (1991)).  Under the applicable \n22  pleading standard, the plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to make out a plausible claim that it \n23  would have been clear to the defendant officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he \n24  confronted. Id. at 2067.  โBecause qualified immunity is an affirmative defense from suit, not \n25  merely from liability, โ[u]nless the plaintiffโs allegations state a claim of violation of clearly \n26  established law, a defendant pleading qualified immunity is entitled to dismissal before the \n27  commencement of discovery.โโ Doe By and Through Doe v. Petaluma City School Dist., 54 F.3d \n28  1447, 1449โ50 (9th Cir. 1995) (quoting Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985)).   \n10 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 109   Filed 04/06/18   Page 11 of 31\n \n1  In Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), the Supreme \n2  Court set forth a two-part approach for analyzing qualified immunity.  The analysis contains both \n3  a constitutional inquiry and an immunity inquiry. Johnson v. County of Los Angeles, 340 F.3d 787, \n4  791 (9th Cir. 2003).  The constitutional inquiry requires the court to determine this threshold \n5  question: โTaken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged \n6  show the officerโs conduct violated a constitutional right?โ Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201.  If the Court \n7  determines that a constitutional violation could be made out based on the partiesโ submissions, the \n8  second step is to determine whether the right was clearly established. Id.  โThe relevant, \n9  dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be \n10  clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.โ Id. at \n11  202.  The Supreme Court has clarified that the sequence of analysis set forth in Saucier is not \n12  mandatory and that a court may exercise its sound discretion in determining which of the two \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  prongs of the qualified immunity analysis to address first.  Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  241-42 (2009).  Thus, in some cases, it may be unnecessary to reach the ultimate constitutional \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  question when officers would be entitled to qualified immunity in any event, a result consistent \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  with longstanding principles of judicial restraint. \nS d nr\nee 17  The Supreme Court recently reiterated the longstanding principle that a โclearly \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  establishedโ constitutional right โshould not be defined โat a high level of generality.โโ White v. \n19  Pauly, 137 S. Ct. 548, 552 (2017) (quoting al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 742).  Rather, it must be \n20  โparticularizedโ to the facts of the case.โId. (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 \n21  (1987)).  Defining the right at too high a level of generality โavoids the crucial question whether \n22  the official acted reasonably in the particular circumstances that he or she faced.โ Plumhoff v. \n23  Ricard, 134 S.Ct. 2012, 2023 (2014).  โ[A] defendant cannot be said to have violated a clearly \n24  established right unless the rightโs contours were sufficiently definite that any reasonable official \n25  in the defendantโs shoes would have understood that he was violating it.โ Id. โIn other words, \n26  โexisting precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional questionโ confronted by the \n27  official โbeyond debate.โโ Id.

DISCUSSION \n6 \nA.  First Cause of Action Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983: Deliberate \nIndifference to an Inmateโs Serious Medical Needs under the Eighth \n7 \nAmendment \n8 \nPlaintiffsโ first cause of action against all Defendants, including Deputy Collins, is a \n9 \nยง 1983 claim for deliberate indifference to Mr. Parentiโs serious medical needs and failure to \n10 \nprotect him from harm in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United \n11 \nStates.  See Compl. ยถยถ 76-86.  Deputy Collins moves for summary judgment on the first cause of \n12 \n \na\ntr in action alleged against him for his alleged deliberate indifference to Mr. Parentiโs serious medical \nuoro 13 \nCfi\n tla needs.  See Mot. at 8-11.  Plaintiffs oppose, arguing that Deputy Collins cannot carry his burden \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo on summary judgment in light of the ample evidence from which a jury can conclude that Deputy \niD tc 15 \n sir\netattsiD 16  Collins was deliberately indifferent.  See Oppโn at 15.  Deputy Collins further asserts that even if \nS d nr there is a triable issue on whether a constitutional violation occurred, he is entitled to qualified \nee 17 \nth\ninUtro immunity under the second prongโthat the right allegedly violated was not โclearly establishedโ \nN 18 \nat the time of Deputy Collinsโ actions on January 15, 2014.  Mot. at 11-15.  Although he need only \n19 \nsucceed on one prong to be shielded from liability, the Court finds that Deputy Collins is entitled \n20 \nto summary judgment under both prongs of qualified immunity.  \n21 \n1.  Constitutional Violation \n22 \nUnder the first prong of qualified immunity, the Court considers whether, taken in the light \n23 \nmost favorable to the party asserting the injury, the facts alleged show the officerโs conduct \n24 \nviolated a constitutional right.  Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201.  Plaintiffs argue that Deputy Collins \n25 \nviolated Mr. Parentiโs Eighth Amendment right to adequate treatment for his serious medical \n26 \nneeds.  Oppโn at 15.  โThe Eighth Amendment protects inmates from cruel and unusual \n27 \npunishment, which includes the denial of medical care.โ Conn v. City of Reno, 591 F.3d 1081, \n28 \n12 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 109   Filed 04/06/18   Page 13 of 31\n \n1  1094 (9th Cir. 2009), vacated, 131 S. Ct. 1812 (2011), reinstated in part and vacated in part, 658 \n2  F.3d 897 (9th Cir. 2011).  โPretrial detainees, by contrast, are protected under the Due Process \n3  Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.โ Id.  โThe Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments both \n4  guarantee that inmates and detainees receive constitutionally adequate medical and mental health \n5  care.โ Conn, 591 F.3d at 1094.  Mr. Parenti was an inmate, rather than a detainee, at the time of \n6  his death on January 15, 2014, and thus the Court conducts the required analysis under the Eighth \n7  Amendment.   \n8  The Supreme Court has emphasized that, โ[j]ust as a prisoner may starve if not fed, he or \n9  she may suffer or die if not provided adequate medical care.  A prison that deprives prisoners of \n10  basic sustenance, including adequate medical care, is incompatible with the concept of human \n11  dignity and has no place in civilized society.โ Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 510โ11 (2011).  To \n12  bring a valid ยง 1983 claim for a violation of Mr. Parentiโs Eighth Amendment rights based on \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  inadequate medical care, Plaintiffs must show that Deputy Collinsโ acts or omissions were \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  โsufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.โ Estelle v. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976); Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 4 (1992); Jett v. Penner, 439 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  F.3d 1091, 1096 (9th Cir. 2006). \nS d nr\nee 17  Deliberate indifference has both an objective and a subjective component in order to rise to \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  an actionable Eighth Amendment violation.  See Clement v. Gomez, 298 F.3d 898, 904 (9th Cir. \n19  2002); see also Labatad v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 714 F.3d 1155, 1160 (9th Cir. 2013).  First, a \n20  plaintiff alleging deliberate indifference must โobjectively show that [the inmate] was deprived of \n21  something โsufficiently serious.โโ Lemire v. California Depโt of Corr. & Rehab., 726 F.3d 1062, \n22  1074 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Foster v. Runnels, 554 F.3d 807, 812 (9th Cir. 2009)).  โA \n23  deprivation is sufficiently serious when the prison officialโs act or omission results โin the denial \n24  of the minimal civilized measure of lifeโs necessities.โโ Id. (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834, 114 \n25  S.Ct. 1970).  Next, the plaintiff must โmake a subjective showing that the deprivation occurred \n26  with deliberate indifference to the inmateโs health or safety.โ Lemire, 726 F.3d at 1074.  To satisfy \n27  the subjective component of deliberate indifference, Plaintiffs must show that Deputy Collins \n28  โknew of and disregardedโ the substantial risk of harm.  Id.  The prison official need not have \n13 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 109   Filed 04/06/18   Page 14 of 31\n \n1  intended harm: โit is enough that the official acted or failed to act despite his knowledge of a \n2  substantial risk of serious harm.โ Id.   \n3  โDeliberate indifference is a high legal standard.โ  Toguchi v. Chung, 391 F.3d 1051, 1060 \n4  (9th Cir. 2004).  A showing of medical malpractice or mere negligence is insufficient to establish a \n5  constitutional deprivation under the Eighth Amendment.  Id.  Rather, deliberate indifference lies \n6  โsomewhere between the poles of negligence at one end and purpose or knowledge at the other.โ \n7  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 836 (1994).  Under the deliberate indifference standard, the \n8  prison official must not only โbe aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a \n9  substantial risk of serious harm exists,โ but that person โmust also draw the inference.โ Id. \n10  (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837).  Liability may follow only if a prison official โknows that \n11  inmates face a substantial risk of serious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable \n12  measures to abate it.โ Labatad, 714 F.3d at 1160 (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 847); see \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  also Hallett v. Morgan, 296 F.3d 732, 744 (9th Cir. 2002) (โDeliberate indifference may be \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  reflected through either action or inaction such as denial, delay, or intentional interference with \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  medical treatment.โ). \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  The Supreme Court has explained that it is โfair to say that acting or failing to act with \nS d nr\nee 17  deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to a prisoner is the equivalent of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  recklessly disregarding that risk.โ Farmer, 511 U.S. at 836.  โIf a [prison official] should have \n19  been aware of the risk, but was not, then the [official] has not violated the Eighth Amendment, no \n20  matter how severe the risk.โ Id. (quoting Gibson v. Cty. of Washoe, Nev., 290 F.3d 1175, 1187 \n21  (9th Cir. 2002), overruled on other grounds by Castro v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 833 F.3d 1060 (9th \n22  Cir. 2016)).  Finally, Plaintiffs must also demonstrate that Deputy Collinsโ actions were both an \n23  actual and proximate cause of Mr. Parentiโs injuries.  See Conn, 591 F.3d at 1098โ1101; see also \n24  Clouthier v. County of Contra Costa, 591 F.3d 1232, 1245 n.3 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing White v. \n25  Roper, 901 F.2d 1501, 1505 (9th Cir. 1990)). \n26  Unsurprisingly, the parties have diametrically opposed views of what happened in the D-\n27  wing at the Monterey County Jailโs Rehabilitation Unit on January 15, 2014.  Defendants describe \n28  the events as a routine, non-emergency โsick callโ to inmates who had requested or been referred \n14 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 109   Filed 04/06/18   Page 15 of 31\n \n1  to the doctor, and a decision by a 28-year veteran deputy to let Mr. Parenti continue sleeping when \n2  he was found snoring in his bed.  Plaintiffsโ view of the facts is that Mr. Parenti was unresponsive \n3  when Deputy Collins tried to rouse him, and Deputy Collins violated protocol and callously left a \n4  helpless man to die in his jail bed, which amounts to deliberate indifference.  On summary \n5  judgment, even under the qualified immunity analysis, the Court must believe Plaintiffsโ evidence, \n6  and draw all reasonable inferences in their favor.  Plaintiffsโ โversion of any disputed issue of fact \n7  is thus presumed correct.โ Thomas v. Ponder, 611 F.3d 1144, 1149 (9th Cir. 2010).  The question \n8  before the Court on summary judgment is whether a genuine issue of material fact exists such \n9  there is a triable issue on whether Deputy Collins was deliberately indifferent to Mr. Parentiโs \n10  serious medical needs.9  Id.   \n11  Plaintiffs acknowledge that the โkey issueโ in this case is whether Deputy Collins had \n12  knowledge of Mr. Parentiโs serious medical need on the morning of January 15, 2014, and his \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  obligation to respond to that need.  See Oppโn at 15-16.  This is the subjective element of \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  deliberate indifference, which requires a plaintiff to show that Deputy Collins โknew of and \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  disregardedโ the substantial risk of harm to Mr. Parenti.  Lemire, 726 F.3d at 1074.  Deputy \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Collins argues that there can be no ยง 1983 liability for deliberate indifference because there is no \nS d nr\nee 17  evidence that he had knowledge of an acute medical need of Mr. Parenti at the time of the โsick \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  callโ rounds with Dr. Fithian.  Mot. at 10-11.  Rather, Deputy Collins argues that it is undisputed \n19  that he had no medical information about Mr. Parenti, so when Mr. Parenti failed to respond after \n20  his name was called for a routine โsick call,โ Deputy Collinsโ decision to let him sleepโafter he \n21  grumbled when Deputy Collins tapped his shoulder several timesโwas not deliberate indifference \n22  to a serious medical need.  Id.   \n23  The Court agrees that Deputy Collins ignores a number of disputed facts in the record.  For \n24  example, in contrast to Deputy Collinsโ testimony that he did not know that Mr. Parenti had any \n25  medical issues, in his interview shortly after Mr. Parentiโs death on January 15, 2014, Deputy \n26  Collins recalled that Mr. Parenti had a medical problem and would go to sick call a lot.  See \n27 \n                                                 \n9 As discussed below, even if a triable issue exists on the constitutional violation, Deputy Collins \n28 \nmay still be entitled to qualified immunity if the constitutional right was not clearly established. \n15 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 109   Filed 04/06/18   Page 16 of 31\n \n1  Collins Interview 1/15/2014 at 7:3-20.  The four inmate witnesses also provide sworn affidavits \n2  that instead of just โtappingโ Mr. Parenti on the shoulder, Deputy Collins actually shook Mr. \n3  Parenti and called his name loudly, but Mr. Parenti โdid not respond.โ  Rappa Decl. ยถ 11; Esquivel \n4  Decl. ยถ 4; Griffin Decl. ยถยถ 10-11; Wolfe Decl. ยถ 12.10   \n5  Although the Court considers these factual disputes and does not credit Deputy Collinsโ \n6  version of the facts at summary judgment, Plaintiffs have not shown that the evidence they \n7  provide supports facts material to the subjective component of deliberate indifference.  There is \n8  simply no evidence in the record that Deputy Collins was subjectively aware of facts from which \n9  the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm to Mr. Parenti existed, or that \n10  Deputy Collins actually drew the inference that such a risk existed.  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837.  As \n11  laid out in the factual background above, the Court credits Plaintiffsโ evidence that Deputy Collins \n12  called Mr. Parenti during the morning rounds for a sick call that Mr. Parenti had requested.  There \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  is evidence from several inmates that Mr. Parenti was laying unresponsive on his bunk and did not \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  wake up even when Deputy Collins repeatedly called his name loudly from right next to him and \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  shook him.  See Wolfe Decl. ยถ 12; Griffin Decl. ยถ 11; Rappa Decl. ยถ 11; Esquivel Decl. ยถ 4.  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  However, it is undisputed that Mr. Parenti was breathing during Deputy Collinsโ interaction with \nS d nr\nee 17  him, and the inmate witnesses do not dispute Deputy Collinsโ recollection that Mr. Parenti was \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  snoring.  See Rifkin Decl. Volume I, Transcript of February 4, 2014 Interview of Deputy Collins \n19  (โCollins Interview 2/4/2014โ), Exh. 208 at 9:4-6.  It is also undisputed that Mr. Parenti had been \n20  awake a few hours earlier that morning, when he had breakfast in the D-wing.  Wolfe Decl. ยถ 9.   \n21  When Mr. Parenti did not respond to being called and shaken multiple times, Plaintiffs \n22  point to evidence that Deputy Collins left Mr. Parenti in his bunk and did not report his \n23  unresponsiveness to medical personnel or to his supervisors.  In fact, Plaintiffs attempt to dispute \n24 \n                                                 \n25 \n10 The Court notes that three of the inmate witnesses also testified that Mr. Parenti showed them \nblood on his pillow or they observed Mr. Parenti coughing up blood in the days prior to his death.  \n26 \nHowever, none of the witnesses testifies that there was blood on Mr. Parentiโs pillow or that he \ncoughed up blood on the morning in question during his interaction with Deputy Collins.  See, \n27 \ne.g., Rappa Decl. ยถ 6; Griffin Decl. ยถ 5; Wolfe Decl. ยถ 7.  Accordingly, the Court cannot draw a \nreasonable inference from this evidence that there was blood in the bunk on the morning of \n28 \nJanuary 15, 2014 such that it would have been sufficiently obvious to Deputy Collins.  \n16 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 109   Filed 04/06/18   Page 17 of 31\n \n1  Deputy Collinsโ testimony at his deposition in May 2016, when Deputy Collins โrememberedโ not \n2  only that Mr. Parenti โgrumbledโ something in response to his tapping (as opposed to just snoring, \n3  as previously reported), but also that Deputy Collins told Dr. Fithian that Mr. Parenti was \n4  โsleeping pretty good,โ and Dr. Fithian responded โokay, Iโll come back later.โ Collins Depo. \n5  87:7-24.  The Court accepts the testimony of the inmate witnesses that Mr. Parenti โdid not \n6  respond,โ to Deputy Collins that morning, and therefore Deputy Collinsโ testimony that Mr. \n7  Parenti โgrumbledโ a response is disputed.  However, the Court finds that Deputy Collinsโ \n8  testimony that he told Dr. Fithian that Mr. Parenti was โsleeping pretty good,โ is undisputed.   \n9  Dr. Fithian himself does not remember anything about what happened on the morning in \n10  question, and does not recall โanything that Deputy Collins said about Jacob Parenti on the \n11  morning of January 15, 2014.โ  Fithian Depo. at 25:15-26:9.   Plaintiffs argue that Deputy Collinsโ \n12  account of the events surrounding Mr. Parentiโs death changed over time from his initial \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  interviews with investigators in January and February 2014, through his deposition on May 12, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  2016, and again in his declaration signed September 29, 2017.  Plaintiffs argue that a triable issue \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  of fact exists because Deputy Collins did not initially report to investigators that he made any \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  comment to Dr. Fithian when Mr. Parenti did not get up for sick call.  See Collins Interview \nS de nre 17  1/15/14 at 8:14-25.11   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  After the hearing on Deputy Collinsโ motion for summary judgment, the Court ordered \n19  supplemental briefing on whether the discrepancies in Deputy Collinsโ recollection of events over \n20  the years constitutes evidence of disputed facts that the Court must consider on summary \n21  judgment.  Plaintiffs argue that Deputy Collinsโ omission of his comment to Dr. Fithian in his \n22  2014 interviews is materially inconsistent with Deputy Collinsโ deposition testimony and \n23                                                   \n11 Plaintiffs mischaracterize the interview transcript in their opposition, stating that Deputy Collins \n24 \nโreportedโ to Nurse Maureen that Mr. Parenti changed his mind about going to sick call.  See \nOppโn at 5 (citing Collins Interview 1/15/14 at 9:3-8).  Rather, this portion of the interview \n25 \ntranscript is in response to the investigatorโs question: โ[W]ho does [Mr. Parenti] report that to if \n26  heโs not going to go [to sick call]?โ to which Deputy Collins responded: โTo the nurse. To the \nnurse thatโs doing sick call. And I think this morning it was Nurse Maureen.โ Collins Interview \n27  1/15/14 at 9:3-6.  Thus, this portion of the interview discussed who Mr. Parenti would have \nreported to if he did not want to go to sick call, and says nothing about what was actually reported \n28 \nto medical staff on the day in question.   \n17 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 109   Filed 04/06/18   Page 18 of 31\n \n1  declaration years later.  See Plaintiffsโ Supplemental Brief at 2, ECF 105.  Plaintiffs urge the Court \n2  to consider these omissions as prior inconsistent statements that raise a factual issue precluding \n3  summary judgment.  Id.  The Court is not persuaded, because Deputy Collinsโ deposition \n4  testimony is not โinternally inconsistentโ with his earlier reports to investigators.  Plaintiffs point \n5  to no questions or responses from those interviews where an investigator elicited information from \n6  Deputy Collins regarding what he said to Dr. Fithian.  It is not enough that Deputy Collins did not \n7  volunteer such information in the earlier interviews.   \n8  Even accepting Deputy Collinsโ first two interviews with investigators as true, no \n9  reasonable jury could find a contradiction between Deputy Collinsโ interview responses and his \n10  later testimony that he told Dr. Fithian that Mr. Parenti was โsleeping pretty good,โ after he was \n11  unable to rouse Mr. Parenti.  Accordingly, there is no genuine factual dispute on this point.  \n12  Plaintiffs impermissibly ask the Court to make a credibility determination at summary judgment.  \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 2513, 91 L.

Bell, 547 U.S. 518, 559โ60, \nS d nr\nee 17  126 S. Ct. 2064, 2089, 165 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2006) (โ[T]he district court does not assess credibility or \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  weigh the evidence, but simply determines whether there is a genuine factual issue for trial.โ)  In \n19  any event, the Court finds that this factual dispute is immaterial to the issue at hand.  Even if \n20  Deputy Collins never told Dr. Fithian that Mr. Parenti was asleep, it does not create a triable issue \n21  on deliberate indifference, because there is no evidence that Deputy Collins had knowledge of a \n22  risk of harm to Mr. Parenti.   \n23  Deputy Collins also testified that he was trained in responding to medical issues in jails, \n24  including identifying a potential overdose or medical emergency.  See Collins Depo. at 62:19-\n25  65:20, 71:3-72:11.  Yet there is no evidence that Deputy Collins was aware of an overdose or a \n26  medical emergency when he interacted with Mr. Parenti on January 15, 2014.  On the day of Mr. \n27  Parentiโs death, however, Deputy Collins was aware that two inmates in the D-wing of the jail had \n28  overdosed in January 2014 alone, and that Mr. Parenti was a โcasual drug userโ based on the \n18 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 109   Filed 04/06/18   Page 19 of 31\n \n1  charges he was in jail for.  Id. Collins Dep. at 80:3-14, 81:11-24, 82:19-25.  Yet Plaintiffs also \n2  submit evidence from their independent autopsy and toxicology specialist concluding that Mr. \n3  Parentiโs death was not the result of having any drugs in his system.  See Exh. 210 at 4.  It is not \n4  reasonable to infer from Plaintiffsโ evidence that deputies had the obligation to wake up every \n5  sleeping inmate to ensure he is not sick or suffering from an overdose.  Deputy Collinsโ \n6  knowledge of this general information in the D-Wing is immaterial to his awareness of a serious \n7  risk to Mr. Parentiโs medical needs that morning.  The Court finds that there is no evidence that \n8  Deputy Collins would have had a heightened awareness that Parenti was on drugs or was suffering \n9  from a medical emergency when he did not wake up for a psychiatric sick call.   \n10  Plaintiffs also point to the testimony of Captain Bass, Defendantsโ Rule 30(b)(6) witness, \n11  who stated that when an officer finds an inmate who may be unconscious, the officer is trained to \n12  secure the scene, call for more advanced medical personnel, and check for signs of life.  Bass \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Depo. 48:14-49:12.  According to Captain Bass, the first step in checking for signs of life is \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  โ[t]rying to arouse them.โ Id. 49:7-12.   However, there is no evidence in the record that Mr. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Parenti was unconscious at the time Deputy Collins approached his bunkโor more importantly, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  that Deputy Collins had awareness that he was unconsciousโonly that Mr. Parenti was sleeping, \nS d nr\nee 17  snoring, and unresponsive to several attempts to wake him.   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Even drawing all reasonable inferences from these facts in Plaintiffsโ favor, there is no \n19  genuine dispute of material fact on the constitutional question of whether Deputy Collins was \n20  deliberately indifferent to Mr. Parentiโs serious medical need.  No reasonable jury could find that \n21  Deputy Collins acted with deliberate indifference by denying, delaying, and interfering with Mr. \n22  Parentiโs medical treatment because there is no evidence upon which a jury could conclude that \n23  Deputy Collins was subjectively aware of a substantial risk to harm to Mr. Parenti and recklessly \n24  disregarded that risk.12  Clement v. Gomez is instructive on the kind of evidence sufficient to send \n25 \n                                                 \n26  12 Plaintiffs urge this Court to consider the decision in Frary v. Cty. of Marin, where the court \nfound that triable issues existed based on similar factual circumstances.  81 F. Supp. 3d 811, 830 \n27  (N.D. Cal. 2015).  In Frary, Deputy Hammer attempted to rouse an unresponsive, snoring inmate, \nand moved on without reporting his unresponsiveness despite several attempts to wake him. Id.at \n28 \n829.  The court concluded that a genuine dispute of material fact existed as to whether Deputy \n19 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 109   Filed 04/06/18   Page 20 of 31\n \n1  the question of deliberate indifference to the jury.  298 F.3d 898, 904 (9th Cir. 2002).  As \n2  discussed in detail below under the second prong of qualified immunity, Clement involved jail \n3  deputies who experienced the ill-effects of pepper sprayโwhich was evidenced by the deputies \n4  taking turns stepping outside for fresh air, and coughing and gagging in the hallโand yet those \n5  deputies denied showers and medical attention to the inmates who the deputies knew had also \n6  been exposed to the pepper sprayโs harmful effects.  Id. at 905.  The Ninth Circuit concluded that \n7  such evidence was sufficient for the prisoners to survive summary judgment on the issue of \n8  whether the deputies were subjectively aware of the risk of serious injury to the prisoners.  Id.  In \n9  contrast, evidence of Deputy Collinsโ awareness of Mr. Parentiโs condition is entirely lacking from \n10  this case.   \n11  For the foregoing reasons and drawing all inferences from the evidentiary record in favor \n12  of Plaintiffs, the Court finds that Deputy Collins is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffsโ \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  first cause of action because there is no triable issue on whether Deputy Collins was deliberately \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  indifferent to Mr. Parentiโs serious medical needs on the morning of January 15, 2014.  Moreover, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  even if a triable issue on the constitutional question existed, Deputy Collins is shielded under the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  second prong of qualified immunity.  See White v. Pauly, 137 S. Ct. 548, 551 (2017). \nS d nr\nee 17  2.  Clearly Established \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Qualified immunity also protects government officials from liability for civil damages \n19  insofar as their conduct โdoes not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of \n20  which a reasonable person would have known.โ  White v. Pauly, 137 S. Ct. at 551 (2017).  \n21  โBecause the focus is on whether the officer had fair notice that her conduct was unlawful, \n22  reasonableness is judged against the backdrop of the law at the time of the conduct.โ Brosseau v. \n23                                                                                                                                                                  \nHammer acted with deliberate indifference to the inmateโs serious medical needs.  Id. at 830.  As \n24 \nexplained at the hearing, Frary is not controlling law and it is also distinguishable because there \nwas evidence that a trustee nearby commented to Deputy Hammer that the inmate โlooks dead.โ \n25 \nId. at 829.  Here, there is no evidence that any inmate made a comment to Deputy Collins that \n26  would permit the Court to infer his awareness of a substantial risk of harm.  In fact, when Deputy \nCollins asked the other inmates if Mr. Parenti โalways slept like that,โ the response was โwe donโt \n27  know,โ and Deputy Collins said โwell heโs going to miss sick call.โ Rappa ยถยถ 12-14.  Based on the \nundisputed facts in the record, no reasonable jury could find that Deputy Collins knew of and \n28 \ndisregarded an excessive risk to Mr. Parentiโs safety.   \n20 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 109   Filed 04/06/18   Page 21 of 31\n \n1  Haugen, 543 U.S. 194, 198 (2004).  โThe relevant, dispositive inquiry in determining whether a \n2  right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was \n3  unlawful in the situation he confronted.โ Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202.  Although the Supreme Court \n4  โdoes not require a case directly on point for a right to be clearly established, existing precedent \n5  must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.โ White, 137 S.Ct., at 551 \n6  (internal quotation marks omitted).  โIn other words, immunity protects all but the plainly \n7  incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.โ Id.  \n8  The Supreme Court has consistently told lower courts, and the Ninth Circuit in particular, \n9  that clearly established law should not be defined at a high level of generality.  See Kisela v. \n10  Hughes, No. 17-467, 2018 WL 1568126, at *2 (U.S. Apr. 2, 2018) (quoting City and County of \n11  San Francisco v. Sheehan, 135 S.Ct. 1765, 1775โ1776 (2015)); see also White v. Pauly, 137 S. Ct. \n12  at 552 (quoting al-Kidd, 563 U.S. at 742).  Rather, clearly established law must be โparticularizedโ \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  to the facts of the case, otherwise the analysis โavoids the crucial question whether the official \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  acted reasonably in the particular circumstances that he or she faced.โ Plumhoff v. Ricard, 134 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  S.Ct. 2012, 2023 (2014).  An officer โcannot be said to have violated a clearly established right \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  unless the rightโs contours were sufficiently definite that any reasonable official in the defendantโs \nS d nr\nee 17  shoes would have understood that he was violating it.โ Id.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Further, the Ninth Circuit is unequivocal that the burden is on the plaintiff to point to case \n19  law indicating that the right allegedly violated was clearly established.  โExcept in the rare case of \n20  an โobviousโ instance of constitutional misconductโฆPlaintiffs must identify a case where an \n21  officer acting under similar circumstances as [Officer Pfiefer] was held to have violated the Fourth \n22  Amendment.โ Sharp v. County of Orange, No. 15-56146, 2017 WL 4126947, at *7 (9th Cir. Sept. \n23  19, 2017) (emphasis in original) (quoting White, 137 S.Ct. at 552).  The preexisting law identified \n24  must also be โcontrollingโfrom the Ninth Circuit or Supreme Courtโor otherwise be embraced \n25  by a consensus of courts outside the relevant jurisdiction.โ Id.  \n26  As applied to this case, Deputy Collins argues that even if a triable issue exists as to a \n27  constitutional violation, qualified immunity shields him from liability if a deputy in his shoes \n28  could have reasonably believed his actions were legal in light of clearly established law and the \n21 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 109   Filed 04/06/18   Page 22 of 31\n \n1  information he possessed at the time.  See Mot. at 12.  Even if a constitutional violation occurred, \n2  Plaintiffs have the burden to show that every reasonable officer would have known that Deputy \n3  Collinsโ conduct was unconstitutional under the circumstances.  Thompson v. Rahr, 885 F.3d 582 \n4  (9th Cir. 2018).  Even construing all evidence in favor of Plaintiffs, they have not carried their \n5  burden to show that the law was โclearly establishedโ such that Deputy Collins had fair warning \n6  that his conduct was unconstitutional within the Supreme Courtโs parameters for qualified \n7  immunity.    \n8  โAlthough we must view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, \n9  when considering qualified immunity, we are also limited to considering what facts the officer \n10  could have known at the time of the incident.โ Davis v. United States, 854 F.3d 594, 598 (9th Cir. \n11  2017) (citing White, 137 S.Ct. at 550).  Ultimately, the Court asks โwhether [Deputy Collins] \n12  would be entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law, assuming all factual disputes are \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  resolved, and all reasonable inferences are drawn, in plaintiffโs favor.โ  Estate of Lopez by & \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  through Lopez v. Gelhaus, 871 F.3d 998, 1006 (9th Cir. 2017) (internal citation and quotation \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  omitted).  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  As before, the Court resolves all factual disputes in favor of Plaintiffs.  The Court therefore \nS d nr\nee 17  does not credit Deputy Collinsโ disputed testimony that Mr. Parenti โgrumbledโ a response to him \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  that Collins interpreted as a refusal to attend sick call.  Rather, the Court accepts Plaintiffsโ \n19  evidence that Mr. Parenti did not respond when Deputy Collins walked over to Mr. Parentiโs bunk \n20  and loudly called his name and shook him.  At that moment in time, Deputy Collins was aware \n21  that Mr. Parenti had a history of drug use and medical problems and was often on the sick call list.  \n22  Deputy Collins was further aware that two inmates in the same housing unit as Mr. Parenti had \n23  overdosed on drugs only a few days prior.  Deputy Collins was also trained on how to respond to \n24  overdoses and emergencies.  Yet after being unable to rouse Mr. Parenti, Deputy Collins did not \n25  alert any medical staff or supervisors to the fact that Mr. Parenti was unresponsive, and did not \n26  return to check on Mr. Parenti until he saw the โman downโ call nearly an hour later.   \n27  With these facts in mind, Plaintiffs frame the qualified immunity analysis as follows: \n28  โwhether, as of January 2014, the law was clearly established that a custody officer could not be \n22 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 109   Filed 04/06/18   Page 23 of 31\n \n1  deliberately indifferent to an inmate in serious medical need and whether a reasonable officer \n2  would have known that it was a violation of this legal obligation to leave an inmate who was not \n3  responsive without summoning any medical provider, providing emergency response, or even \n4  coming back to check on the inmate within a short time period.โ  Oppโn at 19.  The Court finds \n5  that Plaintiffs have cast the constitutional right at too high a level of generality.  It is not enough \n6  that the law โclearly establishesโ that prisoners have the right to adequate medical treatment.  \n7  Rather, it must be clearly established as of January 15, 2014, that a deputy could not leave a \n8  sleeping inmate with a history of drug use and medical problems who did not respond to being \n9  called and shaken for a non-emergency visit with a psychiatrist, without fully waking the inmate \n10  or notifying medical personnel or supervisors that the inmate was unresponsive.   \n11  Plaintiffs also incorrectly place the burden on Deputy Collins to cite to a case \n12  demonstrating that the right was not clearly established and that officers were not sufficiently on \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  notice of their legal obligation to provide care to an unresponsive inmate.  Oppโn at 19.  The Ninth \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Circuit has made clear that the burden is on Plaintiffs.  Sharp, 871 F.3d at 911 (โPlaintiffs must \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  point to prior case law that articulates a constitutional rule specific enough to alert these deputies \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  in this case that their particular conduct was unlawful.โ) (emphasis in original); see also \nS d nr\nee 17  Clairmont v. Sound Mental Health, 632 F.3d 1091, 1109 (9th Cir. 2011) (โThe plaintiff bears the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  burden to show that the contours of the right were clearly established.โ) \n19  The Court has considered the cases offered by Plaintiffs to define the clearly established \n20  right, and finds that they have not met their burden.  Plaintiffs cite to Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. \n21  97, 104-05 (1976), Clement v. Gomez, 298 F.3d 898, 906 (9th Cir. 2002), and Estate of Prasad ex \n22  rel. Prasad v. Cty. of Sutter, 958 F. Supp. 2d 1101, 1112-1113 (E.D. Cal. 2013).  See Oppโn at 20.  \n23  Plaintiffs also rely on Frary v. Cty. of Marin, 81 F. Supp. 3d 811, 828 (N.D. Cal. 2015). Oppโn at \n24  20.  However, Frary itself cannot clearly establish anything in this case, because it is not \n25  controlling precedent and it was decided after the events at issue took place on January 15, 2014.13   \n26  In Estelle, the plaintiff was an inmate in the Texas Department of Corrections who was \n27 \n                                                 \n13 To the extent that Frary holds that Clement clearly establishes the right at issue, this Court \n28 \nconducts its own analysis of Clement in light of Supreme Court guidance on qualified immunity. \n23 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 109   Filed 04/06/18   Page 24 of 31\n \n1  injured when a bale of cotton fell on him while he was performing a prison work assignment to \n2  unload a truck. 429 U.S. at 99.  He continued to work, but later sought medical treatment for back \n3  pain.  Id. at 99-100.  Jail staff ultimately concluded that plaintiff was able to work, and plaintiff \n4  was repeatedly disciplined for his refusal to work due to his injuries.  Id.  The Supreme Court held \n5  that even applying liberal standards for pro se litigants, the plaintiffโs claims against the treating \n6  physician are not cognizable under section 1983.  Id. at 107.  The facts of Estelle are not at all \n7  โparticularizedโ to the facts of this case such that they would put a reasonable officer in Deputy \n8  Collinsโ position that his conduct was unconstitutional.  Rather, Estelle marks the Supreme \n9  Courtโs general conclusion that โdeliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisonersโ is \n10  proscribed by the Eighth Amendment. Id. at 104.   \n11  Clement is similarly general, and does not clearly establish that Deputy Collinsโ conduct in \n12  this case was unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment.  In Clement, a violent fight erupted \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  inside a prison cell, and the responding correctional officers administered several bursts of pepper \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  spray when the inmates failed to respond to several orders and attempts to break up the fight. 298 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  F.3d 898, 901 (9th Cir. 2002).  Inmates in neighboring cells claimed that the spray vapors drifted \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  into their cells, injuring them.  Id.  Those inmates alleged that the officials were deliberately \nS d nr\nee 17  indifferent to their serious medical needs because they โwere aware of the harmful effects of the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  pepper spray and of the inadequacy of their ventilation methods and yet purposefully refused to \n19  provide showers, medical care, or combative instructions or to develop an adequate policy to \n20  address obvious risks.โ Id. at 904.   \n21  The Ninth Circuit in Clement affirmed the district courtโs denial of summary judgment \n22  based on the officialsโ assertion of qualified immunity.  Id.  In examining the second prong of \n23  qualified immunity, the Clement court noted that โ[t]he general law regarding the medical \n24  treatment of prisoners was clearly established at the time of the incident.โ  Id. at 906 \n25  (citing Hamilton v. Endell, 981 F.2d 1062, 1066 (9th Cir. 1992).  The Ninth Circuit also relied on \n26  Estelle to find that it was also clearly established that the officers could not intentionally deny or \n27 \n28 \n24 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 109   Filed 04/06/18   Page 25 of 31\n \n1  delay access to medical care. Id.14   \n2  The Court finds that Estelle and Clement are cast at too high a level of generality for the \n3  required qualified immunity analysis, and these cases do not put the constitutional question \n4  confronting Deputy Collins on January 15, 2014 โbeyond debate.โ  See White, 137 S.Ct. at 551.  \n5  Importantly, in both cases, the defendants denied requested medical care for medical conditions \n6  they were aware of.  Although โgeneral statements of the law are not inherently incapable of \n7  giving fair and clear warning to officers,โ id. at 552, the general law that prisoners have the right \n8  to adequate medical treatment and that an officerโs denial or delay in provision of that medical \n9  treatment violates the Eighth Amendment, does not amount to clearly established law in this \n10  case.15   \n11  At most, Clement clearly establishes that where officers know that pepper spray harmed \n12  inmates in neighboring cells who were bystanders to a fight, based on the officers own experience \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  with the harmful effects of pepper spray, those officers are deliberately indifferent to serious \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  medical needs by denying the inmates showers and access to medical care following the incident.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  298 F.3d 898, 906 (9th Cir. 2002).  Clement would not have alerted a reasonable official in Deputy \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Collinsโ position on January 15, 2014, that it would be unlawful to leave a sleeping inmate with a \nS d nr\nee 17  history of drug use and medical problems who did not respond to being called and shaken for a \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18 \n                                                 \n14 The third case cited by Plaintiffs, Prasad, is not controlling Ninth Circuit or Supreme Court \n19 \nauthority and thus the Court need not consider it.  Sharp, 2017 WL 4126947, at *7.  Moreover, \nPlaintiffs do not demonstrate that Prasad forms a โconsensusโ with other court decisions \n20 \namounting to clearly established preexisting law. Id.  Regardless, Prasad is too factually \ndissimilar because it dealt with a pretrial detainee who was taken to see a doctor for emergency \n21 \ntreatment, who discharged him with specific instructions to be returned to the emergency \ndepartment if his symptoms worsened or new symptoms developed.  958 F. Supp. 2d at 1113.  The \n22 \ndefendant deputies were aware of this order and observed Prasadโs condition worsen and develop, \nbut did not return him to the emergency room.  Id.  The District Court for the Eastern District of \n23 \nCalifornia held that this amounted to deliberate indifference to Prasadโs serious medical needs. Id.  \nEven if Prasad represented controlling law, a reasonable deputy in Deputy Collinsโ position \n24 \nwould not be on notice that letting Mr. Parenti sleep in a non-emergency situation violated clearly \nestablished law.  See Ford v. City of Yakima, 706 F.3d at 1195 (โThe relevant inquiry is whether, \n25 \nat the time of the officersโ action, the state of the law gave the officers fair warning that their \nconduct was unconstitutional.โ)  \n26 \n15 Plaintiffs also argue, without citing to any authority, that the County of Montereyโs own policies \nand training put Deputy Collins on notice of his obligations to call for advanced medical personnel \n27 \nand trying to rouse Mr. Parenti in the situation he confronted.  Oppโn at 20.  The Court is unaware \nof any authority suggesting jail policies and procedures alone can amount to a clearly established \n28 \nstatutory or constitutional right.   \n25 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 109   Filed 04/06/18   Page 26 of 31\n \n1  non-emergency visit with a psychiatrist, without fully waking the inmate or notifying medical \n2  personnel or supervisors that the inmate was unresponsive.  The Supreme Courtโs guidance in the \n3  years since Estelle and Clement has consistently told lower courts that they cannot define clearly \n4  established law at a high level of generality, and must evaluate the law under the particularized \n5  circumstances of the case.  See Kisela, 2018 WL 1568126, at *2 (quoting Sheehan, 135 S.Ct. at \n6  1775โ1776).   \n7  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden that the law was \n8  clearly established on January 15, 2014.  Accordingly, Deputy Collins is shielded by qualified \n9  immunity and his motion for partial summary judgment on the first cause of action is GRANTED.  \n10 \nB.  Second Cause of Action Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983: Deprivation of \nSubstantive Due Process Rights to Familial Association under the Fourteenth \n11 \nAmendment \n  12  Deputy Collins also moves for summary judgment on Plaintiffsโ second ยง 1983 cause of \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  action for a violation of substantive due process.  โThe substantive due process right to family \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  integrity or to familial association is well established.โ Rosenbaum v. Washoe Cnty., 663 F.3d \nrts fo\niD tc 15  1071, 1079 (9th Cir. 2011).  โA parent has a fundamental liberty interest in companionship with \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  his or her child.โ Kelson v. City of Springfield, 767 F.2d 651, 654โ55 (9th Cir.1985).  The \nS d nr\nee 17  violation of the right to family integrity is subject to remedy under ยง 1983. Id.  โParents and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  children may assert Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claims if they are deprived of \n19  their liberty interest in the companionship and society of their child or parent through official \n20  conduct.โ Lemire v. California Dep't of Corr. & Rehab., 726 F.3d 1062, 1075 (9th Cir. 2013).  To \n21  amount to a violation of substantive due process, however, the harmful conduct must โshock the \n22  conscienceโ or โoffend the communityโs sense of fair play and decency.โ Rosenbaum, 663 F.3d at \n23  1079.   \n24  โJust as the deliberate indifference of prison officials to the medical needs of prisoners may \n25  support Eighth Amendment liability, such indifference may also rise to the conscience-shocking \n26  level required for a substantive due process violation.โ Lemire, 726 F.3d at 1075 (internal citation \n27  and quotations omitted).  The Ninth Circuit held in Lemire that โ[a] prison officialโs deliberately \n28  indifferent conduct will generally โshock the conscienceโ so as long as the prison official had time \n26 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 109   Filed 04/06/18   Page 27 of 31\n \n1  to deliberate before acting or failing to act in a deliberately indifferent manner.โ Id. (citing \n2  Tennison v.

See Oppโn at 22.  As explained above regarding Deputy Collinsโ \n6  entitlement to qualified immunity on the Eighth Amendment violation, the Court finds that \n7  summary judgment is also appropriate on Plaintiffsโ second cause of action for a substantive due \n8  process violation.  There are no genuine issues of material fact as to whether Deputy Collins acted \n9  with deliberate indifference and thereby deprived Plaintiffs Susan Parenti and D.P-O. of their \n10  relationship with Mr. Parenti.  Accordingly, no reasonable jury could conclude based on the \n11  evidence in the record that Deputy Collinsโ conduct โshocked the conscience.โ Lemire, 726 F.3d at \n12  1075.   \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Deputy Collinsโ motion for partial summary judgment on Plaintiffsโ ยง 1983 claim for loss \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  of familial association is GRANTED. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  C.

Instead, Deputy Collins only vaguely identifies the failure to furnish/summon \n5  medical care cause of action by erroneously grouping it with Plaintiffsโ ยง 1983 causes of action \n6  without explanation.  Mot. at 8 (โPlaintiffsโ first three causes of action against Collins are \n7  analyzed under a deliberate indifference standard.โ)  Deputy Collins also does not properly \n8  address the claim in his discussion of the state law causes of action, or in his reply after Plaintiffs \n9  raised this issue in their opposition.  See Oppโn at 22 n.9; Reply at 3.   \n10  To the extent Deputy Collins moves for partial summary judgment on Plaintiffsโ third \n11  cause of action for failure to furnish/summon medical care pursuant to California Government \n12  Code ยง 845.6, the motion is DENIED. The Court also finds that summary judgment is \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  inappropriate on the third cause of action for the reasons discussed below regarding the state law \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  causes of action.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  D.

Supp. 2d 1101, 1118 (E.D. Cal. 2013). \n6  Deputy Collins argues that he is entitled to statutory immunity on the negligence and \n7  wrongful death claims under the immunity provided by California Government Code section \n8  845.6.  Mot. at 15; Reply at 8.  That section provides in part that โ[n]either a public entity nor a \n9  public employee is liable for injury proximately caused by the failure of the employee to furnish or \n10  obtain medical care for a prisoner in his custody.โ Cal. Govโt Code ยง 845.6 (West).  An exception \n11  exists โif the employee knows or has reason to know that the prisoner is in need of immediate \n12  medical care and he fails to take reasonable action to summon such medical care.โ Id.   \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  โLiability of public entities and public employees under Government Code section 845.6 is \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  limited to serious and obvious medical conditions requiring immediate care.โ  Lucas v.

Under California law, the duty of such public entities and officials to provide \nS d nr\nee 17  medical care to prisoners is limited to โcases where there is actual or constructive knowledge that \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the prisoner is in need of immediate medical care.โ Id.  This is an objective standard.  Id.  \n19  โ[S]ection 845.6 creates out of the general immunity a limited cause of action against a public \n20  entity for its employeesโ failure to summon immediate medical care onlyโฆThe statute does not \n21  create liability of the public entity for malpractice in furnishing or obtaining that medical \n22  care.โ  Frary v. Cty. of Marin, 81 F. Supp. 3d 811, 842 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (quoting Castaneda v. \n23  Depโt of Corrs. & Rehab., 212 Cal.App.4th 1051, 1070 (2013), review denied (May 1, 2013)).  \n24  Deputy Collins essentially argues that the state law claims must fail for the same reasons \n25  that the section 1983 claims fail: because โ[t]here is simply no evidence to establish that Deputy \n26  Collins denied, delayed or interfered with Parentiโs medical treatment.โ Reply at 11.  On this \n27  point, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that Frary is instructive.  See Oppโn at 24.  In Frary, \n28  although the court found that summary judgment was appropriate against certain deputies because \n29 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 109   Filed 04/06/18   Page 30 of 31\n \n1  section 845.6 does not impose a duty to monitor the quality of care provided, summary judgment \n2  was denied as to Deputy Hammer based on evidence similar to the record in this case. 81 F. Supp. \n3  3d at 842-43.  Like Deputy Collins in this case, Deputy Hammer in Frary was not able to rouse an \n4  inmate who had medical issues after repeatedly yelling and knocking loudly at his door.  Deputy \n5  Hammer took no action to summon medical assistance or to inform other deputies that the inmate \n6  was unresponsive despite repeated knocking and yelling.  With respect to section 845.6, the Frary \n7  court held that โthere is at least a triable issue of fact as to whether [Deputy Hammer] knew or had \n8  reason to know that [the inmate] had an immediate medical need.โ Id.   \n9  Here, it is the โreason to knowโ language that differentiates Plaintiffsโ state law causes of \n10  action from the deliberate indifference standard analyzed above.  Courts have construed the \n11  โknows or has reason to knowโ element in 845.6 to include constructive notice.  See e.g. Lucas v. \n12  Cnty. of L.A., 47 Cal. App. 4th 277, 288 (1996) (holding that the โreason to knowโ in ยง 845.6 is an \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  โobjective standardโ and finding that the duty to provide medical care under ยง 845.6 includes \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  โcases where there is actual or constructive knowledge that the prisoner is in need of immediate \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  medical care.โ) Although Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a triable issue of material fact with \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  respect to whether Deputy Collins was deliberately indifferent to Mr. Parentiโs serious medical \nS d nr\nee 17  needs, there is a triable issue with respect to whether Deputy Collins had โreason to knowโ of such \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  needs and could therefore be liable under state law.  Summary judgment on the negligence and \n19  wrongful death claims would therefore be inappropriate. 16   \n20  A reasonable jury could conclude from Plaintiffsโ evidence that Mr. Parentiโs failure to \n21  respond to being called and shaken was an indication of an immediate medical need, and that \n22  Deputy Collins had reason to know of that need, but failed to take reasonable actions to summon \n23  medical care.  For these reasons, summary judgment on Plaintiffsโ state law causes of action \n24  against Deputy Collins is DENIED.  \n25 \n26                                                   \n16 This analysis also serves as an independent basis for the denial of Deputy Collinsโ motion for \n27 \nsummary judgment on the third cause of action for failure to furnish/summon medical care \npursuant to Government Code sections 844.6 and 845.6.   \n28 \n \n30 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 109   Filed 04/06/18   Page 31 of 31\n \n1    IV.

On March 30, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a motion to exclude \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  expert testimony of County Defendants and CFMG Defendants in which Plaintiffs asked the Court \nd Srn \nee 17  to (1) limit the CFMG Defendants to one retained expert on the topics of cause of death and \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  adequacy of medical care, (2) exclude inadmissible opinions of experts retained by the CFMG \n19  Defendants and the County Defendants, and (3) prohibit testimony by CFMG Defendantsโ non-\n20  retained experts who were not adequately disclosed as required by Rule 26.

RELEVANT FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n3  On September 2, 2016, the District Court entered a Case Scheduling Order setting an \n4  expert disclosure deadline of October 22, 2016, a rebuttal expert disclosure deadline of November \n5  22, 2016, and an expert discovery cutoff of January 17, 2017.  ECF 61.  On October 21, 2016, \n6  CFMG Defendants served their expert witness disclosures pursuant to Rule 26.   \n7  CFMG Defendants disclosed five retained experts and twelve non-retained experts.  Their \n8  listing of non-retained experts identified only each expertโs name, degree, and address.  ECF 76-1 \n9  at 90-94.   \n10  On November 17, 2016, the Court continued the expert disclosure deadline from \n11  November 22, 2016 to January 18, 2017 and continued the last day for expert depositions from \n  12  January 17, 2017 to August 17, 2017.  ECF 64.    \na\nrt ni\nur\noo 13  Plaintiffs and CFMG Defendants met and conferred regarding CFMG Defendantsโ expert \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  disclosure.  Plaintiffs identified, among other objections, that CFMG Defendantsโ list of non-\nstrof \nDict  15  retained experts failed to provide the information required under Rule 26(a)(2)(C), including a \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  summary of facts and opinions.  On January 11, 2017, CFMG Defendants served an amended \nd Srn \nee 17  disclosure providing additional, albeit limited, information regarding the expected testimony of the \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  twelve non-retained witnesses, including Kelly and Greenleaf.  ECF 76-2 at 37-40.  CFMG \n19  Defendants disclosed Kelly and Greenleaf as follows: \n \n20  Julie Kelly, PA-C, c/o CDCR Avenal State Prison, P.S. Box \n39, Avenal,  CA 93204;  (559) 386-0587.  Ms.  Kelly will testify \n21  regarding authentication, interpretation and other issues pertaining \nto  her treatment records and treatment  related to  Mr. Parenti in \n22  connection with his health care at Avenal State Prison.  \n \n23  Delmar Greenleaf, M.D., c/o CDCR Avenal State Prison, \nP.O. Box 39, Avenal, CA 93204; (559) 386-0587.  Dr. Greenleaf \n24  will testify regarding authentication, interpretation and other issues \npertaining  to  his  treatment  records  and  treatment  related  to  Mr. \n25  Parenti in connection with his health care at Avenal State Prison. \n26   \n27  Plaintiffs, in their motion to exclude filed March 30, 2017, argue that Kelly and Greenleaf \n28  should be stricken because the CFMG Defendantsโ disclosures do not satisfy Rule 26.  ECF 76 at \n2 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 88   Filed 05/10/17   Page 3 of 5\n \n1  23-25.  In opposition to Plaintiffโs motion, CFMG Defendants defend only their retained experts \n2  and do not offer a response to Plaintiffsโ arguments regarding the insufficient Rule 26 disclosures \n3  of Kelly and Greenleaf.  See generally ECF 80.2   \n4  II.  LEGAL STANDARD \n5  A party must disclose to other parties the identity of any witness it may use at trial to \n6  present expert testimony.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(A). โUnless otherwise stipulated or ordered by \n7  the court, this disclosure must be accompanied by a written report . . . if the witness is one retained \n8  or specially employed to provide expert testimony . . .โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B).  However, in \n9  cases where a full report is not required under Rule 26(a)(2)(B), a party is required to disclose  \n \n10  the  subject  matter  on  which  the  witness  is  expected  to  present \nevidence . . . [and] a summary of the facts and opinions to which the \n11  witness is expected to testify.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(C).   \n  12  The Advisory Committee Notes explain that Rule 26(a)(2)(C) mandates โsummary disclosures of \na\nrt ni\nur\noo 13  the opinions to be offered by expert witnesses who are not required to provide reports under Rule \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  26(a)(2)(B) and of the facts supporting those opinions.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 advisory committeeโs \nstrof \nDict  15  note to 2010 amendment (noting that physicians or other health care professionals are common \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  examples of witnesses exempt from Rule 26(a)(2)(B)โs written report requirement); see Goodman \nd Srn \nee 17  v. Staples the Office Superstore, LLC, 644 F.3d 817, 826 (9th Cir. 2011) (treating physicians are \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  exempt from Rule 26(a)(2)(B)โs written report requirement to the extent that their opinions were \n19  formed during the course of treatment).   \n20  If a party fails to disclose the facts and opinions to which non-retained experts would \n21  testify, that party has the burden to show โthe failure was substantially justified or is harmless.โ  \n22  Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c); Goodman, 644 F.3d at 826.  In considering whether to exclude testimony, \n23  Rule 37 requires a court to consider the harm, if any, caused by the failure to comply, and provides \n24  alternative, lesser sanctions โinstead ofโ exclusion.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1); Pineda v. City & Cty. \n25 \n                                                 \n2 The Court notes that CFMG Defendants, in the Declaration of Peter G. Bertling, suggest that \n26 \ntheir disclosures are sufficient as compared to Plaintiffsโ disclosures.  ECF 80-1 at 7.  This \nargument is unpersuasive and improperly raised in a declaration in violation of Civil Local Rule 7-\n27 \n5(b).  Civ. L. R. 7-5(b) (โAn affidavit or declaration may contain only facts, must conform as \nmuch as possible to the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e), and must avoid conclusions and \n28 \nargument.โ). \n3 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 88   Filed 05/10/17   Page 4 of 5\n \n1  of San Francisco, 280 F.R.D. 517, 520 (N.D. Cal. 2012) (โLimiting the automatic sanction to \n2  violations โwithout substantial justificationโ coupled with the exception for violations that are \n3  โharmless,โ is needed to avoid unduly harsh penalties in a variety of situations.โ). \n4  III.  ANALYSIS  \n5  The Court finds that CFMG Defendantsโ supplemental disclosures of Kelly and Greenleaf \n6  do not comply with Rule 26(a)(2)(C) because the disclosures, even after supplementation, do not \n7  contain a summary of the facts and opinions to which Kelly and Greenleaf will testify.  The \n8  disclosure required for non-retained experts under Rule 26(a)(2)(C) is โconsiderably less extensive \n9  than the report required by Rule 26(a)(2)(B).โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 advisory committeeโs note to \n10  2010 amendment.  However, the high level summary provided by CFMG Defendants provides \n11  only the most modest description imaginable (e.g., โauthenticationโ and โinterpretationโ) along \n  12  with a catchall category (โother issuesโ) that does nothing to narrow the universe on which Kelly \na\nrt ni\nur\noo 13  and Greenleaf may testify.  These descriptions do not, by themselves, satisfy Rule 26(a)(2)(C).   \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  In its opposition to Plaintiffsโ original motion, CFMG did not address Plaintiffsโ argument \nstrof \nDict  15  regarding non-retained experts, much less offer any argument as to why its lack of compliance \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  with Rule 26 is โsubstantially justifiedโ or โharmless,โ which could excuse it from the sanction of \nd Srn \nee 17  exclusion.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1).  The Court cannot speculate as to whether the failure to \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  properly disclose Kelly and Greenleaf was substantially justified, but the failure to properly \n19  disclose is not harmless, particularly in light of the number of non-retained experts disclosed by \n20  CFMG Defendants.  Absent the disclosure required under Rule 26(a)(2)(C), Plaintiffs cannot \n21  make an informed decision on whether they should depose Kelly and Greenleaf.  If Plaintiffs \n22  choose to depose Kelly and Greenleaf, their ability to prepare for and conduct a meaningful \n23  deposition is undermined by not knowing in advance Kellyโs and Greenleafโs opinions and the \n24  main facts on which those opinions are based.   \n25  Although CFMGโs failure to timely comply with Rule 26(a)(2)(C) is neither substantially \n26  justified nor harmless, and Plaintiffsโ objections have merit, the Court nonetheless will not impose \n27  the harsh sanction of excluding Kelly and Greenleaf entirely from testifying at trial.  Given the \n28  recent order by this Court and the fact that expert depositions are just getting underway, the Court \n4 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 88   Filed 05/10/17   Page 5 of 5\n \n1  limits Kellyโs and Greenleafโs respective testimony as set forth below.   \n2  Kelly:  Kelly may testify only regarding the authentication and interpretation of her \n3  relevant treatment records of and relevant communications with decedent, Jacob Parenti, or any \n4  other Plaintiff. \n5  Greenleaf:  Greenleaf may testify only regarding the authentication and interpretation of \n6  his relevant treatment records of and relevant communications with decedent, Jacob Parenti, or \n7  any other Plaintiff. \n8  Neither Kelly nor Greenleaf may offer testimony regarding any โother issues pertaining to  \n9  . . . treatment records and treatment related to Mr. Parenti in connection with his health care at \n10  Avenal State Prison.โ   \n11  IV.  CONCLUSION \n  12  The undersigned RECOMMENDS that the District Court, in the exercise of its discretion, \na\nrt ni\nur\noo 13  enter an order limiting the expert testimony of Julie Kelly, PA-C and Delmar Greenleaf, M.D. as \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  directed above.  \nstrof \nDict  15   \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  SO RECOMMENDED. \nd Srn \nee 17  Dated: May 10, 2017\nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18   \n19     \nSUSAN VAN KEULEN \n20 \nUnited States Magistrate Judge \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n5 ",

ISSUES TO MAGISTRATE JUDGE \nrts fo SUSAN VAN KEULEN FOR \niD tc 15    DISPOSITION \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16    [Re:  ECF 76] \nS de nre 17       \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18    This action arises out of the death of thirty-three year old Jacob Parenti, who died in his \n19  cell at the Monterey County Jail where he was being held on a probation violation.  Plaintiffs are \n20  the Estate of Jacob Parenti, Mr. Parentiโs minor son, and Mr. Parentiโs mother.  Plaintiffs assert \n21  violations of federal and state law by Monterey County, Sheriff Scott Miller, and Deputy Collins \n22  (โCounty Defendantsโ), as well as California Forensic Medical Group and Dr. Taylor Fithian \n23  (โCFMG Defendantsโ). \n24    Plaintiffs assert that the CFMG Defendants have designated an excessive number of \n25  retained and non-retained experts who offer duplicative and/or inadmissible opinions, and that the \n26  CFMG Defendantsโ disclosures of non-retained experts did not comply with Federal Rule of Civil \n27  Procedure 26.  Plaintiffs also assert that the Countyโs retained experts offer inadmissible opinions.  \n28  Plaintiffs ask the Court to (1) limit the CFMG Defendants to one retained expert on the topics of \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 87   Filed 05/03/17   Page 2 of 11\n \n1  cause of death and adequacy of medical care, (2) exclude inadmissible opinions of experts retained \n2  by the CFMG Defendants and the County Defendants, and (3) prohibit testimony by the CFMG \n3  Defendantsโs non-retained experts who were not adequately disclosed as required by Rule 26. \n4    For the reasons discussed below, Plaintiffsโ motion is GRANTED IN PART AND \n5  DENIED IN PART, and the Rule 26 disclosure issues are REFERRED to Magistrate Judge Susan \n6  van Keulen for disposition. \n7  I.  DISCUSSION \n8    A.  CFMG Defendantsโ Retained Experts โ Duplication \n9    Plaintiffs contend that the CFMG Defendants have designated multiple retained healthcare \n10  professionals who will offer duplicative and cumulative opinions regarding the cause of Mr. \n11  Parentiโs death and whether the medical services provided to Mr. Parenti met the standard of care.  \n12  Plaintiffs ask the Court to exercise its discretion to limit CFMG to a single retained expert on these \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  topics.  In response, the CFMG Defendants assert that their retained experts come from different \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  backgrounds and thus offer different bases for their opinions, and that no one expertโs opinion \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  overlaps in its entirety with any other opinion.   \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16    โThe court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed \nS d nr\nee 17  by a danger of . . . needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.โ  Fed. R. Evid. 403.  Moreover, the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Court has authority to limit the extent of discovery otherwise allowed by federal or local rules if \n19  โthe discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or can be obtained from some \n20  other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n21  26(b)(2)(C)(i). \n22    The Court finds it impossible to determine based on the current record whether exclusion \n23  of any of CFMGโs experts is appropriate under these standards.  Trial is not set to commence for \n24  eighteen months, and none of the experts has yet been deposed.  The Court understands that \n25  Plaintiffs brought this motion at least in part for the very purpose of avoiding the costs of those \n26  depositions.  See Olney Decl. ยถ 4 (โTo even depose each of CFMGโs experts at their required rates \n27  of up to $650 per hour, Plaintiffsโ costs and fees could easily exceed $30,000.โ), ECF 76-1.  \n28  However, the CFMG Defendants have the right to designate the experts of their choice, and it does \n2 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 87   Filed 05/03/17   Page 3 of 11\n \n1  not appear โ at least on this record โ that there is complete overlap with respect to any one expert \n2  witness which would justify that expertโs exclusion.  There is no suggestion that the disclosure is \n3  in bad faith or for any improper purpose.  Accordingly, Plaintiffsโ request that the Court limit the \n4  CFMG Defendants to a single retained expert on the issues of cause of death and standard of care \n5  is DENIED. \n6    The Court does, however, direct the parties to meet and confer regarding the order of the \n7  depositions so that the retained experts who are most likely to testify are deposed first.  Plaintiffs \n8  may wish to depose the one or two experts most likely to testify and seek permission to conduct \n9  late depositions of the other experts after the close of discovery in the event such depositions \n10  become necessary.  In the event that experts who appeared most likely to testify are not called at \n11  trial, the Court would entertain a motion by Plaintiffs for cost-shifting with respect to the \n12  depositions of those experts.      \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13    B.  CFMG Defendantsโ Retained Experts โ Admissibility \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    Plaintiffs also challenge the admissibility of certain aspects of the opinions offered by two \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  of the CFMG Defendantsโ retained experts, Kimberly Pearson, R.N., and Frank Sheridan, M.D. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16      1.  Ms. Pearson \nS d nr\nee 17    Ms. Pearson, a Registered Nurse, offers opinions regarding the standard of medical care \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  provided to Mr. Parenti by the CFMG nursing staff and the cause of Mr. Parentiโs death.  See \n19  Pearson Report, Exh. 2 to Olney Decl., ECF 76-1.  Plaintiffs do not dispute Ms. Pearsonโs \n20  qualifications to offer such opinions.  However, Plaintiffs do object to Ms. Pearsonโs statements \n21  regarding other individualsโ state of mind as well as statements that could be construed as legal \n22  opinion.  For example, Ms. Pearson opines that the CFMG nursing staff โwere not subjectively \n23  aware whether or not Mr. Parenti had a serious medical condition beyond signs and symptoms of \n24  an upper respiratory infection in January 2014, and they did not consciously disregard his \n25  healthcare needs.โ  Id. at 14.  She also opines that โCFMG nursing staff did not attempt to harm \n26  Mr. Jacob Parenti.โ  Id. at 18.  Those opinions would be inadmissible at trial.  See Siring v. \n27  Oregon State Bd. of Higher Educ. ex rel. E. Oregon Univ., 927 F. Supp. 2d 1069, 1077 (D. Or. \n28  2013) (โCourts routinely exclude as impermissible expert testimony as to intent, motive, or state \n3 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 87   Filed 05/03/17   Page 4 of 11\n \n1  of mind.โ); Pinal Creek Grp. v. Newmont Mining Corp., 352 F. Supp. 2d 1037, 1043 (D. Ariz. \n2  2005) (expert witness may not give an opinion on a question of law). \n3    Plaintiffโs motion to exclude is GRANTED with respect to Ms. Pearsonโs opinions \n4  regarding the state of mind of other individuals or questions of law.  Ms. Pearson may, however, \n5  testify regarding the conduct of individuals in response to properly stated questions. \n6      2.  Dr. Sheridan      \n7    Dr. Sheridan, a pathologist, offers the opinion that the cause of Mr. Parentiโs death was \n8  acute heroin toxicity.  See Sheridan Report, Exh. 2 to Olney Decl., ECF 76-1.  Plaintiffs assert that \n9  Dr. Sheridanโs opinion is inadmissible because he failed to perform an adequate differential \n10  diagnosis.  โDifferential diagnosis, or differential etiology, is a standard scientific technique of \n11  identifying the cause of a medical problem by eliminating the likely causes until the most probable \n12  one is isolated.โ  Clausen v. M/V NEW CARISSA, 339 F.3d 1049, 1057 (9th Cir. 2003) (citation \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  omitted).  โThe first step in the diagnostic process is to compile a comprehensive list of \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  hypotheses that might explain the set of salient clinical findings under consideration.โ  Id.  โAfter \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the expert rules in all of the potential hypotheses that might explain a patientโs symptoms, he or \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  she must then engage in a process of elimination, eliminating hypotheses on the basis of a \nS d nr\nee 17  continuing examination of the evidence so as to reach a conclusion as to the most likely cause of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the findings in that particular case.โ  Id. at 1058.  Federal courts generally have found properly \n19  conducted differential diagnoses to be admissible under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, \n20  Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993).  Clausen, 339 F.3d at 1057.  However, a district court is justified in \n21  excluding evidence if the expert fails to explain why an alternative cause was ruled out.  Id. at \n22  1058. \n23    Plaintiffs appear to assume that Dr. Sheridan performed a differential diagnosis and they \n24  challenge the adequacy of that diagnosis based on Dr. Sheridanโs failure to rule out as a possible \n25  cause of death โ or even to address โ a finding in the Monterey County toxicology report that Mr. \n26  Parentiโs blood sample revealed a level of amitriptyline in the toxic range.  That argument is \n27  unpersuasive, because Dr. Sheridanโs report does not indicate that he utilized differential diagnosis \n28  methodology to reach his conclusion regarding cause of death.  See Sheridan Report, Exh. 2 to \n4 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 87   Filed 05/03/17   Page 5 of 11\n \n1  Olney Decl., ECF 76-1.  Dr. Sheridan states that his opinion is based on review of two separate \n2  autopsy reports, microscopic slides from both autopsies, toxicology reports, investigative reports, \n3  and other materials.  Id.  He notes that the autopsy report prepared by Monterey County \n4  determined the cause of death to be โAcute mixed drug intoxication,โ while the autopsy report \n5  prepared by Dr. David Posey determined the cause of death as โviral flu syndrome complicated by \n6  pneumonia, sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, septic shock and multi-organ \n7  system failure.โ  Id. at 125.  Dr. Sheridan then opines that โ[t]he evidence in this case points \n8  clearly to death being the result of acute heroin toxicityโ and gives his reasons for rejecting the \n9  conclusion of sepsis and organ failure presented in Dr. Poseyโs autopsy report.  Id.  Dr. Sheridan \n10  does not purport to address โall of the potential hypotheses that might explain a patientโs \n11  symptomsโ as would be required for a differential diagnosis.  See Clausen, 339 F.3d at 1058.  \n12  Since it does not appear that Dr. Sheridan performed a differential diagnosis at all, Plaintiffsโ \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  argument that he did not perform an โadequateโ differential diagnosis provides no basis for \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  exclusion. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15    To the extent that Plaintiffs argue that differential diagnosis is the only methodology which \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  may be used to determine cause of death, such argument is unsupported by the case law.  โWhile \nS d nr\nee 17  the Ninth Circuit has stated that โa reliable differential diagnosis passes muster under Daubert,โ it \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  has not required experts to use that method when reaching their conclusions.โ  Carrion v. United \n19  States, No. 2:13-cv-00419-RFB-NJK, 2016 WL 4087104, at *5 (D. Nev. July 28, 2016) (quoting \n20  Clausen, 339 F.3d at 1058).  Thus a district court need not exclude an expertโs opinion on \n21  causation simply because the expert did not apply differential diagnosis.  See Millenkamp v. \n22  Davisco Foods Intโl, Inc., 562 F.3d 971, 979 (9th Cir. 2009) (Exclusion was not warranted \n23  because expert โdid not purport to employ differential diagnosis, and Clausen does not preclude \n24  the use of all other methods to determine the cause of an illnessโ); Carrion, 2016 WL 4087104, at \n25  *5 (โWhile differential diagnosis is one universally accepted method for establishing medical \n26  causation in certain contexts, a plaintiff can nonetheless present expert medical testimony that \n27  does not include this method provided that it meets Rule 702โs threshold reliability requirement.โ). \n28    The cases cited by Plaintiffs are not to the contrary.  In Nelson and Whisnant, the Ninth \n5 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 87   Filed 05/03/17   Page 6 of 11\n \n1  Circuit held that the district courts had not abused their discretion in excluding expert opinions \n2  that expressly relied on differential diagnosis but failed to consider alternate causes.  Nelson v. \n3  Matrixx Initiatives, Inc., 592 F. Appโx 591, 592 (9th Cir. 2015); Whisnant v. United States, 274 F. \n4  Appโx 536, 537 (9th Cir. 2008).  In Morin, the Ninth Circuit held that the district court had not \n5  abused its discretion in concluding that the expertโs methodology was not sufficiently reliable \n6  where it was unclear whether or how the expert had applied differential diagnosis.  Morin v. \n7  United States, 244 F. Appโx 142, 143 (9th Cir. 2007).   \n8    Plaintiffsโ motion to exclude Dr. Sheridanโs opinion for lack of an adequate differential \n9  diagnosis is DENIED.   \n10    C.  County Defendantsโ Retained Experts โ Admissibility \n11    Plaintiffs also challenge the admissibility of the opinions offered by the County \n12  Defendantโs two retained experts, James Sida and Timur Durrani, M.D. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13    1.  Mr. Sida \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    Mr. Sida is offered as an expert on jail operations, policies and procedures.  Plaintiffs \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  contend that he goes well beyond that subject matter and offers numerous inadmissible legal \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  opinions, medical opinions, and other opinions outside the scope of his expertise.  The parties, and \nS d nr\nee 17  in particular the County Defendants, have provided what amounts to a line-by-line analysis of Mr. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Sidaโs lengthy report.  See Sida Report, Exh. 1 to Olney Decl., ECF 76-1.  The Court declines to \n19  address Mr. Sidaโs report at that level of detail at this stage of the proceedings, that is, before Mr. \n20  Sida is deposed and a year and a half before trial.  However, Plaintiffsโ motion is well-taken with \n21  respect to the categories of opinions they identify, as discussed below.    \n22      a.  Legal Opinions \n23    โExpert testimony is admissible when it will assist the trier of fact in understanding the \n24  evidence or determining a disputed issue of fact.โ  Pinal Creek Grp., 352 F. Supp. 2d at 1042.   \n25  However, experts may not opine about how the law should apply to the facts of a particular case.  \n26  Id. โTestimony which articulates and applies the relevant law . . . circumvents the [fact finderโs] \n27  decision-making function by telling it how to decide the case.โ  Id. (internal quotation marks and \n28  citation omitted) (alterations in original).   \n6 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 87   Filed 05/03/17   Page 7 of 11\n \n1    Mr. Sida offers a number of opinions purporting to apply the relevant law to the facts of \n2  this case in a manner expressly prohibited by the above standards.  For example, he states that โit \n3  is clear to me that the Sheriff and County is [sic] not indifferent to crowding and other jail issues,โ \n4  and that โ[i]t is my conclusion that the medical services provided in the Monterey County Jail \n5  meet Constitutional requirements from a jail management perspective.โ  Sida Report, Exh. 1 to \n6  Olney Decl. at 24, 29, ECF 76-1.  These and all similar opinions would be excluded at trial. \n7    Plaintiffโs motion to exclude is GRANTED with respect to Mr. Sidaโs legal opinions.  The \n8  Court notes that Mr. Sida does appear to be qualified to testify regarding jail management, \n9  policies, and practices.  Therefore, while some of his opinions are inartfully cast as legal opinions \n10  in his report, he may be able to testify regarding the underlying subject matter of those opinions in \n11  response to proper questioning. \n12      b.  Medical Opinions \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13    โA witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  education may testifyโ if the expertโs โspecialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.โ  Fed. R. Evid. 702.  Mr. Sida is not a \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  medical professional, yet he offers medical opinions regarding the standard of medical care \nS d nr\nee 17  provided by the CFMG Defendants and the cause of Mr. Parentiโs death.  Plaintiffs cite numerous \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  examples of such opinions in their motion, only a few which are set forth here by way of example.  \n19  Mr. Sida states that โI have found that the Monterey County Sheriffโs Department, by way of their \n20  jail staff, does provide adequate custodial medical care which meets the standard of medical care \n21  in the community.โ  Sida Report, Exh. 1 to Olney Decl. at 24-25, 29, ECF 76-1.  He also opines \n22  that โI believe that Mr. Parenti passed very quickly and therefore it would be unreasonable to \n23  expect that Deputy Collins could have foreseen the serious consequence of Mr. Parentiโs ingestion \n24  of heroin.โ  Id. at 35.  In another example, Mr. Sida โassert[s] that the Monterey County Sheriffโs \n25  Department and their medical service contractor, CFMG did, in fact, comply with professional \n26  standards established in the State of California, which includes competent and appropriate medical \n27  treatment to Mr. Parenti and their timely response in the emergency that preceded Mr. Parentiโs \n28  death.โ  Id. at 53.  These and similar medical opinions would be excluded at trial. \n7 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 87   Filed 05/03/17   Page 8 of 11\n \n1    Plaintiffโs motion to exclude is GRANTED with respect to Mr. Sidaโs medical opinions.  \n2  While Mr. Sida may not offer medical opinion regarding the adequacy of medical services actually \n3  provided to Mr. Parenti, he does appear to be qualified to testify regarding the appropriate level of \n4  medical services for which a facility such as the Monterey County Jail should contract.  \n5      c.  Opinions Regarding Drug Smuggling \n6    Mr. Sida offers opinions regarding the smuggling of drugs into the Monterey County Jail.  \n7  While he appears to be qualified to opine regarding drug smuggling in jails generally, his report \n8  does not disclose an adequate basis for his opinions regarding smuggling in Monterey County Jail \n9  in particular.  See Lopez v. I-Flow Inc., No. CV 08-1063-PHX-SRB, 2011 WL 1897548, at *10 \n10  (D. Ariz. Jan. 26, 2011) (โUnder Rule 26, an expertโs written report must include an explanation \n11  of the basis and reasons for each expressed opinion.โ).

Opinions Regarding In-Custody Deaths       \nS d nr\nee 17    Mr. Sida also offers opinions regarding the statistical significance of the number of in-\nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  custody deaths that occurred at the Monterey County Jail.  For example, he opines that the three \n19  in-custody deaths that occurred in 2014 โare simply events and not trends relating to in custody \n20  deaths in the jail.โ  Sida Report, Exh. 1 to Olney Decl. at 39, ECF 76-1.  Mr. Sidaโs report does \n21  not identify any background, education, or training in the field of statistics.  He provides a chart \n22  comparing in-custody deaths in Monterey County with such deaths in fourteen other โcomparable \n23  counties,โ but he does not provide an adequate basis for limiting his comparison to the selected \n24  counties while excluding dozens of other California counties.  Accordingly, Mr. Sidaโs opinions \n25  regarding the statistical significance of the in-custody deaths at the Monterey County Jail would \n26  be excluded at trial. \n27    Plaintiffโs motion to exclude is GRANTED with respect to Mr. Sidaโs opinions regarding \n28  the statistical significance of in-custody deaths at the Monterey County Jail. \n8 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 87   Filed 05/03/17   Page 9 of 11\n \n1      e.  Rebuttal Opinion \n2    โ[A] rebuttal expert cannot offer evidence that does not contradict or rebut another expertโs \n3  disclosure.โ  Theoharis v. Rongen, No. C13-1345RAJ, 2014 WL 3563386, at *3 (W.D. Wash. July \n4  18, 2014).  Plaintiffs argue that portions of Mr. Sidaโs rebuttal report to one of Plaintiffsโ experts, \n5  Jeffrey Schwartz, go beyond mere rebuttal and are intended to buttress opinions offered in Mr. \n6  Sidaโs own expert report.  See Sida Rebuttal Report, Exh. 10 to Olney Decl., ECF 76-2.  Plaintiffsโ \n7  argument is well-taken, and the County Defendants offer no meaningful opposition.   \n8    Plaintiffโs motion to exclude is GRANTED with respect to Mr. Sidaโs rebuttal opinions \n9  which do not actually contradict or rebut Mr. Schwartzโs opinion.    \n10    The Court notes that the County Defendants argue that the rebuttal report of Plaintiffsโ \n11  expert, Mr. Schwartz, also exceeds the permissible scope of rebuttal evidence.  The County \n12  Defendants have not moved to exclude testimony of Plaintiffsโ expert, and thus their argument \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  regarding Mr. Schwartzโs rebuttal report is not addressed in this order. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    2.  Dr. Durrani \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15    Dr. Durrani offers opinions primarily regarding the services provided by the Monterey \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  County Public Health Department.  See Durrani Report, Exh. 1 to Olney Decl., ECF 76-1.  For \nS d nr\nee 17  example, he opines that the Department โacted appropriately in assisting the jail by balancing the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  needs to protect public health while not placing an onerous burden on the jail, the staff and the \n19  inmates.โ  Id. at 78.  Dr. Durrani further opines that the Public Health Department โmeets the \n20  standard of care expected of local health officers when dealing with disease outbreaks in \n21  correctional facilities.  Id. at 79.  Plaintiffs contend that Dr. Durrani is not qualified to give these \n22  and similar opinions because he does not have any background in the correctional field.  Plaintiffs \n23  also contend that Dr. Durrani does not actually offer any original analysis but merely parrots the \n24  deposition testimony of Ms. Kristy Michie. \n25    The Court concludes that Dr. Durrani may testify on topics within his area of expertise, \n26  such as the functioning of the Monterey County Public Health Department and the standard of \n27  care for a county public health department.  However, the Court is troubled by Dr. Durraniโs \n28  opinions regarding a correctional facilityโs ability to implement commonly applied public health \n9 \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 87   Filed 05/03/17   Page 10 of 11\n \n1  techniques for identifying the nature of a contagious pathogen and mitigating its transmission.  It \n2  appears that Dr. Durrani has relied on Ms. Michieโs testimony regarding the correctional facilityโs \n3  capabilities.  To the extent that Dr. Durraniโs opinions are based solely on Ms. Michieโs testimony, \n4  they will be excluded at trial.  See Depโt of Toxic Substances Control v.

Mar. 15, 2016) (excluding expert opinion in \n6  part because expert โoften does no more than regurgitate information given to him by other \n7  sourcesโ). \n8    At the hearing counsel for the County Defendants stated that Dr. Durraniโs opinions are \n9  offered only to counter any claim of liability based on deficiencies by the Monterey County Public \n10  Health Department, not to bolster the Countyโs position regarding the jailโs response.  Insofar as it \n11  is not clear whether this issue will be presented at trial, and the County Defendantsโ clarification \n12  of Dr. Durraniโs potential testimony, the Court is not prepared to exclude Dr. Durrani entirely at \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  this time. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    Accordingly, Plaintiffsโ motion to exclude Dr. Durrani is GRANTED to the extent that his \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  opinions are based solely on Ms. Michieโs testimony and otherwise is DENIED.    \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16    D.

On January 15, 2014, Defendants left Jacob Parenti, a 33 year-old man \n3  in Monterey County Jail for a probation violation, lying unconscious, helpless, and \n4  untreated on his dorm bed to die.  Through this lawsuit, Plaintiffs seek to hold \n5  Defendants accountable for refusing to provide basic health care to Mr. Parenti, \n6  resulting in his death. \n7  2.  At the time of Jacob Parentiโs death in January 2014, the Jail was \n8  already the subject of a federal putative class action lawsuit regarding systemic \n9  failures to provide adequate medical and mental health care, resulting in \n10  unnecessary harm, suffering, and death.  However, the County, its Sheriff and \n11  officers have stubbornly refused to address these known issues and to adopt \n12  policies, procedures, and practices to provide minimum standards of treatment for \n13  inmates.  \n14  JURISDICTION \n15  3.  This Complaint seeks damages for the violation of the civil rights, \n16  privileges, and immunities guaranteed by the First, Eighth, and Fourteenth \n17  Amendments of the United States Constitution, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983 and \n18  1988, as well as for violations of California state law.   \n19  4.  This Court has jurisdiction over this lawsuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง \n20  1331 and 1343. \n21  5.  This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims \n22  asserted herein pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367, because the claims form part of the \n23  same case or controversy arising under the United States Constitution and federal \n24  law. \n25  VENUE \n26  6.  Plaintiffsโ claims, alleged herein, arose in the County of Monterey, \n27  California. Venue therefore lies in the Northern District of California pursuant to 28 \n28  U.S.C. ยง 1391(b)(2). \n   \n-1- \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-05481-PSG   Document1   Filed12/16/14   Page3 of 22\n \n1  7.  Rule 3 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rule 3-2(e) \n2  authorizes assignment to this division because a substantial part of the events or \n3  omissions giving rise to Plaintiffsโ claims occurred in the counties served by this \n4  division. \n5  PARTIES \n6  8.  Plaintiff D.P-O. is the seven year-old minor son and sole heir of Jacob \n7  Parenti.  Plaintiff D.P-O. brings his individual claims by and through Matthew \n8  Oberholtz, his legal guardian. They reside in Butte County, California.   \n9  9.  Plaintiff D.P-O. also brings claims on behalf of the Estate of Jacob \n10  Parenti, by and through his legal guardian Matthew Oberholtz, pursuant to \n11  California Code of Civil Procedure ยงยง 377.10 et seq. At the time of his death, Jacob \n12  Parenti was a 33 year-old citizen of the United States and resident of the County of \n13  Monterey in the State of California.  The survival causes of action in this matter are \n14  based on violations of Jacob Parentiโs rights under the U.S. Constitution and \n15  California state law. \n16  10.  Plaintiff Susan Parenti is the mother of Jacob Parenti, and resides in \n17  Monterey County, California. She is suing individually for violations of civil rights \n18  under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and California state law. \n19  11.  Defendant County of Monterey is a public entity, duly organized and \n20  existing under the laws of the State of California. Under its authority, Defendant \n21  County of Monterey operates and manages Monterey County Jail and is and was at \n22  all relevant times mentioned herein responsible for the actions and/or inactions and \n23  the policies, procedures, and practices/customs of the Monterey County Sheriffโs \n24  Office and Monterey County Jail, and each entityโs respective employees and/or \n25  agents. Monterey County Sheriffโs Office operates Monterey County Jail, and is \n26  and was responsible for ensuring the provision of emergency and medical and \n27  mental health care services to all Monterey County Jail inmates.  Monterey County \n28  Sheriffโs Office also operates the Office of the Coroner. \n   \n-2- \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-05481-PSG   Document1   Filed12/16/14   Page4 of 22\n \n1  12.  Defendant Scott Miller is, and was at all relevant times mentioned \n2  herein, the Sheriff-Coroner of the County of Monterey, the highest position in the \n3  Monterey County Sheriffโs Office. As Sheriff-Coroner, Defendant Miller is and \n4  was responsible for the hiring, screening, training, retention, supervision, discipline, \n5  counseling, and control of all Monterey County Sheriffโs Office custodial \n6  employees and/or agents.  Defendant Miller is and was charged by law with the \n7  administration of the Monterey County Jail, and is responsible for safety and \n8  security of inmates housed at the Jail.  Defendant Miller also is and was responsible \n9  for the promulgation of the policies and procedures and allowance of the \n10  practices/customs pursuant to which the acts of the Monterey County Sheriffโs \n11  Office alleged herein were committed.  As Sheriff-Coroner, Defendant Miller is \n12  also charged with oversight of the Coronerโs Division of the Monterey County \n13  Sheriffโs Office.  Defendant Miller is being sued in his individual and official \n14  capacities. \n15  13.  Defendant Collins is, and was at all relevant times mentioned herein, \n16  an officer in the Monterey County Sheriffโs Office.  While on shift at the Jail, he \n17  was and is responsible for the safety and security of inmates including inmates in \n18  his assigned wing(s).  On January 15, 2014, Defendant Collins was on duty at the \n19  Monterey County Jail and participated in announcing inmates in D-wing for sick \n20  call, including Jacob Parenti.  When Mr. Parenti did not respond for sick call, \n21  Defendant Collins entered the dorm and walked to Mr. Parentiโs bunk.  Defendant \n22  Collins unsuccessfully attempted to rouse Mr. Parenti verbally and physically.  \n23  Despite Mr. Parentiโs clear inability to respond, and a clear need for emergency \n24  medical treatment, after this attempt, Defendant Collins simply left the dormitory \n25  and did not provide or summon assistance for Mr. Parenti. \n26  14.  Defendant California Forensic Medical Group (โCFMGโ) is a \n27  California corporation headquartered based in Monterey, California. CFMG is a \n28  private for-profit correctional health care provider that services approximately 65 \n   \n-3- \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-05481-PSG   Document1   Filed12/16/14   Page5 of 22\n \n1  correctional facilities in 27 California counties.  The County of Monterey contracts \n2  with CFMG to provide medical, mental health, and dental services for the Monterey \n3  County Jail.  The Institute for Medical Quality (IMQ) declined to certify CFMGโs \n4  services at the Monterey County Jail, and IMQ has accredited only 9 of CFMGโs \n5  approximately 65 facilities in California.  At all times relevant herein, CFMG was \n6  responsible for the health services provided to Jacob Parenti during his detention in \n7  the Monterey County Jail. \n8  15.  Defendant Taylor Fithian is, and was at all relevant times mentioned \n9  herein, the co-founder, President, and Medical Director for Defendant CFMG. \n10  Defendant Fithian is a Board-certified psychiatrist and oversees the delivery of \n11  medical, mental health and dental care in all CFMG-served facilities, including \n12  standards of medical care and utilization review. Defendant Fithian is and was \n13  responsible for the promulgation of the policies and procedures and allowance of \n14  the practices/customs pursuant to which the acts of California Forensic Medical \n15  Group alleged herein were committed. In addition, Defendant Fithian personally \n16  provides health services at Monterey County Jail.  Defendant Fithian is sued in his \n17  individual capacity. \n18  16.  Defendants Miller, Collins, and Fithian engaged in the acts or \n19  omissions described herein under color of state law. \n20  17.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that at all times \n21  mentioned in this Complaint, Defendants, and each of them, were the agents, \n22  employees, servants, joint venturers, partners and/or co-conspirators of the other \n23  Defendants named in this Complaint and that at all times, each of the Defendants \n24  was acting within the course and scope of said relationship with Defendants. \n25  EXHUASTION OF PRE-LAWSUIT PROCEDURES FOR  \n26  STATE LAW CLAIMS \n27  18.  Plaintiffs filed governmental tort claims with Defendant County of \n28  Monterey on behalf of the Estate of Jacob Parenti, Susan Parenti, and D.P-O. on \n   \n-4- \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-05481-PSG   Document1   Filed12/16/14   Page6 of 22\n \n1  July 3, 2014.  By correspondence dated August 7, 2014, the County of Monterey \n2  rejected the governmental tort claims. \n3  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n4  I.  History of Inadequate Medical Care in Monterey County Jail \n5  19.  County of Monterey, Monterey County Sheriffโs Office, CFMG, and \n6  Taylor Fithian have been on notice that their provision of medical care to inmates at \n7  the Monterey County Jail is inadequate and results in needless harm and suffering \n8  since at least 2007, when the Monterey County Sheriffโs Office and the Monterey \n9  County Board of Supervisors hired an outside consulting firm to perform a needs \n10  assessment for the Jail. (See Ex. 1.) The 2007 Assessment concluded that the Jail \n11  was severely overcrowded, lacked adequate numbers of staff, and that \n12  โmedical/mental health treatment spaces are not adequate for the rated beds, let \n13  alone the actual number of inmates held.โ (Ex. 1 at 1, Executive Summary at 1.)  It \n14  further concluded that shortfalls in staffing result in hiring of โpre-academyโ \n15  officers, unmanageable supervision loads for first line supervisors, and insufficient \n16  staff on some shifts to make required safety checks. The Monterey County Board of \n17  Supervisors accepted the report by unanimous vote on June 19, 2007.    \n18  20.  At the request of Defendant Miller, the independent assessment was \n19  updated in 2011 and found that County of Monterey physical facilities and their \n20  policies and practices for delivering medical treatment remained inadequate. The \n21  2011 Assessment similarly found that the Jailโs โMedical/mental health treatment \n22  spaces are not adequate for the rated beds, let alone the actual number of inmates \n23  heldโ and therefore prevent adequate delivery of medical health care. (Ex. 2, \n24  Executive Summary at 3.) The 2011 Assessment further noted the direct impact on \n25  overcrowding on prisonersโ overall health, stating that โOvercrowding affects \n26  inmatesโ mental and physical health by increasing the level of uncertainty with \n27  which they regularly cope.โ (Ex. 2, Executive Summary at 9.)  \n28 \n   \n-5- \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-05481-PSG   Document1   Filed12/16/14   Page7 of 22\n \n1  21.  The Assessment also found that chronic understaffing hinders the \n2  County of Montereyโs ability to provide medical care, classify and move inmates \n3  within the facility, maintain inmate safety and security, and transport inmates to and \n4  from outside agencies. (Ex. 2, Executive Summary at 6, 8.) \n5  22.  Both the 2007 Needs Assessment and the 2011 Jail Needs Assessment \n6  concluded that, โ[t]he current combination of insufficient beds, an inadequate \n7  detention facility and understaffing has resulted in an almost untenable situation.โ \n8  (Ex. 1, Executive Summary at 1โ2, A.3; Ex. 2, Executive Summary at 2, A.2.) \n9  23.  Much of the 2011 Assessmentโs findings were confirmed in a 2013 \n10  draft report by an expert hired by the County of Monterey, Dr. Richard Hayward \n11  (โHayward Reportโ). (See Ex. 3.) The County tasked Dr. Hayward with evaluating \n12  mental health care at Monterey County Jail in response to a federal class action \n13  lawsuit challenging Monterey Countyโs provisions of medical and mental health \n14  care at the Jail. See Hernandez v. Cnty. Of Monterey, No. 13-cv-2354-PSG (N.D. \n15  Cal. Filed May 23, 2013). The Hayward Report, dated December 6, 2013, identified \n16  serious deficiencies in the delivery of medical health care at the Monterey County \n17  Jail, including inmates not receiving responses to their written health requests. \n18  According to the Hayward Report, โthe current procedures lack a systematic \n19  method of auditing receipt of and responses to all inmate requests for health \n20  services.โ (Ex. 3 at 3.) \n21  24.  Further, according to the allegations contained in the Hernandez v. \n22  County of Monterey complaint (Ex. 4), the Jail fails to:  \n23  a.  Provide medically necessary treatments for prisoners upon their \n24  arrival at the Jail (Ex. 4 at 42โ43, 52โ55); \n25  b.  Provide adequate care in emergency situations (Ex. 4 at 55โ59); \n26  c.  Provide adequate diagnostic care to prisoners, including failing \n27  to appropriately refer prisoners to outside specialists when \n28  necessary (Ex. 4 at 59โ61);  \n   \n-6- \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-05481-PSG   Document1   Filed12/16/14   Page8 of 22\n \n1  d.  Provide post-operative and other medically necessary follow-up \n2  care to prisoners (Ex. 4 at 61โ64); and \n3  e.  Maintain adequate, accurate, and complete medical care records \n4  (Ex. 4 at 64โ67).  \n5  25.  Moreover, on April 15, 2013, County of Monterey was again \n6  specifically put on notice of the serious problems with its delivery of \n7  constitutionally adequate health care in the jail as well as its failure to protect \n8  prisoners from harm in a letter sent to the County from counsel for plaintiffs in \n9  Hernandez v. County of Monterey. (See Ex. 5 at 4โ8.) These problems include \n10  inadequate screening processes for identifying prisoners with serious and chronic \n11  medical issues, refusal to continue treatment prisoners were already prescribed, \n12  imposition of punitive โdetoxโ procedures that deny prisoners their prescribed pain \n13  medications, and denial of necessary treatment to prisoners to avoid the expense of \n14  such treatment. (Id. at 6โ7.) The letter also identifies the Jailโs overcrowding and \n15  understaffing as reasons why prisoners are not protected from harm when \n16  incarcerated. (Id. at 8.) \n17  26.  As of the date of this filing, at least three inmates of Monterey County \n18  Jail have died in the custody of Monterey County officials in 2014, including Jacob \n19  Parenti. See Allison Gatlin, โThird inmate this year dies in Monterey County Jail,โ \n20  THE SALINAS CALIFORNIAN, Oct. 27, 2014, available at http://goo.gl/ky5Gve. \n21  II.  Jacob Parentiโs Death \n22  27.  Jacob Parenti was born in Aromas, California, in 1980.  In 1982, his \n23  family moved to Monterey, California.   \n24  28.  Mr. Parenti is described by those who knew him as an unusually \n25  thoughtful, personable, and caring individual, who took time to listen and connect \n26  with others.   \n27  29.  He attended public school in Monterey, California, where he excelled \n28  in golf.  Although he did not graduate from high school, he earned his GED. \n   \n-7- \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-05481-PSG   Document1   Filed12/16/14   Page9 of 22\n \n1  30.  Mr. Parenti lived primarily with his mother, Susan Parenti, and father, \n2  Phil Parenti, until his father passed away when Jacob Parenti was approximately \n3  eighteen years old. \n4  31.  During a portion of his teen years, and after his father passed away, \n5  Jacob Parenti lived with his half-sister, Amy Vye (nรฉe Parenti), and half-brother, \n6  Americo Parenti, who are thirteen and ten years older than Jacob, respectively, and \n7  with whom he was very close.   \n8  32.  After Mr. Parentiโs son, D.P-O., was born in 2007, D.P-O. lived with \n9  his birth mother in San Luis Obispo.  Mr. Parenti had an ongoing relationship with \n10  D.P-O., making child support payments and regular visits when possible to spend \n11  time with D.P-O. in San Luis Obispo.  Mr. Parenti also brought D.P-O. to spend \n12  time with his family, including his sister, Amy Vye, and his older cousin, Matthew \n13  Oberholtz, with whom Mr. Parenti was also very close. \n14  33.  In 2012, Mr. Parenti was the property manager for a residential \n15  property in Monterey.  In this capacity, he restored the property, brought it up to \n16  code, and managed that residence.  \n17  34.  In late 2012, Mr. Parenti petitioned for custody of D.P-O. because \n18  D.P-O.โs birth mother was not able to provide a stable home for D.P-O.  Mr. Parenti \n19  wanted to ensure that his son was taken care of and provided a stable, healthy \n20  environment.  Mr. Parenti was aware of his own challenges, including struggling \n21  with substance addiction, and told his family members that he was not going to let \n22  what happened to him happen to his son.  Because of this self-awareness, before \n23  petitioning for custody of D.P-O., Mr. Parenti asked his cousin, Mr. Oberholtz, if he \n24  would be willing to provide a stable home for D.P-O. in the event Mr. Parenti was \n25  unable to do so.  Mr. Oberholtz lives in Butte County where he runs a waterski \n26  school for able bodied and disabled athletes, and has long been involved in \n27  coaching teams for paralympic athletes, including the U.S. paralympic waterskiing \n28  team.  Mr. Oberholtz agreed, and spent considerable time with Mr. Parenti and D.P-\n   \n-8- \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-05481-PSG   Document1   Filed12/16/14   Page10 of 22\n \n1  O. \n2  35.  At the beginning of 2013, Mr. Parenti and Mr. Oberholtz jointly \n3  attended a court hearing at which Mr. Parenti was awarded primary custody of D.P-\n4  O.  Mr. Parenti brought D.P-O. to Monterey to live with him there, and enrolled \n5  D.P-O. in school and extracurricular activities.   \n6  36.  In February 2013, Mr. Parenti was charged with a probation violation \n7  for which he was given a three month sentence.  In order to ensure that D.P-O. \n8  would have as much stability as possible, and not continue to be placed in and out \n9  of different homes and schools, Mr. Parenti asked Mr. Oberholtz to assume \n10  guardianship of his son at this time.  D.P-O. moved to live with Mr. Oberholtz in \n11  Oroville, California.  \n12  37.  After Mr. Parenti was released from custody in April 2013, he was \n13  employed at a medical marijuana farm, and was interviewing for a position with the \n14  Sign and Display Union, which sets up and takes down displays at the Moscone \n15  Center.  In addition to his position as property manager, he had also previously \n16  worked in computer repairs and as an assistant foreman for an asphalt and seal \n17  coating company. \n18  38.  Mr. Parenti also regularly helped his mother, Susan Parenti, by doing \n19  household chores, making food for her, helping with car and computer \n20  maintenance, assisting her with physical tasks she was unable to complete because \n21  of disabilities following back surgery, including physically carrying her and \n22  otherwise helping her to move around the house, and acting as her caretaker with \n23  respect to some of her medical and physical needs.   \n24  39.  In mid-2013, Mr. Parenti was charged with a probation violation for \n25  possessing a small amount of marijuana as part of a vehicle stop on his way home \n26  from work.  On information and belief, Mr. Parenti was offered a choice between a \n27  one-year jail term, after which, he would no longer be on probation, or a two-year \n28  extension of his probation.  Mr. Parenti chose the jail term because he wanted to be \n   \n-9- \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-05481-PSG   Document1   Filed12/16/14   Page11 of 22\n \n1  able to move up to Butte County to live near D.P-O., and an extended probation \n2  term would delay his ability to move because the conditions of his probation \n3  restricted residency to Monterey County. \n4  40.   Mr. Parenti began the one-year jail term for this probation violation at \n5  Monterey County Jail on or around August 1, 2013.   \n6  41.  Mr. Parenti actively maintained a relationship with his son while he \n7  was in Jail, including writing letters and cards to him in which Mr. Parenti told D.P-\n8  O. how much he loved him and that he was proud of him.   \n9  42.  Mr. Parenti also maintained relationships with his other family \n10  members while he was in Jail, including his mother, sister, brother, and other \n11  family.  He spoke with them regularly by telephone and exchanged letters with \n12  them.  He also wrote to his six year-old niece, Ms. Vyeโs daughter, sending her \n13  special birthday and holiday cards. \n14  43.  Mr. Parenti was housed in the D-wing dormitory of Monterey County \n15  Jail, which is a medium security unit and houses approximately 90-100 men in a \n16  dorm setting, with bunk beds and tables. \n17  44.  Throughout the first months of his incarceration, Mr. Parenti informed \n18  his mother that the Jail was not consistently providing him his prescribed blood \n19  pressure and psychotropic medications.  Susan Parenti called the Jail many times \n20  and physically brought Mr. Parentiโs medications to the Jail and handed them to a \n21  nurse at the Jail in order to attempt to ensure that Mr. Parenti received his \n22  medications. \n23  45.  On or around January 10, 2014, Mr. Parenti developed flu-like \n24  symptoms.  He followed the Jailโs procedures for seeking medical care and put in a \n25  sick call request by filling out a written request, and placing it in the front gate of \n26  D-wing.  On this sick call slip, Mr. Parenti wrote โhave the flu.โ \n27  46.  Around the same time period, Mr. Parenti began coughing up blood.   \n28  / / / \n   \n-10- \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-05481-PSG   Document1   Filed12/16/14   Page12 of 22\n \n1  47.  Mr. Parenti did not receive a medical appointment in response to the \n2  sick call request he put in on January 10, 2014.  He put in another sick call request \n3  slip on or around January 12, 2014, following the above-described protocol.   \n4  48.  Mr. Parenti continued coughing up blood that was thick and mucous-\n5  like.  He was not called for sick call January 13 or 14, 2014.   \n6  49.  Early in the morning of January 15, 2014, at approximately 3:45 a.m., \n7  when the Jail provided D-wing inmates breakfast, Mr. Parenti was awake and alert, \n8  and interacting with other inmates.   \n9  50.  At around 9:45 a.m. on January 15, 2014, Defendant Collins stood at \n10  the gate of D-wing, where Mr. Parenti was housed, and called for several inmates to \n11  get dressed to see the nurse, including Mr. Parenti.   \n12  51.  Mr. Parenti was laying on his bunk and did not and could not respond \n13  even after Defendant Collins called his name multiple times.   \n14  52.  At that point, Defendant Collins entered D-wing, went over to Mr. \n15  Parentiโs bunk, and said his name several more times.  Mr. Parenti remained \n16  unresponsive, although he was still breathing in a labored fashion.  Defendant \n17  Collins then repeatedly tapped and/or shook Mr. Parenti, but Mr. Parenti remained \n18  unresponsive.   \n19  53.  Deputy Collins then left D-wing without providing or summoning any \n20  medical attention for Mr. Parenti, despite the clear and apparent need for urgent \n21  medical treatment based on his inability to wake up Mr. Parenti and Mr. Parentiโs \n22  submissions of requests for medical attention.   \n23  54.  Over the next hour, Defendantsโ officers and staff, including Deputy \n24  Collins and medical staff, failed, refused, and/or neglected to provide medical \n25  attention to an inmate in their custody in obvious and serious need of immediate \n26  medical attention. Neither Deputy Collins nor any other jail staff returned to check \n27  on Mr. Parenti or provide him with medical attention. \n28  / / / \n   \n-11- \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-05481-PSG   Document1   Filed12/16/14   Page13 of 22\n \n1  55.  At approximately 10:45 a.m. that same morning, inmates in Mr. \n2  Parentiโs housing unit noticed that he had stopped breathing and his face had a \n3  bluish tint.  Several inmates pulled him down from the bunk and attempted to \n4  resuscitate him while other inmates called โman-downโ and attempted to get the \n5  attention of the deputies in the jail by banging on the gate of the unit.   \n6  56.  After one inmate had already started CPR on Mr. Parenti, deputies \n7  arrived in the unit, followed by Fire Department personnel and nurses.  On \n8  information and belief, the Jail deputies did not attempt CPR on Mr. Parenti.  At \n9  some point after they arrived, medical personnel made some attempt to resuscitate \n10  Mr. Parenti, but this was unsuccessful.  \n11  57.  At 11:05 a.m. on January 15, 2014, Mr. Parenti was pronounced dead. \n12  58.  In the evening of January 15, 2014, Susan Parenti, Mr. Parentiโs \n13  mother, received a phone call from an inmate at Monterey County Jail during which \n14  the inmate informed her that Mr. Parenti had died.  Ms. Parenti had not previously \n15  received any notification of her sonโs death from Monterey County Jail officers or \n16  other employees. \n17  59.  On January 23, 2014, jail staff was quoted in a local newspaper as \n18  saying that Mr. Parenti died of a drug overdose.  On information and belief, at the \n19  time, the County had not yet received results of any toxicology report for Mr. \n20  Parenti nor had the Coronerโs Office completed its autopsy report. \n21  60.  Mr. Parentiโs family raised funds and arranged for an independent \n22  autopsy of Mr. Parentiโs body to be conducted. \n23  61.  On January 24, 2014, the autopsy administrator for the independent \n24  autopsy notified the Coronerโs Office that the family had arranged for an \n25  independent autopsy to be conducted for Mr. Parenti.   \n26  62.  Although the Monterey County Coronerโs Report eventually \n27  concluded that Mr. Parenti died due to acute mixed drug intoxication, toxicology \n28  analysis of Mr. Parentiโs blood does not support this conclusion.  \n   \n-12- \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-05481-PSG   Document1   Filed12/16/14   Page14 of 22\n \n1  63.  Based on the findings of the independent autopsy, Parentiโs death \n2  resulted from viral influenza syndrome complicated by pneumonia.    \n3  64.  At the time of Mr. Parentiโs death, the Monterey County Sheriffโs \n4  Office and CFMG knew there to be a high prevalence of influenza in Monterey \n5  County, including the H1N1 flu virus. \n6  65.  News media reported that the Monterey County Sheriffโs Office \n7  announced that another Monterey County Jail inmate died from influenza-related \n8  complications on or around January 20, 2014.  According to news reports, that \n9  inmate was transferred from the Jail to a local hospital on January 12, 2104, after he \n10  complained of trouble breathing. On information and belief, that inmate had \n11  submitted multiple sick call slips before he finally received medical attention at the \n12  Jail.  \n13  66.  Influenza and pneumonia are treatable medical conditions. \n14  67.  Defendants Monterey County and CFMG did not provide appropriate \n15  medical care to Mr. Parenti despite knowledge of viral influenza at Monterey \n16  County Jail and Mr. Parentiโs self-report of flu-like symptoms.   \n17  68.  With adequate, basic medical treatment, Mr. Parentiโs death would \n18  have been avoided. \n19  69.  Defendants failed to provide appropriate urgent and emergency \n20  medical care to Mr. Parenti, despite his clear and obvious need for such treatment. \n21  70.  Had Defendants, including Defendant Collins, responded appropriately \n22  to Mr. Parentiโs clear need for emergency medical attention on the morning of \n23  January 15, 2104, including seeking and providing such treatment to Mr. Parenti, \n24  his death would have been avoided.   \n25  71.  Mr. Parentiโs family members, including Plaintiffs Susan Parenti and \n26  D.P-O., as well as his sister, Amy Vye, and brother, Americo Parenti, have been \n27  deeply impacted by his untimely death and the circumstances thereof.   \n28  / / / \n   \n-13- \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-05481-PSG   Document1   Filed12/16/14   Page15 of 22\n \n1  72.  Plaintiff Susan Parenti, Mr. Parentiโs mother, continues to experience \n2  emotional distress as a result of Mr. Parentiโs death, the manner of his death, and \n3  the subsequent actions of Defendants, as well as loss of physical support from Mr. \n4  Parenti in performing activities of daily life in the context of her disabilities. \n5  73.  Plaintiff D.P-O. lost his father, with whom he had a significant \n6  relationship before, during, and after the time period during which Mr. Parenti was \n7  D.P-O.โs primary caretaker.  Plaintiff D.P-O. lost both the future emotional and \n8  financial support of Mr. Parenti as a result of Mr. Parentiโs death.  \n9  74.  While Mr. Parenti was housed in D-wing of the Jail, he made a \n10  significant impression on the men housed with him.  They describe him as friendly \n11  and caring, and as a person with a lot of positivity who always had a smile or a joke \n12  to tell if someone was having a bad day. \n13  75.  After Mr. Parentiโs death, some of the men in D-wing made a \n14  memorial for him, including a sketch of Mr. Parenti and a cross, and put it up on the \n15  wall of the Jail dormitory.  However, deputies at the Jail instructed them to remove \n16  the memorial, and withheld television, commissary, and visiting privileges until the \n17  men took down the memorial.   \n \n18 \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n19 \nFirst Claim for Relief \n20 \nDeliberate Indifference to Serious Medical Needs and Failure to Protect from \n21 \nHarm in Violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \n22 \nConstitution of the United States (Survival Action โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n23 \n(Against All Defendants) \n24 \n76.

Defendant Collins failed to respond appropriately to Mr. Parentiโs \n4  emergency medical needs on January 15, 2014. \n5  79.  Defendants County of Monterey, Miller, and CFMG failed to ensure \n6  that appropriate policies, procedures, and practices were in place to guide \n7  Defendant Collins in responding to medical emergencies, and filed to provide \n8  adequate training to Defendant Collins on response to medical emergencies. \n9  80.  In addition to the individual failures enumerated above, Monterey \n10  County, Monterey County Sheriffโs Office, and California Forensic Medical Group \n11  failed to adopt and implement adequate policies, procedures, training, and \n12  supervision to ensure the provision of appropriate medical care and emergency \n13  response in the Jail.   \n14  81.  Monterey County, Monterey County Sheriffโs Office, Deputy Collins, \n15  and other jail staff had a duty to protect Mr. Parenti from harm, and failed to do so.  \n16  82.  Defendants have inadequate policies, procedures, and practices for \n17  identifying inmates in need of medical treatment and providing appropriate medical \n18  treatment. Defendants also fail to appropriately train and supervise staff regarding \n19  the regarding the provision of medical treatment to inmates.  \n20  83.  Defendants have consistently failed to meet their constitutional \n21  obligation to provide adequate medical treatment to prisoners in their jail. \n22  Defendantsโ failure to correct their policies, procedures, and practices, despite \n23  notice of significant and dangerous problems, evidences deliberate indifference in \n24  the provision of medical treatment. \n25  84.  Defendantsโ acts and/or omissions as alleged herein, including but not \n26  limited to their failure to provide Jacob Parenti with appropriate medical care, along \n27  with the acts and/or omissions of the Defendants in failing to train, supervise and/or \n28  promulgate appropriate policies and procedures in order to identify medical need \n   \n-15- \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES \n \n \n \n\nCase5:14-cv-05481-PSG   Document1   Filed12/16/14   Page17 of 22\n \n1  and provide appropriate treatment, constituted deliberate indifference to Jacob \n2  Parentiโs serious medical needs, health and safety. \n3  85.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ conduct, Jacob Parenti \n4  experienced physical pain, emotional distress, and mental anguish, as well as loss \n5  of his life and other damages alleged herein. \n6  86.  The aforementioned acts and/or omissions of Defendants Miller, in his \n7  individual capacity, Collins, CFMG, and Fithian were willful, wanton, malicious, \n8  and oppressive, thereby justifying an award to Plaintiffs of exemplary and punitive \n9  damages to punish the wrongful conduct alleged herein and to deter such conduct in \n10  the future.   \n11  Second Claim for Relief \n12  Deprivation of Substantive Due Process Rights in Violation of First and \n13  Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States โ  \n14  Loss of Parent/Child Relationship (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n15  (Against All Defendants) \n16  87.

The aforementioned acts and/or omissions of Defendants in being \n19  deliberatively indifferent to Jacob Parentiโs serious medical needs, health and \n20  safety, violating Mr. Parentiโs constitutional rights, and their failure to train, \n21  supervise, and/or take other appropriate measures to prevent the acts and/or \n22  omissions that caused the untimely and wrongful death of Jacob Parenti deprived \n23  Plaintiffs Susan Parenti and D.P-O. of their liberty interests in the parent-child \n24  relationship in violation of their substantive due process rights as defined by the \n25  First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \n26  89.

The aforementioned acts and/or omissions of Defendants Miller, in his \n8  individual capacity, Collins, CFMG, and Fithian were willful, wanton, malicious, \n9  and oppressive, thereby justifying an award to Plaintiffs of exemplary and punitive \n10  damages to punish the wrongful conduct alleged herein and to deter such conduct in \n11  the future.   \n12  Sixth Claim for Relief \n13  Wrongful Death โ California Code Civ.

As a direct and proximate result of Defendantsโ wrongful and/or \n22  negligent acts and/or omissions, Plaintiffs incurred expenses for funeral and burial \n23  expenses in an amount to be proved. \n24  110.

Jurisdiction and Service: \n10    a.  Jurisdiction \n11    This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffsโ federal claims pursuant to 28 \n12  U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343, and over Plaintiffsโ state law claim pursuant to 28 \n13  U.S.C. ยง 1367. \n14    b.  Venue \n15    The parties do not anticipate any issues regarding personal jurisdiction or \n16  venue. \n17    c.  Service \n18    All Defendants were personally served with the Complaint herein. \n19  2.  Facts: \n20    a.  Plaintiffsโ Statement \n21  On January 15, 2014, Defendants left Jacob Parenti, a 33 year-old man in \n22  Monterey County Jail for a probation violation, lying unconscious, helpless, and \n23  untreated on his dorm bed to die.  At the time of Jacob Parentiโs death, the Jail was \n24  already the subject of a class action lawsuit regarding systemic failures to provide \n25  adequate medical care.  However, the County, its Sheriff and officers have \n26  stubbornly refused to address these known issues.    \n27    Mr. Parenti began a one-year jail term for a probation violation at Monterey \n28  County Jail on or around August 1, 2013.  On or around January 10, 2014, Mr. \n3 \n \nEstate of Jacob Parenti v. County of Monterey, et al.  Case No.  CV 14-05481-PSG \nJoint Case Management Statement and [Proposed] Order \n\nCase5:14-cv-05481-PSG   Document33   Filed04/21/15   Page4 of 16\n \n1  Parenti developed flu-like symptoms.  He followed the Jailโs procedures for \n2  seeking medical care and put in a written sick call request.  Around the same time \n3  period, Mr. Parenti began coughing up blood.  Mr. Parenti did not receive a \n4  medical appointment in response to the sick call request he put in on January 10, \n5  2014.  He put in another sick call request slip on or around January 12.  Mr. Parenti \n6  continued coughing up blood that was thick and mucous-like.  He was not called \n7  for sick call January 13 or 14.    \n8  At around 9:45 a.m. on January 15, Defendant Collins called for Mr. Parenti \n9  to see the nurse.  Mr. Parenti was laying on his bunk and did not and could not \n10  respond.  Defendant Collins entered D-wing, walked to Mr. Parentiโs bunk, and \n11  said his name several more times.  Mr. Parenti remained unresponsive.  Defendant \n12  Collins then repeatedly tapped and/or shook Mr. Parenti, but Mr. Parenti remained \n13  unresponsive.   \n14  Deputy Collins then left D-wing without providing or summoning \n15  emergency or other medical attention for Mr. Parenti.  Over the next hour, \n16  Defendants failed, refused, and/or neglected to provide medical attention to an \n17  inmate in their custody in obvious and serious need of immediate medical \n18  attention.  \n19  At approximately 10:45 a.m., inmates in Mr. Parentiโs housing unit noticed \n20  that he had stopped breathing and his face had a bluish tint.  Several inmates pulled \n21  him down from the bunk and attempted to resuscitate him while other inmates \n22  attempted to get the attention of the deputies.  After one inmate had already started \n23  CPR on Mr. Parenti, deputies arrived in the unit, followed by Fire Department \n24  personnel and nurses.  On information and belief, the Jail deputies did not attempt \n25  CPR on Mr. Parenti. \n26  At 11:05 a.m. on January 15, 2014, Mr. Parenti was pronounced dead.  \n27  In the evening of January 15, 2014, Susan Parenti, Mr. Parentiโs mother, \n28  received a phone call from an inmate at Monterey County Jail during which the \n4 \n \nEstate of Jacob Parenti v. County of Monterey, et al.  Case No.  CV 14-05481-PSG \nJoint Case Management Statement and [Proposed] Order \n\nCase5:14-cv-05481-PSG   Document33   Filed04/21/15   Page5 of 16\n \n1  inmate informed her that Mr. Parenti had died.  Ms. Parenti had not previously \n2  received any notification of her sonโs death from Defendants. \n3  Although the Monterey County Coronerโs Report eventually concluded that \n4  Mr. Parenti died due to acute mixed drug intoxication, toxicology analysis of Mr. \n5  Parentiโs blood does not support this conclusion.  Based on the findings of the \n6  independent autopsy, Parentiโs death resulted from viral influenza syndrome \n7  complicated by pneumonia, a treatable medical condition.    \n8    b.  Defendants County of Monterey, Sheriff Scott Miller and Officer \n9  Collinsโ Statement \n10    Defendants County of Monterey, Sheriff Scott Miller and Officer Collins \n11  (โCounty Defendantsโ) deny that they singularly or individually caused decedent \n12  Jacob Parentiโs injury or death.   \n13    On July 20, 2013, Jacob Parenti was arrested in the City of Seaside, County \n14  of Monterey, for violation of Vehicle Code 23152(a); under the influence of, and in \n15  possession  of  a  controlled  substance,  receiving  stolen  property,  and  probation \n16  violation.  Parenti pled guilty to various charges and was sentenced to County jail \n17  on August 1, 2013 with a release date of September 18, 2014.  Parenti was housed \n18  in D-Wing on January 15, 2014.  On the morning of January 15, 2014, an inmate in \n19  D-Wing, hearing Parentiโs name called for โmed passโ, attempted to wake him up \n20  as he appeared to be sleeping.  Parenti, in response, waved the inmate off.  The \n21  inmates believed  Parenti  was  sleeping.   Defendant  Collins, when he  contacted \n22  Parenti, was given the same response.  Parenti ate breakfast and nothing unusual \n23  was noted in his appearance or manner. \n24    Parenti was seen in the front area of D-Wing at about 9:15 a.m., as he left \n25  the area and returned to his bunk, as he returned to see a television program he \n26  regularly watched. \n27    Later that morning, various inmates noted that Parenti seemed to be having \n28  trouble breathing.  Various inmates signaled for help and removed Parenti from his \n5 \n \nEstate of Jacob Parenti v. County of Monterey, et al.  Case No.  CV 14-05481-PSG \nJoint Case Management Statement and [Proposed] Order \n\nCase5:14-cv-05481-PSG   Document33   Filed04/21/15   Page6 of 16\n \n1  bunk to the cell floor.  Jail staff responded at about 10:40 a.m. and found Parenti \n2  unresponsive.  Medical staff was called and lifesaving measures were employed.  \n3  Medical staff arrived, assessed Parenti and called for paramedics, who responded \n4  at 11:00 a.m., but Parenti was propounded dead at approximately 11:05 a.m.  The \n5  conclusion of the postmortem examination was that Parenti died from an acute \n6  mixed drug intoxication. \n7    c.  Defendants California Forensic Medical Group, Inc. and Taylor \n8  Fithian, M.D.โs Statement \n9  For his most recent incarceration, Mr. Parenti was booked into the Monterey \n10  County Jail on July 20, 2013.  On intake, he provided a history of heart problems \n11  and anxiety, and reported taking Klonopin, Atenolol, Lisinopril and hydrocodone.  \n12  He was placed on a low sodium diet and blood pressure checks were ordered and \n13  performed daily for five days, then weekly in the hypertension clinic.  Throughout \n14  the remainder of 2013, Mr. Parenti was properly seen and treated by physicians \n15  and staff from CFMG with appropriate medication renewals and adjustments.  Mr. \n16  Parenti was also properly examined and treated by CFMG physicians and staff for \n17  mental health and psychiatric care.  In the fall of 2013, Mr. Parenti complained of a \n18  skin growth under his nose, which was timely evaluated and monitored by CFMG \n19  physicians and staff and plaintiff was referred to an outside dermatologist, Dr. \n20  Friend, in November 2013 for biopsy and treatment, which biopsy was performed \n21  on January 6, 2014 and presumed to represent basal cell carcinoma. \n22  On January 10, 2014 Mr. Parenti submitted a single sick call slip stating \n23  โhave the flu.โ  He was scheduled and seen at sick call on January 13, 2014 at \n24  10:30 a.m. by Maureen Hollcraft.  During this examination, Mr. Parenti reported \n25  he had the flu and his joints were sore.  His vital signs, including temperature, were \n26  normal.  His throat was red, tongue was coated and he had slight swelling in his \n27  nodes.  Ms. Hollcraft assessed an upper respiratory infection and noted she would \n28  be discussing Mr. Parenti with an โM.D.โ (Dr. Garcia), which was done \n6 \n \nEstate of Jacob Parenti v. County of Monterey, et al.  Case No.  CV 14-05481-PSG \nJoint Case Management Statement and [Proposed] Order \n\nCase5:14-cv-05481-PSG   Document33   Filed04/21/15   Page7 of 16\n \n1  approximately one and a half hours later.  Orders were written for a decongestant \n2  (Actifed), cough medicine (Robitussin), and an analgesic (Motrin).   These \n3  medications were begun with the late afternoon pill pass on January 13, 2014. \n4  Subsequently, on January 14, 2014 at 1555, Mr. Parenti was seen for a \n5  mental health examination by Charlotte Gage.  Mr. Parenti was anxious related to \n6  his current basal cell carcinoma diagnosis but his speech was clear and his thought \n7  process was organized.  He requested an increase in his psychiatric medications \n8  and Ms. Gage noted she would discuss the request with Dr. Fithian, which was \n9  done on January 15, 2014 at 0900.   However, at approximately 1045 hours on \n10  January 15, 2014, CFMG staff was summoned to D-wing where custody was \n11  amidst life-saving efforts for Mr. Parenti.   CFMG staff including physician Dr. \n12  Benda continued life-saving efforts and summoned an ambulance but Mr. Parenti \n13  was propounded dead at approximately 11:05 a.m.  The postmortem examination \n14  concluded Mr. Parenti died from an acute mixed drug intoxication. \n15  3.  Legal Issues: \n16    The disputed legal issues include the following: \n17  a.  Whether any Monterey County Defendant or Monterey County \n18  Sheriff custodial officer/employee was subjectively aware that Jacob \n19  Parenti was at a substantial risk of harm and acted with deliberate \n20  indifference. \n21  b.  Whether the actions or omissions of any Monterey County Defendant \n22  or Monterey County Sheriff custodial officer/employee was the \n23  proximate cause of injury to Jacob Parenti or his death. \n24  c.  Whether Defendants and Monterey County Sheriff custodial \n25  officers/employees were properly trained to recognize and react if and \n26  when an inmate is in acute medical distress. \n27  d.  Whether the Monterey County Sheriffโs Officeโs procedures, practices \n28  and policies regarding the welfare/health checks or care of inmates \n7 \n \nEstate of Jacob Parenti v.

Whether Defendants failed to protect Parenti from harm in violation \n13  of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n14  j.  Whether Defendants deprived Plaintiff Susan Parenti and Plaintiff \n15  D.P.-O. of their respective relationships with Jacob Parenti in \n16  violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments \n17  k.  Whether Defendants failed to summon or provide appropriate medical \n18  care in response to Parentiโs alleged need for immediate medical \n19  treatment when he was incarcerated in Monterey. \n20  l.  Whether Defendants were negligent in their supervision, training, and \n21  hiring of individuals responsible for providing adequate medical care \n22  to Parenti. \n23  m.  Whether Defendants are liable for the wrongful death of Parenti. \n24  n.  Whether Defendants were negligent in the provision of medical care \n25  to Parenti during his incarceration in Monterey. \n26  o.  What amount of damages, including compensatory and punitive \n27  damages, should be awarded to Plaintiffs on a finding of liability \n28  against any Defendant(s). \n8 \n \nEstate of Jacob Parenti v.

Whether decedentโs death or Plaintiffsโ claimed damages (or any \n13  portion) were proximately or legally caused by the alleged negligence \n14  or claimed violation of civil rights on the part of each of the \n15  Defendants.  \n16  4.  Motions: \n17    a.  Prior Motions \n18    Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Consider Related Case pursuant to local Rule 3-\n19  12(b) to consider whether this action relates to Hernandez v.

P. 72(b)(2) (deadline for objection is fourteen days after being served \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  with report and recommendation). \n19    The Report and Recommendation addresses Plaintiffsโ motion to exclude two of the non-\n20  retained experts disclosed by Defendants California Forensic Medical Group and Dr. Taylor \n21  Fithian (โCFMG Defendantsโ), which was made as part of a larger motion to exclude heard by this \n22  Court on April 27, 2017.  See Pl.โs Motion to Exclude, ECF 76.  The Court ruled on most aspects \n23  of Plaintiffsโ motion in an order issued May 3, 2017, but it referred to Judge van Keulen the issue \n24  of whether non-retained experts Julie Kelly and Dr. Delmar Greenleaf should be excluded based \n25  on the CFMG Defendantsโ failure to comply with the disclosure requirements of Federal Rule of \n26  Civil Procedure 26.  See Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffsโ Motion to Exclude, \n27  ECF 87.  Judge van Keulen recommends that the Court deny the motion to exclude Kelly and \n28  Greenleaf altogether but limit their trial testimony significantly. \n\nCase 5:14-cv-05481-BLF   Document 92   Filed 06/06/17   Page 2 of 2\n \n1    The Court finds the Report and Recommendation to be correct, well-reasoned, and \n2  thorough.  Specifically, the Court agrees with Judge van Keulen that the CFMG Defendantsโ \n3  disclosures regarding Kelly and Greenleaf do not comply with Rule 26(a)(2)(C) and that the \n4  appropriate remedy is to limit the witnessesโ testimony to the disclosures which were provided.  \n5  See R&R at 4-5, ECF 88.   \n6    Accordingly, the Court: \n7    (1)  ADOPTS the Report and Recommendation in its entirety; and  \n8    (2)  LIMITS the trial testimony of Kelly and Greenleaf as set forth in the Report and  \n9      Recommendation.    \n10   \n11  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n12   \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Dated:   June 6, 2017   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    ______________________________________ \ni\nrts fo BETH LABSON FREEMAN \niD tc 15  United States District Judge \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr\nee 17 \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n2 ",

BACKGROUND1 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Minor D.P-O, by and through his legal guardian Matthew Oberholtz, as an individual and \nS d nr\nee 17  on behalf of the Estate of Jacob Parenti, along with his grandmother Susan Parenti (collectively, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  โPlaintiffsโ), filed this action against Defendants County of Monterey (โCountyโ), Scott Miller, \n19  Officer Collins, California Forensic Medical Group, and Taylor Fithian, M.D., alleging six causes \n20  of action:  (1) deliberate indifference to serious medical needs and failure to protect from harm in \n21  violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983; (2) deprivation of \n22  substantive due process in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, under 42 U.S.C. ยง \n23  1983; (3) failure to furnish or summon medical care, under California state law; (4) negligent \n24  supervision, training, hiring, and retention, under California state law; (5) negligence, under \n25  California state law; and (6) wrongful death, under California Civil Procedure Code ยง 377.60.  See \n26  generally Compl., ECF 1. \n27 \n                                                 \n1 This section is based on allegations made in the Complaint.  The Court accepts these allegations \n28 \nas true for the purposes of ruling on this motion.  \n\n \n1  Susan Parenti is the mother of Jacob Parenti (โMr. Parentiโ).  Id. ยถ 10.  Mr. Parenti lived \n2  with his mother in his youth.  Compl. ยถ 30.  When he was older, he regularly helped his mother, by \n3  doing household chores and acting as her caretaker.  Compl. ยถ 38.  D.P-O is the seven-year-old2 \n4  minor son and sole heir of Mr. Parenti.  Compl. ยถ 8.  After D.P-O was born in 2007, he lived with \n5  his birth mother, but he had an ongoing relationship with Mr. Parenti, who made child support \n6  payments, visited regularly, and brought D.P-O to spend time with Mr. Parentiโs family.  Compl. ยถ \n7  32.  In 2013, Mr. Parenti was awarded primary custody of D.P-O and brought D.P-O to live with \n8  him in Monterey, California.  Compl. ยถยถ 34โ35.  When Mr. Parenti was incarcerated in February \n9  2013 for three months, his cousin, Matthew Oberholtz cared for D.P-O.  Compl. ยถ 36.  Mr. Parenti \n10  began a separate period of incarceration in August 1, 2013 at Monterey County Jail (โJailโ), \n11  during which he kept in regular contact with his son, his mother, and his other family members.  \n12  Compl. ยถยถ 40โ42.   \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Throughout the first few months of his incarceration, Mr. Parenti told his mother that the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Jail was not providing him with his prescribed blood pressure and psychotropic medications.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Compl. ยถ 44.  His mother complained to the Jail many times and even brought his medications to \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  the Jail and gave them to the nurse to ensure that Mr. Parenti received them.  Compl. ยถ 44.  On or \nS d nr\nee 17  around both January 10 and January 12, 2014, Mr. Parenti reported to the staff that he thought he \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  had the flu.  Compl. ยถยถ 45, 47.  He was not called for sick call.  Compl. ยถ 48.  Around January 10, \n19  Mr. Parenti began to cough up blood, and this continued throughout the next few days.  Compl. ยถยถ \n20  46, 48. \n21  On January 15, at breakfast around 3:45 a.m., Mr. Parenti appeared awake and alert.  \n22  Compl. ยถ 49.  At 9:45 a.m., Defendant Collins came to collect several inmates for a nurse visit, but \n23  Mr. Parenti, who was lying on his bunk, could not respond when Defendant Collins called his \n24  name several times.  Compl. ยถยถ 50โ51.  Defendant Collins went to Mr. Parentiโs bunk, said his \n25  name a few more times, and repeatedly tapped and shook him, but Mr. Parenti was unresponsive \n26  and had labored breathing.  Compl. ยถ 52.  Defendant Collins left the cell without summoning help.  \n27 \n                                                 \n28 \n2 The Complaint was filed in 2014.  D.P-O is now approximately 11 years old. \n2 \n\n \n1  Compl. ยถ 53. \n2  An hour later, at approximately 10:45 a.m., Mr. Parentiโs cellmates noticed he had stopped \n3  breathing and his face had a bluish tint.  Compl. ยถ 55.  One inmate started CPR while the others \n4  attempted to call the deputies.  Compl. ยถ 55.  Deputies arrived first but did not attempt CPR; fire \n5  personnel and nurses then arrived and unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate Mr. Parenti.  Compl. \n6  ยถ 56.  At 11:05 a.m., Mr. Parenti was pronounced dead.  Compl. ยถ 57.  Susan Parenti learned of \n7  her sonโs death from an inmate that night.  Compl. ยถ 58. \n8  The Countyโs autopsy concluded that Mr. Parenti had died due to drug intoxication, but an \n9  independent autopsy commissioned by Susan Parenti concluded he had died from viral influenza \n10  syndrome complicated by pneumonia.  Compl. ยถ 63.  At the time of Mr. Parentiโs death, \n11  Defendants knew that Monterey County was experiencing a high rate of influenza.  Compl. ยถ 64.  \n12  Another inmate died from influenza on January 20, 2014, after being taken to the hospital on \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  January 12, 2014.  Compl. ยถ 65.  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants failed to provide appropriate \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  medical care to Mr. Parenti, and this his death has caused substantial damage to Plaintiffs, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  including emotional distress and loss of physical and financial support.  Compl. ยถยถ 66โ73.  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Plaintiffs also allege that the Jail has had a history of providing inadequate medical care to its \nS d nr\nee 17  inmates since at least 2007, and that Defendants knew of these failings.  Compl. ยถยถ 19โ26.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  On December 15, 2014, Plaintiffs initiated this lawsuit against Defendants.  ECF 1.  \n19  Defendants California Forensic Medical Group and Dr. Taylor Fithian were dismissed on October \n20  5, 2017.  ECF 99.  After substantial discovery, resolution of a summary judgment motion, and \n21  motions in limine briefing, the parties reached an agreement resolving the case.  ECF 131, 133.  \n22  II.  LEGAL STANDARD \n23  โDistrict courts have a special duty, derived from Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(c), to \n24  safeguard the interests of litigants who are minors.โ  Robidoux v. Rosengren, 638 F.3d 1177, 1181 \n25  (9th Cir. 2011).  โRule 17(c) provides, in relevant part, that a district court โmust appoint a \nguardian ad litemโor issue another appropriate orderโto protect a minor or incompetent person \n26 \nwho is unrepresented in an action.โโ  Id. (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c)).  โIn the context of \n27 \nproposed settlements in suits involving minor plaintiffs, this special duty requires a district court \n28 \n3 \n\n \n1  to โconduct its own inquiry to determine whether the settlement serves the best interests of the \n2  minor.โโ  Id. (quoting Dacanay v. Mendoza, 573 F.2d 1075, 1080 (9th Cir. 1978)). \n3  In cases involving the settlement of a minorโs federal claims, a district court must consider \nwhether the proposed settlement is fair and reasonable as to each minor plaintiff.  Id. at 1182.  \n4 \nโ[T]he district court should evaluate the fairness of each minor plaintiffโs net recovery without \n5 \nregard to the proportion of the total settlement value designated for adult co-plaintiffs or plaintiffsโ \n6 \ncounselโwhose interests the district court has no special duty to safeguard.โ  Id.  \n7 \nWhile the Robidoux Court expressly limited its holding to settlement of a minorโs federal \n8 \nclaims, โdistrict courts have found the Robidoux rule reasonable in the context of state law claims \n9 \nand have applied the rule to evaluate the propriety of a settlement of a minorโs state law claims as \n10 \nwell.โ  Frary v.
