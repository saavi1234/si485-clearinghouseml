On April 15, 1960, William Pp Henderson,\nExecutive Secretary of the Commission wrote to the\nPublic Health Service stating that project application\nNC-330 had incorrectly stated the intention of the\nMoses Cone 6A4ty Hospital with respect to the\nassurances that the hospital facilities would be\noperated without discrimination because of race,\ncreed, or color. By amendment submitted to the\nSurgeon General and approved by him on April 19, 1960,\nthe Commission and the Moses Cone 6(cid:9) 1ty'Hospital\nwithdrew the non-discrimination assurance previously\ngiven.\n18. Pursuant to the provisions of the State\nplan adopted by the North Carolina Medical Care\nCommission and approved by the Surgeon General, the\nWesley Long Community Hospital submitted project\nnumber NC-311, dated November 16, 1958; project\nnumber NC-353, dated sometimes prior to January 12,\n1961; and project number NC-358, dated February 1,\ni96-t'; all for general hospital construction. The North\nCarolina Medical Care Commission approved all these\nprojects and submitted them to the Surgeon General.\n19. Ou June 30, 1959, the Surgeon General\napproved project NC-311 and authorized the expenditure\nof $1,617,150 as the federal approved share of a total\nproject cost of $3,240,722. On May 15, 1961, the\nSurgeon General approved project NCB-353 and authorized\nthe expenditure of $66,000 as the federally approved\nshare of a total project cost of $120,000. On\n\nDecember 15, 1961, the Surgeon General approved project\nNC-358 and authorized the expenditure of $265,650 as\nthe federal approved share of a total project cost of\n$492,636.\n20, The Wesley Long Community Hospital has not\ngiven assurance that it will operate its facilities\nwithout discrimination because of race, creed or color.\n21. As of the date of the filing of these plead-\nings, the United States has paid to the Treasurer of\nthe State of North Carolina the sum, of $1,229,552,50 on\nprojects NC-86 and NC-330 for the Moses Cone Memorial\nHospital. The facilities for which these funds were\npaid have been constructed and are presently being\nused,\n22, As of the date of the filing of these pleadings,\nthe United States has paid to the Treasurer of North\nCarolina the sum of $1,596,301.60 on projects NC-311 and\nNC-353 for the Wesley Long Community Hospital. The\nfacilities for which these funds have been expended are\nstill under construction as of the date of the filing\nof this pleading,\n23, The Moses Cone Memorial Hospital has refused\nand is presently refusing to admit Negro patients on the\nsame terms and conditions as white patients,\n24, The Wesley Long Community Hospital has refused\nand is refusing to admit Negro patients on the basis of\nrace,\n25, The conduct complained of in paragraphs 23\nand 24 above is authorized by the State plan described\nin paragraph 7 above which was adopted pursuant to the\nAct and the regulations thereunder.\n\n26. The conduct described in paragraphs 23 and\n24 above violates the Fourteenth Amendment of the\nConstitution.\n27. This matter involves an actual controversy\nwhich can \nbe resolved by this Court.\nWHEREFORE, the United States prays that this\nCourt declare that so much of Section 291e(f) of\nTitle 42, U.S.C. as authoriaes.;the Surgeon General to\nprescribe regulations concerning separate hospital\nfacilities for separate population groups is unconsti-\nsuch \ntutional, null and void and prays for  other relief\nas justice may require.\nBURKE MARSHALL\nAssistant Attorney General\nWILLIAM H.

The opinion of this court does not deal with this and indeed shows no awareness of it; \nnor was this argued to the court. Certainly the decision can scarcely be relied on as authority for a proposition not \nconsidered. \n \n19  See, e.g., Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461, 73 S.Ct. 809. 97 L.Ed. 1152 (1953); Marsh v.

Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629, 70 S.Ct. 848, 94 L.Ed. 114 (1950). \n \nRacial discrimination in medical facilities is at least partly responsible for the fact that in North Carolina the rate of \nNegro infant mortality is twice the rate for whites and maternal deaths are five times greater. See ‘Equal Protection \nof the Laws Concerning Medical Care in North Carolina,’ Appendix K (Subcommittee on Medical Care of the North \nCarolina Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights (mimeographed)). \nExclusion of Negro physicians from practice in hospitals on account of their race denies them opportunities for \nprofessional improvement and has discouraged Negro physicians from practicing in the cities of the South.

See 28 \nU.S.C.A. § 2282. If there is state action, as we hold, the validity of the statute is no longer debatable, the recent \ndecisions of the Supreme Court having clearly and uniformly decided against such distinctions as the statute \npermits. When the substantive issue has become so academic, the convening of a three-judge court is not required. \nSee Bailey v. Patterson, 369 U.S. 31, 82 S.Ct. 549, 7 L.Ed.2d 512 (1962). \n \n16 \n \n\n \n \nSimkins v. Moses H.

No such license may be obtained or renewed unless the hospital meets certain maintenance and \noperational standards as prescribed by the Commission. The licensure statute, however, applies to every hospital in \nNorth Carolina, whether or not it ever received Hill-Burton funds. It is altogether comparable to statutes which \nrequire licenses for the practice of medicine and of law and which prescribe minimal standards of training and of \ncompetence. It is comparable to restaurant licensing statutes which prescribe minimal sanitary standards. All of such \nstatutes are designed to protect the public from gross professional incompetence or slovenliness. \nIt bears repeating, however, that the licensing statute applies to all hospitals, those which have received no \nHill-Burton funds as well as to those which have. \n \n7  I  find  no  warrant  for  the  majority’s  statement  that  ‘the  defendant  hospitals  operate  as  integral  parts  of \n  comprehensive joint or intermeshing state and federal plans or programs designed to effect a proper allocation of \navailable medical and hospital resources for the best possible promotion and maintenance of public health.’ The fact \nthat these hospitals exist and operate must be taken into account in determining what, if any, additional hospital \nfacilities are needed in the Greensboro area. Their ‘operation’ is no part, much less integral, of someone else’s plan \nto assist in providing additional hospital facilities in the areas of greatest need. Neither those of us who are well fed \nnor those of us who are underfed may be said reasonably to ‘operate as integral parts’ of a governmental plan to \nmake surplus foods available to indigents. A determination of those of us who are indigent is an essential part of the \nplan, but those whose heads are counted are neither integrally nor otherwise a part of the plan, though those on \none side of the dividing line are its beneficiaries. \n \n8  Minimal operational and maintenance standards are prescribed as a condition of licensing, but the licensing statutes \n  apply to all hospitals without regard to the receipt of Hill-Burton funds.

Ore. 1949).\n2\n\n-3-\nof\nThe Hospital Survey and Construction Act \n1946, Act of August 13, 1946, 60 Stat. 1041 (hereinafter\nreferred to as the Hill-Burton Act), as amended, 42 U.S.C.\n291, et seq., is one of the statutes comprising Title VI\nof the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. Ch. 6 A.,\nsubch, IV. This act established a program of federal grants\nto the states for the construction of public and other non-\n2/\nprofit hospitals.\nThe grants are made available upon approval by\nthe Surgeon General of plans submitted by the states. The\nkey provision -- the one here in question -- provides that\nthe Surgeon General shall by general regulation prescribe:\n(f)(cid:9) That the State plan shall provide\nfor adequate hospital facilities for the\npeople residing in a State, without dis-\ncrimination on account of race, creed, or\ncolor, and shall provide for adequate\nhospital facilities for persons unable to\npay therefor. Such regulation may require\nthat before approval of any application\nfor a hospital or addition to a hospital is\nrecommended by a State agency, assurance\nshall be received by the State from the\napplicant that (1) such hospital or ad-\ndition to a hospital will be made available\nto all persons residing in the territorial\narea of the applicant, without discrimination\n2/(cid:9) The program was originally limited to a period of five\nyears. As amended by the Act of August 14, 1958, 72 Stat.\n616, 42 U.S.C. 291 (d), the program has been extended to\nJune 30, 1964 and annual appropriations of $150 million\nhave been authorized, The statute also has been amended in\nother respects, the major changes being in 1954 when special\ngrant categories were added for diagnostic and treatment\ncenters, chronic disease hospitals, rehabilitation facili-\nties and nursing homes (section 641, et seq.; 42 U.S.0\n291, et seq.).\n\n-4-\non account of race, creed, or color, but an\nexception shall be made in cases where separate\nhospital facilities are provided for separate\npopulation groups, if the plan makes equit-\nable provision on the basis of need for\nfacilities and services of like quality for\neach such group; and (2) there will be made\navailable in each such hospital or addition\nto a hospital a reasonable volume of hospital\nservices to persons unable to pay therefor,\nbut an exception shall be made if such a\nrequirement is not feasible from a financial\nstandpoint.\nPursuant to the provision, the Surgeon General adopted\nthe following pertinent regulations (42 C.F.R. § 53.111,\n53.112):\n§53.111 General. The State plan shall\nprovide for adequate hospital, diagnostic\nor treatment center, rehabilitation facility,\nand nursing home service for the people re-\nsiding in a State without discrimination on\naccount of race, creed, or color, and shall\nprovide for adequate facilities of these\ntypes for persons unable to pay therefor.\n§53„112 Nondiscrimination. Before a\nconstruction application is recommended by\na State agency for approval, the State agency\nshall obtain assurance from the applicant\nthat the facilities to be built with aid\nunder the Act will be made available without\ndiscrimination on account of race, creed, or\ncolor, to all persons residing in the area to\nbe served by that facility. However, in any\narea where separate hospital, diagnostic or\ntreatment center, rehabilitation or nursing\nhome facilities, are provided for separate\npopulation groups, the State agency may waive\nthe requirement of assurance from the con-\nstruction applicant if (a) it finds that the\nplan otherwise makes equitable provision on\nthe basis of need for facilities and services\nof like quality for each such population group\nin the area, and (b) such finding is sub-\nsequently approved by the Surgeon General,.\nFacilities provided under the Federal Act will\nbe considered as making equitable provision\nfor separate population groups when the\nfacilities to be built for the group less\nwell provided for heretofore are equal to\nthe proportion of such group in the total\npopulation of the area, except that the\nState plan shall not program facilities for\na separate population group for construction\nbeyond the level of adequacy for such group.\nA State, to participate in the program, is re-\nquired to submit for approval by the Surgeon General a state\nplan setting forth a \"hospital construction program\" which,\n4\n\n-5-\namong other things, \"meets the requirements as to lack\nof discrimination on account of race, creed,or color,\nrequired by the regulations prescribed under section\n291e(f). . . .\" (42 U.S.C. 291f(a)(4). The state may\nmeet this non-discrimination requirement \"in any area\nwhere separate hospital, dia-i!ostic or treatment center,\nrehabilitation or nursing home facilities, are provided\nfor separate population groups . • . if . . . the plan\notherwise makes equitable provision on the basis of need\nfor facilities and services of like quality for each such\npopulation group in the area, and. • . such finding is\nsubsequently approved by the Surgeon General.\" (Regulation\n52.112, 42 C, F. R., 53.112). !there a separate-but-equal\nplan is in operation, the individual applicant for aid need\nnot give any assurance that it will not discriminate and,\nin fact, expressly indicates on its application form that\n\"certain persons in this area will be denied admission to\nthe proposed facilities as patients because of race, creed,\n3/\nor color.\" (cid:9) The arrangement to extend aid is formally cone:\ncluded by a memorandum of agreement signed by representatives\nof the applicant, the state agency and the Surgeon General.\n3/(cid:9) There are, however, a multitude of requirements\nthat an applicant must meet to be approved by the state\nagency. For example, in approving any application the\nstate agency is required by regulation (42 C.F.R. 53.127(d))\nto certify that the application contains reasonable\nassurances as to title, payment of prevailing rates of\nwages, and financial support for the construction and\noperation of the project; that the plans and specifications\nfor construction of the project are in accord with the minimum\nconstruction standards in the Federal regulations; that the\napplication is in conformity with the State plan; that the\napplication contains an assurance that the applicant will\nconform to the requirements of sections 53.111. 53.112, and\n53.113 of the Regulations regarding the provision of facilities\nfor persons unable to pay therefore; that the application\ncontains an assurance that the applicant will conform to state\nstandards for operation and maintenance and to all appli-\ncable state laws and state and local regulations; that the\napplication is entitled to priority over other projects\nwithin the state; and that the state agency has approved the\napplication.\n\n-6-\nB.(cid:9) The Allegations of the Pleadings\nThe allegations of the complaint and of the\npleading in intervention may be summarized as follows:\nIn September 1946, the State of North Carolina,\nacting through the North Carolina i;edical Care Commission,\nfiled with the Public Health Service an application, pur-\nsuant to the Act, for federal funds to conduct a survey,\nof existing hospital and related facilities in North\nCarolina. The application was approved and, following an\nallotment of funds to the State, the North Carolina Medical\nCare Commission filed a state plan with the Public Health\nService. This plan was approved by the Surgeon 'General on\nJuly 8, 1947, and, with periodic revisions, has remained in\neffect to the time of the filing of the pleading in inter-\nvention.\nThe State plan provides for the division of\nGuilford County, North Carolina into two Hospital service\nareas, the Greensboro Hospital Service area and the High\nPoint Hospital service area. Greensboro is one of several\nhospital service areas where, pursuant to the State plan as\napproved by the Surgeon General, separate hospital facili-\nties are provided for separate population groups.\nPlaintiffs are Negro citizens of the United States\nand the State of North Carolina residing in the City of\nGreensboro. Certain of the plaintiffs are qualified medical\ndoctors and certain others are qualified dentists, all practic-\nini in Greensboro. This group of plaintiffs seeks admission\nto the staff facilities of Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital\nand Uesley Long Community Hospital.\nPlaintiffs A. J. Taylor and Donald R, Lyons are\nin need of medical treatment and desire to enter either the\n\n7\nWesley Lon- Community Hospital or the Moses H. Cone\nMemorial Hospital where complete medical equipment and\nthe best facilities for treatment in the Greensboro area\nare available. Plaintiffs also desire treatment from\ntheir personal physicians. Plaintiffs, however, cannot\nbe admitted to the Long Hospital since it follows a\npolicy, practice, custom and usage of refusing to admit\nNegroes to the use of its facilities. Plaintiffs cannot\nenter the Cone Hospital on the same basis as whites nor\ncan they enter the Cone Hospital and be treated by their\npersonal physicians because the Cone Hospital will not\nadmit Negro doctors or dentists to staff facilities.\nDefendants, Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, Inc.,\nand ?lesley Lon-- Community Hospital Inc., are North Carolina\ncorporations that have established and now maintain in\nGreensboro, North Carolina, the Noses H.

United States, 196 U.S\n10/\n283, 295 (1905).(cid:9) However, we believe that if the Court\nconcludes that the conduct of the defendants is subject\nto constitutional limitations, it will, of necessity, be\nrequired to pass on the constitutionality of the separate-\nbut-equal provisions of the Hill-Burton Act. It is that\nAct which expressly sanctions the defendants' conduct, and\nit is that Act which expressly authorized the State of North\nCarolina to devise a hospital construction plan that dis-\ncriminates on the basis of race, in violation of the Four-\nteenth Amendment, jhere unlawful conduct appears to be ex-\npressly authorized by a statutory provision, we do not\nbelieve that, when the conduct is attacked, the Court can\navoid adjudicating the constitutionality of the provision\ninvolved.\n10/(cid:9) Cases are collected in the opinion of I,Ir. Justice\nBrandeis in Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority,\n297 U.S. 288, 345 et seq. (1936). See also United States\nv. Auto T!orkers, 352 U.S. 567, 589-593 (1957).\n\n- 13 -\nB.(cid:9) The Provision of the Hill-Burton Act\nSanctioninc; the Construction of\nSeparate-But-Equal Hospital\nFacilities is Unconstitutional\nThis case raises the question of whether the\nConstitution permits Congress to authorize expressly the\n\"separate-but-equal\" treatment of different racial groups\nin federal-state programs. The United States takes the\nposition that the Constitution does not condone such\ntreatment and that the \"separate-but-equal\" provisions of\nthe Hill-Burton Act are violative of the Fifth Amendment,\nand the action of a state in administering a \"separate-\nbut-equal\" hospital construction program is impermissible\nunder the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nIn the Hill-Burton Act, Congress has authorized\nfederal-state cooperation in a federally financed, state\nadministered program of hospital construction for the\nbenefit of all the people (42 U.S.C. 291(a)). Although\nthe Act specifically provides that state hospital construction\nprograms shall not discriminate \"on account of race, creed\nor color\", Congress has further prescribed that this non-\n-iscrimination standard may be met if the state program\nprovides for the construction of \"separate-but-equal\"\nfacilities. Thus, the Hill-Burton Act is not merely\nneutral or silent on the question of racia?. discrimination.\nRather, Congress incorporated into the statute a standard\nbased on race and has authorized and sanctioned racial\ndiscrimination by state-connected institutions -- racial\ndiscrimination that clearly violates the Fourteenth Amendment.\nCongress has no power, under the Fifth Amendment, to do this.\nFirst, section 29le(f) of Title 42 is, on its\nface, violative of the Constitution. That our Constitution\nprohibits the utilization of race as a yardstick in any\n\n- 14 -\ntype of governmental activity is now too well established\nto be questioned. Racial classifications are \"obviously\n11\nirrelevant and invidious.\" This principle was succinctly\nstated by Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting in Plessy v.\nFerguson, 163 U.S. 537, 559 (1896):\nOur Constitution is color-blind, and neither\nknows nor tolerates classes among citizens.\n* * * The law regards man as man, and takes\nno account of his surroundings or of his color\nwhen his civil rights as guaranteed by the\nsupreme law of the sand are involved. * * *\nSecond, the Hill-Burton Act expressly sanctions\nracial discrimination by state-connected institutions.\nIt is now beyond question that racial discrimination by\na state runs afoul of the Constitution since, \"for a\nstate to place its authority behind discriminatory treatment\nbased solely on color is indubitably a denial by a State\nof the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the\n12/\nFourteenth Amendment.\"(cid:9) Nevertheless, despite this clear\nprinciple, under the Act, the states are expressly authorized\nto devise hospital construction programs that provide separate\nfacilities for the races. The state program must be approved\nby the Surgeon General and he must determine whether the\nstate properly has applied the separate-but-equal formula.\nIn effect, therefore, the federal government takes a very\ndirect part in cooperating with the states in the effectuation\nof a separate-but-equal hospital pro-ram. This is state\nsponsored racial discrimination,w:ith a federal imprimatur.\n11/ Steele v. Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co.,\n323 U.S. 192, 203 (1944).\n12/ Mr. Justice Frankfurter, dissenting on other grounds\nin Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715,\n727 (1961).\n\n- 15 -\nFor Congress expressly to authorize such a scheme necessarily\n13/\nviolates the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\nCertainly, Congress has power to promote hospital construction,\nbut it cannot use that power \"to attain an unconstitutional\nresult.\" Uester.n Union Telegraph Co, v. Foster,(cid:9) 2447 U.S.\n105, 114 (1918). Cf, Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339\n(1960). With respect to a related field of federal activity,\nthe Supreme Court has said (United States v. Butler, 297 U.S.\n1, 74 (1936)):\nit is said that no one has doubted the\npower of Congress to stipulate the sort of\neducation for which money shall be expended.\n13/ In Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S, 497 (1954) the Court\nindicated that, with respect to racial discrimination, the\nreach of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment was\ncoextensive with that of the equal protection clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. The Court said (347 U.S. at 500):\n\"In view of our decision that the Constitution pro-\nhibits the states from maintaining racially segregated public\nschools, it would be unthinkable that the same Constitution\nwould impose a lesser duty on the Federal Government. We\nhold that racial segregation in the public schools of the\nDistrict of Columbia is a denial of the due process of law\nguaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\"\na \nSee also Steele v. Louisville  Nashville R.R. Co., 323 U.S\n192 (1944) where Justice Murphy, in a concurring opinion,\nstated (323 U.S. at 208):\n\"The Act [the Railway Labor Act] contains no\nlanguage which directs the manner in which the bargaining\nrepresentative shall perform his duties. But it cannot be\nassumed that Congress meant to authorize the representative\nto act so as to ignore rights guaranteed by the Constitution_.\nOtherwise the act would bear the stigma of unconstitutionality\n.render the Fifth Amendment i * this respect.\" Cf.\nu°flurd v. Hodge, 334 U.S. 24 (1948).\n\n-16 -\nBut an appropriation to an educational in-\nstitution which by its terms is to become\navailable only if the beneficiary enteres into\na contract to teach doctrines subversive to the\nConstitution is clearly bad. An affirmance of\nthe authority of Congress so to condition the\nexpenditure of an appropriation would tend to\nnullify all constitutional limitations upon\nlegislative power.\"\nThus, Congress may not enact legislation which\nexpressly sanctions state violations of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, for to do so is \"to attain an unconstitutional\n14/\nresult.\"\n1oreover, it is without significance that the\nHill-Burton Act does vot compel the states to devise\nseparate-but-equal hospital construction programs. It\nis enough that racial discrimination is permitted or\nsanctioned. Thus, the Kansas statute involved in Brown v.\nBoard of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954) permitted, but did\nnot require, cities of more than 15,000 population to main-\ntamn separate school facilities for Negro and white studenls.\n14/ In A4ing v. Horgan, 3 R.R.L. Rep. 693, 699 (Cal, Super. Ct.\n1958) the court held that private persons who accepted federal\nmortgage guarantees were bound by the Fifth Amendment. With\nregard to the absence of an explicit non-discrimination pro-\nvision in the act of Congress in issue, the court said:\nIf it be objected that Congress refused to so\nso ordain, it must be replied that Congress could\nnot ordain otherwise -- the law does not permit\nit to differentiate between races, and whether it\nexpresses that limitation in so many words or\nnot • . . .\n15/ Cf. McCabe v. Atchison, T, C\"> S.F. fly. Co„ 235 U.S.\n151 (1914) where the Supreme Court said that a statute was\n:invalid which affirmatively permitted, though it did not\nrequire, a railroad to provide unequal transportation\nfacilities for whites and Negroes.\n\n-' 17 -\nNor is it significant that the state plan involved in\nthis case does not cd(cid:9) ± individual hospitals to\ndiscriminate. The actions of the State of North Carolina\nin this case are sufficient to meet the tests of unconsti-\ntutional state action as set forth in Cooper v. Aaron,\n358 U.S. 1, 19 (1958) where the Court said:\n\"(cid:9) State support of segregated schools through\nany arrangement, management, funds, or property\ncannotbe squared with the [Fourteenth] Amendment's\ncommand that no State shall deny to any person\nwithin its ,jurisdiction the equal protection of\n:he laws. The right of a student not to be\nsegregated on racial grounds in schools so main-\ntained is indeed so fundamental and pervasive\nthat it is embraced in the concept of due process 16/\nof law. trolling v. Sharpe, 347.\" (Emphasis added\n See Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S.\n715. 725 (1961) where the Court held that a State cannot\navoid its responsibilities under the Fourteenth Amendment\nby entering into leasing arrangements and said:\n\"?hut no State may effectively abdicate its\nresponsibilities by either ignoring them or by\nmerely failing to discharge them whatever the\nmotive may be. It is of no consolation to an\nindividual denied the equal protection of the\nlaws that it was done in good faith . . . By\nits inaction, the Authority, and through it\nthe State, has not only made itself a party to\nthe refusal of service, but has elected to place\nits power, property and prestige, behind the\nadmitted discrimination, (Emphasis added).

United States, 189 F. 2d 476 (C.A. 5, 1951).\n\n- 18-\nNor cars the constitutionality of the separate-\nbut-equal provisions of 42 U.S.C. 291e(f) and Regulation\n53.112 and the hospital construction plan of the State of\nNorth Carolina be sustained on the ground that they do not\ndiscriminate against any race but expressly provide for\nseparate but equal treatment. While no case has been\nfound which specifically holds that state aided hospitals\n17/\nmay not be operated on a separate but equal basis, (cid:9) it\nis clear that the separate but equal doctrine has been\nthoroughly repudiated and may no longer be applied. That\ndoctrine had its birth prior to the adoption of the\nFourteenth Amendment in the decision of a Massachusetts\nState Court relating to public schools. Robert v. City of\nBoston, 59 Mass. 198 (1849). The doctrine of that case was\nfollowed in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896) where\nthe Supreme Court held as to intrastate commerce that a\nLouisiana statute, requiring railway companies to provide\nequal but separate accommodations for the white and colored\nraces was not in conflict with the provisions of the\nFourteenth Amendment.\nHowever, in Morgan v. Virginia, 328 U.S. 373\n(1946) the Court held that a state statute requiring\nsegregated seats for Negro passengers on interstate buses\nwas an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.\nIn Henderson v. United States, 339 U.S. 816 (1950), the\nCourt held that interstate railroad regulations and\n17/ Greenberg, Race Relations and American Law 90 offers\nthis explanation for the few cases dealing with hospital\nsegregation: \"But a paucity of cases on the duty of\nhospitals with respect to race probably stems from the\nfact that persons requiring hospitalization usually are\nin no position to litigate. They have to care for their\nillnesses where and as soon as they can; potential litiga-\ntion then becomes moot.\"\n\n- 19 -\npractices assigning a separate table in a dining car to\nNegroes contravened the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.\n81 et seq. The Court referred to the statutory right as\n\"a fundamental right of equality of treatment,\" and cited\ncases construing the Fourteenth Amendment, id at 825,\nthough the Court did not reach the constitutional question.\nThe reasoning applied was similar to that employed in\nShelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 22 (1948) where the Court\nrecognized that the underlying philosophy of the Fourteenth\nAmendment is the equality before the law of each individual.\nSee also Bailey v.

In addi-\ntion, Cone Hospital cooperates with tax supported public\ncolleges and universities of North Carolina in a nurses\ntraining program.\nThe Fourteenth Amendment's applicability to\nthis case does not depend upon whether each of the varied\naspects of state involvement are alone sufficient to\nsatisfy the \"state action\" requirements of that Amendment.\nRather, state involvement must be viewed as a totality --\nas the sum of various related activities. Here, we believe,\nthe state \"has so far insinuated itself into a position\n23/ Long Hospital has been authorized to receive almost\ntwo million dollars in public monies -- fifty percent of\nits construction requirements. Cone Hospital has been\nauthorized to receive over a million dollars in public\nmonies -- fifteen percent of its construction requirements.\n\n- 24 -\n24/\nof interdependence with\" the defendant hospitals that\naccess to the hospitals x- both as staff members and\npatients -- must be accorded without racial discrimina-\ntion. Indeed, we think it plain that the prohibitions\nof the Fourteenth Amendment have been held binding in\nsituations where state participation might be deemed less\ndirect and substantial than it is here.\nOnly recently, the Supreme Court had before it\nthe problem of determining whether the state had become\nso involved in private conduct as to make the action of\nprivate individuals subject to the Fourteenth Amendment.\nIn holding that a private restaurant operating in a public\nbuilding under a lease from a public authority could not\nengage in racial discrimination, the Court noted (Burton\nv. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715, 722 (1961):\nOnly by sifting facts and weighing\ncircumstances can the nonobvious involve-\nment of the State in private conduct be\nattributed its true significance. 25/\n24/ Burton v, [Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715,\n725 (1962).\n25/ Even before Burton there was a large body of case law\nwhich proscribed discrimination by a lessee of public\nproperty or facilities. See Muir v. Louisville Park\nTheatrical Association, 347 U,S, 971 (1954), vacating and\nremanding, 202 F. 2d 275 (C.A. 6, 1953) (leased open air\ntheater); Aaron v, Cooper, 261 F. 2d 97 (C.A. 8, 1958)\n(leased school); City of Greensboro v. Simkins, 246 F. 2d\n425 (C.A. 4, 1957), affirming, 149 F. Supp, 562 (M.D.\nN.C. 1957) (leased golf course); Derrington v. Plummer,\n240 F. 2d 922 (C,A. 5, 1956), cert. denied, 353 U.S. 924\n(1957) (leased cafeteria); Coke V. City of Atlanta, 184\nF. Supp. 579 (N.D. Ga. 1960) (leased airport restaurant);\nJones v. Marva Theatres, 180 F. Supp. 49 (D. Md. 1960)\n(leased motion picture theatre); Tate v„ Department of\nConservation, 133 F. Supp. 53 (E.D.

Va. 1949) (leased airport restaurant);\nLawrence v. Hancock, 76 F. Supp. 1004 (S.D. U. Va. 1948)\n(leased swimming pool). Although these decisions are\nrested on various grounds -- in some, that the lease was\na technique of evading state responsibility; in others,\nthat the property, though privately operated, was being\nused for a public purpose -- they have been uniform in\nreaching the conclusion that the discrimination effectuated\nby the private lessee was constitutionally forbidden.\n\n- 25 -\nIn many other areas the courts have also sifted\nfacts and weighed circumstances so as not to permit con-\nduct to escape the fall-out of the Fourteenth Amendment\nmerely by sheltering under the cloak of \"private action.\"\nThus, in the Girard College Case, Pennsylvania v. Board\nof Directors of City Trusts, 353 U.S. 230 (1957), the\ndiscrimination (in that case, against Negro applicants\nfor admission to Girard College) stemmed from the fact\nthat an individual had placed :Limitations upon the use\nof monies which he had placed in a private trust. A state\nagency was involved in the matter as trustee, i.e., it\nwas engaged in carrying out the trust in accordance with\nits terms. The Supreme Court nevertheless concluded that\nthe action of the trustee was \"discrimination by the State\"\n(353 U.S. at 231). This case thus illustrates the general\nprinciple that what is material and decisive, for pur-\nposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, is that the state\n26/\nhas chosen to place its power behind the discrimination.\nIf a state cannot participate in the administration of\na private trust which draws racial distinctions, as the\nGirard case holds, it follows, we believe, that it cannot\nparticipate in a vast hospital program which involves\ndiscrimination on the basis of race.\nThere are also other instances in which osten-\nsibly private actions have been found to have sufficient\nnexus with governmental action to justify use of the\n26/ \",(cid:9)  ,  Under some circumstances state contact, con-\ntrol and encouragement may be so intimately fused with\nthe activities of a private group or individual in the\nperformance of a public function that it seems fair to\ncall the activity 'state action' . . , ,\" Shanks,\n\"State Action\" and the Girard Estate Case, 105 U, of Pa.\nL.

Howard, 343 U,S, 763, 774 (1952) the Supreme\nCourt said:\nBargaining agents who enjoy the advantages\nof the Railway Labor Act's provisions must\nexecute their trust without lawless invasions\nof the rights of other workers„ 30/\nAnd in Railway Employers' Dept, v Hanson, 351 U.S. 225\n(1956), the Court emphasized the consequences of conduct\nundertaken pursuant to federal law. There the respondents\ncontended, inter alia, that union shop agreements, speci-\nfically permitted by the Railway Labor Act, operated to\ndeprive them of rights secured by the First and Fifth\nAmendments. In the course of its opinion holding that\nno rights were infringed upon, the Court said (351 U.S.\nat 232):\nIf private rights are being invaded, it\nis by force of an agreement made pursuant to\nfederal law which expressly declares that\nstate law is superseded. „ • • In other\nwords, the federal statute is the source of\nthe power and authority by which any private\nrights are lost or sacrificed. . • . The\nenactment of the federal statute authorizing\nunion shop agreements is the governmental\naction on which the Constitution operates,\nthough it takes a private agreement to in-\nvoke the federal sanction.\n30/ See also Syres v.

Board of\nManagers of James Ualker Memorial Hospital, 261 F. 2d\n251 (C,A, 4, 1958), cert. denied, 359 U.S. 984 (1959)\nrequires a conclusion in this case contrary to that\nsuggested by the cases discussed above. The elements\nof state contact in the Eaton case were far less per-\nvasive than they are here. For example:\n1,(cid:9) In Eaton, none of the members of the\nBoard of Managers of James i''alher F.temorial Hospital were\n31,\nappointed by governmential agencies;(cid:9) here, seven of\nthe fifteen members of the Board of Trustees of Cone\nHospital are appointed by governmental or quasi-governmental\nbodies, a factor especially significan±:. in the light of the\nSupreme Court's decision in Pennsylvania v. Board of Directors\nof City Trusts, supra.\n2. Ualker Hospital did not participate in an\narrangement with tax supported public colleges and uni-\nversities of the State of North Carolina for the training\nof nurses, as does Cone Hospital.\n3. In Eaton, all governmental aid and assistance\nin the construction of facilities and the acquisition of\nproperty ended in 1901; here substantial assistance\ncontinues to this day.\n31/ This factor was expressly noted by the district\ncourt which said (164 F. Supra, 191, 193 (E.D. N.C. 1958)):\n\". • . no member of the City or County government is now\na member of the Board or in any way in charge of the\naffairs of James Ualker 2iemorial Hospital.\"\n\n- 29 -\n4. In Eaton, the revenues derived from\ngovernmental sources in the six years preceeding the\nlaw suit amounted to 4.5 per cent of the hospitals\ntotal income; here, the Long Hospital has been authorized\nto receive almost $2,000,000.00 in public monies-about\n50% of its construction requirements, while Cone hospital\nhas been authorized to receive over $1,000,000.00 in\npublic monies - about 15% of its construction requirements.\n5. But the most significant distinction be-\ntween the Eaton case and the present case is the total\nabsence in the former of any discussion or analysis of\nthe relationship between \"alker Hospital and the Hill-Burton\n2/\nhospital program.(cid:9) In this respect, the present case presents\nan entirely different picture. The Cone and Long hospitals\nhave been involved in a state plan designed to develop\nprograms of hospital construction to make possible adequate\nservices to all people. These hospitals affirmatively chose\nto participate in this state program. They applied for\nIn fact, James i''alker I emorial Hospital has not received\nfinancial assistance under the Hill-urton Act. See Hospital\nand Medical Facilities Project Register, (December 31, 1961)\npublished by the Public Health Service Division of Health\nand Medical Facilities.\n\n-- 30 -\nfinancial assistance and, as a condition for receiving\nsuch assistance, gave numerous assurances to the State\n33/\nand to the Surgeon General. These assurances, and the\nconcomitant obligations arising from the receipt of large\namounts of federal aid, removed the almost unlimited freedom\nof management that was present in the Eaton case. Here also\nthe discriminatory policy attacked is one expressly sanctioned\nby federal law and abetted by state planning. Certainly,\nthrough the Hill-Burton Act, governmental power and authority\nhas sufficiently insinuated itself into the affairs of the\ndefendant hospitals as to provide a decisive distinction\n34/\nfrom the Eaton case.\n33/ For example, tine defendant hospitals have given assurances\nthat they will accept indigent patients, thus carrying out a\npublic obligation. In Eaton, indigent patients were treated\nmerely on a contract basis.\n34/ Even in Eaton, the district court recognized that every\ncase must be evaluated on its own terms. Thus, the court said\n(164 F. Supp. at 196): \"when considering the ability to con-\ntrol, it must be noted that it is a composite of elements, :nor\nthere are as many elements of 'control as there are qualities.\nand quanties in the controlled subject,. The elements must re\nviewed in their relationship to each other and as part of a\nsum total, and for this reason each case must be viewed on\nits• rlerits.\"\n\nl\n- 31 -\nFinally, while we believe that the involvement\nof governmental power and authority in the defendants'\nactivities is sufficient to require the defendant hos-\npitals to conform to the commands of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, we are also persuaded that where, as here,\nan institution is of a public nature, affecting the\ncommunity at large, such an institution is \"a public\nfacility in which there can be no more discrimination\nbased on race than is constitutionally permissible in\nthe more customary types of public facility.\" (Mr.\nJustice Douglas concurring in Garner v. Louisiana, 368\nU.S. 157, 183 (1961)). Courts have long recognized that\nrestrictions properly could be placed on activities\naffected with a public interest. See Munn v. Illinois,\n94 U.S. 113 (1876); Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502\n(1934); Marsh v. Alabama, supra; Boman v. Birmingham\n35/\nTransit Co., 280 F. 2d 531 (C.A. 5, 1960).(cid:9) In the Garner\ncase, supra, Mr. Justice Douglas, in a concurring opinion,\nconcluded that such restrictions should be extended to\n36/\na retail establishment under permit from a municipality.\n35/ Lord Chief Justice Hale stated in De Portibus Maris,\nI Harg. Law Tracts 78, \". . . if a man set out a street\nin new building on his land, it is now no longer bare\nprivate interest, but is affected with a public interest.\"\n36/ Mr. Justice Douglas relied heavily on the fact that\nthe retail establishments were licensed by the state (as\nare the hospitals in this case). He wrote (Garner v.\nLouisiana, supra at 184-85):\nI do not believe that a State that\nlicenses a business can license it to serve\nonly whites or only blacks or only yellows\nor only browns. Race is an impermissible\nclassification when it comes to parks or\nother municipal facilities by reason of\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment. By the same token, I\ndo not see how a State can constitutionally\nexercise its licensing power over business\neither in terms or in effect to segregate\nthe races in the licensed premises. The\n(continued)\n\nJ\n— 32 —\nIt is particularly appropriate to view a non-\nprofit hospital as an institution affected with a public\ninterest, As the memorandum of the General Counsel of\nthe Department of Health, Education and Welfare (attached\nhereto as an appendix) reveals, non—profit hospitals\nhave a decidedly public character. This memorandum\n36/(cid:9) (continued)\nauthority to license a business for public\nuse is derived from the public. Negroes\nare as much a part of that public as are\nwhites. A municipality granting a license\nto operate a business for the public repre-\nsents Negroes as well as all other races\nwho live there. A license to establish\na restaur:a±' '.s °a licene , to establish a\npublic facility and necessarily imports, in\nlaw, equality of use for all members of the\npublic, I see no way whereby licenses\nissued by a State tot. serve the public can\nbe distinguished from leases of public\nfacilities (Burton v, Wilmington Parking\nAuthority, supra) for that end.\nOne can close the doors of his home to\nanyone he desires. But one who operates\nan enterprise under-.a license from the\ngovernment enjoys a privilege that derives\nfrom the people. Whether retail stores,\nnot licensed by the municipality, stand\non a different footing is not presented\nhere, But the necessity of a license\nshows that the public has rights in respect\nto those premises. The business is not\na matter of mere private concern, Those\nwho license enterprises for public use\nshould not have under our Constitution\nthe power to license it for the use of\nonly one race. For there is the over-\nriding constitutional requirement that\nall state power be exercised so as not\nto deny equal protection to any group.\nAs the first Mr. Justice Harlan stated\nin dissent in P lessy v. Ferguson, supra,\nat 559, \". • • in view of the Constitution,\nin the eye of the law, there is in this\ncountry no superior, dominant, ruling\nclass of citizens. There is no caste\nhere. Our constitution is color blind\ntt\n\n- 33 -\nindicates that while there are 2,276 accredited private\nnon-profit hospitals in the United States, there are\nonly 524 governmental and 154 proprietary (profit-\nmaking) accredited hospitals. The governmental hospitals\n\"differ little from private non-profit hospitals except\nin the manner of selection of the governing boards,\nand sometimes in having a call upon tax funds to meet\ndeficits.\" Both governmental and non-profit hospitals\nserve as general community hospitals. Such \"community\nhospitals have become essential, both to provide hospi-\ntal service to the people of the community and to enable\nits physicians to practice good medicine.\" Hence non-\nprofit hospitals perform a vital function which would\notherwise have to be performed by the state. It is not,\ntherefore, inappropriate to include such hospitals\n371\nwithin the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment. Only\nrecently a court suggested that schools and colleges,\n\"no matter how 'private' they may claim to be,\" are\nso affected with the public interest as to be bound by\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, in Guillory v. Adminis-\ntrators of Tulane University, 30 L.W. 2469 (E.D. La.,\n1962), the court said:\n37/ Here the State of North Carolina has chosen to make\nadequate hospital service available to all of its people\nby designating, throughout the State, public and private\nnon-profit hospitals as recipients of federal aid. The\ndefendant hospitals are among those designated, and are\nthus among the instrumentalities selected by the State\nfor the effectuation of its purpose -- a purpose that\nincludes, \nand must include, Negroes on the same terms\nas whites. Before the Brown decision, North Carolina\nwas free to achieve its purpose through separate insti-\ntutions for the two races; today, plainly it is not.\nUnder no circumstances, however, do we believe that the\nFourteenth Amendment permits a state, through the device\nof using private institutions to discharge a public func-\ntion, to relieve itself or the institutions of such re-\nsponsibility as is cast upon a state by the Equal Protection\nClause. Today, that responsibility is incompatible with\nracial segregation.\n\n– 34\nAt the outset, one may question whether\nany school or college can ever be so 'private'\nas to escape the reach of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. In a country dedicated to the\ncreed that education is the only 'Sutd\nfoundation * * *of freedom,' 'withotit\nwhich no republic can maintain itself in\nstrength,' institutions of learning\nare not things of purely private concern.\nNo one any longer doubts that education is\na matter affected with the public interest.\nAnd this is true whether it is offered by a\npublic or private institution. . . . Clearly,\nthe administrators of a private college are\nperforming a public function. They do the\nwort, of the state, often in the place of the\nstate. Does it not follow that they stand\nin the state's shoes? And, if so, are they\nnot then agents of the state, subject to the\nconstitutional restraints on governmental\naction, to the same extent as private persons\nwho zovern a company town, Marsh v. Alabama,\n326 U.S. 501, or control a political party,\nTei;-y v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461, or run a city street\ncar and bus service, Public Utilities Comm'n.\nv. Pollak, 343 U.S. 451; Doman v.

Morgan, 5 Cir., 287 F. 2d 750,\n29 L.JC.(cid:9) 2389?\nReason and authority strongly suggest that\nthe Constitution never sanctions racial dis-\ncrimination in our schools and colleges, no\nmatter how 'private' they may claim to be.\nSinilarly ; we believe that the Constitution forbids\nnon—profit hospitals, serving such essential and far reaching\ncommunity needs, to be infected with the virus of racial\ndiscrimination.\nRespectfully submitted,\nBURglE MARSHALL,\nAssistant Attorney General.\n_Tilliam H.

The American Hospital\nAssociation listing for 1960 shows nonfederal short-term\ngeneral (and \"other special\"*) hospitals divided as follows:\nInstitutions Beds\nGovernmental(cid:9) (Listed 1,260(cid:9) 156,000\n(Accredited** 524(cid:9) 121,000\nPrivate nonprofit\n(Listed 3,291(cid:9) 446,000\n(Accredited 2,276(cid:9) 403,000\nProprietary(cid:9) (Listed(cid:9) 856(cid:9) 37,000\n(Accredited(cid:9) 154(cid:9) 14,000\nGovernmental hospitals are for the most part\nowned by counties, municipalities, or in some States\nhospital districts. Except for State university hospitals,\nState institutions are generally confined to mental,\ntuberculosis or other specialized hospitals. County\nand municipal hospitals include some, mostly in the larger\ncities, that are operated exclusively or primarily for\nindigents who are expected to pay little or nothing for\ntheir care. Most governmental general hospitals, however,\noperate in much the same fashion as private nonprofit\ninstitutions, described below. These 'governmental\ninstitutions serve as general community hospitals,\naccept paying patients, and grant staff privileges to\nlocal physicians who bill their patients as private\npractitioners. These hospitals differ little from\nprivate nonprofit hospitals except in the manner of\nselection of the governing boards, and sometimes in having\n*/ E.G., pediatric hospitals and maternity hospitals.\nFigures do not include psychiatric hospitals. See,\nHospitals, Journal of the American Hospital Association\n2, \n(Aug. 1, 1961, part  ,;.page 428) .\n**/ By the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospitals.\n\nM\n- 38 -\na call upon tax funds t6 meet deficits.\nThe nonprofit community hospital was originally,\nand still is in the older parts of the country, the back-\nbone of our general hospital system. The older hospitals\nwere organized, frequently under religious auspices,\nprimarily as institutions for care of the sick poor. With\nthe tremendous growth of curative medicine in the last\nforty years and its increasing concentration in the\nhospital, these older institutions, and their modern cou_.,ter-\nparts both public and nonprofit, have become centers for\nthe care of the entire population, and thus centers for\nthe practice of medicine in its treatment of the seriously\nill. Not only does the hospital provide the attending\nphysician with expert nursing care of his patient, but it\nsupplies also a wide range of ancillary services and\nfacilities. Operating and delivery rooms and at least\nminimal laboratory and X-ray services are found in all\ncommunity general hospitals; the larger and better hospitals\nplace a great and ever-growing complex of professional,\nsubprofessional and technical services at the disposal of\nthe clinician. Typically the hospital employs or con-\ntracts with medical specialists to head pathology,\nradiology, and sometimes other departments; but typically\nthe care of the individual patient is the responsibility\nof a private practitioner who enjoys staff privileges but\nhas no financial relationship with the hospital.\nStaff privileges, classified and sometimes\ngraduated in accordance with the qualifications of the\nindividual physician, are granted by the governing board\non recommendation of the medical staff or a staff com-\nmittee. Membership on a hospital staff has become\nessential to the practice of many branches of medicine,\n\nr\n39 -\nand the interchange it provides is also an important\nelement in the continuing professional education of the\npractitioner. The organized medical staff of a hospital,\nand its committees that review the work of individual\npractitioners, constitute for most physicians the single\nexception to the individualistic pattern of practice which\nhas been traditional in the medical profession.\nThe larger hospitals, both governmental and non-\nprofit, perform substantial educational functions, most\nnotably in graduate medical education and in the training\nof professional nurses, These teaching hospitals are\ngenerally regarded as providing, by and large, the highest\nquality of care. A hospital internship has become an\nalmost universal prerequisite to medical practice, and a\nresidency is essential to qualification as a specialist.\nEighty-five per cent of the registered nurses of the\ncountry are produced by hospital schools of nursing. Some\nhospitals also train practical nurses, laboratory techni-\ncians, and a number of other paramedical groups. Although\nstudent services are availed of by the hospitals in vary-\ning degree, these educational activities incur substantial\nnet deficits which are generally recouped by charging\npaying patients somewhat more than the immediate cost of\nservices to them.\nNonprofit hospitals are controlled by governing\nboards which usually either are self-perpetuating or are\nselected by religious bodies with which hospitals are\naffiliated. The hospitals and their property are widely\nexempted from taxation. For purposes of the Federal\nincome tax, including deductibility of gifts to them, they\nare classified as charitable institutions. States and\nlocalities almost universally exempt these hospitals from\n of Statewide plans was an important\nt\nState. This requiremen\ninnovation, bringing a measure of order into what had\nr, 7(cid:9) +1-(cid:9) ..,.. - -- -\n\n- 41 -\nequaled in volume the construction aided by the program).\nAlthough State construction programs were re-\nquired to establish priorities in accordance with Federal\nAtandards based primarily on the relative shortage of\nfacilities, in some other respects the States were left\na free hand in selecting the projects to be aided.\nSpecifically, as between a public and a nonprofit project\nin a given community, or as between competing nonprofit\nprojects, the State was made the arbiter; in those States\nthat provided racially separate facilities, the option to\napprove \"separate but equal\" hospitals for Federal aid was\nleft to the State.\nTo summarize:\n1. Community hospitals have become essential,\nboth to provide hospital service to the people of the com-\nmunity and to enable its physicians to practice good\nmedicine.\n2. The functions of such hospitals can be, and\nare, performed equally well by governmental and by private\nnonprofit institutions. Not only do the two kinds of insti-\ntutions perform the same community functions, but they do so\nin the same way and with the same relationships to their\npatients and to the practicing profession. They enjoy\nthe \nsubstantially  same freedom from taxation, and often\nthe same or similar support from public funds. Such\ndifferences as there may be in the make-up of the govern-\ning boards or in the financial structure are usually all\nbut invisible to patients or to physicians.\n3. The Hill-Burton Act recognizes the inter-\nchangeability of public and nonprofit community hospitals\nand aids the two on the same terms, leaving the choice\nin each individual case to the community and the State.\n\n- 42 -\nThe State plan must be addressed to the provision of\nadequate facilities for all of the people of the State,\nbiat effectuation of the plan may be through any combina-\ntion of public and nonprofit institutions. Each institu-\ntion must be open to all people of the community unless\nthe State elects to approve \"separate but equal\" facilities\nfor separate groups.\n\n^,.(cid:9) .- r(cid:9) j1 [ r^\t - ..^i:\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA\nGREENSBORO DIVISION\nG.

Ch. 6 A.,\nsubch, IV. This act established a program of federal grants\nto the states for the construction of public and other non-\n2/\nprofit hospitals.\nThe grants are made available upon approval by\nthe Surgeon General of plans submitted by the states. The\nkey provision -- the one here in question -- provides that\nthe Surgeon General shall by general regulation prescribe:\n(f)(cid:9) That the State plan shall provide\nfor adequate hospital facilities for the\npeople residing in a State, without dis-\ncrimination on account of race, creed, or\ncolor, and shall provide for adequate\nhospital facilities for persons unable to\npay therefor. Such regulation may require\nthat before approval of any application\nfor a hospital or addition to a hospital is\nrecommended by a State agency, assurance\nshall be received by the State from the\napplicant that (1) such hospital or ad-\ndition to a hospital will be made available\nto all persons residing in the territorial\narea of the applicant, without discrimination\n2/(cid:9) The program was originally limited to a period of five\nyears. As amended by the Act of August 14, 1958, 72 Stat.\n616, 42 U.S.C. 291 (d), the program has been extended to\nJune 30, 1964 and annual appropriations of $150 million\nhave been authorized, The statute also has been amended in\nother respects, the major changes being in 1954 when special\ngrant categories were added for diagnostic and treatment\ncenters, chronic disease hospitals, rehabilitation facili-\nties and nursing homes (section 641, et seq.; 42 U.S.0\n291, et seq.).\n\n-4-\non account of race, creed, or color, but an\nexception shall be made in cases where separate\nhospital facilities are provided for separate\npopulation groups, if the plan makes equit-\nable provision on the basis of need for\nfacilities and services of like quality for\neach such group; and (2) there will be made\navailable in each such hospital or addition\nto a hospital a reasonable volume of hospital\nservices to persons unable to pay therefor,\nbut an exception shall be made if such a\nrequirement is not feasible from a financial\nstandpoint.\nPursuant to the provision, the Surgeon General adopted\nthe following pertinent regulations (42 C.F.R. § 53.111,\n53.112):\n§53.111 General. The State plan shall\nprovide for adequate hospital, diagnostic\nor treatment center, rehabilitation facility,\nand nursing home service for the people re-\nsiding in a State without discrimination on\naccount of race, creed, or color, and shall\nprovide for adequate facilities of these\ntypes for persons unable to pay therefor.\n§53„112 Nondiscrimination. Before a\nconstruction application is recommended by\na State agency for approval, the State agency\nshall obtain assurance from the applicant\nthat the facilities to be built with aid\nunder the Act will be made available without\ndiscrimination on account of race, creed, or\ncolor, to all persons residing in the area to\nbe served by that facility. However, in any\narea where separate hospital, diagnostic or\ntreatment center, rehabilitation or nursing\nhome facilities, are provided for separate\npopulation groups, the State agency may waive\nthe requirement of assurance from the con-\nstruction applicant if (a) it finds that the\nplan otherwise makes equitable provision on\nthe basis of need for facilities and services\nof like quality for each such population group\nin the area, and (b) such finding is sub-\nsequently approved by the Surgeon General,.\nFacilities provided under the Federal Act will\nbe considered as making equitable provision\nfor separate population groups when the\nfacilities to be built for the group less\nwell provided for heretofore are equal to\nthe proportion of such group in the total\npopulation of the area, except that the\nState plan shall not program facilities for\na separate population group for construction\nbeyond the level of adequacy for such group.\nA State, to participate in the program, is re-\nquired to submit for approval by the Surgeon General a state\nplan setting forth a \"hospital construction program\" which,\n4\n\n-5-\namong other things, \"meets the requirements as to lack\nof discrimination on account of race, creed,or color,\nrequired by the regulations prescribed under section\n291e(f). . . .\" (42 U.S.C. 291f(a)(4). The state may\nmeet this non-discrimination requirement \"in any area\nwhere separate hospital, dia-i!ostic or treatment center,\nrehabilitation or nursing home facilities, are provided\nfor separate population groups . • . if . . . the plan\notherwise makes equitable provision on the basis of need\nfor facilities and services of like quality for each such\npopulation group in the area, and. • . such finding is\nsubsequently approved by the Surgeon General.\" (Regulation\n52.112, 42 C, F. R., 53.112). !there a separate-but-equal\nplan is in operation, the individual applicant for aid need\nnot give any assurance that it will not discriminate and,\nin fact, expressly indicates on its application form that\n\"certain persons in this area will be denied admission to\nthe proposed facilities as patients because of race, creed,\n3/\nor color.\" (cid:9) The arrangement to extend aid is formally cone:\ncluded by a memorandum of agreement signed by representatives\nof the applicant, the state agency and the Surgeon General.\n3/(cid:9) There are, however, a multitude of requirements\nthat an applicant must meet to be approved by the state\nagency. For example, in approving any application the\nstate agency is required by regulation (42 C.F.R. 53.127(d))\nto certify that the application contains reasonable\nassurances as to title, payment of prevailing rates of\nwages, and financial support for the construction and\noperation of the project; that the plans and specifications\nfor construction of the project are in accord with the minimum\nconstruction standards in the Federal regulations; that the\napplication is in conformity with the State plan; that the\napplication contains an assurance that the applicant will\nconform to the requirements of sections 53.111. 53.112, and\n53.113 of the Regulations regarding the provision of facilities\nfor persons unable to pay therefore; that the application\ncontains an assurance that the applicant will conform to state\nstandards for operation and maintenance and to all appli-\ncable state laws and state and local regulations; that the\napplication is entitled to priority over other projects\nwithin the state; and that the state agency has approved the\napplication.\n\n-6-\nB.(cid:9) The Allegations of the Pleadings\nThe allegations of the complaint and of the\npleading in intervention may be summarized as follows:\nIn September 1946, the State of North Carolina,\nacting through the North Carolina i;edical Care Commission,\nfiled with the Public Health Service an application, pur-\nsuant to the Act, for federal funds to conduct a survey,\nof existing hospital and related facilities in North\nCarolina. The application was approved and, following an\nallotment of funds to the State, the North Carolina Medical\nCare Commission filed a state plan with the Public Health\nService. This plan was approved by the Surgeon 'General on\nJuly 8, 1947, and, with periodic revisions, has remained in\neffect to the time of the filing of the pleading in inter-\nvention.\nThe State plan provides for the division of\nGuilford County, North Carolina into two Hospital service\nareas, the Greensboro Hospital Service area and the High\nPoint Hospital service area. Greensboro is one of several\nhospital service areas where, pursuant to the State plan as\napproved by the Surgeon General, separate hospital facili-\nties are provided for separate population groups.\nPlaintiffs are Negro citizens of the United States\nand the State of North Carolina residing in the City of\nGreensboro. Certain of the plaintiffs are qualified medical\ndoctors and certain others are qualified dentists, all practic-\nini in Greensboro. This group of plaintiffs seeks admission\nto the staff facilities of Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital\nand Uesley Long Community Hospital.\nPlaintiffs A. J. Taylor and Donald R, Lyons are\nin need of medical treatment and desire to enter either the\n\n7\nWesley Lon- Community Hospital or the Moses H. Cone\nMemorial Hospital where complete medical equipment and\nthe best facilities for treatment in the Greensboro area\nare available. Plaintiffs also desire treatment from\ntheir personal physicians. Plaintiffs, however, cannot\nbe admitted to the Long Hospital since it follows a\npolicy, practice, custom and usage of refusing to admit\nNegroes to the use of its facilities. Plaintiffs cannot\nenter the Cone Hospital on the same basis as whites nor\ncan they enter the Cone Hospital and be treated by their\npersonal physicians because the Cone Hospital will not\nadmit Negro doctors or dentists to staff facilities.\nDefendants, Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, Inc.,\nand ?lesley Lon-- Community Hospital Inc., are North Carolina\ncorporations that have established and now maintain in\nGreensboro, North Carolina, the Noses H. Cone Memorial\nHospital and the Tiesley Long Community Hospital, respectively,\nwhich are tax exempt and state licensed. Defendant Harold\nBettis is the Director of the Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital\nInc. and defendant A. 0. Smith is the AdministratLr of the\nWesley Long Community Hospital.\nThe complaint and the pleading in intervention\nmake these allegations with respect to the functioning and\noperation of defendant hospitals:\n1.(cid:9) Of the fifteen members of the Board of\nTrustees of Cone Hospital, six are appointed by agents or\n4/\nsubdivisions of the State of North Carolina.\n4/(cid:9) Three members are appointed by the Governor of North\nCarolina; one member is named by the Board of Commissioners\nof the City of Greensboro; one member is named by the Board\nof Guilford County; one member is named by the Board of\nCommissioners of Watauga County.\n\n- 8 -\n2. One member of the Board of Trustees of Cone\nHospital is appointed by the Guilford County Medical Society -\n- a component of the Medical Society of North Carolina. The\nlatter body appoints the Board of Medical Examiners of North\nCarolina and elects four members of the State Board of Health.\n3. Cone Hospital conducts training and is regu-\nlarly used as a place of training for student nurses from\nthe Jomen's College of the University of North Carolina\nand the Agricultural and Training Colle.:e of North Carolina,\nboth of which are tax supported, public institutions.\n4. The Cone and Long Hospitals have received\nthe following amounts of federal funds under the Hill-\nBurton Act:\nCone Hospital:\n(a) $462,000.00 for new construction the estimated\ntotal cost of which is $5,277,023.00;\n(b) $697,950.00 for an addition and remodeling of\nthe General Hospital, the estimated total cost of which\nwas $1,850,000.00;\n(c) $110,000.00 for the construction of a diag-\nnostic and treatment center the estimated total cost of\n5/\nwhich was $240,000.00\n57(cid:9) The funds described in paragraph (a) above were requested\nin project application NC-86, dated June 17, 1950 and the funds\ndescribed in paragraphs (b) and (c) above were requested in\nproject applications NC-330, dated October 28, 1959. These\napplications were approved by the North Carolina Medical Care\nCommission and submitted to the Surgeon General who approved\nthe projects on July 11, 1950 and Paarch 17, 1960, respectively.\n\n-9-\nL on g Hospital:\n(a) $1,617,150.00 for new hospital construction\nthe total estimated cost of which is $3,240,722.00;\n(b) 166,000,00 for an adjunct service facility ad-\ndition the total cost of which is $120,000.00;\n(c) $265,650.00 for a nursing home addition,\n6/\nthe estimated total cost of which is $492,636.00.\nThese funds have been allocated to defendant Cone and\nLong Hospitals by the North Carolina Medical Care\nCommission, an agency of the State of North Carolina\ncharged with the sole responsibility for administering\nthe program of federal grants in aid of hospital con-\nstruction in the State of North Carolina, including\nallocation of the federal funds received to the\n7/\nvarious state hospitals.\n5. In Cone Hospital projects NC-86 and NC-330\nas originally submitted to the Surgeon General by the\nCommission and as approved by him, the Commission stated\nthat the applicant had given adequate assurances that the\nhospital facilities would be operated without discrimina-\ntion because of race, creed,or color. On April 15, 1960,\nWilliam F. Henderson, Executive Secretary of the Commission,\nwrote to the Public Health Service stating that project\napplication NC-330 had incorrectly stated the intention\n6/(cid:9) The funds described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c)\nabove were requested in project applications NC-311, dated\nNbvember.18, 1958, NC-353, dated sometime prior to January\n12, 1961, NC-358, dated February 1, 1961. These applications\nwere approved by the North Carlina Medical Care Commission\nand submitted to the Surgeon General who approved the projects\non June 30, 1959, May 15, 1961 and December 15, 1961,\nrespectively.\n7/(cid:9) As of the date of the filing of the pleading in\nintervention, the United States has paid to the Treasurer\nof the State of North Carolina the sum of $1,229,552.50\non projects NC-86 and NC-330 for the Cone Hospital and\n$1,596,301.60 on projects UC-311 and NC-353 for the Long\nHospital.\n\n- 10 -\nof the Cone Hospital with respect to the assurances that\nthe hospital facilities would be operated without dis-\ncrimination because of race, creed, or color. By amend-\nment submitted to the Surgeon General and approved by him\non April 19, 1960, the_ Commission and Cone Hospital with-\ndrew the non-discrimination assurance previously 1-iven.\n6. The Long Hospital has not given assurances\nthat it will operate its facilities without discrimination\nbecause of race, creed, or color.\n7. Defendant Cone and Long Hospitals are\npursuing a policy, grounded on race, of barring physicians\n8/\nand dentists -- such as plaintiffs -- from staff privileges.\nIn addition, defendant Cone Hospital refuses to admit Negro\n9/\npatients on the same terms and conditions as white persons,\nand defendant Long Hospital refuses entirely to admit Negro\npatients to the use of its facilities. Plaintiffs allege\nthat this policy, practice, custom and usage violates their\nrights to the equal protection of the laws and due process\nof law as guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments\nto the Constitution of the United States.\nThe plaintiff physicians and dentists allege\nthat they are now suffering and will continue to suffer\nirreparable injury by the maintenance of defendants'\npolicy, practice, custom and usage as described in the\n8/(cid:9) All physsicians and dentist plaintiffs have applied for\nadmission to the staff of defendant Cone Hospital and have\nbeen rejected. All physician and dentist plaintiffs have\nrequested staff application forms from defendant Long\nHospital but these requests have not yet been honored.\n9/(cid:9) The complaint also alleges that when Negro patients\nare admitted, they are not permitted to be treated by\ntheir own physicians or dentists.\n\nLL\ncomplaint, including loss of earnings and deprivation\nof the opportunity to further develop the skills neces-\nsary for continued proficiency of their chosen profession.\nThe plaintiff patients allee that they are\nnow suffering and will continue to suffer irreparable\ninjury by the maintenance of defendants' policy, practice,\nand usage, as described in the complaint, including\ndeprivation of the opportunity of receiving medical care\nin the most complete medical facilities available in\ntheir locality and the use of said facilities with the\ntreatment of their own pyysicians and dentists.\nPlaintiffs pray for declaratory and injunctive\nrelief which would:\n1. Declare 42 U.S.C. 291e(f) and Regulation\n58.112 unconstitutional.\n2. Enjoin defendants from continuin g to\nenforce their policy of denying admission to their\nmedical staffs on the grounds of race.\n3. Enjoin defendants from continuing to enforce\ntheir policy of denying admission to patients on the basis\nof race and in any way conditioning or abridging the\nadmission to, and use of, the facilities of Cone and\nLong Hospitals on the basis of race.\nThe United States joins with the plaintiffs in\nrequesting this Court to declare unconstitutional so much\nof section 291e(f) of Title 42 U.S.C. as authorizes the\nSurgeon General to prescribe regulations concerning\nseparate hospital facilities for separate population\ngroups. In addition, the United States asserts that the\nconduct of defendant hospitals attacked in this proceeding\nviolates the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution,\n\n- 12 -\nIi\nA RGUHBNT\nA.(cid:9) Introduction\nSince this case draws in question the con-\nstitutionality of an Act of Congress, the United States\nbelieves it is required, under 28 U.S.C. 2403, to state\nits position as to the constitutionality of the statute\nunder attach. Lie- recognize, of course, the self-imposed\njudicial inhibition against passing on the validity of\nan Act of Congress \"unless absolutely necessary to a\ndecision of the case.\" Burton v. United States, 196 U.S\n10/\n283, 295 (1905).(cid:9) However, we believe that if the Court\nconcludes that the conduct of the defendants is subject\nto constitutional limitations, it will, of necessity, be\nrequired to pass on the constitutionality of the separate-\nbut-equal provisions of the Hill-Burton Act. It is that\nAct which expressly sanctions the defendants' conduct, and\nit is that Act which expressly authorized the State of North\nCarolina to devise a hospital construction plan that dis-\ncriminates on the basis of race, in violation of the Four-\nteenth Amendment, jhere unlawful conduct appears to be ex-\npressly authorized by a statutory provision, we do not\nbelieve that, when the conduct is attacked, the Court can\navoid adjudicating the constitutionality of the provision\ninvolved.\n10/(cid:9) Cases are collected in the opinion of I,Ir. Justice\nBrandeis in Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority,\n297 U.S. 288, 345 et seq. (1936). See also United States\nv. Auto T!orkers, 352 U.S. 567, 589-593 (1957).\n\n- 13 -\nB.(cid:9) The Provision of the Hill-Burton Act\nSanctioninc; the Construction of\nSeparate-But-Equal Hospital\nFacilities is Unconstitutional\nThis case raises the question of whether the\nConstitution permits Congress to authorize expressly the\n\"separate-but-equal\" treatment of different racial groups\nin federal-state programs. The United States takes the\nposition that the Constitution does not condone such\ntreatment and that the \"separate-but-equal\" provisions of\nthe Hill-Burton Act are violative of the Fifth Amendment,\nand the action of a state in administering a \"separate-\nbut-equal\" hospital construction program is impermissible\nunder the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nIn the Hill-Burton Act, Congress has authorized\nfederal-state cooperation in a federally financed, state\nadministered program of hospital construction for the\nbenefit of all the people (42 U.S.C. 291(a)). Although\nthe Act specifically provides that state hospital construction\nprograms shall not discriminate \"on account of race, creed\nor color\", Congress has further prescribed that this non-\n-iscrimination standard may be met if the state program\nprovides for the construction of \"separate-but-equal\"\nfacilities. Thus, the Hill-Burton Act is not merely\nneutral or silent on the question of racia?. discrimination.\nRather, Congress incorporated into the statute a standard\nbased on race and has authorized and sanctioned racial\ndiscrimination by state-connected institutions -- racial\ndiscrimination that clearly violates the Fourteenth Amendment.\nCongress has no power, under the Fifth Amendment, to do this.\nFirst, section 29le(f) of Title 42 is, on its\nface, violative of the Constitution. That our Constitution\nprohibits the utilization of race as a yardstick in any\n\n- 14 -\ntype of governmental activity is now too well established\nto be questioned. Racial classifications are \"obviously\n11\nirrelevant and invidious.\" This principle was succinctly\nstated by Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting in Plessy v.\nFerguson, 163 U.S. 537, 559 (1896):\nOur Constitution is color-blind, and neither\nknows nor tolerates classes among citizens.\n* * * The law regards man as man, and takes\nno account of his surroundings or of his color\nwhen his civil rights as guaranteed by the\nsupreme law of the sand are involved. * * *\nSecond, the Hill-Burton Act expressly sanctions\nracial discrimination by state-connected institutions.\nIt is now beyond question that racial discrimination by\na state runs afoul of the Constitution since, \"for a\nstate to place its authority behind discriminatory treatment\nbased solely on color is indubitably a denial by a State\nof the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the\n12/\nFourteenth Amendment.\"(cid:9) Nevertheless, despite this clear\nprinciple, under the Act, the states are expressly authorized\nto devise hospital construction programs that provide separate\nfacilities for the races. The state program must be approved\nby the Surgeon General and he must determine whether the\nstate properly has applied the separate-but-equal formula.\nIn effect, therefore, the federal government takes a very\ndirect part in cooperating with the states in the effectuation\nof a separate-but-equal hospital pro-ram. This is state\nsponsored racial discrimination,w:ith a federal imprimatur.\n11/ Steele v. Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co.,\n323 U.S. 192, 203 (1944).\n12/ Mr. Justice Frankfurter, dissenting on other grounds\nin Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715,\n727 (1961).\n\n- 15 -\nFor Congress expressly to authorize such a scheme necessarily\n13/\nviolates the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\nCertainly, Congress has power to promote hospital construction,\nbut it cannot use that power \"to attain an unconstitutional\nresult.\" Uester.n Union Telegraph Co, v. Foster,(cid:9) 2447 U.S.\n105, 114 (1918). Cf, Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339\n(1960). With respect to a related field of federal activity,\nthe Supreme Court has said (United States v. Butler, 297 U.S.\n1, 74 (1936)):\nit is said that no one has doubted the\npower of Congress to stipulate the sort of\neducation for which money shall be expended.\n13/ In Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S, 497 (1954) the Court\nindicated that, with respect to racial discrimination, the\nreach of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment was\ncoextensive with that of the equal protection clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. The Court said (347 U.S. at 500):\n\"In view of our decision that the Constitution pro-\nhibits the states from maintaining racially segregated public\nschools, it would be unthinkable that the same Constitution\nwould impose a lesser duty on the Federal Government. We\nhold that racial segregation in the public schools of the\nDistrict of Columbia is a denial of the due process of law\nguaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\"\na \nSee also Steele v. Louisville  Nashville R.R. Co., 323 U.S\n192 (1944) where Justice Murphy, in a concurring opinion,\nstated (323 U.S. at 208):\n\"The Act [the Railway Labor Act] contains no\nlanguage which directs the manner in which the bargaining\nrepresentative shall perform his duties.

It\nis enough that racial discrimination is permitted or\nsanctioned. Thus, the Kansas statute involved in Brown v.\nBoard of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954) permitted, but did\nnot require, cities of more than 15,000 population to main-\ntamn separate school facilities for Negro and white studenls.\n14/ In A4ing v. Horgan, 3 R.R.L. Rep. 693, 699 (Cal, Super. Ct.\n1958) the court held that private persons who accepted federal\nmortgage guarantees were bound by the Fifth Amendment. With\nregard to the absence of an explicit non-discrimination pro-\nvision in the act of Congress in issue, the court said:\nIf it be objected that Congress refused to so\nso ordain, it must be replied that Congress could\nnot ordain otherwise -- the law does not permit\nit to differentiate between races, and whether it\nexpresses that limitation in so many words or\nnot • . . .\n15/ Cf.

While no case has been\nfound which specifically holds that state aided hospitals\n17/\nmay not be operated on a separate but equal basis, (cid:9) it\nis clear that the separate but equal doctrine has been\nthoroughly repudiated and may no longer be applied. That\ndoctrine had its birth prior to the adoption of the\nFourteenth Amendment in the decision of a Massachusetts\nState Court relating to public schools. Robert v. City of\nBoston, 59 Mass. 198 (1849). The doctrine of that case was\nfollowed in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896) where\nthe Supreme Court held as to intrastate commerce that a\nLouisiana statute, requiring railway companies to provide\nequal but separate accommodations for the white and colored\nraces was not in conflict with the provisions of the\nFourteenth Amendment.\nHowever, in Morgan v. Virginia, 328 U.S. 373\n(1946) the Court held that a state statute requiring\nsegregated seats for Negro passengers on interstate buses\nwas an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.\nIn Henderson v.

It is clear, therefore, that Congress may not\nenact a statute authorizing a hospital construction program\nbased on a separate-but-equal formula, and a state may not\nadminister such a program.

Rev. 131, 162, 163 (1950); Flack, Adoption of the\nFourteenth Amendment.\n22/ The interrelationship between governmental and\nprivate activity was aptly described by Chief Justice\nVinson in American Communications Ass'n v, Douds, 339\nU.S. 382, 401 (1950) where he wrote: \". . . when author-\nity derives in part from Government's thumb on the scales,\nthe exercise of that power by private persons becomes\nclosely akin, in some respects, to its exercise by Govern-\nment itself.\"\n\n- 23 -\nHere the racially discriminatory conduct\n23/\noccurred in hospitals heavily supported by public monies.\nThese hospitals are licensed by the State of North Caro-\nlina and receive the substantial benefit of being exempt\nfrom city and county taxes. Both hospitals received\ntheir financial aid pursuant to a hospital construction\nplan prepared by the North Carolina Medical Care Commis-\nsion which specifically authorized the expenditure of\npublic monies on a separate but equal basis, Each hospi-\ntal applied directly to the Medical Care Commission for\nfinancial aid; each hospital had its application reviewed\nand approved by the Commission; each hospital entered into\na memorandum of understanding with the Commission and the\nSurgeon General of the United States. Of the fifteen\nmembers of the Board of Trustees of Cone Hospital, six\nare appointed by agents or subdivisions of the State and\none is appointed by a quasi-governmental body. In addi-\ntion, Cone Hospital cooperates with tax supported public\ncolleges and universities of North Carolina in a nurses\ntraining program.\nThe Fourteenth Amendment's applicability to\nthis case does not depend upon whether each of the varied\naspects of state involvement are alone sufficient to\nsatisfy the \"state action\" requirements of that Amendment.\nRather, state involvement must be viewed as a totality --\nas the sum of various related activities. Here, we believe,\nthe state \"has so far insinuated itself into a position\n23/ Long Hospital has been authorized to receive almost\ntwo million dollars in public monies -- fifty percent of\nits construction requirements.

Indeed, we think it plain that the prohibitions\nof the Fourteenth Amendment have been held binding in\nsituations where state participation might be deemed less\ndirect and substantial than it is here.\nOnly recently, the Supreme Court had before it\nthe problem of determining whether the state had become\nso involved in private conduct as to make the action of\nprivate individuals subject to the Fourteenth Amendment.\nIn holding that a private restaurant operating in a public\nbuilding under a lease from a public authority could not\nengage in racial discrimination, the Court noted (Burton\nv. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715, 722 (1961):\nOnly by sifting facts and weighing\ncircumstances can the nonobvious involve-\nment of the State in private conduct be\nattributed its true significance. 25/\n24/ Burton v, [Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715,\n725 (1962).\n25/ Even before Burton there was a large body of case law\nwhich proscribed discrimination by a lessee of public\nproperty or facilities.

Although these decisions are\nrested on various grounds -- in some, that the lease was\na technique of evading state responsibility; in others,\nthat the property, though privately operated, was being\nused for a public purpose -- they have been uniform in\nreaching the conclusion that the discrimination effectuated\nby the private lessee was constitutionally forbidden.\n\n- 25 -\nIn many other areas the courts have also sifted\nfacts and weighed circumstances so as not to permit con-\nduct to escape the fall-out of the Fourteenth Amendment\nmerely by sheltering under the cloak of \"private action.\"\nThus, in the Girard College Case, Pennsylvania v. Board\nof Directors of City Trusts, 353 U.S. 230 (1957), the\ndiscrimination (in that case, against Negro applicants\nfor admission to Girard College) stemmed from the fact\nthat an individual had placed :Limitations upon the use\nof monies which he had placed in a private trust. A state\nagency was involved in the matter as trustee, i.e., it\nwas engaged in carrying out the trust in accordance with\nits terms. The Supreme Court nevertheless concluded that\nthe action of the trustee was \"discrimination by the State\"\n(353 U.S. at 231). This case thus illustrates the general\nprinciple that what is material and decisive, for pur-\nposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, is that the state\n26/\nhas chosen to place its power behind the discrimination.\nIf a state cannot participate in the administration of\na private trust which draws racial distinctions, as the\nGirard case holds, it follows, we believe, that it cannot\nparticipate in a vast hospital program which involves\ndiscrimination on the basis of race.\nThere are also other instances in which osten-\nsibly private actions have been found to have sufficient\nnexus with governmental action to justify use of the\n26/ \",(cid:9)  ,  Under some circumstances state contact, con-\ntrol and encouragement may be so intimately fused with\nthe activities of a private group or individual in the\nperformance of a public function that it seems fair to\ncall the activity 'state action' . . , ,\" Shanks,\n\"State Action\" and the Girard Estate Case, 105 U, of Pa.\nL.

Here also\nthe discriminatory policy attacked is one expressly sanctioned\nby federal law and abetted by state planning. Certainly,\nthrough the Hill-Burton Act, governmental power and authority\nhas sufficiently insinuated itself into the affairs of the\ndefendant hospitals as to provide a decisive distinction\n34/\nfrom the Eaton case.\n33/ For example, tine defendant hospitals have given assurances\nthat they will accept indigent patients, thus carrying out a\npublic obligation. In Eaton, indigent patients were treated\nmerely on a contract basis.\n34/ Even in Eaton, the district court recognized that every\ncase must be evaluated on its own terms. Thus, the court said\n(164 F. Supp. at 196): \"when considering the ability to con-\ntrol, it must be noted that it is a composite of elements, :nor\nthere are as many elements of 'control as there are qualities.\nand quanties in the controlled subject,. The elements must re\nviewed in their relationship to each other and as part of a\nsum total, and for this reason each case must be viewed on\nits• rlerits.\"\n\nl\n- 31 -\nFinally, while we believe that the involvement\nof governmental power and authority in the defendants'\nactivities is sufficient to require the defendant hos-\npitals to conform to the commands of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, we are also persuaded that where, as here,\nan institution is of a public nature, affecting the\ncommunity at large, such an institution is \"a public\nfacility in which there can be no more discrimination\nbased on race than is constitutionally permissible in\nthe more customary types of public facility.\" (Mr.\nJustice Douglas concurring in Garner v. Louisiana, 368\nU.S. 157, 183 (1961)). Courts have long recognized that\nrestrictions properly could be placed on activities\naffected with a public interest. See Munn v. Illinois,\n94 U.S. 113 (1876); Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502\n(1934); Marsh v. Alabama, supra; Boman v. Birmingham\n35/\nTransit Co., 280 F. 2d 531 (C.A. 5, 1960).(cid:9) In the Garner\ncase, supra, Mr. Justice Douglas, in a concurring opinion,\nconcluded that such restrictions should be extended to\n36/\na retail establishment under permit from a municipality.\n35/ Lord Chief Justice Hale stated in De Portibus Maris,\nI Harg. Law Tracts 78, \". . . if a man set out a street\nin new building on his land, it is now no longer bare\nprivate interest, but is affected with a public interest.\"\n36/ Mr. Justice Douglas relied heavily on the fact that\nthe retail establishments were licensed by the state (as\nare the hospitals in this case). He wrote (Garner v.\nLouisiana, supra at 184-85):\nI do not believe that a State that\nlicenses a business can license it to serve\nonly whites or only blacks or only yellows\nor only browns. Race is an impermissible\nclassification when it comes to parks or\nother municipal facilities by reason of\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment. By the same token, I\ndo not see how a State can constitutionally\nexercise its licensing power over business\neither in terms or in effect to segregate\nthe races in the licensed premises. The\n(continued)\n\nJ\n— 32 —\nIt is particularly appropriate to view a non-\nprofit hospital as an institution affected with a public\ninterest, As the memorandum of the General Counsel of\nthe Department of Health, Education and Welfare (attached\nhereto as an appendix) reveals, non—profit hospitals\nhave a decidedly public character. This memorandum\n36/(cid:9) (continued)\nauthority to license a business for public\nuse is derived from the public. Negroes\nare as much a part of that public as are\nwhites. A municipality granting a license\nto operate a business for the public repre-\nsents Negroes as well as all other races\nwho live there. A license to establish\na restaur:a±' '.s °a licene , to establish a\npublic facility and necessarily imports, in\nlaw, equality of use for all members of the\npublic, I see no way whereby licenses\nissued by a State tot. serve the public can\nbe distinguished from leases of public\nfacilities (Burton v, Wilmington Parking\nAuthority, supra) for that end.\nOne can close the doors of his home to\nanyone he desires. But one who operates\nan enterprise under-.a license from the\ngovernment enjoys a privilege that derives\nfrom the people. Whether retail stores,\nnot licensed by the municipality, stand\non a different footing is not presented\nhere, But the necessity of a license\nshows that the public has rights in respect\nto those premises. The business is not\na matter of mere private concern, Those\nwho license enterprises for public use\nshould not have under our Constitution\nthe power to license it for the use of\nonly one race. For there is the over-\nriding constitutional requirement that\nall state power be exercised so as not\nto deny equal protection to any group.\nAs the first Mr. Justice Harlan stated\nin dissent in P lessy v. Ferguson, supra,\nat 559, \". • • in view of the Constitution,\nin the eye of the law, there is in this\ncountry no superior, dominant, ruling\nclass of citizens. There is no caste\nhere. Our constitution is color blind\ntt\n\n- 33 -\nindicates that while there are 2,276 accredited private\nnon-profit hospitals in the United States, there are\nonly 524 governmental and 154 proprietary (profit-\nmaking) accredited hospitals. The governmental hospitals\n\"differ little from private non-profit hospitals except\nin the manner of selection of the governing boards,\nand sometimes in having a call upon tax funds to meet\ndeficits.\" Both governmental and non-profit hospitals\nserve as general community hospitals. Such \"community\nhospitals have become essential, both to provide hospi-\ntal service to the people of the community and to enable\nits physicians to practice good medicine.\" Hence non-\nprofit hospitals perform a vital function which would\notherwise have to be performed by the state. It is not,\ntherefore, inappropriate to include such hospitals\n371\nwithin the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment. Only\nrecently a court suggested that schools and colleges,\n\"no matter how 'private' they may claim to be,\" are\nso affected with the public interest as to be bound by\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, in Guillory v. Adminis-\ntrators of Tulane University, 30 L.W. 2469 (E.D. La.,\n1962), the court said:\n37/ Here the State of North Carolina has chosen to make\nadequate hospital service available to all of its people\nby designating, throughout the State, public and private\nnon-profit hospitals as recipients of federal aid. The\ndefendant hospitals are among those designated, and are\nthus among the instrumentalities selected by the State\nfor the effectuation of its purpose -- a purpose that\nincludes, \nand must include, Negroes on the same terms\nas whites. Before the Brown decision, North Carolina\nwas free to achieve its purpose through separate insti-\ntutions for the two races; today, plainly it is not.\nUnder no circumstances, however, do we believe that the\nFourteenth Amendment permits a state, through the device\nof using private institutions to discharge a public func-\ntion, to relieve itself or the institutions of such re-\nsponsibility as is cast upon a state by the Equal Protection\nClause. Today, that responsibility is incompatible with\nracial segregation.\n\n– 34\nAt the outset, one may question whether\nany school or college can ever be so 'private'\nas to escape the reach of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. In a country dedicated to the\ncreed that education is the only 'Sutd\nfoundation * * *of freedom,' 'withotit\nwhich no republic can maintain itself in\nstrength,' institutions of learning\nare not things of purely private concern.\nNo one any longer doubts that education is\na matter affected with the public interest.\nAnd this is true whether it is offered by a\npublic or private institution. . . . Clearly,\nthe administrators of a private college are\nperforming a public function. They do the\nwort, of the state, often in the place of the\nstate. Does it not follow that they stand\nin the state's shoes? And, if so, are they\nnot then agents of the state, subject to the\nconstitutional restraints on governmental\naction, to the same extent as private persons\nwho zovern a company town, Marsh v. Alabama,\n326 U.S. 501, or control a political party,\nTei;-y v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461, or run a city street\ncar and bus service, Public Utilities Comm'n.\nv. Pollak, 343 U.S. 451; Doman v.

Morgan, 5 Cir., 287 F. 2d 750,\n29 L.JC.(cid:9) 2389?\nReason and authority strongly suggest that\nthe Constitution never sanctions racial dis-\ncrimination in our schools and colleges, no\nmatter how 'private' they may claim to be.\nSinilarly ; we believe that the Constitution forbids\nnon—profit hospitals, serving such essential and far reaching\ncommunity needs, to be infected with the virus of racial\ndiscrimination.\nRespectfully submitted,\nBURglE MARSHALL,\nAssistant Attorney General.\n_Tilliam H.

The American Hospital\nAssociation listing for 1960 shows nonfederal short-term\ngeneral (and \"other special\"*) hospitals divided as follows:\nInstitutions Beds\nGovernmental(cid:9) (Listed 1,260(cid:9) 156,000\n(Accredited** 524(cid:9) 121,000\nPrivate nonprofit\n(Listed 3,291(cid:9) 446,000\n(Accredited 2,276(cid:9) 403,000\nProprietary(cid:9) (Listed(cid:9) 856(cid:9) 37,000\n(Accredited(cid:9) 154(cid:9) 14,000\nGovernmental hospitals are for the most part\nowned by counties, municipalities, or in some States\nhospital districts. Except for State university hospitals,\nState institutions are generally confined to mental,\ntuberculosis or other specialized hospitals. County\nand municipal hospitals include some, mostly in the larger\ncities, that are operated exclusively or primarily for\nindigents who are expected to pay little or nothing for\ntheir care. Most governmental general hospitals, however,\noperate in much the same fashion as private nonprofit\ninstitutions, described below. These 'governmental\ninstitutions serve as general community hospitals,\naccept paying patients, and grant staff privileges to\nlocal physicians who bill their patients as private\npractitioners. These hospitals differ little from\nprivate nonprofit hospitals except in the manner of\nselection of the governing boards, and sometimes in having\n*/ E.G., pediatric hospitals and maternity hospitals.\nFigures do not include psychiatric hospitals.

The older hospitals\nwere organized, frequently under religious auspices,\nprimarily as institutions for care of the sick poor. With\nthe tremendous growth of curative medicine in the last\nforty years and its increasing concentration in the\nhospital, these older institutions, and their modern cou_.,ter-\nparts both public and nonprofit, have become centers for\nthe care of the entire population, and thus centers for\nthe practice of medicine in its treatment of the seriously\nill. Not only does the hospital provide the attending\nphysician with expert nursing care of his patient, but it\nsupplies also a wide range of ancillary services and\nfacilities. Operating and delivery rooms and at least\nminimal laboratory and X-ray services are found in all\ncommunity general hospitals; the larger and better hospitals\nplace a great and ever-growing complex of professional,\nsubprofessional and technical services at the disposal of\nthe clinician. Typically the hospital employs or con-\ntracts with medical specialists to head pathology,\nradiology, and sometimes other departments; but typically\nthe care of the individual patient is the responsibility\nof a private practitioner who enjoys staff privileges but\nhas no financial relationship with the hospital.\nStaff privileges, classified and sometimes\ngraduated in accordance with the qualifications of the\nindividual physician, are granted by the governing board\non recommendation of the medical staff or a staff com-\nmittee. Membership on a hospital staff has become\nessential to the practice of many branches of medicine,\n\nr\n39 -\nand the interchange it provides is also an important\nelement in the continuing professional education of the\npractitioner. The organized medical staff of a hospital,\nand its committees that review the work of individual\npractitioners, constitute for most physicians the single\nexception to the individualistic pattern of practice which\nhas been traditional in the medical profession.\nThe larger hospitals, both governmental and non-\nprofit, perform substantial educational functions, most\nnotably in graduate medical education and in the training\nof professional nurses, These teaching hospitals are\ngenerally regarded as providing, by and large, the highest\nquality of care. A hospital internship has become an\nalmost universal prerequisite to medical practice, and a\nresidency is essential to qualification as a specialist.\nEighty-five per cent of the registered nurses of the\ncountry are produced by hospital schools of nursing. Some\nhospitals also train practical nurses, laboratory techni-\ncians, and a number of other paramedical groups. Although\nstudent services are availed of by the hospitals in vary-\ning degree, these educational activities incur substantial\nnet deficits which are generally recouped by charging\npaying patients somewhat more than the immediate cost of\nservices to them.\nNonprofit hospitals are controlled by governing\nboards which usually either are self-perpetuating or are\nselected by religious bodies with which hospitals are\naffiliated. The hospitals and their property are widely\nexempted from taxation. For purposes of the Federal\nincome tax, including deductibility of gifts to them, they\nare classified as charitable institutions. States and\nlocalities almost universally exempt these hospitals from\n of Statewide plans was an important\nt\nState. This requiremen\ninnovation, bringing a measure of order into what had\nr, 7(cid:9) +1-(cid:9) ..,.. - -- -\n\n- 41 -\nequaled in volume the construction aided by the program).\nAlthough State construction programs were re-\nquired to establish priorities in accordance with Federal\nAtandards based primarily on the relative shortage of\nfacilities, in some other respects the States were left\na free hand in selecting the projects to be aided.\nSpecifically, as between a public and a nonprofit project\nin a given community, or as between competing nonprofit\nprojects, the State was made the arbiter; in those States\nthat provided racially separate facilities, the option to\napprove \"separate but equal\" hospitals for Federal aid was\nleft to the State.\nTo summarize:\n1. Community hospitals have become essential,\nboth to provide hospital service to the people of the com-\nmunity and to enable its physicians to practice good\nmedicine.\n2. The functions of such hospitals can be, and\nare, performed equally well by governmental and by private\nnonprofit institutions. Not only do the two kinds of insti-\ntutions perform the same community functions, but they do so\nin the same way and with the same relationships to their\npatients and to the practicing profession. They enjoy\nthe \nsubstantially  same freedom from taxation, and often\nthe same or similar support from public funds. Such\ndifferences as there may be in the make-up of the govern-\ning boards or in the financial structure are usually all\nbut invisible to patients or to physicians.\n3. The Hill-Burton Act recognizes the inter-\nchangeability of public and nonprofit community hospitals\nand aids the two on the same terms, leaving the choice\nin each individual case to the community and the State.\n\n- 42 -\nThe State plan must be addressed to the provision of\nadequate facilities for all of the people of the State,\nbiat effectuation of the plan may be through any combina-\ntion of public and nonprofit institutions. Each institu-\ntion must be open to all people of the community unless\nthe State elects to approve \"separate but equal\" facilities\nfor separate groups.\n\n^,.(cid:9) .- r(cid:9) j1 [ r^\t - ..^i:\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA\nGREENSBORO DIVISION\nG.

Ch. 6 A.,\nsubch, IV. This act established a program of federal grants\nto the states for the construction of public and other non-\n2/\nprofit hospitals.\nThe grants are made available upon approval by\nthe Surgeon General of plans submitted by the states. The\nkey provision -- the one here in question -- provides that\nthe Surgeon General shall by general regulation prescribe:\n(f)(cid:9) That the State plan shall provide\nfor adequate hospital facilities for the\npeople residing in a State, without dis-\ncrimination on account of race, creed, or\ncolor, and shall provide for adequate\nhospital facilities for persons unable to\npay therefor. Such regulation may require\nthat before approval of any application\nfor a hospital or addition to a hospital is\nrecommended by a State agency, assurance\nshall be received by the State from the\napplicant that (1) such hospital or ad-\ndition to a hospital will be made available\nto all persons residing in the territorial\narea of the applicant, without discrimination\n2/(cid:9) The program was originally limited to a period of five\nyears. As amended by the Act of August 14, 1958, 72 Stat.\n616, 42 U.S.C. 291 (d), the program has been extended to\nJune 30, 1964 and annual appropriations of $150 million\nhave been authorized, The statute also has been amended in\nother respects, the major changes being in 1954 when special\ngrant categories were added for diagnostic and treatment\ncenters, chronic disease hospitals, rehabilitation facili-\nties and nursing homes (section 641, et seq.; 42 U.S.0\n291, et seq.).\n\n-4-\non account of race, creed, or color, but an\nexception shall be made in cases where separate\nhospital facilities are provided for separate\npopulation groups, if the plan makes equit-\nable provision on the basis of need for\nfacilities and services of like quality for\neach such group; and (2) there will be made\navailable in each such hospital or addition\nto a hospital a reasonable volume of hospital\nservices to persons unable to pay therefor,\nbut an exception shall be made if such a\nrequirement is not feasible from a financial\nstandpoint.\nPursuant to the provision, the Surgeon General adopted\nthe following pertinent regulations (42 C.F.R. § 53.111,\n53.112):\n§53.111 General. The State plan shall\nprovide for adequate hospital, diagnostic\nor treatment center, rehabilitation facility,\nand nursing home service for the people re-\nsiding in a State without discrimination on\naccount of race, creed, or color, and shall\nprovide for adequate facilities of these\ntypes for persons unable to pay therefor.\n§53„112 Nondiscrimination. Before a\nconstruction application is recommended by\na State agency for approval, the State agency\nshall obtain assurance from the applicant\nthat the facilities to be built with aid\nunder the Act will be made available without\ndiscrimination on account of race, creed, or\ncolor, to all persons residing in the area to\nbe served by that facility. However, in any\narea where separate hospital, diagnostic or\ntreatment center, rehabilitation or nursing\nhome facilities, are provided for separate\npopulation groups, the State agency may waive\nthe requirement of assurance from the con-\nstruction applicant if (a) it finds that the\nplan otherwise makes equitable provision on\nthe basis of need for facilities and services\nof like quality for each such population group\nin the area, and (b) such finding is sub-\nsequently approved by the Surgeon General,.\nFacilities provided under the Federal Act will\nbe considered as making equitable provision\nfor separate population groups when the\nfacilities to be built for the group less\nwell provided for heretofore are equal to\nthe proportion of such group in the total\npopulation of the area, except that the\nState plan shall not program facilities for\na separate population group for construction\nbeyond the level of adequacy for such group.\nA State, to participate in the program, is re-\nquired to submit for approval by the Surgeon General a state\nplan setting forth a \"hospital construction program\" which,\n4\n\n-5-\namong other things, \"meets the requirements as to lack\nof discrimination on account of race, creed,or color,\nrequired by the regulations prescribed under section\n291e(f). . . .\" (42 U.S.C. 291f(a)(4). The state may\nmeet this non-discrimination requirement \"in any area\nwhere separate hospital, dia-i!ostic or treatment center,\nrehabilitation or nursing home facilities, are provided\nfor separate population groups . • . if . . . the plan\notherwise makes equitable provision on the basis of need\nfor facilities and services of like quality for each such\npopulation group in the area, and. • . such finding is\nsubsequently approved by the Surgeon General.\" (Regulation\n52.112, 42 C, F. R., 53.112). !there a separate-but-equal\nplan is in operation, the individual applicant for aid need\nnot give any assurance that it will not discriminate and,\nin fact, expressly indicates on its application form that\n\"certain persons in this area will be denied admission to\nthe proposed facilities as patients because of race, creed,\n3/\nor color.\" (cid:9) The arrangement to extend aid is formally cone:\ncluded by a memorandum of agreement signed by representatives\nof the applicant, the state agency and the Surgeon General.\n3/(cid:9) There are, however, a multitude of requirements\nthat an applicant must meet to be approved by the state\nagency. For example, in approving any application the\nstate agency is required by regulation (42 C.F.R. 53.127(d))\nto certify that the application contains reasonable\nassurances as to title, payment of prevailing rates of\nwages, and financial support for the construction and\noperation of the project; that the plans and specifications\nfor construction of the project are in accord with the minimum\nconstruction standards in the Federal regulations; that the\napplication is in conformity with the State plan; that the\napplication contains an assurance that the applicant will\nconform to the requirements of sections 53.111. 53.112, and\n53.113 of the Regulations regarding the provision of facilities\nfor persons unable to pay therefore; that the application\ncontains an assurance that the applicant will conform to state\nstandards for operation and maintenance and to all appli-\ncable state laws and state and local regulations; that the\napplication is entitled to priority over other projects\nwithin the state; and that the state agency has approved the\napplication.\n\n-6-\nB.(cid:9) The Allegations of the Pleadings\nThe allegations of the complaint and of the\npleading in intervention may be summarized as follows:\nIn September 1946, the State of North Carolina,\nacting through the North Carolina i;edical Care Commission,\nfiled with the Public Health Service an application, pur-\nsuant to the Act, for federal funds to conduct a survey,\nof existing hospital and related facilities in North\nCarolina. The application was approved and, following an\nallotment of funds to the State, the North Carolina Medical\nCare Commission filed a state plan with the Public Health\nService. This plan was approved by the Surgeon 'General on\nJuly 8, 1947, and, with periodic revisions, has remained in\neffect to the time of the filing of the pleading in inter-\nvention.\nThe State plan provides for the division of\nGuilford County, North Carolina into two Hospital service\nareas, the Greensboro Hospital Service area and the High\nPoint Hospital service area. Greensboro is one of several\nhospital service areas where, pursuant to the State plan as\napproved by the Surgeon General, separate hospital facili-\nties are provided for separate population groups.\nPlaintiffs are Negro citizens of the United States\nand the State of North Carolina residing in the City of\nGreensboro. Certain of the plaintiffs are qualified medical\ndoctors and certain others are qualified dentists, all practic-\nini in Greensboro. This group of plaintiffs seeks admission\nto the staff facilities of Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital\nand Uesley Long Community Hospital.\nPlaintiffs A. J. Taylor and Donald R, Lyons are\nin need of medical treatment and desire to enter either the\n\n7\nWesley Lon- Community Hospital or the Moses H. Cone\nMemorial Hospital where complete medical equipment and\nthe best facilities for treatment in the Greensboro area\nare available. Plaintiffs also desire treatment from\ntheir personal physicians. Plaintiffs, however, cannot\nbe admitted to the Long Hospital since it follows a\npolicy, practice, custom and usage of refusing to admit\nNegroes to the use of its facilities. Plaintiffs cannot\nenter the Cone Hospital on the same basis as whites nor\ncan they enter the Cone Hospital and be treated by their\npersonal physicians because the Cone Hospital will not\nadmit Negro doctors or dentists to staff facilities.\nDefendants, Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, Inc.,\nand ?lesley Lon-- Community Hospital Inc., are North Carolina\ncorporations that have established and now maintain in\nGreensboro, North Carolina, the Noses H. Cone Memorial\nHospital and the Tiesley Long Community Hospital, respectively,\nwhich are tax exempt and state licensed. Defendant Harold\nBettis is the Director of the Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital\nInc. and defendant A. 0. Smith is the AdministratLr of the\nWesley Long Community Hospital.\nThe complaint and the pleading in intervention\nmake these allegations with respect to the functioning and\noperation of defendant hospitals:\n1.(cid:9) Of the fifteen members of the Board of\nTrustees of Cone Hospital, six are appointed by agents or\n4/\nsubdivisions of the State of North Carolina.\n4/(cid:9) Three members are appointed by the Governor of North\nCarolina; one member is named by the Board of Commissioners\nof the City of Greensboro; one member is named by the Board\nof Guilford County; one member is named by the Board of\nCommissioners of Watauga County.\n\n- 8 -\n2. One member of the Board of Trustees of Cone\nHospital is appointed by the Guilford County Medical Society -\n- a component of the Medical Society of North Carolina. The\nlatter body appoints the Board of Medical Examiners of North\nCarolina and elects four members of the State Board of Health.\n3. Cone Hospital conducts training and is regu-\nlarly used as a place of training for student nurses from\nthe Jomen's College of the University of North Carolina\nand the Agricultural and Training Colle.:e of North Carolina,\nboth of which are tax supported, public institutions.\n4. The Cone and Long Hospitals have received\nthe following amounts of federal funds under the Hill-\nBurton Act:\nCone Hospital:\n(a) $462,000.00 for new construction the estimated\ntotal cost of which is $5,277,023.00;\n(b) $697,950.00 for an addition and remodeling of\nthe General Hospital, the estimated total cost of which\nwas $1,850,000.00;\n(c) $110,000.00 for the construction of a diag-\nnostic and treatment center the estimated total cost of\n5/\nwhich was $240,000.00\n57(cid:9) The funds described in paragraph (a) above were requested\nin project application NC-86, dated June 17, 1950 and the funds\ndescribed in paragraphs (b) and (c) above were requested in\nproject applications NC-330, dated October 28, 1959.

The Long Hospital has not given assurances\nthat it will operate its facilities without discrimination\nbecause of race, creed, or color.\n7. Defendant Cone and Long Hospitals are\npursuing a policy, grounded on race, of barring physicians\n8/\nand dentists -- such as plaintiffs -- from staff privileges.\nIn addition, defendant Cone Hospital refuses to admit Negro\n9/\npatients on the same terms and conditions as white persons,\nand defendant Long Hospital refuses entirely to admit Negro\npatients to the use of its facilities. Plaintiffs allege\nthat this policy, practice, custom and usage violates their\nrights to the equal protection of the laws and due process\nof law as guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments\nto the Constitution of the United States.\nThe plaintiff physicians and dentists allege\nthat they are now suffering and will continue to suffer\nirreparable injury by the maintenance of defendants'\npolicy, practice, custom and usage as described in the\n8/(cid:9) All physsicians and dentist plaintiffs have applied for\nadmission to the staff of defendant Cone Hospital and have\nbeen rejected.

Declare 42 U.S.C. 291e(f) and Regulation\n58.112 unconstitutional.\n2. Enjoin defendants from continuin g to\nenforce their policy of denying admission to their\nmedical staffs on the grounds of race.\n3. Enjoin defendants from continuing to enforce\ntheir policy of denying admission to patients on the basis\nof race and in any way conditioning or abridging the\nadmission to, and use of, the facilities of Cone and\nLong Hospitals on the basis of race.\nThe United States joins with the plaintiffs in\nrequesting this Court to declare unconstitutional so much\nof section 291e(f) of Title 42 U.S.C. as authorizes the\nSurgeon General to prescribe regulations concerning\nseparate hospital facilities for separate population\ngroups. In addition, the United States asserts that the\nconduct of defendant hospitals attacked in this proceeding\nviolates the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution,\n\n- 12 -\nIi\nA RGUHBNT\nA.(cid:9) Introduction\nSince this case draws in question the con-\nstitutionality of an Act of Congress, the United States\nbelieves it is required, under 28 U.S.C. 2403, to state\nits position as to the constitutionality of the statute\nunder attach. Lie- recognize, of course, the self-imposed\njudicial inhibition against passing on the validity of\nan Act of Congress \"unless absolutely necessary to a\ndecision of the case.\" Burton v. United States, 196 U.S\n10/\n283, 295 (1905).(cid:9) However, we believe that if the Court\nconcludes that the conduct of the defendants is subject\nto constitutional limitations, it will, of necessity, be\nrequired to pass on the constitutionality of the separate-\nbut-equal provisions of the Hill-Burton Act. It is that\nAct which expressly sanctions the defendants' conduct, and\nit is that Act which expressly authorized the State of North\nCarolina to devise a hospital construction plan that dis-\ncriminates on the basis of race, in violation of the Four-\nteenth Amendment, jhere unlawful conduct appears to be ex-\npressly authorized by a statutory provision, we do not\nbelieve that, when the conduct is attacked, the Court can\navoid adjudicating the constitutionality of the provision\ninvolved.\n10/(cid:9) Cases are collected in the opinion of I,Ir. Justice\nBrandeis in Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority,\n297 U.S. 288, 345 et seq. (1936). See also United States\nv. Auto T!orkers, 352 U.S. 567, 589-593 (1957).\n\n- 13 -\nB.(cid:9) The Provision of the Hill-Burton Act\nSanctioninc; the Construction of\nSeparate-But-Equal Hospital\nFacilities is Unconstitutional\nThis case raises the question of whether the\nConstitution permits Congress to authorize expressly the\n\"separate-but-equal\" treatment of different racial groups\nin federal-state programs. The United States takes the\nposition that the Constitution does not condone such\ntreatment and that the \"separate-but-equal\" provisions of\nthe Hill-Burton Act are violative of the Fifth Amendment,\nand the action of a state in administering a \"separate-\nbut-equal\" hospital construction program is impermissible\nunder the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nIn the Hill-Burton Act, Congress has authorized\nfederal-state cooperation in a federally financed, state\nadministered program of hospital construction for the\nbenefit of all the people (42 U.S.C. 291(a)). Although\nthe Act specifically provides that state hospital construction\nprograms shall not discriminate \"on account of race, creed\nor color\", Congress has further prescribed that this non-\n-iscrimination standard may be met if the state program\nprovides for the construction of \"separate-but-equal\"\nfacilities. Thus, the Hill-Burton Act is not merely\nneutral or silent on the question of racia?. discrimination.\nRather, Congress incorporated into the statute a standard\nbased on race and has authorized and sanctioned racial\ndiscrimination by state-connected institutions -- racial\ndiscrimination that clearly violates the Fourteenth Amendment.\nCongress has no power, under the Fifth Amendment, to do this.\nFirst, section 29le(f) of Title 42 is, on its\nface, violative of the Constitution. That our Constitution\nprohibits the utilization of race as a yardstick in any\n\n- 14 -\ntype of governmental activity is now too well established\nto be questioned. Racial classifications are \"obviously\n11\nirrelevant and invidious.\" This principle was succinctly\nstated by Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting in Plessy v.\nFerguson, 163 U.S. 537, 559 (1896):\nOur Constitution is color-blind, and neither\nknows nor tolerates classes among citizens.\n* * * The law regards man as man, and takes\nno account of his surroundings or of his color\nwhen his civil rights as guaranteed by the\nsupreme law of the sand are involved. * * *\nSecond, the Hill-Burton Act expressly sanctions\nracial discrimination by state-connected institutions.\nIt is now beyond question that racial discrimination by\na state runs afoul of the Constitution since, \"for a\nstate to place its authority behind discriminatory treatment\nbased solely on color is indubitably a denial by a State\nof the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the\n12/\nFourteenth Amendment.\"(cid:9) Nevertheless, despite this clear\nprinciple, under the Act, the states are expressly authorized\nto devise hospital construction programs that provide separate\nfacilities for the races. The state program must be approved\nby the Surgeon General and he must determine whether the\nstate properly has applied the separate-but-equal formula.\nIn effect, therefore, the federal government takes a very\ndirect part in cooperating with the states in the effectuation\nof a separate-but-equal hospital pro-ram. This is state\nsponsored racial discrimination,w:ith a federal imprimatur.\n11/ Steele v. Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co.,\n323 U.S. 192, 203 (1944).\n12/ Mr. Justice Frankfurter, dissenting on other grounds\nin Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715,\n727 (1961).\n\n- 15 -\nFor Congress expressly to authorize such a scheme necessarily\n13/\nviolates the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\nCertainly, Congress has power to promote hospital construction,\nbut it cannot use that power \"to attain an unconstitutional\nresult.\" Uester.n Union Telegraph Co, v. Foster,(cid:9) 2447 U.S.\n105, 114 (1918). Cf, Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339\n(1960). With respect to a related field of federal activity,\nthe Supreme Court has said (United States v. Butler, 297 U.S.\n1, 74 (1936)):\nit is said that no one has doubted the\npower of Congress to stipulate the sort of\neducation for which money shall be expended.\n13/ In Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S, 497 (1954) the Court\nindicated that, with respect to racial discrimination, the\nreach of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment was\ncoextensive with that of the equal protection clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. The Court said (347 U.S. at 500):\n\"In view of our decision that the Constitution pro-\nhibits the states from maintaining racially segregated public\nschools, it would be unthinkable that the same Constitution\nwould impose a lesser duty on the Federal Government. We\nhold that racial segregation in the public schools of the\nDistrict of Columbia is a denial of the due process of law\nguaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\"\na \nSee also Steele v. Louisville  Nashville R.R. Co., 323 U.S\n192 (1944) where Justice Murphy, in a concurring opinion,\nstated (323 U.S. at 208):\n\"The Act [the Railway Labor Act] contains no\nlanguage which directs the manner in which the bargaining\nrepresentative shall perform his duties. But it cannot be\nassumed that Congress meant to authorize the representative\nto act so as to ignore rights guaranteed by the Constitution_.\nOtherwise the act would bear the stigma of unconstitutionality\n.render the Fifth Amendment i * this respect.\" Cf.\nu°flurd v. Hodge, 334 U.S. 24 (1948).\n\n-16 -\nBut an appropriation to an educational in-\nstitution which by its terms is to become\navailable only if the beneficiary enteres into\na contract to teach doctrines subversive to the\nConstitution is clearly bad. An affirmance of\nthe authority of Congress so to condition the\nexpenditure of an appropriation would tend to\nnullify all constitutional limitations upon\nlegislative power.\"\nThus, Congress may not enact legislation which\nexpressly sanctions state violations of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, for to do so is \"to attain an unconstitutional\n14/\nresult.\"\n1oreover, it is without significance that the\nHill-Burton Act does vot compel the states to devise\nseparate-but-equal hospital construction programs. It\nis enough that racial discrimination is permitted or\nsanctioned. Thus, the Kansas statute involved in Brown v.\nBoard of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954) permitted, but did\nnot require, cities of more than 15,000 population to main-\ntamn separate school facilities for Negro and white studenls.\n14/ In A4ing v. Horgan, 3 R.R.L. Rep. 693, 699 (Cal, Super. Ct.\n1958) the court held that private persons who accepted federal\nmortgage guarantees were bound by the Fifth Amendment. With\nregard to the absence of an explicit non-discrimination pro-\nvision in the act of Congress in issue, the court said:\nIf it be objected that Congress refused to so\nso ordain, it must be replied that Congress could\nnot ordain otherwise -- the law does not permit\nit to differentiate between races, and whether it\nexpresses that limitation in so many words or\nnot • . . .\n15/ Cf. McCabe v. Atchison, T, C\"> S.F. fly. Co„ 235 U.S.\n151 (1914) where the Supreme Court said that a statute was\n:invalid which affirmatively permitted, though it did not\nrequire, a railroad to provide unequal transportation\nfacilities for whites and Negroes.\n\n-' 17 -\nNor is it significant that the state plan involved in\nthis case does not cd(cid:9) ± individual hospitals to\ndiscriminate. The actions of the State of North Carolina\nin this case are sufficient to meet the tests of unconsti-\ntutional state action as set forth in Cooper v. Aaron,\n358 U.S. 1, 19 (1958) where the Court said:\n\"(cid:9) State support of segregated schools through\nany arrangement, management, funds, or property\ncannotbe squared with the [Fourteenth] Amendment's\ncommand that no State shall deny to any person\nwithin its ,jurisdiction the equal protection of\n:he laws. The right of a student not to be\nsegregated on racial grounds in schools so main-\ntained is indeed so fundamental and pervasive\nthat it is embraced in the concept of due process 16/\nof law. trolling v. Sharpe, 347.\" (Emphasis added\n See Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S.\n715. 725 (1961) where the Court held that a State cannot\navoid its responsibilities under the Fourteenth Amendment\nby entering into leasing arrangements and said:\n\"?hut no State may effectively abdicate its\nresponsibilities by either ignoring them or by\nmerely failing to discharge them whatever the\nmotive may be. It is of no consolation to an\nindividual denied the equal protection of the\nlaws that it was done in good faith . . . By\nits inaction, the Authority, and through it\nthe State, has not only made itself a party to\nthe refusal of service, but has elected to place\nits power, property and prestige, behind the\nadmitted discrimination, (Emphasis added).

United States, 189 F. 2d 476 (C.A. 5, 1951).\n\n- 18-\nNor cars the constitutionality of the separate-\nbut-equal provisions of 42 U.S.C. 291e(f) and Regulation\n53.112 and the hospital construction plan of the State of\nNorth Carolina be sustained on the ground that they do not\ndiscriminate against any race but expressly provide for\nseparate but equal treatment. While no case has been\nfound which specifically holds that state aided hospitals\n17/\nmay not be operated on a separate but equal basis, (cid:9) it\nis clear that the separate but equal doctrine has been\nthoroughly repudiated and may no longer be applied. That\ndoctrine had its birth prior to the adoption of the\nFourteenth Amendment in the decision of a Massachusetts\nState Court relating to public schools. Robert v. City of\nBoston, 59 Mass. 198 (1849). The doctrine of that case was\nfollowed in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896) where\nthe Supreme Court held as to intrastate commerce that a\nLouisiana statute, requiring railway companies to provide\nequal but separate accommodations for the white and colored\nraces was not in conflict with the provisions of the\nFourteenth Amendment.\nHowever, in Morgan v. Virginia, 328 U.S. 373\n(1946) the Court held that a state statute requiring\nsegregated seats for Negro passengers on interstate buses\nwas an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.\nIn Henderson v. United States, 339 U.S. 816 (1950), the\nCourt held that interstate railroad regulations and\n17/ Greenberg, Race Relations and American Law 90 offers\nthis explanation for the few cases dealing with hospital\nsegregation: \"But a paucity of cases on the duty of\nhospitals with respect to race probably stems from the\nfact that persons requiring hospitalization usually are\nin no position to litigate. They have to care for their\nillnesses where and as soon as they can; potential litiga-\ntion then becomes moot.\"\n\n- 19 -\npractices assigning a separate table in a dining car to\nNegroes contravened the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.\n81 et seq. The Court referred to the statutory right as\n\"a fundamental right of equality of treatment,\" and cited\ncases construing the Fourteenth Amendment, id at 825,\nthough the Court did not reach the constitutional question.\nThe reasoning applied was similar to that employed in\nShelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 22 (1948) where the Court\nrecognized that the underlying philosophy of the Fourteenth\nAmendment is the equality before the law of each individual.\nSee also Bailey v.

It is clear, therefore, that Congress may not\nenact a statute authorizing a hospital construction program\nbased on a separate-but-equal formula, and a state may not\nadminister such a program. In view of this, the United\nStates is compelled to concede the unconstitutionality of\nthe separate-but-equal provision of the Hill-Burton Act\n20/\nand the regulation enacted pursuant thereto.(cid:9) We be-\nlieve the proper Constitutional standard was enunciated in\nHirabayashi v.

Rev. 131, 162, 163 (1950); Flack, Adoption of the\nFourteenth Amendment.\n22/ The interrelationship between governmental and\nprivate activity was aptly described by Chief Justice\nVinson in American Communications Ass'n v, Douds, 339\nU.S. 382, 401 (1950) where he wrote: \". . . when author-\nity derives in part from Government's thumb on the scales,\nthe exercise of that power by private persons becomes\nclosely akin, in some respects, to its exercise by Govern-\nment itself.\"\n\n- 23 -\nHere the racially discriminatory conduct\n23/\noccurred in hospitals heavily supported by public monies.\nThese hospitals are licensed by the State of North Caro-\nlina and receive the substantial benefit of being exempt\nfrom city and county taxes. Both hospitals received\ntheir financial aid pursuant to a hospital construction\nplan prepared by the North Carolina Medical Care Commis-\nsion which specifically authorized the expenditure of\npublic monies on a separate but equal basis, Each hospi-\ntal applied directly to the Medical Care Commission for\nfinancial aid; each hospital had its application reviewed\nand approved by the Commission; each hospital entered into\na memorandum of understanding with the Commission and the\nSurgeon General of the United States. Of the fifteen\nmembers of the Board of Trustees of Cone Hospital, six\nare appointed by agents or subdivisions of the State and\none is appointed by a quasi-governmental body. In addi-\ntion, Cone Hospital cooperates with tax supported public\ncolleges and universities of North Carolina in a nurses\ntraining program.\nThe Fourteenth Amendment's applicability to\nthis case does not depend upon whether each of the varied\naspects of state involvement are alone sufficient to\nsatisfy the \"state action\" requirements of that Amendment.\nRather, state involvement must be viewed as a totality --\nas the sum of various related activities. Here, we believe,\nthe state \"has so far insinuated itself into a position\n23/ Long Hospital has been authorized to receive almost\ntwo million dollars in public monies -- fifty percent of\nits construction requirements. Cone Hospital has been\nauthorized to receive over a million dollars in public\nmonies -- fifteen percent of its construction requirements.\n\n- 24 -\n24/\nof interdependence with\" the defendant hospitals that\naccess to the hospitals x- both as staff members and\npatients -- must be accorded without racial discrimina-\ntion. Indeed, we think it plain that the prohibitions\nof the Fourteenth Amendment have been held binding in\nsituations where state participation might be deemed less\ndirect and substantial than it is here.\nOnly recently, the Supreme Court had before it\nthe problem of determining whether the state had become\nso involved in private conduct as to make the action of\nprivate individuals subject to the Fourteenth Amendment.\nIn holding that a private restaurant operating in a public\nbuilding under a lease from a public authority could not\nengage in racial discrimination, the Court noted (Burton\nv. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715, 722 (1961):\nOnly by sifting facts and weighing\ncircumstances can the nonobvious involve-\nment of the State in private conduct be\nattributed its true significance. 25/\n24/ Burton v, [Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715,\n725 (1962).\n25/ Even before Burton there was a large body of case law\nwhich proscribed discrimination by a lessee of public\nproperty or facilities. See Muir v. Louisville Park\nTheatrical Association, 347 U,S, 971 (1954), vacating and\nremanding, 202 F. 2d 275 (C.A. 6, 1953) (leased open air\ntheater); Aaron v, Cooper, 261 F. 2d 97 (C.A. 8, 1958)\n(leased school); City of Greensboro v. Simkins, 246 F. 2d\n425 (C.A. 4, 1957), affirming, 149 F. Supp, 562 (M.D.\nN.C. 1957) (leased golf course); Derrington v. Plummer,\n240 F. 2d 922 (C,A. 5, 1956), cert. denied, 353 U.S. 924\n(1957) (leased cafeteria); Coke V. City of Atlanta, 184\nF. Supp. 579 (N.D. Ga. 1960) (leased airport restaurant);\nJones v. Marva Theatres, 180 F. Supp. 49 (D. Md. 1960)\n(leased motion picture theatre); Tate v„ Department of\nConservation, 133 F. Supp. 53 (E.D. Va, 1955), affirmed,\n231 F. 2d 615 (C.A. 4, 1956), cert. denied, 352 U.S. 838\n(1956) (leased beach); Nash v. Air Terminal Services, 85\nF. Supp. 545 (E.D. Va. 1949) (leased airport restaurant);\nLawrence v. Hancock, 76 F. Supp. 1004 (S.D. U. Va. 1948)\n(leased swimming pool). Although these decisions are\nrested on various grounds -- in some, that the lease was\na technique of evading state responsibility; in others,\nthat the property, though privately operated, was being\nused for a public purpose -- they have been uniform in\nreaching the conclusion that the discrimination effectuated\nby the private lessee was constitutionally forbidden.\n\n- 25 -\nIn many other areas the courts have also sifted\nfacts and weighed circumstances so as not to permit con-\nduct to escape the fall-out of the Fourteenth Amendment\nmerely by sheltering under the cloak of \"private action.\"\nThus, in the Girard College Case, Pennsylvania v. Board\nof Directors of City Trusts, 353 U.S. 230 (1957), the\ndiscrimination (in that case, against Negro applicants\nfor admission to Girard College) stemmed from the fact\nthat an individual had placed :Limitations upon the use\nof monies which he had placed in a private trust. A state\nagency was involved in the matter as trustee, i.e., it\nwas engaged in carrying out the trust in accordance with\nits terms. The Supreme Court nevertheless concluded that\nthe action of the trustee was \"discrimination by the State\"\n(353 U.S. at 231). This case thus illustrates the general\nprinciple that what is material and decisive, for pur-\nposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, is that the state\n26/\nhas chosen to place its power behind the discrimination.\nIf a state cannot participate in the administration of\na private trust which draws racial distinctions, as the\nGirard case holds, it follows, we believe, that it cannot\nparticipate in a vast hospital program which involves\ndiscrimination on the basis of race.\nThere are also other instances in which osten-\nsibly private actions have been found to have sufficient\nnexus with governmental action to justify use of the\n26/ \",(cid:9)  ,  Under some circumstances state contact, con-\ntrol and encouragement may be so intimately fused with\nthe activities of a private group or individual in the\nperformance of a public function that it seems fair to\ncall the activity 'state action' . . , ,\" Shanks,\n\"State Action\" and the Girard Estate Case, 105 U, of Pa.\nL.

A labor organization\nthat attains this privileged position may not make \"dis-\ncriminations based on race alone [which) are obviously\nirrelevant and invidious.\" Steele v, Louisville & Nash-\nville R.R.

Howard, 343 U,S, 763, 774 (1952) the Supreme\nCourt said:\nBargaining agents who enjoy the advantages\nof the Railway Labor Act's provisions must\nexecute their trust without lawless invasions\nof the rights of other workers„ 30/\nAnd in Railway Employers' Dept, v Hanson, 351 U.S. 225\n(1956), the Court emphasized the consequences of conduct\nundertaken pursuant to federal law. There the respondents\ncontended, inter alia, that union shop agreements, speci-\nfically permitted by the Railway Labor Act, operated to\ndeprive them of rights secured by the First and Fifth\nAmendments. In the course of its opinion holding that\nno rights were infringed upon, the Court said (351 U.S.\nat 232):\nIf private rights are being invaded, it\nis by force of an agreement made pursuant to\nfederal law which expressly declares that\nstate law is superseded. „ • • In other\nwords, the federal statute is the source of\nthe power and authority by which any private\nrights are lost or sacrificed. . • . The\nenactment of the federal statute authorizing\nunion shop agreements is the governmental\naction on which the Constitution operates,\nthough it takes a private agreement to in-\nvoke the federal sanction.\n30/ See also Syres v.

Board of\nManagers of James Ualker Memorial Hospital, 261 F. 2d\n251 (C,A, 4, 1958), cert. denied, 359 U.S. 984 (1959)\nrequires a conclusion in this case contrary to that\nsuggested by the cases discussed above. The elements\nof state contact in the Eaton case were far less per-\nvasive than they are here. For example:\n1,(cid:9) In Eaton, none of the members of the\nBoard of Managers of James i''alher F.temorial Hospital were\n31,\nappointed by governmential agencies;(cid:9) here, seven of\nthe fifteen members of the Board of Trustees of Cone\nHospital are appointed by governmental or quasi-governmental\nbodies, a factor especially significan±:. in the light of the\nSupreme Court's decision in Pennsylvania v. Board of Directors\nof City Trusts, supra.\n2. Ualker Hospital did not participate in an\narrangement with tax supported public colleges and uni-\nversities of the State of North Carolina for the training\nof nurses, as does Cone Hospital.\n3. In Eaton, all governmental aid and assistance\nin the construction of facilities and the acquisition of\nproperty ended in 1901; here substantial assistance\ncontinues to this day.\n31/ This factor was expressly noted by the district\ncourt which said (164 F. Supra, 191, 193 (E.D. N.C. 1958)):\n\". • . no member of the City or County government is now\na member of the Board or in any way in charge of the\naffairs of James Ualker 2iemorial Hospital.\"\n\n- 29 -\n4. In Eaton, the revenues derived from\ngovernmental sources in the six years preceeding the\nlaw suit amounted to 4.5 per cent of the hospitals\ntotal income; here, the Long Hospital has been authorized\nto receive almost $2,000,000.00 in public monies-about\n50% of its construction requirements, while Cone hospital\nhas been authorized to receive over $1,000,000.00 in\npublic monies - about 15% of its construction requirements.\n5. But the most significant distinction be-\ntween the Eaton case and the present case is the total\nabsence in the former of any discussion or analysis of\nthe relationship between \"alker Hospital and the Hill-Burton\n2/\nhospital program.(cid:9) In this respect, the present case presents\nan entirely different picture. The Cone and Long hospitals\nhave been involved in a state plan designed to develop\nprograms of hospital construction to make possible adequate\nservices to all people. These hospitals affirmatively chose\nto participate in this state program. They applied for\nIn fact, James i''alker I emorial Hospital has not received\nfinancial assistance under the Hill-urton Act. See Hospital\nand Medical Facilities Project Register, (December 31, 1961)\npublished by the Public Health Service Division of Health\nand Medical Facilities.\n\n-- 30 -\nfinancial assistance and, as a condition for receiving\nsuch assistance, gave numerous assurances to the State\n33/\nand to the Surgeon General. These assurances, and the\nconcomitant obligations arising from the receipt of large\namounts of federal aid, removed the almost unlimited freedom\nof management that was present in the Eaton case. Here also\nthe discriminatory policy attacked is one expressly sanctioned\nby federal law and abetted by state planning. Certainly,\nthrough the Hill-Burton Act, governmental power and authority\nhas sufficiently insinuated itself into the affairs of the\ndefendant hospitals as to provide a decisive distinction\n34/\nfrom the Eaton case.\n33/ For example, tine defendant hospitals have given assurances\nthat they will accept indigent patients, thus carrying out a\npublic obligation. In Eaton, indigent patients were treated\nmerely on a contract basis.\n34/ Even in Eaton, the district court recognized that every\ncase must be evaluated on its own terms. Thus, the court said\n(164 F. Supp. at 196): \"when considering the ability to con-\ntrol, it must be noted that it is a composite of elements, :nor\nthere are as many elements of 'control as there are qualities.\nand quanties in the controlled subject,. The elements must re\nviewed in their relationship to each other and as part of a\nsum total, and for this reason each case must be viewed on\nits• rlerits.\"\n\nl\n- 31 -\nFinally, while we believe that the involvement\nof governmental power and authority in the defendants'\nactivities is sufficient to require the defendant hos-\npitals to conform to the commands of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, we are also persuaded that where, as here,\nan institution is of a public nature, affecting the\ncommunity at large, such an institution is \"a public\nfacility in which there can be no more discrimination\nbased on race than is constitutionally permissible in\nthe more customary types of public facility.\" (Mr.\nJustice Douglas concurring in Garner v. Louisiana, 368\nU.S. 157, 183 (1961)). Courts have long recognized that\nrestrictions properly could be placed on activities\naffected with a public interest. See Munn v. Illinois,\n94 U.S. 113 (1876); Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502\n(1934); Marsh v. Alabama, supra; Boman v. Birmingham\n35/\nTransit Co., 280 F. 2d 531 (C.A. 5, 1960).(cid:9) In the Garner\ncase, supra, Mr. Justice Douglas, in a concurring opinion,\nconcluded that such restrictions should be extended to\n36/\na retail establishment under permit from a municipality.\n35/ Lord Chief Justice Hale stated in De Portibus Maris,\nI Harg. Law Tracts 78, \". . . if a man set out a street\nin new building on his land, it is now no longer bare\nprivate interest, but is affected with a public interest.\"\n36/ Mr. Justice Douglas relied heavily on the fact that\nthe retail establishments were licensed by the state (as\nare the hospitals in this case). He wrote (Garner v.\nLouisiana, supra at 184-85):\nI do not believe that a State that\nlicenses a business can license it to serve\nonly whites or only blacks or only yellows\nor only browns. Race is an impermissible\nclassification when it comes to parks or\nother municipal facilities by reason of\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment. By the same token, I\ndo not see how a State can constitutionally\nexercise its licensing power over business\neither in terms or in effect to segregate\nthe races in the licensed premises. The\n(continued)\n\nJ\n— 32 —\nIt is particularly appropriate to view a non-\nprofit hospital as an institution affected with a public\ninterest, As the memorandum of the General Counsel of\nthe Department of Health, Education and Welfare (attached\nhereto as an appendix) reveals, non—profit hospitals\nhave a decidedly public character. This memorandum\n36/(cid:9) (continued)\nauthority to license a business for public\nuse is derived from the public. Negroes\nare as much a part of that public as are\nwhites. A municipality granting a license\nto operate a business for the public repre-\nsents Negroes as well as all other races\nwho live there. A license to establish\na restaur:a±' '.s °a licene , to establish a\npublic facility and necessarily imports, in\nlaw, equality of use for all members of the\npublic, I see no way whereby licenses\nissued by a State tot. serve the public can\nbe distinguished from leases of public\nfacilities (Burton v, Wilmington Parking\nAuthority, supra) for that end.\nOne can close the doors of his home to\nanyone he desires. But one who operates\nan enterprise under-.a license from the\ngovernment enjoys a privilege that derives\nfrom the people. Whether retail stores,\nnot licensed by the municipality, stand\non a different footing is not presented\nhere, But the necessity of a license\nshows that the public has rights in respect\nto those premises. The business is not\na matter of mere private concern, Those\nwho license enterprises for public use\nshould not have under our Constitution\nthe power to license it for the use of\nonly one race. For there is the over-\nriding constitutional requirement that\nall state power be exercised so as not\nto deny equal protection to any group.\nAs the first Mr. Justice Harlan stated\nin dissent in P lessy v. Ferguson, supra,\nat 559, \". • • in view of the Constitution,\nin the eye of the law, there is in this\ncountry no superior, dominant, ruling\nclass of citizens. There is no caste\nhere. Our constitution is color blind\ntt\n\n- 33 -\nindicates that while there are 2,276 accredited private\nnon-profit hospitals in the United States, there are\nonly 524 governmental and 154 proprietary (profit-\nmaking) accredited hospitals. The governmental hospitals\n\"differ little from private non-profit hospitals except\nin the manner of selection of the governing boards,\nand sometimes in having a call upon tax funds to meet\ndeficits.\" Both governmental and non-profit hospitals\nserve as general community hospitals. Such \"community\nhospitals have become essential, both to provide hospi-\ntal service to the people of the community and to enable\nits physicians to practice good medicine.\" Hence non-\nprofit hospitals perform a vital function which would\notherwise have to be performed by the state. It is not,\ntherefore, inappropriate to include such hospitals\n371\nwithin the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment. Only\nrecently a court suggested that schools and colleges,\n\"no matter how 'private' they may claim to be,\" are\nso affected with the public interest as to be bound by\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, in Guillory v. Adminis-\ntrators of Tulane University, 30 L.W. 2469 (E.D. La.,\n1962), the court said:\n37/ Here the State of North Carolina has chosen to make\nadequate hospital service available to all of its people\nby designating, throughout the State, public and private\nnon-profit hospitals as recipients of federal aid. The\ndefendant hospitals are among those designated, and are\nthus among the instrumentalities selected by the State\nfor the effectuation of its purpose -- a purpose that\nincludes, \nand must include, Negroes on the same terms\nas whites. Before the Brown decision, North Carolina\nwas free to achieve its purpose through separate insti-\ntutions for the two races; today, plainly it is not.\nUnder no circumstances, however, do we believe that the\nFourteenth Amendment permits a state, through the device\nof using private institutions to discharge a public func-\ntion, to relieve itself or the institutions of such re-\nsponsibility as is cast upon a state by the Equal Protection\nClause. Today, that responsibility is incompatible with\nracial segregation.\n\n– 34\nAt the outset, one may question whether\nany school or college can ever be so 'private'\nas to escape the reach of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. In a country dedicated to the\ncreed that education is the only 'Sutd\nfoundation * * *of freedom,' 'withotit\nwhich no republic can maintain itself in\nstrength,' institutions of learning\nare not things of purely private concern.\nNo one any longer doubts that education is\na matter affected with the public interest.\nAnd this is true whether it is offered by a\npublic or private institution. . . . Clearly,\nthe administrators of a private college are\nperforming a public function. They do the\nwort, of the state, often in the place of the\nstate. Does it not follow that they stand\nin the state's shoes? And, if so, are they\nnot then agents of the state, subject to the\nconstitutional restraints on governmental\naction, to the same extent as private persons\nwho zovern a company town, Marsh v. Alabama,\n326 U.S. 501, or control a political party,\nTei;-y v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461, or run a city street\ncar and bus service, Public Utilities Comm'n.\nv. Pollak, 343 U.S. 451; Doman v.

Morgan, 5 Cir., 287 F. 2d 750,\n29 L.JC.(cid:9) 2389?\nReason and authority strongly suggest that\nthe Constitution never sanctions racial dis-\ncrimination in our schools and colleges, no\nmatter how 'private' they may claim to be.\nSinilarly ; we believe that the Constitution forbids\nnon—profit hospitals, serving such essential and far reaching\ncommunity needs, to be infected with the virus of racial\ndiscrimination.\nRespectfully submitted,\nBURglE MARSHALL,\nAssistant Attorney General.\n_Tilliam H.

The American Hospital\nAssociation listing for 1960 shows nonfederal short-term\ngeneral (and \"other special\"*) hospitals divided as follows:\nInstitutions Beds\nGovernmental(cid:9) (Listed 1,260(cid:9) 156,000\n(Accredited** 524(cid:9) 121,000\nPrivate nonprofit\n(Listed 3,291(cid:9) 446,000\n(Accredited 2,276(cid:9) 403,000\nProprietary(cid:9) (Listed(cid:9) 856(cid:9) 37,000\n(Accredited(cid:9) 154(cid:9) 14,000\nGovernmental hospitals are for the most part\nowned by counties, municipalities, or in some States\nhospital districts. Except for State university hospitals,\nState institutions are generally confined to mental,\ntuberculosis or other specialized hospitals. County\nand municipal hospitals include some, mostly in the larger\ncities, that are operated exclusively or primarily for\nindigents who are expected to pay little or nothing for\ntheir care. Most governmental general hospitals, however,\noperate in much the same fashion as private nonprofit\ninstitutions, described below. These 'governmental\ninstitutions serve as general community hospitals,\naccept paying patients, and grant staff privileges to\nlocal physicians who bill their patients as private\npractitioners. These hospitals differ little from\nprivate nonprofit hospitals except in the manner of\nselection of the governing boards, and sometimes in having\n*/ E.G., pediatric hospitals and maternity hospitals.\nFigures do not include psychiatric hospitals.

The older hospitals\nwere organized, frequently under religious auspices,\nprimarily as institutions for care of the sick poor. With\nthe tremendous growth of curative medicine in the last\nforty years and its increasing concentration in the\nhospital, these older institutions, and their modern cou_.,ter-\nparts both public and nonprofit, have become centers for\nthe care of the entire population, and thus centers for\nthe practice of medicine in its treatment of the seriously\nill. Not only does the hospital provide the attending\nphysician with expert nursing care of his patient, but it\nsupplies also a wide range of ancillary services and\nfacilities. Operating and delivery rooms and at least\nminimal laboratory and X-ray services are found in all\ncommunity general hospitals; the larger and better hospitals\nplace a great and ever-growing complex of professional,\nsubprofessional and technical services at the disposal of\nthe clinician. Typically the hospital employs or con-\ntracts with medical specialists to head pathology,\nradiology, and sometimes other departments; but typically\nthe care of the individual patient is the responsibility\nof a private practitioner who enjoys staff privileges but\nhas no financial relationship with the hospital.\nStaff privileges, classified and sometimes\ngraduated in accordance with the qualifications of the\nindividual physician, are granted by the governing board\non recommendation of the medical staff or a staff com-\nmittee. Membership on a hospital staff has become\nessential to the practice of many branches of medicine,\n\nr\n39 -\nand the interchange it provides is also an important\nelement in the continuing professional education of the\npractitioner. The organized medical staff of a hospital,\nand its committees that review the work of individual\npractitioners, constitute for most physicians the single\nexception to the individualistic pattern of practice which\nhas been traditional in the medical profession.\nThe larger hospitals, both governmental and non-\nprofit, perform substantial educational functions, most\nnotably in graduate medical education and in the training\nof professional nurses, These teaching hospitals are\ngenerally regarded as providing, by and large, the highest\nquality of care. A hospital internship has become an\nalmost universal prerequisite to medical practice, and a\nresidency is essential to qualification as a specialist.\nEighty-five per cent of the registered nurses of the\ncountry are produced by hospital schools of nursing. Some\nhospitals also train practical nurses, laboratory techni-\ncians, and a number of other paramedical groups. Although\nstudent services are availed of by the hospitals in vary-\ning degree, these educational activities incur substantial\nnet deficits which are generally recouped by charging\npaying patients somewhat more than the immediate cost of\nservices to them.\nNonprofit hospitals are controlled by governing\nboards which usually either are self-perpetuating or are\nselected by religious bodies with which hospitals are\naffiliated. The hospitals and their property are widely\nexempted from taxation. For purposes of the Federal\nincome tax, including deductibility of gifts to them, they\nare classified as charitable institutions. States and\nlocalities almost universally exempt these hospitals from\n of Statewide plans was an important\nt\nState. This requiremen\ninnovation, bringing a measure of order into what had\nr, 7(cid:9) +1-(cid:9) ..,.. - -- -\n\n- 41 -\nequaled in volume the construction aided by the program).\nAlthough State construction programs were re-\nquired to establish priorities in accordance with Federal\nAtandards based primarily on the relative shortage of\nfacilities, in some other respects the States were left\na free hand in selecting the projects to be aided.\nSpecifically, as between a public and a nonprofit project\nin a given community, or as between competing nonprofit\nprojects, the State was made the arbiter; in those States\nthat provided racially separate facilities, the option to\napprove \"separate but equal\" hospitals for Federal aid was\nleft to the State.\nTo summarize:\n1. Community hospitals have become essential,\nboth to provide hospital service to the people of the com-\nmunity and to enable its physicians to practice good\nmedicine.\n2. The functions of such hospitals can be, and\nare, performed equally well by governmental and by private\nnonprofit institutions. Not only do the two kinds of insti-\ntutions perform the same community functions, but they do so\nin the same way and with the same relationships to their\npatients and to the practicing profession. They enjoy\nthe \nsubstantially  same freedom from taxation, and often\nthe same or similar support from public funds. Such\ndifferences as there may be in the make-up of the govern-\ning boards or in the financial structure are usually all\nbut invisible to patients or to physicians.\n3. The Hill-Burton Act recognizes the inter-\nchangeability of public and nonprofit community hospitals\nand aids the two on the same terms, leaving the choice\nin each individual case to the community and the State.\n\n- 42 -\nThe State plan must be addressed to the provision of\nadequate facilities for all of the people of the State,\nbiat effectuation of the plan may be through any combina-\ntion of public and nonprofit institutions. Each institu-\ntion must be open to all people of the community unless\nthe State elects to approve \"separate but equal\" facilities\nfor separate groups.",
