    "summary": "<p>On January 16, 2007, two recipients of federal benefits under the Section 8 Housing Voucher Program and a non-profit advocacy organization filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The plaintiff sued the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA) under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The case was assigned to Judge George H. Wu. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, claimed that the Authority had violated due process by altering housing benefits to voucher recipients without adequate notice. The plaintiff claimed that HACLA violated six due process and federal regulations by failing to provide proper notice of Section 8 rent increases, which would affect approximately 22,000 tenants receiving federal benefits.</p><p>The Section 8 Housing Voucher Program was designed to aid low-income families in acquiring housing by subsidizing private landlords who rented to low-income tenants. In 2004, the defendant proposed cutting back on these federal subsidies in order to meet a federally-set budget. The changes were announced publicly, and would not take effect until April 2005. Individual tenants would not be subject to new regulations until their next annual evaluation, unless they moved before that time.</p><p>In November 2007, the court granted in part and denied in part a motion to dismiss. 2007 WL 9658205. Plaintiffs then filed a First Amended Complaint alleging violations of (1) due process of law under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, (2) rights created by 42 U.S.C. § 1437f, the Fair Housing Act (FHA), (3) Cal. Gov. Code § 815.6, (4) due process of law under Art. 1, § 7 of the California Constitution, and (5) negligence. The court dismissed the second and fifth claims and later granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the remaining claims. 2009 WL 10678033. </p><p>Plaintiffs appealed and Judge Percy Anderson of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal of the fifth claim and the grant of summary judgment on the first, third, and fourth claims. 425 Fed.Appx. 539. On remand, the district court granted HACLA’s renewed motion for summary judgment. The Ninth Circuit again reversed, holding that the flyer sent by HACLA did not provide sufficient notice of the voucher program change.  Specifically, the court held that this “failure violated both the requirements of the Voucher Program and regulations and the requirements of procedural due process.” 806 F. 3d 1178. The matter was remanded but included instructions to the district court to enter summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on the matters of federal and state law at issue on appeal. </p><p>In November 2015, HACLA petitioned the Ninth Circuit for rehearing en banc which the court denied in January 2016. 806 F. 3d 1178. HACLA subsequently petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari which was denied in October 2016. 137 S.Ct. 52.  </p><p>Following remand, the court certified two classes: (1) an injunctive relief class and (2) a damages class. The Injunctive Relief Class consisted of all Section 8 voucher recipients whose benefits were administered by HACLA and who in the past received, or in the future may receive, notice of decreased benefits. The Damages Class consisted of HACLA Section 8 tenants, between June 1, 2005 and September 30, 2006, whose rental contribution was greater than it would have been if not for HACLA’s 2004 decrease in benefits. The Damages Class consisted of 11,870 tenants. </p><p>In February 2017, the parties filed cross-motions for partial summary judgment as to remedies. Before the court ruled on these motions, the parties filed a stipulation for settlement. On February 15, 2018, the court granted final approval of the settlement agreement. 2018 WL 1659984. The settlement included attorneys’ fees and other fees (approximately $3.5 million total), a $6 million fund for the damages class, a three-year injunction that required HACLA to: <ul> </p><p><li>Notify all Section 8 tenants in plain language of a known, likely, or potential reduction in benefits</li></p><p><li>Notify Class Counsel of any reduction in benefits</li></p><p><li>Communicate with all Section 8 tenants in plain language regarding anything related to the Settlement Agreement</li></ul></p><p>In return for the injunction and monetary award, the plaintiffs agreed to release the defendant from all claims potentially arising out of the facts alleged in the complaint. The district court will retain jurisdiction over the settlement until 2021. </p><p>As of May 26, 2020, there has been no further docket activity. </p>",

In 2015, following years of litigation, appeals, and remand, the district court granted class certification to plaintiffs.  The parties finally reached a settlement agreement in 2017 which the district court approved. The settlement included a class award of approximately $9.5 million (including attorneys' fees) and a three-year injunction requiring HACLA to clearly communicate any future reduction of benefits in plain language to all voucher recipients and class counsel. The district court will retain jurisdiction over the case until February 2021. ",

Wu, District Judge, Presiding \nArgued and Submitted December 8, 2010 \nPasadena, California \nBefore: TROTT and WARDLAW, Circuit Judges, and MOSMAN, District \nJudge.** \n*  This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent \nexcept as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3. \n**  The Honorable Michael W. Mosman, United States District Judge for \nthe District of Oregon, sitting by designation. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 132   Filed 05/23/11   Page 3 of 7   Page ID #:873\nPlaintiffs Michael N ozzi and N idia Pelaez, putative class representatives of \nrecipients of federal housing assistance payments under the Section 8 Housing \nVoucher Program, 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o), and the Los Angeles Coalition to End \nHunger and Homelessness (collectively \"plaintiffs\") appeal the district court's \ndismissal of two claims and grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants \nHousing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (\"HACLA\"), which administers the \nSection 8 Program, and its Executive Director, Rudolph Montiel, on other claims \narising from defendants' failure to provide adequate notice of its planned reduction \nof the voucher payment standard (\"VPS\"), which is used to calculate plaintiffs' \nmonthly housing assistance payments.  Because the district court incorrectly \napplied well-established law to conclude that plaintiffs asserted no property \ninterest to which due process attached, and because genuine issues of material fact \nexist as to whether the notice HACLA provided satisfied the requirements of due \nprocess, we affirm in part and reverse in part. \n1.  Perhaps misconstruing plaintiffs' § 1983 due process claim, the district \ncourt improperly concluded that plaintiffs' property interest in Section 8 benefits \ndid not require adequate notice that their benefits were subject to the planned \nreduction.  Although the district court based this conclusion on its determination \nthat plaintiffs could not claim a property interest in the § 982.505 notice \n2 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 132   Filed 05/23/11   Page 4 of 7   Page ID #:874\nrequirement, plaintiffs' claim does not depend on finding a \"right to notice.\" \nRather, plaintiffs claim that they are statutorily entitled to benefits under Section 8, \nand that the statute in tandem with the regulatory requirements \"restrict[ing] the \ndiscretion\" of HACLA, Griffeth v. Detrich, 603 F .2d 118, 121 (9th Cir. 1979), \ncreates a property interest in Section 8 benefits to which constitutional due process \nattaches.  See Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 599-603 (1972) (citing Bd. of \nRegents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564 (1972)) (a legitimate claim of entitlement derived \nfrom a statute, rule, regulation, or de facto protocol gives rise to a federally \nprotected property interest).  Moreover, because it is beyond dispute that \"property \ninterests ... extend well beyond actual ownership,\" Roth, 408 U.S. at 571-72, the \ndistrict court erred in concluding that plaintiffs \"can only [have] a property interest \nin property.\"  See, e.g., Ressler v. Pierce, 692 F.2d 1212, 1215 (9th Cir. 1982) \n(finding that applicants have a federally protected property interest in receiving \nbenefits); Griffeth, 603 F .2d at 121 (same). \nThe controlling authority establishes that Section 8 participants have a \nproperty interest in housing benefits by virtue of their \"membership in a class of \nindividuals whom the Section 8 program was designed to benefit.\"  Ressler, 692 \nF.2d at 1215.  Because the Section 8 regulations \"closely circumscribe\" HACLA's \ndiscretion - by prohibiting HACLA from immediately implementing a reduced \n3 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 132   Filed 05/23/11   Page 5 of 7   Page ID #:875\nVPS, and requiring HACLA to inform participants that a reduced VPS will be \nimplemented- plaintiffs' property interest is protected against avoiding an abrupt \nand unexpected change in benefits.  ld.; see also Geneva Towers Tenants Org. v. \nRomney, 504 F.2d 483, 490 (9th Cir. 1974) (finding that plaintiffs' protected \nproperty interest in low-income housing included an expectation \"that rents will be \nkept as low as economically feasible\" where an entity's discretion to increase rent \nwas limited and plaintiffs clearly fell within the category of intended beneficiaries \nof the federal assistance program). \nWhat process is due to protect plaintiffs' well-settled property interest in \ntheir Section 8 benefits is controlled by the factors set forth in Mathews v. \nEldridge, 424 U.S. 319,335 (1976).  Upon remand, the district court shall apply \nthe Mathews factors to the circumstances presented here.  See, e.g., Ressler, 692 \nF.2d at 1216-22 (evaluating the sufficiency ofprocedural safeguards); Geneva \nTowers, 504 F.2d at 491-93 (same).  We note that the district court's conclusion \nthat there is \"no reason to look beyond the regulatory language\" to determine if \nHACLA's notice was sufficient is at odds with Mathews.  Technical compliance \nwith regulatory procedures does not automatically satisfy due process \nrequirements.  See Cleveland Bd. ofEduc. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532,541 (1985) \n(\"'Property' cannot be defined by the procedures provided for its deprivation.\"). \n4 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 132   Filed 05/23/11   Page 6 of 7   Page ID #:876\nMoreover, given that the district court recognized that \"the consequences of a \nsudden reduction in benefits to a Section 8 participant could be potentially \ndevastating,\" there exists a genuine issue of material fact as to whether HAC LA's \nnotice sufficiently protected plaintiffs' property interest.1 \n2.  For similar reasons, the district court improperly granted summary \njudgment on plaintiffs' state due process claim.  California courts have held that \nthe due process provision of the California Constitution, Cal. Const. art I, § 7, is \n\"identical in scope and purpose\" to the Due Process Clause of the federal \nConstitution.  Gray v.  Whitmore, 17 Cal. App. 3d 1, 20 (1971) (citing Gray v. Hall, \n203 Cal. 306, 318 (1928)). \n3.  The district court incorrectly concluded that the notice provided by \ndefendants satisfied the mandatory duty in§ 982.505 to provide one-year notice \nbefore implementing the reduced VPS.  California Government Code§ 815.6 \npermits private individuals to sue public entities where: ( 1) an enactment imposes a \nmandatory duty; (2) it is intended to protect the individual from the type of injury \nsuffered; and (3) the breach of the mandatory duty was the proximate cause of the \n1  The district court's reliance on Atkins v. Parker, 472 U.S. 115 (1985), is \nmisplaced.  There, the plaintiffs had no property interest in advance notice of \ncongressional action under the Food Stamp Act, and thus minimal, after-the-fact \nnotice of a legislative change satisfied due process.  !d. at 125-26, 129-30. \n5 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 132   Filed 05/23/11   Page 7 of 7   Page ID #:877\ninjury suffered.  Cal. Gov't Code§ 815.6.  At a minimum, the notice must be \nsufficiently effective to protect housing benefits recipients from an abrupt and \nunexpected reduction of benefits.  It is a question of fact whether the \"literal \ncompliance\" that occurred here was sufficient to meet§ 815.6's requirements. \n4.  The district court's dismissal of plaintiffs' state law negligence claim was \nerroneous because, while public entities cannot be held liable for their own \nnegligence, they may be held vicariously liable for the negligent acts of their \nindividual employees.  See Cal. Gov't Code§ 815.2; Eastburn v. Reg 'l Fire Prot. \nAgency, 31 Cal. 4th 1175, 1179 (2003). \n5.  The district court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs'§ 1983 claim to \nenforce the notice requirement in the regulation.  Under Save Our Valley v. Sound \nTransit, 335 F .3d 932 (9th Cir. 2003), agency regulations cannot create a federal \nright enforceable under § 1983. \nAFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED for \nproceedings consistent with this disposition.  Each party shall bear its own costs. \n6 ",

Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles, Case No. CV 07-0380 \nRuling on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs in this action are two recipients of federal benefits under the \"Section 8 Housing \nVoucher Program\" (henceforth \"S8HVP\") pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o), and a non-profit \nadvocacy organization.  Defendants are the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles \n(henceforth \"HACL  A\") and Rudolf Montiel, the Executive Director of HAC LA.  In their First \nAmended Class Action Complaint (henceforth \"FA  C\"), Plaintiffs alleged five causes of action: \n(1) \"Denial of Due Process of Law (4  2 U.S.C. § 1983)\" for failing to provide adequate notice to \nS8HVP recipients pursuant to 24 C.F.R. § 982.505(c)(3)(ii) before implementing a reduction of \nhousing benefits; (2) \"Violation of Rights created by 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(Private Right of Action \nAvailable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983)\"; (3) \"Violation of Cal. Gov't. Code§ 815.6\"; (4) \"Violation \nof Art. I, § 7 of California Constitution\"; and ( 5) \"Negligence\" pursuant to California \nGovernment Code§ 815.2, Civil Code§ 1714 and Evidence Code§ 669.  On November 26, \n2007, this Court entered an order (henceforth \"11/26/07 Order\") dismissing Plaintiffs' Second \nand Fifth Causes of Action. \nPlaintiffs and Defendants have filed cross-motions for summary judgment as to Plaintiffs' \nFirst Cause of Action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Third Cause of Action under California \nGovernment Code§ 815.6, and the Fourth Cause of Action under Article I, Section 7, ofthe \nCalifornia Constitution.  For the following reasons, summary judgment is GRANTED on each of \nthose causes of action in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiffs. \nII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  The Statutory and Regulatory Scheme \nIn its 11/26/07 Order, this Court described the relevant statutory and regulatory scheme in \ndetail.  That discussion is incorporated herein and a copy of the Order is attached hereto.  To \nbriefly reiterate, the Section 8 housing program was created to help low income families obtain \nhousing by subsidizing private landlords who would rent to low-income tenants.  See Cisneros v. \nAlpine Ridge Group, 508 U.S. 10, 12 (1993).  One ofthe Section 8 programs is the S8HVP.  42 \nU.S.C. § 1437f(o); 24 C.F.R. § 982.1(a)(l).  The S8HVP is usually administered by a state or \nlocal governmental entity called a \"public housing agency\" or '\"PHA\" within a designated \ngeographic area.  See 24 C.F.R. § 982.1(a)(1).  The United States Department ofHousing and \nUrban Development (\"HUD\") provides housing assistance funds to the PHAs and also supplies \nmoney for the PHAs' administration of the programs. Jd. \nHUD publishes the fair market rents (henceforth \"FMR\") for designated geographic areas \nin the United States.  24 C.F.R. §§ 888.111 and 982.503(a).  A PHA must adopt a payment \nschedule that establishes \"voucher payment standard amounts\" (henceforth \"VPSA\") for each \nFMR area within its jurisdiction.  See 24 C.F.R. § 982.503(a).  The PHA may establish the \npayment standard amount for a unit size at any level between 90 percent and 110 percent of the \n-1-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-GW-FFM   Document 90   Filed 03/08/09   Page 3 of 25   Page ID #:554\npublished FMR for that unit size without HUD approval.  42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(l)(B); see also \n24 C.F.R. § 982.503(b)(l).  It may also establish a separate payment standard amount within the \nbasic range for a designated part of an FMR area.  24 C.F.R. § 982.503(b)(l)(ii).  HUD approval \nis not required for HACLA to reduce the VPSA within the prescribed basic range.  42 U.S.C. § \n1437f(o)(l)(B); see also 24 C.F.R. § 982.503(b)(l). \nAs conceded by the Plaintiffs in their F AC, \"PHAs have discretion to raise or lower the \nVPS[ A] within a statutorily prescribed range.\"  See F AC at~ 26.  If a PHA decreases the \namounts on the payment standard schedule, \"the lower payment standard amount generally must \nbe used to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment for the family beginning at the \neffective date of the family's second regular reexamination following the effective date of the \ndecrease in the payment standard amount.\"  24 C.F.R. § 982.505(c)(3).  Under the regulations \npromulgated by HUD, the PHA is required to advise the S8HVP participants that the application \nof the lower payment standard will be so deferred.  See C.F.R. § 982.505(c)(3)(ii).  24 C.F.R. § \n982.5 requires that such notice be in writing. \nB.  HACLA's Reduction of the VPSA \nAs eventually memorialized in a \"Memorandum of Understanding\" entered into between \nHUD and HACLA in April2004, HUD required HACLA to address the latter's \"significant \nprojected deficits\" in its S8HVP program and to bring its spending on Housing Assistance \nPayments (\"HAP\") into line with the HUD budget at the time.  See Plaintiffs' Separate Statement \nof Genuine Issues of Material Facts in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment \n(\"PSSGI\") at~ 10.  HAC LA elected to use its discretionary authority to take certain actions to \nreduce HAP expenditures, including lowering the VSP A within the prescribed basic range \nallowed by the statute and the HUD regulation.  Id. at~ 11.  On March 26, 2004, HACLA's \nBoard of Commissioners (\"Board\") voted to reduce the VPSA from 110% to 100% ofthe FMR. \nId. at~ 12.  On August 25, 2004, a public hearing, with public comments, was held on HACLA's \n\"Year 2005 Agency Plan\" where the Board emphasized that the 2004 VPSA reduction would not \ntake effect until the Spring of2005.  Id. at~ 14.  Prior to the August hearing, copies ofHACLA's \ndraft of its 2005 Agency Plan, which included information relating to the VPSA reduction, were \nmade available at all HACLA offices.  Id. at~ 15.  In addition, HACLA conducted approximately \ntwenty outreach meetings at public housing sites and seven regional Section 8 meetings which \nincluded a slideshow presentation detailing the effects of the 2004 VPSA reduction.  Id . at ~ 16. \nThe written notice of the 2004 VPSA reduction (\"reduction notice\") was sent to each \nHousing Choice Voucher Program participant on or about the date of the participants' annual \nreexamination, a \"full\" year before the 2004 VPSA reduction was to go into effect.  Id. at~ 17. \nThe reduction notice stated that: \nEffective April 2, 2004, the Housing Authority lowered the \npayment standards used to determine your portion of the rent.  We \nwill not apply these lower payment standards until your next \nregular reexamination.  If you move, however, these new lower \npayment standards will apply to your next unit. \nPSSGI ~ 18; Fields Decl., Ex. I.  The reduction notice also contained a chart detailing the new \npayment standard by unit size.  Id. at~ 19; Fields Decl., Ex I.  Plaintiffs received the reduction \n-2-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-GW-FFM   Document 90   Filed 03/08/09   Page 4 of 25   Page ID #:555\nnotice.  Id. at ,-r 21. \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  First Cause Of Action \nIn its 11/26/07 Order, this Court wrote: \nPlaintiffs' SCA [Second Cause of Action] is based on the \nfollowing syllogism: 1) the S8VHP benefits are \"a federally \nsecured right\"; 2) HUD regulations flesh out how HAC LA's \nmonthly payments are to be calculated; 3) by failing to provide the \nrequired notice, HACLA's reduction in S8HVP benefits is \nunlawful and 4) \"HACLA, therefore, violated 42 U.S.C. § \n143 7f( o )(2) by failing to make the required payments under the \n'applicable payment standard'\" which constitutes a violation of 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983.  See FAC at ,-r,-r 68-69. \nDocket No. 63, 7:2-6.  The Court found that this argument failed for a number of reasons.  First, \ninadequate notice is not itself cognizable as a § 1983 claim.  Second, where (as here) the issue \ndoes not concern the procedural fairness of individual eligibility determinations and notice is not \nrequired by the governing statute but only in a concomitant regulation, Defendants' alleged \nfailure to give notice as required by 24 C.F.R. § 982.505(c)(3) could not give rise to a§ 1983 \nclaim, because a regulation cannot create a right where Congress did not.  See Alexander v. \nSandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 291 (2001).  Finally, even if the regulation here somehow could create a \nprivate right of action, HACLA has not violated the notice provision as set out in the regulation. \nDocket No. 63, 9:25-28. \nIn its previous Order, the Court also wrote that, although the statute did not impose any \nobligation with respect to notice, a failure of notice might still give rise to a due process \ncomplaint that could, in turn, give rise to a § 1983 claim.  This, in essence, is the substance of the \nFirst Cause of Action.  Rather than alleging the violation of a specific statutory right to receive \nnotice that is enforceable under § 1983, it alleges that Plaintiffs were deprived of a protected \nproperty interest without due process. \nThe \"minimum\" elements of a claim for procedural due process are \"(I) a liberty or \nproperty interest protected by the Constitution; (2) a deprivation of the interest by the \ngovernment; and (3) lack of process.\"  Kimes v. Stone, 84 F.3d 1121, 1129 (9th Cir. 1996). \nBecause the undisputed evidence establishes that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated the \ndeprivation of a protected interest or a failure of due process, summary judgment as to the First \nCause of Action is GRANTED in favor of Defendants. \n1.  Is There a Protectable Property Interest in Notice Alone? \nAs an initial matter, the Court rejects Defendants' contention that the cases- Blessing v. \nFreestone, 520 U.S. 329 (1997), and Gozanga University v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 285 (2002) \napply to Plaintiffs First Cause of Action.  The First Cause of Action does not, as the Second \nCause of Action purported to do, assert the violation of a right secured by federal statutes.  Nor, \nobviously, is § 1983 limited in its application to the vindication of such rights.  As noted above, \n-3-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-GW-FFM   Document 90   Filed 03/08/09   Page 5 of 25   Page ID #:556\nthe relevant threshold inquiry is whether Plaintiffs can establish a property interest that is \nprotected by the Fourteenth Amendment. \nDefendants argue that, because HACLA had statutory discretion to reduce the VPSA, \n\"the law is clear that there is no property interest for Plaintiffs to assert.\"  To say categorically \nthat Plaintiffs could not have had any property interest in the benefit they were receiving is, at \nbest, an oversimplification.  It is clear, in the abstract at least, that Plaintiffs can have \"a \nconstitutionally protected 'property' interest in Section 8 benefits by virtue of [their] membership \nin a class of individuals whom the Section 8 program was intended to benefit.\"  Ressler v. Pierce, \n692 F.2d 1212, 1215 (9th Cir. 1982); see also Walters v. Nat'l A..ss'n of Radiation Survivors, 473 \nU.S. 305, 320 n.8 (1985) (\"this Court has held that a person receiving ... benefits [under a \nfederal statutory program] has a 'property' interest in their continued receipt.\").  Nevertheless, \nthe argument could be made (and perhaps this is the argument that HACLA is trying to make) \nthat the only protectible claim of entitlement they could have is in the minimum allowable VPSA \nthat the housing authority could permissibly establish without HUD approval- i.e., 90% of the \npublished FMR.  Because the Defendants have not sought to lower the VSP A amount below the \nprescribed basic range and because the Plaintiffs have conceded that the Defendants did not act \nimproperly in deciding to reduce the VPSA amounts from 110% to 100% of the published FMR, \nthe claimed property interest that has been allegedly violated herein is not as to the benefits \nthemselves. \nA statute, rule or regulation may create an entitlement to a government benefit.  See \nBoard of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972) (\"Property interests, of course, are not \ncreated by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing \nrules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law -rules or \nunderstandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those \nbenefits.\"); see also Allen v. Beverly Hills, 911 F.2d 367, 370 (9th Cir. 1990) (looking to \n\"California state law or City rules and regulations\" to decide whether plaintiff had a property \ninterest in continued employment).  In Allen, the appellate court wrote: \nWhether an expectation of entitlement is sufficient to create a \nproperty interest \"will depend largely upon the extent to which the \nstatute contains mandatory language that restricts the discretion of \nthe [decisionmaker].\" Jacobson v. Hannifin, 627 F.2d 177, 180 (9th \nCir. 1980) (Jacobson).  If \"the decision to confer a benefit is \nunconstrained by 'particularized standards or criteria,' no \nentitlement exists.\"  Fidelity Financial Corp. v. Federal Home Loan \nBank, 792 F.2d 1432, 1436 (9th Cir. 1986) (Fidelity), cert. denied, \n479 U.S. 1064,93 L. Ed. 2d 998, 107 S. Ct. 949 (1987), quoting \nOlim v. Wakinekona, 461 U.S. 238, 249, 75 L. Ed. 2d 813, 103 S. \nCt. 1741 (1983); see also Loehr v. Ventura County Community \nCollege District, 743 F.2d 1310, 1315 (9th Cir. 1984);  Association \nof Orange County Deputy Sheriffs v. Gates, 716 F.2d 733, 734 (9th \nCir. 1983) (Orange County Deputy Sheriffs), cert. denied, 466 U.S. \n937, 104 S. Ct. 1909, 80 L. Ed. 2d 458 (1984); City of Santa Clara \nv. Andrus, 572 F.2d 660, 676 (9th Cir.) (\"[AJ statute will create an \n-4-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-GW-FFM   Document 90   Filed 03/08/09   Page 6 of 25   Page ID #:557\nentitlement to a governmental benefit either if the statute sets out \nconditions under which the benefit must be granted or if the statute \nsets out the only conditions under which the benefit may be \ndenied.\") (quotation omitted, emphasis in original), cert. denied, \n439 U.S. 859, 99 S. Ct. 176, 58 L. Ed. 2d 167 (1978). \n911 F.2d at 370.  Here, the relevant statute places no restriction on the PHA's discretion to raise \nor lower the VPSA within the prescribed basic range.  Thus, arguably, HACLA's lowering the \nVPSA from 110% to 100% ofthe FMR did not effect a cognizable \"property interest.\"  However, \nbecause 24 C.P.R. § 982.505(c)(3) provides for a three-step procedure that must be followed \nwhen a decrease in payment amounts occurs during a HAP contract term, there might be some \nargument for the view that there could be a property interest in the \"current\" VPSA.  But see \nAtkins v. Parker, 472 U.S. 115, 129-30 (1985).  On the other hand, the regulation does not so \nmuch set out the conditions under which the benefit may be lowered as the procedure that must \nbe followed after the benefit is lowered.  Even assuming that the regulation is sufficient to create \na property interest as described, that property interest would be contingent upon Plaintiffs not \nhaving received the regulatory notice.  Plaintiffs' papers never adequately explain why the due \nprocess clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and not the regulation itself, should be \ndeterminative of the nature and sufficiency of the notice required. \nPlaintiffs' characterization of the potential interest at stake is often confusing.  For \nexample, Plaintiffs write: \"Section 8 tenants have a property interest in this regulation (including \nin receiving timely notice of a change in the VPS[A  ] standard that effectively reduces their \nbenefit and increases their rent) either on its O\\VTI or in combination with their section 8 tenancy \nand/or California law allowing them to enforce federal regulations enacted for their benefit.\" \nPlaintiffs' Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (\"DMSJ Opp.\") 1:25-2:5. \nIt is safe to say that no one can have a property interest in a regulation or a property interest \"in \nreceiving timely notice,\" because there can only be a property interest in property.1 \nThe regulatory notice requirement is arguably the only \"restriction\" (if that is the \nappropriate word) on HACLA's ability to reduce the VPSA within HUD limits.  If the notice \nprocedures set forth in 24 C.F.R. § 982.505(c)(3) were followed, it would obviate any property \ninterest Plaintiffs might have claimed in continuing to receive the benefit they were receiving \nprior to the reduction.  It does not aid our analysis in any way to think of this fact - as Plaintiffs \nwould have us do- as creating a property interest in receiving notice.  Nor is it useful to collapse \nthe analysis of whether there is a protected interest into the analysis of whether there was due \nprocess.  They are two separate inquiries.  Plaintiffs' efforts to characterize their interest in \nreceiving adequate notice as a property interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment are \nunderstandable, because it is easy to see that the consequences of a sudden reduction in benefits \n1 At page 2 of their opposition, Plaintiffs write, \"As we shall discuss, Defendants fail to \nrecognize that the right to notice of a change in benefits is part of the property interest here, and so the \nfact that HACLA could change the benefit does not eviscerate the property interest in the benefit.\" \nHowever, Plaintiffs never fulfill their promise by articulating exactly how a person can have a \"property \ninterest\" in receiving notice of a change in benefits which is separate and legally cognizable from the \nunderlying benefit/property itself. \n-5-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-GW-FFM   Document 90   Filed 03/08/09   Page 7 of 25   Page ID #:558\nto a Section 8 participant could be potentially devastating.  However, Plaintiffs simply have not \npresented a coherent theory for stating such a § 1983 claim in the present context. \n2.  The First Cause of Action Is Untenable in Light of the Holding in Atkins. \nPlaintiffs' due process cause of action based upon purported insufficiency of notice is \ncontrary to the holding ofthe Supreme Court in Atkins v. Parker, 472 U.S. 115 (1985).  In \nAtkins, Congress had amended the Food Stamp Act to reduce the earned-income \"disregard\" \nused in computing eligibility from 20 percent to 18 percent.  Thereafter, the Massachusetts \nDepartment of Public Welfare mailed a notice to all food-stamp recipients with earned income in \nthe state notifying them that: 1) the reduction might result in a lowering or termination of their \nbenefits; 2) they had a right to request a hearing; and 3) their benefits would be reinstated if a \nhearing was requested within ten days of the notice.  A class action was brought claiming that the \nnotice was inadequate.  The lower courts agreed and found that the initial and subsequent notices \nviolated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The statute itself did not \nmandate any notice at all but merely provided that a household \"which timely requests ... a fair \nhearing after receiving individual notice of agency action reducing or terminating its benefits\" \nwould continue to receive the same level of benefits until the hearing is completed.  Id. at 123-\n24. \nIn reversing the lower courts' rulings, the Court initially observed that: \nFood-stamp benefits, like the welfare benefits at issue in \nGoldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970), \"are a matter of statutory \nentitlement for persons qualified to receive them.\"  !d., at 262 \n(footnote omitted).  Such entitlements are appropriately treated as a \nform of \"property\" protected by the Due Process Clause; \naccordingly, the procedures that are employed in determining \nwhether an individual may continue to participate in the statutory \nprogram must comply with the commands of the Constitution. \nI d. at 128.  The Court went on to hold that: \nThis case, however, does not concern the procedural \nfairness of individual eligibility determinations.  Rather, it involves \na legislatively mandated substantive change in the scope of the \nentire program.  Such a change must, of course, comply with the \nsubstantive limitations on the power of Congress, but there is no \nsuggestion in this case that the amendment at issue violated any \nsuch constraint.  *  *  *  * The procedural component of the \nDue Process Clause does not \"impose a constitutional limitation on \nthe power of Congress to make substantive changes in the law of \nentitlement to public benefits.\"  Richardson v. Belcher,  404 U.S. \n78, 81 (1971). \nThe congressional decision to lower the earned-income \ndeduction from 20 percent to 18 percent gave many food-stamp \nhouseholds a less valuable entitlement in 1982 than they had \nreceived in 1981.  But the 1981 entitlement did not include any \n-6-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-GW-FFM   Document 90   Filed 03/08/09   Page 8 of 25   Page ID #:559\nright to have the program continue indefinitely at the same level, or \nto phrase it another way, did not include any right to the \nmaintenance of the same level of property entitlement.  Before the \nstatutory change became effective, the existing property \nentitlement did not qualify the legislature's power to substitute a \ndifferent, less valuable entitlement at a later date. As we have \nfrequently noted: \"[A] welfare recipient is not deprived of due \nprocess when the legislature adjusts benefit levels .... [T]he \nlegislative determination provides all the process that is due.\" \nThe participants in the food-stamp program had no greater \nright to advance notice of the legislative change - in this case, the \ndecision to change the earned-income disregard level -than did any \nother voters. \n*  *  *  * \nThe claim that petitioners had a constitutional right to better \nnotice of the consequences of the statutory amendment is without \nmerit. All citizens are presumptively charged with knowledge of \nthe law, see, e.g., North Laramie Land Co. v. Hoffman, 268 U.S. \n276, 283 (1925).  Arguably that presumption may be overcome in \ncases in which the statute does not allow a sufficient \"grace \nperiod\" to provide the persons affected by a change in the law with \nan adequate opportunity to become familiar with their obligations \nunder it.  See Texaco, Inc. v. Short, 454 U.S. 516, 532 (1982).  In \nthis case, however, not only was there a grace period of over 90 \ndays before the amendment became effective, but in addition, \nevery person affected by the change was given individual notice of \nthe substance of the amendment. \nAs a matter of constitutional law there can be no doubt \nconcerning the sufficiency of the notice describing the effect of the \namendment in general terms. Surely Congress can presume that \nsuch a notice relative to a matter as important as a change in a \nhousehold's food-stamp allotment would prompt an appropriate \ninquiry if it is not fully understood.  The entire structure of our \ndemocratic government rests on the premise that the individual \ncitizen is capable of informing himself about the particular policies \nthat affect his destiny. To contend that this notice was \nconstitutionally insufficient is to reject that premise. \nId. 128-31 (footnotes omitted). \nThis case is similar to Atkins in that: 1) it does not concern individual eligibility \ndeterminations as to welfare benefits; 2) it involves a substantive change in a rate that is utilized \nto calculate the amount of benefits for persons within a federal program administered by the \nstates; 3) that change results in the participating households' receiving a \"less valuable \nentitlement\" than prior to the change; 4) there is no challenge that the change itself is beyond the \n-7-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-GW-FFM   Document 90   Filed 03/08/09   Page 9 of 25   Page ID #:560\nauthority of the enacting government body nor to the manner in which it was promulgated; 5) \nthere is no challenge to the change itself but simply as to notice given; and 6) the operative \nfederal statutes do not require any specific notice to be given to pruticipants prior to the change \nbecoming effective.  In light of Atkins, Plaintiffs' fundamental claim in their First Cause of \nAction in the FAC that they have a \"constitutional right to better notice ofthe consequence ofthe \n. . . amendment [here, the change in the VPSA within the prescribed basic range] is without \nmerit.\"  Id. at 130. \n3.  The HACLA Complied with the Requirements 24 C.F.R. § 982.505(c)(3)(ii). \nOnce again, Plaintiffs frame the issue of Defendants' compliance with the regulatory \nnotice requirement confusingly: \nIn its order on the Motion to Dismiss, this Court suggested that \nHAC LA had complied (in a literal sense) with the HUD regulation. \nHowever, since that motion did not challenge Plaintiffs due \nprocess claims, the issue was not before the Court ofwhether \nliteral compliance with a regulation is lawful compliance if \napplicable due process standards were not met in implementing the \nregulation. \nPlaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment (\"PMSJ\") 14:16-20.  Plaintiffs have never established \nwhy the Court would look beyond the regulations to decide the procedural minimum for \ncompliance when the \"case ... does not concern the procedural fairness of individual eligibility \ndeterminations.\"2  Atkins, 472 U.S. at 129.  Either the regulatory requirements were satisfied or \nthey were not - and the Court, in its previous Order, found that they were.  It could not have \nmade this finding if the notice Defendants sent did not communicate the information that the \nHUD regulation requires that it convey. \nPlaintiffs argue that \"where a regulation establishes a right to notice, and the notice did \nnot comport with due process, the regulation was not lawfully implemented.\" But, here Plaintiffs \nconfuse their own First and Second Causes of Action.  The Court has already determined that the \nregulation did not create a \"right to notice.\"  Moreover, inadequate notice by itself does not give \nrise to a § 1983 claim.  While a failure of notice might, for the reasons described above, effect a \nproperty interest such that due process concerns would be implicated, there is- again- no reason \nto look beyond the regulatory language for the notice requirements.  The assertion that \"the \n2 Although Plaintiffs cite Geneva Towers Tenants Organization v. Federated Mortgage Investors, \n504 F.2d 483,489 n.13 (9th Cir. 1974)  for the proposition that \"once a substantive right has been created, \nit is the Due Process Clause which provides the procedural minimums, and not a statute or regulation,\" \nthey have not established the existence of such a substantive right.  The cited text in Geneva Towers \nrefers to the plurality opinion in Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134 (1974), in which a majority of the \njustices rejected Justice Rehnquist's \"bitter with the sweet\" approach to property interests conferred by \nstatute.  This majority view has prevailed.  See, u,_, Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 432 \n(1982) (\"While the legislature may elect not to confer a property interest ... it may not constitutionally \nauthorize the deprivation of such an interest, once conferred, without appropriate procedural \nsafeguards.\").  The corollary of this view is not, however, that anytime there is a statutory or regulatory \nprocedure, it automatically invokes the full range of due process protection. \n-8-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-GW-FFM   Document 90   Filed 03/08/09   Page 10 of 25   Page ID #:561\nnotice did not comport with due process\" here is essentially meaningless. \nEven assuming that a failure of regulatory notice could here give rise to a § 1983 claim, \nPlaintiffs have not proffered any evidence which raises a dispute as to a material fact which \nwould demonstrate any failure on Defendants' part to provide the notice required under the \napplicable regulation.  It is not disputed by the Plaintiffs that: \nThe reduction notice that was sent to each participant stated \nthat, \"Effective April 2, 2004, the Housing Authority lowered the \npayment standards used to determine your portion of the rent. We \nwill not apply these lower payment standards until your next regular \nreexamination. If you move, however, these new lower payment \nstandards will apply to your next unit.\"  [See PSSGI at, 18.] \n*  *  *  * \nThe reduction notice also contained a chart that detailed the \nnew payment standard amount by bedroom size.  [See PSSGI at, \n19.] \n*  *  *  * \nThe reduction notice also included a form titled HAPP RE-\n3 8 (\"RE-3 8\") which showed the amount of rent each participant \nwould be required to pay the landlord/owner and the amount that \nHACLA would pay the landlord/owner on the participant's behalf \nfor that year.  [See PSSGI at, 22.] \n*  *  *  * \nApproximately four weeks prior to the 2004 VPS reduction \ngoing into effect, each participant received a second RE-38 which \ndetailed the actual amount of rent each participant would be \nrequired to pay for that year.  [See PSSGI at, 24.] \nThe declaration of Plaintiffs' expert (Dr. Finegan), which is employed in an attempt to \ncreate a material issue of fact, is premised upon the incorrect assumption that the requirement of \n24 C.F.R. § 982.505(c  )(3)(ii) is to give tenants notice of an increase in rent rather than informing \nthem that \"the application of the lower payment standard will be deferred until the second regular \nreexamination ....\"   Compare Finegan Decl. Page 2, lines 20-23 and page 4, line 4-6 with 24 \nC.F.R. § 982.505(c)(3)(ii).  There is no basis for reading Finegan's requirements or \nmisunderstandings into the regulation.  Similarly, Plaintiffs' argument that the notice flyer was \ndefective because it \"did not explain the reasons or legal justification for the action\" finds no \nsupport in the regulation.  Moreover, the Finegan Declaration assumes that Section 8 participants \nare not familiar with the term \"Voucher Payment Standard\" and the payment standard chart, \nwhereas Defendants have submitted unrebutted evidence to the contrary.  See Agbor Decl. ,, 4-\n8; Baldwin Decl., 12.  Finally, to paraphrase Atkins, 472 U.S. at 131: \nAs a matter of constitutional law there can be no doubt \nconcerning the sufficiency of the notice describing the effect of the \namendment in general tetms. Surely [the HACLA] can presume \nthat such a notice relative to a matter as important as [the effective \ndate of] a change in a household's [VPSA] allotment would \n-9-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-GW-FFM   Document 90   Filed 03/08/09   Page 11 of 25   Page ID #:562\nprompt an appropriate inquiry if it is not fully understood.  The \nentire structure of our democratic government rests on the premise \nthat the individual citizen is capable of informing himself about the \nparticular policies that affect his destiny. To contend that this \nnotice was constitutionally insufficient is to reject that premise. \nIn light of the above discussion, the Court need not consider Defendants' argument that a \n\"lesser\" due process standard exists for \"across-the-board\" reductions in benefits.  See DMSJ § \nIV(3)(a).  Similarly, Defendants' evidence regarding additional \"outreach\" efforts to Section 8 \nrecipients is immaterial to resolving this claim.  Finally, because there is no fact in dispute \nwhether Plaintiffs have a cognizable § 1983 claim, the Court need not reach Defendants' \nchallenge -in the context of their opposition to Plaintiffs' summary judgment motion - to \nPlaintiffs' ability to act as class representatives. 3 \nB.  Third Cause Of Action \nPlaintiffs' Third Cause of Action, for violation of Cal. Govt. Code§ 815.6, is also \npremised upon a purported failure of due process.  Section 815.6 provides: \nWhere a public entity is under a mandatory duty imposed by an \nenactment that is designed to protect against the risk of a particular \nkind of injury, the public entity is liable for an injury of that kind \nproximately caused by its failure to discharge the duty unless the \npublic entity establishes that it exercised reasonable diligence to \ndischarge the duty. \nPlaintiff relies upon the Due Process Clause to create the \"mandatory duty\" that Defendants \nallegedly breached.  Plaintiffs also appear to contend that § 815.6 could have independently \ncreated a protected property interest in the HUD regulation.  Again, however, this contention is \nnever cashed out.  Accepting Plaintiff's argument that§ 815.6 creates a statutory right to enforce \nfederal and state regulations, there is still no basis for concluding that Defendants' literal \ncompliance with the regulation was an abrogation of their duty.  Plaintiffs' argument that§ 815.6 \nitself implicates a somehow more robust due process standard is a non-sequitor.  Citing Wolffv. \nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974), they write that because due process standards apply to insure \nstate created rights are not arbitrarily abrogated, HUD \"had to comply with due process\" in \nproviding notice under the HUD regulations.  This is simply another iteration of the argument \nwhich the Court has already rejected in its earlier ruling on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. \n3 With regard to this latter contention, Defendants are correct that the admissions ofNozzi and \nPalaez that they do not recall reading the notification flyer until right around the time the VPSA went up \ndo indeed indicate that they could not have suffered the harm allegedly suffered by the rest of the class -\ni.e., confusion by the notice a year before.  Plaintiffs' argument from Nelson v. City ofN.Y., 352 U.S. \n103 (1956), where the court found that notice was sufficient to satisfY due process even though plaintiffs \nnever read the notice, suffers from a logical fallacy.  Plaintiffs have not shown why common law \ncausation principles should not apply here. \n-10-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-GW-FFM   Document 90   Filed 03/08/09   Page 12 of 25   Page ID #:563\nC.  Fourth Cause Of Action \nPlaintiffs' Fourth Cause of Action alleges a violation of the California Constitution, Art. \n1 § 7.  Defendants argue correctly that this cause of action fails because it is well settled under \nCalifornia law that only those governmental decisions that are adjudicative in nature, and not \nlegislative or quasi-legislative, are subject to procedural due process principles.  See u,. \nMcKinney v. Board of Trustees, 31 Cal.3d 79, 98-99 (1982).  Plaintiffs respond that the cases \ncited by Defendants for this proposition involve challenges to the decision itself or challenges to \nthe decision making process, whereas \"Plaintiffs are challenging the notice from the perspective \nof tenants being able to plan for their rent increase, which was the purpose for the regulation's \none-year notice requirement.\"  Opp. 14:27-15:1.  The provision of the California Constitution \nwhich provides that no person shall be deprived of property without due process of law, \"has \nbeen held to be identical in scope and purpose with the due process clause of the federal \nConstitution.\"  Russell v. Carleson, 36 Cal.App.3d 334, 342 (1973).  Plaintiffs do not contend \nthat their claim under the California Constitution would still be viable even if their federal due \nprocess claim were not.  Accordingly, summary judgment is granted as to this claim. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above and in the 11126/07 Order, summary judgment is granted in \nfavor of the Defendants and against the Plaintiffs as to the First, Third and Fourth Causes of \nAction in the F AC. \nV.  RULINGS ON EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS \nA.  Plaintiffs' Objections; Motion to Strike Declarations in Support of Defendants' \nOpposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment \n1.  Declaration of Megumi Takarabe \na)  Request to strike entire declaration is denied. \nb)  Objections to paragraph 3 sustained on the basis of Federal Rules of Evidence \n408 as to the second sentence only.  Otherwise, objections overruled. \nc)  Objections to paragraph 4 sustained as to the word \"always\" in the first \nsentence.  Otherwise, objections overruled.  The Court treats paragraph 4 \nas a description ofHACLA's position on the subject delineated therein \nand not as a statement of applicable law. \nd)  Objections to paragraph 5 sustained on the basis of relevance. \n2.  Declaration of Kenneth Baldwin \na)  Objections to paragraph 11 sustained in part because vast portions of it consist \nof arguments and/ or characterization/interpretation of regulations which \nare improper in a declaration. \nb)  Objections to paragraphs 12 and 13 sustained in part because vast portions of \nthose paragraphs consist of arguments and/or characterization or \n-11-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-GW-FFM   Document 90   Filed 03/08/09   Page 13 of 25   Page ID #:564\ninterpretation of regulations which are improper in a declaration. \n3.

Plaintiffs' Objections to the Declaration of Shirley Fields \nPlaintiffs' objections to the Declaration of Shirley Fields is unclear in that most of \nit appears to be in the form of substantive arguments rather than proper \nevidentiary objections.  Moreover, it seems that the Plaintiffs are only objecting to \nthe contents of paragraph 20 in the declaration.  Plaintiffs' objections are denied \nexcept that: 1) as to the last three sentences in paragraph 20, it is unclear as to \nwhat documents are being referenced therein and whether those documents are \nincluded in the Defendants' Appendix of Exhibits; and 2) copies ofthose \ndocuments should have been provided and would \"speak for themselves.\" \nC.  Defendants' Objections and Motion to Strike the Declarations Filed in Support of \nPlaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment \n1.  Declaration of Edward Finegan \nWhile the Court agrees that Dr. Finegan's declaration contains a multitude of \nincorrect assumptions, unsupported factual assertions, and misstatements as to \napplicable law, it will not strike the entire declaration.  Had Defendants specified \nparticular portions of the declaration to strike, this Court would have been more \nreceptive to that approach. \n2.

INTRODUCTION \n17 \nPlaintiffs in this action are two recipients of federal benefits under the \"Section 8 Housing Voucher \n18 \nProgram\" (henceforth \"S8HVP\") pursuant to 42 U.S. C. § 143 7f( o) and a non-profit advocacy organization. \n19 \nDefendants are the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (henceforth \"HACLA\") and Rudolf \n20 \nMontiel, the Executive Director of HAC LA. \n21 \nIn their First Amended Class Action Complaint (henceforth \"F AC\"), Plaintiffs allege that: \n22 \n2.  In or around July of2005, the Housing Authority of the City \n23  of Los Angeles (\"HACLA\"), which administers the Section 8 Program \nlocally,  began implementing a large-scale rollback of housing benefits \n24  provided to Section 8 recipients in its jurisdiction. [ * * * *]. \n25  3.  Before  doing  so,  however,  HACLA  was  required  by \napplicable federal regulations, independently enforceable as well through \n26  state law, to provide adequate notice at least one year prior to the cut in the \n* * \nlevel of services. [  * *]. \n27 \n4.  HACLA did not make any meaningful attempt to comply \n28  with this notice requirement.  Rather than separately providing a formal \nadministrative notice informing Section 8 recipients that they would be \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-GW-FFM   Document 90   Filed 03/08/09   Page 15 of 25   Page ID #:566\nresponsible for a specific increase in rent, HAC LA inserted into a large stack \n1  of materials sent to each recipient a nondescript and technically worded flyer \nthat failed to  convey any useful  information relating to  the change in \n2  benefits. \n3  See FAC at rs 2, 3 and 4.  Plaintiffs raise five causes of action: 1) \"Denial ofDue Process ofLaw (42 \n4  U.S.C. § 1983)\" for failing to provide notice to S8HVP recipients pursuantto 24 C.F.R. § 982.505(c)(3)(ii) \n5  before implementing the rollback of housing benefits which are a protected property interest under 42 \n6  U.S.C. § 1437f(o) ; 2) \"ViolationofRights Created by 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(Private Right ofA  ction Available \n7  under 42 U.S.C. § 1983)\"; 3) \"Violation of Cal. Gov't. Code § 815.6\"; 4) \"Violation of Art. I, § 7 of \n8  California Constitution\"; and 5) \"Negligence\" pursuant to California Government Code§ 815.2, Civil Code \n9  § 1714 and Evidence Code § 669. 1 Defendants now move to dismiss the second and fifth causes of action. \n10  II.  BACKGROUND \n11  A.  The S8HVP \n12  As noted in Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Group, 508 U.S. 10, 12 (1993): \n13  In 1974, Congress amended the United States Housing Act of 1937 \n(Housing Act) to create what is known as the Section 8 housing program. \n14  Through the Section 8 program, Congress hoped to  \"ai[d ]  low-income \nfamilies in obtaining a decent place to live,\" 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(a)(1988 ed., \n15  Supp. III), by subsidizing private landlords who would rent to low-income \ntenants.  Under the program, tenants make rental payments based on their \n16  income  and  ability  to  pay;  the  Department  of Housing  and  Urban \nDevelopment (HUD) then makes  \"assistance payments\" to  the private \n17  landlords in an amount calculated to make up the difference between the \ntenant's contribution and a \"contract rent\" agreed upon by the landlord and \n18  HUD. \n19  One ofthe Section 8 programs is the S8HVP.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o); 24 C.F.R. § 982.l(a)(l). \n20  The S8HVP is usually administered by a state or local governmental entity called a \"public housing agency\" \n21  or \"PHA\" within a designated geographic area.  See 24 C.F.R. § 982.1(a)(l).  HUD provides housing \n22  assistance funds to the PHAs and also supplies monies for the PHAs' administration of the programs.  Id . \n23 \n24 \nPlaintiffs' original Complaint contained two additional causes of action for \"Violation of Cal. Civ. Code § 52.1\" (which \nthis Court dismissed without leave to amend) and \"Taxpayers' ... Suit for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief under Cal. Code of \n25  Civil Procedure§ 526a\" (which Plaintiffs voluntarily withdrew). Also, this Court granted Defendants' initial Motion to Dismiss \nas to the second cause of action, but with leave to amend, because it found that count to be unclear as to the basis of the claim since \n26  it appeared to be entirely duplicative of the first cause of action.  Further, at the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss, the Court also \nheard Defendants' Motion to Strike Causes of Action Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 425.16.  In their papers \n27  and at the oral argument, Plaintiffs conceded that their lawsuit did not challenge the decision to lower the S8HVP benefits but \nrather the Defendants' failure to give adequate notice to recipients prior to the effectuating the change.  See~, Reporter's \n28 \nTranscript of April30, 2007 hearing at page 12. \n2 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-GW-FFM   Document 90   Filed 03/08/09   Page 16 of 25   Page ID #:567\nHUD publishes the fair market rents (henceforth \"FMR\")2 for designated geographic areas in the \n1 \n2  United States.  See 24 C.P.R.§§ 888.111 and 982.503(a). A public housing agency must adopt a payment \nschedule that establishes \"voucher payment standard amounts\" (henceforth sometimes \"VPSA\") for each \n3 \nPMR area within its jurisdiction. See 24 C.P.R.§ 982.503(a). As to each PMR area, the PHA must set the \n4 \nVPSA for each \"unit size\" where unit size is measured by the number of bedrooms (i.e., zero-bedroom or \n5 \nstudio, one-bedroom and so on).  Id.  The public housing agency is initially limited as to its choice of the \n6 \nvoucher payment standard amount.  As stated in 24 C.P.R. § 982.503(b)(l): \n7 \n(i) The PHA may establish the payment standard amount for a unit \n8 \nsize at any level between 90 percent and 110 percent of the published PMR \nfor that unit size.  HUD approval is not required to establish a payment \n9 \nstandard amount in that range (\"basic range\"). \n(ii) The PHA may establish a separate payment standard amount \n10 \nwithin the basic range for a designated part of an PMR area. \n11 \nSee also 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(l)(B). \n12 \nThe voucher payment standard amount is used to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment \n13 \nfora family. See 24 C.P.R.§ 982.505(a). Where the PHAhas established a VPSA within the \"basic range\" \n14 \nand where the rent for a family (including utilities except for telephone) for their particular unit falls within \n15 \nthat range, the amount of monthly assistance payment for that family will normally be: \n16 \n... the amount by which the rent (including the amount allowed for tenant-\npaid utilities) exceeds the greatest of the following amounts, rounded to the \n17 \nnearest dollar: \n(i) 30 percent of the monthly adjusted income ofthe family. \n18 \n(ii) 10 percent ofthe monthly income ofthe family. \n19 \n42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(2)(A);3 see also 24 C.P.R. § 982.505(a). \n20 \nPersons seeking S8HVP assistance must apply to the PHA and supply income and other information \n21 \nto establish their eligibility to participate in the program.  See 42 U.S.C.  § 1437f(o)(4); 24 C.P.R.  § \n22 \n982.201(a) and (b).  Once in the program, the PHA must conduct, at a minimum, a yearly review of the \n23 \nfamily income and other information of the S8HVP participants.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(5); 24 C.P.R. \n24 \n§ 982.516(a). \n25 \n26  \"Fair market rent means the rent, including the cost of utilities (except telephone), as established by HUD ... for units \nof varying sizes (by number of bedrooms), that must be paid in the market area to rent privately owned, existing, decent, safe and \n27  sanitary rental housing of modest (non-luxury) nature with suitable amenities.\"  24 C.F.R. § 888.1ll(b). \n28  \"Adjusted income\" is defined in 42 U.S.C. § 1437a(b)(5). \n3 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-GW-FFM   Document 90   Filed 03/08/09   Page 17 of 25   Page ID #:568\nAs conceded by the Plaintiffs in their FAC, \"PHAs have discretion to raise or lower the VPS[A] \n1 \n2  within a statutorily prescribed range.\" See F AC at~ 26. Under regulations promulgated by HUD, if a PHA \ndecreases the amounts on the payment standard schedule, \"the lower payment standard amount generally \n3 \nmust be used to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment for the family beginning at the effective \n4 \ndate of the family's second regular reexamination following the effective date of the decrease in the \n5 \npayment standard amount.\"  24 C.F.R. § 982.505(c)(3).  There is a three step process. \n6 \nDecrease  in  the  payment standard amount during  the  HAP  [housing \n7 \nassistance payments] contract term.  If the amount on the payment standard \nschedule is  decreased during the term of the HAP contract, the lower \n8 \npayment standard amount generally must be used to calculate the monthly \nhousing assistance payment for the family beginning at the effective date of \n9 \nthe family's second regular reexamination following the effective date oft he \ndecrease in the payment standard amount.  The PHA must determine the \n10 \npayment standard for the family as follows. \n11 \n(i) Step I: At the first regular reexamination following the decrease in the \npayment standard amount, the PHA shall determine the payment standard \n12 \nfor the family[ ...]  (using the decreased payment standard amount). \n13 \n(ii) Step 2 (first reexamination payment standard amount): The PHA shall \ncompare the payment standard amount from step 1 to the payment standard \n14 \namount last used to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment for the \nfamily.  The payment standard amount used by the PHA to calculate the \n15 \nmonthly housing  assistance payment at the first regular reexamination \nfollowing the decrease in the payment standard amount is the higher oft hese \n16 \ntwo payment standard amounts.  The PHA shall advise the family that the \napplication of the lower payment standard amount will be deferred until the \n17 \nsecond regular reexamination following the effective date of the decrease in \nthe payment standard amount. \n18 \n(iii) Step 3 (second reexamination payment standard amount): At the second \n19 \nregular reexamination following  the  decrease  in the  payment standard \namount, the lower payment standard amount shall be used to calculate the \n20 \nmonthly housing assistance payment for the family unless the PHA has \nsubsequently increased the payment standard amount .... \n21 \n22  24 C.F.R. § 982.505(c)(3)(i) thru (iii) [emphasis added]. \nAs stated in 24 C.F.R. § 982.5: \"Where part 982 requires any notice to be given by the PHA, the \n23 \nfamily or the owner, the notice must be in writing.\" \n24 \nB.  Operative Allegations \n25 \nIn regards to the HACLA's purported failure to provide notice to the Plaintiff class, the operative \n26 \nallegations are contained in paragraphs 28 through 31 of the F AC which state: \n27 \n28.  On April2, 2004, HAC LA made a decision to reduce the pre-\n28 \n4 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-GW-FFM   Document 90   Filed 03/08/09   Page 18 of 25   Page ID #:569\nexisting VPS[A]. The impact on Section 8 participants was significant. For \n1 \nexample, the VPS[A] for a 0-bedroom (\"bachelor\") apartment plummeted \nfrom $795 to $674, a reduction of$121 per month. \n2 \n29.  To implement this change in policy, the HACLA stuck a one-\n3 \npage flyer in the materials mailed to each recipient on the date of their \nannual re-examination. Unlike other explanatory notices contained in these \n4 \npackets, the flyer did not require the recipient to acknowledge receipt by \nsigning and returning the form.  The flyer was not on letterhead, did not \n5 \ncontain a phone number for inquiries, and did not give a legal basis for the \ndecision. More importantly, the flyer did not advise recipients that their out \n6 \nof-pocket rent payment would actually be going up, much less specify the \namount of the increase.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that \n7 \nbasis  allege,  that  these  flyers  were  sent  out,  buried  among  other \nreexamination materials, from approximately July 2004 through July 2005. \n8 \n30.  The language of the flyer did not meaningfully communicate \n9 \nto the recipient that there would actually be a reduction in the portion of his \nor her rent that HACLA would pay, and a corresponding increase in the \n10 \nportion of his or her rent that the recipient would be required to pay. \n11 \n31.  The VPS [A] decrease went into effect with re-examinations \nthat took place from July 2005 to July 2006. \n12 \n13  See FAC at ~'s 28 through 31. \nPlaintiffs' first cause of action is a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim of a denial of due process against \n14 \nDefendant HACLA.  They contend that they have \"a property interest in the provisions of [24] C.P.R. § \n15 \n982.505(c)(3)(ii) under both state and federal law ....\"   See FAC at~ 58.  In paragraph 59 ofthe FAC, \n16 \nPlaintiffs assert that: \n17 \nBy failing to provide Plaintiff Class clear or meaningful notice oft he actions \n18 \nHACLA intended to take and its consequences at the time required by 24 \nC.P.R. 982.505(c)(3)(ii), most particularly by failing to meaningfully or \n19 \neffectively advise the Plaintiff Class that their out of pocket share of future \nrents would be increased [ ... ] and by failing to indicate from whom the \n20 \nnotice emanated, the legal basis for the action, a phone number for inquiries, \nor how to protest or appeal the action, Defendant HACLA deprived the \n21 \nPlaintiff Class  of due  process  of law  in violation  of the  Fourteenth \nAmendment, thereby entitling the  Class to  bring the  suit and recover \n22 \ndamages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n23 \nPlaintiffs seek \"injunctive and declaratory relief, an accounting, restitution and/or damages.\" Id. at~ 61. \n24 \nPlaintiffs' second cause of action seeks to establish a claim based upon a purported violation of \n25 \nrights created by 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o) which allegedly can be litigated through a \"private right of action \n26 \navailable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\"  See FAC at page 17.  As stated in paragraphs 68 and 69 of the FAC: \n27 \n68.  In sum, 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(2) and the other sections cited \nabove required HACLA to make monthly payments for the benefit of \n28 \n5 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-GW-FFM   Document 90   Filed 03/08/09   Page 19 of 25   Page ID #:570\nrecipients  according to  the  \"applicable payment  standard.\"  That is  a \n1 \nfederally secured right.  The regulations flush [sic]  out how HACLA's \nmonthly payments are to be calculated by specifying how the applicable \n2 \npayment standard is to be determined.  By failing to provide the required \nnotice, the new payment standard implemented by HACLA was unlawful. \n3 \nHAC  LA, therefore, violated 4 2 U.S. C. § 14 3 7 f( o )(2) by failing to make the \nrequired payments under the \"applicable payment standard.\" \n4 \n69.  Defendants,  as  described  in  this  complaint,  deprived \n5 \nPlaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class of their federal rights, specifically their \nvoucher payment standard rights created by42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o), including \n6 \n§ 1437(o)(2) and§ 1437f(o)(1), under the color of state law, and thereby \nviolated 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n7 \nII.  DISCUSSION \n8 \nA.  Applicable Law \n9 \nDefendants herein seek to dismiss the second and fifth causes of action pursuant to Federal Rules \n10 \nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  As stated in Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dept., 901 F.2d 696,699 (9th Cir. \n11 \n1990). \n12 \nA complaint should not be dismissed under Rule 12(b )( 6) \"unless it appears \n13 \nbeyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his \nclaim which would entitle him to relief.\"  Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, \n14 \n45-46 (1957).  Dismissal can be based on lack of cognizable legal theory or \nthe absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory. \n15 \nRobertson v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 749 F.2d 530, 533-34 (9th Cir. \n1984).  On a motion to dismiss, the court accepts the facts alleged in the \n16 \ncomplaint as true.  Shah, 797 F.2d at 745. \n17 \nB.  Plaintiffs' Second Cause of Action \n18 \nBefore considering the viability of the Plaintiffs' Second Cause of Action (henceforth \"SCA\"), it \n19 \nshould initially be noted that Defendants have not moved to dismiss the First Cause of Action (henceforth \n20 \n\"FCA\") which asserts that HACLA violated 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by denying Plaintiffs due process in failing \n21 \nto give them sufficient notice as required by 24 C.F.R. § 982.505(c)(3)(ii) before reducing S8HVP benefits. \n22 \nLikewise, Plaintiffs have conceded that PHAs (such as HACLA) have the discretion to lower the voucher \n23 \nprogram standard amount (which is used to calculate the S8HVP benefits) within certain limitations. \n24 \nPlaintiffs have not (and apparently do not) contend that HACLA acted substantively or procedurally in an \n25 \nunlawful manner in deciding to reduce the S8HVP benefits, except as to the notice issue.  In light of the \n26 \nabove, Plaintiffs' SCA either: 1) is simply the same claim as the FCA but stated in slightly different words, \n27 \nor 2) fails to state a cognizable legal theory other than a due process claim based on lack of notice and fails \n28 \n6 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-GW-FFM   Document 90   Filed 03/08/09   Page 20 of 25   Page ID #:571\n1  to allege sufficient facts that would establish a cognizable legal theory under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n2  Plaintiffs' SCA is based on the following syllogism: 1) the S8VHP benefits are \"a federally secured \n3  right\"; 2) HUD regulations flesh out how HACLA's monthly payments are to be calculated; 3) by failing \n4  to provide the required notice, HACLA's reduction in S8HVP benefits is unlawful and 4) \"HACLA, \n5  therefore, violated 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o )(2) by failing to make the required payments under the 'applicable \n6  payment standard\"' which constitutes a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  See FAC at rs 68-69.  Plaintiffs' \n7  SCA fails to state a claim for the reasons stated below. \n8  As held in Wright v. City of Roanoke Redevelopment & Housing Authority, 479 U.S. 418, 423 \n9  (1987), 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is available to enforce violations of federal statutes by agents of a state with two \n10  exceptions:  where  Congress has  foreclosed  such enforcement and  where  the  statute did not create \n11  enforceable rights within the meaning of § 1983.  The Court stated, as to the first exception, that \"we \n12  conclude that nothing in the Housing Act ... evidences that Congress intended to preclude ... [a]§ 1983 \n13  claim against [a PHA].\"  Id. at 429.  In regards to the second exception, the Supreme Court has retreated \n14  from its position in Wright that spending legislation automatically gives rise to enforceable rights under \n15  § 1983.  As delineated in Gonzaga Universitv v.  Doe, 536 U.S.  273, 281  (2002): \"Our more recent \n16  decisions, however, have rejected attempts to infer rights from Spending Clause statutes.\" The Court went \non to state: \n17 \nWe now reject the notion that our cases permit anything short of an \n18 \nunambiguously conferred right to support a cause of action brought under \n§ 1983.  Section 1983 provides a remedy only for the deprivation of\"rights, \n19 \nprivileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\" of the \nUnited States. Accordingly, it is rights, not the broader or vaguer \"benefits\" \n20 \nor \"interests,\" that may be enforced under the authority of that section. This \nbeing so, we further reject the notion that our implied right of action cases \n21 \nare separate and distinct from our§ 1983 cases. To the contrary, our implied \nright of action cases should guide the determination of whether a statute \n22 \nconfers rights enforceable under § 1983. \n23 \nWe  have recognized that  whether a statutory violation may be \nenforced through  § 1983  '·is a different  inquiry than that involved in \n24 \ndetermining  whether  a private  right  of action  can  be  implied from  a \nparticular statute.\"  Wilder,  supra, 496 U.S.  498  at 508, n.9.  But the \n25 \ninquiries overlap in one meaningful respect - in either case we must first \ndetermine whether Congress intended to create a federal right.  Thus, we \n26 \nhave held that \"[t]he question whether Congress ... intended to create a \nprivate right of action [is] definitively answered in the negative\" where \"a \n27 \nstatute by its terms grants  no  private rights to  any  identifiable class.\" \nTouche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U.S. 560, 576 (1979).  For a statute \n28 \n7 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-GW-FFM   Document 90   Filed 03/08/09   Page 21 of 25   Page ID #:572\nto create such private rights, its text must be \"phrased in terms of the persons \n1 \nbenefited.\"  Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441  U.S. 677, 692, n.  13 \n2  (1979). * * * * But even where a statute is phrased in such explicit rights \ncreating terms, a plaintiff suing under an implied right of action still must \nshow that the statute manifests an intent \"to create not just a private right but \n3 \nalso a private remedy.\"  Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275,286 (2001) \n(emphases omitted). \n4 \nId. at 283-84.  See also Hill v. Richardson, 7 F.3d 656, 658 (7th Cir. 1993) (\"Wright was closely divided, \n5 \nand Suter [v . Artist M., 503 U.S. 34 7 (1992)] shows that the Court is unwilling to press Wright for the most \n6 \nit can be worth.\"). \n7 \nIn this case, Plaintiffs are not claiming that the HACLA's decision to reduce voucher payment \n8 \nstandard amounts was unlawful, improper or beyond its authority. Thus, while S8HVPs may be a federally \n9 \nsecured right, HACLA's reduction of the VPSA has not violated that right.  Rather, Plaintiffs' actual \n10 \ncomplaint is as to a purported failure by HAC LA to give adequate notice before effectuating the reduction. \n11 \nWhile such failure of notice may give rise to a due process complaint that could in tum give rise to a§ 1983 \n12 \nclaim (which is, in essence, the substance ofPlaintiffs' FCA),4 inadequate notice by itself is not otherwise \n13 \ncognizable as a § 1983 deprivation of rights claim. \n14 \nFirst, the applicable federal statute does not require any notice to be given before a PHA reduces \n15 \nthe VPSA so long as the reduction is not less than 90 percent of the FMR published by HUD for the \n16 \ndesignated geographic area within the PHA's jurisdiction.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o).  Therefore, even if \n17 \nHACLA's notice in this case was inadequate, such conduct would not violate a federal statute so as to give \n18 \nrise to a§ 1983 claim under the previously established (but now questioned) holding in Wright that § 1983 \n19 \nis available to enforce violations of federal statutes by agents of a State. \n20 \nSecond, Plaintiffs cite to HUD's regulation at 24 C.F.R. § 982.505(c)(3) for the existence of such \n21 \n22  notice requirement and then argue that the failure to comply with that regulation gives rise to the § 1983 \nclaim.  That contention must fail in light of the decision in Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001). \n23 \nIn Alexander, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that, where a regulation contains some \"rights-\n24 \ncreating language,\" the regulation can provide a basis for private enforcement under § 1983 that goes \n25 \nbeyond what the statute itself requires.  Id. at 291 and 293 fnt. 8.  As stated by the Court: \n26 \n27 \nFor purposes of deciding this motion, this Court need not and does not reach a decision as to whether a failure to give \n28  adequate notice would constitute a due process violation which can be litigated as a§ 1983 claim in this case. \n8 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-GW-FFM   Document 90   Filed 03/08/09   Page 22 of 25   Page ID #:573\nLanguage in a regulation may invoke a private right of action that Congress \n1 \nthrough statutory text created, but it may not create a right that Congress has \n2  not.  Touche Ross &  Co.  v.  Redington, 442 U.S., at 577 n.  18 (\"[T]he \nlanguage of the statute and not the rules must control\").  Thus, when a \nstatute has provided a general authorization for private enforcement of \n3 \nregulations, it may perhaps be correct that the intent displayed in  each \nregulation can determine whether or not it is privately enforceable. But it is \n4 \nmost certainly incorrect to say that language in a regulation can conjure up \na private cause of action that has not been authorized by Congress. Agencies \n5 \nmay play the sorcerer's apprentice but not the sorcerer himself. \n6 \nld. at 291.  See also Save Our Valley v. Sound Transit, 335 F.3d 932, 936-940 (9th Cir. 2003). \n7 \nPlaintiffs' reliance on the Wright decision and Johnson v. Housing Authority of Jefferson Parish, \n8 \n442 F.3d 356 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 127 S.Ct. 136 (2006), is unavailing.  In both of those cases, the \n9 \ndisputes revolved around the allocation of utilities expenses; in Wright it was a claim of over-billing for \n10 \nutilities by the defendant City Housing Authority (see 479 U.S. at 419), and in Johnson it was the failure \n11 \nof the defendant PHA to use current rates in calculating the utility allowance (see 442 F.3d at 359).  As \n12 \nexplained in Johnson: \n13 \n... the statutory language of the voucher program unmistakably provides -\nin the text of the act itself- for an \"amount [to be] allowed for tenant paid \n14 \nutilities.\"  [42  U.S.C.  §  1437f(o)(2)(A),  (B).]  Contrary to  the  Housing \nAuthority's assertion, the HUD regulations are not necessary to establish \n15 \nPlaintiff-Appellants' right to the utility allowance, and certainly no more so \nthan they were in Wright, where such an allowance was not even mentioned \n16 \nin the text of the statute itself.  Congress's intent to benefit Plaintiffs \nAppellants here cannot be gainsaid. \n17 \nld. at 364 (footnote omitted). In both Wright and Johnson, the claims were based on the statutory right to \n18 \nreceive the correct amount of rent assistance payments as delineated in the Housing Act as amended. Here, \n19 \nunlike the Wright and Johnson cases, Plaintiffs are not challenging the PHA's calculation as to the amount \n20 \nof the assistance as set forth in the statute.  Rather, they are raising an issue of adequacy of notice which \n21 \n22  is not required in the applicable statute but only in the regulation. Thus, the Wright and Johnson decisions \nare inapplicable, while the holdings in Alexander and Save Our Valley are controlling. \n23 \nMoreover, even assuming arguendo that a violation of a notice provision in a regulation (that is not \n24 \nrequired by the underlying statute) can serve theoretically as a basis for a § 1983 action, Plaintiffs would \n25 \nstill not have stated a cognizable claim for two reasons. First, HAC LA has not violated the notice provision \n26 \nas set out in the regulation.  Second, if the notice provision requires more than what HACLA provided, it \n27 \nis too vague and amorphous to confer an enforceable right. \n28 \n9 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-GW-FFM   Document 90   Filed 03/08/09   Page 23 of 25   Page ID #:574\nPlaintiffs claim that the notice provided by HAC LA was inadequate because it: 1) did not require \n1 \n2  the recipient to acknowledge receipt by signing and returning the form; 2) was not on HACLA letterhead; \n3) did not contain a phone number for inquiries; 4) did not state a legal basis for the decision; and 5) did \n3 \n4  not advise the recipient ofhow much their out of pocket rent payments would increase.  See FAC ~'s 29 \nand 59. However, the only regulation cited by Plaintiffs does not state that any of those items are required. \n5 \n24 C.F.R. § 982.505(c)(3)(ii) merely provides that, after a PHA has calculated the appropriate payment \n6 \nstandard amount at the first yearly reexamination following the decrease in the VPSA, \"the PHA shall \n7 \nadvise the family that the application of the lower payment standard amount will be deferred until the \n8 \nsecond regular reexamination following the effective date oft he decrease in the payment standard amount.\" \n9 \nIt makes no reference to having the recipient acknowledge receipt, letterhead, phone numbers, explanation \n10 \nof the legal basis for its decision, etc. \n11 \nPlaintiffs have not alleged that HAC LA failed in fact to give the only advisal that is required by the \n12 \nlanguage of24 C.F.R. § 982.505(c)(3)(ii). Moreover, 24 C.F.R. § 982.5, which sets out the only condition \n13 \nfor notice, merely states that \"[w   ]here Part 982 requires any notice to be given by the PHA ... , the notice \n14 \nmust be in writing.\"  Here, Plaintiffs in paragraph 4 of the F AC indicate that HACLA did give written \n15 \nnotice. \n16 \nIt is further noted that where specific information is required to be given to a S8HVP participant, \n17 \n18  the HUD regulation will set forth these requirements.  See,~' 24 C.F.R. §§ 982.301(b) and 982.554(a). \nLikewise, where a participant can challenge the PHA decision, the PHA must give that participant notice \n19 \nof the availability of an informal hearing.  However, a PHA's decision setting the VPSA within the basic \n20 \nrange is not subject to informal hearings.  24 C.F.R. § 982.555. \n21 \n22  Finally, in order for a court to conclude that a statute creates a right enforceable under § 1983, it \nmust find: 1) the statute was intended to benefit the plaintiffs; 2) the statute imposes a binding obligation \n23 \non the government unit rather than merely expressing a congressional preference for a certain kind of \n24 \nconduct, and 3) the interest asserted by the plaintiff is not so vague and amorphous that it is beyond the \n25 \ncompetence of the judiciary to enforce.  See Wilder v. Virginia Hosp. Ass'n., 496 U.S. 498, 509 (1990); \n26 \nLegal Services ofN. Calif. v. Arnett, 114 F.3d 135, 138 (9th Cir. 1997).  Here, as noted above, the statute \n27 \ndoes not impose any obligation (let alone a binding one) in regards to notice.  Even if one were to utilize \n28 \n10 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-GW-FFM   Document 90   Filed 03/08/09   Page 24 of 25   Page ID #:575\nthe referenced regulation as an appropriate surrogate for a statute, 24 C.P.R. § 982.505(c)(3)(ii) does not \n1 \n2  set out any binding obligation insofar as the procedural requirements which Plaintiffs seek to impose(~, \nacknowledgment of receipt of notice, explanation oflegal basis, telephone numbers, etc.). Moreover, aside \n3 \nfrom the due process claim which is the subject of the FCA, the interest asserted by Plaintiffs in the SCA \n4 \n5  is so vague and amorphous that it fails to confer on S8HVP participants an enforceable \"right\" within the \nmeaning of§ 1983. \n6 \nFor all ofthe above reasons, the SCA is dismissed with prejudice. \n7 \nC.  Plaintiffs' Fifth Cause of Action \n8 \nPlaintiffs' fifth cause of action is for negligence based on California Government Code § 815 .2, \n9 \nEvidence Code§ 669, and Civil Code§ 1714.  None of those provisions provides a basis for Plaintiffs' \n10 \nnegligence claim. \n11 \nAs stated in Eastburn v. Regional Fire Protection Agency, 31 Ca1.4th 1175, 1179 (2003): \n12 \n... the California Tort Claims Act provides that \"[a] public entity is not \n13 \nliable for an injury,\" \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute.\"  (Gov. \nCode,§ 815, subd. (a).)  As that language indicates, the intent ofthe Tort \n14 \nClaims Act is to confine potential governmental liability, not expand it. \n(Zelig v. County of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal. 4th 1112, 1127. \n15 \nCivil Code§ 1714(a) states that \"Everyone is responsible ... for an injury occasioned to another by his or \n16 \nher want of ordinary care or skill in the management of his or her property or person .... \"  Eastburn held \n17 \nthat the ordinary negligence liability provision in Civil Code§ 1714 is inapplicable to public entities.  As \n18 \nstated in Eastburn, 31 Cal. 4th at 1183: \n19 \nIn other words, direct tort liability of public entities must be based on a \n20 \nspecific statute declaring them to be liable, or at least creating some specific \nduty of care, and not on the general tort provisions of Civil Code section \n21 \n1714. Otherwise, the general rule of immunity for public entities would be \n22  largely eroded by the routine application of general tort principles. \nGovernment Code§ 815.2(a) provides that: \"A public entity is liable for injury proximately caused \n23 \nby an act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment if the act or \n24 \nomission would, apart from this section, have given rise to a cause of action against that employee or his \n25 \npersonal representative [emphasis added].\"  § 815.2(a) does not provide a basis for a ~ommon law claim \n26 \nfor negligence against a public entity for its own negligent conduct.  As stated in Zelig v. County of Los \n27 \nAngeles, 27 Cal.4th 1112, 1127 (2002) (emphasis omitted): \n28 \n11 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-GW-FFM   Document 90   Filed 03/08/09   Page 25 of 25   Page ID #:576\nThe Tort Claims Act draws a clear distinction between the liability of a \n1 \npublic entity based on its own conduct, and the liability arising from the \n2  conduct of a public employee.  Although the Act provides that a public \nemployee generally is  liable for an injury caused by his  or her act or \nomission \"to the same extent as a private person\" (Gov. Code.,§ 820, subd. \n3 \n(a)) and that, when the act or omission of the public employee occurs in the \n4  scope of employment the public entity will be vicariously liable for the \ninjury  (Gov.  Code  §  815.2),  the  Act  contains  no  provision  similarly \n5  providing that a public entity generally is liable for its own conduct or \nomission to the same extent as a private person or entity.  Rather, the Act \n6  provides that a public entity is not liable for an injury\"[ e ]xcept as otherwise \nprovided by statute ....\"   (Gov. Code,§ 815.) \n7 \nEvidence Code § 669( a) provides that a \"failure of a person to exercise ordinary case is presumed \n8 \nif: (1) He violated a statute, ordinance, or regulation of a public entity ....\"   However, as noted in \n9 \nCalifornia Service Station etc. Assn. v. American Home Assurance Co., 62 Cal.App.4th 1166, 1177-78 \n10 \n(1998), a claim of ordinary negligence must be viable before the presumption of negligence in Evidence \n11 \nCode§ 669(a) can be employed.  The mere fact that a person has violated a statute or regulation does not, \n12 \nby itself, establish that the result will be the tort of negligence.  Id . at 1178-79.  Plaintiffs have offered \n13 \nnothing to suggest that a purported failure to provide adequate notice under 24 C.P.R.§ 982.505(c)(3)(ii) \n14 \nshould be treated as negligence.  Moreover, as discussed above, Plaintiffs' allegations in the FAC do not \n15 \nset forth a basis for finding that HACLA has violated the notice requirement of§ 982.505(c)(3)(ii).  That \n16 \nregulation does not delineate any duty or standard of care as to how the ad vi sal is to be given. To the extent \n17 \nthat the HUD regulations in 24 C.F.R. Part 982 can be said to set forth a duty of care regarding notice, as \n18 \ndiscussed above, HACLA has complied with it. \n19 \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n20 \nFor the reasons stated above and at the hearings on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, the second and \n21 \nfifth causes of action in the FA  C are hereby dismissed with prejudice. \n22 \n23 \nDATED: November  ~~ , 2007. \n24  &~:z~ ~ ttL--. \nGEORGEH.

INTRODUCTION\n2  1.  For over thirty years, the federal ttsection 8 Program'' has provided\n3  housing benefits across the country to a highly vulnerable population comprised of\n4  impoverished, elderly, and often disabled residents, many of whom would swell\n5  the ranks of the homeless but for this clitical govemment assistance. Housing\n6  benefits are provided in the form of a ttvoucher'' or housing subsidy which\n7  supplements the am ount paid by the recipient for rent and utilities.\n8  2.  ln or around July of 2005, the Housing Authority of the City of Los\n9  Angeles (ECHACLA''), which administers the Section 8 Program locally, began\n10  implementing a large-scale rollback of housing benefits provided to Section 8\n1 l  recipients in its jurisdiction. The reduction was significant, averaging $121 per\n12  month, or over 10% of a typical recipient's household income.\n13  3.  Before doing so, however, HACLA was required by applicable\n14  federal regulations, independently enforceable as well through state law, to provide\n15  adequate notice at least one year prior to the cut in the level of services. This\n16  specitic and mandatory one-year notice requirement was created so that recipients\n17  facing a benefit decrease would have sufticient time to either look for alternative\n18  housing, or make other arrangements to accommodate this significant change in\n19  assistance.\n20  4.  HACLA did not make any meaningful attempt to comply with this\n21  notice requirement. Rather than separately providing a formal administrative\n22  notice informing Section 8 recipients that they would be responsible for a specitic\n23  increase in rent, HACLA inserted into a large stack of materials sent to each\n24  recipient a nondescript and technically worded flyer that failed to convey any\n25  useful information relating to the change in benefits.  This tlyer had absolutely no\n26  indicia of proper notice: it was not printed on letterhead; it did not specify the\n27  legal basis for the action; it did not provide a phone number for inquiries; it did not\n28  z\nFIRST AM ENDED CLASS ACTION COM PLAINT\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 49   Filed 05/23/07   Page 3 of 42   Page ID #:3801\nl  specify any procedure for appeal; it did not require a signature acknowledging\n2  receipt; and, most importantly, it did not inform recipients that their rent payments\n3  would be going up.\n4  5.  HACLA'S absolute failure to comply with the Section 8 notice\n5  requirements renders the subsequent implementation of the subsidy reduction\n6  unlawful. It constitutes a uniform due process violation of a1l affected recipients'\n7  property interest in this federal program. As a result, over 23,000 Section 8\n8  recipients living in Los Angeles (including nearly 5,000 elderly families and 4,500\n9  disabled families) literally and figuratively had the rug pulled out from under them.\n10  They have been and will continue to be unlawfully deprived of federal housing\nl 1  benefits estimated at over $25 rnillion.\n12  6.  The actions of a1l defendants have resulted in the denial of Plaintiffs'\n13  and the class members' constitutional, statutory, and comm on 1aw rights.\n14  Furthermore, the acts of Defendants demonstrate an affirmative policy, and/or\n15  custom, and/or practice of condoning the conduct set out herein.\n16  7.  This action seeks class-wide relief to enjoin Defendants' continuing\n17  violations, and to provide restitm ion to the class of affected Section 8 recipients\n18  who suffered an unlawful increase in their rent. lt is ideally suited for Rule 23\n19  class treatment because Defendants' failure to provide constimtionally adequate\n20  notice is a direct result of a policy and practice that was applied uniformly to a11\n21  affected class members.\n22  II.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n23  8.  This is a civil action over which this Court has original jurisdiction\n24  under 28 U.S.C. j1331 in that it seeks redress under 42 U.S.C. j1983 (Edsection\n25  1983'1) for the deprivation, tmder color of state law, of rights, privileges, and\n26  immunities secured by federal statutes and the United States Constitm ion.

Plaintiffs' action for\n2  declaratory and injunctive relief is authorized by 20 U.S.C. jj220l, 2202, and\n3  1343, and by Fed. R. Civ. P. 57 and 65. Plaintiffs' state 1aw claims are so related\n4  to their federal 1aw claims that they form part of the same case or controversy.\n5  Accordingly, supplementaljurisdiction over those claims is appropriate under 28\n6  U.S.C. j1367.\n7  9.  Venue in this Court is proper under 20 U.S.C. j1391(b) because\n8  various Defendants reside in this judicial district. The events or omissions giving\n9  rise to the claims occurred primarily in this judicial district.\n10  111.  PARTIES\n1 1  l0.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n24 A.  Background of Section 8 Program\n25 21.  The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 authorized\n26 and established the Section 8 Program to be administered by the local Public\n27 Housing Authorities (&(PHA's''). The Section 8 Program, funded by the U.S.\n28 6\nFG ST AM ENDED CLASS ACTION COM PLAW T\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 49   Filed 05/23/07   Page 7 of 42   Page ID #:3805\nl  Department of Housing and Urban Development (ç$HUD''), provides housing\n2  assistance a portion of rent and utilities, to extremely 1ow and very low-incom e\n, \n3  families\nsenior citizens, and disabled or handicapped persons. lts objective is to\n, \n4  ide affordable\nprov decent and safe housing for eligible families, while increasing a\n, \n5  f ,\namily s residential mobility and choice.\n6\n22.  ln 1975, HACLA implemented the Section 8 Program providing rent\n7\n8 subsidies in the form of housing assistance payments (HAPs) to private landlords\non behalf of eligible families in Los Angeles. HACLA, a state chartered public\n9\n10 housing agency since 1938, now administers the second largest Section 8 Program\n1 1 in the country.\n12  23.  ln M ay 1999, HUD created a new Section 8 Program called the\n13  dtl-lousing Choice Voucher Program .'' The local PHA administers the Housing\n14  Choice Voucher Program under contract with HUD, and has, among others, the\n15  responsibility of determining the Voucher Payment Standard ((EVPS'') - the\n16  maximum m onthly subsidy a Housing Authority can provide to a family\nSee 24\n. \n17  C F R j982\n505(4. The VPS is the subsidy generally needed to allow a Section 8\n.\n1 8\nrecipient to rent a moderately-priced dwelling unit in the local housing market, and\n1 9 i\ns used to calculate the amount of housing assistance a family will receive.\n20\n24.  HACLA'S latest website indicates that it administers over 36,000\n2 1\nSection 8 Housing Choice Voucher tenancies in the City of Los Angeles. These\n22\n23 tenancies are comprised of 59% families with children, 27% elderly individuals,\n24 and 14% non-elderly disabled persons. Sources of income for these families\n25  include wages (22%), Supplemental Security Income (d&SS1'')(20%), CaIWORKS\n26  (1914, Social Security Disability lncome (&ûSSD1'') and Social Security Retirement\n27  lncome (ttSSA'') (1384), General Relief (4%), and 23% coming 9om other and\n28 7\nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COM PLAW T\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 49   Filed 05/23/07   Page 8 of 42   Page ID #:3806\n1  combined sources.\n2  B Framework for Decreasing the VPS\n. \n3  25  Under HUD regulations\nHousing Authorities conduct annual re-\n, \n4  minations to verify income and recertify family composition\nexa 24 C.F.R.\n. \n5  982 ,\n5164a). With that information, the Housing Authority calculates the tenant s\n.\n6\nshare of rent, which is subtracted from the gross rent to determine the paym ent due\n7\nfrom the Housing Authority. The maximum Housing Authority payment is the\n8\nVPS for an apartment of that size.\n9\nl 0 26.  PHAS have discretion to raise or lower the VPS within a statutorily-\n1 1 prescribed range.\n12  27.  Before lowering the VPS, however, Housing Authorities must comply\n13  with a very specitic timeline relating to notice. A PHA must provide proper notice\n14  to a recipient whose benefits are being reduced at the lirst annual re-examination\n15  following the change in services. 24 C F.R. 982.505(c)(3)(ii). The actual\n.\n16  reduction in benefits cannot occur until one year after this notice upon the\n, \n17  letion of the second re\ncomp examination after the effective date of the decision to\n-\n18 d\necrease the level of services. 1d.\n1 9\nC.  HACLA 'S Failure to Provide Notice\n20\n28.  On April 2, 2004, HACLA m ade a decision to reduce the pre-existing\n2 1\nVPS. The impact on Section 8 participants was significant. For example, the VPS\n22\n23 for a O-bedroom (<çbachelor'') apartment plurnmeted from $795 to only $674, a\n24 reduction of $ l21 per month.\n25 29.  To implement this change in policy, HACLA stuck a one-page flyer in\n26  the m aterials m ailed to each recipient on the date of their annual re-examination.\n27  Unlike other explanatory notices contained in these packets, the flyer did not\n28 8\nFIRST AM ENDED CLASS ACTION COM PLAINT\nl\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 49   Filed 05/23/07   Page 9 of 42   Page ID #:3807\nl  require the recipient to acknowledge receipt by signing and returning the form .\n2  The flyer was not on letterhead did not contain a phone number for inquiries, and\n, \n3  did not give a legal basis for the decision\nM ore importantly, the flyer did not\n. \n4  d ise recipients that their out\na v of-pocket rent payment would actually be going up,\n-\n5\nmuch less specify the amount of the increase. Plaintiffs are informed and believe,\n6\nand on that basis allege, that these flyers were sent out, buried among other re-\n7\nexamination materials, from approximately July 2004 through July 2005.\n8\n30.  The language of the tlyer did not meaningfully conununicate to the\n9\n10 recipient that there would actually be a reduction in the portion of his or her rent\n1 l that HACLA would pay, and a corresponding increase in the portion of his or her\n12  rent that the recipient would be required to pay.\n13  31.  The VPS decrease went into effect with re-examinations that took\n14  place from July 2005 through July 2006. According to HACLA estimates,\n15  approximately 45% of HACLA'S approximately 45,000 Section 8 participants\n16  were adversely affected by the April 2004 VPS decrease\n.\n17  D  Tlle Representative Plaintiffs\n@\n1 8 32\nM ichael NOZZI is a 53-year-o1d man who is considered totally and\n. \n1 9\npermanently disabled by Social Security standards due to HIV/AIDS.

Effective February 1, 2006, PELAEZ'S Section 8 rent obligation was\n13  increased to $252.00 per month (a 177% increase). PELAEZ received nothing\n14  from HACLA informing her of this significant increase until on or around\n15  December 28 2005, just five weeks prior to the effective date of increase, and far\n, \n16  from the one year or more required by 24 C\nF.R. 982.505(c)(3)(ii).

The 177% increase in the monthly rent that PELAEZ has had to pay\n22\n23 since February l , 2006, has reduced the quality of life for her and her young\n24 daughter.

There would be enormous economies to the  I\n5  court and the parties in litigating the conzmon issues on a class-wide basis.\n6  Plaintiffs' proof of liability will be based on the factual and legal nature of\n7  HACLA'S pup orted notice, which was distributed in the sam e way to a11 members\n8  of the class.\n9  b I\nProsecution of separate actions by individual members of the\n. \n10  class would create a risk that inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to\n1 1  individual members of the class would establish incompatible standards of conduct\n12  for the parties opposing the class.\nl 3  c.  The size of each proposed class member's individual claim s for\n14  damages and/or restitution is too small to make individual litigation an\n15  economically viable alternative. Given the amounts, and the complexity of the\n16  issues, few proposed class members would have the interest or ability to prosecute\nl 7  separate actions individually.\n18  e.  Despite the relatively small size of individual claims, their\n19  aggregate volume coupled with the economies of scale inherent in litigating similar\n20  claims on a comm on basis will enable this case to be litigated as a class action on a\n21  cost-effective basis. No unusual difficulties are likely to be encountered in the\n22  management of this class in that questions of law or fact to be litigated at the\n23  liability stage are common to the class, as are injunctive, declaratory, and\n24  restitm ionary relief issues.\n25  52.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that\n26  Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby\n27  making appropriate final injunctive relief or declaratory relief with respect to the\n28  14\nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 49   Filed 05/23/07   Page 15 of 42   Page ID #:3813\n1  class as a whole.\n2  COUNT ONE\n3  DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS OF LAW\n4 (42 U.S.C. j1983)\n5  (Bv Plaintiff and Plaintiff Class Azainst HACLA)\n6  53.  Plaintiffs restate, reallege, and incop orate by reference all previous\n7  and subsequently stated paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.\n8  54.  The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendm ent prohibits\n9  government officials, and those acting in concert with them, acting under color of\n10  law, from depriving persons of their property without due process of law.\n1 l  55.  Defendants were obligated to provide notice to the Class of the VPS\n12  decrease at the lirst annual re-examination following the change in services. 24\n13  C.F.R. 982.505(c)(3)(ii). The actual reduction in benetits cannot occur until one\n14  year after this notice, upon the completion of the second re-examination after the\n15  effective date of the decision to decrease the level of services. 1d. By the terms of\n16  this regulation, the Plaintiff Class had a property interest in the VPS and the\n17  process by which it could be changed.\n18  56.  Under Califomia law, Govt. Code j815.6, 24 C.F.R. 982.505(c)(3)(ii)\n19  constitutes an enactment designed to protect the Plaintiff Class from the type of\n20  injury suffered by Plaintiffs herein. Under that California statute, where the\n21  govem ment entity involved has violated the terms of the enactment, has failed to\n22  use reasonable diligence in discharging its duty under the enactment, and has\n23  thereby injured the Plaintiffs, the injured party may sue. Accordingly, the Plaintiff\n24  Class had an independent property interest in the regulation as incorporated into\n25  Govt. Code j8 15.6 pursuant to California law.\n26  57.  Furthermore, Plaintiffs had a protected property interest in their\n27  Voucher Payment Standard pursuant to the provisions of 42 U.S.C. j l437f(o).\n28  15\nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 49   Filed 05/23/07   Page 16 of 42   Page ID #:3814\nI\n1  58.  Thus, Plaintiffs had a property interest in the provisions of C.F.R.\n2  982.505(c)(3)(ii) under both state and federal law, and both independently (i.e., the\n3  regulation, the state statute, and the federal statute each standing alone) and\n4  collectively (i.e., the three considered together in light of each). The deprivation of  j\n5  that interest by Defendants is pcrmissible only in accordance with the requirements\n6  of due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n7  59.  By failing to provide Plaintiff Class clear or meaningful notice of the\n8  actions HACLA intended to take and its consequences at the time required by 24\n9  C I\nF.R. 982.505(c)(3)(ii), most particularly by failing to meaningfully or effectively\n.\n10  advise the Plaintiff Class that their out of pocket share of future rents would be\n1 1  increased, as is more fully explained in !4, supra; and by failing to indicate from\n12  whom the notice emanated, the legal basîs for the action, a phone number for\nl 3  inquiries, or how to protest or appeal the action, Defendant HACLA deprived the\n14  Plaintiff Class of due process of 1aw in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment,\n15  thereby entitling the Class to bring suit and recover damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n16  51983.\n17  60.  The wrongful conduct complained of herein was the product of a\nl 8  policy and practice of the Defendants, was not the product of accident or\n19  inadvertence, and was not random . ln so acting, Defendants were deliberately\n20  indifferent to the rights of Plaintiffs and the Class, and acted in willful and reckless\n21  disregard of the rights of Plaintiffs and the Class.\n22  61 .  As a direct and proximate cause of the aforementioned acts of\n23  Defendants, Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Class suffered losses in that they incurred\n24  increased rental payments from their own pockets that Defendants were not legally\n25  entitled to impose. Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class seek injunctive and declaratory\n26  relief, an accounting, restitm ion, and/or damages.

INTRODUCTION \n17 \nPlaintiffs in this action are two recipients of federal benefits under the \"Section 8 Housing Voucher \n18 \nProgram\" (henceforth \"S8HVP\") pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o ) and a non-profit advocacy organization. \n19 \nDefendants are the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (henceforth \"HACLA\") and Rudolf \n20 \nMontiel, the Executive Director ofHACLA. \n21 \nIn their First Amended Class Action Complaint (henceforth \"FA  C\"), Plaintiffs allege that: \n22 \n2.  In or around July of2005, the Housing Authority of the City \n23  of Los Angeles (\"HACLA\"), which administers the Section 8 Program \nlocally, began implementing a  large-scale rollback of housing benefits \n24  provided to Section 8 recipients in its jurisdiction. [ * * * *]. \n25  3.  Before  doing  so,  however,  HACLA  was  required  by \napplicable federal regulations, independently enforceable as well through \n26  state law, to provide adequate notice at least one year prior to the cut in the \n* * \nlevel of services. [  * *]. \n27 \n4.  HACLA did not make any meaningful attempt to comply \n28  with this notice requirement.  Rather than separately providing a formal \nadministrative notice informing Section 8 recipients that they would be \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 63   Filed 11/26/07   Page 2 of 12   Page ID #:47\nresponsible for a specific increase in rent, HAC LA inserted into a large stack \n1  ofm  aterials sent to each recipient a nondescript and technically worded flyer \nthat failed  to  convey any useful  information relating to the  change in \n2  benefits. \n3  See FAC at rs 2, 3 and 4.  Plaintiffs raise five causes of action:  I) \"Denial of Due Process of Law (42 \n4  U.S.C. § 1983)\" for failing to provide notice to S8HVP recipients pursuant to 24 C.F.R. § 982.505(c)(3)(ii) \n5  before implementing the rollback of housing benefits which are a protected property interest under 42 \n6  U.S.C. § 1437f(o); 2) \"ViolationofRights Created by42 U.S.C. § 1437f(Private Right of Action Available \n7  under 42 U.S.C. § 1983)\"; 3) \"Violation of Cal. Gov't. Code§ 815.6\"; 4) \"Violation of Art. I,§ 7 of \n8  California Constitution\"; and 5) \"Negligence\" pursuant to California Government Code § 815 .2, Civil Code \n9  § I 714 and Evidence Code § 669.1 Defendants now move to dismiss the second and fifth causes of action. \n10  II.  BACKGROUND \n11  A.  The S8HVP \n12  As noted in Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Group. 508 U.S. 10, 12 (1993): \n13  In 1974, Congress amended the United States Housing Act of 1937 \n(Housing Act) to create what is known as the Section 8 housing program. \n14  Through the Section 8 program,  Congress hoped to \"ai[d]  low-income \nfamilies in obtaining a decent place to live,\" 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(a) (1988 ed., \n15  Supp. III), by subsidizing private landlords who would rent to low-income \ntenants.  Under the program, tenants make rental payments based on their \n16  income  and  ability  to  pay;  the  Department  of Housing  and  Urban \nDevelopment (HUD)  then makes \"assistance payments\" to  the  private \n17  landlords in an amount calculated to make up the difference between the \ntenant's contribution and a \"contract rent\" agreed upon by the landlord and \n18  HUD. \n19  One ofthe Section 8 programs is the S8HVP.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o); 24 C.F.R. § 982.1(a)(l). \n20  The S8HVP is usually administered by a state or local governmental entity called a \"public housing agency\" \n21  or \"PHA\" within a designated geographic area.  See 24 C.F.R. § 982.l(a)(l).  HUD provides housing \n22  assistance funds to the PHAs and also supplies monies for the PHAs' administration of the programs.  Id . \n23 \n24 \nPlaintiffs' original Complaint contained two additional causes of action for \"Violation of Cal. Civ. Code§ 52.1\" (which \nthis Court dismissed without leave to amend) and \"Taxpayers' ... Suit for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief under Cal. Code of \n25 \nCivil Procedure§ 526a\" (which Plaintiffs voluntarily withdrew). Also, this Court granted Defendants' initial Motion to Dismiss \nas to the second cause of action, but with leave to amend, because it found that count to be unclear as to the basis of the claim since \n26 \nit appeared to be entirely duplicative of the first cause of action. Further, at the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss, the Court also \nheard Defendants' Motion to Strike Causes of Action Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 425.16.  In their papers \n27 \nand at the oral argument, Plaintiffs conceded that their lawsuit did not challenge the decision to lower the S8HVP benefits but \nrather the Defendants' failure to give adequate notice to recipients prior to the effectuating the change.  See~. Reporter's \n28 \nTranscript of April 30, 2007 hearing at page 12. \n2 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 63   Filed 11/26/07   Page 3 of 12   Page ID #:48\nHUD publishes the fair market rents (henceforth \"FMR\"? for designated geographic areas in the \n1 \nUnited States.  See 24 C.F.R. §§ 888.111 and 982.503(a).  A public housing agency must adopt a payment \n2 \nschedule that establishes \"voucher payment standard amounts\" (henceforth sometimes \"VPSA\") for each \n3 \nFMR area within its jurisdiction. See 24 C.F.R. § 982.503(a). As to each FMR area, the PHA must set the \n4 \nVPSA for each \"unit size\" where unit size is measured by the number of bedrooms (i.e., zero-bedroom or \n5 \nstudio, one-bedroom and so on).  Id.  The public housing agency is initially limited as to its choice of the \n6 \nvoucher payment standard amount.  As stated in 24 C.F.R. § 982.503(b)(l): \n7 \n(i) The PHA may establish the payment standard amount for a unit \n8 \nsize at any level between 90 percent and II 0 percent of the published FMR \nfor that unit size.  HUD approval is not required to establish a payment \n9 \nstandard amount in that range (\"basic range\"). \n(ii) The PHA may establish a separate payment standard amount \n10 \nwithin the basic range for a designated part of an FMR area. \n11 \nSee also 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(l)(B). \n12 \nThe voucher payment standard amount is used to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment \n13 \nfor a family. See 24 C.F.R. § 982.505(a). Where the PHA has established a VPSA within the \"basic range\" \n14 \nand where the rent for a family (including utilities except for telephone) for their particular unit falls within \n15 \nthat range, the amount of monthly assistance payment for that family will normally be: \n16 \n... the amount by which the rent (including the amount allowed for tenant \npaid utilities) exceeds the greatest of the following amounts, rounded to the \n17 \nnearest dollar: \n(i) 30 percent of the monthly adjusted income of the family. \n18 \n(ii) 10 percent ofthe monthly income of the family. \n19 \n42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(2)(A);3 see also 24 C.F.R. § 982.505(a). \n20 \nPersons seeking S8HVP assistance must apply to the PHA and supply income and other information \n21 \nto establish their eligibility to participate in the program.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(4); 24 C.F.R. § \n22 \n982.201(a) and (b).  Once in the program, the PHA must conduct, at a minimum, a yearly review of the \n23 \nfamily income and other information of the S8HVP participants.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(5); 24 C.F.R. \n24 \n§ 982.516(a). \n25 \n26 \n2  \"Fair market rent means the rent, including the cost of utilities (except telephone}, as established by HUD ... for units \nof varying sizes (by number ofbedrooms), that must be paid in the market area to rent privately owned, existing, decent, safe and \n27 \nsanitary rental housing of modest (non-luxury) nature with suitable amenities.\"  24 C.F.R. § 888.Jll(b). \n28 \n\"Adjusted income\" is defined in 42 U.S. C. § 1437a(b)(5). \n3 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 63   Filed 11/26/07   Page 4 of 12   Page ID #:49\nAs conceded by the Plaintiffs in their PAC, \"PHAs have discretion to raise or lower the VPS[A] \n1 \nwithin a statutorily prescribed range.\" SeePA  C at '1[26.  Under regulations promulgated by HUD, if a PHA \n2 \ndecreases the amounts on the payment standard schedule, \"the lower payment standard amount generally \n3 \nmust be used to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment for the family beginning at the effective \n4 \ndate of the family's second regular reexamination following the effective date of the decrease in the \n5 \npayment standard amount.\"  24 C.P.R. § 982.505(c)(3).  There is a three step process. \n6 \nDecrease  in  the  payment standard amount during  the  HAP  [housing \n7 \nassistance payments] contract term.  If the amount on the payment standard \nschedule is decreased during the term of the  HAP contract, the lower \n8 \npayment standard amount generally must be used to calculate the monthly \nhousing assistance payment for the family beginning at the effective date of \n9 \nthe family's second regular reexamination following the effective date oft he \ndecrease in the payment standard amount.  The PHA must determine the \n10 \npayment standard for the family as follows. \n11 \n(i) Step I: At the first regular reexamination following the decrease in the \npayment standard amount, the PHA shall determine the payment standard \n12 \nfor the family[ ... ] (using the decreased payment standard amount). \n13 \n(ii) Step 2 (first reexamination payment standard amount): The PHA shall \ncompare the payment standard amount from step I to the payment standard \n14 \namount last used to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment for the \nfamily.  The payment standard amount used by the PHA to calculate the \n15 \nmonthly housing assistance payment at  the  first  regular reexamination \nfollowing the decrease in the payment standard amount is the higher oft hese \n16 \ntwo payment standard amounts.  The PHA shall advise the family that the \napplication of the lower payment standard amount will be deferred until the \n17 \nsecond regular reexamination following the effective date oft he decrease in \nthe payment standard amount. \n18 \n(iii) Step 3 (second reexamination payment standard amount): At the second \n19 \nregular reexamination following  the decrease  in the  payment  standard \namount, the lower payment standard amount shall be used to calculate the \n20 \nmonthly housing assistance payment for the family unless the PHA has \nsubsequently increased the payment standard amount .... \n21 \n24 C.P.R. § 982.505(c)(3)(i) thru (iii) [emphasis added]. \n22 \nAs stated in 24 C.P.R.§ 982.5: \"Where part 982 requires any notice to be given by the PHA, the \n23 \nfamily or the owner, the notice must be in writing.\" \n24 \nB.  Operative Allegations \n25 \nIn regards to the HACLA's purported failure to provide notice to the Plaintiff class, the operative \n26 \nallegations are contained in paragraphs 28 through 31 of the PAC which state: \n27 \n28.  On April2, 2004, HAC LA made a decision to reduce the pre-\n28 \n4 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 63   Filed 11/26/07   Page 5 of 12   Page ID #:50\nexisting VPS. The impact on Section 8 participants was significant.  For \n1 \nexample, the VPS for a 0-bedroom (\"bachelor\") apartment plummeted from \n$795 to $674, a reduction of$121 per month. \n2 \n29.  To implement this change in policy, the HAC LA stuck a one-\n3 \npage flyer in the materials mailed to each recipient on the date of their \nannual re-examination. Unlike other explanatory notices contained in these \n4 \npackets, the flyer did not require the recipient to acknowledge receipt by \nsigning and returning the form.  The flyer was not on letterhead, did not \n5 \ncontain a phone number for inquiries, and did not give a legal basis for the \ndecision. More importantly, the flyer did not advise recipients that their out \n6 \nof-pocket rent payment would actually be going up, much less specifY the \namount of the increase.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that \n7 \nbasis  allege,  that  these  flyers  were  sent  out,  buried  among  other \nreexamination materials, from approximately July 2004 through July 2005. \n8 \n30.  The language oft he flyer did not meaningfully communicate \n9 \nto the recipient that there would actually be a reduction in the portion of his \nor her rent that HACLA would pay, and a corresponding increase in the \n10 \nportion of his or her rent that the recipient would be required to pay. \n11 \n31.  The VPS decrease went into effect with re-examinations that \ntook place from July 2005 to July 2006. \n12 \nSee FAC at rs 28 through 31. \n13 \nPlaintiffs' first cause of action is a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim of a denial of due process against \n14 \nDefendant HACLA.  They contend that they have \"a property interest in the provisions of [24] C.F.R. § \n15 \n16  982.505(c)(3)(ii) under both state and federal law ....\"   See FAC at~ 58.  In paragraph 59 of the FAC, \nPlaintiffs assert that: \n17 \nBy failing to provide Plaintiff Class clear or meaningful notice oft he actions \n18 \nHACLA intended to take and its consequences at the time required by 24 \nC.F.R. 982.505(c)(3)(ii), most particularly by failing to meaningfully or \n19 \neffectively advise the Plaintiff Class that their out of pocket share of future \nrents would be increased [ ... ] and by failing to indicate from whom the \n20 \nnotice emanated, the legal basis for the action, a phone number for inquiries, \nor how to protest or appeal the action, Defendant HACLA deprived the \n21 \nPlaintiff Class  of due  process  of law  in  violation  of the  Fourteenth \nAmendment,  thereby entitling the  Class  to  bring the  suit  and  recover \n22 \ndamages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n23 \nPlaintiffs seek \"injunctive and declaratory relief, an accounting, restitution and/or damages.\"  Id.  61. \nat~ \n24 \nPlaintiffs' second cause of action seeks to establish a claim based upon a purported violation of \n25 \nrights created by 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o) which allegedly can be litigated through a \"private right of action \n26 \navailable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\"  See FA  C at page 17.  As stated in paragraphs 68 and 69 of the FAC: \n27 \n68.  In sum, 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(2) and the other sections cited \nabove required HACLA to  make  monthly payments for the benefit of \n28 \n5 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 63   Filed 11/26/07   Page 6 of 12   Page ID #:51\nrecipients  according to  the \"applicable  payment  standard.\"  That  is  a \n1 \nfederally secured right.  The regulations flush [sic]  out how HACLA's \nmonthly payments are to be calculated by specifYing how the applicable \n2 \npayment standard is to be determined.  By failing to provide the required \nnotice, the new payment standard implemented by HACLA was unlawful. \n3 \nHAC LA, therefore, violated 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o ) (2) by failing to make the \nrequired payments under the \"applicable payment standard.\" \n4 \n69.  Defendants,  as  described  in  this  complaint,  deprived \n5 \nPlaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class of their federal rights, specifically their \nvoucher payment standard rights created by 42 U.S.C. § 1437f( o) , including \n6 \n§ 1437(o)(2) and§ 1437f(o)(l), under the color of state law, and thereby \nviolated 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n7 \nII.  DISCUSSION \n8 \nA.  Applicable Law \n9 \nDefendants herein seek to dismiss the second and fifth causes of action pursuant to Federal Rules \n10 \nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  As stated in Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dept., 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. \n11 \n1990). \n12 \nA complaint should not be dismissed under Rule 12(b )( 6) \"unless it appears \n13 \nbeyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his \nclaim which would entitle him to relief.\"  Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, \n14 \n45-46 (1957).  Dismissal can be based on lack of cognizable legal theory or \nthe absence of sufficient facts  alleged under a cognizable legal theory. \n15 \nRobertson v. Dean Witter Reynolds. Inc., 749 F.2d 530, 533-34 (9th Cir. \n1984).  On a motion to dismiss, the court accepts the facts alleged in the \n16 \ncomplaint as true.  Shah, 797 F.2d at 745. \n17 \nB.  Plaintiffs' Second Cause of Action \n18 \nBefore considering the viability of the Plaintiffs' Second Cause of Action (henceforth \"SCA\"), it \n19 \nshould initially be noted that Defendants have not moved to dismiss the First Cause of Action (henceforth \n20 \n\"FCA\") which asserts that HACLA violated 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by denying Plaintiffs due process in failing \n21 \nto give them sufficient notice as required by 24 C.F.R. § 982.505(c  )(3)(ii) before reducing S8HVP benefits. \n22 \nLikewise, Plaintiffs have conceded that PHAs (such as HACLA) have the discretion to lower the voucher \n23 \nprogram standard amount (which is used to calculate the S8HVP benefits) within certain limitations. \n24 \nPlaintiffs have not (and apparently do not) contend that HACLA acted substantively or procedurally in an \n25 \nunlawful manner in deciding to reduce the S8HVP benefits, except as to the notice issue.  In light of the \n26 \nabove, Plaintiffs' SCA either : 1) is simply the same claim as the FCA but stated in slightly different words, \n27 \nor 2) fails to state a cognizable legal theory other than a due process claim based on lack of notice and fails \n28 \n6 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 63   Filed 11/26/07   Page 7 of 12   Page ID #:52\nto allege sufficient facts that would establish a cognizable legal theory under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n1 \nPlaintiffs' SCA is based on the following syllogism: I) the S8VHP benefits are \"a federally secured \n2 \nright\"; 2) HUD regulations flesh out how HACLA's monthly payments are to be calculated; 3) by failing \n3 \nto provide the required notice, HACLA's reduction in S8HVP benefits is unlawful and 4) \"HACLA, \n4 \ntherefore, violated 42 U.S.C. § 1437f( o) (2) by failing to make the required payments under the 'applicable \n5 \npayment standard'\" which constitutes a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  See FAC at ~'s 68-69.  Plaintiffs' \n6 \nSCA fails to state a claim for the reasons stated below. \n7 \nAs held in Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment & Housing Authoritv, 479 U.S. 418,423 (1987), 42 \n8 \nU.S.C. § 1983 is available to enforce violations of federal statutes by agents of a state with two exceptions: \n9 \nwhere Congress has foreclosed such enforcement and where the statute did not create enforceable rights \n10 \nwithin the meaning of§ 1983.  The Court stated, as to the first exception, that \"we conclude that nothing \n11 \nin the Housing Act ... evidences that Congress intended to preclude ... [a] § 1983 claim against [a PHA].\" \n12 \nId. at 429.  In regards to the second exception, the Supreme Court has retreated from its position in Wright \n13 \nthat spending legislation automatically gives rise to enforceable rights under§ 1983.  As delineated in \n14 \nGonzaga Universitv v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 281 (2002): \"Our more recent decisions, however, have rejected \n15 \nattempts to infer rights from Spending Clause statutes.\"  The Court went on to state: \n16 \nWe now reject the notion that our cases permit anything short of an \n17 \nunambiguously conferred right to support a cause of action brought under \n§ 1983. Section 1983 provides a remedy only for the deprivation of\"rights, \n18 \nprivileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\" of the \nUnited States. Accordingly, it is rights, not the broader or vaguer \"benefits\" \n19 \nor \"interests,\" that may be enforced under the authority of that section. This \nbeing so, we further reject the notion that our implied right of action cases \n20 \nare separate and distinct from our§ 1983 cases. To the contrary, our implied \nright of action cases should guide the determination of whether a statute \n21 \nconfers rights enforceable under§ 1983. \n22 \nWe have  recognized that  whether a statutory violation may be \nenforced through  §  1983  \"is a  different inquiry than that involved  in \n23 \ndetermining whether a  private  right of action  can be  implied  from  a \nparticular statute.\"  Wilder. supra, 496 U.S. 498 at 508, n.  9.  But the \n24 \ninquiries overlap in one meaningful respect -- in either case we must first \ndetermine whether Congress intended to create a federal right.  Thus, we \n25 \nhave held that \"the question whether Congress . . . intended to create a \nprivate right of action [is] definitively answered in the negative\" where \"a \n26 \nstatute by  its terms grants  no  private rights to  any identifiable class.\" \nTouche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U.S. 560, 576 (1979).  For a statute \n27 \nto create such private rights, its text must be \"phrased in terms oft he persons \nbenefitted.\"  Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 692, n.  13 \n28 \n7 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 63   Filed 11/26/07   Page 8 of 12   Page ID #:53\n(1979). * * * * But even where a statute is phrased in such explicit rights \n1 \ncreating terms, a plaintiff suing under an implied right of action still must \nshow that the statute manifests an intent \"to create not just a private right but \n2 \nalso a private remedy.\"  Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275,286 (2001) \n(emphases added). \n3 \nSee also Hill v. Richardson, 7 F.3d 656,658 (7th Cir. 1993) (\"Wright was closely divided, and Suter [v. \n4 \nArtist M, 503 U.S. 347 (1992)] shows that the Court is unwilling to press Wright for the most it can be \n5 \nworth.\"). \n6 \nIn this case, Plaintiffs are not claiming that the HACLA's decision to reduce voucher payment \n7 \nstandard amounts was unlawful, improper or beyond its authority. Thus, while S8HVPs may be a federally \n8 \nsecured right, HACLA's reduction of the VPSA has not violated that right.  Rather, Plaintiffs' actual \n9 \ncomplaint is as to a purported failure by HACLA to give adequate notice before effectuating the reduction. \n10 \nWhile such failure of notice may give rise to a due process complaint that could in turn give rise to a§ 1983 \n11 \nclaim (which is, in essence, the substance of Plaintiffs' FCA),4 inadequate notice by itself is not otherwise \n12 \ncognizable as a § 1983 deprivation of rights claim. \n13 \nFirst, the applicable federal statute does not require any notice to be given before a PHA reduces \n14 \nthe VPSA so long as the reduction is not Jess than 90 percent of the FMR published by HUD for the \n15 \ndesignated geographic area within the PHA'sjurisdiction.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o).  Therefore, even if \n16 \nHACLA's notice in this case was inadequate, such conduct would not violate a federal statute so as to give \n17 \nrise to a§ 1983 claim under the previously established (but now questioned) holding in Wright that§ 1983 \n18 \nis available to enforce violations of federal statutes by agents of a State. \n19 \nSecond, Plaintiffs cite to HUD's regulation at 24 C.P.R. § 982.505(c)(3) for the existence of such \n20 \nnotice requirement and then argue that the failure to comply with that regulation gives rise to the § 1983 \n21 \nclaim.  That contention must fail in light of the decision in Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001). \n22 \nIn Alexander, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that, where a regulation contains some \"rights-\n23 \ncreating language,\" the regulation can provide a basis for private enforcement under § 1983 that goes \n24 \nbeyond what the statute itself requires.  Id. at 291 and 293 fnt. 8.  As stated by the Court: \n25 \nLanguage in a regulation may invoke a private right of action that Congress \n26 \n27 \nFor purposes of deciding this motion, this Court need not and does not reach a decision as to whether a failure to give \n28 \nadequate notice would constitute a due process violation which can be litigated as a § 1983 claim in this case. \n8 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 63   Filed 11/26/07   Page 9 of 12   Page ID #:54\nthrough statutory text created, but it may not create a right that Congress has \n1 \nnot.  Touche Ross &  Co.  v.  Redington, 442 U.S., at 577 n.  18  (\"[T]he \nlanguage of the statute and not the rules must control\").  Thus, when a \n2 \nstatute has  provided a general authorization for  private enforcement of \nregulations, it may perhaps be correct that the intent displayed in each \n3 \nregulation can determine whether or not it is privately enforceable. But it is \nmost certainly incorrect to say that language in a regulation can conjure up \n4 \na private cause of action that has not been authorized by Congress. Agencies \nmay play the sorcerer's apprentice but not the sorcerer himself. \n5 \nId. at 291.  See also Save Our Valley v. Sound Transit, 335 F.3d at 932, 936-940 (9th Cir. 2003). \n6 \nPlaintiffs' reliance on the Wright decision and Johnson v. Housing Authoritv of Jefferson Parish, \n7 \n442 F.3d 356 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 127 S.Ct.  136 (2006), is unavailing.  In both of those cases, the \n8 \ndisputes revolved around the allocation of utilities expenses; in Wright it was a claim of over-billing for \n9 \nutilities by the defendant City Housing Authority (see 479 U.S. at 419), and in Johnson it was the failure \n10 \nof the defendant PHA to use current rates in calculating the utility allowance (see 442 F.3d at 359).  As \n11 \nexplained in Johnson: \n12 \n... the statutory language of the voucher program unmistakably provides- \n13 \nin the text of the act itself-- for an \"amount [to be] allowed for tenant paid \nutilities.\"  [42  U.S.C.  §  1437f(o)(2)(A),  (B).]  Contrary to  the  Housing \n14 \nAuthority's assertion, the HUD regulations are not necessary to establish \nPlaintiff-Appellants' right to the utility allowance, and certainly no more so \n15 \nthan they were in Wright, where such an allowance was not even mentioned \nin the text of the  statute itself.  Congress's intent to benefit Plaintiffs \n16 \nAppellants here cannot be gainsaid. \n17 \nId. at 364 (footnote omitted).  In both Wright and Johnson, the claims were based on the statutory right to \n18 \nreceive the correct amount of rent assistance payments as delineated in the Housing Act as amended. Here, \n19 \nunlike the Wright and Johnson cases, Plaintiffs are not challenging the PHA's calculation as to the amount \n20 \nof the assistance as set forth in the statute.  Rather, they are raising an issue of adequacy of notice which \n21 \nis not required in the applicable statute but only in the regulation. Thus, the Wright and Johnson decisions \n22 \nare inapplicable, while the holdings in Alexander and Save Our Valley are controlling. \n23 \nMoreover, even assuming arguendo that a violation of a notice provision in a regulation (that is not \n24 \nrequired by the underlying statute) can serve theoretically as a basis for a § 1983 action, Plaintiffs would \n25 \nstill not have stated a cognizable claim for two reasons. First, HAC LA has not violated the notice provision \n26 \nas set out in the regulation.  Second, if the notice provision requires more than what HACLA provided, it \n27 \nis too vague and amorphous to confer an enforceable right. \n28 \n9 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 63   Filed 11/26/07   Page 10 of 12   Page ID #:55\nPlaintiffs claim that the notice provided by HAC LA was inadequate because it: 1) did not require \n1 \nthe recipient to acknowledge receipt by signing and returning the form; 2) was not on HACLA letterhead; \n2 \n3) did not contain a phone number for inquiries; 4) did not state a legal basis for the decision; and 5) did \n3 \nnot advise the recipient of how much their out of pocket rent payments would increase.  See FAC rs 29 \n4 \nand 59. However, the only regulation cited by Plaintiffs does not state that any of those items are required. \n5 \n24 C.F.R. § 982.505(c)(3)(ii) merely provides that, after a PHA has calculated the appropriate payment \n6 \nstandard amount at the first yearly reexamination following the decrease in the VPSA, \"the PHA shall \n7 \nadvise the family that the application of the lower payment standard amount will be deferred until the \n8 \nsecond regular reexamination following the effective date oft he decrease in the payment standard amount.\" \n9 \nIt makes no reference to having the recipient acknowledge receipt, letterhead, phone numbers, explanation \n10 \nof the legal basis for its decision, etc. \n11 \nPlaintiffs have not alleged that HACLA failed in fact to give the only advisal that is required by the \n12 \nlanguage of24 C.F.R. § 982.505(c)(3)(ii). Moreover, 24 C.F.R. § 982.5 which sets out the only condition \n13 \nfor notice merely states that \"Where Part 982 requires any notice to be given by the PHA ... , the notice \n14 \nmust be in writing.\"  Here, Plaintiffs in paragraph 4 of the FAC indicate that HACLA did give written \n15 \nnotice. \n16 \nIt is further noted that where specific information is required to be given to a S8HVP participant, \n17 \n18  the HUD regulation will set forth these requirements.  See,~. 24 C.F.R. §§ 982.301(b) and 982.554(a). \nLikewise, where a participant can challenge the PHA decision, the PHA must give that participant notice \n19 \nof the availability of an informal hearing.  However, a PHA's decision setting the VPSA within the basic \n20 \nrange is not subject to informal hearings.  24 C.F.R. § 982.555. \n21 \nFinally, in order for a court to conclude that a statute creates a right enforceable under§ 1983, it \n22 \nmust find:  I) the statute was intended to benefit the plaintiffs; 2) the statute imposes a binding obligation \n23 \non the government unit rather than merely expressing a congressional preference for a certain kind of \n24 \nconduct, and 3) the interest asserted by the plaintiff is not so vague and amorphous that it is beyond the \n25 \n26  competence of the judiciary to enforce.  See Wilder v. Virginia Hosp. Asin., 496 U.S. 498,509 (1990); \nLegal Services ofNorthem Calif. v. Arnett, 114 F.3d 135, 138 (9th Cir. 1997).  Here, as noted above, the \n27 \nstatute does not impose any obligation (let alone a binding one) in regards to notice.  Even if one were to \n28 \n10 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 63   Filed 11/26/07   Page 11 of 12   Page ID #:56\nutilize the referenced regulation as an appropriate surrogate for a statute, 24 C.F.R. § 982.505(c )(3)(ii) does \n1 \nnot set out any binding obligation insofar as the procedural requirements which Plaintiffs seek to impose \n2 \n3  (~,acknowledgment ofr eceipt ofn otice, explanation oflegal basis, telephone numbers, etc.). Moreover, \naside from the due process claim which is the subject of the FCA, the interest asserted by Plaintiffs in the \n4 \nSCA is so vague and amorphous that it fails to confer on SSHVP participants an enforceable \"right\" within \n5 \nthe meaning of§ 1983. \n6 \nFor all of the above reasons, the SCA is dismissed with prejudice. \n7 \nC.  Plaintiffs' Fifth Cause of Action \n8 \nPlaintiffs' fifth cause of action is for negligence based on California Government Code § 815 .2, \n9 \nEvidence Code§ 669, and Civil C?de § 1714.  None of those provisions provides a basis for Plaintiffs' \n10 \nnegligence claim. \n11 \nAs stated in Eastburn v. Regional Fire Protection Agency, 31 Cal. 4th 1175, 1179 (2003): \n12 \n... the California Tom Claims Act provides that \"[a] public entity is not \n13 \nliable for an injury,\" \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute.\"  (Gov. \nCode,§ 815; subd. (a).)  As that language indicates, the intent of the Tort \n14 \nClaims Act is to confine potential governmental liability, not expand it. \n(Zelig v. Countv of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1112, 1127. \n15 \nCivil Code § 1714(a) states that \"Every one is responsible ... for an injury occasioned by his want of \n16 \nordinary care of skill in the management of his property or person ....\"   Eastburn held that the ordinary \n17 \nnegligence liability provision in Civil Code § 1714 is inapplicable to public entities. As stated in Eastburn, \n18 \n31 Ca1.4th at 1183: \n19 \nIn other words, direct tort liability of public entities must be based on a \n20 \nspecific statute declaring them to be liable, or at least creating some specific \nduty of care, and not on the general tort provisions of Civil Code section \n21 \n1714.  Otherwise, the general rule of immunity for public entities would be \nlargely eroded by the routine application of general tort principles. \n22 \nGovernment Code § 815.2(a) provides that: \"A public entity is liable for injury proximately caused \n23 \nby an act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment if the act or \n24 \nomission would, apart from this section, have given rise to a cause of action against that employee or his \n25 \n26  personal representative [emphases added].\"  § 815.2(a) does not provide a basis for a common law claim \nfor negligence against a public entity for its own negligent conduct.  As stated in Zelig v. Countv of Los \n27 \nAngeles, 27 Ca1.4th 1112, 1127 (2002): \n28 \n11 \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 63   Filed 11/26/07   Page 12 of 12   Page ID #:57\nThe Tort Claims Act draws a clear distinction between the liability of a \n1 \npublic entity based on its own conduct, and the liability arising from the \nconduct of a public employee.  Although the Act provides that a public \n2 \nemployee generally is  liable for  an injury caused by  his  or her act or \nomission \"to the same extent as a private person\" (Gov. Code.,§ 820, subd. \n3 \n(a)) and that, when the act or omission of the public employee occurs in the \nscope of employment the public entity will be vicariously liable for the \n4 \ninjury  (Gov.  Code  §  815.2),  the  Act  contains  no  provision  similarly \nproviding that a public entity generally is liable for its own conduct or \n5 \nomission to the same extent as a private person or entity.  Rather, the Act \nprovides that a public entity is not liable for an injury\"[ e ]xcept as otherwise \n6 \nprovided by statute ....\"   (Gov. Code,§ 815.) \n7 \nEvidence Code§ 669(a) provides that a \"failure of a person to exercise ordinary case is presumed \n8 \nif:  (1) he violated a statute, ordinance, or regulation of a public entity ....\"   However, as noted in \n9  California Service Station etc. Assn. v. American Home Assurance Co., 62 Cal.App.4th 1166, 1177-78 \n10 \n(1998), a claim of ordinary negligence must be viable before the presumption of negligence in Evidence \n11 \nCode§ 669(a) can be employed.  The mere fact that a person has violated a statute or regulation does not, \n12 \nby itself, establish that the result will be the tort of negligence.  Id. at 1178-79.  Plaintiffs have offered \n13 \nnothing to suggest that a purported failure to provide adequate notice under 24 C.F.R. § 982.505( c) (3)(ii) \n14 \nshould be treated as negligence.  Moreover, as discussed above, Plaintiffs' allegations in the FA  C do not \n15 \nset forth a basis for finding that HACLA has violated the notice requirement of§ 982.505(c)(3)(ii).  That \n16 \nregulation does not delineate any duty or standard of care as to how the advisal is to be given. To the extent \n17 \nthat the HUD regulations in 24 C.F .R. Part 982 can be said to forth a duty of care regarding notice, as \n18 \ndiscussed above, HACLA has complied with it. \n19 \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n20 \nFor the reasons stated above and at the hearings on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, the second and \n21 \nfifth causes of action in the FA  C are hereby dismissed with prejudice. \n22 \n23 \nJ.{ \nDATED: November  2007 \n24  ~~d:&-\n25 \nUnited States District Judge \n26 \n27 \n28 \n12 ",

Housing Authority for the City of Los Angeles, et al.\nPresent: The Honorable PERCY ANDERSON, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\nKamilla Sali-Suleyman  Not Reported N/A\nDeputy Clerk Court Reporter Tape No.\nAttorneys Present for Plaintiffs: Attorneys Present for Defendants:\nNone None\nProceedings:  MOTIONS FOR FINAL APPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT\nAND ATTORNEYS’ FEES\nBefore the Court are a Motion for Final Approval of Class Action Settlement (Docket No. 322)\nand a Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs (Docket No. 307) filed by plaintiffs Michael Nozzi\n(“Nozzi”) and Nidia Pelaez (“Pelaez”) (collectively “Plaintiffs” or “Named Plaintiffs”).  Defendants\nHousing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (“HACLA”) and Rudolph Montiel in his official capacity1/\n(collectively “Defendants”) do not oppose either motion.  A Fairness Hearing was held on January 29,\n2018.\nI.  FACTUAL & PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nThe Section 8 housing program provides rental assistance to low-income, elderly, and disabled\nfamilies.  See Nozzi v. HACLA, 806 F.3d 1178, 1184 (9th Cir. 2015) (“Nozzi II”).  The majority of this\nassistance is provided through the Housing Choice Voucher Program, which is funded and regulated by\nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) and administered locally by public\nhousing agencies such as HACLA.  Id.  Under this program, the renter identifies qualifying housing, the\npublic housing agency negotiates the rent with the landlord, the public housing agency pays a rent\nsubsidy to the landlord on behalf of the tenant, and the renter pays the balance of the rent.  Id.  Within\nparameters established by HUD, the public housing agency sets a voucher payment standard (VPS)\nrepresenting the maximum subsidy that it will pay for each type of housing in a particular area.  Id. at\n1185.  Raising the VPS will generally yield larger subsidies, while lowering the VPS will generally yield\nsmaller subsidies.  Id.  Each renter’s eligibility for Section 8 benefits is examined on a yearly basis.  Id. \n“If the public housing agency decides to lower the [VPS], it must provide information about the change\nto all beneficiaries at their annual reexaminations following the decision, and must further advise these\nbeneficiaries that the change will not go into effect until their following reexamination one year later.” \nId.\n1/ The City of Los Angeles was originally named as a defendant, but was dismissed on May 23,\n2007.  (Docket No. 48.)\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 1 of 12\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 331   Filed 02/15/18   Page 2 of 12   Page ID #:5961\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-380 PA (FFMx) Date February 15, 2018\nTitle Michael Nozzi, et al. v. Housing Authority for the City of Los Angeles, et al.\nHACLA reduced its VPS in 2004.  Under the new standard, an estimated 45% of tenants were\nrequired to pay an average of $104 more in rent each month.  Id. at 1186.  HACLA notified renters of\nthis change in a flyer sent with annual reexamination documents.  Id.  The flyer provided general\ninformation about the new VPS, but did not specify how the changes would affect each renter.  Id.  An\nindividualized notice was not provided until a second notice sent approximately four weeks before the\nnew subsidy would take effect for each renter.  Id.\nPlaintiffs, along with the now-defunct Los Angeles Coalition to End Hunger & Homelessness,\ninitiated this action in January 2007.  Id.  In April 2007, the district court granted in part and denied in\npart a motion to dismiss.  (Docket No. 42.)  Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint alleging\nviolations of (1) due process of law under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, (2) rights created by 42 U.S.C. § 1437f,\n(3) Cal. Gov. Code § 815.6, (4) Art. I, § 7 of the California Constitution, and (5) negligence.  (Docket\nNo. 49.)  The Court dismissed the second and fifth claims (Docket No. 63) and later granted Defendants’\nmotion for summary judgment on the remaining claims (Docket No. 90).  The Ninth Circuit reversed the\ndismissal of the fifth claim and the grant of summary judgment on the first, third, and fourth claims. \nNozzi v. HACLA, No. 09–55588, 2011 WL 1167188 (9th Cir. 2011) (“Nozzi I”).  On remand, the\ndistrict court granted HACLA’s renewed motion for summary judgment.  (Docket Nos. 190, 192.)  The\nNinth Circuit again reversed, holding that the flyer sent by HACLA did not provide sufficient notice of\nthe VPS change.  The court found that this “failure violated both the requirements of the Voucher\nProgram regulations and the requirements of procedural due process,” as well as state law.  Nozzi II, 806\nF.3d at 1204.  The matter was remanded “with instructions for the district court to enter summary\njudgment in favor of the plaintiffs on the merits of the federal and state law claims at issue on this\nappeal.”  Id.  \nFollowing remand, this Court certified two classes: (1) the Rule 23(b)(2) “Injunctive Relief\nClass” and (2) the Rule 23(b)(3) “Damages Class.”  (Docket No. 245.)  The Injunctive Relief Class\nconsists of all Section 8 beneficiaries whose benefits are administered by HACLA and who in the past\nreceived, or in the future may receive, notices of a VPS decrease.  (Id.)  The Damages Class consists of\nall HACLA Section 8 tenants, between June 1, 2005, and September 30, 2006, whose rental contribution\nfor a period not to exceed eleven months was greater than it would have been but for HACLA’s 2004\ndecrease in the VPS.  (Id.)  All Damages Class Members are also members of the Injunctive Relief\nClass.  (Docket No. 297, Ex. A (“Settlement Agreement”) ¶ 7.)  The Damages Class consists of 11,870\ntenants on the Damages Class Member List, and their principal damages amount to $10,308,774.  (See\nid. ¶¶ 9, 10; Docket No. 297, Ex. D ¶ 3.)  \nIn February 2017, the parties filed cross-motions for partial summary judgment as to remedies. \n(Docket Nos. 250, 256.)  Before the Court ruled on those motions, the parties filed a Stipulation for\nSettlement.  (Docket No. 286.)  On June 19, 2017, Plaintiffs filed an unopposed Motion for Preliminary\nApproval of Class Action Settlement.  (Docket No. 296.)  On July 29, 2017, the Court preliminarily\napproved the Settlement Agreement, as well as the appointment of JND Legal Administration (“JND”)\nas Class Administrator, and Barrett S. Litt, Anne Richardson, and Stephanie Carroll as Class Counsel. \n(Docket No. 305 (“Prelim. Approval Order”).)  \nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 2 of 12\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 331   Filed 02/15/18   Page 3 of 12   Page ID #:5962\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-380 PA (FFMx) Date February 15, 2018\nTitle Michael Nozzi, et al. v. Housing Authority for the City of Los Angeles, et al.\nPlaintiffs now move for final approval of the Settlement Agreement.  In addition, Plaintiffs seek\napproval of attorneys’ fees, litigation costs, settlement administration costs, and incentive awards.\nII. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\nThe Settlement Agreement was reached after ten years of litigation, two appeals, and two days of\nmediation before a retired federal judge. (See Settlement Agreement pp. 2–3.)  The parties ultimately\nagreed that HACLA’s insurers would pay a total of between $9 million and $9.4 million toward the\n“Class Fund” to settle all monetary claims of the Damages Class Members.  (Id. at ¶ 6.)  Under the\nSettlement Agreement, and as further explained in the motion for preliminary approval, the following\nexpenses would be deducted from the Class Fund: attorneys’ fees of less than 30% of the Class Fund;\nlitigation costs of approximately $220,000; expenses of approximately between $48,000 and $68,000\nincurred by the Class Administrator, and publication expenses of approximately $10,000 to $12,000;\nPelaez’s incentive award of $5,000; and Nozzi’s incentive award of $1,000.  (Id. at ¶¶ 4, 22, 49, 52; Mot.\nfor Prelim. Approval at 9; Docket No. 297, Ex. E (“JND Proposal”).)  The residual amount of\napproximately $6 million (the “Residual Class Fund”) would be available for Damages Class Member\nclaims.  (See Settlement Agreement ¶ 35.)  The final Damages Class Member List was to be prepared by\nPlaintiffs’ expert Kriegler based on information supplied by HACLA and HUD.  (Id. at ¶¶ 9, 12.)\nThe Settlement Agreement required the Damages Class Members to file claims to qualify for and\nreceive damages.  (Id. at ¶ 35.)  Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, a Damages Class Member would\nbe compensated up to the amount of additional rent that he or she paid as a result of the reduced HACLA\nsubsidy, depending on the number of claimants.  (Id. at ¶ 19.)  If more claims were made than could be\nfully compensated by the Residual Class Fund, claimants would receive proportional reductions in their\nreimbursements.  (Id. at ¶ 32.)  If more than $2 million, but less than the Residual Class Fund, was\nclaimed, the remainder would revert to Defendants’ insurers.  (Id. at ¶ 33.)  If less than $2 million in\nclaims were made, the difference between $2 million and the claims made would be donated to a cy pres\norganization.  (Id.)  In addition, if Damages Class Members made claims, but do not cash their checks,\nthe parties agreed that the Class Administrator would make efforts to reach them and assist them to do\nso; the funds from checks not cashed within one year of issuance would go to agreed upon cy pres\norganizations.  (Id.)\nThe Settlement Agreement further provided that HACLA would treat any payment to Damages\nClass Members who are current recipients of Section 8 in accordance with HUD regulation 24 C.F.R.\n§ 5.609(c)(3), i.e., as a settlement for personal injury.  (Id. at ¶ 34.)  Furthermore, HACLA would\ndesignate a person whom Damages Class Members could contact with questions about the impact of\nreceipt of settlement funds on their Section 8 benefits.  (Id.)\nThe parties also agreed upon a three-year injunction.  Pursuant to the injunction provisions,\nHACLA, when issuing notices related to reduction of the VPS, must “simply and plainly communicate\nthe information provided in non-technical, [sic] language that would be reasonably understandable to\nSection 8 tenants, at a language level commensurate with the average educational level of Section 8\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 3 of 12\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 331   Filed 02/15/18   Page 4 of 12   Page ID #:5963\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-380 PA (FFMx) Date February 15, 2018\nTitle Michael Nozzi, et al. v. Housing Authority for the City of Los Angeles, et al.\ntenants.  The notice shall reasonably explain the known, likely or potential impact on the tenant of the\naction that is the subject of the notice.”  (Id. at ¶ 71(a).)  Furthermore, any such notice involving\nreduction of the VPS “shall be provided to Class [C]ounsel before it is sent [to Section 8 tenants], and\nshall be subject to approval of Class Counsel before it is communicated to Section 8 tenants, which\napproval shall not be unreasonably withheld.”  (Id. at ¶ 71(b).)  Finally, HACLA is required to “use\nlanguage reasonably understandable to Section 8 tenants” when communicating any new notices to\ntenants, other than a notice of reduction of the VPS, which are addressed by ¶ 71(a) of the Settlement\nAgreement.  (Id. at ¶ 71(c).) \nIn return for the injunction and damages, Class Members agree to release Defendants from “all\nclaims . . . involving violations of law or constitutional rights, including, without limitation, their due\nprocess rights under federal and California Constitutions and law, their rights under California Civil\nCode § 815.6 and for negligence, any other rights under any other federal, state or local law, regulation,\nduty, or obligation, or any other legal theory, action or cause of action, which are based upon or could be\nbased upon or arise from the facts alleged in the lawsuit (hereafter ‘Covered Claims’).”  (Id. at ¶ 42.) \nClass Members, including the Named Plaintiffs, “waive all rights to any and all claims relating to\ndamages or reimbursement of any kind for the Covered Claims.”  (Id. at ¶ 43.)  They further “waive any\nand all rights to pursue, initiate, prosecute, or commence any action or proceeding before any court,\nadministrative agency or other tribunal, or to file any complaint regarding acts or omissions by the\nReleased Persons with respect to the Covered Claims during the Class Period that fit within the\ndefinition of the Damages Class; and further, as it relates to this waiver or Release, expressly waive the\nprovisions of California Civil Code § 1542.”  (Id. at ¶ 44).  Those who suffered damages but were\nomitted from the Damages Class Member List would not be bound by the Settlement Agreement as to\nclaims for damages, and would be permitted to bring such claims against Defendants.  (Id. at ¶ 10 n.1.) \nFinally, Damages Class Members could opt out or object if they were not satisfied with the settlement\namount or other aspects of the Settlement Agreement.  (Id. at ¶¶ 66–70.) \nIII. FINAL APPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT\nA. Fairness of the Class Settlement\nRule 23(e) requires a district court to determine whether a proposed class action settlement is\n“fundamentally fair, adequate, and reasonable.”  Staton v. Boeing Co., 327 F.3d 938, 959 (9th Cir.\n2003).  To make this determination, courts consider a number of factors, including: (1) the strength of\nthe plaintiff’s case; (2) the risk, expense, complexity, and likely duration of further litigation; (3) the risk\nof maintaining class action status throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered in settlement; (5) the extent\nof discovery completed, and the stage of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views of counsel;\n(7) the presence of a governmental participant; and (8) the reaction of the class members to the \nproposed settlement.  See id.  Also, the settlement may not be the product of collusion among the\nnegotiating parties.  In re Mego Fin. Corp. Sec. Litig., 213 F.3d 454, 458 (9th Cir. 2000).  The Ninth\nCircuit has declared that a strong judicial policy favors settlement of class actions.

The Strength of Plaintiffs’ Case and the Risk, Expense, Complexity, and Likely\nDuration of Further Litigation\n“When evaluating the strength of a case, the Court should evaluate objectively the strengths and\nweaknesses inherent in the litigation and the impact of those considerations on the parties’ decisions to\nreach these agreements.”  De Santos v. Jaco Oil Co., No. 1:14-cv-0738-JLT, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n93410, at *16 (E.D. Cal. July 17, 2015).  Here, prior to settlement, the parties had already litigated for\nmore than 10 years, and endured two appeals, which ultimately resolved the issue of liability.  However,\nwhether, and to what extent, damages were available remained unresolved and cross-motions for\nsummary judgment on that issue remained pending at the time of settlement.  There remained a\nlikelihood that the Court’s ruling on those motions would have been appealed.  (See Final Approval\nMot. 7, 9.)  In addition, failure to settle at this point would have further delayed relief for Class Members\nwho, by definition, are (or at least were during the class period) low-income.  These factors favor\ngranting final approval of the Settlement Agreement.\n2. The Amount Offered in the Settlement Agreement\nThe Class Fund amount is $9,339,256.47.2/  The Motions for Final Approval and Attorneys’ Fees\nseek (1) an attorneys’ fee award of $2,801,776.94; (2) reimbursement of litigation expenses of\n$169,699.88; (3) incentive payments to Pelaez and Nozzi of $5,000 and $1,000, respectively; and\n(4) costs for settlement administration, totaling $60,000.  Thus, the Residual Class Fund of\napproximately $6.3 million was available for claims by Damages Class Members.  The Residual Class\nFund was sufficient for up to approximately 58% of claims of Damages Class Members to be\ncompensated in full.  In fact, approximately 19.38% of Damages Class Members filed claims that have\nbeen approved, and thus each of those claimants will be paid in full for the decrease in rent subsidy,\nwithout interest.  Claimed damages total approximately $2,160,078.45.3/  (Keough Decl. ¶ 22.)\n2/ The Settlement Agreement provided for a Class Fund that was between $9 million and $9.4\nmillion, dependent upon defense fees.  (Settlement Agreement ¶ 6.)  The parties have concluded, after\nsubtracting total defense fees, that $9,339,256.47 is the total available Class Fund.  (Final Approval Mot.\n2; Litt Decl. ISO Final Approval Mot. ¶ 5.)\n3/ While the Motion for Final Approval states that the value of all valid claims was $2,218,075.26\nas of December 6, 2017, the initial declaration of the Class Administrator attests that the damages for all\nvalid claims amounted to $2,160,078.45 as of December 20, 2017.  (Compare Final Approval Mot. 3,\nwith Litt Decl. ISO Final Approval Mot., Ex. 7 (“Keough Decl.”) ¶ 22.)  However, the Class\nAdministrator has updated the number of valid claims from 2,269 in her initial declaration to 2,300 in a\n(continued...)\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 5 of 12\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 331   Filed 02/15/18   Page 6 of 12   Page ID #:5965\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-380 PA (FFMx) Date February 15, 2018\nTitle Michael Nozzi, et al. v. Housing Authority for the City of Los Angeles, et al.\nGiven the increased expense and risk that would accompany continued litigation and the\npresence of the opt-out provision, the Court finds that the total settlement amount is reasonable and\nfavors approval of the Settlement Agreement. \n3. The Extent of Discovery Completed and the Stage of the Proceedings\nLitigation in this action has been extensive and discovery was complete at the time of settlement. \nFurthermore, Plaintiffs hired an expert who performed extensive analysis of records held by HACLA\nand HUD to determine damages.  The parties also engaged in two days of formal mediation before a\nthird-party neutral.  This extensive case history weighs in favor of approval of the Settlement\nAgreement.\n4. The Experience and Views of Counsel\nThe Court finds that Class Counsel has sufficient experience with class action litigation to\nappropriately assess the legal and factual issues in this matter and determine whether the Settlement\nAgreement serves the interests of the Class Members.  Thus, Class Counsel’s belief that the Settlement\nAgreement is both fair and adequate weighs in favor of approval. \n5. Collusion Between the Parties\nTo determine whether there has been any collusion between the parties, a court must evaluate\nwhether “fees and relief provisions clearly suggest the possibility that class interests gave way to self\ninterests,” thereby raising the possibility that the settlement is the result of misconduct by the negotiators\nor improper incentives for certain class members.  Staton, 327 F.3d at 961.  Here, it appears that the\nSettlement Agreement was the product of informed, arm’s-length negotiations between the parties.  The\nreasonableness of the amount offered in settlement, the extensive litigation history, and the involvement\nof a third-party neutral further suggest an absence of collusion.  Furthermore, the fees and incentive\nawards sought do not suggest collusion, particularly as any such award was conditioned upon approval\nof the Court.  (See Settlement Agreement ¶¶ 49, 52); see also Rodriguez v. W. Publ’g Corp., 563 F.3d\n948, 968 (9th Cir. 2009) (finding conflicts of interest where incentive agreements existed between\nnamed plaintiffs and counsel).  The Court finds that the Settlement Agreement is the product of non-\ncollusive negotiations.  \n3/(...continued)\nsupplemental declaration, but has not updated the dollar value of approved claims.  (Compare Keough\nDecl. ¶ 22, with Docket No. 330-1 (“Keough Suppl. Decl.”) ¶ 12.a.)  While this change in number of\nvalid claims renders it likely that the $2,160,078.45 figure is low, for purposes of this Order, the Court\nassumes it is a reasonable approximation of the value of the valid and approved claims. \nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 6 of 12\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 331   Filed 02/15/18   Page 7 of 12   Page ID #:5966\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-380 PA (FFMx) Date February 15, 2018\nTitle Michael Nozzi, et al. v. Housing Authority for the City of Los Angeles, et al.\n6. Presence of Governmental Participant\nPursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1715, Defendants notified the Attorney\nGeneral of the United States and the CAFA Coordinators of the California Office of the Attorney\nGeneral of the Settlement Agreement.  (See Docket No. 303.)  “Although CAFA does not create an\naffirmative duty for either state or federal officials to take any action in response to a class action\nsettlement, CAFA presumes that, once put on notice, state or federal officials will raise any concerns that\nthey may have during the normal course of the class action settlement procedures.”  Garner v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., Case No. CV 08-1365 CW (EMC), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49477, at *14 (N.D. Cal.\nApr. 22, 2010).  No government official has objected to the terms of the Settlement Agreement. \nAccordingly, this factor weighs in favor of final approval.  See Noll v. eBay, Inc., 309 F.R.D. 593, 608\n(N.D. Cal. 2015); Holman v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc., Case No. 11-cv-0180 CW (DMR), 2014 U.S.\nDist. LEXIS 173698, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 12, 2014).\n7. Reaction of Class Members to Settlement\nWhere a settlement agreement enjoys overwhelming support from the class, this lends weight to\na finding that the settlement agreement is fair, adequate, and reasonable.  Nat’l Rural Telecomms. Coop.\nv. DIRECTV, Inc., 221 F.R.D. 523, 529 (C.D. Cal. 2004) (“It is established that the absence of a large\nnumber of objections to a proposed class action settlement raises a strong presumption that the terms of\na proposed class settlement action are favorable to the class members.”); see also Boyd v. Bechtel Corp.,\n485 F. Supp. 610, 624 (N.D. Cal. 1979) (finding that objections from only 16 percent of the class was\npersuasive that the settlement was adequate).  Class Members were provided notice of the Settlement\nAgreement pursuant to this Court’s order granting the motion for preliminary approval.  (See infra Part\nIII.B.)\nAccording to the Class Administrator, there were 2,300 valid and approved claims out of 11,870\nDamages Class Members, amounting to 19.38% participation of the Damages Class.  (See Keough\nSuppl. Decl. ¶ 12.a.)  Thirty-one additional Class Members filed claims that lacked signatures or were\notherwise deficient, and were not timely cured.4/  (Id. at ¶ 12.c.)  Twenty-seven claim forms were\nsubmitted by eligible Class Members but postmarked after the filing deadline of December 6, 2017.5/ \n4/ Additionally, 556 claim forms were submitted by individuals who did not appear on the Damages\nClass List and 65 claim forms were duplicates of earlier-submitted claims forms.  (Id. at ¶¶ 12.d, 12.e.) \nThese claims were denied.  (Id. at ¶¶ 12.d, 12.e.)\n5/ At the final fairness hearing, counsel indicated that the parties were still deciding whether to\naccept these claims despite their untimeliness.  Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties, claim forms\nnot received or postmarked by December 6, 2017, shall not be paid, although those claimants shall\nnonetheless be bound by this Order and the Judgment.\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 7 of 12\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 331   Filed 02/15/18   Page 8 of 12   Page ID #:5967\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-380 PA (FFMx) Date February 15, 2018\nTitle Michael Nozzi, et al. v. Housing Authority for the City of Los Angeles, et al.\n(Id. at ¶ 12.b.)  No Class Member objected to the Settlement Agreement6/ and 8 Class Members opted\nout.  (Keough Decl. ¶¶ 15, 18.)  The Administrator attempted to mail notices to all Class Members, and\nafter skip-tracing, ultimately 11,056 such notices were mailed and not returned as undeliverable.  (Id. at\n¶ 7.)\nThe settlement website created by JND tracked 13,285 unique users who registered 24,595 page\nviews and 1,103 case document views.  (Id. at ¶ 8.)  The toll-free number established by JND received\nmore than 1,775 calls (id. at ¶ 11), and JND associates spoke with 737 such callers (Keough Suppl. Decl.\n¶ 8).  The overall positive reaction of Class Members and lack of objections is strong evidence that the\nSettlement Agreement is fundamentally fair and reasonable.\nB. Adequacy of Notice to the Settlement Class\nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e), this Court must “direct notice in a reasonable\nmanner to all class members who would be bound by the proposal.”  Such notice must be “‘reasonably\ncalculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and\nafford them an opportunity to present their objections.’”  Klee v. Nissan N. Am., Inc., No. CV 12-08238\nAWT (PJWx), 2015 WL 4538426, at *5 (C.D. Cal. July 7, 2015).  The notice given in this case was\nreasonably calculated to reach the Damages Class.  The notices described the essential terms of the\nSettlement Agreement, defined the classes, set forth the procedure for Damages Class Members to make\nclaims, opt out, or file objections to the Settlement Agreement, and provided information on the date,\ntime, and location of the Final Fairness Hearing.  (Docket No. 297, Ex. C; Keough Decl. ¶ 5.)  They\nfurther provided a toll-free number for Class Members to call and a website containing essential case\ndocuments.  (Keough Decl. ¶¶ 8, 10.)  In addition, notices were posted at HACLA offices where Section\n8 tenants may have occasion to visit.  (See Docket No. 325, Mendoza Decl. ¶¶ 2–3.)  Finally, a notice\nwas published in the L.A. Times for three consecutive weeks on August 18, 2017, August 25, 2017, and\nSeptember 1, 2017, and a 30-day internet advertising campaign was launched on Facebook, Instagram,\nand Twitter to inform Class Members about the settlement.  (Keough Decl. ¶ 12.)  The Court therefore\nconcludes that the notice procedures satisfied the requirements of Due Process and Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 23(e).\nIV. ATTORNEYS’ FEES, LITIGATION EXPENSES, INCENTIVE AWARDS, AND\nADMINISTRATION EXPENSES\nA. Attorneys’ Fees\nThe Court is obligated to conduct a careful review of the reasonableness of requested attorneys’\nfees and costs.  See In re Wash. Pub. Power Supply Sys. Sec. Litig., 19 F.3d 1291, 1302 (9th Cir. 1994)\n6/ One objection was received, but that Class Member later withdrew his objection, which involved\nmatters distinct from the instant action or the Settlement Agreement.  (See Docket Nos. 318, 319, 320;\nsee also Litt Decl. ISO Final Approval Mot., Ex. 2.)\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 8 of 12\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 331   Filed 02/15/18   Page 9 of 12   Page ID #:5968\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-380 PA (FFMx) Date February 15, 2018\nTitle Michael Nozzi, et al. v. Housing Authority for the City of Los Angeles, et al.\n(“Because in common fund cases the relationship between plaintiffs and their attorneys turns adversarial\nat the fee-setting stage, courts have stressed that when awarding attorneys’ fees from a common fund,\nthe district court must assume the role of fiduciary for the class plaintiffs.”).  Plaintiffs seek\n$2,801,776.94 in attorneys’ fees.  (Final Approval Mot. 19.)  This constitutes 30% of the Class Fund\ncreated by the Settlement Agreement.  In common fund cases, “where the settlement or award creates a\nlarge fund for distribution to the class, the district court has discretion to use either a percentage or\nlodestar method.”  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1029 (9th Cir. 1998).  “The percentage\nmethod means that the court simply awards the attorneys a percentage of the fund sufficient to provide\nclass counsel with a reasonable fee.”  Id.  The Ninth Circuit has established 25% of the common fund\n“as a benchmark award for attorney fees.”  Id. \nClass Counsel cites numerous cases in district courts and other circuits that have found up to\n33% to be a reasonable fee in class action settlement.  (See Attorneys’ Fees Mot. 13–14 & n.2.) \nFurthermore, the Ninth Circuit has concluded that “[t]he 25% benchmark rate, although a starting point\nfor analysis, may be inappropriate in some cases.  Selection of the benchmark or any other rate must be\nsupported by findings that take into account all of the circumstances of the case.”  Vizcaino v. Microsoft\nCorp., 290 F.3d 1043, 1048 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that district court did not abuse its discretion in\nawarding 28% of common fund as attorneys’ fees).  Class Counsel argues that in light of the risk\ninvolved; complexity of issues; Class Counsel’s experience, skill, and effort expended; and results\nobtained, 30% of the Class Fund is a reasonable fee in this case.  (Attorneys’ Fees Mot. 3–9.) \n“The lodestar method can ‘confirm that a percentage of recovery amount does not award counsel\nan exorbitant hourly rate . . . .’”  In re Bluetooth Headset Prods. Liab. Litig., 654 F.3d 935, 945 (9th Cir.\n2011) (quoting In re GMC Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank Prods. Liab. Litig., 55 F.3d 768, 820 (3d Cir.\n1995)).  Here, according to Class Counsel’s professed rates and hours worked, the lodestar calculation\nwould be approximately $3.3 million.  (See Final Approval Mot. 17.)  The Class was represented by two\nfirms:  Kaye, McLane, Bednarski, and Litt and Public Counsel.  Between the two firms, ten attorneys\nhave spent 3,735.7 hours working on this case since its inception more than a decade ago.  (Litt Decl.\nISO Final Approval Mot. ¶ 10; Richardson Decl. ISO Final Approval Mot. ¶ 8.)7/  Each of these\nattorneys has a rate of between $540 and $1150 per hour.  (Litt Decl. ISO Final Approval Mot. ¶ 10;\nRichardson Decl. ISO Final Approval Mot. ¶ 8.)  A litigation coordinator and three paralegals have rates\nof between $150 and $335 and have committed a total of 685.9 hours to this case, while three law clerks,\nbilling at $200 per hour, spent 96.8 hours on this case.  (Litt Decl. ISO Final Approval Mot. ¶ 10;\nRichardson Decl. ISO Final Approval Mot. ¶ 8.)\n  \n7/ The Court notes disparity between the hours and rates for Public Counsel provided by Mr. Litt in\nhis Declaration in support of the Motion for Final Approval, and those provided by Ms. Richardson in\nher Declaration.  (Compare Litt Decl. ISO Final Approval Mot. ¶ 10, with Richardson Decl. ISO Final\nApproval Mot. ¶ 8.)  At the Final Fairness Hearing, Class Counsel acknowledged that Ms. Richardson’s\nDeclaration should be relied upon for such hours and rates where contradictions between the\ndeclarations exist.\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 9 of 12\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 331   Filed 02/15/18   Page 10 of 12   Page ID #:5969\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-380 PA (FFMx) Date February 15, 2018\nTitle Michael Nozzi, et al. v. Housing Authority for the City of Los Angeles, et al.\nConsidering the results achieved, the time expended, the risks faced in this litigation, the skill\nrequired, the quality of work, the contingent nature of the fee, the financial burden carried by Class\nCounsel, and awards made in similar cases, as well as the lack of Class Member objection to this fee\naward, the Court finds that the requested attorneys’ fee award is reasonable.  The Court therefore grants\nPlaintiffs’ request for $2,801,776.94 in attorneys’ fees to be awarded from the Class Fund.\nB. Litigation Costs\nPlaintiffs request $169,699.88 in litigation costs.  “Reasonable costs and expenses incurred by an\nattorney who creates or preserves a common fund are reimbursed proportionately by those class\nmembers who benefit by the settlement.”  In re Media Vision Tech. Sec. Litig., 913 F. Supp. 1362, 1366\n(N.D. Cal. 1996).  However, expenses that should be considered part of an attorney’s overhead, and\ntherefore included within an award of attorneys’ fees, should not be characterized as a litigation expense\nand recovered as a cost item.  Id. (“An award of out-of-pocket expenses should be limited to those\nexpenses customarily billed to a fee-paying client.”) These costs are itemized in detail in the supporting\ndeclarations.  (See Litt Decl. ISO Final Approval Mot. Ex. 6; Litt Decl. ISO Attorneys’ Fees Mot., Ex.\nD.)  The most expensive items include expert fees of $118,430.50, mediation costs of $18,000, and\nonline research costs of $17,094.02.  The Settlement Agreement further identifies the types of costs for\nwhich Defendants agreed to reimburse Class Counsel, and the Preliminary Approval Order noted that\nlitigation costs of up to $220,000 could be awarded.  (See Settlement Agreement ¶¶ 5, 52; Prelim.\nApproval Order at 3.)  No Class Member objected.  The Court concludes that with the exception of the\nonline research costs of $17,094.02 which the Court determines is part of an attorney’s overhead, the\nrequested litigation costs are reasonable.  Accordingly, the Court awards $152,605.86 in litigation costs.  \nC.  Named Plaintiffs’ Incentive Awards\nPlaintiffs also seek incentive awards of $5,000 for Pelaez in addition to her damages award, and\nof $1,000 for Nozzi inclusive of his damages.  (Final Approval Mot. 13.)  Courts may consider the\nfollowing criteria to determine whether to make an incentive award: (1) the risk to the class\nrepresentative in commencing suit, both financial and otherwise; (2) the notoriety and personal\ndifficulties encountered by the class representative; (3) the amount of time and effort spent by the class\nrepresentative; (4) the duration of the litigation; and (5) the personal benefit enjoyed by the class\nrepresentative as a result of the litigation.  Van Vraken v. Atl. Richfield Co., 901 F. Supp. 294, 299\n(N.D. Cal. 1995); see also Rodriguez, 563 F.3d at 959 (agreeing with district court that incentive award\nshould be tied to work performed, risks undertaken, and time spent on litigation).  Courts also consider\n“the number of named plaintiffs receiving incentive payments, the proportion of the payments relative to\nthe settlement amount, and the size of each payment.”  Staton, 327 F.3d at 975; see, e.g., In re Online\nDVD-Rental Antitrust Litig., 779 F.3d 934, 943 (9th Cir. 2015) (holding that incentive award to class\nrepresentative was permissible where “[t]he amount sought and awarded was relatively small, well\nwithin the usual norms of ‘modest compensation’ paid to class representatives for services performed in\nthe class action”); Friedman v. Guthy-Renker, LLC, No. 2:14-cv-06009-ODW(AGRx), 2016 WL\n6407362, at *8 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 28, 2016) (balancing the above considerations and concluding that “while\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 10 of 12\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 331   Filed 02/15/18   Page 11 of 12   Page ID #:5970\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-380 PA (FFMx) Date February 15, 2018\nTitle Michael Nozzi, et al. v. Housing Authority for the City of Los Angeles, et al.\n[two of the named plaintiffs’] awards come close to the threshold of disapproval, the Court finds that\ntheir participation in this lawsuit—including responding to substantial discovery and sitting for a\ndeposition—justifies the award.” (citation omitted)); Cox v. Clarus Mktg. Grp., LLC, 291 F.R.D. 473,\n483 (S.D. Cal. 2013). \nIn its order preliminarily approving of the Settlement Agreement, the Court explicitly warned\nthat final approval of an incentive award would require a more significant showing.  (See Prelim.\nApproval Order at 6.)  Despite this warning, Plaintiffs have provided little additional factual basis to\nsupport the requested incentive awards.  Plaintiffs assert that Nozzi initiated this action and without him\nthere may have been no case.  (Final Approval Mot. 13.)  Meanwhile, Pelaez served as Class\nRepresentative and was available for a deposition if necessary, participated in interviews with Class\nCounsel, and provided declarations.  (Id.; Litt Decl. ISO Final Approval Mot. ¶ 2.)\nSuch assertions do not support the awards sought by Plaintiffs.  However, the Court finds an\naward of $2,500 to Pelaez, in addition to her damages award, and $500 to Nozzi, inclusive of his\ndamages, to be reasonable in light of their participation, and thus, grants awards to Named Plaintiffs in\nthose amounts. \nD. Settlement Administration Award\nFinally, Plaintiffs seek approval of settlement administration costs.  The Class Administrator has\nbilled $24,000 and anticipates billing another $24,000 for administration fees.  (Keough Suppl. Decl.\n¶ 13.)  Furthermore, the Class Administrator seeks $12,000 in costs for publication – $6,000 for costs\nassociated with publication in the L.A. Times, and $6,000 for the internet campaign.  (Id. at ¶ 11.) \nPlaintiffs previously filed JND’s bid, in which JND estimated a total cost of $48,000 in the event of a\n25% claims rate, and noted it could reach $68,000 if more claims were filed.  (See Settlement\nAgreement, Ex. E.)  Here, including claims that have been rejected, the Class Administrator has\nprocessed 2,979 claims, representing a 25.1% claims rate.  (Keough Suppl. Decl. ¶ 12.)  In its bid, JND\nidentified the services it expected to provide depending on the number of claimants.  Since then, the\nCEO of JND has provided declarations in which she attests to the services JND has provided, and will\nprovide in this case.  (Keough Decl.; Keough Suppl. Decl.)  In addition, the parties previously sought,\nand the Court considered, publication costs of between $10,000 and $12,000, in preliminarily approving\nthe Settlement Agreement.  (See Mot. for Prelim. Approval at 9; Prelim. Approval Order at 3.)  No class\nmember has objected to such awards of administration or publication costs.  Based on the evidence\nprovided and the lack of objections, the Court finds that up to $60,000 total to be reasonable\nadministration and publication costs in this case, and authorizes payment of such costs to JND from the\nClass Fund.\nFurthermore, as requested in the Proposed Order, the Class Administrator will prepare a list of all\nrejected claims, with the reasons for rejection, and maintain the list in its case file.  The Class\nAdministrator shall preserve all written communications from Class Members in response to the Class\nfor at least three years.  All written communications received by the Class Administrator from Class\nCV-90 (06/04) CIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL Page 11 of 12\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 331   Filed 02/15/18   Page 12 of 12   Page ID #:5971\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nCENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\nCIVIL MINUTES - GENERAL\nCase No. CV 07-380 PA (FFMx) Date February 15, 2018\nTitle Michael Nozzi, et al. v.

At the conclusion of the Class Distribution, the Class\nAdministrator shall submit a report to the Court summarizing the payments made to the Class. \nConclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Settlement Agreement is fundamentally fair,\nadequate, and reasonable.  The Court therefore grants Plaintiffs’ Motion for Final Approval of\nSettlement.  Injunctive Relief Class Members and Damages Class Members release those claims against\nDefendants as set forth in the Settlement Agreement, except as to monetary damages for those Damages\nClass Members who timely opted out.  The Court reaffirms its approval of Barrett S. Litt, Anne\nRichardson, and Stephanie Carroll as Class Counsel and JND as Class Administrator.\nThe Court also grants in part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees and awards\n$2,801,776.94 in fees and $152,605.86 in costs to Class Counsel to be paid by Defendants. \nAdditionally, the Court grants $2,500 to Pelaez as an incentive award and $500 to Nozzi as an incentive\naward.  Furthermore, JND’s costs of up to $60,000 are approved.  Each of these awards and costs are to\nbe paid from the Class Fund.\nThe Court orders Defendants to provide the Class Fund to the Class Administrator for\ndisbursement in accordance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement.  The Court further orders the\nClass Administrator to pay all members of the Damages Class who have filed valid claims in accordance\nwith the terms of the Settlement Agreement.  The Court will enter a Judgment consistent with this Order\nand the Settlement Agreement.  The effective date of settlement is 30 days after the date the Judgment is\nentered on the Docket.

HACLA\nOPINION\nREINHARDT, Circuit Judge:\nThe Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program provides\nrental assistance to the most vulnerable members of our\nsociety.  For many, especially those in areas with a high cost\nof living, the continuous receipt of these benefits is the only\nmeans  through  which  Section  8  beneficiaries  and  their\nfamilies can obtain safe, affordable housing.  For those on a\nfixed income or those living paycheck to paycheck, any\nunexpected  decrease  in  the  subsidy  can  result  in\nhomelessness.    For  this  reason,  the  program  contains\nprocedural protections designed to ensure that beneficiaries\nhave at least a full year to plan for certain changes that may\ndecrease the beneficiary’s subsidy and increase the rent that\nthey will have to pay.\n Plaintiffs are the putative class representatives of a group\nof tenants who receive rent subsidies through the Section 8\nHousing Choice Voucher Program.  They assert that the\nDefendants, the local administrators of the Voucher Program,\nreduced the amount of Section 8 beneficiaries’ subsidies\nwithout providing adequate notice, in violation of federal and\nstate law.  We agree.  Accordingly, we reverse the grant of\nsummary judgment in favor of the defendants, direct that\nsummary judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiffs, and\nremand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 5 of 48   Page ID #:1923\nNOZZI V. HACLA 5\nI.  STATUTORY AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND\nA. Overview of the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher\nProgram\nIn 1974, Congress created the Section 8 housing program\nin order to “aid[] low-income families in obtaining a decent\nplace to live” and “promot[e] economically mixed housing.” \nHousing and Community Development Act of 1974, Pub. L.\n93-383 § 201(a), 88 Stat. 633, 622–66 (1974) (codified as\namended at 42 U.S.C. § 1437f).  For over four decades, the\nprogram  has  provided  rental  assistance  to  low-income,\nelderly, and disabled families.  See generally Park Village\nApartment  Tenants  Ass’n  v.  Mortimer  Howard  Trust,\n636 F.3d 1150, 1152 (9th Cir. 2011).\nThe majority of federal housing assistance takes place\nthrough  the  Housing  Choice  Voucher  Program,  which\nsubsidizes the cost of renting privately-owned housing units. \n42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o).  The Voucher Program is funded and\nregulated by the federal Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment, and it is administered at the local level through\n“public housing agencies.”  24 C.F.R. § 982.1(a).\nThe  public  housing  agencies  determine  whether\nindividuals  are  eligible  to  participate  in  the  program. \n24 C.F.R. § 982.201.  When an individual is approved, the\npublic housing agency gives that person a voucher which\nentitles him to search for qualifying privately-owned housing. \n24 C.F.R. § 982.302.  When a voucher-possessing individual\nfinds a qualifying unit, the unit owner and public housing\nagency will negotiate and enter into a housing assistance\npayment contract, which inter alia specifies the maximum\nmonthly rent that the unit owner may charge.  42 U.S.C.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 6 of 48   Page ID #:1924\n6 NOZZI V. HACLA\n§ 1437f(c).  After that contract has been formed, the public\nhousing  agency will make subsidy payments to the unit\nowner on behalf of the tenant.1\nAn extensive set of statutory provisions and regulations\ngoverns the calculation of the subsidy that must be paid on\nbehalf of each tenant.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o); 24 C.F.R.\n§ 982.501 et seq.  To begin with, the Department of Housing\nand Urban Development must set the fair market rent for\nestablished  geographic  areas  across  the  United  States. \n24 C.F.R. § 982.503(a)(1).  The public housing agency must\nuse this fair market rent to create a local voucher “payment\nstandard” for each of the areas in its jurisdiction.  24 C.F.R.\n§ 982.503(b)(1)(I).  A payment standard is the maximum\nsubsidy payment that the housing agency will provide for\neach type of apartment in the area.  Id.  It must generally be\nset between 90 percent and 110 percent of the fair market rent\nfor the area.  24 C.F.R. § 982.503(b)(1)(i).2\nAll tenants are responsible for contributing 30% of their\nmonthly adjusted income or 10% of their gross monthly\n   1 As the “beneficiaries” at issue in this opinion are those Section 8\nrecipients who have already secured and are currently leasing apartments\nthat are paid for, in part, by Section 8 subsidies, the terms “beneficiary”\nand “tenant” are used interchangeably throughout the opinion.\n   2 The public housing agency must request approval to establish a\npayment standard outside of this range.  24 C.F.R. § 982.503(b)(2).  The\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development may approve such a\nvariance if the public housing agency meets one of the prescribed\nexceptions.  See 24 C.F.R. § 982.503(c)–(d).\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 7 of 48   Page ID #:1925\nNOZZI V. HACLA 7\nincome, whichever is greater.  42 U.S.C. § 1437f(c)(2)(A).3 \nTenants  whose rental units  cost more than the payment\nstandard have a higher expected contribution.  Such tenants\nmust also pay any amount by which their rent exceeds the\nestablished payment standard.  42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(2)(B).4 \nIn either case, the subsidy covers the balance of the rent.\nB.  Procedures for Decreasing the Payment Standard\nPractically,  the  formula  for  calculating  a  tenant’s\nexpected rent contribution means that a decision by the public\nhousing  agency  to  increase  the  payment  standard  will\ngenerally yield larger subsidies.  By contrast, a decrease in\nthe payment standard will generally decrease subsidies and\nmay increase the rental contribution of a substantial number\nof tenants.5\n   3 This calculation must account for any welfare assistance tenants\nreceive that is specifically designated for housing costs.  42 U.S.C.\n§ 1437f(o)(2)(A)(iii).\n   4 An example helps to illustrate this formula.  Abel and Beth both must\ncontribute 30% of their monthly adjusted income, for a total of $100 each. \nThe payment standard for one-bedroom apartments in their area is $400. \nAbel rents a $400 apartment.  He must pay $100 towards his rent and will\nreceive the remaining $300 as a rent subsidy.  Beth rents a $500\napartment.  She must pay the $100 from her monthly adjusted income, but\nmust also pay the amount by which her $500 apartment exceeds the $400\npayment standard–another $100, for a total of $200.\n   5 In the hypothetical above, if the public housing agency lowered the\npayment standard for a one-bedroom apartment in the area from $400 to\n$300, Abel, who is renting a $400 apartment, would now need to pay an\nadditional $100 for a total of $200.  Beth, who is renting a $500\napartment, would need to pay an additional $200, for a total of $300.  A\ndecrease in the payment standard would not cause an increase in rent\nwhen: (1) the total rent for the unit is less than the lower payment\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 8 of 48   Page ID #:1926\n8 NOZZI V. HACLA\nTo  avoid  any  hardship  caused  by  this  change,  the\nDepartment  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development’s\nregulations are designed to ensure that beneficiaries have a\none-year  period  of  stable  benefits  in  which  to  plan  for\nchanges to the payment standard that may adversely affect\ntheir subsidy amount and rent contribution.  Each year, the\npublic housing agency conducts annual examinations of each\nbeneficiary, usually on the anniversary of the beneficiary’s\nentry into the Section 8 program, to verify his continued\neligibility for benefits and to calculate his expected rent\ncontribution for the current year.  24 C.F.R. § 982.516. \nAlterations  to  a  tenant’s  benefits  may  occur  due  to\ncircumstantial changes, such as adjustments to the tenant’s\nincome, family composition, or cost to rent his apartment, but\nthe regulations limit the discretion of public housing agencies\nto lower subsidies based on adjustments to the payment\nstandards.  If the public housing agency decides to lower the\npayment standards, it must provide information about the\nchange to all beneficiaries at their annual reexaminations\nfollowing  the  decision,  and  must  further  advise  these\nbeneficiaries that the change will not go into effect until their\nfollowing  reexamination  one  year  later.    See  24  C.F.R.\n§ 982.505(c)(3).\n This requirement provides some measure of financial\nstability for vulnerable Section 8 beneficiaries as it protects\nagainst sudden decreases in subsidy at the whims of the\npublic  housing  agency.    Absent  any  changes  to  a\nbeneficiary’s  circumstances,  he  can  be  assured  that  his\nsubsidy will renew with, at a minimum, the same terms as the\nstandard, (2) the tenant’s adjusted income has also decreased, or (3) the\npublic housing agency later raised the payment standard before the\ndecrease went into effect.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 9 of 48   Page ID #:1927\nNOZZI V. HACLA 9\nprior year unless he had previously been warned that the\npublic  housing  agency  has  taken  an  action  that  could\nadversely  affect  his  subsidy.    The  regulations  cast  this\nwarning in terms of the public housing agency’s duty to\nprovide  information  to  the  beneficiary  that  the  payment\nstandard has been decreased, to be effective at least a year\nafterward.    Thus,  under  that  mandatory  procedure,  the\nbeneficiary necessarily has an expectation in an unaffected\none-year term of benefits following the warning in which to\nplan for the change’s potential adverse impact.\nII.  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nA. Implementation of the 2004 Payment Standard\nDecrease\nThe  Housing  Authority  of  the  City  of  Los  Angeles\n(“Housing Authority”) administers the Voucher Program for\nthat city.6  In 2004, the Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment  required  the  Housing  Authority  to  limit\nspending in order to balance the Department’s 2004 budget. \nTo meet the budget constraints, the Housing Authority’s\nBoard of Commissioners reduced the payment standard from\n110% of the 50th percentile of rents in Los Angeles County\nto 100% of the 40th percentile of rents.  At the time, the\nBoard  estimated  that  “approximately  45%  of  its\napproximately 45,000 Section 8 tenants would be adversely\naffected by the April 2004 decrease, and would have to pay\nan average of $104 more in rent each month if they chose to\nremain in their current units.  Of this number, nearly 5,000\n   6 The plaintiffs in this case also sued the Executive Director of the\nHousing Authority for the City of Los Angeles.  Throughout the opinion,\nboth defendants will be referred to as the “Housing Authority.”\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 10 of 48   Page ID #:1928\n10 NOZZI V. HACLA\nwere elderly families, and nearly 4,500 were non-elderly,\ndisabled families.”7\nThat year, the Housing Authority instructed its staff to\nattach a copy of a flyer to each Section 8 beneficiaries’\n“notice of review determination” or “RE-38,” which is a form\nsent annually to all Section 8 beneficiaries at the time of their\nannual reexamination that confirms their renewed eligibility\nfor benefits and sets forth their rent contribution and subsidy\namount for the current year.  The flyer, which was printed in\nboth English and Spanish, stated:\nHOUSING AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF LOS\nANGELES\nNOTICE\nEffective April 2, 2004 the Housing Authority\nlowered  the  payment  standards  used  to\ndetermine your portion of the rent.  We will\nnot apply these lower payment standards until\nyour  next  regular  reexamination.    If  you\nmove, however, these new lower payment\nstandards will apply to your next unit.\nThat  message  was  followed  by  (1)  a  heading  stating\n“PAYMENT  STANDARDS  AND  TENANT-BASED\nSHELTER  PLUS  CARE  PAYMENT  STANDARDS\nEFFECTIVE APRIL 2, 2004”; (2) a table listing the new\npayment standards; and (3) a statement that “Regardless of its\n   7 The Board also provided, for the first time, that every tenant must pay\na minimum expected contribution of $50.

This  particular\nnotice, which will hereinafter be referred to as the “four-week\nnotice,” set forth the tenants’ subsidies and rents for the\nupcoming year using the new, lowered payment standard. \nThis was the first time that tenants were actually notified that\nthe change would affect them personally or that there would\nbe an increase to their rent contributions.\nB. The Impacted Beneficiaries Sue\nIn  2007,  Plaintiffs  Michael Nozzi  and  Nidia  Palaez,\ntogether with the Los Angeles Coalition to End Hunger and\nHomelessness, filed an amended class action complaint on\nbehalf of affected Section 8 beneficiaries against the Housing\nAuthority and its Executive Director.9  They claimed that, as\n   8 See Appendix A.\n   9 Plaintiff Los Angeles Coalition to End Hunger and Homelessness is a\nnon-profit devoted to fighting the causes and effects of homelessness.  It\nadvocates  for  more  affordable  housing  on  behalf  of  low-income\nindividuals in Los Angeles.  Its membership includes people who receive\nSection 8 benefits and who have been negatively affected by the 2004\ndecrease in the payment standard.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 12 of 48   Page ID #:1930\n12 NOZZI V. HACLA\nrelevant  here,  the  Defendants’  failure  to  provide\ncomprehensible information to Section 8 beneficiaries about\nthe  payment  standard  change  and  its  effect  one  year in\nadvance of the change’s implementation:  (1) violated the due\nprocess  clauses  of  the  United  States  and  California\nConstitutions,  (2)  violated  California  Government  Code\n§ 815.6, which governs liability for public entities that breach\nmandatory duties, and (3) constituted negligence pursuant to\nCalifornia Government Code § 815.2.\nPlaintiff Michael Nozzi, a Section 8 beneficiary since\nDecember 2003, is totally and permanently disabled under\nSocial Security’s standards.  As a result of the 2004 change,\nhis expected rent contribution increased 48%—from $231 to\n$342 per month.  Plaintiff Nidia Palaez, a beneficiary since\nFebruary 2004, is a single mother with a young daughter. \nShe experienced a 177% increase in her portion of the rent as\na result of the 2004 change.  She alleges that this increase has\nadversely affected her family’s quality of life, that she has\nhad  difficulty  affording  suitable  school  clothes  for  her\ndaughter, and that she has had to divert money from her food\nbudget to cover her increased rent costs.\nBoth Nozzi and Palaez allege that they did not understand\nthat their Section 8 benefits would decrease and that their\nown  rent  obligations  would  increase until  they  received\nnotices approximately one year after the flyer, four weeks\nbefore the change in the payment standard adversely affected\ntheir rent contribution.

HACLA 13\nC. The District Court Disposes of Plaintiff’s Claims\nOn November 26, 2007, the district court for the Central\nDistrict of California dismissed the plaintiff’s negligence\nclaim.  The court held that the plaintiffs failed to establish an\nessential element for such claims against a public entity:  that\na statute imposed a mandatory duty on the entity.10\nIn early 2009, the parties filed cross-motions for summary\njudgment on the remaining issues.  With respect to the due\nprocess  claims,  the  Housing  Authority  argued  that  the\nplaintiffs did not have a property interest protected by the due\nprocess  clauses  of  the  United  States  or  California\nConstitutions.\nFurthermore, the Housing Authority asserted that, even if\nthe plaintiffs had a protected property interest, they received\nsufficient process because the Housing Authority had sent the\nflyer and “made significant efforts to increase participants’\nawareness of the 2004 VPS reduction through public hearings\nand community outreach.”  The Housing Authority supported\nits position with (1) declarations from Housing Authority\nemployees summarily stating that all Section 8 beneficiaries\nreceive instructional training upon entry into the Section 8\nprogram,  and  (2)  minutes  of  a  public  meeting  and  a\nPowerPoint  presentation  used  at  the  meeting  discussing\nchanges to the Housing Authority’s operation, during which\na brief discussion occurred regarding the payment standard\ndecrease.\n   10 The district court also dismissed other claims that are not relevant to\nthis appeal.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 14 of 48   Page ID #:1932\n14 NOZZI V. HACLA\nIn  response,  the  plaintiffs  argued  that  they  had  a\nlegitimate expectation in continued and stable Section 8\nbenefits.  They challenged the relevance of the Defendants’\npurported  training  sessions  and  public  meetings  to  the\nquestion whether the Housing Authority provided sufficient\nnotice  to  the  affected  beneficiaries.    Furthermore,  the\nplaintiffs asserted, the only relevant question was whether the\nflyer was reasonably comprehensible to the average recipient,\na  question  unaffected  by  the  Housing  Authority’s  other\nactions.\nThe district court granted summary judgment in favor of\nthe Housing Authority on the due process claims and the\nremaining  state  statutory  claim,  an  alleged  violation  of\n§ 815.6.  According to the district court, the plaintiffs could\nnot have a protectable property interest in their Section 8\nbenefits  because  the  Housing  Authority  had  complete\ndiscretion  to  reduce  the  payment  standard.    The  only\nrestriction,  the  district  court  wrote,  was  24  C.F.R.\n§ 982.505(c)(3), which required the agency to provide notice,\nbut did not create a property interest protectable by the due\nprocess clauses.\nWith regard to the California Government Code § 815.6\nclaim, the district court held that such a claim required the\nplaintiffs to show that the Housing Authority had breached a\n“mandatory duty” imposed by statute.  The court reasoned\nthat even if 24 C.F.R. § 982.505(c)(3) or the due process\nclauses created such a duty, there was no basis on which to\nconclude  that  the  Housing  Authority  had  breached  its\nobligations under that regulation.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 15 of 48   Page ID #:1933\nNOZZI V.

With regard to the\nplaintiffs’ due process claims, we held that the district court\n“improperly concluded that plaintiffs’ property interest in\nSection 8 benefits did not require adequate notice that their\nbenefits were subject to the planned reduction.”  425 F.\nApp’x at 541.  To begin with, the plaintiffs had a “well-\nsettled property interest” in Section 8 benefits because “the\nstatute, in tandem with regulatory requirements ‘restrict[ing]\nthe discretion’” of the Housing Authority, “protected against\nan abrupt and unexpected change in benefits.”  Id.11  We\nremanded for the district court to apply the Mathews v.\nEldridge  balancing  test  to  determine  if  the  Housing\nAuthority’s notice was sufficient.12  Id.\n   11 In so holding, the prior panel held that the grant of summary judgment\nin favor of the defendants was inappropriate because there was a material\nissue of fact as to whether the steps taken by the Housing Authority\nprotected against a sudden change in benefits.  The majority did not find\nit necessary, for purposes of reversing the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment, to address the merits of the plaintiffs’ contentions that\nthey had a right to a stable one-year term of benefits and that any steps by\nthe Housing Authority taken less than one year before the change would\nbe insufficient to protect this interest.\n   12 As described in greater detail below, Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S.\n319 (1976) requires courts, when determining what process is due to\nprotect an interest covered by the due process clause, to examine (1) the\nprivate interest that will be affected by an official action; (2) the risk of\nerroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and\nthe probable value of additional or substitute safeguards; and (3) the\ngovernment’s interest, which includes the administrative burdens of\nadditional or substitute procedures.

HACLA\nAs for the California Government Code § 815.6 claim, we\nnoted that the statute permits private individuals to sue public\nentities when three elements have been met:  (1) there is an\nenactment imposing a mandatory duty, (2) that enactment is\nintended to protect the individual from the type of injury\nsuffered, and (3) the breach of the mandatory duty was the\nproximate cause of the injury suffered.  Id.  We held that the\n“district court incorrectly concluded that the notice provided\nby defendants satisfied the mandatory duty in § 982.505 to\nprovide one-year notice before implementing the reduced\n[payment  standard].”    Id.    The  notice  required  by  the\nregulation must be, “[a]t a minimum,” “sufficiently effective\nto protect housing benefits recipients from an abrupt and\nunexpected reduction in benefits.”  Id.  Accordingly, this\nCourt remanded the § 815.6 claim for further consideration.13\nFinally, we held that the district court’s dismissal of the\nplaintiffs’  state  law  negligence  claim  was  “erroneous”\nbecause public entities “may be held vicariously liable for the\nnegligent acts of their individual employees” under California\nGovernment  Code  §  815.2.    Id.    This  claim  was  also\nremanded for further consideration.\nE. Remand and the Current Appeal\nOn remand from Nozzi I, pursuant to a jointly agreed\nupon phased discovery plan, the plaintiffs sought discovery\nof the identities of Section 8 tenants who had been sent the\nflyer and whose benefits were ultimately affected by the\ndecreased payment standard.  They also sought discovery\n   13 Again, for the purposes of reversing summary judgment in favor of the\ndefendants, the prior panel did not find it necessary to address whether\nplaintiffs’ had a right to a stable one-year term of benefits.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 17 of 48   Page ID #:1935\nNOZZI V. HACLA 17\npertaining to any training sessions and public outreach efforts\nby  the  Housing  Authority  that  concerned  the  payment\nstandard.  Before the completion of discovery, the Housing\nAuthority filed a renewed motion for summary judgment. \nThe plaintiffs objected that ruling on summary judgment\nshould be deferred under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n56(d), which allows the court to defer considering a motion\nfor summary judgment when the nonmovant shows that it\ncannot  yet  present  facts  essential  to  its  opposition.  The\nHousing  Authority  disagreed,  arguing  that  no  further\ndiscovery was necessary.\nThe district court ignored the plaintiffs’ request for more\ndiscovery and issued a tentative ruling granting summary\njudgment to the Housing Authority which it later reduced to\na final judgment.  In that order, the district court determined\nthat,  applying  the  Mathews  test,  plaintiffs  received\nconstitutionally adequate process.  Specifically, the district\ncourt reasoned, the flyer, training sessions, public outreach\nmeetings, and four-week notice provided more than enough\nnotice to Section 8 beneficiaries.\nWith regard to the California Government Code § 815.6\nclaim, the district court rejected the plaintiffs’ claim that the\nnotice provided was not adequate, and held that the totality of\nthe Housing Authority’s efforts protected plaintiffs from an\n“abrupt”  and  “unexpected”  reduction  in  their  Section  8\nbenefits.  Finally, the court held that the Housing Authority\ncould  not  be  vicariously  liable  for  the  conduct  of  its\nemployees,  because  its  employees  did  not  breach  any\nmandatory duty owed to the plaintiffs.  This appeal followed.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 18 of 48   Page ID #:1936\n18 NOZZI V. HACLA\nIII.  STANDING AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\nAs an initial matter, the Housing Authority claims that the\nplaintiffs lack standing to bring this action. It is incorrect.  To\nestablish standing, plaintiffs must establish that they have:\n(1) an  injury in fact,  (2) that is “fairly traceable to the\nchallenged action of the defendant” and (3) that is “likely to\nbe redressed by a favorable decision.”  Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992) (quotation marks\nomitted).    Here,  the  plaintiffs  alleged  that  the  Housing\nAuthority decreased the amount of their Section 8 benefits\nand therefore increased the amount they had to pay in rent\nwithout adhering to the protections required by due process\nand by Voucher Program regulations.  As the Supreme Court\nhas held, “[w]hen the suit is one challenging the legality of\ngovernment action or inaction” and “the plaintiff is himself\nan object of the action . . . there is ordinarily little question\nthat the action or inaction has caused him injury[.]”  Id. at\n561–62.  Plaintiffs request compensatory damages, as well as\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, for uncompensated injuries\nthat were ongoing when they filed their complaint.  As a\nresult, they met all three standing requirements.\nWe review the district court’s grant of summary judgment\nto the Housing Authority for each claim de novo and must\ndetermine whether, “viewing the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the non-moving party, there are any genuine\nissues of material fact and whether the district court correctly\napplied the substantive law.”  Leisik v. Brightwood Corp.,\n278 F.3d 895, 898 (9th Cir. 2002).14  If we determine that\n   14 Plaintiffs also contend that the district court abused its discretion in\ndenying their motion to postpone consideration of the Defendants’ motion\nfor summary judgment until the completion of discovery.  Because we\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 19 of 48   Page ID #:1937\nNOZZI V. HACLA 19\nthere are no genuine issues of material fact remaining, that\nthe Housing Authority does not prevail, and that it has had a\n“full  and  fair  opportunity”  to  present  its  case,  we  may\nconsider whether plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment. \nAlbino v. Baca, 747 F.3d 1162, 1176 (9th Cir. 2014) (en\nbanc).  Here, we also consider, at the plaintiffs’ request,\nwhether to reassign this case to a different district judge,\nwhich we may do only when a party can show “personal\nbiases or unusual circumstances,” such as when the district\njudge  can  be  reasonably  expected  to  have  substantial\ndifficulty setting aside his previous impressions of the case or\nwhen reassignment  is  desirable in  order to  preserve the\nappearance of  justice.  Krechman v. Cnty.  of  Riverside,\n723 F.3d 1104, 1111 (9th Cir. 2013).\nIV.  PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS\nA. The Contours of the Plaintiffs’ Property Right \nThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\nimposes procedural constraints on governmental decisions\nthat  deprive  individuals  of  liberty  or  property  interests. \nMathews, 424 U.S. at 332 (1976).15  Thus, the first question\nhold that granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants was\nimproper for other reasons, and because there is no cause for further\ndiscovery on the summary judgment issues following remand, we need not\naddress this contention.\n   15 The language of Article I § 7 of the California Constitution is\n“virtually identical” to the Due Process Clause of the United States\nConstitution,  with  the  caveat  that  California  courts  place  a  higher\nsignificance  on  the  dignitary  interest  inherent  in  providing  proper\nprocedure.  Today’s Fresh Start, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cnty. Office of\nEducation, 303 P.3d 1140, 1150 (Cal. 2013).  Recognizing this difference,\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 20 of 48   Page ID #:1938\n20 NOZZI V. HACLA\nin any case in which a violation of procedural due process is\nalleged is whether the plaintiffs have a protected property or\nliberty interest and, if so, the extent or scope of that interest. \nBoard of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564,\n569–70 (1972).  The property interests that due process\nprotects  extend  beyond  tangible  property  and  include\nanything to which a plaintiff has a “legitimate claim of\nentitlement.”    Id.  at  576–77.    A  legitimate  claim  of\nentitlement is created “and [its] dimensions are defined by\nexisting  rules  or  understandings  that  stem  from  an\nindependent  source  such  as  state  law—rules  or\nunderstandings that secure certain benefits and that support\nclaims of entitlement to those benefits.”  Id. at 577.  Further,\nas  we  have  previously  held,  plaintiffs  have  a  protected\nproperty right in public benefits when, as here, a statute\nauthorizes those benefits and the “implementing regulations”\n“greatly restrict the discretion” of the people who administer\nthose benefits.  See Griffeth v. Detrich, 603 F.2d 118, 121\n(9th Cir. 1979).\nThus, as we held in Nozzi I, the plaintiffs here have a\nproperty interest in Section 8 benefits to which the procedural\nprotections of the due process clause apply.  425 F. App’x at\n541  (“Section  8  participants  have  a  property  interest  in\nhousing  benefits[.]”);  Ressler  v.  Pierce,  692  F.2d  1212,\n1215–16 (9th Cir. 1982) (“In addition, [the plaintiff] has a\nconstitutionally protected ‘property’ interest in Section 8\nbenefits by virtue of her membership in a class of individuals\nwhom the Section 8 program was intended to benefit.”); see\nalso Roth, 408 U.S. at 576 (“[A] person receiving . . . benefits\nwe nevertheless address the plaintiffs’ federal and state due process claims\ntogether, as it is unnecessary to take the additional factor into account in\nthis case.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 21 of 48   Page ID #:1939\nNOZZI V.

See  Roth,  408  U.S.  at  577.    These\nregulations limit the Housing Authority’s discretion to alter\ntenants’ subsidies through changes to the payment standard\nunless tenants have been advised of the change and notified\nthat the reduced standard will not be implemented for at least\na full year afterwards.  See 24 C.F.R. § 982.505(c)(3); see\nalso Nozzi I, 425 F. App’x at 541–42 (“[T]he Section 8\nregulations ‘closely circumscribe’ [the Housing Authority’s]\ndiscretion—by  prohibiting  [it]  from  immediately\nimplementing a reduced [payment standard] and requiring [it]\nto  inform  participants  that  a  reduced  [standard]  will  be\nimplemented[.]”).  This mandatory one-year postponement is\ndesigned to serve as an “equitable . . . safeguard[] against\nreductions in subsidy.”  Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher\nProgram; Expansion of Payment Standard Protection, 65 Fed.\nReg. 42508-01, 42508 (July 10, 2000).\nThus, plaintiffs’ property right extends beyond Section 8\nbenefits generally.  The protected property right is in housing\nbenefits that continue in existence for a period of at least one\nyear after the beneficiary is advised that his benefits may be\ndecreased by a change to the payment standard.  The tenant\ncan budget for annual leases, plan for any drastic changes,\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 22 of 48   Page ID #:1940\n22 NOZZI V.

McMahon, 945 F.2d 1469 (9th Cir. 1991) to\nsupport  the  argument  that  the  plaintiffs  do  not  have  a\nprotected property interest, but that case is inapplicable.  In\nRosas, the local agency provided notice  of  a change to\nwelfare  benefits  10  days  before  its  implementation,  as\nrequired by a regulation.  Id. at 1472.  The plaintiffs insisted\nthat they were entitled to an earlier notice about which the\nstatutes and regulations said nothing.  Id. at 1474.  This court\nrejected the plaintiffs’ claim and held that welfare recipients\nhad no right to notice of the “passage of statutes” which\nreduced their benefits or to a “grace period” before benefits\nwere reduced.  Id. at 1473–74.\nRosas, however, relied on the fact that there was no “pre-\nexisting regulation intended to forestall the implementation\nof  a  congressionally  mandated  program  change  until\n[program participants] were provided with notice of that\nchange.”    Id.  at  1475.    Where,  as  here,  a  pre-existing\nregulation does forestall the implementation of a reduction in\nbenefits for a one year period, it is the plaintiffs’ property\ninterest in that term of benefits that procedural due process\nprotects.16  Accordingly, the question in this case is not\n   16 Similarly, as the prior panel noted, the district court and the Housing\nAuthority’s  reliance  on  Atkins  v.  Parker,  472  U.S.  115  (1985)  is\nmisplaced.  In that case, Congress changed the eligibility standards\nrequired for benefits under the Food Stamp Act.  There, the Court held\nthat “Congress has plenary power to define the scope and duration of the\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 23 of 48   Page ID #:1941\nNOZZI V.

App’x at 542.\nB. The Process Due\nOnce a substantive right has been created, “it is the Due\nProcess Clause which provides the procedural minimums, and\nnot a statute or regulation.”  Geneva Towers, 504 F.2d at 491\nn.13; Nozzi, 425 F. App’x at 542 (“Technical compliance\nwith regulatory procedures does not automatically satisfy due\nprocess requirements.”).  For this reason, in analyzing the\nplaintiffs’ due process claim, we do not address whether the\nHousing Authority complied with the requirements of 24\nC.F.R. § 982.505(c)(3), but whether the Housing Authority\ncomplied with the  requirements of the due process clause. \nWe conclude that it failed to do so, and indeed, that the flyer\nwas totally inadequate for that purpose.\nProcedural safeguards come in many forms, including,\ninter  alia, “timely and adequate notice,” pre-termination\nhearings,  the  opportunity  to  present  written  and  oral\narguments, and the ability to confront adverse witnesses.  See\nGoldberg  v.  Kelly,  397  U.S.  254,  267  (1970).    Which\nprotections are due in a given case requires a careful analysis\nof the importance of the rights and the other interests at stake. \nentitlement to food-stamp benefits” and thus welfare recipients were not\ndeprived of due process by Congress’s adjustment.  Id. at 129.  The\nHousing Authority, however, does not have plenary power to implement\na change in the payment standard.  Rather its authority is limited to\nchanging the amount of assistance one year or more after it has informed\nbeneficiaries of the change.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 24 of 48   Page ID #:1942\n24 NOZZI V.

Eldridge, the Supreme\nCourt set forth a three-part inquiry to determine whether the\nprocedures provided to protect a liberty or property interest\nare constitutionally sufficient.  424 U.S. at 334–35.  First,\ncourts must look at the nature of the interest that will be\naffected  by  the  official  action,  and  in  particular,  to  the\n“degree of potential deprivation that may be created.”  Id. at\n341.    Second,  courts  must  consider  the  “fairness  and\nreliability” of the existing procedures and the “probable\nvalue, if any, of additional procedural safeguards.”  Id. at 343. \nFinally,  courts  must  assess  the  public  interest,  which\n“includes the administrative burden and other societal costs\nthat  would  be  associated  with”  additional  or  substitute\nprocedures.  Id. at 347.17  Here, plaintiffs request notice of\nany intended changes to their housing subsidies provided at\nleast one year in advance of the change.\n   17 As the district court noted, the Supreme Court applies a streamlined\ntest when the only question to be decided is whether the government has\nprovided sufficient notice and there is no request for further procedural\nsafeguards.  Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306\n(1950).  Under Mullane, courts must determine whether the notice given\nwas “reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise\ninterested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an\nopportunity to present their objections.”  Id. at 314.  If we were to review\nthis case ab initio, we might simply apply Mullane to the facts of this case,\nas might well be appropriate.  See Dusenbery v. United States, 534 U.S.\n161, 167–68 (2002).  Because the prior panel instructed the district court\nto apply Mathews, we also conduct our due process analysis in terms of\nthe Mathews test.  We note, however, that the choice of test is not\ndispositive here.  For reasons that we explain below, the notice afforded\nto the plaintiffs in this case was insufficient under either test.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 25 of 48   Page ID #:1943\nNOZZI V. HACLA 25\n1. The Private Interest at Stake\nFirst, the private interest at stake in this case and the\n“degree of potential deprivation,” Mathews, 424 U.S. at 341,\nis substantial.  The 2004 decrease in payment standards\naffected Section 8 beneficiaries’ rent by an average of $104\nper month, a deprivation that could be “very serious to a poor\nperson.”  Geneva Towers, 504 F.2d at 492; see also Escalera\nv. New York City Hous. Auth., 425 F.2d 853, 864 (2d Cir.\n1970) (“[E]ven small charges can have great impact on the\nbudgets of public housing tenants, who are by hypothesis\nbelow a certain economic level.”).  For plaintiffs Nozzi and\nPalaez,  the  payment  standard  yielded  48%  and  177%\nincreases in their respective rent obligations.  This reduction\nin a tenant’s subsidies and accompanying increase in the cost\nof housing “could force tenants to forego other perhaps\nnecessary purchases and could even force some tenants to\nseek  other  less  expensive  housing.”    Geneva  Towers,\n504 F.2d at 491.\nFurthermore, for many Section 8 beneficiaries, subsidies\nfrom the Voucher Program for a stable and renewable one-\nyear term are the difference between safe, decent housing and\nbeing homeless.  A tenant’s inability to pay for an unexpected\nincrease in his portion of the rent and utilities could result in\neviction, which ultimately would require the public housing\nagency to terminate benefits, U.S. Dep’t of Housing & Urban\nDev., Housing Choice Voucher Program Guidebook, at 15-1,\n5, and render it impossible for the tenant to pay for a new\nunit.  This deprivation is especially dire considering the\nvulnerability of Section 8 recipients, a large portion of whom\nare elderly or disabled, and many of whom, like Plaintiff\nPelaez, have young children.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 26 of 48   Page ID #:1944\n26 NOZZI V. HACLA\n2. The Risk of Erroneous Deprivation\nTurning to the second Mathews inquiry, we must examine\nwhether  the  procedures provided  to  the  plaintiffs  risked\nerroneous deprivation of their right to stable and renewable\nSection 8 benefits, as well as the value of any additional\nsafeguards.  Plaintiffs here simply request fair notice:  simple\nand unadorned, reasonably comprehensible notice provided\nat  least  one  year  in  advance  of  the  change.    Thus,  to\ndetermine  the  fairness  and  reliability  of  the  safeguards\nprovided by the Housing Association and the probative value\nof this requested safeguard we look—as the district court\ndid—to Mullane and its progeny for guidance.\n“[W]hen notice is a person’s due, process which is a mere\ngesture is not due process.”  Mullane, 339 U.S. at 314.  To be\nconstitutionally  adequate,  notice  must  be  “reasonably\ncalculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested\nparties  .  .  .  with  due  regard  for  the  practicalities  and\nparticularities of the case[.]” Id. at 314.  The means employed\nmust be “reasonably certain” to “actually inform” the party,\nid., and in choosing the means, one must take account of the\n“capacities and circumstances” of the parties to whom the\nnotice is addressed, Goldberg, 397 U.S. at 268–69; Memphis\nLight, Gas & Water Division v. Craft, 436 U.S. 1, 14 n.15\n(1978).\nThe flyer was, without doubt, entirely insufficient to meet\nthis standard.  In no respect does it reasonably inform its\nintended recipients of the changes to the payment standard,\nthe meaning of those changes, or, most important, their effect\nupon the recipient.  Because of this, Section 8 beneficiaries\nwere  not  meaningfully  advised  regarding  the  payment\nstandard and were, accordingly, deprived of their right to a\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 27 of 48   Page ID #:1945\nNOZZI V. HACLA 27\none-year term of stable benefits in which to plan for the\nimpending potential hardship.\nTo begin with, the flyer, which essentially mirrored the\nlanguage of 24 C.F.R. § 982.505(c)(3), is incomprehensible\nto anyone without a relatively sophisticated understanding of\nthe Voucher Program’s payment calculations.  It uses the\nterm “payment standards” six times without ever defining or\nexplaining  the  term’s  meaning.    A  short  and  simple\nexplanation, such as “this means that the Housing Authority\nhas reduced the maximum amount it will contribute towards\nrecipients’  rent,”  would  have  provided  at  least  a  small\nmeasure of clarity.  The absence of such a minimal statement\nis particularly troublesome because, to the ordinary Section\n8  beneficiary,  the  flyer  might  well  suggest  that  the\nbeneficiary’s expected rent contribution would decrease.  See\nER 117 (“Effective April 2, 2004 the Housing Authority\nlowered  the  payment  standards  used  to  determine  your\nportion of the rent.”).  Moreover, the flyer which stated that\nthe change to the payment standards was “[e]ffective April 2,\n2004” was attached to an RE-38 that showed the tenant’s\nexpected rent contribution for the current year.  This could be\nconfusing to many tenants as that number was unaffected by\nthe change and could give the impression that the change to\nthe payment standard would not affect the tenant’s subsidy\namount at all—indeed that his subsidy would be higher than\nthe lower payment standard should allow.\nFurther, the flyer in no way explained the potential effect\nof the change:  that it could potentially increase the tenant’s\nexpected rent contribution and decrease his subsidy.  Indeed,\nas the Housing Authority estimated at the time, this change\nwould affect roughly 45% of Section 8 beneficiaries and\nrequire them to pay an average of $104 more in rent each\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 28 of 48   Page ID #:1946\n28 NOZZI V. HACLA\nmonth.  None of this information, however, was included in\nthe flyer.  Finally, the flyer was devoid of any name, address,\nor other information that Section 8 beneficiaries could contact\nfor assistance understanding the flyer’s contents.  The totality\nof these deficiencies makes it is impossible to say that the\nflyer was reasonably calculated to give notice to the average\nrecipient, or possibly even to the average reasonable jurist.18\nThe Housing Authority relies upon three actions that it\nasserts correct this failure inherent on the face of the flyer. \nNone does so, singly or collectively.  As discussed, absent\ncircumstantial changes such as an increase in income or\nchange in family composition, the plaintiffs had a legitimate\nexpectation in a one-year term of stable Section 8 benefits. \nThe first of the Housing Authority’s actions that it cites is the\nfour-week notice, which was sent only thirty days before the\nincrease in the tenants’ rent contribution was scheduled to be\nimplemented.  This notice could not possibly provide notice\na full year in advance of the scheduled change.19\n   18 Similarly unavailing is the Housing Authority’s reliance on a letter\npurportedly sent to all beneficiaries on April 19, 2005.  The Housing\nAuthority did not assert that this letter is in the record, nor is there any\nevidence of it being so.  It is only mentioned in passing in a discussion in\nthe deposition of one of the Housing Authority’s employees.  That\nemployee declared only that it was “similar to” the flyer.  For the reasons\nalready discussed, any letter that was simply “similar to” the flyer would\nbe inadequate to provide the necessary notice for the same reasons as the\nflyer itself.  Furthermore, the letter, like the four-week notice discussed in\nthe next paragraph, was sent too late to have been of any use to many\nbeneficiaries.\n   19 The Housing Authority relies on Willis v. United States, 787 F.2d\n1089 (7th Cir. 1986) for the proposition that this Court should consider\nsubsequent steps like the four-week notice.  That case is of no relevance. \nThere, a plaintiff claimed that procedures attending the forfeiture of his\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 29 of 48   Page ID #:1947\nNOZZI V. HACLA 29\nThe two other actions consisted of general advice offered\nprior to the receipt of the flyer:  the holding of “public\noutreach meetings” and the conducting of “training sessions.” \nBoth fell woefully short of advising the Section 8 recipients\nof  the  meaning  or  effect of  the  change  in  the  payment\nstandards.\nFirst, the public outreach meetings cannot serve to render\nthe Housing Authority’s deficient notice consistent with due\nprocess.    In  2004,  the  Housing  Authority  held  several\nmeetings about significant changes to the agency’s operations\nthat were open to the public.  A number of topics were\ndiscussed at these meetings, including the challenges faced by\nthe  Housing  Authority  in  implementing  the  Section  8\nprogram, the use of criminal background and credit checks of\nSection 8 beneficiaries, the portability of Section 8 benefits\nacross apartments, and the Housing Authority’s efforts to\nstabilize rent in the area.  As the Housing Authority noted,\n“part of the discussion” at these meetings, among the other\ntopics listed, were changes to the payment standard and the\nimpact on Section 8 beneficiaries.\nThese general meetings, however, are no substitute for\nnotice provided directly to the individual tenants.  As Mullane\nautomobile did not comport with the requirements of due process because\nhe only received a form letter containing nothing more than “legal\n‘jargon.’”  Id. at 1093.  The Seventh Circuit held that, while there was “no\nquestion that the language in the letter Willis received would not be\nadequate notice in itself,” that letter in combination with a second letter\nenclosed within the same envelope adequately informed Willis of the\nforfeiture  proceedings.    Id.    Unlike  Willis,  however,  the  Housing\nAuthority’s four-week notice was not contemporaneous with the flyer, and\ntherefore could not possibly help Section 8 beneficiaries comprehend the\nlegal jargon in the flyer at the time it was to be read.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 30 of 48   Page ID #:1948\n30 NOZZI V.

The Housing Authority\ncertainly knew the names and addresses of the Section 8\ntenants for whom it was supplying housing benefits, and\nindeed sent the flyers directly to the tenants, but it failed to\nprovide an understandable notice directly to them at the time\nit  would  be  relevant  to  the  loss  or  diminution  of  their\nbenefits.20    All  things  considered,  therefore,  the  public\noutreach meetings were not “reasonably certain to inform\nthose affected” of the change to the payment standard, or the\neffect of such change.  Mullane, 339 U.S. at 315 (emphasis\nadded).    Indeed,  even  construed  most  favorably  to  the\nHousing Authority, the outreach meetings when considered\nalong with all the other factors in this case fail to raise a\ngenuine issue of fact as to whether the steps taken by the\nHousing Authority provided constitutionally adequate notice\nof the potential change to the plaintiffs’ property rights.\nSecond,  the  training  sessions  held  by  the  Housing\nAuthority, even when considered along with all the other\nfactors relied on by the Authority, also cannot have rendered\nthe flyer “reasonably certain to inform” the average Section\n8 beneficiary of the potential reduction in benefits to occur\none year later.

According to declarations from Housing\nAuthority employees, the Authority fulfills this requirement\nby  requiring  all  new  beneficiaries  to  attend  a  one  hour\n“Session,” during which Housing Authority staff explains to\nthe new beneficiaries how a tenant’s rent contribution is\ncalculated,  which  includes  an  explanation  of  the  term\n“payment standard.”  The Housing Authority argues that this\nexplanation served to give sufficient meaning to the contents\nof the otherwise incomprehensible flyer.\nFor  many  affected  beneficiaries,  however,  this\ninformation was provided years before the flyer was sent. \nFor others, it may have been only a period of up to twelve\nmonths.  As Mullane makes clear, the fact that the Housing\nAuthority provided tenants with this information “months and\nperhaps years in advance” of the change to the payment\nstandard does not justify “dispensing with a serious effort to\ninform [the beneficiaries] personally” of the change to their\nbenefits  at  a  time  the  information  would  be  directly\nmeaningful.

In that case, when the common trust fund was created, the trust\ncompany mailed a notice to every person who might be entitled to a share\nof the fund’s income.  That notice included copies of state statutes that\nexplained that a judicial settlement of accounts would periodically occur\nafter the fund’s establishment, and that participants would be notified of\nthe  settlement  through  publications in their  local  newspaper.    The\nSupreme Court held that this procedure failed to comply with the\nrequirements of due process and that the trustee was required to undertake\na “serious effort to inform [those affected] personally of the accounting.” \nMost relevant to this case, the Supreme Court held that the trustee could\nnot dispense with this effort merely because it had previously provided\ninformation to those affected.  Instead, the Court held, those affected must\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 32 of 48   Page ID #:1950\n32 NOZZI V.

At that\nSession, information must be provided to new beneficiaries\nregarding:  where they may lease a unit, which landlords may\nbe willing to lease a unit to them, how long they have to find\na unit, how they may request an extension, the advantage of\nchoosing  to  live  in  an  area  that  does  not  have  a  high\nconcentration of low-income families, how to complete the\nforms required to request approval of a rental unit, 24 C.F.R.\n§  982.301,  how  people  with  disabilities  can  request  a\nreasonable accommodation, the amount of utilities that a\ntenant would be allowed to use, and what steps tenants can\ntake to avoid housing discrimination.  In that same one hour\nperiod, the Housing Authority also attempted to explain how\nthe  Voucher  Program  worked  generally,  including  the\nformula used to calculate a tenant’s portion of the rent and the\ncomplicated and convoluted role that the payment standards\nplay in that calculation.\nIn light of the overwhelming amount of information and\nthe complex and variegated subject matter involved, any data\nas to the meaning and effect of payment standards would\nlikely not be retained for a number of years or even a number\nbe informed, at the time of the impending settlement, “that steps were\nbeing taken affecting their interests.”  Id. at 318 (emphasis added).\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 33 of 48   Page ID #:1951\nNOZZI V.

It certainly\ncould not make the flyer, which was confusing, inadequate,\nand indeed unintelligible on its face, “reasonably certain” to\ninform Section 8 beneficiaries of a potential reduction in their\nsubsidies to take place one year after receipt of the flyer. \nMullane, 339 U.S. at 318.22  Thus, even when considered\nalong with all the other factors relied on by the Housing\nAuthority, no genuine issue of fact exists with respect to\nwhether the beneficiaries’ attendance at a Session renders the\notherwise  wholly  inadequate  flyer  compliant  with  due\nprocess.\nIn sum, there can be no genuine dispute of fact as to\nwhether the  Housing  Authority  provided  constitutionally\nadequate notice of the change to the payment standard, or\nmore important, the meaning and effect of the change on the\nplaintiffs’ Section 8 benefits.  The Housing Authority simply\nfailed to do so.  The simplest means of ensuring adequate\nnotice was the means requested by the plaintiffs:  a simple\nand clear letter, written in plain English (or Spanish), mailed\ndirectly to the plaintiffs one year in advance of the date of the\nchange’s  implementation—a  letter  that  contained  an\nunderstandable explanation of the change and the effect of\nthat change on Section 8 benefits;  in other words, a flyer that\nmet the requirements of due process.\n   22 Although we assume for the purposes of the above analysis that all\nbeneficiaries actually attended one of these required Sessions, we note that\nsome evidence suggests that not all beneficiaries actually did so.  Plaintiff\nPelaez states, for example, that she did not remember attending a training\nsession, and has no recollection of “ever having the concept of Voucher\nPayment Standards explained to [her.]”\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 34 of 48   Page ID #:1952\n34 NOZZI V. HACLA\nA proper notice would have made plaintiffs aware of the\nseriousness of the Housing Authority’s actions.  It might have\nstated, for example, that the Housing Authority estimated that\n“approximately 45% of [the] approximately 45,000 Section\n8 tenants [would] be adversely affected by the April 2004\n[payment standard] decrease, and [would] have to pay an\naverage of $104 more in rent each month if they chose to\nremain in their current units.”  It might also have provided\nbeneficiaries with a number to call in case they had questions\nabout the upcoming change or needed help finding a more\naffordable apartment in light of the change.  Instead, the\nHousing  Authority’s  flyer  failed  even  to  achieve  the\nminimum that due process requires:  an explanation of the\nchange to the payment standard and its likely effect upon\ntenants—an explanation that could reasonably be understood\nby the average Section 8 beneficiary.  The failure to do so\ndeprived the plaintiffs of the necessary one-year period of\nstable benefits in which to seek to avoid any impending\nhardship, and thus, of due process of law.\n3. The  Burden  of  Providing  the  Requested\nProcedure\nTurning  to  the  third  Mathews  inquiry,  affording  the\nprocedure requested by the plaintiffs would place no burden\non the Housing Authority.  The plaintiffs do not ask for a\nhearing, an individual meeting, or even an explanation of the\nprecise amount by which their portion of the rent would\nincrease.  They ask only for an elementary explanation of\nwhat a change to the payment standard means and what effect\nit has on tenants’ rights.  The Housing Authority’s argument\nthat it could not have sent a more precise notice because it\ncould  not  have  prospectively  calculated  whether  the\nplaintiffs’ rent would increase at the time it sent the flyer\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 35 of 48   Page ID #:1953\nNOZZI V. HACLA 35\nstems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the plaintiffs’\nchallenge.  The plaintiffs recognize that there are situations in\nwhich a tenant’s subsidies would not decrease despite the\nchange to the payment standard.23  The plaintiffs merely seek\na uniform notice that adequately explains the effect of the\nchange  in  payment  standard  in  a  manner  sufficient  to\nreasonably ensure that plaintiffs knew that they might well\nhave to plan for and adjust to a potential decrease in their\nsubsidy and an accompanying increase in the rent they must\npay commencing one year from the time they received the\nflyer.\nSurely this information could be readily incorporated into\nthe  standard  form  without  placing  any  burden  on  the\ngovernment’s fiscal and administrative resources.  There is no\nreason to conclude, after all, that “printing six paragraphs of\ninformation  is  any  more  burdensome  than  printing  four\nparagraphs of information.”  Henry v. Gross, 803 F.2d 757,\n768 (2d Cir. 1986).  Indeed, the Housing Authority printed a\nmore thorough explanation in letters that it sent to people\nother than those directly affected by the change.  Around the\nsame time that the Housing Authority sent the flyer to the\nexisting  tenants,  it  sent  a  letter  to  Voucher  Program\nbeneficiaries who had not yet found a unit to rent.  That letter\nexplained that the payment standard “is the most the Housing\nAuthority can pay for a unit.  If the rent for your unit is\nhigher, you must pay the difference in rent.”  An even clearer\nexplanation was sent to the Mayor, to members of the Los\nAngeles City Council, and to the members of the United\nStates Congress from California just before the change in the\n   23 A change in the payment standard would not affect, for example, a\ntenant whose entire unit cost less to rent than the new, decreased payment\nstandard.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 36 of 48   Page ID #:1954\n36 NOZZI V. HACLA\npayment standard was implemented.  Those letters explained\nthat the change to the payment standard “means many tenants\nwill soon begin paying more rent or, if they choose, move to\na less expensive unit,” and that the “average increase is\nestimated at $100/month.”24  Notably missing from the list of\npeople who received an adequate explanation are the people\nwho  needed it  most—the  same  people  that  due  process\nrequires  receive  adequate  notice—those  Section  8\nbeneficiaries whose rent might actually be increased by the\nchange.\nAccordingly, all of the Mathews v. Eldridge factors weigh\nin favor of the notice that the plaintiffs seek.  The Housing\nAuthority’s flyer, with its total absence of any effort to\nexplain the payment standard and its relation to tenants’\nobligations, was inadequate on its face, and the Housing\nAuthority  has  not  shown  that  any  additional  steps  were\nreasonably calculated to actually inform the plaintiffs of the\nnecessary information.25  Moreover, it is beyond dispute that\nthe Housing Authority could, at no extra cost or expense,\n   24 The letters sent to high-ranking officials, unlike the flyer that was sent\nto the plaintiffs, also provided a list of people who could help the Section\n8 beneficiaries with a housing search.\n   25 We reject the Housing Authority’s arguments that (1) there was a\nminimal risk that plaintiffs would have been erroneously deprived of their\nproperty interest because it legally decreased the payment standard and\nthat (2) any error connected with the notice was harmless because the\n“benefit change would have admittedly been the same.”  Again, these\narguments stem from a misunderstanding of the nature of plaintiffs’\nprotected property interest.  While the Housing Authority could lawfully\nchange the payment standard, the plaintiffs have a legitimate expectation\nin a one-year term of benefits to plan for and adjust to upcoming changes. \nThe Housing Authority’s failure to provide adequate notice deprived them\nof that right.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 37 of 48   Page ID #:1955\nNOZZI V.

This factor\nstrongly favors the plaintiffs.  The district court, therefore,\nerred in granting summary judgment to the defendants on\nboth due process claims.\nC. Remedy\nOrdinarily, where there has not been a cross-motion for\nsummary judgment, we would reverse and remand to the\ndistrict court for further factual development.  We conclude,\nhowever, that even when viewing the facts in the light most\nfavorable to the Housing Authority, there is no genuine\ndispute of material fact for a fact-finder to decide.  In this\ncase, therefore, the appropriate remedy is to grant summary\njudgment in favor of the plaintiffs nostra sponte.\n“We have long recognized that, where the party moving\nfor summary judgment has had a full and fair opportunity to\nprove its case, but has not succeeded in doing so, a court [of\nappeal] may enter summary judgment sua sponte for the\nnonmoving party.”  Albino v.

So long as the moving party has “be[en] given\nreasonable notice that the sufficiency of his or her claim will\nbe in issue,” Buckingham v. United States, 998 F.2d 735, 742\n(9th Cir. 1993), and has therefore had “adequate time to\ndevelop the facts on which the litigant [would] depend to\noppose  summary  judgment,”  Portsmouth  Square  v.\nShareholders Protective Comm., 770 F.2d 866, 869 (9th Cir.\n1985), sua sponte summary judgment is appropriate.  Doing\nso preserves judicial resources by preventing courts from\nhaving to preside over “unnecessary trials” where no genuine\nissues of fact are in dispute, which is consistent with the\noverall “objective of [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56] of\nexpediting the disposition of cases.”  10A Charles A. Wright,\nArthur R. Miller & Mary K. Kane, Federal Practice and\nProcedure § 2720, at 345 (3d ed. 1998).\nThe  Housing  Authority  has  been  afforded  ample\nopportunity to develop the facts on which it would oppose\nsummary judgment.

Moreover, the\nHousing Authority has had two rounds of litigation in which\nto develop the facts necessary to oppose summary judgment. \nThe issues here are identical to those litigated before the\ndistrict court in Nozzi I.  At that time, the plaintiffs made a\ncross-motion  for  summary  judgment,  and  the  Housing\nAuthority had a full and complete opportunity to develop\nfacts to oppose it.  On remand, the Housing Authority had the\nopportunity to develop additional facts, but it declined to do\nso.  Instead, it strategically chose to move for a pre-trial\ndisposition before the close of discovery and effectively cut\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 39 of 48   Page ID #:1957\nNOZZI V.

In  short,  the\nHousing Authority had more than enough notice that the\nsufficiency of its defense was at issue.\nDespite having this opportunity, the Housing Authority\nhas not produced evidence suggesting that there is an issue of\nmaterial fact that is appropriate for resolution by a fact-finder. \nAs explained in greater detail above, it is beyond dispute that\nthe flyer was constitutionally inadequate.  On its face, it was\nclearly inadequate and failed to provide notice in a form that\nSection  8  recipients  could  comprehend.    The  Housing\nAuthority’s  subsequent  steps  cannot  solve  the  flyer’s\ndeficiency as a matter of law, as those steps occurred too late\nto  protect  the  plaintiffs’  legitimate  expectation  in  an\nunaffected one-year period of benefits in which to plan for\nany adverse effects of the change.\nAdditionally, the Housing Authority’s reliance on the\ntraining sessions and the public outreach meetings fails to\nraise  a  genuine  issue  of  material  fact  appropriate  for\nresolution by a jury.  The meetings it held could not, as a\nmatter of law, have been sufficient to afford the plaintiffs the\nnotice that due process requires.  The training sessions when\nbeneficiaries first entered the program provided relatively\nminimal information on the meaning of “payment standard,”\nand this information was provided months or years before the\nflyer was sent.  Thus, the training sessions cannot have served\nto  ensure  that  the  confusing  and  inadequate  flyer  was\n“reasonably  certain”  to  “actually  inform”  the  average\nbeneficiary that he had one year in which to plan for a\npotential reduction to his benefits.  Because there are no\ngenuine issues of material fact as to whether the Housing\nAuthority complied with the requirements of due process, we\nremand  with  instructions  to  the  district  court  to  grant\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 40 of 48   Page ID #:1958\n40 NOZZI V.

THE OTHER STATE LAW CLAIMS \nNext,  we  turn  to  the  plaintiffs’  allegations  that  the\nHousing  Authority  violated  various  provisions  of  the\nCalifornia  Government  Code.    California  has  abolished\ncommon law tort liability for public entities.  Miklosy v.\nRegents of California, 188 P.3d 629 (Cal. 2008).  Thus, under\nCalifornia law, “‘[a] public entity is not liable for an injury,’\n‘[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute.’”  Eastburn v.\nRegional Fire Prot. Auth., 80 P.3d 656, 657–58 (Cal. 2003)\n(quoting Cal. Gov. Code § 815(a)).  Plaintiffs claim that the\nHousing Authority is liable under two statutes:  (1) California\nGovernment Code § 815.6 which governs liability for public\nentities that breach their mandatory duties, and (2) California\nGovernment Code § 815.2 which governs vicarious liability\nfor public employees’ negligence.\nA. California Government Code § 815.6\nUnder California Government Code § 815.6, a public\nentity will be liable to a plaintiff for injury “when (1) a\nmandatory  duty  is  imposed  [on  the  public  entity]  by\nenactment, (2) the duty was designed to protect against the\nkind of injury allegedly suffered, and (3) breach of the duty\nproximately  caused injury,”  unless  the  public  entity  can\n“establish  that  it  exercised  reasonable  diligence”  in\ndischarging  this  mandatory  duty.    State  Dept.  of  State\nHospitals v. Superior Court, 349 P.3d 1013, 1018 (Cal.\n2015); see also Chaudhry v. City of Los Angeles, 751 F.3d\n1096,  1106–07  (9th  Cir.  2014).    The  “mandatory  duty”\nbreached  by  the  public  entity  must  be  created  by  a\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 41 of 48   Page ID #:1959\nNOZZI V.

Gov’t Code § 810.6, including federal\nregulations, id. § 811.6 (defining “regulation’ as including\nfederal regulations).26  Further, it must be “obligatory, rather\nthan merely discretionary or permissive, in its directions to\nthe public entity,” and must “require rather than merely\nauthorize or permit, that a particular action be taken[.]”  State\nDept. Of State Hospitals, 349 P.3d at 1018–19 (emphasis in\noriginal).\nWe hold that, even taking the facts in the light most\nfavorable to the Housing Authority, there can be no dispute\nthat it is liable under the statute.  To begin with, as we have\ndetermined above, the Voucher Program regulations create a\nmandatory duty to advise plaintiffs of the change in the\npayment standard, the meaning of that change, and its effect\nupon  them.    24  C.F.R.  §  982.505(c).27    The  Housing\nAuthority argues that Section 982.505(c) creates only a duty\nto send a one-year notice, with no obligations as to the form\nof  that  notice.    This  is  incorrect.    At  a  minimum,  the\ninformation given to the tenants about the change in payment\nstandards and the one-year period that tenants have to prepare\n   26 See also Hines v. United States, 60 F.3d 1442, 1448–49 (9th Cir.\n1995) (holding that under California law, federal regulation created a\nmandatory duty), abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Olson,\n546 U.S. 43 (2005); Bowman v. Wyatt, 111 Cal. Rptr. 3d 787, 808 n.10\n(Ct. App. 2010) (noting that jury was instructed that mandatory duty under\n§ 815.6 could be supplied by federal regulation).\n   27 Notwithstanding the Housing Authority’s assertion to the contrary, the\nfact that there is no federal cause of action to enforce directly 24 C.F.R.\n§ 982.505(c)(3) does not defeat plaintiffs’ § 815.6 claim.  See Haggis v.\nCity of Los Angeles, 993 P.2d 983, 988 (Cal. 2000) (“It is section 815.6,\nnot the predicate enactment, that creates the private right of action.”\n(emphasis in original)).\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 42 of 48   Page ID #:1960\n42 NOZZI V.

A mandatory obligation to provide\nnotice includes the obligation to provide an intelligible notice\nthat can be understood by its average intended recipients and\nmust convey the information required by the regulation.\nNext, it is apparent that the regulation was “designed to\nprotect against the kind of injury” the plaintiffs suffered. \nHaggis, 993 P.2d at 987–88.  The regulation was created as\nan equitable “safeguard” for tenants “against reductions in\nsubsidy,” that would give Section 8 beneficiaries one year in\nwhich to plan for adjustments to the payment standard that\ncould adversely affect their subsidy.  Section 8 Housing\nChoice Voucher Program; Expansion of Payment Standard\nProtection, 65 Fed. Reg. at 42508.  Here, because plaintiffs\nwere not given meaningful information about the change in\nthe  payment  standard  and  its  meaning  and  effect,  the\nplaintiffs were deprived of the very one-year stable planning\nperiod that the regulation was designed to protect.\nFinally, the Housing Authority breached this mandatory\nduty and this breach was the proximate cause of injury to the\nplaintiffs.    As  described  earlier,  the  flyer  was  totally\nincomprehensible to anyone without a relatively sophisticated\nunderstanding  of  the  machinations  of  Section  8  subsidy\npayments.  It did not provide the average recipient with any\nmeaningful information about the change or its potential\nadverse impact.  As with the due process claims, the Housing\nAuthority argues that no injury could have occurred because\nit had total discretion to decrease the payment standard.  Once\nagain,  the  Authority  misunderstands  the  nature  of  the\nplaintiffs’ challenge.  The question here is not whether the\npayment  standard  could  be  decreased,  but  whether  the\nmanner in which the Housing Authority implemented the\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 43 of 48   Page ID #:1961\nNOZZI V.

The answer is that\nit did, and that plaintiffs, who experienced an unexpected and\ndramatic increase in their rental obligations, suffered from\nthat breach.\nWhat remains then, is the question whether the Housing\nAuthority “exercised reasonable diligence to discharge the\nduty.”  Cal. Gov’t Code § 815.6.  As described in greater\ndetail  above,  there  are extreme  deficiencies in  the  flyer\nprovided to the plaintiffs.  The Housing Authority has had\ntwo opportunities to come forward with evidence in support\nof its motion for summary judgment and a further opportunity\nto rebut the cross-motion for summary judgment brought by\nthe plaintiffs in Nozzi I.  Despite this, it has fallen far short of\nproducing evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact\nas  to  whether  it  made  reasonable  efforts  to  provide\nmeaningful information to the plaintiffs about the payment\nstandard change and its adverse effect upon them.\n The Housing Authority initially took the position that it\nwas “impossible” to draft a different, more comprehensible\nnotice,  but  that  position  is  plainly  contradicted  by  the\nundisputed evidence.  The Housing Authority was clearly\ncapable of explaining the meaning and effect of the payment\nstandard.  It provided a comprehensible notice to Voucher\nProgram beneficiaries who had not yet found a unit to rent. \nIndeed, it provided an even more thorough explanation of the\nmeaning and effect of the change to the Mayor, members of\nthe Los Angeles City Council, and California congressmen.\nThe Housing Authority produced evidence, in the form of\na  declaration  by  the  individual  who  wrote  the  flyer,\npurportedly showing that he exercised reasonable efforts. \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 44 of 48   Page ID #:1962\n44 NOZZI V. HACLA\nEven construing this declaration in the light most favorable\nto the defendants, however, it is insufficient to raise a genuine\nissue of fact as to whether the Housing Authority exercised\nreasonable  efforts  to  comply  with  the  regulation.    The\ndeclaration states that the employee drafts all of his notices in\nlanguage that can be understood by a person with an eighth\ngrade education.  This is a conclusion that is belied by the\nevidence.  The flyer unquestionably does not explain the\nmeaning and effect of the change in the payment standard in\nany terms at all, let alone in terms that can be understood by\na person with an eighth grade education.  The employee\nadmittedly simply took the flyer’s language directly from the\nregulation, and the Housing Authority did not offer any\nevidence that he took any steps to ensure that the language\nwould provide any meaningful information about the change\nthat would advise the average recipient of its meaning or\neffect.  Nor did the Housing Authority offer any evidence\nsuggesting  that  the  employee  considered  alternatives  to\nmerely parroting the regulation, such as, inter alia, defining\npayment standard—as did the letters sent to house-hunting\nSection 8 beneficiaries and to the public officials.\nThus,  as  with  the  due  process  claims,  the  Housing\nAuthority had ample opportunity to develop facts to support\nits defense against the state law claims, but failed to do so. \nAccordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court and\nremand with instructions to grant summary judgment in favor\nof the plaintiffs on the merits of this statutory claim.\nB. California Government Code § 815.2\nUnder California Government Code § 815.2, a public\nentity is “vicariously liable for its employees’ [non-immune]\nnegligent  acts  or  omissions  within  the  scope  of\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 45 of 48   Page ID #:1963\nNOZZI V. HACLA 45\nemployment[.]”    Eastburn  v.  Regional  Fire  Protection\nAuthority, 80 P.3d 656, 658 (Cal. 2003).  The Housing\nAuthority asserts, and the plaintiffs do not dispute, that\nplaintiffs  theory  of  negligence  is  “essentially\ninterchangeable” with its § 815.6 claim discussed in Section\nV.A above.  Indeed, the elements of a vicarious liability claim\nagainst a public entity in California are “virtually identical”\nto the elements of a § 815.6 claim.  Alejo v. City of Alhambra,\n89 Cal. Rptr. 2d 768, 771 & n.3 (Ct. App. 1999); see also San\nMateo Union High School District v. Cnty. of San Mateo,\n152 Cal. Rptr. 3d 530, 542–544 (Ct. App. 2013).  The above\ndiscussion of the plaintiffs’ § 815.6 claim, therefore, applies\nequally to their vicarious liability claim and they are entitled\nto summary judgment on the merits of this claim as well.\nVI.    REASSIGNMENT\nPlaintiffs have requested that we use our supervisory\npower to reassign this case to a different district judge on\nremand.  We reassign a case to a different district judge in\n“unusual circumstances.”  Krechman v. County of Riverside,\n723 F.3d 1104, 1111 (9th Cir. 2013).  To determine whether\nsuch reassignment is appropriate we look to three factors: \n(1) whether the original judge could “reasonably be expected\nupon remand to have substantial difficulty in putting out of\nhis  or  her  mind  previously-expressed  views  or  findings\ndetermined to be erroneous or based on evidence that must be\nrejected,” (2) whether reassignment is advisable to preserve\nthe appearance of justice, and (3) whether reassignment\nwould “entail waste and duplication out of proportion to any\ngain  in  preserving  the  appearance  of  fairness.”    Id.  at\n1111–12.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 46 of 48   Page ID #:1964\n46 NOZZI V. HACLA\nOn remand from Nozzi I, the district judge made a number\nof statements indicating his strong disagreement with this\nCourt’s holding in Nozzi I.  Then, before ruling in favor of the\nHousing Authority for the second time, the judge stated,\n“When you do argue this in the Ninth Circuit, don’t make just\nthat argument, because if you do . . . we’ll be back here again,\nand I’ll be tearing out my hair and saying I don’t understand\nwhy this happened the way it did.  In fact, let me just indicate\nthat if this case gets reversed, I want it to be like Judge\nWright or Judge Real.  I want it to go to some other district\ncourt judge, because I have spent a lot of time on this case. \n. . . I pretty much have done all I can.”\nThe district judge’s statements constitute a “rare and\nextraordinary  circumstance[]”  justifying  reassignment. \nKrechman, 723 F.3d at 1112.  The judge repeatedly made\nclear that he would have substantial difficulty setting aside\nhis previous views of the case.  Under these circumstances,\nremand is not only “advisable,” Krechman, 723 F.3d at 1111,\nbut essential in order to preserve the appearance of justice. \nAccordingly,  we  need  not  consider  the  third  factor. \nKrechman, 723 F.3d at 1102 (“The first two factors are\nequally important and a finding of either is sufficient to\nsupport reassignment on remand.”).  Regardless whether\nduplication of effort would be involved, we have no choice\nbut to send the case to a judge whose designation would\nappear to be consistent with the interests of justice.28  Lastly,\nwe hold that this case must be reassigned to a district judge\n   28 Although it does not affect our decision, we note that reassignment\nwill not entail more than minimal duplication as there is little, if any,\noverlap between issues to be resolved on remand and the issues previously\nconsidered by the district court.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 47 of 48   Page ID #:1965\nNOZZI V. HACLA 47\nother than one of the two judges named by Judge Wu in order\nto “preserve the appearance of justice.”  Id.\nVII.  CONCLUSION\nIn sum, the district court erred by granting summary\njudgment to the Housing Authority.  There is no genuine\ndispute of fact as to whether the Housing Authority failed to\nprovide meaningful information to Section 8 beneficiaries\nabout the change to the payment standard and the effect of\nthat  change  upon  the  beneficiaries  and  their  property\ninterests.  That failure violated both the requirements of the\nVoucher  Program  regulations  and  the  requirements  of\nprocedural due process.  It also resulted in a violation of two\nstate statutes which require public entities to take reasonable\nefforts to comply with the mandatory duties established by\nfederal regulations.  Accordingly, we reverse and remand\nwith instructions for the district court to enter summary\njudgment in favor of the plaintiffs on the merits of the federal\nand state law claims at issue on this appeal.  In order to\npreserve  the  appearance  of  justice,  we  order  the  case\nreassigned to a different district judge—a judge other than the\ntwo identified by the current district judge who himself has\ndeclined to hear the case further.  On remand, further factual\ndevelopment  may  be  needed  to  determine  the  size  and\nvalidity of plaintiffs’ class and to determine the appropriate\nremedy.\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 218   Filed 11/30/15   Page 48 of 48   Page ID #:1966\n48 NOZZI V.

For over thirty years, the federal <çsection 8 Program'' has provided\n3  housing benefits across the country to a highly vulnerable population comprised of\n4  impoverished, elderly, and often disabled residents, many of whom would swell\n5  the ranks of the homeless but for this critical governm ent assistance. Housing\n6  benefits are provided in the form of a Cdvoucher'' or housing subsidy, which\n7  supplements the amount paid by the recipient for rent and utilities.\n8  2.  ln or around July of 2005, the Housing Authority of the City of Los\n9  Angeles (CIHACLA'R), which adrninîsters the Sectîon 8 Program locally, began\n10  implem enting a large-scale rollback of housing benefits provided to Section 8\n1 1  recipients in its jurisdiction. The reduction was significant, averaging $121 per\n12  month, or over l0% of a typical recipient's household income.\n13  3.  Before doing so, however, HACLA was required by applicable\n14  federal regulations, independently enforceable as well tluough state law, to provide\n15  adequate notice at least one year prior to ,the cut in the level of services. This\n16  specific and mandatory one-year notice requirement was created so that recîpients\n17  facing a benefit decrease would have sufficient time to either look for alternative  I\n18  housing, or make other anungements to accom modate this significant change in\n19  assistance.\nI\n20  4.  HACLA did not make any meaningful attempt to comply with this\n2 1  notice requirement. Rather than separately providing a formal adnlinistrative\n22  notice informing Section 8 recipients that they would be responsible for a specific  I\n23  increase in rent, HACLA inserted into a large stack of materials sent to each\n24  recipîent a nondescript and technically worded flyer that failed to convey any\n25  I\nuseful information relating to the change in benefits.  This flyer had absolutely no\n26  indicia of proper notice: it was not printed on letterhead; it did not specify the\n27  legal basis for the action; it did not provide a phone number for inquiries; it did not  I\n28 2\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\nI\nI l\n\nl\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 1   Filed 01/16/07   Page 3 of 58   Page ID #:3667\n1  specify any procedure for appeal; it did not require a signature acknowledging\n2  receipt; and, most importantly, it did not inform recipients that their rent payments\n3  would be going up.\n4  5.  HACLA'S absolute failure to comply with the Section 8 notice\n5  requirem ents renders the subsequent implementation of the subsidy reduction\n6  unlawful. lt constimtes a uniform due process violation of a1l affected recipients'\n7  property interest in this federal program . As a result, over 23,000 Section 8\n8  recipients living in Los Angeles (including nearly 5,000 elderly families and 4,500\n9  disabled fannilies) literally and figuratively had the rug pulled out from under them.\n10  They have been and will continue to be unlawfully deprived of federal housing\nl l  benests estimated at over $25 rnillion.\n12  6.  The actions of a11 defendants have resulted in the denial of Plaintiffs'\n13  and the class m embers' constitutional, statutory, and connnnon law rights.\n14  Furthermore, the acts of Defendants HACLA and the City of Los Angeles\n15  demonstrate an affirmative policy, and/or custom, and/or practice of condoning the\n16  conduct set out herein.\n17  7 I\nThis action seeks class-wide relief to enjoin Defendants' continuing\n. \n1 8  vîolations, and to provide restitm son to the class of affected Section 8 recipients\nl 9  who suffered an unlawful increase in their rent, lt is ideally suited for Rule 23  I\n20  class treatment because Defendants' failure to provide constitutionally adequate\n2 1  notice is a direct result of a policy and practice that was applied uniformly to all  I\n22  affected class members.\n23  ll.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE\nI\n24  8.  This is a civil action over which this Court has original jurisdiction\n25  under 28 U.S.C. j1331 in that it seeks redress under 42 U.S.C. j1983 (ttsection\n26  1983'') for the deprivation I\ntmder color of state law, of rights, privileges, and\n, \n27  immunities secured by federal statutes and the United States Constitution.

Plaintiffs' action for\n3  declaratory and injunctive relief is authorized by 20 U.S.C. jj220l, 2202, and\n4  1343 and by Fed. R. Civ. P. 57 and 65. Plaintiffs' state 1aw claims are so related to\n5  their federal 1aw claim s that they form part of the sam e case or controversy.\n6  Accordingly, supplemental jurisdiction over those claims is appropriate under 28\n7  U.S.C. j1367.\n8  9.  Venue in this Court is proper under 20 U.S.C. j139 1(b) because\n9  various Defendants reside in this judicial district.

The local PHA adm inisters the Housing\n9\nl 0 Choice Voucher Program under contract with HUD, and has, among others, the\nl l responsibility of determining the Voucher Payment Standard (1CVPS'') - the\n1 2  m aximum monthly subsidy a Housing Authority can provide to a farnily. See 24\n13  C.F.R. j982.505(a). The VPS is the subsidy generally needed to allow a Section 8\n14  recipient to rent a moderately-priced dwelling unit in the local housing market and\n15  is used to calculate the amount of housing assistance a fam ily will receive\n.\n16  24  HACLA 'S latest website indicates that it adrninisters over 36\n000\n,\n17  section 8 Housing choice voucher tenancies in the City of Los Angeles\nThese\n. \n1 8 t\nenancies are comprised of 59% farnilies with children, 27% elderly individuals,\n1 9\nand 14% non-elderly disabled persons. Sources of income for these familîes\n20\ninclude wages (22%), Supplemental Security lncome ($tSS1'')(20%), CaIWORKS\n2 1\n22 (19%), Social Security Disability lncome (&tSSD1'') and Social Security Retirement\n23 lncome (ûdSSA'') (13%), General Relief (4%), and 23% coming from other and\n24 combined sources.\nzj  B.

Before lowering the VPS, however, Housing Authorities must comply\n8\nwith a very specifc timeline relating to notice. A PHA must provide proper notice\n9\nl 0 to a recipient whose benefits are being reduced at the first annual reexamination\n11 following the change in services. 24 C.F.R. 982.505(c)(3)(ii). The actual\n12  reduction in benefits cannot occur until one year after this notice, upon the\n- -\nl 3  completion of the second reexamination after the effective date of the decision to\n14  decrease the level of services. f#.\n15  C HACLA 'S Failure to Provide Notice\n. \n16  28  On April 2\n2004, HACLA made a decision to reduce the pre-existing\n, \n17  vps  The impact on section 8 pm icipants was significant\nFor example, the vPS\n. \nIF  dçb\nfor a O-bedroom ( achelor'') apartment plummeted from $795 to only $674, a\n19\nreduction of $ 121 per m onth.\n20\n29.  To implement this change in policy, HACLA stuck a one-page flyer in\n2 l\nthe materials mailed to each recipient on the date of their annual reexamination.\n22\n23 Unlike other explanatory notices contained in these packets, the flyer did not\n24 require the recipient to acknowledge receipt by signing and returnîng the form .\nzj  The flyer was not on letterhead, did not contain a phone number for inquiries, and\n26  did not give a legal basis for the decision. M ore importantly, the flyer did not\n27  advise recipients that their out-of-pocket rent payment would actually be going up\n28 9\nCLASS ACTION COM PLAINT\n\nl\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 1   Filed 01/16/07   Page 10 of 58   Page ID #:3674\n1  (much less specify the amount of the increase). Plaintiffs are informed and\n2  believe and on that basis allege, that these tlyers were sent out (buried among\n, \n3  other reexarnination materials) from approximately July 2004 tkough July 2005\n.\n4 30\nThe language of the flyer did not meaningfully communicate to the\n. \n5\nrecipient that there would actually be a reduction in the portion of his or her rent\n6\nthat HACLA would pay, and a corresponding increase in the portion of his or her\n7\nrent that the recipîent would be required to pay.\n8\n31.  The VPS decrease went into effect with reexaminations that took\n9\nl 0 place from July 2005 through July 2006. According to HACLA estimates,\nl 1 approxim ately 45% of HACLA 'S approxim ately 45,000 Section 8 participants\n12  were adversely affected by the April 2004 VPS decrease.\n13  D.

Plaintiffs' claims are typical of those of the Class.\n4  52.  Plaintiffs can and will fairly and adequately represent and protect the\n5  interests of the proposed Class. Plaintiffs have no interest that conflicts with, or is\n6  antagonistic to, the interests of the proposed Class. Plaintiffs have employed\n7  attorneys who are experienced and competent in consumer and civil rights\n8  litigation and class actions, and are able to adequately and vigorously pursue this\n9  class action on behalf of a11 class members.\nl 0  53.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and\nl 1  efficient adjudication of the claims asserted herein given that:\n12  a.  Common questions of 1aw and fact predom inate over any\n13  individual questions that may arise. There would be enorm ous economies to the\n14  court and the parties in litigating the common issues on a class-wide basis.\n15  Plaintiffs' proof of liability will be based on the factual and legal nature of\n16  HACLA 'S purported notice - which was disthbuted în the same way to all the\n17  members of the class.  I\nl 8  b.

Accordingly, the Plaintiff\n6  Class had an independent property interest in the regulation as incop orated into\n7  Govt. Code 5815.6 pursuant to California law.\n8  59.  Furthermore, Plaintiffs had a protected property interest in their\n9  Voucher Payment Standard pursuant to the provisions of 42 U.S.C. j1437f(o).\n10  6O.  Thus, Plaintiffs had a property interest in the provisions of C.F.R.\n1 l  982.505(c)(3)(ii) under both state and federal law, and b0th independently (i.e., the\n12  regulation, the state statme and the federal statme each standing alone) and\nl 3  collectively (i.e., the three considered together in light of each).

Irl the two years preceding the filing of this claim, Claimants allege\nthe following:\n'  a)  hn 2004 ,the City and the Housing Authori'ty of the City of Los Angeles ('CHACLX')\ndecided to reduce the maximum monthly subsidy provided to a fmnily, effectively increasing the rent\npol-tion to be paid by Section 8 recipients fDr their housing. Under 24 C.F.R. j982.505(c)(ii), however,\neach affected fnmily was required to have been advised, at the first nnnual reexarnination following the\nchange in policy, that the benefit reduction wouid not take place until after the recipient's second\nalmual reexamination (f.c., the following yeaz afler the notice.) . The City tltterly failed to comply with\ntlais notification prerequisite.\nb)  Rather than providing recipients with clear notification that their rent obligation would\nb eincreased the following year, HACEA mailed a one-page flyer in April 2004 containing the cryptic\nand techllical statement tlnat the Housing Autholity çtlowered the paym ent standrds used to determine\n.\nyour pol4ion of the rent.'' Tllis flyer had no indicia of an official notics: it was not pdnted on City or\nHACLA letterhead; it did not specify the lega) basis for the action; it did not give a phone number for\ninquiries; it did not require any aclmowledgement or signature by the recipient; and it did not specify\nany procedku'e for appealing the administrative decision. M ore impolantly, the flyer did not advise\nrecipients tlnat their rent obligation would acmally be going up, by how much, or when.

PELAEZ vs. City of Los Arlgeles\nTO N IOM IT M AY CONCERN:\nThis ietter constitutes a claim for dnrnages pursuant to CalifoY a Government Code 5910 et\nseq., fcr injm-ies sustained by claimpt and the class of claimants arising out of violations of statutory,\ncommon law, and constitutional rights.\n1.  SUM M ARY OF CLATM :\nNidia Pelaez, and the class of similarly situated persons (hereinafter ç<clairnants'' collectively),\nbrings this claim for deprivation of consétational, statutory, and common 1aw zights by the City of Los\nAngeles (tçCity'') and various llnlmown persons employed by the City by virtue of acts, policies and\npractices of tlw City. Claimants allege that, in the two years preceding the fling of tllis claim, the\nfollowing:\na)  lrl 2004, the City and the Housing Authority of tie City of Los Angeles ('NACLA'')\ndecide# to reduce the maximtu'n monthly subsidy provided to a family, effectively increasing the rent\nportion to be paid by Section 8 recipients for theiz housing. Under 24 C.F.R. j 982.505(c)(ii),\nhowever, each affected family was required to have been advised, at the first alanual reexnmination\nfollowing the change in policy, that the benefit reduction would not take place until after the recipient's\nsecond armual reexamination (f.c., 'the following year afler the notice). The City uttetly failed to\ncomply with this notification prerequisite.\nb)  Rather tllan providing recipients with cleaz notification that their rent obiigation would\nbe increased the following year, HA CLA mailed a one-page flyer in April 2004 containing the cryptic\nand technical statement that the Housing Authority S%lowered the payment standards used to determine\nyour portion of the rent.'' This flyer had no indicia of an official notice: it was not printed on City or\nHACLA letterhead; it did not specify the legal basis for the action; it did not give a phone number for\ninguiiies; it did not require any aclcnowledgement or signatkue by the recipient; and it did not specify\nany procedure for appealing the admiaistrative decision, M ore importantly, the fiyer did not adviss\nrecipients that their rent obligation would actually be going up, by how much or when. Simply put, the\nfiyer does not compol't with mirlima) standards of due process. uîee, e.g., Golclberg 'p.

As a result claimant and a1l others similitrly sittlated\nreceived illegal rent increases, with littie or no choice but to pay the increase or find alternate housing,\nThis is particularly diffcult for those Section 8 recipients who are the most vulnerable, e.g., elderly,\ndisabled, single-parent families.\nIV.

SUIHM M W  OF CLATM :\nMichael Nozzi, and the class of similarly situated persons (hereinafter ltclrll'mants''\ncollectively), brings this claim for deprivaéon of constitutional, stamtory, arld comrnon law rights by\nthe Housing Authority of the City of Los Amgeles (%SHACLA'') and various nnlcnown persons employed\nby T-IACLA by virtue of acts, policies and practices of HACLA. J.n the two years precedlg the filing of\nthis claim, Claimants allege the following:\n1055 WII..SHIlkE BOULEVARD, SUITE 1 88O LOS ANOELES, CALIFORNIA 9001 7 PHONB: (213) 386-31 14 FAX: (213) 380-4585\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 1   Filed 01/16/07   Page 48 of 58   Page ID #:3712\nNozzi Tort Claim re HACLA\nNovember 15, 2006\nPage 2\na)  I'n 2004, the City of Los Angoles and HACLA decided to reduoe the maxinmm monthly\nsubsidy provided to a fnmily, effectivoly irzcreasing the rent portion to be paid by Section 8 zecipients\nfor their housing. Under 24 C.F.R. j982.505(c)(ii), however, each affected fa=ily was required to\nhave been advised, at the first nnoual reexnmination followicg tl'le change in policy, of the change in\npolicy and that tlle beneft reduction would not take place until afler the recipient's second annual re-\nexnmination (f.c., the foliowing year after the notice). HACT,A utterly failed to comply with this\nnotification prerequisit..\nb)  Rather than providing recipients with clear notification that tlleir rent obligation would\nbe increased the following year, HACLA maGed a one-page Gyer in April 2004 contm'oing the cryptic\nand teclmical statement that the Housing Authority 'Glowered the pam ent staadards used to determine\nyouzportion of the rent.'' This flyer had no indicia of atl ofscial notice: it was not printed on City pr\nHACLA letterhead; it did not specify the legal basis for the action; it did not give a phone n'lrnber for\ninqlliries; it did not reqplire ahy acH owledgement or signature by tlle recipient; and it did not specify\nanyprocedure for appealing the administrative decision, More importantly, the fyer did not advise\nrecipients that ieir rent obligation would actuily be going up, by how much, pr when. Simplyput,\nthe flyer did not comport with minimal standnrds of due process. See, e.g., Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S.\n254 (1970),\nBccause of the failure to comply with the notification requirement for the rent increases either\nalready or to be implm ented from Jttly '05 to June 306, all rept increases imposed on Section 8\nrecipients to date as a result of this admhistrative action,are legally invalid, and will be tbzough the\ncontinuing impact laqting u til Jun.e ,07.\nOn behalf of themselves and a class 9f affected Section 8 recipients that they will seek to\nrmzesent, our clients ask that HACLA:\na) irnrb ediately cease and desist 9om enforcing a deoreased payment standard for all\nSection 8 recipients whose effectike rent increases have taken, or will take, effect dnn'ng\ntlw July 'O5 to Jtme '06 period;\nb)  provide restitution of a11 increased Section 8 payments made by recipients in the past\ntwelve m onths as a result of HACLA'S improper action, and going into the fttture;\nc)  agree in wdting to increase the 'VPS (payment standard) to the earlier @re-2004) levels\neffective immediately (i.e., not phased in through re-exnminations occurzing through\nJuly 7 07),. arld\nd)  pay Claimants' attomeys' fees incun'ed to date.\n688 1:5 M.2 Ciient: 1459\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00380-PA-FFM   Document 1   Filed 01/16/07   Page 49 of 58   Page ID #:3713\nNozzi Tort Claim re HACLA\nNovember 15, 2006\nPage 3\nI1.

The Court orders the following injunctive relief for a three-year period:\n2 a. In any future notices to Section 8 tenants, related to the reduction of the\n3 VPS, HACLA shall simply and plainly communicate the information\n4 provided in non-technical, language that would be reasonably\n5 understandable to Section 8 tenants, at a language level commensurate\n6 with the average educational level of Section 8 tenants.

Any notice within the next three years regarding reduction of the VPS\n10 shall be provided to Class Counsel before it is sent, and shall be subject\n11 to the approval of Class Counsel before it is communicated to Section 8\n12 tenants, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. \n13 c.  When communicating any new notices to tenants (other than a notice of\n14 reduction of VPS to which ¶ 72(a) of the Settlement Agreement\n15 applies), HACLA will use language reasonably understandable to\n16 Section 8 tenants.  For purposes of this Agreement, the Parties agree\n17 that existing notices that have been historically sent regularly to tenants\n18 without challenge, such as the RE 38 notice, notices sent to tenants\n19 when HACLA approves a rent increase requested by the landlord, and\n20 notices when there is a bedroom downsizing, meet this standard.\n21 7.
