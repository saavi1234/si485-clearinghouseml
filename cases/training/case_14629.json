The memorandum is replete with elaborate\n97(cid:9)\nI\nrhetoric_  which appears to us to bear little relation to\n28(cid:9)\n29\n30 See, for example, subject headings, sucli as \"The Phillips\n0 incident eisproves plaintiff's whole case\" and \"filth-iour\n31(cid:9)\n'witnesses, ''ormer Tan -emnloyjes, intervie,•ed by_the_\nJprc)c :here —as no pattern Cr practice of diecriminatien\"\n32(cid:9)\n1 this reference being to persons whom defendants could have\ne-4.tnesses.\nnot c211(cid:9)\nd14 \n\n1 the facts of the case. Singe--the Court had an opportunity\n2\nto hear the witnesses at a lengthy trial, and since\n3\nplaintiff's basic contentions are set forth in our\n4\npreviously filed Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions\n5\nof Law, we do not now present anything purporting to be\nan exhaustive analysis of evidence with which the Court\n7\n8 is already familiar. We confine ourselves, instead, to\n9 rebutting a number of important, factual and legal themes\n10\npresented by defendants in their brief.\n11\n1. Defendants' attack on the testimon y of the \n12\n\"inside witnesses.\"\n13\nIn the final analysis, the question whether\n14\ndefendants, by Mrs. Boatwright, gave discriminatory\n15\n16 instructions, or made admissions of a racially discriminatory\nLinda Tappan, Lynette Watkinz, Marjorie Dwyer,\n18\nBetty Summers and Kenneth Romines must turn on the Court's\n19\nassessment of credibility. Since much of that determination\n20\ndepends on the Court's appraisal of demeanor, there is\n21\nonly a limited amount that can be said about this\n22\nissue. Nevertheless, we believe that defendants' lengthy\n23\n24 1 denunciation of alleged inconsistencies and bias is\n25\nsomewhat overdrawn, and misses the central consistency\n26\nof the insiders' accounts.\n27\nIt is true that there are some variations between\n28\n1\nthese witnesses as to what was said, when and where.\n29\nThis,however, is a natural failing of :i_tnesses. /,.Then\n30\n31 ten persons witness an accident at whic\":1 an automobile\n32 !strikes a pedestrian, there are likely to be ten\n1\n1\n\n1 different descriptions of the—car, the driver, the\n2\npedestrian, the lighting, the speed at which the driver\n3\nwas travelling, and the length of time the transaction\n4\nlasted. But one thing common to all of the witnesses\n5\nwill be their recollection that the automobile hit\nthe driver.\n8 So it was here. While recollection of a few\n9\nindividual transactions varied, each of plaintiff's\n10\n\"inside\" witnesses recalled, plainly and unequivocally,\n11\nthat Mrs. Boatwright ordered or acknowledged racial\n12\ndiscrimination to them. Defendants' star witness,\n13\nMrs. Colston, also testified that, Mrs. Boatwright lumped\n14\nNegroes among the undesirables. In general, the practices\n15\n16 described by the \"inside\" witnesses coincide with the\n17\n!experiences of the bona fide applicants and the testers\n18\nin terms of both misrepresentation of unavailability and\n19\nthe use of \"credit checks\" to deter and discourage\n20\nblacks. Moreover, at the time of these events, there\n21\nwere no black tenants at the Americana. We submit that\n22\n23 to hold in defendant's favor on the basic issue of an\n24 exclusionary policy at the Americana, the Court would\n25\nhave to find that the five insiders all fabricated\n26\nMrs. Boatwright's racial discrimination. We do not think\n27\nsuch a finding is compatible with the evidence.\n28\nDefendants also make much of these witnesses'\n29\nalleged bias, and it does appear that some of them may\n:30\n31 not have been ardent admirers of Mrs. Boatwright.\n32\nIndeed, there may well have been reason for this. It\n1 --\n\n1\nshould be recalled, however,---that these witnesses are\nnot complainants to the Government; their experiences\n3\ncame to plaintiff's attention when their identities\n4\nwere disclosed by pretrial discovery and they were\n5\ninterviewed by the FBI. There is no suggestion that they\n6\nare volunteers who testified out of spite, and we submit\n7\n8 that their demeanor at trial belied any such suggestion.\n9 Moreover, a number of defendants' attributions of bias\n.10\nare one-sided, to say the least. At page 13 of their\n11\nbrief, defendants purport to use Lynette Watkins'\n12\nnegative reaction to a proposed line of questioning by\n13\ncounsel for defendant which this Court ruled to be\n14\nhighly improper, to argue that her testimony is\n15\n16 incredible because of bias.\n17 Defendants also Claim that the insider testi.mony\n18\nwas contradicted by other former employees who\n19\ntestified that they received no discriminatory\n20\ninstructions. A more objective description of this\n21\ntestimony would have revealed that these witnesses were\n22\nnot employed at the Americana at the time plaintiff's\n23\n24 witnesses were there.–\n25\n26\nDT-TV-73-7Q; VT -11 -1 and D. Exh. AP, at\npp. 3-4.\n27\n28 4/1141/1111/111\n29 111111/1/1111/\n301\n.111/11/1/111!!\n31(cid:9)\n1111111/1/1111\n32\n- 4 -\n\n2. The Former Employees and Post-Suit Testers \n1\n2 Who Did Not Testify.\n3\nIt was stipulated that in preparation for trial,\nthe United States interviewed 59 former employees of Tan\n5\n(RT-V-24-25). It was not stipulated that this number\n6\nconstituted the total number of Tan's former employees,\nwhich it did not. The United States introduced the\n8\n*/\n9 testimony of eight of these former employees  at\n10\ntrial to prove discrimination by defendants. By a conjuring\n11\ntrick worthy of Houdini, defendants now claim that since\n12\n13\n14\n*/ Linda Tappan, Lynette Watkins, Marjorie Dwyer,\n15\nLupine Tatum, Kenneth Romines, (RT-I-l), Betty\n16 Sumners, Harold Milner (RT-II-i); and Kathryn\nHambley (RT-III-337-338).\n17\n//////////////4\n18\n//////////////\n19\n//////////////\n20\n/////////////\n21\n22 ///////////////\n23\n///////////////\n24\n///////////////\n25\n///////////////\n26\n////////////;//\n27\n//////////////\n28\n/////////////\n29\n30 /////////////\n31\n/////////////\n32\n/////////////\n\n1 plaintiff did not call the remaining 51 witnesses,*/ the\ninference is to be drawn that such witnesses would\n3\nnecessarily have testified that no discrimination occurred.\n4\nBut nothing has been stipulated as to what the\n5\ntestimony of these witnesses would have been, and they\n6\nwere at least as available to the defendants as they were\n7\n8 to the United States. In fact, a witness of this kind\n9 would ordinarily have every reason to testify in favor\n10\nof defendants, for if there was discrimination, he may\n11\nhave been implicated and therefore reluctant to admit\n12\nit, while if there was no discrimination, he has every\n13\nreason to testify enthusiastically. A former employee\n14\n15 is therefore more naturally a witness for defendants than\n16 for plaintiff. For this reason, almost any defendant in a\n17\ncivil rignts case is in a position to present his own\n18\ntestimony or that of his agents denying any unlawful\n19\nconduct. Such denials are therefore greeted with a certain\n20\ndegree of skepticism where statistical or other evidence\n21\nmakes out a prima facie case of discrimination.

(cid:9) Under these\n25\ncircumstances, we believe it would be unreasonable to\n26\nlinfer from the failure of both parties to call certain\n27\n28\n*/ Defendants go further and say fifty-four, not fifty-one,\n29\nwitnesses are inferentially favorable to them.

With\n7\n8 the exception of one test!!../ by a black - white team\n9 at Tan Manor in July 1971, which was proved by the\n10 *lc /\nUnited States, there was no other competent__ evidence\n11\non post-suit tests. Defendants rely on written testing\n12\nreports, but since they could have but did not call the\n13\ntesters to the stand, plaintiff had no opportunity to\n14\n15 cross-examine. Consequently, the facts were not\n16\nestablished in accordance with the traditional adversary\n17\nsystem, and defendants row precent 7-re hear-ay and ask\n18 **/\nits acceptance as proof of compliance.\n19\n20\n*/ \nSee the testimony of Joe Ellen Murphy and Pam Wimberly\n21\nconcerning their dissimilar experience concerning\n22 availability at Tan Manor.

These testers can be\n5\ndivided into four groups (i.e., (1) Gross-Johnson visits;\n6\n(2) Brandt-Smith-McCullen visits; (3) Murphy-Wimberly visit;\n7\nand (4) the Bredt-Evans visit). Except for some discussion\n8\n9 in the appendices=/, however, we confine ourselves here to\n10 the experiences of the first of these four pairs.\n11\nGross and Johnson visited eight of Tan's buildings.\n12\nWhile the Government established by these witnesses that\n13\ndefendants, through their managers and agents, used their\n14\n\"credit check\" ruse to discourage black prospects from these\n15\n16 buildings, this evidence was offered to prove discriminatory,\n17 ImisrepresPntati.ons of un•availability at on ly(cid:9) e° Tan\n18\nbuildings (Tan Village, Tan House, and Tan Plaza Inter-\n19\nnational).

On the contrary, the case is\n17(cid:9) based in large part en the testimony of \"insid- witnesses\"\n18\nand a few bona fide applicants, and the auditors' experiences\n19\nare not the wrong for which suit was brought, but merely\n20\n(cid:9) evidence of defendant's discriminatory practices. With\n21\n(cid:9) respect to the second proposition, this action was instituted\n22\niby the United States on behalf of its citizens, and with\nl\n23(cid:9)\n24(cid:9) particular reference to actual and prospective victims of\n25(cid:9) i discrimination. The \"testers\" or \"auditors\" are not pro-\n26\nspective beneficiaries of the suit, but have provided\n.27\nevidence which is designed to assist other persons to obtain\n28\n(cid:9) their rights.\n29\nThe authorities cited in our pro posed Concl/Asions\n30(cid:9)\nof Law 12 through 14 conclusively establish that the '',J,a\n31.(cid:9) . \n32(cid:9) fide\" requirent rpplies only to discriminatory refu1s\n1\n4 -\n\nto sell or rent.\n1\n2 The legislative history conforms to the foregoing.\n3\nDuring the debates on the Senate Floor regarding the enact-\n4\nment of Title VIII, Senator Allott offered the following\n5\namendment (No. 544) to what is now Section 3604(a) of the\n6\nAct:\n7\nafter the word 'rent' insert the\n8\nfollowing: After the making of\n9 a bona fide offer, or.*/\n10 In arguing for the adoption of his amendment, Senator Allott\n11\noffered the following explanation regarding its purpose and\n12\nscope:\n13\nMr. President, this amendment is\n14 applicable to page 11, line 7. In\nessence, it would make the penalty\n15\nprovisions of the proposed legisla-\n16 tion applicable only where there is\na refusal to sell or rent after a\n17 bona fide offer has been made. **/\n18\nIn response to an inquiry by a fellow Senator concern-\n19\ning its scope of operation, Senator Allott stated that:\n20\n. . .

The fact that\n4\nthey did not do SO indicates an intention to give it limited\n5\napplication.\n6\nDefendants, while acknowledging that Dubose v. Corey\n7\nRealty Company, No. 69-C-422 (N.D. Ill. 1969) construes the\n8\n9 \"bona fide\" requirement as did Senator Allott, suggest that\n10 United States v. Gilman, 341 F. Supp. 891 (S.D. N.Y. 1972)\n11\nis to the contrary. A reading of that case refutes defen-\n12\ndants' claim. Judge Levet, while observing that the\n13\nauditors in Gilman represented. : themselves to be bona fide\n14\napplicants, admitted extensive evidence of \"auditing,\" but\n15\nfound with respect to the incident to which defendants here •\n16\n17 allude that no discriminatory misrepresentation of avail-\n18\nability was made. There is nothing in the opinion suggest-\n19\ning that the\"bona fide\" requirement should be read into any\n20\nportion of the statute other than the portion in which it\n21\nwas inserted.\n22\nThe legislative history cited by defendants discloses\n23\n24(cid:9) that members of Congress were concerned -- and understand-\n'\n95\nably so(cid:9) that \"phony\" plaintiffs who might be \"on a lark -\n*/\n26\nIH or whatever,\" or engaged in \"agitation for aRitation's\n27 **/\nsake\" — should not be able to bring contrived suits and\n28\n(cid:9) recover damages for injuries to them which are entirely\n29\n(cid:9)\n30\n*/ See, e. g.. the remarks of Senator Mondale, 114 Cong.

Since equity looks to the future, he is\n12\nentitled to injunctive relief if he shows significant past\n13\nviolations, or, in the absence of past violations, if he\n14\nshows a threat or likelihood of future unlawful conduct.\n15\nSwift & Co. v.

Even if the discriminatory treatment of\n20\ntesters were not itself a violation of the Act, it would\n21\nstill be admissible as bearing on how defendants are likely\n92\nto conduct themselves vis-a-vis bo-.,a fide applicants,\n23(cid:9) ji\ncf. \n24(cid:9) United States v.

The \"Clean Hands\" Defense.\n2 Defendants apparently contend that the United States\n3\nforfeited any right to equitable relief by failing to\n4\nnegotiate with them prior to filing suit and by failing to\n5\nenter into an out-of-court agreement with them after suit\n6\nwas brought. We think that plaintiff acted properly and\n7\n8 that there is no authority to support defendants'\n9 contentions.\n10\nUnder defendants' \"clean hands\" argument the\n11\nUnited States would not be entitled to relief even if\n12\nit proved a pattern or practice of racial discrimination,\n13\nor the denial of rights to a group of persons raising the\n14\nissue of general public importance as required by\n15\n16 42 U.S.C. 3613. Under their theory, the right of blacks to\n17 live on a nondiscriminatory basis at various Tan apartment\n18\nbuildings would depend on matters quite extraneous to the\n19\ndefendants' practices. This is a proposition which we\n20\ndo not think a court could lightly accept, at least in\n21\nthe absence of the most serious misconduct on plaintiff's\n22\n23 part. As the court stated in United States v. Board of\n24 Educations of Lincoln County, 295 F. Supp. 1041, 1042\n25\n(S.D. Ca. 1968):\n26\nWhile the general principles of\n27 equity apply to actions prougnt\nby the United States 'they will\n28 not be applied to frustrate the\npurpose of its laws or to thwart\n29\npublic policy'.

Supp. 529 (D.Md. 1971), on\n7\nwhich defendants rely.\n8\nBut, in any event, there has been no improper\n9\nconduct by the United States. There are, indeed, statutes\n10\nwhich do require notice to defendants prior to suit.\n11(cid:9)\nFor example, 42 U.S.C. 2000 C - 6 permits\n12(cid:9)\nsuits by the Attorney General to desegregate school\n13(cid:9)\n14(cid:9) systems only after a statutory notice has been given to\n15\nthe school authorities. But the Fair Housing Act contains\n16\nno such provision. Accordingly, Congress has vested in\n17\nthe Attorney General discretion whether to write a letter\n18\nand negotiate for an agreement, or to bring suit and seek\n19\n20(cid:9) an injunction (by litigation or by consent), and left the\n21(cid:9) determination whether an injunction is proper to the court.\n22(cid:9)\nIn the instant case, the record reveals that the\n1 \n23\ndefendants had received at least three known housing\n1 \n24\ndiscrimination complaints by black apartment seekers\n25\nsince 1967.*/(cid:9) Nevertheless, years later, blacks were still\n26\n27\n28(cid:9) 1F_PC complaint by Cottons. in 1967 (RT-V-23-24) ; private\n;4\"/ -\n-\"Suit by Fitch in 1970 (7T-II-10); HUD complaint by 2.:iss\n29(cid:9) 'DuBrossac in 1971 (RT-V-13)..\n////////11///1/10/\n30\n1\n31.////////////////////\n1////1/WW/i////!\n- 17 -\n\n1 being subjected to discrimination, and the United States\n2 therefore sued.\n3\nDefendants also contend that the conciliation\n4\nrequirements of 42 U.S.C. 3610 should apply to suits\n5\nby the Attorney General.

This proposition misstates the governing\n9 law.\n10\nThe civil rights laws are directed to practices with\n11\ndiscriminatory consequences, without regard to defendants'\n12\nmotivation. See our proposed Conclusion of Law No. 10, and\n13\nCarmical v. Craven, 451 F. 2d 399 (9th Cir. 1971). The\n14\n15 statute prohibits thoughtless, as well as intentional denials\n10 of equal opportunity, and the duty to comply with the Act\n17\nhac been held to be nondelegable. See our proposed Con-\n18\nclusion of Law No. 7. Defendants, at page 161, cite two\n19\ndecisions under the fair employment law to support an\n20\n\"intent\" requirement in this case, but intent is explicitly\n21\nincluded in the language of the employment statute,– while\n22\n23 the Fair Housing Act contains no reference to it at all.\n24\n25\n*/ Even the exalicit intent requirement in Title VII does\n26 not recuire evil motivation.

This distinction is hardly plausible\n4\nin the context of Mrs. Boatwright at the Americana. The\n5\ndiscrimination alleged consists of racially based misrep-\n8\nresentations of unavailability and of discouragement of\n7\nblacks through the racially selective credit check ruse.\n9 Mrs. Boatwright had sufficient autonomy not only to dis-\n10\ncriminate in the respects indicated, but to instruct\n11\nseveral subordinates to do so as well. That, without more,\n12\nis a pattern or practice of discrimination, United States v.\n13\nReddoch, supra, Conclusion of Law No.. 13, and a group denial\n14\nof rights, id, Conclusion of Law No. 15; United States v.\n15\n16.

This contention leaves unanswered the cases\n25\nexpressly holding that the Attorney General's determination\n26\nof general public importance is not subject to judicial\n27 \nZven assuiiiing that this Court would or sliould\n28\never review the Attorney General's determination, we do not\n29\nthink it: should overturn that determination in the first\n30\n:i\n32\n4 S0(cid:9)ee(cid:9) our ProposeCodnCclnuslico0.n  1in 0'(cid:9)1L.a w \"N(cid:9)o. 2200.\n- 20 -\n\n1 pattern or practice housing suit to go to trial in California\n2 which involves a major apartment company, in which the use\n3\nof \"testing\" evidence has been so energetically challenged,\n4\nin which the nondelegability of the duty to comply with the\n5\nAct is placed in question, in which issue has been joined\n6\nas to the inferences to be drawn by the parties' failure\n7\nto call former employees as witnesses, and in which the\n8\n9 relevancy of statistics, employment practices, and many\n10\nother facts is in dispute.\n11\nDefendants next contend that the proof insufficiently\n12\nidentifies the \"group of persons\" whose rights were denied.\n13\nIn United States v. Hunter, 459 F. 2d 205, 218, note 17\n14\n(4th Cir. 1972), there was no evidence that identifiable\n15\n16 blacks had even read the discriminatory advertisements\n17 in question, but a group denial of rights was found.\n18\nSimilarly, in United States v. Real Estate Dev. Corn., 347\n19\nF. Supp. 776, 785 (N.D.

Two former custodial employees of\n24(cid:9)\nii\n25 • defendants (Harold Milner, RT-II-167-163, and Lupine Tatum,\n(cid:9)\n26\nsee Pl. Exh. 4E), have testified that it only took about\n27\n'two h• ours to clean a vacated apartment for a new tenant.\n4\n28\n29\n*/ See Pl aintiff's E7T.hi.h4 t No. 9, M2r'ornnd= dated Sept. 17,\n30\n11968, from Mr. Tan to all of his apartment managers.\n31\n**/ See Plaintiff's E::hihit No. 1 (A-4), weekly reports for\nD.2combr 27, 1970 ;. :rid Jury 10, 1971.\nit\n\nDefendants' testimony on this point is conflicting. While\n1\n2 Nr. Zee testified at trial that extensive cleaning and\n3\npreparation (i.e. drapes, rugs, painting, etc.) which took\n4\nabout 1 week were necessary to get an apartment ready for\n5\noccupancy, it was the defendants' announced policy, at least\n6\nsince 1968, to accommodate rental applicants desiring an\n7\nimmediate vacancy by having the manager clean the apartment\n8\n9 immediately. If the manager's maintenance staff was in-\n10 sufficient to get the job done, he was to contact the\n11\ncentral office for help. It was also defendants' policy\n12\nto retain professional apartment cleaners to perform the\n13\nwork if defendants were short of maintenance help at the\n14\ntime. While it was customary for draperies to be cleaned\n15\nwithin one day, defendants instructed their managers to\n16\n17 keep an extra set of drapes for immediate installation.\n18\nIn addition it was also defendants' practice to charge a\n19\nlarge cleaning deposit so as to induce the tenant to leave\n20\na clean apartment on termination of his tenancy.

Under these-circumstances, we believe that\n2 the court should reject defendants' contention that vacancy\n3\nwas not the equivalent of availability, and find that\n4\ndefendants made a racial misrepresentation to Mr. Johnson\n5\nas to the availability of an apartment at Tan Village.\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\nA 3\n11\n\nAPPENDIX \"B'\n1 Pamela Wimberly and Jo Ellen Murphy Test \n2 On July 14, 1971, -at'about 3:15 p.m., Mrs. Pamela\n3\nWimberly, a black \"tester\" for MCFH, went to Tan Manor and,\n4\nupon noticing an \"apartment for rent\" sign in front of the\n5\n4 apartment building, went inside and inquired about the\n4 6\navailability of a one or two bedroom apartment for rent.\n7\nThe manager, Mrs. White, told Mrs. Wimberly that the complex\n9 contained only studio apartments. When Mrs. Wimberly asked-\n10\nwhether a studio was available, Mrs. White told her that she\n11\ncould not say, because she never knew when anybody was leav-\n12\ning the complex. Mrs. Wimberly took this statement to mean\n13\nthat there were no current vacancies at the complex, RT(II)\n14\n270-273; see also Defendants' Exhibit No. AS, at pp. 25-26,\n15\n16 42-43. Although Mrs. Wimberly asked to see a studio apart-\n17 ment she was not shown one.\n18\nAbout forty-five minutes later, Mrs. Jo Ellen Murphy,\n19\na white \"tester\" for MCFH, also went to Tan Manor and in-\n20\nquired about the availability of an apartment. Mrs.\n21\nshowed Mrs. Murphy three studio apartments and told her that\n22\n23 she could move in ilullediately RT(II) 242-245.\n24 Mrs. White acknowledged that she may have told Yrs.\n25 Murphy that the apartment was available for rental at the\n• 26\ntime. In addition, defendants' own business records reveal\n27\nt\n11,, e::ist2nce of 10 vacant studio apartments (9 furnished\n28\nand 1 unfurnished) and 4 unfurnished studio apartments to\n29\n30 become vacant by August 14, 1971. \n31\n1\nMI\n\nAPPENDIX \"C\"\nOpposition to Defendants' Motions to Strike \nDefendants have moved,to strike certain testimony\n3\nof Arthur McCullen and Phillip Smith relating to their\n4\nvisits to the Americana on the alleged ground that no\n5\nproper foundation was laid in either instance for using\n6\nthe audit reports they wrote up immediately after visiting\n7(cid:9)\n8(cid:9) the complex. We oppose the motion.\n9(cid:9) Since the trial judge, especially in a non-jury trial,.\n10\nis in a position to insure that the written memoranda used\n11\nfor refreshment of memory is actually used to revive a\n12\npresent recollection and not for any ulterior purpose, the\n13\ncourts have held that the use of such writings lies in the\n14\n15(cid:9) sound discretion of the trial judge. See United States v.\n16(cid:9) Socony Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 233 (1939). In the\n17\npresent case. McCullen related that he went to the\n18\nAmericana on January 6, 1971, and asked the manager, Mrs.\n19\nBoatwright, whether there were any one-bedroom apartments\n20\navailable. After being shown an apartment, he testified\n21\nthat Mrs. Boatwright quoted a rental price of $200 per\n22(cid:9)\n23(cid:9) month and told McCullen of other matters pertaining to the\n24(cid:9)\napplication procedure at the complex. (Plaintiff's Exhibit\n25 4(c) RTAM 8-10, 13). However, when asked what portion of\n26\nthe deposit was refundable, McCullen testified that he\n27\nrecalled discussing the subject with the manager, but could\n28\nnot recall the exact amount. In an effort to refresh\n29(cid:9)\n30(cid:9) McCullen's recollection, counsel for plaintiff asked him\n'wheth-r -nd 1:hen he made .cny notes concerning his experiences\n:12\n!at the complex. McCullen responded that he wrote his\n• I\n\nnotes —(cid:9) up immediately after leaving the complex.(cid:9) When\n1\n2 asked whether it would refresh his recollection to examine\n3 his notes, McCullen responded that it would. (cid:9) After McCullen\n4\nconfirmed the accuracy and the authenticity of the notes,\n5\ncounsel asked him whether he could not answer the question\nconcerning the refundable portion of the deposit (Plaintiff's\nExhibit 4(c), RTAM 12).(cid:9) After examining his notes to refresh\n8\n9 his recollection, McCullen testified that he was told he\n**/\n10 would have $160 returned to him:—(cid:9)McCullen also related\n11\nthat he was told by Mrs. Boatwright that an application\n12\nwould be necessary, so that the management could make a\n13\ncredit check on him.(cid:9) However, when asked about other aspects\n14\nof the application procedure, McCullen indicated that he\n15\n16 did not recall the specifics.(cid:9) When allowed to refresh his\n17 recollection by exonining his notes, MeCullen stated that\n18\nhe was told that he could not move in before the applica-\n***/\n19\ntion was processed ---(cid:9) (Plaintiff's Exhibit 4(c), RTAM 15).\n20\nCommon sense dictates, and the law requires that\n21\nwitnesses be allowed to refresh their recollections from\n22\n23\n24\n25\n*/ The notes for the Americana are contained in an audit\nreport which can be found with the deposition of McCullen\n•26\n(see Plaintiff's Exhibit 4(c)).\n27\n**/ The two white testers (Brandt and S72ith) who went to\n2s the Americana on the same day, were 'quoted a $160 deposit\namount by Mrs. Boatwright and told that they could expect\n29\nto have $110 refunded to them.\n30\nAk/ The two white testers (Brandt and Smith) were told that\n31 a credit check would not be necessary.\nC - 2\n\n1 memoranda on matters of detail. — It defies reason to suggest\n2 that a man who wrote something down contemporaneously to\n3 assure accuracy should not be allowed to look at what he\n4\nwrote when he is testifying under oath about details of\n5\nthe transaction months and even years later. Since counsel\n6\ninspected the notes and cross-examined the witness upon\n7\nthe subject matter contained therein, all of the ordinary\n8\n9 safeguards against any claimed unfairness in the use of\n10 the writing were fully satisfied. Moreover, since no jury\n11\nwas involved, the court can consider any questions of\n12\nreliability of the testimony and accord it whatever weight\n13 **/\nis appropriate. The evidence here is consistent with\n14\n*/\nthat adduced by other testers.\n15\n16(cid:9) The objection as to Phillip Smith is similar. Mr.\n17 Hz-Thiii.:1 testified that he went to the Americana on January 6.\n18\n1971, and upon inquiring about apartment vacancies, was    \n19 \n20 */ It should further be noted that the witness was not\nexamining notes involving a complex narrative, but a simple\n21 form type document. After looking over the report on both\noccasions, McCullen was able to answer the questions.\n22 \n23(cid:9) **/ Both the case law and statutory law permit the use of\niwritines of the tyoe utilined in the present case.

When asked\n5\nabout the amount of the deposit and the refundable portion,\n6\nSmith stated that he had no present recollection. Counsel\n7\n**/\nfor plaintiff thereupon handed the audit report — to\n8(cid:9)\n9(cid:9) Smith and asked him whether it refreshed his recollection.\n10(cid:9)\nAfter examining the report, Smith testified that he was\n11\nquoted a rental deposit of $150 of which $110 would be\n12\nrefundable (Plaintiff's Exhibt 4(b) RTPS 27. Smith did not,\n13\nhowever, as defendants claim, use the audit report when\n14\nanswering the Government's question concerning when the\n15(cid:9)\n16(cid:9) apartment was available. As previously mentioned, Smith's\n17(cid:9)\ntestimony on this subject came from his own independent\n18\nrecollection (Plaintiff's Exhibit 4(b) RTPS 13-14, 17, 22).\n19\nFurthermore, the truthfulness of Smith's testimony is\n20\ncorroborated by the testimony of the other white tester\n21\n(Brandt) who related an experience virtually identical to\n22(cid:9)\n***/\n23(cid:9) that of his own. Accordingly, any claimed lack of founda-\n24(cid:9) tion for the admission of Smith's testimony relative to\n25\ncurrant availability of the apartment, is a red herring in\n26\nthe context of this case.\nI\n27\n*/ Smith was testifying from his own independent recollec-\nj\n(cid:9)  at this point.\n29(cid:9)\n30(cid:9) !**/ Smith testified nat. ho recorded his caperiences at\nthe complex immediately after leaving the apartment office\n3\t\n'and that(cid:9) info=ltin in the rno - t 17as trt!e(cid:9) that it\n,.\n'was an accurate record of the re ort (see Plaintiff's\np\na.xaiDit 40), i:TPS 16-21).\n***/ See Plaintiff's Exhibit 4(a), RTWB 12-13, 16-17.\nC-4\n$1 1.11INTI4C; 111.111•/.(cid:9) I•...• •\n\nWilli= Brandt \n2 Defendants object to testimony by William Brandt\n3 that one of defendants' managers made an extrajudicial ad-\n4\nmission of a discriminatory policy to him in 1970.

The Government's com-\n3\nplaint prays for injunctive and affirmative relief. In their\n4\nanswer, the defendants denied the material allegations of the\n'\n5\n17-21 and July 31-\ncomplaint. Trial was held on July \n6\nAugust 3, 1972. On the basis of the evidence adduced at\n7\ntrial, and purses ent to Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, the Court now makes the following Findings of\nFact and Conclusions of Law:\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Defendants \ne defendant Tan Construction Company is owned\nIrl,  \nand operated by the defendant T. S. Tan (hereinafter \"Tan\"\nor defendants). Tan operates and owns in whole or in part\n11 apartment buildings in and near the City of Palo Alto,\nCalifornia containing 1133 rental units.  The first of\n!/\nthese buildings began operations in 1959 and others have been\nopened (.1t various times since then.\n2. The rental of the apartments ranges from $120\nper month for an unfurnished one-bedroom apartment to far\nhigher amounts for larger and more luxurious units. (See\nPlaintiff's Exhibit 5.) At the time of the filing of this\n27\nInformation relative to the name, location and number of\n28 units at each apartment complex, the types of bedroom\naccommodations, rental price range and security deposit\n29\nbuildings began operation, the number\nrequirements, when the \nof blacks at the building all-the time of suit and where_\n30\napplicable, the date of the first black tenant at the build-\n31 ing, is set forth in Appendix \"A\" to these findings.\n32\n- 2 -\nU. ti.(I11%•1(cid:9)NI 1•IIIN I INt.(cid:9) p It(cid:9) i ..•■(cid:9) got\n\naction, six of Tan's buildings had no black occupants and\n1\n2 had never had any. One of those six vas the Americana,\n3\nwhich opened in October 1969 with 286 units and by the time\n4\nof the suit had 486 units available for occupancy (though\n5\nother parts of the complex were in various stages of con-\n6\nstruction). As of June 1971, when this action was filed,\n7\nTan's other five buildings contained 14 units occupied by\n8\n9 black persons, these units representing 1.2% of the 1133 in\n10 all of Tan's buildings. However, 11 of the above 14 units\n11\nwere located in three buildings (two large and one small)\n12\nnear East Palo Alto which contains the only concentrated\n13\nblackresidentia-1:areaV in the locality served by Tan's\n14\nbuildings. (Se -laintiff's Exhibit 5 and Defendants'\n15\nExhibit L.)\n1G\n17 3. Each of defendants' apartment buildings is op-\n18\nerated by a reisident manager, most of whom are helped out\n19\nby relief managers on their days off. Two of the buildings\n20\nhave assistant managers (Americana and Tan Village.) The\n21\nti\nresident managers report to Tan's central office in Palo\n22\nAlto and their immediate superior is Mr. Zee, 11 the defen-\n23\n24 dants' general property manager. Mr. Zee has held this\n25 position since 1968. (RT II - 109) All of the resident\n26\nmanagers and other persons employed to assist in the tenant\n27\napplication process have been white persons. (P1. Ex. 5, p.19)\n2S\n29\n*/ See Plaintiff's Exhibit 6 and 6-A.\n30\nV*/ Mr. Tan retained his supervisory responsibility over the\n31 resident manager of the Ameficana (See testimony of Mr. Zee.)\n32\n1■•\n(cs.tAWD-lit.AWNTI.MIVIM;OFMA:71.11.1io-VH-tM\n\nts\n4. Mrs. Louise Boatwright was the resident manager\n1\n2 at the defendants' Americana complex between October 1969\n3 and April 1971. Previously she had held this position at\n4\nSunshine Gardens from October 1965 to March 1966, at Tan\n5\nManor from March 1966 to October 1969 and at Tan Village\n6\nfrom May 1971 to September 1971. Mrs. Boatwright was ini-\n7\ntially hired by Mr. Tan. Unlike, the rest of defendants'\n8\napartment complexes the Americana employs \"rental agents\"\n9\n10 who work under the supervision of the resident manager and\n11\nwhose job is to show prospective tenants around the complex\n12\nand present those interested'in application to the resident\n13\nmanager for processing (RT-I-79; RT-II-39).\n14\n5. At 0-- trial, four of Tan's former employees who\n15\nhad worked at the Americana complex during the time Mrs.\n16\n17 Boatwright was the resident manager, testified that Mrs.\n4\n18 Boatwright had instructed them to discriminate against black\n19\npersons and members of other minority groups in the rental'\n20\nof apartments at the complex; and had made a number of\n21\nstatements indicating that it was defendants' policy and\n22\ndisposition to avoid renting to black tenants.\n23\n24 6. Specifically, Linda Tappan testified that on one\nA1 25 occasion Mrs. Boatwright told her that \"we don't rent to\n26\ncolored\"; that, at a meeting of rental agents, Mrs. Boatwright\n27\nstated that it was the defendants' policy not to rent apart-\n28\nments to black persons or Mexican-Americans because they\n29\nwere undesirable tenants an that Mrs. Boatwright at this\n30\nmeeting suggested vays'inlich such minority applicants\n31\n32   could be discouraged from renting. (e.g. show them the more\n- 4 -\nS, 1:11VrI1N0.11:14 f 11111101111411 104'1,11•1' 7 1.11•11 11 - :114.4011\n\n1 expensive apartments, give a less complete tour of the\n2 eomplex, and misrepresent the availability of apartments).\n3\nIn addition, Mrs. Tappan testified that as a means of\n4\ninsuring the implementation of the defendants' discrimina-\n5\ntory policy, Mrs. Boatwright told the rental agents that\n6\nthey would not receive a commission for renting to a\n7\n*/\nblack or other minority person (RT-I-2-10, 23, 38, 62).–*\n8\n9 Mrs. Tappan was a credible witness.\n10\n7. Miss Lynette Watkins testified that Mrs. Boat-\n11\nwright admonished her on one occasion for showing apart-\n12\nments to a black person; that Mrs. Boatwright explained\n13\nto Miss Watkins that it was the policy of the defendants\n14\nnot to rent to black persons because of their race and\n15\n16 that the entry of black tenants would conflict with\n17 efforts po attract(cid:9) .air,tain a high-class, white\n18\nclientele at the Americana; that Mrs. Boatwright instructed\n19\nMiss Watkins to implement this policy by various devices\n20\nto discdurage minority applicants; (e.g. emphasizing the\n21\nhigh rental rates, the amount of deposit, credit checks,\n22\n23 and giving limited tours of the complex) RT-I-98-102;\n24 that the assistant manager of the Americana was present\n25\non one occasion when these policies were related and later\n26\nconfirmed them to Miss Watkins; (RT-I-104, 105, 109, 123,\n27\n153-154) and that Mrs. Boatwright advised Miss Watkins\n28\nthat black persons were not hired at the Americana except\n29\nin menial jobs. (RT-I-105, - 107-108). While defendants\n30\n31\n*/ RT-I refers to volume(cid:9) of the Reporter's Transcript\nI\n32\nof the trial.\n- 5\nIf.S.COVEIMM.14ENtINTIM:tIVIACV:Viwtio--,1217-94,1\n\ns\nmade an intensive attack on Miss Watkins' credibility,\n2 the Court finds her to be a credible witness.\n3\n8. Mrs, Betty Summers testified that Mrs. Boat-\n4\nwright said that blacks were to be shown around the\n5\ncomplex and treated with courtesy, but that when the\n6\nquestion of rental application arose Mrs. Summers was to\n7\ntell the black prospect that it would take two weeks to\n8\n3\n9 make a credit check on his or her application. Mrs.\n10 Sumthers further testified that she was not told to give\n11\nsimilar information to white applicants (RT-1I-25-27, 48);\n12\nthat in her experience at the complex, the apartment manage-\n13\nment did not check the references of white applicants;\n14\nand that she was told by Mrs. Boatwright that she preferred\n15\n16 shite tenants at the Americana and hoped it would stay\n17 that way (all-white) (RT-I1-27-29, 37). Mrs. Summers\n18\nwas a credible witness.\n19\n9. Mrs. Marjorie Dwyer; another former rental\n20\nagent, testified that on her first day of work she asked\n2]\nMrs. Boatwright about the Americana's racial policies and\n22\n23 that Mrs. Boatwright replied that they preferred not to\n24 . rent to block prospects and that such preference was\n2\nZ implemented by closely scrutinizing their application in\n26\nhope of finding a \"loophole.\" (RT-I-77-80). Mrs. Dvyer\n27 4.\nwas a credible witness.\n28\n10. Kenneth Romines, a former social director and\n29\npart-time rental agent, testified that he was told by\n30\n31 Stephen Weith, another rental agent at the Americana,\n32 that they were not supposed to rent apartments to blacks\n- 6\nII. 8.

(RT-II-9-11). Mr. Romines was a credible .\n9(cid:9) witness.\n10\n11. Four of these former employees testified concern-\n11\ning their participation in or observance of several instances\n12\nwhen the above policies were put into practice: For example,\n13\na black couple was told there were no one-bedroom apartments\n14\navailable when in fact there were (RT-I-43-49); a black •\n15\n16(cid:9) apartment seeker (Douglas Robinson) was told by a rental\n17(cid:9) agent that the apartment management had a discriminatory\n18(cid:9)\npolicy and that he would probably be better off not applying\n19\nfor an apartment and that he should apply at Tan Village\n20\n(cid:9) (RT-I-13-17, 33-34, 40-41); three different groups of black\n21\napplicants were discouraged by emphasis on the high price of\n22(cid:9)\n23(cid:9) the apartments, the deposit, the background check on their\n24(cid:9) financial status and told no apartments were available when\n(cid:9)\n25\nin fact there were (RT-I-110•111).

In response, the defendants offered the testimony\n2 of Mrs. Boatwright, who denied giving discriminatory in-\n3\nstructions to anyone, and testimony of other former Ameri-\n4\ncana rental agents, who said they had received no instruc-\n5\ntions from Mrs. Boatwright one way or the other, on the\na\nsubject of the apartment complex's racial policies and\n7\n8 contradicted the testimony of some Government witnesses on\n9 some specifics. One of defendants' witnesses, Mrs. Janine\n10 Colston, also a former Americana rental agent, testified\n11\nthat Mrs. Boatwright told of defendants' policy against\n12\nundesirables\" at one meeting but asserted that only\n\"\n13\n\"hippies,\" \"drug types\" and \"barefoot types\" were mentioned\n14\nas \"undesirable.\" However, she also testified that Mrs.\n15\n16 Boatwright personally lumped black persons and hippies into\n17\nthe same \"undesirable\" category. (RT-II-378-379).\n18\n13. Although there is some disagreement among the\n19\nfour former employees called by the Government as to precise\n20\ndetails of their experiences, their testimony is supported\n21\nby the complete absence of black tenants at the Americana\n22\n23 during the time in question, by the testimony of other wit-\n24 nesses who had rental experiences with defendants which\n25\nconformed to the methods suggested by Mrs. Boatwright for\n26\nimplementing defendants' discriminatory policy (see Findings\n27\n16-23, infra.) and by the Court's observation of the\n28\ndemeanor and credibility of all the witnesses.\n29\n30 14. Several of the Government's witnesses stated\n31 that Mrs. •Boatwright attributed her discriminatory instruc-\n32\ntions to her supervisors, Mr. Tan and Mr. Zee, who in turn\n8\n• . tAIVI IINM1 h I 1•1111Y1INC. • IP Vail • 1•.,” I I(cid:9) ihI •0'1\n\ndenied giving such instructions to Mrs. Boatwright. For\nI\n2 reasons set forth in Conclusion of Law No. 7 , infra, it is\n3\nnot necessary for the-Court to resolve this conflict.\n4\nMrs. Boatwright's behavior resulted from defendants' failure,\n5\nby design or by thoughtlessness, to supervise Mrs. Boat-\nwright and their failure to provide an objective, reviewable\n7\napplication procedure that would prevent black applicants\n8\n9 from being subjected to their agents' racially discriminatory\n10\npreferences.\n15. Accordingly, the Court finds that Mrs. Boatwright\nduring the course of her employment, gave discriminatory\nimstructions_to_rental agents working under her at the\nAmericana Apart  _Zs and that these instructions were on\n–\nvarious occasions implemented by rental agents, resulting in\nthe denial of apartments to blacks because of race.\n18\n16. In addition to the testimony regarding the\n19\ndiscriminatory instructions given by the resident manager\n20\nof the Americana to her subordinates, the United States\n21\nintroduced evidence of discriminatory treatment of blacks\n22\nat other of defendants' apartment complexes. A consider-\n23\n24 able proportion of this evidence consisted of the testimony\n*/\nof black and white \"testers\"  who visited various of\n–\n26\n*/ These testers operated under the auspices of two \"fair\n27 housing\" groups -- one the Mid-Peninsula Citizens For Fair\nHousing and the other an informal group at the Stanford\n2S Business School. ,The purpose of these groups was to\nascertain whether persons operating various apartments\n29\nwere treating black and white applicants alike. Their\nactivities are a reasonable means by which citizens nay\n30\nascertain the compliance status of landlords with fair\n31 housing laws and evidence 9f their activities is an appro-\npriate method of demonstrating the policies and practices\n32 of a particular landlord in a proceeding of this nature.\nSee Conclusions of Law Nos. 12-14, infra.\n-9-\nIt.

The testers' method was to have\n3\na black applicant and a white applicant usually of the\n4\nsame age and sex, make similar inquiry at an apartment\n5\non the same day within minutes of each other. In general,\n6\nthe \"tester\" witnesses appeared to be credible and\n7\nresponsible, and the Court believes their accounts of\n8\n9 what took place.\n10 17. The experiences to which the \"testers\" testified\n11\nfall into two main categories: first, whites asked if a\n•qi 12\ncredit check was necessary and were told that it was not,\n13–\nand that they could move in immediately or within a few\n1-4\ndays, while placirc were told that a credit check was\n15\n4(cid:9)\n16 necessary and it would take a period of time ranging from\n:(cid:9)\n17 a few days to a week; second, black applicants were told\n18\nthat no apartments were available while white applicants\n19\non virtually contemporaneous occasions were advised that\n20 *—/\napartments were available.  In response to this testimony,\n21\n4\nthe defendants offered the testimony of resident managers\n22\nand rental agents who had dealt with the witnesses for\n23\n24 the United States. In general, the defense witnesses\n25\nstated that they had never \"waived\" a credit check require-\n26\nment, and denied that they had told black applicants that\n27\napartments were riot available when in fact they were. In\n28\nsome instances, defendants contested the availability of\n29\nof apartments at the time tIe blacks applied.\n30\n31\n/ The credit check and avaklability experiences are\n32 summarized: in Appendix \"B\".\n-\nIt.S.WW1111,04CNTI'MPOW;IWI,WF,1,4.1141. 3111,,01\n\n18. With respect to alleged discrimination by\n1\n2 eefendants in relation to representations about credit\n3 checks, there is no evidence other than the statements of\n4\nwitnesses. Accordingly, the Court must weigh the credi-\n5\nbility of the witnesses. In doing so, the Court considers.\n6\nthe following: Mr. Zee, the defendants' general property\n7\nmanager, testified that he had instructed all resident\n8\n9 managers to tell prospective applicants that a credit\n10 check was required, even if they did not ask. (See\n11\ntestimony of Mr. Zee.) The resident managers as a general\n12\nrule testified that they did no credit check of their own,\n13\nbut that they simply passed applications and lease agree-\n14\nments on to the central office and that they knew of no\n15\none who had been rejected by the central office (e.g.,\n16\nsee testimony of Mrs. loatwright). Mr. Zee testified that\n18 he sometimes did credit checks, but to his recollection\n19\nno applicant had ever been rejected for insufficent credit.\n20\nIn fact,;Mr. Zee testified that his philosophy was to let\n21\npeople in and give them a chance to pay. From this the\n22\nCourt draws the inference that, subject to discrimination\n23\n24 against blacks and other racial minorities, it has  been\n-9a -\nTan policy to rent to all who fill out an application\n26\nwithout regard to the credit information, relying on\n27\ndefendants' ability to evict tenants who do not pay (see\n28\ntestimony of Mr.'Zee).\n29\n19. .Common sense dict'ates, and the Court finds,\n30\nthat resident managers using normal business practices\n31\n:32 would not scare off apartment applicants by mentioning\nII. N. (;t v1(cid:9) I 1.11INTINI1 (11,1•11.1, • 1..•fl(cid:9) - 1:11-9,11\n\na credit check which was, in fact, meaningless. Accordingly,\nthe Court finds that, under the circumstances, any mention\nof a credit check by resident managers was to discourage\napplicants, there being no other apparent reason for such\n1 \na procedure to be mentioned. Indeed, this is the explana-\ntion of the defendants' practices which was provided by the\nformer Americana rental agents, who related that the \"credit\ncheck\" device was simply a means of discouraging blacks -J\nor other people whom Mrs. Boatwright did not like, such as\nlong-haired hippies. (RT-I-13-14, 98, RT-II-27, 48, RT-\n111-379 and testimony of Mrs. Boatwright.) The racial\nstatistics at defendants' apartments also support the infer-\nence that this discouragement device was used against black\napplicents, and corroborate the testimony of the black\ntesters who stated they were told there was a credit check.\nAccordingly, the Court finds that defendants engaged in a\nselective screening practice which had the effect of exclud-\ning blacks from their various apartment complexes.\n20. With respect to the conflict in testimony on\nthe issue of apartment availability, the Court is aided\nby the defendants' records (Plaintiff's Exhibit 1), which\nreflect vacancies, by apartment type, by apartment number,\nand by building, at various Tan complexes during the times\nof the incidents at issue. These records consist of\n*/ William Brandt, one of the white testers, also testified\n—\non deposition that the resident manager at Tan's Sunshine\nGardens complex acknowledged in 1967 .that the credit check\nwas used as a racial screening device.

The records for Tan\n6\nVillage, Tan House and Tan Manor reflect the existence\nof vacancies at the time black testers were told there\n8\n9 were none, and the testimony is undisputed that vacancies\n10\nexisted at the Americana at all relevant times.

On her\nreturn the next day, Mrs. Bredt was shown\nthe apartment and told it would be avail-\nable on September 15.

(RT-II-66-67, 69). The\nDavenport incident, while perhaps less\ncompelling than the more flagrant incidents\nof unequal treatment described earlier in\n19\nthese Findings, corroborates Mrs. Tappan's\n20\ntestimony (RT-I-13-17) that defendants had\n21\na disposition to \"steer\" some black\n22\n23 applicants to their buildings in more\n24 significantly integrated areas, which had\n25\nrelatively more (though still few) black\n26\ntenants than defendants' all white or\n27\nvirtually all-white buildings in white\n28\nresidential areas.

See Con-\n3\nclusion of Law No. 7 in United States v.

A former rental agent at the\n10 Americana, all white at the time of suit and the largest\n11\napartment complex operated by defendants acknowledged\n12\nthe traditional twin fears of \"white flight\" and inability\n13\nto attract white prospects at the complex in the future\n14\nif blacks moved in. Under these circumstances, a compati-\n15\n16 bility standard tends to operate against a black applicant\n17 and to promote the continued all-white character of certain\n18\nof defendants' complexes and the gradual. change of racial\n19\ncharacter in those apartment complexes of defendants\n'(cid:9) 20\nlocated near an area of black concentration.

Quain, C.A. No. 70-C-1640 (N.D. Ill.

The sentence is so constructed that the\n\"bona fide offer\" requirement grammatically applies only\nto refusals to rent; and not to the remainder of the\nprohibition. Moreover, 42 U.S.C. 3604(d) makes it unlawful\nto misrepresent the availability of an apartment because\n- 27 -\n\nof race, and this section contains no requirement of a bona\n2 fide offer. Accordingly, the requirement of a bona fide\n3\nvictim is limited to discriminatory refusals to rent (or\nto sell, in the case of single family home), Dubose v.\n5\nCore  Realty Co., C.A. No. 69-C-422 (N.D. Ill. June 17,\ny\n6\n1969), and has no application to the other sections of the\n7\nstatute.\n9 14. Evidence provided by \"testers\" is particularly\n10\nuseful in \"pattern or practice\" type cases, in which the\n11\npolicy of the defendants and the vindication of the public\n12\ninterest are at issue, rather than any prompt private\n13\nremedy. In Bell Realty and  Ins. Co. v. alLE2121:71,..21p\n14\nHuman Relations, 266 N.E. 2d 769, 774 (Ill. App. 1971),\n15\n16 the Court said:\n17 The fact that a person was testing is\nan evicenriary fact. The evidence In\n18\nthe instant case supports the conclusion\nthat the broker was not aware that\n19\nHamilton was testing, and the further\n20 conclusion that Hamilton was denied a\nlisting solely because of his race.\n21\nWhere the defendant does not know that a person, whether\n22\n23 black or white, is \"testing,\" the defendant's treatment\n24 of the tester is persuasive as to what he would do in the\n25\ncase of a bona fide applicant.

D. California. \nFebruary 8, 1973. \n644*644 645*645 James L. Browning, Jr., U. S. Atty., David Bancroft, Asst. U. S.

Ferrari, Palo Alto, Cal., Bressani, Hansen & Blos, San Jose, Cal., for defendants. \nRichard G. Mansfield, Palo Alto, Cal., for Midpeninsula Citizens for Fair Housing. \nFINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSION OF LAW, AND \nJUDGMENT \nWOLLENBERG, District Judge. \nINTRODUCTORY STATEMENT \nThe United States instituted this action on June 16, 1971, pursuant to Title VIII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq., alleging that (1) the defendants have engaged \nin conduct constituting a pattern or practice of resistance to the enjoyment of rights secured \nby 42 U.S.C. § 3604 and that (2) the defendants have denied a group of persons rights \ngranted by Title VIII, which denial raised an issue of general public importance. The \nGovernment's complaint prays for injunctive and affirmative relief. In their answer, the \ndefendants denied the material allegations of the complaint. Trial was held on July 17-21 \nand July 31-August 3, 1972. On the basis of the evidence adduced at trial, and pursuant to \nRule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court now makes the following \nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law: \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nThe Defendants \n\n \n \n1. The defendant Tan Construction Company is owned and operated by the defendant T. S. \nTan (hereinafter \"Tan\" 646*646 or defendants). Tan operates and owns in whole or in part 11 \napartment buildings in and near the City of Palo Alto, California containing 1133 rental \nunits.[1] The first of these buildings began operations in 1959 and others have been opened \nat various times since then. \n2. The rental of the apartments ranges from $120 per month for an unfurnished one-\nbedroom apartment to far higher amounts for larger and more luxurious units. At the time of \nthe filing of this action, six of Tan's buildings had no black occupants and had never had \nany. One of those six was the Americana, which opened in October 1969 with 286 units and \nby the time of the suit had 486 units available for occupancy (though other parts of the \ncomplex were in various stages of construction). As of June 1971, when this action was \nfiled, Tan's other five buildings contained 14 units occupied by black persons, these units \nrepresenting 1.2% of the 1133 in all of Tan's buildings. However, 11 of the above 14 units \nwere located in three buildings (two large and one small) near East Palo Alto which contains \nthe only concentrated black residential area in the locality served by Tan's buildings. \n3. Each of defendants' apartment buildings is operated by a resident manager, most of \nwhom are helped out by relief managers on their days off. Two of the buildings have \nassistant managers (Americana and Tan Village.) The resident managers report to Tan's \ncentral office in Palo Alto and their immediate superior is Mr. Zee,[2] the defendants' general \nproperty manager. Mr. Zee has held this position since 1968. All of the resident managers \nand other persons employed to assist in the tenant application process have been white \npersons. \n4. Mrs. Louise Boatwright was the resident manager at the defendants' Americana complex \nbetween October 1969 and April 1971. Previously she had held this position at Sunshine \nGardens from October 1965 to March 1966, at Tan Manor from March 1966 to October \n1969 and at Tan Village from May 1971 to September 1971. Mrs. Boatwright was initially \nhired by Mr. Tan. Unlike the rest of defendants' apartment complexes the Americana \nemploys \"rental agents\" who work under the supervision of the resident manager and \nwhose job is to show prospective tenants around the complex and present those interested \nin applications to the resident manager for processing. \n5. At the trial, four of Tan's former employees who had worked at the Americana complex \nduring the time Mrs. Boatwright was the resident manager, testified that Mrs. Boatwright \nhad instructed them to discriminate against black persons and members of other minority \ngroups in the rental of apartments at the complex, and had made a number of statements \nindicating that it was defendants' policy and disposition to avoid renting to black tenants. \n6. Mrs. Boatwright suggested, and the rental agents carried out, several methods of \ndiscouraging minority applicants. These methods included showing applicants the most \nexpensive apartments, giving them incomplete tours of the Americana complex, and \nmisrepresenting the availability of apartments. In addition, rental agents were instructed to \nemphasize the security deposit requirements, and to inform applicants that two week credit \n\n \n \nchecks would be required before renting. These instructions were enforced by telling rental \nagents they would not receive a commission for renting to a black or other minority person. \n647*647 7. Although there is some disagreement among the four former employees called \nby the Government as to precise details of their experiences, their testimony is supported \nby the complete absence of black tenants at the Americana during the time in question, by \nthe testimony of other witnesses who had rental experiences with defendants which \nconformed to the methods suggested by Mrs. Boatwright for implementing defendants' \ndiscriminatory policy, and by the Court's observation of the demeanor and credibility of all \nthe witnesses. \n8. Several of the Government's witnesses stated that Mrs. Boatwright attributed her \ndiscriminatory instructions to her supervisors, Mr. Tan and Mr. Zee, who in turn denied \ngiving such instructions to Mrs. Boatwright. For reasons set forth in Conclusion of Law No. \n6, infra, it is not necessary for the Court to resolve this conflict. Mrs. Boatwright's behavior \nresulted from defendants' failure, by design or by thoughtlessness, to supervise Mrs. \nBoatwright and their failure to provide an objective, reviewable application procedure that \nwould prevent black applicants from being subjected to their agents' racially discriminatory \npreferences. \n9. Accordingly, the Court finds that Mrs. Boatwright during the course of her employment, \ngave discriminatory instructions to rental agents working under her at the Americana \nApartments and that these instructions were on various occasions implemented by rental \nagents, resulting in the denial of apartments to blacks because of race. \n10. In addition to the testimony regarding the discriminatory instructions given by the \nresident manager of the Americana to her subordinates, the United States introduced \nevidence of discriminatory treatment of blacks at other of defendants' apartment complexes. \nA considerable proportion of this evidence consisted of the testimony of black and white \n\"testers\"[3] who visited various of defendants' buildings to inquire about the availability of \napartments for rent. The testers' method was to have a black applicant and a white \napplicant usually of the same age and sex, make similar inquiry at an apartment on the \nsame day within minutes of each other. \n11. The experiences to which the \"testers\" testified fall into two main categories: first, whites \nasked if a credit check was necessary and were told that it was not, and that they could \nmove in immediately or within a few days, while blacks were told that a credit check was \nnecessary and it would take a period of time ranging from a few days to a week; second, \nblack applicants were told that no apartments were available while white applicants on \nvirtually contemporaneous occasions were advised that apartments were available.[4] \n12. The testimony of black and white testers was highly credible on its face. Moreover, the \nsubstance of their testimony was substantially corroborated by defendants' records on \napartment vacancy and availability, by the testimony of Tan's former employees, and by the \ntestimony of bona fide black applicants at Tan's buildings. \n\n \n \n13. The pattern of telling blacks that no apartments were available was not uniform; a \nhandful of blacks had been accepted at defendants' buildings at the time of suit and some \nblack testers were told apartments were available.[5] The 648*648 Court finds, however, that \non a substantial and significant number of occasions, defendants' agents falsely \nrepresented to black rental applicants that apartments were not available, and that they \nused the \"credit check\" device to discourage blacks from renting. The Court finds that this \nracially discriminatory conduct occurred because the owners and their top assistants failed \nto take aggressive action to insure that agents dealing with applicants treated everyone \nalike without regard to race or color. \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n1. This Court has jurisdiction of this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1345 and 42 U. S.C. § 3613. \n2. The apartment buildings described in Finding of Fact No. 1 are \"dwellings within the \nmeaning of 42 U.S.C. 3602(b).\" \n3. Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq.) is an appropriate and \nconstitutionally permissible exercise of Congressional power under the Thirteenth \nAmendment to bar all racial discrimination, private as well as public, in the sale and rental of \nreal property. United States v. Hunter, 459 F.2d 205 (4th Cir. 1972), cert. den., 409 U.S. \n934, 93 S.Ct. 235, 34 L.Ed.2d 189, aff'g 324 F.Supp. 529 (D. Md.1971); United States v. \nReal Estate Development Corp., 347 F.Supp. 776, (N.D.Miss.1972); United States v. \nReddoch (No. 6541-71-P, S.D.Ala., January 27, 1972), aff'd, 467 F.2d 897 (5th Cir. \n1972); Brown v. State Realty, 304 F. Supp. 1236 (N.D.Ga.1969); United States v. Mintzes, \n304 F.Supp. 1305 (D. Md.1969). \n4. In weighing the evidence in this case, the court recognizes that the law prohibits \n\"sophisticated as well as simple-minded modes of discrimination.\" United States v. Real \nEstate Development Corp., supra; Lane v. Wilson, 307 U.S. 268 at 275, 59 S.Ct. 872, 83 \nL.Ed. 1281 (1939); Gaston County v. United States, 288 F.Supp. 678 \n(D.D.C.1968), aff'd 395 U.S. 285, 89 S.Ct. 1720, 23 L. Ed.2d 309 (1969). Racially \nderogatory remarks, by those in a position to influence the attitude of fellow and subordinate \nemployees toward apartment applicants of a particular race, can reasonably be expected to \nadversely affect the rental opportunities of applicants. Thus, laws prohibiting discrimination \nin housing because of race prohibit not only, for example, overt racial rejection of \napplicants, but subtle behavior as well. United States v. Mitchell, 327 F. Supp. 476 \n(N.D.Ga.1971) (reasonable man standard applied to \"subtle\" statements in fair housing \ncase). \n5. Section 804(a) of the 1968 Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 3604(a)), in addition to \nspecifying that it shall be unlawful to refuse to rent or to refuse to negotiate for the rental of \nhousing because of race, also makes it unlawful to \"otherwise make unavailable\" housing, \nor to deny housing because of race. The foregoing phraseology appears to be as broad as \n\n \n \nCongress could have made it, and all practices which have the effect of denying dwellings \non prohibited grounds are therefore unlawful. United States v. Real Estate Development \nCorp., supra; United States v. Grooms, 348 F.Supp. 1130 (M.D.Fla. 1972). The imposition \nof more burdensome application procedures, of delaying tactics, and of various forms of \ndiscouragement by resident managers and rental agents constitutes a violation of Section \n3604(a) not only by those who impose these procedural roadblocks, Hall v. Freitas, 343 \nF.Supp. 1099, 1101 (N.D. Cal.1972); Stearns v. Fair Employment Practice Commission, 6 \nCal.3d 205, 98 Cal.Rptr. 467, 490 P.2d 857 (1971), but also by top management and \nowners who fail to set forth objective and reviewable procedures for apartment application \nand rental. Failure to provide a black applicant with necessary and correct information \nconcerning what he must do to become a tenant discourages and impedes his application \nand results in his exclusion from the apartments because of race. United States v. West \nPeachtree Tenth Corp., 437 F.2d 221 649*649 (5th Cir. 1971); United States v. \nReddoch, supra, slip opinion at p. 24. \n6. The discriminatory conduct of an apartment manager or rental agent is, as a general rule, \nattributable to the owner and property manager of the apartment complex, both under the \ndoctrine of respondeat superior and because the duty to obey the law is non-\ndelegable. United States v. Real Estate Development Corp., supra; United States v. \nReddoch, supra; Williamson v. Hampton Mgt. Co., 339 F.Supp. 1146 (N.D.Ill.1972); \nand United States v. Mitchell, 335 F.Supp. 1004, 1006 (N.D. Ga.1971). As the court stated \nin United States v. Real Estate Development Corp., supra, 347 F.Supp. at 785 (apartment \ncase): \nThe resident managers and managers of the defendants, as agents of the defendants, are \nauthorized to represent the defendants and can rent in no other capacity. Their acts and \nstatements, made within the scope of their agency, are attributable to the defendants, \nwhose duty to comply with the law is non-delegable. United States v. Reddoch, supra, slip \nopinion at 28; Williamson v. Hampton Mgt. Co., 339 F.Supp. 1146 (N.D.Ill.1972). \nOwners and supervisors are responsible for the conduct of their agents; an injunction has \nbeen issued against principals for the unlawful conduct of their agents even where they \ninstructed them to obey the law at regular staff meetings. United States v. Mitchell, 335 F. \nSupp. 1004 (N.D.Ga.1971). Accordingly, where, as here, management's lack of supervision \nand failure to establish objective and reviewable procedural standards have resulted in \napartments being made unavailable to blacks by agents and employees, management's \nfailure to act is in itself violative of Section 3604(a). \n7. As the court said in United States v. Reddoch, supra, at 22-23, another apartment \ndiscrimination case: \n\"in the problem of racial discrimination, statistics often tell much, and Courts listen.\" State of \nAlabama v. United States, 304 F.2d 583 (5th Cir. 1962) aff'd 371 U.S. 37 [83 S.Ct. 145, 9 \nL.Ed.2d 112] (1962). \"Nothing is as emphatic as zero.\" United States v. Hinds County Board \nof Education, 417 F.2d 852 at 858 (5th Cir. 1969). \n\n \n \nAccord: Newbern v. Lake Lorelei, Inc., 308 F.Supp. 407, 417 (S.D.Ohio \n1968) (housing); United States v. Real Estate Development Corp., supra. In the present \ncase, six of defendants' eleven apartment buildings, containing 752 (roughly 2/3 ) of its \n1133 rental units, have been in continuous operation from various opening dates ranging \nfrom March 1961 to February 1970, and none had a black tenant prior to the filing of the \ninstant suit in June 1971. Moreover, defendants acknowledge that no black person has ever \nresided at four of these six buildings. The remaining five apartment buildings have been in \noperation for varying time periods ranging from 3 to 13 years, but none had a black tenant \nuntil December 1967, when the first black tenant moved into Tan House. At the time of suit \nonly 14 of defendants' 1133 units (or 1.2%) were occupied by blacks. This evidence \nconstitutes, at least a prima facie case of racial discrimination, casting a burden upon the \ndefendant to come forward with evidence to the contrary. United States v. Real Estate \nDevelopment Corp., supra; United States v. Reddoch, supra; Parham v. Southwestern Bell \nTelephone Co., 433 F.2d 421 at 426 (8th Cir. 1970); Jones v. Lee Way Motor Freight, Inc., \n431 F.2d 245 at 247, 248 (10th Cir. 1970), cert. den., 401 U.S. 954, 91 S.Ct. 972, 28 \nL.Ed.2d 237 (1971). \n8. The legal effect of the foregoing statistical evidence is reinforced by the absence of an \nobjective and uniform rental application procedure. Just as vague and undefined \nemployment standards which result in whites, but not blacks, being hired are unlawfully \ndiscriminatory, so too are arbitrary and uncontrolled apartment rental procedures which \nproduce otherwise unexplained 650*650 racially discriminatory results. See Brown v. Gaston \nCounty Dyeing Mach. Co., 457 F.2d 1377 at 1383 (4th Cir. 1972), cert. den. 409 U.S. 982, \n93 S. Ct. 319, 34 L.Ed.2d 246 (employment). \n9. The statistics set forth in paragraph 7 raise the inference that the arbitrary procedural \nroadblocks placed in the path of black rental applicants were put there because of race, and \nnot neutral thoughtlessness. \n10. Defendants have instructed their apartment managers to seek prospective tenants who \nfit in with present tenants. Prospective compatibility with other tenants is not an appropriate \nrental consideration where its application would have a discriminatory racial impact. See \nConclusion of Law No. 7 in United States v. Reddoch, supra. In apartment rental cases, a \ncompatibility standard should be carefully scrutinized when some of defendants' complexes \nhave no black tenants and the few blacks renting from defendants are concentrated in \ncomplexes located near a black residential area. \n11. Evidence of the experiences of white and black \"testers\" or \"checkers\" has been \nuniformly admitted into evidence to show the existence of a discriminatory policy. Evers v. \nDwyer, 358 U. S. 202, 79 S.Ct. 178, 3 L.Ed.2d 222 (1958) (buses); Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. \nS. 547, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967) (bus terminals); Newbern v Lake Lorelei, \nInc., supra (housing); Harris v. Jones, 296 F.Supp. 1082 (D. Mass.1969) (housing); Brown \nv. Dallas, 331 F.Supp. 1033 (N.D.Tex.1971) (housing); Williamson v. Hampton \nManagement Co., supra at p. 1148 of 339 F. Supp. (housing); Seaton v. Sky Realty Co., \nC.A.No.70-C-972 (N.D., Ill. June 25, 1972) (housing). \n\n \n \n12. 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a) makes it unlawful to refuse to rent an apartment after the making of \na bona fide offer, to refuse to negotiate for rental, and to otherwise make unavailable or \ndeny an apartment, because of race. The sentence is so constructed that the \"bona fide \noffer\" requirement grammatically applies only to refusals to rent, and not to the remainder of \nthe prohibition. Moreover, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(d) makes it unlawful to misrepresent the \navailability of an apartment because of race, and this section contains no requirement of \na bona fide offer. Accordingly, the requirement of a bona fide victim is limited to \ndiscriminatory refusals to rent (or to sell, in the case of single family home), Dubose v. \nGorey Realty Co., C.A.No.69-C-422 (N.D.Ill. June 17, 1969), and has no application to the \nother sections of the statute. \n13. To prevail in this case under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. § 3613, the Attorney General \nmust show either: \n(a) a pattern or practice of resistance to the enjoyment of the right to equal housing \nopportunity; \nor \n(b) a denial of such rights to a group of persons, as to which denial the Attorney General \nhas made a determination of general public importance. \nUnited States v. Hunter, supra; United States v. Reddoch, supra; United States v. Real \nEstate Development Corp., supra. \n14. Instructions by a resident manager to rental agents to discriminate in various ways \nagainst black and Mexican-American applicants are imputable to the defendants and \nconstitute a discriminatory course of conduct, which satisfies the pattern or practice \nrequirements of 42 U.S.C. § 3613. United States v. Reddoch, supra; United States v. West \nPeachtree Tenth Corp., supra; United States v. Alexander and Cloutier Realty Co., \nC.A.No.13805, supra (policy admissions). This is true both as to the direct instructions to \ndiscriminate, such as those given by Mrs. Boatwright to several employees, and as to \nstatements and conduct which, while not specifically ordering discrimination, are reasonably \ncalculated to cause subordinates to discriminate. \n15. Even though specific acts of agents were in themselves violations of other sections of \nthe Act (e. g. agents violated Section 3604(d) by telling black rental applicants that no \napartments 651*651 were available when one in fact was available), the paramount concern \nof the Court in a pattern or practice case of this kind must be the underlying violation of \nSection 3604(a) by the principal —failure to exercise sufficient control over agents, with the \neffect that housing was made unavailable because of race. Principals who provide an \natmosphere in which agents may and do, easily and without supervision or control, make \nhousing unavailable because of race engage in a pattern or practice of discrimination even \nthough no specific instructions were given to agents to do so and even though management \ngives perfunctory instructions to \"treat everyone alike\" without any effective effort to insure \nthat the instructions are carried out. \n\n \n \n16. The \"second alternative\" of 42 U.S.C. § 3613 authorizes injunctive relief in favor of the \ngovernment where there has been a denial of rights granted by the Act to any group of \npersons and where the Attorney General had determined[6] that such denial raises an issue \nof general public importance. United States v. Reddoch, supra; United States v. Real Estate \nDevelopment Corp., supra; United States v. Hunter, supra. \n17. Injunctive relief is appropriate in this case on the sole basis of defendants' \ndiscriminatory treatment of blacks through their agents. Similarly, an injunction based on the \nextrajudicial admissions of a discriminatory policy and instructions to discriminate by \ndefendants' agents, standing alone, is justified. The need for such relief is even more \ncogent when all of these kinds of evidence are considered together. United States v. \nReddoch, supra, slip opinion at 27; United States v. Real Estate Development \nCorp., supra, 347 F.Supp. at 784. \n18. Defendants claim that no injunctive relief is necessary in this case, as they claim to be \nready to obey the law. The defendants' good faith, however, does not justify the withholding \nof injunctive relief where, as here, the statutory prerequisites for an injunction have been \nmet. United States v. West Peachtree Tenth Corp., supra; United States v. Real Estate \nDevelopment Corp., supra. In the present case, the active discrimination was done by \nagents of the defendants. If the defendants are enjoined, their agents will be subject to the \nprovisions of the decree and liable for contempt if they violate it. There would, however, be \nno effective control of the agents' conduct if injunctive relief were withheld. Accordingly, the \ncourt will issue an injunction which, while keeping federal intrusion into defendants' \nbusiness practices to the minimum required to assure equal housing opportunity, will at the \nsame time be sufficiently comprehensive to assure compliance by all concerned. United \nStates v. West Peachtree Tenth Corp., supra, 437 F.2d at 229 et seq. \n19. Any of the foregoing Conclusions of Law which should more properly be denominated a \nFinding of Fact may be so considered. \nJUDGMENT \nPursuant to the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, it is hereby Ordered, \nAdjudged and Decreed that the defendant Youritan Construction Company, dba Tan \nConstruction Company, and its owners, officers, agents, employees, successors and all \npersons in active concern or participation with any of them, are permanently enjoined with \nrespect to the operations of all apartment buildings owned, managed or controlled by them \nnow or in the future from: \n1. Making unavailable or denying any dwelling to any person on account of race, color or \nnational origin. \n\n \n \n652*652 2. Discriminating against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of rental \nof a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of \nrace, color or national origin. \n3. Making, printing, or publishing, or causing to be made, printed, or published, any notice, \nstatement, or advertisement, with respect to the rental of a dwelling that indicates any \npreference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. \n4. Representing to any person because of race, color, or national origin that any dwelling is \nnot available for inspection or rental when such dwelling is in fact available. \n5. Failing or refusing to hire, assign, promote or recruit any employee or prospective \nemployee on account of race, color, religion or national origin, or engaging in any \ndiscriminatory employment practice within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. \nIt is further Ordered that the defendants[7] shall forthwith adopt and implement an affirmative \nprogram of compliance with the provisions of the Fair Housing Act in order to insure that in \nthe future all apartments will be available for inspection by and rental to black and other \nnonwhites on the same basis that they are made available for inspection by and rental to \nwhite persons. This program shall include the following: \nA. The defendants shall, within 30 days of the entry of this Order, conduct an educational \nprogram for its rental personnel and other agents and employees to inform them of the \nprovisions of this Order and their duties under the Fair Housing Act. Such program shall \ninclude the following: \n1. A copy of this Order shall be furnished to each agent and employee. \n2. By general meeting or individual conference, the defendants shall inform each agent and \nemployee of the provisions of this Order and of the duties of the defendants and their \nagents and employees under the Fair Housing Act. Each agent and employee shall also be \ninformed that his failure to comply with the provisions of this Order shall subject him to \ndismissal or other appropriate disciplinary action. \n3. Each agent and employee shall sign a statement that he has read this Order and that he \nfully understands his responsibilities thereunder. \n4. The above stated program shall be given within 15 days of the filing of this Order, and \nthereafter, upon the hiring of any new employee, within 5 days of the commencement of his \nduties. \nB. The defendants shall inform the public generally and their customers and clients \nspecifically of the defendants' nondiscriminatory policy by the following actions: \n1. Each of defendants' application forms and lease agreements shall contain a prominent \nstatement that apartments will be shown and made available for rental to all persons without \nregard to race, color, religion or national origin in compliance with the 1968 Fair Housing \nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 3604. In addition, at the time of application, prospective tenants of the \n\n \n \ndefendant are to be orally informed of this provision and of the defendants' uniform rental \napplication standards and procedures including financial requirements, credit checks, \nwaiting periods, etc. \n2. All advertising of apartments complexes owned or operated by defendants in newpapers \nor other media[8] including radio and TV and in billboards, pamphlets, brochures, handouts, \nand writings of any kind, shall include a statement prominently placed and easily legible to \nthe effect that apartments are rented 653*653 without regard to race, color, religion or \nnational origin. \n3. On the 1st and 15th day of each month, the defendants shall post and maintain (1) a list \nof actual and expected vacancies at all buildings in their central office at 3630 El Camino \nReal, Palo Alto, California, and (2) a list of actual vacancies at each individual apartment \ncomplex owned now or in the future by any defendant at the rental office of such apartment \ncomplex. \n4. Within thirty days of the entry of this Order, the defendants shall permanently post in a \nconspicuous location in the defendants' business office at 3630 El Camino Real, Palo Alto, \nCalifornia, or immediately outside the office, a notice or sign, clearly visible to prospective \napplicants, stating that defendant rents dwellings on a racially nondiscriminatory basis. In \naddition, the defendants shall place a \"Fair Housing\" notice or sign of the type described in \nthe preceding sentence in a prominent place in the rental office or immediately outside the \nrental office of each apartment building which it owns or operates. All signs to be posted \npursuant to this Order shall be in conformity with pertinent regulations of the Secretary of \nHUD, 37 F.R. 3429 et seq. A copy of said regulations is attached hereto as Appendix \"C\". \nC. The defendants shall establish and implement uniform, objective and nondiscriminatory \nstandards and procedures for the processing, evaluation and approval of applications, \nwhich shall insure that prospective tenants are accorded an informed choice of apartments \nat all of defendants' complexes. These standards and procedures shall not be more \nonerous or stringent than those heretofore applied to white applicants. Within 30 days of the \nentry of this Order, defendants shall file with the Court, with copies to plaintiff, the proposed \nstandards and procedures. Plaintiff shall have twenty days from receipt of these standards \nand procedures to file objections with the Court. If plaintiff files no objection, and if the Court \nmakes no contrary ruling sua sponte, these standards and procedures shall be adopted \nwithout further order of the Court. \nIf after the adoption and approval of objective standards and procedures, the defendants \ndesire to alter them, they may do so, provided that any changes are objective, in writing, \nand non-racial in purpose and effect. If any such change is made within three years of the \nentry of this Order, it shall be filed with the Court, with copies to plaintiff, and any dispute \narising from such proposed change may be raised by either party in any subsequent \nappropriate proceeding in this Court. \nIt is further Ordered that the defendants shall, for three years following the entry of this \nOrder, make, keep and preserve the following records for all of the apartment complexes \nwhich they own and/or operate: \n\n \n \n(a) The name, address and race of each person inquiring in person about the availability or \nterms of rental of an apartment therein, the date, and whether: \n1. He was offered an application. \n2. He filled out an application. \n3. He submitted an application. \n4. The application was sent to the central office. \n5. He made a deposit. \n6. He was accepted for waiting list. \n7. His application was approved and he was accepted for occupancy. \n8. His application was rejected, and, if so, the reasons therefor. \n(b) The number of apartments available on each of the above dates, the type of apartments \n(i. e., one bedroom, two bedroom, etc.) available, the type of apartment requested by each \nperson, and all vacancy and other information required to be reported to the Court under the \nreporting provisions of this Order. \nIt is further Ordered that ninety days after the entry of this Order, and at 654*654 three-\nmonth intervals thereafter for a period of three years following the entry of this Order, the \ndefendants shall serve on counsel for the plaintiff a report containing the following \ninformation for each apartment they own and/or operate: \n(a) The name, address and race of each person making inquiry about the availability or \nterms of rental of an apartment during the preceding three-month period, and whether such \nperson: \n1. Made inquiry. \n2. Was offered an application. \n3. Filled out an application. \n4. Submitted an application. \n5. Had their application sent to the central office. \n6. Made a deposit. \n7. Were accepted for a waiting list. \n8. Were accepted for occupancy. \n9. Were rejected, and if rejected, the reasons therefor. \nSaid defendants shall further report, with respect to each vacancy at each apartment \ncomplex owned or operated by any of them during the reporting period, \n(a) The building and the apartment number; \n(b) The date notification was received that the apartment would become available for rent; \n(c) The date the apartment became available for rent; \n(d) The date the apartment was no longer available for rent; and \n(e) The date that the apartment was occupied by a new tenant and the name of and race of \nthe new occupant or occupants. \nAdditionally, for each apartment complex owned or operated by any of them, the defendants \nshall include in the first report the number of persons or families, by race, who are residing \n\n \n \nthere at the time of the entry of this Order.[9] In the event that defendants acquire any other \napartment building subsequent to the entry of this Order, they shall furnish plaintiff's counsel \nwith the location and name (if there is one) of such apartment building and the racial \ncomposition of the building by unit.

The purpose of these groups was to \nascertain whether persons operating various apartments were treating black and white applicants alike. Their \nactivities are a reasonable means by which citizens may ascertain the compliance status of landlords with fair \nhousing laws and evidence of their activities is an appropriate method of demonstrating the policies and practices of a \nparticular landlord in a proceeding of this nature. See Conclusion of Law No. 11, infra. \n[4] The credit check and availability experiences are summarized in Appendix \"B\". \n[5] See Appendix \"B\". \n[6] In United States v. Real Estate Development Corp., supra, 347 F.Supp. at p. 784, the Court said: \nAs indicated in Reddoch, the Attorney General's determination of general public importance is not reviewable. \nSee United States v. Mitchell, 313 F.Supp. 299 (N.D. Ga.1970); United States v. Greenwood Municipal Separate \nSchool District, 406 F.2d 1086 (5th Cir. 1970) (determination that suit will promote orderly school desegregation). \n[7] This term includes Youritan Construction Company and all persons or other entities subject to this Order as \ndescribed in the first paragraph of this Order. \n[8] In radio advertising, the equal opportunity statement shall be easily audible. \n[9] This information should set out the number of units occupied by persons of each race. \n[10] This report shall contain information regarding the number of persons, by race, who are residing at each of the \napartment buildings owned or operated by defendants at the time of the entry of the Order. \n[*] This information was obtained from Plaintiff's Exhibit 5 and Defendants' Exhibit 1. \n[1] Bredt was told that a 1 bedroom apartment would be available in 3 days and was invited back to see similar \napartment next day. \n[2] Fitch was told that a 1-bedroom apartment would be available in 16 days and quoted a rental price $20 higher \nthan white witness in footnote 1. \n[3] Evans requested a 1-bedroom apartment and was told that only a studio apartment was available. He was also \ntold that a 1-bedroom apartment would not be available for 8 days. He also inquired about the price of a 1-bedroom \napartment and was quoted a rent of $185 per month, which was $20 in excess of rent quoted to white witness. (See \nfootnote 1). \n[4] In addition, four studios were to become vacant by 8-14-71. \n[5] In addition, three 2-bedroom apartments were to become vacant by 2-8-71. \n[6] Mrs. Roberts did not, however, tell Mrs. Davenport about Apartment No. 90/104, an unfurnished 1-bedroom \napartment which was vacant at the time. (See P. Ex. 1, Part B(2). Particular reference should be made to the weekly \nvacancy reports for August 9 and 16, 1970.) \n\n \n \n[7] McCullen was quoted a security deposit which was $40 more than the two white testers (i. e., Brandt and Smith) \nwho went to the Americana on the same day. \n ",

      "text": " \n \n509 F.2d 623 (1975) \nUNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff-Appellee, \nv. \nYOURITAN CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, a corporation, et al., \nDefendants-Appellants. \nNo. 73-2445. \nUnited States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit. \nJanuary 14, 1975. \n624*624 Judith Wolf (argued), Dept. of Justice, Housing Section, Washington, D. C., for \nplaintiff-appellee. \nGerald B. Ferrari (argued), Palo Alto, Cal., for defendants-appellants. \nBefore HAMLEY, MERRILL and DUNIWAY, Circuit Judges. \nOPINION \nPER CURIAM: \nThe defendants appeal from a judgment enjoining them from violating, and requiring certain \nactions to ensure their complaince with, the Fair Housing Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-\n3631. The trial judge's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and judgment are reported \nin United States v. Youritan Construction Co., N.D.Cal., 1973, 370 F.Supp. 643. \nAppellants mount a broadside attack on the trial court's findings, conclusions and judgment, \nbut we find no sufficient substance in any of them, with one exception, to require a reversal. \nThe attack on the findings is largely based on conflicting evidence, and conflicting \ninferences that can be drawn from the evidence. We find no clear error in the judge's \nresolutions of these conflicts. Assuming that, as appellants argue, certain evidence was \nerroneously admitted, we are convinced that its exclusion would not have affected the \nresult. We therefore affirm the judgment for the reasons stated by the trial judge, except in \none respect. \nThe action was filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 3613 to enforce the Fair Housing Act. There is \nnot one word in the complaint charging violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \n(Pub.L. 88-352, Title VII, 78 Stat. 253-266), since amended by the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Act of 1972 (Pub.L. 92-261, 86 Stat. 103) and codified at 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e to \n2000e-17. There is almost nothing in the record about appellants' employment practices, \nand what little there is was admitted only to show the appellants' state of mind. The trial \n\n \n \njudge found that all of appellants' resident managers and other persons employed to assist \nin the tenant application process have been white persons. There is evidence to support \nthis finding. (Finding 3, 370 F.Supp. at 646). However, the court did not find that appellants \nhad violated the Equal Employment Opportunity Act, and there is almost nothing in the \nrecord to sustain such a finding, if it had been made. \nNevertheless, paragraph 5 of the injunction (370 F.Supp. at 652) orders compliance with 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000e et seq. \nWe leave to another day the question whether the Attorney General could have combined in \none action a proceeding to enforce the Fair Housing Act and a proceeding to enforce the \nEqual Employment Opportunity Act. We note, for 625*625 example, that the primary enforcer \nof the latter Act is now the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, not the Attorney \nGeneral. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-5 and 2000e-6(c). The fact is that in this action the \nAttorney General did not even purport to be enforcing the Equal Employment Opportunity \nAct. We think that basic requirements of notice and opportunity to defend require that \nparagraph 5 of the injunction be stricken. \nThe case is remanded to the district court with directions to strike paragraph 5 of the \ninjunction. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. \n ",

Whether the District Court correctly ruled that the\nevidence was sufficient to entitle the United States to injunctive\nrelief under 42 U.S.C. 3613.\nSTATEMENT \nProceedings Below \nThis action was brought by the United States on June 16, 1971,\npursuant to Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (fair housing\nlaw), 42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq., alleging racial discrimination in the\nrental of apartments owned and operated by defendants (hereinafter\nreferred to as \"appellants\" or \"Tan\"). The complaint alleges that\nthe appellants engaged in a pattern and practice of resistance to\nthe enjoyment of the rights granted by the Fair Housing Act, and\nthat their conduct constituted a denial of rights secured by the Act,\nwhich denial raised an issue of general public importance. 42 U.S.C.\n3613. Plaintiff prayed for injunctive and affirmative relief.\nAppellants denied the material allegations of the complaint and trial\nwas held on July 17-20 and July 31 - August 3, 1972.\n\nOn February 8, 1973, the District Court issued an opinion and\n*/\norder (Cl. T. 323-345)— holding that the appellants had engaged in\nracially discriminatory conduct and entered injunctive and affirmative\nrelief.\nFacts \nThe facts in this case are comprehensively set forth in the trial\njudge's Findings of Fact, and we do not repeat them here. Briefly,\nthe District Court found that appellants, through the resident manager\nof one of their buildings, instructed rental agents to discriminate\nagainst black persons in the rental of apartments, that these instruc-\ntions were implemented by defendants' agents in a variety of methods,\nand that the discriminatory behavior resulted from defendants' failure,\nby design or by thoughtlessness, to provide adequate supervision of\nemployees. The Court also found that racially discriminatory conduct\noccurred at other of appellants' buildings, that the witnesses called\nby the United States to prove these facts were credible, and that the\nevidence of discrimination was supported by statistical evidence, which\nshowed no blacks or very few at all of Tan's buildings. (Findings of\n._ Fact 5-9, 12-13).\nARGUMENT \nI. THE DISTRICT COURT'S FINDINGS OF FACT ARE BASED ON SUBSTANTIAL\nEVIDENCE AND WERE NOT CLEARLY ERRONEOUS\nThe appellants seek to undermine the District Court's general\nFindings of Fact by a blunderbuss attack on the specific elements of\n*/ Cl. T. refers to the Clerk's Transcript of the trial.\n\nthe evidence which supports these Findings. In order to succeed,\nappellants must upset the court's findings on credibility, eliminate\nthat evidence they contend to be inadmissible, reject the statistical\ncorroboration of direct evidence, and ignore uncontradicted evidence.\nThis they have failed to do. The record supports the reasonableness\nand fairness of the decision below, which held that appellants dis-\ncriminated in apartment rentals and that injunctive relief was\nnecessary to insure compliance with the Fair Housing Act.\nA. Questions of credibility are for the trial court and are \nnot reviewable on appeal.\nAppellants contend that the District Court's findings were\nbased on conflicting testimony, incorrect determination of credibility,\nand inadmissible evidence, and are therefore \"clearly erroneous\"\nwithin the meaning of Rule 52(a), F.R.C.P. They argue, for example,\nthat the testimony of plaintiff's white witness Gross, who testified\nthat no one told him he would be required to undergo a credit check\n(in contrast to the experiences of the black testers) is \"unreliable\"\nbecause it is said to have been contradicted by the testimony of\nseveral of Tan's managers. (Tan brief, p. 22.) They also attack\nthe testimony of appellants' former employees, who testified that\nthey received and on occasion carried out racially discriminatory\ninstructions, as the \"highly inconsistent and contradicted testimony\n\n*/\nby three — disgruntled former Tan employees.\" The District Court,\nhowever, after having the opportunity to observe the witnesses\npersonally, made specific findings as to their credibility.\nThese findings were explicitly based, in substantial part, on the\nCourt's \"observation of the demeanor and credibility of all the\n** /\nwitnesses.\"--Such findings may not be disturbed on appeal. United \nStates v. Reddoch, 467 F. 2d 897 (5th Cir. 1972), (per curiam), aff'g \nP.H. E.O.H. Rptr. Para. 13,569 (S.D. Ala. 1972); Glenn Falls \nIndemnity Co. v. United States, 229 F. 2d 370, 373 (9th Cir. 1955).\nIn Reddoch, as in this case, the proof of discrimination in\nrentals included the testimony of former employees that they received\ndiscriminatory instructions, the testimony of blacks and whites --\nfewer than in this case -- as to their rental experiences, and a\nsimilar statistical showing. On appeal, appellants attacked the\ntestimony as conflicting and incredible and the statistics as\n*** /\nirrelevant.(cid:9) In addressing itself to a question virtually identical\nto the one presented here, the Court of Appeals said:\n*/ In fact, the District Lourt found that four former employees so\ntestified. See Finding of Fact No. 5. Cl. T. I 326.\n**/ Finding of Fact No. 7 (former employees) and Nos. 10 and 12 (testers\n***/ In Reddoch, the apartment complex was in a white section of\nMobile. See page(cid:9) 18(cid:9) , below.\n4\n\nCredibility choices and the resolution of\nconflicting testimony are for the district\ncourt, subject only to the clearly erroneous\nrule. Rule 52(a), F.R.Civ.P.\nWe think that the two cases are indistinguishable and that the District\nCourt's findings, based upon its determination of credibility, should\nbe sustained on appeal.\nB. The district .udge s findings are based on admissible evidence.\nAppellants contend that certain findings of the District\nJudge concerning disparate treatment of black and white applicants\nat the Americana should be set aside because they are allegedly based\non inadmissible hearsay evidence. They argue that the testimony of\na black and white test team (Arthur McCullen and Phillip Smith)\nconcerning their visit to the Americana should have been stricken\nfrom the record on the alleged ground that no proper foundation was\nlaid for the use of memoranda which the witnesses prepared immediately\nafter visiting the complex in order to record their experiences while\ntheir recollection was still fresh.\nIt defies reason to suggest that the Court should rely\nexclusively on a man's recollection months or years after an event\nwhen he recorded his observations at the moment they occurred, and\nwhen the contemporaneously prepared documents were available to him\nat the time of his testimony to refresh his recollection. Accordingly,\n- \n5, -\n\n*/\nthe trial judge properly denied appellants' motion to strike this\n**/\ntestimony. (RT VII 48-50.)— Santa Fe Drilling Co. v. N.L.R.B., 416\nF. 2d 725, 730, n. 4 (9th Cir. 1969); and see III Wigmore on Evidence\nCS 758 et seq. (3rd Ed. 1940).\nAppellants criticize this testimony on the ground that the\nwitnesses allegedly failed to testify that what they had written\ndown was true. Their criticism is factually inaccurate, for each\nwitness testified that the documents reflected the truth to the best\n***/\nof his recollection. Moreover, the documents prepared by these\nwitnesses were used to refresh their recollection, and appellants'\nextensive discussion of the requirements under state law for \"past\nrecollection recorded\" misses the point.\n*/ At this time, the objection was phrased in terms of relevancy.\n**/ RT VII refers to Volume VII of the Reporter's Transcript of the\ntrial. Due to the fact the original seven volumes of the reporter's\ntranscript were not pagenated sequentially, the court reporter, on\nappellants' request, consolidated the original seven transcripts\ninto five volumes for purposes of sequential numeration. The old\nnumber was retained on each transcript page. Since the appellee's\ncopy relfects the old numbering system, we shall refer to that\n4, number when making reference to the reporter's transcript in our\nbrief.\n***/ Smith Dep., pp. 19-20; McCullen Dep. p. 20;  see P.Exh. 4(b)\nand (c).\n\nFinally, since the testimony of these two witnesses as to\nTan's discriminatory use of the \"credit check\" ruse was merely\ncumulative of other independent evidence— before the trial court,\nany error would have been harmless. Cf. Wineberg v. Park, 321 F.\n2d 214, 218-219 (9th Cir. 1963).\n*/ Black persons, on at least ten separate occasions, were told that\nthey would have to undergo a credit check as a condition of occupancy, (cid:9)\n1\nwhile white persons who made virtually contemporaneous visits to the\nTan buildings were told such a check was unnecessary. (Cl.T. I\n348-352, Appendix B.)\n\nC. The district judge's findings correctly reflect the evidence.\nThe District Court found that appellants discriminated against\nblack applicants, among other ways, by falsely representing to them\nthat apartments were not available and by using a \"credit check\"\ndevice to discourage blacks. These findings were based on the\nexperiences of black bona fide apartment seekers and of matched\nwhite and black \"testers\" who visited eight of Tan's buildings. The\nspecifics of these disparate experiences are contained in Appendix B\n*/\nto the District Court's Findings of Fact. — Appellants contend that\nthe appendix \"inaccurately portrayed disparate treatment of black\nand white testers\" (Brief, p. 18), in that it allegedly failed to\ntake into account the fact that the black applicants were not all\ntold that apartments were not available, and that not all of them\nwere told that a \"credit check\" was necessary.\n*/ Appendix B to the District Court's findings does contain one\nminor error, in that the experiences of white checker Gross as to\navailability of apartments at Tan Plaza and Tan Plaza Continental\nwere inadvertently transposed. The answer should have been No at\nthe former complex and Yes at the latter. This error is of little\nconsequence, however, because the United States has only claimed\ndiscriminatory misrepresentation of availability at three buildings\n (Tan House, Tan Village and Tan Plaza International). While the\n1 '\ncorrection of the record at Tan Plaza and Tan Plaza Continental\nshows that Gross and his black counterpart were given similar in-\nformation as to availability at these two complexes, Appendix B\nalso discloses that the \"credit check ruse\" was discriminatorily\napplied at both of these buildings.\n\nBut the district judge did not find, nor did the United States\ncontend, that all black prospects at Tan buildings were given false\ninformation concerning the availability of apartments or that all\nblacks were told of a credit check requirement (see Appendix B, Cl. T.\nI 348). What we did contend, and what the Court did find, was that\nall of the black witnesses who visited Tan buildings were subjected\nto discriminatory treatment in one or other of these two ways.\nAt page 22 of their brief, after what purports to be a detailed\nanalysis of the portion of Appendix B which substantiates the dis-\ncriminatory use of the \"credit check ruse,\" appellants set forth\nsome statistics which they propose to substitute for the District\nCourt's findings and which are supposed to show that, even if every\nlegitimate doubt is resolved in favor of the United States, 20% of\nthe whites as compared with 46% of the blacks were subjected to a\ndelay by reports of a credit check. Even if appellants' figures were\ncorrect -- which they manifestly are not -- this would still be a\nsignificant difference. More important, however, Tan's substitute\n_ statistics are predicated on their factual contentions, which Judge\nWollenberg rejected on the basis of credibility choices, and on\ntheir contentions as to admissiblity, which the District Court\nproperly rejected.\nAppellants also argue that the proof of discriminatory mis-\nrepresentation of unavailability does not support the District\n■••\n\nCourt's findings with respect thereto because, so they allege\n(1) White tester Gross and black tester\nJohnson did not ask for the same kinds of\n*/\napartments;— and\n(2) Some of the apartments described as\navailable on defendants' records were not in\nfact available.\nThe District Court heard a substantial amount of testimony\nbearing on these asserted defenses and the rebuttal thereto by the\nUnited States. After appraising the testimony and documentary\nevidence,-including in particular appellants' attempted contradic-\ntions of their own records, the testimony of Mrs. Roberts as to\nhow easily furnished apartments were changed to unfurnished ones,\nMr. Tan's memorandum exhorting his agents not to leave any apartment\nvacant, if possible, longer than a day,(cid:9) and the proof that some\napartments represented as unavailable to blacks had been vacant for\nas long as five months, the District Judge rejected appellants'\n**/\nassertions on the basis of the evidence summarized in the appendix--\nto this brief, and we urge this Court to do the same.\n*/ Gross asked for furnished apartments and Johnson for unfurnished\nones at all complexes except Tan Plaza Continental.\n**/ Citations to the record are detailed in the appendix to this\nbrief.\n- 10-\n\nII. THE DISTRICT COURT CORRECTLY HELD THAT THE EVIDENCE OF\nAPPELLANTS' DISCRIMINATORY HOUSING PRACTICES ENTITLES\nTHE UNITED STATES TO THE RELIEF GRANTED\nThe Fair Housing Act of 1968 was enacted to eliminate from\nthe housing market badges and incidents of slavery which have\npersisted a century after the Thirteenth Amendment. United\nStates v. Bob Lawrence Realty Co., 474 F. 2d 115, 120 (5th Cir.\n1973), cert. den.(cid:9) U.S.(cid:9) , 42 L.W. 3195 (Oct. 9, 1973);\nsee also Jones v. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409 (1968); Mayers v.\nRidley, 465 F. 2d 630 (D.C. Cir. 1972) (en bane). In vindicat-\ning a policy which it considered to be of the highest national\npriority (Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S.\n205 (1972)), Congress declared its intention to provide \"within\nconstitutional limitations, for fair housing throughout the\nUnited States.\" 42 U.S.C. 3601. As the District Court held\nbelow, the language of the Act is so broad that \"all practices\nwhich have the effect of denying dwellings on prohibited grounds\nare therefore unlawful.\" United States v. Parma, P.H. E.O.H.\nRptr., Para. 13,616 (N.D. Ohio September 5, 1973); Zuch v.\n(cid:9)\nHussey, F. Supp. (cid:9) , C.A. No. 38757 (E.D. Mich. October 18,\n1973), slip opinion at p. 5.\n\nThe District Court found that appellants created a\npermissive atmosphere among their agents which in turn led to\nthe implementation of racially discriminatory rental practices.\nAfter hearing the testimony and observing the witnesses, the\ndistrict judge attributed these racially discriminatory results\nto the appellants and entered an order substantially along the\nlines of the one prescribed by the Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit in United States v. rest Peachtree Tenth Corn.,\n437 F. 2d 221, 229 et sec., (1971). In the light of the\nextensive proof of discrimination, we think the relief granted\nwas temperate and fully supported by findings which were in\nturn based on substantial evidence.\n- 12 -\n\nA. The evidence is sufficient to support the District Court's \nfindings that defendants engaged in a \"pattern and practice\"\nof discrimination and denied equal housing opportunity to \na \"group of persons.\"\nThe court below found that discriminatory instructions were\ngiven to, four employees ,—/(cid:9) that eight blacks were falsely told that\nno apartments were available, and that ten blacks were discouraged\nor otherwise deterred from renting apartments at Tan buildings through\n**/\nthe use of a \"credit check ruse.\"-- In addition, the Court explicitly\nfound that the rental agents carried out their superiors' discrimina-\n***/\ntory instructions,— and while the precise number of occasions on\n****/\nwhich this implementation was effected is not ascertainable;\nappellants' rental statistics speak for themselves.\n42 U.S.C. 3613 authorizes suit by the Attorney General where\nhe has reasonable cause to believe that defendants have engaged in\na discriminatory pattern or practice, or that there has been a denial\n*/ See also the testimony of Ken Romines (RT II 7-8, 9-16), who is in\neffect a fifth such witness.\n**/ Cl.

(RT I 48-49, 110-111; RT(cid:9) 163-168;\nP.Exh. 4(e) at pp. 7, 9-15). This evidence, like discrimination\nagainst identifiable blacks, is admissible to show a pattern or\npractice. United States v.

In United States v. Hunter, supra, 459 F. 2d at 218,\nnote 17, the court said:\nIn contrast to the 1964 Act, a pattern or\npractice of resistance is not an indispensable\nprerequisite for relief. Relief may be based\non a single (unintentional) violation of the\nAct when by that violation a group of persons\nare denied their statutory rights and the case\nraises an issue of general public importance.\nHere the rights of all non-whites looking for\nan apartment were abridged by the illegal\nadvertisements published in the Courier.\n*/ United States v.

I 337.\n- 15 -\n\nContrary to the implication in appellants' Question Presented\nNo. 8, it is well settled that the Attorney General's determination\nof general public importance is conclusive and not subject to\njudicial review. United States v. Bob Lawrence Realty Co.,\nsupra; United States v. Northside Realty Associates, 474 F. 2d\n1164 (5th Cir. 1973); and see note 6 to Conclusion of Law. No. 16\nin the District Court's opinion.\nIn United States v. Reddoch, supra, the Court of Appeals\naffirmed an opinion by Judge Pittman which summarized the law\nas to the \"second alternative\" of 42 U.S.C. 3613 as follows:\n\"To determine whether an injunction is\nappropriate under the \"second alternative\" of\n42 U.S.C. 3613, the court will apply conven-\n-•\ntional principles of equity. Injunctive relief\nis appropriate, in cases of this kind, where\nsignificant violations of the Act have been\nshown, irreparable injury being presumed from\nthe fact of such violations, without more.\nUnited States v.  Hayes International Corp.,\n415 F. 2d 1038 (5th Cir. 1969). Since equity\nlooks to the future, injunctive relief is also\nappropriate, even in the absence of a showing\nof past violations, where the defendants'\nconduct or statements threaten future vio-\nlations. Swift & Co., v. United States, 276\nU.S. 311, 326 (1928); United States v. W.T.\nGrant & Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633 (1953). Proof\nof discriminatory instructions to employees\nconstitutes a threat of future violations,\nand the same is true of admissions of a\ndiscriminatory policy. Injunctive relief\n- 16-\n\nis therefore appropriate in this case on the\nbasis of appellants' discriminatory rejection\nof blacks, standing alone, on the basis of\ntheir discriminatory instructions to Mrs.\nWard and Mrs. Robbins, standing alone, and\non the basis of their extrajudicial admis-\nsions of a discriminatory policy. The need\nfor such relief is even more cogent when\nall of these kinds of evidence are consid-\nered together.\"\nIn the light of the foregoing passage, the almost identical\nfacts in the present case are more than sufficient to support the\nrelief granted under the \"second alternative.\"\nB. The district court properly used statistical evidence to\nsupport its finding of discrimination.\nIt is now well settled that in housing discrimination\ncases,*/ -as well as those in cases involving other kinds of racial\ndiscrimination,**/ statistics tell much, and courts listen. The\nDistrict Court found that black occupancy of Tan buildings was\nnegligible, with the majority never having had a black tenant, and\nwith black occupancy of all Tan buildings at the time suit was\nbrought less than 1 1/2 percent of total occupancy.

The District Court properly held Appellants responsible \nfor the discriminatory conduct of their employees.\nAppellants claim on appeal that, even if their rental agents\nengaged in discriminatory rental practices, such conduct is not\nattributable to them because Mr. Tan assertedly had no knowledge\nof these violations. The law, however, is to the contrary. Judge\nWollenberg correctly concluded that the conduct of rental agents\nduring the course of their employment is chargeable to their\nprincipal both under the doctrine of respondeat  superior and because\n*/\nthe duty to obey the law is non-delegable.— If the discriminatory\nconduct of an agent acting on the principal's business were not\nimputed to the principal, the incentive for apartment owners to\nassure nondiscrimination by their agents would be removed, to the\ndetriment of \"the policy of the United States to provide fair housing\nthroughout the United States.\" 42 U.S.C. 3601.\n*/ See, e.g. United States v.

The proof\nshowed that the defendant had held regular meetings with his agents\non a daily or weekly basis to discuss the Fair Housing Act and to\nadmonish them to observe its provisions. The offending agents were\nnot joined as defendants. The Court of Appeals affirmed an injunc-\ntion against the defendant and all of his agents, holding that the\nproof was sufficient to show that the defendant had denied equal\nhousing opportunity to a group of persons and had participated with\nothers in a \"group pattern or practice\" of discrimination in the\n**/\narea.-- The defendant argued that the illegal conduct of the two\nagents should not be attributed to him and that he had done \"nothing\n*/ Appellants' citation of United States v.

The Supreme Court denied\ncertiorari.\nIn United States v. Reddoch, supra, an injunction was entered\nagainst all four members of a partnership which owned an apartment\nhouse on the basis of the resident manager's discriminatory conduct,\neven though two of the defendants were \"silent\" partners who lived\nin another city and who did not participate in the operation of the\napartments. The Court grounded its decision on the proposition\nthat the resident manager's discriminatory conduct was \"attributable\nto the defendants, who, at least, failed to take adequate steps to\nassure that she would comply with the law.\" United States v.\nReddoch, supra, Conclusion of Law No. 18. The Court of Appeals\naffirmed \"per curiam\", and subsequently denied a rehearing.\nIn enacting 42 U.S.C. 3604(a), Congress not only prohibited\nunlawful refusals to sell or rent a dwelling for racial reasons,\nbut also made it unlawful to make a dwelling unavailable on pro-\nhibited grounds. This catchall phraseology may not be easily dis-\ncounted or de-emphasized, and appears to be as broad as Congress\nama. \ncould have made it. United States v. City of Parma, l A land-\nlord makes housing unavailable to blacks when he delegates the\n-22-\n\nresponsibility for nondiscrimination to his agents and fails to\nassure compliance on their part. The consequences of such a course\nof conduct are the same as if he had engaged in personal discrimina-\ntory practices. To permit the landlord to abdicate his responsibility\nto assure equal housing opportunity by delegating his dealings with\ncustomers to others, where that results in blacks not obtaining\nhousing on an equal basis, would necessarily defeat the very policies\nunderlying the Fair Housing Act to which Congress has assigned so\nhigh a priority. Trafficrnte v. Metronolitan Life Ins. Co., supra.\nAppellants' contention that they cannot be held accountable\nfor any alleged discriminatory conduct by resident managers and\nrental agents because of a claimed lack of personal knowledge of\nsuch wrongdoings (Brief, pp. 42-45) seeks to avoid the central\nthrust of their legal obligation to assure nondiscrimination. Since\ntheir duty to comply with the law is nondelegable, United States v.\nReal Estate Devi, Corp ., supra, 347 F. Supp. at 785, it cannot be\nescaped by leaving everything to the discretion of subordinates who\nthen discriminate. The degree to which Mr. Tan supervised his\nemployees' actions was a matter of his own choice, and, in any event,\nhis knowledge was at least as great as that possessed by the defendants\n- 23,-\n\n*/\nin Lawrence, (cid:9) Reddoch, Real Estate Development Corp., and Marshall.\nIf trustees for the owner of an apartment building (Marshall) and\nsilent partners (Reddoch) can be held liable for their resident\nmanager's discriminatory activities, then a fortiori, an owner,\nlike Mr. Tan, who devoted considerable time to the day by day\noperations of his apartment complexes, (In'IV141-143,146-148,150-151, 156)\nalso violates the law when his agents do so.\n**/\nMr. Tan also contends that even if Mrs. Boatwright discriminated\nagainst blacks, he cannot he liable for her actions because she is\nno longer employed by him. This assertion is without merit. In\nthe first place, the District Court found instances of discrimina-\ntion proven at eight Tan buildings, and Mrs. Boatwright's discrimina-\ntion occurred only at the Americana. But even if the district court\nwere limited to a consideration of the events at the Americana --\nwhich it was not -- relief in equity cases is not limited to the\n*/ If a principal who gives regular instructions to his agents\nconcerning their obligations under the Fair Housing Act can be held\nliable for the misdeeds of his agents (Lawrence), then the same must\nbe true to a greater extent as to a principal like Tan, who claims\nto have given what the District Court termed \"perfunctory\" instruc-\ntions \"to obey the law\" to his agents at the outset of their employ-\nment. It is of note that at least seven or 1/3 of the agents called\nby Tan denied receiving such instructions. (RT III 356, 378-379;\nRT IV 36-37, 71-77).\n**/ The resident manager of the Americana. See Tan brief, pp. 46-47.\n-24 -\n\nparticular employee who did the discriminating. When his agent,\nMrs. Boatwright, discriminated, Tan discriminated. Since an injunc-\ntion against a principal is binding on all of his agents, see Rule\n65, F.R.Civ.P., and not merely on those who did the wrong imputed\nto the principal, the departure of Mrs. Boatwright does not obviate\n*/\nthe necessity for the decree.\nIn Hodgson v. First Fed!Savine-,s & Loan Assn. of Broward Co.,\nFla., 455 F. 2d 818, 826 (5th Cir. 1972), the District Court, after\nfinding discrimination because of age in the employment of a bank\nteller, issued an injunction prohibiting discrimination only in the\nOilw employment of tellers. The Court of Appeals held that the denial\nof a broader and more comprehensive injunction constituted an abuse\nof discretion:\n.(cid:9) . we find no legal justification in compart-\nmentalizing an employer corporation in order to\nwarrant an injunction against illegal employment\npractices to be applied only as to the particular\njob category in which the violation occurred.\nWhen confronted by a situation such as this\ncourts should not be loathe to issue injunctions\nof general applicability. See Wirtz v. Ocala\nGas Company, 336 F. 2d 236 (C.A. 5, 1964).\nThe aim of such an injunction is remedial, not\npunitive. McComb v. Jacksonville Paner Company,\n336 U.S. 187, 69 S.Ct. 497, 93 L.Ed. 599 (1949).\nAs this court said in a Fair Labor Standards\nAct case, 'The injunctive processes are a\n*/ In the Bob Lawrence case, supra, the defendant Mitchell,\nagainst whom an injunction was entered, was held liable primarily\non the basis of blockbusting representations by two agents who\nhad left the company.

Mitchell v. Pidcock,\nsupra, 299 F. 2d at 2870\n*\nWere the injunction in the instant case to\nbe limited to the hiring of tellers the govern-\nment would have to maintain its surveillance\nover defendant in order to insure that viola-\ntions of the Act in job categories other than\nteller did not occur. Having once made out\na case of unlawful discrimination, we think\nthe government should not have to bear this\nadministrative burden. This consideration,\nbalanced against the minimal inconvenience to\nthe defendant, weighs heavily in favor of\nenforcement by an injunction of general\napplicability without reference to specific\njobs.\nIn United States v. Real Estate Dev. Corp., supra, the Court,\nexpressly applying the First Fed. Savings & Loan Assn. decision to\nfair housing suits by the Attorney General, held that\nin cases of this kind, injunctions should not\nbe granted grudgingly and should be sufficiently\nbroad to assure nondiscrimination. 347 F. Supp.\nat 785.\nAs part of its decree, the Court made it clear that the injunction,\nwhich by its terms applied to all violations of Title VIII, was not\nlimited to the complexes at which the discrimination occurred, by\n- 26 -\n\nspecifically requiring the defendants to report to the Court\nimmediately upon the acquisition of additional residential\nproperty.— See also United States v. Gilman, 341 F. Supp. 891\n(S.D. N.Y. 1972) (two incidents at one building held sufficient\nto sustain prohibitory injunction as to all of defendants' build-\nings). The \"model decree\" in West Peachtree Tenth Corp. and the\ndecree affirmed by the Court of Appeals in Reddoch also prohibit\ndiscrimination generally, and are not limited to any particular\nbuilding.\nFinally, the District Court held that its \"paramount concern\"\nin a \"j5attern or practice\" case is the underlying violation by the\nprincipal in failing to exercise sufficient control over his agents\nto prevent them from discriminating at several of Tan's complexes.\nThat central theme of the violation was not affected by Mrs.\nBoatwright's departure.\n*/ The decree in the Real Estate Development case is not officially\nreporter, but may be found in P.H. E.O.H. Rptr. Para. 13,572, at\npp. 13,792 et seq.\n-27 -\n•\n\nD. The District Court's Order was a temperate exercise of\nits discretion and was not erroneous.\nWe have noted in our discussion of defendants' liability\nfor the conduct of their rental agents that the scope of an in-\njunction in this kind of case should not be unduly circumscribed.\n\"It was not necessary that all the untravelled roads [to violation\nof the law] be left open, and only the worn one closed.\"\nInternational Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 400 (1947).\nIndeed, in framing its decree, the District Court had:\n\"not merely the power but the duty to\nrender a decree which will so far as\npossible eliminate the discriminatory\neffects of the past as well as bar\nlike discrimination in the future.:\nLouisiana v. United States, 380 U.S. 145, 154 (1965). See also\nUnited States v. West Peachtree Tenth Corn_, supra.\nTan contends that injunctive relief is improper on the\ngrounds that he is in good faith and that there is therefore no\ndanger that he will violate the Act in the future. (Brief pp.\n46-47, 49-51). But once substantial violations have been proved,\nan injunction is appropriate to assure compliance. United States\nv. Bob Lawrence  Realty Inc., supra, 474 F. 2d at 125-126; see\nalso United States v. West Peachtree Tenth Corp., supra, 437 F.\n2d at 228. As Judge Dyer said for the Court of Appeals in\n-28 -\n\nWest Peachtree Tenth Corp., supra, in reversing the District\nCourt's denial of relief in that case as an abuse of discretion,\n.(cid:9) . the good faith and present disposition\nof the defendant to adhere to the letter and\nspirit of the law does not preclude us from\ngranting relief. Id. at 228.\nIf it was an abuse of discretion by the District Court in\nPeachtree not to enter an order like that prepared by the Court\nof Appeals, it was surely an appropriate exercise of Judge\n*/\nWollenberg's discretion to enter such a decree in this case.—\nTurning from the propriety of issuing any injunction to\nthe scope of an appropriate one, appellants contend that it was\nerror for the Discrict court (1) to require nondiscrimination in\nemployment in a Title VIII case (Brief, pp. 52-55) and (2) to\nrequire them to keep racial records concerning applicants for\napartments and to make reports to the court for three years\nrather than one year. (Id., pp. 55-56). We turn to these\ncontentions.\n1. The District Judge did not abuse his discretion \nin prohibiting Tan from engaging in discriminatory\nemployment practices.\n*/ It is noteworthy that the relief granted in this case does not\ninclude provisions which would have been within the Court's dis-\ncretion to grant, such as monetary relief for individual victims\nof discrimination, United States v. Georgia Power Co., 474 F. 2d\n906 (5th Cir. 1973), or a requirement that defendants attempt to\nattract nonwhite residents by advertising in nonwhite media.\nUnited States v. Ironworkers Local No. 86, supra.\n- 2g - .\n\nThe district judge found that with the exception of the\nproperty manager (Mr. Zee), who was Chinese, all of the persons\nwith rental duties in the Tan organization were white. (Cl. T.\nI. 325, Finding No. 3; see also Brief pp. 56-57). A virtually\nall-white work force, no matter how innocent its origin,*/\nreinforces the discriminatory all-white image which inevitably\nresults from the racially discriminatory conduct in which these\nappellants have been found to have engaged. Since appellants\nhave a legal obligation to correct their discriminatory image,\nUnited States v. Real Estate Dev. Corp., sutra; United States\nv. Plumbers Local No. 73 314 F. Supp. 160 (S.D. Ind. 1969), it\nwas within the district court's discretion, at least, to assure\nequal employment opportunity in Tan's operation, and courts in\nfair housing cases have consistently so held. See United  States\nv. Bob Lawrence Realty Co., supra, (appellate court affirmed\ninjunction in \"blockbusting\" case which required defendants to\ntake steps to assure nondiscrimination by their agents in\nemployment as well as housing, although no Title VII violations\nwere alleged or proved); United States v.

In addition,\nthe Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has issued Affir-\nmative Fair Housing Marketing Regulations pursuant to the Fair\nHousing Act, 37 F.R. 75, 76 (January 5, 1972), which explicitly\n*/\nrequire that developers under FHA subsidized and unsubsidized\nprograms \"maintain a nondiscriminatory hiring policy in recruiting\nfrom both minority and majority groups for staff engaged in the\nsale or rental of properties.\" This recognition by the officer\ncharged with the administration of Title VIII of the relevancy\nof employment practices to fair housing is entitled to great\nweight.

Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 15 (1965); Griggs v.\nDuke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971).\nNor is the approach represented by the foregoing authorities\nand adopted by the District Court out of step with the inter-\npretation of other civil rights laws. In the field of school\ndesegregation, it has long been settled that a black pupil seeking\nstudent desegregation has standing to complain of segregation of\n*/ We cite these Regulations not because the record shows the Tan\napartments to be subsidized, but rather to show the Secretary's\nrecognition of how employment practices affect equal housing oppor-\ntunity.\n- 31 -\n\nfaculties as well, even though no teacher has complained.\nBradley v. School Board, 382 U.S. 103, 105 (1965); Rovrs v.\nPaul, 382 U.S. 198, 200 (1965). As in school desegregation, so\ntoo in housing cases,\nFreedom of choice, in other words, does\nnot mean a choice between a clearly delineated\n\"Negro School\" (having an all-Negro faculty\nand staff) and a \"white school\" (with all-\nwhite faculty and staff). Kier v. County \nSchool Board of Augusta County, Va., 249\nF. Supp. 239, 246 Cd.D. Va. 1966).\nAs the late Judge Michie aptly put it in Brown v. County School\nBoard of Frederick County, Va., 245 F. Supp. 549, 560 (W.D. Va.\n1966), the presence of a faculty made up of members of one race\ndenotes the race of the pupils for which the school was intended\n\"just as certainly as if the [racial] words were printed across\nits entrance in six-inch letters.\"\nBy analogy to the foregoing, Tan's all-white rental staff,\nwhen considered in conjunction with the housing discrimination\nin which the District Court found appellants to have engaged,\ncreates a virtually all-white image, and the District Court\ncould reasonably conclude that such an image would have an adverse\ninfluence on a black applicant's choice. But \"if choice influ-\nencing factors are not eliminated, freedom of choice is a\nfantasy.\" Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, 267 F. Supp.\n- 32\n\n458, 479 (M.D. Ala. 1967), aff'd, sub nom Wallace v. United States\n389 U.S. 215 (1967). Accordingly, the District Court properly\nexercised its discretion in directing defendants to engage in\nnondiscriminatory employment practices, especially since the law\nrequired this of them in any event. Hodgson v. First Fed. Savings\nand Loan Assn. of Broward Co. Fla., supra.\n2. The three-year reporting period was not an\nabuse of discretion.\nDefendants argue that three years is too long a\nreporting period, and assert as grounds for this contention that\nthe testimony for the United States about discrimination -- which\nthe district judge found credible -- was allegedly unreliable.\nThis patent non-sequitur is hardly a basis for setting aside\nJudge Wollenberg's exercise of his discretion,  especially since\n42 U.S.C. 3613 authorizes permanent injunctive relief, while the\nreporting requirement is limited in duration. While  it is true\nthat reporting for two years was ordered in the West Peachtree\nTenth and Reddoch cases, each of those decisions involved discri-\nmination at a single apartment complex with  fewer than 100 units.\nThe detection of discrimination at a smaller operation would\nobviously be easier, without reporting, than at Tan's  relatively\n- 33-\n\nlarge holdings. Moreover, the amount of discrimination found in\nthe Tan case, whether computed in terms of the number of agents\nreporting discriminatory instructions or policies or in terms of\nthe number of incidents of discriminatory treatment of blacks, far\nsurpassed what was proved in either Reddoch or West Peachtree Tenth.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, we respectfully request that\nthe judgment of the District Court be in all respects affirmed.\nRespectfully submitted,\n(cid:9)\nJAMES L.
