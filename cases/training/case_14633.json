    "summary": "<p>On June 17, 2015, this class action was filed in Idaho's District Court of the Fourth Judicial District against the State of Idaho, Idaho Governor C.L. Otter, and seven Public Defense Commission (PDC) members. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and private counsel, proceeded under 42 U.S.C. §1983 and state law, and alleged violation of their Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to adequate legal counsel, a right also guaranteed under the Idaho Constitution (Art. 1 §13). The suit claimed that Idaho maintained an unconstitutional public defender system wherein thousands enter a defective criminal justice system that is overburdened and underresourced. In particular, plaintiffs claimed that they had to go before a judge for bail hearings, and even enter pleas of guilty and be sentenced, all without a lawyer present; they often faced bail amounts too high for them to pay. </p><p>The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief which would require the state to obtain court approval of “a plan to develop and implement a statewide system of public defense that is consistent with the U.S. Constitution and the Constitution and laws of the State of Idaho,” including systems to ensure uniform standards related to attorney workload, performance, and training.</p><p>The defendants filed a motion to dismiss shortly after the complaint was filed and on January 20, 2016, Judge Samuel A. Hoagland dismissed the case, finding that the defendants were protected by sovereign immunity and that justiciability doctrines (standing, ripeness, and separation of powers) barred the claim. The plaintiffs appealed on January 25, 2016 to the Idaho Supreme Court. On May 12, 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an amicus brief supporting the plaintiffs and recommending that the Idaho Supreme Court reverse the district court's dismissal because the ruling \"has deprived indigent defendants in Idaho\" of an essential tool to enforce their constitutional rights.</p><p>On April 28, 2017, the Idaho Supreme Court reversed the dismissal as to the state of Idaho and the PDC, but affirmed as to the Governor. In particular, the Court found: that sovereign immunity in the state court was a common law doctrine, and that it was inapplicable when constitutional violations were alleged, and also that the plaintiffs had standing, their claims were ripe, and that their requested relief would not implicate the separation of powers doctrine. The Court stated that the right to counsel was not entrusted to any particular branch of government and just because three branches may collaborate when deciding how to ensure a public defender system is constitutional does not itself implicate a separation of powers issue.  394 P.3d 54.</p><p>The Idaho Supreme Court remanded the case and did not award attorney fees or costs on appeal because the merits of the claim still needed to be addressed.</p><p>After the case was remanded back to the Idaho District Court and Judge Samuel A. Hoagland, the plaintiffs filed a first amended class action complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief and supplemental pleading against the State of Idaho and the current seven members of the PDC in their official capacities. </p><p>On January 17, 2018, after holding a hearing on the motion for class certification one month before, the district court certified a class of:<blockquote>all indigent persons who are now or who will be under formal charge before a state court in Idaho of having committed any offense, the penalty for which includes the possibility of confinement, incarceration, imprisonment, or detention in a correction facility (regardless of whether actually imposed) and who are unable to provide for the full payment of an attorney and all other necessary expenses of representation in defending against the charge.</blockquote>The court rejected the defendants' contention that the dissimilarities of experiences with public defenders among the class were too great to allow class certification. Instead, the court explained that commonality was satisfied by numerous questions common to every member of the class, including: whether the State is currently providing constitutionally sufficient representation for indigent defendants in their respective jurisdictions; whether the State has violated the United States and Idaho Constitutions by failing to implement, administer, and oversee adequate public defense systems; whether, by abdicating its responsibility to adequately fund, supervise, and administer indigent defense services to the counties, the State has failed to ensure that indigent defendants are provided with effective legal representation, all in violation of the United States and Idaho Constitutions. </p><p>Following this, both parties moved for summary judgment on November 20, 2018. One of the central issues presented by the cross motions was what the appropriate legal standard the plaintiffs would have to meet in order to prevail on their systemic challenge to Idaho's indigent public defense system. </p><p>On March 19, 2019, the district court denied both parties' motions, and instead, under Idaho Appellate Rule 12(c)(2), issued an order recommending permission to appeal from an interlocutory order. The court explained that an immediate appeal was necessary to materially advance the litigation given the substantial confusion over the standard to be applied and the fact that the issue presents a matter of first impression.</p><p>The litigation was stayed, and will proceed on appeal if the Idaho Supreme Court accepts the district court's recommendation. As of April 17, 2019, the Idaho Supreme Court has not acted on this recommendation, and the litigation is ongoing. </p><p></p>",

The Court \nlater made clear that the guarantee of counsel’s assistance extends to all criminal \ndefendants faced with incarceration, including those charged with misdemeanors,  \nsee Alabama v. Shelton, 535 U.S. 654, 661-662 (2002), as well as to juveniles in \ndelinquency proceedings, In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 34-42 (1967).1  Under Gideon \nand its progeny, it is the State’s responsibility to ensure that “any person haled into \ncourt, who is too poor to hire a lawyer,” be provided counsel to assist in his \ndefense.  Gideon, 372 U.S. at 344. \nThis case asks how indigent criminal defendants may vindicate that Sixth \nAmendment right when systemic, structural deficiencies in a State’s public \ndefender system result in counsel being assigned in name only.  In ruling plaintiffs’ \nclaims nonjusticiable, the district court effectively held that the sole recourse \n                                           \n1  For simplicity, this brief uses “Gideon” as shorthand for the Court’s \nrecognition of the right to counsel in felony, misdemeanor, and juvenile contexts. \n- 1 - \n \n\n     \nplaintiffs have to redress the systemic deficiencies in Idaho’s public defense \nsystem is through piecemeal, post-conviction litigation of individual ineffective-\nassistance-of-counsel claims under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).  \nThat was error.  Rather, as the Court of Appeals of New York correctly recognized \nin Hurrell-Harring v. State, 930 N.E.2d 217 (N.Y. 2010), indigent criminal \ndefendants may challenge systemic Gideon violations through pre-conviction, civil \nconstructive-denial-of-counsel claims seeking prospective injunctive relief.   \nThe availability of pre-conviction civil actions for systemic denials of \ncounsel, whether actual or constructive, is critical to protecting the fundamental \nright that Gideon recognized.  In ruling that courts are powerless to hear such \nclaims, the district court has deprived indigent defendants in Idaho of this essential \ntool, well-grounded in the law, for enforcing their constitutional right to counsel.  \nThis Court should correct that error. \nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES \nThe United States has a strong interest in ensuring that all jurisdictions— \nfederal, state, and local—fulfill their constitutional obligation to provide counsel to \ncriminal defendants and juveniles facing incarceration who cannot afford an \nattorney, as required by Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963), and In re \n- 2 - \n\n     \nGault, 387 U.S. 1 (1967).  In March 2010, the Department of Justice (the \nDepartment) established the Office for Access to Justice (the Office) to address the \ncrisis in indigent defense services.  The Office coordinates the Department’s \nefforts to improve indigent defense.2  Attorney General Loretta Lynch has \nemphasized the importance of fulfilling Gideon’s promise, stating “that this \nDepartment of Justice and this entire administration will continue to  *  *  *  do \neverything in our power to further th[e] important mission” of “ensuring that in the \nUnited States there is indeed no price tag on justice.”3     \nThe Department of Justice enforces the right to counsel in juvenile \ndelinquency proceedings under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement \nAct of 1994, 42 U.S.C. 14141.  For example, in December 2012, the Department \nentered into a comprehensive memorandum of agreement with Shelby County, \nTennessee, that requires the county, among other things, to appoint counsel for \n                                           \n2  Office for Access to Justice, http://www.justice.gov/atj (last visited Apr. \n26, 2016).   \n \n3  Attorney General Loretta E.

Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963).14 \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThis is a class action lawsuit alleging that systemic failings in Idaho’s public \ndefender system have resulted, and will continue to result, in the constructive \ndenial of counsel for indigent criminal defendants in violation of the Sixth and \nFourteenth Amendments.  (R., pp. 26, 56-57).  The named plaintiffs are four \ncriminal defendants awaiting trial or sentencing who are unable to afford counsel \n                                           \n13  See generally Office for Access to Justice, Accomplishments (last updated \nApr. 6, 2016), http://www.justice.gov/atj/accomplishments. \n \n14  The United States takes no position on the merits of this particular case or \non any issues of state law.   \n- 7 - \n\n     \nand who allege to have experienced numerous deficiencies in their appointed \nrepresentation, including but not limited to:  \n•  the wholesale absence of counsel at initial appearances, resulting in \nplaintiffs’ inability to argue for reduced bail and, consequently, \nunnecessary or extended pretrial detention;15  \n•  the inability to meet or communicate with their assigned lawyer to \nkeep apprised of their case’s progress and participate in the \ndevelopment of their defense;  \n•  the lack of meaningful investigation into their cases;  \n•  the failure to file substantive motions on their behalf; and   \n•  the lack of funds to retain necessary experts to challenge the \nprosecution’s allegations. \n(R., pp. 8-12, 27-33).  Plaintiff Tracy Tucker, for example, alleges that his \nappointed attorney did not attend his initial appearance, at which the court set a \n$40,000 bail; that during Tucker’s three months in jail, he met with his attorney \n                                           \n15  Unlike in the federal system, Idaho Criminal Rule 44(a) entitles indigent \ndefendants to appointed counsel at their initial appearance.   \n- 8 - \n\n     \nonly three times—two of which occurred during court appearances—for a total of \n20 minutes; that while in custody he made more than 50 unsuccessful attempts to \nreach his attorney by telephone; and that, as of ten days before Tucker’s trial date, \nhis attorney had not conducted any meaningful investigation into his case nor \ndiscussed relevant discovery materials or trial strategy with Tucker.  (R., pp. 8-9).  \nThe other named plaintiffs allege similar experiences.  (R., pp. 9-12).   \nPlaintiffs allege that these circumstances “exemplify the experiences of \nthousands of indigent defendants across the State.”  (R., p. 12).  They also allege \nthat these deficiencies are the result of systemic, structural problems in the State’s \nindigent defense system, including but not limited to: \n•  caseloads that far exceed national standards; \n•  insufficient funding; \n•  lack of meaningful oversight, training, performance standards, \nsupervision, or evaluation by the State of county-provided public \ndefense services;16  \n                                           \n16  By statute, Idaho has delegated responsibility for providing indigent \ncriminal defense to its 44 counties.  Idaho Code Ann. § 19-859 (2015). \n- 9 - \n\n     \n•  lack of independence from local boards of commissioners, which \ncontrol public defender hiring and firing, funding, and resources for \ninvestigators and experts; and  \n•  the continued use in many areas of “fixed-fee contracts,” which create \nincentives for appointed attorneys to spend as little money and time as \npossible on indigent clients’ cases, despite the fact that such contracts \nare prohibited by Idaho Code § 19-859(4). \n(R., pp. 22-26, 42-52, 55).   \nPlaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and those similarly situated, sued the \nGovernor of Idaho and the seven members of the Idaho Public Defense \nCommission (PDC),17 all in their official capacities, seeking declaratory and \n                                           \n17  The PDC is an executive agency established by statute in 2014.  Idaho \nCode Ann. § 19-849 (2015).  The PDC is responsible for promulgating rules for \ntraining, continuing legal education, and data-reporting requirements for public \ndefenders.  Id. § 19-850(1)(a).  It is also required by statute to hold quarterly \nmeetings and to make yearly recommendations to the Idaho legislature regarding \nlegislation to improve the public defense system.  Id. § 19-850(1)(b)-(c).  Although \nthe statute required the PDC to submit its first recommendations by January 20, \n2015, plaintiffs allege that the PDC had failed to make any such recommendations \nby the time they filed their complaint in June 2015.  (R., p. 24). \n- 10 - \n\n     \ninjunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. 1983 and state law.18  (R., pp. 33-34, 56-58).  \nAmong other relief requested, plaintiffs asked the court to enter an injunction \n“requiring the State to propose, for th[e] Court’s approval and monitoring,” both a \ngeneral “plan to develop and implement a statewide system of public defense that” \ncomplies with the Constitution and, more specifically, “uniform workload, \nperformance, and training standards for attorneys representing indigent criminal \ndefendants in the State of Idaho in order to ensure accountability and monitor \neffectiveness.”  (R., p. 58).  Plaintiffs also asked the court to enforce the Idaho \nstatute “barring the use of fixed-fee contracts in the delivery of indigent-defense \nservices.”  (R., p. 58).  \nDefendants moved to dismiss the complaint.  On January 20, 2016, the \nDistrict Court of the Fourth Judicial District of the State of Idaho granted \ndefendants’ motion to dismiss.  (R., pp. 468-501).  The court rejected defendants’ \nargument that the Governor and PDC members are not proper parties to the Section \n                                           \n18  Although the complaint also named the State of Idaho as a defendant, the \ndistrict court dismissed the federal claims against the State upon plaintiffs’ \nconcession that a State is not a “person” for purposes of 42 U.S.C. 1983.  (R., p. \n481).   \n- 11 - \n\n     \n1983 suit, holding that they “have a more than sufficiently close connection” to the \n“enforcement of public defense in Idaho.”  (R., p. 485).  The court held, however, \nthat plaintiffs’ claims are not justiciable for three interrelated reasons:  that \nplaintiffs lack standing, the case is not ripe, and the relief plaintiffs request would \nrequire the court to invade the province of the legislature.     \nFirst, misconstruing plaintiffs’ complaint as alleging a “violation of their \nright to effective assistance of counsel” under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. \n668 (1984), the court concluded that plaintiffs lack standing to bring such a \nchallenge because they have not yet been convicted or sentenced and thus can \nshow no injury in fact that could be redressed by a court.  (R., pp. 487-492).  The \ncourt also concluded that the deficiencies that plaintiffs allege are not “causally \nconnected” to defendants’ inaction because neither the Governor nor the PDC “has \nthe power and authority to act alone to redress Plaintiffs’ grievances”—a holding \nseemingly in tension with the court’s conclusion that the Governor and PDC \nmembers are proper defendants to the Section 1983 action.  (R., pp. 489-490).    \n  Second, the court concluded that plaintiffs’ claims are “not ripe for \nadjudication” for the same reason it held that they lack standing:  namely, that they \nhave not yet been convicted or sentenced.  (R., pp. 493-494).  The court noted that, \n- 12 - \n\n     \nshould plaintiffs ultimately be convicted, they could pursue post-conviction relief \nfor ineffective assistance of counsel “[i]n each of their individual cases,” and that if \na court finds “that their constitutional rights have been violated,” it could “order a \nspecific remedy” such as “a new trial or dismissal of the case.”  (R., p. 494).     \n    Finally, the court concluded that granting plaintiffs’ requested relief would \n“invade the province of the legislature” because it would require the court both to \n“legislate specific standards” that the State must meet to comply with the \nConstitution and to order the Governor and PDC “to provide adequate funding” to \nmeet those standards.  (R., pp. 496-498).  In the court’s view, the proper role of the \njudiciary is to “find[] and redress violations of constitutional rights in individual \ncases,” not to ensure that governmental institutions “comply with the laws and the \nConstitution” on a systemic basis.  (R., p. 498). \n  Plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal on January 25, 2016, see I.A.R. \n14(a), and filed their brief with this Court on April 29, 2016.     \n \n \n \n \n \n- 13 - \n\n     \nARGUMENT \nA PRE-CONVICTION CIVIL CLAIM FOR CONSTRUCTIVE DENIAL OF \nCOUNSEL UNDER GIDEON IS COGNIZABLE AND CONCEPTUALLY \nDISTINCT FROM A POST-CONVICTION CLAIM FOR INEFFECTIVE \nASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL UNDER STRICKLAND \n   \nA.  A State Violates Gideon If Systemic Structural Limitations Preclude \nAppointed Counsel From Providing Indigent Defendants The “Assistance” \nThe Constitution Guarantees       \n \n  The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution provides that “[i]n all criminal \nprosecutions, the accused shall  *  *  *  have the Assistance of Counsel for his \ndefense.”  U.S. Const. Amend. VI.  In Gideon v. Wainwright, the United States \nSupreme Court held that this right requires States to appoint attorneys to \ndefendants charged with felonies who cannot afford to retain counsel.  372 U.S. \n335, 344 (1963).  The Court explained that “lawyers in criminal courts are \nnecessities, not luxuries.”  Ibid.; see also Luis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 1083, \n1088 (2016) (“No one doubts the fundamental character of a criminal defendant’s \nSixth Amendment right to the ‘Assistance of Counsel.’”).  This Court has echoed \nthat principle.  See, e.g., Stuart v. State, 801 P.2d 1283, 1285 (Idaho 1990) (stating \nthat “the constitutional right to assistance of counsel” is “fundamental and is not a \nluxury”), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1234 (1996).   \n- 14 - \n\n     \nA State does not satisfy its obligation under Gideon simply by appointing \nlawyers to indigent defendants.  See Avery v. Alabama, 308 U.S. 444, 446 (1940) \n(the “mere formal appointment” of a lawyer does not satisfy the constitutional right \nto counsel).  Rather, those lawyers must be appointed under circumstances that \npermit them to do their jobs.  As the United States Supreme Court has explained, \nthe Sixth Amendment “requires not merely the provision of counsel to the accused, \nbut ‘Assistance,’ which is to be ‘for his defen[s]e.’”  United States v. Cronic, 466 \nU.S. 648, 654 (1984).  That right would be “an empty formality” if appointed \ncounsel is precluded from providing his or her client any meaningful \nrepresentation.  Ungar v. Sarafite, 376 U.S. 575, 589 (1964).         \nThe United States Supreme Court has thus long recognized that, even where \na defendant has been formally appointed a lawyer, the right to counsel may be \nconstructively denied.  In Powell v. Alabama, for example, the Court held that the \ndefendants “were not accorded the right of counsel in any substantial sense” where \ncounsel was not assigned until the morning of trial.  287 U.S. 45, 58 (1932).  \nObserving that it would be “vain” to give a defendant a lawyer “without giving the \nlatter any opportunity to acquaint himself with the facts or law of the case,” id. at \n59 (citation omitted), the Court concluded that the duty to appoint counsel “is not \n- 15 - \n\n     \ndischarged by an assignment at such a time or under such circumstances as to \npreclude the giving of effective aid in the preparation and trial of the case,” id. at \n71.  Similarly, in Avery v. Alabama, the Court recognized that “the Constitution’s \nguarantee of assistance of counsel cannot be satisfied by mere formal \nappointment.”  308 U.S. at 446.  If appointed counsel is denied the opportunity “to \nconfer, to consult with the accused and to prepare his defense,” the Court observed, \nthen the appointment of counsel becomes “a sham and nothing more than a formal \ncompliance with the Constitution’s requirement that an accused be given the \nassistance of counsel.”  Ibid.  And in United States v. Cronic, the Court explained \nthat there may be circumstances, such as in Powell, where “although counsel is \navailable to assist the accused during trial, the likelihood that any lawyer, even a \nfully competent one, could provide effective assistance is so small that a \npresumption of prejudice is appropriate without inquiry into the actual conduct of \nthe trial.”  466 U.S. at 659-660.19          \n                                           \n19  In Cronic and Avery, unlike in Powell, the Court ultimately concluded \nthat the right to counsel was not violated, notwithstanding the late appointment of \ncounsel.  See Cronic, 466 U.S. at 665; Avery, 308 U.S. at 450-453.  The Court \ndetermined that, in the particular circumstances of those cases, the appointed \n(continued…) \n \n- 16 - \n\n     \nA claim that a defendant has been denied the assistance of counsel in \nviolation of the Sixth Amendment—whether actually or constructively—is \nconceptually distinct from a claim that his lawyer’s performance was \nconstitutionally ineffective.  See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 692 \n(1984) (distinguishing between ineffectiveness claims and claims of “[a]ctual or \nconstructive denial of the assistance of counsel”).  An ineffective-assistance-of-\ncounsel claim—sometimes called a Strickland claim, for the landmark case that \nestablished the doctrine—focuses on the lawyer’s handling of the individual \ndefendant’s case.  To prevail on such a claim, the defendant must show both that \nhis lawyer’s performance “fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,” id. \nat 688, and that “there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s \nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,” id. \nat 694.          \n                                           \n(…continued) \nlawyers were able to subject the government’s theory to adversarial testing and \nthus were not merely formal appointments.  But in this case, as in other systemic \nconstructive-denial-of-counsel claims, plaintiffs allege that the counsel assigned to \nindigent defendants are not subjecting the government’s theories to meaningful \nadversarial testing nor providing other traditional markers of representation. \n- 17 - \n\n     \nIn a denial-of-counsel claim, by contrast, “the defendant alleges not that \ncounsel made specific errors in the course of representation, but rather that during \nthe judicial proceeding he was—either actually or constructively—denied the \nassistance of counsel altogether.”  Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 483 (2000).  \n“This is quite different from a case in which it is claimed that counsel’s \nperformance was ineffective.”  Penson v. Ohio, 488 U.S. 75, 88 (1988).  A denial-\nof-counsel claim is an assertion not of substandard representation but of \nnonrepresentation.  As the cases demonstrate, moreover, the Court does not \ndistinguish between actual and constructive denials of counsel.  Having counsel \nthat can provide no real “assistance” is tantamount to not having counsel at all.  In \na denial-of-counsel claim, no individualized showing of prejudice is required, as \n“[a]ctual or constructive denial of the assistance of counsel altogether is legally \npresumed to result in prejudice.”  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 692; accord Cronic, 466 \nU.S. at 658-660.         \nIt follows that, to comply with Gideon, the State must do more than simply \nappoint a member of the bar to stand alongside an indigent defendant at trial.  If \nsystemic, structural conditions are such that appointed counsel functions as counsel \n- 18 - \n\n     \nin name only, the State has not provided the “assistance” of counsel that Gideon \nand the Sixth Amendment require. \nB.  Courts That Have Considered The Issue Have Recognized That A Pre-\nConviction Civil Claim For Constructive Denial Of Counsel Is Cognizable \n \n  Plaintiffs allege that the failures in Idaho’s indigent defense system have \nresulted, and will continue to result, in “the constructive denial of counsel” for \nthem and those similarly situated.  (R., p. 56).  The question before this Court is \nwhether plaintiffs can bring such a constructive-denial-of-counsel claim in a pre-\nconviction civil action seeking prospective injunctive relief, or whether, as the \ndistrict court held, they must wait until they are convicted and sentenced (if they \nare) and raise their challenge in the form of separate, post-conviction ineffective-\nassistance claims seeking individual relief.      \nThis Court should reverse the district court’s ruling and hold that pre-\nconviction civil claims alleging systemic constructive denials of counsel are \nactionable.  Plaintiffs’ complaint is not with their individual lawyers’ competence \nbut with the State’s alleged failure, on a system-wide level, to meet “its \nfoundational obligation under Gideon to provide legal representation” to \ndefendants who cannot afford it.  Hurrell-Harring v. State, 930 N.E.2d 217, 222 \n- 19 - \n\n     \n(N.Y. 2010).  There is no legal bar to bringing such a claim in a civil suit outside \nthe context of a final conviction and sentence; indeed, a pre-trial civil action \nseeking prospective, injunctive relief is the only judicial mechanism by which a \ncourt can find and remedy a State’s systemic noncompliance with Gideon.  \nHurrell-Harring is the leading case recognizing a civil constructive-denial-\nof-counsel claim, and it is correctly reasoned.  The court in that case recognized a \nconstructive denial-of-counsel claim under Gideon that is distinct from an \nineffective-assistance claim under Strickland.  The court determined that, “[g]iven \nthe simplicity and autonomy of a claim for nonrepresentation, as opposed to one \ntruly involving the adequacy of an attorney’s performance, there is no reason  \n*  *  *  why such a claim cannot or should not be brought without the context of a \ncompleted prosecution.”  930 N.E.2d at 225-226.  The court recognized that \nlimiting this type of claim to an action for post-conviction relief would prevent \ncourts from effectively remedying systemic Gideon violations.  The court \nexplained that “the fairly minimal risks involved in sustaining the closely defined \nclaim of nonrepresentation we have recognized must be weighed [against] the very \nserious dangers that the alleged denial of counsel entails.”  Id. at 226.   \n- 20 - \n\n     \n  The court in Wilbur v. City of Mount Vernon, No. 2:11-CV-1100, 2012 WL \n600727 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 23, 2012) (Wilbur I), followed a similar analysis.  Like \nthe Hurrell-Harring court, it recognized that plaintiffs’ suit did not allege \nineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland, but rather asserted a systemic \ndeprivation of the right to counsel promised in Gideon.  Id. at *2.  The Wilbur \ncourt found that the facts that plaintiffs asserted could support a finding “that the \nassignment of public defenders is little more than a sham,” ibid., and concluded \nthat a civil action seeking a systemic remedy was appropriate for such allegations, \nexplaining that “[w]here official government policies trample rights guaranteed by \nthe Constitution, the courts have not hesitated to use their equitable powers to \ncorrect the underlying policies or systems,” id. at *3.  See also Duncan v. State, \n774 N.W.2d 89, 127-128 (Mich. Ct. App. 2009) (concluding that plaintiffs state a \nvalid civil claim where they allege an actual denial of counsel, a constructive \ndenial of counsel, or conflicted counsel); Luckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d 1012, 1018 \n(11th Cir. 1988) (concluding that a civil Sixth Amendment claim was cognizable \nwhere plaintiffs asserted, among other things, “systemic delays in the appointment \nof counsel,” that their attorneys are denied the resources necessary to investigate \n- 21 - \n\n     \ntheir cases, and that attorneys are pressured to hurry cases to trial and to enter \nguilty pleas).20   \n  In ruling plaintiffs’ claims nonjusticiable in this case, the district court \nmisapprehended the conceptual distinction between pre-conviction, systemic \nconstructive-denial-of-counsel claims under Gideon and post-conviction, \nindividual ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims under Strickland.  The court \nconcluded that plaintiffs’ complaint neither presents a live case or controversy nor \nis ripe for adjudication because “none of the Plaintiffs ha[s] either been convicted \nor sentenced” (R., p. 489) and thus none can show the actual prejudice necessary to \nmake out an ineffective-assistance claim under Strickland (R., p. 492).  Plaintiffs’ \nclaim, however, is not that their appointed lawyers have provided constitutionally \nineffective assistance in their individual cases.  Rather, their claim is that \nstructural, systemic deficiencies in Idaho’s indigent defense system have, for them \nand others similarly situated, resulted in “the constructive denial of counsel” in \nviolation of the Sixth Amendment and Gideon v. Wainwright.  (R., p. 56).  As the \n                                           \n20  This case was dismissed on remand based on abstention grounds under \nYounger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971).  See Luckey v. Miller, 976 F.2d 673, 675 \n(11th Cir. 1992).  But the Eleventh Circuit’s initial opinion remains good law. \n- 22 - \n\n     \ncourts in Hurrell-Harring and Wilbur I correctly recognized, such pre-conviction \nGideon claims are not only cognizable but provide a crucial vehicle for rectifying \nsystemic right-to-counsel violations in a way that individual, post-conviction \nStrickland claims cannot.   \nThe district court was also incorrect to conclude that granting systemic, \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief of the sort plaintiffs request would violate \nseparation-of-powers principles.  Courts are not powerless to compel action by \nother branches of government in order to remedy a constitutional violation.  To the \ncontrary, courts have long recognized the necessity of systemic equitable relief to \ncorrect unconstitutional conduct.  See, e.g., Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493 (2011).  \nAs the Hurrell-Harring court observed, “enforcement of a clear constitutional or \nstatutory mandate is the proper work of the courts.”  930 N.E.2d at 227.  Thus, the \npossibility “that a remedy in this action would necessitate the appropriation of \nfunds and perhaps, particularly in a time of scarcity, some reordering of legislative \npriorities” does not relieve the court “of its essential obligation to provide a remedy \nfor violation of a fundamental constitutional right.”  Ibid. (citing Marbury v. \nMadison, 5 U.S. 137, 147 (1803)).  \n- 23 - \n\n     \nMoreover, contrary to the trial court’s assertion, plaintiffs’ request for relief \ndoes not ask the court to enact legislation or otherwise “shape the institutions of \ngovernment” to bring them into compliance with the Constitution.  (R., p. 498).  \nRather, plaintiffs seek injunctions “requiring the State to propose” a plan for \nreforming its public defense system.  (R., p. 58 (emphasis added)).  Under \nplaintiffs’ proposal, the court’s role would be to approve and monitor the State’s \nplan to ensure that it meets constitutional standards.  (R., p. 58); see Swann v. \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 15 (1971) (“Once a right and a \nviolation have been shown, the scope of a district court’s equitable powers to \nremedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable \nremedies.”); see also Wilbur v. City of Mount Vernon, 989 F. Supp. 2d 1122, 1133-\n1137 (W.D. Wash. 2013) (Wilbur II) (entering continuing injunction against \nmunicipalities for systemic deprivations of the constitutional right to counsel).  In \nany event, any concerns regarding the court’s role vis-à-vis the legislature at most \ngo to the scope of relief the court might fashion; they do not render the claim \nnonjusticiable, as the court ruled here. \n \n- 24 - \n\n     \nC.  Constructive Denial Of Counsel Violating Gideon Occurs Where The \nTraditional Markers Of Representation Are Frequently Absent Or \nSignificantly Compromised As A Result Of Systemic, Structural Limitations  \n \nA civil claim for prospective, systemic relief based on constructive denial of \ncounsel is viable:  (1) when, on a system-wide basis, the traditional markers of \nrepresentation—such as timely and confidential consultation with clients, \nappropriate investigation, and meaningful adversarial testing of the prosecution’s \ncase—are absent or significantly compromised; and (2) when substantial structural \nlimitations—such as a severe lack of resources, unreasonably high workloads, or \ncritical understaffing of public defender offices—cause that absence or limitation \non representation.  When the totality of the circumstances indicates that structural \nlimitations are causing a system-wide problem of nonrepresentation, indigent \ncriminal defendants may seek prospective, systemic relief in a civil suit to protect \nthe constitutional right to counsel of the class that they represent. \n  Courts assessing a constructive-denial-of-counsel claim should, therefore, \nfirst consider whether traditional markers of representation are typically present for \nclients of publicly appointed attorneys.  These include the attorneys’ availability to \nengage in meaningful attorney-client contact to learn from and advise their clients; \nthe attorneys’ ability to investigate the allegations and the clients’ circumstances \n- 25 - \n\n     \nthat may inform strategy; and the attorneys’ ability to advocate for clients either \nthrough plea negotiation, at trial, or post-trial.  When these markers of \nrepresentation are absent, there is a serious question whether the assigned counsel \nis merely a lawyer in name only.  Indeed, “[a]ctual representation assumes a \ncertain basic representational relationship.”  Hurrell-Harring, 930 N.E.2d at 224 \n(emphasis added); see also Wilbur II, 989 F. Supp. 2d at 1124 (finding that, where \nclients met their attorneys for the first time in court and immediately accepted a \nplea bargain without discussing their cases in a confidential setting, the system \n“amounted to little more than a ‘meet and plead’ system,” and that the resulting \nlack of representational relationship violated the Sixth Amendment); Public \nDefender, Eleventh Jud. Cir. of Fla. v. State, 115 So. 3d 261, 278 (Fla. 2013) \n(finding denial of counsel where attorneys were “mere conduits for plea offers,” \ndid not communicate with clients, were unable to investigate the allegations, and \nwere unprepared for trial). \n  If such markers of traditional representation are typically absent or \nsignificantly compromised, courts should determine whether such absence is \ncaused by systemic structural limitations.  Factors to consider include insufficient \nfunding, insufficient staffing, excessive workloads, lack of training and \n- 26 - \n\n     \nsupervision, lack of independence, and lack of resources.  In Wilbur II, for \nexample, the court noted the structural limitations—insufficient staffing, excessive \ncaseloads, and almost nonexistent supervision—that resulted in a system “broken \nto such an extent that confidential attorney/client communications are rare, the \nindividual defendant is not represented in any meaningful way, and actual \ninnocence could conceivably go unnoticed and unchampioned.”  989 F. Supp. 2d at \n1127.  Similarly, the court in Public Defender held that the public defender’s office \ncould withdraw from representation of indigent defendants because of structural \nlimitations.  115 So. 3d at 282.  Insufficient funds and the resultant understaffing \nand excessive caseloads created a situation where indigent defendants did not \nreceive assistance of counsel as required by the Sixth Amendment.  Id. at 278.  \nOther courts have also concluded that severe structural limitations result in a denial \nof the right to counsel.  See, e.g., New York Cnty. Lawyers’ Ass’n v. State, 196 \nMisc. 2d 761, 790 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2003) (holding statutory rates for assigned \ncounsel unconstitutional as they resulted in denial of counsel and excessive \ncaseloads, among other issues); State v. Young, 172 P.3d 138, 144 (N.M. 2007) \n(holding that inadequate compensation of defense attorneys deprived capital \ndefendants of their Sixth Amendment right to counsel); cf. Luis, 136 S. Ct. at 1095 \n- 27 - \n\n     \n(observing that increasing the workload of already “overworked and underpaid \npublic defenders” risks “render[ing] less effective the basic right the Sixth \nAmendment seeks to protect”). \nStructural limitations can lead to a situation where even a well-intentioned \nand competent lawyer is merely nominal counsel because the lawyer is unable to \nfulfill the basic obligation of preparing a defense, including conferring with the \ndefendant, investigating the facts of the case, interviewing witnesses, securing \ndiscovery, engaging in motions practice, identifying and hiring experts when \nnecessary, and subjecting the evidence to adversarial testing.  As the Supreme \nCourt of Louisiana stated, “[w]e know from experience that no attorney can \nprepare for one felony trial per day, especially if he has little or no investigative, \nparalegal, or clerical assistance.”  State v. Peart, 621 So. 2d 780, 789 (La. 1993). \nD.  Civil Constructive-Denial-Of-Counsel Claims Provide An Important Tool \nFor Remedying Systemic Violations Of The Constitutional Right To Counsel \n \nA pre-conviction, civil constructive-denial-of-counsel claim is an effective \nway for indigent defendants to seek to effectuate the promise of Gideon.  \nIndividual post-conviction claims cannot provide systemic structural relief that will \nhelp fix the problem of under-funded and under-resourced public defenders.  \n- 28 - \n\n     \nIneffective-assistance-of-counsel claims under Strickland are, by definition, \nbackward-looking, limited to remedying injury caused by a single lawyer’s \nperformance in a single case.  “[C]ase-by-case requests for new counsel, appeals, \nand/or malpractice actions would not resolve the systemic problems identified by \nplaintiffs, making a request for injunctive and declaratory relief necessary.”  \nWilbur I, 2012 WL 600727, at *3. \nMoreover, because Strickland claims require a defendant to show a \n“reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of \nthe proceeding would have been different,” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, they \ncannot prevent harms flowing from denials of counsel that do not ultimately lead to \na conviction.  See Luckey, 860 F.2d at 1017 (observing that the Sixth Amendment \n“protects rights that do not affect the outcome of a trial,” and that prospective \nrelief, because it is “designed to avoid future harm,” can “protect constitutional \nrights, even if the violation of these rights would not affect the outcome of a trial”).  \nFor example, absence of counsel in the early critical stages of a criminal \nproceeding can result in unnecessary and prolonged pretrial detention.  Such \n- 29 - \n\n     \ndeprivations of liberty not only risk directly impacting the outcome of a person’s \ncriminal case,21 they can also have devastating collateral consequences.  \nUnnecessary or prolonged pretrial detention can lead to the defendant losing his \njob or housing, leaving the most vulnerable among us in struggling communities \ntrapped in a cycle of perpetual poverty and crisis.   \nThe civil constructive-denial-of-counsel claim recognized in Hurrell-\nHarring and Wilbur I provides indigent defendants deprived of their constitutional \nright to counsel with a meaningful tool for pursuing systemic relief.  The district \ncourt’s failure to recognize the availability of such claims, as distinct from post-\nconviction Strickland claims, erects a roadblock that will impede indigent \ndefendants’ ability to vindicate their Sixth Amendment right to counsel and breathe \nlife into the “noble ideal” that “every defendant stands equal before the law.”  \n                                           \n21  See Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 533 & n.35 (1972) (observing that “if \na defendant is locked up, he is hindered in his ability to gather evidence, contact \nwitnesses, or otherwise prepare his defense,” and citing “statistical evidence that \npersons who are detained between arrest and trial are more likely to receive prison \nsentences than those who obtain pretrial release”); U.S. SOI at 12-13, Varden v. \nCity of Clanton, No. 2:15-CV-34 (M.D. Ala. Feb. 13, 2015) (outlining ways \npretrial detention can affect outcomes, including by impeding the preparation of \nthe defense and increasing the likelihood that a defendant pleads guilty), available \nat http://www.justice.gov/file/340461/download. \n- 30 - \n\n     \nGideon, 372 U.S. at 344.  This Court should remove that roadblock and rule that \npre-conviction, civil constructive-denial-of-counsel claims seeking prospective \nrelief are actionable.    \n- 31 - \n\n     \nCONCLUSION \n   The judgment of the district court should be reversed. \n              Respectfully submitted, \n               \nWENDY J.

RICH, Clerk \nIN THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FOURTH JUDICIAL DISTRIC8)T1 S TEPoHt;ArvNrIvE  HARDY \nOF THE STATE OF IDAHO, IN AND FOR THE COUNTY OF ADA \nTRACY TUCKER, et al., \nPlaintiffs,  Case No. CV-OC-2015-10240 \nvs.  MEMORANDUM DECISION AND \nORDER GRANTING MOTION TO \nSTATE OF IDAHO, eta/.,  DISMISS \nDefendants. \nTHIS MATTER comes before the Court on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, filed July 8, 2015. \nA hearing was held on December 10, 2015, wherein the Court took the matter under advisement. \nFor the reasons stated herein, Defendants' Motion is GRANTED. \nBACKGROUND \nThe central claim in this case is that the named Plaintiffs, and other indigent criminal defendants \nsimilarly situated in the State of Idaho, are continuously being deprived of their state and federal \nconstitutional rights to counsel and Due Process of law, by the named Defendants, who are the \nState of Idaho,  Governor C.L.  \"Butch\" Otter,  and  the  Idaho  Public  Defense  Commission. \nPlaintiffs seek class action certification1 and remedial measures by this Court. \n1 Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Class Certification on June 17, 2015, which the parties agreed need not be decided \nuntil Defendants' present Motion to Dismiss was resolved. \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss ~ I \n\nPlaintiffs' Complaint alleges that Tracy Tucker, Jason Sharp, Naomi Morley, and Jeremy Payne \n(collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") were arrested and prosecuted, respectively, in Bonner, Shoshone, Ada, \nand Payette Counties.  Plaintiffs were represented by public defenders in their individual cases. \nThey allege facts to support claims of ineffective assistance of counsel for lack of representation \nat initial appearances, and attorneys' failure to communicate with them at times, or to file certain \nmotions on their behalf, or to properly investigate their cases. \nPlaintiffs contend that their individual experiences are representative of \"thousands of indigent \ndefendants across the State, who have been denied their right to effective counse1.\"2  Plaintiffs \nfurther claim that the \"current, patchwork public-defense arrangement in Idaho remains riddled \nwith  constitutional  deficiencies  and  fails,  at  all  stages  of the  prosecution and  adjudication \nprocesses,  to  ensure  adequate  representation  for  indigent  defendants  in  both  criminal  and \njuvenile proceedings in Idaho.\"3 \nPlaintiffs claim that the defects in the public defender system can be summarized as follows: (I) \nlack of representation at initial appearances, (2) extended and unnecessary pretrial detention, (3) \nexcessive caseloads, (4) lack of sufficient investigation and expert analysis, (5) lack of sufficient \naccess to or communication with the public defenders assigned to their cases, (6) continued use \nof fixed-fee contracts by some Idaho counties, (7) lack of public defender independence, and (8) \nlack of sufficient training, oversight, supervision, and evaluation.4 \n2 Pis.' Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief (hereafter, \"Complaint\"), ,18. \n3/d. ~ 9. \n4 Id. m197·16l. \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss • 2 \n\nIn  Idaho, the legislature has delegated its constitutional duty to provide public defense to the \nindividual counties.  The counties must administer and fund the public defender services.  Idaho \nCode § 19~859 states \"[t]he board of county commissioners of each county shall provide for the \nrepresentation of indigent persons and other individuals who are entitled to be represented by an \nattorney at  public  expense.\"  Counties are responsible  for  maintaining an  office of public \ndefender, joining with another county (or counties) to provide a joint office of public defender, \ncontracting with an existing office of public defender, or contracting with a private defense \nattorney for public defender services.5  Counties are required to \"annually appropriate enough \nmoney to administer\" its public defender program. 6  Some would call this an unfunded mandate. \nThe  natural  result  is  forty-four  different  systems  with  different  standards  and  resources, \nmanaging thousands of cases with varying quality of services.  In 20 I 0, the National Legal Aid \nand Defender Association (\"NLADA\") issued a report after studying trial level indigent services \noffered in seven Idaho counties, which identified a number of specific areas of concem.7  The \nreport stated that \"[b ]y delegating to each county the responsibility to provide counsel at the trial \nlevel without any state funding or oversight, Idaho has sewn a patchwork quilt of underfunded, \ninconsistent systems that vary greatly in defining who qualifies for services and in the level of \ncompetency of the services rendered.''8 \n5I.C. § 19-859. \n6 I.C. § 19-862. \n7 \"These include the widespread use of fixed-fee contracts; extraordinarily high attorney caseloads and workloads; \nlack  of consistent,  effective,  and  confidential  communication  with  indigent  clients;  inadequate,  and  often \nnonexistent, investigation of cases; lack of structural safeguards to protect the independence of defenders; lack of \nadequate  representation  of children  in  juvenile  and  criminal  court;  lack  of sufficient  supervision;  lack  of \nperfonnance-based standards; Jack of ongoing training and professional development; and lack of any meaningful \nfunding from the State.\" Complaint, 1. \n8 Complaint, 36 (citing National Legal Aid and Defender Association, The Guarantee of Counsel: Advocacy & Due \nProcess in Idaho's Trial Courts: Evaluation ofTrial-Level Indigent Defense Systems in Idaho at 2 (2010)), \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss -3 \n\nAfter  the  NLADA  report,  the  legislature  created  the  Idaho  Public  Defense  Commission \n(\"PDC'').9  lt is  a self-governing  executive  agency  with  four  members  appointed  by  the \nGovernor,  two  from  the  legislature  and  one  from  the  Supreme  Court.  It is  tasked  with \npromulgating rules for training and education for defense attorneys and to create uniform data \nreporting requirements that include caseload, workload, and expenditures.10  The PDC is also \ncharged with making recommendations to the Idaho legislature by January 20th of each year \n(beginning January 20, 2015) regarding requirements for contracts between counties and private \nattorneys,  qualifications  and  experience  standards,  enforcement  mechanisms,  and  funding \nissues.11  The PDC failed to make any recommendations as of January 20, 2015.12 \nPlaintiffs argue the PDC is too little, too late, and then it did not even do what it was supposed to \ndo.  Pointing to  past  public pronouncements by both  the  Governor and  the  Chief Justice, \nPlaintiffs claim: \n\"Despite the State's acknowledgement that significant refonn is necessary in this \narena - by,  among  other  things,  the  creation  of various  virtually  powerless \ncommittees,  including  the  establishment  in  2010  of  a  public-defense \nsubcommittee of the Criminal Justice Commission, the establishment in 2013 of a \nspecial  committee of the  legislature  to  recommend  legislative reforms  to  the \npublic-defense system, and the 2014 statutory amendments and formation of the \nPDC -- the State has done little to meaningfully address the myriad problems \nplaguing Idaho's indigent-defense system.\"13 \nPlaintiffs emphasize that the State does not provide any funding or supervision to any of the \ncounties, the public defender commission failed to promulgate any rules as of January 20, 2015, \n9 I.C. § 19-849 \nto I.C. §§ 19-849, 19-850. \nII I.C. § 19-850. \n12 \nComplaint~ 49. \n13 Complaint , 45. \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss -4 \n\nand the State has failed to sufficiently address the many state and federal constitutional issues \nraised by the NLADA report.14 \nUnquestionably, the State is ultimately responsible for ensuring constitutionally-sound public \ndefense.  Each branch of government has its responsibility.  Each branch also has its limits, due \nto the separation of powers.  Plaintiffs allege the State has failed to provide a constitutionally-\nsound system of public defense, despite being on notice for over a decade of the deficiencies in \nthe public defender system, because it provides no training, supervision, oversight, statewide \nstandards, or funding.15 \nCOURSE OF PROCEEDINGS \nOn June 17, 2015, Plaintiffs filed this Class Action Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory \nRelief against the State of Idaho, Governor C.L. \"Butchn Otter, and seven members of the PDC \n(collectively, \"Defendants\").  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and  injunctive relief to remedy  the \nDefendants'  failure \"to provide effective legal representation to indigent criminal defendants \nacross the State of Idaho, in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution, of Article 1, Section 13, of the Idaho Constitution, and Idaho statutes and \nregulations.\"16 \nPlaintiffs allege the following claims for relief: ( 1) violation of the Sixth Amendment of the \nUnited States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (right to counsel), (2) violation of Article 1, \n14 !d. mi 4648, 52. \nIS /d. m! 162·169. \n16 Complaint~ 3. \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss • 5 \n\nSection  13  of the  Idaho  Constitution  (right  to  counsel),  (3)  violation  of the  Fourteenth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C.  § 1983 (Due Process), and  (4) \nviolation of Article 1, Section 13 (Due Process), by the Defendants' failure to ensure that all \nindigent criminal defendants receive meaningful and effective legal representation at all critical \nstages of their cases.17 \nThe relief requested by Plaintiff in this case includes, in relevant part, the following: \nA)  CertifY this case as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Idaho Rules of Civil \nProcedure; \nB)  Declare that the State of Idaho is obligated to provide constitutionally adequate \nrepresentation  to  indigent  criminal  defendants,  including  at  their  initial \nappearances; \nC)  Declare that the constitutional rights of Idaho's indigent criminal defendants are \nbeing violated by the State on an ongoing basis, and provide a deadline for the \nState to move this Court for approval of specific modifications to the structure \nand operation of the State's indigent-defense system; \nD)  Enjoin the State from continuing to violate the rights of indigent defendants by \nproviding constitutionally deficient representation; \nE)  Enter an injunction requiring the State to propose, for this Court's approval and \nmonitoring, a plan to develop and implement a statewide system of public defense \nthat is consistent with the U.S. Constitution and the Constitution and laws of the \nState ofldaho; \nF)  Enter an injunction that requires the State to propose, for this Court's approval \nand  monitoring,  uniform  workload,  performance,  and  training  standards  for \nattorneys representing indigent criminal defendants in the State of Idaho in order \nto ensure accountability and to monitor effectiveness; \nG)  Enter an  injunction  barring  the  use  of fixed-fee  contracts  in  the delivery of \nindigent-defense services in the State of Idaho; .... 18 \nOn July 8, 2015, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss along with a Memorandum in Support. \nOn November 23, 2015, Plaintiffs filed a Response to the Motion to  Dismiss, along with an \n17 !d. m1170-183. \n18 Complaint, p. 53. \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss -6 \n\nAffidavit of Ian Thompson and Second Affidavit of Richard Eppink.19  On December 4, 2015, \nDefendants filed  a Reply Memorandum in Support of the Motion to Dismiss, along with an \nObjection  and  Motion to  Strike.  Plaintiffs  filed  a Response  to  Defendants'  Objection  and \nMotion to Strike on December 9, 2015. \nDefendants assert that the Complaint should be dismissed because the named Defendants are not \nproper parties (i.e. the State of Idaho is not a \"person\" subject to suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983; \nGovernor Otter and members of the Public Defense Commission cannot be sued under § 1983 or \nfor  alleged  violations  of constitutional  rights  as  they  have  no  legal  authority  to  make  the \nsweeping changes to Idaho's public defense system; and the Complaint fails to state a claim for \nrelief because the Court lacks authority to enjoin the State and there is no justiciable controversy \nbetween the State and Plaintiffs). \nPlaintiffs assert that the named Defendants are the proper parties because (1) the State bears the \nultimate responsibility for ensuring that the constitutional rights of Idahoans are protected (the \nUnited  States  Supreme  Court  has  repeatedly  indicated  that  indigent  defense  is  the  State's \nresponsibility, the State has an affirmative duty to ensure Sixth Amendment compliance, the \nState's delegation of duties to the counties does not abdicate the State's responsibility); (2) the \nGovernor and the PDC members are proper defendants because they are the only State officials \nwho give effect to Idaho's statewide indigent defense system; (3) resolving systematic reform \nlitigation is a central responsibility of the judiciary; and (4) Plaintiffs' suit complies with Idaho \nRules of Civil Procedure 3(b) and 65(d). \n19 On November 24, 2015, Plaintiffs tiled an \"Errata\" regarding certain errors in their Response, along with a \nCorrected Response. \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss-7 \n\nLEGAL STANDARD \n\"A court may grant a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b){6) only \nwhen it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the claim \nwhich would entitle the plaintiff to relief.\"  Harper v.  Harper,  122 Idaho 535, 536, 835 P.2d \n1346,  1347 (Ct. App.  1992).  In ruling on a motion to dismiss, the issue \"is not whether the \nplaintiff will ultimately prevail, but whether the party is entitled to offer evidence to support the \nclaims.\"  Losser v.  Bradstreet, 145 Idaho 670, 673, 183 P.3d 758, 761  (2008).  \"A motion to \ndismiss must be resolved solely from the pleadings and all facts and inferences from the record \nare viewed in favor of the non-moving party.\"  Taylor v. McNichols, 149ldaho 826, 832-33, 243 \nP.3d 642, 648-49 (2010). \nTo state a claim for relief and  survive a Rule  12(b)(6) motion, the pleading \"does not need \ndetailed factual allegations,\" however, the \"[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right \nto relief above the speculative level.\"  Bell At/. Co1p. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 545, 127 S. Ct. \n1955,  1959 (2007).  Mere \"labels and conclusions\" or a \"formulaic recitation of a cause of \naction's elements will not do.\"  ld.  There must be \"enough facts to state a claim to relief that is \nplausible on its face.\"  ld. at 547, 127 S. Ct. at 1960.  Stated differently, \"[the] complaint must \ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its \nface.\"  Ashcroft v.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678,  129 S. Ct.  1937,  1949 (2009).  \"As a practical \nmatter, a dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is likely to be granted only in the unusual case in which \nthe  plaintiff includes  allegations  showing on  the  face  of the  complaint  that  there  is  some \ninsurmountable bar to relief.\" Ha1per, 122 Idaho at 536, 835 P.2d at 1347. \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss -8 \n\nANALYSIS \n(1) Defendants' Objection and Motion to Strike \nAlong with their Response to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiffs filed an Affidavit of Ian \nThomson and an Affidavit of Richard Eppink.  Defendants contend that the Affidavits should be \nstricken or disregarded, because this is purely a Rule 12(b}(6) Motion and the Court has no right \nto consider outside material. \nPlaintiffs contend that the evidence may properly be considered without converting the Motion \nto Dismiss into a Motion for Summary Judgment, because Defendants' Motion is real1y a Rule \n12(b)(l} Motion challenging the Court's subject matter jurisdiction. \nThe Court may consider outside evidence on a Rule  12(b}(6)  Motion  so  long as  the Court \nconverts  the  Motion  into  one  for  Summary Judgment.  However,  it  is  within  the  Court's \ndiscretion to exclude such evidence and treat the Motion as purely a Motion to Dismiss.  See \nOrthman v. Idaho Power Company, 126 Idaho 960, 895 P.2d 561 (1995). \nHere, the Motion to Dismiss asserts that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief \ncan be granted under federal law (42 U.S.C.  1983) and under state law (Idaho Rules of Civil \nProcedure 3(b} and 65(d), and the Idaho Constitution).  This Motion is subject to Rule 12(b)(6) \nand can be decided without considering outside evidence.  Therefore, in exercising the Court's \ndiscretion, Defendants' Motion to Strike is GRANTED and the Affidavits filed by Plaintiffs will \nnot be considered. \nMemomndum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss -9 \n\n(2) Defendants' Motion to Dismiss . \nPlaintiffs  have  alleged  that  indigent  criminal  defendants  in  Idaho  are  systematically being \ndeprived of their constitutional rights to counsel and Due Process of law, due to the Defendants' \nfailure to provide an adequate public defense system in the State of Idaho. \nDefendants  assert that the entire action should be dismissed because the State of ldaho, the \nGovernor and the PDC are entitled to governmental immunity, and the Court lacks authority and \njurisdiction to order relief. \nBefore addressing the competing arguments on the Motion to Dismiss, underlying constitutional \nprinciples must first be addressed. \nOne of the founding principles of our system ofj ustice is that .. [i]n all criminal prosecutions, the \naccused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\"  U.S. Const. \namend.  VI.  The  landmark  1963  case,  Gideon  v.  Wainwright,  made clear that  an  indigent \ncriminal defendant is entitled to be represented by counsel even though they Jack the financial \nmeans to hire one.  The Court reasoned that the state has the obligation to provide indigent \ndefendants with counsel: \n[R]eason and reflection require us to recognize that in our adversary system of \ncriminal justice, any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, \ncannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him. This seems to us \nto be an obvious truth. Governments, both state and federal, quite properly spend \nvast sums of money to establish machinery to try defendants accused of crime. \nLawyers to prosecute are everywhere deemed essential to  protect the public's \ninterest in an orderly society. Similarly, there are few defendants charged with \ncrime, few indeed, who fail to hire the best lawyers they can get to prepare and \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss • I0  \n\npresent their defenses. That govenunent hires lawyers to prosecute and defendants \nwho have the money hire lawyers to defend are the strongest indications of the \nwidespread belief that lawyers in criminal courts are necessities, not luxuries. The \nright of one charged with crime to counsel may not be deemed fundamental and \nessential to fair trials in some countries, but it is in ours. From the very beginning, \nour  state  and  national  constitutions  and  laws  have  laid  great  emphasis  on \nprocedural  and  substantive  safeguards  designed  to  assure  fair  trials  before \nimpartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before the law. This \nnoble ideal cannot be realized if the poor man charged with crime has to face his \naccusers without a lawyer to assist him. \nGideon v.  Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 344, 83 S. Ct. 792, 796-97 (1963).  The Sixth Amendment \nright to  counsel is app1icable to  the states under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment.  /d.  The Idaho Constitution also guarantees the right to counsel: \"[i]n all criminal \nprosecutions, the party accused shall have the right to ... appear and defend in person and with \ncounsel.\"  Idaho Const. art. I,§ 13. \nThe United States Supreme Court also held that the constitutional right to counsel includes the \nright to effective assistance of counsel.  Strickland v.  Waslzington, 466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S. Ct. \n2052, 2063 (1984).  \"The Sixth Amendment recognizes the right to the assistance of counsel \nbecause it envisions counsel's playing a role that is critical to the ability of the adversarial system \nto produce just results. An accused is entitled to be assisted by an attorney, whether retained or \nappointed, who plays the role necessary to ensure that the trial is fair.\"  Strickland, 466 U.S. at \n685, 10 4 S. Ct. at 2063.  As explained in United States v. Cronic: \nThe special value of the right to the assistance of counsel explains why \"[i]t has \nlong  been  recognized  that  the  right  to  counsel  is  the  right  to  the  effective \nassistance of counsel.\" The text of the Sixth Amendment itself suggests as much. \nThe Amendment requires not merely the provision of counsel to the accused, but \n\"Assistance,'' which is to be \"for his defence.\" Thus, \"the core purpose of the \ncounsel  guarantee  was  to  assure  'Assistance'  at trial,  when  the  accused  was \nconfronted with both the intricacies of the law and the advocacy of the public \nprosecutor.\" [f no actual \"Assistance\" \"for\" the accused's \"defence\" is provided, \nthen the constitutional guarantee has been violated. To  hold otherwise \"could \nconvert the appointment of counsel into a sham and nothing more than a formal \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss -11 \n\ncompliance with  the Constitution's requirement that  an  accused be  given  the \nassistance  of counsel.  The  Constitution's  guarantee  of assistance  of counsel \ncannot be satisfied by mere formal appointment.\" \nThe  substance  of the  Constitution's  guarantee  of the  effective  assistance  of \ncounsel  is  Hluminated by reference to  its underlying purpose. \"[T]ruth,\" Lord \nEldon  said, \"is best discovered  by powerful  statements on  both  sides  of the \nquestion.\" This dictum describes the unique strength of our system of criminal \njustice. \"The very premise of our adversary system of criminal justice is that \npartisan advocacy on both sides of a case will best promote the ultimate objective \nthat the guilty be convicted and the innocent go free.\" It is that \"very premise\" \nthat underlies and gives meaning to the Sixth Amendment. It '\"is meant to assure \nfairness  in  the  adversary  criminal  process.\"  Unless  the  accused  receives  the \neffective assistance of counsel, \"a serious risk of injustice infects the trial itself.\" \nUnited States v.  Cronic, 466 U.S.  648,  654~56, 104 S.  Ct.  2039,  204~45 (1984) (footnotes \nomitted, citations omitted). \n\"The Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right to counsel during all 'critical \nstages' of the adversarial proceedings against him.\"  Estrada v. State, 143 Idaho 558, 562, 149 \nP.3d 833, 837 (2006); United States v.  Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 224, 87 S. Ct. 1926, 1931 (1967). \n\"The commencement of the criminal prosecution, whether by way of fonnal charge, preJiminary \nhearing, indictment, information, or arraignment, marks the 'critical stage' of the prosecution to \nwhich the guarantees of the Sixth Amendment are applicable.\"  State v. Sire/ton, 129 Idaho 877, \n880-81, 934 P.2d 943, 946-47 (Ct. App. 1997) ...T hus, under criminal procedures followed in \nIdaho, a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel is triggered by the filing of a criminal \ncomplaint or an indictment.\"  State v.  Tapp,  136 Idaho 354, 363, 33 P.3d 828, 837 (Ct. App. \n2001).  A critical stage of the proceedings is any stage ''where certain rights may be sacrificed or \nlost.\"  Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 7, 90 S. Ct. 1999, 2002 (1970).  Critical stages include, \nfor example, the preliminary hearing, Coleman, 399 U.S. at 9, 90 S. Ct. at 2003, the pretrial \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss- 12 \n\nlineup, id., the arraignment, Murillo v. State, 144 Idaho 449, 454, 163 P.3d 238, 243 (Ct. App. \n2007); Bell v.  Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 696, 122 S. Ct. 1843, 1851 (2002), and the entry of a plea, \nState v. Creech, 10 9 Idaho 592, 602, 71 0 P. 2d 502, 512 ( 1985). \nAs explained by the United States Supreme Court in Maine v. Moulton: \n[T]be Court bas also recognized that the assistance of counsel cannot be limited to \nparticipation in a trial; to deprive a person of counsel during the period prior to \ntrial  may  be  more  damaging  than  denial  of counsel  during  the  trial  itself. \nRecognizing that the right to the assistance of counsel is shaped by the need for \nthe  assistance  of counsel,  we  have  found  that  the  right  attaches  at  earlier, \n\"critical\" stages in the criminal justice process \"where the results might well settle \nthe  accused's  fate  and  reduce  the  trial  itself to  a  mere  fonnality.\"  And, \n\"[w]hatever else it may mean,  the  right to  counsel  granted by the Sixth and \nFourteenth Amendments means at least that a person is entitled to the help of a \nlawyer at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated against \nhim ....\"  This is because, after the initiation of adversary criminal proceedings, \n\"'the government has committed itself to prosecute, and ... the adverse positions \nof government and defendant have solidified. It is then that a defendant finds \nhimself faced with the prosecutorial forces of organized society, and immersed in \nthe intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law.'\" \nMaine v. Moulton, 474 U.S. 159, 170, 106 S. Ct. 477, 484, 88 L. Ed. 2d 481  (1985) (citations \nomitted). \nIt is abundantly clear in the authorities cited above that the fundamental right to counsel, and the \nright to ejfoctive assistance of counsel, is critical not only at a defendant's trial, but also in the \npretrial proceedings. \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss~ 13 \n\nA.  GOVERNMENTAL IMMUNITY UNDER§ 1983 \nDefendants argue that they are not the proper parties to be sued in this suit, because they are not \n\"persons\" subject to suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and they cannot provide redress for the claims \nmade by Plaintiffs.  Defendants argue that there is no authority requiring a state or one of its \nofficers \"to be responsible for ensuring that there are constitutionally adequate public defender \nservices throughout the State.\"20  Defendants also contend they are not proper parties because \nIdaho statutes place responsibility for the public defender system on county officials, not on the \nGovernor or the PDC. \nPlaintiffs have conceded in their Response brief1 and at oral argument that the State of Idaho is \nnot a \"person\" for purposes ofinjunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Plaintiffs conceded that \nthe federal law claims against the State should be dismissed.22  Therefore, Counts 1 and 3 must \nbe dismissed against the State of Idaho.  Accordingly, the Court will address only whether the \nGovernor and the PDC members are \"persons\" subject to suit under§ 1983. \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 is a remedial statute which provides an avenue of redress to persons injured by \nthe actions of government which violated federal constitutional rights.  The statue provides in \npertinent part: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or \nusage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to \nbe  subjected,  any  citizen  of the  United  States  or  other  person  within  the \njurisdiction thereof to  the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities \nsecured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an \n20 Defs.'

Michigan Department of State Police, the United States Supreme Court specifically \naddressed the issue of whether a State, or an official acting in his or her official capacity, is a \nperson within the meaning of§ 1983.  The Court held that \"States or governmental entities that \nare considered 'arms of the State' for Eleventh Amendment purposes\" are not 'persons' under§ \n1983.\"  Will v. Michigan Dep't ofS tate Police, 491  U.S. 58, 70, 109 S. Ct. 2304, 2312 (1989). \nWill also held that state officials acting in their official capacities are not \"persons\" within the \nmeaningof§ 1983.  Wi//,491 U.S.at71, 109S.Ct.at2312. \nHowever, there is an exception that \"[w]hen sued for prospective injunctive relief, a state official \nin his official capacity is considered a \"person\" for § 1983 purposes.  In what has become known \nas part of the Ex parte Young doctrine, a suit for prospective injunctive relief provides a narrow, \nbut well-established, exception to  Eleventh Amendment  immunity.\"  Doe,  131  F.3d  at  839 \n(emphasis in original, citation omitted).  \"The rule of Ex parte Young gives life to the Supremacy \nClause by providing a pathway to relief from continuing violations of federal law by a state or its \nofficers.\" Los Angeles Cty. Bar Ass 'n, 979 F.2d at 704. \nUnder Ex parte Young, the state officer sued must have some connection with the enforcement of \nthe allegedly unconstitutional act.  Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 157,28 S. Ct. 441,453 (1908). \n\"That  connection  must be  fairly  direct;  a generalized duty to  enforce state  law  or general \n23 Claims under § 1983 are limited by the scope of the Eleventh Amendment, Doe v.

Harris, 729 \nF.3d 937, 943 (9th Cir. 2013) (citations omitted). \nDefendants claim the Governor and PDC only have a ''generalized duty\" to supervise or enforce \na  constitutionally  sound  public  defense  system,  but  no  direct  or  specific  authority  or \nresponsibility.  Defendants emphasize that the legislature has delegated that duty to the counties, \nas well as the duty to collect taxes in support thereof.  Defendants assert that the Governor and \nthe PDC members \"do not directly control, regulate, administer, or otherwise bear responsibility \nfor provision of public defender services, and they have no ability to  provide the requested \nrelief. \"24 \nDefendants point to Association des Eleveurs de Canards et d 'Oies du Quebec, a case where \nproducers and sellers of foie gras brought an action against the State of California, the governor, \nand the attorney general, to enjoin the enforcement of a statute that \"bans the sale of products \nthat are the result of force feeding birds to enlarge their livers beyond normal size.\"  Ass 'n des \nEleveurs de Canards et d'Oies du Quebec, 729 F.3d at 942.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \nfound that the California Governor was entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity because his \nonly connection to the statute was a general duty to enforce state law.  /d. at 943.  However, the \nattorney  general  was  not  entitled  to  immunity,  because  the  statute  specifically  authorized \nenforcement by district and city attorneys and the attorney general has direct supervision and the \nsame powers as district attorneys.  /d. \n24 Defs. • Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, p. 11. \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss -16 \n\nPlaintiffs assert that the Governor and the PDC members have a sufficient connection to public \ndefense in Idaho.  Plaintiffs further contend that the Governor is responsible for indigent defense \nand has power to effectuate necessary changes to improve the public defense system.  Plaintiffs \nassert the Governor appoints the majority of the PDC members, is deeply and directly involved \nin its work, and has been in regular communication with the PDC on systemic public defense \nissues.  Plaintiffs argue that the Governor has legal appointment authority over the PDC, the \nState Appellate Public Defender, and boards of county commissioners as well.25  The PDC has \nstatutory duties to establish rules governing public defenders throughout the State, I.C. § 19-\n850(1 )(a),  and  is  mandated  to  make  recommendations  for  system-wide  refonn,  I. C.  §  19-\n850(1 )(b). 26 \nPlaintiffs cite Los Angeles County Bar Association, where the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \nfound  that  the  governor was  not entitled to  Eleventh Amendment immunity where  the  bar \nassociation was challenging the constitutionality of a statute that prescribed the number ofj udges \non the Superior Court of Los Angeles County.  Los Angeles Cty. Bar Ass 'n, 979 F .2d at 704. \nThere, the Court found that the governor had a specific connection to the challenged statute, \nbecause the governor had the duty to appoint judges to any new positions.  /d. \nDefendants urge the Court to find that the Governor and the PDC have no responsibility for \npublic defense  in  Idaho.  The Court disagrees.  Contrary to the alleged animal  abuse issue \npresented in Association des Eleveurs de Canards et d 'Oies du Quebec, the central issue in this \ncase concerns  the continuous and  systematic  violation  of fundamental  constitutional human \n25 Pis.' Response to Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss, p. II. \n26/d. \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss -17 \n\nrights.  Plaintiffs pose serious allegations of widespread systemic violations of constitutional \nrights to counsel, to effective assistance of counsel, and to fair judicial proceedings for indigent \ncriminal defendants across the State of Idaho. \nThe Defendants would have the Court believe that the plain language set forth in United States \nSupreme Court cases mandating that it is the State's responsibility to provide counsel to indigent \ncriminal defendants does not in fact place any responsibility on the Defendants in this case. \nUnder the Ex parte Young doctrine, the Court finds that the Governor and the PDC members \nhave a more than sufficiently close connection or nexus to the enforcement of public defense in \nIdaho.  The Governor has a duty to ensure that the Constitution and laws are enforced in Idaho. \nThe Governor also has direct supervisory authority over those responsible to establish standards \nfor a constitutionally sound public defense system.  The PDC was specifically saddled with the \nresponsibility of creating rules regarding training and education of defense attorneys and making \nrecommendations to the legislature for improving public defense in Idaho.  The fact that the \nlegislature has delegated public defender services to individual counties does not abdicate the \nDefendants' responsibility to indigent criminal defendants in the State ofldaho.  (Neither does it \nabdicate further legislative responsibility, nor excuse legislative inaction.) \nAccordingly, the Court finds that the Governor and the PDC members are subject to suit under \nu.s.c. \n42  § 1983. \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss • 18 \n\nB.  JUSTICIABLE CONTROVERSY \nIn this case, Plaintiffs seek various forms of declaratory and injunctive relief.  \"A prerequisite to \na declaratory judgment action is an actual or justiciable controversy.\" Miles v.

The elements of a justiciable controversy include \nthe following: \nA \"controversy\"  in  this  sense  must  be  one  that  is  appropriate  for  judicial \ndetermination. A justiciable controversy is thus distinguished from a difference or \ndispute of a hypothetical or abstract character; from one that is academic or moot. \nThe controversy must be definite and concrete, touching the legal relations of the \nparties having adverse legal interests. It must be a real and substantial controversy \nadmitting  of specific  relief through  a decree  of a conclusive  character,  as \ndistinguished  from  an  opinion  advising  what  the  law  would  be  upon  a \nhypothetical· state of facts. \nWylie v.

Bd., 151 Idaho 26, 31,253 P.3d 700,705 (2011) (citation omitted). \n\"Justiciability is generally divided into subcategories-advisory opinions, feigned and coJlusive \ncases, standing, ripeness, mootness, political questions, and administrative questions.\"  Miles, \n116 Idaho at 639, 778 P.2d at 761. \nIn this case, the issues of standing, ripeness, and separation of powers are implicated. 27  Each \nissue will be discussed in tum. \n27 In Miles v. Idaho Power Company, the Court discussed separation of powers as nn element of justiciability. \nMiles, 116 Idaho at 639,778 P.2d at 761 (1989). Accordingly, separation of powers will be addressed as a sub-issue \nof the justiciability doctrine. \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss • 19 \n\n1)  Standing \nPlaintiffs must first establish standing to bring a case.  \"The doctrine of standing focuses on the \nparty seeking relief and not on the issues the party wishes to have adjudicated.\"  Miles,  116 \nIdaho at 641, 778 P. 2d at 763.  The major aspect of the standing inquiry has been explained as \nfollows: \nThe essence of the standing inquiry is whether the parties seeking to invoke the \ncourt's jurisdiction have \"alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the \ncontroversy  as  to  assure  that  concrete  adverseness  which  sharpens  the \npresentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of \ndifficult constitutional questions.\" As refined by subsequent reformulation, this \nrequirement of a \"personal stake\" has come to be understood to require not only a \n\"distinct and palpable injury,\" to the plaintiff, but also a \"fairly traceable\" causal \nconnection between the claimed injury and the challenged conduct. \nDuke Power Co.  v.  Carolina Envtl.  Study Grp.,  Inc., 438 U.S.  59, 72, 98 S. Ct. 2620, 2630 \n(1978) (citations omitted).  Thus, in order to have standing to bring suit, a plaintiff must have (1) \nsuffered an injury in fact, (2) causally connected to the conduct complained of, and (3) it is likely \nas opposed to merely speculative that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.  See \nLujan v. Deft. ofWi/dlife, 504 U.S. 555,560-61, 112 S. Ct. 2130,2136 (1992). \n\"[T]o satisfy the case or controversy requirement of standing, litigants generally must allege or \ndemonstrate an injury in fact and a substantial likelihood that the judicial relief requested will \nprevent or redress the claimed injury.\" Miles, 116 Idaho at 641, 778 P.2d at 763.  ''In some cases \neven though a plaintiff has shown or alleged an 'injury in fact,' standing is denied because of \nother factors.  For example, the United States Supreme Court has held that 'when the asserted \nhann is a 'generalized grievance' shared in substantially equal measure by all or a large class of \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss -20 \n\ncitizenst that hann alone nonnally does not warrant exercise of jurisdiction.\"'  Id.  (citation \nomitted). \n\"At the pleading  stage,  general  factual  allegations of injury resulting  from  the defendant's \nconduct may suffice, for on a motion to dismiss we 'presum[e] that general allegations embrace \nthose specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.\"'  Ltyan, 504 U.S. at 561, 112 S. Ct. \nat 2137 (citation omitted). \na.  Injury in Fact \nThis is an issue of first impression in Idaho, as neither the United States Supreme Court nor the \nIdaho  Supreme Court has addressed a Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of \ncounsel  claim  for  declaratory  and  prospective  injunctive  relief concerning  claimed  pre \nconviction systemic injuries resulting from the representation that indigent criminal defendants \nare receiving from their publically appointed attorneys. \nIn  this case, Plaintiffs' alleged injury is the violation of their right to effective assistance of \ncounsel.  As alleged, the injury is specialized and peculiar to each of the named Plaintiffs. \nHowever, Plaintiffs also allege that all indigent criminal defendants are suffering alike from the \ncurrent public defender system in Idaho. \nHere, it is important to note the procedural posture of the Plaintiffs' underlying criminal lawsuits \nin this matter.  As of the date the lawsuit was filed, none of the Plaintiffs were convicted or \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss -21 \n\nsentenced in any of their pending criminal cases.  On the record presented, it is troubling to the \nCourt that the Plaintiffs have not yet been convicted of any crime in their underlying cases, nor \npursued or exhausted any appeal rights, nor any post-conviction relief.  Accordingly, the Court \nfails to see how the Plaintiffs have suffered an injury at the time the Complaint was filed in this \nmatter.  At this point, Plaintiffs have alleged various fonns of ineffective assistance of counsel; \nhowever, there is not yet any ascertainable injury - i.e. none of the Plaintiffs have either been \nconvicted or sentenced.  Accordingly, the Court finds the Plaintiffs have not properly alleged an \nactual injury. \nb.  Causal Connection \nThe second element of standing requires the Plaintiffs to properly allege that the injury suffered \nis causally connected to the conduct complained of.  In other words, the injury must be \"fairly \ntraceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the independent action \nof some third party not before the court!' Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560, 112 S. Ct. at 2136. \nPlaintiffs allege that the State, the Governor, and the PDC are ultimately on the hook for public \ndefender services in Idaho.  However, the legislature has currently delegated the responsibility \nfor public defender services to individual counties, none of which are parties to this suit.  The \nComplaint alleges,  and  it  is commonly accepted  in  official  pronouncements  by  the highest \nofficials in all three branches of government that there are widespread systemic problems with \nthe public defense system.  Defendants concede this point.  However, it is not clear (or even \nproperly alleged) that systemic constitutional violations are occurring in ~ county.  Plaintiffs \nMemomndum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss· 22 \n\nallege there is a problem with public defense in the entire State of Idaho, but only provides \nexamples from a sampling of counties that are not even party to this lawsuit. \nPlaintiffs challenge the inaction of the Defendants, but do not acknowledge the legislature and \nthe county commissioners - the principal bodies with the power to affect the policy (political) \nand systemic changes Plaintiffs seek.  The connection of the claimed injury to the Governor and \nthe PDC are too remote to be fairly traceable.  Neither has the power and authority to act alone to \nredress Plaintiffs' grievances.  Certainly, both have moral, political, and public power to pressure \nthe legislature or the counties to act, but neither have the ability to require it.  Accordingly, there \nis no fairly traceable causal connection between the claimed injury and the challenged inaction. \nc.  Redressability \nFinally, Plaintiffs must show that it is likely as opposed to merely speculative that the injury will \nbe redressed by a favorable decision.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561, 112 S. Ct. at 2136.  In order to \nhave  standing,  the  Court must  be able to  redress  the  problems not  merely  in  an  advisory, \nhypothetical or speculative way, but concretely. \nHere, Plaintiffs seek relief in their individual cases as well as in all other indigent criminal cases \nin Idaho.  However, there is no basis for the Court to award such relief where the Plaintiffs \nthemselves have not even been convicted of a crime, nor appealed, nor sought post-conviction or \nother relief. \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss -23 \n\nInstead, Plaintiffs invite the Court to make a variety of largely speculative assumptions:  (1) that \nthe Plaintiffs (and the class members they would represent) will in fact be convicted of a crime, \n(2) that the actions or inactions of the Defendants will have caused those convictions (i.e. that the \nactions or inactions of Defendants will have been so prejudicial that the Plaintiffs will have been \ndenied their constitutional right to a fair trial), (3) that the trial courts in each case will be unable \nor unwilling to correct such results (e.g., new trial, dismissal, etc.), (4) that the Plaintiffs will be \ngranted the relief they seek in this case, and that any such remedy would or could truly redress \nthe problem. \nThe issue of ineffective assistance of counsel is frequently raised in petitions for post-conviction \nrelief and addressed on a case-by-case basis.  In every case, before or after exhausting appeal \nrights, every convicted criminal defendWlt has the right to seek judicial review of the public \ndefense services provided.  The topic has been addressed by the United States Supreme Court \nWld by the Idaho Supreme Court on a number of occasions. \nIn  Strickland v.  Washington,  the United States Supreme Court laid  down a two-part test to \nanalyze claims alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.  Under this test, the petitioner must \ndemonstrate  (l) that  counsel's  performance  was  deficient  Wld  (2)  that  the  petitioner  was \nprejudiced by the deficiency.  Strickland v.  Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88, I 04 S.Ct. 2052, \n2064-65 (1984).  To establish deficient performance, the applicant must prove that counsel's \nrepresentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.  !d. \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss -24 \n\nIn a post-conviction setting, a criminal defendant has the right to challenge the adequacy of his \nor her representation, and those cases are decided on a case-by-case basis, with the Court finding \nthe individual facts of the case based on evidence and testimony, then applying the law to the \nfacts, which is the traditional exercise of judicial authority. 28  Strickland requires proof of actual \nprejudice, and here, there is no showing that any prejudice has been suffered in the Plaintiffs' \nunderlying criminal cases.  Rather, the prejudice suffered by Plaintiffs is merely hypothetical at \nthis point.  Moreover, even if prejudice were actually shown, any relief by this Court would be \nadvisory or hypothetical since the underlying criminal cases are not before this Court. \nPlaintiffs do not contend that the post-conviction procedure is faulty or is systematically failing \ncriminal  defendants  in  fdaho.  Instead,  Plaintiffs  ask  this  Court  to  basicaJly intervene  and \nsupersede in every single case, and  in  every court and county and  to  then make  a blanket \ndetennination that every indigent criminal defendant's rights are being violated.  This is a giant \nstep  from  the  case-by-case analysis  of ineffective  assistance  of counsel  claims.  Plaintiffs \ngeneraJly request sweeping relief for counties and cases where there might not be any deficiency \nin public defense services. \nWithout a doubt, the Court believes that there are serious problems with public defense in Idaho \nthat need to be addressed.  However, this Court cannot and should not usurp the duties of the \nPDC.  Essentially, the Plaintiffs request the Court to assume control of public defense in Idaho, \non the basis that a few defendants might have their rights violated.  Such relief is too speculative \nand fundamentally violates the notion that courts are to decide specific cases and controversies \nbefore them.  Accordingly, the Court finds Plaintiffs lack standing. \n28 Extended even further, there is also the Writ of Habeas Corpus remedy available. \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss -25 \n\n2)  Ripeness \nAnother subcategory of justiciability is ripeness, which \"asks whether there is any need for court \naction at the present time.\"  Miles, 116 Idaho at 642, 778 P.2d at 764.  A case is not justiciable if \nit  is  not ripe.  Noh  v.  Cenarrusa,  137 Idaho  798,  801,  53 P.3d  1217,  1220 (2002).  \"The \ntraditional ripeness doctrine requires a petitioner or plaintiff to prove 1) that the case presents \ndefinite and concrete issues, 2) that a real and substantial controversy exists, and 3) that there is a \npresent need for adjudication.\" Noh, 137 Idaho at 801, 53 P.3d at 1220.  A declaratory judgment \naction must raise issues that are definite and concrete, and must involve a real and substantial \ncontroversy as opposed to an advisory opinion based upon hypothetical facts.  Harris v.  Cassia \nCounty, 106 Idaho 513,516,681 P.2d 988,991 (1984).  The purpose of the ripeness requirement \nis to prevent courts from entangling themselves in purely abstract disagreements. Abbot Labs. v. \nGardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148,87 S.Ct. 1507, 1515 (1967). \nIn this case, even with the facts in the Complaint construed as true, Plaintiffs have not made \nsufficient allegations  to  sustain a Motion to  Dismiss on the first  two elements of ripeness, \nnamely, that there are definite, concrete issues and a real, substantial controversy exists.  The \nComplaint invites the Court to make speculative assumptions regarding Plaintiffs' conclusions. \nFor example, although an arraignment is a critical proceeding requiring counsel,  there is  no \nallegation (and the Court would find it hard to believe) that every single indigent defendant is \nlacking counsel in every single county and at every single arraignment.  As set forth above, \nPlaintiffs have not even pursued any appeal or post-conviction relief in their individual cases. \nWhile it seems Plaintiffs make allegations of present violations of right to counsel, the ultimate \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss • 26 \n\nresults in their cases have not yet been determined.  Our appeals process determines whether a \ndefendant received due process on a case-by-case basis.  At this time, Plaintiffs' arguments are \nbased on assumptions that they will be convicted and that their convictions will be due to their \nsystemic public defense inadequacies. \nThis case is ultimately not ripe for adjudication.  As previously set forth, none of the Plaintiffs' \ncriminal cases have concluded, no appeals have taken place, and no post-conviction relief has \nbeen sought.  In each of their individual cases, Plaintiffs can assert and litigate the claim of lack \nof effective assistance of counsel and lack of a fair trial.  If it is decided that their constitutional \nrights have been violated, then those courts can order a specific remedy, for example, a new trial \nor dismissal of the case.  Thus, the nature and extent of any real or permanent injury cannot be \ndetermined at this time.  Accordingly, the Court finds the case is not ripe for adjudication. \n3)  Separation of Powers19 \nAs much as anything, this case involves the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers.  The \ndoctrine permeated the discussion above, and will be discussed further below. \nDefendants contend that only the legislature can make the changes requested by Plaintiffs, and \nthe legislature would not be bound by any injunction entered by the district court in this case. \n29 Defendants originally contended in their Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss that although the case \npresented a serious separation of powers issue, the issue need not be addressed because under Idaho Rules of Civil \nProcedure 3(b) and 65(d) the Court does not have authority to issue an injunction in this case.  However, in their \nReply Memorandum and at the hearing held on December 16, 2015, Defendants did not argue for dismissal on the \nbasis of the Idaho Rules of Civil Procedure, but on the separation of powers doctrine.  The Court does not find \nDefendants' argument for dismissal on the basis of the Rules 3(b) and 65(d) persuasive. \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss -27 \n\nDefendants further assert that neither the Governor nor the PDC members have statutory or \nconstitutional authority to tell county officers how to operate the public defense system. \nArticle 2, § 1 of the Idaho Constitution provides for the separation of powers among the three \nbranches of Idaho's government.  Article 3, § 1 provides that the power to pass bills is vested in \nthe legislature.  Article 3, § 15, provides that \"[n]o law shall be passed except by bill[.]\"  \"Read \ntogether, these three constitutional provisions stand for the proposition that, of Idaho's three \nbranches of government, only the legislature has the power to make 'law.\"' Mead v. Arnell, 117 \nIdaho 660, 664, 791 P.2d 410,414 (1990). \nThe  separation  of powers  doctrine  asks  \"whether this  Court,  by  entertaining  review  of a \nparticular matter, would be substituting its judgment for that of another coordinate branch of \ngovernment, when the matter was one properly entrusted to that other branch.\"  Miles, 116 Idaho \nat 639, 778 P.2d at 761. \nIn Idaho Schools for Equal Opportu11ity v. State, 123 Idaho 573, 850 P.2d 724 (1993) (ISEEO 1), \nthe Supreme Court determined that the plaintiffs had standing to sue the defendants (including \nthe State and the Governor) and it also rejected the State's argument that the court was invading \nthe legislature's authority by declaring that the present level and method of funding for Idaho's \npublic schools is unconstitutional.  The Supreme Court stated: \n[W]e  decline to  accept  the  respondents'  argument  that  the other branches of \ngovernment be allowed  to  interpret the constitution for  us. That would be an \nabject abdication of our role in the American system of government. \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss • 28 \n\nPassing on  the  constitutionality of statutory enactments,  even enactment with \npolitical overtones, is a fundamental responsibility of the judiciary, and has been \nso since Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (I Cranch) 137,2 L.Ed. 60 (1813). \n!d. at 583, 850 P.2d at 734.  There is no question that the judiciary has the power to \"say what \nthe law is.\"  Marbwy v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 177, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803) (\"It is emphatically the \nprovince and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\").  Accordingly, a court is \n\"not  precluded  from  reviewing  the  constitutionality of a proposed  course of action  merely \nbecause both the executive and legislative branches happen to concur in supporting it.\"  Miles, \n116 Idaho  at 640,  778  P.2d at 762.  \"Constitutional rights, as  well  as  this Court's duty to \nfaithfully interpret our constitution and the federal constitution, do not wane before united efforts \nof the legislature and the governor.\" !d. \nHere,  the Idaho legislature has delegated the duty to provide indigent criminal defense to the \ncounties.  See I.C. § 19-859.  Plaintiffs ask the Court to override this system and reshape the \nsystem of indigent criminal defense in Idaho.  The Court finds that it would invade the province \nof the legislature to do so. \nPlaintiffs  do  not  argue  that  the  statute  delegating  the  duty  to  provide  public  defense  is \nunconstitutional.  They simply argue  that  the county commissioners  in  some or all  of the \ncounties, and the various systems of public defense, have failed to protect their constitutional \nrights to counsel and a fair trial.  Instead of filing suit against those counties where they believe \ntheir constitutional rights  have been violated,  they brought this action against the State, the \nGovernor, and the PDC.  Plaintiffs also do not argue that the statute establishing the PDC is \nunconstitutional.  They argue, instead, that the PDC is an ineffective and inadequate response by \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss -29 \n\nthe legislature to redress the problem of inadequate or ineffective assistance of public defense \ncounsel.  Instead of seeking to have an act declared unconstitutional, they ask this Court to \ndeclare the inaction to be unconstitutional.  Plaintiffs ask this Court to declare the whole system \n(or lack of system) to be unconstitutional and to then establish standards or guidelines, based on \nprevious holdings of other courts, that the Governor, the PDC, the legislature, and all counties \n(whom they have not sued at this time), must follow.  Plaintiffs ask this Court to mandate that the \nGovernor and the PDC (and the legislature and counties) must enact as legislation, ordinances, or \nrules to meet those standards, and to provide adequate funding therefore.  This Court does not \nhave the power or jurisdiction to do so under the established principles of separation of powers \nimbedded in the federal and state constitutions. \nTo be sure, the Governor, as the \"supreme executive power of the state\" has the duty to ensure \nthat the constitution and laws are enforced.  Idaho Const. art. N, § 5.  The Governor also has the \nability to make recommendations to the legislature concerning the public defense system in \nIdaho.  In addition, the Governor can veto budgets that do not appropriate any funding toward \nimproving the public defender system in Idaho.  Thus, even without the \"power of the purse\" or \nthe power to legislate, the Governor has a constitutional duty to ensure a constitutionally sound \npublic defense system, to the maximum extent of his authority within the limitations of power of \nthe office.  Moreover, the PDC has direct statutory duties and responsibilities, some of which \nwere not met more than a year ago. \nUnder the Jong~held principles of Marbury v. Madison, this Court has jurisdiction to pass on the \nconstitutionality of statutory enactments, even enactments with political overtones.  This is a \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss -30 \n\nfundamental responsibility of the judiciary.  However, it is not the role of courts, but that of the \npolitical branches, to shape the institutions of government in such fashion as to comply with the \nlaws and the Constitution.  Accordingly, the Court finds  the case violates the separation of \npowers doctrine. \nThis case presents troubling allegations regarding problems with the public defender system in \nIdaho.  The Court is sympathetic with Plaintiffs' plight.  However, the case invites the Court to \nmake speculative assumptions regarding the outcomes of individual cases (that are before other \ncourts and in other counties), presume that all indigent criminal defendants in all counties are \nreceiving the same ineffective assistance of counsel, and then issue blanket orders halting all \ncriminal prosecutions until the issues are resolved.  The Court declines to do so as such action \nwould essentially mandate the Court legislating standards that must be met in every county and \nin  every  case.  Courts  can,  and  do,  find,  and  redress  violations  of constitutional  rights  in \nindividual cases.  But, it is not the proper role of the Court to legislate specific standards, nor can \nthe Court provide funding to enact those standards.  Accordingly, the Court finds that this case is \nnot a proper case or controversy for judicial action. \nCONCLUSION \nFor alJ the reasons set forth herein, Defendants' Motion to Dismis \nMemorandum Decision and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss -31 \n\nCERTIFICATE OF MAILING \n11 \nI hereby certify that on this  day of January, 2016, I mailed (served) a true and correct copy \nof the within instrument to: \nRichard Eppink \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union of Idaho  Steven L.

More than five years ago, the State of Idaho asked the National Legal Aid and Defender \nAssociation (\"NLADA\") for a repmt on its public-defense system.  That report found, \nunequivocally, that \"none of the public defender systems in the sample counties are \nconstitutionally adequate.\"  Specifically, the report identified a number of specific areas of \nconcern with respect to trial-level indigent-defense delivery in Idaho.  These include the \nwidespread use of fixed-fee contracts; extraordinarily high attorney caseloads and workloads; \nlack of consistent, effective, and confidential communication with indigent clients; inadequate, \nand often nonexistent, investigation of cases; lack of structural safeguards to protect the \nindependence of defenders; lack of adequate representation of children in juvenile and criminal \ncomt; lack of sufficient supervision; lack of performance-based standards; lack of ongoing \ntraining and professional development; and lack of any meaningful funding from the State. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-2 \n\n2.  Five years later, the State has failed to fix this unconstitutional system.  The Governor's \nCommission passed the buck by recommending that the Legislature create a special study \ncommittee.  That legislative committee then passed the buck by establishing yet another \ncommission to make recommendations to the legislature.  In January 2015, the Governor \nacknowledged in his State of the State address that \"the courts have made it clear that our current \nmethod of providing legal counsel for indigent criminal defendants does not pass constitutional \nmuster.\"  Astoundingly, the State failed yet again in the recently concluded 2015 legislative \nsession to fund or improve its public-defense system.  Because the executive and legislative \nbranches refuse to take the necessary actions to fix Idaho's public-defense system, it falls on this \nCourt to ensure that \"[ c ]onstitutional rights, as well as this Court's duty to faithfully interpret our \nconstitution and the federal constitution, do not wane before united efforts of the legislature and \n1 \nthe governor.\" \n3.  Plaintiffs Tracy Tucker, Jason Sharp, Naomi Morley, and Jeremy Payne bring this civil \nrights class-action lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on behalf of themselves and all those \nsimilarly situated.  They seek declaratory and injunctive relief for defendants haled before state \ncourts throughout Idaho from the ongoing injuries and harm caused by the continuing failure of \nDefendants (the \"State\") to provide effective legal representation to indigent criminal defendants \nacross the State ofldaho, in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution, of Article 1, Section 13, of the Idaho Constitution, and Idaho statutes and \nregulations. \n4.  Plaintiff Tracy Tucker was arrested in Bonner County on March 6, 2015, after being \ncharged with attempted strangulation and domestic battery in the presence of a child.  Although \n1 Miles v.  Idaho Power Co., 116 Idaho 635, 640 (1989). \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-3 \n\nhe was assigned a public defender, Mr. Tucker was not represented by counsel at his initial \nappearance, during which the court set his bail at $40,000.  Without the guiding hand of counsel \nat that initial proceeding, Mr. Tucker was unable to make any arguments to the court to justify a \nreduction in the bail amount.  Since Mr. Tucker could not afford to post bail, he remained in the \nBonner County Jail for the next three months.  During his time in custody, Mr. Tucker met with \nhis attorney just three times, for a total of approximately 20 minutes.  Two of those \"meetings\" \noccurred in court, during Mr. Tucker's subsequent court appearances.  In addition, during his \nthree months in jail, Mr. Tucker attempted, unsuccessfully, to reach his attorney by phone more \nthan 50 times.  As of 10 days prior to Mr. Tucker's trial date, his attorney's demanding schedule \nhad prevented him from conducting any meaningful investigation into Mr. Tucker's case, \nreviewing and explaining to Mr. Tucker the relevant discovery materials, or discussing trial \nstrategy with Mr. Tucker.  On June 2, 2015, Mr. Tucker pleaded guilty to attempted \nstrangulation, at which time he was released from jail.  Mr. Tucker is scheduled to be sentenced \non August 3, 2015, and faces up to 15 years in prison. \n5.  Plaintiff Jason Sharp was arrested in Shoshone County on May 16,2014, pursuant to a \nwarrant charging him with burglary and grand theft.  Although he was assigned a public \ndefender, Mr. Sharp was not represented by counsel at his initial appearance on May 20, 2014, \nduring which the cout1 set his bail at $50,000.  Mr. Sharp was unable to make the necessary \narguments to the cout1 to justify a reduction in the bail amount at that initial proceeding.  Since \nMr. Sharp could not afford to post bail, he remained in the Shoshone County Jail for \napproximately two weeks.  Without the help of his lawyer, Mr. Sharp was subsequently able to \nconvince the court that his bail amount was inappropriate because it was based on the erroneous \nbelief that he was on probation at the time of his arrest.  The court eventually agreed and reduced \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-4 \n\nhis bond to $5,000.  Unf01tunately, Mr. Sharp was still unable to afford to pay his bail.  Fearing \nthat he would lose his job if he remained in jail, Mr. Sharp contacted his employer, who agreed \nto write a letter to the court vouching for Mr. Sharp and recommending his release.  The court \nreleased Mr. Sharp from custody after receiving the letter of support from his employer.  Over \nthe course of the last year since his release, however, Mr. Sharp has been unable to communicate \neffectively with his attorney regarding the status of his case.  For instance, despite repeated \nrequests from Mr. Sharp, his attorney has not yet provided him with a copy of the discovery \nmaterials in his case, leaving Mr. Sharp unclear about what evidence the State does or does not \nhave against him, and making it impossible for Mr. Sharp to patticipate meaningfully in the \ndevelopment of his defense. Moreover, aside from several motions to continue his jury trial, Mr. \nSharp's attorney has not filed any substantive motions on his behalf.  Even the court's decision \nto reduce Mr. Sharp's bond to $5,000, and ultimately to release him on his own recognizance, \nwas the result of Mr. Sharp's own advocacy in court and his employer's willingness to support \nhim, rather than a response to any motion filed by his attorney.  Mr. Sharp is scheduled to go to \ntrial on July 14,2015, and faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted on both counts. \n6.  PlaintiffNaomi Morley was arrested in Ada County on March 14,2014, following a \nserious single-car accident in which she was severely injured.  Ms. Morley, who was 56 years \nold at the time of her arrest, was charged with driving under the influence and possession of a \ncontrolled substance after officers purportedly discovered prescription medication and drug \nparaphernalia.  Although an Ada County public defender was present during Ms. Morley's initial \nappearance by video, Ms. Morley did not have an opportunity to speak with that lawyer and, \nultimately, the Ada County Public Defender's office determined that it had a conflict of interest \nin representing Ms. Morley.  The Court set Ms. Morley's bail at $15,000 at her initial \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF- 5 \n\nappearance.  Since she could not afford bail, Ms. Morley remained in the Ada County Jail until \nher bail was reduced three weeks later, notwithstanding the recent serious injuries she had \nsustained.  Since then, Ms. Morley's attorneys have been unable to provide her with adequate \nrepresentation.  For instance, Ms. Morley was told that if she wanted to retain an expert to \nchallenge the State's contentions regarding the alleged presence of drugs in her system at the \ntime of the accident, and/or to do any outside testing to challenge the prosecution's allegations, \nshe would have to pay for such services herself.  Also, despite informing her lawyer that another \nperson would confess responsibility, it was only through Ms. Morley's own effotis that she \nrecently obtained a sworn affidavit from the person acknowledging responsibility.  On \ninformation and belief, Ms. Morley's lawyer's caseload has been so large, and his resources so \nfew, that he has been unable to review Ms. Morley's extensive comments on the police reports in \nher case or to investigate the vehicle involved in the accident before the state scrapped it, \ndestroying that evidence.  Further, Ms. Morley has been unable to communicate effectively or \nconsistently with her attorney, and is concerned that her attorney is pressuring her to plead guilty \nbecause he does not have the time or resources to prepare sufficiently for trial.  Most recently, \nMs. Morley turned down a plea offer that would have required her to spend 10 years in prison. \nShe is scheduled to go to trial on June 29, 2015, and faces over 15 years in prison if convicted on \nall counts. \n7.  Plaintiff Jeremy Payne was incarcerated at the Payette County Jail on January 25, 2015, \nafter being arrested for possession of a controlled substance and drug paraphernalia.  Although \nMr. Payne was assigned a public defender, he was not represented by counsel at his initial \nappearance, during which the court set his bail at $30,000.  Since he was not able to afford bail, \nMr. Payne remained in jail pending resolution of his case.  Mr. Payne was released from Payette \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-6 \n\nCounty Jail on June 9, 2015, after the State failed to take the case to trial in a timely fashion. \nUnfortunately, during the five months he was in custody, Mr. Payne was unable to communicate \nwith his attorney on a consistent basis.  In light of the many other felony cases assigned to his \nattorney, Mr. Payne only met with counsel twice at the County Jail, both for very shot1 periods of \ntime.  Aside from those brief meetings, Mr. Payne has only met with his attorney in coutt-for \neven shorter periods of time-just prior to his court appearances, and has been unable to contact \nhis attorney by phone despite repeated attempts.  Indeed, Mr. Payne has spent a total of \napproximately 30-45 minutes with his attorney since the inception of his case.  Moreover, to \ndate, Mr. Payne's attorney has been unable to conduct any meaningful investigation into his \ncase, review the relevant discovery with his client, or share with Mr. Payne his thoughts with \nregard to trial strategy and related matters.  Mr. Payne's preliminary hearing was waived and his \ntrial has now been continued three times.  Mr. Payne is now scheduled to go to trial on July 21, \n2015, and faces up to seven years in prison if convicted. \n8.  Sadly, the circumstances surrounding the named Plaintiffs' representations are not unique \nto them.  Rather, they exemplify the experiences of thousands of indigent defendants across the \nState, who have been denied their right to effective counsel as a result of the State's failure to \nprovide the necessary resources, robust oversight, and specialized training required to ensure that \nall public defenders can handle all of their cases effectively and in compliance with state and \nfederal law. \n9.  Despite amendments to Idaho's public-defender statutes that were passed in 2014 through \na bill enacted as the \"Idaho Public Defense Act,\" the current, patchwork  public-defense \narrangement in Idaho remains riddled with constitutional deficiencies and fails, at all stages of \nthe prosecution and adjudication processes, to ensure adequate representation for indigent \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF -7 \n\ndefendants in both criminal and juvenile proceedings in Idaho.  Although the State has been \nkeenly aware of this failure to provide for the basic rights of indigent criminal defendants for \nyears, without a guiding state-wide scheme, the majority of Idaho counties have failed to \nimplement standards and requirements that satisfy either statutory or constitutional mandates. \nThis has created a flawed system that forces many inexperienced and inadequately trained \nattorneys to juggle too many cases without enough resources.  The result is constitutionally \ndeficient representation of indigent defendants across the state. \nI 0. Certainly, if public-defense attorneys in Idaho had their way, they would be well \nequipped with the resources and training necessary to do their jobs effectively at all stages of the \nproceedings against their clients.  But, due to the State's pervasive and persistent constitutional \nand statutory failures-including, but not limited to, the State's failure to provide adequate \nfunding or relevant state-wide directives-public defenders are not able to provide the zealous \nrepresentation constitutionally required of them in all of their cases. \n11. Indigent defendants in most Idaho counties, including the named Plaintiffs, are not \nrepresented by counsel at their initial appearances, during which a number of critical events often \noccur, including bail determinations, setting of pretrial release conditions, waivers of rights, \nentry of pleas, sentencing, and off-the-record discussions between the prosecutor and the \ndefendant-and sometimes the presiding judge-regarding the defendant's case. \n12. Because public defenders in most instances do not have the staff or resources to be \npresent at initial appearances, indigent defendants are most often left to fend for themselves \nduring these critical proceedings, without the assistance of counsel.  Counsel at this stage is \nespecially important to, among other things, presenting reasoned legal arguments to reduce bail \n(including, but not limited to, arguments related to the strength of the State's case, as well as the \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF- 8 \n\ndefendant's income, ability to pay, and ties to the community), advising their clients about how \nto plead, and negotiating with prosecutors regarding potential plea agreements and pretrial \nrelease terms.  Further, the absence of counsel at initial appearances causes or contributes to the \nunnecessary detention of indigent defendants-sometimes for extended periods of time-who \nmay otherwise have been released while they await resolution of their cases; limited ability of \nindigent defendants to interact with their lawyers, provide and review case materials, and assist \nin the evaluation of their cases and preparation of their defenses; significant impact to indigent \ndefendants' work and family lives; insincere, uninformed, or uneducated pleas entered, partly or \nentirely, in order to obtain immediate release; and other adverse impacts, many times with \nlifelong consequences. \n13. Even after counsel has been appointed, indigent defendants in many counties, including \ndefendants not in custody, lack sufficient access to the public defenders assigned to their cases. \nFor example, defendants frequently do not have the opportunity to meet with their public \ndefenders for purposes of receiving and reviewing the discovery materials related to their cases. \nUnder such conditions, it is nearly impossible for defendants to assist in their own defenses or to \nunderstand and remain abreast of developments in their own cases. \n14. Moreover, in many Idaho counties, there are disincentives for public defenders to engage \nexperts or investigators because such costs may not be covered by public-defender contracts. \nAccordingly, public defenders routinely forgo the use of investigators and experts to carry out \nbasic tasks, such as identifying and interviewing witnesses, and reviewing and analyzing \nevidence.  In most instances, defense counsel must request additional resources from the court to \nhire an investigator or an expert, and, upon information and belief, such requests are rarely made, \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-9 \n\nin part because some public defenders believe that the available resources are so limited that the \nrequests should be reserved only for extraordinary situations. \n15. These disincentives are caused, in large part, by the fixed-fee contract structure used in a \nnumber of Idaho counties, under which contracting attorneys are paid a flat fee in exchange for \ntheir representation of indigent defendants, irrespective of the number of clients the attorney may \nbe assigned during the term of the contract, or the nature of those clients' criminal charges.  A \nrecent county-by-county survey revealed that at least 19 Idaho counties continue to use a fixed-\nfee contract system to secure legal representation for indigent defendants, even though the Idaho \nCode expressly prohibits it.  Such a system creates significant conflicts of interest by creating \npowerful incentives for the contracting attorney to spend as little time and money as possible on \nany given case-to the obvious detriment of indigent clients. \n16. In addition, public-defender caseloads in counties across the state are significantly higher \nthan the national standards, making it difficult, if not impossible, for attorneys to provide their \nclients with the zealous representation to which they are entitled.  According to a December 2014 \nanalysis conducted by Idaho's Legislative Services Office (\"LSO\"), in at least six Idaho \ncounties, individual public defenders are responsible for handling more than twice the work that \none attorney should ever take on.  Individual public defenders in an additional 19 Idaho counties \nare responsible for handling the work of more than one attorney (but fewer than two ).2 \n17. On information and belief, the current case loads carried by public defenders in most \nIdaho counties are only slightly better, if not worse, than those highlighted in the National Legal \nAid and Defender Association 2010 report (\"NLADA Repoti\") on Idaho's public-defense \nsystem.  For instance, in Kootenai County, identified in the NLADA Report as one of the few \n2 Idaho Legislative Services Office - Report on 2013 Case loads, available at \nhttp://1egislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/20 14/interim/pdefl 028  lso.pdf. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF -10 \n\nbright spots with respect to public-defense services in Idaho, public defenders continue to work \nunder crushing case loads.  In 2014, four of the office's 15 attorneys handled well over 400 cases \neach, the bulk of which were felonies and misdemeanors.  Another four defenders handled over \n300 cases in 2014, including a mixture offelonies, misdemeanors, juvenile cases, and other \nproceedings for which the Public Defender's Office is responsible.  Such caseloads are well \nabove national standards and impossible for one person to handle effectively. \n18. The issues associated with the overwhelming caseloads of Idaho public defenders are \nmade worse by the fact that at least 26 Idaho counties permit contract public defenders to \nmaintain a private practice, often without tracking the number of private cases being handled by \nthe contracting attorney at any given time. Most of those counties (22 of them) also rely on \nfixed-fee contracts.  This creates an even greater economic incentive for public defenders to \ndeprioritize their indigent clients in favor of their paying clients. \n19. Further, many Idaho counties do not have the resources or expertise to provide the kind \nof specialized training or supervision to ensure that representation of indigent defendants is \nconsistent with the State's constitutional mandates.  According to a recent state-wide assessment \nby the Idaho State Public Defense Commission (\"PDC\"), \"a significant number of indigent \ndefense attorneys in the State are not receiving adequate training hours in areas directly relevant \nto the representation of their indigent clients.\"3 \n20. These deficiencies are further exacerbated by the lack of true independence afforded to \npublic defenders across the state.  Under the current supervisory structure, public defenders \nreport to their respective county commissioners, many of whom are not attorneys or are \notherwise unqualified to oversee a legal practice-let alone one requiring specialized knowledge \n3 Idaho State Public Defense Commission, 2015 Report to the Legislature, 9. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF- 11 \n\nof criminal law.  For example, in Bonner County, the commissioners hold degrees in \nHistory/Business Systems Management, Aeronautics, and Education, respectively.  None has any \nformal legal training or practice experience.  The same is true in Bingham County, where it \nappears that only two of the three commissioners attended college, and none has a background in \nthe law.  Yet in some counties, commissioners have extensive authority related to criminal-law \nmatters, including the authority to approve or reject requests for additional resources, and to \nterminate or choose not to renew the public defender's contract, leaving the defenders beholden \nto the often-uninformed whims of their supervisors. \n21. All of these deficiencies have combined to create a constitutional crisis with respect to \nindigent defense delivery in Idaho-a crisis that federal and state law require the State to address \nin a meaningful, expedient, and substantive way. \nBACKGROUND \n22. The State of Idaho has a long history of recognizing the right to counsel for those \ncriminal defendants who are unable to afford an attorney.  As early as 1864, Idaho law required \nthat a defendant \"be informed by the court that it is his right to have counsel before being \narraigned,\" and that he \"be asked if he desires the aid of counsel.\"4 \n23. In 1887, the Idaho legislature went a step further, passing a law requiring trial courts to \nadvise defendants of the right to counsel during arraignments on criminal charges, and to appoint \ncounsel if the defendant requested an attorney but was unable to afford one. 5 \n4 Cr.  Prac. 1864 § 267. \n5 See R.S., R.C., & C.L. § 7721 (1887); I.C. § 19-1512 (1967). \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF- 12 \n\n24. Once the appointment was made, defense counsel were to \"be paid out of the county \ntreasury, upon order of the judge of the court, such sum as the court may deem reasonable for the \nservices rendered.\"6 \n25. Following achievement of statehood in 1890, Idaho lawmakers included the right to \ncounsel in the state constitution.  Specifically, Article 1, Section 13 ofthe Idaho Constitution \nstates that criminal defendants have a right to \"appear and defend in person and with counsel.\" \n26. Since then, the Idaho judiciary has consistently interpreted this constitutional provision, \nas well as related statutes, as requiring the provision of counsel to indigent defendants at public \nexpense.7 \n27. By the time the United States Supreme Court decided Gideon v.  Wainwright8 in 1963, \nsome 37 states-including Idaho-had already committed to providing counsel for indigent \ndefendants, upon request, in all felony cases.  Indeed, then-Idaho Attorney General Frank \nBenson was one of22 attorneys general to sign on to an amicus brief submitted to the U.S. \nSupreme Court in suppot1 of the plaintiffs claims in Gideon. \n28. After Gideon, the U.S. Supreme Com1 continued to expand the right to counsel in \nsignificant ways. The Court has extended the right to counsel to children in juvenile \ndelinquency proceedings, see In re Gault;9 probationers in probation revocation proceedings, see \nMempa v.  Rhay; 10 and indigent defendants charged with misdemeanors, see Argersinger v. \n6 I.C. § 19-1513 (Repealed). \n7 See State v. Montroy, 217 P. 611, 614 (1923) \n8  u.s. \n372  335 (1963). \n9 387 u.s. 1 (1967). \n10 389 U.S. 128 (1967). \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF -13 \n\nHamlin.11  More recently, the Court found that the right to counsel attaches for all defendants at \ntheir initial appearances, see Rothgery v.  Gillespie County, Tex.; 12 and that plea bargaining \nconstitutes a \"critical stage\" of any criminal proceeding, thereby requiring the effective \nassistance of counsel in connection with plea negotiations, see Lafler v.  Cooper13 and Missouri \nv. rLr' ye. 14 \n29. Idaho, on the other hand, has taken several steps backward in the half-century since \nGideon.  Rather than making good on its early efforts and serving as a model for other states to \nfollow, the State of Idaho has failed to ensure-through lack of sufficient oversight, training, and \nfunding-that people accused of crimes within its borders who are unable to afford an attorney \nare provided with constitutionally adequate legal assistance.  As a result, Idaho has become the \nepitome of an indigent-defense system in crisis, notwithstanding the 2014 amendments to the \npublic-defense statutes, which have done very little to address the underlying causes of the \nState's indigent-defense problem. \nNational Legal Aid and Defender Association Analysis ofI daho's Indigent-Defense Services \n30. In its 2007 management audit ofldaho's State Appellate Public Defender, the National \nLegal Aid and Defender Association (\"NLADA\") concluded that the caseload problems plaguing \nIdaho's appellate public defenders at that time could likely be addressed by improving trial-level \nindigent defense services across the state. \n11 407 U.S. 25 (1972). \n12 554 u.s. 191 (2008). \n13 132 S. Ct. 1376 (2012). \n14 132 S. Ct. 1399 (20 12). \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF -14 \n\n31. Following the release of the audit, the Idaho Criminal Justice Commission (\"CJC\")-\ncreated by Executive Order in 2005-and composed primarily of various State officials involved \nin the criminal-justice system-authorized the NLADA to conduct a comprehensive study of the \nState's trial-level indigent-defense system. \n32. In January 20 l 0, the NLADA released its evaluation of trial-level indigent-defense \nservices in Idaho (\"NLADA Report\"). The Report included an assessment of services being \nprovided to both adults and children in the criminal justice system, and focused specifically on \nseven counties.15 \n33. The NLADA's assessment was rooted in the American Bar Association's Ten Principles \nof a Public Defense Delivery System, promulgated in February 2002.  According to the ABA, the \nTen Principles are an interdependent set of standards that \"constitute the fundamental criteria \nnecessary to design a system that provides effective, efficient, high quality, ethical, conflict-free \nlegal representation\" to indigent defendants.16 \n34. The NLADA found that, for thousands of defendants across Idaho, the constitutional \nrequirements of Gideon and its progeny have been left unfulfilled, and the standards set forth in \nthe ABA's Ten Principles have gone largely unmet.17 \n15 The counties highlighted in the NLADA Report are Ada, Blaine, Bonneville, Canyon, \nKootenai, Nez Perce, and Power Counties. \n16 ABA Ten Principles of a Public Defense Delivery System (Feb. 2002), at Introduction, \navailable at \nhttp://www .americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/adm inistrative/legal_a id _indigent_ defendants/Is_ s \nclaid _ def_t enprinciplesbooklet.authcheckdam.pdf \n17 NATIONAL LEGAL AID AND DEFENDER ASSOCIATION, THE GUARANTEE OF COUNSEL: \nADVOCACY & DUE PROCESS IN IDAHO'S TRIAL COURTS: EVALUATION OF TRIAL-LEVEL INDIGENT \nDEFENSE SYSTEMS IN IDAHO 2-3 (2010). \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF -15 \n\n35. The NLADA Report futther asserts that, in direct contravention ofthe Ten Principles, the \nState has failed to ensure adequate training and supervision for public defenders, making it \nnearly impossible to assess whether public defenders are meeting the standards established by \nGideon and its progeny.18 \n36. The State has foisted this essential function on each of its 44 counties without providing \nany monetary or supervisory support to the counties for trial-level public defense, aside from the \nlimited funds allocated by the Public Defense Commission in 2014 to create additional, non \nmandatory training opportunities for individual defenders who choose to take advantage of them. \nAs the NLADA found, \"[b] y delegating to each county the responsibility to provide counsel at \nthe trial level without any state funding or oversight, Idaho has sewn a patchwork quilt of \nunderfunded, inconsistent systems that vary greatly in defining who qualifies for services and in \nthe level of competency ofthe services rendered.\"19  The 2014 amendments to the public-defense \nstatutes failed to remedy this deficiency. \n37. The NLADA identified a number of specific areas of concern with respect to trial-level \nindigent-defense services delivery in Idaho, many of which are still of concern today.  These \ninclude the widespread use of fixed-fee contracts; extraordinarily high attorney caseloads and \nworkloads; inadequate, and often nonexistent, investigation of cases; lack of structural \nsafeguards to protect the independence of defenders; lack of adequate representation of children \nin juvenile and criminal court; lack of sufficient supervision; lack of performance-based \n18 Id. at 67-73. \n19 Id. at 2. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF -16 \n\nstandards; lack of ongoing training and professional development; and lack of any meaningful \n20 \nfunding from the State. \nRecent Amendments to Idaho's Public-Defense Statutes \n38. In March 2014, despite several years of research and study by the Idaho Criminal Justice \nCommission and a legislative study committee, and in recognition of the need for reform, Idaho \nenacted only meager amendments to its public-defense statutes, found mainly at sections 19-848 \nthrough 19-866 ofthe Idaho Code. \n39. The 2014 amendments (1) establish a public-defense commission, along with its powers \nand duties;21  (2) clarify the duties of law-enforcement officers and/or the courts to notify \ncriminal defendants of their right to counsel;22 (3) identify the various methods by which \ncounties are permitted to provide indigent-defense services;23 and ( 4) encourage parity in \n24 \ncompensation between public defenders and county prosecutors.\n40. Under the amended statutes, counties may provide indigent-defense services by either (I) \nestablishing and maintaining an office of public defender; (2) joining with the board of county \ncommissioners of one or more counties within the same judicial district to establish and maintain \na joint office of public defender; (3) contracting with an existing office of public defender; or ( 4) \ncontracting with a defending attorney, provided that the terms ofthe contract do not include any \n20 !d. at iii-viii; 3-9. \n21  I.C. §§ 19-849 (2014) and 19-850 (2014). \n22 I.C. § 19-853 (2014). \n23 I.C. § 19-859 (2014). \n24 l.C. § 19-860 (2014). \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF- 17 \n\npricing structures that charge or pay a single fixed fee for the services and expenses of the \nattorney. 25 \n26 \n41. Of Idaho's 44 counties, seven have established an office of public defender, while just \ntwo have partnered to form a joint office of public defender. 27  One county neither maintains a \npublic-defender office nor a contract for the provision of indigent-defense services, choosing \ninstead to have the court appoint attorneys on an ad hoc basis, even though the 2014 amendments \neliminated such a system from the list of acceptable options.28  The remaining 34 counties \nprovide indigent-defense services pursuant to a contractual agreement with a defending attorney \n29 \nor law firm, 19 of which operate under fixed-fee contracts.\n42. Under the amended statutes, a county must \"annually appropriate enough money to \nadminister the program of representation that it has elected under section 19-859, Idaho Code[,]\" \nbut the State is still not required to contribute any funding toward the provision of trial-level \n. d'  d \nIn  tgent- e1C' ense servt• ces. 30 \n43.

C.  § 19-859 (I)-(4  ). \n26 \nThese are Ada, Bannock, Bonner, Bonneville, Canyon, Kootenai, and Twin Falls Counties. \n27 These are Minidoka and Cassia Counties. \n28 \nThis is Washington County. \n29 \nSee Idaho State Public Defense Commission, 2015 Report to the Legislature, 5-7. \n30 I.C. § 19-862(1) (2014). \n31 I.C. § 19-850(1)(b). \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF -18 \n\n44. The PDC is futiher responsible for making recommendations to the Idaho legislature, \nincluding an initial round of recommendations that was due by January 20, 2015, regarding a \nnumber of issues, including core requirements for indigent-defense contracts, qualifications and \nexperience standards for defending attorneys, enforcement mechanisms, and funding.32  Yet, as \nofthe date ofthis Complaint, the PDC has failed to make any such recommendations. \n45. Despite the State's acknowledgement that significant reform is necessary in this arena \nby, among other things, the creation of various virtually powerless committees, including the \nestablishment in 2010 of a public-defense subcommittee of the Criminal Justice Commission, the \nestablishment in 2013 of a special committee ofthe legislature to recommend legislative reforms \nto the public-defense system, and the 2014 statutory amendments and formation of the PDC-the \nState has done little to meaningfully address the myriad problems plaguing Idaho's indigent \ndefense system. \n46. Critically, the State still does not provide any funding or supervision to any of the \ncounties with respect to the delivery of indigent-defense services at the trial level. \n47. Each county is still currently responsible for providing indigent-defense services to all \ncriminal defendants within the county who are charged with misdemeanor or felony offenses and \nwho are unable to afford an attorney.  Yet, counties must do so without any meaningful funding, \noversight, or training from the State. \n48. Despite the PDC's responsibility to promulgate rules related to training and data \nreporting requirements for defense attorneys across the state, no such rules have been \npromulgated to date. \n32 !d. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF- 19 \n\n49. Despite the PDC's responsibility to make recommendations to the Idaho legislature \nregarding the core requirements for indigent-defense contracts, qualifications, and experience \nstandards for defense attorneys, enforcement mechanisms, and funding, no such \nrecommendations have been made to date. \n50. Moreover, even if the PDC had promulgated cetiain rules or made specific \nrecommendations, it has no authority to reprimand or sanction counties or individuals that do not \nabide by such rules or recommendations. \n51. For instance, upon information and belief, at least 19 of the 34 Idaho counties that use a \ncontract system currently operate under a fixed-fee pricing structure, despite express statutory \nprohibition against such contracts. \nDefendants' Ongoing Failure to Provide Indigent Defendants with Constitutionally Adequate \nLegal Representation \n52. In addition to the State's failure to meet the minimal requirements of the public-defense \nstatutes, it has also failed to sufficiently address the many state and federal constitutional issues \nidentified in the NLADA Report. \n53. According to a recent study conducted by the Pre-Trial Justice subcommittee of the \nCriminal Justice Commission, only five ofldaho's 44 counties provide counsel to indigent \ndefendants at their initial appearance before a judicial officer, in violation ofldaho law.  Only \none of the named Plaintiffs had counsel present at her initial appearance-and that counsel \nultimately had a conflict of interest preventing counsel from representing her. \n54. As a result of the State's failure to create and enforce a constitutionally consistent scheme \nthat ensures representation for indigent defendants at initial appearances, many defendants, \nincluding the named Plaintiffs, are unable to effectively seek bond reduction or release from \ncustody.  As such, many defendants unnecessarily spend prolonged periods of time in pretrial \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-20 \n\ndetention or feel coerced to plead guilty to charges against which they have a valid and \npotentially effective defense, merely to get out of jail and avoid losing a job or meaningful \ncontact with their children and families. \n55. Public-defender caseloads in counties across the state continue to exceed national \nstandards, in some cases by more than double. 33 \n56. As a result of their crushing case loads and lack of support, Idaho public defenders do not \nhave the time or resources to communicate with all of their clients consistently and effectively. \n57. The State's failure to commit sufficient resources to indigent defense has also made it \nimpossible for public defenders to investigate and otherwise prepare all of their cases thoroughly \nand effectively. \n58. Moreover, the State does not provide public defenders with the specialized training and \nongoing supervision necessary to ensure zealous and effective representation for indigent \ndefendants. \n59. In failing to remedy these deficiencies, the State has caused harm to the Plaintiffs, and \nthose similarly situated, by constructively denying them their Sixth Amendment right to \n34 \ncompetent counsel and their Fourteenth Amendment right to due process.\n60. Pursuant to federal and state law, Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and a class of \n~ similarly situated individuals, seek declaratory and injunctive relief against Defendants to \n33 Idaho Legislative Services Office -Report on 2013 Caseloads, available at \nhttp://legislature.idaho.gov /sessioninfo/20 14/interim/pdefl 028  lso.pdf. \n34 See United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 659 (1984). \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-21 \n\nremedy the rampant denial of constitutional rights to which Idaho's indigent defendants are \nsubjected on a daily basis.35 \nJURISDICTION & VENUE \n61. This Court maintains original, subject-matter jurisdiction over this action under Section \n1-705 ofthe Idaho Code. \n62. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Section 5-402 of the Idaho Code because the \nState of Idaho is named as a defendant in this action, and Ada County encompasses the capital \ncity of Boise. Additionally, the decisions that have caused the failures ofldaho's indigent-\ndefense system were made in Ada County. \nPARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs \nTracy Tucker \n63. Plaintiff TRACY DON TUCKER is and at all times pertinent herein has been a resident \nof Sandpoint, Idaho.  Mr. Tucker was taken into custody on March 6, 2015, after he was charged \nwith attempted strangulation and domestic battery in the presence of a child, exposing him to \nover 15 years in prison.  Mr. Tucker was not represented by counsel at his initial appearance, \nduring which the court set his bail at $40,000.  Mr. Tucker could not afford to post bail, and as a \nresult, he remained in Bonner County Jail until June 2, 2015. \n35 Through this Complaint, Plaintiffs do not, at this time, challenge the components of Idaho's \nindigent-defense system served by the State Appellate Public Defender (see Sections 19-867 \nthrough 19-872 of the Idaho Code), which pertain primarily to felony criminal cases on appeal. \nRather, this Complaint is focused on the State's failure to provide an adequate criminal-justice \nsystem for indigent defendants represented by overloaded and under-resourced defense attorneys \nat the trial level, and in misdemeanor and other appeals not handled by the State Appellate Public \nDefender. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-22 \n\n64. Bonner County relies on contract attorneys, who are paid an annual fixed fee, to represent \nindigent criminal defendants being prosecuted within its jurisdiction. \n65. Although Mr. Tucker was assigned a public defender prior to his next couti appearance, \nhis attorney did not appear on his behalf at his arraignment on March 18, 2015.  Instead, his \npublic defender sent a substitute attorney who had no prior knowledge of Mr. Tucker's case or \neven ofthe charges that Mr. Tucker faced.  On information and belief, the substitute attorney \nfailed to seek a bond reduction or otherwise advocate on Mr. Tucker's behalf. \n66. Given the demands of his caseload, Mr. Tucker's attorney has met Mr. Tucker only on \nthree occasions: once when his attorney came to Bonner County Jail and met with Mr. Tucker \nfor approximately 10 minutes, and two additional times when he saw him in court.  Mr. Tucker's \nattorney did not meet with him prior to either of those court proceedings-not even in the \ncourtroom prior to the proceedings. Mr. Tucker has spoken with his public defender on the \nphone only on two occasions, both for approximately five minutes.  Generally speaking, Mr. \nTucker has also been unable to contact his attorney by phone.  Between March 18, 2015, and \nJune 1, 2015, Mr. Tucker attempted-unsuccessfully-to reach his attorney by phone on at least \n50 occasions. \n67. On information and belief, despite the fact that Mr. Tucker's trial was originally set for \nJune 8, 2015, as of ten days prior to trial, his attorney had not had the chance to conduct any \ninvestigation into the case, contact or summon any witnesses, hire an investigator, review and \nexplain the relevant discovery materials, or discuss trial strategy with Mr. Tucker.  In total, on \ninformation and belief, Mr. Tucker has spent less than 20 minutes with his attorney throughout \nthe course of his representation. Moreover, other than a bail reduction motion, Mr. Tucker's \nattorney never filed any motions on his behalf. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-23 \n\n68. After remaining in jail for three months while unable to discuss a possible defense with \nhis attorney, Mr. Tucker pleaded guilty to attempted strangulation on June 2, 2015.  He is \nscheduled to be sentenced on August 3, 2015. \nJason Sharp \n69. Plaintiff JASON MONROE SHARP is and at all times pertinent herein has been a \nresident of Kellogg, Idaho.  Mr. Sharp was taken into custody on May 16, 2014, after he was \ncharged with burglary and grand theft, exposing him to as much as 30 years in prison.  Mr. Sharp \nwas not represented by counsel at his initial appearance in court, during which his bail was set at \n$50,000.  Mr. Sharp could not afford to post bail, and as a result, he remained in the Shoshone \nCounty Jail for approximately two weeks. \n70. On information and belief, Shoshone County relies on contract attorneys, who are paid an \nannual fixed fee, to represent indigent criminal defendants being prosecuted within its \njurisdiction. \n71. On information and belief, attorney caseloads in Shoshone County vastly exceed national \nstandards and are among the heaviest of any county in Idaho. \n72. Although Mr. Sharp was assigned a public defender at his initial appearance, he has had \nminimal contact with his attorney.  Mr. Sharp had to advocate on his own behalf-without the \nassistance of his lawyer-in favor of a bond reduction.  On information and belief, the court first \nagreed to reduce Mr. Sharp's bail to $5,000, after Mr. Sharp explained that he was not on \nprobation at the time of his arrest, as the court had previously believed.  Then, after receiving a \nletter of support from Mr. Sharp's employer vouching for him and recommending his release, the \ncourt released Mr. Sharp on his own recognizance.  Neither the bail reduction, nor the com1's \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-24 \n\nultimate decision to release Mr. Sharp, were the result of any efforts undertaken by his public \ndefender. \n73. Given the demands of his attorney's caseload, Mr. Sharp has only been able to meet with \nhis attorney for approximately 90 minutes-total-throughout the 13 months during which his \ncase has been pending.  On information and belief, most of those meetings have occurred in or \njust outside the courtroom prior to a hearing.  Mr. Sharp also has been unable to review the \ndiscovery in his case, despite repeated requests. \n74. Although Mr. Sharp is scheduled to go to trial on July 14, 2015, and faces up to 30 years \nin prison if convicted, on information and belief, his attorney has not had the chance to conduct \nany investigation into the case, contact or summon any witnesses, hire an investigator, review \nand explain the relevant discovery materials, or discuss trial strategy with Mr. Sharp. \nNaomi Morley \n75. PlaintiffNAOMI HELEN MORLEY is and at all times pertinent herein has been a \nresident of Garden Valley, Idaho.  Ms. Morley was taken into custody in March 2014, following \na serious single car accident on an Ada County roadway. \n76. Ada County relies on an institutional public-defender office to represent indigent criminal \ndefendants being prosecuted within its jurisdiction.  In the event that the public-defender office is \nunable to represent a defendant due to a conflict of interest, the County relies on conflict counsel \n' \nto provide representation. \n77. Although Ms. Morley was assigned a public defender at her initial appearance before the \ncourt, she had no opportunity to actually confer with the public defender at that initial \nproceeding, during which her bail was set at $15,000.  Ms. Morley could not afford to post bail, \ncausing her to remain in jail for three weeks until her bail was reduced.  It was later discovered \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF- 25 \n\nthat the public defender's office could not represent Ms. Morley due to a conflict of interest. \nConflict counsel was subsequently appointed. \n78. Ms. Morley's attorneys-both her public defender and her conflict attorney-have been \nunable to adequately investigate the charges against her.  Her current attorney has encouraged \nher to accept a plea deal that Ms. Morley understands would require her to spend l 0 years in \nprison, despite her claims of innocence.  When Ms. Morley inquired about the possibility of \nretaining an expert to dispute the findings of any blood sample analysis, she was told that, if she \nwanted to do so-or do any other outside testing to challenge the prosecution's allegations-she \nwould have to pay for the testing herself.  Given her indigent status, this is an expense that Ms. \nMorley cannot afford. \n79. Moreover, Ms. Morley has attempted to discuss the case with her attorney several times, \nbut has been unable to do so in any meaningful way.  Although Ms. Morley told her attorney \nabout a witness who would testify that the controlled substances allegedly found were the \nwitness's and not Ms. Morley's, it was only through her own efforts that Ms. Morley was able to \nobtain a signed affidavit from the witness, who acknowledged, under oath, that any controlled \nsubstances allegedly found belonged to the witness.  Furthermore, when Ms. Morley tried to \ndiscuss certain discrepancies in the police repoti, her attorney was apparently so overloaded with \ncases that he did not have the time to engage with her, and her concerns went unheeded.  On \ninformation and belief, had her attorney had a manageable caseload and thus the time to discuss \nthe facts of her case, as well as her medical history, in greater detail, he would have recognized \nimmediately that she had a valid defense that required thorough investigation.  Ms. Morley is \nscheduled to go to trial on June 29, 2015. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF- 26 \n\nJeremy Payne \n80. Plaintiff JEREMY MICHAEL PAYNE is and at all times pertinent herein has been a \nresident of Payette, Idaho.  Mr. Payne was taken into custody on January 25,2015, after he was \ncharged with driving without a license, as well as possession of a controlled substance and drug \nparaphernalia, exposing him to over seven years in prison.  Mr. Payne was not represented at his \ninitial appearance in court, during which his bail was set at $30,000.  Mr. Payne could not afford \nto post bail, and as a result, he was remanded to the Payette County Jail, where he remained until \nbeing released on June 9, 2015, when the State postponed his trial date for the third time. \n81. Payette County relies on contract attorneys, who are paid an annual fixed fee, to represent \nindigent criminal defendants being prosecuted within its jurisdiction. \n82. Although Mr. Payne was assigned a public defender at his initial appearance, he did not \nhave any contact with his attorney until the minutes leading up to his next court appearance on \nFebruary 6, 2015.  In the months that followed, Mr. Payne went before the court three more \ntimes and again met briefly with his attorney either in cout1 just prior to the proceedings, or in \njail the day before the cout1 appearance.  Given the demands of his caseload, Mr. Payne's \nattorney only met with him at the Payette County Jail on three occasions.  Mr. Payne has also \nbeen unable to contact his attorney by phone.· During the two-week period between May 12 and \nMay 26, Mr. Payne left at least six phone messages for his attorney, none of which were \nreturned. \n83. At Mr. Payne's pretrial hearing on April 17,2015, his attorney informed him that in order \nto move forward with his jury trial in June 2015, he would have to waive his right to a speedy \ntrial.  However, his attorney failed to adequately explain the consequences of the waiver, and the \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-27 \n\nfact that Mr. Payne's refusal to waive his speedy trial right could result in his release from \ncustody. \n84. On information and belief, despite that Mr. Payne's trial has now been rescheduled three \ntimes, Mr. Payne's attorney has not had the chance to conduct any investigation into the case, \nnor has the attorney reviewed and explained the relevant discovery materials or discussed trial \nstrategy with Mr. Payne.  In total, Mr. Payne has only spent approximately 30-45 minutes with \nhis attorney throughout the course of his representation. \nB.  Defendants \n85. Defendant STATE OF IDAHO has violated and continues to violate the Idaho and \nfederal constitutions, which require it to ensure that adequate indigent-defense services are \nprovided to Idaho's poorest citizens.  The State Capital and center of State government is in Ada \nCounty. \n86. Defendant C.L.  \"BUTCH\" OTTER is the Governor ofthe state of Idaho and is subject to \nthis lawsuit in his official capacity as to all claims herein.  As the chief executive of the state, \nGovernor Otter bears ultimate responsibility for the provision of constitutionally mandated \nservices to the people of Idaho.  In 2005, the CJC was created by Executive Order and tasked \nwith addressing \"important criminal justice issues and challenges.\"  Governor Otter maintains \nsupervisory authority over the CJC. \n87. Defendants Hon. Molly Huskey, Darrell G. Bolz, Sara B. Thomas, William H. Wellman, \nKimber Ricks, Sen. Chuck Winder, and Rep. Christy Perry are all of the members Idaho's Public \nDefense Commission.  They are subject to this lawsuit in their official capacities as members of \nthe Commission.  The Commission is responsible for promulgating rules related to training and \ndata-reporting requirements for defense attorneys across the state, and making recommendations \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-28 \n\nto the legislature regarding core requirements for indigent-defense contracts, qualifications, and \n. experience standards for defending attorneys, enforcement mechanisms, and funding. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n88. Plaintiffs bring this class action lawsuit pursuant to Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 23 on \nbehalf of all indigent persons who are now or who will be under formal charge before a state \ncourt in Idaho of having committed any offense, the penalty for which includes the possibility of \nconfinement, incarceration, imprisonment, or detention in a correction facility (regardless of \nwhether actually imposed) and who are unable to provide for the full payment of an attorney and \nall other necessary expenses of representation in defending against the charge. \n89. The Plaintiffs in this case represent a class (the \"Class\"), and this action should be \ncertified as a class action under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 23. \n90. Every day, hundreds, if not thousands, of individuals who are unable to afford an attorney \nand who depend on the State of Idaho to provide them with effective legal representation are \n36 \ncriminally prosecuted in Idaho.  As such, the Class is so numerous that joinder of all members \nis impractical. \n91. There are important questions of law and fact raised in this case that are common to the \nClass, including: \na.  Whether the State is required under the United States and Idaho Constitutions, \nand under Idaho law, to provide indigent defendants with effective legal \nrepresentation, including at the time of initial appearance; \nb.  Whether the State is currently providing constitutionally sufficient representation \nfor indigent defendants in their respective jurisdictions; \n36 Idaho Legislative Services Office- CFY 2014 Budget & Policy Analysis, Figure 3.0, \navailable at http:// legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/20 14/interim/pdefl 028_  hoskins.pdf. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-29 \n\nc.  Whether the State has violated the United States and Idaho Constitutions by \nfailing to implement, administer, and oversee adequate public-defense systems; \nd.  Whether, by abdicating its responsibility to fund, supervise, and administer \nindigent defense services to the  counties, the State has failed to ensure that \nindigent defendants are provided with effective legal representation, all in \nviolation ofthe United States and Idaho Constitutions; \ne.  Whether the State's failure to adequately fund and supervise the delivery of \nindigent-defense services impedes the provision of effective legal representation \nto indigent defendants; and \nf.  Whether the State's failure to develop uniform workload and performance \nstandards for public-defense attorneys in Idaho impedes the provision of effective \nlegal representation to indigent defendants. \n92. The claims of the Class representatives are typical of the claims of the Class as a whole. \nLike all of the Class members, the Class representatives are being denied their right to counsel, \nin violation of the Sixth Amendment to the U.S.  Constitution and Article I, Section 13, of the \nIdaho Constitution, as a direct result of State's ongoing failure to adequately fund, supervise, and \nadminister indigent-defense services in Idaho. \n93. The Class representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. \nThe interests of the Class representatives are not in conflict with the interests of any other \nindigent defendant, and the Class representatives have every incentive to pursue this litigation \nvigorously on behalf of themselves and the Class as a whole.  Moreover, the Class \nrepresentatives are being represented by experienced, well-resourced counsel in this matter, \nincluding the American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho, the national American Civil Liberties \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-30 \n\nUnion's Criminal Law Reform Project, and the law firm of Hogan Love lis US LLP, whose \nattorneys possess substantial expertise in prosecuting class action lawsuits generally, and in \nindigent-defense reform litigation in particular. \n94. The prosecution of separate actions by individual members of the Class would create a \nrisk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the Class, \nwhich would establish incompatible standards of conduct, exacerbating the differing and \ninadequate public-defender programs currently in place in various counties in the State.  Such a \nrisk is of particular concern in this case since the lack of uniform performance standards is \ncentral to the Plaintiffs' allegations. \n95. The common questions of law and fact articulated above predominate over any case \nspecific questions that may arise out of any of the individual Class members' criminal cases. As \nsuch, a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication \nof this matter. \n96. Defendants have failed to adequately fund, supervise, and administer indigent- defense \nservices in Idaho, thereby violating the rights of poor defendants across the state.  As such, these \nDefendants have acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the entire Class, \nthereby making it appropriate for this Court to issue final injunctive and declaratory relief for all \nClass members. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nOverview of the Current State ofI ndigent-Defense in Idaho \n97. The State ofldaho leaves the responsibility for providing trial-levellegal representation \nto indigent criminal defendants to each of its 44 counties. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-31 \n\n98. Yet the State does not provide any funding, training, or supervision to support the \ndelivery of indigent-defense services at the trial level. \n99. According to the NLADA Report, as well as the more recent county-by-county surveys \nconducted by the Idaho Criminal Justice Commission and the ACLU, respectively, no county in \nIdaho is currently providing indigent-defense services that meet state or federal legal standards. \nI 00.  State officials themselves have recognized the current constitutional crisis \nregarding indigent defense services in Idaho.  In August 2013, the Chief Justice of the Idaho \nSupreme Court noted that \"our system for the defense of indigents, as required by Idaho's \nconstitution and laws, is broken.\"  And Governor Otter acknowledged in his 2015 State of the \nState address that, despite the 2014 amendments to Idaho's public defense statutes, \"our current \nmethod of providing legal counsel for indigent criminal defendants does not pass constitutional \nmuster.\" \n101.  These constitutional and statutory deficiencies manifest themselves in myriad \nways, including (1) failure to provide counsel to indigent defendants at their initial appearance; \n(2) extended and unnecessary pretrial detention; (3) excessive caseloads that far exceed national \nstandards; ( 4) lack of sufficient investigation; (5) lack of sufficient expert analysis and \ntestimony; (6) lack of consistent, effective, and confidential communication between indigent \ndefendants and public defenders; (7) continued use of fixed-fee contracts for attorneys providing \nindigent-defense services; (8) lack of public-defender independence; (9) lack of sufficient \ntraining in the field of criminal defense; (1 0) lack of informed and consistent oversight of the \nprovision of indigent-defense services throughout the State; and (11) lack of sufficient \nsupervision and evaluation. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF- 32 \n\n102.  Each of these deficiencies is directly linked to the State's longstanding and on-\ngoing failure to provide the funding, supervision, and training necessary to meet its legal \nobligations in the area of indigent defense. \nLack ofR  epresentation at Initial Appearance \nI 03.  Under Idaho law, \"[e  ]very defendant, who according to law is entitled to \nappointed counsel, shall have counsel assigned to represent the defendant, from initial \nappearance before the magistrate or district court, unless the defendant waives such \n,37 \nappom0  tment. \n104.  Section 19-852 of the Idaho Code guarantees that an indigent person \"under \nformal charge of having committed, or [] being detained under a conviction of a serious crime . \nis entitled to be represented by an attorney.\"38 \n105.  Section 19-851 (d) defines \"serious crime\" as \"any offense the penalty for which \nincludes the possibility of confinement, incarceration, imprisonment or detention in a \n39 \ncorrectional facility, regardless of whether actually imposed.\"\n106.  An initial appearance is defined by Idaho Criminal Rule 5(a) as \"the first \nappearance of the defendant before any magistrate,\" during which the judge or magistrate may, \n40 \namong other things, set bail and take a plea from the defendant.\n37 I.C.R. 44(a). \n38 l.C. § 19-852. \n39 r.c. § 19-851(d). \n40 See I.C.R. 5(a) \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-33 \n\nI07.  In 20I4, the Pre-Trial Justice subcommittee ofthe CJC conducted a survey of all \n44 Idaho counties to determine, among other things, the number of counties that provide counsel \nfor indigent defendants at their initial appearance before a judge or magistrate. \n108.  According to the CJC survey, only five Idaho counties provide counsel for \nindigent defendants at their initial appearances, despite the critical nature of such proceedings. \nI 09.  None of the named Plaintiffs was represented by counsel at his or her initial \nappearance. \nI I 0.  Plaintiff Tucker was not represented by counsel at his initial appearance, even \nthough he was charged with a serious felony and had his bail set at $40,000.  Because he could \nnot afford to pay his bail and had no attorney available to argue for a bond reduction on his \nbehalf, Mr. Tucker remained in jail for three months before pleading guilty. \n111.  Plaintiff Sharp was not represented by counsel at his initial appearance, even \nthough he was charged with two serious felonies and had his bail set at $50,000.  Because he \ncould not afford to pay his bail and had no attorney available to argue for a bond reduction on his \nbehalf, Mr. Sharp remained in jail for two weeks until he was able to convince the couti \nwithout the assistance of his attorney-to reduce his bond. \n1 I2.  An attorney from the Ada County Public Defender's office was present during \nPlaintiff Morley's initial appearance, but Ms. Morley did not have an opportunity to discuss her \ncase with counsel at that time, and that office soon after determined that it had a conflict of \ninterest and could not represent Ms. Morley.  Ms. Morley's bail was set at $I5,000 at her initial \nappearance.  Because she could not afford to pay his bail and had no attorney available to argue \nfor a bond reduction on her behalf, she remained in custody for three weeks until her bail was \nreduced. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-34 \n\n113.  Plaintiff Payne was not represented by counsel at his initial appearance, even \nthough the proceeding included the court's decision to set Mr. Payne's bail at $30,000.  He could \nnot afford to pay his bail and had no attorney available to argue for a bond reduction on his \nbehalf.  Mr. Payne remained in jail until June 9, 2015, when the state asked the court to postpone \nMr. Payne's trial for a third time. \n114.  On information and belief, criminal defendants in Bingham County routinely \nenter pleas at their initial appearances without having had the opportunity to consult with an \nattorney.  Indeed, at initial appearances held on May 28, 2015, defendants were asked to enter a \nplea to the charges against them without counsel present and without having affirmatively \nwaived their right to counsel or even having been informed by the judge of their right to counsel. \nMore than half pleaded guilty and were sentenced without counsel present. \nUnnecessmy and/or Extended Pre-Trial Detention \n115.  Due in pat1 to the lack of legal advocacy available to indigent defendants at their \ninitial appearances, bail is often set at unnecessarily high amounts that low-income defendants \ncannot afford.  For instance, Plaintiff Sharp's bail was originally set at $50,000, without any \ndiscussion between the court and Mr. Sharp regarding his ability to pay, employment status, or \nother relevant factors, including the fact that Mr. Sharp was not on probation when he was \narrested, as the court originally believed.  It was not until two weeks later that the court agreed to \nreduce Plaintiff's bond, after Mr. Sharp was able to explain to the court that he was not on \nprobation at the time of his arrest and to have his employer write a letter to the court in support \nof his request for pretrial release. \n116.  The attendant consequences for spending time in jail are severe.  According to \nresearch studies conducted or cited by the U.S.  Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-35 \n\nAssistance and the Arnold Foundation, among others, whether or not a criminal defendant is held \nin pretrial custody can have a tremendous impact on the outcome of the case.  For instance, in its \nreview of outcomes for more than 150,000 defendants in Kentucky during 2009-2010, the \nArnold Foundation determined that\"[ w ]hen other relevant statistical controls are considered, \ndefendants detained until trial or case disposition are 4.44 times more likely to be sentenced to \njail and 3.32 times more likely to be sentenced to prison than defendants who are released at \nsome point pending trial.\"41 Similarly, in New York City, \"the citywide conviction rate for cases \nwith no pretrial release was 92%.  By contrast, the conviction rate for cases in which the \n42 \ndefendant was at liberty from arraignment to disposition was 50%.\"\nI 17.  Aside from the impact pre-trial detention can have on the defendant's criminal \ncase, it can also significantly affect a defendant's employment or other obligations that he/she is \nunable to fulfill while in custody.  For instance, prior to Plaintiff Tucker's arrest, he received a \ntraffic ticket, which he intended to pay prior to the due date.  Following his arrest, however, Mr. \nTucker was unable to afford bail and remained in pretrial detention for over three months. \nConsequently, Mr. Tucker failed to resolve his traffic ticket on time and had his driver's license \nsuspended while he was in custody.  If it were not for his employer's uncommon willingness to \nwrite to the court on his behalf, Plaintiff Sharp likely would have remained in jail pending trial \nand lost his job as a result.  And Plaintiff Morley remained in jail for two weeks prior to posting \nbond, despite suffering from severe injuries in connection with a serious car accident that \noccurred on the day of her arrest. \n41  Christopher T. Lowenkamp et al., Laura and John Arnold Foundation, Investigating the Impact \nofPretrial Detention on Sentencing Outcomes 10 (Nov. 2013). \n42 Mary Phillips, N.Y.C. Crim. Just. Agency, Pretrial Detention and Case Outcomes 32 (Nov. \n2007). \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-36 \n\n118.  Pre-trial detention can also serve as an inappropriate incentive to obtain a guilty \nplea in exchange for release from jail.  Such an incentive can and has been used even if a \ndefendant has not yet spoken to a lawyer and notwithstanding the person's innocence or the \navailability of viable defenses to challenge the State's case.  As noted above, Plaintiff Tucker, \nwho spent three months in jail proclaiming his innocence and hoping-in vain-for a thorough \ninvestigation of his case, recently pleaded guilty after being told that he would be released from \ncustody pending his sentencing. \nExcessive Caseloads and Workloads \n119.  In 1973, under the direction of the U.S.  Department of Justice, the National \nAdvisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals developed national caseload \nstandards for the first time.  According to NAC Standard 13.12:  \"The case load of a public \ndefender attorney should not exceed the following: felonies per attorney per year: not more than \n150; misdemeanors (excluding traffic) per attorney per year: not more than 400; juvenile court \ncases per attorney per year: not more than 200; Mental Health Act cases per attorney per year: \n43 \nnot more than 200; and appeals per attorney per year: not more than 25.\"\n43 \nIt should be noted that, in recent years, experts in the field have suggested that the NAC \nstandards are outdated and fail to account for the added complexities that have been infused into \ncriminal defense practice over the last 40 years, including the introduction of sexually violent \noffender commitment proceedings, persistent offender or \"three-strikes\" statutes, significant \ncollateral consequences resulting from convictions, and a growing recognition of the unique \nnature of juvenile defense.  As such, commentators have argued that the NAC standards are \nthemselves too high.  See Norman Lefstein, Securing Reasonable Caseloads: Ethics and Law in \nPublic Defense 43-48 (2011). \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-37 \n\n120.  The NAC standards do not contemplate a mixed caseload.  In other words, an \nattorney who handles felony cases should carry no more than 150 such cases during the course of \na year, and nothing else.44 \n121.  In August 2009, the American Bar Association released its \"Eight Guidelines of \nPublic Defense Related to Excessive Workloads\" (\"Guidelines\") in an effort to set forth a \n\"detailed action plan ... to which those providing public defense should adhere as they seek to \ncomply with their professional responsibilities.\"45  Among other things, the Guidelines include \nassessment of \"whether excessive workloads are preventing [public defenders] from fulfilling \nperformance obligations\"; supervision and monitoring of workloads; training with regard to an \nattorney's ethical duties in the face of excessive workloads; and the need for those managing the \n46 \npublic defense system to determine whether excessive workloads exist.\n122.  Due in part to these excessive case loads, and the resulting lack of time and \nresources available to public defenders, Plaintiffs were not represented at their initial \nappearances, were unable to communicate effectively with their attorneys on a consistent basis, \nand did not have their cases adequately investigated (if at all), or otherwise prepared in advance \noftrial.  Moreover, as a result of their heavy caseloads, the public defenders representing \nPlaintiffs did not have the time or support necessary to file appropriate pretrial motions with the \ncourt. \n44 \"The standards are disjunctive, so if a public defender is assigned cases from more than one \ncategory, the percentage of the maximum caseload in each should be assessed and the combined \ntotal should not exceed 100%.\" Justice Denied, Chapter 2, at 66 n.  102 (citing National Advisory \nCommission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals: Courts 276 (1973)). \n45 ABA Eight Guidelines of Public Defense Related to Excessive Workloads, 1. \n46 !d. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-38 \n\n123.  Based on recent court observations, public defenders in Kootenai, Nez Perce, \nPayette, Bannock, and Bonneville counties, among others, have so many cases assigned to them \nthat they are unable to even identify their clients until minutes before the defendants' court \nappearances. \n124.  Moreover, excessive caseloads can negatively impact the relationships between \nattorneys and their clients.  During court proceedings in Bonneville County on May 28, 2015, for \ninstance, one defendant met with his lawyer in open court, just next to and within hearing \ndistance of prosecutors, the judge, court personnel, other defendants, and members of the public \nattending court.  On information and belief, after a heated exchange between the defendant and \nhis attorney-which could be overheard throughout the courtroom-the public defender stated \nthat she had \"too many cases\" and as a result, could not \"deal with this right now.\"  On \ninformation and belief, the defendant then indicated that he wished to \"fire\" his attorney and \nrepresent himself instead.  As a result of trying to speak with his lawyer to understand his case, \nthe defendant's own attorney then summoned the marshal to escort the defendant out of the \ncourtroom. \nLack of Effective or Consistent Attorney-Client Communication \n125.  In many instances, indigent defendants in Idaho have insufficient access to their \nassigned public defenders and are unable to communicate with their attorneys for weeks or \nmonths at a time, due in large part to the extremely heavy caseloads public defenders are forced \nto handle, the lack of sufficient support staff to help attorneys manage their contacts and \nrelationships with their clients, and the fixed-fee contracts used in many counties, which provide \neconomic incentives to spend as little time as possible on any individual case.  This lack of \ncommunication makes it virtually impossible for indigent defendants, including the named \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF- 39 \n\nPlaintiffs, to understand developments in their case or to assist in their own defense in any \nmeaningful way. \n126.  Because of public defenders' heavy caseloads, lack of support, and contractual \nobligations, and the resulting lack of consistent communication between them and their clients, \nmany indigent defendants, including those who are not in custody, are unable to access the \ndiscovery materials in their cases.  Indeed, Plaintiffs Payne, Tucker, and Sharp all have been \nunable to access the discovery materials in their cases. \n127.  Because Idaho's public defenders are overextended and lack sufficient resources, \nthey often fail to receive or follow up on suggestions made by the defendant or the defendant's \nfamily with regard to possible witnesses, alibis, or other potentially exculpatory evidence.  For \ninstance, Plaintiff Morley urged her public defender to obtain a statement from a witness who \ncould provide exculpatory testimony to prove Morley's innocence.  No such statement was \nobtained by her attorney.  As a result of Ms. Morley's own efforts, however, she recently \nreceived a signed affidavit from the witness, confessing responsibility for the alleged crimes and \napologizing for the harm that she has caused Ms. Morley. \n128.  As illustrated by the named Plaintiffs' experiences, when indigent defendants-\nparticularly those in custody--do get the opportunity to speak with their attorneys, the meetings \nare usually very short and often take place in open court or other areas of the courthouse that lack \nthe privacy necessary for truly confidential and privileged discussions.  This kind of interaction \nmakes it difficult to establish a meaningful attorney-client relationship in which defendants can \nask questions and gain a clear understanding of what is happening in their case and in which \npublic defenders can answer their clients' questions thoroughly and gather all the information \nthey need to advocate effectively. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-40 \n\n129.  Plaintiffs Payne and Tucker, both of whom spent substantial time in pretrial \ndetention before being recently released, tried to contact their public defenders repeatedly while \nin custody but received no response.  Each also alleges that he met with his attorney for a total of \nless than an hour since he was arrested. \n130.  While they are not currently in custody, Plaintiffs Sharp and Morley allege that \nthey are unable to communicate effectively with their attorneys.  Specifically, both indicate that \nthat their questions and suggestions go routinely unanswered by their attorneys; and that they are \nunclear about developments in their cases, or the implications of such developments. \nLack of Investigation and Expert Analysis and Testimony \n131.  In counties across the state, having a publicly funded investigator or expert \nassigned to a case is a luxury that is most often reserved for indigent defendants charged with \nparticularly serious felonies. \n132.  Of the 34 counties that use a contract-defender model, the vast majority do not \nincrease the amount of the contract to account for the cost of investigators and experts.  Rather, \ncontract attorneys must make special requests to the court or the local county's board of \ncommissioners, on a case-by-case basis, to obtain the resources necessary to retain an \ninvestigator or expert. \n133.  On information and belief, public defenders often choose not to make such \nrequests at all, given the very limited funds available to meet them.  Indeed, Plaintiff Morley has \nbeen told that if she wanted to have an expert analyze the drug evidence in her case and be \nprepared to testify at trial, she would have to pay for it herself.  Ms. Morley is unable to pay for \nthe expert on her own, and therefore could be prevented from having expert testimony to aid in \nher defense. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-41 \n\n134.  On information and belief, all of the Plaintiffs' appointed lawyers have been \nunable to investigate Plaintiffs' cases in any meaningful way, making it difficult to prepare \ndefenses likely to succeed at trial-or in the context of plea negotiations, for that matter. \nUse of Fixed-Fee Contracts \n135.  There are currently at least 19 Idaho counties utilizing a fixed-fee contract system, \nnotwithstanding the fact that such contracts are prohibited by statute. \n136.  For instance, in Payette County, the current public-defense contract provides that \nthe County will pay the contracting attorney $560 for each \"Public Day\" that the attorney works. \nA Public Day is defined in the contract as \"any day in which CONTRACTOR must appear in \nCourt for a client he is appointed to under this Agreement, or any day in which CONTRACTOR \nworks for 5 or more hours on clients he is appointed to under this Agreement.\"  While the \ncontract goes on to state that \"[t]here is not a limit to the number of days that CONTRACTOR \nmay use as Public Days in any given month,\" the fixed daily rate creates a disincentive to spend \nany extended amount of time in court, or to spend more than the minimum five hours working on \nindigent-defense cases.  This is especially problematic given that the public defense contractors \nin Payette County are still permitted to maintain a separate private practice.  Moreover, the \ncontract states explicitly that it \"does not include any costs of transcripts, or any expenses of \ntrial, investigation or appeal for which the Court may approve expenditures.\"  In order to access \nany additional funds, the contractor must first obtain \"advance approval for such expenses from \nthe district judge or magistrate having jurisdiction over the case.\" \n137.  Upon information and belief, the 2010-2011 public-defense contract in Gem \nCounty, which is the most recent contract to be made publically available by the County, \nprovides that the County \"shall pay the sum of One Hundred Eighty Thousand Dollars \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-42 \n\n($180,000) for Public Defense services\" during the contract period, and that that sum is to be \npaid in twelve installments of $15,000 each.  In the event that an indigent defendant in Gem \nCounty is charged with a \"special-circumstance offense\" (i.e. murder), the contracting attorney \nmust negotiate with the County for certain \"extraordinary expenses,\" such as \"psychological \nevaluation and expert testimony, ballistics and forensic scientific testing and expert testimony, \nchange of venue expenses, and conflict-of-interest attorneys.\"  It appears that, for all other \nalleged crimes, such expenses would have to be taken out of the fixed $180,000 fee, along with \nall expenses associated with salaries, insurance, equipment, and office space. \n138.  The fixed-fee contract system in Gem County may also explain a disturbing \noccurrence during court proceedings held on May 27,2015, during which the public defender \nappeared to ignore a clear conflict of interest.  The case in question involved co-defendants-one \nadult, one juvenile-charged with various drug crimes.  While the two defendants were \nrepresented by different attorneys, upon information and belief, both lawyers work in the office \nof the contracting attorney.  This was particularly notewotihy since one of the defendants had \nalready pleaded guilty, while the other considered whether or not to do the same.  Indeed, at \nvarious points during the proceeding, both defendants and both attorneys were present in the \ncourtroom while their individual circumstances were discussed.  Since the Gem County \ncontract-like most other fixed-fee contracts in Idaho-requires the public defender to pay for \nconflict counsel out of the lump sum payment they receive from the county, there is a powerful \ndisincentive to ignore or attempt to work around clear conflicts of interest. \n139.  In Custer County, the current public-defender contract states that the contracting \nattorney shall receive an annual sum of $50,000 for services rendered, and an additional $65.00 \nper hour for any time spent on indigent defense cases exceeding 50 hours in any given month. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-43 \n\nHowever, upon information and belief, the current Custer County public defender is based in \nBlackfoot, Idaho, approximately two hours from the county seat in Challis.  Nevertheless, the \ncontract states that \"the Attorney shall not charge Custer County for the travel expenses.\" \n140.  Fixed-fee contracts create a serious conflict of interest for defending attorneys \nbecause they encourage the attorney to spend as little money and time as possible on each case in \norder to maximize the amount of money and time that can be used to cover other cases, and other \nexpenses, including compensation for the contracting attorney and any staff to assist with \nrepresentation. \n141.  To make matters worse, upon information and belief, at least 26 of the 34 counties \noperating on a contract system permit public defenders to maintain a private legal practice. \nIndeed, the Franklin County public defense contract states explicitly that \"[a]ttorneys providing \nservices under this Agreement may undertake representation of person charged with a crime in \nthis or any other jurisdiction for a fee.\" \n142.  Plaintiff Payne was arrested and charged in Payette County and was assigned a \npublic defender.  Due, in part, to the fixed-fee contract in effect in Payette County, the \ncontracting attorney who represented Plaintiff Payne had limited incentive to spend the money \nand time necessary to locate and interview witnesses, secure expert testimony, or otherwise \nexplore ways of challenging the criminal charges at issue.  Indeed, the defender had substantial \nincentive not to engage in any defense activity or strategy that is not absolutely required. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-44 \n\nLack ofI ndependence \n143.  The first ofthe American Bar Association's (\"ABA\") Ten Principles is to ensure \nthat \"the public defense function, including the selection, funding, and payment of defense \ncounsel, is independent.\"47 \n144.  In many counties, the local board of commissioners retains the authority to hire \nand fire the public defender at will, even though few, if any, of the commissioners has any \nexperience working as attorneys, let alone supervising attorneys. \n145.  The board of commissioners also typically controls the amount of funding that \nwill be extended to the public defender, and in some cases, will make the final decision as to \nwhether a request for an investigator or expert will be approved. \n146.  Upon information and belief, at least 17 counties require public defenders to \nrequest additional resources from either the court or the county commissioners to pay for an \ninvestigator or an expert in a given case. \n14 7.  Upon information and belief, at least 10 counties require public defenders to \nrequest additional resources from either the court or the county commissioners to pay for \nlaboratory testing. \n148.  Given the vast authority that boards of county commissioners maintain over \npublic defenders and the day-to-day operations of the public-defender office, there is a real fear \nof retribution among public defenders.  On information and belief, public defenders working in \ninstitutional offices, as well as those working under contract, are concerned that they will lose \ntheir jobs or contracts, or be otherwise disciplined, if they run afoul of the commissioners' \n47 ABA Ten Principles of A Public Defense Delivery System no. I, available at \nhttp:// www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/adm inistrative/legal_a id_ indigent_ defendants/Is_ s \nclaid _ def_t enprinciplesbooklet.authcheckdam. pdf. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-45 \n\nexpectations.  As a result, many of Idaho's public defenders are beholden to their commissioners \nand therefore lack the independence necessary to do their jobs effectively. \n149.  Indeed, Defendant Otter recently approved, and the State of Idaho enacted, \nchanges to Idaho's indigent-defense statutes that removed a two-year-minimum term \nrequirement for public defenders in institutional offices.  Removing the two-year-minimum term \nrequirement severely undercuts any independence those public defenders might hope to have, as \nit leaves them vulnerable at any time to termination for no reason or for unjustified reasons. The \nremoval of the minimum term requirement was done over the expressed objection of public \ndefenders. \n150.  The State's failure to set standards regarding the commissioners' ability to hire \nand fire public defenders without justification results in, among other things, less zealous \nadvocacy on the part of the defending attorneys, including a reticence to seek supplemental \nfunding for investigators, experts, or other necessary resources. \nLack of Sufficient Supervision and Evaluation \n151.  While independence is essential, the last ofthe ABA Ten Principles also requires \nthat public defenders be \"supervised and systematically reviewed for quality and efficiency \naccording to nationally and locally adopted standards.\"  ABA Ten Principles, no. 10. \n152.  The State currently plays no role whatsoever-either by way of directly \nsupervising or setting guiding principles regarding the same-in supervising or evaluating the \nwork done by public-defense offices and contractors in the various counties. \n153.  The limited supervision that does exist is often deficient since it is carried out by \nlocal county commissioners with little or no experience overseeing the work of an attorney. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-46 \n\n154.  Moreover, because the State has not established uniform performance standards, \nthere is very little reliable data available for managers to evaluate the work of the attorneys they \noversee, whether it be related to overall workloads, the extent and nature of client contact, \nmotion practice, adequacy of investigation, or level of preparation for hearings and trials. \nHarm to Plaintiffs \n155.  All ofthe above-mentioned issues have combined to cause tremendous harm to · \nPlaintiffs and to the Class as a whole. \nPlaintif!Tracv Tucker \n156.  Plaintiff Tracy Tucker was not represented by counsel at his initial appearance, \nresulting in his inability to make any arguments as to the amount of his bail, which was \nultimately set by the court at $40,000.  Because he was not able to afford bail, Mr. Tucker \nremained in jail for three months pending the resolution of his case. Throughout the duration of \nhis case, Mr. Tucker has been unable to communicate effectively or consistently with his public \ndefender, making it virtually impossible for him to participate in the development of his defense. \nIn addition, Mr. Tucker's attorney was unable to conduct any meaningful investigation into his \ncase, review the relevant discovery with his client, or share with Mr. Tucker his thoughts with \nregard to trial strategy and related matters.  Mr. Tucker ultimately pleaded guilty after spending \nthree months in jail.  He is scheduled for sentencing on August 3, 2015. \nPlaintif!Jason Sharp \n157.  Plaintiff Jason Sharp was not represented by counsel at his initial appearance, \nresulting in his inability to make any arguments as to the amount of his bail, which was \noriginally set by the court at $50,000.  Since Mr. Sharp could not afford to post bail, he remained \nin the Shoshone County Jail for approximately two weeks until, without the help of his lawyer, \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-47 \n\nMr. Sharp was able to convince the court that his bail amount was inappropriate given the \ncircumstances of his case.  He was subsequently released pending trial.  Throughout the duration \nof his case, however, Mr. Sharp has been unable to communicate effectively or consistently with \nhis public defender, making it vit1ually impossible for him to pat1icipate in the development of \nhis defense.  In addition, Mr. Sharp's attorney was unable to conduct any meaningful \ninvestigation into his case, review the relevant discovery with his client, or share with Mr. Sharp \nhis thoughts with regard to trial strategy and related matters.  Mr. Sharp is scheduled to go to trial \non July 14, 20 I 5, and faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted on both counts. \nPlaintif!Naomi Morley \n158.  Although counsel from the Ada County Public Defender's office was present with \nPlaintiffNaomi Morley at her initial appearance, Ms. Morley had no opportunity to consult with \nthat lawyer at that time, resulting in her inability to make any arguments as to the amount of her \nbail, which was ultimately set by the cout1 at $15,000.  In any event, that office soon after \ndetermined it could not represent Ms. Morley due to a conflict of interest.  Because she was not \nable to afford bail, Ms. Morley remained in jail for two weeks before having her bail reduced and \nposting bond-all while recovering from serious injuries sustained in a car accident on the day of \nher arrest.  Throughout the duration of her case, Ms. Morley has been unable to communicate \neffectively or consistently with her public defender, making it virtually impossible for her to \nparticipate, in any meaningful way, in the development of her defense.  In addition, Ms. \nMorley's attorney has been unable to conduct any meaningful investigation into her case, review \nthe relevant discovery with his client, or share with Ms. Morley his thoughts with regard to trial \nstrategy and related matters.  Ms. Morley is scheduled to go to trial on June 29,2015, and faces \nmore than 15 years in prison if convicted. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-48 \n\nPlaintiff Jeremy Payne \n159.  Plaintiff Jeremy Payne was not represented by counsel at his initial appearance, \nresulting in his inability to make any arguments as to the amount of his bail, which was \nultimately set by the court at $30,000.  Because he was not able to afford bail, Mr. Payne has \nremained in jail pending resolution of his case.  Throughout the duration of his case, Mr. Payne \nhas been unable to communicate effectively or consistently with his public defender, making it \nvirtually impossible for him to participate, in any meaningful way, in the development of his \ndefense.  In addition, Mr. Payne's attorney has been unable to conduct any meaningful \ninvestigation into his case, review the relevant discovery with his client, or share with Mr. Payne \nhis thoughts with regard to trial strategy and related matters.  Mr. Payne is scheduled to go to \ntrial on July 21,2015, and faces up to seven years in prison if convicted. \n160.  The State of Idaho has not provided Plaintiffs, or those similarly situated, with the \nrepresentation to which they are constitutionally and otherwise legally entitled.  They have not \nbeen provided with adequate representation at every critical stage; have not had sufficient \noppottunity to discuss their cases with their attorneys, to patticipate in building a defense against \nthe charges they face, or to make informed decisions about the disposition of their cases.  Upon \ninformation and belief, the State of Idaho will continue to fail to provide Plaintiffs with the \nrepresentation to which they are entitled. \n161.  The representation provided to Plaintiffs is illustrative of the patterns of \nrepresentation provided to indigent defendants throughout the State of Idaho and results from the \nstructural and systemic failings that were identified in the 2010 NLADA Report and subsequent \nstudies carried out over the last five years. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-49 \n\nState Liability \n162.  The United States Supreme Court has made clear that pursuant to the Sixth \nAmendment to the U.S.  Constitution, it is the states' constitutional duty to provide for the \neffective assistance of counsel for criminal defendants who are unable to afford an attorney. \n163.  The State of Idaho has failed to provide any significant funding to support the \nprovision of indigent defense services across the state. \n164.  The State of Idaho has failed to provide any supervision over the provision of \nindigent defense services across the state. \n165.  The State ofldaho has failed to establish or adopt any consistent, statewide \ncaseload standards for public defenders in the state. \n166.  The State of Idaho has failed to establish or adopt any consistent, statewide \nperformance standards for public defenders in this state. \n167.  In light of theN LADA' s 20 l 0 report, the ongoing work of the CJC and other \ncommittees tasked with studying indigent defense issues in Idaho, and the amendments to the \npublic defense statutes in 2014, the State of Idaho has been on notice for more than half a decade \nthat its public-defender system is failing to provide constitutionally sufficient representation. \n168.  Despite being on notice of the many failings of Idaho's indigent defense system, \nthe State has failed to take sufficient action to remedy the deficiencies. \n169.  The State's failure to take sufficient steps to remedy the deficiencies of Idaho's \nindigent defense system is the proximate cause of the harm suffered by indigent criminal \ndefendants throughout Idaho-including the named Plaintiffs and the Class they represent. \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF-50 \n\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nFirst Claim for Relief \nViolation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n(All Plaintiffs and the Class against All Defendants) \n170.

Appellants filed a class action complaint in which they alleged Idaho’s public defense \nsystem is inadequate under federal and state constitutional standards. The district court reasoned \nthat Appellants’ claims were not justiciable on standing, ripeness, and separation of powers \ngrounds and dismissed the complaint. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. \nI.  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nAppellants  constitute  a  putative  class  of  criminal  defendants  who  seek  to  challenge \nIdaho’s public defense system. They filed a class action complaint on June 17, 2015. Appellants \nallege Idaho’s public defense system violates the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution and Article I, Section 13 of the Idaho Constitution. As defendants, Appellants \nnamed (1) the State of Idaho; (2) Governor C.L. “Butch” Otter, in his official capacity; and (3) \nthe seven members of the Idaho Public Defense Commission (PDC), in their official capacities.1 \nAppellants seek various forms of equitable relief, including a declaration that Idaho’s public \ndefense system is unconstitutional and an injunction requiring Respondents to bring Idaho’s \npublic defense system into constitutional compliance.  \nRespondents  moved  to  dismiss  the  complaint,  arguing  the  case  was  not  justiciable \nbecause Appellants did not sue the proper defendants. Since the provision of public defense has \nbeen delegated to Idaho’s forty-four counties under Idaho Code section 19-859, Respondents \nmaintained that Appellants erred by not suing the counties. Appellants countered that the State is \nultimately responsible for ensuring constitutionally adequate public defense, contending they had \nsued the proper defendants.  \nThe district court held that Appellants’ claims were not justiciable and dismissed their \ncomplaint on standing, ripeness, and separation of powers grounds. This appeal timely followed. \nII.  ISSUES ON APPEAL \n1.  Is the State of Idaho immune from state law claims alleging constitutional violations? \n2.  Do the justiciability doctrines bar this lawsuit? \n3.  Are Appellants entitled to attorney fees on appeal?  \nIII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n  “Jurisdictional issues, like standing, are questions of law, over which this Court exercises \nfree review.” In re Jerome Cnty. Bd. of Comm’rs, 153 Idaho 298, 308, 281 P.3d 1076, 1086 \n                                                 \n1 These three entities are collectively referred to as Respondents.  \n2 \n\n(2012). Similarly, this Court has free review over whether dismissal for lack of jurisdiction was \nproperly granted. See Meisner v. Potlatch Corp., 131 Idaho 258, 260, 954 P.2d 676, 678 (1998).  \nIV.  ANALYSIS \nWe first address the two main bases of the district court’s dismissal order: immunity, and \nthe justiciability doctrines. We then address whether Appellants should receive attorney fees on \nappeal.   \nA.  Is  the  State  of  Idaho  immune  from  state  law  claims  alleging  constitutional \nviolations? \nAppellants sued (1) the State of Idaho; (2) Governor C.L. “Butch” Otter, in his official \ncapacity; and (3) the seven members of the Idaho Public Defense Commission (PDC), in their \nofficial  capacities.  Against  each  defendant,  Appellants  alleged  claims  under  the  Sixth  and \nFourteenth  Amendments  to  the  U.S.  Constitution  and  Article  I,  Section  13  of  the  Idaho \nConstitution. Concerning immunity, the district court held that the State was immune from the \nfederal law claims alleged, but not the state law claims. The district court further held that neither \nGovernor Otter nor the PDC have immunity. The only immunity issue before us on appeal is \nwhether the State is immune from Appellants’ state law claims alleging constitutional violations.   \nRespondents set forth two bases to contend the State is immune. First, they contend Idaho \nRule of Civil Procedure 3(b) shields the State from claims under state law for injunctive relief. In \nrelevant  part,  when  the  complaint  was  filed,  Rule  3(b),  entitled  “Designation  of  Parties,” \nprovided:  \n[A]ll civil actions by or against a governmental unit or agency, or corporation, \nshall  designate  such  party  in  its  governmental  or  corporate  name  only,  and \nindividuals constituting the governing boards of governmental units . . . shall not \nbe designated as parties in any capacity unless the action is brought against them \nindividually or for relief under Rules 65 or 74. \nI.R.C.P. 3(b) (2015).2 \n  Respondents bolster their argument with Weyyakin Ranch Property Owners’ Association, \nInc. v. City of Ketchum, 127 Idaho 1, 1–3, 896 P.2d 327, 327–29 (1995). In Weyyakin, the \nplaintiff sued the City of Ketchum, seeking to enjoin enforcement of a subdivision annexation \nordinance.  Id.  The  plaintiff  obtained  a  temporary  restraining  order  (TRO)  enjoining  the \nordinance. Id. When the City of Ketchum, through its elected officials, failed to comply with the \n                                                 \n2 Effective July 1, 2016, this rule no longer exists. The only “Designation of Parties” rule that currently exists is \nRule 3(c), which provides: “Any filing party must be designated as the plaintiff or petitioner, and any party against \nwhom the same is filed must be designated as the defendant or respondent.”  \n3 \n\nTRO, the district court held the officials in contempt. Id. On appeal, this Court held that the \ndistrict court’s contempt order violated Rule 3(b) because the complaint named the “City of \nKetchum,” not the “elected officials individually.” Id. at 3, 896 P.2d at 329. \n  Respondents’ argument is unavailing. Nothing in the plain language of Rule 3(b) shields \nthe  State  from  claims  under  state  law  for  injunctive  relief.  Nor  does  Weyyakin  support \nRespondents’ argument. Weyyakin merely held that the district court erred by holding the elected \nofficials in contempt because they were not named in the complaint “individually or for relief \nunder  Rules  65  or  74,”  as  Rule  3(b)  required.  Id.  As  a  result,  “[b]ecause  the  temporary \nrestraining orders failed to name the elected officials individually, the trial court never obtained \njurisdiction over them, and therefore did not have the authority to find them in contempt.” Id. \nNothing similar is at issue in this case.  \nSecond, Respondents argue the doctrine of sovereign immunity shields the State from \nAppellants’ state law claims alleging constitutional violations. “It is the general rule that, under \nthe doctrine of sovereign immunity, a governmental unit can only be sued upon its consent.” Bott \nv. Idaho State Bldg. Auth., 128 Idaho 580, 591, 917 P.2d 737, 748 (1996). Even so, many other \njurisdictions hold that sovereign immunity does not apply when constitutional violations are \nalleged, as a contrary rule would render constitutional rights meaningless. See, e.g., Columbia \nAir Servs., Inc. v. Conn. Dep’t of Transp., 977 A.2d 636, 645 (Conn. 2009); Fla. Dep’t of \nRevenue v. Kuhnlein, 646 So. 2d 717, 721 (Fla. 1994); Corum v. Univ. of N.C. Through Bd. of \nGovernors, 413 S.E.2d 276, 292 (N.C. 1992); Ashton v. Brown, 660 A.2d 447, 463 (Md. Ct. \nApp. 1995); Kilgo v. Ga. Dep’t of Corrs., 413 S.E.2d 507, 508 (Ga. Ct. App. 1991). \nThough we have never addressed the issue, we have recognized that because sovereign \nimmunity is a common law doctrine, the judiciary has the power to modify it. Haeg v. City of \nPocatello, 98 Idaho 315, 317, 563 P.2d 39, 41 (1977). Were we to accept Respondents’ position \nthat sovereign immunity shields the State from suit in this instance, we would leave parties \nunable to vindicate constitutional rights against the State. This we decline to do. Accordingly, \naligning  with  our  sister  jurisdictions  identified  above,  we  hold  that  sovereign  immunity  is \ninapplicable when constitutional violations are alleged.  \nB.  Do the justiciability doctrines bar this lawsuit? \nThe justiciability doctrines are the second basis of the district court’s dismissal order. The \njusticiability doctrines “identify appropriate or suitable occasions for adjudication by a court.” \n4 \n\nState v. Philip Morris, Inc., 158 Idaho 874, 881, 354 P.3d 187, 194 (2015). Before reviewing the \ndistrict court’s justiciability analysis, we take a moment to clarify which standard of review \nshould be employed when justiciability challenges are made. We note that the district court \napplied Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Rule 12(b)(6) governs dismissal for failure to \nstate  a  claim,  inquiring  into  the  factual  sufficiency  of  the  substantive  claims  alleged.  The \njusticiability doctrines,  however, are wholly dissimilar from whether a substantive claim is \nadequately alleged. Indeed, the justiciability doctrines implicate jurisdiction. E.g., Martin v. \nCamas Cnty. ex rel. Bd. of Comm’rs, 150 Idaho 508, 512, 248 P.3d 1243, 1247 (2011). \nAs such, we pronounce that justiciability challenges are subject to Idaho Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(1) since they implicate jurisdiction.3 This, in turn, gives rise to a different \nstandard of review than the one which Rule 12(b)(6) supplies. See Owsley v. Idaho Indus. \nComm’n, 141 Idaho 129, 133 n.1, 106 P.3d 455, 459 n.1 (2005). The district court’s error in this \nregard, however, does not constitute grounds for reversal. For one, our earlier cases left the issue \nunsettled. Compare Martin, 150 Idaho at 512, 248 P.3d at 1247 (“Where a plaintiff does not have \nstanding it cannot be said that the ‘case or controversy’ requirement has been satisfied; therefore \nthe judiciary lacks jurisdiction to hear the case.”), with Brooksby v. Geico Gen. Ins. Co., 153 \nIdaho 546, 547–48, 286 P.3d 182, 183–84 (2012) (addressing standing under Rule 12(b)(6)). \nMoreover, Appellants did not raise the issue in their opening brief. See Gallagher v. State, 141 \nIdaho 665, 669, 115 P.3d 756, 760 (2005) (explaining that issues not raised in the opening brief \nare waived). Thus, although we clarify which standard of review governs, we disregard the error. \nSee I.R.C.P. 61 (“At every stage of the proceeding, the court must disregard all errors and defects \nthat do not affect any party’s substantial rights.”). \nAligning our focus back to the present case, the district court’s order addressed three \njusticiability doctrines: (1) standing; (2) ripeness; and (3) separation of powers.4 \n                                                 \n3 The same is true in federal court, which results in justiciability challenges being reviewed under Rule 12(b)(1). \nE.g., Maya v. Centex Corp., 658 F.3d 1060, 1067 (9th Cir. 2011) (“The district court erroneously concluded that \nlack of Article III standing was grounds for dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to \nstate a claim.”). And, as we explained previously, “Idaho has adopted the federal justiciability requirement.” Noh v. \nCenarrusa, 137 Idaho 798, 801, 53 P.3d 1217, 1220 (2002). \n4 Appellants note that standing and ripeness were “never raised, briefed, or argued by either side,” yet the district \ncourt addressed the doctrines. Even so, the justiciability doctrines can be raised sua sponte at any time. See, e.g., \nCampbell v. Parkway Surgery Ctr., LLC, 158 Idaho 957, 962, 354 P.3d 1172, 1177 (2015) (“[T]his Court has a duty \nto raise the issue of standing sua sponte.”); Thomas v. City of N.Y., 143 F.3d 31, 34 (2d Cir. 1998) (explaining that \nbecause the “ ‘ripeness doctrine is drawn both from Article III limitations on judicial power and from prudential \n5 \n\n1.  Standing \nIn a class action, standing is met if at least one named plaintiff satisfies the requirements \nof standing against every named defendant. Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, 978 \n(9th Cir. 2011); Henry v. Circus Circus Casinos, Inc., 223 F.R.D. 541, 544 (D. Nev. 2004). In \norder to have standing to seek injunctive relief, a plaintiff must demonstrate a likelihood of \nrepeated injury or future harm to the plaintiff in the absence of the injunction. See City of Los \nAngeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 102–03 (1983). \nAppellants argue they have standing under the traditional and “relaxed” analyses. Both \nare discussed below. \n(a)  The traditional standing analysis \nUnder the traditional standing analysis, “the plaintiff must show (1) an ‘injury in fact,’ (2) \na sufficient ‘causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of,’ and (3) a \n‘like[lihood]’ that the injury ‘will be redressed by a favorable decision.’ ” Philip Morris, 158 \nIdaho at 881, 354 P.3d at 194 (citation omitted).  \n    (i)  Injury in fact \nInjury in fact requires the injury to “be ‘concrete and particularized’ and ‘actual or \nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.’ ” Id. (citation omitted). The district court concluded \nAppellants’ allegations did not satisfy this standard, emphasizing how Appellants had not been \nconvicted or sentenced, nor had they pursued any appeal or post-conviction relief.  \nThe district court erred on two primary bases. First, the district court erred factually by \nconcluding no Appellant had been convicted. The complaint alleged Tucker had pled guilty and \nwas awaiting sentencing. An affidavit filed with the complaint set forth the same information.  \nSecond, the district court erred by attempting to undertake case-by-case inquiries into \nAppellants’ individual criminal cases. The district court treated Appellants’ allegations as subject \nto Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687–88 (1984), which contemplates case-by-case \nanalyses  of  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel  claims  by  inquiring  whether  (1)  counsel’s \nperformance was deficient; and (2) counsel’s deficiency prejudiced the defendant. Strickland \nauthorizes  relief  in  individual  criminal  cases  by,  for  example,  allowing  courts  to  vacate \nconvictions due to counsel’s ineffective assistance. The Court in Strickland was very clear about \n                                                                                                                                                             \nreasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction,’ the court can raise it sua sponte, and, indeed, can do so for the first \ntime on appeal.” (citation omitted)). \n6 \n\nthe  individualized  analysis  it  was  creating.  Id.  at  690  (“Thus,  a  court  deciding  an  actual \nineffectiveness claim must judge the reasonableness of counsel’s challenged conduct on the facts \nof the particular case, viewed as of the time of counsel’s conduct.”). Strickland, therefore, is \ninapplicable when systemic deficiencies in the provision of public defense are at issue. E.g., \nKuren v. Luzerne Cty., 146 A.3d 715, 746–47 (Pa. 2016); Hurrell-Harring v. New York, 930 \nN.E.2d 217, 221–22 (N.Y. Ct. App. 2010). \nThe issues raised in this case do not implicate Strickland. Appellants alleged systemic, \nstatewide deficiencies plaguing Idaho’s public defense system. Appellants seek to vindicate their \nfundamental right to constitutionally adequate public defense at the State’s expense, as required \nunder the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and Article I, Section 13 of the Idaho \nConstitution. They have not asked for any relief in their individual criminal cases. Rather, they \nseek to effect systemic reform. Their allegations find support in both Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 \nU.S. 335, 342 (1963), and State v. Montroy, 37 Idaho 684, 690, 217 P. 611, 614 (1923), which \nmake clear that it is the State’s obligation to provide constitutionally adequate public defense at \ncritical stages of the prosecution. Alleging systemic inadequacies in a public defense system \nresults in actual or constructive denials of counsel at critical stages of the prosecution suffices to \nshow an injury in fact to establish standing in a suit for deprivation of constitutional rights. Cf. \nLuckey v. Harris, 860 F.2d 1012, 1016–17 (11th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 957 (1990). \nAs  a  result,  we  conclude  Appellants  satisfy  the  injury  in  fact  standard  because  the \ncomplaint alleged actual and constructive denials of counsel at critical stages of the prosecution. \nA criminal defendant who is entitled to counsel but goes unrepresented at a critical stage of \nprosecution suffers an actual denial of counsel and is entitled to a presumption of prejudice. See \nUnited States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 658–60 (1984). As to allegations of actual denials of \ncounsel, Tracy Tucker, Jason Sharp, and Jeremy Payne were not represented by counsel at their \ninitial appearances. During the initial appearances, bail was set. Since Tucker, Sharp, and Payne \ncould not afford to post bail, they remained in jail for varying lengths of time—three months for \nTucker; two weeks for Sharp; and five months for Payne. These allegations illustrate violations \nof constitutional and statutory requirements. See I.C. § 19-852(1)(a); Rothgery v. Gillespie Cnty., \nTex., 554 U.S. 191, 194 (2008) (“This Court has held that the right to counsel guaranteed by the \nSixth Amendment applies at the first appearance before a judicial officer at which a defendant is \ntold of the formal accusation against him and restrictions are imposed on his liberty.”). \n7 \n\nThe complaint also alleged constructive denials of counsel. A constructive denial of \ncounsel  occurs  when  “although  counsel  is  available  to  assist  the  accused  during  trial,  the \nlikelihood that any lawyer, even a fully competent one, could provide effective assistance is so \nsmall that a presumption of prejudice is appropriate without inquiry into the actual conduct of the \ntrial.” Ramsey v. State, 159 Idaho 887, 891, 367 P.3d 711, 715 (Ct. App. 2015) (citing Cronic, \n466 U.S. at 659–60). Naomi Morley, though represented by counsel via counsel’s video presence \nat the initial appearance, had no opportunity to speak with counsel during her initial appearance. \nAs to Morley, the complaint further alleged the following additional constructive denials: \nOn information and belief, Ms. Morley’s lawyer’s caseload has been so large, and \nhis resources so few, that he has been unable to review Ms. Morley’s extensive \ncomments on the police reports in her case or to investigate the vehicle involved \nin the accident before the state scrapped it, destroying that evidence. Further, Ms. \nMorley  has  been  unable  to  communicate  effectively  or  consistently  with  her \nattorney, and is concerned that her attorney is pressuring her to plead guilty \nbecause he does not have the time or resources to prepare sufficiently for trial. \nAs to Tracy Tucker, the complaint alleged the following constructive denials: \nAs of 10 days prior to Mr. Tucker’s trial date, his attorney’s demanding schedule \nhad  prevented  him  from  conducting  any  meaningful  investigation  into  Mr. \nTucker’s case, reviewing and explaining to Mr. Tucker the relevant discovery \nmaterials, or discussing trial strategy with Mr. Tucker. On June 2, 2015, Mr. \nTucker pleaded guilty to attempted strangulation, at which time he was released \nfrom jail. Mr. Tucker is scheduled to be sentenced on August 3, 2015, and faces \nup to 15 years in prison. \nAs to Jason Sharp, the complaint alleged the following constructive denials: \nMr. Sharp has been unable to communicate effectively with his attorney regarding \nthe status of his case. For instance, despite repeated requests from Mr. Sharp, his \nattorney has not yet provided him with a copy of the discovery materials in his \ncase, leaving Mr. Sharp unclear about what evidence the State does or does not \nhave  against  him,  and  making  it  impossible  for  Mr.  Sharp  to  participate \nmeaningfully in the development of his defense. Moreover, aside from several \nmotions  to  continue  his  jury  trial,  Mr.  Sharp’s  attorney  has  not  filed  any \nsubstantive motions on his behalf. \nAs to Jeremy Payne, the complaint alleged the following constructive denials:  \nUnfortunately, during the five months he was in custody, Mr. Payne was unable to \ncommunicate with his attorney on a consistent basis. In light of the many other \nfelony cases assigned to his attorney, Mr. Payne only met with counsel twice at \nthe County Jail, both for very short periods of time. Aside from those brief \nmeetings, Mr. Payne has only met with his attorney in court—for even shorter \nperiods of time—just prior to his court appearances, and has been unable to \ncontact his attorney by phone despite repeated attempts. Indeed, Mr. Payne has \n8 \n\nspent a total of approximately 30–45 minutes with his attorney since the inception \nof his case. Moreover, to date, Mr. Payne’s attorney has been unable to conduct \nany meaningful investigation into his case, review the relevant discovery with his \nclient, or share with Mr. Payne his thoughts with regard to trial strategy and \nrelated matters. \n  Recognizing that our analysis at this juncture is simply whether Appellants have alleged \ninjuries that are “concrete and particularized” and “actual or imminent,” we conclude the above \nallegations meet the injury in fact standard.  \n    (ii)  Causation \nCausation requires the injury to be “fairly traceable to the challenged action of the \ndefendant, and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.” \nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 167 (1997). The district court reasoned that causation could not \nbe shown, emphasizing that the Legislature and the counties “are the principal bodies with the \npower to affect [sic] the policy (political) and systemic changes Plaintiffs seek.” The district \ncourt,  however,  did  not  conduct  separate  causation  analyses  as  to  each  defendant.  Since \ncausation looks at the conduct of each particular defendant, we analyze each separately. \n      (1)  State of Idaho \nConcerning the State, Appellants satisfy the causation standard. The right to counsel is \n“made obligatory upon the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.” Gideon, 372 U.S. at 342 \n(emphasis added); see also Montroy, 37 Idaho at 690, 217 P. at 614. The State, therefore, has \nultimate responsibility to ensure that the public defense system passes constitutional muster. \nWhile the provision of public defense has been delegated to Idaho’s forty-four counties under \nIdaho Code section 19-859, “the ultimate responsibility for fulfilling the . . . constitutional duty \ncannot be delegated.” See Osmunson v. State, 135 Idaho 292, 296, 17 P.3d 236, 240 (2000) \n(explaining that the Legislature could delegate provision of public education to school districts, \nalthough it could not delegate the ultimate responsibility of fulfilling constitutional duties). \nMoreover, it cannot be said that the counties are third parties acting independently of the State \nwith respect to public defense. Instead, the counties are political subdivisions of the State. See, \ne.g., Idaho Const. art. XVIII, § 1; State v. Peterson, 61 Idaho 50, 54, 97 P.2d 603, 605 (1939). \nBecause Appellants’ alleged injuries are fairly traceable to the State, we hold that causation as to \nthe State is met.  \n \n \n9 \n\n      (2)  Governor Otter \nUnlike the State, the causal chain linking Appellants’ injuries to Governor Otter is too \nattenuated for two primary reasons. First, as the district court reasoned, the provision of public \ndefense has been delegated to Idaho’s forty-four counties. I.C. § 19-859. Appellants cite to no \nauthority  suggesting  that  the  counties  are  beholden  to  Governor  Otter  with  respect  to  the \nprovision of public defense. The counties therefore act independently of Governor Otter, which \nmilitates against causation as to him. Bennett, 520 U.S. at 167 (stating that causation means the \ninjury cannot be “the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.”). \nSimilarly, although Governor Otter appoints four of the seven PDC members, nothing suggests \nthe PDC members—even those he appoints—are beholden to Governor Otter in any way. See \nI.C. § 19-849(1)(c). Instead, the PDC is a self-governing agency. I.C. § 19-849(1). \nEqually unavailing is Appellants’ position that Governor Otter is somehow responsible \nfor preventing and remedying alleged statewide violations of the right to counsel. The complaint \nalleges, “[a]s the chief executive of the state, Governor Otter bears ultimate responsibility for the \nprovision of constitutionally mandated services to the people of Idaho.” Indeed, Governor Otter \nhas the “supreme executive power” and is therefore required to “see that the laws are faithfully \nexecuted.” See Idaho Const. art. IV, § 5. Even so, the weight of authority demonstrates that a \ngeneral  duty  to  enforce  state  laws  is  not  sufficient  to  establish  a  causal  connection.  E.g., \nWomen’s  Emer.  Network  v.  Bush,  323  F.3d  937,  949–50  (11th  Cir.  2003)  (“Where  the \nenforcement power is the responsibility of parties other than the governor . . . the governor’s \ngeneral executive power is insufficient to confer jurisdiction.”); Long v. Van de Kamp, 961 F.2d \n151, 152 (9th Cir. 1992). \nAttempting to establish a causal nexus with Governor Otter, Appellants cite to Kitchen v. \nHerbert, 755 F.3d 1193 (10th Cir. 2014). In Kitchen, the plaintiffs challenged Utah’s ban on \nsame-sex marriage, suing the governor, the attorney general, and the county clerk. Id. at 1200–\n01. Only county clerks could issue marriage licenses. Id. County clerks’ duty to issue marriage \nlicenses was “purely ministerial,” and the State of Utah controlled the content of the marriage \napplication form. Id. at 1202 n.1. Although county clerks issued marriage licenses, the Tenth \nCircuit found a causal nexus with the governor, reasoning as follows: \nThe Governor and Attorney General have explicitly taken the position in this \nlitigation that they “have ample authority to ensure that” the Salt Lake County \nClerk “return[s] to her former practice of limiting marriage licenses to man-\n10 \n\nwoman couples in compliance with Utah law.” This assertion is supported by the \nUtah Code. The Governor is statutorily charged with “supervis[ing] the official \nconduct of all executive and ministerial officers” and “see[ing] that all offices are \nfilled and the duties thereof performed.” § 67-1-1(1) & (2). In addition, he “may \nrequire the attorney general to aid any county attorney or district attorney in the \ndischarge of his duties.” § 67-1-1(7). \nId. at 1202 (emphasis added).  \nSimilar to Kitchen, Governor Otter has authority to (1) “supervise the official conduct of \nall executive and ministerial officers”; and (2) “see that all offices are filled, and the duties \nthereof performed, or, in default thereof, apply such remedy as the law allows; and if the remedy \nis imperfect, acquaint the legislature therewith at its next session.” I.C. §§ 67-802(1), -802(2). \nHowever, those duties are discretionary. As Idaho Code section 67-802 states, “the governor has \nth[ose] powers, and may perform th[ose] duties . . . .” (emphasis added). Whereas the statute in \nKitchen  mandated  certain  executive  actions,  here  the  statute  simply  grants  Governor  Otter \ndiscretionary power. Compare U.C. § 67-1-1, with I.C. § 67-802. And, unlike county clerks’ \n“purely ministerial” duty in Kitchen, here the counties are left with significant discretion in \nfashioning the provision of public defense services. See I.C. § 19-859. Thus, Kitchen does not \nestablish a causal nexus with Governor Otter. \n Appellants cite also to Los Angeles County Bar Association v. Eu, 979 F.2d 697 (9th Cir. \n1992). The plaintiff in Eu challenged the constitutionality of a statute prescribing the number of \njudges on the Superior Court for Los Angeles County. Id. at 700. The plaintiff alleged the statute \nresulted in a shortage of judges, which, in turn, caused inordinate delays in litigation, deprived \naccess to the courts, and violated equal protection by causing litigants in Los Angeles County to \nsuffer longer delays than litigants in neighboring counties. Id. The plaintiff sued the governor as \na defendant, evidently based on his enforcement of the statute at issue via his appointment power \nto fill judicial vacancies. Id. at 701, 704. The Ninth Circuit concluded causation was satisfied, \nreasoning as follows: \n The chain of causation leading from a determination by this court that the \ndearth of judges in Los Angeles County is unconstitutional to correction of civil \nlitigation delays may appear tenuous. However, it does not at any point depend \nupon the “unfettered discretion” of third parties. Were this court to issue the \nrequested  declaration,  we  must  assume  that  it  is  substantially  likely  that  the \nCalifornia legislature, although its members are not all parties to this action, \nwould abide by our authoritative determination. See Franklin v. Massachusetts, \n505 U.S. 788, ––––, 112 S.Ct. 2767, 2777, 120 L.Ed.2d 636 (1992) (plurality). \nOnce the legislature authorized more judicial positions for Los Angeles County, \n11 \n\nGovernor Wilson would, according to the Bar Association, have a legal duty to \nfill those positions. Complaint at ¶¶ 29–30. Even if the new judges were assigned \nonly to criminal and other high-priority cases, the speeding of those cases would \ninevitably reduce the delay in general civil litigation. We therefore conclude that \nthe Bar Association has adequately demonstrated that, were this court to rule in its \nfavor, it is likely that the alleged injury would be to some extent ameliorated. \nId. at 701. In short, because the governor in Eu enforced the statute at issue by making judicial \nappointments, causation was satisfied. See id. \nAppellants fare no better under Eu. Unlike the governor’s enforcement of the statute at \nissue via his appointment power in Eu, Governor Otter does not engage in similar conduct. \nThough he appoints four of the seven PDC members, Governor Otter’s involvement with public \ndefense ends there. Additionally, in Eu, the plaintiff challenged the statute limiting the number of \njudgeships. Appellants have not made any statutory challenge. Appellants challenge instead \nalleged systemic violations of the right to counsel. But, as noted, Governor Otter’s general duty \nto  enforce  state  law  does  not  establish  causation.  E.g.,  Van  de  Kamp,  961  F.2d  at  152. \nAccordingly, Appellants do not satisfy causation as to Governor Otter.  \n(3)  The PDC \nConcerning the PDC, Appellants satisfy the causation standard. The PDC was created on \nMarch 26, 2014. See Idaho Public Defense Act, S.L. 2014, ch. 247, § 2. When the complaint was \nfiled on June 17, 2015, the PDC was tasked with the following duties:5 \n(1) The state public defense commission shall: \n(a)  Promulgate rules in accordance with the provisions of chapter 52, title \n67, Idaho Code, establishing the following: \n(i)   Training  and  continuing  legal  education  requirements  for \ndefending  attorneys,  which  shall  promote  competency  and \nconsistency  in  case  types  including,  but  not  limited  to, \ncriminal, juvenile, abuse and neglect, post-conviction, civil \ncommitment, capital and civil contempt; and \n(ii)  Uniform data reporting requirements for the annual reports \nsubmitted pursuant to section 19-864, Idaho Code. The data \nreported shall include caseload, workload and expenditures. \n(b)  On  or  before  January  20,  2015,  and  by  January  20  of  each  year \nthereafter  as  deemed  necessary  by  the  commission,  make \nrecommendations  to  the  Idaho  legislature  for  legislation  on  public \ndefense system issues including, but not limited to: \n                                                 \n5 The PDC’s powers have since been expanded. See Act of July 1, 2016, S.L. 2016, ch. 195, § 1. However, the \nPDC’s expanded powers are not relevant to our causation analysis and instead are discussed with respect to \nredressability and ripeness. See infra Parts V(B)(1)(a)(iii)(2) & V(B)(2)(b). \n12 \n\n(i)   Core requirements for contracts between counties and private \nattorneys for the provision of indigent defense services and \nproposed model contracts for counties to use; \n(ii)  Qualifications  and  experience  standards  for  the  public \ndefender and defending attorneys; \n(iii)  Enforcement mechanisms; and \n(iv)  Funding issues including, but not limited to: \n1.  Training and continuing legal education for defending \nattorneys; \n2.  Data collection and reporting efforts; and \n3.  Conflict cases. \n(c)  Hold at least one (1) meeting in each calendar quarter. \nI.C. § 19-850 (2015). In short, the PDC had three mandatory duties: (1) promulgating certain \nrules; (2) making legislative recommendations; and (3) holding quarterly meetings.  \nOf  those  three  mandatory  duties,  we  conclude  the  PDC’s  rulemaking  duty  satisfies \ncausation. As stated, the PDC’s rulemaking duty is twofold: (1) promulgate rules governing \ntraining requirements for public defenders; and (2) promulgate rules governing caseload and \nworkload reporting requirements. I.C. § 19-850(1)(a) (2015).6 Appellants allege their injuries are \ndue, in part, to a “lack of ongoing training and professional development” for public defenders, \nand public defenders’ crushing caseloads. They explain that many public defenders’ caseloads \nare  “well  above  national  standards  and  impossible  for  one  person  to  handle  effectively.” \nAppellants further allege that, despite the PDC’s awareness that public defenders are receiving \ninadequate training while laboring under excessive caseloads and the PDC’s responsibility to \npromulgate  rules  related  to  these  issues,  “no  such  rules  have  been  promulgated  to  date.” \nAlthough  Respondents  contend  the  PDC  is  not  causally  connected  to  Appellants’  injuries \nbecause public defense has been delegated to the counties, Respondents overlook the fact that the \nPDC’s rules, if promulgated, would bind the counties. See I.C. § 19-850(1)(a) (2015). Thus, \nAppellants’  injuries—allegedly  due,  at  least  in  part,  to  a  lack  of  training  and  excessive \ncaseloads—are fairly traceable to the PDC. \nHowever, the PDC has no other power that would satisfy causation. The PDC’s duties to \nmake annual recommendations to the Legislature and to hold quarterly meetings are not causes \nof Appellants’ injuries. Though Appellants emphasize that the PDC has failed to make any \nlegislative  recommendations,  any  legislative  recommendations  would  be  simply  that—\n                                                 \n6 We observe that these same rulemaking duties still exist under the 2016 amendments. I.C. § 19-850(1)(a)(i)-(ii) \n(2016). \n13 \n\nrecommendations. The Legislature would not be obligated to respond to those recommendations \nin any particular way. See Bennett, 520 U.S. at 167 (stating that causation means the injury \ncannot be “the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.”).  \nWe hold that causation as to the PDC is met because of its duty to promulgate rules \ngoverning training and caseload reporting requirements. The PDC’s failure to promulgate these \nrules illustrates that Appellants’ injuries are fairly traceable to the PDC.  \n    (iii)  Redressability \nStanding’s redressability element ensures that a court has the ability to order the relief \nsought, which must create a substantial likelihood of remedying the harms alleged. See Ciszek v. \nKootenai Cnty. Bd. of Comm’rs, 151 Idaho 123, 129, 254 P.3d 24, 30 (2011); Gonzales v. \nGorsuch,  688  F.2d  1263,  1267  (9th  Cir.  1982).  Redressability  requires  a  showing  that  “a \nfavorable decision is likely to redress [the] injury, not that a favorable decision will inevitably \nredress [the] injury.” Beno v. Shalala, 30 F.3d 1057, 1065 (9th Cir. 1994). However, it cannot be \nonly speculative that a favorable decision will redress the injury. Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. \nLaidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 181 (2000). \nRedressability and causation often overlap. See, e.g., Wash. Envtl. Council v. Bellon, 732 \nF.3d 1131, 1146 (9th Cir. 2013). The concepts “are distinct insofar as causality examines the \nconnection  between  the  alleged  misconduct  and  injury,  whereas  redressability  analyzes  the \nconnection between the alleged injury and requested judicial relief. Redressability does not \nrequire certainty, but only a substantial likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable \njudicial decision.” Id. (citations omitted). \nThe complaint requests the following relief: \nA)  Certify this case as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Idaho Rules of \nCivil Procedure; \nB)  Declare  that  the  State  of  Idaho  is  obligated  to  provide  constitutionally \nadequate representation to indigent criminal defendants, including at their \ninitial appearances; \nC)  Declare that the constitutional rights of Idaho’s indigent criminal defendants \nare being violated by the State on an ongoing basis, and provide a deadline for \nthe State to move this Court for approval of specific modifications to the \nstructure and operation of the State’s indigent-defense system; \nD)  Enjoin the State from continuing to violate the rights of indigent defendants \nby providing constitutionally deficient representation; \nE)  Enter an injunction requiring the State to propose, for this Court’s approval \nand monitoring, a plan to develop and implement a statewide system of public \n14 \n\ndefense that is consistent with the U.S. Constitution and the Constitution and \nlaws of the State of Idaho; \nF)  Enter an injunction that requires the State to propose, for this Court’s approval \nand monitoring, uniform workload, performance, and training standards for \nattorneys representing indigent criminal defendants in the State of Idaho in \norder to ensure accountability and to monitor effectiveness; \nG)  Enter an injunction barring the use of fixed-fee contracts in the delivery of \nindigent defense services in the State of Idaho;7 \nH)  Award Plaintiffs and the Class reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred \nduring the course of this litigation pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, I.C. § 12-\n117, the Private Attorney General doctrine and other applicable law; and \nI)  Grant  any  other  relief  the  Court  deems  necessary  and  proper  to  protect \nPlaintiffs and the Class from further harm. \nThe district court reasoned that “Plaintiffs ask this Court to basically intervene and \nsupersede in every single case, and in every court and county and to then make a blanket \ndetermination that every indigent criminal defendant’s rights are being violated.” The district \ncourt found “[s]uch relief [was] too speculative . . . .” The district court did not conduct separate \nredressability analyses as to each defendant. We provide that analysis below. \n(1)  State of Idaho \nRedressability as to the State is satisfied. Ordering Appellants’ requested relief against \nthe State would create a substantial likelihood of remedying the injuries alleged because the State \nhas  the  power—and  indeed  the  responsibility—to  ensure  public  defense  is  constitutionally \nadequate. Additionally,  Appellants do not allege deficiencies in just  a handful of counties. \nRather, they allege “longstanding, statewide deficiencies in the Idaho system, which result in \nactual and constructive denial of counsel across the state.” Given that the counties have no \npractical ability to effect statewide change, the State must implement the remedy.  \nUnlike the district court, we do not find Appellants’ requested relief is too speculative. \nWere the requested relief ordered, the State would be obligated to create a plan to ensure public \ndefense is constitutionally adequate. That plan would cover training standards and workload \nlimits, which, as discussed, stand at the root of many of the injuries alleged. Entities tasked with \nproviding  and  overseeing  public  defense  would  be  bound  by  the  State’s  plan.  Because \n                                                 \n7 This request is moot. Idaho law prohibits the use of fixed-fee contracts, although that prohibition only applies to \ncontracts “entered into or renewed on or after the effective date” of the 2014 legislation. I.C. § 19-859(4). \nRespondents explain that fixed-fee contracts were in place when that prohibition was enacted, but have since been \nphased out. While fixed-fee contracts are in the record, those contracts preceded the statutory prohibition.  \n15 \n\nAppellants’ requested relief, if ordered against the State, would create a substantial likelihood of \nredressing Appellants’ injuries, redressability as to the State is satisfied. \n(2)  The PDC \nIn addition, redressability as to the PDC is satisfied. Set forth above are the PDC’s duties \nas of the time when the complaint was filed. See supra Part V(B)(1)(a)(ii)(3). The PDC’s duties, \nhowever, have since been expanded. See Act of July 1, 2016, S.L. 2016, ch. 195, § 1. The parties \nagree that redressability should be examined in light of these expanded duties. As Respondents \nconcede, “[u]nder both Federal and State law, claims for injunctive or other prospective relief are \nadjudicated under the law in effect when the court decides the case, be the case before the trial \ncourt or an appellate court, because such relief operates in futuro.” See, e.g., Landgraf v. USI \nFilm Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 273 (1994) (“When the intervening statute authorizes or affects the \npropriety of prospective relief, application of the new provision is not retroactive.”); Adams \nCnty. Abstract Co. v. Fisk, 117 Idaho 513, 515, 788 P.2d 1336, 1338 (Ct. App. 1990) (noting that \n“the writ of mandate issued in this case is subject to prospective modification based on the 1989 \nstatutory amendment,” notwithstanding that the amendment was enacted after the action was \nfiled). We conduct our analysis accordingly. \nThe  Legislature  amended  Idaho’s  Public  Defense  Act,  effective  July  1,  2016,  by \nexpanding the PDC’s authority and duties. See Act of July 1, 2016, S.L. 2016, ch. 195, § 1. Most \nnotably, under the 2016 amendments, the PDC now has the duty to promulgate rules to ensure \ncounties’ public defense “is constitutionally delivered to all indigent persons in this state.” I.C. § \n19-850(1)(a)(vi)  (2016).  Additionally,  the  PDC  itself  can  now  remedy  public  defense \nshortcomings in each county if the PDC finds that the county “willfully and materially failed to \ncomply with indigent defense standards.” I.C. § 19-862A(11)(b) (2016). If the PDC finds that the \ncounty’s material failure to comply with indigent defense standards was not willful, it can \nrequire the county to explain how the failure will be remedied. I.C. § 19-862A(11)(a) (2016).  \nNevertheless, Respondents contend the PDC lacks any power to redress Appellants’ \ninjuries. We cannot agree. Ordering Appellants’ requested relief against the PDC would create a \nsubstantial likelihood of remedying the injuries alleged. That is especially true in light of the \n2016 amendments, as the PDC can promulgate rules to ensure public defense is constitutionally \nadequate and, moreover, can intervene at the county level. Yet, even analyzing redressability \nunder the PDC’s former powers shows that redressability is established. The 2016 amendments \n16 \n\ndo not alter the PDC’s duty to promulgate rules governing (1) training requirements for public \ndefenders; and (2) caseload and workload reporting requirements. I.C. § 19-850(1)(a)(i)-(ii). \nAppellants allege their injuries are caused, in part, by the PDC’s failure to promulgate these \nrules.  Were  the  PDC  to  exercise  these  powers,  it  would  create  a  substantial  likelihood  of \nremedying the injuries alleged. As such, redressability is satisfied as to the PDC. \n(b)  The “relaxed” standing analysis \nIn the alternative, Appellants argue they have standing under the “relaxed” standing \nanalysis, which they contend does not inquire as to injury in fact, causation, or redressability. In \nCoeur d’Alene Tribe v. Denney, No. 43169, 2015 WL 7421342, at *4 (Idaho Nov. 20, 2015), this \nCourt noted that it is willing to “relax ordinary standing requirements in other cases where: (1) \nthe matter concerns a significant and distinct constitutional violation, and (2) no party could \notherwise have standing to bring a claim.” Thus, Appellants argue (1) the “right to counsel at \nissue in this case could not be more fundamental”; and (2) “[i]f [they] cannot bring this lawsuit, \nthere will be no one to enforce this essential right against continued inaction and delay by the \nPDC and other government officials.”  \nWe disagree. Though violations of the right to counsel constitute significant and distinct \nconstitutional violations, Appellants are not the only ones who could bring this lawsuit. In fact, \nthe complaint alleges “the circumstances surrounding the named Plaintiffs’ representations are \nnot unique to them. Rather, they exemplify the experiences of thousands of indigent defendants \nacross the State . . . .” Because any one of those “thousands of indigent defendants” could bring \nthis lawsuit, Appellants do not satisfy the relaxed standing analysis.8 \n2.  Ripeness \nIn State v. Manley, 142 Idaho 338, 342, 127 P.3d 954, 958 (2005), we summarized \nripeness as follows: \nThe ripeness doctrine concerns the timing of a suit and asks whether a \ncase is brought too early. The purpose of the ripeness requirement is to prevent \ncourts from entangling themselves in purely abstract disagreements. Abbott Labs. \nv. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148 (1967). Under the ripeness test in Idaho, a party \nmust show (1) the case presents definite and concrete issues; (2) a real and \nsubstantial controversy exists (as opposed to hypothetical facts); and (3) there is a \npresent need for adjudication. Noh v. Cenarrusa, 137 Idaho 798, 801, 53 P.3d \n                                                 \n8 Respondents argue the relaxed standing analysis implicates only the injury in fact component of standing, not \ncausation or redressability. Our conclusion that Appellants could not satisfy the relaxed standing analysis even if it \napplied obviates the need to address this argument.  \n17 \n\n1217, 1220 (2002); Miles v. Idaho Power Co., 116 Idaho 635, 642, 778 P.2d 757, \n764 (1989). \n  “[I]n many cases,  ripeness coincides squarely  with standing’s injury in fact prong.” \nThomas v. Anchorage Equal Rights Comm’n, 220 F.3d 1134, 1138 (9th Cir. 1999). The district \ncourt’s analysis illustrates that point. The district court concluded Appellants’ claims were not \nripe largely for the same reasons it found that Appellants did not satisfy the injury in fact \nstandard. Specifically, the district court reasoned that ripeness was not satisfied because “none of \nthe  Plaintiffs’  criminal  cases  have  concluded,  no  appeals  have  taken  place,  and  no  post-\nconviction relief has been sought.” Similarly, the district court reasoned that an injury in fact was \nnot demonstrated because “the Plaintiffs have not yet been convicted of any crime in their \nunderlying cases, nor pursued or exhausted any appeal rights, nor any post-conviction relief.”  \nBecause the ripeness analysis differs as to the State and the PDC, we analyze each party \nseparately. \n  (a)  State of Idaho \nBy undertaking case-by-case inquiries into Appellants’ individual cases, the district court \nerroneously concluded the case was not ripe because Appellants “had not even pursued any \nappeal or post-conviction relief in their individual cases.” That analysis was in error. \nAppellants suffered ascertainable injuries by being actually and constructively denied \ncounsel at critical stages of the prosecution, which they allege are the result of deficiencies in \nIdaho’s public defense system. As a result, Appellants allege as follows: \nThese  constitutional  and  statutory  deficiencies  manifest  themselves  in \nmyriad ways, including (1) failure to provide counsel to indigent defendants at \ntheir  initial  appearance;  (2)  extended  and  unnecessary  pretrial  detention;  (3) \nexcessive  caseloads  that  far  exceed  national  standards;  (4)  lack  of  sufficient \ninvestigation; (5) lack of sufficient expert analysis and testimony; (6) lack of \nconsistent, effective, and confidential communication between indigent defendants \nand  public  defenders;  (7)  continued  use  of  fixed-fee  contracts  for  attorneys \nproviding indigent-defense services; (8) lack of public-defender independence; (9) \nlack of sufficient training in the field of criminal defense; (10) lack of informed \nand consistent oversight of the provision of indigent-defense services throughout \nthe State; and (11) lack of sufficient supervision and evaluation.  \nAccording  to  Appellants,  “[e]ach  of  these  deficiencies  is  directly  linked  to  the  State’s \nlongstanding and ongoing failure to provide the funding, supervision, and training necessary to \nmeet its legal obligations in the area of indigent defense.”  \n18 \n\nThese allegations establish ripeness by illustrating that “(1) the case presents definite and \nconcrete issues; (2) a real and substantial controversy exists (as opposed to hypothetical facts); \nand (3) there is a present need for adjudication.” See Manley, 142 Idaho at 342, 127 P.3d at 958. \nIndeed, we note that Respondents do not contest that ripeness is met as to the State. Therefore, \nwe hold that Appellants’ claims against the State are ripe. \n (b)  The PDC \nAdditionally, Appellants’ claims against the PDC are ripe. Manley’s first two ripeness \nrequirements—definite and concrete issues and a real, substantial controversy—are met for the \nsame reason those requirements are met against the State. However, Respondents contend there \nis no present need for adjudication due to the 2016 amendments to Idaho’s Public Defense Act, \nwhich took effect after this action was filed. See Act of July 1, 2016, S.L. 2016, ch. 195, § 1. The \nrecord before us contains no evidence concerning the PDC’s conduct in light of the 2016 \namendments. Thus, Respondents argue “[n]othing in this record shows that the PDC will not \ncarry out its new responsibilities.”  \nAlthough Respondents are correct concerning the PDC’s “new responsibilities,” they \noverlook that the 2016 amendments leave in place the key parts of the PDC’s original authority \nand duties it has had since its inception on March 26, 2014. The 2016 amendments do not alter \nthe PDC’s duty to promulgate rules governing (1) training requirements for public defenders; \nand (2) caseload and workload reporting requirements. I.C. § 19-850(1)(a)(i)-(ii). The PDC’s \nalleged failure to exercise these two duties during the initial fourteen months of the PDC’s \nexistence is at the heart of many of Appellants’ allegations.9 As a result, there is a present need \nfor adjudication. Accordingly, we conclude Appellants’ claims against the PDC are ripe. \n3.  Separation of powers \nThe final basis of the district court’s order is the separation of powers doctrine. The \nseparation  of  powers  doctrine  prohibits  “judicial  review  of  the  discretionary  acts  of  other \nbranches of government.” In re SRBA Case No. 39576, 128 Idaho 246, 261, 912 P.2d 614, 629 \n(1995). The separation of powers doctrine is “embraced in art. 2, § 1 of the Idaho Constitution. \nThe question is whether this Court, by entertaining review of a particular matter, would be \nsubstituting its judgment for that of another coordinate branch of government, when the matter \n                                                 \n9 As noted, the record before us contains no evidence that the PDC has carried out its mandatory rulemaking duties. \nAs alleged in Appellants’ complaint, “no such rules have been promulgated to date.” If the PDC were to take action, \nAppellants concede their claims against the PDC may fail for either mootness or lack of proof.  \n19 \n\nwas one properly entrusted to that other branch.” Miles v. Idaho Power Co., 116 Idaho 635, 639, \n778 P.2d 757, 761 (1989). \nThe complaint’s prayer for relief can be simplified into a request for two main remedies: \n(1) a declaratory judgment that Idaho’s public defense system is unconstitutional; and (2) an \ninjunction requiring Respondents to fix it. Concluding the requested relief raised separation of \npowers concerns, the district court reasoned as follows: \nPlaintiffs do not argue that the statute delegating the duty to provide public \ndefense is unconstitutional. They simply argue that the county commissioners in \nsome or all of the counties, and the various systems of public defense, have failed \nto protect their constitutional rights to counsel and a fair trial. Instead of filing suit \nagainst those counties where they believe their constitutional rights have been \nviolated, they brought this action against the State, the Governor, and the PDC. \nPlaintiffs  also  do  not  argue  that  the  statute  establishing  the  PDC  is \nunconstitutional.  They  argue,  instead,  that  the  PDC  is  an  ineffective  and \ninadequate response by the legislature to redress the problem of inadequate or \nineffective assistance of public defense counsel. Instead of seeking to have an act \ndeclared  unconstitutional,  they  ask  this  Court  to  declare  the  inaction  to  be \nunconstitutional. Plaintiffs ask this Court to declare the whole system (or lack of \nsystem) to be unconstitutional and to then establish standards or guidelines, based \non previous holdings of other courts, that the Governor, the PDC, the legislature, \nand all counties (whom they have not sued at this time), must follow. Plaintiffs \nask this Court to mandate that the Governor and the PDC (and the legislature and \ncounties) must enact as legislation, ordinances, or rules to meet those standards, \nand to provide adequate funding therefore. This Court does not have the power or \njurisdiction to do so under the established principles of separation of powers \nimbedded in the federal and state constitutions. \n  We disagree. Our precedent instructs that the separation of powers doctrine is triggered \nwhen (1) a “textually demonstrable constitutional commitment” assigns the matter to a particular \nbranch of government; or (2) the matter implicates another branch’s discretionary authority. See \nMiles, 116 Idaho at 639–40, 778 P.2d at 761–62. For instance, in Idaho Schools for Equal \nEducational Opportunity v. State (ISEEO IV), 140 Idaho 586, 594–97, 97 P.3d 453, 461–64 \n(2004), we held that a statute authorizing the judiciary to impose a levy violated the separation of \npowers doctrine because the Idaho Constitution commits the power to tax to the Legislature. \nSimilarly, in Diefendorf v. Gallet, 51 Idaho 619, 638, 10 P.2d 307, 314–15 (1932), we held that \nthe governor’s discretion to define the “extraordinary occasions” under which Article 4, Section \n9  of  the  Idaho  Constitution  permits  special  legislative  sessions  to  be  convened  was  a \ndiscretionary act exempt from judicial review.  \n20 \n\n  Here, Appellants’ requested relief does not implicate the separation of powers doctrine. \nThe right to counsel, which Appellants seek to vindicate, is not entrusted to a particular branch of \ngovernment. Nor does a particular branch of government merely have discretion to enforce the \nright to counsel, a fundamental right. See Gideon, 372 U.S. at 342–43. Respondents concede they \nlack discretion as to whether the right to counsel must be honored, but contend they have \ndiscretion as to how exactly that will be done. That argument misses the mark. Simply that \nRespondents will exercise some discretion when deciding which course of action to take so as to \nfulfill their affirmative duties does not implicate the separation of powers doctrine.  \n  This  conclusion  is  not  altered  even  though  Appellants  ask  the  judiciary  to  retain \njurisdiction to monitor Respondents’ efforts to bring the public defense system into constitutional \ncompliance. In Idaho Schools for Equal Education Opportunity v. State (ISEEO V), 142 Idaho \n450, 459, 129 P.3d 1199, 1208 (2005), we affirmed the declaratory judgment that Idaho’s public \nschool funding system was “simply not sufficient to carry out the Legislature’s duty under the \nconstitution” to “establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free \ncommon schools.” Moreover, ISEEO V “retain[ed] jurisdiction to consider future legislative \nefforts to comply with the constitutional mandate to provide a safe environment conducive to \nlearning so that we may exercise our constitutional role in interpreting the constitution and \nassuring that its provisions are met.” Id. at 460, 129 P.3d at 1209. Similarly, in Hellar v. \nCenarrusa, 106 Idaho 571, 576, 682 P.2d 524, 529 (1984), we affirmed the declaratory judgment \ninvalidating the Legislature’s reapportionment scheme, upheld the reapportionment plan that the \ndistrict court itself had entered, and retained jurisdiction. Concurring in part and dissenting in \npart, Justice Shepard noted that, although the reapportionment “power does not belong to nor \nshould it be exercised by, the judicial department of government, albeit if there be a legislative \nabdication of its power and duty, the courts will be required to act in the legislature’s stead.” Id. \nat 585, 682 P.2d at 538 (Shepard, J., concurring part and dissenting in part). Other jurisdictions \nhave fashioned similar relief. E.g., Washakie Cnty. Sch. Dist. No. One v. Herschler, 606 P.2d \n310, 337 (Wyo. 1980) (remanding public school financing case to district court with instructions \nto “retain jurisdiction until a constitutional body of legislation is enacted and in effect, taking \nsuch action as may be necessary to assure conformity”). \n  Respondents consistently assume that granting relief would require legislative action. \nThis,  too,  misses  the  mark.  Appellants  do  not  challenge  the  statutes  creating  the  PDC  or \n21 \n\ndelegating public defense to the counties. Instead, Appellants challenge Respondents’ inaction, \nand part of that inaction includes failures to comply with statutorily mandated duties. Thus, \nAppellants’ requested relief does not ask the judiciary to order the Legislature to do anything. \nThe New York Court of Appeals addressed a similar argument in Hurrell-Harring v. New York, \n930 N.E.2d 217, 227 (N.Y. Ct. App. 2010), when holding that the class of plaintiffs could sue for \nalleged public defense inadequacies. As Hurrell-Harring explained:  \nIt is, of course, possible that a remedy in this action would necessitate the \nappropriation  of  funds  and  perhaps,  particularly  in  a  time  of  scarcity,  some \nreordering of legislative priorities. But this does not amount to an argument upon \nwhich a court might be relieved of its essential obligation to provide a remedy for \nviolation of a fundamental constitutional right. \nId.  The  same  logic  applies  here.  Merely  that  it  is  possible  that  Idaho’s  three  branches  of \ngovernment may collaborate when deciding how to ensure our public defense system passes \nconstitutional muster does not raise separation of powers concerns. Thus, Appellants’ claims do \nnot implicate the separation of powers doctrine. \nC.  Are Appellants entitled to attorney fees on appeal? \nAppellants seek attorney fees on appeal under both Idaho’s private attorney general \ndoctrine and 42 U.S.C. § 1988. As to the private attorney general doctrine, this Court has \nexplained that:  \n[A] three-factor test [is] to be considered in awarding attorney’s fees under the \nprivate attorney general theory: “(1) the strength or societal importance of the \npublic policy vindicated by the litigation, (2) the necessity for private enforcement \nand the magnitude of the resultant burden on the plaintiff, (3) the number of \npeople standing to benefit from the decision.” These factors indicate that there \nmust be some resolution of the substantive issues before a decision on attorney \nfees can be reached. \nIdaho Sch. for Equal Educ. Opportunity v. Idaho State Bd. of Educ. (ISEEO II), 128 Idaho 276, \n285, 912 P.2d 644, 653 (1996) (emphasis added).  \nAs to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, “[a] plaintiff ‘prevails’ for purposes of § 1988 ‘when actual relief \non  the  merits  of  his  claim  materially  alters  the  legal  relationship  between  the  parties  by \nmodifying the defendant’s behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.’ ” Higher Taste, \nInc. v. City of Tacoma, 717 F.3d 712, 715 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. \n103, 111–12 (1992)). \n  Although Appellants prevail in part on appeal, they are not entitled to fees. The merits of \nAppellants’ claims still need to be addressed.  \n22 \n\nV.  CONCLUSION \nWe reverse the dismissal of Appellants’ complaint as to the State of Idaho and the PDC, \nbut  affirm  dismissal  as  to  Governor  Otter.  We  remand  this  case  for  further  proceedings \nconsistent with this opinion. We do not award attorney fees or costs on appeal. \nJustices EISMANN, W. JONES, HORTON, and BRODY, CONCUR. \n23 ",
