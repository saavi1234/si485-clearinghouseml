No. 2457-N\nGEORGE C. WALLACE, et al.,\nDefendants(cid:9) )\nBRIEF OF THE UNITED STATES\nI. Introduction \nAct No. 252 of the Alabama legislature, passed\nand signed into law on September 2, 1966, declares that\nthe Revised Statement of Policies (the HEW \"guidelines\")\nissued by the United States Commissioner of Education in\nMarch 1966 pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964, 42 U.S.C. §2000d, exceeds the authority granted by\nthe Civil Rights Act, is unconstitutional, and interferes\nwith the public duties of school officials in the State of\nAlabama. The Act declares that any assurance of compliance\nwith the guidelines given by an Alabama school board is\n\"null and void and shall have no binding effect\". Act No.\n252, §1. The Act further provides that \"No local county\n\nor city Board of Education shall have the authority to\ngive any assurance of compliance with the guidelines\"\nor to enter into any other agreement with the United\nStates which would require steps to overcome racial\nimbalance in the schools or \"which would authorize an\nagent of the United States to take any unlawful action\nwith respect to any employment practice of such board\n. \" Id\nThe Act creates a Governor's Commission and\ndeclares that the Governor and the Governor's Commission\nshall be jointly responsible for its administration.\nAct No. 252, §5. Pursuant to the Act, local school\nboards by majority vote may request that the Governor\nand the Commission act for it in matters pertaining to\nfederal financial assistance. Act No. 252, §3. Further,\nfunds are authorized and appropriated to be paid out to\nlocal school boards to replace some of the funds forfeited\nby the boards because of their refusal to give or comply\nwith federal assurances or with any other federal require-\nment which may be declared invalid by the Supreme Court\nof Alabama.(cid:9) 1/ Funds are also appropriated to\ncover the reasonable expenses incurred by the Commission\nin carrying out the purposes of the Act. Act No. 252, §4.\nThe Governor's Commission is given an advisory responsibility\nin connection with \"the peace and order of any school\"\nover and above \"the power and authority of the Governor\nto preserve peace or order\". Act No. 252, §7.\n1/ The Act excludes from the repayment scheme funds\navailable under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act\nof 1965.\n2\n\nOn September 12, 1966, the NAACP State\nConference of Branches and other individual plaintiffs\ninstituted this action for a declaratory judgment\ninvalidating Act No. 252 and for an injunction\nagainst its implementation. Their complaint is\nbased upon the due process and equal protection\nclauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and the impair-\nment of contracts clause of Article I, Section 10\nof the United States Constitution. On November 22,\n1966 the United States filed a complaint in this\naction against the Governor and the Governor's\nCommission in which it sought a declaratory judg-\nment that Act No. 252 is invalid under the supremacy\nclause of the United States Constitution because\nit interferes with the lawful federal enforcement\nof Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In\ntheir answer to the complaint and in a separate\nthird-party complaint against the Commissioner of\nEducation and the Secretary of Health, Education and\nwelfare, the defendants assert that the guidelines\nand the HEW regulations issued pursuant to Title VI\nexceed the authority conferred by Title VI and are\nrepugnant to the Constitution.\n3\n\n6\nThis action was heard on November 30, 1966,\nsimultaneously with Lee v. Macon County Board of \nEducation, C.A. No. 604-E (MD Ala.). If we are\ncorrect in our claim that the HEW regulation and\nthe Commissioner's guidelines are valid, all issues\nin this case are resolved except for a determination\nwhether Act No. 252 presents a real enough threat\nto the enforcement of Title VI to warrant a judicial\ndeclaration of invalidity. We treat these two\nbasic points in the following sections of this\nbrief. 2 /\n2/ On December 29, 1966, the Fifth Circuit decided\na group of seven consolidated school cases under\nthe caption of United States v. Jefferson County Board \nof Education, et al., C.A. 5, No. 23345. In this\nimportant opinion, the Court sustained all the\nprovisions of the HEW guidelines and declared them\nto be the judicial standards school boards would\nhave to meet in the courts of the Fifth Circuit,\nirrespective of HEW's administrative enforcel=t\nof Title VI. Page citations to that opinion are\nnecessarily(cid:9) to the clerk's original copy. The\nregular slip opinion was not available at the time\nthis brief was prepared.\n4\n\n41. The HEW regulation and the Rev:Lsed Statement of \n775=77s are valid exercises of authority derived \nfrom Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nA. The HEW regulation is valid\nSection 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42  USC\n§2000d, makes it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of\nrace in the administration of any program receiving federal\nfinancial assistance. In Section 602 of the Act, 42 USC,\n32000d-1, Congress imposed on each federal agency ad-\nministering federal programs of financial assistance the\nduty of enforcing the guarantee of section 601 of the Act\nprovides in part:\nEach Federal department and agency which\nis empowered to extend Federal financial\nassistance to any program or activity, by way\nof grant, loan, or contract other than a\ncontract of insurance or guaranty, is\nauthorized and directed to effectuate the\nprovisions of section 601 with respect to\nsuch program or activity by issuing rules,\nregulations, or orders of general applica-\nbility which shall be consistent with\nachievement of the objectives of the statute\nauthorizing the financial assistance in\nconnection with which the action is taken.\nNo such rule, regulation, or order shall\nbecome effective unless and until approved\nby the President.\nPursuant to section 602, the Department of Health,\nEducation and Welfare issued a regulation setting forth\nthe requirements for the receipt of funds under assistance\nprograms administered by the Department. 45 CFR, Part 30.\nThe regulation, in accordance with the requirement of\nsection 602, was approved by the President. 29 F.R. 16298\n(1964). The regulation requires that every application\nfor assistance shall \"contain or be accompanied by an\nassurance that the program will be conducted or the\nfacility operated in compliance with all requirements\nimposed by or pursuant to this part,\" and that \"the\n5\n\nresponsible Department official shall specify the form\nof the foregoing assurances for each program.(cid:9) .\" 45 CFR\n§80.4(a). With respect to continuing State programs, and\nin anticipation of a period of transition from a status\nof noncomcompliance to compliance, the regulation requires\napplicants to state the extent to which they are not in\ncompliance and further requires that their applications\n\"provide or be accompanied by provision for such methods\nof administration for the program as are found by the\nresponsible Department official to give reasonable\nassurance that the applicant and all recipients of\nFederal financial assistance under such program will\ncomply with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to\nthis part, including methods of administration which give\nreasonable assurance that any noncompliance indicated\nin the statement under subparagraph (1) of this para-\ngraph will be corrected.\" 45 CFR §80.4(b). Regarding\npublic school systems the regulation provides that in\nthe absence of a relevant court order, the school board\nmust submit \"a plan for desegregation of such school or\nschool system which the Commissioner of Education\ndetermines is adequate to accomplish the purposes of\nthe Act and this part, and provides reasonable assurance\nthat it will carry out such plan.(cid:9) .\" 45 CFR W.4(c).\nApart from challenging the validity of specific\nportions of the guidelines, the defendants suggest that\nthe HEW regulation unlawfully delegates to the Commis-\nsioner the authority to set substantive standards for\nschool desegregation without the Presidential approval\nrequired by §602, and they argue further that the Com-\nmissioner may not lawfully defer or seek to terminate\n6\n\nS\nfunds upon the failure of a school board to file an\nassurance of compliance with the guidelines or a court-\napproved desegregation plan. It is the Government's\nposition, on the other hand, that each of these elements\nin the scheme of Title VI enforcement is an acceptable\ntechnique of administrative law and is consistent with\nthe Congressional purpose declared in Title VI.\nSection 602 designates each Department head as\nthe promulgator of enforcement regulations. The HETJ\nregulation, as already noted, had to be drafted in\nterms general enough to cover the fund programs of all\nsub-agencies in the Department, which administers myriad\nhealth, public welfare and social security programs in\naddition to federal aid to education. The Secretary of\nHealth, Education and Welfare could not in his own regu-\nlation describe the detailed standards each recipient of\nfunds from the Department would have to meet. Determination\nof particular standards was, with the required approval\n3/\nof the President, delegated to the sub-agency heads,\nalthough formal termination of course is not left to\nthe subordinate administrators.\nThe courts have long since adjusted to the\ncomplexity of federal administration and the necessity\nof delegation ID/ top-level executive officials of their\npower to establish particular standards under a general\ngrant of regulatory authority. In this connection, the\nFifth Circuit has said:\nThe express provisions aside, we think\nit is too clear for debate that Congress\nin conferring the powers in question, did\nnot expect or intend that the President\nshould in person execute all the vast\nduties imposed upon him, and that if there\n3/ 45CFR §80. 4(b)(2). This section applies only to\ncontinuing programs operated by a State agency.\n- 7 -\n\nQ\nhad been no express authority to act by\ndeputies, that authority would have been\nimplied. The long and unbroken history\nof our government presents not a few, but\na multitude of, instances where powers,\nthe nature of which are such that they are\nimpossible of personal execution, have\nbeen delegated to an office or a depart-\nment. In all of those cases, the \nestablisfted practice aas een that the\nduties so deleareper.W/\nthe many persons the • e eate aas\nse_ected to perform ther717177=s\nadded). [Shreveport Engraving Co. v.\n(cid:9)United StaTTETr43 F. 27122277727\n(C.A. 5, L944), cert. denied, 323 U.S.\n749].\nThe necessity for delegation of its own force supports\na subdelegation of administrative authority. \"The same\nprinciples which will admit of delegation in any case\nmay suffice to justify a redelegation or subdelegation.\"\nShreveport Engraving Co. v. United States, supra, at 228;\nSavoretti v. Small, 244 F. 2d 292, 297 (C.A. 5, 1957).\nSee 1 Davis, Administrative Law §9.05 (1953). In view\nof the enormous variety and volume of fund programs\nadministered by HEW, and the expertise needed to administer\neach one efficiently, it would require the clearest\nCongressional negation of authority to support a con-\nclusion that, pursuant to *602, the Secretary of HEW\ncould not delegate to the Commissioner the burden of\nestablishing particular standards which in the Com-\nmissioner's judgment school boards would have to meet\nto bring themselves into compliance with the general\nrequirements of Title VI.\nB. HEW may lawfully require assurances of\nompliance from applicants row te era\nassistance\nThe defendants argue that there is no relation-\nship between the requirement in the HEW regulation of\nan assurance of compliance, 45 C.F.L. PO- 4(a), and\n\nthe discrimination forbidden by §601 of the Act, and\nthey conclude that the statute does not authorize\ndeferral of action or termination of funds upon the\nfailure of a school board to file the required assurance. 4/.\nThe test under §602 is whether the regulation is calculated\n\"to effectuate the provisions of section 601\" and is\n\"consistent with achievement of the objectives of the\n4/ Deferral of action is an interim process invoked\nW the Commissioner while a potential recipient is\nunder investigation, and the deferral applies only to\nprograms under which the applicant is not yet rece-Ilv-\ning funds -- that is, the applicant continues to receive\nfunds for which it has already become eligible. Dep.\nof Howe at 75-76. Termination proceedings in accordance\nwith §602 of the Act lead to a denial of funds already\ncommitted. Although we think it plain that the author-\nity to defer funds pending a final decision is inherent\nin Title VI itself, the Fountain Amendment adopted as\npart of Public Law 750 (89th Cong., 2nd sess.) and signed\ninto law on November 3, 1966, makes the power to defer\nexplicit. The statute reads (P.L. 89-750, 60 Stat. 1209):\nThe Commissioner of Education shall not\ndefer action or order action deferred on\nany application by a local educational\nagency for funds authorized to be appropri-\nated by this Act, by the Elementary and\nSecondary Education Act of 1965, by the Act\nof September 30, 1950 (Public Law 57L.,\nEighty-first Congress), by the Act of Septem-\nber 23, 1950 (Public Law 815, Eighty-first\nCongress), or by the Cooperative Research\nAct, on the basis of alleged noncompliance\nwith the provisions of title VI of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 for more than sixty\ndays after notice is given to such local\nagency of the opportunity for a hear-\ning as provided in section 602 of title VI\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1954, such hear-\ning to be held within sixty days of such\nnotice, unless the time for such hearing\nis extended by mutual consent of such local\nagency and the Commissioner, and such\ndeferral shall not continue for more than\nthirty days after the close of any such hear-\ning that such local educational agency has\nfailed to comply with the provisions of\ntitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nstatute authorizing the financial(cid:9) assistance in\nconnection with which the action is taken.\" It is\ndifficult to see how the assurance requirement could\nbe inconsistent with any of the o) jectives of the\nmany statutes authorizing federal aid to pudic\nschools. None of those statutes contemplate unequal\nor discriminatory treatment of students and none\nguarantee to recipients the automatic right to re-\nceive funds irrespective of general procedural re-\nquirements imposed cy the Office of Education.\nThe Office of Education is the conduit of many\npillions of dollars to many thousands of school Joards\neach year. The efficient conduct of its programs 3y\nthe Commissioner requires the use of administrative\ndevices which will facilitiate control of the programs\nand will enaole the Commissioner to meet the o3ligations\nimposed upon him oy statute, including Title VI.\nThere is no way the Commissioner and his staff can\ninvestigate every recipient school system oefore\nauthorizing funds to make certain the school system\nis in compliance with Title VI, the HEW regulation,\nand the guidelines. For the Commissioner, as for other\nagency heads in HEW operating under the general regu-\nlation, the assurance is an indispensable contact with\neach local school system. It is a formal means 3y which\napplicants for funds inform the Commissioner that\nthey know of the conditions for the receipt of funds\nand that they have decided to meet those conditions.\nIn the aosence of the assurance, the Commissioner would\nhave to release funds on the mere hope that recipients\nwill comply with federal requirements, for he is without\n- 10 -\n\nthe means of investigating compliance beforehand. The\nassurance , apart from whether it is judicially enforceable,\nis a technique of administrative inquiry , and as such\nshould oe given free rein oy the coArts. In FCC v.\nPottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U.S. 134, 142-143 (1940),\nthe Supreme Court in speaking of the freedom of proce-\ndural action administrative agencies should enjoy, said:\nAdministrative agencies have power\nthemselves to initiate inquiry, or,\nwhen their authority is invoked , to control\nthe range of investigation in ascer-\ntaining what is to satisfy tile require-\nments of the puolic interest in relation\nto the needs of vast region,_ and some-\ntimes the whole nation in the enjoy-\nment of facilities for transportation,\ncommunication and other essential puolic\nservices. . . . [Agencies] should oe\nfree to fashion their own rules of\nprocedure and to pursue methods of in-\nquiry capaule of permitting them to dis-\ncharge their mutitudinous duties.\nWhat the Court said of the power the Federal Communi\ncations Commission in FCC v. WJR , 337 U.S. 265, 282\n(1949) equally applies to the oroad grant of rule-\nmaking authority conferred oy §602:\n.(cid:9) . Congress was mindful not only\nof the ends of justice out also of the\nproper dispatch of the Commission's\nousiness, a matter not unrelated to\nachieving the ends of justice_ and\nleft largely to its judgment the de-\ntermination of the manner of conduct-\ning its ousiness which would most\nfairly and reasonauly accommodate those\nends.\nSee also FCC v. Schriever ; 381 U.S. 279 (1965).\nCongress understood that non-discrimination\nassurances would oe one device employed by federal\nagencies under the rule-making power conferred .4 §602.\nSenator Pastore, floor manager for Title VI, declared\n7059 (196)-)]:\n[110 Cong. Rec. \n\nA\nThe rule or regulation issaed oy\nthe particular Federal agency wold\nvary, depending on the nature and\nmethod of administration of the par-\nticular assistance program. There\nmight oe rules, for example, gov-\nerning the conduct of recipients of\nassistance, or orders specifying a\nstandard form of written assurance\nor understanding to ue given uy each\napplicant for assistance, or perhaps a\nstandard provision-of-assistance\ncontract.\n7066]:\nSenator Rioicoff added [Id. at \nFor example, the most effective way\nfor an agency to proceed [under Title\nVI] would often be to adopt a rule that\nmade the nondiscrimination requirement\npart of a contractual ooligation on the\npart of the recipient. Then violation\nof such a requirement would normally\ngive the agency the right to Jring a\nlawsuit to enforce its own _ontract.\nApart from specific Congressional referen(_es to\nassurances included in contracts or otherwise req iced\nof applicants, Congress intended generally that each\nagency ue the judge of the means oy which its dAy under\n§602 would be met. The s'ostantially unqualified rale-\nmaking power conferred iy the statute makes this clear,\nand Senator Pastore emphasized the point in the course\nof the Senate deoate (Id. at 7053):\nAction is mandatory, out the proce-\ndure oy which that action is accom-\nplished is discretionary suoject how-\never, to the approval of the President.\nNothing in the record in this case or in the HEW regu-\nlation itself suggests tiat the Secretary or his suoor-\ndinates have used their discretion aruitrarily or without\nregard to the oujectives uoth of Title VI or the statutes\ngranting federal funds to puolic school systems.\n- 12 -\n\nC. The Guidelines are valid\nUnder the HEW regulation each responsible Depart-\nment official is obliged to \"provide assistance and\nguidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily\nwith this part.\" 45 CFR §30.6(a). The aegulation thus\ncontemplates administration of financial assistance to\npublic school systems by the Commissioner of Education\nthrough his separate determinations that individual school\nboards have met or are preparing to meet the requirements\nof section 601 as they apply to public school systems.\nAlthough the technique c'of administration is lea to the\nCommissioner, he is directed to provide guidance to\npotential recipients, and the Revised Statement of\nPolicies, which is the subject of the Alabama statute\nchallenged in this case, is the Commissioner's effort\nto provide that guidance.\nThe revised statement is not a substantive\nregulation which of itself requires particular affirm-\native action, therefore it does not require the approval\nby the President contemplated by section 602 for the\ngeneral regulation. 5/ The regulation upon aoproval\nassumes the status of law, see Public Utilities Commission \n5/ The Commissioner does not expect, nor could he, that\nhearing examiners at fund termination proceedings would\nconsider themselves bound by the guidelines. Dep. of Howe\nat 174. \"The Guidelines do not purport to be a rule or\nregulation or order. They constitute a statement of policy\nunder paragraph 80.4(c) of the HEW Regulations issued\nafter the President approved the regulations December 3,\n1964.\" United States et  al. v. Jefferson County Board of \nEducation, et al., (No. 7745, C.A. 5, December 29, l9o( )\ns ip opinion at 13.\n\nC\nv. United States, 355 U.S. 534 (1953), Paul v. United\nStates, 371 U. S. 245 (1963), while the revised state-\nment, although given actual effect by the Commissioner\non a case-to-case basis, is simply the Commissioner's\nannouncement regarding the standards and conditions\nindividual school boards must meet to enable him to\ndetermine, in accordance with the regulation, that\ntheir \"methods of administration. . . will comply with\nall requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part.\"\n45 CFR §30.4(b).-6\"\nIn formulating the revised statement, the Com-\nmissioner, of course, had to be guided by the admonition\nof section 602 that the regulations it authorizes, and\na fortiori the administrative standards they in turn\nauthorize, \"shall be consistent with achievement of the\nobjectives\" of section 601. He is specifically authorized\nto make judgments regarding the \"methods of administration\"\nof a local school system which will accomplish compliance\nwith section 601 and the regulation, and he may require\nschool boards to identify their methods of administration\nso that he may determine whether they are entitled to\nfinancial assistance. The Revised Statement of Policies\naccomplishes these ends and does no more.\n6 / The particular language of the regulation contem-\nplates the setting of substantive standards by administra-\ntors beyond those contained in the regulation itself.\nSections 30.4(a) and (b) both refer to compliance\n\"with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this\npart\" (emphasis added), implying a designation of\nrequirements by an authority outside of the regulation\nitself.\n- 1L -\n\n0\nIn United States v. Jefferson County Board of\nEducation, et al. (C.A. 5, No. 23345, opinion dated\nDecember 29, 1966) the Fifth Circuit examined the re-\nlationship between constitutional requirements and the\nHEW guidelines and concluded that there was a substantial\nidentity between the two. The Court said (slip opinion\nat 3):\n[W]e hold that HEU t s standards are\nsubstantially the same as this Court's\nstandards. They are required by the\nConstitution and, as we construe them,\nare within the scope of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964.\nNotwithstanding this recent and authoritative judicial\napproval of the revised statement, we think it useful\nto describe the guidelines in some detail and to answer\nin light of the record in this case the specific\nobjections to them raised by the defendants.\nThe revised statement, 45 CFR, Part 181, contains\nthree major substantive sections -- one setting forth\nbasic requirements for all voluntary desegregation plans,\nand two others which alternatively provide specific\nstandards for plans based on geographic attendance zones\nand plans based on free choice of schools. 45 CFR, Part\n181, Subparts B, C, and D. The standards of administration\nthey announce are either derived prom settled judicial\nrequirements for desegregation or are so clearly related\nto the accomplishment of desegregation that there can be\nno question of their validity under section 601 and the\nimplementing regulation. 7 /\n7 / \"The HEW Guidelines agree with decisions of this\ncircuit and of the similarly situated Fourth Eighth\nCircuits. And they stay within the Congressional man-\ndate.\" United States v.

Further, the Commissioner\nwill consider the racial composition of the school staff\nin determining whether students are subjected to dis-\ncrimination. The schools are required to hire new\npersonnel without regard to race, and to make personnel\nassignments that will eliminate past patterns of\nsegregation. 45 CFR 5181.13. The statement suggests\ncertain specific steps a school system might take to\ninitiate staff desegregation, 45 CFR 5101.13(d), none of\nwhich are in terms made obligatory. ,U1 services,\nactivities, and programs must be desegregated, including\nathletics, transportation, and speciai educational pro-\ngrams. 45 CFrt 5181.14. Further, a system normally\nwould be expected to close facilities originally\ndesigned for use by Negroes and which are inadequate and\ninferior to facilities available for whites.(cid:9) •5 CFR\n§181.15. School officials must publicize and seek\ncommunity support for their desegregation plans and must\nprotect or seek protection for persons exercising rights\nunder the plans. 45 CFR 5181.14(c).\nThe specific standards for school boards choosing\na geographic attendance zone plan require that zone\nboundaries of the single system may not be designed to\nperpetuate or promote segregation (45 cm 5101.32) and\nthat students must be assigned to schools in the zones\nwhere they live unless the special educational needs of\nthe student require another assignment or the student,\n- 16. -\n\nupon permission by the school board, chooses to transfer\nto a school where is own race is in the minority from\none where he is in the majority (45 cFP. §181.33).\nThe standards required of free choice plans do not\nvary from those generally required by the Fifth Circuit\nin its recent school desegregation decisions, and include\nthe mandatory exercise of choice by all students each\nyear (45  *181.44); 8/ full and thorough notice to\nCFI'. \nstudents and parents without the imposition of technical\nrequirements regarding form (45 CFR *181.46); 9 / and\nassignment according to choice except in the case of\novercrowding, in which case preference must be given\nonly on the basis of residential proximity to the\nschool (45 CFR *181.49).10/ Preferences based upon\nprior attendance at a school may be given only for\nspecified reasons brought to the attention of the\nCommissioner (Ibid.)

It announces that the Commissioner\nwill scrutinize the operation of such plans to\ndetermine whether they are operating effectively,\ntaking as the single most significant indication\nof effectiveness the number of Negro students\nactually in attendance at formerly all-white schools.\nIbid. Where the number of Negroes transferring\nis less than would normally be expected and little\nor no faculty desegregation has occurred, the\nCommissioner may require some further action by\nschool officials. 11/ As guideposts to determine\nthe scheduling of free choice plans for review, the\nstatement sets out statistical criteria suggesting\n11/ See Dep. of Howe at 83-84. Similarly, the Fifth\nCircuit concluded that a plan was defective principally\nbecause of the low number of Negro transfers under it.\nIn Davis v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile \nCounty,-364 F.2d 896, 901 (C.A. 5, 1966), the Court said:\ntt . .(cid:9) [W]e conclude that the Moible plan falls far\nshort of the requirements of the law in several respects.\nPrincipal among these is the fact that even as to\nthose grades which, under the plan, have actually\nbecome 'desegregated' there is no true substance in\nthe alleged desegregation. Less than two-tenths of\none percent of the Negro children in the system are\nattending white schools.\"\n\nthe expected increase in Negro transferees relative\nto the number of transferees in the preceding year.12/\nWhere the expected increases do not materialize the\nCommissioner may determine from this and other\nevidence that the plan is not working fairly, and\nmay require additional steps to promote the\nexercise of free choice. He may also require\nadoption of a different kind of plan if adjust-\nments cannot be expected that will correct the\ndeficiencies in the free choice plan. Id.\n12 / \"Common sense suggests that a gross discrepancy\nbetween the ratio of Negroes to white children in\na school and the HEW percentage guides raises an\ninference that the school plan is not working as it\nshould in providing a unitary, integrated system.\"\nUnited States v. Jefferson County Board of Education,\nsupra, at 45.\n\nD. The Commissioner may require faculty desegregation\nNone of the standards of the revised statement\nrequire school boards to take action not positively\nrequired by the Fourteenth Amendment and therefore by\nsection 601, or which could not properly be required\nof them by a court implementing the equal protection\nclause. It is plain, for example, that teacher desegre-\ngation is an integral part of any desegregation plan,\nnot because teachers have employment rights vis-a-vis\nthe school board, but because students are ent--tled to\na non-racial education, and assignment of teachers to\nstudents on the basis of race denies them that right.\nSee Bradley v. School Board of Richmond, 332 U.S. 103\n(1965); Rogers v. Paul, 332 U.S. 198 (1965); Davis v.\nBoard of School Commissioners of Mobile County, 364 F.\n2d 896 (C.A. 5, 1966); Singleton v.

The very recent decision in Clark v. Board of\nEducation of the Little Rock  School District, C.A. 3\n(No. 18, 368, opinion dated December 15, 1966) requires\nthat specific and far-reaching steps must be taken now to\nend faculty segregation. The Court said (slip opinion at\n13):\nwe agree that faculty segregation encourages\npupil segregation and is detrimental to\nachieving a constitutionally required non-\nracially operated school system. It is\nclear that the Board may not continue to\noperate a segregated teaching staff.\n. . . At this point the 3oard Ls going\nto have to take accelerated and positive\naction to end discriminatory practices\nin staff assignment and recruitment.\n- 20 -\n\nDefendants argue that insofar as the Commissioner\nrequires faculty desegregation in his administration of\nTitle VI, his action is contrary to section 604 of the\nAct , 42 U.S.C. §2000d-3, which provides as follows:\nNothing contained in this title shall\nbe construed to authorize action under\nthis title cy any department or agency\nwith respect to any employment practice\nof any employer_ employment agency_\nor lapor organization except where a\nprimary oJoective of the Federal financial\nassistance is to provide employment.\nConcededly, segregation of faculty is an employment prac-\ntice vis-a-vis the teachers, but with respect to students\nit is an educational practice incompatiule with a pro-\ngram of compliance with the equal protection clause and\nTitle VI. See Rogers v. Paul, 302 U.S. 198, 200 (1965).\nSince §601 confers on students a right to a nondis-\ncriminatory education in school systems receiving\nfederal assistance, see Lemon v. Bossier Parish School \nBoard, 240 F. Supp. r(09 (W.D. La. 1965), the government's\nduty under §602 to enforce that right requires that it\ndeal with all aspects of a school system involving\ndiscrimination that Jear upon the students. Moreover,\nit is naive to label faculty segregation as an employ-\nment practice and nothing more. (cid:9) historically it\nhas Jeen one of the most obvious manifestations of\na segregated system. That faculty segregation is\namong other things, an employment practice is no\nwarrant for bringing the practice within the immunity\nof §604. This question has now been settled cy the\ndecision in United States v. Jefferson County Board of \nEducation supra, where the court ruled:\n- 21 -\n\n• • • [U]nder Section 601 it is the\nschool children, not the teachers\n(employees), who are the primary Bene-\nficiaries of federal assistance to\npublic schools. Faculty integration\nis essential to student desegrega-\ntion. To the extent that teacher dis-\ncrimination jeopardizes the success\nof desegregation, it is unlawful wholly\naside from its effect upon individual\nteachers. [Slip opinion at 39].\nThere is compelling evidence that Congress did\nnot intend that §60)4 would have the impact attriJuted\nto it ) the defendants. Senator Humphrey, the princi-\npal administration spokesman for the Civil Rights Act\nof 196)4, made the following reference to the\nCommissioner's responsi)ility regarding faculty dese-\ngregation [110 Cong. Rec. 6545 (196)4)]:\nIt is not expected that funds would\noe cut off so long as reasonaule steps\nwere Jeing taken in good faith to end\nunconstitutional segregation.\nIn such cases, the Commissioner might\nalso oe justified in requiring elimina-\ntion of racial discrimination in employ-\nment or assignment of teachers, at\nleast where such discrimination affected\nthe educational opportunities of\nchildren.\nWhen the Senate leadership proposed a suostitute bill\nwhich contained the present §604, Senator Humphrey stated\nthat §60)4 \"is in line with the provisions of §602 and\nserves to spell out more precisely the declared scope\nof coverage of the title.\" 110 Cong. Rec. 12720.\n\na\nThere is no basis in the sparse legislative his-\ntory of §60)4  'or concluding that it was intended to\nchange the particular meaning of §601 that had ueen elucidated\no Senator Humphrey with respect to schools when Title\nVI first came before the Senate. Moreover, since the\ncourts have now estaulished that faculty desegregation\nis an essential element in the elimination of a dual\nsystem, a construction of Title VI which would inhioit\nadministrative implementation of that requirement would\nrender Title VI enforcement something less than a fully\neffective instr_;mentforprotection of the rights declared\noy §601. Congress surely did not intend that the\nCommissioner of Education should oe foruidden from\nact . ng against a practice which the courts have ruled\nunlawfully discriminates against theprimary oene-\nficiaries of federal aid to education -- namely, the\n3/\nstudents,1\n13/ Early oujections to Title VI expressed the fear\nthat private recipients of federal assistance , such as\nfarmers would oe compelled to hire Negroes simply\noecause they accepted the assistance. See, e.g.,\nHouse Report No. 91)4 at 69 (88th Cong., 1st sess.,\nminority views). Sine it was never intended that\nTitle VI should affect the employment practices of the\nultimate individual oeneficiaries of federal programs,\n§604 was added to make this construction explicit.\nUnited States v. Jefferson County Board of Education \nsupra, at 40.\n\nThe Commissioner does not require action to \novercome \"racial imbalance.\"\nThe revised statement imposes no standards which\nwould require, to borrow the language of section 401 of\nthe 1964 Act, 42 U.S.C. §2000c(b), \"the assignment of\nstudents to public schools in order to overcome racial\nimbalance.\" Assuming that the definition of desegrega-\ntion in section 401 to exclude the correction of racial\nimbalance signifies the policy embodied in Title VI,\nthere is nothing in the revised statement contrary to\nthat policy.14/ The Commissioner has settled upon\nstated percentage increases in the numbers of Negroes\nattending formerly all white schools as a guide to him\nin selecting those free-choice plans which his office\nwill most carefully review. 45 CFR *181.54. The per-\ncentage increases that the Commissioner uses as warning\nsignals calling for closer observation of a plan in\noperation are predicated on very low initial transfers\nby Negroes; for example, transfers by 8 or 9 per cent\nof the Negroes in a system in 1965-66 is considered a\n14/(cid:9) \"But there is nothing in the language of the Act \nor in the legislative history that e uatescorrective\nacts to desegregate or to integrate a dual system \ninitially based on de jure segregation with acts to \nbring about a racial balance in a system based on bona \nfide neighborhood schools.\" United States v. Jefferson \nCounty Board of Education at 43(a) (emphasis in the\noriginal).\n\n\"significant percentage of the students.\" Ibid. Thus,\nthe function of the percentages is to identify those\nsystems in which legally required desegregation might\nnot be taking place effectively. The percentages\nimpose no compulsory transfer requirements. Their\nprincipal impact is to establish an internal procedure\nby which matters will be assigned for administrative\nreview, and by annauccing them, the Commissioner is\nalerting the school boards as to when they may\nexpect close scrutiny. No action can be taken on\nthe basis of the percentages; the statement declares,\nregarding the percentages, that \"where there is sub-\nstantial deviation from these expectations, and the\nCommissioner concludes, on the basis of the choices\nactually made and other available evidence, that the\nplan is not operating fairly, or is not effective to\nmeet constitutional and statutory requirements, he\nwill require the school system to take additional\nsteps to further desegregation.\" Ibid. In the absence\nof a specific determination by the Commissioner based\nupon evidence peculiar to a given school system that\nits desegregation plan simply is not working, the per-\ncentages contained in the statement are given no\nadministrative effect.15/\n15/(cid:9) See Dep. of Howe at 84, 88-89.\n\nThe evidence in this case refutes the defend-\nants' claim that the Commissioner rejects assurances\nand defers funds merely upon application of a\nstatistical test based upon percentages of Negro\ntransferees. It does show that when a school dis-\ntrict operating under a voluntary free-choice plan\ntakes no steps to desegregate its faculty and an\nunexpectedly low number of Negro students have trans-\nferred to white schools, that combination of factors\nmay induce the Commissioner to defer an application\nfor new funds until further investigation reveals\nwhether on some other basis there is substantial com-\npliance with §601 and the equal protection clause.16/\nSince both of these factors are judicially taken to\nbe evidence of an inadequate desegregation plan, Davis \nv. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County\nsupra, the Commissioner is justified in treating them\nthe same way.\nThe defendants in their pre-trial memorandum\nhave entirely misrepresented the content of the\nrevised statement. They wrongly assert (Dfts. Pre-\nTrial Memoranda at 5-6) that the Commissioner will\nrequire further action under a free-choice plan if\nthe expected percentages of transfersEet forth in the\nguidelines (42 CFR §181.54) are not realized. As\nexplained above, and as the evidence in this case\nshows, the guidelines suggest no such requirement\n16/(cid:9) See Dep. of Howe at 84-89.\n- 25 -\n\nand none is imposed by the Commissioner. The Fifth\nCircuit in United States v. Jefferson County Board\nof Education, supra, stated in this connection:\nThere is no cross-district or cross-town\nbussing requirement. There is no provision\nrequiring school authorities to place white\nchildren in Negro schools and Negro children\nin white schools for the purpose of striking\na racial balance in a school or school dis-\ntrict proportionate to the racial population\nof the community or school district. The\nprovision referring to percentages is a gen-\neral rule of thumb or objective administra-\ntive guide for measuring progress in deseg-\nregation rather than a firm requirement that\nmust be met. (Slip opinion at 44.)\nDefendants further assert that the guidelines\nrequire bussing to overcome \"racial imbalance\", )7  /\nciting §§181.14, 181.49, and 181.51. Section 181.14,\napplicable to all types of desegregation programs,\nrequires that \"routes and schedules must be changed\"\nso as to eliminate \"dual or segregated transporta-\ntion systems.\" The requirement has nothing to do with\n17/(cid:9) The term \"racial imbalance\" refers to the situ-\nation where geographic assignment compels Negroes to\nattend predominently Negro schools in which the propor-\ntion of Negro pupils exceeds the proportion of Negroes\nat the same grade level in the community. See Fiss,\nRacial Imbalance in the Public Schools: The Constitu-\ntional Concepts, 78 Harv. L.R. 564 (1965). Its legal\nimplications, quite different from those relating to\nsystems founded on racial assignments, are treated in\nDennis v. Kansas City, 336 F. 2d 988 (C.A. 10, 1964);\nBell v. School City (cid:9) 324 F. 2d 209\n(C.A. 8, 1963); and Springfield School Commission v.\nBarksdale, 348 F. 2d 261 (C.A. 1, 1965).\n\nracial imbalance. It means that one system of\nbusses for Negroes and another for whites is un-\nacceptable and that no student shall be assigned\nto a particular bus because of his race or color.\nA common practice in systems operating on free-\nchoice plans is to bus the Negro students attending\npredominantly white schools in special busses for\nNegroes only, while busses for white students going\nto the same schools pass by or through the Negro\nneighborhoods.(cid:9) Sections 181.14 prohibits that\nkind of practice. Sections 181.49 and 181.51 apply\nonly to free-choice plans and they prohibit denial of\na student's choice on any ground other than over-\ncrowding. Section 181.51 specifically excludes\ntransportation difficulties as a basis for denying\na choice.18/\nRegarding these objections, we note first\nthat the Fifth Circuit has held that overcrowding is\nthe only acceptable basis for denial of a free choice,\nDavis v. Board of School  Commissioners of Mobile County,\nsupra. Further, the guidelines provisions to which the\ndefendants most forcefully object apply whenever a\nschool board chooses to desegregate by means of a free-\nchoice plan. Because under a free-choice plan the\n18/ Section 407(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n42 U.S.C. §2000c-6(a), disclaims authorization for any\ncourt order \"seeking to achieve a racial balance in\nany school by requiring the transportation of pupils or\nstudents from one school to another or one school dis-\ntrict to another in order to achieve such racial\nbalance. . . .\" Regarding this provision, Judge Wisdom\nin United States v. Jefferson County Board of Education,\nsupra, stated (slip opinion at 35): \"The furnishing of\ntransportation as part of a free choice plan is not pro-\nhibited.\"\n- 27 -\n\nschool board abdicates school assignments to the whim\nof students, the Fifth Circuit has noted that: \"In\nthe long run, it is hardly possible that schools will\nbe administered on any such haphazard basis.\"\nSingleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District.\n355 F. 2d 865, 871 (C.A. 5, 1966). See also Clark v.\nBoard of Education of the Little Rock School District,\nsupra. The guidelines provisions regarding transportation\nare designed to insure that the school system accomodates\nits transportation program to the choices it has decided\nto allow the students to make. They require only that\nif the school a student chooses or is otherwise assigned\nto because of his choice is sufficiently far from his\nhome to entitle him to transportation under the system's\ngenerally applicable rules, he must be given that\ntransportation. 45 CFR §181.51.\n\nIII. Act No. 252 conflicts with Title VI and interferes \nwith the enforcement of HEW regulations and is there-\nfore invalid under the Supremacy Clause.\nThe basic claim of the United States in this case\nis that Act No. 252 has the effect of deterring and inter-\nfering with efforts of local school boards in Alabama to\ngive and then abide by assurances that they will administer\nfederal assistance programs in compliance with §601 of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 and regulations issued pursuant\nto §602 of the Act. It is our position that Act No. 252\nis in direct conflict with Title VI and should be declared\ninvalid by this Court under the supremacy clause.\nThe conflict between the terms and the administration\nof Title VI on the one hand and Act No. 252 is not specu-\nlative or conjectural; it is plain from the face of the\nstatute and it is proven by the evidence in this case.\nFirst, Act No. 252 declares null and void the assurances\nalready given to HEW by school boards that they will\ncomply with Title VI, the Department's regulations, and\ntheir own desegregation plans. The statute goes further\nand restricts the authority of school boards to give such\nassurances in the future, although it in no way restricts\ntheir authority to receive federal funds or conduct the\nprograms for which federal assistance is available.\nThe effect of Act No. 252 upon the conduct of\nindividual school boards in Alabama nay also be determined\nfrom an analysis of the powers the statute reposes in\nthe defendants set against the defendant's conduct\nvis-a-vis the school boards both before and after the\nAct was passed. In the summer of 1965 the defendants\n- 29 -\n\nbegan an all-out assault upon the efforts of local\nschool boards to comply with Title VI and the related\nadministrative regulations. For example, in August,\n1965, the Governor and other officials informed many\nschool boards that their plans went beyond the Commis-\nsioner's minimum requirements and said:\"We think it\nwould be advisable for your school board to reconsider\n19–/\nyour action in the submission of your compliance plan.\"-\nThe Superintendent of Lauderdale County was informed by\nthe Governor that his plan to eventually eliminate all-\nNegro schools and transfer the pupils to white schools\n\"could do pore to destroy the public educational system\nof Alabama than any action since the infamous 1954 deci-\nsion of the United States Supreme Court .(cid:9) . . We call\nupon you to align your policies with the minimum require-\n/\n20\nments of the law and of court orders.\"(cid:9) The Governor's\nlegal adviser told the Sheffield district superintendent\nthat he should \"consider recalling its plan and agreement\n21/\nfrom the Office of Education.\"\nThroughout the 1965-1966 school year the defendants\nmaintained periodic contact with local school officials\non the subject of HEW compliance plans .-22 -/ In May 1966\nthe defendant Meadows recommended to several school\n19/ Govt. Exs. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.\n20/ Govt. Ex. 2.\n21/ Brewster Dep. at 24.\n22/ Govt. Exs. 5, 10, 14, 15, 22-25, 26.\n- 30 -\n\nboards that they do nothing to integrate their faculties\nand that they reconsider their assurances of compliance\n23/\nwith the guidelines.-- Repeated efforts were made by\nthe defendants, by asserting their statutory authority\nto supervise public education in Alabama, to compel\n.2A/\nschool boards to resist federal enforcement of Title VI.\nAt times cooperation with state officials was tied to  the\n25/\nreceipt of state funds.\nIt was in this climate of state-local relations\nthat the legislature adopted Act No. 252. Substantively,\nthe Act declares null and void assurances given by local\nschool boards to the Office of Education and forbids them\nfrom given further assurances in the future. The Governor\nwas designated the principal enforcer of the statute. Thus\nthe Governor's prior conduct regarding the guidelines was\ngiven new stature that had an intimidatory effect upon\nlocal school officials. Act No. 252 unmistakably made\nthe Governor the last official word on Title VI in\nAlabama, rendering each local school official subservient\nto his judgment and his demands in a way that might not\nhave been clear prior to its adoption.\n23/ Govt. Ex. 27-32.\n24/ See, e.g., Govt. Ex. 38-57; 62-65.\n25/ Govt. Exs. 11, 66, 67.\n- 31 -\n\nSoon after the adoption of Act No. 252 the\ndefendant Meadows invoked its authority to request of\nthe Tuscaloosa School Board, in the name of the public\npolicy of the State, that it reassign Negro teachers\nback to all-Negro schools. The defendants embarked upon\na pattern of conduct that made attempted compliance with\nthe guidelines, particularly on faculty desegregation, an\nact of consummate political courage. One local official\nsaid compliance would \"be breaking the law,\" another said\n26/\nthat he was \"not man enough\" to comply.-- Going further,\nthe defendant Meadows invoking the authority of state\npolicy and with the approval of Governor Wallace estab-\nlished a program of state allocation of extra teacher units\nso that white students would have a choice of white and\nNegro teachers wherever a Negro teacher was assigned to a\n27/\nwhite school.\"\nThe sum of this state-level effort, both before\nand after passage of Act No. 252, was to deny to local\nschool boards any freedom of action to deal with HEW and\nobtain federal assistance upon the terms properly required\nby federal law. This effect is apart from, but magnifies,\nwhatever negative judgments local officials might have\ncome to regarding their assurances by reason of the\nnegation of these assurances by Act No. 252.\n26/ Govt. Ex. 2, telephone calls of Pickens County Super-\nintendent to Mr. Burns of HEW and Lee County Superintendent\nto Mr. Fairley of HEW.\n27/ Govt.

It may not interfere with\nthose persons, whether public officials or otherwise, who\nare properly obligated to the federal government to take\ncertain action. Federal funds must be disbursed upon\nconditions lawfully established by federal authorities,\nand not upon conditions deemed proper by state authorities.\nWhen a State interferes with the operation of Federal law\nupon an incorrect view of the legality of that law, it\nbrings itself directly into unlawful conflict with the\nfederal law by reason of the Supremacy Clause. This con-\ncept was articulated in United States v. Allegheny County,\n322 U.S. 174,133 (1944), as follows:\n.(cid:9) .

WALLACE, Governor(cid:9) )\nof the State of Alabama, et al., )\nDefendants.\nREPLY BRIEF OF UNITED STATES \nAs we understand the principal argument of the\ndefendants, it rests on three premises:\n1. The Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964 forbid compelled racial segregation in the\npublic schools -- and nothing more.\n2. Where schools have been segregated, corrective\nL-\naction, whether judicial or administrative, should do \nmore than eliminate compulsory segregation.\n\n3. The .HEW Guidelines require the wholesale\nmixing of students to achieve racial balance.\nAs to the first and second premises, we believe\nthat the defendants' brief misconstrues the nature of\ntheir obligation under Brown and under the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964. Their obligation is not simply to desist\nfrom compelling segregation based upon race, but is\nto eliminate all aspects of racial discrimination that\ninhere in a racially-dual school system.\nAs to the third premise, the defendants misstate\nthe purpose and effect of the Guidelines. The require-\nments of the Guidelines, both on their face and as\nimplemented, relate directly to achieving compliance\nwith the mandate of the Brown decision and of Title VI\nand are not directed to achieving racial balance.\nA. The requirements of Brown and of Title VI.\nWe accept the unspoken premise underlying the\nargument of the defendants that the \"discrimination\"\nthat is forbidden by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964 is essentially the same \"discrimination\" which\nthe Supreme Court has held to be contrary to the stric-\ntures of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n2\n\nIn its first Brown decision, the Supreme Court\nheld that \"Separate educational facilities are inherently\nunequal.\" Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483,\n495 (1954).. In second Brown, the Court recognized that\nin school systems structured on the basis of racial\nsegregation a period of transition would be necessary\nto eliminate all aspects and vestiges of the dual system.\nIn determining the length of the transitional period,\nthe district courts were to be permitted to \"consider\nproblems related to administration, arising from the\nphysical condition of the school plant, the school\ntransportation system, personnel, revision of school\ndistricts and attendance areas into compact units to\nachieve a system of determining admission to public\nschools on a non-racial basis, and revision of local laws\nand regulations which may be necessary in solving the\nforegoing problems.\" Brown v. Board of Education,\n349 U.S. 294, 300-301 (1955).\nIn Brown, as in most of the early school desegre-\ngation cases, the Court was considering school systems\nthat totally compelled segregation of the races. It was,\ntherefore, natural that the language of the courts dealt\nwith \"compulsory segregation.\" Thus, the Court of\nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit, as pointed out by the\n3\n\ndefendants in their brief, frequently alluded to the\nfact that the decisions \"forbid governmentally enforced\nsegregation\" but do not \"command integration.\" See\nAvery v. Wichita Falls Independent School District,\n241 F. 2d 230, 233 (C.A. 5, 1957); Rippy v. Borders,\n250 F. 2d 690, 692 (C.A. 5, 1957); Cohen v. Public \nHousing Administration, 257 F. 2d 73, 71 (C.A. 5, 1953);\nEvers v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District,\n328 F. 2d 408 (C.A. 5, 1964).\nWhile they forbid compelled racial segregation\nin the public schools, Brown and the succeeding cases\nunquestionably do more. They forbid any discrimination\nagainst a student because of his race. With respect\nto public education, as with respect to any other govern-\nmental activity, Negroes have \"the right to stand equal\nbefore the laws of the State; that is, to be treated\nsimply as individuals without regard to race or color.\"\nBoson v. Rippy, 205 F. 2d 43, 46 (C.A. 5, 1960).\nThe Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit early\nrecognized that the mere existence of a statutory scheme\npermitting the assignment of students to schools on a\nnon-racial basis did not discharge a state's obligation\nto \"desegregate\" an already established dual system of\nschools based on race. Gibson v. Board of Public \n4\n\nInstruction of Dade County, 272 F. 2d 763 (C.A. 5, 1959).\nLater, the same Court held that even affirmative steps\nimplementing a free transfer system did not meet con-\nstitutional requirements where the underlying system\nof initial assignments based upon dual racial zones had\nnot been abolished. Augustus v. Board of Public Instruc-\ntion of Escambia County, 306 F. 2d 362 (C.A. 5, 1962).\nSee also, Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board, 303 F. 2d\n491 (C.A. 5, 1962).\nIn yet other cases, the Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit has recognized that a \"free choice\" is not\na cure-all for other elements of discrimination in a\nschool system. Thus, even before the Supreme Court\nrendered its decision in Goss v. Board of Education of \nKnoxville, 373 U.S. 683 (1963), the Court of Appeals\nheld, in a suit brought by Negro plaintiffs, that a\nschool board policy permitting white students to trans-\nfer from a school in which they were in a racial minority\nto one in which their race was a majority violated con-\nstitutional standards where the policy might \"tend to\nperpetuate racial discrimination.\" Boson v. Rippy,\nsupra, at 46.\n5\n\nJust as the Court of Appeals in Boson v. Rippy,\nsupra, anticipated the ruling of the Supreme Court in\nGoss regarding the minority transfer rule, so also did\nthe Court of Appeals in Board of Public Instruction of \nDuval County v. Braxton, 326 F. 2d 616 (C.A. 5, 1964),\nanticipate the ruling of the Supreme Court regarding\nfaculty segregation. In Bradley v. School Board of \nRichmond, 332 U.S. 103 (1965) and Rogers v. Paul,\n382. U.S. 198, (1965) the Supreme Court held that the\nracial segregation of faculty has sufficient bearing\nupon the right of the Negro student to a non-racial\neducation, that the student has legal standing to seek\ninjunctive relief against continuation of the practice.\nUnder the above decisions, the test of consti-\ntutionality is not simply whether Negroes are compelled \nto attend schools attended solely by members of their\nown race. The test is whether the state is using or\nhas used racial distinctions in the operation of the\npublic schools in such a manner that the Negro students\ndo not, in the language of Boson, \"stand equal before\nthe laws of the state.\" In short, the question here\nis not whether Negroes in Alabama are being compelled\n6\n\nby the defendants to attend all-Negro schools, but wheth-\ner the defendants have participated and are participating\nin the planning or maintenance of schools, transportation,\nor other educational services for Negroes in such a way\nas to denote their inferiority or to deprive them of an\nequal educational opportunity,\nThe language of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals\nin a somewhat similar situation is pertinent. In reject-\ning a contention that it was constitutionally permissible\nfor the Railroad Terminal station in Birmingham to main-\ntain separate waiting rooms for white and Negro passengers,\nso long as segregated use of those waiting rooms was not\nenforced, the Court saidt\nWhat is forbidden is the state action in which\ncolor (i.e., race) is the determinant. It is\nsimply beyond the constitutional competence\nof the state to command that any facility\neither shall be labeled as or reserved for\nthe exclusive or preferred use of one rather\nthan the other of the races.\nThis is not to say that integration in\nall activities must be governmentally com-\npelled, We, and others, have clearly indi-\ncated to the contrary. Cit e of Mont\nAlabama v. Gilmore, 5 Cir., 1960, 277 F. 2d\n364, at page 369 and notes 5 and 6. But the\nState may not either compel segregation in\nuse or the maintenance or making of separate\nfacilities where the criteria is race or\ncolor. Baldwin v. Morgan, 287 F. 2d 750,\n754 (C.A. 5, 1961).\n7\n\nSimilarly, the State of Alabama may not constitu-\ntionally plan, locate or maintain schools for Negroes as\nNegroes - except, as we shall hereinafter discuss, to\ncorrect the effects of the existing dual system\nB. Corrective Action\nda\nThe brief of the defendants fails to distinguish\nbetween an obligation to discontinue an unconstitutional\npractice carried on in good faith unde] the doctrine of\nPies= v. Ferguson, 163 U: S. 537 (1895, and the obliga-\ntion to take affirmative steps to disestablish an uncon-\nstitutional system that has been preserved and maintained\non a statewide basis Lo:: twelve years in open and de-\nliberate violation of federal law. This distinction, we\nbelieve, is vital in this case.\nEve: where there has been good faith, the dis-\nestablishment of an existing dual system may require more\nthan the passive discontinuance of discriminatory action.\nIn one sense, the officials of a segregated school\nsystem cease their discriminatory practices when they\ncommence assigning all new students and newly-employed\nteachers to particular schools without regard to race.\n-(cid:9) 4.7 ■•••\n\nSuch officils can say that they are doing as much, and\nshould be required to do no more, than are similar\nofficials in school districts that have never had a\nracially segregated system, Clearly, however, this would\nnot be sufficient either in logic, in fairness, or under\nthe decisions of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Cir-\ncuit and of the Supreme Court. Assignments of ta-chers\nand students already made would conttnue unless affirma-\ntive steps were taken to undo them. :-Tepending on the\nfacts of the particular case, the same might be true\nas to bus routes, athletic schedules, and the location\nof school sites and facilities. The official decision,\nin these areas, having been racially oriented in the past,\nhave an effect that will continue unless corrected. And\ncorrective action may well require that some consideration\nbe given to race.\nThe necessity of considering race in correcting\nracial discrimination and its effects has been recognized\nby the Court of Appeals for this Circuit.\nIn a rflcentec:ision, the Court of Appeals looked\nto race in determining how effective the free choice plan\nof the Mobile, Alabama, school system had been in effec-\nting desegregation. L'avis v. Board of School C3mmissioners\nof Mobile, Alabama, 364 F. 2d 396 (C.A. 5, 1966).\n- 9 -\n\nIn noting the factors that led it to conclude that the\n2ree choice plan was not operating effectively to elimi-\nnate the maintenance of separate schools upon the basis\nof race, the Court said:\nPrincipal among these is the fact that\neven as to those grades which, under the\nplan actually become \"desegregated\"4,--\nthere is no true substance in the alleged\ndesegregation. Less than two-tenths of\none percent of the Negro children in the\nsystem are attending white schools.\n364 F. 2d 396, at 901\nNot only may a chool board, and perforce a\ndistrict court, look to race in determining whether the\ndual system of schools is being effectively eliminated,\nbut racial considerations may also be employed in correc-\nting the dual system. In Wanner v. Co7anty School Board \nof Arlington County, Virginia, 357 F. 2d 452, the lower\ncourt had enjoined school authorities from closing a\ntraditionally all-Negro high school and transfering the\nNegro students to traditionally white high schools upon\nthe ground that their action was based upon racial con-\nsiderations. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit,\nin reversing, said:\nIt would be stultifying to hold that a board\nmay not move to undo arrangements artificially\ncontrived to effect or maintain segregation)\non the ground that this interference with\nthe status quo would involve \"consideration\nof race.\" When school authorities, recognizing\n- 10 -\n\nthe historic fact that existing conditions\nare based on a design to segregate the\nraces, act to undo these illegal condi-\ntions - especially conditions that have\nbeen judicially condemned - their effort\nis not to be frustrated on the ground that\nrace is not a permissible consideration.\nThis is not the \"consideration of race\"\nwhich the Constitution discountenances.\n357 F. ^d, at 454\nIn the recently .{decided case of Board of Education \nof the  Oklahoma City Plinio Schools v. Dowell, (cid:9)  F. -)d\n(C.A. 10, No. :J53, decided January 73, 1967), the\nCourt of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit was urged to revers\nthe decision of listrict Judge Bohannon in Cowell v. Board \nof Education of the Oklahoma City Public Schools, 244\nF. Supp. 971 MD. Okla., l965), requiring school auth-\norities to permit students to transfer from schools in\nw ich their race was in the majority to schools in which\ntheir race was in the minority, and rewiring the consoli-\ndation of certain traditionally all-Negro schools with\ncertain traditionally all-white schools under the so-called\n\"Princeton Plan.\" The Court of Appeals, in affirming the\nDistrict Court order in these particulars, held that it\nwas appropriate to require the school authorities to give\naffect to racial factors in order to overcorce the effects\nof the past discriminatory system. In response to the\n\nargument that such action compelled integration rather\nthan merely requiring desegregation, Circuit Judge Lewis,\nconcurring specially, said:\nhave no quarrel with the statement\nthat forced integration when viewed as an\nend in itself is not a compulsion of the\nFourteenth Amendment. But any claimed\nright to disassociation in the public\nschools must fail and fall. If desegre-\ngation of the races is to he accomplished\nin the public schools, forced association\nmust result, not as the end sought but as\nthe path to elimination of discrimination.\nAnd, to me, the argument that racial dis-\ncriminat :_on cannot be eliminated through\nfactors of judicial consideration that are\nbased upon race itself is completely self-\ndenying. The rroblem arose through con-\nsideration of race; it may now he approached\nthrough similar but enlightened consideration.\nAgain noting that the case reaches us\nfor review of the affirmative action of the\ntrial court it seems proper to emphasize\nthat we do not set out consolidation of\nschools and the majority-to-minority transfer\npolicy as compulsive instruents to accom-\nplish desegregation. But we do hold that\nsuch means are not violative of the con-\nstitutional rights of any and might properly\nhave been utilized by the School Board, and,\nin its stead, were availale to the trial\ncourt. Tie contrasting policy of minority-\nto-majority transfer, denied in Goss,\nperpetuated discrimination; here, a start\nis made toward full compliance with Brown.\nThe factor of race can no more he ignored in\nabolishing the dual system in Alabama than in Ullahoma.\nThe real objection of the defendants, however, as we see\nit, is not to consiCering the race of the students and\n\nteachers during the disestablishment of the dual system;\ntheir objection is to being required to take any affirma-\ntive steps whatever to disestablish that system. Yet,\nthis Court has already, in its order of July 13, 196'1,\nenjoined the defendant state officials from:\nFailing, in the exercise of its control\nand supervision over the public schools of\nthe State, to use such control and super-\nvision in such a manner as to nromote and\nencourage the elimination of racial dis-\ncrimination in the public schools, rather\nthan to prevent and discourage the elimi-\nnation of such discrimination.\nDespite this order, the de:fendants by their own admission\nhave done nothing to disestablish the dual system in\nAlabama. They continue to plan, propose and approve school\nconstruction upon the basis of the race of the students\nintended to be served; they still establish ,;nd fix\nattendance areas for junior colleges and trade schools\nion the Lasis of race; they still subsidize and encourage\nthe operation of local school transportation systeps on a\nracial basis, and they officially discourage the desegre-\ngation of teaching staffs.\n-- 13 -\n\nC. The Guidelines Do Not Require Racial Balance \nIn their attempt to discredit the Guidelines the\ndefendants say the Guidelines require the establishment\nof racial balance. We have already pointed out in our\nprevious brief that such an interpretation does violence\nto the language of the Guidelines. The defendants now\nattempt to make their point by referring to the admin-\nistrative practice. Pages 33 through 42 of the defendants'\nbrief purport to set forth interpretations of the Guide-\nlines by the Commissioner of Education. These interpre-\ntations need not be discussed, except to point out that\nthey are the defendants' interpretations and not the\nCommissioner's.(cid:9) The depositions of both Mr. Howe\nand Mr. Crowder, for example, explicitly deny any plan\nor attempt to establish racial balance or proportions as\na requirement for receivin federal fundsli and the\nfollowing illustration from the bottom of page 34 of\ndefendants' brief is noted to show that the import of\nthe testimony is not always clearly stated:\nMr. Howe testified ... that if such transfers\nof both students and faculty, or either, were\nnot attained [that would be one element in a\n1 / See Howe Dep., pp.(cid:9) 67, 77-79, and Crowder Dep.,\nPP . 27, 33•\n- 14 -\n\n/\ndecision]–  (a) to defer federal funds, and\n(b) to set up a hearing leading to the(cid:9) termina-\ntion of federal funds.\nAlso, on pages 41 and 42 there is a list of 15 actions\nwhich defendants state the United States Commissioner of\nEducation will compel local school officials to take in\norder to promote integration, although Mr. Howe in his\ntestimony emphatically denied any such intention.\nD. The Further Contentions of the Defendants Are \nWithout Merit.\nThe defendants reiterate in Part VI of their brief\ntheir contention that the guidelines conflict with certain\nlimiting provisions of Titles IV, VI, and VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964. The contentions regarding Title IV\nand VI were dealt with in the Government's main brief in\nthis case, at pp. 20-28 and also in the Court's opinion\nin United States v. Jefferson County Board of Education,\nC. A. 5, No. 23345 (decided December 29, 1966).\nRegarding Title VII, the defendants appear to argue\nthat the exclusion of state employment from coverage\nunder the fair employment provisions of the Civil Rights\nAct bars the Commissioner from re quiring faculty desegre-\ngation in his enforcement of Title VI. The argument must\n2 / The bracketed testimony from the deposition was\nomitted and \"he would take steps\" was irserted in defend-\nants summary of the testimony.\n- 15 -\n\nfail for the same reason that the contention regarding\nsection 604 of the Act must fail (see Brief of the United\nStates at 20-23) - i.e., faculty(cid:9) segregation is not\nso much an employment practice as it is a device for per-\npetuating the segregation of students in violation of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment and section 601.\nThe defendants argue further in Parts VIA, and VII\nof their brief that the guidelines are contrary to sec-\ntion 604 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act,\n20 USC §884, which declares that nothing contained in\nthat Act shall be construed to authorize federal control\nover the curriculum, program of instruction, administra-\ntion, personnel of any school. First, it is difficult\nto understand why a limitation specifically applicable\nto one statute should be read as a limitation on action\ntaken pursuant to an entirely different statute. Second,\nexcept insofar as racial factors are involved the guide-\nlines do not touch upon any of the areas barred to the\nCommissioner by §604 of the Elementary and Secondary\nEducation Act. Lastly, the entire enforcement scheme\nof Title VI necessarily generates federal scrutiny of\nall practices which conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment\nand are now routinely dealt with in Court orders. In\nthat sense the \"federal involvement\" derives from the\nConstitution and not an Act of Congress or executive\nadministration. Indeed, if §604 of the Education Act is\nread so as to immunize such factors as faculty segregation,\n- 16 -\n\ninitial racial assignment of students and racially\noriented transportation from federal scrutiny prior to\nthe granting of federal funds, that immunity itself would\nbe of doubtful constitutionality. Cf. Simkins v. Moses H.\nCone Hospital, 323 F.2d 959 (C.A. 4, 1963).3/\nAlthough they argue that the guidelines are not\n\"law\" and are akin to revenue rulings of the Internal\nRevenue Service, the defendants assert that they are\ninvalid because the President did not formally approve\nthem. We treated this question in our main brief (see\nBrief of the United States at 6-8), but we note in addi-\ntion that the defendants can point to no legislative history\nindicating that Congress expected the President, rather\nthan the Office of Education, to determine what particular\naction non-complying school systems would have to take\nunder Title VI, or that the President should review the\nCommissioner's determinations in that regard. What is\nclear is that decision of the designated rule-maker, here\nthe Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, to sub-\ndelegate the particular definition of standards to another\n3 / The restriction of §6o4 of the Elementary and Secon-\ndary Education Act is not as absolute as the defendants\nsuggest. Under §205(a) of the Act, 20 USC §241e(a),\nState agency approval of local projects must be \"consistent\nwith such basic criteria as the Commissioner may establish\"\nand the Commissioner's regulations deal with such specifics\nas the size and geographic reach of a project, eligibility\nof children for participation in a project, use of funds\nfor school construction, and procedures for evaluating the\neffectiveness of individual programs. 45 CFR §§ 116.17-\n116.22. Thus the precise impact of §604 is to reserve\nto the local agencies complete autonomy from federal regula-\ntion except insofar as that regulation is authorized by\nthe Education Act itself.\n- 17 -\n\nofficer would have to be approved by the President. Here\nit was because the subdelegation is spelled out in the\nHEW regulation itself. See 45 CFR §80.4(c).\nIt is important to emphasize that each requirement\nof the guidelines is subject to administrative challenge\nby any school system on grounds of hardship, inappli-\ncability, or invalidity as applied to it and a hearing\nofficer in a §602 proceeding may properly determine it\nshould not apply. The regulations are another matter;\nthere both the hearing officer and the Secretary must\napply them as controlling law in the absence of changes\nin the regulations. This administrative leeway in apply-\ning the guidelines, reflecting as it does their advisory\nnature, parallels the approach taken by the Fifth Circuit\nin the Jefferson County case in its adoption of the\nguidelines as judicial standards under the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Under that decision, an individual school\nboard may show why the generally applicable standards\nought not apply to it. See United States v. Jefferson\nCounty Board of Education, slip opinion at 111-112.\nThe defendants argue vigorously that the guidelines\nhave no legal force of their own and are not valid if\nthey are contrary to any statute or constitutional pro-\nvision (Defendants' Brief at 43-46). We entirely agree.\nThey are the Commissioner's view of the standards school\nboards must meet to obtain federal funds. To the extent\nthat they are contrary to any Act of Congress or the HEW\nregulations, they should be given no effect. However,\n- 1: -\n\nwe have tried to show throughout our main brief, and\nagain here, that no such conflict exists.\nIn Part VIII of their brief, the defendants chal-\nlenge anew the assurance requirement of the HEW regulations\nand they argue that the Commissioner may not lawfully\ndeny federal funds to an applicant who refuses to file\nan assurance but who nonetheless is in compliance with\nthe guidelines or a court order.\nIn our main brief we sought to demonstrate the\npropriety of the assurance requirement (Brief of the Unf.ted\nStates at 8-12). The defendants now argue that by filing\nassurances local boards somehow bargain away their govern-\nmental obligations and unlawfully bind their successors\nin office to courses of action they should be free to\navoid. But so long as boards receive federal funds, they\nare bound by the general nondiscrimination requirements\nof §601, and whether they receive federal funds or not\nthey are bound by the Fourteenth Amendment. If the\nassurances simply relate to what school boards must do\nanyway, and we believe that is the only effect of the\nassurances, they operate to enforce governmental obliga-\ntions rather than to vitiate them. Further, it is\ncommonplace for public agencies to enter into obligations\nbinding on successors. If they could not, continuity\nin government could not be sustained. Any future board\nis always free to rescind an assurance and forfeit the\n\nfuture receipt of funds, but insofar as particular\ncapital improvements or continuing programs reflect on-\ngoing federal aid, successor boards cannot and ought\nnot be able to avoid the non-discrimination commitments\n/\nof their predecessors.\nThe defendants further challenge the legality of\nfund termination where the recipient is in compliance\nwith required standards but refuses to submit an assurance.\nThe situation is implausible; if the recipient is in\nbona fide compliance, why would he refuse to file an\nassurance that this is and will continue to be the case?\nSo long as the assurance is a proper technique of\n4 / There is no basis for applying the principles quoted\nby the defendants at pp. 61-66 of their brief to in-\nvalidate the assurance requirement of the HEW regulation.\nEach of the State court cases quoted by the defendants\ninvolved a contract between a public agency and a private\nindividual in which, as payment for goods or services to\nbe provided by the private individual, the public agency\nbargained away some aspect of its governing' discretion.\nIn Gale v. Village of Kalamazoo, 23 Mich. 344, the village\ntrustees promised not to authorize the building of a\npublic market over a ten•year period in consideration of\nthe plaintiff's construction of a market; in McCortle v.\nBates, 29 Ohio St. 419, a majority of a board of education\ncontracted to approve a purchase at their next meeting\nas a board; in Leidigh v. Nebraska City, 138 Neb. 136\n(1940), city officers extended the credit of the city\nbeyond their terms of office in violation of state public\npolicy; and in Shores v. Elmore County Board of Education,\n3 S.2d 14 (Ala. Sup. Ct., 1942), the Alabama school laws\nwere construed to prohibit the making of contracts with\nbus drivers which extended beyond the term of the incumbent\nSuperintendent. Thus the cases turned on the nature of\neach public office as a matter of state law, and their\nrelevance to relations between a state agency and the\nFederal government acting pursuant to an Act of Congress\nis no where made clear by the defendants.\n- 20 -\n\nadministration, its requirement may be enforced by the\nagency that chooses to use it. If it is concluded that\nassurances ought to be filed, receipt of funds may pro-\nperly be conditioned upon the meeting of that procedural\nrequirement. There is no reason for the Commissioners\nto assume that an applicant who refuses to file an assurance\nwill, in good faith, maintain a status of compliance if\nhe refuses to assure the Commissioner that he will do\njust that, even if at the time of the refusal to assure\nhe is in fact complying.5/\nIn Parts IX and X of their brief the defendants\nargue that there is no basis for entering a declaratory\njudgment in this case. Their position is that if the\nguidelines and the assurance requirement are valid, then\nAct No. 252 has no effect. But the issue raised in the\nGovernment's complaint is whether Act No. 252 is valid,\nnot whether the guidelines are valf_d. Our pre-trial\nbrief argued that the subject matter of Act No. 252\nwas beyond the competence of the Alabama legislature,\nwhatever the partial or total invalidity of the guide-\nlines as a matter of federal law. It now appears to be\nconceded by all that the question of the validity of\n5 / \nThe defendants' further assertion that Commissioner\narrogates to himself the authority to require more than\nthe terms of court orders which are submitted in lieu of\ndesegregation plans is without substance (Defendants'\nBrief at 49). There is no evidence in this case that\nCommissioner has ever rejected a court order as insuf-\nficient, and although a plainly inadequate order can pro-\nvide no refuge from the requirements of Title VI,\nthere is no occasion for this Court to consider in the\nabstract the possibility of administrative rejection of\nany particular order.\n- 21 -\n\nAct No. 252 will turn on the validity of the guidelines,\nbut it does not follow that the guidelines question is\nthe sole pivot upon which the Court's decision must\ndepend.\nWe agree that if the guidelines are valid, Act\nNo. 252 has no residual effect. But the issues are in\nlitigation because they will not resolve themselves,\nand the vehicle for resolving them is this lawsuit to\ndetermine whether Act No. 252 conflicts and interferes\nwith basic federal law. Act No. 252 will not disappear\nas a result of this Court expressing a view that the\nguidelines are valid. The question is whether the state\nand local officials beholden to the statute understand,\nwithout being told by this Court, that if the guidelines\nare valid Act No. 252 is a nullity. We have shown in\nour main brief at pp. 29-3)4 that Act No. 252 had a sub-\nstantial impact upon school administration in Alabama.\nThe Court should not assume that the supremacy of federal\nlaw is so well understood by school officials in Alabama\nthat a decision limited to the issues raised only in\nthe defendants' counterclaim regarding the validity of\nthe guidelines would suffice to accomplish the objectives\nof the Government's main suit, should the Court fail to\ndeclare Act No. 252 invalid. Indeed, if Act No. 252\nought not be declared invalid even if the guidelines are\nsustained, the Court's jurisdiction over the Government's\nclaim falls. Since it is doubtful whether the state-\nlevel defendants may independently raise all the issues\n- 22 -\n\nregarding the guidelines contained in their counterclaim4–/\na decision which validated the guidelines but which fell\nshort of declaring Act No. 252 invalid would itself be\nsubject to jurisdictional challenge, even if the parties\nagreed to this cause.\nThe defendants in Part X of their brief characterize\nAct No. 252 as dealing only with the authority of local\nschool boards to accept federal funds. The characteriza-\ntion is inaccurate. The statute is addressed to the\nconditions that attach to the receipt of federal funds,\nand not to their receipt itself. Alabama may, for valid\ngovernmental reasons, reorganize its educational-system\nso as to withdraw from local school boards the author-\nity to receive federal funds, but it has not done so\nby the enactment of Act No. 252. Instead, it purports\nto establish what obligations the school boards undertake\nwhen they receive the funds, and, premised on a judgment re-\ngarding the legality of the guidelines, the Act restricts the\nobligations school officials may undertake in the future.\n6 / \nThe counterclaim challenging the guidelines was filed\nonly in the names of the state-level defendants. The\nTuscaloosa officials, who are sued here only by the pri-\nvate plaintiffs, have no pending claim against the United\nStates or the private plaintiffs.\n- 23 -\n\nThus the Act operates so as to interfere with the\nenforcement of Title VI in Alabahla for no reason justi-\nfiable in terms of the state's legitimate interests.\nIt should therefore be declared unconstitutional by this\n7/\nCourt. \nRespectfully submitted,\nJOHN DOAR\nAssistant Attorney General\nST.

WALLACE, Governor(cid:9) )\nof the State of Alabama, et al., )\nDefendants.\nREPLY BRIEF OF UNITED STATES \nAs we understand the principal argument of the\ndefendants, it rests on three premises:\n1. The Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964 forbid compelled racial segregation in the\npublic schools -- and nothing more.\n2. Where schools have been segregated, corrective\nL-\naction, whether judicial or administrative, should do \nmore than eliminate compulsory segregation.\n\n3. The .HEW Guidelines require the wholesale\nmixing of students to achieve racial balance.\nAs to the first and second premises, we believe\nthat the defendants' brief misconstrues the nature of\ntheir obligation under Brown and under the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964. Their obligation is not simply to desist\nfrom compelling segregation based upon race, but is\nto eliminate all aspects of racial discrimination that\ninhere in a racially-dual school system.\nAs to the third premise, the defendants misstate\nthe purpose and effect of the Guidelines. The require-\nments of the Guidelines, both on their face and as\nimplemented, relate directly to achieving compliance\nwith the mandate of the Brown decision and of Title VI\nand are not directed to achieving racial balance.\nA. The requirements of Brown and of Title VI.\nWe accept the unspoken premise underlying the\nargument of the defendants that the \"discrimination\"\nthat is forbidden by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964 is essentially the same \"discrimination\" which\nthe Supreme Court has held to be contrary to the stric-\ntures of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n2\n\nIn its first Brown decision, the Supreme Court\nheld that \"Separate educational facilities are inherently\nunequal.\" Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483,\n495 (1954).. In second Brown, the Court recognized that\nin school systems structured on the basis of racial\nsegregation a period of transition would be necessary\nto eliminate all aspects and vestiges of the dual system.\nIn determining the length of the transitional period,\nthe district courts were to be permitted to \"consider\nproblems related to administration, arising from the\nphysical condition of the school plant, the school\ntransportation system, personnel, revision of school\ndistricts and attendance areas into compact units to\nachieve a system of determining admission to public\nschools on a non-racial basis, and revision of local laws\nand regulations which may be necessary in solving the\nforegoing problems.\" Brown v. Board of Education,\n349 U.S. 294, 300-301 (1955).\nIn Brown, as in most of the early school desegre-\ngation cases, the Court was considering school systems\nthat totally compelled segregation of the races. It was,\ntherefore, natural that the language of the courts dealt\nwith \"compulsory segregation.\" Thus, the Court of\nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit, as pointed out by the\n3\n\ndefendants in their brief, frequently alluded to the\nfact that the decisions \"forbid governmentally enforced\nsegregation\" but do not \"command integration.\" See\nAvery v. Wichita Falls Independent School District,\n241 F. 2d 230, 233 (C.A. 5, 1957); Rippy v. Borders,\n250 F. 2d 690, 692 (C.A. 5, 1957); Cohen v. Public \nHousing Administration, 257 F. 2d 73, 71 (C.A. 5, 1953);\nEvers v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District,\n328 F. 2d 408 (C.A. 5, 1964).\nWhile they forbid compelled racial segregation\nin the public schools, Brown and the succeeding cases\nunquestionably do more. They forbid any discrimination\nagainst a student because of his race. With respect\nto public education, as with respect to any other govern-\nmental activity, Negroes have \"the right to stand equal\nbefore the laws of the State; that is, to be treated\nsimply as individuals without regard to race or color.\"\nBoson v. Rippy, 205 F. 2d 43, 46 (C.A. 5, 1960).\nThe Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit early\nrecognized that the mere existence of a statutory scheme\npermitting the assignment of students to schools on a\nnon-racial basis did not discharge a state's obligation\nto \"desegregate\" an already established dual system of\nschools based on race. Gibson v. Board of Public \n4\n\nInstruction of Dade County, 272 F. 2d 763 (C.A. 5, 1959).\nLater, the same Court held that even affirmative steps\nimplementing a free transfer system did not meet con-\nstitutional requirements where the underlying system\nof initial assignments based upon dual racial zones had\nnot been abolished. Augustus v. Board of Public Instruc-\ntion of Escambia County, 306 F. 2d 362 (C.A. 5, 1962).\nSee also, Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board, 303 F. 2d\n491 (C.A. 5, 1962).\nIn yet other cases, the Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit has recognized that a \"free choice\" is not\na cure-all for other elements of discrimination in a\nschool system. Thus, even before the Supreme Court\nrendered its decision in Goss v. Board of Education of \nKnoxville, 373 U.S. 683 (1963), the Court of Appeals\nheld, in a suit brought by Negro plaintiffs, that a\nschool board policy permitting white students to trans-\nfer from a school in which they were in a racial minority\nto one in which their race was a majority violated con-\nstitutional standards where the policy might \"tend to\nperpetuate racial discrimination.\" Boson v. Rippy,\nsupra, at 46.\n5\n\nJust as the Court of Appeals in Boson v. Rippy,\nsupra, anticipated the ruling of the Supreme Court in\nGoss regarding the minority transfer rule, so also did\nthe Court of Appeals in Board of Public Instruction of \nDuval County v. Braxton, 326 F. 2d 616 (C.A. 5, 1964),\nanticipate the ruling of the Supreme Court regarding\nfaculty segregation. In Bradley v. School Board of \nRichmond, 332 U.S. 103 (1965) and Rogers v. Paul,\n382. U.S. 198, (1965) the Supreme Court held that the\nracial segregation of faculty has sufficient bearing\nupon the right of the Negro student to a non-racial\neducation, that the student has legal standing to seek\ninjunctive relief against continuation of the practice.\nUnder the above decisions, the test of consti-\ntutionality is not simply whether Negroes are compelled \nto attend schools attended solely by members of their\nown race. The test is whether the state is using or\nhas used racial distinctions in the operation of the\npublic schools in such a manner that the Negro students\ndo not, in the language of Boson, \"stand equal before\nthe laws of the state.\" In short, the question here\nis not whether Negroes in Alabama are being compelled\n6\n\nby the defendants to attend all-Negro schools, but wheth-\ner the defendants have participated and are participating\nin the planning or maintenance of schools, transportation,\nor other educational services for Negroes in such a way\nas to denote their inferiority or to deprive them of an\nequal educational opportunity,\nThe language of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals\nin a somewhat similar situation is pertinent. In reject-\ning a contention that it was constitutionally permissible\nfor the Railroad Terminal station in Birmingham to main-\ntain separate waiting rooms for white and Negro passengers,\nso long as segregated use of those waiting rooms was not\nenforced, the Court saidt\nWhat is forbidden is the state action in which\ncolor (i.e., race) is the determinant. It is\nsimply beyond the constitutional competence\nof the state to command that any facility\neither shall be labeled as or reserved for\nthe exclusive or preferred use of one rather\nthan the other of the races.\nThis is not to say that integration in\nall activities must be governmentally com-\npelled, We, and others, have clearly indi-\ncated to the contrary. Cit e of Mont\nAlabama v. Gilmore, 5 Cir., 1960, 277 F. 2d\n364, at page 369 and notes 5 and 6. But the\nState may not either compel segregation in\nuse or the maintenance or making of separate\nfacilities where the criteria is race or\ncolor. Baldwin v. Morgan, 287 F. 2d 750,\n754 (C.A. 5, 1961).\n7\n\nSimilarly, the State of Alabama may not constitu-\ntionally plan, locate or maintain schools for Negroes as\nNegroes - except, as we shall hereinafter discuss, to\ncorrect the effects of the existing dual system\nB. Corrective Action\nda\nThe brief of the defendants fails to distinguish\nbetween an obligation to discontinue an unconstitutional\npractice carried on in good faith unde] the doctrine of\nPies= v. Ferguson, 163 U: S. 537 (1895, and the obliga-\ntion to take affirmative steps to disestablish an uncon-\nstitutional system that has been preserved and maintained\non a statewide basis Lo:: twelve years in open and de-\nliberate violation of federal law. This distinction, we\nbelieve, is vital in this case.\nEve: where there has been good faith, the dis-\nestablishment of an existing dual system may require more\nthan the passive discontinuance of discriminatory action.\nIn one sense, the officials of a segregated school\nsystem cease their discriminatory practices when they\ncommence assigning all new students and newly-employed\nteachers to particular schools without regard to race.\n-(cid:9) 4.7 ■•••\n\nSuch officils can say that they are doing as much, and\nshould be required to do no more, than are similar\nofficials in school districts that have never had a\nracially segregated system, Clearly, however, this would\nnot be sufficient either in logic, in fairness, or under\nthe decisions of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Cir-\ncuit and of the Supreme Court. Assignments of ta-chers\nand students already made would conttnue unless affirma-\ntive steps were taken to undo them. :-Tepending on the\nfacts of the particular case, the same might be true\nas to bus routes, athletic schedules, and the location\nof school sites and facilities. The official decision,\nin these areas, having been racially oriented in the past,\nhave an effect that will continue unless corrected. And\ncorrective action may well require that some consideration\nbe given to race.\nThe necessity of considering race in correcting\nracial discrimination and its effects has been recognized\nby the Court of Appeals for this Circuit.\nIn a rflcentec:ision, the Court of Appeals looked\nto race in determining how effective the free choice plan\nof the Mobile, Alabama, school system had been in effec-\nting desegregation. L'avis v. Board of School C3mmissioners\nof Mobile, Alabama, 364 F. 2d 396 (C.A. 5, 1966).\n- 9 -\n\nIn noting the factors that led it to conclude that the\n2ree choice plan was not operating effectively to elimi-\nnate the maintenance of separate schools upon the basis\nof race, the Court said:\nPrincipal among these is the fact that\neven as to those grades which, under the\nplan actually become \"desegregated\"4,--\nthere is no true substance in the alleged\ndesegregation. Less than two-tenths of\none percent of the Negro children in the\nsystem are attending white schools.\n364 F. 2d 396, at 901\nNot only may a chool board, and perforce a\ndistrict court, look to race in determining whether the\ndual system of schools is being effectively eliminated,\nbut racial considerations may also be employed in correc-\nting the dual system. In Wanner v. Co7anty School Board \nof Arlington County, Virginia, 357 F. 2d 452, the lower\ncourt had enjoined school authorities from closing a\ntraditionally all-Negro high school and transfering the\nNegro students to traditionally white high schools upon\nthe ground that their action was based upon racial con-\nsiderations. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit,\nin reversing, said:\nIt would be stultifying to hold that a board\nmay not move to undo arrangements artificially\ncontrived to effect or maintain segregation)\non the ground that this interference with\nthe status quo would involve \"consideration\nof race.\" When school authorities, recognizing\n- 10 -\n\nthe historic fact that existing conditions\nare based on a design to segregate the\nraces, act to undo these illegal condi-\ntions - especially conditions that have\nbeen judicially condemned - their effort\nis not to be frustrated on the ground that\nrace is not a permissible consideration.\nThis is not the \"consideration of race\"\nwhich the Constitution discountenances.\n357 F. ^d, at 454\nIn the recently .{decided case of Board of Education \nof the  Oklahoma City Plinio Schools v. Dowell, (cid:9)  F. -)d\n(C.A. 10, No. :J53, decided January 73, 1967), the\nCourt of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit was urged to revers\nthe decision of listrict Judge Bohannon in Cowell v. Board \nof Education of the Oklahoma City Public Schools, 244\nF. Supp. 971 MD. Okla., l965), requiring school auth-\norities to permit students to transfer from schools in\nw ich their race was in the majority to schools in which\ntheir race was in the minority, and rewiring the consoli-\ndation of certain traditionally all-Negro schools with\ncertain traditionally all-white schools under the so-called\n\"Princeton Plan.\" The Court of Appeals, in affirming the\nDistrict Court order in these particulars, held that it\nwas appropriate to require the school authorities to give\naffect to racial factors in order to overcorce the effects\nof the past discriminatory system. In response to the\n\nargument that such action compelled integration rather\nthan merely requiring desegregation, Circuit Judge Lewis,\nconcurring specially, said:\nhave no quarrel with the statement\nthat forced integration when viewed as an\nend in itself is not a compulsion of the\nFourteenth Amendment. But any claimed\nright to disassociation in the public\nschools must fail and fall. If desegre-\ngation of the races is to he accomplished\nin the public schools, forced association\nmust result, not as the end sought but as\nthe path to elimination of discrimination.\nAnd, to me, the argument that racial dis-\ncriminat :_on cannot be eliminated through\nfactors of judicial consideration that are\nbased upon race itself is completely self-\ndenying. The rroblem arose through con-\nsideration of race; it may now he approached\nthrough similar but enlightened consideration.\nAgain noting that the case reaches us\nfor review of the affirmative action of the\ntrial court it seems proper to emphasize\nthat we do not set out consolidation of\nschools and the majority-to-minority transfer\npolicy as compulsive instruents to accom-\nplish desegregation. But we do hold that\nsuch means are not violative of the con-\nstitutional rights of any and might properly\nhave been utilized by the School Board, and,\nin its stead, were availale to the trial\ncourt. Tie contrasting policy of minority-\nto-majority transfer, denied in Goss,\nperpetuated discrimination; here, a start\nis made toward full compliance with Brown.\nThe factor of race can no more he ignored in\nabolishing the dual system in Alabama than in Ullahoma.\nThe real objection of the defendants, however, as we see\nit, is not to consiCering the race of the students and\n\nteachers during the disestablishment of the dual system;\ntheir objection is to being required to take any affirma-\ntive steps whatever to disestablish that system. Yet,\nthis Court has already, in its order of July 13, 196'1,\nenjoined the defendant state officials from:\nFailing, in the exercise of its control\nand supervision over the public schools of\nthe State, to use such control and super-\nvision in such a manner as to nromote and\nencourage the elimination of racial dis-\ncrimination in the public schools, rather\nthan to prevent and discourage the elimi-\nnation of such discrimination.\nDespite this order, the de:fendants by their own admission\nhave done nothing to disestablish the dual system in\nAlabama. They continue to plan, propose and approve school\nconstruction upon the basis of the race of the students\nintended to be served; they still establish ,;nd fix\nattendance areas for junior colleges and trade schools\nion the Lasis of race; they still subsidize and encourage\nthe operation of local school transportation systeps on a\nracial basis, and they officially discourage the desegre-\ngation of teaching staffs.\n-- 13 -\n\nC. The Guidelines Do Not Require Racial Balance \nIn their attempt to discredit the Guidelines the\ndefendants say the Guidelines require the establishment\nof racial balance. We have already pointed out in our\nprevious brief that such an interpretation does violence\nto the language of the Guidelines. The defendants now\nattempt to make their point by referring to the admin-\nistrative practice. Pages 33 through 42 of the defendants'\nbrief purport to set forth interpretations of the Guide-\nlines by the Commissioner of Education. These interpre-\ntations need not be discussed, except to point out that\nthey are the defendants' interpretations and not the\nCommissioner's.(cid:9) The depositions of both Mr. Howe\nand Mr. Crowder, for example, explicitly deny any plan\nor attempt to establish racial balance or proportions as\na requirement for receivin federal fundsli and the\nfollowing illustration from the bottom of page 34 of\ndefendants' brief is noted to show that the import of\nthe testimony is not always clearly stated:\nMr. Howe testified ... that if such transfers\nof both students and faculty, or either, were\nnot attained [that would be one element in a\n1 / See Howe Dep., pp.(cid:9) 67, 77-79, and Crowder Dep.,\nPP . 27, 33•\n- 14 -\n\n/\ndecision]–  (a) to defer federal funds, and\n(b) to set up a hearing leading to the(cid:9) termina-\ntion of federal funds.\nAlso, on pages 41 and 42 there is a list of 15 actions\nwhich defendants state the United States Commissioner of\nEducation will compel local school officials to take in\norder to promote integration, although Mr. Howe in his\ntestimony emphatically denied any such intention.\nD. The Further Contentions of the Defendants Are \nWithout Merit.\nThe defendants reiterate in Part VI of their brief\ntheir contention that the guidelines conflict with certain\nlimiting provisions of Titles IV, VI, and VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964. The contentions regarding Title IV\nand VI were dealt with in the Government's main brief in\nthis case, at pp. 20-28 and also in the Court's opinion\nin United States v. Jefferson County Board of Education,\nC. A. 5, No. 23345 (decided December 29, 1966).\nRegarding Title VII, the defendants appear to argue\nthat the exclusion of state employment from coverage\nunder the fair employment provisions of the Civil Rights\nAct bars the Commissioner from re quiring faculty desegre-\ngation in his enforcement of Title VI. The argument must\n2 / The bracketed testimony from the deposition was\nomitted and \"he would take steps\" was irserted in defend-\nants summary of the testimony.\n- 15 -\n\nfail for the same reason that the contention regarding\nsection 604 of the Act must fail (see Brief of the United\nStates at 20-23) - i.e., faculty(cid:9) segregation is not\nso much an employment practice as it is a device for per-\npetuating the segregation of students in violation of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment and section 601.\nThe defendants argue further in Parts VIA, and VII\nof their brief that the guidelines are contrary to sec-\ntion 604 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act,\n20 USC §884, which declares that nothing contained in\nthat Act shall be construed to authorize federal control\nover the curriculum, program of instruction, administra-\ntion, personnel of any school. First, it is difficult\nto understand why a limitation specifically applicable\nto one statute should be read as a limitation on action\ntaken pursuant to an entirely different statute. Second,\nexcept insofar as racial factors are involved the guide-\nlines do not touch upon any of the areas barred to the\nCommissioner by §604 of the Elementary and Secondary\nEducation Act. Lastly, the entire enforcement scheme\nof Title VI necessarily generates federal scrutiny of\nall practices which conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment\nand are now routinely dealt with in Court orders. In\nthat sense the \"federal involvement\" derives from the\nConstitution and not an Act of Congress or executive\nadministration. Indeed, if §604 of the Education Act is\nread so as to immunize such factors as faculty segregation,\n- 16 -\n\ninitial racial assignment of students and racially\noriented transportation from federal scrutiny prior to\nthe granting of federal funds, that immunity itself would\nbe of doubtful constitutionality. Cf. Simkins v. Moses H.\nCone Hospital, 323 F.2d 959 (C.A. 4, 1963).3/\nAlthough they argue that the guidelines are not\n\"law\" and are akin to revenue rulings of the Internal\nRevenue Service, the defendants assert that they are\ninvalid because the President did not formally approve\nthem. We treated this question in our main brief (see\nBrief of the United States at 6-8), but we note in addi-\ntion that the defendants can point to no legislative history\nindicating that Congress expected the President, rather\nthan the Office of Education, to determine what particular\naction non-complying school systems would have to take\nunder Title VI, or that the President should review the\nCommissioner's determinations in that regard. What is\nclear is that decision of the designated rule-maker, here\nthe Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, to sub-\ndelegate the particular definition of standards to another\n3 / The restriction of §6o4 of the Elementary and Secon-\ndary Education Act is not as absolute as the defendants\nsuggest. Under §205(a) of the Act, 20 USC §241e(a),\nState agency approval of local projects must be \"consistent\nwith such basic criteria as the Commissioner may establish\"\nand the Commissioner's regulations deal with such specifics\nas the size and geographic reach of a project, eligibility\nof children for participation in a project, use of funds\nfor school construction, and procedures for evaluating the\neffectiveness of individual programs. 45 CFR §§ 116.17-\n116.22. Thus the precise impact of §604 is to reserve\nto the local agencies complete autonomy from federal regula-\ntion except insofar as that regulation is authorized by\nthe Education Act itself.\n- 17 -\n\nofficer would have to be approved by the President. Here\nit was because the subdelegation is spelled out in the\nHEW regulation itself. See 45 CFR §80.4(c).\nIt is important to emphasize that each requirement\nof the guidelines is subject to administrative challenge\nby any school system on grounds of hardship, inappli-\ncability, or invalidity as applied to it and a hearing\nofficer in a §602 proceeding may properly determine it\nshould not apply. The regulations are another matter;\nthere both the hearing officer and the Secretary must\napply them as controlling law in the absence of changes\nin the regulations. This administrative leeway in apply-\ning the guidelines, reflecting as it does their advisory\nnature, parallels the approach taken by the Fifth Circuit\nin the Jefferson County case in its adoption of the\nguidelines as judicial standards under the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Under that decision, an individual school\nboard may show why the generally applicable standards\nought not apply to it. See United States v. Jefferson\nCounty Board of Education, slip opinion at 111-112.\nThe defendants argue vigorously that the guidelines\nhave no legal force of their own and are not valid if\nthey are contrary to any statute or constitutional pro-\nvision (Defendants' Brief at 43-46). We entirely agree.\nThey are the Commissioner's view of the standards school\nboards must meet to obtain federal funds. To the extent\nthat they are contrary to any Act of Congress or the HEW\nregulations, they should be given no effect. However,\n- 1: -\n\nwe have tried to show throughout our main brief, and\nagain here, that no such conflict exists.\nIn Part VIII of their brief, the defendants chal-\nlenge anew the assurance requirement of the HEW regulations\nand they argue that the Commissioner may not lawfully\ndeny federal funds to an applicant who refuses to file\nan assurance but who nonetheless is in compliance with\nthe guidelines or a court order.\nIn our main brief we sought to demonstrate the\npropriety of the assurance requirement (Brief of the Unf.ted\nStates at 8-12). The defendants now argue that by filing\nassurances local boards somehow bargain away their govern-\nmental obligations and unlawfully bind their successors\nin office to courses of action they should be free to\navoid. But so long as boards receive federal funds, they\nare bound by the general nondiscrimination requirements\nof §601, and whether they receive federal funds or not\nthey are bound by the Fourteenth Amendment. If the\nassurances simply relate to what school boards must do\nanyway, and we believe that is the only effect of the\nassurances, they operate to enforce governmental obliga-\ntions rather than to vitiate them. Further, it is\ncommonplace for public agencies to enter into obligations\nbinding on successors. If they could not, continuity\nin government could not be sustained. Any future board\nis always free to rescind an assurance and forfeit the\n\nfuture receipt of funds, but insofar as particular\ncapital improvements or continuing programs reflect on-\ngoing federal aid, successor boards cannot and ought\nnot be able to avoid the non-discrimination commitments\n/\nof their predecessors.\nThe defendants further challenge the legality of\nfund termination where the recipient is in compliance\nwith required standards but refuses to submit an assurance.\nThe situation is implausible; if the recipient is in\nbona fide compliance, why would he refuse to file an\nassurance that this is and will continue to be the case?\nSo long as the assurance is a proper technique of\n4 / There is no basis for applying the principles quoted\nby the defendants at pp. 61-66 of their brief to in-\nvalidate the assurance requirement of the HEW regulation.\nEach of the State court cases quoted by the defendants\ninvolved a contract between a public agency and a private\nindividual in which, as payment for goods or services to\nbe provided by the private individual, the public agency\nbargained away some aspect of its governing' discretion.\nIn Gale v. Village of Kalamazoo, 23 Mich. 344, the village\ntrustees promised not to authorize the building of a\npublic market over a ten•year period in consideration of\nthe plaintiff's construction of a market; in McCortle v.\nBates, 29 Ohio St. 419, a majority of a board of education\ncontracted to approve a purchase at their next meeting\nas a board; in Leidigh v. Nebraska City, 138 Neb. 136\n(1940), city officers extended the credit of the city\nbeyond their terms of office in violation of state public\npolicy; and in Shores v. Elmore County Board of Education,\n3 S.2d 14 (Ala. Sup. Ct., 1942), the Alabama school laws\nwere construed to prohibit the making of contracts with\nbus drivers which extended beyond the term of the incumbent\nSuperintendent. Thus the cases turned on the nature of\neach public office as a matter of state law, and their\nrelevance to relations between a state agency and the\nFederal government acting pursuant to an Act of Congress\nis no where made clear by the defendants.\n- 20 -\n\nadministration, its requirement may be enforced by the\nagency that chooses to use it. If it is concluded that\nassurances ought to be filed, receipt of funds may pro-\nperly be conditioned upon the meeting of that procedural\nrequirement. There is no reason for the Commissioners\nto assume that an applicant who refuses to file an assurance\nwill, in good faith, maintain a status of compliance if\nhe refuses to assure the Commissioner that he will do\njust that, even if at the time of the refusal to assure\nhe is in fact complying.5/\nIn Parts IX and X of their brief the defendants\nargue that there is no basis for entering a declaratory\njudgment in this case. Their position is that if the\nguidelines and the assurance requirement are valid, then\nAct No. 252 has no effect. But the issue raised in the\nGovernment's complaint is whether Act No. 252 is valid,\nnot whether the guidelines are valf_d. Our pre-trial\nbrief argued that the subject matter of Act No. 252\nwas beyond the competence of the Alabama legislature,\nwhatever the partial or total invalidity of the guide-\nlines as a matter of federal law. It now appears to be\nconceded by all that the question of the validity of\n5 / \nThe defendants' further assertion that Commissioner\narrogates to himself the authority to require more than\nthe terms of court orders which are submitted in lieu of\ndesegregation plans is without substance (Defendants'\nBrief at 49). There is no evidence in this case that\nCommissioner has ever rejected a court order as insuf-\nficient, and although a plainly inadequate order can pro-\nvide no refuge from the requirements of Title VI,\nthere is no occasion for this Court to consider in the\nabstract the possibility of administrative rejection of\nany particular order.\n- 21 -\n\nAct No. 252 will turn on the validity of the guidelines,\nbut it does not follow that the guidelines question is\nthe sole pivot upon which the Court's decision must\ndepend.\nWe agree that if the guidelines are valid, Act\nNo. 252 has no residual effect. But the issues are in\nlitigation because they will not resolve themselves,\nand the vehicle for resolving them is this lawsuit to\ndetermine whether Act No. 252 conflicts and interferes\nwith basic federal law. Act No. 252 will not disappear\nas a result of this Court expressing a view that the\nguidelines are valid. The question is whether the state\nand local officials beholden to the statute understand,\nwithout being told by this Court, that if the guidelines\nare valid Act No. 252 is a nullity. We have shown in\nour main brief at pp. 29-3)4 that Act No. 252 had a sub-\nstantial impact upon school administration in Alabama.\nThe Court should not assume that the supremacy of federal\nlaw is so well understood by school officials in Alabama\nthat a decision limited to the issues raised only in\nthe defendants' counterclaim regarding the validity of\nthe guidelines would suffice to accomplish the objectives\nof the Government's main suit, should the Court fail to\ndeclare Act No. 252 invalid. Indeed, if Act No. 252\nought not be declared invalid even if the guidelines are\nsustained, the Court's jurisdiction over the Government's\nclaim falls. Since it is doubtful whether the state-\nlevel defendants may independently raise all the issues\n- 22 -\n\nregarding the guidelines contained in their counterclaim4–/\na decision which validated the guidelines but which fell\nshort of declaring Act No. 252 invalid would itself be\nsubject to jurisdictional challenge, even if the parties\nagreed to this cause.\nThe defendants in Part X of their brief characterize\nAct No. 252 as dealing only with the authority of local\nschool boards to accept federal funds. The characteriza-\ntion is inaccurate. The statute is addressed to the\nconditions that attach to the receipt of federal funds,\nand not to their receipt itself. Alabama may, for valid\ngovernmental reasons, reorganize its educational-system\nso as to withdraw from local school boards the author-\nity to receive federal funds, but it has not done so\nby the enactment of Act No. 252. Instead, it purports\nto establish what obligations the school boards undertake\nwhen they receive the funds, and, premised on a judgment re-\ngarding the legality of the guidelines, the Act restricts the\nobligations school officials may undertake in the future.\n6 / \nThe counterclaim challenging the guidelines was filed\nonly in the names of the state-level defendants. The\nTuscaloosa officials, who are sued here only by the pri-\nvate plaintiffs, have no pending claim against the United\nStates or the private plaintiffs.\n- 23 -\n\nThus the Act operates so as to interfere with the\nenforcement of Title VI in Alabahla for no reason justi-\nfiable in terms of the state's legitimate interests.\nIt should therefore be declared unconstitutional by this\n7/\nCourt. \nRespectfully submitted,\nJOHN DOAR\nAssistant Attorney General\nST.

WALLACE, Governor(cid:9) )\nof the State of Alabama, et al., )\nDefendants.\nREPLY BRIEF OF UNITED STATES \nAs we understand the principal argument of the\ndefendants, it rests on three premises:\n1. The Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964 forbid compelled racial segregation in the\npublic schools -- and nothing more.\n2. Where schools have been segregated, corrective\nL-\naction, whether judicial or administrative, should do \nmore than eliminate compulsory segregation.\n\n3. The .HEW Guidelines require the wholesale\nmixing of students to achieve racial balance.\nAs to the first and second premises, we believe\nthat the defendants' brief misconstrues the nature of\ntheir obligation under Brown and under the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964. Their obligation is not simply to desist\nfrom compelling segregation based upon race, but is\nto eliminate all aspects of racial discrimination that\ninhere in a racially-dual school system.\nAs to the third premise, the defendants misstate\nthe purpose and effect of the Guidelines. The require-\nments of the Guidelines, both on their face and as\nimplemented, relate directly to achieving compliance\nwith the mandate of the Brown decision and of Title VI\nand are not directed to achieving racial balance.\nA. The requirements of Brown and of Title VI.\nWe accept the unspoken premise underlying the\nargument of the defendants that the \"discrimination\"\nthat is forbidden by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964 is essentially the same \"discrimination\" which\nthe Supreme Court has held to be contrary to the stric-\ntures of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n2\n\nIn its first Brown decision, the Supreme Court\nheld that \"Separate educational facilities are inherently\nunequal.\" Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483,\n495 (1954).. In second Brown, the Court recognized that\nin school systems structured on the basis of racial\nsegregation a period of transition would be necessary\nto eliminate all aspects and vestiges of the dual system.\nIn determining the length of the transitional period,\nthe district courts were to be permitted to \"consider\nproblems related to administration, arising from the\nphysical condition of the school plant, the school\ntransportation system, personnel, revision of school\ndistricts and attendance areas into compact units to\nachieve a system of determining admission to public\nschools on a non-racial basis, and revision of local laws\nand regulations which may be necessary in solving the\nforegoing problems.\" Brown v. Board of Education,\n349 U.S. 294, 300-301 (1955).\nIn Brown, as in most of the early school desegre-\ngation cases, the Court was considering school systems\nthat totally compelled segregation of the races. It was,\ntherefore, natural that the language of the courts dealt\nwith \"compulsory segregation.\" Thus, the Court of\nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit, as pointed out by the\n3\n\ndefendants in their brief, frequently alluded to the\nfact that the decisions \"forbid governmentally enforced\nsegregation\" but do not \"command integration.\" See\nAvery v. Wichita Falls Independent School District,\n241 F. 2d 230, 233 (C.A. 5, 1957); Rippy v. Borders,\n250 F. 2d 690, 692 (C.A. 5, 1957); Cohen v. Public \nHousing Administration, 257 F. 2d 73, 71 (C.A. 5, 1953);\nEvers v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District,\n328 F. 2d 408 (C.A. 5, 1964).\nWhile they forbid compelled racial segregation\nin the public schools, Brown and the succeeding cases\nunquestionably do more. They forbid any discrimination\nagainst a student because of his race. With respect\nto public education, as with respect to any other govern-\nmental activity, Negroes have \"the right to stand equal\nbefore the laws of the State; that is, to be treated\nsimply as individuals without regard to race or color.\"\nBoson v. Rippy, 205 F. 2d 43, 46 (C.A. 5, 1960).\nThe Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit early\nrecognized that the mere existence of a statutory scheme\npermitting the assignment of students to schools on a\nnon-racial basis did not discharge a state's obligation\nto \"desegregate\" an already established dual system of\nschools based on race. Gibson v. Board of Public \n4\n\nInstruction of Dade County, 272 F. 2d 763 (C.A. 5, 1959).\nLater, the same Court held that even affirmative steps\nimplementing a free transfer system did not meet con-\nstitutional requirements where the underlying system\nof initial assignments based upon dual racial zones had\nnot been abolished. Augustus v. Board of Public Instruc-\ntion of Escambia County, 306 F. 2d 362 (C.A. 5, 1962).\nSee also, Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board, 303 F. 2d\n491 (C.A. 5, 1962).\nIn yet other cases, the Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit has recognized that a \"free choice\" is not\na cure-all for other elements of discrimination in a\nschool system. Thus, even before the Supreme Court\nrendered its decision in Goss v. Board of Education of \nKnoxville, 373 U.S. 683 (1963), the Court of Appeals\nheld, in a suit brought by Negro plaintiffs, that a\nschool board policy permitting white students to trans-\nfer from a school in which they were in a racial minority\nto one in which their race was a majority violated con-\nstitutional standards where the policy might \"tend to\nperpetuate racial discrimination.\" Boson v. Rippy,\nsupra, at 46.\n5\n\nJust as the Court of Appeals in Boson v. Rippy,\nsupra, anticipated the ruling of the Supreme Court in\nGoss regarding the minority transfer rule, so also did\nthe Court of Appeals in Board of Public Instruction of \nDuval County v. Braxton, 326 F. 2d 616 (C.A. 5, 1964),\nanticipate the ruling of the Supreme Court regarding\nfaculty segregation. In Bradley v. School Board of \nRichmond, 332 U.S. 103 (1965) and Rogers v. Paul,\n382. U.S. 198, (1965) the Supreme Court held that the\nracial segregation of faculty has sufficient bearing\nupon the right of the Negro student to a non-racial\neducation, that the student has legal standing to seek\ninjunctive relief against continuation of the practice.\nUnder the above decisions, the test of consti-\ntutionality is not simply whether Negroes are compelled \nto attend schools attended solely by members of their\nown race. The test is whether the state is using or\nhas used racial distinctions in the operation of the\npublic schools in such a manner that the Negro students\ndo not, in the language of Boson, \"stand equal before\nthe laws of the state.\" In short, the question here\nis not whether Negroes in Alabama are being compelled\n6\n\nby the defendants to attend all-Negro schools, but wheth-\ner the defendants have participated and are participating\nin the planning or maintenance of schools, transportation,\nor other educational services for Negroes in such a way\nas to denote their inferiority or to deprive them of an\nequal educational opportunity,\nThe language of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals\nin a somewhat similar situation is pertinent. In reject-\ning a contention that it was constitutionally permissible\nfor the Railroad Terminal station in Birmingham to main-\ntain separate waiting rooms for white and Negro passengers,\nso long as segregated use of those waiting rooms was not\nenforced, the Court saidt\nWhat is forbidden is the state action in which\ncolor (i.e., race) is the determinant. It is\nsimply beyond the constitutional competence\nof the state to command that any facility\neither shall be labeled as or reserved for\nthe exclusive or preferred use of one rather\nthan the other of the races.\nThis is not to say that integration in\nall activities must be governmentally com-\npelled, We, and others, have clearly indi-\ncated to the contrary. Cit e of Mont\nAlabama v. Gilmore, 5 Cir., 1960, 277 F. 2d\n364, at page 369 and notes 5 and 6. But the\nState may not either compel segregation in\nuse or the maintenance or making of separate\nfacilities where the criteria is race or\ncolor. Baldwin v. Morgan, 287 F. 2d 750,\n754 (C.A. 5, 1961).\n7\n\nSimilarly, the State of Alabama may not constitu-\ntionally plan, locate or maintain schools for Negroes as\nNegroes - except, as we shall hereinafter discuss, to\ncorrect the effects of the existing dual system\nB. Corrective Action\nda\nThe brief of the defendants fails to distinguish\nbetween an obligation to discontinue an unconstitutional\npractice carried on in good faith unde] the doctrine of\nPies= v. Ferguson, 163 U: S. 537 (1895, and the obliga-\ntion to take affirmative steps to disestablish an uncon-\nstitutional system that has been preserved and maintained\non a statewide basis Lo:: twelve years in open and de-\nliberate violation of federal law. This distinction, we\nbelieve, is vital in this case.\nEve: where there has been good faith, the dis-\nestablishment of an existing dual system may require more\nthan the passive discontinuance of discriminatory action.\nIn one sense, the officials of a segregated school\nsystem cease their discriminatory practices when they\ncommence assigning all new students and newly-employed\nteachers to particular schools without regard to race.\n-(cid:9) 4.7 ■•••\n\nSuch officils can say that they are doing as much, and\nshould be required to do no more, than are similar\nofficials in school districts that have never had a\nracially segregated system, Clearly, however, this would\nnot be sufficient either in logic, in fairness, or under\nthe decisions of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Cir-\ncuit and of the Supreme Court. Assignments of ta-chers\nand students already made would conttnue unless affirma-\ntive steps were taken to undo them. :-Tepending on the\nfacts of the particular case, the same might be true\nas to bus routes, athletic schedules, and the location\nof school sites and facilities. The official decision,\nin these areas, having been racially oriented in the past,\nhave an effect that will continue unless corrected. And\ncorrective action may well require that some consideration\nbe given to race.\nThe necessity of considering race in correcting\nracial discrimination and its effects has been recognized\nby the Court of Appeals for this Circuit.\nIn a rflcentec:ision, the Court of Appeals looked\nto race in determining how effective the free choice plan\nof the Mobile, Alabama, school system had been in effec-\nting desegregation. L'avis v. Board of School C3mmissioners\nof Mobile, Alabama, 364 F. 2d 396 (C.A. 5, 1966).\n- 9 -\n\nIn noting the factors that led it to conclude that the\n2ree choice plan was not operating effectively to elimi-\nnate the maintenance of separate schools upon the basis\nof race, the Court said:\nPrincipal among these is the fact that\neven as to those grades which, under the\nplan actually become \"desegregated\"4,--\nthere is no true substance in the alleged\ndesegregation. Less than two-tenths of\none percent of the Negro children in the\nsystem are attending white schools.\n364 F. 2d 396, at 901\nNot only may a chool board, and perforce a\ndistrict court, look to race in determining whether the\ndual system of schools is being effectively eliminated,\nbut racial considerations may also be employed in correc-\nting the dual system. In Wanner v. Co7anty School Board \nof Arlington County, Virginia, 357 F. 2d 452, the lower\ncourt had enjoined school authorities from closing a\ntraditionally all-Negro high school and transfering the\nNegro students to traditionally white high schools upon\nthe ground that their action was based upon racial con-\nsiderations. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit,\nin reversing, said:\nIt would be stultifying to hold that a board\nmay not move to undo arrangements artificially\ncontrived to effect or maintain segregation)\non the ground that this interference with\nthe status quo would involve \"consideration\nof race.\" When school authorities, recognizing\n- 10 -\n\nthe historic fact that existing conditions\nare based on a design to segregate the\nraces, act to undo these illegal condi-\ntions - especially conditions that have\nbeen judicially condemned - their effort\nis not to be frustrated on the ground that\nrace is not a permissible consideration.\nThis is not the \"consideration of race\"\nwhich the Constitution discountenances.\n357 F. ^d, at 454\nIn the recently .{decided case of Board of Education \nof the  Oklahoma City Plinio Schools v. Dowell, (cid:9)  F. -)d\n(C.A. 10, No. :J53, decided January 73, 1967), the\nCourt of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit was urged to revers\nthe decision of listrict Judge Bohannon in Cowell v. Board \nof Education of the Oklahoma City Public Schools, 244\nF. Supp. 971 MD. Okla., l965), requiring school auth-\norities to permit students to transfer from schools in\nw ich their race was in the majority to schools in which\ntheir race was in the minority, and rewiring the consoli-\ndation of certain traditionally all-Negro schools with\ncertain traditionally all-white schools under the so-called\n\"Princeton Plan.\" The Court of Appeals, in affirming the\nDistrict Court order in these particulars, held that it\nwas appropriate to require the school authorities to give\naffect to racial factors in order to overcorce the effects\nof the past discriminatory system. In response to the\n\nargument that such action compelled integration rather\nthan merely requiring desegregation, Circuit Judge Lewis,\nconcurring specially, said:\nhave no quarrel with the statement\nthat forced integration when viewed as an\nend in itself is not a compulsion of the\nFourteenth Amendment. But any claimed\nright to disassociation in the public\nschools must fail and fall. If desegre-\ngation of the races is to he accomplished\nin the public schools, forced association\nmust result, not as the end sought but as\nthe path to elimination of discrimination.\nAnd, to me, the argument that racial dis-\ncriminat :_on cannot be eliminated through\nfactors of judicial consideration that are\nbased upon race itself is completely self-\ndenying. The rroblem arose through con-\nsideration of race; it may now he approached\nthrough similar but enlightened consideration.\nAgain noting that the case reaches us\nfor review of the affirmative action of the\ntrial court it seems proper to emphasize\nthat we do not set out consolidation of\nschools and the majority-to-minority transfer\npolicy as compulsive instruents to accom-\nplish desegregation. But we do hold that\nsuch means are not violative of the con-\nstitutional rights of any and might properly\nhave been utilized by the School Board, and,\nin its stead, were availale to the trial\ncourt. Tie contrasting policy of minority-\nto-majority transfer, denied in Goss,\nperpetuated discrimination; here, a start\nis made toward full compliance with Brown.\nThe factor of race can no more he ignored in\nabolishing the dual system in Alabama than in Ullahoma.\nThe real objection of the defendants, however, as we see\nit, is not to consiCering the race of the students and\n\nteachers during the disestablishment of the dual system;\ntheir objection is to being required to take any affirma-\ntive steps whatever to disestablish that system. Yet,\nthis Court has already, in its order of July 13, 196'1,\nenjoined the defendant state officials from:\nFailing, in the exercise of its control\nand supervision over the public schools of\nthe State, to use such control and super-\nvision in such a manner as to nromote and\nencourage the elimination of racial dis-\ncrimination in the public schools, rather\nthan to prevent and discourage the elimi-\nnation of such discrimination.\nDespite this order, the de:fendants by their own admission\nhave done nothing to disestablish the dual system in\nAlabama. They continue to plan, propose and approve school\nconstruction upon the basis of the race of the students\nintended to be served; they still establish ,;nd fix\nattendance areas for junior colleges and trade schools\nion the Lasis of race; they still subsidize and encourage\nthe operation of local school transportation systeps on a\nracial basis, and they officially discourage the desegre-\ngation of teaching staffs.\n-- 13 -\n\nC. The Guidelines Do Not Require Racial Balance \nIn their attempt to discredit the Guidelines the\ndefendants say the Guidelines require the establishment\nof racial balance. We have already pointed out in our\nprevious brief that such an interpretation does violence\nto the language of the Guidelines. The defendants now\nattempt to make their point by referring to the admin-\nistrative practice. Pages 33 through 42 of the defendants'\nbrief purport to set forth interpretations of the Guide-\nlines by the Commissioner of Education. These interpre-\ntations need not be discussed, except to point out that\nthey are the defendants' interpretations and not the\nCommissioner's.(cid:9) The depositions of both Mr. Howe\nand Mr. Crowder, for example, explicitly deny any plan\nor attempt to establish racial balance or proportions as\na requirement for receivin federal fundsli and the\nfollowing illustration from the bottom of page 34 of\ndefendants' brief is noted to show that the import of\nthe testimony is not always clearly stated:\nMr. Howe testified ... that if such transfers\nof both students and faculty, or either, were\nnot attained [that would be one element in a\n1 / See Howe Dep., pp.(cid:9) 67, 77-79, and Crowder Dep.,\nPP . 27, 33•\n- 14 -\n\n/\ndecision]–  (a) to defer federal funds, and\n(b) to set up a hearing leading to the(cid:9) termina-\ntion of federal funds.\nAlso, on pages 41 and 42 there is a list of 15 actions\nwhich defendants state the United States Commissioner of\nEducation will compel local school officials to take in\norder to promote integration, although Mr. Howe in his\ntestimony emphatically denied any such intention.\nD. The Further Contentions of the Defendants Are \nWithout Merit.\nThe defendants reiterate in Part VI of their brief\ntheir contention that the guidelines conflict with certain\nlimiting provisions of Titles IV, VI, and VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964. The contentions regarding Title IV\nand VI were dealt with in the Government's main brief in\nthis case, at pp. 20-28 and also in the Court's opinion\nin United States v. Jefferson County Board of Education,\nC. A. 5, No. 23345 (decided December 29, 1966).\nRegarding Title VII, the defendants appear to argue\nthat the exclusion of state employment from coverage\nunder the fair employment provisions of the Civil Rights\nAct bars the Commissioner from re quiring faculty desegre-\ngation in his enforcement of Title VI. The argument must\n2 / The bracketed testimony from the deposition was\nomitted and \"he would take steps\" was irserted in defend-\nants summary of the testimony.\n- 15 -\n\nfail for the same reason that the contention regarding\nsection 604 of the Act must fail (see Brief of the United\nStates at 20-23) - i.e., faculty(cid:9) segregation is not\nso much an employment practice as it is a device for per-\npetuating the segregation of students in violation of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment and section 601.\nThe defendants argue further in Parts VIA, and VII\nof their brief that the guidelines are contrary to sec-\ntion 604 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act,\n20 USC §884, which declares that nothing contained in\nthat Act shall be construed to authorize federal control\nover the curriculum, program of instruction, administra-\ntion, personnel of any school. First, it is difficult\nto understand why a limitation specifically applicable\nto one statute should be read as a limitation on action\ntaken pursuant to an entirely different statute. Second,\nexcept insofar as racial factors are involved the guide-\nlines do not touch upon any of the areas barred to the\nCommissioner by §604 of the Elementary and Secondary\nEducation Act. Lastly, the entire enforcement scheme\nof Title VI necessarily generates federal scrutiny of\nall practices which conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment\nand are now routinely dealt with in Court orders. In\nthat sense the \"federal involvement\" derives from the\nConstitution and not an Act of Congress or executive\nadministration. Indeed, if §604 of the Education Act is\nread so as to immunize such factors as faculty segregation,\n- 16 -\n\ninitial racial assignment of students and racially\noriented transportation from federal scrutiny prior to\nthe granting of federal funds, that immunity itself would\nbe of doubtful constitutionality. Cf. Simkins v. Moses H.\nCone Hospital, 323 F.2d 959 (C.A. 4, 1963).3/\nAlthough they argue that the guidelines are not\n\"law\" and are akin to revenue rulings of the Internal\nRevenue Service, the defendants assert that they are\ninvalid because the President did not formally approve\nthem. We treated this question in our main brief (see\nBrief of the United States at 6-8), but we note in addi-\ntion that the defendants can point to no legislative history\nindicating that Congress expected the President, rather\nthan the Office of Education, to determine what particular\naction non-complying school systems would have to take\nunder Title VI, or that the President should review the\nCommissioner's determinations in that regard. What is\nclear is that decision of the designated rule-maker, here\nthe Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, to sub-\ndelegate the particular definition of standards to another\n3 / The restriction of §6o4 of the Elementary and Secon-\ndary Education Act is not as absolute as the defendants\nsuggest. Under §205(a) of the Act, 20 USC §241e(a),\nState agency approval of local projects must be \"consistent\nwith such basic criteria as the Commissioner may establish\"\nand the Commissioner's regulations deal with such specifics\nas the size and geographic reach of a project, eligibility\nof children for participation in a project, use of funds\nfor school construction, and procedures for evaluating the\neffectiveness of individual programs. 45 CFR §§ 116.17-\n116.22. Thus the precise impact of §604 is to reserve\nto the local agencies complete autonomy from federal regula-\ntion except insofar as that regulation is authorized by\nthe Education Act itself.\n- 17 -\n\nofficer would have to be approved by the President. Here\nit was because the subdelegation is spelled out in the\nHEW regulation itself. See 45 CFR §80.4(c).\nIt is important to emphasize that each requirement\nof the guidelines is subject to administrative challenge\nby any school system on grounds of hardship, inappli-\ncability, or invalidity as applied to it and a hearing\nofficer in a §602 proceeding may properly determine it\nshould not apply. The regulations are another matter;\nthere both the hearing officer and the Secretary must\napply them as controlling law in the absence of changes\nin the regulations. This administrative leeway in apply-\ning the guidelines, reflecting as it does their advisory\nnature, parallels the approach taken by the Fifth Circuit\nin the Jefferson County case in its adoption of the\nguidelines as judicial standards under the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Under that decision, an individual school\nboard may show why the generally applicable standards\nought not apply to it. See United States v. Jefferson\nCounty Board of Education, slip opinion at 111-112.\nThe defendants argue vigorously that the guidelines\nhave no legal force of their own and are not valid if\nthey are contrary to any statute or constitutional pro-\nvision (Defendants' Brief at 43-46). We entirely agree.\nThey are the Commissioner's view of the standards school\nboards must meet to obtain federal funds. To the extent\nthat they are contrary to any Act of Congress or the HEW\nregulations, they should be given no effect. However,\n- 1: -\n\nwe have tried to show throughout our main brief, and\nagain here, that no such conflict exists.\nIn Part VIII of their brief, the defendants chal-\nlenge anew the assurance requirement of the HEW regulations\nand they argue that the Commissioner may not lawfully\ndeny federal funds to an applicant who refuses to file\nan assurance but who nonetheless is in compliance with\nthe guidelines or a court order.\nIn our main brief we sought to demonstrate the\npropriety of the assurance requirement (Brief of the Unf.ted\nStates at 8-12). The defendants now argue that by filing\nassurances local boards somehow bargain away their govern-\nmental obligations and unlawfully bind their successors\nin office to courses of action they should be free to\navoid. But so long as boards receive federal funds, they\nare bound by the general nondiscrimination requirements\nof §601, and whether they receive federal funds or not\nthey are bound by the Fourteenth Amendment. If the\nassurances simply relate to what school boards must do\nanyway, and we believe that is the only effect of the\nassurances, they operate to enforce governmental obliga-\ntions rather than to vitiate them. Further, it is\ncommonplace for public agencies to enter into obligations\nbinding on successors. If they could not, continuity\nin government could not be sustained. Any future board\nis always free to rescind an assurance and forfeit the\n\nfuture receipt of funds, but insofar as particular\ncapital improvements or continuing programs reflect on-\ngoing federal aid, successor boards cannot and ought\nnot be able to avoid the non-discrimination commitments\n/\nof their predecessors.\nThe defendants further challenge the legality of\nfund termination where the recipient is in compliance\nwith required standards but refuses to submit an assurance.\nThe situation is implausible; if the recipient is in\nbona fide compliance, why would he refuse to file an\nassurance that this is and will continue to be the case?\nSo long as the assurance is a proper technique of\n4 / There is no basis for applying the principles quoted\nby the defendants at pp. 61-66 of their brief to in-\nvalidate the assurance requirement of the HEW regulation.\nEach of the State court cases quoted by the defendants\ninvolved a contract between a public agency and a private\nindividual in which, as payment for goods or services to\nbe provided by the private individual, the public agency\nbargained away some aspect of its governing' discretion.\nIn Gale v. Village of Kalamazoo, 23 Mich. 344, the village\ntrustees promised not to authorize the building of a\npublic market over a ten•year period in consideration of\nthe plaintiff's construction of a market; in McCortle v.\nBates, 29 Ohio St. 419, a majority of a board of education\ncontracted to approve a purchase at their next meeting\nas a board; in Leidigh v. Nebraska City, 138 Neb. 136\n(1940), city officers extended the credit of the city\nbeyond their terms of office in violation of state public\npolicy; and in Shores v. Elmore County Board of Education,\n3 S.2d 14 (Ala. Sup. Ct., 1942), the Alabama school laws\nwere construed to prohibit the making of contracts with\nbus drivers which extended beyond the term of the incumbent\nSuperintendent. Thus the cases turned on the nature of\neach public office as a matter of state law, and their\nrelevance to relations between a state agency and the\nFederal government acting pursuant to an Act of Congress\nis no where made clear by the defendants.\n- 20 -\n\nadministration, its requirement may be enforced by the\nagency that chooses to use it. If it is concluded that\nassurances ought to be filed, receipt of funds may pro-\nperly be conditioned upon the meeting of that procedural\nrequirement. There is no reason for the Commissioners\nto assume that an applicant who refuses to file an assurance\nwill, in good faith, maintain a status of compliance if\nhe refuses to assure the Commissioner that he will do\njust that, even if at the time of the refusal to assure\nhe is in fact complying.5/\nIn Parts IX and X of their brief the defendants\nargue that there is no basis for entering a declaratory\njudgment in this case. Their position is that if the\nguidelines and the assurance requirement are valid, then\nAct No. 252 has no effect. But the issue raised in the\nGovernment's complaint is whether Act No. 252 is valid,\nnot whether the guidelines are valf_d. Our pre-trial\nbrief argued that the subject matter of Act No. 252\nwas beyond the competence of the Alabama legislature,\nwhatever the partial or total invalidity of the guide-\nlines as a matter of federal law. It now appears to be\nconceded by all that the question of the validity of\n5 / \nThe defendants' further assertion that Commissioner\narrogates to himself the authority to require more than\nthe terms of court orders which are submitted in lieu of\ndesegregation plans is without substance (Defendants'\nBrief at 49). There is no evidence in this case that\nCommissioner has ever rejected a court order as insuf-\nficient, and although a plainly inadequate order can pro-\nvide no refuge from the requirements of Title VI,\nthere is no occasion for this Court to consider in the\nabstract the possibility of administrative rejection of\nany particular order.\n- 21 -\n\nAct No. 252 will turn on the validity of the guidelines,\nbut it does not follow that the guidelines question is\nthe sole pivot upon which the Court's decision must\ndepend.\nWe agree that if the guidelines are valid, Act\nNo. 252 has no residual effect. But the issues are in\nlitigation because they will not resolve themselves,\nand the vehicle for resolving them is this lawsuit to\ndetermine whether Act No. 252 conflicts and interferes\nwith basic federal law. Act No. 252 will not disappear\nas a result of this Court expressing a view that the\nguidelines are valid. The question is whether the state\nand local officials beholden to the statute understand,\nwithout being told by this Court, that if the guidelines\nare valid Act No. 252 is a nullity. We have shown in\nour main brief at pp. 29-3)4 that Act No. 252 had a sub-\nstantial impact upon school administration in Alabama.\nThe Court should not assume that the supremacy of federal\nlaw is so well understood by school officials in Alabama\nthat a decision limited to the issues raised only in\nthe defendants' counterclaim regarding the validity of\nthe guidelines would suffice to accomplish the objectives\nof the Government's main suit, should the Court fail to\ndeclare Act No. 252 invalid. Indeed, if Act No. 252\nought not be declared invalid even if the guidelines are\nsustained, the Court's jurisdiction over the Government's\nclaim falls. Since it is doubtful whether the state-\nlevel defendants may independently raise all the issues\n- 22 -\n\nregarding the guidelines contained in their counterclaim4–/\na decision which validated the guidelines but which fell\nshort of declaring Act No. 252 invalid would itself be\nsubject to jurisdictional challenge, even if the parties\nagreed to this cause.\nThe defendants in Part X of their brief characterize\nAct No. 252 as dealing only with the authority of local\nschool boards to accept federal funds. The characteriza-\ntion is inaccurate. The statute is addressed to the\nconditions that attach to the receipt of federal funds,\nand not to their receipt itself. Alabama may, for valid\ngovernmental reasons, reorganize its educational-system\nso as to withdraw from local school boards the author-\nity to receive federal funds, but it has not done so\nby the enactment of Act No. 252. Instead, it purports\nto establish what obligations the school boards undertake\nwhen they receive the funds, and, premised on a judgment re-\ngarding the legality of the guidelines, the Act restricts the\nobligations school officials may undertake in the future.\n6 / \nThe counterclaim challenging the guidelines was filed\nonly in the names of the state-level defendants. The\nTuscaloosa officials, who are sued here only by the pri-\nvate plaintiffs, have no pending claim against the United\nStates or the private plaintiffs.\n- 23 -\n\nThus the Act operates so as to interfere with the\nenforcement of Title VI in Alabahla for no reason justi-\nfiable in terms of the state's legitimate interests.\nIt should therefore be declared unconstitutional by this\n7/\nCourt. \nRespectfully submitted,\nJOHN DOAR\nAssistant Attorney General\nST.

No. 2457-N\nGEORGE C. WALLACE, et al.,(cid:9) )\nDefendants.\nSUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF OF THE UNITED STATES\nIn the course of oral argument on February 3,\n1967, the Court asked counsel to address themselves\nin supplemental briefs to two questions: first, whether\nthe distinction between de jure •segregation and de\nfacto segregation is sound, and, second, whether the\nfailure of the President to formally approve the guide-\nlines renders them invalid. We submit this brief in\nresponse to that request.\n\nI. The Distinction between De Jure and \nDe Facto Segregation \nDefendants maintain that the guidelines are\ninvalid because they violate sections 401(b)(cid:9) and\n.1./ \n407(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In response,\ncounsel for plaintiffs argued, in part, that these\nsections were not intended, nor should they be con-\nstrued, to limit the power of the Commissioner of Educa-\ntion to require the correction of de jure segregation,\nand that since the guidelines are confined solely to\nthat task, they do not exceed whatever limitations\nare imposed on the Commissioner's power by those sec-\ntions. It was maintained that, at the most, these\nsections are a limitation of the Commissioner's power\nto take corrective action with respect to de facto \nsegregation, with which the guidelines do not attempt\nto deal and which is not in any way involved in this\njj\"'Desegregation' means the assignment of students\nto public schools and within such schools without regard\nto their race, color, religion, or national origin,\nbut 'desegregation' shall not mean the assignment of\nstudents to public schools in order to overcome racial\nimbalance.\" 42 U.S.C. 2000c(b).\n\"[N]othing herein shall empower any official or\ncourt of the United States to issue any order seeking\nto achieve a racial balance in any school by requiring\nthe transportation of pupils or students from one\nschool to another or one school district to another in\norder to achieve such racial balance, or otherwise\nenlarge the existing power of the court to insure com-\npliance with constitutional standards.\" 42 U.S.C. 2000c-6(a)\n-\n\nlitigation. It was in response to this line of argu-\nment that the Court asked whether the distinction\nbetween de facto and de jure ftsegregation was meaning-\nful.\nAt the outset it should be noted that sections\n401(b) or 407(a) do not purport to limit the authority\nof either the Executive or Judicial Branch to take\naction to correct segregation in the public schools\nthat is prohibited by the Constitution. These sections were\nmerely included to disclaim any intention to create a\nstatutory source of authority to remedy \"racial imbalance\"\nin the public schools, which was viewed as a form of\nsegregation not prohibited by the Constitution.(cid:9) As\nSenator Humphrey stated, the pertinent language in §407(a)\nwas included \"to preclude an inference that the title\nconfers new authority to deal with 'racial imbalance'\nin schools. ...\" 110 Cong. Rec. 12714 (1964). The\ntext of §407(a) clearly manifests this intention. It\nstates that nothing contained therein shall empower the\njudiciary or executive offices from entering orders to\nA\nachieve racial balance or shall \"otherwise enlarge the\nexisting power of the court to insure compliance with\nconstitutional standards\". With respect to the judiciary,\nit might even be doubtful whether Congress could properly\nlimit the general equity powers of the federal courts in\n\na manner to prevent them from ordering a school board\nto take such measures as may be necessary and proper\nto remedy segregation that is violative of the Con-\nstitution. Cf. Yakus v. United States,321 U.S. 414, 460,\n468 (dissenting opinion of Rutledge, J.); Estep v. United\nStates, 327 U.S. 114, 125 (concurring opinion of Murphy, J.),\n132 (concurring opinion of Rutledge, J.). Nor do we\nbelieve that sections 401(b) and 407(a) limit the author-\nity of the Attorney General to commence suits to eliminate\nconstitutionally forbidden segregation in public schools\nor limit the authority of the Commissioner of Education\nto bring an end to constitutionally forbidden racial\nsegregation in public schools that are federally assisted.-1/\nWhile Congress has greater power to curtail the activities\nof these federal officials than it does to curtail the\nremedial powers of the federal courts, we find no indica-\ntion in the legislative history that, in these sections,\nCongress sought to treat the Executive differently than\nit treated the Judiciary or that it intended to limit\nthe great remedial purposes of the Civil Rights Act by\nlimiting the authority of the Executive to take appro-\npriate action in eliminating racial segregation that\nis prohibited by the Constitution. With respect to\n3J As explained more fully in our principal brief in\nthis case (pp. 23a-28), the percentage of Negro trans-\nferees used in the guidelines (45 C.F.R. §181.54) is\nnot an attempt by the Commissioner to correct \"racial\nimbalance,\" but merely an index guiding him in selecting\nthose freedom-of-choice desegregation plans which his\noffice will most carefully review.\n\nthe Commissioner of Education, such segregation would\nbe, by definition, a form of racial discrimination,\nwhich is prohibited by section 601 in all federal\nassisted activities and which the Commissioner is author-\nized and directed to remedy in section 602. See also\nSimkins v. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, 323 F.2d\n959 (4 Cir. 1963).\nCongress believed that there is a distinction\nbetween de jure and de facto segregation, and embodied it\nin the statute. Although the precise phrase \"de facto \nsegregation\" was not used, the term used, \"racial im-\nbalance,\" was viewed by Congress, as it is by the\ngeneral public, as a synonym. As Congressman Cramer\nsaid in explaining the pertinent language in section\n401(b):\nThe purpose is to prevent any semblance\nof congressional acceptance or approval of\nthe concept of \"de facto\" segregation or\nto include in the definition of \"desegre-\ngation\" any balancing of school attendance\nby moving students across school district\nlines to level off percentages where one\nrace outweighs another.\n110 Cong. Rec. 2280(1964)\nThis distinction was made because of the congressional\nunderstanding of the existing state of constitutional\ndoctrine. Congress was acting on the presumption that\nthe Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit correctly\nstated the course of judicial decision in Bell v.\nSchool City of Gary, Indiana, 324 F.2d 209 (7 Cir. 1963)\n\nthat a school board was under no constitutional duty\nto correct de facto segregation or racial imbalance.\nThat Court held that if school attendance zone lines\nare drawn without regard to race, but rather on the\nbasis of such factors as density of population, travel\ndistances, safety of the children, school operating\ncosts, and convenience to parents and children, the\nzone lines are constitutionally valid even though there\nis a racial imbalance in the schools due to the resi-\ndential patterns and the use of such criteria. The\nopinion of the Seventh Circuit was explicitly mentioned\nin the course of the congressional debate, and Senator\nHumphrey said by way of explaining section 407(a)z\nThe bill does not attempt to integrate the\nschools, but it does attempt to eliminate\nsegregation in the school systems. The\nnatural factors, such as density of\npopulation, and the distance that students\nwould have to travel are considered legiti-\nmate means to determine the validity of a\nschool district, if the school districts\nare not gerrymandered, and in effect\ndeliberately segregated. The fact that\nthere is a racial imbalance per se is\nnot something which is unconstitutional.\nThat is why we have atteipted to clarify\nit with the language of section 4.\n110 Cong. Rec. 12717 (1964)\nDe jure segregation was understood to be segregation\nthat is the result of an official policy of the school\nboard to separate the races in the public schools,\nto have one set of schools for Negro students and\nNegro teachers, and another set of schools for white\n\nstudents and white teachers. Brown v. Board of Educa-\ntion left no doubt as to the unconstitutionality of\nthat type of segregation.\nWe stress that although we reco..:ni,e\nthat Congress perceived a distinction in the state\nof the case-law with respect to the unconstitutionality\nof de facto and de lure segregation, we do not propose\nthat school boards in the South be held to a different\nconstitutional standard than those in any other part\nof the Country. Every school board in the United States\nis subject, we believe, to the same constitutional obli-\ngation -- to eliminate racial discrimination in the\noperation of its school system. This is the teaching of\nBlocker v. Board of Education of Manhassett, 226 F. Supp.\n203, remedy considered on rehearing, 229 F. Supp. 709\n(E.D. N.Y. 1964). There the Court found the school\nboard had engaged in racial discrimination in establish-\ning a single disproportionately small attendance zone\nfor one school, providing a single school for a dis-\nproportionately small student body, and adhering to\na rigid policy of not permitting students to transfer\nout of that zone, where, as a result of those policies\nand practices and residential segregation, virtually all\nthe Negroes in the community were assigned to that school\nand all the students in the school were Negro.\nThis was segregation by\n\nofficial state action that was forbidden by the Con-\nstitution and it would make no difference whether,\nfor other purposes, it was called \"de facto\" or\"de\niaro \nor whether it occurred in a school system in\nNew York rather than one in Alabama. In either case,\ncorrective action must be taken.\nWhile the ultimate constitutional standard is\nthe same for the Nation, it must be recognized, however,\nthat the application of this standard to different\nfacts will produce different results. Different\npractices require different remedies. For example,\na school board that has been operating under an official\npolicy to segregate the races, and pursuant to that\npolicy has assigned teachers to the schools on a\nracially segregated basis, might be required to take\nsteps not required of a school board that has not im-\nplemented such a policy, even in the unlikely event\nthat the racial distribution of the faculties among\nthe various schools in the two systems is the same.\nSimilarly, any school board that has determined the\nsite, the capacity and the grades of a school in\nsuch a manner so as to perpetuate racial segregation,\nshould be required to take steps to eliminate the\nsegregation attributable to its discriminatory action,\neven though similar steps would not be required of\nanother school board that did not engage in such\n\ndiscriminatory conduct, but which, solely because\nof other factors, such as the use of geographical\ncriteria and the existence of residential segrega-\ntion, also maintained some schools which were attended\nsolely by Negro students. We believe that the record\nin this case shows that all the student and faculty\nsegregation in the public schools in Alabama is attri-\nbutable to the racial discriminatory action of the\nlocal school boards and the defendant state officials,\nand that the enforcement program of the Commissioner\nof-Education and the relief we propose in Lee V. Macon \nCounty Board of Education arc(cid:9) appropriate means\nfor eliminating the effects of that action.\n\nII. The Requirement of Presidential Approval \nSection 602 of Title VI confers a rule-maing\npower on the Secretary of the Department of Health,\nEducation and Welfare, and it imposes a procedural\nrequirement that all exercises of that rule-mating power\nbe approved by the President. It authorizes and,\ndirects each federal agency extending federal financial\nassistance to issue \"rules, regulations or orders of\ngeneral applicability\" to impiement the prohititJons\nagainst racaal discrimination contained in that Title,\nand it also provides that \"[n]o such rule, regulation,\nor order shall become effective unless and until\napproved by the President.\" We contend that the guide-\nlines are not an exercise of this rule-maing power,\nLilt a mere statement of the enfol:cement po:Licies of\nthe Commissioner of Education, and that thus they need\nnot be approved by the President.(cid:9) Our posit3on is\nsupported, we believe, by traditional administrative\nlaw doctrine, by an analysis of the evolution and\nnature of the guidelines, and by a review cf the legis-\nlative history relating to the Lequirement cf presidential\napproval.\n\nA. The traditional distinction between \n\"Legislative Regulations\" and \"Inter-\npretative Regulations.\" \nExercises of a rule-making power granted to an\nadministrative agency by Congress have, according to\ntraditional administrative law doctrine, been called\n\"legislative regulations.\" See generally 1 Davis,\nAdministrative Law §§5.01-5.11 (1958). Legislative\nregulations are said to have \"the status of law\",\nwhich means that they are \"binding\" on individual\nparties, and even on a court if it is determined by\nthe court that they are (a) within the grant of the\nrule-making power, (b) reasonable, and (c) issued\npursuant to proper procedure.\nTraditional administrative law doctrine also\nrecognizes another category of agency announcements,\nwhich for lack of a better term have been called\n\"interpretative regulations.\" The phrase \"interpretative\nregulation\" is misleading because what is involved is\nnot a \"regulation\", a rule of law, but rather a judgment\nor !view of the agency on a particular question and it\nis also misleading because the distinction between a\n\"legislative regulation\" and a so-called \"interpretative\nregulation\" is not one related to the content of the agency\nannouncement. The content of a so-called interpretative\nregulation could equally be contained in a\nlegislative regulation. The\n\nessential difference between a legislative regulation\nand an interpretative regulation is \"whether or not it\nis issued pursuant to a grant of law-making power.\"\n1 Davis, Administrative Law p. 302 (1958)(cid:9) An inter-\npretative regulation is, as we understan it, a judg-\nment or policy statement of the agency that is not\nformally expressed in a rule or regulation issued pur-\nsuant to the statutory rule-making power of the agency.\nWe claim no more status for the guidelines than\nthat of so-called interpretative regulations, and it\nis therefore important to note the..r characteristics\nin some detail.\nFirst, and most importantly, because so-called\ninterpretative regulations are not an eercise of\nwhatever rule-making power may be given to an agency,\nthey, unlike legislative regulations, do not have the\n\"status of law\" nor are they \"binding.\" They are subject\nto plenary review by a court, and a court can substitute\nits judgment for that of the administrative agency on\n• the issue resolved in the interpretative regulations.\nThe so-called interpretative regulations are \"authori-\ntative\" in only two respects: (a) They guide the\nenforcement action of the administrative agency.\nAlthough the agency is theoretically free to disregard\n\nor alter these statements of policy in specific cases,\nor at any time in the future, in the interest of fair-\nness ane of establishing continuity and confidence in\nits enforcement program, as a practical matter, they\nare a generally reliable guide to what the agency's\nenforcement action wiL. Le and wh • t the agency thinks\nLI/\nit(cid:9) should be.(cid:9) (b) The so-called interpretative regula-\ntions have the power to persuade the judiciary. They\nrepresent the judgment of the administrative agency,\nand the courts can look to them for guidance. Their\nauthoritativeness in this respect will vary depending\non such factors as the extent to which the subject\nmatter is within the special competence of the administra-\ntive agency, its consistency with prior administrative\npronouncements and with standards announced by the\ncourts in construing the same or s milar concepts,\ni\nthe experience of the agency, the thoroughness in the\nconsideration of the regulation by the agency, and the\nfairness and informativeness of the procedures used\nby the agency in formulating its position.. See generally\nThe practical impact of the \"interpretative regula-\nlation\" on the conduct of the effected parties does not\nalter their nature. For example, in Frozen Food' Express \nv. United States, 351 U.S. 40, 44, 45 (i_50), the Supreme\nCourt recognied thae4o-called interpretative regulation\nof the Interstate Commerce Commission, which was issued as\n\"Report\" entitled \"Determination of Exempted Agricultural\nCommodities\", would have \"an immediate and practical\nimpact on carriers\", since the carriers could act contrary\nto the policies stated in Report only \"at the risk of in-\ncurring criminai penalties.\" See Jaffe, Judicial. Control \nof Administrative Action, pp. 4C5-403 (l';65), discussng\nthe case.\n- 13 -\n\nPO \nSkidmore v, Swift & Co., 323 U S. 134,  (1\"A4)\n(involving the \"Interpretative Lulletins\" of the\nAdministrator of the .ages and Hours Division of the\nDepartment of Labor, from which Congress, in enacting\nthe Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, withheld a general\nrule-making power).\nSecond, in issuing so-called interpretative\nregulations no formal procedures, including the\nprocedures MEM prescrihedby statute for th. exercise\nof the statutory rule-making power need be followed.\nSection 4 of the Administrative Procedures Act, for\nexample, expressly states that the notice and hearing\nrequirements imposed Ly that statute for rule-making\nshall not apply to \"interpretative rules, general\nstatements of policy, [and] rules of agency ooganiza-\ntion, procedure, or practice.\"--1/ The procedural require-\nments may be ignored, and the agency may be relieved of\nthe necessity of complying with them only at the cost of\nlessening the authoritativeness of its rulthg or judgment.\n_5/ \n5 U.S.C. 1003(a)(1964 Ed.) The Senate Committee in-\ndicated that it understood the technical meaning of the\nphrase \"interpretative rules.\" See Senate Committee\nPrint, Sen. Doc. No. 248, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 18\n(1943). The distinction between legislative and inter-\nprotative regulations was well recognized in the scholarly\nliterature at the time. See, e.g., Lee, Legislative and\nInterpretative Regulations, 20 Geo. L.J. 1 (140); and\nRep. Att'y. Gen. Comm. Ad. Proc. 90-100 (1341), quoted\nin Americal President Lines, Ltd. v. Federal Maritime \nCommission, 316 F.26 413, 422 (D.C. Cir., 1963).\n\nThe scope of judicial review is substantially broadened\nbecause these rulings or judgments are not issued\npursuant to the rule-making power in conformity to the\nprocedural requirements for exercising that power.\nThird, the so-called interpretative regulations\nmay be published in many forms. They may consist of\ngeneral policy statements of the agency, press releases,\nletters of opinion, speeches, pamphlets, handbooks,\nbulletins, or instructions, or they may find more formal\nexpression and actually be designated \"regulations\"\nby the administrative agency. The mere fact that the\npolicy or judgment of the agency is of gene:Lai applica-\nbility and is published in the Federal Register or in\nthe Code of Federal Regulations does not alter their\nnature, making them an exercise of a statutory rule-\nmaking power. For example, the Interpretative Bulletin\nof the Wage and Hour Division, the classic example of the.\nso-called interpretative regulation involve& in Skidmore \nv. Swift & Co., is of general applicability, stating\nthe administrator's views as to the coverage of the\nAct, and is published in the Code of Federal Regula-\ntionseL/\n_.6./ \nSee 29 C.F.R„ Parts 775 and(cid:9) For other exampes\nas to the form of so-called interpretative regulations\nsee generally 1 Davis, Administrative Law, p. 290 n,2C\n(\"The Federar Register for SeptemLer 27,(cid:9) contains\na large compilation of SEC interpretative regulations\nand related materials, called releases, letters or\nopinion of officers, letters of the Commission, statements\nof the Commission, and the like\"), p. 30.. (\"Nearly all\nthe regulations issued by the Secretary of Agriculture\nunder the Food and Drug Act of •9G.,> concerning standards\nfor food were interpretative--merely a 'guide for officials\nof this department in enforcing the Food and Drug /et\"),\nand p. 311 (discussing the fact that both interpretative\nan& legislative regulations of the Treasury Departm nt\ne\nare published in the Federal Register an& the Code of\nFederal Regulati ons).\n\nThe nature of this traditional administrative\nlaw category called \"interpretative regulations\" can\nbe further illustrated by discussing a leading case,\nGibson Wine Co., Inc. v. Snyder, 194 F.2d 32D, decided\nin 1952 by the Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumtia, a court that has played a prominent role in\nthe formulation of administrative law in our country.\nThat case involved a challenge to the ruling of the\nDeputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue, who was\ncharged with the administration of the Federal Alcohol\nAdministration Act.-3 The pertinent statute granted\nhim a rule-ma},-ing power, but required that exercises\nof that power be approved by the Secretary of the\nTreasury. A formal regulation had been issued sometime\nLL/\t\nSection 2(d) of the Federal Alcohol. Administration\nAct, 49 Stat. 977 (1935) provides:\nThe Administrator is authorized\nand, directed to prescrile such rules\nand regulations as may be necessary\nto carry out his powers and duties.\nAll rules and regulations presorii.ed\nby the administrator shall be subject\nto the approval of the Secretary of\nthe Treasury.\nThe Court of Appeals, 194 F.2d. at 330 n.2 states:\nThe Federal Alcohol Administration\nand the office of the Administrator\nwere abolished and their functions\ntransferred to the Alcohol Tax Unit\nof the Bureau of Internal Revenue\nand the Deputy Commissioner of\nInternal Revenue in charge of that\nunit.\n16 -\n\nago with the approval of the Secretary, tut that regL0a-\ntion merery stated that a wine made from one Icind of\nfruit shall be designated by the word \"wine\" qualified\nby the name of the fruit. The question frequently\narose as to whether wine made from boysenberries should\nbe labelled \"blackberry wine\" or \"boysenberry wine.\"\nThere was no provision in the formal legislative regula-\ntion covering this issue and accordingly the Deputy\nCommissioner ruled, stating that such wine should he\nlabelled \"boysenberry wine.\" That ruling was not\napproved by the Secretary. The District Court reviewed\nthe ruling of the Deputy Commissionei on a ptenary\nconcluded that the ruling was \"correct\" and denied the\nplaintiff-appellant injunctive relief. The Court of\nAppeals affirmed, saying (194 F.20, at 331-332):\nThe first point presented by\nappellant is that the Deputy\nCommissioner's ruling of November 30,\n1943, was an attempt to modify or\namend a regulation and was invalid\nbecause it was not approved Lv the \nSecretary, as required by the statute,\nand no hearing was had prior to the\npromulgation of the ruling, as\nrequired by the statute and by\nSection 4 of the Administrative Pro-\ncedure Act. The appellee officials\nsay that the Deputy Commissioner's\nruling was not an amendment or modi-\nfication of a regulation but was merely\nan interpretative ruling. They say\nthat interpretative rulings are within\nthe authority of the Deputy Commis-\nsioner and are not within statutory\nrequirements as to notice and hearing.\n- 17 -\n\nThe distinctive characteristics\nof interpretative rulings, as con-\ntrasted with so-called regulations,\nhave long been recognied. Adminis-\ntrative officials frequently announce\ntheir views as to the meaning of\nstatutes or regulations. Generally\nspeaking, it seems to be established\nthat 'regulations', 'sukstantive\nrules' or 'legislative rules' are\nthose which create law, usually\nimplementary to an existing law;\nwhe.,:eas interpretative rules are\nstatements as to what the adminis-\ntrative officer thinks the statute\nor regulations means.\n*\nWe think the ruling of the Deputy\nCommissioner here under consideration\nwas clearly an interpretative ruling,\nOn its face it purported to be merely\nthe opinion of the Deputy Commissioner\nas to the meaning of the regulation.\nIn the action in the District Court\nth.,, parties and the court treated it\nas an expression of opinion, We\nthink that treatment was correct.\nSince the Deputy Commissioner's\nruling was an interpretative one, it\nwas not subjct to the requirements\nof approval by the Secretary, of a\nhearing prior to promulgation, or of\nthe rule-making pIocedure of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act. Such\nexemptions have effect on the weight\nwhich the courts will accord to the\nadministrative view and thus affect\nthe limits of the judicial review....\n(Footnotes giving statutory references\nomitted and emphasis added.)\nSee also Garelic Mfq. Co. v. Wellon, 313 F.26 899\n(D.C. Cir.,1953).\n\nB. The Guidelines as a Public Statement \nof the Enforcement Policies of the \nCommissioner of Education.\nThe guidelines are not an exercise of the rule-\nmaking power conferred on the agency by Congress in\nsection 602. They are a public statement of the\npolicies that will generally guide the Commissioner\nof Education in discharging his res ponsibility under\nthe Act and the regulation that was issued under §602\nto determine the adequacy of desegregation plans sub-\nmitted to him. They are rules for the management of\nhis shop, and thus fall in the traditional category\nin administrative law of the so-called \"interpretabitie\nregulations,\" which, as discussed in the preceding\nsection of this brief, are not regulations or rules\nof law regulating the behavior of others.\nWe believe this Court need determine whether the\nguidelines are \"valid\" only in the limited sense of\nwhether they are a permissible basis upon which the\nCommissioner can base his enforcement action. Thus,\ntheir validity depends, not upon whether they were\nissued in conformity with the procedural requirements\nset forth in section 602 for exercising the statutory\nrule-making power, but rather on their consistency\nwith the substantive provisions of the statute and\nregulation. The essence of the defendants' position,\n19\n\nn/\nboth in enacting Act No. 252 of the Alabama Legislature\nand in their third party claim, is that the guidelines\nare invalid because they violate Title IV by requiring\nthe correction of racial imbalance and because they seek\nto correct \"employment practices\" in violation of section\n604 of Title VI. This should be the focus of this litiga-\ntion, and we meet those contentions in our principal brief\nin this case.\nMoreover, it should be recognized that this Court\nis being asked to determine the validity of the guidelines\nonly on their face. This means that even if this Court\nin this proceeding determines that the guidelines are\n\"valid\" in that they are consistent with the substantive\nprovision of the Act and the Regulation, it is still open\nto local school boards to assert, and for the courts to\ndecide, in particular cases whether the enforcement policies\nof the Commissioner, asepplied, are consistent with whatever\n3/ The operative provisions of Act No. 252 are con-\ntained in section 1, and read in part:\n\"Any agreement or assurance of compliance with the\nguidelines heretofore made or given by a local\ncounty or city Board of Education is null and void\nand shall have no binding effect. No local\ncounty or city Board of Education shall have the\nauthority to give any assurance of compliance with\nthe guidelines or to enter into any other agree-\nment with any agency of the government of the\nUnited States which would obligate such local\ncity or county Board of Education to adopt any\nplan for desegregation which requires the assign-\nment of students to public schools in order to\novercome racial imbalance or which would authorize\nany agent of the United States to take any unlawful\naction lAth respect to any employment practice of\nsuch board or to take other action not required\nby law.\"\n- 20 -\n\nlimitations may be in the statute respecting racial\nimbalance and employment practices. In addition, a court\nreviewing specific administrative action will be called\nin to decide questions not at all presented in this\nlitigation, namely, whether these enforcement policies\nare arbitrary or unreasonable as applied and whether the\nCommissioner is mistaken in his judgment as to what is\nrequired in a particular situation to eliminate racial\ndiscrimination in the operation of the public school\nsystem. In fact, in such a proceeding to review a\nspecific action of the Commissioner based on these guide-\nlines or policies, the court has the power to undertake\na plenary review of the Commissioner's policies and standards,\nand to determine whether, in its judgment, compliance with\nthose standards and policies is required to eliminate\nracial discrimination. This broad scope of judicial\nreview is appropriate and fair because the guidelines are\nnot an exercise of the statutory rule-making power con-\ntained in section 602. To be sure, as the Supreme Court\nin Skidmore v. Swift & Co. recognized, a reviewing court\nmay look to the guidelines \"for guidance\" as \"a body of\nexperiences and informed judgment,\" and \"the weight of\nsuch a judgment in a particular case will depend upon\n• •(cid:9) all those factors which give it power to per-\nsuade.\" 323 U.S., at 140.\n- 21 -\n\nThe formai title and Language of the gajdeines\nindicate that they are a pul is statement of the enf r)-ce-\nment policies of the Commissioner of Education not\nreguiatons o rW_es of 'aw(cid:9) For e;. :amp e the sect--.:)n\nthat ma es reference to percentages of Negro -transferees,\nl\nwhich section is perhaps the portion of the guidelines most\nin controversy in this litigation, males it unmistakably\nclear that only the enforcement policies of the Commis-\nsioner, not regulations or rules of law, are being set\nforth. That section reads:\n3181.54 Requirements for Effectiveness of\nFree Choice Plans\nA free choice Wan tends to place the\nburden of desegregation on Negro or other\nminority group students and their parents\nEven when scho& authorities underta/re good\nfaith efforts to assure its fair operation,\nthe very nature of a free choice plan and\nthe effect of longstanding community\nattitudes often tend to preclude or inhibit\nthe exercise of a truly free choice by or for\nminority group students.\nFor these reasons, the Commissioner\nwill scrutinize with special care the\noperation of voluntary plans of desegrega-\ntion in school systems which have adopted\nfree choice plans.\nIn determining whether a free choice\nplan is operating fairly and effectively,\nso as to materially further the orderly\nachievement of desegregation, the Commis-\nsioner will take into account such factors\nas community support for the plan, the\nefforts of the school system to eliminate\nthe identifiability of schools on the basis\nof race, color, or national origin by virtue\nof the composition of staff or other factors,\nand the progress actually made in elimi-\nnating past discrimination and segregation\n- 22 -\n\nThe single most substantial indication\nas to whether a free choice plan is actually\nworking to eliminate the dual school structure\nis the extent to which Negro or other minority\ngroup students have in fact transferred from\nsegregated schools. Thus, when substantial\ndesegregation actually occurs under a free\nchoice plan, there is strong evidence that\nthe plan is operating effectively and fairly,\nand is currently acceptable as a means of\nmeeting legal requirements. Conversely,\nwhere a free choice plan results in little\nor no actual desegregation, or where, having\nalready produced some degree of desegregation,\nit does not result in substantial progress,\nthere is reason to believe that the plan is\nnot operating effectively and may not be an\nappropriate or acceptable method of meeting\nconstitutional and statutory requirements.\nAs a general matter, for the 1.366-..7\nschool year the Commissioner will, in the\nabsence of other evidence to the contrary,\nassume that a free choice plan is a viable\nand effective means of completing initial\nstages of desegregation in school systems\nin which a substantia l_ percentage of the\nstudents have in fact been transferred from\nsegregated schools. Where a small degree\nof desegregation has been achieved and, on\nthe basis of the free choice registration\nheld in the spring of 1956, it appears that\nthere will not be a substantial increase in\ndesegregation for the 1966-67 school year,\nthe Commissioner will review the working of\nthe 'Dian and will normally require school\nofficials to take additional actions as a\nprerequisite to continued use of a free\nchoice plan, even as an interim device.\nIn districts with a sizable percentage\nof Negro or other minority group students, the\nCommissioner will, in general, be guided by\nthe following criteria in scheduling free\nchoice plans for review:\n(1) If a significant percentage of the\nstudents, such as 8 percent or 3 percent,\ntransferred from segregated schools for the\n1955-63 school year, total transfers on the\norder of at least twice that percentage would\nnormally be expected.\n\n(2) If a smaller percentage of the\nstudents, such as 4 percent or 5 percent,\ntransferred from segregated schools for\nthe 1955-63 school year, a substantial\nincrease in transfers would normally be\nexpected, such as would bring the total\nto at least triple the percentage for the\n1955-33 school year.\n(3) If a lower percentage of students\ntransferred for the 1965-55 school year, then\nthe rate of increase in total transfers for the\n1956-67 school year would normally be ex-\npected to be proportionately greater than\nunder (2) above.\n(4) If no students transferred from\nsegregated schools under a free choice plan\nfor the 1935-56 school year, then a very\nsubstantial start would norma:,ly be expected,\nto enable such a school system to catch up as\nquickly as possible with systems which started\nearlier. If a school system in these circum-\nstances is unable to make such a start for the\n1966-57 school year under a free choice plan,\nit will normally be required to adopt a different\ntype of plan.\nWhere there is substantial deviation from\nthese expectations, and the Commissioner con-\ncludes, on the basis of the choices actually\nmade and other available evidence, that the\nplan is not operating fairly, or is not effec-\ntive to meet constitutional and statutory\nrequirements, he `rail!_ require the school\nsystem to take additional steps to further\ndesegregation.\nSuch additional steps may include, for\nexample, reopening of the choice period,\nadditional meetings with parents and civic\ngroups, further arrangements with State or\nlocal officials to limit opportunities for\nintimidation, and other further community\npreparation. Where schools are still\nidentifiable on the basis of staff composi-\ntion as intended for students of a particular\nrace, color, or national origin, such steps\nmust in any such case include substantia'L\nfurther changes in staffing patterns to\neliminate such identifiability.\n- 24\n\nIf the Commissioner concludes that\nsuch steps would be ineffective, or if\nthey fail to remedy the defects in the\noperation of any free choice plan, he may\nrequire the school system to adopt a\ndifferent type of desegregation plan\nSimilarly, the way in which the guidelines evolved\nmal:es clear that they are merely a statement of the enforce-\nment policies of the Commissioner, and that they were made\npublic for the purpose of assisting the 'ocal school.\nboards.\nTitle VI, as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\nwas enacted in July, 1934. The next several months were\nspent in establishing the appropriate enforcement\nmachinery in the agencies and in drafting the regulation\nto be issued pursuant to the ,;,302 rule-making power,\nOn November 27, 1934, the Secretary of the Department\nof Health, Education and Welfare issued, with the approval\nof the President, a regulation establishing the basic\nlegal framework for the enforcement of Title VI by his\n9 /\ndepartment.(cid:9) 45 C.F.R., part 80. Section 8C.4(c)(2)\nrequired certain school districts to submit desegregation\nplans to the Commissioner of Education and it charged\nthe Commissioner with the responsibility of determining\nwhether the desegregation plans submitted were adequate\nto accomplish the purpose of Title VI and the regulation\n-- the elimination of racial **segregation, The relevant\nportion of the regulation reads:\n_9_/ Notice or hearing was not required for the promulga-\ntion of the regulation because section 4 of the Administra-\ntive Procedure Act exempts from the notice and hearing\nrequirements of that section \"any matter re l ating to .\nloans, grants, benefits or contracts, 5 U.SC. 003\n(1964 ed.)\n- 25 -\n\n(c) Elementary and Secondary schools. The\nrequirements of paragraph (a) of this section\nwith respect to any elementary or secondary\nschool or school system shall be deemed to be\nsatisfied if such school or school system\n. . . (2) submits a plan for the desegregation\nof such school or school system which the\nCommissioner of Education determines is ade-\nquate to accomplish the purposes of the Act\nand this Regulation and provides reasonaL'e\nassurance that it wL.1 carry out such plan\nThe regulation did not seek to spell out what such a\nplan must include, but instead relied upon the judgment\nof the Commissioner of Education. The regulation re-\nquired the school boards to take the first affirmative\nsteps in formulating desegregation plans and to submit\nthem for approval to the Commissioner. However, sec-\ntion 80.12(b) of the regulation directs the Commissioner,\nas the responsible department official, to issue to\ninterested persons \"forms and detailed instructions and\nprocedures\" for effectuating the regulation.\nIn December, 1964, almost contemporaneous/1i with\nthe publication of this regulation in the Federal Register,\ninstructions were sent to local school systems describing\nthe requirements of the Act and of the reguation.\nShortly thereafter, a memorandum entit -ted \"Supplementary\nInformation for School Districts Regarding Compliance\nwith Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1934: Non-\ndiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs\" was sent\nto local school systems to clarify certain ambiguities\nin the earlier. instructions. See e.g., Weaver Dep, U,S.\nEx. 11. With respect to desegregation plans, the\nmemorandum said:\n- 26 -\n\nE. Desegregation Plans \nThe responsibility for devising and\nimplementing a reasonable and adequate\nplan of desegregation rests with the\nlocal school district, although all must\ncomply with the Civil Rights Act.\nThe actions required to undertake the\ndesegregation of a school system may differ\nfrom community to community. Neveftheless,\nunder the provisions of the Civil Rights\nAct and the HEW Regulation, the Commissioner\nof Education must review any plan of desegrega-\ntion submitted to determine its adequacy to\naccomplish the purposes of the Act and the\nRegulation.\nNo one set of guidelines or instructions\ncan be devised which will fit all situations.\nTechnical assistance on the formulation of a\nplan can be obtained on request from the\nOffice of Education. Where local circumst-\nances raise special problems, such proL!ems\nshould be set forth in the plan together with\nthe particular solutions proposed to deal with\nthem.\nA need was soon recognized for the articulation\nof some of the standards that were to be used by the\nCommissioner of Education in judging the adequacy of\ndesegregation plans. In response to this need a\nmemorandum by F. W. Foster, Jr., Professor of Lay at\nthe University of Wisconsin and a consultant to the\nOffice of Education, was published on March 20, 1935\nin a magazine called the Saturday Review. (A copy of\nthe article, of which we asb this court to take judicial\nnotice, is attached.) The editorial preface to the\narticle states:\n- 27 -\n\nThe following memo is designed to\nprovide specific guidelines to school\nauthorities seeking to meet the terms of\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act_ .\nMr. Foster's memo has no officiai status\nand does not bind the Office of Education\nin any fashion_ Yet there is no doubt\nthat it affects directly the thinking of\nthe officials charged with the responsi-\nbility for the enforcement of Title VI as\nit applies to education.\nOne month later, on April 29, 1035, the Commis-\nsioner of Education in response to this same demand for\nan articulation of his enforcement policies issued and\ndistributed to all school districts that had sulmitted\nan unacceptab.e plan, or that were in the process of\npreparing a plan, a document that has become to be known\nas the 1965 guidelines. It was formally entit ed \"General\nl\nStatement of Policies Under Title VI of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1954 Respecting Desegregation of Elementary and\nSecondary Schools.\" At that time, the statement was\nnot published in the Federal.

However, with\ntime a need was recognized to make the statement more\navailah-e to the pubJic, and in August(cid:9) 5 it was\npublished in the Federal Register. 30 Fed, Reg. 39ei\n(August 11, 1935); 30 Fed. Reg. *0153 (August 14, 1905).\nThe nature and, purpose of the statement were clearly set\nforth in the Federal Registe:\nUnder 00.4(c) of the regulation\nissued by the Secretary and approved 3:y\nthe President (45 CFR C0.4(c), the\nCommissioner has authority and responsi-\nbility for_ determining whether a desegrega-\ntion plan submitted hy an elementary or\n- 28 -\n\nsecondary school or school system desiring\nto receive Federal. financial assistance is\nadequate to carry out the puoposes of\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of -114\n,(cid:9) . and the implementing regulation.\n. . . The following Part 100 describes\nthe policies under which the Commissioner\nwill make such determinations.\nIn order to conform his enforcement policies to\nhis experience during the first year of operation of the\nTitle VI program, the Commissioner in March, 1956, issued\na revised set of guidelines, entitled \"Revised Statement\nof Policies for School Desegregation Plans under Title VI\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1934.\" They were published in\nthe Federal Register on April 9, 1366 (31 Fed. Reg. 5:,23),\nwith an explanation essentially similar to that which\nappeared upon the publication of the 1965 guidelines in\nthe Federal Register.\n\nC. The Legislative History of the \nRequirement of Presidential \nApproval.\nWe do not believe that the legislative history\nconcerning the requirement of presidential approval\nis particularly instructive. We do believe, however,\nthat it is consistent with our position and the fore-\ngoing analysis. First, there is no indication that\nCongress intended to preclude the Secretary from issuing\nrules and regulations under §602 which require school\ndesegregation plans to be submitted to the Commissioner\nof Education as a condition of the extension of financial\nassistance for education, and which charge the Commissioner\nwith determining whether the plans are adequate to fulfill\nthe purposes of the Act. Second, there is no indication\nthat Congress intended to have the Commissioner, in exer-\ncising this function, to be without discretion to formu-\nlate enforcement policies and to be totally controlled\nby regulations issued by the Secretary and approved by\nthe President. The following analysis of the legisla-\ntive history supports these contentions.\n- 30 -\n\n(1) Genisis of the Requirement of Presidential\nApproval.\nThe requirement of presidential approval was not\nin the bill as introduced in the House by Congressman\n10 /\nCeller on June 20, 1963,(cid:9) nor in the version introduced\non October 2, 1963 and reported out of Committee to the\n11 /\nHouse for debate on November 20, 1963.(cid:9) The latter\n10/ \"Title VI -- Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted\nAssisted Programs\n\"Section 601. Notwithstanding any provision to the\ncontrary in any law of the United States providing or author-\nizing direct or indirect financial assistance for or in\nconnection with any program or activity by way of grant,\ncontract, loan, insurance, guaranty, or otherwise, no such\nlaw shall be interpreted as requiring that such financial\nassistance shall be furnished in circumstances under which\nindividuals participating in or benefiting from the program\nor activity are discriminated against on the ground of race,\ncolor, religion, or national origin or are denied par-\nticipation or benefits therein on the ground of race,\ncolor, religion, or national origin.

Each Federal department and agency\nwhich is empowered to extend Federal financial assistance\nto any program or activity, by way of grant, contract,\nor loan, shall take action to effectuate the provisions\nof Section 601 with respect to such program or activity.\nSuch action may be taken by or pursuant to rule, regulation,\nor order of general applicability and shall be consistent\nwith achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing\nthe financial assistance in connection with which the\naction is taken:\n31\n1F\n\nversion provided that administrative action to effectuate\nthe nondiscrimination requirement of the Title \"may be\ntaken by or pursuant to rule, regulation or order of\ngeneral applicability.\" In the course of debate on\nFebruary 7, 1964, Congressman Lindsay offered an amend-\nment to this version adding a requirement that the rule,\nregulation or order of general applicability be approved\nby the President.\nThe following is the entire discussion on the\nfloor of the House that preceded the adoption of the\namendment (110 Cong. Rec. 2499):\nMr. LINDSAY. Mr. Chairman, I offer an\namendment.\nThe Clerk read as follows:\nAmendment offered by Mr. Lindsay: On\npage 62, line 17, after the words \"is taken\"\ninsert \"no such rule, regulation or order\nshall become effective unless and until ap-\nproved by the President;',\nThe CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from New York\n[Mr. Lindsay] is recognized.\nMr. LINDSAY. Mr. Chairman, this amend-\nment is designed to require that the President\nshall approve rules and regulations that are\npromulgated pursuant to Section 602 of Title\nVI.\nI believe this amendment will be accepted\nby the chairman of the Committee on the Judi-\nciary and the ranking minority member. The\nmembers of your committee feel that the rule-\nmaking power is so important in this area\nand can be so significant because of the\nlatitude that this title by definition has to\ngive to the executive in drafting rules and\nregulations that the Chief Executive should\nbe required to put his stamp of approval on\n32\n\nsuch rules and regulations - after, of course,\nthe normal procedures have been followed in\npromulcjating such rules and regulations.\nMr. CELLER. Mr. Chairman, will the\ngentleman yield?\nMr. LINDSAY. I yield to the chairman of\nthe committee.\nMr. CELLER. As chairman of the Judiciary\nCommittee, I aprprove the amendment of the\ngentleman from New York.\nMr. LINDSAY. I thank the chairman.\nMr. McCULLOCH. Mr. Chairman, will the\ngentleman yield?\nMr. LINDSAY. I yield to the gentleman\nfrom Ohio.\nMr. McCULLOCH. The amendment is an\nacceptable amendment to us.\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. Mr. Chairman,\nexplanation\nI should like to have a brief \nof what the amendment would do.\nMr. LINDSAY. I yield to the gnetleman\nfrom Virginia.\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. I thought the\ngentleman had yielded the floor.\nMr. LINDSAY. I had not yet yielded the\nfloor. If the gentleman would like the floor\non his own time, I shall be glad to yield the\nfloor.\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. No.I should merely\nlike to have a more clear idea as to what the\namendment would do.\nIs it the gentleman's thought or intent\nthat the President shall personally approve\nevery regulation that is made under this\nregulatory power?\nMr. LINDSAY. No, it is not.\n- 33 -\n\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. What would it\ndo, then?\nMr. LINDSAY. Pursuant to Title VI, rules\nand regulations will have to be promulgated,\nas the gentleman will note on lines 14 and 15\non page 62 of the bill. The rules, regulations\nand orders there required, which will have to\nbe promulgated according to standard procedures,\nwith hearing and the rest, would have to be\napproved by the President of the United States.\nMr. SMITH.of Virginia. Then he would have\nto approve every one of these regulations\npersonally.\nMr. LINDSAY. No; I did not say that.\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. I thought the\ngentleman did.\nMr. LINDSAY. The rules and regulations will\nbe promulgated, and will have to be promulgated\nas indicated on the lines 14 and 15 as I have\nmentioned, and are to be approved by the\nPresident of the United States if they are to\nbe effective.\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. Did the gentleman\nnot just say they had to be approved by the\nPresident?\nMr. LINDSAY. That is correct.\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. Then what does\nthat mean? Would he have to approve them or\nwould he not have to approve them?\nMr. LINDSAY. I refer the gentleman again\nto the language to which I referred, on lines\n13 through 17 of page 62.\n\"Such action may be taken by or pursuant\nto rule, regulation, or order of general ap-\nplicability and shall be consistent with\nachievement of the objectives of the statute\nauthorizing the financial assistance in con-\nnection with which the action is taken.\nIt is those rules, regulations, or orders\nof general applicability the President would be\nrequired to approve. Very plainly stated.\n- 34 -\n\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. Perhaps so. I\nstill do not understand what the President\nwould have to do, but I am happy to see any\namendment agreed to by the gentleman from\nMr. \nNew York  Celled and the gentleman from\nOhio [Mr. McCulloch], so I am disposed to go\nalong with it. I only wish I could get them\nto agree on my amendment to prohibit slavery.\nPOFF. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman\nyield?\nMr. LINDSAY. I yield to the gentleman\nfrom Virginia.\nMr. PrFF. Mr. Chairman, I am inclined to\nfeel that the amendment is constructive in\nnature. I inquire, for the sake of the public:\nHow will the President document his approval\nof the orders and regulations? Will his approval\nappear as an Executive order? Will it he pub-\nlished in the Federal Register\nMr. LINDSAY. It will he published in the\nFederal Register.\nMr. POFF. I thank the gentleman.\nMr. JONES of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I\nmove to strike out the last word, for the\npurpose of clarifying the statement of the\ngentleman from New York.\nI should like to have the attention of\nthe gentleman from New York [Mr. Lindsay].\nIt seems, after you offered your amend-\nment, you started wiggling around. I will read\nwhat the amendment says. I got a copy from\nthe Clerk's desk. It says.\nor \n\"No such rule, regulation  order shall\nbecome effective unless and until approved by\nthe President.\"\nDoes it mean that the President has to\napprove every rule before it will become\neffective?\n- 35 -\n\nMr. LINDSAY. That is correct; if it is\napplicable to this title and is of general\napplicability.\nMr. JONES of Missouri. The amendment\nsays:\n\"No such rule * * * shall become effective\nunless and until approved by the President.\"\nMr. LINDSAY. That is correct.\nkr. JONES of Missouri. Is that not what\nthe amendment says?\nMr. LINDSAY. That is correct.\nMr. JONES of Missouri. You ought to be\nable to answer the question \"Yes\" or \"No.\"\nMr. LINDSAY. It must be a rule, regulation,\nor order of general applicability. If it is not\na rule, regulation, or order of general appli-\ncability, I would assume that the President\nwould not have to put his approval on it.\nMr. JONES of Missouri. T e \"such\" refers\ni\nback to that, but you were trying to wiggle out\nof it in the discussion of the amendment.\nMr. LINDSAY. Then, vote against the\namendment if you do not like it.\nMr. JONES of Missouri. No. I am like\nJudge Smith. I want to do anything I can to\nimprove this thing. Of course, I will vote\nagainst the bill.\nMr. LINDSAY. If the gentleman will yield\nfurther, I am sure he is trying to improve it,\nand we appreciate it.\nMr. JONES of Missouri. I am trying to\nmake it \"less worse.\"\nI yield back the balance of my time.\nThe CHAIRMAN. The question is on the\namendment offered by the gentleman from New\nYork [Mr. Lindsay].\nThe amendment was agreed to.\n- 36 -\n\nNo further changes in the presidential approval\nrequirement were made in the course of the House debate,\nand on February 10, 1934, the bill passed the House (cid:9) 110\nCong. Rec. 2805. The pertinent portion of what is now\nSection 602 read:\nEach Federal department and agency which\nis empowered to extend Federal financial\nassistance to any program or activity, ly way\nof grant, loan, or contract other than a\ncontract of insurance or guaranty, shall tale\naction to effectuate the provisions of\nsection 301 with respect to such program or\nactivity. Such action may be talen by or\npursuant to rule, regulation, or order of\ngeneral applicability and shall be con-\nsistent with achievement of the objectives\nof the statute authorizing the financial\nassistance in connection with which the\naction is ta*ften. No such rule, regulation\nor order shall become effective unless and\nuntil approved by the President,\nWhen the House bill came up for debate in the\nSenate, Senator Dirksen, on May 25, 1934, introduced\nan amendment in the nature of a substitute. 110 Cong.\nRec. 11925, His substitute changed the relevant portion\nof section 502 to read as follows (id., at -L12.0):\nSec. A2. Each Federal department\nand agency which is empowered to extend\nFederal financial assistanceito- any pro-\ngram or activity, by way of grant, loan,\nor contract other than a contract of\ninsurance or guaranty, is authorized and\ndirected to effectuate the provisions of\nsection 301 with respect to such program\nor activity bv issuing rules, regulations,\nor orders of general applicability which\nshall be consistent with achievement of\nthe objectives of the statute authorizing\nthe financial assistance in connection\nwith which the action is tal7en. No such\nrule, regulation, or order shail become\neffective unless and until approved by\nthe President.\n-37\n\nAs can be seen from the text, this suhstitute combined\nthe first two sentences in the House version into one\nsentence. The meaning was changed in that the agencies\nwere now directed to issue rues and regulations to\neffectuate the substantive provisions of the Act, the\nrules and regulations issued were to be the frameworl\nwithin which all the administrative action was to be\nta.ften and the phrase \"consistent with the achievement\nof the objectives of the statute authorizing the\nfinancial assistance\" now modified the rules and regua-\ntions rather than, as it had in the House version, the\n\"action\" to be taken to effectuate the substantive pro-\nvisions of the Act. There was no change in the sentence\nregarding presidential approval.\nThis version of section 302 was passed by the\nSenate on June 19, 19G4, and finally signed into law\non July 2, 1964. Prior to its passage in the Senate,\nseveral amendments were introduced during the course of\ndebate relating to the requirement of presidential approval.\nSenator Thurmond proposed an amendment that would have\nrequired that Congress, rather than the President,\napprove the rules and regulations issued by each agency.\n110 Cong. Rec. 13937. Senator McClellan proposed an\namendment which would have postponed the effective date\nof the Title until six months after submission to Congress\nby the President of a report identifying all programs\ncovered by the Title and informing Congress of the rules\n-38-\n\nand regulations he had approved. 110 Cong. Rec. )145.\nAnd Senator Ervin proposed to eliminate agency action\nas the primary enforcement technique and to substitute\nsuits by the Attorney General based on sworn complaints.\nUnder his proposal the agencies would have been authorized\nto withhold assistance only after a judicial determina-\ntion in such a suit that there was a violation of 601\nand no rule-making power was given to the agency. 110\nCong. Rec. 12548. All these amendments were defeated\nin the Senate.\n(2) Purposes Underlying the Requirement of\nPresidential Approva.\nThe requirement of presidential approval was, we\nbelieve, primarily thought of as a safeguard against\narbitrary administrative action, and we in no way ignore\n12/\nthe importance of that safeguard.(cid:9) Accordingly,\nall exercises of the rule-making power contained in .Li302\nhave satisfied that requirement, and the regulation so\nissued has established the basic administrative frame-\nwork circumscribing the action of the Commissioner' of\nEducation. However, there is less of a need for such a\n12/ This congressional purpose seems to require the\nPresident himself to personally exercise his responsi-\nbility and authority to approve regulations issued under\nsection 502 and not to delegate this authority or\nresponsibility to the Secretary of the Department of\nHealth, Education and Welfare or to the Commissioner of\nEducation, even though such delegation is explicitly\nallowed by the terms of 3 U.S.C. .3301 (1)64 ed.). This\nstatutory power of the President to delegate his responsi-\nbility was not mentioned in the congressional debates on\nTitle VI, but we assume that the ove-Lriding purpose of\nCongress in adopting the presidential approval require-\nment in section 602 would preclude such a delegation under\n3 U.S.C. '301 (1964 ed.).\n- 39 -\n\nchedft against arbitrary action with respect to poicy\nstatements such as the guidelines. They do not have\nl\nthe same force or status as regu ations issued 7,:.c-\nsuant to the ,i6C2 rule-mald.ng power, and the safe-\nguard against arbitrary action by the administrative\nagency lies in a b;:oad scope of judicial review. While\nit is true that action ta17.en on the basis of the 302\nregu!.ations is also subieet to judicia. review, the scope\nof review of such action is more 'imiter,-; than review of\nadministrative action predicated on the guide Lines \t In\nreviewing pazticular action predicated on the guidelines,\nthe court would decide for itself wheter, for e77ample, a\ndesegregation plan re',ected by the Commissioner is\n\"adequate\" for the purposes of the Act, using the guide-\nlines only as a body of informed judgment. The scope of\nreview wouj_d be as great as it would be if the Commissioner\nhad not issued guidelines, but had merely judged the\nadequacy of pans on a case-by-case, ad hoc basis.\nThis judicial safeguard against arbitrary administrative\naction compensates, we 1:elieve, for  lac of presidential\nap-!;)rova of the guidelines.\nWe also LeUeve ti-at the recTuirement of presidential\napnroval was to assure a measure of uniformity in the\nrues and regulations issued by the various agencies, and\nthat this legislative purpose is not in any way frustrated\nby not issuing the guidelines as ;3C2 regulations_ At\nthe outset of the debate in tie Senate on  the bill, a\n-40-\n\nletter from Attorney Genera]. Kennedy responding to\ncertain questions from Senator Cooper was read into\nthe record. See 110 Cong. Rec. 11941. The questj.on\nvas:\nHow is it intended that a consistent\nset of regulations prohibiting discrimina-\ntion in Federal financial assistance pro-\ngr.ams shall be estab.Lished throughout aU.\ndepartments and agencies? What procedure\nis provided by title VI to secure con-\nsistent regulations pursuant to, and the\nuniform application of, title VI in each\nand every Federal financial assistance\nprogram?\nThe Attorney General responded:\nSection d02 provides that each\nagency's rules and regulations must\nbe approved by the President. The\nvalidity of such rules and regula-\ntions will be subject to judicjal\nconsideration in any judicial revie'\nproceeding. Any cutoff of funds must\nbe reported to tie appropriate con-\ngressional committees.\nSee 110 Cong. Rec. 1399 (Senator Cooper's response).\nSimilarly, when Senator Thurmond's amendment to\nsubstitute the requirement of congressional approval\nfor that of presidential approval was defeated, Senator\nMiller read into the Record a letter from Deputy\nAttorney General Katzenhach, commenting on Senator\nMiller's suggestion that a phrase requiring uniformity\nin the rules and regulations be included in 3502. That\nletter said (11C Cong. Rec. 13D38):\nThis is in response to your re7uest\nfor comment on a suggestion that has been\nmade for amending the provision in section\n-41-\n\nX602 of H.R. 7152 which requires Presidentiai\napproval of the regulations to be issued\nby Federal agencies pursuant to that sec-\ntion. The suggestion is that language\nbe added directing the President to mal-e\ncertain that the regulations issued by the\nagencies not be inconsistent with each\nother.\nComplete uniformity in agency regula-\ntions is impossible because of the diversity\nin the programs and factual situations\ncovered by title VI, and in the statutes\nunder which those programs are adminis-\ntered. It is, of course, desirable that\nthe regulations be drafted so that there\nwill be no inconsistency in similar factual\nsituations involving similar statutory\nprovisions. Significant disparities in\ncommon procedures, or in the rules of\nagencies with similar programs, would be\nunjustified and, if they occurred, would\nundoubtedly lead to difficulties in the\nenforcement of title VI,\nThese considerations, as I under-\nstand it, were among the principal ones\nwhich motivated the House in writing and\nadopting the provisions for Presidential\napproval in section 302. It was intended\nthat once White House scrutiny and approval\nof agency rules was required, inconsis-\ntencies of the kind referred to would be\ndiscovered and eliminated.\nIn view of the foregoing, I do not\nbelieve that the suggested amendment is\nnecessary.\nWe believe that the congressional purpose 40\nto promote uniformity was satisfied in the promulgation\nof the regulation under r:302, which uas approved by the\nPresident. That regulation established an administra-\ntive framework in the Department of Health, Education\nand Welfare basically similar to those established  in\nall the other federal agencies with responsibility\n-42-\n\nunder Title VI. See e q., 7 CFR, Part(cid:9) (Department\nof Agriculture); 15 CFR, Part C (Department of Commerce);\n32 CFR, Part 300 (Department of Defense); 43 CFR, Part 17\n(Department of the Interior); 29 CFR, Part 31 (Depart-\nment of Labor); and 22 CFR, Part 14i (Department of\nState). The President, who Congress loo17ed to for\nobtaining uniformity among the federal agencies, approved\na regulation for the Department of Health, Education and\nWelfare which uniquely gave the Commissioner of Educa-\ntion the power to determine the adequacy of desegregation\nplans for elementary and' secondary schools, and which did\nnot seek to circumscribe the Commissioner's ',udgment as\nto the specific content of these plans. Implicit in\nthis administrative ar=rangement is a recognition that\nthe desegregation of elementary and secondary schools\nmay require time, flexibility, and professional expertise,\nand a judgment that entrusting the Commissioner with\nthis responsibility and power would not be disruptive\nuniformity within the executive branch that Congress\ndesired. This judgment has been proved correct by\nexperience.(cid:9) If the existence and e:-ezcise of this power\nby the Commissioner to determine the adequacy of the\ndesegregation plans is not disruptive of the uniformity\nCongress entrusted the President to obtain, certainly the\nguidelines, a statement of the enforcement policies of\nthe Commissioner, would he no more dl sroptv of that\nuniformity.\n- 43 -\n\nIn conclusion, there is one further matter that\nshould be mentioned.

LANDSBERG\nAttorney\nDepartment of Justice\n\nHOW THE NEW LAWS AFFECT SOUTHERN SCHOOLS\nTitle VI: Southern Education Faces the Facts\nTitle Vl of the 1964 Civil Rights Act provides that racial discrimination must be ended in all programs that receive\nfederal financial assistance. Responsibility for administering this provision for most of the federal educational pro-\ngrams lies with the Office of Education of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Requests for federal\nsupport for these programs for the 1965-66 school year are note being prepared in thousands of communities in\nboth the North and the South. And in the process, the full import of the Civil Rights Act is becoming clear.\nThe South today is a society in agonizing transition. Ancient traditions and attitudes are slowly changing before\nthe onslaught of contemporary events. For a decade or more since the 1954 and 1955 Supreme Court decisions out-\nlawing segregation in the schools, the South has been moving with more deliberation than speed in bringing Negro\nand white together in the classroom. Slowly, but inexorably, however, efforts to avoid change have been swept\naway by the courts. The inevitability of full compliance with the Supreme Court's decision has become progres-\nsively clearer as one alternative after another has been attempted and has failed. Now Title VI opens another\nmajor act in the drama of school segregation. As one Florida news headline stated it, the issue for the seventeen\nSouthern states that receive more than $350 million annually for elementary and secondary school programs is:\n\"INTEGRATE—OR LOSE FEDERAL $$.\"\nThe issue appears clear—and, to the uninitiated, simple. Yet enforcement of Title VI is a complex matter. Its\npurpose is to build, not to destroy, to liberate, not to erect barriers. But harsh and unsympathetic enforcement\nof the letter of the law could be destructive. It could deny federal support to those children most desperately in need\nof it—and in the process exacerbate sectional feelings far beyond anything we have seen to date. Yet the law must\nbe enforced.\nAware of the complex responsibility assigned to it, the Office of Education has moved with its own version of\n\"all deliberate speed.\" To date it has been more notable for its caution than for its accomplishment in providing\nspecific direction to school authorities faced with the necessities of radical change under Title VI.\nThere are, to be sure, good reasons for caution. An official statement of well-defined standards for desegregation\nwould almost certainly he interpreted as an acceptable minimum, and fete if any school districts would feel obliged\nto move beyond them. Nor is it reasonable to expect equal action from communities in Mississippi or Alabama and\nthose in Kentucky or Tennessee. Yet it is difficult to justify unequal enforcement of the law. Meanwhile, Southern\nschool authorities are not receiving the guidance they need in charting their course in unfamiliar waters.\nThe following memo is designed to provide specific guidelines to school authorities seeking to meet the terms of\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Art. It was prepared by G. W. Faster, Jr., professor of law at the University of Wis-\nconsin and consultant to the Office of Education, who has- long been deeply concerned with the problems of education.\nMr. Foster's memo has no official status and does not bind the Office of Education in any fashion. Yet there is no\ndoubt that it reflects directly the thinking of the officials charged with the responsibility for enforcement of Title VI\nas it applies to education.\nSR hopes that Southern school authorities will find these guidelines helpful in making the fateful decisions that\nconfront them. And Northern readers will find, in the calm words and careful analysis of the memo, a clear\nview of the issues as they have evolved to (late.\nTHE ISSUE posed for Southern schools by Title VI of inapplicable to districts in the seventeen states which in 1954\n the 1964 Civil Rights Act is not whether they will de- maintained legally separated Negro and white schools since\n\t segregate.

We submit this brief in\nresponse to that request.\n\nI. The Distinction between De Jure and \nDe Facto Segregation \nDefendants maintain that the guidelines are\ninvalid because they violate sections 401(b)(cid:9) and\n.1./ \n407(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In response,\ncounsel for plaintiffs argued, in part, that these\nsections were not intended, nor should they be con-\nstrued, to limit the power of the Commissioner of Educa-\ntion to require the correction of de jure segregation,\nand that since the guidelines are confined solely to\nthat task, they do not exceed whatever limitations\nare imposed on the Commissioner's power by those sec-\ntions. It was maintained that, at the most, these\nsections are a limitation of the Commissioner's power\nto take corrective action with respect to de facto \nsegregation, with which the guidelines do not attempt\nto deal and which is not in any way involved in this\njj\"'Desegregation' means the assignment of students\nto public schools and within such schools without regard\nto their race, color, religion, or national origin,\nbut 'desegregation' shall not mean the assignment of\nstudents to public schools in order to overcome racial\nimbalance.\" 42 U.S.C. 2000c(b).\n\"[N]othing herein shall empower any official or\ncourt of the United States to issue any order seeking\nto achieve a racial balance in any school by requiring\nthe transportation of pupils or students from one\nschool to another or one school district to another in\norder to achieve such racial balance, or otherwise\nenlarge the existing power of the court to insure com-\npliance with constitutional standards.\" 42 U.S.C. 2000c-6(a)\n-\n\nlitigation. It was in response to this line of argu-\nment that the Court asked whether the distinction\nbetween de facto and de jure ftsegregation was meaning-\nful.\nAt the outset it should be noted that sections\n401(b) or 407(a) do not purport to limit the authority\nof either the Executive or Judicial Branch to take\naction to correct segregation in the public schools\nthat is prohibited by the Constitution. These sections were\nmerely included to disclaim any intention to create a\nstatutory source of authority to remedy \"racial imbalance\"\nin the public schools, which was viewed as a form of\nsegregation not prohibited by the Constitution.(cid:9) As\nSenator Humphrey stated, the pertinent language in §407(a)\nwas included \"to preclude an inference that the title\nconfers new authority to deal with 'racial imbalance'\nin schools. ...\" 110 Cong. Rec. 12714 (1964). The\ntext of §407(a) clearly manifests this intention. It\nstates that nothing contained therein shall empower the\njudiciary or executive offices from entering orders to\nA\nachieve racial balance or shall \"otherwise enlarge the\nexisting power of the court to insure compliance with\nconstitutional standards\". With respect to the judiciary,\nit might even be doubtful whether Congress could properly\nlimit the general equity powers of the federal courts in\n\na manner to prevent them from ordering a school board\nto take such measures as may be necessary and proper\nto remedy segregation that is violative of the Con-\nstitution. Cf. Yakus v. United States,321 U.S. 414, 460,\n468 (dissenting opinion of Rutledge, J.); Estep v. United\nStates, 327 U.S. 114, 125 (concurring opinion of Murphy, J.),\n132 (concurring opinion of Rutledge, J.). Nor do we\nbelieve that sections 401(b) and 407(a) limit the author-\nity of the Attorney General to commence suits to eliminate\nconstitutionally forbidden segregation in public schools\nor limit the authority of the Commissioner of Education\nto bring an end to constitutionally forbidden racial\nsegregation in public schools that are federally assisted.-1/\nWhile Congress has greater power to curtail the activities\nof these federal officials than it does to curtail the\nremedial powers of the federal courts, we find no indica-\ntion in the legislative history that, in these sections,\nCongress sought to treat the Executive differently than\nit treated the Judiciary or that it intended to limit\nthe great remedial purposes of the Civil Rights Act by\nlimiting the authority of the Executive to take appro-\npriate action in eliminating racial segregation that\nis prohibited by the Constitution. With respect to\n3J As explained more fully in our principal brief in\nthis case (pp. 23a-28), the percentage of Negro trans-\nferees used in the guidelines (45 C.F.R. §181.54) is\nnot an attempt by the Commissioner to correct \"racial\nimbalance,\" but merely an index guiding him in selecting\nthose freedom-of-choice desegregation plans which his\noffice will most carefully review.\n\nthe Commissioner of Education, such segregation would\nbe, by definition, a form of racial discrimination,\nwhich is prohibited by section 601 in all federal\nassisted activities and which the Commissioner is author-\nized and directed to remedy in section 602. See also\nSimkins v. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, 323 F.2d\n959 (4 Cir. 1963).\nCongress believed that there is a distinction\nbetween de jure and de facto segregation, and embodied it\nin the statute. Although the precise phrase \"de facto \nsegregation\" was not used, the term used, \"racial im-\nbalance,\" was viewed by Congress, as it is by the\ngeneral public, as a synonym. As Congressman Cramer\nsaid in explaining the pertinent language in section\n401(b):\nThe purpose is to prevent any semblance\nof congressional acceptance or approval of\nthe concept of \"de facto\" segregation or\nto include in the definition of \"desegre-\ngation\" any balancing of school attendance\nby moving students across school district\nlines to level off percentages where one\nrace outweighs another.\n110 Cong. Rec. 2280(1964)\nThis distinction was made because of the congressional\nunderstanding of the existing state of constitutional\ndoctrine. Congress was acting on the presumption that\nthe Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit correctly\nstated the course of judicial decision in Bell v.\nSchool City of Gary, Indiana, 324 F.2d 209 (7 Cir. 1963)\n\nthat a school board was under no constitutional duty\nto correct de facto segregation or racial imbalance.\nThat Court held that if school attendance zone lines\nare drawn without regard to race, but rather on the\nbasis of such factors as density of population, travel\ndistances, safety of the children, school operating\ncosts, and convenience to parents and children, the\nzone lines are constitutionally valid even though there\nis a racial imbalance in the schools due to the resi-\ndential patterns and the use of such criteria. The\nopinion of the Seventh Circuit was explicitly mentioned\nin the course of the congressional debate, and Senator\nHumphrey said by way of explaining section 407(a)z\nThe bill does not attempt to integrate the\nschools, but it does attempt to eliminate\nsegregation in the school systems. The\nnatural factors, such as density of\npopulation, and the distance that students\nwould have to travel are considered legiti-\nmate means to determine the validity of a\nschool district, if the school districts\nare not gerrymandered, and in effect\ndeliberately segregated. The fact that\nthere is a racial imbalance per se is\nnot something which is unconstitutional.\nThat is why we have atteipted to clarify\nit with the language of section 4.\n110 Cong. Rec. 12717 (1964)\nDe jure segregation was understood to be segregation\nthat is the result of an official policy of the school\nboard to separate the races in the public schools,\nto have one set of schools for Negro students and\nNegro teachers, and another set of schools for white\n\nstudents and white teachers. Brown v. Board of Educa-\ntion left no doubt as to the unconstitutionality of\nthat type of segregation.\nWe stress that although we reco..:ni,e\nthat Congress perceived a distinction in the state\nof the case-law with respect to the unconstitutionality\nof de facto and de lure segregation, we do not propose\nthat school boards in the South be held to a different\nconstitutional standard than those in any other part\nof the Country. Every school board in the United States\nis subject, we believe, to the same constitutional obli-\ngation -- to eliminate racial discrimination in the\noperation of its school system. This is the teaching of\nBlocker v. Board of Education of Manhassett, 226 F. Supp.\n203, remedy considered on rehearing, 229 F. Supp. 709\n(E.D. N.Y. 1964). There the Court found the school\nboard had engaged in racial discrimination in establish-\ning a single disproportionately small attendance zone\nfor one school, providing a single school for a dis-\nproportionately small student body, and adhering to\na rigid policy of not permitting students to transfer\nout of that zone, where, as a result of those policies\nand practices and residential segregation, virtually all\nthe Negroes in the community were assigned to that school\nand all the students in the school were Negro.\nThis was segregation by\n\nofficial state action that was forbidden by the Con-\nstitution and it would make no difference whether,\nfor other purposes, it was called \"de facto\" or\"de\niaro \nor whether it occurred in a school system in\nNew York rather than one in Alabama. In either case,\ncorrective action must be taken.\nWhile the ultimate constitutional standard is\nthe same for the Nation, it must be recognized, however,\nthat the application of this standard to different\nfacts will produce different results. Different\npractices require different remedies. For example,\na school board that has been operating under an official\npolicy to segregate the races, and pursuant to that\npolicy has assigned teachers to the schools on a\nracially segregated basis, might be required to take\nsteps not required of a school board that has not im-\nplemented such a policy, even in the unlikely event\nthat the racial distribution of the faculties among\nthe various schools in the two systems is the same.\nSimilarly, any school board that has determined the\nsite, the capacity and the grades of a school in\nsuch a manner so as to perpetuate racial segregation,\nshould be required to take steps to eliminate the\nsegregation attributable to its discriminatory action,\neven though similar steps would not be required of\nanother school board that did not engage in such\n\ndiscriminatory conduct, but which, solely because\nof other factors, such as the use of geographical\ncriteria and the existence of residential segrega-\ntion, also maintained some schools which were attended\nsolely by Negro students. We believe that the record\nin this case shows that all the student and faculty\nsegregation in the public schools in Alabama is attri-\nbutable to the racial discriminatory action of the\nlocal school boards and the defendant state officials,\nand that the enforcement program of the Commissioner\nof-Education and the relief we propose in Lee V. Macon \nCounty Board of Education arc(cid:9) appropriate means\nfor eliminating the effects of that action.\n\nII. The Requirement of Presidential Approval \nSection 602 of Title VI confers a rule-maing\npower on the Secretary of the Department of Health,\nEducation and Welfare, and it imposes a procedural\nrequirement that all exercises of that rule-mating power\nbe approved by the President. It authorizes and,\ndirects each federal agency extending federal financial\nassistance to issue \"rules, regulations or orders of\ngeneral applicability\" to impiement the prohititJons\nagainst racaal discrimination contained in that Title,\nand it also provides that \"[n]o such rule, regulation,\nor order shall become effective unless and until\napproved by the President.\" We contend that the guide-\nlines are not an exercise of this rule-maing power,\nLilt a mere statement of the enfol:cement po:Licies of\nthe Commissioner of Education, and that thus they need\nnot be approved by the President.(cid:9) Our posit3on is\nsupported, we believe, by traditional administrative\nlaw doctrine, by an analysis of the evolution and\nnature of the guidelines, and by a review cf the legis-\nlative history relating to the Lequirement cf presidential\napproval.\n\nA. The traditional distinction between \n\"Legislative Regulations\" and \"Inter-\npretative Regulations.\" \nExercises of a rule-making power granted to an\nadministrative agency by Congress have, according to\ntraditional administrative law doctrine, been called\n\"legislative regulations.\" See generally 1 Davis,\nAdministrative Law §§5.01-5.11 (1958). Legislative\nregulations are said to have \"the status of law\",\nwhich means that they are \"binding\" on individual\nparties, and even on a court if it is determined by\nthe court that they are (a) within the grant of the\nrule-making power, (b) reasonable, and (c) issued\npursuant to proper procedure.\nTraditional administrative law doctrine also\nrecognizes another category of agency announcements,\nwhich for lack of a better term have been called\n\"interpretative regulations.\" The phrase \"interpretative\nregulation\" is misleading because what is involved is\nnot a \"regulation\", a rule of law, but rather a judgment\nor !view of the agency on a particular question and it\nis also misleading because the distinction between a\n\"legislative regulation\" and a so-called \"interpretative\nregulation\" is not one related to the content of the agency\nannouncement. The content of a so-called interpretative\nregulation could equally be contained in a\nlegislative regulation. The\n\nessential difference between a legislative regulation\nand an interpretative regulation is \"whether or not it\nis issued pursuant to a grant of law-making power.\"\n1 Davis, Administrative Law p. 302 (1958)(cid:9) An inter-\npretative regulation is, as we understan it, a judg-\nment or policy statement of the agency that is not\nformally expressed in a rule or regulation issued pur-\nsuant to the statutory rule-making power of the agency.\nWe claim no more status for the guidelines than\nthat of so-called interpretative regulations, and it\nis therefore important to note the..r characteristics\nin some detail.\nFirst, and most importantly, because so-called\ninterpretative regulations are not an eercise of\nwhatever rule-making power may be given to an agency,\nthey, unlike legislative regulations, do not have the\n\"status of law\" nor are they \"binding.\" They are subject\nto plenary review by a court, and a court can substitute\nits judgment for that of the administrative agency on\n• the issue resolved in the interpretative regulations.\nThe so-called interpretative regulations are \"authori-\ntative\" in only two respects: (a) They guide the\nenforcement action of the administrative agency.\nAlthough the agency is theoretically free to disregard\n\nor alter these statements of policy in specific cases,\nor at any time in the future, in the interest of fair-\nness ane of establishing continuity and confidence in\nits enforcement program, as a practical matter, they\nare a generally reliable guide to what the agency's\nenforcement action wiL. Le and wh • t the agency thinks\nLI/\nit(cid:9) should be.(cid:9) (b) The so-called interpretative regula-\ntions have the power to persuade the judiciary. They\nrepresent the judgment of the administrative agency,\nand the courts can look to them for guidance. Their\nauthoritativeness in this respect will vary depending\non such factors as the extent to which the subject\nmatter is within the special competence of the administra-\ntive agency, its consistency with prior administrative\npronouncements and with standards announced by the\ncourts in construing the same or s milar concepts,\ni\nthe experience of the agency, the thoroughness in the\nconsideration of the regulation by the agency, and the\nfairness and informativeness of the procedures used\nby the agency in formulating its position.. See generally\nThe practical impact of the \"interpretative regula-\nlation\" on the conduct of the effected parties does not\nalter their nature. For example, in Frozen Food' Express \nv. United States, 351 U.S. 40, 44, 45 (i_50), the Supreme\nCourt recognied thae4o-called interpretative regulation\nof the Interstate Commerce Commission, which was issued as\n\"Report\" entitled \"Determination of Exempted Agricultural\nCommodities\", would have \"an immediate and practical\nimpact on carriers\", since the carriers could act contrary\nto the policies stated in Report only \"at the risk of in-\ncurring criminai penalties.\" See Jaffe, Judicial. Control \nof Administrative Action, pp. 4C5-403 (l';65), discussng\nthe case.\n- 13 -\n\nPO \nSkidmore v, Swift & Co., 323 U S. 134,  (1\"A4)\n(involving the \"Interpretative Lulletins\" of the\nAdministrator of the .ages and Hours Division of the\nDepartment of Labor, from which Congress, in enacting\nthe Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, withheld a general\nrule-making power).\nSecond, in issuing so-called interpretative\nregulations no formal procedures, including the\nprocedures MEM prescrihedby statute for th. exercise\nof the statutory rule-making power need be followed.\nSection 4 of the Administrative Procedures Act, for\nexample, expressly states that the notice and hearing\nrequirements imposed Ly that statute for rule-making\nshall not apply to \"interpretative rules, general\nstatements of policy, [and] rules of agency ooganiza-\ntion, procedure, or practice.\"--1/ The procedural require-\nments may be ignored, and the agency may be relieved of\nthe necessity of complying with them only at the cost of\nlessening the authoritativeness of its rulthg or judgment.\n_5/ \n5 U.S.C. 1003(a)(1964 Ed.) The Senate Committee in-\ndicated that it understood the technical meaning of the\nphrase \"interpretative rules.\" See Senate Committee\nPrint, Sen. Doc. No. 248, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 18\n(1943). The distinction between legislative and inter-\nprotative regulations was well recognized in the scholarly\nliterature at the time. See, e.g., Lee, Legislative and\nInterpretative Regulations, 20 Geo. L.J. 1 (140); and\nRep. Att'y. Gen. Comm. Ad. Proc. 90-100 (1341), quoted\nin Americal President Lines, Ltd. v. Federal Maritime \nCommission, 316 F.26 413, 422 (D.C. Cir., 1963).\n\nThe scope of judicial review is substantially broadened\nbecause these rulings or judgments are not issued\npursuant to the rule-making power in conformity to the\nprocedural requirements for exercising that power.\nThird, the so-called interpretative regulations\nmay be published in many forms. They may consist of\ngeneral policy statements of the agency, press releases,\nletters of opinion, speeches, pamphlets, handbooks,\nbulletins, or instructions, or they may find more formal\nexpression and actually be designated \"regulations\"\nby the administrative agency. The mere fact that the\npolicy or judgment of the agency is of gene:Lai applica-\nbility and is published in the Federal Register or in\nthe Code of Federal Regulations does not alter their\nnature, making them an exercise of a statutory rule-\nmaking power. For example, the Interpretative Bulletin\nof the Wage and Hour Division, the classic example of the.\nso-called interpretative regulation involve& in Skidmore \nv. Swift & Co., is of general applicability, stating\nthe administrator's views as to the coverage of the\nAct, and is published in the Code of Federal Regula-\ntionseL/\n_.6./ \nSee 29 C.F.R„ Parts 775 and(cid:9) For other exampes\nas to the form of so-called interpretative regulations\nsee generally 1 Davis, Administrative Law, p. 290 n,2C\n(\"The Federar Register for SeptemLer 27,(cid:9) contains\na large compilation of SEC interpretative regulations\nand related materials, called releases, letters or\nopinion of officers, letters of the Commission, statements\nof the Commission, and the like\"), p. 30.. (\"Nearly all\nthe regulations issued by the Secretary of Agriculture\nunder the Food and Drug Act of •9G.,> concerning standards\nfor food were interpretative--merely a 'guide for officials\nof this department in enforcing the Food and Drug /et\"),\nand p. 311 (discussing the fact that both interpretative\nan& legislative regulations of the Treasury Departm nt\ne\nare published in the Federal Register an& the Code of\nFederal Regulati ons).\n\nThe nature of this traditional administrative\nlaw category called \"interpretative regulations\" can\nbe further illustrated by discussing a leading case,\nGibson Wine Co., Inc. v. Snyder, 194 F.2d 32D, decided\nin 1952 by the Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumtia, a court that has played a prominent role in\nthe formulation of administrative law in our country.\nThat case involved a challenge to the ruling of the\nDeputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue, who was\ncharged with the administration of the Federal Alcohol\nAdministration Act.-3 The pertinent statute granted\nhim a rule-ma},-ing power, but required that exercises\nof that power be approved by the Secretary of the\nTreasury. A formal regulation had been issued sometime\nLL/\t\nSection 2(d) of the Federal Alcohol. Administration\nAct, 49 Stat. 977 (1935) provides:\nThe Administrator is authorized\nand, directed to prescrile such rules\nand regulations as may be necessary\nto carry out his powers and duties.\nAll rules and regulations presorii.ed\nby the administrator shall be subject\nto the approval of the Secretary of\nthe Treasury.\nThe Court of Appeals, 194 F.2d. at 330 n.2 states:\nThe Federal Alcohol Administration\nand the office of the Administrator\nwere abolished and their functions\ntransferred to the Alcohol Tax Unit\nof the Bureau of Internal Revenue\nand the Deputy Commissioner of\nInternal Revenue in charge of that\nunit.\n16 -\n\nago with the approval of the Secretary, tut that regL0a-\ntion merery stated that a wine made from one Icind of\nfruit shall be designated by the word \"wine\" qualified\nby the name of the fruit. The question frequently\narose as to whether wine made from boysenberries should\nbe labelled \"blackberry wine\" or \"boysenberry wine.\"\nThere was no provision in the formal legislative regula-\ntion covering this issue and accordingly the Deputy\nCommissioner ruled, stating that such wine should he\nlabelled \"boysenberry wine.\" That ruling was not\napproved by the Secretary. The District Court reviewed\nthe ruling of the Deputy Commissionei on a ptenary\nconcluded that the ruling was \"correct\" and denied the\nplaintiff-appellant injunctive relief. The Court of\nAppeals affirmed, saying (194 F.20, at 331-332):\nThe first point presented by\nappellant is that the Deputy\nCommissioner's ruling of November 30,\n1943, was an attempt to modify or\namend a regulation and was invalid\nbecause it was not approved Lv the \nSecretary, as required by the statute,\nand no hearing was had prior to the\npromulgation of the ruling, as\nrequired by the statute and by\nSection 4 of the Administrative Pro-\ncedure Act. The appellee officials\nsay that the Deputy Commissioner's\nruling was not an amendment or modi-\nfication of a regulation but was merely\nan interpretative ruling. They say\nthat interpretative rulings are within\nthe authority of the Deputy Commis-\nsioner and are not within statutory\nrequirements as to notice and hearing.\n- 17 -\n\nThe distinctive characteristics\nof interpretative rulings, as con-\ntrasted with so-called regulations,\nhave long been recognied. Adminis-\ntrative officials frequently announce\ntheir views as to the meaning of\nstatutes or regulations. Generally\nspeaking, it seems to be established\nthat 'regulations', 'sukstantive\nrules' or 'legislative rules' are\nthose which create law, usually\nimplementary to an existing law;\nwhe.,:eas interpretative rules are\nstatements as to what the adminis-\ntrative officer thinks the statute\nor regulations means.\n*\nWe think the ruling of the Deputy\nCommissioner here under consideration\nwas clearly an interpretative ruling,\nOn its face it purported to be merely\nthe opinion of the Deputy Commissioner\nas to the meaning of the regulation.\nIn the action in the District Court\nth.,, parties and the court treated it\nas an expression of opinion, We\nthink that treatment was correct.\nSince the Deputy Commissioner's\nruling was an interpretative one, it\nwas not subjct to the requirements\nof approval by the Secretary, of a\nhearing prior to promulgation, or of\nthe rule-making pIocedure of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act. Such\nexemptions have effect on the weight\nwhich the courts will accord to the\nadministrative view and thus affect\nthe limits of the judicial review....\n(Footnotes giving statutory references\nomitted and emphasis added.)\nSee also Garelic Mfq. Co. v. Wellon, 313 F.26 899\n(D.C. Cir.,1953).\n\nB. The Guidelines as a Public Statement \nof the Enforcement Policies of the \nCommissioner of Education.\nThe guidelines are not an exercise of the rule-\nmaking power conferred on the agency by Congress in\nsection 602. They are a public statement of the\npolicies that will generally guide the Commissioner\nof Education in discharging his res ponsibility under\nthe Act and the regulation that was issued under §602\nto determine the adequacy of desegregation plans sub-\nmitted to him. They are rules for the management of\nhis shop, and thus fall in the traditional category\nin administrative law of the so-called \"interpretabitie\nregulations,\" which, as discussed in the preceding\nsection of this brief, are not regulations or rules\nof law regulating the behavior of others.\nWe believe this Court need determine whether the\nguidelines are \"valid\" only in the limited sense of\nwhether they are a permissible basis upon which the\nCommissioner can base his enforcement action. Thus,\ntheir validity depends, not upon whether they were\nissued in conformity with the procedural requirements\nset forth in section 602 for exercising the statutory\nrule-making power, but rather on their consistency\nwith the substantive provisions of the statute and\nregulation. The essence of the defendants' position,\n19\n\nn/\nboth in enacting Act No. 252 of the Alabama Legislature\nand in their third party claim, is that the guidelines\nare invalid because they violate Title IV by requiring\nthe correction of racial imbalance and because they seek\nto correct \"employment practices\" in violation of section\n604 of Title VI. This should be the focus of this litiga-\ntion, and we meet those contentions in our principal brief\nin this case.\nMoreover, it should be recognized that this Court\nis being asked to determine the validity of the guidelines\nonly on their face. This means that even if this Court\nin this proceeding determines that the guidelines are\n\"valid\" in that they are consistent with the substantive\nprovision of the Act and the Regulation, it is still open\nto local school boards to assert, and for the courts to\ndecide, in particular cases whether the enforcement policies\nof the Commissioner, asepplied, are consistent with whatever\n3/ The operative provisions of Act No. 252 are con-\ntained in section 1, and read in part:\n\"Any agreement or assurance of compliance with the\nguidelines heretofore made or given by a local\ncounty or city Board of Education is null and void\nand shall have no binding effect. No local\ncounty or city Board of Education shall have the\nauthority to give any assurance of compliance with\nthe guidelines or to enter into any other agree-\nment with any agency of the government of the\nUnited States which would obligate such local\ncity or county Board of Education to adopt any\nplan for desegregation which requires the assign-\nment of students to public schools in order to\novercome racial imbalance or which would authorize\nany agent of the United States to take any unlawful\naction lAth respect to any employment practice of\nsuch board or to take other action not required\nby law.\"\n- 20 -\n\nlimitations may be in the statute respecting racial\nimbalance and employment practices. In addition, a court\nreviewing specific administrative action will be called\nin to decide questions not at all presented in this\nlitigation, namely, whether these enforcement policies\nare arbitrary or unreasonable as applied and whether the\nCommissioner is mistaken in his judgment as to what is\nrequired in a particular situation to eliminate racial\ndiscrimination in the operation of the public school\nsystem. In fact, in such a proceeding to review a\nspecific action of the Commissioner based on these guide-\nlines or policies, the court has the power to undertake\na plenary review of the Commissioner's policies and standards,\nand to determine whether, in its judgment, compliance with\nthose standards and policies is required to eliminate\nracial discrimination. This broad scope of judicial\nreview is appropriate and fair because the guidelines are\nnot an exercise of the statutory rule-making power con-\ntained in section 602. To be sure, as the Supreme Court\nin Skidmore v. Swift & Co. recognized, a reviewing court\nmay look to the guidelines \"for guidance\" as \"a body of\nexperiences and informed judgment,\" and \"the weight of\nsuch a judgment in a particular case will depend upon\n• •(cid:9) all those factors which give it power to per-\nsuade.\" 323 U.S., at 140.\n- 21 -\n\nThe formai title and Language of the gajdeines\nindicate that they are a pul is statement of the enf r)-ce-\nment policies of the Commissioner of Education not\nreguiatons o rW_es of 'aw(cid:9) For e;. :amp e the sect--.:)n\nthat ma es reference to percentages of Negro -transferees,\nl\nwhich section is perhaps the portion of the guidelines most\nin controversy in this litigation, males it unmistakably\nclear that only the enforcement policies of the Commis-\nsioner, not regulations or rules of law, are being set\nforth. That section reads:\n3181.54 Requirements for Effectiveness of\nFree Choice Plans\nA free choice Wan tends to place the\nburden of desegregation on Negro or other\nminority group students and their parents\nEven when scho& authorities underta/re good\nfaith efforts to assure its fair operation,\nthe very nature of a free choice plan and\nthe effect of longstanding community\nattitudes often tend to preclude or inhibit\nthe exercise of a truly free choice by or for\nminority group students.\nFor these reasons, the Commissioner\nwill scrutinize with special care the\noperation of voluntary plans of desegrega-\ntion in school systems which have adopted\nfree choice plans.\nIn determining whether a free choice\nplan is operating fairly and effectively,\nso as to materially further the orderly\nachievement of desegregation, the Commis-\nsioner will take into account such factors\nas community support for the plan, the\nefforts of the school system to eliminate\nthe identifiability of schools on the basis\nof race, color, or national origin by virtue\nof the composition of staff or other factors,\nand the progress actually made in elimi-\nnating past discrimination and segregation\n- 22 -\n\nThe single most substantial indication\nas to whether a free choice plan is actually\nworking to eliminate the dual school structure\nis the extent to which Negro or other minority\ngroup students have in fact transferred from\nsegregated schools. Thus, when substantial\ndesegregation actually occurs under a free\nchoice plan, there is strong evidence that\nthe plan is operating effectively and fairly,\nand is currently acceptable as a means of\nmeeting legal requirements. Conversely,\nwhere a free choice plan results in little\nor no actual desegregation, or where, having\nalready produced some degree of desegregation,\nit does not result in substantial progress,\nthere is reason to believe that the plan is\nnot operating effectively and may not be an\nappropriate or acceptable method of meeting\nconstitutional and statutory requirements.\nAs a general matter, for the 1.366-..7\nschool year the Commissioner will, in the\nabsence of other evidence to the contrary,\nassume that a free choice plan is a viable\nand effective means of completing initial\nstages of desegregation in school systems\nin which a substantia l_ percentage of the\nstudents have in fact been transferred from\nsegregated schools. Where a small degree\nof desegregation has been achieved and, on\nthe basis of the free choice registration\nheld in the spring of 1956, it appears that\nthere will not be a substantial increase in\ndesegregation for the 1966-67 school year,\nthe Commissioner will review the working of\nthe 'Dian and will normally require school\nofficials to take additional actions as a\nprerequisite to continued use of a free\nchoice plan, even as an interim device.\nIn districts with a sizable percentage\nof Negro or other minority group students, the\nCommissioner will, in general, be guided by\nthe following criteria in scheduling free\nchoice plans for review:\n(1) If a significant percentage of the\nstudents, such as 8 percent or 3 percent,\ntransferred from segregated schools for the\n1955-63 school year, total transfers on the\norder of at least twice that percentage would\nnormally be expected.\n\n(2) If a smaller percentage of the\nstudents, such as 4 percent or 5 percent,\ntransferred from segregated schools for\nthe 1955-63 school year, a substantial\nincrease in transfers would normally be\nexpected, such as would bring the total\nto at least triple the percentage for the\n1955-33 school year.\n(3) If a lower percentage of students\ntransferred for the 1965-55 school year, then\nthe rate of increase in total transfers for the\n1956-67 school year would normally be ex-\npected to be proportionately greater than\nunder (2) above.\n(4) If no students transferred from\nsegregated schools under a free choice plan\nfor the 1935-56 school year, then a very\nsubstantial start would norma:,ly be expected,\nto enable such a school system to catch up as\nquickly as possible with systems which started\nearlier. If a school system in these circum-\nstances is unable to make such a start for the\n1966-57 school year under a free choice plan,\nit will normally be required to adopt a different\ntype of plan.\nWhere there is substantial deviation from\nthese expectations, and the Commissioner con-\ncludes, on the basis of the choices actually\nmade and other available evidence, that the\nplan is not operating fairly, or is not effec-\ntive to meet constitutional and statutory\nrequirements, he `rail!_ require the school\nsystem to take additional steps to further\ndesegregation.\nSuch additional steps may include, for\nexample, reopening of the choice period,\nadditional meetings with parents and civic\ngroups, further arrangements with State or\nlocal officials to limit opportunities for\nintimidation, and other further community\npreparation. Where schools are still\nidentifiable on the basis of staff composi-\ntion as intended for students of a particular\nrace, color, or national origin, such steps\nmust in any such case include substantia'L\nfurther changes in staffing patterns to\neliminate such identifiability.\n- 24\n\nIf the Commissioner concludes that\nsuch steps would be ineffective, or if\nthey fail to remedy the defects in the\noperation of any free choice plan, he may\nrequire the school system to adopt a\ndifferent type of desegregation plan\nSimilarly, the way in which the guidelines evolved\nmal:es clear that they are merely a statement of the enforce-\nment policies of the Commissioner, and that they were made\npublic for the purpose of assisting the 'ocal school.\nboards.\nTitle VI, as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\nwas enacted in July, 1934. The next several months were\nspent in establishing the appropriate enforcement\nmachinery in the agencies and in drafting the regulation\nto be issued pursuant to the ,;,302 rule-making power,\nOn November 27, 1934, the Secretary of the Department\nof Health, Education and Welfare issued, with the approval\nof the President, a regulation establishing the basic\nlegal framework for the enforcement of Title VI by his\n9 /\ndepartment.(cid:9) 45 C.F.R., part 80. Section 8C.4(c)(2)\nrequired certain school districts to submit desegregation\nplans to the Commissioner of Education and it charged\nthe Commissioner with the responsibility of determining\nwhether the desegregation plans submitted were adequate\nto accomplish the purpose of Title VI and the regulation\n-- the elimination of racial **segregation, The relevant\nportion of the regulation reads:\n_9_/ Notice or hearing was not required for the promulga-\ntion of the regulation because section 4 of the Administra-\ntive Procedure Act exempts from the notice and hearing\nrequirements of that section \"any matter re l ating to .\nloans, grants, benefits or contracts, 5 U.SC. 003\n(1964 ed.)\n- 25 -\n\n(c) Elementary and Secondary schools.

(2) submits a plan for the desegregation\nof such school or school system which the\nCommissioner of Education determines is ade-\nquate to accomplish the purposes of the Act\nand this Regulation and provides reasonaL'e\nassurance that it wL.1 carry out such plan\nThe regulation did not seek to spell out what such a\nplan must include, but instead relied upon the judgment\nof the Commissioner of Education. The regulation re-\nquired the school boards to take the first affirmative\nsteps in formulating desegregation plans and to submit\nthem for approval to the Commissioner. However, sec-\ntion 80.12(b) of the regulation directs the Commissioner,\nas the responsible department official, to issue to\ninterested persons \"forms and detailed instructions and\nprocedures\" for effectuating the regulation.\nIn December, 1964, almost contemporaneous/1i with\nthe publication of this regulation in the Federal Register,\ninstructions were sent to local school systems describing\nthe requirements of the Act and of the reguation.\nShortly thereafter, a memorandum entit -ted \"Supplementary\nInformation for School Districts Regarding Compliance\nwith Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1934: Non-\ndiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs\" was sent\nto local school systems to clarify certain ambiguities\nin the earlier. instructions. See e.g., Weaver Dep, U,S.\nEx. 11. With respect to desegregation plans, the\nmemorandum said:\n- 26 -\n\nE. Desegregation Plans \nThe responsibility for devising and\nimplementing a reasonable and adequate\nplan of desegregation rests with the\nlocal school district, although all must\ncomply with the Civil Rights Act.\nThe actions required to undertake the\ndesegregation of a school system may differ\nfrom community to community. Neveftheless,\nunder the provisions of the Civil Rights\nAct and the HEW Regulation, the Commissioner\nof Education must review any plan of desegrega-\ntion submitted to determine its adequacy to\naccomplish the purposes of the Act and the\nRegulation.\nNo one set of guidelines or instructions\ncan be devised which will fit all situations.\nTechnical assistance on the formulation of a\nplan can be obtained on request from the\nOffice of Education. Where local circumst-\nances raise special problems, such proL!ems\nshould be set forth in the plan together with\nthe particular solutions proposed to deal with\nthem.\nA need was soon recognized for the articulation\nof some of the standards that were to be used by the\nCommissioner of Education in judging the adequacy of\ndesegregation plans. In response to this need a\nmemorandum by F. W. Foster, Jr., Professor of Lay at\nthe University of Wisconsin and a consultant to the\nOffice of Education, was published on March 20, 1935\nin a magazine called the Saturday Review. (A copy of\nthe article, of which we asb this court to take judicial\nnotice, is attached.) The editorial preface to the\narticle states:\n- 27 -\n\nThe following memo is designed to\nprovide specific guidelines to school\nauthorities seeking to meet the terms of\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act_ .\nMr. Foster's memo has no officiai status\nand does not bind the Office of Education\nin any fashion_ Yet there is no doubt\nthat it affects directly the thinking of\nthe officials charged with the responsi-\nbility for the enforcement of Title VI as\nit applies to education.\nOne month later, on April 29, 1035, the Commis-\nsioner of Education in response to this same demand for\nan articulation of his enforcement policies issued and\ndistributed to all school districts that had sulmitted\nan unacceptab.e plan, or that were in the process of\npreparing a plan, a document that has become to be known\nas the 1965 guidelines. It was formally entit ed \"General\nl\nStatement of Policies Under Title VI of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1954 Respecting Desegregation of Elementary and\nSecondary Schools.\" At that time, the statement was\nnot published in the Federal. Register. However, with\ntime a need was recognized to make the statement more\navailah-e to the pubJic, and in August(cid:9) 5 it was\npublished in the Federal Register. 30 Fed, Reg. 39ei\n(August 11, 1935); 30 Fed. Reg. *0153 (August 14, 1905).\nThe nature and, purpose of the statement were clearly set\nforth in the Federal Registe:\nUnder 00.4(c) of the regulation\nissued by the Secretary and approved 3:y\nthe President (45 CFR C0.4(c), the\nCommissioner has authority and responsi-\nbility for_ determining whether a desegrega-\ntion plan submitted hy an elementary or\n- 28 -\n\nsecondary school or school system desiring\nto receive Federal. financial assistance is\nadequate to carry out the puoposes of\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of -114\n,(cid:9) . and the implementing regulation.\n. . . The following Part 100 describes\nthe policies under which the Commissioner\nwill make such determinations.\nIn order to conform his enforcement policies to\nhis experience during the first year of operation of the\nTitle VI program, the Commissioner in March, 1956, issued\na revised set of guidelines, entitled \"Revised Statement\nof Policies for School Desegregation Plans under Title VI\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1934.\" They were published in\nthe Federal Register on April 9, 1366 (31 Fed. Reg. 5:,23),\nwith an explanation essentially similar to that which\nappeared upon the publication of the 1965 guidelines in\nthe Federal Register.\n\nC. The Legislative History of the \nRequirement of Presidential \nApproval.\nWe do not believe that the legislative history\nconcerning the requirement of presidential approval\nis particularly instructive. We do believe, however,\nthat it is consistent with our position and the fore-\ngoing analysis. First, there is no indication that\nCongress intended to preclude the Secretary from issuing\nrules and regulations under §602 which require school\ndesegregation plans to be submitted to the Commissioner\nof Education as a condition of the extension of financial\nassistance for education, and which charge the Commissioner\nwith determining whether the plans are adequate to fulfill\nthe purposes of the Act. Second, there is no indication\nthat Congress intended to have the Commissioner, in exer-\ncising this function, to be without discretion to formu-\nlate enforcement policies and to be totally controlled\nby regulations issued by the Secretary and approved by\nthe President. The following analysis of the legisla-\ntive history supports these contentions.\n- 30 -\n\n(1) Genisis of the Requirement of Presidential\nApproval.\nThe requirement of presidential approval was not\nin the bill as introduced in the House by Congressman\n10 /\nCeller on June 20, 1963,(cid:9) nor in the version introduced\non October 2, 1963 and reported out of Committee to the\n11 /\nHouse for debate on November 20, 1963.(cid:9) The latter\n10/ \"Title VI -- Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted\nAssisted Programs\n\"Section 601. Notwithstanding any provision to the\ncontrary in any law of the United States providing or author-\nizing direct or indirect financial assistance for or in\nconnection with any program or activity by way of grant,\ncontract, loan, insurance, guaranty, or otherwise, no such\nlaw shall be interpreted as requiring that such financial\nassistance shall be furnished in circumstances under which\nindividuals participating in or benefiting from the program\nor activity are discriminated against on the ground of race,\ncolor, religion, or national origin or are denied par-\nticipation or benefits therein on the ground of race,\ncolor, religion, or national origin. All contracts made\nin connection with any such program or activity shall con-\ntain such conditions as the President may prescribe for\nthe purpose of assuring that there shall be no discrimination\nin employment by any contractor or subcontractor on the\nground of race, color, religion, or national origin.\"\n11/ The pertinent portion of the bill reads:\n\"Section 602. Each Federal department and agency\nwhich is empowered to extend Federal financial assistance\nto any program or activity, by way of grant, contract,\nor loan, shall take action to effectuate the provisions\nof Section 601 with respect to such program or activity.\nSuch action may be taken by or pursuant to rule, regulation,\nor order of general applicability and shall be consistent\nwith achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing\nthe financial assistance in connection with which the\naction is taken:\n31\n1F\n\nversion provided that administrative action to effectuate\nthe nondiscrimination requirement of the Title \"may be\ntaken by or pursuant to rule, regulation or order of\ngeneral applicability.\" In the course of debate on\nFebruary 7, 1964, Congressman Lindsay offered an amend-\nment to this version adding a requirement that the rule,\nregulation or order of general applicability be approved\nby the President.\nThe following is the entire discussion on the\nfloor of the House that preceded the adoption of the\namendment (110 Cong. Rec. 2499):\nMr. LINDSAY. Mr. Chairman, I offer an\namendment.\nThe Clerk read as follows:\nAmendment offered by Mr. Lindsay: On\npage 62, line 17, after the words \"is taken\"\ninsert \"no such rule, regulation or order\nshall become effective unless and until ap-\nproved by the President;',\nThe CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from New York\n[Mr. Lindsay] is recognized.\nMr. LINDSAY. Mr. Chairman, this amend-\nment is designed to require that the President\nshall approve rules and regulations that are\npromulgated pursuant to Section 602 of Title\nVI.\nI believe this amendment will be accepted\nby the chairman of the Committee on the Judi-\nciary and the ranking minority member. The\nmembers of your committee feel that the rule-\nmaking power is so important in this area\nand can be so significant because of the\nlatitude that this title by definition has to\ngive to the executive in drafting rules and\nregulations that the Chief Executive should\nbe required to put his stamp of approval on\n32\n\nsuch rules and regulations - after, of course,\nthe normal procedures have been followed in\npromulcjating such rules and regulations.\nMr. CELLER. Mr. Chairman, will the\ngentleman yield?\nMr. LINDSAY. I yield to the chairman of\nthe committee.\nMr. CELLER. As chairman of the Judiciary\nCommittee, I aprprove the amendment of the\ngentleman from New York.\nMr. LINDSAY. I thank the chairman.\nMr. McCULLOCH. Mr. Chairman, will the\ngentleman yield?\nMr. LINDSAY. I yield to the gentleman\nfrom Ohio.\nMr. McCULLOCH. The amendment is an\nacceptable amendment to us.\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. Mr. Chairman,\nexplanation\nI should like to have a brief \nof what the amendment would do.\nMr. LINDSAY. I yield to the gnetleman\nfrom Virginia.\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. I thought the\ngentleman had yielded the floor.\nMr. LINDSAY. I had not yet yielded the\nfloor. If the gentleman would like the floor\non his own time, I shall be glad to yield the\nfloor.\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. No.I should merely\nlike to have a more clear idea as to what the\namendment would do.\nIs it the gentleman's thought or intent\nthat the President shall personally approve\nevery regulation that is made under this\nregulatory power?\nMr. LINDSAY. No, it is not.\n- 33 -\n\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. What would it\ndo, then?\nMr. LINDSAY. Pursuant to Title VI, rules\nand regulations will have to be promulgated,\nas the gentleman will note on lines 14 and 15\non page 62 of the bill. The rules, regulations\nand orders there required, which will have to\nbe promulgated according to standard procedures,\nwith hearing and the rest, would have to be\napproved by the President of the United States.\nMr. SMITH.of Virginia. Then he would have\nto approve every one of these regulations\npersonally.\nMr. LINDSAY. No; I did not say that.\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. I thought the\ngentleman did.\nMr. LINDSAY. The rules and regulations will\nbe promulgated, and will have to be promulgated\nas indicated on the lines 14 and 15 as I have\nmentioned, and are to be approved by the\nPresident of the United States if they are to\nbe effective.\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. Did the gentleman\nnot just say they had to be approved by the\nPresident?\nMr. LINDSAY. That is correct.\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. Then what does\nthat mean? Would he have to approve them or\nwould he not have to approve them?\nMr. LINDSAY. I refer the gentleman again\nto the language to which I referred, on lines\n13 through 17 of page 62.\n\"Such action may be taken by or pursuant\nto rule, regulation, or order of general ap-\nplicability and shall be consistent with\nachievement of the objectives of the statute\nauthorizing the financial assistance in con-\nnection with which the action is taken.\nIt is those rules, regulations, or orders\nof general applicability the President would be\nrequired to approve. Very plainly stated.\n- 34 -\n\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. Perhaps so. I\nstill do not understand what the President\nwould have to do, but I am happy to see any\namendment agreed to by the gentleman from\nMr. \nNew York  Celled and the gentleman from\nOhio [Mr. McCulloch], so I am disposed to go\nalong with it. I only wish I could get them\nto agree on my amendment to prohibit slavery.\nPOFF. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman\nyield?\nMr. LINDSAY. I yield to the gentleman\nfrom Virginia.\nMr. PrFF. Mr. Chairman, I am inclined to\nfeel that the amendment is constructive in\nnature. I inquire, for the sake of the public:\nHow will the President document his approval\nof the orders and regulations? Will his approval\nappear as an Executive order? Will it he pub-\nlished in the Federal Register\nMr. LINDSAY. It will he published in the\nFederal Register.\nMr. POFF. I thank the gentleman.\nMr. JONES of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I\nmove to strike out the last word, for the\npurpose of clarifying the statement of the\ngentleman from New York.\nI should like to have the attention of\nthe gentleman from New York [Mr. Lindsay].\nIt seems, after you offered your amend-\nment, you started wiggling around. I will read\nwhat the amendment says. I got a copy from\nthe Clerk's desk. It says.\nor \n\"No such rule, regulation  order shall\nbecome effective unless and until approved by\nthe President.\"\nDoes it mean that the President has to\napprove every rule before it will become\neffective?\n- 35 -\n\nMr. LINDSAY. That is correct; if it is\napplicable to this title and is of general\napplicability.\nMr. JONES of Missouri. The amendment\nsays:\n\"No such rule * * * shall become effective\nunless and until approved by the President.\"\nMr. LINDSAY. That is correct.\nkr. JONES of Missouri. Is that not what\nthe amendment says?\nMr. LINDSAY. That is correct.\nMr. JONES of Missouri. You ought to be\nable to answer the question \"Yes\" or \"No.\"\nMr. LINDSAY. It must be a rule, regulation,\nor order of general applicability. If it is not\na rule, regulation, or order of general appli-\ncability, I would assume that the President\nwould not have to put his approval on it.\nMr. JONES of Missouri. T e \"such\" refers\ni\nback to that, but you were trying to wiggle out\nof it in the discussion of the amendment.\nMr. LINDSAY. Then, vote against the\namendment if you do not like it.\nMr. JONES of Missouri. No. I am like\nJudge Smith. I want to do anything I can to\nimprove this thing. Of course, I will vote\nagainst the bill.\nMr. LINDSAY. If the gentleman will yield\nfurther, I am sure he is trying to improve it,\nand we appreciate it.\nMr. JONES of Missouri. I am trying to\nmake it \"less worse.\"\nI yield back the balance of my time.\nThe CHAIRMAN. The question is on the\namendment offered by the gentleman from New\nYork [Mr. Lindsay].\nThe amendment was agreed to.\n- 36 -\n\nNo further changes in the presidential approval\nrequirement were made in the course of the House debate,\nand on February 10, 1934, the bill passed the House (cid:9) 110\nCong. Rec. 2805. The pertinent portion of what is now\nSection 602 read:\nEach Federal department and agency which\nis empowered to extend Federal financial\nassistance to any program or activity, ly way\nof grant, loan, or contract other than a\ncontract of insurance or guaranty, shall tale\naction to effectuate the provisions of\nsection 301 with respect to such program or\nactivity. Such action may be talen by or\npursuant to rule, regulation, or order of\ngeneral applicability and shall be con-\nsistent with achievement of the objectives\nof the statute authorizing the financial\nassistance in connection with which the\naction is ta*ften. No such rule, regulation\nor order shall become effective unless and\nuntil approved by the President,\nWhen the House bill came up for debate in the\nSenate, Senator Dirksen, on May 25, 1934, introduced\nan amendment in the nature of a substitute. 110 Cong.\nRec. 11925, His substitute changed the relevant portion\nof section 502 to read as follows (id., at -L12.0):\nSec. A2. Each Federal department\nand agency which is empowered to extend\nFederal financial assistanceito- any pro-\ngram or activity, by way of grant, loan,\nor contract other than a contract of\ninsurance or guaranty, is authorized and\ndirected to effectuate the provisions of\nsection 301 with respect to such program\nor activity bv issuing rules, regulations,\nor orders of general applicability which\nshall be consistent with achievement of\nthe objectives of the statute authorizing\nthe financial assistance in connection\nwith which the action is tal7en. No such\nrule, regulation, or order shail become\neffective unless and until approved by\nthe President.\n-37\n\nAs can be seen from the text, this suhstitute combined\nthe first two sentences in the House version into one\nsentence. The meaning was changed in that the agencies\nwere now directed to issue rues and regulations to\neffectuate the substantive provisions of the Act, the\nrules and regulations issued were to be the frameworl\nwithin which all the administrative action was to be\nta.ften and the phrase \"consistent with the achievement\nof the objectives of the statute authorizing the\nfinancial assistance\" now modified the rules and regua-\ntions rather than, as it had in the House version, the\n\"action\" to be taken to effectuate the substantive pro-\nvisions of the Act. There was no change in the sentence\nregarding presidential approval.\nThis version of section 302 was passed by the\nSenate on June 19, 19G4, and finally signed into law\non July 2, 1964. Prior to its passage in the Senate,\nseveral amendments were introduced during the course of\ndebate relating to the requirement of presidential approval.\nSenator Thurmond proposed an amendment that would have\nrequired that Congress, rather than the President,\napprove the rules and regulations issued by each agency.\n110 Cong. Rec. 13937. Senator McClellan proposed an\namendment which would have postponed the effective date\nof the Title until six months after submission to Congress\nby the President of a report identifying all programs\ncovered by the Title and informing Congress of the rules\n-38-\n\nand regulations he had approved. 110 Cong. Rec. )145.\nAnd Senator Ervin proposed to eliminate agency action\nas the primary enforcement technique and to substitute\nsuits by the Attorney General based on sworn complaints.\nUnder his proposal the agencies would have been authorized\nto withhold assistance only after a judicial determina-\ntion in such a suit that there was a violation of 601\nand no rule-making power was given to the agency. 110\nCong. Rec. 12548. All these amendments were defeated\nin the Senate.\n(2) Purposes Underlying the Requirement of\nPresidential Approva.\nThe requirement of presidential approval was, we\nbelieve, primarily thought of as a safeguard against\narbitrary administrative action, and we in no way ignore\n12/\nthe importance of that safeguard.(cid:9) Accordingly,\nall exercises of the rule-making power contained in .Li302\nhave satisfied that requirement, and the regulation so\nissued has established the basic administrative frame-\nwork circumscribing the action of the Commissioner' of\nEducation. However, there is less of a need for such a\n12/ This congressional purpose seems to require the\nPresident himself to personally exercise his responsi-\nbility and authority to approve regulations issued under\nsection 502 and not to delegate this authority or\nresponsibility to the Secretary of the Department of\nHealth, Education and Welfare or to the Commissioner of\nEducation, even though such delegation is explicitly\nallowed by the terms of 3 U.S.C. .3301 (1)64 ed.). This\nstatutory power of the President to delegate his responsi-\nbility was not mentioned in the congressional debates on\nTitle VI, but we assume that the ove-Lriding purpose of\nCongress in adopting the presidential approval require-\nment in section 602 would preclude such a delegation under\n3 U.S.C. '301 (1964 ed.).\n- 39 -\n\nchedft against arbitrary action with respect to poicy\nstatements such as the guidelines. They do not have\nl\nthe same force or status as regu ations issued 7,:.c-\nsuant to the ,i6C2 rule-mald.ng power, and the safe-\nguard against arbitrary action by the administrative\nagency lies in a b;:oad scope of judicial review. While\nit is true that action ta17.en on the basis of the 302\nregu!.ations is also subieet to judicia. review, the scope\nof review of such action is more 'imiter,-; than review of\nadministrative action predicated on the guide Lines \t In\nreviewing pazticular action predicated on the guidelines,\nthe court would decide for itself wheter, for e77ample, a\ndesegregation plan re',ected by the Commissioner is\n\"adequate\" for the purposes of the Act, using the guide-\nlines only as a body of informed judgment. The scope of\nreview wouj_d be as great as it would be if the Commissioner\nhad not issued guidelines, but had merely judged the\nadequacy of pans on a case-by-case, ad hoc basis.\nThis judicial safeguard against arbitrary administrative\naction compensates, we 1:elieve, for  lac of presidential\nap-!;)rova of the guidelines.\nWe also LeUeve ti-at the recTuirement of presidential\napnroval was to assure a measure of uniformity in the\nrues and regulations issued by the various agencies, and\nthat this legislative purpose is not in any way frustrated\nby not issuing the guidelines as ;3C2 regulations_ At\nthe outset of the debate in tie Senate on  the bill, a\n-40-\n\nletter from Attorney Genera]. Kennedy responding to\ncertain questions from Senator Cooper was read into\nthe record. See 110 Cong. Rec. 11941. The questj.on\nvas:\nHow is it intended that a consistent\nset of regulations prohibiting discrimina-\ntion in Federal financial assistance pro-\ngr.ams shall be estab.Lished throughout aU.\ndepartments and agencies? What procedure\nis provided by title VI to secure con-\nsistent regulations pursuant to, and the\nuniform application of, title VI in each\nand every Federal financial assistance\nprogram?\nThe Attorney General responded:\nSection d02 provides that each\nagency's rules and regulations must\nbe approved by the President. The\nvalidity of such rules and regula-\ntions will be subject to judicjal\nconsideration in any judicial revie'\nproceeding. Any cutoff of funds must\nbe reported to tie appropriate con-\ngressional committees.\nSee 110 Cong. Rec. 1399 (Senator Cooper's response).\nSimilarly, when Senator Thurmond's amendment to\nsubstitute the requirement of congressional approval\nfor that of presidential approval was defeated, Senator\nMiller read into the Record a letter from Deputy\nAttorney General Katzenhach, commenting on Senator\nMiller's suggestion that a phrase requiring uniformity\nin the rules and regulations be included in 3502. That\nletter said (11C Cong. Rec. 13D38):\nThis is in response to your re7uest\nfor comment on a suggestion that has been\nmade for amending the provision in section\n-41-\n\nX602 of H.R. 7152 which requires Presidentiai\napproval of the regulations to be issued\nby Federal agencies pursuant to that sec-\ntion. The suggestion is that language\nbe added directing the President to mal-e\ncertain that the regulations issued by the\nagencies not be inconsistent with each\nother.\nComplete uniformity in agency regula-\ntions is impossible because of the diversity\nin the programs and factual situations\ncovered by title VI, and in the statutes\nunder which those programs are adminis-\ntered. It is, of course, desirable that\nthe regulations be drafted so that there\nwill be no inconsistency in similar factual\nsituations involving similar statutory\nprovisions. Significant disparities in\ncommon procedures, or in the rules of\nagencies with similar programs, would be\nunjustified and, if they occurred, would\nundoubtedly lead to difficulties in the\nenforcement of title VI,\nThese considerations, as I under-\nstand it, were among the principal ones\nwhich motivated the House in writing and\nadopting the provisions for Presidential\napproval in section 302. It was intended\nthat once White House scrutiny and approval\nof agency rules was required, inconsis-\ntencies of the kind referred to would be\ndiscovered and eliminated.\nIn view of the foregoing, I do not\nbelieve that the suggested amendment is\nnecessary.\nWe believe that the congressional purpose 40\nto promote uniformity was satisfied in the promulgation\nof the regulation under r:302, which uas approved by the\nPresident. That regulation established an administra-\ntive framework in the Department of Health, Education\nand Welfare basically similar to those established  in\nall the other federal agencies with responsibility\n-42-\n\nunder Title VI. See e q., 7 CFR, Part(cid:9) (Department\nof Agriculture); 15 CFR, Part C (Department of Commerce);\n32 CFR, Part 300 (Department of Defense); 43 CFR, Part 17\n(Department of the Interior); 29 CFR, Part 31 (Depart-\nment of Labor); and 22 CFR, Part 14i (Department of\nState). The President, who Congress loo17ed to for\nobtaining uniformity among the federal agencies, approved\na regulation for the Department of Health, Education and\nWelfare which uniquely gave the Commissioner of Educa-\ntion the power to determine the adequacy of desegregation\nplans for elementary and' secondary schools, and which did\nnot seek to circumscribe the Commissioner's ',udgment as\nto the specific content of these plans. Implicit in\nthis administrative ar=rangement is a recognition that\nthe desegregation of elementary and secondary schools\nmay require time, flexibility, and professional expertise,\nand a judgment that entrusting the Commissioner with\nthis responsibility and power would not be disruptive\nuniformity within the executive branch that Congress\ndesired. This judgment has been proved correct by\nexperience.(cid:9) If the existence and e:-ezcise of this power\nby the Commissioner to determine the adequacy of the\ndesegregation plans is not disruptive of the uniformity\nCongress entrusted the President to obtain, certainly the\nguidelines, a statement of the enforcement policies of\nthe Commissioner, would he no more dl sroptv of that\nuniformity.\n- 43 -\n\nIn conclusion, there is one further matter that\nshould be mentioned.

LANDSBERG\nAttorney\nDepartment of Justice\n\nHOW THE NEW LAWS AFFECT SOUTHERN SCHOOLS\nTitle VI: Southern Education Faces the Facts\nTitle Vl of the 1964 Civil Rights Act provides that racial discrimination must be ended in all programs that receive\nfederal financial assistance. Responsibility for administering this provision for most of the federal educational pro-\ngrams lies with the Office of Education of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Requests for federal\nsupport for these programs for the 1965-66 school year are note being prepared in thousands of communities in\nboth the North and the South. And in the process, the full import of the Civil Rights Act is becoming clear.\nThe South today is a society in agonizing transition. Ancient traditions and attitudes are slowly changing before\nthe onslaught of contemporary events. For a decade or more since the 1954 and 1955 Supreme Court decisions out-\nlawing segregation in the schools, the South has been moving with more deliberation than speed in bringing Negro\nand white together in the classroom. Slowly, but inexorably, however, efforts to avoid change have been swept\naway by the courts. The inevitability of full compliance with the Supreme Court's decision has become progres-\nsively clearer as one alternative after another has been attempted and has failed. Now Title VI opens another\nmajor act in the drama of school segregation. As one Florida news headline stated it, the issue for the seventeen\nSouthern states that receive more than $350 million annually for elementary and secondary school programs is:\n\"INTEGRATE—OR LOSE FEDERAL $$.\"\nThe issue appears clear—and, to the uninitiated, simple. Yet enforcement of Title VI is a complex matter. Its\npurpose is to build, not to destroy, to liberate, not to erect barriers. But harsh and unsympathetic enforcement\nof the letter of the law could be destructive. It could deny federal support to those children most desperately in need\nof it—and in the process exacerbate sectional feelings far beyond anything we have seen to date. Yet the law must\nbe enforced.\nAware of the complex responsibility assigned to it, the Office of Education has moved with its own version of\n\"all deliberate speed.\" To date it has been more notable for its caution than for its accomplishment in providing\nspecific direction to school authorities faced with the necessities of radical change under Title VI.\nThere are, to be sure, good reasons for caution. An official statement of well-defined standards for desegregation\nwould almost certainly he interpreted as an acceptable minimum, and fete if any school districts would feel obliged\nto move beyond them. Nor is it reasonable to expect equal action from communities in Mississippi or Alabama and\nthose in Kentucky or Tennessee. Yet it is difficult to justify unequal enforcement of the law. Meanwhile, Southern\nschool authorities are not receiving the guidance they need in charting their course in unfamiliar waters.\nThe following memo is designed to provide specific guidelines to school authorities seeking to meet the terms of\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Art. It was prepared by G. W. Faster, Jr., professor of law at the University of Wis-\nconsin and consultant to the Office of Education, who has- long been deeply concerned with the problems of education.\nMr. Foster's memo has no official status and does not bind the Office of Education in any fashion. Yet there is no\ndoubt that it reflects directly the thinking of the officials charged with the responsibility for enforcement of Title VI\nas it applies to education.\nSR hopes that Southern school authorities will find these guidelines helpful in making the fateful decisions that\nconfront them. And Northern readers will find, in the calm words and careful analysis of the memo, a clear\nview of the issues as they have evolved to (late.\nTHE ISSUE posed for Southern schools by Title VI of inapplicable to districts in the seventeen states which in 1954\n the 1964 Civil Rights Act is not whether they will de- maintained legally separated Negro and white schools since\n\t segregate.

No. 2457-N\nGEORGE C. WALLACE, et al.,(cid:9) )\nDefendants.\nSUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF OF THE UNITED STATES\nIn the course of oral argument on February 3,\n1967, the Court asked counsel to address themselves\nin supplemental briefs to two questions: first, whether\nthe distinction between de jure •segregation and de\nfacto segregation is sound, and, second, whether the\nfailure of the President to formally approve the guide-\nlines renders them invalid. We submit this brief in\nresponse to that request.\n\nI. The Distinction between De Jure and \nDe Facto Segregation \nDefendants maintain that the guidelines are\ninvalid because they violate sections 401(b)(cid:9) and\n.1./ \n407(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In response,\ncounsel for plaintiffs argued, in part, that these\nsections were not intended, nor should they be con-\nstrued, to limit the power of the Commissioner of Educa-\ntion to require the correction of de jure segregation,\nand that since the guidelines are confined solely to\nthat task, they do not exceed whatever limitations\nare imposed on the Commissioner's power by those sec-\ntions. It was maintained that, at the most, these\nsections are a limitation of the Commissioner's power\nto take corrective action with respect to de facto \nsegregation, with which the guidelines do not attempt\nto deal and which is not in any way involved in this\njj\"'Desegregation' means the assignment of students\nto public schools and within such schools without regard\nto their race, color, religion, or national origin,\nbut 'desegregation' shall not mean the assignment of\nstudents to public schools in order to overcome racial\nimbalance.\" 42 U.S.C. 2000c(b).\n\"[N]othing herein shall empower any official or\ncourt of the United States to issue any order seeking\nto achieve a racial balance in any school by requiring\nthe transportation of pupils or students from one\nschool to another or one school district to another in\norder to achieve such racial balance, or otherwise\nenlarge the existing power of the court to insure com-\npliance with constitutional standards.\" 42 U.S.C. 2000c-6(a)\n-\n\nlitigation. It was in response to this line of argu-\nment that the Court asked whether the distinction\nbetween de facto and de jure ftsegregation was meaning-\nful.\nAt the outset it should be noted that sections\n401(b) or 407(a) do not purport to limit the authority\nof either the Executive or Judicial Branch to take\naction to correct segregation in the public schools\nthat is prohibited by the Constitution. These sections were\nmerely included to disclaim any intention to create a\nstatutory source of authority to remedy \"racial imbalance\"\nin the public schools, which was viewed as a form of\nsegregation not prohibited by the Constitution.(cid:9) As\nSenator Humphrey stated, the pertinent language in §407(a)\nwas included \"to preclude an inference that the title\nconfers new authority to deal with 'racial imbalance'\nin schools. ...\" 110 Cong. Rec. 12714 (1964). The\ntext of §407(a) clearly manifests this intention. It\nstates that nothing contained therein shall empower the\njudiciary or executive offices from entering orders to\nA\nachieve racial balance or shall \"otherwise enlarge the\nexisting power of the court to insure compliance with\nconstitutional standards\". With respect to the judiciary,\nit might even be doubtful whether Congress could properly\nlimit the general equity powers of the federal courts in\n\na manner to prevent them from ordering a school board\nto take such measures as may be necessary and proper\nto remedy segregation that is violative of the Con-\nstitution. Cf. Yakus v. United States,321 U.S. 414, 460,\n468 (dissenting opinion of Rutledge, J.); Estep v. United\nStates, 327 U.S. 114, 125 (concurring opinion of Murphy, J.),\n132 (concurring opinion of Rutledge, J.). Nor do we\nbelieve that sections 401(b) and 407(a) limit the author-\nity of the Attorney General to commence suits to eliminate\nconstitutionally forbidden segregation in public schools\nor limit the authority of the Commissioner of Education\nto bring an end to constitutionally forbidden racial\nsegregation in public schools that are federally assisted.-1/\nWhile Congress has greater power to curtail the activities\nof these federal officials than it does to curtail the\nremedial powers of the federal courts, we find no indica-\ntion in the legislative history that, in these sections,\nCongress sought to treat the Executive differently than\nit treated the Judiciary or that it intended to limit\nthe great remedial purposes of the Civil Rights Act by\nlimiting the authority of the Executive to take appro-\npriate action in eliminating racial segregation that\nis prohibited by the Constitution. With respect to\n3J As explained more fully in our principal brief in\nthis case (pp. 23a-28), the percentage of Negro trans-\nferees used in the guidelines (45 C.F.R. §181.54) is\nnot an attempt by the Commissioner to correct \"racial\nimbalance,\" but merely an index guiding him in selecting\nthose freedom-of-choice desegregation plans which his\noffice will most carefully review.\n\nthe Commissioner of Education, such segregation would\nbe, by definition, a form of racial discrimination,\nwhich is prohibited by section 601 in all federal\nassisted activities and which the Commissioner is author-\nized and directed to remedy in section 602. See also\nSimkins v. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, 323 F.2d\n959 (4 Cir. 1963).\nCongress believed that there is a distinction\nbetween de jure and de facto segregation, and embodied it\nin the statute. Although the precise phrase \"de facto \nsegregation\" was not used, the term used, \"racial im-\nbalance,\" was viewed by Congress, as it is by the\ngeneral public, as a synonym. As Congressman Cramer\nsaid in explaining the pertinent language in section\n401(b):\nThe purpose is to prevent any semblance\nof congressional acceptance or approval of\nthe concept of \"de facto\" segregation or\nto include in the definition of \"desegre-\ngation\" any balancing of school attendance\nby moving students across school district\nlines to level off percentages where one\nrace outweighs another.\n110 Cong. Rec. 2280(1964)\nThis distinction was made because of the congressional\nunderstanding of the existing state of constitutional\ndoctrine. Congress was acting on the presumption that\nthe Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit correctly\nstated the course of judicial decision in Bell v.\nSchool City of Gary, Indiana, 324 F.2d 209 (7 Cir. 1963)\n\nthat a school board was under no constitutional duty\nto correct de facto segregation or racial imbalance.\nThat Court held that if school attendance zone lines\nare drawn without regard to race, but rather on the\nbasis of such factors as density of population, travel\ndistances, safety of the children, school operating\ncosts, and convenience to parents and children, the\nzone lines are constitutionally valid even though there\nis a racial imbalance in the schools due to the resi-\ndential patterns and the use of such criteria. The\nopinion of the Seventh Circuit was explicitly mentioned\nin the course of the congressional debate, and Senator\nHumphrey said by way of explaining section 407(a)z\nThe bill does not attempt to integrate the\nschools, but it does attempt to eliminate\nsegregation in the school systems. The\nnatural factors, such as density of\npopulation, and the distance that students\nwould have to travel are considered legiti-\nmate means to determine the validity of a\nschool district, if the school districts\nare not gerrymandered, and in effect\ndeliberately segregated. The fact that\nthere is a racial imbalance per se is\nnot something which is unconstitutional.\nThat is why we have atteipted to clarify\nit with the language of section 4.\n110 Cong. Rec. 12717 (1964)\nDe jure segregation was understood to be segregation\nthat is the result of an official policy of the school\nboard to separate the races in the public schools,\nto have one set of schools for Negro students and\nNegro teachers, and another set of schools for white\n\nstudents and white teachers. Brown v. Board of Educa-\ntion left no doubt as to the unconstitutionality of\nthat type of segregation.\nWe stress that although we reco..:ni,e\nthat Congress perceived a distinction in the state\nof the case-law with respect to the unconstitutionality\nof de facto and de lure segregation, we do not propose\nthat school boards in the South be held to a different\nconstitutional standard than those in any other part\nof the Country. Every school board in the United States\nis subject, we believe, to the same constitutional obli-\ngation -- to eliminate racial discrimination in the\noperation of its school system. This is the teaching of\nBlocker v. Board of Education of Manhassett, 226 F. Supp.\n203, remedy considered on rehearing, 229 F. Supp. 709\n(E.D. N.Y. 1964). There the Court found the school\nboard had engaged in racial discrimination in establish-\ning a single disproportionately small attendance zone\nfor one school, providing a single school for a dis-\nproportionately small student body, and adhering to\na rigid policy of not permitting students to transfer\nout of that zone, where, as a result of those policies\nand practices and residential segregation, virtually all\nthe Negroes in the community were assigned to that school\nand all the students in the school were Negro.\nThis was segregation by\n\nofficial state action that was forbidden by the Con-\nstitution and it would make no difference whether,\nfor other purposes, it was called \"de facto\" or\"de\niaro \nor whether it occurred in a school system in\nNew York rather than one in Alabama. In either case,\ncorrective action must be taken.\nWhile the ultimate constitutional standard is\nthe same for the Nation, it must be recognized, however,\nthat the application of this standard to different\nfacts will produce different results. Different\npractices require different remedies. For example,\na school board that has been operating under an official\npolicy to segregate the races, and pursuant to that\npolicy has assigned teachers to the schools on a\nracially segregated basis, might be required to take\nsteps not required of a school board that has not im-\nplemented such a policy, even in the unlikely event\nthat the racial distribution of the faculties among\nthe various schools in the two systems is the same.\nSimilarly, any school board that has determined the\nsite, the capacity and the grades of a school in\nsuch a manner so as to perpetuate racial segregation,\nshould be required to take steps to eliminate the\nsegregation attributable to its discriminatory action,\neven though similar steps would not be required of\nanother school board that did not engage in such\n\ndiscriminatory conduct, but which, solely because\nof other factors, such as the use of geographical\ncriteria and the existence of residential segrega-\ntion, also maintained some schools which were attended\nsolely by Negro students. We believe that the record\nin this case shows that all the student and faculty\nsegregation in the public schools in Alabama is attri-\nbutable to the racial discriminatory action of the\nlocal school boards and the defendant state officials,\nand that the enforcement program of the Commissioner\nof-Education and the relief we propose in Lee V. Macon \nCounty Board of Education arc(cid:9) appropriate means\nfor eliminating the effects of that action.\n\nII. The Requirement of Presidential Approval \nSection 602 of Title VI confers a rule-maing\npower on the Secretary of the Department of Health,\nEducation and Welfare, and it imposes a procedural\nrequirement that all exercises of that rule-mating power\nbe approved by the President. It authorizes and,\ndirects each federal agency extending federal financial\nassistance to issue \"rules, regulations or orders of\ngeneral applicability\" to impiement the prohititJons\nagainst racaal discrimination contained in that Title,\nand it also provides that \"[n]o such rule, regulation,\nor order shall become effective unless and until\napproved by the President.\" We contend that the guide-\nlines are not an exercise of this rule-maing power,\nLilt a mere statement of the enfol:cement po:Licies of\nthe Commissioner of Education, and that thus they need\nnot be approved by the President.(cid:9) Our posit3on is\nsupported, we believe, by traditional administrative\nlaw doctrine, by an analysis of the evolution and\nnature of the guidelines, and by a review cf the legis-\nlative history relating to the Lequirement cf presidential\napproval.\n\nA. The traditional distinction between \n\"Legislative Regulations\" and \"Inter-\npretative Regulations.\" \nExercises of a rule-making power granted to an\nadministrative agency by Congress have, according to\ntraditional administrative law doctrine, been called\n\"legislative regulations.\" See generally 1 Davis,\nAdministrative Law §§5.01-5.11 (1958). Legislative\nregulations are said to have \"the status of law\",\nwhich means that they are \"binding\" on individual\nparties, and even on a court if it is determined by\nthe court that they are (a) within the grant of the\nrule-making power, (b) reasonable, and (c) issued\npursuant to proper procedure.\nTraditional administrative law doctrine also\nrecognizes another category of agency announcements,\nwhich for lack of a better term have been called\n\"interpretative regulations.\" The phrase \"interpretative\nregulation\" is misleading because what is involved is\nnot a \"regulation\", a rule of law, but rather a judgment\nor !view of the agency on a particular question and it\nis also misleading because the distinction between a\n\"legislative regulation\" and a so-called \"interpretative\nregulation\" is not one related to the content of the agency\nannouncement. The content of a so-called interpretative\nregulation could equally be contained in a\nlegislative regulation. The\n\nessential difference between a legislative regulation\nand an interpretative regulation is \"whether or not it\nis issued pursuant to a grant of law-making power.\"\n1 Davis, Administrative Law p. 302 (1958)(cid:9) An inter-\npretative regulation is, as we understan it, a judg-\nment or policy statement of the agency that is not\nformally expressed in a rule or regulation issued pur-\nsuant to the statutory rule-making power of the agency.\nWe claim no more status for the guidelines than\nthat of so-called interpretative regulations, and it\nis therefore important to note the..r characteristics\nin some detail.\nFirst, and most importantly, because so-called\ninterpretative regulations are not an eercise of\nwhatever rule-making power may be given to an agency,\nthey, unlike legislative regulations, do not have the\n\"status of law\" nor are they \"binding.\" They are subject\nto plenary review by a court, and a court can substitute\nits judgment for that of the administrative agency on\n• the issue resolved in the interpretative regulations.\nThe so-called interpretative regulations are \"authori-\ntative\" in only two respects: (a) They guide the\nenforcement action of the administrative agency.\nAlthough the agency is theoretically free to disregard\n\nor alter these statements of policy in specific cases,\nor at any time in the future, in the interest of fair-\nness ane of establishing continuity and confidence in\nits enforcement program, as a practical matter, they\nare a generally reliable guide to what the agency's\nenforcement action wiL. Le and wh • t the agency thinks\nLI/\nit(cid:9) should be.(cid:9) (b) The so-called interpretative regula-\ntions have the power to persuade the judiciary. They\nrepresent the judgment of the administrative agency,\nand the courts can look to them for guidance. Their\nauthoritativeness in this respect will vary depending\non such factors as the extent to which the subject\nmatter is within the special competence of the administra-\ntive agency, its consistency with prior administrative\npronouncements and with standards announced by the\ncourts in construing the same or s milar concepts,\ni\nthe experience of the agency, the thoroughness in the\nconsideration of the regulation by the agency, and the\nfairness and informativeness of the procedures used\nby the agency in formulating its position.. See generally\nThe practical impact of the \"interpretative regula-\nlation\" on the conduct of the effected parties does not\nalter their nature. For example, in Frozen Food' Express \nv. United States, 351 U.S. 40, 44, 45 (i_50), the Supreme\nCourt recognied thae4o-called interpretative regulation\nof the Interstate Commerce Commission, which was issued as\n\"Report\" entitled \"Determination of Exempted Agricultural\nCommodities\", would have \"an immediate and practical\nimpact on carriers\", since the carriers could act contrary\nto the policies stated in Report only \"at the risk of in-\ncurring criminai penalties.\" See Jaffe, Judicial. Control \nof Administrative Action, pp. 4C5-403 (l';65), discussng\nthe case.\n- 13 -\n\nPO \nSkidmore v, Swift & Co., 323 U S. 134,  (1\"A4)\n(involving the \"Interpretative Lulletins\" of the\nAdministrator of the .ages and Hours Division of the\nDepartment of Labor, from which Congress, in enacting\nthe Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, withheld a general\nrule-making power).\nSecond, in issuing so-called interpretative\nregulations no formal procedures, including the\nprocedures MEM prescrihedby statute for th. exercise\nof the statutory rule-making power need be followed.\nSection 4 of the Administrative Procedures Act, for\nexample, expressly states that the notice and hearing\nrequirements imposed Ly that statute for rule-making\nshall not apply to \"interpretative rules, general\nstatements of policy, [and] rules of agency ooganiza-\ntion, procedure, or practice.\"--1/ The procedural require-\nments may be ignored, and the agency may be relieved of\nthe necessity of complying with them only at the cost of\nlessening the authoritativeness of its rulthg or judgment.\n_5/ \n5 U.S.C. 1003(a)(1964 Ed.) The Senate Committee in-\ndicated that it understood the technical meaning of the\nphrase \"interpretative rules.\" See Senate Committee\nPrint, Sen. Doc. No. 248, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 18\n(1943). The distinction between legislative and inter-\nprotative regulations was well recognized in the scholarly\nliterature at the time. See, e.g., Lee, Legislative and\nInterpretative Regulations, 20 Geo. L.J. 1 (140); and\nRep. Att'y. Gen. Comm. Ad. Proc. 90-100 (1341), quoted\nin Americal President Lines, Ltd. v. Federal Maritime \nCommission, 316 F.26 413, 422 (D.C. Cir., 1963).\n\nThe scope of judicial review is substantially broadened\nbecause these rulings or judgments are not issued\npursuant to the rule-making power in conformity to the\nprocedural requirements for exercising that power.\nThird, the so-called interpretative regulations\nmay be published in many forms. They may consist of\ngeneral policy statements of the agency, press releases,\nletters of opinion, speeches, pamphlets, handbooks,\nbulletins, or instructions, or they may find more formal\nexpression and actually be designated \"regulations\"\nby the administrative agency. The mere fact that the\npolicy or judgment of the agency is of gene:Lai applica-\nbility and is published in the Federal Register or in\nthe Code of Federal Regulations does not alter their\nnature, making them an exercise of a statutory rule-\nmaking power. For example, the Interpretative Bulletin\nof the Wage and Hour Division, the classic example of the.\nso-called interpretative regulation involve& in Skidmore \nv. Swift & Co., is of general applicability, stating\nthe administrator's views as to the coverage of the\nAct, and is published in the Code of Federal Regula-\ntionseL/\n_.6./ \nSee 29 C.F.R„ Parts 775 and(cid:9) For other exampes\nas to the form of so-called interpretative regulations\nsee generally 1 Davis, Administrative Law, p. 290 n,2C\n(\"The Federar Register for SeptemLer 27,(cid:9) contains\na large compilation of SEC interpretative regulations\nand related materials, called releases, letters or\nopinion of officers, letters of the Commission, statements\nof the Commission, and the like\"), p. 30.. (\"Nearly all\nthe regulations issued by the Secretary of Agriculture\nunder the Food and Drug Act of •9G.,> concerning standards\nfor food were interpretative--merely a 'guide for officials\nof this department in enforcing the Food and Drug /et\"),\nand p. 311 (discussing the fact that both interpretative\nan& legislative regulations of the Treasury Departm nt\ne\nare published in the Federal Register an& the Code of\nFederal Regulati ons).\n\nThe nature of this traditional administrative\nlaw category called \"interpretative regulations\" can\nbe further illustrated by discussing a leading case,\nGibson Wine Co., Inc. v. Snyder, 194 F.2d 32D, decided\nin 1952 by the Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumtia, a court that has played a prominent role in\nthe formulation of administrative law in our country.\nThat case involved a challenge to the ruling of the\nDeputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue, who was\ncharged with the administration of the Federal Alcohol\nAdministration Act.-3 The pertinent statute granted\nhim a rule-ma},-ing power, but required that exercises\nof that power be approved by the Secretary of the\nTreasury. A formal regulation had been issued sometime\nLL/\t\nSection 2(d) of the Federal Alcohol. Administration\nAct, 49 Stat. 977 (1935) provides:\nThe Administrator is authorized\nand, directed to prescrile such rules\nand regulations as may be necessary\nto carry out his powers and duties.\nAll rules and regulations presorii.ed\nby the administrator shall be subject\nto the approval of the Secretary of\nthe Treasury.\nThe Court of Appeals, 194 F.2d. at 330 n.2 states:\nThe Federal Alcohol Administration\nand the office of the Administrator\nwere abolished and their functions\ntransferred to the Alcohol Tax Unit\nof the Bureau of Internal Revenue\nand the Deputy Commissioner of\nInternal Revenue in charge of that\nunit.\n16 -\n\nago with the approval of the Secretary, tut that regL0a-\ntion merery stated that a wine made from one Icind of\nfruit shall be designated by the word \"wine\" qualified\nby the name of the fruit. The question frequently\narose as to whether wine made from boysenberries should\nbe labelled \"blackberry wine\" or \"boysenberry wine.\"\nThere was no provision in the formal legislative regula-\ntion covering this issue and accordingly the Deputy\nCommissioner ruled, stating that such wine should he\nlabelled \"boysenberry wine.\" That ruling was not\napproved by the Secretary. The District Court reviewed\nthe ruling of the Deputy Commissionei on a ptenary\nconcluded that the ruling was \"correct\" and denied the\nplaintiff-appellant injunctive relief. The Court of\nAppeals affirmed, saying (194 F.20, at 331-332):\nThe first point presented by\nappellant is that the Deputy\nCommissioner's ruling of November 30,\n1943, was an attempt to modify or\namend a regulation and was invalid\nbecause it was not approved Lv the \nSecretary, as required by the statute,\nand no hearing was had prior to the\npromulgation of the ruling, as\nrequired by the statute and by\nSection 4 of the Administrative Pro-\ncedure Act. The appellee officials\nsay that the Deputy Commissioner's\nruling was not an amendment or modi-\nfication of a regulation but was merely\nan interpretative ruling. They say\nthat interpretative rulings are within\nthe authority of the Deputy Commis-\nsioner and are not within statutory\nrequirements as to notice and hearing.\n- 17 -\n\nThe distinctive characteristics\nof interpretative rulings, as con-\ntrasted with so-called regulations,\nhave long been recognied. Adminis-\ntrative officials frequently announce\ntheir views as to the meaning of\nstatutes or regulations. Generally\nspeaking, it seems to be established\nthat 'regulations', 'sukstantive\nrules' or 'legislative rules' are\nthose which create law, usually\nimplementary to an existing law;\nwhe.,:eas interpretative rules are\nstatements as to what the adminis-\ntrative officer thinks the statute\nor regulations means.\n*\nWe think the ruling of the Deputy\nCommissioner here under consideration\nwas clearly an interpretative ruling,\nOn its face it purported to be merely\nthe opinion of the Deputy Commissioner\nas to the meaning of the regulation.\nIn the action in the District Court\nth.,, parties and the court treated it\nas an expression of opinion, We\nthink that treatment was correct.\nSince the Deputy Commissioner's\nruling was an interpretative one, it\nwas not subjct to the requirements\nof approval by the Secretary, of a\nhearing prior to promulgation, or of\nthe rule-making pIocedure of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act. Such\nexemptions have effect on the weight\nwhich the courts will accord to the\nadministrative view and thus affect\nthe limits of the judicial review....\n(Footnotes giving statutory references\nomitted and emphasis added.)\nSee also Garelic Mfq. Co. v. Wellon, 313 F.26 899\n(D.C. Cir.,1953).\n\nB. The Guidelines as a Public Statement \nof the Enforcement Policies of the \nCommissioner of Education.\nThe guidelines are not an exercise of the rule-\nmaking power conferred on the agency by Congress in\nsection 602. They are a public statement of the\npolicies that will generally guide the Commissioner\nof Education in discharging his res ponsibility under\nthe Act and the regulation that was issued under §602\nto determine the adequacy of desegregation plans sub-\nmitted to him. They are rules for the management of\nhis shop, and thus fall in the traditional category\nin administrative law of the so-called \"interpretabitie\nregulations,\" which, as discussed in the preceding\nsection of this brief, are not regulations or rules\nof law regulating the behavior of others.\nWe believe this Court need determine whether the\nguidelines are \"valid\" only in the limited sense of\nwhether they are a permissible basis upon which the\nCommissioner can base his enforcement action. Thus,\ntheir validity depends, not upon whether they were\nissued in conformity with the procedural requirements\nset forth in section 602 for exercising the statutory\nrule-making power, but rather on their consistency\nwith the substantive provisions of the statute and\nregulation. The essence of the defendants' position,\n19\n\nn/\nboth in enacting Act No. 252 of the Alabama Legislature\nand in their third party claim, is that the guidelines\nare invalid because they violate Title IV by requiring\nthe correction of racial imbalance and because they seek\nto correct \"employment practices\" in violation of section\n604 of Title VI. This should be the focus of this litiga-\ntion, and we meet those contentions in our principal brief\nin this case.\nMoreover, it should be recognized that this Court\nis being asked to determine the validity of the guidelines\nonly on their face. This means that even if this Court\nin this proceeding determines that the guidelines are\n\"valid\" in that they are consistent with the substantive\nprovision of the Act and the Regulation, it is still open\nto local school boards to assert, and for the courts to\ndecide, in particular cases whether the enforcement policies\nof the Commissioner, asepplied, are consistent with whatever\n3/ The operative provisions of Act No. 252 are con-\ntained in section 1, and read in part:\n\"Any agreement or assurance of compliance with the\nguidelines heretofore made or given by a local\ncounty or city Board of Education is null and void\nand shall have no binding effect. No local\ncounty or city Board of Education shall have the\nauthority to give any assurance of compliance with\nthe guidelines or to enter into any other agree-\nment with any agency of the government of the\nUnited States which would obligate such local\ncity or county Board of Education to adopt any\nplan for desegregation which requires the assign-\nment of students to public schools in order to\novercome racial imbalance or which would authorize\nany agent of the United States to take any unlawful\naction lAth respect to any employment practice of\nsuch board or to take other action not required\nby law.\"\n- 20 -\n\nlimitations may be in the statute respecting racial\nimbalance and employment practices. In addition, a court\nreviewing specific administrative action will be called\nin to decide questions not at all presented in this\nlitigation, namely, whether these enforcement policies\nare arbitrary or unreasonable as applied and whether the\nCommissioner is mistaken in his judgment as to what is\nrequired in a particular situation to eliminate racial\ndiscrimination in the operation of the public school\nsystem. In fact, in such a proceeding to review a\nspecific action of the Commissioner based on these guide-\nlines or policies, the court has the power to undertake\na plenary review of the Commissioner's policies and standards,\nand to determine whether, in its judgment, compliance with\nthose standards and policies is required to eliminate\nracial discrimination. This broad scope of judicial\nreview is appropriate and fair because the guidelines are\nnot an exercise of the statutory rule-making power con-\ntained in section 602. To be sure, as the Supreme Court\nin Skidmore v. Swift & Co. recognized, a reviewing court\nmay look to the guidelines \"for guidance\" as \"a body of\nexperiences and informed judgment,\" and \"the weight of\nsuch a judgment in a particular case will depend upon\n• •(cid:9) all those factors which give it power to per-\nsuade.\" 323 U.S., at 140.\n- 21 -\n\nThe formai title and Language of the gajdeines\nindicate that they are a pul is statement of the enf r)-ce-\nment policies of the Commissioner of Education not\nreguiatons o rW_es of 'aw(cid:9) For e;. :amp e the sect--.:)n\nthat ma es reference to percentages of Negro -transferees,\nl\nwhich section is perhaps the portion of the guidelines most\nin controversy in this litigation, males it unmistakably\nclear that only the enforcement policies of the Commis-\nsioner, not regulations or rules of law, are being set\nforth. That section reads:\n3181.54 Requirements for Effectiveness of\nFree Choice Plans\nA free choice Wan tends to place the\nburden of desegregation on Negro or other\nminority group students and their parents\nEven when scho& authorities underta/re good\nfaith efforts to assure its fair operation,\nthe very nature of a free choice plan and\nthe effect of longstanding community\nattitudes often tend to preclude or inhibit\nthe exercise of a truly free choice by or for\nminority group students.\nFor these reasons, the Commissioner\nwill scrutinize with special care the\noperation of voluntary plans of desegrega-\ntion in school systems which have adopted\nfree choice plans.\nIn determining whether a free choice\nplan is operating fairly and effectively,\nso as to materially further the orderly\nachievement of desegregation, the Commis-\nsioner will take into account such factors\nas community support for the plan, the\nefforts of the school system to eliminate\nthe identifiability of schools on the basis\nof race, color, or national origin by virtue\nof the composition of staff or other factors,\nand the progress actually made in elimi-\nnating past discrimination and segregation\n- 22 -\n\nThe single most substantial indication\nas to whether a free choice plan is actually\nworking to eliminate the dual school structure\nis the extent to which Negro or other minority\ngroup students have in fact transferred from\nsegregated schools. Thus, when substantial\ndesegregation actually occurs under a free\nchoice plan, there is strong evidence that\nthe plan is operating effectively and fairly,\nand is currently acceptable as a means of\nmeeting legal requirements. Conversely,\nwhere a free choice plan results in little\nor no actual desegregation, or where, having\nalready produced some degree of desegregation,\nit does not result in substantial progress,\nthere is reason to believe that the plan is\nnot operating effectively and may not be an\nappropriate or acceptable method of meeting\nconstitutional and statutory requirements.\nAs a general matter, for the 1.366-..7\nschool year the Commissioner will, in the\nabsence of other evidence to the contrary,\nassume that a free choice plan is a viable\nand effective means of completing initial\nstages of desegregation in school systems\nin which a substantia l_ percentage of the\nstudents have in fact been transferred from\nsegregated schools. Where a small degree\nof desegregation has been achieved and, on\nthe basis of the free choice registration\nheld in the spring of 1956, it appears that\nthere will not be a substantial increase in\ndesegregation for the 1966-67 school year,\nthe Commissioner will review the working of\nthe 'Dian and will normally require school\nofficials to take additional actions as a\nprerequisite to continued use of a free\nchoice plan, even as an interim device.\nIn districts with a sizable percentage\nof Negro or other minority group students, the\nCommissioner will, in general, be guided by\nthe following criteria in scheduling free\nchoice plans for review:\n(1) If a significant percentage of the\nstudents, such as 8 percent or 3 percent,\ntransferred from segregated schools for the\n1955-63 school year, total transfers on the\norder of at least twice that percentage would\nnormally be expected.\n\n(2) If a smaller percentage of the\nstudents, such as 4 percent or 5 percent,\ntransferred from segregated schools for\nthe 1955-63 school year, a substantial\nincrease in transfers would normally be\nexpected, such as would bring the total\nto at least triple the percentage for the\n1955-33 school year.\n(3) If a lower percentage of students\ntransferred for the 1965-55 school year, then\nthe rate of increase in total transfers for the\n1956-67 school year would normally be ex-\npected to be proportionately greater than\nunder (2) above.\n(4) If no students transferred from\nsegregated schools under a free choice plan\nfor the 1935-56 school year, then a very\nsubstantial start would norma:,ly be expected,\nto enable such a school system to catch up as\nquickly as possible with systems which started\nearlier. If a school system in these circum-\nstances is unable to make such a start for the\n1966-57 school year under a free choice plan,\nit will normally be required to adopt a different\ntype of plan.\nWhere there is substantial deviation from\nthese expectations, and the Commissioner con-\ncludes, on the basis of the choices actually\nmade and other available evidence, that the\nplan is not operating fairly, or is not effec-\ntive to meet constitutional and statutory\nrequirements, he `rail!_ require the school\nsystem to take additional steps to further\ndesegregation.\nSuch additional steps may include, for\nexample, reopening of the choice period,\nadditional meetings with parents and civic\ngroups, further arrangements with State or\nlocal officials to limit opportunities for\nintimidation, and other further community\npreparation. Where schools are still\nidentifiable on the basis of staff composi-\ntion as intended for students of a particular\nrace, color, or national origin, such steps\nmust in any such case include substantia'L\nfurther changes in staffing patterns to\neliminate such identifiability.\n- 24\n\nIf the Commissioner concludes that\nsuch steps would be ineffective, or if\nthey fail to remedy the defects in the\noperation of any free choice plan, he may\nrequire the school system to adopt a\ndifferent type of desegregation plan\nSimilarly, the way in which the guidelines evolved\nmal:es clear that they are merely a statement of the enforce-\nment policies of the Commissioner, and that they were made\npublic for the purpose of assisting the 'ocal school.\nboards.\nTitle VI, as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\nwas enacted in July, 1934. The next several months were\nspent in establishing the appropriate enforcement\nmachinery in the agencies and in drafting the regulation\nto be issued pursuant to the ,;,302 rule-making power,\nOn November 27, 1934, the Secretary of the Department\nof Health, Education and Welfare issued, with the approval\nof the President, a regulation establishing the basic\nlegal framework for the enforcement of Title VI by his\n9 /\ndepartment.(cid:9) 45 C.F.R., part 80. Section 8C.4(c)(2)\nrequired certain school districts to submit desegregation\nplans to the Commissioner of Education and it charged\nthe Commissioner with the responsibility of determining\nwhether the desegregation plans submitted were adequate\nto accomplish the purpose of Title VI and the regulation\n-- the elimination of racial **segregation, The relevant\nportion of the regulation reads:\n_9_/ Notice or hearing was not required for the promulga-\ntion of the regulation because section 4 of the Administra-\ntive Procedure Act exempts from the notice and hearing\nrequirements of that section \"any matter re l ating to .\nloans, grants, benefits or contracts, 5 U.SC. 003\n(1964 ed.)\n- 25 -\n\n(c) Elementary and Secondary schools.

(2) submits a plan for the desegregation\nof such school or school system which the\nCommissioner of Education determines is ade-\nquate to accomplish the purposes of the Act\nand this Regulation and provides reasonaL'e\nassurance that it wL.1 carry out such plan\nThe regulation did not seek to spell out what such a\nplan must include, but instead relied upon the judgment\nof the Commissioner of Education. The regulation re-\nquired the school boards to take the first affirmative\nsteps in formulating desegregation plans and to submit\nthem for approval to the Commissioner. However, sec-\ntion 80.12(b) of the regulation directs the Commissioner,\nas the responsible department official, to issue to\ninterested persons \"forms and detailed instructions and\nprocedures\" for effectuating the regulation.\nIn December, 1964, almost contemporaneous/1i with\nthe publication of this regulation in the Federal Register,\ninstructions were sent to local school systems describing\nthe requirements of the Act and of the reguation.\nShortly thereafter, a memorandum entit -ted \"Supplementary\nInformation for School Districts Regarding Compliance\nwith Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1934: Non-\ndiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs\" was sent\nto local school systems to clarify certain ambiguities\nin the earlier. instructions. See e.g., Weaver Dep, U,S.\nEx. 11. With respect to desegregation plans, the\nmemorandum said:\n- 26 -\n\nE. Desegregation Plans \nThe responsibility for devising and\nimplementing a reasonable and adequate\nplan of desegregation rests with the\nlocal school district, although all must\ncomply with the Civil Rights Act.\nThe actions required to undertake the\ndesegregation of a school system may differ\nfrom community to community. Neveftheless,\nunder the provisions of the Civil Rights\nAct and the HEW Regulation, the Commissioner\nof Education must review any plan of desegrega-\ntion submitted to determine its adequacy to\naccomplish the purposes of the Act and the\nRegulation.\nNo one set of guidelines or instructions\ncan be devised which will fit all situations.\nTechnical assistance on the formulation of a\nplan can be obtained on request from the\nOffice of Education. Where local circumst-\nances raise special problems, such proL!ems\nshould be set forth in the plan together with\nthe particular solutions proposed to deal with\nthem.\nA need was soon recognized for the articulation\nof some of the standards that were to be used by the\nCommissioner of Education in judging the adequacy of\ndesegregation plans. In response to this need a\nmemorandum by F. W. Foster, Jr., Professor of Lay at\nthe University of Wisconsin and a consultant to the\nOffice of Education, was published on March 20, 1935\nin a magazine called the Saturday Review. (A copy of\nthe article, of which we asb this court to take judicial\nnotice, is attached.) The editorial preface to the\narticle states:\n- 27 -\n\nThe following memo is designed to\nprovide specific guidelines to school\nauthorities seeking to meet the terms of\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act_ .\nMr. Foster's memo has no officiai status\nand does not bind the Office of Education\nin any fashion_ Yet there is no doubt\nthat it affects directly the thinking of\nthe officials charged with the responsi-\nbility for the enforcement of Title VI as\nit applies to education.\nOne month later, on April 29, 1035, the Commis-\nsioner of Education in response to this same demand for\nan articulation of his enforcement policies issued and\ndistributed to all school districts that had sulmitted\nan unacceptab.e plan, or that were in the process of\npreparing a plan, a document that has become to be known\nas the 1965 guidelines. It was formally entit ed \"General\nl\nStatement of Policies Under Title VI of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1954 Respecting Desegregation of Elementary and\nSecondary Schools.\" At that time, the statement was\nnot published in the Federal. Register. However, with\ntime a need was recognized to make the statement more\navailah-e to the pubJic, and in August(cid:9) 5 it was\npublished in the Federal Register. 30 Fed, Reg. 39ei\n(August 11, 1935); 30 Fed. Reg. *0153 (August 14, 1905).\nThe nature and, purpose of the statement were clearly set\nforth in the Federal Registe:\nUnder 00.4(c) of the regulation\nissued by the Secretary and approved 3:y\nthe President (45 CFR C0.4(c), the\nCommissioner has authority and responsi-\nbility for_ determining whether a desegrega-\ntion plan submitted hy an elementary or\n- 28 -\n\nsecondary school or school system desiring\nto receive Federal. financial assistance is\nadequate to carry out the puoposes of\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of -114\n,(cid:9) . and the implementing regulation.\n. . . The following Part 100 describes\nthe policies under which the Commissioner\nwill make such determinations.\nIn order to conform his enforcement policies to\nhis experience during the first year of operation of the\nTitle VI program, the Commissioner in March, 1956, issued\na revised set of guidelines, entitled \"Revised Statement\nof Policies for School Desegregation Plans under Title VI\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1934.\" They were published in\nthe Federal Register on April 9, 1366 (31 Fed. Reg. 5:,23),\nwith an explanation essentially similar to that which\nappeared upon the publication of the 1965 guidelines in\nthe Federal Register.\n\nC. The Legislative History of the \nRequirement of Presidential \nApproval.\nWe do not believe that the legislative history\nconcerning the requirement of presidential approval\nis particularly instructive. We do believe, however,\nthat it is consistent with our position and the fore-\ngoing analysis. First, there is no indication that\nCongress intended to preclude the Secretary from issuing\nrules and regulations under §602 which require school\ndesegregation plans to be submitted to the Commissioner\nof Education as a condition of the extension of financial\nassistance for education, and which charge the Commissioner\nwith determining whether the plans are adequate to fulfill\nthe purposes of the Act. Second, there is no indication\nthat Congress intended to have the Commissioner, in exer-\ncising this function, to be without discretion to formu-\nlate enforcement policies and to be totally controlled\nby regulations issued by the Secretary and approved by\nthe President. The following analysis of the legisla-\ntive history supports these contentions.\n- 30 -\n\n(1) Genisis of the Requirement of Presidential\nApproval.\nThe requirement of presidential approval was not\nin the bill as introduced in the House by Congressman\n10 /\nCeller on June 20, 1963,(cid:9) nor in the version introduced\non October 2, 1963 and reported out of Committee to the\n11 /\nHouse for debate on November 20, 1963.(cid:9) The latter\n10/ \"Title VI -- Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted\nAssisted Programs\n\"Section 601. Notwithstanding any provision to the\ncontrary in any law of the United States providing or author-\nizing direct or indirect financial assistance for or in\nconnection with any program or activity by way of grant,\ncontract, loan, insurance, guaranty, or otherwise, no such\nlaw shall be interpreted as requiring that such financial\nassistance shall be furnished in circumstances under which\nindividuals participating in or benefiting from the program\nor activity are discriminated against on the ground of race,\ncolor, religion, or national origin or are denied par-\nticipation or benefits therein on the ground of race,\ncolor, religion, or national origin. All contracts made\nin connection with any such program or activity shall con-\ntain such conditions as the President may prescribe for\nthe purpose of assuring that there shall be no discrimination\nin employment by any contractor or subcontractor on the\nground of race, color, religion, or national origin.\"\n11/ The pertinent portion of the bill reads:\n\"Section 602. Each Federal department and agency\nwhich is empowered to extend Federal financial assistance\nto any program or activity, by way of grant, contract,\nor loan, shall take action to effectuate the provisions\nof Section 601 with respect to such program or activity.\nSuch action may be taken by or pursuant to rule, regulation,\nor order of general applicability and shall be consistent\nwith achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing\nthe financial assistance in connection with which the\naction is taken:\n31\n1F\n\nversion provided that administrative action to effectuate\nthe nondiscrimination requirement of the Title \"may be\ntaken by or pursuant to rule, regulation or order of\ngeneral applicability.\" In the course of debate on\nFebruary 7, 1964, Congressman Lindsay offered an amend-\nment to this version adding a requirement that the rule,\nregulation or order of general applicability be approved\nby the President.\nThe following is the entire discussion on the\nfloor of the House that preceded the adoption of the\namendment (110 Cong. Rec. 2499):\nMr. LINDSAY. Mr. Chairman, I offer an\namendment.\nThe Clerk read as follows:\nAmendment offered by Mr. Lindsay: On\npage 62, line 17, after the words \"is taken\"\ninsert \"no such rule, regulation or order\nshall become effective unless and until ap-\nproved by the President;',\nThe CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from New York\n[Mr. Lindsay] is recognized.\nMr. LINDSAY. Mr. Chairman, this amend-\nment is designed to require that the President\nshall approve rules and regulations that are\npromulgated pursuant to Section 602 of Title\nVI.\nI believe this amendment will be accepted\nby the chairman of the Committee on the Judi-\nciary and the ranking minority member. The\nmembers of your committee feel that the rule-\nmaking power is so important in this area\nand can be so significant because of the\nlatitude that this title by definition has to\ngive to the executive in drafting rules and\nregulations that the Chief Executive should\nbe required to put his stamp of approval on\n32\n\nsuch rules and regulations - after, of course,\nthe normal procedures have been followed in\npromulcjating such rules and regulations.\nMr. CELLER. Mr. Chairman, will the\ngentleman yield?\nMr. LINDSAY. I yield to the chairman of\nthe committee.\nMr. CELLER. As chairman of the Judiciary\nCommittee, I aprprove the amendment of the\ngentleman from New York.\nMr. LINDSAY. I thank the chairman.\nMr. McCULLOCH. Mr. Chairman, will the\ngentleman yield?\nMr. LINDSAY. I yield to the gentleman\nfrom Ohio.\nMr. McCULLOCH. The amendment is an\nacceptable amendment to us.\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. Mr. Chairman,\nexplanation\nI should like to have a brief \nof what the amendment would do.\nMr. LINDSAY. I yield to the gnetleman\nfrom Virginia.\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. I thought the\ngentleman had yielded the floor.\nMr. LINDSAY. I had not yet yielded the\nfloor. If the gentleman would like the floor\non his own time, I shall be glad to yield the\nfloor.\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. No.I should merely\nlike to have a more clear idea as to what the\namendment would do.\nIs it the gentleman's thought or intent\nthat the President shall personally approve\nevery regulation that is made under this\nregulatory power?\nMr. LINDSAY. No, it is not.\n- 33 -\n\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. What would it\ndo, then?\nMr. LINDSAY. Pursuant to Title VI, rules\nand regulations will have to be promulgated,\nas the gentleman will note on lines 14 and 15\non page 62 of the bill. The rules, regulations\nand orders there required, which will have to\nbe promulgated according to standard procedures,\nwith hearing and the rest, would have to be\napproved by the President of the United States.\nMr. SMITH.of Virginia. Then he would have\nto approve every one of these regulations\npersonally.\nMr. LINDSAY. No; I did not say that.\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. I thought the\ngentleman did.\nMr. LINDSAY. The rules and regulations will\nbe promulgated, and will have to be promulgated\nas indicated on the lines 14 and 15 as I have\nmentioned, and are to be approved by the\nPresident of the United States if they are to\nbe effective.\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. Did the gentleman\nnot just say they had to be approved by the\nPresident?\nMr. LINDSAY. That is correct.\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. Then what does\nthat mean? Would he have to approve them or\nwould he not have to approve them?\nMr. LINDSAY. I refer the gentleman again\nto the language to which I referred, on lines\n13 through 17 of page 62.\n\"Such action may be taken by or pursuant\nto rule, regulation, or order of general ap-\nplicability and shall be consistent with\nachievement of the objectives of the statute\nauthorizing the financial assistance in con-\nnection with which the action is taken.\nIt is those rules, regulations, or orders\nof general applicability the President would be\nrequired to approve. Very plainly stated.\n- 34 -\n\nMr. SMITH of Virginia. Perhaps so. I\nstill do not understand what the President\nwould have to do, but I am happy to see any\namendment agreed to by the gentleman from\nMr. \nNew York  Celled and the gentleman from\nOhio [Mr. McCulloch], so I am disposed to go\nalong with it. I only wish I could get them\nto agree on my amendment to prohibit slavery.\nPOFF. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman\nyield?\nMr. LINDSAY. I yield to the gentleman\nfrom Virginia.\nMr. PrFF. Mr. Chairman, I am inclined to\nfeel that the amendment is constructive in\nnature. I inquire, for the sake of the public:\nHow will the President document his approval\nof the orders and regulations? Will his approval\nappear as an Executive order? Will it he pub-\nlished in the Federal Register\nMr. LINDSAY. It will he published in the\nFederal Register.\nMr. POFF. I thank the gentleman.\nMr. JONES of Missouri. Mr. Chairman, I\nmove to strike out the last word, for the\npurpose of clarifying the statement of the\ngentleman from New York.\nI should like to have the attention of\nthe gentleman from New York [Mr. Lindsay].\nIt seems, after you offered your amend-\nment, you started wiggling around. I will read\nwhat the amendment says. I got a copy from\nthe Clerk's desk. It says.\nor \n\"No such rule, regulation  order shall\nbecome effective unless and until approved by\nthe President.\"\nDoes it mean that the President has to\napprove every rule before it will become\neffective?\n- 35 -\n\nMr. LINDSAY. That is correct; if it is\napplicable to this title and is of general\napplicability.\nMr. JONES of Missouri. The amendment\nsays:\n\"No such rule * * * shall become effective\nunless and until approved by the President.\"\nMr. LINDSAY. That is correct.\nkr. JONES of Missouri. Is that not what\nthe amendment says?\nMr. LINDSAY. That is correct.\nMr. JONES of Missouri. You ought to be\nable to answer the question \"Yes\" or \"No.\"\nMr. LINDSAY. It must be a rule, regulation,\nor order of general applicability. If it is not\na rule, regulation, or order of general appli-\ncability, I would assume that the President\nwould not have to put his approval on it.\nMr. JONES of Missouri. T e \"such\" refers\ni\nback to that, but you were trying to wiggle out\nof it in the discussion of the amendment.\nMr. LINDSAY. Then, vote against the\namendment if you do not like it.\nMr. JONES of Missouri. No. I am like\nJudge Smith. I want to do anything I can to\nimprove this thing. Of course, I will vote\nagainst the bill.\nMr. LINDSAY. If the gentleman will yield\nfurther, I am sure he is trying to improve it,\nand we appreciate it.\nMr. JONES of Missouri. I am trying to\nmake it \"less worse.\"\nI yield back the balance of my time.\nThe CHAIRMAN. The question is on the\namendment offered by the gentleman from New\nYork [Mr. Lindsay].\nThe amendment was agreed to.\n- 36 -\n\nNo further changes in the presidential approval\nrequirement were made in the course of the House debate,\nand on February 10, 1934, the bill passed the House (cid:9) 110\nCong. Rec. 2805. The pertinent portion of what is now\nSection 602 read:\nEach Federal department and agency which\nis empowered to extend Federal financial\nassistance to any program or activity, ly way\nof grant, loan, or contract other than a\ncontract of insurance or guaranty, shall tale\naction to effectuate the provisions of\nsection 301 with respect to such program or\nactivity. Such action may be talen by or\npursuant to rule, regulation, or order of\ngeneral applicability and shall be con-\nsistent with achievement of the objectives\nof the statute authorizing the financial\nassistance in connection with which the\naction is ta*ften. No such rule, regulation\nor order shall become effective unless and\nuntil approved by the President,\nWhen the House bill came up for debate in the\nSenate, Senator Dirksen, on May 25, 1934, introduced\nan amendment in the nature of a substitute. 110 Cong.\nRec. 11925, His substitute changed the relevant portion\nof section 502 to read as follows (id., at -L12.0):\nSec. A2. Each Federal department\nand agency which is empowered to extend\nFederal financial assistanceito- any pro-\ngram or activity, by way of grant, loan,\nor contract other than a contract of\ninsurance or guaranty, is authorized and\ndirected to effectuate the provisions of\nsection 301 with respect to such program\nor activity bv issuing rules, regulations,\nor orders of general applicability which\nshall be consistent with achievement of\nthe objectives of the statute authorizing\nthe financial assistance in connection\nwith which the action is tal7en. No such\nrule, regulation, or order shail become\neffective unless and until approved by\nthe President.\n-37\n\nAs can be seen from the text, this suhstitute combined\nthe first two sentences in the House version into one\nsentence. The meaning was changed in that the agencies\nwere now directed to issue rues and regulations to\neffectuate the substantive provisions of the Act, the\nrules and regulations issued were to be the frameworl\nwithin which all the administrative action was to be\nta.ften and the phrase \"consistent with the achievement\nof the objectives of the statute authorizing the\nfinancial assistance\" now modified the rules and regua-\ntions rather than, as it had in the House version, the\n\"action\" to be taken to effectuate the substantive pro-\nvisions of the Act. There was no change in the sentence\nregarding presidential approval.\nThis version of section 302 was passed by the\nSenate on June 19, 19G4, and finally signed into law\non July 2, 1964. Prior to its passage in the Senate,\nseveral amendments were introduced during the course of\ndebate relating to the requirement of presidential approval.\nSenator Thurmond proposed an amendment that would have\nrequired that Congress, rather than the President,\napprove the rules and regulations issued by each agency.\n110 Cong. Rec. 13937. Senator McClellan proposed an\namendment which would have postponed the effective date\nof the Title until six months after submission to Congress\nby the President of a report identifying all programs\ncovered by the Title and informing Congress of the rules\n-38-\n\nand regulations he had approved. 110 Cong. Rec. )145.\nAnd Senator Ervin proposed to eliminate agency action\nas the primary enforcement technique and to substitute\nsuits by the Attorney General based on sworn complaints.\nUnder his proposal the agencies would have been authorized\nto withhold assistance only after a judicial determina-\ntion in such a suit that there was a violation of 601\nand no rule-making power was given to the agency. 110\nCong. Rec. 12548. All these amendments were defeated\nin the Senate.\n(2) Purposes Underlying the Requirement of\nPresidential Approva.\nThe requirement of presidential approval was, we\nbelieve, primarily thought of as a safeguard against\narbitrary administrative action, and we in no way ignore\n12/\nthe importance of that safeguard.(cid:9) Accordingly,\nall exercises of the rule-making power contained in .Li302\nhave satisfied that requirement, and the regulation so\nissued has established the basic administrative frame-\nwork circumscribing the action of the Commissioner' of\nEducation. However, there is less of a need for such a\n12/ This congressional purpose seems to require the\nPresident himself to personally exercise his responsi-\nbility and authority to approve regulations issued under\nsection 502 and not to delegate this authority or\nresponsibility to the Secretary of the Department of\nHealth, Education and Welfare or to the Commissioner of\nEducation, even though such delegation is explicitly\nallowed by the terms of 3 U.S.C. .3301 (1)64 ed.). This\nstatutory power of the President to delegate his responsi-\nbility was not mentioned in the congressional debates on\nTitle VI, but we assume that the ove-Lriding purpose of\nCongress in adopting the presidential approval require-\nment in section 602 would preclude such a delegation under\n3 U.S.C. '301 (1964 ed.).\n- 39 -\n\nchedft against arbitrary action with respect to poicy\nstatements such as the guidelines.

The questj.on\nvas:\nHow is it intended that a consistent\nset of regulations prohibiting discrimina-\ntion in Federal financial assistance pro-\ngr.ams shall be estab.Lished throughout aU.\ndepartments and agencies? What procedure\nis provided by title VI to secure con-\nsistent regulations pursuant to, and the\nuniform application of, title VI in each\nand every Federal financial assistance\nprogram?\nThe Attorney General responded:\nSection d02 provides that each\nagency's rules and regulations must\nbe approved by the President. The\nvalidity of such rules and regula-\ntions will be subject to judicjal\nconsideration in any judicial revie'\nproceeding. Any cutoff of funds must\nbe reported to tie appropriate con-\ngressional committees.\nSee 110 Cong. Rec. 1399 (Senator Cooper's response).\nSimilarly, when Senator Thurmond's amendment to\nsubstitute the requirement of congressional approval\nfor that of presidential approval was defeated, Senator\nMiller read into the Record a letter from Deputy\nAttorney General Katzenhach, commenting on Senator\nMiller's suggestion that a phrase requiring uniformity\nin the rules and regulations be included in 3502. That\nletter said (11C Cong. Rec. 13D38):\nThis is in response to your re7uest\nfor comment on a suggestion that has been\nmade for amending the provision in section\n-41-\n\nX602 of H.R. 7152 which requires Presidentiai\napproval of the regulations to be issued\nby Federal agencies pursuant to that sec-\ntion. The suggestion is that language\nbe added directing the President to mal-e\ncertain that the regulations issued by the\nagencies not be inconsistent with each\nother.\nComplete uniformity in agency regula-\ntions is impossible because of the diversity\nin the programs and factual situations\ncovered by title VI, and in the statutes\nunder which those programs are adminis-\ntered. It is, of course, desirable that\nthe regulations be drafted so that there\nwill be no inconsistency in similar factual\nsituations involving similar statutory\nprovisions. Significant disparities in\ncommon procedures, or in the rules of\nagencies with similar programs, would be\nunjustified and, if they occurred, would\nundoubtedly lead to difficulties in the\nenforcement of title VI,\nThese considerations, as I under-\nstand it, were among the principal ones\nwhich motivated the House in writing and\nadopting the provisions for Presidential\napproval in section 302. It was intended\nthat once White House scrutiny and approval\nof agency rules was required, inconsis-\ntencies of the kind referred to would be\ndiscovered and eliminated.\nIn view of the foregoing, I do not\nbelieve that the suggested amendment is\nnecessary.\nWe believe that the congressional purpose 40\nto promote uniformity was satisfied in the promulgation\nof the regulation under r:302, which uas approved by the\nPresident. That regulation established an administra-\ntive framework in the Department of Health, Education\nand Welfare basically similar to those established  in\nall the other federal agencies with responsibility\n-42-\n\nunder Title VI.

Responsibility for administering this provision for most of the federal educational pro-\ngrams lies with the Office of Education of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Requests for federal\nsupport for these programs for the 1965-66 school year are note being prepared in thousands of communities in\nboth the North and the South. And in the process, the full import of the Civil Rights Act is becoming clear.\nThe South today is a society in agonizing transition. Ancient traditions and attitudes are slowly changing before\nthe onslaught of contemporary events. For a decade or more since the 1954 and 1955 Supreme Court decisions out-\nlawing segregation in the schools, the South has been moving with more deliberation than speed in bringing Negro\nand white together in the classroom. Slowly, but inexorably, however, efforts to avoid change have been swept\naway by the courts. The inevitability of full compliance with the Supreme Court's decision has become progres-\nsively clearer as one alternative after another has been attempted and has failed. Now Title VI opens another\nmajor act in the drama of school segregation. As one Florida news headline stated it, the issue for the seventeen\nSouthern states that receive more than $350 million annually for elementary and secondary school programs is:\n\"INTEGRATE—OR LOSE FEDERAL $$.\"\nThe issue appears clear—and, to the uninitiated, simple. Yet enforcement of Title VI is a complex matter. Its\npurpose is to build, not to destroy, to liberate, not to erect barriers. But harsh and unsympathetic enforcement\nof the letter of the law could be destructive. It could deny federal support to those children most desperately in need\nof it—and in the process exacerbate sectional feelings far beyond anything we have seen to date. Yet the law must\nbe enforced.\nAware of the complex responsibility assigned to it, the Office of Education has moved with its own version of\n\"all deliberate speed.\" To date it has been more notable for its caution than for its accomplishment in providing\nspecific direction to school authorities faced with the necessities of radical change under Title VI.\nThere are, to be sure, good reasons for caution. An official statement of well-defined standards for desegregation\nwould almost certainly he interpreted as an acceptable minimum, and fete if any school districts would feel obliged\nto move beyond them. Nor is it reasonable to expect equal action from communities in Mississippi or Alabama and\nthose in Kentucky or Tennessee. Yet it is difficult to justify unequal enforcement of the law. Meanwhile, Southern\nschool authorities are not receiving the guidance they need in charting their course in unfamiliar waters.\nThe following memo is designed to provide specific guidelines to school authorities seeking to meet the terms of\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Art. It was prepared by G. W. Faster, Jr., professor of law at the University of Wis-\nconsin and consultant to the Office of Education, who has- long been deeply concerned with the problems of education.\nMr. Foster's memo has no official status and does not bind the Office of Education in any fashion. Yet there is no\ndoubt that it reflects directly the thinking of the officials charged with the responsibility for enforcement of Title VI\nas it applies to education.\nSR hopes that Southern school authorities will find these guidelines helpful in making the fateful decisions that\nconfront them. And Northern readers will find, in the calm words and careful analysis of the memo, a clear\nview of the issues as they have evolved to (late.\nTHE ISSUE posed for Southern schools by Title VI of inapplicable to districts in the seventeen states which in 1954\n the 1964 Civil Rights Act is not whether they will de- maintained legally separated Negro and white schools since\n\t segregate.

On November 22, 1966, the United States \nintervened as plaintiff and amicus curiae and filed a complaint against the Governor of \nAlabama and the Governor's Commission, in which it sought a declaratory judgment that \nAct No. 252 is invalid under Article VI, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution, the \nsupremacy clause, because it interferes with the lawful federal enforcement of Title VI of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964.[2] The defendants, in their answer to the complaints and in a third-\nparty complaint against the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare and the United \nStates Commissioner of Education, asserted that the 1966 Guidelines, together with the \nHealth, Education and Welfare regulations[3] issued pursuant to Title VI, exceed the \nauthority conferred by Title VI and are repugnant to the Constitution. John W. Gardner, as \nSecretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and Harold Howe II, as \nCommissioner of Education, consented to being named as third-party defendants for the \npurpose of litigating those issues and filed full answers to the third-party complaint. \nThis action was heard on November 30, 1966, simultaneously with Lee v. Macon County \nBoard of Education, 267 F.Supp. 458 (M.D.Ala.) The parties called 16 witnesses, submitted \n40 depositions, and filed approximately 800 pages of briefs. February 3, 1967 was devoted \nto eight hours of oral argument. Broadly speaking, two issues are presented: \n(1) Is the Alabama Act No. 252 repugnant to the United States Constitution? \n(2) Are the 1966 Guidelines constitutionally valid and do they conform to the intent of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964? \nSubsequent developments in the law have reduced to a minimum the present necessity of \ncourt action on both issues. \nI. The Alabama Anti-guidelines Statute. \nIt is too clear for extended discussion that Act No. 252 of the 1966 Special Session of the \nAlabama Legislature has the effect of deterring and interfering with efforts of local school \nboards in Alabama to give and abide by assurances that they will administer federal \nassistance programs in compliance with section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, is in \nconflict with Title VI of that Act, and hence is unconstitutional and for that reason invalid \nunder the supremacy clause.[4] \nOur holding that Alabama Act No. 252 is invalid under the supremacy clause would be the \nsame even in the event of a judicial holding that the 1966 Guidelines are invalid. The reason \nis that we think that a State may not, except through court action reviewable by the \nSupreme Court of the United States, undertake to declare null and void any action of a \n\n \n \nfederal department or agency to implement or effectuate a federal statute. This is \nparticularly true where such declaration is a part of the State's effort to obstruct or interfere \nwith the operation of such statute. Such action by a State would be taking the law into its \nown hands and would inevitably conflict with the supremacy clause. \nIn Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, supra, without relying upon either the \nGuidelines or any action under the Alabama anti-guidelines statute, this district court has \nordered the 350*350 public schools and colleges in Alabama not already desegregated to be \ncompletely desegregated as of the beginning of the next school year. At this time it appears \nthat we can hopefully anticipate good faith compliance with that injunction and decree. \nThere is therefore no present necessity to issue an injunction or to do more than formally \ndeclare the invalidity of said Act No. 252. The court expressly reserves jurisdiction with \nrespect to said Act to issue such writs or take such action as may appear necessary or \nappropriate in the future. \nII. The 1966 Guidelines. \nAfter extensive briefing and full argument, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in United \nStates v. Jefferson County Board of Education, 372 F.2d 836, decided December 29, 1966, \nrehearing decided en banc March 29, 1967, 380 F.2d 385 has held that the 1966 HEW \nGuidelines are \"within the scope of the congressional and executive policies embodied in \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964.\" (372 F.2d p. 857.) Again the Court said: \"* * * we hold that \nHEW's standards are substantially the same as this Court's standards. They are required by \nthe Constitution and, as we construe them, are within the scope of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964.\" (p. 848.) On en banc rehearing, the Court reiterated: \"These Guidelines and our \ndecree are within the decisions of this Court, comply with the letter and spirit of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, and meet the requirements of the United States Constitution.\" (P. 390 of \n380 F.2d.) \nThese holdings were made deliberately and advisedly in the face of contentions that the \nvalidity of the 1966 Guidelines was not in issue. The Court ruled otherwise, holding that the \ncourts should rely heavily upon the Guidelines and should model their standards after those \npromulgated by the executive (372 F.2d p. 852), and that \"these Guidelines establish \nminimum standards clearly applicable to disestablishing state-sanctioned segregation.\" \n(Opinion on en banc rehearing p. 390 of 380 F.2d.) \nIt is the clear duty of this district court to follow the decision of our Court of Appeals. All of \nthe cases which have spoken on the subject so hold. \n\"The court of three judges is not a different court from the District Court, but is the District \nCourt composed of two additional judges sitting with the single District Judge before whom \nthe application for injunction has been made. 28 U.S.C. § 2284(1).\" \nJacobs v. Tawes, 4 Cir. 1957, 250 F.2d 611, 614. \n\n \n \n\"This [three-judge district] court's jurisdiction is that of a District Court and it is bound to \nfollow unreversed and unmodified decision by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the circuit.\" \nSunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, E.D.Ark.1940, 31 F.Supp. 125, 127, aff'd, 310 U.S. \n381, 60 S.Ct. 907, 84 L.Ed. 1263 (1940). \nIn Willis v. Pickrick Restaurant, N.D. Ga.1964, 231 F.Supp. 396, 400, it was said that the \njudgments of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit are binding on the three-judge district \ncourt. See also 1B Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 0.402, p. 62. \nEven if we were not bound by the decision of the Court of Appeals, the decision of that \nCourt en banc is entitled to such great deference and respect that we would be unwilling to \ndepart from it. For us to do so could result only in confusion. As in all cases, the parties in \nthe Fifth Circuit case and here have their appellate remedies. Upon the basis of the Fifth \nCircuit decision, as it now stands, we hold that the 1966 Guidelines are constitutionally valid \nand conform to the intent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \nIII. Ancillary Declarations and Observations. \nThe extensive development of the issues in this case, including many instances of actual \napplication of the Guidelines, does induce us to make a few ancillary declarations and \nobservations concerning the Guidelines. We hope that 351*351 these declarations may aid \nin the implementation of our decisions in Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, supra, \nand in the present case. \n1. The Guidelines, as their title indicates, are simply a statement of policies for school \ndesegregation plans by the Office of Education, U. S. Department of Health, Education and \nWelfare. They are not an exercise of rule-making power and hence do not have the \"status \nof law.\" Any department or agency action terminating or refusing to grant or to continue \nfinancial assistance is subject to plenary judicial review. In the absence of judicial review, \nthe school authorities may and should respect the Guidelines as a reliable guide to what the \nDepartment's enforcement action should be. \n2. As was recognized in Brown v. Board of Education, 1954, 347 U.S. 483, 493, 74 S.Ct. \n686, 691, 98 L.Ed. 873, 38 A.L.R.2d 1180: \"Today, education is perhaps the most important \nfunction of state and local governments.\" That function remains primarily the responsibility \nof state and local authorities and can be regulated by the Department of Health, Education \nand Welfare only to the extent appropriate to effectuate the provisions of section 601 of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964: \n\"Sec. 601. No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national \norigin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" \n\n \n \nThe objective of the statute, as clearly and succinctly stated in that section, is not \ncompulsory mixing of the races but freedom from discrimination. The statute does not \nrequire integration as an end in itself, nor is that required by the fourteenth amendment. Of \ncourse, some compulsory association of the races is necessary for the purpose of \ndesegregating the schools, but that is limited to such as is appropriate for eliminating a dual \nstructure of separate schools for students of different races and removing every vestige of \nlegal discrimination,[5] an expression which includes all state-imposed or state-sanctioned \ndiscrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin. The statutory requirement is \nbased upon the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws as enforced in Lee \nv. Macon County Board of Education, supra, where we held all state-sanctioned \nsegregation of the races in the public schools to be unconstitutional. The actual decision of \nthe Court of Appeals in United States v. Jefferson County Board of Education, supra, is to \nlike effect and does not call for any further or more complete mixing or balancing of the \nraces than may be appropriate for the purpose of correcting discrimination. As was held by \nthe en banc Court on rehearing: \n\"The percentages referred to in the Guidelines and in this Court's decree are simply a rough \nrule of thumb for measuring the effectiveness of freedom of choice as a useful tool. The \npercentages are not a method for setting quotas or striking a balance. If the plan is \nineffective, longer on promises than performance, the school officials charged with initiating \nand administering a unitary system have not met the constitutional requirements of the \nFourteenth Amendment; they should try other tools.\" \n3. The objective of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is to protect persons from discrimination on \naccount of their race, color, or national origin. The philosophy of the Act is to induce as \nmuch voluntary compliance as possible. No arbitrary power is vested in any federal \ndepartment or agency. The Act evinces a clear intention to limit the power of any federal \ndepartment or agency and to require its action to be pursuant to definite rules, regulations \nor guides of general applicability. The main purpose of that requirement is that 352*352 state \nand local authorities may be able to understand in advance of enforcement the rules, \nregulations and enforcement policies and, in the exercise of their primary functions and \nresponsibilities, to voluntarily conform their actions to rules of law. The purpose of the \nGuidelines is to \"provide assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply \nvoluntarily.\"[6] To fulfill that purpose it is essential that the Guidelines be explicit, certain, and \ndefinite. \n4. The provision in the Assurance of Compliance form HEW-441-13 beginning \"The \nApplicant also agrees that it will comply with any amendment of the Revised Statement * * \n*\" should be construed as referring to any valid and lawful amendment which conforms to \nthe intent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Any such assurance on the part of an applicant \nshall not be construed as requiring more than the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires nor so as \nto preclude or prejudice the applicant in any judicial review involving any such amendment \nor any other provision of the Guidelines. \n\n \n \n5. A Regulation of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare approved by the \nPresident on December 3, 1964, and which therefore has the force and effect of law, 45 \nC.F.R. 80.4(c), requires that with respect to elementary or secondary school systems, \n\"assurances of compliance\" as prerequisites to obtaining federal financial assistance \"shall \nbe deemed to be satisfied\" if such school system is subject to a final order of a court of the \nUnited States for the desegregation of such school system and gives assurance that it will \ncomply with such order. As courts attempt to cooperate with executive and legislative \npolicies, so too the Department must respect a court order for the desegregation of a school \nor school system. \nThe court retains jurisdiction of each of the parties and their successors in office and of this \ncase for such further proceedings, orders and decrees as may hereafter appear \nappropriate. \n[1] Act No. 252 declares that the Revised Statement of Policies for School Desegregation Plans under Title VI of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, better known as the \"1966 Guidelines,\" issued by the United States Commissioner of \nEducation in March, 1966, exceeds the authority granted by the Civil Rights Act, is unconstitutional, and interferes \nwith the public duties of school officials in the State of Alabama. It provides that any assurance of compliance by local \nboards with the Guidelines is null and void, and that local boards have no authority to give any assurance of \ncompliance. It further provides in certain contingencies that the State shall make up or replace any loss to a local \nboard to which federal assistance is denied or deferred.

Sess., p. 372.\n\nagainst its implementation. The complaint rests upon the due\nprocess and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment\nand the impairment of contract clause of Article I, Section 10\nof the United States Constitution. On November 22, 1966, the\nUnited States intervened as plaintiff and amicus curiae and\nfiled a complaint against the Governor of Alabama and the\nGovernor's Commission, in which it sought a declaratory judgment\nthat Act No. 252 is invalid under Article VI, Clause 2 of the\nUnited States Constitution, the supremacy clause, because it\n. interferes with the lawful federal enforcement of Title VI of\nV\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964.(cid:9) The defendants, in their answer\nto the complaints and in a third-party complaint against the\nSecretary of Health, Education and Welfare and the United States\nCommissioner of Education, asserted that the 1966 Guidelines,\ntogether with the Health, Education and Welfare regulations\nissued pursuant to Title VI, exceed the authority conferred by\nTitle VI and are repugnant to the Constitution. John W. Gardner,\nas Secretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare,\nand Harold Howe II, as Commissioner of Education, consented to\nbeing named as third-party defendants for the purpose of\nlitigating those issues and filed full answers to the third-\nparty complaint.\nThis action was heard on November 30, 1966,\nsimultaneously with Lee v. Macon Count Board of Education,\n2/(cid:9) Pub. L. 88-352, Tit. VI, §§601-605, July 2, 1964, 78 Stat.\n252, 253, 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 2000d--2000d-4.\n_V(cid:9) 45 C.F.R. 80.\n-2-\n\nC.A. No. 604-E (M.D. Ala.). The parties called 16 witnesses,\nsubmitted 40 depositions, and filed approximately 800 pages of\nbriefs. February 3, 1967 was devoted to eight hours of oral\nargument. Broadly speaking, two issues are presented:\n(1) Is the Alabama Act No. 252 repugnant to\nthe United States Constitution?\n(2) Are the 1966 Guidelines constitutionally\n. valid and do they conform to the intent\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964?\nSubsequent developments in the law have reduced to\na minimum the present necessity of court action  on both issues.\n.I. The Alabama Anti-quidelines Statute.\nIt is too clear for extended discussion that Act\nNo. 252 of the 1966 Special Session of the Alabama Legislature\nhas the effect of deterring and interfering with efforts of\nlocal school, boards in Alabama to give and abide by assurances\nthat they will administer federal assistance programs in\ncompliance with section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\nis in conflict with Title VI of that Act, and hence is\nunconstitutional and for that reason invalid under the supremacy\n±t/\nclause.(cid:9) •\nOur holding that Alabama Act No. 252 is invalid under\nthe supremacy clause would be the same even in the event of a\njudicial holding that the 1966 Guidelines are invalid. The\n4/ See United States v. Allegheny County, 1944, 322 U.S. 174,\n183; United States v. Georgia Public Service Commission, 1963,\n371 U.S. 285, 293.\n-3-\n\nreason is that we think that a State may not, except through\ncourt action reviewable by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates, undertake to declare null and void any action of a\nfederal department or agency to implement or effectuate a\nfederal statute. This is particularly true where such declaration\nis a part of the State's effort to obstruct or interfere with\nthe operation of such statute. Such action by a State would be\ntaking the law into its own hands and would inevitably conflict\nwith the supremacy clause.\n'In Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, supra,\nwithout relying upon either the Guidelines or any action under\nthe Alabama anti-guidelines statute, this district court has\nordered the public schools and colleges in Alabama not already\ndesegregated to be completely desegregated as of the beginning\nof the next school year. At this time it appears that we can\nhopefully anticipate good faith compliance with that injunction\nand decree. There is therefore no present necessity to issue\nan injunction or to do more than formally declare the invalidity\nof said Act No. 252. The court expressly reserves jurisdiction\nwith respect to said Act to issue such writs or take such\naction as 'may appear necessary or appropriate in the future.\nII. The  1966 Guidelines.\nAfter extensive briefing and full argument, the Court\nof Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in No. 23,345, United States \nv. Jefferson County Board of Education, decided December 29,\n1966, rehearing decided en bane March 29, 1967, has held that\nthe 1966 HEW Guidelines are \"within the scope of the\n-4-\n\ncongressional and executive policies embodied in the Civil\nRights Act of 1964.\" (Slip opinion p. 29.) Again the Court\nsaid: \" * * * we hold that HEW's standards are substantially\nthe same as this Court's standards. They are required by the\nConstitution and, as we construe them, are within the scope\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\" (Slip opinion p. 9.) On\nen banc rehearing, the Court reiterated: \"These Guidelines\nand our decree are within the decisions of this Court, comply\nwith the letter and spirit of the Civil Rights Act of 1964;\nand meet the requirements of the . United States Constitution.\"\n.(Slip opinion p. 7.)\nThese holdings were made deliberately and advisedly\nin the face of contentions that the validity of the 1966\nGuidelines was not in issue. The Court ruled otherwise,\nholding that the courts should rely heavily upon the Guidelines\nand should model their standards after those promulgated by\nthe executive (original slip opinion p. 18), and that \"these.\nGuidelines establish minimum standards clearly applicable to\ndisestablishing state-sanctioned segregation.\" (Slip opinion\non en banc rehearing' p. 7.)\nIt is the clear duty of this district court to follow\nthe decision of our Court of Appeals. All of the cases which\nhave spoken on the subject so hold.\n\"The court of three judges is not a different court\nfrom the District Court, but is the District Court\ncomposed of two additional judges sitting with the\nsingle District Judge before whom the application for\ninjunction has been made. 28 U.S.C. §2284(1).\"\nJacobs v. Tawes 14 Cir. 1957, 250 F.2d 611, 614.\n-5-\n\n\"This [three-judge district) court's jurisdiction\nis that of a District Court and it is bound to follow\nunreversed and unmodified decision by the Circuit Court\nof Appeals of the circuit.\"\nSunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, E.D. Ark. 1940,\n31 F. Supp. 125, 127, aff'd, 310 U.S. 381 (1940).\nIn Willis v. Pickwick Restaurant, N.D. Ga. 1964,\n231 F. Supp. 396, 400, it was said that the judgments of the\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit are binding on the\nthree-judge district court. See also lB Moore's Federal\nPractice 50.402, p. 62.\nEven if we were not bound by the decision of the.\nCourt of Appeals, the decision of that Court en banc is entitled\nto such'great deference and respect that we would be unwilling\nto depart from it. For us to do so could result only in\nconfusion. As in all cases, the parties in the Fifth Circuit\ncase and here have their appellate remedies. Upon the basis\nof the Fifth Circuit decision, as it now stands, we hold that\nthe 1966 Guidelines are constitutionally valid and conform to\nthe intent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nIII. Ancillar Declarations and Observations.\nThe extensive development of the issues in this case,\nincluding many instances of actual application of the Guidelines,\ndoes induce us to make a few ancillary declarations and\nobservations concerning the Guidelines. We hope that these\ndeclarations may aid in the implementation of our decisions\n=E , \nin Lee v. Macon County Board of Education,  and in the\npresent case.\n-6-\n\n1. The Guidelines, as their title indicates, are\nsimply a statement of policies for school desegregation plans\nby the Office of Education, U.S. Department of Health, Education\nand Welfare. They are not an exercise of rule-making power and\nhence do not have the \"status of law.\" Any department or agency\naction terminating or refusing to grant or to continue financial\nassistance is subject to plenary judicial review. In the absence\nof judicial review, the school authorities may and should respect\nthe Guidelines as a reliable guide to what the Department's\nenforcement action should be.\n2. As was recognized in Brown v. Board of Education,\n1954, 347 U.S. 483, 493: \"Today, education is perhaps the most\nimportant function of state and local governments.\" That\nfunction remains primarily the responsibility of state and local\nauthorities and can be regulated by the Department of Health,\nEducation and Welfare only to the extent appropriate to\neffectuate the provisions of section 601 of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964:\n\"Sec. 601. No person in the United States shall,\non the ground of race, color, or national origin, be\nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits\nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program\nor activity.'receiving Federal financial assistance.\"\nThe objective of the statute, as clearly and succinctly stated\nin that section, is not compulsory mixing of the races but\nfreedom from discrimination. The statute does not require\nintegration as an end in itself, nor is that required by the\nfourteenth amendment. Of course, some compulsory association\nof the races is necessary for the purpose of desegregating\nthe schools, but that is limited to such as is appropriate for\n-7-\nI\n\neliminating a dual st:-:ucture of separate schools for students\nof different races and removing every vestige of legal\ndiscrimination, an expression which includes all state-imposed\nor state-sanctioned discrimination on the ground of race, color,\nor national origin. The statutory requirement is based upon the\nconstitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws as\nenforced in Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, .212(cid:9) where\nwe held all state-sanctioned segregation of the races in the\npublic schools to be unconstitutional. The actual decision of\nthe Court of Appeals in United States v. Jefferson County Board\nof Education, supra, is to like effect and does not call for any\nfurther or more complete mixing or balancing of the races than\nmay be appropriate for the purpose of correcting discrimination.\nAs was held by the en Banc Court on rehearing:\n\"The percentages referred to in the Guidelines\nand in this Court's decree are simply a rough rule\nof thumb for measuring the effectiveness of freedom\nof choice as a useful tool. The percentages are not\na method for setting quotas or striking a balance.\nIf the plan is ineffective, longer on promises than\nperformance, the school officials charged with\ninitiating and administering a unitary system have\nnot met the constitutional requirements of the\nFourteenth Amendment; they should try other tools.\"\n3. The objective of the Ciyil Rights Act of 1964 is\nto protect persons from discrimination on account of their race,\ncolor, or national origin. The philosophy of the Act is to\ninduce as much voluntary compliance as possible. No arbitrary\npower is vested in any federal department or agency. The Act\nevinces a clear intention to limit the power of any federal\ndepartment or agency and to require its action to be pursuant\n'to definite rules, regulations or guides of general applicability.\n-5/(cid:9) See Brown v. Board of Education, 1954, 347 U.S. 483, 491.\n-8-\n\nThe main purpose of that requirement is that state and local\nauthorities may be able to understand in advance of enforcement\nthe rules, regulations and enforcement policies and, in the\nexercise of their primary functions and responsibilities, to\nvoluntarily conform their actions to rules of law. The purpose\nof the Guidelines is to \"provide assistance and guidance to\nrecipients to help them comply voluntarily.\" To fulfill that\npurpose it is essential that the Guidelines be explicit, certain,\nand definite.\n4. The provision in the Assurance of Compliance form\nHEW-441-13 beginning \"The Applicant also agrees that it will\ncomply with any amendment of the Revised Statement * * * \"\nshould be construed as referring to any valid and lawful\namendment which conforms to the intent of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964. Any such assurance on the part of an applicant shall\nnot be construed as requiring more than the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964 requires nor so as to preclude or prejudice the applicant\nin any judicial review involving any such amendment or any other\nprovision of the Guidelines.\n5. . A Regulation of the Department of Health, Education\nand Welfare approved by the President on December 3, 1964, and\nwhich therefore has the force and effect of law, 45 C.F.R.\n80.4(c), requires that with respect to elementary or secondary\nschool systems, \"assurances of compliance\" as prerequisites\nto obtaining federal financial assistance \"shall be deemed to\nbe satisfied\" if such school system is subject to a final order\nEl(cid:9) 45 C.F.R. 80.6(a).\n-9-\n\n, of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such\nschool system and gives assurance that it will comply with\nsuch order..

Macon Count Board of Education,\n2/(cid:9) Pub. L. 88-352, Tit. VI, §§601-605, July 2, 1964, 78 Stat.\n252, 253, 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 2000d--2000d-4.\n_V(cid:9) 45 C.F.R. 80.\n-2-\n\nC.A. No. 604-E (M.D. Ala.). The parties called 16 witnesses,\nsubmitted 40 depositions, and filed approximately 800 pages of\nbriefs. February 3, 1967 was devoted to eight hours of oral\nargument. Broadly speaking, two issues are presented:\n(1) Is the Alabama Act No. 252 repugnant to\nthe United States Constitution?\n(2) Are the 1966 Guidelines constitutionally\n. valid and do they conform to the intent\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964?\nSubsequent developments in the law have reduced to\na minimum the present necessity of court action  on both issues.\n.I. The Alabama Anti-quidelines Statute.\nIt is too clear for extended discussion that Act\nNo. 252 of the 1966 Special Session of the Alabama Legislature\nhas the effect of deterring and interfering with efforts of\nlocal school, boards in Alabama to give and abide by assurances\nthat they will administer federal assistance programs in\ncompliance with section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\nis in conflict with Title VI of that Act, and hence is\nunconstitutional and for that reason invalid under the supremacy\n±t/\nclause.(cid:9) •\nOur holding that Alabama Act No. 252 is invalid under\nthe supremacy clause would be the same even in the event of a\njudicial holding that the 1966 Guidelines are invalid. The\n4/ See United States v. Allegheny County, 1944, 322 U.S. 174,\n183; United States v. Georgia Public Service Commission, 1963,\n371 U.S. 285, 293.\n-3-\n\nreason is that we think that a State may not, except through\ncourt action reviewable by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates, undertake to declare null and void any action of a\nfederal department or agency to implement or effectuate a\nfederal statute. This is particularly true where such declaration\nis a part of the State's effort to obstruct or interfere with\nthe operation of such statute. Such action by a State would be\ntaking the law into its own hands and would inevitably conflict\nwith the supremacy clause.\n'In Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, supra,\nwithout relying upon either the Guidelines or any action under\nthe Alabama anti-guidelines statute, this district court has\nordered the public schools and colleges in Alabama not already\ndesegregated to be completely desegregated as of the beginning\nof the next school year. At this time it appears that we can\nhopefully anticipate good faith compliance with that injunction\nand decree. There is therefore no present necessity to issue\nan injunction or to do more than formally declare the invalidity\nof said Act No. 252. The court expressly reserves jurisdiction\nwith respect to said Act to issue such writs or take such\naction as 'may appear necessary or appropriate in the future.\nII. The  1966 Guidelines.\nAfter extensive briefing and full argument, the Court\nof Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in No. 23,345, United States \nv. Jefferson County Board of Education, decided December 29,\n1966, rehearing decided en bane March 29, 1967, has held that\nthe 1966 HEW Guidelines are \"within the scope of the\n-4-\n\ncongressional and executive policies embodied in the Civil\nRights Act of 1964.\" (Slip opinion p. 29.) Again the Court\nsaid: \" * * * we hold that HEW's standards are substantially\nthe same as this Court's standards. They are required by the\nConstitution and, as we construe them, are within the scope\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\" (Slip opinion p. 9.) On\nen banc rehearing, the Court reiterated: \"These Guidelines\nand our decree are within the decisions of this Court, comply\nwith the letter and spirit of the Civil Rights Act of 1964;\nand meet the requirements of the . United States Constitution.\"\n.(Slip opinion p. 7.)\nThese holdings were made deliberately and advisedly\nin the face of contentions that the validity of the 1966\nGuidelines was not in issue. The Court ruled otherwise,\nholding that the courts should rely heavily upon the Guidelines\nand should model their standards after those promulgated by\nthe executive (original slip opinion p. 18), and that \"these.\nGuidelines establish minimum standards clearly applicable to\ndisestablishing state-sanctioned segregation.\" (Slip opinion\non en banc rehearing' p. 7.)\nIt is the clear duty of this district court to follow\nthe decision of our Court of Appeals. All of the cases which\nhave spoken on the subject so hold.\n\"The court of three judges is not a different court\nfrom the District Court, but is the District Court\ncomposed of two additional judges sitting with the\nsingle District Judge before whom the application for\ninjunction has been made. 28 U.S.C. §2284(1).\"\nJacobs v. Tawes 14 Cir. 1957, 250 F.2d 611, 614.\n-5-\n\n\"This [three-judge district) court's jurisdiction\nis that of a District Court and it is bound to follow\nunreversed and unmodified decision by the Circuit Court\nof Appeals of the circuit.\"\nSunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, E.D. Ark. 1940,\n31 F. Supp. 125, 127, aff'd, 310 U.S. 381 (1940).\nIn Willis v. Pickwick Restaurant, N.D. Ga. 1964,\n231 F. Supp. 396, 400, it was said that the judgments of the\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit are binding on the\nthree-judge district court. See also lB Moore's Federal\nPractice 50.402, p. 62.\nEven if we were not bound by the decision of the.\nCourt of Appeals, the decision of that Court en banc is entitled\nto such'great deference and respect that we would be unwilling\nto depart from it. For us to do so could result only in\nconfusion. As in all cases, the parties in the Fifth Circuit\ncase and here have their appellate remedies. Upon the basis\nof the Fifth Circuit decision, as it now stands, we hold that\nthe 1966 Guidelines are constitutionally valid and conform to\nthe intent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nIII. Ancillar Declarations and Observations.\nThe extensive development of the issues in this case,\nincluding many instances of actual application of the Guidelines,\ndoes induce us to make a few ancillary declarations and\nobservations concerning the Guidelines. We hope that these\ndeclarations may aid in the implementation of our decisions\n=E , \nin Lee v. Macon County Board of Education,  and in the\npresent case.\n-6-\n\n1. The Guidelines, as their title indicates, are\nsimply a statement of policies for school desegregation plans\nby the Office of Education, U.S. Department of Health, Education\nand Welfare. They are not an exercise of rule-making power and\nhence do not have the \"status of law.\" Any department or agency\naction terminating or refusing to grant or to continue financial\nassistance is subject to plenary judicial review. In the absence\nof judicial review, the school authorities may and should respect\nthe Guidelines as a reliable guide to what the Department's\nenforcement action should be.\n2. As was recognized in Brown v. Board of Education,\n1954, 347 U.S. 483, 493: \"Today, education is perhaps the most\nimportant function of state and local governments.\" That\nfunction remains primarily the responsibility of state and local\nauthorities and can be regulated by the Department of Health,\nEducation and Welfare only to the extent appropriate to\neffectuate the provisions of section 601 of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964:\n\"Sec. 601. No person in the United States shall,\non the ground of race, color, or national origin, be\nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits\nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program\nor activity.'receiving Federal financial assistance.\"\nThe objective of the statute, as clearly and succinctly stated\nin that section, is not compulsory mixing of the races but\nfreedom from discrimination. The statute does not require\nintegration as an end in itself, nor is that required by the\nfourteenth amendment. Of course, some compulsory association\nof the races is necessary for the purpose of desegregating\nthe schools, but that is limited to such as is appropriate for\n-7-\nI\n\neliminating a dual st:-:ucture of separate schools for students\nof different races and removing every vestige of legal\ndiscrimination, an expression which includes all state-imposed\nor state-sanctioned discrimination on the ground of race, color,\nor national origin. The statutory requirement is based upon the\nconstitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws as\nenforced in Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, .212(cid:9) where\nwe held all state-sanctioned segregation of the races in the\npublic schools to be unconstitutional. The actual decision of\nthe Court of Appeals in United States v. Jefferson County Board\nof Education, supra, is to like effect and does not call for any\nfurther or more complete mixing or balancing of the races than\nmay be appropriate for the purpose of correcting discrimination.\nAs was held by the en Banc Court on rehearing:\n\"The percentages referred to in the Guidelines\nand in this Court's decree are simply a rough rule\nof thumb for measuring the effectiveness of freedom\nof choice as a useful tool. The percentages are not\na method for setting quotas or striking a balance.\nIf the plan is ineffective, longer on promises than\nperformance, the school officials charged with\ninitiating and administering a unitary system have\nnot met the constitutional requirements of the\nFourteenth Amendment; they should try other tools.\"\n3. The objective of the Ciyil Rights Act of 1964 is\nto protect persons from discrimination on account of their race,\ncolor, or national origin. The philosophy of the Act is to\ninduce as much voluntary compliance as possible. No arbitrary\npower is vested in any federal department or agency. The Act\nevinces a clear intention to limit the power of any federal\ndepartment or agency and to require its action to be pursuant\n'to definite rules, regulations or guides of general applicability.\n-5/(cid:9) See Brown v. Board of Education, 1954, 347 U.S. 483, 491.\n-8-\n\nThe main purpose of that requirement is that state and local\nauthorities may be able to understand in advance of enforcement\nthe rules, regulations and enforcement policies and, in the\nexercise of their primary functions and responsibilities, to\nvoluntarily conform their actions to rules of law. The purpose\nof the Guidelines is to \"provide assistance and guidance to\nrecipients to help them comply voluntarily.\" To fulfill that\npurpose it is essential that the Guidelines be explicit, certain,\nand definite.\n4. The provision in the Assurance of Compliance form\nHEW-441-13 beginning \"The Applicant also agrees that it will\ncomply with any amendment of the Revised Statement * * * \"\nshould be construed as referring to any valid and lawful\namendment which conforms to the intent of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964. Any such assurance on the part of an applicant shall\nnot be construed as requiring more than the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964 requires nor so as to preclude or prejudice the applicant\nin any judicial review involving any such amendment or any other\nprovision of the Guidelines.\n5. . A Regulation of the Department of Health, Education\nand Welfare approved by the President on December 3, 1964, and\nwhich therefore has the force and effect of law, 45 C.F.R.\n80.4(c), requires that with respect to elementary or secondary\nschool systems, \"assurances of compliance\" as prerequisites\nto obtaining federal financial assistance \"shall be deemed to\nbe satisfied\" if such school system is subject to a final order\nEl(cid:9) 45 C.F.R. 80.6(a).\n-9-\n\n, of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such\nschool system and gives assurance that it will comply with\nsuch order.. As courts attempt to cooperate with executive and\nlegislative policies, so too the Department must respect a\ncourt order for the desegregation of a school or school system.\nThe court retains jurisdiction of each of the parties\nand their successors in office and of this case for such further\nproceedings, orders and decrees as may hereafter appear\nappropriate.\nDone this the 3rd day of May, 1967.\nUnited States Circuit Judge.\noc,/\nUnited StateL.
