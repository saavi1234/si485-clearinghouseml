Therefore, we are not sufficiently apprised\nof all of the factual considerations which may prove deter-\nminative of at least some questions raised by this appeal.\nNevertheless, this case raises questions of first impres-\nsion in the appellate courts concerning the scope of school\ndesegregation duties and remedies, and related questions of\nlaw and policy which have not directly been raised in previ-\nous cases arising under Brown v. Board of Education, 347\nU.S. 483 (1954) and 349 U.S. 294 (1955). It is these novel\naspects that we discuss in this memorandum in an attempt to\noutline, in broad form, some legal and policy considerations\nwhich we think may assist this Court in deciding the instant\nappeal.\nThis is not primarily a case about segregation re-\nquired by state law, because state law has never required\nsegregation as between Richmond and the neighboring school\nsystems. The issue, instead, is whether the maintenance of\nthe separate school divisions constitutes racial discrimina-\ntion. The history of the state-imposed official policy of\nsegregation within school subdivisions is only an element\nof the proof relating to the maintenance of the division\n- 2 -\n\nlines. Aside from that history, the issue in this case\nappears, in large measure, to be whether school authorities\nhave the affirmative duty to overcome the racial impaction\nbetween separate school divisions resulting from resi-\ndential segregation caused, in part, by public and private\ndiscrimination. Aspects of that issue are now under con-\nsideration by the Congress of the United States (proposed\nI/\nEqual Educational Opportunities Act of 1972) and by the\nSupreme Court of the United States. (Keyes v. School Dis-\ntrict No. 1, O.T. 1971 No. 71-507). We therefore think this\nCourt should consider whether deferral of a decision would\nbe appropriate pending action by Congress (cf. Baker v.\nCarr's reference to \"the impossibility of deciding without\nan initial policy determination of a kind clearly for non-\njudicial discretion\", 369 U.S. 186, 217 ) or by the Supreme\nCourt (see the attached letter from the clerk of the Fifth\nCircuit Court of Appeals relating to Cisneros v. Corpus\nj/ See, e.g., Sec. 404 of H.R. 13915:\nIn the formulation of remedies under\nsection 401 or 402 of this Act, the lines\ndrawn by a State, subdividing its terri-\ntory into separate school districts, shall\nnot be ignored or altered except where it\nis established that the lines were drawn\nfor the purpose, and had the effect, of\nsegregating children among public schools\non the basis of race, color, or national\norigin.\n- 3 -\n\nChristi). The following discussion not only bears on the\nmerits of the case, but also on the question whether the\nissues presented are of such a nature that deferral would\nbe appropriate.\nI. The Constitutional Violation\nFederal courts have found discriminatory, and en-\njoined where appropriate, the creation of separate school\ndistricts in formerly dual systems where the purpose and\neffect of the creation was to impede desegregation; e.g.,\nLee v. Macon County Board of Education, 448 F. 2d 746 (5th\nCir., 1971); Burleson v. County Board of Election Commis-\nsioners, 308 F. Supp. 352 (E.D. Ark., 1970), aff'd 432 F.\n2d 1356 (8th Cir., 1970); cf. Wright v. Council of the City\nof Emporia, 442 F. 2d 570 (4th Cir., 1971), cert. granted,\nNo. 70-130 (0.T. 1971), and companion cases. Federal courts\nhave also enjoined the maintenance of rural black school dis-\ntricts which were created as instruments of dualism, and\nordered consolidation of these with neighboring white dis-\ntricts; e.g., Haney v. County Board of Education of Sevier\nCounty, 429 F. 2d 364 (8th Cir., 1970); United States v.\nTexas, 321 F. Supp. 1043 (E.D. Texas 1970), aff'd 447 F.\n2d 441 (5th Cir., 1971), cert. denied,(cid:9) U.S.(cid:9) (1971).\n- 4 -\n\nWhile these and other cases hold that a state's power\nto establish and maintain particular governmental subdivision\nlines is subject to the equal protection clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment, Cf., Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S.\n339 (1960), they do not dispose of the question raised in\nthis case. Here the constitutional attack is directed\nsolely to the maintenance of longstanding political sub-\ndivision lines -- lines drawn before Brown which, at the\ndate of Brown, divided the area covered by the three school\nsystems in question into majority white segments of a rela-\n2/\ntively minor racial variation.\nThe Equal Protection Clause does not require a parti-\ncular racial balance in schools in a single school district,\neven if formerly dual, Swann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S.\n1, 22-25 (1971), nor does it require racial balance between\nseparate school districts in a single state, Spencer v.\nKugler, 326 F. Supp. 1235 (D. N.J. 1971), aff'd(cid:9) U.S.\n(1972). In fact, Spencer stands for the proposition that, at\nleast in states not recently operating dual school systems,\nextreme racial imbalance, without more, does not require\n2/ Richmond's school system was 43.5% black in 1954-55,\nand Chesterfield's 20.47 black and Henrico's 10.4% black in\n1953-54.\n- 5 -\n\nthe reformation of neutrally established school district\nboundary lines. See 326 F. Supp. at 1243.\nThe question then becomes whether the maintenance\nto the present day of these neutrally established school\ndivision lines in the Richmond metropolitan area is\nracially discriminatory. This, in turn, requires an\nexamination of the correctness of the district court's\nmethod of analysis of inter-system discrimination. On\nbalance, the district court appears to have applied to\nschool systems collectively the concepts of racial dis-\ncrimination heretofore applied to individual schools in\none school system, apparently basing its decision on the\nfact that the Fourteenth Amendment speaks only to the\nstates. It is true that numerous cases have recognized\nthat state as well as local school authorities have affir-\nmative obligations to take steps to eradicate the discrimi-\nnation inherent in dual school systems. See, e.g., Cooper\nM\nv. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 16-17 (1958); Griffin v. County\nSchool Board, 377 U.S. 218 (1964); Lee v. Macon County\nBoard of Education, 267 F. Supp. 458 (M.D. Ala., 1967),\naff'd sub nom Wallace v. United States, 389 U.S. 215 (1967);\n- 6 -\n\nA\nUnited States v. Texas, 321 F. Supp. 1043 (E.D. Tex., 1970),\n330 F. Supp. 235 (E.D. Tex., 1971); modified and affirmed,\n447 F. 2d 441. (5th Cir., 1971); stay denied, 404 U.S. 1206,\ncert. denied,(cid:9) U.S.(cid:9) (1972); cf. North Carolina Board\n3'\nof Education v. Swann, 402 U.S. 43 (1971).\nHowever, the district court appears not to have\nacknowledged that this application involves, in the circum-\nstances of this case, a definite extension of legal prin-\nciples beyond existing court decisions. The logical under-\npinnings of the law and the ramifications of such a major\nextension should be fully explored by this Court. These\nlegal concepts and the propriety of their application to\nseveral school systems at once in a major metropolitan\narea are discussed below.\n3/ \nThe defendants in this case include an agency of the\nstate of Virginia with state-wide powers (the State Board\nof Education) as well as subsidiary officials of the state\ngovernment with only local powers (the Boards of Education\nand Boards of Supervisors of Henrico and Chesterfield\nCounties).\n- 7 -\n\n(a) Racial Identifiability\nThis concept has traditionally been used in school\ndesegregation cases in assessing whether the effects of state-\nimposed dualism have been eradicated at a particular school.\nThus, school authorities have been charged with the duty to\n\"convert promptly to a system without a 'white' school and\na 'Negro' school, but just schools.\" Green v. County School\nBoard, 391 U.S. 430, 442 (1968). The heart of this concept\nis the notion that a particular school is designated by the\nstate for students of one race, with a concomitant community\nperception that schools designated for black students are in-\nferior. The Court in Brown expressed the same notion (albeit\nexpressed in terms of students rather than schools) when it\nsaid:\nWe come then to the question presented:\nDoes segregation of children in public\nschools solely on the basis of race,\neven though the physical facilities and\nother 'tangible' factors may be equal,\ndeprive the children of the minority\ngroup of equal educational opportunities?\nWe believe that it does. 347 U.S. 483\nat 493.\nThe district court concluded that the school systems\nhere were racially identifiable, vis-a-vis each other, on the\nbasis of statistical evidence, expert testimony and evidence\nof state action which had the effect of limiting black resi-\ndence to the area circumscribed by the boundaries of Richmond.\n- 8 -\n\nCourts have often used statistical evidence in assessing\nracial identifiability of particular schools, but this\nassessment has been vis-a-vis schools within a dual system,\nand in the context of deciding whether dualism had been\neradicated. Cf. Swann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 26\n(1971). Courts have not often focused on expert testimony\nin determining the existence of racial identifiability, and\nit would appear that this Court should examine the district\n4/\ncourt's findings relating to the expert testimony,(cid:9) to\ndetermine whether they add anything to the statistics, so\nas to support the conclusion of the district court that in\nthe Richmond area, in the facts of this case, these school\nsystems are racially identifiable. In assessing the correct-\nness of the district court's conclusion about the imbalance,\nthis Court must decide what significance should be attached\nto the fact that each of the three school systems has hereto-\nfore become unitary as required by law. This means that the\nracial identifiability of the schools within the system has,\nto the extent feasible, been erased if one looks at each\n4 / See, for example, the discussion of Dr. Pettigrew's\ntestimony, pp. 249-254 of the district court's opinion of\nJanuary 5, 1972. It seems clear that Dr. Pettigrew objects\nto schools over 40% black (in areas where the school popula-\ntion is under 40% black) regardless of whether the condition\nstemmed from state action. But the concept of racial identi-\nfiability includes in it, as an essential ingredient, the\nelement of state action.\n- 9 -\n\nsystem separately. The Court should also decide whether it\nwas proper to compare the three unitary school systems with\neach other, or whether the inquiry should have been limited\nto whether state action contributed to racial identifiability\nof particular schools as among the three divisions. For\nexample, if the state had built a high school on the Richmond\nborder to serve black children from Richmond and Henrico\nCounty and that school is 78% black today it might be per-\nceived as racially identifiable if located 1.4 miles from a\n967 white high school in Henrico County built for white stu-\n5 /\ndents from both systems,(cid:9) but the same result does not follow\nin comparing a 90% white school in southern Chesterfield County\nwith a 70% black school 20 miles away in Richmond.\n(b) Discrimination by public and private agencies\nother than school authorities.\nThis Court has previously said that school authorities\nmay not superimpose individual school zone lines upon racially\nsegregated housing patterns enforced by state or private dis-\ncrimination. Brewer v. School Board, 397 F.2d 37 (4th Ciro\n1968). See also, Davis v. School District, 309 F. Supp. 734,\n742 (E.D. Mich. 1970); aff'd 443 F.2d 573 (6th Cir. 1971);\ncert. denied, 404 U.S. 913 (1971). The district court\n5/ Cf. January 5 Memorandum Opinion, p. 242.\n- 10 -\n\napplied this principle to the three school systems covering\nthe Richmond metropolitan area, finding that blacks had been,\nthrough various discriminatory practices, segregated and\nconfined in the Richmond City system. No other court has,\nprior to the decision below, based interdistrict school relief\non such a finding. But see, Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing\nAuthority, 448 F.2d 731 (7th Cir. 1971). Regardless of whether\nthe Brewer doctrine should be extended beyond school division\nlines, there is the further question whether the specific\nevidence cited by the district court supports its ultimate\nfindings that political subdivision lines in fact follow the\n6/\nracial residential lines(cid:9) and that the segregation was a\nresult of public and private discrimination. Residential\nracial segregation has many causes, of which racial discrimina-\ntion is one.\nBeyond this, Swann teaches that when school districts\nachieve unitariness, district courts should not be required\nto intervene further absent a showing that \"either the\nschool authorities or some other agency of the State has\ndeliberately attempted to fix or alter demographic patterns\n6/ There are approximately 13,500 white students in Richmond\nand 5184 black students in the two counties in 1971-72.\n- 11 -\n\nto affect the racial composition of the schools.\" 402 U.S.\nat 32. It would appear, reasoning from this, that dis-\ntrict courts should not require interdistrict relief,\nwhere there is no question of changes or alterations in\nschool district lines,(cid:9) absent such a showing. Whether\nsuch a showing has been made as to events since 1954 in\nthe Richmond metropolitan area becomes, in essence, one\nof the ultimate questions of this case.\nFinally, in this connection, it has been suggested\nthat the existence of these three separate systems amounts\nto a racial classification, so that the state must justify\nthe existence of these separate systems by showing a com-\npelling non-discriminatory interest. But not every govern-\nmental line separating a predominantly black from a predom-\ninantly white unit is a racial classification. See Wright\nv. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52, 62, 68 (1964); cf. Whitcomb\nv. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124 (1971). And it may be that drawing\nsuch lines today would raise a stronger inference of racial\nclassification than merely, as here, maintaining the lines\nin the face of growing imbalance. Cf. Wright v. Council\nof City of Emporia, supra.\n7/ Cf., Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, 448 F.2d\n746 (5th Cir. 1971).\n- 12 -\n\n(c) Racial Imbalance and the Presumption of\nDiscrimination.\nA related issue raised in the district court's opinion\nconcerns the method by which discrimination is determined\nand assessed in one school system. That is, the Supreme\nCourt has held that substantial racial imbalance between\nschools in a dual system raises a presumption that their ra-\ncial compositions are a result of discriminatory state action.\nSwann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 26(cid:9) (1971). While\nthis presumption would appear to follow logically from the\nstate imposition of racial dualism struck down in Brown, the\nrationale for the presumption does not warrant its extension\nto substantially imbalanced school systems, even if formerly\ndual. That is, the racial composition of a particular school\nin one school system might be determined to a great degree\nby school authority action; the overall racial composition\nof a comparatively large school system is or can be determined\nby a myriad of factors -- some within the control of school\nauthorities and some not, some state action and some not.\nThe choices exercised by school authorities in the first in-\nstance (and by governmental authorities on a larger scale)\nhave at least a more immediate impact on particular schools,\nand it is the immediacy of the impact as well as the breadth\nof the action -- system-wide dualism -- which justifies the\napplication of the presumption against one-race schools\nin  school systems.\nindividual \n- 13 -\n\n(d) System or area wide duty to promote desegregation.\nThe Constitution imposes an affirmative duty upon\nschool authorities formerly operating dual systems to elimi-\nnate the vestiges and effects of that state-created dualism,\nand this duty encompasses site selection and school construc-\ntion. Swann v. Board of Education, supra. Each of the\nschool systems here have operated under such a duty, but\nthat has heretofore not meant that each was under a duty to\npromote desegregation between school systems. Therefore,\nif the evidence shows that some or all of these systems\nviolated their duty to promote desegregation within their\nrespective systems, this would not necessarily mean that an\n8/\ninter-system or area-wide violation has been made out. If\nthe district court analyzed the facts from the standpoint\nof an area-wide rather than a system-wide duty, this Court\nshould examine whether the principles of racial neutrality\nwithin school systems expressed in such cases as Bell v.\nSchool City of Gary, 324 F. 2d 209 (7th Cir., 1963) and\nDeal v. Cincinnati Board of Education, 369 F. 2d 55 (6th\nCir., 1966) should have been applied as between school systems.\n8/ For example, there could be circumstances where a new\nschool site could be picked which would promote within-\nsystem desegregation but hamper inter-system desegregation\n(or vice-versa); thus these duties could conflict with each\nother.\n- 14 -\n\n(e) Summary\nWe have outlined some areas in which the district\ncourt has applied existing concepts to a new situation --\nseparate school systems in a metropolitan area. We have\nsuggested some practical difficulties involved, and there\nremains an additional factor to consider; i.e., the defer-\nence to be given to state-created subdivision lines. While\nthe state's power in this area is limited by the federal\nconstitutional guarantees, Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364\nU.S. 339 (1960), a line of Supreme Court decisions has\nrecognized that under our federal system a state has sub-\nstantial power to subdivide its territory into local govern-\nmental units. See, e.g., United States v. Railroad Company,\n17 Wall. (84 U.S.) 322, 329 (1873); Hunter v. Pittsburgh,\n207 U.S. 161, 178-79 (1907); Faitoute Company v. Asbury Park,\n316 U.S. 502, 509 (1942); cf. Salsburg v. Maryland, 346 U.S.\n454, 522-53 (1954). This principle suggests that while\ncourts should \"scrutiniz[e] schemes allegedly conceived or\noperated as purposeful devices to further racial discrimi-\nnation,\" Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 149 (1971), a\nfinding of discrimination should not be based on the kinds of\npresumptions used in intra-district cases, and, indeed, the\npresumptions should be in favor of the long-standing lines.\n- 15 -\n\nII. Remedy\nThe remedy invoked by the district court -- consoli-\ndating the three school divisions and assigning their stu-\ndents so as to achieve a different racial mix -- raises\nquestions similar to those discussed above. This is because\nin equity cases the Chancellor has traditionally followed\nthe rule that \"the nature of the violation determines the\nscope of the remedy.\" Swann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S.\n1, 16.\nTherefore, it is not sufficient for the district\ncourt to find that there has been some inter-district dis-\ncrimination. The court must also define precisely what the\nviolation is, and then tailor a remedy to fit the violation.\nThe broad brush applied by the court below makes it diffi-\ncult, on review, to say precisely what the violation, if any,\nwas. But the opinion of the court below suggests that in-\nstead of tailoring the remedy, the court used a blanket\napproach. Although the Swann decision may authorize such an\napproach in intra-system cases, it does not authorize it\nhere (see discussion pp. ti to 14, supra).\nIf the violation here is state-imposed segregation\nas between neighboring schools across school system lines\n- 16 -\n\n(see opinion, p. 242 ), desegregation as between those\nparticular schools might be warranted. If the violation\nis a denial of free access to housing in particular resi-\ndential areas (and therefore the schools which serve those\nareas), the court might require that the children be given\naccess to those schools; or it could join those responsible\nfor the housing discrimination and provide relief against\nthem. If there is proof of an inferior curriculum or the\nunfair allocation of money as among the systems, there may\nbe specific relief for those violations. See Serrano v.\nPriest, 5 Cal. 3d 584 (1971); Rodriguez v. San Antonio\nIndependent School District,(cid:9) F. Supp.(cid:9) , (W.D. Tex.,\n1971); Van Dusartz v. Hatfield, 334 F. Supp. 870 (D. Minn.,\n1971).\nIt is not clear here whether the district court's\nblanket relief stemmed from a view that Swann required such\nrelief or from the fact that this was the only relief sug-\ngested. Ordinarily, in desegregation cases where the issue\nof violation is presented, the district court holds a bi-\nfurcated hearing -- first it has a hearing as to violation;\nif it finds a violation it orders the development of plans\nand holds a hearing on the plans. Indeed, this is the pro-\ncedure being followed in the other inter-district metropolitan\n- 17 -\n\ncases cited by the district court at pages 77-81 of its\nopinion. Even the broad discretion authorized by Swann arises\nonly after the school authorities have defaulted by failing\nto propose an adequate plan. No such default has occurred\n9/\nhere; the district court found a violation and imposed a\nremedy simultaneously.\nIII. Conclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, we would suggest four\npossible courses of action by this Court:\n(a) Defer decision pending resolution of Keyes\nand of the legislative proposals now before Congress.\n(b) Scrutinize the district court's opinion and\nthe record in light of the considerations listed\nabove, and determine what if any, violation exists\nand what, if any, relief is warranted; enter an\norder of remand or reversal accordingly.\n(c) Set forth guidelines for analyzing whether\na violation exists and for deciding what, if any,\n9/ The district court apparently encouraged the defendants\nto prepare or participate in the preparation of plans. How-\never, since the violation(s) that could have been found varied\nconsiderably in scope, it was practically impossible for the\ndefendants to prepare plans tailored to remedy the alleged\nviolations in advance of the violation finding.\n- 18 -\n\nrelief is warranted; remand to the district\ncourt for application of these guidelines.\n(d) Find that the legal standards used by\nthe district court were erroneous and that\ntherefore the decision below should be re-\nversed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nBRIAN P.

Therefore, we are not sufficiently apprised\nof all of the factual considerations which may prove deter-\nminative of at least some questions raised by this appeal.\nNevertheless, this case raises questions of first impres-\nsion in the appellate courts concerning the scope of school\ndesegregation duties and remedies, and related questions of\nlaw and policy which have not directly been raised in previ-\nous cases arising under Brown v. Board of Education, 347\nU.S. 483 (1954) and 349 U.S. 294 (1955). It is these novel\naspects that we discuss in this memorandum in an attempt to\noutline, in broad form, some legal and policy considerations\nwhich we think may assist this Court in deciding the instant\nappeal.\nThis is not primarily a case about segregation re-\nquired by state law, because state law has never required\nsegregation as between Richmond and the neighboring school\nsystems. The issue, instead, is whether the maintenance of\nthe separate school divisions constitutes racial discrimina-\ntion. The history of the state-imposed official policy of\nsegregation within school subdivisions is only an element\nof the proof relating to the maintenance of the division\n- 2 -\n\nlines. Aside from that history, the issue in this case\nappears, in large measure, to be whether school authorities\nhave the affirmative duty to overcome the racial impaction\nbetween separate school divisions resulting from resi-\ndential segregation caused, in part, by public and private\ndiscrimination. Aspects of that issue are now under con-\nsideration by the Congress of the United States (proposed\nI/\nEqual Educational Opportunities Act of 1972) and by the\nSupreme Court of the United States. (Keyes v. School Dis-\ntrict No. 1, O.T. 1971 No. 71-507). We therefore think this\nCourt should consider whether deferral of a decision would\nbe appropriate pending action by Congress (cf. Baker v.\nCarr's reference to \"the impossibility of deciding without\nan initial policy determination of a kind clearly for non-\njudicial discretion\", 369 U.S. 186, 217 ) or by the Supreme\nCourt (see the attached letter from the clerk of the Fifth\nCircuit Court of Appeals relating to Cisneros v. Corpus\nj/ See, e.g., Sec. 404 of H.R. 13915:\nIn the formulation of remedies under\nsection 401 or 402 of this Act, the lines\ndrawn by a State, subdividing its terri-\ntory into separate school districts, shall\nnot be ignored or altered except where it\nis established that the lines were drawn\nfor the purpose, and had the effect, of\nsegregating children among public schools\non the basis of race, color, or national\norigin.\n- 3 -\n\nChristi). The following discussion not only bears on the\nmerits of the case, but also on the question whether the\nissues presented are of such a nature that deferral would\nbe appropriate.\nI. The Constitutional Violation\nFederal courts have found discriminatory, and en-\njoined where appropriate, the creation of separate school\ndistricts in formerly dual systems where the purpose and\neffect of the creation was to impede desegregation; e.g.,\nLee v. Macon County Board of Education, 448 F. 2d 746 (5th\nCir., 1971); Burleson v. County Board of Election Commis-\nsioners, 308 F. Supp. 352 (E.D. Ark., 1970), aff'd 432 F.\n2d 1356 (8th Cir., 1970); cf. Wright v. Council of the City\nof Emporia, 442 F. 2d 570 (4th Cir., 1971), cert. granted,\nNo. 70-130 (0.T. 1971), and companion cases. Federal courts\nhave also enjoined the maintenance of rural black school dis-\ntricts which were created as instruments of dualism, and\nordered consolidation of these with neighboring white dis-\ntricts; e.g., Haney v. County Board of Education of Sevier\nCounty, 429 F. 2d 364 (8th Cir., 1970); United States v.\nTexas, 321 F. Supp. 1043 (E.D. Texas 1970), aff'd 447 F.\n2d 441 (5th Cir., 1971), cert. denied,(cid:9) U.S.(cid:9) (1971).\n- 4 -\n\nWhile these and other cases hold that a state's power\nto establish and maintain particular governmental subdivision\nlines is subject to the equal protection clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment, Cf., Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S.\n339 (1960), they do not dispose of the question raised in\nthis case. Here the constitutional attack is directed\nsolely to the maintenance of longstanding political sub-\ndivision lines -- lines drawn before Brown which, at the\ndate of Brown, divided the area covered by the three school\nsystems in question into majority white segments of a rela-\n2/\ntively minor racial variation.\nThe Equal Protection Clause does not require a parti-\ncular racial balance in schools in a single school district,\neven if formerly dual, Swann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S.\n1, 22-25 (1971), nor does it require racial balance between\nseparate school districts in a single state, Spencer v.\nKugler, 326 F. Supp. 1235 (D. N.J. 1971), aff'd(cid:9) U.S.\n(1972). In fact, Spencer stands for the proposition that, at\nleast in states not recently operating dual school systems,\nextreme racial imbalance, without more, does not require\n2/ Richmond's school system was 43.5% black in 1954-55,\nand Chesterfield's 20.47 black and Henrico's 10.4% black in\n1953-54.\n- 5 -\n\nthe reformation of neutrally established school district\nboundary lines. See 326 F. Supp. at 1243.\nThe question then becomes whether the maintenance\nto the present day of these neutrally established school\ndivision lines in the Richmond metropolitan area is\nracially discriminatory. This, in turn, requires an\nexamination of the correctness of the district court's\nmethod of analysis of inter-system discrimination. On\nbalance, the district court appears to have applied to\nschool systems collectively the concepts of racial dis-\ncrimination heretofore applied to individual schools in\none school system, apparently basing its decision on the\nfact that the Fourteenth Amendment speaks only to the\nstates. It is true that numerous cases have recognized\nthat state as well as local school authorities have affir-\nmative obligations to take steps to eradicate the discrimi-\nnation inherent in dual school systems. See, e.g., Cooper\nM\nv. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 16-17 (1958); Griffin v. County\nSchool Board, 377 U.S. 218 (1964); Lee v. Macon County\nBoard of Education, 267 F. Supp. 458 (M.D. Ala., 1967),\naff'd sub nom Wallace v. United States, 389 U.S. 215 (1967);\n- 6 -\n\nA\nUnited States v. Texas, 321 F. Supp. 1043 (E.D. Tex., 1970),\n330 F. Supp. 235 (E.D. Tex., 1971); modified and affirmed,\n447 F. 2d 441. (5th Cir., 1971); stay denied, 404 U.S. 1206,\ncert. denied,(cid:9) U.S.(cid:9) (1972); cf. North Carolina Board\n3'\nof Education v. Swann, 402 U.S. 43 (1971).\nHowever, the district court appears not to have\nacknowledged that this application involves, in the circum-\nstances of this case, a definite extension of legal prin-\nciples beyond existing court decisions. The logical under-\npinnings of the law and the ramifications of such a major\nextension should be fully explored by this Court. These\nlegal concepts and the propriety of their application to\nseveral school systems at once in a major metropolitan\narea are discussed below.\n3/ \nThe defendants in this case include an agency of the\nstate of Virginia with state-wide powers (the State Board\nof Education) as well as subsidiary officials of the state\ngovernment with only local powers (the Boards of Education\nand Boards of Supervisors of Henrico and Chesterfield\nCounties).\n- 7 -\n\n(a) Racial Identifiability\nThis concept has traditionally been used in school\ndesegregation cases in assessing whether the effects of state-\nimposed dualism have been eradicated at a particular school.\nThus, school authorities have been charged with the duty to\n\"convert promptly to a system without a 'white' school and\na 'Negro' school, but just schools.\" Green v. County School\nBoard, 391 U.S. 430, 442 (1968). The heart of this concept\nis the notion that a particular school is designated by the\nstate for students of one race, with a concomitant community\nperception that schools designated for black students are in-\nferior. The Court in Brown expressed the same notion (albeit\nexpressed in terms of students rather than schools) when it\nsaid:\nWe come then to the question presented:\nDoes segregation of children in public\nschools solely on the basis of race,\neven though the physical facilities and\nother 'tangible' factors may be equal,\ndeprive the children of the minority\ngroup of equal educational opportunities?\nWe believe that it does. 347 U.S. 483\nat 493.\nThe district court concluded that the school systems\nhere were racially identifiable, vis-a-vis each other, on the\nbasis of statistical evidence, expert testimony and evidence\nof state action which had the effect of limiting black resi-\ndence to the area circumscribed by the boundaries of Richmond.\n- 8 -\n\nCourts have often used statistical evidence in assessing\nracial identifiability of particular schools, but this\nassessment has been vis-a-vis schools within a dual system,\nand in the context of deciding whether dualism had been\neradicated. Cf. Swann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 26\n(1971). Courts have not often focused on expert testimony\nin determining the existence of racial identifiability, and\nit would appear that this Court should examine the district\n4/\ncourt's findings relating to the expert testimony,(cid:9) to\ndetermine whether they add anything to the statistics, so\nas to support the conclusion of the district court that in\nthe Richmond area, in the facts of this case, these school\nsystems are racially identifiable. In assessing the correct-\nness of the district court's conclusion about the imbalance,\nthis Court must decide what significance should be attached\nto the fact that each of the three school systems has hereto-\nfore become unitary as required by law. This means that the\nracial identifiability of the schools within the system has,\nto the extent feasible, been erased if one looks at each\n4 / See, for example, the discussion of Dr. Pettigrew's\ntestimony, pp. 249-254 of the district court's opinion of\nJanuary 5, 1972. It seems clear that Dr. Pettigrew objects\nto schools over 40% black (in areas where the school popula-\ntion is under 40% black) regardless of whether the condition\nstemmed from state action. But the concept of racial identi-\nfiability includes in it, as an essential ingredient, the\nelement of state action.\n- 9 -\n\nsystem separately. The Court should also decide whether it\nwas proper to compare the three unitary school systems with\neach other, or whether the inquiry should have been limited\nto whether state action contributed to racial identifiability\nof particular schools as among the three divisions. For\nexample, if the state had built a high school on the Richmond\nborder to serve black children from Richmond and Henrico\nCounty and that school is 78% black today it might be per-\nceived as racially identifiable if located 1.4 miles from a\n967 white high school in Henrico County built for white stu-\n5 /\ndents from both systems,(cid:9) but the same result does not follow\nin comparing a 90% white school in southern Chesterfield County\nwith a 70% black school 20 miles away in Richmond.\n(b) Discrimination by public and private agencies\nother than school authorities.\nThis Court has previously said that school authorities\nmay not superimpose individual school zone lines upon racially\nsegregated housing patterns enforced by state or private dis-\ncrimination. Brewer v. School Board, 397 F.2d 37 (4th Ciro\n1968). See also, Davis v. School District, 309 F. Supp. 734,\n742 (E.D. Mich. 1970); aff'd 443 F.2d 573 (6th Cir. 1971);\ncert. denied, 404 U.S. 913 (1971). The district court\n5/ Cf. January 5 Memorandum Opinion, p. 242.\n- 10 -\n\napplied this principle to the three school systems covering\nthe Richmond metropolitan area, finding that blacks had been,\nthrough various discriminatory practices, segregated and\nconfined in the Richmond City system. No other court has,\nprior to the decision below, based interdistrict school relief\non such a finding. But see, Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing\nAuthority, 448 F.2d 731 (7th Cir. 1971). Regardless of whether\nthe Brewer doctrine should be extended beyond school division\nlines, there is the further question whether the specific\nevidence cited by the district court supports its ultimate\nfindings that political subdivision lines in fact follow the\n6/\nracial residential lines(cid:9) and that the segregation was a\nresult of public and private discrimination. Residential\nracial segregation has many causes, of which racial discrimina-\ntion is one.\nBeyond this, Swann teaches that when school districts\nachieve unitariness, district courts should not be required\nto intervene further absent a showing that \"either the\nschool authorities or some other agency of the State has\ndeliberately attempted to fix or alter demographic patterns\n6/ There are approximately 13,500 white students in Richmond\nand 5184 black students in the two counties in 1971-72.\n- 11 -\n\nto affect the racial composition of the schools.\" 402 U.S.\nat 32. It would appear, reasoning from this, that dis-\ntrict courts should not require interdistrict relief,\nwhere there is no question of changes or alterations in\nschool district lines,(cid:9) absent such a showing. Whether\nsuch a showing has been made as to events since 1954 in\nthe Richmond metropolitan area becomes, in essence, one\nof the ultimate questions of this case.\nFinally, in this connection, it has been suggested\nthat the existence of these three separate systems amounts\nto a racial classification, so that the state must justify\nthe existence of these separate systems by showing a com-\npelling non-discriminatory interest. But not every govern-\nmental line separating a predominantly black from a predom-\ninantly white unit is a racial classification. See Wright\nv. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52, 62, 68 (1964); cf. Whitcomb\nv. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124 (1971). And it may be that drawing\nsuch lines today would raise a stronger inference of racial\nclassification than merely, as here, maintaining the lines\nin the face of growing imbalance. Cf. Wright v. Council\nof City of Emporia, supra.\n7/ Cf., Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, 448 F.2d\n746 (5th Cir. 1971).\n- 12 -\n\n(c) Racial Imbalance and the Presumption of\nDiscrimination.\nA related issue raised in the district court's opinion\nconcerns the method by which discrimination is determined\nand assessed in one school system. That is, the Supreme\nCourt has held that substantial racial imbalance between\nschools in a dual system raises a presumption that their ra-\ncial compositions are a result of discriminatory state action.\nSwann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 26(cid:9) (1971). While\nthis presumption would appear to follow logically from the\nstate imposition of racial dualism struck down in Brown, the\nrationale for the presumption does not warrant its extension\nto substantially imbalanced school systems, even if formerly\ndual. That is, the racial composition of a particular school\nin one school system might be determined to a great degree\nby school authority action; the overall racial composition\nof a comparatively large school system is or can be determined\nby a myriad of factors -- some within the control of school\nauthorities and some not, some state action and some not.\nThe choices exercised by school authorities in the first in-\nstance (and by governmental authorities on a larger scale)\nhave at least a more immediate impact on particular schools,\nand it is the immediacy of the impact as well as the breadth\nof the action -- system-wide dualism -- which justifies the\napplication of the presumption against one-race schools\nin  school systems.\nindividual \n- 13 -\n\n(d) System or area wide duty to promote desegregation.\nThe Constitution imposes an affirmative duty upon\nschool authorities formerly operating dual systems to elimi-\nnate the vestiges and effects of that state-created dualism,\nand this duty encompasses site selection and school construc-\ntion. Swann v. Board of Education, supra. Each of the\nschool systems here have operated under such a duty, but\nthat has heretofore not meant that each was under a duty to\npromote desegregation between school systems. Therefore,\nif the evidence shows that some or all of these systems\nviolated their duty to promote desegregation within their\nrespective systems, this would not necessarily mean that an\n8/\ninter-system or area-wide violation has been made out. If\nthe district court analyzed the facts from the standpoint\nof an area-wide rather than a system-wide duty, this Court\nshould examine whether the principles of racial neutrality\nwithin school systems expressed in such cases as Bell v.\nSchool City of Gary, 324 F. 2d 209 (7th Cir., 1963) and\nDeal v. Cincinnati Board of Education, 369 F. 2d 55 (6th\nCir., 1966) should have been applied as between school systems.\n8/ For example, there could be circumstances where a new\nschool site could be picked which would promote within-\nsystem desegregation but hamper inter-system desegregation\n(or vice-versa); thus these duties could conflict with each\nother.\n- 14 -\n\n(e) Summary\nWe have outlined some areas in which the district\ncourt has applied existing concepts to a new situation --\nseparate school systems in a metropolitan area. We have\nsuggested some practical difficulties involved, and there\nremains an additional factor to consider; i.e., the defer-\nence to be given to state-created subdivision lines. While\nthe state's power in this area is limited by the federal\nconstitutional guarantees, Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364\nU.S. 339 (1960), a line of Supreme Court decisions has\nrecognized that under our federal system a state has sub-\nstantial power to subdivide its territory into local govern-\nmental units. See, e.g., United States v. Railroad Company,\n17 Wall. (84 U.S.) 322, 329 (1873); Hunter v. Pittsburgh,\n207 U.S. 161, 178-79 (1907); Faitoute Company v. Asbury Park,\n316 U.S. 502, 509 (1942); cf. Salsburg v. Maryland, 346 U.S.\n454, 522-53 (1954). This principle suggests that while\ncourts should \"scrutiniz[e] schemes allegedly conceived or\noperated as purposeful devices to further racial discrimi-\nnation,\" Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 149 (1971), a\nfinding of discrimination should not be based on the kinds of\npresumptions used in intra-district cases, and, indeed, the\npresumptions should be in favor of the long-standing lines.\n- 15 -\n\nII. Remedy\nThe remedy invoked by the district court -- consoli-\ndating the three school divisions and assigning their stu-\ndents so as to achieve a different racial mix -- raises\nquestions similar to those discussed above. This is because\nin equity cases the Chancellor has traditionally followed\nthe rule that \"the nature of the violation determines the\nscope of the remedy.\" Swann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S.\n1, 16.\nTherefore, it is not sufficient for the district\ncourt to find that there has been some inter-district dis-\ncrimination. The court must also define precisely what the\nviolation is, and then tailor a remedy to fit the violation.\nThe broad brush applied by the court below makes it diffi-\ncult, on review, to say precisely what the violation, if any,\nwas. But the opinion of the court below suggests that in-\nstead of tailoring the remedy, the court used a blanket\napproach. Although the Swann decision may authorize such an\napproach in intra-system cases, it does not authorize it\nhere (see discussion pp. ti to 14, supra).\nIf the violation here is state-imposed segregation\nas between neighboring schools across school system lines\n- 16 -\n\n(see opinion, p. 242 ), desegregation as between those\nparticular schools might be warranted. If the violation\nis a denial of free access to housing in particular resi-\ndential areas (and therefore the schools which serve those\nareas), the court might require that the children be given\naccess to those schools; or it could join those responsible\nfor the housing discrimination and provide relief against\nthem. If there is proof of an inferior curriculum or the\nunfair allocation of money as among the systems, there may\nbe specific relief for those violations. See Serrano v.\nPriest, 5 Cal. 3d 584 (1971); Rodriguez v. San Antonio\nIndependent School District,(cid:9) F. Supp.(cid:9) , (W.D. Tex.,\n1971); Van Dusartz v. Hatfield, 334 F. Supp. 870 (D. Minn.,\n1971).\nIt is not clear here whether the district court's\nblanket relief stemmed from a view that Swann required such\nrelief or from the fact that this was the only relief sug-\ngested. Ordinarily, in desegregation cases where the issue\nof violation is presented, the district court holds a bi-\nfurcated hearing -- first it has a hearing as to violation;\nif it finds a violation it orders the development of plans\nand holds a hearing on the plans. Indeed, this is the pro-\ncedure being followed in the other inter-district metropolitan\n- 17 -\n\ncases cited by the district court at pages 77-81 of its\nopinion. Even the broad discretion authorized by Swann arises\nonly after the school authorities have defaulted by failing\nto propose an adequate plan. No such default has occurred\n9/\nhere; the district court found a violation and imposed a\nremedy simultaneously.\nIII. Conclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, we would suggest four\npossible courses of action by this Court:\n(a) Defer decision pending resolution of Keyes\nand of the legislative proposals now before Congress.\n(b) Scrutinize the district court's opinion and\nthe record in light of the considerations listed\nabove, and determine what if any, violation exists\nand what, if any, relief is warranted; enter an\norder of remand or reversal accordingly.\n(c) Set forth guidelines for analyzing whether\na violation exists and for deciding what, if any,\n9/ The district court apparently encouraged the defendants\nto prepare or participate in the preparation of plans. How-\never, since the violation(s) that could have been found varied\nconsiderably in scope, it was practically impossible for the\ndefendants to prepare plans tailored to remedy the alleged\nviolations in advance of the violation finding.\n- 18 -\n\nrelief is warranted; remand to the district\ncourt for application of these guidelines.\n(d) Find that the legal standards used by\nthe district court were erroneous and that\ntherefore the decision below should be re-\nversed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nBRIAN P.

Therefore, we are not sufficiently apprised\nof all of the factual considerations which may prove deter-\nminative of at least some questions raised by this appeal.\nNevertheless, this case raises questions of first impres-\nsion in the appellate courts concerning the scope of school\ndesegregation duties and remedies, and related questions of\nlaw and policy which have not directly been raised in previ-\nous cases arising under Brown v. Board of Education, 347\nU.S. 483 (1954) and 349 U.S. 294 (1955). It is these novel\naspects that we discuss in this memorandum in an attempt to\noutline, in broad form, some legal and policy considerations\nwhich we think may assist this Court in deciding the instant\nappeal.\nThis is not primarily a case about segregation re-\nquired by state law, because state law has never required\nsegregation as between Richmond and the neighboring school\nsystems. The issue, instead, is whether the maintenance of\nthe separate school divisions constitutes racial discrimina-\ntion. The history of the state-imposed official policy of\nsegregation within school subdivisions is only an element\nof the proof relating to the maintenance of the division\n- 2 -\n\nlines. Aside from that history, the issue in this case\nappears, in large measure, to be whether school authorities\nhave the affirmative duty to overcome the racial impaction\nbetween separate school divisions resulting from resi-\ndential segregation caused, in part, by public and private\ndiscrimination. Aspects of that issue are now under con-\nsideration by the Congress of the United States (proposed\nI/\nEqual Educational Opportunities Act of 1972) and by the\nSupreme Court of the United States. (Keyes v. School Dis-\ntrict No. 1, O.T. 1971 No. 71-507). We therefore think this\nCourt should consider whether deferral of a decision would\nbe appropriate pending action by Congress (cf. Baker v.\nCarr's reference to \"the impossibility of deciding without\nan initial policy determination of a kind clearly for non-\njudicial discretion\", 369 U.S. 186, 217 ) or by the Supreme\nCourt (see the attached letter from the clerk of the Fifth\nCircuit Court of Appeals relating to Cisneros v. Corpus\nj/ See, e.g., Sec. 404 of H.R. 13915:\nIn the formulation of remedies under\nsection 401 or 402 of this Act, the lines\ndrawn by a State, subdividing its terri-\ntory into separate school districts, shall\nnot be ignored or altered except where it\nis established that the lines were drawn\nfor the purpose, and had the effect, of\nsegregating children among public schools\non the basis of race, color, or national\norigin.\n- 3 -\n\nChristi). The following discussion not only bears on the\nmerits of the case, but also on the question whether the\nissues presented are of such a nature that deferral would\nbe appropriate.\nI. The Constitutional Violation\nFederal courts have found discriminatory, and en-\njoined where appropriate, the creation of separate school\ndistricts in formerly dual systems where the purpose and\neffect of the creation was to impede desegregation; e.g.,\nLee v. Macon County Board of Education, 448 F. 2d 746 (5th\nCir., 1971); Burleson v. County Board of Election Commis-\nsioners, 308 F. Supp. 352 (E.D. Ark., 1970), aff'd 432 F.\n2d 1356 (8th Cir., 1970); cf. Wright v. Council of the City\nof Emporia, 442 F. 2d 570 (4th Cir., 1971), cert. granted,\nNo. 70-130 (0.T. 1971), and companion cases. Federal courts\nhave also enjoined the maintenance of rural black school dis-\ntricts which were created as instruments of dualism, and\nordered consolidation of these with neighboring white dis-\ntricts; e.g., Haney v. County Board of Education of Sevier\nCounty, 429 F. 2d 364 (8th Cir., 1970); United States v.\nTexas, 321 F. Supp. 1043 (E.D. Texas 1970), aff'd 447 F.\n2d 441 (5th Cir., 1971), cert. denied,(cid:9) U.S.(cid:9) (1971).\n- 4 -\n\nWhile these and other cases hold that a state's power\nto establish and maintain particular governmental subdivision\nlines is subject to the equal protection clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment, Cf., Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S.\n339 (1960), they do not dispose of the question raised in\nthis case. Here the constitutional attack is directed\nsolely to the maintenance of longstanding political sub-\ndivision lines -- lines drawn before Brown which, at the\ndate of Brown, divided the area covered by the three school\nsystems in question into majority white segments of a rela-\n2/\ntively minor racial variation.\nThe Equal Protection Clause does not require a parti-\ncular racial balance in schools in a single school district,\neven if formerly dual, Swann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S.\n1, 22-25 (1971), nor does it require racial balance between\nseparate school districts in a single state, Spencer v.\nKugler, 326 F. Supp. 1235 (D. N.J. 1971), aff'd(cid:9) U.S.\n(1972). In fact, Spencer stands for the proposition that, at\nleast in states not recently operating dual school systems,\nextreme racial imbalance, without more, does not require\n2/ Richmond's school system was 43.5% black in 1954-55,\nand Chesterfield's 20.47 black and Henrico's 10.4% black in\n1953-54.\n- 5 -\n\nthe reformation of neutrally established school district\nboundary lines. See 326 F. Supp. at 1243.\nThe question then becomes whether the maintenance\nto the present day of these neutrally established school\ndivision lines in the Richmond metropolitan area is\nracially discriminatory. This, in turn, requires an\nexamination of the correctness of the district court's\nmethod of analysis of inter-system discrimination. On\nbalance, the district court appears to have applied to\nschool systems collectively the concepts of racial dis-\ncrimination heretofore applied to individual schools in\none school system, apparently basing its decision on the\nfact that the Fourteenth Amendment speaks only to the\nstates. It is true that numerous cases have recognized\nthat state as well as local school authorities have affir-\nmative obligations to take steps to eradicate the discrimi-\nnation inherent in dual school systems. See, e.g., Cooper\nM\nv. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 16-17 (1958); Griffin v. County\nSchool Board, 377 U.S. 218 (1964); Lee v. Macon County\nBoard of Education, 267 F. Supp. 458 (M.D. Ala., 1967),\naff'd sub nom Wallace v. United States, 389 U.S. 215 (1967);\n- 6 -\n\nA\nUnited States v. Texas, 321 F. Supp. 1043 (E.D. Tex., 1970),\n330 F. Supp. 235 (E.D. Tex., 1971); modified and affirmed,\n447 F. 2d 441. (5th Cir., 1971); stay denied, 404 U.S. 1206,\ncert. denied,(cid:9) U.S.(cid:9) (1972); cf. North Carolina Board\n3'\nof Education v. Swann, 402 U.S. 43 (1971).\nHowever, the district court appears not to have\nacknowledged that this application involves, in the circum-\nstances of this case, a definite extension of legal prin-\nciples beyond existing court decisions. The logical under-\npinnings of the law and the ramifications of such a major\nextension should be fully explored by this Court. These\nlegal concepts and the propriety of their application to\nseveral school systems at once in a major metropolitan\narea are discussed below.\n3/ \nThe defendants in this case include an agency of the\nstate of Virginia with state-wide powers (the State Board\nof Education) as well as subsidiary officials of the state\ngovernment with only local powers (the Boards of Education\nand Boards of Supervisors of Henrico and Chesterfield\nCounties).\n- 7 -\n\n(a) Racial Identifiability\nThis concept has traditionally been used in school\ndesegregation cases in assessing whether the effects of state-\nimposed dualism have been eradicated at a particular school.\nThus, school authorities have been charged with the duty to\n\"convert promptly to a system without a 'white' school and\na 'Negro' school, but just schools.\" Green v. County School\nBoard, 391 U.S. 430, 442 (1968). The heart of this concept\nis the notion that a particular school is designated by the\nstate for students of one race, with a concomitant community\nperception that schools designated for black students are in-\nferior. The Court in Brown expressed the same notion (albeit\nexpressed in terms of students rather than schools) when it\nsaid:\nWe come then to the question presented:\nDoes segregation of children in public\nschools solely on the basis of race,\neven though the physical facilities and\nother 'tangible' factors may be equal,\ndeprive the children of the minority\ngroup of equal educational opportunities?\nWe believe that it does. 347 U.S. 483\nat 493.\nThe district court concluded that the school systems\nhere were racially identifiable, vis-a-vis each other, on the\nbasis of statistical evidence, expert testimony and evidence\nof state action which had the effect of limiting black resi-\ndence to the area circumscribed by the boundaries of Richmond.\n- 8 -\n\nCourts have often used statistical evidence in assessing\nracial identifiability of particular schools, but this\nassessment has been vis-a-vis schools within a dual system,\nand in the context of deciding whether dualism had been\neradicated. Cf. Swann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 26\n(1971). Courts have not often focused on expert testimony\nin determining the existence of racial identifiability, and\nit would appear that this Court should examine the district\n4/\ncourt's findings relating to the expert testimony,(cid:9) to\ndetermine whether they add anything to the statistics, so\nas to support the conclusion of the district court that in\nthe Richmond area, in the facts of this case, these school\nsystems are racially identifiable. In assessing the correct-\nness of the district court's conclusion about the imbalance,\nthis Court must decide what significance should be attached\nto the fact that each of the three school systems has hereto-\nfore become unitary as required by law. This means that the\nracial identifiability of the schools within the system has,\nto the extent feasible, been erased if one looks at each\n4 / See, for example, the discussion of Dr. Pettigrew's\ntestimony, pp. 249-254 of the district court's opinion of\nJanuary 5, 1972. It seems clear that Dr. Pettigrew objects\nto schools over 40% black (in areas where the school popula-\ntion is under 40% black) regardless of whether the condition\nstemmed from state action. But the concept of racial identi-\nfiability includes in it, as an essential ingredient, the\nelement of state action.\n- 9 -\n\nsystem separately. The Court should also decide whether it\nwas proper to compare the three unitary school systems with\neach other, or whether the inquiry should have been limited\nto whether state action contributed to racial identifiability\nof particular schools as among the three divisions. For\nexample, if the state had built a high school on the Richmond\nborder to serve black children from Richmond and Henrico\nCounty and that school is 78% black today it might be per-\nceived as racially identifiable if located 1.4 miles from a\n967 white high school in Henrico County built for white stu-\n5 /\ndents from both systems,(cid:9) but the same result does not follow\nin comparing a 90% white school in southern Chesterfield County\nwith a 70% black school 20 miles away in Richmond.\n(b) Discrimination by public and private agencies\nother than school authorities.\nThis Court has previously said that school authorities\nmay not superimpose individual school zone lines upon racially\nsegregated housing patterns enforced by state or private dis-\ncrimination. Brewer v. School Board, 397 F.2d 37 (4th Ciro\n1968). See also, Davis v. School District, 309 F. Supp. 734,\n742 (E.D. Mich. 1970); aff'd 443 F.2d 573 (6th Cir. 1971);\ncert. denied, 404 U.S. 913 (1971). The district court\n5/ Cf. January 5 Memorandum Opinion, p. 242.\n- 10 -\n\napplied this principle to the three school systems covering\nthe Richmond metropolitan area, finding that blacks had been,\nthrough various discriminatory practices, segregated and\nconfined in the Richmond City system. No other court has,\nprior to the decision below, based interdistrict school relief\non such a finding. But see, Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing\nAuthority, 448 F.2d 731 (7th Cir. 1971). Regardless of whether\nthe Brewer doctrine should be extended beyond school division\nlines, there is the further question whether the specific\nevidence cited by the district court supports its ultimate\nfindings that political subdivision lines in fact follow the\n6/\nracial residential lines(cid:9) and that the segregation was a\nresult of public and private discrimination. Residential\nracial segregation has many causes, of which racial discrimina-\ntion is one.\nBeyond this, Swann teaches that when school districts\nachieve unitariness, district courts should not be required\nto intervene further absent a showing that \"either the\nschool authorities or some other agency of the State has\ndeliberately attempted to fix or alter demographic patterns\n6/ There are approximately 13,500 white students in Richmond\nand 5184 black students in the two counties in 1971-72.\n- 11 -\n\nto affect the racial composition of the schools.\" 402 U.S.\nat 32. It would appear, reasoning from this, that dis-\ntrict courts should not require interdistrict relief,\nwhere there is no question of changes or alterations in\nschool district lines,(cid:9) absent such a showing. Whether\nsuch a showing has been made as to events since 1954 in\nthe Richmond metropolitan area becomes, in essence, one\nof the ultimate questions of this case.\nFinally, in this connection, it has been suggested\nthat the existence of these three separate systems amounts\nto a racial classification, so that the state must justify\nthe existence of these separate systems by showing a com-\npelling non-discriminatory interest. But not every govern-\nmental line separating a predominantly black from a predom-\ninantly white unit is a racial classification. See Wright\nv. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52, 62, 68 (1964); cf. Whitcomb\nv. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124 (1971). And it may be that drawing\nsuch lines today would raise a stronger inference of racial\nclassification than merely, as here, maintaining the lines\nin the face of growing imbalance. Cf. Wright v. Council\nof City of Emporia, supra.\n7/ Cf., Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, 448 F.2d\n746 (5th Cir. 1971).\n- 12 -\n\n(c) Racial Imbalance and the Presumption of\nDiscrimination.\nA related issue raised in the district court's opinion\nconcerns the method by which discrimination is determined\nand assessed in one school system. That is, the Supreme\nCourt has held that substantial racial imbalance between\nschools in a dual system raises a presumption that their ra-\ncial compositions are a result of discriminatory state action.\nSwann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 26(cid:9) (1971). While\nthis presumption would appear to follow logically from the\nstate imposition of racial dualism struck down in Brown, the\nrationale for the presumption does not warrant its extension\nto substantially imbalanced school systems, even if formerly\ndual. That is, the racial composition of a particular school\nin one school system might be determined to a great degree\nby school authority action; the overall racial composition\nof a comparatively large school system is or can be determined\nby a myriad of factors -- some within the control of school\nauthorities and some not, some state action and some not.\nThe choices exercised by school authorities in the first in-\nstance (and by governmental authorities on a larger scale)\nhave at least a more immediate impact on particular schools,\nand it is the immediacy of the impact as well as the breadth\nof the action -- system-wide dualism -- which justifies the\napplication of the presumption against one-race schools\nin  school systems.\nindividual \n- 13 -\n\n(d) System or area wide duty to promote desegregation.\nThe Constitution imposes an affirmative duty upon\nschool authorities formerly operating dual systems to elimi-\nnate the vestiges and effects of that state-created dualism,\nand this duty encompasses site selection and school construc-\ntion. Swann v. Board of Education, supra. Each of the\nschool systems here have operated under such a duty, but\nthat has heretofore not meant that each was under a duty to\npromote desegregation between school systems. Therefore,\nif the evidence shows that some or all of these systems\nviolated their duty to promote desegregation within their\nrespective systems, this would not necessarily mean that an\n8/\ninter-system or area-wide violation has been made out. If\nthe district court analyzed the facts from the standpoint\nof an area-wide rather than a system-wide duty, this Court\nshould examine whether the principles of racial neutrality\nwithin school systems expressed in such cases as Bell v.\nSchool City of Gary, 324 F. 2d 209 (7th Cir., 1963) and\nDeal v. Cincinnati Board of Education, 369 F. 2d 55 (6th\nCir., 1966) should have been applied as between school systems.\n8/ For example, there could be circumstances where a new\nschool site could be picked which would promote within-\nsystem desegregation but hamper inter-system desegregation\n(or vice-versa); thus these duties could conflict with each\nother.\n- 14 -\n\n(e) Summary\nWe have outlined some areas in which the district\ncourt has applied existing concepts to a new situation --\nseparate school systems in a metropolitan area. We have\nsuggested some practical difficulties involved, and there\nremains an additional factor to consider; i.e., the defer-\nence to be given to state-created subdivision lines. While\nthe state's power in this area is limited by the federal\nconstitutional guarantees, Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364\nU.S. 339 (1960), a line of Supreme Court decisions has\nrecognized that under our federal system a state has sub-\nstantial power to subdivide its territory into local govern-\nmental units. See, e.g., United States v. Railroad Company,\n17 Wall. (84 U.S.) 322, 329 (1873); Hunter v. Pittsburgh,\n207 U.S. 161, 178-79 (1907); Faitoute Company v. Asbury Park,\n316 U.S. 502, 509 (1942); cf. Salsburg v. Maryland, 346 U.S.\n454, 522-53 (1954). This principle suggests that while\ncourts should \"scrutiniz[e] schemes allegedly conceived or\noperated as purposeful devices to further racial discrimi-\nnation,\" Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 149 (1971), a\nfinding of discrimination should not be based on the kinds of\npresumptions used in intra-district cases, and, indeed, the\npresumptions should be in favor of the long-standing lines.\n- 15 -\n\nII. Remedy\nThe remedy invoked by the district court -- consoli-\ndating the three school divisions and assigning their stu-\ndents so as to achieve a different racial mix -- raises\nquestions similar to those discussed above. This is because\nin equity cases the Chancellor has traditionally followed\nthe rule that \"the nature of the violation determines the\nscope of the remedy.\" Swann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S.\n1, 16.\nTherefore, it is not sufficient for the district\ncourt to find that there has been some inter-district dis-\ncrimination. The court must also define precisely what the\nviolation is, and then tailor a remedy to fit the violation.\nThe broad brush applied by the court below makes it diffi-\ncult, on review, to say precisely what the violation, if any,\nwas. But the opinion of the court below suggests that in-\nstead of tailoring the remedy, the court used a blanket\napproach. Although the Swann decision may authorize such an\napproach in intra-system cases, it does not authorize it\nhere (see discussion pp. ti to 14, supra).\nIf the violation here is state-imposed segregation\nas between neighboring schools across school system lines\n- 16 -\n\n(see opinion, p. 242 ), desegregation as between those\nparticular schools might be warranted. If the violation\nis a denial of free access to housing in particular resi-\ndential areas (and therefore the schools which serve those\nareas), the court might require that the children be given\naccess to those schools; or it could join those responsible\nfor the housing discrimination and provide relief against\nthem. If there is proof of an inferior curriculum or the\nunfair allocation of money as among the systems, there may\nbe specific relief for those violations. See Serrano v.\nPriest, 5 Cal. 3d 584 (1971); Rodriguez v. San Antonio\nIndependent School District,(cid:9) F. Supp.(cid:9) , (W.D. Tex.,\n1971); Van Dusartz v. Hatfield, 334 F. Supp. 870 (D. Minn.,\n1971).\nIt is not clear here whether the district court's\nblanket relief stemmed from a view that Swann required such\nrelief or from the fact that this was the only relief sug-\ngested. Ordinarily, in desegregation cases where the issue\nof violation is presented, the district court holds a bi-\nfurcated hearing -- first it has a hearing as to violation;\nif it finds a violation it orders the development of plans\nand holds a hearing on the plans. Indeed, this is the pro-\ncedure being followed in the other inter-district metropolitan\n- 17 -\n\ncases cited by the district court at pages 77-81 of its\nopinion. Even the broad discretion authorized by Swann arises\nonly after the school authorities have defaulted by failing\nto propose an adequate plan. No such default has occurred\n9/\nhere; the district court found a violation and imposed a\nremedy simultaneously.\nIII. Conclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, we would suggest four\npossible courses of action by this Court:\n(a) Defer decision pending resolution of Keyes\nand of the legislative proposals now before Congress.\n(b) Scrutinize the district court's opinion and\nthe record in light of the considerations listed\nabove, and determine what if any, violation exists\nand what, if any, relief is warranted; enter an\norder of remand or reversal accordingly.\n(c) Set forth guidelines for analyzing whether\na violation exists and for deciding what, if any,\n9/ The district court apparently encouraged the defendants\nto prepare or participate in the preparation of plans. How-\never, since the violation(s) that could have been found varied\nconsiderably in scope, it was practically impossible for the\ndefendants to prepare plans tailored to remedy the alleged\nviolations in advance of the violation finding.\n- 18 -\n\nrelief is warranted; remand to the district\ncourt for application of these guidelines.\n(d) Find that the legal standards used by\nthe district court were erroneous and that\ntherefore the decision below should be re-\nversed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nBRIAN P.

School Board of City of Richmond, Virginia, 4 Cir., 317 F.2d 429. \n \n \n2  The resolution provides that school capacity may be a limiting factor. As a practical matter it has not been thus far. \n  That matter is discussed, infra. \n \n3  Two transfer applications made on September 6, 1963 were denied as tardy. They are mentioned below. \n \n \n4  The School Board’s resolutions, for instance, provide for denial of transfer applications when denial ‘is in the best \n  interest of the pupil.’ Such a provision, of course, could provide a means of discrimination, and the District Court \nordered that it not be applied in any case unless its purpose and effect were made definite and certain by an \namendment, and the amendment had been approved by the Court. The School Board’s resolutions also contain a \nlimiting qualification that the chosen school must be equipped to meet the pupil’s ‘program.’ This qualification the \nDistrict Court approved with the admonition that it should be employed only when the courses the pupil seeks are \nnot taught in the school he seeks to enter. Obviously, there is no discrimination involved if primary grade pupils are \nnot allowed to enter high schools or when pupils are required to remain within other program subdivisions based \nupon objective criteria unrelated to race and applied without discrimination. \n \n5  There was testimony by one of the school officials that the intention was to proceed as do the Baltimore schools \n  when a particular school reaches capacity; indeed, that the intention was to apply all of the Baltimore plan just as it \nis operated in Baltimore. Obviously, if the capacity limitation is so applied as to result in the denial of transfer \napplications of Negro pupils attending schools in which there are few or no white pupils upon the ground that all \nschools attended substantially by white pupils are over-capacity, there would be no ‘freedom of choice,’ as that \nterm has been employed in this context. Such freedom exists in a practical sense only when a pupil wishing to \nattend a school with substantial numbers of the other race has an unequivocal and realizable right to do so. If his \nfirst choice be unavailable, some other reasonable alternative must be available to him. \n \n  9 \n \n\n6  The District Court limited its approval of the plan prospectively, so that if and when the Board resorts to the capacity \n  limitation, its use of it must be approvable. \n \n7  Brown v.

Trial of those \nissues, depending on the evidence and the law, may or may not disclose further obligations on all parties. \nNevertheless,  it  having  been  represented  to  the  Court  by  the  defendant,  Richmond  School  Board,  that \nimplementation of at least one of the proposed plans would entail a minimum delay of 90 to 120 days, and for \nfurther reasons more fully enunciated in the balance of this memorandum, the Court addresses itself to the plan to \nbe adopted solely in the context referred to in the first paragraph of this memorandum. \n \n2  U.S. Supreme Court in granting writ of certiorari reinstated District Court’s judgment and ordered it to remain in \n  effect pending appellate proceedings. \n \n3  This conclusion is based upon what can be reasonably expected within the geographical boundaries from which the \n  students for whom the School Board now has responsibility come. \n \n4  It should be noted that the first three listed pairs each in fact constitute facilities located so close to one another \n  that it may be possible to operate them as single multi-building schools, at least administratively. At the hearing on \nMarch 4, Superintendent Adams proposed one modification from the plan theretofore offered, which change is not \nreflected in the zone descriptions and overlays. The Court considers the plan as thus altered. The two Mosby middle \nschool zones are joined by the addition to that school’s area of that portion of the Graves zone east of the \nChesapeake & Ohio Railway tracks. The Graves zone, in turn, is expanded northward, taking in all of the former \nMosby Zone 2 west of the railroad tracks to a point sufficient to add a number of students equivalent to those lost \nby severing the eastern end of the Graves zone. North of that point, students formerly placed in Mosby go instead \nto Chandler; about 89 are involved in this move, and there is adequate capacity in Chandler. About 327 students are \nshifted between Mosby and Graves and vice versa. Nearly all, if not all, are black. The racial makeup of all facilities \nremains substantially as forecast, and the changes are justified in the interests of ease of transportation. \n \n  26 \n \n\n \n5  For purposes of comparison, the Court notes that Dr. Foster estimated that if his desegregation plan were carried \n  out 45 further buses would be required (tr. 619, June 22, 1970). He considered the 63 buses used by the Board in \nthe annexed area to be available for use throughout the system, as well as eight other Board-owned buses, but he \nalso did not take into account, apparently, the possible use of VTC facilities for busing across the James or to \nnoncontiguously paired schools. VTC transports 8000-8500 under the interim plan. Dr. Foster estimated that his plan \nwould necessitate the busing of 9431 elementary pupils to noncontiguously paired schools and 2900 high school and \n2950 middle school students across the James River. \nAt the August, 1970, hearing, Dr. Little, Associate Superintendent, estimated that in order to desegregate the 19 \nschools left with enrollments of 90% Or more once race under the interim plan, transportation of 8260 further \nelementary pupils would be required. Under the interim plan itself, he estimated that the 15,903 children living \nbeyond one mile of school would need some form of transportation, and half would secure it by private means. \nThus 7951 would ride VTC buses. 5000 more would be bused in the annexed area. To carry the 8260 elementary \nstudents, Dr. Little estimated 140 buses would be needed. \nMr. Church of VTC testified at the same hearing that his company had the capacity thought necessary to execute the \ninterim plan, but that it would be impossible for it to serve another 4000 to 5000 students. \n \n5a  Figures giving the number of daily bus trips under various plans illustrate the effort and investment necessary. \n  Because, however, about half of the pupils in the annexed area (some 2,961 elementary pupils and an undisclosed \nnumber of secondary pupils) are carried from home to school in the annexed area and thereafter across town to the \nassigned school, the number of persons transported daily under plan 3 is less than 23,916. A fair estimate of the \nactual number carried is 20,535: \nPupils on VTC buses:  8,500 \n   \nNew secondary busing:  1,385 \n   \nNew elementary busing:  7,269 \n   \nAnnexed area busing    \n \n \nhome to school only (half    \n \n \nof 5,385 plus 1,377)  3,381 \n   \n   20,535 \n \n \n6   Bradley v. School Board of City of Richmond, supra, 317 F.Supp., pp. 569-572; see also, p. 650 of Vol. 3 of transcript \n  27 \n \n\n \n  of hearing held June 22, 1970. In 1968-69 the statewide average per bus was 62 minutes from beginning of run to \nschool. The average miles per bus per day was in excess of 40 and ranged from 18 to 90 miles. \n \n7  Most of the foregoing findings in regard to the reasonableness of the contemplated transportation were covered in \n  the Court’s memorandum of August 17, 1970. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  28 \n ",

Although Virginia, with its smaller \ncities, has less of a problem than many other states, we do have serious imbalances which cause deep concern. In \nour larger metropolitan areas there are income deficiencies and a racial mix which result in serious educational \ndisadvantages. The injustice, as well as the potentially disastrous social consequences of this situation, have \nprompted action by government at all levels as well as the private segment of our communities. There is no longer \nany debate as to the need for vigorous action to right this educational imbalance.” \n \n14  Lucas, et al. v.

School Board of the City of Richmond, 317 F.2d 429 (4th Cir. 1963); \n  345 F.2d 310 (4th Cir. 1965), rev’d and remanded, 382 U.S. 103, 86 S.Ct. 224, 15 L.Ed.2d 187 (1965). After four years \nunder a consent decree, the subsequent litigation in the district court is found in Bradley v. School Board of the City \nof Richmond, 51 F.R.D. 139 (E.D.Va.1970); 317 F.Supp. 555 (E.D.Va.1970); 324 F. Supp. 396 (E.D.Va.1971); 324 \nF.Supp. 439 (E.D.Va.1971); 324 F.Supp. 456 (E. D.Va.1971); and 325 F.Supp. 828 (E.D. Va.1971). The opinion of the \ndistrict court which is the subject of this appeal is Bradley v. School Board of the City of Richmond, D.C., 338 F.Supp. \n67, (E.D. Va.1972), hereinafter referred to as Bradley. \n \n2  This is not a bussing case. That remedy, approved in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. \n  1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971), has been utilized in Richmond and is not challenged on appeal. \n \n3  “The term ‘viable racial mix’ was defined by Dr. Little as ‘It is a racial mix that is well enough established that it will \n  continue to prosper. It will be a desirable, reasonable mix for educational purposes. . . .”’ Bradley, at 186, n. 22. \n \n4  In apparently adopting Dr. Pettigrew’s viable racial mix theory, the district court rejected the testimony of another \n  expert that the idea of a viable racial mix in which blacks must be in the minority in order to have a good education \nis  a  racist  proposal.  Dr.  Hooker  thought  that  the  consolidation  of  schools  in  the  Richmond  area  would \n“disenfranchise” black residents by preventing them from achieving control of the school system and would in time \nbe resented by black citizens as paternalistic and patronizing. The position of one of the amici, the Congress of Racial \nEquality, is similar to that expressed by Dr. Hooker. \n \n5  The author of this opinion is not unsympathetic with the district judge’s having accepted the Pettigrew theory of \n  “viable racial mix.” In Brunson v. Board of Trustees of School District No. 1 of Clarendon County, South Carolina, 429 \nF.2d 820 (1970), I wrote favorably of such an approach because of my dismay that white fleeing had actually \noccurred and would unquestionably continue until there were neither black schools nor white schools, but just black \nschools only. But in that case there was an extreme preponderance of blacks not present in the Richmond school \n  14 \n \n\ndistrict. Even so, I acknowledge doubt about my approach in that case and an increasing respect for the viewpoint of \nJudges Sobeloff and Winter expressed in opposition. Brunson, supra at 823. \n \n6  The district court’s concern with viable racial mix has been partly alleviated by this annexation, which has now been \n  approved by this court. Holt v. City of Richmond, 459 F.2d 1093 (4th Cir. 1972). \n \n7  “There shall be appointed by the school board or boards of each school division, one division superintendent of \n  schools . . . .” Constitution of Virginia § 133 (1902). \n \n8  Under coercion of the district court, the School Board of Chesterfield County, on February 5, 1972, adopted a \n  resolution set out in part as Appendix A. \n \n9  Dr. Thomas C. Little, expert witness for plaintiff and associate superintendent of the Richmond schools, conceded \n  that: \nYou also reach a point, and I don’t know exactly what that point is, some 50, 60, 70 thousand students, whereby it \nbecomes unwieldy for certain types of operations, particularly your curriculum, your involvement and neighborhood \ninput into the operation of your schools. \n \n1  United States v. Scotland Neck City Board of Education, 442 F.2d 575 (4 Cir. 1971), cert. granted 404 U.S. 821, 92 \n  S.Ct. 47, 30 L.Ed.2d 49 (1971); Wright v. Council of the City of Emporia, 442 F.2d 570 (4 Cir. 1971), cert. granted 404 \nU.S. 820, 92 S.Ct. 56, 30 L.Ed.2d 48 (1971). A decision of the Supreme Court in these two cases may be announced \nthis term. While the district court attemped to distinguish these cases, the fact is that they are simply the obverse of \nthe same coin which is presented here. In each of Scotland Neck and Emporia, the effect of splitting the school \ndistrict was further to delay and hinder the achievement of what would otherwise have been a unitary system in the \noriginal district, although arguably there were noninvidious reasons for subdividing. Here, as I view the case, the \nquestion is one of consolidating school districts within the framework of state law in order to eradicate the effects of \npast discrimination and to achieve a unitary system. Logically it is impossible to sustain the former and not condemn \nthe converse. Were the case as simple as described in the opening paragraph of the majority opinion, I doubt that I \nwould dissent. \n \n2  Brown I and the principal subsequent decisions are: Brown v. Board of Education (Brown I), 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. \n  686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954); Brown v. Board of Education (Brown II), 349 U.S. 294, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955); \nGreen v. County School Bd. of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968); Swann v. \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971); Davis v. Board of School \nComm’rs. of Mobile County, 402 U.S. 33, 91 S.Ct. 1289, 28 L.Ed.2d 577 (1971). \n \n3  Prior to July 1, 1971, and at the time when plaintiffs first sought the relief which was ultimately granted, the Virginia \n  State Board of Education had the duty to establish appropriate school divisions and the power to create a division \nencompassing more than one political subdivision. In the latter regard, there was no requirement of local consent. \n  15 \n \n\nVa.Const. § 132, as amended (1902); Va.Code Ann. §§ 22-30, 22-100.1 (Repl. Vol.1969). Such a division would be \nadministered by a superintendent elected jointly by the school boards of the political subdivisions comprising the \nsingle school division. Va.Const. § 133, as amended (1902); Va.Code Ann. § 22-34 (Repl.Vol.1969). Alternatively, with \nthe consent of the State Board of Education, the school boards and governing bodies of the affected political \nsubdivisions, the local school boards could be abolished and a single division school board created. Va.Const. § 133, \nas amended (1902); Va.Code Ann. §§ 22-100.1 and 22-100.2 (Repl.Vol.1969). \nThe Virginia Constitution was revised in 1970, the revisions becoming effective July 1, 1971. A consolidation of \nschool districts of political subdivisions may now be effected only at the request (and with the consent) of the school \nboards and governing bodies of the affected political subdivisions. Va.Const. Art. VIII, § 5(a), as revised (1970); Va. \nCode Ann. § 22-30 (Cum.Supp.1971). With the exception of this present requirement of consent, it is correct to say \nthat under Virginia statutes enacted pursuant to both the former and the current State Constitutions, there were \nand are specific provisions governing (1) the composition, appointment and terms of members of a school board of \na division composed of two or more political subdivisions, (2) the qualifications and duties of the consolidated \ndivision board members, (3) the corporate status of such a board and its general powers. (4) the compensation of \nboard members, (5) the transfer of title to school property, (6) the State Board’s responsibility for promulgating \nrules and regulations for the financial plan of operation of the schools of the consolidated division, (7) the formula \nfor the allocation of operating costs, capital outlay, and incurring of indebtedness for school construction, (8) the \nfiscal agent for the consolidated division, and (9) the effective date for formation of the Board and its assumption of \nthe supervision and operation of all schools within the consolidated division. Va.Code Ann. §§ 22-100.3 to 22-100.11 \n(Cum.Supp.1971). It may be added that in all respects the order of the district court complied with the provisions of \nexisting state law, save only that of the requirement of consent of the school boards and governing bodies of all of \nthe affected political subdivisions. \n \n4  Brown II, 349 U.S. at 300, 75 S.Ct. at 756: \n \nIn fashioning and effectuating the decrees, the courts will be guided by equitable principles. Traditionally, equity has \nbeen characterized by a practical flexibility in shaping its remedies and by a facility for adjusting and reconciling \npublic and private needs. These cases call for the exercise of these traditional attributes of equity power. At stake is \nthe personal interest of the plaintiffs in admission to public schools as soon as practicable on a nondiscriminatory \nbasis. To effectuate this interest may call for elimination of a variety of obstacles in making the transition to school \nsystems operated in accordance with the constitutional principles set forth in our May 17, 1954, decision. Courts of \nequity may properly take into account the public interest in the elimination of such obstacles in a systematic and \neffective manner. But it should go without saying that the vitality of these constitutional principles cannot be \nallowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them. (footnotes eliminated) \n \n5  Swann, 402 U.S. at 15-16, 91 S.Ct. at 1276: \n \nOnce a right and a violation have been shown, the scope of a district court’s equitable powers to remedy past \nwrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies. \n_____ \n[A] school desegregation case does not differ fundamentally from other cases involving the framing of equitable \nremedies to repair the denial of a constitutional right. The task is to correct, by a balancing of the individual and \ncollective interests, the condition that offends the Constitution. \n \n  16 \n \n\n6  Holt v. City of Richmond, 459 F.2d 1093 (4 Cir. 1972). \n \n \n7  On August 17, 1970, the district court approved an “Interim Plan” for the operation of Richmond’s schools for the \n  1970-71 school year. Bradley v. School Bd. of City of Richmond, 317 F.Supp. 555, (E.D.Va.1970), 324 F.Supp. 456 \n(E.D. Va.1971). On April 5, 1971, the district court ordered the implementation of another plan, “Plan III,” for the \nschool year 1971-72. Bradley v. School Board of City of Richmond, 325 F.Supp. 828 (E.D.Va.1971). Following the \nimplementation of the Interim Plan, Richmond lost 3,250, or 16% of its projected white student enrollment. This loss \nwas more than three times the normal rate of attrition of white students. \nWith respect to Plan III, the majority stresses that the district court found that implementation would accomplish a \nunitary system in the City of Richmond. I would stress that the district court made this finding only on the express \nassumption that the city would operate as a single administrative unit for school purposes. Of course, that same \nassumption underlay Judge Sobeloff’s dissent in Brunson v. Board of Tr. of Sch. D. No. 1 of Clarendon Co., S.C., 429 \nF.2d 820, 823-827 (4 Cir. 1970), in which I joined and which the author of the majority opinion in the instant case \nbelatedly finds persuasive. \n \n8  While the percentage of black population in Henrico County for the 1970-71 school year was less than it was when \n  Brown I was decided, the 1970-71 figure of 8.8% did represent an increase over 1960-61 when the figure was 6.67%. \n \n9  See, in particular, Bradley v. School Bd. of City of Richmond, 317 F.2d 429 (4 Cir. 1963); Bradley v. School Bd. of City \n  of Richmond, 345 F.2d 310 (4 Cir. 1965), vacated and remanded 382 U.S. 103, 86 S.Ct. 224, 15 L.Ed.2d 187 (1965). \nSee also, the opinion of the district court in the instant case, 338 F.Supp. 67 (E.D.Va. 1972), and James v. Almond, \n170 F.Supp. 331 (E.D.Va.1959), appeal dismissed 359 U.S. 1006, 79 S.Ct. 1146, 3 L.Ed.2d 987 (1959); Adkins v. School \nBd. of New-port News, 148 F.Supp. 430 (E.D.Va.), aff’d. 246 F.2d 325 (4 Cir.), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 855, 78 S.Ct. 83, 2 \nL.Ed.2d 63 (1957). \n \n10  The relief granted by the district court in Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 317 F.2d 429 (4 Cir. 1963), was only to \n  order the admission of individual black plaintiffs to formerly all-white schools; an injunction running to the benefit \nof the entire class was denied. We reversed on the latter point. In the next appeal, Bradley v. School Bd. of City of \nRichmond, 345 F.2d 310 (4 Cir. 1965), we rejected a challenge to the freedom of choice desegregation plan and also \nheld that faculty desegregation would not be required. On the latter point, the Supreme Court reversed. 382 U.S. \n103, 86 S.Ct. 224, 15 L.Ed.2d 187 (1965). Finally, in March, 1966, a consent decree embodying freedom-of-choice \nand faculty desegregation was entered. \n \n11  Even before the decision in Swann, we held in Brewer v. School Bd. of Norfolk, 397 F.2d 37 (4 Cir. 1968), that the \n  obligation of state authorities to create a unitary system was not met by the adoption of attendance plans which \nmerely reproduced segregated housing patterns in the schools. No less may school construction sites be selected to \nserve only racially identifiable neighborhoods. \n \n12  Maryland Committee  etc. v. Tawes, 377 U.S. 656, 675, 84 S.Ct. 1429, 12 L.Ed.2d 595 (1964), and Lucas v. \n  Forty-fourth General Assembly of Colorado, 377 U.S. 713, 738, 84 S.Ct. 1459, 12 L.Ed.2d 632 (1964), go far to \nestablish that where the equal protection clause is at issue history and tradition will not save existing political and \n  17 \n \n\nsubdivision boundaries. \n \n13  The amicus brief of American Civil Liberties Union and American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia convincingly \n  describes the evaluation of the cultural and economic ties in the combined area of Richmond, Henrico and \nChesterfield Counties through the eyes of their school population when it states: \nGiven the factual context of this case, a child attending any Metropolitan Richmond school knows whether his \nschool is a white one or a black one. He probably lives within a half hour of the center of the city. Either his parents \nor his neighbor’s parents work within the city limits. No matter where he lives in the metropolitan area, the child will \ngo to the hospital in the center of the city if he is ill, and his parents are likely to go into the city center for \nentertainment. There are no definite natural geographical boundary lines which divide up the city, and the political \nlines constantly shift with each new annexation. The only clear physical demarcation between various parts of the \nmetropolitan area is that people living near the center of the city are predominantly black and people living further \naway are predominantly white; or, to put it in terms of the child’s perspective–people living near the center attend \n“black” schools, and people living further away attend “white” schools. \n \n14  U.S.Constitution, Art. 14, § 1: \n \nNo State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United \nStates; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to \nany person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. (emphasis added) See, Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 \nU.S. 1, 68 S.Ct. 836, 92 L.Ed. 1161 (1948); Truax v. Corrigan, 257 U.S. 312, 42 S.Ct. 124, 66 L.Ed. 254 (1921); Civil \nRights Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 3 S.Ct. 18, 27 L.Ed. 835 (1883). \n \n15  Avery v. Midland County, 390 U.S. 474, 88 S.Ct. 1114, 20 L.Ed.2d 45 (1968); Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1, 64 S.Ct. \n  397, 88 L.Ed. 497 reh. denied, 321 U.S. 804, 64 S.Ct. 778, 88 L.Ed. 1090 (1944). See also, United States v. Guest, 383 \nU.S. 745, 86 S.Ct. 1170, 16 L.Ed.2d 239 (1966). \n \n16  The consolidated district ordered by the district court would encompass 752 square miles and 104,000 pupils. \n  Virginia has six other existing school districts encompassing more than 700 square miles (Bedford, Pittsylvania \nCounty,  Albemarle  County,  Halifax,  Rockingham  County  and  Augusta  County.)  Fairfax  County  School  District \npresently enrolls 135,948 students. \nIt is significant also that since 1944 it has been the policy of the Virginia State Board of Education to encourage the \nconsolidation of school districts. Then, it was proposed to create 50-60 school districts to replace the existing 110 \ndivisions.  This  policy  was  abandoned,  effective  July  1,  1971,  when  the  State  Board  of  Education  required \ndeconsolidation of all school divisions comprising more than one political subdivision. Such action was taken \npursuant to legislative direction enacted while the present phase of the instant case was pending before the district \ncourt. \n \n \n \n \n  18 \n ",

His case became moot. \n  6 \n \n\n \n2  Raised below (but not involved in this appeal) was the issue as to the joinder of the Richmond School Board and \n  Superintendent of Schools as parties defendant. Correctly, we think, the District Court held: \n‘* * * The State Pupil Placement Board has authority over the placement of pupils, and the local officials refrain from \nmaking recommendations to the Board, but approximately 98 per cent of the placements are made routinely as a \nresult of the regulations of the School Board pertaining to attendance areas. The evidence shows that the State \nPupil Placement Board has no inclination to vary these attendance areas, although undoubtedly it has authority to \ndo so. In view of this situation, the School Board and the Superintendent of Schools are proper parties.’ \n \n3  On September 2, 1958, a suit styled Lorna Renee Warden et al. v. The School Board of the City of Richmond, Virginia, \n  et al. was instituted in the District Court, praying, inter alia, that a permanent injunction be entered restraining the \nRichmond School Board and its division Superintendent of Schools from any and all actions that regulate or affect, \non the basis of race or color, the admission, enrollment or education of the infant plaintiffs, or any other Negro child \nsimilarly situated, to and in any public school operated by the defendants. \nThat suit was decided on July 5, 1961. The District Court ordered that the then one remaining Negro plaintiff be \ntransferred from the Negro school located five miles from her home and admitted to the white school in her \nneighborhood. However, the court denied class relief, stating: ‘There is no question as to the right of the infant \nplaintiff to be admitted to the schools of the City of Richmond without discrimination on the ground of race. She is \nadmitted, however, as an individual, not as a class or group; and it is as an individual that her rights under the \nConstitution are asserted.’ \nThe court refused to grant a permanent injunction and dismissed the case from the docket. \n \n4  The case to which the District Court referred is styled Green v. School Board of City of Roanoke, Virginia, and is now \n  reported in 304 F.2d 118. \n \n5  In its written opinion the District Court stated as follows: \n \n‘The plaintiffs prayed that the defendants be enjoined from continuing discrimination in the city schools and that \nthe School Board be required to submit a desegregation plan. The Court has weighed all of the factors presented by \nthe evidence in this case and finds that the defendants have taken measures to eliminate racially discriminatory \nenrollments in the first grade. Apparently they are eliminating discriminatory enrollments in George Wythe High \nSchool (white) and they are routinely assigning Negro students in white junior high schools to white high schools. \n‘While the School Board has not presented a formal plan of desegregation, the Court finds that the defendants have \nmade a reasonable start toward a nondiscriminatory school system resulting in the attendance of 127 Negro \nstudents in white schools for the 1962-1963 school term. In view of the steps that have been taken in this direction, \nthe Court concludes that the defendants should be allowed discretion to fashion within a reasonable time the \nchanges necessary to eliminate the remaining objectionable features of the system of ‘feeder schools’. \n‘In Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 300 (75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083) (1955), the Supreme Court stated \n‘Traditionally, equity has been characterized by a practical flexibility in shaping its remedies and by a facility for \nadjusting and reconciling public and private needs.’ The Court is of the opinion that the relief decreed in this case is \nsufficient at this time in view of the evidence presented. The refusal of broad injunctive relief now is not to be \nconstrued as approval to continue the ‘feeder school system’ as it is now operated. See Hill v. School Board of the \n  7 \n \n\nCity of Norfolk, Virginia, 282 F.2d 473 (4th Cir. 1960); Dodson v.
