    "summary": "<p>On June 2, 2014, a private individual filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The plaintiff sued the National Security Agency under the Declaratory Judgment Act and FISA Title V. The plaintiff alleged violations of his First and Fourth Amendment rights and requested declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that both metadata and content of his Gmail, Facebook, and Dropbox accounts were compromised under the PRISM program as revealed in the documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden to <i>The Guardian</i> in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data\">an article published on June 6, 2013</a>.</p><p>On December 11, 2014, the NSA filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction and the plaintiff failed in any event to state claims on which relief may be granted. On January 7, 2015, the plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction with the District Court, requesting that the court bar the NSA from continuing to collect the plaintiff's metadata and content, direct the NSA to destroy the plaintiff's data, and prohibit the NSA from querying the data currently in its possession. On January 8, 2015, Judge Cathy Bisson denied the plaintiff's motion because of the plaintiff's inability to establish sufficient imminent and irreparable harm.  </p><p>The District Court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss on September 30, 2015. 2015 WL 5732117. The plaintiff appealed the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The Third Circuit vacated and remanded the case on October 5, 2016, finding that the injuries allegedly sustained by the plaintiff were sufficiently personal to support standing, and that his claim was sufficiently plausible to proceed. <i>Schuchardt v. President of the United States</i>, 839 F.3d 366 (3d Cir. 2016). </p><p>A private third party moved to intervene in the case on December 13, 2016, and Judge Bisson denied his motion as frivolous on December 27. The third party appealed on January 27, 2017. The Third Circuit dismissed the appeal for failure to pay the filing fee on February 23, 2017. </p><p>On March 15, 2017, the defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss. The case was administratively closed from March 16, 2017 through July 6, 2017, on the grounds that plaintiff was given an extended amount of time to respond to the motion to dismiss. The plaintiff filed their opposition on July 10. The defendants filed their reply on August 16, 2017. </p><p>During this time, The Third Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the appeal of the third party to be reopened, and then dismissed the third party's case on September 6, 2017 for failure to pay the filing fee for the notice of appeal.</p><p>On February 4, 2019, the court granted the defendant's renewed motion to dismiss, noting that “they have shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the government did not engage in dragnet-type collection activity . . . thereby establishing a plausible claim that Plaintiff’s data was captured.” 2019 WL 426482. The plaintiffs appealed to the Third Circuit on February 12, and the Third Circuit affirmed on March 2, 2020. 802 F. App'x 69. The case is now closed. </p>",

Brooks  Smith,  United  States  Circuit \nJudge for the Third Circuit, assumed Chief Judge status on \nOctober 1, 2016.  \n2 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 3      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\n____________ \n \nOPINION \n____________ \n \nHARDIMAN, Circuit Judge. \nThis appeal involves a constitutional challenge to an \nelectronic  surveillance  program  operated  by  the  National \nSecurity Agency (NSA) under the authority of Section 702 of \nthe  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Act  (FISA).  Elliott \nSchuchardt  appeals  an  order  of  the  United  States  District \nCourt for the Western District of Pennsylvania dismissing his \ncivil action for lack of jurisdiction. The District Court held \nthat Schuchardt lacked standing to sue because he failed to \nplead facts from which one might reasonably infer that his \nown  communications  had  been  seized  by  the  federal \ngovernment. Because we hold that, at least as a facial matter, \nSchuchardt’s second amended complaint plausibly stated an \ninjury in fact personal to him, we will vacate  the District \nCourt’s order and remand.  \n  I \nSchuchardt’s  appeal  is  the  latest  in  a  line  of  cases \nraising  the  question  of  a  plaintiff’s  standing  to  challenge \nsurveillance authorized by Section 702. Congress amended \nFISA in 2008 to “supplement[] pre-existing FISA authority \nby creating a new framework under which the Government \nmay . . .  target[]  the  communications  of  non-U.S.  persons \nlocated abroad.” Clapper v. Amnesty International USA, 133 \nS. Ct. 1138, 1144 (2013); see also FISA Amendments Act of \n2008, Pub. L. No. 110–261, 122 Stat. 2436, 2438, 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1881a.  On  the  day  Section  702  became  law,  its \n3 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 4      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nconstitutionality  was  challenged  by  “attorneys  and  human \nrights,  labor,  legal,  and  media  organizations  whose  work \nallegedly require[d] them to engage in . . . telephone and e-\nmail  communications”  with  persons  located  outside  the \nUnited States. See id. at 1145. The Clapper plaintiffs claimed \nthat  Section  702  was  facially  unconstitutional  under  the \nFourth Amendment,  which prohibits unreasonable searches \nand seizures. See id. at 1146. \nA \nThe  dispositive  question  presented  to  the  Supreme \nCourt in Clapper was whether the plaintiffs had established \nan “imminent” injury “fairly traceable” to the government’s \nconduct under Section 702. See 133 S. Ct. at 1147. Because \nthe plaintiffs had brought suit on the day the law was enacted, \nthere was no evidence that their communications had been \nintercepted—there  was  only  a  looming  “threat  of  [future] \nsurveillance.”  Id.  at  1145–46.  Nonetheless,  the  plaintiffs \nclaimed they had standing because there was an “objectively \nreasonable likelihood” that their communications would be \nintercepted based on the nature of their contacts with persons \noutside of the country. Id at 1146. \nThe  Supreme  Court  rejected  this  argument  as \n“inconsistent”  with  longstanding  precedent  requiring  that \n“threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute \ninjury  in  fact,”  Clapper,  133  S.  Ct.  at  1147  (emphasis  in \noriginal) (quoting Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S 149, 158 \n(1990)).  And  because  the  plaintiffs  could  rely  only  on  a \n“speculative chain of possibilities” to support their allegations \nof future harm from unlawful government surveillance, they \nfailed  to  demonstrate  an  injury  that  was  “certainly \nimpending.” Id. at 1150.  \n4 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 5      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nIn  particular,  the  Court  characterized  the  Clapper \nplaintiffs’  “speculative  chain”  as  entailing  five  inferential \nleaps: \n(1)  the  Government  will  decide  to  target  the \ncommunications  of  non-U.S.  persons  with \nwhom [the plaintiffs] communicate; \n(2) in doing so, the Government will choose to \ninvoke its authority under [Section 702] rather \nthan . . . another method of surveillance; \n(3)  the  Article  III  judges  who  serve  on  the \nForeign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court  will \nconclude  that  the  Government’s  proposed \nsurveillance  procedures . . .  satisfy  [Section \n702’s] many safeguards and are consistent with \nthe Fourth Amendment; \n(4) the Government will succeed in intercepting \nthe communications of [the plaintiffs’] contacts; \nand  \n(5)  [the  plaintiffs]  will  be  parties  to  the \nparticular communications that the Government \nintercepts. \n133 S. Ct. at 1148.  \n  On summary judgment, the plaintiffs had failed to “set \nforth by affidavit or other evidence specific facts” supporting \nthese  inferences.  Id.  at  1149  (internal  quotation  marks \nomitted). Accordingly, they lacked standing to challenge the \nconstitutionality of Section 702. Id. \n5 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 6      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nB \nSoon  after  Clapper  was  decided,  former  NSA \ncontractor  Edward  Snowden  leaked  a  trove  of  classified \ndocuments to journalists writing for the Washington Post and \nGuardian.1 Those documents referenced the existence of an \nNSA  program  engaged  in  the  bulk  collection  of  domestic \ntelephone  metadata,  i.e.,  “details  about  telephone  calls, \nincluding for example, the length of a call, the phone number \nfrom which the call was made, and the phone number called,” \nbut not the voice content of the call itself. ACLU v. Clapper, \n785 F.3d 787, 793 (2d Cir. 2015); see also Smith v. Obama, \n816 F.3d 1239, 1241 (9th Cir. 2016); Obama v. Klayman, 800 \nF.3d 559, 561 (D.C. Cir. 2015). The operational parameters of \nthe program  were  summarized in a classified order  of the \nForeign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court  (FISC)  directed  at \nVerizon Business Network Services. ACLU, 785 F.3d at 795. \nIn short, based on Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, \nPub. L. No. 107–56, 115 Stat. 272, 287 (2001) (codified as \namended at 50 U.S.C. § 1861 et seq.), Verizon was producing \nto  the  government,  “all  call  detail  records or  ‘telephony \nmetadata’ . . . on all telephone calls made through its systems \nor using its services where one or both ends of the call are \nlocated in the United States.” ACLU, 785 F.3d at 795.  \n                                                 \n1 See, e.g., Ellen Nakashima,  Verizon Providing All \nCall Records to U.S. Under Court Order, Wash. Post (June 6, \n2013),  https://perma.cc/LZK7-37CJ;  see  also  Glenn \nGreenwald,  NSA  Collecting  Phone  Records  of  Millions  of \nVerizon  Customers  Daily,  Guardian  (June  6,  2013), \nhttps://perma.cc/UR2A-492H. \n6 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 7      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nThe  government’s  bulk  collection  of  telephone \nmetadata precipitated a number of lawsuits. In one case, the \nSecond  Circuit  held that the  government had  exceeded its \nstatutory  authority  under  Section  215  to  obtain  “relevant” \ninformation by constructing an “all-encompassing” database \nof  “every  telephone  call  made  or  received  in  the  United \nStates.”  ACLU,  785  F.3d  at  812–13.  Under  the  statute’s \nsunset  provision,  however,  authorization  for  the  bulk \ntelephone  metadata  collection  program  expired  on  June  1, \n2015.  See  Pub.  L.  No.  112–14,  125  Stat.  216  (2011) \n(authorizing  an  extension);  Smith,  816  F.3d  at  1241.  And \nalthough the program was subsequently reauthorized by the \nUSA FREEDOM Act, Pub. L. No. 114–23, 129 Stat. 268 \n(2015), that act “prohibits any further bulk collection.” Smith, \n816 F.3d at 1241. In reliance on that prohibition, the Ninth \nCircuit has determined that “claims related to the ongoing \ncollection of metadata [under Section 215] are [now] moot.” \nId. \nSeparate  and  apart  from  the  bulk  collection  of \ntelephone metadata under Section 215, the documents leaked \nto the Washington Post and Guardian also shed light on a \npreviously  undisclosed  electronic  surveillance  program \noperating under Section 702 called PRISM.2 Slides from a \npresentation  purportedly  authored  by  the  NSA  described \n                                                 \n2  See,  e.g.,  Barton  Gellman  &  Laura  Poitras,  U.S. \nBritish  Intelligence  Mining  Data  from  Nine  U.S.  Internet \nCompanies in Broad Secret Program, Wash. Post (June 7, \n2013),  https://perma.cc/YJU2-U9TZ;  Glenn  Greenwald  & \nEwan MacAskill, NSA Prism Program Taps in to User Data \nof  Apple,  Google  and  Others,  Guardian  (June  7,  2013), \nhttps://perma.cc/RPA9-RXSY \n7 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 8      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nPRISM  as  “collect[ing]  directly  from  the  servers”  the  full \ncontent  of  user  communications  exchanged  using  services \nprovided  by  several  large  U.S.  companies—including \nMicrosoft, Google, Yahoo, Apple, and Facebook. App. 53. \nAnother slide depicted a timeline showing the inception of \nPRISM  collection  from  each  company,  beginning  with \nMicrosoft  in  September  2007  and  ending  with  Apple  in \nOctober 2012. Yet another slide suggested a slogan for the \nNSA’s “New Collection Posture”: “Sniff it All, Know it All, \nCollect it All, Process it All, Exploit it All, and Partner it \nAll.” App. 61.  \nII \nOn June 2, 2014, Schuchardt filed a complaint in the \nDistrict Court asserting constitutional, statutory, and state law \nclaims  against  the  President,  the  Director  of  National \nIntelligence,  and  the  Directors  of  the  NSA  and  Federal \nBureau of Investigation. He alleged that the Government was \nviolating the Fourth Amendment by storing his confidential \ncommunications  “in  a  computer  database,  or  through  a \ngovernment  program,  which  the  Defendants  call  ‘Prism.’” \nCivil  Complaint ¶ 22, Schuchardt v. Obama, No. 2-14-cv-\n00705-CB (W.D. Pa. June 2, 2014), ECF No. 1. He sought to \nenjoin  “the  [Government]  from  engaging  in  any  further \ncollection of . . . [his] information.” Id. ¶ 37. \nSchuchardt responded to the Government’s successive \nmotions  to  dismiss  by  amending  his  complaint  twice.  In \naddition to refining and expanding his allegations, Schuchardt \nsupplemented  his  averments  with  exhibits,  the  contents  of \nwhich fall into two general categories. First, he supported his \nallegations regarding PRISM with excerpts of the classified \nmaterials  that  were  the  focus  of  the  Washington  Post  and \n8 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 9      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nGuardian reports, as well as several of the reports themselves. \nSecond, he included affidavits filed in support of the plaintiffs \nin Jewel v. NSA (Jewel I), 965 F. Supp. 2d 1090 (N.D. Cal. \n2013), a case challenging the NSA’s interception of internet \ntraffic flowing through a telecommunications facility in San \nFrancisco pursuant to an Executive Order issued shortly after \nSeptember 11, 2001.  Id. at 1098.  Jewel I  was decided on \nremand from Jewel v. NSA, 673 F.3d 902 (9th Cir. 2011), in \nwhich the Ninth Circuit held that the plaintiffs had adequately \npleaded Article III standing to sue. See 673 F.3d at 913. The \naffidavits in Jewel I were filed by former NSA employees \nwho  asserted  that  the  agency  had,  since  September  11, \ndeveloped  an  expansive  view  of  its  own  surveillance \nauthority and the technology to back it up. See, e.g., App. 126 \n(“The  post-September  11  approach  was  that  NSA  could \ncircumvent federal statutes and the Constitution as long as \nthere was some visceral connection to looking for terrorists. . \n.  .  [The  NSA]  has,  or  is  in  the  process  of  obtaining,  the \ncapability to seize and store most electronic communications \npassing through its U.S. intercept centers.”).3  \n                                                 \n3  Schuchardt’s  second  amended  complaint  also \nasserted:  a  Fourth  Amendment  claim  challenging  the  bulk \ncollection of telephone metadata under Section 215, App. 99 \n(Count II); a Pennsylvania state-law claim, App. 100 (Count \nIII),  and a First  Amendment claim, App.  101 (Count IV), \nchallenging  both  PRISM  and  the  telephone  metadata \nprogram; and statutory claims under FISA seeking injunctive \nrelief, App. 103 (Count V), and damages, App. 104 (Count \nVI). At oral argument, Schuchardt belatedly conceded that his \nclaims regarding the bulk collection of telephone metadata \nwere mooted by the USA FREEDOM Act. See Transcript of \nOral Argument at 5, Schuchardt v. Obama, No. 15-3491 (3d \n9 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 10      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nBased on  the  record  he had compiled, Schuchardt’s \nsecond  amended  complaint  alleged  that  because  the \nGovernment  was  “intercepting,  monitoring  and  storing  the \ncontent  of  all  or  substantially  all  of  the  e-mail  sent  by \nAmerican citizens,” his own online communications had been \nseized in the dragnet. App. 82, 95–99 (emphasis added). In \nparticular, Schuchardt asserted that he was “a consumer of \nvarious  types  of  electronic  communication,  storage,  and \ninternet services,” including “the e-mail services provided by \nGoogle and Yahoo; the internet search services of Google; the \ncloud  storage  services  provided  by  Google  and  Dropbox; \n[and] the e-mail and instant message services provided by \nFacebook.”  App.  95–96.  Then,  relying  on  the  operational \ndetails of PRISM made public by the Washington Post and \nGuardian, he alleged that: (1) the Government “had obtained \ndirect access to the servers” of the companies providing him \nwith  these  services;  (2)  the  Government  was  “unlawfully \nintercepting,  accessing,  monitoring  and/or  storing  [his] \nprivate  communications  .  .  .  made  or  stored  through  such \nservices”;  and  (3)  the  Government  was  “collecting  such \ninformation  in  order  to  ‘data  mine’  the  nation’s  e-mail \ndatabase.” App. 84, 95–97.  \n                                                                                                             \nCir.  May  17,  2016).  He  also  agreed  that  his  claim  for \nmonetary damages under FISA was barred by the doctrine of \nsovereign immunity, and that he was no longer pursuing his \nclaims under the First Amendment. Id. at 10–11. In light of \nSchuchardt’s concessions, we do not address these issues, and \nfocus solely on whether he has standing to litigate his Fourth \nAmendment  claim  for  injunctive  relief  based  on  the \nGovernment’s  alleged  bulk  collection  of  online \ncommunications under PRISM, App. 95 (Count I). \n10 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 11      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nIn its motion to dismiss Schuchardt’s second amended \ncomplaint,  the  Government  principally  took  issue  with  his \nallegation that the “NSA collects the online communications . \n. . of all Americans, including, therefore, his.” See Brief in \nSupport of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Second \nAmended Complaint at 2, Schuchardt v. Obama, No. 2-14-\ncv-00705-CB  (W.D.  Pa.  Dec.  11,  2014),  ECF  No.  21 \n(emphasis added). Specifically, the Government argued that \nbecause Section 702 authorizes the targeted surveillance of \nonly persons outside the United States, it was implausible that \nPRISM—a program operating under the authority of Section \n702—was  a  dragnet  capturing  all  the  country’s  domestic \nonline  communications.  In  support  of  its  position,  the \nGovernment cited a report on PRISM prepared by the Privacy \nand  Civil  Liberties  Oversight  Board  (PCLOB),4  an \nindependent  agency  tasked  with  “review[ing]  actions  the \nexecutive branch takes to protect the Nation from terrorism, \nensuring that the need for such actions is balanced with the \nneed  to  protect  privacy  and  civil  liberties.”  42  U.S.C. \n§ 2000ee(c)(1). Based on its review, the PCLOB determined \nthat  “[i]n  PRISM  collection,  the  government . . .  sends \nselectors—such  as  an  email  address—to  a  United  States-\nbased electronic communications service provider,” who is \nthen by law “compelled to give the communications sent to or \nfrom that selector to the government.” PCLOB Report at 33. \nFar  from  being  the  dragnet  that  Schuchardt  had  alleged, \n                                                 \n4 Privacy & Civil Liberties Oversight Board, Report on \nthe Surveillance Program Operated Pursuant to Section 702 \nof the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (July 2, 2014), \navailable  at  https://www.pclob.gov/library/702-Report.pdf \n[hereinafter PCLOB Report]. \n11 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 12      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\ntherefore,  “PRISM  collection  under  Section  702  may  be \ntargeted only at non-U.S. persons located abroad who possess \nor  are  likely  to  receive  foreign-intelligence  information.” \nBrief in Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss at 10, \nSchuchardt  v.  Obama,  No.  2-14-cv-00705-CB  (W.D.  Pa. \nAug. 11, 2014), ECF No. 8. Because none of Schuchardt’s \nallegations  suggested  that  he  or  his  associates  would  be \ntargeted as such persons, the Government argued that he had \nfailed  to  include  “well-pleaded  allegations  and  non-\nconclusory  allegations  of  fact”  necessary  to  establish  his \nstanding. Brief in Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint at 4, Schuchardt v. \nObama, No. 2-14-cv-00705-CB (W.D. Pa. Dec. 11, 2014), \nECF No. 21. \nThe District Court granted the Government’s motion to \ndismiss Schuchardt’s second amended complaint, but took a \nslightly  different  tack  than  what  the  Government  had \nsuggested.  After  considering  four  cases  examining \nconstitutional standing to sue in cases challenging national \nsecurity  surveillance—Clapper,  ACLU,  Jewel,  and \nKlayman—the Court deduced a “meaningful distinction” that \nexplained  their divergent outcomes.  Schuchardt v.  Obama, \n2015  WL  5732117,  at  *6  (W.D.  Pa.  Sept.  30,  2015).  “In \nsituations where plaintiffs are able to allege with some degree \nof  particularity  that  their  own  communications  were \nspecifically targeted—for example by citing a leaked FISC \norder or relying on a detailed insider account—courts have \nconcluded  that  the  particularity  requirement  has  been \nsatisfied.” Id. “On the other hand, courts have refused to find \nstanding  based  on  naked  averments  that  an  individual’s \ncommunications  must  have  been  seized  because  the \ngovernment  operates  a  data  collection  program  and  the \n12 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 13      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nindividual utilized the service of a large telecommunications \ncompany.” Id.  \nApplying the pleading standard it had gleaned from \nClapper,  ACLU,  Jewel,  and  Klayman,  the  District  Court \nbegan  by  noting  that  the  facts  underpinning  Schuchardt’s \nallegations were drawn almost entirely from “media reports \nand  publicly  available  information.”  Id.  Accordingly,  his \nlawsuit fell “squarely within the second category” of cases, \ni.e.,  those  brought  by  plaintiffs  who  lacked  Article  III \nstanding. Id. Furthermore, Schuchardt “had identified no facts \nfrom which the Court reasonably might infer that his own \ncommunications have been targeted, seized, or stored.” Id. As \nsuch, he was “indistinguishable from every other American \nsubscribing  to  the  services  of  a  major  telephone  and/or \ninternet  service  provider.”  Id.  His  “only  discernible \ndistinction  [was]  his  heightened  personal-interest  in  the \nsubject,”  which  was  “insufficient  to  confer  standing.”  Id. \n(citing Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 \nU.S. 208, 220 (1974)). \nIII \nThe District Court had jurisdiction over Schuchardt’s \nclaims under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, as well as the inherent power \nto  ascertain  its  own  jurisdiction.  See  Arbaugh  v.  Y.  &  H. \nCorp., 546 U.S. 500, 514 (2006). We have jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. § 1291. See also Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch. \nDist., 475 U.S. 534, 541–42 (1986). We review de novo the \nDistrict  Court’s  order  dismissing  Schuchardt’s  second \namended complaint. See Fleisher v. Standard Ins. Co., 679 \nF.3d 116, 120 (3d Cir. 2012).  \n13 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 14      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nAt  the  outset,  we  note  that  there  is  an  important \ndistinction between “facial” and “factual” attacks on subject \nmatter jurisdiction raised in a motion under Rule 12(b)(1) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Mortensen v. First \nFed. Sav. & Loan, 549 F.2d 884, 891 (3d Cir. 1977). In a \nfacial attack, we review only “the allegations of the complaint \nand documents referenced therein and attached thereto, in the \nlight most favorable to the plaintiff.” Gould Elecs. v. United \nStates, 220 F.3d 169, 176 (3d Cir. 2000). If, however, the \ndefendant contests the pleaded jurisdictional facts, “the court \nmust permit the plaintiff to respond with evidence supporting \njurisdiction.” Id. at 177 (citing Int’l Ass’n of Machinists & \nAerospace Workers v. Nw. Airlines, Inc., 673 F.2d 700, 711–\n12  (3d  Cir.  1982)).  “The  court  may  then  determine \njurisdiction  by  weighing  the  evidence  presented  by  the \nparties,” but “if there is a dispute of a material fact, the court \nmust conduct a plenary trial on the contested facts prior to \nmaking a jurisdictional determination.” Id.  \nIt is clear from the record in this case that the District \nCourt viewed the Government’s motion to dismiss as a facial \nattack on its jurisdiction. The Court’s analysis focused solely \non  Schuchardt’s  second  amended  complaint;  it  did  not \nconsider  any  extrinsic  facts  proffered  by  the  Government, \nincluding, for example, the nature of PRISM collection as \ndetermined  by  the  PCLOB.  See  Schuchardt,  2015  WL \n5732117, at *5–7.  Accordingly,  our review of the District \nCourt’s order will accept as true all of Schuchardt’s plausible \nallegations, and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.5  \n                                                 \n5 Schuchardt has also challenged on appeal the District \nCourt’s  order  denying  his  request  for  a  preliminary \ninjunction,  a  decision  the  Court  rendered  more  than  six \n14 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 15      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nIV \nWe  begin  our  analysis  with  first  principles.  As  a \nplaintiff  seeking  to  invoke  federal  jurisdiction,  Schuchardt \nbears the burden of establishing each element of his standing \nto sue under Article III. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, \n504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). “[T]he irreducible constitutional \nminimum of standing contains three elements.” Id. at 560. \nFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an injury \nin  fact—an  invasion  of  a  legally  protected \ninterest which is (a) concrete and particularized, \nand (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or \nhypothetical. Second,  there  must  be  a  causal \nconnection between the injury and the conduct \ncomplained  of—the  injury  has  to  be  fairly \ntraceable  to  the  challenged  action  of  the \ndefendant, and not the result of the independent \naction of some third party not before the court. \nThird, it must be likely, as opposed to merely \nspeculative, that the injury will be redressed by \na favorable decision.  \nId.  at  560–61  (internal  quotation  marks,  citations,  and \nalterations omitted).  \n                                                                                                             \nmonths before granting the Government’s motion to dismiss. \nBecause Schuchardt failed to identify that unrelated order in \nhis notice of appeal, however, we lack jurisdiction to consider \nhis arguments. See Sulima v. Tobyhanna Army Depot, 602 \nF.3d 177, 184 (3d Cir. 2010). \n15 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 16      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nBecause a motion to dismiss raising a facial attack on \nsubject matter jurisdiction relies solely on the pleadings, “we \napply the same standard of review we use when assessing a \nmotion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.” See Finkelman \nv. NFL, 810 F.3d 187, 194 (3d Cir. 2016). “Thus, to survive a \nmotion to dismiss for lack of standing, a plaintiff must allege \nfacts  that  affirmatively  and  plausibly  suggest  that  [he] \nhas standing to sue.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). \nThat is, the plaintiff must “plausibly allege facts establishing \neach constitutional requirement.” Hassan v. City of New York, \n804 F.3d 277, 289 (3d Cir. 2015); see also Spokeo, Inc. v. \nRobins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016).  \nAgainst this doctrinal backdrop, Schuchardt’s Article \nIII standing turns on two inquiries. First, were his allegations \nsufficiently “particularized” to demonstrate that he suffered a \ndiscrete injury? See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560. Second, were \nthose  facts  pleaded  with  enough  detail  to  render  them \nplausible,  “well-pleaded”  allegations  entitled  to  a \npresumption of truth? See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, \n681 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 554 \n(2007). We address each inquiry in turn. \nA \nA  “particularized”  Article  III  injury  is  one  that \n“affect[s] the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.” In re \nSchering  Plough  Corp.  Intron/Temodar  Consumer  Class \nAction, 678 F.3d 235, 245 (3d Cir. 2012) (quoting Lujan, 504 \nU.S. at 560 n.1). That putative litigants must suffer in some \ndiscrete  and personal  fashion ensures, first, that “the legal \nquestions presented . . . will be resolved, not in the rarified \natmosphere of a debating society, but in a concrete factual \ncontext  conducive  to  a  realistic  appreciation  of  the \n16 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 17      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nconsequences  of  judicial  action,”  and,  second,  that  our \n“exercise of judicial power” shows “[p]roper regard for the . . \n. other two coequal branches of the Federal Government.” \nValley  Forge  Christian  Coll.  v.  Ams.  United  for  the \nSeparation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 471–74 \n(1982). These two concerns—respect for the judicial role and \nseparation of powers—are most salient when courts are asked \n“to review actions of the political branches in the fields of \nintelligence gathering and foreign affairs.” Clapper, 133 S. \nCt. at 1147. \nThe Supreme Court has identified a subset of cases in \nwhich plaintiffs routinely fail to demonstrate particularized \ninjury  because  they  present  only  “generalized  grievances,” \ni.e., injuries that are  “undifferentiated  and  ‘common to all \nmembers of the public.’” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 573–74 (quoting \nUnited  States  v.  Richardson,  418  U.S.  166,  177  (1974)). \n“Whether  styled  as  a  constitutional  or  prudential  limit  on \nstanding,  the  Court  has  sometimes  determined  that  where \nlarge numbers of Americans suffer alike, the political process, \nrather  than  the  judicial  process,  may  provide  the  more \nappropriate  remedy.”  Fed.  Election  Comm’n  v.  Akins,  524 \nU.S.  11,  23  (1998).  Such  cases  often  involve  government \naction directed at the public at large, or harms that by their \nnature touch upon interests that are widely shared. See, e.g., \nSchlesinger, 418 U.S. at 217 (plaintiffs asserting violation of \nthe  Incompatibility  Clause  by  members  of  Congress  also \nserving in the armed reserves lacked standing because their \nonly interest was “to have the Judicial Branch compel the \nExecutive Branch to act in conformity with the [law] . . . an \ninterest shared by all citizens”); Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 \nU.S.  727,  734–36  (1972)  (association  challenging \n17 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 18      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\ndevelopment  of  national  park  lacked  standing  based  on \nalleged “special interest” in conservation). \nNevertheless, “[t]he fact that an injury may be suffered \nby  a large number  of people does not  of itself make that \ninjury a nonjusticiable generalized grievance.” Spokeo, 136 S. \nCt. at 1548 n.7. “The victims’ injuries from a mass tort, for \nexample, are widely shared, to be sure, but each individual \nsuffers a particularized harm.” Id.; see also Massachusetts v. \nEPA, 549 U.S. 497, 526 n.24 (2007) (“[S]tanding is not to be \ndenied  simply  because  many  people  suffer  the  same \ninjury. . . .  To  deny  standing  to  persons  who  are  in  fact \ninjured simply because many others are also injured, would \nmean  that  the  most  injurious  and  widespread  Government \nactions  could  be  questioned  by  nobody.”).  And  although \nparticularity  and  concreteness  are  distinct  elements \nconstituting injury in fact, see Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1545, the \nSupreme Court has also observed that the “judicial language” \naccompanying generalized grievances “invariably appears in \ncases where the harm is not only widely shared, but also of an \nabstract  or  indefinite  nature—for  example,  harm  to  the \n‘common concern for obedience to law.’” Akins, 524 U.S. at \n23 (emphasis added).  \nWe applied these principles in a recent case involving \nallegations of government surveillance. In Hassan v. City of \nNew  York,  the  plaintiffs  claimed  that  the  New  York  City \nPolice Department (NYPD) had implemented a program “to \nmonitor  the  lives  of  Muslims,  their  businesses,  houses  of \nworship, organizations, and schools.” 804 F.3d at 285. The \nprogram  allegedly  entailed  “widespread”  photo  and  video \nsurveillance of “organizations and businesses . . . visibly or \nopenly affiliated with Islam,” and the infiltration of “Muslim-\naffiliated”  groups  with  informants  and  undercover  police \n18 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 19      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nofficers.  Id.  at  285–86.  The  information  gathered  was \ncompiled  into  a  series  of  reports  “document[ing]  .  .  . \nAmerican  Muslim  life  in  painstaking  detail.”  Id.  (internal \nquotation marks omitted). The Hassan plaintiffs discovered \nthe  program  after  some  of  these  reports  became  “widely \npublicized,” and they asserted that the fallout required them \nto alter their ordinary day-to-day conduct. See id. at 287–88. \nWe held that the plaintiffs’ allegations in Hassan were \nsufficient to demonstrate particularized injury under Article \nIII. After determining that they had asserted “an invasion of a \nlegally protected interest”—“[t]he indignity of being singled \nout [by the government] for special burdens on the basis of \none’s religious calling”—we observed that the particularized \nnature of an injury does not turn on the number of persons \nthat may claim it. Id. at 289. “[T]hat hundreds or thousands \n(or even millions) of other persons may have suffered  the \nsame injury does not change the individualized nature of the \nasserted rights and interests at stake.” Id. at 291 (citing Akins, \n524 U.S. at 24). “Harm to all—even in the nuanced world of \nstanding law—cannot be logically equated with harm to no \none.”  Id.  And  with  regard  to  allegations  of  widespread \ngovernment surveillance, we stated that because the plaintiffs \nhad  “claim[ed]  to  be  the  very  targets  of  the  allegedly \nunconstitutional  surveillance,  they  [were]  unquestionably \n‘affect[ed] . . .  in  a  personal  and  individual  way.’”  Id. \n(quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 n.1). \nLike the plaintiffs in Hassan, Schuchardt has alleged a \nprogram of government surveillance that, though universal in \nscope, is unmistakably personal in the purported harm. His \nsecond amended complaint describes PRISM as a dragnet that \ncollects  “all  or  substantially  all  of  the  e-mail  sent  by \nAmerican citizens by means of several large internet service \n19 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 20      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nproviders.”  App.  82.  The  collected  information  allegedly \nencompasses  Schuchardt’s  personal  communications,  and \nincludes not only the kind of intensely private details that one \ncould reasonably expect to find in the email accounts of most \nAmericans—“bank  account  numbers;  credit  card  numbers; \npasswords for financial data; [and] health records”—but also \ndata  influenced  by  Schuchardt’s  personal  circumstances, \nnamely “trade secrets” and “communications with clients of \nSchuchardt’s law firm, which are privileged and confidential \nunder applicable law.” App. 96.  \nThe Government strenuously disputes the plausibility \nof  Schuchardt’s  assertion  that  PRISM  collects  “all  or \nsubstantially all of the e-mail sent by American citizens,” and \nwe address that dispute in detail below. But putting aside for \nthe moment the question of whether Schuchardt’s allegations \nconcerning PRISM are entitled to a presumption of truth, the \nconsequences  that  he  identifies  as  flowing  from  the \nGovernment’s  alleged  dragnet  are  undoubtedly  personal  to \nhim insofar as he has a constitutional right to maintain the \nprivacy of his personal communications, online or otherwise. \nSee  Plumhoff  v.  Rickard,  134  S.  Ct.  2012,  2022  (2014) \n(“Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights . . . which \nmay  not  be  vicariously  asserted.”  (quoting  Alderman  v. \nUnited States,  394 U.S. 165,  174 (1969)).  That interest is \nneither  indivisibly  abstract  nor  indefinite,  see  Warshak  v. \nUnited States, 631 F.3d 266, 288 (6th Cir. 2010), and the fact \nthat a large percentage of the population may share a similar \ninterest “does not change [its] individualized nature” because \nSchuchardt’s  allegations  make  clear  that  he  is  among  the \npersons  that  are  the  “very  targets  of  the  allegedly \nunconstitutional surveillance.” Hassan, 804 F.3d at 291; cf. \nRiley  v.  California,  134  S.  Ct.  2473,  2484–85  (2014) \n20 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 21      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\n(extending  the  warrant  requirement  to  searches  of  cellular \nphones, “which are now such a pervasive and insistent part of \ndaily life that the proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude \nthey were an important feature of human anatomy”). \nB \nHaving determined that Schuchardt’s allegations stated \na  particularized  injury  under  Article  III,  we  now  consider \nwhether those allegations should be credited as true for the \npurpose  of  resolving  the  Government’s  jurisdictional \nobjection. As noted previously, the District Court construed \nthe Government’s motion to dismiss as a facial attack on its \nsubject  matter  jurisdiction.  As  a  result,  we  must  accept \nSchuchardt’s allegations as true, with the important caveat \nthat the presumption of truth attaches only to those allegations \nfor which there is sufficient “factual matter” to render them \n“plausible on [their] face.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. Conclusory \nassertions of fact and legal conclusions are not entitled to the \nsame presumption. See id.; see also Twombly, 550 U.S. at 57; \nConnelly v. Lane Constr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. \n2016) (“Under the pleading regime established by Twombly \nand Iqbal, a court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint \nmust . . . identify allegations that, ‘because they are no more \nthan conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.’” \n(quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679)).6 \n                                                 \n6  We  have  instructed  courts  to  follow  a  three-step \nprocess  to  determine  the  sufficiency  of  a  complaint  in \naccordance with Twombly and Iqbal. “First, [the court] must \ntake note of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a \nclaim.  Second,  it  should  identify  allegations  that,  because \nthey are  no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the \n21 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 22      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\n1 \nWe  have  recognized  that  “[t]he  plausibility \ndetermination  is  a  ‘context-specific  task  that  requires  the \nreviewing  court  to  draw  on  its  judicial  experience  and \ncommon  sense.’”  See,  e.g.,  Connelly,  809  F.3d  at  786–87 \n(quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 675). At the same time, we have \ncautioned  that  the  plausibility  standard  does  not  impose  a \nheightened  pleading requirement,  and that  Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 8(a) continues to require only a “showing” \nthat the pleader is entitled to relief. See, e.g., Phillips v. Cty. \nof Allegheny, 515 F.3d  224, 233–34 (3d Cir. 2008) (“The \n[Supreme]  Court  emphasized  .  .  .  that  it  was  neither \ndemanding a heightened pleading of specifics nor imposing a \nprobability  requirement.”)).  Indeed,  although  Twombly  and \nIqbal emphasized the plaintiff’s burden of pleading sufficient \n“factual  matter,”  the  Supreme  Court  also  expressly \n“disavow[ed]” the requirement that a plaintiff plead “specific \nfacts.” Boykin v. KeyCorp, 521 F.3d 202, 215 (2d Cir. 2008) \n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 569, and Erickson v. Pardus, \n551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007)).  \nImplicit in the notion that a plaintiff need not plead \n“specific facts” to survive a motion to dismiss is that courts \ncannot  inject  evidentiary  issues  into  the  plausibility \n                                                                                                             \nassumption  of  truth.  Finally,  when  there  are  well-pleaded \nfactual allegations, the court should assume their veracity and \nthen  determine  whether  they  plausibly  give  rise  to  an \nentitlement  to  relief.”  Connelly,  809  F.3d  at  787  &  n.4 \n(internal  citations,  quotations  marks,  and  original \nmodifications omitted). \n22 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 23      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\ndetermination.7 See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556 (“[A] well-\npleaded  complaint  may  proceed  even  if  it  strikes  a  savvy \njudge that actual proof of those facts is improbable.”). This \nincludes  the  weighing  of  facts  or  the  requirement  that  a \nplaintiff plead “specific facts” beyond those necessary to state \na  valid  claim.  See  id.  at  573  n.8  (“[W]hen  a  complaint \nadequately states a claim, it may not be dismissed based on a \ndistrict court’s assessment that the plaintiff will fail to find \nevidentiary support for his allegations or prove his claim to \nthe satisfaction of the factfinder.”). The same logic precludes \na court from rejecting pleaded facts based on some blanket \nexclusion of evidence. See Ricciuti v. New York City Transit \nAuth., 941 F.2d 119, 124 (2d Cir. 1991). “A contrary rule \n                                                 \n7  The  “evidentiary  issues”  to  which  we  refer  are \ndistinct  from  the  question  of  what  documents  may  be \nconsidered  in  resolving  a  motion  to  dismiss  applying  the \nstandard of review under Rule 12(b)(6), or, as relevant here, \naddressing  a  facial  challenge  to  subject  matter  jurisdiction \nunder  Rule  12(b)(1).  The  general  rule  for  determining  the \nscope of the pleadings in this scenario is that a district court \n“may  consider  only  the  allegations  contained  in  the \npleading[s] to determine [their] sufficiency,” but is permitted \nto consider “document[s] integral to or explicitly relied upon \nin the complaint,” and “any undisputedly authentic document \nthat a defendant attaches . . . if the plaintiff’s claims are based \non the document,” without converting the motion into one for \nsummary judgment. See In re Asbestos Prods. Liability Litig. \n(No. VI), 822 F.3d 125, 133 & n.7 (3d Cir. 2016) (internal \ncitations  and  quotation  marks  omitted).

Cty. of Monroe, 853 F. Supp. 2d \n364, 378 (W.D.N.Y. 2012); see also Whitney v. Guys, Inc., \n700 F.3d 1118, 1128–29 (8th Cir. 2012). \nAccordingly, although it is unclear whether the District \nCourt applied a heightened pleading standard in this case, to \nthe extent that its opinion suggests that Schuchardt’s reliance \non “media reports and other publicly-available information” \nwas impermissible, we disagree.8 See Schuchardt, 2015 WL \n5732117, at *6. Indeed, we held that the plaintiffs in Hassan \nhad plausibly pleaded both their standing to sue and claims \nfor  relief  based  on  NYPD  surveillance  reports  that  the \nplaintiffs had discovered only after they had been “widely \npublicized.”  See  804  F.3d  at  287.  Similarly,  we  take  the \n                                                 \n8  Despite  Clapper’s  observation  that  the  standing \ninquiry  is  “especially  rigorous”  in  matters  touching  on \n“intelligence  gathering  and  foreign  affairs,”  133  S.  Ct.  at \n1147, to our knowledge no court has imposed a heightened \npleading standard for cases implicating national security. See \nJewel, 673 F.3d at 913 (“Article III imposes no heightened \nstanding requirement for the often difficult cases that involve \nconstitutional  claims  against  the  executive  involving \nsurveillance.”).  In  this  appeal,  we  will  assume  without \ndeciding that a heightened pleading standard does not apply. \nSee,  e.g.,  Jones  v.  Bock,  549  U.S.  199,  212–13  (2007) \n(explaining that “courts should generally not depart from the \nusual  practice  under  the  Federal  Rules  on  the  basis  of \nperceived  policy  concerns,”  including  the  imposition  of  a \npleading standard more stringent than the “short and plain \nstatement” of the claim under Rule 8). \n24 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 25      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nDistrict Court’s enumeration of the types of evidence giving \nrise to the plaintiffs’ standing in Jewel and ACLU—“a leaked \nFISC  order  or  a  detailed  insider  account”—as  merely  a \nsuggestion of facts that would have strongly supported the \nplausibility  of  Schuchardt’s  allegations,  rather  than  a \nrequirement that he plead those specific facts. See 2015 WL \n6732117, at *6. Such limitations on the scope or source of \nfacts  that  a  plaintiff  may  plead  to  reach  the  threshold  of \nplausibility  run  counter  to  the  longstanding  principles \nanimating pretrial dispositions, as set forth in Twombly and \nIqbal,  and  come  close  to  the  weighing  of  evidence  and \ncredibility determinations that are the exclusive province of \nthe  factfinder.  See  Iqbal,  556  U.S.  at  681  (“It  is  the \nconclusory  nature  of  respondent’s  allegations,  rather  than \ntheir extravagantly fanciful nature, that disentitles them to the \npresumption of truth.”); Twombly, 550 U.S. at  556 (“Rule \n12(b)(6)  does  not  countenance  .  .  .  dismissals  based  on  a \njudge’s  disbelief  of  a  complaint’s  factual  allegations.” \n(quoting Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 327 (1989)); see \nalso  Anderson  v.  Liberty  Lobby,  Inc.,  477  U.S.  242,  255 \n(1986).  \nThe  upshot  of  all  this  for  Schuchardt  is  that  his \nreliance  on  news  articles  and  other  disclosures  concerning \nPRISM weighs neither in his favor nor against him. Instead, \nthese  public  reports  (and  the  leaked  classified  materials \naccompanying  them)  are  simply  part  and  parcel  of  the \n“factual  matter”  that  must  be  considered  in  assessing  the \nplausibility  of  his  allegations.  We  will  therefore  examine \nthose  reports  in  conjunction  with  the  rest  of  Schuchardt’s \npleadings  to  ascertain  whether  he  plausibly  alleged  a \nparticularized injury under Article III. \n25 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 26      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\n2 \nBased on our review of the pleadings, the plausibility \nof  Schuchardt’s  alleged  injury—that  the  Government  has \nbeen “unlawfully intercepting, accessing, monitoring and/or \nstoring [his] private communications,” App. 95—depends on \nthe plausibility of his assertion that PRISM functions as an \nindiscriminate dragnet which captures “all or substantially all \nof the e-mail sent by American citizens.” App. 82. Aside from \nthis  sweeping  allegation,  Schuchardt  has  supplied  no  facts \nsuggesting how (or why) the Government would have been \ninterested in his online activity. His burden, therefore, was to \nallege  enough  “factual  matter”  to  make  plausible  the \nGovernment’s virtual dragnet. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679; see also \nArpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 19 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nSchuchardt  pleaded  facts  drawn  from  news  articles \npublished  by  the  Guardian,  as  well  as  the  leaked  and \npurportedly  classified  materials  from  which  those  articles \nwere  derived.  As  we  noted  in  Part  I.B,  supra,  these \ndocuments state that the NSA, through PRISM, has obtained \n“direct”  access  to  the  technical  facilities  of  several  major \ninternet service providers. App. 53, 84. They indicate specific \ndates  for  when  those  providers  granted  the  Government \naccess, App. 60, and that the degree of access those providers \ngranted enables the Government to query their facilities at \nwill  for  “real-time  interception  of  an  individual’s  internet \nactivity.” App. 66. They also describe the types of activity \nthat may be accessed, encompassing “both the content and \nmetadata of . . . private e-mail communications” sent by those \nproviders on behalf of their subscribers. App. 59, 96. Finally, \nthey claim that the rate of data “[c]ollection is outpacing [the \nGovernment’s] ability to ingest, process and store [the data] \nto the ‘norms’ to which [it has] become accustomed,” App. \n26 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 27      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\n64,  and  that  the  NSA’s  overriding  surveillance  goal  is  to \n“[c]ollect it [a]ll,” App. 61. \nBy  including  these  factual  averments  in  his  second \namended  complaint,  Schuchardt  outlined  a  coherent  and \nplausible case supporting his PRISM-as-dragnet allegations. \nFirst, his alleged facts specify, at least to some degree, the \nmeans through which the NSA captures “all or substantially \nall of the e-mail sent by American citizens,” App. 82, namely, \nby  compelling  companies  that  provide  email  and  other \ninternet services to cooperate with the NSA in the collection \nof  their  customers’  data.  Although  the  technical  details  of \nhow each company’s email service integrates within PRISM’s \ninfrastructure are not specified, “on a motion to dismiss, we \n‘presum[e]  that  general  allegations  embrace  those  specific \nfacts that are necessary to support the claim.’” Lujan, 504 \nU.S. at 561 (quoting Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. \n781,  889  (1990)).  Moreover,  according  to  the  NSA  itself, \nPRISM entails data “collection directly from the servers” of \nthese companies, and Schuchardt describes events involving \nLavabit, a company that resisted the Government’s demands \nto “install a device on its server which would have provided \nthe [Government] with access to the full content of all e-mail \nmessages for all of Lavabit’s . . . customers.” See App. 53, 84, \n87.  Thus,  the  pleaded  facts  plausibly  allege  the  technical \nmeans  through  which  PRISM  purportedly  achieves  a \nnationwide email dragnet.9 \n                                                 \n9 We do not read the Ninth Circuit’s opinion in Jewel \nto suggest a different conclusion. To be sure, the plaintiff in \nJewel  was  able  to  allege  “with  particularity”  that  her \ncommunications were seized by “focus[ing]” her complaint \non  interceptions  occurring  at  a  specific  technical  facility \n27 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 28      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nSecond,  Schuchardt’s  allegations  are  replete  with \ndetails  confirming  PRISM’s  operational  scope  and \ncapabilities.  The  exhibits  attached  to  his  second  amended \ncomplaint include a slide from a purported NSA presentation \nidentifying  company  names  and  the  dates  they  began \ncooperating with the agency. Another slide confirms that—\nconsistent with a dragnet capturing “all or substantially all of \nthe e-mail sent by American citizens”—the scale of the data \ncollected by PRISM is so vast that the Government reported \ndifficulty processing it according “to the ‘norms’ to which [it \nhas]  become  accustomed.”  App.  64;  see  also  App.  52 \n(characterizing PRISM as the “SIGAD Used Most in NSA \nReporting”);10  App.  61  (indicating  the  NSA’s  “New \nCollection Posture” of “Collect[ing] it All”).  \n                                                                                                             \noperated by a single telecommunications provider. See 673 \nF.3d at 910 (discussing the plaintiff’s allegations concerning \nAT&T’s  “SG3  Secure  Room”  and  “particular  electronic \ncommunications  equipment”  at  the  company’s  “Folsom \nStreet” facility in San Francisco). Although the details she \nalleged were quite colorful, they differ in degree, not in kind \nfrom Schuchardt’s averments. In both cases, the parties relied \non an insider account of the alleged surveillance program at \nissue—Schuchardt on a former NSA contractor, and Jewel on \na  former  AT&T  telecommunications  technician.  Those \ninsiders in turn have relied either on documentary evidence \nallegedly produced by the Government itself, or their personal \nexperiences in executing the surveillance program.  \n10  SIGAD  stands  for  the  term  “Signals  Intelligence \nActivity Designator,” which “is an alphanumeric designator \nthat  identifies  a  facility  used  for  collecting  Signals \nIntelligence (SIGINT).” Laura K. Donohue, Section 702 and \n28 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 29      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nFinally,  the  pleaded  facts  support  Schuchardt’s \nallegation  that  the  scope  of  PRISM’s  data  collection \nencompasses  his  personal  email.  The  NSA  presentation \nidentifies  specific  companies  participating  in  the  PRISM \nprogram, and indicates that NSA analysts receive the content \nof emails collected as part of the program. Schuchardt alleged \nthat  he  uses  email  services  provided  by  two  of  those \ncompanies—Google and Yahoo—so we need not speculate \nabout  whether  Schuchardt’s  own  communications  were \ncaptured because he specified the scope of PRISM’s dragnet \nwith enough “factual matter” to make additional inferential \nleaps unnecessary. See Klayman, 800 F.3d at 559 (opinion of \nBrown, J.) (permitting the inference that the bulk telephone \nmetadata  program  under  Section  215  encompassed  the \nplaintiff’s  communications  in  light  of  facts  alleging  “the \ngovernment’s  efforts  to  ‘create  a  comprehensive  metadata \ndatabase.’”). \n3 \nThe  Government  raises  three  principal  arguments \nchallenging  the  plausibility  of  Schuchardt’s  PRISM \nallegations. First, it argues that Clapper and its application by \nthe D.C. Circuit in Klayman require us to find his allegations \nimplausible. We disagree. \nTwo aspects of Clapper distinguish it from this case. \nFirst,  because  the  Clapper  plaintiffs  raised  a  facial \nconstitutional challenge to Section 702 on the day the statute \nwas  enacted,  they  pleaded  only  prospective  injury,  i.e., \n                                                                                                             \nthe  Collection  of  International  Telephone  and  Internet \nContent, 38 Harv. J. L. & Pub. Pol’y 117, 119 n.3 (2015). \n29 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 30      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\n“potential future surveillance.” See 133 S. Ct. at 1150. And \nbecause  that  “potential”  relied  on  a  “speculative  chain  of \npossibilities,”  the  Supreme  Court  concluded  that  they  had \nfailed to satisfy the imminence and traceability elements of \ninjury-in-fact  under  Article  III.  Here,  in  contrast, \nSchuchardt’s alleged injury has already occurred insofar as he \nclaims  the  NSA  seized  his  emails.  It  is  therefore  not \nsurprising that the Government has been unable to formulate \nan  analogous  “speculative  chain”  that  would  doom \nSchuchardt’s constitutional standing.  \nAnother  critical  distinction  between  this  case  and \nClapper is that the district court entered summary judgment, a \nprocedural posture that required the plaintiffs to identify a \ntriable  issue  of  material  fact  supported  by  an  evidentiary \nrecord. See id. at 1146, 1149. In contrast, Schuchardt sought \nto avoid dismissal in a facial jurisdictional challenge raised \nunder  Rule  12(b)(1),  which  requires  him  only  to  state  a \nplausible claim, a significantly lighter burden. This distinction \nin the standard of review is also reflected in cases concerning \nnational security surveillance from our sister courts. Compare \nACLU, 785 F.3d at 800 (plaintiffs had standing on motion to \ndismiss); Jewel, 673 F.3d at 906–07 (same), with Klayman, \n800 F.3d at 568 (opinion of Williams, J.) (plaintiffs lacked \nstanding to pursue preliminary injunction because there was \nno “substantial likelihood” that they could establish injury-in-\nfact,  observing  that  summary  judgment  imposes  a  “lighter \nburden” than the “substantial likelihood of success” necessary \nto obtain a preliminary injunction); ACLU v. NSA, 493 F.3d \n644,  650–51,  667–70  (6th  Cir.  2007)  (plaintiffs  failed  to \nestablish injury-in-fact on summary judgment because they \nhad  “no  evidence”  on  various  points  of  causation).  Here, \nSchuchardt has gone beyond mere allegations to survive a \n30 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 31      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nmotion to dismiss by creating a limited evidentiary record to \nsupport his allegations.  \nThe  Government’s  reliance  on  Klayman  is  also \nmisplaced. There, the D.C. Circuit vacated the district court’s \npreliminary injunction, holding that the plaintiffs had failed to \ndemonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. \nSee 800 F.3d at 561. However, the panel split on the issue of \nthe  plaintiffs’  standing,  and  also  disagreed  on  whether  to \nremand the case for further proceedings or outright dismissal. \nSee id. at 564 (opinion of Brown, J.) (plaintiffs had satisfied \n“the  bare  requirements  of  standing,”  remanding  for \njurisdictional discovery); id. at 565 (opinion of Williams, J.) \n(plaintiffs  lacked  standing  to  seek  preliminary  injunction, \nremanding for jurisdictional discovery); id. at 569 (opinion of \nSentelle, J.) (plaintiffs lacked  standing vel non, remanding \nwith order to dismiss). Under these circumstances, it seems \nclear to us that Klayman’s persuasive force is minimized by \nits splintered reasoning, different procedural posture, and the \nfact that the D.C. Circuit addressed itself to a now-defunct \nsurveillance program authorized by a separate provision of \nFISA. Accordingly, neither  Clapper nor  Klayman supports \nthe Government in this case. \nSecond,  the  Government  contends  that  Schuchardt’s \nallegations “say at most that the government may have the \ncapability  to  seize  and  store  most  electronic \ncommunications,” but “[t]hey do not say that the government \nis searching or seizing most, let alone all, e-mail.” Gov’t Br. \n21.  We  agree  that  Schuchardt’s  alleged  facts—even  if \nproven—do not conclusively establish that PRISM operates \nas a dragnet on the scale he has alleged. The language of the \nleaked materials Schuchardt relies on is imprecise. The use of \nthe term “direct” in the NSA’s presentation could mean, for \n31 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 32      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nexample,  that  the  Government  has  complete  discretion  to \nsearch  all  electronic  information  held  by  a  company \nparticipating  in  PRISM  at  will;  this  would  certainly  be \nconsistent with the “real-time” interception capability that the \nNSA  allegedly  possesses,  and  could  qualify  as  an \nunconstitutional  “seizure”  of  all  information  stored  on  the \ncompany’s servers. On the other hand, “direct” could mean \nthat the Government merely has the legal authority to compel \nparticipating companies to turn over “communications that \nmay  be  of  foreign-intelligence  value  because  they  are  . . . \nassociated  with  the  e-mail  addresses  that  are  used  by \nsuspected foreign terrorists.” Gov’t Br. 22. In that scenario, it \nis implausible that Schuchardt’s communications would be \ntargeted by PRISM. \nAt this early stage of litigation, however, Schuchardt is \nentitled to any inference in his favor that may be “reasonably” \ndrawn from his pleaded facts. See, e.g., King Drug Co. of \nFlorence, Inc. v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 791 F.3d 388, \n398 n.11 (3d Cir. 2015) (citing Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678–79). \nAnd  as  we  have  explained,  the  inference  that  PRISM \n“collects  all  or  substantially  all  of  the  e-mail  sent  by \nAmerican citizens,” App. 82, is one supported by his pleaded \n“factual matter.” Accordingly, in this procedural posture, we \ncannot accept the Government’s preferred inference. \nFinally,  the  Government  disputes  the  notion  that \nPRISM  is  a  dragnet,  i.e.,  that  it  is  “based  on  the \nindiscriminate collection of information in bulk.” See Gov’t \nBr. 22 (quoting PCLOB Report at  111).  According to the \nGovernment,  “the  program  consists  entirely  of  targeting \nspecific  persons  that  may  be  of  foreign-intelligence  value \nbecause  they  are,  for  example,  associated  with  the  e-mail \n32 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 33      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\naddresses that are used by suspected foreign terrorists.” Id. \nUnder this view, to intercept communications using PRISM: \nAnalysts first identify a non-U.S. person located \noutside  the  United  States  who  is  likely  to \ncommunicate  certain  types  of  foreign \nintelligence information, such as an individual \nwho belongs to a foreign terrorist organization \nor facilitates its activities. Analysts also attempt \nto identify a means by which this foreign target \ncommunicates, such as an e-mail address, or a \ntelephone number; any such address, number, \nor  other  identifier  is  known  as  a  “selector.” \nPRISM collection occurs when the government \nobtains from telecommunications providers . . .  \ncommunications  sent  to  or  from  specified \nselectors.  \nGov’t Br. 6–7 (internal citations omitted). \nSeveral commentators11 and the few courts12 that have \nexamined  PRISM  appear  to  agree  with  the  Government’s \n                                                 \n11 See, e.g., Donohue, supra note 8, at 119 n.2 (“Once \nforeign  intelligence  acquisition  has  been  authorized  under \nSection  702,  the  government  sends  written  directives  to \nelectronic communication service providers compelling their \nassistance  in  the  acquisition  of  communications.”  (quoting \nPCLOB  Report  at  7));  Nathan  Alexander  Sales, \nDomesticating  Programmatic  Surveillance:  Some  Thoughts \non the NSA Controversy, 10 I/S: J. L. & Pol’y for Info. Soc’y \n523, 526 (2014) (“[In] PRISM . . . the NSA targets specific \nnon-Americans  who  are  reasonably  believed  to  be  located \noutside the country, and also engages in bulk collection of \n33 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 34      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nview  of  the  program’s  “targeted”  nature.  So  too  has  the \nPCLOB, whose report on PRISM the Government has asked \nus  to  consider.  See  PCLOB  Report  at  33–34.  These \nauthorities  are  substantial,  and  if  correct,  would  tend  to \n                                                                                                             \nsome foreign-to-foreign communications that happen to be \npassing  through  telecommunications  infrastructure  in  the \nUnited  States.”).  The  Washington  Post  also  amended  its \ninitial report on PRISM to suggest that “imprecision on the \npart of the NSA” in the wording of its presentation left open \nthe possibility that PRISM collection still required the agency \nto request materials from the participating companies, rather \nthan directly from the companies’ servers. See Jonathan Hall, \nWashington Post Updates, Hedges on Initial PRISM Report, \nForbes  (June  7,  2013,  9:08  PM),  https://perma.cc/7L6A-\nH22D.  \n12 See, e.g., United States v. Hasbajrami, 2016 WL \n1029500,  at  *6  (E.D.N.Y.  Mar.  8,  2016)  (“In  PRISM \ncollection,  the  government  identifies  the  user  accounts  it \nwants  to  monitor  and  sends  a  ‘selector’—a  specific \ncommunications facility, such as a target’s email address or \ntelephone number—to the relevant communications service \nprovider.  A  government  directive  then  compels  the \ncommunications service provider to give it communications \nsent to or from that selector (i.e., the government ‘tasks’ the \nselector).” (internal citations omitted)); Wikimedia Found. v. \nNSA, 143 F. Supp. 3d 344, 348–49 (D. Md. 2015) (“Under a \nsurveillance  program  called  ‘PRISM,’  U.S.-based  Internet \nService  Providers  furnish  the  NSA  with  electronic \ncommunications  that  contain  information  specified  by  the \nNSA.”). \n34 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 35      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nundermine  Schuchardt’s  ability  to  show  that  his  own \nelectronic  communications  were  seized  by  the  PRISM \nprogram. \nThe problem for the Government at this stage is that \nthe scope of materials that a court may consider in evaluating \na facial jurisdictional challenge raised in a motion under Rule \n12(b)(1) is not unconstrained. As with motions under Rule \n12(b)(6),  the  court  is  limited  to  the  four  corners  of  the \ncomplaint, “document[s] integral to or explicitly relied upon \nin the complaint,” and “any undisputedly authentic document \nthat a defendant attaches . . . if the plaintiff’s claims are based \non the document.” In re Asbestos Prods. Liability Litig. (No. \nVI), 822 F.3d 125, 133 & n.7 (3d Cir. 2016) (quoting In re \nBurlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d \nCir. 1997)). Schuchardt’s pleadings are in no way “based on” \nany countervailing authorities that support the Government’s \nposition,  nor  are  those  authorities  integral  to  or  explicitly \nrelied upon by his complaint—accordingly, we must ignore \ntheir persuasive value, whatever it may be, at this stage of the \nlitigation.  See  Gould  Elecs.,  220  F.3d  at  176.  Likewise, \ninsofar  as  the  Government’s  arguments  present  new \ninformation disagreeing with the factual premises underlying \nSchuchardt’s claims, we cannot consider them in this facial \njurisdictional challenge, the sole purpose of which is to test \nthe  legal  sufficiency  of  the  plaintiff’s  jurisdictional \naverments.  Instead,  disagreements  concerning  jurisdictional \nfacts should be presented in a factual challenge, at which time \nthe  court,  after  allowing  the  plaintiff  “to  respond  with \nevidence  supporting jurisdiction,”  may  fully  adjudicate the \nparties’ dispute, including the resolution of any questions of \nfact. Id. at 177.  \n35 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 36      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nV \nOur  decision  today  is  narrow:  we  hold  only  that \nSchuchardt’s second amended complaint pleaded his standing \nto sue for a violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be \nfree from unreasonable searches and seizures. This does not \nmean that he has standing to sue, as the Government remains \nfree upon remand to make a factual jurisdictional challenge to \nSchuchardt’s pleading. In anticipation of such a challenge, we \nprovide  the  following  guidance  to  the  District  Court  on \nremand. \nSchuchardt  has  suggested  that  he  is  entitled  to \njurisdictional discovery. See Transcript of Oral Argument at \n40–41, Schuchardt v. Obama, No. 15-3491 (3d Cir. May 17, \n2016).  We  leave  that  question  to  the  District  Court’s \ndiscretion with the caveat that “jurisdictional discovery is not \navailable  merely  because the plaintiff requests it.”  Lincoln \nBenefit Life Ins. Co. v. AEI Life, LLC, 800 F.3d 99, 108 n.38 \n(3d Cir. 2015). Jurisdictional discovery is not a license for the \nparties to engage in a “fishing expedition,” id., and that fact is \nparticularly  true  in  a  case  like  this  one,  which  involves \npotential issues of national security. In this very context, the \nSupreme Court has cautioned that jurisdictional discovery—\neven if conducted in camera—cannot be used to probe the \ninternal (and most likely classified) workings of the  national \nsecurity apparatus of the United States. See Clapper, 131 S. \nCt.  at  1149  n.4  (“[T]his  type  of  hypothetical  disclosure \nproceeding  would  allow  a  terrorist  (or  his  attorney)  to \ndetermine  whether  he  is  currently  under  U.S.  surveillance \nsimply  by  filing  a  lawsuit  challenging  the  Government’s \nsurveillance program.”). For that reason, the District Court \nshould take care to circumscribe the scope of discovery and \n36 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 37      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nany ex parte and in camera procedures to only the factual \nquestions necessary to determine its jurisdiction.13  \nFinally, nothing in our opinion should be construed to \npreclude  the  Government  from  raising  any  applicable \nprivileges  barring  discovery—including  the  state  secrets \ndoctrine—or to suggest how the District Court should rule on \nany  privilege  the  Government  may  choose  to  assert.  See \nUnited States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1, 10 (1953). \n*  *  * \nFor  the  stated  reasons,  we  will  vacate  the  District \nCourt’s  order  dismissing  Schuchardt’s  second  amended \ncomplaint and remand for proceedings consistent with this \nopinion. \n                                                 \n13 For example, the linchpin of Schuchardt’s standing \nis his allegation that PRISM collects “all or substantially all \nof the e-mail sent by American citizens.” The District Court \nmay wish to consider what discovery is necessary for it to \nadjudicate  the  veracity  of  that  allegation  while  permitting \nSchuchardt an adequate evidentiary response. See also Jewel \nv. NSA, 2015 WL 545925, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 10, 2015) \n(holding that plaintiffs had failed to establish their standing to \nchallenge  Upstream,  another  putative  NSA  electronic \nsurveillance  program,  because  “the  evidence  at  summary \njudgment  [was]  insufficient  to  establish  that  the  Upstream \ncollection process operates in the manner in which Plaintiffs \nallege[d] it does”). \n37 \n ",

Schuchardt,  individually  and  doing  business  as  the \nSchuchardt Law Firm, files this Complaint against the above-captioned Defendants.     \nParties \n1.  The Plaintiff, Elliott J. Schuchardt, is an attorney having an office located at \nUnited States Steel Building, Suite 660, 600 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15219.   \n2.  Defendant Barack H. Obama is President of the United States.  As such, he \nhas  ultimate  authority  over  the  actions  of  the  United  States  federal  government.  \nPresident Obama maintains an address at The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, \nWashington, DC 20500. \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 1   Filed 06/02/14   Page 2 of 9\n3.  Defendant James R. Clapper is the Director of National Intelligence (“DNI”).  \nAs such, Clapper has ultimate authority over the activities of the intelligence community.  \nDefendant Clapper maintains an address at James R. Clapper, Washington, DC 20511.  \n4.  Defendant  Admiral  Michael  R.  Rogers  is  the  Director  of  the  National \nSecurity Agency (“NSA”).  As such, Rogers has ultimate authority for supervising and \nimplementing  all  operations  and  functions  of  the  NSA,  the  agency  responsible  for \nconducting surveillance authorized by the challenged law.  Admiral Rogers maintains an \naddress at National Security Agency, 9800 Savage Road, Fort Meade, MD 20755.   \n5.  Defendant James B. Comey is the Director of the FBI.  As such, Comey is \nresponsible for applications made to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court under \nSection  215  of  the  Patriot  Act.    Defendant  Comey  maintains  an  address  at  FBI \nHeadquarters, 935 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20535-0001.   \nBackground \n6.  The  Plaintiff,  Elliott  J.  Schuchardt,  is  a  consumer  of  various  types  of \nelectronic communication, storage, and internet-search services.  These include the e-\nmail services provided by Google and Yahoo; the internet search service provided by \nGoogle; the cloud storage service provided by Dropbox; the e-mail and instant message \nservices  provided  by  Facebook;  and  the  cell  phone  and  text  communication  service \nprovided by Verizon Communications.  \n7.  The  Defendants  are  unlawfully  intercepting,  accessing  and  storing  the \nprivate communications of the Plaintiff, made or stored through such services.   \n8.  This complaint will refer to the Defendants' above-described activities as the \n“collection” of private communications. \n  2 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 1   Filed 06/02/14   Page 3 of 9\n9.  The Defendants’ collection of data includes both the content of the Plaintiff’s \ne-mail, as well as the “metadata” associated with such e-mail. \n10.  For purposes of this complaint, the content of an e-mail includes the actual \ntext  of  the  e-mail  and  any  attachments  to  the  e-mail,  including  photographs  and \ndocuments.    \n11.  The term “metadata” describes how, when and by whom a particular set of \ndata was created, as well as the format of the data.   \n12.  For an e-mail, the metadata includes the e-mail accounts which sent and \nreceived the e-mail, the sender’s e-mail service provider, the date and time the e-mail \nwas sent, and the name and address of each account holder. \n13.  For a telephone call, the metadata includes the originating and destination \nphone numbers, the date and time of the call, the duration of the call, and the name and \naddress of the persons who hold such phone numbers. \n14.  Since  March  12,  2006,  the  Defendants  have  been  collecting  both  the \ncontent and the metadata of the Plaintiffs’ private e-mail communications sent through the \nYahoo e-mail system.   \n15.  Since  approximately  2008,  the  Defendants  have  been  collecting  the \nmetadata  associated  with  the  Plaintiff's  cell  phone  communications  through  Verizon \nCommunications.   \n16.  Since  January  14,  2009,  the  Defendants  have  been  collecting  both  the \ncontent and the metadata of the Plaintiffs’ private e-mail communications sent through the \nGoogle “gmail” e-mail system.  \n  3 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 1   Filed 06/02/14   Page 4 of 9\n17.  Since January 14, 2009, the Defendants have been collecting the content \nand the metadata of the Plaintiffs’ private internet search history through the Google \nsearch website.  \n18.  Since June 3, 2009, the Defendants have been collecting the content of the \nPlaintiff's e-mail and instant messages through Facebook.       \n19.  Upon  information  and  belief,  since  approximately  June  2013,  the \nDefendants have been collecting the content and metadata of documents stored by the \nPlaintiff using the Dropbox cloud storage service.   \n20.  The documents, images and communications collected by the Defendants \ncontain information of a private and confidential nature.  Such communications include \nbank account numbers; credit card numbers; passwords for financial data; health records; \nand trade secrets of a confidential and valuable nature.   \n21.  The  documents  and  communications  collected  by  the  Defendants  also \ninclude communications with clients of Schuchardt's law firm, which are privileged and \nconfidential under applicable law.   \n22.  Upon information and belief, the Defendants are storing such information in \na  computer  database,  or  through  a  government  program,  which  the  Defendants  call \n“Prism.”   \n23.  The Defendants’ conduct is unlawful under the United States Constitution, \nthe civil and criminal laws of the federal government, and the civil and criminal laws of the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania.   \n24.  It is impossible to understate the danger of the Defendants' conduct.  The \nframers  of  the  United  States  constitution  were  familiar  with  abusive  governmental \nconduct.  They therefore specifically stated that the United States government would not \n  4 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 1   Filed 06/02/14   Page 5 of 9\nhave the power to search and seize the private papers of United States citizens without \nobtaining a warrant from a neutral and detached magistrate, issued upon a finding of \nprobable cause.   \n25.  Now, for the first time in history, a small group of persons within the United \nStates government is attempting to seize all of the private, electronic communications of \nthe American citizenry, with little or no independent review. \n26.  The  system  set  up  by  the  Defendants  constitutes  nothing  more  than  a \nsystem of “turnkey totalitarianism.”  If the Defendants’ conduct is not reigned in promptly \nby the courts, the Defendants will have the power to engage in widespread blackmail, and \ntheft of significantly more than information.   \n27.  Every citizen of the United States is at risk.  This includes the trade secrets \nof the Fortune 500 and billions of dollars held by New York investment banks.   \nCOUNT I \nDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief \nViolation of the Fourth Amendment \n28.  The  Plaintiff  incorporates  by  reference  all  of  the  above  paragraphs  as \nthough set forth herein in their entirety. \n29.  According to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, this Court has the power to adjudicate a \ndispute between the Plaintiff and the Defendants involving any issue involving federal law.  \n30.  The  Plaintiff  is  aggrieved  by  the  above-described  conduct  of  the \nDefendants.  \n31.  The Defendants are subject to the law established by the United States \nConstitution.   \n32.  According to the 4th Amendment of the United States Constitution:  \n  5 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 1   Filed 06/02/14   Page 6 of 9\nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, \nand effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not \nbe violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, \nsupported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place \nto be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. \n33.  The Plaintiff has an expectation of privacy in the above-described private \ninformation and electronic communciations being collected by the Defendants.   \n34.  The Defendants have unlawfully collected such information in violationof the \n4th Amendment, without obtaining a warrant and without probable cause.   \n35.  As  of  this  date,  the  Defendants  have  refused  to  provide  any  public \nexplanation of the legal authority that purports to authorize their intrusion into the affairs of \nthe Plaintiff.  \n36.  The Plaintiff respectfully submits that any such purported authority, when \nultimately disclosed by the Defendants, is unlawful as a violation of the 4th Amendment of \nthe United States Constitution.  \n37.  If the Defendants are purporting to act pursuant to secret orders established \nby the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the Plaintiff respectfully submits that any \nsuch  authority  is  also  unlawful  as  a  violation  of  the  due  process  clause  of  the  14th \nAmendment.   \n  WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter \nan order (a) enjoining the Defendants from engaging in any further collection of the \nabove-described confidential information of the Plaintiff, and (b) establishing procedures \nto ensure that the Defendants refrain from unlawful conduct in the future.   \n  6 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 1   Filed 06/02/14   Page 7 of 9\nCOUNT II \nInjunctive Relief \nIntrusion / Invasion of Privacy \n38.  The  Plaintiff  incorporates  by  reference  all  of  the  above  paragraphs  as \nthough set forth herein in their entirety. \n39.  The  Defendants  have  invaded  the  privacy  of  the  Plaintiff  --  and  have \nintruded upon the private affairs of the Plaintiff -- in violation of Pennsylvania law.   \n40.  It is unclear whether monetary damages will be sufficient to compensate the \nPlaintiff.   \n41.  The Defendants have already compromised, or caused the termination of, \nall secure e-mail communication services based in the United States.  This includes the e-\nmail  service,  Lavabit,  which  previously  sought  to  keep  its  communications  safe  and \nprivate from the Defendants.  \n42.  Upon information and belief, the Defendants have also compromised the \nsecurity of the cloud storage service, Dropbox.     \n43.  Given the dearth of secure, alternative e-mail and cloud storage services \navailable in the United States, the Plaintiff respectfully seeks injunctive relief against the \nDefendants.     \n  WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter \nan order (a) enjoining the Defendants from engaging in any further collection of the \nabove-described confidential information of the Plaintiff, and (b) establishing procedures \nto ensure that the Defendants refrain from unlawful conduct in the future.    \n  7 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 1   Filed 06/02/14   Page 8 of 9\nCOUNT III \nDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief \nViolation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \n44.  The  Plaintiff  incorporates  by  reference  all  of  the  above  paragraphs  as \nthough set forth herein in their entirety. \n45.  According to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, this Court has the power to adjudicate a \ndispute between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants involving any issue involving federal \nlaw.  \n46.  The  Plaintiff  is  aggrieved  by  the  above-described  conduct  of  the \nDefendants.  \n47.  If the Defendants are purporting to act pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, then it appears that the Defendants are in violation of such act.   \n48.  According  to  50  U.S.C.  § 1861(b)(2)(B),  the  Defendants  are  required  to \nutilize “minimization procedures” with respect to information that is inadvertently obtained \nconcerning an “unconsenting United States person” during an investigation relating to \ninternational terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. \n49.  On  July  29,  2009,  Attorney  General  Eric  Holder  adopted  minimization \nprocedures that allowed the Defendants to retain the Plaintiff's confidential and valuable \ninformation for a period of up to five years, and possibly longer.  \n50.  Such  minimization  procedures  were  kept  secret  from  the  Plaintiff  until \nrecently.   \n51.

The only issue  \nis:  has Plaintiff plausibly shown, under the factual-challenge-to-standing paradigm (as opposed \nto facial), that the government captured his information through dragnet-type data collection. \n  The Circuit Court specifically held that Plaintiff’s “alleged facts − even if proven – \ndo not conclusively establish that PRISM operates as a dragnet on the scale he has alleged.”  \nDoc. 38 at 31.  The Court acknowledged that the “[s]everal commentators and . . . few courts” \nto “have examined PRISM appear to agree with the Government’s view of the program’s \n‘targeted’ nature.”  Id. at 32-33.  It envisioned the government renewing its standing-challenge, \nthis time factually as opposed to facially; and it raised the prospect of jurisdictional discovery, \nand the relevant-considerations attendant thereto. \n  Rather than engage in jurisdictional discovery, the parties agreed that the government \nwould make an informal informational-disclosure; and Plaintiff contemplated that he might be \n\nthus-satisfied, rendering additional litigation unnecessary.  Ultimately, however, Plaintiff \nremained unconvinced, and Defendants have renewed their Motion to Dismiss. \n  Nowhere in opposition does Plaintiff complain that he was denied a fair opportunity to \nmarshal evidence to contradict the government’s record.  Rather, he has enlisted the efforts of \ntwo purported “experts,” Messrs. Binney and Wiebe (who are no strangers to this litigation).  \nThese individuals have not worked for the NSA since 2001, and their affidavits rely on the same \ncategories of materials that already were before the District and Circuit Courts the first time \naround. \n  A current evaluation of Plaintiff’s claims is heavily-influenced by the context and legal \nframework now applicable.  Given that the standing-inquiry has shifted from a facial challenge \nto a factual one, Plaintiff carries the burden, and the standard is a preponderance-of-the-evidence.   \nACE Amer. Ins. Co. v. Guerriero, 738 Fed. Appx. 72, 76 (3d Cir. June 20, 2018); accord \nGBForefront, L.P. v. Forefront Mgmt. Grp., LLC, 888 F.3d 29, 35 (3d Cir. 2018) (cited and \nrelied upon in ACE American). \n  Defendants have shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the government did not \nengage in dragnet-type collection activity – as discussed by the Circuit Court − thereby \nestablishing a plausible claim that Plaintiff’s data was captured.  In support of this conclusion, \nthe Court incorporates by reference, as if fully restated, the evidence and arguments recited in \nDefendants’ opening and reply briefs (Docs. 58 & 73). \n  The court need not delve into the niceties of the various individual evidentiary-challenges \nraised by Defendants, as relates to Plaintiff’s materials.  Even permitting all of Plaintiff’s \nevidence − which, by the time of his current briefing, is restricted to the recent affidavits of \n2 \n \n\nMessrs. Binney and Wiebe1 – Defendant’s positions carry the day under the preponderance-of-\nthe evidence standard (a conclusion that should not be entirely surprising, given the language of \nthe Circuit Court’s Opinion). \n  This Court sees little benefit to rehashing the arguments and factual recitations in \nDefendants’ briefing, which are meticulous and already have been incorporated by reference.  \nThe Court does offer, though, these additional overarching observations.  Plaintiff’s new \naffidavits, in large part, rely on the same underlying evidence already before this Court and the \nCircuit.  What new documents are referenced − even assuming their authenticity and \nadmissibility – do not tip the scales under the preponderance of the evidence standard.  \nSee Defs.’ Reply (Doc. 73) at 3-4 (explaining why the new documents still do not demonstrate \ndragnet-collection, as alleged by Plaintiff).  More generally, the notion that Plaintiff can take \nlargely the same evidence; filter it through the mouthpiece of purported experts (with modest \nembellishment); and hope to satisfy his burdens under the presently-applicable standards; \nseems rather weak tea, given the Circuit Court’s discussions. \n  While this Court questions-not Plaintiff’s sincerity and passion, his post-remand efforts, \ncandidly, are somewhat underwhelming.  Perhaps the limitations say less of Plaintiff’s efforts \nthan an inconvenient-reality – in light of the record now before the Court, PRISM has not been \nshown to be the dragnet-type collection mechanism suggested.  There really is not much more to \nbe said. \n  The Court appreciates the candor and reasonableness with which Plaintiff has approached \nthe remand.  See discussion supra (noting Plaintiff’s willingness to keep an open mind regarding \n                                                 \n1  See Pl.’s Opp’n Br. (Doc. 68) at 10-11 (declining to resist Defendants’ arguments regarding the \nnon-competence of evidence “previously filed in this case,” because Plaintiff now is relying on \nhis “two new affidavits”) (emphasis in original). \n3 \n \n\ncontinued-pursuit of this litigation, depending on what the government ultimately presented).  \nHopefully, he can close this chapter feeling that his civic-duty has been met, to the fullest of his \nabilities; and that his overall objectives have been achieved.  Cf. Defs.’ Br. (Doc. 58) at 10 \n(by the time of remand, Plaintiff’s claims regarding the bulk collection of telephone metadata \nwere mooted by the passage of the USA FREEDOM Act; he had no claim for money damages; \nand all that remained was his claim for injunctive relief based on the government’s alleged bulk \ncollections under PRISM).2 \n  For all of the reasons stated herein, Defendants’ renewed Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 57) \nis GRANTED, and a judgment order under Rule 58 will issue contemporaneously herewith. \n  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \nFebruary 4, 2019          s/Cathy Bissoon     \n              Cathy Bissoon \n              United States District Judge \n \ncc (via ECF email notification): \n \nAll Counsel of Record \n                                                 \n2  This Court takes comfort in knowing that the legislature has imposed measures of \naccountability, as relates to the programs-in-question, including PRISM.

MEMORANDUM \n  Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 20) will be granted. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n  This action is one of several lawsuits arising from recent public revelations that the \nUnited States government, through the National Security Agency (“NSA”), and in conjunction \nwith various telecommunications and internet companies, has been collecting data concerning \nthe telephone and internet activities of American citizens located within the United States.  \nThe Plaintiff, Elliott J. Schuchardt (“Schuchardt”), alleges that the NSA’s bulk data collection \nprograms violate the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution by allowing the \ngovernment to seize and search records related to the telephone and internet activities of ordinary \nAmerican citizens without demonstrating probable cause.  He also asserts claims based on the \nFirst Amendment, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”) and Pennsylvania \ncommon law.  He seeks declaratory and injunctive relief as well as civil liability pursuant to \n18 U.S.C. § 1810. \n \n \n \n\nBACKGROUND \nIn order to properly contextualize the factual claims in this litigation, a brief overview of \nseveral pertinent statutes is warranted.  In 1978, Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, 50 U.S.C. §§1801 et seq. (“FISA”), to “authorize and regulate certain \ngovernmental electronic surveillance of communications for foreign intelligence purposes.”  \nClapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, -- U.S. --, 133 S. Ct. 1138, 1143 (2013).  FISA provided a \nprocedure for the federal government to legally obtain domestic electronic surveillance related to \nforeign targets, see 50 U.S.C. §§ 1804(a)(3) & 1805(a)(2), and created an Article III court – \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (“FISC”) – with jurisdiction “to hear applications for \nand grant orders approving” such surveillance.  50 U.S.C. §1803(a)(1). \nIn the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2011, Congress passed the USA \nPATRIOT Act, Pub. L. No. 107-56, § 215, which, inter alia, empowered the FBI to seek \nauthorization from the FISC to “require[e] the production of any tangible things (including \nbooks, records, papers, documents, and other items) for an investigation . . . to protect against \ninternational terrorism.”  50 U.S.C. 1861(a)(1).  Since 2006, the government has relied on this \nprovision “to operate a program that has come to be called ‘bulk data collection,’ namely, \nthe collection, in bulk, of call records produced by telephone companies containing ‘telephony \nmetadata’ – the telephone numbers dialed (incoming and outgoing), times, and durations of \ncalls.”  See Obama v. Klayman, -- F.3d --, 2015 WL 5058403 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 28, 2015) \n(“Klayman II”).  \nIn 2008, Congress amended FISA by way of the FISA Amendments Act (“FAA”), \nPub. L. No. 110-261 (2008).  The pertinent FAA provision, Section 702 of FISA, 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1881a, “supplement[ed] pre-existing FISA authority by creating a new framework under which \n2 \n \n\nthe Government may seek the FISC’s authorization of certain foreign intelligence surveillance \ntargeting . . . non-U.S. persons located abroad.”  Amnesty Int’l, 133 S. Ct. at 1144.  \nThe government relies upon the authority granted by Section 702 to collect internet data and \ncommunications through a program called “PRISM.”  2d Am. Compl. (Doc. 19) ¶¶ 33, 35. \nAmerican citizens first learned of the government’s bulk data collection programs \nthrough a series of articles published in The Guardian, a British newspaper, in June 2013.  Id.  \nEach article relied on leaked documents provided by a former NSA government contractor, \nEdward Snowden.  Id. ¶¶ 24-27, 33-39.  The first of these articles, published on June 5, 2013, \nrevealed a leaked order from the FISC directing Verizon Business Network Services, Inc. \n(“Verizon Business”) to produce “call detail records or ‘telephony metadata’” to the NSA for all \ntelephone calls made through its systems within the United States (including entirely-domestic \ncalls).  Id. ¶ 33.  Shortly thereafter, the government acknowledged that the FISC order was \ngenuine and that it was part of a broader program of bulk collection of telephone metadata.  \nId. ¶ 34; ACLU v. Clapper, 785 F.3d 787, 796 (2d Cir. 2015). \nThe following day, June 6, 2013, The Guardian published a second article detailing the \nmanner in which the PRISM collection program was used to intercept, access and store e-mail \nand other internet data created by United States citizens using large internet companies, such as \nYahoo, Google, Facebook, Dropbox and Apple.  Id. ¶¶ 35-38.  According to the leaked \ndocuments, the government began collecting information from, inter alia, Yahoo on March 12, \n2008; from Google on January 14, 2009; from Facebook on June 3, 2009; and from Apple in \nOctober 2012.  Id. ¶ 39.  Discussing the scope of the government’s data collection abilities, \nSnowden, in a series of public statements and interviews, averred that he could search, seize, \n3 \n \n\nand read anyone’s electronic communications at any time from his desk during his time working \nwith the NSA.  Id. ¶¶ 45-46. \nSince those revelations, several former NSA employees and whistleblowers have stepped \nforward to supply further details concerning the scope and breadth of the government’s data \ncollection programs.1  William Binney, a former senior employee of the NSA, stated that the \nNSA used a computer program to collect and search domestic internet traffic, a process known as \n“data-mining.”  Id. ¶¶ 9, 19.  Mark Klein, a former AT&T technician, revealed that the NSA was \ncopying e-mail communications on AT&T’s network by means of a secret facility set up in \nSan Francisco.  Id. ¶ 13.  Thomas Drake, another NSA employee, asserted that the NSA has \nbeen, or may be, obtaining the ability to seize and store “most electronic communications.”  \nId. ¶ 20.  A third former NSA employee, Kirk Wiebe, corroborated the allegations made by \nDrake and Binney.  Id. ¶ 21. \n  Based on the averments above, as well as various public interviews conducted by \nSnowden, Schuchardt alleges that the NSA is collecting and storing “massive quantities of e-mail \nand other data created by United States citizens.”  Id. ¶ 36.  Because he utilizes several major \ninternet and telecommunications companies – including Gmail, Google, Yahoo, Dropbox, \nFacebook and Verizon Wireless – Schuchardt contends that the government must, therefore, \nbe “unlawfully intercepting, accessing, monitoring and/or storing the private communications of \nthe Plaintiff, made or stored through such services.”  Id. ¶¶ 86-87.  This presumption underpins \neach of Plaintiff’s claims, and he purports to represent a “nationwide class” of “American  \ncitizens” similarly-situated.  Id. at ¶ 76. \n   \n                                                 \n1  Schuchardt has borrowed the majority of his allegations from affidavits filed in another \nlawsuit, Jewel v. N.S.A., 2015 WL 545925 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 10, 2015). \n4 \n \n\nANALYSIS \nResolution of the instant Motion turns entirely on the issue of standing.  In order to \nestablish standing to sue, a plaintiff must show that he has suffered a “concrete and \nparticularized” injury.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992).  For an \ninjury to be sufficiently particularized, the plaintiff must allege “such a personal stake in the \noutcome of the controversy as to warrant his invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.”  Summers \nv. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009) (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis in \noriginal).  An abstract, generalized grievance that is “common [to] all members of the public” \nwill not suffice.  Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208, 220 (1974). \nThe crux of the government’s Motion is that Schuchardt lacks standing because he has \nnot plausibly alleged that the government has ever collected any of his communications.  In other \nwords, even if data-collection has occurred, Schuchardt has provided no facts demonstrating that \nhe is “among the injured.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 563. \nSeveral recent decisions have addressed the issue of standing in the context of the \ngovernment’s bulk data-collection programs.  In Amnesty International v. Clapper, the United \nStates Supreme Court addressed a challenge to the constitutionality of Section 702 brought by a \ngroup of plaintiffs who alleged that their communications were likely among those intercepted \nbecause they regularly communicated with foreign persons who were probable targets of \ngovernment surveillance.  Amnesty Int’l., 133 S. Ct. at 1145.  Although the plaintiffs had no \nspecific knowledge as to how the government’s targeting practices worked, they provided \nevidence that:  they had engaged in communications that fell within the purview of Section 702; \nthat the government had a strong motive to intercept those communications because of the \nsubject matter and identities involved; that the government had already intercepted large \n5 \n \n\nnumbers of calls and emails involving a specific individual who communicated regularly with \nthe plaintiffs; and that the government had the capacity to intercept the aforementioned \ncommunications.  Id. at 1157-59.  The Court held that these allegations were inadequate to \nestablish standing because they relied on a “speculative chain of possibilities” and displayed \n“no actual knowledge” as to whether the plaintiffs ever were specifically targeted.  Id. at 1148.2 \nIn ACLU v. Clapper, a group of current and former Verizon Business customers \nchallenged the government’s data collection program based on several FISC orders that had been \ndeclassified by the government.  Clapper, 785 F.3d 787, 796 (2d Cir. 2015).  The Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit concluded that the plaintiffs had standing because the \ngovernment’s “own orders demonstrate[ed] that [plaintiffs’] call records are indeed among those \ncollected as part of the telephone metadata program.”  Id. at 801.  The court observed: \n[Plaintiffs’] alleged injury requires no speculation whatsoever as to how \nevents will unfold under § 215 – [plaintiffs’] records (among those of \nnumerous others) have been targeted for seizure by the government; \nthe government has used the challenged statute to effect that seizure; \nthe orders have been approved by the FISC; and the records have been \ncollected. \n \n \nId. at 801-802. \nThe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reached the same conclusion in Jewel v. \nNational Security Agency, a challenge to the NSA’s bulk data-collection program brought by a \ngroup of current and former subscribers to AT&T’s telephone and/or internet services.  Jewel v. \nNational Security Agency, 673 F.3d 902, 906 (9th Cir. 2011).  The plaintiffs relied heavily on \nallegations from a former AT&T employee that the government had created a secure room at an \nAT&T facility in San Francisco for the purpose of monitoring the internet and telephone \n                                                 \n2  Unlike the instant case, Amnesty International did not involve allegations that the government \nhas relied on Section 702 to collect and store entirely-domestic communications.  \n6 \n \n\nactivities of all AT&T customers.  Id.  The named plaintiff, Jewel, alleged that she was \nspecifically affected because AT&T “diverted all of her internet traffic into ‘SG3 Secure Rooms’ \nin AT&T facilities all over the country, including AT&T’s Folsom Street facility in San \nFrancisco, ‘and information of interest [was] transmitted from the equipment in the SG3 Secure \nRooms to the NSA based on rules programmed by the NSA.’”  Id.  The district court dismissed \non standing grounds, concluding that the complaint lacked “allegations specifically linking any \nof the plaintiffs to the alleged surveillance activities.”  Id. at 907. \nThe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that Jewel had alleged a \nsufficiently concrete and particularized injury based on her “highly specific” allegations \nconcerning the operation of the alleged surveillance operation.  The court noted that the \ncomplaint “described in detail the particular electronic communications equipment used (‘4ESS \nswitch’ and ‘WorldNet Internet Room’) at the particular AT&T facility (Folsom Street, San \nFrancisco) where Jewel’s personal and private communications were allegedly intercepted in a \nsecret room known as the ‘SG3 Secure Room.’”  Id. at 910 (internal quotations omitted).  \nThe court emphasized that the specificity of Jewel’s allegations heavily influenced its decision: \nSignificantly, Jewel alleged with particularity that her communications \nwere part of the dragnet.  The complaint focused on AT&T and was not \na scattershot incorporation of all major telecommunications companies \nor a blanket policy challenge.  Jewel’s complaint also honed in on \nAT&T’s Folsom Street facility, through which all of Jewel’s \ncommunications allegedly passed and were captured. \n \n \nId. (first emphasis in original, second added). \nAnother recent decision, Klayman v Obama, involved a challenge to the bulk \ndata-collection program brought by users of Verizon Wireless telecommunications services.  \nThe plaintiffs argued that they had standing based on an FISC order targeting Verizon Business \n7 \n \n\n(an entity distinct from Verizon Wireless) and by virtue of the sheer scope of the government’s \ndata collection efforts.  Klayman, 957 F.Supp.2d at 26-27.  The district court agreed, opining that \nthe government’s attempt to “create a comprehensive metadata database” meant that it \n“must have collected metadata from Verizon Wireless, the single largest wireless carrier in the \nUnited States, as well as AT&T and Sprint, the second and third-largest carriers.”  Id. at 27 \n(emphasis in original).  The court granted a preliminary injunction barring the government from \nany further data collection.  Id. at 43. \nOn review, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia vacated the preliminary \ninjunction and remanded with instructions for the district court to consider whether a limited \nperiod of jurisdictional discovery was appropriate.  Klayman II, 2015 WL 5058403, at *3.  \nIn a decision featuring separate opinions from each of the three judges, the panel agreed that the \ndistrict court had erred in granting the preliminary injunction, but disagreed as to whether the \nplaintiffs had established standing.  Id. \nWriting first, Judge Janice Brown emphasized that the plaintiffs had provided \n“specific evidence that the government operate[d] a bulk-telephony metadata program that \ncollects subscriber information from domestic telecommunications providers, including Verizon \nBusiness Network Services.”  Id. at *4.  She agreed with the district court that, in order to create \na database of any appreciable value, the government must also necessarily collect metadata from \nlarge carriers such as Verizon Wireless.  Id.  Relying on this inference, Judge Brown held that \nthe plaintiffs had “barely fulfilled the requirements for standing at this threshold stage” \nbut “[fell] short of meeting the higher burden of proof required for a preliminary injunction.”  Id. \nJudge Stephen Williams agreed that the plaintiffs were not entitled to preliminary relief, \nand also questioned whether they had satisfied their burden as to standing.  He noted that the \n8 \n \n\n“[p]laintiffs’ contention that the government is collecting data from Verizon Wireless . . . \ndepends entirely on an inference from the existence of the bulk collection program itself.  Such a \nprogram would be ineffective, they say, unless the government were collecting metadata from \nevery large carrier such as Verizon Wireless; ergo it must be collecting such data.”  Id. at *5.  \nJudge Williams observed that this type of speculative inference concerning the government’s \ncapabilities was “no stronger than the [Amnesty International] plaintiffs’ assertions regarding the \ngovernment’s motive and capacity to target their communications.”  Id. at *7.  He concluded that \nplaintiffs had “failed to demonstrate a ‘substantial likelihood’ that the government is collecting \n[data] from Verizon Wireless” or that plaintiffs “are otherwise suffering any cognizable injury.”  \nId. at *8.  Nonetheless, Judge Williams joined Judge Brown in recommending that the matter be \nremanded for jurisdictional discovery.  Id. \nThe third member of the panel, Judge David Sentelle, concluded that the case should be \ndismissed entirely: \n[P]laintiffs never in any fashion demonstrate that the government is or \nhas been collecting . . . records from their telecommunications provider, \nnor that it will do so.  Briefly put, and discussed in more detail by Judge \nWilliams, plaintiffs’ theory is that because it is a big collection and they \nuse a big carrier, the government must be getting at their records.  \nWhile this may be a better-than-usual conjecture, it is nonetheless no \nmore than conjecture. \n \nAs Judge Williams further notes, “[Amnesty International] represents the \nSupreme Court’s most recent evaluation of comparable inferences and \ncuts strongly against plaintiffs’ claim that they have a substantial \nlikelihood of prevailing as to standing.”  While [Amnesty International] \ninvolved collection under a different statutory authorization, the standing \nclaims of the plaintiffs before us and the plaintiffs in that case are \nmarkedly similar.  In fact, the plaintiffs’ claim before us is weaker than \nthat of the [Amnesty International] plaintiffs.  [They] at least claimed \nthat the government had previously targeted them or someone with \nwhom they were communicating.  The plaintiffs before us make no such \nclaim. \n \n9 \n \n\n    *  *  *  *  *  *  * \n \nPlaintiffs have not demonstrated that they suffer injury from the \ngovernment’s collection of records.  They have certainly not shown an \n“injury in fact” that is “actual or imminent, not conjectural or \nhypothetical.” . . .  I therefore would vacate the preliminary injunction as \nhaving been granted without jurisdiction by the district court, and I \nwould remand the case, not for further proceedings, but for dismissal. \n \n \nId. at *9-10. \nIn reviewing the foregoing decisions, a meaningful distinction emerges.  In situations \nwhere plaintiffs are able to allege with some degree of particularity that their own \ncommunications were specifically targeted – for example, by citing a leaked FISC order or \nrelying on a detailed insider account – courts have concluded that the particularity requirement \nhas been satisfied.  See Clapper, 785 F.3d at 801 (noting that the plaintiffs were specifically \ntargeted by an FISC order and that their data was unquestionably collected); Jewel, 673 F.3d \nat 910 (“Significantly, Jewel alleged with particularity that her communications were part of the \ndragnet.”) (emphasis in original).  On the other hand, courts have refused to find standing based \non naked averments that an individual’s communications must have been seized because the \ngovernment operates a data collection program and the individual utilized the service of a large \ntelecommunications company or companies.  See Amnesty Int’l, 133 S. Ct. at 1148 (holding that \nclaims based on a “speculative chain of possibilities” are insufficient); Klayman II, 2015 WL \n5058403, at *5-10 (criticizing plaintiffs’ reliance on conjecture to attempt to establish standing). \nSchuchardt falls squarely within the second category.  In reliance on publicly available \ninformation, only, he has outlined government programs aimed at the wide-scale collection of \ncommunications data.  He also alleges – again, based on media reports and other publicly-\n10 \n \n\navailable information – that the government may have the capability to collect telephone, \nemail and internet traffic from every American citizen.  \nUnlike in Jewel and ACLU, Schuchardt has identified no facts from which the Court \nreasonably might infer that his own communications have been targeted, seized or stored.  As his \npleadings so much as admit, he is indistinguishable from every other American subscribing to \nthe services of a major telephone and/or internet service provider.3  Schuchardt’s only \ndiscernable distinction is his heightened personal-interest in the subject, and, while his \ncivicmindedness may be laudable in other contexts, is insufficient to confer standing.  See Jewel \nat 910 (rejecting sufficiency of “scattershot” allegations encompassing “all major \ntelecommunications companies” and/or “a blanket policy challenge” made in the absence of \npersonal standing); see also Schlesinger, 418 U.S. at 220 (generalized grievances “common [to] \nall members of the public” do not confer standing). \nFor all of the reasons stated above, the Court hereby enters the following: \n \nII.  ORDER \n  Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 20) is GRANTED. \n \nSeptember 30, 2015          s\\Cathy Bissoon     \n              Cathy Bissoon \n              United States District Judge \n \ncc (via ECF email notification): \n \nAll Counsel of Record \n                                                 \n3  Cf. discussion supra (highlighting Plaintiff’s class-allegations, purporting to represent \n“a nationwide” class of all “American citizens” who are subscribers of several major internet \nservice providers, and Verizon). \n11 \n ",

In sum, the Second Amended Complaint reprises the allegations and \nclaims already set forth in Plaintiff’s prior complaints, and to them adds (1) new “background” \nallegations about NSA intelligence-gathering activities made in another pending case, see 2d \nAm. Compl. ¶¶ 1-23; (2) class action allegations, id. ¶¶ 76-84; and (3) a new claim alleging \nviolation of the First Amendment, id. ¶¶ 132-39.  Plaintiff’s prior claims and allegations remain \nlegally deficient for the reasons explained in the Government’s Brief in Support of Defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss (ECF No. 6) (“Gov’t Br.”), and Brief in Support of Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint (ECF No. 14) (“Gov’t 2d Br.”), which are \nincorporated herein by reference.  For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiff’s new claim and \nallegations also fail to establish his entitlement to any relief.  Accordingly, the Second Amended \nComplaint must also be dismissed.  \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FAILS TO ESTABLISH \n   PLAINTIFF’S STANDING.  \n \n  As the Government demonstrated in support of its motions to dismiss Plaintiff’s two prior \niterations of his complaint, Gov’t Br. at 9-12; Gov’t 2d Br. at 5-10, neither contained well-\npleaded allegations of fact “that affirmatively and plausibly suggest” that Plaintiff’s online \ncommunications have ever been acquired under the NSA’s PRISM program, or that records \nabout his telephone calls have ever been collected under the NSA’s bulk telephony metadata \nprogram.  See In re Schering Plough Corp. Intron/Temodar Consumer Class Action, 678 F.3d \n235, 243-44 (3d Cir. 2012), citing Ashcraft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  Plaintiff \npredicates his standing to challenge these foreign-intelligence programs on the claim that the \n1 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 21   Filed 12/11/14   Page 7 of 18\nNSA collects the online communications, and records about the telephone calls, of all \nAmericans, including, therefore, his.  But notwithstanding the new wave of “background” \nallegations he has added to the complaint, 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 1-23, Plaintiff still has not \nplausibly alleged this to be the case. \n  Principally, Plaintiff embellishes his own allegations with claims made by the plaintiffs \n(and several of their declarants) in Jewel v. NSA, 08-cv-4373 (JSW) (N.D. Cal.).  2d Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 8-23.  Jewel is a self-described “challenge[ to] an [alleged] illegal and unconstitutional \nprogram of dragnet communications surveillance conducted by the [NSA] and other Defendants \n….”  Jewel, Complaint for Constitutional & Statutory Violations (ECF No. 1) (“Jewel Compl.”) \n¶ 2.  Plaintiff incorporates into his complaint the allegation in Jewel that the NSA uses a \n“nationwide network of … surveillance devices” “to acquire the content of a significant portion \nof the phone calls, emails … and other [online] communications … of practically every \nAmerican who uses the phone system or the Internet ….”  Id. ¶¶ 8, 9; see 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 15.   \n  But the Jewel complaint (like Plaintiff’s) lacks the “factual enhancement” required to \nsupport this “naked assertion,” and it is therefore not entitled to the presumption of truth.  Iqbal, \n556 U.S. at 678, 681; Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 554-55 (2007).  The Jewel \ncomplaint alleges only that the NSA collects Internet-based communications at AT&T facilities \nlocated in four states—California, Washington, Georgia, and Missouri—and records, stored in \nAT&T databases, that pertain to the telecommunications of AT&T customers.  Jewel Compl. \n¶¶ 55, 68, 82-83.  Regardless of whether the Jewel complaint adequately pleads the standing of \nthe plaintiffs there, who allegedly are AT&T subscribers, see id. ¶¶ 20-24, it contains no well-\npleaded allegations from which it could plausibly be concluded that the NSA collects \ninformation about the telecommunications of “practically every American,” including persons, \nsuch as Plaintiff, who are not subscribers to services provided by AT&T.  See 2d Am. Compl. \n2 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 21   Filed 12/11/14   Page 8 of 18\n¶ 87 (listing telecommunications services to which Plaintiff subscribes).  Plaintiff’s burden here \nis to set forth well-pleaded, non-conclusory allegations of fact that affirmatively and plausibly \nsuggest he has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is traceable to the Government’s \nalleged conduct.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-79; Schering Plough, 678 F.3d at 243-44.  It does him \nno good simply to repeat the conclusory allegations contained in other litigants’ complaints.   \n  Plaintiff also cites the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Jewel v. NSA, 673 F.3d 902 (9th Cir. \n2011), as support for his standing.  2d Am. Compl. ¶ 22.  But that decision is of no assistance to \nPlaintiff because it concerned a standing issue different from the one presented here.  In Jewel \nthe district court dismissed the complaint for lack of standing on the basis that the harm alleged \nby the plaintiffs was not “sufficiently particular to [them],” and was instead “a generalized \ngrievance shared in substantially equal measure by all or a large class of citizens” — an \nargument the Government had not made.  Jewel v. NSA, 2010 WL 235075, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Jan. \n21, 2010).1  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the injuries asserted by the Jewel plaintiffs \nwere not “abstract, generalized grievances and instead me[t] the constitutional standing \nrequirement of concrete injury,” because (contrary to the district court’s conclusion) the \nplaintiffs’ allegations “‘specifically link[ed] [them] to the alleged surveillance activities.’”  \nJewel, 673 F.3d at 905, 907 (quoting Jewel, 2010 WL 235075, at *5); see id. at 910.   \n  The Government’s motion in this case, however, does not present the question whether \nPlaintiff’s claimed injury is sufficiently concrete and particularized.  The question is whether \nPlaintiff’s claim that he has been injured at all is supported by sufficient well-pleaded and non-\n                                                 \n  1  See Hollingsworth v. Perry, 133 S. Ct. 2652, 2662 (2013) (explaining that “raising only \na generally available grievance about government—claiming only harm to [the plaintiff’s] and \nevery citizen’s interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that \nno more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large”—does not state a \nconcrete and particularized injury that confers Article III standing) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 573-74 (1992)); Lance v. Coffman, 549 U.S. 437, 439 (2007). \n3 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 21   Filed 12/11/14   Page 9 of 18\nconclusory allegations of fact to meet the plausibility requirement of Iqbal and Schering Plough.  \nThe answer is no, because neither Plaintiff’s own allegations, nor those he has imported from \nJewel, plausibly link him to the alleged intelligence-gathering activities he purports to challenge.  \nSee Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 563 (Article III requires “that the party seeking [judicial] \nreview” of allegedly unlawful conduct “be himself among the injured”).2 \n  The declarations that Plaintiff cites from the Jewel case also fail to establish that critical \nlink, as none of them supports the allegation that the NSA collects information about the \ntelecommunications of all Americans.  Plaintiff cites the statement of former NSA employee \nWilliam Binney that, following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, he “learned” that the \nNSA had begun using a “data-min[ing] program” to “collect and analyze domestic e-mail, \nwithout a warrant.”  2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 9-12, 19; see Jewel, Declaration of William E. Binney \n(ECF No. 88) (“Binney Decl.”) ¶¶ 5-6.  But nothing in these allegations—which are based on \nhearsay (see Binney Decl. ¶ 5)—even purports to describe the scope or scale of these supposed \nsurveillance activities, or supports the conclusion that they involved collection of information \nabout all Americans’ communications. \n  In addition to the Binney Declaration, Plaintiff cites the declarations of two other former \nNSA employees, Jewel, Declaration of J. Kirk Wiebe (ECF No. 86) (“Wiebe Decl.”); id., \nDeclaration of Thomas A. Drake (ECF No. 87) (“Drake Decl.”); see 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 20, 21, \nwho express agreement with Mr. Binney’s assertion that the NSA today “has the capability to \nseize and store most electronic communications passing through its U.S. intercept centers,” \nwhich Mr. Binney “estimate[s]” to number between ten and twenty.  Binney Decl. ¶¶ 7-9; Wiebe \n                                                 \n  2  Whether the Jewel plaintiffs can prove their standing as a matter of fact, and can do so \nwithout risking or requiring impermissible disclosures of national security information protected \nby the state secrets privilege, remains the subject of ongoing proceedings in that case.  See, e.g., \nJewel, Gov’t Defs.’ Opp. to Pls.’ Mot. for Partial Summ. Judg. & Cross-Mot. for Partial Summ. \nJudg. on Pls.’ Fourth Am. Claim (ECF No. 286-6) at 20-23. \n4 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 21   Filed 12/11/14   Page 10 of 18\nDecl. ¶ 8; Drake Decl. ¶ 8.  They also agree with Mr. Binney’s conclusion, based on media \nreports about the anticipated capacity of new NSA digital storage facilities, that the NSA “is, in \nfact, storing all [the electronic communications] that they are collecting.”  Binney Decl. ¶¶ 11-\n13; Wiebe Decl. ¶ 9; Drake Decl. ¶ 9.  But by the time these gentlemen executed their \ndeclarations in June 2012, they had not been employed by the NSA for years—in the cases of \nMessrs. Binney and Wiebe, for more than a decade—see Binney Decl. ¶ 6; Wiebe Decl. Exh. A \nat 2; Drake Decl. Exh. A at 2, and could only speculate about the nature, scope, and focus of the \nNSA’s current intelligence-gathering activities.  The Supreme Court has made clear that \nspeculation about the scope and operation of the Government’s foreign-intelligence surveillance \nprograms will not support a finding, for standing purposes, that a litigant has been a subject of \nsuch surveillance.  Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 133 S. Ct. 1138, 1147-51 (2013).  Moreover, \neven assuming the NSA were “stor[ing] most electronic communications passing through its \nU.S. intercept centers,” nothing in the Binney, Wiebe, and Drake Declarations even purports to \nsuggest what fraction of Americans’ electronic communications passes through the 10-20 \n“intercept centers” whose existence Mr. Binney posits, much less that they intercept the \ncommunications of all Americans, including Plaintiff’s.3 \n  Notwithstanding multiple attempts, Plaintiff still has not set forth well-pleaded, non-\nconclusory allegations from which it could plausibly be concluded that the NSA intelligence-\ngathering activities he purports to challenge involve the collection of information about all \nAmericans’ communications, nor any other non-speculative basis on which it could plausibly be \nconcluded that these activities involve collection of information about his communications.   \n                                                 \n  3  Plaintiff’s class-action allegations, 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 76-84, are immaterial to the \nstanding analysis.  Plaintiff must establish his standing regardless of whether he seeks to litigate \nhis claims individually or on behalf of a class.  Hayes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 725 F.3d 349, \n360-61 (3d Cir. 2013); McNair v. Synapse Group, Inc., 672 F.3d 213, 223-24 (3d Cir. 2012). \n5 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 21   Filed 12/11/14   Page 11 of 18\nPlaintiff therefore cannot establish his Article III standing, and this case must be dismissed for \nlack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Kerchner v. Obama, 612 F.3d 204, 207 (3d Cir. 2010).    \nII.  PLAINTIFF’S FIRST AMENDMENT CLAIM SHOULD BE DISMISSED. \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amendment claim, 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 134-39, asserts that the challenged \nNSA intelligence-gathering programs violate his freedom of speech and association.  Under long \naccepted principles, discussed below, Plaintiff’s First Amendment claim perishes in the wake of \nhis Fourth Amendment claim, which fails for the reasons discussed in the Government’s prior \nbriefs.  See Gov’t Br. at 12-19; Gov’t 2d Br. at 10-19.  Alternatively, even if the Court were to \nhold that Plaintiff’s First Amendment claim could survive dismissal of his Fourth Amendment \nclaim, his allegations would still be insufficient to establish an entitlement to relief for violation \nof his First Amendment rights. \nA.    Good-Faith Investigatory Conduct Not Intended to Deter or Punish \n  Protected Speech or Association Does Not Violate the First Amendment. \n \n  Recognizing the need to accommodate the Government’s interests where prevention of \ncrime, or, even more imperatively, potential threats to national security are concerned, see \nUnited States v. U.S. Dist. Ct. (Keith), 407 U.S. 297, 313 (1972), courts distinguish for purposes \nof First Amendment analysis between government investigations that may have an incidental \neffect of deterring First Amendment activity, and concrete government action of a regulatory, \nproscriptive, or compulsory nature that is directed against individuals based on their expressive \nor associational activities.  See, e.g., Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, 436 U.S. 547, 564 (1978); Laird \nv. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 11 (1972); United States v. Mayer, 503 F.3d 740, 747-53 (9th Cir. 2007); \nRedd v. City of Enter., 140 F.3d 1378, 1383-84 (11th Cir. 1998); Gordon v. Warren Consol. Bd. \nof Educ., 706 F.2d 778, 781 n.3 (6th Cir. 1983) (collecting cases); ACLU v. Barr, 952 F.2d 457, \n471 (D.C. Cir. 1991); Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press v. AT&T, 593 F.2d 1030, 1051-\n6 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 21   Filed 12/11/14   Page 12 of 18\n53 (D.C. Cir. 1978); [Redacted], Dkt. No. PR/TT [redacted], Opinion and Order, 66-69 (F.I.S.C. \n[date redacted]) (attached hereto as Exhibit A). \n  Accordingly, good faith governmental investigations conducted with “scrupulous” \nadherence, Zurcher, 436 U.S. at 564, to Fourth Amendment requirements, without the purpose of \ndeterring or penalizing protected expression or association, do not violate the First Amendment.  \nSee Reporters Comm., 593 F.2d at 1051-53; see also Gordon, 706 F.2d at 781 n.3 \n(“[S]urveillance consistent with Fourth Amendment protections . . . does not violate First \nAmendment rights, even though it may be directed at communicative or associative activities.”); \nACLU v. Clapper, 959 F. Supp. 2d 724, 753 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (concluding that “[t]he \nGovernment’s argument [on this point] is well-supported”).4     \nHere, Plaintiff does not even purport to allege that the challenged NSA programs are \ndirected against him (or any other individuals) based on expressive or associational activities.  \nIndeed, as the court in ACLU recognized, the express terms of Section 215 (under which the bulk \ncollection of telephony metadata is authorized) prohibit the statute’s use for purposes of \ninvestigations “conducted ‘solely on the basis of activities that are protected by the first \namendment,’” 959 F. Supp. 2d at 753 (quoting 50 U.S.C. § 1861(a)(2)(B)), a restriction the FISC \ntakes into account and reinforces each time it re-authorizes the bulk telephony metadata program.  \nSee September 11, 2014, FISC Primary Order (attached hereto as Exhibit B) at 2; id. at 7 n.6, 9 \nn.7 (prohibiting queries of the metadata using selectors chosen “solely on the basis of activities \n                                                 \n  4 The Ninth Circuit has “clarif[ied] that good faith . . . requires” that the “government \ninvestigation” be “justified by a legitimate” purpose that “outweighs any harm to First \nAmendment interests.”  Mayer, 503 U.S. at 753; see also Barr, 952 F.2d at 471 (no “legitimate \npurpose” when “surveill[ing] with the intent of deterring membership in . . . an association \nengaged in lawful activities”).  For the reasons set forth in the text, both the bulk telephony \nmetadata program and the PRISM collection authorized by Section 702 surmount this low bar.  \n7 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 21   Filed 12/11/14   Page 13 of 18\nthat are protected by the First Amendment”).5  And FISA Section 702, under which PRISM \ncollection is conducted, authorizes targeting only of non-U.S. persons reasonably believed to be \nlocated abroad, 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(b), that is, of persons who do not have First Amendment \nrights to begin with, see United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 271 (1990) (“[A]liens \nreceive constitutional protections [only] when they have come within the territory of the United \nStates and developed substantial connections with this country.”). \nIndeed, Plaintiff makes no claim that the bulk telephony metadata program is conducted   \nfor any purpose other than the statutorily authorized objective of obtaining foreign intelligence \ninformation to protect against foreign terrorist attacks, see 50 U.S.C. § 1861(a)(1); September 11, \n2014, Primary Order at 2.  Nor has Plaintiff alleged that targeted PRISM collection of non-U.S. \nperson communications is conducted for any purpose other than the authorized acquisition of \nforeign intelligence information to protect the Nation against such dangers as, for example, \ninternational terrorism, the international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the \nclandestine intelligence activities of foreign powers, see 50 U.S.C. § 1801(e); id. § 1881a(a).  \nThese are not only legitimate Government interests, they represent paramount national security \nconcerns.  Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1, 28 (2010) (“[T]he Government’s \ninterest in combating terrorism is an urgent objective of the highest order.”); Haig v. Agee, 453 \nU.S. 280, 307 (1981) (“[N]o governmental interest is more compelling than the security of the \nNation.”); In re Directives, 551 F.3d 1004, 1012 (FISC Ct. Rev. 2008) (national-security interest \nin conducting acquisitions pursuant to Section 702 “is of the highest order of magnitude”). \n                                                 \n 5  Although Plaintiff’s allegation that the bulk telephony metadata program collects “all \n‘call detail records’ for calls made wholly within the United States,” 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 33, is \nincorrect, see Gov’t 2d Br. at 9, it underscores the point that Plaintiff does not and, due to the \nprogram’s scale, cannot suggest that the program singles him out in any way, let alone on the \nbasis of his expressive or associational activity.   \n8 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 21   Filed 12/11/14   Page 14 of 18\nBecause Plaintiff has not plausibly alleged that these intelligence-gathering programs \nviolate his Fourth Amendment rights, see Gov’t Br. at 12-19; Gov’t 2d Br. at 10-19, nor alleged \nat all (plausibly or otherwise) that the purposes of these programs include the suppression of free \nexpression or association, supra, at 7-8, he has failed to state a claim that either of the challenged \nprograms violates the First Amendment.6 \n  B.  Plaintiff’s First Amendment Claim Must Also Be Dismissed for Failure to  \n    Allege a Direct and Substantial Burden on his Freedom of Speech or    \n    Association. \n \nEven if the Court concluded that Plaintiff’s First Amendment claim could in theory \nsurvive dismissal of his Fourth Amendment claim, his First Amendment claim would still fail for \nthe independent reason that he has not alleged a direct and substantial burden on his freedom of \nspeech or association.  Rather, Plaintiff’s allegations amount at most to a subjective “chill” on \nhis First Amendment freedoms, arising solely from speculative fears that are based on his \n(mis)understanding of the challenged NSA programs rather than their actual operation.  These \nmisplaced fears are an insufficient basis on which to bring a First Amendment claim. \n “[C]onsonant with the First Amendment,” the Government “may engage” in conduct that \n“incidentally inhibits protected forms of association,” which, though it may “make it more \n                                                 \n6  The Supreme Court’s decision in Keith is not to the contrary.  In that case, the Court \naddressed the constitutionality of warrantless surveillance targeting “domestic organizations” \nthat sought to “attack and subvert” the Government.  Keith, 407 U.S. at 299-300.  In finding that \nprior judicial approval for such surveillance was necessary, id. at 321, the Court expressed \nparticular concern that “domestic security surveillance” might infringe on “constitutionally \nprotected privacy of speech” “because of the inherent vagueness of the domestic security \nconcept, the necessarily broad and continuing nature of intelligence gathering, and the temptation \nto utilize such surveillances to oversee political dissent.”  Id. at 320.  The concerns that animated \nthe Keith Court are not implicated by the telephony metadata program or PRISM collection, \nbecause, as explained above, Sections 215 and 702 authorize only the collection of foreign \nintelligence, and their terms prohibit, either expressly, or in effect, the investigation of persons \nsolely on the basis of activities protected by the First Amendment.  See Keith, 407 U.S. at 321-22 \n(“emphasiz[ing]” that the “scope of [its] decision” addressed only the “domestic aspects of \nnational security” and did “not address[]” the “issues which may be involved with respect to \nactivities of foreign powers or their agents”). \n9 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 21   Filed 12/11/14   Page 15 of 18\ndifficult for individuals to exercise their freedom of association, this consequence does not, \nwithout more, result in a violation of the First Amendment.”  Fighting Finest, Inc. v. Bratton, 95 \nF.3d 224, 228 (2d Cir. 1996) (citing Lyng v. UAW, 485 U.S. 360, 366 (1988)); see also Reporters \nComm., 593 F.2d at 1052 (“Not every Government action that affects, has an impact on, or \nindeed inhibits First Amendment activity constitutes the kind of ‘abridgement’ condemned by \nthe First Amendment.”).  “Mere incidental burdens on the right to associate do not violate the \nFirst Amendment.”  Tabbaa v. Chertoff, 509 F.3d 89, 101 (2d Cir. 2007); ACLU, 959 F. Supp. \n2d at 753 (stating same in finding that the “bulk [telephony] metadata collection does not burden \nFirst Amendment rights substantially”).  Rather, “[t]o be cognizable, the interference with \nassociational rights must be ‘direct and substantial’ or ‘significant.’”  Fighting Finest, Inc., 95 \nF.3d at 228 (quoting Lyng, 485 U.S. at 366, 367 & n.5).   \n  Plaintiff’s allegations of a violation of his free-speech and associational rights do not \nmeet this standard.  Plaintiff claims that he is “no longer able to freely express himself by means \nof e-mail or in documents stored by means of internet cloud services because the Defendants are \ncollecting and data-mining such documents.”  2d Am. Compl. ¶ 136.  He maintains also that the \nDefendants have “interfered with [his] ability to freely associate with other persons” because the \nDefendants have obtained “phone and internet data showing with whom [he] associates.”  Id. \n¶ 138.  These allegations fail to state a claim that the Government has burdened Plaintiff’s First \nAmendment rights at all, much less in a “direct” and “substantial” manner, first because they are \npredicated on the assumption that the challenged NSA intelligence programs involve interception \nof Plaintiff’s electronic communications, and acquisition of metadata associated with Plaintiff’s  \ntelephone calls.  As discussed above and in the Government’s prior briefs, Plaintiff has not \n10 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 21   Filed 12/11/14   Page 16 of 18\nplausibly alleged that to be the case.  See supra, at 2-5; Gov’t Br. at 9-12; Gov’t 2d Br. at 5-10.7  \nPlaintiff’s “bare assertions,” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 681, in his First Amendment claim that the \nGovernment is “collecting and data-mining” his online documents, and has obtained “phone and \ninternet data showing with whom [he] associates,’” 2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 136, 138, are just as \nunaccompanied by “factual matter” raising them “above the speculative level” as are the similar \n“background” allegations set forth in his complaint.  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555-56.8   \nSecond, claims that Plaintiff “is no longer able to freely express himself” or “freely \nassociate with other persons,” simply because of a fear that the Government might obtain or \n“data-mine” information about his communications, are insufficient to state a claim for direct \nand substantial interference with his First Amendment rights.  It is true that a “constitutional \nviolation[] may arise from the deterrent, or ‘chilling,’ effect” of government action that “fall[s] \nshort of a direct prohibition against the exercise of First Amendment rights.”  Laird, 408 U.S. \nat 11.  But the alleged chill on Plaintiff’s First Amendment freedoms is attributable to his own \nspeculative fears of surveillance, rather than being plausibly connected to the challenged \n                                                 \n  7 Even presuming that the Government has collected metadata associated with Plaintiff’s \ntelephone calls under the bulk telephony metadata program, under the FISC’s orders NSA \nanalysts may only review those records within two hops of selectors (e.g., telephone numbers) \nthat the FISC has determined are reasonably suspected of association with terrorist organizations \nthe FISC has approved for targeting.  See September 11 Primary Order at 2, 7-8; Gov’t 2d Br. at \n3, 8-10.  Plaintiff has made no plausible allegation that records of his calls are among the “very \nsmall percentage” of the records that are ever reviewed by NSA analysts under this standard.  \nSee ACLU, 959 F. Supp. 2d at 735.  Hence, the Second Amended Complaint contains no “factual \nmatter” to support Plaintiff’s assertion that the Government learns “with whom [he] associates,” \n2d Am. Compl. ¶ 138, from bulk telephony metadata collected by the NSA.  Twombly, 550 U.S. \nat 555-56; see Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 681. \n8  For this reason, Williams v. Price, 25 F. Supp. 2d 623 (W.D. Pa. 1998), provides no \ncomfort to Plaintiff.  In that case, the court found that the claimed First Amendment right of the \nplaintiff prisoners to confer confidentially with their counsel was chilled by the presence of \ncorrectional officers, stationed outside the meeting room, who could hear what the inmates and \ncounsel were saying inside.  Id. at 624-25, 630.  Here, in contrast, Plaintiff has not plausibly \nalleged that his online communications, or telephony metadata associated with his calls, have \nbeen obtained or reviewed by the Government. \n11 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 21   Filed 12/11/14   Page 17 of 18\nintelligence programs, because, as we have shown, the Second Amended Complaint contains no \nplausible allegations that information about Plaintiff’s communications has been obtained, \nreviewed, or used in any fashion under PRISM or the telephony metadata program.  See supra, at \n2-5; Gov’t Br. at 9-12; Gov’t 2d Br. at 5-8.  “Allegations of a subjective chill” arising from an \n“individual’s knowledge” of the “mere existence, without more, of a governmental investigative \nand data-gathering activity” “are not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific present \nobjective harm or a threat of specific future harm.”  Laird, 408 U.S. at 10, 11, 13-14.9  Such \nallegations are insufficient even to confer standing, much less to state a claim for a First \nAmendment violation.  See Amnesty Int’l, USA, 133 S. Ct. at 1152 (and cases cited therein); \nACLU, 959 F. Supp. 2d at 754 (“Fear that telephony metadata relating to [plaintiffs’ calls] will \nbe queried or reviewed or further investigated ‘relies on a highly attenuated chain of \npossibilities,’” and that “speculative fear” can neither “create standing” nor “establish a violation \nof an individual’s First Amendment rights.”) (quoting Amnesty Int’l, 133 S. Ct. at 1148, 1152).10 \n                                                 \n9  See also Paton v. La Prade, 524 F.2d 862, 874 (3d Cir. 1975) (teacher who designed a \ncourse taken by a student, and who claimed that a resulting FBI investigation of the student \n“constituted an ‘inhibiting force’” on his free expression, suffered only a non-cognizable \n“subjective chill”); Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of Religious Soc’y of Friends v. Tate, 519 F.2d \n1335, 1137-39 (3d Cir. 1975) (plaintiffs suffered only “subjective chill” of First Amendment \nrights arising from police creation of “dossiers” about them based on information gathered from \n“public meetings,” which the police shared with “other law enforcement agencies”; cognizable \ninjury occurred only when police shared dossiers with public or “broadcast” on “network \ntelevision” the names of groups and individuals “on whom such files were kept”); Gross v. \nTaylor, 1997 WL 535872, at *16 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 5, 1997) (“vague charge of chilled expression” \ninsufficient to “sustain” a “First Amendment claim”).   \n  10  Plaintiff’s allegation he could not consult with certain persons by e-mail in preparing \nhis Second Amended Complaint, because “the Defendants could provide such communications \ndirectly to the lawyers representing the [G]overnment in this lawsuit,” 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 137, \nprovides no support for his First Amendment claim.  This allegation is too speculative to satisfy \neither the requirement of actual or imminent injury, see Amnesty Int’l, supra, or the plausibility \nstandard under Iqbal.  That is all the more so considering that both Section 215 and Section 702 \nrequire the Government to adopt minimization procedures “to prohibit the dissemination …of \nnonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting United States persons” except as \n(footnote continued on next page) \n12 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 21   Filed 12/11/14   Page 18 of 18\nAccordingly, Plaintiff’s First Amendment claim, like the other causes of action he has \nattempted to plead, states no violation of legal right entitling him to relief. \nCONCLUSION \n   \n  For the reasons stated above, the Second Amended Complaint should be dismissed. \n \nDated:  December 11, 2014  Respectfully submitted, \n \nJOYCE R.

Schuchardt alleges that the bulk data collection programs of the National \nSecurity Agency (“NSA”) under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”), 50 \nU.S.C. § 1801 et seq., violate the Fourth Amendment because they allow the Government \nto intercept, access, monitor, and store all or substantially all U.S. domestic e-mail \nwithout probable cause.  Pl.’s App. 138–67.  He filed suit in 2014 against the President of \nthe United States, the Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the NSA, and the \nDirector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”).  After the District Court \ndismissed Schuchardt’s suit for lack of facial standing under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(1), we reversed.  See Schuchardt v. President of the U.S. (“Schuchardt \nI”), 839 F.3d 336 (3d Cir. 2016).   \n \n* This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not \nconstitute binding precedent. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 83-2   Filed 04/23/20   Page 3 of 14\nIn a facial attack, we review only “the allegations of the complaint and documents \nreferenced therein and attached thereto, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.”  \nGould Elecs. Inc. v. United States, 220 F.3d 169, 176 (3d Cir. 2000).  However, if the \ndefendant contests the pleaded jurisdictional facts, “the court must permit the plaintiff to \nrespond with evidence supporting jurisdiction.”  Id. at 177 (citing Int’l Ass’n of \nMachinists & Aerospace Workers v. Nw. Airlines, Inc., 673 F.2d 700, 711–12 (3d Cir. \n1982)).    \nOn remand, the District Court held that Schuchardt failed to rebut the evidence the \nGovernment submitted to challenge his factual standing.  We agree and thus affirm the \nDistrict Court’s ruling.   \nA.  Procedural Background   \nSchuchardt specifically alleged that the NSA operates a program known as PRISM \nthrough which it collects “massive quantities of e-mail and other data created by [U.S.] \ncitizens” “directly from the servers” of U.S. service providers like Google, Microsoft, \nYahoo, Facebook, Dropbox, and Apple.  Pl.’s App. 145.  As “a consumer of various \ntypes of electronic communication, storage, and [I]nternet-search services” of those \nservice providers, id. at 156, Schuchardt further asserted that the Government “obtained \ndirect access to the servers” of the providers and was “intercepting, accessing, monitoring \nand/or storing [his] private communications . . . .”  Id. at 145, 156, 158.1   \n \n1 The Government argues that this case is about PRISM and not other programs.  \nGov’t Br. 27–31.  That question was never squarely before the District Court.  Nor is it \nbefore us.  The Government did not argue on remand that Schuchardt was not permitted \nto submit non-PRISM evidence, and in fact itself submitted evidence that goes beyond \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 83-2   Filed 04/23/20   Page 4 of 14\nSchuchardt supplemented his complaint with two categories of exhibits.  First, he \nsubmitted reports from the Washington Post and Guardian newspapers about classified \ndocuments leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, as well as excerpts of the \nmaterials themselves.  These exhibits refer to an NSA program engaged in the bulk \ncollection of domestic e-mail metadata.  Id. at 91–131.  Several of the documents appear \nto be internal NSA slides.  One is titled “Dates When PRISM Collection Began For Each \nProvider,” and lists dates when several service providers began collection.  Another slide, \n“New Collection Posture,” includes slogans such as “Exploit it All.”  Id. at 109–10.   \nThe second category of documents Schuchardt attached contained affidavits filed \nin support of the plaintiffs in Jewel v. NSA, 965 F. Supp. 2d 1090 (N.D. Cal. 2013), a \nseparate case challenging the NSA’s interception of internet traffic.  Id. at 1098.  The \naffidavits were of former NSA employees William E. Binney, Thomas A. Drake, and J. \nKirk Wiebe, who asserted that after September 11, 2001, the agency developed an \nexpansive view of its own surveillance authority.  Pl.’s App. 186–219.  Binney stated that \nhe was the creator of the technology the Government uses today to conduct large-scale \ndata collection, and that members of his team told him the Government implemented \nintelligence activities after September 11 known as the President’s Surveillance Program \nthat involved the collection of domestic e-mails without the privacy protections built into \nother NSA programs.  Id. at 187–88.   \n \nPRISM.  See Gov’t’s Add. A; Gov’t’s Add. B.  Schuchardt correctly points out that his \ncomplaint is broad enough to include programs beyond PRISM.  Schuchardt Reply 12.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 83-2   Filed 04/23/20   Page 5 of 14\nThe District Court dismissed in 2015 Schuchardt’s complaint for lack of standing.  \nA Rule 12(b)(1) motion under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to dismiss for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction may be treated as either a facial or factual challenge.  See \nMortensen v. First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n, 549 F.2d 884, 891 (3d Cir. 1977).   \nThe District Court concluded, for facial challenge purposes, that Schuchardt had \n“identified no facts from which [it] reasonably might infer that [the plaintiff’s] own \ncommunications have been targeted, seized or stored.”  Pl.’s App. 14–24.  As noted, we \nreversed in 2016 and concluded that his allegations “plausibly stated an injury in fact \npersonal to” him “as a facial matter.”  Schuchardt I, 839 F.3d at 338.  Thus we \nconsidered the exhibits Schuchardt submitted and afforded his pleadings the presumption \nof truth.  Though the Government disputed Schuchardt’s allegations and submitted \nevidence, we could not, on a facial attack, consider its submissions.  Id. at 346, 352–53.  \nFinally, we noted that the Government was “free upon remand to make a factual \njurisdictional challenge to Schuchardt’s pleading.”  Id. at 353. \nOn remand, the parties agreed that, rather than engage in discovery as to \njurisdiction, the Government would make an informal information disclosure; if \nSchuchardt was not satisfied, he could resume the litigation.  The District Court directed \nSchuchardt to inform it “whether or not this case w[ould] be dismissed based on the \ninformation provided . . . .”  Pl.’s App. 10.  Thereafter, Schuchardt did not make any \ndiscovery or extension requests.  The Government filed a renewed motion to dismiss, and \nSchuchardt filed a response relying on new affidavits from Binney and Wiebe.  Id. at 63–\n5 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 83-2   Filed 04/23/20   Page 6 of 14\n66.  Schuchardt conceded at oral argument that he did not make any discovery or \nextension requests nor ask for a hearing to qualify Binney and Wiebe as experts.   \nThe District Court issued an order in February 2019 dismissing Schuchardt’s case \nfor lack of standing on a factual challenge.  Pl.’s App. 63.  It concluded that the \nGovernment showed that it “did not engage in dragnet-type collection activity,” and in \nsupport of that conclusion it incorporated “by reference, as if fully restated, the evidence \nand arguments recited in [the Government’s] opening and reply briefs.”  Id. at 64.  \nMoreover, the documents Schuchardt submitted were inadmissible and did not create a \nfactual dispute as to his standing.  The Court went on to state that, “[e]ven permitting all \nof [Schuchardt’s] evidence—which . . . [was] restricted to the recent affidavits of [] \nBinney and Wiebe,” and the documents attached thereto, the Government’s “positions \ncarry the day.”  Id. at 64–65.  Schuchardt’s “post remand efforts” were “underwhelming” \nand merely amounted to taking the same evidence previously before the District Court \nand “filter[ing] it through the mouthpiece of purported experts.”  Id. at 65.2   \nB.  Jurisdiction and Standard of Review  \nThe District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.  We have jurisdiction \nper 28 U.S.C. § 1291.  “When reviewing an order dismissing a claim for lack of subject \nmatter jurisdiction, we exercise plenary review over legal conclusions and review \nfindings of fact for clear error.”  Adorers of the Blood of Christ v. Fed. Energy Reg. \n \n2 Because it incorporated the Government’s briefs in their entirety, we discuss the \nevidence and arguments therein as the Court’s own decision.  We nonetheless note that \nthe wholesale adoption of one side’s briefs is a practice we discourage.  See In re \nComplaint of Luhr Bros., Inc., 157 F.3d 333, 338 (5th Cir. 1998); Walton v. United \nConsumers Club, Inc., 786 F.2d 303, 313–14 (7th Cir. 1986).   \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 83-2   Filed 04/23/20   Page 7 of 14\nComm’n, 897 F.3d 187, 193 (3d Cir. 2018) (citation omitted).  We review the District \nCourt’s evidentiary findings for abuse of discretion.  “In order to justify reversal, a \ndistrict court’s analysis and resulting conclusion must be arbitrary or irrational.”  United \nStates v. Bailey, 840 F.3d 99, 117 (3d Cir. 2016) (citation and quotation marks omitted).3 \nC.  Rule 12(b)(1) Factual Challenge  \nOn a Rule 12(b)(1) factual challenge, the plaintiff has the burden of proof, \nMortensen, 549 F.2d at 891, and the burden of persuasion, Gould Elecs Inc., 220 F.3d at \n178.  Thus “a 12(b)(1) factual challenge strips the plaintiff of the protections and factual \ndeference provided under 12(b)(6) review” for a typical motion to dismiss on the merits, \nHartig Drug Co. Inc. v. Senju Pharm. Co. Ltd., 836 F.3d 261, 268 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(emphasis added) (citation omitted), and under facial 12(b)(1) review, see CNA v. United \nStates, 535 F.3d 132, 139 (3d Cir. 2008). \nIt is true that a “[j]urisdictional finding of genuinely disputed facts is inappropriate \nwhen the jurisdictional issue and substantive issues are so intertwined that the question of \njurisdiction is dependent on the resolution of factual issues going to the merits of an \naction.”  Davis v. Wells Fargo, 824 F.3d 333, 348 (3d Cir. 2016) (citation omitted).  \nWhen a case raises a disputed factual issue that goes both to the merits and jurisdiction, \n \n3 Schuchardt devoted much of his brief to the merits of this case.  Schuchardt Br. \n43–55.  The District Court did not reach the merits, as it dismissed on a Rule 12(b)(1) \nmotion.  Accordingly, we do not consider his arguments as to the merits.  Schuchardt also \ncited for the first time in his opening brief to non-record evidence (for example, a \nstatement by a government scientist) that every e-mail sent in the United States goes into \na Government database.  Schuchardt Br. 22, 38.  With rare exceptions not in play here, \nwe will not consider evidence outside the record.  See Reed v. Phila. Bethlehem & New \nEngland R.R. Co., 939 F.2d 128, 133 (3rd Cir. 1991). \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 83-2   Filed 04/23/20   Page 8 of 14\ndistrict courts must “demand less in the way of jurisdictional proof than would be \nappropriate at a trial stage.”  Mortensen, 549 F.2d at 892.  Although we have not defined \nthe contours of the “less in the way of jurisdictional proof” standard, we have held that \n“[b]ecause at issue in a factual 12(b)(1) motion is the trial court’s jurisdiction[,] its very \npower to hear the case[,] there is substantial authority that the trial court is free to weigh \nthe evidence and satisfy itself as to the existence of its power to hear the case.”  Id. at \n891.  “The form of the inquiry is flexible . . . : ‘As there is no statutory direction for \nprocedure upon an issue of jurisdiction, the mode of its determination is left to the trial \ncourt.’”  Id. at 891 n.16 (quoting Gibbs v. Buck, 307 U.S. 66, 71–72 (1939)).   \nThis is not a case where Schuchardt presented competent evidence that the District \nCourt discounted or where it weighed competing evidence presented by the Government \nand Schuchardt.4  The Court considered the evidence the Government submitted to \nchallenge Schuchardt’s standing, stated that the burden of proof was on Schuchardt, gave \nhim an opportunity to be heard, and considered his submissions in detail.  On this record, \nthe Court held that he did not create a dispute of material fact as to his standing.  See \nCNA, 535 F.3d at 144–46 (affirming dismissal where plaintiffs were heard on the \njurisdictional issue but failed to present evidence creating a factual dispute as to subject \nmatter jurisdiction).  It did not err by considering the admissibility of Schuchardt’s \nsubmission, as required expressly by some Circuits.  See McPhail v. Deere & Co., 529 \n \n4 This is also not a case where the Government refused to turn over discovery \nrelated to its intelligence-gathering activities.  Schuchardt made no discovery requests, \nand the Court did not rule on any applicable national security privileges.   \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 83-2   Filed 04/23/20   Page 9 of 14\nF.3d 947, 954 (10th Cir. 2008); Meridian Sec. Ins. Co. v. Sadowski, 441 F.3d 536, 540, \n542 (7th Cir. 2006).   \nD.  The District Court’s Evidentiary Rulings \nThus we turn to the evidentiary rulings of the District Court.  It held that the \ndocuments Schuchardt submitted on remand were unauthenticated and contained hearsay, \nand that Binney and Wiebe’s opinions did not meet the reliability requirements for \nadmission of expert testimony.  Gov’t’s Add. A 8–9, 25–26; Gov’t’s Add. B 6–7.5  The \nCourt considered Schuchardt’s lack of evidence in light of the Government’s admissible \nsubmission and concluded that Schuchardt failed to meet his burden of proof. \n  1.  Schuchardt Presented Unauthenticated Documents.  \nA party seeking to rely on a piece of evidence must offer proof sufficient to \nsupport a finding that the item is what that party claims it to be.  Fed. R. Evid. 901(a); \nUnited States v. Browne, 834 F.3d 403, 408 (3d Cir. 2016).  That evidence “must itself be \nadmissible.”  In re Japanese Elec. Prods. Antitrust Litig., 723 F.2d 238, 285 (3d Cir. \n1983).  As for the purported NSA slides, Pl.’s App. 108–13, Schuchardt did not explain \nwhat they were, other than describing them as the “Snowden documents,” Gov’t’s Add. \nA 8–9, 25–26.  The District Court could only speculate about what they were.  The origin \nand nature of the new documents attached to Binney’s affidavit on remand were equally \ndubious.  The new documents included maps showing “tap points” where the NSA \n \n5 The Government inaccurately argues that Schuchardt’s opening brief failed to \naddress the evidentiary holdings.  Gov’t Br. 23.  Schuchardt did argue, if summarily, that \nthe Court understated Binney’s expertise and that he could have authenticated the \ndocuments.  Schuchardt Br. 30–33.   \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 83-2   Filed 04/23/20   Page 10 of 14\nconnects into service providers’ networks and slides explaining collection.  Pl.’s App. \n244–47.  Schuchardt argues that Binney and Wiebe authenticated the documents in their \naffidavits, Schuchardt Reply 6, because those documents related to programs they created \nand worked on, Pl.’s App. 231, and because Binney obtained them from publications, \nwhich in turn allegedly got the documents from Snowden, id. at 232.  The Court correctly \nrejected this argument because Binney claimed no personal knowledge that the \ndocuments he obtained from the publications were those allegedly misappropriated by \nSnowden.  Gov’t’s Add. B 6–7.  Neither Binney nor Wiebe claimed he created the \ndocuments or to know who did.   \nSchuchardt’s argument that the Snowden documents were authenticated by the \nGovernment’s admissions that Snowden misappropriated documents also fails.  Any \ngeneral admissions by Government officials that Snowden stole documents did not \nauthenticate the specific documents Schuchardt submitted to the Court.  See ACLU v. \nU.S. Dep’t of State, 878 F. Supp. 2d 215, 224 (D.D.C. 2012).  Hence there was no abuse \nof discretion in ruling that those documents were not properly authenticated.   \n  2.  Schuchardt Presented Evidence Based on Hearsay.   \nHearsay is any statement, other than one made by a declarant while testifying at \nthe trial or hearing, “offer[ed] in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.”  Fed. \nR. Evid. 801.  It is generally inadmissible as evidence.  See United States v. Pelullo, 964 \nF.2d 193, 203 (3d Cir. 1992).  The District Court concluded that the NSA slides \n“constitute written out-of-court statements regarding PRISM’s operation that \n[Schuchardt] offers for the truth of the matters asserted,” and are inadmissible hearsay.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 83-2   Filed 04/23/20   Page 11 of 14\nGov’t’s Add. A 26.  It reached the same conclusion regarding the new documents \nattached to Binney’s affidavit because Binney claimed no personal knowledge of the \ndocuments and obtained them from journalists, who allegedly obtained them from \nSnowden, so that “[e]ach link in this chain of custody is . . . predicated on . . . hearsay.”  \nGov’t’s Add. B 6–7.  As for the newspaper articles and editorials, the Court held that they \ntoo were hearsay.  Schuchardt offered no substantial argument why these materials were \nsubject to a hearsay exception.  We accordingly affirm the District Court in barring them. \n  3.  Schuchardt Failed to Qualify His Expert Witnesses.  \nFederal Rule of Evidence 702 governs the use of expert testimony in federal courts \nand imposes three threshold considerations: qualifications, reliability, and fit.  See In re \nPaoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 35 F.3d 717, 741–43 (3d Cir. 1994).  An expert witness must \nhave specialized expertise or knowledge.  See id. at 741.  Though we construe the \nspecialized knowledge requirement liberally, “at a minimum, a proffered expert witness \n. . .  must possess skill or knowledge greater than the average layman . . . .”  Waldorf v. \nShuta, 142 F.3d 601, 625 (3d Cir. 1998).  District courts perform a screening function, \ntypically called a Daubert hearing, to ensure that evidence presented is, among other \nthings, reliable.  See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 597 (1993).  It \nis so if “based on the ‘methods and procedures of science’ rather than on ‘subjective \nbelief or unsupported speculation . . . .’”  Paoli, 35 F.3d at 742 (citation omitted).  Rule \n703 permits experts to rely on hearsay so long as it is of the kind normally employed by \nexperts in the field.  See In re TMI Litig., 193 F.3d 613, 697 (3d Cir. 1999).  However, \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 83-2   Filed 04/23/20   Page 12 of 14\nthe trial judge must conduct an independent evaluation of the reasonableness of relying \non the type of data underlying the opinion.  See Paoli, 35 F.3d at 748.   \nBinney stated in his affidavit that he “was the primary designer and developer of a \nnumber of programs designed to acquire and analyze very large amounts” of information \nfrom the “Internet” before leaving the NSA in 2001.  Pl.’s App. 228–29.  He continues to \nserve as a consultant to foreign governments on intelligence collection and has testified \nbefore foreign government agencies.  Id. at 240.  According to Binney, after the \nSeptember 11 attacks the NSA’s surveillance program changed to allow indiscriminate \nbulk data collection, and the President’s Surveillance Program thereafter involved the \n“collection of the full content of domestic e-mail traffic.”  Id. at 230.  Binney based his \nconclusions on “the highly-detailed information contained in the documents leaked by \n[Snowden].”  Id. at 231.  Binney stated that “[t]he documents provided by Mr. Snowden \nare the type of data that experts in the intelligence community would typically and \nreasonably rely upon . . . .”  Id. at 232.  Wiebe submitted a two-page affidavit agreeing \nwith Binney’s assessment based on his review of the same documents.  Id. at 249–54.   \nThe District Court concluded that Binney and Wiebe were not qualified to testify \nas experts.  Neither identified or described the field of “scientific, technical, or other \nspecialized knowledge” in which he is purportedly an expert.  Gov’t Add. B 9.  Wiebe \ndid not discuss the exhibits at all in his affidavit, and Binney did not explain how the \nexhibits led him to reach his conclusions.  Id. at 9–10.  The Court therefore could not \ndetermine whether their conclusions were based on reliable principles and methods.  It \nalso discounted Schuchardt’s argument that the affidavits were admissible under Rule \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 83-2   Filed 04/23/20   Page 13 of 14\n703 based on Binney’s assertion that the Snowden documents are the “type of data that \nexperts in the intelligence community would typically and reasonably rely upon.”  Id. at \n10 n.7.6  That assertion provided no basis for the Court to conduct an independent \nevaluation into reasonableness.  Id.  Moreover, Schuchardt did not request a Daubert \nhearing or submit evidence regarding Binney and Wiebe’s field of expertise or their \nmethodologies.  Accordingly, the Court did not abuse its discretion in barring their \ntestimony as experts.   \n  4.  The Government’s Evidence  \nContrast Schuchardt’s lack of competent evidence against the admissible \nsubmissions by the Government.  These included a sworn declaration from Wayne \nMurphy, the Director of Operations at the NSA, who was “responsible for . . . managing \nthe integration and use of the NSA’s global foreign intelligence authorities” and had \n“personal knowledge” of the matters alleged in Schuchardt’s complaint.  Pl.’s App. 173.  \nHe stated that “[n]either PRISM nor any other NSA intelligence-gathering activity \ninvolves the bulk collection (or storage) of all or substantially all of the e-mail (or other \nInternet-based communications) of all U.S. persons.”  Id.  The District Court credited \nthose statements and reasoned that Schuchardt could not show that his communications \nwould have been targeted and collected.  Gov’t Add. A 22.  The Government also cited \nother authorities, such as the Report on the Surveillance Program Operated Pursuant to \nSection 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act issued in July 2014 by the \n \n6 The District Court also separately ruled, and we affirm, that Binney and Wiebe \ncould not testify as fact witnesses because they did not claim any personal knowledge of \nthe NSA’s current collection programs.  Gov’t’s Add. A 29–31.   \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 83-2   Filed 04/23/20   Page 14 of 14\nPrivacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, as well as case law from other Circuits, \nacknowledging the targeted nature of PRISM, see, e.g., United States v. Mohamud, 843 \nF.3d 420, 440 (9th Cir. 2016).   \n*     *     *     *     * \nBecause the District Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that \nSchuchardt’s evidence was inadmissible and that the Government’s evidence stood \nuncontroverted, we affirm its ruling that Schuchardt lacked factual standing for his suit. \n \n14 \n ",

OBAMA, as President of   \nthe United States, et al.,   \n   \n      Defendants. \n \n \nMOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n  The Plaintiff, Elliott Schuchardt, files this motion for a preliminary injunction.  In \nsupport hereof, the Plaintiff states as follows: \nRelief Requested \n1.  The Plaintiff respectfully moves for a preliminary injunction for the reasons set \nforth in the Plaintiff's accompanying memorandum of law.  A copy of such brief is \nincorporated by reference herein.   \n2.  As explained in such brief, at least one other federal court has granted a \npreliminary injunction in a case challenging the government’s bulk collection of telephony \nmetadata.  See Klayman v. Obama, 957 F. Supp. 2d 1, 27, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176925, \n67-68, 2013 WL 6571596 (D.D.C. 2013). \n3.  The facts of this case are far more egregious.  In this case, the Plaintiff \ncontends that the Defendants are collecting not just \"call detail\" records, but the actual \nintimate content contained in the nation’s e-mail.  \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 25   Filed 01/07/15   Page 2 of 4\n4.  The Defendants are -- by definition -- incapable of policing their own use of \nsuch vast information. This is because one branch of government cannot effectively review, \nor check, its own conduct.  The key to the data must be held by a third party, such as the \ncourts.  \n5.  If the executive branch continues to hold the key to this massive database of \nprivate information, the consequences are foreseeable and disastrous:  Political leaders \nwill want to search the database for information about their political opponents.  Employees \nof the NSA will access the records of major law firms and investment banks for inside \ninformation concerning investments.  Government employees will use the database to \n\"cyberstalk\" the objects of their affection.  The trade secrets of the Fortune 500 are at risk.   \n6.  The dangers posed by the Defendants' conduct are real.  This is why political \nwiretapping was taken so seriously a generation ago, during the Watergate scandal.  This \nis why some of our highest-ranking public employees have sacrificed their careers, and \nrisked their liberty, to bring this matter to the attention of the Court.  \n  WHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth above, the Plaintiff respectfully requests \nthat the Court approve the accompanying order (a) barring the Defendants from collecting \nthe Plaintiff’s e-mail, web queries, and phone metadata, (b) directing the Defendants to \ndestroy any such information about the Plaintiff in their possession, and (c) prohibiting the \nDefendants from querying data currently in their possession using e-mail addresses or \nphone numbers associated with the Plaintiff.  \n  2 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 25   Filed 01/07/15   Page 3 of 4\n              Respectfully submitted, \n              By: /s/ Elliott J.

As such, he \nhas  ultimate  authority  over  the  actions  of  the  United  States  federal  government.  \nPresident Obama maintains an address at The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, \nWashington, DC 20500. \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 2 of 30\n3.  Defendant James R. Clapper is the Director of National Intelligence (“DNI”).  \nAs such, Clapper has ultimate authority over the activities of the intelligence community.  \nDefendant  Clapper  maintains  an  address  at  James  R.  Clapper,  Director  of  National \nIntelligence, Washington, DC 20511.  \n4.  Defendant  Admiral  Michael  R.  Rogers  is  the  Director  of  the  National \nSecurity Agency (“NSA”).  As such, Rogers has ultimate authority for supervising and \nimplementing  all  operations  and  functions  of  the  NSA,  the  agency  responsible  for \nconducting surveillance authorized by the challenged law.  Admiral Rogers maintains an \naddress at National Security Agency, 9800 Savage Road, Fort Meade, MD 20755.   \n5.  Defendant James B. Comey is the Director of the FBI.  As such, Comey is \nresponsible for applications made to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court under \nSection  215  of  the  Patriot  Act.    Defendant  Comey  maintains  an  address  at  FBI \nHeadquarters, 935 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20535-0001.   \nBackground \n1.  This lawsuit seeks an injunction against the Defendants’ bulk collection of \ndomestic e-mail and phone records, in violation of the 4th Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution.   \n2.  The facts of this case are fairly well established.   \n3.  In  approximately  1996,  the  general  public  started  using  e-mail  on  a \nwidespread basis.   \n4.  Shortly thereafter, the federal government’s electronic surveillance agency \n-- the National Security Agency (“NSA”) -- began intercepting and storing international \ne-mail.   \n  2 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 3 of 30\n5.  Domestic e-mail, however, was off limits to the agency without a court order.  \nThis  is  because  of  the  requirements of the  Fourth  Amendment of  the  United  States \nconstitution.       \n6.  On  October  4,  2001,  former  President  George  W.  Bush  authorized  a \nsurveillance program that involved the government’s collection of domestic e-mail without \na warrant. \n7.  Since that date, a steady stream of high-ranking government officials has \ncome forward to warn the American people of the implications – and dangers -- of the \ngovernment’s conduct.  \nBinney allegations \n8.  One of the first critics was William E. Binney, a senior employee of the NSA.  \nOver the course of his career – 31 years -- Binney came to be regarded as something as \na  legend  at  the  NSA,  having  mentored  the  technical  work  of  approximately  6,000 \nemployees.   \n9.  While at the NSA, Binney set up a computer program designed to “data-\nmine” foreign e-mail communications quickly and efficiently.   \n10.  After September 11, 2001, Binney learned that the NSA was using a similar \ntype of program to collect and analyze domestic e-mail, without a warrant.   \n11.  Binney tried to warn persons in the United States government that this was \noccurring, and that it could be extremely dangerous.   \n12.  In late 2001, he resigned from the NSA, because he refused to cooperate in \nthe agency’s actions.   \n  3 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 4 of 30\nJewel v. NSA \n13.  In May 2006, Mark Klein, an AT&T technician with 22 years of experience, \nrevealed that the NSA was copying e-mail communications on AT&T’s network by means \nof a secret facility set up in San Francisco.   \n14.  On September 18, 2008, Carolyn Jewel and five other persons filed a class \naction lawsuit against the NSA in the United States District Court for the Northern District \nof California.  The case is currently pending in such court under case number 08-cv-\n04373-JSW (the “Jewel case”).   \n15.  The complaint contends that the NSA has set up a network of surveillance \ndevices that allow the NSA to acquire “the content of a significant portion of the phone \ncalls, e-mail, instant messages, text messages, web communications – both international \nand domestic – of virtually every American who uses the phone system or internet.”1 \n16.  The  complaint  further  contends  that  the  defendants  in  the  case  are \nanalyzing this data by means of computers, in what is described as a “vast data-mining \noperation.”2   \n17.  The  complaint  seeks  an  order  enjoining  the  Jewel  defendants  from \ncontinuing to access the Plaintiffs’ e-mail and other communications without a court order.  \n18.  Significantly, several former employees of the NSA have filed Affidavits in \nthe case in support of an injunction.  \n19.   On July 2, 2012, William Binney filed an Affidavit.  Paragraph 5 of the \nAffidavit states the following: \n                                                 \n1 Jewel Complaint, ¶ 9, Jewel v. NSA, Docket No. 1. \n \n2 Jewel Complaint, ¶ 11, Jewel v. NSA, Docket No. 1. \n \n  4 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 5 of 30\n[In  late  2001,]  the  NSA  began  to  implement  the  .  .  .  President’s \nSurveillance Program (“PSP”).  [M]embers of my . . . team were given \nthe task of implementing various aspects of the PSP.  They confided \nin me and told me that the PSP involved the collection of domestic \nelectronic  communications  traffic  without  any  of  the  privacy \nprotections built into [the former program].    \nI resigned from the NSA in late 2001.  I could not stay after the NSA \nbegan purposefully violating the Constitution.3 \n20.  Thomas Drake, a former employee of the NSA with 29 years of experience \nin the field, also filed an affidavit.  Drake’s affidavit states as follows: \nVarious employees who were implementing . . . aspects of the PSP \nconfided in me and told me that the PSP involved the collection of \ndomestic  electronic  communications  traffic  without  any  privacy \nprotections or judicial oversight.   \n*   *   * \n[The NSA] has, or is in the process of obtaining, the capability to \nseize and store most electronic communications passing through its \nU.S. intercept centers.  The wholesale collection of data allows the \nNSA to identify and analyze Entities or Communities of Interest later \nin a static database. \n*   *   * \nGiven a central database, the question becomes how the NSA and \nother federal agencies (FBI, CIA, Homeland Security, etc.) use it.  \nThe data is searchable and available.  There is no effective technical \noversight by Congress or the courts.  It is seductively enticing to \nignore the law.4   \n21.  Kirk Wiebe, a third former employee of the NSA, also filed a statement in \nthe case.  Paragraph 9 of Wiebe’s affidavit states as follows: \nI agree with the analysis and conclusions set forth in Mr. Binney’s \ndeclaration, particularly about the capabilities of the NARUS device.  \n                                                 \n3 Binney Affidavit, ¶ 5, Jewel v. NSA, Docket No. 88 (emphasis added).  \n4 Drake Affidavit, ¶¶ 7-9 Jewel v. NSA, Docket No. 87 (emphasis added).   \n  5 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 6 of 30\nLike Mr. Binney, I have concluded that . . . the NSA has chosen to \nseize and save all electronic communications.5 \n22.  On August 31, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit \nissued an opinion finding that the Jewel plaintiffs had standing to sue the NSA for an \ninjunction.  Jewel v. NSA, 673 F.3d 902 (9th Cir. 2011).   \n23.  The case is currently pending before the U.S. District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of California.    \nSnowden allegations \n24.  In June 2013, a new person came forward to warn of the danger of the \nDefendants’ conduct.  That citizen was Edward Snowden.   \n25.  Snowden  is  a  former  system  administrator  for  the  Central  Intelligence \nAgency  (“CIA”)  and  a  counterintelligence  trainer  at  the  Defense  Intelligence  Agency \n(“DIA”).  Snowden later worked for the consulting firm, Booz Allen Hamilton, inside an \nNSA center located in Hawaii.   \n26.  In  these  positions,  Snowden  worked  directly  with  the  Chief  Information \nOfficer at the CIA to solve the agency's technology problems.  He was therefore in a very \nsenior position in the government.   \n27.  While working for the Defendants, Snowden learned that the Defendants \nwere intercepting, monitoring and storing the content of all or substantially all of the e-mail \nsent by American citizens by means of several large internet service providers.  Snowden \nalso learned that the Defendants were collecting information about all phone calls made \nin the United States.   \n                                                 \n5 Wiebe Affidavit, ¶ 9, Jewel v. NSA, Docket No. 86 (emphasis added).   \n  6 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 7 of 30\n28.  Virtually  all  of  this  collection  activity  was  being  done  without  a  judicial \nwarrant.  \n29.  On  March  13,  2013,  Defendant  James  Clapper,  the  then-Director  of \nNational Intelligence, told a committee of the United States Senate that the NSA does \n\"not wittingly\" collect information on millions of Americans.   \n30.  Clapper's  statement  was  a  knowing  falsehood,  designed  to  mislead  the \nUnited States Congress.6 \n31.  Snowden learned of Clapper's statement on the following day.  He then \ndecided to expose the Defendants' bulk collection of private communications.   \n32.  Like William Binney, Snowden had previously tried to obtain reform from \ninside the United States government.  However, he had been unable to do so.  He \ntherefore leaked documents revealing the Defendants' collection program to the Guardian \nand Washington Post newspapers. \n33.  On June 5, 2013, the Guardian published an article based on Snowden's \ndocuments.  The article reported that the Defendants had obtained a secret court order \nfrom the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (the “FISC”) directing Verizon Business \nNetwork Services, Inc. (“Verizon”) to provide to the Defendants all “call detail records” for \ncalls made wholly within the United States.7   \n                                                 \n6 Clapper's statement was also made under oath, a federal crime punishable by up to \neight years in prison.  18 U.S.C. § 1001 (2014).   \n \n7 See Ex. A to First Amended Complaint, Glenn Greenwald, “NSA Collecting Phone \nRecords of Millions of Verizon Customers Daily,” Guardian, June 5, 2013.  A copy of the \nVerizon order is attached as Exhibit B to the First Amended Complaint.  This complaint \nincorporates by reference all documents referred to herein that have been filed elsewhere \nin this case or in the Jewel case.  \n \n \n  7 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 8 of 30\n34.  Shortly  thereafter,  the  Defendants  admitted  that  the  FISC  order  was \ngenuine, and declassified the program.8  There is therefore no issue of fact concerning \nwhether the Defendants are collecting call detail records.   \n35.  The following day, on June 6, 2013, the Guardian published a second article \nbased on Snowden’s documents.9  The article reported that the Defendants had obtained \ndirect access to the servers of several large internet companies, including Yahoo, Google, \nFacebook, Twitter, Dropbox, and Apple.  This program is known as \"Prism.\"     \n36.  The documents show that the Defendants are intercepting, accessing and \nstoring (hereafter, “collecting”) massive quantities of e-mail and other data created by \nUnited States citizens.   \n37.  The information collected includes the full content of e-mail, videos, photos, \nstored data, voice over IP, file transfers, as well as a variety of other information.10   \n38.  Such information is obtained \"directly from the servers of these U.S. service \nproviders:  Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube and \nApple.\"11 \n39.  According to the documents, the Defendants began collecting information \nfrom Microsoft on September 11, 2007; from Yahoo on March 12, 2008; from Google on \nJanuary 14, 2009; from Facebook on June 3, 2009; from YouTube on September 24, \n                                                 \n8 On December 16, 2013, Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court for \nthe District of Columbia found the Defendants' program unconstitutional, and issued a \npreliminary injunction against the program.  See Klayman v. Obama, Case No. 1:13-cv-\n00851-RJL (D.C. Cir. 2013).  \n \n9 See Exhibit C to First Amended Complaint, Glenn Greenwald, \"NSA Prism Taps into \nUser Data of Apple, Google and Others,\" Guardian, July 6, 2013.   \n \n10 See Exhibit D to First Amended Complaint.   \n \n11 Id.  \n \n  8 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 9 of 30\n2010; from Skype on February 6, 2011; from AOL on March 31, 2001; and from Apple in \nOctober 2012 (only days after the death of its founder, Steve Jobs).12 \n40.  The above dates (and referenced document) are extremely important.  They \nshow that the Defendants are collecting all of the content in the various stated-categories.  \nIf the Defendants were not collecting all content, then the above beginning dates for \ncollection  of  \"stored  communications\"  would  not  be  relevant  or  important  to  the \nDefendants.   \n41.  Other documents, provided by Snowden, confirm this understanding.  For \nexample, one of the slides provided by Snowden is labeled “New Collection Posture.”  It \nsays:  “Sniff It All, Know It All, Collect It All, Process It All.”13  Another document boasts \nthat the Defendants are \"one step closer to collecting it all.\"14   \n42.  For example, the Defendants are literally storing every single document \nstored on Microsoft's Skydrive -- a cloud service.  One document states as follows: \nBeginning on 7 March 2013, PRISM now collects Microsoft Skydrive \ndata as part of PRISM's standard Stored Communications collection \npackage. . . .   This means that analysts will no longer have to make \na special request to SSO for this -- a process step that many analysts \nmay not have known about.  This success is the result of the FBI \nworking  for  many  months  with  Microsoft  to  get  this  tasking  and \ncollection  solution  established.    \"Skydrive  is  a  cloud  service  that \nallows users to store and access their files on a variety of devices.\"15   \n                                                 \n12 See Exhibit E to First Amended Complaint.   \n \n13 See Exhibit F to First Amended Complaint.  \n \n14 See Exhibit G to First Amended Complaint.  \n \n15 See Exhibit H to First Amended Complaint.  \n  9 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 10 of 30\n43.  According to journalist Bob Woodward, the NSA has developed the ability \n“to capture all the data, store it, [and] make it instantly available to intelligence analysts \nand operators.”16   \n44.  The  Defendants'  collection  efforts  have  become  so  massive  that  the \nDefendants are having difficulty processing all of the data.  According to one document \nobtained  from  Snowden:    \"Collection  is  outpacing  [the  Defendants']  ability  to  ingest, \nprocess and store to the 'norms' to which [they] have become accustomed.\"17 \n45.  Any doubt about the meaning of these documents is resolved by the public \nstatements made by Edward Snowden, himself.  During a video interview published by \nthe Guardian, on June 10, 2013, Snowden stated: \nI,  sitting  at  my  desk,  could  wiretap  anyone,  from  you  or  your \naccountant,  to  a  federal  judge  or  even  the  president,  if  I  had  a \npersonal e-mail.18 \n46.  One month later, on July 12, 2013, Snowden released a statement during a \npress conference.  The first paragraph of the statement read as follows: \nHello.  My name is Edward Snowden.  A little over a month ago, I had \na family, a home in paradise, and I lived in great comfort.  I also had \nthe capability, without a warrant, to search for, seize, and read your \ncommunications.  Anyone's communications at any time.  That is the \npower to change people's fates.  It's also a serious violation of the \nlaw, the 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution of my country.19   \n                                                 \n16 Bob Woodward, Obama’s Wars, at 7. \n \n17 See Exhibit I to First Amended Complaint.  \n \n18 See Exhibit J to First Amended Complaint, Glenn Greenwald, \"X-Keyscore:  NSA Tool \nCollects Nearly Everything A User Does on the Internet,\" Guardian, July 31, 2013.   \n \n19 See Exhibit K to First Amended Complaint, \"Edward Snowden Statement:  It was the \nRight Thing to \\Do and I Have No Regrets,\" Guardian, July 13, 2013.   \n \n  10 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 11 of 30\n47.  Following Snowden’s disclosures, the Defendants claimed that they were \nonly  storing  “metadata,”  and  not  the  actual  words  of  the  citizenry’s  electronic \ncommunications.    Snowden  responded  to  this  allegation  in  March  2014,  when  he \nappeared  at  a  TED  conference  in  Vancouver,  Canada.    During  that  appearance, \nSnowden said the following: \nThe best way to understand PRISM . . . is to first talk about what \nPRISM  isn't.  Much  of  the  debate  in  the  U.S.  has  been  about \nmetadata. They've said it's just metadata, it's just metadata . . . . \nPRISM is about content.20 \n48.  More recently, extended interviews with Snowden have appeared in Laura \nPoitras’ film, CitizenFour.  In the film, Snowden directly states that the Defendants are \ncollecting the full content of Americans’ e-mail, without a warrant.   \n49.  Snowden  has  therefore  confirmed  the  allegations  of  Binney,  Drake  and \nWiebe in the Jewel case.   \nLevinson allegations \n50.  Following  Snowden's  disclosures,  the  Defendants  contacted  Snowden's \ne-mail service, Lavabit, and made an extraordinary demand.   \n51.  The Defendants demanded that Lavabit install a device on its server which \nwould  have  provided  the  Defendants  with  access  to  the  full  content  of  all  e-mail \nmessages for all of Lavabit's 410,000 customers.21   \n                                                 \n20 Transcript of Snowden appearance, www.ted.com.   \n21 See Exhibit L to First Amended Complaint, Statement of Ladar Levinson, Owner of \nLavabit.   \n \n  11 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 12 of 30\n52.  The Defendants also demanded that the company's owner, Ladar Levinson, \nprovide  to  the  government  the  private  encryption  keys  for  all  of  Lavabit's  e-mail \naccounts.22    \n53.  On August 8, 2013, Levinson voluntarily shut down Lavabit, because he \ncould no longer provide a secure e-mail service to his customers.23  \n54.  The following day, on August 9, 2013, another encrypted e-mail service -- \nSilent Circle -- voluntarily shut down operations.  After doing so, Silent Circle destroyed its \ne-mail  server  so  that  its  database  of  e-mail  communications  would  not  fall  into  the \nDefendants' hands.   \n55.  Since August 9, 2013, there has been no secure e-mail service within the \nUnited States.  The content of all e-mail sent or passing through the United States is \nmonitored and/or stored by the Defendants without a warrant.     \nDefendants’ Purported Authority \n56.  On  January  17,  2014,  the  White  House  issued  a  “Presidential  Policy \nDirective” admitting that the Defendants are collecting “signals intelligence” “in bulk.”     \n57.  The Directive made repeated reference to an obscure presidential order, \nExecutive Order 12333, as partial grounds for the bulk collection of private data.   \n58.  Executive  Order  12333  authorizes  bulk  collection  of  data  about  United \nStates citizens for a variety of very broad reasons.  The order was originally issued in \nDecember 1981.  The order was amended in 2004 and 2008, substantially expanding the \n                                                 \n22 See Exhibit L to First Amended Complaint.  When Levinson challenged the Defendants' \ndemands, the Defendants' argued that they were not bound by the Fourth Amendment \nbecause Lavabit's e-mail database would be inspected by \"means of a machine.\"  Id.  \nThis confirms that the Defendants are data-mining the nation's e-mail database.   \n \n23  Id.   \n \n  12 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 13 of 30\nalleged powers granted by the order.  The order has been subject to little or no judicial \nreview.   \n59.  On July 18, 2014, the Washington Post published an article written by John \nNapier Tye, a former employee of the United States State Department.   \n60.  In  such  position,  Tye  attended  two  classified  National  Security  Agency \nbriefings on Executive Order 12333, in Fall 2013 and February 2014, so that he could \nhelp prepare the State Department's response to the leaks disclosed by Snowden.24 \n61.  In  the  article,  Tye  stated  that  the  Defendants  were  claiming  the  legal \nauthority  to  collect  the  nation's  entire  e-mail  database  under  Executive  Order,  No. \n12333.25  According to Tye: \nOnce it [your data] transits outside of the US, or is stored on a server \noutside of the United States . . . it can be collected under 12333. \nThere’s nothing in the executive order that would prevent all of your \ncommunications from being collected. . . . When the NSA collects \ndata in a foreign country, it is possible and even likely that they will \ncollect  American’s  data  and  communicationsS  In  theory  almost \nevery  electronic  communication  that  every  American  sends  to \nanother American within the United States can be collected by the \nNSA under this authority, outside of our borders, because of how the \nInternet is designed. . . .  \nIt’s a very intrusive power.  Even Congress and the courts don’t know \nanything about 12333.  None of the mechanisms that we have in \nplace is performing an oversight role.26 \n                                                 \n24 Cyrus Farivar, “Meet John Tye: the kinder, gentler, and by-the-book whistleblower,” Ars \nTechnica, Aug. 20, 2014.  \n \n25 John Napier Tye, “Meet Executive Order 12333:  The Reagan Rule That Allows the \nNSA to Spy on Americans,” Washington Post, July 18, 2014.   \n \n26  John  Haltiwanger,  “The  U.S.  Government  Made  It  Legal  to  Look  at  All  of  Your \nMessages and This Whistleblower Has Proof,” Elite Daily, Aug. 19, 2014.  Tye, a Rhodes \nScholar with a law decree from Yale University, maintains that the Defendants’ bulk \ncollection of domestic e-mail is a violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States \n  13 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 14 of 30\n62.  According to a document that was recently declassified, Executive Order \n12333 is the “primary source of NSA's foreign intelligence-gathering authority.”27 \n63.  Thus, it appears that the Defendants are doing the bulk of their collection \nunder the purported authority of Executive Order 12333 – a federal rule that was never \nreviewed or enacted by Congress.   \n64.  The Defendants, however, are not able to obtain everything under Executive \nOrder 12333.  To obtain certain information, such as encrypted e-mails, the Defendants \nneed additional information -- from the persons providing such encryption.28 \n65.  To obtain this latter information, the Defendants appear to be using Section \n215 of the Patriot Act.  50 U.S.C. § 1861 (2014).   \n66.  Section 215 authorizes the Defendants to request a subpoena, called a \n“National Security Letter,” from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (the “FISC”).  \nThe entire proceeding is secret and done on an ex parte basis, without the knowledge of \nthe proposed recipient of the letter.  Id. \n67.  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (“FISC”) is authorized to issue \nsuch  a  letter  upon  a  finding  that  there  are  “reasonable  grounds”  to  believe  that  the \nrequested  records  are  “relevant  to  an  authorized  investigation.”    50  U.S.C. \n§ 1861(b)(2)(A) (2014).   \n                                                                                                                                                                \nConstitution.

This is because even the fastest supercomputers cannot obtain \nencryption codes that exceed a certain number of digits.  This is what created the market \nfor Lavabit and Silent Circle.     \n \n  14 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 15 of 30\n68.  Once a National Security Letter has been issued, the recipient of such letter \nis prohibited from disclosing the existence of the letter to any person other than his or her \nattorney, and persons authorized by the FBI.  50 U.S.C. § 1861(d)(1) (2014).29 \n69.  In addition to the above two sections, the Defendants are purporting to act \npursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\"FISA\"), codified at \n50 U.S.C. § 1881a.   \n70.  On June 8, 2013, Defendant James Clapper, the then-Director of National \nIntelligence, released a statement which admitted and declassified portions of the Prism \nprogram.   \n71.  Clapper's statement implied that the Defendants' collection of information \nwas being done solely under Section 702 of FISA.30 \n72.  Clapper's  statement  was  disingenuous,  in  that  it  implied  that  the \nDefendants' collection of information for the Prism database was far smaller than its \nactual scope, and that the Defendants were acting under a single, limited authority.   \n73.  As stated above, the Defendants’ collection program under Prism is far \nbroader than the limited collection referred in Clapper’s statement.   \n74.  On  June  19,  2014,  the  U.S.  House  of  Representatives  overwhelmingly \napproved  a  bill  that  would  prevent  the  Defendants  from  conducting  searches  of  the \n                                                 \n29 This provision of the law appears to be a patent violation of the First Amendment.  \nLadar Levinson, the owner of Lavabit, challenged this provision.  After many months of \nlitigation, a federal judge authorized him to tell his story publicly.  It is only because of his \nlitigation that we know that the Defendants were seizing all of the e-mail in the Lavabit \nserver, together with the decryption pass codes.  \n \n30 Section 702 allows the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence to \nobtain information relating to foreign intelligence investigations, subject to review by the \nFISC.  The authority is far more limited than the above two authorities, Section 215 of the \nPatriot Act and Executive Order 12333.   \n \n  15 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 16 of 30\nnation's e-mail database without a warrant.  The bill was adopted by a large majority of \nhouse members, 293 to 123.   \n75.  The U.S. Senate has not acted on the bill as of this date.  \nClass Action Allegations \n76.  Pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \nthe Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of himself and a nationwide class (the \"Nationwide \nClass\") of similarly situated persons defined as:  American citizens who are subscribers, \nusers, and/or consumers of the internet services of Google, Yahoo, and Facebook, the \ncloud storage services of Dropbox, and the telecommunication services of Verizon. \n77.  Excluded  from  the  Nationwide  Class  are  the  Defendants,  their  legal \nrepresentatives, heirs, successors, and assigns of Defendants, and all judges who may \never adjudicate this case. \n78.  This action is brought as a class action and may be so maintained pursuant \nto  the  provisions  of  Rule  23  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.    The  Plaintiff \nreserves the right to modify the Nationwide Class. \n79.  Numerosity of the Nationwide Class: The National Class is so numerous \nthat the individual joinder of all members, in this or any action is impracticable. The exact \nnumber or identification of Class members is presently unknown to the Plaintiff, but it is \nbelieved that the Class numbers over a hundred million citizens. The identity of Class \nmembers and their addresses maybe ascertained from the business records for Google, \nYahoo,  Facebook,  Dropbox  and  Verizon.  Class  members  may  be  informed  of  the \npendency of this action by a combination of direct mail and/or public notice. \n  16 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 17 of 30\n80.   Commonality:  There  is  a  well-defined  community  of  interest  in  the \nquestions of law and fact involved affecting the members of the Class. These common \nlegal and factual questions include: \na.  Whether Defendants' surveillance and gathering of American \ncitizens' telephonic, internet, and social media data violated \nthe Plaintiff’s and Class Members' constitutional rights, as \nguaranteed under the First and Fourth Amendments;  \nb.  Whether the Plaintiff’s and Class members are entitled to \ndeclaratory, injunctive and/or equitable relief; and \nc.  Whether  the  Plaintiff  and  Class  Members  are  entitled  to \ndeclaratory, injunctive and/or equitable relief.  \n81.  Typicality: The Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the claims of the members of \nthe Class because the Plaintiff and the Class members are or were each a subscriber, \nconsumer, or user of the internet services of Google, Yahoo, and Facebook, the cloud \nstorage  services  of  Dropbox,  and  the  telecommunication  services  of  Verizon.    The \nPlaintiff  and  all  members  of  the  Class  have  similarly  suffered  harm  arising  from \nDefendants' violations of law, as alleged herein. \n82.  Adequacy: The Plaintiff is an adequate representative of the Class because \nhis interests do not conflict with the interests of the members of the Class they seek to \nrepresent.  The Plaintiff is not seeking any sort of attorneys fees in this case.31  The \nPlaintiff intends to prosecute this action vigorously. The Plaintiff will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interest of the members of the Class. \n83.   This  suit  may  also  be  maintained  as  a  class  action  pursuant  to  Rule \n23(b)(2) of the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) because Plaintiffs and the Class \nseek declaratory and injunctive relief, and all of the above factors of numerosity, common \n                                                 \n31 If the Plaintiff retains counsel in this matter, then he will be seeking attorneys fees to \ncompensate such counsel. \n  17 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 18 of 30\nquestions of fact and law, typicality and adequacy are present. Defendants have acted on \ngrounds generally applicable to the Plaintiff and the Class as a whole, thereby making \ndeclaratory and/or injunctive relief proper. \n84.  Predominance and Superiority: This suit may also be maintained as a class \naction under Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure because questions of \nlaw  and  fact  common  to  the  Class  predominate  over  the  questions  affecting  only \nindividual members of the Class and a class action is superior to other available means \nfor the fair and efficient adjudication of this dispute. The damages suffered by each \nindividual Class member, depending on the circumstances, may be relatively small or \nmodest, especially given the burden and expense of individual prosecution of the complex \nand extensive litigation necessitated by Defendants' conduct. Furthermore, it would be \nvirtually impossible for the Class members, on an individual basis, to obtain effective \nredress for the wrongs done to them. Moreover, even if Class members themselves could \nafford such individual litigation, the court system could not.  Individual litigation presents a \npotential for inconsistent or contradictory judgments.  Individualized litigation increases \nthe delay and expenses to all parties and the court system presented by the complex \nlegal  issues  of  the  case.  By  contrast,  the  class  action  device  presents  far  fewer \nmanagement difficulties and provides the benefits of a single adjudication, economy of \nscale, and comprehensive supervision by a single court. \n  18 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 19 of 30\nCOUNT I \nDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief \nViolation of the Fourth Amendment \nBulk Collection of E-mail \n85.  The  Plaintiff  incorporates  by  reference  the  allegations  set  forth  in  the \npreceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.   \n86.  The Plaintiff, Elliott J. Schuchardt, is an American citizen and constitutional \nlawyer.   \n87.  Schuchardt is a consumer of various types of electronic communication, \nstorage, and internet-search services.  These include the e-mail services provided by \nGoogle and Yahoo; the internet search service provided by Google; the cloud storage \nservices  provided  by  Google  and  Dropbox;  the  e-mail  and  instant message  services \nprovided by Facebook; and the cell phone and text communication service provided by \nVerizon Communications.  \n88.  The Defendants are unlawfully intercepting, accessing, monitoring and/or \nstoring the private communications of the Plaintiff, made or stored through such services.   \n89.  This complaint will refer to the Defendants' above-described activities as the \n“collection” of private communications. \n90.  The Defendants’ collection of data includes both the content of the Plaintiff’s \ne-mail, as well as the “metadata” associated with such e-mail. \n91.  For purposes of this complaint, the content of an e-mail includes the actual \ntext  of  the  e-mail  and  any  attachments  to  the  e-mail,  including  photographs  and \ndocuments.    \n  19 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 20 of 30\n92.  Since  March  12,  2006,  the  Defendants  have  been  collecting  both  the \ncontent and the metadata of the Plaintiffs’ private e-mail communications sent through the \nYahoo e-mail system.   \n93.  Since  January  14,  2009,  the  Defendants  have  been  collecting  both  the \ncontent and the metadata of the Plaintiffs’ private e-mail communications sent through the \nGoogle “gmail” e-mail system.  \n94.  Since January 14, 2009, the Defendants have been collecting the content \nand the metadata of the Plaintiffs’ private internet search history through the Google \nsearch website.  \n95.  Since June 3, 2009, the Defendants have been collecting the content of the \nPlaintiff's e-mail and instant messages through Facebook.       \n96.  Upon  information  and  belief,  since  approximately  June  2013,  the \nDefendants have been collecting the content and metadata of documents stored by the \nPlaintiff using the Dropbox cloud storage service.   \n97.  The documents, images and communications collected by the Defendants \ncontain information of a private and confidential nature.  Such communications include \nbank account numbers; credit card numbers; passwords for financial data; health records; \nand trade secrets of a confidential and valuable nature.     \n98.  The  documents  and  communications  collected  by  the  Defendants  also \ninclude communications with clients of Schuchardt's law firm, which are privileged and \nconfidential under applicable law.   \n99.  Upon information and belief, the Defendants are storing such information in \na  computer  database,  or  through  a  government  program,  which  the  Defendants  call \n“Prism.”   \n  20 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 21 of 30\n100.  Upon information and belief, the Defendants are collecting such information \nin order to \"data mine\" the nation's e-mail database.  Data mining in the process of \ncollecting, searching and analyzing large  amounts of data for the purpose of finding \npatterns or relationships in such data.     \n101.  The Defendants’ conduct is unlawful under the United States Constitution, \nthe civil and criminal laws of the federal government, and the civil and criminal laws of the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania.   \n102.  It is impossible to understate the danger of the Defendants' conduct.  The \nframers  of  the  United  States  constitution  were  familiar  with  abusive  governmental \nconduct.  They therefore specifically stated that the United States government would not \nhave the power to search and seize the private papers of United States citizens without \nobtaining a warrant from a neutral and detached magistrate, issued upon a finding of \nprobable cause.   \n103.  Now, for the first time in history, a small group of persons within the United \nStates government is attempting to seize all of the private, electronic communications of \nthe American citizenry, with little or no independent review. \n104.  The  system  set  up  by  the  Defendants  –  where  the  government  has \npossession of all private communications and stored electronic documents – is unstable.  \nThe system is ripe for abuse and could lead to the destruction of the republic.     \n105.  According to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, this Court has the power to adjudicate a \ndispute between the Plaintiff and the Defendants involving any issue involving federal law. \n106.  The  Plaintiff  is  aggrieved  by  the  above-described  conduct  of  the \nDefendants.  \n  21 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 22 of 30\n107.  The Defendants are subject to the law established by the United States \nConstitution.   \n108.  According to the 4th Amendment of the United States Constitution:  \nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, \nand effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not \nbe violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, \nsupported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place \nto be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. \n109.  The Plaintiff has an expectation of privacy in the above-described private \ninformation and electronic communications being collected by the Defendants.   \n110.  The Defendants have unlawfully collected such information in violation of \nthe 4th Amendment, without obtaining a warrant and without probable cause.   \n111.  As  of  this  date,  the  Defendants  have  refused  to  provide  any  public \nexplanation of the legal authority that purports to authorize their intrusion into the affairs of \nthe Plaintiff.  \n112.  The Plaintiff respectfully submits that any such purported authority, when \nultimately disclosed by the Defendants, is unlawful as a violation of the 4th Amendment of \nthe United States Constitution.  \n113.  If the Defendants are purporting to act pursuant to secret orders established \nby the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the Plaintiff respectfully submits that any \nsuch  authority  is  also  unlawful  as  a  violation  of  the  due  process  clause  of  the  14th \nAmendment.   \n  WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter \nan order (a) enjoining the Defendants from engaging in any further collection of the \nabove-described  information  about  the  Plaintiff  and  the  Nationwide  Class,  and  (b) \n  22 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 23 of 30\nestablishing procedures to ensure that the Defendants refrain from unlawful conduct in \nthe future.   \nCOUNT II \nDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief \nViolation of the Fourth Amendment \nBulk Collection of Verizon Metadata \n114.  The  Plaintiff  incorporates  by  reference  the  allegations  set  forth  in  the \npreceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.   \n115.  Since  approximately  2008,  the  Defendants  have  been  collecting  the \nmetadata  associated  with  the  Plaintiff's  cell  phone  communications  through  Verizon \nCommunications.   \n116.  Such  metadata  includes  information  about  the  persons  that  Schuchardt \ncalls, the duration of such calls, and the frequency of such calls.   \n117.  By  obtaining  such  information,  the  Defendants  have  arrogated  to \nthemselves  the  ability  to  monitor  Schuchardt’s  communications,  and  Schuchardt’s \nbusiness and political relationships.  By doing so, the Defendants have obtained the \npower to contact and harass virtually all persons with whom Schuchardt does business.   \n118.  This power is extremely dangerous in the hands of the Defendants.  The \nDefendants are in control of a government organization that with vast police and military \npowers.   \n119.  The  Plaintiff  has  an  expectation  of  privacy  in  the  above-described \ninformation. \n  23 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 24 of 30\n120.  According to the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, the \npower to seize and monitor the communications of citizens is reserved to a court of law, \nand not to the Defendants.   \n121.  On December 16, 2013, the United States District Court for the District of \nColumbia found the Defendants' seizure of phone call metadata was unlawful under the \nFourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.   See Klayman v. Obama, Case No. \n1:13-cv-00851-RJL (D.C. Cir. 2013). \n122.  According to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, this Court has the power to adjudicate a \ndispute between the Plaintiff and the Defendants involving any issue involving federal law. \n  WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter \nan order (a) enjoining the Defendants from engaging in any further collection of the \nmetadata for the phone calls made through Verizon by the Plaintiff and the Nationwide \nClass,  and  (b)  establishing  procedures  to  ensure  that  the  Defendants  refrain  from \nunlawful conduct in the future.   \nCOUNT III \nInjunctive Relief \nIntrusion / Invasion of Privacy \n123.  The  Plaintiff  incorporates  by  reference  all  of  the  above  paragraphs  as \nthough set forth herein in their entirety. \n124.  The Plaintiff has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the above-described \ncommunications being collected by the Defendants.   \n125.  The Defendants have knowingly and intentionally invaded the privacy of the \nPlaintiff -- and have intruded upon the private affairs of the Plaintiff -- in violation of \nPennsylvania law.   \n  24 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 25 of 30\n126.  The Defendants’ conduct is illegal under the laws of the federal government \nand the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   \n127.  The Defendants are aware that their conduct is unlawful.   \n128.  It is unclear whether monetary damages will be sufficient to compensate the \nPlaintiff.   \n129.  The Defendants have already compromised, or caused the termination of, \nall secure e-mail communication services based in the United States.    \n130.  Upon information and belief, the Defendants have also compromised the \nsecurity of the cloud storage services, Dropbox and Microsoft’s Skydrive.   \n131.  Given the dearth of secure, alternative e-mail and cloud storage services \navailable in the United States, the Plaintiff respectfully seeks injunctive relief against the \nDefendants.     \n  WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter \nan order (a) enjoining the Defendants from engaging in any further collection of the \nabove-described confidential information of the Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class, and (b) \nestablishing procedures to ensure that the Defendants refrain from unlawful conduct in \nthe future.    \nCOUNT IV \nDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief \nViolation of the First Amendment \nBulk Collection of E-mail and Verizon Metadata \n132.  The  Plaintiff  incorporates  by  reference  all  of  the  above  paragraphs  as \nthough set forth herein in their entirety. \n  25 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 26 of 30\n133.  According to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, this Court has the power to adjudicate a \ndispute between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants involving any issue involving federal \nlaw.  \n134.  The Defendants are collecting the actual content of the Plaintiff’s e-mail and \nthe metadata associated with the Plaintiff’s phone calls made through Verizon.  \n135.  In  doing  so,  the  Defendants  have  violated  the  First  Amendment  of  the \nUnited States constitution.  Such amendment states as follows: \nCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, \nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of \nspeech,  or  of  the  press;  or  the  right  of  the  people  peaceably  to \nassemble,  and  to  petition  the  Government  for  a  redress  of \ngrievances. \n1st Amend.  \n136.  The Plaintiff is no longer able to freely express himself by means of e-mail \nor documents stored by means of internet cloud services because the Defendants are \ncollecting and data-mining such documents.  \n137.  In preparing this complaint, the Plaintiff was not able to use e-mail to consult \nwith certain persons, even though the proposed communications would be entirely lawful.  \nThis  is  because  the  Defendants  could  provide  such  communications  directly  to  the \nlawyers representing the government in this lawsuit.   \n138.  The  Defendants  have  also  interfered  with  the  Plaintiff’s  ability  to  freely \nassociate with other persons, because the Defendants have unilaterally obtained, without \na warrant, phone and internet data showing with whom the Plaintiff associates.  \n139.  If the Defendants’ conduct is allowed to continue, it is possible that future \nAmerican governments will use such information to blackmail or target political enemies.   \n  26 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 27 of 30\n  WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court enter \nan order (a) enjoining the Defendants from engaging in any further collection of the \nabove-described  information  about  the  Plaintiff  and  the  Nationwide  Class,  and  (b) \nestablishing procedures to ensure that the Defendants refrain from unlawful conduct in \nthe future.    \nCOUNT V \nDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief \nViolation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \n140.  The  Plaintiff  incorporates  by  reference  all  of  the  above  paragraphs  as \nthough set forth herein in their entirety. \n141.  According to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, this Court has the power to adjudicate a \ndispute between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants involving any issue involving federal \nlaw.  \n142.  The  Plaintiff  is  aggrieved  by  the  above-described  conduct  of  the \nDefendants.  \n143.  If the Defendants are purporting to act pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, then it appears that the Defendants are in violation of such act.   \n144.  According  to  50  U.S.C.  § 1861(b)(2)(B),  the  Defendants  are  required  to \nutilize “minimization procedures” with respect to information that is inadvertently obtained \nconcerning an “unconsenting United States person” during an investigation relating to \ninternational terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. \n145.  On  July  29,  2009,  Attorney  General  Eric  Holder  adopted  minimization \nprocedures that allowed the Defendants to retain the Plaintiff's confidential and valuable \ninformation for a period of up to five years, and possibly longer.  \n  27 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 28 of 30\n146.  Such  minimization  procedures  were  kept  secret  from  the  Plaintiff  until \nrecently.   \n147.  The minimization procedures adopted by the Attorney General are unlawful, \nand do not comply with the federal law. \n148.  The  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Act  does  not  contemplate,  or \nauthorize, the retention of the Plaintiff's confidential information for a period of five years.  \n  WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class respectfully request that this \nHonorable  Court  enter  an  order  determining  that  the  maximum  duration  of  the \nminimization procedures under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, as it applies to \nthe confidential information of the Plaintiff and the Nationwide Class, is substantially less \nthan five years.     \nCOUNT VI \nCivil Liability \n18 U.S.C. § 1810 \n149.  The  Plaintiff  incorporates  by  reference  all  of  the  above  paragraphs  as \nthough set forth herein in their entirety. \n150.  According  to  18  U.S.C.  § 1810,  the  Defendants  are  civilly  liable  to  the \nPlaintiff for having unlawfully collected the Plaintiff’s private communications and private \ndata.  Such statute provides as follows: \n§ 1810. Civil liability \nAn aggrieved person, other than a foreign power or an agent of a \nforeign power, as defined in section 101(a) or (b)(1)(A) [50 USCS § \n1801(a) or (b)(1)(A)], respectively, who has been subjected to an \nelectronic  surveillance  or  about  whom  information  obtained  by \nelectronic surveillance of such person has been disclosed or used in \nviolation of section 109 [50 USCS § 1809] shall have a cause of \n  28 \n\nCase 2:14-cv-00705-CB   Document 19   Filed 11/24/14   Page 29 of 30\naction against any person who committed such violation and shall be \nentitled to recover-- \n(a)  actual damages, but not less than liquidated damages of $ 1,000 \nor $ 100 per day for each day of violation, whichever is greater; \n(b)  punitive damages; and \n(c)  reasonable attorney's fees and other investigation and litigation \ncosts reasonably incurred. \n18 U.S.C. § 1810 (2014).   \n151.  The Defendants have violated such act by collecting and data mining the \nPlaintiff’s private communications and documents.    \n152.

Elliott \nSchuchardt  appeals  an  order  of  the  United  States  District \nCourt for the Western District of Pennsylvania dismissing his \ncivil action for lack of jurisdiction. The District Court held \nthat Schuchardt lacked standing to sue because he failed to \nplead facts from which one might reasonably infer that his \nown  communications  had  been  seized  by  the  federal \ngovernment. Because we hold that, at least as a facial matter, \nSchuchardt’s second amended complaint plausibly stated an \ninjury in fact personal to him, we will vacate  the District \nCourt’s order and remand.  \n  I \nSchuchardt’s  appeal  is  the  latest  in  a  line  of  cases \nraising  the  question  of  a  plaintiff’s  standing  to  challenge \nsurveillance authorized by Section 702. Congress amended \nFISA in 2008 to “supplement[] pre-existing FISA authority \nby creating a new framework under which the Government \nmay . . .  target[]  the  communications  of  non-U.S.  persons \nlocated abroad.” Clapper v. Amnesty International USA, 133 \nS. Ct. 1138, 1144 (2013); see also FISA Amendments Act of \n2008, Pub. L. No. 110–261, 122 Stat. 2436, 2438, 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1881a.  On  the  day  Section  702  became  law,  its \n3 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 4      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nconstitutionality  was  challenged  by  “attorneys  and  human \nrights,  labor,  legal,  and  media  organizations  whose  work \nallegedly require[d] them to engage in . . . telephone and e-\nmail  communications”  with  persons  located  outside  the \nUnited States. See id. at 1145. The Clapper plaintiffs claimed \nthat  Section  702  was  facially  unconstitutional  under  the \nFourth Amendment,  which prohibits unreasonable searches \nand seizures. See id. at 1146. \nA \nThe  dispositive  question  presented  to  the  Supreme \nCourt in Clapper was whether the plaintiffs had established \nan “imminent” injury “fairly traceable” to the government’s \nconduct under Section 702. See 133 S. Ct. at 1147. Because \nthe plaintiffs had brought suit on the day the law was enacted, \nthere was no evidence that their communications had been \nintercepted—there  was  only  a  looming  “threat  of  [future] \nsurveillance.”  Id.  at  1145–46.  Nonetheless,  the  plaintiffs \nclaimed they had standing because there was an “objectively \nreasonable likelihood” that their communications would be \nintercepted based on the nature of their contacts with persons \noutside of the country. Id at 1146. \nThe  Supreme  Court  rejected  this  argument  as \n“inconsistent”  with  longstanding  precedent  requiring  that \n“threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute \ninjury  in  fact,”  Clapper,  133  S.  Ct.  at  1147  (emphasis  in \noriginal) (quoting Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S 149, 158 \n(1990)).  And  because  the  plaintiffs  could  rely  only  on  a \n“speculative chain of possibilities” to support their allegations \nof future harm from unlawful government surveillance, they \nfailed  to  demonstrate  an  injury  that  was  “certainly \nimpending.” Id. at 1150.  \n4 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 5      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nIn  particular,  the  Court  characterized  the  Clapper \nplaintiffs’  “speculative  chain”  as  entailing  five  inferential \nleaps: \n(1)  the  Government  will  decide  to  target  the \ncommunications  of  non-U.S.  persons  with \nwhom [the plaintiffs] communicate; \n(2) in doing so, the Government will choose to \ninvoke its authority under [Section 702] rather \nthan . . . another method of surveillance; \n(3)  the  Article  III  judges  who  serve  on  the \nForeign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court  will \nconclude  that  the  Government’s  proposed \nsurveillance  procedures . . .  satisfy  [Section \n702’s] many safeguards and are consistent with \nthe Fourth Amendment; \n(4) the Government will succeed in intercepting \nthe communications of [the plaintiffs’] contacts; \nand  \n(5)  [the  plaintiffs]  will  be  parties  to  the \nparticular communications that the Government \nintercepts. \n133 S. Ct. at 1148.  \n  On summary judgment, the plaintiffs had failed to “set \nforth by affidavit or other evidence specific facts” supporting \nthese  inferences.  Id.  at  1149  (internal  quotation  marks \nomitted). Accordingly, they lacked standing to challenge the \nconstitutionality of Section 702. Id. \n5 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 6      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nB \nSoon  after  Clapper  was  decided,  former  NSA \ncontractor  Edward  Snowden  leaked  a  trove  of  classified \ndocuments to journalists writing for the Washington Post and \nGuardian.1 Those documents referenced the existence of an \nNSA  program  engaged  in  the  bulk  collection  of  domestic \ntelephone  metadata,  i.e.,  “details  about  telephone  calls, \nincluding for example, the length of a call, the phone number \nfrom which the call was made, and the phone number called,” \nbut not the voice content of the call itself. ACLU v. Clapper, \n785 F.3d 787, 793 (2d Cir. 2015); see also Smith v. Obama, \n816 F.3d 1239, 1241 (9th Cir. 2016); Obama v. Klayman, 800 \nF.3d 559, 561 (D.C. Cir. 2015). The operational parameters of \nthe program  were  summarized in a classified order  of the \nForeign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court  (FISC)  directed  at \nVerizon Business Network Services. ACLU, 785 F.3d at 795. \nIn short, based on Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, \nPub. L. No. 107–56, 115 Stat. 272, 287 (2001) (codified as \namended at 50 U.S.C. § 1861 et seq.), Verizon was producing \nto  the  government,  “all  call  detail  records or  ‘telephony \nmetadata’ . . . on all telephone calls made through its systems \nor using its services where one or both ends of the call are \nlocated in the United States.” ACLU, 785 F.3d at 795.  \n                                                 \n1 See, e.g., Ellen Nakashima,  Verizon Providing All \nCall Records to U.S. Under Court Order, Wash. Post (June 6, \n2013),  https://perma.cc/LZK7-37CJ;  see  also  Glenn \nGreenwald,  NSA  Collecting  Phone  Records  of  Millions  of \nVerizon  Customers  Daily,  Guardian  (June  6,  2013), \nhttps://perma.cc/UR2A-492H. \n6 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 7      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nThe  government’s  bulk  collection  of  telephone \nmetadata precipitated a number of lawsuits. In one case, the \nSecond  Circuit  held that the  government had  exceeded its \nstatutory  authority  under  Section  215  to  obtain  “relevant” \ninformation by constructing an “all-encompassing” database \nof  “every  telephone  call  made  or  received  in  the  United \nStates.”  ACLU,  785  F.3d  at  812–13.  Under  the  statute’s \nsunset  provision,  however,  authorization  for  the  bulk \ntelephone  metadata  collection  program  expired  on  June  1, \n2015.  See  Pub.  L.  No.  112–14,  125  Stat.  216  (2011) \n(authorizing  an  extension);  Smith,  816  F.3d  at  1241.  And \nalthough the program was subsequently reauthorized by the \nUSA FREEDOM Act, Pub. L. No. 114–23, 129 Stat. 268 \n(2015), that act “prohibits any further bulk collection.” Smith, \n816 F.3d at 1241. In reliance on that prohibition, the Ninth \nCircuit has determined that “claims related to the ongoing \ncollection of metadata [under Section 215] are [now] moot.” \nId. \nSeparate  and  apart  from  the  bulk  collection  of \ntelephone metadata under Section 215, the documents leaked \nto the Washington Post and Guardian also shed light on a \npreviously  undisclosed  electronic  surveillance  program \noperating under Section 702 called PRISM.2 Slides from a \npresentation  purportedly  authored  by  the  NSA  described \n                                                 \n2  See,  e.g.,  Barton  Gellman  &  Laura  Poitras,  U.S. \nBritish  Intelligence  Mining  Data  from  Nine  U.S.  Internet \nCompanies in Broad Secret Program, Wash. Post (June 7, \n2013),  https://perma.cc/YJU2-U9TZ;  Glenn  Greenwald  & \nEwan MacAskill, NSA Prism Program Taps in to User Data \nof  Apple,  Google  and  Others,  Guardian  (June  7,  2013), \nhttps://perma.cc/RPA9-RXSY \n7 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 8      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nPRISM  as  “collect[ing]  directly  from  the  servers”  the  full \ncontent  of  user  communications  exchanged  using  services \nprovided  by  several  large  U.S.  companies—including \nMicrosoft, Google, Yahoo, Apple, and Facebook. App. 53. \nAnother slide depicted a timeline showing the inception of \nPRISM  collection  from  each  company,  beginning  with \nMicrosoft  in  September  2007  and  ending  with  Apple  in \nOctober 2012. Yet another slide suggested a slogan for the \nNSA’s “New Collection Posture”: “Sniff it All, Know it All, \nCollect it All, Process it All, Exploit it All, and Partner it \nAll.” App. 61.  \nII \nOn June 2, 2014, Schuchardt filed a complaint in the \nDistrict Court asserting constitutional, statutory, and state law \nclaims  against  the  President,  the  Director  of  National \nIntelligence,  and  the  Directors  of  the  NSA  and  Federal \nBureau of Investigation. He alleged that the Government was \nviolating the Fourth Amendment by storing his confidential \ncommunications  “in  a  computer  database,  or  through  a \ngovernment  program,  which  the  Defendants  call  ‘Prism.’” \nCivil  Complaint ¶ 22, Schuchardt v. Obama, No. 2-14-cv-\n00705-CB (W.D. Pa. June 2, 2014), ECF No. 1. He sought to \nenjoin  “the  [Government]  from  engaging  in  any  further \ncollection of . . . [his] information.” Id. ¶ 37. \nSchuchardt responded to the Government’s successive \nmotions  to  dismiss  by  amending  his  complaint  twice.  In \naddition to refining and expanding his allegations, Schuchardt \nsupplemented  his  averments  with  exhibits,  the  contents  of \nwhich fall into two general categories. First, he supported his \nallegations regarding PRISM with excerpts of the classified \nmaterials  that  were  the  focus  of  the  Washington  Post  and \n8 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 9      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nGuardian reports, as well as several of the reports themselves. \nSecond, he included affidavits filed in support of the plaintiffs \nin Jewel v. NSA (Jewel I), 965 F. Supp. 2d 1090 (N.D. Cal. \n2013), a case challenging the NSA’s interception of internet \ntraffic flowing through a telecommunications facility in San \nFrancisco pursuant to an Executive Order issued shortly after \nSeptember 11, 2001.  Id. at 1098.  Jewel I  was decided on \nremand from Jewel v. NSA, 673 F.3d 902 (9th Cir. 2011), in \nwhich the Ninth Circuit held that the plaintiffs had adequately \npleaded Article III standing to sue. See 673 F.3d at 913. The \naffidavits in Jewel I were filed by former NSA employees \nwho  asserted  that  the  agency  had,  since  September  11, \ndeveloped  an  expansive  view  of  its  own  surveillance \nauthority and the technology to back it up. See, e.g., App. 126 \n(“The  post-September  11  approach  was  that  NSA  could \ncircumvent federal statutes and the Constitution as long as \nthere was some visceral connection to looking for terrorists. . \n.  .  [The  NSA]  has,  or  is  in  the  process  of  obtaining,  the \ncapability to seize and store most electronic communications \npassing through its U.S. intercept centers.”).3  \n                                                 \n3  Schuchardt’s  second  amended  complaint  also \nasserted:  a  Fourth  Amendment  claim  challenging  the  bulk \ncollection of telephone metadata under Section 215, App. 99 \n(Count II); a Pennsylvania state-law claim, App. 100 (Count \nIII),  and a First  Amendment claim, App.  101 (Count IV), \nchallenging  both  PRISM  and  the  telephone  metadata \nprogram; and statutory claims under FISA seeking injunctive \nrelief, App. 103 (Count V), and damages, App. 104 (Count \nVI). At oral argument, Schuchardt belatedly conceded that his \nclaims regarding the bulk collection of telephone metadata \nwere mooted by the USA FREEDOM Act. See Transcript of \nOral Argument at 5, Schuchardt v. Obama, No. 15-3491 (3d \n9 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 10      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nBased on  the  record  he had compiled, Schuchardt’s \nsecond  amended  complaint  alleged  that  because  the \nGovernment  was  “intercepting,  monitoring  and  storing  the \ncontent  of  all  or  substantially  all  of  the  e-mail  sent  by \nAmerican citizens,” his own online communications had been \nseized in the dragnet. App. 82, 95–99 (emphasis added). In \nparticular, Schuchardt asserted that he was “a consumer of \nvarious  types  of  electronic  communication,  storage,  and \ninternet services,” including “the e-mail services provided by \nGoogle and Yahoo; the internet search services of Google; the \ncloud  storage  services  provided  by  Google  and  Dropbox; \n[and] the e-mail and instant message services provided by \nFacebook.”  App.  95–96.  Then,  relying  on  the  operational \ndetails of PRISM made public by the Washington Post and \nGuardian, he alleged that: (1) the Government “had obtained \ndirect access to the servers” of the companies providing him \nwith  these  services;  (2)  the  Government  was  “unlawfully \nintercepting,  accessing,  monitoring  and/or  storing  [his] \nprivate  communications  .  .  .  made  or  stored  through  such \nservices”;  and  (3)  the  Government  was  “collecting  such \ninformation  in  order  to  ‘data  mine’  the  nation’s  e-mail \ndatabase.” App. 84, 95–97.  \n                                                                                                             \nCir.  May  17,  2016).  He  also  agreed  that  his  claim  for \nmonetary damages under FISA was barred by the doctrine of \nsovereign immunity, and that he was no longer pursuing his \nclaims under the First Amendment. Id. at 10–11. In light of \nSchuchardt’s concessions, we do not address these issues, and \nfocus solely on whether he has standing to litigate his Fourth \nAmendment  claim  for  injunctive  relief  based  on  the \nGovernment’s  alleged  bulk  collection  of  online \ncommunications under PRISM, App. 95 (Count I). \n10 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 11      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nIn its motion to dismiss Schuchardt’s second amended \ncomplaint,  the  Government  principally  took  issue  with  his \nallegation that the “NSA collects the online communications . \n. . of all Americans, including, therefore, his.” See Brief in \nSupport of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Second \nAmended Complaint at 2, Schuchardt v. Obama, No. 2-14-\ncv-00705-CB  (W.D.  Pa.  Dec.  11,  2014),  ECF  No.  21 \n(emphasis added). Specifically, the Government argued that \nbecause Section 702 authorizes the targeted surveillance of \nonly persons outside the United States, it was implausible that \nPRISM—a program operating under the authority of Section \n702—was  a  dragnet  capturing  all  the  country’s  domestic \nonline  communications.  In  support  of  its  position,  the \nGovernment cited a report on PRISM prepared by the Privacy \nand  Civil  Liberties  Oversight  Board  (PCLOB),4  an \nindependent  agency  tasked  with  “review[ing]  actions  the \nexecutive branch takes to protect the Nation from terrorism, \nensuring that the need for such actions is balanced with the \nneed  to  protect  privacy  and  civil  liberties.”  42  U.S.C. \n§ 2000ee(c)(1). Based on its review, the PCLOB determined \nthat  “[i]n  PRISM  collection,  the  government . . .  sends \nselectors—such  as  an  email  address—to  a  United  States-\nbased electronic communications service provider,” who is \nthen by law “compelled to give the communications sent to or \nfrom that selector to the government.” PCLOB Report at 33. \nFar  from  being  the  dragnet  that  Schuchardt  had  alleged, \n                                                 \n4 Privacy & Civil Liberties Oversight Board, Report on \nthe Surveillance Program Operated Pursuant to Section 702 \nof the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (July 2, 2014), \navailable  at  https://www.pclob.gov/library/702-Report.pdf \n[hereinafter PCLOB Report]. \n11 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 12      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\ntherefore,  “PRISM  collection  under  Section  702  may  be \ntargeted only at non-U.S. persons located abroad who possess \nor  are  likely  to  receive  foreign-intelligence  information.” \nBrief in Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss at 10, \nSchuchardt  v.  Obama,  No.  2-14-cv-00705-CB  (W.D.  Pa. \nAug. 11, 2014), ECF No. 8. Because none of Schuchardt’s \nallegations  suggested  that  he  or  his  associates  would  be \ntargeted as such persons, the Government argued that he had \nfailed  to  include  “well-pleaded  allegations  and  non-\nconclusory  allegations  of  fact”  necessary  to  establish  his \nstanding. Brief in Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint at 4, Schuchardt v. \nObama, No. 2-14-cv-00705-CB (W.D. Pa. Dec. 11, 2014), \nECF No. 21. \nThe District Court granted the Government’s motion to \ndismiss Schuchardt’s second amended complaint, but took a \nslightly  different  tack  than  what  the  Government  had \nsuggested.  After  considering  four  cases  examining \nconstitutional standing to sue in cases challenging national \nsecurity  surveillance—Clapper,  ACLU,  Jewel,  and \nKlayman—the Court deduced a “meaningful distinction” that \nexplained  their divergent outcomes.  Schuchardt v.  Obama, \n2015  WL  5732117,  at  *6  (W.D.  Pa.  Sept.  30,  2015).  “In \nsituations where plaintiffs are able to allege with some degree \nof  particularity  that  their  own  communications  were \nspecifically targeted—for example by citing a leaked FISC \norder or relying on a detailed insider account—courts have \nconcluded  that  the  particularity  requirement  has  been \nsatisfied.” Id. “On the other hand, courts have refused to find \nstanding  based  on  naked  averments  that  an  individual’s \ncommunications  must  have  been  seized  because  the \ngovernment  operates  a  data  collection  program  and  the \n12 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 13      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nindividual utilized the service of a large telecommunications \ncompany.” Id.  \nApplying the pleading standard it had gleaned from \nClapper,  ACLU,  Jewel,  and  Klayman,  the  District  Court \nbegan  by  noting  that  the  facts  underpinning  Schuchardt’s \nallegations were drawn almost entirely from “media reports \nand  publicly  available  information.”  Id.  Accordingly,  his \nlawsuit fell “squarely within the second category” of cases, \ni.e.,  those  brought  by  plaintiffs  who  lacked  Article  III \nstanding. Id. Furthermore, Schuchardt “had identified no facts \nfrom which the Court reasonably might infer that his own \ncommunications have been targeted, seized, or stored.” Id. As \nsuch, he was “indistinguishable from every other American \nsubscribing  to  the  services  of  a  major  telephone  and/or \ninternet  service  provider.”  Id.  His  “only  discernible \ndistinction  [was]  his  heightened  personal-interest  in  the \nsubject,”  which  was  “insufficient  to  confer  standing.”  Id. \n(citing Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 \nU.S. 208, 220 (1974)). \nIII \nThe District Court had jurisdiction over Schuchardt’s \nclaims under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, as well as the inherent power \nto  ascertain  its  own  jurisdiction.  See  Arbaugh  v.  Y.  &  H. \nCorp., 546 U.S. 500, 514 (2006). We have jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. § 1291. See also Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch. \nDist., 475 U.S. 534, 541–42 (1986). We review de novo the \nDistrict  Court’s  order  dismissing  Schuchardt’s  second \namended complaint. See Fleisher v. Standard Ins. Co., 679 \nF.3d 116, 120 (3d Cir. 2012).  \n13 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 14      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nAt  the  outset,  we  note  that  there  is  an  important \ndistinction between “facial” and “factual” attacks on subject \nmatter jurisdiction raised in a motion under Rule 12(b)(1) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Mortensen v. First \nFed. Sav. & Loan, 549 F.2d 884, 891 (3d Cir. 1977). In a \nfacial attack, we review only “the allegations of the complaint \nand documents referenced therein and attached thereto, in the \nlight most favorable to the plaintiff.” Gould Elecs. v. United \nStates, 220 F.3d 169, 176 (3d Cir. 2000). If, however, the \ndefendant contests the pleaded jurisdictional facts, “the court \nmust permit the plaintiff to respond with evidence supporting \njurisdiction.” Id. at 177 (citing Int’l Ass’n of Machinists & \nAerospace Workers v. Nw. Airlines, Inc., 673 F.2d 700, 711–\n12  (3d  Cir.  1982)).  “The  court  may  then  determine \njurisdiction  by  weighing  the  evidence  presented  by  the \nparties,” but “if there is a dispute of a material fact, the court \nmust conduct a plenary trial on the contested facts prior to \nmaking a jurisdictional determination.” Id.  \nIt is clear from the record in this case that the District \nCourt viewed the Government’s motion to dismiss as a facial \nattack on its jurisdiction. The Court’s analysis focused solely \non  Schuchardt’s  second  amended  complaint;  it  did  not \nconsider  any  extrinsic  facts  proffered  by  the  Government, \nincluding, for example, the nature of PRISM collection as \ndetermined  by  the  PCLOB.  See  Schuchardt,  2015  WL \n5732117, at *5–7.  Accordingly,  our review of the District \nCourt’s order will accept as true all of Schuchardt’s plausible \nallegations, and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.5  \n                                                 \n5 Schuchardt has also challenged on appeal the District \nCourt’s  order  denying  his  request  for  a  preliminary \ninjunction,  a  decision  the  Court  rendered  more  than  six \n14 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 15      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nIV \nWe  begin  our  analysis  with  first  principles.  As  a \nplaintiff  seeking  to  invoke  federal  jurisdiction,  Schuchardt \nbears the burden of establishing each element of his standing \nto sue under Article III. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, \n504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). “[T]he irreducible constitutional \nminimum of standing contains three elements.” Id. at 560. \nFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an injury \nin  fact—an  invasion  of  a  legally  protected \ninterest which is (a) concrete and particularized, \nand (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or \nhypothetical. Second,  there  must  be  a  causal \nconnection between the injury and the conduct \ncomplained  of—the  injury  has  to  be  fairly \ntraceable  to  the  challenged  action  of  the \ndefendant, and not the result of the independent \naction of some third party not before the court. \nThird, it must be likely, as opposed to merely \nspeculative, that the injury will be redressed by \na favorable decision.  \nId.  at  560–61  (internal  quotation  marks,  citations,  and \nalterations omitted).  \n                                                                                                             \nmonths before granting the Government’s motion to dismiss. \nBecause Schuchardt failed to identify that unrelated order in \nhis notice of appeal, however, we lack jurisdiction to consider \nhis arguments. See Sulima v. Tobyhanna Army Depot, 602 \nF.3d 177, 184 (3d Cir. 2010). \n15 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 16      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nBecause a motion to dismiss raising a facial attack on \nsubject matter jurisdiction relies solely on the pleadings, “we \napply the same standard of review we use when assessing a \nmotion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.” See Finkelman \nv. NFL, 810 F.3d 187, 194 (3d Cir. 2016). “Thus, to survive a \nmotion to dismiss for lack of standing, a plaintiff must allege \nfacts  that  affirmatively  and  plausibly  suggest  that  [he] \nhas standing to sue.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). \nThat is, the plaintiff must “plausibly allege facts establishing \neach constitutional requirement.” Hassan v. City of New York, \n804 F.3d 277, 289 (3d Cir. 2015); see also Spokeo, Inc. v. \nRobins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016).  \nAgainst this doctrinal backdrop, Schuchardt’s Article \nIII standing turns on two inquiries. First, were his allegations \nsufficiently “particularized” to demonstrate that he suffered a \ndiscrete injury? See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560. Second, were \nthose  facts  pleaded  with  enough  detail  to  render  them \nplausible,  “well-pleaded”  allegations  entitled  to  a \npresumption of truth? See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, \n681 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 554 \n(2007). We address each inquiry in turn. \nA \nA  “particularized”  Article  III  injury  is  one  that \n“affect[s] the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.” In re \nSchering  Plough  Corp.  Intron/Temodar  Consumer  Class \nAction, 678 F.3d 235, 245 (3d Cir. 2012) (quoting Lujan, 504 \nU.S. at 560 n.1). That putative litigants must suffer in some \ndiscrete  and personal  fashion ensures, first, that “the legal \nquestions presented . . . will be resolved, not in the rarified \natmosphere of a debating society, but in a concrete factual \ncontext  conducive  to  a  realistic  appreciation  of  the \n16 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 17      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nconsequences  of  judicial  action,”  and,  second,  that  our \n“exercise of judicial power” shows “[p]roper regard for the . . \n. other two coequal branches of the Federal Government.” \nValley  Forge  Christian  Coll.  v.  Ams.  United  for  the \nSeparation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 471–74 \n(1982). These two concerns—respect for the judicial role and \nseparation of powers—are most salient when courts are asked \n“to review actions of the political branches in the fields of \nintelligence gathering and foreign affairs.” Clapper, 133 S. \nCt. at 1147. \nThe Supreme Court has identified a subset of cases in \nwhich plaintiffs routinely fail to demonstrate particularized \ninjury  because  they  present  only  “generalized  grievances,” \ni.e., injuries that are  “undifferentiated  and  ‘common to all \nmembers of the public.’” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 573–74 (quoting \nUnited  States  v.  Richardson,  418  U.S.  166,  177  (1974)). \n“Whether  styled  as  a  constitutional  or  prudential  limit  on \nstanding,  the  Court  has  sometimes  determined  that  where \nlarge numbers of Americans suffer alike, the political process, \nrather  than  the  judicial  process,  may  provide  the  more \nappropriate  remedy.”  Fed.  Election  Comm’n  v.  Akins,  524 \nU.S.  11,  23  (1998).  Such  cases  often  involve  government \naction directed at the public at large, or harms that by their \nnature touch upon interests that are widely shared. See, e.g., \nSchlesinger, 418 U.S. at 217 (plaintiffs asserting violation of \nthe  Incompatibility  Clause  by  members  of  Congress  also \nserving in the armed reserves lacked standing because their \nonly interest was “to have the Judicial Branch compel the \nExecutive Branch to act in conformity with the [law] . . . an \ninterest shared by all citizens”); Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 \nU.S.  727,  734–36  (1972)  (association  challenging \n17 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 18      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\ndevelopment  of  national  park  lacked  standing  based  on \nalleged “special interest” in conservation). \nNevertheless, “[t]he fact that an injury may be suffered \nby  a large number  of people does not  of itself make that \ninjury a nonjusticiable generalized grievance.” Spokeo, 136 S. \nCt. at 1548 n.7. “The victims’ injuries from a mass tort, for \nexample, are widely shared, to be sure, but each individual \nsuffers a particularized harm.” Id.; see also Massachusetts v. \nEPA, 549 U.S. 497, 526 n.24 (2007) (“[S]tanding is not to be \ndenied  simply  because  many  people  suffer  the  same \ninjury. . . .  To  deny  standing  to  persons  who  are  in  fact \ninjured simply because many others are also injured, would \nmean  that  the  most  injurious  and  widespread  Government \nactions  could  be  questioned  by  nobody.”).  And  although \nparticularity  and  concreteness  are  distinct  elements \nconstituting injury in fact, see Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1545, the \nSupreme Court has also observed that the “judicial language” \naccompanying generalized grievances “invariably appears in \ncases where the harm is not only widely shared, but also of an \nabstract  or  indefinite  nature—for  example,  harm  to  the \n‘common concern for obedience to law.’” Akins, 524 U.S. at \n23 (emphasis added).  \nWe applied these principles in a recent case involving \nallegations of government surveillance. In Hassan v. City of \nNew  York,  the  plaintiffs  claimed  that  the  New  York  City \nPolice Department (NYPD) had implemented a program “to \nmonitor  the  lives  of  Muslims,  their  businesses,  houses  of \nworship, organizations, and schools.” 804 F.3d at 285. The \nprogram  allegedly  entailed  “widespread”  photo  and  video \nsurveillance of “organizations and businesses . . . visibly or \nopenly affiliated with Islam,” and the infiltration of “Muslim-\naffiliated”  groups  with  informants  and  undercover  police \n18 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 19      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nofficers.  Id.  at  285–86.  The  information  gathered  was \ncompiled  into  a  series  of  reports  “document[ing]  .  .  . \nAmerican  Muslim  life  in  painstaking  detail.”  Id.  (internal \nquotation marks omitted). The Hassan plaintiffs discovered \nthe  program  after  some  of  these  reports  became  “widely \npublicized,” and they asserted that the fallout required them \nto alter their ordinary day-to-day conduct. See id. at 287–88. \nWe held that the plaintiffs’ allegations in Hassan were \nsufficient to demonstrate particularized injury under Article \nIII. After determining that they had asserted “an invasion of a \nlegally protected interest”—“[t]he indignity of being singled \nout [by the government] for special burdens on the basis of \none’s religious calling”—we observed that the particularized \nnature of an injury does not turn on the number of persons \nthat may claim it. Id. at 289. “[T]hat hundreds or thousands \n(or even millions) of other persons may have suffered  the \nsame injury does not change the individualized nature of the \nasserted rights and interests at stake.” Id. at 291 (citing Akins, \n524 U.S. at 24). “Harm to all—even in the nuanced world of \nstanding law—cannot be logically equated with harm to no \none.”  Id.  And  with  regard  to  allegations  of  widespread \ngovernment surveillance, we stated that because the plaintiffs \nhad  “claim[ed]  to  be  the  very  targets  of  the  allegedly \nunconstitutional  surveillance,  they  [were]  unquestionably \n‘affect[ed] . . .  in  a  personal  and  individual  way.’”  Id. \n(quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 n.1). \nLike the plaintiffs in Hassan, Schuchardt has alleged a \nprogram of government surveillance that, though universal in \nscope, is unmistakably personal in the purported harm. His \nsecond amended complaint describes PRISM as a dragnet that \ncollects  “all  or  substantially  all  of  the  e-mail  sent  by \nAmerican citizens by means of several large internet service \n19 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 20      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nproviders.”  App.  82.  The  collected  information  allegedly \nencompasses  Schuchardt’s  personal  communications,  and \nincludes not only the kind of intensely private details that one \ncould reasonably expect to find in the email accounts of most \nAmericans—“bank  account  numbers;  credit  card  numbers; \npasswords for financial data; [and] health records”—but also \ndata  influenced  by  Schuchardt’s  personal  circumstances, \nnamely “trade secrets” and “communications with clients of \nSchuchardt’s law firm, which are privileged and confidential \nunder applicable law.” App. 96.  \nThe Government strenuously disputes the plausibility \nof  Schuchardt’s  assertion  that  PRISM  collects  “all  or \nsubstantially all of the e-mail sent by American citizens,” and \nwe address that dispute in detail below. But putting aside for \nthe moment the question of whether Schuchardt’s allegations \nconcerning PRISM are entitled to a presumption of truth, the \nconsequences  that  he  identifies  as  flowing  from  the \nGovernment’s  alleged  dragnet  are  undoubtedly  personal  to \nhim insofar as he has a constitutional right to maintain the \nprivacy of his personal communications, online or otherwise. \nSee  Plumhoff  v.  Rickard,  134  S.  Ct.  2012,  2022  (2014) \n(“Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights . . . which \nmay  not  be  vicariously  asserted.”  (quoting  Alderman  v. \nUnited States,  394 U.S. 165,  174 (1969)).  That interest is \nneither  indivisibly  abstract  nor  indefinite,  see  Warshak  v. \nUnited States, 631 F.3d 266, 288 (6th Cir. 2010), and the fact \nthat a large percentage of the population may share a similar \ninterest “does not change [its] individualized nature” because \nSchuchardt’s  allegations  make  clear  that  he  is  among  the \npersons  that  are  the  “very  targets  of  the  allegedly \nunconstitutional surveillance.” Hassan, 804 F.3d at 291; cf. \nRiley  v.  California,  134  S.  Ct.  2473,  2484–85  (2014) \n20 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 21      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\n(extending  the  warrant  requirement  to  searches  of  cellular \nphones, “which are now such a pervasive and insistent part of \ndaily life that the proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude \nthey were an important feature of human anatomy”). \nB \nHaving determined that Schuchardt’s allegations stated \na  particularized  injury  under  Article  III,  we  now  consider \nwhether those allegations should be credited as true for the \npurpose  of  resolving  the  Government’s  jurisdictional \nobjection. As noted previously, the District Court construed \nthe Government’s motion to dismiss as a facial attack on its \nsubject  matter  jurisdiction.  As  a  result,  we  must  accept \nSchuchardt’s allegations as true, with the important caveat \nthat the presumption of truth attaches only to those allegations \nfor which there is sufficient “factual matter” to render them \n“plausible on [their] face.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. Conclusory \nassertions of fact and legal conclusions are not entitled to the \nsame presumption. See id.; see also Twombly, 550 U.S. at 57; \nConnelly v. Lane Constr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 787 (3d Cir. \n2016) (“Under the pleading regime established by Twombly \nand Iqbal, a court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint \nmust . . . identify allegations that, ‘because they are no more \nthan conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.’” \n(quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679)).6 \n                                                 \n6  We  have  instructed  courts  to  follow  a  three-step \nprocess  to  determine  the  sufficiency  of  a  complaint  in \naccordance with Twombly and Iqbal. “First, [the court] must \ntake note of the elements the plaintiff must plead to state a \nclaim.  Second,  it  should  identify  allegations  that,  because \nthey are  no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the \n21 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 22      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\n1 \nWe  have  recognized  that  “[t]he  plausibility \ndetermination  is  a  ‘context-specific  task  that  requires  the \nreviewing  court  to  draw  on  its  judicial  experience  and \ncommon  sense.’”  See,  e.g.,  Connelly,  809  F.3d  at  786–87 \n(quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 675). At the same time, we have \ncautioned  that  the  plausibility  standard  does  not  impose  a \nheightened  pleading requirement,  and that  Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 8(a) continues to require only a “showing” \nthat the pleader is entitled to relief. See, e.g., Phillips v. Cty. \nof Allegheny, 515 F.3d  224, 233–34 (3d Cir. 2008) (“The \n[Supreme]  Court  emphasized  .  .  .  that  it  was  neither \ndemanding a heightened pleading of specifics nor imposing a \nprobability  requirement.”)).  Indeed,  although  Twombly  and \nIqbal emphasized the plaintiff’s burden of pleading sufficient \n“factual  matter,”  the  Supreme  Court  also  expressly \n“disavow[ed]” the requirement that a plaintiff plead “specific \nfacts.” Boykin v. KeyCorp, 521 F.3d 202, 215 (2d Cir. 2008) \n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 569, and Erickson v. Pardus, \n551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007)).  \nImplicit in the notion that a plaintiff need not plead \n“specific facts” to survive a motion to dismiss is that courts \ncannot  inject  evidentiary  issues  into  the  plausibility \n                                                                                                             \nassumption  of  truth.  Finally,  when  there  are  well-pleaded \nfactual allegations, the court should assume their veracity and \nthen  determine  whether  they  plausibly  give  rise  to  an \nentitlement  to  relief.”  Connelly,  809  F.3d  at  787  &  n.4 \n(internal  citations,  quotations  marks,  and  original \nmodifications omitted). \n22 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 23      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\ndetermination.7 See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556 (“[A] well-\npleaded  complaint  may  proceed  even  if  it  strikes  a  savvy \njudge that actual proof of those facts is improbable.”). This \nincludes  the  weighing  of  facts  or  the  requirement  that  a \nplaintiff plead “specific facts” beyond those necessary to state \na  valid  claim.  See  id.  at  573  n.8  (“[W]hen  a  complaint \nadequately states a claim, it may not be dismissed based on a \ndistrict court’s assessment that the plaintiff will fail to find \nevidentiary support for his allegations or prove his claim to \nthe satisfaction of the factfinder.”). The same logic precludes \na court from rejecting pleaded facts based on some blanket \nexclusion of evidence. See Ricciuti v. New York City Transit \nAuth., 941 F.2d 119, 124 (2d Cir. 1991). “A contrary rule \n                                                 \n7  The  “evidentiary  issues”  to  which  we  refer  are \ndistinct  from  the  question  of  what  documents  may  be \nconsidered  in  resolving  a  motion  to  dismiss  applying  the \nstandard of review under Rule 12(b)(6), or, as relevant here, \naddressing  a  facial  challenge  to  subject  matter  jurisdiction \nunder  Rule  12(b)(1).  The  general  rule  for  determining  the \nscope of the pleadings in this scenario is that a district court \n“may  consider  only  the  allegations  contained  in  the \npleading[s] to determine [their] sufficiency,” but is permitted \nto consider “document[s] integral to or explicitly relied upon \nin the complaint,” and “any undisputedly authentic document \nthat a defendant attaches . . . if the plaintiff’s claims are based \non the document,” without converting the motion into one for \nsummary judgment. See In re Asbestos Prods. Liability Litig. \n(No. VI), 822 F.3d 125, 133 & n.7 (3d Cir. 2016) (internal \ncitations  and  quotation  marks  omitted).  See  generally  5B \nCharles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice \nand Procedure § 1350 n.1 (3d ed. 2016).   \n23 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 24      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nwould  confuse  the  principles  applicable  to  a  motion  to \ndismiss  with  those  governing  a  motion  for  summary \njudgment.” Campanella v. Cty. of Monroe, 853 F. Supp. 2d \n364, 378 (W.D.N.Y. 2012); see also Whitney v. Guys, Inc., \n700 F.3d 1118, 1128–29 (8th Cir. 2012). \nAccordingly, although it is unclear whether the District \nCourt applied a heightened pleading standard in this case, to \nthe extent that its opinion suggests that Schuchardt’s reliance \non “media reports and other publicly-available information” \nwas impermissible, we disagree.8 See Schuchardt, 2015 WL \n5732117, at *6. Indeed, we held that the plaintiffs in Hassan \nhad plausibly pleaded both their standing to sue and claims \nfor  relief  based  on  NYPD  surveillance  reports  that  the \nplaintiffs had discovered only after they had been “widely \npublicized.”  See  804  F.3d  at  287.  Similarly,  we  take  the \n                                                 \n8  Despite  Clapper’s  observation  that  the  standing \ninquiry  is  “especially  rigorous”  in  matters  touching  on \n“intelligence  gathering  and  foreign  affairs,”  133  S.  Ct.  at \n1147, to our knowledge no court has imposed a heightened \npleading standard for cases implicating national security. See \nJewel, 673 F.3d at 913 (“Article III imposes no heightened \nstanding requirement for the often difficult cases that involve \nconstitutional  claims  against  the  executive  involving \nsurveillance.”).  In  this  appeal,  we  will  assume  without \ndeciding that a heightened pleading standard does not apply. \nSee,  e.g.,  Jones  v.  Bock,  549  U.S.  199,  212–13  (2007) \n(explaining that “courts should generally not depart from the \nusual  practice  under  the  Federal  Rules  on  the  basis  of \nperceived  policy  concerns,”  including  the  imposition  of  a \npleading standard more stringent than the “short and plain \nstatement” of the claim under Rule 8). \n24 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 25      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nDistrict Court’s enumeration of the types of evidence giving \nrise to the plaintiffs’ standing in Jewel and ACLU—“a leaked \nFISC  order  or  a  detailed  insider  account”—as  merely  a \nsuggestion of facts that would have strongly supported the \nplausibility  of  Schuchardt’s  allegations,  rather  than  a \nrequirement that he plead those specific facts. See 2015 WL \n6732117, at *6. Such limitations on the scope or source of \nfacts  that  a  plaintiff  may  plead  to  reach  the  threshold  of \nplausibility  run  counter  to  the  longstanding  principles \nanimating pretrial dispositions, as set forth in Twombly and \nIqbal,  and  come  close  to  the  weighing  of  evidence  and \ncredibility determinations that are the exclusive province of \nthe  factfinder.  See  Iqbal,  556  U.S.  at  681  (“It  is  the \nconclusory  nature  of  respondent’s  allegations,  rather  than \ntheir extravagantly fanciful nature, that disentitles them to the \npresumption of truth.”); Twombly, 550 U.S. at  556 (“Rule \n12(b)(6)  does  not  countenance  .  .  .  dismissals  based  on  a \njudge’s  disbelief  of  a  complaint’s  factual  allegations.” \n(quoting Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 327 (1989)); see \nalso  Anderson  v.  Liberty  Lobby,  Inc.,  477  U.S.  242,  255 \n(1986).  \nThe  upshot  of  all  this  for  Schuchardt  is  that  his \nreliance  on  news  articles  and  other  disclosures  concerning \nPRISM weighs neither in his favor nor against him. Instead, \nthese  public  reports  (and  the  leaked  classified  materials \naccompanying  them)  are  simply  part  and  parcel  of  the \n“factual  matter”  that  must  be  considered  in  assessing  the \nplausibility  of  his  allegations.  We  will  therefore  examine \nthose  reports  in  conjunction  with  the  rest  of  Schuchardt’s \npleadings  to  ascertain  whether  he  plausibly  alleged  a \nparticularized injury under Article III. \n25 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 26      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\n2 \nBased on our review of the pleadings, the plausibility \nof  Schuchardt’s  alleged  injury—that  the  Government  has \nbeen “unlawfully intercepting, accessing, monitoring and/or \nstoring [his] private communications,” App. 95—depends on \nthe plausibility of his assertion that PRISM functions as an \nindiscriminate dragnet which captures “all or substantially all \nof the e-mail sent by American citizens.” App. 82. Aside from \nthis  sweeping  allegation,  Schuchardt  has  supplied  no  facts \nsuggesting how (or why) the Government would have been \ninterested in his online activity. His burden, therefore, was to \nallege  enough  “factual  matter”  to  make  plausible  the \nGovernment’s virtual dragnet. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679; see also \nArpaio v. Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 19 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nSchuchardt  pleaded  facts  drawn  from  news  articles \npublished  by  the  Guardian,  as  well  as  the  leaked  and \npurportedly  classified  materials  from  which  those  articles \nwere  derived.  As  we  noted  in  Part  I.B,  supra,  these \ndocuments state that the NSA, through PRISM, has obtained \n“direct”  access  to  the  technical  facilities  of  several  major \ninternet service providers. App. 53, 84. They indicate specific \ndates  for  when  those  providers  granted  the  Government \naccess, App. 60, and that the degree of access those providers \ngranted enables the Government to query their facilities at \nwill  for  “real-time  interception  of  an  individual’s  internet \nactivity.” App. 66. They also describe the types of activity \nthat may be accessed, encompassing “both the content and \nmetadata of . . . private e-mail communications” sent by those \nproviders on behalf of their subscribers. App. 59, 96. Finally, \nthey claim that the rate of data “[c]ollection is outpacing [the \nGovernment’s] ability to ingest, process and store [the data] \nto the ‘norms’ to which [it has] become accustomed,” App. \n26 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 27      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\n64,  and  that  the  NSA’s  overriding  surveillance  goal  is  to \n“[c]ollect it [a]ll,” App. 61. \nBy  including  these  factual  averments  in  his  second \namended  complaint,  Schuchardt  outlined  a  coherent  and \nplausible case supporting his PRISM-as-dragnet allegations. \nFirst, his alleged facts specify, at least to some degree, the \nmeans through which the NSA captures “all or substantially \nall of the e-mail sent by American citizens,” App. 82, namely, \nby  compelling  companies  that  provide  email  and  other \ninternet services to cooperate with the NSA in the collection \nof  their  customers’  data.  Although  the  technical  details  of \nhow each company’s email service integrates within PRISM’s \ninfrastructure are not specified, “on a motion to dismiss, we \n‘presum[e]  that  general  allegations  embrace  those  specific \nfacts that are necessary to support the claim.’” Lujan, 504 \nU.S. at 561 (quoting Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. \n781,  889  (1990)).  Moreover,  according  to  the  NSA  itself, \nPRISM entails data “collection directly from the servers” of \nthese companies, and Schuchardt describes events involving \nLavabit, a company that resisted the Government’s demands \nto “install a device on its server which would have provided \nthe [Government] with access to the full content of all e-mail \nmessages for all of Lavabit’s . . . customers.” See App. 53, 84, \n87.  Thus,  the  pleaded  facts  plausibly  allege  the  technical \nmeans  through  which  PRISM  purportedly  achieves  a \nnationwide email dragnet.9 \n                                                 \n9 We do not read the Ninth Circuit’s opinion in Jewel \nto suggest a different conclusion. To be sure, the plaintiff in \nJewel  was  able  to  allege  “with  particularity”  that  her \ncommunications were seized by “focus[ing]” her complaint \non  interceptions  occurring  at  a  specific  technical  facility \n27 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 28      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nSecond,  Schuchardt’s  allegations  are  replete  with \ndetails  confirming  PRISM’s  operational  scope  and \ncapabilities.  The  exhibits  attached  to  his  second  amended \ncomplaint include a slide from a purported NSA presentation \nidentifying  company  names  and  the  dates  they  began \ncooperating with the agency. Another slide confirms that—\nconsistent with a dragnet capturing “all or substantially all of \nthe e-mail sent by American citizens”—the scale of the data \ncollected by PRISM is so vast that the Government reported \ndifficulty processing it according “to the ‘norms’ to which [it \nhas]  become  accustomed.”  App.  64;  see  also  App.  52 \n(characterizing PRISM as the “SIGAD Used Most in NSA \nReporting”);10  App.  61  (indicating  the  NSA’s  “New \nCollection Posture” of “Collect[ing] it All”).  \n                                                                                                             \noperated by a single telecommunications provider. See 673 \nF.3d at 910 (discussing the plaintiff’s allegations concerning \nAT&T’s  “SG3  Secure  Room”  and  “particular  electronic \ncommunications  equipment”  at  the  company’s  “Folsom \nStreet” facility in San Francisco). Although the details she \nalleged were quite colorful, they differ in degree, not in kind \nfrom Schuchardt’s averments. In both cases, the parties relied \non an insider account of the alleged surveillance program at \nissue—Schuchardt on a former NSA contractor, and Jewel on \na  former  AT&T  telecommunications  technician.  Those \ninsiders in turn have relied either on documentary evidence \nallegedly produced by the Government itself, or their personal \nexperiences in executing the surveillance program.  \n10  SIGAD  stands  for  the  term  “Signals  Intelligence \nActivity Designator,” which “is an alphanumeric designator \nthat  identifies  a  facility  used  for  collecting  Signals \nIntelligence (SIGINT).” Laura K. Donohue, Section 702 and \n28 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 29      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nFinally,  the  pleaded  facts  support  Schuchardt’s \nallegation  that  the  scope  of  PRISM’s  data  collection \nencompasses  his  personal  email.  The  NSA  presentation \nidentifies  specific  companies  participating  in  the  PRISM \nprogram, and indicates that NSA analysts receive the content \nof emails collected as part of the program. Schuchardt alleged \nthat  he  uses  email  services  provided  by  two  of  those \ncompanies—Google and Yahoo—so we need not speculate \nabout  whether  Schuchardt’s  own  communications  were \ncaptured because he specified the scope of PRISM’s dragnet \nwith enough “factual matter” to make additional inferential \nleaps unnecessary. See Klayman, 800 F.3d at 559 (opinion of \nBrown, J.) (permitting the inference that the bulk telephone \nmetadata  program  under  Section  215  encompassed  the \nplaintiff’s  communications  in  light  of  facts  alleging  “the \ngovernment’s  efforts  to  ‘create  a  comprehensive  metadata \ndatabase.’”). \n3 \nThe  Government  raises  three  principal  arguments \nchallenging  the  plausibility  of  Schuchardt’s  PRISM \nallegations. First, it argues that Clapper and its application by \nthe D.C. Circuit in Klayman require us to find his allegations \nimplausible. We disagree. \nTwo aspects of Clapper distinguish it from this case. \nFirst,  because  the  Clapper  plaintiffs  raised  a  facial \nconstitutional challenge to Section 702 on the day the statute \nwas  enacted,  they  pleaded  only  prospective  injury,  i.e., \n                                                                                                             \nthe  Collection  of  International  Telephone  and  Internet \nContent, 38 Harv. J. L. & Pub. Pol’y 117, 119 n.3 (2015). \n29 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 30      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\n“potential future surveillance.” See 133 S. Ct. at 1150. And \nbecause  that  “potential”  relied  on  a  “speculative  chain  of \npossibilities,”  the  Supreme  Court  concluded  that  they  had \nfailed to satisfy the imminence and traceability elements of \ninjury-in-fact  under  Article  III.  Here,  in  contrast, \nSchuchardt’s alleged injury has already occurred insofar as he \nclaims  the  NSA  seized  his  emails.  It  is  therefore  not \nsurprising that the Government has been unable to formulate \nan  analogous  “speculative  chain”  that  would  doom \nSchuchardt’s constitutional standing.  \nAnother  critical  distinction  between  this  case  and \nClapper is that the district court entered summary judgment, a \nprocedural posture that required the plaintiffs to identify a \ntriable  issue  of  material  fact  supported  by  an  evidentiary \nrecord. See id. at 1146, 1149. In contrast, Schuchardt sought \nto avoid dismissal in a facial jurisdictional challenge raised \nunder  Rule  12(b)(1),  which  requires  him  only  to  state  a \nplausible claim, a significantly lighter burden. This distinction \nin the standard of review is also reflected in cases concerning \nnational security surveillance from our sister courts. Compare \nACLU, 785 F.3d at 800 (plaintiffs had standing on motion to \ndismiss); Jewel, 673 F.3d at 906–07 (same), with Klayman, \n800 F.3d at 568 (opinion of Williams, J.) (plaintiffs lacked \nstanding to pursue preliminary injunction because there was \nno “substantial likelihood” that they could establish injury-in-\nfact,  observing  that  summary  judgment  imposes  a  “lighter \nburden” than the “substantial likelihood of success” necessary \nto obtain a preliminary injunction); ACLU v. NSA, 493 F.3d \n644,  650–51,  667–70  (6th  Cir.  2007)  (plaintiffs  failed  to \nestablish injury-in-fact on summary judgment because they \nhad  “no  evidence”  on  various  points  of  causation).  Here, \nSchuchardt has gone beyond mere allegations to survive a \n30 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 31      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nmotion to dismiss by creating a limited evidentiary record to \nsupport his allegations.  \nThe  Government’s  reliance  on  Klayman  is  also \nmisplaced. There, the D.C. Circuit vacated the district court’s \npreliminary injunction, holding that the plaintiffs had failed to \ndemonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. \nSee 800 F.3d at 561. However, the panel split on the issue of \nthe  plaintiffs’  standing,  and  also  disagreed  on  whether  to \nremand the case for further proceedings or outright dismissal. \nSee id. at 564 (opinion of Brown, J.) (plaintiffs had satisfied \n“the  bare  requirements  of  standing,”  remanding  for \njurisdictional discovery); id. at 565 (opinion of Williams, J.) \n(plaintiffs  lacked  standing  to  seek  preliminary  injunction, \nremanding for jurisdictional discovery); id. at 569 (opinion of \nSentelle, J.) (plaintiffs lacked  standing vel non, remanding \nwith order to dismiss). Under these circumstances, it seems \nclear to us that Klayman’s persuasive force is minimized by \nits splintered reasoning, different procedural posture, and the \nfact that the D.C. Circuit addressed itself to a now-defunct \nsurveillance program authorized by a separate provision of \nFISA. Accordingly, neither  Clapper nor  Klayman supports \nthe Government in this case. \nSecond,  the  Government  contends  that  Schuchardt’s \nallegations “say at most that the government may have the \ncapability  to  seize  and  store  most  electronic \ncommunications,” but “[t]hey do not say that the government \nis searching or seizing most, let alone all, e-mail.” Gov’t Br. \n21.  We  agree  that  Schuchardt’s  alleged  facts—even  if \nproven—do not conclusively establish that PRISM operates \nas a dragnet on the scale he has alleged. The language of the \nleaked materials Schuchardt relies on is imprecise. The use of \nthe term “direct” in the NSA’s presentation could mean, for \n31 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 32      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nexample,  that  the  Government  has  complete  discretion  to \nsearch  all  electronic  information  held  by  a  company \nparticipating  in  PRISM  at  will;  this  would  certainly  be \nconsistent with the “real-time” interception capability that the \nNSA  allegedly  possesses,  and  could  qualify  as  an \nunconstitutional  “seizure”  of  all  information  stored  on  the \ncompany’s servers. On the other hand, “direct” could mean \nthat the Government merely has the legal authority to compel \nparticipating companies to turn over “communications that \nmay  be  of  foreign-intelligence  value  because  they  are  . . . \nassociated  with  the  e-mail  addresses  that  are  used  by \nsuspected foreign terrorists.” Gov’t Br. 22. In that scenario, it \nis implausible that Schuchardt’s communications would be \ntargeted by PRISM. \nAt this early stage of litigation, however, Schuchardt is \nentitled to any inference in his favor that may be “reasonably” \ndrawn from his pleaded facts. See, e.g., King Drug Co. of \nFlorence, Inc. v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 791 F.3d 388, \n398 n.11 (3d Cir. 2015) (citing Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678–79). \nAnd  as  we  have  explained,  the  inference  that  PRISM \n“collects  all  or  substantially  all  of  the  e-mail  sent  by \nAmerican citizens,” App. 82, is one supported by his pleaded \n“factual matter.” Accordingly, in this procedural posture, we \ncannot accept the Government’s preferred inference. \nFinally,  the  Government  disputes  the  notion  that \nPRISM  is  a  dragnet,  i.e.,  that  it  is  “based  on  the \nindiscriminate collection of information in bulk.” See Gov’t \nBr. 22 (quoting PCLOB Report at  111).  According to the \nGovernment,  “the  program  consists  entirely  of  targeting \nspecific  persons  that  may  be  of  foreign-intelligence  value \nbecause  they  are,  for  example,  associated  with  the  e-mail \n32 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 33      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\naddresses that are used by suspected foreign terrorists.” Id. \nUnder this view, to intercept communications using PRISM: \nAnalysts first identify a non-U.S. person located \noutside  the  United  States  who  is  likely  to \ncommunicate  certain  types  of  foreign \nintelligence information, such as an individual \nwho belongs to a foreign terrorist organization \nor facilitates its activities. Analysts also attempt \nto identify a means by which this foreign target \ncommunicates, such as an e-mail address, or a \ntelephone number; any such address, number, \nor  other  identifier  is  known  as  a  “selector.” \nPRISM collection occurs when the government \nobtains from telecommunications providers . . .  \ncommunications  sent  to  or  from  specified \nselectors.  \nGov’t Br. 6–7 (internal citations omitted). \nSeveral commentators11 and the few courts12 that have \nexamined  PRISM  appear  to  agree  with  the  Government’s \n                                                 \n11 See, e.g., Donohue, supra note 8, at 119 n.2 (“Once \nforeign  intelligence  acquisition  has  been  authorized  under \nSection  702,  the  government  sends  written  directives  to \nelectronic communication service providers compelling their \nassistance  in  the  acquisition  of  communications.”  (quoting \nPCLOB  Report  at  7));  Nathan  Alexander  Sales, \nDomesticating  Programmatic  Surveillance:  Some  Thoughts \non the NSA Controversy, 10 I/S: J. L. & Pol’y for Info. Soc’y \n523, 526 (2014) (“[In] PRISM . . . the NSA targets specific \nnon-Americans  who  are  reasonably  believed  to  be  located \noutside the country, and also engages in bulk collection of \n33 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 34      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nview  of  the  program’s  “targeted”  nature.  So  too  has  the \nPCLOB, whose report on PRISM the Government has asked \nus  to  consider.  See  PCLOB  Report  at  33–34.  These \nauthorities  are  substantial,  and  if  correct,  would  tend  to \n                                                                                                             \nsome foreign-to-foreign communications that happen to be \npassing  through  telecommunications  infrastructure  in  the \nUnited  States.”).  The  Washington  Post  also  amended  its \ninitial report on PRISM to suggest that “imprecision on the \npart of the NSA” in the wording of its presentation left open \nthe possibility that PRISM collection still required the agency \nto request materials from the participating companies, rather \nthan directly from the companies’ servers. See Jonathan Hall, \nWashington Post Updates, Hedges on Initial PRISM Report, \nForbes  (June  7,  2013,  9:08  PM),  https://perma.cc/7L6A-\nH22D.  \n12 See, e.g., United States v. Hasbajrami, 2016 WL \n1029500,  at  *6  (E.D.N.Y.  Mar.  8,  2016)  (“In  PRISM \ncollection,  the  government  identifies  the  user  accounts  it \nwants  to  monitor  and  sends  a  ‘selector’—a  specific \ncommunications facility, such as a target’s email address or \ntelephone number—to the relevant communications service \nprovider.  A  government  directive  then  compels  the \ncommunications service provider to give it communications \nsent to or from that selector (i.e., the government ‘tasks’ the \nselector).” (internal citations omitted)); Wikimedia Found. v. \nNSA, 143 F. Supp. 3d 344, 348–49 (D. Md. 2015) (“Under a \nsurveillance  program  called  ‘PRISM,’  U.S.-based  Internet \nService  Providers  furnish  the  NSA  with  electronic \ncommunications  that  contain  information  specified  by  the \nNSA.”). \n34 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 35      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nundermine  Schuchardt’s  ability  to  show  that  his  own \nelectronic  communications  were  seized  by  the  PRISM \nprogram. \nThe problem for the Government at this stage is that \nthe scope of materials that a court may consider in evaluating \na facial jurisdictional challenge raised in a motion under Rule \n12(b)(1) is not unconstrained. As with motions under Rule \n12(b)(6),  the  court  is  limited  to  the  four  corners  of  the \ncomplaint, “document[s] integral to or explicitly relied upon \nin the complaint,” and “any undisputedly authentic document \nthat a defendant attaches . . . if the plaintiff’s claims are based \non the document.” In re Asbestos Prods. Liability Litig. (No. \nVI), 822 F.3d 125, 133 & n.7 (3d Cir. 2016) (quoting In re \nBurlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d \nCir. 1997)). Schuchardt’s pleadings are in no way “based on” \nany countervailing authorities that support the Government’s \nposition,  nor  are  those  authorities  integral  to  or  explicitly \nrelied upon by his complaint—accordingly, we must ignore \ntheir persuasive value, whatever it may be, at this stage of the \nlitigation.  See  Gould  Elecs.,  220  F.3d  at  176.  Likewise, \ninsofar  as  the  Government’s  arguments  present  new \ninformation disagreeing with the factual premises underlying \nSchuchardt’s claims, we cannot consider them in this facial \njurisdictional challenge, the sole purpose of which is to test \nthe  legal  sufficiency  of  the  plaintiff’s  jurisdictional \naverments.  Instead,  disagreements  concerning  jurisdictional \nfacts should be presented in a factual challenge, at which time \nthe  court,  after  allowing  the  plaintiff  “to  respond  with \nevidence  supporting jurisdiction,”  may  fully  adjudicate the \nparties’ dispute, including the resolution of any questions of \nfact. Id. at 177.  \n35 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 36      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nV \nOur  decision  today  is  narrow:  we  hold  only  that \nSchuchardt’s second amended complaint pleaded his standing \nto sue for a violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be \nfree from unreasonable searches and seizures. This does not \nmean that he has standing to sue, as the Government remains \nfree upon remand to make a factual jurisdictional challenge to \nSchuchardt’s pleading. In anticipation of such a challenge, we \nprovide  the  following  guidance  to  the  District  Court  on \nremand. \nSchuchardt  has  suggested  that  he  is  entitled  to \njurisdictional discovery. See Transcript of Oral Argument at \n40–41, Schuchardt v. Obama, No. 15-3491 (3d Cir. May 17, \n2016).  We  leave  that  question  to  the  District  Court’s \ndiscretion with the caveat that “jurisdictional discovery is not \navailable  merely  because the plaintiff requests it.”  Lincoln \nBenefit Life Ins. Co. v. AEI Life, LLC, 800 F.3d 99, 108 n.38 \n(3d Cir. 2015). Jurisdictional discovery is not a license for the \nparties to engage in a “fishing expedition,” id., and that fact is \nparticularly  true  in  a  case  like  this  one,  which  involves \npotential issues of national security. In this very context, the \nSupreme Court has cautioned that jurisdictional discovery—\neven if conducted in camera—cannot be used to probe the \ninternal (and most likely classified) workings of the  national \nsecurity apparatus of the United States. See Clapper, 131 S. \nCt.  at  1149  n.4  (“[T]his  type  of  hypothetical  disclosure \nproceeding  would  allow  a  terrorist  (or  his  attorney)  to \ndetermine  whether  he  is  currently  under  U.S.  surveillance \nsimply  by  filing  a  lawsuit  challenging  the  Government’s \nsurveillance program.”). For that reason, the District Court \nshould take care to circumscribe the scope of discovery and \n36 \n \n\nCase: 15-3491     Document: 003112426786     Page: 37      Date Filed: 10/05/2016\nany ex parte and in camera procedures to only the factual \nquestions necessary to determine its jurisdiction.13  \nFinally, nothing in our opinion should be construed to \npreclude  the  Government  from  raising  any  applicable \nprivileges  barring  discovery—including  the  state  secrets \ndoctrine—or to suggest how the District Court should rule on \nany  privilege  the  Government  may  choose  to  assert.  See \nUnited States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1, 10 (1953). \n*  *  * \nFor  the  stated  reasons,  we  will  vacate  the  District \nCourt’s  order  dismissing  Schuchardt’s  second  amended \ncomplaint and remand for proceedings consistent with this \nopinion. \n                                                 \n13 For example, the linchpin of Schuchardt’s standing \nis his allegation that PRISM collects “all or substantially all \nof the e-mail sent by American citizens.” The District Court \nmay wish to consider what discovery is necessary for it to \nadjudicate  the  veracity  of  that  allegation  while  permitting \nSchuchardt an adequate evidentiary response. See also Jewel \nv. NSA, 2015 WL 545925, at *4 (N.D. Cal.
