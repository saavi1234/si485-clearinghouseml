Riles, a civil rights action, under 28 U.S.C. 1331 and 1343.\nThe Crawford parties, as members of the Larry P. class, made a\nmotion under Rule 60, Fed. R. Civ. P., and it was granted,\nthereby finally disposing of their claim. This Court has juris-\ndiction of the appeal from that final judgment under 28 U.S.C.\n1291. As for the Larry P. appellants, the district court's\n\n-2-\naction constituted the dissolution of an injunction, subject to\nimmediate appeal under 28 U.S.C. 1292(a)(1).\nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES\nThis case involves the uses and abuses of IQ testing for\npurposes of special education of black children. The United\nStates has substantial interest in these issues. The United\nStates has an interest in assuring that funds distributed under\nthe Education For All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, 20 U.S.C.\n1400, et seq. (now renamed the Individuals With Disabilities\nEducation Act) are administered in a manner consistent with the\nterms of the Act. The United States is also charged with the\nresponsibility of coordinating enforcement of Title VI of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, and Section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794. See Executive Order\n12250 (Nov. 2, 1980). Finally, the United States has enforcement\nresponsibilities under Title II of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 12131, et seq. The United\nStates participated as amicus curiae in the original Larry P.\nlitigation, both in the district court and in this Court,i\" and\nhas requested the district court for permission to resume its\nparticipation in the next phase of the case.\nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES PRESENTED\n1.

Whether the case is justiciable.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nThis matter was decided on summary judgment and is subject\nto de novo review by this Court.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n1. The original suit\nAs of 1969, the State of California recognized four state-\nreimbursable categories of special education. Two of the cate-\ngories assumed potential for average or above-average achievement\nin school, but that the children in question were either \"cultur-\nally disadvantaged\" or \"educationally handicapped.\" The latter\nterm encompassed emotional and neurological disturbances, and\nspecific learning disabilities such as dyslexia. The other two\ncategories assumed that the children could never master the\nnormal school curriculum because they were either profoundly\nretarded (Trainable Mentally Retarded (TMR)) or mildly retarded\n(Educable Mentally Retarded (EMR)). EMR classes were geared to\nbasic living skills, with reading and other academic disciplines\n\n- 4 -\ndeemphasized (Larry P. v. Riles, 495 F. Supp. 926, 937-939, 941-\n942 (N.D. Cal. 1979). As of 1970, state law prohibited placement\nin EMR of any child whose full-scale IQ score was 70 or above\n(id. at 948).Z/ On the other hand,- state law also mandated that\nplacement decisions be made on the basis of thorough, pro-\nfessional assessment of a child's developmental history and\nadaptive behavior as well as IQ score (ibid.).\nIn November 1971, suit was filed on behalf of six black\nelementary school children, representing \"all black San Francisco\nschool children who have been classified as mentally retarded on\nthe bases of I.Q. test results\" (Larry P. v. Riles, 343 F. Supp.\n1306, 1315 (N.D. Cal. 1972). The class defined, in the end, was\na statewide class of \"black children in California who have been\nThe most popular IQ tests, the Stanford-Binet and the\nWechsler tests (in this case, usually the Wechsler Intelligence\nScale for Children-revised, or WISC-R), are comprised of a large\nnumber of subtests which measure different facets of cognitive\nfunctioning such as picture assembly, memory, sequencing,\nvocabulary, general information, etc. Scores may be obtained for\neach subtest, for the verbal alone, for the performance side\nalone, or for the entire test (see 495 F. Supp. at 958). The raw\nscore on the full test can be converted into a score based on a\nnormal curve defining the norm as 100 and one standard deviation\nfrom the norm as 15. This is the \"full-scale score\" that is\npopularly known as IQ. Thus, an IQ of 70 represents two standard\ndeviations below the norm (495 F. Supp. at 952-954).\nThe history of IQ testing, which was proffered at trial to\nshow it was racially biased, was generally the history of the\nBinet test as developed at Stanford University by Professor Lewis\nTerman (id. at 935). The data cited by the district court\nshowing blacks to have a lower norm as a group were from the\nStanford-Binet and the WISC-R (id. at 954 & n.59). Although the\nevidence presented at trial was generally about these two tests,\nall the tests considered by the SDE to test \"intelligence\" ended\nup on the list of tests prohibited for EMR placement (see id. at\n931 n.3).\n\n-5-\nor in the future will be wrongly placed and maintained in special\nclasses for the 'educable mentally retarded' ('E.M.R.')\" (495 F.\nSupp. at 931).\nThe Larry P. plaintiffs began with two undisputed premises:\n(1) blacks as a group score one standard deviation below whites\non standardized IQ tests (id. at 934, 954); and (2) black\nchildren comprised  far greater proportion of EMR students than\ntheir proportion in the general school population (id. at 942-\n945). The plaintiffs sought to prove that, by defining EMR in\nterms of IQ test results, the State had knowingly and inten-\ntionally designed a system that would relegate a disproportionate\nnumber of black children to \"dead end\" classes, in violation of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment (id. at 942-951). In addition, they\nalleged that the practices in question violated the two federal\nstatutes, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Education\nFor All Handicapped Children Act, that require tests to be\nvalidated for the purposes for which they are used. Using\nunvalidated tests, they said, causes or risks causing children to\nbe perceived as handicapped (i.e., retarded) when they are not.\nSimilarly, they argued, such tests violate Title VI and/or its\nimplementing regulations, when, in addition to being unvalidated,\nthey have a racially disproportionate impact. See, generally,\n495 F. Supp. at 960-961).\nTrial was held from October 11, 1977, to March 15, 1978. A\nsubstantial portion of the trial was devoted to the debate\nregarding the built-in bias in IQ testing (495 F. Supp. at 953-\n\n- 6 -\n960). The district court found that the IQ tests in question\nwere in fact \"racially and culturally biased\" in the sense that\nthey have a disparate impact, i.e., that blacks as a group have a\nlower mean full-scale score than do whites as a group, and no one\nhas been able to give an adequate explanation why this should be\nso (id. at 955-957). Nor had anyone adequately shown that, for\nblacks, the full-scale IQ scores below 70 (but above the TMR\nlevel)V actually represent true, irremediable retardation (id.\nat 959-960). Accordingly, IQ scores constituted an \"unvalidated\"\nbasis for assigning black children to EMR classes (id. at 968-\n973). The district court found, as well, that -- state law\nnotwithstanding -- the school districts were placing black\nchildren in EMR classes in reliance entirely on IQ scores, rather\nthan on multidimensional assessments (id. at 948-950).\nThe district court entered judgment for the Larry P.\nplaintiffs with respect to all their constitutional and statutory\nclaims. The court enjoined the defendants \"from utilizing,\npermitting the use of, or approving the use of any standardized\nintelligence tests, including those now approved pursuant to Cal.\nAdmin. Code [section] 3401, for the identification of black\nE.M.R. children or their placement into E.M.R. classes, without\nsecuring prior approval by this court\" (495 F. Supp. at 989).\nNeither plaintiffs nor anyone else apparently disputes that\nIQ tests can detect, in both blacks and whites, true severe or\nprofound retardation, the type that the State called \"trainable\nmentally retarded\" (TMR). Blacks are not overrepresented among\nTMR students. Nor did anyone question the accuracy of full-scale\nIQ scores below 70 as defining retardation in white children,\nthough that remains an open question.\n\n-7-\n\"E.M.R.\" was defined as the category then created by the\nCalifornia Code \"or a substantially equivalent category,\" and the\nterm \"E.M.R. classes\" was defined to include the existing EMR\nclasses or any others to be created later to serve \"substantially\nthe same functions\" (ibid.). Thus, the decree anticipated that\nthere would be major changes in the near future in the special\neducation program and the categories it created.\n2. The appeal\nIn January 1984, this Court affirmed the district court's\njudgment on statutory grounds alone, not reaching the\nconstitutional issue. Defendant Riles, the State Superintendent\nand sole appellant, sought rehearing, and the court issued an\namended opinion upon the denial of rehearing on June 25, 1986.\nIn the amended opinion, the court of appeals affirmed the\ndistrict court's finding of statutory violations, but reversed\nthe finding of intentional discrimination, in violation of the\nFourteenth Amendment, by Wilson Riles (Larry P. v. Riles, 793\nF.2d 969, 984 (9th Cir. 1984).\n3. The second stage\nBy 1986, when the decision became final, California had --\nor claimed to have -- abolished EMR classes. It is not entirely\nclear what was happening between 1979 and 1986, except that the\nState apparently permitted the school districts to administer IQ\ntests to black children. Answers to interrogatories served by\nthe Larry P. plaintiffs revealed that the SDE had interpreted the\nLarry P. order, not to prohibit administration of IQ tests, but\n\n-8-\nto eliminate \"the placement and retention of children in\nisolated special day classes on the basis of only an IQ score\"\n(CR 159 at 11).i/ Whether there still were such classes or not,\nthe State instructed, when a black child scored in the \"EMR\nrange, other forms of assessment [should] be used to determine\nthe child's placement\" (ibid.). (In this context, placement\ndenotes, simply, the formulation of the child's Individualized\nEducational Plan (IEP)). Where test results were above the EMR\nrange, however, the directive presumably permitted psychologists\nto apply the same interpretive techniques with respect to black\nchildren as they would for white children.\nThe Larry P. plaintiffs believed that EMR classes had con-\ntinued in all but name (Br. 3). In fact, they were prepared to\nargue that the State's school districts had simply made it more\ndifficult to locate the children relegated to dead-end tracks.\nThus, the only way to prevent IQ testing \"for EMR\" was to prevent\nIQ testing for all special education. Second, they did not\nbelieve that there was any way to prevent reliance on IQ scores\nother than to ban administration of the tests. Moreover, they\nbelieved the original injunction had prohibited administration of\nIQ tests to black children, at least as long as there was any\nrisk that those children would end up identified as educable\n1\"\t\n\"CR \" refers to the docket entries in the district court\nclerk's record for Crawford v.

It\nfollowed that, from the Larry P. plaintiffs' point of view, the\nState was violating the original Larry P. injunction with its\ndirective permitting IQ tests to be administered to black\nchildren. Accordingly, on threat of moving for contempt, the\nLarry P. plaintiffs induced the SDE to enter into a stipulated\nrevision of the 1979 injunction.\nUnder the new injunction, entered September 25, 1986, and\nmodified on November 19, 1986, all school districts in the State\nwere ordered not to administer any \"intelligence\" test to any\nblack child referred for special education assessment, even if\nthe parents asked for it. If such testing was done privately or\nin another school system, the schools must send the protocols\nback and not place them in the child's file. See CR 159 at 5-6.\nThis injunction was embodied in SDE directives dated December 3,\n1986, and February 8, 1988 (Appendices A and B to Complaint, CR\n1)\nMeanwhile, in May 1987, a black school child in Fontana,\nCalifornia, was referred for testing as a possible candidate for\nspecial education. In the notification to his mother (Mrs.\nAmaya), there was a note saying that \"[blecause Demond [Crawfordl\nis Black, we will be unable to give him an intelligence test per\nPeckham decision\" (emphasis in the original) (Exhibit A to\nPlaintiffs' Supplemental Memorandum Regarding the Question of\nMootness, CR 59). This and several instances like it provoked\n\n- 10 -\nthe filing of the new action, originally in the Central District\nof California.\n4. The new suit: Crawford, et al. v. Honig\nOn May 10, 1988, suit was filed in the Central District of\nCalifornia on behalf of eight black school children, mostly from\nSan Bernardino and San Diego Counties, against the State Superin-\ntendent and the California State Board of Education (CV 88-02668\nAWT (Kx) (C.D. Cal.), incorporated in CR 1; see also CR 159 at\n5.) They alleged generally that each is or may be learning\ndisabled, neurologically impaired, or behaviorally or emotionally\ndisturbed. All had been referred for testing, but were notified\nthat they would not be permitted to take an intelligence test (CR\n1 (complaint) at 3-6, 9).\nThe complaint recognized that the prohibition in the\nDecember 3, 1986, directive was a product of the Larry P. case,\nbut the new plaintiffs apparently did not know about the\nSeptember 1986 order. They alleged that the Superintendent and\nBoard had issued directives that \"exceed[ed] the scope of the\nfederal courts' decision in Larry P. v. Riles\" (CR 1 (complaint,\npar. 32) at 10). Those directives, they alleged, denied the\nCrawford plaintiffs due process by enlarging the prohibition on\nIQ testing, in a manner that affected their interests, without a\nhearing (id. at 10-i1). In addition, they claimed, the direc-\ntives denied them (or their children) equal protection and rights\nunder Title VI by denying them access to the same tests available\nto white, Hispanic, Oriental, and other children (CR 1\n\n- 11 -\n(complaint) at 7, 10-14). The complaint also alleged that the\nprohibition violated 20 U.S.C. 1415(e)(4)(A) (of the Education\nFor All Handicapped Children Act) because it was \"racially and\nculturally discriminatory\" to refuse to let the plaintiffs take\nthe same tests as were available to all non-black children (CR 1\n(complaint) at 14-16).\nThe Crawford plaintiffs asked the court to enjoin the\nDecember 3, 1986 directive (CR 1 (complaint) at 20), to order the\ndefendants to administer appropriate intelligence tests to the\nplaintiff children (id. at 21-23), and to enjoin implementation\nof the directive to purge black children's records of IQ scores\n(ibid.) .\nThe suit was transferred to the Northern District of\nCalifornia on January 4, 1989, and assigned to Judge Peckham as a\n\"related case\" (CR 1 and 3). In March 1989, the Crawford\nplaintiffs moved to have the case consolidated with Larry P. (CR\n8, 9, and 13). On June 14, 1990, the district court denied the\nState defendants' motion to dismiss (CR 63 (teleconference); CR\n159 at 5-6). In July 1991, the district court granted the motion\nto consolidate the two cases and granted the Crawford plaintiffs'\nmotion for a preliminary injunction (CR 126; CR 159 at 7). On\nAugust 31, 1992, the district court entered summary judgment for\nthe Crawford plaintiffs and vacated the 1986 modification to the\nLarry P. injunction.-/\nThe court \"directed\" the SDE to rescind the directive that,\nin December 1986, implemented the 1986 injunction (docket no. 159\n(continued...)\n\n- 12 -\n5. The district court's 1992 opinion\nFirst, the court looked at its own 1979 findings of fact,\nand held that the \"1986 modification expanded the 1979 order\nbeyond the findings of the court\" (CR 159 at 7). The court\nreasoned that the original case concerned the use of IQ test\nscores in the context of EMR placement, and did not purport to\nlimit access to testing for learning disabilities (id. at 14-\n15). Indeed, the court expressed the view that the SDE direc-\ntives that went out between 1979 and 1986 -- indicating that it\nwas legitimate to administer IQ tests, but not to rely on the\nfull-scale score to place blacks in EMR -- was probably a fair\ninterpretation of the 1979 order, not contempt (id. at 19).\n\"Despite the Defendants' attempts to characterize the court's\n1979 order as a referendum on the discriminatory nature of IQ\ntesting,\" the court noted (id. at 23), \"this court's review of\nthe decision reveals that the decision was largely concerned with\nthe harm to African-American children resulting from improper\nplacement in dead-end educational programs.\"\nSecond, the district court reviewed the 1986 modification\n\"hearing.\" The court noted that the parties to that hearing\n(...continued)\nat 22). The actual injunction, however, does not contain that\nlanguage. As discussed below, we assume this permits the State\nto reinstitute its ban on IQ testing, either across the board or\nfor blacks only. The latter would, of course, open the State up\nto a renewed equal protection challenge. Meanwhile, the court\ndeclared the Crawford litigation at an end, and indicated that\nthe Crawford parties would have to seek to intervene in the\ndistrict court if they want to participate in the next round of\nhearings (id. at 24-25).\n\n- 13 -\n\"provided no evidence to support the conclusion that the\nsubstantial equivalent of EMR meant all special educational\nprograms\" (CR 159 at 20) (emphasis in the original). \"Nor was an\nattempt made to identify current 'dead end' programs substan-\ntially equivalent to the old EMR program\" (ibid.). This determi-\nnation would have to be made at some later date (id. at 22-23).\nThird, the court found that the Crawford plaintiffs were in\nfact part of the original Larry P. class. If tested, any child\nmight score below 70 and might be diagnosed as educable mentally\nretarded (CR 159 at 10). The interests of children who might\nscore above the EMR range were not prejudiced by the 1979 in-\njunction or by SDE's interpretation of it (ibid.); they could\ntake the test, but not be placed in EMR on the basis of the IQ\nscore alone (id. at 10-12). The order completely banning admini-\nstration of IQ tests to black children was merely an \"enforce-\nment\" or \"clarification\" of the 1979 order as applied to children\nwho, if tested, would score below 70; however, it also impinged\non the interests of those who would score above 70, and whose\nparents thought the test might be useful for diagnosis of\nlearning disabilities (id. at 12). No one, however, represented\nthe interest of potentially learning disabled black children\n(i.e., their interest in being tested) at the time of the 1986\nhearing and injunction. On the contrary, the order was entered\nby stipulation, \"crafted through private negotiation * * * and\nnot through extensive public discussion and debate\" (id. at 21).\nThis quasi-settlement incurred the \"same risks for compromise to\n\n- 14 -\nclass interests as are present in any class settlement or\nvoluntary dismissal under Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure,\" the court pointed out (ibid.).\nKs members of the Larry P. class, the court held, the\nCrawford plaintiffs could move under Rule 60(b)(4), Fed. R. Civ.\nP., to be relieved of the 1986 decree (CR 159 at 16-17). Once\nhaving made that motion, the court ruled, it was up to the court\nto decide whether they were barred by res judicata. The court\nconcluded that, because their particular subclass interests had\nnot been adequately represented in 1986, due process prevented\ntheir being bound by the 1986 judgment as members of the Larry P.\nclass (id. at 12-17), and they were free to make a collateral\nequal protection attack on the 1986 injunction. But due process\nrequired, in any event, that the 1986 injunction be vacated (id.\nat 21). Thus, the court declined to reach the equal protection\nissue raised by the Crawford plaintiffs (id. at 22, 26). The\ncourt (1) granted summary judgment for the Crawford plaintiffs on\ndue process grounds; and (2) ordered the 1986 injunction\nrescinded (id. at 26). In addition, the court noted that\n\"[b]ecause the EMR program is no longer operative, * * * further\naction is required to give meaning to the 1979 ruling in the\ncurrent educational system\" (id. at 23). The court also offered\nthe Larry P. plaintiffs an opportunity to show, at that hearing,\nthat IQ tests prejudiced the interests of all black children, not\n\n- 15 -\njust those whose full-scale IQ scores turned out to be below 70\n(id. at 22-24)./\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThe 1986 injunction entered in Larry P. had far-ranging\nimplications. Under that injunction, the school systems in\nCalifornia were prohibited from administering all tests denom-\ninated \"intelligence\" tests to African-American children. Thus,\nif a teacher referred a black child with learning problems for\nevaluation, the psychologists were absolutely barred from\nadministering such tests to that child.\nNeither the findings nor the injunction in the original\nLarry P. case justified the entry of the 1986 injunction without\na thorough \"fairness\" hearing and opportunity for all subclasses\nto be heard. The district court in Larry P. did not adjudicate\nthe usefulness to black children of IQ tests or subtests for all\npurposes. It found only that the full-scale IQ scores -- at\nleast on certain tests -- when they are below 70, cannot be\ncounted on to diagnose the sort of retardation that is compatible\nwith EMR placement as it then existed.\nAny injunction that exceeded the scope of that finding\nnecessarily impinged on the interests of children whose IQs would\nturn out to be above 70. Indeed, the 1986 injunction potentially\ndenied psychologists access to procedures that would be useful\nfor identifying the difficulties suffered by learning disabled\nThe United States has already asked the district court for\npermission to resume its participation as amicus curiae in these\nfurther hearings.\n\n- 16 -\nblack children. The district court did not, in all events,\npurport in 1992 to decide the merits of using the Stanford-Binet,\nWechsler, or other \"IQ\" tests to identify learning disabilities.\nIt decided only that the court's own 1986 order prohibiting their\nuse violated the due process rights of the Crawford plaintiffs,\nfor it impinged on their interests without their being heard.\nBy declaring the ban on all IQ testing to be beyond the\nscope of the Larry P. findings and injunction, the district court\nsimply opened this area for further voluntary state action and,\nperhaps, for later litigation. The court has not vacated its\n1979 injunction protecting African-American children from\nplacement in EMR classes on the basis of IQ scores. On the\ncontrary, the court has indicated it will hold further hearings\nto determine what constitutes the equivalent of EMR placement in\nthe California educational system of today. Requiring the\ndistrict court to reinstate the 1986 injunction, however, would\nclose down the inquiry permanently. Accordingly, this Court\nshould affirm.\nARGUMENT\nI\nTHE 1986 INJUNCTION EXCEEDED THE FINDINGS IN LARRY P.\nAppellants sought to justify the 1986 injunction by claiming\nthat it merely implemented the findings in the original Larry P.\ncase, and was necessitated by the State's disobedience to the\n1979 injunction. The district court held to the contrary. In so\ndoing, the district court merely construed its own 1979 opinion\n\n- 17 -\nand order. This required the resolution of no disputed facts and\ntherefore could be done in the context of a summary judgment\nmotion.\nThe district court's 1992 decision is faithful to its\noriginal findings and injunction. According to the district\ncourt, the central issue of Larry P. was always EMR classes --\ntheir isolation frcim the rest of the school population (495 F.\nSupp. at 979), the startlingly disproportionate number of black\nchildren who ended up in these classes (id. at 942-945, 951-955,\n979), and the stigma of being identified as retarded, especially\nin a society in which many people regarded black people as\nintellectually inferior (id. at 979).\nThe court correctly found that the EMR curriculum was\njustifiable only for children who have been properly diagnosed as\n\"retarded\" (495 F. Supp. at 937-942), and that EMR classes are so\ndesigned that they reduce the likelihood of a child's being able\nto move out and be exposed again to the normal curriculum (id. at\n942, 970). The court's findings about the history of IQ testing\nand its racist-xenophobic overtones support the finding that the\nlabel \"EMR\" and placement in special day classes is stigmatizing.\nThus, the use of isolated, dead-end EMR classes greatly exacer-\nbated the consequences of a misdiagnosis of retardation.\nSecond, the district court correctly reaffirmed that its\n1979 finding regarding the alleged bias of IQ tests was very\nlimited. Indeed, in 1979, the district court warned that (495 F.\nSupp. at 989) \"our decision * * * should not be construed as a\n\n- 18 -\nfinal judgment on the scientific validity of intelligence tests.\"\nThe court found in 1979 that the tests had disparate results and,\nin the context of EMR placement, adverse impact. Given the\ndisparate impact, the law requires that those responsible for\neducating children be sure the test is validated for the purpose\nfor which it is used. The court held in 1979 that \"the state has\nacted contrary to the law by requiring the use of tests that are\nracially and culturally discriminatory and have not been\nvalidated for labeling black E.M.R. children and placing them\ninto special classes for the mentally retarded\" (ibid.).1\nFurther, the court found as fact that, although the schools\nclaimed to rely on a multidimensional assessment for EMR\nplacement, a study showed this not to be the case, and, in fact,\nan IQ score below the cutoff generally destined children for EMR\nclasses (495 F. Supp. at 950).\nSo viewed, the findings in 1979 demanded only an injunction\nprohibiting reliance on IQ scores to identify children as edu-\ncable retarded. In particular,' the findings required prohibition\n2/ \nThe type of validity generally claimed for IQ tests is\ncriterion-related validity. This term refers only to statistical\ncorrelations between success on the test and success on the task\nto be performed, which in this case was the general school\ncurriculum. But the district court noted that prediction is not\nthe issue. Obviously, the children referred for testing have a\nrelatively poor educational prognosis absent the right kind of\nintervention. That is why they were referred for special\neducation in the first place. The issue is not \"prediction\" but,\nrather, the determination of what kind of intervention should be\nprescribed. The court decided that a test, even if a valid\npredictor of success or lack of it, could not be used as if it\nwere construct valid, that is, as if it actually diagnosed \"low\nintelligence.\" See 495 F. Supp. at 969.\n\n- 19 -\nof such reliance when the consequence was placement of black\nchildren in dead-end classes that were isolating and stigma-\ntizing. Under this interpretation, the injunction did not\npreclude the continued use of IQ tests to rule out retardation\n(especially to rule out severe retardation), or to identify\nspecific learning disabilities. This is the construction of the\ndistrict court opinion that the United States urged in this Court\nin 1981. It is also a fair description of what this Court held.\nSee, e.g., 793 F.2d at 979-980 (Rehabilitation Act and EHA), and\nat 981 (Title VI).\nAdmittedly, it was difficult to determine what constituted\ncompliance with the 1979 injunction. The 1986 injunction, more-\nover, assuredly prevented reliance on IQ scores -- by prohibiting\nIQ testing entirely. To that extent, the 1986 injunction was\nconsistent with the original findings. On the other hand, it\neliminated use of certain tests where their usefulness is at\nleast still open to debate.\nAppellants are incorrect in suggesting that the debate was\nconcluded in 1979. They mischaracterize the district court's\n1979 opinion by asserting that the district court found IQ tests\n\"cannot identify why a child is not learning nor assist in the\ndevelopment of an educational program for a child\" (Br. 7). At\nthe cited pages, the court actually said that an IQ score is\nsimply a statistical description of how the child performed -- on\nthat test -- relative to his or her age peers, and does not tell\n\n- 20 -\nus why that was the case (495 F. Supp. at 953, 973-974)../ It\nsaid nothing about the way in which IQ tests may (or may not)\nidentify specific learning disabilities. Contrary to the\nappellants' contention (Br. 7), the district court did not find\nassessments without IQ tests \"better tools\" than assessments that\nincluded such tests. What the court actually found was that\nusing alternative means of assessment for EMR had worked\n\"reasonably well\" (495 F. Supp. at 973), that alternative tests\n\"may be useful\" (id. at 973-974), and that, when denied the use\nof IQ testing, many psychologists went to more trouble to do the\nmultidimensional assessments they were supposed to do in the\nfirst place (ibid.). Moreover, the appellants ignore the dis-\ntrict court's disclaimer of having made a judgment as to the\nscientific worth of IQ tests for all purposes (id. at 989) and\nits 1992 disclaimer of having considered the usefulness of IQ\ntests to identify learning disabilities (CR 159 at 15). Thus,\nwhile the 1986 injunction was consistent with the original\nfindings, it went beyond it in a way that potentially prejudiced\nthe interests of many black children.\nFor example, a child could have a low score because he or\nshe had the flu, or was emotionally upset, or was exposed to a\ngreat deal of lead in early childhood; a low score, by\nhypothesis, tells us less than a high score.\n\n- 21 -\nII\nTHE DISTRICT COURT CORRECTLY HELD THAT THE 1986\nINJUNCTION WAS ENTERED WITHOUT ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION\nOF THE INTERESTS OF THE CRAWFORD PLAINTIFFS\nThe Larry P. class was certified under Rule 23(b)(2), Fed.\nR. Civ. P. This form of class certification does not offer\nanyone the opportunity to \"opt out.\" Actions prosecuted pursuant\nto this rule are therefore particularly vulnerable to being\ndirected by a single plaintiff (or a single attorney) genuinely\nconvinced of the justice of the cause he or she is pursuing.\nThis is why it is crucial that the representation of all members\nof the class be adequate at every stage of the proceedings. Rule\n23(a)(3) and (4), Fed. R. Civ. P.; Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32,\n40-43 (1940).\n\"Adequate representation as required by the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure Rule 23(a)(4) 'depends on the qualifications of\ncounsel for the representatives, an absence of antagonism, a\nsharing of interests between representatives and absentees, and\nthe unlikelihood that the suit is collusive'\" (Brown v. Ticor\nIns. Co., No. 91-15474 (9th Cir. Dec. 28, 1992) at 14813, quoting\nIn re N. Dist. of Cal. Dalkon Shield IUD Prods. Liab. Litig., 693\nF.2d 847, 855 (9th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1171\n(1983). In the present case, there was surely a potential\nantagonism among members of the class which the representatives\ndid not acknowledge and, indeed, continue to deny. It is crucial\nin such cases that no relief be entered by agreement or stipula-\ntion without the kind of hearing that allows for the active\n\n- 22 -\npresence of those class members who have interests that may\nconflict with those of the class representative (Rule 23(e), Fed.\nR. Civ. P.; Simer v. Rios, 661 F.2d 655, 664-665 (7th Cir. 1981),\ncert. denied, 456 U.S. 917 (1982)).- No such hearing was held in\nthis case. Thus, as the district court pointed out (CR 159 at\n13), the fact that some plaintiffs will later be able to\n\"extricate themselves from class action judgments if subsequent\ncourts find them to [have been] inadequately represented is\nintegral to the constitutionality of the class action procedure'\n[citation omitted].\"\nIt is clear that the Crawford plaintiffs are members of the\nLarry P. class, though the district court's ultimate definition\nof the Larry P. class was awkward. Pursuant to Rule 23(c)(3),\nthe court described in the judgment those whom the court found to\nbe members of the class (emphasis added): \"black children in\nCalifornia who have been or in the future will be wrongly placed\nand maintained in special classes for the 'educable mentally\nretarded\" (495 F. Supp. at 931). Although the term \"IQ tests\"\ndoes not appear, we know from the later context that to be\n\"wrongly placed\" is to be placed simply on the basis of an IQ\nfull-scale score.\nThe court's class description cannot be taken literally. A\nclass of persons protected cannot be the people who \"will be\"\nwronged. One way to read the class definition is that it\nincludes only those black children who have been or will in the\nfuture be tested and will receive a full-scale score of less than\n\n- 23 -\n70 on an IQ test. Such children, then, are protected by the\nLarry P. injunction from being placed in EMR classes (or\nidentified as EMR for substantially equivalent purposes) on the\nbasis, alone, of that score. If this is the correct description\nof the class, then the Crawford plaintiffs are not members of the\nclass (or were not, when they were refused IQ tests). Indeed, in\norder to be a member of the protected class, one must be black,\nand take an IQ test, and score below 70. If these plaintiffs are\nnot members of the class, there is no res judicata problem. The\nLarry P. judgment does not bind them and they were free to bring\ntheir equal protection case for being denied the opportunity to\ntake tests that are available to white children.\nIt might have been simpler if the district court had decided\nto analyze the res judicata issue this way in 1992. But it was\nnot the way that the district court chose, perhaps because the\ncourt did not wish, at this stage, to entertain the equal pro-\ntection issue. In all events, it was legitimate for the district\ncourt to characterize the class' it certified in Larry P. as \"all\nblack children in the school systems of California, including but\nnot limited to all black children who have been given IQ tests.\"\nThe 1979 injunction protected this class from being \"wrongly\nidentified and placed.\" The emphasis is not on test admini-\nstration, but on identification and placement. If identification\nof a child as EMR, and his or her placement in an EMR class (or\nits substantial equivalent) is not based upon a score, then the\nchild has not been \"wrongly identified\" or \"wrongly placed.\"\n\n- 24 -\nThe Crawford plaintiffs, as members of the Larry P. class, were\nprotected by the 1979 injunction from wrongful placement in EMR\nclasses in reliance on IQ scores. See Sam Fox Publishing Co. v.\nUnited States, 366 U.S. 683, 692-693 (1961) (plaintiffs were\nbound by prior class action to the extent, and only to the\nextent, that they were adequately represented there). Of course,\nthey were also protected from such wrongful placement by the 1986\ninjunction. But the latter injunction also blocked their access\nto tests they believed would be useful to identification, if not\ndiagnosis, of their specific learning problems.V\nIn the present phase of the case, the district court found\nthat no one had represented the interests of those members of the\nbroad Larry P. class (all black children in the State's public\nschools) who believed IQ testing to be useful for some, if not\nall, purposes. The court could equally well have found in 1992\nthat the 1986 injunction, entered as it was by stipulation, was\nentered without adequate notice to the broader class. Whether\nreasoning from Rule 23(a)(3) and (4) or Rule 23(e), the district\ncourt was correct in finding entry of the 1986 injunction to have\nviolated the due process rights of the Crawford plaintiffs.\nAppellants (including the State, apparently), in supporting\nthe 1986 injunction, continue to maintain that the State cannot\nbe trusted not to make placements in reliance on IQ scores, if\n2/ When the district court held that the IQ tests were not\n\"diagnostic,\" it meant only that they did not \"diagnose\" within\nthe medical model -- and specifically, did not diagnose a\nphysical condition known as retardation. See Br. 7.\n\n- 25 -\npsychologists and educators are allowed to obtain that inform-\nation at all. Accordingly, even if the Larry P. injunction only\nprotects children from improper EMR placements, they would prefer\nthat all tests be suspended until the district court finishes\nadjudicating the question of what constitutes the \"substantial\nequivalent\" of EMR classes (see Br. 21). In short, they would\nlike the 1986 injunction reinstated to serve in the nature of\npreliminary relief pending completion of the \"substantial\nequivalency\" hearing.\nThe Larry P. plaintiffs may be right that any use leads to\nreliance, and that the danger is great particularly if the\ncurrent system of special education is no improvement on the\nprevious one (see Br. 18). We do not read the district court's\nmost recent decision to reject the appellants' view entirely.\nAll the court has decided is that the subclass of people who\nbelieve their children might benefit from IQ testing were not\ngiven an opportunity to be heard when the court and the parties\njumped to the conclusion that a' total ban was the only way to\nprevent misuse of the tests. This denial of due process weighs\nheavily against the reinstitution of the 1986 injunction before,\nrather than after, the \"substantial equivalence\" issue is\nresolved.\nSignificantly, the district court, in 1992, made no finding\nthat the WISC-R tests or their Stanford-Binet equivalents are in\nfact useful to the identification of specific learning disabil-\nities. The district court has not written off the possibility\n\n- 26 -\nthat the original plaintiffs may yet introduce new or additional\nevidence showing that IQ tests necessarily distort the identi-\nfication of learning disabilities in black children, and that\nthis has an \"adverse\" effect as serious as the effect of\nmisplacement in EMR classes. When the district court takes up\nthe question of the present status of EMR classes (the\nsubstantial equivalence issue), it will undoubtedly hear more\nabout what effect IQ testing may have on black children.\nNor has the court ordered the resumption of IQ testing for\nanyone, black or white, pending further action by the court. See\nBr. 41-42. The court has simply declared that (1) the 1979 order\ndid not forbid use of those tests for the purposes proposed by\nthe Crawford plaintiffs; (2) the court would not now forbid it on\nthe basis, alone, of its own findings in Larry P.; and (3) had\nthe court been aware of who was affected and how they were\naffected, it would never have entered the 1986 order at all. The\neffect of lifting the 1986 injunction is temporarily to give the\nState the entire responsibility for deciding whether to admin-\nister (or refuse to administer) IQ tests to black children, and\nto risk being faced with an equal protection claim if they refuse\nto do so on the basis of race.\nIII\nTHE CASE IS JUSTICIABLE\nAppellants devote large portions of their brief to arguing\nthat the Crawford plaintiffs presented no justiciable issue, and\nthat the district court held to the contrary without making the\n\n- 27 -\nnecessary subordinate findings (Br. 23-38). One branch of this\nargument is that the Crawford plaintiffs were in fact given the\nforbidden IQ tests, and therefore have no redressable grievance\n(Br. 23-33). The second branch of this contention is that --\nwith or without IQ tests -- the Crawford plaintiffs have been\nassigned to the proper form of special education, and therefore\nthey have no remediable grievance.\nAs amicus, we do not address these issues in detail. It\nwould appear that there are four plaintiff children still in the\ncase: Demond Crawford, Barbara Florence, James Florence, and\nTerence Pina (see dismissals at CR 75). Each of these children\nwas tested for special education during the 1980s, but with one\nexception, they were not given the tests that were on the\n\"forbidden\" list. See Declaration of Devena Reed, CR 52, at 9,\n11, 17, 22. The only one . to receive a WISC-R was James Florence,\nand that was in April 1986, prior to the September 1986\ninjunction. James Florence, moreover, is still of school age\n(see attachment to CR 52 showing Florence to have been born in\n1977) and presumably will need to be retested during his school\ncareer, especially since he is in a special day class (Br. 26).\nMoreover, it is clear that the district court would have\ncertified the subclass had the court not been able to end the\ncase on due process grounds immediately. 10(cid:9)Thus, he is one\n10(cid:9)\nThe district court, when it denied subclass certification,\ncertainly was not influenced by the small number of named\nplaintiffs. Numerosity has nothing to do with it (Br. 40-41).\nThere is no rule that class representatives must be numerous --\nonly that they represent a class too numerous for ordinary joinder.\n\n- 28 -\nplaintiff who apparently had standing when he sued, and as to\nwhom the case is not moot, which the appellants concede (Br. 26,\n31).\nThe argument that no educational harm was shown misses the\npoint. The plaintiffs' standing was based on a claim of having\nsuffered a constitutional injury, i.e., being denied an IQ test\nsolely because of an order that was entered without their being\nheard. 11 A merits question remains to be decided: assuming\nblack children cannot be placed in EMR on the basis of IQ scores,\nis it protective to deny them IQ testing, or is it a deprivation?\nThis merits question has never been decided. Appellants, by\nstating what they believe to be the answer (Br. 27-31), are again\ntaking as decided that which they thought should have been\nsettled in Larry P. but which clearly was not.\n111(cid:9)\nBecause plaintiffs presented a constitutional question,\nthey clearly did not have to exhaust administrative remedies\nassociated with the Education For All Handicapped Children Act.\nIn addition, the form their action took was a Rule 60(b) motion.\nIf one is already a party to a suit and wishes to make a post-\njudgment motion, there are no administrative remedies to exhaust.\n\n- 29 -\nCONCLUSION\nThe judgment below should be affirmed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJAMES P.

Riles, a civil rights action, under 28 U.S.C. 1331 and 1343.\nThe Crawford parties, as members of the Larry P. class, made a\nmotion under Rule 60, Fed. R. Civ. P., and it was granted,\nthereby finally disposing of their claim. This Court has juris-\ndiction of the appeal from that final judgment under 28 U.S.C.\n1291. As for the Larry P. appellants, the district court's\n\n-2-\naction constituted the dissolution of an injunction, subject to\nimmediate appeal under 28 U.S.C. 1292(a)(1).\nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES\nThis case involves the uses and abuses of IQ testing for\npurposes of special education of black children. The United\nStates has substantial interest in these issues. The United\nStates has an interest in assuring that funds distributed under\nthe Education For All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, 20 U.S.C.\n1400, et seq. (now renamed the Individuals With Disabilities\nEducation Act) are administered in a manner consistent with the\nterms of the Act. The United States is also charged with the\nresponsibility of coordinating enforcement of Title VI of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, and Section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794. See Executive Order\n12250 (Nov. 2, 1980). Finally, the United States has enforcement\nresponsibilities under Title II of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 12131, et seq. The United\nStates participated as amicus curiae in the original Larry P.\nlitigation, both in the district court and in this Court,i\" and\nhas requested the district court for permission to resume its\nparticipation in the next phase of the case.\nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES PRESENTED\n1.

Whether the case is justiciable.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nThis matter was decided on summary judgment and is subject\nto de novo review by this Court.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n1. The original suit\nAs of 1969, the State of California recognized four state-\nreimbursable categories of special education. Two of the cate-\ngories assumed potential for average or above-average achievement\nin school, but that the children in question were either \"cultur-\nally disadvantaged\" or \"educationally handicapped.\" The latter\nterm encompassed emotional and neurological disturbances, and\nspecific learning disabilities such as dyslexia. The other two\ncategories assumed that the children could never master the\nnormal school curriculum because they were either profoundly\nretarded (Trainable Mentally Retarded (TMR)) or mildly retarded\n(Educable Mentally Retarded (EMR)). EMR classes were geared to\nbasic living skills, with reading and other academic disciplines\n\n- 4 -\ndeemphasized (Larry P. v. Riles, 495 F. Supp. 926, 937-939, 941-\n942 (N.D. Cal. 1979). As of 1970, state law prohibited placement\nin EMR of any child whose full-scale IQ score was 70 or above\n(id. at 948).Z/ On the other hand,- state law also mandated that\nplacement decisions be made on the basis of thorough, pro-\nfessional assessment of a child's developmental history and\nadaptive behavior as well as IQ score (ibid.).\nIn November 1971, suit was filed on behalf of six black\nelementary school children, representing \"all black San Francisco\nschool children who have been classified as mentally retarded on\nthe bases of I.Q. test results\" (Larry P. v. Riles, 343 F. Supp.\n1306, 1315 (N.D. Cal. 1972). The class defined, in the end, was\na statewide class of \"black children in California who have been\nThe most popular IQ tests, the Stanford-Binet and the\nWechsler tests (in this case, usually the Wechsler Intelligence\nScale for Children-revised, or WISC-R), are comprised of a large\nnumber of subtests which measure different facets of cognitive\nfunctioning such as picture assembly, memory, sequencing,\nvocabulary, general information, etc. Scores may be obtained for\neach subtest, for the verbal alone, for the performance side\nalone, or for the entire test (see 495 F. Supp. at 958). The raw\nscore on the full test can be converted into a score based on a\nnormal curve defining the norm as 100 and one standard deviation\nfrom the norm as 15. This is the \"full-scale score\" that is\npopularly known as IQ. Thus, an IQ of 70 represents two standard\ndeviations below the norm (495 F. Supp. at 952-954).\nThe history of IQ testing, which was proffered at trial to\nshow it was racially biased, was generally the history of the\nBinet test as developed at Stanford University by Professor Lewis\nTerman (id. at 935). The data cited by the district court\nshowing blacks to have a lower norm as a group were from the\nStanford-Binet and the WISC-R (id. at 954 & n.59). Although the\nevidence presented at trial was generally about these two tests,\nall the tests considered by the SDE to test \"intelligence\" ended\nup on the list of tests prohibited for EMR placement (see id. at\n931 n.3).\n\n-5-\nor in the future will be wrongly placed and maintained in special\nclasses for the 'educable mentally retarded' ('E.M.R.')\" (495 F.\nSupp. at 931).\nThe Larry P. plaintiffs began with two undisputed premises:\n(1) blacks as a group score one standard deviation below whites\non standardized IQ tests (id. at 934, 954); and (2) black\nchildren comprised  far greater proportion of EMR students than\ntheir proportion in the general school population (id. at 942-\n945). The plaintiffs sought to prove that, by defining EMR in\nterms of IQ test results, the State had knowingly and inten-\ntionally designed a system that would relegate a disproportionate\nnumber of black children to \"dead end\" classes, in violation of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment (id. at 942-951). In addition, they\nalleged that the practices in question violated the two federal\nstatutes, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Education\nFor All Handicapped Children Act, that require tests to be\nvalidated for the purposes for which they are used. Using\nunvalidated tests, they said, causes or risks causing children to\nbe perceived as handicapped (i.e., retarded) when they are not.\nSimilarly, they argued, such tests violate Title VI and/or its\nimplementing regulations, when, in addition to being unvalidated,\nthey have a racially disproportionate impact. See, generally,\n495 F. Supp. at 960-961).\nTrial was held from October 11, 1977, to March 15, 1978. A\nsubstantial portion of the trial was devoted to the debate\nregarding the built-in bias in IQ testing (495 F. Supp. at 953-\n\n- 6 -\n960). The district court found that the IQ tests in question\nwere in fact \"racially and culturally biased\" in the sense that\nthey have a disparate impact, i.e., that blacks as a group have a\nlower mean full-scale score than do whites as a group, and no one\nhas been able to give an adequate explanation why this should be\nso (id. at 955-957). Nor had anyone adequately shown that, for\nblacks, the full-scale IQ scores below 70 (but above the TMR\nlevel)V actually represent true, irremediable retardation (id.\nat 959-960). Accordingly, IQ scores constituted an \"unvalidated\"\nbasis for assigning black children to EMR classes (id. at 968-\n973). The district court found, as well, that -- state law\nnotwithstanding -- the school districts were placing black\nchildren in EMR classes in reliance entirely on IQ scores, rather\nthan on multidimensional assessments (id. at 948-950).\nThe district court entered judgment for the Larry P.\nplaintiffs with respect to all their constitutional and statutory\nclaims. The court enjoined the defendants \"from utilizing,\npermitting the use of, or approving the use of any standardized\nintelligence tests, including those now approved pursuant to Cal.\nAdmin. Code [section] 3401, for the identification of black\nE.M.R. children or their placement into E.M.R. classes, without\nsecuring prior approval by this court\" (495 F. Supp. at 989).\nNeither plaintiffs nor anyone else apparently disputes that\nIQ tests can detect, in both blacks and whites, true severe or\nprofound retardation, the type that the State called \"trainable\nmentally retarded\" (TMR). Blacks are not overrepresented among\nTMR students. Nor did anyone question the accuracy of full-scale\nIQ scores below 70 as defining retardation in white children,\nthough that remains an open question.\n\n-7-\n\"E.M.R.\" was defined as the category then created by the\nCalifornia Code \"or a substantially equivalent category,\" and the\nterm \"E.M.R. classes\" was defined to include the existing EMR\nclasses or any others to be created later to serve \"substantially\nthe same functions\" (ibid.). Thus, the decree anticipated that\nthere would be major changes in the near future in the special\neducation program and the categories it created.\n2. The appeal\nIn January 1984, this Court affirmed the district court's\njudgment on statutory grounds alone, not reaching the\nconstitutional issue. Defendant Riles, the State Superintendent\nand sole appellant, sought rehearing, and the court issued an\namended opinion upon the denial of rehearing on June 25, 1986.\nIn the amended opinion, the court of appeals affirmed the\ndistrict court's finding of statutory violations, but reversed\nthe finding of intentional discrimination, in violation of the\nFourteenth Amendment, by Wilson Riles (Larry P. v. Riles, 793\nF.2d 969, 984 (9th Cir. 1984).\n3. The second stage\nBy 1986, when the decision became final, California had --\nor claimed to have -- abolished EMR classes. It is not entirely\nclear what was happening between 1979 and 1986, except that the\nState apparently permitted the school districts to administer IQ\ntests to black children. Answers to interrogatories served by\nthe Larry P. plaintiffs revealed that the SDE had interpreted the\nLarry P. order, not to prohibit administration of IQ tests, but\n\n-8-\nto eliminate \"the placement and retention of children in\nisolated special day classes on the basis of only an IQ score\"\n(CR 159 at 11).i/ Whether there still were such classes or not,\nthe State instructed, when a black child scored in the \"EMR\nrange, other forms of assessment [should] be used to determine\nthe child's placement\" (ibid.). (In this context, placement\ndenotes, simply, the formulation of the child's Individualized\nEducational Plan (IEP)). Where test results were above the EMR\nrange, however, the directive presumably permitted psychologists\nto apply the same interpretive techniques with respect to black\nchildren as they would for white children.\nThe Larry P. plaintiffs believed that EMR classes had con-\ntinued in all but name (Br. 3). In fact, they were prepared to\nargue that the State's school districts had simply made it more\ndifficult to locate the children relegated to dead-end tracks.\nThus, the only way to prevent IQ testing \"for EMR\" was to prevent\nIQ testing for all special education. Second, they did not\nbelieve that there was any way to prevent reliance on IQ scores\nother than to ban administration of the tests. Moreover, they\nbelieved the original injunction had prohibited administration of\nIQ tests to black children, at least as long as there was any\nrisk that those children would end up identified as educable\n1\"\t\n\"CR \" refers to the docket entries in the district court\nclerk's record for Crawford v.

It\nfollowed that, from the Larry P. plaintiffs' point of view, the\nState was violating the original Larry P. injunction with its\ndirective permitting IQ tests to be administered to black\nchildren. Accordingly, on threat of moving for contempt, the\nLarry P. plaintiffs induced the SDE to enter into a stipulated\nrevision of the 1979 injunction.\nUnder the new injunction, entered September 25, 1986, and\nmodified on November 19, 1986, all school districts in the State\nwere ordered not to administer any \"intelligence\" test to any\nblack child referred for special education assessment, even if\nthe parents asked for it. If such testing was done privately or\nin another school system, the schools must send the protocols\nback and not place them in the child's file. See CR 159 at 5-6.\nThis injunction was embodied in SDE directives dated December 3,\n1986, and February 8, 1988 (Appendices A and B to Complaint, CR\n1)\nMeanwhile, in May 1987, a black school child in Fontana,\nCalifornia, was referred for testing as a possible candidate for\nspecial education. In the notification to his mother (Mrs.\nAmaya), there was a note saying that \"[blecause Demond [Crawfordl\nis Black, we will be unable to give him an intelligence test per\nPeckham decision\" (emphasis in the original) (Exhibit A to\nPlaintiffs' Supplemental Memorandum Regarding the Question of\nMootness, CR 59). This and several instances like it provoked\n\n- 10 -\nthe filing of the new action, originally in the Central District\nof California.\n4. The new suit: Crawford, et al. v. Honig\nOn May 10, 1988, suit was filed in the Central District of\nCalifornia on behalf of eight black school children, mostly from\nSan Bernardino and San Diego Counties, against the State Superin-\ntendent and the California State Board of Education (CV 88-02668\nAWT (Kx) (C.D. Cal.), incorporated in CR 1; see also CR 159 at\n5.) They alleged generally that each is or may be learning\ndisabled, neurologically impaired, or behaviorally or emotionally\ndisturbed. All had been referred for testing, but were notified\nthat they would not be permitted to take an intelligence test (CR\n1 (complaint) at 3-6, 9).\nThe complaint recognized that the prohibition in the\nDecember 3, 1986, directive was a product of the Larry P. case,\nbut the new plaintiffs apparently did not know about the\nSeptember 1986 order. They alleged that the Superintendent and\nBoard had issued directives that \"exceed[ed] the scope of the\nfederal courts' decision in Larry P. v. Riles\" (CR 1 (complaint,\npar. 32) at 10). Those directives, they alleged, denied the\nCrawford plaintiffs due process by enlarging the prohibition on\nIQ testing, in a manner that affected their interests, without a\nhearing (id. at 10-i1). In addition, they claimed, the direc-\ntives denied them (or their children) equal protection and rights\nunder Title VI by denying them access to the same tests available\nto white, Hispanic, Oriental, and other children (CR 1\n\n- 11 -\n(complaint) at 7, 10-14). The complaint also alleged that the\nprohibition violated 20 U.S.C. 1415(e)(4)(A) (of the Education\nFor All Handicapped Children Act) because it was \"racially and\nculturally discriminatory\" to refuse to let the plaintiffs take\nthe same tests as were available to all non-black children (CR 1\n(complaint) at 14-16).\nThe Crawford plaintiffs asked the court to enjoin the\nDecember 3, 1986 directive (CR 1 (complaint) at 20), to order the\ndefendants to administer appropriate intelligence tests to the\nplaintiff children (id. at 21-23), and to enjoin implementation\nof the directive to purge black children's records of IQ scores\n(ibid.) .\nThe suit was transferred to the Northern District of\nCalifornia on January 4, 1989, and assigned to Judge Peckham as a\n\"related case\" (CR 1 and 3). In March 1989, the Crawford\nplaintiffs moved to have the case consolidated with Larry P. (CR\n8, 9, and 13). On June 14, 1990, the district court denied the\nState defendants' motion to dismiss (CR 63 (teleconference); CR\n159 at 5-6). In July 1991, the district court granted the motion\nto consolidate the two cases and granted the Crawford plaintiffs'\nmotion for a preliminary injunction (CR 126; CR 159 at 7). On\nAugust 31, 1992, the district court entered summary judgment for\nthe Crawford plaintiffs and vacated the 1986 modification to the\nLarry P. injunction.-/\nThe court \"directed\" the SDE to rescind the directive that,\nin December 1986, implemented the 1986 injunction (docket no. 159\n(continued...)\n\n- 12 -\n5. The district court's 1992 opinion\nFirst, the court looked at its own 1979 findings of fact,\nand held that the \"1986 modification expanded the 1979 order\nbeyond the findings of the court\" (CR 159 at 7). The court\nreasoned that the original case concerned the use of IQ test\nscores in the context of EMR placement, and did not purport to\nlimit access to testing for learning disabilities (id. at 14-\n15). Indeed, the court expressed the view that the SDE direc-\ntives that went out between 1979 and 1986 -- indicating that it\nwas legitimate to administer IQ tests, but not to rely on the\nfull-scale score to place blacks in EMR -- was probably a fair\ninterpretation of the 1979 order, not contempt (id. at 19).\n\"Despite the Defendants' attempts to characterize the court's\n1979 order as a referendum on the discriminatory nature of IQ\ntesting,\" the court noted (id. at 23), \"this court's review of\nthe decision reveals that the decision was largely concerned with\nthe harm to African-American children resulting from improper\nplacement in dead-end educational programs.\"\nSecond, the district court reviewed the 1986 modification\n\"hearing.\" The court noted that the parties to that hearing\n(...continued)\nat 22). The actual injunction, however, does not contain that\nlanguage. As discussed below, we assume this permits the State\nto reinstitute its ban on IQ testing, either across the board or\nfor blacks only. The latter would, of course, open the State up\nto a renewed equal protection challenge. Meanwhile, the court\ndeclared the Crawford litigation at an end, and indicated that\nthe Crawford parties would have to seek to intervene in the\ndistrict court if they want to participate in the next round of\nhearings (id. at 24-25).\n\n- 13 -\n\"provided no evidence to support the conclusion that the\nsubstantial equivalent of EMR meant all special educational\nprograms\" (CR 159 at 20) (emphasis in the original). \"Nor was an\nattempt made to identify current 'dead end' programs substan-\ntially equivalent to the old EMR program\" (ibid.). This determi-\nnation would have to be made at some later date (id. at 22-23).\nThird, the court found that the Crawford plaintiffs were in\nfact part of the original Larry P. class. If tested, any child\nmight score below 70 and might be diagnosed as educable mentally\nretarded (CR 159 at 10). The interests of children who might\nscore above the EMR range were not prejudiced by the 1979 in-\njunction or by SDE's interpretation of it (ibid.); they could\ntake the test, but not be placed in EMR on the basis of the IQ\nscore alone (id. at 10-12). The order completely banning admini-\nstration of IQ tests to black children was merely an \"enforce-\nment\" or \"clarification\" of the 1979 order as applied to children\nwho, if tested, would score below 70; however, it also impinged\non the interests of those who would score above 70, and whose\nparents thought the test might be useful for diagnosis of\nlearning disabilities (id. at 12). No one, however, represented\nthe interest of potentially learning disabled black children\n(i.e., their interest in being tested) at the time of the 1986\nhearing and injunction. On the contrary, the order was entered\nby stipulation, \"crafted through private negotiation * * * and\nnot through extensive public discussion and debate\" (id. at 21).\nThis quasi-settlement incurred the \"same risks for compromise to\n\n- 14 -\nclass interests as are present in any class settlement or\nvoluntary dismissal under Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure,\" the court pointed out (ibid.).\nKs members of the Larry P. class, the court held, the\nCrawford plaintiffs could move under Rule 60(b)(4), Fed. R. Civ.\nP., to be relieved of the 1986 decree (CR 159 at 16-17). Once\nhaving made that motion, the court ruled, it was up to the court\nto decide whether they were barred by res judicata. The court\nconcluded that, because their particular subclass interests had\nnot been adequately represented in 1986, due process prevented\ntheir being bound by the 1986 judgment as members of the Larry P.\nclass (id. at 12-17), and they were free to make a collateral\nequal protection attack on the 1986 injunction. But due process\nrequired, in any event, that the 1986 injunction be vacated (id.\nat 21). Thus, the court declined to reach the equal protection\nissue raised by the Crawford plaintiffs (id. at 22, 26). The\ncourt (1) granted summary judgment for the Crawford plaintiffs on\ndue process grounds; and (2) ordered the 1986 injunction\nrescinded (id. at 26). In addition, the court noted that\n\"[b]ecause the EMR program is no longer operative, * * * further\naction is required to give meaning to the 1979 ruling in the\ncurrent educational system\" (id. at 23). The court also offered\nthe Larry P. plaintiffs an opportunity to show, at that hearing,\nthat IQ tests prejudiced the interests of all black children, not\n\n- 15 -\njust those whose full-scale IQ scores turned out to be below 70\n(id. at 22-24)./\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThe 1986 injunction entered in Larry P. had far-ranging\nimplications. Under that injunction, the school systems in\nCalifornia were prohibited from administering all tests denom-\ninated \"intelligence\" tests to African-American children. Thus,\nif a teacher referred a black child with learning problems for\nevaluation, the psychologists were absolutely barred from\nadministering such tests to that child.\nNeither the findings nor the injunction in the original\nLarry P. case justified the entry of the 1986 injunction without\na thorough \"fairness\" hearing and opportunity for all subclasses\nto be heard. The district court in Larry P. did not adjudicate\nthe usefulness to black children of IQ tests or subtests for all\npurposes. It found only that the full-scale IQ scores -- at\nleast on certain tests -- when they are below 70, cannot be\ncounted on to diagnose the sort of retardation that is compatible\nwith EMR placement as it then existed.\nAny injunction that exceeded the scope of that finding\nnecessarily impinged on the interests of children whose IQs would\nturn out to be above 70. Indeed, the 1986 injunction potentially\ndenied psychologists access to procedures that would be useful\nfor identifying the difficulties suffered by learning disabled\nThe United States has already asked the district court for\npermission to resume its participation as amicus curiae in these\nfurther hearings.\n\n- 16 -\nblack children. The district court did not, in all events,\npurport in 1992 to decide the merits of using the Stanford-Binet,\nWechsler, or other \"IQ\" tests to identify learning disabilities.\nIt decided only that the court's own 1986 order prohibiting their\nuse violated the due process rights of the Crawford plaintiffs,\nfor it impinged on their interests without their being heard.\nBy declaring the ban on all IQ testing to be beyond the\nscope of the Larry P. findings and injunction, the district court\nsimply opened this area for further voluntary state action and,\nperhaps, for later litigation. The court has not vacated its\n1979 injunction protecting African-American children from\nplacement in EMR classes on the basis of IQ scores. On the\ncontrary, the court has indicated it will hold further hearings\nto determine what constitutes the equivalent of EMR placement in\nthe California educational system of today. Requiring the\ndistrict court to reinstate the 1986 injunction, however, would\nclose down the inquiry permanently. Accordingly, this Court\nshould affirm.\nARGUMENT\nI\nTHE 1986 INJUNCTION EXCEEDED THE FINDINGS IN LARRY P.\nAppellants sought to justify the 1986 injunction by claiming\nthat it merely implemented the findings in the original Larry P.\ncase, and was necessitated by the State's disobedience to the\n1979 injunction. The district court held to the contrary. In so\ndoing, the district court merely construed its own 1979 opinion\n\n- 17 -\nand order. This required the resolution of no disputed facts and\ntherefore could be done in the context of a summary judgment\nmotion.\nThe district court's 1992 decision is faithful to its\noriginal findings and injunction. According to the district\ncourt, the central issue of Larry P. was always EMR classes --\ntheir isolation frcim the rest of the school population (495 F.\nSupp. at 979), the startlingly disproportionate number of black\nchildren who ended up in these classes (id. at 942-945, 951-955,\n979), and the stigma of being identified as retarded, especially\nin a society in which many people regarded black people as\nintellectually inferior (id. at 979).\nThe court correctly found that the EMR curriculum was\njustifiable only for children who have been properly diagnosed as\n\"retarded\" (495 F. Supp. at 937-942), and that EMR classes are so\ndesigned that they reduce the likelihood of a child's being able\nto move out and be exposed again to the normal curriculum (id. at\n942, 970). The court's findings about the history of IQ testing\nand its racist-xenophobic overtones support the finding that the\nlabel \"EMR\" and placement in special day classes is stigmatizing.\nThus, the use of isolated, dead-end EMR classes greatly exacer-\nbated the consequences of a misdiagnosis of retardation.\nSecond, the district court correctly reaffirmed that its\n1979 finding regarding the alleged bias of IQ tests was very\nlimited. Indeed, in 1979, the district court warned that (495 F.\nSupp. at 989) \"our decision * * * should not be construed as a\n\n- 18 -\nfinal judgment on the scientific validity of intelligence tests.\"\nThe court found in 1979 that the tests had disparate results and,\nin the context of EMR placement, adverse impact. Given the\ndisparate impact, the law requires that those responsible for\neducating children be sure the test is validated for the purpose\nfor which it is used. The court held in 1979 that \"the state has\nacted contrary to the law by requiring the use of tests that are\nracially and culturally discriminatory and have not been\nvalidated for labeling black E.M.R. children and placing them\ninto special classes for the mentally retarded\" (ibid.).1\nFurther, the court found as fact that, although the schools\nclaimed to rely on a multidimensional assessment for EMR\nplacement, a study showed this not to be the case, and, in fact,\nan IQ score below the cutoff generally destined children for EMR\nclasses (495 F. Supp. at 950).\nSo viewed, the findings in 1979 demanded only an injunction\nprohibiting reliance on IQ scores to identify children as edu-\ncable retarded. In particular,' the findings required prohibition\n2/ \nThe type of validity generally claimed for IQ tests is\ncriterion-related validity. This term refers only to statistical\ncorrelations between success on the test and success on the task\nto be performed, which in this case was the general school\ncurriculum. But the district court noted that prediction is not\nthe issue. Obviously, the children referred for testing have a\nrelatively poor educational prognosis absent the right kind of\nintervention. That is why they were referred for special\neducation in the first place. The issue is not \"prediction\" but,\nrather, the determination of what kind of intervention should be\nprescribed. The court decided that a test, even if a valid\npredictor of success or lack of it, could not be used as if it\nwere construct valid, that is, as if it actually diagnosed \"low\nintelligence.\" See 495 F. Supp. at 969.\n\n- 19 -\nof such reliance when the consequence was placement of black\nchildren in dead-end classes that were isolating and stigma-\ntizing. Under this interpretation, the injunction did not\npreclude the continued use of IQ tests to rule out retardation\n(especially to rule out severe retardation), or to identify\nspecific learning disabilities. This is the construction of the\ndistrict court opinion that the United States urged in this Court\nin 1981. It is also a fair description of what this Court held.\nSee, e.g., 793 F.2d at 979-980 (Rehabilitation Act and EHA), and\nat 981 (Title VI).\nAdmittedly, it was difficult to determine what constituted\ncompliance with the 1979 injunction. The 1986 injunction, more-\nover, assuredly prevented reliance on IQ scores -- by prohibiting\nIQ testing entirely. To that extent, the 1986 injunction was\nconsistent with the original findings. On the other hand, it\neliminated use of certain tests where their usefulness is at\nleast still open to debate.\nAppellants are incorrect in suggesting that the debate was\nconcluded in 1979. They mischaracterize the district court's\n1979 opinion by asserting that the district court found IQ tests\n\"cannot identify why a child is not learning nor assist in the\ndevelopment of an educational program for a child\" (Br. 7). At\nthe cited pages, the court actually said that an IQ score is\nsimply a statistical description of how the child performed -- on\nthat test -- relative to his or her age peers, and does not tell\n\n- 20 -\nus why that was the case (495 F. Supp. at 953, 973-974)../ It\nsaid nothing about the way in which IQ tests may (or may not)\nidentify specific learning disabilities. Contrary to the\nappellants' contention (Br. 7), the district court did not find\nassessments without IQ tests \"better tools\" than assessments that\nincluded such tests. What the court actually found was that\nusing alternative means of assessment for EMR had worked\n\"reasonably well\" (495 F. Supp. at 973), that alternative tests\n\"may be useful\" (id. at 973-974), and that, when denied the use\nof IQ testing, many psychologists went to more trouble to do the\nmultidimensional assessments they were supposed to do in the\nfirst place (ibid.). Moreover, the appellants ignore the dis-\ntrict court's disclaimer of having made a judgment as to the\nscientific worth of IQ tests for all purposes (id. at 989) and\nits 1992 disclaimer of having considered the usefulness of IQ\ntests to identify learning disabilities (CR 159 at 15). Thus,\nwhile the 1986 injunction was consistent with the original\nfindings, it went beyond it in a way that potentially prejudiced\nthe interests of many black children.\nFor example, a child could have a low score because he or\nshe had the flu, or was emotionally upset, or was exposed to a\ngreat deal of lead in early childhood; a low score, by\nhypothesis, tells us less than a high score.\n\n- 21 -\nII\nTHE DISTRICT COURT CORRECTLY HELD THAT THE 1986\nINJUNCTION WAS ENTERED WITHOUT ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION\nOF THE INTERESTS OF THE CRAWFORD PLAINTIFFS\nThe Larry P. class was certified under Rule 23(b)(2), Fed.\nR. Civ. P. This form of class certification does not offer\nanyone the opportunity to \"opt out.\" Actions prosecuted pursuant\nto this rule are therefore particularly vulnerable to being\ndirected by a single plaintiff (or a single attorney) genuinely\nconvinced of the justice of the cause he or she is pursuing.\nThis is why it is crucial that the representation of all members\nof the class be adequate at every stage of the proceedings. Rule\n23(a)(3) and (4), Fed. R. Civ. P.; Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32,\n40-43 (1940).\n\"Adequate representation as required by the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure Rule 23(a)(4) 'depends on the qualifications of\ncounsel for the representatives, an absence of antagonism, a\nsharing of interests between representatives and absentees, and\nthe unlikelihood that the suit is collusive'\" (Brown v. Ticor\nIns. Co., No. 91-15474 (9th Cir. Dec. 28, 1992) at 14813, quoting\nIn re N. Dist. of Cal. Dalkon Shield IUD Prods. Liab. Litig., 693\nF.2d 847, 855 (9th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1171\n(1983). In the present case, there was surely a potential\nantagonism among members of the class which the representatives\ndid not acknowledge and, indeed, continue to deny. It is crucial\nin such cases that no relief be entered by agreement or stipula-\ntion without the kind of hearing that allows for the active\n\n- 22 -\npresence of those class members who have interests that may\nconflict with those of the class representative (Rule 23(e), Fed.\nR. Civ. P.; Simer v. Rios, 661 F.2d 655, 664-665 (7th Cir. 1981),\ncert. denied, 456 U.S. 917 (1982)).- No such hearing was held in\nthis case. Thus, as the district court pointed out (CR 159 at\n13), the fact that some plaintiffs will later be able to\n\"extricate themselves from class action judgments if subsequent\ncourts find them to [have been] inadequately represented is\nintegral to the constitutionality of the class action procedure'\n[citation omitted].\"\nIt is clear that the Crawford plaintiffs are members of the\nLarry P. class, though the district court's ultimate definition\nof the Larry P. class was awkward. Pursuant to Rule 23(c)(3),\nthe court described in the judgment those whom the court found to\nbe members of the class (emphasis added): \"black children in\nCalifornia who have been or in the future will be wrongly placed\nand maintained in special classes for the 'educable mentally\nretarded\" (495 F. Supp. at 931). Although the term \"IQ tests\"\ndoes not appear, we know from the later context that to be\n\"wrongly placed\" is to be placed simply on the basis of an IQ\nfull-scale score.\nThe court's class description cannot be taken literally. A\nclass of persons protected cannot be the people who \"will be\"\nwronged. One way to read the class definition is that it\nincludes only those black children who have been or will in the\nfuture be tested and will receive a full-scale score of less than\n\n- 23 -\n70 on an IQ test. Such children, then, are protected by the\nLarry P. injunction from being placed in EMR classes (or\nidentified as EMR for substantially equivalent purposes) on the\nbasis, alone, of that score. If this is the correct description\nof the class, then the Crawford plaintiffs are not members of the\nclass (or were not, when they were refused IQ tests). Indeed, in\norder to be a member of the protected class, one must be black,\nand take an IQ test, and score below 70. If these plaintiffs are\nnot members of the class, there is no res judicata problem. The\nLarry P. judgment does not bind them and they were free to bring\ntheir equal protection case for being denied the opportunity to\ntake tests that are available to white children.\nIt might have been simpler if the district court had decided\nto analyze the res judicata issue this way in 1992. But it was\nnot the way that the district court chose, perhaps because the\ncourt did not wish, at this stage, to entertain the equal pro-\ntection issue. In all events, it was legitimate for the district\ncourt to characterize the class' it certified in Larry P. as \"all\nblack children in the school systems of California, including but\nnot limited to all black children who have been given IQ tests.\"\nThe 1979 injunction protected this class from being \"wrongly\nidentified and placed.\" The emphasis is not on test admini-\nstration, but on identification and placement. If identification\nof a child as EMR, and his or her placement in an EMR class (or\nits substantial equivalent) is not based upon a score, then the\nchild has not been \"wrongly identified\" or \"wrongly placed.\"\n\n- 24 -\nThe Crawford plaintiffs, as members of the Larry P. class, were\nprotected by the 1979 injunction from wrongful placement in EMR\nclasses in reliance on IQ scores. See Sam Fox Publishing Co. v.\nUnited States, 366 U.S. 683, 692-693 (1961) (plaintiffs were\nbound by prior class action to the extent, and only to the\nextent, that they were adequately represented there). Of course,\nthey were also protected from such wrongful placement by the 1986\ninjunction. But the latter injunction also blocked their access\nto tests they believed would be useful to identification, if not\ndiagnosis, of their specific learning problems.V\nIn the present phase of the case, the district court found\nthat no one had represented the interests of those members of the\nbroad Larry P. class (all black children in the State's public\nschools) who believed IQ testing to be useful for some, if not\nall, purposes. The court could equally well have found in 1992\nthat the 1986 injunction, entered as it was by stipulation, was\nentered without adequate notice to the broader class. Whether\nreasoning from Rule 23(a)(3) and (4) or Rule 23(e), the district\ncourt was correct in finding entry of the 1986 injunction to have\nviolated the due process rights of the Crawford plaintiffs.\nAppellants (including the State, apparently), in supporting\nthe 1986 injunction, continue to maintain that the State cannot\nbe trusted not to make placements in reliance on IQ scores, if\n2/ When the district court held that the IQ tests were not\n\"diagnostic,\" it meant only that they did not \"diagnose\" within\nthe medical model -- and specifically, did not diagnose a\nphysical condition known as retardation. See Br. 7.\n\n- 25 -\npsychologists and educators are allowed to obtain that inform-\nation at all. Accordingly, even if the Larry P. injunction only\nprotects children from improper EMR placements, they would prefer\nthat all tests be suspended until the district court finishes\nadjudicating the question of what constitutes the \"substantial\nequivalent\" of EMR classes (see Br. 21). In short, they would\nlike the 1986 injunction reinstated to serve in the nature of\npreliminary relief pending completion of the \"substantial\nequivalency\" hearing.\nThe Larry P. plaintiffs may be right that any use leads to\nreliance, and that the danger is great particularly if the\ncurrent system of special education is no improvement on the\nprevious one (see Br. 18). We do not read the district court's\nmost recent decision to reject the appellants' view entirely.\nAll the court has decided is that the subclass of people who\nbelieve their children might benefit from IQ testing were not\ngiven an opportunity to be heard when the court and the parties\njumped to the conclusion that a' total ban was the only way to\nprevent misuse of the tests. This denial of due process weighs\nheavily against the reinstitution of the 1986 injunction before,\nrather than after, the \"substantial equivalence\" issue is\nresolved.\nSignificantly, the district court, in 1992, made no finding\nthat the WISC-R tests or their Stanford-Binet equivalents are in\nfact useful to the identification of specific learning disabil-\nities. The district court has not written off the possibility\n\n- 26 -\nthat the original plaintiffs may yet introduce new or additional\nevidence showing that IQ tests necessarily distort the identi-\nfication of learning disabilities in black children, and that\nthis has an \"adverse\" effect as serious as the effect of\nmisplacement in EMR classes. When the district court takes up\nthe question of the present status of EMR classes (the\nsubstantial equivalence issue), it will undoubtedly hear more\nabout what effect IQ testing may have on black children.\nNor has the court ordered the resumption of IQ testing for\nanyone, black or white, pending further action by the court. See\nBr. 41-42. The court has simply declared that (1) the 1979 order\ndid not forbid use of those tests for the purposes proposed by\nthe Crawford plaintiffs; (2) the court would not now forbid it on\nthe basis, alone, of its own findings in Larry P.; and (3) had\nthe court been aware of who was affected and how they were\naffected, it would never have entered the 1986 order at all. The\neffect of lifting the 1986 injunction is temporarily to give the\nState the entire responsibility for deciding whether to admin-\nister (or refuse to administer) IQ tests to black children, and\nto risk being faced with an equal protection claim if they refuse\nto do so on the basis of race.\nIII\nTHE CASE IS JUSTICIABLE\nAppellants devote large portions of their brief to arguing\nthat the Crawford plaintiffs presented no justiciable issue, and\nthat the district court held to the contrary without making the\n\n- 27 -\nnecessary subordinate findings (Br. 23-38). One branch of this\nargument is that the Crawford plaintiffs were in fact given the\nforbidden IQ tests, and therefore have no redressable grievance\n(Br. 23-33). The second branch of this contention is that --\nwith or without IQ tests -- the Crawford plaintiffs have been\nassigned to the proper form of special education, and therefore\nthey have no remediable grievance.\nAs amicus, we do not address these issues in detail. It\nwould appear that there are four plaintiff children still in the\ncase: Demond Crawford, Barbara Florence, James Florence, and\nTerence Pina (see dismissals at CR 75). Each of these children\nwas tested for special education during the 1980s, but with one\nexception, they were not given the tests that were on the\n\"forbidden\" list. See Declaration of Devena Reed, CR 52, at 9,\n11, 17, 22. The only one . to receive a WISC-R was James Florence,\nand that was in April 1986, prior to the September 1986\ninjunction. James Florence, moreover, is still of school age\n(see attachment to CR 52 showing Florence to have been born in\n1977) and presumably will need to be retested during his school\ncareer, especially since he is in a special day class (Br. 26).\nMoreover, it is clear that the district court would have\ncertified the subclass had the court not been able to end the\ncase on due process grounds immediately. 10(cid:9)Thus, he is one\n10(cid:9)\nThe district court, when it denied subclass certification,\ncertainly was not influenced by the small number of named\nplaintiffs. Numerosity has nothing to do with it (Br. 40-41).\nThere is no rule that class representatives must be numerous --\nonly that they represent a class too numerous for ordinary joinder.\n\n- 28 -\nplaintiff who apparently had standing when he sued, and as to\nwhom the case is not moot, which the appellants concede (Br. 26,\n31).\nThe argument that no educational harm was shown misses the\npoint. The plaintiffs' standing was based on a claim of having\nsuffered a constitutional injury, i.e., being denied an IQ test\nsolely because of an order that was entered without their being\nheard. 11 A merits question remains to be decided: assuming\nblack children cannot be placed in EMR on the basis of IQ scores,\nis it protective to deny them IQ testing, or is it a deprivation?\nThis merits question has never been decided. Appellants, by\nstating what they believe to be the answer (Br. 27-31), are again\ntaking as decided that which they thought should have been\nsettled in Larry P. but which clearly was not.\n111(cid:9)\nBecause plaintiffs presented a constitutional question,\nthey clearly did not have to exhaust administrative remedies\nassociated with the Education For All Handicapped Children Act.\nIn addition, the form their action took was a Rule 60(b) motion.\nIf one is already a party to a suit and wishes to make a post-\njudgment motion, there are no administrative remedies to exhaust.\n\n- 29 -\nCONCLUSION\nThe judgment below should be affirmed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJAMES P.

Riles, a civil rights action, under 28 U.S.C. 1331 and 1343.\nThe Crawford parties, as members of the Larry P. class, made a\nmotion under Rule 60, Fed. R. Civ. P., and it was granted,\nthereby finally disposing of their claim. This Court has juris-\ndiction of the appeal from that final judgment under 28 U.S.C.\n1291. As for the Larry P. appellants, the district court's\n\n-2-\naction constituted the dissolution of an injunction, subject to\nimmediate appeal under 28 U.S.C. 1292(a)(1).\nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES\nThis case involves the uses and abuses of IQ testing for\npurposes of special education of black children. The United\nStates has substantial interest in these issues. The United\nStates has an interest in assuring that funds distributed under\nthe Education For All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, 20 U.S.C.\n1400, et seq. (now renamed the Individuals With Disabilities\nEducation Act) are administered in a manner consistent with the\nterms of the Act. The United States is also charged with the\nresponsibility of coordinating enforcement of Title VI of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, and Section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794. See Executive Order\n12250 (Nov. 2, 1980). Finally, the United States has enforcement\nresponsibilities under Title II of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 12131, et seq. The United\nStates participated as amicus curiae in the original Larry P.\nlitigation, both in the district court and in this Court,i\" and\nhas requested the district court for permission to resume its\nparticipation in the next phase of the case.\nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES PRESENTED\n1.

Whether the case is justiciable.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nThis matter was decided on summary judgment and is subject\nto de novo review by this Court.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n1. The original suit\nAs of 1969, the State of California recognized four state-\nreimbursable categories of special education. Two of the cate-\ngories assumed potential for average or above-average achievement\nin school, but that the children in question were either \"cultur-\nally disadvantaged\" or \"educationally handicapped.\" The latter\nterm encompassed emotional and neurological disturbances, and\nspecific learning disabilities such as dyslexia. The other two\ncategories assumed that the children could never master the\nnormal school curriculum because they were either profoundly\nretarded (Trainable Mentally Retarded (TMR)) or mildly retarded\n(Educable Mentally Retarded (EMR)). EMR classes were geared to\nbasic living skills, with reading and other academic disciplines\n\n- 4 -\ndeemphasized (Larry P. v. Riles, 495 F. Supp. 926, 937-939, 941-\n942 (N.D. Cal. 1979). As of 1970, state law prohibited placement\nin EMR of any child whose full-scale IQ score was 70 or above\n(id. at 948).Z/ On the other hand,- state law also mandated that\nplacement decisions be made on the basis of thorough, pro-\nfessional assessment of a child's developmental history and\nadaptive behavior as well as IQ score (ibid.).\nIn November 1971, suit was filed on behalf of six black\nelementary school children, representing \"all black San Francisco\nschool children who have been classified as mentally retarded on\nthe bases of I.Q. test results\" (Larry P. v. Riles, 343 F. Supp.\n1306, 1315 (N.D. Cal. 1972). The class defined, in the end, was\na statewide class of \"black children in California who have been\nThe most popular IQ tests, the Stanford-Binet and the\nWechsler tests (in this case, usually the Wechsler Intelligence\nScale for Children-revised, or WISC-R), are comprised of a large\nnumber of subtests which measure different facets of cognitive\nfunctioning such as picture assembly, memory, sequencing,\nvocabulary, general information, etc. Scores may be obtained for\neach subtest, for the verbal alone, for the performance side\nalone, or for the entire test (see 495 F. Supp. at 958). The raw\nscore on the full test can be converted into a score based on a\nnormal curve defining the norm as 100 and one standard deviation\nfrom the norm as 15. This is the \"full-scale score\" that is\npopularly known as IQ. Thus, an IQ of 70 represents two standard\ndeviations below the norm (495 F. Supp. at 952-954).\nThe history of IQ testing, which was proffered at trial to\nshow it was racially biased, was generally the history of the\nBinet test as developed at Stanford University by Professor Lewis\nTerman (id. at 935). The data cited by the district court\nshowing blacks to have a lower norm as a group were from the\nStanford-Binet and the WISC-R (id. at 954 & n.59). Although the\nevidence presented at trial was generally about these two tests,\nall the tests considered by the SDE to test \"intelligence\" ended\nup on the list of tests prohibited for EMR placement (see id. at\n931 n.3).\n\n-5-\nor in the future will be wrongly placed and maintained in special\nclasses for the 'educable mentally retarded' ('E.M.R.')\" (495 F.\nSupp. at 931).\nThe Larry P. plaintiffs began with two undisputed premises:\n(1) blacks as a group score one standard deviation below whites\non standardized IQ tests (id. at 934, 954); and (2) black\nchildren comprised  far greater proportion of EMR students than\ntheir proportion in the general school population (id. at 942-\n945). The plaintiffs sought to prove that, by defining EMR in\nterms of IQ test results, the State had knowingly and inten-\ntionally designed a system that would relegate a disproportionate\nnumber of black children to \"dead end\" classes, in violation of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment (id. at 942-951). In addition, they\nalleged that the practices in question violated the two federal\nstatutes, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Education\nFor All Handicapped Children Act, that require tests to be\nvalidated for the purposes for which they are used. Using\nunvalidated tests, they said, causes or risks causing children to\nbe perceived as handicapped (i.e., retarded) when they are not.\nSimilarly, they argued, such tests violate Title VI and/or its\nimplementing regulations, when, in addition to being unvalidated,\nthey have a racially disproportionate impact. See, generally,\n495 F. Supp. at 960-961).\nTrial was held from October 11, 1977, to March 15, 1978. A\nsubstantial portion of the trial was devoted to the debate\nregarding the built-in bias in IQ testing (495 F. Supp. at 953-\n\n- 6 -\n960). The district court found that the IQ tests in question\nwere in fact \"racially and culturally biased\" in the sense that\nthey have a disparate impact, i.e., that blacks as a group have a\nlower mean full-scale score than do whites as a group, and no one\nhas been able to give an adequate explanation why this should be\nso (id. at 955-957). Nor had anyone adequately shown that, for\nblacks, the full-scale IQ scores below 70 (but above the TMR\nlevel)V actually represent true, irremediable retardation (id.\nat 959-960). Accordingly, IQ scores constituted an \"unvalidated\"\nbasis for assigning black children to EMR classes (id. at 968-\n973). The district court found, as well, that -- state law\nnotwithstanding -- the school districts were placing black\nchildren in EMR classes in reliance entirely on IQ scores, rather\nthan on multidimensional assessments (id. at 948-950).\nThe district court entered judgment for the Larry P.\nplaintiffs with respect to all their constitutional and statutory\nclaims. The court enjoined the defendants \"from utilizing,\npermitting the use of, or approving the use of any standardized\nintelligence tests, including those now approved pursuant to Cal.\nAdmin. Code [section] 3401, for the identification of black\nE.M.R. children or their placement into E.M.R. classes, without\nsecuring prior approval by this court\" (495 F. Supp. at 989).\nNeither plaintiffs nor anyone else apparently disputes that\nIQ tests can detect, in both blacks and whites, true severe or\nprofound retardation, the type that the State called \"trainable\nmentally retarded\" (TMR). Blacks are not overrepresented among\nTMR students. Nor did anyone question the accuracy of full-scale\nIQ scores below 70 as defining retardation in white children,\nthough that remains an open question.\n\n-7-\n\"E.M.R.\" was defined as the category then created by the\nCalifornia Code \"or a substantially equivalent category,\" and the\nterm \"E.M.R. classes\" was defined to include the existing EMR\nclasses or any others to be created later to serve \"substantially\nthe same functions\" (ibid.). Thus, the decree anticipated that\nthere would be major changes in the near future in the special\neducation program and the categories it created.\n2. The appeal\nIn January 1984, this Court affirmed the district court's\njudgment on statutory grounds alone, not reaching the\nconstitutional issue. Defendant Riles, the State Superintendent\nand sole appellant, sought rehearing, and the court issued an\namended opinion upon the denial of rehearing on June 25, 1986.\nIn the amended opinion, the court of appeals affirmed the\ndistrict court's finding of statutory violations, but reversed\nthe finding of intentional discrimination, in violation of the\nFourteenth Amendment, by Wilson Riles (Larry P. v. Riles, 793\nF.2d 969, 984 (9th Cir. 1984).\n3. The second stage\nBy 1986, when the decision became final, California had --\nor claimed to have -- abolished EMR classes. It is not entirely\nclear what was happening between 1979 and 1986, except that the\nState apparently permitted the school districts to administer IQ\ntests to black children. Answers to interrogatories served by\nthe Larry P. plaintiffs revealed that the SDE had interpreted the\nLarry P. order, not to prohibit administration of IQ tests, but\n\n-8-\nto eliminate \"the placement and retention of children in\nisolated special day classes on the basis of only an IQ score\"\n(CR 159 at 11).i/ Whether there still were such classes or not,\nthe State instructed, when a black child scored in the \"EMR\nrange, other forms of assessment [should] be used to determine\nthe child's placement\" (ibid.). (In this context, placement\ndenotes, simply, the formulation of the child's Individualized\nEducational Plan (IEP)). Where test results were above the EMR\nrange, however, the directive presumably permitted psychologists\nto apply the same interpretive techniques with respect to black\nchildren as they would for white children.\nThe Larry P. plaintiffs believed that EMR classes had con-\ntinued in all but name (Br. 3). In fact, they were prepared to\nargue that the State's school districts had simply made it more\ndifficult to locate the children relegated to dead-end tracks.\nThus, the only way to prevent IQ testing \"for EMR\" was to prevent\nIQ testing for all special education. Second, they did not\nbelieve that there was any way to prevent reliance on IQ scores\nother than to ban administration of the tests. Moreover, they\nbelieved the original injunction had prohibited administration of\nIQ tests to black children, at least as long as there was any\nrisk that those children would end up identified as educable\n1\"\t\n\"CR \" refers to the docket entries in the district court\nclerk's record for Crawford v. Honig, Civil Action 89-CV-14\n(RFP), after it was transferred to the Northern District of\nCalifornia.

It\nfollowed that, from the Larry P. plaintiffs' point of view, the\nState was violating the original Larry P. injunction with its\ndirective permitting IQ tests to be administered to black\nchildren. Accordingly, on threat of moving for contempt, the\nLarry P. plaintiffs induced the SDE to enter into a stipulated\nrevision of the 1979 injunction.\nUnder the new injunction, entered September 25, 1986, and\nmodified on November 19, 1986, all school districts in the State\nwere ordered not to administer any \"intelligence\" test to any\nblack child referred for special education assessment, even if\nthe parents asked for it. If such testing was done privately or\nin another school system, the schools must send the protocols\nback and not place them in the child's file. See CR 159 at 5-6.\nThis injunction was embodied in SDE directives dated December 3,\n1986, and February 8, 1988 (Appendices A and B to Complaint, CR\n1)\nMeanwhile, in May 1987, a black school child in Fontana,\nCalifornia, was referred for testing as a possible candidate for\nspecial education. In the notification to his mother (Mrs.\nAmaya), there was a note saying that \"[blecause Demond [Crawfordl\nis Black, we will be unable to give him an intelligence test per\nPeckham decision\" (emphasis in the original) (Exhibit A to\nPlaintiffs' Supplemental Memorandum Regarding the Question of\nMootness, CR 59). This and several instances like it provoked\n\n- 10 -\nthe filing of the new action, originally in the Central District\nof California.\n4. The new suit: Crawford, et al. v. Honig\nOn May 10, 1988, suit was filed in the Central District of\nCalifornia on behalf of eight black school children, mostly from\nSan Bernardino and San Diego Counties, against the State Superin-\ntendent and the California State Board of Education (CV 88-02668\nAWT (Kx) (C.D. Cal.), incorporated in CR 1; see also CR 159 at\n5.) They alleged generally that each is or may be learning\ndisabled, neurologically impaired, or behaviorally or emotionally\ndisturbed. All had been referred for testing, but were notified\nthat they would not be permitted to take an intelligence test (CR\n1 (complaint) at 3-6, 9).\nThe complaint recognized that the prohibition in the\nDecember 3, 1986, directive was a product of the Larry P. case,\nbut the new plaintiffs apparently did not know about the\nSeptember 1986 order. They alleged that the Superintendent and\nBoard had issued directives that \"exceed[ed] the scope of the\nfederal courts' decision in Larry P. v. Riles\" (CR 1 (complaint,\npar. 32) at 10). Those directives, they alleged, denied the\nCrawford plaintiffs due process by enlarging the prohibition on\nIQ testing, in a manner that affected their interests, without a\nhearing (id. at 10-i1). In addition, they claimed, the direc-\ntives denied them (or their children) equal protection and rights\nunder Title VI by denying them access to the same tests available\nto white, Hispanic, Oriental, and other children (CR 1\n\n- 11 -\n(complaint) at 7, 10-14). The complaint also alleged that the\nprohibition violated 20 U.S.C. 1415(e)(4)(A) (of the Education\nFor All Handicapped Children Act) because it was \"racially and\nculturally discriminatory\" to refuse to let the plaintiffs take\nthe same tests as were available to all non-black children (CR 1\n(complaint) at 14-16).\nThe Crawford plaintiffs asked the court to enjoin the\nDecember 3, 1986 directive (CR 1 (complaint) at 20), to order the\ndefendants to administer appropriate intelligence tests to the\nplaintiff children (id. at 21-23), and to enjoin implementation\nof the directive to purge black children's records of IQ scores\n(ibid.) .\nThe suit was transferred to the Northern District of\nCalifornia on January 4, 1989, and assigned to Judge Peckham as a\n\"related case\" (CR 1 and 3). In March 1989, the Crawford\nplaintiffs moved to have the case consolidated with Larry P. (CR\n8, 9, and 13). On June 14, 1990, the district court denied the\nState defendants' motion to dismiss (CR 63 (teleconference); CR\n159 at 5-6). In July 1991, the district court granted the motion\nto consolidate the two cases and granted the Crawford plaintiffs'\nmotion for a preliminary injunction (CR 126; CR 159 at 7). On\nAugust 31, 1992, the district court entered summary judgment for\nthe Crawford plaintiffs and vacated the 1986 modification to the\nLarry P. injunction.-/\nThe court \"directed\" the SDE to rescind the directive that,\nin December 1986, implemented the 1986 injunction (docket no. 159\n(continued...)\n\n- 12 -\n5. The district court's 1992 opinion\nFirst, the court looked at its own 1979 findings of fact,\nand held that the \"1986 modification expanded the 1979 order\nbeyond the findings of the court\" (CR 159 at 7). The court\nreasoned that the original case concerned the use of IQ test\nscores in the context of EMR placement, and did not purport to\nlimit access to testing for learning disabilities (id. at 14-\n15). Indeed, the court expressed the view that the SDE direc-\ntives that went out between 1979 and 1986 -- indicating that it\nwas legitimate to administer IQ tests, but not to rely on the\nfull-scale score to place blacks in EMR -- was probably a fair\ninterpretation of the 1979 order, not contempt (id. at 19).\n\"Despite the Defendants' attempts to characterize the court's\n1979 order as a referendum on the discriminatory nature of IQ\ntesting,\" the court noted (id. at 23), \"this court's review of\nthe decision reveals that the decision was largely concerned with\nthe harm to African-American children resulting from improper\nplacement in dead-end educational programs.\"\nSecond, the district court reviewed the 1986 modification\n\"hearing.\" The court noted that the parties to that hearing\n(...continued)\nat 22). The actual injunction, however, does not contain that\nlanguage. As discussed below, we assume this permits the State\nto reinstitute its ban on IQ testing, either across the board or\nfor blacks only. The latter would, of course, open the State up\nto a renewed equal protection challenge. Meanwhile, the court\ndeclared the Crawford litigation at an end, and indicated that\nthe Crawford parties would have to seek to intervene in the\ndistrict court if they want to participate in the next round of\nhearings (id. at 24-25).\n\n- 13 -\n\"provided no evidence to support the conclusion that the\nsubstantial equivalent of EMR meant all special educational\nprograms\" (CR 159 at 20) (emphasis in the original). \"Nor was an\nattempt made to identify current 'dead end' programs substan-\ntially equivalent to the old EMR program\" (ibid.). This determi-\nnation would have to be made at some later date (id. at 22-23).\nThird, the court found that the Crawford plaintiffs were in\nfact part of the original Larry P. class. If tested, any child\nmight score below 70 and might be diagnosed as educable mentally\nretarded (CR 159 at 10). The interests of children who might\nscore above the EMR range were not prejudiced by the 1979 in-\njunction or by SDE's interpretation of it (ibid.); they could\ntake the test, but not be placed in EMR on the basis of the IQ\nscore alone (id. at 10-12). The order completely banning admini-\nstration of IQ tests to black children was merely an \"enforce-\nment\" or \"clarification\" of the 1979 order as applied to children\nwho, if tested, would score below 70; however, it also impinged\non the interests of those who would score above 70, and whose\nparents thought the test might be useful for diagnosis of\nlearning disabilities (id. at 12). No one, however, represented\nthe interest of potentially learning disabled black children\n(i.e., their interest in being tested) at the time of the 1986\nhearing and injunction. On the contrary, the order was entered\nby stipulation, \"crafted through private negotiation * * * and\nnot through extensive public discussion and debate\" (id. at 21).\nThis quasi-settlement incurred the \"same risks for compromise to\n\n- 14 -\nclass interests as are present in any class settlement or\nvoluntary dismissal under Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure,\" the court pointed out (ibid.).\nKs members of the Larry P. class, the court held, the\nCrawford plaintiffs could move under Rule 60(b)(4), Fed. R. Civ.\nP., to be relieved of the 1986 decree (CR 159 at 16-17). Once\nhaving made that motion, the court ruled, it was up to the court\nto decide whether they were barred by res judicata. The court\nconcluded that, because their particular subclass interests had\nnot been adequately represented in 1986, due process prevented\ntheir being bound by the 1986 judgment as members of the Larry P.\nclass (id. at 12-17), and they were free to make a collateral\nequal protection attack on the 1986 injunction. But due process\nrequired, in any event, that the 1986 injunction be vacated (id.\nat 21). Thus, the court declined to reach the equal protection\nissue raised by the Crawford plaintiffs (id. at 22, 26). The\ncourt (1) granted summary judgment for the Crawford plaintiffs on\ndue process grounds; and (2) ordered the 1986 injunction\nrescinded (id. at 26). In addition, the court noted that\n\"[b]ecause the EMR program is no longer operative, * * * further\naction is required to give meaning to the 1979 ruling in the\ncurrent educational system\" (id. at 23). The court also offered\nthe Larry P. plaintiffs an opportunity to show, at that hearing,\nthat IQ tests prejudiced the interests of all black children, not\n\n- 15 -\njust those whose full-scale IQ scores turned out to be below 70\n(id. at 22-24)./\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThe 1986 injunction entered in Larry P. had far-ranging\nimplications. Under that injunction, the school systems in\nCalifornia were prohibited from administering all tests denom-\ninated \"intelligence\" tests to African-American children. Thus,\nif a teacher referred a black child with learning problems for\nevaluation, the psychologists were absolutely barred from\nadministering such tests to that child.\nNeither the findings nor the injunction in the original\nLarry P. case justified the entry of the 1986 injunction without\na thorough \"fairness\" hearing and opportunity for all subclasses\nto be heard. The district court in Larry P. did not adjudicate\nthe usefulness to black children of IQ tests or subtests for all\npurposes. It found only that the full-scale IQ scores -- at\nleast on certain tests -- when they are below 70, cannot be\ncounted on to diagnose the sort of retardation that is compatible\nwith EMR placement as it then existed.\nAny injunction that exceeded the scope of that finding\nnecessarily impinged on the interests of children whose IQs would\nturn out to be above 70. Indeed, the 1986 injunction potentially\ndenied psychologists access to procedures that would be useful\nfor identifying the difficulties suffered by learning disabled\nThe United States has already asked the district court for\npermission to resume its participation as amicus curiae in these\nfurther hearings.\n\n- 16 -\nblack children. The district court did not, in all events,\npurport in 1992 to decide the merits of using the Stanford-Binet,\nWechsler, or other \"IQ\" tests to identify learning disabilities.\nIt decided only that the court's own 1986 order prohibiting their\nuse violated the due process rights of the Crawford plaintiffs,\nfor it impinged on their interests without their being heard.\nBy declaring the ban on all IQ testing to be beyond the\nscope of the Larry P. findings and injunction, the district court\nsimply opened this area for further voluntary state action and,\nperhaps, for later litigation. The court has not vacated its\n1979 injunction protecting African-American children from\nplacement in EMR classes on the basis of IQ scores. On the\ncontrary, the court has indicated it will hold further hearings\nto determine what constitutes the equivalent of EMR placement in\nthe California educational system of today. Requiring the\ndistrict court to reinstate the 1986 injunction, however, would\nclose down the inquiry permanently. Accordingly, this Court\nshould affirm.\nARGUMENT\nI\nTHE 1986 INJUNCTION EXCEEDED THE FINDINGS IN LARRY P.\nAppellants sought to justify the 1986 injunction by claiming\nthat it merely implemented the findings in the original Larry P.\ncase, and was necessitated by the State's disobedience to the\n1979 injunction. The district court held to the contrary. In so\ndoing, the district court merely construed its own 1979 opinion\n\n- 17 -\nand order. This required the resolution of no disputed facts and\ntherefore could be done in the context of a summary judgment\nmotion.\nThe district court's 1992 decision is faithful to its\noriginal findings and injunction. According to the district\ncourt, the central issue of Larry P. was always EMR classes --\ntheir isolation frcim the rest of the school population (495 F.\nSupp. at 979), the startlingly disproportionate number of black\nchildren who ended up in these classes (id. at 942-945, 951-955,\n979), and the stigma of being identified as retarded, especially\nin a society in which many people regarded black people as\nintellectually inferior (id. at 979).\nThe court correctly found that the EMR curriculum was\njustifiable only for children who have been properly diagnosed as\n\"retarded\" (495 F. Supp. at 937-942), and that EMR classes are so\ndesigned that they reduce the likelihood of a child's being able\nto move out and be exposed again to the normal curriculum (id. at\n942, 970). The court's findings about the history of IQ testing\nand its racist-xenophobic overtones support the finding that the\nlabel \"EMR\" and placement in special day classes is stigmatizing.\nThus, the use of isolated, dead-end EMR classes greatly exacer-\nbated the consequences of a misdiagnosis of retardation.\nSecond, the district court correctly reaffirmed that its\n1979 finding regarding the alleged bias of IQ tests was very\nlimited. Indeed, in 1979, the district court warned that (495 F.\nSupp. at 989) \"our decision * * * should not be construed as a\n\n- 18 -\nfinal judgment on the scientific validity of intelligence tests.\"\nThe court found in 1979 that the tests had disparate results and,\nin the context of EMR placement, adverse impact. Given the\ndisparate impact, the law requires that those responsible for\neducating children be sure the test is validated for the purpose\nfor which it is used. The court held in 1979 that \"the state has\nacted contrary to the law by requiring the use of tests that are\nracially and culturally discriminatory and have not been\nvalidated for labeling black E.M.R. children and placing them\ninto special classes for the mentally retarded\" (ibid.).1\nFurther, the court found as fact that, although the schools\nclaimed to rely on a multidimensional assessment for EMR\nplacement, a study showed this not to be the case, and, in fact,\nan IQ score below the cutoff generally destined children for EMR\nclasses (495 F. Supp. at 950).\nSo viewed, the findings in 1979 demanded only an injunction\nprohibiting reliance on IQ scores to identify children as edu-\ncable retarded. In particular,' the findings required prohibition\n2/ \nThe type of validity generally claimed for IQ tests is\ncriterion-related validity. This term refers only to statistical\ncorrelations between success on the test and success on the task\nto be performed, which in this case was the general school\ncurriculum. But the district court noted that prediction is not\nthe issue. Obviously, the children referred for testing have a\nrelatively poor educational prognosis absent the right kind of\nintervention. That is why they were referred for special\neducation in the first place. The issue is not \"prediction\" but,\nrather, the determination of what kind of intervention should be\nprescribed. The court decided that a test, even if a valid\npredictor of success or lack of it, could not be used as if it\nwere construct valid, that is, as if it actually diagnosed \"low\nintelligence.\" See 495 F. Supp. at 969.\n\n- 19 -\nof such reliance when the consequence was placement of black\nchildren in dead-end classes that were isolating and stigma-\ntizing. Under this interpretation, the injunction did not\npreclude the continued use of IQ tests to rule out retardation\n(especially to rule out severe retardation), or to identify\nspecific learning disabilities. This is the construction of the\ndistrict court opinion that the United States urged in this Court\nin 1981. It is also a fair description of what this Court held.\nSee, e.g., 793 F.2d at 979-980 (Rehabilitation Act and EHA), and\nat 981 (Title VI).\nAdmittedly, it was difficult to determine what constituted\ncompliance with the 1979 injunction. The 1986 injunction, more-\nover, assuredly prevented reliance on IQ scores -- by prohibiting\nIQ testing entirely. To that extent, the 1986 injunction was\nconsistent with the original findings. On the other hand, it\neliminated use of certain tests where their usefulness is at\nleast still open to debate.\nAppellants are incorrect in suggesting that the debate was\nconcluded in 1979. They mischaracterize the district court's\n1979 opinion by asserting that the district court found IQ tests\n\"cannot identify why a child is not learning nor assist in the\ndevelopment of an educational program for a child\" (Br. 7). At\nthe cited pages, the court actually said that an IQ score is\nsimply a statistical description of how the child performed -- on\nthat test -- relative to his or her age peers, and does not tell\n\n- 20 -\nus why that was the case (495 F. Supp. at 953, 973-974)../ It\nsaid nothing about the way in which IQ tests may (or may not)\nidentify specific learning disabilities. Contrary to the\nappellants' contention (Br. 7), the district court did not find\nassessments without IQ tests \"better tools\" than assessments that\nincluded such tests. What the court actually found was that\nusing alternative means of assessment for EMR had worked\n\"reasonably well\" (495 F. Supp. at 973), that alternative tests\n\"may be useful\" (id. at 973-974), and that, when denied the use\nof IQ testing, many psychologists went to more trouble to do the\nmultidimensional assessments they were supposed to do in the\nfirst place (ibid.). Moreover, the appellants ignore the dis-\ntrict court's disclaimer of having made a judgment as to the\nscientific worth of IQ tests for all purposes (id. at 989) and\nits 1992 disclaimer of having considered the usefulness of IQ\ntests to identify learning disabilities (CR 159 at 15). Thus,\nwhile the 1986 injunction was consistent with the original\nfindings, it went beyond it in a way that potentially prejudiced\nthe interests of many black children.\nFor example, a child could have a low score because he or\nshe had the flu, or was emotionally upset, or was exposed to a\ngreat deal of lead in early childhood; a low score, by\nhypothesis, tells us less than a high score.\n\n- 21 -\nII\nTHE DISTRICT COURT CORRECTLY HELD THAT THE 1986\nINJUNCTION WAS ENTERED WITHOUT ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION\nOF THE INTERESTS OF THE CRAWFORD PLAINTIFFS\nThe Larry P. class was certified under Rule 23(b)(2), Fed.\nR. Civ. P. This form of class certification does not offer\nanyone the opportunity to \"opt out.\" Actions prosecuted pursuant\nto this rule are therefore particularly vulnerable to being\ndirected by a single plaintiff (or a single attorney) genuinely\nconvinced of the justice of the cause he or she is pursuing.\nThis is why it is crucial that the representation of all members\nof the class be adequate at every stage of the proceedings. Rule\n23(a)(3) and (4), Fed. R. Civ. P.; Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32,\n40-43 (1940).\n\"Adequate representation as required by the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure Rule 23(a)(4) 'depends on the qualifications of\ncounsel for the representatives, an absence of antagonism, a\nsharing of interests between representatives and absentees, and\nthe unlikelihood that the suit is collusive'\" (Brown v. Ticor\nIns. Co., No. 91-15474 (9th Cir. Dec. 28, 1992) at 14813, quoting\nIn re N. Dist. of Cal. Dalkon Shield IUD Prods. Liab. Litig., 693\nF.2d 847, 855 (9th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1171\n(1983). In the present case, there was surely a potential\nantagonism among members of the class which the representatives\ndid not acknowledge and, indeed, continue to deny. It is crucial\nin such cases that no relief be entered by agreement or stipula-\ntion without the kind of hearing that allows for the active\n\n- 22 -\npresence of those class members who have interests that may\nconflict with those of the class representative (Rule 23(e), Fed.\nR. Civ. P.; Simer v. Rios, 661 F.2d 655, 664-665 (7th Cir. 1981),\ncert. denied, 456 U.S. 917 (1982)).- No such hearing was held in\nthis case. Thus, as the district court pointed out (CR 159 at\n13), the fact that some plaintiffs will later be able to\n\"extricate themselves from class action judgments if subsequent\ncourts find them to [have been] inadequately represented is\nintegral to the constitutionality of the class action procedure'\n[citation omitted].\"\nIt is clear that the Crawford plaintiffs are members of the\nLarry P. class, though the district court's ultimate definition\nof the Larry P. class was awkward. Pursuant to Rule 23(c)(3),\nthe court described in the judgment those whom the court found to\nbe members of the class (emphasis added): \"black children in\nCalifornia who have been or in the future will be wrongly placed\nand maintained in special classes for the 'educable mentally\nretarded\" (495 F. Supp. at 931). Although the term \"IQ tests\"\ndoes not appear, we know from the later context that to be\n\"wrongly placed\" is to be placed simply on the basis of an IQ\nfull-scale score.\nThe court's class description cannot be taken literally. A\nclass of persons protected cannot be the people who \"will be\"\nwronged. One way to read the class definition is that it\nincludes only those black children who have been or will in the\nfuture be tested and will receive a full-scale score of less than\n\n- 23 -\n70 on an IQ test. Such children, then, are protected by the\nLarry P. injunction from being placed in EMR classes (or\nidentified as EMR for substantially equivalent purposes) on the\nbasis, alone, of that score. If this is the correct description\nof the class, then the Crawford plaintiffs are not members of the\nclass (or were not, when they were refused IQ tests). Indeed, in\norder to be a member of the protected class, one must be black,\nand take an IQ test, and score below 70. If these plaintiffs are\nnot members of the class, there is no res judicata problem. The\nLarry P. judgment does not bind them and they were free to bring\ntheir equal protection case for being denied the opportunity to\ntake tests that are available to white children.\nIt might have been simpler if the district court had decided\nto analyze the res judicata issue this way in 1992. But it was\nnot the way that the district court chose, perhaps because the\ncourt did not wish, at this stage, to entertain the equal pro-\ntection issue. In all events, it was legitimate for the district\ncourt to characterize the class' it certified in Larry P. as \"all\nblack children in the school systems of California, including but\nnot limited to all black children who have been given IQ tests.\"\nThe 1979 injunction protected this class from being \"wrongly\nidentified and placed.\" The emphasis is not on test admini-\nstration, but on identification and placement. If identification\nof a child as EMR, and his or her placement in an EMR class (or\nits substantial equivalent) is not based upon a score, then the\nchild has not been \"wrongly identified\" or \"wrongly placed.\"\n\n- 24 -\nThe Crawford plaintiffs, as members of the Larry P. class, were\nprotected by the 1979 injunction from wrongful placement in EMR\nclasses in reliance on IQ scores. See Sam Fox Publishing Co. v.\nUnited States, 366 U.S. 683, 692-693 (1961) (plaintiffs were\nbound by prior class action to the extent, and only to the\nextent, that they were adequately represented there). Of course,\nthey were also protected from such wrongful placement by the 1986\ninjunction. But the latter injunction also blocked their access\nto tests they believed would be useful to identification, if not\ndiagnosis, of their specific learning problems.V\nIn the present phase of the case, the district court found\nthat no one had represented the interests of those members of the\nbroad Larry P. class (all black children in the State's public\nschools) who believed IQ testing to be useful for some, if not\nall, purposes. The court could equally well have found in 1992\nthat the 1986 injunction, entered as it was by stipulation, was\nentered without adequate notice to the broader class. Whether\nreasoning from Rule 23(a)(3) and (4) or Rule 23(e), the district\ncourt was correct in finding entry of the 1986 injunction to have\nviolated the due process rights of the Crawford plaintiffs.\nAppellants (including the State, apparently), in supporting\nthe 1986 injunction, continue to maintain that the State cannot\nbe trusted not to make placements in reliance on IQ scores, if\n2/ When the district court held that the IQ tests were not\n\"diagnostic,\" it meant only that they did not \"diagnose\" within\nthe medical model -- and specifically, did not diagnose a\nphysical condition known as retardation. See Br. 7.\n\n- 25 -\npsychologists and educators are allowed to obtain that inform-\nation at all. Accordingly, even if the Larry P. injunction only\nprotects children from improper EMR placements, they would prefer\nthat all tests be suspended until the district court finishes\nadjudicating the question of what constitutes the \"substantial\nequivalent\" of EMR classes (see Br. 21). In short, they would\nlike the 1986 injunction reinstated to serve in the nature of\npreliminary relief pending completion of the \"substantial\nequivalency\" hearing.\nThe Larry P. plaintiffs may be right that any use leads to\nreliance, and that the danger is great particularly if the\ncurrent system of special education is no improvement on the\nprevious one (see Br. 18). We do not read the district court's\nmost recent decision to reject the appellants' view entirely.\nAll the court has decided is that the subclass of people who\nbelieve their children might benefit from IQ testing were not\ngiven an opportunity to be heard when the court and the parties\njumped to the conclusion that a' total ban was the only way to\nprevent misuse of the tests. This denial of due process weighs\nheavily against the reinstitution of the 1986 injunction before,\nrather than after, the \"substantial equivalence\" issue is\nresolved.\nSignificantly, the district court, in 1992, made no finding\nthat the WISC-R tests or their Stanford-Binet equivalents are in\nfact useful to the identification of specific learning disabil-\nities. The district court has not written off the possibility\n\n- 26 -\nthat the original plaintiffs may yet introduce new or additional\nevidence showing that IQ tests necessarily distort the identi-\nfication of learning disabilities in black children, and that\nthis has an \"adverse\" effect as serious as the effect of\nmisplacement in EMR classes. When the district court takes up\nthe question of the present status of EMR classes (the\nsubstantial equivalence issue), it will undoubtedly hear more\nabout what effect IQ testing may have on black children.\nNor has the court ordered the resumption of IQ testing for\nanyone, black or white, pending further action by the court. See\nBr. 41-42. The court has simply declared that (1) the 1979 order\ndid not forbid use of those tests for the purposes proposed by\nthe Crawford plaintiffs; (2) the court would not now forbid it on\nthe basis, alone, of its own findings in Larry P.; and (3) had\nthe court been aware of who was affected and how they were\naffected, it would never have entered the 1986 order at all. The\neffect of lifting the 1986 injunction is temporarily to give the\nState the entire responsibility for deciding whether to admin-\nister (or refuse to administer) IQ tests to black children, and\nto risk being faced with an equal protection claim if they refuse\nto do so on the basis of race.\nIII\nTHE CASE IS JUSTICIABLE\nAppellants devote large portions of their brief to arguing\nthat the Crawford plaintiffs presented no justiciable issue, and\nthat the district court held to the contrary without making the\n\n- 27 -\nnecessary subordinate findings (Br. 23-38). One branch of this\nargument is that the Crawford plaintiffs were in fact given the\nforbidden IQ tests, and therefore have no redressable grievance\n(Br. 23-33). The second branch of this contention is that --\nwith or without IQ tests -- the Crawford plaintiffs have been\nassigned to the proper form of special education, and therefore\nthey have no remediable grievance.\nAs amicus, we do not address these issues in detail. It\nwould appear that there are four plaintiff children still in the\ncase: Demond Crawford, Barbara Florence, James Florence, and\nTerence Pina (see dismissals at CR 75). Each of these children\nwas tested for special education during the 1980s, but with one\nexception, they were not given the tests that were on the\n\"forbidden\" list. See Declaration of Devena Reed, CR 52, at 9,\n11, 17, 22. The only one . to receive a WISC-R was James Florence,\nand that was in April 1986, prior to the September 1986\ninjunction. James Florence, moreover, is still of school age\n(see attachment to CR 52 showing Florence to have been born in\n1977) and presumably will need to be retested during his school\ncareer, especially since he is in a special day class (Br. 26).\nMoreover, it is clear that the district court would have\ncertified the subclass had the court not been able to end the\ncase on due process grounds immediately. 10(cid:9)Thus, he is one\n10(cid:9)\nThe district court, when it denied subclass certification,\ncertainly was not influenced by the small number of named\nplaintiffs. Numerosity has nothing to do with it (Br. 40-41).\nThere is no rule that class representatives must be numerous --\nonly that they represent a class too numerous for ordinary joinder.\n\n- 28 -\nplaintiff who apparently had standing when he sued, and as to\nwhom the case is not moot, which the appellants concede (Br. 26,\n31).\nThe argument that no educational harm was shown misses the\npoint. The plaintiffs' standing was based on a claim of having\nsuffered a constitutional injury, i.e., being denied an IQ test\nsolely because of an order that was entered without their being\nheard. 11 A merits question remains to be decided: assuming\nblack children cannot be placed in EMR on the basis of IQ scores,\nis it protective to deny them IQ testing, or is it a deprivation?\nThis merits question has never been decided. Appellants, by\nstating what they believe to be the answer (Br. 27-31), are again\ntaking as decided that which they thought should have been\nsettled in Larry P. but which clearly was not.\n111(cid:9)\nBecause plaintiffs presented a constitutional question,\nthey clearly did not have to exhaust administrative remedies\nassociated with the Education For All Handicapped Children Act.\nIn addition, the form their action took was a Rule 60(b) motion.\nIf one is already a party to a suit and wishes to make a post-\njudgment motion, there are no administrative remedies to exhaust.\n\n- 29 -\nCONCLUSION\nThe judgment below should be affirmed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJAMES P.
