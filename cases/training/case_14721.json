DILWORTH, ET AL., APPELLANTS\nV.\nT. N. RINER, ET AL., APPELLEES\nON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI\nBRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n1. Pleadings and Procedure\nOn September 22, 1964, a complaint was filed\nby 18 Negro citizens (the appellants here) in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District\nof Mississippi. The complaint alleged that appellants\n(1)\n\n- 2 -\n1 /\nand others similarily situated were refused service\nby an employee of Tom's Restaurant and were arrested\nand prosecuted by Dan Adams, Chief of Police, of\nAberdeen, James Harmon, Sheriff and Jessee Lackey,\nDeputy Sheriff of Monroe County, Richard Booth, City\nAttorney of Aberdeen, and George Howell, Judge of the\nMunicipal Court of Aberdeen (the appellees here) when\n2/\nthey failed to leave the restaurant. Appellants fur-\nther alleged that the acts of appellees in refusing to\nserve, arresting, and prosecuting them were violative\nof, inter alia, Title II of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964. A temporary restraining order was sought to\nenjoin appellees from proceeding further with the\ntrial of appellants in the Municipal Court of Aberdeen,\n3/\nwhich trial had been set for hearing on October 7, 1964.\nAppellants also sought to enjoin appellees from con-\ntinuing or maintaining any policy or practice of deny-\ning or interferring with appellants' use and enjoyment\n1 / The complaint was brought as a class action pursuant\nto Rule 23(a)(3), Fed. Rules Civ. Proc.\n2 / T. N. Riner, owner of Tom's Restaurant, is also an\nappellee.\n3 / The United States understands that, by informal\nagreement of the parties, trial of appellants in the\nmunicipal court proceeding has been postponed pending\nthe outcome of the instant proceeding.\n\n-3-\nof Tom's Restaurant and other public accommodations\nin Aberdeen or the punishment of appellants for the\nuse of such facilities, because of their race or color.\nA hearing was held in the District Court on\nOctober 2, 1964, and numerous witnesses were called.\nAt the conclusion of the hearing the court stated that\nthe demand for a temporary restraining order would be\ndenied. An order to this effect was filed on October 5,\n1964. This appeal followed.\n2. The Evidence\nAt the hearing on October 2, five of the\nappellants testified that they had occasion to visit\n4/\nTom's Restaurant on September 5, 1964 (R. 8, 15, 23, 34,\n43, 51). They further testified that upon requesting\nservice, they were told they would have to go around to\nthe back of the restaurant to obtain service (R. 9, 16,\n26, 34, 45).\n4/ Counsel for appellants sought in the court below to\nexamine Mrs. Riner, who is part owner of Tom's Restaurant,\nfor the purpose of showing sufficient involving of the\nrestaurant in commerce to bring it within the terms of\nTitle II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The court, how-\never, excused Mrs. Riner from testifying, ruling that, for\nthe purposes of the application for the temporary restrain-\ning order, it would assume that the restaurant was covered\nby the Civil Rights Act (R. 73-74).\n5/ The restaurant served Negroes in a special area\nreached by passing through a separate door in the back\nof the establishment (R. 9, 18, 26, 34, 44).\n\n-4-\nWhile the Negroes remained seated, the waitress\n6/\nand a middle-aged lady made several telephone calls\n(R. 11, 25, 27, 35). The police arrived and one officer\ntold the waitress to request appellants to leave (R. 11,\n17, 27, 36, 45). She made the request but appellants\nrefused to comply and they were placed under arrest by\nOfficer Newman (R. 11, 17, 28, 36, 46, 53). When asked\nto specify the charges, an officer replied that they\nwere arrested for trespassing and disturbing the peace\n(R. 11, 17, 28, 36, 46). Appellants were then taken to\nthe police station (R. 12, 28, 37, 47).\nMr. Dan Adams, Chief of Police of Aberdeen,\ntestified that he entered the restaurant and informed\nappellant Galloway that the Negroes were under arrest\nfor trespassing and disturbing the peace (R. 53). The\nMayor of Aberdeen, who is also presiding judge of the\nJustice of the Peace Court, testified that the Negroes\n6/ The lady was apparently Mrs. T. N. Riner (R. 27, 36).\n7/ When asked what were the acts that constituted dis-\nturbing the peace, the Chief of Police stated: \"Well,\nthey were pulling the napkins out of the holders on the\ntable and pouring salt and pepper into the napkins, and\nMr. Riner said he wanted them out.\" (R. 54, 55). We\ndo not regard this testimony as having any bearing on\nthe case. Even assuming that the incident, if true, is\nevidence of a true breach of the peace, a suggestion we\nfind difficult to believe, the affidavit of arrest makes\nno mention of the incident or in any way suggests that\nsuch an incident was a basis for the arrests.\n\n-5-\nwho entered the restaurant were charged with refusing\nto leave the premises of Tom's Restaurant after being\nrequested to do so (R. 60). He stated that they were\nnot charged with disturbing the peace (R. 60).\nThe United States has seen the affidavits of\narrest (each of which is identical except for the name\nof defendant) and has reprinted the text of one of them\nas an appendix to this brief. The affidavits charge the\n8/\nNegroes with violating Mississippi Code, Section 2087.5,\n9/\nwhich punishes breach of the peace.\n8 / Another statutory provision recited in the affidavit,\nHouse Bill 960 of the 1964 Legislature provides, inter\nalia, that minors charged with violating section 2087.5\nshall not be tried in the Youth Court.\n9/ Although the affidavit talks of breach of the peace,\nYE describes conduct which is more akin to trespass.\nBut whether the charge be phrased in \"trespass\" or \"breach\nof the peace\" terms, it is clear that the acts for which\nthe Negroes were arrested were entering a restaurant,\nrequesting service, and remaining seated when asked to\nleave. As we demonstrate, infra, pp. 16-19 , this con-\nduct is protected by the Civil ights Act of 1964 and\nthe name attached to it is of no legal significance.\n\n-6-\nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES\nTitle II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nguarantees all citizens equal access to places of public\naccommodation. In the instant case this Court is called\nupon to determine whether section 203(c) of that Title\nauthorizes a federal district court to enjoin state court\nproceedings brought for the purpose of punishing persons\nseeking to enjoy use of public accommodations. Obviously,\nthe 1964 Act will be vitiated if persons exercising\nrights under that Act are subject to arrest and harassment.\nThus, the decision in this case raises basic questions as\nto the effectiveness of the new law.\nThe interest of the United States in the\nimplementation of the 1964 Act is clear. Title II ex-\npressly authorizes the United States to bring suit to\nenforce that Title. Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v.\nUnited States,(cid:9) U.S.(cid:9) (Dec. 14, 1964); Katzenbach v.\nMcClung,(cid:9) U.S.(cid:9) (Dec. 14, 1964); see also United\nStates v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17 (1960). In light of this\nplain and direct interest, and the great public im-\nportance of this case, we believe that it is incumbent\nupon the United States to express its views.\n\n- 7 -\nA D(_11ML`U9'\n1. A preliminary issue before this Court is\nwhether the order of the district court denying the\napplication for a temporary restraining order is ap-\npealable. Appellants argue in their brief that the\norder is appealable under the test announced in United\nStates v. Wood, 295 F. 2d 772 (C.A. 5, 1961). For that\nreason, we will concentrate here on the alternative\nargument that the District Court's order should be\ntreated as one denying an application for a preliminary\ninjunction and that it is for that reason appealable\nunder 28 U.S.C. 1292(a)(1).\n2. The central issue in this case is whether\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorizes a federal court\nto enjoin a state court from proceeding with a criminal\ntrial brought to punish persons who were arrested for\nrequesting service in a restaurant covered by that Act.\nTwo possible obstacles to the issuance of\nsuch an injunction have been suggested.\nThe first is the statutory rule, embodied in 28\nU.S.C. 2283, which prohibits a court of the United States\nfrom granting an injunction to state state court pro-\nceedings except (1) as expressly authorized by Act of\nCongress, (2) where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,\nor (3) to protect its judgments. We will demonstrate,\nby an examination of the language and legislative\n\n-8-\nhistory of Title II, one of the recent Supreme Court\ndecisions construing Title II, and the decisions in-\nM\nterpreting the \"expressly authorized\" language of\nSection 2283, that Title II of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964 is an express authorization within the meaning\nof the first exception to section 2283, to enjoin criminal\nproceedings for acts protected by that Title.\nThe second is the judicially created rule of\nnon-interference with state criminal proceedings which\napplies even where 28 U.S.C. 2283 does not. We will show\nthat the language of Title II expressly exempts this proceed-\ning from the usual rule of non-interference.\n\n- 9 -\nI\nThis Court Has Jurisdiction to Review the\nDenial of Interlocutory Relief Below\n1. The issue necessarily preliminary to all\nother questions is whether the order here complained\nof is appealable. Appellants framed their request\nfor preliminary relief in a prayer for a temporary\nrestraining order to enjoin their further prosecution\nin the Aberdeen Municipal Court. Thereafter, the action\nbelow was referred to as one for a temporary restraining\n10/\norder by the parties and the court.\nCertain interlocutory orders such as those\ngranting or denying preliminary injunctions may be\n11/\nreviewed under 28 U.S.C. 1292(a)Z1). Deckert v.\nIndependence Share Corp., 311 U.S. 282 (1941); Peters\n10/ The order of October 5, 1964, specifically denied\nappellants' prayer for a \"temporary restraining order.\"\n11/ 28 U.S.C. 1292 provides in part:\n(a) The courts of appeals shall have juris-\ndiction of appeals from:\n(1) Interlocutory orders of the district\ncourts of United States * * * granting\ncontinuing, modifying, refusing or\ndissolving injunctions, or refusing\n•(cid:9) to dissolve or modify injunctions,\nexcept where a direct review may be\nhad in the Supreme Court.\n\n- 10 -\nv. Standard Oil Co., 174 F. 2d 162 (C.A. 5, 1949).\nOn the other hand, the denial of a temporary restrain-\ning order is not appealable under that section.  The\nappealability of an order does not, however, depend\nLI\nupon the terminology used by the parties or the court\nbut upon substantive factors bearing upon the real\nnature of the proceeding below. Western Union Tele-\ngraph Co. v. United States & Mexican Trust Co o , 221\nFed. 545, 553 (C.A. 8, 1915); Connell v. Dulien Steel\nProducts, 240 F. 2d 414, 418 (C,A. 5, 1957).\nThe question here, therefore, is not what\nthe proceeding below was labelled, but whether, under\nthe circumstances of the case, the denial of the\n\"temporary restraining order\" was in reality the\ndenial of a preliminary injunction.\n2. A temporary restraining order is\ngenerally issued without notice to the adverse party,\nor, where notice is given, after a hearing which has\na most summary character. See Connell v. Dulien Steel\nProducts, 240 F, 2d 414, 418 (C.A. 5, 1957); Pennsylvania\nR.R. v. Transport Workers Union, 278 F. 2d 693 (C.A. 3,\n1960); 7 Moore, Federal Practice p. 1642-1643. The(cid:9)\nV\npractical reason for not allowing an appeal from such\nan order, other than the fact that it is usually\neffective for only a brief period of time (less than\nthe time normally required for an appeal), is that\n\n- 11 -\nthe trial judge has not had the advantage of a full_\npresentation of the facts and Law before entering an order.\nConnell v. Dulien Steel Products, su ra. At this stage of\nthe case questions of a legal and a factual nature bearing\non whether the lower court would grant a preliminary in-\njunction are usually unanswered. Orderly procedure re-\nquires that -- at least in most circumstances -- the\ntrial judge be permitted to pass on these questions at the\ntime of the more complete hearing for a preliminary injunc-\ntion before his decision is reviewed by a higher court.\nSee Cohen v. Beneficial Loan 0o12., 337 U.S. 541, 546\n12/\n(1949); Connell v. Dulien Steel Products, sujra; (cid:9) Pan\nAmerican World Airlines v. Flight ^h ineers Intl Ass'n,\n306 F. 2d 840, 842-843 (C.A. 2, 1962).\n12/ \nIn Connell this Court found that (240 F. 2d at 418):\nIt is not at all clear that the court\nbelow would actually have granted a\npreliminary injunction, for there are\nseveral legal questions that might well_\nhave been passed on at such a hearing.\nOrderly procedure requires that the trial\ncourt be given the opportunity of passing\non these legal matters at the time of the\nhearing of the motion for preliminary in-\njunction. Also, the plaintiff below should\nbe required at the hearing on preliminary\ninjunction to make out a prima facie case\non the merits in order to obtain in-\njunctive relief.\n\n- 12 -\n(cid:9)\nIt is apparent that these reasons do not U\napply where, as we show infra, there has been adequate\nnotice and a full hearing on the question of whether\nan injunction shall be issued.\na. In Western Union Telegraph Co. v. United\nStates & Mexican Trust Co., 221 Fed. 545 (C.A. 8, 1915),\nthe telegraph company and all other creditors of a\nrailroad line were restrained, after a hearing on\npetition of the trust company, from commencing or\nprosecuting any action against the railroad. On\nappeal, the trust company contended that the orders\nbelow were mere restraining orders and not appealable.\nThe Court of Appeals recognized that a restraining\norder granted without a hearing is not ordinarily\nappealable, but it concluded that (221 Fed. at 553):\n. . . a restraining order which is\ngranted, or sustained, or denied after a\nhearing of the parties, and which is in\neffect and in everything but name, is\na temporary injunction, falls within\nthe evident meaning of the statute\n[Judicial Code §129, now 28 U.S.C.\n1292(a)(1) as amended] and is reviewable\nby appeal * * *•\n\n- 13 -\nIn this Circuit, in Connell v. Dulien Steel\nProducts, supra, the District Court had granted an\norder temporarily restraining appellants from enforcing\na judgment in the Louisiana state courts. While this\nCourt held that the order was not appealable, it\nreached this result for factual reasons. Indeed,\nthe Court explicitly recognized that \"the question of\nappealability should not depend on mere terminology\nbut on whether the order is one within the purview of\n§1292\" (240 F. 2d at 418). The order in Connell was\nissued on the same day as the motion for a \"temporary\nrestraining order\" was filed and after only a most\n13/\nsummary hearing.\n13/ Similarly, in Woods v. Wright, 334 F. 2d 369 (C.A.\n5, 1964), where it was urged that the denial of a\ntemporary restraining order was in fact a refusal to\ngrant a preliminary injunction, this Court implied\nthat because of the summary nature of the proceeding,\nwhat was involved was the denial of a temporary\nrestraining order. The Court ultimately found it\nunnecessary specifically to rule on this point\nsince the order was a final and appealable decision\nunder United States v. Wood, 295 F. 2d 772 (C.A. 5,\n1961). It is to be noted that in Woods v. Wright,\nthe notice itself was inadequate to support a pre-\nliminary injunction since the hearing was held on\nthe same day as the action was filed. Moreover,\nthe hearing at which both parties we're represented\nby counsel was summary in nature, and not a full\nevidentiary hearing as in this case.\n\n- 14 -\nHere the request for a temporary restraining\norder was filed on September 22, 1964, and on September 24,\n1964, a summons was served on each of the appellees. The\nhearing before the District Court was not held until eight(cid:9) t\ndays later. At the hearing all the appellees except T. N.\n14/\nRiney were represented by counsel. Eight witnesses,\nthree of whom were appellees, testified concerning the\nattempts of the Negroes to receive service at the restau-\nrants and the subsequent arrests by the police. Appellees'\ncounsels were given full opportunity to cross-examine\nall witnesses.\nIn short, the proceedings below had all the\nsubstantive characteristics of a hearing on a motion\nfor a preliminary injunction.\nb. The legal issues in this case were decided\nby the District Court in such a way that, of necessity,\nthe resolution of those issues also disposes of any formal\napplication that might be made for a preliminary or perma-\nnent injunction. Judge Clayton held that he was without\nauthority to issue any injunctive relief against the state\ncourt proceedings because of 28 U.S.C. 2283. He stated\nthat (R. 84):\n14/ Mrs. T. N. Riner, wife of one of the appellees,\nstated that she and her husband decided that they did\nnot want counsel (R. 69, 70). Mr. Riner did not testify.\n\n- 15 -\nThere is no part of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964 . . . [which empowers] this\nCourt to . . . enjoin proceedings in State\nCourt contrary to the provisions of 28\nU.S.C. 2283. . . .\nWith the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nmaking no provision by any of its parts\nfor this Court to enjoin proceedings in\nState Court, it is my view that this Court\nis wholly without authority to grant the\nrestraining order. . . .\nThe rationale of that decision requires, of\ncourse, the denial of all relief, whether temporary or\npermanent. It follows that any further hearing in the\n15/\nDistrict Court would be futile. Thus the principal\nreason advanced by this Court in the Connell case for\nnot allowing an appeal from the order therein has no\napplication here. See note 12, supra, p. 11.\nIn short, under any test which considers\nsubstance rather than semantics, the proceeding below\nwas one for a preliminary injunction, and its denial\ntherefore was appealable as such.\n15/ It is, of course, well settled that courts of\nequity will not require the doing of a futile act.\nMontana Nat'l Bank v. Yellowstone County, 276 U.S.\n499, 505 (1928); Orleans Parish School Board v.\nBush, 138 F. Supp. 327 E.D.

No person shall . . .\n(c) punish or attempt to punish any\nperson for exercising or attempting to\nexercise any right or privilege secured\nby section 201 or 202.\nSection 204. (a) Whenever any person\nhas engaged or there are reasonable grounds\nto believe that any person is about to\nengage in any act or practice prohibited by\nsection 203, a civil action for preventive\nrelief, including an application for a perm-\nanent or temporary injunction, restraining\norder, or other order, may be instituted by\nthe person aggrieved and, upon timely appli-\ncation, the court may, in its discretion, permit\nthe Attorney General to intervene in such civil\naction if he certifies that the case is of\ngeneral public importance. . . .\nIn our view, these provisions make clear the\nstatutory purpose to provide for injunctive relief\nagainst anyone who attempts to punish another for\nattempting to exercise his right to equal enjoyment\nof the facilities of an included place of public accom-\nmodation, such as a restaurant. ^\n16/ (continued from preceding page)\nfrom discrimination or segregation of any kind on the\nground of race, color, religion, or national origin, if\nsuch discrimination or segregation is or purports to be\nrequired by any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, rule,\nor order of a State or any agency or political subdivision\nthereof,\" is not relevant to this issue.\n17/ Appellees contend that the acts for which appellants\nwere arrested by state authorities were entirely unrelated\nto their right to the equal enjoyment of the facilities of\nTom's Restaurant. They assert that appellants, having been\n(continued on following page)\n\n- 18 -\n(b) One of the forms of punishment, and no\ndoubt the principal form contemplated by the drafters\nof section 203 (c), was the arrest and prosecution of\nC\npersons seeking access to places of public accommoda-\ntion solely because of their race.\nIt is difficult to understand what section\n203(c) would mean if it did not mean to prohibit arrests\nand prosecutions for using a place or public accommodation.\nActs of private \"punishment\" would as well be covered\nby section 203(b) which prohibits intimidating, threat-\nening, or coercing a person for the purpose of inter-\nfering with rights secured by section 201 or 202.\n17/ (Continued from preceding page)\ndenied service, had laid the predicate for having their\nrights declared by the courts and were required to leave\nthe premises of the restaurant. Their arrest in their\nview, was not for attempting to exercise their right to\nservice, but for the physical occupancy of another's prent\nises. This contention was authoritatively disposed of\nby the Supreme Court decision in Hamm v. City of Rockfill,\nU.S.(cid:9) (Dec. 14, 1964) where it was argued that the\nictims of discrimination are restricted to the statutory\nmechanisms for the redress of any infringement of the\nright to access to a place of public accommodation. In\nsquarely rejecting this contention, the Court declared\n(Slip Opinion, p. 5) :\nAlthough we agree that the law generally\ncondemns self-help, the language of §203(c)\nsupports a conclusion that non-forcible attempts\nto gain admittance to or remain in establishments\ncovered by the Act, are immunized from prosecu-\ntion, for the statute speaks of exercising or\nattempting to exercise a \"right or privilege\"\nsecured by its earlier provisions.\n\n- 19 -\n(c) The legislative history of section 203(c)\nfully supports this conclusion. Senator Humphrey, Floor\nManager of the Act in the Senate, stated that\n[S]ection 203(c) . . . \nprohibits the\nimposition of punishment upon any person\n\"for exercising or attempting to exercise\nany right or privilege\" secured by section\n201 or 202. This plainly means that a\ndefendant in a criminal trespass, breach\nof the peace, or other similar case can\nassert the rights created by 201 and 202\nand that State courts must entertain de-\nfenses grounded upon these provisions.\n(110 Cong. Rec. 9463, daily ed; May 1, 1964)\nThe opponents of the measure had a similar understanding.\nCongressman Harris of Arkansas opposes section 203(c) on\nthe ground that it \"would interfere with the enforcement\nof trespass laws in every State in the Union.\" (110\nCong. Rec. 1843 (daily ed. February 4, 1964)). Likewise,\nSenator Stennis of Mississippi said:\nAs to State judges and State laa enforce-\nment officers, Section 203(c) provides that\n\"no person shall (c) punish or attempt to\npunish any person for exercising or attempting\nto exercise any right or privilege secured by\nSection 201 or 202.\" This is patently an\nattempt to make enforcement by State judges\nand State law enforcement officers of State\nlaws which may later be held to conflict\nwith the act a violation of a federal law\nand to subject them to punitive Federal\naction. (110 Cong. Rec. 6871 (daily ed.\nApril 7, 1964)).\n\n- 20 -\n(d) Any remaining doubt as to the meaning\nof section 203(c) has been removed by the decision of 18/\nthe Supreme Court in Hamm v. City of Rock Hill, supra.—_\nAfter stating that \"The Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids\ndiscrimination in places of public accommodation and\nremoves peaceful attempts to be served on an equal basis\nfrom the category of punishable activities,\" the Court\ncontinued (slip opinion p. 5):\nOn its face, this language prohibits pros-\necution of any person for seeking service\nin a covered establishment because of his\nrace or color, * * * [T]he language of\n§203(c) supports a conclusion that non-\nforcible attempts to gain admittance to\nor remain in establishments covered by the\nAct, are immunized from prosecution, for\nthe statute speaks of exercising or\nattempting to exercise a \"right or privi-\nlege\" secured by its earlier provisions. * *\nIn effect the Act prohibits the application\nof state laws in a way that would deprive\nany person of the rights granted under the\nAct. * * * there can be no question that\nthis was the intended result here in light\nof §203(c).\n18/ Although the court split 5-4 on these decisions,\nthe split was over the question whether the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964 abated convictions of persons who had been\nsentenced on charges of trespass for \"sitting in\" at\nrestaurants prior to passage of the 1964 Act. The Court\nwas not divided on the question of the meaning of\n\"punishment\" in 203(c).\n\n- 21 -\n(e) The Supreme Court in Hamm stated that\nthe language of section 203(c) on its face prohibits\nthe prosecution of anyone for seeking service in a\ncovered establishment because of his race or color.\nPlainly, too, section 204 provides, on its face, that:\nWhenever any person has engaged or there\nare reasonable grounds to believe that any\nperson is about to engage in any act or\npractice prohibited by section 203, a civil\naction for preventive relief, including an\napplication for a permanent or temporary\ninjunction, restraining order, or other\norder, may be instituted by the person\naggrieved . . .\nIn light of this explicit language, there\ncan be no doubt but that Title II expressly authorizes\nUnited States courts to enjoin state court proceedings\nwithin the terms of 28 U.S.C. 2283. Congress could\nhave made its express authorization even more specific\nonly by (1) specifically referring to section 2283 or\n(2) specifically referring to the enjoining of state\ncourts. But neither of these references is necessary\nto meet the \"expressly authorized\" requirements of\nsection 2283.\n\n- 22 -\n2. a. In Amalgamated Clothing Workers of\nAmerica v. Richmond Brothers, 348 U.S. 511 (1955),\nthe Supreme Court considered for the first time the\nlanguage of 28 U.S.C. 2283 which had been enacted in(cid:9) t\n1948 as part of the revised Title 28 of the United\n19/\nStates Code. In holding that the Taft-Hartley Act\ncreated no express exceptions to section 2283 that\nwould permit petitioner to enjoin state proceedings,\nthe Court noted pointedly that an authorization to\nprovide an exemption from the generality of section\n20/\n2283 \"need not expressly refer to §2283.\"\n19/ For a discussion of the history of the predecessor\nof section 2283 and the reasons for its modification,\nsee, in addition to the Amalgamated case, Touce v.\nNew York Life Ins. Co., 314 U.S. 118 (1941); Jacksonville\nBlow Pipe Co. v. Reconstruction Finance Corp., 244\nF. 2d 394 C.A. 5, 1957); and T. Smith & on Inc. v.\nWilliams, 275 F. 2d 397 (C.A. 5, 1960).\n20/ In the Amalgamated case itself, the Court was\nunable to find an express authorization for an ex-\nemption \"within even the most attenuated meaning of\nthe term.\" The provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act, the\nCourt emphasized, gave jurisdiction to the district\ncourts to grant injunctive relief only on behalf of the\nNational Labor Relations Board on petition by it or one\nof its regional attorneys: \"To hold that the Taft-\nHartley Act also authorizes a private litigant to se-\ncure interim relief would be to ignore the closely\ncircumscribed jurisdiction given to the District Court\nand to generalize where Congress has chosen to specify.\"\n348 U.S. at 517. In contrast to the statutory scheme\nin Amal amated case, Congress, by enacting Title II of\nthe Civil Rights Act, specifically authorized private\npersons to secure injunctive relief.\n\n- 23 -\nb. Similarily, the authorizing statute need\nnot refer specifically to the possibility that state\ncourt proceedings might have to be enjoined. This\nCourt recently held in Beal v. Waltz, 309 F. 2d 721\n(C.A. 5, 1962), that 46 U.S.C. 185 expressly authorizes\na federal court to enjoin state court proceedings and\nthat, hence, 28 U.S.C. 2283, does not bar the injunction.\n6\nYet  U.S.C. 185 makes2no reference whatever to en-\nL \njoining state proceedings. In Providence & New York\nSteamship Co. v. Hill Manufacturing Co., 109 U.S. 528\n(1883), the Supreme Court pointed out that Section 185\ndid not refer to enjoining state proceedings but neverthe-\nless concluded: \"Surely [Section 185] applies as well\nto 'claims and proceedings' in state courts as to those\nin the federal courts; . . .\" The Court added that\nany further proceedings by the state courts \"would be\nagainst the express words\" of section 185.\nThe holding of this Court in Beal v. Waltz\napplies with even greater force to Title II of the Civil\nRights Act. Unlike 46 U.S.C. 185, which merely pro-\nvides that \"claims and proceedings . . . shall cease,\"\nTitle II specifically privides in section 204(a) for\nthe granting of injunctions.\n21/ The pertinent portion of this section provides:\n\"Upon compliance with the requirements of this section\nall claims and proceedings against the owner with\nrespect to the matter in question shall cease.\"\n\n- 24 -\nc. There are additional reasons for this\nresult here. Unlike 46 U.S.C. 185 and other statutory\nprovisions which come within the terms of the \"expressly\n22/\nauthorized\" language of section 22$3, the central\nobjective of section 203(c) (in conjunction with\nsection 204(a)) of the Civil Rights Act is to halt\ncourt proceedings brought to punish persons who seek\nto utilize public facilities and are barred from them\nsolely because of their race. And, as we show, supra,\nnot only does the legislative history of section 203(c)\nprove beyond doubt that Congress had such proceedings\nparticularly in mind when it enacted this section, but\nto hold otherwise would be to render section 203(c) of\nthe 1964 Act largely meaningless. Compare Great\nNorthern Railway v. United States, 208 U.S. 452, 465\n(1908); Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U.S. 205, 218 (1910).\nIt is noteworthy in this connection that\nthe Supreme Court in Leiter Minerals, Inc. v. United\nStates, 352 U.S. 220 (1957), the Court ruled that\nsection 2283 had no application where the United States\nwas a party. Invoking the rule of construction that a\nstatute which divests rights that would exist apart\n22/ See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. 1335, 2361 (the interpleader\nstatutes).\n\n- 25 -\nfrom the statute \"will not be applied to the sovereign\nwithout express words to that effect,\" United States v.\nUnited Mine Workers, 330 U.S. 258 (1947), the Court\nstated: \"the frustration of superior federal interests\nthat would ensue from precluding the Federal Government\nfrom obtaining a stay of state court proceedings except\nunder the severe restrictions of 28 U.S.C. 2283 would\nbe so great that we cannot reasonably impute such a\npurpose to Congress from the general language of 28\nU.S.C. 2283 alone.\" 352 U.S. at 226 (emphasis supplied).\nThe doctrine of Leiter Minerals may support the\nproposition that Title II of the 1964 Act is an ex-\nception to the general section 2283 rule.\nIn addition to providing for private suits,\nsection 204(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 allows\nthe Attorney General to intervene in such suits upon\nobtaining the court's permission and certifying they\nare of general public importance. Clearly section\n2283 would have no application if the Attorney General\nintervened. By authorizing the Attorney General to\nintervene, Congress has recognized in Title II actions\nthat \"superior federal interest\" which provides for\nthe section 2283 exception.\n3. a. In support of its conclusion that\nsection 2283 barred any relief, the court below cited\nBaines v. City of Danville, 337 F. 2d 579 (C.A.4, 1964).\n\n- 26 -\nAs the District Court read that decision, it \"held\nthat the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the other\nSections to which you referred, did not provide\nexceptions to the anti-injunction statute [§2283]\nthat we have been talking about.\" (R.85). The\nBaines case had nothing to do with Title II of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964. That case was brought\nunder 42 U.S.C. 1981-1983. The question before the\ncourt was whether the provision of 42 U.S. C. 1983\nauthorizing a \"suit in equity, or other proper pro-\nceeding for redress,\" falls within the statutory\nexception to 28 U.S.C. 2283. This question, which\n23/\nhas elicited conflicting views from the courts\n23/ Holding that the authority to seek injunctive\nrelief under 1983 is not an express authorization\nwithin the terms of section 2283 are Goss v. Illinois,\n312 F. 2d 257 (C.A. 7, 1963); Smith v. Village of\nLansing, 241 D. 2d 856 (C.A. 7, 1957); Sexton v.

The language of\nthe Court's opinion however, clearly demonstrates why\nthe result pertains only to section 1983:\nThe substantive right, in many situa-\ntions, may call for equitable relief,\nand equitable remedies are authorized,\nbut only by a general jurisdictional\ngrant. * * * [T]here is no incom-\npatibility between a generally created\nequity jurisdiction, and particularized\nlimitations which restrict a chancellor's\npower to define the limits of his dis-\ncretion. * * * If every grant of general\nequity jurisdiction created an exception\nto the anti-injunction statute, the\nstatute would be meaningless. [337 F.\n2d at 589]\nUnlike 42 U.S.C. 1983, which concededly is\na broad grant of general equity jurisdiction, section\n203(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a very\nnarrow grant of equity jurisdiction which has specific\napplication only where a person is punished for\nseeking to utilize places of public accommodation.\nThe court in Baines in no way suggested that it would\narrive at the same conclusion should it consider a\nstatute expressly authorizing preventive relief\nagainst courts which seek to punish persons exer-\ncising the right to enjoy the facilities of public\n24/ See e.g., Moore, Federal Practice, Vol. lA,\nU.213[2], p. 2417, Wright Federal Courts, §47, p. 156.\n25/ Chief Judge Sobeloff and Judge Bell dissented on\nthis issue.\n\n- 28 -\naccommodations. In fact, the court's stress on the\neneral equity jurisdiction created by section 1983\nstrongly suggests that it would reach the opposite\nconclusion in the instant case. Plainly, then, the\ndistrict court's reliance on the Baines opinion was\ntotally unwarranted.\nb. The court below also cited three\ndecisions by this Court which, according to Judge\nClayton, \"indicate very strongly\" that this Court\nwould reach here the Baines result:(R. 85-86).\nNone of the cases cited has any bearing\non the issues involved in the instant case.\nPoole v. Barnett, 336 F. 2d 267 (C.A. 5,\n1964), involved a request for an injunction against\nofficers of the State of Mississippi and the City\nof Jackson to restrain them from making further\n26 /\narrests for violations of the malicious trespass\n27/\nand the disturbance of worship laws of the State of\nMississippi. This Court pointed out that the Supreme\nCourt had not ruled that \"state action\" within the\nmeaning of the Fourteenth Amendment was involved\nwhen the police arrest trespassers at the request\nof an owner of property which he holds open to the\n2t Miss. Code, §2406\n27/ Miss. Code, §2090\n\n- 29 -\npublic for some purposes but otherwise maintains on a\nsegregated basis. The Court ruled that in \"this state\nof the law, we cannot hold that the trial court erred\nin denying the preliminary injunction.\" The question\nof the applicability of 28 U.S.C. 2283 never entered\nthe case.\nThe other two decisions cited, Brown v.\nW.A. \nRayfield, 320 F. 2d 96  5, 1963) and In Re Wykoff,\n6 Race Relations Law Reporter 793 (unreported), are\nhabeas corpus cases. The Court there held that\npersons who concededly had failed to exhaust their\nstate remedies as required by 28 U.S.C. 2254 did not\nmake a sufficient showing of an absence of an available\nstate remedy or the existence of circumstances\nrendering such remedy ineffective to protect their\nrights. Hence the exception to 28 U.S.C. 2254 was\nnot applicable and this Court dismissed the appeals.\nAgain, there was no reference to section 2283.\n\n- 30 -\nIII\nThe Injunction Requested in This\nCase is Tot arre y Rulesof\n_-- -----\nomITy\nThe general rule of non-interference by federal\n1\ncourts with state criminal proceedings was set forth by\nthe Supreme Court in Douglas v. Cif of- Jeannette, 319 U.S.\n157 (1943) , as follows:\nCongress, by its legislation, has\nadopted the policy, with certain well\ndefined statutory exceptions, of leaving\ngenerally to the state courts the trial\nof criminal cases arising under state laws,\nsubject to review by this Court of any\nfederal questions involved. Hence, courts\nof equity in the exercise\nof their discretionary powers should con-\nform to this policy by refusing to inter-\nfere with or embarrass threatened proceed-\nings in state courts save in those excep-\ntional cases which call for the inter-\nposition of a court of equity to prevent\nirreparable injury which is clear and\nimminent28/ ...\nUnderlying the principle of comity between state\nand federal courts is the notion that, since the decision of\nthe state court: is \nsubject to ultimate review by the Supreme\nCourt, the state judicial system should be permitted to\ncomplete its function undisturbed by premature interference\n7y the federal courts. Spielman Motor Sales  Co. v. Dodge,\n295 U.S. 89, 95-96 (1935); Fenner v. skin, 271 U.S. 240,\n244 (1926) .\n28/ C. F. Cleary v. Boyler, 371 U.S.'397 (19b3); Wilson v.\nnettler, 365 U.S. 381 (1961); Stefanelli v. Minardi 342\nU.S. 117 21951); Ponzi v. Fessenden, 258 U.S. 254+ (l922).\n\n- 31 -\nBut, as this Court stated in United States v.\nWood, 295 F. 2d 772, 779 (C.A. 5, 1961), \"the policy\nagainst interference with state criminal proceedings . . .\nis not one of statutory derivation.\" It is simply a rule\nof comity, \"not a rule distributing power as between the\nState and federal courts,\"(cid:9) v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391,\n425 (1963), and may at any time be abrogated by Congress.\nThis is precisely what was done when Congress enacted\nTitle II of the Civil Rights Act. Section 207(a) of the\n1964 Act provides:\nThe district courts of the United\nStates shall have jurisdiction of pro-\nceedings instituted pursuant to this\ntitle and shall exercise the same with-\nout regard to whether the aggrieved\nparty shall have exhausted any admini-\nstrative of other remedies that may be\nprovided by law.\nThis provision plainly and unambiguously removes\nTitle II cases from the ambit of the comity rule (for\nobvious reasons similar to those discussed in the preceding\nportion of this brief, su ra at pp. 16-19 ) .\nAny doubt that section 207(a) creates an exception\nto the rule of non-interference discussed in Jeannette\nwas removed by the decision of this Court in United States\nv. Wood, 295 F.2d 772 (C.A. 5, 1961). That case involved\na suit which, like the instant one, was brought to enjoin\n\n- 32 -\na pending criminal prosecution. The Wood opinion con-\nstrued section 131(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1957\n(42 U.S.C. 1971(d) which is virtually identical to\n29/\nsection 207(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as follows:\nThe court in this action is not\noperating under common-law equitable\nand discretionary doctrines, but under\na mandatory jurisdictional statute. As\nalready pointed out, the district court\nconsidered that it had jurisdiction over\nthis action but that such jurisdiction\nshould not be exercised to the extent of\nissuing the temporary restraining order.\nUnder the applicable jurisdictional sec-\ntion, we do not believe the court had\nthat choice.\nAfter quoting 42 U.S.C. 1971(d) the court continued\nFor several reasons, we hold that\nthis theory [ of non-interference with\nstate criminal proceedings set forth\nin Jeanette] is not applicable to the\npresent case.\nFirst, section 1971 creates a cause\nof action in the United States for\n\"preventive relief\" where a person has\nintimidated or has attempted to intimidate\nanother in the exercise of his right to\nvote. Where a federal statute has specif i-\ncally created a cause of action for_ preven-\ntive relief for intimidation, it may no\nlonger be said that this intimidation will\nnot be judicially recognized for the pur-\npose of establishing an equitable cause of\naction.\n29/ The statutes differ in two respects: (1) the 1957 Act\nstates: \"pursuant to this section\" while the 1964 Act states:\n\"pursuant to this title\";(2) where the 1957 Act speaks of the\n\"party aggrieved,\" the 1964 statute speaks of the \"aggrieved\nparty.\"\n\n- 33 -\nSecond, we believe that the affirma-\ntive defense of adequate state remedies\nhas been specifically removed by statute,\nfor subsection (d) expressly states that\nthe district court is to exercise juris-\ndiction without regard to whether the ag-\ngrieved party shall have exhausted other\nremedies provided by law. With this de-\nfense removed, there are no longer any\ngrounds for judicially ignoring that in-\ntimidation may exist in fact or that\nirreparable injury is not present.\nThe Wood opinion concluded by pointing out that\nits interpretation of section 1971(c) was \"in line with the\ndoctrine in other federal cases in this Circuit dealing\nwith the deprivation of constitutional rights on the basis\nof race or color.\" The Court noted that in Morrison v.\n30/\nDavis, 252 F. 2d 102 (C.A. 5, 1958), ! an injunctive action\n30/ In Morrison, this Court stated:\nWhatever may be the rule as to other threatened\nprosecutions, the Supreme Court in a case pre-\nsenting an identical factual issue affirmed the\njudgment of the trial court in the Browder case\n[Browder v. die, D.C.M. D. Ala., 1 1+ 2F. Supp.\n707, affirmed 1956, 352 U.S. 903] in which the\nsame contention was advanced. To the extent\nthat this is inconsistent with DouLlas v. City\nof Jeannett, Pa., 319 U.S. 157, 63 S.Ct. 877,\n87 L.Ed. 1324, we must consider the earlier\ncase modified.\nSee also Aelony v. Pace, No. 530 (M.D. Ga., Nov. 1, 1963)\n(unreported)) where Chief Judge Tuttle, writing for a three-\njudge court, granted an injunction forbidding prosecution of\nplaintiffs under Georgia insurrection and unlawful assembly\nstatutes: Anderson v. City of Albany, 321 F. 2d 649\n(C.A. 5, 1963); Bailey v. Patterson, 323 F. 2d 201\n(C.A. 5, 1963), cert. denied, 37^U.S. 910 (1964).\n\n-34-\n1\nbrought pursuant to 42 U.S.0  1983. Douglas v. Jeannette\nwas held to be inapplicable.\nIn short, Wood plainly holds that Jeannette is\ninapplicable to injunctive proceedings brought under a\n21\nmandatory jurisdictional statute such as 42  S.C. 1971\nor Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.If\n31/ It may also be said that, at least, in this Circuit,\nit is the rule that the Jeannette case is to be given \"a\nnarrow reading in civil rights cases,\" Dombrowski v. Pfister,\n227 F. Supp. 556, 583 (dissenting opinion of Judge Wisdom),\njurisd. noted, 377 U.S. 976 (1964).\n3?/ In cases analogous to the instant proceeding the equity\npowers of federal courts have also been invoked to entertain\na bill of peace to enjoin proceedings brought in state courts\nsolely for purposes of harassment. See Americ an Optometric\nAss'n v. Ritholz, 101 F 2d 883 (C.A. 7, 1939); Jamerson v.\nALli nce Ins. Co. of Philadelphia, 87 F. 2d 253 C.A. 7, 1937)\nwhich affirmed district court proceedings and held that the\npredecessor of 28 U.S.C. 2283 did not bar such relief. See\nalso Woodmen of the World v. O'Neil, 266 U.S. 292 (1924).\nProf essor Moore, in his \"Commentary on the U.S. Judicial\nCode,\" states that 28 U.S.C. 2283 permits such injunctive\nproceedings.\n\n- 35 -\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, it is suggested that\nthe order of the District Court be reversed.\nBURKE MARSHALL\nAssistant Attorney General,\nH.

DILWORTH, ET AL., APPELLANTS\nV.\nT. N. RINER, ET AL., APPELLEES\nON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI\nBRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n1. Pleadings and Procedure\nOn September 22, 1964, a complaint was filed\nby 18 Negro citizens (the appellants here) in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District\nof Mississippi. The complaint alleged that appellants\n(1)\n\n- 2 -\n1 /\nand others similarily situated were refused service\nby an employee of Tom's Restaurant and were arrested\nand prosecuted by Dan Adams, Chief of Police, of\nAberdeen, James Harmon, Sheriff and Jessee Lackey,\nDeputy Sheriff of Monroe County, Richard Booth, City\nAttorney of Aberdeen, and George Howell, Judge of the\nMunicipal Court of Aberdeen (the appellees here) when\n2/\nthey failed to leave the restaurant. Appellants fur-\nther alleged that the acts of appellees in refusing to\nserve, arresting, and prosecuting them were violative\nof, inter alia, Title II of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964. A temporary restraining order was sought to\nenjoin appellees from proceeding further with the\ntrial of appellants in the Municipal Court of Aberdeen,\n3/\nwhich trial had been set for hearing on October 7, 1964.\nAppellants also sought to enjoin appellees from con-\ntinuing or maintaining any policy or practice of deny-\ning or interferring with appellants' use and enjoyment\n1 / The complaint was brought as a class action pursuant\nto Rule 23(a)(3), Fed. Rules Civ. Proc.\n2 / T. N. Riner, owner of Tom's Restaurant, is also an\nappellee.\n3 / The United States understands that, by informal\nagreement of the parties, trial of appellants in the\nmunicipal court proceeding has been postponed pending\nthe outcome of the instant proceeding.\n\n-3-\nof Tom's Restaurant and other public accommodations\nin Aberdeen or the punishment of appellants for the\nuse of such facilities, because of their race or color.\nA hearing was held in the District Court on\nOctober 2, 1964, and numerous witnesses were called.\nAt the conclusion of the hearing the court stated that\nthe demand for a temporary restraining order would be\ndenied. An order to this effect was filed on October 5,\n1964. This appeal followed.\n2. The Evidence\nAt the hearing on October 2, five of the\nappellants testified that they had occasion to visit\n4/\nTom's Restaurant on September 5, 1964 (R. 8, 15, 23, 34,\n43, 51). They further testified that upon requesting\nservice, they were told they would have to go around to\nthe back of the restaurant to obtain service (R. 9, 16,\n26, 34, 45).\n4/ Counsel for appellants sought in the court below to\nexamine Mrs. Riner, who is part owner of Tom's Restaurant,\nfor the purpose of showing sufficient involving of the\nrestaurant in commerce to bring it within the terms of\nTitle II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The court, how-\never, excused Mrs. Riner from testifying, ruling that, for\nthe purposes of the application for the temporary restrain-\ning order, it would assume that the restaurant was covered\nby the Civil Rights Act (R. 73-74).\n5/ The restaurant served Negroes in a special area\nreached by passing through a separate door in the back\nof the establishment (R. 9, 18, 26, 34, 44).\n\n-4-\nWhile the Negroes remained seated, the waitress\n6/\nand a middle-aged lady made several telephone calls\n(R. 11, 25, 27, 35). The police arrived and one officer\ntold the waitress to request appellants to leave (R. 11,\n17, 27, 36, 45). She made the request but appellants\nrefused to comply and they were placed under arrest by\nOfficer Newman (R. 11, 17, 28, 36, 46, 53). When asked\nto specify the charges, an officer replied that they\nwere arrested for trespassing and disturbing the peace\n(R. 11, 17, 28, 36, 46). Appellants were then taken to\nthe police station (R. 12, 28, 37, 47).\nMr. Dan Adams, Chief of Police of Aberdeen,\ntestified that he entered the restaurant and informed\nappellant Galloway that the Negroes were under arrest\nfor trespassing and disturbing the peace (R. 53). The\nMayor of Aberdeen, who is also presiding judge of the\nJustice of the Peace Court, testified that the Negroes\n6/ The lady was apparently Mrs. T. N. Riner (R. 27, 36).\n7/ When asked what were the acts that constituted dis-\nturbing the peace, the Chief of Police stated: \"Well,\nthey were pulling the napkins out of the holders on the\ntable and pouring salt and pepper into the napkins, and\nMr. Riner said he wanted them out.\" (R. 54, 55). We\ndo not regard this testimony as having any bearing on\nthe case. Even assuming that the incident, if true, is\nevidence of a true breach of the peace, a suggestion we\nfind difficult to believe, the affidavit of arrest makes\nno mention of the incident or in any way suggests that\nsuch an incident was a basis for the arrests.\n\n-5-\nwho entered the restaurant were charged with refusing\nto leave the premises of Tom's Restaurant after being\nrequested to do so (R. 60). He stated that they were\nnot charged with disturbing the peace (R. 60).\nThe United States has seen the affidavits of\narrest (each of which is identical except for the name\nof defendant) and has reprinted the text of one of them\nas an appendix to this brief. The affidavits charge the\n8/\nNegroes with violating Mississippi Code, Section 2087.5,\n9/\nwhich punishes breach of the peace.\n8 / Another statutory provision recited in the affidavit,\nHouse Bill 960 of the 1964 Legislature provides, inter\nalia, that minors charged with violating section 2087.5\nshall not be tried in the Youth Court.\n9/ Although the affidavit talks of breach of the peace,\nYE describes conduct which is more akin to trespass.\nBut whether the charge be phrased in \"trespass\" or \"breach\nof the peace\" terms, it is clear that the acts for which\nthe Negroes were arrested were entering a restaurant,\nrequesting service, and remaining seated when asked to\nleave. As we demonstrate, infra, pp. 16-19 , this con-\nduct is protected by the Civil ights Act of 1964 and\nthe name attached to it is of no legal significance.\n\n-6-\nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES\nTitle II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nguarantees all citizens equal access to places of public\naccommodation. In the instant case this Court is called\nupon to determine whether section 203(c) of that Title\nauthorizes a federal district court to enjoin state court\nproceedings brought for the purpose of punishing persons\nseeking to enjoy use of public accommodations. Obviously,\nthe 1964 Act will be vitiated if persons exercising\nrights under that Act are subject to arrest and harassment.\nThus, the decision in this case raises basic questions as\nto the effectiveness of the new law.\nThe interest of the United States in the\nimplementation of the 1964 Act is clear. Title II ex-\npressly authorizes the United States to bring suit to\nenforce that Title. Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v.\nUnited States,(cid:9) U.S.(cid:9) (Dec. 14, 1964); Katzenbach v.\nMcClung,(cid:9) U.S.(cid:9) (Dec. 14, 1964); see also United\nStates v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17 (1960). In light of this\nplain and direct interest, and the great public im-\nportance of this case, we believe that it is incumbent\nupon the United States to express its views.\n\n- 7 -\nA D(_11ML`U9'\n1. A preliminary issue before this Court is\nwhether the order of the district court denying the\napplication for a temporary restraining order is ap-\npealable. Appellants argue in their brief that the\norder is appealable under the test announced in United\nStates v. Wood, 295 F. 2d 772 (C.A. 5, 1961). For that\nreason, we will concentrate here on the alternative\nargument that the District Court's order should be\ntreated as one denying an application for a preliminary\ninjunction and that it is for that reason appealable\nunder 28 U.S.C. 1292(a)(1).\n2. The central issue in this case is whether\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorizes a federal court\nto enjoin a state court from proceeding with a criminal\ntrial brought to punish persons who were arrested for\nrequesting service in a restaurant covered by that Act.\nTwo possible obstacles to the issuance of\nsuch an injunction have been suggested.\nThe first is the statutory rule, embodied in 28\nU.S.C. 2283, which prohibits a court of the United States\nfrom granting an injunction to state state court pro-\nceedings except (1) as expressly authorized by Act of\nCongress, (2) where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,\nor (3) to protect its judgments. We will demonstrate,\nby an examination of the language and legislative\n\n-8-\nhistory of Title II, one of the recent Supreme Court\ndecisions construing Title II, and the decisions in-\nM\nterpreting the \"expressly authorized\" language of\nSection 2283, that Title II of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964 is an express authorization within the meaning\nof the first exception to section 2283, to enjoin criminal\nproceedings for acts protected by that Title.\nThe second is the judicially created rule of\nnon-interference with state criminal proceedings which\napplies even where 28 U.S.C. 2283 does not. We will show\nthat the language of Title II expressly exempts this proceed-\ning from the usual rule of non-interference.\n\n- 9 -\nI\nThis Court Has Jurisdiction to Review the\nDenial of Interlocutory Relief Below\n1. The issue necessarily preliminary to all\nother questions is whether the order here complained\nof is appealable. Appellants framed their request\nfor preliminary relief in a prayer for a temporary\nrestraining order to enjoin their further prosecution\nin the Aberdeen Municipal Court. Thereafter, the action\nbelow was referred to as one for a temporary restraining\n10/\norder by the parties and the court.\nCertain interlocutory orders such as those\ngranting or denying preliminary injunctions may be\n11/\nreviewed under 28 U.S.C. 1292(a)Z1). Deckert v.\nIndependence Share Corp., 311 U.S. 282 (1941); Peters\n10/ The order of October 5, 1964, specifically denied\nappellants' prayer for a \"temporary restraining order.\"\n11/ 28 U.S.C. 1292 provides in part:\n(a) The courts of appeals shall have juris-\ndiction of appeals from:\n(1) Interlocutory orders of the district\ncourts of United States * * * granting\ncontinuing, modifying, refusing or\ndissolving injunctions, or refusing\n•(cid:9) to dissolve or modify injunctions,\nexcept where a direct review may be\nhad in the Supreme Court.\n\n- 10 -\nv. Standard Oil Co., 174 F. 2d 162 (C.A. 5, 1949).\nOn the other hand, the denial of a temporary restrain-\ning order is not appealable under that section.  The\nappealability of an order does not, however, depend\nLI\nupon the terminology used by the parties or the court\nbut upon substantive factors bearing upon the real\nnature of the proceeding below. Western Union Tele-\ngraph Co. v. United States & Mexican Trust Co o , 221\nFed. 545, 553 (C.A. 8, 1915); Connell v. Dulien Steel\nProducts, 240 F. 2d 414, 418 (C,A. 5, 1957).\nThe question here, therefore, is not what\nthe proceeding below was labelled, but whether, under\nthe circumstances of the case, the denial of the\n\"temporary restraining order\" was in reality the\ndenial of a preliminary injunction.\n2. A temporary restraining order is\ngenerally issued without notice to the adverse party,\nor, where notice is given, after a hearing which has\na most summary character. See Connell v. Dulien Steel\nProducts, 240 F, 2d 414, 418 (C.A. 5, 1957); Pennsylvania\nR.R. v. Transport Workers Union, 278 F. 2d 693 (C.A. 3,\n1960); 7 Moore, Federal Practice p. 1642-1643. The(cid:9)\nV\npractical reason for not allowing an appeal from such\nan order, other than the fact that it is usually\neffective for only a brief period of time (less than\nthe time normally required for an appeal), is that\n\n- 11 -\nthe trial judge has not had the advantage of a full_\npresentation of the facts and Law before entering an order.\nConnell v. Dulien Steel Products, su ra. At this stage of\nthe case questions of a legal and a factual nature bearing\non whether the lower court would grant a preliminary in-\njunction are usually unanswered. Orderly procedure re-\nquires that -- at least in most circumstances -- the\ntrial judge be permitted to pass on these questions at the\ntime of the more complete hearing for a preliminary injunc-\ntion before his decision is reviewed by a higher court.\nSee Cohen v. Beneficial Loan 0o12., 337 U.S. 541, 546\n12/\n(1949); Connell v. Dulien Steel Products, sujra; (cid:9) Pan\nAmerican World Airlines v. Flight ^h ineers Intl Ass'n,\n306 F. 2d 840, 842-843 (C.A. 2, 1962).\n12/ \nIn Connell this Court found that (240 F. 2d at 418):\nIt is not at all clear that the court\nbelow would actually have granted a\npreliminary injunction, for there are\nseveral legal questions that might well_\nhave been passed on at such a hearing.\nOrderly procedure requires that the trial\ncourt be given the opportunity of passing\non these legal matters at the time of the\nhearing of the motion for preliminary in-\njunction. Also, the plaintiff below should\nbe required at the hearing on preliminary\ninjunction to make out a prima facie case\non the merits in order to obtain in-\njunctive relief.\n\n- 12 -\n(cid:9)\nIt is apparent that these reasons do not U\napply where, as we show infra, there has been adequate\nnotice and a full hearing on the question of whether\nan injunction shall be issued.\na. In Western Union Telegraph Co. v. United\nStates & Mexican Trust Co., 221 Fed. 545 (C.A. 8, 1915),\nthe telegraph company and all other creditors of a\nrailroad line were restrained, after a hearing on\npetition of the trust company, from commencing or\nprosecuting any action against the railroad. On\nappeal, the trust company contended that the orders\nbelow were mere restraining orders and not appealable.\nThe Court of Appeals recognized that a restraining\norder granted without a hearing is not ordinarily\nappealable, but it concluded that (221 Fed. at 553):\n. . . a restraining order which is\ngranted, or sustained, or denied after a\nhearing of the parties, and which is in\neffect and in everything but name, is\na temporary injunction, falls within\nthe evident meaning of the statute\n[Judicial Code §129, now 28 U.S.C.\n1292(a)(1) as amended] and is reviewable\nby appeal * * *•\n\n- 13 -\nIn this Circuit, in Connell v. Dulien Steel\nProducts, supra, the District Court had granted an\norder temporarily restraining appellants from enforcing\na judgment in the Louisiana state courts. While this\nCourt held that the order was not appealable, it\nreached this result for factual reasons. Indeed,\nthe Court explicitly recognized that \"the question of\nappealability should not depend on mere terminology\nbut on whether the order is one within the purview of\n§1292\" (240 F. 2d at 418). The order in Connell was\nissued on the same day as the motion for a \"temporary\nrestraining order\" was filed and after only a most\n13/\nsummary hearing.\n13/ Similarly, in Woods v. Wright, 334 F. 2d 369 (C.A.\n5, 1964), where it was urged that the denial of a\ntemporary restraining order was in fact a refusal to\ngrant a preliminary injunction, this Court implied\nthat because of the summary nature of the proceeding,\nwhat was involved was the denial of a temporary\nrestraining order. The Court ultimately found it\nunnecessary specifically to rule on this point\nsince the order was a final and appealable decision\nunder United States v. Wood, 295 F. 2d 772 (C.A. 5,\n1961). It is to be noted that in Woods v. Wright,\nthe notice itself was inadequate to support a pre-\nliminary injunction since the hearing was held on\nthe same day as the action was filed. Moreover,\nthe hearing at which both parties we're represented\nby counsel was summary in nature, and not a full\nevidentiary hearing as in this case.\n\n- 14 -\nHere the request for a temporary restraining\norder was filed on September 22, 1964, and on September 24,\n1964, a summons was served on each of the appellees. The\nhearing before the District Court was not held until eight(cid:9) t\ndays later. At the hearing all the appellees except T. N.\n14/\nRiney were represented by counsel. Eight witnesses,\nthree of whom were appellees, testified concerning the\nattempts of the Negroes to receive service at the restau-\nrants and the subsequent arrests by the police. Appellees'\ncounsels were given full opportunity to cross-examine\nall witnesses.\nIn short, the proceedings below had all the\nsubstantive characteristics of a hearing on a motion\nfor a preliminary injunction.\nb. The legal issues in this case were decided\nby the District Court in such a way that, of necessity,\nthe resolution of those issues also disposes of any formal\napplication that might be made for a preliminary or perma-\nnent injunction. Judge Clayton held that he was without\nauthority to issue any injunctive relief against the state\ncourt proceedings because of 28 U.S.C. 2283. He stated\nthat (R. 84):\n14/ Mrs. T. N. Riner, wife of one of the appellees,\nstated that she and her husband decided that they did\nnot want counsel (R. 69, 70). Mr. Riner did not testify.\n\n- 15 -\nThere is no part of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964 . . . [which empowers] this\nCourt to . . . enjoin proceedings in State\nCourt contrary to the provisions of 28\nU.S.C. 2283. . . .\nWith the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nmaking no provision by any of its parts\nfor this Court to enjoin proceedings in\nState Court, it is my view that this Court\nis wholly without authority to grant the\nrestraining order. . . .\nThe rationale of that decision requires, of\ncourse, the denial of all relief, whether temporary or\npermanent. It follows that any further hearing in the\n15/\nDistrict Court would be futile. Thus the principal\nreason advanced by this Court in the Connell case for\nnot allowing an appeal from the order therein has no\napplication here. See note 12, supra, p. 11.\nIn short, under any test which considers\nsubstance rather than semantics, the proceeding below\nwas one for a preliminary injunction, and its denial\ntherefore was appealable as such.\n15/ It is, of course, well settled that courts of\nequity will not require the doing of a futile act.\nMontana Nat'l Bank v. Yellowstone County, 276 U.S.\n499, 505 (1928); Orleans Parish School Board v.\nBush, 138 F. Supp. 327 E.D.

No person shall . . .\n(c) punish or attempt to punish any\nperson for exercising or attempting to\nexercise any right or privilege secured\nby section 201 or 202.\nSection 204. (a) Whenever any person\nhas engaged or there are reasonable grounds\nto believe that any person is about to\nengage in any act or practice prohibited by\nsection 203, a civil action for preventive\nrelief, including an application for a perm-\nanent or temporary injunction, restraining\norder, or other order, may be instituted by\nthe person aggrieved and, upon timely appli-\ncation, the court may, in its discretion, permit\nthe Attorney General to intervene in such civil\naction if he certifies that the case is of\ngeneral public importance. . . .\nIn our view, these provisions make clear the\nstatutory purpose to provide for injunctive relief\nagainst anyone who attempts to punish another for\nattempting to exercise his right to equal enjoyment\nof the facilities of an included place of public accom-\nmodation, such as a restaurant. ^\n16/ (continued from preceding page)\nfrom discrimination or segregation of any kind on the\nground of race, color, religion, or national origin, if\nsuch discrimination or segregation is or purports to be\nrequired by any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, rule,\nor order of a State or any agency or political subdivision\nthereof,\" is not relevant to this issue.\n17/ Appellees contend that the acts for which appellants\nwere arrested by state authorities were entirely unrelated\nto their right to the equal enjoyment of the facilities of\nTom's Restaurant. They assert that appellants, having been\n(continued on following page)\n\n- 18 -\n(b) One of the forms of punishment, and no\ndoubt the principal form contemplated by the drafters\nof section 203 (c), was the arrest and prosecution of\nC\npersons seeking access to places of public accommoda-\ntion solely because of their race.\nIt is difficult to understand what section\n203(c) would mean if it did not mean to prohibit arrests\nand prosecutions for using a place or public accommodation.\nActs of private \"punishment\" would as well be covered\nby section 203(b) which prohibits intimidating, threat-\nening, or coercing a person for the purpose of inter-\nfering with rights secured by section 201 or 202.\n17/ (Continued from preceding page)\ndenied service, had laid the predicate for having their\nrights declared by the courts and were required to leave\nthe premises of the restaurant. Their arrest in their\nview, was not for attempting to exercise their right to\nservice, but for the physical occupancy of another's prent\nises. This contention was authoritatively disposed of\nby the Supreme Court decision in Hamm v. City of Rockfill,\nU.S.(cid:9) (Dec. 14, 1964) where it was argued that the\nictims of discrimination are restricted to the statutory\nmechanisms for the redress of any infringement of the\nright to access to a place of public accommodation. In\nsquarely rejecting this contention, the Court declared\n(Slip Opinion, p. 5) :\nAlthough we agree that the law generally\ncondemns self-help, the language of §203(c)\nsupports a conclusion that non-forcible attempts\nto gain admittance to or remain in establishments\ncovered by the Act, are immunized from prosecu-\ntion, for the statute speaks of exercising or\nattempting to exercise a \"right or privilege\"\nsecured by its earlier provisions.\n\n- 19 -\n(c) The legislative history of section 203(c)\nfully supports this conclusion. Senator Humphrey, Floor\nManager of the Act in the Senate, stated that\n[S]ection 203(c) . . . \nprohibits the\nimposition of punishment upon any person\n\"for exercising or attempting to exercise\nany right or privilege\" secured by section\n201 or 202. This plainly means that a\ndefendant in a criminal trespass, breach\nof the peace, or other similar case can\nassert the rights created by 201 and 202\nand that State courts must entertain de-\nfenses grounded upon these provisions.\n(110 Cong. Rec. 9463, daily ed; May 1, 1964)\nThe opponents of the measure had a similar understanding.\nCongressman Harris of Arkansas opposes section 203(c) on\nthe ground that it \"would interfere with the enforcement\nof trespass laws in every State in the Union.\" (110\nCong. Rec. 1843 (daily ed. February 4, 1964)). Likewise,\nSenator Stennis of Mississippi said:\nAs to State judges and State laa enforce-\nment officers, Section 203(c) provides that\n\"no person shall (c) punish or attempt to\npunish any person for exercising or attempting\nto exercise any right or privilege secured by\nSection 201 or 202.\" This is patently an\nattempt to make enforcement by State judges\nand State law enforcement officers of State\nlaws which may later be held to conflict\nwith the act a violation of a federal law\nand to subject them to punitive Federal\naction. (110 Cong. Rec. 6871 (daily ed.\nApril 7, 1964)).\n\n- 20 -\n(d) Any remaining doubt as to the meaning\nof section 203(c) has been removed by the decision of 18/\nthe Supreme Court in Hamm v. City of Rock Hill, supra.—_\nAfter stating that \"The Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids\ndiscrimination in places of public accommodation and\nremoves peaceful attempts to be served on an equal basis\nfrom the category of punishable activities,\" the Court\ncontinued (slip opinion p. 5):\nOn its face, this language prohibits pros-\necution of any person for seeking service\nin a covered establishment because of his\nrace or color, * * * [T]he language of\n§203(c) supports a conclusion that non-\nforcible attempts to gain admittance to\nor remain in establishments covered by the\nAct, are immunized from prosecution, for\nthe statute speaks of exercising or\nattempting to exercise a \"right or privi-\nlege\" secured by its earlier provisions. * *\nIn effect the Act prohibits the application\nof state laws in a way that would deprive\nany person of the rights granted under the\nAct. * * * there can be no question that\nthis was the intended result here in light\nof §203(c).\n18/ Although the court split 5-4 on these decisions,\nthe split was over the question whether the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964 abated convictions of persons who had been\nsentenced on charges of trespass for \"sitting in\" at\nrestaurants prior to passage of the 1964 Act. The Court\nwas not divided on the question of the meaning of\n\"punishment\" in 203(c).\n\n- 21 -\n(e) The Supreme Court in Hamm stated that\nthe language of section 203(c) on its face prohibits\nthe prosecution of anyone for seeking service in a\ncovered establishment because of his race or color.\nPlainly, too, section 204 provides, on its face, that:\nWhenever any person has engaged or there\nare reasonable grounds to believe that any\nperson is about to engage in any act or\npractice prohibited by section 203, a civil\naction for preventive relief, including an\napplication for a permanent or temporary\ninjunction, restraining order, or other\norder, may be instituted by the person\naggrieved . . .\nIn light of this explicit language, there\ncan be no doubt but that Title II expressly authorizes\nUnited States courts to enjoin state court proceedings\nwithin the terms of 28 U.S.C. 2283. Congress could\nhave made its express authorization even more specific\nonly by (1) specifically referring to section 2283 or\n(2) specifically referring to the enjoining of state\ncourts. But neither of these references is necessary\nto meet the \"expressly authorized\" requirements of\nsection 2283.\n\n- 22 -\n2. a. In Amalgamated Clothing Workers of\nAmerica v. Richmond Brothers, 348 U.S. 511 (1955),\nthe Supreme Court considered for the first time the\nlanguage of 28 U.S.C. 2283 which had been enacted in(cid:9) t\n1948 as part of the revised Title 28 of the United\n19/\nStates Code. In holding that the Taft-Hartley Act\ncreated no express exceptions to section 2283 that\nwould permit petitioner to enjoin state proceedings,\nthe Court noted pointedly that an authorization to\nprovide an exemption from the generality of section\n20/\n2283 \"need not expressly refer to §2283.\"\n19/ For a discussion of the history of the predecessor\nof section 2283 and the reasons for its modification,\nsee, in addition to the Amalgamated case, Touce v.\nNew York Life Ins. Co., 314 U.S. 118 (1941); Jacksonville\nBlow Pipe Co. v. Reconstruction Finance Corp., 244\nF. 2d 394 C.A. 5, 1957); and T. Smith & on Inc. v.\nWilliams, 275 F. 2d 397 (C.A. 5, 1960).\n20/ In the Amalgamated case itself, the Court was\nunable to find an express authorization for an ex-\nemption \"within even the most attenuated meaning of\nthe term.\" The provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act, the\nCourt emphasized, gave jurisdiction to the district\ncourts to grant injunctive relief only on behalf of the\nNational Labor Relations Board on petition by it or one\nof its regional attorneys: \"To hold that the Taft-\nHartley Act also authorizes a private litigant to se-\ncure interim relief would be to ignore the closely\ncircumscribed jurisdiction given to the District Court\nand to generalize where Congress has chosen to specify.\"\n348 U.S. at 517. In contrast to the statutory scheme\nin Amal amated case, Congress, by enacting Title II of\nthe Civil Rights Act, specifically authorized private\npersons to secure injunctive relief.\n\n- 23 -\nb. Similarily, the authorizing statute need\nnot refer specifically to the possibility that state\ncourt proceedings might have to be enjoined. This\nCourt recently held in Beal v. Waltz, 309 F. 2d 721\n(C.A. 5, 1962), that 46 U.S.C. 185 expressly authorizes\na federal court to enjoin state court proceedings and\nthat, hence, 28 U.S.C. 2283, does not bar the injunction.\n6\nYet  U.S.C. 185 makes2no reference whatever to en-\nL \njoining state proceedings. In Providence & New York\nSteamship Co. v. Hill Manufacturing Co., 109 U.S. 528\n(1883), the Supreme Court pointed out that Section 185\ndid not refer to enjoining state proceedings but neverthe-\nless concluded: \"Surely [Section 185] applies as well\nto 'claims and proceedings' in state courts as to those\nin the federal courts; . . .\" The Court added that\nany further proceedings by the state courts \"would be\nagainst the express words\" of section 185.\nThe holding of this Court in Beal v. Waltz\napplies with even greater force to Title II of the Civil\nRights Act. Unlike 46 U.S.C. 185, which merely pro-\nvides that \"claims and proceedings . . . shall cease,\"\nTitle II specifically privides in section 204(a) for\nthe granting of injunctions.\n21/ The pertinent portion of this section provides:\n\"Upon compliance with the requirements of this section\nall claims and proceedings against the owner with\nrespect to the matter in question shall cease.\"\n\n- 24 -\nc. There are additional reasons for this\nresult here. Unlike 46 U.S.C. 185 and other statutory\nprovisions which come within the terms of the \"expressly\n22/\nauthorized\" language of section 22$3, the central\nobjective of section 203(c) (in conjunction with\nsection 204(a)) of the Civil Rights Act is to halt\ncourt proceedings brought to punish persons who seek\nto utilize public facilities and are barred from them\nsolely because of their race. And, as we show, supra,\nnot only does the legislative history of section 203(c)\nprove beyond doubt that Congress had such proceedings\nparticularly in mind when it enacted this section, but\nto hold otherwise would be to render section 203(c) of\nthe 1964 Act largely meaningless. Compare Great\nNorthern Railway v. United States, 208 U.S. 452, 465\n(1908); Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U.S. 205, 218 (1910).\nIt is noteworthy in this connection that\nthe Supreme Court in Leiter Minerals, Inc. v. United\nStates, 352 U.S. 220 (1957), the Court ruled that\nsection 2283 had no application where the United States\nwas a party. Invoking the rule of construction that a\nstatute which divests rights that would exist apart\n22/ See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. 1335, 2361 (the interpleader\nstatutes).\n\n- 25 -\nfrom the statute \"will not be applied to the sovereign\nwithout express words to that effect,\" United States v.\nUnited Mine Workers, 330 U.S. 258 (1947), the Court\nstated: \"the frustration of superior federal interests\nthat would ensue from precluding the Federal Government\nfrom obtaining a stay of state court proceedings except\nunder the severe restrictions of 28 U.S.C. 2283 would\nbe so great that we cannot reasonably impute such a\npurpose to Congress from the general language of 28\nU.S.C. 2283 alone.\" 352 U.S. at 226 (emphasis supplied).\nThe doctrine of Leiter Minerals may support the\nproposition that Title II of the 1964 Act is an ex-\nception to the general section 2283 rule.\nIn addition to providing for private suits,\nsection 204(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 allows\nthe Attorney General to intervene in such suits upon\nobtaining the court's permission and certifying they\nare of general public importance. Clearly section\n2283 would have no application if the Attorney General\nintervened. By authorizing the Attorney General to\nintervene, Congress has recognized in Title II actions\nthat \"superior federal interest\" which provides for\nthe section 2283 exception.\n3. a. In support of its conclusion that\nsection 2283 barred any relief, the court below cited\nBaines v. City of Danville, 337 F. 2d 579 (C.A.4, 1964).\n\n- 26 -\nAs the District Court read that decision, it \"held\nthat the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the other\nSections to which you referred, did not provide\nexceptions to the anti-injunction statute [§2283]\nthat we have been talking about.\" (R.85). The\nBaines case had nothing to do with Title II of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964. That case was brought\nunder 42 U.S.C. 1981-1983. The question before the\ncourt was whether the provision of 42 U.S. C. 1983\nauthorizing a \"suit in equity, or other proper pro-\nceeding for redress,\" falls within the statutory\nexception to 28 U.S.C. 2283. This question, which\n23/\nhas elicited conflicting views from the courts\n23/ Holding that the authority to seek injunctive\nrelief under 1983 is not an express authorization\nwithin the terms of section 2283 are Goss v. Illinois,\n312 F. 2d 257 (C.A. 7, 1963); Smith v. Village of\nLansing, 241 D. 2d 856 (C.A. 7, 1957); Sexton v. Barry,\n233 F. 2d 220 (C.A. 6, 1956); Alesna v.iR e 172 F. 2d\n176 (C.A. 9, 1949) (dictum); Aultman & Taylor Co. v.\nBrumfield, 102 Fed. 7 (C.C.N.D. Ohio, 1900); Hemsley v.\nMyers, 45 Fed. 283 (C.A. Kan., 1891); Chafee v. Johnson,\n229 F. Supp. 445 (S.D. Miss., 1964); Island Steamship\nLines Inc. v. Gdlenno n, 178 F. Supp. 292 D. Mass.,\n1959 alternateho  gg). Taking the opposite position\nare Cooper v. Hutchison 184 F. 2d 119 (C.A. 3, 1950);\nTuchman v. Welch, 42 Fed. 548 (C.C.D. Kan. 1890);\nTr ib u neReview ublishin Co. v. Thomas, 153 F. Supp.\n8(cid:9) W.D. Pa., 1957).\n\n- 27 -\n24/\nand the writers, troubled the court which was sitting\n25 /\nen banc. The majority rules that section 1983 did not\nexpressly authorize an injunction. The language of\nthe Court's opinion however, clearly demonstrates why\nthe result pertains only to section 1983:\nThe substantive right, in many situa-\ntions, may call for equitable relief,\nand equitable remedies are authorized,\nbut only by a general jurisdictional\ngrant. * * * [T]here is no incom-\npatibility between a generally created\nequity jurisdiction, and particularized\nlimitations which restrict a chancellor's\npower to define the limits of his dis-\ncretion. * * * If every grant of general\nequity jurisdiction created an exception\nto the anti-injunction statute, the\nstatute would be meaningless. [337 F.\n2d at 589]\nUnlike 42 U.S.C. 1983, which concededly is\na broad grant of general equity jurisdiction, section\n203(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a very\nnarrow grant of equity jurisdiction which has specific\napplication only where a person is punished for\nseeking to utilize places of public accommodation.\nThe court in Baines in no way suggested that it would\narrive at the same conclusion should it consider a\nstatute expressly authorizing preventive relief\nagainst courts which seek to punish persons exer-\ncising the right to enjoy the facilities of public\n24/ See e.g., Moore, Federal Practice, Vol. lA,\nU.213[2], p. 2417, Wright Federal Courts, §47, p. 156.\n25/ Chief Judge Sobeloff and Judge Bell dissented on\nthis issue.\n\n- 28 -\naccommodations. In fact, the court's stress on the\neneral equity jurisdiction created by section 1983\nstrongly suggests that it would reach the opposite\nconclusion in the instant case. Plainly, then, the\ndistrict court's reliance on the Baines opinion was\ntotally unwarranted.\nb. The court below also cited three\ndecisions by this Court which, according to Judge\nClayton, \"indicate very strongly\" that this Court\nwould reach here the Baines result:(R. 85-86).\nNone of the cases cited has any bearing\non the issues involved in the instant case.\nPoole v. Barnett, 336 F. 2d 267 (C.A. 5,\n1964), involved a request for an injunction against\nofficers of the State of Mississippi and the City\nof Jackson to restrain them from making further\n26 /\narrests for violations of the malicious trespass\n27/\nand the disturbance of worship laws of the State of\nMississippi. This Court pointed out that the Supreme\nCourt had not ruled that \"state action\" within the\nmeaning of the Fourteenth Amendment was involved\nwhen the police arrest trespassers at the request\nof an owner of property which he holds open to the\n2t Miss. Code, §2406\n27/ Miss. Code, §2090\n\n- 29 -\npublic for some purposes but otherwise maintains on a\nsegregated basis. The Court ruled that in \"this state\nof the law, we cannot hold that the trial court erred\nin denying the preliminary injunction.\" The question\nof the applicability of 28 U.S.C. 2283 never entered\nthe case.\nThe other two decisions cited, Brown v.\nW.A. \nRayfield, 320 F. 2d 96  5, 1963) and In Re Wykoff,\n6 Race Relations Law Reporter 793 (unreported), are\nhabeas corpus cases. The Court there held that\npersons who concededly had failed to exhaust their\nstate remedies as required by 28 U.S.C. 2254 did not\nmake a sufficient showing of an absence of an available\nstate remedy or the existence of circumstances\nrendering such remedy ineffective to protect their\nrights. Hence the exception to 28 U.S.C. 2254 was\nnot applicable and this Court dismissed the appeals.\nAgain, there was no reference to section 2283.\n\n- 30 -\nIII\nThe Injunction Requested in This\nCase is Tot arre y Rulesof\n_-- -----\nomITy\nThe general rule of non-interference by federal\n1\ncourts with state criminal proceedings was set forth by\nthe Supreme Court in Douglas v. Cif of- Jeannette, 319 U.S.\n157 (1943) , as follows:\nCongress, by its legislation, has\nadopted the policy, with certain well\ndefined statutory exceptions, of leaving\ngenerally to the state courts the trial\nof criminal cases arising under state laws,\nsubject to review by this Court of any\nfederal questions involved. Hence, courts\nof equity in the exercise\nof their discretionary powers should con-\nform to this policy by refusing to inter-\nfere with or embarrass threatened proceed-\nings in state courts save in those excep-\ntional cases which call for the inter-\nposition of a court of equity to prevent\nirreparable injury which is clear and\nimminent28/ ...\nUnderlying the principle of comity between state\nand federal courts is the notion that, since the decision of\nthe state court: is \nsubject to ultimate review by the Supreme\nCourt, the state judicial system should be permitted to\ncomplete its function undisturbed by premature interference\n7y the federal courts. Spielman Motor Sales  Co. v. Dodge,\n295 U.S. 89, 95-96 (1935); Fenner v. skin, 271 U.S. 240,\n244 (1926) .\n28/ C. F. Cleary v. Boyler, 371 U.S.'397 (19b3); Wilson v.\nnettler, 365 U.S. 381 (1961); Stefanelli v. Minardi 342\nU.S. 117 21951); Ponzi v. Fessenden, 258 U.S. 254+ (l922).\n\n- 31 -\nBut, as this Court stated in United States v.\nWood, 295 F. 2d 772, 779 (C.A. 5, 1961), \"the policy\nagainst interference with state criminal proceedings . . .\nis not one of statutory derivation.\" It is simply a rule\nof comity, \"not a rule distributing power as between the\nState and federal courts,\"(cid:9) v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391,\n425 (1963), and may at any time be abrogated by Congress.\nThis is precisely what was done when Congress enacted\nTitle II of the Civil Rights Act. Section 207(a) of the\n1964 Act provides:\nThe district courts of the United\nStates shall have jurisdiction of pro-\nceedings instituted pursuant to this\ntitle and shall exercise the same with-\nout regard to whether the aggrieved\nparty shall have exhausted any admini-\nstrative of other remedies that may be\nprovided by law.\nThis provision plainly and unambiguously removes\nTitle II cases from the ambit of the comity rule (for\nobvious reasons similar to those discussed in the preceding\nportion of this brief, su ra at pp. 16-19 ) .\nAny doubt that section 207(a) creates an exception\nto the rule of non-interference discussed in Jeannette\nwas removed by the decision of this Court in United States\nv. Wood, 295 F.2d 772 (C.A. 5, 1961). That case involved\na suit which, like the instant one, was brought to enjoin\n\n- 32 -\na pending criminal prosecution. The Wood opinion con-\nstrued section 131(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1957\n(42 U.S.C. 1971(d) which is virtually identical to\n29/\nsection 207(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as follows:\nThe court in this action is not\noperating under common-law equitable\nand discretionary doctrines, but under\na mandatory jurisdictional statute. As\nalready pointed out, the district court\nconsidered that it had jurisdiction over\nthis action but that such jurisdiction\nshould not be exercised to the extent of\nissuing the temporary restraining order.\nUnder the applicable jurisdictional sec-\ntion, we do not believe the court had\nthat choice.\nAfter quoting 42 U.S.C. 1971(d) the court continued\nFor several reasons, we hold that\nthis theory [ of non-interference with\nstate criminal proceedings set forth\nin Jeanette] is not applicable to the\npresent case.\nFirst, section 1971 creates a cause\nof action in the United States for\n\"preventive relief\" where a person has\nintimidated or has attempted to intimidate\nanother in the exercise of his right to\nvote. Where a federal statute has specif i-\ncally created a cause of action for_ preven-\ntive relief for intimidation, it may no\nlonger be said that this intimidation will\nnot be judicially recognized for the pur-\npose of establishing an equitable cause of\naction.\n29/ The statutes differ in two respects: (1) the 1957 Act\nstates: \"pursuant to this section\" while the 1964 Act states:\n\"pursuant to this title\";(2) where the 1957 Act speaks of the\n\"party aggrieved,\" the 1964 statute speaks of the \"aggrieved\nparty.\"\n\n- 33 -\nSecond, we believe that the affirma-\ntive defense of adequate state remedies\nhas been specifically removed by statute,\nfor subsection (d) expressly states that\nthe district court is to exercise juris-\ndiction without regard to whether the ag-\ngrieved party shall have exhausted other\nremedies provided by law. With this de-\nfense removed, there are no longer any\ngrounds for judicially ignoring that in-\ntimidation may exist in fact or that\nirreparable injury is not present.\nThe Wood opinion concluded by pointing out that\nits interpretation of section 1971(c) was \"in line with the\ndoctrine in other federal cases in this Circuit dealing\nwith the deprivation of constitutional rights on the basis\nof race or color.\" The Court noted that in Morrison v.\n30/\nDavis, 252 F. 2d 102 (C.A. 5, 1958), ! an injunctive action\n30/ In Morrison, this Court stated:\nWhatever may be the rule as to other threatened\nprosecutions, the Supreme Court in a case pre-\nsenting an identical factual issue affirmed the\njudgment of the trial court in the Browder case\n[Browder v. die, D.C.M. D. Ala., 1 1+ 2F. Supp.\n707, affirmed 1956, 352 U.S. 903] in which the\nsame contention was advanced. To the extent\nthat this is inconsistent with DouLlas v. City\nof Jeannett, Pa., 319 U.S. 157, 63 S.Ct. 877,\n87 L.Ed. 1324, we must consider the earlier\ncase modified.\nSee also Aelony v. Pace, No. 530 (M.D. Ga., Nov. 1, 1963)\n(unreported)) where Chief Judge Tuttle, writing for a three-\njudge court, granted an injunction forbidding prosecution of\nplaintiffs under Georgia insurrection and unlawful assembly\nstatutes: Anderson v. City of Albany, 321 F. 2d 649\n(C.A. 5, 1963); Bailey v. Patterson, 323 F. 2d 201\n(C.A. 5, 1963), cert. denied, 37^U.S. 910 (1964).\n\n-34-\n1\nbrought pursuant to 42 U.S.0  1983. Douglas v. Jeannette\nwas held to be inapplicable.\nIn short, Wood plainly holds that Jeannette is\ninapplicable to injunctive proceedings brought under a\n21\nmandatory jurisdictional statute such as 42  S.C. 1971\nor Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.If\n31/ It may also be said that, at least, in this Circuit,\nit is the rule that the Jeannette case is to be given \"a\nnarrow reading in civil rights cases,\" Dombrowski v. Pfister,\n227 F. Supp. 556, 583 (dissenting opinion of Judge Wisdom),\njurisd. noted, 377 U.S. 976 (1964).\n3?/ In cases analogous to the instant proceeding the equity\npowers of federal courts have also been invoked to entertain\na bill of peace to enjoin proceedings brought in state courts\nsolely for purposes of harassment. See Americ an Optometric\nAss'n v. Ritholz, 101 F 2d 883 (C.A. 7, 1939); Jamerson v.\nALli nce Ins. Co. of Philadelphia, 87 F. 2d 253 C.A. 7, 1937)\nwhich affirmed district court proceedings and held that the\npredecessor of 28 U.S.C. 2283 did not bar such relief. See\nalso Woodmen of the World v. O'Neil, 266 U.S. 292 (1924).\nProf essor Moore, in his \"Commentary on the U.S. Judicial\nCode,\" states that 28 U.S.C. 2283 permits such injunctive\nproceedings.\n\n- 35 -\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, it is suggested that\nthe order of the District Court be reversed.\nBURKE MARSHALL\nAssistant Attorney General,\nH.

DILWORTH, ET AL., APPELLANTS\nV.\nT. N. RINER, ET AL., APPELLEES\nON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI\nBRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n1. Pleadings and Procedure\nOn September 22, 1964, a complaint was filed\nby 18 Negro citizens (the appellants here) in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District\nof Mississippi. The complaint alleged that appellants\n(1)\n\n- 2 -\n1 /\nand others similarily situated were refused service\nby an employee of Tom's Restaurant and were arrested\nand prosecuted by Dan Adams, Chief of Police, of\nAberdeen, James Harmon, Sheriff and Jessee Lackey,\nDeputy Sheriff of Monroe County, Richard Booth, City\nAttorney of Aberdeen, and George Howell, Judge of the\nMunicipal Court of Aberdeen (the appellees here) when\n2/\nthey failed to leave the restaurant. Appellants fur-\nther alleged that the acts of appellees in refusing to\nserve, arresting, and prosecuting them were violative\nof, inter alia, Title II of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964. A temporary restraining order was sought to\nenjoin appellees from proceeding further with the\ntrial of appellants in the Municipal Court of Aberdeen,\n3/\nwhich trial had been set for hearing on October 7, 1964.\nAppellants also sought to enjoin appellees from con-\ntinuing or maintaining any policy or practice of deny-\ning or interferring with appellants' use and enjoyment\n1 / The complaint was brought as a class action pursuant\nto Rule 23(a)(3), Fed. Rules Civ. Proc.\n2 / T. N. Riner, owner of Tom's Restaurant, is also an\nappellee.\n3 / The United States understands that, by informal\nagreement of the parties, trial of appellants in the\nmunicipal court proceeding has been postponed pending\nthe outcome of the instant proceeding.\n\n-3-\nof Tom's Restaurant and other public accommodations\nin Aberdeen or the punishment of appellants for the\nuse of such facilities, because of their race or color.\nA hearing was held in the District Court on\nOctober 2, 1964, and numerous witnesses were called.\nAt the conclusion of the hearing the court stated that\nthe demand for a temporary restraining order would be\ndenied. An order to this effect was filed on October 5,\n1964. This appeal followed.\n2. The Evidence\nAt the hearing on October 2, five of the\nappellants testified that they had occasion to visit\n4/\nTom's Restaurant on September 5, 1964 (R. 8, 15, 23, 34,\n43, 51). They further testified that upon requesting\nservice, they were told they would have to go around to\nthe back of the restaurant to obtain service (R. 9, 16,\n26, 34, 45).\n4/ Counsel for appellants sought in the court below to\nexamine Mrs. Riner, who is part owner of Tom's Restaurant,\nfor the purpose of showing sufficient involving of the\nrestaurant in commerce to bring it within the terms of\nTitle II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The court, how-\never, excused Mrs. Riner from testifying, ruling that, for\nthe purposes of the application for the temporary restrain-\ning order, it would assume that the restaurant was covered\nby the Civil Rights Act (R. 73-74).\n5/ The restaurant served Negroes in a special area\nreached by passing through a separate door in the back\nof the establishment (R. 9, 18, 26, 34, 44).\n\n-4-\nWhile the Negroes remained seated, the waitress\n6/\nand a middle-aged lady made several telephone calls\n(R. 11, 25, 27, 35). The police arrived and one officer\ntold the waitress to request appellants to leave (R. 11,\n17, 27, 36, 45). She made the request but appellants\nrefused to comply and they were placed under arrest by\nOfficer Newman (R. 11, 17, 28, 36, 46, 53). When asked\nto specify the charges, an officer replied that they\nwere arrested for trespassing and disturbing the peace\n(R. 11, 17, 28, 36, 46). Appellants were then taken to\nthe police station (R. 12, 28, 37, 47).\nMr. Dan Adams, Chief of Police of Aberdeen,\ntestified that he entered the restaurant and informed\nappellant Galloway that the Negroes were under arrest\nfor trespassing and disturbing the peace (R. 53). The\nMayor of Aberdeen, who is also presiding judge of the\nJustice of the Peace Court, testified that the Negroes\n6/ The lady was apparently Mrs. T. N. Riner (R. 27, 36).\n7/ When asked what were the acts that constituted dis-\nturbing the peace, the Chief of Police stated: \"Well,\nthey were pulling the napkins out of the holders on the\ntable and pouring salt and pepper into the napkins, and\nMr. Riner said he wanted them out.\" (R. 54, 55). We\ndo not regard this testimony as having any bearing on\nthe case. Even assuming that the incident, if true, is\nevidence of a true breach of the peace, a suggestion we\nfind difficult to believe, the affidavit of arrest makes\nno mention of the incident or in any way suggests that\nsuch an incident was a basis for the arrests.\n\n-5-\nwho entered the restaurant were charged with refusing\nto leave the premises of Tom's Restaurant after being\nrequested to do so (R. 60). He stated that they were\nnot charged with disturbing the peace (R. 60).\nThe United States has seen the affidavits of\narrest (each of which is identical except for the name\nof defendant) and has reprinted the text of one of them\nas an appendix to this brief. The affidavits charge the\n8/\nNegroes with violating Mississippi Code, Section 2087.5,\n9/\nwhich punishes breach of the peace.\n8 / Another statutory provision recited in the affidavit,\nHouse Bill 960 of the 1964 Legislature provides, inter\nalia, that minors charged with violating section 2087.5\nshall not be tried in the Youth Court.\n9/ Although the affidavit talks of breach of the peace,\nYE describes conduct which is more akin to trespass.\nBut whether the charge be phrased in \"trespass\" or \"breach\nof the peace\" terms, it is clear that the acts for which\nthe Negroes were arrested were entering a restaurant,\nrequesting service, and remaining seated when asked to\nleave. As we demonstrate, infra, pp. 16-19 , this con-\nduct is protected by the Civil ights Act of 1964 and\nthe name attached to it is of no legal significance.\n\n-6-\nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES\nTitle II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nguarantees all citizens equal access to places of public\naccommodation. In the instant case this Court is called\nupon to determine whether section 203(c) of that Title\nauthorizes a federal district court to enjoin state court\nproceedings brought for the purpose of punishing persons\nseeking to enjoy use of public accommodations. Obviously,\nthe 1964 Act will be vitiated if persons exercising\nrights under that Act are subject to arrest and harassment.\nThus, the decision in this case raises basic questions as\nto the effectiveness of the new law.\nThe interest of the United States in the\nimplementation of the 1964 Act is clear. Title II ex-\npressly authorizes the United States to bring suit to\nenforce that Title. Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v.\nUnited States,(cid:9) U.S.(cid:9) (Dec. 14, 1964); Katzenbach v.\nMcClung,(cid:9) U.S.(cid:9) (Dec. 14, 1964); see also United\nStates v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17 (1960). In light of this\nplain and direct interest, and the great public im-\nportance of this case, we believe that it is incumbent\nupon the United States to express its views.\n\n- 7 -\nA D(_11ML`U9'\n1. A preliminary issue before this Court is\nwhether the order of the district court denying the\napplication for a temporary restraining order is ap-\npealable. Appellants argue in their brief that the\norder is appealable under the test announced in United\nStates v. Wood, 295 F. 2d 772 (C.A. 5, 1961). For that\nreason, we will concentrate here on the alternative\nargument that the District Court's order should be\ntreated as one denying an application for a preliminary\ninjunction and that it is for that reason appealable\nunder 28 U.S.C. 1292(a)(1).\n2. The central issue in this case is whether\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorizes a federal court\nto enjoin a state court from proceeding with a criminal\ntrial brought to punish persons who were arrested for\nrequesting service in a restaurant covered by that Act.\nTwo possible obstacles to the issuance of\nsuch an injunction have been suggested.\nThe first is the statutory rule, embodied in 28\nU.S.C. 2283, which prohibits a court of the United States\nfrom granting an injunction to state state court pro-\nceedings except (1) as expressly authorized by Act of\nCongress, (2) where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,\nor (3) to protect its judgments. We will demonstrate,\nby an examination of the language and legislative\n\n-8-\nhistory of Title II, one of the recent Supreme Court\ndecisions construing Title II, and the decisions in-\nM\nterpreting the \"expressly authorized\" language of\nSection 2283, that Title II of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964 is an express authorization within the meaning\nof the first exception to section 2283, to enjoin criminal\nproceedings for acts protected by that Title.\nThe second is the judicially created rule of\nnon-interference with state criminal proceedings which\napplies even where 28 U.S.C. 2283 does not. We will show\nthat the language of Title II expressly exempts this proceed-\ning from the usual rule of non-interference.\n\n- 9 -\nI\nThis Court Has Jurisdiction to Review the\nDenial of Interlocutory Relief Below\n1. The issue necessarily preliminary to all\nother questions is whether the order here complained\nof is appealable. Appellants framed their request\nfor preliminary relief in a prayer for a temporary\nrestraining order to enjoin their further prosecution\nin the Aberdeen Municipal Court. Thereafter, the action\nbelow was referred to as one for a temporary restraining\n10/\norder by the parties and the court.\nCertain interlocutory orders such as those\ngranting or denying preliminary injunctions may be\n11/\nreviewed under 28 U.S.C. 1292(a)Z1). Deckert v.\nIndependence Share Corp., 311 U.S. 282 (1941); Peters\n10/ The order of October 5, 1964, specifically denied\nappellants' prayer for a \"temporary restraining order.\"\n11/ 28 U.S.C. 1292 provides in part:\n(a) The courts of appeals shall have juris-\ndiction of appeals from:\n(1) Interlocutory orders of the district\ncourts of United States * * * granting\ncontinuing, modifying, refusing or\ndissolving injunctions, or refusing\n•(cid:9) to dissolve or modify injunctions,\nexcept where a direct review may be\nhad in the Supreme Court.\n\n- 10 -\nv. Standard Oil Co., 174 F. 2d 162 (C.A. 5, 1949).\nOn the other hand, the denial of a temporary restrain-\ning order is not appealable under that section.  The\nappealability of an order does not, however, depend\nLI\nupon the terminology used by the parties or the court\nbut upon substantive factors bearing upon the real\nnature of the proceeding below. Western Union Tele-\ngraph Co. v. United States & Mexican Trust Co o , 221\nFed. 545, 553 (C.A. 8, 1915); Connell v. Dulien Steel\nProducts, 240 F. 2d 414, 418 (C,A. 5, 1957).\nThe question here, therefore, is not what\nthe proceeding below was labelled, but whether, under\nthe circumstances of the case, the denial of the\n\"temporary restraining order\" was in reality the\ndenial of a preliminary injunction.\n2. A temporary restraining order is\ngenerally issued without notice to the adverse party,\nor, where notice is given, after a hearing which has\na most summary character. See Connell v. Dulien Steel\nProducts, 240 F, 2d 414, 418 (C.A. 5, 1957); Pennsylvania\nR.R. v. Transport Workers Union, 278 F. 2d 693 (C.A. 3,\n1960); 7 Moore, Federal Practice p. 1642-1643. The(cid:9)\nV\npractical reason for not allowing an appeal from such\nan order, other than the fact that it is usually\neffective for only a brief period of time (less than\nthe time normally required for an appeal), is that\n\n- 11 -\nthe trial judge has not had the advantage of a full_\npresentation of the facts and Law before entering an order.\nConnell v. Dulien Steel Products, su ra. At this stage of\nthe case questions of a legal and a factual nature bearing\non whether the lower court would grant a preliminary in-\njunction are usually unanswered. Orderly procedure re-\nquires that -- at least in most circumstances -- the\ntrial judge be permitted to pass on these questions at the\ntime of the more complete hearing for a preliminary injunc-\ntion before his decision is reviewed by a higher court.\nSee Cohen v. Beneficial Loan 0o12., 337 U.S. 541, 546\n12/\n(1949); Connell v. Dulien Steel Products, sujra; (cid:9) Pan\nAmerican World Airlines v. Flight ^h ineers Intl Ass'n,\n306 F. 2d 840, 842-843 (C.A. 2, 1962).\n12/ \nIn Connell this Court found that (240 F. 2d at 418):\nIt is not at all clear that the court\nbelow would actually have granted a\npreliminary injunction, for there are\nseveral legal questions that might well_\nhave been passed on at such a hearing.\nOrderly procedure requires that the trial\ncourt be given the opportunity of passing\non these legal matters at the time of the\nhearing of the motion for preliminary in-\njunction. Also, the plaintiff below should\nbe required at the hearing on preliminary\ninjunction to make out a prima facie case\non the merits in order to obtain in-\njunctive relief.\n\n- 12 -\n(cid:9)\nIt is apparent that these reasons do not U\napply where, as we show infra, there has been adequate\nnotice and a full hearing on the question of whether\nan injunction shall be issued.\na. In Western Union Telegraph Co. v. United\nStates & Mexican Trust Co., 221 Fed. 545 (C.A. 8, 1915),\nthe telegraph company and all other creditors of a\nrailroad line were restrained, after a hearing on\npetition of the trust company, from commencing or\nprosecuting any action against the railroad. On\nappeal, the trust company contended that the orders\nbelow were mere restraining orders and not appealable.\nThe Court of Appeals recognized that a restraining\norder granted without a hearing is not ordinarily\nappealable, but it concluded that (221 Fed. at 553):\n. . . a restraining order which is\ngranted, or sustained, or denied after a\nhearing of the parties, and which is in\neffect and in everything but name, is\na temporary injunction, falls within\nthe evident meaning of the statute\n[Judicial Code §129, now 28 U.S.C.\n1292(a)(1) as amended] and is reviewable\nby appeal * * *•\n\n- 13 -\nIn this Circuit, in Connell v. Dulien Steel\nProducts, supra, the District Court had granted an\norder temporarily restraining appellants from enforcing\na judgment in the Louisiana state courts. While this\nCourt held that the order was not appealable, it\nreached this result for factual reasons. Indeed,\nthe Court explicitly recognized that \"the question of\nappealability should not depend on mere terminology\nbut on whether the order is one within the purview of\n§1292\" (240 F. 2d at 418). The order in Connell was\nissued on the same day as the motion for a \"temporary\nrestraining order\" was filed and after only a most\n13/\nsummary hearing.\n13/ Similarly, in Woods v. Wright, 334 F. 2d 369 (C.A.\n5, 1964), where it was urged that the denial of a\ntemporary restraining order was in fact a refusal to\ngrant a preliminary injunction, this Court implied\nthat because of the summary nature of the proceeding,\nwhat was involved was the denial of a temporary\nrestraining order. The Court ultimately found it\nunnecessary specifically to rule on this point\nsince the order was a final and appealable decision\nunder United States v. Wood, 295 F. 2d 772 (C.A. 5,\n1961). It is to be noted that in Woods v. Wright,\nthe notice itself was inadequate to support a pre-\nliminary injunction since the hearing was held on\nthe same day as the action was filed. Moreover,\nthe hearing at which both parties we're represented\nby counsel was summary in nature, and not a full\nevidentiary hearing as in this case.\n\n- 14 -\nHere the request for a temporary restraining\norder was filed on September 22, 1964, and on September 24,\n1964, a summons was served on each of the appellees. The\nhearing before the District Court was not held until eight(cid:9) t\ndays later. At the hearing all the appellees except T. N.\n14/\nRiney were represented by counsel. Eight witnesses,\nthree of whom were appellees, testified concerning the\nattempts of the Negroes to receive service at the restau-\nrants and the subsequent arrests by the police. Appellees'\ncounsels were given full opportunity to cross-examine\nall witnesses.\nIn short, the proceedings below had all the\nsubstantive characteristics of a hearing on a motion\nfor a preliminary injunction.\nb. The legal issues in this case were decided\nby the District Court in such a way that, of necessity,\nthe resolution of those issues also disposes of any formal\napplication that might be made for a preliminary or perma-\nnent injunction. Judge Clayton held that he was without\nauthority to issue any injunctive relief against the state\ncourt proceedings because of 28 U.S.C. 2283. He stated\nthat (R. 84):\n14/ Mrs. T. N. Riner, wife of one of the appellees,\nstated that she and her husband decided that they did\nnot want counsel (R. 69, 70). Mr. Riner did not testify.\n\n- 15 -\nThere is no part of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964 . . . [which empowers] this\nCourt to . . . enjoin proceedings in State\nCourt contrary to the provisions of 28\nU.S.C. 2283. . . .\nWith the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nmaking no provision by any of its parts\nfor this Court to enjoin proceedings in\nState Court, it is my view that this Court\nis wholly without authority to grant the\nrestraining order. . . .\nThe rationale of that decision requires, of\ncourse, the denial of all relief, whether temporary or\npermanent. It follows that any further hearing in the\n15/\nDistrict Court would be futile. Thus the principal\nreason advanced by this Court in the Connell case for\nnot allowing an appeal from the order therein has no\napplication here. See note 12, supra, p. 11.\nIn short, under any test which considers\nsubstance rather than semantics, the proceeding below\nwas one for a preliminary injunction, and its denial\ntherefore was appealable as such.\n15/ It is, of course, well settled that courts of\nequity will not require the doing of a futile act.\nMontana Nat'l Bank v. Yellowstone County, 276 U.S.\n499, 505 (1928); Orleans Parish School Board v.\nBush, 138 F. Supp. 327 E.D.

No person shall . . .\n(c) punish or attempt to punish any\nperson for exercising or attempting to\nexercise any right or privilege secured\nby section 201 or 202.\nSection 204. (a) Whenever any person\nhas engaged or there are reasonable grounds\nto believe that any person is about to\nengage in any act or practice prohibited by\nsection 203, a civil action for preventive\nrelief, including an application for a perm-\nanent or temporary injunction, restraining\norder, or other order, may be instituted by\nthe person aggrieved and, upon timely appli-\ncation, the court may, in its discretion, permit\nthe Attorney General to intervene in such civil\naction if he certifies that the case is of\ngeneral public importance. . . .\nIn our view, these provisions make clear the\nstatutory purpose to provide for injunctive relief\nagainst anyone who attempts to punish another for\nattempting to exercise his right to equal enjoyment\nof the facilities of an included place of public accom-\nmodation, such as a restaurant. ^\n16/ (continued from preceding page)\nfrom discrimination or segregation of any kind on the\nground of race, color, religion, or national origin, if\nsuch discrimination or segregation is or purports to be\nrequired by any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, rule,\nor order of a State or any agency or political subdivision\nthereof,\" is not relevant to this issue.\n17/ Appellees contend that the acts for which appellants\nwere arrested by state authorities were entirely unrelated\nto their right to the equal enjoyment of the facilities of\nTom's Restaurant. They assert that appellants, having been\n(continued on following page)\n\n- 18 -\n(b) One of the forms of punishment, and no\ndoubt the principal form contemplated by the drafters\nof section 203 (c), was the arrest and prosecution of\nC\npersons seeking access to places of public accommoda-\ntion solely because of their race.\nIt is difficult to understand what section\n203(c) would mean if it did not mean to prohibit arrests\nand prosecutions for using a place or public accommodation.\nActs of private \"punishment\" would as well be covered\nby section 203(b) which prohibits intimidating, threat-\nening, or coercing a person for the purpose of inter-\nfering with rights secured by section 201 or 202.\n17/ (Continued from preceding page)\ndenied service, had laid the predicate for having their\nrights declared by the courts and were required to leave\nthe premises of the restaurant. Their arrest in their\nview, was not for attempting to exercise their right to\nservice, but for the physical occupancy of another's prent\nises. This contention was authoritatively disposed of\nby the Supreme Court decision in Hamm v. City of Rockfill,\nU.S.(cid:9) (Dec. 14, 1964) where it was argued that the\nictims of discrimination are restricted to the statutory\nmechanisms for the redress of any infringement of the\nright to access to a place of public accommodation. In\nsquarely rejecting this contention, the Court declared\n(Slip Opinion, p. 5) :\nAlthough we agree that the law generally\ncondemns self-help, the language of §203(c)\nsupports a conclusion that non-forcible attempts\nto gain admittance to or remain in establishments\ncovered by the Act, are immunized from prosecu-\ntion, for the statute speaks of exercising or\nattempting to exercise a \"right or privilege\"\nsecured by its earlier provisions.\n\n- 19 -\n(c) The legislative history of section 203(c)\nfully supports this conclusion. Senator Humphrey, Floor\nManager of the Act in the Senate, stated that\n[S]ection 203(c) . . . \nprohibits the\nimposition of punishment upon any person\n\"for exercising or attempting to exercise\nany right or privilege\" secured by section\n201 or 202. This plainly means that a\ndefendant in a criminal trespass, breach\nof the peace, or other similar case can\nassert the rights created by 201 and 202\nand that State courts must entertain de-\nfenses grounded upon these provisions.\n(110 Cong. Rec. 9463, daily ed; May 1, 1964)\nThe opponents of the measure had a similar understanding.\nCongressman Harris of Arkansas opposes section 203(c) on\nthe ground that it \"would interfere with the enforcement\nof trespass laws in every State in the Union.\" (110\nCong. Rec. 1843 (daily ed. February 4, 1964)). Likewise,\nSenator Stennis of Mississippi said:\nAs to State judges and State laa enforce-\nment officers, Section 203(c) provides that\n\"no person shall (c) punish or attempt to\npunish any person for exercising or attempting\nto exercise any right or privilege secured by\nSection 201 or 202.\" This is patently an\nattempt to make enforcement by State judges\nand State law enforcement officers of State\nlaws which may later be held to conflict\nwith the act a violation of a federal law\nand to subject them to punitive Federal\naction. (110 Cong. Rec. 6871 (daily ed.\nApril 7, 1964)).\n\n- 20 -\n(d) Any remaining doubt as to the meaning\nof section 203(c) has been removed by the decision of 18/\nthe Supreme Court in Hamm v. City of Rock Hill, supra.—_\nAfter stating that \"The Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids\ndiscrimination in places of public accommodation and\nremoves peaceful attempts to be served on an equal basis\nfrom the category of punishable activities,\" the Court\ncontinued (slip opinion p. 5):\nOn its face, this language prohibits pros-\necution of any person for seeking service\nin a covered establishment because of his\nrace or color, * * * [T]he language of\n§203(c) supports a conclusion that non-\nforcible attempts to gain admittance to\nor remain in establishments covered by the\nAct, are immunized from prosecution, for\nthe statute speaks of exercising or\nattempting to exercise a \"right or privi-\nlege\" secured by its earlier provisions. * *\nIn effect the Act prohibits the application\nof state laws in a way that would deprive\nany person of the rights granted under the\nAct. * * * there can be no question that\nthis was the intended result here in light\nof §203(c).\n18/ Although the court split 5-4 on these decisions,\nthe split was over the question whether the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964 abated convictions of persons who had been\nsentenced on charges of trespass for \"sitting in\" at\nrestaurants prior to passage of the 1964 Act. The Court\nwas not divided on the question of the meaning of\n\"punishment\" in 203(c).\n\n- 21 -\n(e) The Supreme Court in Hamm stated that\nthe language of section 203(c) on its face prohibits\nthe prosecution of anyone for seeking service in a\ncovered establishment because of his race or color.\nPlainly, too, section 204 provides, on its face, that:\nWhenever any person has engaged or there\nare reasonable grounds to believe that any\nperson is about to engage in any act or\npractice prohibited by section 203, a civil\naction for preventive relief, including an\napplication for a permanent or temporary\ninjunction, restraining order, or other\norder, may be instituted by the person\naggrieved . . .\nIn light of this explicit language, there\ncan be no doubt but that Title II expressly authorizes\nUnited States courts to enjoin state court proceedings\nwithin the terms of 28 U.S.C. 2283. Congress could\nhave made its express authorization even more specific\nonly by (1) specifically referring to section 2283 or\n(2) specifically referring to the enjoining of state\ncourts. But neither of these references is necessary\nto meet the \"expressly authorized\" requirements of\nsection 2283.\n\n- 22 -\n2. a. In Amalgamated Clothing Workers of\nAmerica v. Richmond Brothers, 348 U.S. 511 (1955),\nthe Supreme Court considered for the first time the\nlanguage of 28 U.S.C. 2283 which had been enacted in(cid:9) t\n1948 as part of the revised Title 28 of the United\n19/\nStates Code. In holding that the Taft-Hartley Act\ncreated no express exceptions to section 2283 that\nwould permit petitioner to enjoin state proceedings,\nthe Court noted pointedly that an authorization to\nprovide an exemption from the generality of section\n20/\n2283 \"need not expressly refer to §2283.\"\n19/ For a discussion of the history of the predecessor\nof section 2283 and the reasons for its modification,\nsee, in addition to the Amalgamated case, Touce v.\nNew York Life Ins. Co., 314 U.S. 118 (1941); Jacksonville\nBlow Pipe Co. v. Reconstruction Finance Corp., 244\nF. 2d 394 C.A. 5, 1957); and T. Smith & on Inc. v.\nWilliams, 275 F. 2d 397 (C.A. 5, 1960).\n20/ In the Amalgamated case itself, the Court was\nunable to find an express authorization for an ex-\nemption \"within even the most attenuated meaning of\nthe term.\" The provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act, the\nCourt emphasized, gave jurisdiction to the district\ncourts to grant injunctive relief only on behalf of the\nNational Labor Relations Board on petition by it or one\nof its regional attorneys: \"To hold that the Taft-\nHartley Act also authorizes a private litigant to se-\ncure interim relief would be to ignore the closely\ncircumscribed jurisdiction given to the District Court\nand to generalize where Congress has chosen to specify.\"\n348 U.S. at 517. In contrast to the statutory scheme\nin Amal amated case, Congress, by enacting Title II of\nthe Civil Rights Act, specifically authorized private\npersons to secure injunctive relief.\n\n- 23 -\nb. Similarily, the authorizing statute need\nnot refer specifically to the possibility that state\ncourt proceedings might have to be enjoined. This\nCourt recently held in Beal v. Waltz, 309 F. 2d 721\n(C.A. 5, 1962), that 46 U.S.C. 185 expressly authorizes\na federal court to enjoin state court proceedings and\nthat, hence, 28 U.S.C. 2283, does not bar the injunction.\n6\nYet  U.S.C. 185 makes2no reference whatever to en-\nL \njoining state proceedings. In Providence & New York\nSteamship Co. v. Hill Manufacturing Co., 109 U.S. 528\n(1883), the Supreme Court pointed out that Section 185\ndid not refer to enjoining state proceedings but neverthe-\nless concluded: \"Surely [Section 185] applies as well\nto 'claims and proceedings' in state courts as to those\nin the federal courts; . . .\" The Court added that\nany further proceedings by the state courts \"would be\nagainst the express words\" of section 185.\nThe holding of this Court in Beal v. Waltz\napplies with even greater force to Title II of the Civil\nRights Act. Unlike 46 U.S.C. 185, which merely pro-\nvides that \"claims and proceedings . . . shall cease,\"\nTitle II specifically privides in section 204(a) for\nthe granting of injunctions.\n21/ The pertinent portion of this section provides:\n\"Upon compliance with the requirements of this section\nall claims and proceedings against the owner with\nrespect to the matter in question shall cease.\"\n\n- 24 -\nc. There are additional reasons for this\nresult here. Unlike 46 U.S.C. 185 and other statutory\nprovisions which come within the terms of the \"expressly\n22/\nauthorized\" language of section 22$3, the central\nobjective of section 203(c) (in conjunction with\nsection 204(a)) of the Civil Rights Act is to halt\ncourt proceedings brought to punish persons who seek\nto utilize public facilities and are barred from them\nsolely because of their race. And, as we show, supra,\nnot only does the legislative history of section 203(c)\nprove beyond doubt that Congress had such proceedings\nparticularly in mind when it enacted this section, but\nto hold otherwise would be to render section 203(c) of\nthe 1964 Act largely meaningless. Compare Great\nNorthern Railway v. United States, 208 U.S. 452, 465\n(1908); Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U.S. 205, 218 (1910).\nIt is noteworthy in this connection that\nthe Supreme Court in Leiter Minerals, Inc. v. United\nStates, 352 U.S. 220 (1957), the Court ruled that\nsection 2283 had no application where the United States\nwas a party. Invoking the rule of construction that a\nstatute which divests rights that would exist apart\n22/ See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. 1335, 2361 (the interpleader\nstatutes).\n\n- 25 -\nfrom the statute \"will not be applied to the sovereign\nwithout express words to that effect,\" United States v.\nUnited Mine Workers, 330 U.S. 258 (1947), the Court\nstated: \"the frustration of superior federal interests\nthat would ensue from precluding the Federal Government\nfrom obtaining a stay of state court proceedings except\nunder the severe restrictions of 28 U.S.C. 2283 would\nbe so great that we cannot reasonably impute such a\npurpose to Congress from the general language of 28\nU.S.C. 2283 alone.\" 352 U.S. at 226 (emphasis supplied).\nThe doctrine of Leiter Minerals may support the\nproposition that Title II of the 1964 Act is an ex-\nception to the general section 2283 rule.\nIn addition to providing for private suits,\nsection 204(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 allows\nthe Attorney General to intervene in such suits upon\nobtaining the court's permission and certifying they\nare of general public importance. Clearly section\n2283 would have no application if the Attorney General\nintervened. By authorizing the Attorney General to\nintervene, Congress has recognized in Title II actions\nthat \"superior federal interest\" which provides for\nthe section 2283 exception.\n3. a. In support of its conclusion that\nsection 2283 barred any relief, the court below cited\nBaines v. City of Danville, 337 F. 2d 579 (C.A.4, 1964).\n\n- 26 -\nAs the District Court read that decision, it \"held\nthat the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the other\nSections to which you referred, did not provide\nexceptions to the anti-injunction statute [§2283]\nthat we have been talking about.\" (R.85). The\nBaines case had nothing to do with Title II of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964. That case was brought\nunder 42 U.S.C. 1981-1983. The question before the\ncourt was whether the provision of 42 U.S. C. 1983\nauthorizing a \"suit in equity, or other proper pro-\nceeding for redress,\" falls within the statutory\nexception to 28 U.S.C. 2283. This question, which\n23/\nhas elicited conflicting views from the courts\n23/ Holding that the authority to seek injunctive\nrelief under 1983 is not an express authorization\nwithin the terms of section 2283 are Goss v. Illinois,\n312 F. 2d 257 (C.A. 7, 1963); Smith v. Village of\nLansing, 241 D. 2d 856 (C.A. 7, 1957); Sexton v. Barry,\n233 F. 2d 220 (C.A. 6, 1956); Alesna v.iR e 172 F. 2d\n176 (C.A. 9, 1949) (dictum); Aultman & Taylor Co. v.\nBrumfield, 102 Fed. 7 (C.C.N.D. Ohio, 1900); Hemsley v.\nMyers, 45 Fed. 283 (C.A. Kan., 1891); Chafee v. Johnson,\n229 F. Supp. 445 (S.D. Miss., 1964); Island Steamship\nLines Inc. v. Gdlenno n, 178 F. Supp. 292 D. Mass.,\n1959 alternateho  gg). Taking the opposite position\nare Cooper v. Hutchison 184 F. 2d 119 (C.A. 3, 1950);\nTuchman v. Welch, 42 Fed. 548 (C.C.D. Kan. 1890);\nTr ib u neReview ublishin Co. v. Thomas, 153 F. Supp.\n8(cid:9) W.D. Pa., 1957).\n\n- 27 -\n24/\nand the writers, troubled the court which was sitting\n25 /\nen banc. The majority rules that section 1983 did not\nexpressly authorize an injunction. The language of\nthe Court's opinion however, clearly demonstrates why\nthe result pertains only to section 1983:\nThe substantive right, in many situa-\ntions, may call for equitable relief,\nand equitable remedies are authorized,\nbut only by a general jurisdictional\ngrant. * * * [T]here is no incom-\npatibility between a generally created\nequity jurisdiction, and particularized\nlimitations which restrict a chancellor's\npower to define the limits of his dis-\ncretion. * * * If every grant of general\nequity jurisdiction created an exception\nto the anti-injunction statute, the\nstatute would be meaningless. [337 F.\n2d at 589]\nUnlike 42 U.S.C. 1983, which concededly is\na broad grant of general equity jurisdiction, section\n203(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a very\nnarrow grant of equity jurisdiction which has specific\napplication only where a person is punished for\nseeking to utilize places of public accommodation.\nThe court in Baines in no way suggested that it would\narrive at the same conclusion should it consider a\nstatute expressly authorizing preventive relief\nagainst courts which seek to punish persons exer-\ncising the right to enjoy the facilities of public\n24/ See e.g., Moore, Federal Practice, Vol. lA,\nU.213[2], p. 2417, Wright Federal Courts, §47, p. 156.\n25/ Chief Judge Sobeloff and Judge Bell dissented on\nthis issue.\n\n- 28 -\naccommodations. In fact, the court's stress on the\neneral equity jurisdiction created by section 1983\nstrongly suggests that it would reach the opposite\nconclusion in the instant case. Plainly, then, the\ndistrict court's reliance on the Baines opinion was\ntotally unwarranted.\nb. The court below also cited three\ndecisions by this Court which, according to Judge\nClayton, \"indicate very strongly\" that this Court\nwould reach here the Baines result:(R. 85-86).\nNone of the cases cited has any bearing\non the issues involved in the instant case.\nPoole v. Barnett, 336 F. 2d 267 (C.A. 5,\n1964), involved a request for an injunction against\nofficers of the State of Mississippi and the City\nof Jackson to restrain them from making further\n26 /\narrests for violations of the malicious trespass\n27/\nand the disturbance of worship laws of the State of\nMississippi. This Court pointed out that the Supreme\nCourt had not ruled that \"state action\" within the\nmeaning of the Fourteenth Amendment was involved\nwhen the police arrest trespassers at the request\nof an owner of property which he holds open to the\n2t Miss. Code, §2406\n27/ Miss. Code, §2090\n\n- 29 -\npublic for some purposes but otherwise maintains on a\nsegregated basis. The Court ruled that in \"this state\nof the law, we cannot hold that the trial court erred\nin denying the preliminary injunction.\" The question\nof the applicability of 28 U.S.C. 2283 never entered\nthe case.\nThe other two decisions cited, Brown v.\nW.A. \nRayfield, 320 F. 2d 96  5, 1963) and In Re Wykoff,\n6 Race Relations Law Reporter 793 (unreported), are\nhabeas corpus cases. The Court there held that\npersons who concededly had failed to exhaust their\nstate remedies as required by 28 U.S.C. 2254 did not\nmake a sufficient showing of an absence of an available\nstate remedy or the existence of circumstances\nrendering such remedy ineffective to protect their\nrights. Hence the exception to 28 U.S.C. 2254 was\nnot applicable and this Court dismissed the appeals.\nAgain, there was no reference to section 2283.\n\n- 30 -\nIII\nThe Injunction Requested in This\nCase is Tot arre y Rulesof\n_-- -----\nomITy\nThe general rule of non-interference by federal\n1\ncourts with state criminal proceedings was set forth by\nthe Supreme Court in Douglas v. Cif of- Jeannette, 319 U.S.\n157 (1943) , as follows:\nCongress, by its legislation, has\nadopted the policy, with certain well\ndefined statutory exceptions, of leaving\ngenerally to the state courts the trial\nof criminal cases arising under state laws,\nsubject to review by this Court of any\nfederal questions involved. Hence, courts\nof equity in the exercise\nof their discretionary powers should con-\nform to this policy by refusing to inter-\nfere with or embarrass threatened proceed-\nings in state courts save in those excep-\ntional cases which call for the inter-\nposition of a court of equity to prevent\nirreparable injury which is clear and\nimminent28/ ...\nUnderlying the principle of comity between state\nand federal courts is the notion that, since the decision of\nthe state court: is \nsubject to ultimate review by the Supreme\nCourt, the state judicial system should be permitted to\ncomplete its function undisturbed by premature interference\n7y the federal courts. Spielman Motor Sales  Co. v. Dodge,\n295 U.S. 89, 95-96 (1935); Fenner v. skin, 271 U.S. 240,\n244 (1926) .\n28/ C. F. Cleary v. Boyler, 371 U.S.'397 (19b3); Wilson v.\nnettler, 365 U.S. 381 (1961); Stefanelli v. Minardi 342\nU.S. 117 21951); Ponzi v. Fessenden, 258 U.S. 254+ (l922).\n\n- 31 -\nBut, as this Court stated in United States v.\nWood, 295 F. 2d 772, 779 (C.A. 5, 1961), \"the policy\nagainst interference with state criminal proceedings . . .\nis not one of statutory derivation.\" It is simply a rule\nof comity, \"not a rule distributing power as between the\nState and federal courts,\"(cid:9) v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391,\n425 (1963), and may at any time be abrogated by Congress.\nThis is precisely what was done when Congress enacted\nTitle II of the Civil Rights Act. Section 207(a) of the\n1964 Act provides:\nThe district courts of the United\nStates shall have jurisdiction of pro-\nceedings instituted pursuant to this\ntitle and shall exercise the same with-\nout regard to whether the aggrieved\nparty shall have exhausted any admini-\nstrative of other remedies that may be\nprovided by law.\nThis provision plainly and unambiguously removes\nTitle II cases from the ambit of the comity rule (for\nobvious reasons similar to those discussed in the preceding\nportion of this brief, su ra at pp. 16-19 ) .\nAny doubt that section 207(a) creates an exception\nto the rule of non-interference discussed in Jeannette\nwas removed by the decision of this Court in United States\nv. Wood, 295 F.2d 772 (C.A. 5, 1961). That case involved\na suit which, like the instant one, was brought to enjoin\n\n- 32 -\na pending criminal prosecution. The Wood opinion con-\nstrued section 131(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1957\n(42 U.S.C. 1971(d) which is virtually identical to\n29/\nsection 207(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as follows:\nThe court in this action is not\noperating under common-law equitable\nand discretionary doctrines, but under\na mandatory jurisdictional statute. As\nalready pointed out, the district court\nconsidered that it had jurisdiction over\nthis action but that such jurisdiction\nshould not be exercised to the extent of\nissuing the temporary restraining order.\nUnder the applicable jurisdictional sec-\ntion, we do not believe the court had\nthat choice.\nAfter quoting 42 U.S.C. 1971(d) the court continued\nFor several reasons, we hold that\nthis theory [ of non-interference with\nstate criminal proceedings set forth\nin Jeanette] is not applicable to the\npresent case.\nFirst, section 1971 creates a cause\nof action in the United States for\n\"preventive relief\" where a person has\nintimidated or has attempted to intimidate\nanother in the exercise of his right to\nvote. Where a federal statute has specif i-\ncally created a cause of action for_ preven-\ntive relief for intimidation, it may no\nlonger be said that this intimidation will\nnot be judicially recognized for the pur-\npose of establishing an equitable cause of\naction.\n29/ The statutes differ in two respects: (1) the 1957 Act\nstates: \"pursuant to this section\" while the 1964 Act states:\n\"pursuant to this title\";(2) where the 1957 Act speaks of the\n\"party aggrieved,\" the 1964 statute speaks of the \"aggrieved\nparty.\"\n\n- 33 -\nSecond, we believe that the affirma-\ntive defense of adequate state remedies\nhas been specifically removed by statute,\nfor subsection (d) expressly states that\nthe district court is to exercise juris-\ndiction without regard to whether the ag-\ngrieved party shall have exhausted other\nremedies provided by law. With this de-\nfense removed, there are no longer any\ngrounds for judicially ignoring that in-\ntimidation may exist in fact or that\nirreparable injury is not present.\nThe Wood opinion concluded by pointing out that\nits interpretation of section 1971(c) was \"in line with the\ndoctrine in other federal cases in this Circuit dealing\nwith the deprivation of constitutional rights on the basis\nof race or color.\" The Court noted that in Morrison v.\n30/\nDavis, 252 F. 2d 102 (C.A. 5, 1958), ! an injunctive action\n30/ In Morrison, this Court stated:\nWhatever may be the rule as to other threatened\nprosecutions, the Supreme Court in a case pre-\nsenting an identical factual issue affirmed the\njudgment of the trial court in the Browder case\n[Browder v. die, D.C.M. D. Ala., 1 1+ 2F. Supp.\n707, affirmed 1956, 352 U.S. 903] in which the\nsame contention was advanced. To the extent\nthat this is inconsistent with DouLlas v. City\nof Jeannett, Pa., 319 U.S. 157, 63 S.Ct. 877,\n87 L.Ed. 1324, we must consider the earlier\ncase modified.\nSee also Aelony v. Pace, No. 530 (M.D. Ga., Nov. 1, 1963)\n(unreported)) where Chief Judge Tuttle, writing for a three-\njudge court, granted an injunction forbidding prosecution of\nplaintiffs under Georgia insurrection and unlawful assembly\nstatutes: Anderson v. City of Albany, 321 F. 2d 649\n(C.A. 5, 1963); Bailey v. Patterson, 323 F. 2d 201\n(C.A. 5, 1963), cert. denied, 37^U.S. 910 (1964).\n\n-34-\n1\nbrought pursuant to 42 U.S.0  1983. Douglas v. Jeannette\nwas held to be inapplicable.\nIn short, Wood plainly holds that Jeannette is\ninapplicable to injunctive proceedings brought under a\n21\nmandatory jurisdictional statute such as 42  S.C. 1971\nor Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.If\n31/ It may also be said that, at least, in this Circuit,\nit is the rule that the Jeannette case is to be given \"a\nnarrow reading in civil rights cases,\" Dombrowski v. Pfister,\n227 F. Supp. 556, 583 (dissenting opinion of Judge Wisdom),\njurisd. noted, 377 U.S. 976 (1964).\n3?/ In cases analogous to the instant proceeding the equity\npowers of federal courts have also been invoked to entertain\na bill of peace to enjoin proceedings brought in state courts\nsolely for purposes of harassment. See Americ an Optometric\nAss'n v. Ritholz, 101 F 2d 883 (C.A. 7, 1939); Jamerson v.\nALli nce Ins. Co. of Philadelphia, 87 F. 2d 253 C.A. 7, 1937)\nwhich affirmed district court proceedings and held that the\npredecessor of 28 U.S.C. 2283 did not bar such relief. See\nalso Woodmen of the World v. O'Neil, 266 U.S. 292 (1924).\nProf essor Moore, in his \"Commentary on the U.S. Judicial\nCode,\" states that 28 U.S.C. 2283 permits such injunctive\nproceedings.\n\n- 35 -\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, it is suggested that\nthe order of the District Court be reversed.\nBURKE MARSHALL\nAssistant Attorney General,\nH.

This section \nwas later amended to make an exception for proceedings in bankruptcy. 36 Stat. at L. 1162, Chap. 231. The \nprovision, as amended, was carried forward as § 720 of the Revised Statutes (1874), § 265 of the Judicial Code \n(1911), and as 28 U.S.C.A. § 379 (1940). Section 2283 resulted from the revision of the Judicial Code in 1948. 62 Stat. \n968. The history of the section together with the exceptions which had been statutorily or judicially created to it are \nfully discussed by the Supreme Court in Toucey v. New York Life Insurance Company, 1941, 314 U.S. 118, 62 S.Ct. \n139, 86 L.Ed. 100; and Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America v. Richmond Brothers, supra; and in our cases of \nJacksonville Blow Pipe Company v. Reconstruction Finance Corp., 5 Cir. 1957, 244 F.2d 394; and T. Smith & Son, Inc. \nv. Williams, 5 Cir., 1960, 275 F.2d 397. \n \n2  A reason of some persuasion offered by the United States in an amicus brief for reading an exception into § 2283 is \n  that it does not apply where the United States is a party. Leiter Minerals, Inc. v. United States, 1957, 352 U.S. 220, \n77 S.Ct. 287, 1 L.Ed.2d 267. See also United States v. Wood, supra. Since § 204(a) of the 1964 Act provides for the \nintervention of the Attorney General in cases of the type under consideration, it would follow that Congress \nintended an exception to § 2283 in all cases. We need not rely on this argument to reach our conclusion. \n \n  4 \n \n\n3  This ground for affirmance is urged over and above § 2283. We have treated that section as not going to jurisdiction \n  but as being an affirmation by Congress of the rules of comity developed for our dual system of courts. T. Smith & \nSon, Inc. v. Williams, supra; and see Moore, Commentary on the Judicial Code, § .03(49), pp. 407-410, 1949. \n \n4  In the Morrison case, as in Douglas v. City of Jeanette, supra, an injunction was sought against threatened \n  prosecutions, rather than against prosecutions already commenced in the state courts. Therefore, § 2283 itself was \nnot applicable, see American Houses v. Schneider, 3 Cir., 1954, 211 F.2d 881, 44 A.L.R.2d 1352, and the only \nquestion was whether the injunction should be withheld on grounds of comity. \n \n5  The injunctive remedy which we here recognize as having been established by Congress is in addition to the remedy \n  afforded by removal of similar state court prosecutions under  28 U.S.C.A. § 1443(1). In either instance, the \nprosecutions are abated forthwith if the right to be free from punishment under § 203(c) is established. This right in \nturn depends on the right of equal access to public accommodations conferred by § 201(a) and arises when the right \nhas been peaceably or non-forcibly asserted. See Rachel v. State of Georgia, 5 Cir., 342 F.2d 336, March 5, 1965. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  5 \n ",
