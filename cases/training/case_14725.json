In such case,\nthe petition, having been filed within sixty days of the\nSecretary's action, is timely.\n\nAlabama's five welfare programs are outlined in\nthe District Court's decree granting the injunction (page\n83 of the printed record) and are as follows:\nSocial Security Act U.S.C.A.\nTitle I(cid:9) (Old Age Assistance and Title 42, § 301-306\nMedical Assistance to\nthe Aged)\n§\nTitle IV(cid:9) (Aid to Dependent Title 42, 601-606\nChildren - Alabama\nProgram)\nTitle V(cid:9) Part 3 (Child Welfare Title 42, § 721-728\nService)\n§\nTitle X(cid:9) (Aid to the Blind) Title 42, 1201-1206\n§\nTitle XIV (Aid to the Total and Title 42, 1351-1355\nPermanently Disabled)\nAs the Government concedes, there is no provision\nfor a judicial review of the cutting off of federal funds\nin connection with the program under Title V, Part 3, of\nthe Social Security Act, Title 42, Sections 721-728, Child\nWelfare Service, under Section 1316, Title 42. Thus, we\ncontend, this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain a\npetition to review the action of the Secretary as it re-\nlates to such a program, that a review under that program\nis within the exclusive jurisdiction of the District Court\n2\n\nunder the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 705\n(formerly Section 1009), a catch-all statute insuring a\nreview in a Federal Court of competent jurisdiction where\nno other method of review is provided by statute or where\nthe review provided by a statute is inadequate (necessari-\nly meaning in such case a District Court). We contend\nalso that the District Court has jurisdiction of the action\nfiled therein as to all the programs. These contentions\nwill be developed in the argument.\nOn motion of the State, this Court has entered\nan order consolidating the case made by the appeal from\nthe preliminary injunction order, No. 2446$, with the case\nmade by the State's petition, No. 24561, and therefore the\nwhole case is before this Court, entitling the parties to\na decision on the merits, under one procedure or the\nother, or both, in order that the issue may be fully\nsettled. With this the Government agrees, as we inter-\npret the brief of the Appellant-Respondent.\nIt would be well to point out to the Court that\nAlabama's welfare plan or plans on record with the Depart-\nment of Health, Education and Welfare were not introduced\n\nat the injunction hearing. Neither the original nor any\ncopy thereof has been filed at this writing as a part of\nthe record on appeal. They should be before this Court\nbecause official or judicial notice was taken thereof by\nthe hearing examiner at the administrative hearing on\nOctober 21, 1965. (See page 38, Volume I, Appendix to\nSecretary Gardner's Brief, page 17 of the transcript be-\n1\nfore the hearing examiner.  See also page 107 of the\nprinted record, particularly the statement of Mr. D. Robert\nOwen, Attorney, Department of Justice. 2) The plans are\nla \nIBMs YOURMAN:\" * * (Attorney, Office of the General\nCounsel, Department of Health, Education and Welfare) * *\n\"Mr. Hearing Examiner, we would like to take official notice\nof the plans for the public assistance program and for the\nchild welfare services which the State has filed and which\nare on file within the Department of Health, Education and\nWelfare and which are open there for public inspection.\nThis is made under Section 31.84 of the regulations.\"\n* * *\n\"MR. BARNES:\" * * (Alabama Department's Attorney) * *\n\"No objection, your Honor. I think it is understood, while\nit has not been brought in formally into evidence and they\nare available and will be treated as if they were in evidence.\"\n2„\nMR. OWEN: I wouldn't disagree with Mr. Barnes. They\ncould be noticed either in argument or briefs or whatever\nwas required. We could set out those portions that we\nwanted to show the Court.\"\n\npart of the administrative record.\nHad the petition case not been consolidated with\nthe injunction appeal case, or had the consideration of the\nappeal not been expedited, Secretary Gardner would undoubt-\nedly have filed a certified list of the entire administra-\ntive record, including the plans, with the Clerk of this\nCourt, as required by Section 2112, Title 28, U.S.C., in\nresponse to the petition (Fifth Circuit Rules 38-39).\nThe attorneys for both sides in this case agreed\nto cooperate with each other as far as possible in the\nexpedition of a hearing on these two cases and, recognizing\nthat it would be a less difficult task for the Alabama\nState Department to produce the papers and instruments\nrepresenting the plans, it was suggested to us by Owen\nFiss, Esq., Department of Justice, that the State might\nincorporate any parts of the plan in an appendix to the\nState's brief. However, upon reflection on our part, we\n(meaning the State) concluded that, since the Rules of\nthis Court require the transmission of the entire record\nto this Court, and apparently do not provide for substi-\ntution of an appendix for the original record, and because\n\nof the bulk of the plans, the originals should be filed\nwith the Court. The plans will be so offered as a part of\nthe original record and we ask leave that they be accepted\nas such.\nIt has proved to be difficult, as the State\nDepartment informs us, to reconstruct the plans to show\nas nearly as possible the essential documents on file with\nthe Federal Department at the time of the hearing in Octo-\nber of 1S65, as well as amendments since that time. Much\ntime has been consumed in such reconstruction, and this has\noccasioned delay in the submission of this brief in behalf\nof the State. We ask that the Court show us indulgence in\nthat regard. While the plans may not have been essential\nto a decision merely on the question whether a preliminary\ninjunction should have been granted, with the whole case\nnow before this Court under the consolidation of the\npetition with the appeal, the plans as a part of the admin-\nistrative record should be available for the Court's con-\nsideration.\nOther parts of the administrative record which\nhave not been included in the original record before the\n6\n\nCourt, or any reproduction thereof, are the State's motion\nfor postponement of the effective date of the action taken\nby the Secretary on January 12, 1967, cutting off federal\nfinancial assistance, transmitted to the Secretary by mail\non January 16, 1967, and the Secretary's action denying the\nmotion, all of which occurred before the setting of the case\nfor hearing in the United States District Court, Northern\nDistrict of Alabama, on application for a preliminary\ninjunction. This motion, as its content shows, was filed\nin accordance with Section 705, Title 5, U.S.C., the\nAdministrative Procedure Act, authorizing any department,\nofficer, or agency to stay such action pending judicial\ndetermination. We ask leave to file the motion and order,\nwhich are a part of the official record in Washington, as\na part of the record in this case, and we have reproduced\nthe motion in an appendix to this brief (we do not at\npresent have a copy of the denial). This appendix also\ncontains a reproduction of the petition filed in behalf of\nthe State, No. 24561.\nIt is important that the plans be a part of the\nrecord because, while the transcript of the administrative\n\nhearing in Washington, and the evidence taken therein, set\nforth in Volume I of the Brief of Appellant-Respondent,\nbriefly describe the five programs, the plans describe them\nin detail. For example, in that part of the volume which\nis characterized as the Manual for Administration of Public\nAssistance, Part 1, there is set forth on page IV-13 and on\nIV-14 a provision for regular payments directly to the wel-\nfare recipient by mail under four of the five programs,\nviz., Old Age Assistance (described under Alabama law and\nregulation as Old Age Pension), Aid to Dependent Children\n(ADC), Aid to the Blind (AB), and Aid to Permanently and\nTotally Disabled (APTD).\nSuch factors and details are significant. For\nexample, under the first of the above mentioned programs,\nthe Old Age Assistance, persons 65 years of age and over\nwho otherwise qualify with respect to residential and need\nrequirements (from the standpoint that they do not have the\nincome or sources sufficient for their support--the amount\ndetermined to be paid to each person is gauged by such\nstandards as are set forth in the plan) receive these pay-\nments directly without regard to the physical condition of\n\nsuch person. If there is no discrimination as between white\nand Negro recipients in determining eligibility, it would\nseem logical that under no condition should the federal funds\nwhich make up a substantial portion of these \"pensions\" be\ncut off. Yet all through the record of the administrative\nhearing, questioning by the Assistant General Counsel of\nHEW, there stands out an indication that if the employees\nof the State Department are not desegregated, in the sense\nthat a sufficient number of Negro employees interview white\nrecipients to determine eligibility and need, or vice versa,\nthis constitutes discrimination under the Civil Rights Act,\nthe regulation and HEW's interpretation thereunder (the\nsame situation exists as far as aid to dependent children\nis concerned).\nDirect payments of this nature made for aid to the\nblind, and to the totally and permanently disabled, can be\nmade only upon the determination of a physician, who certi-\nfies the condition of the recipient. As to these, it is\nclaimed by the officials of HEW, those who interpret and\nadminister the Civil Rights Act, that if the physician does\nnot have a desegregated waiting room or all desegregated\n\nfacilities, in making the examination (and only one may be\nrequired), there would be such discrimination if the Alabama\nDepartment made any payment to the physician as would vio-\nlate the Civil Rights Act, the regulation, and the assurance\nrequired to be signed by the State Department. This is an\nexample of the payments to third parties in order to pro-\nvide medical assistance to the aged, the blind, the dis-\nabled, and needy children, which the HEW regulation and the\nassurance form required to be signed proscribe.\nThese programs, according to the State plans, also\nprovide benefits, involving third party payments, which may\nbe outlined briefly as follows:\n(1) Title I, Social Security Act (Old Age\nAssistance and Uedical Assistance to the Aged), Title 42,\n§301-306, U.S.C.A Under this each eligible person over 65\nyears of age, in addition to direct payment or pension, may\nreceive medical assistance by way of hospitalization, for\na limited period (thirty days at the time of the administra-\ntive hearing in October, 1965), and post hospital limited\nmedical assistance for such limited period, upon certifi-\ncation by a physician of the beneficiary's choice. The\n- 10 -\n\nState paid (and now pays) the doctor for the examination\n($5), and also paid a limited amount for the hospitalization\n(this was before medicare), and now the State pays only $40\nfor those entitled to receive medicare (the deductible\namount under medicare), a substantial portion of all such\npayments being made up with federal funds. Also upon certi-\nfication of a physician that nursing home care was needed,\nthe patient would be placed in a licensed nursing home if\nrequested, the nursing home being paid by the State (in-\ncluding federal money). If the family preferred to take\ncare of the recipient, a payment would be made to the\n3\nrecipient for that purpose.  All hospitals and nursing\n3\nPertaining to the nursing home situation (the great\nmajority of the licensed nursing homes will accept only\nwhite patients, with only one accepting both races [Admini-\nstrative Hearing Transcript pages 94-95, 75; pages 115-116,\n96 of Appendix to Appellant-Respondent's Brief]) and the\nfamily situation, Commissioner Ruben King, Head of the\nState Department, testified in part:\n\"A No, I don't know how many were for colored. But I\nwant to say I know what your inference is, because of\nonly 13 colored nursing homes, as I stated to you.\nNow as I stated before, I know of no Negro who has\never applied for nursing home care that has not been\nable to get into a nursing home. And I think it is a\ncredit to the Negro race that they want to keep their\nold people at home, because we feel like in many\n\nhomes are licensed by the Health Department and not the\nAlabama Department of Pensions and Security. Payment for\nnursing home care is another example of payment to a third\nparty facility, which the Federal Department claims cannot\nbe used, however necessary, unless that facility is com-\npletely desegregated.\n(cont'd)\ncases, even in regards to whites, that these old people\nwould do better if they were in their own homes and were\nreceiving nursing care in their own homes instead of\nbeing in a nursing home.\nQ You say it would be equally better for whites also?\nA Yes, sir, I think it would be better in many cases. I\nthink that the nursing home care is growing at an\nalarming rate, not only in Alabama, but throughout this\nNation, and I think the Welfare agencies in this Nation\nought to concentrate on more people staying in their\nhomes and receiving nursing care in their homes. I\nthink that the people would probably live longer and\nI think it would be better for this country, certainly\ncheaper.\"\n* * *\n\"Q Mr. King, during your whole tenure, in your experience\nas the head of the State department, has there ever\nbeen an instance to your knowledge where a person of\nthe Negro race who is eligible to go into the nursing\nhome and who we will say who expressed a desire to go,\nhis family did, was there ever a failure to put them\nin there because there was no nursing facility?\nA No, sir. We have adequate bed facilities for Negroes\nin the State. I would like to point out again chat\nall of these are privately owned institutions. They\nare not run by the State, and if the need was there\nfor the Negro it would be met by private enterprise\njust like it had been in all other instances.\"\n- 12 -\n\n(2) Title IV, Social Security Act (Aid to Depen-\ndent Children - Alabama Program), Title 42, §631-606, U.S.C.A.\nThis involves only direct payments.\n(3) Title X, Social Security Act (Aid to the\nBlind), Title 42, 51201-1206, U.S.C.A. In addition to di-\nrect payments, nursing home care, or family care in the\nalternative, as above described, can be provided.\n(4) Title XIV, Social Security Act (Aid to the\nTotal and Permanently Disabled), Title 42, §1351-1355,\nU.S.C.A. Nursing dome care may be provided in addition\nto direct payments, with like certification and handling\nas above described.\nWith reference to the Child Welfare Service\nprogram, Title V, Part 3, Social Security Act, Title 42,\nU.S.C.A., 5721-728, this involves services to needy chil-\ndren essentially performed only by third parties. One of\nthese is placing the child in a child care institution,\nfor the most part church homes for children, maintained\nby various churches. It also involves third party ser-\nvices such as day care for children whose parent or\nparents are unable for any reason to take care of them\n- 13 °\n\nduring the day. These day care service functions are per-\nformed by private businesses, some of which accept only\nwhite children. As to the day care service, money is paid\nto the day care business (made up in substantial part by\nfederal money), but as to the child caring institutions\nsuch as the church homes, no money is paid to the insti-\ntution by the State, and no federal funds used, for the\ncare and housing of the child. The only federal money ex-\npended would be to pay salaries of case workers assisting\nin finding the child, determining the child's needs, and\nplacing the child in the institution. Mr. King, State\n4\nCommissioner, testified relative thereto.  (Pages 80-82\nof the Hearing Examiner's Transcript; pages 101-103 of the\nAppendix to Appellant-Respondent's Brief.)\n4\n\"A Well, they know, the Federal officials know as well as\nI do. And in the conference I have discussed with\nthem the thing that bothers us and that is particularly\nin the field of child care and institutions where no\nFederal money or State money is going to pay the money\nfor the care of our children and yet they tell us the\nmere fact that they pay half the salary of case work-\ners, of some social worker in the home, that these\nhomes must integrate. They start off on the premise\nthat a child is better off in an integrated--\nQ You are talking about the Federal officials?\n- 14 -\n\n(coned)\nA The Federal officials, particularly those in the child\nwelfare, start off on the premise that children do\nbetter in an integrated society and I disagree with\nthem.\nQ Let's take the institutions themselves. Now what are\nwe talking about?\nA We are talking about your Methodist homes, your Baptist\nhomes. We are talking about your Presbyterian homes,\nyour church homes. These people are not charging us\nunder the State plan one penny for taking care of our\nchildren and yet we have told the Federal officials\ntime and time again what is going to happen to these\nchildren if we have to integrate these facilities.\nOur job--and I want to say this, Mr. Barnes--my job\nas Welfare Commissioner is to see that the needy\npeople in the State of Alabama get help. And I want\nto know, and I would like to bring it out in this\nhearing today, I want to know whether or not the\nFederal Government is more interested in integration\nor seeing that needy people get help.\nI live down there with these people and I see the\npoor and hungry and the children that come in every\nday, in many cases who are half beaten to death and\nhave burns, and my interest is in that child and to\nsee that that child gets help. That is the reason\nI went to Montgomery. I am interested in those\nchildren.\nQ When you say child, you mean both white and Negro?\nA That's right.\nQ Do you have any, or do you have any Negro church\nhomes?\nA We have some that are serving families, yes, sir,\nNegro children.\nQ Do you also--\nA We have some who serve in both. We have some that\nserve only white and some that serve only Negro, and\nI believe we have some that serve both.\nQ Both?\nA Yes, sir.\nQ You are talking about in the State of Alabama?\nA In the State of Alabama.\"\n- 14a -\n\nThe Child Welfare Service program is the one per-\ntaining to which no provision is made under Section 1316,\nTitle 42, for review by a United States Court of Appeals,\nand the services performed involve purely payments to the\nthird party (as in payment to day care businesses), or only\npayment of the salaries to employees of the Department (in\ncase of placing children in church homes which charge the\nState Department nothing by way of state or federal money).\nOn the hearing for preliminary injunction, sev-\neral affidavits were introduced in behalf of the plaintiff,\nthe State, all of which are not shown in the reproduced\nrecord, but all of which are part of the original record\nin this Court. One affidavit, or a portion of one, demon-\nstrates that irreparable injury would result from the\ncutting off of Federal funds on page 101 of the printed\nrecord. There it appears that Federal funds actually ex-\npended at the end of the fiscal year prior to the hearing,\namounted to approximately $95,000,000, whereas State funds\namounting to approximately $31,000,000 during the same\nperiod were expended. The budget for the fiscal year to\n\nend September 30, 167, was approximately $103,300,000 of\nFederal funds and approximately $35,000,000 of State funds.\nAppearing in the exhibits and record, although\npossibly not in the printed or reproduced portion,  is the\nfact that approximately 200,000 persons in Alabama receive\nbenefits under Alabama's welfare programs.\nqUESTIONS PRESENTED\nQuestions presented involve the validity of the\nregulations of the Department of Health, Education and\nWelfare together with, and also separately from, the valid-\nity of the requirement of the assurance required to be\ngiven by the State Department (page 158, 158a, Vol. I,\nAppendix to Appellant-Respondent's Brief), Form CB-FS 5022\ncontaining, particularly with reference to Section 4 of\nsuch form (as well as the regulation)(cid:9) a guaranty.\nthat the third parties whose services are utilized and are\nnecessary to be utilized, such as physicians, nursing\nhomes, day care centers, church homes, will be completely\ndesegregated.\nRelated to such questions is the question whether\nthe regulation and/or the assurance are consistent with the\n- 16 -\n\nobjectives of the Act or Acts under which Federal funds are\nallocable for the benefit of thousands of poor, needy and\nindigent persons, both white and Negro.\nAnother question presented is whether the Secre-\ntary had the authority to cut off the funds at all and\nwhether the Department of Health, Education and Welfare\nshould have passed regulations which would have afforded\nthe Department or the Government \"other legal means\" (words\nused in the Civil Rights Act of 1S64) for preventing dis-\ncrimination, before putting into effect any cut-off pro-\ncedure (to be used only as a last resort).\nThere are, of course, the jurisdictional points\ninvolving the question as to which court has a right of\nreview of all of the programs involved.\nThe matters out of which these questions arose\nhave been pointed out and the point will be discussed.\nSPECIFICATIONS OF ERROR\nThe Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare\nerred in taking the action, and rendering the decision, of\nJanuary 12, 1967, directing the cutting off and\n- 17 -\n\ndiscontinuance of Federal financial assistance from the\nDepartment of Pensions and Security of the State of Alabama,\nfor the following reasons, separately and severally:\n(1) Said action of the Secretary transcends the\nauthority given him, or the Department of Health, Education\nand Welfare, under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n(2) Said action transcends the regulations of\nthe Department of Health, Education and Welfare.\n(3) The regulations of the Department of Health,\nEducation and Welfare in the respect involved in said action\nwere not consistent with the objectives of the act or acts\nproviding financial assistance.\n(4) Requiring the cutting off of said financial\nassistance was not consistent with the objectives of the\nact or acts providing for such financial assistance.\n(5) Requiring the assurance or guaranty that\nthird parties would desegregate all of their facilities\nwas not consistent with the objectives of the act or acts\nproviding financial assistance.\n(6) Cutting off of Federal funds for direct pay-\nments to beneficiaries was not warranted.\n- 18 -\n\nARGUMENT\nWe think it in order to discuss first'thaquestion\nof the validity of that portion of the Federal Regulation,\n45 C.F.R. 30.3, which is contained under (b), and which is\nset out in part on page 4(22 of the printed record and the\nvalidity of that portion of the form which is set out on\npage 50 of the printed record, with particular reference\nto the requirement of an assurance that the State agency\nwill take such steps as necessary to assure that any other\nagency, institution or organization participating in the\nprogram through contractual or other arrangements, will\ncomply with the act and regulation. The validity vel non\nof the requirement of such an assurance relates principally\nto that portion of Section 602, Title 6, of the Civil\nRights Act contained in the first sentence thereof as\nfollows:\nSec. 602. Each Federal department and agency\nwhich is empowered to extend Federal financial\nassistance to any program or activity, by way\nof grant, loan, or contract other than a con-\ntract of insurance or guaranty, is authorized\nand directed to effectuate the provisions of\n- 19 -\n\nSec. 601 with respect to such program or activ-\nity by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of\ngeneral applicability which shall be consistent \nwith achievement of the objectives of the \nstatute authorizing the financial assistance \nin connection with which the action is taken.\nThe pertinent portion of the form, DB-FS-5022 is as follows\n(Page 158 B, Appendix to the Secretary's Brief):\n4. Other Agencies. Institutions Or•anizations\nand Contractors \nThe State agency will take such steps as\nnecessary to assure that any other agency,\ninstitution or organization participating\nin the program, through contractual or\nother arrangements, will comply with the \nAct and Regulation. [Emphasis ours]\nThis involves the third party payment question,\none of the primary issues by the parties in this case.\nIn pinpointing the objections for the State agency\nto sign a form including this section (the section we con-\nstrue--and it would be hazardous for us to construe it\notherwise--as containing in effect a guaranty that private\nphysicians and/or private nursing homes and/or private\ninstitutions assuming the care of children [such as church\nhomes] will completely integrate themselves), we introduced\nevidence through the State Department's sole witness, Mr.\nRuben King, the Commissioner, at the administrative\n- 20 -\n\nhearing, that private physicians have rendered and are\nrendering treatment to Negroes as well as white people,\ngiving them all the same treatment, and even providing\nplaces for them to sit, but that many private practitioners\n(who receive only $5.00 per person) have refused to deseg-\nregate their waiting rooms and that in some counties, to\nsay the least, where there was only one doctor (a white\ndoctor), this would deprive the needy poor people of exami-\nnation if as a condition to such treatment there must be a\ndesegregated waiting room so that the poor sick people\nmight be able to socialize while they are waiting for ser-\nvice.\nPertinent portions of the evidence given by Mr.\nKing on the physician aspect of the case are set out both\nin the printed record and the Appendix to the Secretary's\nBrief (Printed record, pp. 51-53, Hearing Transcript pp.\n76-80, Appendix to Appellant-Respondent's Brief, Vol. I,\npp. 76-80).\nPertinent excerpts from the evidence pertaining\nto the placing of children in church homes in the Child\nWelfare Services program have been set out in footnote in\n- 21 -\n\nthe Statement of the Case. The situation pertaining to\nother third party services (commonly referred to as vendor\nservices) has been described, such as the use of nursing\nhomes and day care centers.\nConcerning institutional care, the Government's\nchief witness at the administrative hearing stated the\nposition of the Government in the interpretation of the\nregulation and the assurance form required as follows (Miss\nMargaret A. Emery, Vol. I, Appendix to the Secretary's\nBrief, pp. 68-69):\n\"Q Then, in such a case, has the Department\ninterpreted it this way and so instructed\nthe states that the institution must agree\nor desegregate even though it does not re-\nceive any federal funds whatsoever?\nA Whether or not the institution is receiving\nfederal funds directly or indirectly is not\nthe determining factors as to whether the\nstate agency must require compliance under\nTitle VI of the Act.\nFor example, if the children that are\nbeing placed by the state welfare depart-\nment had been placed by the court in the\ncustody of the state welfare department,\nthen the state welfare department is re-\nsponsible for providing to those children\nservices whereby there will be no dis-\ncrimination in their treatment. And if\nthe state, under those circumstances,\n-22-\n\nwould not be able to use an institution\nwhich was completely segregated, it would\nbe responsible for assuring compliance in\nall situations of the children who --\nQ You mean even though the state in its plan\ndid not pay out any federal money to the\ninstitution?\nA That is correct. As I said, as an illus-\ntration I am using the children who are\nin the legal custody of the state welfare\ndepartment.\"\nThe Federal Department's position pertaining to\nthe meaning of the regulation and the assurance form on\nthe physician aspect is illustrated by the testimony of\nMiss Emery as follows (Appendix, Vol. I, pp. 64 and 78):\n\"Q May I ask if any of the discussions with\nwhich you are familiar, whether you heard\nit discussed or stated to the representa-\ntives of state departments, in any way,\nthat for example under the assurance that\nwe have given to take such steps as\nnecessary to make the institution or\nagencies or persons applying, it has been\nstated that for example the doctor must\nhave a desegregated waiting room.\nA Have I heard that stated; is that your\nquestion?\nQ Yes, ma'am.\nA Yes.\nQ All right.\n-23-\n\nA This is also stated in writing, but wherever\nthe state plan provides for use of private\nphysicians, the private physician -- and\nthis is true in many states -- the private\nphysician must give the state agency assur-\nance that there will be no discrimination\nin the treatment and the services provided\nto recipients of public assistance funds.\nQ That has been interpreted even to segre-\ngated waiting rooms?\nA Those are included as being within the pm-\nview of the Act.\"\n* * *\n\"A . . . But my understanding is that many\nstates would prefer to let the individual\nrecipient choose the physician or the\narrangement for the medical care that he\nwished to use, but when he does that the\nphysician is under the p'.rview of Title VI\nand the Department regulations, if that\narrangement is included in the state plans\nfor public assistance.\"\nPertaining to the refusal to sign the form previ-\nously referred to and shown by the record, contained in the\n\"Handbook\", the State Department's position is shown on\npage 92 (Secretary's Appendix) in the testimony of\nCommissioner King on the administrative hearing:\n\"A We stated -- I stated to several Federal\nofficials that we were willing to sign a\ncompliance, that we would comply with the\nCivil Rights Act, that the State of\n- 24 -\n\nAlabama, and I as Commissioner, would\nhave a right to interpret, that as\nCommissioner I had as much right to inter-\npret whether or not the rules and regu-\nlations were within the intent and scope\nof the law as some official here in\nWashington.\nQ You made a statement of what you stated,\nwhat you were willing to sign. Are you\nstill willing to sign?\nA We are still willing to sign a statement\nthat we are willing to comply with the law.\nQ You are talking about the Civil Rights\nAct of 1965?\nA Yes, sir.\"\nThere has never been a statement by the Government\nthat such an assurance would be sufficient and the differ-\nence between what the Government absolutely required and\nwhat the State agency was willing to do involves a princi-\npal issue.\nThe Government in its brief appears to take the\nposition that the form does not contain a rigid assurance,\nand gives the impression that all that it intends to do is\nto require the State to do the best that it can. We sub-\nmit that while there is no time limit set, the assurance\nthat the State agency will take such steps as is \"necessary\"\n-25-\n\nto assure compliance by third parties is at leas:: a commit-\nment that all segregation of every service, as interpreted\nby the Federal Department, on the part of third parties will\nend within a reasonable time. That this is true is clearly\ndemonstrated by the testimony of Miss Emery on the hearing\nin Washington where she says, having referred previously to\nthe 'Handbook\" and the regulation (pp. 43 and 44, Appendix\nto Secretary's Brief):\n\"A This is correct. The state plan material\nis required to set forth the situation in\nthe state, and the state plan and time\nlimit, the purpose of that and the other\nregulation was to provide assurance that \nwithin a reasonable time the state would \nnot only take steps it would accomplish\ncompliance with the Civil Rights Act, but\nthere is no specific deadline set forth\nin the regulations nor in the handbooks\nof the two bureaus.\" [Emphasis ours]\nIt appears to us that the Government should not\ninsist upon such a guaranty (which might well be construed\nas a contractual one and upon which action might later be\nbrought) that all private practitioners upon whom the State\nagency must rely, must agree to administer integrated ser-\nvices of all classes (in the case of physicians to inte-\ngrate them in waiting rooms), as long as equal services\n- 26 -\n\nare administered from an equal source (as the evidence\nshows in the case). Then, in the future, if it should be\ncharged or determined that services are not available for\nNegroes as well as whites, a case might be made for the\ncutting off of funds in that particular activity, program\nor part thereof. Until that time arrives, there should be\nno determination of non-compliance, with the necessary\neventual cutting off of funds, merely because HEW insists\nupon a particular form (the writer has on occasion charac-\nterized this insistence as the law of the Medes and the Per-\nsians which altereth not).\nUndoubtedly the question will occur: What differ-\nence does it make whether the State agency signs a form\nwhich includes the guaranty? Let us illustrate the differ-\nence: If the State agency signs a form giving assurance\nthat it eventually will bring physicians upon which it is\nforced to depend, into subjection, and it fails to do so\n(no matter at what time), then it has violated the assur-\nance, no matter how hard it may have tried. No one at\nthis point can say but what the violation of the assurance\nis contractual and, if this is true, the Government might\n-27-\n\nelect to recover from the State agency all of the federal\nmoney pre-advanced to the State agency for the treatment\nof old people, between the time of the signing of the\nassurance and the time when it may be finally determined\nthat the State agency is unable to bring the doctors into\nCI\ncompliance\".\nSuch would be a far more drastic step than the\nmere cutting off of future funds. The State agency wants\na situation to exist where it is required only to do its\nbest and, in the event of future failure in good faith,\nit could be subjected at most only to the future cutting\noff of funds and not the imposition of sanctions for money\nalready received and expended. This appears to us to be\na valid and substantial difference, and it matters not\nwhat other states or other agencies may have signed. Our\nState agency has a right to insist upon its rights and\nupon equitable treatment.\nWe, therefore, contend that requiring such an\nassurance transcends the Civil rights Act itself.\nWhile §601 of Title VI provides generally that\nno person shall on the ground of race, color or national\n-28-\n\norigin be excluded from participation in, denied the bene-\nfits of, or subjected to discrimination under any program\nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance, §602\nprescribes a limitation upon that general directive or at\nleast a clarification as to what might be considered dis-\ncrimination under particular circumstances.\nWhile §602 confers upon such Federal Department\nor agency empowered to extend for Federal financial assis-\ntance under any act the authority to execute the provisions\nof §601 by issuing rules, regulations and orders of general\napplicability, it is further prescribed that such regu-\nlations, etc., \"shall be consistent with the achievement \nof the objectives of the statute authorizing financial \nassistance in connection with which the action is taken\".\n[Emphasis ours]\nThere is a further limitation, in speaking of the\ntermination or refusal of funds, that \"such termination\nor refusal shall be limited to the particular political\nentity or part thereof, or other recipient\" against whom\na finding has been made and also \"shall be limited in its\neffect to the particular program or part thereof, in which\n-\n\nsuch non-compliance has been so found.\"\nWe urge, for example, that requiring a doctor to\nhave a desegregated waiting room, as long as he otherwise\ntreats all patients alike, is not consistent with the\nachievements of the objectives of the Social Security Act\nunder which the Welfare programs are administered, and\nshall quote from the Congressional Record an analogous\nsituation in order to demonstrate our contention.\nFirst, however, let us make sure that we are\ncorrect in this example (desegregation of waiting rooms)\nas being embraced within the scope of the guaranty re-\nquired of the State agency under §4 of the form. That\nthis construction has been placed upon the assurance re-\nquired or upon its regulation is shown in the testimony\nof the witness for the Government (HEW), Miss Margaret A.\nEmery, heretofore referred to.\nWe think it elementary to state that the con-\nstruction placed by the administrative department or\nagency upon the regulations which it has promulgated and\nwhich it seeks to administer, will be given great weight\nin the interpretation of such regulations.\n- 30 -\n\nThere is another question involved and that  is\nthat although the Civil Rights Act provides that the with-\nholding of financial assistance or the cutting off thereof\nshall be limited to the particular program or activity or,\npart thereof (see the Act itself) in which the discrimi-\n5\nnation is practiced,  the assurance required by HEW may\nwell be and probably will be construed as applying to all\nof the programs of a particular state agency or at least\na complete program (as distinguished from a part thereof),\n5\nConcerning that part of §602 which provides that the\ntermination or refusal of assistance shall be limited in\nits effect to the particular program or part thereof in\nwhich such non-compliance has been found, Senator Javits\nsaid [p. 62 BNA, \"Civil Rights Act of 1964\"]:\n\"Let me give the Senator an example, because we dis-\ncussed the question in great detail. We discussed in\ngreat detail the situation in which a contractor on Gov-\nernment work -- that is, work in which the United States\nputs up some of the money. Assume he is a road contrac-\ntor and was discriminating in his business against hiring\nNegroes, but he was not discriminating on that particular\njob.\nI state for the RECORD that because he was discrimi-\nnating generally, but was not discriminating on that job,\nwe could not cut off his funds because the statute which\npermitted the Federal Government to put up its share of\nthe money did not apply to the contractor's general\nbusiness operations. It applied only to the construction\nof the road.\" [Emphasis ours]\n- 31 -\n\nThis is a secondary contention on our part but nevertheless\nis what we conceive to be a substantial one. Relative to\nthat question, we point to the testimony of Miss Emery on\nre-direct examination (pp. 72, 73, Appendix to Appellant-\nRespondent's Brief):\ny Similarly, if a state submitted a state-\nment of compliance which is adequate for\npurposes of meeting the requirements with\nrespect to, let's say, the child welfare\nservices under Title V, Part 3, of the\nSocial Security Act, the fact that it\ndidn't submit such a statement with respect\nto its public assistance programs would be\nimmaterial as far as receiving child wel-\nfare services grants?\nMR. BARNES: We think that is an inter-\npretation. We object to it. They are\ntalking about the assurance would have to\nbe given.\nHEARING EXAMINER IRWIN: If that is the\nobjection, I will overrule it.\nMR. YOURJYIAN: Would you answer the\nquestion?\n(The reporter read the question.)\nTHE WITNESS: This is correct in some\nsituations. For example, in certain\nstates the child welfare program is\nadministered by a separate agency and\nthere is a separate statement. The\nusual pattern is where the programs \nare administered by the same agencies\n- 32-\n\nyou have one Civil Rights branch which \nis applicable to both child welfare and\npublic assistance.\" [Emphasis ours]\nThis is all that we will say concerning this\nsecondary contention (important as the question is) and\nwe return to the discussion of respondents' primary posi-\ntions.\nAs stated, §602 of the Civil Rights Act, the pro-\nvision of Title VI which empowers the defendants to issue\nrules and regulations, provides expressly that any such\nrules, regulations or orders issued \"shall be consistent \nwith achievement of the objectives of the statute autho-\nrizing the financial assistance in connection with which\nthe action is taken.\" [Emphasis ours] It was for the\nspecific purpose of prohibiting the issuance of regula-\ntions which would apply to authorize the withholding of\nfinancial assistance under, for example, programs for\nfurnishing lunches for school children that the above\nquoted provision was included in this act. This is shown\nvery clearly by the following statement of Senator Pastore\n(the floor leader in the Senate for Title VI)at p. 13936\nof the Congressional Record of June 19, 1964:\n-33-\n\n\"Let me advise Senators that the failure of a\ndistrict court to desegregate the schools will not\njeopardize the school lunch program; it absolutely\nwill not. Even if a community does not desegregate,\nthat will not jeopardize the school lunch program--\nunless in that particular school the white children \nare fed, but the black children are not fed; and I\nrefer Senators to page 33 of the bill, which states\nvery, very clearly: 'which shall be consistent'--\nin other words, the orders and rules -- 'shall be\nconsistent with the achievement of the objectives\nof the statute authorizing financial assistance.'\n\"We have a school lunch program, and its pur-\npose is to feed, not to desegregate the schools;\ntherefore, that would not be consistent. But if a\nschool district did not desegregate, it could no\nlonger get federal grants, let us say, to build a\ndormitory -- not unless it integrated; and a hos-\npital could not receive 50 percent of the money\nwith which to build a future addition unless it\nallowed all American citizens who are taxpayers\nand who produce the tax funds that would be used\nto build the addition, to have access to the hos-\npital.\n\"So we must remember that the shutting-off of \na grant must be consistent with the objectives to \nbe achieved. A school lunch program is for the \npurpose of feeding the school children. If the\nwhite children are fed, but the black children \nare not fed that is a violation of this law.\"\n[Emphasis ours]\nThis statement demonstrates what Congress meant\nby the term \"discrimination\" -- that in the use of that\nterm in §601 of the Act, it was intended only that all\nchildren should be entitled to the benefits of the school\nlunch program, not to cause the \"desegregation\" of the\n-34-\n\nschools in which funds received under such programs are\nused. It is evident that the use of the word \"discrimi-\nnation\" in Title VI was used selectively.\nIf, as the floor leader for Title VI said (Senator\nPastore), the act when applied to feeding children in school\ncontemplated merely that all the children be fed, Negro and\nwhite, and in essence that the word \"discrimination\" as\nused in the act did not require that the children be inte-\ngrated while being fed, then we do not see how the act can\nbe construed as requiring that there be a mingling together\nin waiting rooms, or in nursing homes, or in institutions\nassuming the care of children. The purpose of these pro-\ngrams is to treat the sick, and to care for the poor, and\nso long as the treatment and care are provided for all,\nthen there is no discrimination under such program within\nthe meaning of the Civil Rights Act. Thus, the assurance\nrequired, the guaranty, in effect, that there must be ab-\nsolutely desegregated waiLia;rooms or nursing homes or\ninstitutions for child care, goes beyond the scope of the\nCivil Rights Act.\n-35 -\n\nWe next quote from Senator Saltonstall of\nMassachusetts:\n\"Furthermore, it is important to note that\nsection 602 states that any rules or regu-\nlations established to effectuate the pro-\nvisions of this title 'shall be consistent\nwith achievement of the objectives of the\nstatute authorizing the financial assistance.'\nThus, where Federal funds are used to feed\nneedy children through a program which is\noperated on a segregated basis, this section \ndoes not intend that the children be de-\nprived of the food because the administrators \nof the program are violating the law. How-\never, we cannot justify the expenditure of\nFederal funds collected from all citizens\non programs which are being administered in\na way which clearly deprives some of them\nof the equal protection of the laws.\"\n[Underscoring supplied]\n(110 Con. Rec.--Senate, Number 11, page 12263)\nSenator Saltonstall was, as we understand it, the\nChairman of the Bi-Racial Senate Conference whipping the\nfinal version of the substitute into effect, as finally\npassed, and made the above statement shortly before the\npassage. This statement, we submit, is entitled to great\nweight.\nWe also quote from Senator Ribicoff:\n\"The remedies provided by section 602 are with-\nholding of assistance and any other means\n- 36 -\n\nauthorized by law. In general, the consistent-\nwith-the-objectives requirement would make\nwithholding of funds a last resort, to be used\nonly when other means authorized by law were\nunavailable or ineffective.\n\"To make that clear: The withholding of funds\nwould be the last step to be taken only after\nthe administrator or the agency had used every\nother possible means to persuade or to in-\nfluence the person or the agency offending to\nstop the discrimination.\n\"Seventh. Looking first to the 'other means \nauthorized by law,' the agency could, for\nexample, ask the Attorney General to initiate\na lawsuit under Title IV, if the recipient\nwere a school district or public college; or\nthe agency could use any of the remedies avail-\nable to it by virtue of its own 'rule, regu-\nlation, or order of general applicability.'\nFor example, the most effective way for an\nagency to proceed would often be to adopt a\nrule that made the nondiscrimination require-\nment part of a contractual obligation on the\npart of the recipient. Then violation of such\na requirement would normally give the agency\nthe right to bring a lawsuit to enforce its\nown contract; or, in the absence of a techni-\ncal contract, the agency would have authority \nto sue to enforce compliance with its own \nregulations. All of these remedies have the\nobvious advantage of seeking to end the dis-\ncrimination, rather than to end the assistance.\"\n[Underscoring supplied]\n(110 Con. Rec. 6846-6847, daily ed., April 7,\n1964)\nThese examples, statements from responsible\nleaders of the Senate, illustrate that the cutoff of funds\n-37-\n\nin cases of this kind, where innocent people will suffer by\nreason thereof, is a last resort; and Senator Ribicoff in-\ndicates that the Federal agency could and should adopt a\nregulation affording a remedy against discrimination and\nforcing a State agency, if accepting funds, to desist\nfrom any discrimination complained of, prior to the cutting\noff of funds. The Civil Rights Act applies to every form\nof financial assistance by way of grant, loan or contract.\nFor example, if a contractor with the Government practiced\ndiscrimination, the Federal agency involved might termi-\nnate the contract and cut off the funds, without being\ncompelled to use other means. However, it is not con-\nsistent with the objectives of the Social Security Act\nthat aid be withheld from those who do not have anything\nto do with compliance, such as the white and Negro bene-\nficiaries. Thus, the beneficiaries should not be victim-\nized and excluded from the aid which the law intended they\nshould have.\nThus, for example, a regulation or action which\nauthorizes or directs the cutting off of all funds merely\nbecause the State agency refuses to sign a guaranty that\n-38-\n\na private physician who declines to desegregate his waiting\nroom will not be chosen for an initial service in certi-\nfying a beneficiary as eligible for aid, is not consistent\nwith the intent of the Social Security Act.\n\nJURISDICTION OF THE DISTRICT COURT \nIn support of District Court's jurisdiction, the\nappellees. are invoking the provisions of the second\nsentence of Section 603 of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964, which provides: \"in the case of agency, not\notherwise subject to judicial review, terminating or\nrefusing to grant or to continue financial assistance\nupon a finding of failure to comply with any require-\nment imposed pursuant to Section 602, any person\naggrieved (including any state or political subdivision\nthereof and any agency of either) may obtain judicial\nreview of such action in accordance with Section 10 of\nthe Administrative Procedure Act ... H. We acknowledge\nthat by an amendment to the Social Security Act in 1965,\nreview in the Court of Appeals was provided for deter-\nminations of discontinuation of financial assistance\nunder certain programs. This amendment, codified as 42\nU.S.C., Section 1316, provides for such review in the\nCourt of Appeals for determinations under Sections 304,\n604, 1204, 1354, 1384 and 1396c of 42 U.S.C. However,\nno provision was made for review by the Court of Appeals\n\nof determinations with respect to funds provided under\nSubchapter V of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.\nSections 704-731, providing for grants to states for\nmaternal and child welfare. The state agency adminis-\nters programs under part 3 of Subchapter V of the Social\nSecurity Act and a determination was made by the Secre-\ntary of HEW to terminate payment of funds under this\nsubchapter as well as others.\nSince no review in the Court of Appeals is pro-\nvided for determinations and terminations of payments to\nstates under Subchapter V of the Act, the only court in\nwhich plaintiffs can secure review with respect to the\ntermination of child welfare funds is in the district court.\nThis is because, of course, the Courts of Appeal have no\ngeneral original jurisdiction as do the district courts\nand the only jurisdiction which they have to review\nagency action is that which is \"specifically conferred\nby legislation relating specifically to the determina-\ntions of such agency.\" AF of L v. N.L.R.B., 308 U.S.\n401,404; City of Dallas v. Rentzel, 172 F.2d 122 (5th\nCir. 1949).\n\nThere is no doubt, therefore, that the Dis-\ntrict Court has jurisdiction by virtue of Section 603\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Administrative\nProcedure Act with respect to the administration of\nprograms under Subchapter V of the Social Security Act\nrelating to child welfare.\nIt is the position of the State that the Admin-\nistrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.X. Section 1009, which is\nthus made applicable by the provisions of Section 603 of\nthe Civil Rights Act, provides under the circumstances\nexisting here for jurisdiction in the District Court of\nthe entire suit of the plaintiffs. Subsection (b) of\nSection 1009 provides in pertinent part that the form\nof proceeding for judicial review of agency action is by\nft\nany special statutory review proceeding(cid:9) in any court\nspecified by statute or, in the absence or inadequacy \nthereof, any applicable form of legal action(cid:9) in any\ncourt of competent jurisdiction.\" In order for a legal\nremedy provided by statute to be \"adequate\" within the\nrecognized meaning of that term, such remedy must be able\n\nto afford relief for the entire case presented by the\nplaintiffs. As stated in analogous context in\nHillsborough TP v. Cromwell, 326 U.S. 620,629 (1946):\n\"A remedy at law cannot be considered\nadequate so as to prevent equitable\nrelief, unless it covers the entire\ncase made by the bill in equity.\"\nSince the Court of Appeals has and could require no\noriginal jurisdiction under the child welfare program\nportion of the appellees' case, and since the only\ncourt in which a stay of the agency action in regard\nto such program and any determination of the invalidity\nof the agency action in that respect is the District\nCourt under the Administrative Procedure Act, the statu-\ntory review provided for in the Court of Appeals is\nplainly inadequate since it does not cover the entire\ncase made by the plaintiffs' complaint. Therefore, and\nalso following the action of the Supreme Court in\nHillsborough v. Cromwell, supra, the District Court has\nthe authority and power under the Administrative Proce-\ndure Act to exercise its concurrent jurisdiction by\nassuming jurisdiction over the entire case (including\n\nthose programs for which review is provided in the Court\nof Appeals) in order to afford to the plaintiffs adequate\nand complete relief. For, as n•ted in Elmo Division of \nDrive-X Co. v. Dixon, 348 Fad 42,343 (D.C. Cir. 1965),\n\"statutory provisions concernin: review of agency action\nby the Courts of Appeals do not in and of themselves\npreclude district court jurisdi tion\" when only the\ndistrict court can provide an e fective and adequate\nremedy.\nThis is also true wit respect to the claim\nof the individual plaintiffs re •resenting the class of\nAlabama recipients of funds, ad•ed by the second amend-\nment to the complaint (Printed ecord, page 70).\nThe Government argues that the fact that the\nadministration of the Child Welfare Service program is\nso intertwined with the other .rograms, especially the\naid for Dependent Children sh•id operate to confer\njurisdiction upon this Court o a direct review of the\naction in respect to that program as well. Patently,\nthis cannot confer jurisdictio where none is granted by\nstatute. The fact that they a e intertwined augments the\n\nposition that the review in the Court of Appeals is\ninadequate, that a review in one Court of the entire\naction is the only adequate review, and this alone\nshould serve to relegate jurisdiction to the District\nCourt. However, as stated, the whole case is before\nthis Court in all events.\nRespectfully submitted,\nREID B.

Administrative Proceedings\nLeA414 A\nThe regulation(cid:9) '(cid:9) the Departme t of Health,\nEducation and Welfare of the\nlitis4 0...k &\ncivil Rights Acbecame effective on December 3,\n40•AL\ntt (.6d.\n1964(cid:9) , after(cid:9) by the President.\nik\n42 U.S.C. §2006d-1.----\nThe affected programs (and their statutory\nbases) are the following: Old Age Assistance, Title I\nof the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§301-306; Aid\nto Needy Families, Title IV, 42 U.S.C. §§601-609;\nChild Welfare Services, Title V, part 3, 42 U.S.C.\n§§721-728; Aid to the Blind, Title X, 42 U.S.C.\n§§1201-1206: and Aid to the Permanently and Totally\nDisabled, Title XIV, 42 U.S.C. §§1351-1355.\n\nThe regulation contains a general prohibition against\ndiscrimination, on the ground of race, color or\nnational origin, in programs of federal assistance\nadministered by HEW. Under section 80.3 of the regu-\nlation, recipients of federal financial aid are prohibited\nfrom engaging \"directly or through contractual or other\narrangements\" in certain specific discriminatory actions\nand in the use of methods of administration which have\nthe effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination\nbecause of their race, color, or national origin. Sec-\ntion 80.4(b) requires that every application by a state\nagency to carry out a program involving continuing federal\nfinancial assistance covered by the regulation contain:\n.(cid:9) . a statement that the program is(cid:9) . .\nconducted in compliance with all requirements\nimposed by. . . [the regulation], or a state-\nment of the extent to which it is not, at the\ntime the statement is made, so conducted, and\n(2) provide or be accompanied by provision\nfor such methods of administration for the\nprogram as are found by the responsible\nDepartment official to give reasonable\nassurance that the applicant and all recipients\nof Federal financial assistance under such\n\ncould not be obtained by voluntary means. Pursuant\nto §602 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Dr. Winston\noffered the Alabama Department an opportunity for a\nhearing with respect to the question of its compliance\nwith the regulation ((cid:9) ).\nOn August 20, 1965, Ruben K. King, Commissioner\nof the Alabama Department, sent to Dr. Winston a letter\nwhich he described as a \"statement of . . . compliance\nwith Title VI. . . .\" Commissioner King's letter stated\nthat the Alabama Department was in full conformity with\nthe 1964 Act regarding determination of eligibility for\naid and the amount of aid. His letter indicated that in\nsome local offices segregated facilities existed and\nthat various institutions, organizations, and contractors\nfrom which the Alabama Department obtained services\nfollowed a policy of segregation. However, Commissioner\nKing expressed the basic view that his Department had no\nauthority to control the practices of physicians or of\nthe hospitals, nursing homes, and other institutions\n\nOn August 27, 1965, HEW replied to Commissioner\nKing's letter and informed him that the statement of\ncompliance which he had submitted was not adequate\n). It was pointed out, for example, that the\na\nstatement did not indicate methods which woula be used\nby the Alabama Department to correct existing discrimi-\nnation.\nAn evidentiary hearing to determine Alabama's\ncompliance with the regulation was held on October 21,\n1965, before Hearing Examiner Robert L. Irwin ((cid:9) ).\nCommissioner King testified on behalf of the Alabama\nDepartment ((cid:9) On April 5, 1966, the hearing examiner\nissued a decision recommending that the Commissioner of\nWelfare terminate federal financial assistance1 under\nTitles I, IV? V (part 3), X andXIV of the Social Security\nAct1to the State of Alabama ((cid:9) ). This decision,\nsubject to certain modifications, was adopted by\nCommissioner Winston on November 16, 1966 ((cid:9) ). On\nJanuary 12, 1967, Secretary John W. Gardner approved\nthe Commissioner's decision and ordered the termination\n\nof aid to the State of Alabama. 1 Secretary Gardner\nfound noncompliance on the part of the Alabama\nDepartment in the following respects: failure to\nmake an adequate commitment to assure nondiscriminatory\noperation of its federally aided welfare programs even\nin those parts which involved direct payments from the\nAlabama Department to beneficiaries; refusal to accept\nany responsibility for assuring that third parties to\nwhom it provides services or whom it compensates for\ncare provided to beneficiaries provide such care without\nracial discrimination; failure to provide an adequate\nstatement of the extent to which racial discrimination\nexisted in connection with federally aided welfare\nprograms; and failure to propose methods of administering\nwelfare programs in a way which gave reasonable assurance\nof nondiscriminatory operation ((cid:9) ).\nII. Judicial Proceedings.\nOn January 13, 1967, the Alabama Department\nbrought an action in the United States District Court\nfor the Northern District of Alabama challenging the\nvalidity of Secretary Gardner's order and the underlying\n\nregulation. The complaint was based on §10 of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §1009, and on\n28 U.S.C. §1331. The Secretary filed a motion to\ndismiss for lack of jurisdiction.  However, on Febru-\nary 3, 1967, the district court granted a preliminary\ninjunction against enforcement of the Secretary's order.\nSecretary Gardner filed a timely notice of appeal ((cid:9) ).\nOn February 18, 1967, the State of Alabama filed\nin the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth\nCircuit a petition for direct review of the Secretary's\norder. This action was based upon 42 U.S.C. §1316 and\n§603 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and pertained to four\nof the five welfare programs (i.e., all except child\nwelfare services, Title V, part 3). Alabama contended\nthat jurisdiction for review as to all of the programs\nwas properly in the district court, but, in the\nalternative, that if the court of appeals had sole juris-\ndiction over the four programs such review was sought.\nAlabama sought to amend its complaint by adding\nas plaintiffs four individuals alleged to be welfare\nrecipients. Over the objection of the United States,\nthe district court allowed the filing of this amendment\nto the complaint (R.(cid:9) ).\n\nThe court of appeals,on March 14, 1967, granted\nSecretary Gardner's motion to consolidate the appeal\nand the petition for review.\nOn August 29, 1967, the court of appeals rendered\na decision upholding the validity of the HEW regulation\nand the decision of the Secretary Gardner. The court\nheld that it had exclusive jurisdiction regarding\nreview as to each of the five programs.\nOn September 25, 1967, the court of appeals\nstayed its mandate for 30 days or until final disposition\nof the cases by the Supreme Court.\n[It might be appropriate at this point to discuss\nthe fact that negotiations are being conducted regarding\nan assurance which would be filed in the event certiorari\nis denied.]\n\nARGUMENT\nI. THE COURT OF APPEALS WAS CORRECT IN\nUPHOLDING THE VALIDITY OF THE HEW REGULATION\nAND THE ORDER TERMINATING FINANCIAL AID.\nThe basic issue presented is the validity of\nSecretary Gardner's order regarding termination of\npayments to Alabama. We submit that the court of\nappeals was correct in concluding that the Secretary's\norder and the regulation upon which it was based were\nvalid.\nSecretary Gardner found that the State of Alabama\nhad failed to satisfy the requirement, imposed by\n§80.4(b) of the HEW regulation, that it furnish an\nadequate assurance of compliance with the regulation.\nAs to the general validity of this requirement, the\ncourt of appeals stated the following (R.(cid:9) ).\n* * * We find this procedure of submitting\nan assurance form to be particularly appropri-\nate because it conforms to the basic structure\nof the welfare statute and the regulations\ninitially establishing the assistance programs.\nCertainly, adoption of the assurance technique was a\nreasonable exercise of the authority granted to the\n\nDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare by §602\nof the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Just as the Social\nSecurity Act requires the state to submit a suitable\nplan for operation of the welfare programs, so HEW\nis justified, under Title VI, in insisting that the\nstate furnish an assurance which identifies the\nareas where racial discrimination is practiced in\nits programs and in the facilities used in these\nprograms, which commits it to use its best efforts\nto eliminate that racial discrimination, and which\ndescribes how it proposes to go about that task.\nEach of the federal departments which adopted\nregulations implementing Title VI included a\nrequirement that an assurance be given as a condition\nfor the grant or continuation of federal aid. See,\ne.g., 32 C.F.R. §300.6 (Department of Defense);\n7 C.F.R. §15.4 (Department of Agriculture).\nDuring the congressional debate on Title VI,\nit was recognized that the assurance method would be\nan appropriate means of administration. See, e.g.,\n110 Cong. Rec. 7059 (April 7, 1964) (remarks of\nSenator Pastore).\n\nThe primary objection which Alabama has\nraised pertains to the requirement that the assurance\ncover not only state instrumentalities, but also\n\"third parties\" who provide services in connection\nwith the welfare programs. Section 80.3 of the\nregulation prohibits recipients (here, the state)\nfrom discriminating \"directly or through contractual\nOr other arrangements.\"\nIn January 1965, HEW sent to each state agency\nwhich administered an approved public assistance plan\na handbook which outlined the agency's responsibilities\nunder Title VI and included a sample assurance form,\nForm CB-FS-5022 (R.(cid:9) ). Contained in this sample\nform was the following: \"The state agency will take\nsuch steps as necessary to assure that any other\nagency, institution or organization participating in\nthe program, through contractual or other arrangements,\nwill comply with the Act and Regulation.\"\n(continued on following page)\n\nSection 80.5(a) states, by way of illustration, that\nthe prohibition against discrimination extends to\n\"services purchased. . . [by the state] from hospitals,\nnursing homes, schools, and similar institutions. .\nand to the facilities in which such services are provided. .\n•(cid:9) •\nAlabama has refused to submit an assurance that\nwould apply to doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, and\nother institutions which play a part in the welfare\nprograms. The basis for this refusal was the contention\nthat the state had no authority to control such institu-\ntions.\nThe court of appeals sustained the third-party\nprovisions, holding that their requirement was \"that\nAlabama assume the responsibility and make a good faith\neffort toward eliminating racial discrimination in its\nstate-wide federally assisted welfare program\" (R.(cid:9) )\n(continued frcm preceding page)\nAs noted by the court of appeals (R.(cid:9) ), the\nform included in the handbook is merely a sample; that\nis, HEW does not insist that it be followed exactly.\n\nClearly, there is no merit in the view that Alabama\ncan disclaim all responsibility for the actions of\nthe private individuals and agencies which participate\nin the welfare programs.\nIt is important to bear in mind the fact that\nAlabama is challenging the regulation itself, not\napplication of the third-party requirement to\nparticular situations. Thus, there is no occasion\nin this litigation to determine whether a particular\nphysician or a particular institution falls within\nthe scope of the HEW regulation.\nMoreover, the question here is not whether\nthe \"third parties\" can be regarded as agents of the\nstate for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. The\nissue is whether Title VI authorizes a regulation which\nprohibits ,ellot only discrimination by the state directly\n_/(cid:9) Even though the question here is one cf statutory\n(rather than constitutional) obligation, certain decisions\nconstruing the Fourteenth Amendment are relevant. The fol-\nlowing are among the decisions which indicate thatAstate's\nconstitutional duties can apply when state-related functions\n(continued on following page)\n\nbut also discrimination \"through contractual or other\narrangements.\" The purpose of Title VI would surely\nbe defeated if a state could avoid the requirement\nof nondiscrimination simply by delegating to private\n,,Z1fr\nagencies functions connected with the welfare programs.\nA relevant decision in this regard is Boynton v.\nVirginia, 364 U.S. 454, where the Court held that\n§216(d) of Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act,\n49 U.S.C. §316(d), which made it unlawful for a \"common\ncarrier by motor vehicle. . . to subject any particular\nperson. . . to any unjust discrimination. . .,\" was\n(continued from preceding page)\nare performed by private agencies: Burton v. Wilmington \nParking Authority, 365 U.S. 715; Evans v. Newton, 382\nU.S. 296; Derrington v. Plummer, 240 F.2d 922 (C.A. 5);\nSimkins v. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, 323 F.2d 959\n(C.A. 4), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 938. The same princple\nshould be applicable to the responsibilities which\nTitle VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act places upon the\nstates.\n\napplicable to a restaurant located in a bus terminal.\nThus, the carrier's statutory duty was extended to\na facility which furnished services to the passengers\nFollowing the decision in Boyton v. Virginia, the\nInterstate Commerce Commission, entered an order in a\nproceeding entitled Discrimination in Operation of\n.._atgratate Motor Carriers of Passengemal Dkt. No. MC-C335\n(Sept. 22, 1961), which provided in part as follows:\n180a(4) No motor common carrier of passen-\ngers subject to section 216 of the Inter-\nstate Commerce Act shall in the operation\nof vehicles in interstate or foreign com-\nmerce provide, maintain arrangements for,\nutilize, make available, adhere to any under-\nstanding for the availability of, or follow\nany practice which includes the availability\nof, any terminal facilities whicha-e so\noperated, arranged, or maintained as to\ninvolve any separation of any portion thereof,\nor in the use thereof on the basis of race,\ncolor, creed, or national origin.\nThe order was held to be valid in Georgia v.\nUnited States, 201 F. Supp. 813 (N.D. Ga.), aff'd\nper curiam, 371 U.S. 9.\n\nof the carrier. The reasoning in Boynton helps to\nindicate the validity of the prohibition, in the\nHEW regulation, against discrimination on the part\nof those who, as the result of \"contractual or other\narrangements\" with the state, provide services in\nconnection with the welfare programs.\nAlthough the following cases arose in contexts\nquite different from that of the present cases, they\nlend support to the general proposition that statutory\nobligations cannot be avoided by permitting \"third\nparties\" to perform the functions in question: Sinkler \nv. Missouri Pacific RR Co., 356 U.S. 326 (FELA); Carney\nv. Pittsburgh & Lake Erie RR Co., 316 F.2d 277 (C.A. 3),\ncert. denied, 375 U.S. 814 (FELA); Libbey-Owens Ford\nGlass Co., v. FTC, 352 F.2d 415 (C.A. 6).\nIt should be noted that part II of Executive Order\nNo. 11246, 30 Fed. Reg. 12319 (1965), which deals with\nnondiscrimination in employment, applies to both \"Govern-\nment contracts\" and the subcontracts and purchase orders\nof the contract holders. In Farmer v. Philadelphia \nElectric Co., 329 F.2d 3, 7 (C.A. 3), the court stated\nthe general view that Executive Order No. 10925, 26\nFed. Reg. 1977 (1961), which was the same in substance\nas Part II of No. 11246, had the force and effect of\nlaw. This dictum was followed by the Fifth Circuit in\nFarkas v. Texas Instrument, Inc., 375 F.2d 629.\n\nPetitioner makes a number of other assertions\nregarding the HEW regulation and the termination\norder, but we submit that none of these matters calls\nfor further review.\nThe state contends that one defect of Secretary\nGardner's termination order is that it applies to\nparts of the welfare programs involving payments which\ngo directly from the state to beneficiaries. In his\nJanuary 12, 1967 decision, Secretary Gardner pointed\nout that, although Alabama could have offered to comply\nregarding the parts of the programs which did not\ninvolve third-party services, the state had failed to\ndo so. (R.(cid:9) .) Moreover, Secretary Gardner\nspecifically invited the state to submit a satisfactory\ncompliance statement covering at least the direct-payment\nporition of the programs (R.(cid:9) ), and even urged Alabama\nto do so before the effective date of the termination\nS\norder (R. ). The state's failure to come forward\nwith a satisfactory assurance meant, of necessity, that\nthe Secretary's order continued to encompass both the\ndirect and the third-party aspects of the welfare programs.\n\nThe court of appeals was correct in concluding\nthat there was no merit in Alabama's contention that\nthe HEW regulation was inconsistent with the objectives\n/\nof the Social Security Act. Title VI of the 1964 Civil\nRights Act imposes the requirement of nondiscrimination\nin federally aided programs. As the court of appeals\ndetermined, the regulation in question represented a\nproper means of implementing Title VI. The court found,\nin particular, that the assurance requirement was con-\nsistent with the framework of the Social Security Act.\nThroughout the course of their dealings with the\nAlabama Department, HEW personnel sought to achieve\nvoluntary compliance. Alabama's continuing refusal to\nsubmit an acceptable assurance made necessary use, as\na last resort, of the sanction of aid termination. As\nthe court of appeals determined, Secretary Gardner's order\nand the regulation upon which it was based were in accord\nwith the provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n/(cid:9) Section 602 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.\n§2000d-1, states that agency regulation issued under Title VI\nmust be \"consistent with achievement of the objectives of the\nstatute authorizing the financial assistance in connection\nwith which the action is taken.\"\nSection 80.8(b) of the HEW regulation provides that in\nthe event of failure or refusal to furnish a required\nassurance, financial assistance can be refused.\n\nII. THE COURT OF APPEALS WAS CORRECT IN BASING ITS\nJURISDICTION UPON THE PETITION FOR DIRECT REVIEW.\nWe believe that the court of appeals acted\nproperly in basing its jurisdiction upon the petition\nfor direct review, rather than on the appeal from the\ndecision of the district court. Section 603 of the\n1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. §2000d-2) provides, in\npart, that: \"Any department or agency action taken\npursuant to section 602 shall be subject to such judicial\nreview as may otherwise be provided by law for similar\naction taken by such department or agency on other\ngrounds.\" As to four of the welfare programs involved\nin this litigation, a provision of the Social Security\nAct, 42 U.S.C. §1316, grants to the courts of appeals\njurisdiction to review administrative orders terminating,\non the ground of noncompliance with the state plan, the\npayment of federal funds. Thus, in view of the latter\nprovision and §603, the court of appeals was the correct\nforum for review of Secretary Gardner's order as it\naffected the four programs expressly covered by 42 U.S.C.f/2/6,\nc\nus-e-e 4e-t/ /efej\n\nl\nioreover, the court of appeals concluded that §603, in\nconjunction with 42 U.S.C. §1316, gave it jurisdiction with\nrespect to the fifth program, Title V, part 3.\nConsidering the circumstances of this case, the\ncourt's conclusion was proper. As the court of appeals\nnoted, there is a close relationship between the child\nwelfare services (Title V, part 3) and the program,\nunder Title IV of the Social Security Act, for aid to\n**/\n—\ndependent children.  A single order dealt with the five\nwelfare programs, and the substantive legal issues raised\nby the state's request for review were the same for all\nthe programs. The reasoning of the court of appeals is\nconsonant with the provisions of §603 and with the\nprinciples of sound judicial administration.\n*/The four programs which are the express coverage\nwta-i-t-t-eta \nunder\nof 42 U.S.C. §1316 are those established aftd Titles I, IV:\nX, and XIV of the Social Security Act.\n'**/The Social Security Act expressly requires, in\n42 U.S.C. § 723(a)(1)(A), that state plans for child welfare\nPr\"-'ide(cid:9) 7',,,,ee.o? 149 Ser,A\nservicesAprovided under such plan and the services provided\nfor dependent children under. . .[Title IV]....\" As noted\nabove, the judicial review provisions of 42 U.S.C. § 1316\nexpressly cover Title IV programs.\n\nThe court of appeals was correct in stating\nthat this Court's decisions in Abbott Laboratories,\n387 U.S. 136, and Gardner v. Tiolet Goods Ass'n_, 387\nU.S. 167, are inapplicable to the present cases. The\nformer cases involved the construction of statutory\npatterns which differed materially from that of\nTitle VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Also, in those\ncases, the respective plaintiffs were not seeking\njudicial review of administrative action specifically\ndirected at them, but sought to challenge certain regu-\nlations issued under the Federal Food, Drug, and\nCosmetic Act before enforcement of those regulations.\nFinally, there is no merit in the state's\ncontention that the court of appeals erred in declining\nto determine ktut the standing of the four individuals\nwhom the state sought to join as plaintiffs in the\ndistrict court action.2\n/ Regarding the status of the four individuals, the\ncourt of appeals relied on its decision that the district\ncourt was without jurisdiction. It should be noted that,\nwhile the district court granted leave to the state to\nfile its amendment providing for the addition of the\nindividual plaintiffs, the district court did not decide\nthe questions of standing and joinder. See R.\nThis was acknowledged by Alabama in its supplemental\nmemorandum in the court of appeals (p. 16 of the supple-\nmental memorandum).\n\nWe submit, for the reasons outlined above, that\nthe court of appeals resolved the jurisdictional matter\nproperly. However, even if it is assumed, for the sake\nof argument, that Alabama's theory regarding jurisliction\nis correct, the actual outcome of the litigation is not\naffected. The decision of the district court to issue a\npreliminary injunction was before the court of appeals by\nvirtue of Secretary Gardner's appeal. Therefore, without\nregard to the state's petition for direct review, the\nappeal from the district court provided a basis for\ndetermination by the court of appeals of the validity\nof the HEW regulation and the termination order.-X\nUnder these circumstances, there is clearly\nno need for this court to review the question of the\njurisdictional basis for the decision of the court of appeals.\n2 \nOne issue presented on review of the preliminary in-\njunction was whether there was a significant likelihood that\nthe state would prevail on the merits. See, e.g., Wooten v.\nOhier, 303 F.2d 759, 762 (C.A. 5).\n\nCONCLUSION\nNone of the questions raised by the petition\nrequires review by this Court. Accordingly, the\nwrit of certiorari should be denied.\n\nAPPENDIX\nSTATUTES AND REGULATIONS INVOLVED\n1.

Under section 80.3 of the regu-\nlation, recipients of federal financial aid are prohibited\nfrom engaging \"directly or through contractual or other\narrangements\" in certain specific discriminatory actions\nand in the use of methods of administration which have\nthe effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination\nbecause of their race, color, or national origin. Sec-\ntion 80.4(b) requires that every application by a state\nagency to carry out a program involving continuing federal\nfinancial assistance covered by the regulation contain:\n.(cid:9) . a statement that the program is(cid:9) . .\nconducted in compliance with all requirements\nimposed by. . . [the regulation], or a state-\nment of the extent to which it is not, at the\ntime the statement is made, so conducted, and\n(2) provide or be accompanied by provision\nfor such methods of administration for the\nprogram as are found by the responsible\nDepartment official to give reasonable\nassurance that the applicant and all recipients\nof Federal financial assistance under such\n\ncould not be obtained by voluntary means. Pursuant\nto §602 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Dr. Winston\noffered the Alabama Department an opportunity for a\nhearing with respect to the question of its compliance\nwith the regulation ((cid:9) ).\nOn August 20, 1965, Ruben K. King, Commissioner\nof the Alabama Department, sent to Dr. Winston a letter\nwhich he described as a \"statement of . . . compliance\nwith Title VI. . . .\" Commissioner King's letter stated\nthat the Alabama Department was in full conformity with\nthe 1964 Act regarding determination of eligibility for\naid and the amount of aid. His letter indicated that in\nsome local offices segregated facilities existed and\nthat various institutions, organizations, and contractors\nfrom which the Alabama Department obtained services\nfollowed a policy of segregation. However, Commissioner\nKing expressed the basic view that his Department had no\nauthority to control the practices of physicians or of\nthe hospitals, nursing homes, and other institutions\n\nOn August 27, 1965, HEW replied to Commissioner\nKing's letter and informed him that the statement of\ncompliance which he had submitted was not adequate\n). It was pointed out, for example, that the\na\nstatement did not indicate methods which woula be used\nby the Alabama Department to correct existing discrimi-\nnation.\nAn evidentiary hearing to determine Alabama's\ncompliance with the regulation was held on October 21,\n1965, before Hearing Examiner Robert L. Irwin ((cid:9) ).\nCommissioner King testified on behalf of the Alabama\nDepartment ((cid:9) On April 5, 1966, the hearing examiner\nissued a decision recommending that the Commissioner of\nWelfare terminate federal financial assistance1 under\nTitles I, IV? V (part 3), X andXIV of the Social Security\nAct1to the State of Alabama ((cid:9) ). This decision,\nsubject to certain modifications, was adopted by\nCommissioner Winston on November 16, 1966 ((cid:9) ). On\nJanuary 12, 1967, Secretary John W. Gardner approved\nthe Commissioner's decision and ordered the termination\n\nof aid to the State of Alabama. 1 Secretary Gardner\nfound noncompliance on the part of the Alabama\nDepartment in the following respects: failure to\nmake an adequate commitment to assure nondiscriminatory\noperation of its federally aided welfare programs even\nin those parts which involved direct payments from the\nAlabama Department to beneficiaries; refusal to accept\nany responsibility for assuring that third parties to\nwhom it provides services or whom it compensates for\ncare provided to beneficiaries provide such care without\nracial discrimination; failure to provide an adequate\nstatement of the extent to which racial discrimination\nexisted in connection with federally aided welfare\nprograms; and failure to propose methods of administering\nwelfare programs in a way which gave reasonable assurance\nof nondiscriminatory operation ((cid:9) ).\nII. Judicial Proceedings.\nOn January 13, 1967, the Alabama Department\nbrought an action in the United States District Court\nfor the Northern District of Alabama challenging the\nvalidity of Secretary Gardner's order and the underlying\n\nregulation. The complaint was based on §10 of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §1009, and on\n28 U.S.C. §1331. The Secretary filed a motion to\ndismiss for lack of jurisdiction.  However, on Febru-\nary 3, 1967, the district court granted a preliminary\ninjunction against enforcement of the Secretary's order.\nSecretary Gardner filed a timely notice of appeal ((cid:9) ).\nOn February 18, 1967, the State of Alabama filed\nin the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth\nCircuit a petition for direct review of the Secretary's\norder. This action was based upon 42 U.S.C. §1316 and\n§603 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and pertained to four\nof the five welfare programs (i.e., all except child\nwelfare services, Title V, part 3). Alabama contended\nthat jurisdiction for review as to all of the programs\nwas properly in the district court, but, in the\nalternative, that if the court of appeals had sole juris-\ndiction over the four programs such review was sought.\nAlabama sought to amend its complaint by adding\nas plaintiffs four individuals alleged to be welfare\nrecipients. Over the objection of the United States,\nthe district court allowed the filing of this amendment\nto the complaint (R.(cid:9) ).\n\nThe court of appeals,on March 14, 1967, granted\nSecretary Gardner's motion to consolidate the appeal\nand the petition for review.\nOn August 29, 1967, the court of appeals rendered\na decision upholding the validity of the HEW regulation\nand the decision of the Secretary Gardner. The court\nheld that it had exclusive jurisdiction regarding\nreview as to each of the five programs.\nOn September 25, 1967, the court of appeals\nstayed its mandate for 30 days or until final disposition\nof the cases by the Supreme Court.\n[It might be appropriate at this point to discuss\nthe fact that negotiations are being conducted regarding\nan assurance which would be filed in the event certiorari\nis denied.]\n\nARGUMENT\nI. THE COURT OF APPEALS WAS CORRECT IN\nUPHOLDING THE VALIDITY OF THE HEW REGULATION\nAND THE ORDER TERMINATING FINANCIAL AID.\nThe basic issue presented is the validity of\nSecretary Gardner's order regarding termination of\npayments to Alabama. We submit that the court of\nappeals was correct in concluding that the Secretary's\norder and the regulation upon which it was based were\nvalid.\nSecretary Gardner found that the State of Alabama\nhad failed to satisfy the requirement, imposed by\n§80.4(b) of the HEW regulation, that it furnish an\nadequate assurance of compliance with the regulation.\nAs to the general validity of this requirement, the\ncourt of appeals stated the following (R.(cid:9) ).\n* * * We find this procedure of submitting\nan assurance form to be particularly appropri-\nate because it conforms to the basic structure\nof the welfare statute and the regulations\ninitially establishing the assistance programs.\nCertainly, adoption of the assurance technique was a\nreasonable exercise of the authority granted to the\n\nDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare by §602\nof the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Just as the Social\nSecurity Act requires the state to submit a suitable\nplan for operation of the welfare programs, so HEW\nis justified, under Title VI, in insisting that the\nstate furnish an assurance which identifies the\nareas where racial discrimination is practiced in\nits programs and in the facilities used in these\nprograms, which commits it to use its best efforts\nto eliminate that racial discrimination, and which\ndescribes how it proposes to go about that task.\nEach of the federal departments which adopted\nregulations implementing Title VI included a\nrequirement that an assurance be given as a condition\nfor the grant or continuation of federal aid. See,\ne.g., 32 C.F.R. §300.6 (Department of Defense);\n7 C.F.R. §15.4 (Department of Agriculture).\nDuring the congressional debate on Title VI,\nit was recognized that the assurance method would be\nan appropriate means of administration. See, e.g.,\n110 Cong. Rec. 7059 (April 7, 1964) (remarks of\nSenator Pastore).\n\nThe primary objection which Alabama has\nraised pertains to the requirement that the assurance\ncover not only state instrumentalities, but also\n\"third parties\" who provide services in connection\nwith the welfare programs. Section 80.3 of the\nregulation prohibits recipients (here, the state)\nfrom discriminating \"directly or through contractual\nOr other arrangements.\"\nIn January 1965, HEW sent to each state agency\nwhich administered an approved public assistance plan\na handbook which outlined the agency's responsibilities\nunder Title VI and included a sample assurance form,\nForm CB-FS-5022 (R.(cid:9) ). Contained in this sample\nform was the following: \"The state agency will take\nsuch steps as necessary to assure that any other\nagency, institution or organization participating in\nthe program, through contractual or other arrangements,\nwill comply with the Act and Regulation.\"\n(continued on following page)\n\nSection 80.5(a) states, by way of illustration, that\nthe prohibition against discrimination extends to\n\"services purchased. . . [by the state] from hospitals,\nnursing homes, schools, and similar institutions. .\nand to the facilities in which such services are provided. .\n•(cid:9) •\nAlabama has refused to submit an assurance that\nwould apply to doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, and\nother institutions which play a part in the welfare\nprograms. The basis for this refusal was the contention\nthat the state had no authority to control such institu-\ntions.\nThe court of appeals sustained the third-party\nprovisions, holding that their requirement was \"that\nAlabama assume the responsibility and make a good faith\neffort toward eliminating racial discrimination in its\nstate-wide federally assisted welfare program\" (R.(cid:9) )\n(continued frcm preceding page)\nAs noted by the court of appeals (R.(cid:9) ), the\nform included in the handbook is merely a sample; that\nis, HEW does not insist that it be followed exactly.\n\nClearly, there is no merit in the view that Alabama\ncan disclaim all responsibility for the actions of\nthe private individuals and agencies which participate\nin the welfare programs.\nIt is important to bear in mind the fact that\nAlabama is challenging the regulation itself, not\napplication of the third-party requirement to\nparticular situations. Thus, there is no occasion\nin this litigation to determine whether a particular\nphysician or a particular institution falls within\nthe scope of the HEW regulation.\nMoreover, the question here is not whether\nthe \"third parties\" can be regarded as agents of the\nstate for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. The\nissue is whether Title VI authorizes a regulation which\nprohibits ,ellot only discrimination by the state directly\n_/(cid:9) Even though the question here is one cf statutory\n(rather than constitutional) obligation, certain decisions\nconstruing the Fourteenth Amendment are relevant. The fol-\nlowing are among the decisions which indicate thatAstate's\nconstitutional duties can apply when state-related functions\n(continued on following page)\n\nbut also discrimination \"through contractual or other\narrangements.\" The purpose of Title VI would surely\nbe defeated if a state could avoid the requirement\nof nondiscrimination simply by delegating to private\n,,Z1fr\nagencies functions connected with the welfare programs.\nA relevant decision in this regard is Boynton v.\nVirginia, 364 U.S. 454, where the Court held that\n§216(d) of Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act,\n49 U.S.C. §316(d), which made it unlawful for a \"common\ncarrier by motor vehicle. . . to subject any particular\nperson. . . to any unjust discrimination. . .,\" was\n(continued from preceding page)\nare performed by private agencies: Burton v. Wilmington \nParking Authority, 365 U.S. 715; Evans v. Newton, 382\nU.S. 296; Derrington v. Plummer, 240 F.2d 922 (C.A. 5);\nSimkins v. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, 323 F.2d 959\n(C.A. 4), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 938. The same princple\nshould be applicable to the responsibilities which\nTitle VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act places upon the\nstates.\n\napplicable to a restaurant located in a bus terminal.\nThus, the carrier's statutory duty was extended to\na facility which furnished services to the passengers\nFollowing the decision in Boyton v. Virginia, the\nInterstate Commerce Commission, entered an order in a\nproceeding entitled Discrimination in Operation of\n.._atgratate Motor Carriers of Passengemal Dkt. No. MC-C335\n(Sept. 22, 1961), which provided in part as follows:\n180a(4) No motor common carrier of passen-\ngers subject to section 216 of the Inter-\nstate Commerce Act shall in the operation\nof vehicles in interstate or foreign com-\nmerce provide, maintain arrangements for,\nutilize, make available, adhere to any under-\nstanding for the availability of, or follow\nany practice which includes the availability\nof, any terminal facilities whicha-e so\noperated, arranged, or maintained as to\ninvolve any separation of any portion thereof,\nor in the use thereof on the basis of race,\ncolor, creed, or national origin.\nThe order was held to be valid in Georgia v.\nUnited States, 201 F. Supp. 813 (N.D. Ga.), aff'd\nper curiam, 371 U.S. 9.\n\nof the carrier. The reasoning in Boynton helps to\nindicate the validity of the prohibition, in the\nHEW regulation, against discrimination on the part\nof those who, as the result of \"contractual or other\narrangements\" with the state, provide services in\nconnection with the welfare programs.\nAlthough the following cases arose in contexts\nquite different from that of the present cases, they\nlend support to the general proposition that statutory\nobligations cannot be avoided by permitting \"third\nparties\" to perform the functions in question: Sinkler \nv. Missouri Pacific RR Co., 356 U.S. 326 (FELA); Carney\nv. Pittsburgh & Lake Erie RR Co., 316 F.2d 277 (C.A. 3),\ncert. denied, 375 U.S. 814 (FELA); Libbey-Owens Ford\nGlass Co., v. FTC, 352 F.2d 415 (C.A. 6).\nIt should be noted that part II of Executive Order\nNo. 11246, 30 Fed. Reg. 12319 (1965), which deals with\nnondiscrimination in employment, applies to both \"Govern-\nment contracts\" and the subcontracts and purchase orders\nof the contract holders. In Farmer v. Philadelphia \nElectric Co., 329 F.2d 3, 7 (C.A. 3), the court stated\nthe general view that Executive Order No. 10925, 26\nFed. Reg. 1977 (1961), which was the same in substance\nas Part II of No. 11246, had the force and effect of\nlaw. This dictum was followed by the Fifth Circuit in\nFarkas v. Texas Instrument, Inc., 375 F.2d 629.\n\nPetitioner makes a number of other assertions\nregarding the HEW regulation and the termination\norder, but we submit that none of these matters calls\nfor further review.\nThe state contends that one defect of Secretary\nGardner's termination order is that it applies to\nparts of the welfare programs involving payments which\ngo directly from the state to beneficiaries. In his\nJanuary 12, 1967 decision, Secretary Gardner pointed\nout that, although Alabama could have offered to comply\nregarding the parts of the programs which did not\ninvolve third-party services, the state had failed to\ndo so. (R.(cid:9) .) Moreover, Secretary Gardner\nspecifically invited the state to submit a satisfactory\ncompliance statement covering at least the direct-payment\nporition of the programs (R.(cid:9) ), and even urged Alabama\nto do so before the effective date of the termination\nS\norder (R. ). The state's failure to come forward\nwith a satisfactory assurance meant, of necessity, that\nthe Secretary's order continued to encompass both the\ndirect and the third-party aspects of the welfare programs.\n\nThe court of appeals was correct in concluding\nthat there was no merit in Alabama's contention that\nthe HEW regulation was inconsistent with the objectives\n/\nof the Social Security Act. Title VI of the 1964 Civil\nRights Act imposes the requirement of nondiscrimination\nin federally aided programs. As the court of appeals\ndetermined, the regulation in question represented a\nproper means of implementing Title VI. The court found,\nin particular, that the assurance requirement was con-\nsistent with the framework of the Social Security Act.\nThroughout the course of their dealings with the\nAlabama Department, HEW personnel sought to achieve\nvoluntary compliance. Alabama's continuing refusal to\nsubmit an acceptable assurance made necessary use, as\na last resort, of the sanction of aid termination. As\nthe court of appeals determined, Secretary Gardner's order\nand the regulation upon which it was based were in accord\nwith the provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n/(cid:9) Section 602 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.\n§2000d-1, states that agency regulation issued under Title VI\nmust be \"consistent with achievement of the objectives of the\nstatute authorizing the financial assistance in connection\nwith which the action is taken.\"\nSection 80.8(b) of the HEW regulation provides that in\nthe event of failure or refusal to furnish a required\nassurance, financial assistance can be refused.\n\nII. THE COURT OF APPEALS WAS CORRECT IN BASING ITS\nJURISDICTION UPON THE PETITION FOR DIRECT REVIEW.\nWe believe that the court of appeals acted\nproperly in basing its jurisdiction upon the petition\nfor direct review, rather than on the appeal from the\ndecision of the district court. Section 603 of the\n1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. §2000d-2) provides, in\npart, that: \"Any department or agency action taken\npursuant to section 602 shall be subject to such judicial\nreview as may otherwise be provided by law for similar\naction taken by such department or agency on other\ngrounds.\" As to four of the welfare programs involved\nin this litigation, a provision of the Social Security\nAct, 42 U.S.C. §1316, grants to the courts of appeals\njurisdiction to review administrative orders terminating,\non the ground of noncompliance with the state plan, the\npayment of federal funds. Thus, in view of the latter\nprovision and §603, the court of appeals was the correct\nforum for review of Secretary Gardner's order as it\naffected the four programs expressly covered by 42 U.S.C.f/2/6,\nc\nus-e-e 4e-t/ /efej\n\nl\nioreover, the court of appeals concluded that §603, in\nconjunction with 42 U.S.C. §1316, gave it jurisdiction with\nrespect to the fifth program, Title V, part 3.\nConsidering the circumstances of this case, the\ncourt's conclusion was proper. As the court of appeals\nnoted, there is a close relationship between the child\nwelfare services (Title V, part 3) and the program,\nunder Title IV of the Social Security Act, for aid to\n**/\n—\ndependent children.  A single order dealt with the five\nwelfare programs, and the substantive legal issues raised\nby the state's request for review were the same for all\nthe programs. The reasoning of the court of appeals is\nconsonant with the provisions of §603 and with the\nprinciples of sound judicial administration.\n*/The four programs which are the express coverage\nwta-i-t-t-eta \nunder\nof 42 U.S.C. §1316 are those established aftd Titles I, IV:\nX, and XIV of the Social Security Act.\n'**/The Social Security Act expressly requires, in\n42 U.S.C. § 723(a)(1)(A), that state plans for child welfare\nPr\"-'ide(cid:9) 7',,,,ee.o? 149 Ser,A\nservicesAprovided under such plan and the services provided\nfor dependent children under. . .[Title IV]....\" As noted\nabove, the judicial review provisions of 42 U.S.C. § 1316\nexpressly cover Title IV programs.\n\nThe court of appeals was correct in stating\nthat this Court's decisions in Abbott Laboratories,\n387 U.S. 136, and Gardner v. Tiolet Goods Ass'n_, 387\nU.S. 167, are inapplicable to the present cases. The\nformer cases involved the construction of statutory\npatterns which differed materially from that of\nTitle VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Also, in those\ncases, the respective plaintiffs were not seeking\njudicial review of administrative action specifically\ndirected at them, but sought to challenge certain regu-\nlations issued under the Federal Food, Drug, and\nCosmetic Act before enforcement of those regulations.\nFinally, there is no merit in the state's\ncontention that the court of appeals erred in declining\nto determine ktut the standing of the four individuals\nwhom the state sought to join as plaintiffs in the\ndistrict court action.2\n/ Regarding the status of the four individuals, the\ncourt of appeals relied on its decision that the district\ncourt was without jurisdiction. It should be noted that,\nwhile the district court granted leave to the state to\nfile its amendment providing for the addition of the\nindividual plaintiffs, the district court did not decide\nthe questions of standing and joinder. See R.\nThis was acknowledged by Alabama in its supplemental\nmemorandum in the court of appeals (p. 16 of the supple-\nmental memorandum).\n\nWe submit, for the reasons outlined above, that\nthe court of appeals resolved the jurisdictional matter\nproperly. However, even if it is assumed, for the sake\nof argument, that Alabama's theory regarding jurisliction\nis correct, the actual outcome of the litigation is not\naffected. The decision of the district court to issue a\npreliminary injunction was before the court of appeals by\nvirtue of Secretary Gardner's appeal. Therefore, without\nregard to the state's petition for direct review, the\nappeal from the district court provided a basis for\ndetermination by the court of appeals of the validity\nof the HEW regulation and the termination order.-X\nUnder these circumstances, there is clearly\nno need for this court to review the question of the\njurisdictional basis for the decision of the court of appeals.\n2 \nOne issue presented on review of the preliminary in-\njunction was whether there was a significant likelihood that\nthe state would prevail on the merits. See, e.g., Wooten v.\nOhier, 303 F.2d 759, 762 (C.A. 5).\n\nCONCLUSION\nNone of the questions raised by the petition\nrequires review by this Court. Accordingly, the\nwrit of certiorari should be denied.\n\nAPPENDIX\nSTATUTES AND REGULATIONS INVOLVED\n1.

Jurisdiction \nThere are five titles in the Social Security Act under which the\nState of Alabama receives almost one million dollars per year in\nwelfare assistance. These are Titles I (Old Age Assistance), IV\n(Aid to Families with Dependent Children), V (part 3) (Child Welfare\nr \nServices), X (Aid  the Blind) and XIV (Aid to the Permanently and\nTotally Disabled).\nSection 603 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides\nfor judicial review of administrative action terminating assistance\n\"as may otherwise be provided by law for similar action taken by\nsuch department or agency opt other grounds.\" In the event judicial\nreview is not otherwise provided lander-Stect4en-603, review is in\naccordance with Section 10 of the 'AdministrativeProcedures Act\nwhich provide for review in a coure of competent jurisdiction.\n5 U.

Case law is clear that jurisdiction\nin the court provided by statute, is exclusive. See e.g., Fletcher \nv. Atomic Energy Commission, 192 F. Zd 29 (C. A. D. C.(cid:9)\nAct te.)\nThe remaining program (Title V (part 3), involves child welfare\nservices and represents only one million of the one hundred million\ndollars which goes to the State annually. There is no specific pro-\nvision in the Social Security Act for judicial review of administrative\naction under this Title, but there is a good argument that revip•-\nshould be in the Court of Appeals in this case.\n\nprogram.

The clear intention\nof the Court was to assert jurisdiction for the whole case and\nto enter an appealable order. At the close of the hearing he ex-\npressed publicly from the bench, when he announced that a\npreliminary injunction would be granted, that the matter will\nultimately have to be resolved by the Court of Appeals and that\nthat Court would consider ti as an emergency matter. The\nJudge added that if it goes to that Court \"I [am] hopeful that\nthey could consider the entire matter at that time and I feel\nlike they would.\" W. have also had indications that the\nplaintiff, if we appeal, is considering filing an alternative\npetition for review of the administrative decision in the Court\nof Appeals in the event of an unfavoable ruling do the appeal\non the jurisdiction issues. This appeal would be justified 00011\nU there were no prospect of winning on the jurisdictional\nquestion an it relates to Title V. We feel confident of winning\non the jurisdictional issue as it related to the other four programs\nand once the Court of Appeals assumed jurisdiction over the\nSecretary', order a. it related to those four programs, the\nDistrict Court would take no further action on Title V until\nthe Court of Appeals determined the validity of the Health,\nEducation and Welfare regulations.\nTechnically, in order to succeed, the United States must\nshow an abuse of discretion in the District Court. If we are\nright on the jurisdictional issue or at least on the four titles\nch should clearly be in that Court, the assertion of juris-\ndiction and the granting of preliminary injunction one month\nbefore the effective date of the termination order, and prior\nto ruling on the motion to dismiss, would in my view be an\nabuse of discretion.\n\nOn the merits, I think we have a good argument that the\nfailure to substantially comply with the assurance requirements\nof the regulations warrant, under Title VI, termination of\nassistance.\nThe objective of the Government is to get compliance by the\nState, The State's Attorney has indicated that the State would\nt \nsign the appropriate assurance if their position  found to be\nin error in the courts. In my view, there is little likelihood of\nany reasonably expeditious resolution of the case in the District\nCourt, even on the jurisdactional issue. The Judge has\nindicated as much. Under these circumstances, an appeal,\nwin or loss, will not kikely delay the case. I believe the United\nStates has a responsibility in this case to take every possible\nlegal step to expedite judicial review of Secretary Gardner's\ndecision.\nConclusion \nI recommend that we immediately appeal the District Court's\norder and ask the Court of Appeals for an expedited hearing.\n\nThurgood Marshall\nSolicitor General\nJD:DRO:ash\nJohn Dear\nAssistant Attorney General\nCivil Rights Division\nRecommended Appeal in St aotfe Alabama on Behalf of the\nDepartment of Pensions and Security v.

      "text": "COMMENTS UPON THE EFFECT OF THE RECENT\nSUPREME COURT DECISIONS UPON THE\nJURISDICTIONAL QUESTIONS HERE INVOLVED\n1. The opinions referred to, issued May 22,\n1967, and reported in the United States Law Week, May 23,\n1967, respectively, at pp. 4431, 4433, 4439, and 4441 (the\nlatter constituting a concurring opinion in No. 336 and a\ndissenting opinion in Nos. 39 and 438), are as follows:\nThe Toilet Goods Association v. Gardner (No. 336),\nAbbott Laboratories v. Gardner (No. 39),\nGardner v. The Toilet Goods Association (No. 438),\nand The Toilet Goods Association v. Gardner \n(showing the concurring and dissenting opinions\nin the three cases above mentioned).\nWe do not think that we can be very helpful to\nthe Court by any extended discussions or analyses of these\ncases. The only possible aid that we can provide, if we\ncan provide any at all, would be by discussion and analy-\nsis in as brief and succinct a form as possible.\nAll involved regulations promulgated by the\nCommissioner of Food and Drugs in the Department of\nHealth, Education and Welfare. Under the first of these\n(No. 39), p. 4431, the Court, through Justice Harlan, held\nthat under the circumstances of that particular case a\n\ndeclaratory judgment suit was premature, the controversy\nnot having ripened, and that on account of that fact, a\ndetermination after a suspension of certificates by the\nCommissioner could promptly be challenged through an\nadministrative procedure provided in the Act, with judi-\ncial review; that such review would provide an adequate\nforum for \"testing the regulation in a concrete situation.\"\nThe Court found that under the circumstances it was neces-\nsary to decide whether eventually a judicial review, if\nthe point were ever reached, would properly be invoked in\nthe District Court or any Court of Appeals, under the\nprovisions of the particular Act.\nIn the second listed case (No. 39), p. 4433,\nthe Court held that, since the enactment by the Commis-\nsioner or the Department of the regulation complained of,\nif exceeding the authority of the Act itself, constituted\nsuch an immediate threat to the complaining company as\nthat it might cause an irreparable injury for the company\nto await an administrative hearing, a declaratory judg-\nment suit in the District Court would lie, despite the\nfact that there was provided in the Act a right of appeal\n2\n\nto a Court of Appeals from the decision of the admini-\nstrative agency. The Court also held that under the\ncircumstances of the case the complaining industry was\nnot required to take steps which might constitute a vio-\nlation of the law and regulations if held valid and await\nanother judicial review consisting of proceedings by the\nGovernment to compel enforcement. The holding was that,\nas we understand it, the validity of certain regulations\nin such case involved a legal question to be decided,\nnot encompassed by the decision before the administrative\nagency (only on a factual issue) or the Court of Appeals\nwhich could review only the decision of the administrative\nagency, and since the regulations complained of were not\nencompassed under the statutory procedure for the admini-\nstrative hearing with special review, the complaining\nindustry had a right to invoke declaratory judgment or\ninjunction procedures under the Administrative Procedure\nAct, Title 5, §703, et seq. (formerly §1009).\nIn the third case (No. 438), p. 4439, the\nholding was essentially the same, although involving\ndifferent regulations and requirements. In both of the\n3\n\ntwo said decisions, it was held that the circumstances\nwere such that the complainant was not required to exhaust\nits administrative remedies, such being inadequate and not\nactually involving the legal validity of the regulation,\nand might invoke a 'pre-enforcement review\" of the regu-\nlation, in a District Court by declaratory judgment or\ninjunction suit, under the so-called \"catch-all\" clause\nof the Administrative Procedure Act, despite the fact\nthat the Food and Drug Act specifically mentioned only\none judicial review in cases for certain regulations (the\nCourt of Appeals) and a proceeding by the Government to\ncompel enforcement. Admittedly, as we understand it, in\nenforcement proceedings by the Government after alleged\nviolation of the Act and regulations, the complainant\nwould be entitled to set up any defense. However, the\npenalty might be so great, and irreparable injury so\nimminent, that the complainant had the right to go into\na District Court of its own choosing, having proper venue,\nto test the validity of the regulation.\nUnder the circumstances of the cases involved\nin the second and third listed opinions, the fact that\n4\n\nCongress prescribed a certain court, or courts, in which\nreview could be had, would not preclude a review under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act by declaratory judgment or\ninjunction in the District Court, in the absence of a\nprovision in the Act expressly excluding such a remedy.\nThe fourth opinion, setting forth the dissenting\nor concurring opinions of Justices Fortas and Clark, sheds\nlight upon the effect of the holding of the majority, and\nupon the rejection by the majority opinion of the con-\ntentions made by the Government.\nOur further conclusion is that, under the\nrationale of these decisions, if the issue is one required\nby the particular Act to be decided by an administrative\nagency, then the administrative remedies must be exhaust-\ning, including the prescribed method of judicial review,\nwhatever this may be, but that otherwise the remedy need\n1\nnot be exhausted  and the complaining party may proceed\n1\nThis premise is effectively demonstrated in Skinner &\nEddy Corp. v. United States, 249 U.S. 557 (Hdn. 1), 563,\nin the following language:\n\"First. The defendants contend that the district\ncourt did not have jurisdiction of the subject\n5\n\nin the District Court under the catch-all clause of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act to review a final action of\nthe administrative agency the final action in such case,\nas stated in the Supreme Court decisions, being the putting\ninto effect of a rule or regulation asserted by the com-\nplainant to be in excess of the agency's statutory power\nand thus invalid.\n(coned)\nmatter of this suit; because orders entered in a\n4th section proceeding cannot be assailed in the\ncourts; at least, not until after a remedy has\nbeen sought under §§ 13 and 15 of the Act to\nRegulate Commerce. This contention proceeds\napparently upon a misapprehension of plaintiff's\nposition. If plaintiff had sought relief against\na rate or practice alleged to be unjust because\nunreasonably high or discriminatory, the remedy\nmust have been sought primarily by proceedings\nbefore the Commission;\" [citing cases] \"and\nthe finding thereon would have been conclusive,\nunless there was lack of substantial evidence,\nsome irregularity in the proceedings, or some\nerror in the application of rules of law.\" [citing\ncases] \"But plaintiff does not contend that 75\ncents is an unreasonably high rate, or that it is\ndiscriminatory, or that there was mere error in\nthe action of the Commission. The contention is\nthat the Commission has exceeded its statutory\npowers; and that, hence, the order is void. In\nsuch a case the courts have jurisdiction of suits\nto enjoin the enforcement of an order, even if\nthe plaintiff has not attempted to secure redress\nin a proceeding before the Commission.\"\n6\nwe,\n\ncertainly did not think that the validity of the regulations\nor requirements was a matter to be decided either on the\nadministrative hearing or by him, as evidenced by the\nfollowing provision of his \"Approval of Decision\", Vol. II,\n2\nAppendix to the Secretary's brief, paragraph 1, as follows:\n\"The Alabama agency recognizes that the\n'legality' of this Department's Title\nVI Regulation is not a question to be\nconsidered in this proceeding. This\nissue may be raised before the court.\"\nIf the Secretary is correct in stating that he\nhad no authority to strike down his regulation or require-\nment, then the administrative proceeding was palpably  in-\nadequate for deciding the issue, and such inadequacy, in\nour opinion, would be transferred to any specific statu-\ntory provision for a review of the Secretary's de-\ncision in a Court of Appeals. If for any reason the\n2(cid:9)\nHe iis in error in stating that the Alabama agency recog-\nnized that the \"legality\" of the Department's regulation is\nnot a question to be considered in the administrative pro-\nceeding. Nowhere have we made that admission. We merely\nstated in effect that we were not naive enough to think\nthat the Department would strike down its own regulation or\nrequirement. Be that as it may, the Secretary has declined\nto pass upon any question of validity, stating that this is\nan issue to be raised before the courts.\n\nspecific statutory review provision is inadequate, then\nunder the terms of the Administrative Procedure Act itself,\na review of the Federal agency's action in promulgating \ninvalid regulations or requirements in a District Court by\ndeclaratory or injunction proceeding becomes the proper\nremedy. The fact that the State agency chose as a matter\nof precaution to await a decision on an administrative\nhearing does not, in our opinion, alter the principle.\nApparently the cases cited in the Government's\nbrief, such as Whitney Bank v. New Orleans Bank, 379 U.S.\n411, is one where, under the circumstances, the issue was\none to be decided only by an administrative body and thus\nsubject only to the special statutory review specified.\n3. Another reason for inadequacy--one already\nadvanced; no provision for judicial review for cutting off\nof funds on any ground, either before or after the passage\nof the Civil Rights Act, has been provided by the Social\nSecurity Act in the case of the Child Welfare Service.\nThis is admitted by the Government, but the Government\nargues that because the administration of the five pro-\ngrams, and especially the programs involving children, are\n\nso intertwined or interwoven, this would confer authority\nupon the Court of Appeals for a statutory review. We say\nthis cannot logically result. Nothing can confer juris-\ndiction upon a Court of Appeals to review, in connection\nwith any program unless there is an express statutory pro-\nvision therefor. One of the cases cited in the Government's\nbrief, Fletcher v. United States Atomic Energy Commission,\n15.2 F.2d 29, refutes the Government's contention in that\nregard. We quote from 152 F.2d 32:\n\"If what the petitioners sought was 'just\ncompensation,' the petition for review\nmust be denied at the threshold because\nwe have no power to review a Commission\ndecision on that subject. One aggrieved\nthereby may sue the United States in the\nCourt of Claims or in a district court,\nbut he may not come to us for review. In\nthe fact of these statutory provisions,\nwe are not inclined to assert the power\nto review the Commission's decision con-\ncerning 'just compensation' in this case\nmerely because the same petitioners\nsimultaneously seek review of the\nCommission's decision concerning an\n'award' of which we have jurisdiction.'\n[underscoring ours]\nAt the time the State filed its suit in the\nDistrict Court, there was only one order in effect (as there\nis now) for the cutting off of funds, a composite order of\n\nthe Secretary applying to all programs. If these programs\nwere so interwoven that the administration of one depended\nupon the other, as our affidavit evidence on the preliminary\ninjunction tended to show, this, in our opinion, clearly\ndemonstrated the inadequacy of any statutory remedy con-\nferring special jurisdiction upon a particular court in\nconnection with only a part of the program; and under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act, if such inadequacy exists,\nthe parties are clearly relegated to the District Court\nunder the general but clear provisions of §703, et seq.,\nTitle 5, U.S.C.\n4. We now come to a discussion of the point which\nhas not been emphasized before, a point raising the question:\nDid §603 of Title VI, providing for judicial review, encom-\npass specific provisions for judicial review enacted after \nthe passage of Title VI? The first sentence of §603 is as\nfollows:\n\"Any department or agency action taken pur-\nsuant to section 602 shall be subject to\nsuch judicial review as may otherwise be \nprovided by law for similar action taken\nby such department or agency on other\ngrounds.\" [underscoring ours]\n\nThe second sentence provides that in case of action\nnot otherwise subject to judicial review, \"any person ag-\ngrieved (including any State or political subdivision thereof\nand any agency of either) may obtain judicial review under\nSection 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, and such\naction shall not be deemed committed to unreviewable agency\ndiscretion.\"\nThe provisions of the Social Security Act pro-\nviding for review of Secretary's action cutting off the\nfunds \"on other grounds\", were enacted after the passage of\nthe Civil Rights Act. These provisions are contained in\n42 U.S.C., §1316, enacted on July 30, 1965. They provide\nfor the cutting off of funds by the Secretary under any of\nfour programs which Alabama had under the Social Security\nAct, but only on the ground that the State has failed to\nfollow, or has deviated from, the terms of the plan sub-\nmitted by the State and approved by HEW, or has so changed\nthe plan as to make it conflict with a particular section\nof the Social Security Act, having nothing to do with the\nCivil Rights Act (already enacted).\n\nWhen Congress inserted in the Civil Rights Act of\n1964 a general provision for judicial review which should\nbe applicable under many laws providing for financial\nassistance, and stated that a judicial review should be\nfollowed where provided for on \"similar action\" on other\ngrounds, surely Congress intended this to apply only to\njudicial review provisions that had already been inserted\nunder various laws. We quote from Senator Ribicoff (110\nCongressional Record 6337-6344, Daily ed., April 7, 1964):\n\"For example, Public Law 815 and the Hill-\nBurton Act - 20 United States Code 641(b),\n42 United States Code 291(j) - provide for\nspecial review procedures for denial of a\ngrant and for withholding of funds there-\nunder. The same procedures would be\nfollowed under title VI. If no review is\nprovided by existing law, altpcy action \ncutting off financial assistance would be\nsubject to judicial review in 'any applica-\nble form of legal action' as authorized by\nthe Administrative Procedure Act, 5 United\nStates Code 1009. What that means in\npractical terms is that a suit for\ninjunction or declaratory judgment could\nbe brought in the U. S. District Court.\nUnder recent amendment to the Judicial\nCode, the suit could be maintained either\nin the district where the plaintiff\nresides or where the cause of action\narose - 20 United States Code supplement\n1963 1391(e).\" [underscorin3 ours]\n- 13 -\n\nA reading of sections 304, 604, 1204, and 1354 (applying to\nthe four programs involved), will show that this is true.\nSenator Ribicoff (who was ably assisting Senator\nPastore, who was floor leader for Title VI, spoke if review\nunder other statutes under \"existing law\", and this term was\nalso used by Senator Pastore. Senator Ribicoff used the\nHill-Burton Act as an example. At the time of passage of\nthe Civil Rights Act there was a special provision under\nthe Hill-Burton Act. We think that the only logical con-\nclusion that can be drawn is that Congress intended only to\nprovide as a means of judicial review under the Civil Rights\nAct a provision under then existing laws for similar action\non other grounds, under various financial assistance acts.\nAt that time, remedies already existing under various\nstatutes would necessarily be for a cutoff on \"other grounds\",\nfor the reason that the Civil Rights Act had not been passed\n(at the time the judicial review remedies were inserted under\nother laws), and there would not have been any specific pro-\nvisions for cutoff because of racial discrimination, hence\nthe insertion of the phrase \"on other grounds\" in Section\n603, Title VI.\n- 14 -\n\nHowever, is it conceivable that Congress in later \namending the Social Security Act to provide for a judicial\nreview of a cutoff of funds (where before there had been\nnone) on the sole grounds stated in Sections 304, 604, 1204,\nand 1354, of Title 42, for example, that a state agency had\ndeviated from its approved plan, would have omitted in the\namendment the specific ground of specific violation of the\nCivil Rights Act, a ground of which both HEW and Congress\nwere necessarily fully conscious. It appears to us that\nwhere Congress later passes a law providing for cut off of\nfunds on other grounds, without mentioning discrimination\nunder the Civil Rights Act, it cannot be logically said that\nCongress intended such a judicial review to apply to a\nground that it did not mention. If this premise is sound,\nthen there is no remedy for review in this Court, adequate\nor inadequate, and the sole remedy is in the District Court.\nHowever, as before stated and without regard to\nthis premise, under the principles enunciated in these recent\nSupreme Court decisions, as we construe them, the State would\nbe afforded a review of the final action of the Federal agency\nin promulgating excessive and invalid regulations or rules\n- 15 -\n\nand in ordering a cut-off of funds for failure of the State\nagency to comply therewith, irrespective of the administrative\nhearing ,in the District Court.\n5. Mention should be made of the fact of joinder\nby amendment of individual beneficiaries of Alabama's Welfare\nPrograms as parties plaintiff by class suit, both Negro and\nwhite, since Section 603 of Title VI affords a judicial\nreview to every \"person aggrieved\" by the action of the\nFederal agency. Dealing with the question of the remedy,\nthese beneficiaries certainly had no right of appeal or re-\nview under Section 1316, Title 42, and their only recourse\nwould be in the District Court. It is realized that they\nwere not made appellees and that on the injunction hearing\n3\nAn additional statement made by the Secretary in his\nOrder of January 12, 1967, pertaining to his inability or\nunwillingness to consider the legality of the Regulation,\nis shown on page 305, Vol. II, Appendix to the Secretary's\nbrief, as follows:\n\"As stated earlier the legality of the Regu-\nlation will not be considered in this pro-\nceeding and the expressed intention of the\nAlabama agency to seek judicial review of\nthis Regulation will not be accepted in\nlieu of compliance with the Regulation.\"\n[underscoring ours]\n- 16 -\n\nthe District Court did not adjudicate the propriety of their\njoinder or standing to sue. Nevertheless, they were and are\npresent in the case on appeal from the District Court and\nwhatever rights they have may be relevant to a consideration\nof the question of jurisdiction.\n6. We have asked leave to submit this additional\nmemorandum solely because we realize that this Court must\ndecide the jurisdictional questions involved, although the\nquestion, or questions, should not affect the overall result\nof the Court's decision. That this is true is recognized\nin the Government's brief on page 30, by the statement that\nin the present posture of the case this Court is permitted\nto reach the \"substantive issue of this case\"--\"because of\nthe consolidation of the appeal with Alabama's alternative\npetition for review.\"\nWe cannot conceive of a holding that the District\nCourt would not have jurisdiction in connection with\nAlabama's Child Welfare Service Program, and should this\nCourt decide that this Court is due to entertain jurisdiction\non the alternative petition review as to the other four pro-\ngrams, this would mean that the District Court had  jurisdiction\n- 17 -\n\nof part of the case and this Court the other part. In any\nevent, the entire case is now before this Court.\nBRIEF COMMENTS RELATING TO THAT WHICH\nTRANSPIRED DURING THE ORAL ARGUMENT \n7. As we understood Mr. Owen Piss, the esteemed\nattorney representing the Department of Justice and the\nGovernment at the hearing, the Government in effect seeks\nonly an interpretation (or he may have said agreement),\nthat the State Department in complying with the law and\nregulations, or giving an assurance of compliance, need\nonly ac-: in good faith, or put forth its efforts to obtain\nor to persuade the third parties, such as physicians,\nnursing homes, church homes, etc.,(all private businesses\nor institutions) to refrain from discrimination (we do not\npretend to quote the words used, and if we are not correct\nin any sense, we will stand corrected). We expressed sur-\nprise at the statement, regardless of the intended meaning,\nand certainly felt surprised. We stated that was the first\ntime we had heard such words from any representative of the\nGovernment, and according to the record before this Court,\n\nthe writer of this brief had participated in the admini-\nstrative hearing in October, 1965, as well as conferences\nduring the preceding month (as well as personal presentation\nbefore the Commissioner of Welfare in June, 1966). In any\ncase, we can only say that our position has been, and is\nnow, that the regulation, particularly as to third parties,\ntaken in connection with the so-called implementing form\n(page 158A-150C, Vol. I, Appendix to the Secretary's brief)\nare too stringent (I believe that a member of the Court\nstated that this might be true, although nothing that was\nsaid by any member of the panel was taken by us as any indi-\ncation of what the Court will hold). In our opinion, the\nState Department should not be required to do more than to\ntry, or persuade, or to act in good faith, no matter what\nthe appropriate language may be, and should continue to\nreceive Federal funds even though it tries and fails, and\nshould not be under the onus of dispensing with the ser-\nvices of the private physicians, and the other private\ninstitutions mentioned merely because any might refuse to\ngo as far as the Government thinks they should go.\n\nThe State should not have its funds cut off if\nit tries and fails, provided there is no actual discrimi-\nnation by the State against any class of beneficiaries,\nwhite or Negro.\nIt has been stated before by the highest authority\nin the State that the State upon judicial review will com-\nply with the decision of the Court (without waiving right\nof appeal), pertaining to what it must do in order that\nFederal funds not be withheld from its two thousand or more\nneedy recipients, but it should not be required to take any\nstep other than what shall be \"consistent with achievement\nof objectives\" of the Social Security Act providing Federal\nfinancial assistance.\nRespectfully submitted,\n-D.\nv\nREID B.

PSD-79 Revised, in APTD, ADC, and TA.\n2. PA-701 Revised or PSD-07 Revised, in AB.\nDo not refer a person for a medical examination unless\nhe appears to meet other eligibility requirements. Usually\nthis is af:er the home visit. Before the department of\npensions anf security can pay for the cost of an examination\nas an adminLstrative expense, a person must take advantage\nof free pul-lic or private diagnostic facilities. If free\nfacilities are not available, a person has the right to\nselect any Legally licensed physician of his choice. Legal-\nly licensef physician refers to a doctor of medicine or to\nan osteopatilic physician. In AB, he may select either an\napproved c71-sthalmologist or a legally licensed, qualified\noptometris:.\nI. Aid t: Dependent Children and TemporaKy Aid\nIn tlies-e two categories, a person's disability must be\ndeterellned by one of the following methods:\nA. T'ee diagnosis of a legally licensed physician; or\nB. An external handicap clearly obvious to the worker,\ns..:th as paralysis or amputated limbs.\nIf a --eysician's diagnosis is necessary, previous\nexam notions are acceptable if they clearly establish\ncurre7: disability. Written medical reports or copies\nof mefical records from hospitals, clinics,  vas, VA,\nindus:rial organizations, or written statements from\n1\n\nlegally licensed physicians are sufficient.\nIf disability cannot be established by one of the above\nmethods, the applicant/recipient must have a current\nexamination by a legally licensed physician.\nIn ADC, if a parent's incapacity is temporary or partial,\nreinvestigate the case as often as necessary to deter-\nmine the parent's ability to assume financial support.\nII. Aid to the Blind \nA. Definition of Blindness -- A person is considered\nblind who has no vision, or whose vision with\ncorrecting glasses is so defective as to prevent\nthe performance of ordinary activities for which\neyesight is essential. Central visual acuit y of\n20/200 or less in the better eye with correcting\nglasses is considered as economic blindness. A\nperson, however, may be considered blind if his\ncentral visual acuity is more than 2C/200 in the\nbetter eye with correcting glasses but a rough\ntest shows him to have a marked field defect.\nThe marked field defect is one in which the\nperipheral field has contracted to such an extent\nthat the widest diameter of the visual field sub-\ntends an angular distance no greater than 20 de-\ngrees.\nB. ENe Examinations -- AB shall not be granted to any\nperson until:\n1. He has been examined by:\na. A legally qualified ophthalmologist; or\nb. A legally licensed, qualified optometrist.\n2. The county director has received the State Super-\nvising Ophthalmologist's approval of the eye\nexamination*.  * *\n- \n2 -\n\n• -.1:ifikiiiIMEIZCZETA.W\nSECTION IV\nDETERhINATION CF INCOME AND OTHER RESOURCES\nI.(cid:9) General Information\nUnder State and Federal laws, all the income and other\nresources of a person must be considered in determining\nhis need. Policies outlined later explain exemptions\nin AB and the allowable reserve in all categories,\nexcept TA.\nSince income and other resources vary considerably,\ninvestigate them carefully in cooperation with the\napplicant/recipient. The policies and procedures re-\nlating to income/resources apply to applicants, re-\ncipients, and other persons included in the ADC or TA\nbudget. They also apply to an ineligibl e spouse living\nin the home with an cpplicant/recioiient.\nPSD-113, Revised, \"Statement of Income/Resources and\nCertain Needs, Aid to Dependent Children\", must be\ncompleted at least every six months. Income/resources\nmust be verified for both initial and continuing eligi-\nbility. It must be completed by parent(s) with whom\nthe children live and must also contain information\nabout the children's income. A needy grantee (and\nhis spouse) other than parent, if in the budget, must\ncomplete PSD-113 for himself and the children. A\ngrantee relative not included in the budget must com-\nplete the form for the children only.\n(See form and instructions in Part II of the manual.)\nPSD-137, Revised, \"Statement of Applicant/Recipient on\nEligibility Factors, Adult Categories,\" must be com-\npleted by every applicant./recipient and spouse living\nwith him at least once every 12 months. For initial\neligi bility, all information on the form must be veri-\nfied. For continuing eligibility, the information will\nnot be verified unless there is reason to question it\nae-hnl-ess-ehe-ease-is-41nelude(1--ili-lle-spe8-eheelt. [Rev.\n23, See A.L. 2235, 2-6-67, Effective 1-1-67] (See form\n3\n\nand instructions in Part II of the manual.)\nIt is the duty of a public assistance applicant/recip-\nient to conserve his resources and to utilize his\nassets to meet his own needs insofar as possible. He\nshould cooperate reasonably in carrying out agency\npolicies. After being informed of ways to use his re-\nsources and ways to cooperate, if he still  does not\ncomply and elic2;ibilit cannot be established, aid will\nbe denied or discontinued on the basis of his failure\nto comply. The case can be reconsidered if the person\nlater complies with agency policy.\nII.!Real Property\nAccording to State laws, real property includes land\nor city or village lots and all buildings or other\nattachments which would pass to a buyer if the land or\nlots were sold. By policy, however, a boat, trailer,\netc., used as a home is considered real property.\nEstablish whether each applicant, recipient, spouse\n(and other persons in an ADC or TA budget) owns real\nproperty. If a person owns property in more than one\ncounty or state, make necessary verifications outside\nthe county of residence. This may be done by the\napplicant/recipient or by the worker through a public\nagency.\nJoint ownership will be treated as if it were outright\nownership. That is, consider the net value of the\napplicant's/recipient's share of jointly owned proper-\nty.\nA life interest, despite its value, will not be a bar.\nThe person, couple, or family will be expected to\nutilize the property to the maximum extent consistent\nwith legal rights to income from the property and the\nagency's utilization policies. A person with a life\ninterest is entitled to all income from the property.\nHe cannot sell timber on the property but he may\n- 4 -\n\nutilize a reasonable amount of it for his own use,\nsuch as for stove wood or repairs to the buildings.\nHe is entitled to cultivate the land and sell the\ncrops or to receive rent from the land. (refer to\n\"Other Real Property\" later.)\nThe above policy of not barring a person with a life\ninterest only is based on the fact that he cannot sell\nthe property without the consent of those who can exer-\ncise ownership rights upon his death. Should a person\nsell his life interest in property, his equity will be\nconsidered a resource. Submit to the Bureau of Field\nService the age of the individual and the total net\nproceeds received from the property for computation\nof the value of the life estate.\n*\n(cid:9)\n* (cid:9)\nIS\n\nSECTION XI\nMEDICAL CARE PROGRAMS\nIn Alabama the four types of medical services for which\nvendor payments are made from State and Federal funds are:\n(1) medical assistance for the aged not eligible for old age\npensions; (2) medicalcare for old age pension recipients;\n(3) care in a licensed nursing home (or cerebral palsy treat-\nment center) in all categories; and (4) medical care in the\nADC-FFC program. In this section are given the services\nprovided and the policies and procedures for carrying them\nout.\nI.(cid:9) Medical Assistance for the Aged Proe4rem\nLegal Das.\nAuthority to establish a program to provide medi-\ncal assistance to Alabama residents G5 years or\nolder who are not receiving old age pensions is\ncontained in Title 49, Sections 51(7)-51(15),\nCode of Alabama, 1940, as amended. This law gives\nthe State Department of Pensions and Security\nbroad powers in setting up and administering the\nmedical assistance to the aged (MAA) program.\nThe Federal Government permits a State public\nassistance agency to contract with another agency\nto handle the medical aspects of the program.\nThe State Department of Pensions and Security\nhas accordingly entered into an agreement with\nthe State Health Department to assume specified\nresponsibilities with reference to medical as-\npects of the program.\nB. Summary of Medical Services Provided\nHospitalization and physicians' fees are the ser-\nvices provided under this program. The hospital\nprogram is designed to pay only that part of the\nhospital per diem cost not covered by insurance\n- 0 -\n\nand/or third party payments.\nC. Application Process\n1. When and How Applications Are Made -- Appli-\ncation for MAA should be made to fee county\ndepartment of pensions and security in the\ncounty in which the person is residing. It\nshould be made at the time hospitalization is\nneeded, or when it appears that he-=Pitalization\nwill be needed within the next 30 says. How-\never, if a person wishes to apply fer MAA, even\nthough hospitalization is not antizipated\nwithin the next 30 days, his application will\nbe accepted. It will be denied unless the\napplicant presents evidence that :e:spitali-\nzation is needed or will be needed 75..thin the\nnext 33 days.\nApplication may be made by the applicant or\nby someone in his behalf. It may :e made in\nthe office, in the hospital, in t'ee patient's\nhome, or by telephone or mail. --eenever\npossible, the applicant will be interviewed.\nIf he is too ill to be interviewee: er lives\nin a remote area where travel is =possible\nat the time of processing the apeleeation, it\nmay be necessary to arrange for a: interview\nby telephone with him, or for a peesonal or\ntelephone interview with a pers.= :eoresenting\nhim, such as a relative, neighber lector ; or\nnurse. Also, if there is a proPee signature\non PSD-126, this is acceptable as an appli\ncation should the patient die be:::e PSD-125\nis completed.\nApplications for MAA and CAP cannel be ap-\nproved concurrently unless the 11-, =replication\nis for services rendered the pre-.- __es month.\nA reapplication will be taken ae _e:e time a\nperson wishes to reapply and will e-e handled\n\nin the same way as a new application. Another\nPSD-125 MAA, \"Application and Statement on\nFactors of Eligibility,\" must be completed at\ntime of re-application, even though the appli-\ncant's circumstances may be the sane.\nThe county in which the hospital is located\nwill accept the application for MAA. The\napplication will then be forwarded to the\ncounty of the applicant's residence. An\napplicant should always be asked if he has\nlived in another county and if PSD has paid\nfor hospitalization in his behalf. If he is\nan active case in another county, that county\nwill authorize his hospitalization. The\ncounty where an application is approved will\nkeep the case open until the period of eligi-\nbility expires. Then the person can apply in\nhis new county of residence if he again needs\nhospitalization.\n(See \"E\", \"Eligibility,\" for eligibility re-\nquirements and form to be completed.)\n*\nG. Services Provided\nWithin a fiscal year (October 1 through September\n30), each eligible person may receive 30 days\nhospitalization and the maximum in physicians'\nservices as determined by the State Department of\nPensions and Security. Hospital days not used in\none fiscal year cannot be carried over to the\nnext year.\n1. Hospitalization -- Hospitalization will be pro-\nvided for treatment of acute illnesses or major\ninjuries which cannot be treated adequately\noutside a hospital. Acute illnesses or acute\nmedical conditions shall include acute\n- 3 -\n\nexacerbations or acute complications of\nchronic diseases, surgical conditions requiring\nemergency hospitalization, contagious diseases\nwhich may respond to short-term remedial care,\nand acute emergencies of any nature which are\na threat to the life and health of the patient.\nHospitalization will not be provided for ill-\nnesses or injuries which can be treated ade-\nquately on an out-patient basis or which\nrequire only domiciliary care, or for which\ntreatment is available from the State, Federal,\nor local governments or private organizations\nunder another program. In an emergency situ-\nation when a patient is eligible for admission\nto a VA Hospital, etc., PSD can pay for hospi-\ntalization in a participating hospital.\nTransfer should be made to the public facility\nas soon as it is medically feasible.\nHospitalization can be provided for elective\ncataract surgery if the county department\nestablishes that treatment is not available\nfrom some other source and for diagnosed can-\ncer cases if the State Health Department\nestablishes that treatment is not available\nfrom some other source.\nA \"participating hospital\" means a hospital\nof 15 or more beds licensed by the State\nHealth Department and which has entered into\na written agreement with the State Health\nDepartment to participate in the medical as-\nsistance for the aged program. The physician\nwill make the decision as to the type accom-\nmodation which the patient requires. If a\npatient's condition is such that he can receive\nadequate medical care only in a private room,\nhis physician will arrange for this type room.\nIf, however, some other type accommodation is\nconsistent with adequate medical treatment,\nthis is acceptable.\n- V\n\nThe patient's physician will certify that\nhospitalization is needed for acute illness\nor injury. (The patient shall have freedom\nto choose his own physician.) It shall be\nthe sole responsibility of the patient's\nphysician in consultation with the patient,\nhis guardian, spouse, adult child, or other\nperson representing the patient to determine\nthe participating hospital to which the\npatient is to be admitted. (The decision to\naccept the patient rests with the hospital.)\n2 PlaaLian's Fees -- The State Department of\nPensions and Security will pay the patient's\nprivate physician (legally licensed doctor of\nmedicine or an osteopathic physician) fees in\nthe amounts given below for services rendered\nwithin 30 days following the patient's dis-\ncharge from the hospital. The services must\nbe related to the hospitalization or to con-\nditions which develop and are directly or in-\ndirectly related to the hospitalization.\na. A maximum total payment of $15 for seeing.\nthe patient at home (including a nursing\nhome) or at his office and a maximum of\n$5 for each of •these visits.\nb. Maximums for the services given below\n(these are in addition to fees for the\nroutine visits in (1) above).\nElectrocardiogram(cid:9) $ 7.50\nBlood examinations for progress\nevaluation(cid:9) $ 5.00\nX-ray evaluation of conditions\nfor which hospitalization\nwas provided(cid:9) $15.00\n- 10 -\n\nPhysician's visits not used after one period\nof hospitalization cannot be added to those to\nwhich the patient is entitled following a\nsecond period of hospitalization.\nThe physician who wishes to receive payment\nthrough the IdAA program must agree not to make\nan additional charge to the patient or third\nparty for any visit for which he presents a\nclaim to the department of pensions and secur-\nity. If he has received or is to receive any\npayments for these particular visits, in pre-\nsenting his claim to this department, he must\nlist any payments actually received or to be\nreceived from the patient, insurance, or third\nparty funds. (PSD cannot pay anything on any\nvisit or for any other service for which in-\nsurance pays the maximum fee allowed by PSD.)\nThe physician is not prohibited from charging\nthe patient for services rendered in other\noffice or home visits before, during, or\nfollowing hospitalization.\nWhen a hospital claim has been filed with the\nState Health Department, payments to physicians\nfor post-hospital care may be made not only\nwhen per diem costs are paid by the State De-\npartment of Pensions and Security but also if\nthe per diem costs have been met by insurance,\nby the recipient, or by third party funds. No\npayment of physician's fees shall be made\nfollowing hospitalization which is not approved\nby the State Health Department.\nThe State Health Department will verify and\napprove claims for a physician's services.\nbased on its determination that: (a) the\nclaimant is a physician; (b) the amount of\nclaim does not exceed the fee schedule which\nis in effect at the time the service is given;\n\n(c) the appropriate certification by the\nphysician is on the claim; and (d) the ser-\nvices have been provided within the specified -\nperiod.\n\nIII. Care for Adults in a Licensed Nursing Home\nThis item includes care in a nursing, rest, or con-\nvalescent home, or in a cerebral palsy treatment\ncenter. Before considering such institutional care,\nhelp the person try to make suitable arrangements in\nhis home, in the home of relatives or non-related\npersons, or in a personal care home. Do not pay for\nthe care of any recipient who enters a licensed\nnursing home unless the county department partici-\npates in the plan, with the following exception.\nException: In case of emergency, upon the recom-\nmendation of a physician, plans may have to be made\nbefore other arrangements can be explored.\nA. Persons for Whom the Item May Be Budfzeted\nWhen other plans cannot be made, budget nursing\nhome care for the following persons:\n1. Those who are bedfast or chairfast.\n2. Those who are so physically ill or so dis-\nabled that they cannot live alone on a\ncontinuing basis without attendant or nursing\nservice from another person.\n3. Those who have a mental impairment (but not\npsychosis) which makes regular supervision\nand care from another person necessary.\nIn ADO, nursing home care can be granted for an\nadult in the budget for a temporary period only,\nusually not to exceed three months.\nB. Procedures When Nursing Home Care Is Indicated\n1. A legally licensed physician, preferably the\none most familiar with the person's medical\nneeds, must recommend the care.\n\nPlyanLsjrom State and Federal Funds\nAll regular public aid payments must be made by checks\npayable on demand, at par, drawn by the State Department\nthrough its appointed bonded disbursing official.\nRegular money payments are made in the name of the\nrecipient (includes parent or brother or sister of mentally\nhandicapped minor in AB and APTD and grantee-relative in\nADC) and mailed to him or to his legal guardian. The money\npayment principle recognizes that a recipient of aid does\nnot, because he is in need, lose his capacity to manage his\nown affairs. These payments must not be restricted as to\ntheir use. The examples below illustrate restricted money\npayments and are to be used as a guide by county depart-\nments.\n1. Directing that all or part of the payment must\nbe applied to specific bills or for the purchase\nof specific goods or services. (Statements to\nrecipients explaining the basis on which the\namount of the payment is determined are not in\nthemselves restrictive.)\n2. Requiring that the recipient submit receipts\nfor the purpose of showing how he has spent all\nor any part of his payment.\n3. Requiring the return to the agency, or deposit\nwith the agency, of all or part of the payment\nfor use in a manner designated by the agency.\n4. Providing services to recipient's creditors,\nsuch as assisting them in the collection of the\nrecipient's debts.\nOAP may be paid to an individual within the month he\nreaches his 65th birthday, if all points of eligibility\nhave been established. ADC may be paid to a family for the\nmonth in which a child reaches his 13th birthday, unless\n\nNO 244G3\n.ro 2 4 5:\n2=7,::::,7;7:277=====\":..=\nC7 A21=\nL 3.-.1 Le -L\n4...^:\"\"1\",,atd\nmac:a, SEC22TARY OF THE UNITED STA.!.

Exhibit A contains Secretary Gardner's\ndecision or action, dated January 12, 1967,\ndirecting the cutting off of welfare funds\nof the Alabama State Department, and is re-\nproduced on page 273, Volume II, of the\nAppendix to Secretary Gardner's Brief.\nSaid action of the Secretary is also shown\nat page 16 of the printed record in No.\n24468.\n2. Exhibit B to the Petition contains the\noriginal complaint filed in the United\nStates District Court, Northern District\nof Alabama, and is shown at page 6 of the\nprinted record on appeal in No. 24468.\n3. Exhibit C to the Petition contains an\namendment filed to the complaint, which\nis shown at page 48 of the printed record\nin No. 24468 (it is erroneously stated in\nthe index to such printed record that it\nis contained on page 60).\n4. Exhibit D contains the Decree of the United\nStates District Court, Northern District of\nAlabama, granting a preliminary injunction,\nincluding findings of fact and conclusions\nof law, and is shown at page 77 of the\nprinted record in No. 24468 (it is errone-\nously stated in the index to such printed\nrecord as being at page 87).\n5. Exhibit E contains Secretary Gardner's\nanswer to the complaint, and is shown at\npage 73 of the printed record in No. 24468.\n\n6. Exhibit F contains the Notice of Appeal by\nSecretary Gardner to this Court from the\ndecree granting the motion of the State of\nAlabama for a preliminary injunction. It\nis shown at page 88 of the printed record\nin No. 24468 (erroneously stated in the\nindex as being shown at page 98).\nAll of these Exhibits are attached to the original\npetition on file with this Court.\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\nFOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\nPETITION OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA \nPetitioner, State of Alabama, shows unto this Court\nthe following:\n1. On January 12, 1967, the Secretary of the Depart-\nment of Health, Education and Welfare of the United States\nrendered a decision, directive or order, a true copy of\nwhich is attached at the end of this petition as Exhibit A\nand made a part hereof. On January 13, 1967, the State\nof Alabama (in the capacity in which it is named in the\naction) filed a suit against Honorable John W. Gardner,\nsaid Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, praying\nfor, among other things, a judicial review of said deci-\nsion of January 12, 1967, and a permanent and temporary\ninjunction against the carrying into effect of such deci-\nsion, and other relief, all as shown by the complaint in\nsaid action, filed in the United States District Court,\nNorthern District of Alabama, Southern Division, a true\ncopy of which is attached to this petition as Exhibit B\n(Exhibits to complaint omitted). On January 16, 1967, an\n\namendment was filed to said complaint, a true copy of which\nis attached to this petition as Exhibit C. Thereupon a\nhearing was set in said United States District Court on the\nprayer for motion for preliminary injunction as of Wednes-\nday, February 1, 1967, and on February 3, 1967, there was\nrendered in and by said United States District Court a\ndecree granting a preliminary injunction against said\nSecretary of Health, Education and Welfare, his officers,\nagents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and others\nacting in active concert or participation with him, against\nthe carrying into effect of said decision or order of\nJanuary 12, 1967, a true copy of which decree is attached\nto this petition as Exhibit D and made a part hereof.\n2. Prior to the said hearing on preliminary injunc-\ntion there was filed in behalf of said Secretary of Health,\nEducation and Welfare an answer to the complaint, a true\ncopy of which is attached to this petition as Exhibit E.\n3. On February 10, 1967, the Secretary took an\nappeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth\nCircuit from said decree granting the plaintiff's motion\nfor preliminary injunction, by the filing of a notice of\nappeal, a true copy of which is attached to this petition\nas Exhibit F. The appeal is docketed in the Court of\nAppeals as No. 24468.\n2\n\n4. A contention was made in behalf of the Secretary,\ndefendant in said action, on the hearing both prior to and\non the hearing for preliminary injunction, that the District\nCourt had no jurisdiction of the action, in effect that\nthe sole judicial review for the cutting off of funds under\nfour of Alabama's welfare programs (Title I, Title IV,\nTitle X, and Title XIV, of the Social Security Act), is\nby petition to review in the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Fifth Circuit in accordance with Section 1316,\nTitle 42, United States Code Annotated; Public Law 89-97,\n75 Stat. 419.\n5. The State of Alabama asserts (and says that it is\nnot disputed) that Section 1316 makes no mention of any\nreview under Alabama's child welfare program, Title V,\nPart 3 (Child Welfare Service), of the Social Security Act,\nTitle 42, Sections 721-728. The State says that Section\n1316, Title 42, is not applicable at all to any judicial\nreview or action taken by the Secretary of Health, Educa-\ntion and Welfare under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and\nsays, in the alternative, that if it should be held that\nSection 1316 does afford judicial review for only a part\nof Alabama's welfare programs, it is inadequate because,\na\namong other reasons, such section does not authorize \n- 3 -\n\nreview of all of the programs described and involved in the\nSecretary's decision of January 12, 1967. Thus, the only\nadequate remedy or review of the cutting off of funds for\nall of the programs described in said decision of Janu-\nary 12, 1967, is by recourse to the proper United States\nDistrict Court, as a court of competent jurisdiction within\nthe meaning of Title 5, Section 703, United States Code\nAnnotated (The Administrative Procedure Act), formerly\nSection 1009, Title 5, United States Code Annotated.\n6. The State of Alabama further asserts that an\naction in the District Court is at least a concurrent rem-\nedy. The State further asserts that under the attack or\nattacks made upon the validity of the regulations, and\nrequirements, of the Department of Health, Education and\nWelfare, there is an entitlement to take new or additional\nevidence, over and above evidence taken on the admini-\nstrative hearing preliminary to the Secretary's order of\nJanuary 12, 1967, terminating and cutting off the funds\nand for that reason, among all others, any method of re-\nview in the United States Court of Appeals would be inade-\nquate.\n7. The State firmly contends that the District Court\nhas full jurisdiction of the action which it has brought\n- 4\n\nin connection with all of Alabama's welfare programs (and\nnot just the one in connection with which there is no\npossible right of review in the Court of Appeals, Title V,\nPart 3, Social Security Act; Title 42, Section 721-728,\nU.S.C.A.); but says, in the alternative, that if under the\nstatutes the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth\nCircuit has sole jurisdiction over the four welfare pro-\ngrams above named, to-wit:\nSOCIAL SECURITY ACT(cid:9) U.S.C.A. \nTitle I (Old Age Assistance and(cid:9) Title 42, §301-306\nMedical Assistance to\nthe Aged)\nTitle IV (Aid to Dependent(cid:9) Title 42, §601-606\nChildren - Alabama\nProgram)\nTitle X (Blind)(cid:9) Title 42, §1201-1206\nTitle XIV (Aid to the Total and\nPermanently Disabled)(cid:9) Title 42, §1351-1355;\nsuch a review is hereby sought and prayed for as to each\nand all of such four programs; and petitioner hereby adopts\nand assigns all of the reasons and grounds, separately and\nseverally, set forth in the complaint and the amendments\nthereto (including a second amendment to the complaint,\nfiled February 1, 1967, in the said District Court, a true\ncopy of which is attached to this petition as Exhibit G),\n\nand in addition thereto such other grounds and reasons as\nare consonant with law and justice, including the ground\nthat any cutting off of funds to needy people under the\nwelfare programs is not consistent with the objectives of\nthe Act under which financial assistance is provided.\nSTATE OF ALABAMA\nBy(cid:9) /s/ Reid B.

Gardner,\nSecretary of Health, Education and Welfare, dated Janu-\nary 12, 1967, directing the cutting-off of funds to the\nState and said State Department (such action being taken\nby order and determination made as of January 12, 1967,\n- 8 -\n\nand by its terms stated to take effect at midnight,\nFebruary 28, 1967), be postponed pending judicial review,\nand respectfully shows as follows:\nSection 705, Title 5 reads as follows:\n\"When an agency finds that justice so requires,\nit may postpone the effective date of action\ntaken by it, pending judicial review. On such\nconditions as may be required and to the extent\nnecessary to prevent irreparable injury, the\nreviewing court, including the court to which\na case may be taken on appeal from or on appli-\ncation for certiorari or other writ to a\nreviewing court, may issue all necessary and\nappropriate process to postpone the effective\ndate of an agency action or to preserve status\nor rights pending conclusion of the review\nproceedings.\"\nThis section along with the other sections of\nChapter 7 in which it is contained, apply to all forms of\njudicial review of any agency action, unless all such review\nis precluded by statute. The first sentence of 5705 autho-\nrizes each Federal Department or agency itself to postpone\nthe effective date of any action taken by it, pending\njudicial review, when it finds that justice so requires.\nAn action has been commenced by the State acting for said\ndepartment and board in the United States District Court,\nNorthern District of Alabama, Southern Division, Civil\nAction No. 67-19 (the Secretary should shortly receive a\n\ncopy of the complaint in said action, and an amendment\nthereto), seeking a review of the Secretary's said action\ntaken on January 12, 1567. It is obvious and self-evident,\nin the opinion of the undersigned that justice does require\nthe postponement of the effective date of the action in view\nof the serious and irreparable harm that will be done to the\naged persons and children receiving Federal funds for the\nState's welfare program, and in view of the importance that\nthere be a judicial review and a determination once and for\nall by the Courts of the questions involved, and the extent\nto which the Department of Health, Education and Welfare is\nempowered to go in the regulations and in its requirements.\nTherefore an earnest request is made that the\nSecretary himself postpone the effective date of his said\naction, pending any and all judicial review (it is recog-\nnized that part of the State's welfare programs may be\nsubject to review in another Court, but certainly a part,\nsuch as the child welfare services program, can be reviewed\nonly in a United States District Court since there is no\nprovision for other review--it is our position that we are\nentitled to a review of the entire action in one Court and\nto choose that Court).\n\nA request is made that action on this motion be\ntaken as promptly as possible, because of the necessity of\nseeking a Court injunction to postpone the effective date of\nthe action in the event that this motion is denied.\nRespectfully submitted,\n/s/ Reid B.

      "title": "Response of the State of Alabama to the Motion for Leave to Proceed on the Original Record",
      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\nFOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\nNo. 24468\nJOHN W. GARDNER, AS SECRETARY OP THE U. S.\nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, EDUCATION AND WELFARE\nOF THE UNITED STATES, APPELLANT\nTHE STATE OF ALABAMA, FOR AND IN BEHALF OF\nAND AS TRUSTEE FOR TIM DEPARTMENT OF PENSIONS\nAND SECURITY OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA, APPELLEE\nRESPONSE OF THE STATE OF ALABAMA TO\nTHE MOTION FOR LEAVE TO\nPROCEED ON THE ORIGINAL RECORD \nappellee the State of Alabama as above described\nThe \n(hereinafter referred to as the State) makes response to the\nmotion of appellant for leave to proceed on the original record\n(which presumably includes by reference the motion for expedited\nconsideration)\nfiled contemporaneously herewith the petition\n'of the State of Alabama which in the most capsulated form,\nnvokes the provisions of Title 42, Section 1316, U.S.C.A•\nreview by this Court, against the contingency and in the  event\nCart ShQUIddecide that the District Court does not have\nurisdictien to review: the action taken by the appellant\ncutting off of funds es to all of Alabama's welfare program or\ntry: entertain the attack madelm the DiStrict Court upon _hat\nF(cid:9) '\nand other actions taken by the appellant in connection with\nthe cutting off of fit*\nbringing of the D(cid:9) Court case into t(cid:9) Arosurt by the\nappeal taken, the whole matter i now before-this 'Court by reaibri\n\nof the filing of the petition just referred to, this should\nthis Court to reach a decision in the interest of\njustice unobstructed by technical considerations.\nThe State has no objection to a reasonably expedited\nhearing, upon the original record without printing. However,\nappellee submits that a sufficient number of unprinted copies\nshould be furnished the Court, in order to facilitate considera-\ntion and decision, of the transcript of the proceedings on the\nadministrative hearing in Washington, and of the affidavits\nintroduced as exhibits on the hearing in the District Court,\nalong with copies of the transcript of the proceedings. Attention\nis also called to the fact that the Alabama welfare program\nplans on file in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare\nin Washington were taken into consideration by the Hearing\nExaminer, but are not as yet a part of the record on this\nappeal. It has been agreed by the attorneys on both sides\nthat this can and will be furnished, as well as possibly the\ntranscript of the oral arguments made before the District Court\n(not yet filed with the Clerk of this Court), and that these\nmatters can and will be handled by cooperation among the attorneys.\nThe cut, off date fixed in the Secretary's directive\nof January 12, 1967, is February 28, 1967, as of midnight.\nHowever, the carrying into effect of this deadline date has been\nenjoined and the necessary postponement by the injunction\ngranted in the District Court, following the refusal by the\nSecretary to postpone the effective date of action himself,\npending judicial review, (as shown by the record on appeal)\nstep which he was authorized to take under Section 705, Title 5,\n\nTherefore, any hearing before this Court will\nnecessarily occur after February 28, 1967, and it therefore\nappears that there is now no necessity for an \"emergency\" decision,\nas may have been logically conceived to have been the case a\nlittle earlier in the proceeding. This statement is not\nintended to mean that appellee desires any unnecessary delay.\nThe opposite is true. The matter should not be unduly prolonged,\nbut it should not be resolved on precipitate consideration. It\nshould be resolved only after full exploration of the issues  as\nto both the facts and the law, a course the opposite of which\nwe do not for one moment envision that this Court desires to\ntake or will take. There should bee adequate time for argument,\nboth orally and by brief.\nIn the light of the motions made, and the implications\nthat might be drawn from the references in the motions to the\nfact that it has been \"almost two years\" since HEW (the Federal\nDepartment abbreviated) commenced negotiations with the Alabama\nDepartment of Pensions and Security to obtain the assurance\ndemanded, and lest such references be considered by this Court\nas urging a resolution at a critically early time, we deem\nit appropriate to point out that according to the record what\nnegotiations there were, commenced about May, 1965, and were\nconcluded before the hearing in Washington on October 21, 1965.\nThere were no negotiations thereafter as far as any knowledge\nof the writer of this motion is concerned. Although the hearing\nlasted only one day, except for briefs, the Hearing Examiner did\nnot reach a decision until April 5, 1966, over five months\nlater. Exceptions were duly filed by the State Department which\nwere heard by the Commissioner of Welfare on June 16, 1966, only\n\nupon an oral argument in Washington on that day and not upon\nthe taking of any further evidence. A period of exactly five\nmonths passed before the Commissioner, Honorable Ellen Winston,\nreached a decision on November 16, 1966, which, incidently,\nwas only a few days after the holding of the general election\nin Alabama. All of this is shown by the record. The Secretary\nhas expressed himself as deploring the necessity of cutting off\nthe welfare funds at all, so we take it that the question of\neither spending or saving money depending upon the time of\nthe determination of the issues, is not a factor for considera-\ntion whatsoever. Many statements that are in the Congressional\nRecord, made by Senator Pastore and Senator Ribicoff, both of\nwhom were charged with the responsibility as Floor Leaders\nfor Title VI of presenting the matter to the Senate, which\ntime does not permit us here to quote, but which will be\nreferred to later upon the argument, emphasize that the purpose\nof Title VI was not punitive and was not to cut off funds, but to\ndo so only as a last resort.\nAlso time does not permit a substantial argument\nin this response on the merits of the case, and for that reason\nwe deplore the fact that the Department of Justice has seen fit\nto present such an argument on the motion for expedition.\nWe think any intimation that this Court should summarily\nor without the expenditure of much time or thought dispose of\nthis case because there is really nothing to it should have\nbeen studiously avoided on this motion (by this we intend no\ncriticism as far as the motives of the esteemed attorneys on the\nother side are concerned); but because of the comments made,\nincluding a statement that there can be no 'doubt' that the\n\nregulations and the actions sought to be taken by the Secretary\nvalid, we ask leave to make brief references to the\nCongressional Record involving the legislative history of Title\nVI, which relate only to a principal question, and not by any\nmeans to all the principal questions, that is, whether the\naction of the Secretary directing the cutting off of funds, as\ndintinguished from'bther means authorized by law\" (Section 602,\nTitle VI, Civil Rights Act), should have been employed at all.\nThe first quotation is from Senator Ribicoff:\n\"The remedies provided by section 602 are with-\nholding of assistance and any other means\nauthorized by law. In general, the consistent-\nwith-the-objectives requirement would make\nwithholding of funds a last resort, to be used\nonly when other means authorized by law were\nunavailable or ineffective.\n\"To make that clear: The witholding of funds\nwould be the last step to be taken only after\nthe administrator or the agency had used every\nother possible means to persuade or to influence\nthe person or the agency offending to stop the\ndiscrimination.\n\"Seventh. Looking first to the 'other means \nauthorized by law,' the agency could, for\nexample, ask the Attorney General to initiate\na lawsuit under Title IV, if the recipient\nwere a school district or public college; or\nthe agency could use any of the remedies avilable\nto it by virtue of its own 'rule, regulation,\nor order of general applicability.' For example,\nthe most effective way for an agency to proceed\nwould often be to adopt a rule that made the\nnondiscrimination requirement part of a contractual\nobligation on the part of the recipient. Then\nviolation of such a requirement would normally\ngive the agency the right to bring a lawsuit to\nenforce its own contract; or, in the absence of \na technical contract, the agency would have\nauthority to sue to enforce compliance with its \nown regulations. (cid:9) of these remedies have the\nobvious advantage of seeking to end the discri-\nmination, rather than to end the assistance.\"\n[Underscoring supplied]\n(110 Con. Rec. 6846-6847, daily ed., April 7,\n1964--Note: We do not have the final page number,\nbut will attempt to supply this at the proper time.)\n\n(cid:9)\nWe next quote from Senator Saltonstall of Massachusetts:\n\"Furthermore, it is important to note that\nsection 602 states that any rules or regulations\nestablished to effectuate the provisions of\nthis title 'shall be consistent with\nachievement of the objectives of the statute\nauthorizing the financial assistance.' Thus,\nwhere Federal funds are used to feed needy\nchildren through a program which is operated\non a segregated basis, this section does not \nintend that the children be deprived of the \nfood because the administrators of ths_program\nare violating the law. However, we cannot\njustify the expenditure of Federal funds\ncollected from all citizens on programs which\nare being administered in a way which clearly\ndeprives some of them of the equal protection\nof the laws.\"\n[Underscoring supplied]\n(110 Con. Rec.--Senate, Number 11, page 12263)\nSenator Saltonstall was, as we understand it, the\nChairman of the Bi-Racial Senate Conference whipping the final\nversion of the substitute into effect, as finally passed, and\nmade the above statement shortly before the passage. This\nstatement, we submit is entitled to great weight.\nIt appears to us that the above quotations should\nsuffice to create at least a glimmer of doubt in the minds of\n.even the most skeptical and the most partisan, without regard to\nthe other substantial issues involved.\nWe reiterate: We do not oppose a reasonably expedited\nhearing, and, in fact, we state that we will cooperate to that\nend. We submit that because of the volumes of words that were\nspoken and which have a bearing upon the legislative history of\nfor other reasons, all relating to the importance\nof the issues to be decided, necessarily time should be allowed\n•\nfor the submission of comprehensive briefs and argument.\n,Gallon Respectfully submitted,\ntoo tan(cid:9) of Alabama\nSTATE OF ALABAMA\noral.\n(cid:9)By: (cid:9)\nSpecial.

Vol. II,\n21\npp. 285-287].(cid:9) The Alabama Department's primary\ncontention is that the regulation is invalid.\nThe District Court on February 3, 1967, granted\na preliminary injunction restraining the Secretary from\nterminating, under his order, any federal financial\nassistance to the Alabama Department [R. 86]. We filed\nthis appeal and Alabama petitioned for direct review of\nthe Secretary's order in this Court, since the Secretary\nclaimed not only that his order was valid, but that\njurisdiction to review his order was exclusive in the\nCourt of Appeals. Thus this consolidated proceeding--\nthe SecretaryJs appeal and Alabama's petition for review makes\npossible consideration of the substantive issue in this case --\n21 \"R\" refers to the printed record. \"A\" Vol. I or\nVol. II refers to Appellant-Respondent's Appendix.\n- 3 -\n\nthe validity of the HE[I regulation--regardless of\nthis Court's disposi_tinn of the jurisdictional\nissue.

Title VI and the Regulation Prohib jtin Racial\nDiscrimination. Section 601 of Title VI of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 provides that \"no person\nin the United States shall, on the grounds of race,\ncolor, or national origin, be excluded from\nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be\nsubjected to discrimination under any program or\nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance,\"\nSection 60? directs \"[e]ach Federal department or\nagency which is empowered to extend Federal financial\nassistance to any program or activity, by way of\nP(cid:9) grant, loan, or contract other than a contract of\ninsurance or guaranty, 00 ,to effectuate the pro-\nvisions of section 601...by issuing rules, regu-\nlations, or orders of general applicability,.,.\"\n- 4_,\n\nPursuant to the congressional r iithori_7ati.on\nand directive, HEW promulgated a regulation on\nNovember 27, 196'+, which became effective after\nthe President's approval on December 3, 1964 [A0\nVol 0TI, p, 254] 0 The regulation is designed \"to\neffectuate the provisions of Title VI of the Civil\nc?fights Act of 1964 000 ,\" (LE5 C Q FpP..

Vo10II,\np.248] 0 In language paralleling section 601 of the\nAct,the regulation generally forbids discrimination\nin any covered program and it enumerates \"specific\ndiscriminatory actions\" which any \"recipient\"  of\nfederal fin2ncial assistance is prohibited. to\nengage in.

Enforcement Proceedings Against the Alabama\nDepartment\nA. Efforts to obtain voluntary compliance\nShortly after enactment of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964 the Commissioner of Welfare transmitted a copy\nof the Act to each state welfare agency (A. Vol. II,\np.220). In October 1964 HEW sponsored a meeting of all\nstate welfare administrators for the purpose of discussing\nimplementation of Title VI and details of the proposed\ndepartmental regulation which were then being formulated\nVol. II, \n(A.  p. 220]. Representatives of the Alabama\nDepartment of Pensions and Security attended the meeting\n[A. Vol. II, p. 220]. After adoption of the regulation\non December 3, 1964, copies were sent to each state welfare\nagency [A. Vol. II, pp. 194,220). In late December 1964\nand early January 1965 information concerning relevant\nportions of the HEW regulation were sent to the state\nwelfare agencies, and on January 19, 1965 HEW sent to all\nstate agencies administering approved public assistance\nplans a handbook which outlined the state agency's\nresponsibilities, explained the assurance requirement, and\n- 8 -\n\ncontained a suggested sample assurance form. Form\nCB-FS-5022, which is reproduced at pp. 42-47 of the\nRecord and again in our Appendix, Vol. I, p. 158 A-C\n[A. Vol. II, p. 220]. By August 1965, every state except\nAlabama had filed an assurance accepted by HEW as adequate\nunder (cid:129)80.4(b) [R. 17; A. Vol. II, pp. 275, 196].\nEfforts to negotiate with the Alabama Department\nand bring that agency into voluntary compliance with\nTitle VI and the regulation were extensive. The corres-\npondence between representatives of HEW and the Alabama\nDepartment is set out in our Appendix, Vol. I, pp. 161-179.\nThis correspondence illustrates the divergence of views on\nissues between the Alabama Department and HEW, which are\nissues essentially those raised in this proceeding with\nrespect to the validity of the regulation.\nBriefly, the record reflects the following:\nOn March 1, 1965, Mr. Rubin King, Commissioner of\nthe Alabama Department, wrote HEW officials stating in\neffect that his Department did not and would not deny\naid, care, or service to any individual on the grounds of\nrace, color, or national origin; but he took the position\n- 9 -\n\nthat the statement of compliance required by the Commissioner\nof 'Jelfare was unreasonable and that he was instructed not\nto sign it [A, Vol. I, p. 161]. In response, HEM officials(cid:9) i\nsought to determine if the difficulty was with the wording\nof the statement as distinguished from its substance and\nrequested that the Alabama Department let them know what\nthe difficulty was [A. Vol, I, pp, 16?-163], Commissioner\nKing, on March 12, 1965, responded by quoting his prior\nletter and indicated that it would be inappropriate to\ncomment further [A, Vol, I, p o 164],\nOn March 19, 1965, the Commissioner of Welfare,\nDr, Ellen Winston, wrote Commissioner King, explaining\nto him that the requirement of the regulation was important,\nthat compliance with it was called for now, and that failure\nto comply with it could result in the discontinuance of grants\nunder the federal welfare program, Commissioner Winston\nsuggested a meeting between the officials of the two\nagencies(cid:9) [A, Vol, 1,(cid:9) p.(cid:9) 165-166]. On ?-larch 23,(cid:9) 1965,\nCommissioner King responded to that letter, suggested\nthat April 21 rather than March 25, as suggested by\nCommissioner Winston, would be an appropriate date for\na\n- 10 -\n\nthe meeting [A. Vol. I, p. 167]. On April 2, 1965,\nCommissioner Winston responded to Commissioner King,\nregretting the delay in the proposed meeting but made\narrangements for a meeting with him on April 21, 1965\n[A. Vol. I, p. 168]. After this meeting occurred,\nCommissioner Winston wrote Commissioner King confirming\nher understanding that the Alabama Department would let\nher know within two weeks whether it planned to submit\na statement of compliance as required by the regulation\n[A. Vol. I, p. 169]. On May 7, 1965, Commissioner King\nwired Commissioner Winston as follows:\nSTATE BOARD OF PENSIONS AND SECURITY IN\nSESSION TODAY, AUTHORIZING A SUIT TO CONTEST\nVALIDITY OF REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY HEALTH,\nEDUCATION AND WELFARE UNDER TITLE VI OF THE\nCIVIL RIGHTS ACT. [A. Vol. I, p. 170].\nOn August 17, 1965, Commissioner Winston initiated\nadministrative proceedings by notifying the Alabama\nDepartment of its noncompliance and offering it an oppor-\ntunity for an administrative hearing [R. 17; A. Vol. II,\npp. 275, 2231.\nThree days later, on August 20, 1965, Commissioner\nKing wrote Commissioner Winston setting out a statement of\n- 11 -\n\nhis Department's \"compliance with Title VI of the\nFederal Civil Rights Act of 1964\" [A. Vol. I, pp. 171-173].\nThe letter claimed that \"the Department of Pensions and(cid:9)\n4\nSecurity is in full conformity with the Federal Civil\nRights Act in determining who can get aid and how much\nthey are entitled to get,\" and also that, \"other services\nare given according to the need for the service and available\nresources and not on the basis of race, color, or national\norigin.\" The letter continued:\nIn a number of counties office space is\nfurnished by local governing bodies with\nno Federal or state participation. This\nagency has no authority to control the use\nof the physical arrangements in these build-\nings. It would be impossible to enforce\ndiscontinuance of separate facilities in\nthese departments and also impossible to\nmake other housing arrangements in many\nof these counties.\nTurning to discrimination by \"vendors\" or \"third parties,\"\nthe letter said:\nThe Alabama Department of Pensions and\nSecurity is told that segregation exists\nin some institutions, agencies, and organiza-\ntions within the state from whom aid, care,\nservices and other benefits are received on\nbehalf of applicants or recipients of the\ndepartment through contractual or other\narrangements.\n- 12 -\n\nWhile many of the hospitals are complying\nwith the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and\nothers are taking definite steps toward\nintegration of their facilities, this\nagency has no authority to control such\nhospitals and cannot enforce compliance.\nThis agency has no authority to control\nnursing homes and would have no authority\nto see that compliance was effected.\nWith respect to children's institutions, Commissioner King's\nletter contended that voluntary child-care institutions\nand agencies are not operated by the Department of Pensions\nand Security but by other boards which have full responsi-\nbility over their admission policies; that a number of\nchildren in them are under juvenile court jurisdiction with\nthe Department having only supervisory responsibility;\nand that \"any change in plans would be at the discretion\nof the courts and not the department.\" It further stated\nthat all licensed day care centers were under private\nauspices and that Alabama \"has no authority to enforce\n1/\ncompliance on the part of these centers.\" With respect to\nservices rendered by physicians, the letter stated:\nV Commissioner King's letter also said that although his\nDepartment \"participates as probation officers in planning for\nadmission\" to training schools, \"the courts and schools make\nthe final decision.\"\n- 13 -\n\nThe State Department of Pensions and Security\nis of the opinion that it is not within its\nprovince nor its duty to attempt to require\nphysicians to comply with the Civil Rights\nAct nor does it think that needy people who\nare in need of a physician's service should\nbe denied the right of freedom of choice in\nthis matter. Unavailability of physicians'\nservices in some areas would result in lack\nof equity of treatment to individuals in those\nareas and violate the principle of statewideness.\nThe letter concluded by saying that \"The Alabama Department\nof Pensions and Security does not deny aid, care, or\nservices to any individual on the ground of race, color,\n4/\nor national origin.\"\nThe Commissioner responded to the Alabama Depart-\nment's letter through Assistant General Counsel Yourman\non August 27, 1965. Mr. Yourman's letter stated that the\nstatement of compliance \"falls far short of what has been\nrequired from and provided by every other state agency\nadministering the public assistance and child welfare\nservice programs\" [A. Vol. I, pp. 174-176]. He then\nexplained in detail the reasons why, in HEW's opinion, the\nQ\nAugust 20th letter from the Alabama Department could not be\naccepted as an adequate statement of compliance. Briefly, (cid:9)\nti\nThe letter also dealt with dissemination of information\nabout Title VI and the Regulations and complaint procedures.\n- 14 -\n\nthe objections were, among others, that while the Alabama\nDepartment's statement of compliance indicated that some\nof the institutions, agencies, and organizations discriminate\non the basis of race in providing services, the statement\ndid not indicate what methods the Alabama Department would\nimplement to correct this situation, Nor had the agency\ntaken action to determine the extent of noncompliance in\nthird-party arrangements, even though it indicated there\nwas some racial discrimination practiced by these third\nparties,\nEfforts to achieve voluntary compliance continued\nafter the administrative process began, but to no avail;\n[A, Vol, II, p, 221] and on September 29, 1965, Commissioner\nKing again wired Commissioner Winston, That the telegram\nstated:\nl\nSTATE BOARD OF PENSIONS AND SECURITY, IN\nSESSION TODAY, REAFFIRMED AUTHORIZATION\nFOR TESTING VALIDITY OF RULES AND REGULA-\nTIONS PROMULGATED BY DEPARTMENT OF HEW\nUNDER TITLE VI OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT\n[A. Vol. I, p o 179]0\nB. The Administrative Proceeding\nOn August 17, 1965, the Commissioner of Welfare formally\nadvised Alabama of her \"Determination of Inability to Secure\nCompliance by Voluntary Means\" (R, 17; A. Vol. II, pp. 13,275, 223,\n187], On the same day, acting under section 602 of the Act\nand sections 80.8(c) and 80.9 of the regulations, she offered\n- 15 -\n\nthe Alabama Department an opportunity for a hearing to\nc\ndetermine formally whether it was in compliance with the\nregulation [A. Vol, II, p. 2?41,\nAfter the administrative pleadings were in, an\nevidentia.ry hearing was held i.n Washington, D o C. on\nOctober. 21, 1965, before a Civil Service Hearing Examiner\n[A. Vol. II, pp. 17, 225]. Commissioner King's testimony\nverified the statements contained in his letter of\nAugust 20 about the discriminatory practices of vendors\nand other third parties and the Alabama . Department's\nrefusal to concern itself with that matter, Thus, he\ntestified that most physicians' offices in Alabama are\nsegregated by race; that most doctors, in his opinion, will\nnot desegregate their waiting rooms; that many child-care\ninstitutions, hospitals, and nursing homes are segregated;\nand that he believed the Alabama Department had no responsi-\nbility to determine which physicians' offices were segregated,\nand had not undertaken such a survey [A, Vol, I, pp. 98-99,\n101-103, 110-113]. He testified that:\nI will tell you, Mr. Yoiirman, we\nnever intended to sign a compliance\nstatement ... whereby we had to take\nin consideration contractual arrange-\nments with third parties [A. Vol, I, p, 128],\n- 16 -\nIIL(cid:9) -(cid:9) r.rr^.^.w(cid:9) ^ —:(cid:9) .(cid:9) ^1^-1(cid:9) Y(cid:9) YY(cid:9) We^IY^rYW^^\n\nHe also testified that he would be opposed to assigning\nNegro welfare caseworkers to white cases, thus indicating\nthat segregation is practiced even in programs under the\ndirect control of the Alabama Department [A.. Vol. I,\np. 1331 .\nOn April 5, 1965, the hearing examiner issued a\ndecision, finding(cid:9) inter alia, that the statement of\ncompliance submitted by the Alabama Department by letter\ndated August 20 \"is not adequate to meet the requirements\nof section 80.4(b)\" of the regulation . The examiner\nrecommended termination of federal financial assistance to\nthe State of Alabama under Titles I, IV, V (part 3), X\nI/\nand XIV of the Social Security Act.\nThe examiner also found that there was actual racial\ndiscrimination in the operation of various aspects of the\nwelfare programs in Alabama [A. Vol. II, pp. 229-231, 241-2421.\nThese findings were based on the testimony of and corres-\npondence with Commissioner King.\n- 17-\n\n((cid:9) The fec.i.sion of the (;or.?mi-ssioner\nof '7elf re, \\s required by the reculation (80010(a))\nthe hearii examiner's recommended decision was\ncertified to tree Commission of Welfare for a final\ndecision, She heard oral argument on June 16, 1966,\nanal on Novamher 16, 1966 she rendered a final\ndecision, rejecting the objections made by the\nAlabama )-^p?rtment to the examiner's recommended\ndecision and adopting that decision with minor modi-\nfications not pertinent to this proceeding [A0 Vol,\nTI, pp, 26269]\nDD0a The Decision of the secretary\nPursuant to the regulation, the Commissioner's\nfinal decision was transmitted to the Secretary of\n}-t a.1th, Education, and 'Jelfare, whose duty under the\nregulation is to \"approve such decision\", \"vacate it\",\nor \"remit or. mitigate\" the termination sanction im-\nposed by the Commissioner of 'Telfare (45 C,Fn^..\n78O010(e)),- 0n January 12, 1967, the .Secretary\napproved the Commissioner's decision and ordered\ntermination of funds to Alabama effective midnight\nFebruary 28, 1967(cid:9) [\"'.0 16-41; A.

It has not made a clear and adequate\ncommitment to insure. nondiscriminatory\noperation of its Federally aided welfare\nprograms even in those parts which involve\npayments or the provision of services\ndirectly to beneficiaries by the [Alabama]\nagency. As stated by the General Counsel\nat page 4 of his brief dated December 22,\n1965, \"This prohibition against discrimina-\ntion extends to any differential treatment\non account of race in any aspect of the mak-\ning of money payments, including the treatment\nof individuals in facilities where application\nis made, any medical. examinations incident to\nthe determination of eligibility, the deter-\nmination of eligibility itself and the amount\nor type of benefits or social services, and\nthe assignment of case workers.\" The pro-\nhibition against discrimination similarly\nextends to other matters which are under\nthe Agency's control such as the location\nof local offices.\n2. The Alabama agency has refused to accept\nany responsibility for assuring that third\nparties to whom it provides services, or whom\nit compensates in connection with care they\nprovide to beneficiaries, shall provide such\ncare without racial discrimination.\n3. It has not provided an adequate statement\nof the extent to which racial discrimination\npresently exists in connection with its\nFederally-assisted welfare programs.\n- 20 -\n\n4. It has not agreed to or proposed methods\nof administering its Federally-assisted wel-\nfare programs--even in connection with those\nmatters which do not involve the services of\nthird parties--in a way that gives reasonable\nassurance that those parts of its programs will\nbe operated on a non-discriminatory basis. More\nspecifically, it has not:\n(a) provided sufficiently for\ninstruction or dissemination of\ninformation about the rights and\nresponsibilities under Title VI\nof staff members, beneficiaries\nor third parties providing\nservices;\n(b) proposed any system of\nsurveying compliance, keeping\nrecords or filing reports that\nwould enable compliance to be\nproperly evaluated;\n(c) suggested a complaint\nprocess that offers all interested\nor affected persons an adequate\nopportunity for consideration of\ncomplaints of alleged ncn-compliance.\nIn short, more than two years after promulgation\nof this Department's Title VI Regulation and more\nthan 16 months after receipt of the bill of par-\nticulars contained in the General Counsel's\nletter of August 27, 1965, the Alabama agency\nhas not offered to correct any of the deficiencies\nin compliance as to any part of any of its\nFederally-assisted programs (R. 23-24; A. Vol. II,\npp. 285-287]\n- 21 -\n\nThe Secretary went on to consider in detail,\nand reject, a series of objections and arguments made\nby the Alabama Department [R. 25-39; A, Vol. II, pp. 288-312].\nAddressing himself to the State's objection to filing\nan assurance about services rendered by vendors and other\nthird parties, the Secretary said [R. 30; A. Vol. II,\np. 297-298] :\nM\n22 -\n- \n\n1-?o^.'ever it i s rhrasec1, the Alabama\nagency is saying that In complying with\nTitle VI it should not have any responsi-\nbility to avoid arr^ngerlents  -'ith third\nZ \nParties who discriminate.\nNo one ha.s sucgested that it can com-\npel private parties to provide services\nto Federally-assisted beneficiaries ,i th-\nout  i scrjt\"ination,\nc? \nOur\" P.eg\"l ation under Title VI is based\nupon the premise that most of those ;pro-\nvidin i '>>lch services can be persuaded to\nprovide them nondiscrimi.na tori_1 v and. to\nthe extent they will not, that Federal\nfunds should not be paid to help perpetuate\nsuch discriminatory practices against\ninnocent beneficia_ries o Alternate,\nacceptable services shoul d he found and\ndeveloped.\nThe Alabama agency has refused to\nbe a party to such per. sunsi_on and admi ni s-\ntrati_ve action, at least until it has\nexhausted its rights to judi.ci'l review.\nAssuming the legality of our 'egulation\nwere upheld, the Agency apparently would\nthen accept responsibility for seeking\nthird party compliance--although, of\ncourse, it will have no greater power\nthan to compel such compliance than it\nnow hhns\n- 23 -\n\nI\nIV. The District :ourt Proceedings\nThe State's complaint, on behalf of the Alabama\nDepartment, filed on January 13, 1967 and amended the\nfirst time on January 16, purported to invoke the\ndistrict courts jurisdiction under section 10 of the\nAdministration Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 1009, and\n28 U.S.C. 1331, and alleged an amount in controversy\nin excess of $10,000 [R.6,7,48]. The complaint chal-\nlenged the validity of the Secretary's order and the\nunderlying regulation requiring the submission of the\nassurance as a condition of continuing to receive fed-\neral financial assistance.\nOn January 26, 1967, the Secretary filed a\nmotion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for a change\nof venue [R.65]. The motion asserted that the\nDistrict Court lacked jurisdiction because jurisdic-\ntion to review the action of the Secretary \"is in\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Fitth\nCircuit\", and sought, in the alternative, an order\ntransferring the case to another jurisdiction\nbecause the District Court f^,r the Northern District\nof Alabama did not have venue under 28 U.SOC. 1391\n[R.65-66].\n- 24 -\n\nOn February 1, 1907, the :ecret.ary i i\n,ins, 'er, and on the same date A1pbarr snt?ght to -C l.e\na second amended. rnrrp1iint [r 0 7n- 7?,73-7E1 0 \"'he\nansw,,er denied that the district court had jurisdic-\ntion of the subject matter, denied that failure to\nexecute the assurance ;.n the form c ont?i.ncc' in the\nhealth, Education, :sic?

The four individuals alleged that\nthey would be irreparably injured themselves if the\nSecretary's order was carried out [R. 71].\nA hearing was held before the district court on\nFebruary 1. At the hearing, counsel for the Secretary\nreserved the right to object to the second amended\ncomplaint which had been served upon him only shortly\nbefore [R. 91, 92, 96]. Exhibits were introduced in\nevidnece by both sides, including the entire administra-\ntive record. The remainder of the hearing was devoted\nprimarily to argument. At the close of the argument,\nthe district court ruled that \"in the event the cutoff\nof funds ... does become effective, irreparable harm and\ninjury will be done,\" and that because \"in all probability\"\nthe matter will \"ultimately have to be resolved in the\nCourt of Appeals and would be considered by that\nCourt as an emergency matter and reached as quickly\nas possible,\" it would grant plaintiff's motion for\na preliminary injunction [R. 111-112]. The order\ngranting the preliminary injunction was formally\nentered on February 3, 1967 [R. 87]. On that same\n- 26 -\n\ndate, the district court filed its findings of fact and\nconclusions of law [R. 77-85]. It also permitted the\nfiling of the second amended complaint [R. 79]. The\ndistrict court noted that while it was \"not passing\nupon\" the merits but only ruling on a request for\npreliminary relief, it viewed the questions as to the\nvalidity of the regulations and other federal requirements\nas \"substantial.\"\nThe Secretary filed a notice of appeal on\nFebruary 10, 1967, and on February 13, 1967, he\nfiled a motion for an expedited hearing by this\nCourt and for leave to proceed on the original record.\nThis Court denied the request to proceed on the original\nrecord, but granted the motion for expedited considera-\ntion with the reservation that the argument should not\nbe scheduled for a date earlier than April 30, 1967.\nOn February 18, 1967, Alabama filed in this\nCourt a petition for direct review of the Secretary's\norder, invoking jurisdiction under 42 US C 1316\nand section 603 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nwith respect to four of the five welfare programs\n- 27 -\n\ninvolved in this case (excluding Title V, part 3\ns\n(child welfare services)). Alabama's petition\nfor review contended that jurisdiction to review\nthe Secretary's order with respect to all five\nprograms was properly in the district court, but\nthat, \"in the alternative, ...if under the statutes\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth\nCircuit has sole jurisdiction over the four wel-\nfare programs...\" (other than Title V, part 3)\n\"A..such a review is hereby sought and prayed\nfor as to each and all of such four programs\" on\nthe same grounds as were alleged in the district\ncourt proceeding,\nOn March 14, 1.967, this Court granted\nappellee's motion to consolidate the appeal and\nthe petition for review.\n- 28 -\n\nSPECIFICATIONS OF ERROR\nThe District Court abused its discre-\nti n in issuing a preliminary injunction,\nbecause:\n1. It has no jurisdiction to\nreview the Secretary's order,\nand\n2 0 The HEW regulation upon\nwhich the Secretary's order\nwas based is clearly valid,\n- 29 -\n\nARGU 1ENT\nI o 11he Jurisdictional Issues\nA consolidation of this appeal from the District\nCourt's order granting a preliminary injunction with\nAlabama's alternative petition for review of the Secre-\ntary's order, permits this Court -- either on the appeal\nor on the petition for review -- to reach the substantive\nissue of this case -- the validity of the ?HEW regulation\nrequiring the submission of an assurance. This is true\nregardless of who prevails on this appeal on the juris-\ndictional question whether the Court of Appeals had\nexclusive jurisdiction t:o review the Secretary's order.\nIf the Secretary prevails on his claim with respect to\nany of the five programs that jurisdiction to review\nthe termination order is vested exclusively in this\nCourt, then the substantive question could and should\nbe decided on the petition for review, and that deter-\nmination would be binding on the District Court in\nreviewing whatever aspect of the order, if any, is\nwithin its jurisdiction to review. In the event\nthat the Secretary does not prevail on the juris-\ndictional issue with respect to any of the five programs,\nthen the substantive issue can be decided on the\nappeal from the preliminary injunction. The granting\nof a preliminary injunction must be conditioned\non the District Court making a determination that\nthe movan.t has a significant likelihood of suc-\nceeding on the merits, and this Court could decide\n- 30 -\n\nthe substantive issues by deciding that there is no likeli-\nhood of the Alabama Department succeeding in its claim that\nthe HEW regulation is invalid. See, e.g ., Wooten V. Ohler,\n303 F.2d 759 (C.A. 5, 1962); Johnson v. Kirkland, 290 F.2d\n440 (C.A. 5, 1961), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 889 (1961);\nFlight Engineers' Inter. Assn. v.

Brown, 331 F.2d 362 (C.A. 10,\n1964).\nAlthough we believe the substantive issue underlying\nthis legal controversy can be resolved regardless of how the\njurisdictional question is resolved, the jurisdictional issue\nmust still be reached by this Court; it is the threshold\nissue which determines whether the substantive issue is to\nbe resolved on the appeal or the alternative petition for\nreview. Moreover, this Court can reach the jurisdictional\nissue on this appeal from the order of the District Court\ngranting the motion for a preliminary injunction.\nThe very issuance of the, preliminary injunction put the\njurisdictional issue before this Court, because, under\nestablished doctrine, as a matter of law it would be an\nabuse of discretion for a district court to issue a pre-\nliminary injunction for the duration of the pendency of\nthe review proceedings, as the District Court did in\nthis case, when it had no jurisdiction to review the under-\nlying administrative order.

The District Court dismissed the complaint,\nand its ruling was affirmed. The Court of Appeals said\nCongress had \"provided that any party aggrieved may have\nits rights reviewed here\" and, viewing this as \"the\nexclusive remedy,\" held that the District Court lacked\njurisdiction over the controversy.\nSi li.lar]_ y, in Whitney Bank v. New Orleans Bank,\n379 U.S. 411 (1965), the pertinent statute gave the Fed-\neral Reserve Board power to decide whether a new branch\nbank should be established and it also provided that\n12 / Sec. 402(b), Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C.\n(cid:129)402(b):\n\"(b) An appeal may be taken, in the manner\nhereinafter provided, from decisions of the\nCommission to the United States Court of\nAppeals for the District of Columbia in any of\nthe following cases:\n\"(1) By any applicant for a construction per-\nmit for a radio station, or for a radio station\nlicense, or for renewal of an existing radio\nstation license, or for modification of an exist-\ning radio station license, whose application is\nrefused by the Commission.\n\"(2) By any other person aggrieved or whose\ninterests are adversely affected by any decision\nof the Commission granting or refusing any such\napplication.\"\n- 36 -\n\nreview of the Board's decision \"may\" be had in the court\nof appeals where the bank was to be established. A suit\nwas brought in the District Court against the Comptroller\nof the Currency to enjoin establishment of a branch bank,\nand an injunction issued. The Supreme Court reversed and\nheld that the matter must go first to the Board and  \"is\nsubject to review only in the courts of appeals, not ..o\nin the district courts.\" With reference both to the\nadministrative scheme and the judicial review statute,\nthe Supreme Court reasoned that where Congress \"has enacted\na specific statutory scheme for obtaining review ... the\nstatutory mode of review must be adhered to notwithstanding\nthe absence of an express statutory command of exclusive-\nness.\" 379 U.S., at 422-423.\nThus, if assistance were terminated under these titles\nfor reasons unrelated to noncompliance with Title VI, review\nwould be had exclusively in the courts of appeals. The legis-\nlative history of section 603 of Title VI indicates that\nCongress wished to preserve that reviewing structure. Section\n603 was not intended to disturb the settled principles re-\ngarding the proper forum for judicial review. Senator Pastore,\na floor manager for Title VI, stated in this regard:\nAdditional safeguards against arbitrary ac-\ntion are provided in section 603. Under that\nsection 602 would be subject to judicial\nreview to the extent and in the manner pro-\nvided by existing law applicable to similar\naction taken by the agency on other grounds.\n- 37 -\n\nThus, where special statutory review proce-\ndures are available under certain statutes,\nthese procedures should be followed.\nFor example, Public Law 815 and the Hill\nBurton Act -- 20 United States Code 641(b), \n42 United States Code 291(j) -- provide for\nspecial review procedures for denial of a\ngrant and for withholding funds thereunder.\nThe same procedures would be followed under\nTitle VI. 110 Co(cid:9) Rec., 88th Cong., 2nd\nSess. , p. 7063,\nSee also, remarks of Chairman Celler, 110 Cong. Rec. ,\npart 2, 88th Cong., 2nd Sess., p. 1586.\nIn summary, the language of section 603, its\nlegislative history, and the case law make clear that\nthis Court -- not the district court -- is the exclusive\nforum for judicial review of Secretary Gardner's order\ninsofar as it terminates assistance under Titles I, IV,\nX, XIV of the Social Security Act.\nB.(cid:9) Title V (part 3) of the Social Security Act\nTitle V (part 3) relates to child welfare services,\nand involves about one million of the $100 million in fed-\neral funds which were terminated by the Secretary's order.\nThe Social Security Act is silent as to the proper forum\nfor review of administrative action respecting that Title,\nand that silence is the basis of the Alabama Department's\nclaim that it has the option to seek review of all five\n13/ Both of statutes mentioned by Senator Pastore provide\nfor review in the Court of Appeals.\n- 38 -\n\ntitles i.n the district ro,irt. The .irgunmetit is that the\nsilence of the ,social Security Act 1ne.ans, that under X603\nof Title VI and section LO of the Administrative Procedure\nAct, review of the Secretary's order with respect to that\ntitle must be in the district court, and that since that\ntitle must be reviewed in the district Court, the remaining\ntitles nav he reviewed there because compelling them to\n-3roceed in two courts renders \"inadequate\" review of the\nother four titles by this Court. The thrust of their\nargunent is too give the State the option of choosing\neither the district court or the Court of Appeals for the\nforum to initiate review proceedings respecting the four\ntitles other than Title V (part 3),and that with respect to\nthat Title the exclusive foru\"n for initiating review is the\ndistrict court.\nWe believe that this argument errs in two respects.\nFirst, Title V (part 3) is, in our view, also reviewable in\nthe court of appeals, and second, even if it were not, that\nwould not divest this Court of exclusive jurisdiction to\nreview the order as it affects the other four titles.\nFairly construed, section 603, providing for judicial\nreview \"as may otherwise be provided by law for similar\naction taken by such department or agency on other grounds,\"\nand section 1316 of Title 42, together vest in this Court by\nimplication the authority to review the order with respect\n- 39 -\n\nto Title V (part 3). This conclusion follows from a\nconsideration of the nature of the several welfare pro-\ngraces, the congressional p7licy favoring quick and final\nreview of federal administrative action taken against\nstate agencies, and sensible judicial administration.\nThe rationale of the judicial review provision of the\nSocial Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1316, is that federal\nadministrative action taken against a state agency affect-\nin,, state-wide operations should he subject to speedy and\n14/\nfinal judicial review.(cid:9) Hence, whenever the Social Security\nAct provides for judicial review of a state-wide program,\nthe review is in the courts of appeals. Title V (part 3 )\nlike \nTitles I, IV, X and XIV, is concerned with a state-wide\nwelfare program and requires the state agency to submit a\nstate plan as a condition to eligibility for federal funds.\nThus, the principle of section 1316 that administrative\norders affecting states and state-wide programs are to be\nreviewed in courts of appeals is equally applicable to\nTitle V (part 3) and sections 603 and 1316 should be con-\nstrued to vest such jurisdiction here, absent some indication\nof a contrary congressional intention.\n14/ See 89th Cong., 1st Sess., Sen. Rep. 404, Finance\n('nmmi ttoo nn 1 S(1-1 S1 (cid:127)  R9th Cong., 1st Sess., House Rep.\ntee, p. 131.\n\nThe only suggestion of a congressional intent in\nthe Social Security Act that review should be in district\ncourts is where benefits are cut off under Title II of the\nAct, dealing with federal old-age survivors and disability\npayments. There, judicial review is to be in district courts\nand the statute so provides. 42 U.S.C. 405(g) The under-\nlying reasons why review is lodged in the district courts\nunder Title II is that private individuals would be the\ncomplainants in Title II proceedings, and the typical\nprivate plaintiff is a person of modest means who might\nfind it burdensome to litigate initially in the court of\nappeals. See Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administration\nAction, p. 158 (1963). Of course, that reasoning is wholly\ninapplicable to Title V (part 3) since the state is easily\nable to litigate directly in the court of appeals and,\nindeed, may do so with respect to Title V (part 3) with no\nfurther burden, if any, than it must assume in any event\nunder Titles I, IV, X, and XIV.\nAnother reason why Title V (part 3) ought to be\nreviewed here is that it is almost inseparably related to\nthe child welfare services provided to needy families under\nTitle IV -- and exclusive jurisdiction of Title IV is in\nthis Court. One requirement of a child welfare plan under\nTitle V (part 3) is to have adequate coordination with the\nchild welfare programs under Title IV, 42 U.S.C. 723. In\nfact, one of the functions of Title V plans is to reduce\nthe burden of providing child welfare services under Title\n- 41 -\n\nIV. Senate Report No. 1189 (87th Cong., 2d Seas.), 1962\nU. S. Code, Cong, and Adm, News, pp. 1943, 1949, 1957.\nSince the statute expressly vests review of Title IV in\nthis Court and economical judicial administration suggests\nthat the two programs should be reviewed together, this(cid:9) r\nCourt should review them both. Such a result is consistent\nwith congressional purposes. Where it is clear in which\ncourt Congress intended one of the titles to be reviewed,\nbut doubtful where Congress intended the other to be reviewed,\nreview should be in the court which plainly is supposed to hear\nat least one title -- not in the court whose jurisdiction to\nhear one title is doubtful and which is plainly not the\ncourt Congress wanted to hear the other.\nTo be sure, had Congress expressly declared that Title V\n(part 3) was to be reviewed in district courts and the other\ntitles in the courts of appeals, we would concede that review\nwould have to proceed in two courts, See Fletcker` V. Atomic\nEnergy Commission, supra. But that is not this case.\nCongress has not declared where Title V (part 3) shall be\nreviewed, and hence it is open to this Court to decide that\nquestion consistent with sound principles of judicial adminis-\ntration and the overall scheme of judicial review set forth in\nQ\n42 U.S.C. 1316 and section 603 of Title VI.\nHowever, even assuming that jurisdiction of Title V\n(part 3) is properly had in the district court, such juris-\n-42-\n\ndiction would not justify the district court taking jurisdiction\nover any of the other titles. Such a result would be totally\ninconsistent with any kind of could judicial administration, cf.\nAlmour v, Pace, supra at 702 and DiBenedette v. Morgenthau,\n148 F. 2d 223 (C.A. D.C. 1945), petition dismissed on motion of\npetitioners, 326 U.S. 686 (1945), and is totally inconsistent\nwith the purpose and intent of the Social Security Act in pro-\nviding for judicial review in the Court of Appeals for state-wide\n15/\nwelfare plans. It would have the $1 million tail wagging the\n$100 million dog.\nNor would the district court be vested with jurisdiction\nover the four titles, as well as Title V (part 3) on the theory\nthat review of the four titles other than Title V (part 3) here\nwould be \"inadequate\" because if this Court reviews the four\ntitles Alabama will be forced to litigate in two courts, Since\nthe same legal issues are involved under all five titles, and no\nfactual questions are -- or can be -- raised in this review pro-\nceeding, whatever this Court decides as to the validity of the\nSecretary's order as it relates to Titles I, IV,X and XIV will\ndispose of the validity of the very same order as it relates to\nTitle V (part 3) as well. The District Court will be bound by\n15 /As has been noted on many occasions:\nSection 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act\ndoes not establish jurisdiction in a federal\ncourt over an act not otherwise cognitive by it.\nSection 10(b) does not render competent a court\nwhich lacks jurisdiction on other grounds.\n- 43 -\n\nwhatever this Court ultimately decides about the validity of\nthe Secretary's order or the underlying regulation as it relates\nto the other four titles.\nWe therefore believe that this Court is the exclusive\nforum for review of the Secretary's action, and that the order\ngranting the motion for preliminary injunction be vacated and\nreversed, and the complaint filed below dismissed. This Court\nwould then proceed to decide the substantial issues as to the\nvalidity of the Secretary's order and the underlying regulation\non Alabama's alternative petition for review.\n15/(Cont 0 from preceding page)\nKansas City Power (cid:9) Light v.

United\nStates,(cid:9) 1145, 149 (COAO D.C.1951); Almour v\nPie, supra.\n- 44 -\n\nII. The Validity of the HEW Regulation.\nThe central issue in this case is whether HEW,\nin excercising the rule-making power granted to it under\n(cid:129)602, can lawfully require the Alabama Department to submit\nan assurance which identifies the areas where racial dis-\ncrimination is practiced in its programs and in the\nfacilities used in these programs, which commits it to use\nits best efforts to eliminate that racial discrimination,\nand which describes how it proposes to go about that task.\nThe validity of the HEW regulation has been challenged\nprimarily because it requires the Alabama Department to\nassume responsibility for the elimination of racial dis-\ncrimination in the facilities and services provided by\nthird parties in connection with the state welfare program,\nbut also because it requires the Alabama Department to\nassume full responsibility for eliminating racial dis-\ncrimination in the parts of its programs that involve\npayments or the provision of services directly to beneficiaries.\nWe submit that the HEW regulation is not only one\namong many reasonable means of implementing Title VI, but\nthat also it is perhaps the most appropriate regulation\n- 45 -\n\nthat could be promulgated by the agency to carry out\nthe congressional mandate. It must be recognized, however,\nthat the reviewing court need not concur in that judgment.\nThe reviewing court must, according to traditional ad-\nministrative law doctrine, defer to the judgment of the(cid:9) 1'\nadministrative agency on the widsom of the regulation since\nthis regulation is an exercise of the rule-making power\nconferred on the agency by Congress, and because the agency\nhas complied with the procedural requirement for the\nexercise of that rule-making power.(cid:9) As Professor Davis\nputs it, \"the reviewing court has no authority to substitute\n[its] judgment as to the content of the rule, for the\nlegislative body has placed the power in the agency and\nnot in the court.\" 1 Davis, Administrative Law, p. 299\n(1958). This observation was based on such cases as\nAmerican Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. United States, 299\nU S 232, 236-37 (1936) where Mr. Justice Cardozo said for\na unanimous court:\n1f/ The procedural requirement contained in (cid:129)602 is that the\nPresident must approve the regulation, and this regulation has\nbeen so approved. Because the regulation relates to \"loans,\ngrants, benefits, or contracts\" within the meaning of (cid:129)4 of\nthe Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. (cid:129)553(a)(2), the\nhearing and notice requirements of that section respecting the\npromulgation of rules or regulations are inapplicable.\n- 46 -\n\nThis court is not at liberty to substitute\nits own discretion for that of administra-\ntive officers who have kept within the\nbounds of their administrative powers. To\nshow that these have been exceeded in the\nfield of action here involved, it is not\nenough that the prescribed system of ac-\ncounts shall appear to be unwise or\nburdensome or inferior to another. Error\nor unwisdom is not equivalent to abuse.\nWhat has been ordered must appear ...\nto be the expression of a whim rather than\nan exercise of judgment. 1I/\n1/ See also e.g., National Broadcasting Co., Inc. v.\nUnited States, 319 U.S. 190, 224 (1943); Securities &\nExchange Commission v. Cherney Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 207,\n209 (1947); Boske v. Comingore, 177 U.S. 459, 470 (1900),\nwhere the Court upheld a procedural regulation of an\nagency stating that \"[i]n determining whether the regula-\ntions ... are consistent with\" the Act, \"we must apply the\nrule of decision which controls when an act of Congress is\nassailed as not being within the powers conferred upon it\nby the Constitution; that is to say, a regulation ... should\nnot be disregarded or annulled unless ... it is plainly and\npalpably inconsistent with the law.\" Phelps Dodge Corp. v.\nNational Labor Relations Board, 313 U.S. 177, 194 (1941);\nFederal Communications Commission v. WJR, The Goodwill\nStation, Inc., 337 U.S 265, 282 (1949); Federal Communica-\ntions Commission v. Pottsville Broadcasting Compan y, 309\nU.S. 134, 143 (1940). And in enacting (cid:129)602 of Title VI\nCongress intended to vest that kind of broad discretion in\nthe various federal agencies. Thus, Senator Pastore said\n(110 Cong.. Rec. 7058 (1964)):\n\"Action is mandatory, but the procedure by which\nthat action is accomplished is discretionary, subject,\nhowever, to the approval of the President.\"\n- 47 -\n\nThis deference to the judgment of the administrative\nagency is particularly appropriate in an instance such as\nthis where the regulation in issue is a \"contemporaneous\nconstruction of a [new] statute by the men charged with the\nresponsibility of setting its machinery in motion, of making\nthe parts work efficiently and smoothly while they are yet\nuntried and new.\" United States v. American Trucking\nAssociation, Inc., 310 U.S. 534, 549 (1940), quoting\nNorwegian Nitrogen Co. v. United States, 288 U.S. 294,\n315 (1933). This is not to ignore or belittle the role\nof the reviewing court as the safeguard against arbitrary\nadministrative action. The reviewing court has the power\nand responsibility of determining whether the regulation\nis valid, and that determination depends on the court's\njudgment as to the arbitrariness of the regulation and\nits consistency with the statutory grant of power.\nA The Assurance Requirement in General\nPreliminarily we emphasize that the requirement to\nsubmit an assurance is not a requirement to sign any\nparticular form. The Handbook relating to federally\nfinanced welfare programs contains a form (CB-FS 5022)\n- 48 -\n\nwhich a state welfare agency could sign in order to\ncomply with the HEW regulation. But this form is merely\nprovided for the convenience and assistance of the state\nwelfare agencies. HEW has never insisted that this\nparticular form be signed, and it has always stood ready\nto accept any written statement of the Alabama Department\nthat contained information and commitment specifically called\nfor in (cid:129)80.4(b) of the regulation. The letter of the\nAlabama Department of August 20, 1965, was rejected by HEW\nas an inadequate assurance, not because the HEW recommended\nform had not been submitted, but because of the content of\nthe purported assurance, or more precisely, because the\nAlabama Department failed to provide in that letter the\ncommitment and information called for by the regulation.\nSee pp. 11-15, supra. The regulation requires the state\nagency, in this assurance, to identify the areas and degree\nof noncompliance with Title VI and substantive provisions\nof the regulation, to commit itself to undertake appropriate\nmeasures and to describe the-\"methods of administration\" to\nbe implemented by the state agency to correct the non-\ncompliance. The assurance requirement is a procedure for\ninitiating the NEW enforcement program by casting the\n- 49 -\n\nk\nresponsibility on the state agency to devise and implement\nmeasures to bring its welfare program into accord with\nfederal civil rights requirements.\nIt seems hardly debatable that it is reasonable for\nr\na federal agency, as a condition of dispensing to a state\nagency almost $100,000,000 a year from the United States\nTreasury, to require the state agency to make some commit-\nment that the money will be spent in conformity with the\nrequirements of federal law, in this instance Title VI.\nThe agency needs some enforceable assurance that the program\nwill be operated, or, in one sense, the money spent as\nfederal law requires. Moreover, it is also eminently\nreasonable for the federal agency to place the responsi-\nbility on the state agency - the direct recipient - to\nmake an inventory of the areas of noncompliance in its\nprograms,and also to formulate methods of administration\nfor correcting that noncompliance. Under Title VI HEW\nis charged with the responsibility of eliminating racial\ndiscrimination in the great variety of welfare programs\nthroughout the Nation that are assisted by federal funds.\nWithout some basic information or assistance from the state\nagencies, it would be impossible for HEW to make a survey\n- 50 -\n\nof every aspect of every state welfare program and to\nformulate correctional measures. This would require HEW\nto deal directly, not with a signle state agency such as\nthe Alabama Department,(cid:9) but with an endless multitude\nof county and regional welfare offices, nursing homes,\nchild day-care centers, child-caring residential institu-\ntions, hospitals, clinics, private physicians, and other\nagencies integrally involved in the statewide welfare\nprogram. The administrative burdens on HEW, especially\nsince this would have to be done not just for Alabama\nbut for all the States, would be virtually insurmountable.\nThis assurance requirement is particularly appropriate\nbecause it conforms to the basic structure of the welfare\nstatutes and regulations initially establishing the\nassistance programs. These laws place the responsibility\nof formulating and implementing a plan on the state agency,\nand require reports from the state agency regarding this\nperformance. For example, Title IV of the Social Security\n1f/ Cf. Lee v. Macon County Board of Education,(M.D. Ala.,\nCA 604-E, March 22, 1967), where the three judge-district\ncourt sought to have a single state agency, the State\nSuperintendent of Education, assist in having local\nschool systems throughout the state adopt consitutionally\nrequired desegregation plans.\n- 51 -\n\nAct, which covers aid to needy families and is involved\nin this proceeding, provides that the state agency must\n0\nsubmit for the approval of the Secretary a plan that\naccords with certain standard, and it authorizes the\nSecretary to stop further payments under the program if\nin the administration of the approved plan there is a\nfailure to satisfy statutory criteria. 42 U.S.C. (cid:129)(cid:129) 602,\n604. See also 42 U.S.C. (cid:129)(cid:129)302, 305 (Old Age Assistance);\n(cid:129)(cid:129)1202,1204 (Aid to the Blind); (cid:129)(cid:129)1352, 1354 (Aid to the\nPermanently, and Totally Disabled). In many respects the\nrequirement to submit a Title VI assurance is like the\nrequirement of the state agency to formulate and submit\na basic plan. It is merely-an adaptation of the standard\nfederal-state arrangement by which a state qualifies for\nfederal welfare assistance. The assurance requirement\nrecognizes or presupposes the primary responsibility of\nthe state agency in the operation of the state-wide welfare\nprogram and asks the state agency to identify the areas of\nracial discrimination and to formulate and submit methods\nof administration for eliminating that racial discrimination.\n- 52 -\n\nIt is also of some significance that, apart\nfrom Title VI, in other federal assistance programs\nassurances of one sort or another have to be filed\nindicating the way in which the applicant intends to\noperate if the federal agency grant what it seeks.\nSee for example, the Impacted Areas Act, 20 U.S.C.\n19/\n(cid:129)636; the Hill-Burton Hospital Act 42 U.S.C. 291(e).\nMoreover, the provision in the HEW regulation in\nquestion requiring the submission of an assurance has\nits parallel in the regulations promulgated by other\nFederal agencies under (cid:129)602 of Title VI of the Civil\n19 / That section provides in pertinent part:\n(b)(1) Each application by a local educational agency\nshall set forth the project for the construction of school\nfacilities for such agency with respect to which it is\nfiled, and shall contain or be supported by --\n(B) assurance that such agency has or will\nhave title to the site, or the right to con-\nstruct upon such site school facilities as\nspecified in the application and to maintain\nsuch school facilities on such site for a\nperiod of not less than twenty years after the\ncompletion of the construction;\n(C) assurance that such agency has legal\nauthority to undertake the construction of the\nproject and to finance any non-Federal share of\nthe cost thereof as proposed, and assurance that\nadequate funds to defray any such non-Federal\nshare will be available when needed;\n(D) assurance that such agency will cause work\non the project to be commenced within a reasonable\ntime and prosecuted to completion.with reasonable\ndiligence;\n(Cont. on following` page)\n- 53 -\n\nRights Act. See, for example, 32 C.F.R. §300.6(h)\n(Dept. of Defense); 43 C.F.R. (cid:129)17.)4(b)(1) (Dept. of\nInterior); 7 C.F.R. (cid:129)15. )4(b) (Dept. of Agriculture).\nFinally, the reasonableness of the assurance\nrequirement and its consistency with the grant \nof\nstatutory power is clearly demonstrated by the\nlegislative history. In the Congressional debate\nit was recognized that the Federal agencies might\nwell rely upon written assurances as one of many\nmeans to implement Title VI. Senator Pastore said\n(110 Cong. Rec. 7059, 196)4):\n19/ (Cont. from preceding page)\n(E) assurance that the rates of pay for\nlaborers and mechanics engaged in the con-\nstruction will be not less than the prevail-\ning local wage rates for similar work as\ndetermined in accordance with sections 276a\nto 276a-5 of Title 40;\n(F) assurance that the school facilities\nof such agency will be available to the\nchildren for whose education contributions\nare provided in this chapter on the same\nterms, in accordance with the laws of the\nState in which the school district of such\nagency is situated, as they are available\nto other children in such school district;\nand\n(G) assurance that such agency will from\ntime to time prior to the completion of the\nproject submit such reports relating to the\nproject as the Commissioner may reasonably\nrequire.\n- 54 -\n\n0\n\"The rule or regulation issued by the\nparticular Federal agency would vary,\ndepending on the nature and method of\nadministration of the particular assist-\nance program. There might be rules, for\nexample, governing the conduct of recipi-\nents of assistance, or orders specifying\na standard form of written assurance or\nunderstanding to be given by each appli-\ncant for assistance, or perhaps a standard\nprovision-of-assistance contract.\"\nAnd Senator Ribicoff added (Id. at 7066):\n\"For example, the most effective way\nfor an agency to proceed [under Title VI]\nwould often be to adopt a rule that made\nthe nondiscrimination requirement part of\na contractual obligation on the part of the\nrecipient. Then violation of such a require-\nment would normally give the agency the right\nto bring a lawsuit to enforce its own contract\nThus, we submit that the HEW regulation requiring the sub-\nmission of an assurance is eminently reasonable and con-\nsistent with the statute, and that it is therefore valid.\n- 55 -\n\nB. Responsibility of the Alabama Department for\nRacially Discriminatory Practices of Third Parties. The\nAlabama Department's refusal to submit the required assur-\nance has been based primarily on the ground that such an(cid:9) €\nassurance would conunit it to taking some action to eliminate\nracial discrimination practiced by third parties--such as\nhospitals, nursing homes or doctors--that are used in\nconnection with the state welfare program.\nThe Alabama Department claims that because it does\nnot own or operate such third party facilities, it has no\ncontrol over them, and that therefore the HEW regulation\nis invalid because it requires the state welfare agency to\nsubmit an assurance in which it would assume responsibility\nfor eliminating racial discrimination where it has no power\nto do so. The Alabama Department disclaims all responsibility\nfor the elimination of racial discrimination in the services\nperformed by those facilities or institutions for welfare\nrecipients. In support of that contention the Alabama\nDepartment puts forward various hypothetical situations,\nmostly involving segregated waiting rooms of a white physi-\ncian who happens to be the only doctor in the county; and\nit maintains that since there is \"nothing\" that it could\ndo to eliminate racial discrimination in such instances, it\nis essentially arbitrary to make it promise to do so.\n- 56 -\n\nThere are four reasons why their argument is wrong.\nFirst, appellees' reliance on hypothetical situations, such\nas those relating to segregated waiting rooms of physicians,\nobscures the posture of this case. This litigation does\nnot involve the validity of application of the HEW regula-\ntion to particular third-party situations or the institu-\ntion of administrative proceedings for failure by Alabama\nto take action against particular third parties. Instead,\nwhat is at stake in this litigation is only the general question\nwhether the Alabama Department is obliged to assume any\nresponsibility to take reasonable steps to eliminate racial\ndiscrimination in facilities and services provided by\n20/\nthird parties. (cid:9) No useful purpose would be served by hav-\ning this Court attempt to anticipate all possible applica-\ntion of the regulations, and to speculate that the regula-\ntion might conceivably be applied by HEW to some third\nparty situation in a way that would be invalid. The\nCorp.\n20/ Compare Times Film   v. City of Chicago, 365 U.S.\n1+T9 50 (1961),h ewre the challenge was to tre agency's \"basic\nauthority\", and the Supreme Court disclaimed intimating any\nview, \"as to what may be decided when a concrete case invol-\nving a specific standard provided by this ordinance is\npresented. a..\"\n- 57 -\n\nreasonableness of any particular administrative action\nunder the HEW regulation would be subject to judicial\nreview when such an application is made and challenged,\nand nothing in this case would foreclose the reviewing\ncourt from deciding for itself the legality of such an.\napplication. The limited question to be decided by\nthis court is whether HEW can lawfully require the\nAlabama Department to assume some responsibility for\nthe racial- discrimination practiced by third parties\nin connection with performing services under the state\nwelfare program, or to state the question conversely,\nwhether the Alabama Department is entitled to disclaim\nall responsibility for racial discrimination of these\nfacilities and institutions.\nSecond, it must be recognized that the HEW\nregulation does not require the Alabama Department to\neliminate racial discrimination practiced by third\nparties at the risk of having all funds terminated or\nthe assurance breached. What it is asking the Alabama\nDepartment to assume is some responsibility for the\nelimination of racial discrimination practiced by third\nparties. It is asking the Alabama Department to j(cid:9) to\ndo something. Moreover, it is not asking the Alabama\n- 58 -\n\nDepartment--any more than it asked all 49 other state\nwelfare departments--to attempt to accomplish something\nwhere it has no power to do so and there is no chance\nof success. The state agency knows which third parties\nperform services for welfare recipients; it is in a\nsuitable position to report on the extent of noncom-\npliance in such activities; and it can take many steps,\nincluding negotiations, to bring about an end to racial\ndiscrimination in those institutions and facilities.\nIndeed, some of these so-called third parties partici-\npate in the vendor payment program and, as stated in the\nSecretary's order, the Alabama Department \"either directly\nor through other state agencies...n.egotiates or sets the\nfees which it will pay and...is involved--as the Agency\nitself admits--in at least 'helping' make arrangements\nfor medical care'if requested to do so9'\"LR.28;A.Vol.II,\np.293]. The regulation merely requires the state welfare\nagency to take reasonable steps to obtain compliance by the\nthird parties,and if compliance cannot be obtained within a\nreasonable time, to make adjustment to cease using those\n\nparticular noncomplying facilities. As the Secretary\nclearly stated in his order:\nOur Regulation under Title VI is based\nupon the premise that most of those provid-\ning  such services can be persuaded to provide\nthem nondiscriminatorily and to the extent\nthey will not, that Federal funds should not\nbe paid to help perpetuate such discriminatory\npractices against innocent beneficiaries.\nAlternate, acceptable services should be found\nand developed.\nThe Alabama agency has refused to be a party\nto such persuasion and administrative action,\nat least until it has exhausted its rights to\njudicial review. Assuming the legality of our\nRegulation were upheld, the Agency apparently\nwould then accept responsibility for seeking\nthird party compliance -- although, of course,\nit will have no greater power then to compel\nsuch compliance than it now has [R. 30; A. Vol.\nII, pp. 297-298].\nThird, we submit that these third parties are\nwithin the coverage of Title VI because they perform ser-\nvices that are an integral part of the state welfare pro-\ngram. We deal, not with the prohibition of the Constitu-\ntion in this case, but with a specific statute regulating\nthe distribution of federal funds, and that statute, pro-\nhibits these third parties from engaging in racial dis-\ncrimination in their performance of services under the\nstate welfare program. Title VI declares in the most\ncomprehensive terms that no person shall be \"subjected\nto discrimination under any program or activity receiving\nFederal financial assistance,\" and, as has been recognized\nin the plans submitted by the Alabama Department, the pro-\nvision of welfare and medical services by these third\nparties or vendor facilities is an integral part of the\n\nstate welfare program. It is through these third par-\nties the Alabama Department implements and discharges\nits responsibilities to welfare recipients, and the ser-\nvices performed by these facilities are in this very real\nsense a part of the state welfare program. Although these\nfacilities are not owned or operated by the state, the\nservices are obtained through contractual or other arrange-\nments with the state agency, and to subject a person to\ndiscrimination in the provision of third-party services\nto subject him to discrimination under the state's welfare\nprogram. See A. Vol. II, pp. 214-216 (Hearing Examiner's\ndescription of the role of these third party facilities in\nthe state welfare program). Indeed for many welfare bene-\nficiaries it is only in the area of services rendered by\nthird parties that discrimination can be practiced against\nthem, and the third-party area is, therefore, precisely\n21/\nthe point at which they most need the protection of Title VI.\n2]./ By way of analogy we note that language similar to\nthat of Title VI has been read to cover not only discrimi-\nnation in the services provided by a common carrier's motor\nvehicle, but also services provided by third parties which\nby contractual or other arrangements provide services to\npatrons of the carrier. The pertinent statute, (cid:129)216(d) of\nthe Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. 316(d), provides\nthat \"it shall be unlawful for any common carrier . . . to\nsubject any particular person . . . to any unjust discrimi-\nnation or any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage\nin any respect whatsoever....\" The Supreme Court held that\nit was a violation of the carrier's duty for it to arrange\nto use a terminal where discrimination was practiced against\nthe carrier's passengers. Boynton v. Virginia, 364 U.S. 454\n(1960).\nPursuant to the Boynton decision the I.C.C. issued a\nregulation providing that:\n(Cont. on following page)\n- 61 -(cid:9)\n\nTo subject a person to racial discrimination in obtaining\nor receiving these services from such third parties, is, we\nsubmit, in essence, to subject them to racial discrimination\nunder the state welfare program.\n21/ (Cont. from preceding page)\nC\n180 a(4) Discrimination in terminal facilities\nNo motor common carrier of passengers subject to\nsection 216 of the Interstate Commerce Act shall\nin the operation of vehicles in interstate or\nforeign commerce provide, maintain arrangements\nfor, utilize, make available, adhere to any under-\ndsit anngy fcr the availability of, ... any terminal\nfacilities which are so operated, arranged, or\nmaintained as to involve any separation of any\nportion thereof, or in the use thereof on the\nbasis of race, color, creed or national origin.\n(Emphasis added.)\nA three-judge court in State of Georgia v. United\nStates, 201 F. Supp. 813 (N.D. Ga. 1961), aff'd. 371 U.S.\n9 (1962) upheld this regulation. Similarly, (cid:129)216(d) has\nbeen read to cover discrimination in waiting rooms in\nterminal facilities, see United States v. Lassiter, 203 F.\nSupp. 20 (W.D. La. 1962) aff'd, 371 U.S. 10 (1962), and in\nterminal restaurants, see Boynton v. Virginia, 364 U.S. 454,\n457-463 (1960). Accord Baldwin v. Morgan, 287 F. 2d 750\n(C.A. 5, 1961); United States v. City of Jackson, Missis-\nsippi, 318 F. 2d 1 C.A. 5, 1963).\n62 -\n- \n\nFourth, the legislative history clearly demonstrates\nthat Congress intended to reach such third parties, particu-\nlarly third party facilities used under the vendor payment\nprogram. For example, in the course of the congressional\nyearings, the then Secretary Celebrezze made it clear that\nunder Title VI the state walfare agencies would have to make\nadjustments in their vendor payment programs:\nSecy . CP1Phrezze: In the vendor payment for\nmedical care of public assistance reci-\npients, we know that there are participat-\ning hospitals, nursing homes, and clinics\nin all sections of the country which engage\nin racial discrimination in some degree.\nMany adjustments may be necessary, such as\ngreater use of local governmental facilities\nwhere they are available, provision for\ntransporting patients to more distant insti-\ntutions, perhaps special contract arrangements\nwith some community hospitals for nondis-\ncriminatory treatment of their indigent patients.\n2/ Excerpts from hearings before Subcommittee No. 5 of the\nHouse Committee on the Judiciary on H.R. 7152, 88th Cong.,\n1st Sess., pp. 1544-1546. See also, Additional Views on H.R.\n7152 of Hon. William W. McCulloch, Hon. John V. Lindsay, Hon.\nWilliam T. Cahill, Hon. Garner E. Shriver, Hon. Clark MacGregor,\nHon. Charles McC. Mathias, Hon. James E. Bromwell, House Com-\nmitte on the Judiciary, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 24, where it\nis explicitly stated that vendor payment programs are covered\nby Title VI:\n(footnote cont'd)\n- 63 -\n\nMr. Cramer: In the vendor payment programs\nfor medical care for your public\nrecipients, that is administered by\nthe local public welfare board, is\nit not?\nK\nSecy. Celebrezze: Yes, to a degree, but\nthe payments are made directly to the\nsupplier of the service by the States.\nMr. Cramer: The States determine whether the\nperson is qualified to receive welfare\npayments, do they not?\nSecy . Celebrezze: Under the vendor payment\nprogram, yes. The State has to adopt\nit. We have to adopt it under the\nState program. Once we adopt the State\nprogram under vendor payment, they make\nthe payments directly to the physician\nor directly to the hospital, whatever\nthe case may be, under the vendor\npayment program.\nMr. Cramer: Therefore, you would not make\npayments to a doctor, for instance, who\nchose a hospital or nursing home that\npracticed discrimination. If the doctor\nchose a given nursing home and that\nnursing home discriminated, you could not\nmake payment to that doctor, is that\ncorrect?\n3' \n(footnote cont'd)\n\"In a related fashion, racial dis-\ncrimination has been found to exist in vendor\npayment programs for medical care of public\nassistance recipients. Hospitals, nursing\nhomes, and clinics in all parts of the country\nparticipate in these programs and, in some,\nNegro recipients have received less than equal\nadvantage.\"\n(cid:9)\n64 -\n(cid:9)\nH i\n\nSecy. Celebrezze: This isn't the way in which\nI described it in my statement. In my\nstatement I said that the reason we wanted\ndiscretion rather than completely cutting\nit off is that I am dealing with human problems.\nIf we completely cut off funds we still have\nthese sick people we have to send to hospitals.\nIf the only hospital that is available is a\nsegregated hospital, and it is a matter of life\nor death with the individual, we would have to\nsend them to that particular hospital. Mean-\nwhile, I would try to make other arrangements\nlater on either to use other governmental facili-\nties or other institutions that can render service.\nIf a man needs medical attention we are not go-\ning to argue about the treatment while the patient\nis dying.\nMr. Cramer: I understand that, but I wanted to get\ninto the aspect that you would be controlling\nthe choice of either the doctor or patient or\nthe nurse as to the hospital or clinic or nurs-\ning home to which he might wish to go.\nSecy. Celebrezze: When a man goes into the hospital\nhe certainly gets medical treatment and we are\nnot concerned as to the doctor who treats him.\nThat is a question we are not primarily concerned\nwith at this point. We may have that decision\ncoming out of the separate-but-equal lawsuit under\nthe Hill-Burton program. That is why I say that\nit is difficult to define these areas. Take the\nHill-Burton program, for example. Let us assume\nthe hospital is integrated, but it only has whites\non its medical staff. What decision do you as\nan administrator come to?\nAre you concerned that the patient is\ntreated equally or are you also concerned with\nthe internal operations of the hospital? These\nare difficult decisions. That is why I say there\nare a hundred different ways this may apply.\n- 65 -\n\nMr. Cramer: But you have authority under\nTitle VI if a given hospital does not\nhave any Negro doctors on the staff to\nwithhold funds under the vendor payment\nprogram and thus prevent a person from\ngoing to that hospital and receive medical\nservice at that hospital.\n0\nSecy. Celebrezze: You could do that if you\ncarried it that far, and wanted to get into\nthe internal management of the hospital.\nMr. Cramer: You have it under Title VI if you\nwish to use it; right?\nSecy. Celebrezze: I think we could.\nMr. Cramer: The same is true in a nursing home.\nIf in fact a given nursing home refuses to\nemploy Negro nurses, for instance, but permits\nNegroes as patients, you would have authority\nto cut off funds?\nSecy . Celebrezze: We can go on and on with examples.\nMr. Cramer: Precisely.\nThus, for these reasons we believe there is no merit to the\nAlabama Department's contention in that the HEW regulation re-\nquiring the submission of an assurance is unlawful because\nthe submission of such an assurance would commit it to try-\ning to eliminate racial discrimination in third party\nfacilities that are used as an integral part of the welfare\nprogram.\n- 66 -\n\nC. Responsibility With Respect to\nDirect Services. The Alabama Department's primary\ncontention with respect to its responsibility under\nthe HEW regulation relates to the services performed\nby so-called third parties. However, the Alabama\nDepartment, by refusing to submit the required\nassurance, has also refused to assume the responsibility\nimposed under the HEW regulation with respect to the\nservices and programs directly operated by it. Al-\nthough the Alabama Department has insisted that it\ndoes not deny benefits on account of race, it has\nnot; as found by the Secretary, adequately identified\nthe extent to which racial discrimination exists in,\nfor example, the physical facilities used by the\nstate agencies and the assignment of case workers,\nnor has the Alabama Department formulated or proposed\nadequate methods of administration for correcting that\nracial discrimination [R.23-24; A.Vol.II,  pp.285-287].\nIt has not, for instance, provided for the dissemina-\ntion of information about the rights and responsibilities\nunder Title VI; nor has it proposed any system of sur-\nveying compliance, for keeping records or for filing\nreports that would enable performance to be properly\n- 67 -\n\n'I,\nevaluated; nor has it formulated a complaint procedure\nthat would give beneficiaries an adequate opportunity\nto present complaints of alleged noncompliance. The\nAlabama Department has refused to acknowledge any\nresponsibility for doing these things, and has thus\nchallenged the validity of the HEW regulation requir-\ning the submission of the assurance because, in that\nassurance, the state agency must identify areas of\nnoncompliance and propose methods of administration\ndesigned to eliminate that noncompliance.\nAs was true of the other contentions respect-\ning the validity of the HEW regulation,.this conten-\ntion is without merit. If Title VI is going to have\nany meaning with respect to the federally financed\nwelfare program, HEW must have the power, through\nthe promulgation of regulations under section 602,\nto require the Alabama Department to take such\nsteps with respect to its direct programs and\nactivities. There can be no doubt that such programs\nand activities are within the coverage of Title VI,\nand that HEW was entitled to impose the initial\nresponsibility on the state welfare agency to make\n- 68 -\n\nan inventory of its own activities and programs,\nand to propose methods of administration for\nbringing that program or agency into compliance\nwith Title VI.\nIII. Other Questions Relating to the Validit\nof the Secretary's Order.\nIn the proceedings before the District Court\nthe attorneys for the Alabama Department stated that\nthe state agency would submit the required assurance\nif the HEW regulation were judicially determined to\nbe valid. Similarly, if the regulation is determined\nto be invalid, the Secretary will not seek to give\nhis order effect. Hence, the principal question\nbefore this Court is the validity of that regulation.\nHowever, aside from the validity of the regula-\ntion, certain other questions are raised in the\ncomplaint filed in the District Court relating to the\nvalidity of the Secretary's order, and in the interest\nof completeness we deal with those questions here.\n- 69 -\n\nA. Procedural Questions\nIn paragraph 16A of its first amended complaint,\nit is claimed also the Secretary's order is invalid\nbecause he erred in denying the following three motions (cid:9) _\nor requests: (1) the request of the Alabama Depart-\nment to make an oral presentation before him; (2) the\nmotion of the Alabama Department to be allowed to\npresent further evidence and current data concerning\ncivil rights in Alabama relating to grants and\nservices under the child welfare and public assistance\nprograms; (3) the motion of the Alabama Department to\nbe allowed to incorporate into the proceeding the\nquestion whether its proposed Medical Assistance plan\nor program under Title XIX of the Social Security\nAct, 42 U.S.C. 1396, satisfies the requirements\nof Title VI.\nWe believe that the Secretary did not err in\ndenying these motions and requests.\n(1) The Secretary has the discretion to\ndecide whether there should be oral presentation\nbefore him, and in the circumstances of this case\nhe did not abuse that discretion in denying the\nrequest. There was a full evidentiary hearing be-\n\nfore the Hearing Examiner; there was written and\noral presentation to the Commissioner of Welfare;\nand the issues were fully explored in the exhibits,\nbriefs, recommendations, and decisions that were\nbefore the Secretary.\n(2) The offer of the Alabama Department\nto introduce allegedly \"current\" evidence of\nracial discrimination in the operation of the\nfederally-assisted child welfare and public assistance\nprograms in Alabama was properly rejected by the\nSecretary. That evidence could in no way justify\nthe failure of Alabama to comply with the require-\nment of the HEW regulation to submit an assurance\nidentifying the remaining areas of noncompliance\nand describing methods of administration formulated\nand adopted by the agency to eliminate that non-\ncompliance. As the Secretary stated in his decision,\n\"such evidence of decreased discrimination alone\nwould not compensate for the failure of the Alabama\nagency to commit itself to achieve non-discriminatory\ncare and services in Federally-assisted programs as\ncalled for in Section 80.1(b) of this Department's\n- 71 -\n\nRegulation. Were it willing to do so, however, this\nevidence would, of course, be relevant and needed\nto evaluate the adequacy of the methods of administra-\ntion which it would propose to use to assure com-\npliance with Title VI.\" [A.Vol.II, p.278].\nC\n(3) The Alabama Department's motion to\nincorporate Title XIX in the proceedings was, in\nthe Secretary's judgment untimely and an inappro-\npriate manner to resolve conflicts over the-Title\nVVI_requirements with respect to that program.\nMoreover, it is difficult to understand how the\nfailure of the Secretary to include Title XIX within\nthe proceeding before him could render invalid his order'\nthat affect only Titles I, IV, V(part3), X, and XIV.\nIf it was expedited consideration that the Alabama\nDepartment wanted, the Secretary made clear that\ncould be achieved without incorporating Title XIX\nin this proceeding. He said:\nThis Department shares the\nexpressed interest of the\nAlabama welfare agency in\nbringing the benefits of\nTitle XIX to the people of\nAlabama as soon as possible.\nWe stand ready to help it\nto resolve all of the issues-\ncivil rights and otherwise -\nwhich presently stand in the\nway of approval of its Title\nXIX plan.\n- 72 -\n\nIf the Commissioner of Wel-\nfare determines that voluntary\ncompliance with Title VI re-\nquirements cannot be obtained\nfor that plan, formal action\non the matters in dispute will\nbe expedited.[A.Vol.II,p.279.]\nB.

The Alabama Department also contends\nthat the initiation of termination proceedings by\nHEW here, as opposed to his employing \"other means\nauthorized by law\", was arbitrary and capricious\nand that therefore the Secretary's order is invalid.\nIn support of that contention, a, statement made by\nSenator Ribicoff during the course of the congressional\ndebate on Title VI is cited, and that statement reads\nas follows:\nSixth***The remedies provided by\nsection 602 are withholding of\nassistance and any other means\nauthorized by law. In general,\nthe consistent-with-the objectives\nrequirement would make withholding\nof funds a last resort, to be used\nonly when other means authorized\nby law were unavailable or in-\neffective.\n- 73 -\n\nTo make that clear: The with-\nholding of funds would be the\nlast step to be taken only after\nthe administrator or the agency\nhad used every other possible\nmeans to persuade or to influence\nthe person or the agency offending\nto stop the discrimination.\nSeventh. Looking first to the\n'other means authorized by law',\nthe agency could, for example,\nask the Attorney General to\ninitiate a lawsuit under Title\nIV, if the recipient were a\nschool district or public col-\nlege; or the agency could use\nany of the remedies available\nto it by virtue of its own\n'rule, regulation, or order of\ngeneral applicability.' For ex-\nample, the most effective way for\nan agency to proceed would often\nbe to adopt a rule that made the\nnondiscrimination requirement\npart of a contractual obligation\non the part of the recipient.\nThen violation of such a require-\nment would normally give the\nagency the right to bring a law-\nsuit to enforce its own contract;\nor, in the absence of a technical\ncontract, the agency would have\nauthority to sue to enforce com-\npliance with its own regulations.\nAll of these remedies have the\nobvious advantage of seeking to\nend the discrimination, rather\nthan to end the assistance. (110\nCong. Rec. 6846, daily ed.,\nApril 7, 196)+. )\n- 74 -\n\nHEW has consistently recognized that adminis-\ntrative proceedings to terminate assistance is \"a\nlast resort\",to be used when all else fails. The\npurpose of Title VI and HEW's enforcement program\nis not to terminate federal assistance, but to -\neliminate racial discrimination in federally-assisted\nprograms. But the record in this case clearly\ndemonstrates that it was the Alabama Department's\nrepeated refusal to comply with regulations after\ntwo years of constant efforts by HEW to secure\nvoluntary compliance that led to the initiation\nof termination proceedings and the Secretary's\norder. Indeed, in this case termination of federal\nfinancial assistance was \"the last step\" and \"a\nlast resort\" to obtain compliance with the regula-\ntion, and Section 80.8(b) of the presidentially\napproved regulations specifically authorizes the\nagency to terminate federal financial assistance\naccording to prescribed procedures, such as those\nmeticulously followed in this case when a recipient\nrefuses to furnish the assurance required under\nsection 80.4 of the Regulations.\n- 75 -\n\nThe commencement of administrative proceedings was an\nappropriate and effective manner, authorized by the statute\nand the regulation, to implement the requirements of the\nregulation. It gave the Alabama Department an opportunity\nto litigate its challenge to the enforcement program, and (cid:9) €\nfor this Court to review the validity of the .relation\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, it is respectfully sub-\nmitted that the order of the District Court should be\nreversed and vacated and the complaint dismissed, and the\norder of the Secretary should be reviewed on Alabama's\nalternative petition for review and held valid.\nJOHN DOAR,\nAssistant Attorney General,\nMACON L.

We have consistently recognized\n\nthe right of the Alabama Department to seek review of\nadministrative action in the District Court wherever\nthe remedy provided by special review provisions is\n\"inadequate;\" but we reject the contention that the\nspecific statutory remedy of the Social Security\nAct - direct judicial review by the Court of Appeals -\nis in this instance \"inadequate.\" Thus, the principal\nissue that divides us on the jurisdictional question\nis simply: Would direct judicial review by this\nCourt of Appeals of the Secretary's order terminating\nfederal financial assistance be inadequate?\nWe believe that judicial review of the\nSecretary's order by the Court of Appeals is entirely\nadequate. A petition for review in the Court of\nAppeals affords the State an effective remedy - an\nadjudication of the legality of the HEW regulation\nunderlying the Secretary's termination order.\nIn its Supplemental Memorandum the Alabama\nDepartment finds a \"potential analogy\" to support\nits contention that the remedy in this Court is\ninadequate in the recent decisions of the Supreme\nCourt in Toilet Goods Association v. Gardner,\n- 2 -\n\nAbbott Laboratories v. Gardner and Gardner v. Toilet\nGoods Association, 35 U.S. Law Week 424.31, 4433, and\n4439 (May 22, 1967). As we understand the Memorandum,\nthe State relies on those cases only insofar as they\nlend support to the following proposition:\nIf the Secretary is correct in stating that\nhe had no authority to strike down his regula-\ntion or requirement, then the administrative\nproceeding was palpably inadequate for deciding\nthe issue, and such inadequacy, in our opinion,\nwould be transferred to any specific statutory\nprovision for a review of the Secretary's\ndecision in a Court of Appeals. (Supplemental\nMemorandum, p. 8).\nHowever, we do not read the recent Supreme Court\ndecisions as lending any support to such a proposition.\nIndeed, as we read those cases, they reject that\nproposition, which, as a practical matter would permit\na party to avoid a specific statutory review procedure\n(such as those vesting the Court of Appeals with\nexclusive jurisdiction) whenever the party sought a\nlegal determination of the validity of the regulation\nunderlying the administrative action, and the adminis-\ntrative agency considered itself bound by one of its\nregulations.\n- 3 -\n\nIn the(cid:9) cases in question the Supreme Court\nrepeatedly recognized that the HEW regulations being\nchallenged did not fall within the enumerated\ncategories of regulations which were the subject of\nspecial statutory review procedures providing direct\nreview in the Court of Appeals. See Abbott\nLaboratories v. Gardner, 35 U.S. Law Week 4L33,\n4434 (May 22, 1967). See also footnote 4 and the\npertinent text in the dissenting opinion of\nMr. Justice Fortas. 35 U.S. Law Week at 4443.\nThe implication is that for regulations falling within\nthe statutory categories review would be had in\nthe statutorily designated forum, even if the\nvalidity of that regulation were being challenged,\nand without regard to whether the administrator\nwould consider the merits of a claim that the\nregulation was invalid. Thin, we believe, is\ninconsistent with the proposition the State now\nurges on this Court.\n\nThe proposition put forward by the State was\nmore explicitly rejected in one of those cases, Toilet\nGoods Association v. Gardner, 35 U.S. Law Week 4431,\ninvolving the \"access\" regulation of HEW, which requires\ndrug firms to grant access to certain manufacturing\nfacilities and records at the threat of suspension of\nFDA certification. Parties subject to the regulation\nchallenged its validity by commencing a civil action in\nthe District Court without having first exhausted the\nadministrative remedies, and the Supreme Court held\nthat such a pre-enforcement challenge was inappropriate.\nThe Court required the parties to go through the\nadministrative process and then seek judicial review\nin the statutorily prescribed forum - even though, as\nthe Court explicitly acknowledged, it was entirely\npossible \"that the Commissioner will not entertain\nand consider a challenge to his statutory authority\nto promulgate the regulation.\" 35 U.S. Law Week at\n4433. The Court noted that review of the Commission's\ndecision might be in either the District Court or the\nCourt of Appeals. 35 U.S. Law Week at 4432, footnote 3.\nBut it was clear that the Court was of the view that\n- 5 -\n\nthe choice of forum would turn on the construction\nof the special review provisions. The decision as to\nwhich forum was proper would be based upon a determination.\nof whether the particular administrative action in\nquestion (suspension by the Commissioner for refusal\nof access) was encompassed in the special review\nprovisions, and not on whether the party challenged\nthe validity of the regulation or whether the Commissioner\npassed on the merits of that claim.\nMore generally, it could be said of the cases\ndiscussed in the State's Supplemental Memorandum\nthat they are not at all addressed to the issue now\nbefore this Court - whether review by the specially\ndesignated forum is \"inadequate\" within the meaning\nof the Administrative Procedure Act. Instead, the\nSupreme Court was there concerned with an entirely\ndifferent issue - under what circumstances could a\njudicial determination of the validity of an\nadministrative regulation be had prior to any enforce-\nment action by the agency. The Court held that\nsuch a judicial determination could be had if Congress\ndid not prohibit it and if the challenge was \"ripe.\"\n-6-\n\nAnd it was solely in the limited context of deciding\nwhether the challenge was \"ripe\" that the Supreme\nCourt considered, as one of the relevant factors,\nwhether the party was challenging the statutory\nauthority for promulgating the regulation. The Court\ntook the view that such a challenge might be more\nsuspectible of judicial resolution in a pre-enforcement\ninjunctive action than in a suit whereby the party was\nchallenging a threatened application of the regulation.\nWe do not believe that any useful purpose would\nbe served by having this Court seek to determine\nwhether the State could have maintained a pre-enforcement\nchallenge to this regulation or whether (like the\naccess regulation challenged in Toilet Goods Association\nv. Gardner) the\"judicial appraisal\" of the statutory\npurpose, of the meaning and scope of the regulation,\nand of the enforcement problems of the agency \"is\nlikely to stand on a much surer footing in the context\nof a specific application of this regulation.\" 35 U.S.\nLaw Week at 4432. The fact of the matter is that this\n- 7 -\n\nl/\nis not a pre-enforcement suit.(cid:9) The administrative\nremedies have been exhausted, and this Court has before\nit a specific application of the regulation, the\nadministrative interpretation of the regulation, and\nthe administrative decision. It follows that the\nrecent Supreme Court decisions discussed in the State's\nSupplemental Memorandum have little relevance to the\njurisdictional question before this Court or, more\nspecifically, to the question whether the remedy\nprovided in the Social Security Act (direct review\nin the Court of Appeals) is adequate.\n6, 1965, \nl ,\" On May  Commissioner Ruben K. King sent\nto Dr. Ellen Winston a telegram which stated the\nfollowing: \"State Board of Pensions and Security\nin session today authorized a suit to contest\nvalidity of regulations promulgated by . . .[HEW]\n170,\nunder Title VI of Civil Rights Act.\" (See p. \nVolume I, Appendix to Brief of Secretary Gardner.)\nThis telegram was sent prior to the commencement\nby Dr. Winston of administrative proceedings for\ntermination of the federal grants.\nAfter the sending of the telegram, further\n29,\nnegotiations took place. However, on September \n1965, \nCommissioner King sent Dr. King a telegram\nwith the following message: \"State Board . . .\ntoday reaffirmed authorization for testing validity\nof rules and regulations promulgated by . . .. HEW\n179, \nunder Title VI . . . .\" (See p.  Volume I of\nAppendix.)\nNonetheless, the State Department did not bring\nits action in the district court until after administrative\nproceedings had been completed and Secretary Gardner had\napproved the decision to terminate the federal assistance.\n8 -\n- \n\nWe have thus far discussed the question of the\nadequacy of the statutorily prescribed remedy without\nregard to whether this Court has jurisdiction over\nthe order as it relates to all the programs or whether\nit has jurisdiction only over some - for the State's\nargument based on the recent Supreme Court decisions\ndoes not make that consideration relevant. However,\nanother of the State's arguments, which was made in\nits original brief and which has been renewed in the\n2/\nSupplemental Memorandum rests on the view that even\nif the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to review\nthe order as it relates to four programs (the public\nassistance programs - Titles I, IV, X and XIV), the\nDistrict Court would have exclusive jurisdiction to\nreview the order as it relates to the fifth program\n2/ The State, in its Supplemental Memorandum (pp. 16-17),\nseeks to support its contention as to the inadequacy of\nthe Court of Appeals direct review remedy by noting\nthat it sought to add private individuals as plaintiffs\nin the district court suit. The State asserts that\n\"whatever rights they [the private individuals] have\nmay be relevant to . . . the question of jurisdiction.\"\nRegarding this contention, we rely upon the\ndiscussion in footnote 11 on page 34 of our original\nbrief.\n-9-\n\n(child welfare services - Title V (Part 3)). The\nState contends that this limitation on the scope of\nthe jurisdiction of this Court renders the remedy\nhere \"inadequate.\"\nWe reject the view that only the District\nCourt has jurisdiction to review the Secretary's\norder as it relates to the child welfare services\n38-44 \n(see pp.  of our original brief). But we also\nmaintain that, even on the State's view that the\nSecretary's Order as it relates to the child welfare\nservices program is reviewable only in the District\nCourt, the statutorily prescribed remedy of direct\nreview in the Court of Appeals of the order as it\nrelates to the other programs is nevertheless adequate.\nThe legal question as to the validity of the order\nis the same regardless of which program it relates to.\nWhatever the Court of Appeals decides as to the\nvalidity of the Secretary's order as it pertains to\nTitles I, IV, X and XIV will control the decision\nas to the validity of the Secretary's order as it\n3) \nrelates to Title V (Part  as well. As a practical\nmatter, if the District Court took jurisdiction over\n- 10 -\n\nthe order as it relates to Title V (Part 3), it would\nin all probability hold proceedings in abeyance until\nthe Court of Appeals adjudicated the validity of the\norder as it related to the other four programs. The\nright of the Alabama Department to a judicial deter-\nmination of validity would be protected, and scarce\njudicial resources would be conserved.\nIn response to this line of argument, the State,\nin its original brief, drew on certain language in\nHillsborough v. Cromwell, 326 U.S. 620 (i9Li6) to the\neffect that a remedy was inadequate unless it \"covered\nthe entire case.\" The State asserts that the statement\nwas made in an \"analogous context.\" However, we\ndisagree. As pointed out during oral argument, the\nSupreme Court's statement was made in the context\nof rejecting a position that would have required the\nplaintiff to proceed in both a state court (for an\nadjudication of the state claim) and a federal court\n(for an adjudication of the federal claim) . Unlike\nour case, where the two forums are part of the same\njudicial system and there is a right to appeal the\ndecision of one forum to the other, the Court in\n- 11 -\n\nHillsborough addressed itself to a situation where\na decision in one forum would not necessarily dispose\nof the issue in the other forum and the party might be\nforced to actively litigate in two courts before he\nobtained any relief. In that instance, the Supreme\nCourt broadened the scope of the federal court remedy\nto permit it to reach the state claim, thus making the\nfederal court remedy adequate.\n2. The Meaning of §603.\nThe Alabama Department's principal contention\nwith respect to the jurisdictional question has been\nthat the specific statutory review procedures, vesting\nexclusive jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals, are\n\"inadequate.\" However, in its Supplemental Memorandum\na new argument is put forward viz., that the critical\nlanguage of §603 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\nstating that agency action terminating assistance for\nnoncompliance with the requirements of that Act \"shall\nbe subject to such judicial review as may otherwise\nbe provided by law for similar action taken by such\ndepartment . . . on other grounds,\" does not include\nthe review provisions under the Social Security Act,\n- 12 -\n\n42 U.S.C. §1316. The claim is that this language\nof §603 refers only to special statutory review\nprovisions which were in existence at the time of\nthe enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n(July 2, 1964), not to review provisions such as\nthose in the Social Security Act which were adopted\nsubsequently (July 30, 1965).\nThere is no basis in the statutory language\nor the legislative history for such a limited\ninterpretation of §603. The statute uses the phrase\n\"provided by law,\" and not \"provided by law at the\ntime of the enactment of this Act;\" and similarly\nthe phrase used in the legislative debates and\nquoted in the Alabama Department's Supplemental\n3/\nMemorandum is \"existing law,\" not \"law existing at\n3/ The statement quoted on page 13 of the Alabama\nDepartment's Supplemental Memorandum is that of Senator\nPastore, 110 Cong. Rec. 6842 (daily ed., April 7, 1964);\n110 Cong. Sec. 7060-61 (permanent ed.). Just prior to\nthe statement quoted, Senator Pastore said:\nAdditional safeguards against arbitrary\naction are provided in section 603. Under\nthat section any agency action taken pursuant\nto section 602 would be subject to judicial\nreview to the extent and in the manner provided\nby existing law applicable to similar action\ntaken by the agency on other grounds. Thus,\nwhere special statutory review procedures are\navailable under certain statutes, those\nprocedures should be followed.\n- 13 -\n\nthe time of the enactment of this Act.\" Standard\nprinciples of statutory construction require that\nthe general, open-ended language used in §603 be\nread to include both the statutory review provisions\nexisting at the time of the enactment of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, and those that come into. existence\n4/\nafter enactment.(cid:9) See generally, 2 Sutherland,\nStatutory Construction §5102 (1943); Browder v. United\nStates, 312 U.S. 335, 339 (1941). This principle of\nstatutory construction was recently recognized by the\nSupreme Court in Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U.S. 780 (1966).\n4/ It appears that, under the Alabama Department's\ntheory, §603 would apply neither to special review\nprovisions in acts adopted after July 2, 1964, nor\nto review provisions which were in effect in July, 1964,\nbut were amended thereafter. This would mean, for\nexample, that if Congress were to amend the judicial\nreview provision of the Hill-Burton Act, 42 U.S.C.\n§291(h), to provide that review could take place\nonly in the Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia Circuit (as opposed to the court of appeals\nfor the circuit where the state seeking Hill-Burton\nfunds is located), the amended provision would not be\na special review provision within the meaning of §603,\nsince the amended provision would go into effect after\nJuly 2, 1964.\n- 14 -\n\nIn Georgia v. Rachel, the Supreme Court was\ncalled upon to construe a Reconstruction statute\nwhich provided for the removal to federal district\ncourts of actions \"against any person who is denied\nor cannot enforce in the court of [a] State a right\nunder any law providing for the equal civil rights\nof citizens of the United States . . . .\" See\n28 U.S.C. §1443(1). \nOne issue confronting the Court\n1964 \nwas whether the Civil Rights Act of  could be\nregarded as \"[a] law providing for . . . equal civil\nrights\" within the meaning of the removal statute,\n1964 \nsince the Civil Rights Act of  was enacted\nsubsequent to the time when the phrase \"any law\nproviding for equal civil rights\" was added to\n5/\nthe removal statute. The Supreme Court held that\n1964 \nthe Civil Rights Act of  is encompassed within\nthat removal statute, stating:\n5/ \nThe original removal provision was contained in\n1866. \nthe Civil Rights Act of  The language \"any\nlaw providing for . . . equal civil rights\" first\n1874 \nappeared in  when the Revised Statutes were\n384 U.S.,  788.\ncompiled. See  at \n- 15 -\n\n• . . Congress' choice of the open-ended\nphrase \"any law providing for . . • equal\ncivil rights\" was clearly appropriate to\npermit removal in cases involving \"a right\nunder\" both existing and future statutes\nthat provided for equal civil rights.\n(384 U.S., at 789.)\nThe general open-ended phrase of §603 similarly\nincludes statutory review procedures existing on\nthe date of enactment of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964+, and those enacted thereafter.\nNot only is the Alabama Department's attempt\nto limit the language of §603 without basis in the\nlegislative history, but it is inconsistent with\none of the basic Congressional purposes for enacting\nTitle VI. The practical result of the State's\nconstruction of the language of §603 would mean that\nif the judicial review provisions of a federal grant\nstatute subsequently enacted are to be within the\nreach of §603, it would be necessary for Congress\nto insert an explicit reference to \"discrimination\nunder the Civil Rights Act.\" (See, Supplemental\nMemorandum, p. 15.) This would run counter to one\nof the basic purposes of Title VI - that of avoiding\nthe need to consider the matter of nondiscrimination\n- 16 -\n\neach time a bill providing for federal aid came\nunder consideration. Senator Pastore explained\nthis as follows (110 Cong. Rec. 7061):\nTitle VI would avoid the recurrence of\nacrimonious debate in the Congress as to\ndiscrimination in discussing individual\nFederal aid programs.\nTime and time again such proposed legis-\nlation has come before this body. Amendments\nhave been sponsored to make clear in a\nparticular program that separate but equal\nprovisions would not do.\nIt is to avoid such a situation that\nTitle VI would constitute as permanent\npolicy of the U.S. Government the principle\nthat discrimination will not be tolerated.\nThis would eliminate all the confusion\nand discussion that arise every time a\ngrant bill comes before the Senate.\nIt is clear that Title VI was intended to\napply to programs established in the future as well\nas to those which were in effect in 1964, and, by\nthe same token, there is no reason to distinguish\nbetween specific statutory judicial review provisions\ncreated after July 2, 1964 and those created before.\nWe conclude therefore that, because of the existence\nof 42 U.S.C. §1316, the Court of Appeals is the\nproper forum for review of the order of Secretary.\n- 17 -\n\nCONCLUSION\nAs the State has said in both its briefs,\n\"In any event, the entire case is now before this\nCourt.\" (Supplemeiital Memorandum, p. 18; original\nbrief, p. )45.) We urge this court to decide the\nsubstantive issues on the alternative petition for\nreview rather than on the appeal from the preliminary\ninjunction.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJOHN DOAR,\nAssistant Attorney General,\nMACON L.

The Inadequacy of the Specified Statutory\nRemedy.\nWe have maintained that the exclusive forum\nfor judicial review of the Secretary's order terminating\nassistance to the Alabama Department is that prescribed\nin the Social Security Act for similar action taken\nby the Secretary on other grounds - the Court of\nAppeals.

A petition for review in the Court of\nAppeals affords the State an effective remedy - an\nadjudication of the legality of the HEW regulation\nunderlying the Secretary's termination order.\nIn its Supplemental Memorandum the Alabama\nDepartment finds a \"potential analogy\" to support\nits contention that the remedy in this Court is\ninadequate in the recent decisions of the Supreme\nCourt in Toilet Goods Association v. Gardner,\n- 2 -\n\nAbbott Laboratories v. Gardner and Gardner v. Toilet\nGoods Association, 35 U.S. Law Week 424.31, 4433, and\n4439 (May 22, 1967).

The\nright of the Alabama Department to a judicial deter-\nmination of validity would be protected, and scarce\njudicial resources would be conserved.\nIn response to this line of argument, the State,\nin its original brief, drew on certain language in\nHillsborough v. Cromwell, 326 U.S. 620 (i9Li6) to the\neffect that a remedy was inadequate unless it \"covered\nthe entire case.\" The State asserts that the statement\nwas made in an \"analogous context.\" However, we\ndisagree. As pointed out during oral argument, the\nSupreme Court's statement was made in the context\nof rejecting a position that would have required the\nplaintiff to proceed in both a state court (for an\nadjudication of the state claim) and a federal court\n(for an adjudication of the federal claim) . Unlike\nour case, where the two forums are part of the same\njudicial system and there is a right to appeal the\ndecision of one forum to the other, the Court in\n- 11 -\n\nHillsborough addressed itself to a situation where\na decision in one forum would not necessarily dispose\nof the issue in the other forum and the party might be\nforced to actively litigate in two courts before he\nobtained any relief. In that instance, the Supreme\nCourt broadened the scope of the federal court remedy\nto permit it to reach the state claim, thus making the\nfederal court remedy adequate.\n2. The Meaning of §603.\nThe Alabama Department's principal contention\nwith respect to the jurisdictional question has been\nthat the specific statutory review procedures, vesting\nexclusive jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals, are\n\"inadequate.\" However, in its Supplemental Memorandum\na new argument is put forward viz., that the critical\nlanguage of §603 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\nstating that agency action terminating assistance for\nnoncompliance with the requirements of that Act \"shall\nbe subject to such judicial review as may otherwise\nbe provided by law for similar action taken by such\ndepartment . . . on other grounds,\" does not include\nthe review provisions under the Social Security Act,\n- 12 -\n\n42 U.S.C. §1316. The claim is that this language\nof §603 refers only to special statutory review\nprovisions which were in existence at the time of\nthe enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n(July 2, 1964), not to review provisions such as\nthose in the Social Security Act which were adopted\nsubsequently (July 30, 1965).\nThere is no basis in the statutory language\nor the legislative history for such a limited\ninterpretation of §603. The statute uses the phrase\n\"provided by law,\" and not \"provided by law at the\ntime of the enactment of this Act;\" and similarly\nthe phrase used in the legislative debates and\nquoted in the Alabama Department's Supplemental\n3/\nMemorandum is \"existing law,\" not \"law existing at\n3/ The statement quoted on page 13 of the Alabama\nDepartment's Supplemental Memorandum is that of Senator\nPastore, 110 Cong. Rec. 6842 (daily ed., April 7, 1964);\n110 Cong. Sec. 7060-61 (permanent ed.). Just prior to\nthe statement quoted, Senator Pastore said:\nAdditional safeguards against arbitrary\naction are provided in section 603. Under\nthat section any agency action taken pursuant\nto section 602 would be subject to judicial\nreview to the extent and in the manner provided\nby existing law applicable to similar action\ntaken by the agency on other grounds. Thus,\nwhere special statutory review procedures are\navailable under certain statutes, those\nprocedures should be followed.\n- 13 -\n\nthe time of the enactment of this Act.\" Standard\nprinciples of statutory construction require that\nthe general, open-ended language used in §603 be\nread to include both the statutory review provisions\nexisting at the time of the enactment of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, and those that come into. existence\n4/\nafter enactment.(cid:9) See generally, 2 Sutherland,\nStatutory Construction §5102 (1943); Browder v. United\nStates, 312 U.S. 335, 339 (1941). This principle of\nstatutory construction was recently recognized by the\nSupreme Court in Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U.S. 780 (1966).\n4/ It appears that, under the Alabama Department's\ntheory, §603 would apply neither to special review\nprovisions in acts adopted after July 2, 1964, nor\nto review provisions which were in effect in July, 1964,\nbut were amended thereafter. This would mean, for\nexample, that if Congress were to amend the judicial\nreview provision of the Hill-Burton Act, 42 U.S.C.\n§291(h), to provide that review could take place\nonly in the Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia Circuit (as opposed to the court of appeals\nfor the circuit where the state seeking Hill-Burton\nfunds is located), the amended provision would not be\na special review provision within the meaning of §603,\nsince the amended provision would go into effect after\nJuly 2, 1964.\n- 14 -\n\nIn Georgia v. Rachel, the Supreme Court was\ncalled upon to construe a Reconstruction statute\nwhich provided for the removal to federal district\ncourts of actions \"against any person who is denied\nor cannot enforce in the court of [a] State a right\nunder any law providing for the equal civil rights\nof citizens of the United States . . . .\" See\n28 U.S.C. §1443(1). \nOne issue confronting the Court\n1964 \nwas whether the Civil Rights Act of  could be\nregarded as \"[a] law providing for . . . equal civil\nrights\" within the meaning of the removal statute,\n1964 \nsince the Civil Rights Act of  was enacted\nsubsequent to the time when the phrase \"any law\nproviding for equal civil rights\" was added to\n5/\nthe removal statute. The Supreme Court held that\n1964 \nthe Civil Rights Act of  is encompassed within\nthat removal statute, stating:\n5/ \nThe original removal provision was contained in\n1866. \nthe Civil Rights Act of  The language \"any\nlaw providing for . . . equal civil rights\" first\n1874 \nappeared in  when the Revised Statutes were\n384 U.S.,  788.\ncompiled. See  at \n- 15 -\n\n• . . Congress' choice of the open-ended\nphrase \"any law providing for . . • equal\ncivil rights\" was clearly appropriate to\npermit removal in cases involving \"a right\nunder\" both existing and future statutes\nthat provided for equal civil rights.\n(384 U.S., at 789.)\nThe general open-ended phrase of §603 similarly\nincludes statutory review procedures existing on\nthe date of enactment of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964+, and those enacted thereafter.\nNot only is the Alabama Department's attempt\nto limit the language of §603 without basis in the\nlegislative history, but it is inconsistent with\none of the basic Congressional purposes for enacting\nTitle VI. The practical result of the State's\nconstruction of the language of §603 would mean that\nif the judicial review provisions of a federal grant\nstatute subsequently enacted are to be within the\nreach of §603, it would be necessary for Congress\nto insert an explicit reference to \"discrimination\nunder the Civil Rights Act.\" (See, Supplemental\nMemorandum, p. 15.) This would run counter to one\nof the basic purposes of Title VI - that of avoiding\nthe need to consider the matter of nondiscrimination\n- 16 -\n\neach time a bill providing for federal aid came\nunder consideration. Senator Pastore explained\nthis as follows (110 Cong. Rec. 7061):\nTitle VI would avoid the recurrence of\nacrimonious debate in the Congress as to\ndiscrimination in discussing individual\nFederal aid programs.\nTime and time again such proposed legis-\nlation has come before this body. Amendments\nhave been sponsored to make clear in a\nparticular program that separate but equal\nprovisions would not do.\nIt is to avoid such a situation that\nTitle VI would constitute as permanent\npolicy of the U.S. Government the principle\nthat discrimination will not be tolerated.\nThis would eliminate all the confusion\nand discussion that arise every time a\ngrant bill comes before the Senate.\nIt is clear that Title VI was intended to\napply to programs established in the future as well\nas to those which were in effect in 1964, and, by\nthe same token, there is no reason to distinguish\nbetween specific statutory judicial review provisions\ncreated after July 2, 1964 and those created before.\nWe conclude therefore that, because of the existence\nof 42 U.S.C. §1316, the Court of Appeals is the\nproper forum for review of the order of Secretary.\n- 17 -\n\nCONCLUSION\nAs the State has said in both its briefs,\n\"In any event, the entire case is now before this\nCourt.\" (Supplemeiital Memorandum, p. 18; original\nbrief, p. )45.)

WEAVER,\nUnited States Attorney,\nD. ROBERT OWEN,\nOWEN M. FISS,\nDAVID B. MARBLESTONE,\nAttorneys,\nDepartment of Justice,\nWashington, D. C. 20530\n\nWe submit this memorandum in response to the\nSupplemental Memorandum of the State of Alabama\n1967. \ndated June 20,  In this memorandum, we deal\nonly with the arguments raised by the State concerning\nthe jurisdictional question before this Court, and we\nrely on oral presentation and on our original brief,\n56-66 \nespecially on the discussion on pages  therein, to\ndeal with the question of the responsibility of the\nAlabama Department with respect to third parties, an\nissue discussed in the section in the State's Supplemental\nMemorandum entitled \"Brief Comments Relating to that\nwhich Transpired During the Oral Argument.\"\n1. The Inadequacy of the Specified Statutory\nRemedy.\nWe have maintained that the exclusive forum\nfor judicial review of the Secretary's order terminating\nassistance to the Alabama Department is that prescribed\nin the Social Security Act for similar action taken\nby the Secretary on other grounds - the Court of\nAppeals. The State has contended, however, that this\nspecific statutory remedy is \"inadequate,\" and that\ntherefore under established principles and the\nAdministrative Procedure Act review could be had in\nthe District Court. We have consistently recognized\n\nthe right of the Alabama Department to seek review of\nadministrative action in the District Court wherever\nthe remedy provided by special review provisions is\n\"inadequate;\" but we reject the contention that the\nspecific statutory remedy of the Social Security\nAct - direct judicial review by the Court of Appeals -\nis in this instance \"inadequate.\" Thus, the principal\nissue that divides us on the jurisdictional question\nis simply: Would direct judicial review by this\nCourt of Appeals of the Secretary's order terminating\nfederal financial assistance be inadequate?\nWe believe that judicial review of the\nSecretary's order by the Court of Appeals is entirely\nadequate. A petition for review in the Court of\nAppeals affords the State an effective remedy - an\nadjudication of the legality of the HEW regulation\nunderlying the Secretary's termination order.\nIn its Supplemental Memorandum the Alabama\nDepartment finds a \"potential analogy\" to support\nits contention that the remedy in this Court is\ninadequate in the recent decisions of the Supreme\nCourt in Toilet Goods Association v. Gardner,\n- 2 -\n\nAbbott Laboratories v. Gardner and Gardner v. Toilet\nGoods Association, 35 U.S. Law Week 424.31, 4433, and\n4439 (May 22, 1967). As we understand the Memorandum,\nthe State relies on those cases only insofar as they\nlend support to the following proposition:\nIf the Secretary is correct in stating that\nhe had no authority to strike down his regula-\ntion or requirement, then the administrative\nproceeding was palpably inadequate for deciding\nthe issue, and such inadequacy, in our opinion,\nwould be transferred to any specific statutory\nprovision for a review of the Secretary's\ndecision in a Court of Appeals. (Supplemental\nMemorandum, p. 8).\nHowever, we do not read the recent Supreme Court\ndecisions as lending any support to such a proposition.\nIndeed, as we read those cases, they reject that\nproposition, which, as a practical matter would permit\na party to avoid a specific statutory review procedure\n(such as those vesting the Court of Appeals with\nexclusive jurisdiction) whenever the party sought a\nlegal determination of the validity of the regulation\nunderlying the administrative action, and the adminis-\ntrative agency considered itself bound by one of its\nregulations.\n- 3 -\n\nIn the(cid:9) cases in question the Supreme Court\nrepeatedly recognized that the HEW regulations being\nchallenged did not fall within the enumerated\ncategories of regulations which were the subject of\nspecial statutory review procedures providing direct\nreview in the Court of Appeals. See Abbott\nLaboratories v. Gardner, 35 U.S. Law Week 4L33,\n4434 (May 22, 1967). See also footnote 4 and the\npertinent text in the dissenting opinion of\nMr. Justice Fortas. 35 U.S. Law Week at 4443.\nThe implication is that for regulations falling within\nthe statutory categories review would be had in\nthe statutorily designated forum, even if the\nvalidity of that regulation were being challenged,\nand without regard to whether the administrator\nwould consider the merits of a claim that the\nregulation was invalid. Thin, we believe, is\ninconsistent with the proposition the State now\nurges on this Court.\n\nThe proposition put forward by the State was\nmore explicitly rejected in one of those cases, Toilet\nGoods Association v. Gardner, 35 U.S. Law Week 4431,\ninvolving the \"access\" regulation of HEW, which requires\ndrug firms to grant access to certain manufacturing\nfacilities and records at the threat of suspension of\nFDA certification. Parties subject to the regulation\nchallenged its validity by commencing a civil action in\nthe District Court without having first exhausted the\nadministrative remedies, and the Supreme Court held\nthat such a pre-enforcement challenge was inappropriate.\nThe Court required the parties to go through the\nadministrative process and then seek judicial review\nin the statutorily prescribed forum - even though, as\nthe Court explicitly acknowledged, it was entirely\npossible \"that the Commissioner will not entertain\nand consider a challenge to his statutory authority\nto promulgate the regulation.\" 35 U.S. Law Week at\n4433. The Court noted that review of the Commission's\ndecision might be in either the District Court or the\nCourt of Appeals. 35 U.S. Law Week at 4432, footnote 3.\nBut it was clear that the Court was of the view that\n- 5 -\n\nthe choice of forum would turn on the construction\nof the special review provisions. The decision as to\nwhich forum was proper would be based upon a determination.\nof whether the particular administrative action in\nquestion (suspension by the Commissioner for refusal\nof access) was encompassed in the special review\nprovisions, and not on whether the party challenged\nthe validity of the regulation or whether the Commissioner\npassed on the merits of that claim.\nMore generally, it could be said of the cases\ndiscussed in the State's Supplemental Memorandum\nthat they are not at all addressed to the issue now\nbefore this Court - whether review by the specially\ndesignated forum is \"inadequate\" within the meaning\nof the Administrative Procedure Act. Instead, the\nSupreme Court was there concerned with an entirely\ndifferent issue - under what circumstances could a\njudicial determination of the validity of an\nadministrative regulation be had prior to any enforce-\nment action by the agency. The Court held that\nsuch a judicial determination could be had if Congress\ndid not prohibit it and if the challenge was \"ripe.\"\n-6-\n\nAnd it was solely in the limited context of deciding\nwhether the challenge was \"ripe\" that the Supreme\nCourt considered, as one of the relevant factors,\nwhether the party was challenging the statutory\nauthority for promulgating the regulation. The Court\ntook the view that such a challenge might be more\nsuspectible of judicial resolution in a pre-enforcement\ninjunctive action than in a suit whereby the party was\nchallenging a threatened application of the regulation.\nWe do not believe that any useful purpose would\nbe served by having this Court seek to determine\nwhether the State could have maintained a pre-enforcement\nchallenge to this regulation or whether (like the\naccess regulation challenged in Toilet Goods Association\nv. Gardner) the\"judicial appraisal\" of the statutory\npurpose, of the meaning and scope of the regulation,\nand of the enforcement problems of the agency \"is\nlikely to stand on a much surer footing in the context\nof a specific application of this regulation.\" 35 U.S.\nLaw Week at 4432. The fact of the matter is that this\n- 7 -\n\nl/\nis not a pre-enforcement suit.(cid:9) The administrative\nremedies have been exhausted, and this Court has before\nit a specific application of the regulation, the\nadministrative interpretation of the regulation, and\nthe administrative decision. It follows that the\nrecent Supreme Court decisions discussed in the State's\nSupplemental Memorandum have little relevance to the\njurisdictional question before this Court or, more\nspecifically, to the question whether the remedy\nprovided in the Social Security Act (direct review\nin the Court of Appeals) is adequate.\n6, 1965, \nl ,\" On May  Commissioner Ruben K. King sent\nto Dr. Ellen Winston a telegram which stated the\nfollowing: \"State Board of Pensions and Security\nin session today authorized a suit to contest\nvalidity of regulations promulgated by . . .[HEW]\n170,\nunder Title VI of Civil Rights Act.\" (See p. \nVolume I, Appendix to Brief of Secretary Gardner.)\nThis telegram was sent prior to the commencement\nby Dr. Winston of administrative proceedings for\ntermination of the federal grants.\nAfter the sending of the telegram, further\n29,\nnegotiations took place. However, on September \n1965, \nCommissioner King sent Dr. King a telegram\nwith the following message: \"State Board . . .\ntoday reaffirmed authorization for testing validity\nof rules and regulations promulgated by . . .. HEW\n179, \nunder Title VI . . . .\" (See p.  Volume I of\nAppendix.)\nNonetheless, the State Department did not bring\nits action in the district court until after administrative\nproceedings had been completed and Secretary Gardner had\napproved the decision to terminate the federal assistance.\n8 -\n- \n\nWe have thus far discussed the question of the\nadequacy of the statutorily prescribed remedy without\nregard to whether this Court has jurisdiction over\nthe order as it relates to all the programs or whether\nit has jurisdiction only over some - for the State's\nargument based on the recent Supreme Court decisions\ndoes not make that consideration relevant. However,\nanother of the State's arguments, which was made in\nits original brief and which has been renewed in the\n2/\nSupplemental Memorandum rests on the view that even\nif the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to review\nthe order as it relates to four programs (the public\nassistance programs - Titles I, IV, X and XIV), the\nDistrict Court would have exclusive jurisdiction to\nreview the order as it relates to the fifth program\n2/ The State, in its Supplemental Memorandum (pp. 16-17),\nseeks to support its contention as to the inadequacy of\nthe Court of Appeals direct review remedy by noting\nthat it sought to add private individuals as plaintiffs\nin the district court suit. The State asserts that\n\"whatever rights they [the private individuals] have\nmay be relevant to . . . the question of jurisdiction.\"\nRegarding this contention, we rely upon the\ndiscussion in footnote 11 on page 34 of our original\nbrief.\n-9-\n\n(child welfare services - Title V (Part 3)). The\nState contends that this limitation on the scope of\nthe jurisdiction of this Court renders the remedy\nhere \"inadequate.\"\nWe reject the view that only the District\nCourt has jurisdiction to review the Secretary's\norder as it relates to the child welfare services\n38-44 \n(see pp.  of our original brief). But we also\nmaintain that, even on the State's view that the\nSecretary's Order as it relates to the child welfare\nservices program is reviewable only in the District\nCourt, the statutorily prescribed remedy of direct\nreview in the Court of Appeals of the order as it\nrelates to the other programs is nevertheless adequate.\nThe legal question as to the validity of the order\nis the same regardless of which program it relates to.\nWhatever the Court of Appeals decides as to the\nvalidity of the Secretary's order as it pertains to\nTitles I, IV, X and XIV will control the decision\nas to the validity of the Secretary's order as it\n3) \nrelates to Title V (Part  as well. As a practical\nmatter, if the District Court took jurisdiction over\n- 10 -\n\nthe order as it relates to Title V (Part 3), it would\nin all probability hold proceedings in abeyance until\nthe Court of Appeals adjudicated the validity of the\norder as it related to the other four programs. The\nright of the Alabama Department to a judicial deter-\nmination of validity would be protected, and scarce\njudicial resources would be conserved.\nIn response to this line of argument, the State,\nin its original brief, drew on certain language in\nHillsborough v. Cromwell, 326 U.S. 620 (i9Li6) to the\neffect that a remedy was inadequate unless it \"covered\nthe entire case.\" The State asserts that the statement\nwas made in an \"analogous context.\" However, we\ndisagree. As pointed out during oral argument, the\nSupreme Court's statement was made in the context\nof rejecting a position that would have required the\nplaintiff to proceed in both a state court (for an\nadjudication of the state claim) and a federal court\n(for an adjudication of the federal claim) . Unlike\nour case, where the two forums are part of the same\njudicial system and there is a right to appeal the\ndecision of one forum to the other, the Court in\n- 11 -\n\nHillsborough addressed itself to a situation where\na decision in one forum would not necessarily dispose\nof the issue in the other forum and the party might be\nforced to actively litigate in two courts before he\nobtained any relief. In that instance, the Supreme\nCourt broadened the scope of the federal court remedy\nto permit it to reach the state claim, thus making the\nfederal court remedy adequate.\n2. The Meaning of §603.\nThe Alabama Department's principal contention\nwith respect to the jurisdictional question has been\nthat the specific statutory review procedures, vesting\nexclusive jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals, are\n\"inadequate.\" However, in its Supplemental Memorandum\na new argument is put forward viz., that the critical\nlanguage of §603 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\nstating that agency action terminating assistance for\nnoncompliance with the requirements of that Act \"shall\nbe subject to such judicial review as may otherwise\nbe provided by law for similar action taken by such\ndepartment . . . on other grounds,\" does not include\nthe review provisions under the Social Security Act,\n- 12 -\n\n42 U.S.C. §1316. The claim is that this language\nof §603 refers only to special statutory review\nprovisions which were in existence at the time of\nthe enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n(July 2, 1964), not to review provisions such as\nthose in the Social Security Act which were adopted\nsubsequently (July 30, 1965).\nThere is no basis in the statutory language\nor the legislative history for such a limited\ninterpretation of §603. The statute uses the phrase\n\"provided by law,\" and not \"provided by law at the\ntime of the enactment of this Act;\" and similarly\nthe phrase used in the legislative debates and\nquoted in the Alabama Department's Supplemental\n3/\nMemorandum is \"existing law,\" not \"law existing at\n3/ The statement quoted on page 13 of the Alabama\nDepartment's Supplemental Memorandum is that of Senator\nPastore, 110 Cong. Rec. 6842 (daily ed., April 7, 1964);\n110 Cong. Sec. 7060-61 (permanent ed.). Just prior to\nthe statement quoted, Senator Pastore said:\nAdditional safeguards against arbitrary\naction are provided in section 603. Under\nthat section any agency action taken pursuant\nto section 602 would be subject to judicial\nreview to the extent and in the manner provided\nby existing law applicable to similar action\ntaken by the agency on other grounds. Thus,\nwhere special statutory review procedures are\navailable under certain statutes, those\nprocedures should be followed.\n- 13 -\n\nthe time of the enactment of this Act.\" Standard\nprinciples of statutory construction require that\nthe general, open-ended language used in §603 be\nread to include both the statutory review provisions\nexisting at the time of the enactment of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, and those that come into. existence\n4/\nafter enactment.(cid:9) See generally, 2 Sutherland,\nStatutory Construction §5102 (1943); Browder v. United\nStates, 312 U.S. 335, 339 (1941). This principle of\nstatutory construction was recently recognized by the\nSupreme Court in Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U.S. 780 (1966).\n4/ It appears that, under the Alabama Department's\ntheory, §603 would apply neither to special review\nprovisions in acts adopted after July 2, 1964, nor\nto review provisions which were in effect in July, 1964,\nbut were amended thereafter. This would mean, for\nexample, that if Congress were to amend the judicial\nreview provision of the Hill-Burton Act, 42 U.S.C.\n§291(h), to provide that review could take place\nonly in the Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia Circuit (as opposed to the court of appeals\nfor the circuit where the state seeking Hill-Burton\nfunds is located), the amended provision would not be\na special review provision within the meaning of §603,\nsince the amended provision would go into effect after\nJuly 2, 1964.\n- 14 -\n\nIn Georgia v. Rachel, the Supreme Court was\ncalled upon to construe a Reconstruction statute\nwhich provided for the removal to federal district\ncourts of actions \"against any person who is denied\nor cannot enforce in the court of [a] State a right\nunder any law providing for the equal civil rights\nof citizens of the United States . . . .\" See\n28 U.S.C. §1443(1). \nOne issue confronting the Court\n1964 \nwas whether the Civil Rights Act of  could be\nregarded as \"[a] law providing for . . . equal civil\nrights\" within the meaning of the removal statute,\n1964 \nsince the Civil Rights Act of  was enacted\nsubsequent to the time when the phrase \"any law\nproviding for equal civil rights\" was added to\n5/\nthe removal statute. The Supreme Court held that\n1964 \nthe Civil Rights Act of  is encompassed within\nthat removal statute, stating:\n5/ \nThe original removal provision was contained in\n1866. \nthe Civil Rights Act of  The language \"any\nlaw providing for . . . equal civil rights\" first\n1874 \nappeared in  when the Revised Statutes were\n384 U.S.,  788.\ncompiled. See  at \n- 15 -\n\n• . . Congress' choice of the open-ended\nphrase \"any law providing for . . • equal\ncivil rights\" was clearly appropriate to\npermit removal in cases involving \"a right\nunder\" both existing and future statutes\nthat provided for equal civil rights.\n(384 U.S., at 789.)\nThe general open-ended phrase of §603 similarly\nincludes statutory review procedures existing on\nthe date of enactment of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964+, and those enacted thereafter.\nNot only is the Alabama Department's attempt\nto limit the language of §603 without basis in the\nlegislative history, but it is inconsistent with\none of the basic Congressional purposes for enacting\nTitle VI. The practical result of the State's\nconstruction of the language of §603 would mean that\nif the judicial review provisions of a federal grant\nstatute subsequently enacted are to be within the\nreach of §603, it would be necessary for Congress\nto insert an explicit reference to \"discrimination\nunder the Civil Rights Act.\" (See, Supplemental\nMemorandum, p. 15.) This would run counter to one\nof the basic purposes of Title VI - that of avoiding\nthe need to consider the matter of nondiscrimination\n- 16 -\n\neach time a bill providing for federal aid came\nunder consideration. Senator Pastore explained\nthis as follows (110 Cong. Rec. 7061):\nTitle VI would avoid the recurrence of\nacrimonious debate in the Congress as to\ndiscrimination in discussing individual\nFederal aid programs.\nTime and time again such proposed legis-\nlation has come before this body. Amendments\nhave been sponsored to make clear in a\nparticular program that separate but equal\nprovisions would not do.\nIt is to avoid such a situation that\nTitle VI would constitute as permanent\npolicy of the U.S. Government the principle\nthat discrimination will not be tolerated.\nThis would eliminate all the confusion\nand discussion that arise every time a\ngrant bill comes before the Senate.\nIt is clear that Title VI was intended to\napply to programs established in the future as well\nas to those which were in effect in 1964, and, by\nthe same token, there is no reason to distinguish\nbetween specific statutory judicial review provisions\ncreated after July 2, 1964 and those created before.\nWe conclude therefore that, because of the existence\nof 42 U.S.C. §1316, the Court of Appeals is the\nproper forum for review of the order of Secretary.\n- 17 -\n\nCONCLUSION\nAs the State has said in both its briefs,\n\"In any event, the entire case is now before this\nCourt.\" (Supplemeiital Memorandum, p. 18; original\nbrief, p. )45.) We urge this court to decide the\nsubstantive issues on the alternative petition for\nreview rather than on the appeal from the preliminary\ninjunction.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJOHN DOAR,\nAssistant Attorney General,\nMACON L.

At the end of the con-\nversation she stated that she had given Mr. Barnes a\n\n- 3\ncopy of the statement of compliance and advised\nto inquire of Mr. Barnes whether he would start\nnegotiating the terms of the statement or compliance\nso that it can be expeditiously filed when and if\ncertiorari is denied.\n\ne \n1SE\nThe Files September 26, 1967\nOMF:jpw\nDJ 171-1-3\nOwen M. Piss\nSpecial Assistant\nCivil Rights Division\nAlabama v. Gardner -- Stay of the\nMaedate of the Court of Appeals \nOn September 21, 1967 I telephoned Mr. Reid\nBarnes to learn whether the State was intending to\nsubmit a statement of compliance. he then, advised\nme that the State had applied to Judge Gewin a short\nwhile ago for a stay of its mandate in order to\npermit the State to apply for certiorari. Immediately\nafter finishing my telephone conversation with\nMr. Barnes I spoke to Ed Yourmaa of hEW. he told me\nthat he had lust spoken to Miss Mary Lee Stapp of the\nState Attorney General's office, and she said that\nshe had applied for a stay on behalf of the State a\nshort while ago.\nAfter consulting with Mr. Owen, I telephoned\nJudge Gewin's secretary. I stated that I was the\nattorney for the Government in this case and I wished\nCo be heard on the application for a stay. She\nimmediately said that she was very familiar with the\ncase and that Judge Gewin would want to speak to rue\nabout it. I was then connected to Judge Gewin and I\nidentified myself. I said the purpose of this call\nwas solely to advise him that the Government wished\nto be heard and that we have not yet been served with\nthe papers. He then said that he had consulted with\njudges about this matter and he was inclined to rule\non the application for a stay in the immediate future.\nHe, therefore, said that the Government could only be\nheard in the course of this telephone conversation\nand he asked me to express the views of the Government.\nHe then read the papers that had been submitted by the\nState and I responded as follows:\ncc: Chrono\nOwen\nRose\nFiss\nMrs. Rosenberg\n\nThe Government opposed the application for\nthe stay because we believed that the State could\nfile the statement of compliance within the re-\nmaining 10 days without compromising any of its\nrights to have the Supreme Court review the issues.\nI also pointed out that more than 20 days had\nlapsed since the issuance of the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals in this case and that the State\nhas taken no action to brine itself into compliance\nor to prepare a petition for certiorari even though\nHEW offered assistance in preparing the statement of\ncompliance. Finally, I urged that the denial of the\nState by this Court would nevertheless leave the\nState free to apply to a Justice of the Supreme Court\nfor a stay. I expressed the view that such a pro-\ncedure would be preferable since the Justice would\nget the feeling of conference as to whether there was\nany prospect of granting certiorari. At various\npoints throughout the conversation I stated I was\nextremely reluctant to express these views in the\nabsence of counsel for the other side; but the Judge\ninsisted that this was the only opportunity to have\nthese views expressed and he very much wanted to hear\nwhat the Government's position was. Throughout the\nconversation he emphasized the importance ofgiving\nthe State an opportunity to have the matter finally\nadjudicated without causing undo alarm or anxiety in\nthe real parties in interest -- to the welfare\nrecipients. On the basis of these remarks, in my\njudgment, it appeared that he was inclined to grant\nthe stay.\nOn about 11:00 on Friday, September 22, I\ntelephoned Miss Stapp to inquire as to whether the\nJudge ruled on the stay. She said that the Judge had\nentered a ruling that morning granting the stay. She\nwas unclear as to the precise terms of the stay, but\nthought it gave them within 30 days in which to file\nthe petition for certiorari. At the end of the con-\nversation she stated that she had given Mr. Barnes a\n\n- 3\ncopy of the statement of compliance and advised\nto inquire of Mr. Barnes whether he would start\nnegotiating the terms of the statement or compliance\nso that it can be expeditiously filed when and if\ncertiorari is denied.",
