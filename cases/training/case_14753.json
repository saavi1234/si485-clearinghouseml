    "summary": "<p>This case is part of the Clearinghouse Special Collection on the events and litigation leading up to and surrounding the famous Selma-to-Montgomery marches of 1965.  </p><p>This suit was filed on 9/2/1964. Prior to this suit, Judge Albert Hare of Alabama's state court for Dallas County (where Selma is located), issued an injunction on July 9, 1964 effectively making it unlawful to conduct large public protests or gather to discuss and plan civil rights activism. Specifically, the injunction made the following activities unlawful: (1) assembly of three or more people in a public place for the purposes of discussing \"violation of law\" or that otherwise impaired use of roads, (2) meetings or activities intended to impede or obstruct \"the administration of justice or the orderly function of government,\" (3) activities intended to impede law enforcement officials from exercising their duties, and (4) conduct otherwise against law enforcement officers. The injunction thus made it difficult for civil rights activists and organizations to continue to conduct their activities in Selma. The injunction was ultimately dissolved on April 16, 1965 in <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16546\">Dallas County v. Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee</a>.</p><p>Tension in Selma over racial discrimination and voting rights continued to rise throughout early 1965, ultimately precipitating the Selma-to-Montgomery protests in March 1965. A major source of the tension was the fact that Sheriff James Clark allowed his \"possemen\" to handle all race-related matters in Selma. Sheriff Clark was famous for his support of segregation and resort to violence in opposing the civil rights movement. The possemen were several hundred nonprofessional individuals reporting to Sheriff Clark charged with responding to emergency and disaster. These men carried guns and clubs, and sometimes gas canisters. The Sheriff and his possemen beat, arrested, and jailed black individuals on various occasions under dubious justifications. Other times, they simply failed to protect black individuals from the conduct of other civilians.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Department of Justice filed this suit on September 2, 1964 pursuant to the Civil Rights Act. The DOJ sued Dallas County, the City of Selma, and their officials, including Sheriff James Clark and Judge Hare. The DOJ argued that the defendants violated the Civil Rights Act by conducting activities intended to threaten, intimidate, and coerce black citizens in order to deprive them of the right to register to vote and to use public accommodations. Activities ranged from mass arrests in connection with voting rights demonstrations to harassment of black individuals attempting to use public spaces like theaters and restaurants. The Civil Rights Act explicitly prohibited such interference with the right to vote and the right to use public accommodations. Accordingly, the DOJ sought to enjoin the defendants from these practices. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama. </p><p>The defendants moved to dismiss the case. After a hearing, the court (per curiam) granted injunctive relief and denied the motion to dismiss on April 16, 1965 (249 F. Supp. 720). The court held that \"[t]he law is clear that there can be no coercion or punishment of any person for the purpose of interfering with the right to nondiscriminatory treatment in a place of public accommodation or in the right to vote in Federal elections.\"</p><p>The court found that in Dallas County where Selma is located, as well as several other Alabama counties, less than 10% of the black voting age population was registered to vote. The court noted that in response, black communities organized and attempted to gain better political representation through mass meetings, demonstrations, and picketing. But the Sheriff's office stymied these efforts by attending activists' meetings and conducting mass arrests. More information about this conduct can be found <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16526\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14900\">here</a>. Black activists' efforts were further hindered by Judge Hare's injunction that was since dissolved. Moreover, the court found multiple instances of Sheriff Clark and his possemen either preventing black individuals from using public accommodations or failing to protect their right to do so when civilians so interfered. The court held that \"the effect of [these] baseless arrests, unjustified prosecutions, unwarranted and illegal injunctions, and any other acts or conduct...upon individuals so subjected who are legally seeking to exercise their rights...is to severely discourage, intimidate, threaten and coerce those citizens\" from exercising those rights. The court held this conduct was a direct violation of the Civil Rights Act. </p><p>The court attributed this illegal conduct to the Sheriff's office and its agents and Sheriff Clark himself, but it denied holding the state court defendants liable in the interest of comity. The court also did not hold the City of Selma liable, finding that although it had allowed the Sheriff's agents to handle race-related matters in Selma, it did not unlawfully abdicate its responsibilities. The court gave the City the benefit of the doubt that it would refrain from unlawful interference of rights, while reserving jurisdiction over it and these issues.</p><p>Although the court did not enjoin the state court defendants, it did deny their judicial immunity defense. The court found that judicial immunity applies only when such officials are dealing with civil suits for damages arising from their official duties. Since the DOJ was seeking preventative relief as to future conduct, the court held that immunity did not apply. Any injunction issued by this court \"will only prevent the doing of what there is no right to do.\"</p><p>Ultimately, the court issued an injunction against Sheriff Clark, his deputies, and his possemen \"prohibit[ing] coercion, punishment, intimidation or harassment of Negroes or others acting with them in their exercise or attempts to exercise their constitutional rights.\" The court further enjoined the Sheriff's office from using the possemen in connection with any race-related issues. </p><p>The case is long-since closed. We have limited access to case records and information, and we will update this page if more become available.</p>",

Each  entry  is  supported \nby  evidence  as  indicated  in  parentheses. \nH-1 \n\nJuly 4 \n12:00  noon  William Suther  of  the  mounted  posse  was \ncalled to duty.  (Test~ony of \nSuther) \n12:33  p.m.  City Police  car No.  22  reported:  \"about \n12 Negroes  by '\\tJilby.\"  (Pl.  Ex.  13C) \n12:54 p.m.  County  Sheriff's car No.  D-5  was  instructed \nto go  to  the Wilby Theater.  A  few  minutes \nlater,  D-5  stopped at  the  Hilby.  (Pl.Ex.  29G) \n1:00 p.m.  William Suther  arrived at  the  \\.Jilby Theater \nin a  county car.  He  stayed  at  the  theater \nfor  one  or  two  hours.  Other members  of \nthe  posse  were  also at  the  theater. \n(Testimony of  Suther) \n1:45  p.m.  Dorothy Oliver,  a  cashier at  the Wilby \nTheater,  opened  the  theater  about  1:45. \nThere  was  a  large  crowd  of  Negroes  and \nwhite  persons  outside,  including more \nNegroes  than whites.  The  crowd had  formed \norderly lines  at  the  Negro  and  white  ticket \nwindows.  The  second balcony,  vJhich  had \npreviously been  the  Negro  section,  filled \nabout  an hour  after the  opening  of  the \ntheater.  After  that,  most  of  the  persons \nwaiting were  Negro  youngsters.  No  Negroes \ntried to  buy  tickets  for  the  white  section \nuntil  later i.n  the  afternoon.  (Testimony  of \nยทButler and Oliver). \n\n2:03  p.m.  A State Trooper  radio  call  reported  that \nunits  572  (Head)  and  Dl  (Clark)  were  at \nthe  courthouse.  (Pl.  Ex.  31C;  set~  Table  I.) \n3:00-3:30  p.m.  James  Wiley,  Carol  Lawson,  Silas  Norman, \nand  Karen House,  all Negroes,  drove  into \nthe  parking  lot  of  the  Thirsty Boy  Drive \nIn to have  lunch.  Hhen  they got  out  of \ntheir car,  John Warren,  the  operator of  the \ndrive-in,  met  the  group  in the  parking lot \nand  told  them,  \"You might  as  well  go  away, \nthis  is  private  property.\"  The  group  drove \naway,  and ~..J'arren  called the  Sheriff and \nasked him  to  come.  (Testimony of \n~1iley, \nHouse,  Latvson,  Norman,  and Harren). \n3:16  p.m.  County  Sheriff's  car  D-5  was  dispatched  to \nthe  Thirsty Boy.  (Pl.  Ex.  29G) \n3:17  County car D-1  (Sheriff Clark)  was  dispatched \nto  the  Thirsty Boy..  (Pl.  Ex.  29G) \n3:00-3:30p.m.  l1eanwhile,  the  group  of  four  Negroes  parked \n( cont 'd) \ntheir car  on  Broad  Street  and  't-Jalked  across \nBroad  Street  and  into  the Thirsty Boy.  They \ntook  seats  at  a  table  in the  middle  of the \ndining  area.  There  were  several  persons \npresent,  but  no  one  said  anything  to  the \ngroup  of  Negroes.  lโขJiley noticed  a  self-ser \nvice  sign and  told Norman  that  they had  to \norder.  Norman  went  to  the  counter by  the \nlarge  service windov-1.  A waitresEI  went  into \nH-3 \n\nthe  back room.  Warren  was  behind the \nJUL  4 \nservice  window.  He  asked  the  Negroes  to \nleave,  in a  low  voice  and mostly by motion. \nlo\\1iley  did not  hear Harren tell  the Negroes \nto leave.  (Testimony of Hiley and \nWarren)  Deputy  Sheriff Hewston  arrived \n,. \nat  the Thirsty Boy  shortly after 3:16,  and \nSheriff Clark  arrived a  few  minutes  later \nwith  State  Investigator Head.  Deputy \nHe~ITston, \nDeputy  Bates,  and  Sheriff Clark went  inside \n11 \nthe Thirsty Boy. Harren  told Hewston  that \nthere  were  people  there  he  would  like  to \nremove.  Hewston  told  lยทJarren  that  he  would \nhave  to  sign warrants.  Sheriff Clark went \nto  the  small  window  through which  trays  are \npassed  and  said  to  r,rarren,  \"You  want  them \nall  arrested,  don't  you?\"  Warren  replied, \n\"No,  I  just want  them out  of  here.\"  The \nSheriff  repeated  his  question,  after which \nWarren was  given  the  warrants,  which he \nsigned.~ The  warrants which were  used had \n1/ Clark testified that  Hewston was  already  there when  he  ar \nrived with Head  in the  car.  Most  probably Hewston  arrived in \ncar  D-5,  which was  dispatched  to  the  Thirsty Boy  at  3:16  p.m. \nand Clark arrived in car  D-1,  which was  dispatched  at  3:17  p.m. \nHe~Jston testified that Clark was  \"with\" him,  which  probably \nmeant  that Clark went  inside  the  restaurant  with him  or closely \nbehind him,  not  that Clark arrived  in the  same  car with him.  ยท \n2/ Clark  testified that Harren was  already signing  the  papers \nWhen  he  arrived.  But  ,,Jiley testified that  he  thought  Clark \nasked Warren  twice  whether Warren  wanted  the  Negroes  arrested \nbefore Warren was  given the  papers.  Warren himself  testified \nthat he  signed  the  warrants  in the  presence  of  the  sheriff. \nRufus  Head  testified that he  saw Clark and Hewston  talking to \nthe  owner  of the  drive-in. \nH-4 \n\nbeen  given  to  Deputy  Hewston  to  carry with \nhim.  ~arlier in  the  day  the warrants  had \nbeen  partially filled out.  The  name  of  the \noffense  (Trespass  after Warning)  and  the \nelements  of  the  offense  had  been  typed  in. \n(Pl.  Ex.  4  and  5.  Hewston  testified that  the \nwarrants  had been  partially completed earlier \nin  the  day.  Clark  testified that the  charges \nhad been  typed  in  ahead  of  time.) \nAfter  the warrants were  signed,  the  Sheriff \napproached  the  group of  Negroes  seated at the \ntable  and  said,  \"All right,  let's go.\"  Each \nof  the  Negroes  was  jabbed with  a  cattle prod; \nthen  they were  escorted  into  a  car by  the \nSheriff.  Carol  Lawson  did not  hear  the word \n\"arrest\" until  they  were  toward  the  door. \n(Testimony of  Lawson)  Norman  was  jolted on \nthe  left arm  by Sheriff Clark on  the way  to \nthe  car.  Norman  was  jolted as  he  got  into \none  car,  he  was  jolted again  to  get him  out \nof  the  car,  and  he  was  jolted as  he  got  into \nanother  car.  At  one  point  Norman  attempted \nto  avoid being  jolted,  and  Clark asked,  \"Are \nyou  trying  to  kick me?\"  (Testimony of Norman) \n3:25-3:30  The  four Negroes  were  driven  to  the  county \njail and  booked.  (Pl.  Ex.  29C)Y ltJhile  Wiley \n2/ \nThe  Booking  Sheets  for  the  four Negroes  indicate  that  they \nwere  arrested between  3:05  p.m.  and  3:15  p.m.  In  view of  the \nfact  thaยทt ยทthe  county cars  were  not .dispatched  to  the  Thirsty \nBoy  until 3:16  and  3:17  p.m.,  it is  likely that  the  times  of \narrest were  estimated roughly  after the  prisoners were  brought \nto  the  jail. \nH-5 \n\nJUt  4  'if \nand  Norman  were  being  fingerprinted,  Clark \nasked  each of  them  twice  whether  he  was  the \none  who  had  tried to  kick Clark. \n3:00-3:30  p.m.  Across  the  street  from  the  Wilby Theater,  a \nsmall  teen-age  Negro  and  a  large white  man \nswung  at  each  other.  A large Negro  man \nwent  over  from  the  T~ilby.  Roger  Butler, \nthe manager  of the  theater,  telephoned  the \npolice.  A police  car arrived within a  few \nminutes,  but  the  situation had  ironed  it \nself out  in the meantime.  (Testimony  of \nButler) \n4:00-5:30  p.m.  Negroes  ยทoegan  buying  tickets  for  the  white \nsection of  the Wilby Theater.  Approximately \n15-20 !ยทlegroes  bought  tickets,  entered \nthrou6h  the  white  entrance,  and  selected \n41 \nseats  in the  white  section. When  the  Negroes \nentered  the  white  section,  four  to  six white \n4/  Butler  testified that no  Negro  tried to  buy  a  ticket \n~or the  white  section until  about  5:30.  Mrs.  Oliver,  the \ncashier,  says  she  sold  the  first  ticket  to Negroes  for  the \nsection about  4:00.  Nilton Hopkins  testified that  he \n\"t~hite \narrived at  the  theater  about  2:30  p.m.  or 3  p.m.  and  took  a \nseat  in the white  section.  However,  Hopkins  probably arrived \ncloser  to  5:00  or  5:15  p .โข m.  since  he  testified that he  watched \nthe movie  for  about  45  minutes  before Mr.  Butler warned  the \nNegroes  in the  theater  about  the  crowd  of whites  outside. \nMr.  Butler's warning,  as  appears  infra,  was  not  given until \nafter 6:00  p.mw  It  is possible  that Mrs.  Oliver  sold Negroes \ntickets  for  the  white  section around 4:00  p.m.  but  that \nButler did not  notice  the  Negroes  buy  their tickets  and  thought \nthat  the  group  of Negroes  buying  tickets  about  5:30  p.m.  was \nthe  first  group  to buy  tickets.  In any  event,  some  Negroes \nmust  have  purchased  tickets  for  the  white  section prior to \n5:30,  since Nrs.  Oliver  remembers  selling tickets  for  the \nwhite  section to  Negroes  that  day  and  both  she  and  Mrs.  Moore \ntestified that  Mrs.  lยท1oore  relieved Mrs.  Oliver as  cashier at \n5:30. \nH-6 \n\nJUL  4  persons  left  the  theater,  cursing.  (Testi-\nmony  of Hopkins) \n5:00-6:00  p.m.  After Negroes  began entering  the  white  section \nof  the  \\.,Tilby  Theater,  a  small  crowd  of tvhite \npersons  formed  directly across  Selma Avenue \nfrom  the  entrance  to  the  theater  and  a  large \ncrowd  of white  persons  formed  on  the  south \neast  corner of Selma Avenue  and  Broad Street, \nin front  of Carter's Drug  Store.  (Testimony \nof  Butler and Head) \n5:15  p.m.  City Police Car  No.  99  was  advised  that  a \ngang  had  congregated  on  the  sidewalk near the \nr.,ralton  Theater. \n5:32-6:30  p.m.  City Police  cars  100  and  44  were  ordered  to \nstay uptown,  close  to  the  'ยทยทTi.lby  and  ยทnalton \nTheaters  (Pl.  13C).  The  Police cars \nEx~ \npatrolled slowly  past  the Wilby Theater. \n(Testimony of  Fuller,  Hopkins,  and Ben \nJackson) \n5:45-6:15  p.m.  Earnest  Harrell  walked up  to  the hTilby \nrtheater  and  saw  a  large  group  of Negroes \noutside.  He  asked  some  of his  friends  what \nwas  going  on,  and  he  was  told that  some \nNegroes  had  gone  into  the  white  section of \nthe  Wilby Theater.  Harrell  and  Joe \nSmitherman went  up  to  the  ticket windmv  for \nthe white  section and  bought  tickets. \nSmitherman entered  the  theater through  the \nwhite  entrance.  Harrell  started to  follow \nH-7 \n\nJlJl  4  Smitherman  into  the  theater when  he  was  met \nby a  white  man  who  asked,  are  you \n\"~.-Jh.ere \ngoing?\"  Harrell  answered,  \"I  bought  a \nticket  for  this  door.\"  The  white man  cursed., \nThe  Negro  crowd  began yelling.  Harrell \nmoved  toward  the white  entrance  and was \nagain blocked by  the  white man.  Harrell \nstepped back.  Heanwhile,  Hilliam Standberry \nhad bought  a  ticket.  Standberry asked  the \nwhite  man  if he  represented the management. \nThe  ~\"hite man  answered,  ''No. \"  Standberry \nsaid,  \"Then  you  have  no  right  to block.\" \nThen  some  other white  men  joined the man \nwho  was  blocking  the  entrance.  One  of  them \nhad  a  knife.  A Negro  in  the  crowd  said that \nhe  had  a  knife,  and  he  pulled  it out.  He \nt\"as  restrained by  some  Negroes  in the  crowd. \nHarrell went  to  the  ticket window  and  got \nhis money  back.  At  that  point  Harrell  noticed \nthat  three  or  four  uniformed officers were \npresent.  (Testimony  of  Harrell) \n'I'hen  two  more  groups  of  Negroes  arrived at \nthe Wilby.  One  party consisted of Ronald \nFuller,  Nathaniel  Harris,  Philip Hunter, \nJames  Bro~m, Godfrey Jones,  Bernard  Collins, \nand  Bernard Sims.  (Testimony  of \nFuller)  In  the  other group  were  Ben  Jackson, \nLeon  Sanders,  and  Hazel  Chapman.  (Testimony \nof Ben Jackson)  The  boys  in the  two  groups \nH-8 \n\n.nJL  4  stood  in  front  of  the  theater and  talked \nfor  about  five minutes,  then  started to \nbuy  tickets  for the  white  section.  Fuller \nbought  a  ticket and  started for the white \nentrance.  One  of  the white men  standing \nbetween  the  ticket window  and  the  door  said, \n\"Nigger,  don't go  in  there.\"  Fuller's \nparty hesitated.  Fuller continued toward \nthe  entrance,  and  one  of the white men  struck \nFuller on  the  jaw.  Fuller stepped back.  A \nNegro  said,  '~Jho  do  you  think youare?\" \nFuller's  assailant replied,  \"I '11  show  you \nwho  I  am,\"  and  he  pulled out  a  small  knife. \nFuller went  to  the  ticket window  and  had  his \nmoney  refunded.  (Testimony  of  Fuller) \nAt  some  point either shortly before  or \nshortly after  Fuller was  struck,  Sheriff \nClark drove  up  and  stopped his  car in  the \nmiddle  of  SelmaAvenue,  facing  east.  (Ben \nJackson  testified that Sheriff Clark had \narrived  and  was  in  position  to  see  Fuller \nbeing  struck;  Clark  testified that he  saw no \none  get hit and  saw no  weapons.)  Alvery \nWilliams,  a  Negro  SNCC  worker who  may  have \nbeen  urging  Negroes  to  enter the  white  section \n5/ \nof  the  theater,- went  out  toward  the  sheriff's \ncar and  said to  Clark,  \"Did you  see  that? \ntle' re  paying  taxes  lilre everyone  else.\" \n(Testimony  of  Fuller and  Ben  Jackson) \n2/ Sheriff Clark testified that he  watched t-Jilliams  move \namong  the  groups  of Negroes  in front  of  the  theater,  motion \ning  people  to  come  toward  him.  Williams  testified that he \ndid not  ask people  to  enter the  theater. \nH-9 \n\nHilliams  said he  wanted  the  white  men  who \nJUL  4 \nblocking  the  entrance  arrested.  ( Testi \n~Jere \nmony  of  Clark)\\  Clark  asked Hilliams, \n\"Do  you  want  to  swear  out  a  'tolarrant?\"  and \nreplied,  \"I  don't  have  to. \"  Then \n~Tilliams \nClark  said,  \"The  federal  government  passed \nthe  la'tv,  let  them  enforce  it.\"  (Testimony \nof  Ben  Jackson).  Then  a  Negro  in the  crowd \nshouted,  ''Let's  get  1 em. 11  (Testimony of \nHill  and Clark)  Clark  jumped \nout  of his  car  and  swung  his  night  stick at \na  Negro,  saying,  \"Get  the  hell  out  of here, \nyou  don't  belong here  anyway.\"  (Testimony  of \nFuller)  Clark  radioed  for  help \nbefore  he  got  out  of  the  car.  (Testimony  of \nClark)ยท  Hmveverยท,  the  Sheriff's  radio \nlog contains  no  entries  between  3:17  and \n9:03  p.m ..  (~1. Ex.  29G).  Officers  came  from \nall  directions and  began  swinging  their \nnightsticks.  (Testimony  of Hill) \nCity police  officers  arrived.  They  restrained \na  crowd  of t-.;voel ve  to  fifteen whites,  then \nhelped Sheriff Clark disperse  the  Negroes. \n(Testimony of Cecil  Goodvtin  and  Foster) \nThe  Sheriff's officers  swung  their night~ \nsticks  at  the  Negroes and  threw  their night \nsticks  at the  Negroes,  causing  them  to \nscatter  in  all  directions,  mostly  eastwยทard \non Selma Avenue.  (Testimony  of Ben  Jackson, \nH-10 \n\nFuller,  Hill,  and  Clark). \n6:00  p.m.  At  some  point  during  the  confrontation be-ยท \ntween  the  Negro  ticket-holders  and  the \nwhite  men  obstructing the  entrance  to  the \nlrlhite  section of  the  ~.Jilby Theater,  Roger \nButlert  manager  of  the  theater,  saw  a  Negro \nin the  crowd  brandishing a  bottle.  Butler \ninstructed his cashier to duck,  and he  tele \nphoned  the  police.  (Testimony of \nButler)  City Police  officers were  dispatched \nto  the  ~vilby.~./  By  6:02  car  22  had  arrived \nat  the  Hilby and  car ll was  on  its way  to \nthe 'Hilby.  (Pl.Ex.  13C) \n6:00-6:30  p.m.  After  the  Negroes  had  been dispersed  from  in \nfront  of the Hilby Theater,  Sheriff Clark \ntalked with  Butler,  then  left.  Shortly \nthereafter a  crowd  of  whites  formed  in front \nof  the  theater,  and  someone  hollered  that \nthere  were  \"niggers\"  in the  theater.  (Testi-\nmony  of  Butler)  Butler  talked \n'Iilith  the  white  crowd  and  asl~ed them  to  allow \nhim  to  talk with  the  Negroes  inside.  Butler \nexplained to  the  Negroes  in the  white  section \nthat  a  hostile white  crowd was  outside.  The \nNegroes  got  up  and  began  to  leave.  (Testimony \n6/ The  City records  indicate  that  Butler's call  was  received \nat  6:01  (~1.  Ex.  l3A)  and  that  cars  44  and  100  were  advised \nof a  complaint  by  Butler at 6:00  (Pl.  Ex.  13C).  Most_probably \nthe  communication  to  the  cars  actually followed  the  receipt \nof Butler's  call. \nH-11 \n\nJUL  4  of  Butler and Hopkins)  Some  white men  came \ninto  the  viewing  area.  They  cuZ'sed \n(Testimony  of Hopkins)  and  shouted,  \"Get  out \nof :here ;  you  don โข t  be long โข\"  (Tes tim.ony  of \nButler)  Some  Sheriff  s  officers  in khaki \nt \nuniform came  into the viewing  area,  but  they \ndid nothing.  (Testimony  of Hopkins) \nAfter the Negroes  had left the white  section, \nSheriff  Clark returned.  Butler asked Clark \nto  station some  men  in the  theater,  but  Clark \ndeclined.

The \nphotographs  of vehicles  which were  identified as  those \nstruck by  thrown  objects  (Def.  Ex.  6C  through  6G)  show only \nminor damage.  It is  possible  that some  objects were  thrown \nafter the  order had been  given  to  the  officers  to  disperse \nthe  Negro  crowd. \nThere  is also  a  dispute  as  to whether  the  gunshot which \nmany  witnesses  heard was  fired before or after the  order  to \ndisperse  the  crowd.  Deputy  Crocker  testified that he  heard \na  muffled shot before  he  gave  the  order to  disperse.

Then  the  tv10  men  became \nphysically  separated,  and when  Prince  turned \nto  look for  DeHuth,  a  flashlight beam  hit \nhim  in the  eyes.  In  back of  the  Hall  a  group \nof possemen  rushed  toward  Prince  and  DeMuth. \n2/ \nIt is  impossible  to  determine  from  the  testimony which \nof  the  two  newsmen  tried to  follow  Leashore  into r'lrs.

Opposite  the  nยทame \nof each witness  is  the  page  or pages  at which his  testi \nmony  is summarized  in Table  B or in Table  c. \nSummaries  of  the  testimony of  the witnesses who \nappeared during  the. plaintiff's case  constitute Table  B. \nTable C consists  of  summaries  of  testimony  of witnesses \nwho  appeared  during  the  defendants'  case. \nThe  summaries  within both  tables  appear  in  the  order \nin which  the witnesses  appeared.  If a  person  testified \nmore. than onc.e,  the  summary  of his  testimony  at each \nappearance  is  in  it:s  appropriate  chronological  piace. \nPlaintiff's trial notes  are  the Qasis  of  the  sum-\nmaries.  The  summaries  are only  as  accurate  as  the  legal \nexperience  of  a  young  secretary and  the  secretarial \nexperience  of  the  plaintiff's lawyers would  allow.:  Quota \ntion marks  denote  language  the  note-takers  thought  the \nwitness  used.  This  is  true even when  the  witness was \nreporting  an  out-of-court declaration;  quotation  do \nmarl~ \nnot necessarily indicate  the  witness was  attempting  to \nquote  the  out-of-court declaration. \nFor clarity,  the  testimony  of each witness  has  been \nbroken  down  by event or subject matter;  the  direct and  cross \nexamination of each event  integrated, . and  the  integrated \nsummaries  of each event arranged  in an  order that  is gener \nally chronological.

I  go  to  Hudson  High School.  I  am  not  a \nmember  of  any  organization and haven't gone  to  any  school \non  sit-ins.  No  one  told us  to  go  down  to  the movies,  but \nI  decided  to  go  on  the Fourth because  the  bill was  signed \nthe  day before. \nI  saw  a  group  of  deputies  and white  persons  by  the bus \nstop when  I  arrived  at  the t,Tilby  Theater  at about  2:30. \nThe  deputies  had  guns  and  nightsticks  and wore  silver badges. \nThere  were  8  or 10  deputies  and  about  15 white  person.s  in \nfront  of  the  theater.  Some  police  cars were  cruising by, \nand  a  Sheriff's Department  car was  stationary at  the  bus \nstop.  The  manager of  the  theater,  Hr.  Butler,  asked  if the \nother Negroes  and  I  wanted  to  enter the  section  previously \nreserved  for whites;  this was  around  three  o'clock.ยท  I \nentered the white  section with  about  ten  other Negroes, \ntook  a  seat,  and watched  the  movie  for  about  45  minutes. \nl1r.  Butler told us  that some. whites  had  gathered outside \nand  that  for our own  sake we  should leave.  Some \n~vhites, \nabout  5  or 6,  came  into  the  theater cursing.  I  got up  to \nleave;  a  white man  stepped  in  front  of me,  and  I  tripped. \nThere  were  deputies  in  the  theater,  right behind  the whites, \nbut  the  deputies  did nothing.  vfuen  I  left,  3  or 4  deputies \nin khaki uniforms  were  still at the bus  stop.  Police  cars \nwere  still cruising by,  but  I  saw  no  Sheriff's  Department \ncars. \n-B-1 \n\nI  ,  , \n(Negrd) \nI  t>Tas  born  in Selma,  Alabama,  and  lived near here until \n~1e moved  to  Gary,  Indian.a,  in  1945.  I  am  now. living in \nCambridge,  Massachusetts,  attending Harvard,  where  I  am  in \nthe  second half of my  junior year. \nIn  the  summer  of 1964,  I  came  to  Selma  ยทwitih  . \nSilas Nonnan,  Karen  House,  Carol Lawson,  and Hary  Varella, \nto work on  a  literacy project.  I  had  done  the  same  type \nof work before,  teaching  adults  reading  and writing. \nOn  July 4,  1964,  the  literacy project staff met  at the \nmission  to  dra'l:-1  up  a  reading  and writing  program.  Then we \nwere  going  to  the  SNCC  office  to  use  a  mimeograph machine. \n\"Je  had not had lunch.  I  had heard that  two  separate groups \nof Negroes  had been  served  at  the  Thirsty Boy  Drive  In. \nA little after noon,  Lawson,  House,  Norman  and  I  drove \ninto  the Thirsty Boy  parking  lot.  ~-\\fe  got out of  the  car.  A \ngentleman  came  out and  said \"You  might  as  well go  away.  This \nis private  property.\"  The  man  went  right back inside.  He \ndrove  away  and  parked on Broad Street.  Then  all four  of us \ncrossed Broad  and went  into  the  Thirsty Boy. \nHe  took seats  at a  table  in the middle  of the  dining \narea.  There were  several  persons  present.  No  one  said \nanything  to  us.  I  noticed  a  self-service  sign  and  told \nNorman  we  had  to  order.  Norman  went  to  the  counter by  the \nbig  (service)  window.  A waitress  left and went  into  the \nback room.  Norman  stood there  several minutes.  I  did not \nhear Nr.  ยทvrarren  tell Norman  to  leave. \nThe  Sheriff and  seven  or eight deputies  came  in.  The \nSheriff ~1ent to  the  small  (tray)  window  and  said,  \"You want \nthem  all arrested,  don't you?\"  Hr.  Harren  said,  \"No,  I  just \nwant  them out  of here.\"  The  Sheriff repeated his  question. \nSomeone  then  handed some  papers  through  the  windows;  I  think \nit was  the  Sheriff who  handled  the  papers,  but  I'm not  sure. \nThen  the Sheriff came  over and  said,  \"All right,  let's \ngo.\"  The  Sheriff  touched me  with a  small  instrument  that \nproduced  a  jolting sensation.  He  did that also  to  the  others. \nWe  got up  and were  escorted to  the  car by  the Sheriff.  On \nthe way  to  the  car Norman  was  prodded.  Norman  was  taken  to \none  car and  then  taken  out  and  put  in  the  other car.  I  got \nin  the  back seat last;  I  got  a  jolt and  jumped.  Norman  was \nbeing  jolted by  the Sheriff and  seemed  to  be  in pain;  he was \ntrying  to avoid  the  jolts.  The  Sheriff said,  \"Are  you  trying \nto  kick me?t \n\nweยฅ~ ~eing \nI \nUhile  Norman  and  fingerprinted  at the \njail,  the  Sheriff asked each of us  twice  whith was  the  one \nwho  tried to  kick him.  The  Sheriff then  charged me  with \nresisting  arrest. \nI  stayed in  jail seven  days.  vJhen  I  was  and \nreleas~d \ngot my  car back,  a  camera  and  several  papers  were  missing. \nI  did not attend  any  mass  meetings  or organize  sit-ins. \nI  was  working  on  the  literacy project. \nI  was  served with the  injunction while  in  jail. \nB-2-b \n\n;:lA\\lSbp \nCA.3Qt \ntN~g~o) \nI  war:;  born  and  raised  in the  Bron:M:  and.  reside  there noW'.-- \nI  am  19  arid ;itl  rri~  junior y~ar at Howard  University  in Hashing ... \ntonโข  My  major  is English with  a  minor  in  journalism. \nxw \npurpose  in being  in  Selma  last summer  was  to  work with \nadult education;  I  lived at 804  Sylvan  Street with Karen  House. \nOur  first activity  in Selma was  a  reception at which we  met \nsome  adult leaders.  The  five  of us  [in  the Adult  Literacy \nProject;  see  p.  B-2-a]  held meetings  among  ourselves.  1tJe \nheld no  mass  meetings;  I  attended none. \nl-Je  t~ent to  the  Thirsty Boy  after using  the  mimeo  at \nSNCC;  we  made  copies  of registration  application  forms  and \nnotices  of  clinics.  T-re.  were  there  a  short '\\'lhile,  time  for \ntwo  drags  on  a  cigarette,  when  the  Sheriff  came  in.  I  saw \nhim hand papers  to  a  man,  saying,  \"Here  are  the  warrants  for \nyou  to  sign.\"  '!he  Sheriff  came  over,  and  I  felt a  cattle \nprod.  I  did not hear  the  word  \"Arrest\" until we  were  toward \nthe  door. \nThere  \\i1as  confusion  at the  car.  I  slid across  the  back \nseat on my  knees.  'diley  and Horman  were  being  prodded. \nI  bought  a  brand new  bicycle  from  Sears before  coming \nto  Selma;  it was  sent  to  meยท.  ,.vith  the bicycle,  I  bought  two \nfeet of  chain;  I  also  bought -a  combination  lock from  a  five \nan.d  ten.  I  used  the  chain  and  lock from  the  time  my  bike \narrived  in Selma until my  arrest.  I  wrapped  the  chain  around \nthe  spokes  of my  bicycle  and  around  a  nearby  post or similar \nobject  to  lock my  bike;  Karen  House  and  I  usually  locked our \nbiY~s together with my  chain.  On  July 4,  I  left my  bike  in \nour house,  locked  the  house,  and  took my  chain with me  to  lock \nKaren  House's  bicycle ..  Hers  was  at the  :Mission.

I  came  to  Selma  in Barch  1964 \nas  field  secretary for SNCC  and  stayed  in  town  almost \ncontinuously until July.  After the  arrest,  I  stayed until \nthe  Friday before  Labor Day.

I  did \nnot  participate  in  any  demonstrations. \nOn  July  4,  1964,  I  went  to  the  Thirsty  Boy  because  of \nthe  1964  Civil Rights Act  and because  someone  (possibly \nAlvery vJilliams)  had  said  the  Thirsty Boy  served  Negroes. \nIn  the  parking  lot I  heard no  violent  language.  We \nwere  asked  to  leave  the  parking  lot. \nHy  back was  to  the window,  so  I  did not  see  papers \nbeing  given  to  anyone  in  the Thirsty Boy. \nI  was  arrested.

I  went \nfrom my  home  at 1309  Duke  Street to  the  theater.  I  walked \nsouth on  Broad Street to l;Joolworths'.  There  was  a  large \ngroup  there,  a  larger group  across  the  street,  mostly \nNegroes.  I  asked  some  friends  what was  going  on.  Someone \nsaid  that  some  Negroes  had  gone  into  the Wilby  Theater. \nI  asked  if my  friends  planned  to  go  in.  I  saw no  deputies \nor policemen.  I  saw  one  car,  but  I  don't know  whether it \nwas  a  police  car or a  sheriff's  car.  There  was  a  crowd  in \nfront of vroolworths',  I  clidn 't notice  any  crowd by  Carter \nDrug. \nI  went up  to  the  ticket window  with Joe  Smitherman,  a \nNegro  friend.  Smitherman  got  in,  but  I  did not.  As  soon \nas  I  started to  go  in,  a  white  civilian asked,  \"\\fuere  are \nyou going?\"  I  said I  was  going  in  the  door.  The  civilian \nsaid,  \"Hrong  entrance.\"  I  answered,  \"I bought  a  ticket  for \nthis  door.\"  The  civilian  cursed.  The  crowd began  whooping \nand  yelling.  The  crowd  was  Negro.  He was  the  only white  man \nthere  at  first.  He  blocked my  way  again..  I  stepped back. \nBy  then,  Standberry had bought  a  ticket.  Standberry  asked \nthe white  man  if he  represented  the  management.  The  white \nman  answered,  \"No.\"  t-Jilliams  said,  \"Then  you  have  no  right \nto  block  [the  entrance] โข \"  I  didn'tยท knotttยท  who  Williams was; \nI  don't know  whether he was  urging Negroes  to  enter the \ntheater. \nSeveral white men  came  then.  Someone  said one  of \nthem  had  a  knife.  I  saw  a  white man  with  a  knife.  A Negro \nthen  said he had  a  knife  and  he  pulled it out.  Some  people \npulled him back,  shouting  and  hollering.  't-Jilliams  said, \n\"Get your money.\"  I  got my  money  back.  Then  I  noticed men \nin  uniform.  I  saw  3  or 4.  I  don't know  what  color the \nuniforms  were.  A police  car pulled up.  vJilliams  went  over \nto  it.  I  could hear only  something  like \"Those  kids  need \n11 \nprotection.\"  I  then  heard  something  about  \"If you want  to \nsign  a  warrant.\"  Then  the  pt::>lice  moved  into  the  Negro  crowd. \nThey  moved  it in every direction.  They were  swinging  their \nclubs.  No  one hit me.  I  saw  them  hit Ronald  Fuller.  The \ncrowd  then  ran  away  from  Broad  [toward 't-Jashington] โข  I  don't \nthink the  police went  in  a  specific direction.  I  don't  think \nanybody  could have  been  killed.  I  think  the  police  got  there \nsoon  enough. \n:B-5 \n\nBEN  JACKSON \n(Negro) \nI'm  seventeen and  am  in the  twelfth grade  at Hudson. \nI  attempted  to  go  to  the Wilb.y  Theater  with Leon  Sanders \nand Hazel  Chapman,  a  boy.  There  were  ten Negroes  outside \nthe  theater.  They  said there were  children inside and  it \nwould  be  nice  to  protect  them.  There  were  only three  of \nus,  so we  went  after some  others.  He  got  back,  and  some \nof  the  group  went  in,  but  I  went  to.move  my  car.  \\lhen  I \ncame  bad: the  city police were  by  the  side  of  the  theater. \nPolice  cars  were  patrolling.  I  moved  my  car again,  this \ntime  from  Broad  Street  to Washington Street.  When  I  got \nback  I  met  some  of my  friends.  i~e  stood  in front  of  the \ntheater and  talked for  about  5  minutes,  then  started to \nbuy  tickets.  I  had  been  to  the  theater many  times  before, \nbut  this was  the  first  time  I  tried to  go  in the  white  side. \nNo  one  talked to me  about  it the  day  before,  but we  talked \nabout  it on  the way  downtown.  Ronald  Fuller bought  his \nticket.  Sheriff Clark was  there at  the  time.  He  was  under \nthe  wheel,  maybe,  in his  car;  the  car was  in the middle  of \nthe  street,  headed toward  Washington.  Williams  [meaning \nFuller]  tried to go  in,  but was  hit.  A  short,  stubby white \nperson hit him.  He  [Fuller]  went  back  to  get  his money. \nSheriff Clark was  in a  position to  see  this. \nA white  person pulled a  knife.  I  saw a  Negro  with a \n?nife.  Ueithe~ I  nor  any  other  person  in my  car  carr1ed  a  knife \nRonald  got  his money.  Alvery r,.Jilliams  went  to  see Sheriff \nClark.

He  and  possemen  used  sticks on  the \nNegroes  by  the door.  They  did nothing  to  the  whites. \nI  was  not  hit.  They  just  swung  their sticks and dispersed. \nI  went  baclc  to  the  theater again to  get my  car.  The  group \nwas  still in the  theater.

My  purpose  was  to  go  into. the  theater \non  the white  side.  \\.Ve  went  back to Moss  Amusement  Park to \npick up  some  others,  then we  returned.  We  decided  to  go  to \nthe white  ticket  office. \nAs  I  approached  the  theater,  \"everything  looked  pretty \nnormal.\"  Nothing  special  was  going  on.  \"There  were  sheriff's \nand  police  cars  cruising;\"  I  saw  no  deputy  standing.  Nathaniel \nHarris,  Philip Hunter,  James  Brown,  Godfrey Jones,  Bernard \nCollins,  and  Bernard Sims,  all Negroes,  were  with me.  I \nconsider myself  a  good  friend  of Philip Hunter's.  I  didn't \nleave  the  theater with him.  I  don't  remember  if I  saw him \nlater that  night.  I  didn't  go  by the  Roxy  Theater that \nevening.  We  heard Negroes  had  been admitted.  A white  man \nwearing  a  green  khaki  shirt and brown  khaki  pants  said, \n\"Nigger,  don't  go  in there.\"  He  was  not  a  lawman.  vJe  did \nnothing,  then we  said it was  our  right  to  go  into the  theater. \nThere  were whites  between  the  ticket  window and  the door. \nThere  about  15  to  20  whites  and about  as  many  Negroes  in t\"ront \nof  the  theater.  I  bought  a  ticket  and  started to go  in to \nthe downstairs  part  of the  theater.  The  same  man  hit \nme  in the  jaw.  I  did  not  go  down.  I  did nothing  for  a  while. \nWe  said,  \"it's our  right.\"  The  whites  said,  \"You  don't  belong .. \" \nI  sat..r  policemen then,  \"slowly driving by,\"  but  I  saw  no  police \nmen  by  the  white  entrance.  A Negro  said to the white  who  hit \nme,  \"Who  do  you  think you are?\"  The  white  man  replied,  \"I'll \nshow  you  who  I  am,\"  and  pulled a  knife.  There  was  an  exchange \nof  words.  A Negro  said the knife  was  no  big  thing.  I  saw \nno  Negro  pull  a  knife.  ยท \nI  was  backing  through the  crowd.  I  saw Williams  say  to \nSheriff Clark,  who  was  in  middle  of  the  street,  \"Did  you \nt~e \nsee  that?\"  We're  paying  taxes  like everyone else.\"  The  Sheriff \nsaid,  \"Let  the damn  federal  government  take  care  of  it โขโขโขโข \n:Let  the man  hit swear  out  the warrant.\" \nSheriff Clark  jumped  out  and  swung  at a  Negro,  \"Get  the \nhell  out  of here.  You  don't  belong here,  anyway.\"  [To  the \nquestion asked  on  cross,  Sheriff Clark dispersed  the  crowd, \nright?:]  \"No.  He  dispersed the Negroes.\"  The white men \nstayed. \nI  started to  leave  and  got  almost  to  the  curb when  some \nbody  said to  go  get  my  money.  I  went  back  and got  my  money. \nThe  Negroes  scattered toward Broad Street.  The  white  man  who \nhit me  was  still there.  Other  whites  were  still there.  The \nman  who  hit me  just  stepped back. \nB-7 \n\nI  figured  I  could~'t get  through the  crowd  of whites; \nso  I  followed  behind  the  sheriff and deputies.  They  went \nto \"Jashington and  Selma.  They  threw sticks  at  the Negroes, \nthen  turned.  They  saw me.  I  tried to  run,  but Sheriff  Clarl \nanticipated.  I  thought  about  going  by  and  taking  a  lick, \nbut  decided against  the lick.

There  were  no Negroes.  No  possemen came  to  604 \nLawrence  Street before  I  left.  I  heard a  posseman knock \nat  the  house  across  the  street.

As  I  was \nwalking  along,  a  posseman  said,  \"Didn't I  tell you  to go \nhome?\"  I  answered,  \"That's where  I'm going.\"  The  posse \nman  said 11No,  you  aren't,  you're going  to  the  ground.\" \nThen  he  clubbed me  to the  ground.

Besides  the  Negroes  who  came  to \nthe  meeting,  men  in helmets  with  clubs  and  guns  came.  I \ndidn't  see  the  sheriff;  I  couldn't  identify the  man  in \ncharge.  I  couldn't hear what  was  going  on  inside  the \nmeeting.  I  could hear  singing,  but  I  couldn't hear the \nspeakers.  The  men  in uniform were  walking  back  and  forth. \nMy  driveway was  blocked by  a  school  bus.  There were  be \ntween  80  and 100  men  lining the  street.  I  was  on my  porch \nwith my  wife  and kids  and my  brother-in-law. \nI  saw  the  people  coming  out  of  the  church.  The  people \nwere  just  talking.  Officials weren't  talking.  They had \nno  megaphone  or anything.  Then  I  heard  a  rock  or something \nhit a  car.  \"The  cops  and  the  sheriffs  then  started to  take \nin action.''  They  started clubbing  people.  I  saw  them \nbreak Mrs.  Lamar's  windows.  I  saw  them club  a  white  photo \ngrapher.  He  was  running  toward  ''Mrs.  Cardelia' s11  [Mrs. \nCardelia Lamar]  when  the  officer's clubbed him.  I  heard \nonly one  rock before  the  line  broke.

I  am  sure  there  were  policemen there.  I  can \ntell  the  difference  between Police  and  Sheriff's Department \nmen. \nAnother unusual  noise  I  heard,  beside  the  rock,  sounded \nlike a  gun  or like tear gas. \nI've been arrested once  for  drunk  driving  once  for \ndrinking,  and  twice  for disorderly conduct.

My  husband  and  I  are  separated;  I  once \nhad  him  arrested  for  non-support. \nI  had heard  there  was  a  mass  meeting,  but  I  didn't \nknow  since  I  wasn't  there. \nB-10 \n\nJOHNNIE  LE'ASHORE \n(Negro) \nI'm sixteen;  I've  attended St.  Jude  School  in \nMontgmnery  for  three  years  and  am  in  the  eleventh grade. \nI  live  at  712  Lawrence,  in Selma.  That's  just north of \nGreen  Street Hall. \nI  attended  the  Green Street meeting.  I've \nattended other mass  meetings  too;  there were  sheriff's \npeople  at many  of  them.  There  was  11a tJhole  lot\" of \nthem  at Green  Street  just before  the meeting was  over. \nI  was  in  and  out  of  the  Green  Street meeting,\"but \nI  heard vJillie Robertson  speak.  I  did not  hear  him \ntell  the  audience  to  demonstrate,  nor  did  I  hear  him \ntalk of  white women. \nJohn Love  told us  to  go  straight home,  not  to \narouse  the  possemen.  All  Jim  Clark wants,  he  said,  is \nan  excuse  to  set his  possemen  on  us. \nPeople  began  going home  from  the meeting  gradually. \nThere were  possemen  on  the  opposite  side  of  the \nstr~et, \n\"lined up  side by  side  from  south  to north.  I  heard  a \nbottle hit  a  car  and  a  brick hit  a  car.  Then  the  line  of \npossemen  started to  move.  I  did not hear  any  deputy  say \nanything.  I  was  standing  by  a  white  photographer.  The \nnewsman  said,  \"Let ' s  run.  1  don' t  know where  to  go .\" \nI  suggested going  in a  nearby  house  tNrs.  Lamar's], \njumped  onto  its porch,  and went  inside.  The  newsman  tried \nto  run  to  the  steps  of  the  porch,  but  did not  it \n~ake \ninside.  'VJhen  I  looked out  the  window  of  the  house,  I  saw \nthe  newsman  on  the  ground,  bleeding.  Five  of'  six posse \nmen  were  standing  around,  one  smoking  a  cigar,  another  a \ncigarette.  The  possemen were  shining  flashlights  at  the \nnewsman.  Possemen  came  on  to  Jl1rs.  Lamar's  porch  and \nthrew  a  chair  at  the  screen of  the  window.  One  of  the \npossemen  said,  \"Get  your  ass  on  the  floor. \" \nI  figured  I  shouldn't go  home  through  the  alley \nway,  so  I  went  up  to  Jeff Davis.  A posseman  told me  to \nrun.  lvben  I  got home  I  saw Ned  Johnson.  He  was  bleeding. \nOn  the  morning  of  July  6,  I  went  downtown  with my \nmother.  She  went  to  the  courthouse,  [to  register,  see P. \nB-15),  while  I  went  to  pay  some  bills.  ยทI had paid all \nbut one,  when  I  ran  out of money.  I  went  to  the  alley \nby  the  courthouse  on Alabama Avenue  to  ask  my  mother  for \nmore  money.  A posseman  stepped in front  of me.  I  told \nhim  I  wanted  to  see my  mother,  but he  wouldn't  let me  go \nto  see her  because  I  wasn't  old enough  to  vote.  Eiy \nmother  came  out  and  told me  to  go  straight home.  She \nsaid she'd bring me  the money.  I  was  walking  east on \nB-11 \n\n' \nthe  $idewalk  a.oross  the  street from  the  Federal  Building \nwhen  I  $lil-t. and heard Sheriff ยทClark.  He  announced on  the \nri:d.cro.phone  to  the  persons  on  the  steps  across  the  street, \n''You' re under  arrest.\"  I  continued to 'l:>lalk  toward . \nLauderdale  Street.  I  saw deputies  and lawmen  go  for  the \nstudents  across  the  street.  I  was  waiting  at  the  red \nlight 't..rhen  a  man  in uniform  juked .Qte  and  said,  \"Get  the \nhell  in line.\" \nNo  one  ~ver.told me  the  charge.  No  local official \never  interviewed me โข. ยท  I  was  held 4  days  and  3  nights \nwithout being  interviewed by  officers. \nOn  Thursday,  I  went  to  Judge Reynold's  office,  where \na  lady found  out  how  to  contact my  mother.  On  Friday  I \ncame  back;  my  mother  came  with me.  Judge Reynolds  asked \nif I  had  attended mass  meetings,ยท to which  l  answered yes. \nReynolds  also  asked  if I  planned  to  attend any  more \nmass  meetings;  I  answered no. \nI  never  appeared before Judge  Reynolds  before. \nI've never  heard of Ben  Scroggins.  I  don't  remember \nbeing  scooped up  in his  arms  eight years  ago  while  I  was \ncarrying  a  bottle of whiskey. \nB-11-b \n\nCARDELlA  LAMAR \n(Negro) \nI'm fifty-one,  a  widow.  I  have  a  family.  I've  lived \nnineteen years  in  Selma.  I  work  at 720  Maybrook. \nI  ltve at 712  Green  Street which  is right next  to  the \nA.N.E.  Hall.  I  was  at home  on  July  S,  except for  the  time \nwhen  I  went  to  church.  After  I  came  home  from  church,  I  saw \npossemen.  A meeting wยทas  going  on.  I've never  attended mass \nmeetings.  After  the  meeting,  I  heard  a  rock hit a  car.  The \nwhite men  in  yellow  clothes  and  helmets  started running.  I \nsaw  a  man  in  yellow  clothes  throw  a  chair through my  window \nscreen.  It came  on  to  the  bed.  I  saw  a  photographer lying \non  the  ground.  He  tried to  pass  my  steps,  but  I  saw  himget \nhit.  The  sheriff's men  gathered  around.  I  saw  men  in yellow \nclothes  break  2  windows  at the back of my  house. \nI  saw  some  officers  in  blue  clothes  from  the  city hall \nbuilding  also.  I  did not  see  Sheriff Clark.  I  did not  recog \nnize  any of  the  officers.  The  officers broke  at the  sound  of \nthe  rock.  I  didn't hear  a  shot.  I  did not  see  anybody  piling \nup  rocks  that  afternoon. \nThe  next  day  men  from  the  sheriff's department  came  by. \nThey  said  I  did not  have  to  worry,  and  that I  should call if \nthere was  any  trouble.  Also,  they  told me  that my  grandson \nhad been  outside  and  they  had  to  break  a  window  to  get him \ninside.  That  is not why  they  broke  the window. \nB-12 \n\n'{IJILLIAH  M.  SANDERS \n(White) \nI'm a  physician at  Maxwell  Air  Force  Base.  I've \noccasionally treated emergency  cases  in St.  Margaret's \nHospital,  Montgomery's  only twenty-four hour hospital. \nI've been  in Montgomery  over  a  year.  I  remember  treat \ning Jerry  DeMuth  and  David Prince  on  the  evening  of \nJuly  5.  My  notes  and  records  show  that  DeMuth 1 s  condi \ntion was  generยทally good.  He  was  alert.  He  was  bleeding \nfrom  a  cut,  however,  so  I  treated him  first.  The  cut \nwas  two  inches  long.  An  aide  cleaned  the wound.  I  closed \nit with  7  stitches.  DeMuth  had  a  painfully swollen elbow, \nbut  it was  not  broken.  DeMuth  had  scattered bruises,  some \non his legs.  I  gave  him a  tetanus  booster.  He  was  \"covered \nwith  blood\".  He  was  wearing  a  white  shirt.  He  seemed  a \nlittle addled  about  the  whole  business. \nDavid  Prince  appeared  in a  better general  condition \noutwardly.  There  were  bruises  on his  back.  They looked  as \nif they had be.en made  by a  stick.  He  had  two  bruises  on \nhis  shoulder blades  and  two  in the  middle  of his back,  one \non his  right chest  wall.  They were  visible  bruises,  which \nwere  red  but  later would  turn black and  blue.  I  don't  re \ncall the  condition of his clothing.  I  did not  feel  it \nnecessary for  them  to  stay in the  hospital,  they didn't \nwant  to.  The  records  of treatment  are  dated  July  S,  1964, \nat 11 :30  p.m. \nB-13 \n\nNED  JOHNSON \n(Negro) \nI  live  on Lawrence  Street,  I'm out  of my  senses. \nI  went  to  the  meeting.  A man  in khaki  pants  and  a \nkhaki  shirt, with  something like  a  bucket  on his head, \nhit me.  I  was  right  in front  of  the  hall.  I  was  hit \ntwice.  I  was  knocked  unconscious.  I  was  bloody.  I \ndidn't  go  home.  I  found  my  way  to  someone's  house. \nThen  someone  took me  to  the hospital.  They  did  some \nthing  to my  head. \nI  did not  see  officers before  church.  I  don't \nknow  what  time  I  got  there.  I  couldn't understand what \nWillie  Robertson  said.  I  didn't  run.  I  didn't hear  a \nshot.  I  didn't  smell  tear gas.  I  didn't hear  rocks. \nThere  was  a  \"heap of people\"  there. \nB-14 \n\nVASHTIE  LEASHORE \n(Negro) \nI'm Johnnie Leashore's mother. \nSome  time  after I  returned  from  the  Green  Street \nmeeting  to my  home  on Lawrence  Street, my  ward,  Ned \nJohnson,  was  brought  to me  in a  taxi.  At  that  time, \npossemen were  knocking  on the  doors  and  saying,  \"Cut \nout  your goddamn  lights and  turn off the  television.\" \nHowever,  when  Bubbo  [Johnson]  came,  I  turned on my \nporch light.  A posseman told me  to  turn off the  light. \nI  told him  the  posse  had  nearly killed Johnson.  The \nposseman made  a  phone  call;  I  heard h~ say,  '~e done \ngot  one  of  'em;  what  do  we  do?\"  A sheriff's man  came, \npossibly Bates.  Johnson asked me  not  to let  the  sheriff's \nmen  take  him  anywhere,  and  I  told the  lawmen  I  would \ntake  care  of Johnson. \nOn  Monday,  July 6,  I  went  downtown  with my  son.  I \nwent  to  register,  while  he  went  to  pay  some  bills. \nWhile  I  was  waiting  in line,  I  heard my  son and  a  deputy \nhaving  an argument  over whether my  son could come  into \nthe  alley way  where  the  registration line was.  I  went \nover to where  they were  standing  and,  when  my  son  told \nme  he  needed more  money  to  pay another bill,  I  told \nh~ \nto go  straight home.  I  never got  in to  register  that \nday. \nt,Jhen  I  got home  that night,  I  found  out  they had \narrested Johnnie.  They also  got my  granddaughter,  Gloria \nBostick,  the  next  day. \nI  went  to Judge  Reynolds'  office with Gloria.  She \ntold Judge  Reynolds  she  had  picked her  picket  sign up  off \nthe  street.  He  asked,  \"Didn't  you get  the  sign  from \nAmelia  Boynton's  office?\"  No,  Gloria anst-lered,  I  didn't \nget  the  sign from  ''Mrs.  Boynton's\" office.  Judge  Reynolds \ntold her,  \"Don't  call  any Negro . 'Mrs.'  in this office.\" \nGloria once  more  referred to Mrs.  Boynton  as  \"Mrs.  Boynton\". \nJudge  Reynolds  then  stated,  \"I'm going  to put  you  in jail \none  week;  I  donโขt  like  your  attitude.\"  Gloria did  go  back \nto  jail and got  out  one  week later. \nI  couldn't  say how  many  t~es I've  been arrested for \nprohibition violations.  I  was  sentenced once  to hard \nlabor and  a  fine  for using my  son,  Johnnie,  to carry liquor. \nB-15 \n\nGEORGE  SUTTLES \n(Negro) \nI  was  born  in 1905.  I  spent  all my  life in Selma. \nI  haven't  been  able  to  work for  five  years.  I  used  to \nwork  construction. \nI  was  arrested in front  of  the  Federal  Building.  I \nhad  just turned the corner.  I  had been coming  from my \nhouse,  up Water Street  to  Lauderdale,  then  toward  the \nFederal Building.  I  was  on my  way  to  see  a  lady  about \nmy  income  tax.  I've never  been  to  a  mass  meeting.  I \ndon't know  Clark Nelson;  I  never heard of him.  I \ndon't know  why  I  was  arrested;  no  sheriffs  talked  to me \nabout  it while  I  was  in  jail;  the  policeยท.  didn't  ask \nwhat  I  was  doing  there when  they  arrested me.  I  got hit \nlightly one  time  on  the  t~ay to  jail.  I  was  in  jail one \nweek.  That  [questionnaire  Pl.  Ex.

I  went  to  the  meeting  on  July  5.  vJhen  I  came \nout  of  the hall  I  saw.possemen  lined up,  and  I  saw school \nbuses. \nI  drove  toward  Jeff Davis.  I  saw  some  possemen \nand  stopped to look.  They  forced me  into  a  stranger's \nhouse. \nI  also  went  to  a  r1.1eeting  on  the  6th.  After  the \nmeeting  I  w-as  v.raiting  for  a  ride home.  It was  very \nquiet.  Sheriff  Clark  told Hr.  Gildersleeve  that he \nthought no  bricks  were  going  to  be  thrown  that night. \nGildersleeve  said none  were  thrown,  but  the  sheriff  said \nsome  had been.  Sheriff  Clarl<:  then  said that  if we  didn't \nleave,  he would  take  us  all in. \nB-17 \n\nISABEL  DUHONT \n(Hhite) \nI'm  a  doctor  and have  practiced in  Selma  since 1944. \nI  treated Ned  Johnson  on  the  5th of July,  1964. \nI  was  called about  11:30.  The  patient was  in  the \nemergency  room,  but was  conscious.  Johnson  had  a \nlaceration on  the  left side of his  head which  required \nsix stitches.  He  had  abrasions  on  his  head.  He  was  not \nseriously hurt.  He  walked out. \nB-18 \n\nM.D.  \\-JALKER \n(Negro) \nI've  been  a  doctor  in Selma  for  fifty years.  I \ntreated Odell  Solomon  on  July 4  at  about  9  or 10  p.m. \nHe  was  somewhat  shocked,  and  there  was  some  bleeding. \nI  placed three  sutures  in a  wound  over his left eye \nand  removed  them July 7. \nB-19 \n\nODELL  SOLOMON \n(Negro) \nHy  address  is 1417  Minter Avenue,  Selma,  for  fifteen \nyears~  I'm a  carpenter. \nOn  the  night  of July 4, 1964,  I  was  out  on Broad  Street. \nI  live near Clay's  Casino.  That's  near  the  Roxy \nTheater~ \nI  was  on my  way  home  from my  daughter's.  There  was  a  group \nof  possemen dressed  in khakis,  with helmets,  sticks  and  guns, \nstanding around  a  car.  I  don1t  know  what  happened,  but  I \nheard  that  a  bottle hit a  car.  They  came  over  to where  a \nbunch  of us  was  standing and  told us  to  go  home  or get \ninside.  I  stepped into  a  doorway  and  said I  was  waiting \nfor  a  cab,  then  stepped  out.  I  had  called a  cab.  They \nhit me,  but  they didn't knock me  down.  I  went  to  Dr. \nvJalker. \nThere  were  city policemen.  [In response  to  the \nquestion on  cross-examination,  '~eren't they directing \ntraffic when  they hit  you?\":]  Yes. \nB-20 \n\nJAl-1ES  ClARK \n(White) \nI  assume  there  are  booking  sheets  for  1964  other  than \nthose  I  have  produced  [as  of  December  91.  They are  filed \nalphabetically in my  office.  Mrs.  Wayne  Jones  and Mr.  Moseley \nare  the  persons  who  can  be  checked  for  information concern \ning  the booking  sheets. \nI  am  not  sure what  radio  logs  I  brought  with me. \nMr.  Young  keeps  them.  There  are  two  central  radios  that \nmaintain  logs.  There  is one  transmitter,  with  six outlets; \nall are  on  the Alabama  state trooper network.  After the \ncalls for  a  day  are  recorded,  they are  filed.  Later,  they \nare destroyed.  I'll check to  see  if any  are missing  from \nthe  first  two  weeks  in July. \nFingerprint  cards  are filed by  classification.  IYloseley \ncan  be  checked  about  them. \nI  gave  the  government  a  copy  of the posse  list in a \nprevious  trial.  Captains  of  the  posse  are  elected;  I  don't \nknow  how  many  members  there  are. \nAs  to  the mass  meetings,  I  know  I  have  no  tape  record \nings  of  what  went  on.  I  think I  \"must\"  have  notes  of  them. \nB-21 \n\nRUFUS  HEAD \n(White) \nI  brought  the records  subpoenaeCI.  by  the government .. \nI  complied as well as  possible with  the  subpoena. \nB-22 \n\nJERRY  DeNUTH \n(White) \nI'm a  free-lance  writer for  national  magazines. \nI've done  research for  SNCC.  I  now  live  in Atlanta.  I've \nworked  pretty much  full  time  for  SNCC  since  mid-summer. \nSNCC  does  not  advocate  demonstrations  and  sit-ins to \nprovoke  violence.  They  do  advocate  picketing.  I've \nalso worked  for the  American Friends  Service  Committee, \na  Quaker  organization,  for  two  years  in Dayton,  Ohio. \nWhen  I  came  to Selma on July  5,  I  was  employed  by \nBlack  Star,  an  organization that  provides  photos  and  cap \ntions  to  such magazines  as  Time  and Life.  It's not  on  the \nHouse  Unamerican Activities  Committee  subversive  list, \nso  far  as  I  know. \nTJ.Je,  David Prince  and  I,  came  to Selma because  we \nknew  there  was  to  be  a  voter registration drive  and  be \ncause  there 't-ias  to be  some  testing.  We  knew  there might \nbe  picketing.  l'le  came  to  do  some  stories  on  these \nactivities.  I  came  not  to direct any  activities,  but  to \nobserve  and  interview. \nvJe  registered at  the Albert  Hotel,  then contacted \nthe  sheriff's  office.  vJe  't'1ent  to  the  sheriff 1 s  office \nabout  11:30.  Deputies  or officers  in brown khaki uniforms \nwere  downstairs  at  the  courthouse  around  the  office  of \nDeputy Crocker,  and  inside his  office.  There  'tvere  \"at \nleast  thirty\" uniformed officers  at  the  courthouse.  T-Je \nsaw  Deputy  Crocker,  who  asked questions  and  filled out \nforms  about  us.  Blanchard  Crocker,  Prince,  and \n~1cLeod, \nI  were  in the  room  then.  Prince  and  I  said we  were  on an \nassignment  from  the  Black Star Agency  to cover  civil  rights \nactivities.  We  had  a  general  conversation on  reporting and \nvoter  registration.  Crocker  told us  that  press  credentials \nwould  do  no  good  because  he  could  not  keep us  out  of  any \nplace.  1-icLeod  said  something 1 ike,  \"Negroes  demonstrate \nonly when  newsmen  are  present.  They v.Jant  publicity.\"  l.Je \nate  then at  the  Selma  Del.  From  there we  went  to  the  SNCC \noffice,  to  the Literacy Project,  to Nrs.  Boynton's  home, \nto the  Freedom office;  and  to  our hotel.  \\.Je  ate  supper  at \nthe  Selma  Del.  After  stopping briefly at  the hotel,  we \nwent  directly to the  Green Street Hall.  John Love  told us \nabout  the  meeting.  \\.Je  arrived early,  to  set up  the  camera \nequipment.  About  four  or five  uniformed  officers were \nstanding by a  car  in front  of the  hall.  The  meeting  began \nabout  7:40  and ended  about  9:30.  About  six persons  spoke \non  the  subjects  of voter  registration and  the use  of \nrestaurants  dovmtown  by Negroes.  One  speaker said,  we \ndon 1 t  want  wh:ite  tl7omen,  tve  have  our  own.  I  heard  nothing \nabout  raping white  women.  There  was  singing,  but  no  dis \nturbance  or disorder  in the meeting.  I  took notes,  and  Prince \nphotographed  speakers  and  the  singing.  He  moved  about  ' \nB-23 \n\nand  didn't  attempt  to  what  he  was \nhid~ \ndoing.  I  made.  no  speech  and W'as  not.identified to  the \nmeetifig..  i:.t  a.bout ,8:30  or 8:4-5 'I iodked outside  the \nmeetingยท  and  saw  a  1arge  number  of  sheriff's deputies  and \npossemen,  forty  or  fifty.  L'iost  wore  khaki  uniforms  and \nhelmetsโข  the  same  as  those  worn  by  the  officers  I  had \nearlier  at  the  courthouse.  SoQe  were  dressed in greyJ \nse~rt \nTwenty-five  or  so  Negroes  were  outside,  then,  too.  'l\"he \nofficers  were  standing  across  the  street from  the  hall. \nI  had no  conversation  th  any  of  them. \n~.ri \nPrince  and  I  left the  meeting  before most  of  the \npeople  because he wanted  to  get pictures  of  the  people \nleaving  the hall.  There  were  150  to  160  people  at  the \nmeeting,  evenly  divided between  adults  and  youths.  T,-Je  had \nbeen  the  only white  persons  inside  except  for  three  to \nfive  whites  dressed in sport  clothes.  Someone  at  the \nmeeting  said  they  were  local officials. \nAlmost  all of  the  sheriff's officers  'tvere  standing \nin a  line.  There  were  62  or  63  officers  in  the  line.  I \nheard no  orders  given  to  the  Negroes.  As  the  Negroes  left \nthe  hall,  I  heard Negroes  among  themselves.  It \nsperu~ing \nwas  fairly quiet.  I  heard no  Negroes  speak  to \n~vhites. \nI  don't  recollect seeing  any  children running  around.  I \n'tvatched Prince  take  pictures.  He  made  no  attempt  to hide. \nTJe  heard  that  the  building ~Jas being  locked,  so  we  went \nback  in for  our  equipment.  I  carried  the  fl0.odlights.  I \nheard  a  noise  behind me  and  turned.\"  I  didn't hear  any \nroclcs  thrmm.  I  saH possemen  swinging  clubs.  I  heard  a \nman  tell  a  woman  to  get her  child inside.  I  wยทas  struck \nfrom  behind  and  fell  to  my  knees.  I  felt  a  quick,  sudden \npain  at  the  top  of  my  head.  I  \"t<7as  bleedin~.  I  don 1 t  know \nwho  hit me.  I  got  up  in a  daze  and  found  Dave.  He  saw \nme  and  led me  tmยท1ard  the back  of  the  building.  Someone \nshined  a  flashlight  on  nave.  heard a  shot.  Someone \nยท~ \nsaid,  \"Don't ::nove  or you're  dead.\"  Three  possemen  came \neach  of us.  Those  who  crone  toward me  jabbed me \nto~;rard \nwith nightsticks  and  led me  toward  the  front  of  the  hall. \nThey  forced  me  to  the  ground.  I  ยทsaid I  was  bleeding.  On \nthe  'lf7ay  to  the  front  of  the hall,  I  sawยท  an  officer release \ntear gas.  He.  told another  officer  that  there tvere  kids \n\"under  there.\"  I  sa'tl7  a  policeman  smash  Prince 1 s  camera with \na  nightstick.  I  was  wearing  glasses  and  carrying floodlights . \nSomeone  hit me  on  the  side.  of  the head  and knocked off my \nglasses.  They  smashed  the  floodlights.  Someone  said that \nPrince had  a  gun.  They  searched us,  but  had no  gun. \n~ยทle \nSomeone  suggested  searching  our  car;  I  unlocked  it.  Dave. \nand  I  stood with  our hands  on  the hood.  I  was  told to  for \nget my  glasses.  Our  car was  parked  on  the  meeting  hall  side \nof  t'te  church.  Someone  picked up  the  camera  and 'lil7alked  to \nthe  street  light  and  struck  the  lens  with  a  nightstick. \nSomeone  took  the  camera  and handed it back.  I  sa\"tiT  no  one \nthere  but officers  and  ourselves.  One  officer said,  \"I \nought  to kill you.\"  Another  officer said,  \"I  ought  to  fill \nyou  full of  lead.\"  ยทNo  officer offered any  medical \nassistanc~. \nB-23-b \n\nSolicitor HcLeod  yelled at us;  he  said we  should go  to \nthe  hotel,  pack,  and  leave  town,  and  not  stop until  we \nhad  left the  state.  Dave  drove,  because  my  glasses were \ngone.  We  packed,  paid  our bill,  and  left.  I  was  wear \ning  a  suit  and  a  white  shirt.  Blood 'l:.v\"as  over my  face, \nsuit,  and  shirt.  There  was  a  police  car at  the  hotel \nand  the men  inside watched us.  \\Rlen we  left,  a  station \nwagon  follm-Jed  us  for  ten or fifteen minutes. \n~~ \nI  received medical  treatment  at  a  hospital  in \nHontgomery. \nB-23-c \n\nMINNIE  B.  ANDERSON \n(Negro) \nI 've  been  in charge  of  the  Burwell  Infirmary  since \n1926. \nJohn Hardy was  brought  by ambulance  to  the  Burwell \nInfirmary at 10:30 p.m.,  JulyS,  1964.  Hardy had  a  cut \non his head  and  back.  His  wounds  were  dressed  at  the \ninfirmary.  No  stitches were  required.  He  was  given a \ntetanus  shot.  His  skull  was  x-rayed.  He  was  in the \ninfirmary  for  2  days.  His  doctor was  E.  L.  :Haddox. \nB-24 \n\nDAVID  PRil'tCE \n(White) \nI'm  twenty-two;  I'm from  Yellow  Springs,  Ohio.  l'm \nin school  now.  I  do  some  free-lance  photography work. \nDuring  the  summer  of 1964  I  worked  for  the  Southern \nDocumentary Project;  Life,  Black Star,  andothers  cooper \nated  on  it.  We  were  to do  a  documentary  on  the  South, \nmostly  in Mississippi.  First  I  went  to Oxford,  Ohio,  to \nphotograph  the  COFO  training of  the  summer  civil  rights \nworkers.  I  was  there  about  three  days.  I  followed  that \ngroup  south.  I'm not  a  member  of  SNCC  and  don't  work  for \nSNCC.  There's  a  standing  agreement  between SNCC  and  the \nSouthern  Documentary  Project. \nI  arrived  in  Selma  with Jerry  DeMuth  between 11  and \n11:30  on  the  Sunday after July 4.  We  had  been  in Atlanta \non  the  Fourth and  received  a  report  of  some  disturbance. \nWe  went  to  the  sheriff's office  and  saw  Deputy Crocker. \nWe  were  asked  to give  information to  Crocker.  Crocker \nsaid  there  was  no  such  thing  as  a  press  card  valid  in \nDallas County.  He  said he  could  not  be  responsible  for \nour  safety and  he  advised us  to  leave  town.  As  the  conver \nsation ended,  he  told us  to  leave  town.  We  answered  that \nwe  planned  to  cover  the  registration and  other activities \nin Selma.  I  saw  officers  in grey uniforms  with  nightsticks. \nIt was  they who  told us  that  the  sheriff was  not  in,  but \nthat  a  deputy was.  The  hall  of  the  courthouse  was  filled \nwith  deputies.  Solicitor McLeod  was  in the  deputy's  office. \nThe  deputy,  McLeod,  DeMuth,  and  I  were  in the  office.  FBI \nagent  Frye  was  in the  office  at  times.  The  deputy  conducted \nthe  conversation.  McLeod  interrupted occasionally.  His \ngeneral  tone  was,  \"I  don't  like  the  northern  press;  mind \nyour  own  business.\" \nAfter  that,  we  went  to  the  Freedom House,  to  the \ndowntown  office  of SNCC,  to  the  house  of a  lady who  ran \nfor Congress,  and  to  see  John Love.  We  learned  there  was \nto be  a  Negro  meeting  at  Green  Street.  i.-Je  had  an  evening \nmeal  at  the  Selma  Del  Restaurant  where  I  saw  a  men  whom  I \nlater saw  at  the  Green Street hall  in uniform.  The  man  was \nwell-built,  weighed  about  220  lbs.,  and  was  in his  early \n40's.  A  short  order  clerk beckoned  the  man  over  and  pointed \nto us.  The  man  gave  a  cold stare,  went  to  a  stool,  sat, \nand  stared for  two  minutes  by  the  clock. \nWe  went  to  the  Green Street  hall;  I  took  a  35  milli \nmeter  camera,  Nikon F,  and  3  lenses.  Two  cars  were  parked \non  the  hall  side  of  the  street when  I  arrived ..  I  moved \nabout  ~.nd took  pictures.  I  did ยทnot  try to  disguise what \nI  was  doing.ยท  mยทtites  vTithout  unifo.rms  ':vere  in the  meeting \nhall.  A teenage  Negro  pointed  at  one  of then and  said he \nwas  head  of the Klan  in the  area.  In the  meeting  there \nB-25 \n... \n' . \n\nwas  singing  and  clapping.  The  meeting was  \"very lively\", \nbut  not  in the  sense  of  inciting violence.  There  was \nsinging,  then  speakers,  then singing,  then more  speakers, \netc.  I  don't know  Willie  Robinson.  I  don't  remember  any \ntalk about  white  women.  No  one  said he  expected violence. \nThe  meeting lasted two  and  a  half hours.  When  the meeting \nwas  over,  I  went  out  ahead  of the  crowd.  I  saw  a  line of \nuniformed deputies with  sticks  and  helmets.  There  were \nabout  sixty-three  to  sixty-five  deputies  in the  line. \nThere  were  more  grey than khru'i  uniforms.  I  saw  no  blue \nuniforms.  ~~enever I  turned my  camera  toward  the  deputies, \ntwo  deputies  shined  flashlights  into  the  lens.  I  took \npictures  of the  faces  of  the  people  coming  out  of  the  build \ning.  As  people  came  out,  they were  quiet.  Jerry and  I \nwent  inside  the  building  to  remove  our  equipment.  When  we \ncame  out  some  people  had  left;  the  situation was  about  the \nsame.  About  five  minutes  later,  I  heard  screams  behind me. \nI  turned and  saw  a  white  puff.  I  didn't hear  any  rocks \nthrown.  My  camera was  grabbed  and  smashed  against  the  wall. \nI  was  struck on  the  back  and  pushed  to  the  ground.  I  don't \nknow  how  long  I  was  on  the  ground.  I  picked up my  camera  and \nmoved  toward  the  back of  the  building.  I  was  hit  a  couple \nmore  times  by uniformed  officers.  I  turned  and  saw  Jerry \nin  front  of the  building.  He  was  standing with his hands \nover his  face,  bleeding.  Uniformed  officers  surrounded him. \nI  came  to  get  him  and dragged  him  toward  the  rear of the \nbuilding.  '.Je  became  physically separated.  I  turned  to \nget  Jerry,  and  a  flashlight  beam  hit my  eyes.  Three  posse \nmen  were  coming  toward  us.  I  heard  a  shot.  That  was  the \nonly shot  I  heard.  I  saw  the  man  from  the  Selma  Del;  he \nsaid,  \"Let me  have  him,  I  know  him.\"  He  charged,  with  a \nstick,  I  fell  and  covered my  head  and  rolled.  He  struck \nme  several  times,  but  I  was  able  to keep moving.  I  tried \nto get  my  body under  the meeting hall.  He  got  in some  pretty \nhard blows.  Tear gas  was  thrown under  the  building.  Several \nNegroes  were  dragged  out.  I  was  exposed  to  a  lot of  tear \ngas,  as  was  the  man  hitting me.  I  was  dragged  to  the  front \nof the  building  and  was  told to  sit down.  When  I  began  to \nsit down,  one  of the  officers  said,  ''No,  not  here\",  and \nkicked me.  'ยทJhen  I  began  to  sit down  again,  one  of  the  officers \nsaid,  \"No,  not  there,\" and kicked me.  I  laid dmvn  and  was \nsearched.  I  saw  Jerry sitting.  The  man  from  the  restaurant \nsaid,  \"He  has  a  gun.\"  They  searched me.  Then  the  officers \ntook  the  keys  to  the  car from  DeNuth.  l,.Te  were  put  up  by  a \npatrol  car while  DeMuth's  car was  searched.  I  didn't  see \nCrocker  there.  A man  who  was  identified as  Sheriff Clark \nby  the  deputies  came  up  and,I  think,  ordered  the  search of \nteNuth's car.  We  were  put  in the  sheriff's car.  A deputy \ntook my  camera  and  hit  the  lens with his  night  stick. \nThe  sheriff got  the  camera  and  said  ''You  can't do  that,\" \nand  handed  it to me.  About  3  minutes  later,  I  saw McLeod. \nHe  screamed at us,  \"Go  back to  your  hotel,  get  your  things, \nand  get  out  of Alabama  or you'll  be  killed and  followed.\" \nNo  one  followed  us  to  the  hotel.  We  left the  hotel.  A \ndark  station wagon  followed us.  There  were  no  uniformed \nB-25-b \n\nmen  in the  station wagon.  ,,_,e  went  to  lVlontgomery  and \nwent  to  a  hospital.  A  state  investigator  interviewed \nus  there.  After a  three-hour  interview,  we  signed \nstatements.  At  Green Street  a  man  in khakis  with  a \nhelmet  and  gas  mask  and  a  rifle told me  he  was  a  state \ninvestigator.  He  said,  \"The  Negroes  started it, didn't \nthey?\"  I  said,  \"I  don't  know.\"  I  didn't  say a  Negro \nhit me. \nThe  body  of the  camera was  slightly damaged;  it was \nreparable..  One  lens was  damaged  beyond,  repair.  The \nlights were  smashed. \n[To  the  question on cross:  11The  deputies were  trying \nto  get  you  two  out  of all  that  mess,  weren't  they?\":] \n\"I  don't  believe  so.\" \nB-25-c \n\nFRANK  LaPORTE \n(White) \nI'm a  police  captain.

I  live  ยท:now  in Jacksonville,  Florida.  I  was \nassigned  to  Selma  during  the  week  of July 6.  I  arrived \nfrom Mobile  the  afternoon of July 5  with at  least  two \nothers.  He  were  assigned because  of prior disturbances \nand  the  coming  registration drive. \nI  took  all  the  photographs  from  July 6  [in plaintiff's \nexhibit 14].  The  first  picture  appears  by  the  shadows  to \nhave  been  taken around  noon.  Approximately  twenty-five \ncl:J.poed.  during  that  serieG  of  pictures.  I  photographed \nthe  picket  signs  later.  The  pickets were  in front  of  the \ncourthouse  one  or two  minutes  before  they were  arrested. \nThe  man  with  the  mike  in his hand  in the  third picture  is \nJames  Clark.  The  man  in the white  shirt  is  Blanchard McLeod. \nSheriff Clark made  two  announcements  over  the  loudspeaker \n\"Stay lvhere  you are;  you're  all  under  arrest,\" and  \"They're \nrunning  around  the  corner.\" \nThe  last four  [pictures]  on July 7  are  mine.  I  took \nthe  first  picture with  a  telephoto  lens  from  the  third floor \nof  the  Federal  Building.  It portrays  several  possemen  and \npossibly one  deputy  in the  alley.  The  second  picture  shows \nthe  other side  of  the  alley;  one  deputy and  tlvo  possemen  are \nthere.  The  third picture  is of the  alley door.  The  fourth \nis  of  the  door  to the  office  of  the  board  of  registrars. \nThe  last  three  pages  of pictures on July 8  are  mine. \nThe  first  picture was  taken at  12:58  pGm.  The  series  goes \nto  about  1:15 p.m. \nI  took  all  the  pictures on  July 9.  They  run  chrono \nlogically.  The  first lvas  taken at 1:30  p.m.  'Ihe  Negroes \nhad  stood there  two  or three minutes  before  they were \narrested.  Approximately  ten minutes  elapsed  in the  series. \nHcLeod  is in none  of  the  pictures.  Sheriff Clark  is in \nthe  second,  third,  and  fourth  pictures. \nThe  pictures  at  night were  taken on  Broad  Street  at \nthe  Tabernacle  Baptist  Church.  They  show  sheriff's posse \nmen  and  deputies. \nI  took  all  the  pictures on  July 10.  They  show  posse \nmen  around  the  Dallas  County Courthouse  shortly after \nlunch.  The  first was  taken  from Alabama  and Church.  All \nwere  taken within a  block of  the  courthouse. \nB-27 \n\nJOSEPH  CONNELLY \n(White) \nI'm a  special  agent  with the  Nobile  Division of \nthe  FBI.  I  was  in Selma  on  official business  from \nJuly 6  to July 10.  SNCC  did not  order me  up  here;  my \nsuperiors  did. \nI  took  some  of the  pictures  [in plaintiff's exhibit \n14].  The  first  sequence  of pictures,  taken  on July  7, \nconsisting of eight  pictures,  took  about  three  or  four \nminutes.  I  had  been  standing across  the  street  and  saw \nfour  children with posters. \nI  took  the  first  fourteen  pictures  on  July 8.  I \nwas  standing  in approximately the  same  place  as  the  day \nbefore.  The  first  two  pictures,  taken before  noon, \nshowยท  ABC  television men.  At  one  time,  almost  the  whole \nfront  steps  of  the  federal  building  t-lere  occupied with \nnewsmen.  The  next  series  of  pictures,  which  required \nabout  three  or  four  minutes  to  take,  was  tru~en during \nthe  noon hour  and  shov1s  persons  being put  in a  car.  The \nnext  series,  of three  photographs,  was  taken  about  1  p.m., \nwithin a  half hour of  the  last  series.  It depicts  a  man \nwith a  placard on the  steps.  The  last  four  pictures \ntaken on  July  8  were  taken within  fifteen minutes  of  the \nprior series;  they took  four  minutes.  They  show  a  youngster \non  the Lauderdale  Street  side  of  the  courthouse. \nOn  the  morning  of  July 8,  I  took  three  pictures \nlooking  into  the  alley way  on  the Alabama  Avenue  side  of \nthe  Dallas  County Courthouse. \nB-28 \n\nLEONARD  CROCKER \nOfuite) \nI  am  Sheriff  Clark's  Chief  Deputy. \nI  signed all  those  affidavits  [in Pl.  Ex.  No.  15]. \nEach  charges  the  arrested person with contributing  to  the \ndelinquen~ of Claude  Nelson.  The  only record  I  have \nconcerning  the  illegal activities  of  the  persons  arrested \nis  this  [Pl.  Ex.  No.  15].  I  don't remember  what  Eddie Allen \ndid with Claude  Nelson.  I  don't remember  seeing  any  person \nwith Claude  Nelson.  I  have  no  information about  that now. \nv~ didn't have  to have  any  information,  since  the  arrests \nwere  made  on sight.  Our  policy is that each man  is quali \nfied  to  make  an  arrest  if he  sees  the  offense  committed. \nI  made  the  decision  to  arrest  these  persons  for  contribu \nting  to  the  delinquency  of a  minor.  I  made  this  decision \non  the  bas:is  of  the  fact,  that  they  had  juveniles  in their \nch~ge.  I  know  that there was  a  batch of  singers;  and \nClaude  Nelson was  in the  group.  Automobiles  brought  little \nNegroes  with signs.  Some  of  the  people  named  in the \ncontributing charges  drove  pickets;  I  don't know  which \nones;  I  ha~e no  records  with me;  I'll look for  them.  Con \ntributing  charges  have been used  since  the  fall of  1963 \nwhen  so  many  children missed  school-ยทfor  picketing.  Bail \nwas  fixed  immediately for  all persons  in the  mass  arrest. \nTo  be  arrested for  interfering with the  Court,  more  is \nnecessary  than  just lY'alking  to pay  a  bill.  .\"You  could \nvery well  tell\" if the  persons  were  just passing.  Hilliam \nHoods  must  have  been interfering with the  Court  \"if he \nwas  arrestred,  he  was.\"  \"Exactly what  he was  doing,  I  don't \nknow\";  he 11o1as  present.  Hy  method  of  determining who  was \ninterfering with  the  Court was  not  to  see  if the  person \nwas  a  Negro.  Besides  presence  in the  area,  picketing, \nclapping,  singing,  and  chanting would  qualify  persons  for \narrest. \nThe  sheriff's department  handles  the  numbers  system \nfor  regist:ration.  A person comes  and  gets  a  number.  He \ncan  leave without  losing  his  place,  so  long  as  he  returns \nby  the  timโขe  his  number  is called.  The  system was  set up  a \nfew  days  a:Eter  October  7,  1963,  when  there  was  a  line of \n300  or morโขa  persons  waiting  to  register.  Before  the  number \nsystem,  a  ]Person who  left the  line went  to  the  end  of  the \nline.  He  put  the  line by  the  side entrance; JJthere  is more \nrooms  t.herโขa;  restrooms  are  available;  it1s  just more  con \nvenient.  The  lines were  predominatly  Negro  only when  they \nhad  a  registration drive.  A maximum  of  60  numbers  was \nhanded  out  each day  under  the  system.  The  maximum was  set \nafter  the Board  of Registrars  said that  there  had never  been \nanything  l:tke  the  line of  300  that  appeared  on  October  7.  - \nThe  number,  60,  was  based on  the  largest number  ever regis \ntered. \nB-29 \n\nGEORGE  STOVES \n(Uhite) \n1  am  the assistant chief deputy  sheriff.

Then  I  left and went  up \ntown  for an  ironing board  cover.  After  I  bought  the cover, \nI  started for  the place my  husband works.  He  works  at \nthe Bailey MOtor  Company  on  the corner of Church  and \nt-Jater.  I  wanted  to  get him  to  drive me  home  or let me \nhave  the car.  The way  I  always  do.  I  was  goin.g \\i1est  on \nAlabama  toward  Church Avenue.  I  l'Tas  crossing  Lauderdale \nwhen  I  saw  and  heard some  children singing on  the steps. \nI  l<.ept  on walking  on Alabama Avenue.  hfhen  I  saยทw- the \nofficers coming  across  the  street toward  the  federal \nbuilding,  I  turned and  ran back  toward  Lauderdale.  One \nof  the  police told me  to  \"hold  it\".  I  stopped and was \nput  in  line.  I  wasn't  singingยท  I  wasn't  part of  the \ngroup.  I  have circled myself  tin  the first  picture on \nthe  second page  of plaintiff's exhibit  14].  As  I  was \ngoing  up  the steps  to  the  jail,  someone  in khaki clothes, \nwith a  gun  and  a  stick,  juked me  in the rectum.  I  still \nsuffer crawling  sensations  as a  result.

I \nown  the  Boynton Insurance Agency  and  am  a  supervisor  for \nPilgrim Life.  I  have  been  associated with the Dallas  County \nVoter's League  twenty-two  or twenty-three  years.  Its purpose \nhas  been to help  people  learn how  to  register. \nI  was  served with the  injunction on  July 10,  1964.  [For \nMrs.  Boynton's  description of the  activities  of the  respond \nents  to  the  injunction  see Appendix  B.] \nMeetings  were  held every week  from May  14,  1963  to \nJuly 1,  1964.  I  attended most  of  the meetings.  Attendance \naveraged  350,  and  200  was  the  smallest  crowd.  Sheriff's men \nwere  there  at various  times;  they  reported meetings  by walkie \ntalkie,  used tape  recorders,  and  took  notes  at  all but  three \nor four  meetings.  The  speakers  at  the meetings  did not  advo \ncate violence  or disregard for  law and  order.  I  have  spoken \nat the meetings. \nI  did  not  attend the July  S,  1964 meeting  but was  at \nthe July 6  meeting  at Shiloh.  No  meetings  were held  on July 7, \n8,  or  9.  There  was  no  meeting  on  July 4  that  I  know  of. \nAfter the injunction,  churches  continued to hold services, \nbut  they  could have  been  closed. \nI  have  been  registered for  twenty years.  I  encouraged \nNegro  voter  registration.  I  went  to  the  courthouse  as  often \nas  possible to vouch  for  the  people  I  knew.  voucher \n~he \nrequirement  was  frequently  changed. \nConsiderable activity,  including picketing,  began in \nOctober of 1963.  In that month  several  some  of \npic~ts, \nwhom  were  teenagers,  were  arrested.  This  picketing program \nwas  sponsored by SNCC,  not  the Dallas  County Voters League. \nI  did,  however,  let picketers  leave their placards  in my  office. \nB-36 \n\nENOCH  FEARS \n(Negro) \nI'm an  airman  first  class;  I've been  in the Air Force \nthirteen years,  three  at Craig.  I'm an aircraft mechanic. \nI'm from  Cleveland. \nI  called a  group  of Negro  airmen at Craig Air Force \nBase  together  for  a  gathering at the Negro  Elks  Club  on \nJuly 23,  1964.  There  are  about  a  hundred  Negro  airmen  at \nCraig.  The  purpose  of  the meeting was  to  acquaint  Negro \nairmen with the  area,  consolidate  grievances,  and keep \nyounger  airmen  out  of  trouble.  I'm  not  a  member  of  the \nElks  Club.  All  those  who  attended \"tvere  airmen except \nRev.  Smeltzer,  a  minister  from  Illinois.  I  knew him;  he's \nbeen  in Selma  previously.  At  the meeting we  discussed  the \nCivil Rights Act  and  other \nsubjects~ \nSome  time  after the meeting,  I  went  to  the  sheriff's \noffice,  where  I  talked to Chief  Deputy Stoves.  I  was  asked \nwho  gave  permission  for  the  who  attended and how  many \nmeeting~ \npeople were  there.  They  asked me  to  sign a  statement.  They \nasked me  to  identify a  picture of Rev.  Smeltzer.  I  refused \nthe  requests,  saying  I  wanted  to  talk to  a  lawyer  first. \nI  did give  a  statement  to Major  Richardson. \nB-37 \n\nLEO  TASWELL \n(Negro) \nI'm a  staff sergeant  in the Air Force;  I've been  in \nten years  and  ten months.  I've been at Craig  one  year \nand  two  months. \nI  attended the meeting with Airman Fears  on July 23. \nOn  July 26,  I  attempted to get  breakfast  in Selma.  After \ngoing  to  church,  I  saw Airman Scott  and  suggested breakfast. \nWe  first went  to Carter Drug,  where  I  sat next  to a  white \nairman.  The  proprietor  said he  was  sorry,  but he  couldn't \nserve us.  We  left.  I  am  sure  the man  who  asked us  to  leave \nis  the proprietor,  as  I  have  seen him  there  several  times. \nHowever,  I  don't know  Dr.  Harmon  Carter by  name.  We  then \ntried another drugs_tore,  Browns,  I  think,  but  there was  no \ncounter.  Then we  tried to  go  to  the Glass  House.  As  I \napproached  the door,  a  lady said,  \"Don't  come  in here.\" \nI  did not  see Sheriff Clark,  Blanchard McLeod,  or \nJudge  Hare  that  day.  I  was  not  arrested,  but  instead \nreturned to Craig. \nB-38 \n\nErMARD  MULLEN \n(White) \nI  have  been Chief  of  Police  in Selma  for  nineteen \nyears.  We  have  forty-one  men  on  the  payroll.  Our  active \nstrength  is  about  thirty.  Our  duty  is  to maintain law \nand  order within  Selma's  police  jurisdiction,  which  ex \ntends  three miles  outside  the  city.  ~-le  maintain a  radio \nnetwork  and  a  log.  The  log doesn't  state  the  subject  of \na  call unless  it's important.  Our  general  practice  is  to \ncall  through  the  base,  rather than directly car-to-car. \nOur  relations with  the  Sheriff's Office  have  been \nvery  cooperative.  Prior to July 4,  I  had  an understanding \nwith  Sheriff Clark that  the  \"Sheriff's department  would \nhandle  the  racial  matters.\" \nI've observed  racial  matters  in Selma  in the  last \nseveral  years.  Not  all  racial matters  come  to my  attention. \nI've  delegated most  of my  work.  I  don't  wear  a  uniform. \nMost  of our men  wear  a  blue  uniform. \nI  didn't  go  to  the  Uilby.  I  had  a  car parked  about \n200  feet  from  the  theater.  The  general  racial  situation \nwas  \"fairly tense.\"  We'd had  reports  of out-of-towners., \nThe  Department  had  dispersed  several  groups  around  the \n1-Tilby  on July 4.  vle  dispersed all  groups,  white  or colored. \nOn  July 5,  I  was  parked  500-600  feet  south of  the  en. .. \ntrance  to  the  Green Street Hall.  I  got  there  about  7:30p.m. \nLt.  Pyron was  with me.  I  had been  in the  vicinity of  other \nmass  meetings.  My  practice was  to  go  in an unmarked  car \nand  park  block away.  We  tried to have  a  trouble \none~half \ncar a  block behind  the  meeting  and  another on  the  block on \nthe  other side.  At  Green Street,  I  didn't  leave  the  car \nthat  evening.  I  couldn't  see  too well.  I  heard  something \nhit metal.  I  heard  someone  say,  \"They've  hit me  with a \nbrick.\"  Some  of the  deputies moved.  Tear  gas  hit me  pretty \nbad  and  I  had  to  ask  the Lieutenant  to  drive  me  away.  t-1e \nwent  back south,  then to  Franklin Street,  then  to  the  corner \nof Jeff Davis  and  Green Street.  I  couldn't  see  anything \nexcept  a  bunch  of cars  from  the  corner of  Jeff Davis  and \nGreen  Streets.  I  could  see  twenty  to  twenty-five deputies. \nI  stayed  in the  car for  ten to  fifteen minutes  and when \nthings  calmed  down  I  went  back  to headquarters. \nAfter July 3,  I  learned of  roCking  of cars.  Several \nwere  rocked  at Broad  and Small.  There's  a  traffic light \nthere.  Several  were  rocked on Lapsley between First Avenue \nand  the  tracks.  A  Police  Department  car was  rocked.  Sgt. \nGoodwin  was  in it;  I'm not  sure whether  Ellison was  in the \ncar.  Both  the  Lapsley area and  the Green Street area are \nNegro. \nB-39 \n\nROBERT  D.  CURTIS \n(Hhite) \nI  am  a  colonel in the Air Force.  I've been deputy \nwing  commander  at Craig since October  of  1963. \nOn  July 27  or 28,  1964,  there was  a  meeting of  Judge \nHare,  Sheriff  Clark,  i1r.  l1cLeod,  Col.  Ault  (wing commander), \nf.:Iajor  rtichardson  (security officer),  and  Bajor Ely  (in charge \nof  plans),  and myself.  The  meeting was  called by  the  county \nofficials;  I  think Sheriff Clark called it. \nAt  the meeting  the  county officials,  with  Judge  Hare \ntaking the  lead,  stated that  the  July  23,  1964 meeting of \nNegro  airmen at  the  Elks  Club violated  Judge  Hare's  injunc \ntion and  that  the  airmen were  subject to  arrest.  Judge \nHare  stated that Craig  airmen  \"could\" be  subject  to  the \ninjunction.  The  officials  said the airmen's  meeting dealt \nwith  the  loeal racial situation.  They  said the  Elks  Club \nwas  no  longer a  private place-,  --since  the meeting was  among \nnon-members  and  probably non-guests. \nI  don't  recall being informed  the  county had  tried to  -\nget  information from  the  airmen and  that every airman  inter \nviewed  refused  to  talk;  that  the only evidence  against  them \nwas  their taking  the Fifth Amendment.  My  impression was \nthat you  [Judge  Hare[  had  some  idea  of what  went  on  at  the \nmeeting. \nThe  officials  said they had  no  interest concerning our \ndomestic  affairs.  They  left us  free  to  investigate,  but  I \ndon't  recall any  assurances  of  non-intereference.  You  [speak \ning to  Judge  Hare]  noted  thltt ยท  our men  were  subject  to  F\"  โข โขโข ~ ~ โข \nโข!) \nsubpoena  or arrest. \nI  recall something being discussed about  the county \nstaying our of  the  Hathan Bedford Forest  Homes.  The  project \nare not  on  the base,  but  Colonel Ault  has  been  given control \nover  its occupancy.  It's desegregated now  and was  at the \ntime  of  the meeting. \nB-40 \n\nIZETTA  }iAULL \n(Negro) \nI  work  for Mr.  Kimbrough  in an office  in the  building \nin which  the  Elks  Club  is located.  I  heard  people  come \nupstairs,  looked  through  the  window  in the  door  and  saw \nseveral  uniformed  deputies.  Then  I  heard  sounds  as  if \nsomeone  were  knocking  out  a  door.  I  saw  no  one  in the \nhall  except  uniformeq  deputies. \nB-41 \n\nJAHES  C.  I<DiBROUGH \n(Negro) \nI'm a  letter carrier and  real estate broker.  On \nJuly 27,  196!โข,  I  finished carzyi1gยท  mail  and  went  to my \noffice at about  3:00 p.m.  It is  on  the  second floor \nof  the  building in which  the  Elks  Club  is  located.  On \nthe  second floor,  there  are  three  doors:  at the head \nof  the stc~rs is  one  leading upstairs  to  the  large rooms \nof  the  Elks  Club;  one  to  the  left leads  to my  office, \nand  one  to  the right  leads  to  the Elks'  \"Club  1170.\"  The \ndoor  to Club 1170 is usually closed,  but  that afternoon \nit was  open.  I  looked  to see  why  the  door  was  open  and \nsaw  some  deputies  standing  inside.  I  asked  if I  could  -\nhelp.  I  am  secretary of  the  Elks  Club,  and gave  permis \nsion  to use  the  phone.  Then Sheriff Clark;  the  steward, \nChestnut,  and  another officer came  with h~.  I  accompanied \nthem upstairs.  Chestnut  got  the ABC  license for  them and \nthey  left.  The  sheriff did not  state the grounds  for \nrevocation;  he  did not  say any  law was  violated.  The \nreason given was  \"orders  from higher authority.\"  The \nlicense was  returned about  a  week  later.  I  don't know  who \ngave  it to us. \nThe  lock to  the  Club 1170 door was  jammed  and  the \nElks  Club bad to replace  it. \nB-42 \n\nJ. L.  CHESTNUT,  SR. \n(Negro) \nI'm fifty-five  and  live  in Selma. \nI  am  the  bartender of  the  Elks  Club;  I've worked \nthere  three  years.  Only  the Exalted Ruler  and  I  have \nkeys  to  the Club,  and  the  doors  to  the  Club  and  the  1170 \nClub  are  kept  locked.  A  sign over  the  1170 Club  door  says \n\"Exclusive  1170\";  a  sign above  the  main  entrance  to  the \nElks  Club  says  '~tlembers Only.\"  ~~Je  sell liquor there. \nOne  afternoon  in July,  I  heard  that  the  sheriff was \nlooking  for me.  My  son who  is  a  lawyer  and  I  ran  into \nSheriff Clark on  the  corner of  Dallas  and  Broad,  and  I \nasked  the  sheriff  if he  wanted me;  the  sheriff said to \ncome  to  the  sheriff's  office.  My  son and  I  went  there \nand met  with Sheriff Clark,  Mr.  McLeod,  and  several  other \nofficers.  The  Sheriff  asked  about  the  \"meeting\".  I \nthought  he  meant  Elks meetings,  but he  said he  meant  the \nmeeting  of  airmen.  I  said  there  was  one.  I  told him  I \ndidn't know  what  the meeting was  about.  The  sheriff asked \nhow  they got  to have  the  meeting.  I  said  the  airmen had \nasked me,  and  I  asked  Nr.  Moss.  He  said  it was  all  right \nas  long  as  the  meeting  was  private.  l1cLeod  asked  if \nI  didn't know  that  the  white  man  at  the  meeting was  not \nan  airman;  I  said I  didn't know  - many  airmen were  in \ncivilian clothes.  They  took  a  statement  from me,  but  I \nnever  received  a  copy. \nThe  meeting had  be1en  orderly;  I  couldn't  see  or \nhear  it going  on. \nFrom  the  sheriff's office we  went  to  the  Elks  Club. \nSheriff Clark  asked  for  the  liquor license.  I  gave  him \nthe  federal  stamp  first,  but  he  said he  wanted  the  state \nlicense.  I  asked  if the Elks Club had  to  close.  He  said \nwe  could  stay open,  but  couldn't  serve  liquor.  Sheriff \nClark never complained  about  the  conduct  of  the  Elks  Club. \nHe  gave  no  reasons  for  the  taking  of the  license except \n\"orders  of higher authority\". \nThat  evening  some  deputies  came  back and  changed my \nstatement;  they  said  they had  left out  part  the  first time. \nTaking away  a  beer and  liquor license  seriously inter \nferes  with the  operation of an Elks Club,  all  right.  Our \nclub closed when  the  license was  taken. \nB-43 \n\nEI:UIN  L.  MOSS \n(Negro) \nI've lived  in Selma  all my  life,  forty  years.  I  am \npersonnel  director at  the  Father of St.  Edmunds;  I've \nworked  there  for  nineteen years.  I'm the Grand  District \nDeputy of  the  Elks. \nHhen  I  returned  to  Selma  from  a  trip on July 30,  1964, \nI  requested  a  meeting with Judge  Hare  to  find  out  how  our \nliquor license had  been violated.  He  granted  the  meeting \non August  3,  1964. \n..  At  the  meeting  I  was  asked  whether  I  knew  that  a \ncivil  rights meeting violated the  injunction;  I  said yes. \n[\nI  was  asked  if I  had  granted  the  request  for  a  meeting; \nI  said yes.  I  didn't  know  the  purpose  of  the  meeting; \nthe  club  frequently  allows  private meetings.  The  Club  is \na  private  club.  I  stated I  might  have  exceeded my  authority \nin allowing  the meeting.  The  officials at  the meeting with \nJudge  Hare  had  a  copy  of  our constitution.  It was  suggested \nthat  the Club  should  expel  the member  who  had  refused  to \n) talk,  but  I  said  I  couldn't  allow expulsion in the  absence \nof a  violation of the  Elks  Constitution. \nI  was  asked,  at my  meeting with Judge  Hare  and  others \nif I  knew  that  at  Green  Street  the  statement  was  made  that \nNegroes  should  go  out  and  rape  white  women.  I  was  also \nasked  about  statements  I  had made.  I  can't  remember  which \nstatements.  There  was  no  suggestion of  impropriety.  I \nnever urged  violence.  I  had  been  served with  the  injunc \ntion July 10. \nThe  license was  returned  to me. \nI  attended several  mass  meetings,  including one  in \nthe  spring of 1963  when James  Foreman  spoke.  I  wouldn't \nsay  the  speakers urged hitting  the  streets.  Most  of  the \nspeeches  were  on voter  registration. \nI  am  a  member  of the  Dallas  County  Improvement  Asso \nciation,  which  is composed  of ministers  and  most  business \nmen  from  the  community.  The  association tried to work \nthings  out  before  the  demonstrations.  It hasn't  operated \nmuch  since we  got  into  \"this business.\" \nB-44 \n\nGEORGE  HUDSON \n(Negro) \nI'm married;  I  've  lived  in Selma  seventeen years \nand  have  worked  a  year  and  five  months  at  the Cleveland \nTable  Company,  where  I  sand  tables. \nI  met  my  brother,  Peter,  at Eddie's  Cafe  about  mid \nday  on  July 7.  I  was  on  vacation from work.  He  went \nfrom  there  to  the  sidewalk by Miller's Funeral  Home,  a \ncommon  gathering  place  for  Negroes  in Selma.  I  don't \nknow where  the  SNCC  office  is.  I  haven't  heard of  CORE. \nMy  brother  told me  there  was  going  to be  some  picketing \nby  the  county courthouse,  so we  went  up  to watch.  About \na  half block toward  the  courthouse  we  met  a  third man, \nWalter Reeves,  who  went  to  the  courthou.se  with us.  I \ndidn't know  him.  We  didn't  talk much.  There  were  no \nchildren with us.  We  walked west  on Alabama Avenue  and \nstopped on  the  corner  across  the  street  from  the  court \nhouse.  I  was  \"right under  the  Standard Oil  sign\"  [see \nthird picture  on  second  page  of  pictures  for July 7  in \nPl.  Ex.  No.  14].  Two  boys  and  t'tvo  girls were  picketing \nin front  of  the  post  office building.  vJe  stood  there  and \nwatched.  After  the  pickets were  picked up,  we  turned \nback.  We  got  to the  corner of Broad  and Alabama,  where \nSheriff Crocker arrested us.  We  stayed  in  jail  a  week; \nno  one  from  the  sheriff's office  asked  us  what  we  had \nbeen doing.  Crocker didn't  tell us  what  we  were  arrested \nfor;  I  know we  were  arresยทted  for  interfering with  the  court. \nI  don't know  Claude  Nelson. \nI  had  a  switchblade knife  with me  that  day,  \"but  it \nwasn't  no  good,\"  and  the  blade  had  been broken. \nB-45 \n\nFLORENE  GOODHIH \n(Negro) \nI'm  thirty .. two;  I've always  lived in Selma.  I'm \nmarried,  but  separated;  I  have  one  child. \nI  attended  the  Green  Street meeting.  I  heard a \nspeaker sayt  If you go  to  a  restaurant  and  they  refuse  you, \njust turn  away.  Most  of  the  talk was  about voter regis-\ntration. \nOne  day  the  next week  I  went  to  register;  I  first \ntried to  get  into  the  registration  line  through  the  alley \nway  on  Church Street between Alabama  and  Selma Avenues. \nThere  were  two  possemen  at  the head  of  that  alley,  however, \nso  I  went  around  the block to  the  alley on  Lauderdale \nAvenue.  There  were  two  possemen  there,  also;  one  of  them \nturned me  away,  saying  I  couldn't get  through  there.  I \nnever  tried to  get  to  the  line from  in front  of the  court \nhouse.  There  were  quite  a  few  possemen  in front of the \ncourthouse,  and  only  a  few  on  the  sides.  No  one  told me \nthat  I  couldn't go  to  the  front  of  the  courthouse,  and  no \none  told me  that  I  could. \nโข \nB-46 \n\nGEORGIA  HENLEY \n(Negro) \nI  am  a  clerk-typist  at  the  Father  of St.  Edmunds. \nI've worked  there  nine  years,  I'm twenty-five. \nI  arrived at  the  courthouse  on  \\โข!ednesday,  during \nthe  l-leek  of  July 5  at  about  9:15  a.m.  I  got  number  10 \nand  stayed  at  the  courthouse  in the  line in the  back \nalley.  I  got  in to  apply  to  register about  two.  This \nwas  my  5th attempt  to  register. \nB~47 \n\nLORETTA  RILEY \n(Negro) \nI'm twenty-six;  I  live  in Selma. \nI  was  standing at  the  corner of Franklin and  Alabama \nwhen  I  heard  a  car with  a  siren and  followed  it to  see \nwhat  had happened.  I  knew  t J:ere  was  a  tense  situation  in \nSelma;  that  was  the  reason  I  followed  the  car.  I  was \nstanding by  the  flag  post when  the  singing  started;  soon \nafter that,  the  lawmen  came,  and  I  was  arrested.  No \nofficial  asked why  I  had  been arrested.  I  don1t  know \nClaude  Nelson. \nB-48 \n\nFREDERICK  REESE \n(Negro) \nI  was  born  in Selma.  I  teach  at Hudson  High  and  am \na  minister.  I  preach  at Macedonia  and Nt.

I  have  never  encouraged violence  against \nduly  elected  law  officials  of  Dallas  County  and  have  never \nencouraged  disregard  for  law  and  order.  I  have  heard no \nother  speaker  at  any mass  meeting  encourage  violence  againstยท \nlaw  officials  or  disregard  for  law  and  order. \nI  was  arrested July  7  after giving  a  lift to  three \nteenagers who  had  asked  for  a  ride.  I  was  going  home,  but \nwas  glad  to  them.  I  assumed  they were  going  to  picket, \nh~lp \nas  they held  signs.  I  don't know  whether  one  of  the  boys' \nnames  t-1as  Samuel l1e,v;ell\"  I  stayed  in jail a  part  of  four \n.days.  ยท \nI  was  served with  the State Court  injunction on  July \n10. \nB-49 \n\nSILAS  NORMAN \n(Negro) \nI'm from Augusta,  Georgia.

I  studied medical  microbiology at Atlanta \nUniversity for  a  year and  attended  the  University of \nWisconsin  for  a  year.  Since  the  latter part  of August, \nI've  been  a  staff member  for  SNCC.  The  outfit  I'm \nwearing  is similar to  one  many  members  of SNCC  wear. \nBefore August  1964,  I  was  not  associated with  SNCC. \nI  came  to Selma  in June,  to work with lames t,Jiley,  Karen \nHouse,  and  the  others. \nI  was  arrested by  Sheriff Clark  and  other men  from \nhis  department  at  the  Thirsty Boy  on  July 4,  1964,  and \nreleased  on July 11.  I  was  prodded  in the  left arm with \na  short  cattle  prod.  The  shock  was  quite  \"surprising\". \nI  was  prodded  on  the  way  out  of  the  Thirsty Boy,  into  a \ncar,  out  of  it, and  into  another  car.  Clark asked me  if \nI  had  tried to  kick him/~ยท ;  and  I  said no. \nThe  owner  of the  Thirsty Boy  did not  know my  name. \nNo  one  asked my  name  before  I  got  to  jail. \nI  attended  some  mass  meetings,  but  never spoke  at \nthem. \nB-50 \n\nLILLIE  YOUNG \n(Negro) \nI'm thirty-two;  my  husband  and  I  are  separated.  I \nhave  six children.  I've  been  in Selma  since  1962. \nMy  daughter,  Marjorie,  age  15,  was  arrested on  a \nTuesday.  I  tried to  see  her  once  in  jail,  but  was  not \nallowed  off  the  elevator.  I  didn't  see  a  sign about \nvisiting hours.  I  went  with my  daughter  to  see  Judge \nReynolds  two  or  three  days  after she  was  arrested.  There \nwas  a  lady  in the  office with  the  judge.  Judge  Reynolds \ninformed me,  \"You  aren't  to  call  yourself Mrs.  Young. \nYou  aren't  recognized  as  a  Mrs.  in this  office.\"  He  asked \nMarjorie  whether Amelia  Boynton had  put  her up  to  the \npicketing.  She  said no,  and he  sent  us  out  of  the  office \nfor 10 minutes,  admonishing Narjorie  to  tell  the  truth. \nAfter we  returned  to  the  office,  Judge  Steynolds  told \nMarjorie,  \"If you  don't  tell me  the  truth,  I'll send  you \nback  to  jail  for  60  days.\"  He  did  send  her back  to  jail, \n\"until  she  could come  up  with  the  right  answers\";  she \ngot  out  the  following  week.  I  did not  know  that my \ndaughter was  going  to  picket;  she  had  no  previous  record. \nI've  attended meetings  at the  churches.  I  haven't  heard \nanyone  advocate  picketing.  I  don't know  if SNCC  sponsored \nthe  meetings. \nB-51 \n\nRUTH  PORTER \n(Negro) \nI'm thirty-six;  I  have  six children.  I  work  for  a \nmanufacturing  company. \nI  went  with my  cousin,  Geraldine  Nitchell,  to  see \nJudge  Reynolds  on July lOe  Her mother had had  a  stroke. \nGeraldine  must  have  been  about  fourteen  then.  She  had \nbeen in  jail for  picketing before,  and  Judge Reynolds \nasked  her  this  time,  \"Remember  what  I  said before  if you \npicketed again?\"  Geraldine  answered,  \"Yes,  you'd  send \nme  to  reform  school.\"  Reynolds  said,  ''VJell,  that 1 s  just \nwhat  I'm going  to  do.\"  I  asked  Judge  Reynolds  how  long \nGeraldine  was  going  to be  in reform  school;  he  replied, \n\"Until  she  learns  how  to  obey the  law.\" \nI  guess  Geraldine  said,  \"All  these  people  are  in \njail,  and  I'm not.\" \nB-52 \n\nDONALD  DAVIS \n(White) \nI  work  for  United Press  International  in !ยทlontgomery. \nI  was  in Atlanta before  that.  I've  covered  quite  a  few \nsituations  involving  ra~ial difficulties. \nI  came  to Selma  on  July 5; tily  boss  at  the Nontgomery \noffice  told me  to  get  to Selma  as  soon as  I  could.  He \nsaid there was  a  racial  disturbance.  SNCC  calls us  fre \nquently;  'tve  check out  their calls.  Hhen  I  arrived,  about \nmidnight,  Selma  was  quiet.  No  one  was  at  the  sheriff's \noffice.  Later  in the  morning  the  next  day,  I  observed \nsome  pickets.  They were  stood  separately and  still,  for \nfive  to  fifteen minutes  before  they were  arrested.  Singers \nand  a  group  of Negroes  were  taken  into custody.  I  observed \ndeputies,  possemen,  some  state conservation officers,  and \nsome  state  troopers.  Deputies  cยทore  grey and  green,  while \npossemen  dress  in khakis.  vfuile . the  mass  arrest was  taking \nplace,  I  attempted  to make  a  phone  call  to my  office  from \nthe  booth  opposite  the  old  side  entrance  of  the  federal \nbuilding.  The  door  to  my  booth 'tvas  shoved  open,  and  a \nsheriff's deputy  told me  to  leave.  He  asked  if I  had  the \nsheriff's permission;  I  said I  thought  i.t  t-tas  unnecessary. \nHe  ignored my  press  credentials,  took  the  phone,  hung  it up, \nand  pushed me  outside.  I  saw  a  posseman  club  a  Negro. \nI  was  at  a  mass  meeting  at  the  Shiloh Church  that \nnight.  There  were  250  to  300  men  in uniform outside  the \nChurch.  They were  dressed  in khaki  and  had  helmets  and \nnightsticks.  The  possemen milled  about  the  Church,  shining \ntheir flashlights  in the windows  of  the  Church.  I  saw  one \nschool  bus  (which could carry thirty men)  at  the  Shiloh \nChurch and  several  cars  both official  and  private.  I  ob \nserved a  rock or some  other object  strike  an unmarked  car \nwith  officials  in it.  I  was  standing by  the  car when  it \nwas  hit.  I  didn't  see  any  blue  uniforms. \nOn  July  7,  I  observed  picketing.  some  deputies \n~Jhen \narrested a  small  boy  who  was  picketing,  one  of th~m said, \n\"He's  so  small  we  ought  to throw him back.\"  At  the  time \nof  the  arrests,  there was  an occasional  passerby,  but  no \ncrowd. \nThe  day  after I  came  to  town  the  pickets  stood on \nthe  steps  of this  [federal]  building. \nB-53 \n\nERNEST  DOYLE! \n(Negro) \nI've lived in Selma  twenty  years.  I'm first  vice \npresident  of the  Dallas County Voters'  League. \nOn  April  4,  1964,  I  went  to  the  courthouse  to vouch \nfor  Negro  applicants  for voter registration.  I  knew  a \nbout  six Negroes  in line  that  day  and  vouched  for  two. \nWhile  I  wasn't  vouching,  I  would  talk to  people  in line. \nI  was  not  told not  to  talk to  people  in line.  In  fact, \nI  saw  a  white  man  tell  another white  man  in line  to go  to \nthe  front  of the line  if he  wanted  to  get  registered.  The \nsheriff drove  me  from  the  area before  I  had  a  chance  to \nvouch  for  the  other four  Negroes  I  knew;  Annie \"\\tJilliam.s, \nRev.  M.  J.  Jackson,  I  believe,  ~1arie King,  I  believe,  and \nSally Gully,  I  believe.  I  wasn't  supposed  to  know  about \nWillie King's  sentence  for murder.  A voucher  vouches  for \nthe  applicant's name,  his  address,  and  how  long  the  voucher \nhas known  him. \nThe  Voters'  League  notified citizens of  the  mass \nmeetings  by  passing out  leaflets.  The  leaflets in exhibit \n22  are  the  type  of announcements  we  passed  out. \nAt  meetings  prior to  July 9,  there were  sheriff's men. \nThere  have  been no  meetings  of  the  Dallas County Voters' \nLeague  since July 9,  1964,  on account  of the  injunction. \nBefore  July 10  the League  printed a  flyer  for  a  July 13 \nmeeting,  but  that meeting was  never held.  I  don't  remember \nwhether  the  meeting  advertised for July 8  was  ever held. \nB-54 \n\nTHONAS  PiiRON \n(White) \nI've been  in the  Selma  police  department  twenty-three \nand  a  half years. \nI  was  driving Chief Mullen  in an unmarked  car at  ./,the \nA.H.E.  Hall  July 5.  ,. .J e  were  parked  about  100  or  200  yards \nsouth of  the  hall.  I  observed  a  lot  of  people,  several \nNegroes  and  20  to  25  possemen.  After  the meeting had \nbroken up,  I  heard  usomething  hit  something.\"  I  heard  a \ndeputy  say he 1d  been hit.  The  tear gas  got  bad,  so  I \ndrove  away  from  the  area and  went  to  the  corner of  Green \nStreet and  Jeff Davis. \nNo  affidavits were  executed  before me,  the  week  of \nJuly  5.  I  did not  issue  any  of the  warrants.  None  of  the \ndocuments  in plaintiff's exhibit  23  were  executed before \nme.  I  am  not  familiar with how  they were  executed.  No \none  requested  permission  from me  before  using  the  rubber \nstamp  with my  name  on  it.ยท  At  the  time  of  the mass  arrests, \nit was  common  practice  at  the  police  department  for others \nto use  my  rubber  stamp.  There  are  many  warrants  bearing \nmy  name  that  I  never  saw. \nB-55 \n\nJOHN  LOVE \n(Negro) \nI  was  born  in New  York City.  I'm twenty-four.  I've \nattended a  technical  school  and  have  a  year of college. \nI've worked  for  SNCC  for  a  little over  a  year. \nI  came  to Selma  in late May  or early June  1964.  At \nfirst,  I  was  to  do  a  voter  registration pamphlet.  Since \nJune  I've been project  director  in Selma. \nNost  of our 'to7ork  has  been  in attempting  to  get  people \nto  go  down  to  register.  \\Je 've  worked  some  on  registration \nitself. \nI  spoke  at  the Green  Street meeting.  I  was  aware  of \nthe  possemen  outside  and,  at the  end  of  the meeting,  I \nasked  the  people  to  go  home  quietly. \nI  was  arrested on  July 6.  The  picket  signs  that were \ndisplayed  said  \"Register  to  Vote\".  I  was  standing on the \nsteps.  The  pickets were  arrested,  and  someone  started to \nsing.  We  all  sang  and  the  sheriff  arrested us.  I  was  told \nat  the  end  of my  jail term that  I  had  been arrested for \ndemonstrating while  court  was  in session and  for  contribut \ning. \nThe  pickets were  minors.  They were  not  paid.  The \npickets were  contacted  in my  office.  I  said it was  impor \ntant  to have  children support  adults.  I  did not  carry a \nsign because  I  did not  think  it was  the  right  time.  At \nthe  Green Street meeting  I  did  not  tell  people  to  come  to \nmy  office.  I  told them  to  get  people  down  to  register, \nand  they came  to  the  office on  their own.  I  do  not  know \nwho  made  the  signs.  Some  non-minors  were  at  the office. \nOn  July 10  I  was  served an  injunction.  On  the  12th \na  regular deputy picked up  on  Jeff Davis,  just off Broad; \nit was  early in the  afternoon.  ''There  wasn't  any  crowd\" .. \nI  was  walking with  a  white  volunteer,  Eric  Farnum.  Mrs. \nBoynton's  daughter-in-law and  two  nieces waved  and  asked  if \nwe  would like  a  ride.  The  police  took  all  five  of us  into \ncustody. \nI  talked with  Chief  Deputy  Crocker.  Farnum  and  another \noยทfficer were  also  present.  Crocker gave  me  his  interpreta \ntion of  the  injunction.  He  said  it was  11broadly worded.\" \nHe  said he  thought  I  could be  arrested if I  were  seen with \ntwo  or more  other persons.  He  said  it could  even be  applied \nto gatherings  in r1y  h.o!ne.  He  said,  though,  that he  wasn't \ngoing  to  be  \"unreasonable,''  that  as  long  as we  behaved our \nselves;  it would be OK. \nThen we  were  taken back to where  we  were  picked up. \nThe  elapsed  time  was  about  thirty to  forty-five minutes. \nB-56 \n\nTHOMAS  BROWN \n(Negro) \nI  have  been with SNCC  for  two  years  and  southern \ncampus  co-ordinator for  6  months.  They pay me  now  and \ndid  in Selma.  I  live  in Atlanta,  Georgia.  I'm twenty \ntwo.  I  got  to my  senior year  in college;  I  attended \nBishop College  in Dallas  and  Butler University  in \nIndianap  ol is. \nI  was  in Selma  from  September 1963  through January \n1964  and  again  in July and August  of 1964.  I  was  project \ndirector  in September 1963.  I  was  arrested then,  but \nnot  in 1964.  In the  summer  of 1964,  I  came  to Selma \nJuly  2.  After John Love  was  arrested,  I  took  over as \nproject  director.  The  type  of projects we  had  include \nvoter registration drives,  literacy projects,  citizenship \nschools;  and  direct  action for  voter registration.  I \nworked  particularly with youngsters.  I  never  encouraged \nstudents  or others  to  commit  acts of  violence  against \nlaw  officers  or to  disregard  the  law.  I  attended approxi \nmately  twenty-three  or  twenty-four mass  meetings.  I  have \nbeen to Americus,  Georgia,  to St.  Augustine,  Florida,  to \nthe  States  of Mississippi,  Georgia,  and  Virginia.  I  was \nnot  in  St.  Augustine  at  the  time  of  civil  disturbances; \nI  was  there  just before  the  disturbances  arose. \nA newspaper  story attributing quotes  to me  concerning \nSelma was  inaccurate.  I  was  talking about Americus.  I \nmade  no  effort  to  correct  the  error. \nB-57 \n\nCHARLtS  JOHNSON \n(Negro) \nI'm 17,  a  student  at R.  B.  Hudson. \nI  was  arrested at  the  Federal Building  on  July 6. \nThat  is  the  only  time  I  have  been  arrested.  I  was  in  jail \nfor  10  days.  On  July 16,  in the  county  jail,  I  went  to -\nthe  fountain  to drink  some  water  and  Sheriff  Clark  appro \nched me.  Sheriff  Clark  stat-ted kicking me  and  said,  \"\"t-Jhat \nin the  hell  are  you doing  drinking from  our  fountain.\" \nJohnson backed  off  and  said,  \"I didn't know  I  wasn't \nsupposed  to use  it.\"  Sheriff Clark kicked me  first in my \nprivates  and  then in my  rectum. \nB-58 \n\nI-\nI \nJOHN  HENRY  SUTTLES \nI \n(Negro) \nI  was  arrested by  the  jail.  I  was  walking up  and \ndown  the  sidewalk on  the  Franklin Street side  of  the  jail, \ncarrying a  sign.  Joe  Smitherman also had  a  sign with him \nthere.  I  do  not  remember  what was  on  the sign.  I  got \nthe  sign \"to the  SNCC's  office;\" ยท[on cross]  I  went  to get it \nbecause  \"I wanted my  freedom.\"  I  don't know  whether  city \ncourt is held there.  The  city police  arrested me.  After \nI  was  arrested I  was  taken first to the city  jail,  then to \nthe  county  jail. ยท  I  was  released on a  Hednesday night, \nabout  a  week  after my  arrest. \nB-59 \nr \n\nhENNY  TUCKER \n(Negro) \nI'm  twenty-four.  I  work  in  Chambers  County  as  an \nagent  for  an  industrial implements  company.  I've been \nconnected with SNCC. \nIn  July,  1964,  SNCC  sent me  to  Hemphis,  Tennessee, \nto  pick up  a  Willys  Jeep which  had been  given  to  the \norganization  from California.  Hhen  I  picked up  the  car, \nit had  California license  plates  on  it.  Dinkley  Rumley \nof SNCC  sent me  a  Georgia license  plate which  I  put on  the \nrear.  I  was  told to  get Alabama  plates.  I  don't know \nwhether  the  car has  ever been  in either California or \nGeorgia~ \nI  knetv  it was  not  stolen,  because  I  had  the  receipt.  It \nwas  purchased  in  the name  of SNCC.  I  think Peter Hall has \nthe  receipt. \nI  drove  the  car to  Selma.  On  Franklin Street the  car \nwas  being  pushed  and  I  was  benind  the wheel when  Sheriff \nClark told me  to  pull over  and  show my  license.  I  do  have \nan Alabama  license.  Sheriff  Clark checked  the  tags  and \nthen  told me  I  was  under  arrest for  improper  tags.  The  car \nhad been  in Alabama  about  three hours  before  I  was  arrested. \nNeither Sheriff Clark nor any  of his men  questioned me  about \nthe  reason  for having  a  1964 Georgia plate on  the  back  and \na  1963  California plate  in  front.  I  was  in  jail for  two \nweeks. \nLast September,  Sheriff Clark grabbed me  when  I  was \nusing  the men's  rest room.  He  took me  to  Judge  Hare.  The \njudge  said,  \"You  think you're  in Chicago?  This  is Selma.\" \n\"I know,\"  I  answered.  Judge  Hare  then  said  I  was  under \narrest. \nB-60 \n\nNILDP..E!O  PARKER \n(i'legro) \nI  live  in Selma.  On  Honday,  July  6,  I  went  down \nto  the  courthouse  about  9  a.m.  I  went  to  the  door on \nLauderdale  Street.  A posseman  asked,  \"Hhat  are  you \ndoing?\"  I  said I  was  trying  to  register.  He  said that \nI  would  \"have  to  go  around  to  the  back.\"  I  went  to  the \nalley on  Lauderdale  Street  [seep.  B-46];  next  to  the \ngarage.  A posseman  there  told me  I  had  to  go  around  to \nthe Alabama  side of  the  courthouse.  I  did,  but did not \nget  in  to  register that day.  I  did get  in  to  apply  to \nregister on  the  following  day. \nB\"!\"6l \n\nJESSE'  LEWELlEN \n(White) \nI've  lived in Selma  forty-two  years.  I  served in \nthe Armed Forces  in France  and  Germany. \nIยท \nI  have  been  a  member  of  the  Dallas County  Sheriff's \nPosse  since  it was  organized.  I  had  no  previous  law \nenforcement experience.  I  am  not  now  a  member  of  the \nKu  Klux  Klan.  I  was  a  member  of  the  Klan  six or eight \nyears  ago.  There  is no  active Klan  chapter in  Dallas \nCounty  now  and  there  has  been  none  for  several years.  I \ndon't know  whether other  posse  members  were  in  the  Klan. \nThe  Sheriff did not  ask me  if I  had  ever been  a  member  of \nthe  Klan.  His  deputies  did not ask either.  Jack  Deramus, \nthe  head of the  posse,  asked me. \nDeramus  contacts  me  for posse work.  \"I don't haveยท \nthe  least idea\" where  he  works  or what  he  does.  I  served \nduring  the  July  4th weekend  at the  Wilby  Theater  and  at  the \nGreen  Street meeting.  I  also  served one  day  at the  court \nhouse  when  they were  picketing.  We  wore  uniforms  and  were \nequipped with side  arms,  sticks,  and helmets. \nHe  do  rescue  work  at floods.  In 196lยทwe  worked  around \nthe  clock to  help both Negroes  and  whites. \nWe've  had  instruction on  how  to  hold  sticks,  to  stay \nin groups ,  and  so  on. \nI  arrived  at Green  Street about  9:00 or 9:15  in  the \nbus.  Some  deputies  were  already  there.  'tJe  lined up  across \nthe  street.  There v1ere  about  35  or 40  possemen.  were \nl~Je \nwearing  unifonns  and  had  sidearms,  sticks,  and  helmets. \nThere  were  250  Negroes  in front of  the  hall.  The  meeting \nwas  still going on.  There  were  lights  on  in  the  hall and \none  small light on  outside  the  hall. \nOne  Negro  said over  and  over that he  had  a  machine  gun \nfrom  !~rea and  that he  was  going  to  go  home  and get  it and \nkill everybody. \nvlhen  the meeting ended  I  saw  the white  photographer. \nHe  went  behind  the  building..  Then  the  light went  out.  I \nheard  rocl's,  bricks or bottles hitting the  automobiles. \nThere  were  four  or five  at first,  then  there were  quite  a \nfew  of  them.  Chief  Crocker  told us  to move  in  and  break \nit up.  tve  \"just told them  to  go  home.\"  I  went  in  toward \nthe  church and  ste.yed  around  the  church.  I  do  not know  how \nfar  from  the  church  any  of the  other possemen  went. \nB-62 ยท \n\nThere was  lots  of noise.  It was  all over  in  just \na  few  minutes.  I  did not  hear1 a  shot  fired. \nThe  white  photographers  came  around  the  building \nand  sat down.  Someone  told them  to  go  home  and  they got \nup  and  left.  I. was  about  as  far  from  them  as  from here \nto you  (witness  stand to  counsel  table).  They  did not \nappear  to  be hurt.  I  did not  see  them  get  injured and \ndid not break their  I  did not \nphoto~raphic equipment~ \nbeat any  Negroes  and  did not  see  any  Negroes  abused.  I \ndid not  see  any  posse members  get hurt. \nB-62-b \n\nJESSE \nS~ITTH \n(White) \nI  am  from  Selma  and  I  am  a  member  of  the Sheriff's \nWater Pcsse.  I  have  received instruction from  Sheriff \nClark on  how  to  get  people  out  of  the  river when  they \ndrown.  We  were  also  instructed that  when  there was  trouble \nto disperse  it,  regardless  of where  it comes  from.  At  the \nflood  we  hauled  out  2500  Negroes.  I  was  called  in July, \nbut  I  was  not  at  the Wilby  and  was  not  at  Green Street.  I \nwas  at  the  courthouse  in the grand  jury room  on July 6. \nI  attended  a  meeting  at which Mr.  McLeod  spoke  about  integra \ntion,  but  I  deยท not  recall his  saying  \"we  must  meet  force  with \nforce.  The  day of  passive  resistence  is past.\"  I  am  not  a \nmember  of the Ku  Klux Klan  or  the States Rights  Party. \nB-63 \n\nCLIFTON  PRESSLEY \n(vJhite) \nยทI live in Selma;  I've always  lived in Dallas  County. \nI'm a  carman  for  the Southern Railway.  I  was  in the navy \nsix to  eight months. \nI  have  been a  member  of  the Sheriff's posse  from  one \nand  a  half to  two  years.  I  am  not  a  member  of  the Ku  Klux \nKlan.  The  Sheriff has  instructed us  to  \"keep  the peace  on \nboth  sides,\" to  remain  \"as  calm  as  we  can.\"  He  has  told \nus  how  to  protect ourselves  in case there  is a  riot.  I  have \nnever  received any  instruction in the use  of  tear gas.  As \npart  of my  duties  I  have  patrolled four  or  five meetings. \nWe  were  on  standby for  each meeting.  I  was  not  at  the Wilby \nor at the Shiloh Church,  but  I  was  at Green Street.  I  went \nto  the A.M.E.  Hall  on  the  bus  at about  9:00.  There were \n30  or 40  posse members  there.  I  had  a  bad back  so  I  stayed \non the  bus  which was  across  the street  from  the hall.  I \nstayed on  the  bus  until the  tear gas  ran me  out.  I  did not \nhave  a  clear view.  There  were  about  150  to  200  Negroes. \nThe  light outside  the hall was  on  for  a  while~  The  Negroes \n\"come  out  peaceful  as  you want  'em\"  and  started dispersing. \nAll  of  a  sudden there came  rocks  and  bricks.  It sounded \nlike thunder.  The  rocks  1;-1ere  coming  from  the  area around \nthe  alley next  to  the  church.  Then  the  tear gas  was  used. \nAfter it was  all over  I  saw the two  white  photographers  in \na  car.  Someone  had helped  them  into  the  car.  I  did not \nsee  the  sheriff talk to them.  I  did not  see  any  possemen \nabuse  a  Negro.  On  the way  back  in the  bus  nothing was  said \nabout  the  photographers  being  hurt  that  night.  He  did talk \nabout  who  they might  be. \nB-64 \n\nJAMES  HARRIS \n(White) \nI'm forty-two  and  live  at  Route  four.  I  went  to \nthe  eighth grade;  I  own  a  company. \nI 1ve  been a  member  of the  Sheriff's  Hater Posse \never since  it was  started.  I  have  had  no  police  train \ning.  I  have  never had  to use  weapons  in connection with \nmy  posse work,  but  I  have  been  shown  how  to use  them by \nmembers  of  the  posse.  No  one  e~:ยทse showed  me  how  to use \nthem.  I  have  had  no  training  in the  use  of  gas.  The \npurpose  of the  water  posse  is  to  help out  in drownings. \nDuring  the  flood  we  handled both  races.  We  removed  Negroes \nfrom  flooded  areas  and  provided  them with  food.  I  was  a \nmember  of  the Ku  Klux  Klan  about  ten years  ago.  I  didn't \nlike  it so  I  quit  after about  a  month.  During  July I  was \non  duty at Green Street;  I  was  not  on duty at  the  court \nhouse,  at  the Wilby,  or at  the  Shiloh Church.  We  wear  a \ngrey uniform and  carry a  badge,  a  gun,  and  a  stick and wear \na  helmet. \nI  went  to  the  Green  Street  Church  in the  bus  with \nabout  40  or 45  possemen.  Mr.  Crocker  was  in charge.  I \nnever  did  get  right up  next  to  the  church.  I  was  about \none-half block away.  I  did not  see  the  two  white  photo \ngraphers.  I  heard  about  their presence  there,  but  I  did \nnot  hear of  any  injuries  to  them.  I  rode  back in a  car. \nThere  were  four  or  five  bricks  thrown  in the  street \nor  thrown  at us.  After  the lights went  out  a  lot of  rocks \nwere  thrown.  I  did not  see  any  posse  members  hit  or abuse \nNegroes.  After  it was  over I  saw  Sheriff Clark.  I  did \nnot  hear a  shot. \nB-65 \n\nALVERY  WILLIAMS \n(Negro) \nI'm twenty-two;  I'm from  Gadsden,  Alabama.  I'm a \nsophomore  at Alabama A&M.  I  was  a  SNCC  worker  for  one \nand  a  half years.  I  worked  in Selma  in September  of \n1963.  I  was  here  in July 1964  as  a  SNCC  employee,  work \ning  on voter registration. \nI  went  to  the  Wilby Theater  between  5  and  5:30  on \nJuly 4.  There  were  a  lot of  Negro  kids  in front  of the \ntheater.  I  went  across  Broad  Street  and  saw  some  kids \nwho  wanted  to go  to  the movie.  Charles  Robertson went \non  in. \nThree  whites were  standing outside  the  theater. \nOne  of  them had  a  knife  and  advanced  toward  the  crowd. \nSheriff Clark pulled up and  got  out  and  dispersed  the \ncrowd.  Before  that,  I  asked  Sheriff Clark whether he \nsaw  that.  He  asked  if I  would  swear out  a  warrant.  I \ncouldn't  because  I  didn't know  the whites.  Deputy  Stokes \nand  Clark got  out  swinging  their sticks.  One  swung  at \nme,  but  I  got  away.  Later that  day,  I  was  charged with \ndisturbing  the  peace.  Several  days  later, Clark charged \nme  with  inciting to  riot.  I  was  in  jail about  two  weeks. \nI  did  not  ask ยทpeople  to  go  to  the  theater.  The  boy \nwho  came  with me  wanted  to  go  to  the  movie.  I  went  over \nto  see  the  children because  I  wanted  to  talk with  them. \nI  said nothing  about  the  picture  to  them.  I  had  about \nfour  or  five  kids  with me  canvassing  that  day;  most  were \nminors.  We  went  to  the  Freedom House.  lโขTe  parked  at  Jeff \nDavis  and  walked.  One  grownup  was  with me,  Charles  Robertson. \nI  wanted  to go  to  the  movie,  but  never got  in. \nB-66 \n\nCARL  GABEL \n(White) \nI  have  been with the  Department  of  Justice  for  three \nyears  in  the  Civil  Rights  Division.  I  supervised  the \nanalysis  of voter  registration records  in Dallas County \nand  compiled  statistics as  to  accepted  and  rejected \napplications by race.  I  have  had  this  type  of  assignment \nseveral  times.  If a  person applied to  register more  than \nonce  during  the  period covered by  the  statistics I  compiled, \neach of his  applications  is  reflected in the  statistics. \nB-67 \n\nJAMES  CLARK \n, \n(White) \n[Upon  being  asked  whether  p.ll of what  is now  Pl.

I \nattend Selma University. \nI  was  arrested in September  of  1963  and  put  in  jail \nfor  unlawful  assembly.  I  had been standing  at  the  old \nPost  Office watching  other students  picket  at the  time  of \nmy  arrest.  [On  Cross]  I  had gone  downtown  after  \"we  made \nour minds  up  because  of  the  treatment  our  people was \ngetting.tt  For  example,  a  friend  of mine  was  hit in the \nhead  at  Carter Drug.  I  do  not know  why,  of my  own  knowledge. \nSome  other  students  and  I  had  talked about demon \nstrating among  ourselves.  We  had decided  to  demonstrate, \nand  then  talk to  some  SNCC  people  and  attend mass  meetings \nto  find  out how  to  protest.  t~en I  was  arrested  I  knew \nsome  of  the  SNCC  people  in the  high school,  but  I  did not \nknow  the  officials. \nAfter  I  was  arrested and  put  in  jail in September \n1963,  I. was  brought  to  the  courthouse  one  night.  Judge \nHare  was  there,  as  well  as  another  person  I  thought was \nJudge  Reynolds.  There  [indicating]  is Judge  Hare,  but  I \ndon't  recognize  Judge Reynolds.  Sheriff Clark was  at \nthe  meeting;  Dr,;  Owens  was  also at  the  meeting.  There -- \nwere  others  I  did not recognize.  A  judge  asked  the \nstu~ \ndents  if we  wanted  to  go  back to school.  I  signed a \npaper,  and  the  judge  explained  that we  were  on  a  year's \nprobation and  if we  were  at any  mass  meetings,  we  would  be \ngiven  three months  hard  labor.  I  was  let out  of  jail and \nallowed  to go  back  to  school;  my  probation was  for  a  year, \nnot  for  nine  months.  I  do  not know  who  stated that  the \nprobation would  be  for  a  year,  but  I  was  informed  that  the \nman  wasยท a  judge.  I  did go  back  to  school  and have  not \nbeen  threatened  since. \nI  talked to  2 white  persons  prior  to  testifying. \nI  also  talked  to :Alvery  'Hilliams  in the  hall prior  to \ntestifying,  but  did  not discuss  the  case. \nB-69 \n\nOEFENDANTS 1  \"'liTNESSES \n\n-\nยท. \ndEORG}:  STOVES \n(\\tJhite) \n[I  am  assistant  chief deputy  to  Sheriff Clark;  see \nStoves  prior testimony,  p.

The  speaker was  Bob  Smith  of Mobile. \nAbout  thirty to  for.ty  or more  were  present.  Smith  said \nthere would  be more  Negro  meetings,  and  asked  the men  to \nuse  theiiโข guns  --- \"blazing and  shooting.\"  Smith  advocated \nviolence.  Only whites  were  at  the  meeting. \nSelma was  \"very tense\"  from  June  to  July 9,  1964; \nfeeling  ran high among  Negroes  and  white  people.  Relations \nbetween the  races  had  deteriorated  since last  fall. \nI  attended mass  meetings  in the  spring of  1964  with \nstate  investigator Rufus  Head,  with  whom  I  work  closely. \nI  prepared the  report  on  the  June  1,  1964 meeting  and \nprobably prepared  the  report  on  the  June  8  meeting.  At \na  meeting  at  the  First  Baptist  Church  Negro  ministers \nasked me  not  to  come  in.  \"'-Je  did  not  go  in.''  I  also \nattended  a  meeting  itrMarengo County  on  June  21,  1964. \nAt  one  meeting  Rev.  Anderson  gave  a  speech  about  a \nNegro  woman  on  a  city bus  who  was  asked  to go  to  the  rear. \nAnderson  said he  was  ready  to go  to  hell  to  keep  from \nletting Negro  women  be  pushed  around.  At  the  July 6,  1964 \nmeeting  Rev.  Abernathy  said  they would  ''bury  segregation.\" \nThere  was  no  violence  at  the meeting,  but  on  the way  home \nI  heard  a  radio  report  of  some  rock  throwing. \nI  don't  recall whether  I  attended  any meeting between \nJune  21,  1964,  and  July  S,  1964.  ยท \nRu~us Head  and  I  attended  the  Green Street meeting. \nc. \nWillie  Robertson  said that  since  the  Civil  Rights Act \nhad  passed we  can do  anything we  want  to  now;  we  don't \nhave  to  go  out  and  rape  white  women.  Then  there  was  a  lot \nof  jumping up and  dm11n,  and  a  stove  pipe  fell.  \"They \nwere  singing their violent  songs  when  I  left the  meeting.\" \nHead  and  I  were  parked a  little south of  the  hall  on \nthe  same  side  of the  street as  the  hall.  I  heard  a  rock \nhit  the  car,  got  out  and  picked  it up  from  near  the \n~ront \nof  the  car for  ev;idence,  and  then got  back  in the  car. \nHead  was  still in the  car  and  the  radio was  still working. \nA short  time  later several more  rocks  came.  I  got  out  and \npicked up  a  rock  right beside  the  car.  Then  I  heard  a  shot \nand  there  was  a  barrage  of  rocks.  The  lights went  out  and \nthen Crocker,  who  was  in charge,  ordered  the  crowd  dispersed. \nC-1 \n\nCrocker  did not  have  a  megaphone  and  gave  no  instructions \nto  the  crowd.  The  tear gas  was  heavy,  but  I  helped  dis \nperse  the  crowd. \nI  saw  the  two  photographers  twice;  once  when  I  came \nout  of  the  hall  and  later,  one  was  lying and  one  sitting \non  the  ground. \nThere  were  about  forty men  from  the, sheriff's depart \nment  there.  I  belieye  the  sheriff's office had  five  cars \nat  that  time  (all  radio-equipped),  of which  four were  at \nthe  hall  that  night.  There  was  also  a  school-type  bus \n(not  radio-equipped).

I  cover  Dallas,  Perry,  Hilcox,  Sumter,  and \nNarengo Counties. \nOn  June  20,  1964,  as  a  part  of my  duties,  I  attended \na  meeting  of  the  National  States  Rights  Party  in a  pasture \noff Highway  80.  Attendance  was  about  twenty-five.  A \nBob  Smith  of Hobile  spoke  of  violence  and wanted white \npeople  to  get  together  and when  Negroes  start marching, \nwalk  all  over  them.  Smith wanted  to  form  an army  like \nthey had  in Hississippi and  spoke  of  a  million Jews  and \nNegroes  floating  down  the  Hississippi River.  Smith  re \nferred  to  the  Bible  as  proving white  men  Hould  win. \nSmith wanted  a  committee  of ten,  each to  call  three,  and \nasked  for  an army  of 1500.  He  said demonstrations  t..rere \ncoming  and  they  should  get  guns  and  keep  \"both barrels \nblazing\".  Edward  Fields was  introduced  as  field director. \nAt  the  June  1,  meeting  of  Negroes  at  the  Mt. \n196!~ \nArarat  Baptist Church  about  250  Negroes  were  present. \nL.  L.  Anderson,  \"Be  prepared.  I'm  ready  to  go  to hell  rather \nthan have  our women  pushed  around. \"  There  was  a  lot  of \nsinging  and clapping. \nI  attended  the mass  meeting  on July  6,  1964  at which \nRev.  Abernathy  spoke  and  said he  was  th.ere  to help  \"bury \nsegregation.\"  The  church was  full.  I  understand  two  or \nthree  rocks  were  thrown  after  I  left. \nI  attended Negro  meetings  when  requested by  the  Depart \nment  of Public Safety.  I  have  a  sheriff's deputy with me \nat  all  times.  I  report  on  all meetings;  Deputy  Stoves  has \nhelped me  prepare  my  reports.  t-Je  take  no  notes.  Possemen \nhave  been outside  some  of the  meetings.  The  purpose  of the \nposse  is  the  \"protection of  the  people.\" \nI  was  in Birmingham  in the  summer  of 1963  and  can \ncompare  that  situation 'Iilith  Selma  from  July 1-6,  1964. \nIn Selma  \"it was  an  explosive  situation.\"  There  tvere \nmany  outsiders  in Selma.  Selma  faced  a  chance  of almost \na  complete  breakdown  of law and  order.  I  don't  remember \nwhether  I  lvas  here  after July 6;  my  judgment  is  based on \n'liJhat  I  sa't-1  through  July 6. \nI  was  present  when  the  complaint  for  the  injunction \nwas  filed,  and  I  provided  information  for  the  complaint. \nI  took  affidavits  from  John Harren,  Ruby  Allen,  George  M. \nv. \nCorson,  James  Jones,  George  King,  and Pete Holfe. \nDeputy Stoves  assisted me.  He  took  the  other affidavits \nin the  exhibit  [Def.  Ex.  No.  12].  I  don't  remember  when \nI  took Parren's  affidavit.  I  don't  remember  if it was \nright  after  the Thirsty Boy. \nC-2  . \n\nOn  July 4,  1964,  I  was  in the  sheriff's office \nwhen  he  got  the  call about  the  Doy. \nThirct~/  CL:-.1\"~:: \n~nd I  filmnedic!. tely ~:en'c  to  th-0.  Thirsty Boy.  Deputieยทsยท \nHewston and  Bates  were  there.  I  saw  Clark and  Hewston \ntalk to the  owner,  but  couldn't hear  the  conversation \nsince  I  stayed outside.  Someone  had warrants.  Clark \ncame  out  with  the  four  Negroes.  I  did not  see  anyone \nabuse  the  Negroes  in any way  from  the  time  they came \nout  of the  Thirsty Boy  until  they were  put  in the  car. \nI  then  returned  to the  courthouse;  I  did not  go  with  the \nothers  to  the  jail. \nAfter I  returned  to  the  courthouse  from  the  Thirsty \nBoy,  I  drove  around  for a  couple  of hours.  Then  Sheriff \nClark and  I  were  \"just  patrolling around''  and  observed \nfm:ยทt~r.  to  fifty Negroes,  ati.d  five  or six white  boys  around \nthe  vJilby Theater.  'VJe  arrived  first,  before  any  possemen. \nThere  were  white  people  sitting on their parked  cars. \nThere  't'lere  twenty to  thirty white  people  on  the  Carter Drug \ncorner  and  fifteen or  twenty people,  both Negro  and  white, \nat  the Woolworth  corner.  I  did not  know,  when  we  got  to \nthe vJilby,  that  there  were  Negroes  inside.  Alvery Williams \nstopped us  in the  street.  We  were  headed  east,  toward  the \nSilver Moon  Cafe.  Williams  said  that white  people  were \ncreating a  disturbance  and  he  wanted  them  arrested.  Clark \nasked Williams  to  sign a  warrant,  but  said no. \n~,Jilliams \nWilliams  then turned  and  said  something  to  the  crowd, \nwhich  began whooping  and  hollering.  Clark and  I  told \neveryone,  \"the white  and  the  colored,\"  to leave.  We \ndispersed  the  crowd;  we  removed  white  people  in front  of \nl.Jilby.  We  dispersed crowds  \"all  over  town.\"  I  didn't \nsee  anyone  hit.  Clark and  I  left together. \nI  was  aware  the Civil  Rights  Act  applied to  the Wilby. \nI  assumed  there  had  been  segregated seating  there  before. \nDeputy Stoves  and  I  went  inside  the  building  to attend \nthe  Green Street meeting.  We  arrived before  any  other \nmembers  of  the  sheriff's department.  A:t  first  there were \nfifty to  seventy-five  Negroes  there.  Later the  crowd  grew \nto  250-300.  At  the  meeting  there  was  jumping  up and down, \nnoise,  freedom  songs;  a  stove  pipe  fell  down.  Willie c. \nRobinson,  a  speaker  at the  meeting,  said,  they accuse  us \nof  raping  white  women,  but  \"you  don't  have  to  rape  a  white \nwoman.\"  I  don't  recall  any  recess  in the  meeting.  Stoves \nand  I  left during  the  singing.  The  meeting  broke  up  around \n9:30. \nCrocker  told us  all had  been quiet,  except  that  a  few \nrocks  had  been thrown.  I  started my  car when  a  barrage  of \nrocks  came  and  several  rocks  hit my  car.  [Defendants  Ex. \nNo.  6F]  shows  the  damage  to my  car.  Crocker ordered tear \ngas  fired.  I  went  to my  car  trunk and  got  out  my  gas mask. \nI  called the  highway  patrol  station to  contact  Col.  Lingo \nand  Sheriff Clark.  I  didn't know  where  Colonel  Lingo  was. \nC-2-b \n\nI  called station 27  because  it's the  only State Trooper \noutfit  in  the  area.  Stoves  and  I  got  out  of  the  car after \nthe  barrage  and,  with  Crocker,  recovered  two  rocks.  [Def. \nEx.  No.  6B]is  a  picture  of the  rock  that  hit my  automobile \n[Def.  Ex.  No.  7].  Defendants  Ex.  No.  6A  is  a  picture  of \nDef.  Ex.

After \nthe  tear gas  was  fired  I  sawยท one  of them lying on  the \nground  and  one  squatting.  Iยทtook off my  gas  identi \nmas~, \nfied myself  as  a  state  investigator and  asked  the  blond \nman  what  happened.  \"I  don't know;  as  I  came  out  of  the \nchurch,  a  Negro  grabbed me.\"  The  other said he  had  lost \nhis glasses.  Crocker offered to  get  them medical  attention, \nbut  they  siad  they didn't  need  it.  Some  possemen were \nstanding around  the  two men.  I  did not  see  possemen  throw \nthe  camera  against  a  wall.  I  didn't  see  anyone  abuse  the \ntwo  men. \nAfter  the meeting  I  made  a  handwritten  affidavit \n[Pl.  Ex.  No.  35].  I  made  it at  the  courthouse.  I  don't \nremember when.  If it's dated  July  5,  that must  be  right. \nI  think Mr.  Pitts may  have  been  there.  I  don't  recall \nmru<ing  or  swearing  to  this  typewritten affidavit  [Pl.  Ex. \nNo.  36].  The  two  affidavits  are  the  same. \nI  make  written reports  on all my  investigations.  I \nmade  one  on  the  Green Street meeting.  I  thought  I  brought \nit in,  but  it is not  here.  I'll check  for  it this  evening. \nC-2-c \n\nLEONARD  Q~OCI<Eg \n(vfuite) \n[I  am  Sheriff Clark'sยท chief deputy;  see  summary  of \nhis  prior testimony,  p.  B-29]. \nI  attended  a  meeting  of  the  National States  Rights \nParty with Rufus  Head,  Stoves,  and Nichols.  Bob  Smith \nfrom  Hobile  spoke.  He  encouraged whites  to  meet  Negroes \nin  the  streets,  to meet  them not with the  butts of  their \nrifles  firstt  but with  the barrels  first and  with  \"both \nbarrels blaz~ng.\"  He  said there  were  60,000 men  ready  to \ndo  this  in Hississippi. \nThere  were  about  ten  lawmen  present when  I  arrived at \nthe A.H.E.  hall.  Head  and  Stoves were  there,  but were \ninside  the meeting.  There  was  a  brief recess  about  ten or \nfifteen  minutes  after I  arrived.  The  meeting  broke  up  at \n9:30 or 9:45.  The  Negroes  were milling  around,  chanting. \nI  was  standing by my  car,  which was  directly opposite  the \nchurch.  The  deputies  and  possemen  were  lined up  on  that \nside.  Head's  car was  on  the  side of the  street where  the \nmeeting  hall was.  Two  white  men  came  out.  I  had  seen  them \nearlier,  either that day  or the  day  before.  At  that  I \nt~e \nhad  asked  for  information,  which  they  provided.  My  reason \nfor  seeking  information had been  the  Philadelphia,  l:Iissis \nsippi incident  and  the  fact  that  feelings  were  running  high \nin  Selma.  Nyonly  thought  had  been  that  if anything \nhappened  to  the men,  the  sheriff's office  could  care  for \nthem better if it had  the  information.  It is my  handwriting \nthat  appears  on  plaintiff's exhibit 11  and  12.  There  is \nnothing  out of the  ordinary  for  those  men  to  talk with me. \nI  probably  couldn't even  recognize  them now.  When  the  first \npeople  came  out of  the meeting hall;  they went  straight to \nan  alley  just south of  the  Green  Street hall and  across  the \nstreet.  Almost  immediately,  bricks  and  other missiles \nbegan  flying.  It was  a  minute  or more  later that  I  gave  the \norder  to  disperse  the  crowd.  1-:ieanwhile,  I  had  heard what \nsounded  like  a  muffled shot  and  then  barrage of objects. \nI  noticed  the  photographer  trying  to  focus  his  camera. \nMost  of  the  Negroes  ran  toward  the  two  white u..ewsmen.  Later \nI  saw  two  bodies  on  the  ground.  I  said nothing  at that  time \nto  them,  but  asked  an  officer near  them whether  they  needed \nmedical  help.  I  gave  orders  that  if the  men  did  need help \nto  let me  know.  I  never  saw  any  posseman or deputy  abuse \nthe  newsmen.  I  never  saw  any  posseman  strike  a  Negro.  I \nsaw HcLeod  at the  scene,  but  do  not remember  any  conversation \nbetween ยฃ:1cLeod  and  the  newsmen.  After  things  had  quieted \ndown  sometV'hat,  six to  eight men  in  groups  patrolled the \nimmediate  area,  to  be  sure  crowds  had  broken  up.  This  type \nof  patrolling went  on  from  forty-five minutes  to  an  hour. \nDuring  this  time,  we  picked up  stones  [Def.  Ex.  Nos.  7  and  8]. \nC-3 \n\nGreen  Street  is  an  ordinary unpaved  dirt street, \nwith  no  rocks  in  the  street.  ~r7e  made  no  reconnaisance \nbefore  the meeting.  I  went back to  the  courthouse  at \nabout  11:30.  Head was  there  at that  time.  I  do  not \nremember  how  long  I  stayed.  I  gave  two  affidavits \n[Def.  Ex.

I  didn't\\notice  any  whites.  There \nwere  spectators  across  the  strยขet:near  the  newsstand;  I \ndon't know  about  Carter corner' orยท the Woolworth  corner. \n. '\\  \nHrs.  Oliver said,  \"l:Irs.  M9ore:;  I  surely  am  glad  to \nsee  you.  She  had  a  lot of  strairi:. selling  tickets  to \ntt \nNegroes  on  the  white  side,  I  ~olcl' some tickets  to  Negroes. \nTwo  Negroes  bought  tickets,  bup  did not  go  into  the  theater. \nThey  had been  brought up  to  thยข  win.dow  by  another  colored \nperson  and  they  stayed outsideยท,;:with; him.

Two  whites  left \nwhen  they  heard Negroes  were  inside.  One  white  man  came  up \nand  told  the  two  Negroes  who  h~d bought  tickets  that  they \nwere  not going  in.  The  boy whf}ยทhad  been bringing  kids  up \nto  the  theater had  a  heated 4iยงcussion with  the white man, \nthen  the  two  Negroes  came  back.  Nr.

I  noticed Sheriff \nClark :drive up;  Iยทc:lon't  remember  se.eing  any  Negro  talk to  Clark \nPrior  to  this  time;  Ihadurged Butler  to  call  the  police. \nButler said he  was  fixing  to  do  that.  I  was  afraid  there \nwas  going  to  be  a  fight..  I  believe  that Clark tried to \ndisperse  the  ~rowd,  after which  he  went  into  Butler's office. \nAfter the  Negroes  came  out,  I  think,  which was  after the  crowd \nwas  dispersedt  Hr.  Butler and Sheriff  Clark talked.  Hr. \nButler  told me  Sheriff Clark had  advised him  to  close.  He \nsaid to  finish  the  film  that was  on,  then  to  quit. \nC-4 \n\nDOROTHY  OLIVER \n(White) \nI'm nineteen;  I  work  as  a  cashier at  the V.Tilby \nTheater. \nI  t'lorked  from  1:15  to  5:30  p.m.  at  the  Theater \n'~'-7ilby \non  July 4,  1964.  Hrs.  Hoore  relieved me.  I  opened  the \nbox  office at 1:45 or 1:50.  There was  a  big  crowd of white \nand  colored  outside,  more  colored  than white.  I  did not \nsell any  tickets  to Negroes  in the white  section until  the \nNegro  balcony was  filled.  The  Negroes  were  children and \nteen-agers  up  to  the  age  of  twenty-seven.  I  did not  see  any \nolder Negroes  bring others  up  to  the  tiGket  window.  After \nthe  Negro  balcony was  filled,  I  started selling tickets  on \nthe white  side.  The  first  tickets were  sold  about  4  p.m. \nI  saw  about  fifteen  or  twenty Negroes  on  the  grass  at Mrs. \nAdams'  house  next  to  theยท theater.  I  didn't  see  any whites \ntry to obstruct Negroes  attempting  to enter the  theater. \nI  saw  several  police  cars  go  by  the  theater  \"from \ntime  to  time.\"  They were  city police  cars.  I  did not  notice \nany  sheriff's  cars  or  possemen. \nI  talked once  to  the  FBI,  a  couple  of days  later. \nC-5 \n\nROGER \nB~ER \n(\\ยท1hite) \nI'm  the  manager  of the l,Jilby Theater. \nThe  theater opened  at  about  1:45  on July 4,  1964. \nI  arrived about  10  a.m.  No  one  was  waiting  to  get  in at \nthat  time.  At  opening  time,  sizable  lines had  been  formed \nat  the  colored  and  white  ticket  windows.  The  lines were \norderly.  The  second  balcony  filled about  an hour  after \nthe  opening  of  the  theater.  After  that,  most  of the  per \nsons waiting to1ere  Negro  youngsters.  No  Negroes  tried to \nbuy  any  tickets  for  the  white  section at  that  time,  they \ndid  not  start until  about  5:30.  At  about  5:30  (4:30?] \n., \nI  asked  if any  Negroes  wanted  to  test now.  They  said, \n\"Yes.\"  I  suggested  that  they come  back  when  the  situation \nwas  less  explosive,  but  the  Negroes  wanted  to  go  ahead. \nI  said OK,  and  sold  tickets  to  about  seventeen Negroes. \nThe  crowd  was  milling around.  There  were  a  few  whites \nacross  the  street  and  a  lot of whites  on Carter corner. \nThere  were  a  few  in front  of  the  theater.  There  were  some \nroughly-dressed,  rough-looking  characters. \nAt  3  o'clock,  or 3:30p.m.,  across  the  street  in front \nof  the  finance  company,  a  small  teen-age  Negro  and  a  large \nwhite  man  swung  at  each  other.  A  large  colored man  went \nover  from  the Hilby.  It looked  as  if trouble  was  brewing, \nso  I  called  the  police.  A car came  within a  few  minutes. \nMeanwhile,  the  situation ironed  itself out. \nA  few  minutes  later,  three  white  men  standing  against \nthe  fence  next  door,  called a  police  car.  The  men  said \nthere  was  a  man  with  a  knife. \nThe  situation eased up.  The  box  office  continued  to \nsell  tickets,  but  that  did not  reduce  the  size  of  the  crowd \nvery much.  There  were  sheriff's cars  nearby.  I  did  not \nsee  Clark until  5:30  or  so. \nAt  5:30,  there  was  a  new  run on  the  office;  about \nseventeen to  twenty Negroes  bought  tickets  for  the  white \nsection.  I  was  calling the  police  from  the  cashier's box, \nwhen  two  persons  asked  for  their money  back.  Out  of  the \nwindow,  I  saw  a  Negro  man  with  a  bottle  in his hand  and \nhis  arm  drawn  back.  I  told  the  cashier  to  get  down.  I \nwas  calling the  police  because  it had looked like  to me \nthere  was  going  to be  a  big bra'{<ll.  This  was  about  fifteen \nminutes  after the  Negroes  had  come  to  the  Theater.  Then \nI  saw  Sheriff Clark.  He  had  been  there  before,  but  had \nleft. \nC-6 \n\nA crowd  of whites  rushed up  to  the  theater,  and \nsomeone  hollered that  there  were  niggers  in the  theater. \nI  asked  for  a  chance  to  work  it out.  .-\\I  told  the  situa \ntion to  the  Negroes  in the  theater,  they were  anxious  to \nleave.  Some  men  hollered,  11Get  out  of  here.  You  don't \nbelong.\"  I  saw  no  one  get  hit.  The  Negroes  went  out  the \nfront  while  I  went  out  the  back.  I  did not  see  the  posse \nabuse  Negroes.  Trouble  did not  broil  up  whenever  the \npossemen left.  There  was  no  trouble  after  the  Negroes \nleft  the  theater.  The  box  office  closed  down. \nI  called my  theater chain.  John Doar  told me  I \nshouldn't have  exaggerated when  I  called. \nI  get most  of my  movies  from Atlanta. \nI  do  not  know  how  many  times  I  phoned  the  police \non July 4.  I  did not  call  the  police before  6  p.m.  for \nany  incidents  at  the  ยทuilby Theater.  I  called once  about \nsome  hoods  at  the Halton Theater,  about  ten a.m.  Both \npolice  and  sheriff's cars  patrolled  regularly on July 4. \nWhen  the  theater opened,  a  sheriff's car was  at  the \ntheater,  but  it left.  There  \"t~lere  no  lmvmen  in the  area \nwhen  the  rough-looking  't-vhites  were  there.  No  lawmen \nattempted  to make  it possible  for  the  Negroes  to  enter \nthe  white  section of  the  theater. \nSeating  at  the Wilby Theater,  as  well  as  at  the vJalton, \nwas  segregated until  July 4,  1964.  Now  Negroes  sit wher \never  they please  in the  theater.  There  has  been only  one \nsmall  incident  since  then.  There  was  an unruly  crowd  in \nthe  second  balcony.  \"Jhites  were  interfering with  the \nNegroes.  I  called the  police  on  that  occasion. \nC-6-b \n\nJOliN  CLOUD \n(VJhite) \nI  work  for  the Alabama Department  of  Public Safety. \nI  am  the major  in  charge  of  the  patrol,  or enforcement \ndivision.  I  supervise  the  supervisors  for  eleven  districts. \n11y  immediate  supervisor  is  Colonel  Lingo.  I  place  troops \non  orders  from Colonel Lingo. \nDuring  the  last part of  June  or first part of July, \n1964,  I  sent extra troopers  to  Selma.  This  was  done  on \nthe basis  of  reports  from  the  district supervisors  and on \nthe  basis  of Col.  Lingo's  personal observation.  ltle  never \nsent more  than  twenty  troopers.  Some  troopers  were  placed \non  standby,  also.  Two  hundred  troopers  were  on  alert once. \n~eports from  state  investigators  indicated the  situation \nwas  tense. \nl  came  to  Selma  July 4  or s.  I  saw  a  goodly number \nof white  groups  gathered  around,  especially by  the  theaters. \nI  saw  some  cars  from  outside the  county.  There was  a  large \nnumber  of NSRP  and  sfmilar elements  from  Shelton  and Autauga \nCounties.  I  saw  several  tags  from  those  counties. \nI  observed  the  situation  in Birmingham  for  two  or three \nweeks  prior to  the  riots.  1\\le  conditions  in Selma were \nfollowing  a  pattern  similar to  that which  preceded  the \nBirmingham riot.  The  scale was  smaller,  but  the  pattern \nwas  similar.  I  did not  think that Sheriff Clark could handle \nthe  situation which  I  thought might  arise. \nI  have  had  a  large  amount  of experience with  \"first \ntimes\"  for  integration.  It is  a  good  idea to  take  special \nprecautions.  I  was  in Selma  only until dark on  July  5. \nCol.  Lingo  stayed.  The  Department of  Safety had men  on \nstandby  at a  hotel  after the  incident  at the A.H.E.  hall. \nThey  patrolled the  city.  There were  no  state patrol person \nnel at the Green  Street  Church  as  far  as  I  know.  State \ntroopers  patrolled the  city streets  in Selma on  the night \ns. \nof  July \nOur main  radio  station  is  on  the  highway.  The  Sheriff's \noffice has  a  base  station.

The  shop has  a  big window;  'it's like \nsitting outside.  July 4  was  a  holiday but  I  went  down  to \nthe  shop  anyway.  Around  11 o'clock I  got  a  paper  and \nbegan  to  read  it. \nAround  12:30  I  saw  a  lot of  colored people  gathering. \nThe  crowd  kept yelling and yelling.  It was  lined up  toward \nHashington Street.  About  fifteen  or twenty-five  Negroes \ngathered by t.Voolworth 's;  so  did a  few  whites.  There  tvas \nanother  crowd by  Kress's  and  some  other crowds. \nI  was  sitting  inside  the  shop  when  the  box office \nopened.  Hothing  different happened  from what  had happened \nover  the  past  forty years.  Negroes  went  into  the  second \nbalcony. \nI  saw  two  or three Negroes  going back and  forth between \nthe  groups  of Negroes.  There  were  no  whites  except  ticket \nbuyers  until later.  Then  four  or five  whites.  ยท \nAs  soon  as  the  upstairs  got full  the  Negro  adults \nbought  tickets  and went  in on  the  previously white  side \nabout  twenty  or twenty-five.  About  twenty-five  or thirty \nminutes  later a  group of  Negroes  carne  out.  I  saw  a  leader \nof  the  colored group  say  to  Sheriff Clark,  ~~~ove that crowd \nof ttthites.\"  I  didn't hear Clark's  reply.  Then,  the  Negro \nsaid,  \"Let's  go  get  'ern,  boys.\"  Then  officers  carne  \"from \nmost  everywhere.\"  They  started swinging  their clubs. \nI  did not  see  anyone  keep  Negroes  out of  the  theater. \n1  did not  see  any  rough  crowd  of whitesgo  into  the  theater. \nI  saw  police  cars  go  back and  forth.  A county  car parked \nright  in  front  of  the  barber  shop  tvhen  the  crowd  got big. \nA \"dozen  or two  dozen\"  officers were  there.

There were \nwhite  people  in  front of  the newsstand  also,  and  on  the \nsidewalk.  I  did not  notice  colored or white  people on \nthe  corners.  I  wen.t  outside  and  asl~ed the  group  to  leave \nmy  driveway.  I  closed the  gate  and  locked  it.  Some  of \nthe group went  toward  the  theater and  some  stood  in  front \nof my  house.  I  went  on  my  porch.  Hy  yard  is  fenced  in \nall around.  I  didn't notice  any  particular Negro  going \nback and  forth.  I  heard  some  obscene  language.  I  saw \nSheriff Clark. arrive  and  park across  the  street.  I  did  ยทยท \nnot  see  any  Negro  walk out  to  Sheriff Clark.  I  saw  Sheriff \nClark get out  of his  car.  He  walked  across  the  street and \ntried to  get  them  to  move  on,  both white  and  colored.  He \ndid  disperse  both white  and  Negroes.

I  saw \nvehic::les  from  county  numbers  14,  16,  48,  58,  and 1,  as \nwell  as  a  good  many  out-of~state cars.  County  #14  is \nChilton,  County  #1  is Jefferson,  County  #58  is Shelby, \nCounty  #2  is Nobile;  there were  some  Nobile  cars.  I  don't \nremember  when  I  first went  to  the  \\\\iilby  Theater,  but  I  went \nin response  to  a  call.  I  saw  several  \"rough-looking white \nmen  hanging  around,\"  several Negroes  also.  There were \nseveral whites  in front  of  Carter 1 s  and \\ยทJoolworth' s  and \nseveral on cars.  They  were  sitting on  the  :Benders  of  the \nparked cars.  There  were  several Negroes  by  the  Silver Noon \nCafen  I  dispersed  the  three rough-looking whites,  but \ndid not  disperse  the Negroes.  Then  I  left; before  I  left, \nI  sawยท  Negroes  to-into  the  theatre.  I  came  baclc.  about \nthir1:y  to  thirty-fi~e minutes  later. \nr~. Butler stopped me  and  told me  there was  an \nincident  across  the  street.  He  said he  thought  a  white \nperson had  tried to  jump  a  colored boy.  I  went  back  to \npatrolling.  I  heard on  the radio  that there  appeared  to \nbe  a  fight  in the  making.  I  went  as  fast  as  I  could.  I \nsaw  Sheriff  Clark  and  another man  walk  across  the  street. \nThere  was  a  gang  of whites  and  a  gang  of  colored.  They \nwere  jeering at each other and facing  each other.  Another \npoliceman  and  I  moved  the whites  first,  then we  went  baek \nand  \"assisted the  sheriff move  the  colored people.\"  In \nvestigator Head was  with  Clark. \nI  saw no  Negroes  abused.

The  officers were  Foster,  Jones,  Burroughs, \nSteinwinder,  Kilgore,  and  Brunson.  I  do  not  recall making \nany  arrests. \n.  That  night,  I  heard  a  call about  an  incident  at \nClay's  Casino.  Someone  had  thrown  an  object  through  the \nwinds:hield  of  the  Carson's  car.โข. .  tfuen  I  arrived,  the  Hegroes \nwere  doing nothing  but milling  around.  That  is  a  colored \narea,  but  there  is a  white  area  just north..  To  get home \nfrom downtown,  a  white would have  to  go  through  the  colored \nsection. \nOn  July  5,  I  was  patrolling near  the A.N.E.  Hall on \nLawrence,  Sylvan,  Jeff Davis,  and Green Streets.  I  was  in \nCar  11.  Officer  Ellison was  with me.  We  traveled north \nC-10 \n\non  Lawrence  Street.  As  we  passed  the  end  of  one  of  the -\napartment buildings,  there was  a  loud racket,  as  if some \nthing hit the  car or  as  if the  car had  snapped  a  stick.  He \nstopped  and  got  out  of  the  car.  Behind  the  car,  in its \ntrack,  was  a  small  coke  bottle.  I  picked  it up.  Then \nwe  went  up  the  street,  turned  around  and  drove  back,  going \nsouth on  Lawrence.  As  we  got  to the  same  place,  another \nCoca  Cola bottle hf!t  the  car.

Butler  said let them in.  He  sold them \nthe  tickets. \nThen  I  went  to  the  Silver Noon  Cafe  on  the  corner \nof  Selma  and  Franklin.

An \n\"agitator\"  in a  red  shirt,  a  \"nigger,\"  said,  ''Let's \nget  the  white  son-of-a-bitches.\"  I  saw  a  sheriff's car \nwith  the  sheriff and  four  deputies.  \"He  dispersed both \nthe  niggers  and  the  whites.''  I  saw  some  rocks,  three \nor four knives,  and  a  bicycle  chain  in the  hands  of the \n\"niggers.\"  I'd say,  in my  opinion,  in not  more  than  five \nminutes  there  might  have  been  a  riot. \nI  stayed  there  forty-five  minutes.  I  saw  no  policemen \nthere  at  all.  I'm sure  of  that.  I  saw  some  \"niggers\" \ncome  out  of  the  theater.  I  saw  no  arrests made.

He  turned away  and  said,  ''Let's  go  get  'em.\" \nI  helped  the  sheriff,  Goodwin,  and  others.  He  dispersed \nboth  the  whites  and  the  Negroes.  I  did  not  observe  any \ndistinction in treatment  of  the  whites  and  Negroes.  I \ndid not  see  any white  crowd.  I  did not  see  the  Negroes \ncome  out.  I  did not  see  Sheriff Clark  return. \nC-13 \n\nJ.Al-1ES  CHENS \n(Negro) \nI  have  a  B.s.  degree,  an H.S.,  and  am  a  doctor of \nliterature.  I '.ve  attended  school  at the University of \nNichigan,  the  University of  Chicago,  and  at Louisiana \nState University. \nI've been  President of  Selma University  for eight \nand  one  half years.  Benny  Tucker was  \"never expelled\" \nfrom Selma University.  Instead,  Tucker was  dropped  in \nJuly oยฃ.1963  for poor  scholastic standing. \nI  am  not  aware  of any  degree  in Theology  that Tucker \never obtained. \nSelma University has  approximately  220  students.  In \nthe  fall of 1963,  twenty-three of  them,  all Negroes,  were \narrested.  I  had no  personal knowledge  of why  the  students \nwere  arrested,  but  they  had  told me  it was  for  demonstrat \ning.  Because  of  a  rule  at Selma University  that  a  student \nwho  misses  more  than  twenty  percent of  the  sessions  in a \ncourse  is dropped  from  that  course,  parents  of the  arrested \nstudents  urged me  to  arrange  for  their return  to  school. \nThereupon,  I  contacted Judge  Hare.  I  do  not know  whether \nthe  cases  were  in  Judge ยทNallory's  court.  Judge  Hare  gave \nhis  full  cooperation.  I  asked  the  students whether  they \nwould  rather demonstrate  or go  to  school.  A.  c. 'Pilliams \nand  Emmett  Anderson  said  they  preferred  to  continue  their \ndemonstrations.  Judge  Hare  arranged  for the  release  of all \nthe  students but  those  two.  He  gave  the  students  an \n\"ordinary lecture\",  proscribing  \"all demonstrations\".  The \nstudents  had  been  in  jail about  a  week.  On  June  16,  1964, \nHare  contacted me  about  the  students.  I  recommended  the \ncharges  be  dropped  and  I  never heard  another word  about \nit. \nC-14 \n\nJAMES  FOSTER \n(White) \nI  am  a  traffic officer with the  Selma Police. \nOn  July 4,  I  was  on duty  from 8  a.m.  to  9  or 10  p.m.  My \nduty was  routine  patrol,  watching  four  groups  that might \ncause  trouble.  I  patrolled the  entire downtown  area.  I \nwas  on  a  motorcycle  that day,  with call numbers  77  and \n99.  I  noticed a  crowd  gathering  at the  Wilby  theatre \nand went  over  there.  I  was  not dispatched,  but  just saw \na  possible problem and went  over  to  the  theatre.  A car \nhad come.  Sgt.  Goodwin  and  Officer  Jones  were  there. \nSheriff  Clark had  come  at about  the  same  time.  He  had \njust got  out of his  car when  \"we\"  rode  up.  :I  saw no \npossemen  at the  theatre  until  the  trouble  arose.  After \nthe  police dispersed a  crowd  of  b~elve to  fifteen whites, \nwe  went  down  to help Sheriff  Clark disperse  the Negroes. \nI  recognized Alvery Williams,  whom  I  saw  talking  to \nSheriff  Clark.  I  recognized no  other Negroes  or whites, \nalthough  I  have Tived in Selma fifteen years.  There \nwere  several out-of-county license  plates  in town  that day. \nSmall groups  had gathered in different parts  of  town.  I \nstayed in the  area of  the  ~~lby Theatre for  about  twenty \nminutes  after the  e~owd had been dispersed.  I  did not see \nwhites gยทo  into the  theatre or  Negroes  come  out.  I  did not \nknow  there were  Negroes  in the  theatre,  although  I  had \nseen one  at  the box  office previously used  only by whites. \nI  knew  the civil rights  act had passed and  that it applied \nto  the  Wilby.  I  knew  the Wilby had been  segregated before. \nA patrol car received a_call concerning  a  bottle \nthrown  through~the windshield  and  resulting injuries.  I \nwent  to  the  area of  Clay's  Casino  and  the Roxy  Theatre; \nthat is predominatly Negro  section of  town.  The  police \ndispersed the  crowd  of  Negroes  and  a  crowd  of whites. \nAfter  they had cleared the  crowds,  the  police directed \ntraffic.  I  don't remember  whether  I  saw  any  possemen  at \nClay's  Casino.  Later,  the  police investigated the rock \nthrowing  incident. \nPatrolling on a  motorcycle,  I  was  in the vicinity \nof  the  o.w.c.  homes  the e~ening of  July  s.  My  call number \nwas  77  or 99.  MY  location was  approximately  a  block be\" \nhind  the A.M.E.  Hall.  A call came  over  the radio from \nthe desk,  stating that Sgt.  Goodwin's  car had been hit.  I \nwas  ordered out of  the  area,  because  I  lacked  protection \non my  motorcycle.  I  went  to  the corner  of  Selma  and Green, \nparked my  motorcycle,  and directed traffic.  Traffic was \nheavy  in the  area,  so  I  kept cars from going north  on \nGreen  Street.  I  was  not  in the  area of  the Hall  itself. \nC-15 \n\nI  was  in car 11  after 6  p.m.  on  July 6,  patrolling \nwith Lt. Knight.  We  went  to  the Mt.  Ararat Baptist Church, \nwhich  is on Mechanic  Street by Medley Avenue.  Our  pur \npose  was  \"to  patrol  the  area and keep  the  peace.\"  I  do \nnot know  who  the  speaker  is.  After  the meeting was  ad \njourned,  patrol cars were  standing by.  Most  of  the  crowd \nhad  left.  I  observed  that  two  rocks  were  thrown.  One \ncame  across  a  house  near  the  policemen.  Another was  down \nthe  road.  We  stayed in the  area until  the  crowds  had  left. \n\nARTHUR  ATCHISON \n(~-bite) \nI  work  at the Hendrick  Tractor  I  have \nCd~pany. \nbeen  a  member  of  the mounted  posse  for  four  br  fi~e years. \nSheriff  Clark  said the  purpose  of  the  mounted  posse  was \nto  assist the sheriff's department  in maintalnitig iaY1  and \norder,  to  protect whites  and  Negroes.  My  duties have  inw \neluded rescue work  and emergencies,  such  as  the  flood  of \n1961.  There  are  thirty-five members  in the mounted  posse. \nNcLeod  was  once  at  a  meeting.  He  did not  state,  \"We  must \nmeet  force with force.\"  No  members  of  the  posse  are \nNegroes.  I  went  to l:1ontgomery  once  on  standby. \nOn  July 4,  I  was  in a  county car.  There  could have \nbeen  three  or four  other  possemen  around.  I  was  in a  car \nwith Deputy Bates.  v.:e  got  a  radio call to come  to  the \nvJilby.  I  was  in Car  D4,  DS,  or  D6. \nI  arrived at the A.M.E.  Hall  at about  7  o'clock. \nI  arrived in a  county car with deputies  Hright  and Blair. \nThe  meeting had not started when  I  arrived.  Three hundred \nto  350  Negroes  were  on hand.  There were  about  a  hundred \ndeputies  present,  more  or less.  I  heard clapping  and \nsinging,  including  \"vJe  ,.,Jill  Overcome.\"  The  Negroes  stayed \nin about  two  hours.  They  started out,  someone  said  \"Every \nbody  back  in the  church.\"  There was  a  huge  crowd  outside \nin addition to  those  inside.  One  Negro  outside was  talking \nloud,  and  he  said he \"t-1as  in the Army  and  had  a  gun and  he \nwould  get it and be  equal  to  those  across  the  street.  He \ncame  out  about  a  half hour  later.  He  was  almost  across  the \nstreet.  They  were  clapping  and  singing  and hollering. \nThey  began  to  stand around,  talking.  I  saw  two  white men \ncome  out. \nRocks  were  thrown from across  the  street.  They  were \nthrown  at two  intervals.  I  heard  a  shot  about  the  time  of \nthe  first group  of rocks,  then a  barrage.  A white  man \nstepped  toward  the  Jeff  Davis  side  of  the  church.  He  got \norders  to  step in and  break it up,  after  the  second barrage \nof roclts.  The  Negroes  ran all over,  I  lost  track of  the \nwhite  men. \nvยท7e  came  across  them again.  One  was  lying  on  the \nground,  and  the  other was  sitting around.  Only  the  deputies \nwere  near  them when  I  arrived. \nI  did not  strike or kick  the  photographers  and  I  did \nnot see  any  other sheriffโขs  people  do  so.  They walked  off, \nand  I  did not  see  them again.  There was  blood on  them.  I \nsaid nothing  to  them.  No  one  offered them medical  assistance. \nI  did not  stril<:e  or abuse  any  Negroes.  I  did not \nsee  others  do  so.  F/e  patrolled the  area.  lJe  did not  go \nto  any  Negro  houses.  I  cruised the area in a  county  car. \nC-16 \n\nOn  July  6,  1  parked  on  the  Hedley  Street in front \nof  the church door,  with Deputies  v~ight and  Blair. \nThere were  a  couple  of bricks  thrown  that night.  One  hit \nthe  bumper  and  one  hit the  fender  of  the  county  car near \nwhich  1  was  standing by.  1  have  attended  other meetings \nand  these  procedures  are  not  unusual.  I  have  run whites \noff from  the  Tabernacle  and from  the  church  on  Jeff  Davis \nwhile meetings  were  in session. \nC-16-b \n\nJOHN  WARREN \n(vJh.ite) \nI  operate  the Thirsty Boy  drive-in restaurant. \nIt's in Selma,  behind Sears,  south  of  the  bank.  On  July \n4,  at about  3:00p.m.,  four  Negroes  drove  onto  the  parking \nlot of  the Thirsty Boy.  I  asked  them  to  leave because \nthey were  trespassing.  They  left,  and  I  called the  sheriff \nand  asked him to come.  While  previously  I  had  always -\ncalled the  police when  trouble  arose,  Mr.  Pitts had in\" \nstructed me  that if any  trouble  arose  on  July 4,  I  should \ncall the sheriff. \nThe  Negroes  parked  across  the  street and  immediately \ncame  inside  the  Thirsty Boy.  I  asked  them to  leave,  in a \nlow  tone  of voice  and mostly by motion.  There  were  several \npeople  in the  restaurant. \nAt  that time  there were  disturbances  in downtown \nSelma.  I  recognized  the  whites,  but  I  couldn't identify \nthem now. \nThe  sheriff came  in and deputy Hewston handed me  the \nwarrants.  I  signed  the  warrants,  and  the  sheriff removed \nthe  Negroes.  I  did not  see  the  sheriff abuse  them.  The \nsheriff was  there when  Hewston handed me  the warrants.  I \ndidn't know  the  names  of  the  Negroes. \nI  believe  that if the  sheriff had not removed  the \nNegroes  there would  have  been trouble.  That's  why  I  called \nthe  sheriff. \nc-.17 \n\nDR.  RUSSELL \n(V.lhite) \nI've been  in Selma  two  and  a  half years.  I  attend \ned  the  University of Alabama School  of  Dentistry. \nI  treated Roberta Corson.  The  pictures  [Def.  Ex. \nNos.  8  and  9]  look  to me  as  if they were  taken a  few  days \nafter the  accident.  I  was  called by  Dr.  George  Nicholson. \nI  examined Roberta Corson at  the  hospital.  The  injuries \nwere  more  serious  than the  pictures  show. \nC-18 \n\nJ. E.  HEv1STON \n(vJhite) \nI  am  a  Dallas  County  deputy  sheriff.  I've been \nwith  the  Department  five  years  last February. \nOn  July 4,  1964  I  came  on  duty  as  a  patrol deputy \nat  8:00  a.m.  I  received  a  radio  call to  go  to  the \nThirsty Boy.  Sheriff  Clark and  Deputy  Bates  were with \nme  there.  He  went  inside.  I  had warrants which  I  l-ras \ngiven  to  carry with me.  This  is  common  practice.  Some \nof  the  warrants  are  partially filled  in earlier in  the \nday.  The  notary  signature  is not stamped  in  ahead of \ntime.  The  warrant  for  trespass  [in  Pl.  Ex.  No.  4]  is \nfilled out  in my  handwriting.  I  don't know  when  the \ncharge  was  typed  in. \nHhen  I  went  into  the Thirsty Boy  I  talked with \n'Harren,  who  said that  there were  people  there he  would \nlike to  remove.  I  told him he would have  to  sign  the \nwarrants.  I  gave  them  to  him  and he  signed  them.  I  did \nnot know  the  names  of  the  Negroes  at the  time. \nThey  were  sitting in  the middle  of the  restaurant. \nThere were  four  of  them.  I  helped  to  arrest  them.  I  did \nnot  use  a  cattle prod  and  did not notice  any.  I  don't \nrecall  their objecting  to  being  arrested.  They were  put \nin my  car.  I  didn 't see  them  abused.  I  didn 't see a  Negro \ntna-le- kick Clark.  He  took them  to  the  county  jail. \nDeputy Bates,  two  special deputies,  and  I  arrived  at \nGreen  Street about  7:30.  Negroes  had  just begun  to  arrive. \nDuring  the meeting  there were  about  seventy-five Negroes \noutside  the  hall and  about  200  inside.  I  was  stationed in \nfront  of  the  church on  the  same  side  of  the  street, \n~-rentyยญ\nfive  or thirty feet  from  the  door.  Hhen  the  Negroes  came \nout,  they  separated,  some  going  north  and  some  going  south. \nI  saw  a  group of Negroes  behind  a  hedge.  Rocks  were  thrown, \nbut  I  could not  apprehend  anyone.  I  saw  two  white men  come \nout of  church before  the  rest of  the  people  and  set up \ncameras  to  take  pictures of  the  crowd  coming  out.  After \nthe  confusion  started I  didn't see  them  any more. \nI  did not hit any  Negro  or fire  any weapon,  nor  did \nI  see  any  officer abuse  a  Negro. \nC-19 \n\nGED'RGE  B.

I  am \nan N.D. \nI  treated Roberta  Corson  on  July 4,  1964,  according \nto  my  records,  at about  10:00  p.m.  She  had  lacerations \nabout her lip with a  piece of glass.  I  removed  the \nglass  and  cal1ed Dr.  Donald Russell  to  treat the  damage \nto  her  teeth.  Her  lips were more  swollen  than  the  pictures \n[Def.  E,c.  Nos.  9A  and  9B)  show.  She  had no  other injuries \nthat I  know  of. \nThat  same  night  I  saw George Hichael  Corson.  Accord \ning  to  the  records,  he  had  lacerations  of  the  n.eck and \nright  arm.  No  glass.  He's  in the  pictures  [Def.  Ex. \nNos.  9C  and  9D];  90  shows  a  neck suture. \nThe  same  night,  James  Virgil  Jones  had  lacerations  of \nboth arms.  They were  superficial.

I \ngot  to  the  curb  and three white men  grabbed me  and \nheld me.  I  was  hurt in the  neck  and  the  arm. \nThere  were more  th~n 40  in the  group  of Negroes \nby  the  Casino. \nC-23 \n\nROBERTA  00 RSON \n(White) \n.Qn  .}'uly  Mother saw  a  bunch C?f  colored \n4,.~ 196~, \npeople  beside  Clay's Casino.

I  was  detailed over \nhere  on  the  ''trouble  they were  having\"  at that time. \nI  riding with Capt. Hoore  all day.  There was  an \n~1as \nincident  shortly after noon on July 4th.  A man,  driving \na  car with Mississippi  license plates,  had  just been in \nthe Selma  Del  and  said a  waitress  had  asked him  to report \nthat a  blond-headed man  with a  camera was  in there with \na  pistol.  I  reported to  the sheriff's office by  radio, \nand  they  immediately dispatched someone.  The  radio  log \nshows  that on July  5,  atยท 7:52  p.m.,  345  (me)  radioed  the \nstation to phone  the city police about  a  cottonhead photo \ngrapher with a  gun. \nI  stayed in Selma  several days.  I  did not  stay in \nSelma  the night of  the  5th.  I  heard about  it on  the \nsheriff's network. \nc-2s \n\nQHARLIE  A1'1HONS \n(White) \nNy  wife  and  I  were  driving down  Lapsley Street \nwhen  our  auto was  struck by  an  object.

It broke  the back glass \nand  hit the  trunl(.  There were  just a  few  scratches. \nWe  didn't see who  threw  the object,  but we  did see \nNegroes  in the  cafe.  I  went  into  Police Headquarters \nand  reported  the  incident. \nC-27 \n\nJOHN  A.  BEVERLY \n(Hhite) \nI  have  lived for  thirty-five years  in Dallas County.  I \nhave  been a  posse member  since Clark came  into  office.  I \nam  a  special deputy  (part-time deputy).  I  have  attended a \nNational  State's Rights  Part meeting.  Six men  in \nClark~s \ngroup were  outside.  Fifteen or  twenty  attended.  I  didn't \nhear what  was  said. \nI  don't l'now  how  many  special deputies  or  possemen \nthere are.  I  went  to Tuscaloosa with  the sheriff.  That \nwas  on  the  date  that  the  University of Alabama was  integrated. \nI  did not  go  to Notasulga.  I  went  to Birmingham when  there \nwas  racial difficulty.  I  never left the  county  for  the  sheriff \nexcept  on racial  cases.  All of Sheriff Clark's  people  are \nwhite. \nI  went  to  the M1E  Hall July 5.  I  have  observed other \nNegro  meetings.  The  sheriff did not  treat  the Negro  meetings \ndifferent  than the NSRP  meeting.  I  arrived about  7:30 in a \ncar,  D-5,  with Deputy  Leo  Nichols.  ''Niggers\" were milling \naround  outside  in a  group  of about  fifteen to  twenty.  I \nstayed until  the  meeting broke up  at  about  9:30 โข . ยท \"l!e  Shall \nOvercome\" was  sung.  They were  singing,  slapping  their hands, \njumping  up  and  dot~, and marching  around.  No  one  Negro  caught \nmy  eye.  I  heard one  Negro  say he  could get his  gun and  could \nhandle  all of us  sons  of  a  bitches.  I  sau two  white men  coming \nout  of  the ยทchurch;  the  light went  off.  I  heard them say  \"Let's \nget  โขem.\"  r.ocks  or  stones  a  whole  barrage  of them,  were  throtm. \nI  heard one  shot.  Crocleer  gave  the orders  to move  in and  \"bust \nthem up.\"  I  next  saw  the  two  white men  laying  on  the ground. \nNegroes  were  between the  sheriff's men  and  the  posse.  The \ncrowd was  dispersed.  I  did not  see anyone  strike the reporters. \nI  did not  see  the  posse  abuse  or kick  the  reporters.  I  did not \nsee  the Negroes  abused.  Crocl,er  said to  find  out  if they need \nmedical  aid.  I  saw McLeod,  but did not  see him hit anyone, \nand  did not hear him give  anyone  any  instructions.  Clark came \nup  after all this  occured.  Clark ordered the officers  to  ask \npeople  to  go  into houses  and stay there  for  their own \nprotect~ \nion.  I  did not  see  lights  on Negro  houses  knocked out.  I  did \nnot  see deputies  break any  cameras. \nThere was  another meeting on July 6.  Abernathy spoke. \nI  went with Deputy Hright  and Blair.  The  meeting was  in East \nSelma on Hechanic Street.  The  car in which  I  was  riding was \nhit by a  rock.  Actually it was  a  bricle.  This was  the  only \nincident of rock throwing  that I  know  of. \nGildersleeve  told Sheriff Clarke  that he was  proud  that \nthe  sheriff was  there  to keep  law  and  order that  night. \nI  have  no  idea how  many  officers were  present. \nC-28 \n\nGEORGE  KING \n(l-Jhite) \nI  went  to  the Post  Office and  eturning home. \n~1as l .. \nAs  I  approached  near  the  intersection of Lapsley and  Small \nand  someone  shouted,  \"Hey,  white  folks,  stop .. \"  I  first \nstarted  to  stop  and  then decided against  it and  as  I  sped \naway  someone  shouted an obscene remark at me.  I  then reยท \nturned dot-mtown  and  reported  the incident to  police,  furnishing \nthe  identity of  the Negro  I  thought  made  the remarl(.s.  He \nwas  wearing a  red pullover  sports  shirt.  Later  I  identi-\nfied  the Negro,  and he was  convicted  in-Recorders  Court  and \nfined  t-wenty-five dollars. \nC-29 \n\n. \n.. \nFRANK  BARR \n(White) \nOn  July  6,  1964,  I  went  to  Lapsley Street with the \ndescription of  a  Negro  male who  was  wanted  for  throwing a  rock \nat Mr.  King.  King  identified the Negro,  who  had  a  golf \nball and  a  rock in his  pocket.  I  recollect  that  the young man ยท.โข  \" \nwas  cursing and hurling rocks.  I  do  not  know  if the Negro \nwas  tried.  I  had  a  warrant  somewhere.  It is a  custom of  the \nPolice Department  that when  an officer has  a  description he \ntakes  a  person  into custody  and  gets  a  warrant  later. \n\nZEKE  STEINVnNDER \n(ltlhite) \nI  investigated an incident  near  the Savoy Cafe with \nanother  Selma  police officer,  Frank  Barr.

The  water \nposse was  called out on July  6  to  investigate a  body .in the \nSoapstone Creek.  They  recovered a  Negro  who  was  from \nPensacola,  Florida.  The  posse has  two  underwater men.  They \nwere  called to  pull a  truck out of  the Alabama  river.  That's \nthe by-laws  of  the  Dallas  County  Sheriff's posse  [Def. \nEx.  No.  7].

He  said he could whip  them all and  that he was \ngoing home  to  get his pistol.  \"He  ignored him.\"  I  heard \nsomeone  inside say that now  The  Civil Rights Act  has  passed \nwe  don't have  to rape white women,  \"and  I'm going out  and \nget me  a  white woman  and have rae  a  white child.\"  I'm posi \ntive I  heard that;  I  was  standing by a  tree at the front  of \nthe hall. \nI  saw  two  photographers,  one with a  camera  and one with \nlights.  The  lights were  set up  to shine at the church. \nThey were  on. \nC-33 \n\nThe  meeting disbanded!  and  some  went  off.  Some  ~1ent \nback into  the hall.  The  l1ght went  out and  I  heard  a  gun \n1 \ngo  off.  Then  there was  a  barrage of  br1cks  hitting metal. \nThen  I  think the  tear gas  was  used.  Crocker  gave  orders  to \nbreak it up.  It wasn't much  trouble since all of  them  ran. \nAt  the front  of  the hall,  by  a  bush or hedge  [shown  in \nDef.  Ex.  No.  SC],  I  stumbled on  a  't>Thite  man.  I  wยทas  corning \nfrom  the  rear of  the hallo  I  saw  one  sitting and  one  lying \non  the  ground.  Head  came  up  and  identified himself.  He \nasked  the white  on  the  ground what  happened,  but  I  didn't \nhear  the  reply.  Someone  said,  we'd better get  them  to  a \ndoctor.  I  left after that.  I'd had  orders  to clear the \nstreet and did.  I  saw  posseman beat  or abuse  a  Negro. \nC-33-b \n\nJOHN  GRIMES \n(v1hite) \n1  was  not  at  the  A.H.E.  Hall on  the  5th.

Stoves  and \nHead  went  into  the meeting.  After  the  meeting broke  up, \nbricks were  thrown  at the  car,  and  they did not move. \nI  did not hear  a  shot.  I  was  told  to  move  when  a  number \nof bricks were  thrown  again.  I  two  white men  come \nsa~1 \nout;  they  had  a  camera with  them.  The  whites were  among \nthe  Negroes  in front of  the  Church.  I  moved  into  the \narea to  disperse  the  crowd.  I  went  to  the  right of  the \nChurch  and  on  returning saw  the  two  photographers  on  the \nground.  I  saw  the Deputies  pick them up,  not  abuse  them. \nI  did not hit a  Negro  or see others  strike them.  I  had \nto  back up when  gas  was  used,  and  could not get close \nenough  to  strike them.  I  saw  Sheriff Clark there,  but  I \ndid not see  Clark  talking to  the newsmen.  I  saw McLeod \nthere,  but  did not  see HcLeod  talking  to  the newsmen. \nAfter the  crowd  dispersed,  I  was  instructed by  Clark \nand  Crocker  to  disperse  the  crowd  and see  that everyone \nwent home. \nI'm a  member,  but not  an  officer of  the White \nCitizens  Council.

I  saw  Rufus  Head \nand Deputy  Stoves  inside.  I  stood  in the  street right \nin  front  of the  church by  the  big oak  tree with Hewston \nand  Bates.  I  think there  is  a  curb  there.  About  200-250 \npeople were  inside.  They  came  out  about  9:30 or 10:00 \nand  then  some  went  back  in  the  church.  They  sang  a  song \nand  then  came  out with  two  white men,  one  of whom  had  a \ncamera.  The  Negroes  went  to  the  left,  toward  Selma \nAvenue  (south).  Then  a  dozen  or more  rocks  were  thrown \nand  Crocker ordered the  posse  to  disperse  the  Negroes. \nI  did not hit any  Negroes  or see  any  officer strike a \nNegro.  I  saw  the  two  white men  later on the  Jeff Davis \nside of  the  church.  One  was  on  the  corner and one  was \nsitting up.  I  did not  talk to  them.  There  were some \nmen  I  don't know  if they were  in  the  posse. \nther~but \nThen  the  two  white men  went  to  a  car. \nC-39 \n\nWILH&Mi SU'tl-1ER \n(T.-Jhite) \n11m  a  lifetime  resident of Dallas County.

Hy  instructions  didn't  include  an  order on where \nto  go.  I  went  to  the  Theater and  dispersed  a \n~Talton \ncrowd  there. \nI  was  directly across  the  street from  the  church on \nJuly  So  Around  250  to  300  Negroes  were  there.

Vehicle  lights were \nturned on  in order  to  see.  I  saw  the  two  men  in front  of \na  Negro  house  on  the  north  side of  the  church on  the ground. \nI  did not  say or hear  anyone  say anything  to  the men.  I \ndid not  hear or see  any  shooting.

I  have \n~ned \ntold whites  to  stay away.  I  do  not know  who  they were, \nprobably sightseers. \nI  was  at the  Hechanic  a-..urch meeting.  After the meet \ning was  over  I  was  standing beside  the church  and  an  object \ncame  directly behind me  and when  I  turned around  there \nwere  two  Negroes  running  down  the  street.

I  asked  them  what  had happened but they \ndidn't  answer.  I  went  to  turn my  car around  to  get some \nlights  on  them but,  they were  already  sitting up when  I \ngot back.

I  was \ndriving with Crocker in a  sheriff's caro  We  parked  on \nthe west  side  of  the  church across  the  street.  The  bus \narrived after we  did,  and  it parked  on  the  south side of \nthe  church.  I  got  out  of  the  car,  and  stood  right out \nside of  the  car.  I  saw  some  Negroes  at the  churcha  They \nwere  going  in and  some  were  standing outside.  The meeting \nhad  commenced  when  I  there.

When  the  crowd  had  started coming  out,  they \nturned  towards  their left (the  south side).  Then  one \nobject was  thrown and  hit the  buso  Then  another hit a \nwhite  corvairo  One  hit the right rear door  of the county \ncaro  One  hit right where  Crocker had  been.  Crocker had \nhanded me  the  tear gas  bomb  when  it appeared  there might \nbe  trouble.  He  told me  when  I  throw mine,  you  throw yours. \nAfter a  barrage  of rocks  was  thrown,  Crocker threw his \ntear gas  toward where  the rocks  came  from.  Then I  threw \nmy  tear gas.  The  Negroes  Later I  saw  two  men \ndisp.ers'e~ \ngoing  to  the  car.  I  did not hear  Blanchard McLeod  talk \nto  them.  I  did not hear anytldng.

A \ngroup went  into the  alley,  and  I  could not  say how  many \nwere  in the  alley;  it was  darko  The  tear gas  was  given \nout before  the people  came  out of the church.  I  could not \nhear what was  said insideo  The  necessity for  tear gas \nwas  anticipated on  the  basis  of what was  going  on inside \nthe  church.  There was  hollering inside.  The  basis  for \nusing  the  tear gas was  rock  throwing. \nI  do  not know  Charles  Robertson.  I  arrested \nRobertson,  but do  not  remember  the date.  It was  at the \ncourthouse.  I  wanted  to go  into the alley to check the \nregular line.  Robertson  spit on  the  floor  towards  me,  but \nnot  on me.

We  looked  around  in the vicinity of the  houses  with \nour  flashlights.  We  got back  into  the  car,  and  went  on \ndown  for  about  a  half block,  then  turned  around  and  came \nback  to  the  same  place.  Our  car was  struck again.  I  jump \ned out  of the  car  and  saw  a  boy run behind  the house.  There \nwere  two  of  them.  I  ran around  the  corner  of  the house, \nbut  the  boy  had  disappeared.  Goodwin  and  I  went  in different \ndirections.  I  turned  to  the  right  and went  in between  two \nhouses.  The  two  Negroes  were  not  apprehended.  I  heard  a \nnoise which  sounded  like  a  pistol shot.  Later Sgt.  Goodwยทin \nsaid he  had  fired  the  shot.  Sgt.

I've \nworked  in Dallas  County  since 1950,  in the Fourth Circuit \nsince  1941.  I've been  the  probation officer for  Dallas \nCounty  since  1950.  I  work  closely with  Judge  Hare, \nSheriff  Clark,  and  Solicitor HcLeod. \nI  gathered  figures  at lienry  Pitt's request  covering \nOctober  1954  to  October  196!~ from  the  probation record of \nDallas  County  Court.  The  figures  shot,T the  number  of  persons \nby  race  put  on  probation  for various  offenses.  The  figures \nare contained  in Defendant's  Exhibit  23. \nDefendant's  EXhibit  2L~  lists  the current  Dallas  County \nprobation figures  (a~cluding those  sentenced  in other  cir \ncuits).  The  exhibit  shows  the numbel..   of persons,  by  race, \non  probation for  various  offenses. \nDefendant's  Exhibit  25  consists  of  the  files  of \nsixty-eight demonstrators  arrested last fall.  The  infor \nmation was  on  the  fingerprint,  not  from  the  records  of \nthe  Juvenile Court.  I  don't remember  when  the  children ยท \n-.;.;ere  arrested;  I  don't  kno~1 the disposition,  I  don't know \nthe  names.  It was  a  random  sample. \nI  have only  heard one  criticism of  Judge  Hare,  namely \nthat  Negroes  feel  he  is entirely too  lenient ~1hen it comes \nto  sentencing for  serious  offenses  among  Negroes.  I  have \nnever  observed  prejudice. \n\nGEORGE  BAKER \n(vJhite) \n[I'm an F.B.I.  agent;  see  p.  B-27]  I  was  in Selma \nJuly 6  to 10  in my  official capacity.  I  investigated the \nregistration line procedure.  On  July 6  I  met  with Crocker \nand  Stoves,  who  explained the  system to me.  People  could \ncome  and  get  numbers.  After they  received  a  number,  they \ncould  leave  as  long  as  they were  there when  the  number  was \ncalled.  They  could  not  transfer their number,  but  could \nturn their  number  in. \nThere wa.s no formal  line outside  the  building.  People \nwere  in line inside the  building and  in informal  groups \ngathered  in the  shade  outside the  building.  I  did not  see \nthe  sheriff abuse  anyone.  The  lines were  orderly.  Both \nNegroes  and  whites  were  in the line;  there were  bunches  of \nwhites  and  bunches  of Negroes. \nOn  July  6  forty-nine  people(forty-eight Negroes,  one \nwhite)  obtained numbers.  Twenty-one Negroes  came  in.  On \nJuly  7,  three whites  and eighteen Negroes  received  numbers; \nthree whites  and  seventeen Negrยทoes  applied.  On  July  8, \nthree whites  and  ceventeen Negroes  received  numbers;  two \nwhites  and  thirteen Negroes  applied.  On  July  9,  three whites \nand  twenty-two  Negroes  received numbers;  one  white  and  fif \nteen Negroes  appliede  On  July 10,  seven whites  and  fifteen \nNegroes  received  numbers;  one  left before  the  day was  over. \nThere  were  possemen  inside  and  possemen  blocking  other \nentrances.  There were  possemen  in the  courthouse  and  in the \nalleys.  They  kept  the alley free  of disinterested  parties; \nF.B.I.,  the  sheriff,  and  newsmen  were  allowed  in the alley. \nC-47 \n\nJOSEPH  M.  CONNLEY \n(VJhite) \n[I'm a  special agent  for  the F.B.I.;  seep.  B-28];  I \nwas  in Selma from  July 6  to July 23,  1964. \nThe  registration lines varied from  four  or  five  to \nfifteen  or  twenty  persons  in length.  The  line was  located \non  the west  side  of  a  paved alley.  The  entrance which  is \nused  for  people who  park in the alley was  used  for  the voter \nregistration line.  Sixty numbers  were  given out.  I  was \ntold by  Crocker  sixty was  the maximum  number  the board  could \nhandle.  I  never  saw more  than  sixty persons  try to  register. \nI  never  saw  the sheriff arrest  or beat  anyone  in the  registra. \ntion lines.  Whites  and Negroes  got  numbers  in the  same  way. \nThe  registration office is on  the  ground  floor  about \nhalf-way down  the west  side of  the hall.  The  east  side  of \nthe  hall has  windows  for  the tax collector,  the probate \nclerk,  etc.,  for  people  to transact  business.  The  west \nยทside has  no  windows,  only  offices. \nOn  July 10  thirty numbers  were  issued  (twenty-two \nwhites,  ei~ht Ne~roes); twenty-one  applications were  processed \n(twelve whJ.tes,  eight Negroes).  A total of six Negroes  were \nstill waiting โข . (Four  inside,  two  outside).  I  was  told by \nCrocker  that  sixty was  the maximum  number  the  board  could \nhandle. \nThe  total number  showing  up  that week  never exceeded \n49. \nC-48 \n\n!\"&\\NK LafORTE \n(~.fuite) \nI'm a  police  captain.  I'm  the  identification \nofficer,  in  charge  of  records  and  personnel.  I've been \nwith  the  department  nineteen  years,  eleven  in  the  same \nposition. \nThere  are  set standard fines  for  certain offenses, \nwhich  the  recorder has  authorized  the  desk  to  accept. \nRoutine  cases  are  handled  at the  desk.  Charges  and  fines \nare  the  same  for Negroes  and whites.  In  the  nineteen \nyears  that  I  have  been  with  the  police  department,  I  have \nseen  no  discrimination between  Negroes  and whites  by  the \npolice  department.  The  fine  is nineteen  dollars  for  a \ndrunk white  and  nineteen  dollars  for  a  drunk Negro. \nUnder  my  supervision,  a  chart was  prepared  [Def.  Ex. \nNo.  26]  from  the  city warrants  in  Plaintiff's Exhibit  27A. \nThe  name,  warrant  number,  charge,  race,  and  disposition \nare  shown  on  the  chart.  '!he  warrant  number  is shown  on \nthe  arrest reports.  An  entry on  the warrants  shows  the \ndisposition,  and  is  the  same  as  the  docket  entry. \nThe  thirteen  or  fourteen demonstrators  weren.' t  pro \ncessed  in  the  City  Court.  Bond  was  never refused  to  them. \nBond  was  set for  them.  The  city has  never denied bail, \nexcept  on  capital offenses  (where  the  judge  has  to  set \nbail).  On  investigative  arrests we  cooperate  with  attor \nneys.  The  man  in charge  of  the  shift has  the  power  to  set \nbail:  $100.00  for D.C.;  $200.00  for  D. . t.J.I.  or A.&  B.; \n$300.00  for  aggravated A.&B. \nThe  city desk  is open  ~~enty-four hours  a  day  with \na  radio  dispatcher,  parking  ticket  clerk,  and  a  lieu \ntenant,  sergeant,  or captain  in  charge  of  the  shift.  The \nlieutenant,  sergeant,  or captain sets bail.  All  felony \ncharges  must  go  before  the  recorder  for  preliminary hear \ning,  or preliminary  hearing must  be waived. \nThe  City .Jail  and  our office  are  on  the  second  floor \nof  the  City Building.  The  County  Jail is on  the  third \nfloor.  The  two  jails are  administered  separately  and \nbooking  is generally  separate.  When  a  person  is brought \nin  for booking,  the  desk man  takes  the  information  that \ngoes  on  the  arrest report  form.  These  serve  also  as  a \njail register.  A warrant  is made  \"after the  prisoner is \nbooked.\"  Prisoners  can  ask for  a  hearing,  make  bond,  or \nget  a  continuance.  Otherwise  the  case  is tried in recorder's \ncourt  on  the Tuesday  after the  arrest.  Every  Tuesday, \nthe bailiff picks  up  all arrest  reports  and  takes  them  to \nthe  court  at 9:00  a.m.  and  2:30  p.m. \nC-49-ยทยท \n\nvJhen  the  demonstrators were  arrested,  the Sheriff \nasked me  to  supervise  the  booking  of the  prisoners  in \nthe County  Jail.  I  took our  jailer, and  we  went  upstairs. \nt,Je  helped make  up  booking  and  fingerprint  sheets.  I \nworked  almost  solely on  fingerprinting.  Affidavits  and \nwarrants were  not made  up  at that  time.  The  jail regis \nter is made  up  at the  close  of  the  day.  The  charge, \ninterfering with court,  was  made  at the  time  of booking. \n\"1  feel sure  of  that.\"  Five  or six were  charged with \nCCW.  The  affidavits  and warrants  were  made  out by  the \nsheriff's clerk;  Crocker  signed  them,  and  Pryon's  name \n.was  stamped.  The  prisoners  were  considered city \nprisoners  because  of  the city warrants. \nOn  Tuesday,  the  bailiff picked up  the warrants  and \nput  them  on  the  desk  for  the  recorder.  The  recorder did \nnot  pick up  the  warrants.  The  recorder  continued cases; \nwe  never enter the  continuance on  the  l>Tarrant  when  there \nis  a  group  of  that many  involved.  The  charge  was  put on \nthe  city booking  sheet  (arrest report),  but  the  details \nwere  not,  because  they  could be  gotten  from  the  county \nbooking  sheet. \nI  did  not  see  the  booking  sheets  for  the  demonstrators \nexcept briefly in  the  fingerprint  room.  I  did not  take \nthe  information  for  the  booking  sheets.  Mosley  is  the \ncounty  jailer. \nThe  city  jail floor space  is much  smaller than  the \ncounty  jail โข . Last  fall,  our  jail overflowed.  This  time, \nwe  avoided  the  problem by  taking  the  prisoners  to  the \ncounty  jail. \nEach  shift officer or sergeant  has  a  name  stamp.  If \nthe  officer is  present on  shift,  his  stamp  is used on  the \nshift for warrants.  This  has  been  the  custom  for several \nyears. \nJudge  Russell  is  the  recorder.  The  prosecutor in \nthe  recorder's  court  is Archie  Reeves.  Blanchard HcLeod \nis not  connected with  the  city court.  The  court has  two \nsessions:  9:00  and  2:30.  If a  person were  arrested \nTuesday  afternoon  at 6:00,  he  could  possibly spend  a  week \nin  jail, but he  could  ask  for  a  hearing. \nC-49-b \n\nEUGENIA  GUSOORF \n(Hhite) \nI've worked  in  the  probate  office \n~.renty-four \nyears  this  January.  I've served other judges  before \nJudge  Reynolds. \nI  prepared or had  prepared Defendant's  exhibit \nnumber  27o  Most  of  the  information  on  that exhibit \nwas  taken โข'\"fยฅ6t(r:.the  juvenile  records  for  1964.  The  time \nin  jail, was  not  filled out  from  documents  in  my \npossession.  The  compilation  carries  all cases  handled \nin  1964  to  the  time  of  the  trial. \nJudge  Reynolds  handles  \"each  individual case\" \nindividually.  During  September  and October 1963,  a \ncase worker  from  the  Department  of  Pensions  and Security \nhandled each case.  Cases  are  handled now  the  same  as \nthey were  in  I  have  witnessed no  discrimination \n1941~ \nin  Judge  Reynolds'  office. \nIf there  is  a  charge  of  a  state offen.se,  there  is \na  hearing.  v7itnesses  are  called.  The  judge  hears  every \ncase.  He  never makes  a  decision without  a  hearing. \nc-so \n\nMARTHA  YA\\\\IN \n(White) \nI  am  a  deputy  sheriff;  I  do  general  office  work. \nI'm in charge  of the  radio  and  the  log  sheets.  I've \nworked  six and  a  half  years  there.  I  compiled  a  chart \nfrom  the  register of  prisoners  in the  county  jail. \n[Def.  Ex.  Noo  28]. \nC-51 \n\nCLARENCE  MeGAN \n(White) \nI'm the  deputy  clerk of  the  Dallas  County Court. \nMrs.  Hewston  is  the  clerk of  the  Circuit  Court  and  ex ... \nofficio clerk of  the  county court.  I  handle  the  criminal \nside.  Hugh  Mallory  is  the  criminal  division  judge. \nHenry Reese  is  the  solicitor. \nAll  criminal  matters  in the  county,  except  for  city \ncases,  come  before  the  county court.  There  is no  justice \nof  the  peace  for  criminal  matters. \nI  prepared  defendant's  exhibit  number  29.  ~.Je  used \nfigures  from  January,  March,  May,  July,  September,  and \nNovember  of 1964. \nI  attend  ''every\"  court  session of  the  Dallas  County \nCriminal  Court.  I  collect  fines  and  costs  and  issue \nreceipts.  \"I  have  not11  observed  any  discrimination. \nMr.  McLeod  appears  in the  court  \"practically every \nsession'';  Mr.  Reese  has  been  in poor health.  McLeod  has \nnot  dealt  differently with  Negroes  \"to my  knowledge.\" \nFines  have  been  equal  for Negroes  as  far  as  I  know. \nThe  cases  of  Floyd  t~7ilson,  James  Bennett,  Billy Bennett, \nFranklin Bennett,  James  Jones,  Richard  Tucker were  continued. \nThe  United  States  District  Court  did not  take  jurisdiction \nso  far as  I  know. \nC-52 \n\nLEE  CALAME \n(v1hite) \nI've been a  partner in the  public  accounting  firm, \nStack and Calame,  since  1958.  I  was  a  field agent  for \nthe  I.R.S.  for  seven  and  a  half years  before  that.  I \nwas  an  accountant  with Pure  Oil  in Birmingham before \nthat.  I  went  to  night  school  in Birmingham.  I've  been \nin accounting  since 1946.  I've had a  large  amount  of \nexperience  with compiling  statistics. \nI  was  employed  by Dallas  County  to compile  statis \ntics,  using defendant's  exhibits  26,  27,  28,  and  29.  I \ncompiled defendant's  exhibit  number  30,  dealing with  the \nrecord of  fines  for  the City of Selma.  It is not  fruit \nful  to compare  these  fines  statistically within a  class \nof offense,  because  there  are  degrees  of  offense;  there \nare  degrees  of wrongdoing  within an offense.  Also,  the \nfifty-nine  parking violations listed in defendant's \nexhibit  number  30  should not  really be  considered.  They \nthrow  the  totals off. \nI  prepared defendant's  exhibit number  31,  a  recapitu \nlation of  fines  in the  Dallas  County Orirnin~ Court.  It \nshows  that  the  percentage  of persons  fined  by race  is  very \nclose  to  the  percentage  of population in the  county by \nrace.  In addition the  percentage  of  fines  under  fifty \ndollars was  very close  to  the  population  figures  by  per \ncentage  by  race.  The  percentage  of white  persons  fined \nfifty dollars  and  up  in the  county criminal  court  was \nmuch  higher  than  the  percentage  of white  population in \nthe  county. \nI  prepared defendant's exhibit number  32,  which  is \na  further  analysis  of county records.  It is  similar to \ndefendant's  exhibit  number  30  except  that  it is an \nana~ysis \nof  the  criminal  docket  for  the  county,  rather than for  the \ncity. \nI  prepared defendant's  exhibit number  33,  which  con \ntains  compilations of  juvenile  court  information from \ndefendant's  exhibit number  27. \nDefendant's  exhibit  number  34,  which  I  compiled,  is \na  recapitulation of  information  from  the  register of pri \nsoners  in the  county  jail.  It is necessary to know  the \nseriousness  of  the  charge  in a  particular case  to be  able \nto  evaluate  the  statistics.  No  bonds  was  listed unless \nthey appeared  on  the  records. \nC-53 \n\nl  took the  F.B.I\"s.  report,  \"Crime,\"  [Def.  Ex.No.  35] \n~rtd calculated the  percentage  of  persons  arrested  in 1963 \nwho  were  Negroes.  That  percentage was  28.76%.  I  do  not \nknow  whether  the  Negro  population in the  United States  is \n10%.  I  calculated that  the  percentage  of  persons  arrested \nin cities who  were  Negroes  was  30.4%.  This  calculation \nalso came  from  \"Crime\"  [Def.  Ex.  No.  36]. \nI  did not  analyze  how  many  persons  were  brought  to \ncity court  on  the  first Tuesday  after their arrests. \nJanuary,  March,  May  and  July were  chosen as  the \nmonths  to  be  used  in the  calculationof  statistics because \nof  the  time  problem.  I  don't know  whether  the  trials  in \nFebruary  and April  of Negro  demonstrators  would  change \nthe  calculation I  made. \nI  did  not  study statistics on  contributing. \nIn the  Dallas  County Criminal  Court,  my  figures  show \nthat ortly 4  of 1228  persons were  fined  over $100.  My \nfigures  also  show  that  there  ha.ve  been only  eight  continu \nances. \nMy  bond  information came  from  defendant's  exhibit \nnumber  28.  I  inadvertently omitted bond  information on \ncarrying concealed weapons  and  trespassing after warning. \nMy  working  papers  show  that  Floyd Wilson's  bond  for \ncarrying a  concealed weapon was  listed as  $500.  I  did \nnot  check  the  original  records  of bonds.  The  original \nbond  for Floyd Wilson,  does  appear  to be  $300. \nC-53-b \n\nE.  J.  DIXON \n{White) \nI 1ve  been an  investigator for  the  Alabama  Department \nof Public  Safety for  about  thirteen years.  I  was  a  state \ntrooper before  that. \nOn  the  afternoon of July 6,  I  was  with Sheriff Clark, \ninvestigator Head,  Major Jones,  and  probably  Deputy  Crocker. \nWe  saw  an old model  automobile  parked with  six boys  in it. \nWe  went  up  to  the  car,  and  Sheriff Clark  arrested  the  boys. \nThis  incident  occurred  in the  early afternoon  about  1:00 \nor 1:30 within a  block  or two  or three  of  the  railroad \nbridge.  There  was  an assortment  of clubs  and  nightsticks \nin the car.  There  was  a  second  license  tag  in the  car. \nThere  was  also a  hose  in the  caro  There  was  a  shoulder \npatch  in the  car which  I  was  later told was  a  Ku  Klux \nKlan  patch.  I  do  not  remember  the  residence  of  the  boys. \nI  haven't  heard anything concerning  the  incident  since. \nI  was  in Selma only that  one  afternoon. \nC-54 \n\nN.  B.  CHAMBERS \n(White) \nI'm a  police  captain.  I  was  on  the  watch  July 4-6. \nThat  put  me  in charge  of  the  radio  log.  On  July 4,  I \ncame  on watch  at  3:00  p.m.  There  is a  reference  in the \nlog  at  5:15  to the  r,ralton  Theater stating that. there  is \n\"gang  on  sidewalk.\"  The  first  reference  to  the \\'lilby \nTheater  in the  log  is at  5:32.  Between  that  and  6:00, \nthere  are  three entries  concerning  the ~Jilby.  The  log \nreflects  that  between  6:00  and  6:02,  four  cars,  44,100, \n11,  and  22,  came  to  the  vicinity of  the  Wilby Theater. \n44,  100,  and  22  are  patrol  cars.  Car 11  is an unmarked \ncar.  A captain or a  lieutenant  is usually  in it. \nAt  9:57  p.m.  there  is an  entry that  22  and  44 \nreceived a  a  call  that  a  car had  been hit with  a  bottle \nat  Small  and  Broad. \nOn  July 5,  I  wasยทon duty  from  3:00.  We  were  watching \nBennie Tucker.  All  the  entries  in the  radio  log dealing \nwith Bennie  Tucker on July 5  are:  ยท~~est from  Franklin \n6  to 8  walking-\";  'IWe  see  them\";  \"At vlalton now\"  \"Bennie \nis  at  Dallas  and  Broad\";  \"on way  back now\";  \"at City Bldg. \nin sta wagon. .. \";  and  \"bring one  of  those.\"  \"Those\"  refers \nto  pamphlets.  The  Police  Department  did get  a  copy of  the \nwhich  advertised the  meeting,  giving the  place, \npamphlet~ \ntime,  and  speaker. \nNo  officers had  been assigned to  follow  Bennie  Tucker, \nbut  one  of  the  police  cars  just happened  to  see  h~.  The \ncars had  no  instruction regarding Tucker.  The  unusual  fact \nwas  that Tucker was  taking  carloads  of five  and  six  to  the \nTheater.  I  knew  this although I  did not  leave  the  office \nand  \"most\"  of my  information came  from  the  radio  log. \nAt  9:48  p.m.  there  is an entry concerning car 11,  on \nLawrence;  \"Negro  hit  car with coke  bottle.\"  At  9:57,  there \nis the  following  entry,.  \"Curfew Area  710  Green,  on authority \nof Sheriff Clark.\"  I  went  off watch  at 11:00.  At  11:10 \nthere  is an entry in handwriting  of  B.  N.  Bobo  stating that \ntwo  cars were  to be  dispatched to  the  GWC  Project.  There \nwas  a  bottle  thrown  and  some  window  breakage. \nC-55 \n\nWILLIA1'1  YELDER \n(Negro) \nI've been  principal  of R.  B.  Hudson  High School  for \nnine years.  On  September  16,  1963,  there were  917  absentees \nfrom  a  total of 1517  students.  At  that  time  of  the  year \nthe  daily absenteeism  averages  around  100.  On  September  17 \nthere were  485  students  absent.  Attendance  returned  to \nnormal  about  October  8th.  The  period of high absenteeism \nwas  during  the time  of  the demonstrations.  Police  and \nSheriff  cars  returned  children to  school  \"several times.\" \nOccasionally  children left school when  the  police  left the \nschool.  Judge  Reynolds  talked with ce  several  times  about \nabsenteeism,  but  did  not  so  far  as  I  know  look at the  absentee \nism  records.  I  kept  the  individual  names  of  the  absentees  in \nmy  records.  The  Superintendent  of  schools  also  had  the  names \nof  the  absentees.  I  don't  know  if the  superintendent  gave \nthe  names  to Reynolds.  I  did not  testify in Juvenile  Court. \nC-56 \n\nJAMES  CLARK \n(\\-.'hi te) \nI've been sheriff of  Dallas  Oounty  a  little over \nnine years.  I  attended  the University  of Alabama  and \nJones  Law  School. \nThe  sheriff's department  operates  five  cars.  The \nrad:i'.os  are  on  the  state  trooper network.  Calls  go  out \nfrom  the  sheriff's  office when  it is open;  when  the \nsheriff's  offi.ce closes,  calls go  out  from  the  jail radio. \nThere  is  always  someone  on one of  the  radios. \nI  heard  about  the  meeting  of  the  National  State \nRights  Party  from.  a  handout.  I  instructed my  deputies \nto  cover  the meeting  \"exactly like\" thc.y  covered  Negroes \nmeetings.  I  was  at the National  Sheriffs'  Convention, \nmyself,  so  I  could  not attend  the meeting. \nI  have  ne'\\~er seen  Selma  so  tense  as  it wยทas  on  July Lf.~ \nMy  office was  patrolling all day.  There were  groups  of. \nwhites  all day.  My  office dispersed a  crov1d  at the Walton \nTheater.  Groups  when asked  to  would  junt move  a \nmov~ \nlittle bit.  The  majority were  \"rough looking\"  characters. \nThe  tense  situation lasted all afternoon.,  The  sheriff's \noffice had no  way  to enforce its \not~ers. \nI  was  in my  office when  Mr.  Warren called from  the \nThirsty Boy  and  said that he had  told a  group  of Negroes \nto move  from  tm parki.ng lot.  I  got :tn  my  car with  Rufus \nHead  and  started  toward  the Thirsty  Boy.  On  the  way,  I \nreceived  a  call.  that  there were  Negroes  in the  lunchroom. \nDeputy Hews ten was  already  there;  he  and  were \nl~arren \ntalking,  and  \\varren  was  signing  some  papers. \nI  saw  three  Negroes  at a  table  and  one  leaning  over \nthe  counter.  I  told  the  Negroes,  go,  you're under \n'~et's \narrest.\"  They  just sat there,  so  I  prodded  them..  The \ncattle prod  is the  safest way  to move  recalcitrant people. \nCattle prods  are  bought  through  a  law enforcement  sales \nhouse.  We  had  to use  cattle prods  to get  the students  in \nthe  car.  One  of  them  tried  to kick me.  The  names  of  the \nstudents  had  to  be  filled in at the  time  of  booking.  The \ncharges  were  filled in before hand.  This  is  common  prac \ntice,  as  in distilling and  traffic cases.  Bond  was  set \nimmediately.  The  prisoners  did  not make  bond  immediately~ \nThere was  no  trial that  I  remember.  The  people were \nsearched  in jaj.l.  One  had  a  sling  shot.  I  have  attended \nseveral  seminars  where  the  reports were  that  \"they\"  use \nthem  in riots  in the  North.  It is easy far  ยทthe.  person  to \nsay  it is a  bicycle chaine \nC-57 \n\nI  knew  that  the Civil  Rights  Act  had  been passed,  but \nI  did not  know  that  it gave  Negroes  the  right  to eat  in \nrestaurants  serving  interstate customers.  It was  being \nchanged  all along,  but  I  didn't know  what  finally went  in \nit. \nI  did not  l(now,  either that the  Civil :Rights Act  gavโขa \nNegroes  the  right  to attend the ltJilby Theater.  I  knew \nthere  was  a  potential  riot  there,  and  that was  my  only \nconcern. \nt.Je  received several  reports  concerning  the  theater. \nI  was  there  several  times.  I  was  watching Alvery l.Jilliams; \nWilliams was  moving  among  the  groups,  motioning people  to \ncome  over.  He's  an active  agitator;  he's not  a  native  of \nSelma.  Inspector Head  and  posseman Suther were  with me. \nI  was  driving east on  Selma Avenue;  when  I  little to \nwas'~ \nthe  right\" of the  theater,  V.Jilliams  yelled at me.  He  said \nthat he  wanted  protection.  I  couldn't  see  anything but  a \ngroup  of  Negroes.  I  asked Williams  if he  wanted  to  sign \na  warrant.  Uilliams-said no.  I  had  the  warrants  with me \nin the  car;  I  did not  ask Williams  to  come  to the  court \nhouse.  I  then heard Negroes  yell,  ''Let 1 s  get  'em.\"  I \nradioed  for help and  got  out.  I  tried to  disperse  the \ncrowd.  I  did not  see  the whites  or Negroโขas  with weapons. \nI  swung  my  nightstick to  scare  people.  My  office  tried to \nclear the whole  area.  I  moved  whites  from  across  the \nstreet.  I  then talked with  Mr.  Butler. \nIt was  a  dangerous  situation;  cars with  joy riders \nkept  going  back and  forth. \nI  did not  go  into the  theater itself.  I  did not  know \nwhether  there l-1ere  any Negroes  inside.  I  returned and \ntalked again with Butler.  Butler wanted me  to  put  some  men \nin the  theater.  I  did not  think that  it ยทwas  wise,  because \npeople  would  say the  officers were  blocking the  entrance. \nButler or I  suggested shutting do~m the  tiol:et W1ndow. \nMy  object  that  day was  to get  by without  violence. \nMy  office  dispersed everyone  with  no  business  there.  I \ncontinued to  patrol  that  night.  The  situation eased up \nin the  area of the  Hilby Theater,  but  no  'Where  else  in \nto~~.  I  heard  about  the  bottle  and  the Corsons. \nIn 1963,  there  was  a  meeting  at  the  Tabernacle  Church. \nThere  was  an overflow crowd.  I  had  information about  out \nside whites.  I  did not  talk to Judge  Hare  about  going  to \nthe meeting.  I  do  not  know  whether  Judge  Hare  listened on \nthe  radio.  We  see  each other all  the  ttme;  we've  been \nneighbors.  I  went  to  the meeting  and  later called the  posse. .โข \nThere  were  several  out-of-county cars.  During  the meeting, \nI  received a  request  for  protection from Negroes.  I  tried \nto get  the  whites  to move;  when  they did not,  I  called the \nreserves.  The  whites  then moved  back,  and  there  was  no \nincident. \nC-57-b \n\nI  have  tried to give  protection in other instances \nwhen  requested  to do  so;  I  have  been  \"severely criticized\" \nfor  providing  protection for  Negroes.  There  have  been no \nkillings;  Green Street was  the only time  there  were  injuries. \nMy  office has  attended all mass  meetings  it knew  about \nsince Hay 1963.  The  officers did not  always  take  notes  of \nthe  meetings. \nI  instructed the  same  coverage  of the  Green  Street \nmeeting  as  the other mass  meetings.  I  was  not  feeling \ngood  that night,  so I  remained  in my  office.  When  I \nreceived a  call about  trouble,  I  went  to the meeting.  The \ntear gas  surprised me. \nI  saw  the  t'VJ'o  newsmen  and  heard  they were  going  to  the \nhotel.  I  ordered a  car to lead  them there.  I  had  no  con \nversation with  them. \nIf force  had  not  been used,  things would have  gotten \nworse.  There  were  dark alleys where  the  rocks  had  come \nfrom. \nI  think I  was  in a  car by myself. \nRalph Abernathy was  at  the  meeting  at Mt.  Ararat  Church \nthe  night  of July 6.  Gildersleeve  was  there.  He  asked  if \nthe  sheriff's office was  going  to  protection.  I \nprovidE~ \ntold him  that we  could  not  \"stand for\"  more  rock and bottle \nthrO'I:ยทdng.  I  stayed  there until  about  the  time  the  meeting \nbroke  up.  I  later received a  report  of  rock  throwing. \nt~ile I  was  at  the  meeting,  I  learned of  rock throwing,  over \nthe  fence  of a  chicken yard.  I  saw  a  person  throwing  rocks \nand broken bricks  into the  churchyard.  It looked  as  if they \nwere  piling rocks  for  further  throwing. \nOn  the  afternoon of July 6, ยท Naj ..  Jones,  Lt.  Dixon,  and \nHead  tvere  with me  when  we  arrested six whites.  The  car in \nwhich  the  whites were  arrested had  an out-of-state  tag. \nThere  was  an Alabama  tag  in the  car.  There  was  a  shoulder \nbadge,  which  I  later learned 'tl1as  a  Ku  Klux  Klan  badge  from \nGeorgia.  The  men  arrested were  from Perry County, \nL~abama. \nI  charged  the men  with  carrying  a  concealed weapon.  Later, \nin discussing  the  matter with HcLeod,  I  was  not  too  sure  the \nweapons  were  \"concealed,\" but  I  thought  it best  to confine \nthe men.  McLeod  told me  the  weapons  would  not  qualify as \n\"concealed\". \nI  did not  investigate  to  see whether  the  tags  were \nproper.  Some  deputies  did,  but  I  do  not  remember  what  they \nfound. \nI  had  instructed Chief  Deputy Crocker  that  sureties \nfor bonds  must  have  enough  real  estate free  ann  clear..  There \nis  no  record of  the  holdings  of  the  sureties on  the  bonds  for \nthe whites,  but  the  bonds  contain affidavits. \nC-57-c \n\nDuring  the week  of July 6,  the Dallas  County  Grand \nJury,  the  Circuit  Court,  and  the Board of Registrars \nwere  in session at various  times.  The  Grand  Jury was  prob \nably not  in session every day  of  the week.  I  am  sure  the \nCircuit Court was  in session,  although  I  do  not  whether \nl~now \nthere was  a  jury session.  Reporters  told us  pickets were \ncoming  at a  certain time.  There was  a  registration line \nand court was  in session,  so we  arrested the  pickets_ \nAfter  the  pickets were  arrestedโข  a  large group  of people  on \nthe  steps  started singing and  carrying on,.  \"They wouldn't \nstop,\" so  I  had  them arrested.  I  up  several signs. \npicl~ed \nNone  said anything  about  the  Circuit  Court  or  the  Grand  Jury. \nSeveral  of  them had my  name  on  them.  Yes  T could  them \n~ing \ntomorrow.  These  pictures  [Def.  Ex.  Nos.  44-A  and 44-B]  have  no \ndate  on  them.  ยทยทThey  show  pickets with  signs.  The  first one \nsays,  \"One  Man  One  Vote  Register Now.\"  These  [Def.  Ex.  No.  45] \nshow  groups  of people by  the  courthouse  and  on  the Post  Office \nDrug  corner.  '\"\"we  made  charges  of  interfering with court\" \nagainst  all persons  arrested.  That's  a  city.charge.  No \ncharges  made  concerning  the  Board  although we \no~ Registrars~. \ncould have.  \"\\,Jhen  they  came,  they brought\" several young \nchildren;  I  could have  made  a  contributory charge  concerning \neach child,  but did not.  My  main  purpose was  to get people \noff the  street,  not  to  throw  the book  at them.  There was  a \nlot of disturbance,  and  I  wanted peace. \nI  set bond  as  fast  as  possible.  1r1e  set the  same  bond \nfor  all persons,  because  lV'e  didn't know  the  individual  facts \ntoo well.  He  used LaPorte  and  other  city men.  He  used  the \ncounty  jail because  of  its size.  The  violation charged was \na  city violation!  so  city affidavits  had  to be  used.  A \n$500  bond was  orkginally set because  the  charge was  of  a \n\"serious  nature\";  as  soon  as  I  found  that $300  was  the \nmaximum  for  city charges,  bond was  reduced.  Peter Hall \nworked with me  amicably  on  the  bond.  Hall was  always  told \nhe  could  bond.  Monday,  we  agreed  to  lower  bonds  on \nm&~e \nthe  suggestion of  Judge Allgood.  Then  Judge  Thomas  came \nu.s. \nback,  and  the  Court  took  jurisdiction.  I  never refused \nbond.  I  never  put Hall  off;  I  never  told him he  could not \nget bond.  I  did not want  to keep  people  in jail, but  \"just \nwanted  to restore  order.\"  In fact,  Dallas  County  told me \nto get  the  prisoners  out of  jail. \nI  worked  \"very closely\" with Blanchard HcLeod  in July, \n1964.  If possible,  we  discussed charges.  It may  be  that \non  July 6,  I  talked over  the  charges  with him.  He  assisted \nin some  arrests.  I  prepared the  questionnaires  used  in the \njail.  McLeod  may  have  seen them. \nI  made  the  decision  on  the  contributing charge.  \"They \nwalked  down  together;  they were  all there  together.\"  A \nchild goes  with  an  adult  only when  led. \nMy  office did as  much  investigation as  possible,  but \nthere was  not much  time.  There were  so many  arrested \nper.~ons \nand  so many  incidents. \nC-57-d \n\nI  am  not  sure  of  the reasons  for  a  $200  bond  being \n.listed oh  th~ booldng  sheets  for some  of  the  persons  arrest. .. \ned when  they were  picketing.  I  don't know  why  an  additional \n$200  bond  is listed for Gloria Bostick;  perhaps  she was  a \nrepeater.  I  don't know  about  The.odis  Hawkins;  a  lot of \ntypographical  errors  are made5  One  of  the bonds  for Frederick \nReese  is listed as  \"$200  peace\";  this  is not  a  peace  bond, \nbut  a  bond  for  peace  proceedingsf>  I  suppose  there  is a  ยท \nwarrant  to  support  the bond;  I  suppose  I  could find  it to \nnight. \nThe  sheriff is to  set bail on  all cases  except capi \ntal cases.  Blanchard McLeod  has  nothing udirectly\" to do \nwith bonds  until  a  case comes  to county court.  Judge  Hare \nhas  nothing to do  with setting bonds  in the  ordinary case; \nunless  there  is  a  grand  jury indictment.  I  have no  iron \nclad rules  on  bonds,  but  a  general  rule  is  that  the bond \nfor  traffic offenses  is  $100,  for misdemeanor  $300,  and  for \n\"serious misdemeanors\"  $500.  The  bond  for  felonies  is  $500 \nor more.  Several  bonds  are  personal;  Selma  Bail Bond  Com \npany  is  the main bond companyo  Anyone  can qualify as  a \nbondsman  if he meets  the  statutes.  Bonds  are  lower  for  Neg \nroes. \nThe  procedure upon  taking a  prisoner  to  jail is  to \ntake  him  to  the  booking desk,  empty his  pockets,  and  fill \nout a  booking  sheet.  A booking  sheet  is generally handwrit \ntent  then  typed  in triplicate.  One  copy goes  to  the  sheriff's \noffLce  for  the  officer's use.  one  goes  to  the  jail for  cross \nreference;  one  is a  work  sheet  that is corrected as  changes \nare made.  I  don't know  whether we  brought  the  correct book \ning sheets  to court.  Bond  is usually set at the  time  of \nbooking. \nIn the  summer  of  1964,  I  received 1'quite a  bit of \nintelligence\"  that extremists  \"from both races\"  wanted vio \nlence.  The  racial  situation eased up  after the  arrests  on \nJuly 6,  but it was  still tense.  There  was  a.  lot of  rock \nthrowing;  there were many  reports  of  incidentso  cf \nC::-c~ps \nwhites  were  planning  to  take  the  law  into  their own  hands. \nTherefore,  officials  petitioned for  an  injunction.  To  the \nbest of my  knowledge, 'information,  and  belief the complaint \nwas  true.o \nThe  situation before  the  injunction was  very tense. \nAfter the  injunction,  \"It eased off a  bit.\"  \"I  shudder to \nthink\" what would  have  happened if there had not been  an \ninjunction..  I  am  \"positive\"  there would  have  been serious \ntrouble without  it. \nI  don't know  whether  the  events  listed in the  complaint \nfor  the  injunction start with  the Hilby Theater.  Carol \nLawson  is a  Negro  female;  \"she was  working with a  group  of \nagitators.\"  I  had  information  to  that effect.  I \narr~oted \nher  at the Thirsty Boy;  that was  before  the tvilby  incide~n.l:. \nC-57-e \n\nThe  Henry Aronson  incident arose when  \"I  found  a  man \nthat didn't have  authority to  be  there\" at the  jail.  The \njailer said the man  was  the u.  s. Marshall,  but I  knew  he \nwas  not.  I  asked  the marshalls who  the man  was,  but  they did \nnot know.  I  asked Aronson  to  leave,  but he  would not.  There \nfore,  I  grabbed him  and escorted him  out  of  the  jail.  Ex\"!' \ncept  in emergencies,  there  are no  visitors allowed in  the \njail except  on  Sundays.  Attorneys,  law enforcement  officers, \ndoctors,  and  preachers  are  allowed  in the  jail if they state \ntheir business.  Aronson  did not  say he  was  representing the \npeople  in  jail.  I  did not know  he was  a  lawyer. \nI  remember  \"nothing whatsoever\"  about  kicking Charles \nJohnson. \nI  heard about  the  testing of  Carter Drug  and  the  Glass \nHouse  only from  hearsay..  The  radio log entry,  ucontact  the \nChief  Ref.  Leo  Taswยทell\",  does  not  refresh my  recollection, \nat all.  [Upon  being  shown  the.next  entry,  \"Contact Hajor \nRichardson\":]  Major Richardson was  in my  office nearly every \nday,  at my  invitation. \nThere  was  a  meeting  after the injunction in Colonel \nAult's office.  Col. Ault,  Col.  CUrtis,  Maj.  Richardson,  and \nMaj.  Ely,  the  \"Commisar\" were  present.  lยท1ajor  Richardson \nhad asked me  how  the  injunction would  affect the base.  I \nproposed a  meeting.  Major Richardson invited Judge  Hare. \nI  brought up  the  subject  of  the meeting of  the Negro  Airman \nat  the  Elk's  Club.  Col. Ault  appeared quite disturbed.  I \nsuggested we  might  look  into it.  Col. Ault  told Naj. \nRichardson to cooperate  as  far  as military regulations  would \nallow.  There was  a  general  discussion.  Judge  Hare  had not \nmuch  to  say,  except  interpreting some  phrases  of  the  injunc \ntion.  He  made  no  request  that  the Air Force  enforce  the  in \njunction.  Hare  did not  throw  the weight of  his  office \nagainst Craig;  \"quite  the contrary\";  he  said the  only pur \npose  of his  injunction was  to  keep  the  peace.  The  meeting \nlasted about  two  hours. \nAfter going  to  the meeting  at Craig,  I  went  to  take \nthe  license.  I  am  not  sure whether  I  discussed  taking the \nlicense with Blanchard NcLeod.  I  did not discuss  it with \nJudge  Hare. \nI  had  heard about  a  meeting attended by Rev.  Smeltzer. \nI  talked with him  once;  \"his actions  didn't prove''  he  was \nfor better race  relations.  It seemed  to me  as  if Smeltzer \nwas  \"always  around when  trouble  arises.\"  ''v.7ith  Smeltzer's \nreputation,  we  thought we'd better look into\"  the meeting. \nI  don't know  what  was  discussed at the meeting.  I  talked \nwith  the ABC  and  told them  I  thought  the man  had violated ยท \nthe  injunction.  Ralph Shuttles,  Chief  of  the License  Divi \nsion of ABC,  told me  he  thought  I  could pull  the  license \nand  send it in.  I  did not  revoke  the license,  but merely \npulled it.  Regulation  36,  ยง2,  ABC  Rules  of 1964  provides \nthat  any  law  enforcement  officer can  go  to  the  premises  of \na  place with an ABC  License without  a  warrant.  I  went with \nJ. L.  Chestnut,  Sr.  and  J. L.  Chestnut,  Jr., who  is a  lawyer. \nI  broke  down  no  doors  and  broke no  locksw  I  had no warrant. \nThe  Chestnuts'  knew  nothing about  the meeting. \nMy  men  could  find nothing from  the  airmen. \nC-57-f \n\nI  held  the  license.  Some  people  asked me  to  hold \nthe  license  and not  to  send  it in.  I  agreed with members \nof  the  Elks  Club  to wait until Moss  returned.  Hoss  said \nthat  ignorance was  behind  any wrongdoing.  Since  then, \nthe  Elks  Club  has  been  straight down  the  line. \nJudge  Hare  once  asked me  to bring  to him  students \nfrom  Selma University who  had been  arrested.  The  meeting \ntook place  around nine  in the  evening.  Judge  iiallory \nand  Judge Hare were  there.  Judge  Hallory had no  probation \npower,  so  the  students were  turned  over to  Judge  Hare. \nI  have  seen  no  acts whatsoever  committed by  Judge \nHare  to  vlolate Negroes'  rightso  In  some  cases,  Judge  Hare \nwill put a  Negro  on  probation where  he would  put  a  white \nin  the  penitentiary.  I  have  seen  no  acts  whatsoever  com \nmitted against Negroes  during  racial difficulties.  Judge \nHare  has  nothing  to  do  with County  Cburts  or  the  City Court, \nthe  only Courts of preliminary  jurisdiction in Selma. \nSolicitor 11cLeod  has  requested  that I  report serious \ncrimes  to  him  for  investigation.  I  have  never seen McLeod \nas  circuit solicitor,  abuse  any Negro.  I  think HcLeod \nhas  nol prossed  ยท  too  many  cases  against Negroes.  I  have had \nlittle contact ,;nth Judge  Reynolds  except  cases  of  juveniles \nand  insane  persons.  I  have  n.ever  seen Reynolds  handle \nNegroes  differently  than whites. \nThe  City of Selma has  always  cooperated with me.  The \nPolice  Department  has  dispatched cars  many  times.  Hy  agree \nment with  Chief Hullen was  based on  the  fact  tb.s.ยท  Code \nspecified that the  Sheriff  is  the Chief  Law  Enforcement \nOfficer  in the  County.  I  was  in charge,  but my  office \nalways  consulted the  police.  There  was  no  agreement  the \ncity would  not  act  to  protect Negroes;  there was  never  any \nrelinquishment of  authority.  The  city does  not  have  an \nadequate  force  to  handle most  of  its routine work  and \nincidents  such as  the  one  Selma had.  As  I  stated in  the \nMcLeod  case,  the  Sheriff was  to  direct both the Police \nDepartment  and  the  Sheriff's Department,  and  they work \ntogether.  The  city never gave  up  its patrol work  to me. \nSelma's  Police  jurisdiction extends  three miles  beyond  its \nborders.  Selma has  grown  considerably,  but  the Police \nForce has  not. \nThere  have  been many  outside  Negroes  in  the County. \nI  remember vJolf  Dawson  the best.  I  remember  arresting \nBernard Lafayette  for vagrancy,  I  think,  in June,  1963., \nIt was  a \"constant thing\"  for newsmen  to  say  they were \ninformed by Atlanta  that there would be  trouble,  not  just \npickets,  but  trouble.  Once  TV  men  came  from  all over. \nThere  was  real trouble  that afternoon.  There  had been \n\"just isolated trouble\"  that morning. \nยทIn September 1963  I  was  in  charge  of  the  arrests.  MY \noffice was  arresting  people  coming  out of  the Churcl't  two  by \ntwo  for marching.  There  were many  other arrests,  but  I \nc-s7 .. \ng \n\ndo  not remember  whether  they were  for  picketing or Breach \nof  Peace  or what. \nI  arrested Benny  Tucker  in the white washroom for \ncriminal  provocation. \nI  now  have  nine  field deputies.  During  1964,  I  had \neight regular deputies  andยทfour hired on specially.  I \nhad four  deputies  and  several special deputies  l-7hen  I \nstarted the  job.  In July  196L~ we  could not,  I  think,  have \nhandled  the  situation without  the  posse.  He  did not  need \nthe  National  Guard. \nI  organized  the  posse.  There had been no  racial  . \nproblems  before  the  posse  was  formed.  There had been two \nincidents,  not  racial,  that needed more  men  than  the \nsheriff's office had.  There  are four  major  divisions  to \nthe  posse.  The  mounted  posse  consists  of  people  interested \nin horeshows  and  parades.  The  land rescue  posse  grew out \nof  the  flood  of  1961.  Its members  helped hunt for  lost \nchildren and engaged  in Civil Defense work.  The  water  posse \nwas  formed  after the  Sheriff's office had  to call on  Chillum \nCounty  for help when  a  man  fell off a  trestie in the Alabama \nRiver  and drowned  in 1960.  The  posse  dragged for bodies \nin 1961;  it helped  to rescue  3,000 people  in the  flood. \nIn the  Spring  of  1964,  it rescued several hundred  persons \nin a  flood.  The  dismounted  posse  is \"more  or  less  reserve \nforce.\"  The  entire posse  is composed  of volunteers โข . I \nhave  no  voice  in appointing members  or  officers  of  the  pease. \nI  do  \"reserve  the right  to  turn anyone  down\"  for  bad back \nground  or misbehaviQr. ยท About  twenty-four  members  of  the \nposse  have  been expelled for  misbehavior.  Host  of  these \nwere  dropped by  the  screening committee,  not by  the  sheriff. \nCivil  Defense  has  t&~en over many  of  the  functions  of  the \nwater posse  and  land rescue  posse;  that  operation carries \non many  civil defense  classes. \nSolicitor NcLeod  and  I  have  held classes  in the  law \nof  arrests  and  search and  seizure.  Posse  are  instructed \nnot  to  t&~e the  law  in their own  hands.  Its members  are \ntold  that  they  are  to  \"enforce  the  law  at all ti.mes  without \nany  discrimination whatsoever.\" \nThe  posse  almost  always  has  experienced  law men  with \nit. \nSince  Nay  1963,  I  have  used the  posse  outside  Dallas \nCounty  on racial matters.  I  took  the  posse  to Tuscaloosa \nwhen  the  University  of Alabama was  integrated.  The  posse \nwas  with me  for  \"some  time\" in Birmingham.  Some  possemen \nwere with me  in Tuskegee  the  time  wbe.h  school  desegre \ngation had been ordered.  I  went  to Notasulga at the  time \nNegroes  went  to school  for  the  first time;  no  possemen were \nwith me  at that time. \nc-57-h \n\nJANES  BARE \n(White) \nI'm fifty-eight.  I'm circuit  judge  for  the  Fourth \nJudicial  Circuit.  The  circuit  is composed  of five  counties, \nincludin~ Dallas.  L.  S.  Moore  is the  presiding  judge.  I \nam  the  associate  judge.  It isยท customary  far  one  of \nthe  judges  to  stay in.  this county.  Sixty-five  to  seventy \npercent  of  the:  litigation is  in Dallas County.  Since  the \nsummer  of l95Liยท,  I 1ve  been a  circuit  judge.  I  was  circuit \nsolicitor for  about  eight  years  before  that.  I  spent  four \nyears  as  a  legal  officer  in the Air  Force,  retiring as  a \nmajor.  I  was  in the Alabama Attorney General's office. \nI  graduated  in law  from  the  University of Alabama.  Under \nSection 157  of'  the  Alabama Constitution,  I'm the highest \nconservator of the  peace  in the  circuit.  Going  back  to  the \ncommon  la~.,,  I  assume  I  would  call out  the  National  Guard  or \ninvoke  marshal  law. \nI  deal  with punishment  and  probation matters  in my \ncourt.  Those  matters  are  generally within my  discretion. \nI  have  some  fairly set  policies;  for  example:  burglary \nand  larceny are  normally probationary offenses.  The  court \nhas  a  trained probation worker  to conduct  some  investigation \nfor each person to be  sentenced.  I  do  not  hold Negroes  to \nthe  same  degree  of  accountability as  whites.  I  am  much \nmore  lenient  on probation for Negroes  than for whites, \nsince  Negroes  are better for  probation than are whites. \n\"I have  not\" used my  office  to discriminate  against  Negroes \nin any way. \nPeter Hall  handled  four  or five  racial  cases  on appeal \nbefore me.  I  do  not  recall  any  other racial  cases. \nI  spend most  of my  time  in Dallas County,  and  am  re \nquired by law to have  four  criminal  and  four  civil  jury \nsessions  annua.lly.  There  is hardly any day  of  the  year \nduring which  the  court  is not  in session.  Equity takes \nabout  seventy percent  of my  time.  Circuit  court  was  in \nsession July 6. \nI  have  never  given any  advice  to the  sheriff on how  to \nhandle  pickets.  [After an  excerpt  from his  testimony begin \nning  on  page  Liยท83  of the  record  in the NcLeod  case  was  read \nto him'' Hare  stated:]  On  one  occasion,  the  Sheriff came  up \nand  asked  for my  opinion.  I  had  advised  the  Sheriff not \nto  act,  that  picketing was  not  in itself illegal,  in the \nabsense  of  \"some  turmoil  or congregation of  people  or \nsomething.\"  I  think that's the  only time  I  gave  advice  to \nthe  sheriff concerning  the  handling of pickets.  [To  the \nquestion,  Did  Sheriff Clark come  to your  office  in July:] \nMr.  Doar,  I  have  had  numerous  conferences  with the  sheriff., \nBlanchard McLeod,  and  the Chief of  Police.  \"I  felt  it wasยท \nmy  duty\"  as  chief conservator of the  peace  to keep  informed. \nC-58 \n\nDuring  the  past  two  years  I  have  received reports \nfrom  time  to  time  concerning  the  \"racial situation\" in \nSelma.  I  \"personally received some  intelligence\"  con \ncerning a  paratroop drop  by  the  J.Olst Airborne  Division \nin \"early September\"  1963ยท~  I  \"considered it a  matter \nof  the utmost  gravity.\"  I  called the  sheriff and  the \nforeman  of  the grand  jury into my  office.  I  asked  the \nsheriff to make  discreet  inquiries.  I  made  contact \nwith Congressman Armistead Seldon,  a  friend,  and Congress \nman  George  Huddleston.  I  received  communication from \nSeldon with  an  attached  letter from  the Department  of \nthe Army,  defendant's  exhibit No.  46.  ~Jhile the  contem \nplated air-drop was  to have  taken place in the  first week \nof  September,  1963,  the  letter of response  from  the Depart \nment  of the Army  came  in March  or April  of 1964.  Up  until \nSeptember  16,  1963,  it had been a  \"lethargic  summer.\" \nOn  September  27  or  28,  1963,  I  observed  a  television \ncamera by  the  Chevrolet Company  near  the  courthouse  on  the \nway  back  from  lunch.  Up  to  that  time  it had  been  a  very \nnormal  day.  I  saw  another  television truck across  the \nstreet.  A member  of  one  of  the  television crews  told me, \n\"I  don't know v1hy  I  came,  but  'you  can be  damn  sure  I \ndidn't  come  all the way  from Atlanta'  to  take  pictures of \npickets.\"  I  walked  on  and  observed many  strangers  in front \nof  the  courthouse.  One  said \"all hell was  supposed  to bust \nloose within an hour.\"  I  understand,  although I  did not \nsee  it,  that  there was  some  disturbance  later.  I  haven't \ngiven any  instructions  to  officers  concerning race matters. \n\"No,  sir,  I  purposely  stayed out  of  it\" as  far  as  I  could. \nOnce,  in connection with  the Tabernacle  Church, \nSheriff  Clark urged me  to  come  down  to  the meeting.  I \ncalled John Randolph  Smith,  a  local  attorney,  asked  for \nhis  advice,  and he  took me  to  the  church.  I  suggested \nClark deputize enough men  to  take  care  of  the  situation \nand  then left.  [Asked  about  the  Church  again on  cross.] \nThe  Sheriff asked me  to  come  to  the  Church.  I  came  with \nSmith  and was  in an  auto within a  block  of  the  Church. \n[After his  testimony  in the McLeod  case  was  read  tc him:] \nYes,  I  called the Sheriff  and  told him  to  be  at  the meeting. \nI  listened to  one  radio  broadcast.  [Upon  being read his \ntestimony  in McLeod:]  ~~en I  said I  listened to  radio \nbroadcasts,  that  applied  to  one  meeting,  where  Dick Gregory \nspoke.  Yes,  I  testified I  would  sit at  the Sheriff's  office \nand  listen on  the radio  to every word.  I  meant  that I  heard \nDick Gregory.  Yes,  in the HcLeod  trial I  said I  read notes \nof  the  meetingse  I  meant  in particular  that  I  read notes  of \na  speech Rev.  Hunter  told me  he  had made. \n\"I've been approached  any number  of  times\"  by whites \nand  Negroes  both.  Once,  Attorney James  Chestnut  asked \nme  to  hel~ him with  the  problem of  police surveillance \nof Negro  mass  meetings.  I  contacted Breckenridge's  office \nin Birmingham.  The  office  sent  a  memorandum which was \nof no  use.  I  called Breckenridge  again,  and  he  sent  another \nopLnLon.  I  supplied copies  of  that  to  Chestnut,  tne  Sheriff~s \noffice,  and  the Police  Department. \nC-58-b \n\nJudge  Reynolds  asked me  for  advice  quite  often, \nespecially on matters  concerning  incorrigible  juveniles, \nand  estates.  Once  Judge  Reynolds  told me  that  he  was \n\"utterly swamped\".  He  asked me  if I  could look  at  the \ncode  and  see  whether  there  was  any  provision for  relief \nof  the  probate  judge.  The  probate  judge  is very busy; \nhe  is  ex-officio head  of the  Board  of Revenue.  Judge \nReynolds  is not  a  lawyer.  I  suggested  that  Reynolds \nappoint  referees  when  he  was  swamped,  as  the  code  pro \nvides  for  that.  I  later found  that  Reynolds  had  done \nthis. \nOn  another  occasion,  I  received  a  letter from  a  man \nrepresenting himself  as  a  local  representative  of  the \nNational  States Rights  Party.  He  asked me  about  a  busi \nness  licenseo  I  referred  the  matter  to  Robert  Frye  of \ntm  F.B.I.,  then dictated a  \"casual  letter\" telling him \nI  had  nothing  to  do  with  business  licenses. \nc. \nOn  another  occasion,  Dr.  Owens  and  Rev.  C.  Brm~ \ncontacted me.  Owens  is President  of the  Selma University \nand  Brown  is a  colored minister  in Selma.  Dr.  Owens  was \nconcerned  about  students  arrested  in the  fall  of 1963  for \ndemonstrating.  I  explained  that  the  cases were  not  in my \njurisdiction,  but  that  I  would  contact McLeod,  Clark,  and \nJudge  N:allory  in whose  court  the  cases  were  to be  heard. \nHugh  Mallory  is  the  judge  of  the  Dallas County Court,  an \ninferior court  created with  preliminary  jurisdiction. \nI  have  no  superintendence  over  that  court  except  on  appeal. \nI  get  cases  from  that  court  only on appeal  or by  the grand \njury.  Since  Judge  l1allory had  no  probation power  and  since \nthe  only way  I  could have  jurisdiction without  action by \nthe  grand  jury was  on  appeal,  Mallory,  HcLeod,  Clark,  and  I \nworked  out  an  arrangement  whereby  students  would  plead \nguilt.y  in Judge  Hallory's  court.  Then  they appealed  and \nI  released twenty-three  of  the  t~1enty-five or twenty-six \nstudents  on  their own  recognizance.  It might  be,  that  the \nstudents  sign $300  bonds,  but  I  do  not  know  that.  I  told \nthem  I  was  putting no  restriction on  any  of  them  except  or. \nthe  request  of  Dr.  Owens.  I  did  say  I'd deal  severely with \nthe  students  if they decoyed  children a-c;..ray  from  school. \nI  might  have  heard,  informally,  that  the  first SNCC \nworker  in to~ยฅn was  arrested  for  vagrancy.  I  knew  that  the \npersons  working  among  Negroes  were  engaged  in voter  regis \ntration drives  and  encouraging  people  to  vote.  I  understand \nthat  some  of  the  demonstrations had  nothing  to  do  with voting. \nThroughout  the  period  from  September  of 1963  the  racial \ncondition was  \"deteriorating.\"  In July 1964,  I  became  aware \nthat  the  ''general  racial  condition\"  had  worsened.  There  had \nbeen provacative  incidents;  the  National  States  Rights  Party \nheld  a  meeting;  there were  outside Ku  Klux  elements  in town. \nUp  to  that  time,  none  of the  white  citizens  and  no  respon \nsible  Negro  citizens had  been  involved. \nC-58-c \n\nThe  situation was  \"very tense\"  after July  2.  The \nfeeling 'tv-as  high  that  Selma needed  an injunct ion or \nmartial  1 a1.  I  kne~;r that  the  Civil  Rights Act  had been \npassed.  I  wยทas  a'tV'are  that  it applied  to  theaters  and \nrestaurants  serving  interstate customers.  I  was  aware \nNegroes  were  arrested for  trespassing  at  Thirsty Boy. \nI  understood  from  an article by Hacon Heaver  that  tres \npass  laws  were  still in effect.  I  had heard  that  Negroes \nhad  entered on  the white  side  and  sat  in the Wilby Theater. \nIn July,  Nr.  Pitts ยทt:ad'l.ed me .:and  -asl~~d if l  could \nhear him  on a  matter of  importance.  Pitts \nconsidera~le \nbrought  with him  some  handwritten affidavits.  Subsequently, \nPitts  presented  the  complaint  to me  with  a  verification. \nI  read  about  two-thirds  of  the  affidavits.  It was  not \nnecessary for me  to do  so,  but  I  normally like  for  the \ncourt  to be  appraised of  the  background.  I  did not  make \nany  list of  the  affidavits,  but  I  \"certainly did\"  take \nthem  into consideration.  It is common  for me  to  take  into \nconsideration affidavits  that  are  not  filed. \nI  signed  the  decree  on  the  sworn  bill of  complaint, \nbut  only after considerable  legal  research.  Clemens  v ... \nCOPยฃ  was  an important  case  in my  consideration.  I  spent \nabout  3  hours  in the  library and  shepardized virtually \nevery case  considered by the  court.  The applicants had \ndone  considerable legal  research.  My  decision to  issue \nthe  complaint  was  not  a  hasty one,  but  a  \"considered \njudgment.\"  The  injunction could have  been dissolved on \nproper  application.  Notion can be  made  for  a  hearing \nwithin  three  days.  The  National  States Rights  Party \ndemurred,  but  no  other  party did  anything  in the Circuit \nCourt.  No  party moved  to dissolve  or to  amend.  Instead, \nremoval  was  sought.  The  removal  did not  dissolve  the \ninjunction;  it is  still in effect. \n[After  stating again  the whites  were  not  involved before \nJuly 1  t'.nd  that  \"5ood Negroes\" were  not  involved  either:] \nI  have  been  a  of SeLma  for  years,  but  I  was \nres~dent  t~~e \nborn  and  reared  in  Dallas County.  I  am  familiar with  the \nclergy.  I  know  Rev.  Girard,  Mr.  Rhodes,  Rev.  Matthews, \nc.  c. \nHunter,  and Rev.  Brown.  At  the  time  of  the  injunction, \nc.c. \nI  did not know  of  participation and  agitation by  Brown, \nA.  B.  Rev.  Bradford,  Rev.  Minifee,  H.  B.  Plunkett, \n\\~itP-, \nJohn Crear,  and E.  L.  Moss.  I  think  I've met  Rev.  Minifee \nand have  known  E.  L.  Moss  for  years.  I  don't  know  whether \nE.  L.  lvloss  ~1as  an  \"agitating Negro\"  or a  \"good Negro.\" \nAny  of  those  persons \"t-Jere  free  to  come  in and  ask to be \nstricken from  the  injunction,  but  none  did.  As  to  the \nministers,  I  was  informed  that  they had  donated  or offered \ntheir churches  for  the  mass  meetings.  I  did  not  know  who \nthe  arrested people  were  at  the  Thirsty Boy  or outside  the \ncourthouse.  Neither did  I  know  the  SNCC  connection of the \npersons. \nC-58-d \n\nThere  is  nothing  in my  injunction to  prohibit  the \nexercise  of civil  rights.  It would  not  apply to the \nThirsty Boy  or  the Wilby Theater.  The  restriction is \nagainst  public  disorder.  It was  directed to  people \nengaged  in brawls.  It was  also directed against men \nlike  Dick Gregory,  Hartin Luther King,  and  James  Foreman, \nthe whole  \"parade  of galaxieso\"  I  could  sit down  and \ntalk with  the  ministers,  although  I  did not  know  very \nmany  of  them.  I  rarely know  the  persons  I  issue  an \ninjunction against.  This  injunction does  not  touch  voting.- \nin any manner.  I  never  intended  to  enjoin churches.  Theยท ยท \ninjunction does  11ot  affect  \"fraternal  orders  or  \"normal \nn \n7 \nlife .. \" \nMajor  invited me  to Craig Air Force  Base. \nRichardo~n \nRichardson  and  I  haa  discussed  police  jurisdiction in the \nN.B.F.  homes  several  times.  We  had had lunch  at Craig. \nI  have  been  by many  officers  at Craig.  Richardson \n~onsulted \nand  I  discussed  the  injunction,  and Richardson  then  in \nvited me  to Craig.  I  did not  try to  force  Craig  to enforce \nthe  injunction.  I  explained  that  I  think the  injunction \nis constitutional,  legal,  and  still  in.forQe.  I  think I \nadvised  I  thought  an  airman  could violate  the  injunction \nas  could anyone  else.  The  meeting  at  the  Negro  Elks Club \nmight  have  involved  a  violation of the  injunction.  I  did \nstate  that  \"the  only evidence  was  that  all  these  soldiers \nhad  taken the Fifth Amendment\"  when  they were  interrogated. \nThe  sheriff's office  or Major  Richardson had  interrogated \nthem;  I  was  not  then present.  At  the  meeting,  there was  a \ndiscussion about  the  state's right  of  process.  At  this \ntime  there  came  up  the  subject  of possible  grand  jury \ninvestigation.  Because  the  matter was  in federal  court, \nI  said that  the  County would  postpone  grand  jury action \nand  leave  the  investigation up  to  Craig.  It was  determined \nalso  that McLeod  would  withhold  action pending  Craig's \nown  determination of what  to  do. \nI  had no  information concerning  the  liquor license  of \nthe  Negro  Elks  Club until Mr.  Moss  called me.  I  did not \neven know  what Moss  wanted  to  see  me  about  until  he  got \nthere.  I  don't know  why  Moss  called me  unless  it was \nbecause  I  had  given an  address  of welcome  at  the  Negro  Elks \nConvention. \nC-58-e \n\nWilSON  BAKER \n(White) \nSince  October  5,  1964,  I've been Director of  Public \nSafety for  the  City  of Selma.  From 1940  to 1942  or 1943, \nI  was  a  claims  adjuster  for  the  Southern Railway.  I  was \nwith the Selma Police  from January  of  1946  to January  of \n1958.  From  then until  this year  I  taught  police work  in \nthe  vocational division of the  University of Alabama.  I \nlived  ยทhere  on weekends  while  teaching.  I've attended \nand  instructed seminars  at the  University,  in New  York \nCity,  Montgomery,  St.  Louis,  and  so  on.  I  attended \nNewburgh  College  in South Carolina and  the  University  of \nAlabama.  I've done  advanced work  at Rutgers  and  St. \nLawrence. \nIn September,  1963,  1  was  present for  about  two \ndays  during  picketing.  I  saw  \"quite  a  few  people \nparading  or  attempt  to  parade\" on  Lawrence  Street.  I \nsaw  an  arrest.  I  also saw  some  parading  on Broad Street \nand some  crowds  by  the  Standard Oil  Station.  It \n\"celC'tainly was\"  a  \"tense  situation.\"  I  saw no  physical \nabuse  to Negroes  during  the  arrest. \nIn July  1964,  I  knew  I  was  returning to Selma.  I \ntried to keep  in touch.  I  was  not here  on  the weekend  of \nJuly 4,  but was  here  on other weekends.  I  observed a \n\"very  tense\"  situation.  People  on both sides were  \"very \nexcited.\" \n[Upon  being  shown  Def.  Ex.  No.  1:]  Items  \"like \nthis,\" that  is,  a  chain with a  weight  attached,  can be \nused  as  a  slingshot.  [To  the  question whether he \ncon~ \nsidered this  a  dangerous  weapon]  It \"very definitely \ncould be  used as  a  dangerous  weapon.\"  It :is  standard \npractice to  question a  person arrested.  It would be \nstandard practice to  question about  the  chain with the \npadlock.  I  would  not necessarily accept  an explana\" \ntion without  checking  it.  I  \"certainly would\"  check \nan explanation before rejecting it. \nSince  I  became  Director of  Public  Safety for  the \nCity of  Selma on October  s,  1964,  there have  been  two \nracial incidents  on which  the  city police have  taken \naction.  One  occurred  December  19 when  non-resident whites \nbeat a  local white who  had expressed sympathy for  Negroes \ngoing  to  church.  The  police have  apprehended  the men \nwho  administered  the  beating and have  charged all except \none  who  is in the  hospital with robbery  and  assult with \nintent to commit  murder.  On  December  21,  1964,  there was \na  young  Negro  assaulted in front  of  the  Y.M.c.A.  in Selma. \nThe  city police apprehended  two  white  youths  and  have \nbooked them. \nC-59 \n\nBLANCHARD  McLEOD \n(Hhite) \nI'm Circuit Solicitor for  the  Fourth Judicial Circuit. \nI  live in Camden,  Wilcox  County. \nI  had been  attending  a  picnic  on July 4p  A highway \npatrolman  told me  to contact  the  sheriff,  who  told me  that \nAlvery \\-Jilliams  had  incited a  riot. \nAfter  I  arrived in Selma  on  July 4,  I  heard about a \nbottle  throwing  incidento  After that,  I  asked state  troopers \nto watch my  wife  and children on  their way  out  of town.  I \nhad  troopers  drive me  home  later. \nI  arrived in Selma  about  10:00 on July s.  I  was  in \nCrocker's  office when  D~luth and  Prince  arrivedo  Crocker \nasked questions  and  took dot-m  the  answers.  vJhen  I  heard \nthe name,  Jerry DeMuth,  I  looked for  an  article D~1uth had \nwritteno  He  said the  inaccuracies  tยทTere  not his,  but  that \nhis editors had changed  it for a  better story.  DeMuth  had \nnot  protested the changes.  DeMuth  had given his address \nin Atlanta as  the  SNCC  headquarters;  I  had had  the  tags \ntraced.  Dcl-1uth  said he  was  not  employed  by  SNCC  but  by \nBlack Star.  I  told DeMuth  that  other  la~Jmen sai.d Del1uth \nalways  arrived a  few hours  before  trouble.  I  said,  \"DeMuth, \nyou  are  the man  1<11ho  triggers  incidents.\"  Del!uth  promised \nnot -to  trigger any  incidentsG\" \nSomeone  from  the  Selma Del  reported that Prince  had \na  gun  in his  pocket. \nOn  the  evening  of July S,  I  was  at the  sheriff's officeo \nThere  was  a  great number  of  presons  there,  including  the \nsheriff and  the  troopers.  Sheriff Clark was  there when  the \ntrouble was  called in,  but  I  do  not know  how  long he had \nbeen  there.  Colonel Lingo  was  not  there;  he  was  eating dinner \nat the Elks  Club.  I  had known  of  the  Green Street Meeting; \nthe  situation was  \"very tense.\"  tfuen  I  heard on the radio \nthat there was  a  riot,  I  asked the  trooper to  take me  to  the \nscene.  I  asked Crocker  about  the  injuries;  He  said no  one \nneeded hospitalization.  Some  people  had been hit by  rocks, \nbut  there  were  no  serious  injuries.  I  then ran into  the  tear \ngas.  I  heard someone  say,  \"That's  the one  that was  carrying \na  gun.\"  I  turned and saw Prince  and DeMuth.  I  then heard \nsomeone  suggest  searching  the car.  I  went  over  to \nD~luth's \ncar and  said,  \"D~Iuth, you  promised me  you  tvouldn 't start \nanything.\"  DeMuth  said nothing.  I  then said,  \"Prince,  if \nyou  have  that gun,  you'd better give  it to me.\"  He  said, \nI  don't have  it.  DeNuth  asked for  protection.  I  said,  we \nhaven't hurt you.  t.:re  can't follmr you  all around  town. \nDeNuth  then  said he  wanted protection to get out  of  tmm. \nI  said,  \"You  can certainly get that.\"  I  did not  urd.er  Priru.;;e \nand  Del1uth  to get out of  town;  I  did not  advise  them  to get \nout;  I  did beg  them to get out of  town  and not  to start any \nincidents. \nC-60 \n\nI  do  not  la1ow  if there  is any  other person  in the  radio \nlogs  who  might  be  called \"solicitor.\"  I  am  commonly  called \nsolicitor myself. \nIt was  probably July  8  that  I  was  in my  office at the \nCourthouse  and  the  Grand  Jury had  recessed when  I  decided \nthat I  would  go  uptown  for  something  to  eat.  I  was  on the \ncorner  of  the Drug  Store when  I  saw a  group  of  people  coming \ndown  the  street;  they were  both white  and  colored.  I  returned \nto  the  courthouseo  \"I did not  place anybody  under  arrest.\" \nI  told an  officer that  the grand  jury was  not  in session, \nbut  that  Judge  Hare's  court was.  I  then  took a  sign from \na  piCket,  wrote  on  it the time  and  place  and  other  pertinent \ninformation.  I  left.  I  never  talked with the  arresting \nofficer.  That's all I  did.

I  told the  sheriff  I  did not  know  of  any  law that \na  baseball bat was  a  concealed weapon.  However,  I  told the \nsheriff,  \"it would  be  a  good  idea to hold them,  โขโขโข  because \nthey're up  to no  good.\"  Later,  I  told the defense  attorney \nI  had  not  had  time  to  research the question;  I  did  research \nthe question,  then  gave  instructions  to have  the  cases  nol \nprossed.

I  stayed in \nthe  car most  of  the  time  during  the meeting. \nIn the  fall  of  1963  I  made  an arrest  in front  of Carter's \nDrug  Store.  I've made  only two  arrests  as  Circuit Solicitor. \nThe  person  I  arrested was  not  carrying a  registration sign; \nhe  was  advocating  boycotting.

[At  the McLeod \ntrial, Mr. McLeod  was  asked,  concerning  the  persons  arrested \nin the  fall of  1963,  whether all they were  doing was  carry \ning registration signs,.  His  ans~1er was:]  \"No,  because  they \nwere  inciting the  public.\"  The  man  that was  arrested at \nCarter Drug  was  charged with unlawful  assembly. \nI  could not go  to  the meeting  in  the  fall of  1963  that \nJudge Hare  held concerning  the  Selma University students. \nI  told Hare  that my  main  concern was  getting  the kids  back \nin school;  I  concurred with his  proposal.  In the  summer \nof  1964,  I  came  to  the meeting  that Ot...rens  instigated,  because \nonly a  Circuit Solicitor can nol  prosse  a  case. \nrrheriff  Clark asked me  to  attend the  organization \nmeeting  of  the  posse  and to give  a  talk.  I  talked ten or \ntwelve minutes.  Later,  I  taught  a  class  on  the  law of  arrest \nand  the  law of  searches  and  seizureso  I  went  through  title \n15  of  the Alabama  Code  section,  taking  an hour and  a  half. \nI  answered more  questions  on  the  use  of  force  than anything \nelse.  I  told the men  that  there  could be  no  killing for  a \nmisdemeanor except  to  save  a  life and  that there  could  be \nno  unreasonable force. \nI  have  no  recollection of ever violating a  law and have \nnever advocated violation of  law.  [At  the McLeod  trial he \nwas  asked,  \"Do  you  remember  whether  or not  at that meeting \nyou  said,  'vle  must meet  force  with force,  the  day  of passive \nresistance has  passed'?\"  McLeod's  answer at that  was:] \nt~e \n\"I  thought  it, whether  I  said it or not.,\"  If that  book  says \nI  said that,  I  said it. \nMr.  Reese  is my  Deputy  Solicitor in the  County  Court \nfor Dallas  County.  He  has  been on  the  job for 43  years. \nTo  compensate  for Iโขir.,  Reese's  health problem,  I  handle \nReese's  case  loads  every Thursday.  I  have  never \ndiscr~inated \nagainst  any Negro;  I  hold white men  to higher  standards  than \nNegroes. \nc ... 6o-c \n\nBERNARD  REYNOLDS \n(Hhite) \nI  have  been Probate  Judge  of Dallas County  since \n1954.  I  have wide  duties  concerning  Probate,  Revenue, \nand  Juvenile matters.  My  office is on  the  first  floor \nof  the  courthouse.  I  never hold  any County Court.  The \nonly type  of Court  outside  of Probate  and  similar matters \nthat 1  hold  is Juvenile.  Judge  Hare  has  no  jurisdiction \nover  the  juvenile  court except  for  appeal.  1  am  not  a \nlawyer. \nEach  case  I  handle  gets  \"individual  attention.\" \nHost  cases have  a  case worker  assigned  to them  from \nthe  Department  of Pensions  and  Security.  In the Fall of \n1963,  demonstrators  were  handled  so  far  as  possible \nindividuallyo  I  asked Judge Hare  for  advice  on how  to \nreduce  my  case  load.  Judge  Hare  suggested referees,  and \n1  appointed  some.  1  tried to have  a  guardian,  parent,  or \ncase worker  present,  for  each child.  I  also  tried to \nkeep  in touch \"t-;ri th the  schools,  since  the  principals  of \nHudson High School were  disturbed over  bad  attendance. \nHost  children were  paroled back  to  their parents. \nI  do ~ot discriminate  agains~ any  Negro  child. \nI  spend more  time  with  the  Negroes  because  of  the \ndifference  in the  background. \nThe  County  government  has  \"bent  over backwardsu  to \ndo  everything we  could  to  control  the racial situation. \nSigns  for  colored and whites  were  moved  from  the  drinking \nfountains  in the  courthouse. \nMy  interviews with children are  not  recorded. \nInvestigation of  a  child by  the  child welfare worker  is \nnot  in writing,  and notes  are not  part  of  the  file. \nHy  instructions  to  the  police  are  to  contact me \nupon  the  arrest  of a  juvenile.  On  July 6  I  told the \npolice it was  \"perfectly all right\"  to  hold  children in \njail until  I  heard  the  case.  [To  the question whether \nit was  his  general  practice  to keep  children in  jail \nuntil hearing rather than  to release  them he  answered:] \nI  handle  cases  as  quickly  as  I  can.  I  do  not  turn a  child \nloose until my  office  can  contact  the  parents.  I  have \ngiven definite  instructions  that  juveniles  are  to  be kept \nseparately  from  adults.  Helfare workers would  report \nanything out  of  place  along  these  lines. \nThe  form  [from Pl.  Ex.  No.  21]  filled out  for  Gloria \nBostick is the  form used  in September  and October  of 1963 \nand  in July of 1964.  The  forms  were  filled out  by  a  case \nworker  or myself. \nOn  page A4  of  the records  in Plaintiffts Exhibit \nNumber  21,  there  is a  notation in my  handwriting,  \"evasive \nC-61 \n\nand  so  sent back  to  jail.\"  The  judgment for  Gloria \nBostick,  the  girl who  was  e.va.sive,  states  \"probation.\" \nGloria Bostick was  \"evasive and disrespectful.11  I \nbelieve that she was  released from  jail the day  after \njudgment.  Vashtie  Leashore was  with Gloria Bostick at \nthe  time  of  judgment.  [After being shown  records  that \nindicated Gloria Bostick was  released from  jail on orders \nof  the  Federal District Court,  Judge Reynolds  stated:] \nI  do  not remember  actually whether  she  came  to the  juvenile \ncourt the  day  after  judgment. \n[Upon  being asked whether he had  any  independent \nrecollection of  the  case  of Willie Reynolds:]  I  believe \nwe  released that boy  to his  aunt.  I  have  no  explanation \nof  the fact  that the  records  of  the U.So  District Court \nshow  that Willie James  Reynolds  was  released July 15  on \nthe  order  of that court.  The  date  of  a  judgment  of \nprobation for him is dated July 9. \nIt is not my  general practice to send  persons  on \nprobation back  to  jail, but  \"it has  been done.\" \nThe  racial situation was  tense  last fall  and  spring \nand  in July.  Since  then things  have  been  comparatively \nquiet.  During  the week  of July  5th,  \"the situation was \nvery  tense.\"  I  would not  allow my  wife  and daughters  to \nvisit friends  in North Selma.  [Upon  being  asked whether \nhe  agreed with  the  statement in the  Selma  Times  Journal \nfor  July  9  that Selma was  'well on its way  to its third \nday  of  relative racial calm.\"]  I  agree  that the  situa. .. \ntion was  better,  but  I  would  still not  let my  family  go \nout  at that time. \nI  discussed the  injunction with Judge Hare,  with \nthe  attorneys,  and with  the Board of Revenue.  The  Board \nof Revenue  authorized  the  decision in order  to  stop \nmeetings  on  the  street,  and  so on.  I  think  that  the \ninjunction is all that saved  Selma from  seriotJ.s  trouble. \nThere were  long registration lines from September \nand  October 1963.  Since  then there has  been supervision \nover  lines  in the Courthouse.  On  the  first floor  of  the \nCourthouse,  there  are windows  on  the  east side  of  the hall. \nOn  the west  side,  there  are  only doors  and walls.  The \nBoard  of Registrar's  office is adequate.  Lines  need to \nbe kept  on the west  side. \nc. . \n6l-b ",

I  go  to  Hudson  High School.  I  am  not  a \nmember  of  any  organization and haven't gone  to  any  school \non  sit-ins.  No  one  told us  to  go  down  to  the movies,  but \nI  decided  to  go  on  the Fourth because  the  bill was  signed \nthe  day before. \nI  saw  a  group  of  deputies  and white  persons  by  the bus \nstop when  I  arrived  at  the t,Tilby  Theater  at about  2:30. \nThe  deputies  had  guns  and  nightsticks  and wore  silver badges. \nThere  were  8  or 10  deputies  and  about  15 white  person.s  in \nfront  of  the  theater.  Some  police  cars were  cruising by, \nand  a  Sheriff's Department  car was  stationary at  the  bus \nstop.  The  manager of  the  theater,  Hr.  Butler,  asked  if the \nother Negroes  and  I  wanted  to  enter the  section  previously \nreserved  for whites;  this was  around  three  o'clock.ยท  I \nentered the white  section with  about  ten  other Negroes, \ntook  a  seat,  and watched  the  movie  for  about  45  minutes. \nl1r.  Butler told us  that some. whites  had  gathered outside \nand  that  for our own  sake we  should leave.  Some \n~vhites, \nabout  5  or 6,  came  into  the  theater cursing.  I  got up  to \nleave;  a  white man  stepped  in  front  of me,  and  I  tripped. \nThere  were  deputies  in  the  theater,  right behind  the whites, \nbut  the  deputies  did nothing.  vfuen  I  left,  3  or 4  deputies \nin khaki uniforms  were  still at the bus  stop.  Police  cars \nwere  still cruising by,  but  I  saw  no  Sheriff's  Department \ncars. \n-B-1 \n\nI  ,  , \n(Negrd) \nI  t>Tas  born  in Selma,  Alabama,  and  lived near here until \n~1e moved  to  Gary,  Indian.a,  in  1945.  I  am  now. living in \nCambridge,  Massachusetts,  attending Harvard,  where  I  am  in \nthe  second half of my  junior year. \nIn  the  summer  of 1964,  I  came  to  Selma  ยทwitih  . \nSilas Nonnan,  Karen  House,  Carol Lawson,  and Hary  Varella, \nto work on  a  literacy project.  I  had  done  the  same  type \nof work before,  teaching  adults  reading  and writing. \nOn  July 4,  1964,  the  literacy project staff met  at the \nmission  to  dra'l:-1  up  a  reading  and writing  program.  Then we \nwere  going  to  the  SNCC  office  to  use  a  mimeograph machine. \n\"Je  had not had lunch.  I  had heard that  two  separate groups \nof Negroes  had been  served  at  the  Thirsty Boy  Drive  In. \nA little after noon,  Lawson,  House,  Norman  and  I  drove \ninto  the Thirsty Boy  parking  lot.  ~-\\fe  got out of  the  car.  A \ngentleman  came  out and  said \"You  might  as  well go  away.  This \nis private  property.\"  The  man  went  right back inside.  He \ndrove  away  and  parked on Broad Street.  Then  all four  of us \ncrossed Broad  and went  into  the  Thirsty Boy. \nHe  took seats  at a  table  in the middle  of the  dining \narea.  There were  several  persons  present.  No  one  said \nanything  to  us.  I  noticed  a  self-service  sign  and  told \nNorman  we  had  to  order.  Norman  went  to  the  counter by  the \nbig  (service)  window.  A waitress  left and went  into  the \nback room.  Norman  stood there  several minutes.  I  did not \nhear Nr.  ยทvrarren  tell Norman  to  leave. \nThe  Sheriff and  seven  or eight deputies  came  in.  The \nSheriff ~1ent to  the  small  (tray)  window  and  said,  \"You want \nthem  all arrested,  don't you?\"  Hr.  Harren  said,  \"No,  I  just \nwant  them out  of here.\"  The  Sheriff repeated his  question. \nSomeone  then  handed some  papers  through  the  windows;  I  think \nit was  the  Sheriff who  handled  the  papers,  but  I'm not  sure. \nThen  the Sheriff came  over and  said,  \"All right,  let's \ngo.\"  The  Sheriff  touched me  with a  small  instrument  that \nproduced  a  jolting sensation.  He  did that also  to  the  others. \nWe  got up  and were  escorted to  the  car by  the Sheriff.  On \nthe way  to  the  car Norman  was  prodded.  Norman  was  taken  to \none  car and  then  taken  out  and  put  in  the  other car.  I  got \nin  the  back seat last;  I  got  a  jolt and  jumped.  Norman  was \nbeing  jolted by  the Sheriff and  seemed  to  be  in pain;  he was \ntrying  to avoid  the  jolts.  The  Sheriff said,  \"Are  you  trying \nto  kick me?t \n\nweยฅ~ ~eing \nI \nUhile  Norman  and  fingerprinted  at the \njail,  the  Sheriff asked each of us  twice  whith was  the  one \nwho  tried to  kick him.  The  Sheriff then  charged me  with \nresisting  arrest. \nI  stayed in  jail seven  days.  vJhen  I  was  and \nreleas~d \ngot my  car back,  a  camera  and  several  papers  were  missing. \nI  did not attend  any  mass  meetings  or organize  sit-ins. \nI  was  working  on  the  literacy project. \nI  was  served with the  injunction while  in  jail. \nB-2-b \n\n;:lA\\lSbp \nCA.3Qt \ntN~g~o) \nI  war:;  born  and  raised  in the  Bron:M:  and.  reside  there noW'.-- \nI  am  19  arid ;itl  rri~  junior y~ar at Howard  University  in Hashing ... \ntonโข  My  major  is English with  a  minor  in  journalism. \nxw \npurpose  in being  in  Selma  last summer  was  to  work with \nadult education;  I  lived at 804  Sylvan  Street with Karen  House. \nOur  first activity  in Selma was  a  reception at which we  met \nsome  adult leaders.  The  five  of us  [in  the Adult  Literacy \nProject;  see  p.  B-2-a]  held meetings  among  ourselves.  1tJe \nheld no  mass  meetings;  I  attended none. \nl-Je  t~ent to  the  Thirsty Boy  after using  the  mimeo  at \nSNCC;  we  made  copies  of registration  application  forms  and \nnotices  of  clinics.  T-re.  were  there  a  short '\\'lhile,  time  for \ntwo  drags  on  a  cigarette,  when  the  Sheriff  came  in.  I  saw \nhim hand papers  to  a  man,  saying,  \"Here  are  the  warrants  for \nyou  to  sign.\"  '!he  Sheriff  came  over,  and  I  felt a  cattle \nprod.  I  did not hear  the  word  \"Arrest\" until we  were  toward \nthe  door. \nThere  \\i1as  confusion  at the  car.  I  slid across  the  back \nseat on my  knees.  'diley  and Horman  were  being  prodded. \nI  bought  a  brand new  bicycle  from  Sears before  coming \nto  Selma;  it was  sent  to  meยท.  ,.vith  the bicycle,  I  bought  two \nfeet of  chain;  I  also  bought -a  combination  lock from  a  five \nan.d  ten.  I  used  the  chain  and  lock from  the  time  my  bike \narrived  in Selma until my  arrest.  I  wrapped  the  chain  around \nthe  spokes  of my  bicycle  and  around  a  nearby  post or similar \nobject  to  lock my  bike;  Karen  House  and  I  usually  locked our \nbiY~s together with my  chain.  On  July 4,  I  left my  bike  in \nour house,  locked  the  house,  and  took my  chain with me  to  lock \nKaren  House's  bicycle ..  Hers  was  at the  :Mission.  I  didn't \nlock her bike t1hen  'l:t~e  t-7ere  there,  and  it \\i1as  stolen while we \nwere  in  jail.  \\.ยทThen  I  was  arrested my  chain was  in my  purse, \nwhich was  tal(en  at the  jail.

I  did \nhear on  the  radio  that one  of  the  group  had been  charged with \ncarrying  a  concealed weapon.  I  had no  conversation '\\ilith \nSheriff Clark about  the  chain  or the  wrench  that was  with it. \nThe  t'lrench  came  with  the  bicycle when  I  bought  it. ยท  I  am  five \nfeet  six inches  and weigh 120  pounds. \nI  was  in  jail continuously  to  July 11  and was  served \nwith  the  injunction. \nI  never  taught  anyone  while  I  was  in Selma.  In  June, \nwe  made  contacts.  After our arrest,  we  felt inhibited.  vJe \nworked  on  pamphlets  to  be used  in  adult education  classes \nthroughout  the  South.

I  came  to  Selma  in Barch  1964 \nas  field  secretary for SNCC  and  stayed  in  town  almost \ncontinuously until July.  After the  arrest,  I  stayed until \nthe  Friday before  Labor Day.

The  other  project workers  were  not members \n. of SNCC.  . \nSNCC  has  worked  on  voter registration in Selma.  I  did \nnot  participate  in  any  demonstrations. \nOn  July  4,  1964,  I  went  to  the  Thirsty  Boy  because  of \nthe  1964  Civil Rights Act  and because  someone  (possibly \nAlvery vJilliams)  had  said  the  Thirsty Boy  served  Negroes. \nIn  the  parking  lot I  heard no  violent  language.

I  went \nfrom my  home  at 1309  Duke  Street to  the  theater.  I  walked \nsouth on  Broad Street to l;Joolworths'.  There  was  a  large \ngroup  there,  a  larger group  across  the  street,  mostly \nNegroes.  I  asked  some  friends  what was  going  on.  Someone \nsaid  that  some  Negroes  had  gone  into  the Wilby  Theater. \nI  asked  if my  friends  planned  to  go  in.  I  saw no  deputies \nor policemen.  I  saw  one  car,  but  I  don't know  whether it \nwas  a  police  car or a  sheriff's  car.  There  was  a  crowd  in \nfront of vroolworths',  I  clidn 't notice  any  crowd by  Carter \nDrug. \nI  went up  to  the  ticket window  with Joe  Smitherman,  a \nNegro  friend.  Smitherman  got  in,  but  I  did not.  As  soon \nas  I  started to  go  in,  a  white  civilian asked,  \"\\fuere  are \nyou going?\"  I  said I  was  going  in  the  door.  The  civilian \nsaid,  \"Hrong  entrance.\"  I  answered,  \"I bought  a  ticket  for \nthis  door.\"  The  civilian  cursed.  The  crowd began  whooping \nand  yelling.  The  crowd  was  Negro.  He was  the  only white  man \nthere  at  first.  He  blocked my  way  again..  I  stepped back. \nBy  then,  Standberry had bought  a  ticket.  Standberry  asked \nthe white  man  if he  represented  the  management.  The  white \nman  answered,  \"No.\"  t-Jilliams  said,  \"Then  you  have  no  right \nto  block  [the  entrance] โข \"  I  didn'tยท knotttยท  who  Williams was; \nI  don't know  whether he was  urging Negroes  to  enter the \ntheater. \nSeveral white men  came  then.  Someone  said one  of \nthem  had  a  knife.  I  saw  a  white man  with  a  knife.  A Negro \nthen  said he had  a  knife  and  he  pulled it out.  Some  people \npulled him back,  shouting  and  hollering.  't-Jilliams  said, \n\"Get your money.\"  I  got my  money  back.  Then  I  noticed men \nin  uniform.  I  saw  3  or 4.  I  don't know  what  color the \nuniforms  were.  A police  car pulled up.  vJilliams  went  over \nto  it.  I  could hear only  something  like \"Those  kids  need \n11 \nprotection.\"  I  then  heard  something  about  \"If you want  to \nsign  a  warrant.\"  Then  the  pt::>lice  moved  into  the  Negro  crowd. \nThey  moved  it in every direction.  They were  swinging  their \nclubs.  No  one hit me.  I  saw  them  hit Ronald  Fuller.  The \ncrowd  then  ran  away  from  Broad  [toward 't-Jashington] โข  I  don't \nthink the  police went  in  a  specific direction.  I  don't  think \nanybody  could have  been  killed.  I  think  the  police  got  there \nsoon  enough. \n:B-5 \n\nBEN  JACKSON \n(Negro) \nI'm  seventeen and  am  in the  twelfth grade  at Hudson. \nI  attempted  to  go  to  the Wilb.y  Theater  with Leon  Sanders \nand Hazel  Chapman,  a  boy.  There  were  ten Negroes  outside \nthe  theater.  They  said there were  children inside and  it \nwould  be  nice  to  protect  them.  There  were  only three  of \nus,  so we  went  after some  others.  He  got  back,  and  some \nof  the  group  went  in,  but  I  went  to.move  my  car.  \\lhen  I \ncame  bad: the  city police were  by  the  side  of  the  theater. \nPolice  cars  were  patrolling.  I  moved  my  car again,  this \ntime  from  Broad  Street  to Washington Street.  When  I  got \nback  I  met  some  of my  friends.  i~e  stood  in front  of  the \ntheater and  talked for  about  5  minutes,  then  started to \nbuy  tickets.  I  had  been  to  the  theater many  times  before, \nbut  this was  the  first  time  I  tried to  go  in the  white  side. \nNo  one  talked to me  about  it the  day  before,  but we  talked \nabout  it on  the way  downtown.  Ronald  Fuller bought  his \nticket.  Sheriff Clark was  there at  the  time.  He  was  under \nthe  wheel,  maybe,  in his  car;  the  car was  in the middle  of \nthe  street,  headed toward  Washington.  Williams  [meaning \nFuller]  tried to go  in,  but was  hit.  A  short,  stubby white \nperson hit him.  He  [Fuller]  went  back  to  get  his money. \nSheriff Clark was  in a  position to  see  this. \nA white  person pulled a  knife.  I  saw a  Negro  with a \n?nife.  Ueithe~ I  nor  any  other  person  in my  car  carr1ed  a  knife \nRonald  got  his money.  Alvery r,.Jilliams  went  to  see Sheriff \nClark.  Williams  said,  \"Did  you  see  that?\"  The  Sheriff  said, \n\"Do  you  want  to  sign a  warrant?n  t-Jilliams  said,  \"You're \nthere for  protection.\"  Sheriff Clark  said,  \"The  Federal \nGovernment  passed  the  law,  let them  enforce  it.\"  The  Sheriff \npulled off then got  out.  He  and  possemen  used  sticks on  the \nNegroes  by  the door.  They  did nothing  to  the  whites. \nI  was  not  hit.  They  just  swung  their sticks and dispersed. \nI  went  baclc  to  the  theater again to  get my  car.  The  group \nwas  still in the  theater.

I  was  at the Wilby \nTh~ater \non  July 4.  I  went  about  4  o'clock,  between 4  and  5.  I  went  : \nwith Nathaniel Harris.  My  purpose  was  to  go  into. the  theater \non  the white  side.  \\.Ve  went  back to Moss  Amusement  Park to \npick up  some  others,  then we  returned.  We  decided  to  go  to \nthe white  ticket  office. \nAs  I  approached  the  theater,  \"everything  looked  pretty \nnormal.\"  Nothing  special  was  going  on.  \"There  were  sheriff's \nand  police  cars  cruising;\"  I  saw  no  deputy  standing.  Nathaniel \nHarris,  Philip Hunter,  James  Brown,  Godfrey Jones,  Bernard \nCollins,  and  Bernard Sims,  all Negroes,  were  with me.  I \nconsider myself  a  good  friend  of Philip Hunter's.  I  didn't \nleave  the  theater with him.  I  don't  remember  if I  saw him \nlater that  night.  I  didn't  go  by the  Roxy  Theater that \nevening.  We  heard Negroes  had  been admitted.  A white  man \nwearing  a  green  khaki  shirt and brown  khaki  pants  said, \n\"Nigger,  don't  go  in there.\"  He  was  not  a  lawman.  vJe  did \nnothing,  then we  said it was  our  right  to  go  into the  theater. \nThere  were whites  between  the  ticket  window and  the door. \nThere  about  15  to  20  whites  and about  as  many  Negroes  in t\"ront \nof  the  theater.  I  bought  a  ticket  and  started to go  in to \nthe downstairs  part  of the  theater.  The  same  man  hit \nme  in the  jaw.  I  did  not  go  down.  I  did nothing  for  a  while. \nWe  said,  \"it's our  right.\"  The  whites  said,  \"You  don't  belong .. \" \nI  sat..r  policemen then,  \"slowly driving by,\"  but  I  saw  no  police \nmen  by  the  white  entrance.  A Negro  said to the white  who  hit \nme,  \"Who  do  you  think you are?\"  The  white  man  replied,  \"I'll \nshow  you  who  I  am,\"  and  pulled a  knife.  There  was  an  exchange \nof  words.  A Negro  said the knife  was  no  big  thing.  I  saw \nno  Negro  pull  a  knife.  ยท \nI  was  backing  through the  crowd.  I  saw Williams  say  to \nSheriff Clark,  who  was  in  middle  of  the  street,  \"Did  you \nt~e \nsee  that?\"  We're  paying  taxes  like everyone else.\"  The  Sheriff \nsaid,  \"Let  the damn  federal  government  take  care  of  it โขโขโขโข \n:Let  the man  hit swear  out  the warrant.\" \nSheriff Clark  jumped  out  and  swung  at a  Negro,  \"Get  the \nhell  out  of here.  You  don't  belong here,  anyway.\"  [To  the \nquestion asked  on  cross,  Sheriff Clark dispersed  the  crowd, \nright?:]  \"No.  He  dispersed the Negroes.\"  The white men \nstayed. \nI  started to  leave  and  got  almost  to  the  curb when  some \nbody  said to  go  get  my  money.  I  went  back  and got  my  money. \nThe  Negroes  scattered toward Broad Street.  The  white  man  who \nhit me  was  still there.  Other  whites  were  still there.  The \nman  who  hit me  just  stepped back. \nB-7 \n\nI  figured  I  could~'t get  through the  crowd  of whites; \nso  I  followed  behind  the  sheriff and deputies.  They  went \nto \"Jashington and  Selma.  They  threw sticks  at  the Negroes, \nthen  turned.  They  saw me.  I  tried to  run,  but Sheriff  Clarl \nanticipated.  I  thought  about  going  by  and  taking  a  lick, \nbut  decided against  the lick.  There  was  a  traffic  jam,  so \nI  escaped  it. \nth~ough \nB-7-b \n\nJOHN  HARDY \n(Negro) \nI've worked  at Craig Air Force  Base  twenty years. \nThey  say  there was  a  mass  meeting  on July S,  but  I \ndidn't go.

',Je  went  from  the  inside \nof his house  onto  the  porch.  I  heard  11plenty\"  of  commo \ntion on Green Street.  I  saw  \"nothing  but  a  bunch  of men \nin helmets.11  I  reckon  they were  possemen;  they had  sticks \nand guns.  \"I  couldn't count\"  the  number;  there were  too \nmany.  There  were  no Negroes.  No  possemen came  to  604 \nLawrence  Street before  I  left.  I  heard a  posseman knock \nat  the  house  across  the  street.  The  posseman  said,  \"Put \nthe  lights  out  and go  to  bed.\"  I  started home,  walking \nsouth.  I  heard a  rock or a  bottle hit a  car.  As  I  was \nwalking  along,  a  posseman  said,  \"Didn't I  tell you  to go \nhome?\"  I  answered,  \"That's where  I'm going.\"  The  posse \nman  said 11No,  you  aren't,  you're going  to  the  ground.\" \nThen  he  clubbed me  to the  ground.  I  can't identify  the \nmen  who  clubbed me;  they  were  not  tall.  I  was  bleeding. \nI  went  to my  wife's  house  in the  George  Washington  Carver \nHomes.  I  went  to  a  hospital and was  there  from Sunday \nuntil Tuesday.  My  doctor was .Dr.  Maddox.  No  stitches \nwere  required. \nI've been convicted of  drunk  driving and  of rilan \nslaughter.

Besides  the  Negroes  who  came  to \nthe  meeting,  men  in helmets  with  clubs  and  guns  came.  I \ndidn't  see  the  sheriff;  I  couldn't  identify the  man  in \ncharge.  I  couldn't hear what  was  going  on  inside  the \nmeeting.  I  could hear  singing,  but  I  couldn't hear the \nspeakers.  The  men  in uniform were  walking  back  and  forth. \nMy  driveway was  blocked by  a  school  bus.  There were  be \ntween  80  and 100  men  lining the  street.  I  was  on my  porch \nwith my  wife  and kids  and my  brother-in-law. \nI  saw  the  people  coming  out  of  the  church.  The  people \nwere  just  talking.  Officials weren't  talking.  They had \nno  megaphone  or anything.  Then  I  heard  a  rock  or something \nhit a  car.  \"The  cops  and  the  sheriffs  then  started to  take \nin action.''  They  started clubbing  people.  I  saw  them \nbreak Mrs.  Lamar's  windows.  I  saw  them club  a  white  photo \ngrapher.  He  was  running  toward  ''Mrs.  Cardelia' s11  [Mrs. \nCardelia Lamar]  when  the  officer's clubbed him.  I  heard \nonly one  rock before  the  line  broke.  I  didn't  see  it thrown; \nit seemed  to come  from up  the  street.

I  didn't  see  any of those  persons  after the mass \nmeeting.  I  didn't  see  any  Negroes  piling rocks. \nI  had  not  seen  the men  in helmets  before.  I  had  seen \nmen  in sheriff's uniforms. \nI  did not  see  Sheriff Clark down  there.  I  saw  at \nleast 4  Selma pclice  cars,  and  I  saw  policemen up  and  down \nthe  street.  I  am  sure  there  were  policemen there.  I  can \ntell  the  difference  between Police  and  Sheriff's Department \nmen. \nAnother unusual  noise  I  heard,  beside  the  rock,  sounded \nlike a  gun  or like tear gas. \nI've been arrested once  for  drunk  driving  once  for \ndrinking,  and  twice  for disorderly conduct.  I've had  two \ntwenty-four dollar fines,  I've  served no  time. \na. .. \n9 \n\nCABRIE.ยฃ1ARDY \n(Negro) \nI  live  at 131-C  George  Carver Homes \nT~Tashington \nwhich  is between Lawrence  and  Sylvan.

I  saw  no  Negroes  outside. \nI  went  inside,  and  ''they taken a  stick and  knocked \nout  our  porch light.\"  They broke  both  the  glass  [fixture] \nand  the  light bulb.  They  also hit my  porch  sill. \nLater,  my  husband  carne.  He  was  all  bloody.  'rle \ncalled Mr.  Anderson,  and he  came.  We  took Mr.  Hardy  to \nBerwyn.  He  was  bleeding  from  the  neck,  I  think,  and  the \ntop  of  the  head.  My  husband  and  I  are  separated;  I  once \nhad  him  arrested  for  non-support. \nI  had heard  there  was  a  mass  meeting,  but  I  didn't \nknow  since  I  wasn't  there. \nB-10 \n\nJOHNNIE  LE'ASHORE \n(Negro) \nI'm sixteen;  I've  attended St.  Jude  School  in \nMontgmnery  for  three  years  and  am  in  the  eleventh grade. \nI  live  at  712  Lawrence,  in Selma.  That's  just north of \nGreen  Street Hall. \nI  attended  the  Green Street meeting.  I've \nattended other mass  meetings  too;  there were  sheriff's \npeople  at many  of  them.  There  was  11a tJhole  lot\" of \nthem  at Green  Street  just before  the meeting was  over. \nI  was  in  and  out  of  the  Green  Street meeting,\"but \nI  heard vJillie Robertson  speak.  I  did not  hear  him \ntell  the  audience  to  demonstrate,  nor  did  I  hear  him \ntalk of  white women. \nJohn Love  told us  to  go  straight home,  not  to \narouse  the  possemen.  All  Jim  Clark wants,  he  said,  is \nan  excuse  to  set his  possemen  on  us. \nPeople  began  going home  from  the meeting  gradually. \nThere were  possemen  on  the  opposite  side  of  the \nstr~et, \n\"lined up  side by  side  from  south  to north.  I  heard  a \nbottle hit  a  car  and  a  brick hit  a  car.  Then  the  line  of \npossemen  started to  move.  I  did not hear  any  deputy  say \nanything.  I  was  standing  by  a  white  photographer.  The \nnewsman  said,  \"Let ' s  run.  1  don' t  know where  to  go .\" \nI  suggested going  in a  nearby  house  tNrs.  Lamar's], \njumped  onto  its porch,  and went  inside.  The  newsman  tried \nto  run  to  the  steps  of  the  porch,  but  did not  it \n~ake \ninside.  'VJhen  I  looked out  the  window  of  the  house,  I  saw \nthe  newsman  on  the  ground,  bleeding.  Five  of'  six posse \nmen  were  standing  around,  one  smoking  a  cigar,  another  a \ncigarette.  The  possemen were  shining  flashlights  at  the \nnewsman.  Possemen  came  on  to  Jl1rs.  Lamar's  porch  and \nthrew  a  chair  at  the  screen of  the  window.  One  of  the \npossemen  said,  \"Get  your  ass  on  the  floor. \" \nI  figured  I  shouldn't go  home  through  the  alley \nway,  so  I  went  up  to  Jeff Davis.  A posseman  told me  to \nrun.  lvben  I  got home  I  saw Ned  Johnson.  He  was  bleeding. \nOn  the  morning  of  July  6,  I  went  downtown  with my \nmother.  She  went  to  the  courthouse,  [to  register,  see P. \nB-15),  while  I  went  to  pay  some  bills.  ยทI had paid all \nbut one,  when  I  ran  out of money.  I  went  to  the  alley \nby  the  courthouse  on Alabama Avenue  to  ask  my  mother  for \nmore  money.  A posseman  stepped in front  of me.  I  told \nhim  I  wanted  to  see my  mother,  but he  wouldn't  let me  go \nto  see her  because  I  wasn't  old enough  to  vote.  Eiy \nmother  came  out  and  told me  to  go  straight home.  She \nsaid she'd bring me  the money.  I  was  walking  east on \nB-11 \n\n' \nthe  $idewalk  a.oross  the  street from  the  Federal  Building \nwhen  I  $lil-t. and heard Sheriff ยทClark.

I  saw deputies  and lawmen  go  for  the \nstudents  across  the  street.  I  was  waiting  at  the  red \nlight 't..rhen  a  man  in uniform  juked .Qte  and  said,  \"Get  the \nhell  in line.\" \nNo  one  ~ver.told me  the  charge.  No  local official \never  interviewed me โข. ยท  I  was  held 4  days  and  3  nights \nwithout being  interviewed by  officers. \nOn  Thursday,  I  went  to  Judge Reynold's  office,  where \na  lady found  out  how  to  contact my  mother.  On  Friday  I \ncame  back;  my  mother  came  with me.  Judge Reynolds  asked \nif I  had  attended mass  meetings,ยท to which  l  answered yes. \nReynolds  also  asked  if I  planned  to  attend any  more \nmass  meetings;  I  answered no. \nI  never  appeared before Judge  Reynolds  before. \nI've never  heard of Ben  Scroggins.  I  don't  remember \nbeing  scooped up  in his  arms  eight years  ago  while  I  was \ncarrying  a  bottle of whiskey. \nB-11-b \n\nCARDELlA  LAMAR \n(Negro) \nI'm fifty-one,  a  widow.  I  have  a  family.  I've  lived \nnineteen years  in  Selma.  I  work  at 720  Maybrook. \nI  ltve at 712  Green  Street which  is right next  to  the \nA.N.E.  Hall.  I  was  at home  on  July  S,  except for  the  time \nwhen  I  went  to  church.  After  I  came  home  from  church,  I  saw \npossemen.  A meeting wยทas  going  on.  I've never  attended mass \nmeetings.  After  the  meeting,  I  heard  a  rock hit a  car.  The \nwhite men  in  yellow  clothes  and  helmets  started running.  I \nsaw  a  man  in  yellow  clothes  throw  a  chair through my  window \nscreen.  It came  on  to  the  bed.  I  saw  a  photographer lying \non  the  ground.  He  tried to  pass  my  steps,  but  I  saw  himget \nhit.  The  sheriff's men  gathered  around.  I  saw  men  in yellow \nclothes  break  2  windows  at the back of my  house. \nI  saw  some  officers  in  blue  clothes  from  the  city hall \nbuilding  also.  I  did not  see  Sheriff Clark.  I  did not  recog \nnize  any of  the  officers.  The  officers broke  at the  sound  of \nthe  rock.  I  didn't hear  a  shot.  I  did not  see  anybody  piling \nup  rocks  that  afternoon. \nThe  next  day  men  from  the  sheriff's department  came  by. \nThey  said  I  did not  have  to  worry,  and  that I  should call if \nthere was  any  trouble.  Also,  they  told me  that my  grandson \nhad been  outside  and  they  had  to  break  a  window  to  get him \ninside.  That  is not why  they  broke  the window. \nB-12 \n\n'{IJILLIAH  M.  SANDERS \n(White) \nI'm a  physician at  Maxwell  Air  Force  Base.  I've \noccasionally treated emergency  cases  in St.  Margaret's \nHospital,  Montgomery's  only twenty-four hour hospital. \nI've been  in Montgomery  over  a  year.  I  remember  treat \ning Jerry  DeMuth  and  David Prince  on  the  evening  of \nJuly  5.  My  notes  and  records  show  that  DeMuth 1 s  condi \ntion was  generยทally good.  He  was  alert.  He  was  bleeding \nfrom  a  cut,  however,  so  I  treated him  first.  The  cut \nwas  two  inches  long.  An  aide  cleaned  the wound.  I  closed \nit with  7  stitches.  DeMuth  had  a  painfully swollen elbow, \nbut  it was  not  broken.  DeMuth  had  scattered bruises,  some \non his legs.  I  gave  him a  tetanus  booster.  He  was  \"covered \nwith  blood\".  He  was  wearing  a  white  shirt.  He  seemed  a \nlittle addled  about  the  whole  business. \nDavid  Prince  appeared  in a  better general  condition \noutwardly.  There  were  bruises  on his  back.  They looked  as \nif they had be.en made  by a  stick.  He  had  two  bruises  on \nhis  shoulder blades  and  two  in the  middle  of his back,  one \non his  right chest  wall.  They were  visible  bruises,  which \nwere  red  but  later would  turn black and  blue.  I  don't  re \ncall the  condition of his clothing.  I  did not  feel  it \nnecessary for  them  to  stay in the  hospital,  they didn't \nwant  to.  The  records  of treatment  are  dated  July  S,  1964, \nat 11 :30  p.m. \nB-13 \n\nNED  JOHNSON \n(Negro) \nI  live  on Lawrence  Street,  I'm out  of my  senses. \nI  went  to  the  meeting.  A man  in khaki  pants  and  a \nkhaki  shirt, with  something like  a  bucket  on his head, \nhit me.  I  was  right  in front  of  the  hall.  I  was  hit \ntwice.  I  was  knocked  unconscious.  I  was  bloody.  I \ndidn't  go  home.  I  found  my  way  to  someone's  house. \nThen  someone  took me  to  the hospital.  They  did  some \nthing  to my  head. \nI  did not  see  officers before  church.  I  don't \nknow  what  time  I  got  there.  I  couldn't understand what \nWillie  Robertson  said.  I  didn't  run.  I  didn't hear  a \nshot.  I  didn't  smell  tear gas.  I  didn't hear  rocks. \nThere  was  a  \"heap of people\"  there. \nB-14 \n\nVASHTIE  LEASHORE \n(Negro) \nI'm Johnnie Leashore's mother. \nSome  time  after I  returned  from  the  Green  Street \nmeeting  to my  home  on Lawrence  Street, my  ward,  Ned \nJohnson,  was  brought  to me  in a  taxi.  At  that  time, \npossemen were  knocking  on the  doors  and  saying,  \"Cut \nout  your goddamn  lights and  turn off the  television.\" \nHowever,  when  Bubbo  [Johnson]  came,  I  turned on my \nporch light.  A posseman told me  to  turn off the  light. \nI  told him  the  posse  had  nearly killed Johnson.  The \nposseman made  a  phone  call;  I  heard h~ say,  '~e done \ngot  one  of  'em;  what  do  we  do?\"  A sheriff's man  came, \npossibly Bates.  Johnson asked me  not  to let  the  sheriff's \nmen  take  him  anywhere,  and  I  told the  lawmen  I  would \ntake  care  of Johnson. \nOn  Monday,  July 6,  I  went  downtown  with my  son.  I \nwent  to  register,  while  he  went  to  pay  some  bills. \nWhile  I  was  waiting  in line,  I  heard my  son and  a  deputy \nhaving  an argument  over whether my  son could come  into \nthe  alley way  where  the  registration line was.  I  went \nover to where  they were  standing  and,  when  my  son  told \nme  he  needed more  money  to  pay another bill,  I  told \nh~ \nto go  straight home.  I  never got  in to  register  that \nday. \nt,Jhen  I  got home  that night,  I  found  out  they had \narrested Johnnie.  They also  got my  granddaughter,  Gloria \nBostick,  the  next  day. \nI  went  to Judge  Reynolds'  office with Gloria.  She \ntold Judge  Reynolds  she  had  picked her  picket  sign up  off \nthe  street.  He  asked,  \"Didn't  you get  the  sign  from \nAmelia  Boynton's  office?\"  No,  Gloria anst-lered,  I  didn't \nget  the  sign from  ''Mrs.  Boynton's\" office.  Judge  Reynolds \ntold her,  \"Don't  call  any Negro . 'Mrs.'  in this office.\" \nGloria once  more  referred to Mrs.  Boynton  as  \"Mrs.  Boynton\". \nJudge  Reynolds  then  stated,  \"I'm going  to put  you  in jail \none  week;  I  donโขt  like  your  attitude.\"  Gloria did  go  back \nto  jail and got  out  one  week later. \nI  couldn't  say how  many  t~es I've  been arrested for \nprohibition violations.  I  was  sentenced once  to hard \nlabor and  a  fine  for using my  son,  Johnnie,  to carry liquor. \nB-15 \n\nGEORGE  SUTTLES \n(Negro) \nI  was  born  in 1905.  I  spent  all my  life in Selma. \nI  haven't  been  able  to  work for  five  years.  I  used  to \nwork  construction. \nI  was  arrested in front  of  the  Federal  Building.  I \nhad  just turned the corner.  I  had been coming  from my \nhouse,  up Water Street  to  Lauderdale,  then  toward  the \nFederal Building.  I  was  on my  way  to  see  a  lady  about \nmy  income  tax.  I've never  been  to  a  mass  meeting.  I \ndon't know  Clark Nelson;  I  never heard of him.  I \ndon't know  why  I  was  arrested;  no  sheriffs  talked  to me \nabout  it while  I  was  in  jail;  the  policeยท.  didn't  ask \nwhat  I  was  doing  there when  they  arrested me.  I  got hit \nlightly one  time  on  the  t~ay to  jail.  I  was  in  jail one \nweek.  That  [questionnaire  Pl.  Ex.

I  went  to  the  meeting  on  July  5.  vJhen  I  came \nout  of  the hall  I  saw.possemen  lined up,  and  I  saw school \nbuses. \nI  drove  toward  Jeff Davis.  I  saw  some  possemen \nand  stopped to look.  They  forced me  into  a  stranger's \nhouse. \nI  also  went  to  a  r1.1eeting  on  the  6th.  After  the \nmeeting  I  w-as  v.raiting  for  a  ride home.  It was  very \nquiet.  Sheriff  Clark  told Hr.  Gildersleeve  that he \nthought no  bricks  were  going  to  be  thrown  that night. \nGildersleeve  said none  were  thrown,  but  the  sheriff  said \nsome  had been.  Sheriff  Clarl<:  then  said that  if we  didn't \nleave,  he would  take  us  all in. \nB-17 \n\nISABEL  DUHONT \n(Hhite) \nI'm  a  doctor  and have  practiced in  Selma  since 1944. \nI  treated Ned  Johnson  on  the  5th of July,  1964. \nI  was  called about  11:30.  The  patient was  in  the \nemergency  room,  but was  conscious.  Johnson  had  a \nlaceration on  the  left side of his  head which  required \nsix stitches.  He  had  abrasions  on  his  head.  He  was  not \nseriously hurt.  He  walked out. \nB-18 \n\nM.D.  \\-JALKER \n(Negro) \nI've  been  a  doctor  in Selma  for  fifty years.  I \ntreated Odell  Solomon  on  July 4  at  about  9  or 10  p.m. \nHe  was  somewhat  shocked,  and  there  was  some  bleeding. \nI  placed three  sutures  in a  wound  over his left eye \nand  removed  them July 7. \nB-19 \n\nODELL  SOLOMON \n(Negro) \nHy  address  is 1417  Minter Avenue,  Selma,  for  fifteen \nyears~  I'm a  carpenter. \nOn  the  night  of July 4, 1964,  I  was  out  on Broad  Street. \nI  live near Clay's  Casino.  That's  near  the  Roxy \nTheater~ \nI  was  on my  way  home  from my  daughter's.  There  was  a  group \nof  possemen dressed  in khakis,  with helmets,  sticks  and  guns, \nstanding around  a  car.  I  don1t  know  what  happened,  but  I \nheard  that  a  bottle hit a  car.  They  came  over  to where  a \nbunch  of us  was  standing and  told us  to  go  home  or get \ninside.  I  stepped into  a  doorway  and  said I  was  waiting \nfor  a  cab,  then  stepped  out.  I  had  called a  cab.  They \nhit me,  but  they didn't knock me  down.  I  went  to  Dr. \nvJalker. \nThere  were  city policemen.  [In response  to  the \nquestion on  cross-examination,  '~eren't they directing \ntraffic when  they hit  you?\":]  Yes. \nB-20 \n\nJAl-1ES  ClARK \n(White) \nI  assume  there  are  booking  sheets  for  1964  other  than \nthose  I  have  produced  [as  of  December  91.  They are  filed \nalphabetically in my  office.  Mrs.  Wayne  Jones  and Mr.  Moseley \nare  the  persons  who  can  be  checked  for  information concern \ning  the booking  sheets. \nI  am  not  sure what  radio  logs  I  brought  with me. \nMr.  Young  keeps  them.  There  are  two  central  radios  that \nmaintain  logs.  There  is one  transmitter,  with  six outlets; \nall are  on  the Alabama  state trooper network.  After the \ncalls for  a  day  are  recorded,  they are  filed.  Later,  they \nare destroyed.  I'll check to  see  if any  are missing  from \nthe  first  two  weeks  in July. \nFingerprint  cards  are filed by  classification.  IYloseley \ncan  be  checked  about  them. \nI  gave  the  government  a  copy  of the posse  list in a \nprevious  trial.  Captains  of  the  posse  are  elected;  I  don't \nknow  how  many  members  there  are. \nAs  to  the mass  meetings,  I  know  I  have  no  tape  record \nings  of  what  went  on.  I  think I  \"must\"  have  notes  of  them. \nB-21 \n\nRUFUS  HEAD \n(White) \nI  brought  the records  subpoenaeCI.  by  the government .. \nI  complied as well as  possible with  the  subpoena. \nB-22 \n\nJERRY  DeNUTH \n(White) \nI'm a  free-lance  writer for  national  magazines. \nI've done  research for  SNCC.  I  now  live  in Atlanta.  I've \nworked  pretty much  full  time  for  SNCC  since  mid-summer. \nSNCC  does  not  advocate  demonstrations  and  sit-ins to \nprovoke  violence.  They  do  advocate  picketing.  I've \nalso worked  for the  American Friends  Service  Committee, \na  Quaker  organization,  for  two  years  in Dayton,  Ohio. \nWhen  I  came  to Selma on July  5,  I  was  employed  by \nBlack  Star,  an  organization that  provides  photos  and  cap \ntions  to  such magazines  as  Time  and Life.  It's not  on  the \nHouse  Unamerican Activities  Committee  subversive  list, \nso  far  as  I  know. \nTJ.Je,  David Prince  and  I,  came  to Selma because  we \nknew  there  was  to  be  a  voter registration drive  and  be \ncause  there 't-ias  to be  some  testing.  We  knew  there might \nbe  picketing.  l'le  came  to  do  some  stories  on  these \nactivities.  I  came  not  to direct any  activities,  but  to \nobserve  and  interview. \nvJe  registered at  the Albert  Hotel,  then contacted \nthe  sheriff's  office.  vJe  't'1ent  to  the  sheriff 1 s  office \nabout  11:30.  Deputies  or officers  in brown khaki uniforms \nwere  downstairs  at  the  courthouse  around  the  office  of \nDeputy Crocker,  and  inside his  office.  There  'tvere  \"at \nleast  thirty\" uniformed officers  at  the  courthouse.  T-Je \nsaw  Deputy  Crocker,  who  asked questions  and  filled out \nforms  about  us.  Blanchard  Crocker,  Prince,  and \n~1cLeod, \nI  were  in the  room  then.  Prince  and  I  said we  were  on an \nassignment  from  the  Black Star Agency  to cover  civil  rights \nactivities.  We  had  a  general  conversation on  reporting and \nvoter  registration.  Crocker  told us  that  press  credentials \nwould  do  no  good  because  he  could  not  keep us  out  of  any \nplace.  1-icLeod  said  something 1 ike,  \"Negroes  demonstrate \nonly when  newsmen  are  present.  They v.Jant  publicity.\"  l.Je \nate  then at  the  Selma  Del.  From  there we  went  to  the  SNCC \noffice,  to  the Literacy Project,  to Nrs.  Boynton's  home, \nto the  Freedom office;  and  to  our hotel.  \\.Je  ate  supper  at \nthe  Selma  Del.  After  stopping briefly at  the hotel,  we \nwent  directly to the  Green Street Hall.  John Love  told us \nabout  the  meeting.  \\.Je  arrived early,  to  set up  the  camera \nequipment.  About  four  or five  uniformed  officers were \nstanding by a  car  in front  of the  hall.  The  meeting  began \nabout  7:40  and ended  about  9:30.  About  six persons  spoke \non  the  subjects  of voter  registration and  the use  of \nrestaurants  dovmtown  by Negroes.  One  speaker said,  we \ndon 1 t  want  wh:ite  tl7omen,  tve  have  our  own.  I  heard  nothing \nabout  raping white  women.  There  was  singing,  but  no  dis \nturbance  or disorder  in the meeting.  I  took notes,  and  Prince \nphotographed  speakers  and  the  singing.  He  moved  about  ' \nB-23 \n\nand  didn't  attempt  to  what  he  was \nhid~ \ndoing.  I  made.  no  speech  and W'as  not.identified to  the \nmeetifig..  i:.t  a.bout ,8:30  or 8:4-5 'I iodked outside  the \nmeetingยท  and  saw  a  1arge  number  of  sheriff's deputies  and \npossemen,  forty  or  fifty.  L'iost  wore  khaki  uniforms  and \nhelmetsโข  the  same  as  those  worn  by  the  officers  I  had \nearlier  at  the  courthouse.  SoQe  were  dressed in greyJ \nse~rt \nTwenty-five  or  so  Negroes  were  outside,  then,  too.  'l\"he \nofficers  were  standing  across  the  street from  the  hall. \nI  had no  conversation  th  any  of  them. \n~.ri \nPrince  and  I  left the  meeting  before most  of  the \npeople  because he wanted  to  get pictures  of  the  people \nleaving  the hall.  There  were  150  to  160  people  at  the \nmeeting,  evenly  divided between  adults  and  youths.  T,-Je  had \nbeen  the  only white  persons  inside  except  for  three  to \nfive  whites  dressed in sport  clothes.  Someone  at  the \nmeeting  said  they  were  local officials. \nAlmost  all of  the  sheriff's officers  'tvere  standing \nin a  line.  There  were  62  or  63  officers  in  the  line.  I \nheard no  orders  given  to  the  Negroes.  As  the  Negroes  left \nthe  hall,  I  heard Negroes  among  themselves.  It \nsperu~ing \nwas  fairly quiet.  I  heard no  Negroes  speak  to \n~vhites. \nI  don't  recollect seeing  any  children running  around.  I \n'tvatched Prince  take  pictures.  He  made  no  attempt  to hide. \nTJe  heard  that  the  building ~Jas being  locked,  so  we  went \nback  in for  our  equipment.  I  carried  the  fl0.odlights.  I \nheard  a  noise  behind me  and  turned.\"  I  didn't hear  any \nroclcs  thrmm.  I  saH possemen  swinging  clubs.  I  heard  a \nman  tell  a  woman  to  get her  child inside.  I  wยทas  struck \nfrom  behind  and  fell  to  my  knees.  I  felt  a  quick,  sudden \npain  at  the  top  of  my  head.  I  \"t<7as  bleedin~.  I  don 1 t  know \nwho  hit me.  I  got  up  in a  daze  and  found  Dave.  He  saw \nme  and  led me  tmยท1ard  the back  of  the  building.  Someone \nshined  a  flashlight  on  nave.  heard a  shot.  Someone \nยท~ \nsaid,  \"Don't ::nove  or you're  dead.\"  Three  possemen  came \neach  of us.  Those  who  crone  toward me  jabbed me \nto~;rard \nwith nightsticks  and  led me  toward  the  front  of  the  hall. \nThey  forced  me  to  the  ground.  I  ยทsaid I  was  bleeding.  On \nthe  'lf7ay  to  the  front  of  the hall,  I  sawยท  an  officer release \ntear gas.  He.  told another  officer  that  there tvere  kids \n\"under  there.\"  I  sa'tl7  a  policeman  smash  Prince 1 s  camera with \na  nightstick.  I  was  wearing  glasses  and  carrying floodlights . \nSomeone  hit me  on  the  side.  of  the head  and knocked off my \nglasses.  They  smashed  the  floodlights.  Someone  said that \nPrince had  a  gun.  They  searched us,  but  had no  gun. \n~ยทle \nSomeone  suggested  searching  our  car;  I  unlocked  it.  Dave. \nand  I  stood with  our hands  on  the hood.  I  was  told to  for \nget my  glasses.  Our  car was  parked  on  the  meeting  hall  side \nof  t'te  church.  Someone  picked up  the  camera  and 'lil7alked  to \nthe  street  light  and  struck  the  lens  with  a  nightstick. \nSomeone  took  the  camera  and handed it back.  I  sa\"tiT  no  one \nthere  but officers  and  ourselves.  One  officer said,  \"I \nought  to kill you.\"  Another  officer said,  \"I  ought  to  fill \nyou  full of  lead.\"  ยทNo  officer offered any  medical \nassistanc~. \nB-23-b \n\nSolicitor HcLeod  yelled at us;  he  said we  should go  to \nthe  hotel,  pack,  and  leave  town,  and  not  stop until  we \nhad  left the  state.  Dave  drove,  because  my  glasses were \ngone.  We  packed,  paid  our bill,  and  left.  I  was  wear \ning  a  suit  and  a  white  shirt.  Blood 'l:.v\"as  over my  face, \nsuit,  and  shirt.  There  was  a  police  car at  the  hotel \nand  the men  inside watched us.  \\Rlen we  left,  a  station \nwagon  follm-Jed  us  for  ten or fifteen minutes. \n~~ \nI  received medical  treatment  at  a  hospital  in \nHontgomery. \nB-23-c \n\nMINNIE  B.  ANDERSON \n(Negro) \nI 've  been  in charge  of  the  Burwell  Infirmary  since \n1926. \nJohn Hardy was  brought  by ambulance  to  the  Burwell \nInfirmary at 10:30 p.m.,  JulyS,  1964.  Hardy had  a  cut \non his head  and  back.  His  wounds  were  dressed  at  the \ninfirmary.  No  stitches were  required.  He  was  given a \ntetanus  shot.  His  skull  was  x-rayed.  He  was  in the \ninfirmary  for  2  days.  His  doctor was  E.  L.  :Haddox. \nB-24 \n\nDAVID  PRil'tCE \n(White) \nI'm  twenty-two;  I'm from  Yellow  Springs,  Ohio.  l'm \nin school  now.  I  do  some  free-lance  photography work. \nDuring  the  summer  of 1964  I  worked  for  the  Southern \nDocumentary Project;  Life,  Black Star,  andothers  cooper \nated  on  it.  We  were  to do  a  documentary  on  the  South, \nmostly  in Mississippi.  First  I  went  to Oxford,  Ohio,  to \nphotograph  the  COFO  training of  the  summer  civil  rights \nworkers.  I  was  there  about  three  days.  I  followed  that \ngroup  south.  I'm not  a  member  of  SNCC  and  don't  work  for \nSNCC.  There's  a  standing  agreement  between SNCC  and  the \nSouthern  Documentary  Project. \nI  arrived  in  Selma  with Jerry  DeMuth  between 11  and \n11:30  on  the  Sunday after July 4.  We  had  been  in Atlanta \non  the  Fourth and  received  a  report  of  some  disturbance. \nWe  went  to  the  sheriff's office  and  saw  Deputy Crocker. \nWe  were  asked  to give  information to  Crocker.  Crocker \nsaid  there  was  no  such  thing  as  a  press  card  valid  in \nDallas County.  He  said he  could  not  be  responsible  for \nour  safety and  he  advised us  to  leave  town.  As  the  conver \nsation ended,  he  told us  to  leave  town.  We  answered  that \nwe  planned  to  cover  the  registration and  other activities \nin Selma.  I  saw  officers  in grey uniforms  with  nightsticks. \nIt was  they who  told us  that  the  sheriff was  not  in,  but \nthat  a  deputy was.  The  hall  of  the  courthouse  was  filled \nwith  deputies.  Solicitor McLeod  was  in the  deputy's  office. \nThe  deputy,  McLeod,  DeMuth,  and  I  were  in the  office.  FBI \nagent  Frye  was  in the  office  at  times.  The  deputy  conducted \nthe  conversation.  McLeod  interrupted occasionally.  His \ngeneral  tone  was,  \"I  don't  like  the  northern  press;  mind \nyour  own  business.\" \nAfter  that,  we  went  to  the  Freedom House,  to  the \ndowntown  office  of SNCC,  to  the  house  of a  lady who  ran \nfor Congress,  and  to  see  John Love.  We  learned  there  was \nto be  a  Negro  meeting  at  Green  Street.  i.-Je  had  an  evening \nmeal  at  the  Selma  Del  Restaurant  where  I  saw  a  men  whom  I \nlater saw  at  the  Green Street hall  in uniform.  The  man  was \nwell-built,  weighed  about  220  lbs.,  and  was  in his  early \n40's.  A  short  order  clerk beckoned  the  man  over  and  pointed \nto us.  The  man  gave  a  cold stare,  went  to  a  stool,  sat, \nand  stared for  two  minutes  by  the  clock. \nWe  went  to  the  Green Street  hall;  I  took  a  35  milli \nmeter  camera,  Nikon F,  and  3  lenses.  Two  cars  were  parked \non  the  hall  side  of  the  street when  I  arrived ..  I  moved \nabout  ~.nd took  pictures.  I  did ยทnot  try to  disguise what \nI  was  doing.ยท  mยทtites  vTithout  unifo.rms  ':vere  in the  meeting \nhall.  A teenage  Negro  pointed  at  one  of then and  said he \nwas  head  of the Klan  in the  area.  In the  meeting  there \nB-25 \n... \n' . \n\nwas  singing  and  clapping.  The  meeting was  \"very lively\", \nbut  not  in the  sense  of  inciting violence.  There  was \nsinging,  then  speakers,  then singing,  then more  speakers, \netc.  I  don't know  Willie  Robinson.  I  don't  remember  any \ntalk about  white  women.  No  one  said he  expected violence. \nThe  meeting lasted two  and  a  half hours.  When  the meeting \nwas  over,  I  went  out  ahead  of the  crowd.  I  saw  a  line of \nuniformed deputies with  sticks  and  helmets.  There  were \nabout  sixty-three  to  sixty-five  deputies  in the  line. \nThere  were  more  grey than khru'i  uniforms.  I  saw  no  blue \nuniforms.  ~~enever I  turned my  camera  toward  the  deputies, \ntwo  deputies  shined  flashlights  into  the  lens.  I  took \npictures  of the  faces  of  the  people  coming  out  of  the  build \ning.  As  people  came  out,  they were  quiet.  Jerry and  I \nwent  inside  the  building  to  remove  our  equipment.  When  we \ncame  out  some  people  had  left;  the  situation was  about  the \nsame.  About  five  minutes  later,  I  heard  screams  behind me. \nI  turned and  saw  a  white  puff.  I  didn't hear  any  rocks \nthrown.  My  camera was  grabbed  and  smashed  against  the  wall. \nI  was  struck on  the  back  and  pushed  to  the  ground.  I  don't \nknow  how  long  I  was  on  the  ground.  I  picked up my  camera  and \nmoved  toward  the  back of  the  building.  I  was  hit  a  couple \nmore  times  by uniformed  officers.  I  turned  and  saw  Jerry \nin  front  of the  building.  He  was  standing with his hands \nover his  face,  bleeding.  Uniformed  officers  surrounded him. \nI  came  to  get  him  and dragged  him  toward  the  rear of the \nbuilding.  '.Je  became  physically separated.  I  turned  to \nget  Jerry,  and  a  flashlight  beam  hit my  eyes.  Three  posse \nmen  were  coming  toward  us.  I  heard  a  shot.  That  was  the \nonly shot  I  heard.  I  saw  the  man  from  the  Selma  Del;  he \nsaid,  \"Let me  have  him,  I  know  him.\"  He  charged,  with  a \nstick,  I  fell  and  covered my  head  and  rolled.  He  struck \nme  several  times,  but  I  was  able  to keep moving.  I  tried \nto get  my  body under  the meeting hall.  He  got  in some  pretty \nhard blows.  Tear gas  was  thrown under  the  building.  Several \nNegroes  were  dragged  out.  I  was  exposed  to  a  lot of  tear \ngas,  as  was  the  man  hitting me.  I  was  dragged  to  the  front \nof the  building  and  was  told to  sit down.  When  I  began  to \nsit down,  one  of the  officers  said,  ''No,  not  here\",  and \nkicked me.  'ยทJhen  I  began  to  sit down  again,  one  of  the  officers \nsaid,  \"No,  not  there,\" and kicked me.  I  laid dmvn  and  was \nsearched.  I  saw  Jerry sitting.  The  man  from  the  restaurant \nsaid,  \"He  has  a  gun.\"  They  searched me.  Then  the  officers \ntook  the  keys  to  the  car from  DeNuth.  l,.Te  were  put  up  by  a \npatrol  car while  DeMuth's  car was  searched.  I  didn't  see \nCrocker  there.  A man  who  was  identified as  Sheriff Clark \nby  the  deputies  came  up  and,I  think,  ordered  the  search of \nteNuth's car.  We  were  put  in the  sheriff's car.  A deputy \ntook my  camera  and  hit  the  lens with his  night  stick. \nThe  sheriff got  the  camera  and  said  ''You  can't do  that,\" \nand  handed  it to me.  About  3  minutes  later,  I  saw McLeod. \nHe  screamed at us,  \"Go  back to  your  hotel,  get  your  things, \nand  get  out  of Alabama  or you'll  be  killed and  followed.\" \nNo  one  followed  us  to  the  hotel.  We  left the  hotel.  A \ndark  station wagon  followed us.  There  were  no  uniformed \nB-25-b \n\nmen  in the  station wagon.  ,,_,e  went  to  lVlontgomery  and \nwent  to  a  hospital.  A  state  investigator  interviewed \nus  there.  After a  three-hour  interview,  we  signed \nstatements.  At  Green Street  a  man  in khakis  with  a \nhelmet  and  gas  mask  and  a  rifle told me  he  was  a  state \ninvestigator.  He  said,  \"The  Negroes  started it, didn't \nthey?\"  I  said,  \"I  don't  know.\"  I  didn't  say a  Negro \nhit me. \nThe  body  of the  camera was  slightly damaged;  it was \nreparable..  One  lens was  damaged  beyond,  repair.  The \nlights were  smashed. \n[To  the  question on cross:  11The  deputies were  trying \nto  get  you  two  out  of all  that  mess,  weren't  they?\":] \n\"I  don't  believe  so.\" \nB-25-c \n\nFRANK  LaPORTE \n(White) \nI'm a  police  captain.

I  live  ยท:now  in Jacksonville,  Florida.  I  was \nassigned  to  Selma  during  the  week  of July 6.  I  arrived \nfrom Mobile  the  afternoon of July 5  with at  least  two \nothers.  He  were  assigned because  of prior disturbances \nand  the  coming  registration drive. \nI  took  all  the  photographs  from  July 6  [in plaintiff's \nexhibit 14].  The  first  picture  appears  by  the  shadows  to \nhave  been  taken around  noon.  Approximately  twenty-five \ncl:J.poed.  during  that  serieG  of  pictures.  I  photographed \nthe  picket  signs  later.  The  pickets were  in front  of  the \ncourthouse  one  or two  minutes  before  they were  arrested. \nThe  man  with  the  mike  in his hand  in the  third picture  is \nJames  Clark.  The  man  in the white  shirt  is  Blanchard McLeod. \nSheriff Clark made  two  announcements  over  the  loudspeaker \n\"Stay lvhere  you are;  you're  all  under  arrest,\" and  \"They're \nrunning  around  the  corner.\" \nThe  last four  [pictures]  on July 7  are  mine.  I  took \nthe  first  picture with  a  telephoto  lens  from  the  third floor \nof  the  Federal  Building.  It portrays  several  possemen  and \npossibly one  deputy  in the  alley.  The  second  picture  shows \nthe  other side  of  the  alley;  one  deputy and  tlvo  possemen  are \nthere.  The  third picture  is of the  alley door.  The  fourth \nis  of  the  door  to the  office  of  the  board  of  registrars. \nThe  last  three  pages  of pictures on July 8  are  mine. \nThe  first  picture was  taken at  12:58  pGm.  The  series  goes \nto  about  1:15 p.m. \nI  took  all  the  pictures on  July 9.  They  run  chrono \nlogically.  The  first lvas  taken at 1:30  p.m.  'Ihe  Negroes \nhad  stood there  two  or three minutes  before  they were \narrested.  Approximately  ten minutes  elapsed  in the  series. \nHcLeod  is in none  of  the  pictures.  Sheriff Clark  is in \nthe  second,  third,  and  fourth  pictures. \nThe  pictures  at  night were  taken on  Broad  Street  at \nthe  Tabernacle  Baptist  Church.  They  show  sheriff's posse \nmen  and  deputies. \nI  took  all  the  pictures on  July 10.  They  show  posse \nmen  around  the  Dallas  County Courthouse  shortly after \nlunch.  The  first was  taken  from Alabama  and Church.  All \nwere  taken within a  block of  the  courthouse. \nB-27 \n\nJOSEPH  CONNELLY \n(White) \nI'm a  special  agent  with the  Nobile  Division of \nthe  FBI.  I  was  in Selma  on  official business  from \nJuly 6  to July 10.  SNCC  did not  order me  up  here;  my \nsuperiors  did. \nI  took  some  of the  pictures  [in plaintiff's exhibit \n14].  The  first  sequence  of pictures,  taken  on July  7, \nconsisting of eight  pictures,  took  about  three  or  four \nminutes.  I  had  been  standing across  the  street  and  saw \nfour  children with posters. \nI  took  the  first  fourteen  pictures  on  July 8.  I \nwas  standing  in approximately the  same  place  as  the  day \nbefore.  The  first  two  pictures,  taken before  noon, \nshowยท  ABC  television men.  At  one  time,  almost  the  whole \nfront  steps  of  the  federal  building  t-lere  occupied with \nnewsmen.  The  next  series  of  pictures,  which  required \nabout  three  or  four  minutes  to  take,  was  tru~en during \nthe  noon hour  and  shov1s  persons  being put  in a  car.  The \nnext  series,  of three  photographs,  was  taken  about  1  p.m., \nwithin a  half hour of  the  last  series.  It depicts  a  man \nwith a  placard on the  steps.  The  last  four  pictures \ntaken on  July  8  were  taken within  fifteen minutes  of  the \nprior series;  they took  four  minutes.  They  show  a  youngster \non  the Lauderdale  Street  side  of  the  courthouse. \nOn  the  morning  of  July 8,  I  took  three  pictures \nlooking  into  the  alley way  on  the Alabama  Avenue  side  of \nthe  Dallas  County Courthouse. \nB-28 \n\nLEONARD  CROCKER \nOfuite) \nI  am  Sheriff  Clark's  Chief  Deputy. \nI  signed all  those  affidavits  [in Pl.  Ex.  No.  15]. \nEach  charges  the  arrested person with contributing  to  the \ndelinquen~ of Claude  Nelson.  The  only record  I  have \nconcerning  the  illegal activities  of  the  persons  arrested \nis  this  [Pl.  Ex.  No.  15].  I  don't remember  what  Eddie Allen \ndid with Claude  Nelson.  I  don't remember  seeing  any  person \nwith Claude  Nelson.  I  have  no  information about  that now. \nv~ didn't have  to have  any  information,  since  the  arrests \nwere  made  on sight.  Our  policy is that each man  is quali \nfied  to  make  an  arrest  if he  sees  the  offense  committed. \nI  made  the  decision  to  arrest  these  persons  for  contribu \nting  to  the  delinquency  of a  minor.  I  made  this  decision \non  the  bas:is  of  the  fact,  that  they  had  juveniles  in their \nch~ge.  I  know  that there was  a  batch of  singers;  and \nClaude  Nelson was  in the  group.  Automobiles  brought  little \nNegroes  with signs.  Some  of  the  people  named  in the \ncontributing charges  drove  pickets;  I  don't know  which \nones;  I  ha~e no  records  with me;  I'll look for  them.  Con \ntributing  charges  have been used  since  the  fall of  1963 \nwhen  so  many  children missed  school-ยทfor  picketing.  Bail \nwas  fixed  immediately for  all persons  in the  mass  arrest. \nTo  be  arrested for  interfering with the  Court,  more  is \nnecessary  than  just lY'alking  to pay  a  bill.  .\"You  could \nvery well  tell\" if the  persons  were  just passing.  Hilliam \nHoods  must  have  been interfering with the  Court  \"if he \nwas  arrestred,  he  was.\"  \"Exactly what  he was  doing,  I  don't \nknow\";  he 11o1as  present.  Hy  method  of  determining who  was \ninterfering with  the  Court was  not  to  see  if the  person \nwas  a  Negro.  Besides  presence  in the  area,  picketing, \nclapping,  singing,  and  chanting would  qualify  persons  for \narrest. \nThe  sheriff's department  handles  the  numbers  system \nfor  regist:ration.  A person comes  and  gets  a  number.  He \ncan  leave without  losing  his  place,  so  long  as  he  returns \nby  the  timโขe  his  number  is called.  The  system was  set up  a \nfew  days  a:Eter  October  7,  1963,  when  there  was  a  line of \n300  or morโขa  persons  waiting  to  register.  Before  the  number \nsystem,  a  ]Person who  left the  line went  to  the  end  of  the \nline.  He  put  the  line by  the  side entrance; JJthere  is more \nrooms  t.herโขa;  restrooms  are  available;  it1s  just more  con \nvenient.  The  lines were  predominatly  Negro  only when  they \nhad  a  registration drive.  A maximum  of  60  numbers  was \nhanded  out  each day  under  the  system.  The  maximum was  set \nafter  the Board  of Registrars  said that  there  had never  been \nanything  l:tke  the  line of  300  that  appeared  on  October  7.  - \nThe  number,  60,  was  based on  the  largest number  ever regis \ntered. \nB-29 \n\nGEORGE  STOVES \n(Uhite) \n1  am  the assistant chief deputy  sheriff.

Then  I  left and went  up \ntown  for an  ironing board  cover.  After  I  bought  the cover, \nI  started for  the place my  husband works.  He  works  at \nthe Bailey MOtor  Company  on  the corner of Church  and \nt-Jater.  I  wanted  to  get him  to  drive me  home  or let me \nhave  the car.  The way  I  always  do.  I  was  goin.g \\i1est  on \nAlabama  toward  Church Avenue.  I  l'Tas  crossing  Lauderdale \nwhen  I  saw  and  heard some  children singing on  the steps. \nI  l<.ept  on walking  on Alabama Avenue.  hfhen  I  saยทw- the \nofficers coming  across  the  street toward  the  federal \nbuilding,  I  turned and  ran back  toward  Lauderdale.  One \nof  the  police told me  to  \"hold  it\".  I  stopped and was \nput  in  line.  I  wasn't  singingยท  I  wasn't  part of  the \ngroup.  I  have circled myself  tin  the first  picture on \nthe  second page  of plaintiff's exhibit  14].  As  I  was \ngoing  up  the steps  to  the  jail,  someone  in khaki clothes, \nwith a  gun  and  a  stick,  juked me  in the rectum.  I  still \nsuffer crawling  sensations  as a  result.

The  deputy had  offered me  a  cup \nof coffee.  I  don't know  if Sheriff knew  me,  but  the \nmarshalls did.  No,  I  didn't get  the coffee. \nI  represented the  children in jail.

Its purpose \nhas  been to help  people  learn how  to  register. \nI  was  served with the  injunction on  July 10,  1964.  [For \nMrs.  Boynton's  description of the  activities  of the  respond \nents  to  the  injunction  see Appendix  B.] \nMeetings  were  held every week  from May  14,  1963  to \nJuly 1,  1964.  I  attended most  of  the meetings.  Attendance \naveraged  350,  and  200  was  the  smallest  crowd.  Sheriff's men \nwere  there  at various  times;  they  reported meetings  by walkie \ntalkie,  used tape  recorders,  and  took  notes  at  all but  three \nor four  meetings.  The  speakers  at  the meetings  did not  advo \ncate violence  or disregard for  law and  order.  I  have  spoken \nat the meetings. \nI  did  not  attend the July  S,  1964 meeting  but was  at \nthe July 6  meeting  at Shiloh.  No  meetings  were held  on July 7, \n8,  or  9.  There  was  no  meeting  on  July 4  that  I  know  of. \nAfter the injunction,  churches  continued to hold services, \nbut  they  could have  been  closed. \nI  have  been  registered for  twenty years.  I  encouraged \nNegro  voter  registration.  I  went  to  the  courthouse  as  often \nas  possible to vouch  for  the  people  I  knew.  voucher \n~he \nrequirement  was  frequently  changed. \nConsiderable activity,  including picketing,  began in \nOctober of 1963.  In that month  several  some  of \npic~ts, \nwhom  were  teenagers,  were  arrested.  This  picketing program \nwas  sponsored by SNCC,  not  the Dallas  County Voters League. \nI  did,  however,  let picketers  leave their placards  in my  office. \nB-36 \n\nENOCH  FEARS \n(Negro) \nI'm an  airman  first  class;  I've been  in the Air Force \nthirteen years,  three  at Craig.

There  are  about  a  hundred  Negro  airmen  at \nCraig.  The  purpose  of  the meeting was  to  acquaint  Negro \nairmen with the  area,  consolidate  grievances,  and keep \nyounger  airmen  out  of  trouble.  I'm  not  a  member  of  the \nElks  Club.  All  those  who  attended \"tvere  airmen except \nRev.  Smeltzer,  a  minister  from  Illinois.  I  knew him;  he's \nbeen  in Selma  previously.  At  the meeting we  discussed  the \nCivil Rights Act  and  other \nsubjects~ \nSome  time  after the meeting,  I  went  to  the  sheriff's \noffice,  where  I  talked to Chief  Deputy Stoves.  I  was  asked \nwho  gave  permission  for  the  who  attended and how  many \nmeeting~ \npeople were  there.  They  asked me  to  sign a  statement.  They \nasked me  to  identify a  picture of Rev.  Smeltzer.  I  refused \nthe  requests,  saying  I  wanted  to  talk to  a  lawyer  first. \nI  did give  a  statement  to Major  Richardson. \nB-37 \n\nLEO  TASWELL \n(Negro) \nI'm a  staff sergeant  in the Air Force;  I've been  in \nten years  and  ten months.  I've been at Craig  one  year \nand  two  months. \nI  attended the meeting with Airman Fears  on July 23. \nOn  July 26,  I  attempted to get  breakfast  in Selma.  After \ngoing  to  church,  I  saw Airman Scott  and  suggested breakfast. \nWe  first went  to Carter Drug,  where  I  sat next  to a  white \nairman.  The  proprietor  said he  was  sorry,  but he  couldn't \nserve us.  We  left.  I  am  sure  the man  who  asked us  to  leave \nis  the proprietor,  as  I  have  seen him  there  several  times. \nHowever,  I  don't know  Dr.  Harmon  Carter by  name.  We  then \ntried another drugs_tore,  Browns,  I  think,  but  there was  no \ncounter.  Then we  tried to  go  to  the Glass  House.  As  I \napproached  the door,  a  lady said,  \"Don't  come  in here.\" \nI  did not  see Sheriff Clark,  Blanchard McLeod,  or \nJudge  Hare  that  day.  I  was  not  arrested,  but  instead \nreturned to Craig. \nB-38 \n\nErMARD  MULLEN \n(White) \nI  have  been Chief  of  Police  in Selma  for  nineteen \nyears.  We  have  forty-one  men  on  the  payroll.  Our  active \nstrength  is  about  thirty.  Our  duty  is  to maintain law \nand  order within  Selma's  police  jurisdiction,  which  ex \ntends  three miles  outside  the  city.  ~-le  maintain a  radio \nnetwork  and  a  log.  The  log doesn't  state  the  subject  of \na  call unless  it's important.  Our  general  practice  is  to \ncall  through  the  base,  rather than directly car-to-car. \nOur  relations with  the  Sheriff's Office  have  been \nvery  cooperative.  Prior to July 4,  I  had  an understanding \nwith  Sheriff Clark that  the  \"Sheriff's department  would \nhandle  the  racial  matters.\" \nI've observed  racial  matters  in Selma  in the  last \nseveral  years.  Not  all  racial matters  come  to my  attention. \nI've  delegated most  of my  work.  I  don't  wear  a  uniform. \nMost  of our men  wear  a  blue  uniform. \nI  didn't  go  to  the  Uilby.  I  had  a  car parked  about \n200  feet  from  the  theater.  The  general  racial  situation \nwas  \"fairly tense.\"  We'd had  reports  of out-of-towners., \nThe  Department  had  dispersed  several  groups  around  the \n1-Tilby  on July 4.  vle  dispersed all  groups,  white  or colored. \nOn  July 5,  I  was  parked  500-600  feet  south of  the  en. .. \ntrance  to  the  Green Street Hall.  I  got  there  about  7:30p.m. \nLt.  Pyron was  with me.  I  had been  in the  vicinity of  other \nmass  meetings.  My  practice was  to  go  in an unmarked  car \nand  park  block away.  We  tried to have  a  trouble \none~half \ncar a  block behind  the  meeting  and  another on  the  block on \nthe  other side.  At  Green Street,  I  didn't  leave  the  car \nthat  evening.  I  couldn't  see  too well.  I  heard  something \nhit metal.  I  heard  someone  say,  \"They've  hit me  with a \nbrick.\"  Some  of the  deputies moved.  Tear  gas  hit me  pretty \nbad  and  I  had  to  ask  the Lieutenant  to  drive  me  away.  t-1e \nwent  back south,  then to  Franklin Street,  then  to  the  corner \nof Jeff Davis  and  Green Street.  I  couldn't  see  anything \nexcept  a  bunch  of cars  from  the  corner of  Jeff Davis  and \nGreen  Streets.  I  could  see  twenty  to  twenty-five deputies. \nI  stayed  in the  car for  ten to  fifteen minutes  and when \nthings  calmed  down  I  went  back  to headquarters. \nAfter July 3,  I  learned of  roCking  of cars.  Several \nwere  rocked  at Broad  and Small.  There's  a  traffic light \nthere.  Several  were  rocked on Lapsley between First Avenue \nand  the  tracks.  A  Police  Department  car was  rocked.  Sgt. \nGoodwin  was  in it;  I'm not  sure whether  Ellison was  in the \ncar.  Both  the  Lapsley area and  the Green Street area are \nNegro. \nB-39 \n\nROBERT  D.  CURTIS \n(Hhite) \nI  am  a  colonel in the Air Force.  I've been deputy \nwing  commander  at Craig since October  of  1963. \nOn  July 27  or 28,  1964,  there was  a  meeting of  Judge \nHare,  Sheriff  Clark,  i1r.  l1cLeod,  Col.  Ault  (wing commander), \nf.:Iajor  rtichardson  (security officer),  and  Bajor Ely  (in charge \nof  plans),  and myself.  The  meeting was  called by  the  county \nofficials;  I  think Sheriff Clark called it. \nAt  the meeting  the  county officials,  with  Judge  Hare \ntaking the  lead,  stated that  the  July  23,  1964 meeting of \nNegro  airmen at  the  Elks  Club violated  Judge  Hare's  injunc \ntion and  that  the  airmen were  subject to  arrest.  Judge \nHare  stated that Craig  airmen  \"could\" be  subject  to  the \ninjunction.  The  officials  said the airmen's  meeting dealt \nwith  the  loeal racial situation.  They  said the  Elks  Club \nwas  no  longer a  private place-,  --since  the meeting was  among \nnon-members  and  probably non-guests. \nI  don't  recall being informed  the  county had  tried to  -\nget  information from  the  airmen and  that every airman  inter \nviewed  refused  to  talk;  that  the only evidence  against  them \nwas  their taking  the Fifth Amendment.  My  impression was \nthat you  [Judge  Hare[  had  some  idea  of what  went  on  at  the \nmeeting. \nThe  officials  said they had  no  interest concerning our \ndomestic  affairs.  They  left us  free  to  investigate,  but  I \ndon't  recall any  assurances  of  non-intereference.  You  [speak \ning to  Judge  Hare]  noted  thltt ยท  our men  were  subject  to  F\"  โข โขโข ~ ~ โข \nโข!) \nsubpoena  or arrest. \nI  recall something being discussed about  the county \nstaying our of  the  Hathan Bedford Forest  Homes.  The  project \nare not  on  the base,  but  Colonel Ault  has  been  given control \nover  its occupancy.  It's desegregated now  and was  at the \ntime  of  the meeting. \nB-40 \n\nIZETTA  }iAULL \n(Negro) \nI  work  for Mr.  Kimbrough  in an office  in the  building \nin which  the  Elks  Club  is located.  I  heard  people  come \nupstairs,  looked  through  the  window  in the  door  and  saw \nseveral  uniformed  deputies.  Then  I  heard  sounds  as  if \nsomeone  were  knocking  out  a  door.  I  saw  no  one  in the \nhall  except  uniformeq  deputies. \nB-41 \n\nJAHES  C.  I<DiBROUGH \n(Negro) \nI'm a  letter carrier and  real estate broker.  On \nJuly 27,  196!โข,  I  finished carzyi1gยท  mail  and  went  to my \noffice at about  3:00 p.m.  It is  on  the  second floor \nof  the  building in which  the  Elks  Club  is  located.  On \nthe  second floor,  there  are  three  doors:  at the head \nof  the stc~rs is  one  leading upstairs  to  the  large rooms \nof  the  Elks  Club;  one  to  the  left leads  to my  office, \nand  one  to  the right  leads  to  the Elks'  \"Club  1170.\"  The \ndoor  to Club 1170 is usually closed,  but  that afternoon \nit was  open.  I  looked  to see  why  the  door  was  open  and \nsaw  some  deputies  standing  inside.  I  asked  if I  could  -\nhelp.  I  am  secretary of  the  Elks  Club,  and gave  permis \nsion  to use  the  phone.  Then Sheriff Clark;  the  steward, \nChestnut,  and  another officer came  with h~.  I  accompanied \nthem upstairs.  Chestnut  got  the ABC  license for  them and \nthey  left.  The  sheriff did not  state the grounds  for \nrevocation;  he  did not  say any  law was  violated.  The \nreason given was  \"orders  from higher authority.\"  The \nlicense was  returned about  a  week  later.  I  don't know  who \ngave  it to us. \nThe  lock to  the  Club 1170 door was  jammed  and  the \nElks  Club bad to replace  it. \nB-42 \n\nJ. L.  CHESTNUT,  SR. \n(Negro) \nI'm fifty-five  and  live  in Selma. \nI  am  the  bartender of  the  Elks  Club;  I've worked \nthere  three  years.  Only  the Exalted Ruler  and  I  have \nkeys  to  the Club,  and  the  doors  to  the  Club  and  the  1170 \nClub  are  kept  locked.  A  sign over  the  1170 Club  door  says \n\"Exclusive  1170\";  a  sign above  the  main  entrance  to  the \nElks  Club  says  '~tlembers Only.\"  ~~Je  sell liquor there. \nOne  afternoon  in July,  I  heard  that  the  sheriff was \nlooking  for me.  My  son who  is  a  lawyer  and  I  ran  into \nSheriff Clark on  the  corner of  Dallas  and  Broad,  and  I \nasked  the  sheriff  if he  wanted me;  the  sheriff said to \ncome  to  the  sheriff's  office.  My  son and  I  went  there \nand met  with Sheriff Clark,  Mr.  McLeod,  and  several  other \nofficers.  The  Sheriff  asked  about  the  \"meeting\".  I \nthought  he  meant  Elks meetings,  but he  said he  meant  the \nmeeting  of  airmen.  I  said  there  was  one.  I  told him  I \ndidn't know  what  the meeting was  about.  The  sheriff asked \nhow  they got  to have  the  meeting.  I  said  the  airmen had \nasked me,  and  I  asked  Nr.  Moss.  He  said  it was  all  right \nas  long  as  the  meeting  was  private.  l1cLeod  asked  if \nI  didn't know  that  the  white  man  at  the  meeting was  not \nan  airman;  I  said I  didn't know  - many  airmen were  in \ncivilian clothes.  They  took  a  statement  from me,  but  I \nnever  received  a  copy. \nThe  meeting had  be1en  orderly;  I  couldn't  see  or \nhear  it going  on. \nFrom  the  sheriff's office we  went  to  the  Elks  Club. \nSheriff Clark  asked  for  the  liquor license.  I  gave  him \nthe  federal  stamp  first,  but  he  said he  wanted  the  state \nlicense.  I  asked  if the Elks Club had  to  close.  He  said \nwe  could  stay open,  but  couldn't  serve  liquor.  Sheriff \nClark never complained  about  the  conduct  of  the  Elks  Club. \nHe  gave  no  reasons  for  the  taking  of the  license except \n\"orders  of higher authority\". \nThat  evening  some  deputies  came  back and  changed my \nstatement;  they  said  they had  left out  part  the  first time. \nTaking away  a  beer and  liquor license  seriously inter \nferes  with the  operation of an Elks Club,  all  right.  Our \nclub closed when  the  license was  taken. \nB-43 \n\nEI:UIN  L.  MOSS \n(Negro) \nI've lived  in Selma  all my  life,  forty  years.  I  am \npersonnel  director at  the  Father of St.  Edmunds;  I've \nworked  there  for  nineteen years.  I'm the Grand  District \nDeputy of  the  Elks. \nHhen  I  returned  to  Selma  from  a  trip on July 30,  1964, \nI  requested  a  meeting with Judge  Hare  to  find  out  how  our \nliquor license had  been violated.  He  granted  the  meeting \non August  3,  1964. \n..  At  the  meeting  I  was  asked  whether  I  knew  that  a \ncivil  rights meeting violated the  injunction;  I  said yes. \n[\nI  was  asked  if I  had  granted  the  request  for  a  meeting; \nI  said yes.  I  didn't  know  the  purpose  of  the  meeting; \nthe  club  frequently  allows  private meetings.  The  Club  is \na  private  club.  I  stated I  might  have  exceeded my  authority \nin allowing  the meeting.  The  officials at  the meeting with \nJudge  Hare  had  a  copy  of  our constitution.  It was  suggested \nthat  the Club  should  expel  the member  who  had  refused  to \n) talk,  but  I  said  I  couldn't  allow expulsion in the  absence \nof a  violation of the  Elks  Constitution. \nI  was  asked,  at my  meeting with Judge  Hare  and  others \nif I  knew  that  at  Green  Street  the  statement  was  made  that \nNegroes  should  go  out  and  rape  white  women.  I  was  also \nasked  about  statements  I  had made.  I  can't  remember  which \nstatements.  There  was  no  suggestion of  impropriety.  I \nnever urged  violence.  I  had  been  served with  the  injunc \ntion July 10. \nThe  license was  returned  to me. \nI  attended several  mass  meetings,  including one  in \nthe  spring of 1963  when James  Foreman  spoke.  I  wouldn't \nsay  the  speakers urged hitting  the  streets.  Most  of  the \nspeeches  were  on voter  registration. \nI  am  a  member  of the  Dallas  County  Improvement  Asso \nciation,  which  is composed  of ministers  and  most  business \nmen  from  the  community.  The  association tried to work \nthings  out  before  the  demonstrations.  It hasn't  operated \nmuch  since we  got  into  \"this business.\" \nB-44 \n\nGEORGE  HUDSON \n(Negro) \nI'm married;  I  've  lived  in Selma  seventeen years \nand  have  worked  a  year  and  five  months  at  the Cleveland \nTable  Company,  where  I  sand  tables. \nI  met  my  brother,  Peter,  at Eddie's  Cafe  about  mid \nday  on  July 7.  I  was  on  vacation from work.  He  went \nfrom  there  to  the  sidewalk by Miller's Funeral  Home,  a \ncommon  gathering  place  for  Negroes  in Selma.  I  don't \nknow where  the  SNCC  office  is.  I  haven't  heard of  CORE. \nMy  brother  told me  there  was  going  to be  some  picketing \nby  the  county courthouse,  so we  went  up  to watch.  About \na  half block toward  the  courthouse  we  met  a  third man, \nWalter Reeves,  who  went  to  the  courthou.se  with us.  I \ndidn't know  him.  We  didn't  talk much.  There  were  no \nchildren with us.  We  walked west  on Alabama Avenue  and \nstopped on  the  corner  across  the  street  from  the  court \nhouse.  I  was  \"right under  the  Standard Oil  sign\"  [see \nthird picture  on  second  page  of  pictures  for July 7  in \nPl.  Ex.  No.  14].  Two  boys  and  t'tvo  girls were  picketing \nin front  of  the  post  office building.  vJe  stood  there  and \nwatched.  After  the  pickets were  picked up,  we  turned \nback.  We  got  to the  corner of Broad  and Alabama,  where \nSheriff Crocker arrested us.  We  stayed  in  jail  a  week; \nno  one  from  the  sheriff's office  asked  us  what  we  had \nbeen doing.  Crocker didn't  tell us  what  we  were  arrested \nfor;  I  know we  were  arresยทted  for  interfering with  the  court. \nI  don't know  Claude  Nelson. \nI  had  a  switchblade knife  with me  that  day,  \"but  it \nwasn't  no  good,\"  and  the  blade  had  been broken. \nB-45 \n\nFLORENE  GOODHIH \n(Negro) \nI'm  thirty .. two;  I've always  lived in Selma.  I'm \nmarried,  but  separated;  I  have  one  child. \nI  attended  the  Green  Street meeting.  I  heard a \nspeaker sayt  If you go  to  a  restaurant  and  they  refuse  you, \njust turn  away.  Most  of  the  talk was  about voter regis-\ntration. \nOne  day  the  next week  I  went  to  register;  I  first \ntried to  get  into  the  registration  line  through  the  alley \nway  on  Church Street between Alabama  and  Selma Avenues. \nThere  were  two  possemen  at  the head  of  that  alley,  however, \nso  I  went  around  the block to  the  alley on  Lauderdale \nAvenue.  There  were  two  possemen  there,  also;  one  of  them \nturned me  away,  saying  I  couldn't get  through  there.  I \nnever  tried to  get  to  the  line from  in front  of the  court \nhouse.  There  were  quite  a  few  possemen  in front of the \ncourthouse,  and  only  a  few  on  the  sides.  No  one  told me \nthat  I  couldn't go  to  the  front  of  the  courthouse,  and  no \none  told me  that  I  could. \nโข \nB-46 \n\nGEORGIA  HENLEY \n(Negro) \nI  am  a  clerk-typist  at  the  Father  of St.  Edmunds. \nI've worked  there  nine  years,  I'm twenty-five. \nI  arrived at  the  courthouse  on  \\โข!ednesday,  during \nthe  l-leek  of  July 5  at  about  9:15  a.m.  I  got  number  10 \nand  stayed  at  the  courthouse  in the  line in the  back \nalley.  I  got  in to  apply  to  register about  two.  This \nwas  my  5th attempt  to  register. \nB~47 \n\nLORETTA  RILEY \n(Negro) \nI'm twenty-six;  I  live  in Selma. \nI  was  standing at  the  corner of Franklin and  Alabama \nwhen  I  heard  a  car with  a  siren and  followed  it to  see \nwhat  had happened.  I  knew  t J:ere  was  a  tense  situation  in \nSelma;  that  was  the  reason  I  followed  the  car.  I  was \nstanding by  the  flag  post when  the  singing  started;  soon \nafter that,  the  lawmen  came,  and  I  was  arrested.  No \nofficial  asked why  I  had  been arrested.  I  don1t  know \nClaude  Nelson. \nB-48 \n\nFREDERICK  REESE \n(Negro) \nI  was  born  in Selma.  I  teach  at Hudson  High  and  am \na  minister.  I  preach  at Macedonia  and Nt.  Zion Churches. \nI've been  an  officer of  the  Dallas  County Voters \nLeague  for  about  a  year.  I  have  attended  and  spoken  at \nmass  meetings.  I  have  never  encouraged violence  against \nduly  elected  law  officials  of  Dallas  County  and  have  never \nencouraged  disregard  for  law  and  order.  I  have  heard no \nother  speaker  at  any mass  meeting  encourage  violence  againstยท \nlaw  officials  or  disregard  for  law  and  order. \nI  was  arrested July  7  after giving  a  lift to  three \nteenagers who  had  asked  for  a  ride.  I  was  going  home,  but \nwas  glad  to  them.  I  assumed  they were  going  to  picket, \nh~lp \nas  they held  signs.  I  don't know  whether  one  of  the  boys' \nnames  t-1as  Samuel l1e,v;ell\"  I  stayed  in jail a  part  of  four \n.days.  ยท \nI  was  served with  the State Court  injunction on  July \n10. \nB-49 \n\nSILAS  NORMAN \n(Negro) \nI'm from Augusta,  Georgia.  I  went  to  high  school \nthere  and  to Payne  University there.  I  studied natural \nscience.  I  studied medical  microbiology at Atlanta \nUniversity for  a  year and  attended  the  University of \nWisconsin  for  a  year.  Since  the  latter part  of August, \nI've  been  a  staff member  for  SNCC.  The  outfit  I'm \nwearing  is similar to  one  many  members  of SNCC  wear. \nBefore August  1964,  I  was  not  associated with  SNCC. \nI  came  to Selma  in June,  to work with lames t,Jiley,  Karen \nHouse,  and  the  others. \nI  was  arrested by  Sheriff Clark  and  other men  from \nhis  department  at  the  Thirsty Boy  on  July 4,  1964,  and \nreleased  on July 11.  I  was  prodded  in the  left arm with \na  short  cattle  prod.  The  shock  was  quite  \"surprising\". \nI  was  prodded  on  the  way  out  of  the  Thirsty Boy,  into  a \ncar,  out  of  it, and  into  another  car.  Clark asked me  if \nI  had  tried to  kick him/~ยท ;  and  I  said no. \nThe  owner  of the  Thirsty Boy  did not  know my  name. \nNo  one  asked my  name  before  I  got  to  jail. \nI  attended  some  mass  meetings,  but  never spoke  at \nthem. \nB-50 \n\nLILLIE  YOUNG \n(Negro) \nI'm thirty-two;  my  husband  and  I  are  separated.  I \nhave  six children.  I've  been  in Selma  since  1962. \nMy  daughter,  Marjorie,  age  15,  was  arrested on  a \nTuesday.  I  tried to  see  her  once  in  jail,  but  was  not \nallowed  off  the  elevator.  I  didn't  see  a  sign about \nvisiting hours.  I  went  with my  daughter  to  see  Judge \nReynolds  two  or  three  days  after she  was  arrested.  There \nwas  a  lady  in the  office with  the  judge.  Judge  Reynolds \ninformed me,  \"You  aren't  to  call  yourself Mrs.  Young. \nYou  aren't  recognized  as  a  Mrs.  in this  office.\"  He  asked \nMarjorie  whether Amelia  Boynton had  put  her up  to  the \npicketing.  She  said no,  and he  sent  us  out  of  the  office \nfor 10 minutes,  admonishing Narjorie  to  tell  the  truth. \nAfter we  returned  to  the  office,  Judge  Steynolds  told \nMarjorie,  \"If you  don't  tell me  the  truth,  I'll send  you \nback  to  jail  for  60  days.\"  He  did  send  her back  to  jail, \n\"until  she  could come  up  with  the  right  answers\";  she \ngot  out  the  following  week.  I  did not  know  that my \ndaughter was  going  to  picket;  she  had  no  previous  record. \nI've  attended meetings  at the  churches.  I  haven't  heard \nanyone  advocate  picketing.  I  don't know  if SNCC  sponsored \nthe  meetings. \nB-51 \n\nRUTH  PORTER \n(Negro) \nI'm thirty-six;  I  have  six children.  I  work  for  a \nmanufacturing  company. \nI  went  with my  cousin,  Geraldine  Nitchell,  to  see \nJudge  Reynolds  on July lOe  Her mother had had  a  stroke. \nGeraldine  must  have  been  about  fourteen  then.  She  had \nbeen in  jail for  picketing before,  and  Judge Reynolds \nasked  her  this  time,  \"Remember  what  I  said before  if you \npicketed again?\"  Geraldine  answered,  \"Yes,  you'd  send \nme  to  reform  school.\"  Reynolds  said,  ''VJell,  that 1 s  just \nwhat  I'm going  to  do.\"  I  asked  Judge  Reynolds  how  long \nGeraldine  was  going  to be  in reform  school;  he  replied, \n\"Until  she  learns  how  to  obey the  law.\" \nI  guess  Geraldine  said,  \"All  these  people  are  in \njail,  and  I'm not.\" \nB-52 \n\nDONALD  DAVIS \n(White) \nI  work  for  United Press  International  in !ยทlontgomery. \nI  was  in Atlanta before  that.  I've  covered  quite  a  few \nsituations  involving  ra~ial difficulties. \nI  came  to Selma  on  July 5; tily  boss  at  the Nontgomery \noffice  told me  to  get  to Selma  as  soon as  I  could.  He \nsaid there was  a  racial  disturbance.  SNCC  calls us  fre \nquently;  'tve  check out  their calls.  Hhen  I  arrived,  about \nmidnight,  Selma  was  quiet.  No  one  was  at  the  sheriff's \noffice.  Later  in the  morning  the  next  day,  I  observed \nsome  pickets.  They were  stood  separately and  still,  for \nfive  to  fifteen minutes  before  they were  arrested.  Singers \nand  a  group  of Negroes  were  taken  into custody.  I  observed \ndeputies,  possemen,  some  state conservation officers,  and \nsome  state  troopers.  Deputies  cยทore  grey and  green,  while \npossemen  dress  in khakis.  vfuile . the  mass  arrest was  taking \nplace,  I  attempted  to make  a  phone  call  to my  office  from \nthe  booth  opposite  the  old  side  entrance  of  the  federal \nbuilding.  The  door  to  my  booth 'tvas  shoved  open,  and  a \nsheriff's deputy  told me  to  leave.  He  asked  if I  had  the \nsheriff's permission;  I  said I  thought  i.t  t-tas  unnecessary. \nHe  ignored my  press  credentials,  took  the  phone,  hung  it up, \nand  pushed me  outside.  I  saw  a  posseman  club  a  Negro. \nI  was  at  a  mass  meeting  at  the  Shiloh Church  that \nnight.  There  were  250  to  300  men  in uniform outside  the \nChurch.  They were  dressed  in khaki  and  had  helmets  and \nnightsticks.  The  possemen milled  about  the  Church,  shining \ntheir flashlights  in the windows  of  the  Church.  I  saw  one \nschool  bus  (which could carry thirty men)  at  the  Shiloh \nChurch and  several  cars  both official  and  private.  I  ob \nserved a  rock or some  other object  strike  an unmarked  car \nwith  officials  in it.  I  was  standing by  the  car when  it \nwas  hit.  I  didn't  see  any  blue  uniforms. \nOn  July  7,  I  observed  picketing.  some  deputies \n~Jhen \narrested a  small  boy  who  was  picketing,  one  of th~m said, \n\"He's  so  small  we  ought  to throw him back.\"  At  the  time \nof  the  arrests,  there was  an occasional  passerby,  but  no \ncrowd. \nThe  day  after I  came  to  town  the  pickets  stood on \nthe  steps  of this  [federal]  building. \nB-53 \n\nERNEST  DOYLE! \n(Negro) \nI've lived in Selma  twenty  years.  I'm first  vice \npresident  of the  Dallas County Voters'  League. \nOn  April  4,  1964,  I  went  to  the  courthouse  to vouch \nfor  Negro  applicants  for voter registration.  I  knew  a \nbout  six Negroes  in line  that  day  and  vouched  for  two. \nWhile  I  wasn't  vouching,  I  would  talk to  people  in line. \nI  was  not  told not  to  talk to  people  in line.  In  fact, \nI  saw  a  white  man  tell  another white  man  in line  to go  to \nthe  front  of the line  if he  wanted  to  get  registered.  The \nsheriff drove  me  from  the  area before  I  had  a  chance  to \nvouch  for  the  other four  Negroes  I  knew;  Annie \"\\tJilliam.s, \nRev.  M.  J.  Jackson,  I  believe,  ~1arie King,  I  believe,  and \nSally Gully,  I  believe.  I  wasn't  supposed  to  know  about \nWillie King's  sentence  for murder.  A voucher  vouches  for \nthe  applicant's name,  his  address,  and  how  long  the  voucher \nhas known  him. \nThe  Voters'  League  notified citizens of  the  mass \nmeetings  by  passing out  leaflets.  The  leaflets in exhibit \n22  are  the  type  of announcements  we  passed  out. \nAt  meetings  prior to  July 9,  there were  sheriff's men. \nThere  have  been no  meetings  of  the  Dallas County Voters' \nLeague  since July 9,  1964,  on account  of the  injunction. \nBefore  July 10  the League  printed a  flyer  for  a  July 13 \nmeeting,  but  that meeting was  never held.  I  don't  remember \nwhether  the  meeting  advertised for July 8  was  ever held. \nB-54 \n\nTHONAS  PiiRON \n(White) \nI've been  in the  Selma  police  department  twenty-three \nand  a  half years. \nI  was  driving Chief Mullen  in an unmarked  car at  ./,the \nA.H.E.  Hall  July 5.  ,. .J e  were  parked  about  100  or  200  yards \nsouth of  the  hall.  I  observed  a  lot  of  people,  several \nNegroes  and  20  to  25  possemen.  After  the meeting had \nbroken up,  I  heard  usomething  hit  something.\"  I  heard  a \ndeputy  say he 1d  been hit.  The  tear gas  got  bad,  so  I \ndrove  away  from  the  area and  went  to  the  corner of  Green \nStreet and  Jeff Davis. \nNo  affidavits were  executed  before me,  the  week  of \nJuly  5.  I  did not  issue  any  of the  warrants.  None  of  the \ndocuments  in plaintiff's exhibit  23  were  executed before \nme.  I  am  not  familiar with how  they were  executed.  No \none  requested  permission  from me  before  using  the  rubber \nstamp  with my  name  on  it.ยท  At  the  time  of  the mass  arrests, \nit was  common  practice  at  the  police  department  for others \nto use  my  rubber  stamp.  There  are  many  warrants  bearing \nmy  name  that  I  never  saw. \nB-55 \n\nJOHN  LOVE \n(Negro) \nI  was  born  in New  York City.  I'm twenty-four.  I've \nattended a  technical  school  and  have  a  year of college. \nI've worked  for  SNCC  for  a  little over  a  year. \nI  came  to Selma  in late May  or early June  1964.  At \nfirst,  I  was  to  do  a  voter  registration pamphlet.  Since \nJune  I've been project  director  in Selma. \nNost  of our 'to7ork  has  been  in attempting  to  get  people \nto  go  down  to  register.  \\Je 've  worked  some  on  registration \nitself. \nI  spoke  at  the Green  Street meeting.  I  was  aware  of \nthe  possemen  outside  and,  at the  end  of  the meeting,  I \nasked  the  people  to  go  home  quietly. \nI  was  arrested on  July 6.  The  picket  signs  that were \ndisplayed  said  \"Register  to  Vote\".  I  was  standing on the \nsteps.  The  pickets were  arrested,  and  someone  started to \nsing.  We  all  sang  and  the  sheriff  arrested us.  I  was  told \nat  the  end  of my  jail term that  I  had  been arrested for \ndemonstrating while  court  was  in session and  for  contribut \ning. \nThe  pickets were  minors.  They were  not  paid.  The \npickets were  contacted  in my  office.  I  said it was  impor \ntant  to have  children support  adults.  I  did not  carry a \nsign because  I  did not  think  it was  the  right  time.  At \nthe  Green Street meeting  I  did  not  tell  people  to  come  to \nmy  office.  I  told them  to  get  people  down  to  register, \nand  they came  to  the  office on  their own.  I  do  not  know \nwho  made  the  signs.  Some  non-minors  were  at  the office. \nOn  July 10  I  was  served an  injunction.  On  the  12th \na  regular deputy picked up  on  Jeff Davis,  just off Broad; \nit was  early in the  afternoon.  ''There  wasn't  any  crowd\" .. \nI  was  walking with  a  white  volunteer,  Eric  Farnum.  Mrs. \nBoynton's  daughter-in-law and  two  nieces waved  and  asked  if \nwe  would like  a  ride.  The  police  took  all  five  of us  into \ncustody. \nI  talked with  Chief  Deputy  Crocker.  Farnum  and  another \noยทfficer were  also  present.  Crocker gave  me  his  interpreta \ntion of  the  injunction.  He  said  it was  11broadly worded.\" \nHe  said he  thought  I  could be  arrested if I  were  seen with \ntwo  or more  other persons.  He  said  it could  even be  applied \nto gatherings  in r1y  h.o!ne.  He  said,  though,  that he  wasn't \ngoing  to  be  \"unreasonable,''  that  as  long  as we  behaved our \nselves;  it would be OK. \nThen we  were  taken back to where  we  were  picked up. \nThe  elapsed  time  was  about  thirty to  forty-five minutes. \nB-56 \n\nTHOMAS  BROWN \n(Negro) \nI  have  been with SNCC  for  two  years  and  southern \ncampus  co-ordinator for  6  months.  They pay me  now  and \ndid  in Selma.  I  live  in Atlanta,  Georgia.  I'm twenty \ntwo.  I  got  to my  senior year  in college;  I  attended \nBishop College  in Dallas  and  Butler University  in \nIndianap  ol is. \nI  was  in Selma  from  September 1963  through January \n1964  and  again  in July and August  of 1964.  I  was  project \ndirector  in September 1963.  I  was  arrested then,  but \nnot  in 1964.  In the  summer  of 1964,  I  came  to Selma \nJuly  2.  After John Love  was  arrested,  I  took  over as \nproject  director.  The  type  of projects we  had  include \nvoter registration drives,  literacy projects,  citizenship \nschools;  and  direct  action for  voter registration.  I \nworked  particularly with youngsters.  I  never  encouraged \nstudents  or others  to  commit  acts of  violence  against \nlaw  officers  or to  disregard  the  law.  I  attended approxi \nmately  twenty-three  or  twenty-four mass  meetings.  I  have \nbeen to Americus,  Georgia,  to St.  Augustine,  Florida,  to \nthe  States  of Mississippi,  Georgia,  and  Virginia.  I  was \nnot  in  St.  Augustine  at  the  time  of  civil  disturbances; \nI  was  there  just before  the  disturbances  arose. \nA newspaper  story attributing quotes  to me  concerning \nSelma was  inaccurate.  I  was  talking about Americus.  I \nmade  no  effort  to  correct  the  error. \nB-57 \n\nCHARLtS  JOHNSON \n(Negro) \nI'm 17,  a  student  at R.  B.  Hudson. \nI  was  arrested at  the  Federal Building  on  July 6. \nThat  is  the  only  time  I  have  been  arrested.  I  was  in  jail \nfor  10  days.  On  July 16,  in the  county  jail,  I  went  to -\nthe  fountain  to drink  some  water  and  Sheriff  Clark  appro \nched me.  Sheriff  Clark  stat-ted kicking me  and  said,  \"\"t-Jhat \nin the  hell  are  you doing  drinking from  our  fountain.\" \nJohnson backed  off  and  said,  \"I didn't know  I  wasn't \nsupposed  to use  it.\"  Sheriff Clark kicked me  first in my \nprivates  and  then in my  rectum. \nB-58 \n\nI-\nI \nJOHN  HENRY  SUTTLES \nI \n(Negro) \nI  was  arrested by  the  jail.  I  was  walking up  and \ndown  the  sidewalk on  the  Franklin Street side  of  the  jail, \ncarrying a  sign.  Joe  Smitherman also had  a  sign with him \nthere.  I  do  not  remember  what was  on  the sign.  I  got \nthe  sign \"to the  SNCC's  office;\" ยท[on cross]  I  went  to get it \nbecause  \"I wanted my  freedom.\"  I  don't know  whether  city \ncourt is held there.  The  city police  arrested me.  After \nI  was  arrested I  was  taken first to the city  jail,  then to \nthe  county  jail. ยท  I  was  released on a  Hednesday night, \nabout  a  week  after my  arrest. \nB-59 \nr \n\nhENNY  TUCKER \n(Negro) \nI'm  twenty-four.  I  work  in  Chambers  County  as  an \nagent  for  an  industrial implements  company.  I've been \nconnected with SNCC. \nIn  July,  1964,  SNCC  sent me  to  Hemphis,  Tennessee, \nto  pick up  a  Willys  Jeep which  had been  given  to  the \norganization  from California.  Hhen  I  picked up  the  car, \nit had  California license  plates  on  it.  Dinkley  Rumley \nof SNCC  sent me  a  Georgia license  plate which  I  put on  the \nrear.  I  was  told to  get Alabama  plates.  I  don't know \nwhether  the  car has  ever been  in either California or \nGeorgia~ \nI  knetv  it was  not  stolen,  because  I  had  the  receipt.  It \nwas  purchased  in  the name  of SNCC.  I  think Peter Hall has \nthe  receipt. \nI  drove  the  car to  Selma.  On  Franklin Street the  car \nwas  being  pushed  and  I  was  benind  the wheel when  Sheriff \nClark told me  to  pull over  and  show my  license.  I  do  have \nan Alabama  license.  Sheriff  Clark checked  the  tags  and \nthen  told me  I  was  under  arrest for  improper  tags.  The  car \nhad been  in Alabama  about  three hours  before  I  was  arrested. \nNeither Sheriff Clark nor any  of his men  questioned me  about \nthe  reason  for having  a  1964 Georgia plate on  the  back  and \na  1963  California plate  in  front.  I  was  in  jail for  two \nweeks. \nLast September,  Sheriff Clark grabbed me  when  I  was \nusing  the men's  rest room.  He  took me  to  Judge  Hare.  The \njudge  said,  \"You  think you're  in Chicago?  This  is Selma.\" \n\"I know,\"  I  answered.  Judge  Hare  then  said  I  was  under \narrest. \nB-60 \n\nNILDP..E!O  PARKER \n(i'legro) \nI  live  in Selma.  On  Honday,  July  6,  I  went  down \nto  the  courthouse  about  9  a.m.  I  went  to  the  door on \nLauderdale  Street.  A posseman  asked,  \"Hhat  are  you \ndoing?\"  I  said I  was  trying  to  register.  He  said that \nI  would  \"have  to  go  around  to  the  back.\"  I  went  to  the \nalley on  Lauderdale  Street  [seep.  B-46];  next  to  the \ngarage.  A posseman  there  told me  I  had  to  go  around  to \nthe Alabama  side of  the  courthouse.  I  did,  but did not \nget  in  to  register that day.  I  did get  in  to  apply  to \nregister on  the  following  day. \nB\"!\"6l \n\nJESSE'  LEWELlEN \n(White) \nI've  lived in Selma  forty-two  years.  I  served in \nthe Armed Forces  in France  and  Germany. \nIยท \nI  have  been  a  member  of  the  Dallas County  Sheriff's \nPosse  since  it was  organized.  I  had  no  previous  law \nenforcement experience.  I  am  not  now  a  member  of  the \nKu  Klux  Klan.  I  was  a  member  of  the  Klan  six or eight \nyears  ago.  There  is no  active Klan  chapter in  Dallas \nCounty  now  and  there  has  been  none  for  several years.  I \ndon't know  whether other  posse  members  were  in  the  Klan. \nThe  Sheriff did not  ask me  if I  had  ever been  a  member  of \nthe  Klan.  His  deputies  did not ask either.  Jack  Deramus, \nthe  head of the  posse,  asked me. \nDeramus  contacts  me  for posse work.  \"I don't haveยท \nthe  least idea\" where  he  works  or what  he  does.  I  served \nduring  the  July  4th weekend  at the  Wilby  Theater  and  at  the \nGreen  Street meeting.  I  also  served one  day  at the  court \nhouse  when  they were  picketing.  We  wore  uniforms  and  were \nequipped with side  arms,  sticks,  and helmets. \nHe  do  rescue  work  at floods.  In 196lยทwe  worked  around \nthe  clock to  help both Negroes  and  whites. \nWe've  had  instruction on  how  to  hold  sticks,  to  stay \nin groups ,  and  so  on. \nI  arrived  at Green  Street about  9:00 or 9:15  in  the \nbus.  Some  deputies  were  already  there.  'tJe  lined up  across \nthe  street.  There v1ere  about  35  or 40  possemen.  were \nl~Je \nwearing  unifonns  and  had  sidearms,  sticks,  and  helmets. \nThere  were  250  Negroes  in front of  the  hall.  The  meeting \nwas  still going on.  There  were  lights  on  in  the  hall and \none  small light on  outside  the  hall. \nOne  Negro  said over  and  over that he  had  a  machine  gun \nfrom  !~rea and  that he  was  going  to  go  home  and get  it and \nkill everybody. \nvlhen  the meeting ended  I  saw  the white  photographer. \nHe  went  behind  the  building..  Then  the  light went  out.  I \nheard  rocl's,  bricks or bottles hitting the  automobiles. \nThere  were  four  or five  at first,  then  there were  quite  a \nfew  of  them.  Chief  Crocker  told us  to move  in  and  break \nit up.  tve  \"just told them  to  go  home.\"  I  went  in  toward \nthe  church and  ste.yed  around  the  church.  I  do  not know  how \nfar  from  the  church  any  of the  other possemen  went. \nB-62 ยท \n\nThere was  lots  of noise.  It was  all over  in  just \na  few  minutes.  I  did not  hear1 a  shot  fired. \nThe  white  photographers  came  around  the  building \nand  sat down.  Someone  told them  to  go  home  and  they got \nup  and  left.  I. was  about  as  far  from  them  as  from here \nto you  (witness  stand to  counsel  table).  They  did not \nappear  to  be hurt.  I  did not  see  them  get  injured and \ndid not break their  I  did not \nphoto~raphic equipment~ \nbeat any  Negroes  and  did not  see  any  Negroes  abused.  I \ndid not  see  any  posse members  get hurt. \nB-62-b \n\nJESSE \nS~ITTH \n(White) \nI  am  from  Selma  and  I  am  a  member  of  the Sheriff's \nWater Pcsse.  I  have  received instruction from  Sheriff \nClark on  how  to  get  people  out  of  the  river when  they \ndrown.  We  were  also  instructed that  when  there was  trouble \nto disperse  it,  regardless  of where  it comes  from.  At  the \nflood  we  hauled  out  2500  Negroes.  I  was  called  in July, \nbut  I  was  not  at  the Wilby  and  was  not  at  Green Street.  I \nwas  at  the  courthouse  in the grand  jury room  on July 6. \nI  attended  a  meeting  at which Mr.  McLeod  spoke  about  integra \ntion,  but  I  deยท not  recall his  saying  \"we  must  meet  force  with \nforce.  The  day of  passive  resistence  is past.\"  I  am  not  a \nmember  of the Ku  Klux Klan  or  the States Rights  Party. \nB-63 \n\nCLIFTON  PRESSLEY \n(vJhite) \nยทI live in Selma;  I've always  lived in Dallas  County. \nI'm a  carman  for  the Southern Railway.  I  was  in the navy \nsix to  eight months. \nI  have  been a  member  of  the Sheriff's posse  from  one \nand  a  half to  two  years.  I  am  not  a  member  of  the Ku  Klux \nKlan.  The  Sheriff has  instructed us  to  \"keep  the peace  on \nboth  sides,\" to  remain  \"as  calm  as  we  can.\"  He  has  told \nus  how  to  protect ourselves  in case there  is a  riot.  I  have \nnever  received any  instruction in the use  of  tear gas.  As \npart  of my  duties  I  have  patrolled four  or  five meetings. \nWe  were  on  standby for  each meeting.  I  was  not  at  the Wilby \nor at the Shiloh Church,  but  I  was  at Green Street.  I  went \nto  the A.M.E.  Hall  on  the  bus  at about  9:00.  There were \n30  or 40  posse members  there.  I  had  a  bad back  so  I  stayed \non the  bus  which was  across  the street  from  the hall.  I \nstayed on  the  bus  until the  tear gas  ran me  out.  I  did not \nhave  a  clear view.  There  were  about  150  to  200  Negroes. \nThe  light outside  the hall was  on  for  a  while~  The  Negroes \n\"come  out  peaceful  as  you want  'em\"  and  started dispersing. \nAll  of  a  sudden there came  rocks  and  bricks.  It sounded \nlike thunder.  The  rocks  1;-1ere  coming  from  the  area around \nthe  alley next  to  the  church.  Then  the  tear gas  was  used. \nAfter it was  all over  I  saw the two  white  photographers  in \na  car.  Someone  had helped  them  into  the  car.  I  did not \nsee  the  sheriff talk to them.  I  did not  see  any  possemen \nabuse  a  Negro.  On  the way  back  in the  bus  nothing was  said \nabout  the  photographers  being  hurt  that  night.  He  did talk \nabout  who  they might  be. \nB-64 \n\nJAMES  HARRIS \n(White) \nI'm forty-two  and  live  at  Route  four.  I  went  to \nthe  eighth grade;  I  own  a  company. \nI 1ve  been a  member  of the  Sheriff's  Hater Posse \never since  it was  started.  I  have  had  no  police  train \ning.  I  have  never had  to use  weapons  in connection with \nmy  posse work,  but  I  have  been  shown  how  to use  them by \nmembers  of  the  posse.  No  one  e~:ยทse showed  me  how  to use \nthem.  I  have  had  no  training  in the  use  of  gas.  The \npurpose  of the  water  posse  is  to  help out  in drownings. \nDuring  the  flood  we  handled both  races.  We  removed  Negroes \nfrom  flooded  areas  and  provided  them with  food.  I  was  a \nmember  of  the Ku  Klux  Klan  about  ten years  ago.  I  didn't \nlike  it so  I  quit  after about  a  month.  During  July I  was \non  duty at Green Street;  I  was  not  on duty at  the  court \nhouse,  at  the Wilby,  or at  the  Shiloh Church.  We  wear  a \ngrey uniform and  carry a  badge,  a  gun,  and  a  stick and wear \na  helmet. \nI  went  to  the  Green  Street  Church  in the  bus  with \nabout  40  or 45  possemen.  Mr.  Crocker  was  in charge.  I \nnever  did  get  right up  next  to  the  church.  I  was  about \none-half block away.  I  did not  see  the  two  white  photo \ngraphers.  I  heard  about  their presence  there,  but  I  did \nnot  hear of  any  injuries  to  them.  I  rode  back in a  car. \nThere  were  four  or  five  bricks  thrown  in the  street \nor  thrown  at us.  After  the lights went  out  a  lot of  rocks \nwere  thrown.  I  did not  see  any  posse  members  hit  or abuse \nNegroes.  After  it was  over I  saw  Sheriff Clark.  I  did \nnot  hear a  shot. \nB-65 \n\nALVERY  WILLIAMS \n(Negro) \nI'm twenty-two;  I'm from  Gadsden,  Alabama.  I'm a \nsophomore  at Alabama A&M.  I  was  a  SNCC  worker  for  one \nand  a  half years.  I  worked  in Selma  in September  of \n1963.  I  was  here  in July 1964  as  a  SNCC  employee,  work \ning  on voter registration. \nI  went  to  the  Wilby Theater  between  5  and  5:30  on \nJuly 4.  There  were  a  lot of  Negro  kids  in front  of the \ntheater.  I  went  across  Broad  Street  and  saw  some  kids \nwho  wanted  to go  to  the movie.  Charles  Robertson went \non  in. \nThree  whites were  standing outside  the  theater. \nOne  of  them had  a  knife  and  advanced  toward  the  crowd. \nSheriff Clark pulled up and  got  out  and  dispersed  the \ncrowd.  Before  that,  I  asked  Sheriff Clark whether he \nsaw  that.  He  asked  if I  would  swear out  a  warrant.  I \ncouldn't  because  I  didn't know  the whites.  Deputy  Stokes \nand  Clark got  out  swinging  their sticks.  One  swung  at \nme,  but  I  got  away.  Later that  day,  I  was  charged with \ndisturbing  the  peace.  Several  days  later, Clark charged \nme  with  inciting to  riot.  I  was  in  jail about  two  weeks. \nI  did  not  ask ยทpeople  to  go  to  the  theater.  The  boy \nwho  came  with me  wanted  to  go  to  the  movie.  I  went  over \nto  see  the  children because  I  wanted  to  talk with  them. \nI  said nothing  about  the  picture  to  them.  I  had  about \nfour  or  five  kids  with me  canvassing  that  day;  most  were \nminors.  We  went  to  the  Freedom House.  lโขTe  parked  at  Jeff \nDavis  and  walked.  One  grownup  was  with me,  Charles  Robertson. \nI  wanted  to go  to  the  movie,  but  never got  in. \nB-66 \n\nCARL  GABEL \n(White) \nI  have  been with the  Department  of  Justice  for  three \nyears  in  the  Civil  Rights  Division.

I \nattend Selma University. \nI  was  arrested in September  of  1963  and  put  in  jail \nfor  unlawful  assembly.  I  had been standing  at  the  old \nPost  Office watching  other students  picket  at the  time  of \nmy  arrest.  [On  Cross]  I  had gone  downtown  after  \"we  made \nour minds  up  because  of  the  treatment  our  people was \ngetting.tt  For  example,  a  friend  of mine  was  hit in the \nhead  at  Carter Drug.  I  do  not know  why,  of my  own  knowledge. \nSome  other  students  and  I  had  talked about demon \nstrating among  ourselves.  We  had decided  to  demonstrate, \nand  then  talk to  some  SNCC  people  and  attend mass  meetings \nto  find  out how  to  protest.  t~en I  was  arrested  I  knew \nsome  of  the  SNCC  people  in the  high school,  but  I  did not \nknow  the  officials. \nAfter  I  was  arrested and  put  in  jail in September \n1963,  I. was  brought  to  the  courthouse  one  night.  Judge \nHare  was  there,  as  well  as  another  person  I  thought was \nJudge  Reynolds.  There  [indicating]  is Judge  Hare,  but  I \ndon't  recognize  Judge Reynolds.  Sheriff Clark was  at \nthe  meeting;  Dr,;  Owens  was  also at  the  meeting.  There -- \nwere  others  I  did not recognize.  A  judge  asked  the \nstu~ \ndents  if we  wanted  to  go  back to school.  I  signed a \npaper,  and  the  judge  explained  that we  were  on  a  year's \nprobation and  if we  were  at any  mass  meetings,  we  would  be \ngiven  three months  hard  labor.  I  was  let out  of  jail and \nallowed  to go  back  to  school;  my  probation was  for  a  year, \nnot  for  nine  months.  I  do  not know  who  stated that  the \nprobation would  be  for  a  year,  but  I  was  informed  that  the \nman  wasยท a  judge.  I  did go  back  to  school  and have  not \nbeen  threatened  since. \nI  talked to  2 white  persons  prior  to  testifying. \nI  also  talked  to :Alvery  'Hilliams  in the  hall prior  to \ntestifying,  but  did  not discuss  the  case. \nB-69 \n\nOEFENDANTS 1  \"'liTNESSES \n\n-\nยท. \ndEORG}:  STOVES \n(\\tJhite) \n[I  am  assistant  chief deputy  to  Sheriff Clark;  see \nStoves  prior testimony,  p.

The  speaker was  Bob  Smith  of Mobile. \nAbout  thirty to  for.ty  or more  were  present.  Smith  said \nthere would  be more  Negro  meetings,  and  asked  the men  to \nuse  theiiโข guns  --- \"blazing and  shooting.\"  Smith  advocated \nviolence.  Only whites  were  at  the  meeting. \nSelma was  \"very tense\"  from  June  to  July 9,  1964; \nfeeling  ran high among  Negroes  and  white  people.  Relations \nbetween the  races  had  deteriorated  since last  fall. \nI  attended mass  meetings  in the  spring of  1964  with \nstate  investigator Rufus  Head,  with  whom  I  work  closely. \nI  prepared the  report  on  the  June  1,  1964 meeting  and \nprobably prepared  the  report  on  the  June  8  meeting.  At \na  meeting  at  the  First  Baptist  Church  Negro  ministers \nasked me  not  to  come  in.  \"'-Je  did  not  go  in.''  I  also \nattended  a  meeting  itrMarengo County  on  June  21,  1964. \nAt  one  meeting  Rev.  Anderson  gave  a  speech  about  a \nNegro  woman  on  a  city bus  who  was  asked  to go  to  the  rear. \nAnderson  said he  was  ready  to go  to  hell  to  keep  from \nletting Negro  women  be  pushed  around.  At  the  July 6,  1964 \nmeeting  Rev.  Abernathy  said  they would  ''bury  segregation.\" \nThere  was  no  violence  at  the meeting,  but  on  the way  home \nI  heard  a  radio  report  of  some  rock  throwing. \nI  don't  recall whether  I  attended  any meeting between \nJune  21,  1964,  and  July  S,  1964.  ยท \nRu~us Head  and  I  attended  the  Green Street meeting. \nc. \nWillie  Robertson  said that  since  the  Civil  Rights Act \nhad  passed we  can do  anything we  want  to  now;  we  don't \nhave  to  go  out  and  rape  white  women.  Then  there  was  a  lot \nof  jumping up and  dm11n,  and  a  stove  pipe  fell.  \"They \nwere  singing their violent  songs  when  I  left the  meeting.\" \nHead  and  I  were  parked a  little south of  the  hall  on \nthe  same  side  of the  street as  the  hall.  I  heard  a  rock \nhit  the  car,  got  out  and  picked  it up  from  near  the \n~ront \nof  the  car for  ev;idence,  and  then got  back  in the  car. \nHead  was  still in the  car  and  the  radio was  still working. \nA short  time  later several more  rocks  came.  I  got  out  and \npicked up  a  rock  right beside  the  car.  Then  I  heard  a  shot \nand  there  was  a  barrage  of  rocks.  The  lights went  out  and \nthen Crocker,  who  was  in charge,  ordered  the  crowd  dispersed. \nC-1 \n\nCrocker  did not  have  a  megaphone  and  gave  no  instructions \nto  the  crowd.  The  tear gas  was  heavy,  but  I  helped  dis \nperse  the  crowd. \nI  saw  the  two  photographers  twice;  once  when  I  came \nout  of  the  hall  and  later,  one  was  lying and  one  sitting \non  the  ground. \nThere  were  about  forty men  from  the, sheriff's depart \nment  there.  I  belieye  the  sheriff's office had  five  cars \nat  that  time  (all  radio-equipped),  of which  four were  at \nthe  hall  that  night.  There  was  also  a  school-type  bus \n(not  radio-equipped).

I  cover  Dallas,  Perry,  Hilcox,  Sumter,  and \nNarengo Counties. \nOn  June  20,  1964,  as  a  part  of my  duties,  I  attended \na  meeting  of  the  National  States  Rights  Party  in a  pasture \noff Highway  80.  Attendance  was  about  twenty-five.  A \nBob  Smith  of Hobile  spoke  of  violence  and wanted white \npeople  to  get  together  and when  Negroes  start marching, \nwalk  all  over  them.  Smith wanted  to  form  an army  like \nthey had  in Hississippi and  spoke  of  a  million Jews  and \nNegroes  floating  down  the  Hississippi River.  Smith  re \nferred  to  the  Bible  as  proving white  men  Hould  win. \nSmith wanted  a  committee  of ten,  each to  call  three,  and \nasked  for  an army  of 1500.  He  said demonstrations  t..rere \ncoming  and  they  should  get  guns  and  keep  \"both barrels \nblazing\".  Edward  Fields was  introduced  as  field director. \nAt  the  June  1,  meeting  of  Negroes  at  the  Mt. \n196!~ \nArarat  Baptist Church  about  250  Negroes  were  present. \nL.  L.  Anderson,  \"Be  prepared.  I'm  ready  to  go  to hell  rather \nthan have  our women  pushed  around. \"  There  was  a  lot  of \nsinging  and clapping. \nI  attended  the mass  meeting  on July  6,  1964  at which \nRev.  Abernathy  spoke  and  said he  was  th.ere  to help  \"bury \nsegregation.\"  The  church was  full.  I  understand  two  or \nthree  rocks  were  thrown  after  I  left. \nI  attended Negro  meetings  when  requested by  the  Depart \nment  of Public Safety.  I  have  a  sheriff's deputy with me \nat  all  times.  I  report  on  all meetings;  Deputy  Stoves  has \nhelped me  prepare  my  reports.  t-Je  take  no  notes.  Possemen \nhave  been outside  some  of the  meetings.  The  purpose  of the \nposse  is  the  \"protection of  the  people.\" \nI  was  in Birmingham  in the  summer  of 1963  and  can \ncompare  that  situation 'Iilith  Selma  from  July 1-6,  1964. \nIn Selma  \"it was  an  explosive  situation.\"  There  tvere \nmany  outsiders  in Selma.  Selma  faced  a  chance  of almost \na  complete  breakdown  of law and  order.  I  don't  remember \nwhether  I  lvas  here  after July 6;  my  judgment  is  based on \n'liJhat  I  sa't-1  through  July 6. \nI  was  present  when  the  complaint  for  the  injunction \nwas  filed,  and  I  provided  information  for  the  complaint. \nI  took  affidavits  from  John Harren,  Ruby  Allen,  George  M. \nv. \nCorson,  James  Jones,  George  King,  and Pete Holfe. \nDeputy Stoves  assisted me.  He  took  the  other affidavits \nin the  exhibit  [Def.  Ex.  No.  12].  I  don't  remember  when \nI  took Parren's  affidavit.  I  don't  remember  if it was \nright  after  the Thirsty Boy. \nC-2  . \n\nOn  July 4,  1964,  I  was  in the  sheriff's office \nwhen  he  got  the  call about  the  Doy. \nThirct~/  CL:-.1\"~:: \n~nd I  filmnedic!. tely ~:en'c  to  th-0.  Thirsty Boy.  Deputieยทsยท \nHewston and  Bates  were  there.  I  saw  Clark and  Hewston \ntalk to the  owner,  but  couldn't hear  the  conversation \nsince  I  stayed outside.  Someone  had warrants.  Clark \ncame  out  with  the  four  Negroes.  I  did not  see  anyone \nabuse  the  Negroes  in any way  from  the  time  they came \nout  of the  Thirsty Boy  until  they were  put  in the  car. \nI  then  returned  to the  courthouse;  I  did not  go  with  the \nothers  to  the  jail. \nAfter I  returned  to  the  courthouse  from  the  Thirsty \nBoy,  I  drove  around  for a  couple  of hours.  Then  Sheriff \nClark and  I  were  \"just  patrolling around''  and  observed \nfm:ยทt~r.  to  fifty Negroes,  ati.d  five  or six white  boys  around \nthe  vJilby Theater.  'VJe  arrived  first,  before  any  possemen. \nThere  were  white  people  sitting on their parked  cars. \nThere  't'lere  twenty to  thirty white  people  on  the  Carter Drug \ncorner  and  fifteen or  twenty people,  both Negro  and  white, \nat  the Woolworth  corner.  I  did not  know,  when  we  got  to \nthe vJilby,  that  there  were  Negroes  inside.  Alvery Williams \nstopped us  in the  street.  We  were  headed  east,  toward  the \nSilver Moon  Cafe.  Williams  said  that white  people  were \ncreating a  disturbance  and  he  wanted  them  arrested.  Clark \nasked Williams  to  sign a  warrant,  but  said no. \n~,Jilliams \nWilliams  then turned  and  said  something  to  the  crowd, \nwhich  began whooping  and  hollering.  Clark and  I  told \neveryone,  \"the white  and  the  colored,\"  to leave.  We \ndispersed  the  crowd;  we  removed  white  people  in front  of \nl.Jilby.  We  dispersed crowds  \"all  over  town.\"  I  didn't \nsee  anyone  hit.  Clark and  I  left together. \nI  was  aware  the Civil  Rights  Act  applied to  the Wilby. \nI  assumed  there  had  been  segregated seating  there  before. \nDeputy Stoves  and  I  went  inside  the  building  to attend \nthe  Green Street meeting.  We  arrived before  any  other \nmembers  of  the  sheriff's department.  A:t  first  there were \nfifty to  seventy-five  Negroes  there.  Later the  crowd  grew \nto  250-300.  At  the  meeting  there  was  jumping  up and down, \nnoise,  freedom  songs;  a  stove  pipe  fell  down.  Willie c. \nRobinson,  a  speaker  at the  meeting,  said,  they accuse  us \nof  raping  white  women,  but  \"you  don't  have  to  rape  a  white \nwoman.\"  I  don't  recall  any  recess  in the  meeting.  Stoves \nand  I  left during  the  singing.  The  meeting  broke  up  around \n9:30. \nCrocker  told us  all had  been quiet,  except  that  a  few \nrocks  had  been thrown.  I  started my  car when  a  barrage  of \nrocks  came  and  several  rocks  hit my  car.  [Defendants  Ex. \nNo.  6F]  shows  the  damage  to my  car.  Crocker ordered tear \ngas  fired.  I  went  to my  car  trunk and  got  out  my  gas mask. \nI  called the  highway  patrol  station to  contact  Col.  Lingo \nand  Sheriff Clark.  I  didn't know  where  Colonel  Lingo  was. \nC-2-b \n\nI  called station 27  because  it's the  only State Trooper \noutfit  in  the  area.  Stoves  and  I  got  out  of  the  car after \nthe  barrage  and,  with  Crocker,  recovered  two  rocks.  [Def. \nEx.  No.  6B]is  a  picture  of the  rock  that  hit my  automobile \n[Def.  Ex.

After \nthe  tear gas  was  fired  I  sawยท one  of them lying on  the \nground  and  one  squatting.  Iยทtook off my  gas  identi \nmas~, \nfied myself  as  a  state  investigator and  asked  the  blond \nman  what  happened.  \"I  don't know;  as  I  came  out  of  the \nchurch,  a  Negro  grabbed me.\"  The  other said he  had  lost \nhis glasses.  Crocker offered to  get  them medical  attention, \nbut  they  siad  they didn't  need  it.  Some  possemen were \nstanding around  the  two men.  I  did not  see  possemen  throw \nthe  camera  against  a  wall.  I  didn't  see  anyone  abuse  the \ntwo  men. \nAfter  the meeting  I  made  a  handwritten  affidavit \n[Pl.  Ex.  No.  35].  I  made  it at  the  courthouse.  I  don't \nremember when.  If it's dated  July  5,  that must  be  right. \nI  think Mr.  Pitts may  have  been  there.  I  don't  recall \nmru<ing  or  swearing  to  this  typewritten affidavit  [Pl.  Ex. \nNo.  36].  The  two  affidavits  are  the  same. \nI  make  written reports  on all my  investigations.  I \nmade  one  on  the  Green Street meeting.  I  thought  I  brought \nit in,  but  it is not  here.  I'll check  for  it this  evening. \nC-2-c \n\nLEONARD  Q~OCI<Eg \n(vfuite) \n[I  am  Sheriff Clark'sยท chief deputy;  see  summary  of \nhis  prior testimony,  p.  B-29]. \nI  attended  a  meeting  of  the  National States  Rights \nParty with Rufus  Head,  Stoves,  and Nichols.  Bob  Smith \nfrom  Hobile  spoke.  He  encouraged whites  to  meet  Negroes \nin  the  streets,  to meet  them not with the  butts of  their \nrifles  firstt  but with  the barrels  first and  with  \"both \nbarrels blaz~ng.\"  He  said there  were  60,000 men  ready  to \ndo  this  in Hississippi. \nThere  were  about  ten  lawmen  present when  I  arrived at \nthe A.H.E.  hall.  Head  and  Stoves were  there,  but were \ninside  the meeting.  There  was  a  brief recess  about  ten or \nfifteen  minutes  after I  arrived.  The  meeting  broke  up  at \n9:30 or 9:45.  The  Negroes  were milling  around,  chanting. \nI  was  standing by my  car,  which was  directly opposite  the \nchurch.  The  deputies  and  possemen  were  lined up  on  that \nside.  Head's  car was  on  the  side of the  street where  the \nmeeting  hall was.  Two  white  men  came  out.  I  had  seen  them \nearlier,  either that day  or the  day  before.  At  that  I \nt~e \nhad  asked  for  information,  which  they  provided.  My  reason \nfor  seeking  information had been  the  Philadelphia,  l:Iissis \nsippi incident  and  the  fact  that  feelings  were  running  high \nin  Selma.  Nyonly  thought  had  been  that  if anything \nhappened  to  the men,  the  sheriff's office  could  care  for \nthem better if it had  the  information.  It is my  handwriting \nthat  appears  on  plaintiff's exhibit 11  and  12.  There  is \nnothing  out of the  ordinary  for  those  men  to  talk with me. \nI  probably  couldn't even  recognize  them now.  When  the  first \npeople  came  out of  the meeting hall;  they went  straight to \nan  alley  just south of  the  Green  Street hall and  across  the \nstreet.  Almost  immediately,  bricks  and  other missiles \nbegan  flying.  It was  a  minute  or more  later that  I  gave  the \norder  to  disperse  the  crowd.  1-:ieanwhile,  I  had  heard what \nsounded  like  a  muffled shot  and  then  barrage of objects. \nI  noticed  the  photographer  trying  to  focus  his  camera. \nMost  of  the  Negroes  ran  toward  the  two  white u..ewsmen.  Later \nI  saw  two  bodies  on  the  ground.  I  said nothing  at that  time \nto  them,  but  asked  an  officer near  them whether  they  needed \nmedical  help.  I  gave  orders  that  if the  men  did  need help \nto  let me  know.  I  never  saw  any  posseman or deputy  abuse \nthe  newsmen.  I  never  saw  any  posseman  strike  a  Negro.  I \nsaw HcLeod  at the  scene,  but  do  not remember  any  conversation \nbetween ยฃ:1cLeod  and  the  newsmen.  After  things  had  quieted \ndown  sometV'hat,  six to  eight men  in  groups  patrolled the \nimmediate  area,  to  be  sure  crowds  had  broken  up.  This  type \nof  patrolling went  on  from  forty-five minutes  to  an  hour. \nDuring  this  time,  we  picked up  stones  [Def.  Ex.  Nos.  7  and  8]. \nC-3 \n\nGreen  Street  is  an  ordinary unpaved  dirt street, \nwith  no  rocks  in  the  street.  ~r7e  made  no  reconnaisance \nbefore  the meeting.  I  went back to  the  courthouse  at \nabout  11:30.  Head was  there  at that  time.  I  do  not \nremember  how  long  I  stayed.  I  gave  two  affidavits \n[Def.  Ex.

Two  whites  left \nwhen  they  heard Negroes  were  inside.  One  white  man  came  up \nand  told  the  two  Negroes  who  h~d bought  tickets  that  they \nwere  not going  in.  The  boy whf}ยทhad  been bringing  kids  up \nto  the  theater had  a  heated 4iยงcussion with  the white man, \nthen  the  two  Negroes  came  back.  Nr.  Butler came  up  and \nsaid,  11Duck.\"  He  said he  saw  a.  colored boy  swinging  a \nbottle.โข  I  faced  the  newsstand  and  couldn't see  to  the  left \nwithout  turningโข  _I  only noticed  a  crowd.  I  noticed Sheriff \nClark :drive up;  Iยทc:lon't  remember  se.eing  any  Negro  talk to  Clark \nPrior  to  this  time;  Ihadurged Butler  to  call  the  police. \nButler said he  was  fixing  to  do  that.  I  was  afraid  there \nwas  going  to  be  a  fight..  I  believe  that Clark tried to \ndisperse  the  ~rowd,  after which  he  went  into  Butler's office. \nAfter the  Negroes  came  out,  I  think,  which was  after the  crowd \nwas  dispersedt  Hr.  Butler and Sheriff  Clark talked.  Hr. \nButler  told me  Sheriff Clark had  advised him  to  close.  He \nsaid to  finish  the  film  that was  on,  then  to  quit. \nC-4 \n\nDOROTHY  OLIVER \n(White) \nI'm nineteen;  I  work  as  a  cashier at  the V.Tilby \nTheater. \nI  t'lorked  from  1:15  to  5:30  p.m.  at  the  Theater \n'~'-7ilby \non  July 4,  1964.  Hrs.  Hoore  relieved me.  I  opened  the \nbox  office at 1:45 or 1:50.  There was  a  big  crowd of white \nand  colored  outside,  more  colored  than white.  I  did not \nsell any  tickets  to Negroes  in the white  section until  the \nNegro  balcony was  filled.  The  Negroes  were  children and \nteen-agers  up  to  the  age  of  twenty-seven.  I  did not  see  any \nolder Negroes  bring others  up  to  the  tiGket  window.  After \nthe  Negro  balcony was  filled,  I  started selling tickets  on \nthe white  side.  The  first  tickets were  sold  about  4  p.m. \nI  saw  about  fifteen  or  twenty Negroes  on  the  grass  at Mrs. \nAdams'  house  next  to  theยท theater.  I  didn't  see  any whites \ntry to obstruct Negroes  attempting  to enter the  theater. \nI  saw  several  police  cars  go  by  the  theater  \"from \ntime  to  time.\"  They were  city police  cars.  I  did not  notice \nany  sheriff's  cars  or  possemen. \nI  talked once  to  the  FBI,  a  couple  of days  later. \nC-5 \n\nROGER \nB~ER \n(\\ยท1hite) \nI'm  the  manager  of the l,Jilby Theater. \nThe  theater opened  at  about  1:45  on July 4,  1964. \nI  arrived about  10  a.m.  No  one  was  waiting  to  get  in at \nthat  time.  At  opening  time,  sizable  lines had  been  formed \nat  the  colored  and  white  ticket  windows.  The  lines were \norderly.  The  second  balcony  filled about  an hour  after \nthe  opening  of  the  theater.  After  that,  most  of the  per \nsons waiting to1ere  Negro  youngsters.  No  Negroes  tried to \nbuy  any  tickets  for  the  white  section at  that  time,  they \ndid  not  start until  about  5:30.  At  about  5:30  (4:30?] \n., \nI  asked  if any  Negroes  wanted  to  test now.  They  said, \n\"Yes.\"  I  suggested  that  they come  back  when  the  situation \nwas  less  explosive,  but  the  Negroes  wanted  to  go  ahead. \nI  said OK,  and  sold  tickets  to  about  seventeen Negroes. \nThe  crowd  was  milling around.  There  were  a  few  whites \nacross  the  street  and  a  lot of whites  on Carter corner. \nThere  were  a  few  in front  of  the  theater.  There  were  some \nroughly-dressed,  rough-looking  characters. \nAt  3  o'clock,  or 3:30p.m.,  across  the  street  in front \nof  the  finance  company,  a  small  teen-age  Negro  and  a  large \nwhite  man  swung  at  each  other.  A  large  colored man  went \nover  from  the Hilby.  It looked  as  if trouble  was  brewing, \nso  I  called  the  police.  A car came  within a  few  minutes. \nMeanwhile,  the  situation ironed  itself out. \nA  few  minutes  later,  three  white  men  standing  against \nthe  fence  next  door,  called a  police  car.  The  men  said \nthere  was  a  man  with  a  knife. \nThe  situation eased up.  The  box  office  continued  to \nsell  tickets,  but  that  did not  reduce  the  size  of  the  crowd \nvery much.  There  were  sheriff's cars  nearby.  I  did  not \nsee  Clark until  5:30  or  so. \nAt  5:30,  there  was  a  new  run on  the  office;  about \nseventeen to  twenty Negroes  bought  tickets  for  the  white \nsection.  I  was  calling the  police  from  the  cashier's box, \nwhen  two  persons  asked  for  their money  back.  Out  of  the \nwindow,  I  saw  a  Negro  man  with  a  bottle  in his hand  and \nhis  arm  drawn  back.  I  told  the  cashier  to  get  down.  I \nwas  calling the  police  because  it had looked like  to me \nthere  was  going  to be  a  big bra'{<ll.  This  was  about  fifteen \nminutes  after the  Negroes  had  come  to  the  Theater.  Then \nI  saw  Sheriff Clark.  He  had  been  there  before,  but  had \nleft. \nC-6 \n\nA crowd  of whites  rushed up  to  the  theater,  and \nsomeone  hollered that  there  were  niggers  in the  theater. \nI  asked  for  a  chance  to  work  it out.  .-\\I  told  the  situa \ntion to  the  Negroes  in the  theater,  they were  anxious  to \nleave.  Some  men  hollered,  11Get  out  of  here.  You  don't \nbelong.\"  I  saw  no  one  get  hit.  The  Negroes  went  out  the \nfront  while  I  went  out  the  back.  I  did not  see  the  posse \nabuse  Negroes.  Trouble  did not  broil  up  whenever  the \npossemen left.  There  was  no  trouble  after  the  Negroes \nleft  the  theater.  The  box  office  closed  down. \nI  called my  theater chain.  John Doar  told me  I \nshouldn't have  exaggerated when  I  called. \nI  get most  of my  movies  from Atlanta. \nI  do  not  know  how  many  times  I  phoned  the  police \non July 4.  I  did not  call  the  police before  6  p.m.  for \nany  incidents  at  the  ยทuilby Theater.  I  called once  about \nsome  hoods  at  the Halton Theater,  about  ten a.m.  Both \npolice  and  sheriff's cars  patrolled  regularly on July 4. \nWhen  the  theater opened,  a  sheriff's car was  at  the \ntheater,  but  it left.  There  \"t~lere  no  lmvmen  in the  area \nwhen  the  rough-looking  't-vhites  were  there.  No  lawmen \nattempted  to make  it possible  for  the  Negroes  to  enter \nthe  white  section of  the  theater. \nSeating  at  the Wilby Theater,  as  well  as  at  the vJalton, \nwas  segregated until  July 4,  1964.  Now  Negroes  sit wher \never  they please  in the  theater.  There  has  been only  one \nsmall  incident  since  then.  There  was  an unruly  crowd  in \nthe  second  balcony.  \"Jhites  were  interfering with  the \nNegroes.  I  called the  police  on  that  occasion. \nC-6-b \n\nJOliN  CLOUD \n(VJhite) \nI  work  for  the Alabama Department  of  Public Safety. \nI  am  the major  in  charge  of  the  patrol,  or enforcement \ndivision.  I  supervise  the  supervisors  for  eleven  districts. \n11y  immediate  supervisor  is  Colonel  Lingo.  I  place  troops \non  orders  from Colonel Lingo. \nDuring  the  last part of  June  or first part of July, \n1964,  I  sent extra troopers  to  Selma.  This  was  done  on \nthe basis  of  reports  from  the  district supervisors  and on \nthe  basis  of Col.  Lingo's  personal observation.  ltle  never \nsent more  than  twenty  troopers.  Some  troopers  were  placed \non  standby,  also.  Two  hundred  troopers  were  on  alert once. \n~eports from  state  investigators  indicated the  situation \nwas  tense. \nl  came  to  Selma  July 4  or s.  I  saw  a  goodly number \nof white  groups  gathered  around,  especially by  the  theaters. \nI  saw  some  cars  from  outside the  county.  There was  a  large \nnumber  of NSRP  and  sfmilar elements  from  Shelton  and Autauga \nCounties.  I  saw  several  tags  from  those  counties. \nI  observed  the  situation  in Birmingham  for  two  or three \nweeks  prior to  the  riots.  1\\le  conditions  in Selma were \nfollowing  a  pattern  similar to  that which  preceded  the \nBirmingham riot.  The  scale was  smaller,  but  the  pattern \nwas  similar.  I  did not  think that Sheriff Clark could handle \nthe  situation which  I  thought might  arise. \nI  have  had  a  large  amount  of experience with  \"first \ntimes\"  for  integration.  It is  a  good  idea to  take  special \nprecautions.  I  was  in Selma  only until dark on  July  5. \nCol.  Lingo  stayed.  The  Department of  Safety had men  on \nstandby  at a  hotel  after the  incident  at the A.H.E.  hall. \nThey  patrolled the  city.  There were  no  state patrol person \nnel at the Green  Street  Church  as  far  as  I  know.  State \ntroopers  patrolled the  city streets  in Selma on  the night \ns. \nof  July \nOur main  radio  station  is  on  the  highway.  The  Sheriff's \noffice has  a  base  station.

The  shop has  a  big window;  'it's like \nsitting outside.  July 4  was  a  holiday but  I  went  down  to \nthe  shop  anyway.  Around  11 o'clock I  got  a  paper  and \nbegan  to  read  it. \nAround  12:30  I  saw  a  lot of  colored people  gathering. \nThe  crowd  kept yelling and yelling.  It was  lined up  toward \nHashington Street.  About  fifteen  or twenty-five  Negroes \ngathered by t.Voolworth 's;  so  did a  few  whites.  There  tvas \nanother  crowd by  Kress's  and  some  other crowds. \nI  was  sitting  inside  the  shop  when  the  box office \nopened.  Hothing  different happened  from what  had happened \nover  the  past  forty years.  Negroes  went  into  the  second \nbalcony. \nI  saw  two  or three Negroes  going back and  forth between \nthe  groups  of Negroes.  There  were  no  whites  except  ticket \nbuyers  until later.  Then  four  or five  whites.  ยท \nAs  soon  as  the  upstairs  got full  the  Negro  adults \nbought  tickets  and went  in on  the  previously white  side \nabout  twenty  or twenty-five.  About  twenty-five  or thirty \nminutes  later a  group of  Negroes  carne  out.  I  saw  a  leader \nof  the  colored group  say  to  Sheriff Clark,  ~~~ove that crowd \nof ttthites.\"  I  didn't hear Clark's  reply.  Then,  the  Negro \nsaid,  \"Let's  go  get  'ern,  boys.\"  Then  officers  carne  \"from \nmost  everywhere.\"  They  started swinging  their clubs. \nI  did not  see  anyone  keep  Negroes  out of  the  theater. \n1  did not  see  any  rough  crowd  of whitesgo  into  the  theater. \nI  saw  police  cars  go  back and  forth.  A county  car parked \nright  in  front  of  the  barber  shop  tvhen  the  crowd  got big. \nA \"dozen  or two  dozen\"  officers were  there.

I  was  home  on \nJuly 4,  1964.  I  was  asle~p and was  awakened  by  a  lot of \nnoise.  I  saw  about  ten colored people  in  the  driveway. \nI  saw white  people  in front  of  the  theater.  There were \nwhite  people  in  front of  the newsstand  also,  and  on  the \nsidewalk.  I  did not  notice  colored or white  people on \nthe  corners.  I  wen.t  outside  and  asl~ed the  group  to  leave \nmy  driveway.  I  closed the  gate  and  locked  it.  Some  of \nthe group went  toward  the  theater and  some  stood  in  front \nof my  house.  I  went  on  my  porch.  Hy  yard  is  fenced  in \nall around.  I  didn't notice  any  particular Negro  going \nback and  forth.  I  heard  some  obscene  language.  I  saw \nSheriff Clark. arrive  and  park across  the  street.  I  did  ยทยท \nnot  see  any  Negro  walk out  to  Sheriff Clark.  I  saw  Sheriff \nClark get out  of his  car.  He  walked  across  the  street and \ntried to  get  them  to  move  on,  both white  and  colored.  He \ndid  disperse  both white  and  Negroes.

Between  July 2  and  July 6, \nI  noticed a  lot of  out-of-town vehicles  in Selma.  I  saw \nvehic::les  from  county  numbers  14,  16,  48,  58,  and 1,  as \nwell  as  a  good  many  out-of~state cars.  County  #14  is \nChilton,  County  #1  is Jefferson,  County  #58  is Shelby, \nCounty  #2  is Nobile;  there were  some  Nobile  cars.  I  don't \nremember  when  I  first went  to  the  \\\\iilby  Theater,  but  I  went \nin response  to  a  call.  I  saw  several  \"rough-looking white \nmen  hanging  around,\"  several Negroes  also.  There were \nseveral whites  in front  of  Carter 1 s  and \\ยทJoolworth' s  and \nseveral on cars.  They  were  sitting on  the  :Benders  of  the \nparked cars.  There  were  several Negroes  by  the  Silver Noon \nCafen  I  dispersed  the  three rough-looking whites,  but \ndid not  disperse  the Negroes.  Then  I  left; before  I  left, \nI  sawยท  Negroes  to-into  the  theatre.  I  came  baclc.  about \nthir1:y  to  thirty-fi~e minutes  later. \nr~. Butler stopped me  and  told me  there was  an \nincident  across  the  street.  He  said he  thought  a  white \nperson had  tried to  jump  a  colored boy.  I  went  back  to \npatrolling.  I  heard on  the radio  that there  appeared  to \nbe  a  fight  in the  making.  I  went  as  fast  as  I  could.  I \nsaw  Sheriff  Clark  and  another man  walk  across  the  street. \nThere  was  a  gang  of whites  and  a  gang  of  colored.  They \nwere  jeering at each other and facing  each other.  Another \npoliceman  and  I  moved  the whites  first,  then we  went  baek \nand  \"assisted the  sheriff move  the  colored people.\"  In \nvestigator Head was  with  Clark. \nI  saw no  Negroes  abused.  I  saw  James  Clark strike \nno  Negro. \nI  was  in Car  100  on  July 4.  At  6:0~ six officers \nwent with me  to  the  'l;'fi.lby  Theater  on  complaint  of Roger \nButler.  The  officers were  Foster,  Jones,  Burroughs, \nSteinwinder,  Kilgore,  and  Brunson.  I  do  not  recall making \nany  arrests. \n.  That  night,  I  heard  a  call about  an  incident  at \nClay's  Casino.  Someone  had  thrown  an  object  through  the \nwinds:hield  of  the  Carson's  car.โข. .  tfuen  I  arrived,  the  Hegroes \nwere  doing nothing  but milling  around.  That  is  a  colored \narea,  but  there  is a  white  area  just north..  To  get home \nfrom downtown,  a  white would have  to  go  through  the  colored \nsection. \nOn  July  5,  I  was  patrolling near  the A.N.E.  Hall on \nLawrence,  Sylvan,  Jeff Davis,  and Green Streets.  I  was  in \nCar  11.  Officer  Ellison was  with me.  We  traveled north \nC-10 \n\non  Lawrence  Street.  As  we  passed  the  end  of  one  of  the -\napartment buildings,  there was  a  loud racket,  as  if some \nthing hit the  car or  as  if the  car had  snapped  a  stick.  He \nstopped  and  got  out  of  the  car.  Behind  the  car,  in its \ntrack,  was  a  small  coke  bottle.  I  picked  it up.  Then \nwe  went  up  the  street,  turned  around  and  drove  back,  going \nsouth on  Lawrence.  As  we  got  to the  same  place,  another \nCoca  Cola bottle hf!t  the  car.  He  stopped  and got out.  rvJe \nsaw  two  young  Negro  men.  I  yelled,  \"Stop.\"  He  each  chased \none  of  the  Negroes.  I  finally fired  a  shot.

Butler  said let them in.  He  sold them \nthe  tickets. \nThen  I  went  to  the  Silver Noon  Cafe  on  the  corner \nof  Selma  and  Franklin.  There  I  saw  Johnny  Jones  and  talked \nwith him for  about  fifteen to  twenty minutes.

I  heard one  Negro \ncurse,  \"Get  those white  SOB's  out  of here.\"  The  sheriff \ndispersed everyone,  both white  and  colored.  I  soon left \nthe  area.  \\ยทJhile  I  was  at  the  corner  a  Negro  picked up  a \nrock.

I  work  at  the \nCloverleaf  Daires. \nI  was  with my  wife  and  two  granddaughters  going \nnorth  on Broad  Street.  By  the l;Jil by  Theater,  I  saw \na  bunch  of  \"nigger teen-agers,\"  half way  out  in the \nstreet.  There  were  whites  on Carter's corner.  An \n\"agitator\"  in a  red  shirt,  a  \"nigger,\"  said,  ''Let's \nget  the  white  son-of-a-bitches.\"  I  saw  a  sheriff's car \nwith  the  sheriff and  four  deputies.  \"He  dispersed both \nthe  niggers  and  the  whites.''  I  saw  some  rocks,  three \nor four knives,  and  a  bicycle  chain  in the  hands  of the \n\"niggers.\"  I'd say,  in my  opinion,  in not  more  than  five \nminutes  there  might  have  been  a  riot. \nI  stayed  there  forty-five  minutes.  I  saw  no  policemen \nthere  at  all.  I'm sure  of  that.  I  saw  some  \"niggers\" \ncome  out  of  the  theater.  I  saw  no  arrests made.  I  didn't \nsee Charlie Jones,  the  policeman. \nYes,  I  signed  an  affidavit. \nC-12 \n\nCHARLIE  JONES \n(vJhite) \nI've been with  the Selma Police  two  years  and  two \nmonths. \nFrom  July  2  to  July 8,  I  worked  fourteen  to  sixteen \nhour  shifts on  Record  control. \nI  live next  door  to  the  theater.  I  noticed  an un \nusual  amount  of cars  from  Shelton,  Mobile,  Shelby,  and \nChilton Counties.  There  were  also out-of-state  cars. \nI  was  just arriving home  when  the  trouble  broke  out. \nI  drove  up  when  the  trouble  started.  I  saw  a  Negro  talk \ning  to Clark.  He  turned away  and  said,  ''Let's  go  get  'em.\" \nI  helped  the  sheriff,  Goodwin,  and  others.  He  dispersed \nboth  the  whites  and  the  Negroes.  I  did  not  observe  any \ndistinction in treatment  of  the  whites  and  Negroes.  I \ndid not  see  any white  crowd.  I  did not  see  the  Negroes \ncome  out.  I  did not  see  Sheriff Clark  return. \nC-13 \n\nJ.Al-1ES  CHENS \n(Negro) \nI  have  a  B.s.  degree,  an H.S.,  and  am  a  doctor of \nliterature.  I '.ve  attended  school  at the University of \nNichigan,  the  University of  Chicago,  and  at Louisiana \nState University. \nI've been  President of  Selma University  for eight \nand  one  half years.  Benny  Tucker was  \"never expelled\" \nfrom Selma University.  Instead,  Tucker was  dropped  in \nJuly oยฃ.1963  for poor  scholastic standing. \nI  am  not  aware  of any  degree  in Theology  that Tucker \never obtained. \nSelma University has  approximately  220  students.  In \nthe  fall of 1963,  twenty-three of  them,  all Negroes,  were \narrested.  I  had no  personal knowledge  of why  the  students \nwere  arrested,  but  they  had  told me  it was  for  demonstrat \ning.  Because  of  a  rule  at Selma University  that  a  student \nwho  misses  more  than  twenty  percent of  the  sessions  in a \ncourse  is dropped  from  that  course,  parents  of the  arrested \nstudents  urged me  to  arrange  for  their return  to  school. \nThereupon,  I  contacted Judge  Hare.  I  do  not know  whether \nthe  cases  were  in  Judge ยทNallory's  court.  Judge  Hare  gave \nhis  full  cooperation.  I  asked  the  students whether  they \nwould  rather demonstrate  or go  to  school.  A.  c. 'Pilliams \nand  Emmett  Anderson  said  they  preferred  to  continue  their \ndemonstrations.  Judge  Hare  arranged  for the  release  of all \nthe  students but  those  two.  He  gave  the  students  an \n\"ordinary lecture\",  proscribing  \"all demonstrations\".  The \nstudents  had  been  in  jail about  a  week.  On  June  16,  1964, \nHare  contacted me  about  the  students.  I  recommended  the \ncharges  be  dropped  and  I  never heard  another word  about \nit. \nC-14 \n\nJAMES  FOSTER \n(White) \nI  am  a  traffic officer with the  Selma Police. \nOn  July 4,  I  was  on duty  from 8  a.m.  to  9  or 10  p.m.  My \nduty was  routine  patrol,  watching  four  groups  that might \ncause  trouble.  I  patrolled the  entire downtown  area.  I \nwas  on  a  motorcycle  that day,  with call numbers  77  and \n99.  I  noticed a  crowd  gathering  at the  Wilby  theatre \nand went  over  there.  I  was  not dispatched,  but  just saw \na  possible problem and went  over  to  the  theatre.  A car \nhad come.  Sgt.  Goodwin  and  Officer  Jones  were  there. \nSheriff  Clark had  come  at about  the  same  time.  He  had \njust got  out of his  car when  \"we\"  rode  up.  :I  saw no \npossemen  at the  theatre  until  the  trouble  arose.  After \nthe  police dispersed a  crowd  of  b~elve to  fifteen whites, \nwe  went  down  to help Sheriff  Clark disperse  the Negroes. \nI  recognized Alvery Williams,  whom  I  saw  talking  to \nSheriff  Clark.  I  recognized no  other Negroes  or whites, \nalthough  I  have Tived in Selma fifteen years.  There \nwere  several out-of-county license  plates  in town  that day. \nSmall groups  had gathered in different parts  of  town.  I \nstayed in the  area of  the  ~~lby Theatre for  about  twenty \nminutes  after the  e~owd had been dispersed.  I  did not see \nwhites gยทo  into the  theatre or  Negroes  come  out.  I  did not \nknow  there were  Negroes  in the  theatre,  although  I  had \nseen one  at  the box  office previously used  only by whites. \nI  knew  the civil rights  act had passed and  that it applied \nto  the  Wilby.  I  knew  the Wilby had been  segregated before. \nA patrol car received a_call concerning  a  bottle \nthrown  through~the windshield  and  resulting injuries.  I \nwent  to  the  area of  Clay's  Casino  and  the Roxy  Theatre; \nthat is predominatly Negro  section of  town.  The  police \ndispersed the  crowd  of  Negroes  and  a  crowd  of whites. \nAfter  they had cleared the  crowds,  the  police directed \ntraffic.  I  don't remember  whether  I  saw  any  possemen  at \nClay's  Casino.  Later,  the  police investigated the rock \nthrowing  incident. \nPatrolling on a  motorcycle,  I  was  in the vicinity \nof  the  o.w.c.  homes  the e~ening of  July  s.  My  call number \nwas  77  or 99.  MY  location was  approximately  a  block be\" \nhind  the A.M.E.  Hall.  A call came  over  the radio from \nthe desk,  stating that Sgt.  Goodwin's  car had been hit.  I \nwas  ordered out of  the  area,  because  I  lacked  protection \non my  motorcycle.  I  went  to  the corner  of  Selma  and Green, \nparked my  motorcycle,  and directed traffic.  Traffic was \nheavy  in the  area,  so  I  kept cars from going north  on \nGreen  Street.  I  was  not  in the  area of  the Hall  itself. \nC-15 \n\nI  was  in car 11  after 6  p.m.  on  July 6,  patrolling \nwith Lt. Knight.  We  went  to  the Mt.  Ararat Baptist Church, \nwhich  is on Mechanic  Street by Medley Avenue.  Our  pur \npose  was  \"to  patrol  the  area and keep  the  peace.\"  I  do \nnot know  who  the  speaker  is.  After  the meeting was  ad \njourned,  patrol cars were  standing by.  Most  of  the  crowd \nhad  left.  I  observed  that  two  rocks  were  thrown.  One \ncame  across  a  house  near  the  policemen.  Another was  down \nthe  road.  We  stayed in the  area until  the  crowds  had  left. \n\nARTHUR  ATCHISON \n(~-bite) \nI  work  at the Hendrick  Tractor  I  have \nCd~pany. \nbeen  a  member  of  the mounted  posse  for  four  br  fi~e years. \nSheriff  Clark  said the  purpose  of  the  mounted  posse  was \nto  assist the sheriff's department  in maintalnitig iaY1  and \norder,  to  protect whites  and  Negroes.  My  duties have  inw \neluded rescue work  and emergencies,  such  as  the  flood  of \n1961.  There  are  thirty-five members  in the mounted  posse. \nNcLeod  was  once  at  a  meeting.  He  did not  state,  \"We  must \nmeet  force with force.\"  No  members  of  the  posse  are \nNegroes.  I  went  to l:1ontgomery  once  on  standby. \nOn  July 4,  I  was  in a  county car.  There  could have \nbeen  three  or four  other  possemen  around.  I  was  in a  car \nwith Deputy Bates.  v.:e  got  a  radio call to come  to  the \nvJilby.  I  was  in Car  D4,  DS,  or  D6. \nI  arrived at the A.M.E.  Hall  at about  7  o'clock. \nI  arrived in a  county car with deputies  Hright  and Blair. \nThe  meeting had not started when  I  arrived.  Three hundred \nto  350  Negroes  were  on hand.  There were  about  a  hundred \ndeputies  present,  more  or less.  I  heard clapping  and \nsinging,  including  \"vJe  ,.,Jill  Overcome.\"  The  Negroes  stayed \nin about  two  hours.  They  started out,  someone  said  \"Every \nbody  back  in the  church.\"  There was  a  huge  crowd  outside \nin addition to  those  inside.  One  Negro  outside was  talking \nloud,  and  he  said he \"t-1as  in the Army  and  had  a  gun and  he \nwould  get it and be  equal  to  those  across  the  street.  He \ncame  out  about  a  half hour  later.  He  was  almost  across  the \nstreet.  They  were  clapping  and  singing  and hollering. \nThey  began  to  stand around,  talking.  I  saw  two  white men \ncome  out. \nRocks  were  thrown from across  the  street.  They  were \nthrown  at two  intervals.  I  heard  a  shot  about  the  time  of \nthe  first group  of rocks,  then a  barrage.  A white  man \nstepped  toward  the  Jeff  Davis  side  of  the  church.  He  got \norders  to  step in and  break it up,  after  the  second barrage \nof roclts.  The  Negroes  ran all over,  I  lost  track of  the \nwhite  men. \nvยท7e  came  across  them again.  One  was  lying  on  the \nground,  and  the  other was  sitting around.  Only  the  deputies \nwere  near  them when  I  arrived. \nI  did not  strike or kick  the  photographers  and  I  did \nnot see  any  other sheriffโขs  people  do  so.  They walked  off, \nand  I  did not  see  them again.  There was  blood on  them.  I \nsaid nothing  to  them.  No  one  offered them medical  assistance. \nI  did not  stril<:e  or abuse  any  Negroes.  I  did not \nsee  others  do  so.  F/e  patrolled the  area.  lJe  did not  go \nto  any  Negro  houses.  I  cruised the area in a  county  car. \nC-16 \n\nOn  July  6,  1  parked  on  the  Hedley  Street in front \nof  the church door,  with Deputies  v~ight and  Blair. \nThere were  a  couple  of bricks  thrown  that night.  One  hit \nthe  bumper  and  one  hit the  fender  of  the  county  car near \nwhich  1  was  standing by.  1  have  attended  other meetings \nand  these  procedures  are  not  unusual.  I  have  run whites \noff from  the  Tabernacle  and from  the  church  on  Jeff  Davis \nwhile meetings  were  in session. \nC-16-b \n\nJOHN  WARREN \n(vJh.ite) \nI  operate  the Thirsty Boy  drive-in restaurant. \nIt's in Selma,  behind Sears,  south  of  the  bank.  On  July \n4,  at about  3:00p.m.,  four  Negroes  drove  onto  the  parking \nlot of  the Thirsty Boy.  I  asked  them  to  leave because \nthey were  trespassing.  They  left,  and  I  called the  sheriff \nand  asked him to come.  While  previously  I  had  always -\ncalled the  police when  trouble  arose,  Mr.  Pitts had in\" \nstructed me  that if any  trouble  arose  on  July 4,  I  should \ncall the sheriff. \nThe  Negroes  parked  across  the  street and  immediately \ncame  inside  the  Thirsty Boy.  I  asked  them to  leave,  in a \nlow  tone  of voice  and mostly by motion.  There  were  several \npeople  in the  restaurant. \nAt  that time  there were  disturbances  in downtown \nSelma.  I  recognized  the  whites,  but  I  couldn't identify \nthem now. \nThe  sheriff came  in and deputy Hewston handed me  the \nwarrants.  I  signed  the  warrants,  and  the  sheriff removed \nthe  Negroes.  I  did not  see  the  sheriff abuse  them.  The \nsheriff was  there when  Hewston handed me  the warrants.  I \ndidn't know  the  names  of  the  Negroes. \nI  believe  that if the  sheriff had not removed  the \nNegroes  there would  have  been trouble.  That's  why  I  called \nthe  sheriff. \nc-.17 \n\nDR.  RUSSELL \n(V.lhite) \nI've been  in Selma  two  and  a  half years.  I  attend \ned  the  University of Alabama School  of  Dentistry. \nI  treated Roberta Corson.  The  pictures  [Def.  Ex. \nNos.  8  and  9]  look  to me  as  if they were  taken a  few  days \nafter the  accident.  I  was  called by  Dr.  George  Nicholson. \nI  examined Roberta Corson at  the  hospital.  The  injuries \nwere  more  serious  than the  pictures  show. \nC-18 \n\nJ. E.  HEv1STON \n(vJhite) \nI  am  a  Dallas  County  deputy  sheriff.  I've been \nwith  the  Department  five  years  last February. \nOn  July 4,  1964  I  came  on  duty  as  a  patrol deputy \nat  8:00  a.m.  I  received  a  radio  call to  go  to  the \nThirsty Boy.  Sheriff  Clark and  Deputy  Bates  were with \nme  there.  He  went  inside.  I  had warrants which  I  l-ras \ngiven  to  carry with me.  This  is  common  practice.  Some \nof  the  warrants  are  partially filled  in earlier in  the \nday.  The  notary  signature  is not stamped  in  ahead of \ntime.  The  warrant  for  trespass  [in  Pl.  Ex.  No.  4]  is \nfilled out  in my  handwriting.  I  don't know  when  the \ncharge  was  typed  in. \nHhen  I  went  into  the Thirsty Boy  I  talked with \n'Harren,  who  said that  there were  people  there he  would \nlike to  remove.  I  told him he would have  to  sign  the \nwarrants.  I  gave  them  to  him  and he  signed  them.  I  did \nnot know  the  names  of  the  Negroes  at the  time. \nThey  were  sitting in  the middle  of the  restaurant. \nThere were  four  of  them.  I  helped  to  arrest  them.  I  did \nnot  use  a  cattle prod  and  did not notice  any.  I  don't \nrecall  their objecting  to  being  arrested.  They were  put \nin my  car.  I  didn 't see  them  abused.  I  didn 't see a  Negro \ntna-le- kick Clark.  He  took them  to  the  county  jail. \nDeputy Bates,  two  special deputies,  and  I  arrived  at \nGreen  Street about  7:30.  Negroes  had  just begun  to  arrive. \nDuring  the meeting  there were  about  seventy-five Negroes \noutside  the  hall and  about  200  inside.  I  was  stationed in \nfront  of  the  church on  the  same  side  of  the  street, \n~-rentyยญ\nfive  or thirty feet  from  the  door.  Hhen  the  Negroes  came \nout,  they  separated,  some  going  north  and  some  going  south. \nI  saw  a  group of Negroes  behind  a  hedge.  Rocks  were  thrown, \nbut  I  could not  apprehend  anyone.  I  saw  two  white men  come \nout of  church before  the  rest of  the  people  and  set up \ncameras  to  take  pictures of  the  crowd  coming  out.  After \nthe  confusion  started I  didn't see  them  any more. \nI  did not hit any  Negro  or fire  any weapon,  nor  did \nI  see  any  officer abuse  a  Negro. \nC-19 \n\nGED'RGE  B.  NICHOLSON \n(Hhite) \nI've been  in Selma  ten  and  a  half years.  I  am \nan N.D. \nI  treated Roberta  Corson  on  July 4,  1964,  according \nto  my  records,  at about  10:00  p.m.  She  had  lacerations \nabout her lip with a  piece of glass.  I  removed  the \nglass  and  cal1ed Dr.  Donald Russell  to  treat the  damage \nto  her  teeth.  Her  lips were more  swollen  than  the  pictures \n[Def.  E,c.  Nos.  9A  and  9B)  show.  She  had no  other injuries \nthat I  know  of. \nThat  same  night  I  saw George Hichael  Corson.  Accord \ning  to  the  records,  he  had  lacerations  of  the  n.eck and \nright  arm.  No  glass.  He's  in the  pictures  [Def.  Ex. \nNos.  9C  and  9D];  90  shows  a  neck suture. \nThe  same  night,  James  Virgil  Jones  had  lacerations  of \nboth arms.  They were  superficial.  I  cleaned  and  dressed \nthem.  That  [Def.  Ex.  No.  9E]  is  a  picture of Jones. \nC-20 \n\nGEORGE  ~~1.  CORSON \n(Hhite) \n.

I \ngot  to  the  curb  and three white men  grabbed me  and \nheld me.  I  was  hurt in the  neck  and  the  arm. \nThere  were more  th~n 40  in the  group  of Negroes \nby  the  Casino. \nC-23 \n\nROBERTA  00 RSON \n(White) \n.Qn  .}'uly  Mother saw  a  bunch C?f  colored \n4,.~ 196~, \npeople  beside  Clay's Casino.

I  was  detailed over \nhere  on  the  ''trouble  they were  having\"  at that time. \nI  riding with Capt. Hoore  all day.  There was  an \n~1as \nincident  shortly after noon on July 4th.  A man,  driving \na  car with Mississippi  license plates,  had  just been in \nthe Selma  Del  and  said a  waitress  had  asked him  to report \nthat a  blond-headed man  with a  camera was  in there with \na  pistol.  I  reported to  the sheriff's office by  radio, \nand  they  immediately dispatched someone.  The  radio  log \nshows  that on July  5,  atยท 7:52  p.m.,  345  (me)  radioed  the \nstation to phone  the city police about  a  cottonhead photo \ngrapher with a  gun. \nI  stayed in Selma  several days.  I  did not  stay in \nSelma  the night of  the  5th.  I  heard about  it on  the \nsheriff's network. \nc-2s \n\nQHARLIE  A1'1HONS \n(White) \nNy  wife  and  I  were  driving down  Lapsley Street \nwhen  our  auto was  struck by  an  object.

It broke  the back glass \nand  hit the  trunl(.  There were  just a  few  scratches. \nWe  didn't see who  threw  the object,  but we  did see \nNegroes  in the  cafe.  I  went  into  Police Headquarters \nand  reported  the  incident. \nC-27 \n\nJOHN  A.  BEVERLY \n(Hhite) \nI  have  lived for  thirty-five years  in Dallas County.  I \nhave  been a  posse member  since Clark came  into  office.  I \nam  a  special deputy  (part-time deputy).  I  have  attended a \nNational  State's Rights  Part meeting.  Six men  in \nClark~s \ngroup were  outside.  Fifteen or  twenty  attended.  I  didn't \nhear what  was  said. \nI  don't l'now  how  many  special deputies  or  possemen \nthere are.  I  went  to Tuscaloosa with  the sheriff.  That \nwas  on  the  date  that  the  University of Alabama was  integrated. \nI  did not  go  to Notasulga.  I  went  to Birmingham when  there \nwas  racial difficulty.  I  never left the  county  for  the  sheriff \nexcept  on racial  cases.  All of Sheriff Clark's  people  are \nwhite. \nI  went  to  the M1E  Hall July 5.  I  have  observed other \nNegro  meetings.  The  sheriff did not  treat  the Negro  meetings \ndifferent  than the NSRP  meeting.  I  arrived about  7:30 in a \ncar,  D-5,  with Deputy  Leo  Nichols.  ''Niggers\" were milling \naround  outside  in a  group  of about  fifteen to  twenty.  I \nstayed until  the  meeting broke up  at  about  9:30 โข . ยท \"l!e  Shall \nOvercome\" was  sung.  They were  singing,  slapping  their hands, \njumping  up  and  dot~, and marching  around.  No  one  Negro  caught \nmy  eye.  I  heard one  Negro  say he  could get his  gun and  could \nhandle  all of us  sons  of  a  bitches.  I  sau two  white men  coming \nout  of  the ยทchurch;  the  light went  off.  I  heard them say  \"Let's \nget  โขem.\"  r.ocks  or  stones  a  whole  barrage  of them,  were  throtm. \nI  heard one  shot.  Crocleer  gave  the orders  to move  in and  \"bust \nthem up.\"  I  next  saw  the  two  white men  laying  on  the ground. \nNegroes  were  between the  sheriff's men  and  the  posse.  The \ncrowd was  dispersed.  I  did not  see anyone  strike the reporters. \nI  did not  see  the  posse  abuse  or kick  the  reporters.  I  did not \nsee  the Negroes  abused.  Crocl,er  said to  find  out  if they need \nmedical  aid.  I  saw McLeod,  but did not  see him hit anyone, \nand  did not hear him give  anyone  any  instructions.  Clark came \nup  after all this  occured.  Clark ordered the officers  to  ask \npeople  to  go  into houses  and stay there  for  their own \nprotect~ \nion.  I  did not  see  lights  on Negro  houses  knocked out.  I  did \nnot  see deputies  break any  cameras. \nThere was  another meeting on July 6.  Abernathy spoke. \nI  went with Deputy Hright  and Blair.  The  meeting was  in East \nSelma on Hechanic Street.  The  car in which  I  was  riding was \nhit by a  rock.  Actually it was  a  bricle.  This was  the  only \nincident of rock throwing  that I  know  of. \nGildersleeve  told Sheriff Clarke  that he was  proud  that \nthe  sheriff was  there  to keep  law  and  order that  night. \nI  have  no  idea how  many  officers were  present. \nC-28 \n\nGEORGE  KING \n(l-Jhite) \nI  went  to  the Post  Office and  eturning home. \n~1as l .. \nAs  I  approached  near  the  intersection of Lapsley and  Small \nand  someone  shouted,  \"Hey,  white  folks,  stop .. \"  I  first \nstarted  to  stop  and  then decided against  it and  as  I  sped \naway  someone  shouted an obscene remark at me.  I  then reยท \nturned dot-mtown  and  reported  the incident to  police,  furnishing \nthe  identity of  the Negro  I  thought  made  the remarl(.s.  He \nwas  wearing a  red pullover  sports  shirt.  Later  I  identi-\nfied  the Negro,  and he was  convicted  in-Recorders  Court  and \nfined  t-wenty-five dollars. \nC-29 \n\n. \n.. \nFRANK  BARR \n(White) \nOn  July  6,  1964,  I  went  to  Lapsley Street with the \ndescription of  a  Negro  male who  was  wanted  for  throwing a  rock \nat Mr.  King.  King  identified the Negro,  who  had  a  golf \nball and  a  rock in his  pocket.  I  recollect  that  the young man ยท.โข  \" \nwas  cursing and hurling rocks.  I  do  not  know  if the Negro \nwas  tried.  I  had  a  warrant  somewhere.  It is a  custom of  the \nPolice Department  that when  an officer has  a  description he \ntakes  a  person  into custody  and  gets  a  warrant  later. \n\nZEKE  STEINVnNDER \n(ltlhite) \nI  investigated an incident  near  the Savoy Cafe with \nanother  Selma  police officer,  Frank  Barr.  I  \"1as  dispatched \nto the  scene  between  9  and  9:30  p.m.  I  had a  description \nof a  Negro  male,  tall,  teenage,  dark trousers,  white  tennis \nshoes. \nIn a  case where  there is a  complaint  and  a  likelihood \nthat  the  offender will flee,  it is not  the  policy to  arrest \nwithout  a  warrant. \nC-31 \n\nJOHN  CROSS \n(White) \nI'm a  used  auto  parts  man  from  Selma.

I  have  a  list of \noccasions when  the posse has  been called out,  but  I  forget \nsome  things  and notยท everything gets  on the  list.  The  water \nposse was  called out on July  6  to  investigate a  body .in the \nSoapstone Creek.  They  recovered a  Negro  who  was  from \nPensacola,  Florida.  The  posse has  two  underwater men.  They \nwere  called to  pull a  truck out of  the Alabama  river.  That's \nthe by-laws  of  the  Dallas  County  Sheriff's posse  [Def. \nEx.  No.  7].  I  went  to  Birmingham with the posse.  I  rode  to \nTuscaloosa  the day before Nalone entered the University,  but \nI  was  not needed. \nDallas  County  and  the city of  Selma both purchase equi' p-\nment  for  the posse.  The  boats  are privately owned, \nfor equipment  that  the  city recently purchased.  ~ccept \nThe  list of possemen has  all of  them,  not  just the \nwater posse.

The  church lights were  on,  and  a \nfew Negroes  started singing and  clapping;  the crowd  grew. \nI  stood near the  car. \nHy  attention was  atrracted by one Negro  l<7ho  was  talk \ning crazy.  He  said he could whip  them all and  that he was \ngoing home  to  get his pistol.  \"He  ignored him.\"  I  heard \nsomeone  inside say that now  The  Civil Rights Act  has  passed \nwe  don't have  to rape white women,  \"and  I'm going out  and \nget me  a  white woman  and have rae  a  white child.\"  I'm posi \ntive I  heard that;  I  was  standing by a  tree at the front  of \nthe hall. \nI  saw  two  photographers,  one with a  camera  and one with \nlights.  The  lights were  set up  to shine at the church. \nThey were  on. \nC-33 \n\nThe  meeting disbanded!  and  some  went  off.  Some  ~1ent \nback into  the hall.  The  l1ght went  out and  I  heard  a  gun \n1 \ngo  off.  Then  there was  a  barrage of  br1cks  hitting metal. \nThen  I  think the  tear gas  was  used.  Crocker  gave  orders  to \nbreak it up.  It wasn't much  trouble since all of  them  ran. \nAt  the front  of  the hall,  by  a  bush or hedge  [shown  in \nDef.  Ex.  No.  SC],  I  stumbled on  a  't>Thite  man.  I  wยทas  corning \nfrom  the  rear of  the hallo  I  saw  one  sitting and  one  lying \non  the  ground.  Head  came  up  and  identified himself.  He \nasked  the white  on  the  ground what  happened,  but  I  didn't \nhear  the  reply.  Someone  said,  we'd better get  them  to  a \ndoctor.  I  left after that.  I'd had  orders  to clear the \nstreet and did.  I  saw  posseman beat  or abuse  a  Negro. \nC-33-b \n\nJOHN  GRIMES \n(v1hite) \n1  was  not  at  the  A.H.E.  Hall on  the  5th.

I \nwas  at the  Hall  about  8  or 9  o'clock.  At  the  Hal1,  I \nwas  instructed by  Crocker  to  line up opposite  the Hall \nand  not  to  move  until  instructed to  do  so.  Stoves  and \nHead  went  into  the meeting.  After  the  meeting broke  up, \nbricks were  thrown  at the  car,  and  they did not move. \nI  did not hear  a  shot.  I  was  told  to  move  when  a  number \nof bricks were  thrown  again.  I  two  white men  come \nsa~1 \nout;  they  had  a  camera with  them.  The  whites were  among \nthe  Negroes  in front of  the  Church.  I  moved  into  the \narea to  disperse  the  crowd.  I  went  to  the  right of  the \nChurch  and  on  returning saw  the  two  photographers  on  the \nground.  I  saw  the Deputies  pick them up,  not  abuse  them. \nI  did not hit a  Negro  or see others  strike them.  I  had \nto  back up when  gas  was  used,  and  could not get close \nenough  to  strike them.  I  saw  Sheriff Clark there,  but  I \ndid not see  Clark  talking to  the newsmen.  I  saw McLeod \nthere,  but  did not  see HcLeod  talking  to  the newsmen. \nAfter the  crowd  dispersed,  I  was  instructed by  Clark \nand  Crocker  to  disperse  the  crowd  and see  that everyone \nwent home. \nI'm a  member,  but not  an  officer of  the White \nCitizens  Council.

The \ncity has  no  discriminatory  policy of  law  enforcement. \nIt has  forty-one  officers on  its police  force.  V.Jilson \nBaker,- the  director of  public  safety,  has  eighty  to \neighty-two  men  under  him.  The  city authorized  the \nfiling of  the  injunctions  suit because  the  situation \nwas  tense. \nAt various  times,  I  did  talk to  Sheriff Clark. \n11y  understanding was  that  the  Police  Department would \ncarry out all  of the  City of Selma. \nla~1s \nC-38 \n\nNOEL  TOWNS \n(White) \nItwork  for Transcontinental Gas  Pipe  Lines. \nI've  lived in  Dallas  County  twelve  years. \nI've been  a  member  of  the  water posse  since 1961. \nI'm  in  rescue  operations.  I  worked  in a  big  flood, \nworked  on  several drownings,  and  picked up  lost boats. \nI  arrived at the  A.H.E.  Hall  at 6:30  p.m.  on  July  5 \n[6]  with deputies  Hewston  and Bates.  I  saw  Rufus  Head \nand Deputy  Stoves  inside.  I  stood  in the  street right \nin  front  of the  church by  the  big oak  tree with Hewston \nand  Bates.  I  think there  is  a  curb  there.  About  200-250 \npeople were  inside.  They  came  out  about  9:30 or 10:00 \nand  then  some  went  back  in  the  church.  They  sang  a  song \nand  then  came  out with  two  white men,  one  of whom  had  a \ncamera.  The  Negroes  went  to  the  left,  toward  Selma \nAvenue  (south).  Then  a  dozen  or more  rocks  were  thrown \nand  Crocker ordered the  posse  to  disperse  the  Negroes. \nI  did not hit any  Negroes  or see  any  officer strike a \nNegro.  I  saw  the  two  white men  later on the  Jeff Davis \nside of  the  church.  One  was  on  the  corner and one  was \nsitting up.  I  did not  talk to  them.  There  were some \nmen  I  don't know  if they were  in  the  posse. \nther~but \nThen  the  two  white men  went  to  a  car. \nC-39 \n\nWILH&Mi SU'tl-1ER \n(T.-Jhite) \n11m  a  lifetime  resident of Dallas County.

I  stayed across  from  the  Hilby  an  hour  and  a  half \nor two  hours,  then  I  went .back  to  the  courthouse.  I \njust sat  in  the  car and  I  saw  a  large  crowd of \nobserved~ \nwhites  across  from  the Hilby,  and some  Negroes  The \no \nwhites  dispersed.  Some  Negroes  went  insidev  and  some  went \ndown  the  street.  I  saw  other possemen  there.  I  don't \nknow  which branch.  I  don't know  how  many  were  called to \nduty.  Hy  instructions  didn't  include  an  order on where \nto  go.  I  went  to  the  Theater and  dispersed  a \n~Talton \ncrowd  there. \nI  was  directly across  the  street from  the  church on \nJuly  So  Around  250  to  300  Negroes  were  there.  I  arrived \nabout  7  Perno  with a  deputyo  I  saw  people  go  inside  and \nstartยท singing  and  clapping.  '!bey  came  out around  two  hours \nlater,  and  then  two  white  males  came  out and  took pictures. \nThe  Negroes  laughed when  a  Negro  said he  could  kill  us \nall.  Then  went back  insideยข  A brick hit my  car. \nth~y \nAnd  then  a  large  amount  of  objects  were  being  thrown .. \nDeputy  Crocker gave  the  order to  disperse  the  crowd.  I \nwent  to  the  church,  and  a  group of Negroes  went  down  towards \nJeff Davis.  Someone  turned  the  lights off  and  then  the \nlights  came  back on  in  the  church.  Vehicle  lights were \nturned on  in order  to  see.  I  saw  the  two  men  in front  of \na  Negro  house  on  the  north  side of  the  church on  the ground. \nI  did not  say or hear  anyone  say anything  to  the men.  I \ndid not  hear or see  any  shooting.  I  did not see  any  posse \nmen  on  the  hall side of the  street. \nI  attended  the biggest majority of  the meetings  and \nnever saw  a  Negro  hit or  at a  meeting.  I  have \n~ned \ntold whites  to  stay away.  I  do  not know  who  they were, \nprobably sightseers. \nI  was  at the  Hechanic  a-..urch meeting.  After the meet \ning was  over  I  was  standing beside  the church  and  an  object \ncame  directly behind me  and when  I  turned around  there \nwere  two  Negroes  running  down  the  street.  There was  noise \nin the  church.  There  was  singing  and  clapping  and  a \nspeaker. \nC-40 \n\nJ. T.  BLAIR \n(White) \nI've been  a  member  of  the  Sheriff's Department \nabout  two  years.

As  the \ncrowd was  dispersed,  I  heard a  loud noise  and  then  heard \na  person  holler  ''Oh,  Lord!\"  I  don't know  what  the  noise  was; \nbut.  I  did hear  itw  The  crowd was  going  down  both sides \nof  the  street.  The  chief deputy  said to  break up.  the \ncrowd.  The  ucrowd was  dispersing tihe:b.4s'e<I:Ve.so '!  I  ยท:did not \nsee  the  white men  come  out  of  the  church.but  I  did see \nthe  two  white men  in  the  alley,  between  the  house  and \nthe  church.  I  asked  them  what  had happened but they \ndidn't  answer.  I  went  to  turn my  car around  to  get some \nlights  on  them but,  they were  already  sitting up when  I \ngot back.  I  saw  them whenยท they were  walking  to  the  oar. \nI  did  not  see  any  possemen  strike a  Negro.  I  did not \nstrike  any  Negro  and  did not  see  any  posseman  strike a \nNegro. \nOn  July  6,  1964  I  was  called out to  go  to  a  meeting \nthey were  having  at the Mount  Arrarat Church.  I  did not \ngo  into  the  meeting,  I  was  on  the  outside.  Deputy \nt-lright,  Beverly,  Atchison,  and Doyle were  with me.  We \nwere  in  car DS  or D4.  I  noticed some  people who  went \nover  a  fence  and who  were  throwing  objects  across  in \nfront  of  the  church.  Then  there were  two  rooks. thrown \nin to  our car. \nC-41 \n\nWILLIAM  AVERETT \n(White) \nI 'm  thirty-ยทeight.  I've been a  deputy for three years \nand  seven monthso \nI  went  to  the  AME  hall  around  7:20 pom.  I  had  been \nto other meetings,  and  the sheriff did not do  anything \ndifferent  that night  than at other meetings.  I  was \ndriving with Crocker in a  sheriff's caro  We  parked  on \nthe west  side  of  the  church across  the  street.  The  bus \narrived after we  did,  and  it parked  on  the  south side of \nthe  church.  I  got  out  of  the  car,  and  stood  right out \nside of  the  car.  I  saw  some  Negroes  at the  churcha  They \nwere  going  in and  some  were  standing outside.  The meeting \nhad  commenced  when  I  there.  I  heard  singing,  etc.  I \n~ot \nsaw  two  white men  go  the churcho  I  had  seen  the  two \n~nto \nmen  previouslyo  I  do  not remember  seeing  them  in the \nsheriff's officeo  The  meeting  lasted about  two  hours. \nThere were  Negroes  on  the  outside all during  the meeting. \nI  saw  the white  photographers  come  out ahead  of most  of \nthe people.  When  the  crowd  had  started coming  out,  they \nturned  towards  their left (the  south side).  Then  one \nobject was  thrown and  hit the  buso  Then  another hit a \nwhite  corvairo  One  hit the right rear door  of the county \ncaro  One  hit right where  Crocker had  been.  Crocker had \nhanded me  the  tear gas  bomb  when  it appeared  there might \nbe  trouble.  He  told me  when  I  throw mine,  you  throw yours. \nAfter a  barrage  of rocks  was  thrown,  Crocker threw his \ntear gas  toward where  the rocks  came  from.  Then I  threw \nmy  tear gas.  The  Negroes  Later I  saw  two  men \ndisp.ers'e~ \ngoing  to  the  car.  I  did not hear  Blanchard McLeod  talk \nto  them.  I  did not hear anytldng.  I  did not  see any \nmember  of  the  sheriff's office or any possemen abuse  any \nNegro  that day. \nIt was  not  too  long  between the  time  the Negroes  came \nout and  the  tear gas  was  used.  A bunch  came  out  of the \nchurch.  !iCi'J11lflG  not hear the  speaker across  the street.  A \ngroup went  into the  alley,  and  I  could not  say how  many \nwere  in the  alley;  it was  darko  The  tear gas  was  given \nout before  the people  came  out of the church.  I  could not \nhear what was  said insideo  The  necessity for  tear gas \nwas  anticipated on  the  basis  of what was  going  on inside \nthe  church.  There was  hollering inside.  The  basis  for \nusing  the  tear gas was  rock  throwing. \nI  do  not know  Charles  Robertson.  I  arrested \nRobertson,  but do  not  remember  the date.  It was  at the \ncourthouse.  I  wanted  to go  into the alley to check the \nregular line.  Robertson  spit on  the  floor  towards  me,  but \nnot  on me.

'\\iJhile  we \nwere  patrolling on Lawrence  Street  at  the  George  Washington \nCarver homes,  the  car was  struck with  something.  lJe  stopped \nand  got  out  of the  car.  I  did not  see  anyone,  bltt  I  saw \na  coke  bottle on  the  ground.  Sgt.  Goodwin  picked  the  bottle \nup  and  placed  it in the  patrol car, which  I  believe was  car \nno.  2.  We  looked  around  in the vicinity of the  houses  with \nour  flashlights.  We  got back  into  the  car,  and  went  on \ndown  for  about  a  half block,  then  turned  around  and  came \nback  to  the  same  place.  Our  car was  struck again.  I  jump \ned out  of the  car  and  saw  a  boy run behind  the house.  There \nwere  two  of  them.  I  ran around  the  corner  of  the house, \nbut  the  boy  had  disappeared.  Goodwin  and  I  went  in different \ndirections.  I  turned  to  the  right  and went  in between  two \nhouses.  The  two  Negroes  were  not  apprehended.  I  heard  a \nnoise which  sounded  like  a  pistol shot.  Later Sgt.  Goodwยทin \nsaid he  had  fired  the  shot.  Sgt.  Goodwin  picked up  the \nsecond  coke  bottle,  and  we  took both bottles  to the  Selma \npolice  department.  I  don't ltnow  what  happened  to  the  bottles \nafterwards.

Before  that  I  liJ'as  a  \":velfare \n'tvorker.,  I've attended  the Yr.Jarren  Brown  School  of  .Social \nHorkers  and  several  institutes and \"t-JOrkshops.  I've \nworked  in Dallas  County  since 1950,  in the Fourth Circuit \nsince  1941.  I've been  the  probation officer for  Dallas \nCounty  since  1950.  I  work  closely with  Judge  Hare, \nSheriff  Clark,  and  Solicitor HcLeod. \nI  gathered  figures  at lienry  Pitt's request  covering \nOctober  1954  to  October  196!~ from  the  probation record of \nDallas  County  Court.  The  figures  shot,T the  number  of  persons \nby  race  put  on  probation  for various  offenses.

It was  a  random  sample. \nI  have only  heard one  criticism of  Judge  Hare,  namely \nthat  Negroes  feel  he  is entirely too  lenient ~1hen it comes \nto  sentencing for  serious  offenses  among  Negroes.  I  have \nnever  observed  prejudice. \n\nGEORGE  BAKER \n(vJhite) \n[I'm an F.B.I.  agent;  see  p.  B-27]  I  was  in Selma \nJuly 6  to 10  in my  official capacity.  I  investigated the \nregistration line procedure.  On  July 6  I  met  with Crocker \nand  Stoves,  who  explained the  system to me.  People  could \ncome  and  get  numbers.  After they  received  a  number,  they \ncould  leave  as  long  as  they were  there when  the  number  was \ncalled.  They  could  not  transfer their number,  but  could \nturn their  number  in. \nThere wa.s no formal  line outside  the  building.  People \nwere  in line inside the  building and  in informal  groups \ngathered  in the  shade  outside the  building.  I  did not  see \nthe  sheriff abuse  anyone.  The  lines were  orderly.  Both \nNegroes  and  whites  were  in the line;  there were  bunches  of \nwhites  and  bunches  of Negroes. \nOn  July  6  forty-nine  people(forty-eight Negroes,  one \nwhite)  obtained numbers.  Twenty-one Negroes  came  in.  On \nJuly  7,  three whites  and eighteen Negroes  received  numbers; \nthree whites  and  seventeen Negrยทoes  applied.  On  July  8, \nthree whites  and  ceventeen Negroes  received  numbers;  two \nwhites  and  thirteen Negroes  applied.  On  July  9,  three whites \nand  twenty-two  Negroes  received numbers;  one  white  and  fif \nteen Negroes  appliede  On  July 10,  seven whites  and  fifteen \nNegroes  received  numbers;  one  left before  the  day was  over. \nThere  were  possemen  inside  and  possemen  blocking  other \nentrances.  There were  possemen  in the  courthouse  and  in the \nalleys.  They  kept  the alley free  of disinterested  parties; \nF.B.I.,  the  sheriff,  and  newsmen  were  allowed  in the alley. \nC-47 \n\nJOSEPH  M.

B-28];  I \nwas  in Selma from  July 6  to July 23,  1964. \nThe  registration lines varied from  four  or  five  to \nfifteen  or  twenty  persons  in length.  The  line was  located \non  the west  side  of  a  paved alley.  The  entrance which  is \nused  for  people who  park in the alley was  used  for  the voter \nregistration line.  Sixty numbers  were  given out.  I  was \ntold by  Crocker  sixty was  the maximum  number  the board  could \nhandle.  I  never  saw more  than  sixty persons  try to  register. \nI  never  saw  the sheriff arrest  or beat  anyone  in the  registra. \ntion lines.  Whites  and Negroes  got  numbers  in the  same  way. \nThe  registration office is on  the  ground  floor  about \nhalf-way down  the west  side of  the hall.  The  east  side  of \nthe  hall has  windows  for  the tax collector,  the probate \nclerk,  etc.,  for  people  to transact  business.  The  west \nยทside has  no  windows,  only  offices. \nOn  July 10  thirty numbers  were  issued  (twenty-two \nwhites,  ei~ht Ne~roes); twenty-one  applications were  processed \n(twelve whJ.tes,  eight Negroes).  A total of six Negroes  were \nstill waiting โข . (Four  inside,  two  outside).  I  was  told by \nCrocker  that  sixty was  the maximum  number  the  board  could \nhandle. \nThe  total number  showing  up  that week  never exceeded \n49. \nC-48 \n\n!\"&\\NK LafORTE \n(~.fuite) \nI'm a  police  captain.  I'm  the  identification \nofficer,  in  charge  of  records  and  personnel.  I've been \nwith  the  department  nineteen  years,  eleven  in  the  same \nposition. \nThere  are  set standard fines  for  certain offenses, \nwhich  the  recorder has  authorized  the  desk  to  accept. \nRoutine  cases  are  handled  at the  desk.  Charges  and  fines \nare  the  same  for Negroes  and whites.  In  the  nineteen \nyears  that  I  have  been  with  the  police  department,  I  have \nseen  no  discrimination between  Negroes  and whites  by  the \npolice  department.  The  fine  is nineteen  dollars  for  a \ndrunk white  and  nineteen  dollars  for  a  drunk Negro. \nUnder  my  supervision,  a  chart was  prepared  [Def.  Ex. \nNo.  26]  from  the  city warrants  in  Plaintiff's Exhibit  27A. \nThe  name,  warrant  number,  charge,  race,  and  disposition \nare  shown  on  the  chart.  '!he  warrant  number  is shown  on \nthe  arrest reports.  An  entry on  the warrants  shows  the \ndisposition,  and  is  the  same  as  the  docket  entry. \nThe  thirteen  or  fourteen demonstrators  weren.' t  pro \ncessed  in  the  City  Court.  Bond  was  never refused  to  them. \nBond  was  set for  them.  The  city has  never denied bail, \nexcept  on  capital offenses  (where  the  judge  has  to  set \nbail).  On  investigative  arrests we  cooperate  with  attor \nneys.  The  man  in charge  of  the  shift has  the  power  to  set \nbail:  $100.00  for D.C.;  $200.00  for  D. . t.J.I.  or A.&  B.; \n$300.00  for  aggravated A.&B. \nThe  city desk  is open  ~~enty-four hours  a  day  with \na  radio  dispatcher,  parking  ticket  clerk,  and  a  lieu \ntenant,  sergeant,  or captain  in  charge  of  the  shift.  The \nlieutenant,  sergeant,  or captain sets bail.  All  felony \ncharges  must  go  before  the  recorder  for  preliminary hear \ning,  or preliminary  hearing must  be waived. \nThe  City .Jail  and  our office  are  on  the  second  floor \nof  the  City Building.  The  County  Jail is on  the  third \nfloor.  The  two  jails are  administered  separately  and \nbooking  is generally  separate.  When  a  person  is brought \nin  for booking,  the  desk man  takes  the  information  that \ngoes  on  the  arrest report  form.  These  serve  also  as  a \njail register.  A warrant  is made  \"after the  prisoner is \nbooked.\"  Prisoners  can  ask for  a  hearing,  make  bond,  or \nget  a  continuance.  Otherwise  the  case  is tried in recorder's \ncourt  on  the Tuesday  after the  arrest.  Every  Tuesday, \nthe bailiff picks  up  all arrest  reports  and  takes  them  to \nthe  court  at 9:00  a.m.  and  2:30  p.m. \nC-49-ยทยท \n\nvJhen  the  demonstrators were  arrested,  the Sheriff \nasked me  to  supervise  the  booking  of the  prisoners  in \nthe County  Jail.  I  took our  jailer, and  we  went  upstairs. \nt,Je  helped make  up  booking  and  fingerprint  sheets.  I \nworked  almost  solely on  fingerprinting.  Affidavits  and \nwarrants were  not made  up  at that  time.  The  jail regis \nter is made  up  at the  close  of  the  day.  The  charge, \ninterfering with court,  was  made  at the  time  of booking. \n\"1  feel sure  of  that.\"  Five  or six were  charged with \nCCW.  The  affidavits  and warrants  were  made  out by  the \nsheriff's clerk;  Crocker  signed  them,  and  Pryon's  name \n.was  stamped.  The  prisoners  were  considered city \nprisoners  because  of  the city warrants. \nOn  Tuesday,  the  bailiff picked up  the warrants  and \nput  them  on  the  desk  for  the  recorder.  The  recorder did \nnot  pick up  the  warrants.  The  recorder  continued cases; \nwe  never enter the  continuance on  the  l>Tarrant  when  there \nis  a  group  of  that many  involved.  The  charge  was  put on \nthe  city booking  sheet  (arrest report),  but  the  details \nwere  not,  because  they  could be  gotten  from  the  county \nbooking  sheet. \nI  did  not  see  the  booking  sheets  for  the  demonstrators \nexcept briefly in  the  fingerprint  room.  I  did not  take \nthe  information  for  the  booking  sheets.  Mosley  is  the \ncounty  jailer. \nThe  city  jail floor space  is much  smaller than  the \ncounty  jail โข . Last  fall,  our  jail overflowed.  This  time, \nwe  avoided  the  problem by  taking  the  prisoners  to  the \ncounty  jail. \nEach  shift officer or sergeant  has  a  name  stamp.  If \nthe  officer is  present on  shift,  his  stamp  is used on  the \nshift for warrants.  This  has  been  the  custom  for several \nyears. \nJudge  Russell  is  the  recorder.  The  prosecutor in \nthe  recorder's  court  is Archie  Reeves.  Blanchard HcLeod \nis not  connected with  the  city court.  The  court has  two \nsessions:  9:00  and  2:30.  If a  person were  arrested \nTuesday  afternoon  at 6:00,  he  could  possibly spend  a  week \nin  jail, but he  could  ask  for  a  hearing. \nC-49-b \n\nEUGENIA  GUSOORF \n(Hhite) \nI've worked  in  the  probate  office \n~.renty-four \nyears  this  January.  I've served other judges  before \nJudge  Reynolds. \nI  prepared or had  prepared Defendant's  exhibit \nnumber  27o  Most  of  the  information  on  that exhibit \nwas  taken โข'\"fยฅ6t(r:.the  juvenile  records  for  1964.  The  time \nin  jail, was  not  filled out  from  documents  in  my \npossession.  The  compilation  carries  all cases  handled \nin  1964  to  the  time  of  the  trial. \nJudge  Reynolds  handles  \"each  individual case\" \nindividually.  During  September  and October 1963,  a \ncase worker  from  the  Department  of  Pensions  and Security \nhandled each case.  Cases  are  handled now  the  same  as \nthey were  in  I  have  witnessed no  discrimination \n1941~ \nin  Judge  Reynolds'  office. \nIf there  is  a  charge  of  a  state offen.se,  there  is \na  hearing.  v7itnesses  are  called.  The  judge  hears  every \ncase.  He  never makes  a  decision without  a  hearing. \nc-so \n\nMARTHA  YA\\\\IN \n(White) \nI  am  a  deputy  sheriff;  I  do  general  office  work. \nI'm in charge  of the  radio  and  the  log  sheets.  I've \nworked  six and  a  half  years  there.  I  compiled  a  chart \nfrom  the  register of  prisoners  in the  county  jail. \n[Def.  Ex.  Noo  28]. \nC-51 \n\nCLARENCE  MeGAN \n(White) \nI'm the  deputy  clerk of  the  Dallas  County Court. \nMrs.  Hewston  is  the  clerk of  the  Circuit  Court  and  ex ... \nofficio clerk of  the  county court.  I  handle  the  criminal \nside.  Hugh  Mallory  is  the  criminal  division  judge. \nHenry Reese  is  the  solicitor. \nAll  criminal  matters  in the  county,  except  for  city \ncases,  come  before  the  county court.  There  is no  justice \nof  the  peace  for  criminal  matters. \nI  prepared  defendant's  exhibit  number  29.  ~.Je  used \nfigures  from  January,  March,  May,  July,  September,  and \nNovember  of 1964. \nI  attend  ''every\"  court  session of  the  Dallas  County \nCriminal  Court.  I  collect  fines  and  costs  and  issue \nreceipts.  \"I  have  not11  observed  any  discrimination. \nMr.  McLeod  appears  in the  court  \"practically every \nsession'';  Mr.  Reese  has  been  in poor health.  McLeod  has \nnot  dealt  differently with  Negroes  \"to my  knowledge.\" \nFines  have  been  equal  for Negroes  as  far  as  I  know. \nThe  cases  of  Floyd  t~7ilson,  James  Bennett,  Billy Bennett, \nFranklin Bennett,  James  Jones,  Richard  Tucker were  continued. \nThe  United  States  District  Court  did not  take  jurisdiction \nso  far as  I  know. \nC-52 \n\nLEE  CALAME \n(v1hite) \nI've been a  partner in the  public  accounting  firm, \nStack and Calame,  since  1958.  I  was  a  field agent  for \nthe  I.R.S.  for  seven  and  a  half years  before  that.  I \nwas  an  accountant  with Pure  Oil  in Birmingham before \nthat.  I  went  to  night  school  in Birmingham.  I've  been \nin accounting  since 1946.  I've had a  large  amount  of \nexperience  with compiling  statistics. \nI  was  employed  by Dallas  County  to compile  statis \ntics,  using defendant's  exhibits  26,  27,  28,  and  29.  I \ncompiled defendant's  exhibit  number  30,  dealing with  the \nrecord of  fines  for  the City of Selma.  It is not  fruit \nful  to compare  these  fines  statistically within a  class \nof offense,  because  there  are  degrees  of  offense;  there \nare  degrees  of wrongdoing  within an offense.  Also,  the \nfifty-nine  parking violations listed in defendant's \nexhibit  number  30  should not  really be  considered.  They \nthrow  the  totals off. \nI  prepared defendant's  exhibit number  31,  a  recapitu \nlation of  fines  in the  Dallas  County Orirnin~ Court.  It \nshows  that  the  percentage  of persons  fined  by race  is  very \nclose  to  the  percentage  of population in the  county by \nrace.  In addition the  percentage  of  fines  under  fifty \ndollars was  very close  to  the  population  figures  by  per \ncentage  by  race.  The  percentage  of white  persons  fined \nfifty dollars  and  up  in the  county criminal  court  was \nmuch  higher  than  the  percentage  of white  population in \nthe  county. \nI  prepared defendant's exhibit number  32,  which  is \na  further  analysis  of county records.  It is  similar to \ndefendant's  exhibit  number  30  except  that  it is an \nana~ysis \nof  the  criminal  docket  for  the  county,  rather than for  the \ncity. \nI  prepared defendant's  exhibit number  33,  which  con \ntains  compilations of  juvenile  court  information from \ndefendant's  exhibit number  27. \nDefendant's  exhibit  number  34,  which  I  compiled,  is \na  recapitulation of  information  from  the  register of pri \nsoners  in the  county  jail.  It is necessary to know  the \nseriousness  of  the  charge  in a  particular case  to be  able \nto  evaluate  the  statistics.  No  bonds  was  listed unless \nthey appeared  on  the  records. \nC-53 \n\nl  took the  F.B.I\"s.  report,  \"Crime,\"  [Def.  Ex.No.  35] \n~rtd calculated the  percentage  of  persons  arrested  in 1963 \nwho  were  Negroes.  That  percentage was  28.76%.  I  do  not \nknow  whether  the  Negro  population in the  United States  is \n10%.  I  calculated that  the  percentage  of  persons  arrested \nin cities who  were  Negroes  was  30.4%.  This  calculation \nalso came  from  \"Crime\"  [Def.  Ex.  No.  36]. \nI  did not  analyze  how  many  persons  were  brought  to \ncity court  on  the  first Tuesday  after their arrests. \nJanuary,  March,  May  and  July were  chosen as  the \nmonths  to  be  used  in the  calculationof  statistics because \nof  the  time  problem.  I  don't know  whether  the  trials  in \nFebruary  and April  of Negro  demonstrators  would  change \nthe  calculation I  made. \nI  did  not  study statistics on  contributing. \nIn the  Dallas  County Criminal  Court,  my  figures  show \nthat ortly 4  of 1228  persons were  fined  over $100.  My \nfigures  also  show  that  there  ha.ve  been only  eight  continu \nances. \nMy  bond  information came  from  defendant's  exhibit \nnumber  28.  I  inadvertently omitted bond  information on \ncarrying concealed weapons  and  trespassing after warning. \nMy  working  papers  show  that  Floyd Wilson's  bond  for \ncarrying a  concealed weapon was  listed as  $500.  I  did \nnot  check  the  original  records  of bonds.  The  original \nbond  for Floyd Wilson,  does  appear  to be  $300. \nC-53-b \n\nE.  J.  DIXON \n{White) \nI 1ve  been an  investigator for  the  Alabama  Department \nof Public  Safety for  about  thirteen years.  I  was  a  state \ntrooper before  that. \nOn  the  afternoon of July 6,  I  was  with Sheriff Clark, \ninvestigator Head,  Major Jones,  and  probably  Deputy  Crocker. \nWe  saw  an old model  automobile  parked with  six boys  in it. \nWe  went  up  to  the  car,  and  Sheriff Clark  arrested  the  boys. \nThis  incident  occurred  in the  early afternoon  about  1:00 \nor 1:30 within a  block  or two  or three  of  the  railroad \nbridge.  There  was  an assortment  of clubs  and  nightsticks \nin the car.  There  was  a  second  license  tag  in the  car. \nThere  was  also a  hose  in the  caro  There  was  a  shoulder \npatch  in the  car which  I  was  later told was  a  Ku  Klux \nKlan  patch.  I  do  not  remember  the  residence  of  the  boys. \nI  haven't  heard anything concerning  the  incident  since. \nI  was  in Selma only that  one  afternoon. \nC-54 \n\nN.  B.  CHAMBERS \n(White) \nI'm a  police  captain.  I  was  on  the  watch  July 4-6. \nThat  put  me  in charge  of  the  radio  log.  On  July 4,  I \ncame  on watch  at  3:00  p.m.  There  is a  reference  in the \nlog  at  5:15  to the  r,ralton  Theater stating that. there  is \n\"gang  on  sidewalk.\"  The  first  reference  to  the \\'lilby \nTheater  in the  log  is at  5:32.  Between  that  and  6:00, \nthere  are  three entries  concerning  the ~Jilby.  The  log \nreflects  that  between  6:00  and  6:02,  four  cars,  44,100, \n11,  and  22,  came  to  the  vicinity of  the  Wilby Theater. \n44,  100,  and  22  are  patrol  cars.  Car 11  is an unmarked \ncar.  A captain or a  lieutenant  is usually  in it. \nAt  9:57  p.m.  there  is an  entry that  22  and  44 \nreceived a  a  call  that  a  car had  been hit with  a  bottle \nat  Small  and  Broad. \nOn  July 5,  I  wasยทon duty  from  3:00.  We  were  watching \nBennie Tucker.  All  the  entries  in the  radio  log dealing \nwith Bennie  Tucker on July 5  are:  ยท~~est from  Franklin \n6  to 8  walking-\";  'IWe  see  them\";  \"At vlalton now\"  \"Bennie \nis  at  Dallas  and  Broad\";  \"on way  back now\";  \"at City Bldg. \nin sta wagon. .. \";  and  \"bring one  of  those.\"  \"Those\"  refers \nto  pamphlets.  The  Police  Department  did get  a  copy of  the \nwhich  advertised the  meeting,  giving the  place, \npamphlet~ \ntime,  and  speaker. \nNo  officers had  been assigned to  follow  Bennie  Tucker, \nbut  one  of  the  police  cars  just happened  to  see  h~.  The \ncars had  no  instruction regarding Tucker.  The  unusual  fact \nwas  that Tucker was  taking  carloads  of five  and  six  to  the \nTheater.  I  knew  this although I  did not  leave  the  office \nand  \"most\"  of my  information came  from  the  radio  log. \nAt  9:48  p.m.  there  is an entry concerning car 11,  on \nLawrence;  \"Negro  hit  car with coke  bottle.\"  At  9:57,  there \nis the  following  entry,.  \"Curfew Area  710  Green,  on authority \nof Sheriff Clark.\"  I  went  off watch  at 11:00.  At  11:10 \nthere  is an entry in handwriting  of  B.  N.  Bobo  stating that \ntwo  cars were  to be  dispatched to  the  GWC  Project.  There \nwas  a  bottle  thrown  and  some  window  breakage. \nC-55 \n\nWILLIA1'1  YELDER \n(Negro) \nI've been  principal  of R.  B.  Hudson  High School  for \nnine years.  On  September  16,  1963,  there were  917  absentees \nfrom  a  total of 1517  students.  At  that  time  of  the  year \nthe  daily absenteeism  averages  around  100.  On  September  17 \nthere were  485  students  absent.  Attendance  returned  to \nnormal  about  October  8th.  The  period of high absenteeism \nwas  during  the time  of  the demonstrations.  Police  and \nSheriff  cars  returned  children to  school  \"several times.\" \nOccasionally  children left school when  the  police  left the \nschool.  Judge  Reynolds  talked with ce  several  times  about \nabsenteeism,  but  did  not  so  far  as  I  know  look at the  absentee \nism  records.  I  kept  the  individual  names  of  the  absentees  in \nmy  records.  The  Superintendent  of  schools  also  had  the  names \nof  the  absentees.  I  don't  know  if the  superintendent  gave \nthe  names  to Reynolds.  I  did not  testify in Juvenile  Court. \nC-56 \n\nJAMES  CLARK \n(\\-.'hi te) \nI've been sheriff of  Dallas  Oounty  a  little over \nnine years.  I  attended  the University  of Alabama  and \nJones  Law  School. \nThe  sheriff's department  operates  five  cars.  The \nrad:i'.os  are  on  the  state  trooper network.  Calls  go  out \nfrom  the  sheriff's  office when  it is open;  when  the \nsheriff's  offi.ce closes,  calls go  out  from  the  jail radio. \nThere  is  always  someone  on one of  the  radios. \nI  heard  about  the  meeting  of  the  National  State \nRights  Party  from.  a  handout.  I  instructed my  deputies \nto  cover  the meeting  \"exactly like\" thc.y  covered  Negroes \nmeetings.  I  was  at the National  Sheriffs'  Convention, \nmyself,  so  I  could  not attend  the meeting. \nI  have  ne'\\~er seen  Selma  so  tense  as  it wยทas  on  July Lf.~ \nMy  office was  patrolling all day.  There were  groups  of. \nwhites  all day.  My  office dispersed a  crov1d  at the Walton \nTheater.  Groups  when asked  to  would  junt move  a \nmov~ \nlittle bit.  The  majority were  \"rough looking\"  characters. \nThe  tense  situation lasted all afternoon.,  The  sheriff's \noffice had no  way  to enforce its \not~ers. \nI  was  in my  office when  Mr.  Warren called from  the \nThirsty Boy  and  said that he had  told a  group  of Negroes \nto move  from  tm parki.ng lot.  I  got :tn  my  car with  Rufus \nHead  and  started  toward  the Thirsty  Boy.  On  the  way,  I \nreceived  a  call.  that  there were  Negroes  in the  lunchroom. \nDeputy Hews ten was  already  there;  he  and  were \nl~arren \ntalking,  and  \\varren  was  signing  some  papers. \nI  saw  three  Negroes  at a  table  and  one  leaning  over \nthe  counter.  I  told  the  Negroes,  go,  you're under \n'~et's \narrest.\"  They  just sat there,  so  I  prodded  them..  The \ncattle prod  is the  safest way  to move  recalcitrant people. \nCattle prods  are  bought  through  a  law enforcement  sales \nhouse.  We  had  to use  cattle prods  to get  the students  in \nthe  car.  One  of  them  tried  to kick me.  The  names  of  the \nstudents  had  to  be  filled in at the  time  of  booking.  The \ncharges  were  filled in before hand.  This  is  common  prac \ntice,  as  in distilling and  traffic cases.  Bond  was  set \nimmediately.  The  prisoners  did  not make  bond  immediately~ \nThere was  no  trial that  I  remember.  The  people were \nsearched  in jaj.l.  One  had  a  sling  shot.  I  have  attended \nseveral  seminars  where  the  reports were  that  \"they\"  use \nthem  in riots  in the  North.  It is easy far  ยทthe.  person  to \nsay  it is a  bicycle chaine \nC-57 \n\nI  knew  that  the Civil  Rights  Act  had  been passed,  but \nI  did not  know  that  it gave  Negroes  the  right  to eat  in \nrestaurants  serving  interstate customers.  It was  being \nchanged  all along,  but  I  didn't know  what  finally went  in \nit. \nI  did not  l(now,  either that the  Civil :Rights Act  gavโขa \nNegroes  the  right  to attend the ltJilby Theater.  I  knew \nthere  was  a  potential  riot  there,  and  that was  my  only \nconcern. \nt.Je  received several  reports  concerning  the  theater. \nI  was  there  several  times.  I  was  watching Alvery l.Jilliams; \nWilliams was  moving  among  the  groups,  motioning people  to \ncome  over.  He's  an active  agitator;  he's not  a  native  of \nSelma.  Inspector Head  and  posseman Suther were  with me. \nI  was  driving east on  Selma Avenue;  when  I  little to \nwas'~ \nthe  right\" of the  theater,  V.Jilliams  yelled at me.  He  said \nthat he  wanted  protection.  I  couldn't  see  anything but  a \ngroup  of  Negroes.  I  asked Williams  if he  wanted  to  sign \na  warrant.  Uilliams-said no.  I  had  the  warrants  with me \nin the  car;  I  did not  ask Williams  to  come  to the  court \nhouse.  I  then heard Negroes  yell,  ''Let 1 s  get  'em.\"  I \nradioed  for help and  got  out.  I  tried to  disperse  the \ncrowd.  I  did not  see  the whites  or Negroโขas  with weapons. \nI  swung  my  nightstick to  scare  people.  My  office  tried to \nclear the whole  area.  I  moved  whites  from  across  the \nstreet.  I  then talked with  Mr.  Butler. \nIt was  a  dangerous  situation;  cars with  joy riders \nkept  going  back and  forth. \nI  did not  go  into the  theater itself.  I  did not  know \nwhether  there l-1ere  any Negroes  inside.  I  returned and \ntalked again with Butler.  Butler wanted me  to  put  some  men \nin the  theater.  I  did not  think that  it ยทwas  wise,  because \npeople  would  say the  officers were  blocking the  entrance. \nButler or I  suggested shutting do~m the  tiol:et W1ndow. \nMy  object  that  day was  to get  by without  violence. \nMy  office  dispersed everyone  with  no  business  there.  I \ncontinued to  patrol  that  night.  The  situation eased up \nin the  area of the  Hilby Theater,  but  no  'Where  else  in \nto~~.  I  heard  about  the  bottle  and  the Corsons. \nIn 1963,  there  was  a  meeting  at  the  Tabernacle  Church. \nThere  was  an overflow crowd.  I  had  information about  out \nside whites.  I  did not  talk to Judge  Hare  about  going  to \nthe meeting.  I  do  not  know  whether  Judge  Hare  listened on \nthe  radio.  We  see  each other all  the  ttme;  we've  been \nneighbors.  I  went  to  the meeting  and  later called the  posse. .โข \nThere  were  several  out-of-county cars.  During  the meeting, \nI  received a  request  for  protection from Negroes.  I  tried \nto get  the  whites  to move;  when  they did not,  I  called the \nreserves.  The  whites  then moved  back,  and  there  was  no \nincident. \nC-57-b \n\nI  have  tried to give  protection in other instances \nwhen  requested  to do  so;  I  have  been  \"severely criticized\" \nfor  providing  protection for  Negroes.  There  have  been no \nkillings;  Green Street was  the only time  there  were  injuries. \nMy  office has  attended all mass  meetings  it knew  about \nsince Hay 1963.  The  officers did not  always  take  notes  of \nthe  meetings. \nI  instructed the  same  coverage  of the  Green  Street \nmeeting  as  the other mass  meetings.  I  was  not  feeling \ngood  that night,  so I  remained  in my  office.  When  I \nreceived a  call about  trouble,  I  went  to the meeting.  The \ntear gas  surprised me. \nI  saw  the  t'VJ'o  newsmen  and  heard  they were  going  to  the \nhotel.  I  ordered a  car to lead  them there.  I  had  no  con \nversation with  them. \nIf force  had  not  been used,  things would have  gotten \nworse.  There  were  dark alleys where  the  rocks  had  come \nfrom. \nI  think I  was  in a  car by myself. \nRalph Abernathy was  at  the  meeting  at Mt.  Ararat  Church \nthe  night  of July 6.  Gildersleeve  was  there.  He  asked  if \nthe  sheriff's office was  going  to  protection.  I \nprovidE~ \ntold him  that we  could  not  \"stand for\"  more  rock and bottle \nthrO'I:ยทdng.  I  stayed  there until  about  the  time  the  meeting \nbroke  up.  I  later received a  report  of  rock  throwing. \nt~ile I  was  at  the  meeting,  I  learned of  rock throwing,  over \nthe  fence  of a  chicken yard.  I  saw  a  person  throwing  rocks \nand broken bricks  into the  churchyard.  It looked  as  if they \nwere  piling rocks  for  further  throwing. \nOn  the  afternoon of July 6, ยท Naj ..  Jones,  Lt.  Dixon,  and \nHead  tvere  with me  when  we  arrested six whites.  The  car in \nwhich  the  whites were  arrested had  an out-of-state  tag. \nThere  was  an Alabama  tag  in the  car.  There  was  a  shoulder \nbadge,  which  I  later learned 'tl1as  a  Ku  Klux  Klan  badge  from \nGeorgia.  The  men  arrested were  from Perry County, \nL~abama. \nI  charged  the men  with  carrying  a  concealed weapon.  Later, \nin discussing  the  matter with HcLeod,  I  was  not  too  sure  the \nweapons  were  \"concealed,\" but  I  thought  it best  to confine \nthe men.  McLeod  told me  the  weapons  would  not  qualify as \n\"concealed\". \nI  did not  investigate  to  see whether  the  tags  were \nproper.  Some  deputies  did,  but  I  do  not  remember  what  they \nfound. \nI  had  instructed Chief  Deputy Crocker  that  sureties \nfor bonds  must  have  enough  real  estate free  ann  clear..  There \nis  no  record of  the  holdings  of  the  sureties on  the  bonds  for \nthe whites,  but  the  bonds  contain affidavits. \nC-57-c \n\nDuring  the week  of July 6,  the Dallas  County  Grand \nJury,  the  Circuit  Court,  and  the Board of Registrars \nwere  in session at various  times.  The  Grand  Jury was  prob \nably not  in session every day  of  the week.  I  am  sure  the \nCircuit Court was  in session,  although  I  do  not  whether \nl~now \nthere was  a  jury session.  Reporters  told us  pickets were \ncoming  at a  certain time.  There was  a  registration line \nand court was  in session,  so we  arrested the  pickets_ \nAfter  the  pickets were  arrestedโข  a  large group  of people  on \nthe  steps  started singing and  carrying on,.  \"They wouldn't \nstop,\" so  I  had  them arrested.  I  up  several signs. \npicl~ed \nNone  said anything  about  the  Circuit  Court  or  the  Grand  Jury. \nSeveral  of  them had my  name  on  them.  Yes  T could  them \n~ing \ntomorrow.  These  pictures  [Def.  Ex.  Nos.  44-A  and 44-B]  have  no \ndate  on  them.  ยทยทThey  show  pickets with  signs.  The  first one \nsays,  \"One  Man  One  Vote  Register Now.\"  These  [Def.  Ex.  No.  45] \nshow  groups  of people by  the  courthouse  and  on  the Post  Office \nDrug  corner.  '\"\"we  made  charges  of  interfering with court\" \nagainst  all persons  arrested.  That's  a  city.charge.  No \ncharges  made  concerning  the  Board  although we \no~ Registrars~. \ncould have.  \"\\,Jhen  they  came,  they brought\" several young \nchildren;  I  could have  made  a  contributory charge  concerning \neach child,  but did not.  My  main  purpose was  to get people \noff the  street,  not  to  throw  the book  at them.  There was  a \nlot of disturbance,  and  I  wanted peace. \nI  set bond  as  fast  as  possible.  1r1e  set the  same  bond \nfor  all persons,  because  lV'e  didn't know  the  individual  facts \ntoo well.  He  used LaPorte  and  other  city men.  He  used  the \ncounty  jail because  of  its size.  The  violation charged was \na  city violation!  so  city affidavits  had  to be  used.  A \n$500  bond was  orkginally set because  the  charge was  of  a \n\"serious  nature\";  as  soon  as  I  found  that $300  was  the \nmaximum  for  city charges,  bond was  reduced.  Peter Hall \nworked with me  amicably  on  the  bond.  Hall was  always  told \nhe  could  bond.  Monday,  we  agreed  to  lower  bonds  on \nm&~e \nthe  suggestion of  Judge Allgood.  Then  Judge  Thomas  came \nu.s. \nback,  and  the  Court  took  jurisdiction.  I  never refused \nbond.  I  never  put Hall  off;  I  never  told him he  could not \nget bond.  I  did not want  to keep  people  in jail, but  \"just \nwanted  to restore  order.\"  In fact,  Dallas  County  told me \nto get  the  prisoners  out of  jail. \nI  worked  \"very closely\" with Blanchard HcLeod  in July, \n1964.  If possible,  we  discussed charges.  It may  be  that \non  July 6,  I  talked over  the  charges  with him.  He  assisted \nin some  arrests.  I  prepared the  questionnaires  used  in the \njail.  McLeod  may  have  seen them. \nI  made  the  decision  on  the  contributing charge.  \"They \nwalked  down  together;  they were  all there  together.\"  A \nchild goes  with  an  adult  only when  led. \nMy  office did as  much  investigation as  possible,  but \nthere was  not much  time.  There were  so many  arrested \nper.~ons \nand  so many  incidents. \nC-57-d \n\nI  am  not  sure  of  the reasons  for  a  $200  bond  being \n.listed oh  th~ booldng  sheets  for some  of  the  persons  arrest. .. \ned when  they were  picketing.  I  don't know  why  an  additional \n$200  bond  is listed for Gloria Bostick;  perhaps  she was  a \nrepeater.  I  don't know  about  The.odis  Hawkins;  a  lot of \ntypographical  errors  are made5  One  of  the bonds  for Frederick \nReese  is listed as  \"$200  peace\";  this  is not  a  peace  bond, \nbut  a  bond  for  peace  proceedingsf>  I  suppose  there  is a  ยท \nwarrant  to  support  the bond;  I  suppose  I  could find  it to \nnight. \nThe  sheriff is to  set bail on  all cases  except capi \ntal cases.  Blanchard McLeod  has  nothing udirectly\" to do \nwith bonds  until  a  case comes  to county court.  Judge  Hare \nhas  nothing to do  with setting bonds  in the  ordinary case; \nunless  there  is  a  grand  jury indictment.  I  have no  iron \nclad rules  on  bonds,  but  a  general  rule  is  that  the bond \nfor  traffic offenses  is  $100,  for misdemeanor  $300,  and  for \n\"serious misdemeanors\"  $500.  The  bond  for  felonies  is  $500 \nor more.  Several  bonds  are  personal;  Selma  Bail Bond  Com \npany  is  the main bond companyo  Anyone  can qualify as  a \nbondsman  if he meets  the  statutes.  Bonds  are  lower  for  Neg \nroes. \nThe  procedure upon  taking a  prisoner  to  jail is  to \ntake  him  to  the  booking desk,  empty his  pockets,  and  fill \nout a  booking  sheet.  A booking  sheet  is generally handwrit \ntent  then  typed  in triplicate.  One  copy goes  to  the  sheriff's \noffLce  for  the  officer's use.  one  goes  to  the  jail for  cross \nreference;  one  is a  work  sheet  that is corrected as  changes \nare made.  I  don't know  whether we  brought  the  correct book \ning sheets  to court.  Bond  is usually set at the  time  of \nbooking. \nIn the  summer  of  1964,  I  received 1'quite a  bit of \nintelligence\"  that extremists  \"from both races\"  wanted vio \nlence.  The  racial  situation eased up  after the  arrests  on \nJuly 6,  but it was  still tense.  There  was  a.  lot of  rock \nthrowing;  there were many  reports  of  incidentso  cf \nC::-c~ps \nwhites  were  planning  to  take  the  law  into  their own  hands. \nTherefore,  officials  petitioned for  an  injunction.  To  the \nbest of my  knowledge, 'information,  and  belief the complaint \nwas  true.o \nThe  situation before  the  injunction was  very tense. \nAfter the  injunction,  \"It eased off a  bit.\"  \"I  shudder to \nthink\" what would  have  happened if there had not been  an \ninjunction..  I  am  \"positive\"  there would  have  been serious \ntrouble without  it. \nI  don't know  whether  the  events  listed in the  complaint \nfor  the  injunction start with  the Hilby Theater.  Carol \nLawson  is a  Negro  female;  \"she was  working with a  group  of \nagitators.\"  I  had  information  to  that effect.  I \narr~oted \nher  at the Thirsty Boy;  that was  before  the tvilby  incide~n.l:. \nC-57-e \n\nThe  Henry Aronson  incident arose when  \"I  found  a  man \nthat didn't have  authority to  be  there\" at the  jail.  The \njailer said the man  was  the u.  s. Marshall,  but I  knew  he \nwas  not.  I  asked  the marshalls who  the man  was,  but  they did \nnot know.  I  asked Aronson  to  leave,  but he  would not.  There \nfore,  I  grabbed him  and escorted him  out  of  the  jail.  Ex\"!' \ncept  in emergencies,  there  are no  visitors allowed in  the \njail except  on  Sundays.  Attorneys,  law enforcement  officers, \ndoctors,  and  preachers  are  allowed  in the  jail if they state \ntheir business.  Aronson  did not  say he  was  representing the \npeople  in  jail.  I  did not know  he was  a  lawyer. \nI  remember  \"nothing whatsoever\"  about  kicking Charles \nJohnson. \nI  heard about  the  testing of  Carter Drug  and  the  Glass \nHouse  only from  hearsay..  The  radio log entry,  ucontact  the \nChief  Ref.  Leo  Taswยทell\",  does  not  refresh my  recollection, \nat all.  [Upon  being  shown  the.next  entry,  \"Contact Hajor \nRichardson\":]  Major Richardson was  in my  office nearly every \nday,  at my  invitation. \nThere  was  a  meeting  after the injunction in Colonel \nAult's office.  Col. Ault,  Col.  CUrtis,  Maj.  Richardson,  and \nMaj.  Ely,  the  \"Commisar\" were  present.  lยท1ajor  Richardson \nhad asked me  how  the  injunction would  affect the base.  I \nproposed a  meeting.  Major Richardson invited Judge  Hare. \nI  brought up  the  subject  of  the meeting of  the Negro  Airman \nat  the  Elk's  Club.  Col. Ault  appeared quite disturbed.  I \nsuggested we  might  look  into it.  Col. Ault  told Naj. \nRichardson to cooperate  as  far  as military regulations  would \nallow.  There was  a  general  discussion.  Judge  Hare  had not \nmuch  to  say,  except  interpreting some  phrases  of  the  injunc \ntion.  He  made  no  request  that  the Air Force  enforce  the  in \njunction.  Hare  did not  throw  the weight of  his  office \nagainst Craig;  \"quite  the contrary\";  he  said the  only pur \npose  of his  injunction was  to  keep  the  peace.  The  meeting \nlasted about  two  hours. \nAfter going  to  the meeting  at Craig,  I  went  to  take \nthe  license.  I  am  not  sure whether  I  discussed  taking the \nlicense with Blanchard NcLeod.  I  did not discuss  it with \nJudge  Hare. \nI  had  heard about  a  meeting attended by Rev.  Smeltzer. \nI  talked with him  once;  \"his actions  didn't prove''  he  was \nfor better race  relations.  It seemed  to me  as  if Smeltzer \nwas  \"always  around when  trouble  arises.\"  ''v.7ith  Smeltzer's \nreputation,  we  thought we'd better look into\"  the meeting. \nI  don't know  what  was  discussed at the meeting.  I  talked \nwith  the ABC  and  told them  I  thought  the man  had violated ยท \nthe  injunction.  Ralph Shuttles,  Chief  of  the License  Divi \nsion of ABC,  told me  he  thought  I  could pull  the  license \nand  send it in.  I  did not  revoke  the license,  but merely \npulled it.  Regulation  36,  ยง2,  ABC  Rules  of 1964  provides \nthat  any  law  enforcement  officer can  go  to  the  premises  of \na  place with an ABC  License without  a  warrant.  I  went with \nJ. L.  Chestnut,  Sr.  and  J. L.  Chestnut,  Jr., who  is a  lawyer. \nI  broke  down  no  doors  and  broke no  locksw  I  had no warrant. \nThe  Chestnuts'  knew  nothing about  the meeting. \nMy  men  could  find nothing from  the  airmen. \nC-57-f \n\nI  held  the  license.  Some  people  asked me  to  hold \nthe  license  and not  to  send  it in.  I  agreed with members \nof  the  Elks  Club  to wait until Moss  returned.  Hoss  said \nthat  ignorance was  behind  any wrongdoing.  Since  then, \nthe  Elks  Club  has  been  straight down  the  line. \nJudge  Hare  once  asked me  to bring  to him  students \nfrom  Selma University who  had been  arrested.  The  meeting \ntook place  around nine  in the  evening.  Judge  iiallory \nand  Judge Hare were  there.  Judge  Hallory had no  probation \npower,  so  the  students were  turned  over to  Judge  Hare. \nI  have  seen  no  acts whatsoever  committed by  Judge \nHare  to  vlolate Negroes'  rightso  In  some  cases,  Judge  Hare \nwill put a  Negro  on  probation where  he would  put  a  white \nin  the  penitentiary.  I  have  seen  no  acts  whatsoever  com \nmitted against Negroes  during  racial difficulties.  Judge \nHare  has  nothing  to  do  with County  Cburts  or  the  City Court, \nthe  only Courts of preliminary  jurisdiction in Selma. \nSolicitor 11cLeod  has  requested  that I  report serious \ncrimes  to  him  for  investigation.  I  have  never seen McLeod \nas  circuit solicitor,  abuse  any Negro.  I  think HcLeod \nhas  nol prossed  ยท  too  many  cases  against Negroes.  I  have had \nlittle contact ,;nth Judge  Reynolds  except  cases  of  juveniles \nand  insane  persons.  I  have  n.ever  seen Reynolds  handle \nNegroes  differently  than whites. \nThe  City of Selma has  always  cooperated with me.  The \nPolice  Department  has  dispatched cars  many  times.  Hy  agree \nment with  Chief Hullen was  based on  the  fact  tb.s.ยท  Code \nspecified that the  Sheriff  is  the Chief  Law  Enforcement \nOfficer  in the  County.  I  was  in charge,  but my  office \nalways  consulted the  police.  There  was  no  agreement  the \ncity would  not  act  to  protect Negroes;  there was  never  any \nrelinquishment of  authority.  The  city does  not  have  an \nadequate  force  to  handle most  of  its routine work  and \nincidents  such as  the  one  Selma had.  As  I  stated in  the \nMcLeod  case,  the  Sheriff was  to  direct both the Police \nDepartment  and  the  Sheriff's Department,  and  they work \ntogether.  The  city never gave  up  its patrol work  to me. \nSelma's  Police  jurisdiction extends  three miles  beyond  its \nborders.  Selma has  grown  considerably,  but  the Police \nForce has  not. \nThere  have  been many  outside  Negroes  in  the County. \nI  remember vJolf  Dawson  the best.  I  remember  arresting \nBernard Lafayette  for vagrancy,  I  think,  in June,  1963., \nIt was  a \"constant thing\"  for newsmen  to  say  they were \ninformed by Atlanta  that there would be  trouble,  not  just \npickets,  but  trouble.  Once  TV  men  came  from  all over. \nThere  was  real trouble  that afternoon.  There  had been \n\"just isolated trouble\"  that morning. \nยทIn September 1963  I  was  in  charge  of  the  arrests.  MY \noffice was  arresting  people  coming  out of  the Churcl't  two  by \ntwo  for marching.  There  were many  other arrests,  but  I \nc-s7 .. \ng \n\ndo  not remember  whether  they were  for  picketing or Breach \nof  Peace  or what. \nI  arrested Benny  Tucker  in the white washroom for \ncriminal  provocation. \nI  now  have  nine  field deputies.  During  1964,  I  had \neight regular deputies  andยทfour hired on specially.  I \nhad four  deputies  and  several special deputies  l-7hen  I \nstarted the  job.  In July  196L~ we  could not,  I  think,  have \nhandled  the  situation without  the  posse.  He  did not  need \nthe  National  Guard. \nI  organized  the  posse.  There had been no  racial  . \nproblems  before  the  posse  was  formed.  There had been two \nincidents,  not  racial,  that needed more  men  than  the \nsheriff's office had.  There  are four  major  divisions  to \nthe  posse.  The  mounted  posse  consists  of  people  interested \nin horeshows  and  parades.  The  land rescue  posse  grew out \nof  the  flood  of  1961.  Its members  helped hunt for  lost \nchildren and engaged  in Civil Defense work.  The  water  posse \nwas  formed  after the  Sheriff's office had  to call on  Chillum \nCounty  for help when  a  man  fell off a  trestie in the Alabama \nRiver  and drowned  in 1960.  The  posse  dragged for bodies \nin 1961;  it helped  to rescue  3,000 people  in the  flood. \nIn the  Spring  of  1964,  it rescued several hundred  persons \nin a  flood.  The  dismounted  posse  is \"more  or  less  reserve \nforce.\"  The  entire posse  is composed  of volunteers โข . I \nhave  no  voice  in appointing members  or  officers  of  the  pease. \nI  do  \"reserve  the right  to  turn anyone  down\"  for  bad back \nground  or misbehaviQr. ยท About  twenty-four  members  of  the \nposse  have  been expelled for  misbehavior.  Host  of  these \nwere  dropped by  the  screening committee,  not by  the  sheriff. \nCivil  Defense  has  t&~en over many  of  the  functions  of  the \nwater posse  and  land rescue  posse;  that  operation carries \non many  civil defense  classes. \nSolicitor NcLeod  and  I  have  held classes  in the  law \nof  arrests  and  search and  seizure.  Posse  are  instructed \nnot  to  t&~e the  law  in their own  hands.  Its members  are \ntold  that  they  are  to  \"enforce  the  law  at all ti.mes  without \nany  discrimination whatsoever.\" \nThe  posse  almost  always  has  experienced  law men  with \nit. \nSince  Nay  1963,  I  have  used the  posse  outside  Dallas \nCounty  on racial matters.  I  took  the  posse  to Tuscaloosa \nwhen  the  University  of Alabama was  integrated.  The  posse \nwas  with me  for  \"some  time\" in Birmingham.  Some  possemen \nwere with me  in Tuskegee  the  time  wbe.h  school  desegre \ngation had been ordered.  I  went  to Notasulga at the  time \nNegroes  went  to school  for  the  first time;  no  possemen were \nwith me  at that time. \nc-57-h \n\nJANES  BARE \n(White) \nI'm fifty-eight.  I'm circuit  judge  for  the  Fourth \nJudicial  Circuit.  The  circuit  is composed  of five  counties, \nincludin~ Dallas.  L.  S.  Moore  is the  presiding  judge.  I \nam  the  associate  judge.  It isยท customary  far  one  of \nthe  judges  to  stay in.  this county.  Sixty-five  to  seventy \npercent  of  the:  litigation is  in Dallas County.  Since  the \nsummer  of l95Liยท,  I 1ve  been a  circuit  judge.  I  was  circuit \nsolicitor for  about  eight  years  before  that.  I  spent  four \nyears  as  a  legal  officer  in the Air  Force,  retiring as  a \nmajor.  I  was  in the Alabama Attorney General's office. \nI  graduated  in law  from  the  University of Alabama.  Under \nSection 157  of'  the  Alabama Constitution,  I'm the highest \nconservator of the  peace  in the  circuit.  Going  back  to  the \ncommon  la~.,,  I  assume  I  would  call out  the  National  Guard  or \ninvoke  marshal  law. \nI  deal  with punishment  and  probation matters  in my \ncourt.  Those  matters  are  generally within my  discretion. \nI  have  some  fairly set  policies;  for  example:  burglary \nand  larceny are  normally probationary offenses.  The  court \nhas  a  trained probation worker  to conduct  some  investigation \nfor each person to be  sentenced.  I  do  not  hold Negroes  to \nthe  same  degree  of  accountability as  whites.  I  am  much \nmore  lenient  on probation for Negroes  than for whites, \nsince  Negroes  are better for  probation than are whites. \n\"I have  not\" used my  office  to discriminate  against  Negroes \nin any way. \nPeter Hall  handled  four  or five  racial  cases  on appeal \nbefore me.  I  do  not  recall  any  other racial  cases. \nI  spend most  of my  time  in Dallas County,  and  am  re \nquired by law to have  four  criminal  and  four  civil  jury \nsessions  annua.lly.  There  is hardly any day  of  the  year \nduring which  the  court  is not  in session.  Equity takes \nabout  seventy percent  of my  time.  Circuit  court  was  in \nsession July 6. \nI  have  never  given any  advice  to the  sheriff on how  to \nhandle  pickets.  [After an  excerpt  from his  testimony begin \nning  on  page  Liยท83  of the  record  in the NcLeod  case  was  read \nto him'' Hare  stated:]  On  one  occasion,  the  Sheriff came  up \nand  asked  for my  opinion.  I  had  advised  the  Sheriff not \nto  act,  that  picketing was  not  in itself illegal,  in the \nabsense  of  \"some  turmoil  or congregation of  people  or \nsomething.\"  I  think that's the  only time  I  gave  advice  to \nthe  sheriff concerning  the  handling of pickets.  [To  the \nquestion,  Did  Sheriff Clark come  to your  office  in July:] \nMr.  Doar,  I  have  had  numerous  conferences  with the  sheriff., \nBlanchard McLeod,  and  the Chief of  Police.  \"I  felt  it wasยท \nmy  duty\"  as  chief conservator of the  peace  to keep  informed. \nC-58 \n\nDuring  the  past  two  years  I  have  received reports \nfrom  time  to  time  concerning  the  \"racial situation\" in \nSelma.  I  \"personally received some  intelligence\"  con \ncerning a  paratroop drop  by  the  J.Olst Airborne  Division \nin \"early September\"  1963ยท~  I  \"considered it a  matter \nof  the utmost  gravity.\"  I  called the  sheriff and  the \nforeman  of  the grand  jury into my  office.  I  asked  the \nsheriff to make  discreet  inquiries.  I  made  contact \nwith Congressman Armistead Seldon,  a  friend,  and Congress \nman  George  Huddleston.  I  received  communication from \nSeldon with  an  attached  letter from  the Department  of \nthe Army,  defendant's  exhibit No.  46.  ~Jhile the  contem \nplated air-drop was  to have  taken place in the  first week \nof  September,  1963,  the  letter of response  from  the Depart \nment  of the Army  came  in March  or April  of 1964.  Up  until \nSeptember  16,  1963,  it had been a  \"lethargic  summer.\" \nOn  September  27  or  28,  1963,  I  observed  a  television \ncamera by  the  Chevrolet Company  near  the  courthouse  on  the \nway  back  from  lunch.  Up  to  that  time  it had  been  a  very \nnormal  day.  I  saw  another  television truck across  the \nstreet.  A member  of  one  of  the  television crews  told me, \n\"I  don't know v1hy  I  came,  but  'you  can be  damn  sure  I \ndidn't  come  all the way  from Atlanta'  to  take  pictures of \npickets.\"  I  walked  on  and  observed many  strangers  in front \nof  the  courthouse.  One  said \"all hell was  supposed  to bust \nloose within an hour.\"  I  understand,  although I  did not \nsee  it,  that  there was  some  disturbance  later.  I  haven't \ngiven any  instructions  to  officers  concerning race matters. \n\"No,  sir,  I  purposely  stayed out  of  it\" as  far  as  I  could. \nOnce,  in connection with  the Tabernacle  Church, \nSheriff  Clark urged me  to  come  down  to  the meeting.  I \ncalled John Randolph  Smith,  a  local  attorney,  asked  for \nhis  advice,  and he  took me  to  the  church.  I  suggested \nClark deputize enough men  to  take  care  of  the  situation \nand  then left.  [Asked  about  the  Church  again on  cross.] \nThe  Sheriff asked me  to  come  to  the  Church.  I  came  with \nSmith  and was  in an  auto within a  block  of  the  Church. \n[After his  testimony  in the McLeod  case  was  read  tc him:] \nYes,  I  called the Sheriff  and  told him  to  be  at  the meeting. \nI  listened to  one  radio  broadcast.  [Upon  being read his \ntestimony  in McLeod:]  ~~en I  said I  listened to  radio \nbroadcasts,  that  applied  to  one  meeting,  where  Dick Gregory \nspoke.  Yes,  I  testified I  would  sit at  the Sheriff's  office \nand  listen on  the radio  to every word.  I  meant  that I  heard \nDick Gregory.  Yes,  in the HcLeod  trial I  said I  read notes \nof  the  meetingse  I  meant  in particular  that  I  read notes  of \na  speech Rev.  Hunter  told me  he  had made. \n\"I've been approached  any number  of  times\"  by whites \nand  Negroes  both.  Once,  Attorney James  Chestnut  asked \nme  to  hel~ him with  the  problem of  police surveillance \nof Negro  mass  meetings.  I  contacted Breckenridge's  office \nin Birmingham.  The  office  sent  a  memorandum which was \nof no  use.  I  called Breckenridge  again,  and  he  sent  another \nopLnLon.  I  supplied copies  of  that  to  Chestnut,  tne  Sheriff~s \noffice,  and  the Police  Department. \nC-58-b \n\nJudge  Reynolds  asked me  for  advice  quite  often, \nespecially on matters  concerning  incorrigible  juveniles, \nand  estates.  Once  Judge  Reynolds  told me  that  he  was \n\"utterly swamped\".  He  asked me  if I  could look  at  the \ncode  and  see  whether  there  was  any  provision for  relief \nof  the  probate  judge.  The  probate  judge  is very busy; \nhe  is  ex-officio head  of the  Board  of Revenue.  Judge \nReynolds  is not  a  lawyer.  I  suggested  that  Reynolds \nappoint  referees  when  he  was  swamped,  as  the  code  pro \nvides  for  that.  I  later found  that  Reynolds  had  done \nthis. \nOn  another  occasion,  I  received  a  letter from  a  man \nrepresenting himself  as  a  local  representative  of  the \nNational  States Rights  Party.  He  asked me  about  a  busi \nness  licenseo  I  referred  the  matter  to  Robert  Frye  of \ntm  F.B.I.,  then dictated a  \"casual  letter\" telling him \nI  had  nothing  to  do  with  business  licenses. \nc. \nOn  another  occasion,  Dr.  Owens  and  Rev.  C.  Brm~ \ncontacted me.  Owens  is President  of the  Selma University \nand  Brown  is a  colored minister  in Selma.  Dr.  Owens  was \nconcerned  about  students  arrested  in the  fall  of 1963  for \ndemonstrating.  I  explained  that  the  cases were  not  in my \njurisdiction,  but  that  I  would  contact McLeod,  Clark,  and \nJudge  N:allory  in whose  court  the  cases  were  to be  heard. \nHugh  Mallory  is  the  judge  of  the  Dallas County Court,  an \ninferior court  created with  preliminary  jurisdiction. \nI  have  no  superintendence  over  that  court  except  on  appeal. \nI  get  cases  from  that  court  only on appeal  or by  the grand \njury.  Since  Judge  l1allory had  no  probation power  and  since \nthe  only way  I  could have  jurisdiction without  action by \nthe  grand  jury was  on  appeal,  Mallory,  HcLeod,  Clark,  and  I \nworked  out  an  arrangement  whereby  students  would  plead \nguilt.y  in Judge  Hallory's  court.  Then  they appealed  and \nI  released twenty-three  of  the  t~1enty-five or twenty-six \nstudents  on  their own  recognizance.  It might  be,  that  the \nstudents  sign $300  bonds,  but  I  do  not  know  that.  I  told \nthem  I  was  putting no  restriction on  any  of  them  except  or. \nthe  request  of  Dr.  Owens.  I  did  say  I'd deal  severely with \nthe  students  if they decoyed  children a-c;..ray  from  school. \nI  might  have  heard,  informally,  that  the  first SNCC \nworker  in to~ยฅn was  arrested  for  vagrancy.  I  knew  that  the \npersons  working  among  Negroes  were  engaged  in voter  regis \ntration drives  and  encouraging  people  to  vote.  I  understand \nthat  some  of  the  demonstrations had  nothing  to  do  with voting. \nThroughout  the  period  from  September  of 1963  the  racial \ncondition was  \"deteriorating.\"  In July 1964,  I  became  aware \nthat  the  ''general  racial  condition\"  had  worsened.  There  had \nbeen provacative  incidents;  the  National  States  Rights  Party \nheld  a  meeting;  there were  outside Ku  Klux  elements  in town. \nUp  to  that  time,  none  of the  white  citizens  and  no  respon \nsible  Negro  citizens had  been  involved. \nC-58-c \n\nThe  situation was  \"very tense\"  after July  2.  The \nfeeling 'tv-as  high  that  Selma needed  an injunct ion or \nmartial  1 a1.  I  kne~;r that  the  Civil  Rights Act  had been \npassed.  I  wยทas  a'tV'are  that  it applied  to  theaters  and \nrestaurants  serving  interstate customers.  I  was  aware \nNegroes  were  arrested for  trespassing  at  Thirsty Boy. \nI  understood  from  an article by Hacon Heaver  that  tres \npass  laws  were  still in effect.  I  had heard  that  Negroes \nhad  entered on  the white  side  and  sat  in the Wilby Theater. \nIn July,  Nr.  Pitts ยทt:ad'l.ed me .:and  -asl~~d if l  could \nhear him  on a  matter of  importance.  Pitts \nconsidera~le \nbrought  with him  some  handwritten affidavits.  Subsequently, \nPitts  presented  the  complaint  to me  with  a  verification. \nI  read  about  two-thirds  of  the  affidavits.  It was  not \nnecessary for me  to do  so,  but  I  normally like  for  the \ncourt  to be  appraised of  the  background.  I  did not  make \nany  list of  the  affidavits,  but  I  \"certainly did\"  take \nthem  into consideration.  It is common  for me  to  take  into \nconsideration affidavits  that  are  not  filed. \nI  signed  the  decree  on  the  sworn  bill of  complaint, \nbut  only after considerable  legal  research.  Clemens  v ... \nCOPยฃ  was  an important  case  in my  consideration.  I  spent \nabout  3  hours  in the  library and  shepardized virtually \nevery case  considered by the  court.  The applicants had \ndone  considerable legal  research.  My  decision to  issue \nthe  complaint  was  not  a  hasty one,  but  a  \"considered \njudgment.\"  The  injunction could have  been dissolved on \nproper  application.  Notion can be  made  for  a  hearing \nwithin  three  days.  The  National  States Rights  Party \ndemurred,  but  no  other  party did  anything  in the Circuit \nCourt.  No  party moved  to dissolve  or to  amend.  Instead, \nremoval  was  sought.  The  removal  did not  dissolve  the \ninjunction;  it is  still in effect. \n[After  stating again  the whites  were  not  involved before \nJuly 1  t'.nd  that  \"5ood Negroes\" were  not  involved  either:] \nI  have  been  a  of SeLma  for  years,  but  I  was \nres~dent  t~~e \nborn  and  reared  in  Dallas County.  I  am  familiar with  the \nclergy.  I  know  Rev.  Girard,  Mr.  Rhodes,  Rev.  Matthews, \nc.  c. \nHunter,  and Rev.  Brown.  At  the  time  of  the  injunction, \nc.c. \nI  did not know  of  participation and  agitation by  Brown, \nA.  B.  Rev.  Bradford,  Rev.  Minifee,  H.  B.  Plunkett, \n\\~itP-, \nJohn Crear,  and E.  L.  Moss.  I  think  I've met  Rev.  Minifee \nand have  known  E.  L.  Moss  for  years.  I  don't  know  whether \nE.  L.  lvloss  ~1as  an  \"agitating Negro\"  or a  \"good Negro.\" \nAny  of  those  persons \"t-Jere  free  to  come  in and  ask to be \nstricken from  the  injunction,  but  none  did.  As  to  the \nministers,  I  was  informed  that  they had  donated  or offered \ntheir churches  for  the  mass  meetings.  I  did  not  know  who \nthe  arrested people  were  at  the  Thirsty Boy  or outside  the \ncourthouse.  Neither did  I  know  the  SNCC  connection of the \npersons. \nC-58-d \n\nThere  is  nothing  in my  injunction to  prohibit  the \nexercise  of civil  rights.  It would  not  apply to the \nThirsty Boy  or  the Wilby Theater.  The  restriction is \nagainst  public  disorder.  It was  directed to  people \nengaged  in brawls.  It was  also directed against men \nlike  Dick Gregory,  Hartin Luther King,  and  James  Foreman, \nthe whole  \"parade  of galaxieso\"  I  could  sit down  and \ntalk with  the  ministers,  although  I  did not  know  very \nmany  of  them.  I  rarely know  the  persons  I  issue  an \ninjunction against.  This  injunction does  not  touch  voting.- \nin any manner.  I  never  intended  to  enjoin churches.  Theยท ยท \ninjunction does  11ot  affect  \"fraternal  orders  or  \"normal \nn \n7 \nlife .. \" \nMajor  invited me  to Craig Air Force  Base. \nRichardo~n \nRichardson  and  I  haa  discussed  police  jurisdiction in the \nN.B.F.  homes  several  times.  We  had had lunch  at Craig. \nI  have  been  by many  officers  at Craig.  Richardson \n~onsulted \nand  I  discussed  the  injunction,  and Richardson  then  in \nvited me  to Craig.  I  did not  try to  force  Craig  to enforce \nthe  injunction.  I  explained  that  I  think the  injunction \nis constitutional,  legal,  and  still  in.forQe.  I  think I \nadvised  I  thought  an  airman  could violate  the  injunction \nas  could anyone  else.  The  meeting  at  the  Negro  Elks Club \nmight  have  involved  a  violation of the  injunction.  I  did \nstate  that  \"the  only evidence  was  that  all  these  soldiers \nhad  taken the Fifth Amendment\"  when  they were  interrogated. \nThe  sheriff's office  or Major  Richardson had  interrogated \nthem;  I  was  not  then present.  At  the  meeting,  there was  a \ndiscussion about  the  state's right  of  process.  At  this \ntime  there  came  up  the  subject  of possible  grand  jury \ninvestigation.  Because  the  matter was  in federal  court, \nI  said that  the  County would  postpone  grand  jury action \nand  leave  the  investigation up  to  Craig.  It was  determined \nalso  that McLeod  would  withhold  action pending  Craig's \nown  determination of what  to  do. \nI  had no  information concerning  the  liquor license  of \nthe  Negro  Elks  Club until Mr.  Moss  called me.  I  did not \neven know  what Moss  wanted  to  see  me  about  until  he  got \nthere.  I  don't know  why  Moss  called me  unless  it was \nbecause  I  had  given an  address  of welcome  at  the  Negro  Elks \nConvention. \nC-58-e \n\nWilSON  BAKER \n(White) \nSince  October  5,  1964,  I've been Director of  Public \nSafety for  the  City  of Selma.  From 1940  to 1942  or 1943, \nI  was  a  claims  adjuster  for  the  Southern Railway.  I  was \nwith the Selma Police  from January  of  1946  to January  of \n1958.  From  then until  this year  I  taught  police work  in \nthe  vocational division of the  University of Alabama.  I \nlived  ยทhere  on weekends  while  teaching.  I've attended \nand  instructed seminars  at the  University,  in New  York \nCity,  Montgomery,  St.  Louis,  and  so  on.  I  attended \nNewburgh  College  in South Carolina and  the  University  of \nAlabama.  I've done  advanced work  at Rutgers  and  St. \nLawrence. \nIn September,  1963,  1  was  present for  about  two \ndays  during  picketing.  I  saw  \"quite  a  few  people \nparading  or  attempt  to  parade\" on  Lawrence  Street.  I \nsaw  an  arrest.  I  also saw  some  parading  on Broad Street \nand some  crowds  by  the  Standard Oil  Station.  It \n\"celC'tainly was\"  a  \"tense  situation.\"  I  saw no  physical \nabuse  to Negroes  during  the  arrest. \nIn July  1964,  I  knew  I  was  returning to Selma.  I \ntried to keep  in touch.  I  was  not here  on  the weekend  of \nJuly 4,  but was  here  on other weekends.  I  observed a \n\"very  tense\"  situation.  People  on both sides were  \"very \nexcited.\" \n[Upon  being  shown  Def.  Ex.  No.  1:]  Items  \"like \nthis,\" that  is,  a  chain with a  weight  attached,  can be \nused  as  a  slingshot.  [To  the  question whether he \ncon~ \nsidered this  a  dangerous  weapon]  It \"very definitely \ncould be  used as  a  dangerous  weapon.\"  It :is  standard \npractice to  question a  person arrested.  It would be \nstandard practice to  question about  the  chain with the \npadlock.  I  would  not necessarily accept  an explana\" \ntion without  checking  it.  I  \"certainly would\"  check \nan explanation before rejecting it. \nSince  I  became  Director of  Public  Safety for  the \nCity of  Selma on October  s,  1964,  there have  been  two \nracial incidents  on which  the  city police have  taken \naction.  One  occurred  December  19 when  non-resident whites \nbeat a  local white who  had expressed sympathy for  Negroes \ngoing  to  church.  The  police have  apprehended  the men \nwho  administered  the  beating and have  charged all except \none  who  is in the  hospital with robbery  and  assult with \nintent to commit  murder.  On  December  21,  1964,  there was \na  young  Negro  assaulted in front  of  the  Y.M.c.A.  in Selma. \nThe  city police apprehended  two  white  youths  and  have \nbooked them. \nC-59 \n\nBLANCHARD  McLEOD \n(Hhite) \nI'm Circuit Solicitor for  the  Fourth Judicial Circuit. \nI  live in Camden,  Wilcox  County. \nI  had been  attending  a  picnic  on July 4p  A highway \npatrolman  told me  to contact  the  sheriff,  who  told me  that \nAlvery \\-Jilliams  had  incited a  riot. \nAfter  I  arrived in Selma  on  July 4,  I  heard about a \nbottle  throwing  incidento  After that,  I  asked state  troopers \nto watch my  wife  and children on  their way  out  of town.  I \nhad  troopers  drive me  home  later. \nI  arrived in Selma  about  10:00 on July s.  I  was  in \nCrocker's  office when  D~luth and  Prince  arrivedo  Crocker \nasked questions  and  took dot-m  the  answers.  vJhen  I  heard \nthe name,  Jerry DeMuth,  I  looked for  an  article D~1uth had \nwritteno  He  said the  inaccuracies  tยทTere  not his,  but  that \nhis editors had changed  it for a  better story.  DeMuth  had \nnot  protested the changes.  DeMuth  had given his address \nin Atlanta as  the  SNCC  headquarters;  I  had had  the  tags \ntraced.  Dcl-1uth  said he  was  not  employed  by  SNCC  but  by \nBlack Star.  I  told DeMuth  that  other  la~Jmen sai.d Del1uth \nalways  arrived a  few hours  before  trouble.  I  said,  \"DeMuth, \nyou  are  the man  1<11ho  triggers  incidents.\"  Del!uth  promised \nnot -to  trigger any  incidentsG\" \nSomeone  from  the  Selma Del  reported that Prince  had \na  gun  in his  pocket. \nOn  the  evening  of July S,  I  was  at the  sheriff's officeo \nThere  was  a  great number  of  presons  there,  including  the \nsheriff and  the  troopers.  Sheriff Clark was  there when  the \ntrouble was  called in,  but  I  do  not know  how  long he had \nbeen  there.  Colonel Lingo  was  not  there;  he  was  eating dinner \nat the Elks  Club.  I  had known  of  the  Green Street Meeting; \nthe  situation was  \"very tense.\"  tfuen  I  heard on the radio \nthat there was  a  riot,  I  asked the  trooper to  take me  to  the \nscene.  I  asked Crocker  about  the  injuries;  He  said no  one \nneeded hospitalization.  Some  people  had been hit by  rocks, \nbut  there  were  no  serious  injuries.  I  then ran into  the  tear \ngas.  I  heard someone  say,  \"That's  the one  that was  carrying \na  gun.\"  I  turned and saw Prince  and DeMuth.  I  then heard \nsomeone  suggest  searching  the car.  I  went  over  to \nD~luth's \ncar and  said,  \"D~Iuth, you  promised me  you  tvouldn 't start \nanything.\"  DeMuth  said nothing.  I  then said,  \"Prince,  if \nyou  have  that gun,  you'd better give  it to me.\"  He  said, \nI  don't have  it.  DeNuth  asked for  protection.  I  said,  we \nhaven't hurt you.  t.:re  can't follmr you  all around  town. \nDeNuth  then  said he  wanted protection to get out  of  tmm. \nI  said,  \"You  can certainly get that.\"  I  did not  urd.er  Priru.;;e \nand  Del1uth  to get out of  town;  I  did not  advise  them  to get \nout;  I  did beg  them to get out of  town  and not  to start any \nincidents. \nC-60 \n\nI  do  not  la1ow  if there  is any  other person  in the  radio \nlogs  who  might  be  called \"solicitor.\"  I  am  commonly  called \nsolicitor myself. \nIt was  probably July  8  that  I  was  in my  office at the \nCourthouse  and  the  Grand  Jury had  recessed when  I  decided \nthat I  would  go  uptown  for  something  to  eat.  I  was  on the \ncorner  of  the Drug  Store when  I  saw a  group  of  people  coming \ndown  the  street;  they were  both white  and  colored.  I  returned \nto  the  courthouseo  \"I did not  place anybody  under  arrest.\" \nI  told an  officer that  the grand  jury was  not  in session, \nbut  that  Judge  Hare's  court was.  I  then  took a  sign from \na  piCket,  wrote  on  it the time  and  place  and  other  pertinent \ninformation.  I  left.  I  never  talked with the  arresting \nofficer.  That's all I  did.

I  told the  sheriff  I  did not  know  of  any  law that \na  baseball bat was  a  concealed weapon.  However,  I  told the \nsheriff,  \"it would  be  a  good  idea to hold them,  โขโขโข  because \nthey're up  to no  good.\"  Later,  I  told the defense  attorney \nI  had  not  had  time  to  research the question;  I  did  research \nthe question,  then  gave  instructions  to have  the  cases  nol \nprossed.  I  do  not  know  if the  instructions were  carried out. \nI  have  attended  only one mass  meeting.  Sheriff Clark \nhad  told me  he  heard the Klan was  coming  in.  I  stayed in \nthe  car most  of  the  time  during  the meeting. \nIn the  fall  of  1963  I  made  an arrest  in front  of Carter's \nDrug  Store.  I've made  only two  arrests  as  Circuit Solicitor. \nThe  person  I  arrested was  not  carrying a  registration sign; \nhe  was  advocating  boycotting.  It was  possible there was \nsomething  about  voting on  the  sign but  the main  thing was \nboycotting.  I  had  come  over  when  Harmon  Carter  called me, \nbecause  the  sheriff's office was  empty.  Carter had  asked \nme  to  prevent  a  killing.  I  saw a  lot  of  \"walking  sticks\" \nand believe  that  if I  had  been two  minutes  later the boy \nwould have  been  in a  funeral.  The  grand  jury in Mobile  voted \n13  to nothing  not  to bill me  for  the  arrest. \nC-60-b \n\nPlanitiff's Exhibit Nos.  41  thru 46  appear  to be  pictures \ntaken at  the  Carter Drug  on  the  day  of  the  arrest.

His  ans~1er was:]  \"No,  because  they \nwere  inciting the  public.\"  The  man  that was  arrested at \nCarter Drug  was  charged with unlawful  assembly. \nI  could not go  to  the meeting  in  the  fall of  1963  that \nJudge Hare  held concerning  the  Selma University students. \nI  told Hare  that my  main  concern was  getting  the kids  back \nin school;  I  concurred with his  proposal.  In the  summer \nof  1964,  I  came  to  the meeting  that Ot...rens  instigated,  because \nonly a  Circuit Solicitor can nol  prosse  a  case. \nrrheriff  Clark asked me  to  attend the  organization \nmeeting  of  the  posse  and to give  a  talk.  I  talked ten or \ntwelve minutes.  Later,  I  taught  a  class  on  the  law of  arrest \nand  the  law of  searches  and  seizureso  I  went  through  title \n15  of  the Alabama  Code  section,  taking  an hour and  a  half. \nI  answered more  questions  on  the  use  of  force  than anything \nelse.  I  told the men  that  there  could be  no  killing for  a \nmisdemeanor except  to  save  a  life and  that there  could  be \nno  unreasonable force. \nI  have  no  recollection of ever violating a  law and have \nnever advocated violation of  law.

I  also  tried to \nkeep  in touch \"t-;ri th the  schools,  since  the  principals  of \nHudson High School were  disturbed over  bad  attendance. \nHost  children were  paroled back  to  their parents. \nI  do ~ot discriminate  agains~ any  Negro  child. \nI  spend more  time  with  the  Negroes  because  of  the \ndifference  in the  background. \nThe  County  government  has  \"bent  over backwardsu  to \ndo  everything we  could  to  control  the racial situation. \nSigns  for  colored and whites  were  moved  from  the  drinking \nfountains  in the  courthouse. \nMy  interviews with children are  not  recorded. \nInvestigation of  a  child by  the  child welfare worker  is \nnot  in writing,  and notes  are not  part  of  the  file. \nHy  instructions  to  the  police  are  to  contact me \nupon  the  arrest  of a  juvenile.  On  July 6  I  told the \npolice it was  \"perfectly all right\"  to  hold  children in \njail until  I  heard  the  case.  [To  the question whether \nit was  his  general  practice  to keep  children in  jail \nuntil hearing rather than  to release  them he  answered:] \nI  handle  cases  as  quickly  as  I  can.  I  do  not  turn a  child \nloose until my  office  can  contact  the  parents.  I  have \ngiven definite  instructions  that  juveniles  are  to  be kept \nseparately  from  adults.  Helfare workers would  report \nanything out  of  place  along  these  lines. \nThe  form  [from Pl.  Ex.  No.  21]  filled out  for  Gloria \nBostick is the  form used  in September  and October  of 1963 \nand  in July of 1964.  The  forms  were  filled out  by  a  case \nworker  or myself. \nOn  page A4  of  the records  in Plaintiffts Exhibit \nNumber  21,  there  is a  notation in my  handwriting,  \"evasive \nC-61 \n\nand  so  sent back  to  jail.\"  The  judgment for  Gloria \nBostick,  the  girl who  was  e.va.sive,  states  \"probation.\" \nGloria Bostick was  \"evasive and disrespectful.11  I \nbelieve that she was  released from  jail the day  after \njudgment.  Vashtie  Leashore was  with Gloria Bostick at \nthe  time  of  judgment.  [After being shown  records  that \nindicated Gloria Bostick was  released from  jail on orders \nof  the  Federal District Court,  Judge Reynolds  stated:] \nI  do  not remember  actually whether  she  came  to the  juvenile \ncourt the  day  after  judgment. \n[Upon  being asked whether he had  any  independent \nrecollection of  the  case  of Willie Reynolds:]  I  believe \nwe  released that boy  to his  aunt.  I  have  no  explanation \nof  the fact  that the  records  of  the U.So  District Court \nshow  that Willie James  Reynolds  was  released July 15  on \nthe  order  of that court.  The  date  of  a  judgment  of \nprobation for him is dated July 9. \nIt is not my  general practice to send  persons  on \nprobation back  to  jail, but  \"it has  been done.\" \nThe  racial situation was  tense  last fall  and  spring \nand  in July.  Since  then things  have  been  comparatively \nquiet.  During  the week  of July  5th,  \"the situation was \nvery  tense.\"  I  would not  allow my  wife  and daughters  to \nvisit friends  in North Selma.  [Upon  being  asked whether \nhe  agreed with  the  statement in the  Selma  Times  Journal \nfor  July  9  that Selma was  'well on its way  to its third \nday  of  relative racial calm.\"]  I  agree  that the  situa. .. \ntion was  better,  but  I  would  still not  let my  family  go \nout  at that time. \nI  discussed the  injunction with Judge Hare,  with \nthe  attorneys,  and with  the Board of Revenue.  The  Board \nof Revenue  authorized  the  decision in order  to  stop \nmeetings  on  the  street,  and  so on.  I  think  that  the \ninjunction is all that saved  Selma from  seriotJ.s  trouble. \nThere were  long registration lines from September \nand  October 1963.  Since  then there has  been supervision \nover  lines  in the Courthouse.  On  the  first floor  of  the \nCourthouse,  there  are windows  on  the  east side  of  the hall. \nOn  the west  side,  there  are  only doors  and walls.  The \nBoard  of Registrar's  office is adequate.  Lines  need to \nbe kept  on the west  side. \nc. . \n6l-b ",
