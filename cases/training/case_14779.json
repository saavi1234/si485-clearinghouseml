Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the following policies and practices were illegal: incarcerating indigent debtors for failure to pay court-imposed fines and fees; denying accused misdemeanants the right to counsel at hearings where the accused faced incarceration; and effectively denying indigent persons access to public court records by levying unreasonably high record retrieval fees.     </p><p>On August 9, 2005, the plaintiffs filed an <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/CJ-MS-0001-0002.pdf\">amended complaint</a>, adding three more named plaintiffs to the suit.  Seven months later, the defendants filed a motion to quash and dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs' service of the complaint was improper and insufficient to confer jurisdiction. The District Court (Judge Louis Guirola) <a href=\"http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/CJ-MS-0001-0003.pdf\">denied</a> the motion on August 23, 2006.  </p><p>On September 27, 2006, the District Court stayed the case for 120 days pending settlement discussions. Following these discussions, the parties jointly filed a stipulation of dismissal on January 31, 2007, and the court closed the case.  </p><p>According to a February 1, 2007 <a href=\"https://www.schr.org/node/111\">article</a> in Mississippi's Sun Herald newspaper, the plaintiffs agreed to the dismissal after the city: created a program allowing indigent debtors to perform community service in lieu of paying fines; granted temporary amnesty to debtors with overdue fines; implemented a new court document filing and retrieval system; and doubled its budget for public defenders.</p><p></p>",

      "text": "Case 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 17   Filed 08/23/06   Page 1 of 2\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI\nSOUTHERN DIVISION\nVIRGINIA THOMAS, ET AL.  §\nPlaintiffs, §\n§\nv. § Civil Action No. 1:05CV349LG-RHW \n§\nCITY OF GULFPORT, ET AL.  §\nDefendants, §\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER DENYING \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO QUASH AND TO DISMISS\nAND ALLOWING PLAINTIFFS TO CORRECT DEFECT\nIN SERVICE PURSUANT TO FED. R. CIV. P. 4(m)\nTHIS MATTER COMES BEFORE THE COURT on the Motion to Quash and to\nDismiss filed by the Defendants on March 10, 2006.  Plaintiffs tendered a timely response and\nthe Defendants a rebuttal.  In addition, the parties filed a surrebuttal and surreply.  After\nconsideration of the Motion, the record, the pleadings on file, and the relevant legal authority,\nthe Court finds that the Motion should be denied for the reasons that follow. \nPlaintiffs filed the instant complaint on July 21, 2005.  Thereafter, summonses were\nissued.  The record reflects that the summonses were returned executed on August 2, 2005. \nThe docket specifically reflects that the summons for the City of Gulfport was accepted by\nservice on City Attorney Harry Hewes on July 21, 2005.   The summons named Harry Hewes, in\nhis capacity as the City Attorney. \nThe Defendants, specially appearing through City Attorney Jeff Bruni, now move to\nquash service of process under FED. R. CIV. P. 4 and for dismissal pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P.\n12(b)(2) on the grounds that Plaintiffs’ attempt to serve the City by delivering the summons\n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 17   Filed 08/23/06   Page 2 of 2\nand complaint to the City Attorney was insufficient to confer jurisdiction.  According to the\nPlaintiffs’ response, process was inadvertently served on Mr. Harry Hewes, the attorney for the\nCity of Gulfport instead of Mayor Brent Warr or the City Clerk.  Plaintiffs request that the\nCourt permit them to cure the defect in the service in accord with MISS. R. CIV. P. 4(m). \nThe Court finds that due to the history of the present case, the Plaintiffs have shown\ngood cause such that they should be permitted additional time to serve the Defendants. \nAccordingly,\nIT IS ORDERED AND ADJUDGED, that the Motion to Quash and Dismiss pursuant\nto FED. R. CIV. P. 4 and 12, filed March 10, 2006, [12-1] should be, and is hereby DENIED. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED, that the Plaintiffs are granted ten\ndays from the date of this order in order to cure service upon the Defendants in accord with\nFED. R. CIV. P. 4.\nSO ORDERED AND ADJUDGED this the 23th day of August, 2006.\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:10)(cid:10)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)\ns/            \nLOUIS GUIROLA, JR.\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n ",

In support thereof, Plaintiffs \nrespectfully state as follows: \nPREI JMINARY STATEMENT \n1. \nThis is an action to stop Defendants, the City of Gulfport and the Judges of \nthe Gulfport Municipal Court, from an abuse of their authority, through which \nthey have been imprisoning indigent misdemeanants for nonpayment of fines in \ntotal disregard for the law.  Due to the actions of Defendants, the Harrison County \nJail in Gulfport, Mississippi has become a modem day debtors' prison.  The jail is \npacked with indigent men and women serving sentences for failure to pay \"old \nfines.\"  Many of these people are completely destitute.  Some are also mentally ill, \nmentally retarded, and/or physically disabled.  They are unable to pay the fines \n2 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 3 of 57\nimposed upon them.  Over three decades ago, the United States Supreme Court \nheld that criminal defendants may not be incarcerated for failure to pay old fines \n1 \nunless there is a willful failure to pay. Defendants routinely disregard this clear \nSupreme Court mandate in their overzealous efforts to collect old fines for the \nCity of Gulfport. \n2. \nThe City of Gulfport employs a special force of police officers charged with \ntrolling the streets of Gulfport to round up citizens who have failed to pay fines \nassessed by the Gulfport Municipal Court.  These officers conduct periodic \nsweeps, during which they search the streets for people who look as though they \nmight owe the City old fines.  During these sweeps, the officers go to \npredominately African-American neighborhoods and stop people in the streets \nwithout any legitimate reason, but for the sole purpose of checking to see if they \nowe the City old fines.  Those who owe fines are taken to jail. \n1 \nSe.e Bearden v  Gemgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983) (a court cannot jail an indigent \nprobationer for failure to pay fine unless inquiry reveals willful failure to pay); \nTate v  Shmt, 401 U.S. 395 (1971) (a court cannot convert a fine imposed under a \nfine-only statute into a jail term solely because the defendant cannot immediately \npay the fine in full).  Se.e also Payne v  Mississippi, 462 So.2d 902, 905 (Miss. \n1984) (\"a court may not first fine a defendant and then, because of his indigency, \nconvert the fine into a jail sentence for failure of the defendant to make immediate \npayment of the fine.\"). \n3 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 4 of 57\n3. \nAccused debtors of the City of Gulfport often sit in jail for up to five days \nbefore they come to court.  Once they do see a judge, the hearing typically lasts \nless than one minute; many hearings last no more than thirty seconds.  In violation \noflaw, the judges of the Gulfport Municipal Court routinely fail to inquire into \nwhether the defendant's failure to pay the fine was willful, or the result of the \ndefendant's poverty, illness, or disability.  Unless the defendant can come up with \nthe full amount that he owes or a significant portion thereof, he is sentenced to \"sit \noff' his fines in the Harrison County Jail, at the rate of one day for every $25 \nowed. \n4. \nThrough this pervasive practice, Defendants have caused Plaintiffs \nirreparable injury: to lose jobs, to leave Plaintiffs' children and elderly parents \nwithout the benefit of Plaintiffs' income and support, to miss end-of-term college \nexaminations, and, in one case, to miss an operation to repair a painful and \ndebilitating injury.  Defendants have also cost the citizens of Harrison County \ncountless thousands of dollars in taxes to house these non-violent, impoverished \ndebtors at the county jail. \n4 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 5 of 57\n5. \nIn addition to illegally incarcerating indigent misdemeanants for failure to \npay fines, Defendants routinely violate accused misdemeanants' right to counsel. \nNone of the Plaintiffs, all of whom are indigent, was appointed a public defender \nby the Gulfport Municipal Court.  There are no defense attorneys present at the \nMunicipal Court proceedings conducted by the Harrison County Jail.  The judges \nrarely, if ever, appoint counsel.  Defendants routinely violate the Sixth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution by sentencing indigent \ndefendants to terms of incarceration without first advising them of their right to \ncourt-appointed counsel. \n6. \nDefendants have also denied Plaintiffs access to their own municipal court \nfiles- public records that should be available for any citizen to view.  In violation \nof the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and \nMississippi's Public Records Act, officials of the Gulfport Municipal Court \nrequire payment of a $4. 75  per page \"retrieval fee\" to view public court \ndocuments.  The cost to view nine clients' court files sought in conjunction with \n2 \nIn the last four months, a paralegal for Plaintiffs' counsel has watched \nhundreds of adjudications in the Gulfport Municipal Court.  She has never seen a \nsingle accused misdemeanant represented by an attorney in Municipal Court \nproceedings conducted at the Harrison County Jail.  She has observed .on.e instance \n5 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 6 of 57\nthis case was $513.  This practice is unreasonable, unconscionable, and in \nviolation oflaw. \n7. \nDefendants' policies of incarcerating indigent accused debtors, denying \naccused misdemeanants the right to counsel, and denying Plaintiffs reasonable \naccess to public records violate the First, Sixth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution.  Further, Defendants' practices \nviolate Mississippi laws governing punishment for nonpayment of fines (Miss. \nCode Ann. § 99-37-7, § 99-19-20), adjudication of incompetent persons (Miss. \nCode Ann.§ 99-13-3), and access to public records (Miss. Code Ann.§ 25-61-1, \net. seq.).  Plaintiffs assert claims for violation of their civil rights under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983, violation of Art. 3, § 14 of the Mississippi Constitution, and violation of \nMississippi statutes.  They seek injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment that \nDefendants must conform their actions to the law. \n8. \nDefendants' illegal conduct continues to take place on a near-daily basis and \naffects hundreds of people.  Although some Plaintiffs may be released from the \ncounty jail before the resolution of this lawsuit, Defendants' illegal practices are \nstill a threat to them.  Several Plaintiffs have been arrested repeatedly and jailed for \n( .. continued) \nin which the court appointed counsel. \n6 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 7 of 57\nold fines, in violation of law.  One Plaintiff, Virginia Thomas, has, on five \noccasions, spent over one month in jail for failure to pay old fines.  Plaintiffs seek \nprospective relief so that Defendants will not, in the future, violate their rights. \nDefendants' illegal practices are capable of repetition, yet evading review. \n9. \nPlaintiffs bring this putative class action on behalf of themselves and all \nother indigent persons who are: (1) facing criminal charges in the Gulfport \nMunicipal Court and entitled to court-appointed counsel, (2) currently incarcerated \nby order of the Gulfport Municipal Court for failing to pay old fines, and/or (3) \neligible for arrest by the Gulfport Police Department or its agents for failing to pay \nfines imposed by the Gulfport Municipal Court. \n10. \nPlaintiffs bring this action to compel Defendants to: (a) refrain from \nincarcerating any person for failure to pay fines because of inability to pay; (b) \ninform all accused indigent misdemeanants facing jail or suspended jail sentences \nin the Gulfport Municipal Court of their right to court-appointed counsel; (c) \nprovide counsel for indigent misdemeanants, as required by the United States and \nMississippi Constitutions; and (d) provide misdemeanants and accused \nmisdemeanants reasonable access to their court files. \n7 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 8 of 57\nPARTIES \nPlajntjffs \n11. \nVIRGINIA THOMAS, a 36-year-old African-American woman, is a \nresident of Gulfport, Mississippi.

Ms. \nThomas's sole source of income is a monthly disability check, which she receives \nfrom the federal government because she is too mentally disabled to work.  Since \n1999, Ms. Thomas has been arrested and jailed by the Gulfport police for \"old \nfines\" nine times.  Ms. Thomas was most recently incarcerated for old fines from \nMarch 24, 2005 to June 7, 2005.  The Gulfport Municipal Court judge who \nsentenced Ms. Thomas made no inquiry into her ability to pay before he sentenced \nher to \"work off' her fines in jail.  Ms. Thomas has never been represented by \ncounsel in any proceeding before the Gulfport Municipal Court.  Nor has she been \nadvised that she has the right to court-appointed counsel if she cannot afford to \nhire a lawyer.  Defendants have deprived Ms. Thomas of her liberty without due \nprocess oflaw, denied her the equal protection of the law, and violated her right to \ncounsel.

Ms. Brock is currently incarcerated in the Harrison \nCounty Jail.  After her arrest on June 3, 2005, Ms. Brock appeared before the \nGulfport Municipal Court on June 7 and again on June 9.  She pleaded with the \njudges to be released, explaining that she had surgery scheduled to repair the \nbroken bones in her feet.  The judges did not release her.  Nor did they conduct \nany inquiry into the reasons for her failure to pay the fmes.  Instead, one judge told \nMs. Brock that he would release her if she brought him $1 ,000; otherwise she \nwould have to \"work off' her fines in jail.  Ms. Brock has never been represented \nby a lawyer in the Gulfport Municipal Court.  Defendants have deprived Ms. \nBrock of her liberty without due process oflaw, denied her the equal protection of \nthe laws, and violated her right to counsel.

He was arrested on May 16, 2005 and jailed for two \nweeks even though he had already ''worked off' his fines by doing community \nservice two years earlier.  Due to his two weeks of incarceration, Mr. Riley lost a \njob he had just started eight days before.  In addition, he was unable to care for his \nmother, a 79-year-old woman confined to a wheelchair.  Mr. Riley has never been \nrepresented by counsel in any proceeding before the Gulfport Municipal Court. \nNor has he ever been advised that he has the right to court-appointed counsel if he \ncannot afford to hire a lawyer.

At her court appearance on June 7, 2005, Ms. Lindsey was sentenced \nto 52 days in jail.  She was never advised of her right to counsel.

Code Ann. § 21-23-7(1 ).  The Court holds \n1\nhearings on most weekdays at the Municipal Court building at 2200 15 Street in \nh \nGulfport, Mississippi.  It also holds twice-weekly hearings at the Harrison County \nJail at 10451 Larkin Smith Drive in Gulfport, Mississippi.  The presiding judges of \nthe Gulfport Municipal Court (herein after \"the judges\") are Chief Judge Bill \nAtchison and Judge Richard Smith. \n33. \nThe judges of the Gulfport Municipal Court routinely deny Plaintiffs the \nright to counsel and deprive them of their liberty.  The judges do not inform \ndefendants of their right to court-appointed counsel if they cannot afford to hire \ntheir own attorneys. While Judge Atchison typically informs defendants that they \nhave a right to a lawyer, he usually does so after they have entered a guilty plea. \nJudge Smith, unlike Judge Atchison, gives a brief speech in which he informs \naccused misdemeanants that they have the right to a lawyer, and usually informs \nthem that they have the right to a court-appointed lawyer.  However, many of \ninmates are sitting up to 30 feet away from the judge's bench, and the speech is \n23 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 24 of 57\nbarely audible over the din in the holding cell adjoining the jail courtroom.  This \ninformation is not repeated as each individual defendant comes to the bench. \n34. \nDespite their indigency, none of the Plaintiffs was advised of his or her right \nto court-appointed counsel.  None was given counsel. \n35. \nThe judges of the Gulfport Municipal Court routinely impose hundreds-\nsometimes thousands - of dollars in fines on misdemeanants.  The following are \nsome examples of the fines and costs commonly imposed on misdemeanants: \nPublic intoxication  $152 \nExpired automobile tag  $222 \nSuspended driver's license  $626 \nImproper lane usage  $141 \nProviding a false name  $622 \nNoise violation  $622 \nPossession of drug paraphernalia  $622 \nPublic profanity  $222 \nPossession of marijuana  $372 \nShoplifting (1 51 offense)  $622 \nTrespassing  $327 \n36. \nThe same fine is imposed regardless of the fmancial situation of the \ndefendant.  Thus, a destitute person is fined the same for an expired automobile \ntag as the wealthiest member of the community. \n24 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 25 of 57\n37. \nMany indigent misdemeanants -particularly those charged with driving \nviolations, which can include multiple charges with separate fines -leave Gulfport \nMunicipal Court owing the City well over $1,000.  This is far more than any \nindigent person can pay in a short period of time.  Yet the Gulfport Municipal \nCourt requires that all fines and fees assessed by the Court be paid in full within \nthirty days.  This is simply impossible for some poor people.  Judge Atchison \nroutinely informs misdemeanants that \"payment plans\" are no longer permitted by \nthe Court, and that they will be arrested if they do not pay within thirty days.  He \nalso tells defendants - many of whom are living in poverty - that if they do not \nhave the money, they should \"take out a credit card.\"  Arrest warrants are issued \nfor those who fail to pay in time. \nDefendants' Illegal and JTnetbjca! Fjne-Col!ection Practjces \n38. \nDefendants actively discourage misdemeanants from making installment \npayments toward their fines.  Indigent misdemeanants who attempt to make \ninstallment payments are routinely threatened with jail or jailed.  In one instance, a \nman sent his wife into the Gulfport Municipal Court with a $20 payment.  Officers \ncame out to the car and took the man to jail.  In another instance, relatives of a \nmisdemeanant tried twice to pay $200 towards fines but were turned away because \n25 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 26 of 57\nthe officers would only accept full payment.  The man was later arrested for failure \nto pay fines. \n39. \nThe City of Gulfport employs an \"old fines\" collection squad whose sole \npurpose is to arrest citizens who are late paying their fines.  The City of Gulfport \nalso contracts with a private corporation that is charged with collecting fines that \nare over two years old.  Pursuant to its contract with the City, the private \ncorporation, Haggerty & Associates, Inc., keeps 39% of the money it collects. \n40. \nThe City's fine collection agents employ unconstitutional tactics to collect \nold fines.  These officers conduct periodic sweeps, during which they search the \nstreets for people who might owe the City old fines.  During these sweeps, they go \nto predominately African-American neighborhoods and stop people in the streets \nwithout any legitimate reason, but for the sole purpose of checking to see if they \nowe old fines.  Those who owe old fines are jailed.  One such sweep was \nconducted on June 1, 2005.  About 37 people, including Plaintiff Jacqueline \nLindsey, were arrested and incarcerated for owing old fines on June 1 and June 2, \n2005. \n26 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 27 of 57\n41. \nDefendants also employ other illegal means to coerce misdemeanants into \npaying old fines.  In some cases, people who owe old fines receive a notice in the \nmail to come to Gulfport Municipal Court.  Before court begins, when no judge is \npresent, their names are called by a fine collection officer.  These individuals are \ninstructed to proceed to a back room, where some are handcuffed to a chair.  They \nare told to use the telephone to contact family members or friends to come up with \nthe money they owe.  Those who are unable immediately to produce the money are \ntaken to the Harrison County Jail. \nImprisonment for Inabiljty to Pay Fjnes \n42. \nPeople believed to have failed to pay their fines often sit in jail for up to five \ndays, without counsel, before they are brought before a judge of the Gulfport \nMunicipal Court. \n43. \nThe Gulfport Municipal Court holds hearings at the Jail twice per week. \nThe majority of those present allegedly owe old fines to the City of Gulfport. \nDefendants are called up to the bench one by one for a brief hearing, usually \nlasting less than one minute.  In each case, the municipal judge tells the defendant \nwhat he owes and demands payment of the fine.  Those who have friends or family \n27 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 28 of 57\nwho might have money are often directed to call their friends or family from a \ntelephone at the judge's bench.  Defendants must then beg for money on the \ntelephone in open court- often pleading, in tears, with family members- while \ncourt employees and other arrestees look on. \n44. \nThe judges who conduct these proceedings routinely fail to inquire as to the \ndefendants' ability to pay the fines. \n45. \nWhen accused debtors try to explain their financial circumstances and their \ninability to pay within 30 days, the judges often refuse to permit them to explain \ntheir inability to pay.  In one instance, Judge Atchison threatened to hold a \nhomeless man who appeared to be mentally ill in contempt when he briefly \nprotested that he was too poor to pay.  In another instance, an accused \nmisdemeanant who attempted to ask a question about his old fines was shoved by \nan officer of the Gulfport Municipal Police Department.  The officer told him, in \nopen court that if he asked another question, the officer would \"knock his f------a-\n- out.\" \n46. \nIn the substantial majority of cases, those who cannot raise all of the money \nthey owe are sentenced to a term of incarceration- even though they were not \n28 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 29 of 57\nrepresented by counsel- to \"work off' the old fines.  Pursuant to statute, they are \n3 \nsentenced to one day in jail for every $25 owed. Only rarely does the Court \nconsider any alternate measure of punishment besides imprisonment.  Sometimes, \ndefendants offer $100 or $200- what little they have.  This, generally, will not \nsuffice.  Judge Atchison often tells defendants who owe large fines \"bring me a \ngrand and I'll let you out.\"  Most of these hearings last less than one minute. \n47. \nThe City of Gulfport is facing a financial crisis.  A recent budget report \nstates that the general fund budget contained a $1.4 million operating deficit, on \ninformation and belief.  The City and the judges of the Municipal Court are \nseeking to increase the City's revenue at the expense of the constitutional rights of \nPlaintiffs and other misdemeanants. \n48. \nIn recent months, the City has stepped up its efforts to collect old fines.  On \nJune 11, 2005, Judge Atchison was quoted in the Sun Herald newspaper in an \narticle about the collection of old fines.  He stated that this year has been \"a record \nyear for collecting fines\" in Gulfport.  He further stated: \"From the start of the \nfiscal year in October to June 2, we have collected $1 million.'\"' \n3 See Miss. Code Ann.§ 99-19-20. \n4 \nSee Michael Newsom, \"Unpaid Fines Add Up, But Collecting Them Tough,\" Sun \n29 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 30 of 57\n49. \nThe imprisonment of indigent people for failure to pay fines violates Miss. \nCode Ann.§ 99-19-20(2), which provides that a criminal defendant sentenced to \npay a fine \"may be imprisoned until the fine is paid if the defendant is financially \nable to pay a fine and the court so finds ....\"   (emphasis supplied). \n50. \nThe failure to advise indigent defendants of their right to counsel and the \nfailure to provide counsel violates Miss. Code Ann. § 25-32-9, which provides: \n\"No person determined to be an indigent as provided in this section shall be \nimprisoned as a result of a misdemeanor conviction unless he was represented by \nthe public defender or waived the right to counsel.\" \nImprisonment of the Destitute and Homeless \n51. \nMany of the people sentenced to terms of incarceration for nonpayment of \nfines are completely destitute.  Because the judges do not inquire into the ability of \ndefendants to pay, these factors are not heard or considered by the Court. \n( .. continued) \nHerald, June 11, 2005. \n30 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 31 of 57\n52. \nErica Brock is bone-thin, has severe injuries to her feet, and can barely \nwalk.  In addition, she suffers from serious mental illness and has spent time at \nWhitfield State Mental Hospital.  Despite clear indications that Ms. Brock is not in \na position to pay the $2,000 she allegedly owes to the City, Ms. Brock has been \nrepeatedly incarcerated by the City of Gulfport for failure to pay her old fines. \n53. \nDuring her last incarceration in the jail (November 24- December 20, \n2004), Ms. Brock attempted suicide by jumping off of a top cell tier.  As a result, \nshe shattered the bones in her feet.  Since that incident, Ms. Brock has been unable \nto work, and she has no income. \n54. \nMs. Brock was again arrested for old fines in June 2005.  On June 7, Ms. \nBrock-barely able to walk to the judge's bench- appeared before Judge Smith. \nShe pleaded with the Court to allow her to be released because she had surgery \nscheduled to repair the injuries to her feet.  Judge Smith refused to release her but \nscheduled her to appear before Judge Atchison on June 9. \n55. \nMs. Brock appeared before Judge Atchison on June 9.  She pleaded with the \njudge to let her go, promising to pay the city with her Social Security disability \n31 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 32 of 57\nincome once her application for disability had been approved.  Judge Atchison \nalso refused to release Ms. Brock.  Neither Judge Atchison nor Judge Smith made \nany inquiry into Ms. Brock's ability to pay her fine.  Both judges ignored her pleas \nto release her to receive medical treatment. \n56. \nMs. Brock was not informed of her right to counsel at either hearing.  She \nhas never been represented by a lawyer in the Gulfport Municipal Court. \n57. \nMichael Gay is a 41-year-old Caucasian man.  He is homeless.  On May 6, \n2005, Mr. Gay was asleep in his sleeping bag when he was awakened by police \nofficers, arrested for old fines, littering, and public intoxication, and brought to \njail.  The Gulfport Municipal Court judge who arraigned Mr. Gay did not make \nany inquiry into Mr. Gay's ability to pay his fines or advise him of his right to \ncounsel.  Mr. Gay spent over one month in jail. \n58. \nHubert Lindsey is homeless and unemployed.  He lives in a tent.  Mr. \nLindsey's left eye is clouded and half-shut due to an injury.  He also has a serious \nand visible injury to his left shoulder.  Both of these impairments make it difficult \nfor Mr. Lindsey to find employment.  On July 1, 2005, Mr. Lindsey was stopped \nby the police for \"riding his bicycle without a light.\"  The police then arrested Mr. \n32 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 33 of 57\nLindsey for failure to pay fines and brought him to jail.  Mr. Lindsey appeared \nbefore the Gulfport Municipal Court on July 7.  The presiding judge sentenced Mr. \nLindsey to \"sit out\" $4,780 worth of old fines, without making any inquiry into \nMr. Lindsey's financial situation.  Mr. Lindsey is still in jail. \n59. \nHenry Winters has been homeless for some time, and because of this, had \nbeen sleeping in his family's abandoned house at the time ofhis arrest on May 18, \n2005.  The house does not have gas or water.  Mr. Winters was arrested for old \nfines on May 18 and came before Gulfport Municipal Court Judge Bill Atchison \non May 19.  Although Mr. Winters' physical appearance suggested that he was \nhomeless, Judge Atchison did not ask Mr. Winters any questions.  Instead, Judge \nAtchison told Mr. Winters that he owed the City $1729 and sentenced him to \nnearly one month in jail.  Mr. Winters was not given an opportunity to speak at the \nhearing. \nlmprjgonment of the Mentally 111 and MentaJJy Retarded \n60. \nMany of the people sentenced to terms of incarceration for nonpayment of \nfines are mentally retarded or mentally ill.  Because the judges do not inquire into \nthe ability of defendants to pay, these factors are not heard or considered by the \nCourt.  Mentally ill people, in particular, are repeatedly arrested by the City of \n33 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 34 of 57\nGulfport and incarcerated for failure to pay old fines. \n61. \nPlaintiff Virginia Thomas has been arrested by the Gulfport Police \nDepartment and incarcerated at the Jail for misdemeanors 17 times since 1998.  She \nhas never been informed by the court that she has the right to court-appointed \ncounsel. \n62. \nMs. Thomas is illiterate and mentally retarded.  She is unable even to sign \nher own name. \n63. \nMost recently, Ms. Thomas summoned the Gulfport Police to her residence \non March 24, 2005 after a neighbor threatened her.  When the police arrived, they \ndiscovered  that  Ms.  Thomas  owed old fines.  They brought her to jail.  Ms. \nThomas was not accused of or charged with any wrongdoing in connection with \nthe disagreement with her neighbor but was arrested solely for old fines. \n64. \nMs. Thomas sat in jail for five days without counsel before she had any sort \nof court  hearing  or appearance.  On  or  about  March  29,  2005,  Ms.  Thomas \nappeared before Judge Richard Smith of the Gulfport Municipal Court.  Judge \nSmith did not conduct any inquiry into Ms.  Thomas's ability to pay the  fines. \n34 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 35 of 57\nInstead, he ordered Ms. Thomas confined to jail until she paid off her fines, at a \nrate of$25 per day.  Ms. Thomas spent three months in jail. \n65. \nMs. Thomas has been arrested and incarcerated for old fines on nine \nseparate occasions.  On five of those occasions, she has been held in jail for a \nperiod of more than one month. \n66. \nMs. Thomas has not willfully failed to pay her fines.  She is indigent and \nmentally retarded.  Ms. Thomas lives on a small monthly payment of \nSupplemental Security Income (\"SSI\") provided by the federal government. \nAccording to the Social Security Administration, SSI is a federal income \nsupplement program \"designed to help aged, blind, and disabled people, who have \nlittle or no income.\"  It \"provides cash to meet basic needs for food, clothing, and \n5 \nshelter.\"  Ms. Thomas is unable to pay the money she owes to the City of \nGulfport. \n67. \nClark Crawley, a 64-year-old Caucasian man with paranoid schizophrenia, \nwas arrested by the Long Beach police on March 24, 2005.  He was charged with \n5 \nSee http://www.ssa.gov/notices/supplemental-security-income/. \n35 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 36 of 57\n\"public profanity\" and taken to jail.  Once in custody, it was determined that Mr. \nCrawley owed over $2,000 in old fines to the City of Gulfport.  On March 31, Mr. \nCrawley appeared before Judge Atchison.  Judge Atchison never advised Mr. \nCrawley ofhis right to counsel and told him that he would have to remain in jail to \n\"work off' his fines.  When Mr. Crawley briefly and respectfully protested that he \ncould not afford to pay the fines, Judge Atchison ordered Mr. Crawley to step away \nfrom the bench and told him that if he did not do so, he would be held in contempt. \nMr. Crawley remained in jail for 12 days, in part, because of the old fines he owed. \n68. \nTravis Hudson, a 40-year-old Caucasian man, was arrested for old fines on \nMay 18, 2005.  Mr. Hudson appears to suffer from mental illness and lives in his \ncar.  The court did not make any inquiry into Mr. Hudson's ability to pay or advise \nhim of his right to counsel.  Mr. Hudson spent six days in the jail for old fines.  The \nGulfport police arrested Mr. Hudson again on June 1, charging him with public \nintoxication.  Mr. Hudson is so indigent that he remains in jail on the public \nintoxication charge because he is unable to afford the $15.20 bond fee. \n36 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 37 of 57\nI ,ogs of I Jyelibood \n69. \nDefendants' illegal actions have hanned many people who are barely \neconomically able to provide for themselves and their families. \n70. \nIn May 2005, Plaintiff Steven Riley spent two weeks in jail for old fines. \nAs a result, he lost his job, and his mother, confined to a wheelchair, was left \nalone. \n71. \nMr. Riley was arrested on May 16, 2005, when the Gulfport Police \nDepartment pulled over a car in which Mr. Riley was a passenger.  The police \nplaced him under arrest and brought him to jail.  The only reason for his arrest was \n\"old fines.\" \n72. \nOn May 17, 2005, Mr. Riley appeared before Judge Richard Smith of the \nGulfport Municipal Court.  Mr. Riley told Judge Smith that he had \"worked off' \nhis fines by doing community service in 2002.  He told the judge the name of his \ncommunity service supervisor and told the judge that he had taken his receipt \nverifying completion ofhis hours to the clerk of the Gulfport Municipal Court. \n37 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 38 of 57\nThe court did not inquire about Mr. Riley's financial status or make any \ndetermination about whether his failure to pay fines was willful. \n73. \nMr. Riley remained in the jail for the next two weeks.  He called everyone \nhe could to come up with the money, but he was not able to borrow the $314 he \nsupposedly owed. \n74. \nJust eight days before he was arrested, Mr. Riley had started a new job. \nBecause of his incarceration, he lost his job.  Since then, he has only been able to \nfind part-time work. \n75. \nPlaintiff Timothy Mason was incarcerated at the Harrison County Jail \n\"working off' his old fines from May 12 to June 26, 2005.  Mr. Mason was \narrested by the D'Iberville police on May 11, 2005 after he stole a packet of beef \njerky from Wal-Mart.  On May 12, Mr. Mason pled guilty to shoplifting in \nD'Iberville Municipal Court.  He received a fine of$542 and six months probation. \nMr. Mason remained in jail, however, because of old fines owed to the City of \nGulfport. \n38 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 39 of 57\n76. \nAt the time of his arrest, Mr. Mason was living in a dilapidated trailer with \nno electricity or running water.  He and his family are so poor that at times, he has \nresorted to eating out of garbage dumpsters because he cannot afford food.  As a \nresult of his incarceration, Mr. Mason lost a job he had just started, laying \nsheetrock.  This is the third time Mr. Mason has been arrested for old fines. \n77. \nMr. Mason has never been advised of his right to counsel by the judges of \nthe Municipal Court.  Nor has he ever been represented by counsel in that court. \n78. \nPlaintiff Jacqueline Lindsey has been incarcerated at the Harrison County \nJail for almost two months for being too poor to pay her fines. \n79. \nMs. Lindsey was arrested by the Gulfport Police while walking home from a \nrestaurant on June 1, 2005.  The officers who approached Ms. Lindsey asked her \nname and told her to wait while they checked to see if she owed fines.  Because \nMs. Lindsey owed old fines, she was taken to jail. \n80. \nNearly one week later, Ms. Lindsey appeared before Judge Smith and was \nnever advised of her right to counsel.  Ms. Lindsey was permitted to call her uncle \n39 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 40 of 57\nfrom the telephone at the judge's bench.  In open court, with court staff and a \nroom full of inmates looking on, Ms. Lindsey pleaded with her uncle to bring her \nthe money she owed, promising to sell her car to pay him back.  Unable to come \nup with the money, Ms. Lindsey was sentenced to 52 days in jail. \n81. \nJudge Smith did not conduct any inquiry into Ms. Lindsey's background or \nfinancial circumstances before he sentenced her to nearly two months in jail.  If he \nhad, he would have known that Ms. Lindsey was too poor to pay her fines. \nAlthough she has worked pressing clothes at Exclusive Cleaners for the last two \nyears, she makes barely above minimum wage.  Due to her incarceration, Ms. \nLindsey's employer had to hire someone else to fill her position.  When she is \nreleased from jail, she will be without a job.  She has lost her only source of \nmcome. \n82. \nLeo Benoit, a 36-year-old African-American man, was riding his bicycle \nhome after working the night shift at Burger King - wearing his Burger King \nuniform and visor- when the Long Beach Police stopped him.  The police told \nhim that they stopped him for \"riding a bicycle without a light.\"  The police then \n\"ran\" Mr. Benoit's name and found that he owed $406 in old fines to Long Beach \nand $355 to Gulfport.  Mr. Benoit spent thirteen days in jail.  The Gulfport \n40 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 41 of 57\nMunicipal Court did not conduct any inquiry into Mr. Benoit's ability to pay the \nfine or advise him of his right to counsel.  Mr. Benoit is having a difficult time \nsupporting his two children under the age of two on his salary from Burger King. \nHis thirteen days in jail deprived his family of two weeks of his income. \n83. \nDefendants' fine collection practices are illegal and unconstitutional. \nDefendants have no authority to incarcerate indigent defendants who are unable to \npay all of their fines.  They certainly have no legal authority to keep them in jail \nfor months for the sole reason that they are too poor, and/or mentally, or physically \ndisabled to pay fines. \nIllegal Obstruction of Plaintiffs' Right to View Public Court Documents \n84. \nOfficials of the Gulfport Municipal Court deny Plaintiffs and others \nsimilarly situated access to court files regarding their cases in violation of the First \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Mississippi's \nPublic Records Act. \n85. \nIn accordance with the policy of the Gulfport Municipal Court, the \nundersigned counsel submitted a written request to view the court files of nine of \n41 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 42 of 57\ntheir clients.  The Gulfport Municipal Court charged Plaintiffs' counsel a $4.75 per \npage \"retrieval fee\" for the files.  Court Administrator Bill Markopoulos insisted \nthat the $513 bill be paid in full before counsel would be permitted to see their \nclients' files.  The $4.75 per page \"retrieval fee\" bears no relation to the fee \nschedule posted in the Municipal Court Clerk's office. \n86. \nThe Mississippi Public Records Act states that \"public records must be \navailable for inspection by any person unless otherwise provided [by the Act],\" and \n\"providing access to public records is a duty of each public body.\"  Miss. Code \nAnn. § 25-61-1.  The Act permits a public body to charge \"fees reasonably \ncalculated to reimburse it for, and in no case to exceed, the actual cost of \nsearching\" for records. \n87. \nDefendant Markopoulos and other Municipal Court officials have violated \nthe Public Records Act and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution by charging excessive fees, charging fees that bear no relation \nto the actual cost of retrieving files, and purposely obstructing Plaintiffs from \naccess to public records. \n42 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 43 of 57\nCI,ASS ACTION AJ.LEGATIONS \n88. \nPlaintiffs bring this class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure on their behalf and on behalf of a class similarly situated \nand affected during the pendency of this lawsuit and in the future.  The class is \ndefined as all indigent persons who are: (1) facing criminal charges in the Gulfport \nMunicipal Court and entitled to court-appointed counsel, (2) currently incarcerated \nby order of the Gulfport Municipal Court for failing to pay old fines, and/or (3) \neligible for arrest by Gulfport City Police or their agents for failing to pay fines \nimposed by the Gulfport Municipal Court. \n89. \nThe members of this class are so numerous that their joinder is impractical. \nThousands of accused misdemeanants come before the Gulfport Municipal Court \neach year.  There are currently over 100 misdemeanants at the Harrison County \nJail- a facility that is already severely overcrowded.  The majority of these \nmisdemeanants are awaiting adjudication by the Gulfport Municipal Court or \nserving sentences imposed by the Court.  The practices of the Municipal Court are \ncapable of repetition yet evading review, and this is best addressed in a class \naction.  On information and belief, there are hundreds more people who are \nindigent and owe old fines, who if arrested will be subject to incarceration for \n43 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 44 of 57\nfailure to pay. \n90. \nThe policies and practices challenged in this action apply with equal force \nto the named Plaintiffs and all members of the class so that the claims of the \nnamed Plaintiffs are typical of those of the class.  All class members are current or \nfuture defendants in the Gulfport Municipal Court.  Class members have been or \nwill be, absent this Court's intervention, deprived of the right to liberty without \ndue process oflaw upon any alleged failure to pay.  All class members will \ncontinue to be subject to such conditions absent the requested relief. \n91. \nThe named Plaintiffs will fairly represent and adequately protect the \ninterests of the class as a whole.  They possess the requisite personal interest in the \nsubject matter of the lawsuit and possess no interests adverse to other class \nmembers.  Plaintiffs are representative of the class of all persons who are: (1) \nfacing criminal charges in the Gulfport Municipal Court and entitled to court \nappointed counsel, (2) currently incarcerated by order of the Gulfport Municipal \nCourt for failing to pay old fines, and/or (3) eligible for arrest by Gulfport City \nPolice or their agents for failing to pay fines imposed by the Gulfport Municipal \nCourt. \n44 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 45 of 57\n92. \nPlaintiffs are represented by counsel who are experienced in class action \nlitigation involving the rights of indigent criminal defendants.  The named \nPlaintiffs and the class members are represented by attorneys at the Southern \nCenter for Human Rights, a privately funded, nonprofit organization with \nextensive experience in complex class action litigation including litigation \nchallenging the provision of indigent defense, as well as by attorneys at the \nNAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., a civil rights organization \ndedicated to enforcing the rights of African-Americans.  Plaintiffs are also \nrepresented by Robert McDuff, an attorney based in Jackson, Mississippi, with \nextensive experience as a civil rights litigator.  Plaintiffs' counsel have the \nresources, expertise, and experience to effectively prosecute this action. \n93. \nThe questions of fact and law common to the class as a whole concerning \nthe constitutionality and lawfulness of each of the following of Defendants' \npolicies and practices are: \n(a)  the failure to provide counsel to people accused of misdemeanors \nwho may be deprived of their liberty for failure to pay fines in 30 days; \n(b)  the practice of imposing fines without a determination of defendants' \nability to pay; \n45 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 46 of 57\n(c)  the policy and practice of summoning people to court, handcuffing \nthem to a chair in a back office, and directing them to contact friends and \nfamily to come up with the money they owe; \n(d)  the policy and practice of requiring people who cannot afford to pay \nfines to \"work off' their fines at $25 per day in jail; \n(e)  the policy and practice of failing to inform defendants of the right to \ncourt-appointed counsel in cases resulting in jail or suspended jail \nsentences; \n(f)  the policy and practice of jailing persons who exhibit signs of serious \nmental illness without any determination of competency. \n94. \nDefendants, in creating and enforcing the policies regarding provision of \ncounsel and fine collection, have acted in a way generally applicable to the class \nthe Plaintiffs represent, thereby making preliminary and permanent injunctive \nrelief and corresponding declaratory relief appropriate for the class as a whole \npursuant to Rule 23(b) (2). \n46 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 1   Filed 07/21/05   Page 47 of 57\nCI.AJMS FOR REI.IEF \nCOUNT ONE \nDENIAl.

In support thereof, Plaintiffs respectfully \nstate as follows: \nPREUMINARY STATEMENT \n1. \nThis is an action to stop Defendants, the City of Gulfport and the Judges of \nthe Gulfport Municipal Court, from an abuse of their authority, through which \nthey have been imprisoning indigent misdemeanants for nonpayment of fines in \ntotal disregard for the law.  Due to the actions of Defendants, the Harrison County \nJail in Gulfport, Mississippi has become a modem day debtors' prison.  The jail is \n2 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 3 of 63\npacked with indigent men and women serving sentences for failure to pay \"old \nfines.\"  Many of these people are completely destitute.  Some are also mentally ill, \nmentally retarded, and/or physically disabled.  They are unable to pay the fines \nimposed upon them.  Over three decades ago, the United States Supreme Court \nheld that criminal defendants may not be incarcerated for failure to pay old fines \nunless there is a willful failure to pay. 1  Defendants routinely disregard this clear \nSupreme Court mandate in their efforts to collect old fines for the City of Gulfport. \n2. \nThe City of Gulfport employs a special force of police officers charged with \npatrolling the streets of Gulfport to arrest citizens who have failed to pay fines \nassessed by the Gulfport Municipal Court.  These officers conduct periodic \nsweeps, during which they search the streets for people who look as though they \nmight owe the City old fines.  During these sweeps, the officers go to \npredominately African-American neighborhoods and stop people in the streets \n1 See Bearden v  Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983) (a court cannot jail an indigent \nprobationer for failure to pay fine unless inquiry reveals willful failure to pay); \nTate v  Short, 401 U.S. 395 (1971) (a court cannot convert a fine imposed under a \nfine-only statute into a jail term solely because the defendant cannot immediately \npay the fine in full).  See aJ.so Payne v  Mississippi, 462 So.2d 902, 905 (Miss. \n1984) (\"a court may not first fine a defendant and then, because of his indigency, \nconvert the fine into a jail sentence for failure of the defendant to make immediate \npayment of the fine.\"). \n3 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 4 of 63\nwithout any independent reason or suspicion, but for the sole purpose of checking \nto see if they owe the City old fines.  Those who owe fines are taken to jail. \n3. \nAccused debtors of the City of Gulfport often sit in jail for up to five days \nbefore they are brought before the court.  Once they do see a judge, the hearing \ntypically lasts less than one minute; many hearings last no more than thirty \nseconds.  In violation oflaw, the judges of the Gulfport Municipal Court routinely \nfail to inquire into whether the defendant's failure to pay the fine was willful, or \nthe result of the defendant's poverty, illness, or disability.  Unless the defendant \ncan come up with the full amount that he owes or a significant portion thereof, he \nis sentenced to \"sit off' his fines in the Harrison County Jail, at the rate of one day \nfor every $25 owed. \n4. \nThrough this pervasive practice, Defendants have caused Plaintiffs \nirreparable injury: to lose jobs, to leave Plaintiffs' children and elderly parents \nwithout the benefit of Plaintiffs' income and support, to miss end-of-term college \nexaminations, and, in one case, to miss an operation to repair a painful and \ndebilitating injury.  Defendants have also cost the citizens of Harrison County \ncountless thousands of dollars in taxes to house these non-violent, impoverished \ndebtors at the county jail. \n4 \n\n-, \nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 5 of 63\n5. \nIn addition to illegally incarcerating indigent misdemeanants for failure to \npay fines, Defendants routinely violate accused misdemeanants' right to counsel. \nNo counsel was ever appointed to any of the Plaintiffs, all of whom are indigent, \nwhen they appeared as defendants before the Gulfport Municipal Court.  There are \nno defense attorneys present at the Municipal Court proceedings conducted by the \nHarrison County Jail.  The judges rarely, if ever, appoint counsel.  Defendants \nroutinely violate the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution by sentencing indigent defendants to terms of incarceration without \nfirst advising them of their right to court-appointed counsel. \n6. \nDefendants have also denied Plaintiffs access to their own municipal court \nfiles- public records that should be available for any citizen to view.  In violation \nof the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and \nMississippi's Public Records Act, officials of the Gulfport Municipal Court \nrequire payment of a $4. 75  per page \"retrieval fee\" to view public court \ndocuments.  The cost to view nine clients' court files sought in conjunction with \nthis case was $513.  This practice is unreasonable, unconscionable, and in \nviolation oflaw. \n5 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 6 of 63\n7. \nDefendants keep inadequate records of proceedings before the GulfPort \nMunicipal Court.  As a consequence, some Plaintiffs have been forced to serve \nmore than one term of incarceration for an alleged failure to pay the same fines. \n8. \nDefendants' policies of incarcerating indigent accused debtors, denying \naccused misdemeanants the right to counsel, and denying Plaintiffs reasonable \naccess to public records violate the First, Sixth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution.  Further, Defendants' practices \nviolate Mississippi laws governing punishment for nonpayment of fines (Miss. \nCode Ann. § 99-3 7-7, § 99-19-20) , adjudication of incompetent persons (Miss. \nCode Ann. § 99-13-3), and access to public records (Miss. Code Ann. § 25-61-1, \net. seq.).  Plaintiffs assert claims for violation of their civil rights under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983, violation of Art. 3, § 14 of the Mississippi Constitution, and violation of \nMississippi statutes.  They seek injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment that \nDefendants must conform their actions to the law. \n9. \nDefendants' illegal conduct continues to take place on a near-daily basis and \naffects hundreds of people.  Although some Plaintiffs may be released from the \ncounty jail before the resolution of this lawsuit, Defendants' illegal practices are \n6 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 7 of 63\nstill a threat to them.  Several Plaintiffs have been arrested repeatedly and jailed for \nold fines, in violation oflaw.  One Plaintiff, Virginia Thomas, has, on five \noccasions, spent over one month in jail for failure to pay old fines.  Plaintiffs seek \nprospective relief so that Defendants will not, in the future, violate their rights. \nDefendants' illegal practices are capable of repetition, yet evading review. \n10. \nPlaintiffs bring this putative class action on behalf of themselves and all \nother indigent persons who are: (1) facing criminal charges in the Gulfport \nMunicipal Court and entitled to court-appointed counsel, (2) currently incarcerated \nby order of the Gulfport Municipal Court for failing to pay old fines, and/or (3) \neligible for arrest by the Gulfport Police Department or its agents for failing to pay \nfines imposed by the Gulfport Municipal Court. \n11. \nPlaintiffs bring this action to compel Defendants to: (a) conduct an inquiry \ninto a person's ability to pay old fines owed or the reasons for non-payment and \nrefrain from incarcerating any person for failure to pay fines because of inability to \npay; (b) inform all accused indigent misdemeanants facing jail or suspended jail \nsentences in the Gulfport Municipal Court of their right to court-appointed \ncounsel; (c) provide counsel for indigent misdemeanants, as required by the \nUnited States and Mississippi Constitutions; and (d) provide misdemeanants and \n7 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 8 of 63\naccused misdemeanants reasonable access to their court files. \nPARTIES \nPlajutiffs \n12. \nVIRGINIA THOMAS, a 36-year-old African-American woman, is a \nresident of GulfPort, Mississippi.  She is illiterate and mentally retarded.  Ms. \nThomas's sole source of income is a monthly disability check, which she receives \nfrom the federal government because she is too mentally disabled to work.  Since \n1999, Ms. Thomas has been arrested and jailed by the GulfPort police for \"old \nfines\" nine times.  Ms. Thomas was most recently incarcerated for old fines from \nMarch 24, 2005 to June 7, 2005.  Given her indigence and consistent inability to \npay old fines in the past, Ms. Thomas is in danger of being arrested again and \nincarcerated because ofher indigence.  The GulfPort Municipal Court judge who \nsentenced Ms. Thomas made no inquiry into her ability to pay before he sentenced \nher to \"work off' her fines in jail.  Ms. Thomas has never been represented by \ncounsel in any proceeding before the GulfPort Municipal Court.  Nor has she been \nadvised that she has the right to court-appointed counsel if she cannot afford to \nhire a lawyer.  Defendants have deprived Ms. Thomas of her liberty without due \nprocess oflaw, denied her the equal protection of the law, and violated her right to \n8 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 9 of 63\ncounsel.  Ms. Thomas seeks the enforcement of her rights in this Court so that she \nwill not be subject to further unconstitutional deprivations of her liberty. \n13. \nERIKA BROCK, a 34-year-old African-American woman, is a resident of \nGulfport, Mississippi.  Ms. Brock is mentally ill and can barely walk due to \ninjuries she sustained in a suicide attempt in December 2004.  Her disabilities are \napparent.  Despite clear indications that Ms. Brock is not in a position to pay the \n$2,000 she allegedly owes the City of Gulfport, Ms. Brock has been repeatedly \nincarcerated by the City of Gulfport for failure to pay.  Ms. Brock is currently \nincarcerated in the Harrison County Jail.  After her arrest on June 3, 2005, Ms. \nBrock appeared before the Gulfport Municipal Court on June 7 and again on June \n9.  She pleaded with the judges to be released, explaining that she was scheduled \nto have surgery to repair the broken bones in her feet.  The judges did not release \nher.  Nor did they conduct any inquiry into the reasons for her failure to pay the \nfines.  Instead, one judge told Ms. Brock that he would release her if she produced \n$1,000; otherwise she would have to \"work off' her fines in jail.  Ms. Brock has \nnever been represented by a lawyer in the Gulfport Municipal Court.  Defendants \nhave deprived Ms. Brock of her liberty without due process oflaw, denied her the \nequal protection of the laws, and violated her right to counsel.

Due to his two weeks of incarceration, Mr. Riley lost a \njob he had just started eight days before.  In addition, he was unable to care for his \nmother, a 79-year-old woman confined to a wheelchair.  Mr. Riley has never been \nrepresented by counsel in any proceeding before the Gulfport Municipal Court. \nNor has he ever been advised that he has the right to court-appointed counsel if he \ncannot afford to hire a lawyer.

The \nofficers who approached Ms. Lindsey asked her name and told her to wait while \nthey checked their database to see if she owed fines.  She did.  Because Ms. \nLindsey could not come up with the full amount she owed on the spot, Ms. \nLindsey was taken to jail.  Ms. Lindsey sat in the jail for nearly a week before she \nsaw a judge.  At her court appearance on June 7, 2005, Ms. Lindsey was sentenced \n11 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 12 of 63\nto 52 days in jail.

At his court hearing, on or around April 14, \n2005, Mr. White pled guilty and was assessed a fine in the amount of over $1200, \nput on probation, and required to take a victim impact class.  Given Mr. White's \nfinancial circumstances, the presiding judge gave Mr. White six months to pay his \nfines.  Thereafter, Mr. White complied with all orders of the court.  He paid a $151 \nvictim impact class fee, completed the four week victim impact course, and paid a \nprobation fee of$75.  On two occasions, Mr. White reported to the Gulfport \nMunicipal Court with $200 to pay his fine.  He came up with the $200 by selling \nbaseball cards.

On the second \noccasion, on July 1, 2005, Mr. White presented $200 and proof of insurance to a \nGulfport Municipal Court clerk for payment.  Disregarding the Court's order \ngiving him six months to pay his fine, the clerk told Mr. White that he would need \nto pay the entire $1200 that day or go to jail.  A warrants officer then arrested Mr. \nWhite and led him to a room behind the courtroom.  The officer instructed Mr. \nWhite to call friends or family members to come up with the $1200.

Mr. Hatten tried to explain his financial circumstances, but \nJudge Atchison cut him off, stating \"You're lying like a dog.\"  Judge Atchison then \nthreatened to hold Mr. Hatten in contempt if he said anything else.  On August 5, \n2005, after an employer for whom Mr. Hatten performs odd jobs intervened, the \ncourt agreed to release Mr. Hatten if he would pay down his old fines at a rate of \n$250 per month.  Mr. Hatten's disability, low income and inconsistent employment \nrender his ability to meet the terms of his payment plan unlikely.

BACKGROUND \n37. \nThe Gulfport Municipal Court exercises jurisdiction over defendants \naccused of \"violating municipal ordinances and state misdemeanor laws made \noffenses against the municipality.\"  Miss. Code Ann. § 21-23-7(1 ).  The Court \n1\nholds hearings on most weekdays at the Municipal Court building at 2200 15\nh \nStreet in Gulfport, Mississippi.  It also holds twice-weekly hearings at the \nHarrison County Jail at 10451 Larkin Smith Drive in Gulfport, Mississippi.  The \npresiding judges of the Gulfport Municipal Court (herein after \"the judges\") are \nChief Judge Bill Atchison and Judge Richard Smith. \n38. \nThe judges of the Gulfport Municipal Court routinely deny Plaintiffs the \nright to counsel and deprive them of their liberty.  The judges fail to inform \ndefendants of their right to court-appointed counsel if they cannot afford to hire \ntheir own attorneys.  Judge Atchison informs defendants that they have a right to a \nlawyer only after they have entered a guilty plea.  Judge Smith, unlike Judge \nAtchison, gives a brief speech at the beginning of daily proceedings in which he \ninforms accused misdemeanants that they have the right to a lawyer, and usually \ninforms them that they have the right to a court-appointed lawyer.  However, \nJudge Smith makes no effort to insure that the defendants hear or understand  their \n28 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 29 of 63\nright to court-appointed counsel, and Judge Smith does not repeat notice of the \nright to court-appointed counsel as each individual defendant approaches the \nbench. \n39. \nDespite their indigency, none of the Plaintiffs was advised of his or her right \nto court-appointed counsel.  None was given counsel. \n40. \nThe judges of the Gulfport Municipal Court routinely impose hundreds -\nsometimes thousands - of dollars in fines on misdemeanants.  The following are \nsome examples of the fines and costs commonly imposed on misdemeanants: \nPublic intoxication  $152 \nExpired automobile tag  $222 \nSuspended driver's license  $626 \nImproper lane usage  $141 \nProviding a false name  $622 \nNoise violation  $622 \nPossession of drug paraphernalia  $622 \nPublic profanity  $222 \nPossession of marijuana  $372 \nShoplifting ( 1' 1 offense)  $622 \nTrespassing  $327 \n41. \nThe same fine is imposed regardless of the financial situation of the \ndefendant. \n29 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 30 of 63\n42. \nMany indigent misdemeanants -particularly those charged with driving \nviolations, which often include multiple charges with separate fines - leave \nGulfport Municipal Court owing the City well over $1,000.  The Gulfport \nMunicipal Court requires that all fines and fees assessed by the Court be paid in \nfull within thirty days.  This payment schedule is infeasible for indigent \ndefendants.  Judge Atchison routinely informs misdemeanants that \"payment \nplans\" are no longer permitted by the Court, and that they will be arrested if they \ndo not pay within thirty days.  He also advises indigent defendants that if they do \nnot have the cash to pay the fines, they should \"take out a credit card.\"  Arrest \nwarrants are issued for those who fail to pay within the thirty days. \nDefendants' Illegal Fjne-Collectjon practjces \n43. \nDefendants actively discourage indigent misdemeanants from making \ninstallment payments toward their fines.  Indigent misdemeanants who attempt to \nmake installment payments are routinely threatened with jail or jailed.  In one \ninstance, a man sent his wife into the Gulfport Municipal Court with a $20 \npayment while he waited in the car.  Officers came out to the car and took the man \nto jail.  In another instance, relatives of a misdemeanant tried twice to pay $200 \ntowards fines but were turned away because the officers would only accept full \n30 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 31 of 63\npayment.  The man was later arrested for failure to pay his fines. \n44. \nThe City of Gulfport employs an \"old fines\" collection squad whose sole \npurpose is to arrest citizens who owe old fines.  The City of Gulfport also \ncontracts with a private corporation that is charged with collecting fines that are \nover two years old.  Pursuant to its contract with the City, the private corporation, \nHaggerty & Associates, Inc., keeps 39% of the money it collects. \n45. \nThe City's fine collection agents employ unconstitutional tactics to collect \nold fines.  These officers conduct periodic sweeps, during which they search the \nstreets for people who might owe the City old fines.  During these sweeps, they go \nto predominately African-American neighborhoods and stop people in the streets \nwithout probable cause or reasonable suspicion, but for the sole purpose of \nchecking to see if they owe old fines.  Those who owe old fines are jailed.  One \nsuch sweep was conducted on June 1, 2005.  As a result, approximately 3 7 people, \nincluding Plaintiff Jacqueline Lindsey, were arrested and incarcerated for owing \nold fines on June 1 and June 2, 2005. \n46. \nDefendants also employ other illegal means to coerce misdemeanants into \npaying old fines.  In some cases, people who owe old fines receive a notice in the \n31 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 32 of 63\nmail summoning them to Gulfport Municipal Court.  Before court begins, when no \njudge is present, their names are called by a fine collection officer.  These \nindividuals are instructed to proceed to a back room, where some are handcuffed \nto a chair.  They are told to use the telephone to contact family members or friends \nto come up with the money they owe.  Those who are unable immediately to \nproduce the money are taken to the Harrison County Jail. \nImprjsonment for Inability to Pay Fines \n47. \nPeople believed to have failed to pay their fines often wait in jail for up to \nfive days, without counsel, before they are brought before a judge of the Gulfport \nMunicipal Court. \n48. \nThe Gulfport Municipal Court holds hearings at the Jail twice per week. \nThe majority of those present allegedly owe old fines to the City of Gulfport. \nDefendants are called up to the bench one by one for a brief hearing, usually \nlasting less than one minute.  In each case, the municipal judge tells the defendant \nwhat he owes and demands payment of the fine.  Those who have friends or family \nwho might have money are often directed to call their friends or family from a \ntelephone at the judge's bench in open court while court employees and other \narrestees look on. \n32 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 33 of 63\n49. \nThe judges who conduct these proceedings routinely fail to inquire as to the \nmisdemeanants' ability to pay the fines. \n50. \nWhen accused debtors try to explain their financial circumstances and their \ninability to pay within the court's prescribed 30 days, the judges often refuse to \npermit them to explain their inability to pay.  In one instance, Judge Atchison \nthreatened to hold a homeless man who appeared to be mentally ill in contempt \nwhen he briefly protested that he was too poor to pay.  In another instance, an \naccused misdemeanant who attempted to ask a question about his old fines was \nshoved by an officer of the Gulfport Municipal Police Department.  The officer \ntold him, in open court that if he asked another question, the officer would \"knock \nhI.S  f ------ a-- out. \" \n51. \nIn the substantial majority of cases, those who cannot raise all of the money \nthey owe are sentenced to a term of incarceration - even though they have not \nbeen represented by counsel - to \"work off' the old fines.  Pursuant to statute, \nthey are sentenced to one day in jail for every $25 owed.Z  Only rarely does the \nCourt consider any alternate measure of punishment besides imprisonment. \n33 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 34 of 63\nSometimes, defendants offer what little cash they have.  This, generally, will not \nsuffice.  Judge Atchison often tells defendants who owe large fines ''bring me a \ngrand and I'll let you out.\"  Most of these hearings last less than one minute. \n52. \nThe City of Gulfport is facing a financial crisis.  A recent budget report \nstates that the general fund budget contained a $1.4 million operating deficit.  On \ninformation and belief, the City and the judges of the Municipal Court are seeking \nto increase the City's revenue at the expense of the constitutional rights of \nPlaintiffs and other misdemeanants.  As such, the judges are acting in an \nadministrative capacity on behalf of the City to implement the old fines policy. \n53. \nOn information and belief, in recent months, the City has stepped up its \nefforts to collect old fines.  On June 11, 2005, Judge Atchison was quoted in the \nSun Herald newspaper in an article about the collection of old fines.  He stated \nthat this year has been \"a record year for collecting fines\" in Gulfport.  He further \nstated: \"From the start of the fiscal year in October to June 2, we have collected $1 \n3 \nmillion.\"\n54. \n( .. continued) \n2 \nSee Miss.

Code Ann. § 25-32-9, which provides: \n\"No person determined to be an indigent as provided in this section shall be \nimprisoned as a result of a misdemeanor conviction unless he was represented by \nthe public defender or waived the right to counsel.\" \nImprisonment of the Destjtute and Homeless \n56. \nMany of the people sentenced to terms of incarceration for nonpayment of \nfines are without any assets and live on little or no income.  Because the judges do \nnot inquire into the ability of defendants to pay, these factors are not heard or \nconsidered by the Court. \n57. \n( .. continued) \nHerald, June 11, 2005. \n35 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 36 of 63\nErica Brock is impaired because of severe injuries to her feet.  In addition, \nshe suffers from serious mental illness and has spent time at Whitfield State \nMental Hospital.  Despite clear indications that Ms. Brock is not in a position to \npay the $2,000 she allegedly owes to the City, Ms. Brock has been repeatedly \nincarcerated by the City of Gulfport for failure to pay her old fines. \n58. \nDuring her last incarceration in the jail (November 24 -December 20, \n2004), Ms. Brock attempted suicide by jumping off of a top cell tier.  As a result, \nshe shattered the bones in her feet.  Since that incident, Ms. Brock has been unable \nto work, and she has no income. \n59. \nMs. Brock was again arrested for old fines in June 2005.  On June 7, Ms. \nBrock appeared before Judge Smith.  She pleaded with the Court to allow her to be \nreleased because she had surgery scheduled to repair the injuries to her feet.  Judge \nSmith refused to release her but scheduled her to appear before Judge Atchison on \nJune 9. \n60. \nMs. Brock appeared before Judge Atchison on June 9.  She pleaded with the \njudge to let her go, promising to pay the city with her Social Security disability \nincome once her application for disability had been approved.  Judge Atchison \n36 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 37 of 63\nalso refused to release Ms. Brock.  Neither Judge Atchison nor Judge Smith made \nany inquiry into Ms. Brock's ability to pay her fine.  Both judges ignored her pleas \nto release her to receive medical treatment. \n61. \nMs. Brock was not informed of her right to counsel at either hearing.  She \nhas never been represented by a lawyer in the Gulfport Municipal Court. \n62. \nMichael Gay is a 41-year-old Caucasian man.  He is homeless.  On May 6, \n2005, Mr. Gay was asleep in his sleeping bag when he was awakened by police \nofficers, arrested for old fines, littering, and public intoxication, and brought to \njail.  The Gulfport Municipal Court judge who arraigned Mr. Gay did not make \nany inquiry into Mr. Gay's ability to pay his fines or advise him of his right to \ncounsel.  Mr. Gay spent over one month in jail. \n63. \nHubert Lindsey is homeless and unemployed.  He lives in a tent.  Mr. \nLindsey's left eye is clouded and half-shut due to an injury.  He also has a serious \nand visible injury to his left shoulder.  Both of these impairments have limited Mr. \nLindsey's ability to work.  On July 1, 2005, Mr. Lindsey was stopped by the police \nfor \"riding his bicycle without a light.\"  The police then arrested Mr. Lindsey for \nfailure to pay fines and took him to jail.  Mr. Lindsey appeared before the Gulfport \n37 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 38 of 63\nMunicipal Court on July 7.  The presiding judge sentenced Mr. Lindsey to \"sit \nout\" $4,780 worth of old fines, without making any inquiry into Mr. Lindsey's \nindigence or ability to pay these fines.  Mr. Lindsey is still in jail. \n64. \nHenry Winters has been homeless for some time, and because of this, had \nbeen sleeping in an abandoned house at the time ofhis arrest on May 18, 2005. \nThe house does not have gas or water.  Mr. Winters was arrested for old fines on \nMay 18 and came before Gulfport Municipal Court Judge Bill Atchison on May \n19.  Although Mr. Winters's physical appearance suggested that he was indigent, \nJudge Atchison did not ask Mr. Winters any questions.  Instead, Judge Atchison \ntold Mr. Winters that he owed the City $1729 and sentenced him to nearly one \nmonth in jail.  Mr. Winters was not given an opportunity to speak at the hearing. \nImprisonment of the Mentally Ill and Mentally Retarded \n65. \nMany of the people sentenced to terms of incarceration for nonpayment of \nfines are mentally retarded or mentally ill.  Because the judges do not inquire into \nthe ability of defendants to pay, these factors are not heard or considered by the \nCourt.  Mentally ill people, in particular, are repeatedly arrested by the City of \nGulfport and incarcerated for failure to pay old fines. \n38 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 39 of 63\n66. \nPlaintiff Virginia Thomas has been arrested by the Gulfport Police Department \nand incarcerated at the Jail for misdemeanors 17 times since 1998.  She has never \nbeen informed by the court that she has the right to court-appointed counsel. \n67. \nMs. Thomas is illiterate and mentally retarded.  She is unable even to sign \nher own name. \n68. \nMost recently, Ms. Thomas summoned the Gulfport Police to her residence \non March 24, 2005 after a neighbor threatened her.  When the police arrived, they \ndiscovered that Ms. Thomas owed old fines.  They took her to jail.  Ms. Thomas \nwas not accused of or charged with any wrongdoing in connection with the \ndisagreement with her neighbor but was arrested solely for old fines. \n69. \nMs. Thomas sat in jail for five days without counsel before she appeared \nbefore the court.  On or about March 29, 2005, Ms. Thomas appeared before Judge \nRichard Smith of the Gulfport Municipal Court.  Judge Smith did not conduct any \ninquiry into Ms. Thomas's ability to pay the fines.  Instead, he ordered Ms. \nThomas confined to jail until she paid off her fines, at a rate of $25 per day.  As a \nresult, Ms. Thomas spent three months in jail. \n39 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 40 of 63\n70. \nMs. Thomas has been arrested and incarcerated for old fines on nine \nseparate occasions.  On five of those occasions, she has been held in jail for a \nperiod of more than one month. \n71. \nMs. Thomas has not willfully failed to pay her fines.  She is indigent and \nmentally retarded.  Ms. Thomas lives on a small monthly payment of \nSupplemental Security Income (\"SSI\") provided by the federal government. \nAccording to the Social Security Administration, SSI is a federal income \nsupplement program \"designed to help aged, blind, and disabled people, who have \nlittle or no income.\"  It \"provides cash to meet basic needs for food, clothing, and \n4 \nshelter.\"  Ms. Thomas is unable to pay the money she owes to the City of \nGulfport. \n72. \nClark Crawley: a 64-year-old Caucasian man with paranoid schizophrenia, \nwas arrested by the Long Beach police on March 24, 2005.  He was charged with \n\"public profanity\" and taken to jail.  Once in custody, it was determined that Mr. \nCrawley owed over $2,000 in old fines to the City of Gulfport.  On March 31, Mr. \n4 \nSee http://www.ssa.gov/notices/supplemental-security-income/. \n40 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 41 of 63\nCrawley appeared before Judge Atchison.  Judge Atchison never advised Mr. \nCrawley of his right to counsel and told him that he would have to remain in jail to \n\"work off' his fines.  When Mr. Crawley informed the court that he could not \nafford to pay the fines, Judge Atchison ordered Mr. Crawley to step away from the \nbench and told him that if he did not do so, he would be held in contempt.  Mr. \nCrawley remained in jail for 12 days, in part, because of the old fines he owed. \n73. \nTravis Hudson, a 40-year-old Caucasian man, was arrested for old fines on \nMay 18, 2005.  Mr. Hudson appears to suffer from mental illness and lives in his \ncar.  The court did not make any inquiry into Mr. Hudson's ability to pay or advise \nhim of his right to counsel.  Mr. Hudson spent six days in the jail for old fines.  The \nGulfport police arrested Mr. Hudson again on June 1, charging him with public \nintoxication.  Mr. Hudson is so indigent that he remains in jail on the public \nintoxication charge because he is unable to afford the $15.20 bond fee. \n41 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 42 of 63\nI .oss of I ,jyelibood \n74. \nDefendants' illegal actions have harmed many people who are barely \neconomically able to provide for themselves and their families. \n75. \nIn May 2005, Plaintiff Steven Riley spent two weeks in jail for old fines. \nAs a result, he lost his job, and his mother, confined to a wheelchair, was left alone \nwithout anyone to care for her. \n76. \nMr. Riley was arrested on May 16, 2005, when the Gulfport Police \nDepartment pulled over a car in which Mr. Riley was a passenger.  The police \nplaced him under arrest and brought him to jail.  The only reason for his arrest was \nthat he allegedly owed old fines. \n77. \nOn May 17, 2005, Mr. Riley appeared before Judge Richard Smith of the \nGulfport Municipal Court.  Mr. Riley told Judge Smith that he had ''worked off' \nhis fines by doing community service in 2002.  He told the judge the name of his \ncommunity service supervisor and told the judge that he had taken his receipt \nverifying completion of his hours to the clerk of the Gulfport Municipal Court. \n42 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 43 of 63\nThe court did not inquire about Mr. Riley's financial status or make any \ndetermination about whether his failure to pay fines was willful. \n78. \nMr. Riley remained in the jail for the next two weeks.  He called everyone \nhe could to come up with the money, but he was not able to borrow the $314 he \nsupposedly owed. \n79. \nJust eight days before he was arrested, Mr. Riley had started a new job. \nBecause of his incarceration, he lost his job.  Since then, he has only been able to \nfind part-time work. \n80. \nPlaintiff Timothy Mason was incarcerated at the Harrison County Jail \n\"working off' his old fines from May 12 to June 26, 2005.  Mr. Mason was \narrested by the D'Iberville police on May 11, 2005 after he stole a packet of beef \njerky from Wal-Mart.  On May 12, Mr. Mason pled guilty to shoplifting in \nD'Iberville Municipal Court.  He received a fine of$542 and six months probation. \nMr. Mason remained in jail, however, because of old fines owed to the City of \nGulfport. \n43 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 44 of 63\n81. \nAt the time of his arrest, Mr. Mason was living in a trailer with no electricity \nor running water.  He and his family are so poor that at times, he has resorted to \neating out of garbage dumpsters because he cannot afford food.  As a result of his \nincarceration, Mr. Mason lost a job he had just started, laying sheetrock.  This is \nthe third time Mr. Mason has been arrested for old fines. \n82. \nMr. Mason has never been advised of his right to counsel by the judges of \nthe Municipal Court.  Nor has he ever been represented by counsel in that court. \n83. \nPlaintiff Jacqueline Lindsey has been incarcerated at the Harrison County \nJail for almost two months for being too poor to pay her fines. \n84. \nMs. Lindsey was arrested by the Gulfport Police while walking home from a \nrestaurant on June 1, 2005.  The officers who approached Ms. Lindsey asked her \nname and told her to wait while they checked to see if she owed fines.  Because \nMs. Lindsey owed old fines, she was taken to jail. \n85. \nNearly one week later, Ms. Lindsey appeared before Judge Smith and was \nnever advised of her right to counsel.  Ms. Lindsey was permitted to call her uncle \n44 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 45 of 63\nfrom the telephone at the judge's bench.  In open court, with court staff and a \nroom full of inmates looking on, Ms. Lindsey pleaded with her uncle to bring her \nthe money she owed, promising to sell her car to pay him back.  Unable to come \nup with the money, Ms. Lindsey was sentenced to 52 days in jail. \n86. \nJudge Smith did not conduct any inquiry into Ms. Lindsey's background or \nfinancial circumstances before he sentenced her to nearly two months in jail.  If he \nhad, he would have known that Ms. Lindsey was too poor to pay her fines. \nAlthough she has worked pressing clothes at Exclusive Cleaners for the last two \nyears, she makes barely above minimum wage.  Due to her incarceration, Ms. \nLindsey's employer had to hire someone else to fill her position.  When she is \nreleased from jail, she will be without a job.  She has lost her only source of \nmcome. \n87. \nLeo Benoit, a 36-year-old African-American man, was riding his bicycle \nhome after working the night shift at Burger King - wearing his Burger King \nuniform and visor- when the Long Beach Police stopped him.  The police told \nhim that they stopped him for \"riding a bicycle without a light.\"  The police then \n\"ran\" Mr. Benoit's name and found that he owed $406 in old fines to Long Beach \nand $355 to Gulfport.  Mr. Benoit spent thirteen days in jail.  The Gulfport \n45 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 46 of 63\nMunicipal Court did not conduct any inquiry into Mr. Benoit's ability to pay the \nfine or advise him of his right to counsel.  Mr. Benoit supports his two children \nunder the age of two on his salary from Burger King.  His thirteen days in jail \ndeprived his family of two weeks of his income. \n88. \nDefendants' fine collection practices are illegal and unconstitutional. \nDefendants have no authority to incarcerate indigent defendants who are unable to \npay all of their fines.  They also have no legal authority to keep them in jail for \nmonths for the sole reason that they are too poor, and/or mentally, or physically \ndisabled to pay fines. \nIllegal Ohstrnctjon of P!ajutjffs' Right to Vjew Public Court Documents \n89. \nOfficials of the Gulfport Municipal Court deny Plaintiffs and others \nsimilarly situated access to court files regarding their cases in violation of the First \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Mississippi's \nPublic Records Act. \n90. \nIn accordance with the policy ofthe Gulfport Municipal Court, the \nundersigned counsel submitted a written request to view the court files of nine of \n46 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 47 of 63\ntheir clients.  The Gulfport Municipal Court charged Plaintiffs' counsel a $4.75 per \npage \"retrieval fee\" for the files.  Court Administrator Bill Markopoulos insisted \nthat the $513 bill be paid in full before counsel would be pennitted to see their \nclients' files.  The $4.75 per page \"retrieval fee\" bears no relation to the fee \nschedule posted in the Municipal Court Clerk's office. \n91. \nThe Mississippi Public Records Act states that \"public records must be \navailable for inspection by any person unless otherwise provided [by the Act],\" and \n\"providing access to public records is a duty of each public body.\"  Miss. Code \nAnn.§ 25-61-1.  The Act pennits a public body to charge \"fees reasonably \ncalculated to reimburse it for, and in no case to exceed, the actual cost of \nsearching\" for records. \n92. \nDefendant Markopoulos and other Municipal Court officials have violated \nthe Public Records Act and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution by charging excessive fees, charging fees that bear no relation \nto the actual cost of retrieving files, and purposely obstructing Plaintiffs from \naccess to public records. \n47 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 48 of 63\nCI.ASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n93. \nPlaintiffs bring this class action pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure on their behalf and on behalf of a class similarly situated \nand affected during the pendency of this lawsuit and in the future.  The class is \ndefined as all indigent persons who are: (1) facing criminal charges in the Gulfport \nMunicipal Court and entitled to court-appointed counsel, (2) currently incarcerated \nby order of the Gulfport Municipal Court for failing to pay old fines, and/or (3) \neligible for arrest by Gulfport City Police or their agents for failing to pay fines \nimposed by the Gulfport Municipal Court. \n94. \nThe members of this class are so numerous that their joinder is impractical. \nThousands of accused misdemeanants come before the Gulfport Municipal Court \neach year.  There are currently over 100 misdemeanants at the Harrison County \nJail- a facility that is already severely overcrowded.  The majority of these \nmisdemeanants are awaiting adjudication by the Gulfport Municipal Court or \nserving sentences imposed by the Court.  The practices of the Municipal Court are \ncapable of repetition yet evading review, and this is best addressed in a class \naction.  On information and belief, there are hundreds more people who are \nindigent and owe old fines, who if arrested will be subject to incarceration for \n48 \n\nCase 1:05-cv-00349-LG-RHW   Document 6   Filed 08/09/05   Page 49 of 63\nfailure to pay. \n95. \nThe policies and practices challenged in this action apply with equal force \nto the named Plaintiffs and all members of the class so that the claims of the \nnamed Plaintiffs are typical of those of the class.  All class members are current or \nfuture defendants in the Gulfport Municipal Court.  Class members have been or \nwill be, absent this Court's intervention, deprived of the right to liberty without \ndue process oflaw upon any alleged failure to pay.  All class members will \ncontinue to be subject to such conditions absent the requested relief. \n96. \nThe named Plaintiffs will fairly represent and adequately protect the \ninterests of the class as a whole.  They possess the requisite personal interest in the \nsubject matter of the lawsuit and possess no interests adverse to other class \nmembers.
