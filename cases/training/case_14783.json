    "summary": "<p>On February 24, 2011, the estate of a mentally ill inmate who committed suicide in the Sutter County Jail filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. The plaintiffs filed the lawsuit against Sutter County, the California Department of Mental Health, the county sheriff, and other mental health providers charged with his care. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the court for compensatory and punitive damages alleging violations of the Eighth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, Title II of the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and state law. The plaintiffs also allege medical malpractice, negligence, negligent supervision, training, hiring, and retention, wrongful death and failure to furnish/summon medical care. </p><p>Specifically, the decedent was experiencing mental health issues and required psychiatric treatment. On several occasion from 2009 to 2010, decedent was involuntarily hospitalized pursuant to California law at a county mental health facility. In 2010, the decedent was jailed multiple times. The last time he was jailed, a judge ordered his transfer to a hospital for treatment but the jail did not transfer him. After being placed in solitary confinement and denied treatment at the jail for four weeks, he committed suicide in his cell.</p><p>Since that time, the Sutter County Grand Jury issued a report finding, among other things, that the Jail has known deficiencies with relation to its provision of mental health care and medical treatment to inmates. For example, the Grand Jury found deficiencies such as inadequate medical staffing, lack of required training on suicide prevention and other medical treatment, non-compliant medical policies and procedures and a non-compliant medical program. According to the Grand Jury, those deficiencies were \"unacceptable.\" Plaintiffs also allege that, since Decedent's death, several other inmates have also passed away from preventable causes.</p><p>On January 9, 2012, Magistrate Judge Gregory Hollows issued an opinion granting in part and denying in part the defendant Sutter County's motion for a protective order and for temporary state of discovery. Magistrate Hollows ordered immediate discovery regarding the identities of potential defendants but stayed all remaining discovery for thirty days. 2012 WL 94618, (E.D. Cal. Jan. 9, 2012).</p><p>On February 8, 2012, Judge Morrison England issued an opinion granting the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' first amended complaint with leave to amend. 2012 WL 423704 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 8, 2012). The plaintiffs amended their complaint.</p><p>Again, the defendants moved to dismiss each of the plaintiffs' claims. On August 31, 2012, Judge England issued an opinion granting the defendants' motion in part and denying it in part. Judge England did not dismiss the all of the deliberate indifference claims, the loss of parent/child relationship claim, the professional negligence/medical malpractice claim, the negligence claim, the failure to furnish/summon medical care claim, and the wrongful death claim. Judge England did dismiss the Title II of the ADA claims, the Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act claim, the state law civil rights claim, and the negligent supervision, training, hiring and retention claim. 2012 WL 3778953 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 31, 2012). Following this order, the parties went through discovery and preparations for the trial. The parties also entered into settlement negotiations.</p><p>On July 22, 2014, the parties reached a private settlement agreement and agreed to dismiss the case. The County agreed to pay $800,000 and promised to consider expert recommendations to improve the treatment of prisoners with serious mental illness and medical conditions at the jail going forward. On September 4, 2014, Judge England dismissed the case. </p>",

Cal.) \nOur File Nos. 1137-1, 1175-1 \n \nDear Sheriff Parker and Dr. Cummings: \nWe are counsel in two recently-settled lawsuits brought against the County of \nSutter, Bock v. County of Sutter (Case No. 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN) and Prasad v. \nCounty of Sutter (Case No. 2:12-cv-00592-TLN-CKD).  Extensive discovery was done in \nthe two cases.  As part of the settlement agreement in the Bock case, the parties agreed \nthat our office would assemble recommendations for changes to improve the Sutter \nCounty Jail’s medical and mental health system.  We agreed to provide those recom-\nmendations to defense counsel, who in turn has agreed to provide them to you.  We \nunderstand that the County of Sutter has agreed to give serious consideration to these \nrecommendations.  See Appendix A, 5/20/14 Court Hearing Tr. at 4:22-5:1. \nIn assembling these recommendations, our office has obtained input from some of \nthe nation’s most distinguished experts on prison and jail medical and mental health care, \nwho have completed careful reviews of the County’s system and the circumstances of \nrecent Sutter County Jail inmate deaths.1  In the last few years, several inmates have died \n                                              \n1 These experts include:  Pablo Stewart, M.D., a psychiatrist who has served as a \nfederal court-appointed monitor of psychiatric care in jails and prisons, and has been \ncited by the United States Supreme Court, see Brown v. Plata, 131 S. Ct. 1910, 1933 n.6, \n(footnote continued) \n \n[1219062-5] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 105   Filed 07/02/14   Page 5 of 30\nSheriff J. Paul Parker \nDr. Lou Anne Cummings \nJuly 2, 2014 \nPage 2 \n \n \nat Sutter County Jail, including Rodney Bock (April 2010), Nathan Prasad (January \n2011), Erica Ness (September 2011), and Nelson Figueira-Silva (March 2013). \nThe Sutter County Grand Jury has repeatedly identified serious deficiencies in the \njail’s medical and mental health care system, both generally and as related to specific \ndeaths.  See, e.g., Final Report of the 2007-2008 Sutter County Grand Jury (July 1, 2008) \nat 134; Final Report of the 2010-2011 Sutter County Grand Jury (July 13, 2011) at 8-11; \nFinal Report of the 2011-2012 Sutter County Grand Jury re: Sutter County Jail Death \n(Apr. 9, 2012); Final Report of the 2011-2012 Sutter County Grand Jury (July 29, 2012) \nat 49-50; Final Report of the 2012-2013 Sutter County Grand Jury (July 12, 2013) at 1-5.  \nSee also May 11, 2009 Memorandum from Sutter County Health Officer to Sutter County \nBoard of Supervisors, available at http://www.co.sutter.ca.us/agenda/bos/2009/3097, Item \nNo. 22 (identifying needs with respect to suicide prevention, mental health treatment, and \n24/7 nursing coverage). \nThere are several steps that the County of Sutter can and should take right away to \navoid future tragedies similar to those suffered by Mr. Bock, Mr. Prasad, Ms. Ness, \nMr. Figueira-Silva, and the loved ones who survive them.  Some of our recommended \nchanges require the provision of additional resources, but are nonetheless essential to \nprevent future deaths and the costly lawsuits that may follow.  Other recommended \nchanges are remarkably inexpensive and entail simple, common-sense steps that can save \nlives.2  We provide our recommendations below. \n                                              \n1935 (2011); Lindsay Hayes, Project Director of the National Center on Institutions and \nAlternatives, a nationally recognized expert in the field of suicide prevention within jails, \nprisons, and juvenile facilities who has served as a federal court-appointed monitor and \nsuicide prevention consultant to the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division; \nand Robert L. Cohen, M.D., an expert in prison health care (see Parsons v. Ryan, Case \nNo. 12-16396, ___ F.3d __, 2014 WL 2523682, at *6 (9th Cir. June 5, 2014)) who has \nserved as court-appointed monitor in cases regarding the provision of medical care in \nprisons and jails in cases in throughout the country, and served as a member of the Board \nof the National Commission on Correctional Health Care for seventeen years. \n2 Attached as Appendix B is Lindsay Hayes’ “Guide to Developing and Revising \nSuicide Prevention Protocols within Jails and Prisons,” which offers further detail and \nguidance regarding the implementation of an adequate suicide prevention program. \n \n[1219062-5] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 105   Filed 07/02/14   Page 6 of 30\nSheriff J. Paul Parker \nDr. Lou Anne Cummings \nJuly 2, 2014 \nPage 3 \n \n \nRecommendations to Improve Care and Avoid Preventable Deaths at Sutter County Jail \n1.  Update Jail Intake Procedures to Identify Prisoners with Serious \nPsychiatric or Medical Conditions.  The intake screening process for newly booked \nprisoners is antiquated and grossly inadequate.  Without adequate screening, prisoners at \nrisk are all too likely to be missed, with unnecessary and tragic outcomes.  If done \nappropriately, screening can be extremely effective in identifying inmates with serious \nmental illness or medical problems.  The jail’s screening questions need to be updated \nand should include meaningful questions regarding an inmate’s mental illness and risk for \nsuicide.  See, e.g., Appendix B at 2-3.  Medical intake screening should be designed to \nidentify medical problems that may require urgent or emergent evaluation by a physician, \nincluding but not limited to diabetes, hypertension, epilepsy, asthma, HIV infection, and \nheart disease. \nScreening of inmates needs to be done in a confidential setting, not in the central \nbooking area where other new inmates are just a few feet away.  Medical or mental health \npersonnel should conduct the screenings, not custody staff.  If licensed vocational nurses \n(“LVNs”)—or any other staff not licensed to diagnose or treat medical or mental \nillnesses—conduct the screenings, they must be trained to urgently or emergently refer \npatients with chronic illnesses who are receiving medications or those who have \nquestionable vital signs to the facility physician or mid-level provider, and to obtain \nimmediate telephone consultation for inmate-patients as needed. \nMedical intake screening should also include enhanced screening for alcohol and \ndrug withdrawal, both common and extremely serious conditions for men and women \nentering jail.  Patients screened who are found to be at risk for withdrawal should receive \nimmediate medical evaluation and require close monitoring or transfer to a facility \nequipped for treatment of these conditions. \n2.  Provide 24/7 Medical Coverage at Sutter County Jail to Ensure Timely \nAccess to Medical Care.  During the period from 12:00 midnight to 4:30 a.m. each day, \nthere are no medical staff on site at the jail, and no physicians on call.  It was during this \nfour-and-a-half-hour overnight period on January 28, 2011 that the infection Mr. Prasad \nhad developed took a serious turn for the worse.  In these critical hours, Mr. Prasad was \ncoughing up blood and sweating profusely, and his vital signs were plummeting.  With no \nmedical staff available, Mr. Prasad’s condition went from likely treatable to fatal. \nThis issue—and Sutter County’s knowledge of the problem—dates back several \nyears, including a 2007-2008 grand jury report that recommended 24/7 medical staffing \nat the jail.  Sheriff Parker, Jail Commander David Samson, and Lieutenant Norman \n \n[1219062-5] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 105   Filed 07/02/14   Page 7 of 30\nSheriff J. Paul Parker \nDr. Lou Anne Cummings \nJuly 2, 2014 \nPage 4 \n \n \nBidwell have all stated, including in sworn testimony, that they believe that the jail needs \nto have round-the-clock medical staff.  Even the County’s one-time jail nurse manager \nmade repeated requests for 24/7 medical staffing, but was told that there was simply “not \nmoney in the budget.”  By ignoring these repeated requests and leaving inmates without \naccess to medical care for over one-sixth of every day, the County creates a predictable \nrisk of serious and even lethal consequences for inmates. \nTo date, the County has not agreed to provide funding for this needed continuous \ncoverage.  We recommend that the County reconsider this decision; in the long run, 24/7 \non-site medical coverage will save both lives and money.  If on-site coverage for any \nperiod is provided exclusively by personnel not licensed to diagnose medical conditions \n(e.g., LVNs), those personnel must have specific and concrete guidance about the signs, \nsymptoms and complaints that should trigger an immediate referral to a higher-level \nprovider and/or the emergency room. \n3.  Increase Licensed Mental Health Staffing at Sutter County Jail to \nEnsure Timely Access to Mental Health Care.  Other than a psychiatrist (Dr. John Zil) \nwho is on-site for no more than four hours per week, the Sutter County Jail currently does \nnot staff any qualified, licensed mental health professionals.  The “crisis counselors” who \nwork at the jail are required to have little more than a valid driver’s license.  A minimally \nadequate standard of care requires that a qualified mental health professional be involved \nin any decision to place an inmate on suicide precautions, to discharge inmates from \nsuicide precautions, and to make other significant treatment decisions related to mental \nhealth care.3 \nShockingly, Mr. Bock went directly from round-the-clock hospital-level \npsychiatric care at the County’s Psychiatric Health Facility to essentially no care at all at \nthe jail.  Dr. Zil saw Mr. Bock only one time during his month-long detention, and not \nonce in the approximately 19 days preceding his suicide.  Consequently, the jail did not \nprovide necessary and potentially life-saving psychiatric attention to Mr. Bock in those \ncritical days.  The jail must increase its staffing of qualified, licensed mental health \n                                              \n3Qualified mental health professionals include psychiatrists, psychologists, \npsychiatric social workers, psychiatric nurses, and others who by virtue of their \neducation, credentials, and experience are permitted by law to evaluate and care for the \nmental health needs of patients. \n \n \n[1219062-5] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 105   Filed 07/02/14   Page 8 of 30\nSheriff J. Paul Parker \nDr. Lou Anne Cummings \nJuly 2, 2014 \nPage 5 \n \n \nprofessionals.  Those providers need to be notified of and follow up with inmates \nshowing signs of serious mental illness.  Otherwise, more deaths are inevitable. \n4.  Ensure Inmate Treatment Planning and Adequate Communication \nBetween Sutter County Jail Custody Staff, Medical Staff, and Mental Health \nProviders.  Section 1210 of Title 15 requires that, for every inmate treated for a mental \nillness or major medical problem in a jail, “treatment staff shall develop a written \n[individualized] treatment plan” and “custody staff shall be informed of the treatment \nplan when necessary, to ensure coordination and cooperation in the ongoing care of the \ninmate.”  We were troubled to discover that inmates at Sutter County Jail, including \nMr. Bock and Mr. Prasad, do not receive the treatment plans required by state law.  \nMeanwhile, custody staff repeatedly testified that they never receive information about \ninmates’ medical and mental health needs, including relevant hospital discharge \ninstructions, even though custody officers are the sole personnel in the inmate housing \nunits able to observe and respond to inmate health needs for much of each day. \nHIPAA specifically authorizes the sharing of protected inmate health information \nwith correctional staff when needed to protect “the health and safety of such individual[,] \n… other inmates[,]” or “the officers or employees of or others at the correctional \ninstitution.”  45 C.F.R. § 164.512(k)(5).  Policies, procedures, and practices at Sutter \nCounty Jail must be modified to ensure that inmates receive written individualized \ntreatment plans and that staff—including custody staff—have the information they need \nto implement those plans.  The risk to inmates’ health and safety absent adequate \ntreatment planning and cross-discipline communication is simply too great. \n5.  Transfer Sutter County Jail Prisoners with Serious Mental Illness to a \nHospital Setting.  Mr. Bock committed suicide after being moved directly from the \nCounty’s inpatient psychiatric facility (on a Section 5150 involuntary psychiatric \nadmission) to the jail.  Sutter County Jail does not have the licensing, staffing, or \nresources to safely house or treat prisoners with serious mental illness.  Your County’s \ncitizens who require Section 5150 psychiatric hospitalization, or have been found \nincompetent to stand trial by reason of mental illness, or otherwise suffer from serious \nmental illness should not be admitted to or housed at the jail.  As the federal judge in the \nBock case found, the superior court judge’s order for Mr. Bock to be transferred to a state \npsychiatric hospital “could have saved his life” if only the County had followed it. \n6.  Do Not Place Prisoners with Mental Illness in the Jail’s Solitary \nConfinement Cells.  Sutter County Jail has a dangerous, longstanding policy and \npractice to house inmates with mental illness in solitary confinement, meaning that they \nare kept in their cell for 23 hours per day and have no normal social contact with others \n \n[1219062-5] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 105   Filed 07/02/14   Page 9 of 30\nSheriff J. Paul Parker \nDr. Lou Anne Cummings \nJuly 2, 2014 \nPage 6 \n \n \noutside of their cell.  There is now widespread recognition of the substantial risk of harm \nto inmates with mental illness housed in such a setting.  See, e.g., National Research \nCouncil-National Academy of Sciences, The Growth of Incarceration in the United \nStates: Exploring Causes and Consequences (2014) at 186-188; American Psychiatric \nAssociation Position Statement on Segregation of Prisoners with Mental illness (2012) \n(“[P]rolonged segregation of adult inmates with serious mental illness, with rare \nexceptions, should be avoided due to the potential for harm to such inmates.”) \nSutter County Jail staff members themselves recognize that inmates with mental \nillness (like Rodney Bock) should not be housed in isolation units.  Captain Lewis \nMcElfresh, who served as Jail Division Commander from 2006-2010, testified that “[t]he \njail, A-Pod [an isolation unit], is not a place for mental health patients.”  A sheriff’s \ndeputy working in the isolation units (A- and B-pods) expressed to our experts during a \nrecent jail tour that prisoners with mental illness “shouldn’t be here, in my opinion.” \nMoreover, many of these cells are themselves unsafe and pose undue risks to the \nsafety of prisoners with mental illness.  For example, the County placed Mr. Bock in a \nsingle-man cell in the solitary confinement A-Pod unit that was on the second floor and \nout of custody staff’s and surveillance camera’s line-of-sight.  Mr. Bock’s cell also was \nnot protrusion-free, meaning that there were attachment points for an inmate to attach a \nsuicide noose (as Mr. Bock did).  Such hazards must be identified and eliminated in order \nto prevent predictable harm. \nPrisoners with mental illness should be housed and clustered in a non-isolation \nunit that provides for adequate supervision, access to treatment, out-of-cell time, and \nsuicide-resistant features.  Prisoners with mental illness should be promptly moved to \nhospital-level care when clinically indicated. \n7.  Provide Suicide Prevention Training for Both Custody and Non-\nCustody Staff.  Dr. Zil testified that he used to provide suicide prevention training to \ncustody staff at Sutter County Jail annually, but this training was ended many years ago.  \nSound correctional practice requires all staff—both custody staff and non-custody staff \n(i.e., nursing)—to receive detailed live training, at least annually, on recognizing and \nresponding to inmate suicide risks, as well as emergency response procedures.  See, e.g., \nAppendix B at 1. \n8.  Implement a Method for Inmates’ Family Members to Convey \nConcerns about Their Loved Ones.  A major failure surrounding Mr. Bock’s death was \nthat his daughters, who visited him weekly and saw his condition getting worse and \nworse, had no idea if or how they could communicate their concerns about their father to \n \n[1219062-5] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 105   Filed 07/02/14   Page 10 of 30\nSheriff J. Paul Parker \nDr. Lou Anne Cummings \nJuly 2, 2014 \nPage 7 \n \n \njail staff.  The jail’s crisis counselor testified that there is no procedure for family \nmembers to alert jail officials about serious concerns regarding inmates’ physical and \nmental health. \nWe recommend that you follow the lead of El Dorado, Santa Clara, and at least a \ndozen other California counties that have systems in place—including posted and online \nguidance, contact information, and forms—for family members to communicate \ninformation about an inmate’s mental health or medical needs, histories, and medications \nto jail staff.  (Forms already in use are available at www.namicalifornia.org/criminal-\njustice.php?page=jail-resources&lang=eng.)  This is a simple, low-cost way to help \nensure that prisoners with serious illness get the care they need while in custody. \n9.  Improve Communication Between Sutter-Yuba Mental Health Services \nand Sutter County Jail.  Sutter-Yuba Mental Health Services (SYMHS) is the \ndesignated provider of psychiatric services at the jail.  Many inmates, like Rodney Bock, \nhave been treated for mental illness at SYMHS’s Psychiatric Health Facility (PHF) at \nsome point prior to their jail detention.  Yet Dr. Christopher Barnett—the clinical director \nof SYMHS’s PHF and psychiatric emergency services—testified that he had no idea what \nmental health services are provided at the jail, where prisoners with mental illness may be \nhoused, or what policies and procedures exist for treating prisoners with mental illness.  It \nis deeply troubling that, beyond Dr. Zil and the handful of SYMHS crisis counselors at \nSutter County Jail, SYMHS staff and leadership are entirely disconnected from the \nmental health services at the jail.  Better communication is essential. \nAll SYMHS staff should be trained on what services are available to SYMHS \npatients housed at the jail.  Communication between the jail and SYMHS’s community \nfacilities regarding mental health histories, discharge summaries, and treatment plans for \ninmates with mental illness must be improved, to ensure adequate continuity of care.  \nProper written and telephone communication between clinical staff is necessary so that \ninmates with known mental illness do not fall through the cracks as Mr. Bock did. \n10.  Fix the Jail’s Broken Death Review Process.  The County of Sutter never \ncompleted a full investigation or death review for the deaths of Mr. Bock and Mr. Prasad.  \nDr. Zil testified that he was informed by the County’s director of mental health that \nattorneys had directed the County not to conduct any death review for Mr. Bock.  \nSimilarly, Dr. Cummings directed medical staff not to discuss Mr. Prasad’s case, and did \nnot share her personal post-mortem chart review for Mr. Prasad with anyone.  These \nfailures violate Sutter County’s own Jail Policy Manual, as well as Section 1046 of Title \n15 of the California Code of Regulations. \n \n[1219062-5] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 105   Filed 07/02/14   Page 11 of 30\nSheriff J. Paul Parker \nDr. Lou Anne Cummings \nJuly 2, 2014 \nPage 8 \n \n \nSound correctional practice requires a mortality-morbidity review for every death, \nsuicide, or serious suicide attempt.  This allows for a critical inquiry into the incident, \nfacility procedures, training practices, available medical and mental health services, and \nthe possible need for system improvements to avoid similar outcomes in the future. \n11.  Ensure Meaningful Training and Accountability to Maintain a \nCompetent, Qualified, and Effective Staff.  Actions of County personnel in both the \nPrasad and Bock deaths reveal a troubling lack of training and appropriate supervision. \nLikewise, the County’s post-incident discipline and follow-up were horribly deficient.  \nAdequate training (at the front end) and discipline (at the back end) are essential \ningredients of a minimally adequate jail health care system.  Written policies, however \nimproved, are not enough on their own. \nBy way of example: on the last morning of Mr. Prasad’s life, he was displaying \nalarming medical symptoms, yet the vocational nurse on duty confined him to a jail \noffice for hours rather than summoning emergency care.  Following Mr. Prasad’s death, \nher supervisor told her that she “did a good job and handled it well” and that there was \n“nothing more [she] could have done.”  Neither of these staff members was ever \ndisciplined or counseled by the County.  Yet their respective licensing boards have \nmoved to revoke both of their licenses for the “incompetence” and “unprofessional \nconduct” they displayed in failing to address Mr. Prasad’s medical emergency.  See \nhttp://www.bvnpt.ca.gov/public/vn104567.pdf; http://rn.ca.gov/public/rn530916.pdf. \nIn Mr. Bock’s case, the psychiatrist at SYMHS charged with caring for Mr. Bock \nappears to have violated state law by approving Mr. Bock’s discharge from a Section \n5150 hospitalization and transfer to the jail while Mr. Bock was still psychotic, \ndelusional, and in need of hospital-level care.  See Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 5152.  Just \ndays before his death, a jail crisis counselor documented that Mr. Bock was unstable, \nrefusing medication, delusional, and having auditory hallucinations, but did not convey \nthis information to anyone.  Neither employee was counseled, disciplined, or held \naccountable by the County in any way. \nThe County’s failure to properly train or supervise these and other employees \ninvolved in the deaths of Mr. Prasad and Mr. Bock—or to counsel, discipline, or \notherwise address their conduct—is deeply problematic.  The County must implement \nappropriate measures to ensure that staff understand and implement appropriate policies \nand practices.  The County must also hold staff accountable when their conduct \ncontributes to a serious injury or death at the jail—including, at a minimum, re-training \nand re-evaluating their skill sets to ensure that they meet the minimum standards to be \nentrusted with the lives of inmates under their care. \n \n[1219062-5] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 105   Filed 07/02/14   Page 12 of 30\nSheriff J.

We would be happy\nto discuss these recommendations or to facilitate communications with the experts whose\nanalyses informed them.

County of Sutter, et al.  Your Honor, this is on calendar\n 6 for a further settlement conference.\n 7 THE COURT:  All right.  Let’s go ahead and state\n 8 everybody’s appearance on the record.  For the plaintiffs?\n 9 MR. BIEN:  Good morning, Your Honor.  Michael Bien\n10 and Aaron Fischer on behalf of the plaintiffs.\n11 THE COURT:  All right.  Mr. Bien, Mr. Fischer.\n12 MR. WHITEFLEET:  Good morning, Your Honor, or it’s\n13 close to afternoon.  John Whitefleet for the defendants and\n14 with me is Ken Miley of the Risk Management Authority.\n15 THE COURT:  All right.  And I think you’re right.  It\n16 is afternoon now.\n17 All right.  The record will reflect that we’ve been\n18 in further settlement conference this morning.  I believe this\n19 is now the third conference that we’ve convened.  Substantial\n20 progress was made over the first two.  We set a further\n21 settlement conference for today’s date and the morning has been\n22 productive.  We have -- we appear to have reached a full and\n23 final settlement of this matter.\n24 And counsel, I’m going to ask each of you to confirm\n25 the terms of the settlement.  Mr. Whitefleet, why don’t we have\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 105   Filed 07/02/14   Page 16 of 30\n2\n 1 you recite your understanding of the terms of the settlement.\n 2 MR. WHITEFLEET:  And thank you, Your Honor.  My\n 3 understanding is defendant County has agreed to pay a sum total\n 4 of $800,000 subject to the approval of the CSAC EIA Committee,\n 5 and a signing of a standard settlement and release in exchange\n 6 for dismissal with prejudice.\n 7 THE COURT:  All right.  And that committee meets on\n 8 June 4, is that correct?\n 9 MR. WHITEFLEET:  The next scheduled meeting is for\n10 June 4th, correct.\n11 THE COURT:  All right.  And it’s your intention to\n12 recommend to the committee that they approve this settlement in\n13 the amount of $800,000?\n14 MR. WHITEFLEET:  Yes.\n15 THE COURT:  All right.  Now, as to the -- we had some\n16 discussion about recommended procedural changes and policy\n17 changes.  What’s your understanding as to that?\n18 MR. WHITEFLEET:  Your Honor, if I may, I understand\n19 that there have been implemented changes already performed.  We\n20 can offer a list of those, if you’d like.\n21 THE COURT:  Yes.  Why don’t we have those -- have\n22 that list read.\n23 MR. MILEY:  Your Honor, this is Ken Miley.  There’s\n24 seven items that the County has implemented to improve the\n25 healthcare delivery system at the jail, and I’ll go over them\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 105   Filed 07/02/14   Page 17 of 30\n3\n 1 one by one.\n 2 They are providing ASIST program training to all\n 3 current jail medical staff and this training will also be given\n 4 to all new staff.  ASIST stands for Applied Suicide\n 5 Intervention Skills Training.  It’s a recognized program.\n 6 Secondly, they’ve hired a new medical director.\n 7 Third, they’ve updated the policies and procedures\n 8 and included that in all manuals giving priority to inmate\n 9 safety.  An example of one of the policies and procedures that\n10 they’ve changed and updated is when an inmate refuses\n11 medication, after three days in a row notices are given to the\n12 medical providers for appropriate intervention.\n13 Number four, they’ve increased staff.  They’ve hired\n14 two registered nurses with ER experience, emergency room\n15 experience.  They’ve hired one public health nurse, and one\n16 LVN, and these are all additions to staff.\n17 They’ve also added an extra health nurse practitioner\n18 as a cover position for vacations and off hours.  They’ve\n19 improved the sick call response time.  And lastly, they’ve\n20 trained staff on documentation for care of inmates in the\n21 safety cells, sobering cells, and medical cells, and that’s an\n22 increase in training.\n23 And those are the seven items that the County has\n24 implemented.  And they’re also reviewing and looking at\n25 additional ways to improve the system.\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 105   Filed 07/02/14   Page 18 of 30\n4\n 1 THE COURT:  All right.  Now, Mr. Bien -- well, first\n 2 of all, let me just have you confirm your understanding as to\n 3 the monetary part of the settlement.\n 4 MR. BIEN:  Your Honor, we agree that the parties have\n 5 reached an agreement to -- the plaintiffs will accept a total\n 6 payment of $800,000 in return for dismissal with prejudice of\n 7 the lawsuit.\n 8 THE COURT:  All right.  Now, as to the procedural\n 9 changes and the policy changes the plaintiffs, in addition to\n10 this list of seven items that Mr. Miley just read for the\n11 record, in addition to that, the plaintiffs intend to submit\n12 some sort of a written proposal with recommendations, is that\n13 correct?\n14 MR. BIEN:  Yes, Your Honor, and defense counsel has\n15 agreed that we -- if we provide such a writing to him, he will\n16 provide it to the sheriff and the medical director, and we have\n17 recommendations from our experts in this case, and a related\n18 case, Prasad, which also involved a death at Sutter County Jail\n19 in an applicable time period.  We have various ideas and\n20 recommendations for additional changes, and the County has\n21 agreed to hear that from us.\n22 THE COURT:  All right.  And Mr. Miley, Mr.\n23 Whitefleet, it’s your understanding that the County will\n24 serious consider those proposals?\n25 MR. WHITEFLEET:  That’s correct, Your Honor.\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 105   Filed 07/02/14   Page 19 of 30\n5\n 1 MR. MYELINI:  That’s correct, Your Honor.\n 2 MR. WHITEFLEET:  And just as one point of\n 3 clarification, just so we can make sure everything is clear and\n 4 expressed.  That the monetary amount of the resolution is of\n 5 all claims to all parties and requires all parties to bear\n 6 their own fees and costs.\n 7 MR. BIEN:  Yes, Your Honor.  We agree.\n 8 THE COURT:  All right.  It does then appear that we\n 9 do have a full and final settlement of the case.  The -- I will\n10 be entering what we refer to as the drop dead order.  It’s an\n11 order that will vacate all dates in the case.  It will vacate\n12 the trial date, and any remaining due dates for filing of\n13 documents, discovery, et cetera.  And it will set a new\n14 deadline, and that deadline will be the filing of the\n15 dispositional document, that is the stipulation for dismissal\n16 in this case.\n17 Is 30 days enough time for that, or do you need more\n18 than 30 days?\n19 MR. WHITEFLEET:  Just to ensure that we meet the\n20 Court’s set deadline, once it is set, we would prefer 45 days.\n21 THE COURT:  All right.\n22 MR. BIEN:  That’s fine, Your Honor.\n23 THE COURT:  All right.  Then we’ll -- it will be a\n24 45-day deadline then, assuming that the committee approves the\n25 $800,000 settlement, and it sounds like that’s likely to\n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 105   Filed 07/02/14   Page 20 of 30\n6\n 1 happen.  You anticipate that a check would issue within a few\n 2 weeks after that date, is that correct?\n 3 MR. WHITEFLEET:  Yes, Your Honor.\n 4 THE COURT:  All right.  We do have a final\n 5 settlement.\n 6 I want to compliment counsel for both sides, or for\n 7 your diligence and also your patience.  We’ve achieved a\n 8 settlement in a case where when we began the conference, I\n 9 didn’t think a settlement would be possible.  So my compliments\n10 to each of you.\n11 And to the family, I want to also commend you for\n12 your patience.  You’ve achieved not only what I tink is a very\n13 reasonable and fair monetary settlement, but it’s also had the\n14 result of some important and significant changes that are being\n15 made at the jail that are much needed.  So my compliments to\n16 you as well.\n17 All right.  Thank you.\n18 MR. BIEN:  Thank you, Your Honor.\n19 MR.

Hayes \n©National Center on Institutions and Alternatives, 2013 \n \nAll  correctional  facilities,  regardless  of  size,  should  have  a  comprehensive  suicide \nprevention program that addresses the following critical components. \n \nStaff Training \n \nThe essential component to any suicide prevention program is properly trained staff, who \nform the backbone of any correctional facility.  Very few suicides are actually prevented \nby  mental  health,  medical  or  other  professional  staff  because  suicides  are  usually \nattempted in housing units, and often during late evening hours or on weekends when \nthey are generally outside the purview of program staff.  These incidents, therefore, must \nbe thwarted by correctional staff who have been trained in suicide prevention and have \ndeveloped an intuitive sense about suicidal inmates.  Correctional staff are often the only \npersonnel available 24 hours a day; thus, they form the front line of defense in preventing \nsuicides. \n   \nAll correctional, medical, and mental health personnel, as well as any staff who have \nregular contact with inmates, should receive eight (8) hours of initial suicide prevention \ntraining, followed by two (2) hours of refresher training each year.  The initial training \nshould  include  administrator/staff  attitudes  about  suicide  and  how  negative  attitudes \nimpede  suicide  prevention  efforts,  guiding  principles  to  suicide  prevention,  inmate \nsuicide research, why the environments of correctional facilities are conducive to suicidal \nbehavior, potential predisposing factors to suicide, high-risk suicide periods, warning \nsigns and symptoms, identifying suicidal inmates despite the denial of risk, components \nof the facility’s suicide prevention policy, and liability issues associated with inmate \nsuicide.  The two-hour refresher training should include a review of administrator/staff \nattitudes about suicide and how negative attitudes impede suicide prevention efforts, \npredisposing  risk  factors,  warning  signs  and  symptoms,  identifying  suicidal  inmates \ndespite the denial of risk, and review of any changes to the facility’s suicide prevention \nplan.  The annual training should also include general discussion of any recent suicides \nand/or suicide attempts in the facility. \n \nIn addition, all staff who have routine contact with inmates should receive standard first \naid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training.  All staff should also be trained in \nthe use of various emergency equipment located in each housing unit.  In an effort to \nensure an efficient emergency response to suicide attempts, “mock drills” should be \nincorporated into both initial and refresher training for all staff. \n \n \n[1220877-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 105   Filed 07/02/14   Page 24 of 30\n  2\n \n \nIdentification/Referral/Evaluation \n \nIntake  screening  and  on-going  assessment  of all  inmates  is  critical  to  a  correctional \nfacility’s suicide prevention efforts.  It should not be viewed as a single event, but as an \non-going  process  because  inmates  can  become  suicidal  at  any  point  during  their \nconfinement, including the initial admission into the facility; after adjudication when the \ninmate is returned to the facility from court; following receipt of bad news or after \nsuffering any type of humiliation or rejection; confinement in isolation or segregation; \nand following prolonged a stay in the facility. \n \nIn addition, although there is no single set of risk factors that mental health and medical \ncommunities agree can be used to predict suicide, there is little disagreement about the \nvalue of screening and assessment in preventing suicide.  Research consistently reports \nthat approximately two-thirds of all suicide victims communicate their intent some time \nbefore death, and that any individual with a history of one or more suicide attempts is at a \nmuch greater risk for suicide than those who have never made an attempt. \n \nIntake screening for suicide risk may be contained within the medical screening form or \nas a separate form.  The screening process should include inquiry regarding: past suicidal \nideation  and/or  attempts;  current  ideation,  threat,  plan;  prior  mental  health \ntreatment/hospitalization;  recent  significant  loss  (job,  relationship,  death  of  family \nmember/close friend, etc.); history of suicidal behavior by family member/close friend; \nsuicide risk during prior confinement; and arresting/transporting officer(s) belief that the \ninmate is currently at risk.  Specifically, inquiry should determine the following: \n \n \n[1220877-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 105   Filed 07/02/14   Page 25 of 30\n \n•  Was the inmate a medical, mental health or suicide risk during any prior \ncontact and/or confinement within this facility?  \n \n•  Does the arresting and/or transporting officer have any information (e.g., \nfrom observed behavior, documentation from sending agency or facility, \nconversation  with  family  member)  that  indicates  inmate  is  a  medical, \nmental health or suicide risk now? \n \n•  Have you ever attempted suicide?  \n \n•  Have you ever considered suicide?  \n \n•  Are you now or have you ever been treated for mental health or emotional \nproblems?  \n \n•  Have you recently experienced a significant loss (relationship, death of \nfamily member/close friend, job, etc.)? \n \n•  Has a family member/close friend ever attempted or committed suicide?  \n \n•  Do you feel there is nothing to look forward to in the immediate future \n(expressing helplessness and/or hopelessness)?  \n \n•  Are you thinking of hurting and/or killing yourself? \n \n \nAlthough  an  inmate’s  verbal  responses  during  the  intake  screening  process  are  critically \nimportant to assessing the risk of suicide, staff should not exclusively rely on an inmate’s denial \nthat they are suicidal and/or have a history of mental illness and suicidal behavior, particularly \nwhen  their  behavior  and/or  actions  or  even  previous  confinement  in  the  facility  suggest \notherwise. \n \nThe process should also include referral procedures to mental health and/or medical personnel \nfor a more thorough and complete assessment. \n \nThe intake screening process should be viewed as similar to taking your temperature, it can \nidentify a current fever, but not a future cold.  Therefore, following the intake screening process, \nshould any staff hear an inmate verbalize a desire or intent to commit suicide, observe an inmate \nengaging in any self-harm, or otherwise believe an inmate is at risk for suicide, a procedure \nshould be in place that requires staff to take immediate action to ensure that the individual is \nconstantly observed until appropriate medical, mental health, and/or supervisory assistance is \nobtained. \n \n \n[1220877-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 105   Filed 07/02/14   Page 26 of 30\n \nFinally, given the strong association between inmate suicide and isolation/special management \n(e.g.,  disciplinary  and/or  administrative  segregation)  housing  unit  placement,  any  inmate \nassigned to such a special housing unit should receive a written assessment for suicide risk by \nmedical or mental health staff upon admission to the placement. \n \nThe screening and assessment process is only one of several tools that increases the opportunity \nto identify suicide risk in inmates.  This process, coupled with staff training, will only be \nsuccessful if an effective method of communication is in place at the facility. \n \n \nCommunication \n \nCertain behavioral signs exhibited by the inmate may be indicative of suicidal behavior and, if \ndetected and communicated to others, can reduce the likelihood of suicide.  In addition, most \nsuicides can be prevented by correctional staff who establish trust and rapport with inmates, \ngather  pertinent  information,  and  take  action.    There  are  essentially  three  levels  of \ncommunication in preventing inmate suicides: between the arresting/transporting officer and \ncorrectional staff; between and among facility staff (including correctional, medical and mental \nhealth personnel); and between facility staff and the suicidal inmate. \n \nIn many ways, suicide prevention begins at the point of arrest.  At Level 1, what an arrestee says \nand how they behave during arrest, transport to the facility, and at intake are crucial in detecting \nsuicidal behavior.  The scene of arrest is often the most volatile and emotional time for the \nindividual.  Arresting officers should pay close attention to the arrestee during this time; suicidal \nbehavior  may  be  manifested  by  the  anxiety  or  hopelessness  of  the  situation,  and  previous \nbehavior can be confirmed by onlookers such as family members and friends.  Any pertinent \ninformation  regarding  the  arrestee’s  well-being  must  be  communicated  by  the  arresting  or \ntransporting officer to correctional staff.  It is also critically important for correctional staff to \nmaintain  open  lines  of  communication  with  family  members  who  often  have  pertinent \ninformation regarding the mental health status of inmates. \n \nAt  Level  2,  effective  management  of  suicidal  inmates  is  based  on  communication  among \ncorrectional personnel and other professional staff in the facility.  Because inmates can become \nsuicidal at any point during confinement, correctional staff must maintain awareness, share \ninformation and make appropriate referrals to mental health and medical staff.  At a minimum, \nthe  facility’s  shift  supervisor  should  ensure  that  appropriate  correctional  staff  are  properly \ninformed of the status of each inmate placed on suicide precautions.  The shift supervisor should \nalso be responsible for briefing the incoming shift supervisor regarding the status of all inmates \non suicide precautions.  Multidisciplinary team meetings (to include correctional, medical and \nmental health personnel) should occur on a regular basis to discuss the status of inmates on \nsuicide precautions.  Finally, the authorization for suicide precautions, any changes in suicide \nprecautions,  and  observation  of  inmates  placed  on  precautions  should  be  documented  on \ndesignated forms and distributed to appropriate staff. \n \n[1220877-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 105   Filed 07/02/14   Page 27 of 30\n \n   \nAt  Level  3,  facility  staff  must  use  various  communication  skills  with  the  suicidal  inmate, \nincluding  active  listening,  staying  with  the  inmate  if  they  suspect  immediate  danger,  and \nmaintaining contact through conversation, eye contact, and body language.  Correctional staff \nshould trust their own judgment and observation of risk behavior, and avoid being misled by \nothers (including mental health staff) into ignoring signs of suicidal behavior. \n   \nPoor communication between and among correctional, medical, and mental health personnel, as \nwell as outside entities (e.g., arresting or referral agencies, family members) is a common factor \nfound in the reviews of many custodial suicides.  Communication problems are often caused by \nlack of respect, personality conflicts and boundary issues.  Simply stated, facilities that maintain \na multidisciplinary approach avoid preventable suicides. \n \nHousing \n \nIn determining the most appropriate housing location for a suicidal inmates, correctional facility \nofficials (with concurrence from medical and/or mental health staff) often tend to physically \nisolate (or segregate) and sometimes restrain the individual.  These responses might be more \nconvenient for all staff, but they are detrimental to the inmate since the use of isolation escalates \nthe sense of alienation and further removes the individual from proper staff supervision.  To \nevery extent possible, suicidal inmates should be housed in the general population, mental health \nunit, or medical infirmary, located close to staff.  Further, removal of an inmate’s clothing \n(excluding belts and shoelaces) and the use of physical restraints (e.g., restraint chairs or boards, \nleather straps, handcuffs, straitjackets) should be avoided whenever possible, and used only as a \nlast  resort  when  the  inmate  is  physically  engaging  in  self-destructive  behavior.    Housing \nassignments should be based on the ability to maximize staff interaction with the inmate, not on \ndecisions that heighten depersonalizing aspects of confinement. \n \nAll cells designated to house suicidal inmates should be as suicide-resistant as is reasonably \npossible, free of all obvious protrusions, and provide full visibility.  These cells should contain \ntamper-proof light fixtures, smoke detectors and ceiling/wall air vents that are protrusion-free.  \nIn addition, the cells should not contain any live electrical switches or outlets, bunks with open \nbottoms, any type of clothing hook, towel racks on desks and sinks, radiator vents, or any other \nobject that provides an easy anchoring device for hanging.  Each cell door should contain a \nheavy gauge Lexan (or equivalent grade) clear panel that is large enough to allow staff a full and \nunobstructed view of the cell interior.  Finally, each housing unit in the facility should contain \nvarious emergency equipment, including a first aid kit, pocket mask or face shield, Ambu-bag, \nand rescue tool (to quickly cut through fibrous material).  Correctional staff should ensure that \nsuch equipment is in working order on a daily basis. \n \n \n \n \n[1220877-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 105   Filed 07/02/14   Page 28 of 30\n \nLevels of Observation/Management \n \nIn regard to suicide attempts in correctional facilities, the promptness of the response is often \ndriven by the level of supervision afforded the inmate.  The planning of and preparation for \nsuicide can take several minutes; brain damage from strangulation caused by a suicide attempt \ncan occur within 4 minutes, and death often within 5 to 6 minutes.  Two levels of supervision \nare generally recommended for suicidal inmates: close observation and constant observation.  \n \n Close Observation is reserved for the inmate who is not actively suicidal, but \nexpresses suicidal ideation (e.g., expressing a wish to die without a specific threat \nor plan) and/or has a recent prior history of self-destructive behavior. In addition, \nan  inmate  who  denies  suicidal  ideation  or  does  not  threaten  suicide,  but \ndemonstrates other concerning behavior (through actions, current circumstances, \nor recent history) indicating the potential for self-injury, should be placed under \nclose observation.  Staff should observe such an inmate in a protrusion-free cell at \nstaggered intervals not to exceed every 10 minutes (e.g., 5, 10, 7 minutes).   \n \nConstant Observation is reserved for the inmate who is actively suicidal, either \nthreatening or engaging in suicidal behavior.  Staff should observe such an inmate \non a continuous, uninterrupted basis.  In some jurisdictions, an intermediate level \nof supervision is utilized with observation at staggered intervals that do not exceed \nevery 5 minutes.   \n \nOther aids (e.g., closed-circuit television, cell mates) can be used as a supplement \nto, but never as a substitute for, these observation levels.   \n \nBecause death from a suicide attempt can occurs within a short duration, observation of a \nsuicidal inmate at intervals less frequent than continuous observation can only be successful if \nthe observation is staggered and the cell is suicide-resistant. \n \nIn addition, mental health staff should assess and interact with (not just observe) the suicidal \ninmate on a daily basis.  The daily assessment should focus on the current behavior, as well as \nchanges in thoughts and behavior during the past 24 hours (e.g., “What are your current feelings \nand thoughts?” “Have your feelings and thoughts changed over the past 24 hours?” “What are \nsome of the things you have done or can do to change these thought and feelings?,” etc.)  \n \nAn individualized treatment plan (to include follow-up services) should be developed for each \ninmate on suicide precautions.  The plan should be developed by qualified mental health staff in \nconjunction with not only the inmate, but medical and correctional personnel.  The treatment \nplan should describe signs, symptoms, and the circumstances under which the risk for suicide is \nlikely to recur, how recurrence of suicidal thoughts can be avoided, and actions the inmate and \nstaff will take if suicidal ideation reoccurs.   \n \n \n[1220877-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 105   Filed 07/02/14   Page 29 of 30\n \nFinally, due to the strong correlation between suicide and prior suicidal behavior, in order to \nsafeguard  the  continuity  of  care  for  suicidal  inmates,  all  inmates  discharged  from  suicide \nprecautions should remain on mental health caseloads and receive regularly scheduled follow-up \nassessments by mental health personnel until their release from custody. Although there is not \nany nationally-acceptable schedule for follow-up, a suggested assessment schedule following \ndischarge from suicide precautions might be:  24 hours, 72 hours, 1 week, and periodically until \nrelease from custody.  \n \nIntervention \n \nFollowing a suicide attempt, the degree and promptness of the staff’s intervention often foretells \nwhether  the  victim  will  survive.    National  correctional  standards  and  practices  generally \nacknowledge that a facility’s policy regarding intervention should be threefold.  First, all staff \nwho come into contact with the inmate should be trained in standard first aid procedures and \nCPR.    Second,  any  staff  member  who  discovers  an  inmate  engaging  in  self-harm  should \nimmediately survey the scene to assess the severity of the emergency, alert other staff to call for \nmedical personnel if necessary, and begin standard first aid and/or CPR as necessary.  If facility \npolicy prohibits an officer from entering a cell without backup support, the first responding \nofficer should, at a minimum, make the proper notification for backup support and medical \npersonnel, secure the area outside the cell, and retrieve the housing unit’s emergency response \nbag (that should include a first aid kit, pocket mask or face shield, Ambu-bag, and rescue tool). \nThird, correctional staff should never presume that the victim is dead, but rather should initiate \nand continue appropriate life-saving measures until relieved by arriving medical personnel.  In \naddition,  medical  personnel  should  ensure  that  all  equipment  utilized  in  responding  to  an \nemergency within the facility is in working order on a daily basis. \n   \nFinally, although not all suicide attempts require emergency medical intervention, all suicide \nattempts should result in immediate intervention and assessment by mental health staff. \n \nReporting \n \nIn the event of a suicide attempt or suicide, all appropriate officials should be notified through \nthe chain of command.  Following the incident, the victim’s family should be immediately \nnotified, as well as appropriate outside authorities.  All staff who came into contact with the \nvictim  before  the  incident  should  be  required  to  submit  a  statement  including  their  full \nknowledge of the inmate and incident. \n   \n \n[1220877-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 105   Filed 07/02/14   Page 30 of 30\n \nFollow-Up/Mortality-Morbidity Review \n \nAn inmate suicide is extremely stressful for both staff and other inmates.  Staff may also feel \nostracized by fellow personnel and administration officials.  Following a suicide, misplaced guilt \nis sometimes displayed by a correctional officer who wonders: “What if I had made my cell \ncheck earlier?” Inmates are often traumatized by critical events occurring within a facility.  Such \ntrauma may lead to suicide contagion.  When crises occur in which staff and inmates are \naffected by the traumatic event, they should be offered immediate assistance.  One form of \nassistance  is  Critical  Incident  Stress  Debriefing  (CISD).    A  CISD  team,  comprised  of \nprofessionals trained in crisis intervention and traumatic stress awareness (e.g., police officers, \nparamedics, fire fighters, clergy, mental health personnel), provides affected staff and inmates \nan opportunity to process their feelings about the incident, develop an understanding of critical \nstress symptoms, and seek ways of dealing with those symptoms.  For maximum effectiveness, \nthe CISD process or other appropriate support services should occur within 24 to 72 hours of the \ncritical incident. \n \nEvery completed suicide, as well as serious suicide attempt (i.e., requiring medical treatment \nand/or hospitalization), should be examined through a mortality-morbidity review process.  If \nresources permit, clinical review through a psychological autopsy is also recommended.  Ideally, \nthe  mortality-morbidity  review  should  be  coordinated  by  an  outside  agency  to  ensure \nimpartiality.  The review, separate and apart from other formal investigations that may be \nrequired  to  determine  the  cause  of  death,  should  include  a  critical  inquiry  of:  1)  the \ncircumstances surrounding the incident; 2) facility procedures relevant to the incident; 3) all \nrelevant  training  received  by  involved  staff;  4)  pertinent  medical  and  mental  health \nservices/reports involving the victim; 5) possible precipitating factors leading to the suicide or \nserious suicide attempt; and 6) recommendations, if any, for changes in policy, training, physical \nplant, medical or mental health services, and operational procedures. \n \n \nRevised: May 2013 \n \n \n \n[1220877-1] ",

RODNEY BOCK was a loving father and son with a history of mental \n4 illness.  In spite of his psychiatric problems, RODNEY BOCK had run a farm, growing \n5 peaches, prunes, walnuts, and other fresh produce.  He was self-employed, and for thirty \n6 years ran a successful fruit stand business in Marysville, California.  He also operated a \n7 successful, and growing, fertilizer business in the area.  He provided substantial financial \n8 and emotional support to his family, and they remained extremely close to him throughout \n9 his life. \n10 2.  In November 2009, RODNEY BOCK was the victim of an attack in which \n11 he received blows to his head and body.  Soon thereafter, RODNEY BOCK began to \n12 experience substantial psychiatric decompensation.  He would regularly make erratic and \n13 paranoid statements that God and Rush Limbaugh were talking to him and telling him \n14 what to do.  As his delusions and paranoia escalated, his family repeatedly and desperately \n15 sought help from local authorities, including the Sutter County Sheriff’s Department and \n16 Sutter-Yuba Mental Health Services. \n17 3.  RODNEY BOCK’s mental health deterioration starting in November 2009 \n18 led to multiple involuntary hospitalizations for psychiatric evaluation and treatment \n19 pursuant to Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 5150 (“Section 5150”).  During the first two \n20 psychiatric hospitalizations, in November-December 2009 and January-February 2010, \n21 doctors determined that RODNEY BOCK required an additional two-week period of \n22 intensive inpatient treatment in order to provide appropriate care and to stabilize his \n23 condition.  According to his treatment team, which included Defendants BARNETT and \n24 ZIL, RODNEY BOCK’s mental health during this time was extremely fragile, as he \n25 manifested psychotic, delusional and grandiose behaviors, believed that he was \n26 communicating with God, and demonstrated paranoid thoughts.  Defendants BARNETT \n27 and ZIL, as well as other county mental health staff, repeatedly recommended that \n28 RODNEY BOCK be provided a safe and structured setting, intensive mental health \n[1126588-2]    1 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 3 of 82\n \n1 treatment, and ultimately a psychiatric hospital placement. \n2 4.  In late March 2010, RODNEY BOCK abruptly and unexpectedly drove from \n3 California to Idaho, believing that the FBI was following him, that he was communicating \n4 with God and Rush Limbaugh, and that he was acting at God’s direction.  COUNTY OF \n5 SUTTER employees, including Defendants BARNETT and ZIL, documented and were \n6 aware of RODNEY BOCK’s alarming and psychotic behaviors. \n7 5.  RODNEY BOCK’s family promptly brought him to Sutter County’s \n8 psychiatric hospital for emergency evaluation and treatment in April 2010.  Doctors found \n9 that he was “gravely disabled” – that is, that he was unable to provide for his basic \n10 personal needs – and warranted involuntary emergency hospitalization pursuant to Section \n11 5150.  Defendant BARNETT determined that RODNEY BOCK likely required an \n12 additional two (2) weeks of involuntary psychiatric hospitalization.  Yet Defendant \n13 BARNETT discharged RODNEY BOCK from the psychiatric hospital barely 24 hours \n14 after his Section 5150 admission, despite clinical findings that he remained gravely \n15 disabled, could not take care of his basic needs, and was psychotic.  Defendant BARNETT \n16 thus illegally discharged RODNEY BOCK from the hospital with the Section 5150 \n17 involuntary hospitalization order still in place. \n18 6.  Even worse, Defendant BARNETT knowingly discharged RODNEY BOCK \n19 to the custody of the Sutter County Sheriff’s Department pursuant to an outstanding \n20 warrant for detention at Sutter County Jail.  Sutter County Jail (“the Jail”) is not licensed \n21 or otherwise permitted to house individuals subject to Section 5150 involuntary \n22 hospitalization.  Defendant FLIEHMAN, a Sutter County Jail officer, completed the \n23 placement and booking of RODNEY BOCK in the Sutter County Jail knowing that it \n24 could not, and would not, provide anything resembling the level of evaluation, treatment \n25 and supervision that RODNEY BOCK required given his gravely disabled mental health \n26 condition and Section 5150 status. \n27 7.  Defendant FLIEHMAN placed RODNEY BOCK in a general population \n28 single cell with no direct observation for safety, although he knew or should have known \n[1126588-2]    2 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 4 of 82\n \n1 that RODNEY BOCK required at least two (2) weeks of additional involuntary psychiatric \n2 hospitalization given his psychotic condition and inability to provide for his own needs. \n3 8.  For the next 27 days, RODNEY BOCK remained at Sutter County Jail, \n4 where he received woefully inadequate treatment.  Meanwhile, Defendants ZIL, \n5 FLIEHMAN, LITTLE, CALAPINI, RAI, CRANE, MULLIN, and MCGINNIS observed \n6 and were informed of and documented the severity and deterioration of RODNEY \n7 BOCK’s condition. \n8 9.  During this time, as detailed herein, Defendants ZIL, FLIEHMAN, LITTLE, \n9 CALAPINI, RAI, CRANE, MULLIN, and MCGINNIS failed to provide the care and \n10 treatment RODNEY BOCK urgently needed, in spite of readily apparent and known \n11 indicators of RODNEY BOCK’s deterioration, dangerous refusal of critically necessary \n12 psychiatric medications, suicidal thoughts, and need for psychiatric hospitalization. \n13 10.  Meanwhile, Defendants PARKER, MCELFRESH, and BIDWELL knew or \n14 should have known of, yet ignored, a court order explicitly directing that RODNEY BOCK \n15 be placed at Napa State Hospital for inpatient psychiatric hospitalization, in spite of their \n16 statutory and established duties to effectuate such a court-ordered transfer.  Defendants \n17 PARKER, BIDWELL, and MCELFRESH further knew or should have known that Napa \n18 State Hospital had accepted RODNEY BOCK for prompt admission. \n19 11.  The outrageous actions and failures described herein led to RODNEY \n20 BOCK’s further decline in mental health, unnecessary suffering, and ultimately his \n21 preventable suicide at Sutter County Jail on April 29, 2010.  The deliberate indifference \n22 and other misconduct of each Defendant, as described herein, proximately caused \n23 RODNEY BOCK to suffer a violent and psychotic episode, including RODNEY BOCK’s \n24 repeated forceful banging of his head and body against a hard cell wall, causing substantial \n25 bleeding and hemorrhaging, and his hanging himself in his jail cell. \n26 JURISDICTION \n27 12.  This Complaint seeks damages for the violation of the civil rights, privileges, \n28 and immunities, as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United \n[1126588-2]    3 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 5 of 82\n \n1 States Constitution, of RODNEY BOCK, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, and for \n2 violations of California state law.  This Complaint further seeks damages for the violation \n3 of the civil rights, privileges, and immunities, of KIMBERLY BOCK, KELLIE BOCK, \n4 HILLARY BOCK, M.B., LAURA LYNN BOCK, and ROBERT BOCK as guaranteed by \n5 the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and under \n6 California state law. \n7 13.  This Court has jurisdiction over this lawsuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 \n8 and 1343. \n9 14.  This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims asserted \n10 herein pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, since the claims form part of the same case or \n11 controversy arising under the United States Constitution and federal law. \n12 VENUE \n13 15.  Plaintiffs’ claims, alleged herein, arose in the Counties of Sutter and Yuba, \n14 California.

Defendant RAI had direct contact with RODNEY \n18 BOCK in the hours and/or days leading up to his death, had actual notice of RODNEY \n19 BOCK’s psychotic condition, risk for suicide, and need for emergency treatment and \n20 psychiatric hospitalization, and acted with deliberate indifference by failing to take \n21 necessary steps to provide such treatment.

Defendant RAI is being sued in his individual capacity. \n25 39.  The true names and identities of Defendants DOES I through XX are \n26 presently unknown to Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs allege that each of Defendants DOES I through \n27 XX was employed by the COUNTY OF SUTTER, and/or COUNTY OF YUBA, and/or \n28 the Sutter County Sheriff’s Department, and/or SYMHS at the time of the conduct alleged \n[1126588-2]    11 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 13 of 82\n \n1 herein.

RODNEY BOCK was born on August 22, 1953, in Sacramento, California, \n25 and was raised primarily in Sacramento. \n26 47.  RODNEY BOCK and CYNDIE DENNY BOCK had four daughters \n27 together, all of whom had extremely close relationships with their father.  RODNEY \n28 BOCK also was extremely close with his parents and other family members. \n[1126588-2]    13 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 15 of 82\n \n1 48.  Prior to his death, RODNEY BOCK lived on his farm in Marysville, \n2 California.  Two of his daughters, KELLIE BOCK and HILLARY BOCK, lived with him \n3 year-round, and KIMBERLY BOCK lived with him during extended periods each year \n4 consistent with her work obligations.  RODNEY BOCK’s youngest daughter, M.B., stayed \n5 with him several times a month. \n6 49.  RODNEY BOCK worked as a self-employed farmer.  He, along with his \n7 daughters and employees, worked on the farm growing peaches, prunes, walnuts, and other \n8 fresh produce.  RODNEY BOCK owned and operated a successful fruit vending business \n9 along Highway 70 in Marysville, California.  RODNEY BOCK also sold fruit and other \n10 products grown on the farm to vendors.  Additionally, RODNEY BOCK owned and \n11 operated a promising fertilizer business, with a growing number of clients in the area. \n12 50.  RODNEY BOCK had a history of mental illness, but had managed to \n13 maintain a positive family life and to operate his business ventures successfully for thirty \n14 (30) years. \n15 November-December 2009 Mental Health Problems and Section 5150 Hospitalization \n16 51.  In or about November 2009, RODNEY BOCK was the victim of an attack \n17 after an argument with a local resident.  RODNEY BOCK suffered several blows to his \n18 head and body.  Soon thereafter, he began making erratic and paranoid statements.  In one \n19 incident, a game warden observed RODNEY BOCK in an isolated nature area stating that \n20 God was talking to him and telling him to kill people.  The game warden did not arrest \n21 RODNEY BOCK, but told RODNEY BOCK’s family that RODNEY BOCK needed \n22 mental help. \n23 52.  On or about November 26, 2009, RODNEY BOCK’s brother, James Bock, \n24 and/or other family members contacted the Sutter County Sheriff’s Department with \n25 concerns about RODNEY BOCK’s mental health, including his statements that God was \n26 telling him what to do.  The Sutter County Sheriff’s Department held RODNEY BOCK for \n27 several hours, and completed and maintained documentation regarding his mental health \n28 problems. \n[1126588-2]    14 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 16 of 82\n \n1 53.  RODNEY BOCK exhibited delusional and extremely paranoid behavior at \n2 the time of his release on November 26, 2009.  Upon his release, he began wandering the \n3 streets, and his daughter, KELLIE BOCK, found him hiding behind a tree.  There, he told \n4 her that he was being followed and that people were after him. \n5 54.  Later that night, RODNEY BOCK abruptly left his house and went to the \n6 local duck club, where he was a member.  The next day, family members found RODNEY \n7 BOCK behaving extremely erratically at the duck club.  He was acting out based upon \n8 apparent delusions and paranoia.  He refused to return home or to eat.  He spent the night \n9 in a ditch, demanding that family members leave him alone and stating that he wanted to \n10 be with God. \n11 55.  On or about November 27, 2009, family members attempted to have an \n12 “intervention” with RODNEY BOCK, which included a family friend who was a mental \n13 health professional.  RODNEY BOCK told them that he was listening to God.  Family \n14 members contacted county officials, and RODNEY BOCK was admitted to Psychiatric \n15 Emergency Services (PES) at SYMHS for psychiatric evaluation.  Defendant ZIL and \n16 other SYMHS staff completed an evaluation but did not admit him for psychiatric \n17 hospitalization. \n18 56.  On or about November 30, 2009, family members again contacted the Sutter \n19 County Sheriff’s Department based on RODNEY BOCK’s continued paranoia, delusions, \n20 and psychotic behavior.  RODNEY BOCK was taken to the SYMHS Psychiatric Health \n21 Facility, where he was admitted on a 72-hour hold for evaluation and treatment pursuant to \n22 Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 5150. \n23 57.  SYMHS has sixteen (16) inpatient beds for mentally ill patients, with an \n24 average census of approximately nine (9) to eleven (11) patients.  SYMHS clinical, \n25 administrative, and supervisory staff members have, or reasonably should have, knowledge \n26 of all patients held at SYMHS, and their respective psychiatric conditions, at any given \n27 time. \n28 58.  Following a psychiatric exam, RODNEY BOCK was documented as \n[1126588-2]    15 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 17 of 82\n \n1 presenting as psychotic, delusional, and grandiose.  SYMHS staff documented that \n2 RODNEY BOCK had a history of head trauma and a family history that included at least \n3 one completed suicide, that his thought process was “quite scattered and tangential,” and \n4 that his insight and judgment were markedly impaired.  RODNEY BOCK expressed to \n5 SYMHS staff his belief that President Obama was “sending people to kill him.” \n6 59.  Following the 72-hour hold, RODNEY BOCK was certified pursuant to Cal. \n7 Welf. & Inst. Code § 5250 to remain at SYMHS for an additional fourteen (14) days of \n8 involuntary hospitalization, based on a finding that he was a danger to himself or others or \n9 was gravely disabled, as a result of a mental disorder or impairment requiring continued \n10 intensive psychiatric treatment. \n11 60.  During his inpatient treatment at SYMHS, Defendants ZIL and BARNETT, \n12 along with other SYMHS staff, evaluated and treated RODNEY BOCK, identifying \n13 serious psychiatric diagnoses, including:  Bipolar I Disorder, Most Recent Episode Manic, \n14 Severe with Psychotic Features.  An SYMHS Inpatient Services Interdisciplinary \n15 Treatment Team documented staff members’ recommendations that RODNEY BOCK be \n16 provided a “supportive therapeutic milieu” to treat his psychiatric condition. \n17 61.  RODNEY BOCK was never provided a CT scan, MRI, or any other \n18 diagnostic assessment or treatment related to the reported head trauma documented by \n19 Defendant BARNETT and others. \n20 62.  At the time of his discharge on or about December 17, 2009, after a 17-day \n21 hospitalization, RODNEY BOCK’s psychiatric condition and level of functioning \n22 remained precarious.  According to Defendant BARNETT’s evaluation and discharge \n23 summary, RODNEY BOCK required further psychiatric treatment for his serious mental \n24 illness, and Defendant BARNETT was to continue to provide such treatment. \n25 January-February 2010 Mental Health Problems and Inpatient Treatment \n26 63.  On or about January 14, 2010, RODNEY BOCK again became delusional \n27 and paranoid, leading to an incident at a local Applebee’s restaurant.  He made several \n28 erratic statements in the restaurant, and was subsequently arrested by police and taken by \n[1126588-2]    16 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 18 of 82\n \n1 Sutter County Sheriff’s Department to Sutter County Jail.  Criminal charges were filed \n2 against RODNEY BOCK based on this incident. \n3 64.  On or about January 15, 2010, RODNEY BOCK was held at Sutter County \n4 Jail while continuing to manifest his unstable mental health condition.  Custody staff \n5 completed RODNEY BOCK’s Inmate Medical Screening Form.  Jail staff failed to \n6 properly assess or document RODNEY BOCK’s medication needs and his risk for self-\n7 harm or suicide on the Inmate Medical Screening Form. \n8 65.  On or about January 15, 2010, RODNEY BOCK was referred to SYMHS for \n9 a psychiatric evaluation.  SYMHS staff completed a “Jail Outreach” evaluation \n10 documenting RODNEY BOCK’s psychiatric history, which was maintained in RODNEY \n11 BOCK’s custody file and documented his delusions and related serious psychiatric needs. \n12 66.  RODNEY BOCK was subsequently released from custody on bail. \n13 67.  On or about January 25, 2010, RODNEY BOCK’s close friends and family \n14 again became alarmed by his delusional and paranoid behaviors.  RODNEY BOCK’s \n15 family again sought psychiatric treatment for him.  On their request, Sutter County \n16 Sheriff’s Department brought RODNEY BOCK to the SYMHS Psychiatric Health \n17 Facility, where he was admitted on a 72-hour hold for evaluation and treatment pursuant to \n18 Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 5150. \n19 68.  Following his 72-hour hold, RODNEY BOCK was certified pursuant to Cal. \n20 Welf. & Inst. Code § 5250 to remain at SYMHS Psychiatric Health Facility for an \n21 additional fourteen (14) days of involuntary hospitalization, as a result of a mental disorder \n22 or impairment requiring continued intensive psychiatric treatment. \n23 69.  During his inpatient treatment at SYMHS, Defendants BARNETT and ZIL, \n24 along with other SYMHS staff, evaluated and treated RODNEY BOCK. \n25 70.  Defendant BARNETT and other SYMHS staff confirmed and documented \n26 RODNEY BOCK’s serious psychiatric diagnoses, including:  Bipolar I Disorder, Most \n27 Recent Episode Manic, Severe with Psychotic Features.  An SYMHS Inpatient Services \n28 Interdisciplinary Treatment Team documented its recommendation that RODNEY BOCK \n[1126588-2]    17 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 19 of 82\n \n1 be provided a “safe, secure milieu and appropriate level of observation” to treat his \n2 psychiatric condition.  Defendant BARNETT and other SYMHS staff found him to be \n3 “delusional, grandiose, hyperreligious (being ‘led by God’),” “quite psychotic/manic,” and \n4 demonstrating “markedly impaired” insight and judgment.  Defendant BARNETT and \n5 other SYMHS staff identified and documented that RODNEY BOCK required fifteen-\n6 minute safety checks and daily treatment, a clear recognition that RODNEY BOCK was at \n7 risk of serious self-harm, including suicide. \n8 71.  Defendant BARNETT documented that RODNEY BOCK “need[ed] CT \n9 Scan of head [prior to discharge] (will rec[ommend] that) considering [history] of head \n10 injuries.”  Neither Defendant BARNETT nor any other Defendant or county employee \n11 ever ordered or provided this essential diagnostic testing for RODNEY BOCK. \n12 72.  On or about February 12, 2010, after a 17-day hospitalization, RODNEY \n13 BOCK was discharged from SYMHS Psychiatric Health Facility.  Although his \n14 functioning had somewhat improved during the hospitalization, he continued to suffer \n15 from serious psychiatric problems, including delusions and impaired insight and judgment.  \n16 Defendant BARNETT documented that RODNEY BOCK “still remain[ed] somewhat \n17 delusional concerning being driven by God.” \n18 Court-Ordered Evaluations to Determine RODNEY BOCK’s Mental Condition \n19 73.  In light of RODNEY BOCK’s serious and ongoing psychiatric problems, the \n20 court presiding over the pending criminal complaint against RODNEY BOCK expressed \n21 concern about RODNEY BOCK’s condition and mental competency to stand trial.  On or \n22 about January 27, 2010, the Honorable H. Ted Hanson of Sutter County Superior Court \n23 ordered that RODNEY BOCK undergo a psychological evaluation to assist in a \n24 determination of whether he was competent to stand trial and whether he required \n25 psychiatric treatment, including inpatient hospitalization. \n26 74.  On February 22, 2010, Dr. Deborah Schmidt, Ph.D. conducted the court-\n27 ordered psychological evaluation of RODNEY BOCK.  Dr. Schmidt’s findings make clear \n28 that RODNEY BOCK suffered serious psychiatric impairments including: an active \n[1126588-2]    18 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 20 of 82\n \n1 delusional, paranoid, and psychotic state; emotional instability; and high levels of agitation \n2 and excitability – all indicators of a risk of self-harm.  Dr. Schmidt concluded that \n3 RODNEY BOCK’s highly unstable psychiatric condition made him incompetent to stand \n4 trial.  Dr. Schmidt also concluded that RODNEY BOCK required further psychiatric \n5 assessment and more intensive treatment.  This evaluation was placed in a COUNTY OF \n6 SUTTER file on RODNEY BOCK that was readily available to both SYMHS and Jail \n7 staff charged with treating and supervising RODNEY BOCK during his April 2010 \n8 detention. \n9 75.  On or about March 1, 2010, the Hon. Brian R. Aronson of Sutter County \n10 Superior Court ordered a placement evaluation of RODNEY BOCK pursuant to Cal. Penal \n11 Code § 1370. \n12 76.  Dr. Rick Bingham, the Community Program Director for the Sutter-Yuba \n13 Conditional Release Program, completed the court-ordered placement evaluation.  On or \n14 about March 22, 2010, Dr. Bingham documented RODNEY BOCK’s history of \n15 experiencing manic episodes of Bipolar Disorder, and his delusions of a special \n16 relationship with Rush Limbaugh and of receiving messages from God directing his \n17 actions.  Dr. Bingham scheduled an appointment with RODNEY BOCK for March 30, \n18 2010. \n19 March-April 2010 Mental Health Crisis and Section 5150 Hospitalization \n20 77.  In late March 2010, RODNEY BOCK experienced extreme paranoia and \n21 delusions.  Based on delusional beliefs that God was directing him and that he needed to \n22 meet with Rush Limbaugh, RODNEY BOCK abruptly drove to his nephew’s home in \n23 Idaho.  He expressed beliefs that the FBI was following him, that he was openly and \n24 actively communicating with God and Rush Limbaugh, and that he was going to travel \n25 somewhere with Rush Limbaugh by helicopter, among other delusions and hallucinations. \n26 78.  Because of his psychiatric deterioration and the resultant trip to Idaho, \n27 RODNEY BOCK missed a March 29, 2010 court date.  A warrant was issued based on this \n28 missed court date. \n[1126588-2]    19 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 21 of 82\n \n1 79.  On or about March 29, 2010, Dr. Bingham sent another letter to the court, \n2 stating that he retracted his recommendations with respect to the appropriateness of \n3 outpatient treatment for RODNEY BOCK, as contained in the March 22, 2010 placement \n4 evaluation report.  Dr. Bingham indicated that inpatient hospitalization was required.  This \n5 document was placed in a COUNTY OF SUTTER file on RODNEY BOCK that was \n6 readily available to both SYMHS and Jail staff charged with treating and supervising \n7 RODNEY BOCK during his April 2010 detention. \n8 80.  Recognizing his uncle’s severe decompensation and highly unstable \n9 psychiatric state, RODNEY BOCK’s nephew brought RODNEY BOCK back to California \n10 on or about April 1, 2010.  RODNEY BOCK’s family returned him to SYMHS Psychiatric \n11 Health Facility, where he was admitted for a 72-hour period of treatment and evaluation \n12 pursuant to Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 5150. \n13 Improper and Illegal Discharge from Section 5150 Involuntary Hospitalization and \nImproper and Illegal Jail Placement with Direct Knowledge of and Deliberate \n14\nIndifference to RODNEY BOCK’s Serious Treatment Needs \n15 81.  Upon his admission to SYMHS Psychiatric Health Facility on April 1, 2010, \n16 psychiatric staff identified RODNEY BOCK’s highly unstable psychiatric condition as \n17 well as his need for a safe and structured therapeutic setting, including but not limited to \n18 psychiatric hospitalization. \n19 82.  By this time, based on his recent psychotic episodes and repeated admissions \n20 and hospitalizations at SYMHS, RODNEY BOCK’s mental health problems were widely \n21 known by SYMHS clinical, administrative, and supervisory staff, including Defendants \n22 BARNETT and ZIL, who each observed and evaluated him, and identified his psychotic \n23 condition and symptoms indicating a high risk of serious self-harm and suicide. \n24 83.  On or about April 1, 2010, Defendant BARNETT evaluated RODNEY \n25 BOCK and confirmed the diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder, Manic with Severe Psychotic \n26 Features, and recommended necessary interventions that included provision of a “safe and \n27 structured milieu” and “redirection as required [and] observ[ation] for safety.”  Defendant \n28 BARNETT and the Interdisciplinary Treatment Team further documented RODNEY \n[1126588-2]    20 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 22 of 82\n \n1 BOCK’s need for a “state hospital placement.”  Upon information and belief, these \n2 treatment recommendations were made in recognition of RODNEY BOCK’s inability to \n3 provide for his own basic needs and his risk for self-harm and suicide. \n4 84.  On April 2, 2010, Defendant BARNETT determined and documented that \n5 RODNEY BOCK required at least an additional two (2) weeks of involuntary psychiatric \n6 hospitalization pursuant to Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 5250 given his continued bipolar \n7 symptoms, delusions, hallucinations, and inability to safely provide for his own basic \n8 needs. \n9 85.  Yet that very same day, and barely 24 hours after his admission to SYMHS \n10 hospital for a 72-hour period of treatment and evaluation pursuant to Section 5150, \n11 Defendant BARNETT, knowing that RODNEY BOCK required further psychiatric \n12 hospitalization and acting with deliberate indifference to that serious medical need, and \n13 with knowledge that RODNEY BOCK’s symptoms put him at significant risk of self-harm \n14 and suicide, ordered and approved the discharge of RODNEY BOCK for transfer to the \n15 Sutter County Jail. \n16 86.  Defendant BARNETT’s discharge of RODNEY BOCK from the psychiatric \n17 hospital for transfer to Sutter County Jail violated the statutory requirement, as set forth in \n18 Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 5152(a), that such a patient “receive whatever treatment and care \n19 his … condition requires for the full period that he … is held” pursuant to § 5150, and that \n20 he “be released before 72 hours have elapsed only if the psychiatrist directly responsible \n21 for the person’s treatment believes, as a result of the psychiatrist’s personal observations, \n22 that [he] no longer requires evaluation or treatment” (emphasis added).  Defendant \n23 BARNETT discharged RODNEY BOCK for transfer to Sutter County Jail without any \n24 finding that he no longer required evaluation or treatment.  To the contrary, Defendant \n25 BARNETT knew that RODNEY BOCK remained gravely disabled and that psychiatric \n26 hospitalization for a minimum of two (2) more weeks was necessary for the preservation of \n27 life and/or the prevention of serious bodily harm. \n28 87.  At the time of RODNEY BOCK’s discharge from SYMHS on April 2, 2010, \n[1126588-2]    21 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 23 of 82\n \n1 Defendant BARNETT and other SYMHS staff provided a wholly inadequate treatment \n2 plan, stating that the plan was for “law enforcement to come and serve the warrant and \n3 arrest [him] and take him to jail for further Tx [treatment] there.”  Defendant BARNETT \n4 specifically documented observations indicating RODNEY BOCK’s heightened risk for \n5 self-harm and suicide.  He observed and documented that RODNEY BOCK was speaking \n6 of “end times,” “remained quite manic and psychotic,” “was quite grandiose and \n7 delusional with flight of ideas and quite focused on hyper-religious content,” and was \n8 demonstrating “markedly impaired” insight and judgment.  Defendant BARNETT knew or \n9 should have known that such behaviors and symptoms, along with RODNEY BOCK’s \n10 diagnosed condition, put him at significant risk of suicide.  Defendant BARNETT \n11 specifically documented that RODNEY BOCK’s psychiatric condition made him unable to \n12 take care of his basic needs.  Yet, Defendant BARNETT’s discharge plan provided no \n13 adequate plan for treatment. \n14 88.  Defendant BARNETT knew or should have known that Sutter County Jail \n15 could not, and would not, provide the necessary hospital-level treatment that RODNEY \n16 BOCK required, and failed to take steps to prevent the constitutional violations and \n17 foreseeable harm suffered by RODNEY BOCK.  Defendant BARNETT further knew or \n18 should have known that Sutter County Jail could not legally and safely house patients on \n19 involuntary hospitalization status, as provided by Section 5150.  Defendant BARNETT \n20 knew or should have known these facts in part because SYMHS is responsible for the \n21 provision of mental health services to inmates at Sutter County Jail. \n22 89.  Notwithstanding the multiple sources through which Defendant BARNETT \n23 had notice of RODNEY BOCK’s serious treatment needs and significant risk of great \n24 bodily harm, including suicide, Defendant BARNETT acted negligently, illegally, and \n25 with deliberate indifference by discharging RODNEY BOCK from the treatment facility \n26 barely 24 hours after his admission pursuant to Section 5150, despite clinical findings that \n27 he remained gravely disabled, could not take care of his basic needs, and was psychotic.  \n28 Defendant BARNETT illegally discharged RODNEY BOCK from the hospital with the \n[1126588-2]    22 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 24 of 82\n \n1 Section 5150 involuntary hospitalization order still in place, and despite his finding that \n2 RODNEY BOCK required at least two (2) additional weeks of psychiatric hospitalization. \n3 90.  Upon information and belief, Defendants PARKER, MCELFRESH, and \n4 BIDWELL knew of and approved this premature and improper transfer of custody, with \n5 knowledge of RODNEY BOCK’s continued Section 5150 status, as well as his urgent \n6 need for a safe, structured, and intensive hospital treatment setting. \n7 Improper and Illegal Placement in Sutter County Jail \n8 91.  RODNEY BOCK was then transferred by the Sutter County Sheriff’s \n9 Department to Sutter County Jail for booking and placement in pre-trial detention. \n10 92.  At the Jail, Defendant FLIEHMAN improperly completed the booking \n11 process for RODNEY BOCK on April 2, 2010.  Upon information and belief, Defendant \n12 FLIEHMAN was provided and reviewed the SYMHS discharge documentation and other \n13 materials stating that RODNEY BOCK was on Section 5150 status due to grave disability, \n14 was psychotic, grandiose and delusional, with markedly impaired insight and judgment, \n15 and had a diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder, Most Recent Episode Manic, Severe with \n16 Psychotic Features.  Yet Defendant FLIEHMAN permitted RODNEY BOCK’s placement \n17 at Sutter County Jail, knowing that the Jail could not legally house patients on involuntary \n18 hospitalization status, as provided by Section 5150 and Jail directives of which he was or \n19 should have been aware. \n20 93.  On information and belief, Defendant FLIEHMAN further acted negligently, \n21 improperly, and with deliberate indifference in completing the custody assessment and \n22 medical screening process for RODNEY BOCK.  Defendant FLIEHMAN failed to record \n23 any of the following critical mental health information on the screening documentation: \n24 RODNEY BOCK’s psychotic condition, his grave disability preventing him from caring \n25 for his own basic needs, his Section 5150 status, his medication and treatment needs, or his \n26 risk of self-harm and suicide. \n27 94.  As a result of Defendant FLIEHMAN’s negligence and deliberate \n28 indifference, RODNEY BOCK was wrongly admitted to the Jail and placed in a dangerous \n[1126588-2]    23 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 25 of 82\n \n1 general population single cell without appropriate observation for safety.  Defendant \n2 FLIEHMAN knew or should have known that RODNEY BOCK, as an actively psychotic \n3 and delusional patient subject to Section 5150 involuntary psychiatric hospitalization, \n4 could not be safely placed in such a setting, and that such a placement put RODNEY \n5 BOCK at significant risk of serious self-harm and suicide. \n6 95.  Upon information and belief, Defendants PARKER, MCELFRESH, and \n7 BIDWELL knew or should have known of this improper placement in the Jail, with \n8 knowledge of RODNEY BOCK’s continued Section 5150 status and his urgent need for a \n9 safe, structured hospital setting that the Jail could not and would not provide. \n10 96.  From April 2, 2010 until April 29, 2010, RODNEY BOCK was held in \n11 custody at Sutter County Jail as a pretrial detained prisoner. \n12 Defendant ZIL Had Notice of RODNEY BOCK’s Significant Risk of Serious Self-\nHarm and Suicide, and Acted with Deliberate Indifference to His Serious Treatment \n13\nNeeds by Failing to Provide Treatment \n14 97.  SYMHS is responsible for the provision of mental health evaluation, \n15 treatment, and related services to prisoners at Sutter County Jail. \n16 98.  Defendant ZIL was assigned RODNEY BOCK’s treating physician during \n17 his April 2010 detention at Sutter County Jail.  Defendant ZIL was informed by phone and \n18 in writing that RODNEY BOCK was displaying alarming signs and symptoms of serious \n19 mental illness.  Defendant ZIL was further informed of RODNEY BOCK’s diagnosis of \n20 Bipolar I Disorder, Most Recent Episode Manic, Severe with Psychotic Features, and his \n21 need for psychiatric medications.  Upon information and belief, Defendant ZIL was \n22 informed, and thus knew or should have known, that RODNEY BOCK was on Section \n23 5150 status based on grave disability and was psychotic, grandiose and delusional with \n24 markedly impaired insight and judgment. \n25 99.  Defendant ZIL ordered psychiatric medication, including lithium, for \n26 RODNEY BOCK.  Lithium is a psychiatric drug used to treat bipolar disorder and to \n27 reduce the risk of suicide and deliberate self-harm.  Defendant ZIL thus knew or should \n28 have known that RODNEY BOCK was at risk of suicide and required treatment, including \n[1126588-2]    24 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 26 of 82\n \n1 medication.  Defendant ZIL was also informed and aware that RODNEY BOCK was not \n2 compliant with medications, putting him at substantial risk of serious harm.  Defendant \n3 ZIL did not take steps to address this known serious risk: he did not order Direct \n4 Observation Therapy (DOT) to ensure that necessary medication was administered; he did \n5 not order additional evaluation or treatment in light of RODNEY BOCK’s medication non-\n6 compliance and documented deterioration; and he did not order the required \n7 hospitalization that was repeatedly identified as necessary given RODNEY BOCK’s \n8 condition.  It is well known that a basic, and essentially common sense, component of a \n9 minimally adequate and constitutional mental health care delivery system is the adequate \n10 administration of psychiatric medication with appropriate supervision and evaluation.  See \n11 Coleman v. Wilson, 912 F. Supp. 1282, 1298 & n.10 (E.D. Cal. 1995). \n12 100.  Upon information and belief, Defendant ZIL had one clinical contact with \n13 RODNEY BOCK during the April 2010 detention, during which he was again informed \n14 and documented that RODNEY BOCK had previously been in the SYMHS psychiatric \n15 hospital, that he was bipolar and suffering from delusions and other symptoms of mental \n16 illness, and that he did not want to take his psychiatric medications. \n17 101.  Defendant ZIL knew or should have known that Sutter County Jail could not, \n18 and would not, provide the necessary hospital-level treatment that RODNEY BOCK \n19 required, and failed to take steps to prevent the constitutional violations and foreseeable \n20 harm suffered by RODNEY BOCK as a result of the lack of treatment provided at the Jail.  \n21 Upon information and belief, Defendant ZIL further knew or should have known that \n22 Sutter County Jail could not legally house patients on involuntary hospitalization status, as \n23 provided by Section 5150. \n24 102.  Upon information and belief, Defendant ZIL was informed and aware that \n25 RODNEY BOCK was refusing his psychiatric medications and manifesting alarming \n26 behaviors.  Defendant ZIL knew or should have known that RODNEY BOCK’s sudden \n27 and ongoing refusal to take prescribed psychiatric medications, including lithium, \n28 increased the risk of serious self-harm and suicide several-fold. \n[1126588-2]    25 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 27 of 82\n \n1 103.  Defendant ZIL knew or should have known that RODNEY BOCK’s bipolar \n2 diagnoses and the pattern of his symptoms indicated a very high risk of self-harm and \n3 suicide. \n4 104.  Defendant ZIL’s knowledge of RODNEY BOCK’s serious risk of suicide \n5 based on his psychiatric condition are confirmed by his own writings on the subject.  For \n6 example, Defendant ZIL authored a Sutter County Jail Suicide Prevention Handbook, in \n7 which he identified the well-known signs of suicide risk among jail inmates, including \n8 “visual or auditory hallucinations,” “severe paranoia,” “delusions,” and “ideas of \n9 grandeur,” all of which he was aware RODNEY BOCK was suffering.  Defendant ZIL \n10 further wrote that a psychotic condition like the one RODNEY BOCK had, with symptoms \n11 including hallucinations and delusions like those suffered by RODNEY BOCK, presents \n12 “a suicide risk because the inmate may not know what he or she is doing,” and that \n13 immediate attention and treatment must be provided in such cases.  Defendant ZIL thus \n14 clearly knew or should have known that RODNEY BOCK’s serious mental illness, along \n15 with his documented symptoms and refusal of psychiatric medications, placed him at grave \n16 risk of self-harm and suicide.  Defendant ZIL acted with deliberate indifference by not \n17 providing appropriate treatment or ordering a psychiatric hospital placement given his \n18 knowledge of RODNEY BOCK’s life-threatening circumstances. \n19 Defendants PARKER, MCELFRESH, and BIDWELL Had Notice of RODNEY \nBOCK’s Significant Risk of Serious Self-Harm and Suicide and His Court-Ordered \n20\nPsychiatric Hospital Placement, and Acted with Deliberate Indifference by Failing to \nEffectuate the Court-Ordered Transfer or Otherwise Provide Treatment \n21\n22 105.  On or about April 12, 2010, a superior court judge ordered a revised \n23 placement recommendation for RODNEY BOCK.  Dr. Bingham, pursuant to the court-\n24 ordered evaluation, recommended to the court that RODNEY BOCK be placed at Napa \n25 State Hospital for inpatient hospital treatment.  This was placed in a COUNTY OF \n26 SUTTER file on RODNEY BOCK that was readily available to both SYMHS and Jail \n27 staff charged with treating and supervising RODNEY BOCK during his April 2010 \n28 detention. \n[1126588-2]    26 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 28 of 82\n \n1 106.  On or about April 19, 2010, a superior court judge found that RODNEY \n2 BOCK was incompetent to stand trial, ordered that criminal proceedings against RODNEY \n3 BOCK remain suspended, and ordered that RODNEY BOCK be promptly transferred to \n4 the custody of Napa State Hospital for psychiatric hospitalization.  The court order further \n5 directed that RODNEY BOCK be required to take all prescribed anti-psychotic \n6 medications.  This court order was placed in a COUNTY OF SUTTER file on RODNEY \n7 BOCK that was readily available to both SYMHS and Jail staff charged with treating and \n8 supervising RODNEY BOCK during his April 2010 detention. \n9 107.  Defendants PARKER, MCELFRESH, and BIDWELL knew or should have \n10 known of this court-ordered hospital placement.  Defendant PARKER, in his role as Sutter \n11 County Sheriff, has the statutory duty to be informed of any Sutter County Jail inmate that \n12 has been found mentally incompetent and has been ordered transferred to a psychiatric \n13 hospital at Napa State Hospital.  Pursuant to Cal. Penal Code § 1370, it is the sheriff’s duty \n14 to be informed about any order on a prisoner’s lack of mental competency and state \n15 hospital placement, and to complete the delivery of that prisoner to the state hospital.  \n16 Upon information and belief, Defendant MCELFRESH, as Jail Commander and officer in \n17 charge of inmate admissions and discharges, was responsible for completing the prompt \n18 transfer of mentally or medically ill inmates to appropriate out-of-facility placements, \n19 including to mental hospital facilities pursuant to court order.  Upon information and \n20 belief, Defendant BIDWELL, as Jail Lieutenant and second in command of the \n21 Corrections Section, was also responsible for completing the prompt transfer of mentally \n22 or medically ill inmates to appropriate out-of-facility placements, including to mental \n23 hospital facilities pursuant to court order.  Upon information and belief, the court’s order \n24 was transmitted to Sutter County Jail, and Defendants PARKER, MCELFRESH, and \n25 BIDWELL were informed or should have been informed of such order. \n26 108.  Defendant MCELFRESH, upon information and belief, reviewed the \n27 April 19, 2010 court order that RODNEY BOCK be promptly transferred to Napa State \n28 Hospital for inpatient psychiatric hospitalization and be required to take all prescribed anti-\n[1126588-2]    27 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 29 of 82\n \n1 psychotic medications.  The review and implementation of such court orders involving \n2 inmates is a critical function of this position.  Upon information and belief, Defendant \n3 MCELFRESH failed to take necessary steps to effectuate this order. \n4 109.  Defendants PARKER, MCELFRESH and BIDWELL also knew or should \n5 have known that Napa State Hospital was prepared to admit RODNEY BOCK.  Napa State \n6 Hospital had reviewed RODNEY BOCK’s profile and documentation, and had notified \n7 Sutter County that RODNEY BOCK was approved for admission to the hospital.  Upon \n8 information and belief, RODNEY BOCK’s approval for Napa State Hospital admission \n9 was transmitted to Sutter County Jail, and Defendants PARKER, MCELFRESH, and \n10 BIDWELL were informed of such approval. \n11 110.  Defendants PARKER, MCELFRESH, and BIDWELL, and MCELFRESH \n12 failed to complete the court-ordered transfer of RODNEY BOCK to Napa State Hospital \n13 for necessary psychiatric hospitalization.  Defendants PARKER, MCELFRESH, \n14 BIDWELL, and MCELFRESH knew or should have known that the failure to provide \n15 inpatient hospital care to RODNEY BOCK, as an actively psychotic and delusional patient \n16 identified as requiring involuntary psychiatric hospitalization and for whom there was a \n17 state hospital placement and involuntary medication order, placed RODNEY BOCK at \n18 significant risk of serious harm, including self-harm and suicide. \n19 111.  Sutter County’s main jail, where RODNEY BOCK was held in custody, has \n20 a prisoner capacity of approximately 200 prisoners.  Defendants PARKER, MCELFRESH, \n21 and BIDWELL receive and review all written incident reports relating to prisoners and the \n22 operations of Sutter County Jail.  Defendants PARKER, MCELFRESH, and BIDWELL \n23 had, or reasonably should have had, direct knowledge of the Jail’s detention of RODNEY \n24 BOCK, a diagnosed psychotic inmate admitted to the Jail while manifesting psychotic and \n25 delusional symptoms and while subject to Section 5150 involuntary psychiatric \n26 hospitalization. \n27\n28\n[1126588-2]    28 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 30 of 82\n \n1 Defendants LITTLE, CALAPINI, RAI, CRANE, MULLIN, and MCGINNIS Had \nNotice of RODNEY BOCK’s Significant Risk of Serious Self-Harm and Suicide, and \n2\nActed with Deliberate Indifference by Failing to Provide Clearly Necessary \nTreatment \n3\n4 112.  Defendants LITTLE, CALAPINI, RAI, CRANE, MULLIN, and MCGINNIS \n5 each had interactions with and observations of RODNEY BOCK in the days prior to his \n6 death.  Each of these Defendants, as discussed below, observed and documented one or \n7 more of the following indicators that RODNEY BOCK required prompt hospital-level \n8 treatment and was at risk of serious personal harm in his general population, single-cell \n9 setting:  his actively psychotic, delusional condition; his Section involuntary psychiatric \n10 hospitalization status; his refusals of critically necessary psychiatric medications; and his \n11 self-injurious behaviors. \n12 113.  Defendant LITTLE, an officer assigned to RODNEY BOCK’s general \n13 population housing pod, had significant interaction with RODNEY BOCK during his April \n14 2010 detention.  Upon information and belief, Defendant LITTLE knew or should have \n15 known about RODNEY BOCK’s actively psychotic, delusional condition; his involuntary \n16 psychiatric hospitalization status; and his significant risk of serious self-harm and suicide. \n17 114.  As reported by Defendant LITTLE, he observed RODNEY BOCK’s \n18 psychotic patterns of behavior and acts of self-harm.  Following RODNEY BOCK’s death, \n19 Defendant LITTLE reported that he had observed RODNEY BOCK banging himself \n20 against his cell door, yelling about or at people who did not exist, describing various \n21 hallucinations, and refusing his psychiatric medication.  Defendant LITTLE knew or \n22 should have known that this combination and pattern of behaviors put RODNEY BOCK at \n23 serious risk of further self-harm and suicide, and that RODNEY BOCK required \n24 significant and immediate treatment. \n25 115.  Defendant CALAPINI, an officer assigned to RODNEY BOCK’s general \n26 population housing pod, also had significant interaction with RODNEY BOCK during his \n27 April 2010 detention.  Upon information and belief, Defendant CALAPINI knew or should \n28 have known about RODNEY BOCK’s actively psychotic, delusional condition, his Section \n[1126588-2]    29 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 31 of 82\n \n1 5150 involuntary psychiatric hospitalization status, and his significant risk of serious self-\n2 harm, including suicide.  Upon information and belief, Defendant CALAPINI observed \n3 RODNEY BOCK engaging in acts of self-harm in his cell, having delusions and \n4 hallucinations, and refusing his psychiatric medication.  Defendant CALAPINI knew or \n5 should have known that this combination and pattern of behaviors put RODNEY BOCK at \n6 serious risk of further self-harm and suicide, and that RODNEY BOCK required \n7 significant and immediate treatment. \n8 116.  Defendant RAI, an officer assigned to RODNEY BOCK’s general \n9 population housing pod, had significant interaction with RODNEY BOCK during his April \n10 2010 detention.  Defendant RAI knew about RODNEY BOCK’s actively psychotic, \n11 delusional condition and his significant risk of serious self-harm and suicide. \n12 117.  In the days and/or hours prior to RODNEY BOCK’s death, Defendant RAI \n13 was contacted over the jail’s in-cell intercom system by inmates housed in close proximity \n14 to RODNEY BOCK.  Those inmates specifically told Defendant RAI that RODNEY \n15 BOCK was behaving in an extremely erratic and psychotic way, and that he was “going \n16 suicidal.”  In response to this alarming information, Defendant RAI did not go to \n17 physically check on RODNEY BOCK’s safety or condition, did not contact medical or \n18 mental health staff about the inmates’ report that RODNEY BOCK was “going suicidal,” \n19 and did not take any other necessary steps to ensure RODNEY BOCK’s safety.  Defendant \n20 RAI thus was informed and knew that RODNEY BOCK was at serious and imminent risk \n21 of self-harm and suicide, and failed to take even the most basic steps necessary to provide \n22 immediate and life-saving attention and treatment. \n23 118.  Upon information and belief, Defendant CRANE was responsible for \n24 providing mental health and/or medical services at the Jail and had observed RODNEY \n25 BOCK multiple times during his April 2010 detention.  Defendant CRANE was informed \n26 on or about April 24, 2010 that RODNEY BOCK’s condition had deteriorated to an \n27 alarming level; that he was unstable and talking to himself and to inanimate objects; and \n28 that he was refusing his medications. \n[1126588-2]    30 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 32 of 82\n \n1 119.  Defendant CRANE observed and documented on or about April 24, 2010 \n2 that RODNEY BOCK had not taken psychiatric medications for several days, was \n3 experiencing delusions and hallucinations, and was making alarming statements suggesting \n4 suicidal thoughts such as “I am the voice . . . my father in heaven . . . we are going to do \n5 the devils tomorrow.”  Defendant CRANE knew or should have known that this \n6 combination and pattern of behaviors put RODNEY BOCK at serious risk of further self-\n7 harm and suicide, and that RODNEY BOCK required significant and immediate treatment.  \n8 Yet, acting with deliberate indifference to RODNEY BOCK’s treatment needs and risk of \n9 serious harm, Defendant CRANE took no steps to provide treatment, ordering simply \n10 “Follow up PRN [as needed].”  Defendant CRANE never returned to re-evaluate \n11 RODNEY BOCK, who continued to deteriorate until his death a few days later. \n12 120.  Defendant MULLIN, a Sutter County Jail nurse, observed RODNEY BOCK \n13 multiple times, including during medication rounds.  Defendant MULLIN observed and \n14 recorded RODNEY BOCK’s repeated refusals of his psychiatric medications.  Upon \n15 information and belief, Defendant MULLIN observed RODNEY BOCK engaging in acts \n16 of self-harm in his cell, having delusions and hallucinations, and refusing his psychiatric \n17 medication.  Yet, acting with deliberate indifference to RODNEY BOCK’s treatment \n18 needs and risk of serious harm, Defendant MULLIN took no steps to provide treatment or \n19 a necessary psychiatric placement. \n20 121.  Defendant MCGINNIS, a Sutter County Jail nurse, observed RODNEY \n21 BOCK multiple times, including during medication rounds.  Defendant MCGINNIS \n22 observed and recorded RODNEY BOCK’s repeated refusals of his psychiatric \n23 medications.  Upon information and belief, Defendant MCGINNIS observed RODNEY \n24 BOCK engaging in acts of self-harm in his cell, having delusions and hallucinations, and \n25 refusing his psychiatric medication.  Yet, acting with deliberate indifference to RODNEY \n26 BOCK’s treatment needs and risk of serious harm, Defendant MCGINNIS took no steps to \n27 provide treatment or a necessary psychiatric placement. \n28 122.  Defendants MULLIN, MCGINNIS, CRANE, LITTLE, CALAPINI, RAI, \n[1126588-2]    31 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 33 of 82\n \n1 and FLIEHMAN knew or should have known that the abrupt cessation and repeated \n2 refusal of critically necessary psychiatric medication, including lithium, put RODNEY \n3 BOCK at serious risk of self-harm and suicide, and that RODNEY BOCK required \n4 significant and prompt intervention and treatment. \n5 123.  RODNEY BOCK, suffering from serious mental illness, expressed clear \n6 cries for help and indications of his risk for self-harm and suicide.  For example, he \n7 documented on an Inmate Request Form provided to him by Jail staff that his housing \n8 location was “Soon to be Hell!”  Defendants LITTLE, CALAPINI, FLIEHMAN, RAI, \n9 CRANE, MULLIN, and MCGINNIS knew or should have known of this and other \n10 alarming indicators of RODNEY BOCK’s suicide risk and urgent need for psychiatric \n11 treatment. \n12 124.  During the same period that Defendants were observing and interacting with \n13 RODNEY BOCK while he was manifestly mentally ill during his April 2010 detention, \n14 RODNEY BOCK’s family members, including KIMBERLY BOCK, KELLIE BOCK, \n15 HILLARY BOCK, and LAURA LYNN BOCK visited him at Sutter County Jail.  They \n16 observed RODNEY BOCK’s substantial physical and psychiatric deterioration.  They \n17 observed that SYMHS and jail staff demonstrated little to no concern about RODNEY \n18 BOCK’s worsening condition. \n19 125.  On April 26, 2010, family members visited RODNEY BOCK at Sutter \n20 County Jail and observed him in a crisis-level condition.  His physical appearance was \n21 severely deteriorated:  he was unshaven, had bags under his eyes, and was visibly \n22 exhausted.  He also demonstrated highly delusional and paranoid behaviors, making \n23 statements relating to his need to die.  RODNEY BOCK’s family members were deeply \n24 distressed and felt helpless to get him the hospital treatment he needed. \n25 126.  Defendants ZIL, LITTLE, CALAPINI, FLIEHMAN, RAI, CRANE, \n26 MULLIN, and MCGINNIS failed to do a complete and adequate suicide risk assessment \n27 for RODNEY BOCK between the time of his transfer to Sutter County Jail on April 2, \n28 2010, and his suicide on April 29, 2010, despite his readily observable psychiatric \n[1126588-2]    32 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 34 of 82\n \n1 symptoms, well-established indicators of suicide risk, and expressions of delusional and \n2 suicidal thoughts.  It is well known that a basic, and essentially common sense, component \n3 of a minimally adequate and constitutional mental health care delivery system is an \n4 adequate program to identify, treat, and supervise inmates at risk for suicide.  See Coleman \n5 v. Wilson, 912 F. Supp. 1282, 1298 & n.10 (E.D. Cal. 1995). \n6 127.  RODNEY BOCK was placed in a cell at Sutter County Jail that was \n7 inappropriate for a person in his unstable condition and in need of inpatient psychiatric \n8 care.  He was placed in a general population cell that provided for no direct observation for \n9 safety.  He was further placed in a single cell, which is well known to be inappropriate for \n10 inmates at elevated risk of self-harm and suicide. \n11 128.  Jail custody staff had live access to streaming footage of inmate activities \n12 and movement, broadcast in a central location inside the Jail, at all times relevant times \n13 mentioned herein.  Defendants LITTLE, CALAPINI, FLIEHMAN, RAI, and other Jail \n14 staff could have and should have, as pursuant to their job duties, observed RODNEY \n15 BOCK’s erratic and alarming behavior through observation of this live video feed. \n16 129.  Defendants ZIL, LITTLE, CALAPINI, FLIEHMAN, RAI, CRANE, \n17 MULLIN, and MCGINNIS, as a result of their own deliberate indifference, negligence, \n18 and insufficient training and supervision, failed to follow the Sutter County Jail’s own \n19 written policies and procedures, which provided that “Inmates with suspected mental \n20 disorders, who are a potential danger to themselves or others or appear to be gravely \n21 disabled shall be promptly evaluated and, if clinically indicated, transferred to an \n22 appropriate psychiatric treatment facility. . . .  Regardless of the time of presentation, \n23 significantly disordered behavior should be evaluated promptly, within twenty-four hours \n24 at the latest.  The Jail Lieutenant or Jail Facility Manager will be contacted and will make \n25 every effort to transfer mentally disordered inmates to appropriate treatment facilities.  All \n26 attempts and efforts to implement the transfer of such inmates, whether successful or not, \n27 shall be documented.” \n28 130.  The failure of Jail custody staff Defendants FLIEHMAN, LITTLE, \n[1126588-2]    33 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 35 of 82\n \n1 CALAPINI, and RAI to contact medical services for emergency treatment was consistent \n2 with a policy in effect at Sutter County Jail that custody staff did not have authority to \n3 determine who would go to the hospital, despite the lack of 24-hour medical staff \n4 availability at the jail.  This policy is evidenced by an e-mail from Defendant PARKER to \n5 a reporter explaining the circumstances of another death at the Sutter County Jail due to \n6 failure to provide basic life-saving care, less than one year after RODNEY BOCK died.  \n7 Defendants PARKER, MCELFRESH, and BIDWELL created, were aware of, and \n8 enforced this policy, knowing that it would endanger inmates like RODNEY BOCK who \n9 require emergency psychiatric and medical attention. \n10 131.  Upon information and belief, Defendants BIDWELL and MCELFRESH \n11 knew or should have known of RODNEY BOCK’s need for emergency treatment.  Despite \n12 their defined duties to transfer mentally disordered inmates to an appropriate treatment \n13 facility, Defendants BIDWELL and MCELFRESH failed to take necessary steps to \n14 complete such a transfer for RODNEY BOCK. \n15 RODNEY BOCK’s Urgent Need for Psychiatric Treatment Was Obvious and Was \nKnown, or Should Have Been Known, by Defendants \n16\n17 132.  RODNEY BOCK’s appearance and alarming behaviors, as discussed supra, \n18 made it obvious that his psychiatric condition was greatly decompensated and put him at \n19 risk for serious personal harm, including self-harm and suicide. \n20 133.  Defendants ZIL, LITTLE, CALAPINI, FLIEHMAN, RAI, CRANE, \n21 MULLIN, and MCGINNIS, who, upon information and belief, observed, interacted with, \n22 and reviewed records of RODNEY BOCK, knew or should have known that RODNEY \n23 BOCK’s psychiatric and medical situation during his detention at the Jail was dire, and \n24 that he immediately required emergency treatment, including hospitalization. \n25 134.  Defendants ZIL, LITTLE, CALAPINI, FLIEHMAN, RAI, CRANE, \n26 MULLIN, and MCGINNIS further knew or should have known that RODNEY BOCK was \n27 at risk for serious personal harm, including deliberate self-harm and suicide, based on the \n28 following: \n[1126588-2]    34 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 36 of 82\n \n1 a.  Doctors had found that RODNEY BOCK was so “gravely disabled” \n2 as to be unable to provide for his most basic personal needs and to require involuntary \n3 emergency psychiatric hospitalization pursuant to Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 5150.  Under \n4 California law, such involuntary emergency hospitalization is appropriate where “action to \n5 impose treatment over the person’s objection is immediately necessary for the preservation \n6 of life or the prevention of serious bodily harm.”  Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 5008.  \n7 Defendants knew or should have known that RODNEY BOCK’s Section 5150 status as a \n8 “gravely disabled” patient indicated the need for hospital treatment to preserve life and \n9 prevent serious bodily harm. \n10 b.  It was and is well known that Sutter County Jail cannot legally or \n11 appropriately house patients subject to Section 5150 hospitalization, and is not equipped to \n12 provide the setting, supervision, and treatment to address the serious needs of such \n13 patients. \n14 c.  It was and is well known in the medical and corrections community \n15 that the type of bipolar disorder with which RODNEY BOCK was diagnosed immediately \n16 prior to his April 2010 detention is associated with a high frequency of both completed \n17 suicides and suicide attempts. \n18 d.  It was and is well known in the medical and corrections community \n19 that lithium is regularly prescribed to reduce an identified risk of suicide.  It is further well \n20 known that the abrupt discontinuation of lithium medication increases the risk of suicide \n21 several-fold, and warrants prompt medical and psychiatric intervention. \n22 e.  Defendants responsible for providing care and ensuring the safety of \n23 Sutter County Jail prisoners were on notice of constitutional requirements for the provision \n24 of mental health care to prisoners by virtue of the well-publicized decision in Coleman v. \n25 Wilson, 912 F. Supp. 1282 (E.D. Cal. 1995), and subsequent orders in the Coleman \n26 litigation, which describe in detail the essential components of constitutionally adequate \n27 mental health care in California state prisons, including appropriate staffing, provision of \n28 services, supervision, and suicide prevention procedures.  Defendants, knowing that such \n[1126588-2]    35 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 37 of 82\n \n1 constitutional obligations also apply with respect to the treatment of county jail prisoners, \n2 failed to take steps to provide constitutionally mandated mental health care and to prevent \n3 the foreseeable harm suffered by RODNEY BOCK. \n4 The Failure to Provide Necessary and Emergency Treatment, Hospitalization, and \nLife-Saving Care Resulted in RODNEY BOCK’s Tragic and Preventable Death \n5\n6 135.  On information and belief, at approximately 7:00 pm on April 29, 2010, \n7 Defendants LITTLE and CALAPINI conducted an hourly safety check and medication \n8 round in RODNEY BOCK’s housing pod.  Such hourly safety checks themselves \n9 constituted inadequate supervision of RODNEY BOCK’s safety and well-being given his \n10 psychotic condition and high risk of suicide. \n11 136.  RODNEY BOCK refused his medication at that time, stating that he did not \n12 take medications anymore.  Defendants LITTLE and CALAPINI took no action to address \n13 this dangerous medication refusal, which carries a known increased risk of self-harm and \n14 suicide.  Defendants LITTLE and CALAPINI further failed to conduct the 8:00 pm hourly \n15 safety check of RODNEY BOCK.  Defendants LITTLE and CALAPINI knew or should \n16 have known that the failure to observe RODNEY BOCK on a consistent basis significantly \n17 jeopardized his safety and well-being. \n18 137.  During the approximately one hour and forty-five minutes about 7:00 pm, in \n19 which he was not observed for safety in any way, RODNEY BOCK’s untreated mental \n20 illness led him to engage in extensive and violent behaviors in his cell, causing massive \n21 injuries including significant bleeding and hemorrhaging on his face, several parts of his \n22 head, and throughout his body. \n23 138.  Using items in his cell that should not have been present in the cell of a \n24 person manifesting RODNEY BOCK’s decompensated psychiatric condition, including \n25 clothing that could be fashioned into a noose and affixed to dangerous attachment points \n26 on the upper portion of the cell’s bed, RODNEY BOCK hanged himself. \n27 139.  Defendants LITTLE, CALAPINI, FLIEHMAN, and MCGINNIS, who, upon \n28 information and belief, were present in the housing pod and responsible for inmates’ safety \n[1126588-2]    36 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 38 of 82\n \n1 at the time of the incident, failed to timely respond and provide life-saving intervention or \n2 treatment.  This failure was the result of their own deliberate indifference, negligence and \n3 inadequate training and supervision to render psychiatric and medical treatment to inmates. \n4 140.  After nearly two hours without any supervision, RODNEY BOCK’s body \n5 was found hanging from the upper bunk bed in his cell.  Substantial amounts of RODNEY \n6 BOCK’s blood covered the floor and walls of his cell. \n7 141.  RODNEY BOCK died in his cell on the evening of April 29, 2010, at the age \n8 of 56. \n9 Longstanding and Systemic Deficiencies in Sutter County Jail’s Provision of \nTreatment to Inmates, Suicide Prevention Measures, and Other Relevant Matters \n10\n11 142.  As identified by a Sutter County Grand Jury in its 2010-2011 Final Report, \n12 Sutter County Jail has several known deficiencies in its system of providing mental health \n13 and medical treatment to inmates.  (The Sutter County Grand Jury Report is appended as \n14 Attachment A.) \n15 143.  Identified deficiencies included inadequate medical staffing, lack of required \n16 training on suicide prevention and other medical treatment, non-compliant medical policies \n17 and procedures, and a medical program that was long out-of-compliance.  The Grand Jury \n18 noted that such deficiencies were “unacceptable,” and may have caused Sutter County to \n19 be out of compliance with an existing court order in Haller v. Sutter County, Case No. \n20 CIV-S-93-1256, which mandates certain jail conditions affecting the treatment of inmates. \n21 144.  The Grand Jury found that medical staffing at Sutter County Jail has been \n22 inadequate, and that the hiring of additional staff is required. \n23 145.  The Grand Jury noted a report that training of staff nurses had not occurred \n24 in more than five (5) years as of 2011, and that such training was necessary to maintain \n25 proficiency in emergency response procedures.  The Grand Jury found that Sutter County \n26 Jail had failed to offer medical staff required training pursuant to court order and the jail’s \n27 own Medical Policies and Procedures. \n28 146.  The Grand Jury found that Sutter County Jail’s health care policies and \n[1126588-2]    37 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 39 of 82\n \n1 procedures were significantly out of date, and that the situation had been allowed to \n2 “deteriorate.” \n3 147.  The Grand Jury found that Sutter County Jail’s nursing program was \n4 “completely out of compliance with annual nurse training updates and standard nursing \n5 procedures,” and found “unacceptable that the program is out of compliance, lack of \n6 training for the nursing staff, [and] not having the [policies and procedures] up-to-date,” \n7 among other problems. \n8 148.  Sutter County Jail has recently experienced several likely preventable inmate \n9 deaths in custody.  In addition to RODNEY BOCK’s death, an inmate died in or about \n10 January 2011 after languishing for several hours with an infection that led to fatal \n11 pneumonia despite Jail staff observing visible signs of serious illness, including the inmate \n12 coughing up substantial amounts of blood.  Another inmate died in or about September \n13 2011 after displaying signs of intoxication that, upon information and belief, went ignored \n14 by Jail staff.  Like RODNEY BOCK, these Jail inmates died as a result of deliberate \n15 indifference to serious medical needs at Sutter County Jail.  This pattern of tragic deaths \n16 supports an inference that COUNTY OF SUTTER Defendants are promoting and \n17 maintaining a culture of deliberate indifference to human life at the Jail. \n18 RODNEY BOCK’s Family Have Suffered Serious and Permanent Injury as a Result \nof Defendants’ Deliberate Indifference and Other Misconduct \n19\n20 149.  As a direct and proximate result of the acts and/or omissions of Defendants, \n21 Plaintiffs KIMBERLY BOCK, KELLIE BOCK, HILLARY BOCK, M.B., LAURA \n22 LYNN BOCK, and ROBERT BOCK suffered the following injuries and damages: \n23 a.  Violation of their due process rights under the First and Fourteenth \n24 Amendments to the United Stated Constitution; \n25 b.  Conscious, needless physical pain and suffering, emotional distress, \n26 hardship, suffering, shock, worry, anxiety, sleeplessness, illness, trauma, suffering, and the \n27 loss of the services, society, care, and protection of the decedent; \n28 c.

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 149, as \n14 though fully set forth herein. \n15 151.  Defendants knew that there was a strong likelihood that RODNEY BOCK \n16 was in danger of serious personal harm, including self-harm and suicide. \n17 152.  Defendants failed to provide necessary mental health evaluation and \n18 treatment and adequate observation for safety for RODNEY BOCK while he was held at \n19 SYMHS and Sutter County Jail, and failed to ensure necessary hospital-level treatment \n20 despite his obvious psychotic state, Section 5150 status, high risk of harming himself, and \n21 need for inpatient psychiatric hospital treatment, as determined by a psychiatric evaluation \n22 and as ordered by a court. \n23 153.

The aforementioned acts and/or omissions of Defendants in being \n18 deliberatively indifferent to RODNEY BOCK’s serious medical needs, health and safety \n19 and violating RODNEY BOCK’s civil rights were the direct and proximate result of \n20 customs, practices and policies of Defendants COUNTY OF SUTTER and COUNTY OF \n21 YUBA, by and through their agencies, employees and/or agents, as alleged herein. \n22 158.

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 172, as \n7 though fully set forth herein. \n8 174.  Defendant ZIL failed to comply with professional standards in the treatment \n9 of RODNEY BOCK’s serious mental illness by failing to provide appropriate assessment \n10 and evaluation, failing to prescribe appropriate psychiatric medications, failing to ensure \n11 compliance with those medications, and failing to ensure appropriate treatment including \n12 suicide precautions. \n13 175.  Defendant BARNETT failed to comply with professional standards in the \n14 treatment of RODNEY BOCK’s serious mental illness by failing to provide appropriate \n15 assessment and evaluation, failing to prescribe appropriate psychiatric medications, failing \n16 to ensure compliance with those medications, and failing to ensure appropriate treatment \n17 including suicide precautions.  Defendant BARNETT also violated professional and legal \n18 standards by discharging RODNEY BOCK from SYMHS to Sutter County Jail in early \n19 April 2010 without finding that RODNEY BOCK no longer required evaluation or \n20 treatment, and without ensuring that appropriate treatment would be provided to RODNEY \n21 BOCK. \n22 176.  As a direct and proximate cause of this negligence and failure to meet the \n23 professional standards of care, RODNEY BOCK and Plaintiffs suffered injuries and \n24 damages as alleged herein. \n25 177.

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 177, as \n6 though fully set forth herein. \n7 179.  Defendant BARNETT violated Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 5152, which \n8 requires that individuals found to require Section 5150 involuntary psychiatric \n9 hospitalization may not be released from the hospital before 72 hours has elapsed absent a \n10 finding that the patient no longer requires evaluation or treatment.  Defendant BARNETT \n11 ordered and approved the discharge of RODNEY BOCK nearly 48 hours prior to the 72-\n12 hour period had elapsed, despite an affirmative finding that he continued to require \n13 treatment for at least two (2) additional weeks. \n14 180.  Defendant FLIEHMAN violated Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 5150, which \n15 requires that an officer taking an involuntarily hospitalized Section 5150 patient into \n16 custody must place such an individual “facility designated by the county and approved by \n17 the State Department of Mental Health as a facility for 72-hour treatment and evaluation.”  \n18 Defendant FLIEHMAN, who knew or should have known that Sutter County Jail is not \n19 such a designated facility and cannot legally house Section 5150 patients, completed the \n20 booking and admission of RODNEY BOCK.  Defendant FLIEHMAN knew or should \n21 have known that RODNEY BOCK remained on Section 5150 status at the time of such \n22 placement in Sutter County Jail. \n23 181.  Defendants BARNETT and FLIEHMAN, acting negligently and improperly, \n24 breached their respective duties, and as a direct and proximate result, RODNEY BOCK \n25 and Plaintiffs suffered injuries and damages as alleged herein. \n26 182.  RODNEY BOCK’s injuries are among the harms that the above-described \n27 statutory provisions were designed to prevent, including among seriously mentally ill \n28 individuals like RODNEY BOCK. \n[1126588-2]    45 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 47 of 82\n \n1 183.  The negligent conduct of Defendants was committed within the course and \n2 scope of their employment. \n3 SEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n4 Failure to Furnish/Summon Medical Care \n(Survival Action – Cal. State Law) \n5 (Against Defendants BOBBY JOE LITTLE, DAVID CALAPINI, SHAUN \nFLIEHMAN, BALJINDER RAI, RAINBOW CRANE, KATY MULLIN, DONICE \n6 MCGINNIS, and DOES I-XL) \n7 184.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 183, as \n8 though fully set forth herein. \n9 185.  Defendants owed RODNEY BOCK a duty of care to provide him immediate \n10 medical and mental health care. \n11 186.  The conduct of Defendants alleged herein, including but not limited to the \n12 facts that Defendants knew or had reason to know that RODNEY BOCK was in need of \n13 immediate medical and mental health care and that Defendants failed to take reasonable \n14 action to summon or provide that care, resulting in RODNEY BOCK’s death as alleged \n15 herein, violated California state law, including Cal. Govt. Code §§ 844.6 and 845.6. \n16 187.  Defendants failed to timely respond to RODNEY BOCK’s psychotic \n17 episode, in which he engaged in numerous acts of self-harm before hanging himself from \n18 the upper bunk bed in his cell. \n19 188.  The alleged conduct of Defendants was committed within the course and \n20 scope of their employment. \n21 189.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ breach, RODNEY BOCK \n22 and Plaintiffs suffered injuries and damages causing great pain and leading to his death, as \n23 alleged herein. \n24 190.  The aforementioned acts of Defendants were willful, wanton, malicious, and \n25 oppressive, thereby justifying an award of exemplary and punitive damages to punish the \n26 wrongful conduct alleged herein and to deter such conduct in the future.  Plaintiffs seek \n27 exemplary and punitive damages against non-medical Defendants only (i.e., Defendants \n28 LITTLE, CALAPINI, RAI, and FLIEHMAN) as to this cause of action.  \n[1126588-2]    46 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 48 of 82\n \n1 EIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n2 Negligent Supervision, Training, Hiring and Retention \n(Survival Action – Cal.

Defendant COUNTY OF SUTTER has a duty to hire, supervise, train, and \n7 retain employees and/or agents so that employees and/or agents refrain from the conduct \n8 alleged herein. \n9 193.  Defendant COUNTY OF SUTTER breached this duty, causing the conduct \n10 alleged herein.  Such breach constituted negligent hiring, supervision, training and \n11 retention under the laws of the State of California. \n12 194.  Defendant COUNTY OF SUTTER’s failure resulted in the violation of two \n13 (2) statutes that establish a specific duty of care and/or basis for liability:  first, the \n14 violation of Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 5152, which requires that individuals found to \n15 require Section 5150 involuntary psychiatric hospitalization may not be released from the \n16 hospital before 72 hours has elapsed absent a finding that the patient no longer requires \n17 evaluation or treatment; and second, violation of Cal. Govt. Code § 845.6, which requires \n18 the timely summoning of emergency care for Jail inmates. \n19 195.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s failure, RODNEY BOCK \n20 and Plaintiffs suffered injuries and damages as alleged herein. \n21 NINTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n22 Wrongful Death, Cal.

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 195, as \n27 though fully set forth herein. \n28 197.  RODNEY BOCK’s death was a direct and proximate result of the \n[1126588-2]    47 \nFIFTH AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND STATE LAW \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 49 of 82\n \n1 aforementioned wrongful and/or negligent acts and/or omissions of Defendants.  \n2 Defendants’ acts and/or omissions thus were also a direct and proximate cause of \n3 Plaintiffs’ injuries and damages, as alleged herein. \n4 198.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ wrongful and/or negligent \n5 acts and/or omissions, Plaintiffs incurred expenses for funeral and burial expenses in an \n6 amount to be proved. \n7 199.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ wrongful and/or negligent \n8 acts and/or omissions, Plaintiffs suffered the loss of the services, society, care and \n9 protection of the decedent, as well as the loss of the present value of his future services to \n10 his family.  Plaintiffs are further entitled to recover prejudgment interest. \n11 200.  Plaintiff Estate of RODNEY BOCK is entitled to recover punitive damages \n12 against individual Defendants who, with conscious disregard of RODNEY BOCK’s rights, \n13 failed to provide RODNEY BOCK with mental health treatment services meeting the \n14 professional standard of practice and failed to adhere to the legal mandates of prisoner \n15 supervision. \n16 201.  The aforementioned acts of Defendants were willful, wanton, malicious, and \n17 oppressive, thereby justifying an award to Plaintiffs of exemplary and punitive damages to \n18 punish the wrongful conduct alleged herein and to deter such conduct in the future.  \n19 Plaintiffs seek exemplary and punitive damages against non-medical Defendants only (i.e., \n20 Defendants COUNTY OF SUTTER, COUNTY OF YUBA, PARKER, MCELFRESH, \n21 BIDWELL, LITTLE, CALAPINI, RAI and FLIEHMAN) as to this cause of action.  \n22 PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n23 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for the following relief: \n24 1.

We were privileged to be selected a year ago to serve on \nthe Sutter County Grand Jury as “a voice of the people and conscience of the \ncommunity.” We took our work seriously and did our best to approach our reviews and \ninvestigations objectively and thoroughly.  \nIt has been a year of learning and hard work in gaining new insights; some were \nfrustrations, and some were fun. We have all had personal growth in this Grand Jury \nexperience. As is with any new Grand Jury, eighteen independent individuals with \ndistinctive talents and skills successfully formed cohesive efforts to make their \ncontribution to the citizens of this county. Members of this Jury have dedicated countless \nhours of work investigating, compiling, debating, and writing these reports. Each member \nof this Grand Jury contributed greatly to this report. I am proud of my fellow jurors and \nall they have accomplished. \nThis year was Judge Brian Aronson second year as the supervising judge for the Grand \nJury. We would like to thank Judge Aronson, together we have learned a lot. To complete \nour work, we had the assistance of the county's court staff, particularly Christine Dagnino \nand Jackie Laswell. Each staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful. Our \nthanks to District Attorney Carl Adams and his staff who assisted us along the way taking \nour phone calls and providing us with the information we needed to perform our duties as \nmembers of the Grand Jury. We commend District Attorney Carl Adams dedication of \ntime as the legal advisor for the Grand Jury for the past twenty-eight years. The Court \nSecurity Staff was very helpful as we navigated unfamiliar territory around the \ncourthouse.

The complaint alleged illegal practices, lack of \ntraining, out of compliant policies/procedures and poor inmate medical care. \nThe Grand Jury established an Adhoc Committee to undertake an investigation to \ndetermine these allegations on the complaint. Interviews were held with supervisors, \nmanagers, and staff of the Sutter County Jail. The Adhoc Committee completed an \ninvestigation of this complaint and made a number of recommendations resulting from \nthat investigation. \nDiscussion \nThe Sutter County Jail Nurses program is to ensure provision of emergency and basic \nhealth care services to individuals who are in custody. Nursing Staff provides health care \nto the incarcerated from booking until the time of release. Along with the Physician and \nNurse Practitioner, there is a Jail Nurse Manager, a Supervising Registered Nurse (SRN) , \nthree Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVN)'s  and 7-8 contract LVN's. Since November \n2010, the county has an open position for a second SRN. \nThe Grand Jury felt the allegations in the complaint were serious and needed to be \ninvestigated. \nThe complaint alleges the following: \nInadequate R.N. Coverage \nAccording to the complaint, per Legal Decree #CIV- S-93-1256 DFL JFM (P) of \nDempsey W. Haller, et al. vs. The County of Sutter, et al. (see attachment, A) states in \npart: \nE. 2. Staffing:  \"Jail medical staffing is the responsibility of the County's Human \nServices Department and shall consist of at least one registered nurse on site during either \nthe day shift or the evening shift seven days per week, and either one registered nurse or \none L VN on site during the other day shift or evening shift as appropriate, seven days per \nweek ... \" \nPrior to the resignation of a SRN, there was one SRN and LV  N on the day shift or one \nSRN and LV  N on the night shift. There was an incident when the SRN on the night shift \nbecame ill while on duty. The SRN called in a LV  N for backup. The SRN was \nreprimanded by the Jail Nurse Manager in an email that there should have been a \nRegistered Nurse on duty. The SRN was referred to legal decree #CIV-S-93-1256 DFL \n8 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 63 of 82\nJFM (P) against Sutter County, which states the requirement. The SRN was not told of \nthis legal decree prior to this incident. According to the staff, there had been 20 days so \nfar that year that this had occurred. During the investigation, it was noted that this was a \ncommon occurrence since there were only two SRNs. \nLack of Training \nAccording to the complaint training of staff nurses has not occurred in more than five (5) \nyears. Annual onsite training is necessary to maintain proficiency in emergency response \nprocedures. \nBefore the SRN resigned, the SRN requested onsite training. The SRN's request was \nrefused by the Jail Nurse Manager. The SRN put together training on Emergency \nResponse in the jail. The SRN asked for a review ofthe materials and the Jail Nurse \nManager refused to even look at the class outline. The SRN held the class with a few \nnurses and correctional staff in attendance. \nOut of Compliant Policies and Procedures \nThe complaint alleged the Jail Nurses Program is out of compliance with California State \ncorrectional code - Title 15 sec 1206 Policy and Procedures (P&P) are to be reviewed \nannually. Standardized Nursing Procedures (SNP) have not been reviewed or updated \nsince 1995. The SNP has been changed with pencil marks. \nThe nursing staff has inquired as to why these P&P's and the SNP's are outdated. The \nJail Nursing Manager's answer is lack oftime prevents him from completing the task. \nFinding \nInadequate R.N. Coverage \nThe Nurse staffing at the Jail has been directed by a court order in Dempsey W. Haller \nvs. Sutter County, et al. No. CIV -S-93-1256 DFL JFM (P). Failure to comply with this \norder Sutter County can be found out-of-compliance and could be liable for additional \naction by the Court. \nRecommendation \nEvery effort should be made to hire an additional SRN and ensure one is available for \neither the AM shift or the PM shift. The Nursing Program Manager needs to take a more \nactive role in managing the Jail Nursing Program. Once the SRN position is filled, the \nNursing Program Manager, who is also an RN, must be utilized to ensure the Jail Nursing \nProgram is in compliance with the court order. \n9 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 64 of 82\nThe Assistant Director of Health and Human Services should provide oversight to insure \nthe Jail Nursing Program is in full compliance with court order Legal decree #CIV -S-93-\n1256 DLF JFM (P). \nFinding \nLack of Training \nLegal decree #CIV-S-93-1256 DLF JFM (P) \nE 19. Training: \"Jail custody staff shall receive periodic update training in First Aid, CPR, \nintake screening, blood borne pathogens and suicide prevention ... \" \nSutter County Jail Medical Policies and Procedures #3 Section 6. \"Oversees training of \nnurses and/or officers in areas where improvement is needed, as identified by QA audits, \nincluding regular and continued joint staff development activities. These will be \ndocumented as to date given, content, attendees and comments.\" \nTraining is necessary to maintain proficiency in on-site activities. The Nursing Program \nManager has failed to offer his nursing staff any of the required training. When one of his \nSRN's put together an emergency response training class he refused to review the course \noutline before the class was held. \nRecommendation \nThe Grand Jury recommends the Nursing Program Manager along with the Medical \nOfficer, develop a training program to ensure adequate on-site training be made available \nto the nursing staff on a regular basis. The Assistant Director of Health and Human \nServices should provide oversight to ensure this training program is implemented. \nFinding \nOut of Compliance Policies and Procedures \nTitle 15 Regulations 1206. Health Care Procedure Manual \"The health authority shall in \ncooperation with the facility administrator, set forth in writing, policies and procedures in \nconformance with applicable State and Federal law, which are reviewed and updated at \nleast annually ... \" \nDuring the investigation, it was stated unanimously that the P&P's were significantly out \nof-date. The County Medical Officer is responsible for making sure the P&P's are current \nby signing them annually. The Jail Nurse Program Manager has overall responsibility to \nsee that the Nursing Program policies and procedures are operational and functioning in \nthe scope as laid out in the Standard Nursing Procedures. The Jail Nurse Program \nManager has not done this. When the Jail Nurse Program Manager was hired, the P&P's \nwere not up to date. By not correcting these problems, his inaction has allowed this \n10 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 65 of 82\nsituation to deteriorate further. The Jail Nurse Program Manager indicated it would take \nover a year to complete. This should be made a priority. \nRecommendation \nThe County Medical Officer and the Jail Nurse Program Manager with oversight from \nthe Assistant Director of Health and Human Services should ensure the Jail Nursing \nProgram P&P's are reviewed, rewritten, and made current so they can be used and \nreferred to by the jail staff. The Standard Nursing Procedures has been changed with \npencil marks and needs to be corrected. \nThe Grand Jury recommends that these documents be completed by December 31, 2011. \nThe Jail Nursing Program would also benefit from more active oversight by the Assistant \nDirector of Health and Human Services to see that it is accomplished by the above date. \nFinding \nDuring this investigation the Grand Jury finds the Jail Nursing Program is completely out \nof compliance with annual nurse training updates and standard nursing procedures. This \nexposes Sutter County to numerous potential issues in the future. \nRecommendation \nThe Grand Jury recommends that the Assistant Director of Health and Human Services \nactively take measures to ensure that this program is in full compliance with the law. It is \nunacceptable that the program is out of compliance, lack of training for the nursing staff, \nnot having the P & P's up-to-date, and the pencil corrections in the SNP. The Grand Jury \nrecommends that the Jail Nursing Program be in full compliance by December 31, 2011. \nRespondents \nDirector of Health and Human Services, Tom Sherry \nAssistant Director of Health and Human Services, Amerjit Bhattal \nCounty Medical Officer, Dr. Cummings \nJail Nurse Program Manager, Brent Garbett \n11 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 66 of 82\nAttachment A \n12 \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 97   Filed 03/28/14   Page 67 of 82\n-\n- ..... \n\\  '_.

S-11-0536 MCE GGH\n12\nvs.\n13\nCOUNTY OF SUTTER, et al.,\n14\nDefendants.  ORDER\n15                                                                 /\n16 Previously pending on this court’s law and motion calendar for January 5, 2012\n17 was defendant County of Sutter’s motion for protective order and for temporary stay of\n18 discovery, filed December 12, 2011.  Aaron Fischer and Ernest Galvan appeared for plaintiffs. \n19 John Whitefleet represented defendant.  Having heard oral argument and reviewed the joint\n20 statement, the court now issues the following order.\n21 BACKGROUND\n22 Plaintiffs are heirs of Rodney Bock, who committed suicide in the Sutter County\n23 Jail on April 29, 2010, after suffering from mental illness.  This action was initiated on February\n24 24, 2011, and the first amended complaint was filed May 25, 2011.  Alleged are claims for\n25 deliberate indifference to Bock’s mental health needs under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Monell type\n26 liability against Sutter and Yuba Counties, violation of substantive due process, violations of\n1\n\n1 Title II of the ADA and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and their state law counterparts,\n2 medical malpractice, negligence, negligent supervision, training, hiring and retention, wrongful\n3 death and failure to furnish/summon medical care, under state law.  Pending before Judge\n4 England is a motion to dismiss filed by all defendants.  \n5 Defendant filed the instant motion, contending that plaintiffs should not get\n6 discovery because the parties have not yet met and conferred, and because defendants have a\n7 potentially dispositive motion to dismiss that is under submission with Judge England.\n8 DISCUSSION\n9 I.  Whether Discovery is Permitted in Light of Rule 26(f)\n10 Defendant contends that because the parties have not completed their Rule 26(f)\n11 conference, discovery may not yet be sought pursuant to Rule 26(d)(1).  Defendant argues that\n12 the joint status report contemplates postponing initial disclosures which is all that is remaining to\n13 complete the meet and confer requirement, while plaintiffs assert that the parties have met and\n14 conferred pursuant to Rule 26(f), as evidenced by their joint status report which memorializes the\n15 meet and confer process.   \n16 Although initial disclosures generally precede discovery, it is not required that\n17 they do so.  Plaintiffs’ argument that they need discovery as to identities of Doe Defendants has\n18 merit at this stage of the proceedings where the pleadings are not yet settled.  Defendant’s\n19 argument that its motion to dismiss may obviate the need for any or all discovery requires a peek\n20 at the motion itself.  Therefore, defendant’s alternative ground for relief, that discovery should be\n21 temporarily stayed, will be analyzed.\n22 II.  Whether Discovery Should be Stayed\n23 A.  Standards For Granting A Stay Of Discovery\n24 This court has great discretion to issue protective orders denying discovery. \n25 B.R.S. Land Investors v. United States, 596 F.2d 353, 356 (9th Cir. 1979).  Nonetheless, the\n26 Federal Rules provide that good cause is required in order for a party to obtain a protective order. \n2\n\n1 Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c); Kiblen v. Retail Credit Co., 76 F.R.D. 402, 404 (E.D. Wash. 1977).  To\n2 prevail on a motion for a protective order, the party seeking the protection has the burden to\n3 demonstrate “particular and specific demonstration[s] of fact, as distinguished from conclusory\n4 statements . . . .”  Id.; Twin City Fire Ins. Co. v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, 124 F.R.D. 652, 653\n5 (D.Nev. 1989); Kamp Implement Co. v. J.I. Case Co., 630 F. Supp. 218, 219 (D. Mont. 1986).\n6 This court generally applies a two pronged analysis in deciding whether to grant a\n7 protective order staying discovery before other pending motions can be heard.  First, a pending\n8 motion must be potentially dispositive of the entire case, or at least dispositive on the issue at\n9 which discovery is directed.  Panola Land Buyer’s Ass’n v. Shuman, 762 F.2d 1550, 1560 (11th\n10 Cir. 1985).  Magistrate judges have been given broad discretion to stay discovery pending\n11 decisions on dispositive motions, including motions for summary judgment.  Id.; see also,\n12 Scroggins v. Air Cargo, Inc., 534 F.2d 1124, 1133 (5th Cir. 1976).  The court may, for example,\n13 stay discovery when it is convinced that plaintiff will be unable to state a claim for relief or if the\n14 action is moot.  B.R.S. Land Investors, 596 F.2d at 356; Wood v. McEwen, 644 F.2d 797, 801\n15 (9th Cir. 1981).\n16   Second, the court must determine whether the pending dispositive motion can be\n17 decided absent additional discovery.  See, e.g., Church of Scientology of San Francisco v.\n18 Internal Revenue Service, 991 F.2d 560, 563 (9th Cir. 1993), vacated in part on other grounds, 30\n19 F.3d 101 (9th Cir. 1994).  If the court answers these two questions in the affirmative, a protective\n20 order may issue.  However, if either prong of this test is negative, discovery proceeds.  Denying a\n21 protective order is particularly appropriate if a stay of discovery could preclude either party from\n22 fully preparing for the pending dispositive motion.  Id.\n23 B.  Analysis\n24 The requested discovery is not needed to combat the motion to dismiss, which is\n25 already briefed and under submission.  Plaintiffs believe that the first prong of the discovery stay\n26 test will not be met, i.e., defendants will not ultimately be successful on their motion to dismiss;\n3\n\n1 therefore, the motion is not dispositive of the proceedings.1\n2 The remainder of the court’s discussion will thus focus on the merits of\n3 defendants’ motion to dismiss as the reason for a discovery stay.  It must be emphasized that the\n4 undersigned does not sit as the adjudicator on the merits of defendants’ dispositive motion.  No\n5 pronouncement of this court concerning the merits of the dispositive motion binds the district\n6 judge in any way.  However, the undersigned must take a “peek” at the merits in order to assess\n7 the validity of the stay of discovery motion.  Obviously, if the motion (in the undersigned’s\n8 opinion) is completely devoid of merit, the motion will not stand to bar discovery at this time. \n9 On the other hand, if the motion will surely be granted, this court would exercise its discretion to\n10 block discovery in order to alleviate wasted resources and time.  Neither of the above extreme\n11 endpoints on the dispositive spectrum is apparent with respect to the issues in defendants’ \n12 motion.  \n13 Here, defendants’ motion appears colorable, but it can not be said that the motion\n14 will surely be granted, especially with respect to the case as a whole.  As a result, discovery\n15 should not be stayed for any lengthy period.  Nevertheless, it is quite possible that some claims\n16 and/or defendants might be eliminated by the motion, and the undersigned is reluctant to require\n17 defendants to expend resources and perform much work in responding to discovery that might be\n18 mooted by the granting of the motion in whole or in part.2  Therefore, discovery will be permitted\n19 at present, but only insofar as it seeks the identity of potential Doe Defendants.  All remaining\n20 discovery will be stayed for thirty days.  In thirty days from the filed date of this order, all other\n21 discovery may commence, if the district judge has not ruled on the pending motion to dismiss.  If \n22 \\\\\\\\\\\n23\n24 1  Plaintiffs additionally point out that the decedent’s parents are elderly and this case\nshould therefore proceed without delay.  As stated earlier, they also seek discovery of Doe\n25 Defendants, possibly for amendment of the complaint.\n26 2  It is very likely that defendants’ dispositive motion will be decided soon.\n4\n\n1 the district judge has ruled, further discovery will, of course, be determined by the nature of the\n2 ruling.  \n3 ONCLUSION\n4 Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that: Defendant County of Sutter’s motion for\n5 protective order and for temporary stay of discovery, filed December 12, 2011, (dkt. no. 21), is\n6 granted in part and denied in part.

Rodney Bock was a loving father and son with a history of mental illness.  In spite \n4 of his psychiatric problems, Rodney had run a substantial farm, growing peaches, prunes, kiwis, \n5 walnuts, rice, and other fresh produce.  He was self-employed, and for thirty years ran a \n6 successful fruit stand business in Marysville, California.  He also operated a successful, and \n7 growing, fertilizer business in the area.  He provided substantial financial and emotional support \n8 to his family, and they remained extremely close to him throughout his life. \n9 2.  In November 2009, Rodney was the victim of an attack in which he received blows \n10 to his head and body.  Soon thereafter, Rodney Bock began to experience substantial psychiatric \n11 decompensation.  He would regularly make erratic and paranoid statements that God and Rush \n12 Limbaugh were talking to him and telling him what to do.  He experienced delusions that he was \n13 being told to kill people, including the President of the United States.  As his delusions and \n14 paranoia escalated (without any acts of violence or threatened violence towards others), his \n15 family repeatedly and desperately sought help from local authorities, including the Sutter County \n16 Sheriff’s Department and Sutter-Yuba Mental Health Services. \n17 3.  Rodney Bock’s mental health deterioration starting in November 2009 led to \n18 multiple involuntary hospitalizations for psychiatric evaluation and treatment pursuant to Cal. \n19 Welf. & Inst. Code § 5150.  During the first two psychiatric hospitalizations, in November-\n20 December 2009 and January-February 2010, doctors determined that Rodney Bock required an \n21 additional two-week period of intensive inpatient treatment in order to provide appropriate care \n22 and to stabilize his condition.  According to his treatment team, Rodney Bock’s mental health \n23 during this time remained extremely precarious, as he manifested psychotic, delusional and \n24 grandiose behaviors, believing that he was communicating with God, and that the government \n25 had planted a bug in his head and was tracking him.  Doctors and mental health clinicians \n26 repeatedly recommended that Rodney Bock be provided a safe and structured setting, intensive \n27 treatment, and even an inpatient state hospital placement. \n28\n1 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND \n  STATE LAW - NO. CIV \n[479781-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 1   Filed 02/24/11   Page 3 of 38\n \n1 4.  In late March 2010, Rodney abruptly and unexpectedly drove from California to \n2 Idaho, believing that the FBI was following him, that he was communicating with God and Rush \n3 Limbaugh, and that he was “The Avenger” acting at God’s direction. \n4 5.  Rodney Bock’s family returned him home, and promptly brought him to Sutter \n5 County’s psychiatric treatment facility for emergency evaluation and treatment in April 2010.  \n6 Defendants inexplicably and inexcusably prevented Rodney Bock from receiving the treatment \n7 he desperately needed.  Defendants discharged Rodney Bock from the treatment facility barely \n8 24 hours after his admission pursuant to Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 5150, despite clinical findings \n9 that he remained psychotic and despite applicable California state law requiring that he be \n10 provided inpatient evaluation and treatment for at least 72 hours. \n11 6.  Even worse, Defendants discharged Rodney Bock to the custody of the Sutter \n12 County Sheriff’s Department, which placed him in a cell at Sutter County Jail.  Defendants \n13 completed this transfer knowing that Sutter County Jail could not, and would not, provide \n14 anything resembling the level of evaluation, treatment and supervision that Rodney Bock \n15 required in light of his decompensated psychiatric condition. \n16 7.  For the next 27 days, Rodney Bock remained at Sutter County Jail, where he \n17 received woefully inadequate psychiatric assessment, and essentially no psychiatric treatment.  \n18 Custody and medical staff, and Rodney’s family members, directly observed his condition \n19 deteriorate substantially. \n20 8.  During this time, Defendants failed to provide the care and treatment Rodney Bock \n21 urgently needed, all in spite of readily apparent indicators of Rodney’s deterioration, suicidal \n22 thoughts, and need for psychiatric attention, a judicial finding that Rodney was incompetent to \n23 stand trial, a court order explicitly directing that Rodney be placed at Napa State Hospital for \n24 inpatient treatment, and efforts by his loved ones to get Defendants to protect and provide \n25 necessary care to him. \n26 9.  Defendants’ outrageous actions and failures led to Rodney’s further decline in \n27 mental health, his unnecessary suffering, and ultimately his wholly preventable suicide at Sutter \n28 County Jail on April 29, 2010.  On the date of Rodney’s death, Defendants’ deliberate \n2 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND \n  STATE LAW - NO. CIV \n[479781-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 1   Filed 02/24/11   Page 4 of 38\n \n1 indifference proximately caused Rodney to suffer a violent and psychotic episode, including \n2 Rodney’s repeated forceful banging of his head against the cell wall, causing substantial bleeding \n3 and hemorrhaging, and his hanging himself in his jail cell. \n4 10.  Plaintiff CYNDIE DENNY BOCK, on behalf of RODNEY LOUIS BOCK \n5 (“Rodney Bock”), as Administrator of his Estate, now bring this civil rights action against \n6 Defendants for the violations of Rodney Bock’s Fourteenth Amendment rights, federal rights \n7 under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of \n8 1973, and for violations of California state law.  Plaintiffs KIMBERLY BOCK, KELLIE BOCK, \n9 HILLARY BOCK, M.B., LAURA LYNN BOCK, and ROBERT BOCK further bring this civil \n10 rights action against Defendants for violations of their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. \n11 JURISDICTION \n12 11.  This Complaint seeks damages for the violation of the civil rights, privileges, and \n13 immunities, as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States \n14 Constitution, of RODNEY LOUIS BOCK, pursuant to Title 42 U.S.C. sections 1983 and 1988, \n15 for violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the \n16 Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and for violations of California state law.  This Complaint further \n17 seeks damages for the violation of the civil rights, privileges, and immunities, of KIMBERLY \n18 BOCK, KELLIE BOCK, HILLARY BOCK, M.B., LAURA LYNN BOCK, and ROBERT \n19 BOCK as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, \n20 and under California state law. \n21 12.  This Court has jurisdiction over this lawsuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n22 1343. \n23 13.  This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims asserted herein \n24 pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, since the claims form part of the same case or controversy arising \n25 under the United States Constitution and federal law. \n26\n27\n28\n3 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND \n  STATE LAW - NO. CIV \n[479781-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 1   Filed 02/24/11   Page 5 of 38\n \n1 VENUE \n2 14.  Plaintiffs’ claims, alleged herein, arose in the Counties of Sutter and Yuba, \n3 California.  Therefore, venue lies in the Eastern District of California pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n4 § 1391(b)(2). \n5 PARTIES \n6 15.  Plaintiffs’ decedent is RODNEY LOUIS BOCK, who, at the time of his death, was \n7 a fifty-six (56) year old citizen of the United States.  He was a citizen and resident of County of \n8 Yuba in the State of California. \n9 16.  Plaintiff CYNDIE DENNY BOCK, as Administrator of the Estate of RODNEY \n10 LOUIS BOCK, brings this action pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 377.10 et \n11 seq.  The survival causes of action in this matter are based on violations of Rodney Bock’s rights \n12 under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and \n13 Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and California state law. \n14 17.  Plaintiffs KIMBERLY BOCK, KELLIE BOCK, HILLARY BOCK, M.B., \n15 LAURA LYNN BOCK, and ROBERT BOCK are suing individually for violations of their civil \n16 rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  M.B., a minor, is suing through her mother \n17 and Guardian Ad Litem, CYNDIE DENNY BOCK. \n18 18.  Plaintiffs CYNDIE DENNY BOCK and M.B. are residents of the County of Sutter, \n19 California. \n20 19.  Plaintiffs KIMBERLY BOCK, KELLIE BOCK, and HILLARY BOCK are \n21 residents of the County of Yuba, California. \n22 20.  Plaintiffs LAURA LYNN BOCK and ROBERT BOCK are residents of the County \n23 of Butte, California. \n24 21.  Defendant COUNTY OF SUTTER is a public entity, duly organized and existing \n25 under the laws of the State of California.  Under its authority, Defendant COUNTY OF SUTTER \n26 operates and manages Sutter County Jail and Sutter-Yuba Mental Health Services (SYMHS) \n27 facilities, and is, and was at all relevant times mentioned herein, responsible for the actions \n28 and/or inactions and the policies, procedures and practices/customs of the Sutter County Sheriff’s \n4 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND \n  STATE LAW - NO. CIV \n[479781-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 1   Filed 02/24/11   Page 6 of 38\n \n1 Department and SYMHS, and each entity’s respective employees and/or agents.

Welf. & Inst. Code §§ 5150, et seq.  SYMHS also provides medical and/or mental \n12 health care services to Sutter County Jail inmates. \n13 22.  Defendant COUNTY OF YUBA is a public entity, duly organized and existing \n14 under the laws of the State of California.  Under its authority, Defendant COUNTY OF YUBA \n15 operates and manages SYMHS facilities, and is, and was at all relevant times mentioned herein, \n16 responsible for the actions and/or inactions and the policies, procedures and practices/customs of \n17 SYMHS, and its respective employees and/or agents.

Rodney Bock was born on August 22, 1953, in Sacramento, California, and was \n21 raised primarily in Sacramento. \n22 43.  Rodney Bock was married to CYNDIE DENNY BOCK for 24 years before they \n23 divorced in 2004.  They had four daughters together, all of whom had close relationships with \n24 their father.  Rodney Bock also was extremely close with his parents and other family members. \n25 44.  Prior to his death, Rodney Bock lived on his farm in Marysville.  Two of his \n26 daughters, KELLIE BOCK and HILLARY BOCK, lived with him year-round, and KIMBERLY \n27 BOCK lived with him during extended periods each year consistent with her work obligations.  \n28 Rodney’s youngest daughter, M.B., stayed with him several times a month. \n10 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND \n  STATE LAW - NO. CIV \n[479781-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 1   Filed 02/24/11   Page 12 of 38\n \n1 45.  Rodney Bock worked as a self-employed farmer.  He, along with his daughters and \n2 employees, worked on the farm, producing peaches, prunes, kiwis, walnuts, and rice.  Rodney \n3 owned and operated a successful fruit vending business along Highway 70 in Marysville, \n4 California.  Rodney also sold fruit and other products grown on the farm to vendors.  \n5 Additionally, Rodney owned and operated a promising fertilizer business, with a growing \n6 number of clients in the area. \n7 46.  Rodney Bock had a history of mental illness, but had managed to maintain a \n8 positive family life and to operate his business ventures successfully for thirty years. \n9\nNovember-December 2009 Mental Health Problems and Inpatient Treatment  \n10\n47.  In or about November 2009, Rodney Bock was the victim of an attack after an \n11\nargument with a local resident.  Rodney suffered several blows to his head and body.  Soon \n12\nthereafter, he began making erratic and paranoid statements.  In one incident, a game warden \n13\nobserved Rodney Bock in an isolated nature area stating that God was talking to him and telling \n14\nhim to kill people.  The game warden did not arrest Rodney Bock, but told Rodney’s family that \n15\nRodney needed mental help. \n16\n48.  On or about November 26, 2009, Rodney Bock’s brother, James Bock, and/or other \n17\nfamily members, contacted the Sutter County Sheriff’s Department with concerns about \n18\nRodney’s mental health, including his statements that God was telling him what to do and that \n19\nGod wanted him to kill people, including the President of the United States.  The Sutter County \n20\nSheriff’s Department held Rodney for several hours, but released him later that day. \n21\n49.  Rodney Bock exhibited delusional and extremely paranoid behavior at the time of \n22\nhis release on November 26, 2009.  He immediately began wandering the streets, and his \n23\ndaughter, KELLIE BOCK, found him hiding behind a tree.  There, he told her that he was being \n24\nfollowed and that people were after him.  After KELLIE BOCK brought him home, he became \n25\nagitated: he began yelling, punching and/or kicking holes in a door and the house’s walls. \n26\n50.  Later that night, Rodney Bock abruptly left his house and went to a local duck \n27\nclub, where he was a member.  The next day, family members found Rodney Bock behaving \n28\n11 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND \n  STATE LAW - NO. CIV \n[479781-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 1   Filed 02/24/11   Page 13 of 38\n \n1 extremely erratically at the duck club.  He had broken the windows of the duck club with a \n2 propane tank, and was acting out based upon apparent delusions and paranoia.  He refused to \n3 return home or to eat.  He spent the night in a ditch, demanding that family members leave him \n4 alone and stating that he wanted to be with God. \n5 51.  On or about November 27, 2009, family members attempted to have an \n6 “intervention” with Rodney Bock, which included a family friend who was a mental health \n7 professional.  Rodney told them that he was listening to God.  Family members contacted county \n8 officials, and Rodney Bock was admitted to Psychiatric Emergency Services (PES) at SYMHS \n9 for psychiatric evaluation.  Following an evaluation, Defendant ZIL and/or other SYMHS staff \n10 determined that Rodney Bock did not meet the criteria for involuntary hospitalization pursuant to \n11 Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 5150. \n12 52.  On or about November 30, 2009, family members again contacted the Sutter \n13 County Sheriff’s Department based on Rodney Bock’s continued paranoia, delusions, and \n14 psychotic behavior.  Rodney was taken to the SYMHS Psychiatric Health Facility, where he was \n15 admitted on a 72-hour hold for evaluation and treatment pursuant to Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code \n16 § 5150.  Rodney was admitted based on a finding that he was a danger to others, or to himself, or \n17 was a gravely disabled adult. \n18 53.  SYMHS has sixteen (16) inpatient beds for mentally ill patients, with an average \n19 census of approximately nine (9) to eleven (11) patients.  SYMHS clinical, administrative, and \n20 supervisory staff members have, or reasonably should have, knowledge of all patients held at \n21 SYMHS, and their respective psychiatric conditions, at any given time. \n22 54.  Following a psychiatric exam, Rodney Bock was documented as presenting as \n23 psychotic, delusional, and grandiose.  Defendants documented that Rodney Bock had a history of \n24 head trauma and a family history that included at least one completed suicide, that his thought \n25 process was “quite scattered and tangential,” and that his insight and judgment were markedly \n26 impaired.  Rodney Bock expressed to SYMHS staff his belief that President Obama was \n27 “sending people to kill him.”  \n28\n12 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND \n  STATE LAW - NO. CIV \n[479781-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 1   Filed 02/24/11   Page 14 of 38\n \n1 55.  Following the 72-hour hold, Rodney Bock was certified pursuant to Cal. Welf. & \n2 Inst. Code § 5250 to remain at SYMHS for an additional 14 days of involuntary hospitalization, \n3 based on a finding that he was a danger to others, or to himself, or was gravely disabled, as a \n4 result of a mental disorder or impairment requiring continued intensive psychiatric treatment. \n5 56.  During his inpatient treatment at SYMHS, Defendant BARNETT and other \n6 SYMHS staff evaluated and treated Rodney Bock, identifying serious psychiatric diagnoses, \n7 including:  Bipolar I Disorder, Most Recent Episode Manic, Severe with Psychotic Features; \n8 Alcohol Dependence; and Cannabis Dependence.  An SYMHS Inpatient Services \n9 Interdisciplinary Treatment Team documented staff members’ recommendation that Rodney \n10 Bock be provided a “supportive therapeutic milieu” to treat his psychiatric condition. \n11 57.  Defendants did not provide a CT scan, MRI, or any other diagnostic assessment or \n12 treatment related to the reported head trauma suffered by Rodney Bock. \n13 58.  At the time of his discharge on or about December 17, 2009, after approximately \n14 two and one half weeks of intensive treatment, Rodney Bock’s psychiatric condition and level of \n15 functioning remained extremely precarious.  According to the SYMHS discharge summary, \n16 signed by Defendant BARNETT, Defendant BARNETT was to continue to provide psychiatric \n17 treatment to Rodney Bock. \n18\nJanuary-February 2010 Mental Health Problems and Inpatient Treatment \n19\n59.  On or about January 14, 2010, Rodney Bock again became delusional and \n20\nparanoid, this time acting out at a local Applebee’s restaurant.  He carried a gun into the \n21\nrestaurant, where he asked for something to eat and then made several erratic statements.  He was \n22\narrested by police and taken by Sutter County Sheriff’s Department to Sutter County Jail.  \n23\nCriminal charges were filed against Rodney based on this incident. \n24\n60.  On or about January 15, 2010, Rodney Bock was held at Sutter County Jail while \n25\ncontinuing to manifest his unstable mental health condition.  Custody staff completed Rodney \n26\nBock’s Inmate Medical Screening Form.  Defendants failed to properly assess or document \n27\n28\n13 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND \n  STATE LAW - NO. CIV \n[479781-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 1   Filed 02/24/11   Page 15 of 38\n \n1 Rodney Bock’s medication needs and his risk for violence and/or suicide on the Inmate Medical \n2 Screening Form. \n3 61.  On or about January 15, 2010, without appropriate supervision and protection by \n4 Defendants as warranted in light of Rodney Bock’s deteriorated psychiatric condition, Rodney \n5 Bock was attacked, punched, and physically beaten by another inmate at Sutter County Jail, \n6 causing serious injuries to his face and body. \n7 62.  On or about January 15, 2010, Rodney Bock was referred to SYMHS for a \n8 psychiatric evaluation. SYMHS staff completed a “Jail Outreach” evaluation, documenting \n9 Rodney Bock’s psychiatric history, including his delusions that he was being directed by God. \n10 63.  Rodney Bock was subsequently released from custody on bail. \n11 64.  On or about January 25, 2010, Rodney Bock’s close friends and family became \n12 alarmed by his delusional and paranoid behaviors.  They observed him making irrational \n13 statements, including that people were going to “get him.”  Rodney Bock’s family again sought \n14 psychiatric treatment for Rodney.  Sutter County Sheriff’s Department brought Rodney Bock to \n15 the SYMHS Psychiatric Health Facility, where he was admitted on a 72-hour hold for evaluation \n16 and treatment pursuant to Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 5150 based on a finding that he was a danger \n17 to others, or to himself, or was a gravely disabled adult. \n18 65.  Following his 72-hour hold, Rodney Bock was certified pursuant to Cal. Welf. & \n19 Inst. Code § 5250 to remain at SYMHS Psychiatric Health Facility for an additional 14 days of \n20 involuntary hospitalization, based on a finding that he was a danger to others, or to himself, or \n21 was gravely disabled, as a result of a mental disorder or impairment requiring continued \n22 intensive psychiatric treatment. \n23 66.  During his inpatient treatment at SYMHS Psychiatric Health Facility, Defendants \n24 BARNETT and MEER, and other SYMHS staff, evaluated and treated Rodney Bock. \n25 67.  Defendant BARNETT and other SYMHS staff confirmed and documented Rodney \n26 Bock’s serious psychiatric diagnoses, including:  Bipolar I Disorder, Most Recent Episode \n27 Manic, Severe with Psychotic Features; Alcohol Dependence; and Cannabis Dependence.  An \n28 SYMHS Inpatient Services Interdisciplinary Treatment Team documented its recommendation \n14 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND \n  STATE LAW - NO. CIV \n[479781-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 1   Filed 02/24/11   Page 16 of 38\n \n1 that Rodney Bock be provided a “safe, secure milieu and appropriate level of observation” to \n2 treat his psychiatric condition, including his potential to harm others and his ongoing delusions.  \n3 Defendant BARNETT and other SYMHS staff found him to be “delusional, grandiose, \n4 hyperreligious (being ‘led by God’),” “quite psychotic/manic,” and demonstrating “markedly \n5 impaired” insight and judgment.  Defendants documented that Rodney Bock was to receive \n6 fifteen-minute safety checks and daily treatment. \n7 68.  Defendant BARNETT documented that Rodney Bock may have “need[ed] CT \n8 Scan of head [prior to discharge] (will rec[ommend] that) considering [history] of head injuries.”  \n9 Defendants never ordered or provided this essential diagnostic testing for Rodney Bock. \n10 69.  On or about February 12, 2010, Rodney Bock was discharged from SYMHS \n11 Psychiatric Health Facility.  Although his functioning had somewhat improved during the \n12 approximately two and a half weeks of treatment, he continued to suffer from serious psychiatric \n13 problems, including delusions and impaired insight and judgment, all of which jeopardized his \n14 well being and safety.  Defendant BARNETT found that Rodney Bock “still remain[ed] \n15 somewhat delusional concerning being driven by God.”   \n16 70.  Defendants BARNETT and MEER, and other SYMHS staff, were to continue to \n17 provide treatment to Rodney Bock following discharge, including scheduled psychiatric \n18 appointments. \n19 Court-Ordered Evaluations to Determine Rodney Bock’s Competency \n20 71.  In light of Rodney Bock’s serious and ongoing psychiatric problems, the court \n21 presiding over the pending criminal complaint against Rodney expressed concern about \n22 Rodney’s mental competency to stand trial.  On or about January 27, 2010, the Honorable H. Ted \n23 Hanson of Sutter County Superior Court ordered that Rodney Bock undergo a psychological \n24 evaluation to assist in a determination of whether he was competent to stand trial. \n25 72.  On February 22, 2010, Dr. Deborah Schmidt, Ph.D. conducted the court-ordered \n26 psychological evaluation of Rodney Bock.  Dr. Schmidt’s findings make clear that Rodney Bock \n27 suffered serious psychiatric impairments, including an active delusional, paranoid, and psychotic \n28 state, emotional instability, and high levels of agitation and excitability.  Dr. Schmidt concluded \n15 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND \n  STATE LAW - NO. CIV \n[479781-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 1   Filed 02/24/11   Page 17 of 38\n \n1 that Rodney Bock’s highly unstable psychiatric condition made him incompetent to stand trial.  \n2 Dr. Schmidt concluded that Rodney Bock required further psychiatric assessment and more \n3 intensive treatment. \n4 73.  On or about March 1, 2010, the Hon. Brian R. Aronson of Sutter County Superior \n5 Court ordered a placement evaluation of Rodney Bock pursuant to California Penal Code § 1370. \n6 74.  Dr. Rick Bingham, the Community Program Director for the Sutter-Yuba \n7 Conditional Release Program, completed the court-ordered placement evaluation.  On or about \n8 March 22, 2010, Dr. Bingham documented Rodney Bock’s history of experiencing manic \n9 episodes of Bipolar Disorder, his delusions of a special relationship with Rush Limbaugh and of \n10 receiving messages from God directing his actions, and his history of alcohol and cannabis \n11 dependence.  Dr. Bingham recommended that Rodney Bock be placed on outpatient status.  Dr. \n12 Bingham scheduled an appointment with Rodney Bock for March 30, 2010. \n13 75.  On or about March 25, 2010, Rodney Bock attended his scheduled psychiatric \n14 appointment with Defendant MEER.  Defendant MEER documented Rodney Bock’s delusions \n15 regarding speaking with God and doing “what God wants him to do.”  Defendant MEER \n16 documented a plan to follow up with Rodney Bock. \n17 March-April 2010 Mental Health Crisis and Inpatient Treatment  \n18 76.  Around the time of Dr. Bingham’s report, Rodney Bock began to experience \n19 paranoia and delusions.  Based on delusional beliefs that God was directing him and that he \n20 needed to meet with Rush Limbaugh, Rodney Bock abruptly drove to his nephew’s home in \n21 Idaho.  He expressed beliefs that the FBI was following him, that he was openly and actively \n22 communicating with God and Rush Limbaugh, that he was going to travel somewhere with Rush \n23 Limbaugh by helicopter, and that he was “The Avenger” and would kill someone if God directed \n24 to do so. \n25 77.  Because of his psychiatric deterioration and the resultant trip to Idaho, Rodney \n26 Bock missed a March 29, 2010 court date.  A warrant was issued based on this missed court date. \n27 78.  On or about March 29, 2010, Dr. Bingham sent another letter to the court, stating \n28 that he “wishe[d] to retract his recommendations” with respect to the appropriateness of \n16 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND \n  STATE LAW - NO. CIV \n[479781-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 1   Filed 02/24/11   Page 18 of 38\n \n1 outpatient treatment for Rodney Bock, as contained in the March 22, 2010 placement evaluation \n2 report. \n3 79.  Recognizing his uncle’s severe decompensation and highly unstable psychiatric \n4 state, Rodney Bock’s nephew brought Rodney Bock back from Idaho to California on or about \n5 April 1, 2010.  Rodney Bock’s family returned Rodney to SYMHS Psychiatric Health Facility, \n6 where he was admitted for a 72-hour period of treatment and evaluation pursuant to Cal. Welf. & \n7 Inst. Code § 5150.   \n8 Premature and Improper Discharge from Involuntary Hospitalization \n9 80.  Upon his admission to SYMHS Psychiatric Health Facility on April 1, 2010, \n10 psychiatric staff identified Rodney Bock’s highly unstable psychiatric condition as well as his \n11 need for a safe and structured therapeutic setting, including but not limited to inpatient \n12 hospitalization. \n13 81.  By this time, based on his recent psychotic episodes and repeated admissions and \n14 hospitalizations at SYMHS, Rodney Bock’s mental health problems were widely known by \n15 SYMHS clinical, administrative, and supervisory staff. \n16 82.  On or about April 1, 2010, an SYMHS Inpatient Services Interdisciplinary \n17 Treatment Team confirmed Rodney Bock’s diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder, Manic with Severe \n18 Psychotic Features, and recommended necessary interventions that included provision of a “safe \n19 and structured milieu,” “redirection as required [and] oberserv[ation] for safety,” and “[group] \n20 participation” in activities.  The Interdisciplinary Treatment Team further documented Rodney \n21 Bock’s need for a “state hospital placement.” \n22 83.  Yet, on April 2, 2010, barely 24 hours after his admission at SYMHS Psychiatric \n23 Health Facility for a 72-hour period of treatment and evaluation pursuant to Cal. Welf. & Inst. \n24 Code § 5150, Defendants discharged Rodney Bock, transferred him to the custody of the Sutter \n25 County Sheriff’s Department, and placed him at Sutter County Jail. \n26 84.  Defendants completed this premature and improper transfer of custody with \n27 knowledge of Rodney Bock’s clear and urgent need for a safe, structured, and intensive inpatient \n28 treatment setting. \n17 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND \n  STATE LAW - NO. CIV \n[479781-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 1   Filed 02/24/11   Page 19 of 38\n \n1 85.  Defendants’ transfer of Rodney Bock from SYMHS Psychiatric Health Facility to \n2 the Sutter County Sheriff’s Department violated the statutory requirement, as provided in Cal. \n3 Welf. & Inst. Code § 5152(a), that Rodney Bock “receive whatever treatment and care his … \n4 condition requires for the full period that he … is held” pursuant to § 5150, and that he “be \n5 released before 72 hours have elapsed only if the psychiatrist directly responsible for the \n6 person’s treatment believes, as a result of the psychiatrist’s personal observations, that [he] no \n7 longer requires evaluation or treatment” (emphasis added).  Defendants completed Rodney \n8 Bock’s premature transfer to Sutter County Jail without any finding that he no longer required \n9 evaluation or treatment.  To the contrary, Rodney Bock clearly required structured inpatient \n10 psychiatric treatment.  As discussed below, Defendants failed to provide such evaluation and \n11 treatment at Sutter County Jail in the weeks leading up to Rodney Bock’s suicide. \n12 86.  At the time of Rodney Bock’s discharge on April 2, 2010, Defendant BARNETT \n13 and other SYMHS staff provided a wholly inadequate treatment plan, stating that the plan was \n14 for “law enforcement to come and serve the warrant and arrest [him] and take him to jail for \n15 further Tx [treatment] there,” including “further psychiatric treatment with the jail psychiatrist.”  \n16 Defendant BARNETT documented that Rodney Bock was “telling everyone on the unit about his \n17 delusions of the ‘end times’” prior to his discharge.  Defendant BARNETT documented that \n18 Rodney Bock “remained quite manic and psychotic,” “was quite grandiose and delusional with \n19 flight of ideas and quite focused on hyper-religious content,” and demonstrated “markedly \n20 impaired” insight and judgment.  Defendants provided a discharge plan that included no more \n21 than that SYMHS staff would “[f]ollow-up with the Sutter County Jail psychiatric services.” \n22 87.  SYMHS is responsible for the provision of mental health evaluation, treatment, and \n23 related services to prisoners at Sutter County Jail.  Defendants SHERRY, BHATTAL, and LUZ, \n24 as well as SYMHS clinical staff, were aware of their legal duties to ensure the provision of \n25 constitutionally adequate mental health care to Sutter County Jail prisoners suffering from mental \n26 illness. \n27 88.  Defendants PARKER, SHERRY, BHATTAL, and LUZ, as well as SYMHS and \n28 Sutter County Jail staff responsible for providing care and ensuring the safety of Sutter County \n18 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND \n  STATE LAW - NO. CIV \n[479781-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 1   Filed 02/24/11   Page 20 of 38\n \n1 Jail prisoners, were on notice of constitutional requirements for the provision of mental health \n2 care to prisoners by virtue of the well publicized decision in Coleman v. Wilson, 912 F. Supp. \n3 1282 (E.D. Cal. 1995), and subsequent orders in the Coleman litigation, which describe in detail \n4 the essential components of constitutionally adequate mental health care in California state \n5 prisons, including appropriate staffing, provision of services, supervision, and suicide prevention \n6 procedures.  Defendants, knowing that such constitutional obligations also apply with respect to \n7 the treatment of county jail prisoners, failed to take steps to provide constitutionally mandated \n8 mental health care and to prevent the foreseeable harm suffered by Rodney Bock. \n9 89.  In blatant disregard for Rodney Bock’s continued need for intensive inpatient \n10 psychiatric treatment, Defendants failed to create or implement anything resembling an adequate \n11 plan for providing the psychiatric treatment Rodney Bock desperately needed.  Defendants knew \n12 that Sutter County Jail could not, and would not, provide the necessary and appropriate \n13 placement and treatment that Rodney Bock required, and failed to take steps to prevent the \n14 constitutional violations and foreseeable harm suffered by Rodney Bock. \n15 Deliberately Indifferent Treatment and Failure to Admit at DMH \n16 90.  From April 2, 2010 until April 29, 2010, Defendants held Rodney Bock at Sutter \n17 County Jail as a pretrial detained prisoner.  During this time period, Defendants failed to provide \n18 adequate evaluation, supervision, and treatment, even as Rodney Bock’s mental health condition \n19 deteriorated dramatically and a court ordered that Rodney Bock be placed at a state hospital for \n20 inpatient treatment. \n21 91.  Sutter County’s main jail, where Rodney Bock was held in custody, has a prisoner \n22 capacity of approximately 200 prisoners.  Sutter County Jail staff and supervisors, including \n23 Defendant Sheriff PARKER have, or reasonably should have, knowledge of all prisoners in \n24 Sutter County Jail, and especially those prisoners manifesting psychotic behaviors, at any given \n25 time. \n26 92.  Written reports of all incidents, either major or minor, relating to prisoners and the \n27 operations of Sutter County Jail, must be delivered to jail administrative staff, including \n28\n19 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND \n  STATE LAW - NO. CIV \n[479781-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 1   Filed 02/24/11   Page 21 of 38\n \n1 Defendant PARKER as Sheriff.  Pursuant to Sutter County Jail policy, Defendant PARKER is to \n2 receive notice of all such incidents through the chain of command. \n3 93.  Upon Rodney’s arrival at Sutter County Jail, Custody staff completed Rodney \n4 Bock’s Inmate Medical Screening Form.  Defendants failed to properly assess or document \n5 Rodney Bock’s medication needs and his risk for suicide on the Inmate Medical Screening Form. \n6 94.  On April 2, 2010, Defendant ZIL, who was to provide essential mental health \n7 treatment to Rodney Bock at Sutter County Jail, communicated to a jail nurse, over the phone \n8 and without any in-person assessment, that Rodney Bock was to continue his current medication \n9 regimen. \n10 95.  On or about April 4, 2010, SYMHS and/or Sutter County Sheriff’s Department \n11 staff documented Rodney Bock’s continued delusions and the need for a psychiatric doctor to \n12 complete “further review.” \n13 96.  Defendant ZIL provided a single in-person psychiatric meeting with Rodney Bock, \n14 on or about April 8, 2010, a full six days after Rodney Bock was transferred to Sutter County \n15 Jail.  Defendant ZIL failed to provide or ensure adequate assessment and treatment for Rodney \n16 Bock.  Despite readily apparent psychiatric decompensation, no other in-person assessment or \n17 treatment was provided to Rodney Bock by appropriate mental health specialists between the \n18 time of his transfer to Sutter County Jail on April 2, 2010, and his suicide on April 29, 2010. \n19 97.  On or about April 12, 2010, Judge Aronson requested that Dr. Bingham provide a \n20 revised placement recommendation for Rodney Bock.  On or about April 13, 2010, Dr. Bingham \n21 recommended that Rodney Bock be placed at Napa State Hospital for inpatient treatment. \n22 98.  On or about April 19, 2010, Judge Aronson held a hearing regarding Rodney \n23 Bock’s competency.  Judge Aronson found that Rodney Bock was incompetent to stand trial, \n24 ordered that criminal proceedings against Rodney Bock remain suspended, and ordered that \n25 Rodney Bock be transferred to the custody of Napa State Hospital, which is operated by DMH. \n26 99.  Defendant PARKER, in his role as Sutter County Sheriff, has the statutory duty to \n27 be informed of any Sutter County Jail inmate that has been found mentally incompetent and has \n28 been ordered transferred to a state hospital.  Pursuant to Calif. Penal Code § 1370, it is the \n20 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND \n  STATE LAW - NO. CIV \n[479781-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 1   Filed 02/24/11   Page 22 of 38\n \n1 sheriff’s duty to be informed about any order on a prisoner’s lack of mental competency and state \n2 hospital placement, and to complete the delivery of that prisoner to the state hospital. \n3 100.  Defendants failed to complete this court-ordered transfer of Rodney Bock to Napa \n4 State Hospital.  Defendants DMH, ALLENBY, and MATTEUCCI, failed to admit Rodney Bock \n5 as a patient at Napa State Hospital on a timely basis, failed to provide him appropriate treatment, \n6 failed to protect him from harm, and failed to ensure that he was timely placed in an appropriate \n7 treatment facility. \n8 101.  Defendant DMH has a practice of unreasonably delaying timely transfer of \n9 mentally ill patients placed at DMH facilities, including Napa State Hospital, pursuant to Calif. \n10 Penal Code § 1370, and/or unreasonably delaying timely admission of such mentally ill patients \n11 to DMH facilities, including Napa State Hospital. \n12 102.  Mentally ill individuals found incompetent to stand trial and ordered placed in a \n13 state hospital operated by DMH have customarily been made to linger for several months in \n14 inappropriate and dangerous jail settings, based on an inadequate supply of inpatient beds, long \n15 waitlists, and other state failures. \n16 103.  Defendants instead continued to hold Rodney Bock at Sutter County Jail and to \n17 deny him desperately needed psychiatric and medical treatment. \n18 104.  Defendants ignored an Inmate Request Form, dated April 7, 2011 and completed \n19 by Rodney Bock, in which Rodney stated that his housing location was “Soon to be Hell!,” a \n20 clear cry for help. \n21 105.  By April 24, 2010, Rodney Bock’s condition had deteriorated to an alarming level, \n22 with SYMHS and/or Sutter County Sheriff’s Department staff reporting that he was unstable, \n23 unkempt, talking to himself and to inanimate objects including a sheet of paper, and refusing to \n24 take medications.  Still, no clinician evaluated or provided treatment of any kind to Rodney \n25 Bock. \n26 106.  Rodney Bock’s family members, including KIMBERLY BOCK, KELLIE BOCK, \n27 HILLARY BOCK, LAURA LYNN BOCK, and ROBERT BOCK, visited him regularly at Sutter \n28 County Jail.  They observed Rodney’s substantial physical and psychiatric deterioration.  They \n21 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND \n  STATE LAW - NO. CIV \n[479781-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 1   Filed 02/24/11   Page 23 of 38\n \n1 observed that SYMHS and jail staff demonstrated little to no concern about Rodney’s worsening \n2 condition. \n3 107.  On April 26, 2010, family members visited Rodney Bock at Sutter County Jail \n4 observed him in a crisis-level condition.  His physical appearance was severely deteriorated: he \n5 was unshaven, with bags under his eyes, and was visibly exhausted.  He also demonstrated \n6 highly delusional and paranoid behaviors, making statements relating to his need to die.  \n7 Rodney’s family members were deeply distressed. \n8 108.  In spite of Rodney Bock’s continued decompensation and grave psychiatric \n9 condition, Defendants failed to evaluate Rodney Bock and, in spite of a clinically-based \n10 placement recommendation and a court order, failed to transfer Rodney to an appropriate facility \n11 for desperately needed inpatient psychiatric care. \n12 109.  Between the time of his transfer to Sutter County Jail on April 2, 2010, and his \n13 suicide on April 29, 2010, Defendants failed to complete an appropriate medication assessment \n14 for Rodney Bock, failed to provide a diagnostic assessment for Rodney Bock’s reported head \n15 trauma, and failed to ensure that Rodney Bock received his prescription medications, despite his \n16 manifest and seriously deteriorated mental state, which included active delusions and paranoid \n17 behaviors, his talking to himself and to inanimate objects, his stated refusal to take his prescribed \n18 medication, his deteriorated physical appearance, and his statements relating to his need to die. \n19 110.  During his incarceration at Sutter County Jail, Rodney Bock began refusing his \n20 medication.  Defendants failed to take appropriate steps to provide necessary assessment or \n21 treatment, or to ensure that Rodney Bock ingested his needed medication, even as his psychiatric \n22 condition visibly worsened. \n23 111.  Defendants failed to complete an appropriate suicide assessment for Rodney Bock \n24 between the time of his transfer to Sutter County Jail on April 2, 2010, and his suicide on April \n25 29, 2010, despite his seriously deteriorated mental state and expressions of suicidal thoughts. \n26 112.  Rodney Bock’s deteriorated mental state resulted from and was greatly exacerbated \n27 by Defendants’ deliberately indifferent denial of psychiatric assessment and treatment, wholly \n28 inadequate medication management, and the grossly improper placement in a non-therapeutic jail \n22 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND \n  STATE LAW - NO. CIV \n[479781-1] \n\nCase 2:11-cv-00536-MCE-KJN   Document 1   Filed 02/24/11   Page 24 of 38\n \n1 environment rather than the inpatient hospitalization recommended by clinicians and ordered by \n2 a court. \n3 113.  Between the time of his transfer to Sutter County Jail on April 2, 2010, and his \n4 suicide on April 29, 2010, Rodney Bock was placed in a cell at Sutter County Jail that was \n5 inappropriate for a person in his unstable condition and in need of inpatient psychiatric care.  \n6 Upon information and belief, the cell was located in a corner of the jail where there was an \n7 insufficient line of vision to monitor Rodney Bock’s severe and deteriorating psychiatric \n8 condition.  Officers and other staff were unable to hear sounds and noises coming from Rodney \n9 Bock’s cell given its location and the general ambient noises in the jail. \n10 114.  Defendants, as a result of their own deliberate indifference, negligence, and \n11 insufficient training and supervision, failed to follow the Sutter County Jail’s own written \n12 policies and procedures, which provided that “Inmates with suspected mental disorders, who are \n13 a potential danger to themselves or others or appear to be gravely disabled shall be promptly \n14 evaluated and, if clinically indicated, transferred to an appropriate psychiatric treatment \n15 facility.…  Regardless of the time of presentation, significantly disordered behavior should be \n16 evaluated promptly, within twenty-four hours at the latest.  The Jail Lieutenant or Jail Facility \n17 Manager will be contacted and will make every effort to transfer mentally disordered inmates to \n18 appropriate treatment facilities.  All attempts and efforts to implement the transfer of such \n19 inmates, whether successful or not shall be documented.” \n20 115.  On or about April 28, 2010, Defendant MEER failed to meet with Rodney Bock in \n21 spite of a scheduled follow-up psychiatric appointment. \n22 116.  On or about April 29, 2010, Rodney Bock again refused his medication, stating to \n23 staff members “I don’t take meds.”  Shortly thereafter, as a proximate result of his deteriorated \n24 and untreated psychiatric condition, of which Defendants were aware, Rodney Bock engaged in \n25 extensive and violent behaviors in his cell, causing massive injuries, including significant \n26 bleeding and hemorrhaging on his face, several parts of his head, and throughout his body. \n27 117.  On April 29, 2010, using items in his cell that should not have been present in the \n28 cell of a person manifesting Rodney Bock’s decompensated psychiatric condition, including \n23 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND \n  STATE LAW - NO.

Defendants failed to provide adequate supervision and checks to monitor Rodney \n4 Bock’s condition and safety.  In spite of what was clearly a violent and psychotic episode, \n5 Defendants failed to timely respond to provide emergency treatment and care.  A staff member \n6 finally discovered Rodney Bock’s body hanging from the upper bunk bed in his cell.  By that \n7 time, substantial amounts of Rodney’s blood covered the floor and walls of his cell. \n8 119.  Defendants, as a result of their own deliberate indifference, negligence and \n9 inadequate training and supervision to render psychiatric and medical treatment to severely \n10 mentally disabled patients such as Rodney Bock, failed to timely respond and provide life-saving \n11 intervention or treatment. \n12 120.  Rodney Bock died in his cell on the evening of April 29, 2010, at the age of 56. \n13 CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n14 FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nCruel and Unusual Punishment in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to \n15 the Constitution of the United States – Deliberate Indifference to Serious \nMedical Needs, Health and Safety \n16 (Survival Action – 42 U.S.C.

Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 120, as \n20 though fully set forth herein. \n21 122.  Defendants knew that there was a strong likelihood that Rodney Bock was in \n22 danger of serious personal harm, and that he would try to harm himself, because: \n23 a.  Rodney Bock had a substantial history of serious mental illness, and had \n24 been transported and treated by Defendants in light of mental health crises on multiple occasions \n25 in the approximately six months prior to his death; \n26 b.  Defendants completed and possessed psychiatric reports stemming from \n27 Rodney Bock’s intensive inpatient treatment at SYMHS, documenting Rodney Bock’s serious \n28\n24 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND \n  STATE LAW - NO.

Defendants possessed the psychiatric evaluation report of Rodney Bock, \n4 which was completed by Dr. Deborah Schmidt, Ph.D. pursuant to a court order, and which \n5 concluded that Rodney Bock was suffering serious psychiatric impairments, including an active \n6 delusional, paranoid, and psychotic state, emotional instability, and high levels of agitation and \n7 excitability, that he was incompetent to stand trial, and that he required further assessment and \n8 treatment; \n9 d.  Dr. Bingham, after rescinding a recommendation that outpatient psychiatric \n10 treatment was appropriate for Rodney Bock, recommended that Rodney Bock be placed at Napa \n11 State Hospital for inpatient treatment; \n12 e.  A court order was issued finding that Rodney Bock was incompetent to \n13 stand trial pursuant to Calif. Penal Code § 1370; \n14 f.  A court order was issued finding that criminal proceedings against Rodney \n15 Bock should remain suspended, and directing that Rodney Bock be transferred by the Sutter \n16 County Sheriff’s Department to Napa State Hospital, a DMH facility; \n17 g.  An SYMHS Inpatient Services Interdisciplinary Treatment Team found, on \n18 multiple occasions, that Rodney Bock required a “supportive therapeutic milieu,” a “safe, secure \n19 milieu and appropriate level of observation,” and/or a “state hospital placement” for inpatient \n20 psychiatric treatment; \n21 h.  Defendants knowingly discharged Rodney Bock from SYMHS on April 2, \n22 2010, prior to completion of the period for which Rodney Bock was admitted pursuant to Cal. \n23 Welf. & Inst. Code § 5150, without a psychiatrist finding, based on personal observation, that \n24 Rodney Bock no longer required evaluation or treatment; \n25 i.  Defendant BARNETT observed and documented that Rodney Bock \n26 “remained quite manic and psychotic,” with delusions and “markedly impaired” insight and \n27 judgment, at the time of his discharge from SYMHS and transfer to Sutter County Jail on April \n28 2, 2010; \n25 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND \n  STATE LAW - NO.

Defendants transferred Rodney Bock to Sutter County Jail knowing that \n2 they were discharging a severely psychotic and unstable patient to a placement where he would \n3 receive little to none of the mental health care he desperately required; \n4 k.  Defendants prepared a grossly inadequate treatment plan for Rodney Bock \n5 upon his April 2, 2010 discharge, knowing that Sutter County Jail could not, and would not, \n6 provide necessary and appropriate psychiatric placement and treatment to Rodney Bock; \n7 l.  Defendant ZIL and other SYMHS and Sutter County Jail staff provided \n8 grossly inadequate mental health assessment and treatment during the twenty-seven (27) days \n9 that Rodney Bock was held at Sutter County Jail, even as SYMHS and/or Sutter County Sheriff’s \n10 Department staff documented Rodney Bock’s substantial decompensation at Sutter County Jail; \n11 m.  Defendant MEER observed and documented Rodney Bock’s delusions and \n12 other mental health problems, but failed to keep a psychiatric appointment the day prior to \n13 Rodney Bock’s suicide, and failed to otherwise follow up with or provide essential treatment to \n14 Rodney Bock; \n15 n.  Family members and friends of Rodney Bock communicated to Defendants \n16 their serious concerns about his mental health impairments and the related effects on his behavior \n17 and threats to his personal safety and the safety of others; \n18 o.  Defendants were aware of and documented Rodney’s Bock’s history of \n19 recent head trauma, but failed to provide a CT scan, MRI, or any other diagnostic assessment or \n20 treatment related to the reported head trauma; \n21 p.  SYMHS and/or Sutter County Sheriff’s Department staff observed and \n22 documented that Rodney Bock had decompensated substantially in the days before his suicide – \n23 including his deteriorated physical appearance, psychotic behavior, and his writing on a jail \n24 Inmate Request Form that his housing location was “Soon to be hell!” – but failed to provide \n25 appropriate assessment, supervision, and treatment to prevent him from harming himself; \n26 q.  Defendants did not take steps to ensure that Rodney Bock was receiving and \n27 ingesting appropriate medications; \n28\n26 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND \n  STATE LAW - NO.

Defendants provided inadequate safety checks, supervision, and monitoring \n2 to ensure Rodney Bock’s safety and well being in his cell at Sutter County Jail; \n3 s.  Defendants placed Rodney Bock in a cell located in a corner of Sutter \n4 County Jail where there was an insufficient line of vision and/or insufficient ability to hear \n5 sounds and noises coming from the cell, such that they were unable to provide adequate \n6 supervision and monitoring of Rodney Bock’s severe and deteriorating psychiatric condition; and \n7 t.  Defendants did not remove items from Rodney Bock’s cell that could be \n8 used for him to commit suicide. \n9 123.  Defendants failed to provide necessary mental health evaluation and treatment and \n10 adequate supervision for Rodney Bock while he was placed at SYMHS and Sutter County Jail, \n11 and failed to ensure necessary continuation of care despite his obvious psychotic state, high risk \n12 of harming himself, and need for inpatient psychiatric treatment, as determined following a \n13 psychiatric evaluation and as ordered by a court. \n14 124.  Defendants’ acts and/or omissions as alleged herein, including but not limited to \n15 their failure to provide Rodney Bock with medical or psychiatric care and/or to take other \n16 measures to protect him from physical harm and to prevent his attempting suicide after notice of \n17 his psychiatric condition, along with the acts and/or omissions of the Defendants in failing to \n18 train, supervise and/or promulgate appropriate policies and procedures at Sutter County Jail in \n19 order to prevent Rodney Bock’s and other inmate suicides, constituted deliberate indifference to \n20 Rodney Bock’s serious medical needs, health and safety. \n21 125.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ conduct, Rodney Bock experienced \n22 physical pain, severe emotional distress, mental anguish, loss of his life, and the damages alleged \n23 herein. \n24 126.  The aforementioned acts and/or omissions of the individually named Defendants \n25 were malicious, reckless and/or accomplished with a conscious disregard of decedent’s rights \n26 thereby entitling Plaintiffs to an award of exemplary and punitive damages according to proof. \n27\n28\n27 \nCOMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, SECTION 504, AND \n  STATE LAW - NO.

Zil; Christopher Barnett; and Sadoutounnissa\n14 Meer (collectively “Defendants”) for injuries sustained as a\n15 result of Decedent’s suicide while incarcerated at Sutter County\n16 Jail (“Jail”).  Presently before the Court is Defendants’ Motion\n17 to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint.  For the\n18 following reasons, Defendants’ Motion is GRANTED.1 \n19\n20 BACKGROUND2\n21\n22 Decedent was a self-employed farmer in Marysville, California,\n23 for over 30 years.  In late 2009, he began experiencing mental\n24 health issues and required psychiatric treatment.  \n25\n1 Because oral argument will not be of material assistance, the\n26 Court ordered this matter submitted on the briefs.  E.D. Cal.\nLocal Rule 230(g).\n27\n2 The following facts are derived from Plaintiffs’ First Amended\n28 Complaint (“FAC”).  \n2\n\n1 On several occasions from 2009 through 2010, Decedent was\n2 involuntarily hospitalized pursuant to California Welfare &\n3 Institutions Code § 5150 at the Sutter-Yuba Mental Health\n4 Services facility (“SYMHS”),3 which was operated and managed by\n5 Defendants County of Sutter and County of Yuba.  \n6 SYMHS provides a variety of mental health care services to\n7 adults residing in Sutter and Yuba counties and to inmates of the\n8 Jail.  Because SYMHS has only roughly sixteen inpatient beds,\n9 nine to eleven of which are typically filled at any one time,\n10 Plaintiffs believe SYMHS staff members personally know, or should\n11 know, all patients. \n12 Decedent was first hospitalized at SYMHS on approximately\n13 November 30, 2009.  During that time, he was documented as\n14 psychotic, delusional and grandiose.  Defendant Barnett and other\n15 staff evaluated and treated Decedent and diagnosed him with,\n16 among other things, “Bipolar I Disorder, Most Recent Episode\n17 Manic, Severe with Psychotic Features.”  \n18 On various occasions, Decedent did indeed exhibit delusional\n19 and paranoid behavior, and, eventually, on or around January 14,\n20 2010, Decedent entered a restaurant with a gun and began making\n21 erratic statements.  As a result of that incident, Decedent was\n22 arrested, criminal charges were filed against him, and he was\n23 taken to the Jail.  \n24 ///\n25 ///\n26\n27 3 On two occasions, Decedent was involuntarily held for\nadditional periods pursuant to California Welfare & Institutions\n28 Code § 5250.  \n3\n\n1 According to Plaintiffs, the Jail has the capacity to house\n2 approximately two-hundred prisoners, and, given its relatively\n3 small size, Jail staff and supervisors must therefore have, or\n4 reasonably should have, personal knowledge of all prisoners,\n5 especially those exhibiting psychotic behaviors.  \n6 On January 15, 2010, while still housed at the Jail,\n7 Decedent was referred to SYMHS for a psychiatric evaluation, at\n8 which time SYMHS staff again documented his psychiatric history,\n9 which included his history of delusions.  In addition, later in\n10 January, after Decedent had been released from the Jail, he was\n11 again treated at SYMHS, pursuant to one of the above-mentioned\n12 involuntary holds, by Defendants Barnett and Meer and other\n13 staff, some of whom confirmed Decedent’s serious psychiatric\n14 diagnoses and recommended 15-minute safety checks and daily\n15 treatment.\n16 Subsequently, on or around January 27, 2010, the Sutter\n17 County Superior Court judge presiding over Decedent’s then-\n18 pending criminal case ordered Decedent to undergo a separate\n19 psychological evaluation to determine whether he was competent to\n20 stand trial.  The physician conducting that evaluation concluded\n21 that Decedent’s highly unstable psychiatric condition rendered\n22 him incompetent to be tried.  \n23 Approximately one month later, on March 1, 2010, another\n24 Sutter County Superior Court judge ordered a placement evaluation\n25 of Decedent.  A different physician than the one who evaluated\n26 Decedent’s competency confirmed Decedent’s psychiatric history\n27 and recommended that Decedent receive outpatient treatment.  \n28 ///\n4\n\n1 Later, on March 25, 2010, Decedent attended a psychiatric\n2 appointment with Defendant Meer, who documented that Decedent\n3 remained delusional.  \n4 Sometime after this last appointment, Decedent, who still\n5 continued to experience paranoia and delusions, began to believe\n6 he was being “direct[ed]” to drive to his nephew’s home in Idaho. \n7 Decedent eventually followed that “direction” but was returned to\n8 California by his nephew.  In the meantime, however, Decedent had\n9 missed a court date and, as a result, a warrant had been issued\n10 for his arrest.  \n11 Upon his return to California, Decedent was again taken to\n12 SYMHS for evaluation and treatment.  SYMHS staff confirmed\n13 Decedent’s prior diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder, Manic with\n14 Severe Psychotic Features, and identified his need for inpatient\n15 hospitalization or “state hospital placement.”  Defendant Barnett\n16 also documented that Decedent was sharing delusions of “end\n17 times.”  \n18 Notwithstanding these observations, on April 2, Defendants\n19 discharged and transferred Decedent, pursuant to the pending\n20 warrant, to the custody of Sutter County Sheriff’s Department,\n21 and he was again placed at the Jail.  According to Plaintiffs,\n22 Defendants transferred Decedent to the Jail in contravention of\n23 California Welfare & Institutions Code § 5152(a) and despite\n24 their knowledge of Decedent’s urgent need for inpatient care. \n25 Plaintiffs also generally allege that, at the time of Decedent’s\n26 discharge, Defendant Barnett and SYMHS staff provided a wholly\n27 inadequate treatment plan for Decedent. \n28 /// \n5\n\n1 Plaintiffs nonetheless further aver that, on the day of\n2 Decedent’s transfer, Defendant Zil advised a Jail nurse that\n3 Decedent was to continue taking his current medications.  Two\n4 days later, SYMHS and/or Sutter County Sheriff’s Department staff\n5 documented Decedent’s “continued delusions” and need for further\n6 psychiatric review, and, on April 8, Defendant Zil personally met\n7 with Decedent.  \n8 Also at around this same time, the physician who had\n9 conducted Decedent’s original court-ordered placement evaluation\n10 sent a letter to the court retracting his outpatient treatment\n11 recommendation.  Shortly thereafter, on April 19, the judge who\n12 had ordered Decedent’s placement evaluation found Decedent\n13 incompetent to stand trial, suspended all pending proceedings,\n14 and ordered that Decedent be transferred to Napa State Hospital\n15 for treatment.  Defendant Parker, who as Sheriff was under a\n16 statutory duty to ensure Decedent was transferred in accordance\n17 with the Court’s order, and all other Defendants, nonetheless\n18 failed to transfer Decedent in accordance with that order.  \n19 By April 24, Decedent was unstable and unkempt, was talking\n20 to himself and to inanimate objects and was refusing his\n21 medication.  According to Plaintiffs, no further evaluation of\n22 Decedent was conducted, however, nor was any further treatment\n23 undertaken.  To the contrary, Defendant Meer, who was scheduled\n24 to follow up with Decedent on April 28, failed to attend that\n25 appointment. \n26 ///\n27 ///\n28 ///\n6\n\n1 Plaintiffs thus allege Defendants failed to appropriately\n2 assess and medicate Decedent upon his incarceration at the Jail. \n3 More specifically, Plaintiffs allege Defendants failed to\n4 appropriately assess Decedent’s suicide risk.  Consequently, on\n5 April 29, using items that Plaintiffs allege should not have been\n6 permitted in Decedent’s cell due to his psychiatric condition,\n7 Decedent fashioned a noose and hanged himself from the upper\n8 bunk.  When he was found, there were large amounts of blood\n9 covering the cell floor and walls, apparently a result of\n10 Decedent banging his head against the wall in a very violent\n11 manner.  Decedent died in his cell.\n12 By this suit, Plaintiffs now assert eleven causes of action\n13 against Defendants arising out of Decedent’s death.  Defendants\n14 moved to dismiss each claim and to strike Plaintiffs’ request for\n15 punitive damages.  For the following reasons, Defendants’ Motion\n16 to Dismiss is GRANTED and Defendants’ request to strike\n17 Plaintiffs’ prayer for punitive damages is DENIED as moot.  \n18\n19 STANDARD\n20\n21 Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6),4 all\n22 allegations of material fact must be accepted as true and\n23 construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. \n24 Cahill v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 80 F.3d 336, 337-38 (9th Cir.\n25 1996).  \n26 ///\n27\n4 All further references to “Rule” or “Rules” are to the Federal\n28 Rules of Civil Procedure unless otherwise noted.\n7\n\n1 Rule 8(a)(2) “requires only ‘a short and plain statement of the\n2 claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,’ in order\n3 to ‘give the defendant fair notice of what the [...] claim is and\n4 the grounds upon which it rests.’”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,\n5 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41,\n6 47 (1957)).  A complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to\n7 dismiss does not require detailed factual allegations.  However,\n8 “a plaintiff’s obligation to provide the grounds of his\n9 entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions,\n10 and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action\n11 will not do.”  Id. (internal citations and quotations omitted). \n12 A court is not required to accept as true a “legal conclusion\n13 couched as a factual allegation.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S.\n14 662, ___, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1950 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S.\n15 at 555).  “Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to\n16 relief above the speculative level.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555\n17 (citing 5 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal\n18 Practice and Procedure § 1216 (3d ed. 2004) (stating that the\n19 pleading must contain something more than “a statement of facts\n20 that merely creates a suspicion [of] a legally cognizable right\n21 of action.”)). \n22 Furthermore, “Rule 8(a)(2)... requires a ‘showing,’ rather\n23 than a blanket assertion, of entitlement to relief.”  Twombly,\n24 550 U.S. at 556 n.3 (internal citations and quotations omitted). \n25 Thus, “[w]ithout some factual allegation in the complaint, it is\n26 hard to see how a claimant could satisfy the requirements of\n27 providing not only ‘fair notice’ of the nature of the claim, but\n28 also ‘grounds’ on which the claim rests.”  \n8\n\n1 Id. (citing 5 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, supra, at\n2 § 1202).  A pleading must contain “only enough facts to state a\n3 claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Id. at 570.  If\n4 the “plaintiffs ... have not nudged their claims across the line\n5 from conceivable to plausible, their complaint must be\n6 dismissed.”  Id.  However, “[a] well-pleaded complaint may\n7 proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of\n8 those facts is improbable, and ‘that a recovery is very remote\n9 and unlikely.’”  Id. at 556 (quoting Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S.\n10 232, 236 (1974)).\n11 A court granting a motion to dismiss a complaint must then\n12 decide whether to grant leave to amend.  Leave to amend should be\n13 “freely given” where there is no “undue delay, bad faith or\n14 dilatory motive on the part of the movant, ... undue prejudice to\n15 the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, [or]\n16 futility of the amendment ....”  Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178,\n17 182 (1962); Eminence Capital, LLC v. Aspeon, Inc., 316 F.3d 1048,\n18 1052 (9th Cir. 2003) (listing the Foman factors as those to be\n19 considered when deciding whether to grant leave to amend).  Not\n20 all of these factors merit equal weight.  Rather, “the\n21 consideration of prejudice to the opposing party ... carries the\n22 greatest weight.”  Eminence Capital, 316 F.3d at 1052 (citing DCD\n23 Programs, Ltd. v. Leighton, 833 F.2d 183, 185 (9th Cir. 1987)). \n24 Dismissal without leave to amend is proper only if it is clear\n25 that “the complaint could not be saved by any amendment.” \n26 Intri-Plex Techs. v. Crest Group, Inc., 499 F.3d 1048, 1056\n27 (9th Cir. 2007) (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n28 ///\n9\n\n1 ANALYSIS\n2\n3 At the outset, the Court notes that Plaintiffs seek relief\n4 for the events that transpired from April 1 to April 29, 2010. \n5 See Plaintiffs’ Opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss\n6 (“Plt. Opp.”) (ECF No. 16) at pg. 1.  In viewing the facts in the\n7 light most favorable to the non-moving party, however, Decedent’s\n8 treatment at SYMHS prior to April 1, 2010, as well as other\n9 events leading up his detention in April 2010, are relevant to\n10 Plaintiffs’ claims and will be considered herein.  \n11\nA. Plaintiffs’ First Through Third Causes of Action for\n12 Deliberate Indifference to Decedent’s Serious Medical\nNeeds.\n13\n14 In their first through third causes of action, Plaintiffs\n15 seek relief under the Fourteenth Amendment for Defendants’\n16 alleged deliberate indifference to Decedent’s serious medical\n17 needs.  The first cause of action is directed at all Defendants,\n18 while the second and third causes of action are asserted against\n19 the municipal and supervisory defendants, respectively.  The\n20 Court now addresses Plaintiffs’ claims by category of Defendant.  \n21\n22 1. Plaintiffs’ First Cause of Action Alleged Against\nthe Individual Defendants.\n23\n24 According to Plaintiffs, Defendants Zil, Barnett, and Meer\n25 “knew there was a strong likelihood that [Decedent] was in danger\n26 of serious personal harm...,” and their failure to provide mental\n27 heath care to him thus constituted deliberate indifference in\n28 violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n10\n\n1 Defendants argue that Plaintiffs failed to plead facts sufficient\n2 to demonstrate Defendants Zil, Barnett and Meer’s actions\n3 violated Decedent’s constitutional rights.              \n4 As opposed to prisoner claims under the Eighth Amendment, a\n5 pretrial detainee is entitled to be free of cruel and unusual\n6 punishment under the due process clause of the Fourteenth\n7 Amendment.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 537 n.16 (1979);\n8 Simmons v. Navajo Cnty., Ariz., 609 F.3d 1011, 1017-18 (9th Cir.\n9 2010).  A pretrial detainee’s due process right in this regard is\n10 violated when a defendant fails to promptly and reasonably\n11 procure competent medical aid when the pretrial detainee suffers\n12 a serious illness or injury while confined.  Estelle v. Gamble,\n13 429 U.S. 97, 104-05 (1976).  In order to establish a plausible\n14 claim for failure to provide medical treatment, a plaintiff must\n15 plead sufficient facts to permit the Court to infer that:\n16 (1) Decedent had a “serious medical need”; and (2) a Defendant\n17 was “deliberately indifferent” to that need.  Jett v. Penner,\n18 439 F.3d 1091, 1096 (9th Cir. 2006); cf. Farmer v. Brennan,\n19 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994).  A serious medical need exists when\n20 “failure to treat a prisoner’s condition could result in further\n21 significant injury or the unnecessary and wanton infliction of\n22 pain.”  Jett, 439 F.3d at 1096 (internal citations and quotations\n23 omitted). \n24 ///\n25 ///\n26 ///\n27 ///\n28 ///\n11\n\n1 The Supreme Court, in Farmer, explained in detail the\n2 contours of the “deliberate indifference” standard. \n3 Specifically, a Defendant is not liable under the Fourteenth\n4 Amendment for his part in allegedly denying necessary medical\n5 care unless he knew “of and disregard[ed] an excessive risk to\n6 [Decedent’s] health or safety.”  511 U.S. at 837.  Deliberate\n7 indifference contains both an objective and subjective component:\n8 “the official must both be aware of facts from which the\n9 inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm\n10 exists, and he must also draw that inference.”  Id.  Plaintiffs\n11 “need not show that a prison official acted or failed to act\n12 believing that harm actually would befall an inmate; it is enough\n13 that the official acted or failed to act despite his knowledge of\n14 a substantial risk of serious harm.”  Id. at 842. \n15 Negligence in diagnosing or treating a medical condition\n16 does not, however, give rise to a claim under the Eighth\n17 Amendment.  See Estelle, 429 U.S. at 106.  Moreover, a difference\n18 of opinion between the prisoner and medical providers concerning\n19 the appropriate course of treatment does not give rise to an\n20 Eighth Amendment claim.  See Jackson v. McIntosh, 90 F.3d 330,\n21 332 (9th Cir. 1996).\n22 In the FAC, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Zil, a\n23 psychiatrist contracted to provide care to SYMHS patients and\n24 Sutter County Jail inmates, treated Decedent in November and\n25 December of 2009, as well as in April 2010.  On April 2, 2010,\n26 Defendant Zil allegedly communicated with a nurse at SYMHS and\n27 ordered that Decedent continue taking his currently prescribed\n28 medications.  \n12\n\n1 In addition, on April 8, Defendant Zil personally met with\n2 Decedent.5  While Plaintiffs nonetheless claim that Defendant Zil\n3 failed to adequately assess and treat Decedent, those conclusory\n4 allegations are insufficient to state a claim for deliberate\n5 indifference.  Indeed, Plaintiffs have directed most of their\n6 allegations at “Defendants” generally, making it impossible to\n7 discern which Defendants were responsible for which actions.  \n8 More to the point, Plaintiffs have not alleged any facts\n9 indicating Defendant Zil, or any other Defendant for that matter,\n10 actually had any indication Decedent might intend to cause harm\n11 to himself.  For example, while Plaintiffs allege that Defendants\n12 Barnett and Meer, both psychiatrists employed by SYHMS, evaluated\n13 and treated Decedent prior to his April incarceration, Plaintiffs\n14 fail to allege that either Defendant had contact with Decedent\n15 during anytime in April 2010.  In addition, although Plaintiffs\n16 allege that Defendant Meer missed an April 28, 2010, appointment\n17 with Decedent, there are no facts pled demonstrating that\n18 Defendant Meer had a “sufficiently culpable mind” in doing so. \n19 See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834.  Accordingly, while a failure to\n20 treat Decedent’s condition could potentially give rise to a\n21 constitutional violation, Plaintiffs have not pled the requisite\n22 facts relating to the individual Defendants.  Plaintiffs’ first\n23 cause of action directed at Defendants Zil, Barnett and Meer is\n24 thus dismissed with leave to amend. \n25 ///\n26\n5 Plaintiffs have advised in their Opposition that they intend to\n27 amend their pleading based on newly discovered facts indicating\nDefendant Zil never visited Decedent or provided any treatment at\n28 the jail.  Pls. Opp. 9 n.5.  \n13\n\n1 2.  Plaintiffs’ First and Third Causes of Action\nAlleged Against the Supervisory Defendants.\n2\n3 In their first and third claims for relief, Plaintiffs\n4 allege that Defendants Parker, Sherry, Bhattal and Luz are liable\n5 for the deliberate indifference of other named Defendants because\n6 the other Defendants’ acts were a direct and proximate result of\n7 customs, practices, and policies of these supervisory Defendants. \n8 Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ claims against the supervisory\n9 Defendants must be dismissed because Plaintiffs failed to\n10 identify any pertinent policies or practices attributable to\n11 Defendants Parker, Sherry, Bhattal and Luz and because Plaintiffs\n12 improperly ascribe all purported failures very generally to the\n13 Defendants as a group.      \n14 “In order for a person acting under color of state law to be\n15 liable under section 1983 there must be a showing of personal\n16 participation in the alleged rights deprivation: there is no\n17 respondeat superior liability under section 1983.”  Jones v.\n18 Williams, 297 F.3d 930, 934 (9th Cir. 2002).  “Supervisory\n19 liability is imposed against a supervisory official in his\n20 individual capacity for his own culpable action or inaction in\n21 the training, supervision, or control of his subordinates, for\n22 his acquiescence in the constitutional deprivations of which the\n23 complaint is made, or for conduct that showed a reckless or\n24 callous indifference to the rights of others.”  Menotti v. City\n25 of Seattle, 409 F.3d 1113, 1149 (9th Cir. 2005) (quoting Larez v.\n26 City of Los Angeles, 946 F.2d 630, 646 (9th Cir. 1991)).  \n27 ///\n28 ///\n14\n\n1 In other words, each government official may only be held liable\n2 for his own misconduct.  Bowell v. Cal. Substance Abuse Treatment\n3 Facility, 2011 WL 2224817, at *4 (E.D. Cal. June 7, 2011).  \n4 However, government officials acting as supervisors may be\n5 liable under § 1983 under certain circumstances.  A defendant may\n6 be held liable as a supervisor under § 1983 if there exists\n7 either: “(1) his or her personal involvement in the\n8 Constitutional deprivation, or (2) a sufficient causal connection\n9 between the supervisor’s wrongful conduct and the constitutional\n10 violation.”  Hansen v. Black, 885 F.2d 642, 646 (9th Cir. 1989). \n11 Thus, Section 1983 actions against supervisors are proper as long\n12 as a sufficient causal connection exists and the plaintiff was\n13 deprived under color of law of a federally secured right. \n14 Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1207 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting\n15 Redman v. Cnty. of San Diego, 942 F.2d 1435, 1447 (9th Cir.\n16 1991)).\n17 The requisite causal connection between a supervisor’s\n18 wrongful conduct and the violation of the prisoner’s\n19 constitutional rights can be established in a number of ways. \n20 Plaintiffs may show that a supervisor set in motion a series of\n21 acts by others, or knowingly refused to terminate a series of\n22 acts by others, which the supervisor knew or reasonably should\n23 have known would cause others to inflict a Constitutional injury. \n24 Dubner v. City of S.F., 266 F.3d 959, 968 (9th Cir. 2001). \n25 Similarly, a supervisor’s own culpable action or inaction in the\n26 training, supervision, or control of his subordinates may\n27 establish supervisory liability.  Starr, 652 F.3d at 1208.\n28 ///\n15\n\n1 Finally, a supervisor’s acquiescence in the alleged\n2 constitutional deprivation, or conduct showing deliberate\n3 indifference toward the possibility that deficient performance of\n4 the task may violate the rights of others, may establish the\n5 requisite causal connection.  Id.; Menotti, 409 F.3d at 1149.\n6 Defendants correctly argue that, as with the individual\n7 Defendants, Plaintiffs have failed to plead facts demonstrating\n8 each supervisory Defendant’s role in any alleged deprivation.6 \n9 Without some specific allegations against each named Defendant,\n10 Plaintiffs’ claims cannot withstand Defendants’ Motion to\n11 Dismiss.  \n12  \n13 3.  Plaintiff’s First and Second Causes of Action\nAlleged Against the Municipal Defendants.  \n14\n15 In their first and second claims for relief, Plaintiffs\n16 allege that Defendants County of Sutter and County of Yuba\n17 violated the Fourteenth Amendment because the individually named\n18 Defendants’ deliberate indifference toward Decedent was a direct\n19 and proximate result of County of Sutter and County of Yuba’s\n20 policies, customs or practices.  \n21 ///\n22 ///\n23 ///\n24\n25 6 The Court is cognizant that Plaintiffs have attempted to allege\nDefendant Parker failed to comply with the superior court order\n26 to transfer Decedent to Napa State Hospital.  While such a\nfailure would certainly be significant, Plaintiffs have alleged\n27 no facts indicating Sheriff Parker had or should have had any\nindication the court order had been issued or that Defendant\n28 Parker failed to act on any such information.  \n16\n\n1 Defendants argue that because there was an actual policy in place\n2 regarding the identification and treatment of mental disorders,\n3 Plaintiffs’ claims dependent on other policies regarding the\n4 treatment of inmates are inconsistent and must fail.  Defendants\n5 also argue that the policies identified by Plaintiffs were not\n6 the moving force behind any alleged constitutional violations.    \n7 A municipality may be liable for violating a party’s\n8 constitutional rights resulting from a policy, ordinance, or\n9 regulation pursuant to a governmental custom.  Monell v. Dep’t of\n10 Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658 (1978).  The policy must be the\n11 “moving force” behind the constitutional violation.  Villegas v.\n12 Gilroy Garlic Festival Ass’n, 541 F.3d 950 (9th Cir. 2008).\n13 Section 1983 requires that there is an actual connection or link\n14 between the actions of a defendant and the deprivation alleged to\n15 have been suffered by the plaintiff.  Id. \n16 In order to survive Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, then,\n17 Plaintiffs must allege sufficient facts to permit the court to\n18 infer the plausibility of each of the following elements: (1) an\n19 employee violated the Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights; (2) the\n20 municipality has customs or policies that amount to deliberate\n21 indifference to those rights; and (3) those customs or policies\n22 were the moving force behind the violation of the employee’s\n23 constitutional rights.  Gibson v. County of Washoe, 290 F.3d\n24 1175, 1193-94 (9th Cir. 2002).  As set forth in the preceding\n25 sections, Plaintiffs have failed to plead facts sufficient to\n26 demonstrate any employee violated Plaintiffs’ constitutional\n27 rights.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ claims against Defendants\n28 County of Sutter and County of Yuba must fail.\n17\n\n1 B. Plaintiffs’ Fourth Cause of Action for Loss of\nParent/child Relationship. \n2\n3 Plaintiffs’ fourth cause of action asserts that all\n4 Defendants violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments by\n5 depriving Plaintiffs of their liberty interest in the parent-\n6 child relationship.  The due process claim protects the right to\n7 familial relations between family members.  See, e.g., Stanley v.\n8 Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651 (1972) (“The integrity of the family\n9 unit has found protection in the Due Process Clause of the\n10 Fourteenth Amendment....”) (citing Meyer v. Nebraksa, 262 U.S.\n11 390, 399 (1923)).  However, only official conduct that “shocks\n12 the conscience” is cognizable as a due process violation.  County\n13 of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 846 (1998) (citing\n14 Rochin v. Cal., 342 U.S. 165, 172-73 (1952)).  The threshold\n15 question in such cases is “whether the behavior of the\n16 governmental officer is so egregious, so outrageous, that it may\n17 fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.”  Lewis,\n18 523 U.S. at 847 n. 8.  The type of conduct which is most likely\n19 to rise to the “conscience-shocking level” is “conduct intended\n20 to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest.” \n21 Id. at 849.  Conduct which was not intentional, but rather was\n22 deliberately indifferent, may nevertheless rise to the\n23 conscience-shocking level in some circumstances.  Id. at 849–50. \n24 ///\n25 ///\n26 ///\n27 ///\n28 ///\n18\n\n1 Plaintiffs’ instant claim is predicated on the allegations\n2 set forth in Plaintiffs’ first, second, and third causes of\n3 action.  More specifically, Plaintiffs allege that the\n4 “aforementioned acts and/or omissions of Defendants in being\n5 deliberatively indifferent to [Decedent],” through their direct\n6 actions or failure to take measures to prevent Decedent’s\n7 suicide, amount to a violation of the Plaintiffs’ rights under\n8 the substantive due process clauses of the first and fourteenth\n9 amendments.  For the same reasons already discussed in the\n10 preceding section, Plaintiffs’ general allegations that\n11 Defendants were deliberately indifferent to Decedent’s serious\n12 medical needs are likewise insufficient to demonstrate that any\n13 Defendant’s conduct “shocks the conscience.”  Indeed, Plaintiffs\n14 did not plead facts demonstrating any Defendant’s conduct meets\n15 the requisite standard to establish a substantive due process\n16 violation.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ fourth claim for relief is\n17 dismissed with leave to amend.  \n18\n19 C. Plaintiffs’ Fifth Cause of Action for Violation of\nTitle Ii of the Americans with Disabilities Act and\n20 Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.\n21\n22 In their fifth cause of action, Plaintiffs allege that\n23 Defendants County of Sutter and County of Yuba discriminated\n24 against Decedent in violation of the Americans with Disabilities\n25 Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131, et seq., and the Rehabilitation\n26 Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 701, et seq., because “he was not placed in a\n27 setting, or provided appropriate services, to reasonably\n28 accommodate his disability and treatment needs.”  \n19\n\n1 Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ claims under the ADA and\n2 Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act must be dismissed because\n3 Plaintiffs fail to present facts identifying how Decedent was\n4 denied treatment, or which particular programs Decedent was\n5 denied access to, because of his disability.  In their\n6 Opposition, Plaintiffs argue that their claims are based on\n7 Defendants’ total withholding of treatment for Decedent and aver\n8 that Decedent “had no way to access services available to\n9 non-disabled inmates.”         \n10 Both the ADA and Rehabilitation Act prohibit disability\n11 discrimination.  Specifically, Title II of the ADA provides that\n12 “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of\n13 such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied\n14 the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public\n15 entity, or be subject to discrimination by such entity.” \n16 42 U.S.C. § 12132.  The ADA defines “public entity” in relevant\n17 part as “any State or local government” or “any department,\n18 agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a\n19 State or States or local government,” 42 U.S.C.\n20 § 12131(1)(A)-(B), and the Supreme Court has found that “[s]tate\n21 prisons fall squarely within the [statute’s] definition of public\n22 entity.”  Pennsylvania Dep’t of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.S.\n23 206, 210 (1952) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \n24 ///\n25 ///\n26 ///\n27 ///\n28 ///\n20\n\n1 Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act states that “[n]o otherwise\n2 qualified handicapped individual in the United States...shall,\n3 solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the\n4 participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\n5 discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal\n6 financial assistance.”  29 U.S.C. § 794.  Both the ADA and the\n7 Rehabilitation Act have been found to apply to services,\n8 programs, and activities for detainees.  See, e.g., Pierce v.\n9 County of Orange, 526 F.3d 1190, 1214-1215 (9th Cir. 2008). \n10 Although Plaintiffs allege Decedent did not receive adequate\n11 medical treatment, there are no facts in the FAC demonstrating\n12 that Defendants did not provide treatment to Decedent because he\n13 was disabled.  See Alexander v. Tilton, 2009 WL 464486 at *7\n14 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 24, 2009) (finding plaintiff’s allegations that\n15 he did not receive proper medical treatment did not state a claim\n16 under the ADA or Rehabilitation Act).  Put differently,\n17 Plaintiffs have not pled that Decedent was treated differently\n18 than other inmates who did not suffer from a disability.  Compare\n19 Peacock v. Terhune, 2002 WL 459928 at *2 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 23,\n20 2002) (finding a plaintiff stated a claim under the ADA because\n21 he alleged he was treated differently, as a paraplegic, than\n22 other inmates who did not suffer from the same, or a similar,\n23 disability).  Although Plaintiffs argue in their opposition that\n24 Decedent did not have access to services that were made available\n25 to non-disabled inmates, Plaintiffs do not cite to any part of\n26 their FAC to substantiate their position.  \n27 ///\n28 ///\n21\n\n1 Plaintiffs do cite a case from the Northern District to\n2 support their argument that “‘outright denial of medical\n3 services’...may be ‘so unreasonable as to demonstrate that\n4 [defendants] were discriminating against [plaintiff] because of\n5 his disability.’” Anderson v. County of Siskiyou, 2010 WL 3619821\n6 at *5 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 13, 2010) (quoting Kiman v. New Hampshire\n7 Dep’t of Corr., 451 F.3d 274, 285 (1st Cir. 2006)).  However,\n8 that case has not been cited by any court for that proposition,\n9 and other courts within this circuit have, to the contrary,\n10 required plaintiffs to plead facts demonstrating they were\n11 treated differently because of their disabilities.  See Peacock,\n12 2002 WL 4599928 at *2; Alexander, 2009 WL 464486 at *7.  More\n13 importantly, the Ninth Circuit has made clear that “[t]he ADA\n14 prohibits discrimination because of disability, not inadequate\n15 treatment for disability.”  Simmons v. Navajo County, Ariz.,\n16 609 F.3d 1011, 1022 (9th Cir. 2010).  Accordingly, this Court\n17 declines to follow Anderson and finds that Plaintiffs have failed\n18 to plead facts sufficient to allege that the Defendants\n19 discriminated against Decedent because of his disability. \n20 Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ fifth cause of action\n21 is GRANTED with leave to amend.    \n22\n23 D.  Plaintiffs’ Sixth Cause of Action for Violation of\nCalifornia’s Unruh Civil Rights Act. \n24\n25 Plaintiffs allege that Defendants County of Sutter and\n26 County of Yuba violated California Civil Code §§ 51 and 52\n27 (“Unruh Act”) by failing to reasonably accommodate Decedent’s\n28 disability and treatment needs.  \n22\n\n1 Defendants argue Plaintiffs’ claim must be dismissed because\n2 SYMHS and Sutter County Jail are not “business establishments”\n3 subject to the Unruh Act.  \n4 The Unruh Act provides that “[a]ll persons within the\n5 jurisdiction of this state are free and equal, and...are entitled\n6 to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities,\n7 privileges, or services in all business establishments of every\n8 kind whatsoever.”  Cal. Civ. Code § 51(b).  Although the\n9 California Supreme Court has found that the Legislature intended\n10 the term “business establishment” be interpreted “in the broadest\n11 sense reasonably possible,”  Isbister v. Boys’ Club of Santa\n12 Cruz, Inc., 40 Cal. 3d 72, 78 (1985), the Unruh Act has yet to be\n13 applied to claims against correctional facilities, see Lee v.\n14 Wilkinson, 2009 WL 2824758 at *7 (E.D. Cal. 2009).  Instead,\n15 several district courts have explicitly found that prisons are\n16 not business establishments under the Unruh Act.  See Taormina v.\n17 Cal. Dep’t of Corr., 946 F. Supp. 829, 834 (S.D. Cal. 1996);\n18 Wilkins-Jones v. County of Alameda, 2010 WL 4780291 at *9 (N.D.\n19 Cal. 2010) (finding defendant County of Alameda was not liable\n20 under Unruh Act).  The Court finds this authority persuasive and\n21 holds that Sutter County Jail is not a business establishment\n22 under the Unruh Act.7  Accordingly, Plaintiffs claim under the\n23 Unruh Act arising out of Decedent’s treatment at Sutter County\n24 Jail fails.  \n25\n26 7 Plaintiffs’ analogy to public school districts is unpersuasive,\nas it has been well established that public school districts are\n27 business establishments subject to the Unruh Act.  See, e.g.,\nD.K. ex rel. G.M. v. Solano County Office of Educ., 2008 WL\n28 5114965 at *6 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 2, 2008). \n23\n\n1 Notably, Plaintiffs do not distinguish between SYMHS and\n2 Sutter County Jail in their FAC or Opposition.  Without deciding\n3 whether SYHMS is subject to the Unruh Act at this point, the\n4 Court finds it also appropriate to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims\n5 relating to Decedent’s treatment at SYMHS because Plaintiffs have\n6 not alleged facts substantiating their conclusory allegation that\n7 Decedent was discriminated against in violation of the Unruh Act\n8 while at SYMHS.               \n9\n10 E.  Plaintiffs’ Seventh Cause of Action for Professional\nNegligence/medical Malpractice.\n11\n12 Plaintiffs allege Defendants County of Sutter, County of\n13 Yuba, Zil, Barnett and Meer were negligent in their failure to\n14 properly assess and treat Decedent’s serious mental illness.  \n15 First and foremost, the entity Defendants move to dismiss\n16 this claim on the ground that they are immune from liability\n17 because Plaintiffs failed to provide a statutory basis for the\n18 cause of action.  Under California Government Code section 815,\n19 “a public entity is not liable for an injury, whether such injury\n20 arises out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public\n21 employee or any other person, except as provided by statute.” \n22 Cal. Gov. Code § 815(a).  Plaintiffs concede that Defendants’\n23 Motion to Dismiss should be granted as to the County of Sutter\n24 and County of Yuba in light of Section 815.  Accordingly, this\n25 claim against Defendants County of Sutter and County of Yuba is\n26 dismissed without leave to amend.  \n27 ///\n28 ///\n24\n\n1 Turning to the individually named Defendants, Plaintiffs\n2 generally allege that Defendants Zil, Barnett and Meer were\n3 negligent in their failure to appropriately assess and evaluate\n4 Decedent, to prescribe necessary psychiatric medication, to\n5 ensure compliance with that medication and to ensure proper\n6 treatment.  Plaintiffs further allege that Defendant Barnett was\n7 negligent in discharging Decedent from SYMHS to Sutter County\n8 Jail in early April 2010.  \n9 These Defendants argue that they are immune from liability\n10 under California Government Code sections 855.6 and 855.8. \n11 Section 855.6 shields a public employee from liability “for\n12 injury caused by the failure to make a[n] examination, or to make\n13 an adequate [] examination,...for the purpose of determining\n14 whether [a] person has a...mental condition that would constitute\n15 a hazard to the health and safety of himself or others.” \n16 Similarly, Section 855.8 provides that a public employee is not\n17 liable “for injury resulting from diagnosing or failing to\n18 diagnose that a person is afflicted with mental illness [] or\n19 from failing to prescribe for mental illness....”  Cal. Gov. Code\n20 § 855.8(a).  Defendants correctly argue that Plaintiffs’\n21 allegations regarding their alleged failure to properly assess\n22 and evaluate Decedent, as well as their alleged failure to\n23 prescribe appropriate medications, fall squarely within sections\n24 855.6 and 855.8, and therefore, they are immune from liability on\n25 that basis.  \n26 ///\n27 ///\n28 ///\n25\n\n1 Plaintiffs nonetheless argue that the immunity granted under\n2 section 855.6 does not apply in “situation[s] where the defendant\n3 fails to provide medical care for a prisoner in obvious need of\n4 such care,” as set forth in Lum v. City of San Joaquin,\n5 756 F. Supp. 2d 1243 (E.D. Cal. 2010).  However, Plaintiffs do\n6 not cite to any facts pled in their FAC demonstrating that it was\n7 “obvious” to Defendants Zil, Barnett and Meer that Decedent\n8 needed any care that they failed to provide.  Accordingly,\n9 Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is granted with respect to\n10 Plaintiffs’ negligence claims arising out of Defendants’ alleged\n11 failure to properly evaluate Decedent or prescribe medication for\n12 any mental condition.  \n13 Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding Defendants’ alleged\n14 failure to ensure Decedent complied with his prescriptions and\n15 received appropriate treatment arguably fall within an exception\n16 to immunity codified in Section 855.8(d).  See Cal. Gov. Code\n17 § 855.8(d) (employee not shielded from liability for an injury\n18 “caused by his negligent or wrongful act or omission in\n19 administering any treatment prescribed for mental illness....”). \n20 Defendants, however, correctly point out that Plaintiffs’ FAC\n21 does not contain facts relating to each individually named\n22 Defendant’s failure to ensure compliance with prescriptions or\n23 proper treatment.  Indeed, Plaintiffs only allege that Defendant\n24 Zil and other Defendants provided “grossly inadequate treatment”\n25 and that Defendant Meer failed to keep an appointment with\n26 Decedent.  These allegations alone do not demonstrate that any\n27 Defendant failed to properly administer any prescribed treatment,\n28 consequently causing Decedent’s death.  \n26\n\n1 Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ seventh\n2 claim for relief is granted as to this theory as well.\n3 Finally, although Plaintiffs allege Defendant Barnett\n4 negligently discharged Decedent on April 2, 2010, there are no\n5 facts in the FAC to support this allegation.  See FAC at ¶¶ 79-85\n6 (alleging, generally, that Defendants should not have discharged\n7 Decedent).  Plaintiffs allege that Decedent was seen by Defendant\n8 Barnett, but they do not plead any facts relating to a decision\n9 made by Defendant Barnett regarding Decedent’s transfer from\n10 SYHMS to Sutter County Jail.  Id.  Accordingly, without factual\n11 support, Plaintiffs’ claim that Defendant Barnett negligently\n12 discharged Decedent must be disregarded, see Twombly, 550 U.S. at\n13 555, and Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ seventh claim\n14 for relief relating to Defendant Barnett’s allegedly negligent\n15 discharge of Decedent is granted.  Plaintiffs’ seventh cause of\n16 action is thus dismissed with leave to amend.\n17\n18 F.  Plaintiffs’ Eight Cause of Action for Negligence/\nNegligence Per Se.\n19\n20 Plaintiffs allege that all individually named Defendants had\n21 a duty to operate and manage SYMHS and Sutter County Jail, as\n22 defined by various laws, standards and regulations, and\n23 Defendants’ breach of those duties caused Decedent’s injuries. \n24 Defendants correctly argue that Plaintiffs have failed to\n25 identify any specific statute, ordinance or regulation in support\n26 of their claim, and for this reason, Plaintiffs’ claim for\n27 negligence per se is dismissed with leave to amend.  \n28 ///\n27\n\n1 See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555; Cal. Evid. Code § 669 (1967);\n2 accord Lorbeer v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 958 F.2d 377 (9th\n3 Cir. 1992) (finding a plaintiff’s negligence per se claim failed\n4 “because he [did] not idenif[y] a specific, relevant statutory\n5 violation...”).    \n6\n7 G.  Plaintiffs’ Ninth Cause of Action for Negligent\nSupervision, Training, Hiring and Retention.\n8\n9 Plaintiffs allege Defendants Parker, Sherry, Bhattal and\n10 Luz were negligent in hiring, supervising, training and retaining\n11 employees and thus caused Decedent’s injuries.  Defendants\n12 correctly argue that Plaintiffs’ claim must be dismissed because\n13 Plaintiffs have failed to provide a statutory basis for their\n14 cause of action.  \n15 Plaintiffs’ ninth claim is really a claim against the\n16 entities and not the employees.  See, e.g., Sanders v. City of\n17 Fresno, 2006 WL 1883394, *11 (“‘Failure to train...is a “direct”\n18 act on the part of the entity, not on the part of the\n19 employee.’”) (quoting Reinhardt v. Santa Clara County, 2006 WL\n20 662741 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 15, 2006)); see also Megargee ex rel.\n21 Lopez v. Wittman, 2006 WL 2988945, *10 n.2 (E.D. Cal.).  Pursuant\n22 to California Government Code § 815, however, public entities\n23 cannot be held directly liable in tort except as specifically\n24 provided by statute.  Caldwell v. Montoya, 10 Cal. 4th 972, 980\n25 (1995).  Neither the parties nor the Court has identified a\n26 statutory basis for the entities’ liability in this case.  See,\n27 e.g., Megargee, 2006 WL 2988945 at *10.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’\n28 ninth cause of action must be dismissed.   \n28\n\n1 H.  Plaintiffs’ Tenth Cause of Action for Failure to\nFurnish/Summon Medical Care.\n2\n3 Plaintiffs allege that Defendants Parker, Sherry, Bhattal,\n4 Luz, Zil, Barnett and Meer knew, or had reason to know, that\n5 Decedent was in need of immediate medical and mental health care,\n6 yet they failed to take action to summon or provide care. \n7 Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants failed to timely\n8 respond to Decedent’s “psychotic episode” on April 29 when “he\n9 engaged in numerous acts of self-harm before hanging himself....” \n10 Defendants argue that because Plaintiffs’ FAC does not contain\n11 any facts relating to each individual Defendants’ actual or\n12 constructive knowledge of an immediate need for care for a\n13 serious or obvious medical condition, however, Plaintiffs’ tenth\n14 cause of action must be dismissed.     \n15 A claim for failure to furnish medical care is based on a\n16 violation of California Government Code § 845.6, which states in\n17 pertinent part:\n18 Neither a public entity nor a public employee is liable\nfor injury proximately caused by the failure of the\n19 employee to furnish or obtain medical care for a\nprisoner in his custody; but... a public employee, and\n20 the public entity where the employee is acting within\nthe scope of his employment, is liable if the employee\n21 knows or has reason to know that the prisoner is in\nneed of immediate medical care and he fails to take\n22 reasonable action to summon such medical care...”\n23 In their FAC, Plaintiffs only refer to one Defendant\n24 specifically that had contact with Decedent at Sutter County Jail\n25 between April 2 and April 29, 2010: Defendant Zil.  Specifically,\n26 Plaintiffs allege that on April 8, Zil had an in-person\n27 psychiatric meeting with Decedent.  \n28 ///\n29\n\n1 There are no further allegations, however, regarding Zil’s\n2 knowledge of Decedent’s immediate need for medical care and his\n3 subsequent failure to summon care.  Although Plaintiffs pled that\n4 Defendants generally knew, or should have known, about Decedent’s\n5 need for further psychiatric treatment, the facts presented by\n6 Plaintiffs in their FAC are not sufficient to demonstrate that\n7 each named Defendant had actual or constructive knowledge of\n8 Decedent’s immediate need for care.  Compare, e.g., Jett,\n9 439 F.3d 1091 (finding disputed issues of fact precluded summary\n10 judgment on the inmate-plaintiff’s failure to summon medical care\n11 claim because a doctor ordered follow-up visits for plaintiff\n12 following a fracture to his thumb and plaintiff filed repeated\n13 requests to be seen by a health care provider, which were ignored\n14 by defendants); see also Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  Accordingly,\n15 Plaintiffs’ claim for failure to summon medical care is dismissed\n16 with leave to amend. \n17\n18 I.  Plaintiffs’ Eleventh Cause of Action for Wrongful\nDeath.\n19\n20 Plaintiffs allege that Decedent’s injuries in this case are\n21 a result of the negligence of all Defendants, and therefore,\n22 Defendants are liable under California Code of Civil Procedure\n23 377.60 for the funeral and burial expenses incurred by\n24 Plaintiffs.  Defendants argue that this claim is duplicative of\n25 Plaintiffs’ negligence claim as to Defendants Zil, Barnett, and\n26 Meer.  Defendants further argue that Plaintiffs fail to allege\n27 facts sufficient to state a claim against the remaining\n28 Defendants for negligence.   \n30\n\n1 Plaintiffs correctly argue that a claim for wrongful death\n2 is a separate cause of action.  See Ruiz v. Podolsky, 50 Cal. 4th\n3 838, 844 (Cal. 2010).  Indeed, “‘[u]nlike some jurisdictions\n4 where wrongful death actions are derivative, [section] 377.60\n5 creates a new cause of action in favor of the heirs as\n6 beneficiaries, based upon their own independent pecuniary injury\n7 suffered by loss of a relative, and distinct from any the\n8 deceased might have maintained had he survived.’” Id. (quoting\n9 Horwich v. Superior Court, 21 Cal. 4th 272, 283 (Cal. 1999). \n10 However, Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts sufficient to\n11 demonstrate that Defendants’ negligence caused Decedent’s death. \n12 See supra at 5-8.  Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss\n13 Plaintiffs’ eleventh cause of action is granted with leave to\n14 amend.      \n15\n16 CONCLUSION\n17\n18 For the reasons set forth above, Defendants’ Motion to\n19 Dismiss (ECF No. 11) is GRANTED without leave to amend as to\n20 Plaintiffs’ seventh cause of action against Defendants County of\n21 Sutter and County of Yuba, and GRANTED with leave to amend as to\n22 all of Plaintiffs’ remaining claims.8  Not later than thirty (30)\n23 days following the date this Memorandum and Order is\n24 electronically filed, Plaintiff may (but is not required to) file\n25 a Second Amended Complaint.  \n26\n27 8 Given that this Court has dismissed Plaintiffs’ entire FAC,\nDefendants’ additional request to strike Plaintiffs’ prayer for\n28 punitive damages is DENIED as moot.  \n31\n\n1 If no amended complaint is filed within said thirty-day\n2 period, without further notice to the parties, those causes of\n3 action dismissed by virtue of this Order will be deemed dismissed\n4 with prejudice. \n5 IT IS SO ORDERED.    \n6\nDated: February 7, 2012\n7\n8\n_____________________________\nMORRISON C.

Presently before the Court is Defendants’ \n3  Motion to Dismiss (“Motion”) Plaintiffs’ Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”).1  For the \n4  following reasons, Defendants’ Motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.2 \n5   \n6  BACKGROUND3 \n \n7 \n8  Decedent was a self-employed farmer in Marysville, California, for over 30 years.  \n9  In late 2009, he began experiencing mental health issues and required psychiatric \n10  treatment.  On several occasions from 2009 through 2010, Decedent was involuntarily \n11  hospitalized pursuant to California Welfare & Institutions Code § 5150 (“Section 5150”) \n12  at the Sutter-Yuba Mental Health Services facility (“SYMHS”),4 which was operated and \n13  managed by Defendants County of Sutter and County of Yuba.   \n14  SYMHS provides a variety of mental health care services both to adults residing \n15  in Sutter and Yuba counties and to inmates at the Jail.  Because SYMHS has only \n16  roughly sixteen inpatient beds, nine to eleven of which are typically filled at any one time, \n17  Plaintiffs believe SYMHS staff members personally know, or should know, all patients.  \n18  /// \n19  /// \n20  /// \n21 \n                                            \n1  Within the Motion, Defendants also seek to strike Plaintiffs’ punitive damages \n22 \nallegations and move alternatively for a more definite statement.  Despite the potentially \n23  different standards governing these requests, the Court will for convenience refer to \nDefendants’ Motion generally as a Motion to Dismiss. \n24   \n2 Because oral argument will not be of material assistance, the Court ordered this \n25 \nmatter submitted on the briefs.  E.D. Cal. Local Rule 230(g). \n \n26 \n3 The following facts are derived from Plaintiffs’ TAC. \n27   \n4 On two occasions, Decedent was involuntarily held for additional periods \n28  pursuant to California Welfare & Institutions Code § 5250 (“Section 5250”).   \n  2\n \n \n\n \n1  Decedent was first hospitalized at SYMHS on approximately November 30, 2009.  \n2  During that time, he was documented as psychotic, delusional and grandiose.  \n3  Defendant Barnett, a psychiatrist employed by SYMHS, and other staff evaluated and \n4  treated Decedent and diagnosed him with, among other things, “Bipolar I Disorder, Most \n5  Recent Episode Manic, Severe with Psychotic Features.”   \n6  On various occasions, Decedent did indeed exhibit delusional and paranoid \n7  behavior, and, eventually, on or around January 14, 2010, Decedent was arrested as a \n8  result of an incident at an Applebee’s restaurant.  Criminal charges were filed against \n9  him, and he was taken to the Jail.  According to Plaintiffs, the Jail has the capacity to \n10  house approximately two-hundred prisoners, and, given its relatively small size, Jail staff \n11  and supervisors must therefore have, or reasonably should have, personal knowledge of \n12  all inmates, especially those exhibiting psychotic behaviors.   \n13  On January 15, 2010, while still housed at the Jail, Decedent was referred to \n14  SYMHS for a psychiatric evaluation, at which time SYMHS staff again documented his \n15  psychiatric history, which included his history of delusions.  In addition, later in January, \n16  after Decedent had been released from the Jail, he was again treated at SYMHS, \n17  pursuant to one of the above-mentioned involuntary holds, by Barnett and other staff, \n18  some of whom confirmed Decedent’s serious psychiatric diagnoses and recommended \n19  15-minute safety checks and daily treatment. \n20  In the meantime, on or around January 27, 2010, the Sutter County Superior \n21  Court judge presiding over Decedent’s then-pending criminal case ordered Decedent to \n22  undergo a separate psychological evaluation to determine whether he was competent to \n23  stand trial.  The physician conducting that evaluation concluded that Decedent’s highly \n24  unstable psychiatric condition rendered him incompetent to be tried.   \n25  Just over one month later, on March 1, 2010, another Sutter County Superior \n26  Court judge ordered a placement evaluation of Decedent.  A different physician than the \n27  one who evaluated Decedent’s competency confirmed Decedent’s psychiatric history \n28  and recommended that Decedent receive outpatient treatment.   \n  3\n \n \n\n \n1  Subsequently, in late March, Decedent, who still continued to experience \n2  paranoia and delusions, began to believe he was being “direct[ed]” to drive to his \n3  nephew’s home in Idaho.  Decedent eventually followed that “direction,” but was \n4  returned to California by his nephew.  In the interim, however, Decedent had missed a \n5  court date and, as a result, a warrant had been issued for his arrest.   \n6  On April 1, 2010, Decedent was again taken by his family to SYMHS for \n7  evaluation and treatment.  Barnett confirmed Decedent’s prior diagnosis of Bipolar I \n8  Disorder, Manic with Severe Psychotic Features, and identified his need for inpatient \n9  hospitalization or “state hospital placement.”  The next day, Barnett determined that \n10  Decedent needed at least an additional two weeks of involuntary psychiatric \n11  hospitalization pursuant to Section 5150.  Decedent was thereafter required pursuant to \n12  Section 5150 to remain hospitalized for a 72-hour period of treatment and evaluation \n13  unless his psychiatrist believed after personal observation that he could leave earlier. \n14  Notwithstanding these observations, that same day, Barnett discharged and \n15  transferred Decedent, pursuant to the pending warrant, to the custody of Sutter County \n16  Sheriff’s Department, and he was again placed at the Jail.  According to Plaintiffs, \n17  Defendants transferred Decedent to the Jail in contravention of Welfare & Institutions \n18  Code § 5152 (“Section 5152”) and despite their knowledge of Decedent’s urgent need \n19  for inpatient care.  Plaintiffs also allege that, at the time of Decedent’s discharge, \n20  Defendant Barnett and SYMHS staff provided a wholly inadequate treatment plan for \n21  Decedent.  In addition, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Fliehman, as Deputy Officer of \n22  Sutter County Jail, improperly booked Decedent into the Jail without conducting an \n23  adequate assessment of his suicide risk and thus erroneously placed Decedent in a \n24  general population jail cell.  Decedent was held in custody at Sutter County Jail as a \n25  pretrial detainee from April 2, 2010, until April 29, 2010. \n26  /// \n27  /// \n28  /// \n  4\n \n \n\n \n1  During that time, Defendant Zil, who actually authored a Sutter County Jail \n2  Suicide Prevention Handbook in which he identified signs of suicide risk among jail \n3  inmates (e.g., visual or auditory hallucinations, severe paranoia, delusions and ideas of \n4  grandeur), was assigned as Decedent’s treating physician.  Zil was informed of \n5  Decedent’s condition and prescribed him psychiatric medication.  In total, Zil had one \n6  clinical contact with Decedent.  Given these facts, Plaintiffs allege that Zil knew or should \n7  have known that Decedent was refusing to take his prescribed psychiatric medications.   \n8  In the meantime, the physician who had conducted Decedent’s original court-\n9  ordered placement evaluation sent a letter to the court retracting his outpatient treatment \n10  recommendation.  Shortly thereafter, on April 19, the judge who had ordered Decedent’s \n11  placement evaluation found Decedent incompetent to stand trial, suspended all pending \n12  proceedings, and ordered that Decedent be transferred to Napa State Hospital for \n13  treatment.  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants Parker in his role as Sutter County Sheriff, \n14  Samson as Jail Commander, Bidwell as Jail Lieutenant, and the Sutter County Jail \n15  Facility Manager knew or should have known about this order, but nonetheless failed to \n16  transfer him, despite the fact the State Hospital was prepared to accept Decedent for \n17  treatment and had transmitted notice of its acceptance to these Defendants. \n18  Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants Little and Calapini as officers assigned to \n19  Decedent’s general housing pod, R.C. who was responsible for providing mental health \n20  and/or medical services at the Jail, and Sutter County Jail Nurses Mullin and McGinnis \n21  each had interactions with and observations of Decedent in the days prior to his death.  \n22  It is alleged that each Defendant observed and documented one or more indicators that \n23  Decedent required further treatment. \n24  By April 24, Decedent was unstable and unkempt, was talking to himself and to \n25  inanimate objects and was refusing his medication.  According to Plaintiffs, no further \n26  evaluation of Decedent was conducted, however, nor was any further treatment \n27  undertaken.  \n28  /// \n  5\n \n \n\n \n1  Plaintiffs thus allege Defendants failed to appropriately assess and medicate \n2  Decedent upon his incarceration at the Jail.  More specifically, Plaintiffs allege \n3  Defendants failed to appropriately assess Decedent’s suicide risk.  In addition, Plaintiffs \n4  contend that, on April 29, 2010, Defendants Little and Calapini were responsible for \n5  conducting hourly safety checks of Decedent.  They failed, however, to conduct the 8:00 \n6  p.m. check and, consequently, using items that Plaintiffs allege should not have been \n7  permitted in Decedent’s cell due to his psychiatric condition, Decedent fashioned a \n8  noose and hanged himself from the upper bunk.  When he was found, there were large \n9  amounts of blood covering the cell floor and walls, apparently a result of Decedent \n10  banging his head against the wall in a very violent manner.  Defendants Little, Calapini, \n11  Fliehman and McGinnis purportedly failed to timely respond or provide life-saving \n12  intervention or treatment to Decedent.  Decedent died in his cell. \n13  Since that time, the Sutter County Grand Jury issued a report finding, among \n14  other things, that the Jail has known deficiencies with relation to its provision of mental \n15  health care and medical treatment to inmates.  For example, the Grand Jury found \n16  deficiencies such as inadequate medical staffing, lack of required training on suicide \n17  prevention and other medical treatment, non-compliant medical policies and procedures \n18  and a non-compliant medical program.  According to the Grand Jury, those deficiencies \n19  were “unacceptable.”  Plaintiffs also allege that, since Decedent’s death, several other \n20  inmates have also passed away from preventable causes.   \n21  By this suit, Plaintiffs now assert eleven causes of action against Defendants \n22  arising out of Decedent’s death.  Defendants move to dismiss each claim and/or for a \n23  more definitive statement and move to strike Plaintiffs’ prayer for punitive damages.  For \n24  the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ Motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. \n25  /// \n26  /// \n27  /// \n28  /// \n  6\n \n \n\n \n1  STANDARD  \n2  A. Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim. \n3   \n4  On a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil \n5  Procedure 12(b)(6)5, all allegations of material fact must be accepted as true and \n6  construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  Cahill v. Liberty Mut. Ins. \n7  Co., 80 F.3d 336, 337-38 (9th Cir. 1996).  Rule 8(a)(2) “requires only ‘a short and plain \n8  statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,’ in order to ‘give the \n9  defendant fair notice of what the...claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.’”   Bell. \n10  Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, \n11  47 (1957)).  A complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not require \n12  detailed factual allegations.  Id.  However, “a plaintiff’s obligation to provide the grounds \n13  of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic \n14  recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.”  Id.  (internal citations and \n15  quotations omitted).  A court is not required to accept as true a “legal conclusion \n16  couched as a factual allegation.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting \n17  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555).  The Court also is not required “to accept as true allegations \n18  that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences.”  \n19  In re Gilead Sciences Sec. Litig., 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008) (internal citations \n20  and quotations omitted).  “Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief \n21  above the speculative level.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. \n22  Furthermore, “Rule 8(a)(2)...requires a ‘showing,’ rather than a blanket assertion, \n23  of entitlement to relief.”  Id. at 556 n.3 (internal citations and quotations omitted).  \n24  “Without some factual allegation in the complaint, it is hard to see how a claimant could \n25  satisfy the requirements of providing not only ‘fair notice’ of the nature of the claim, but \n26  also ‘grounds’ on which the claim rests.”  Id.  (citation omitted).   \n27                                              \n5 All further references to “Rule” or “Rules” are to the Federal Rules of Civil \n28  Procedure unless otherwise noted. \n  7\n \n \n\n \n1  A pleading must contain “only enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on \n2  its face.”  Id. at 570.  If the “plaintiffs...have not nudged their claims across the line from \n3  conceivable to plausible, their complaint must be dismissed.”  Id.  However, “a well-\n4  pleaded complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those \n5  facts is improbable, and ‘that a recovery is very remote and unlikely.’”  Id. at 556 (quoting \n6  Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236 (1974)). \n7  A court granting a motion to dismiss a complaint must then decide whether to \n8  grant leave to amend.  Leave to amend should be “freely given” where there is no \n9  “undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant,...undue prejudice to \n10  the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, [or] futility of the \n11  amendment....”  Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); Eminence Capital, LLC v. \n12  Aspeon, Inc., 316 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir. 2003) (listing the Foman factors as those to \n13  be considered when deciding whether to grant leave to amend).  Dismissal without leave \n14  to amend is proper only if it is clear that “the complaint could not be saved by any \n15  amendment.”  Intri-Plex Techs., Inc. v. Crest Group, Inc., 499 F.3d 1048, 1056 (9th Cir. \n16  2007) (internal citations and quotations omitted). \n17   \n18  B. Motion for More Definite Statement.  \n19   \n20  Before interposing a responsive pleading, a defendant may move for a more \n21  definitive statement if “a pleading...is so vague or ambiguous that the party cannot \n22  reasonably prepare a response.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(e).  A Rule 12(e) motion is proper \n23  when the plaintiff’s complaint is so indefinite that the defendant cannot ascertain the \n24  nature of the claim being asserted.  Gay-Straight Alliance Network v. Visalia Unified Sch. \n25  Dist., 262 F. Supp. 2d 1088, 1099 (E.D. Cal. 2001). \n26  /// \n27  /// \n28  /// \n  8\n \n \n\n \n1  Due to the liberal pleading standards in the federal courts embodied in Rule 8(e) \n2  and the availability of extensive discovery, courts should not freely grant motions for \n3  more definitive statements.  Famolare, Inc. v. Edison Bros. Stores, Inc., 525 F. Supp. \n4  940, 949 (E.D. Cal. 1981).  Indeed, a motion for a more definitive statement should be \n5  denied unless the information sought by the moving party is not available or is not \n6  ascertainable through discovery.  Id. \n7   \n8  ANALYSIS \n9  A. Plaintiffs’ first claim for relief against the individual Defendants for their \ndeliberate indifference to Decedent’s serious medical needs.  \n10   \n \n11   \n12  In their first through third causes of action, Plaintiffs seek relief under the \n13  Fourteenth Amendment for the individual Defendants’ alleged deliberate indifference to \n14  Decedent’s serious medical needs.  As opposed to prisoner claims under the Eighth \n15  Amendment, a pretrial detainee is entitled to be free of cruel and unusual punishment \n16  under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. \n17  520, 537 n.16 (1979); Simmons v. Navajo Cnty., Ariz., 609 F.3d 1011, 1017-18 (9th Cir. \n18  2010).  A pretrial detainee’s due process right in this regard is violated when a defendant \n19  fails to promptly and reasonably procure competent medical aid when the pretrial \n20  detainee suffers a serious illness or injury while confined.  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. \n21  97, 104-05 (1976).  In order to establish a plausible claim for failure to provide medical \n22  treatment, a plaintiff must plead sufficient facts to permit the Court to infer that: \n23  (1) Decedent had a “serious medical need”; and (2) a Defendant was “deliberately \n24  indifferent” to that need.  Jett v. Penner, 439 F.3d 1091, 1096 (9th Cir. 2006); cf. Farmer \n25  v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994).  A serious medical need exists when “failure to \n26  treat a prisoner’s condition could result in further significant injury or the unnecessary \n27  and wanton infliction of pain.”  Jett, 439 F.3d at 1096 (internal citations and quotations \n28  omitted).   \n  9\n \n \n\n \n1  The deliberate indifference standard has been specifically applied to inmates’ suicide \n2  prevention.  Clouthier v. County of Contra Costa, 591 F.3d 1232, 1241 (9th Cir. 2010).   \n3  The Supreme Court, in Farmer, explained in detail the contours of the “deliberate \n4  indifference” standard.  Specifically, a Defendant is not liable under the Fourteenth \n5  Amendment for his part in allegedly denying necessary medical care unless he knew “of \n6  and disregard[ed] an excessive risk to [Decedent’s] health or safety.”  511 U.S. at 837.  \n7  Deliberate indifference lies “somewhere between the poles of negligence at one end and \n8  purpose or knowledge at the other.”  Id. at 836.  Deliberate indifference contains both an \n9  objective and subjective component: “the official must both be aware of facts from which \n10  the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must \n11  also draw that inference.”  Id.  Plaintiffs “need not show that a prison official acted or \n12  failed to act believing that harm actually would befall an inmate; it is enough that the \n13  official acted or failed to act despite his knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm.”  \n14  Id. at 842.  \n \n15  With regard to the subjective “knowledge” component, the Supreme Court \nheld that: [Whether a defendant] had the requisite knowledge of a \n16  substantial risk is a question of fact subject to demonstration in the usual \nways, including inference from circumstantial evidence ... and a fact finder \n17  may conclude that a prison official knew of a substantial risk from the very \nfact that the risk was obvious. \n18 \n19  Id. (emphasis added).  However, it is not enough to demonstrate that a reasonable \n20  person should have known of the risk.  A reasonable trier of fact must be able to properly \n21  infer that the particular Defendant did in fact know of the risk.  Id. at 842-843; see also \n22  Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 299 (1991).  The threshold for inaction to constitute \n23  deliberate indifference is high.  See Conn v. City of Reno, 591 F.3d 1081, 1097 (9th Cir. \n24  2009) (holding that the magnitude of the risk must be “so obvious that [the defendant] \n25  must have been subjectively aware of it”). \n26  /// \n27  /// \n28  /// \n  10\n \n \n\n \n1  The crux of the individual Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ first cause of \n2  action is that “Plaintiffs admit [Decedent] was seen by mental health providers, and was \n3  prescribed medications, but fall short of alleging any Defendant was aware of any \n4  suicidal ideation for which they failed to reasonably act.”  Motion, 1:20-2:1.  Defendants \n5  are correct that the TAC contains no allegation indicating Decedent ever stated he was \n6  suicidal.  The Court nonetheless finds Plaintiffs’ remaining allegations sufficient to state a \n7  deliberate indifference claim against each of the individual Defendants for, as explained \n8  below: 1) improper transfer of Decedent from SYMHS to the Jail; 2) failure to provide \n9  medical care at the Jail; and 3) failure to transfer Decedent from the Jail to the State \n10  Hospital.   \n11   \n1.  Improper transfer from SYMHS to the Jail (against Defendants \n12  Barnett and Fliehman).   \n13   \n14  Plaintiffs’ deliberate indifference cause of action arising out of Decedent’s \n15  purportedly improper discharge from SYMHS for transfer to the Jail is directed at \n16  Defendants Barnett and Fliehman.  As to Barnett, Plaintiffs contend he failed to properly \n17  complete a suicide assessment when Decedent was discharged to the Jail, despite \n18  having been held for less than the 72-hours mandated by state law.  See Cal. Welf. & \n19  Inst. Code § 5152(a).  Barnett purportedly confirmed Decedent’s diagnosis of Bipolar I \n20  disorder, Manic with Severe Psychotic Features, and recommended interventions, \n21  including provision of a “safe and structured milieu” and “redirection as required [and] \n22  observ[ation] for safety” to protect Decedent.  TAC, ¶ 83.  In addition, Barnett determined \n23  that Decedent required at least two additional weeks of involuntary psychiatric \n24  hospitalization pursuant to Section 5250.  Barnett nonetheless discharged Decedent just \n25  one day into his involuntary hold, despite having the subjective knowledge that the Jail \n26  “could not, and would not, provide the necessary hospital-level treatment” Decedent \n27  required.  Id., ¶¶ 88-89.   \n28  /// \n  11\n \n \n\n \n1  Given Plaintiffs’ allegations that Barnett was subjectively aware that Decedent’s \n2  condition posed safety concerns, and that Barnett disregarded those concerns in \n3  discharging Decedent, Plaintiffs have adequately stated a claim against this Defendant. \n4  Plaintiffs similarly aver that Fliehman improperly booked Decedent into the Jail \n5  without conducting an adequate assessment of his suicide risk and that Fliehman thus \n6  erroneously placed Decedent in a general population jail cell.  According to Plaintiffs, \n7  Fliehman had access to and reviewed Decedent’s discharge documentation and other \n8  SYMHS materials indicating that he had been committed due to his grave disability, that \n9  he was psychotic, grandiose and delusional, with markedly impaired insight and \n10  judgment and that he had been further diagnosed as described above.  Despite this \n11  knowledge, Fliehman allegedly placed Decedent in a general population single cell \n12  without providing for appropriate safety observations.  These allegations are sufficient \n13  under Rule 8 to support an inference that Fliehman knew Decedent suffered from a \n14  serious mental illness that could result in his self-harm and that Fliehman was \n15  deliberately indifferent to that risk.  Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is \n16  DENIED as to both Barnett and Fliehman. \n17   \n18  2.  Failure to provide medical care at the Jail (against Defendants Zil, \nLittle, Calapini, R.C., Mullin and McGinnis). \n19 \n \n20 \n21  First, as to Defendant Zil, Decedent’s treating physician at the Jail, Plaintiffs \n22  allege he prescribed Decedent lithium, a drug used to treat bipolar disorder and to \n23  reduce the risk of self-harm.  Plaintiffs further aver that Zil knew that Decedent had been \n24  involuntarily hospitalized, that he was delusional, that he was diagnosed with psychosis, \n25  that he was expressing grandiose ideas and that he was refusing to take his prescribed \n26  medication.  Finally, Plaintiffs allege that Zil authored a Sutter County Jail Suicide \n27  Prevention Handbook, in which he listed many of Decedent’s symptoms as “well-known \n28  signs of suicide risk among jail inmates.”  TAC, ¶ 104.   \n  12\n \n \n\n \n1  Based on these facts, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Zil knew Plaintiff had a \n2  serious mental illness that could result in his own self-harm and that Zil was deliberately \n3  indifferent to that risk.  Zil’s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ first cause of action is thus \n4  DENIED.  \n5  Plaintiffs’ allegations as to Defendants Calapini, Little, Mullin, McGinnis and R.C. \n6  are sufficient as well.  According to Plaintiffs, each of these Defendants was aware that \n7  Decedent: 1)  had been transferred to the Jail from SYMHS where he was being \n8  involuntarily hospitalized pursuant to Section 5150; 2) was still delusional, suffering from \n9  hallucinations or was psychotic;  3) was engaging in acts of self-harm in his cell; and 4) \n10  was refusing psychiatric medications, which placed Decedent at increased risk of self-\n11  harm and suicide.  These allegations, taken together, support the inference that each \n12  Defendant, “knowing of Decedent’s need for a different treatment, disregarded \n13  Decedent’s serious medical needs and therefore deliberately denied, delayed or \n14  interfered with that treatment, thus exhibiting deliberate indifference.”  Smith v. County of \n15  San Diego, 2012 WL 628307, *5 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 27, 2012).  Defendants’ Motion to \n16  Dismiss Plaintiffs’ first cause of action as to Calapini, Little, Mullin, McGinnis and R.C. is \n17  thus DENIED.   \n18   \n19  3.  Failure to transfer Decedent from the Jail to the State Hospital \n(against Defendants Parker, Samson, Bidwell and Facility \n20  Manager).  \n21   \n22  Plaintiffs’ deliberate indifference claim against Defendants Parker, Samson, \n23  Bidwell and the Jail Facility Manager is based on their failure to timely transfer Plaintiff to \n24  the Napa State Hospital.  According to Plaintiffs, on April 19, 2010, Decedent was \n25  ordered to be promptly transferred to that psychiatric facility.  That order was placed in a \n26  county file that was available to SYMHS and Jail staff.  Plaintiffs aver that Defendant \n27  Parker knew or should have known of this order and that he failed to timely effect \n28  Decedent’s transfer.   \n  13\n \n \n\n \n1  Plaintiffs likewise contend that Defendant Samson, who was responsible for inmate \n2  admissions and discharges, and Defendant Bidwell, who was also responsible for \n3  transfer of mentally or medically ill inmates, were both informed or should have been \n4  informed of that order and that the Facility Manager reviewed the April 19 transfer order \n5  as well.  Finally, Plaintiffs contend that Napa State Hospital had notified Sutter County \n6  that Decedent was approved for admission and that each Defendant had been informed \n7  of such approval.  These Defendants nonetheless failed to timely effectuate Decedent’s \n8  transfer.  Accordingly, despite their knowledge of Decedent’s psychiatric history already \n9  detailed above, Defendants were deliberately indifferent to Decedent’s need for inpatient \n10  treatment.  Plaintiffs have thus adequately stated a claim here, and Defendants’ Motion \n11  to Dismiss is DENIED as to Parker, Samson, Bidwell and Facility Manager.   \n12   \n13  B. Plaintiffs’ first and second claims for relief against the County of Sutter \nand County of Yuba for deliberate indifference to Decedent’s serious \n14  medical needs.  \n15   \n16  A municipality may be liable for violating a party’s constitutional rights resulting \n17  from a policy, ordinance, or regulation pursuant to a governmental custom.  Monell v. \n18  Dep’t of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658 (1978).  The policy must be the “moving force” \n19  behind the constitutional violation.  Villegas v. Gilroy Garlic Festival Ass’n, 541 F.3d 950, \n20  957 (9th Cir. 2008).  Section 1983 requires that there is an actual connection or link \n21  between the actions of a defendant and the deprivation alleged to have been suffered by \n22  the plaintiff.  Id.  In sum, to survive Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, then, Plaintiffs must \n23  allege sufficient facts to permit the court to infer the plausibility of each of the following \n24  elements: (1) an employee violated the Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights; (2) the municipality \n25  has customs or policies that amount to deliberate indifference to those rights; and (3) \n26  those customs or policies where the moving force behind the violation of the employee’s \n27  constitutional rights.  Gibson v. County of Washoe, 290 F.3d 1175, 1193-94 (9th Cir. \n28  2002).   \n  14\n \n \n\n \n1  By way of their Motion to Dismiss, Defendants contend first that Plaintiffs have \n2  failed to allege an underlying constitutional violation as required under Monell.  Second, \n3  Defendants point out a distinction between a one-time occurrence and a more \n4  comprehensive or ongoing policy.  Lastly, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs fail to allege a \n5  causal connection between any policy and the resulting constitutional violations.  In other \n6  words, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that Defendants’ \n7  omissions directly caused Decedent’s suicide.   \n8  First, as detailed above, Plaintiffs’ TAC adequately alleges constitutional \n9  violations by employees of both the County of Sutter and the County of Yuba.  In \n10  addition, Plaintiffs specifically allege the existence of a number of the entity Defendants’ \n11  policies, customs or practices that purportedly contributed to Decedent’s death.  Namely, \n12  Plaintiffs allege that those policies and practices include, but are not limited to, the \n13  following:  \n \n14  Failure to conduct appropriate and complete suicide assessments; \n15  Failure to create and implement appropriate mental health treatment \nplans; \n16 \nFailure to follow clinical judgments and recommendations; \n17 \nFailure to promptly evaluate and transfer inmates to a psychiatric hospital \n18  who are gravely disabled and at risk of serious harm; \n19  Failure to take precautions to prevent suicide among high risk and \nmentally ill inmates; \n20 \nFailure to implement appropriate emergency treatment policies; \n21 \nFailure to provide appropriate staffing and training at the Jail to provide \n22  minimally adequate treatment for seriously ill inmates. \n23  TAC, ¶ 159.  Given the early stage of this litigation, in which the facts are not fully \n24  developed, the Court declines to hold that Plaintiffs cannot plausibly show that the above \n25  policies, procedures or customs amount to deliberate indifference.   \n26  /// \n27  /// \n28  /// \n  15\n \n \n\n \n1  Finally, any of these policies could likewise plausibly be found to be the “moving \n2  force” behind the constitutional violation alleged here.  “[F]or liability to attach in this \n3  circumstance the identified deficiency in a city's training program must be closely related \n4  to the ultimate injury.” City of Canton, Ohio v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 391 (1989).  In other \n5  words, there must be a causal link between the municipal policy or custom and the \n6  claimed constitutional violation.  Id.  The “closely related” or “moving force” requirement \n7  is akin to the tort law causation standard of proximate cause.  See Harper v. City of Los \n8  Angeles, 533 F.3d 1010, 1026 (9th Cir. 2008).  “[P]roximate cause, although derived \n9  from tort law, fairly describes a Plaintiffs’ causation burden with respect to a municipal \n10  liability claim under § 1983.”  Cash v. County of Erie, 654 F.3d 324, 342 (2d Cir. 2011) \n11  (internal citations omitted).  Specifically, the court must determine whether the \n12  constitutional deprivation was a foreseeable result of the alleged inadequate training.  \n13  Cf. Arnold v. International Business Machines Corp., 637 F.2d 1350, 1355 (9th Cir. \n14  1981) (explaining that causation in the context of certain Section 1983 cases “closely \n15  resembles the standard ‘foreseeability’ formulation of proximate cause”).  Again based \n16  on the early stage at which this question is presented here, and drawing all inferences in \n17  Plaintiffs’ favor, the Court cannot hold as a matter of law that the entity Defendants’ \n18  policies were not the moving force behind the deprivation of Decedent’s constitutional \n19  rights.6  Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss the first and second causes of action as to the \n20  County of Sutter and the County of Yuba is thus DENIED. \n                                            \n21 \n6 The Court’s decision is not changed by the existence of an express policy \nrequiring that “[i]nmates with suspected mental disorders, who are a potential danger to \n22 \nthemselves or others or appear to be gravely disabled shall be promptly evaluated and, \n23  if clinically indicated, transferred to an appropriate psychiatric treatment \nfacility….Regardless of the time of presentation, significantly disordered behavior should \n24  be evaluated promptly, within twenty-four hours at the latest.  The Jail Lieutenant or Jail \nFacility Manager will be contacted and will make every effort to transfer mentally \n25 \ndisordered inmates to appropriate treatment facilities.  All attempts and efforts to \nimplement the transfer of such inmates, whether successful or not, shall be \n26 \ndocumented.”  TAC, ¶ 127.  Rather, if, as alleged in the TAC, a valid policy is either \n27  unconstitutionally applied or not applied, “the city is liable if the employee has not been \nadequately trained and the constitutional wrong has been caused by that failure to train.”  \n28  City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 387. \n  16\n \n \n\n \n1  C. Plaintiffs’ first and third claims for relief against the Supervisory \nDefendants for deliberate indifference to Decedent’s serious medical \n2  needs.  \n3   \n4  Defendants move to dismiss claims against Defendants Parker, Samson and \n5  Bidwell on “supervisory liability” grounds.  Plaintiffs argue that each of said Defendants \n6  knew that Decedent was prematurely and improperly transferred to Sutter County Jail \n7  and that Defendants improperly created an environment in which credentialed custody \n8  staff did not possess the authority to determine who could be sent to the hospital.  \n9  Plaintiffs assert that Defendants Parker, Samson and Bidwell “tacitly encouraged, ratified \n10  and/or approved of the acts and/or omissions” which allegedly violated Decedent’s \n11  constitutional rights.  TAC, ¶ 166.  Plaintiffs argue that the Court should infer that \n12  ignoring inmates’ serious medical needs was customary and wrongfully condoned by \n13  said Defendants.  For their part, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’ allegations are too \n14  vague and inchoate because they lack specific facts regarding each supervisory \n15  Defendant’s role in the alleged constitutional violations.    \n16  “In order for a person acting under color of state law to be liable under section \n17  1983 there must be a showing of personal participation in the alleged rights deprivation: \n18  there is no respondeat superior liability under section 1983.”  Jones v. Williams, 297 F.3d \n19  930, 934 (9th Cir. 2002).  “Supervisory liability is imposed against a supervisory official in \n20  his individual capacity for his own culpable action or inaction in the training, supervision, \n21  or control of his subordinates, for his acquiescence in the constitutional deprivations of \n22  which the complaint is made, or for conduct that showed a reckless or callous \n23  indifference to the rights of others.”  Menotti v. City of Seattle, 409 F.3d 1113, 1149 (9th \n24  Cir. 2005) (quoting Larez v. City of Los Angeles, 946 F.2d 630, 646 (9th Cir. 1991)).  In \n25  other words, each government official may only be held liable for his own misconduct.  \n26  Bowell v. Cal. Substance Abuse Treatment Facility, 2011 WL 2224817, at *4 (E.D. Cal. \n27  June 7, 2011).  \n28  /// \n  17\n \n \n\n \n1  However, government officials acting as supervisors may be liable under § 1983 \n2  under certain circumstances.  A defendant may be held liable as a supervisor under § \n3  1983 if there exists either: “(1) his or her personal involvement in the Constitutional \n4  deprivation, or (2) a sufficient causal connection between the supervisor’s wrongful \n5  conduct and the constitutional violation.”  Hansen v. Black, 885 F.2d 642, 646 (9th Cir. \n6  1989).  Thus, Section 1983 actions against supervisors are proper “as long as a \n7  sufficient causal connection is present and the plaintiff was deprived under color of law \n8  of a federally secured right.”  Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1207 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting \n9  Redman v. County of San Diego, 942 F.2d 1435, 1447 (9th Cir. 1991)). \n10  The requisite causal connection between a supervisor’s wrongful conduct and the \n11  violation of the prisoner’s constitutional rights can be established in a number of ways.  \n12  Plaintiffs may show that a supervisor set in motion a series of acts by others, or \n13  knowingly refused to terminate a series of acts by others, which the supervisor knew or \n14  reasonably should have known would cause others to inflict a Constitutional injury.  \n15  Dubner v. City of San Francisco, 266 F.3d 959, 968 (9th Cir. 2001).  Similarly, a \n16  supervisor’s own culpable action or inaction in the training, supervision, or control of his \n17  subordinates may establish supervisory liability.  Starr, 652 F.3d at 1208.  Finally, a \n18  supervisor’s acquiescence in the alleged constitutional deprivation, or conduct showing \n19  deliberate indifference toward the possibility that deficient performance of the task may \n20  violate the rights of others, may establish the requisite causal connection.  Id.; Menotti, \n21  409 F.3d at 1149. \n22  The Court dismissed Plaintiffs’ supervisory liability claim in their First Amended \n23  Complaint on the basis that it did not sufficiently plead facts demonstrating each \n24  supervisory Defendant’s role in any alleged deprivation.  However, the additional facts \n25  pled in Plaintiffs’ TAC allow the Court to infer that a reasonable trier of fact, after \n26  discovery, could reasonably find that the supervisory Defendants were aware of and \n27  failed to act on constitutional violations regularly practiced by the Sutter County Jail.   \n28  /// \n  18\n \n \n\n \n1  The very fact that, as alleged, Decedent’s court-ordered transfer, which could have \n2  saved his life, was purportedly disregarded implicates the supervisors because the type \n3  of error alleged suggests that the mistake was a result of flawed measures which were \n4  likely implemented by employees in managerial roles.  Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss \n5  Plaintiffs’ Supervisory Liability claim against Defendants Parker, Samson and Bidwell is \n6  therefore DENIED. \n7   \n8  D. Plaintiffs fourth claim for relief for loss of parent/child relationship.  \n9   \n10  Plaintiffs’ fourth cause of action asserts that all Defendants violated the First and \n11  Fourteenth Amendments by depriving Plaintiffs of their liberty interest in the parent-child \n12  relationship.  Defendants attack those allegations on the basis that Plaintiffs’ allegations \n13  are so overly broad that they fail to state a claim.   \n14  The due process claim protects the right to familial relations between family \n15  members.  See, e.g., Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651 (1972) (“The integrity of the \n16  family unit has found protection in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \n17  Amendment....”) (citing Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399 (1923)).  However, only \n18  official conduct that “shocks the conscience” is cognizable as a due process violation.   \n19  County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 846 (1998) (citing Rochin v. Cal., 342 \n20  U.S. 165, 172-73 (1952)).  The threshold question in such cases is “whether the \n21  behavior of the governmental officer is so egregious, so outrageous, that it may fairly be \n22  said to shock the contemporary conscience.”  Lewis, 523 U.S. at 847 n. 8.  The type of \n23  conduct which is most likely to rise to the “conscience-shocking level” is “conduct \n24  intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest.”  Id. at 849.  \n25  Conduct which was not intentional, but rather was deliberately indifferent, may \n26  nevertheless rise to the conscience-shocking level in some circumstances.  Id. at 849–\n27  50.  \n28  /// \n  19\n \n \n\n \n1  Plaintiffs’ instant claim is predicated on the allegations set forth in Plaintiffs’ first, \n2  second, and third causes of action.  More specifically, Plaintiffs allege that the \n3  “aforementioned acts and/or omissions of Defendants in being deliberatively indifferent \n4  to [Decedent],” through their direct actions or failure to take measures to prevent \n5  Decedent’s suicide, amount to a violation of the Plaintiffs’ rights under the substantive \n6  due process clauses of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  TAC, ¶ 171.  For the \n7  same reasons already discussed in the preceding sections, Plaintiffs’ allegations that \n8  Defendants were deliberately indifferent to Decedent’s serious medical needs are \n9  likewise sufficient to demonstrate that any Defendant’s conduct “shocks the conscience.”  \n10  Indeed, Plaintiffs have pled adequate facts demonstrating that Defendants’ conduct \n11  meets the requisite standard to establish a substantive due process violation.  \n12  Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ fourth claim for relief is DENIED.   \n13   \n14  E.  Plaintiffs’ fifth claim for relief for violation of Title II of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  \n15 \n \n16 \n17  In their fifth cause of action, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants County of Sutter and \n18  County of Yuba discriminated against Decedent in violation of the Americans with \n19  Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12101, et seq., and Section 504 of the \n20  Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, et seq., “based on the denial of appropriate \n21  placement, services, and setting that were necessary to reasonably accommodate his \n22  mental disability needs” at the Jail.  TAC, ¶ 180.  Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants \n23  failed to provide accommodations for Decedent’s disability, “resulting in the denial of the \n24  benefits of the Jail’s services, programs, and/or activities that included the care and \n25  custody necessary for an inmate to survive his pre-trial detention without serious injury.”  \n26  Id., ¶ 132.   \n27  /// \n28  /// \n  20\n \n \n\n \n1  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ claims under the ADA and Section 504 of the \n2  Rehabilitation Act must be dismissed because Plaintiffs fail to present facts identifying \n3  how Decedent was denied treatment, or which particular programs Decedent was denied \n4  access to, because of his disability.  In their Opposition, Plaintiffs argue that their claims \n5  are based on Defendants’ total withholding of treatment for Decedent and aver that \n6  Decedent was “unable to access the care available to non-disabled inmates.”  \n7  Opposition, 20:15-16.         \n8  Both the ADA and Rehabilitation Act prohibit disability discrimination.  Specifically, \n9  Title II of the ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason \n10  of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the \n11  services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subject to discrimination by such \n12  entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  The ADA defines “public entity” in relevant part as “any \n13  State or local government” or “any department, agency, special purpose district, or other \n14  instrumentality of a State or States or local government,” 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1)(A)-(B), \n15  and the Supreme Court has found that “[s]tate prisons fall squarely within the [statute’s] \n16  definition of public entity.”  Pennsylvania Dep’t of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, \n17  210 (1952) (internal quotations and citations omitted).  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \n18  Act states that “[n]o otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States . . . \n19  shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied \n20  the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving \n21  Federal financial assistance.”  29 U.S.C. § 794.  Both the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \n22  have been found to apply to services, programs and activities for detainees.  See, e.g., \n23  Pierce v. County of Orange, 526 F.3d 1190, 1214-1215 (9th Cir. 2008).  \n24  Although Plaintiffs allege Decedent did not receive adequate medical treatment, \n25  there are no facts in the TAC demonstrating that Defendants did not provide treatment to \n26  Decedent because he was disabled.  See Alexander v. Tilton, 2009 WL 464486, at *7 \n27  (E.D. Cal. Feb. 24, 2009) (finding plaintiff’s allegations that he didn’t receive proper \n28  medical treatment did not state a claim under the ADA or Rehabilitation Act).   \n  21\n \n \n\n \n1  Put differently, Plaintiffs have not pled that Decedent was treated differently than other \n2  inmates who did not suffer from a disability.  Peacock v. Terhune, 2002 WL 459928, at \n3  *2 (E.D. Cal. Jan. 23, 2002) (finding a plaintiff stated a claim under the ADA because he \n4  alleged he was treated differently as a paraplegic than other inmates who did not suffer \n5  from the same or a similar disability).  While Plaintiffs continue to allege that Decedent \n6  had a greater risk of harm than other inmates, they fail to show that Decedent was \n7  denied benefits that others were offered.  Indeed, Plaintiffs do not allege that any other \n8  inmates were offered mental health services or in-house clinical visits that Decedent was \n9  denied. \n10  Therefore, because the pleadings do not adequately demonstrate that the other \n11  inmates were offered any services that Decedent was denied as a result of his disability, \n12  this Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to plead facts sufficient to allege that the \n13  Defendants discriminated against Decedent because of his disability.  Defendants’ \n14  Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ fifth cause of action is thus GRANTED with leave to amend.     \n15   \n16  F.  Plaintiffs’ sixth claim for relief for violation of California’s Unruh Civil \nRights Act.  \n17 \n \n18 \n19  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants County of Sutter and County of Yuba violated \n20  California Civil Code §§ 51 and 52 (“Unruh Act”) by failing to reasonably accommodate \n21  Decedent’s disability and treatment needs.  Defendants argue Plaintiffs’ claim must be \n22  dismissed because SYMHS and Sutter County Jail are not “business establishments” \n23  subject to the Unruh Act.  \n24  The Unruh Act prohibits “business establishments” from engaging in intentional \n25  discrimination.  Cal. Civ. Code § 51(b).  Although the California Supreme Court has \n26  found that “the Legislature intended the phrase ‘business establishment’ be interpreted \n27  ‘in the broadest sense reasonably possible,’” the Unruh Act has yet to be applied to \n28  claims against correctional facilities. \n  22\n \n \n\n \n1  Isbister v. Boys’ Club of Santa Cruz, Inc., 40 Cal. 3d 72, 78 (1985) (internal citations \n2  omitted).  Instead, several district courts have explicitly found that prisons are not \n3  business establishments under the Unruh Act.  See, e.g., Taormina v. Cal. Dep’t of \n4  Corr., 946 F. Supp. 829, 834 (S.D. Cal. 1996); Wilkins-Jones v. County of Alameda, \n5  2010 WL 4780291, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 16, 2010).  The Court finds this authority \n6  persuasive and holds that Sutter County Jail is not a business establishment under the \n7  Unruh Act.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs claim under the Unruh Act arising out of Decedent’s \n8  treatment at Sutter County Jail fails.   \n9  Plaintiffs nonetheless correctly argue that SYMHS is subject to the Unruh Act \n10  because it is a public health facility.  Numerous courts have considered medical facilities \n11  to be business facilities.  See, e.g., North Coast Women’s Care Med. Group, Inc. v. San \n12  Diego County Superior Court, 44 Cal. 4th 1145, 1153 (2008) (“A medical group providing \n13  medical services to the public has been held to be a business establishment for \n14  purposes of the [Unruh] Act.”) (hereafter, “North Coast”); Washington v. Blampin, 226 \n15  Cal. App. 2d 604 (Cal. App. 1964) (“There is nothing novel in referring to the practice of \n16  medicine as a business.”).  Defendants contend that the case Plaintiffs rely on, North \n17  Coast, is distinguishable because it concerns a private medical group and SYMHS is a \n18  public medical facility.  This argument is unpersuasive because the Unruh Act prohibits \n19  discrimination in places of public accommodation and covers “all business \n20  establishments of every kind whatsoever.”  Warfield v. Peninsula Golf & Country Club, \n21  10 Cal. 4th 594, 599-615 (1995); Isbister, 40 Cal. 3d at 75.  This Court therefore now \n22  holds that a public medical facility is a “business establishment” for purposes of the \n23  Unruh Act.  See Isbister, 40 Cal. 3d at 75. \n24  That being said, the Unruh Act provides that “[a]ll persons within the jurisdiction of \n25  this state are free and equal, and...are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, \n26  advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments of every kind \n27  whatsoever.”  Cal. Civ. Code § 51(b).   \n28  /// \n  23\n \n \n\n \n1  The purpose of the Unruh Act “is to compel a recognition of the equality of citizens in the \n2  right to the peculiar service afforded” by the entities covered by the acts.  Marina Point, \n3  Ltd. v. Wolfson, 30 Cal. 3d 721, 738 (1982) (quoting Piluso v. Spencer, 36 Cal. App. \n4  416, 419 (Cal. Ct. App. 1918)).  In addition, the Unruh Civil Rights Act protects only \n5  against intentional discrimination.  Pack v. Fort Washington II, 689 F. Supp. 2d 1237, \n6  1249 (E.D. Cal. 2009).  Nowhere in Plaintiffs’ TAC do they adequately suggest SYMHS \n7  engaged in intentional discrimination again Decedent, as prohibited by Cal. Civ. Code \n8  § 51(b).  Thus, Plaintiffs do not adequately allege SYMHS discriminated against \n9  Decedent.  Accordingly, because Plaintiffs cannot establish that Sutter County Jail is a \n10  “business establishment,” or that SYMHS intentionally discriminated against Decedent, \n11  Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ Unruh Act claim is GRANTED with leave to \n12  amend.  \n13   \n14  G. Plaintiffs’ seventh claim for relief for professional negligence/medical \nmalpractice. \n15 \n \n16 \n17  Plaintiffs allege Zil and Barnett were negligent in their failure to properly assess \n18  and treat Decedent’s serious mental illness, to prescribe necessary psychiatric \n19  medication, to ensure compliance with that medication, and to ensure proper treatment.  \n20  Plaintiffs further allege that Defendant Barnett was negligent in discharging Decedent \n21  from SYMHS to Sutter County Jail in early April 2010.   \n22  These Defendants argue to the contrary that they are immune from liability under \n23  California Government Code §§ 855.6 and 855.8.  Section 855.6 shields a public \n24  employee from liability “for injury caused by the failure to make a[n] examination, or to \n25  make an adequate [] examination,...for the purpose of determining whether [a] person \n26  has a...mental condition that would constitute a hazard to the health and safety of \n27  himself or others.”   \n28  /// \n  24\n \n \n\n \n1  Similarly, Section 855.8 provides that a public employee is not liable “for injury resulting \n2  from diagnosing or failing to diagnose that a person is afflicted with mental illness [] or \n3  from failing to prescribe for mental illness....”  Cal. Gov. Code § 855.8(a).  Defendants \n4  argue that Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding their alleged failure to properly assess and \n5  evaluate Decedent, as well as their alleged failure to prescribe appropriate medications, \n6  fall squarely within Sections 855.6 and 855.8, and therefore, they are immune from \n7  liability on that basis.   \n8  Plaintiffs nonetheless argue that the immunity granted under Section 855.6 does \n9  not apply in “situation[s] where the defendant fails to provide medical care for a prisoner \n10  in obvious need of such care,” as set forth in Lum v. City of San Joaquin, 756 F. Supp. \n11  2d 1243 (E.D. Cal. 2010).  Plaintiffs contend that Decedent was obviously in need of \n12  medical care, pointing to Decedent’s serious mental illnesses and visible symptoms \n13  stemming from those illnesses.  They argue that Zil knew of these symptoms and yet he \n14  wrongfully failed to order further evaluations or direct observation therapy.  They further \n15  allege that Barnett stated that Decedent needed at least two additional weeks of \n16  hospitalization given his symptoms and instead inappropriately (and illegally) approved \n17  Decedent’s transfer to the jail in a negligent manner.  Plaintiffs allege sufficient facts to \n18  survive dismissal with respect to claims arising out of Zil’s alleged failure to properly \n19  evaluate Decedent or prescribe medication for Decedent’s mental condition and \n20  Barnett’s failure to properly evaluate Decedent or prescribe medications and negligent \n21  discharge.  Moreover, determining whether or not Decedent’s illnesses and symptoms \n22  made it “obvious” to Defendants Zil and Barnett that Decedent was suicidal requires a \n23  heavy fact-finding process, which is best left to a jury.  Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion \n24  to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ professional negligence/medical malpractice claim is DENIED.   \n25  /// \n26  /// \n27  /// \n28  /// \n  25\n \n \n\n \n1  H. Plaintiffs’ eighth claim for relief for negligence/negligence per se \n(against Defendants Barnett and Fliehman). \n2 \n \n3 \n4  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants Barnett and Fliehman acted negligently and \n5  improperly, breached their respective duties, and as a direct and proximate result, \n6  Decedent and Plaintiffs suffered injuries and damages.  Accordingly to Plaintiffs, as \n7  already stated, Barnett was responsible for completing multiple psychiatric evaluations of \n8  Decedent, as well as for planning his treatment and placement.  In fact, Barnett allegedly \n9  ordered the involuntary emergency psychiatric hospitalization of Decedent for at least 72 \n10  hours of treatment pursuant to Section 5150, after which he determined that Decedent \n11  likely required two weeks of involuntary psychiatric hospitalization.  Yet, Barnett \n12  nonetheless discharged Decedent from the psychiatric hospital after only 24 hours, in \n13  violation of Section 5152.  In opposition, Defendants argue that, despite these facts, \n14  Plaintiffs do not adequately allege Decedent was placed on an involuntary 72-hour hold \n15  because a family member voluntarily turned him over to SYMHS so Section 5152 should \n16  not apply.  In addition, according to Defendants, the transfer did not cause Decedent’s \n17  later death, and Section 5152 was not designed to prevent this later-occurring suicide. \n18  As to Fliehman, Plaintiffs allege he violated Section 5150 when he booked \n19  Decedent in the Sutter County Jail and placed him in a general population single cell \n20  “with no direct observation for safety, although he knew or should have known that \n21  [Decedent] required at least two (2) weeks of additional involuntary psychiatric \n22  hospitalization given his psychotic condition and inability to provide for his own needs.”  \n23  TAC, ¶¶ 6-7 (emphasis in original).  In opposition here, however, Defendants argue that \n24  the booking at the jail was pursuant to the outstanding warrant, not Section 5150.  \n25  Defendants further argue that the transfer did not cause Decedent’s later death and that \n26  Section 5150 was not designed to prevent this later-occurring suicide. \n27  /// \n28  /// \n  26\n \n \n\n \n1  To allege a sufficient claim for negligence per se, Plaintiffs must identify a specific \n2  statute, ordinance, or regulation in support of their claim.  See Cal. Evid. Code § 669(a) \n3  (“The failure of a person to exercise due care is presumed if: (1) He violated a statute, \n4  ordinance, or regulation of a public entity; (2) The violation proximately caused death or \n5  injury to a person or property; (3) The death or injury resulted from an occurrence of the \n6  nature which the statute, ordinance, or regulation was designed to prevent; and (4) The \n7  person suffering the death or the injury to his person or property was one of the class of \n8  persons for whose protection the statute, ordinance, or regulation was adopted.”); \n9  accord Lorbeer v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 958 F.2d 377 (9th Cir. 1992) (finding a \n10  plaintiff’s negligence per se claim failed “because he [did] not identif[y] a specific, \n11  relevant statutory violation...”).  In light of the above arguments, the Court finds that \n12  Plaintiffs adequately allege facts that Barnett violated Section 5152 by allegedly \n13  discharging Decedent before the required 72-hour time and before finding that Decedent \n14  no longer needed treatment.  Moreover, the Court finds that Plaintiffs adequately allege \n15  facts that Fliehman violated Section 5150 when he purportedly knowingly placed \n16  Decedent into an unapproved facility incapable of providing adequate support.  \n17  Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ claim for negligence per se is \n18  DENIED. \n19   \n20  I.  Plaintiffs’ ninth claim for relief for failure to furnish/summon medical \ncare (against Defendants Little, Calapini, Fliehman, R.C., Mullin and \n21  McGinnis).   \n22   \n23  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants Little, Calapini, Fliehman, R.C., Mullin, and \n24  McGinnis knew, or had reason to know, that Decedent was in need of immediate \n25  medical and mental health care, yet they failed to take action to summon or provide care, \n26  resulting in Decedent’s death, thereby violating California Government Code §§ 844.6 \n27  and 845.6.   \n28  /// \n  27\n \n \n\n \n1  Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants failed to timely respond to Decedent’s “psychotic \n2  episode” when “he engaged in numerous acts of self-harm before hanging himself....”  \n3  TAC, ¶ 205.  Defendants nonetheless argue that Plaintiffs do not allege that these \n4  Defendants had actual or constructive knowledge that Decedent was in need of \n5  immediate medical care.   \n6  A claim for failure to furnish medical care is based on a violation of California \n7  Government Code § 845.6, which states in pertinent part: \n \n8  Neither a public entity nor a public employee is liable for injury proximately \ncaused by the failure of the employee to furnish or obtain medical care for \n9  a prisoner in his custody; but... a public employee, and the public entity \nwhere the employee is acting within the scope of his employment, is liable \n10  if the employee knows or has reason to know that the prisoner is in need \nof immediate medical care and he fails to take reasonable action to \n11  summon such medical care... \n12  Plaintiffs allege that Little “observed [Decedent] banging himself against his cell door, \n13  yelling about or at people who did not exist, describing various hallucinations, and \n14  refusing his psychiatric medication.”  TAC, ¶ 114.  Plaintiffs also allege that Officer \n15  Calapini had significant interaction with Decedent in April 2010 and that he “observed \n16  [Decedent] engaging in acts of self-harm in his cell, having delusions and hallucinations, \n17  and refusing his psychiatric medication.”  Id., ¶ 115.  Moreover, Plaintiffs allege that \n18  Fliehman was in contact with Decedent at the time he was placed and booked in the \n19  Sutter County Jail, and that Fliehman was on notice of Decedent’s psychotic condition \n20  and need for emergency treatment.  Plaintiffs further contend that Defendant R.C. “was \n21  informed on or about April 24, 2010 that [Decedent’s] condition had deteriorated to an \n22  alarming level; that he was unstable and talking to himself and to inanimate objects; and \n23  that he was refusing his medications.”  Id., ¶ 116.  They also allege that R.C. observed \n24  and documented that Decedent “was experiencing delusions and hallucinations, and \n25  was making alarming statements suggesting suicidal thoughts.”  Id., ¶ 117.   \n26  /// \n27  /// \n28  /// \n  28\n \n \n\n \n1  As to Nurses Mullin and McGinnis, Plaintiffs allege that they observed and recorded \n2  Decedent’s refusal to take his psychiatric medications, observed him engaging in acts of \n3  self-harm and having delusions and hallucinations.  Id., ¶¶ 118-19. \n4  The Court finds that Plaintiffs allege sufficient facts as to each Defendant to \n5  support the claim that each had actual or constructive knowledge that Decedent was in \n6  need of immediate medical care and that each failed to summon care.  See, e.g., Jett, \n7  439 F.3d 1091 (finding disputed issues of fact precluded summary judgment on the \n8  inmate-plaintiff’s failure to summon medical care claim because a doctor ordered follow-\n9  up visits for plaintiff following a fracture to his thumb and plaintiff filed repeated requests \n10  to be seen by a health care provider, which were ignored by defendants); see also \n11  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ claim \n12  for failure to summon medical care is DENIED. \n13   \n14  J.  Plaintiffs’ tenth claim for relief for negligent supervision, training, hiring \nand retention.  \n15 \n \n16 \n17  Plaintiffs allege Defendant County of Sutter was negligent in hiring, supervising, \n18  training, and retaining employees and thus caused Decedent’s injuries.  According to \n19  Plaintiffs, Defendant’s failure resulted in the violation of three statutes that establish a \n20  specific duty of care and/or basis for liability, including violation of Sections 5150 and \n21  5152 and of California Government Code § 845.6.  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ \n22  claim must be dismissed because Defendant is immune under California Government \n23  Code § 815 and because “California does not recognize a common law tort claim of \n24  negligence against a public entity for the negligent ‘selection, training, retention, \n25  supervision, and discipline’ of its employees.”  Motion, 20:5-12.  However, as stated in \n26  the Court’s previous Order, pursuant to California Government Code § 815, a public \n27  entity can be held directly liable in tort as specifically provided by statute.  Caldwell v. \n28  Montoya, 10 Cal. 4th 972, 980 (1995).   \n  29\n \n \n\n \n1  The Court must thus determine whether each of the alleged violated statutes \n2  imposes a mandatory duty on the County of Sutter.  Haggis v. City of Los Angeles, 22 \n3  Cal. 4th 490, 498 (2000) (“First and foremost, application of section 815.6 requires that \n4  the enactment at issue be obligatory, rather than merely discretionary or permissive, in \n5  its directions to the public entity; it must require, rather than merely authorize or permit, \n6  that a particular action be taken or not taken.”).  Courts apply the mandatory duty \n7  element “rather strictly, and generally find a mandatory duty only if the enactment \n8  imposes the duty and provides implementing measures or requires specific conduct.”  All \n9  Angels Preschool/Daycare v. County of Merced, 197 Cal. App. 4th 394, 402 n.8 (Cal. \n10  App. 2011).  The mandatory duty requires that the statute not be merely discretionary or \n11  permissive, “it must require, rather than merely authorize or permit, that a particular \n12  action be taken or not taken” by the public entity.  Haggis, 22 Cal.4th at 498. \n13  California Government Code § 845.6 imposes such a mandatory duty.  It states \n14  that a public entity “is liable if the employee knows or has reason to know that the \n15  prisoner is in need of immediate medical care and he fails to take reasonable action to \n16  summon such medical care.”   Cal. Gov. Code § 845.6 (emphasis added).  Section 5152 \n17  similarly requires that a person admitted pursuant to Section 5150 “shall be released \n18  before 72 hours have elapsed only if the psychiatrist directly responsible for the person's \n19  treatment believes, as a result of the psychiatrist's personal observations, that the \n20  person no longer requires evaluation or treatment.”  Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 5152 \n21  (emphasis added).   The Court determines that Section 5152, in its entirety, especially \n22  given its use of the phrase “only if,” imposes a mandatory duty. \n23  To the contrary, however, Section 5150 states that a person “may” be taken into \n24  custody and placed in a facility for treatment and evaluation if, as a result of mental \n25  disorder, he is a danger to others, or to himself or herself, or gravely disabled.  Use of \n26  the word “may” is permissive, and, therefore, Section 5150 does not impose a \n27  mandatory duty.   \n28  /// \n  30\n \n \n\n \n1  Accordingly, the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ negligent supervision \n2  cause of action as it pertains to Government Code § 845.6 and Section 5152 is DENIED.  \n3  The Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ negligent supervision cause of action as it \n4  pertains to Section 5150 is GRANTED with leave to amend. \n5   \n6  K. Plaintiffs’ eleventh claim for relief for wrongful death.  \n7   \n8  Plaintiffs allege that Decedent’s injuries in this case are a result of the “wrongful \n9  and/or negligent acts and/or omissions of Defendants” and, therefore, Defendants are \n10  liable under California Code of Civil Procedure § 377.60 for wrongful death.  Defendants \n11  argue that Plaintiffs fail to allege a duty or what duty was breached, and that Plaintiffs’ \n12  allegations regarding causation are conclusory.   \n13  In order to adequately allege a wrongful death claim, Plaintiffs must allege a \n14  wrongful act or neglect on the part of one or more persons that caused the death of \n15  another person.  Garcia v. County of Fresno, 2005 WL 3143429, *6 (E.D. Cal. Nov. 21, \n16  2005).  For the reasons already stated, Plaintiffs meet this standard.  Plaintiffs have \n17  alleged facts sufficient to demonstrate that Defendants’ negligence caused Decedent’s \n18  death.  Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ eleventh cause of action is \n19  DENIED.       \n20   \n21  L.  Plaintiffs’ prayer for punitive damages.  \n22   \n23  Defendants’ move to strike Plaintiffs’ request for punitive damages.  Rule 12(f), \n24  however, is the improper vehicle by which to attack damages allegations.  Whittlestone, \n25  Inc. v. Handi-Craft Co., 618 F.3d 970, 974-75 (9th Cir. 2010).  Such attacks should \n26  instead be made pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  Id.  Accordingly, the Court now construes \n27  Defendants’ instant Motion as a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). \n28  /// \n  31\n \n \n\n \n1  Defendants first attack Plaintiffs’ prayer for punitive damages against the medical \n2  Defendants (Zil, Barnett, Mullin, and McGinnis) because, prior to initiating this litigation, \n3  Plaintiffs did not petition the Court in compliance with California Code of Civil Procedure \n4  § 425.13.  To adequately plead a prayer for punitive damages against medical providers \n5  under California state law, Plaintiffs must petition the court for punitive damages \n6  pursuant to Section 425.13.  Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 425.13; Thomas v. Hickman, 2006 \n7  WL 2868967, at *39-41 (E.D.Ca., Oct. 6, 2006).  Defendants correctly point out that \n8  Plaintiffs have neither requested nor obtained an order from the Court allowing for \n9  recovery of punitive damages against medical defendants for the state claims in \n10  accordance with Section 425.13.  Id.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ prayer for punitive damages \n11  against medical defendants (i.e., Zil, Barnett, Mullins, and McGinnis) for state claims is \n12  dismissed with leave to amend. \n13  The Court must still nonetheless address Plaintiffs’ prayer for punitive damages \n14  for state claims against non-medical Defendants and for federal claims against all \n15  Defendants.  Punitive damages are appropriate in an action brought under 42 U.S.C. \n16  § 1983.  Punitive damages are available “‘when the defendant's conduct is shown to be \n17  motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to \n18  the federally protected rights of others.’” Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dept., 901 F.2d \n19  702, 707 (9th Cir. 1989) (quoting Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56 (1971)).  Under \n20  California law, “where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant \n21  has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff, in addition to the actual \n22  damages, may recover damages for the sake of example and by way of punishing the \n23  defendant.”  Cal. Civil Code § 3294(a).  Malice is defined as despicable conduct done \n24  with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others and oppression is \n25  defined as despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in \n26  conscious disregard of that person’s rights.  Id., § 3294(c). \n27  This Court has already determined that Defendants’ actions shock the \n28  conscience.  Therefore, Plaintiffs have also adequately alleged Defendants’ “conduct \n  32\n \n \n\n \n1  is…motivated by evil motive or intent” and that Defendants’ acts were malicious and \n2  oppressive.  Smith, 461 U.S. at 56; Cal. Civil Code § 3294.  Accordingly, Defendants’ \n3  Motion to Strike Plaintiffs’ Prayer for Punitive Damages, construed as a motion to \n4  dismiss, as it relates to Plaintiffs’ federal claims against the Individual Defendants and to \n5  state claims against Defendants’ Bidwell, Facility Manager, Parker, Samson, Little, \n6  Calapini, R.C. and Fliehman is DENIED.  \n7   \n8  M. Defendants’ Motion for More Definite Statement.  \n9   \n10  Defendants’ Motion for More Definite Statement is DENIED.  Plaintiffs have \n11  provided sufficient facts to survive a 12(e) motion because the pleading is not so vague \n12  or ambiguous that Defendants cannot frame a responsive pleading.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(e). \n13   \n14  CONCLUSION \n \n15 \n16  For the reasons stated above, County Defendants’ Motion (ECF No. 36) is \n17  GRANTED in part and DENIED in part, consistent with the foregoing.  Not later than \n18  twenty (20) days following the date this Memorandum and Order is electronically filed, \n19  Plaintiffs may (but are not required to) file an amended complaint on those issues as to \n20  which the motion to dismiss was granted..  If no amended complaint is filed within said \n21  twenty (20) day period, without further notice to the parties, the causes of action \n22  dismissed by virtue of this Memorandum and Order will be dismissed with prejudice. \n23  IT IS SO ORDERED.  \n24 \nDated:  August 30, 2012 \n \n25 \n__________________________________ \n26  MORRISON C.
